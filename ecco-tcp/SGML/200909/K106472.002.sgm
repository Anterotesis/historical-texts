<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> Iri&s;h origins; and progre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Dalriads from Ireland to North Britain.</HEAD>
<P>THE remote origin of the Iri&s;h &s;ettlers in North Britain, little concerns the hi&s;tory of Scotland. But as much has been writ|ten on this &s;ubject; and this work might be regarded as imperfect, without &s;ome illu&s;tra|tions upon it, a few &s;hall be propounded, with as much brevity as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>Iri&s;h Origins.</HI></HEAD>
<P>At this moment, when entering on a &s;ubject e&s;&s;ential to ancient Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, i feel my&s;elf as much a native of Ireland, as of Britain. Far from violating the reverence due to the antiqui|ties
<PB N="4" REF="8">of that noble iland, i &s;hould be happy to &s;upport and illu&s;trate them, as far as lay in my power. But having treated the antiquities of my own country, with all the freedom of an ardent en|quirer after truth, i mu&s;t beg leave to a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame philo&s;ophic privilege in re&s;pect to other realms.</P>
<P>It may be imagined that i, who confe&s;s no further knowledge of the Celtic language, than is picked up from a few grammars and dictionaries, am but ill qualified to di&s;cu&s;s a &s;ubject, who&s;e evidences are wrapt up in that language. But from complete and repeated peru&s;al of mo&s;t Iri&s;h and other writers, who have treated this matter in Latin or Engli&s;h, certainly all the information nece&s;&s;ary on this point may now be had. The works of Mageogaghan, Stanihur&s;t, Colgan, U&s;her, Ware, Keating, Maccurtin, Kennedy, O'Flaherty, O'Conor, &amp;c. &amp;c. derived from all the monuments in the Iri&s;h language, &s;urely af|ford full and &s;ufficient materials, and as complete knowlege of the original evidence, as can be procured from that evidence it&s;elf. I hope there|fore to e&s;cape any charge of ra&s;hne&s;s, while i exa|mine this important part of Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, upon the te&s;timony of Iri&s;h writers. Were i writing on the hi&s;tory of Ireland, or Wales, in a total igno|rance of the Iri&s;h and Welch languages, there would be room for as much laughter, and utter deri&s;ion, as if one &s;hould attempt to paint without colours, or to build without materials. But as i am only occupied with the hi&s;tory of Scotland, of which there is not one monument in the Celtic tongues<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Duan in the Appendix to this volume only concerns the Dalriads, who&s;e hi&s;tory is not that of Scotland any more than the hi&s;tory of Wales, is that of England.</NOTE>, it is hoped laborious peru&s;al of the Iri&s;h writers in Latin or Engli&s;h will, in this in&s;tance, atone for my ignorance of the Celtic.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="9" MS="y">It is well known that the hi&s;tory of Ireland has, like that of Scotland, had a &s;ingular fate. While the hi&s;tory and antiquities of Scotland have been, for five centuries, a field of the blacke&s;t forgery, fal&s;ification, and perver&s;ion of all autho|rities, tho&s;e of Ireland have afforded a &s;cene as deplorable, tho not &s;o dete&s;table, of folly and credulity. The conte&s;t between the Iri&s;h antiqua|ries, who were right, and the Scoti&s;h, who were wrong, became unequal, by the natural preponde|rance of cunning over weakne&s;s. The fables, gro&s;s beyond tho&s;e of childhood or anility, and di&s;graceful to the very name of human rea&s;on, which &s;tained the page of Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, now be|gin &s;lowly to vani&s;h. According to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Antiquities in Ireland, there remain only three additional fables to be thrown a&s;ide.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That concerning the Fir-bolg.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Tuath de Danan.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Mile&s;ians.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Tho&s;e abandoned to utter oblivion precede the&s;e three in antiquity; and are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The three daughters of Cain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Cae&s;ara, Noah's niece.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Partholanus.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The race of Nemedius.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Let us examine the three remaining fables; yes, at the end of the eighteenth century, let us exa|mine fables that would di&s;grace the twelfth; not the dreams of &s;en&s;ible ignorance, but of the mad|ne&s;s of noonday.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Fir bolg.</HI> It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;icken the reader by any detail of the&s;e fables. The Fir-bolg, according to Iri&s;h antiquaries, came to Ire|land about 1500 years before Chri&s;t. The Tuath de Danan about 250 after. The Mile&s;ians about 1000 years before our aera. Simply to enquire how the memory of the&s;e events was pre&s;erved, in an illiterate country, is a &s;ufficient confutation of tho&s;e childi&s;h fables. He who believes them is incapable of rea&s;on, or conviction. It would therefore be labour lo&s;t to confute ab&s;urdity; for
<PB N="6" REF="10" MS="y">the fooli&s;h cannot be convinced; and tho&s;e indued with the &s;malle&s;t portion of common &s;en&s;e would only have recour&s;e to laughter.</P>
<P>In this fable the name alone is ju&s;t; for it is now allowed that the Fir-Bolg were the Belgae, placed by Ptolemy, the geographer, in the South of Ire|land. But the&s;e Belgae, as appears by the Di&s;&s;er|tation annexed, could not be there till about 300 years before Chri&s;t, &s;o that the reality of the name, as pre&s;erved in Iri&s;h tradition, palliates not the fable; which ought to be wholly &s;et a&s;ide, e&s;pe|cially as it precedes the Mile&s;ians, a race entirely and utterly fabulous. It is indeed clear that tho&s;e dreaming compilers, who mention the Fir-bolg and Tuath de Danan, have erred gro&s;&s;ly in placing the Mile&s;ians after them. None of tho&s;e Iri&s;h fablers are older than the <HI>Thirteenth</HI> century, and have altered the real &s;eries of the fables in order to make their favourite Mile&s;ians the la&s;t, and conquerors of all the former. Nennius, who wrote in 858, and u&s;ed the Iri&s;h accounts then exi&s;ting, &s;ays nothing of the Fir-bolg, nor Tuath de Danan; but only tells of the Spani&s;h (or Mile&s;ian) colo|nies as the fir&s;t inhabitants of Ireland<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Nennius knew nothing of Mile&s;ius, but only mentions <HI>Miles quidam Hi&s;panus,</HI> a certain Spani&s;h <HI>&s;oldier.</HI> Of this <HI>Miles</HI> the Iri&s;h made Mile&s;ius; as of Julius Cae&s;ar they made Cae&s;ara Noah's niece!</NOTE>. So al&s;o Giraldus Cambren&s;is, who wrote about 1170. The P&s;alter of Ca&s;hel, which &s;eems the very fountain of the&s;e vi&s;ions, is by &s;ome Iri&s;h antiqua|ries &s;aid to have been written by Cormac, king of Ireland, about the year 260. Others a&s;cribe it to a Cormac king and bi&s;hop of Ca&s;hel, about the year 900. Mageogaghan, who details a long account of the matter, gives it to king Brian Borowe's time, about the year 1008. I have redd many quota|tions and extracts from it, and it &s;eems a collec|tion of poetical romances on Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, compiled
<PB N="7" REF="11">in the Thirteenth century, at the earlie&s;t, and kept and found at Ca&s;hel, whence the name.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Tuath de Danan.</HI> That a great part of the Damnii fled from North Britain into Ireland, before the Piki&s;h pre&s;&s;ure, has already been &s;hewn to be highly probable. But this event could not happen above 200 years before our aera; whereas the&s;e Tuath de Danan are placed about 1250 years before Chri&s;t. The name, as with the Fir-bolg, &s;eems genuine, and traditional: but the Iri&s;h ac|count of this colony of magicians, for &s;uch they are repre&s;ented, is ridiculou&s;ly fal&s;e. All the Iri&s;h accounts agree that the Tuath de Danan went from North Britain to Ireland; but repre&s;ent them as before that, re&s;iding in Denmark, and practi&s;ing magic.</P>
<P>An ingenious Iri&s;h author, who is writing an hi&s;tory of Ireland, and who&s;e judgment de&s;pi&s;es what even fancy cannot believe, is inclined to think that the Tuath de Danan were the Danes. Certain it is that Danan was, and is, the Iri&s;h for a Dane. But it is al&s;o certain that the name of Dane was unknown till the Sixth century, when Jornan|des and Procopius fir&s;t mention it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jornandes wrote about 530, Procopius about 560 Gre|gory of Tours, who wrote about 591, mentions the Danes under the year 515, 'Dani cum rege &s;uo Chlochilaicho,' as ravaging Gaul.</NOTE>. The Dani&s;h writers allow it not to have been the ancient name, but to have proceeded from a king called Dan, or from <HI>Daun,</HI> our <HI>down,</HI> 'Low country,' as Den|mark is to Scandinavia. And from a complete &s;eries of writers, and geographers in particular, it is perfectly known that the name was not exi&s;tent till the Sixth century. Like the name of Saxons, Franks, Alamans, Slavons, it &s;eems to have ari&s;en at a late period, from &s;ome adventitious circum|&s;tance. That no Scandinavians nor Danes pro|ceeded to Ireland till the end of the eighth century, &s;hall be pre&s;ently argued. Had the Tuath de
<PB N="8" REF="12" MS="y">Danan been Danes, how came they to be totally unmentioned in the Annals of Ul&s;ter, or more an|cient writers, till the Eighth century? To them who know the nature of tradition, and of Celtic tradition in particular, it will not indeed be &s;ur|prizing that ignorant bards of the Twelfth and Thirteenth centuries &s;hould confound all chrono|logy, &s;o far as to make the Danes, who arrived in Ireland in the Eighth century, &s;ettle there more than a thou&s;and years before Chri&s;t. In this view, but in no other, the Tuath de Danan may be the Danes. But as the Mile&s;ian frenzies follow the&s;e Tuath de Danan, there is no rea&s;on to di&s;crimi|nate them, or the Fir-bolg, from the ma&s;s of fable, merely becau&s;e the names may be real and traditional, while that of Mile&s;ians confe&s;&s;edly is not. If the Iri&s;h antiquaries, as they have from the beginning daily changed their ground, will change it once more, and put the Mile&s;ians fir&s;t, and the Fir-bolg and Tuath de Danan after, &s;ome plau&s;ible di&s;cu&s;&s;ion might follow. But as the ca&s;e &s;tands, the Firbolg, Tuath de Danan, and Mile|&s;ians, form one lump of fiction.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Mile&s;ians.</HI> This fabulous progeny, ac|cording to Iri&s;h accounts, after many adventures in Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa, arrived in Spain, and from thence came to Ireland, about 1000 years before Chri&s;t. There &s;ubduing the Tuath de Danan, they founded a great and powerful kingdom, flouri&s;hing in literature, arts, and arms, but, by a &s;ingular fate, unknown and invi&s;ible to other nations. The kings and leading people of Ireland were all, in the di&s;ea&s;ed imagination of later bards and antiqui&s;ts, de&s;cended from the Mile&s;ian &s;tock; and hence of cour&s;e the chief fables of Iri&s;h antiquity re&s;t upon it. The Fir-bolg, and Tuath de Danan, are regarded as foreigners; and the Mile&s;ians as the ance&s;tors of the Iri&s;h nation.</P>
<P>As this Mile&s;ian Tale is the grand object of religi|ous faith, and reverent re&s;earch, among the Iri&s;h an|tiquaries;
<PB N="9" REF="13">and of eternal laughter, and utter &s;corn, among tho&s;e of all other countries; it is hoped that a &s;hort acount of it will not be unacceptable. There are two <HI>&s;y&s;tems</HI> of this deplorable piece of ab&s;urdity: that of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> authors, and that of the <HI>Scoti&s;h.</HI> The later, as Father Innes &s;hews at great length, is by far the more rational of the two; and is al&s;o the mo&s;t pure and ancient, being in con&s;onance with Nennius, and other early wri|ters, while the Iri&s;h is perverted and corrupt, and more fooli&s;h than folly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> &s;tory is briefly this. Fenius Far&s;a was great grand&s;on to Japhet, one of Noah's &s;ons. Far&s;a's &s;on Niul, came from Scythia to Greece. Niul's &s;on GATHELUS went to Egypt; and thence to Spain, where he founded a kingdom, which there la&s;ted for thirteen generations before MILE|SIUS, This Mile&s;ius went to Scythia, where he &s;erved under king Re&s;loir: thence to Egypt, where he married SCOTA the daughter of Pharaoh, and carried her to Spain. HEREMON, elde&s;t &s;on of Mile&s;ius, led the Mile&s;ians to Ireland, and founded his kingdom there about 1000 years before Chri&s;t. From him the catalogue of Iri&s;h kings is drawn in con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. HIBER the brother of Here|mon al&s;o attended him, and had the North of Ire|land.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> account, as given by Fordun, Win|ton, Boyce, &amp;c. runs thus. Niul, the twentieth from Japhet, went from Scythia to Greece. GA|THELUS, Niul's &s;on, went to Egypt, where he married SCOTA, the daughter of Pharaoh; and, after the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea, he proceeded to Spain, and founded a kingdom. EBER, the &s;on of Gathelus, di&s;covered Ireland, and called it Scotia, in honour of his mother; and it was al&s;o called Hibernia from the di&s;coverer. But he founded no kingdom there, returning immediately to Spain. MILESIUS, whom the blundering tran&s;cribers of Fordun call <HI>Micelius,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="14" MS="y">Winton, <HI>Milet,</HI> was the thirteenth from Gathelus, and reigned in Spain. Heremon, Partholm, and Hybert, &s;ons of Mile&s;ius, led a colony to Spain; and the two la&s;t remained there, but a&s;&s;umed no kingly title. Heremon returned to Spain, where he &s;ucceeded his father. Winton makes no men|tion of any colony being led by the &s;ons of Mile&s;ius; but puts him barely in the li&s;t of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Gathelus. The &s;eventeenth in a right line from Mi|le&s;ius was the famous SIMON BREC; who, by the Scoti&s;h tale, brought the noted &s;tone from Spain to Ireland; and founded the monarchy there. Winton &s;ays that Fergus, &s;on of Erc, who brought the &s;tone to Scotland, and founded the Scoti&s;h monarchy, was in the Fiftieth and Fifth degree of de&s;cendance from Simon Brec. With this illu&s;tri|ous founder of the Iri&s;h monarchy, according to the Scoti&s;h account, <HI>Old Sir Simon the King,</HI> the later Iri&s;h antiquaries are &s;o angry, that, to prevent the Scoti&s;h tale from prejudicing Heremon, they have &s;ome of them hanged Simon Brec, and others have torn him in pieces, for &s;ome pretended crime, of which they cannot at this day produce any evi|dence. As a Scoti&s;hman, i mu&s;t loudly, in the name of my country, prote&s;t again&s;t this gro&s;s in|ju&s;tice, of hanging a man without hearing his de|fence: and wonder that Mr. Goodal, or &s;ome &s;uch zealous Scoti&s;h author, has not written "A Defence of Simon Brec, alias Old Sir Simon the King, again&s;t the bloody, atrocious, and crying &s;laughter, committed on him after he was dead, by certain Iri&s;h antiquaries: with &s;ome reflections from the book called God's revenge again&s;t mur|der."</P>
<P>But to be &s;erious if po&s;&s;ible. The Scoti&s;h ac|count is more coherent and plau&s;ible than the Iri&s;h, as Father Innes &s;hews at great length. To add to the ab&s;urdity of the later Donald O'Neal, king of Ul&s;ter, in his letter to Pope John XXII. in the year 1317, informs the Pontif, that it was
<PB N="11" REF="15" MS="y">then about 3500 years &s;ince the three &s;ons of Mile|&s;ius &s;ettled in Spain: that is, they were there about 2200 years before Chri&s;t's birth. But the grand and radical difference, between the Iri&s;h and Scoti&s;h account<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is that the former commences the Mile|&s;ian monarchy with HERE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ON the elde&s;t &s;on of Mile&s;ius, and, as &s;tated by O'Flaherty, about 1000 years before Chri&s;t: whereas the Scoti&s;h relation begins that monarchy in the per&s;on of SIMON BREC, the &s;ixteenth in degree from Heremon, and yet about 1200 years before Chri&s;t. By the old genea|logy there are fifty-eight generations, from Simon Brec, down to Fergus, &s;on of Erc; tho Winton makes but fifty-five. Of the&s;e generations there are twenty-four from Simon to Forgo, the mock Fergus I. of Scoti&s;h dreamers: and thirty-four from Forgo to Fergus, &s;on of Erc. Allowing 30 years, as u&s;ual, to each generation, fifty-eight generations extend to 1740 years. Twenty-four generations make 720 years from Simon to Forgo; and thirty-four make 1020 from Forgo to Fergus, &s;on of Erc. Fergus, &s;on of Erc, a&s;cended the Scoti&s;h throne about 503 years after Chri&s;t; and of cour&s;e, by the Scoti&s;h account, Simon Brec lived about 1200 years before Chri&s;t: and Forgo about 500, in&s;tead of 330, as Fordun, Boyce, Bucha|nan date him, merely to make him cotemporary with Alexander the Great.</P>
<P>Such are the two Mile&s;ian &s;y&s;tems, that of the Scoti&s;h, and that of the Iri&s;h writers. Since the Sixteenth century the Scoti&s;h authors have totally dropt it on their part; or mentioned it merely as a weak fable. But the Iri&s;h writers per&s;i&s;t in it to this hour; and regard tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e it as ene|mies of their nation, and invidious of it's honour! Deluded madmen! they are them&s;elves the wor&s;t enemies of their country; and the real and unmer|ciful de&s;troyers of it's honour, of it's character among all nations. For from the writers of any country, a judgment is often ra&s;hly formed con|cerning
<PB N="12" REF="16" MS="y">the knowlege and wi&s;dom of the country at large. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e no error can be greater: as, out of two millions in Ireland, not a thou&s;and have even heard of tho&s;e lamentable delu&s;ions; and of that thou&s;and, nine hundred utterly de&s;pi&s;e them. True it is, that the crazy and mercenary bards and &s;ennachies thought to get money, and favour, by giving genealogies of their patrons, carried up to Heremon and Mile&s;ius, nay to Adam, and far beyond. And the Iri&s;h antiqui&s;ts, as O'Connor the tran&s;lator of Keating and others, the true heirs of the madne&s;s of the &s;ennachies, and in fact, mere modern &s;ennachies, attempt to continue the impo&s;ture, by tracing all the chief families of Ireland up to Mile&s;ius, in order by this pitiful trick, to engage them all under the banners of folly. But the&s;e families having &s;olid claims of re&s;pect, do generally contemn the&s;e poor delu&s;ions; and are content, as other noble families of Europe, to clo&s;e the genealogy at the fir&s;t &s;hade of uncertainty; for fal&s;ehood, far from adding honour, is infa|mous in it&s;elf, and can only bring infamy and de|ri&s;ion. Men of reading are in their clo&s;ets, apt to dream of opinions being national, which are in fact confined to a few vi&s;ionaries. Antiquarian matters are, as i humbly conceive, never national; as there are &s;eldom above a dozen antiquaries in a nation; and in the Briti&s;h empire, where alone antiquary and vi&s;ionary are &s;ynonymous, the nation only laughs at it's antiquaries. On the continent indeed, where an antiquary is a &s;acred and mo&s;t important cha|racter, that of a man of profound and &s;olid learning, who confers honour on his country by a mo&s;t labo|rious re&s;earch into it's genuine antiquities, and intro|ducing them to the mo&s;t rigorous di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the whole republic of letters, the highe&s;t re&s;pect is paid to antiquaries; and their province is ju&s;tly regarded, as by far the mo&s;t difficult, and, of cour&s;e, the mo&s;t honourable in the whole circle of &s;cience. But even there, antiquarian matters are not na|tional:
<PB N="13" REF="17">but only known to the thinking and learned few. It is therefore merely the vanity of authors that dreams of nations being intere&s;ted in &s;upport of their opinions; while not above one in ten thou&s;and of the nation has ever heard any thing of the matter. With the&s;e views, tho i have the mo&s;t &s;incere re&s;pect for the Iri&s;h nation, yet i &s;cruple not to hold to due contempt the Iri&s;h &s;ennachies and modern antiqui&s;ts, which la&s;t would be called children, and not antiquaries, on the continent: and believe that every &s;en&s;ible native of Ireland will &s;ee, that to expo&s;e the ab|&s;urd enemies of the true honour of that country, is to do a &s;ervice to its cau&s;e. For, if i am rightly informed, in Ireland, as here, and in the re&s;t of Europe, the very name of Mile&s;ians is a je&s;t; and the acceptance of any part of the fable is e&s;teemed an infallible criterion of an in&s;ane writer. Indeed as there is no credit due to any account of Iri&s;h kings, or their actions, preceding the Chri&s;tian aera, the very mark A. M. or <HI>Anno Mundi</HI> in Iri&s;h affairs, is well interpreted <HI>A&s;inaria Maxima</HI> by fo|reigners, and affords perpetual laughter.</P>
<P>The&s;e fables &s;hall be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a remark or two, naturally ari&s;ing from the &s;ubject. The whole tale of the Mile&s;ians, and the hi&s;tory of the monarchs of that mock line, preceding our aera, or for a thou&s;and years, is the mo&s;t deplorable piece of non&s;en&s;e, that ever &s;tained the annals of mankind. The fables of the other Grand Celtic race, the Welch, as delivered to us by the de|&s;ervedly infamous Geoffrey of Monmouth, and de|duced from Brutus, great grand &s;on of Eneas, who, as they tell, came to Britain about 1000 years before Chri&s;t, are &s;ober and &s;apient, com|pared to the Iri&s;h fictions. In the page of Geof|frey of Monmouth may be found an Imogen, a Locrine, and Guendolen, with their daughter Sabra; a Bladud; a Lear, and his daughters; a Gordobuc; a Belinus; a Lud; an Arthur; all
<PB N="14" REF="18" MS="y">non-exi&s;tences, yet well known in the regions of poetry and romance. But the whole Iri&s;h hi&s;toric fictions are not only beneath contempt, as hi&s;tory; but beneath contempt, as fictions. To read them is to be condemned to a di&s;gu&s;t, and pity, the &s;ame with that ari&s;ing from the conver&s;ation of a mere idiot. Zealous as i am for what little truth can be found in hi&s;tory, were i a native of Ireland, and could evidence the veracity of the&s;e tales to all Europe by irrefragable proofs, i would give my vote for their being left in utter oblivion, le&s;t they &s;hould di&s;honour my country. De&s;titute of the &s;malle&s;t charm of fiction, they are not only lies, but di&s;gu&s;ting and nau&s;eous lies. Boyce, Bucha|nan, and the other Scoti&s;h forgers, made their fic|tions le&s;&s;ons to monarchs; and it is to their fal&s;e|hoods that we owe the death of Charles I. and ab|dication of James II<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>See Nicol&s;on's Scoti&s;h Hi&s;t.

The tales of the Welch and Scoti&s;h forgers had an influence on the whole hi&s;|tory of Europe: tho&s;e of the Iri&s;h never had nor can have any effect, being wholly contemptible even to imagination. Bi&s;hop Nicol&s;on, in his Iri&s;h hi&s;torical library, has mo&s;t facetiou&s;ly at|tempted to bring the Iri&s;h fables into a &s;imilar point of view with the I&s;landic. On the very plan he has followed, a compari&s;on might al&s;o be drawn of the Hottentot traditions with the Gothic: and he &s;eems totally to have forgot that the power of the human mind is no where better di&s;tingui&s;hed than in fiction, it's own creation.

<PB N="15" REF="19" MS="y">all. The Iri&s;h legends are in all points the re|ver&s;e. The Mile&s;ian fable is connected with Pha|raoh; and bears other palpable marks of being in|vented long after Chri&s;tianity was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Ireland. Odin was the god of war; and can be traced in mo&s;t writers of the middle ages, long before the Icelandic monuments were written. Snorro, who wrote in the thirteenth century, places the arrival of Odin in Scandinavia, about &s;eventy years before Chri&s;t<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Edda, apud Torf. Ser. Reg. Dan. Mallet has adopted this puerile opinion.</NOTE>. Donald O'Neal, in the fourteenth, placed the arrival of the &s;ons of Mile|&s;ius, who were never heard of before, about 2200 years before Chri&s;t! Beda, who wrote in 731, mentions Odin; but, tho intimate with many of the mo&s;t learned men of Ireland, had never heard a &s;yllable of the Mile&s;ian tales, but puts Ireland as the <HI>patria,</HI> or fir&s;t habitation of the Scots. Let any one read the Northern &s;agas, and he will find manly judgment, and fine imagination, while the Iri&s;h tales are quite de&s;titute of the&s;e quali|ties. The Scandinavians we know had letters, and yet their antiquaries build not on this: the Iri&s;h we know had none, till converted by Patrick, and yet their writers are forced, as one ab&s;urdity includes another, to build their fairy man&s;ion upon the u&s;e of letters, among a people marked by the Greek and Roman writers as utterly &s;avage. Bi|&s;hip Nicol&s;on's parallel only &s;hews the infallibility of the axiom that fancy will find re&s;emblances any where; while to di&s;criminate is the peculiar pro|vince of judgment. Others have &s;aid that there are fables in early Greek and Roman hi&s;tory, and why not allow the Iri&s;h to pa&s;s as &s;uch? With all my heart; but ob&s;erve at the &s;ame time that the Greek and Roman fables vary a little from the Iri&s;h; the former being produced by great and able writers, and de&s;ervedly admired for many
<PB N="16" REF="20" MS="y">centuries; the later the weak effu&s;ions of &s;illy &s;en|nachies, and only fit for the flames. The argu|ment is mode&s;t and Celtic; but there is, as is generally believed, a difference in fable; &s;ome &s;light &s;hade of di&s;&s;onance between the hi&s;tory of Tom Jones, and that of Tom Thumb. There are al&s;o degrees in non&s;en&s;e; &s;ome non&s;en&s;e is ri&s;ible; other non&s;en&s;e, as the old Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, is &s;uper-&s;uperlative, and extra-&s;oporific. As hi&s;tory or as fiction, it is equally ab&s;urd. Allegory is the la&s;t apology for non&s;en&s;e<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Late writers have attempted to compare Iri&s;h names and hi&s;tory, with tho&s;e of Egypt, Armenia, Otaheite, &amp;c. but not to &s;peak of their gro&s;s mi&s;quotations and mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions. the &s;ame frantic fancy might find re&s;emblance in any objects whatever. In the mental, as in the natural night, all objects are confounded. To &s;hew the Chine&s;e hi&s;tory the &s;ame with the Dutch, in names and events, would only require one quality in any writer, a di&s;ordered imagination.</P></NOTE>; but even John Bunyan could not allegorize Mile&s;ian hi&s;tory. Late Iri&s;h writers &s;ay, that Fenius Far&s;a was a name for the Phenicians; Simon Brec for Samp&s;on, who broke the heads of the Phili&s;tines, &amp;c. There is one in|famy yet greater than telling a lye, and that is, to make an apology for that lye. The more plau&s;ible the apology is, it is the more &s;candalous. So much the better, &s;o much the wor&s;e. For to im|po&s;e on &s;ociety is one crime; but to colour that impo&s;ition afre&s;h, and to dre&s;s fal&s;ehood in the holy robes of truth, is a far greater crime. No modi|fication, or apology of any kind, can be accepted. The point is utterly to give up the&s;e abominable fables; and till this be done, the Iri&s;h antiquaries will have them all to them&s;elves, without one rival. For how can the literati of Europe conver&s;e with tho&s;e who give evident &s;igns of madne&s;s, of a mad|ne&s;s unknown to any other nation?</P>
<P>Before proceeding to con&s;ider the real and genuine origins of Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, it becomes nece&s;|&s;ary to notice the claim, which &s;ome Iri&s;h anti|quaries pretend their country has to the u&s;e of letters
<PB N="17" REF="21">before Chri&s;tianity was planted there. Keating tells that Fenius Far&s;a great grand&s;on of Ja|phet, and ance&s;tor of the Mile&s;ians, &s;et up a &s;chool of learning in the plains of Senaar, about one hundred and fifty years after the deluge; and invented Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Iri&s;h, characters. The&s;e earlie&s;t Iri&s;h characters were the <HI>Beth-luis-nion</HI> and <HI>Ogum,</HI> according to Toland, who gravely relates this childi&s;h lye as matter of fact. Charles the Second &s;aid of I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius, that he believed every thing but the &s;cripture; and this character is ju&s;tly applicable to Toland, who&s;e incredulity mu&s;t have been the fruit of vain glory, and not of &s;trength of mind. For there is nothing in &s;cripture &s;o ab&s;urd as this: and he who believed this &s;hould have boggled at nothing. The mind of Toland mu&s;t, like that of I&s;aac Vo&s;|&s;ius, have been very ill poi&s;ed; and in&s;tead of calling &s;uch men philo&s;ophers, it can only be &s;aid that they were fools, who believed, or di&s;believed; as the whim led them. For &s;ound rea&s;on knows no prejudices; but weighs every thing in the &s;ame &s;cales. The Iri&s;h hi&s;tory al&s;o bears, that king Tigermna, and after him Eocha Ollam-fodla; about 800 years before Chri&s;t, gave great en|couragement to learning, ordered annals to be di|ge&s;ted, &amp;c. By &s;uch gro&s;s fal&s;ehoods, a&s;&s;erted at random, would the&s;e Iri&s;h antiqui&s;ts per&s;uade the literati of Europe to believe impo&s;&s;ibilities! Who can confute &s;uch non&s;en&s;e? and who will li&s;ten to the confutation?</P>
<P>The old characters, which the Iri&s;h pretend to, are the <HI>Beth-luis-nion,</HI> the different kinds of <HI>Ogum, Bebeloth,</HI> &amp;c. The Beth-luis-nion is the common Saxon, or lower Roman alphabet, changed in the order of letters, by the whim of the &s;ennachies. The different kinds of Ogum are merely &s;orts of &s;hort-hand-writing, u&s;ed in the middle ages. The Bebeloth is another contracted mode of writing, well known to the learned by the name of <HI>Notae Longobardicoe.</HI> The Hel&s;ing Runes,
<PB N="18" REF="22">con&s;i&s;ting of conic marks, variou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, have al&s;o, i believe, been found in Ireland, &s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in part by the Danes; and have, as u&s;ual, been regarded as letters older than chri&s;tianity, while they were u&s;ed in Denmark in the Twelfth century. It is in vain to &s;trive, not only with folly, but with utter ignorance. If tho&s;e Iri&s;h antiqui&s;ts will &s;tudy the antiquities of Europe, and compare them with their own, they may acquire &s;obriety. As it is, when an U&s;her, or a Ware, ari&s;es in Ireland, they regard tho&s;e matters as mere dreams; and pa&s;s at once to the time when chri&s;|tianity and letters fir&s;t appeared in Ireland. The cau&s;e of folly is only &s;upported by ignorance; and no writer cares to an&s;wer what all know to be puerile. The conte&s;t between tho&s;e Iri&s;h writers, and the literati of all Europe, is the mo&s;t ri&s;ible in the world. The former &s;ay, their country was highly civilized, had letters and academies, as the Greeks and Romans. The latter &s;ay, the Greeks we know, and the Romans we know, but who are ye? Tho&s;e Greeks and Romans pronounce you not only barbarous, but utterly &s;avage. Where are your authorities again&s;t this? In the name of that degree of rationality, which even &s;ome bea&s;ts have, where are the &s;lighte&s;t marks of ancient civi|lization among you? Where are ruins of cities? Where in&s;criptions? Where ancient coins? Where is the lea&s;t trace of ancient art or &s;cience in your whole iland? The old inhabitants of your country, the Wild Iri&s;h, the true Mile&s;ian breed, untainted with Gothic blood, we know to be utter &s;avages at this day. Can a nation, once civilized, ever become &s;avage? Impo&s;&s;ible! Such a nation may be lo&s;t in effeminacy, as the modern Italians and Greeks; but will ever bear marks of the ex|ce&s;s, not the want, of civilization.</P>
<P>Father Innes has at great length examined, and completely confuted, the Iri&s;h claim to letters, be|fore St. Patrick introduced them, along with chri&s;|tianity,
<PB N="19" REF="23">about the year 440. That the Iri&s;h had letters &s;o early, and many writers &s;oon after, is &s;urely enough; and more than &s;everal great na|tions of Europe can pretend to. The Germans, Scandinavians, Polanders, Ru&s;&s;ians, have by no means &s;uch early claim; but &s;tand later by near four centuries. In the name of heaven, what would tho&s;e Celtic gentry have? But, like the dog in the fable, by gra&s;ping at the &s;hadow, they lo&s;e the &s;ub&s;tance; and the fictions of early Iri&s;h hi&s;|tory bring contempt upon the whole. From &s;uch friends and a&s;&s;ertors, may heaven defend my country! We are told of many ab&s;tract terms in the old Iri&s;h language, as a proof that the people were civilized. Yet no &s;uch terms are produced, and, if they were, how old are they? The u&s;e of Latin ab&s;tract terms is quite modern In the old German, Anglo-belgic, &amp;c. the ab&s;tract terms are peculiar to the &s;peech, as <HI>godhede</HI> for <HI>deity,</HI> &amp;c. There is not one Iri&s;h manu&s;cript extant, older than the Eleventh century, long after metaphy&s;ics, and other non&s;en&s;ical learning, had been &s;ucce&s;s|fully &s;tudied there. What wonder then at ab&s;tract terms? The Iri&s;h antiqui&s;ts, as i have found from experience, are &s;o ignorant, as not to know a MS. of the Fourteenth century; but will repeatedly call &s;uch a one of the Third, Fourth, or Fifth, as they plea&s;e to bapti&s;e it. They do not know what is known to all; yet pretend to know what is un|known to all. Vague references to MSS. of vague antiquity form the main chicane of Iri&s;h authors; who are &s;o &s;tupid, as not to di&s;cern that this is never allowed in &s;uch que&s;tions; but that if a MS. be quoted, it's age, place where kept, page, and column, are always accurately marked by the antiquaries of all other countries, and the words them&s;elves always produced, with a literal tran&s;la|tion. But the Iri&s;h MSS. are a&s;hamed of the light; and it is no wonder that they &s;hun it. Of Ice|landic MSS. we have above Five Hundred now in
<PB N="20" REF="24" MS="y">print. Of Iri&s;h not one. The con&s;equence is, that the language cannot be &s;tudied, and is but imperfectly known, even to tho&s;e Iri&s;h writers, who u&s;e the&s;e MSS. as is clear from the various and vague interpretation, given by different Iri&s;h writers, of one and the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age. They are perpetually accu&s;ing each other of not under&s;tand|ing the tongue; and i do believe they are all in the right. Were the MSS. publi&s;hed, the language would be &s;tudied by different literati; and it's principles and vocabulary fully &s;ettled. At pre&s;ent who will &s;tudy a language, in which there is not one book publi&s;hed?</P>
<P>Having thus, with as much patience as po&s;&s;ible, mentioned the fabulous origins of Ireland, it re|mains to illu&s;trate the truth of this &s;ubject. As there is not one Iri&s;h manu&s;cript, at all mentioning the&s;e origins, which is older than the Thirteenth century, it is clear that no information can be ex|pected from Iri&s;h MSS. upon this matter; and that, far from throwing the lea&s;t ray of light upon it, they only darken it with the thicke&s;t clouds of ig|norance and folly. In judging of Iri&s;h origins therefor, as in tho&s;e of other European nations, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to the only genuine fountains of light, the Roman writers.</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally known, that the Wild Iri&s;h, re|mains of the old inhabitants, call them&s;elves Gael, and their language Gaelic, and that they are Celts from Gaul. Much labour has been wa&s;ted in at|tempting to &s;hew that they mu&s;t have pa&s;t from Britain, the neare&s;t &s;hore. To me it is apparent, that they actually pa&s;&s;ed from the North-we&s;t of Gaul to Ireland; tho great numbers might join them from Britain. The manner in which pro|found &s;cholars treat human affairs is often highly ri&s;ible. They judge of them upon mechanical principles! A &s;en&s;ible French writer has ruined a learned di&s;&s;ertation, by &s;uppo&s;ing that barbaric nations have no navigation, but always proceed
<PB N="21" REF="25">by land! Tacitus more wi&s;ely thought there could be no progre&s;s but by &s;ea! But both were wrong, for want of one &s;imple reflection, namely that even &s;avages have generally hands as well as feet. No &s;avages have yet been di&s;covered over the whole globe, who had no navigation. From the North Pole to the South Pole, where there were men, there were canoes. The invention, if it may be &s;o called, is &s;o utterly &s;imple, that every untaught infant throws his cork upon the water; and, if he had a cork large enough, would jump on it, to have a &s;ail him&s;elf. If we except eating and drinking, there is certainly no art &s;o primitive as rude navigation. Where cloths are not invented, where huts are not invented, &s;till there are canoes. And, from the late di&s;coveries in the South Sea, we know, that even the rude&s;t &s;avages will venture on a voyage, at open &s;ea, of four or five hundred miles, or more. Let us therefore judge of human affairs, not by mechanical learning, but by com|mon &s;en&s;e; and allow, for in&s;tance, that it is quite uncertain whether Ireland or Britain was fir&s;t peopled from Gaul. The pa&s;&s;age over the &s;traits of Dover is Twenty-four miles: that from the North-we&s;t of Gaul to Ireland is about Two Hun|dred. The probability is certainly that Britain was fir&s;t peopled; but it by no means follows that Ireland mu&s;t have been peopled from Britain. For the va&s;t fore&s;ts of Britain, and three hundred miles of breadth, were far more difficult to pa&s;s, than two hundred miles of open &s;ea, which a fleet of &s;avages, in canoes, might pa&s;s on a &s;ummer day. The &s;ea, as now perfectly known, far from &s;eparating nations, is the grand mean of comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|nication between them. It is land, and not &s;ea, that is difficult for civilized nations, as for &s;avages, to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>That the old Iri&s;h did not originate from Spain, can never be argued from the di&s;tance, which is but four hundred miles of open &s;ea: but from
<PB N="22" REF="26" MS="y">other urgent rea&s;ons. I once inclined to think that they did originate from Spain; chiefly be|cau&s;e Tacitus thought the Silures, who were in that part of Britain oppo&s;ite to Ireland, a Spani&s;h colony: and becau&s;e he mentions that the ports of Ireland were, in his time, more frequented than tho&s;e of Britain. Other rea&s;ons al&s;o concurred. For it might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, as the Celts held Germany and Gaul, &s;o they al&s;o po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed Spain, before the Iberi came over from Africa and expelled them. That the Iri&s;h were not Iberi, is certain from their &s;peech, which is Celtic, not Iberian, or Cantabric. If they came from Spain, they mu&s;t therefore have been Celts from Spain. And it was highly plau&s;ible to &s;up|po&s;e that the Iberi drove the Celts out of Spain, on the Ea&s;t, over the Pyrenees; but that, on the we&s;t, the Celts were confined between the Iberi and the &s;ea, and had no recour&s;e but to e&s;cape by &s;ea: and that, as all the coa&s;t of Gaul and Britain was filled with their Celtic brethren, they would naturally pa&s;s to the neare&s;t uninhabited land, which was Ireland. Facts al&s;o &s;eemed to corrobo|rate this theory. We find may Celtic nations in the North of Spain, as de&s;cribed by ancient writers. The Verones, a people of pre&s;ent Bi&s;cay, were Celts, as Strabo tells, <HI>lib.</HI> III. p. 245. In A&s;turia there were al&s;o Celts, as Pliny informs us, <HI>lib.</HI> III. <HI>cap.</HI> 3. But above all, and what was mo&s;t to the purpo&s;e, in Gallicia, that very point of Spain which fronts Ireland, and to which it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the Celts would be driven, the an|cients actually place Celts. Cape Fini&s;terre was called <HI>Promontorium Gelticum,</HI> not Ibericum, by the ancients; and Pliny de&s;cribing the nations around it, or in Gallicia, puts <HI>Celtici cognomine Nerioe,</HI> and <HI>Celtici cognomine Proe&s;amarci,</HI> lib. IV. c. 20. Strabo al&s;o, <HI>lib.</HI> III. p. 230, tells, that the region around this promontory was inhabited by Celts. And there is every rea&s;on to believe
<PB N="23" REF="27" MS="y">that the Gallaeci, who are here placed by Pliny, and other ancients, and who gave name to pre&s;ent Gallicia, were Gauls, and bore the Gallic name accordingly. In this &s;cheme of Iri&s;h origins i much exulted; as it would give me no &s;mall plea&s;ure to &s;upport the Iri&s;h antiquaries, in their favorite Spani&s;h origin.</P>
<P>But unhappily all this theory was forced to yield to ancient facts. In the di&s;&s;ertation annexed, it is &s;hewn that the Celrici and Celtiberi of Spain were not Celts proper; but German Gauls, who, as new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of Gaul, the ancient domain of the Celts, acquired the name of Celts, as the Engli&s;h in Britain are termed Britons, in America, Americans. Yet the Celtiberi were on the Ea&s;t, and the Celtici on the South of Spain; &s;o that the&s;e northern Celts of Spain might have been re|mains of the old Celts. But the authority of Strabo is direct on the other &s;ide, and admits of no an&s;wer, or palliative. For he &s;hews that both the Verones and the Celts of Gallicia were of the &s;ame race with the Celtici and Celtiberi, that is, German Gauls; and that, far from being old po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the country, they had only gained their territories in the &s;ame late expedition with the Celtiberi and Celtici.

Tho&s;e on the Ana were the Celtici, peculiarly &s;o called; and who are &s;hewn to have been Gothic, or German Gauls, in the annexed Di&s;&s;ertation. Whether they were Celts or Goths is indeed nothing to the purpo&s;e: for it is clear that the&s;e northern Celts of Spain were all of one expedition with the Celtici and Celtiberi; who had lately pa&s;t from Gaul into Spain, as appears from Lucan, Silius Italicus, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Appian. So that they were not ancient inhabitants of the country, but late immigrators from Gaul, who had conquered po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions for them&s;elves from the Iberi. What time this expedition happened is uncertain; but from the &s;trong memory of it, in all the above authors, it was certainly late; and the learned and accurate Schoepflin<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vindiciae Celticae.</NOTE> only &s;ays, that it mu&s;t have hap|pened before the Second Punic War, as Livy, XXII. 21. and Silius Italicus III. 350. mention the Celtiberi as engaged in that war which broke out 216 years before Chri&s;t. It is &s;hewn in the Di&s;&s;ertation, that the Celts proper, or old &s;avages of Gaul, were &s;o far from &s;ending colonies into other countries, that they could not defend their own; and in particular the Iberi gained all Aqui|tania from them; &s;o that their conquering Iberian po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions would have been a phaenomenon indeed. That the Gauls, or Celts, &s;o called, of Gallia Bracata were Gothic, or German Gauls; and that as they lay on the North of Spain, while the other Gauls were at a di&s;tance, there is no room to doubt that they were the Celts, &s;o called, who &s;eized various po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Spain. This further appears from the names of their towns in Spain, of which many begin, or end, with <HI>brig</HI> the German <HI>berg,</HI> or <HI>town,</HI> &s;o u&s;ual at this day. Strabo, lib.

This it does in no Celtic dialect: but in the Gothic it retains that meaning. Among the Celts of the North of Spain we find <HI>Flaviobriga,</HI> (now Bilboa) or Flaviu&s;berg; and <HI>Flavium Bri|gantium,</HI> (Ferrol). But not to re&s;t the argument even upon this truth, it cannot at any rate be ever imagined that the few Celts who migrated from Gaul into the north of Spain, at a late period, could be tho&s;e Celts who peopled Ireland. Ware, and other cool Iri&s;h antiquaries, who argue that the Iri&s;h came from Spain, always conclude them Iberi, the real ancient inhabitants of Spain; and that the name Ibernia &s;prung from the Iberi. But this opinion is wholly untenable, becau&s;e the Iri&s;h language, the Gaelic, is as remote from the Ibe|rian, or Cantabric, as po&s;&s;ible; and is well known to be a grand Celtic dialect. The ancients are totally &s;ilent concerning any Celtic aborigines in Spain; and uniformly regard the Iberi as the mo&s;t ancient inhabitants: &s;o that it is certain that the old Iri&s;h, as Celts proper, could not pa&s;s from Spain, a country never inhabited by Celts proper, but mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed from Gaul, a nearer country, and known to have been originally wholly po&s;&s;e&s;t by Celts proper.</P>
<P>So much for the origin of the Wild Iri&s;h, or true Gaelic Iri&s;h, e&s;teemed by their antiquaries the genuine Mile&s;ian breed. The prevalence of their language is a clear proof that they were al|ways by far the mo&s;t numerous people in Ireland, as they formed the real ancient population of the country, and &s;uch colonies as &s;ettled among them were regarded as aliens. The date of this earlie&s;t population of Ireland it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain; and it may have been a thou&s;and or two thou&s;and years before our aera. It is indeed a matter of &s;upreme indifference at what time the &s;avages of a continent peopled a neighbouring iland.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="30" MS="y">But tho it be thus certain that the Gaelic Iri&s;h, the Iri&s;h peculiarly &s;o called, or Wild Iri&s;h, were Gael, or Celts of Gaul, it remains to enquire if any Iberian colonies &s;ettled among them. For tho the prevalence of the Gaelic tongue &s;hews that the Celts formed the grand population of the country; yet Iberian colonies might arrive, and their own &s;peech be lo&s;t, as u&s;ual, in that of the more numer|ous inhabitants. The whole idea of the popula|tion of Ireland from Spain &s;eems to have ari&s;en from the proximity of the names <HI>Iberni</HI> and <HI>Iberi:</HI> and the ab&s;urd etymologies of I&s;idorus, and other writers of the middle ages, &s;urely led the way to all the dreaming connection between Ibernia and Iberia, between Ireland and Spain. To tho&s;e who know how often great events &s;pring from little cau&s;es, it will not appear wonderful that the prox|imity of the words <HI>Ibernia</HI> and <HI>Iberia</HI> has converted the ancient hi&s;tory of Ireland into a ma&s;s of folly never mentioned but with laughter. What fooli&s;h ideas did not the Iberi of A&s;ia, and tho&s;e of Spain, lead even &s;en&s;ible ancients into! Strabo, and others, thought the former &s;prung from the later: Pliny and others, on the contrary, thought that the Iberi of Spain proceeded from tho&s;e in A&s;ia. Etymology, and approximation of names, one would imagine, were two rocks of Syrens in the ocean of literature, that deprived even &s;en&s;ible writers of common under&s;tanding. For is any matter &s;o &s;im|ple, &s;o univer&s;ally known, as that identic names will happen from mere falls of letters, and from the greate&s;t variety of cau&s;es? Did Pendennis in A&s;ia Minor bear the &s;ame origin as Pendennis in Corn|wall? Cannot a hundred in&s;tances be given of identic names, in languages that have no relation? And in the &s;ame languages, is not the &s;ame word often u&s;ed in various meanings; and the &s;ame name given to nations of quite di&s;tinct origins, becau&s;e it implies &s;ome common quality? I a&s;&s;ent to Pelloutier that the name <HI>Iberi</HI> is from the
<PB N="27" REF="31">Gothic, <HI>Uber,</HI> beyond; but think that the Goths of A&s;ia gave it to their own brethren <HI>Beyond</HI> the mountains, that run between them and the Iberi of A&s;ia; and tho&s;e of Gallia Bracata al&s;o gave the very &s;ame name to quite a different people <HI>Beyond</HI> the Pyrenees. We term the Scoti&s;h high|landers, Mountaineers, and the Swi&s;s Moun|taineers; and if, in the &s;implicity of ancient times, Mountaineers had become a national term, it might have been argued that the Swi&s;s and Highlanders were of one name and origin. No writer of the &s;malle&s;t preten&s;ion to common rationality ever ought to found any thing on etymology or identity of di&s;tant names; and too &s;trong dete&s;tation can|not be expre&s;t again&s;t this childi&s;h frenzy, which has tainted and utterly &s;poilt innumerable works of this century, and corrupted them into ma&s;|&s;es of learned madne&s;s, the di&s;grace, mortifica|tion, and contempt of human rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Roman names of Ireland, <HI>Hibernia, Iverne, Ierne,</HI> are now thought to have &s;prung from the Cumraig, or old Briti&s;h <HI>Yverdon,</HI> or We&s;tern Ile; tho perhaps from the Gothic <HI>Uber-Ey,</HI> or <HI>Iber-Ey,</HI> 'the further iland,' in re&s;pect to Britain. The indigenal name <HI>Erin</HI> has the &s;ame meaning; but the Romans received the name from the Britons. The old etymology of <HI>Iberni</HI> from <HI>Iberi</HI> is accord|ingly now abandoned on all hands. But it de&s;erves notice, that there was a tribe called peculiarly <HI>Iverni,</HI> in the &s;outh of Ireland, as appears from the Palatine MS. which contains the genuine text of Ptolemy, far more free from corruptions than any other. The common editions bear <HI>Uterni;</HI> but that <HI>Iverni</HI> is the genuine reading is clear from the Palatine MS. and from Richard of Ciren|ce&s;ter.

Nor can any Cantabric, or Iberian words be found in the Iri&s;h language; while it abounds with Gothic terms. For the &s;pe|cimen of Lloyd only &s;hews the di&s;&s;imilarity of the very words he chu&s;es; and he might have ea&s;ily found more Engli&s;h words, or German words, with greater re&s;emblance of the Cantabric, than

The Japane&s;e, as has lately been &s;hewn, bears more re&s;emblance to the Iri&s;h, than the Cantabric does; and if one &s;eeks re&s;emblance of &s;ingle words, in this way, one is &s;ure to find them; for it would be a miracle indeed, if out of 60,000 words, all pro|duced by the &s;ame organs, there were not 100 alike, in any two languages whatever <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P>Thus the Tartaric, Chine&s;e, Japane&s;e, Phoenician, A&s;iatic, &amp;c. &amp;c. have been paralleled with the Iri&s;h. The Dutch with the Malayan, Hebrew, &amp;c. The Welch with the Huron. The Engli&s;h with the Peruvian. The Greek with the Chine&s;e. And the rea&s;on of &s;imilar words in all languages is certainly very profound, to wit, that all mankind have the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, and organs of &s;peech. When, in the Di&s;&s;ertation annexed, Language is put as a grand proof of the origin of nations, it is meant, not that 100 words may be the &s;ame, but that 10,000 words, or more, are the &s;ame; and that the idioms, or &s;oul, and grammar, or body, of the language are the &s;ame. A hundred compari&s;ons of languages would be &s;pared, if a complete compari&s;on of all languages were pub|li&s;hed, &s;hewing in particular the difference between accidental re&s;emblances, and tho&s;e &s;hades, which we call dialects, as the Engli&s;h is of the German, the German of the Gothic; the Curlandic of the Poli&s;h, the Poli&s;h of the Slavonic, &amp;c. But it requires great learning and experience even to conceive tho&s;e radical differences, tho va&s;t, which di&s;criminate Grand Languages from each other, as the Gothic from the Slavonic, and the Tartaric: and to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e differences from tho&s;e of mere dialect. As to paralleling a few &s;imilar words, from languages radically different, the mo&s;t ignorant may do it by means of dictionaries; and it is remarkable, that the mo&s;t ignorant writers are the mo&s;t apt to fall into this.</P></NOTE>. It will therefore, upon the whole, not be accounted ra&s;h to &s;ay, that there is not the &s;lighte&s;t proof to be found that any colonies ever came from Spain to Ireland: but that, as &s;uch events always leave traces behind them, and none &s;uch are to be found in ancient writers, nor in the language of the peo|ple, there is firm rea&s;on to infer the contrary.</P>
<P>On the continent, an antiquary is a man, who examines ancient matters upon ancient authorities,
<PB N="31" REF="37" MS="y">and &s;olid rea&s;oning. In Britain an antiquary is a vi&s;ionary, who details &s;uperficial dreams to the public, upon no ancient authority at all, and upon the mo&s;t &s;illy and irrational ratiocination. Hence what no foreign antiquary, what no man of &s;ound learning, would even imagine, has been &s;eriou&s;ly advanced among us lately; to wit, that the Phoe|nicians &s;ettled colonies in the &s;outh of Britain, and in Ireland! That traces of the Phoenician lan|guage may be found in that of the Wild Iri&s;h! Seriou&s;ly this is too bad! this is pu&s;hing learned folly to an extreme degree! Do reflect, &s;weet gentleman dablers, that the Phoenicians were a people equal to the Greeks and Romans in every art, and refinement. That the traces of their colonies in Africa, in Spain, are fixt, and deci|&s;ive; and throw light all around them. That, if they had held even the &s;malle&s;t &s;ettlement in Bri|tain, or Ireland, &s;o &s;triking a circum&s;tance, &s;o di&s;|tingui&s;hed a mark of their extended power and na|vigation, could never have e&s;caped <HI>all</HI> the ancient writers. It is well known that the Phoenicians traded to Britain and Ireland, from their Spani&s;h colonies, perhaps a thou&s;and years before our aera. Strabo tells us, they imported to Britain earthen ve&s;&s;els, &s;alt, iron and copper goods; and exported &s;kins, but above all tin; and Diodorus Siculus informs us that it was the people of Cape Belerium (Cornwall) that digged the tin. From Ireland they could only export &s;kins; certainly a branch of commerce that no nation ever thought of &s;ettling for, when the &s;upply depended on the hunting, &amp;c. of all the inhabitants of the country. Had the Phoenicians &s;ettled in any part of Britain or Ireland, their u&s;ual &s;plendor would have attended them. A few Phoenician coins may perhaps be found in Britain and Ireland, a circum&s;tance na|turally to be expected from their trading there; but, had there been any &s;ettlements, there would have been ruins, and numerous coins &s;truck at the
<PB N="32" REF="38" MS="y">&s;ettlement, as at all tho&s;e in Spain. But not to wa&s;te time in an&s;wering the dreams of folly, the total &s;ilence of all the ancients on this head is a complete negation. The proximity of the Gaelic to the Phoenician is no greater than that of the Gaelic to the Japane&s;e, or to the Shilhic, or to the Malayan, as we now know from &s;pecimens of all. It is perfectly under&s;tood by every man of the lea&s;t reading, that any two given languages will afford &s;uch &s;pecimens. A learned German has &s;hewn, that all tongues whatever have &s;uch re&s;em|blances. It is the grammar, and form, and whole ma&s;s of a language; not a &s;imilarity of a few words, that is the criterion. The Iri&s;h being a language quite in the dark, no wonder that it appears a bear, a tyger, a calf, a lion, a man, a gho&s;t, or what you plea&s;e, in the midnight around it. Let us await with patience till other antiquaries with new whims find Japane&s;e, African, Malayan, Tar|tarian colonies in Ireland; and then the cool reader will an&s;wer them all at once, with the &s;ingle word <HI>non&s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Having now, it is hoped, pa&s;t the mora&s;&s;es of folly, let us proceed on &s;olid ground. The reader has &s;een that the fir&s;t population of Ireland was, in every probability, from Gaul. The Wild Iri&s;h, confe&s;&s;edly the original inhabitants, call them&s;elves Gael, and their &s;peech Gaelic. Cae&s;ar informs us, that <HI>Kelts</HI> was the indigenal name; <HI>Gauls,</HI> a name given by the Romans. It is therefore apparent that the primitive Iri&s;h called them&s;elves Kelts, and their &s;peech Keltic: and i am told there are woods in Ireland, called <HI>Coit Keltich,</HI> or Keltic Woods, at this day. The origin of names is quite uncertain, and e&s;pecially in the Celtic language, which is &s;o lax, vague, and indefinite: but a que&s;|tion ari&s;es, how the wild Iri&s;h droped the indigenal name Kelts, and a&s;&s;umed the Roman appellation, Gael, or Gauls? On many occa&s;ions, as is well known, nations and &s;ocieties exchange the name
<PB N="33" REF="39" MS="y">they give them&s;elves, for a general foreign term, tho even of reproach. Thus &s;prang the names of Arabs, Quakers, Hugonots, &amp;c. Indeed this is nece&s;&s;arily the ca&s;e, for it is needle&s;s to retain a name only known to a particular nation, or &s;o|ciety, while all its neighbours concur in giv|ing it another; and it is forced, in every inter|cour&s;e with it's neighbours, to adopt the general term. There is a confu&s;ion of words in the Celtic language, naturally ari&s;ing from the confu&s;ed and mi&s;ty ideas, well known to be peculiar to the peo|ple. Thus the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite terms almo&s;t coa|le&s;ce: <HI>Ear</HI> is the Ea&s;t, <HI>Iar</HI> is the We&s;t: <HI>Gal</HI> is a foreigner, <HI>Ga&euml;l,</HI> a native. The confu&s;ion ari&s;ing from this proximity may ea&s;ily be gue&s;t. <HI>Galli,</HI> or foreigners, mu&s;t have been the name originally given by the Celts to the Germans, who poured into their country. <HI>Ga&euml;l</HI> &s;eems the word which the Greeks, who in their mu&s;ical language perverted all foreign names &s;adly, altered to <GAP DESC="foreign">. The Celtic G is indeed &s;o &s;harply pronounced, that it approaches to K. Ga&euml;l and Kelt may therefore be the &s;ame word, differently pronounced; while the Roman Gallus may be Gal, a foreigner. If this be granted, the que&s;tion is an&s;wered. But if Kelt, actually &s;o pronounced, was the old indigenal term, and Gael be Gallus, the Roman appellation; the name mu&s;t have been a&s;&s;umed from the Ro|mans in Britain. To the former opinion i rather incline; for the Iri&s;h language was much &s;oftened by the bards, as all their antiquaries agree: and Gha&euml;lt may have been the old name &s;oftened by Greek and Roman pronunciation to Kelt, and by the progre&s;s of the Iri&s;h language to Ga&euml;l.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t colonies that followed the Gauls to Ire|land, &s;eem to have been from Britain. Lloyd tells us the general tradition among the Welch, that the Cumri expelled the Guidhil from Britain into Ireland, a tradition confirmed by &s;everal of the olde&s;t names of rivers, mountains, &amp;c. in
<PB N="34" REF="40" MS="y">England and Wales being Gaelic, not Cumraig. The Celts of Gaul may be infallibly concluded, from proximity, to have been the fir&s;t tenants of Britain. The Cumri, or German Celts, &s;eem to have arrived at a much later period: and in all probability in con&s;equence of the Gothic progre&s;s from the ea&s;t. The Cumri, or Northern Celts, were far &s;uperior to the Gallic Celts in prowe&s;s; as is clear from their conque&s;t of Gaul in the time of Marius; not to &s;peak of the con&s;tant &s;uperior hardine&s;s of northern nations. The Guidhil, or Gael, fled before them; and Ireland received them. Population was then very thin; but perhaps as many Ga&euml;l proceeded on this occa&s;ion to Ireland, as had formerly pa&s;&s;ed from Gaul. They were one identic people with the fir&s;t colonies, who, no doubt, with open arms received &s;uch a reinforce|ment of brethren. This event clo&s;ed the original population of Ireland: and the Wild Iri&s;h are thus partly from Gaul, partly from Britain.</P>
<P>The Alien Colonies now claim attention. It is highly probable that, when the Belgae, or Goths, fir&s;t came to Britain, about 300 years before our aera, a great number of the Cumri were driven to Ireland. Richard of Cirence&s;ter &s;ays, under the year of the world 3650, that is, by his calculation, about 350 years before our aera, <HI>Circa haec tempora in Hyberniam commigrarunt ejecti a Belgis Brittones, ibique &s;edes po&s;uerunt, ex illo tempore Scotti appellati.</HI> In the later point he is certainly mi&s;taken, for the name Scotti was a far later appellative; and was given to the Scythae of Ireland. But that many Cumri, or <HI>Brittones,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed about that time into Ireland, there is every rea&s;on to believe.</P>
<P>So much for the Celtic, or &s;avage, colonization of Ireland. We now come to the colonies of rude Goths, then a barbarous people, but always ad|vancing in &s;ociety, while the Celts remained as they were. A barbarous people is indeed as much &s;uperior to a &s;avage one, as a civilized to a bar|barous.

<P>That the Goths had arrived at the extremity of Germany, and penetrated into Gaul, about 500 years before our aera, is &s;hewn in the annexed Di&s;&s;ertation. That the Belgae, a part of the&s;e Gorths, had pa&s;t to Britain, and peopled all the &s;outh and ea&s;t of pre&s;ent England, is clear from Cae&s;ar, who came to Britain 54 years before the Chri&s;tian epoch. From the full &s;tate of that popu|lation, and other incidents mentioned by Cae&s;ar, it &s;eems certain that not le&s;s than two, or three, centuries could po&s;&s;ibly effect it; and it may there|fore be &s;afely argued, that the Belgae had begun to colonize Britain, at lea&s;t 300 years before Chri&s;t's birth. That they had pa&s;t to Ireland much about the &s;ame time may be thus &s;hewn. From Ptolemy's de&s;cription of Ireland, written about 150 years after Chri&s;t, it is clear that the Menapii, a people of the coa&s;t of Belgic Gaul, held at that time large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the &s;outh of Ireland; as did the Cauci, a people of Germany, originally on the coa&s;t north of the Rhine. Now it &s;eems certain that the&s;e nations could not have pa&s;t to Ireland either in Roman times, or even in times of which the memory was recent, when Cae&s;ar came to Britain. For Cae&s;ar, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Mela, Pliny, Tacitus, who all de&s;cribe Ireland, Gaul, Germany, could never have been &s;ilent about this event, while they &s;o
<PB N="36" REF="42" MS="y">minutely detail the origins of any nations that they could di&s;cover. Commerce rendered Ireland well known to the Romans of Ptolemy's time, as is clear from his geography of it, which is very accu|rate for the age. Tacitus indeed ob&s;erves that, in his time, the ports of Ireland were more vi&s;ited by merchants, than tho&s;e of Britain: the cau&s;e of which &s;eems to me to have been, that the commer|cial articles of Britain were now con&s;umed by the home-trade of the Romans, actually living in Bri|tain, &s;o that merchants applied to Ireland for the &s;kins, &amp;c. The imports mu&s;t al&s;o have been much le&s;&s;ened; becau&s;e the Roman manufacturers &s;upplied the natives with copper and iron, earthen ware, &amp;c. while the con&s;umption of tho&s;e articles in Ireland, where there were no Roman manufac|turers, mu&s;t have remained in full force. By this trade with Ireland that country, in Ptolemy's time, was as much known to the Romans, as Japan, or any country traded to by Europeans, is to us. Had the Menapii and Cauci pa&s;t from Germany and Belgic Gaul to Ireland, in Roman times, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that this event could e&s;cape &s;o many writers. Pliny in particular, that curious inve&s;tigator, had &s;erved in Germany, and written Twenty Books on the German Wars, before he began his Natural Hi&s;tory, yet had not heard of this colonization. Cae&s;ar, who de&s;cribes Ireland, Gaul, and Germany, knew nothing of it, tho from his work it be plain that he was ver&s;t in the traditional hi&s;tory of the Gauls and Germans. I be|lieve it will therefore be granted that this coloni|zation mu&s;t have been much more ancient than Cae&s;ar's time; and, that if we allow it to have hap|pened two or three centuries before that time, we &s;hall be as near the truth as po&s;&s;ible in a ca&s;e of this kind. The Belgae, and the Cauci their neigh|bours, &s;eeing the &s;ucce&s;s of their brethren in Bri|tain, woud naturally be in&s;tigated to &s;imilar ex|cur&s;ions. The pa&s;&s;age to Ireland was longer, but
<PB N="37" REF="43" MS="y">the acqui&s;ition ea&s;ier, as the Cumri or Northern Celts of Britain were the victors of tho&s;e very Gael, or Southern Celts, who held Britain. The Goths had in Britain to encounter the victors: in Ireland the vanqui&s;hed. As this was the ca&s;e, perhaps the Gothic &s;ettlement in Ireland even preceded that in Britain; for &s;uch affairs do not proceed on a fanciful mechani&s;m. But as no cer|tainty can ever be acquired on either &s;ide in this que&s;tion, it &s;eems mo&s;t proper, with the allow|ance u&s;ually made in &s;uch ca&s;es, to date both events about one and the &s;ame time, 300 years before our aera.</P>
<P>That the Menapii and Cauci were not the only Belgic or German nations, that then pa&s;&s;ed to Ire|land, there is every rea&s;on to infer. In Britain there were Belgae proper, and many tribes of Belgae with various names, not found on the con|tinent. In Ireland the <HI>Eblani,</HI> on the north of the Cauci proper, &s;eem a Caucic tribe. The <HI>Luceni</HI> &s;eem to have been of the <HI>Leuaci,</HI> who lay next to the Menapii in Belgic Gaul; <HI>Leuac</HI> and <HI>Luc</HI> being &s;imilar, and <HI>en</HI> only the German plural. The <HI>Au|teri</HI> may have been <HI>Atrebates;</HI> al&s;o a people near the Menapii, in their original &s;eats. The <HI>Vela-bri</HI> may have been of the <HI>Velo-ca&s;&s;i</HI> on the &s;hore of Belgic Gaul, the la&s;t &s;yllables being varied epi|thets. The <HI>Vodii</HI> apparently bear a German name<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vodo</HI>-goriacum was a town of the Nervii, <HI>Itin. Aug. Tak. Peut. Bodo</HI>-briga of the Treveri. The Teuto-<HI>Bodiaci</HI> were part of the Galatae, who were Germans.</NOTE>: and the <HI>Iverni</HI> from their &s;ituation and name &s;eem to have been Belgae. Mr. O'Conor allows that hardly one of Ptolemy's names admits of a Celtic derivation; and the probable inference is, that the chief nations were not of Celtic origin. The greater part of Ireland was certainly &s;ubdued by the Belgae; and rude towns and forts erected by them to maintain the conque&s;t. The Celts, having

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="38" REF="46">now no further refuge, could not fly from the con|queror; but remained the numerous population of the ile; and their language of cour&s;e in time prevailed. But the power of the Belgae even Iri&s;h hi&s;tory and tradition imply. For <HI>Bolg</HI> &s;igni|fies to this day a nobleman, and al&s;o a man of &s;cience; and there are many old fortified hills &s;till called <HI>Dun Bolg,</HI> or forts of the Belgae.</P>
<P>As the Belgae entered on the South of Ireland, the Celts would naturally crowd to the North. About two hundred years before Chri&s;t, a va&s;t number of Cumri retired thither from pre&s;ent Scotland upon the entrance of the Piks into that country, as before &s;hewn. It appears from Pto|lemy, that three Briti&s;h tribes had al&s;o &s;ettlements in Ireland, namely, the <HI>Coriondi</HI> or <HI>Coritani</HI> and <HI>Brigantes,</HI> in the South; and the <HI>Voluntii</HI> in the North. The&s;e tribes &s;eem to have been naturally directed in their choice by their Gothic and Celtic origin. The <HI>Coritani</HI> and <HI>Brigantes,</HI> Go|thic neighbours in Britain, &s;ettled on the South of Ireland. The <HI>Voluntii</HI> Celts of Cumberland &s;et|tled on the North, among their Celtic brethren. Richard dates this migration fifty-two years after Chri&s;t: and &s;ays, the&s;e nations retired to Ireland from the Roman arms; which &s;eems very probable. He adds the <HI>Cangi,</HI> as a fourth tribe; as he takes the <HI>Gangani</HI> of Ptolemy to be <HI>Cangani;</HI> but of this let every one think as he &s;ees proper. The &s;ame writer tells us that the <HI>Menapii</HI> and <HI>Cauci</HI> were in|faillibly <HI>nationes Teutonicae originis,</HI> 'nations of Teu|tonic origin,' that the time of their arrival was not known, but probably, as he gue&s;&s;es, a little before Cae&s;ar's time. The reader has above &s;een argu|ments for a dare yet a little earlier.</P>
<P>Thus were the Belgae and German Goths e&s;tab|li&s;hed in the &s;outh of Ireland. A mo&s;t curious and important que&s;tion now ari&s;es, namely, if any Scandinavian Goths &s;eized on the north of
<PB N="39" REF="47">Ireland in early times? This is a hinge upon which the whole hi&s;tory of Ireland turns.</P>
<P>That fabulous progeny the Tuath de Danan are here out of all que&s;tion. If they pa&s;&s;ed from pre|&s;ent Scotland, as all the Iri&s;h accounts bear, they were clearly Damnii, a Cumraig people, that fled before the Piks. If they were Danes, they mu&s;t be tho&s;e who, in the eighth century, for the fir&s;t time, appeared in Ireland. I incline, after more labour and inve&s;tigation than any part of Iri&s;h ori|gins has co&s;t me, to give this grand que&s;tion the negative; or to think that no Scandinavians ap|peared in Ireland before the eighth century, upon the following grounds.</P>
<P>What &s;eems totally to negative the que&s;tion at fir&s;t is, that there is no mention of the Scan|dinavians, of any Danes or Norwegians in Ireland, before the eighth century, in Tighernac, the annals of Ul&s;ter, or other authentic documents of real Iri&s;h hi&s;tory. In Cumineus, Adomnan, writers of the &s;eventh century, not a trace of Scandinavian inva&s;ion can be found. The prophecies of Co|lumba could hardly pa&s;s &s;uch an evil, had he fore&s;een what had never happened. Gildas, Nen|nius, Beda, are al&s;o quite &s;ilent. Sir James Ware therefore rightly &s;ays, that, in 795, <HI>primum,</HI> for the FIRST time, the Northern nations infe&s;ted Ire|land, as the Iri&s;h annals bear. It may be thought that as the Piks came from Norway to the He|budes; and entered upon their conque&s;t of pre|&s;ent Scotland on that &s;ide about 300 years before Chri&s;t; their Gothic brethren of Norway and Denmark might naturally be imagined to have made other incur&s;ions that way. But hi&s;tory does not bear &s;uch analogical rea&s;oning; and human affairs proceed not upon mechanical, or upon the|oretic, principles. In fact the effect was in this in&s;tance de&s;tructive of the cau&s;e. For the Piki&s;h and Dani&s;h colonies were &s;o large, that they may well be inferred to have exhau&s;ted the Scandina|vian
<PB N="40" REF="48">population &s;o much as to leave no occa&s;ion for emigration, for a long time. This was the ca&s;e with the Angli, Saxons, &amp;c. In ancient times the Lydians, as Herodotus &s;tates, formed an emigration of one half of the nation; but no more Lydians went to Hetruria afterward. The Danes were them&s;elves but a late Scandinavian colony; and their population mu&s;t have been a long time only &s;ufficient for their own territory. The <HI>Vitae</HI> and <HI>Angli</HI> &s;eem the fir&s;t colony they &s;ent out; and that only in the fifth and &s;ixth centuries. They are therefore out of the que&s;tion. The Scandinavians were exhau&s;ted by the Piki&s;h and Dani&s;h colonies. The former they might al&s;o, in the&s;e dark ages, regard as po&s;&s;e&s;t of all the iles on the we&s;t, and have of cour&s;e no temptation to invade their own countrymen. Certain it is, that no trace can be found of Danes, or Norwegians, invading Scotland, till the ninth century. Nor a &s;ingle trace in all the Iri&s;h annals of any northern nations, by any name whatever, a&s;&s;ailing Ireland till 795. About 210 years after Chri&s;t, as ap|pears from the Piki&s;h chronicle, a large colony of Piks &s;ettled in the north of Ireland; and they are remarkable to a late period in Iri&s;h annals, &amp;c. by the name of Cruthneans, the Iri&s;h term for the Piks. They had their own kings, and are a marked people, till the ninth century. Had any Scandinavians been in that tract, there is rea&s;on to que&s;tion if the Piks could have effected a &s;et|tlement. It is indeed no wonder that the Scan|dinavian &s;agas and hi&s;tories, &s;ilent about the Piks, Vitae and Angli, &s;hould be &s;ilent about this; and if any &s;aga &s;hould &s;peak of inva&s;ions of Ireland or Scotland, prior to the eighth century, no cre|dit can be paid to tho&s;e pieces written many cen|turies after, and in which early chronology is quite confounded. Concerning Prolemy's names of na|tions in the north of Ireland, <HI>Darnii</HI> (or <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mnii,</HI> as Richard from older and better MSS. reads), <HI>Ve|nicnii,
<PB N="41" REF="49">Robogdii, Nagnati, Erdini,</HI> i have con&s;ulted a learned Northern antiquary, who informs m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that they are not Scandinavian names. Had the Scandinavians made any inva&s;ions on Ireland, they would al&s;o, as in later times, have attacked the we&s;tern &s;hores of Britain; while there is not a hint of this to be found in Roman writers, who only mention the Scots of Ireland as invading the we&s;tern &s;hore, and Saxons the ea&s;t. It may fluc|tuate in the minds of &s;ome, that as the Piks, 300 years before Chri&s;t, came from Scandinavia to the Hebudes, and thence conquered and peopled pre|&s;ent Scotland; &s;o it &s;eems probable that other in|vaders would follow that tract to the north of Ire|land, long before the year 795 after Chri&s;t. But the fact is, that this &s;ame large colony of Piks would be, of nece&s;&s;ity, the very cau&s;e of prevent|ing &s;imilar inva&s;ions in that cour&s;e, till the me|mory of it had expired. For Caledonia, and the north of Ireland, were filled with Piks, or, in other words, with Scandinavians, which no doubt the Scandinavians perfectly knew from the inter|cour&s;e of &s;ingle &s;hips, or trading ve&s;&s;els. So that they would never think of attacking their country|men, till length of time had extingui&s;hed all &s;uch con&s;iderations. In future times they did not at|tack Iceland, lately colonized, but Scotland, who&s;e connexion was lo&s;t. It may be &s;aid that England pre&s;ents an exception to this remark, the Angli having only arrived in 547, and being at|tacked by the Danes in the beginning of the ninth century. But the Angli, tho of Scandina|vian origin, as the Danes, were quite a di&s;tinct nation, not only from the ancient Danes, but from the Iutes, their northern neighbours. The Iutes had their own kings; and &s;o had the Angli; as appears from Suhm's hi&s;tory of Denmark, and other works. So late as 830, Regnar Lodbrog, king of Denmark, was occupied in conquering the Iutes. The Angli were &s;till more remote from
<PB N="42" REF="50">Denmark than the Iutes. The Danes, in attack|ing the Angli of Britain, warred again&s;t a people always di&s;tinct from them&s;elves: while the Scan|dinavians and Piks were divi&s;ions of the &s;ame identic people. Be&s;ides the ca&s;es are, in another view, not parallel: for the Angli were only the <HI>conquerors</HI> who &s;ettled among the inhabitants of Northumbria, and were &s;oon lo&s;t among the in|habitants. The Piks, on the contrary, were the <HI>people</HI> of Caledonia. The Piks formed a great colony; and doubtle&s;s, as the I&s;landic, brought wives and family with them, or &s;ent for them when the ground was &s;ecured. Like the Lydians of Hetruria, they may have been a va&s;t di&s;con|tented party, or indeed like many modern colo|nies. On the fir&s;t arrival of the Goths in Scandi|navia, as they had enemies to &s;ubdue, they mu&s;t have proceeded in armies, and have formed large &s;tates under one government, as appears from Ta|citus in his account of the Suiones or Danes, and Sitones or Swedes; all the former of whom obeyed one king, the later one queen. Of cour&s;e, in the&s;e early times, the emigrating parties mu&s;t have been very large, and in proportion to the &s;tates. But in time, when the danger of the grand Ge|neric foe, as the Fins for in&s;tance, was abated, the warlike &s;pirit of the Goths broke out often among them&s;elves, and &s;plit them into numerous petty kingdoms and &s;tates; as we know was the ca&s;e in Norway till the ninth century, and in Denmark and Sweden, tho not quite &s;o long. In Britain the Piks were kept together, from con&s;tant danger of the Cumri, their &s;outhern neighbours; &s;o we learn of no divi&s;ions among them, &s;ave con|tentions for the crown. But in Scandinavia the Fins being driven beyond the Bothnic gulf, and the Vends inhabiting only the &s;outh of the Baltic, the Goths were &s;ecure from Generic foes, and often immer&s;ed in dome&s;tic wars, and &s;plit into con|tending &s;tates. Tho&s;e dome&s;tick wars weakened
<PB N="43" REF="51" MS="y">them much, till &s;even or eight centuries after Chri&s;t, when monarchs of &s;uperior talents &s;ubdued the re&s;t, and formed again into one powerful &s;tate, what &s;ecurity from foreign foes had divided, &s;oon after the Generic foe was &s;ubdued. Attention to all the&s;e circum&s;tances becomes nece&s;&s;ary to form a proper judgment upon this que&s;tion. The rea|der mu&s;t reflect on the three grand &s;tages of Scan|dinavian government:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Great &s;tates, united un|der one &s;upreme power, again&s;t a Generic foe.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Tho&s;e &s;tates &s;plit into &s;mall ones by diffen|tion from &s;ecurity, and from want of a common foe.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Great &s;tates formed by the &s;mall ones being &s;ubdued by one monarch, as the heptarchies of England.</ITEM>
</LIST>
The middle &s;tage of &s;mall &s;tates is the mo&s;t un&s;uitable for emigration; becau&s;e the po|pulation is con&s;umed by dome&s;tic war. In the fir&s;t and third &s;tages alone the Scandinavian co|lonies emigrated. Con&s;idering the Piks therefore in this light, during the fir&s;t &s;tage, or till about a century after Chri&s;t, the memory of this grand we&s;tern colony was quite recent; and the Scandi|navians could no more dream of &s;ending out fre&s;h colonies, or of invading that quarter, than we of &s;ending colonies to North America, or the Spaniards to the South, already in their own oc|cupation. During the &s;econd &s;tage, till &s;even or eight centuries after our aera, dome&s;tic war en|gaged all attention, and de&s;troyed population, &s;o that no colonies nor invaders could be &s;ent. Dur|ing the third &s;tage fre&s;h inva&s;ions naturally aro&s;e. From all the&s;e rea&s;ons it &s;eems clear that before the year 795 the Scandinavians never invaded Ire|land. Indeed, he who a&s;&s;erts that they did mu&s;t do it upon his own authority; as the negative te&s;timony of all the ancients, Roman, and Briti&s;h, and Iri&s;h, is mo&s;t cogent again&s;t him. Such being the &s;tate of the que&s;tion, the Scandinavians are to be regarded as having no part in Iri&s;h origins.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="52" MS="y">The ancient hi&s;tory of Ireland is therefore the hi&s;tory of the Belgic and German Goths in Ireland. And the reader having thus &s;een the detail of Iri&s;h origins, it remains to con&s;ider the name of Scots.</P>
<P>Many etymologies have been given of the word <HI>Scot.</HI> All the more ancient writers concur in re|pre&s;enting it as the &s;ame with <HI>Scyth,</HI> or <HI>Scythian:</HI> an opinion which prevailed till the pre&s;ent century. Of the late Dr. Macpher&s;on &s;uppo&s;es <HI>Scuit,</HI> or <HI>Scot</HI> to &s;ignify a <HI>&s;mall body</HI> of men; Mr. Whita|ker, <HI>wanderers,</HI> or <HI>refugees.</HI> Others more plau&s;ibly derive it from <HI>Coit,</HI> a wood; or from <HI>Schut,</HI> a boat, or &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, as Ireland abounded with woods, and the Scots attacked Britain in &s;uch ve&s;|&s;els. Others from <HI>Scutten,</HI> to &s;hoot.</P>
<P>An opinion which, on ignorant repre&s;entation, &s;eems erroneous, will often, when &s;upported on due grounds, a&s;&s;ume quite another appearance. The fir&s;t etymon of <HI>Scot,</HI> as the &s;ame with <HI>Scyth,</HI> or Scythian, &s;eemed to me mo&s;t ridiculous; as the Scots of Ireland, as &s;oon as known in hi&s;tory, &s;poke the Celtic tongue. But on the &s;lighte&s;t reflec|tion this was found no argument; for the Franks, or French, tho &s;till &s;o called, do not &s;peak Francic; but the corrupted Roman of Gaul, where they &s;ettled. The Normans of France in two centuries after &s;ettling, &s;poke not Norman, but Romance al&s;o. The Angli &s;poke not Dani&s;h, after fixing here, but the Belgic of England. All the&s;e na|tions, with many others, retained their name, tho they changed their language. In &s;hort, a &s;mall nation, &s;ettling in any country, may retain it's name, may give it to all the country; yet will ever lo&s;e it's &s;peech in that of the population of the country. Such are human affairs; and hence gro&s;s impropriety ri&s;es: for the French language is not the French, but the Roman; the Engli&s;h not Engli&s;h, but Belgic; the Iri&s;h-Scoti&s;h, not Scy|thic, but Celtic.</P>

St. Patrick in his Epi&s;tles evinces this. The <HI>Scoti,</HI> whom he generally marks as <HI>Reguli</HI> and <HI>Nobiles,</HI> he uniformly di&s;tingui&s;hes from the <HI>Hyberionae</HI> and <HI>Hybernigenae,</HI> terms for the commonalty.</P></NOTE>, but it is believed that the&s;e may &s;uffice to &s;hew that the Scots were tho&s;e Scythae, namely the Belgae and Germans, who vanqui&s;hed Ireland. The rea&s;on why Nennius, and other writers of the middle ages, who expre&s;&s;ly tell us, that the Scots were Scythae, yet repre&s;ent them as coming from Spain, was that ab&s;urd etymology of <HI>Ibernia</HI> from <HI>Iberia.</HI> But it is now granted on all hands that Hibernia is a name ari&s;ing from the <HI>we&s;tern</HI> &s;ituation of this fine iland; and that Scotia is an appellation ari&s;ing from the Scots &s;ettling in it. So that this opinion of the Scots having come from Spain, or Iberia, &s;prung from a ridiculous etymology; and is be|neath all notice, being of a piece with the Brutus of Geoffrey of Monmouth. The names of the Scoti&s;h kings in Ireland are al&s;o Gothic, not Celtic.
<PB N="47" REF="55">Such is <HI>Leogaire</HI> the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian king, for who is ignorant that Leogaire is al&s;o the name of a Francic king; and is a German name, <HI>Leof-gard,</HI> 'a keeper of love,' as Leopold, Leonard, &amp;c.? Some of the names of Scoti&s;h or Iri&s;h kings are no doubt Celtic epithets, given them by their peo|ple; but others are mere Gothic names. Such are <HI>Conary,</HI> or <HI>Conrad, Hugh, Hugony; Nial</HI> is quite a Gothic name, familiar in Runic monuments, and Icelandic &s;agas. Are not the <HI>O'Brians</HI> from the <HI>Briani</HI> of Belgic Gaul? The Celtic language changes almo&s;t all words to it's own form; and even in the Iri&s;h bible the names are forced to be changed and accommodated to that odd &s;peech. Thus <HI>Alexander</HI> can only be put <HI>Ali&s;dair; Adam</HI> is <HI>Adhamh; Andrew</HI> is <HI>Aindra; Bartholomew</HI> is <HI>Par|tholan; Daniel</HI> is <HI>Donuil; David</HI> is <HI>Dabhi; Gideon, Gide-eon; James, Semis; John, Eoin; Peter, Phedair; Samuel, Somhairle:</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Such being the ca&s;e, the &s;trange perver&s;ion of Gothic names in the Celtic language is ea&s;ily accounted for. My pre&s;ent &s;ubject forbids my entering at full length into this point; but from peru&s;al of the Annals of Ul&s;ter i am fully convinced that the names of not only the Iri&s;h monarchs, but of mo&s;t of the provincial king|lets, are Gothic.</P>
<P>But long before Chri&s;tianity was &s;ettled in Ire|land, perhaps indeed before the birth of Chri&s;t, the Scots, or Scythae, who conquered Ireland, had lo&s;t their &s;peech in that of the greater number of the Celts, the common people, as u&s;ually hap|pens. From England and Scotland the Celts had crouded to the we&s;t, and va&s;t numbers had pa&s;t to Ireland. The mountainous north and we&s;t of Eng|land, the friths of Scotland, had formed barriers between the Goths and Celts. But in Ireland, the grand and la&s;t receptacle of the Celts, and whither almo&s;t their whole remains finally flowed, it is no wonder that the Gothic conquerors, the Scots, lo&s;t their &s;peech in that of the population.
<PB N="48" REF="56">In Britain, the Celts who remained were much improved by Roman intercour&s;e; and the &s;upe|riority of the Welch to the Iri&s;h Celts appears in the laws of Howel Dha, in their hi&s;toric fables, in the &s;uperior accuracy of their language, and in the name they gave, and give, the Iri&s;h Celts, <HI>Guydhil,</HI> or <HI>Wild Men.</HI> Originally indeed the Northern Celts, or Cumri, were &s;uperior to the Southern, or Gael, in &s;trength of mind and body; as the conque&s;ts of the former over the later prove. The Wild Iri&s;h are at this day known to be &s;ome of the verie&s;t &s;avages in the globe; and &s;eem by nature intended as a medial race between bea&s;ts and men. The chief families in Ireland, and the indu&s;trious and civilized part of the people, are all of Gothic de&s;cent, as Scots, Danes, Norwe|gians, and laterly Engli&s;h and modern Scots. What intere&s;t they can have therefore in &s;upport|ing the Celtic vi&s;ions, which, far from honouring, really di&s;grace their country, it were difficult to &s;ay; did not we &s;ee national prejudice, another name for national madne&s;s, often &s;wallow up every &s;park of di&s;cernment. The Engli&s;h, till the pre&s;ent century, were fighting for the Welch anti|quities, as doing honour to their nation; and the Scots are following the &s;ame tract to this day. The bards, and &s;ennachies, authors of all this perdition to the hi&s;tory of Great Britain and Ire|land, were &s;trollers of the genuine Celtic breed.</P>
<P>So much for the origin of the Scots<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><P>The origin of the Scots, above given, is confirmed by Ware, who &s;hews that <HI>Scythae</HI> and <HI>Scotti</HI> were but different names for the &s;ame people; and both are called <HI>Scutten</HI> by the Germans.

Eccard, in his Origines Germanicae, has curious remarks confirming the German origin of the Iri&s;h Goths, &s;uch as "Re&s;tant in Fri&s;iorum et Hibe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">norum lingua quae arcte conve|niunt, atque in reliquis dialectis vix reperiuntur."

<PB N="49" REF="57">early Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, which is that of the Scots, or Goths in Ireland. That they &s;ubdued Ireland with united arms, and divided it as u&s;ual among their chiefs and &s;oldiers, is apparent from all Iri&s;h writers ancient and modern; and inferable from others, as Oro&s;ius, Beda, &amp;c. who repre&s;ent Ire|land as fully po&s;&s;e&s;t by the Scots. The nature of the acqui&s;ition would, in all likelihood, render the &s;everal divi&s;ions monarchic; and one monarch or other would be acknowledged &s;uperior; as, we learn from Cae&s;ar, was the ca&s;e among the &s;tates of Gaul. In other countries, vanqui&s;hed by the Goths, the Celts totally retired apart, as did the Welch when the Saxons came here; and the vic|tors &s;ometimes formed monarchies, &s;ometimes re|publics; being all freemen, and having no con|quered &s;ubjects to keep under. But in Ireland, that grand refuge of Celtic population, the &s;tates could not be republican, as three quarters of the &s;ubjects could form no part of the government; &s;o that it mu&s;t in all appearance have remained military, that is monarchic. In this all the Iri&s;h accounts agree; and in 432, when Patrick went to Ireland, we find Leogaire <HI>Rex Hiberniae,</HI> king of Ireland by eminence. The idea a&s;&s;erted by Maitland, and &s;ome others, that Leogaire was the fir&s;t king of this &s;upreme title, is chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">di&s;h and in|vidious. We might as ju&s;tly reject all the Dani&s;h, Swedi&s;h, and Norwegian annals, prior to Chri&s;|tianity's
<PB N="50" REF="58" MS="y">being e&s;tabli&s;hed in tho&s;e countries. How far back the kings of Ireland can be named with certainty, becomes not me to &s;ay, who have not &s;een the original documents. This is therefore &s;ubmitted to the antiquaries of that kingdom. Mr. O'Conor<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ertations.</NOTE> dates the commencement of the genuine li&s;t at the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the palace of &s;upreme royalty, at Emania in Ul&s;ter, &s;even gene|rations, or about 210 years, before our aera. The Pagan period of Iri&s;h hi&s;tory &s;eems to fall into two divi&s;ions; The OBSCURE, from the arrival of the Scots, till the reign of Tuathal the Acceptable, about 137 years after Chri&s;t: and The DAWNING, from the reign of Tuathal, till Patrick's arrival in 432, after which all is clear. Mr. O'Conor<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</NOTE> re|marks that Tuathal's reign forms a new and cer|tain epoch in the progre&s;s of Iri&s;h hi&s;tory. Fo|reigners may imagine that it is granting too much to the Iri&s;h to allow them li&s;ts of kings more an|cient than of any other country in modern Europe: but the &s;ingularly compact and remote &s;ituation of that iland, and it's freedom from Roman con|que&s;t, and from the concu&s;&s;ions of the fall of the Roman empire, may infer this allowance not too much. But all contended for, is the li&s;t of kings, &s;o ea&s;ily pre&s;erved by the repetition of bards at high &s;olemnities; and &s;ome grand events of hi&s;tory. For to expect a certain detail, and regular order, in the pagan hi&s;tory of Ireland, were extravagant. The Iri&s;h antiqui&s;ts will, on the other hand, ex|claim again&s;t this rejection of &s;o many fables, which they call, and perhaps, if the human mind can be &s;o deba&s;ed, really think hi&s;tory. Mr. O'Conor &s;ays that the period from Tuathal to Leogaire is the mo&s;t u&s;eful and important of the whole heathen hi&s;tory of Ireland. In which he is certainly right: and the traditions and bardi&s;h rhymes, with the early attention of the Iri&s;h, after
<PB N="51" REF="59" MS="y">conver&s;ion, to &s;uch learning as was then in vogue, promi&s;e con&s;iderably veracity to this la&s;t pagan pe|riod. Sir James Ware was confe&s;&s;edly ignorant of the Iri&s;h language; &s;o that his rejection of all the pagan hi&s;tory of Ireland was at be&s;t ra&s;h. But indeed the Iri&s;h writers, like the dog in the fable, lo&s;e the &s;ub&s;tance, by gra&s;ping at the &s;hadow: and their fal&s;ehoods are &s;o wild, that it is no wonder they nau&s;eate the public again&s;t the whole. The claim of letters in Ireland, preceding Chri&s;tianity, is alone &s;ufficient to cau&s;e the rejection of the whole early hi&s;tory of that country, by all the literati of Europe: and he who a&s;&s;erts &s;uch a glaring fal&s;e|hood is the bittere&s;t enemy of his country, and in his madne&s;s di&s;graces, when he means to honour. But it is the duty of a cool enquirer after truth not to allow the frenzy of &s;uch writers to hurt any cau&s;e, which they either attack, or defend.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Progre&s;s of the Old Scots, or Dalriads, from Ireland to North Britain.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with infinite concern, that toward the clo&s;e of the Eighteenth century, i am forced to contend again&s;t modern errors in Scoti&s;h antiqui|ties, that would have di&s;graced the Thirteenth. Superficiality is the parent of error: and in anti|quities, a &s;ubject requiring the utmo&s;t labour, and mo&s;t profound and exuberant reading, it is no wonder that the fruit of &s;uperficiality is mon&s;trous. Cla&s;&s;ical learning, as it is called, that is, a little dabbling in Greek and Roman cla&s;&s;ics, has in all ages formed the &s;um total of Scoti&s;h literature. In the pre&s;ent e&s;pecially, even our little learning has gradually le&s;&s;ened; and <HI>philo&s;ophy,</HI> or really <HI>rea&s;oning ignorance,</HI> &s;upplies it's place. If philo|&s;ophy has not extingui&s;hed common &s;en&s;e among us, we mu&s;t know that human hi&s;tory proceeds upon no theoretic principles, but upon facts
<PB N="52" REF="60">eternally contradictive of all theory; and that the&s;e facts can only be found in ancient authorities. To judge of antiquities upon a &s;light acquaintance with the cla&s;&s;ics, and with philo&s;ophic theory, is &s;o ab&s;urd, that to mention &s;uch an idea is to ex|cite laughter. Yet it is a lamentable truth, that &s;uch is the plan of examining Scoti&s;h origins, among all our writers of this century, &s;ave Innes. The authors of the middle ages, the genuine foun|tains of information, are not even known by name to our puerile &s;cribblers. The gold of truth, which is hid deep in the &s;oil, they look for upon the &s;ur|face of cla&s;&s;ic reading, and in the open day of phi|lo&s;ophy. Antiquities, the &s;evere&s;t of all &s;tudies in learned countries, are in mine the amu&s;ement, as they call it, of mere boys, who would any where el&s;e be &s;ent to &s;chool. Puerile errors have begot puerile prejudices; and, in the frenzy of tho&s;e prejudices again&s;t a re&s;pectable nation, the Iri&s;h, it is ri&s;ible to &s;ee our antiqui&s;ts forget that, even judging by tho&s;e prejudices, it is more di&s;|graceful to the Scots to have been the fathers of the Iri&s;h, than the contrary. For is it more di&s;honour|able to have a fooli&s;h father, or a fooli&s;h &s;on?</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to enter into any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of that ab&s;urd que&s;tion, Whether the old Scots proceeded from Ireland to North Britain, or from North Bri|tain to Ireland? That progre&s;s is detailed in the two following chapters. All that can be &s;aid to our Scoti&s;h antiqui&s;ts is, Read: and read as on any other &s;ubject, without prejudice. A few hints &s;hall however be given, after premi&s;ing that the origin of the PRESENT Scots, or people &s;o called after the Eleventh century, is not here di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, but re&s;erved for after-con&s;ideration. It is that of the old Scots in Britain, otherwi&s;e called Dalriads, which is here examined. The origin of the opi|nion that the old Scots proceeded to Ireland from North Britain, may well be &s;uppo&s;ed Celtic, that is in the inver&s;e ratio of rea&s;on, and is accordingly
<PB N="53" REF="61">to be fir&s;t found in Lloyd's Archaeologia, printed in 1707, tho only in general terms concerning the progre&s;s of the Guydhil, or Ga&euml;l, from Britain to Ireland. Dr. Mackenzie, in the preface to his Scoti&s;h Writers, publi&s;hed in 1708, greedily pur|&s;ued this &s;cent; and, like a young hound, yelped much, but caught no prey. Gordon followed in a mo&s;t impudent and lying &s;ection of his <HI>Itinerarium Septentrionale,</HI> London 1726, folio. Yet Innes, who&s;e book was publi&s;hed in 1729, &s;eems to have looked on this new opinion as beneath notice; for he &s;ays nothing of it. This favourite plant of ignorance &s;till thrived, and a&s;&s;umed fre&s;h vigour, in Maitland's Hi&s;tory of Scotland, 1757; and in Goodal's Introduction to Fordun, 1759. And la&s;tly the two Macpher&s;ons have dunged it afre&s;h, in recent publications. In vain did Robert|&s;on and Hume te&s;tify again&s;t it. A new plan of inve&s;tigating antiquities was introduced for Scot|land exclu&s;ively. Other countries re&s;t ancient facts totally upon ancient authorities; but for Scotland all authorities were to be cut down. The word of command was, "Put out the candles that we may &s;ee the clearer!"</P>
<P>It was my de&s;ign to have laid before the reader a numerical ab&s;tract of all the arguments advanced by Maitland, Goodal, and the Macpher&s;ons, again&s;t the Iri&s;h extract of the old Scots of Britain; and to give an&s;wers in like order. But, after care|ful and repeated peru&s;al of tho&s;e doughty cham|pions, i was forced to relinqui&s;h the de&s;ign, le&s;t the reader &s;hould imagine that i was &s;porting at his ex|pence; and fighting with &s;hades of utter ignorance and folly, of my own creation, in order that my great wi&s;dom &s;hould appear con&s;picuous in the victory. Another grand rea&s;on was that i really could not find one argument u&s;ed by the&s;e writers, that would bear a repetition. To any man who, with Democritus, delights in laughing at the madne&s;s of mankind, there cannot be a greater
<PB N="54" REF="62">fea&s;t than the peru&s;al of the Scoti&s;h and Iri&s;h con|te&s;t on their origins. Much cunning upon one &s;ide, much weakne&s;s on the other, while that &s;u|preme godde&s;s Ignorance &s;its umpire, and deals out her equal favours in the large&s;t proportion to both parties. On the Iri&s;h &s;ide nothing can be charged, but a &s;hameful credulity and obduracy in ancient fable. But our Scoti&s;h antiqui&s;ts, ignorant them&s;elves, and writing in a country remarkable for ignorance of antiquities, are like other rogues, emboldened by darkne&s;s; and venture on tricks, that the mo&s;t unprincipled man of learning would, in a learned country, tremble at, as if the pillory &s;tood before him. This cen&s;ure may be thought &s;evere; but Truth whi&s;pers me, that it is not &s;uffi|ciently &s;evere for the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e four Scoti&s;h champions of fal&s;ehood have had the honour to introduce quite a new &s;tyle of compo&s;ition. The only arguments they u&s;e are of two kinds: 1. Railing again&s;t all ancient autho|rities, which, by a madne&s;s unknown in any other country, they think they can <HI>confute!</HI> 2. A&s;&s;ertions totally fal&s;e, and impudent. Far from being learned, they have not even tho&s;e ideas which lead to learning; and thus their arguments, far from being accurate, are un&s;cientific, nay irrational, and &s;uch as never were u&s;ed before in any literary que&s;tion whatever. Their heat is &s;o extreme as to excite utter di&s;gu&s;t; and to merit being repre&s;&s;ed by all the indignation of in&s;ulted &s;cience. The O&s;&s;ian Macpher&s;on in particular u&s;es a mo&s;t extra|vagant &s;tyle. He &s;ays he has <HI>finally decided</HI> the que&s;tion, a que&s;tion of ancient facts and circum|&s;tances, from his dabling in modern Gaelic, while there is not one MS. in Gaelic upon the matter! A boy at &s;chool would know that a man may be able to &s;peak, nay read, Engli&s;h; and yet not de|cide upon Engli&s;h origins. But &s;uch are Celtic under&s;tandings! The &s;tyle of the later writer is indeed peculiarly Celtic, hyperbolic, and bom|ba&s;tic.
<PB N="55" REF="63">Genius in O&s;&s;ian was well; but in a que&s;|tion of this kind it is frenzy. The only powers of mind to be exerted are learning, clear and cool comprehen&s;ion, veracity, and penetration. But Mr. Macpher&s;on pretends to build a hou&s;e with a &s;word: and he has only wounded him&s;elf. A book like his is indeed &s;ufficient to <HI>decide</HI> a que&s;tion; for if ignorance and fal&s;ehood be on one &s;ide, it follows that learning and truth will be on the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;trange writers have betrayed me into a &s;tyle perhaps unworthy of my purpo&s;e, but which they de&s;erve.

And how an&s;wer writers who childi&s;hly take the Hibernia of the an|cients for Scotland; the Ierne of Greek and Ro|man writers for Stratherne; the Mona of Cae&s;ar, for Aemona, in the frith of Forth; <HI>Tethyca vallis</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><P>Gildas, who&s;e work is a &s;trange poetical rant, or rather pro&s;e run mad, u&s;es <HI>vallis</HI> for the &s;ea, as Claudian

May that power, from whom the holy right of rea&s;on &s;prings, pre|vent mine from being deba&s;ed &s;o far! Not content with a&s;&s;ertions ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, &s;uch as that the Highlanders call their country <HI>Caeldoch,</HI> that the Iri&s;h call their language <HI>Gaelich Eirinach,</HI> &amp;c, &amp;c. &amp;c. they refer mo&s;t fal&s;ely to authorities, which when examined, confute them: nay totally per|vert, interpolate, and mangle tho&s;e authorities which they quote. What name &s;hall we apply to &s;uch practices, happily quite unknown in other countries? Indeed i am apt to think that, in &s;ome countries, the antiquaries form an exception to the
<PB N="56" REF="64">national character. My countrymen are de&s;ervedly noted for probity; their antiquaries are ju&s;t the rever&s;e. Their &s;acrifice of all truth, to what they call the honour of Scotland, is proverbial. Deluded men! Can any honour &s;pring from fal&s;ehood? The people of England are &s;olid and &s;en&s;ible; their antiquaries generally mo&s;t vi&s;ionary. The French are gay and frivolous; their antiquaries grave and &s;olid. Let us then leave the <HI>lana caprina</HI> of confuting the&s;e writers to oblivion, that &s;ilent confuter of &s;uch attempts. Mr. Macpher&s;on has been happily confuted by Mr. Whitaker, who has &s;et non&s;en&s;e again&s;t non&s;en&s;e. For O&s;&s;ian, and Richard of Cirence&s;ter, are the authors upon whom Mr. Whitaker confutes the father of O&s;&s;ian. O&s;&s;ian and La Morte Arthur, which la&s;t Mr. W. ranks again&s;t Gildas and Beda, and gives a long hi&s;tory of king Arthur from it, were ju&s;t fit to produce that non&s;en&s;e which would counterpoize any other non&s;en&s;e. So that Mr. M. and Mr. W. and perfectly matched in judgement and &s;kill; and we are much obliged to Mr. W. for proving to us that Mr. M's theory could not &s;tand again&s;t non|&s;en&s;e it&s;elf.</P>
<Q>Ri&s;u &s;olvantur tabulae, tu mi&s;&s;us abibis.</Q>
<P>Not to wa&s;te time in a formal refutation of &s;uch writers as Maitland, Goodal, and the Macpher&s;ons, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve that all this work is a &s;ilent confutation of them; for by e&s;tabli&s;hing the truth all errors fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l before it.</P>
<P>One point de&s;erves con&s;ideration. Mr. Macpher|&s;on has mo&s;t ingenuou&s;ly and ingeniou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that on the fir&s;t mention of the Scots by Ammianus Marcellinus, at the year 360, we find them in Britain; and <HI>ergo</HI> the Scots were &s;ettled in Britain before they were in Ireland. By the &s;ame rule as Ammianus, at the year 369, mentions the Saxons in Britain, they were al&s;o &s;ettled in Britain. But the fact is, that Ammianus, in both places, is &s;peak|ing of the nations that invaded the Roman pro|vinces
<PB N="57" REF="65">in Britain. This is a &s;pecimen of the argu|ments of tho&s;e Scoti&s;h antiqui&s;ts; and the re&s;t are of the &s;ame &s;tamp; &s;o that the reader may judge whether they de&s;erve an&s;wer, or only laughter. Mr. M. is however forced to yield to that glaring and invincible truth, &s;upported by all antiquity, that the name of <HI>Scotia</HI> was long borne by Ireland, before given to Scotland. The truth is, as after fully &s;hewn in this work, that, from the Fourth Century to the Eleventh, the names <HI>Scotia</HI> and <HI>Scoti</HI> belonged &s;olely to Ireland, and the Iri&s;h. In the reign of Malcom II. or take at a medium the middle of this reign, and &s;ay about the year 1020, the name <HI>Scotia</HI> was fir&s;t applied to North Britain; but from its fir&s;t appearance to that time, it belonged to Ireland alone. No foreigner has been mi&s;led by the pitiful prejudices and fal&s;ehoods of our Scoti&s;h dablers. Cellarius, Eccard, Schoep|flin, D'Anville, the learned editors of the Hi&s;to|riens de France, Suhm, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. have all agreed in this point. But of this afterward. If therefore priority of name argues priority of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, the Scots mu&s;t have come from Ireland to Scotland. But this inference is not beyond con|trover&s;y. For the people may have gone from Scotland to Ireland, &s;ome will &s;ay; and the name of Scots have been there given them, yet after|ward, by &s;ome &s;trange contingence, have reverted to the parent country. That &s;uch a contingence is quite unknown to any other hi&s;tory, would not be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer, for analogy, tho u&s;eful in &s;uch ca&s;es, is not ab&s;olute proof. If any writer were to attempt to prove that Greece, far from being the parent country of Magna Graecia, was actually peopled from it, in what way is he to be confuted? The probability is indeed equal on both &s;ides (to &s;peak for once as a Scoti&s;h antiqui&s;t), and the grand mark, that of identic language, may be applied either way. It is certain therefore that the only information we can have on this, or
<PB N="58" REF="66">any other &s;ubject of ancient hi&s;tory, is that de|rived from ancient authorities; and in this pe|culiar and great in&s;tance, from the Tradition of the people them&s;elves. Now all writers, Engli&s;h, Scoti&s;h, and Iri&s;h, from Beda down to this &s;uper&s;icial century, agree in this point, that the Ancient Scots of North Britain were a colony from Ireland. And in all ages the Scoti&s;h highlanders have a&s;&s;ented: and the lowlanders, from Barbour in 1375, to this moment, call the highlanders Iri&s;hry, and their language Iri&s;h, Eri&s;h, or Er&s;e. This clear inference is fully confirmed by all the ancient accounts of the progre&s;s of the old Scots in Britain, now about to be detailed; and is &s;o firmly rooted in the whole ancient hi&s;tory of Britain and Ireland, that nothing but ignorance joined with frenzy could attempt to &s;hake it. Indeed igno|rance, the deepe&s;t ignorance, was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch an attempt; for profound ignorance judges of others by it&s;elf; and thinks that dark and dubi|ous to all, which is dark and dubious to it&s;elf alone, while others &s;ee it in the brighte&s;t day. An ignorant man will talk of opinion in the mathe|matics, becau&s;e he can form no idea how certain they are. Opinion is the &s;afe harbour of ignorance; and a benighted mind flies to it as a covert from utter &s;hame. He who would call it matter of opinion, whether the Greeks proceeded from Magna Graecia, or to it, would be regarded as a mere ignorant; and the progre&s;s of the old Scots from Ireland, is far more clear, and re&s;ts upon more numerous grounds than the former. Before i had in the lea&s;t examined this &s;ubject, i &s;aw it in the dark, and thought it doubtful; nay really bellived, from general theory, that the Iri&s;h Scots had pa&s;t from Scotland. When i had exa|mined it, i &s;aw that i had been totally wrong; and that the contrary was from ancient writers, and innumerable other le&s;&s;er lights and cir|cum&s;tances, only acquirable in a thorough exami|nation, as clear as day. Let tho&s;e who doubt
<PB N="59" REF="67">therefore only read, and examine, with a mere de&s;ire of knowing the truth, and &s;atisfying their own minds; and no arguments need be u&s;ed. The proofs are &s;o numerous, clear, and con&s;i&s;tent, that they afford a perfect blaze of truth; as many &s;mall lights will, at night, make a chamber as bright as noon.</P>

<P>SOME Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h antiquaries, as U&s;her, Bi&s;hop Lloyd, Stillingfleet, O'Flaherty, &amp;c. have, in their great zeal again&s;t the antiquity of the Scots in North Britain, pa&s;t this colony in ob|livion; and repre&s;ented the &s;econd colony in the year 503, as the fir&s;t &s;ettlement. The cogent authority of Beda they neglected, or railed again&s;t. That re&s;pectable writer, in his fir&s;t chapter, gives us the origin of the Britons, Piks, and Scots, in Bri|tain. In his &s;econd chapter he proceeds to the wars of Julius Cae&s;ar in Britain. Had Beda therefore followed &s;trict chronology, the Scots, by his ac|count, mu&s;t have been &s;ettled in Britain before Cae|&s;ar's time. But the Scots he introduces here, from their after connexion with the Piks, and that he may proceed to a continuous account of the Ro|man affairs in Britain. In like manner, under the year 449, he gives us the origin of the Iutes, Saxons, and Angli, in England; tho the Iutes alone arrived in that year, and there were no Saxons here till 477, nor Angli till 547. So, <HI>lib.</HI> I. <HI>c.</HI> 3. he places Ve&s;pa&s;ian after Claudius, and then pa&s;&s;es to Nero: and I. 20. he puts St. Germanus, who lived about 420, long after the battle of Badon, 520. Nennius, a writer of the next century, with a &s;till greater neglect of order, &s;ays, <HI>ch.</HI> 2. that in Britain at fir&s;t dwelled <HI>Scoti,

<P>The words of Beda are, <HI>Procedente autem tem|pore, Britannia, po&s;t Britones et Pictos, tertiam Scot|torum nationem in Pictorum parte recepit. Qui, duce Reuda, de Hibernia egre&s;&s;i vel amicitia, vel ferro, &s;ibi|met inter eos &s;edes, quas hactenus habent, vindica|rant. A quo videlicet duce u&s;que hodie Dalreudini vocantur; nam lingua eorum dal partem &s;ignificat.</HI> 'In proce&s;s of time Britain, after the Britons and Piks, received a third nation, that of the Scots, in the part belonging to the Piks. Who emigrating from Ireland, under their leader Reuda, either by friend&s;hip or arms vindicated to them&s;elves tho&s;e &s;eats among them, which they to this time hold. From which leader they are called Dalreudini to this day; for in their language <HI>dal</HI> &s;ignifies a part<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Dal,</HI> or <HI>Dael,</HI> is a <HI>part</HI> in the Gothic, not in the Celtic, in which Dal &s;ignifies a <HI>tribe</HI> (Kennedy, p. 100), and is quite common in Iri&s;h hi&s;tory. An ea&s;y metonymy. But the Scots of Ireland, it is likely, retained more of their own Gothic words, in their fir&s;t meanings, in Beda's time, than after.</P></NOTE>.'</P>
<P>This very pre&s;ervation of the name of the leader by Beda argues a late &s;ettlement; and accord|ingly we find that it took place about the year 258. For the REUDA of Beda is the READA of king Alfred's tran&s;lation; and the RIADA of the ancient Iri&s;h writers.</P>
<P>But concerning this Riada, and his colony, the modern Iri&s;h authors were long mute. Stanihur&s;t, and others, who, at the end of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury, fir&s;t &s;uperficially treated Iri&s;h antiquities, had &s;een few or none of the old Iri&s;h MSS. then in private and unknown hands, till Sir James Ware collected them.

Keat|ing, who wrote about the &s;ame time, from the &s;ame motive, followed the &s;ame cour&s;e. Ware did not under&s;tand Iri&s;h; and his book is &s;o brief that it is not to be wondered that he &s;ays nothing of the origin of the Scots in Britain.

And, in his "Vindication of Ogygia again&s;t Sir G. Mackenzie," he in&s;i&s;ts that the Dalreudini were only &s;ettled in the north-ea&s;t corner of Ireland, till a part pa&s;&s;ed in 503 to Scotland. Still later Iri&s;h writers have, it is believed, in their prejudice again&s;t Scoti&s;h antiquity, followed the fame tract; but from the greater candour of others the truth has appeared in this century.</P>
<P>Kennedy, who&s;e book<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Genealogical Di&s;&s;ertation on the family of Stuart, 8vo. pp. 249.</NOTE> was publi&s;hed at Paris 1705, and tho brief, is the mo&s;t accurate known on Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, as he generally quotes MS. page, and column, fir&s;t laid open the fact, that a colony of Scots, under Riada, &s;ettled in Pikland. He tells us, p. 104, "Our books of antiquity, giving an account at large of the children and race of Conar Mac Mogalama king of Ireland, mention that he had three &s;ons, Carbre Mu&s;c, Carbre Ba&s;kin, and Carbre Riada: and that the fir&s;t was by another name Aengus; the &s;econd Olfill; and the third Eocha." And p. 107, "Our writers unanimou&s;ly tell us that Carbre Riada was the founder of the Scoti&s;h &s;overeignty in Britain; but they make him only a captain, as venerable Beda does, or conductor, who ingratiated him&s;elf &s;o
<PB N="63" REF="73">far with the Picts, by his and his childrens a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and good &s;ervice again&s;t the Britons; that they con&s;ented that they and their followers &s;hould continue among them." In both the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages he gives no authorities, tho he commonly pro|duces them.

<P>Mr. O'Conor, in his Di&s;&s;ertation on the Hi&s;|tory of Scotland, at the end of his Di&s;&s;ertations on the Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, Dublin, 1766, 8vo. is the next, and la&s;t, Iri&s;h writer whom i &s;hall quote upon this point. He there tells us, that in the time of Cormac O'Cuin, as O'Flaherty him&s;elf acknowleges <HI>Ogyg.</HI> part III. c. 69, an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Scots was made in North Britain. That it was in favour of Carbre Riada, a prince of the Degads<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>Kennedy, p. 69, &s;ays, this family was fir&s;t in Ul&s;ter: but about 60 years before Chri&s;t they were forced to more into Mun&s;ter, under Degad: whence they were called Degads of Mun&s;ter. This Degad, he adds, is the Deachach, in the old Scoti&s;h genealogies (Deaga, &s;ee Innes, p. 235, table.) it need not be ob&s;erved that all this is <HI>gratis dictum.</HI></P></NOTE> of Mun&s;ter, cou&s;in of Cormac O'Cuin, and &s;on of Conary II. who died in 220. That Riada and his immediate po&s;terity ruled that colony, as well as another which he had &s;et|tled in pre&s;ent Antrim, and both colonies were from him called <HI>Dalriada.</HI> That the Piks at length forced the whole colony in Britain to take flight into Ireland, under their leader Eochad Munrevar, and they &s;ettled in the Iri&s;h Dalriada. But nei|ther he, nor his &s;on Erc, could obtain a re-e&s;tab|li&s;hment in North Britain. Nor was it effected till the beginning of the &s;ixth century, when Loarn, &s;on of Erc, again fixed the Scots there. It appears from this, that the retreat of this fir&s;t
<PB N="64" REF="74">colony happened two generations before 503, or about 440.</P>
<P>Mr. O'Conor has, on different occa&s;ions, re|peated this information. In his publication of O'Flaherty's Vindication of Ogygia, Dublin, 1775, 8vo. he gives &s;everal notes concerning this &s;ettle|ment, but particularly a long one, p. 163. He there &s;hews that O'Flaherty is contradicting his own words in the Ogygia, where, &s;peaking of Cormac O'Cuin, he &s;ays, <HI>imperium in Albania exegit.</HI> That the greater part of Antrim, and a neighbouring part of North Britain, were given to Carbre Riada. That &s;ome Iri&s;h &s;enachies con|firm Beda's te&s;timony. That the Iri&s;h and Briti&s;h Dalriada were governed by the &s;ame family. That the &s;ons of Erc, in the eighth generation from Carbre Riada, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed this colony, which had &s;uffered much. That when Conary II. was murdered in 220, his three &s;ons were minors. That Carbre Riada, one of them, di&s;tingui&s;he him&s;elf at the battle of Kinfebrat, A. D. 237. That on Cormac's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Iri&s;h throne in 254, Carbre Riada was &s;ent again&s;t the Cruth|nii, who had rebelled in Ul&s;ter. That in 258 the war was carried into Albany, and the Scots &s;ettled there. And &s;ays that George III. de&s;cends from Conary thro Riada, and the Scoti&s;h Albanic line.</P>
<P>In the late <HI>Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis</HI> there are al&s;o &s;ome letters of Mr. O'Conor, throwing light on this &s;ubject. He tells us in one number<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Number X.</NOTE>, 'Foreign alliances were renewed, and in particu|lar with the Cruthenians (Piks) of North Britain, among whom our Carbry Riada, the &s;on of Co|nary II. found an e&s;tabli&s;hment for his colony of Scots, the fir&s;t that migrated from Ireland to North Britain." And in Number XII. p. 500, he &s;ays, 'About the year 256 Cormac O'Cuin, the mo&s;t
<PB N="65" REF="75">celebrated of our Iri&s;h monarchs, had his authority renounced by the Ultonians, the con&s;tant enemies of his family. After defeating tho&s;e rebels in &s;e|veral engagements, their remains fled for &s;helter into the i&s;les and continent of North Britain. Supplied with an excellent militia, di&s;ciplined un|der the famous Fin Mac Cumhall, his commander in chief, and his &s;on-in-law, Cormac fol|lowed his rebellious &s;ubjects into the places of their retreat. The terror of his power brought matters to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue. By con&s;ent, or force, he obtained from the Piks a &s;ettlement in Kintire and Argyle for his father's nephew Carbry Riada, above-mentioned. Through that colonization un|der his kin&s;man he left no foreign a&s;ylum open for his Ultonian enemies, who&s;e power in Ul&s;ter he al&s;o curtailed, by &s;tripping them of the territory now called the county of Antrim, with &s;ome con|tiguous di&s;tricts, well marked by U&s;her. That territory, as well as the other in North Britain, had the name of Dalriada, from Carbry Riada, their fir&s;t va&s;&s;al &s;overeign under the Iri&s;h monarch, who ve&s;ted him with authority<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Wynne, in his hi&s;tory of Ireland, London, 1773, 2 vols, 8vo. narrates the &s;ettlement of the Dalria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls in Pikland in the&s;e terms. "Among the &s;ons of Olliol Olum, there was one known by the di&s;tingui&s;hed name of Achy Ruada, or Riada, who was permitted by Olliol to rai&s;e a &s;ufficient body of forces to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in the province of Ul&s;ter. Fer+gus, then king of that territory, being of the family, fa|voured him, and his followers, who were of the race of De|gad: and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance Achy Riada procured, he &s;oon &s;ettled him&s;elf in Ul&s;ter, notwith&s;tanding all the oppo&s;ition of the Irians. And from this circum&s;tance the acqui&s;ition they made took the name of Dalriada, or the portion of Riada. But as Achy was one of tho&s;e that having much, &s;till gra&s;p at more, ob&s;erving a country over-again&s;t his di&s;|trict, which appeared ea&s;y of acce&s;s, he embarked with his followers; and, either by force or treaty, much more likely by the latter, he obtained a &s;ettlement there al&s;o for his tribe from the Briti&s;h Picts. And that tract of land was af|terwards, for many ages, denominated the Albanian Dal|r&igrave;ada, a name given to the inhabitants of Argyle, who were de&s;cended from this Iri&s;h colony." Wynne errs gro&s;sly in making Riada &s;on of Olliol Olum, for he was &s;on of Co|nary II. king of Ireland, as all the above accounts bear. And this is confirmed by an old piece, publi&s;hed by Innes, p. 772. "Fergus filius Eric ip&s;e fuit primus, qui de &s;e|mine Chonare," &amp;c.</P></NOTE>.'</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="76" MS="y">All this is given, as u&s;ual, without one autho|rity or reference! The circum&s;tances of Mr. O'Conor's tale are al&s;o di&s;cordant. Fir&s;t he &s;ays the &s;ettlement was owing to force; then he im|putes it to treaty; then to force again. Dr. Ken|nedy's account, tho brief, &s;eems much more ac|curate; and he imputes the &s;ettlement to the per|mi&s;&s;ion of the Piks. Common &s;en&s;e argues this to have been the ca&s;e, for that a handful of men, to whom fortre&s;&s;es were unknown, &s;hould force a &s;ettlement among &s;o fierce and numerous a people as the Piks, is impo&s;&s;ible. And even by Mr. O'Conor's account, when the Piks afterward quarreled with them, they totally expelled the colony. Mr. O'Conor's &s;tory about the rebellion of the Cruthini, or Piks in Ul&s;ter, &s;eems mere romance; and we have no room to believe that the&s;e Cruthini acknowleged the Iri&s;h &s;overeignty, or, in other words, that they could rebel. Tho&s;e Cruthini had only &s;ettled in Ul&s;ter about the year 220; and, far from being conquered or expelled on this occa&s;ion, we find them under their own monarchs till the eighth or ninth century. They were certainly not in Antrim, but in pre&s;ent Lon|donderry and Donegal. For the Iri&s;h Dalreudini po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Antrim, by Mr. O'Conor's own account; and at the &s;ame time he allows that the Cruthini were in the north of Ireland; and from Tighernac and the annals of Ul&s;ter, &amp;c. it is certain that the Cruthini were in a di&s;tinct region of Ireland from the Dalreudini. That the Cruthini were not on the north-ea&s;t of Ireland, but the north-we&s;t, al&s;o appears from Mr. O'Conor's own information, that
<PB N="67" REF="77" MS="y">he found in the old book of Glendalogh that the Cruthini were in Ul&s;ter and Connaught, which la&s;t province is on the we&s;t. There is but one people of Cruthini in Ireland, to be found in Adomnan, Tighernac, the annals of Ul&s;ter, and other authentic documents; and tho&s;e Cruthini were in part of Ul&s;ter, and part of Connaught by Mr. O'Conor's own relation, that is, on the north-we&s;t of Ireland. The people on the north-ea&s;t of Ire|land, among whom Riada planted his Dalreudini, were the Damnii or Darnii of Ptolemy, a Cum|raig people, that had pa&s;t from Scotland upon the arrival of the Piks. The Dalreudini, or tribe of Riada, were certainly led by him from Mun|&s;ter, his own province; and mu&s;t have been <HI>Scythae</HI> or <HI>Scotti,</HI> who had &s;ubdued the &s;outh, ea&s;t, and we&s;t of Ireland, but had not extended into the north, till Riada planted his colony. From the genuine writings of St. Patrick it is clear, as Innes remarks, that all the people of Ireland were not termed <HI>Scotti,</HI> but that the Scots were the &s;u|perior and conquering people, while the common &s;ubject race were termed merely <HI>Hiberni,</HI> or Iri&s;h. That the Dalreudini were Scots proper is certain from their being led from the South of Ireland, the chief region of the Scots; and from their be|ing termed Scots peculiarly by Adomnan, Beda, and other ancients. This account of the matter is &s;o con&s;onant to probability, that it would al|mo&s;t &s;upport it&s;elf, independent of all the ancient authorities, which are united in its favour. In|deed i have always found that the highe&s;t proba|bility and veri&s;imilitude ever attend the ancient authorities, when duly examined and collated.</P>
<P>It may be thought that Kennedy and O'Conor, writers of this century, are but poor &s;upports of Beda's authority. But it mu&s;t be reflected, that concerning the origin of the Dalreudini of Ireland, all the Iri&s;h writers, Keating, U&s;her, O'Flaherty, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. are concordant, and &s;ay the name
<PB N="68" REF="78">&s;prung from Carbry Riada. Beda, a &s;uperior authority to all the Iri&s;h annals put together, in|forms us, that this very Riada led al&s;o the fir&s;t co|lony of Scots to North Britain. So that the point &s;tands clear, independently of the lights which Kennedy and O'Conor throw upon it. This Carbry, or, as others call him, Eocha Riada, ap|pears in the old genealogy of the Scoti&s;h kings, repeated at the coronation of Alexander III. and pre&s;erved by Diceto, Fordun, and many others. In that genealogy he is termed <HI>Eodach Riede,</HI> and is placed twelve generations before Fergus &s;on of Erc. Kennedy informs us, that, tho the Scoti&s;h accounts thus put fourteen generations from Riada to Fergus (including both), yet the Iri&s;h and e&s;pecially the book of Lecan, give but ele|ven; that is, nine generations between the two, which, at thirty years to a generation, make 270 years. Mr. O'Conor &s;ays but eight, or 240 years, which is &s;urely the truth. Kennedy men|tions an Iri&s;h MS. which has but &s;ix: and &s;ays, that fal&s;e names creep into &s;uch genealogies, from mi&s;taking nicknames for proper names, and from putting names of predece&s;&s;ors as names of fathers; and &s;cruples not, upon this occa&s;ion, to &s;hew di&s;cordances in &s;cripture etymologies. It is mo&s;t &s;trange that O'Flaherty, in his genealogy of James II. gives only <HI>three</HI> generations between Riada and Erc! But that gentleman &s;eems to have paid little attention to facts or authorities, when his point was to abridge the antiquities of the Briti&s;h Scots, and to appropriate to the Iri&s;h all the actions of the Scots again&s;t the Romans. Which la&s;t purpo&s;e required no &s;uch aid, as it is certain that the Iri&s;h Scots are tho&s;e of Roman hi&s;tory; and the Briti&s;h Scots were only known under another name, of which pre&s;ently. But O'Flaherty de&s;erves reproof for u&s;ing fal&s;ifications, tho to &s;erve the cau&s;e of truth: <HI>Non tali auxilio.</HI> It is matter of regret, that the acute and accu|rate

<P>Thus the Iri&s;h in&s;erts two names, between Eocha Riada and Fiachra, not found in the Scoti&s;h; and likewi&s;e a Fergus Ulladh not in the Scoti&s;h. And the Scoti&s;h has eight names not in the Iri&s;h. The four la&s;t names are alone con|cordant. So much for Iri&s;h genealogies! It is remarkable that Angus Fir was cotemporary with St. Patrick, and that after him the genealogy &s;eems accurate. Before Patrick's time only the names of the kings of Ireland, and great events, can be received.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t writers on Briti&s;h antiquities have been puzzled to divine who the ATTACOTTI were; and none has hitherto &s;ettled this point. I am fully convinced that <HI>Attacotti</HI> was neither more nor le&s;s than the name given by the northern pro|vincial Britains, who were Cumraig, to the Dal|reudini. From the <HI>Dictionarium Kymbraicum</HI> of Davis it appears that <HI>At</HI> is <HI>ad; Attal</HI> is <HI>retinere, detinere,</HI> &amp;c. So that there is rea&s;on to conclude, that the name Attacotti means &s;imply <HI>Hither Scots,</HI> or <HI>Scots remaining</HI> in Britain. The <HI>S</HI> is quite a &s;ervile letter, &s;ometimes &s;uperfluous, &s;ometimes omitted, <HI>euphoniae cau&s;a,</HI> as all, the lea&s;t ver&s;t in the &s;truc|ture of languages, know. But this opinion receives full confirmation from other rea&s;ons. Ammianus Marcellinus fir&s;t mentions the Attacotti at the year 364. <HI>Picti, Saxone&s;que, et Scotti, et Atta|cotti, Britannos aerumnis vexavere continuis.</HI> And then at the year 368, <HI>Picti in duas gentes divi&s;i, Dicaledones et Vecturiones; itidemque Attacotti, belli|co&s;a hominum natio; et Scotti; per diver&s;a vagantes multa populabantur.</HI> And from St. Jerome we learn
<PB N="71" REF="81">that the Attacotti were a nation of Britain. Thus quite a new nation appears in Britain at this pe|riod. But how came it to e&s;cape the Roman writers for a whole century, from 258 till 364? The wonder would, it is pre&s;umed, have been greater, had this new colony appeared in Roman hi&s;tory &s;ooner. Hor&s;ley well ob&s;erves, that from the expedition of Severus 211, till Carau&s;ius 290, nothing concerning Britain can be found. And from 290 till 364, what have we? Only a hint or two of panegyri&s;ts, dealing wholly in generals. The fir&s;t books of Ammianus are mo&s;t unfortu|nately lo&s;t; &s;o that from 258 till 364 we have really no writer, from whom &s;uch information could be in the lea&s;t expected, either hi&s;torian or geographer. Ammianus, at the year 368, tells us he had given a de&s;cription of Britain, when de&s;cribing the actions of Con&s;tans there, about the year 342, &s;o &s;hall add no more. Then he proceeds to the &s;entence above quoted. It is therefore to be inferred, that as he &s;ays nothing at 368 of the Attacotti being quite a new nation, he had de&s;cribed them at 342: and in all proba|bility told us, as we are &s;till fully enabled to di&s;|cover, that they were a colony of the Scots who had come from Ireland, and &s;ettled on the north of the Glota, or Clyde. But the knowlege we have that the colony calling them&s;elves Dalreu|dini came to Britain about 258; and the mention of the Attacotti, a new nation in North Britain, only a century afterward, will of it&s;elf convince us that Attacotti was neither more nor le&s;s than the name given by the provincial Britons to the Dalreudini.</P>
<P>Richard of Cirence&s;ter, a monk of the four|teenth century, who is often palpably erroneous, is a writer to be cautiou&s;ly u&s;ed. To Ptolemy's map of North Britain, Richard has added the <HI>Attacotti,</HI> and <HI>Damnii Albani,</HI> nations unknown to Ptolemy; but is certainly right in their po&s;i|tion.

<PB N="72" REF="84" MS="y">He places the Attacotti on the north of the Frith of Clyde; and the Damnii Albani ju&s;t above them. And the&s;e two nations form the only addition he makes to Ptolemy's map. Now Beda places the Dalreudini, on their fir&s;t arrival, exactly in that very region. <HI>E&s;t autem &s;inus ma|ris permaximus, qui antiquitus gentem Britonum a Pictis &s;ecernebat: qui ab occidente in terras longo &s;patio erumpit; ubi e&s;t civitas Britonum muniti&s;&s;ima u&s;que hodie, quae vocatur Alcluith. Ad cujus vide|licet &s;inus partem &s;eptentrionalem Scotti, quos diximus, adven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">entes, &s;ibi locum patriae fecerunt.</HI> This is &s;urely a &s;trong confirmation that the Dalreudini and Attacotti were one and the &s;ame nation. The Damnii Albani of Richard were, it is likely, &s;ome of the Damnii of Antrim, conquered by Riada, whom he had tran&s;planted here along with his co|lony of Dalreudini. Albani is a well-known term for <HI>North Briti&s;h</HI> in the Iri&s;h tongue.</P>
<P>The Attacotti make a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in the <HI>Notitia Imperii,</HI> a work of the fifth century, where numerous bodies of them appear in the li&s;t of the Roman army. One body was in Illyricum, their en&s;ign a kind of mullet: another at Rome, their badge a circle: the <HI>Attacotti Honoriani</HI> were in Italy. In the &s;ame work are named bodies of Parthians, Sarmatae, Arabs, Franks, Saxons, &amp;c. Tho&s;e foreign &s;oldiers had, in all likelihood, be|longed to vanqui&s;hed armies; and been &s;pared from carnage on condition of bearing arms in tho&s;e of Rome. Some, it is likely, were merely foreign levies and auxiliaries. To which cla&s;s tho&s;e Attacotti belong, it is difficult to &s;ay. Cer|tain it is, that Theodo&s;ius, in 368, repelled the Piks, Scots, and Attacotti, from the Roman provinces in Britain; rebuilt the wall of Antoninus be|tween Forth and Clyde; and founded the pro|vince of Valentia. The Attacotti, finding no employment for their arms, might be tempted to enter into the Roman armies; for it was the Ro|man
<PB N="73" REF="85">policy in later ages to levy as many foreign troops as po&s;&s;ible, and to oppo&s;e barbarians to barbarians. Perhaps the Attacotti were &s;ubdued and forced to furni&s;h levies. Perhaps the&s;e bo|dies were pri&s;oners of war<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>Some imagine that the pre&s;ent Highland dre&s;s repre&s;ents the Roman military habit. The <HI>philibeg</HI> was always quite unknown among the Welch and Iri&s;h: but I know no Ro|man name for it. Among the Romans it was a mere orna|ment, or fringe, to the mail; and they wore <HI>braccoe,</HI> or breeches, under it. From old illuminated MSS. it appears to have been a dre&s;s of the people among the Saxons, who could not afford breeches. See Strutt's Antiquities. I be|lieve it al&s;o occurs on Trajan's pillar, as the dre&s;s of the common Daci, while the chiefs have <HI>braccoe.</HI> Its antiquity among the Highlanders is very que&s;tionable; and &s;ome &s;up|po&s;e it not older than Mary's reign. Gildas repre&s;ents both Piks and Scots of his time as quite naked, with only a piece of cloth tied about their middie. Giraldus Cambren&s;is mentions trou&s;ers as the Iri&s;h dre&s;s, A. D. 1180. Froi&s;&s;ard, tho amazed at the <HI>&s;auvages Ecoz&s;ons,</HI> as he calls them, takes no notice of this &s;triking peculiarity. Plaids are u&s;ed by the Wild Clans of Barbary: Shaw's Travels. Tartan is perhaps a late invention: and it is believed pa&s;&s;ed from the Lowlands to the Highlands. The Highland dre&s;s is not ancient, but &s;ingular, and adapted to their &s;avage life.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The time when the Attacottic colony arrived in Pikland, was certainly that in which flouri&s;hed the celebrated <HI>Fion Mac Cumhal</HI> (pronounce Fin Mac Cuwal) as all the Iri&s;h hi&s;torians agree: and therefore a few words &s;hall be added concerning that hero, who has had &s;o &s;ingular a fate in our time. In Scotland he is al&s;o called <HI>Fingal;</HI> and is mentioned under that name by Barbour in 1375: but this name is unknown to the Iri&s;h. That Fingal was the &s;ame per&s;on with the Iri&s;h Fin Mac Cuwal, is clear from the identic name of the father <HI>Cuwal,</HI> the &s;on <HI>Oi&s;in,</HI> the grand&s;on <HI>O&s;kir;</HI> and from the old Scoti&s;h poets, who &s;ometimes call this per&s;onage <HI>Fingal,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>Fin Mac Coul.</HI> The names of his companions Gaul, &s;on of Morni, &amp;c. al&s;o coincide both in Iri&s;h and Highland tradition; &s;o that the identity of Fin Mac Cuwal and Fingal is demon&s;trative.
<PB N="74" REF="86">But how the Scots alone came to term him Fin|gal, is not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;hewn. In the old Iri&s;h wri|ters, as Tighernac, the Annals of Ul&s;ter, &amp;c. <HI>Fingal,</HI> or <HI>White Strangers,</HI> is a name uniformly given to the Danes, and is not u&s;ed till their ap|pearance in 795; as Duf Gal, or Dugal, <HI>Black Strangers,</HI> is the peculiar name of the Norwegians. Mr. Thorkelin, a learned native of Iceland, in|forms me that the old dre&s;s of the Norwegians, and e&s;pecially of the pirates and mariners, was black; as the Icelandic is at this day, and has always been. But the Danes &s;eem to have been called Fingal, from the whitene&s;s of their com|plexions, while the Celts are of black complexion. The name Fingal, given to Fion, &s;eems therefore an impropriety, and a confu&s;ion (as tradition is &s;ynonymous with confu&s;ion) of the fame of the Fingals or Danes in Ireland, with that of Fin, the hero. The whole Iri&s;h and Highland poems and traditions, concerning this per&s;onage, form indeed one ma&s;s of confu&s;ion and ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>The period when Fin flouri&s;hed has, like other traditional matters, &s;uffered the gro&s;&s;e&s;t anachro|ni&s;ms. Later Iri&s;h MSS. and traditions, and poems, both of Ireland and the Highlands, re|pre&s;ent his &s;on Oi&s;in or O&s;&s;ian, as he is new chri&s;tened, as cotemporary with St. Patrick, A. D. 440, holding dialogues with that Saint, writing poems to him, &amp;c. But the real epoch of Fin preceded Saint Patrick near two centuries, as is clear from Iri&s;h hi&s;tory. He flouri&s;hed un|der Cormac O'Cuin, who a&s;cended the Iri&s;h throne in 254, as Mageogaghan 1627, Keating, O'Flaherty, Mac Curtin, O'Halloran, O'Conor, Warner, Wynne, and other writers, who mention Fin, &s;hew from the Iri&s;h annals. Colonel Val|lancey tells us, that at the memorable battle of Gabhra, A. D. 296, between Moghchorb king of Mun&s;ter, and Cairbre, &s;on of Cormac, king of Tara, mo&s;t of the &s;tanding army that had lately
<PB N="75" REF="87">been commanded by Fion Mac Cumbal, and its re|nowned heroes called Fiana Eirionn, or Phenians, were &s;lain, after va&s;t carnage of the enemy. O'Flaherty informs, that Fin died in 284; and under the year 291, &s;ays <HI>Praelium Gauranum prope Temoriam. "In praelii ae&s;tu Carbreus, et O&s;garus Fin|nii ex O&s;&s;ino nepos, manus con&s;erunt</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, Cat Ay&s;c. 4817, is a fine MS. of Mageoghagan's Hi&s;tory of Ireland, written in 1627, where, at the year 267, he &s;ays, "Fynne Mac Coyle, the great hun|ter, and defender of Ireland, beheaded." He gives a long fabulous account of him; and ob&s;erves that "O&s;gar Mac O&s;&s;yn, Fynn Mac Coyle's grandchild, was a valourous and hardy man.'</P></NOTE>, &amp;c. That Fin and Oi&s;in do not belong to Saint Patrick's time, is indeed clear from Tighernac, the Annals of Ul&s;ter, and other authentic documents. Jocelin, in his life of Saint Patrick, written in the twelfth century, places <HI>Finnan Mac Con,</HI> a giant, above a hundred years before Patrick. As to the ana|chroni&s;ms which have crept in, they are common in all traditions. Fin and Patrick were the two mo&s;t famous men of ancient Ireland; and they are thus brought together. Still greater anachro|ni&s;ms appear in the Northern Sagas, concerning Starkader, the Fin or Arthur of Scandinavia. Torfaeus, in his Norwegian hi&s;tory, has a di&s;&s;er|tation <HI>De Starkadis;</HI> and makes many out of one, whom Saxo repre&s;ents as living three centuries. Nay Torfaeus &s;ays there is no age from Chri&s;t's birth, to the eighth century, free from &s;ynchro|ni&s;ms of Starkader! Torfaeus, in the &s;ame work, vol. I. p. 296, is forced to &s;trive again&s;t the gro&s;s anachroni&s;m of a man, whom he puts in the fifth century, marrying Ragnar Lodbrog's daughter, who lived in the ninth! But &s;uch is tradition! Suhm, in his Ab&s;tract of Dani&s;h Hi&s;tory, makes two Starkaders, one in the fifth, the other in the eighth century; both of them great warriors and great poets. This re&s;embles the three Odins,
<PB N="76" REF="88">and is a mere apology for the anachroni&s;m of tra|dition. The mention of Starkader leads me to hint the great &s;imilarity between him and the Iri&s;h Fin and Oi&s;in; whence it is rea&s;onable to infer that the Danes and Norwegians in Ireland and Scotland, grafted many of the fables about Starkader on the &s;tory of Fin, Oi&s;in, &amp;c. Starka|der, like O&s;&s;ian, is not only an Achilles, but a Homer; not only a hero, but a great poet. As Fin and Oi&s;in are equally celebrated in Ireland, and the Highlands; &s;o Starkader, both in Den|mark and Sweden. Starkader was famous for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the oppre&s;&s;ed, &s;o Fin; ideas evidently of the times of chivalry. As Macpher&s;on makes his O&s;&s;ian an hi&s;torian of grave note; &s;o Saxo repre|&s;ents Starkader. Oi&s;in celebrates his own actions, &s;o Starkader<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P>Starkader anno&s;us poeta erat, et carmina ejus vetu&s;ti&s;&s;ima cen&s;entur eorum quae jam homines memoria tenent. <HI>Verel.

<P>Almo&s;t every nation has had a champion of this &s;ort: the Per&s;ians, Ru&s;tan; the Greeks, Hercules; the Scandinavians, Starkader; the Welch, Arthur; the Iri&s;h, Fin; the French, Charlemagne, &amp;c. Of the&s;e the Welch Arthur is now known to be a nonexi&s;tence, being only a Cumraig epithet <HI>Ard ur,</HI> 'The Great Man,' for Aurelius Ambro&s;ius, their Roman leader again&s;t the Saxons. And of the Iri&s;h Fin the le&s;s that is &s;aid in hi&s;tory the better; and the Iri&s;h antiquaries act judiciou&s;ly in this re&s;pect. He &s;eems however to have been a man of great talents for the age, and of celebrity in arms. His formation of a regular &s;tanding army trained to war, in which all the Iri&s;h accounts agree, &s;eems
<PB N="77" REF="89">to have been a rude imitation of the Roman le|gions in Britain. The idea, tho &s;imple enough, &s;hews prudence; for &s;uch a force alone could have copt with the Romans, had they invaded Ireland. But this machine, which &s;urprized a rude age, and &s;eems the ba&s;is of all Fin's fame, like &s;ome other great &s;chemes, only lived in its author, and expired &s;oon after him<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P>Buchanan, in his account of the family of Buchanan, Edin. 1723, 4to. gives an account of the Feans, or militia of Fin, and &s;peaks of 'rude rhimes,' on the actions of Fin Mac Coel, their general, as retained by the Iri&s;h, and Scoti&s;h Highlanders. This gentleman was well ver&s;ed in the Gaelic language.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the pretended poems of O&s;&s;ian, the &s;on of this Fin, it is almo&s;t beneath the purpo&s;e of this work to &s;peak. That &s;o &s;illy a delu&s;ion &s;hould impo&s;e even on &s;ome literati, both of England and Scotland, is only a proof how little hi&s;torical antiquities are &s;tudied in Britain: for in any other country only laughter could have followed. As to us of Scotland, foreigners &s;eem, on this occa|&s;ion, ju&s;tly to que&s;tion whether we be yet &s;avages or not. For that the mo&s;t civilized and benevo|lent manners &s;hould belong to &s;avage &s;ociety, as repre&s;ented in O&s;&s;ian, is not &s;o ab&s;urd as that &s;uch a delu&s;ion could impo&s;e on any, in a country advanced beyond a &s;avage &s;tate. National preju|dice is al&s;o a &s;pecies of madne&s;s, and con&s;umes all rea&s;oning and common &s;en&s;e; &s;o that people, rather acute on other points, will on this betray a credulity beneath childhood, and an obduracy beyond the pitch of confirmed frenzy. Certain it is, that, had the&s;e poems of O&s;&s;ian been publi&s;hed by an Iri&s;hman, all Scotland, from the Mull of Galloway to the Orkneys, would have been in one peal of laughter at &s;o enormous a <HI>bull.</HI></P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the&s;e poems form a literary phaenomenon, the mo&s;t &s;ingular that has ever appeared, or will, in all probability,
<PB N="78" REF="90">ever appear, in the world of literature. Their general manner is &s;uch, that it is no wonder they impo&s;e. When very young, and immer&s;t in Greek and Roman reading, i had a firm opinion of the fal&s;ehood of O&s;&s;ian's poems; becau&s;e it appeared, at fir&s;t glance, that their pre&s;ervation was an impo&s;&s;ible fiction. This was before i had redd them; but, upon peru&s;al, my &s;entiments to|tally changed. The intrin&s;ic &s;tyle and manner, and imagery of the poems, with the tran&s;lator's plau&s;ible notes, and the te&s;timonies given by Dr. Blair, a man of the mo&s;t excellent moral charac|ter, made me a complete convert; and from the age of &s;ixteen till twenty, their veracity appeared to me po&s;itive; any objections to it the mere ef|fect of envy, or of national prejudice. But be|ginning at la&s;t to &s;tudy the antiquities of modern nations, and of my own country in particular, i &s;oon awakened from &s;o gro&s;s a delu&s;ion; and was apt to conclude them the mere fabrications of the tran&s;lator, from the total ignorance even of the greate&s;t features of our hi&s;tory, and manners, that runs through the whole. I am convinced, there|fore, from my own experience, that as &s;oon as hi&s;torical antiquities, the mo&s;t manly and import|ant of all literary pur&s;uits, begin to be in the lea&s;t &s;tudied in Britain, the poems of O&s;&s;ian will be regarded in their true light of mere romance. But that they are totally the fabrications of the tran&s;lator, would be a ra&s;h conclu&s;ion; and tho i was led to think &s;o once, in my abhorrence of be|ing made a dupe, yet, upon full con&s;ideration of this point, i am convinced that one half, or per|haps more, of the&s;e poems is really traditional. For the poem of Fingal is mentioned as pre&s;erved by tradition in the Highlands, long before the tran&s;lation appeared. And Dr. Blair produces about an hundred re&s;pectable witne&s;&s;es to the tra|dition of other poems, and pa&s;&s;ages. But this very tradition will, to any impartial mind, pre|&s;ent
<PB N="79" REF="91">a clear proof that the original parts are of a late age. And it appears to me, that &s;ome poet, or poets, of &s;uperlative genius, flouri&s;hed in the Highlands of Scotland, in the Fourteenth or Fif|teenth century<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><P>The learned Murray, in the <HI>Novi Commentarii Societatis Gettingen&s;is,</HI> Gotting. 1771, 4to. laughs at Fingal and Te|mora; and thinks them productions of the XIIth or XIIIth century, under an ancient name, as Klop&s;tock gave his <HI>Bar|ditus.</HI> And he &s;hews, tom.

No; nor the ca&s;e of any other nation!</P></NOTE>; and from the total confu&s;ion of all hi&s;tory that pervades them. The tales of Fin, and his heroes, were always famous among the Iri&s;h, and their de&s;cendents the Scoti&s;h High|landers; as tho&s;e of Arthur among the Welch. Had a poet of &s;uperlative genius ari&s;en in Wales, at a late period, we might have &s;een as fine poetry, with a &s;imilar ignorance, and perver&s;ion of all hi&s;tory. Arthur would no doubt have fought in France, Ireland, &amp;c. and have been always victor. Had &s;uch a poet ari&s;en in Bretagne, Wales, the real region of Arthur, would have been re|pre&s;ented as the &s;cene of his conque&s;ts, as is the ca&s;e with O&s;&s;ian.

The fir&s;t of the&s;e arguments is non&s;en&s;e. The &s;econd fooli&s;h. The third utterly fal&s;e. Had
<PB N="80" REF="92">Oi&s;in, &s;on of Fin, and father of O&s;kir, compo&s;ed any poetry, this circum&s;tance could never have e&s;caped the whole Iri&s;h antiquaries. Any one the lea&s;t ver&s;t in the Gothic, or other poetry of the middle ages, mu&s;t know that nothing was &s;o u&s;ual as to compo&s;e poetry in the name of an eminent per&s;on. Lodbrog's death-&s;ong is one in|&s;tance of an hundred. Ario&s;to quotes Turpin as his author; and Cervantes has his Arabic autho|rity. Even in England, &s;o late as the end of the &s;ixteenth century, The Mirror of Magi&s;trates is wholly of this kind. This was a mere trick of the poet for greater effect; and to command re|verence. As Homer, and other poets, put their poetry into the mouth of a mu&s;e; &s;o the&s;e bards u&s;ed one or more eminent per&s;ons, by way of a mu&s;e. A poor Highland &s;troler, however great his genius, would never have commanded half &s;o much attention, to his own poetry, as he mu&s;t have done by imputing it all to the celebrated Oi&s;in, the &s;on of Fin. Literary forgery is by no means confined to enlightened periods; but is, on the contrary, the proper fruit of a dark pe|riod, and of an ignorant country; for in other periods and countries the light is too &s;trong.

<P>That there is no mention of Chri&s;tianity in the&s;e poems, is a fooli&s;h argument. By this argument few modern poets would belong to a Chri&s;tian period. Poetry has a machinery of its own in all countries. I have &s;een Icelandic poetry, writ|ten la&s;t year, in which the whole mythology of the Edda was kept up; as it is indeed always fol|lowed, &s;ave in hymns alone, by the Icelandic &s;kalds. Be&s;ides, the Norwegians, who &s;eized the Hebudes and we&s;t of Scotland, in the ninth cen|tury, were not Chri&s;tians; and their Celtic &s;ub|jects had no religion at all, but became utterly ignorant. But this que&s;tion is al&s;o in the hands of the tran&s;lator, who has altered the poems, put out Saint Patrick, and put in Caracalla. As the pieces are confe&s;&s;edly altered, how rea&s;on with ac|curacy upon &s;uch a fabrication? Suffice it to &s;ay, that <HI>granting</HI> there is no mention of Chri&s;tianity in the&s;e poems, any argument drawn from this would be as fooli&s;h, as to infer that the produc|tions of the Northern &s;kalds, were all written be|fore Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>As to the manners in this O&s;&s;ian, they are fal&s;e to exce&s;s, as are the whole hi&s;tory, geography, and chronology<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><P>Lord Kames, in his Sketches of the Hi&s;tory of Man, vol. I. has a long argument to prove the authenticity of O&s;|&s;ian. He, Dr. Blair, and one or two more really ingenious men, as Mr. Gray in England, do honour to that &s;ide of the que&s;tion. But i beg leave to a&s;k my reader, if he would take the advice of the&s;e gentlemen in any medical ca&s;e? And are not they ju&s;t as much phy&s;icians, as they are antiquaries? With want of knowlege of the Gaelic, it is as ridiculous to charge the antagoni&s;ts of O&s;&s;ian, as his defenders. The later confe&s;&s;edly have no &s;kill in the Gaelic; but argue upon ar|guments of fooli&s;h ingenuity. The que&s;tion is indeed of mere learning in antiquities, and freedom of mind. Lord Kames argues, that the manners of O&s;&s;ian belong to the hunting &s;tate, the earlie&s;t of &s;ociety; and that no late poet of the XVth century could have forged &s;uch manners. What forgery of manners? Were not the highlands in a hunting &s;tate of &s;ociety even in the XVIth century? The little or no mention of cattle, in O&s;&s;ian, only &s;hews the author's ignorance; for Dio tells us, that the Caledonians drove cattle and &s;heep in the way of the army of Severus, in order to draw parties into ambu&s;cades. But how argue upon pieces all altered by a modern tran&s;lator? Could any critic, in any age, rea&s;on accurately upon &s;uch a work from intrin&s;ic proofs? The noted mythology of O&s;&s;ian is in fact Norwegian. Odin in his magic, &s;t. 20, mentions the &s;hades of the dead flying over the trees: <HI>Runa Cap. apud Haavamal Re&s;enii.</HI> Is it not a plain fact, that not even a &s;hort poem ever was pre|&s;erved by tradition for more than three centuries, not a bal|lad? how then pre&s;erve long and numerous pieces for four|teen centuries? Is it not a plain fact that the language of every country becomes ob&s;olete thro time, even to the learned? how then can Gaelic of the third century be pre|&s;erved in the popular mouth? Is it not a plain fact, that Scot|land has no privileges from heaven above other countries; and that he mu&s;t be the dupe of his prejudices who can &s;uppo&s;e that the nature of human affairs is altered in Scot|land alone? Lord Kames ob&s;erves, 'One may venture boldly to affirm, that &s;uch a poem as Fingal, or Temora, never was compo&s;ed in any other part of the world, under &s;uch di&s;advantageous circum&s;tances.'

<PB N="83" REF="97">But ignorance is a &s;trange affair! The very name of Lochlin was unknown in Ireland, or the High|lands, till the ninth century, when the inva&s;ions of the Scandinavians began. The name means <HI>pirates;</HI> and Mr. M. puts it as a name of Scandi|navia. The name Fingal was never given to Fin by the Iri&s;h, or Highlanders. It was only applied to him by the Lowland Scots; and perhaps means Fin the Ga&euml;l, or Fin the Iri&s;hman, by eminence. The actions of Cuchullin, who lived in the fir&s;t century, are blended, in truly Celtic confu&s;ion, with tho&s;e of Fin in the third, and of the Fingal and Lochlin in the ninth and tenth. Moylena, in the King's County, is placed in Ul&s;ter: as is Temora, which is in Meath.

The car of Cuchul|lin has been regarded as a mark of ancient man|ners. But the Norwegians u&s;ed cars in the ninth century at the &s;iege of Paris; and they are believed to have been u&s;ed by them in Ireland, as in Scandinavia, down to the eleventh century. That they were u&s;ed by the Crutheni or Piks in Ire|land in the &s;ixth century, we know from Adom|nan. But, from the old tales, an Highland poet of the fifteenth century might ea&s;ily have de|&s;cribed a car; as modern poets de&s;cribe gonfanons, mail, and other ancient, but well known, features of war.

The manners of chivalry, gallantry to the women, and relieving the oppre&s;&s;ed, fill every page of O&s;&s;ian: and Fin, like king Arthur, is a perfect knight errant, &s;even centuries before knight-er|rantry was invented.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER III.</HI> The &s;econd arrival of the Ancient Scots in Britain, and fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Dalriadic Kingdom in <HI>503.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Dalreudini, or Attacotti, were, as has been hinted in the former chapter, repelled to Ireland in the middle of the fifth century, or about 200 years after their arrival. This event, pre&s;erved in Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, al&s;o appears from the Scoti&s;h accounts of Fordun, Major, Boyce, Bu|chanan, &amp;c. who all allow that the Scots were driven to Ireland; and, after a retreat of about fifty years, were re&s;tored by Fergus, &s;on of Erc. Gildas al&s;o &s;trongly implies this: &s;o that this in|cident may be regarded as fixt, and univer&s;ally allowed. But its preci&s;e epoch, and circum&s;tances, de&s;erve con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Gildas, after mentioning the letters of the Bri|tons to A&euml;tius, con&s;ul for the third time, that is in 446, tells us, that the Britons, in&s;tigated by de&s;pair, obtained a victory over the marauding Piks and Scots. That the Piks then remained quiet for a &s;ea&s;on; but the Iri&s;h returned home, not long after to return, <HI>revertuntur ergo impu|dentes gra&s;&s;atores Hiberni domum, po&s;t non multum temporis rever&s;uri.</HI> The he mentions the plague, which in 446 pervaded Europe; and the arrival of the Iutes in Kent, 449. Thus the date a&s;&s;igned by Gildas is 446. But as his authority only af|fords a &s;trong implication, it remains to confirm it by the Iri&s;h and Scoti&s;h accounts.</P>
<PB N="86" REF="102">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="87" REF="103">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<P><PB N="88" REF="104">The Iri&s;h account, as above &s;tated, bears that it was in the time of their leader Eochad Munre|var, father of Erc, father of Loarn and Fergus, who, in 503, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the Old Scots, that their retreat took place. That is, two genera|tions before 503, or about 60 years, which brings us to 440. But as in &s;uch ca&s;es the generations cannot afford the preci&s;e number, the Iri&s;h ac|count confirms the date given by Gildas of 446.</P>
<P>As to the Scoti&s;h account, it is &s;o perverted by the forgeries of Fordun, who places the expul&s;ion of the Scots in 360, and their re-e&s;tabli&s;hment by Erc's &s;ons in 403, that all that can be argued from it, is the duration of the expul&s;ion, which by this calculation is 43 years. He al&s;o quotes &s;ome old ver&s;es, which give this number. Of later Scoti&s;h hi&s;torians &s;ome enlarge this number, &s;ome dimini&s;h it. But &s;ufficient traces remain in our old writers to &s;hew the tradition of the ex|pul&s;ion; and that it la&s;ted forty, or fifty, or more years.</P>
<P>The epoch of this re-e&s;tabli&s;hment is &s;o marked and clear, that no part of ancient hi&s;tory can well be more certain. The period when Erc and his &s;ons flouri&s;hed, nay the year of the progre&s;s of the later to Pikland, and foundation of the Dal|riadic kingdom, will, to any one the lea&s;t ver&s;ed in Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, or our own old chronicles, illu&s;|trated by Innes, be as openly evinced as any date of Greek or Roman hi&s;tory. Nor is this circum|&s;tance to be wondered at, when the importance and latene&s;s of the event are con&s;idered. Mait|land, and &s;ome other weak and ignorant writers, per&s;i&s;t, in &s;pite of all truth, learning, and com|mon &s;en&s;e, to fix the reign of Fergus, &s;on of Erc, at 403, for two rea&s;ons: 1. Becau&s;e the Roman tran&s;actions again&s;t the Piks and Scots, cea&s;e about this time; and this date affords, therefore, a <HI>convenient</HI> chain of hi&s;tory. 2. Becau&s;e this date makes the Scoti&s;h kingdom more ancient than
<PB N="89" REF="105">tho&s;e of Spain, France, England, nay Ireland, which Maitland begins at Leogaire, the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian king. Thus the date 403 is very con|venient; and what is truth to a Scoti&s;h antiqui&s;t, who in the darkne&s;s of ignorance cannot even form an idea what the light of &s;cience is? Yet, A. D. 303, 203, or 403 years before Chri&s;t if you will, would be as proper a date for Erc's &s;ons, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Dalriadic king|dom, as 403. What would we &s;ay of a writer who, to &s;erve a fooli&s;h hypothe&s;is, &s;hould antedate the reign of any prince in Greek or Roman hi&s;|tory, a full century? The ca&s;e is as ab&s;urd here: for, after the Chri&s;tian period of Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, the events are as clear and po&s;itive, being &s;o late, as tho&s;e of any ancient hi&s;tory whatever.</P>
<P>Erc, the &s;on of Eochad Munrevar, is well known in Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, and flouri&s;hed toward the end of the fifth century. He died in 474. U&s;her has long ago told us, what &s;o many Iri&s;h writers have &s;ince repeated, that Tighernac, one of the mo&s;t &s;olid of the Iri&s;h annali&s;ts, and who wrote about 1080, &s;ays, that Fergus, &s;on of Erc, with the race Dalriada, held a part of Britain, and died there. This event he puts in the fir&s;t year of the pontificate of Symmachus, or 498<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tighernac's chronology is often wrong by five years, as the reader has &s;een in the former part, and will &s;ee in the cour&s;e of this work.</NOTE>. The author of the &s;ynchroni&s;ms, al&s;o quoted by U&s;her, puts this event twenty years after the battle of Ocha, where Ailil Molt, king of Ireland, fell A. D. 483, that is, in 503.</P>
<P>Two que&s;tions ari&s;e upon this &s;ubject. 1. Whe|ther the date 498, given by Tighernac, or 503 put by the author of the &s;ynchroni&s;ms, &s;hould be preferred? 2. If Loarn, or Fergus his younger bro|ther, was the fir&s;t king of Dalriada?</P>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="89" REF="107">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<P><PB N="90" REF="108">The fir&s;t que&s;tion is of &s;mall importance in an event of this nature, the difference being only five years. The author of the &s;ynchroni&s;ms is, by Mr. O'Conor, called Flan of Bute, and placed in the tenth century. The learned U&s;her calls him <HI>non novitius autor,</HI> 'no late author.' The que&s;tion therefore lies between him and Tighernac. The author of the &s;ynchroni&s;ms, by &s;uch extracts as are given of his work, appears a writer of con&s;i|derable learning and accuracy, who &s;tudiou&s;ly en|deavoured to &s;ettle the chronology of his country, by &s;ynchroni&s;ms of Roman emperors, &amp;c. And the date 503, given by him, is confirmed, as Innes &s;hews, by the number of years a&s;&s;igned in the old Scoti&s;h chronicles to the kings from Fer|gus to the death of Aidan, which by all accounts was in 605: namely, Fergus 3, Dongard 5, Con|gal 24, Gabran 22, Conal 14, Aidan 34, making ju&s;t 102 years; which, &s;ubtracted from 605, leave the date of the commencement of the Dalriadic kingdom, 503. This certainly turns the &s;cale in favour of the &s;ynchroni&s;ms. Mageoghagan, U&s;her, O'Flaherty, Kennedy, Innes, O'Conor, all a&s;&s;ent to this date of 503. As to the date 498, &s;uppo&s;ed to be put by Tighernac, it &s;eems doubt|ful if &s;o meant by the author; or if he, in other words, marks preci&s;ely the fir&s;t year of Symma|chus. For his dates are &s;ometimes wrong by four or five years; and U&s;her, who, in his <HI>Antiquitates Eccl. Brit.</HI> &s;ays that Tighernac mentions the fir&s;t Symmachus, in another place &s;ays, that he only puts this event, <HI>&s;ub initium pontificatus Symmachi.</HI> Symmachus &s;at from 498 till 514, or &s;ixteen years; and the year 503 would be toward the beginning of his pontificate. If &s;trictly interpreted, Tigher|nac would place the death of Fergus in the &s;ame year with his colony; for the words, <HI>et ibi mortuus e&s;t,</HI> would in regular annals imply this. But as it is well known, that this was not the ca&s;e, it may well be argued that Tighernac puts the date of
<PB N="91" REF="109">this event not to the preci&s;e fir&s;t year of Symma|chus, but toward the beginning of his pontificate; and 503 is toward the beginning of it, as it la&s;ted from 498 till 514.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider the &s;econd que&s;tion, or that concerning Loarn. In the Scoti&s;h accounts of Dalriadic kings Fergus begins the &s;eries; and Loarn is pa&s;t in oblivion, but in the Iri&s;h Loarn ranks as the fir&s;t king. Innes, who was afraid of offending his bigotted countrymen, and who pal|pably trembles when a&s;&s;erting plain truth and au|thority again&s;t ignorant prejudice and fal&s;ehood, pa&s;&s;es Loarn in utter &s;ilence; as he has pa&s;t the evidence for the retreat of the Scots from Al|bany to Ireland, in the fifth century. Strange that he &s;hould affront us &s;o far as to think that que&s;tions of plain matter of fact, and mere ma|thematical plea&s;ure, in other countries, &s;hould in Scoti&s;h antiquities, exclu&s;ively, be regarded as &s;acred to bigotry and frenzy! To him who looks on &s;uch que&s;tions with a due eye, they are points of mere curio&s;ity; and of no more concern or pre|judice than if they related to the hi&s;tory of Egypt, Macedon, China, or Peru. Neverthele&s;s let us beware of that common error of flying from one prejudice to another; and examine fairly whether Loarn or Fergus was really fir&s;t king of Dal|riada.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of the old Scoti&s;h li&s;ts upon this point is not to be wondered at, for they are to|tally erroneous and defective in other re&s;pects, as &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll pre&s;ently be &s;hewn, when we come to the chapter of Dalriadic kings. Tho&s;e petty princes were little regarded, even in their own domain: their future fabulous fortunes were unknown. The Piki&s;h monarchs were the kings of Scotland; and as &s;uch attracted all notice. The petty &s;overeigns of Argyle and Loarn were of &s;uch &s;mall account, that the only wonder is that any tolerable li&s;t of them is pre&s;erved at all. We have however no equal

But the Scoti&s;h li&s;ts are, after all, right, that Fer|gus was fir&s;t king of ALL Dalriada; for Loarn was only king of a part, while Fergus held the other, and, &s;ucceeding his brother, fir&s;t ruled the whole.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h accounts bear, that Loarn, Angus, and Fergus, three &s;ons of Erc, led the Scots back to Britain in 503. That Loarn was the fir&s;t king, and was &s;ucceeded by Fergus. What became of Angus we are not told. It would &s;eem that, either from incapacity, or preference of private life, he a&s;pired not to any &s;hare of the power of his brothers. But tho Loarn be left out of the regal li&s;t, in the Scoti&s;h accounts; yet neither he, nor Angus, are unknown in them. Fordun, lib. III. cap. 1. &s;ays, that Fergus, &s;on of Erc, came to Scotland, <HI>cum duobus fratribus Loarn et Tenegus,</HI> 'with his two brothers Loarn and Tene|gus,' which la&s;t word is a not uncommon corrup|tion of Angus with Fordun. The regi&s;ter of the priory of St. Andrew's, written about 1250, al&s;o &s;ays of Kenneth, &s;on of Alpin, <HI>&s;epultus in Yona in|&s;ula, ubi tres filii Erc, &s;cilicet Fergus, Loarn, et Enegus, &s;epulti fuerant;</HI> 'he was buried in Hyona, where the three &s;ons of Erc, namely, Fergus, Loarn, and Enegus, were buried.' And the Gae|lic poem, of Malcom the Third's time, puts Loarn as the fir&s;t king. Indeed we learn from Jocelin, a writer of the twelfth century, and who compiled his life of St. Patrick from more ancient authors, that Fergus was the <HI>younge&s;t</HI> &s;on of Erc; &s;o that the arrangement ought infallibly to be Loarn, Angus, and Fergus.</P>
<P>As to the Iri&s;h accounts, it is now perfectly known, from the works of O'Flaherty, Kennedy, O'Conor, &amp;c. that they put Loarn as fir&s;t king of Dalriada: and the Gaelic poem of Malcom the Third's time, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by the court-bard, as it is the mo&s;t ancient monument of
<PB N="93" REF="111">Dalriadic hi&s;tory remaining, de&s;erves the greate&s;t credit in this as in other points. The Highland Scots are allowed by their own late writers to have been an illiterate people. The celebrated mona&s;|tery of Hyona was &s;upplied from Ireland, which it always regarded as it's own parent country: and, being detached from Dalriada, had no effect on the character of the Highlanders. Ireland was, on the contrary, much noted for &s;uch learn|ing as was then in vogue. So that it is from the Iri&s;h writers that we mu&s;t expect genuine memo|rials of the Dalriadic kingdom; and the proxi|mity and identity of the Old Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h Scots, and con&s;tant intercour&s;e between them, lend the&s;e memorials every degree of authenticity and cre|dit. In any other hi&s;tory &s;uch te&s;timonials would bear no doubt; and it would be a mark of deplo|rable prejudice to weigh the hi&s;tory of Scotland in any other &s;cales than tho&s;e u&s;ed in that of any other country whatever. The early hi&s;tory of all barbaric &s;tates can only be gathered from writers of neighbouring nations; and the future authors of the&s;e barbaric countries have uniformly a&s;&s;ented to the&s;e foreign accounts: nor has any one ever attempted, &s;ave in Scotland alone, to overturn foreign authorities by no authority at all. Setting a&s;ide Greek and Roman authorities, where would be all the ancient hi&s;tory of Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa? The te&s;timony of Iri&s;h writers is not equal to that of Greek and Roman; but is certainly more than &s;ufficient for the early hi&s;tory of Dalriada, a petty Iri&s;h colony.</P>
<P>But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it &s;o happens, that there is no occa&s;ion for di&s;pute; for the Iri&s;h and Scoti&s;h accounts are mo&s;t ea&s;ily reconciled. Late Iri&s;h authors doubtle&s;s err in &s;uppo&s;ing Loarn fir&s;t SOLE king of Dalriada. He and Fergus were, in every appearance, joined kings, or rulers, of &s;epa|rate parts; the former of Lorn, which, as u&s;ual with Iri&s;h countries, retains his name; the later
<PB N="94" REF="112">of Argyle. Loarn of the northern part of Dalriada; Fergus of the &s;outhern. Upon the death of Loarn, without heirs male<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Perhaps Loarn left &s;ons, tho not come to maturity; and Fergus &s;eized the occa&s;ion of fixing the kingdom in his own family. The de&s;cendants of Loarn &s;ometimes held the Dal|riadic &s;ceptre, as &s;hewn chap. V.</NOTE>, Fergus acceded to his &s;hare; and was thus in fact fir&s;t king of Dalriada. This plain account, which reconciles all authorities, recommends it&s;elf by it's &s;implicity. The rea&s;on why Loarn is omitted in the Scoti&s;h li&s;ts, and ge|nealogi&s;ts, thus appears at once. From Tigher|nach it is clear that Fergus led a great part of the Dalriads to Britain, and that ancient writer does not even mention Loarn. Hence it appears that Fergus was a chief leader of this colony; and it is not probable that he would have yielded to the &s;ole &s;overeignty of his brother, who had done no more in the matter than him&s;elf. Thus even the Iri&s;h authorities concur to e&s;tabli&s;h this account. Loarn and Fergus were both advanced in life, when they proceeded to Britain.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER IV.</HI> Extent of the Kingdom of Dalriada.</HEAD>
<P>THE Dalreudini, or Attacotti, as above &s;hewn, were &s;eated on the north-we&s;t &s;ide of the Frith of Clyde, or in the &s;outh of pre&s;ent Argyle|&s;hire. From the figure which they make in hi&s;|tory, and in the <HI>Notitia,</HI> it is clear that they mu&s;t have been con&s;iderably numerous. At the &s;malle&s;t computation not le&s;s than ten thou&s;and effective men could infer the notice they attract; and &s;up|po&s;ing one man from each family, and each fa|mily to be of four per&s;ons, their population would thus amount to 40,000, or 50,000. Nor can more be granted from our knowlege of the territory they held; and from their being only denominated a <HI>Dal</HI> or <HI>Tribe,</HI> under one leader, Reuda, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>But on their return under Loarn and Fergus, in 503, their number &s;eems to have doubled that account. The former leader had the north part of pre&s;ent Argyle&s;hire, now called Lorn from his name. The <HI>Epidii</HI> are the only Caledonian, Piki&s;h, or Gothic, people placed in all this tract by Pto|lemy; and they were in Cantire, and the ile of <HI>Epidion,</HI> or Jura and Ila. The ile of Mull was al&s;o retained by the Piks; for in 565 Hyona, which is on the &s;outh of Mull, was given by the Piki&s;h monarch to Columba. The name Cantire is Gothic, but may have been given by the Nor|wegians, on their &s;eizing the Hebudes about the year 800. When this tract was ceded to the Dal|riads, &s;uch of the Epidii as chu&s;ed to remain, it
<PB N="96" REF="114">may be inferred, had that privilege; but were &s;oon lo&s;t in the new language of the colony.</P>
<P>Certain it is, from all the ancient te&s;timonies, that the kingdom of Dalriada, in the whole period of it's duration, or from 503 till 843, did not ex|ceed the limits of pre&s;ent Argyle&s;hire. This &s;mall territory is mountainous and barren; and it was no great gift to yield it to a colony of Scots, the old allies of the Piks. The ile of Mull, which fronts it's northern corner, and is flat, fertile and populous, the Piks retained; and it was alone worth all the re&s;t. In treating of the extent of the Piki&s;h dominions, the limits of Dalriada have been mentioned, and need not be here repeated. An ancient writer &s;ays, Fergus ruled the tract from Drum Albin to the Iri&s;h &s;ea, and Hebudes. Drum Albin is the highe&s;t part of Braidalbin, on the ea&s;t of Argyle&s;hire; and it is clear from Adomnan, that it was the ea&s;tern boundary of Dalriada, or the Old Scoti&s;h kingdom in Britain. The Frith of Clyde is well known to have been the &s;outhern; and the Iri&s;h &s;ea the we&s;tern. The northern boundary is not &s;o po&s;itive. Innes has not &s;ufficiently illu&s;trated this point. Winton con&s;iders old Argyle, as the whole of the Dalria|dic kingdom<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>So our old chronicles, publi&s;hed by Innes,
<Q>Primus in Ergadia Fergus rexit tribus annis.</Q>
and of Kenneth, 'Hic mira calliditate duxit Scotos de Ar|gadia in terram Pictorum.'</P></NOTE>; for, &s;peaking of Kenneth, the fabled conqueror of the Piks, he &s;ays,

<P>But it appears that Loch Linny was the northern boundary of Dalriada. For Mull remained to the
<PB N="97" REF="115">Piks<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>Walafrid Strabo, who wrote in the ninth century, puts Hyona as on the confines of the Piks:
<Q><L>In&s;ula Pictorum quaedam mon&s;tratur in oris,</L>
<L>Fluctivago &s;u&s;pen&s;a &s;alo, cognominis Eo.</L></Q>
This pa&s;&s;age is in his life of St. Blaithmac, who was &s;lain in Hyona by the Norwegians: <HI>apud Canis. Lect. Ant.</HI> tom. vi.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Dalriada certainly never extended over the Hebudes: as our old chronicles alone might evince, for they mark it as reaching from Drum Alban, or Brun-Alban, (<HI>Brun, pectus, collis,</HI> Old Germ. Gr. <GAP DESC="foreign">, Wachter.) on the ea&s;t; <HI>u&s;que ad mare Hiberniae, et ad Inch-Gall</HI> on the we&s;t. It no more included Inch-Gall, or the Hebudes, than it did the Iri&s;h &s;ea: it reached <HI>ad,</HI> not <HI>&s;upra.</HI></P></NOTE>; and it is not to be conceived that it was detached from their other dominions, but on the contrary mu&s;t have adjoined to them. So that Morven, and the re&s;t of that part of pre&s;ent Argyle&s;hire, which lies north of Loch Linny, was in every appearance po&s;&s;e&s;t by the Piks: as was the re&s;t of the north of Scotland. The name <HI>Loch-Aber</HI> given to the north-ea&s;t part of Argyle implies, i am told, <HI>The Lake of Strangers;</HI> and &s;eems to mark a limit; but on this nothing can be founded<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In the German language <HI>Haber</HI> is <HI>corn:</HI> in Scandinavian <HI>Ha&s;rar, avenae. Haber-dun,</HI> the Saxon name of a place in Bed|ford&s;hire, means <HI>Oatlands.</HI> Archaeol. VIII. 377. The Piks were an agricultural people; the Dalriads not: &s;o perhaps this may afford an argument, tho a trifling one.</NOTE>. It is to be regreted that tho&s;e an|cient pieces which mark Drum Alban, and the Iri&s;h &s;ea, as the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern bounds of Albany, did not al&s;o affix the northern bound; for as to the &s;outhern it is perfectly known to have been the Frith of Clyde. But to any one who ca&s;ts an eye upon the map of Scotland, Loch Linny will appear the only grand boundary which could be a&s;&s;igned on the north of the Dal|riadic territory; and it is connected with other lakes which inter&s;ect the country to Inverne&s;s. This was the limit of Ve&s;pa&s;iana; and is now marked with a chain of forts, William, Augu&s;|tus, and George. Beyond this, on the north-we&s;t
<PB N="98" REF="116">of Scotland, there are only &s;mall creeks and crowded hills, which afford no grand natural boundary. The old de&s;cription of Scotland, &s;up|po&s;ed to be by Giraldus Cambren&s;is; and Win|ton, with other ancient accounts, unanimou&s;ly mark Argyle as the Dalriadic kingdom. The Piks certainly held Hyona; and of cour&s;e Mull and the adjacent northern coa&s;t. For all the&s;e rea&s;ons it &s;eems certain that Loch Linny was the grand and natural boundary of Dalriada on the north.</P>
<P>The charter of the earldom of Moray, publi&s;hed by Home, Lord Kaims, in his E&s;&s;ays on Briti&s;h Antiquities, and in Shaw's Moray, throws &s;ome light on the old limits of Argyle. This great earldom or province of Moray included pre&s;ent Elgin&s;hire, Nairn-&s;hire and Inverne&s;s-&s;hire: ex|tending on the north in the words of the Charter <HI>per mare u&s;que ad marchias boreales Ergadiae quae e&s;t comitis de Ros:</HI> Glenelg, or that part of Inverne&s;s-&s;hire which borders on Ro&s;s on the We&s;t, being in|cluded in Moray. Thus it would &s;eem that in the fourteenth century Argyle extended even to Ro&s;s-&s;hire. Yet in Gordon of Straloch's maps Argyle is re&s;tricted to the &s;outh of Lorn, and of Loch Aw. From the <HI>De&s;criptio Albaniae,</HI> pub|li&s;hed by Innes, it al&s;o appears that in the 12th century <HI>Argathelia</HI> was regarded as a large pro|vince. But this impropriety aro&s;e after the Nor|wegians &s;ettled in the north and we&s;t of Scot|land in the ninth century; and it is clear from Tighernac, and other early writers, that Lorn was a di&s;tinct province from Argyle: and the later was on the &s;outh of it, as Gordon of Stra|loch's maps rightly bear. From the <HI>De&s;criptio Albaniae</HI> it appears that <HI>Argathelia</HI> was all the country held by the Gatheli, Gael, or Iri&s;h; and thus &s;eems different from the <HI>Argal</HI> of Tigher|nac. But both being tran&s;lated Argyle, confu&s;ion aro&s;e. There is however no proof that the Gael
<PB N="99" REF="117">extended up to Ro&s;s &s;hire, before the Norwegians &s;eized on the Hebudes; &s;o that the limits of Dal|riada<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">This name of Dalriada continued to the time of Kenneth &s;on of Alpin at lea&s;t, as appears from the old chronicle, Innes, App. No. III. p. 783, which, &s;peaking of that king, &s;ays, "I&s;te vero, biennio antequam veniret Pictaviam, DAL|RIETAE regnum &s;u&s;cepit."</NOTE> have nothing to do with tho&s;e of Arga|thelia.</P>

<P>IT is &s;urprizing that Innes, who has publi&s;hed the genuine old li&s;ts of the kings in North Britain, as pre&s;erved in Scoti&s;h manu&s;cripts, has given us no chronologic remarks on the dates of their re&s;pective reigns. The Piki&s;h &s;eries he has arranged; but has left the Dalriadic, not &s;eem|ing even to &s;u&s;pect the difficulties attending it, or perhaps afraid of offending weak brethren by &s;hewing it's inaccuracy. The Dalriadic &s;eries, as dige&s;ted by O'Flaherty, with &s;ome care and fide|lity, from the olde&s;t monument on the &s;ubject, the poem a&s;cribed to Malcom the Third's bard, and &s;upported by the Annals of Ul&s;ter, Tighernac, and others of the mo&s;t veracious Iri&s;h te&s;timonies, Innes has pa&s;t in total &s;ilence. Yet the Scoti&s;h li&s;ts, compared with that of O'Flaherty, are mo&s;t inaccurate, and liable to &s;trong objections. And it is in fact from Ireland alone that we are to look for genuine intelligence on this trifling &s;ubject of the Dalriadic kings, as above &s;hewn. But when we find this intelligence re&s;ting on the olde&s;t Scoti&s;h monument, the poem of Malcom's time, it is ra&s;h to oppo&s;e it; and to pa&s;s it in &s;ilence, as Innes has done, is &s;till wor&s;e. Indeed, when Innes wrote, much of the old leaven of fabulous frenzy, and childi&s;h prejudice, remained in Scot|land: and it is no wonder that he &s;hunned telling us that our own li&s;ts of our dear kings of Argyle are inaccurate; and that the Iri&s;h accounts are far &s;uperior. But as every reader mu&s;t already have &s;een that the Piki&s;h &s;eries is that of the kings of
<PB N="101" REF="119">Scotland, down to 843 at lea&s;t, if not after; this line of Dalriadic princes becomes of no more importance, than that of &s;o many Dukes of Ar|gyle. Such being the ca&s;e; and philo&s;ophy mak|ing daily progre&s;s in Scotland; it is pre&s;umed little or no bigotry remains on this &s;ubject: and it is hoped that every &s;en&s;ible reader will approve my treating it with perfect freedom, as i can &s;afely &s;ay that my earne&s;t wi&s;h is to de&s;pi&s;e all prejudice and timidity, while a&s;&s;erting the cau&s;e of truth, which is that of my country; for fal&s;hood is the greate&s;t di&s;honour that any country, or indivi|dual, can undergo.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Dalriadic kings extends from 503 till 843, when Kenneth a&s;cended the Pik|i&s;h throne. For this period of 340 years, the old Latin li&s;ts a&s;&s;ign twenty-four kings, including Kenneth. The Albanic Duan gives thirty-four. So that the difference amounts to no le&s;s than TEN kings.</P>
<P>It has been mentioned above, when treating of the Piki&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that from the li&s;ts of Iri&s;h monarchs, and of the Piki&s;h, and of the heptarchic kings in England, not more than eleven years each fall to any &s;eries of barbaric monarchs in the north of Europe. Sir I&s;aac Newton has &s;hewn that eighteen years form the medium in great and civilized kingdoms; but in &s;mall barbaric kingdoms it is clear, from facts as well as philo|&s;ophy, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is above one-third more rapid; and eleven years form the medium<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gibbon ob&s;erves, vol. V. p. 89, 4to ed. that, in the Byzantine empire, 60 emperors fill 600 years: a proportion, he adds, far below Newton's rule.</NOTE>. Now 24 kings, at 11 years each, give but 264 years in&s;tead of 340. And it is perfectly known that the Dalriadic kings were engaged in con&s;tant wars, and di&s;&s;entions, above any, either in Britain or Ireland; &s;o that, in&s;tead of granting them longer reigns than the neighbouring princes, it is

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="101" REF="121">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="102" REF="122">but fair to a&s;&s;ign them rather &s;horter. If we put them therefore at ten years a-piece, the reigns of thirty-four kings will ju&s;t fill 340 years, or an|&s;wer the Albanic account. Kenneth's reign al&s;o extended more than a dozen of years beyond 843, &s;o that 34 kings &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary, upon general chronologic principles, to fill the &s;pace of time. But 24 kings for more than 350 years would give about 15 years a-piece; and form a &s;triking and ab&s;urd exception to the Iri&s;h, Piki&s;h, and Hep|tarchic li&s;ts. This argument becomes &s;o cogent as to be invincible, when we con&s;ider that by all accounts the clear and certain li&s;t, from Kenneth's acce&s;&s;ion to the Piki&s;h throne, 843, till the death of Lulach 1054, contains no le&s;s than eighteen kings in 211 years. Which is but between eleven and twelve years for each king. If this was the ca&s;e, when the di&s;&s;entions of the Piks and Dal|riads being at an end, one grand cau&s;e of the &s;hortne&s;s of the Dalriadic reigns had cea&s;ed; and the kings po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed ample power and &s;ecurity; it is &s;urely rea&s;onable to infer, that the reigns pre|ceding that date mu&s;t have been &s;horter, in&s;tead of &s;o much longer as to amount to 15 years at a medium.</P>
<P>But over and above this plea, deduced from the &s;ounde&s;t rules and philo&s;ophy of chronology, the preference due to the Gaelic li&s;t is clear, be|cau&s;e that li&s;t corre&s;ponds with dates pre&s;erved in authentic Iri&s;h Annals, and is in it&s;elf &s;ufficiently exact, while the Latin li&s;ts are totally ab&s;urd<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See them in Innes's Appendix.</NOTE>.

Fada is al&s;o put before Malduin, in defiance of the old li&s;ts, both Iri&s;h and Scoti&s;h. Eochod is again fal&s;ely tran&s;lated Eugenius: and a fal&s;e Euge|nius V. is interpolated, equally unknown both to the Iri&s;h and Scoti&s;h accounts. Ed Fin is placed before Eogan, again&s;t the &s;ame authentic cata|logues. And a fal&s;e Convallus is interpolated.
<PB N="105" REF="125">The cau&s;e of interpolating kings is &s;elf-apparent, namely, to &s;well the li&s;t, and bring it into &s;ome conformity with chronology: and Fordun's power of creating kings is too well known. But what purpo&s;e that ignorant dreamer had in view, by merely altering po&s;itions of kings, and putting the la&s;t fir&s;t, is not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;een. This flaw &s;eems indeed to have &s;prung merely from an ex|traordinary talent for blundering: or to &s;hew us that our hi&s;tory was all his own, and he would u&s;e it as he plea&s;ed. But as he was &s;trong, he &s;hould have been merciful; and not have in|&s;ulted us by &s;uch a di&s;play of power, only equalled in the Rehear&s;al,</P>
<P>And all this I &s;hall do, becau&s;e I dare.</P>
<P>The fal&s;ehood of Fordun's li&s;t is al&s;o clear from it's chronology. Connad Keir died in 630, as Tig|hernac &s;ays: Fordun places his death in 605. Amkellach was &s;lain in 719, according to the Iri&s;h annals: Fordun puts 698. Selvac is often mentioned in the&s;e annals at 719, &amp;c. Fordun dates him 766. The&s;e glaring faults, perver&s;ions, and interpolations, render his authority as un|tenable in this part, as Innes has &s;hewn it to be in the former; and the character of Fordun, now &s;o well known as a gro&s;s forger, and fal&s;ificator, &s;ets the due &s;eal to his evidence. He had palpa|bly never &s;een the Albanic Duan, nor the Iri&s;h accounts. All he does is to alter and interpolate the old Latin li&s;ts, pre&s;erved in the Regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's, and other repo&s;itories; and pub|li&s;hed by Innes.</P>
<P>Fordun's li&s;t, followed by all our writers to this day, is indeed the utmo&s;t perfection of hi&s;to|rical fal&s;ehood; for it is a fal&s;ification of the old Latin li&s;ts, which are them&s;elves fal&s;e. It is a &s;uperfetation of fal&s;ehood: fal&s;ehood again fal|&s;ified. For the defects of the old Latin li&s;ts are &s;o great as to &s;tamp them with utter fal&s;ehood on the whole chronology in gro&s;s, as above &s;hewn.
<PB N="106" REF="126">Their particular chronology is no le&s;s erroneous. Connad Keir died in 630: the li&s;ts put 621. Amkellach died 719: the li&s;ts &s;ay 692. Selvac began to reign 719: the li&s;ts date 744. Murdac began his reign 733: the li&s;ts &s;ay 705. And the well-known reign of Kenneth, who a&s;cended the Piki&s;h throne, is antedated by the&s;e old li&s;ts near thirty year!</P>
<P>Fordun's li&s;t, blindly followed by Major, Boyce, Le&s;ly, Buchanan, and to our own times by Maitland, Guthrie, and other dablers in our hi&s;tory, being &s;o totally fal&s;e and erroneous, as to be out of the que&s;tion; the only point that re|mained was whether the Latin or Gaelic li&s;t de|&s;erved preference. The Piki&s;h &s;eries, in the e&s;&s;en|tial parts of which, as might be expected from it's importance, all Iri&s;h, Scoti&s;h, and Engli&s;h accounts, agree, as formerly &s;hewn, is that of the kings of Scotland till 843. The Dalriadic &s;eries of kings of Argyle was &s;o unimportant, that it is &s;urprizing that any tolerable li&s;t is extant. In fact, the whole &s;eries &s;tands upon one poem, which is now printed in the Appendix, from a tran&s;cript remitted to me by Mr. O'Conor. This poem bears in its conclu&s;ion that it was written in the time of Malcom III. 1056&mdash;1093<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>The original of this piece is &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the P&s;altar Ca&s;hail.

O'Flaherty rightly drew the whole &s;eries from it: and he, and others mo&s;t &s;killed in the Iri&s;h lan|guage, have ever regarded it's authenticity as un|que&s;tionable. It is believed to have been written by the Highland court-bard of Malcom III. and
<PB N="107" REF="127">has no marks of having been written in Ireland. The beginning of this celebrated Duan, or &s;hort poem, is,
<Q><L>A eolcha Alban uile,</L>
<L>A &s;hluagh feta foltbhuidle,</L>
<L>Cia ceud ghabhail aneol duibh,</L>
<L>Ro ghabh&s;adar Alban bruigh.</L></Q></P>
<P>Ye &s;killful men of Alba, ye comely ho&s;ts of the yellow tre&s;&s;es, know ye the fir&s;t tribes who po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed Albanian lands? Then the bard gives us the fable of Albanus and Brittus, from Nennius, who wrote in 858, knowing nothing of Locrine, Alba|nactus, and Camber, &s;ons of Brutus, as Geoffrey fabled about 1150. Next he mentions that the Nemedians, under Erglan, &s;ettled in Albany, af|ter the &s;iege of Tor Conang (in Donegal), which is a fable like the former. He then proceeds to the Cruthni, or Piks; and &s;tates, in conformity with the Iri&s;h annals, that &s;eventy kings reigned in Pikland before Con&s;tantine. Next he puts the colony of Riada, de&s;cended from Conary, king of Ireland; and &s;ays, that 'in later time,' the three &s;ons of Erc, Loarn, Fergus, and Angus, came over. After which follows the lift of kings from Loarn and Fergus, down to Malcom III. with the number of years they reigned. This Duan, be&s;ides its hi&s;torical merit, is al&s;o valuable for its curio&s;ity, as an ancient &s;pecimen of tho&s;e metrical li&s;ts of kings, which &s;upplied the place of hi&s;tory in illiterate countries, as explained in treating of the Piki&s;h li&s;ts. Among the olde&s;t monuments of our hi&s;tory is a metrical piece in Latin, written in the thirteenth century, in ele|giac mea&s;ure, only beginning with Kenneth, 843. But this Duan is more valuable from it's being older by two centuries; and that Latin piece is evidently on the model of tho&s;e u&s;ed in the vulgar idiom, before Latin was in &s;uch general u&s;e.
<PB N="108" REF="128">Without this old Gaelic Duan no &s;eries of the princes of Dalriada could have been given; for many of them are not found either in the Latin li&s;ts, or in the Iri&s;h Annals. Both the Latin li&s;ts and Iri&s;h Annals, however, concur to certify this Duan; and lend it every degree of hi&s;toric faith. Indeed, as the mo&s;t ancient piece of Dalriadic hi&s;tory pre&s;erved by near two cen|turies, this Duan would by every rule of hi&s;toric authority have merited the preference, indepen|dently of other con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>There is, however, a circum&s;tance relating to this old poem, with which it is proper that the reader &s;hould be acquainted. The part of it which contains the kings after Kenneth, &s;on of Alpin, down to Malcom III. tho exact enough in the names and order, is yet very defective in the number of years it a&s;&s;igns to mo&s;t of the reigns. Thus to Kenneth III. it gives 30 years, tho he only reigned 16: to Con&s;tantine II. the like num|ber of 30 years, tho he al&s;o reigned but 16: to Ed 2 years, for 1: to Donal II. 5, for 11: to Con&s;tantin III. 46, for 40: to Malcom I. 4, for 9: to Odo or Duf 7, for 5: to Kenneth IV. 27, for 24: to Con&s;tantin IV. 7, for 1: to Grim 4, for 8. This chronology would carry the be|ginning of Macbeth's reign down to the year 1055, in defiance of all our chronicles, and of the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h hi&s;torians. Nor can there be a doubt that it is totally erroneous thro-out this part.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h antiquaries therefor agree that this later part is corrupted, and added by &s;ome igno|rant hand to the former, which they depend on as exact. But upon con&s;ulting one or two per&s;ons well &s;killed in the Iri&s;h language, i am informed that the &s;tyle of this later part is identically the &s;ame with that of the former; and i am perfectly convinced that the whole piece is written by one hand; but that the Iri&s;h antiquaries a&s;&s;ert the con|trary,
<PB N="109" REF="129">merely becau&s;e they find this later part un|tenable, as in the years a&s;&s;igned it contradicts the be&s;t and mo&s;t numerous authorities. In&s;tead there|for of granting that the years of the former part may be as erroneous as tho&s;e of the later, they at|tempt to pa&s;s this la&s;t part as a corrupt addition, that they may &s;ave the credit of the former. But it is certain that the years in the fir&s;t part often di&s;agree with tho&s;e of Tighernac; and &s;eem fully as uncertain as tho&s;e of the la&s;t.</P>
<P>It therefor appears that the bard who wrote this poem, tho right in the names and order, which he mu&s;t have had from older poems, yet as he probably fir&s;t thought of giving the years in his ver&s;e, he had not good authorities for the&s;e years; but has given them much at random from begin|ning to end. And as our old Latin li&s;ts are cer|tainly far more exact in the later part, as to the&s;e years, &s;o it is but rea&s;onable to infer that they are al&s;o more exact in the former. The names and order of the kings were duly repeated by the bards at coronations; but the number of years they reign|ed appears not to have been recited on the&s;e occa|&s;ions, and were out of the bard's province. Our old li&s;ts, pre&s;erved in the Ma&s;s-books, &amp;c. are therefor much more to be credited, as to the num|ber of the&s;e years; for numbers take le&s;s hold of the memory than any objects whatever, and are of cour&s;e the lea&s;t to be tru&s;ted, of all traditional mat|ters. The be&s;t plan of cour&s;e appeared to be, to follow the bard in names and order; but to check his numbers from our old li&s;ts; the Iri&s;h Annals; and arguments from the nature of the &s;ubject. It will not indeed be &s;urprizing if the reader &s;hould find the li&s;t of Dalriadic kings, which has co&s;t the author more labour than any part of this work, the mo&s;t un&s;atisfactory part of it. The Piki&s;h Chro|nicle of the Kings of North Britain was clear and ea&s;y; but to adju&s;t the ob&s;cure &s;eries of Dalriadic kings is no le&s;s difficult than it is unimportant.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="130">The reader will, however, it is hoped, allow that the &s;eries of Dalriadic kings, pre&s;erved in this Gaelic Duan, de&s;erves the preference over the old Scoti&s;h li&s;ts in Latin, for the cau&s;es above de|tailed: to wit,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the number of Thirty|four kings, given in the Duan, is conformable to the general chronology of the neighbouring bar|baric kingdoms, which allows but ten or eleven years for each king; whereas, Twenty-four would allow fifteen: and there is every rea&s;on to infer that the Dalriadic kings reigned even a &s;horter &s;pace in general, than tho&s;e of England, Pikland, or Ireland. Nay, in the real &s;eries after Kenneth, till Malcom III. the later part of tho&s;e very Latin li&s;ts gives but between eleven and twelve years for each king; tho in enlarged power and &s;ecurity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the old Latin li&s;ts are &s;o deficient in general chronology, that they want near thirty years of the period, which they pretend to reach at the commencement of Kenneth's reign in Pikland.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the old Latin li&s;ts are al&s;o quite deficient in particular chronology, as is clear from dates pre&s;erved in the authentic Iri&s;h Annals, which are right as to the kings of Pikland, and the Engli&s;h Heptarchy, and cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed wrong as to tho&s;e of Dalriada alone; about whom, on the contrary, their intelligence mu&s;t have been be&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That the Duan is more ancient by two centuries than any Latin li&s;t pre&s;erved, and in this re&s;pect alone would, by every rule of hi&s;tory, de&s;erve &s;uperior faith. The antiquity of the Duan admits of no doubt, being judged of by the very &s;ame rule followed concerning the Latin li&s;ts, namely, that it was written under the king with whom it ends, and the length of who&s;e reign it therefore &s;ays was only known to heaven.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Let us, therefore, proceed to dige&s;t the genuine &s;eries of Dalriadic kings from that Duan. Mr. O'Flaherty, who&s;e accuracy and fidelity in later events, and real hi&s;tory, are rendered &s;u&s;picious
<PB N="111" REF="131">by his notorious credulity in fabulous periods, has with much care preceded me in this labour. His Dalriadic &s;eries is in fact the be&s;t part of his work, for here he was a &s;pectator, and not a party. <HI>Si &s;ic omnia!</HI> But i &s;hall beg leave to differ from him in many points; and as his authorities, namely, the Gaelic Duan, with a literal tran&s;lation, and extracts from the tran&s;lation of the Annals of Ul&s;ter in the Mu&s;aeum, are now on my table, i hope i &s;hall not be blamed for u&s;ing my own eyes and thoughts. It mu&s;t be premi&s;ed that the An|nals of Ul&s;ter &s;eem accurate in Iri&s;h affairs; as ap|pears from the eclip&s;es they mention; which, upon compari&s;on with the chronology of eclip&s;es, in <HI>L' Art de Verifier les Dates,</HI> i have never found to differ above one year. But in foreign affairs, as the actions and deaths of Engli&s;h, Piki&s;h, and Dalriadic monarchs, there are mi&s;takes from three to &s;ix years, &s;ometimes antedated, &s;ome|times po&s;t-dated. The years are right (allowing one year, as Ware does, for the difference in beginning the year), but foreign actions are often referred to wrong years, tho &s;ometimes al&s;o right.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Loarn, Fergus,</HI> &s;ons of Erc, reigned together, as <HI>Loarn, Fergus,</HI> above explained. This reign began in 503. The Duan &s;ays Loarn reigned 10 years. But had he reigned &s;o long, it is unaccountable that his name &s;hould have been omitted in our li&s;ts. Both he and Fergus were very old, when they came to Dalriada; and Tighernac &s;peaks of Fergus as dying after a &s;hort reign. Loarn's reign could hardly exceed one year. Muredach, &s;on of An|gus, another brother of Loarn, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the iland Ilay: <HI>O'Fl.</HI> Erca, daughter of Loarn<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The Chronicon Rythmicum, Innes, p. 808, bears that one <HI>Lori</HI> led the Scots to Argyle; and Innes is puzzled to divine who Lori is.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Gabran,</HI> &s;on of Domangard, A. C. 545. In this reign there is the greate&s;t difference be|tween the Duan and the Latin li&s;ts; the former giving but two years, the later twenty two. The Annals of Ul&s;ter date Congal's death, 544: Gabran's, 560; and &s;o a&s;&s;ign him 16 years. Tig|hernac, at the year 560, &s;ays, <HI>Mors Gaurani filii Domangardi, et Albadi, a Brudeo filio Milchuonis, Rege Pictorum, in fugam conver&s;i; Dermitio rege

<P N="6">6. <HI>Conal</HI> I. &s;on of Congal, &s;ucceeded his uncle, A. C. 560, and reigned fifteen years, <HI>Duan:</HI> four|teen, according to the old li&s;ts. The Annals of Ul&s;ter and Tighernac &s;ay, that he gave Hyona to Columba 565: but Beda, a far more ancient and better informed writer, &s;ays, that the Piks gave that ile to Columba, as above explained. The words in the Ul&s;ter Annals, under 573, are, <HI>Mors Conail Mac Comgail anno regni &s;ui</HI> 16. <HI>qui ob|tulit in&s;ulam Hy Columcillae.</HI> Conal had a &s;on called Donchad, who fell in battle at Loro, in Kintire, after his father's death, as we learn from the An|nals of Ul&s;ter, A. 575. <HI>Bellum de Loro in Kintire in quo cecidit Duncath Mac Conail Mac Comgail; et alii multi de &s;ociis filiorum Gauran ceciderunt.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Aidan,</HI> &s;on of Gabran, A. C. 575, reigned twenty-four years, <HI>Duan:</HI> thirty-four, by the old li&s;ts. The Annals of Ul&s;ter, Fordun, and the chronology of the old li&s;ts, fix his death at 605, and if &s;o, he reigned ju&s;t thirty years. O'Flaherty tacitly puts his reign from 574, till 606, or thirty-two years. We know from Beda's expre&s;s date that Aidan was defeated by Edilfrid in 603. At 579 we find Aidan mentioned in the An|nals of Ul&s;ter. Duncath, &s;on of Conal, &s;eems to have conte&s;ted the kingdom; and the battle of Loro, above &s;pecified, appears to have decided the conte&s;t in Aidan's favour, A. D. 575, which ju&s;t an&s;wers to the chronology here laid down, and thirty years mu&s;t be a&s;&s;igned to Aidan's reign. But perhaps the Duan dates from his unction as king, which, as we learn from Adomnan, Co|lumba long deferred, having a predilection for Aidan's brother Eogenan. Thus there were both
<PB N="114" REF="134">commotions and delay between the death of Conal, and complete unction of Aidan as king; and in all probability our bard dates from the la&s;t epoch, and not from the death of Conal, which may well have happened &s;ome years before. One of the old li&s;ts al&s;o makes Aidan's reign to be of twenty-four years, while two others give thirty-four. This Aidan is the mo&s;t noted of all the Dalriadic kings: and Adomnan, Beda, and the Iri&s;h Annals, throw con|&s;iderable light on his reign. The Duan calls him <HI>Aidan of the extended territories,</HI> and he certainly carried the Dalriadic power to a hight from which it ever after declined, till Kenneth a&s;cended the throne of Pikland. O'Flaherty tells us, that his brother Brandubius, as he chri&s;tens him in his quaint Latin, was king of Lein&s;ter. In 579, we find the battle of Ouc again&s;t Aidan, mentioned in the Ul&s;ter Annals. In 581, the battle of Manan, in which he was victor: O'Flaherty &s;ays, the ile of Maun. From Adomnan we learn, that Aidan al&s;o conquered in the battle of Miathorum, or Micithorum. O'Flaherty believes this may be the battle of Lethrigh, or Leithredh, mentioned in the Annals of Ul&s;ter, as fought by Aidan in 589. In 590, Aidan was at the famous council of Drumkeat, in the Dioce&s;e of Dere, in Ul&s;ter; con&s;i&s;ting of kings, peers, and clergy, &s;ummoned by Aid king of Ireland, and mentioned by Adomnan, who names the place <HI>Dor&s;um Ceti,</HI> a Latin tran&s;la|tion of Drumkeat. Here Columba interceded for the Iri&s;h bards, who&s;e di&s;orders provoked notice, and they were only re&s;tricted to Ul&s;ter and Dal|riada: whence may &s;pring the &s;uperiority of the Highland O&s;&s;ians, and their aver&s;ion to Ireland. In this council Aidan al&s;o procured the remi&s;&s;ion of all homage due by the kings of Dalriada, to tho&s;e of Ireland; which indeed, con&s;idering the ca&s;e, it is natural to infer they at fir&s;t paid. If we credit Iri&s;h writers, the acts of this famous council are &s;till extant. In 594, Eugain, &s;on of Gabran, and
<PB N="115" REF="135">brother of Aidan died: <HI>Ann. Ult.</HI> It is likely he is the Eoganan of Adomnan, whom Columba pre|ferred to Aidan. In 603, Aidan appears in the page of Beda, under the name of <HI>Edan rex Scotto|rum qui Britanniam inhabitant,</HI> as coming again&s;t Edilfrid, king of Northumberland, with a great army; but conquered, and e&s;caping with few. Beda adds, 'Nor from that time has any king of the Scots in Britain, dared to come to battle with the Engli&s;h to this day,' i. e. 731. Nor indeed ever after till Kenneth was called to the Piki&s;h throne. In 605, Aidan died at an advanced age, probably more oppre&s;&s;ed with chagrin at his la&s;t &s;evere check, than elated with former &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Fordun &s;ays he died in Kintyre: and was buried at Kilcheran, where no king was buried before. Do|mangard, a &s;on of Aidan, fell at Kirkuin, the year after Columba's death, or A. C. 598. <HI>Codex Cluan. et Tighern. apud O'Fl.</HI> Tighernac mentions that Conan, another &s;on of Aidan, was drowned, A. C. 622. Adomnan &s;ays, Domangard was &s;lain in Saxonia, or England; perhaps at the battle of 603, <HI>bellica in &s;trage;</HI> and he de&s;erves the greate&s;t credit.

<PB N="116" REF="136">The Iri&s;h accounts bear, that he was &s;on of Eochoid, the la&s;t king; which is improbable, as Eochoid was a young &s;on of Aidan, and a child after his father came to the throne, as appears from Adomnan; and Fercar, &s;on of Connad Keir, in&s;tantly &s;ucceeded him. Eochoid could not be above fifty-three when he died; and how could he have a grand&s;on fit to reign? The Duan, cited by O'Flaherty to this purport, &s;ays no &s;uch thing. The old Li&s;ts mark Connad Keir as the &s;on of Conal, probably the king in 560. Tig|hernac puts the death of Connad Keir at 630: and the annals of Ul&s;ter at 628. But their dates are &s;ometimes wrong. From Tighernac we learn, that in the la&s;t year of Eochoid Buide, Connad Keir conquered, and &s;lew Fiachna, &s;on of Deman, king of Ul&s;ter, in the battle of Ardco|ran. And in the only year of Connad, Malcaich &s;on of Scanlan, king of the Crutheni, or Piks in Ireland, vanqui&s;hed Connad Keir in battle at Fea|oin. In which fell Dicol of the royal race of the Piks; Rigallan &s;on of Conan, Falby &s;on of Eochoid, and grand&s;ons of Aidan; and O&s;tric, &s;on of Albert, a Saxon prince; with a va&s;t &s;laugh|ter of others.

The annals of Ul&s;ter, tho a valu|able compilation, were only completed in the year 1541, and often quote Tighernac, who wrote about 1080. Now Tighernac puts the reign of Donal Brec 637&mdash;642.

<PB N="118" REF="138">the &s;ame Annals. Donal, &s;on of Ed, king of Ireland, died in 642, at Ardfothaig, in the 14th year of his reign, as Ware informs. Adom|nan al&s;o tells us, that Donal Brec was grand&s;on of Aidan, and was defeated at Roth (Moy-Roth) by Domnail, grand&s;on of Amurec; for Aid, fa|ther of Domnail, king of Ireland, was &s;on of Amurec. See Ware. The reign of Donal Brec is therefore fixt: and the dates 677, 685, of the annals of Ul&s;ter mu&s;t be gro&s;s interpolations, and they indeed form the only grand errors i have ob&s;erved in that work<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>Perhaps this was another Donal Brec.

Congal Claon, king of Ullagh, having &s;lain Suibney, king of Ireland, Donal, brother of Suibney, &s;ucceeded in 629, de|feated Congal, and forced him to take refuge in Britain. Here Congal gained a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and e&s;pe|cially that of Donal Brec, who, in 637, attended him to Ireland with an army; but after a long and de&s;perate battle at Moyrath, Congal and Do|nal were defeated. The former was &s;lain. The later &s;o reduced, that in Adomnan's time, or about the year 700, Dalriada was in con&s;tant dread of utter &s;ubjection<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>Adomnan, lib.

In 700 we find him de&s;troy Dunolla<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">This is &s;urely the noted ca&s;tle of Dunolly in Lorn. Mr. Pennant, vol.

Ult.</HI> I &s;u&s;pect this to be one event variou&s;ly told, and that the later is the true date. But this is of no moment. In 718 Selvac appears in two battles. One again&s;t Ambkellach his bro|ther, who is conquered, and &s;lain. About 706 Selvac appears to have u&s;urped the kingdom, &s;eized his reigning brother Ambkellach, and &s;ent him bound to Ireland, as above mentioned. Amb|kellach is called <HI>The Good</HI> in the Duan; and his mildne&s;s &s;eems to have prompted his brother's ambition. For about twelve years Ambkellach &s;eems to have lived in bani&s;hment, as Malcom in Macbeth's time: but in 718 he at length pro|cured a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and was &s;lain in a&s;&s;erting his kingdom. Selvac was a warlike prince, tho a bad man; and in the &s;ame year fought a naval bat|tle again&s;t Duncha Beg, or Duncan the little, of the hou&s;e of Argyle, but king only of Cantire; Selvac having apparently &s;eized that part of Ar|gyle which was next Lorn his patrimonial country. Selvac lo&s;t this &s;ea-fight, in which many chiefs fell, and which happened off Ardane&s;&s;e, &s;ome promontory in Argyle&s;hire. In 722 we find <HI>Cle|ricatus Selvaich,</HI> or that Selvac went into a mo|na&s;tery. But this life, undertaken probably in penance for the murder of his brother, &s;uited not his temper; and he &s;eems to have a&s;pired to &s;o|vereignty again. For in 724, 5, or 6, was ano|ther battle in Argyle between Selvac, and the clan of Echtach, grand&s;on of Domnail. Duncha Beg
<PB N="123" REF="143">died in 720: and this Echtach was perhaps his &s;on, and grand&s;on of Domnail, or Donal II.

Three years after this battle Selvac died: &s;ay 726, tho the Annals of Ul&s;ter put 729. The fratricide of Selvac was puni&s;hed on his race &s;oon after, as &s;hall be &s;hewn.</P>
<P N="20">20. <HI>Eochoid</HI> III. or Achy, began to reign A. C. 726, and ruled about ten years, as appears from the dates of Selvac his predece&s;&s;or, and of Murdac his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.

That &s;illy fiction has been amply con|futed<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><P>By Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, in his "Remarks on the Hi&s;tory of Scotland." Yet this excellent writer &s;uppo&s;es, that, as the double tre&s;&s;ure appears on the Scoti&s;h arms in Wil|liam's time, 1165&mdash;1214, the league mu&s;t have been formed at that period. But it is now known to be more than dubi|ous if the fleur de lis appeared in the French arms before 1260: and, at any rate, it is denied that Scotland was &s;o very humble as to borrow any part of her arms from France, as poor e&s;quires have been known to do from nobles. The double tre&s;&s;ure is of &s;pear-heads, &s;ymbolic of warlike &s;pirit. I a&s;&s;ent therefor to the modern French writers, and to Ry|mer, that there was no league whatever between France and Scotland, till one was formed by John Baliol, which &s;erved as a ba&s;is for others, di&s;honourable and de&s;tructive to Scot|land.

Du Cange mentions a league between the French king and Llewellyn prince of Wales, &s;ealed with gold: but we find no league of that antiquity between France and Scotland. Matthew Paris gives the league between Henry III. of E. and Alex. II. whereby the kings of Scotland are bound never to make any league with the enemies of England. The con&s;equences of the French league were not mutual a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance (for Scotland a&s;&s;i&s;ted France, while France never a&s;&s;i&s;ted Scotland) but the putting of Scotland into French pay, as Swizzerland has &s;ince been. Corruption &s;pred even to the throne: and let the battle of Flodden &s;peak the effects. Our weaker writers think this league an honour to the country!

Soon after, in the &s;ame year, Talorgan, brother of Ungu&s;t, and his general, put Murdac, &s;on of Ambkellach, to utter rout; and many chiefs were &s;lain. In 743, Ungu&s;t again ravaged Dal|riada. After this, the hi&s;tory of Dalriada is al|mo&s;t annihilated in Tighernac, the Annals of Ul|&s;ter, and other authentic documents.</P>
<P>THESE events call for a pau&s;e, in order to in|ve&s;tigate a curious and important point in our hi&s;|tory, namely, What line of princes held the Dal|riadic &s;ceptre at the time the kings of Dalriada are &s;aid to have acceded to the Piki&s;h throne?</P>

<P>From the Annals of Ul&s;ter it would appear that Dunlaing, &s;on of Duncan Beg, and brother of Achy, &s;ucceeded Achy in Argyle. Conal, &s;on of Aoian, or Owen, might be an Iri&s;h prince, for his death only being mentioned, it does not ap|pear that he reigned in Kintire. In 811, is the la&s;t intelligence concerning Dalriadic affairs, the death of Angus, &s;on of Dunlaing, king of the &s;ept of Argyle.</P>
<P>We are unhappily in the greate&s;t darkne&s;s, ju&s;t before the morning breaks, in the reign of Ken|neth, &s;on of Alpin. The apparent genealogy of Angus, la&s;t king of Argyle mentioned, is Angus, &s;on of Dunlaing, &s;on of Duncan Beg, &s;on of Donal II. Duin. The&s;e four generations extend from 620, to 811, being 191 years, whereas by common rules they ought to be but 120. Dun|can Beg died about 720; Dunlaing, 746; An|gus, 811. But Donal Duin mu&s;t thus have been born a full century before the death of Duncan Beg; &s;o that there is no room to infer that Donal Duin was the Domnail, who was father of Dun|can Beg. The line of Fergus was certainly lo&s;t, on the death of Achy Rinneval; and Duncan Beg is only called king of Cantire, not even of Argyle. At any rate it is clear, by all accounts, that his race did not come to the Piki&s;h &s;ceptre; for not one name of them occurs in the genealogy of Kenneth, &s;on of Alpin. It &s;tands thus, in the old Latin li&s;ts and genealogies, Kenneth f. Alpin f. Achy Annuine f. Aod Fin f. Achy Rinneval f. Domangart f. Donal Brec. One old genealogy &s;ays f. Aod Fin f. Achy f. Achy f. Domangart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Innes, p. 795, f. <HI>Echadach</HI> f. <HI>Echach.</HI></NOTE>; and thus adds one generation. Donal Brec, died
<PB N="128" REF="148">642, Kenneth 857; include Donal, and the &s;pace will amount to about 257 years, and for this we have eight generations, by the la&s;t account, or 240 years, which is fair. But alas! all is out of order. Kenneth and Alpin are undoubted. Achy Rinne|val lived 703, and thus might be father of Aod Fin. But Aod Fin reigned 743, &s;o could not be father of Achy Annuine, 726; nor could Achy Annuine, 726, be father of Alpin, 837. Domangart died 672; &s;o that the in&s;ertion of another Achy, between him, and Achy Rinneval, 703, is erroneous. Achy Annuine was perhaps &s;on of another Achy, as Tighernac &s;ays; and the double Achy is here, if any where. If wanting, a generation is wanting; and the li&s;t incomplete. But the above radical faults are more than &s;uffi|cient to &s;tamp the whole genealogy, as one ma&s;s of fal&s;ehood, the mere work of &s;ome ignorant Highland &s;ennarchy.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be clear to every reader, that Duncan Beg, and the princes of his family, were the &s;ole repre&s;entatives of Fergus, and hereditary kings of Argyle. They are &s;o called; and the clan Ar|gyle always appears with tho&s;e of that &s;tem, again&s;t that of Loarn. Certainly then they were their undoubted and hereditary princes. The clan Argyle would never, at the price of their blood, have &s;upported a race of u&s;urpers; or divided and weakened the kingdom for their &s;ake. They would not have contended again&s;t the hou&s;e of Lorn, &s;urely better intitled to be chiefs of Argyle, than any u&s;urping race. The attachment of the highlanders to their hereditary chiefs is well known; and forbids &s;uch an idea, ab&s;urd indeed in it&s;elf. But neither Duncan Beg, nor any of his race, appear among the ance&s;tors of Kenneth, &s;on of Alpin. There is therefore rea&s;on to con|clude that Kenneth was not of the hou&s;e of Argyle, nor de&s;cended from Fergus, &s;on of Erc.</P>
<P>Was he then of the hou&s;e of Loarn? This que&s;|tion is yet more &s;trongly an&s;wered in the negative, by all the li&s;ts and genealogies.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="149">As Kenneth was certainly neither of the hou&s;e of Lorn, nor of Fergus, it remains to examine how his ance&s;tors came to the throne of Dalriada; or rather of Lorn; for Argyle &s;eems to have re|tained it's petty princes till 811 at lea&s;t. In 739, and 743, Dalriada was totally wa&s;ted by Ungu&s;t, king of Pikland, and the princes of Lorn bound in chains. Tho&s;e of Argyle were certainly not placed on the throne of Dalriada by the victor; for in 746 we find Dunlaing only &s;tyled king of the &s;ept, or clan, of Argyle. In 780, Fergus, who, by the old Latin li&s;ts, was &s;on of Aod Fin, is called king of Dalriada; as in 791 is Doncorcai. In 811 the race of Argyle are only marked as kings of Argyle. In 746, when Dunlaing was king of Argyle, Aod Fin was king of Dalriada. Thus nothing can be clearer, in &s;uch remote periods, than that the kings of Dalriada were not of the hou&s;e of Argyle, after Achy Annuine 736. That they were not of the hou&s;e of Lorn is as clear. For Ungu&s;t, in his conque&s;t of Dalriada, 739, 743, threw the princes of Lorn, Dungal, and Fe|rach, into chains; and their names never appear either in the li&s;ts, or genealogies; &s;o that Aod Fin, and the new royal &s;tem of Dalriada, did not be|long to the hou&s;e of Lorn.</P>
<P>There is therefore every rea&s;on to infer that Ungu&s;t, king of Pikland, upon his conque&s;t of Dalriada, appointed a &s;overeign Aod Fin; and that this &s;overeign was neither of the hou&s;e of Lorn, nor that of Argyle. Of what race then was he? Common &s;en&s;e, and the u&s;ual practice in &s;uch ca&s;es, dictate that Aod was of the Piki&s;h royal race; and in all probability &s;o of Ungu&s;t<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The Annals of Ul&s;ter, at 748, have <HI>Combu&s;tio Killemere a Hugone Mac Aongu&s;a.</HI> Hugo and Aod: Aongus and Ungu&s;t are the &s;ame names, as appears from the&s;e Annals, our li&s;ts, &amp;c. The king of the Piks may have &s;ent his &s;on, to a&s;&s;i&s;t one provincial king in Ireland again&s;t another.</NOTE>, who, by the Piki&s;h con&s;titution above explained,
<PB N="130" REF="150">could not a&s;cend the Piki&s;h throne, as his father had reigned. Ungu&s;t certainly had &s;ons arrived at manhood, at the time of conquering Dalriada; for in the very year of the fir&s;t conque&s;t, and cap|tivity of Dungal and Ferach, is marked the death of Brudi, a &s;on of Ungu&s;t. The Celtic language perverts names &s;trangely, as the reader may have &s;een in many in&s;tances before. <HI>Aod,</HI> pronounced <HI>Ed,</HI> is tran&s;lated <HI>Hugh</HI> by O'Flaher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and all the Iri&s;h writers. There is a Piki&s;h name <HI>Wid,</HI> certainly more like <HI>Ed</HI> than <HI>Hugh</HI> is. The addition <HI>Fin</HI> or <HI>White</HI> is generally applied to the Gothic race by the Celts, as <HI>Fingal, the white foreigners,</HI> &amp;c. for the Celts are du&s;ky; the Goths fair. The&s;e &s;light matters have &s;ome weight here. This Ed Fin, by the Duan and the li&s;ts, reigned thirty years; being the longe&s;t reign &s;ince that of Aidan. Argyle had its own princes, yet he was not mole&s;ted by them, as others of the hou&s;e of Lorn had been; tho the native &s;trength of Lorn had been cru&s;hed by Ungu&s;t. This cir|cum&s;tance &s;peaks a new and firm power. It was na|tural that Lorn, which chiefly bordered on the Piks, as Argyle did on the Stratclyde Britons, &s;hould have mo&s;t intercour&s;e with the Piks, and be the chief object of their enmity or &s;upport. It is al&s;o pro|bable that Ed Fin might, by the female line, have a claim to the kingdom of Lorn; and as the Piks regarded only the female line, his claim, or that of his father, a&s;&s;igned to him, might be &s;upported, and even allowed by the clan of Lorn, who had no rea&s;on to re&s;pect the race of the fra|tricide Selvac. If Ungu&s;t gave the kingdom of Dalriada to his &s;on, the ca&s;e was paralleled in the kingdom of Cumbria, afterward held by the &s;ons of the Scoti&s;h kings.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="151">Another &s;ingular circum&s;tance de&s;erves atten|tion. Conal 789, Con&s;tantin 795, Angus 804, Eoganan 817, are kings of Dalriada. Canul 786, Con&s;tantin 791, Ungu&s;t 821, Uven or Eogan 836, are kings of Pikland. If we &s;up|po&s;ed an error in the dates of the Annals of Ul&s;ter, concerning Doncorcai, who&s;e reign we may, with the greate&s;t probability, &s;uppo&s;e to be a little mi&s;dated, as are many others in the&s;e Annals, here are four kings in Dalriada, who apparently came to the Piki&s;h throne, before Kenneth. Ca|nul and Conal &s;eem the &s;ame. The name of Con&s;tantin is not to be found in the Iri&s;h or Dalria|dic names of kings, tho it is in the Piki&s;h; and it therefore affords a &s;light additional proof that the new Dalriadic &s;tem was Piki&s;h. And Angus or Un|gu&s;t, and Uven or Eoganan, were in appearance kings of Dalriada before they came to the Piki&s;h throne. All that Kenneth did in that ca&s;e was to render the Piki&s;h crown hereditary, which before had been elective. I &s;u&s;pect that this Eoganan was the father or Alpin, and that his name was from &s;imilar &s;ound confounded with Eochoid An|nuine, as in Iri&s;h pronunciation the names can hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed. If &s;o, Alpin was &s;on of Eoganan, or Uven, king of the Piks, who was &s;on of Ungu&s;t, king of the Piks, who was &s;on of Vergu&s;t, called Fergus by the Celtic writers. Hence the fable of Kenneth's de&s;cent from Fergus, &s;on of Erc, might &s;pring; for tradition confounds all chronology in &s;uch matters: and as the Dal|riadic Scots had all the little learning then known in North Britain, it was natural that they &s;hould apply to their own Fergus the genealogy of Ken|neth. We have an Alpin, king of the Piks, in 775, and another 725, and there is an Alpin, king of the Saxons, mentioned in the Annals of Ul&s;ter at 779 (if it be not a mi&s;take for Alpin II. king of the Piks, who died that year): but no
<PB N="132" REF="152">&s;uch name appears in either the Iri&s;h or Dalriadic li&s;t of kings. Is not this al&s;o an additional proof that Kenneth was really of Piki&s;h extract? Tig|hernac and Caradoc of Llancarvon, mentioning his death in 857, call him &s;imply, <Q>king of the Piks,</Q> without one hint of any acquired domi|nion. But of this afterward.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the genealogy of Kenneth is &s;o utterly lo&s;t, that the name of his grandfather can never be a&s;certained. The probability is clearly that he was a Piki&s;h prince, who &s;uc|ceeded his father Alpin in the kingdom of Dal|riada, an inferior Piki&s;h monarchy &s;ince the days of Aod Fin: and that taking advantage of the in|ternal divi&s;ions in Pikland, he, with the help of his Dalriadic &s;ubjects, &s;eized the Piki&s;h throne. That he was not of the old Dalriadic race, is cer|tain. There is a break in that &s;eries before Aod Fin, and another before Alpin, that Celtic forgery has not been able to &s;upply even plau&s;ibly.</P>
<P>Aod Fin, according to O'Flaherty, and the La|tin li&s;ts, was &s;on of Achy Rinneval: according to the old genealogy, he was &s;on of Achy, &s;on of Achy Rinneval. But even O'Flaherty can a&s;&s;ign no genealogy for the TEN following kings, down to Alpin. And that Aod Fin was not of the hou&s;e of Argyle, and could not be &s;on of Achy Rinneval, has been &s;hewn above.</P>
<P>But the name of the father of Alpin, father of Kenneth, i will venture to &s;ay, is lo&s;t beyond all recovery. This will &s;trike any reader at once, upon looking at the pitiful &s;hifts, and perver&s;ions, u&s;ed in this bu&s;ine&s;s. Two plans have been adopted; and both equally fal&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Latin li&s;ts, publi&s;hed by Innes, which were drawn up in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, being &s;ome of the olde&s;t monuments of our hi&s;tory extant, make Alpin, &s;on of Achy Annuine, &s;on of Aod Fin. The old genealogy,
<PB N="133" REF="153">repeated by a Highlander at the coronation of Alexander III. 1249, has the &s;ame. This &s;trange account has run thro Fordun down to Buchanan, and our own times; yet is as palpably fal&s;e, and ignorant, as could be expected even from a High|land genealogi&s;t. For, as above &s;hewn, Achy An|nuine &s;ucceeded Selvac in 726, or in 722 when Selvac retired to a mona&s;tery. The old Latin li&s;ts confirm this fully. For, as the compilers found that Selvac and Achy followed Ambkellac, who, by their own &s;tatement, reigned about the year 700, and that Achy of cour&s;e could not be the father of Alpin 837, they were forced to take out both Selvac and Achy, and throw them back before Dungal and Alpin. The rea&s;on of this <HI>only</HI> perver&s;ion in the order of the old li&s;ts thus appears at once. The ignorant authors of this childi&s;h and ea&s;y fal&s;ification did not know that the reign of Selvac was the mo&s;t certain, and fixt of any in the whole li&s;t, without exception; be|ing mentioned in no le&s;s than eight places, and interwoven with noted events in the Annals of Tighernac and Ul&s;ter; and that the death of Achy, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, was marked by Tighernac, who wrote in 1088, at the year 733. Such being the ca&s;e, this pitiful forgery, and it's cau&s;e, be|come &s;elf-apparent. This Achy, who &s;ucceeded Selvac, is the la&s;t in our hi&s;tory. There are three <HI>Eochoids</HI> (pronounced <HI>Achys</HI>) in the Dalria|dic &s;eries. <HI>Achy Buide,</HI> or the Yellow, &s;on of Aidan, 605: <HI>Achy Rinneval,</HI> or Hooked No&s;e, &s;on of Domangart, &s;on of Donal Brec, 703: and, la&s;tly, <HI>Achy Annuine,</HI> or the Poi&s;onous, 726; who, both by the Annals of Tighernac, and the old li&s;ts, &s;ucceeded Selvac, and could not po&s;&s;ibly be the father of Alpin, 837. But one fal&s;ehood mu&s;t be &s;upported by others; and the fabricators of the&s;e old li&s;ts, following the &s;econd-&s;ighted Highland genealogi&s;ts, made Achy Annuine &s;on of Aod
<PB N="134" REF="154">Fin, who did not reign till ten years after his death. Dungal, &s;on of Selvac, who is never called king of Dalriada, and it is certain never reigned, they make the &s;ame with Dungal, pre|dece&s;&s;or of Alpin 830; tho he was put in chains 739! But it is needle&s;s to dwell longer on &s;o glaring a fal&s;ification, completely refutable in a dozen different ways. Let the candid reader con|&s;ult his own thoughts, and pronounce if the&s;e poor &s;hifts amount not to more than a confe&s;&s;ion, that the father of Alpin is totally unknown to every dome&s;tic monument of our hi&s;tory.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Iri&s;h accounts are at lea&s;t as lame as the Scoti&s;h. O'Flaherty, finding that Alpin be|longed to no genealogy of Dalriadic kings, has made a father for him. He has u&s;ed the freedom to add two Achys to the Dalriadic li&s;t, to make up the real number of fifty-two kings; tho, upon looking into the Annals of Ul&s;ter, he might have &s;een that Fergus and Doncorcai were the two names, wanting in the Duan: the fir&s;t of which is al&s;o evinced from our old li&s;ts. For the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed Achy, whom he calls Achy IV. 743, he alledges the book of Synchroni&s;m, which makes an Achy king of Dalriada at the time of the death of Aid Ollain, king of Ireland, or 743. But O'Flaherty &s;eems to have redd <HI>Eochoid</HI> for <HI>Aod,</HI> the real king of Dalriada at that time: and our old li&s;ts ac|knowlege only the three Achys above &s;tated. It is indeed likely that the Book of Synchroni&s;ms may, by a mi&s;take of a few years, mean Achy III. But his Achy V. whom he places after Eoganan, and makes the father of Alpin, who &s;ucceeds him, is the offspring of his own brains; being unknown to the Duan, Old Li&s;ts, Iri&s;h Annals, and every hi&s;torical monument whatever. O'Flaherty could forge as well as another genealogi&s;t; and found this in&s;ertion nece&s;&s;ary; but could not even co|lour the fal&s;ehood. To this Achy V. he cannot
<PB N="135" REF="155">a&s;&s;ign even one year's reign. The three genera|tions of Achy V. Alpin, Kenneth, he puts in a cour&s;e of twenty years! The Duan, tho defective in three other places, cannot be &s;o here, as the very rimes &s;hew that there was no king between Dungal II. and Alpin. Yet O'Flaherty leaves out Dungal, to make room for this Achy V. Thus it is clear, from both Iri&s;h and Scoti&s;h accounts, that the name of Alpin's father is quite unknown.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s that this total failure of the Dalria|dic li&s;t was mo&s;t unexpected by me; and &s;truck me with great &s;urprize when i di&s;covered it: for i had always regarded it as a certain fact, that the Old Scoti&s;h, or Dalriadic line, had, in direct and clear genealogy, acceded to the Piki&s;h throne. But the above cogent rea&s;ons force me to abandon this idea; and to allow that the very contrary was the truth; and that the Piki&s;h race acceded to the throne of Dalriada, a century before the Piks and Scots were united under Kenneth. Such be|ing the ca&s;e, the Iri&s;h extraction of our kings falls to the ground, in &s;pite of all the labour which Iri&s;h antiquaries have employed to prove it; and their labours have indeed only proved the rever&s;e. It is from their own annals, and antiquaries, that this di&s;covery can alone be placed in the cleare&s;t day. But this point, and the origin of the new name of Scotland, &s;hall be treated afterward.</P>
<P>Let us conclude with a brief review of the Dal|riadic &s;eries. This &s;eries may be divided into Two Parts; the CLEAR, and the OBSCURE. The FIRST Part reaches from Loarn and Fergus, or the beginning, down to the reign of <HI>Aod Fin,</HI> 743. The SECOND or OBSCURE Part reaches from that epoch to the end. This very circum&s;tance, of the la&s;t part being ob&s;cure, certainly &s;hews a kingdom declining in power, and not increa&s;ing &s;o as to conquer the great Piki&s;h kingdom, as vulgarly dreamed. Had the later been the ca&s;e,
<PB N="136" REF="156">the hi&s;tory of Dalriada would have been more and more important, and notorious; while, in fact, after it's conque&s;t by Ungu&s;t, it &s;inks to nothing at once. The Piki&s;h affairs, on the con|trary, become more and more known. This is left to the cool con&s;ideration of the reader. In the FIRST Part the Duan, Old Li&s;ts, and Iri&s;h Annals, mutually confirm each other.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER VI.</HI> Manners, Languages, Antiquities, &amp;c. of the Old Briti&s;h Scots.</HEAD>
<P>THE manners and language of the Ancient Briti&s;h Scots, being the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the Iri&s;h Scots, their progenitors, little need be &s;aid on this &s;ubject. Both are Gothic mingled with Celtic. Ancient writers repre&s;ent the Iri&s;h Scots, and their progeny the Attacotti, as &s;avages in the extreme. The&s;e accounts are confirmed by the long de&s;cription of the Iri&s;h given by Giral|dus Cambren&s;is; by the con&s;tant epithets of <HI>feri</HI> and <HI>&s;ylvicolae,</HI> given to our Highlanders, by our wri|ters; and by the infallible evidence of pre&s;ent ob|&s;ervation. In vain do Iri&s;h writers attempt to rea&s;on again&s;t the ocular te&s;timony of Giraldus; and to per&s;uade us that the Old Iri&s;h were not &s;avages. We mu&s;t entreat them not to rea&s;on us out of our &s;en&s;es, by decrying the evidence of our own eyes. For the Wild Iri&s;h are the genuine remains of the Old Iri&s;h, with the very manners de&s;cribed by ancient writers.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Scots, or Goths, who ruled in Ireland, were &s;oon lo&s;t among the numerous Celtic natives. In the time of Saint Patrick, 440, a great di&s;|tinction prevailed as above &s;hewn; but &s;oon after the term Scots became general to all the inhabi|tants of Ireland, which was it&s;elf called <HI>Scotia:</HI> and the <HI>Lingua Scotica,</HI> was the Gaelic of Ireland. But in the time of Saint Patrick <HI>Scotus</HI> and <HI>Hi|bernus</HI> were by no means &s;ynonymous; and it
<PB N="139" REF="161">&s;eems thence certain that they were not &s;o in the Third century, when Riada led his colony of Scots (not Hiberni) to Pikland; nor &s;o &s;oon after Patrick's time as 503, when Loarn and Fergus re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the colony. Beda calls Aidan 603, <HI>rex Scottorum in Britannia;</HI> and it is appa|rent that the Dalriadic Scots con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of Scots, or Goths, of Ireland, tho u&s;ing the Celtic tongue. From this circum&s;tance may &s;pring the peculiar Gothic epithet of 'yellow haired' given to the Albanach by the poet of the Duan; and the &s;uperior warlike &s;pirit of the Highlanders com|pared to the Wild Iri&s;h. But the Highlanders, tho originally rather Goths than Celts, and tho afterward mingled with Piks and Norwegians, had been &s;o contaminated with a Celtic mixture in Ireland, that their &s;peech and mo&s;t of their man|ners were, and are, rather Celtic than Gothic<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Macpher&s;on, Dr. Smith, in his Gaelic Antiquities, and others, give long accounts of the manners of the High|lands. Tho&s;e authors, under the idea of Druidic manners, &amp;c. give us the commone&s;t Norwegian cu&s;toms, left by them in the Highlands, as appears from the Scandinavian antiqua|ries, whom they never con&s;ult.</P>
<P>It has been long &s;ince a&s;&s;erted, and lately repeated, that the Celtic and Tartar languages approximate; but upon look|ing into the &s;pecimens in Chamberlayne's Oratio Dominica, it will be &s;een at once that there is not the &s;malle &s;t&s;imilarity. The names of Tartar chiefs may be ea&s;ily interpreted, in Cel|tic, by tho&s;e ignorant of the true meaning. Any names will bear &s;uch interpretation in any &s;peech. See Swift's Etymo|logies, <HI>pa&s;&s;im.</HI></P></NOTE>. And in lazine&s;s, filth, and every &s;pecies of &s;avage|ne&s;s, they have been always hardly di&s;tingui&s;hable from the &s;avages of Ireland. In all ages of our hi&s;tory they are marked as the &s;avages of Scot|land; and uniformly mentioned as &s;uch by fo|reigners, and by Lowland writers. Every one, who has even travelled in Scotland, mu&s;t have &s;een at one glance that the Highlanders are of as different a race from the Lowlanders, as the Old Welch from the Engli&s;h, or the Old Bretons from
<PB N="140" REF="162">the people of Normandy. Their hilly habitation alone could not occa&s;ion this difference; for the inhabitants of the Alps; Apennines; Pyrenees; mountains in the north of England, and in Ire|land; Carpathian mountains, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. differ not from tho&s;e in the plains. And it is in the we&s;t of Ireland, the mo&s;t champain part of that iland, that the old Iri&s;h are now found in their primitive &s;avagene&s;s. Nor is Bretagne a moun|tainous country. Had the Celtic part of our countrymen been in the ea&s;tern plains, the ca&s;e would have been the &s;ame: as the Fins, for in|&s;tance, are in a plain country, while the Norwe|gians are in we&s;tern mountains ju&s;t &s;imilar to our Highlands. Had the&s;e Norwegians been general inhabitants in the Highlands of Scotland, with &s;uch &s;uperior harbours and opportunities, the&s;e Highlands would now be as full of towns and commerce as Norway is. But our Highland po|pulation appears from the compari&s;on to be too truly Celtic: and the Gothic mixture has lo&s;t all effect, as a generous liquor will, when mixt with one of baleful quality. The people of the Ork|neys are pure Goths; and are &s;o much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the Hebudes, that Kirkwall is one of the mo&s;t poli&s;hed places in Britain. Stornoway, the only town in the Celtic part of Scotland, was founded by the Dutch; and is now gone to ruin. In vain would we excite indu&s;try among &s;avages; the point is to colonize the country afre&s;h.</P>
<P>Ancient monuments of the Briti&s;h Scots there are none, &s;ave cairns of &s;tones, u&s;ed as &s;epulchres, and as memorials. The&s;e were adapted to Celtic indolence: while the Gothic indu&s;try rai&s;ed va&s;t &s;tones, in&s;tead of piling &s;mall ones: nor are any cairns found in Gothic countries, &s;o far as i can learn, except &s;uch as are very large. The Celtic churches, hou&s;es, &amp;c. were all of wattles, as are the barns at this day in the Hebudes; &s;o that no ruins can be found of them. The early cathedral
<PB N="141" REF="163">of Hyona mu&s;t have been of this &s;ort; and it was burnt by the Danes in the ninth century. The pre&s;ent ruin is not older than the thirteenth. In the twelfth century Saint Bernard repre&s;ents a &s;tone church as quite a novelty even in Ireland.</P>
<P>As to the language of the Dalriads, the only difference between it and the Iri&s;h, at pre&s;ent, is that the former has rather more Gothic words. Anciently they were quite the &s;ame, as indeed they are very nearly &s;o now: the difference not be|ing &s;o great as between the provincial dialects in England. The old Gaelic, like the modern, was a totally different dialect of the Celtic from the old Welch, as Beda &s;ufficiently proves, who marks them as different languages.</P>
<P>The kingdom was hereditary; but the brother was always e&s;teemed a nearer heir than the &s;on<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>O'Flaherty regards this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as merely a guard again&s;t minorities. He &s;ays, Ogyg. Vind. p. 153, "Neither was there ever a minor king of Ireland; being continually excluded by the law of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion." Fordun III. 4. &s;ays, the uncles only ruled, till the nephews came to majority; but IV. 1. he allows that they reigned before them; and i can find no in&s;tance of a regency.</P></NOTE>. An infant king mu&s;t indeed be a phaenomenon unknown to early kingdoms; in which king and general are commonly &s;ynonymous. According to Iri&s;h antiquaries, the chief monarchy of Ireland was elective in a certain family: and Mr. O'Conor &s;ays the Dalriadic was &s;o. But it appears from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that the later kingdom was heredi|tary, and there is no proof of election. The kingdom of Dalriada indeed differed radically from that of Ireland, which con&s;i&s;ted in a &s;ove|reignty over not le&s;s than twenty-five kinglets: and the kinglet of Dalriada was one of them, till Aidan's time. It mu&s;t therefore be compared, not with the kingdom of Ireland, but with it's petty royalties; and was but the chief&s;hip of a large clan. For clans, <HI>Genera,</HI> or <HI>Familiae,</HI> are primitive in&s;titutions; and occur in the earlie&s;t
<PB N="142" REF="164">Iri&s;h periods and writers. And their very e&s;&s;ence implies hereditary government, a mode u&s;ed by different Gothic nations in the mo&s;t ancient times. The Piki&s;h monarchy was confined to one royal race: but it de&s;cended by the female, not by the male line: and the &s;on of a king was always ex|cluded; while in Dalriada the ca&s;e was in both points rever&s;ed. Hence the Piki&s;h &s;trikes us as a mere elective monarchy, the Dalriadic as heredi|tary. But the later cea&s;ed to be &s;o, before the kingdoms were united by Kenneth: and it is even uncertain if Kenneth was of the Dalriadic race, if not certain that he was of the Piki&s;h: &s;o that neither the Dalriadic nor Piki&s;h &s;eries can afford hi&s;toric certainty of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, ju&s;t before Alpin and Kenneth. The line of Scoti&s;h kings mu&s;t therefore, in all events, only com|mence with Kenneth: and to the Forty taken from the li&s;t by Innes, Twenty-eight mu&s;t be added: who, tho they really exi&s;ted, had no more to do with the kingdom of pre&s;ent Scotland, than the kings of Stratclyde. And their hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion totally fails more than a century before the reign of Kenneth; &s;o that even the name of Kenneth's grandfather cannot be recovered, as above &s;hewn.</P>
<P>Let us clo&s;e this chapter with a few hints con|cerning Dalriadic manners. Giraldus Cambren&s;is, in his account of the Iri&s;h, &s;ays, mo&s;t of them were cloathed in black wrappers; as mo&s;t of their &s;heep were black. They u&s;ed little <HI>caputii,</HI> or hoods of plaid, linen ve&s;ts, and trow&s;ers. The phillibeg is quite unknown to the Welch, and Iri&s;h, lan|guage and manners. The gaudie&s;t ornament of the old Iri&s;h, and Highlanders was the <HI>fibula,</HI> or broach; &s;ometimes as large as a &s;mall plater, of gold, &s;ilver, or bra&s;s, ornamented with precious &s;tones. With it the plaid was fa&s;tened at the brea&s;t; and &s;ometimes a &s;maller broach within the large one fa&s;tened the plaid, while the later was
<PB N="143" REF="165">only ornamental. The dre&s;s of old Iri&s;h kings, as appears from monuments, was a clo&s;e ve&s;t; long trow&s;ers down to the ancle; and a long loo&s;e robe over all, that reached to the ground, was brought over the &s;houlders, and fa&s;tened on the brea&s;t, by a very large cla&s;p or broch<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Collectanea de Reb. Hib. N^o XI.</NOTE>. This dre&s;s is ab&s;o|lutely Gothic. The primitive Celtic dre&s;s was only a &s;kin thrown over the &s;houlder, and a piece of cloth tied round the middle. Gildas mentions the la&s;t as the dre&s;s of the Scots or Iri&s;h in his time.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h armies con&s;i&s;ted entirely of infantry: but laterly of two kinds. The <HI>Galloglachs</HI> were heavy armed, with helmet, and coat of mall, long &s;words, and pollaxes. The <HI>Keherns</HI> were light in|fantry, with javelins, and &s;hort daggers called <HI>&s;keyns.</HI> The pollax was peculiarly common in Ireland in the time of Giraldus, and was always carried in the hand as a &s;taff. Their ferocity in war was great, and prompted the ancient, but fal&s;e, accu&s;ation that they ate human food. Dio|dorus Siculus, the fir&s;t who mentions this, al&s;o imputes the &s;ame practice to the German Gauls on the Rhine. But as Tacitus, and other better informed writers, found the later fal&s;e; &s;o the fal&s;ehood of the former would have appeared, as is rea&s;onable to infer, had any Roman writer really vi&s;ited Ireland. Strabo and others continue this charge. Saint Jerome is, it is believed, the la&s;t; and he imputes it to the Attacotti. It is cer|tain that human &s;acrifices were u&s;ed among the early Goths, as they were in Greece and Rome; and as the later nations are great part of the common &s;acrifices, it was natural for them to con|clude that the &s;ame practice prevailed among other nations. But it was not &s;o; for the human carca&s;es were hung up in the holy grove. This however &s;eems the real origin of the fiction. The
<PB N="144" REF="166">Attacottic fea&s;ts were more innocent, and con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of veni&s;on and other game. Their drink i do not find much illu&s;trated. Ale they could not have, without agriculture. Ireland was always famous for bees; and mead would be a common liquor of cour&s;e. The poor would, as now, u&s;e butter-milk. As to <HI>u&s;quebaugh,</HI> or <HI>aqua vitae,</HI> i agree with Ware, that it is of late times. The Sarmatic di&s;tillation from corrupted milk could not be known in Ireland; nor had they mares enough to procure it. To the Germans, and other Goths, it was unknown. Nor could the Iri&s;h di&s;till from oats, while agriculture was hardly in u&s;e. In the mountains of Argyle there was no room for agriculture; and wine was &s;urely unknown, as there was no commerce. When whi&s;ky became known in the Highlands, perhaps three centuries ago, it was, as it is now in poor hou&s;es there, drunk out of &s;hells, in&s;tead of li|queur gla&s;&s;es. The&s;e whi&s;ky-&s;hells the learned fa|bricator of O&s;&s;ian makes very ancient; and his heroes at the <HI>fea&s;t of &s;hells,</HI> or whi&s;ky-fea&s;t, enjoy them&s;elves in potations of half a gill a piece, while the naughty Germans were emptying quart horns<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The &s;hells are &s;mall &s;callop-&s;hells; and in drinking the ball of the thumb is placed on the hinge part. They are only u&s;ed as liqueur gla&s;&s;es for whi&s;ky.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As Aidan and Columba protected the Iri&s;h bards at the council of Drumkeat, there is rea&s;on to think that not a few of them mu&s;t have re|paired to Dalriada. The following &s;tory occurs in Adomnan's life of Columba, written about the year 700<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lib. I. c. 13. edit. Me&s;&s;ingham.</NOTE>. 'Another time, when the &s;aint was &s;itting at the lake Kei, near the mouth of the river, which in Latin is <HI>Bos</HI> (Damh?) with the bre|thren, an Iri&s;h poet came up to them, and, after &s;ome conver&s;ation, departed. Upon which the brethren &s;aid to the &s;aint, Why did you allow
<PB N="145" REF="167">Coronan to depart, without a&s;king him to &s;ing us &s;ome &s;ong in modulation, according to the cu&s;|tom of his art? To which the &s;aint an&s;wered, Why do you &s;peak u&s;ele&s;s words? How could I a&s;k a &s;ong of gladne&s;s from that mi&s;erable wretch, who, at this moment &s;lain by his enemies, &s;tood then at the end of his life? The &s;aint had no &s;ooner &s;poken, than a man called from the other &s;ide of the river, &s;aying, That poet, who ju&s;t left you in &s;afety, is &s;lain in his journey by enemies. Then all who were pre&s;ent looked at each other in great amazement.' The place of this &s;cene i cannot a&s;certain; but it affords a &s;trong &s;pecimen of the &s;avage ferocity of the age. Upon the con|&s;truction of the old Celtic poetry we want much information. Mo&s;t of it was accompanied with mu&s;ic. Giraldus Cambren&s;is informs us, that the in&s;truments in Ireland were the harp and the ta|bor; in Scotland the harp, tabor, and <HI>chorus</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chorus, in&s;trumentum mu&s;icae, <HI>Girald.

<P>AT length we arrive at a period of Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory, which may rea&s;onably be expected to be more clear than the preceding; namely, that from 843 till 1056. Our whole hi&s;tory may be divided into Four Periods:

<PB N="150" REF="171">Period, from 843 till 1056.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Clear Pe|riod, from 1056 till the Union of England and Scotland.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Third Period, on which we now enter, might be expected to be clearer than the two pre|ceding: and yet i que&s;tion much if this be the ca&s;e. Far from the cla&s;&s;ic light, which is thrown on the fir&s;t part by Tacitus, and others, there is not even an Adomnan, or a Beda; and the Iri&s;h writers, wholly occupied with the mi&s;eries of their own country, occa&s;ioned by the Northern invaders, hardly mark, now and then, the death of a king of North Britain. In Scotland it&s;elf not a native writer aro&s;e till the thirteenth century: and their brief accounts are perverted with gro&s;s traditional fable. For the&s;e rea&s;ons i rather in|cline to regard this Third Period as the mo&s;t ob&s;cure of Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory, and as a dark night ju&s;t before the day of our Clear Period. In|deed, over all Europe, as is well known, the ninth and tenth centuries form the deepe&s;t night, be|tween ancient and modern day. In the eighth century the former fails; and in the eleventh a new morning ari&s;es, and authentic writers appear in mo&s;t countries.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the mo&s;t important event, in the ancient hi&s;tory of Scotland, took place in this darke&s;t night; namely, the Union of the Piks and Dalriads. Concerning this great event, upon which our whole hi&s;tory turns, we have no information till two centuries after, when accounts, palpably fabulous and ab&s;urd, began to be blindly followed by old writers. So that the night is not only dark, but haunted with &s;pectres of fiction; and i am tempted to exclaim with Ta&s;&s;o,
<Q><L>Degne d'un chiaro &s;ol, degne d'un pieno</L>
<L>Teatro, opre &s;arian &s;i memorande.</L>
<L>Notte, che nel profondo o&s;curo &s;eno</L>

<L>A le future eta lo &s;pieghi, e mande.</L>
<L>Viva la fama loro, e tra lor gloria</L>
<L>Splenda del fo&s;co tuo l'alta memoria.</L></Q>
The great importance, and thick ob&s;curity, of this event, render all the powers of indu&s;try and &s;agacity nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;tigate it; and yet none of our antiquaries has yet lent it any examina|tion. I am therefore induced to treat it with the minutene&s;s and prolixity of a &s;pecial di&s;&s;ertation. The late prevalence of the names <HI>Scot</HI> and <HI>Scot|land,</HI> as the real &s;ource of the old fables, &s;o is the cau&s;e of their currency at this day. Let us fir&s;t examine tho&s;e fables.</P>
<P>In Chap. IV. of this Part, where the cau&s;es of the new name of <HI>Scotland</HI> being given to North Britain are examined, the reader will find rea&s;on to conclude that this appellation (certainly un|known till about the year 1016 or 1020) was im|po&s;ed by the Iri&s;h monks and clergy, the only literati whom the country then had. A con&s;e|quence of this erroneous denomination, was that, apparently in the &s;ame century, the &s;ame Iri&s;h churchmen began to fable, that the Old Scots, or Dalriads, had vanqui&s;hed the Piks. This fable aro&s;e partly from the deep ob&s;curity of the ninth and tenth centuries, &s;o univer&s;ally felt over Europe; but chiefly from the natural predilection of the&s;e churchmen for the colony of their coun|trymen in North Britain. It was indeed a natural and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the new name of <HI>Scotia;</HI> the origin of which the reader will find in the chapter above-mentioned.</P>
<P>Of cour&s;e it is not &s;urprizing that in the <HI>Chro|nicon Pictorum</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This piece is &s;plit into two by Innes, p. 773, 782. con|trary to the MS. See it in the Appendix to Vol. I. The fir&s;t part mu&s;t have been copied from ancient li&s;ts: that after Kenneth &s;eems original.</NOTE>, we find the conque&s;t of the Piks by Kenneth a&s;&s;erted. That venerable piece ends

Yet he mentions no conque&s;t of the Piks by the Dalriads, &s;o that he was a &s;tranger to the fables about to be con&s;idered. The words of Gi|raldus, in his <HI>Topographia Hiberniae,</HI> lib. III. c. 16, after &s;peaking of St. Patrick's arrival in Ireland in 432, Leogaire, &s;on of Nell, being king of Ireland, are as follow: <HI>Hic quoque notandum videtur, prae|dicto Nello Hiberniae monarchiam obtinente, &s;ex filios Muredi Regis Ultoniae, in cla&s;&s;e non modica, Boreales Britanniae partes occupa&s;&s;e.

Whence their progeny, by a &s;pecial name called Scots, inhabit that corner to this day. But for what cau&s;es they came here, and by what trea&s;ons, rather than expeditions, they expelled the Piks, a nation mo&s;t powerful in arms, and far &s;uperior in courage, from the&s;e parts, &s;hall be more fully explained when we publi&s;h that notable Topogra|phy of Britain." This Topography never ap|peared, or at lea&s;t cannot be found, tho long and anxiou&s;ly &s;ought after by many. But the above hint was &s;ufficient for tho&s;e Scoti&s;h writers, who were afterward to commence authors of our hi&s;tory, with &s;mall talents for &s;uch an impor|tant office, to narrate in &s;olemn terms the
<PB N="56" REF="177" MS="y">conque&s;t of the Piks by the Dalriads, are pretended Scots. For in tho&s;e times the few Scoti&s;h writers always followed and imitated the Engli&s;h, as few or no other manu&s;cripts then found their way into Scotland. Thus Fordun and Winton follow the Polycronicon in plan; and the Regiam Maje&s;tatem is a mere ex&s;cript of Glan|ville. Geoffrey of Monmouth furni&s;hed Fordun with half his fables. William of Malm&s;bury, and Henry of Huntingdon, are al&s;o familiar to For|dun, who puts from the la&s;t the total de&s;truction of the Piks, tho he blends it al&s;o with the later fables of Giraldus. And this very work and pa&s;|&s;age of Giraldus is referred to by Fordun, lib. I. c. 18. for the origin of the name <HI>Scotia.</HI></P>
<P>But let the pa&s;&s;age it&s;elf declare how worthy he was of belief. In his account of Iri&s;h hi&s;tory he &s;hews the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance: and in this hint of Scoti&s;h, the whole is one blunder. The &s;ettle|ment of the &s;ix &s;ons of Mured, in the reign of Nell, father of Leogaire, or about the year 400, is unknown to every Iri&s;h and Scoti&s;h monument of hi&s;tory; to Beda, Nennius, &amp;c. Beda directly confutes it, by marking Reuda as the fir&s;t leader of the Old Scots from Ireland; and no one can he&s;itate to &s;tamp it an arrant fiction. Giraldus calls that part of Britain, north of Forth and Clyde, a corner; tho it be &s;ix or eight times the &s;ize of all Wales, his country, put together. If he means Dalriada, or Argyle&s;hire, that is indeed a corner; but a corner nearly as large as Wales. There was not even a king of Ul&s;ter till the eleventh century; as appears from Tighernac, and other ancient Iri&s;h writers. But it is clear that he wrote this in a total ignorance, both of the country, and of it's hi&s;tory: and if he be the author of the <HI>De&s;criptio Albaniae,</HI> it mu&s;t have been written after this; and he profited, as that <HI>De&s;criptio</HI> &s;ays it's author did, by the advice of Andrew bi&s;hop of Caithne&s;s, in both points; for he there, with as ri&s;ible exce&s;s,

<P>Meantime the fiction thrived in England. Roger of Che&s;ter wrote his Polychronicon about 1330; which is imputed to Higden the plagiary of it. In an excellent MS. of that work, containing pa&s;|&s;ages not found in other MSS. and which bears the name of Roger of Che&s;ter, and is written about 1350,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In Bibl. Harl. No. 655.</NOTE> it is &s;aid that the Scots invited the chiefs of the Piks to an entertainment; and &s;lew them by ba&s;e treachery. It is added, <HI>Sicque de duobus populis gens bellico&s;ior totaliter evanuit.</HI> A &s;trange affair, that, becau&s;e it's chiefs were &s;lain, a whole nation &s;hould <HI>totally vani&s;h!</HI> Well does O'Fla|herty laugh at this total extinction; for it tran|&s;cends any thing in Iri&s;h fable. Need we a &s;tronger proof that this period of our hi&s;tory is the mo&s;t ob&s;cure of all? Is there &s;o gro&s;s a fable in the Roman or Piki&s;h periods?</P>
<P>Fordun followed: and from him this fable pa&s;&s;ed to all our hi&s;torians to this day.

<PB N="158" REF="179">given, WHEN FALSEHOOD IS RECEIVED AS TRUTH, THE OPPOSITE TRUTH MUST OF ABSOLUTE NECESSITY PASS FOR FALSEHOOD? The names <HI>Scot</HI> and <HI>Scot|land</HI> had totally turned the brains of Fordun, who was him&s;elf, as O'Flaherty ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, a Pik. Yet he &s;pares no fal&s;ehood to de&s;troy the honour of the Piks, and to a&s;&s;ert that of the pre|tended Scots. Can human madne&s;s proceed to a greater height? What are human affairs, when one name, one word, can pervert the integrity, and common &s;en&s;e, of the writers of a whole na|tion for five centuries? Fordun has exerted all his little powers of fiction to adorn the cata&s;trophe of the Piks. Kenneth u&s;es a mo&s;t &s;agacious &s;trata|gem, to encourage his chiefs to this great con|que&s;t, by dre&s;&s;ing a man with luminous &s;kins of fi&s;h, who, with the voice of an angel, denounces vengeance on the Piks. But enough of this childi&s;h fable.</P>
<P>Happily more ancient and purer &s;ources re|main, from which it is clear, that this very Ken|neth was king of the Piks. That the name of Scots was not extended to the inhabitants of North Britain till about 1020, in the reign of Malcom II. who&s;e predece&s;&s;ors are called kings of the Piks. That Kenneth, far from conquering or ex|tirpating the Piks, was a monarch of their own royal &s;tem; and, if he conquered any nation, it mu&s;t have been the Old Scots of Dalriada. The&s;e matters may appear &s;trange, as indeed truth mu&s;t to tho&s;e accu&s;tomed to fal&s;ehood; but as truth is in it's nature directly oppo&s;ite to fal&s;ehood, and it is certain that Kenneth did not conquer the Piks, but was their own proper &s;overeign; a can|did mind will naturally conclude, that the truth of this matter is the very rever&s;e of it's fal&s;ehood, in every point: and that of cour&s;e Kenneth, king of the Piks, conquered the Dalriads. Were i to embrace this other extreme &s;ide of the que&s;tion, i would argue thus.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="180">The name of Scotland not being given to North Britain till about 1020, as after &s;hewn; that is near two dark centuries after Kenneth, it is out of the que&s;tion. The Iri&s;h churchmen, re|ceiving more and more encouragement, as Chri&s;|tianity advanced in Pikland, where learning was unknown among the natives, till a late period (the thirteenth century), might ea&s;ily occa&s;ion this perver&s;ion of our hi&s;tory, by a&s;cribing to their countrymen the Old Scots of Dalriada, what was really due to the Piks. The later had pre&s;erved the memory of their Scythic extraction, as appears from the <HI>Chronicon Pictorum,</HI> publi&s;hed by Innes; and as <HI>Scot</HI> was but another term for <HI>Scythian,</HI> as above &s;hewn, the name with more propriety belonged to the Piks, than to the Dalriads. In the time of Adomnan and Beda, the later were alone called Scots of Britain; but this was before any due knowlege was had of the Piks, or of the Scy|thic origin of the fir&s;t Scots. As more informa|tion was got, the name of Scythians, or Scots, was found to belong to both nations; and was with great propriety given to both. Thus the word <HI>Scotti Britanniae,</HI> which, in Beda's time, im|plied only the Dalreudini; in the eleventh cen|tury included the Piks, nay chiefly denoted them, as they were indeed real Scots or Scythians, while the Dalreudini were more than half Celts, and &s;poke the Celtic tongue. But they who gave the generic name of Scots to the Piks did not reflect on the confu&s;ion this novelty mu&s;t occa&s;ion; while, by retaining the old names, all would have been clear. In the twelfth century, as we learn from many Engli&s;h cotemporary writers, the name of Piks was re&s;tricted to the people of Galloway, who having been &s;eparated from the Piki&s;h kingdom by that of Stratclyde, lying be|tween, had their own lords, and retained the Piki&s;h name. Now it is clear that the Piks, again&s;t whom Alpin and his &s;on Kenneth fought,
<PB N="160" REF="181">were tho&s;e of Galloway only. The tales of For|dun, invented by him&s;elf, de&s;erve no notice; and his fal&s;ehood is now too well known to meet with any. The Regi&s;ter of the Priory of St. Andrew's, one of the olde&s;t monuments of our hi&s;tory, &s;ays, <HI>Alpin occi&s;us e&s;t in Gallewathia, po&s;tquam eam peni|tus de&s;truxit, et deva&s;tavit. Et hinc tran&s;latum e&s;t regnum Scotorum in regnum Pictorum.</HI> The Piki&s;h kingdom was on the north and ea&s;t of Dalriada; and not in Galloway. This is the origin of the fable concerning the battles of Kenneth again&s;t the Piks. Kenneth was natural &s;overeign of the Piki&s;h kingdom; but wanted to &s;ubdue the Gal|wegians to it; and it happened afterward that the Galwegians were peculiarly termed Piks, af|ter that name had cea&s;ed in the real Piki&s;h king|dom. Thus the fable can be traced even to it's &s;ource: and the di&s;tinction between Piks and Scots became, in this darke&s;t period of our hi&s;|tory, totally different from what is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>That the language of the Scotti, the Iri&s;h, pre|vailed in Scotland after the time of Kenneth, there is not a &s;hadow of proof. The exten&s;ion of the Highlanders, and of their &s;peech, &s;eem to be|long to the times when the Norwegians drove them from the Hebudes, and we&s;tern coa&s;t. They al&s;o naturally &s;pred into the north of Scot|land, after the Norwegian power failed there, be|ing the neare&s;t inhabitants; and adapted by na|ture and cu&s;toms to mountainous and barren re|gions. Their &s;peech had indeed a great advan|tage over the Piki&s;h, in being a written and cul|tivated language, &s;ince the time of St. Patrick; while Ninian and Columba, the apo&s;tles of the Piks, mo&s;t unfortunately totally neglected to teach them to write their own language. But as there is not a &s;hadow of proof that the Iri&s;h tongue ever was at all u&s;ed in the Lowlands of Scotland, it is needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t further upon this.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="182">The que&s;tion then remains entire, whether the union of the Piks and Dalriads, fal&s;ely called Scots, was not effected by a complete conque&s;t of the later, by the former, under Kenneth their own proper king? Tighernac, and Caradoc of Llancarvon who wrote a century after Tigher|nac, or about 1180, mark the death of Kenneth, &s;imply as king of the Piks; ju&s;t as they &s;tate the death of Kenneth I. &s;on of Luthrin, or of any other Piki&s;h kings. The title of king of the Piks continues; that of king of Dalriada, or of the Old Briti&s;h Scots is extinct. Would not plain &s;en&s;e argue from this, that the Piks had conquered the Dalriads? The hi&s;tory of the later after their conque&s;t by Ungu&s;t, 740, becomes more and more ob&s;cure, till it is totally extin|gui&s;hed. That of the Piks is more and more known. The Iri&s;h writers would naturally favour the Dalriads; yet it is from them that the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances fully appear. In common argument, <HI>a probabili,</HI> that the Piks vanqui&s;hed the Dalriads is rational: that the Dalriads &s;hould conquer the Piki&s;h kingdom, e&s;pecially at a time when the former were &s;o reduced, and the later &s;o powerful, is ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible. The Danes ravage the Dalriads with impunity; no king, no army, ap|pears again&s;t them. In Pikland there are great battles, and the Danes gain no footing. The Norwegians about 880 &s;eize mo&s;t of the territo|ries of the Dalriads; and hold them for near four centuries. In the north of Pikland they effect a &s;ettlement; but the Piki&s;h power gains as much on the &s;outh, as it lo&s;es on the north; and gains fertile plains, while it yields barren mountains. In &s;hort, upon every principle of hi&s;toric autho|rity, and of argument, if the &s;ole que&s;tion were whether the Piks conquered the Dalriads, or the contrary, there is no room to he&s;itate in &s;aying, that the truth is directly oppo&s;ite to our Celtic fa|bles,
<PB N="162" REF="183">and that the Piks conquered the Dalriads. Nor would this Celtic perver&s;ion of hi&s;tory want example in Welch, or in Iri&s;h hi&s;tory. Had not Gildas and Beda remained, Arthur's conque&s;t of England might be &s;till believed; tho the poor fa|thers of the fable be confined to a few mountains. The victories of the Gael over the Firbolg, in Iri&s;h hi&s;tory, are of the &s;ame cla&s;s; and the&s;e Cel|tic fablers make the former the Scotti, while the later are the Scotti. As it is to Highland &s;ena|chies and Iri&s;h churchmen, that we owe the con|que&s;t of the Piks by the Dalriads, there is per|fect analogy in the ca&s;e, and every room to infer that the u&s;ual perver&s;ion of Celtic under&s;tanding has taken place, and that the truth is the direct rever&s;e.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid there are two arguments, to be drawn from the old li&s;ts of our kings again&s;t this account.

</LIST></P>
<P>To the fir&s;t of the&s;e arguments it is an&s;wered, that the Piki&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion became hereditary before Kenneth; as Dru&s;t IX. &s;on of Con&s;tantin, and Uven &s;on of Ungu&s;t II. came to the crown after their fathers; as formerly explained in the Chapter of Piki&s;h kings. And the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e is ab&s;olutely &s;imilar to that after Kenneth, for fir&s;t Ungu&s;t II. brother of Con&s;tantin &s;ucceeds, then Dru&s;t IX. &s;on of Con&s;tantin.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd it is an&s;wered, that as the names after Kenneth are not the u&s;ual Piki&s;h names, &s;o neither are they the u&s;ual Dalriadic.

Yet the&s;e names are not Iri&s;h, tho, if &s;ome were, foreign cau&s;es might occa&s;ion them. For the churchmen, who were Iri&s;h, might, by per|mi&s;&s;ion of the parents, give Iri&s;h, names. Some of the kings might be married to Iri&s;h ladies, and the mothers, or their relations, impo&s;e the names. Iri&s;h names might become fa&s;hionable among the Piks, as the former were the learned people, and their language cultivated: &s;o Greek names became common in Ru&s;&s;ia, tho the Ru&s;&s;ians be not Greeks. La&s;tly, the Iri&s;h churchmen, and bards, might, as u&s;ual in the Celtic language, change the names to a Celtic &s;emblance. The&s;e cau&s;es con&s;idered, there would be little rea&s;on to wonder that the Piki&s;h kings of this period, after the Dalriads were united with the Piks, &s;hould vary a little in their names. But there is no need of the&s;e arguments here; for, after all, the names are much more Piki&s;h, than Iri&s;h or Dal|riadic. <HI>Donel</HI> was father of Garnad, 57th king of the Piks, and the name Domnail, or Donald, is Gothic, as indeed mo&s;t Iri&s;h names of kings
<PB N="164" REF="185">are: Domald was one of the ancient kings of Sweden. The <HI>Con&s;tantins</HI> are Piki&s;h: the fir&s;t Con&s;tantin king of the Piks in 792 is well known. <HI>Ed</HI> &s;eems the Piki&s;h Wid. <HI>Grig, Indulf, Odo, Culen, Grim,</HI> are all Gothic names, direct, and without Celtic vitiation. Thus only four names remain, <HI>Malcom, Duncan, Macbeth, Lulach.</HI> The former is &s;urely Piki&s;h; Brudi, the well|known Piki&s;h king, being &s;on of <HI>Mailcon:</HI> as for Celtic etymologies from Columba, &amp;c. they are dreams. <HI>Mal</HI> is Gothic, <HI>&s;peech; konr, a man;</HI> &s;o that the word &s;eems to imply an <HI>eloquent man,</HI> or perhaps a leader who directs the army by his words of command. There is no Malcom in the Iri&s;h or Dalriadic li&s;ts; and there is in the Piki&s;h. <HI>Duncan</HI> is the <HI>only</HI> name to be found in Dalriadic &s;tory, where is a Duncan Beg, king of Cantire. The Iri&s;h name is really Donchadh, pronounced Donca, &s;ometimes latinized Doncadius. Simeon of Durham, who wrote about 1164, calls our name Duncan, <HI>Dunecanus;</HI> and there is room to believe that this name is not the Iri&s;h Donchadh, tho the Highland &s;enachies confounded them. <HI>Dun</HI> is Gothic, <HI>a fort</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">It al&s;o means <HI>clamor,</HI> as our <HI>din. Duncan</HI> may therefore mean <HI>&s;trong voice,</HI> a nece&s;&s;ary matter in a barbaric leader.</NOTE>; <HI>kan, po&s;&s;um, valeo;</HI> and no Iri&s;h etymology can come &s;o near; and there is no proof that the name is Iri&s;h. As for the two remaining, <HI>Macbeth,</HI> and <HI>Lulach,</HI> the former is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed no name at all, as it &s;igni|fies only the &s;on of Beth. The <HI>Mac</HI> now u&s;ed was never anciently part of a fixt name, till &s;urnames aro&s;e in the eleventh century; but they did not reach Scotland till after the time of Malcom III. Our old writers call this king <HI>Macbeda;</HI> and <HI>Beth, Bed, Beda,</HI> are well known Ango-gothic names. The Highland &s;enachies &s;eem, in &s;corn of this u&s;urper, to have omitted his name, and to have called him the &s;on of Beth, &s;on of Finleg. Old
<PB N="165" REF="186">Engli&s;h writers call him <HI>Macbetad;</HI> and i que&s;tion if his name be not <HI>Maheth;</HI> or if the <HI>mac</HI> prefixt be not a fall of letters, not implying the Iri&s;h <HI>mac.</HI> The <HI>mac</HI> may be found in Gothic, nay in Latin names, as Macrinus, Macrobius; and i have heard of the later's being taken for a Scoti&s;h name. What &s;eems to confirm that Macbeth does not mean &s;on of Beth is, that his father was Finleg; and he is called <HI>Macbeth, filius Finleg,</HI> in our old li&s;ts. Now the grandfather's name is never put in the&s;e li&s;ts; and there &s;eems no room to believe it the ca&s;e here. In the Duan Mac|beth is called ab&s;olutely the &s;on of Finleg; and his name not put at his own reign. As to Lu|lach, his name is not found in the Celtic; and, if it were, may be found in the Gothic. Thus, tho to grant &s;ome of the&s;e names Celtic would not injure the que&s;tion, there is no occa&s;ion even for that conce&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, as the Iri&s;h churchmen and bards had, after the union of the Piks and Dal|riads, all the little learning of Pikland, and totally perverted it's hi&s;tory to their own fables; there is great room to believe, that, in &s;pite of all the&s;e fables, the Piks really conquered the Dalriads, and that the royal line continued Piki&s;h, as did by far the mo&s;t numerous, but unhappily the unlearned, part of the people. As for the name of <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> if we even granted them to originate in Pikland from the Dalriads, this al|lowance would not imply either conque&s;t, or &s;u|periority in numbers. For the Angli, tho finally vanqui&s;hed by the Saxons, and always far inferior to them in number, yet gave name to England.</P>
<P>So much for the two extremities of this que&s;|tion; namely, whether the Dalriads conquered the Piks, or the Piks the Dalriads. But neither of the&s;e extreme views &s;eems true; and there are medial views next to be con&s;idered, which have a ju&s;ter claim to attention. Let us fir&s;t con&s;ider the mo&s;t ancient authorities on the matter.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="166" REF="187">1. Nennius, as is well known from different chronological calculations in his work, wrote in 858. Samuel, who made additions to it, was his friend and cotemporary; and the authority of both is equal. An authority nearer the time can|not be expected. His words, ch. 5. are, <HI>Po&s;t in|tervallum annorum multorum, non minus</HI> DCCCC, <HI>Picti venerunt, et occupaverunt in&s;ulas quae Orcades vocantur. Et po&s;tea, ex in&s;ulis affinitimis, va&s;tave|runt non modicas et multas regiones; occupaveruntque, eas in &s;ini&s;trali plaga Britanniae; et manent u&s;que in hodiernum diem. Ibi tertiam partem Britanniae te|nuerunt, et tenent u&s;que nunc.</HI> "After an interval of many, not le&s;s than 900, years, the Piks came and &s;eized the ilands called Orkneys. And after|ward, from the neighbouring iles, wa&s;ted &s;everal not &s;mall regions; and &s;eized tho&s;e in the north part of Britain, and remain to this day. They held the THIRD part of Britain, and hold it now." No te&s;timony can be more explicit than this. Had the Dalriads conquered the Piks, could &s;o great an event have e&s;caped the notice of Nennius, living at the very time? Far from this, he rather witne&s;&s;es that the Piks had vanqui&s;hed the Dal|riads; for he mentions the former as lords of the northern THIRD of Britain, a term of divi&s;ion al|mo&s;t too large for Scotland. In another place Nennius, &s;peaking of the Orkneys, &s;ays, they are beyond the Piks: &s;o that the Piks retained all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the time of Nennius.</P>
<P N="2">2. King Alfred reigned from 872 till 900. In his tran&s;lations of Beda and Oro&s;ius, he u&s;es a paraphra&s;tic plan, and makes additions of his own. The Piks he frequently mentions by the names of <HI>Pehtar, Pihtar, Pyhtar, Peohtar;</HI> but drops not one hint of any alteration in their condition. This &s;ilence is &s;urely important, if not conclu&s;ive; for &s;o memorable an event as their conque&s;t could not have e&s;caped the king.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="167" REF="188">3. A&s;&s;er wrote his life of Alfred about the &s;ame time; and he mentions the Danes as ravag|ing the Piks in 875: but &s;ays nothing of any new &s;overeignty in Pikland.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Saxon Chronicle was written in the tenth and eleventh century. It mentions the Piks in 875, as A&s;&s;er; but has not a hint of any revolu|tion in Pikland. Ethelwerd and Ingulphus, wri|ters of the eleventh century, mention the Piks e&s;pecially, as warring under Con&s;tantin, their king, in 937.</P>
<P N="5">5. Tighernac wrote about 1088; and has pre|&s;erved many particulars concerning the Piks and Dalriads. The kings of the former he chronicles minutely, and exactly; but is quite &s;ilent as to any revolution in Kenneth's time. On the con|trary, he mentions the death of Kenneth, as 'king of the Piks.' Surely, as Innes ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, had he conquered the Piks, he would not have been called their king, but king of Pikland. But Tighernac marks his death in the very &s;ame words, which he u&s;es for all the other Piki&s;h kings. Nay, Tighernac calls the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Kenneth down to Donald, who died 899, kings of the Piks always. He &s;ays, '861, Donald M'Alpin, king of the Piks, died.' '875, Con&s;tantin M'Cinaoch, rex Pictorum moritur.' Donald the next he calls king of Albany.</P>
<P N="6">6. An old Iri&s;h tran&s;lation of Nennius, quoted by Lynch, gives us a li&s;t of the kings of the Piks from Brudi, &s;on of Meilocon 557; and goes on in con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to Malcom III. 1056, and after; making Kenneth &s;on of Alpin &s;ucceed the la&s;t Brudi, without one hint of any failure, or new line.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Welch writers are as ignorant of any revolution in Pikland as the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h; for Caradoc, who wrote about 1180, marks the death of Kenneth &s;imply as 'king of the Piks.'</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="168" REF="189">8. The Gaelic Duan gives no hint of any revo|lution in Kenneth's time.</P>
<P>Such are the genuine ancient authorities on this &s;ubject: and from them two conclu&s;ions follow.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That there was no conque&s;t or remarkable revo|lution in Pikland, under Kenneth, &s;on of Alpin; el&s;e it could not have e&s;caped all writers of Eng|land, Ireland, and Wales, the three neare&s;t coun|tries.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the&s;e ancient authors clearly te&s;tify, on the contrary, that there was not, by marking the Piks as in their old power in Kenneth's time, and long after; nay by putting Kenneth and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors as really kings of the Piks.</ITEM>
</LIST>
To op|po&s;e &s;uch late writers as Henry of Huntingdon and Giraldus, to tho&s;e early te&s;timonies, would be contrary to every rule of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Yet unhappily not one of the&s;e authorities &s;heds any light on the nature of Kenneth's &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion. The Duan, and our old li&s;ts, together with the regular inheritance after his time, &s;eem to im|ply that there mu&s;t have been &s;ome novelty. Per|haps prejudice may &s;till cling around me; but i mu&s;t confe&s;s that i am not bold enough to &s;ay that there was no change under Kenneth. So much &s;moke rai&s;es a &s;u&s;picion of &s;ome fire. As a Greek grammarian wi&s;hed to rai&s;e the gho&s;t of Homer, in order to learn the place of that poet's birth, i would de&s;ire to evocate the &s;hade of Ken|neth, that i might enquire how he came to the Piki&s;h throne. But let us u&s;e the means in our power to arrive at the highe&s;t probability, if not the truth of this event.</P>
<P>There are, &s;o far as i recollect, four ways in which a crown may be gained.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. By inheritance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By conque&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. By election.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. By u&s;urpa|tion. The three later ways &s;eem here out of the que&s;tion.</ITEM>
</LIST>
That there was no conque&s;t has been &s;hewn above. Had Kenneth been elected, it is hard to account for his e&s;tabli&s;hing the inheritance in his race; and election, as above &s;hewn, had cer|tainly
<PB N="169" REF="190">cea&s;ed in Pikland before Kenneth's time. For u&s;urpation we have no authority, nor even cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion; Kenneth was the &s;on of Al|pin, a king; and i know no example of u&s;urpation &s;o firm in the race of the u&s;urper, and void of competition: nor is there one hint in Tighernac, or other early authors, of any victory over the lawful king. There is therefore rea&s;on to infer that Kenneth became king of Pikland by inherit|ance.</P>
<P>Allowing this, only three que&s;tions can, in ap|pearance, ari&s;e on the &s;ubject.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If Kenneth was originally and merely king of the Piks, and had no connexion with the Dalriads?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If he was of the old Dalriadic line of kings of the Scoti&s;h or Iri&s;h &s;tem, and heir of Pikland by the female line?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If he was of a new Dalriadic line of Pik|i&s;h extract, and claimed the Piki&s;h throne by right of inheritance?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. If Kenneth was merely and &s;olely king of the Piks, it is hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to account for the old li&s;ts placing a remarkable revolution in his time. The Duan, and other pieces, put him in the Dalriadic &s;eries: Tighernac, Caradoc, the Iri&s;h tran&s;lator of Nennius, &amp;c. put him in the Piki&s;h. Nothing is more certain in our hi&s;|tory than that the kingdoms of Pikland and Dal|riada were united in his per&s;on. With all due contempt for Celtic perver&s;ion, it &s;eems violent to offer &s;uch outrage to all our old fragments of hi&s;tory, as to &s;ay that Kenneth was merely king of the Piks; and that no revolution happened in Pikland in his time.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Kenneth was not of the Dalriadic, Old Scoti&s;h, or Iri&s;h line, has been &s;hewn above. The poor fal&s;ifications, u&s;ed to connect him with that line, &s;ufficiently prove, to a candid enquirer, that he did not belong to it. The Iri&s;h Annals, certainly not bia&s;&s;ed again&s;t &s;uch a matter, afford convincing proofs again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ition. The

<PB N="170" REF="193">Gaelic Duan, written in the eleventh century, marks all the kings from Fergus and Loarn to Malcom III. 1056, as of the race of Erc. This only &s;hews that the Highland &s;enachies had u&s;ed the common Celtic &s;kill in fabricating genealo|gies; and that the elap&s;e of two dark centuries had encouraged their u&s;ual perver&s;ion of hi&s;tory. The Piks, a warlike and illiterate people, were taught by Iri&s;h churchmen to venerate their learn|ing. The new name of Scots, impo&s;ed before the Piks had any literature among them, and the name of Piks re&s;tricted to the inimical Galwegi|ans, made the old Piks de&s;pi&s;e and aboli&s;h the memory of their own power. Perhaps the Piks had quite different genealogies, before the new name of Scots turned their own &s;word again&s;t their own brea&s;t; and made them fight for the &s;u|periority of the Old Scots, their nominal ance&s;|tors. Such frenzy al&s;o occurred in French and Engli&s;h hi&s;tory; and prevails in it's highe&s;t rage at this day in the Scoti&s;h. But who is now &s;o weak as to regard a Celtic genealogy as hi&s;tory? A Celtic &s;enachy would build a genealogy of the Pope or the Great Mogul, up to Mile&s;ius, nay to Adam and beyond, <HI>&s;tans pede in uno.</HI> What can indeed be ea&s;ier than to make a li&s;t of names? With other nations a lineal de&s;cent fails in a few centuries; but with the Celts it endures for ever! There cannot be a &s;tronger proof of Celtic capa|city than their fondne&s;s for genealogy; a &s;cience unknown to, or de&s;pi&s;ed by, all other nations<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>Except the Greenlanders, who, as Crantz informs, can all repeat their genealogies for &s;everal generations. In the curious MS. lives of Welch &s;aints, Cotton lib. Ve&s;p. A. XIV. of the 12th or 13th cent. is a diverting &s;pecimen of genuine ancient Celtic genealogies. St. Cadoc is de&s;cended from Au|gu&s;tus, thus: Augu&s;tus <HI>genuit</HI> Octavianum, qui g. Tiberium, q. g. Gaium, q. g. Claudium, q. g. Ve&s;pa&s;ianum....Nero g. Trajanum, Trajanus g. Hadrianum, &amp;c. The reader may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that the others are of the &s;ame &s;tamp, tho not &s;o ea&s;ily convincible of fal&s;ehood.</P></NOTE>;
<PB N="171" REF="194">and when protracted, of &s;uch notorious uncertainty and fal&s;ehood, as to di&s;gu&s;t every &s;ound mind. It is well known what toil and indu&s;try it has co&s;t men of real learning, to detail a genealogy of the fir&s;t imperial and royal hou&s;es in Europe, even up to the twelfth century: how then lend any faith to an ignorant Celtic &s;enachy, utterly a &s;tranger to truth and hi&s;tory? O'Flaherty has been forced to cut and mangle the Iri&s;h genealogies at plea|&s;ure; becau&s;e the generations were too numerous; that is the genealogy was fal&s;e, for a defect in one link de&s;troys the whole chain at once. But to in&s;i&s;t on this would be to in&s;ult the reader's good &s;en&s;e, &s;o let us leave Celtic genealogies to Celtic under&s;tandings. From Tighernac, and other au|thentic writers, we know that the Iri&s;h genealogy of our kings is fal&s;e and ab&s;urd, as has been &s;hewn above; and that the name of Kenneth's grandfather is lo&s;t beyond redemption. From Tighernac, and the Annals of Ul&s;ter, we learn who were the late&s;t kings of the race of Erc, both in Argyle and Lorn; and know to a cer|tainty that Kenneth did not belong to that gene|alogy at all.</P>
<P N="3">3. After long and mature con&s;ideration of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, and revolving it in every point of view, as it's radical importance to our hi&s;tory de&s;erved, i am convinced, that the affirmative of the third que&s;tion can alone &s;olve every difficulty, and bear every weight of hi&s;toric truth; namely, That Kenneth was of a new Dalriadic line of Piki&s;h extract, and gained the Piki&s;h crown by inheritance. To confirm this, the following co|gent arguments ari&s;e.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In mere theory this opinion is the mo&s;t probable, as it is a medial one between two extremes above con&s;idered; namely, that Kenneth was merely king of the Piks, and that he was of the old Dalriadic race. Now tho it be true that truth is one extreme, and
<PB N="172" REF="195">fal&s;ehood another; and a medial opinion may, ab&s;tractly con&s;idered, be thought to be neither true nor fal&s;e; yet in human te&s;timony there is generally &s;uch a mixture of fal&s;ehood in truth, and of truth in fal&s;ehood, that the medial point has always been con&s;idered as that of truth, wi&s;dom, and virtue. <HI>Medio tuti&s;&s;imus ibis,</HI> is a maxim ap|plicable to hi&s;tory, as well as to life, and has been followed in doubtful points by mo&s;t writers of wi&s;dom and moderation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. But to pa&s;s from theory to facts we know, as above &s;tated, that Ungu&s;t, king of the Piks, totally conquered Dal|riada, and put its princes in chains about the year 740. And we know that after this neither the hou&s;e of Lorn, nor that of Argyle, held the &s;cep|tre of Dalriada, but that a new hou&s;e &s;ucceeded, inferrable to be Piki&s;h by every rea&s;on.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Even &s;uppo&s;ing that Ed Fin was not of Piki&s;h race, there are no le&s;s than eight other kings from Ed Fin to Alpin, who&s;e genealogy we know nothing of; and, not to dwell on the others, it is certain that Alpin and Kenneth are Piki&s;h regal names, and not Dalriadic: &s;o that there is rea&s;on to infer that Kenneth are his father, at lea&s;t, were Piki&s;h kings of Dalriada.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. This plain account &s;olves the various information we have concerning Ken|neth; &s;ome ancient writers calling him king of the Piks, while others put him in the Dalriadic line. Allow him to have been originally king of the Dalriads; and all is ea&s;y. Alpin and he had, as is mo&s;t likely, received the Dalriadic &s;ceptre in hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from Ed Fin, Piki&s;h monarch of Dalriada. The right which Kenneth had to the Piki&s;h crown is indeed ob&s;cure, for as to our mo|dern tale of Fergu&s;ia, daughter (or, as &s;ome more chronologically cook it, &s;i&s;ter) of Ungu&s;t II. king of the Piks, being wedded to Achy, father of Alpin, it is a mere romance of that king of forgers, Hec|tor Boyce. The very name <HI>Fergu&s;ia</HI> &s;peaks this;
<PB N="173" REF="196">and <HI>that</HI> Achy never exi&s;ted, as fully &s;hewn above. In 839 Uwen, or in Iri&s;h Eogan (pro|nounce Oan), &s;on of Ungu&s;t II. king of the Piks by inheritance, died. It would &s;eem, that, on the death of Uwen, two competitors aro&s;e for the Piki&s;h crown, Alpin the Dalriadic king, and Vered; but that the later carried it. That Vered dying in 842, Kenneth a&s;&s;erted his claim (his father Alpin being dead in 841), and, depo&s;ing Brudi &s;on of Vered, a&s;&s;umed the &s;ceptre. There was no national di&s;pute between the Dalriads and the Piks. Kenneth had no doubt a &s;trong party in Pikland; and the advantages of uniting the kingdoms mu&s;t have been very apparent, even in a rude age. The Engli&s;h heptarchies had been partly united by Egbert, twenty years before this; and the new inva&s;ions of the Danes called for the united force of Caledonia to oppo&s;e them. What was the claim of Alpin, and that of Vered, it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover: but both were palpably hereditary; for the &s;ons of both &s;ucceeded in Pikland, now an hereditary kingdom. Had this been a national war, the Dalriads could have done nothing, declining for three centuries as they had been, and utterly vanqui&s;hed in 743. But they would naturally a&s;&s;i&s;t Kenneth, and the favour which he, and his nearer &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;hewed them was natural. The con&s;tant hereditary form of their govern|ment, mu&s;t have rendered them &s;ubjects more to be tru&s;ted by the kings of Pikland; in which &s;tate that form of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was new, and not fixt on con&s;tant u&s;e, and the pro&s;cription of ages. Kenneth, and his ance&s;tors, as kings of Dalriada, apparently u&s;ed the Iri&s;h language; and the churchmen of Pikland were almo&s;t all Iri&s;h, &s;o that the Iri&s;h may have been long the fa&s;hionable language, as the French in England after the Norman conque&s;t. The Iri&s;h was then indeed
<PB N="174" REF="197">far &s;uperior to the Piki&s;h, as being a written, and of cour&s;e a more poli&s;hed and exact lan|guage.</ITEM>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. <HI>The Kings from</HI> 843 <HI>till</HI> 1056.</HEAD>
<P>THE chronology of this period is &s;ufficiently exact, and ea&s;ily adju&s;ted by computing the number of years each king reigned, according to the old li&s;ts and chronicles publi&s;hed by Innes, from the fixt date of the acce&s;&s;ion of Kenneth to the Piki&s;h throne, 843; or from the death of Macbeth, which, by unanimous con&s;ent of the ancient hi&s;torians, the Chronicle of Melro&s;e, &amp;c. happened in 1054. Fordun dates the acce&s;&s;ion of Kenneth 838; and has been blindly followed as u&s;ual by Boyce, Buchanan, &amp;c. and as this perver&s;ion threw back the reign of Kenneth &s;ix years, they have been forced to add the&s;e &s;ix years to the reign of Grig, making him reign eighteen years; while, by our old li&s;ts, he only reigned twelve. But the&s;e, and other &s;maller perver&s;ions did not de&s;erve &s;erious examination, as they are confuted by the chronology of Piki&s;h kings formerly given, and by the following chronology, compiled with minute attention and care.</P>
<P>Tho the chronology of our kings during this period be as exact as that of any kingdom in Europe at the time, yet the hi&s;tory is faint and ob&s;cure. That of Kenneth, and his eleven imme|diate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, appears to be&s;t advantage, being pre&s;erved in the brief but valuable <HI>Chronicon Pic|torum,</HI> publi&s;hed by Innes<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">And in the Appendix to vol.

<PB N="176" REF="199">from Con&s;tantin IV. 992, to Malcom III. 1056, or for a &s;pace of &s;ixty-four years, are in more ob|&s;curity. A few faint rays are however to be found in the li&s;t N^o IV. publi&s;hed by Innes; in that of the Regi&s;ter of Saint Andrew's N^o V.; in the <HI>Chro|nicon Elegiacum,</HI> publi&s;hed at the end of the Chro|nicle of Melro&s;e<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">And in the App. to this vol.</NOTE>; and in the Engli&s;h and I&s;lan|dic writers. As for Fordun, Boyce, Buchanan, and their late&s;t followers, they are to be con&s;idered as mere fablers, till the reign of Malcom III. 1056; and cannot be founded on, in the &s;malle&s;t particular before that period, being generally contradictory of our old monuments, and blend|ing even their truth with &s;uch fables as ob&s;cure the light of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Dalriadic &s;eries, tho hitherto built upon, has, as formerly &s;hewn in this work, no title to be regarded as that of the kings of North Britain. The Piki&s;h &s;eries has the &s;ole claim to that dig|nity. Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of James VI. to the Engli&s;h throne, it would have been ab&s;urd to con|&s;ider his ance&s;tors, the Scoti&s;h kings, as monarchs of England; or to drop the hi&s;tory of England for that of Scotland: and the ca&s;e is the &s;ame here. The reader, upon recurring to the li&s;t of Piki&s;h kings, will find that the reign of Kenneth was the &s;eventy-&s;eventh from the foundation of the Piki&s;h monarchy. Kings of the &s;ame name are numbered in the Piki&s;h &s;eries; thus there were two Kenneths, kings of Pikland, before the Dal|riadic Kenneth: and &s;o in other names.</P>

The Annals of Ul&s;ter &s;ay 857; but as to our hi&s;tory they often antedate by three or four years; thus Brudi's death is put 583 in&s;tead of 587; and &s;o in the re&s;t. That 860 was the real date is clear from the Piki&s;h chronicle, &s;o valuable for exact co-in|cidence with the Engli&s;h writers in other mat|ters: and from the eclip&s;e of the &s;un on the day of St. Cyriacus, 891, aftermentioned. Fordun's perver&s;ion of all chronology concerning Selvac, &amp;c. &s;hews his dates put at random; and that Tue&s;day &s;hould be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">3th of February in 854 is a mere chance: and the &s;ix years deficient were forced to be added to the reign of Grig, to make up the chronology, tho our old li&s;ts give him but 11 or 12, not 18 years. Kenneth died in his palace at <HI>Forthuir-tabacht (Ch. Pict.) Fortheviot (Ch.

<P>From the Regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's we learn that our kings, from Kenneth III. down to Edgar, 1098, were buried in Hyona or Icolmkill. After that period Dunfermlin was the place of royal &s;epulture.</P>
<P N="79">79. CONSTANTIN II. &s;on of Kenneth III. A. C. 864, reigned 16 years <HI>(Chr. Pict)</HI> 20 years (<HI>Chr. N^o</HI> II. <HI>Innes</HI>), but 18 &s;eems the real number; for 891 was the ninth year of Grig, as after &s;hewn. In his third year 866, Olave, leader of the Danes and Norwegians in Ireland, ravaged Pikland, from the day of the new year till that of St. Pa|trick, or 17th March, and carried off plunder and ho&s;tages. <HI>(Chr.

Fordun &s;ays Con&s;tantin was &s;lain by the Danes in a cave near Fifene&s;s; but the Annals of Ul&s;ter, and our be&s;t chronicle of the time <HI>(Chr. Pict.),</HI> are &s;ilent as to this.</P>
<P>This reign was the mo&s;t ruinous that North Britain ever beheld, or was to behold. The Piks had long enjoyed peace, or at lea&s;t freedom from foreign inva&s;ions; and a default in martial &s;kill and prowe&s;s was the natural con&s;equence. They were therefore unprepared for their Northern in|vaders, men inured to arms and perpetual war. After this reign the Piks changed the &s;cene, and generally repelled the invaders with great &s;laugh|ter. But during the reign of Con&s;tantin II. or from 864 till 882, the lo&s;&s;es Pikland &s;u&s;tained were not confined to booty and captives; but were great and permanent. For it is clear, from the mo&s;t ancient and authentic monuments of Scandi|navian hi&s;tory, that during this period the Nor|wegians &s;eized the Orkneys and Hebudes, with pre&s;ent Sutherland, Caithne&s;s, and mo&s;t of Ro&s;s|&s;hires, amounting in the whole to more than a fourth part of the Piki&s;h kingdom.

But it &s;eems be&s;t to reconcile all ac|counts by making this a joint reign. Who Grig was is ob&s;cure. The Regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's &s;ays it was he who &s;lew Ed: and he &s;eems to have pretended to govern in the name of Achy to &s;upport his u&s;urpation. Our old li&s;ts, and other writers, &s;ay that Grig (or Gregory, as they chri&s;ten him) was &s;on of Dungal, brother of Al|pin. But that &s;eems dubious. The Annals of Ul&s;ter are quite &s;ilent concerning Achy and Grig. The only thing known concerning this reign is, that in its ninth year, or 891, there was an eclip&s;e of the &s;un on the day of St. Cyriacus, or 8th Augu&s;t: which really did happen that year and day<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>'Ac in nono anno, ip&s;o die Cirici, eclip&s;is &s;olis facta|e&s;t."

The reign of Alfred is too bright to be ob&s;cured by a cloud of childi&s;h fable. The Danes and Norwegians held too &s;ure footing in Ireland for Grig to in|terfere.

This Hill of Credulity was &s;urely the Moothill near Scoon. In this reign died Donald, king of the Britons of Stratclyde; and Donald, &s;on of Ed, was elected king <HI>(Chr.

But that work often errs again&s;t chronology, and &s;eems a late forgery.</P></NOTE> <HI>(Chr. Pict)</HI> The Annals of Ul&s;ter give a long account of this memorable engagement. The Norwegians and Danes of Ireland, de&s;iring as would &s;eem fully to po&s;&s;e&s;s North Britain, as they did Ireland, formed a va&s;t army, and landed in North Britain. Con&s;tantin, fore&s;eeing the danger, had wi&s;ely formed an alliance with the Northern Saxons, as the Annals of Ul&s;ter call them, that is, the people of Northumbria, &s;till &s;eparated from the Engli&s;h under their Dani&s;h kings; who naturally &s;ought a&s;&s;i&s;tance from North Britain to &s;upport them again&s;t the kings of England, and were thus bound by reciprocal tyes. The enemy formed in four divi&s;ions: the fir&s;t commanded by God|fred;
<PB N="183" REF="208">the two next by different earls and chiefs: the fourth and la&s;t by Reginald. Con&s;tantin de|feated the three fir&s;t with great &s;laughter: but Reginald attacking him in the rear, the battle became dubious, when night put an end to the engagement. The Danes returned to Ireland, without effecting any thing; &s;o that the <HI>Chr. Pict.</HI> &s;ays not improperly that Con&s;tantin had the vic|tory. This engagement was &s;o great, that it is the only one particularly de&s;cribed in the Annals of Ul&s;ter, which generally only &s;ay there was a battle in &s;uch a place, between &s;uch a man and &s;uch another.</P>
<P>But the &s;econd conflict of Con&s;tantin was yet greater; and the Saxon Annali&s;t has even ri&s;en to poetry on the occa&s;ion. This was the famous battle of <HI>Bruneburg</HI> fought in the thirty-fourth year of Con&s;tantin <HI>(Chr. Pict.)</HI> that is 937, a computation exactly agreeing with the Saxon Chronicle, and Simeon of Durham. Athel&s;tan, king of England, having expelled Anlaff and Godfred, princes of Northumberland in 927 <HI>(Ann. Sax.),</HI> the former fled to Ireland; the later took refuge with Con&s;tantin. Con&s;tan|tin, &s;olicited by Athel&s;tan to give up Godfred, but dete&s;ting the treachery, advi&s;ed him to leave his kingdom; which he did, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by piracy for &s;ome years till he died. Athel&s;tan, re|&s;enting Con&s;tantin's conduct, in 934 (<HI>Ann. Sax. Sim. Dun.</HI> &amp;c.) attacked his dominions by &s;ea and land<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Simeon vel Turgot de Dun.

The Engli&s;h army and fleet after this revenge retired.

The We&s;t of England was all in the hands of the Bri|tons; but the allies by landing at Bruneburg, now, it is believed, Brugh on the Humber<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Simeon de Ge&s;t, &s;ays, this battle was fought at <HI>Wendune.</HI> Anlof landed in the Humber, <HI>Flo.

But that great prince, with uncommon prudence and &s;ucce&s;s, cru&s;hed the de&s;ign at once. Tho the allies brought no le&s;s than &s;ix hundred and fifteen &s;hips <HI>(Sim.)</HI> he was able to attack them on their landing; and after, as Milton ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, the greate&s;t and bloodie&s;t battle that this iland ever beheld, the allies were totally defeated. Five kinglets, and many celebrated chiefs, fell on the &s;ide of the allies. Con&s;tantin's &s;on was al&s;o among the &s;lain. He and Anlaf fled to their &s;hips and e&s;caped. The lo&s;s on Athel&s;tan's &s;ide mu&s;t al&s;o have been va&s;t; tho carefully concealed by old Engli&s;h hi&s;|torians. Certain it is, that he was too much weakened to di&s;turb his neighbours again; and died in 941, after pa&s;&s;ing his la&s;t years in peace.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantin &s;urvived this battle many years. In his extreme old age he retired to a mona&s;tery; and re&s;igned the kingdom to Malcom <HI>(C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r. Pict.)</HI> This happened in 944, and he died about 954.

<P>The wars of Malcom II. with the Danes are mentioned by our writers; but i know not if there be any ground for them at all. The hi&s;tory of Denmark and Norway is, at this period, very clear; but it is &s;ilent as to any de&s;cents on Scot|land. Indeed the fables of Boyce and Buchanan are &s;elf-confuted; for they repre&s;ent Swein, the Dani&s;h king of England, as carrying on the&s;e wars; and yet the &s;eat is always in Buchan and Moray. Fordun, tho he mentions one battle again&s;t the Norwegians, is quite &s;ilent as to tho&s;e wars; and &s;o is Winton. Major, in 1521, knew nothing of them. That infamous forger Boyce, 1526, fir&s;t &s;tarted this game; and, &s;truck with the obeli&s;ques he &s;aw in the north of Scotland, gives them and victories to Malcom II. Sigurd and Thorfin, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the north of Scotland, were in &s;trict amity with Malcom. Swein and Canute the Dani&s;h kings, 985&mdash;1035, were wholly occupied with England, and far from wi&s;hing to excite a new enemy. Saint Olave, king of Norway 1014&mdash;1030, carried on no &s;uch wars.

<P>The pretended laws of Malcom II. form ano|ther gro&s;s fable: and able writers have fully &s;hewn them a forgery. The &s;tory of the divi&s;ion of all the lands in Scotland at the Moothill is no|toriou&s;ly fal&s;e. If the feudal &s;y&s;tem was u&s;ed before in Scotland, as is mo&s;t probable, the idea is ab&s;urd. If not, no power, but that of conque&s;t, could force the people to &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion. The king was only lord of his own e&s;tate, of that part alloted for his maintenance: the other &s;ub|jects held their property as ab&s;olutely as he did. But it is now vain to confute &s;o idle a &s;tory. The foundation of the &s;ee of Murtlach, afterward re|moved to Aberdeen, is a&s;cribed to Malcom II. but Ruddiman who argues this becau&s;e Malcom conquered the Norwegians at Murtlach, accord|ing to our fables, only builds on the mire of fal&s;ehood<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><P>Fordun IV. 44. &s;ays, Malcom II. founded a bi&s;hopric 'apud Murthillach, non procul a loco quo, &s;uperatis Nor|vagen&s;ibus, victoriam obtinuit.'

In Scotland Murmor was the term, as above men|tioned. But who ever heard of an Abthane?

Some abbacies were &s;uperior to bi&s;hoprics in wealth; and mitred abbots equal to bi&s;hops in dignity. The marriage of churchmen was e&s;teemed as proper as that of others, in many kingdoms not yet infected with Roman &s;uper&s;tition and intrigue.

<PB N="194" REF="219">But it is very likely that the marriage took place before Malcom came to the throne. The French hi&s;tory, after Charlemagne, has many &s;uch in|&s;tances. Alfred the Great was the &s;on of Ethel|wulf who was a prie&s;t before he was crowned; and Alfred him&s;elf was bred up to the church, a circum&s;tance to which we owe that learning which perfected his tran&s;cendant character. The &s;ecular power and &s;pirit of the clergy, in the mid|dle ages, are well known. Even till the council of Rheims, 1148, monks might marry; and it co&s;t many a &s;truggle before the later popi&s;h &s;y&s;|tem took effect. The abbots were e&s;teemed ante|rior in dignity to nobles, for the charters run <HI>Epi&s;copis, Abbatibus, Comitibus,</HI> &amp;c. From St. Bernard's life of Malachy, <HI>cap.</HI> 7. it appears that the Archbi&s;hops of Armagh had &s;ucceeded heredi|tarily, for fifteen generations. In Charlemagne's time fourteen mona&s;teries of his empire furni&s;hed their proportion of &s;oldiers; and the abbots were the u&s;ual leaders. The chief of the republic of Genoa till 1339 was an abbot, <HI>Abbas Populi.</HI> In 982 we find the bi&s;hop of Aug&s;burg, and the abbot of Fulda, killed in the &s;ame battle. An abbot of Fontenelle a&s;&s;embled troops, and oppo&s;ed Charles Martel. Charlemagne, in a letter to Fra&s;tada, one of his wives, mentions a bi&s;hop who fought by his &s;ide. In the time of Louis Debonnaire we find the abbots of Corbie and St. Denis rai&s;ing troops. Hugh, &s;on of Charlemagne, was abbot of St. Quentin. The abbots of Fulda, St. Gal, Kempten, Corbie, in Germany, were all great princes. In modern times the Cardinals Gui&s;e, Retz, Richelieu, de la Valette, Sourdis, were all military men. Peter the Great of Ru&s;&s;ia was grand&s;on of the patriarch Feder Romanow, who cau&s;ed his &s;on Michael to be made Czar. In 757 we find a bull granted by the Pope to the abbot of St. Denis, allowing him to have a particular bi&s;hop in his mona&s;tery. In 977 John XIII. allowed
<PB N="195" REF="220">Diederic abbot of St. Vincent at Metz to wear pontifical ornaments. In the tenth century the emperor Otho made even dukes and counts va&s;|&s;als to the bi&s;hops and abbots of Germany. In Beda's time the mona&s;teries were often private property, belonging to a family; and the &s;ame men were abbots and captains. (<HI>Epi&s;t. ad Egbert.</HI> edit. Ware, 73&mdash;79.) The abbots appeared in the national council of England (Sax. Chr. 694. Ingulf. 855, M. Paris, 1210). At the time of the Reformation the mitred abbots, in the Engli&s;h parliament, were more numerous than the bi&s;hops. In Spain it is well known what power bi&s;hop Oppa, the &s;on of king Witiza, had at the time of the Moori&s;h inva&s;ion, 710.

<P>As the monks were all laymen till a late pe|riod, in Britain and Ireland till the eleventh cen|tury, it is no wonder that the abbots were lay|men. Du Cange mentions the <HI>Abba-Comites,</HI> who were often both earls and abbots<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><P>Abba Comites,

The Saga and Torfaeus tell us that Thor&s;in vanqui&s;hed this Kalius, and pur|&s;ued the victory even down to Fife. But this fa|ble needs only to be redd to be rejected. And &s;uch gro&s;s fictions &s;hew what might be expected, that tho&s;e Icelandic &s;agas, compiled from old ro|mantic poems, are mere romances, and claim lit|tle hi&s;toric faith. The marriage of Sigard to Malcom's daughter is therefore left to the reader's di&s;cretion. From Simeon of Durham we learn that, in 1035, Duncan be&s;ieged Durham without &s;ucce&s;s; and returning home was &s;lain by his people a &s;hort time after; that is, in 1037, by our chro|nology: whereas if we date his reign four years later, as u&s;ual, the expre&s;&s;ion of Simeon is erro|neous.

Leo the ninth a&s;cended the papal chair in 1049.

Large quantities of the coin of Canute have been found in Scotland; but &s;carce any of elder kings; and it is probable that Ca|nute's coin found this new path in Macbeth's time.

Leofric was earl of Mercia, and this affair happened during the commotions between Edward king of England, and the famous earl Godwin.

<P>From the Saxon Annals, Simeon of Durham, Roger Hoveden, William of Malm&s;bury, and in &s;hort all the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians of the period, it is certain that in the year 1054, Siward, earl of Northumbria, went with Malcom, heir of Scot|land, again&s;t Macbeth, and the battle en&s;ued in which Macbeth was &s;lain. They therefore who place this event in 1057, err again&s;t the cleare&s;t chronology, of one of the mo&s;t known events in ancient Engli&s;h hi&s;tory. By the con&s;ent of all the &s;ame Engli&s;h writers, and many unpubli&s;hed chro|nicles in the Cotton and Harleian libraries, Siward, earl of Northumbria, died in 1055. So that the matter admits of no doubt. The chronicle of Mal|ro&s;e perfectly agrees with the Engli&s;h accounts, and rightly dares the acce&s;&s;ion of Malcom III. in 1056. O&s;bern, elde&s;t &s;on of Siward, fell in the battle: and Brompton relates that Siward was forced in&s;tantly to return to Northumbria, to &s;up|pre&s;s a rebellion, where he died of a di&s;ea&s;e next year.

He, Leo|fric, earl of Mercia, and Godwin, earl of Kent, were powerful as kings; and, had they not ba|lanced each other, the throne of Edward, &s;o much &s;haken by Godwin, mu&s;t have fallen. Much fa|ble has attended the death of Macbeth; but all we know with certainty is, that it happened at Lunfanan, Aberdeen &s;hire <HI>(Reg. St. And.).</HI> The
<PB N="201" REF="226">old Engli&s;h writers, in their u&s;ual &s;tyle of u&s;urpation toward Scotland, &s;ay, that Siward, by Edward's command, &s;lew Macbeth, and placed Malcom on the throne. But this was not &s;o ea&s;ily done. Siward was dead before Malcom a&s;cended the throne; and there is room to doubt if Edward at all interfered, Malcom being kin&s;man of Siward, as &s;hall pre|&s;ently be explained.</P>
<P N="94">94. LULAC, A. C. 1054, reigned four months and a few days, as our old li&s;ts, publi&s;hed by Innes, bear. All we know concerning his de&s;cent is from one of the&s;e li&s;ts, which &s;ays that he was <HI>nepos filii Boide,</HI> 'grand&s;on of the &s;on of Boide.' Macbeth's queen was daughter of Bodhe. For|dun calls him <HI>con&s;obrinus,</HI> or cou&s;in-german of Macbeth; a mother's &s;i&s;ter's &s;on, or father's &s;i&s;|ter's &s;on. But, from the li&s;t, he mu&s;t have been the grand&s;on of Macbeth's queen's brother.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In the Annals of Ul&s;ter he is called Lulach Mac Gillcom|gain.</NOTE> That brother mu&s;t have been twenty or thirty years older than Gruoch his &s;i&s;ter. Lulac is &s;ur|named <HI>Fatuus,</HI> or the fool, in one of tho&s;e li&s;ts, and his relation to Macbeth was almo&s;t none. Yet he keeped the throne four months again&s;t Malcom, now left by Siward to manage his own bu&s;ine&s;s. Siward's army certainly followed him back to Northumberland, to &s;uppre&s;s the re|bellion there: and to the imbecillity and weak claim of Lulac was Malcom totally indebted for the throne. The chiefs and people of Scotland mu&s;t, of free con&s;ent, have preferred his title to that of Lulac; which was far wor&s;e, and reduced to nothing by the incapacity of its holder. The time employed &s;hews that deliberation was u&s;ed before Malcom's right was fully acknowleged; and he was not appointed king till the year 1056, after a deliberative inter&s;tice of an year, or an year and a half. In 1055, and 1056, Edward
<PB N="202" REF="227">of England was too much occupied with the war again&s;t Griffin and Algar, to attend to foreign matters: and there is no room to &s;u&s;pect that he interfered in Malcom's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; &s;o that the old Engli&s;h writers are as unlucky as u&s;ual in their u&s;urpations upon Scotland. To the con&s;ent and approbation of the Scoti&s;h chiefs and people, Malcom was &s;olely indebted for his dignity, due indeed to his heriditary right. Lulac was &s;lain at E&s;&s;eg in S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rathbogy by Malcom's adherents. <HI>Reg. St. And. Chron. Eleg.</HI> Both Macbeth and he were buried at Hyona, as well as the legal race. <HI>Ib.</HI></P>
<P N="95">95. MALCOM III. 1056. After this our hi&s;tory is clear: but &s;ome matters concerning this reign require notice. Sir David Dalrym|ple, following Fordun, &s;ays Malcom began his reign on the day of St. Mark, or 25 April, 1057. But Fordun &s;ays he was crowned on that day (tho from Icelandic writers it appears that no king of Scotland was crowned, even in the thir|teenth century<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Torf. Norv. IV. 289, &amp;c.</NOTE>, and he might be anointed, and proclaimed king the year before, even by For|dun's account. But the fact is, that Fordun, by an erroneous chronology, as above &s;hewn in many places, begins the reign of Macbeth in 1040, and extends his &s;eventeen years to 1057: whereas, not to repeat other errors, we know to a certainty that Macbeth was &s;lain in 1054. This part of the chronicle of Melro&s;e, written in the twelfth century, which i have con&s;ulted in the original in the Cotton Library, dates the acce&s;&s;ion of Malcom, M. LVI. as plain as po&s;&s;ible. And no man will prefer the te&s;timony of Fordun, a mo&s;t weak and fabulous writer, who wrote two whole centuries after, and who&s;e work was interpolated, and not publi&s;hed till 1440, to the cotemporary veracity of the chronicle of Melro&s;e. But another argument annuls all doubt. For Malcom III. was
<PB N="203" REF="228">certainly &s;lain near Alwick, 6 June, 1093. Now by ALL our old li&s;ts he reigned 37 years, and &s;ome months. So that his reign mu&s;t of cour&s;e have begun in 1056. As to Fordun's date, it is but one of the many forgeries of that weak writer: and to &s;et his authority again&s;t &s;ix or &s;even, more ancient, would be the heighth of ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>Another point is, that Malcom III. is commonly reputed &s;on of Duncan, king of Scotland; but there is room to &s;u&s;pect that he was his grand|&s;on. Florence of Worce&s;ter<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Malcolmum regis Cumbrorum filium&mdash;regem con&s;tituit (Siwardus) <HI>&s;ub A.</HI> 1054.</NOTE> and Roger Hoveden, who wrote in the twelfth century, &s;ay Malcom III. was &s;on of the king of Cumbria. Duncan was &s;lain in 1037. Malcom is then repre&s;ented as a man who &s;led to England for protection. Put his age 20: when he died he was 76. A great age to go to battle at! and yet his great age has to|tally e&s;caped our writers. Nay, David I. younge&s;t &s;on of Malcom III. a&s;cended the throne in 1124, and died 1153. David I. could not be more than 70 when he died; and, if &s;o much, was born in 1083. and Malcom III. was aged 66, when he begot him. All this is &s;trange and &s;u&s;picious. But if we allow Malcom the grand&s;on of Duncan, all is well: and the authority of the above wri|ters reconciled. Duncan, grand&s;on of Malcom II. was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cumberland by him, be|fore his death. <HI>Wil. Malm&s;.</HI> Malcom II. was up|ward of eighty when he died, as Fordun &s;ays. His grand&s;on Duncan may have ea&s;ily been between thirty and forty when he a&s;cended the throne, and may have a&s;&s;igned Cumberland as u&s;ual to a &s;on of his, al&s;o named Duncan, and arrived at man's e&s;tate. When Duncan the father was &s;lain, this Duncan, called king of Cumbria by Flo|rence and Hoveden, was unmole&s;ted by Macbeth; who had no immediate heir, and was content
<PB N="204" REF="229">with his other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. This Duncan of Cum|bria, from weakne&s;s, &s;ickline&s;s, or becau&s;e of no equal aid, died without being able to a&s;&s;ert his claim to Scotland. But his &s;on Malcom, &s;urely not above 24 years of age when he a&s;cended the throne, had his right a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Siward his rela|tion, who by degrees had acquired great power. Malcom III. is repre&s;ented as a young man on his coming to the crown, and on his marriage with Margaret. Moreover Duncan, father of Malcom, was married to a daughter (more likely to a &s;i&s;ter) of Siward, as all agree; and this could hardly be Gruoch, who, as Winton &s;ays, became wife of Macheth after Duncan's death. The Duan al&s;o implies that Duncan, father of Malcom III. was not Duncan king of Scotland, for it gives them different epithets, calling the king <HI>Donnchadh ghlain gaoith,</HI> 'Doncha the Sweet-breathed;' and Malcom <HI>Mee Donnchaidh datha drechvi,</HI> '&s;on of Doncha the Agreeable.' The two Duncans were ea&s;ily confounded in genealogies: but it is be|lieved the reader will &s;ee grounds to infer that Malcom III. was &s;on of Duncan king of Cum|bria, &s;on of Duncan king of Scotland.</P>

<P>THIS &s;ubject falls into two parts: I. The lo&s;s of Caithne&s;s, the Orkneys, and Hebudes II. The acqui&s;itions on the &s;outh.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part properly belongs to our con&s;ide|ration of the Norwegians in Scotland, (Supple|ment, Section II.) where it is &s;hewn that the lo&s;s of all the above mentioned po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions happened about the year 880.</P>
<P>The &s;econd part, concerning the &s;outhern ac|qui&s;itions, is one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting articles of early Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory; and mu&s;t be con&s;idered here.</P>
<P>In Part III. ch. 9. it has been &s;hewn that, in 685, the Piks recovered LOTHIAN, or all the &s;outh ea&s;t part of Scotland from the Forth to the Tweed, after it had been held by the Angli of Northum|bria for about a century. No trace can be found in any old Engli&s;h writer that the Angli ever re|gained Lothian; and Beda expre&s;ily &s;ays that when he wrote, or in 731, the Piks maintained the acqui&s;ition. But the Angli retained the &s;outh of Galloway; where Candida Ca&s;a was &s;till theirs in Beda's time, as was Malro&s;e on the ea&s;t. It would &s;eem from Beda that Cuningham, on the we&s;t of Galloway, al&s;o belonged to Northumbria in his time; and his continuator &s;ays that, in 750, Edbert king of Northumbria added <HI>Campum Cyil,</HI> which appears to be Kyle, to his dominions. Stratclyde remained a petty kingdom till about
<PB N="206" REF="231">970, when conquered by the Piks: but in 756 it paid homage to Edbert the Northumbrian, and Ungu&s;t the Piki&s;h king.</P>
<P>The later part of the hi&s;tory of Northumbria is ob&s;cure: but certain it is that dome&s;tic broils, and the arrival of the Danes at the beginning of the ninth century, mu&s;t have effectually prevented any enlargement of the Northumbrian territory, in the Anglic times. The Dani&s;h period of Northum|brian hi&s;tory remains to be con&s;idered; and is un|happily yet more ob&s;cure than the Anglic. But there is not a &s;hadow of proof that the Dani&s;h kingdom of Northumbria 860&mdash;953 ever reached beyond the Tweed; far le&s;s that the earldom of Northumbria, 953 till 12th cent. exceeded that boundary. It, on the contrary, is evident from all &s;uch te&s;timonies as remain, that York was the &s;eat of the Dani&s;h kings, and earls of Northumbria; and the parts on the north bank of the Humber their prime domain. A&s;&s;er and others &s;ay, the Danes, 875, &s;ettled on the Tine, and thence wa&s;ted the Piks and Stratclyde Wel&s;h. Richard of Hexham, who wrote about 1180 in Northum|bria, expre&s;&s;ly &s;ays, that Northumbria reached from Humber to Tweed; and that Deira extend|ed from Humber to Tei&s;e, Bernicia from Tei&s;e to Tweed. Roger of Che&s;ter tells that Kenneth, a&s;cending the Piki&s;h throne, acquired all the ter|ritory down to the Tweed.</P>
<P>After the failure of the Anglic monarchy of Northumbria, not a trace can be found that either Angli or Danes held any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the &s;outh of pre&s;ent Scotland. The Piks of Galloway threw off the Anglic yoke, on the failure of that monar|chy; and before 840 we find them mentioned as an independent people. After 685 the Angli lo&s;t all the country north of Tweed: and, far from recovering any part, they &s;oon after lo&s;t all the territory between Tweed and the Cheviot hills, and Solway frith. Kenneth III. as above &s;tated,
<PB N="207" REF="232">burned Dunbar and Melro&s;e, <HI>u&s;urpata,</HI> which had been 'u&s;urped' by the Angli. This word &s;hews that Lothian, or the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Scotland, be|tween Forth and Tweed, was regarded as a po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Piki&s;h crown; and a &s;ettlement, or two, of the Angli as u&s;urpations. In 934 Athel|&s;tan wa&s;ted Scotland even to Dunfeodar and Wer|termore. The&s;e names unhappily cannot be ad|ju&s;ted.</P>
<P>Goodal, in the be&s;t chapter of his work<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Introd. ad Fordun.</NOTE>, has &s;hewn that U&s;her, Carte, Innes, and others, have fallen into gro&s;s ertors, by mi&s;taking <HI>Scotti&s;wath</HI> for <HI>Scotti&s;watre.</HI> The former, as Fordun unde|&s;ignedly tells us in two places, is Solway frith: the later is perfectly known to be the frith of Forth. Indeed <HI>wath,</HI> or <HI>wade,</HI> implies a ford<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In German <HI>Twat, brevia &s;eu vada.</HI> Jun. Batavia, p. 127.</NOTE>: while <HI>watre</HI> means a &s;mall &s;ea, or limb of the &s;ea. This error abridged the dominions of Scotland of all the tract between Solway frith and Forth: and is of ancient &s;tanding, for Giraldus in his <HI>De&s;crip|tio Albaniae</HI> falls into it; and taking <HI>Scotti&s;wath</HI> for <HI>Scotti&s;watre,</HI> makes the Forth the boundary be|tween England and Scotland in his time; which is &s;o notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e as to de&s;erve no notice. The &s;ame <HI>Scotti&s;wath</HI> is al&s;o called <HI>Myreford</HI> by old Engli&s;h writers.

John of Wallingford mentions the <HI>Ca&s;trum Puel|larum</HI> as at the northern extremity of Northum|bria. This name our writers apply to Edinburgh. It is a mere tran&s;lation of the name of <HI>Dumfries: Dun-Fres; Dun,</HI> ca&s;tellum, urbs; <HI>Fru, Fre,</HI> virgo nobilis, <HI>Icelandic.</HI> This was the name given by the Piks, while the Cumri of Cumbria called the &s;ame place <HI>Abernith,</HI> as it &s;tands at the mouth of the Nith.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that the&s;e erratic coincidences puzzled, and mi&s;led, even early Engli&s;h writers, who generally lived far from Northumbria, and were utter &s;trangers to it. Richard of Hexham, a Northumbrian, therefore de&s;erves more credit than them all put together; and he marks the Tweed as the northern boundary of Northumbria.</P>
<P>Lothian, or the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Scotland, therefore never belonged to the Engli&s;h after the year 685; but was always a Piki&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Old Engli&s;h writers agree as to Cumberland being given up by Edmund to Malcom in 945; but as to <HI>Lothene</HI> they differ widely. Some &s;ay Edgar gave it to Kenneth about 975; but they are late writers. Simeon of Durham, an early writer, &s;ays, Eadulf Cudel gave it up to the Scots, in terror, about 1020. But before judging of this the reader mu&s;t di&s;cu&s;s what country is meant by <HI>Lothene:</HI> for names vary much; and there is proof that this Lothene was not pre&s;ent Lothian; nor <HI>London,</HI> formerly the name of a tract between Lanerk&s;hire and Air&s;hire.</P>

There is great rea|&s;on to believe that the pre&s;ent county of North|umberland was anciently called Lothene, or Lo|den, before the great name of Northumbria, which anciently included all England north of the Hum|ber, was re&s;tricted to that petty county.

There is therefore ground to infer that the whole country, from the Tine and Newca&s;tle up to the Forth, was anciently called <HI>Lothene;</HI> that name being thus as exten&s;ive as that of Galloway, which once extended from Glyde to Solway. But as the name of Galloway gradually dimini&s;hed, and pa&s;t &s;outh; &s;o that of Lothian, like that of Northumberland, gradually dimini&s;h|ed, and pa&s;&s;ed north: the former being a Scoti&s;h term, the later an Engli&s;h; and, as &s;ociety ad|vanced, and &s;maller divi&s;ions aro&s;e, the vague term gradually pa&s;&s;ed to the extremities. Ptolemy and Richard mark the Ottadeni, or old inhabitants of Lothian, as reaching from Bodotria, or the Forth down to the river Tine, and wall of Gallio. Thus the country, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by one people, might well receive one name. But the Saxon Chronicle, by the &s;pecial and remarkable term, 'Lothene <HI>on England,</HI>' Lothian <HI>in England,</HI> al&s;o implies that there was, 'Lothene <HI>on Pihtland,</HI>' Lothian in Pikland. El&s;e why this peculiar ad|junct <HI>in England,</HI> for there is no example in that work, or any other monument of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory,
<PB N="211" REF="238">where the name of a country is put, with the ad|junct that it was in England; a ridiculous informa|tion, if not a nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction. The pre&s;ent name of Northumberland is quite a late one, and that county it&s;elf is omitted in Dome&s;day book, with Cumberland and We&s;tmoreland<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P>The counties omitted in Dome&s;day are Northumberland, Cumberland, We&s;tmoreland; Durham, which &s;eems to have been church-land, the <HI>patrimonium Sancti Cuthberti;</HI> and Lanca|&s;hire is put under York&s;hire and Che&s;hire.</P></NOTE>; all then not belonging to England, but to Scotland. Old Northumberland was chiefly York&s;hire, being the country immediately north of the Humber. This was called Deira; while pre&s;ent Durham, bound|ed by the Teis on the &s;outh, formed the chief part of Bernicia, as appears from the be&s;t authority, that of Simeon of Durham. The tract from the Tine to the Forth, or between the walls, was in Roman times a va&s;t march, and regarded as one uniform territory; &s;o that its having after but one name was a matter of cour&s;e. But after the Piks had &s;eized all down to the Tweed, its general name fell into two divi&s;ions, Piki&s;h and Anglic, Engli&s;h Lothian and Piki&s;h Lothian; as we &s;ay French Netherlands, Au&s;trian Netherlands, Dutch Netherlands. Beda calls Piki&s;h Lothian the <HI>pro|vincia Pictorum,</HI> of which Trumwin was bi&s;hop; and the name of Pentland hills, or Pikland hills, al&s;o marks it peculiarly a Piki&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. When a matter is univer&s;ally known in their own times, writers never explain it for the &s;ake of po&s;terity; and it is well known what ob&s;curity this practice throws on parts even of Greek and Roman hi&s;tory. Thus the old Engli&s;h writers thought it needle&s;s to explain the difference between the Engli&s;h and Piki&s;h Lothian; when all the readers of their own days mu&s;t have &s;een at once which was meant. The break in Engli&s;h hi&s;tory al&s;o occa&s;ions ob&s;cu|rity, for William of Malm&s;bury ob&s;erves that, from Beda's time to his, that is, from the eighth till
<PB N="212" REF="239">the twelfth century, no general writer had ari&s;en; and this period is unfortunately the mo&s;t ob&s;cure, and on which we want mo&s;t light, as the pa&s;&s;age from ancient to modern times. To proceed: in 1018 an <HI>Eugenius Calvus rex Lutinen&s;ium</HI> is men|tioned, as a&s;&s;i&s;ting Malcom II. at the battle of Carrum. This is the only time that a king of this people is mentioned; and it is difficult to conceive the meaning of this &s;ingular in&s;tance. He &s;eems a titular king, whom Malcom &s;upported again&s;t the earl of Northumberland, in his claim for the Engli&s;h Lothen, or pre&s;ent Northumberland; but his title was lo&s;t with the battle of Carrum, and we read no more of him. Let me only ob&s;erve further that, by all accounts of the old Engli&s;h writers, Cumberland was given up to Scotland long before Lothene was; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive that, when Cumberland was given up, the Scots were not al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the adjacent territory on the north. All accounts imply that Cumberland was then contiguous to the Scoti&s;h dominions: and Galloway was an independent country till the twelfth century<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See Dalrymple's Annals. Mat. Paris, 1250, &s;ays, "Bri|tannia quae complectitur Scociam, Galeweiam, et Walliam." Gough's Topog. I. 62.</NOTE>. It follows that the Scots, when they acquired Cumberland, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of pre&s;ent Scotland down to Solway frith. The Lothian, afterward given up, mu&s;t of cour&s;e have been the <HI>Lothene on England,</HI> or pre&s;ent Northumberland.</P>
<P>But other circum&s;tances remain to be con&s;ider|ed. It was rather unfair in the Scoti&s;h writers, who a&s;&s;ert Lothian as a part of Scotland, to con|ceal the te&s;timony of the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem</HI> on this &s;ubject; as, at fir&s;t glance, it &s;eems to favour the Engli&s;h claim. For certain it is that this work excludes Laodonia and Galwegia, as Sir James Dalrymple<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Collections, p. 141, 218.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, as not parts of Scot|land.
<PB N="213" REF="240">In ch. 8. it mentions, as two di&s;tricts, the <HI>Citra Mare Scoticum,</HI> and the <HI>Ultra in Laodonia.</HI> And, even in the reign of David II. 1330&mdash;1370, there was a <HI>Ju&s;ticiarius ex parte Boreali,</HI> and a <HI>Ju&s;|ticiarius Laodoniae</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid, from an ancient charter. The <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem</HI> is no doubt an Engli&s;h work: but the pa&s;&s;ages concerning Scotland have been in&s;erted at an early period.</NOTE>. Lothian being thus put as di&s;tinct from Scotland, it may be &s;aid that it mu&s;t of cour&s;e have been regarded as part of England.</P>
<P>It is an&s;wered that, by the &s;ame rule, Nor|thumberland, Durham, Cumberland, We&s;tmor|land, mu&s;t be regarded as part of Scotland, be|cau&s;e omitted in Dome&s;day book. Caithne&s;s and Sutherland are omitted in the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem,</HI> becau&s;e &s;ubject to the Norwegians: as for the &s;ame cau&s;e are the Orkneys, Hebudes, Argyle, and Lorn.

The <HI>De&s;criptio Albaniae</HI> confirms this extent of Scotland <HI>proper,</HI> in the twelfth century. But tho the Orkneys, Caithne&s;s, Sutherland, are omitted, becau&s;e &s;ubject to the Norwegian earls of Orkney; and the Hebudes, Argyle, and Lorn, becau&s;e &s;ubject to the Norwegian kings, or lords of the Iles; and Galloway, as having its own princes: it follows not that Lothian is omitted as &s;ubject to England. In the next chapter it is &s;hewn that the term <HI>Scotia</HI> was at fir&s;t yet more confined in North Britain; and it did not extend to Lothian till a late period. But tho the <HI>Mare Scoticum,</HI> or Frith of Forth, divided Lothian from Scotland <HI>proper,</HI> yet it was ever after the year 685 regarded as &s;ubject to the Piki&s;h or Scoti&s;h mo|narchs.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="241">So much for a Lothian in England: and i hope the reader will do me the ju&s;tice to believe that, had not there been proofs that the Lothian given up to Scotland, was not pre&s;ent Lothian, i would, with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure, have fought for truth again&s;t the prejudices of my countrymen. But, upon full examination, the prejudice here appears to be on the other &s;ide, and to re&s;t with the&s;e weak writers, Carte, and others, who have hither|to conde&s;cended to treat Engli&s;h hi&s;tory. When Engli&s;h talents, &s;o long wa&s;ted on foreign affairs, are applied to Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, this point, with many others, may be &s;tript of prejudice; and ap|pear in the light that ability lends to truth. It is a matter of the mere&s;t curio&s;ity, and of no more im|portance than Stephen's holding his crown of the Pope; &s;o that he mu&s;t be weak indeed who blends prejudice with it on either &s;ide. For my own part, i have peculiarly guarded my&s;elf again&s;t prejudice in favour of Scotland, tho i am al&s;o by no means prejudiced again&s;t that country: but had i not met with the above ob&s;tacles, i &s;hould &s;urely have inferred that the Scoti&s;h Lothian was the only one known to, or meant by, old Engli&s;h hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>As to the Scoti&s;h Lothian, it is al&s;o known by that name to Engli&s;h writers. Roger Hoveden mentions <HI>Dunbar cum adjacentibus terris in Lodo|nies,</HI> 'Dunbar with the adjacent lands in Lothian.' Its people are the <HI>Lodonen&s;es,</HI> who make &s;o great a figura in the famous War of the Standard, 1138. It is very remarkable that the old hi&s;torians of this war mention as in the army of David king of Scotland, along with Cumbren&s;es, Nordanum|bren&s;es, Galweien&s;es, Laodunen&s;es, and &s;uch large names, the <HI>Tevidalen&s;es,</HI> or men of Teviotdale. This noted tract is very &s;mall, but lying between the Engli&s;h and Scoti&s;h Lothian, its people, before the Engli&s;h Lothian was given up to the Scots, had from con&s;tant border-war acquired great &s;kill in arms, which they retained to a late period. It
<PB N="215" REF="242">is therefore no wonder that they are thus emi|nently di&s;tingui&s;hed, and &s;pecially named; tho they formed a part, and a very &s;mall one, of the Lodonen&s;es.</P>

This acqui|&s;ition preceded that of Lothene in time, but the train of circum&s;tances required to elucidate the later induced me to con&s;ider it fir&s;t, e&s;pecially as this of Cumberland is clear and po&s;itive. Innes and Carte have indeed confu&s;ed this plain fact, by mi&s;taking the two kingdoms of Strat|clyde and Cumbria, for one and the &s;ame. But as this error has been fully detected in the &s;econd part of this work, it is needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t on a matter &s;o clear from all the old Engli&s;h writers, as that the Cumberland given up to Scotland, was pre&s;ent Cumberland with We&s;tmoreland. In the Doom&s;day Book both the&s;e counties are omitted, as well as pre&s;ent Northumberland; be|ing not &s;ubject to England, but to Scotland. As for the kingdom of Stratclyde, who&s;e capital was Dumbarton, it was palpably &s;ubdued by the Scots about 970, after which it is never men|tioned, as formerly explained at great length. Both Cumberland and Lothene were re&s;tored by Malcom IV. to Henry II. but it is perfectly known that Scotland had, after that reddition, the very &s;ame bounds as now; as the old Engli&s;h hi&s;torians in pa&s;&s;ages innumerable fully evince. This fact is &s;o broad and clear, as to render all further arguments on the &s;ubject unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It is proper to add a few words on the pre|tended homage paid by the kings of Scotland to tho&s;e of England during this period. The &s;itua|tion
<PB N="216" REF="243">of the&s;e two kingdoms in the &s;ame iland was &s;uch as naturally to &s;ugge&s;t to the writers of the larger and more powerful an idea of inferiority and dependance in the &s;maller, which had no neigh|bour to &s;upport it. As there was al&s;o no other field of glory for England but Scotland, the wars with France being all po&s;terior to the Norman Conque&s;t, tho&s;e writers who wi&s;hed to adorn any &s;aintly king with hi&s;toric fame, generally drew upon the Scoti&s;h bank. This practice appears &s;o early as the reign of &s;aint O&s;wald king of Northumber|land, about the year 640, who is termed <HI>Impera|tor totius Britanniae,</HI> even by a Dalriadic writer Cuminius; who, &s;en&s;ible of the in&s;ignificance of the Dalreudini in Britain, adds Pikland <HI>gratis</HI> to O&s;wald's empire. This ri&s;ible title of a king of Northumberland, during the heptarchy, the other &s;ix kingdoms of which, not to &s;peak of Pikland, certainly never acknowleged any &s;uch claim, only &s;erves to &s;hew the &s;pirit of the&s;e pious authors; who &s;eem to have thought that all hu|man truth was to be &s;acrificed to &s;ainthood, a matter of faith. For as rea&s;on alone is the judge and guardian of truth, and in tho&s;e ages faith, or blind credulity, was con&s;idered as above human rea&s;on, it nece&s;&s;arily followed that the more fal&s;e any miracle or tale was, yet if it concerned a &s;aint, there was the more merit in believing it. <HI>Credo quia impo&s;&s;ibile e&s;t.</HI> The &s;ource of the&s;e mock honours of Saint O&s;wald is therefore &s;o pal|pable, that it becomes needle&s;s to remark, that if the other kings in Britain acknowleged his &s;u|periority, it mu&s;t have been in his &s;aintly charac|ter, for he fought not one battle again&s;t the Piks; or any of the heptarchic kings, except that again&s;t Penda king of Mercia, in which O&s;wald was &s;lain. There is however rea&s;on to conclude, as mentioned Part III. ch. 9, that O&s;wi, king of Northumbria, 658, actually vanqui&s;hed the Piks,
<PB N="217" REF="244">and that they paid tribute to the Northumbrian kings till 685, when Brudi IV. conquered and &s;lew Egfrid.</P>
<P>Such is the only claim of the kingdom of Northumbria upon Pikland: and it de&s;erved mention here, before proceeding to the period, e&s;pecially under view, from 843 till 1056. The kingdom of Northumbria, which alone could pretend any &s;uch miracle as to Pikland, &s;oon after declined before the Piki&s;h power, and be|came at la&s;t a prey to the Danes about 843. The Dani&s;h kings of Northumbria till 953, and the earls after, certainly were not &s;aints; and accord|ingly we find no claim of theirs upon the homage of North Britain. Let us therefore pa&s;s to tho&s;e of the kings of England.</P>

<P N="1">1. The Saxon Chronicle &s;ays, that, in 924, Ed|ward the Elder went to <HI>Bedecanwillan</HI> in Pikland, where he built a &s;trong town on the borders; and the king of Scots honoured him as &s;overeign, to|gether with the whole Scoti&s;h nation. Edward was certainly a great and victorious monarch, and &s;ubjected Northumbria for a time: but Con&s;tan|tin III. king of Pikland, was certainly not a monarch capable of gratuitous conce&s;&s;ions, as his after conduct to Athel&s;tan evinces. As he was him&s;elf harra&s;&s;ed by the Danes, and had van|qui&s;hed Reginald in 923, or ju&s;t the year before this &s;uppo&s;ed homage, it might be that he met Ed|ward to form a league again&s;t the common enemy. The <HI>Chron. Pictorum,</HI> tho particular concerning this king's reign, is quite mute as to this inter|view; and the circum&s;tance, that <HI>all the Scots</HI>
<PB N="218" REF="245">joined in the homage, &s;eems &s;ufficient to &s;tamp it as a mere glorious fable.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Athel&s;tan ravaged Scotland in 934 is certain; and it is po&s;&s;ible that Con&s;tantin paid him &s;ome &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but as to homage for his kingdom we have only the evidence on one &s;ide; and certainly no ju&s;t man would judge, upon hearing only one party. Nay the Engli&s;h writers &s;eem to confute them&s;elves, for they &s;ay that in 945, eleven years after this homage, Edmund gave Cumberland to Malcom I. on condition of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in his wars; whereas, had Scotland been under homage to England, its king was &s;urely bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t England in war, without &s;o large a pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="3">3. Edred ravaged Northumberland 950, but as to the gratuitous &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Scots it is hard to believe. Even Northumbria was not yet &s;ub|ject to England, but furni&s;hed its kings full em|ployment. It is &s;urely then mo&s;t improbable that, with &s;uch a &s;creen between them, the Scots &s;hould be &s;uch cowards. Their oppo&s;ite conduct, in the clear part of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, &s;hews the im|po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch eternal da&s;tardly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. If we credit Engli&s;h writers, no king of England could make war on Northumbria, but the Scoti&s;h king paid gratuitous homage. Who can believe this? The je&s;t is carried &s;o far, and repeated &s;o often, that it becomes &s;tale. How comes it that not one king of Scotland was ever cited to ap|pear in England, before his liege lord, to whom appeals lay? But as to this in&s;tance, and the three following, the ce&s;&s;ion of Cumberland to Scotland in 945 by Engli&s;h accounts re&s;tricts the homage paid, to be for Cumberland, not for the kingdom. The kings of England paid homage to France, for their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in France; but what &s;hould be &s;aid to a French writer, who would pretend that homage to be for England?</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="219" REF="246">4. Edgar founded no le&s;s than 48 religious hou&s;es: and the tales of eccle&s;ia&s;tic writers, con|cerning him, are therefore much to be &s;u&s;pected of panegyric. The &s;tory of his being rowed in a barge on the Dee, by eight tributary kings, is a palpable monki&s;h legend; and may perhaps be &s;till found to be borrowed from a &s;imilar circum|&s;tance in &s;ome old romance. From the Saxon Chronicle it is clear that &s;ix petty kings met Edgar, to make an alliance, not to pay homage. This will lead any man of candour to &s;u&s;pect that when a king of Scotland entered into a league with England, the monki&s;h writers, &s;trangers to human affairs, always dreamed of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and homage. The reign of Edgar was quite peaceable; and, &s;tripped of monki&s;h pa|negyric to their patron, was that of a &s;lothful and debauched prince, &s;unk in plea&s;ures, and in the mo&s;t contemptible &s;lavery to the clergy. The charter of O&s;wald's law, in which Edgar a&s;&s;erts his having conquered all even to Norway, with a great part of Ireland, is a gro&s;s and notorious in&s;tance of monki&s;h &s;lattery; who, in gratitude for their charters, thus &s;et that weak prince's &s;eal to the mo&s;t ab&s;urd fal&s;ehoods. The Iri&s;h, Scoti&s;h, Northern writers hardly even mark Edgar's ex|i&s;tance as king of England. The <HI>Chronicon Picto|rum</HI> repre&s;ents Kenneth as invading England, in|&s;tead of paying homage. The Annals of Tigher|nach, and of Ul&s;ter, barely mark Edgar's death. The <HI>Orkneying a Saga</HI> knew nothing of him. The power of the Danes had been quite broken before 953, when their kingdom in Northumbria cea&s;ed. Edred and Edwi, predece&s;&s;ors of Edgar, were equally free from Dani&s;h inva&s;ion, &s;o that Edgar's ability is not to be weighed by this circum&s;tance. He was indeed the very fir&s;t monarch of all Eng|land; and it is no wonder that his amity was courted by the other kings in Britain.</P>

<PB N="221" REF="248">renders the re&s;t &s;till more &s;u&s;picious, if it does not &s;tamp them utterly fal&s;e. How is all this? Scotland was always &s;ubdued, always to &s;ubdue; always making homage to England, always mak|ing war on England! always &s;ubject, yet not a trace of it, but &s;ingle &s;entences of Engli&s;h writers, without &s;o much as one permanent fact! Surely human affairs proceed not thus; but if a kingdom be &s;ubject to another, fixt and la&s;ting marks al|ways appear. The forged charters of Harding, and others, concerning Scoti&s;h homage, have been fully expo&s;ed by Rymer and other Engli&s;h antiquaries. But does not the need of &s;uch for|geries prove invincibly that the claim it&s;elf was all one forgery? As for the gifts of Cumberland, and Lothene or pre&s;ent Northumberland, there is room to &s;u&s;pect them as fabulous as the ho|mage; and to que&s;tion if any homage was paid for them till the time of Canute. They &s;eem ac|qui&s;itions by conque&s;t: and examples of &s;uch gifts are not found in the hi&s;tory of any other country.

In the hi&s;tory of Denmark the claim of the Emperor of Germany to the homage of that kingdom oc|curs; and one Dani&s;h king was taken pri&s;oner, and forced to pay it. But Germany being &s;ur|rounded with inferior &s;tates, its writers had many affairs to attend; and do not harp upon this &s;tring always: while poor Scotland was the only country over which Engli&s;h writers could extend their claim. Hence the &s;tyle of old Engli&s;h wri|ters concerning Scotland is quite peculiar, and full of a bitter u&s;urpation, unknown to any other ancient writers, who&s;e works have ever fallen in my way.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER IV.</HI> Origin of the name SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the name <HI>Scotia,</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> origi|nally belonged to Ireland, and continued to belong to that country, alone, till a late period, begins now to be acknowleged even by the fierce&s;t Scoti&s;h writers. This fact clearly appears from the following numerous authorities, while that the names <HI>Scoti, Scotia,</HI> were ever applied to the pre&s;ent Scots and Scotland, before the reign of Malcom II. or beginning of the eleventh cen|tury, not <HI>one</HI> authority can be produced.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t mention of the name <HI>Piks</HI> is by Eumenius the panegyri&s;t, who &s;ays, as fully quoted Part III. ch. I. that, before the time of Julius Cae&s;ar, Britain, that is, the part of Britain fouth of Forth and Clyde, or Roman Britain, was only invaded by the Piks and Iri&s;h, <HI>Pictis modo et Hibernis.</HI> This was written in the year 296; and the name of Scots was &s;till unknown. For as the Britons, before they knew the indigenal ap|pellation of the Piks, termed them Caledonians; &s;o before they knew the indigenal name of that &s;uperior people in Ireland, who&s;e warlike &s;pirit bur&s;t upon them, they called them <HI>Hiberni,</HI> or Iri&s;h, from the name of the iland. So in later times the pirates of Scandinavia were all called Normans, before the indigenal names of Danes, Norwegians, Swedes, came to be known. But the name of Scots is fir&s;t mentioned by Ammia|nus Marcellinus at the year 360, and not as be|longing to mo&s;t ancient times, as Eumenius men|tions that of <HI>Picti;</HI> but as pre&s;ent and immediate

Thus, on the very fir&s;t mention of the name <HI>Scotti,</HI> it is joined with that of <HI>Picti,</HI> ju&s;t as <HI>Hiberni</HI> had been &s;ixty-four years before by Eumenius. This, com+pared with the &s;ub&s;equent authorities, affords a clear inference, that, from the very fir&s;t, <HI>Hiberni</HI> and <HI>Scoti</HI> were &s;ynonymous; that Ireland was <HI>Scotia,</HI> and the Iri&s;h <HI>Scoti.</HI> Indeed it is ri&s;ible to &s;ee &s;ome of our infatuated writers &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch a &s;mall country as Scotland could &s;uffice for two grand nations, the Piks and Scots; while England had but one the Britanni, Gaul but Galli, Spain only Hi&s;pani! Do the&s;e weak men imagine that the noble iland of Ireland, a country &s;uperior in &s;ize, and far more in fertility and popu|lation to Scotland, was quite invi&s;ible to the Ro|mans: or that by another miracle the inhabitants of a country &s;o very near to Britain, never invaded this iland? Do open your eyes, gentlemen! or at lea&s;t do not imagine, that, becau&s;e ye are blind, others mu&s;t be &s;o.

The&s;e facts are clear from all the writers on the War of the Standard, 1138. The <HI>Galweien&s;es vel Picti</HI> reached from Solway to the frith of Clyde. And in Scoti&s;h Lothian from Tweed to Forth was the prime re&s;i|dence of the &s;outhern Piks; whence that country is termed <HI>Pictorum Provincia,</HI> by Beda: and what &s;ome writers on the war of the Standard a&s;cribe to the Piks, the honour of leading the Scoti&s;h army, Brompton gives to the <HI>Lodonen&s;es.</HI> Roger of Che&s;|ter &s;ays, Edinburgh is <HI>in terra Pictorum,</HI> 'in Pik|land;' and the modern name of a range of hills in pre&s;ent Lothian, <HI>Pentland hills,</HI> marks the Piki&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as clearly is Pentland frith or Pictland frith, &s;till &s;o called in the time of James V.

The&s;e people indigenally, and vulgarly, called <HI>Dalriadach,</HI> were al&s;o termed <HI>Scoti Britanniae, Scoti in Britannia,</HI> by &s;uch of their own writers, and others, as u&s;ed Latin; as for in&s;tance Adomnan u&s;es the fir&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ion, Beda the later. Indigenally the Dalriadi al&s;o termed them&s;elves <HI>Gaclach,</HI> as their Iri&s;h an|ce&s;tors did, being a generic name of the Celts. Thus they are &s;pecially termed <HI>Gaedeli</HI> in the <HI>Chronicon Pictorum,</HI> and in the <HI>De&s;criptio Albaniae;</HI> and the old name of <HI>Ard Gael</HI> belongs to their chief &s;ettlement from its mo&s;t ancient date. But by no other names were they known, either among them&s;elves, or by others, in ancient times. The modern name they give them&s;elves, of <HI>Albanach,</HI> anciently belonged to the Piks, as &s;hall pre&s;ently be &s;hewn; and was a&s;&s;umed by the Dalreudini, after their union with the Piks, as the Burgun|dians, &amp;c. &s;ince their coale&s;cence with France are called French; and as the Scots call them&s;elves Britons, &s;ince their union with England.</P>
<P>The Piks, as is clear from the writings of king Alfred, the Saxon Chronicle, Witichind, &amp;c. called them&s;elves <HI>Pihtar, Pehtar, Peohtar</HI> (pro|nounce this la&s;t, as in Icelandic, <HI>Peuhtar</HI>) and in modern language of Scotland, and the north of England, <HI>Pehts;</HI> by later Icelandic writers they are termed <HI>Pets.</HI> The Romans unluckily Latinized this name <HI>Picti.</HI> The Cumraig Britons termed them <HI>Phichtiaid.</HI> The Iri&s;h, who are fond of pa|tronymics, called them, after their fir&s;t king, Cru|then, by the name of <HI>Cruitnich.</HI> Their country they termed <HI>Tir Cruitnich,</HI> The Land of the Cruit|nich, and from the royal re&s;idence <HI>Fortrin,</HI> as the Welch called the king of England king of Lon|don.

<P>But there can be no que&s;tion that <HI>Albani</HI> was an appellation al&s;o belonging to the Piks, and in every
<PB N="233" REF="264">probability indigenal. <HI>Alban</HI> was as would &s;eem the name which the Piks gave to Britain, or at lea&s;t to their part of it; for i can never find it ap|plied to pre&s;ent England, either in ancient or mo|dern times; and they who upon this occa&s;ion dream of the Greek name Albion, &s;hould be re|ferred to Swift's etymologies. Adomnan indeed tran&s;lates <HI>Drum Alban, Dor&s;um Britanniae;</HI> but it is certain that all Iri&s;h and Welch writers confine the name of <HI>Alban</HI> to the north of Britain. At the &s;ame time it is very probable that <HI>Alban</HI> was the name given by the Cumri to Britain, in gene|ral, as <HI>Bret-tan</HI> was by the Belgae; and that the Piks finding their country &s;o called by its fir&s;t in|habitants, retained the appellation. Thus as they were not only Piks, by a peculiar and proper ap|pellation, but al&s;o Britons as inhabitants of Bri|tain, &s;o they were <HI>Albani,</HI> as dwelling in <HI>Alban.</HI> At the &s;ame time we mu&s;t reflect that this name <HI>Albani</HI> is common to highlanders, in many coun|tries peopled by Scythae or Goths; as the Albani on Cauca&s;us, tho&s;e of Macedon, and Italy. This circum&s;tance leads to &s;u&s;pect, that the name is really Gothic<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>Torfaeus Hi&s;t. Norv.

It is po&s;&s;ible al&s;o that the Belgae of Ireland, fronting the mountains of Wales, called Britain <HI>Alban;</HI> and that from them the Greek mariners, coming from the &s;outh, and fir&s;t touching at Ireland, might receive it. However this be, there is no ground whatever to infer that the name of <HI>Albani</HI> was ever, in ancient times, a&s;&s;umed by the Dalreudini, or pre&s;ent Cel|tic highlanders. Adomnan tells us, that <HI>Drum Al|ban,</HI> or <HI>Dor&s;um Britanniae,</HI> as he tran&s;lates it, lay between th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Scots in Britain and the Piks. If
<PB N="234" REF="265"><HI>Alban</HI> be thus tran&s;lated Britain, or if confined to North Britain, it is equally clear that the Dalreu|dini who held &s;o &s;mall a corner, had no claim to the &s;tyle of <HI>Albanach</HI> by eminence. On the con|trary, as that appellation is always found among Gothic nations, there is room to infer that <HI>Alban</HI> and <HI>Albani</HI> were indigenal terms among the Piks, who gave them to their territory, and to them|&s;elves from &s;ituation in it. So the Dalreudini afterward called them&s;elves <HI>Albanach,</HI> from their &s;ituation in Pikland, tho originally <HI>Gael.</HI> There is no room to deny that the Piks might have a peculiar, and al&s;o a territorial appellation, as well as the Dalreudini, Cumri, or other nations in Bri|tain, and in all other countries. The Belgae and Franks were thus <HI>Galli:</HI> the Celtiberi, Suevi, &amp;c. <HI>Hi&s;pani.</HI> Tighernac palpably implies <HI>Albain</HI> to be &s;ynonymous with Pikland; for at 894 he calls Donal king of <HI>Albain,</HI> as he does his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; tho all his predece&s;&s;ors he terms kings of the Piks. The Duan al&s;o puts the Cumri as fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of <HI>Albain,</HI> and then the Piks. It certainly follows from this that the Piks, as inhabitants of <HI>Alban,</HI> were <HI>Albani;</HI> and from Tighernac it is clear that king of the Piks, and king of Albain, were terms as perfectly &s;ynonymous as king of the Scots and king of Scotland. The&s;e matters con&s;idered, it will appear as ridiculous to infer that, becau&s;e our highlanders now term them&s;elves Albanach, they were the ancient Albanach; as to infer that be|cau&s;e the people of Bretagne now call them&s;elves French, they were the original Franci.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments admit of &s;trong reinforcement.

<P>It has been &s;hewn above, from numerous te&s;ti|monies invincible, even by tho&s;e who &s;et all re|gard for truth at defiance, that Ireland was called <HI>Scotia,</HI> and its ruling people Scoti, from the fir&s;t appearance of the&s;e names, down to the eleventh century.

King Alfred, in his paraphra&s;es of Beda, Oro&s;ius, &amp;c. would have noted any change had any occurred &s;ince Beda's time. A&s;&s;er, who wrote his life of Alfred in the beginning of the tenth century, tells us that the Danes, 875, preyed on the Piks and Stratclyde-Welch, from their camp in Northumberland. Not one writer before the eleventh century affords the &s;malle&s;t hint of any change in Pikland. The Saxon Chronicle, written in the eleventh or twelfth century, &s;ometimes calls Ireland <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;ometimes gives North Britain the &s;ame ap|pellation of Scotland; but laterly. In it is pre|&s;erved a poem on the victory of Athel&s;tan over our Con&s;tantin 937, and in every appearance written in&s;tantly after the event; but there is not a trace in that poem of the names <HI>Scot, Scotland,</HI> being applied to North Britain. On the contrary it con&s;tantly gives them to Ireland. Anlaf, or Olave the Red, king of the Scandinavians in Ire|land, and thence called <HI>Scota konungr,</HI> 'king of Scots,' in the Icelandic accounts, was the chief party at the battle of Brunenburg. Both Iri&s;h and Icelandic accounts agree perfectly in this; and it is remarkable that none of the&s;e accounts make the lea&s;t mention of our Con&s;tantin upon this occa&s;ion. He &s;eems merely to have lent his own pre&s;ence; for the Piks, his &s;ubjects, had no &s;kill in &s;ea-affairs; and Olave's fleet was, in every appearance, wholly filled with Scandinavians and Scots of Ireland. The Saxon poem of cour&s;e &s;peaks of <HI>Flottan an Sceotta,</HI> 'the Scotti&s;h mari|ners;' and dwells almo&s;t entirely on the Scots or Iri&s;h, and <HI>Nordmans,</HI> or Scandinavians. Con&s;tan|tin,
<PB N="239" REF="270">it terms <HI>Nord Con&s;tantinus,</HI> 'the Northern Con&s;tantin;' but never calls him Scoti&s;h, or his men Scots. The poem al&s;o &s;ays,

'The Northern men under their &s;hields with &s;pears.'

But this is &s;ubmitted to the reader. Certain it is from this poem, and from the Icelandic accounts, that the name of <HI>Scots</HI> at this period, 937, belonged &s;olely to the Iri&s;h; and they who are the mo&s;t bigotted on the other &s;ide will not in&s;i&s;t that in 846 we Scots were &s;ub|jected to the Norwegians, as Du Che&s;ne's hi&s;to|rian &s;ays; or that in 937 Olave was our king, as the Icelandic writers bear. In the other Icelandic poems, and traditions, relating to events preced|ing the eleventh century, the names <HI>Skota</HI> and <HI>Skotland</HI> generally belong to Ireland. Thus in Ragnar's death-&s;ong <HI>Skotland</HI> is Ireland; and in the Ran&s;om of Egil, Eric, a Dani&s;h king of Northumbria, is called 'Commander of the Scoti&s;h fleet,' becau&s;e he had commanded that of the Scandinavians in Ireland. Saxo Grammati|cus fabulou&s;ly &s;ays Ragnar Lodbrog &s;ubdued <HI>Sco|tia</HI> and <HI>Petia;</HI> that is, Ireland, and Pikland or pre&s;ent Scotland. But there not being an Icelandic or Scandinavian piece extant preceding the ele|venth century, &s;ave a few poems and traditions, it is no wonder that Scotland generally appears in &s;uch late writers, as now accepted; and that many of the&s;e writers confound Ireland with Scot|land.</P>
<P>There being thus not <HI>one</HI> authority for the pre|&s;ent Scots being known by that name, till the
<PB N="240" REF="271">eleventh century, none but mere dreamers and romancers can a&s;&s;ert the contrary, in de&s;pite of plain truth and rea&s;on, and every rule of hi&s;tory. But that the name of Scots was u&s;ed in its pre|&s;ent acceptation in the eleventh century is cer|tain; and they who would make it yet later err on the other &s;ide. Turgot, confe&s;&s;or of queen Margaret, wrote her life in the end of the ele|venth century, and calls her hu&s;band Malcom III king of Scots. The Saxon Chronicle, apparently written under William Rufus, al&s;o accepts Scots as now, toward the end of the work; and applies that name, as u&s;ual, to the people after &s;o called, even before its pre&s;ent application. Macbeth is called <HI>rex Scotorum</HI> in a charter, if genuine<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ruddiman Introd. ad Dipl. Scotiae.</NOTE>. So is indeed a Malcom, but doubtful if the Second, in the charter of Murtlach, who&s;e very exi&s;tence is however dubious. Marianus Scotus, who wrote about 1070 calls Ireland <HI>Scotia;</HI> but at 1034 calls the pre&s;ent Scots, <HI>Scoti.</HI> On the whole the reign of Malcom II. 1001 till 1031, is the proper aera of this new name; and taking the middle of his reign, it appeared about 1016. In 1150 Ireland and Scotland were known by their pre&s;ent names even in Egypt<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Geogr. Nub. Climat. 7. part. 2.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion mu&s;t be an&s;wered in the ne|gative; for the Scots of the eleventh century were as different a people from tho&s;e of Adomnan

The old Scots u&s;ed the Celtic tongue, and came from Ireland to Dal|riada or Argyle. The later Scots u&s;ed the Gothic tongue, and came from Scandinavia, being the very &s;ame people before called Piks. There was certainly no revolution in North Britain in the time of Malcom II. and yet the name fir&s;t appears then. The name was at fir&s;t confined to the mid|dle of the ea&s;tern part of Scotland, as above &s;hewn: and as it &s;pred over the re&s;t without revolution, &s;o it is certain it began without revolution. Had it proceeded from Kenneth's bearing the Piki&s;h &s;ceptre, it would have begun then: but, on the contrary, he, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, are called kings of the Piks; then kings of Albany, 894; then kings of the Scots, 1016. Giraldus, or whoever wrote the <HI>De&s;criptio Albanioe,</HI> had his information from Andrew bi&s;hop of Caithne&s;s, and was cer|tainly well informed as to it's then &s;tate, 1180. He tells us Albany was called Scotia, CORRUPTE, 'corruptly.' Had the old Scots vanqui&s;hed the Piks, as fabled, the name was proper, not cor|rupt. The &s;ame writer affords clear evidence that the old Scots of Beda did not impart their name to the later Scots; but had on the contrary lo&s;t their own, and were not regarded as Scots, when the later name began. For he &s;ays, <HI>Montes qui dividunt Scociam ab Arregaithel,</HI> 'the moun|tains which divide Scotland from Argyle:' and he tells us the people of Argyle were <HI>Hybernen&s;es,</HI> whereas he gives no hint that the later <HI>Scotti</HI> were &s;o: but, on the contrary, his &s;pecial mention that the people of Argyle were <HI>Hibernen&s;es,</HI> or Iri&s;h, &s;ufficiently implies that the later Scoti were not, any more than the Moravien&s;es, Lodonen&s;es, Gal|weien&s;es, who were all afterward called Scots.

<PB N="242" REF="275">from the <HI>Scoti,</HI> the name there given to the ea&s;tern people or Piks. This &s;hews the radical mi&s;take of our fabuli&s;ts, who confound the old Scoti with the later; as Olahus, and other Hun|garian fabuli&s;ts, take the Huns for the Hungarians. Moreover the old Engli&s;h writers on the war of the &s;tandard, 1138, mention the <HI>Scoti</HI> along with the Galweien&s;es, Lodonen&s;es, &amp;c. The&s;e Scots were certainly not Highlanders, a people always de&s;pi&s;ed as mere &s;avages by our monarchs; but the people from Forth to Moray, as Sir David Dalrymple ob&s;erves in his Annals. Their offen&s;ive arms were &s;pears, the known weapons of the Low|land Scots, in later times. The Highlanders are called <HI>Hibernen&s;es,</HI> 1180; and &s;o Barbour, 1375, calls them <HI>Eri&s;chry,</HI> 'Iri&s;h;' and our other writers to this day term their language <HI>Er&s;e,</HI> or Iri&s;h. Even in 1180, or the century after the fir&s;t ap|pearance of the later name of Scots, the High|landers, or old Scots of Beda, are &s;pecially di&s;tin|gui&s;hed as a different people from the later Scots; &s;o that it is clear that the later Scots were not &s;o called, becau&s;e the &s;ame identic people with the old Scots of Britain, or even incorporated with them; &s;eeing that the old Scots actually were not called Scots when this name was fir&s;t given to the later Scots, but, on the contrary, were termed Iri&s;h, as a &s;ufficient di&s;tinction from the later Scots, who were not Iri&s;h. This plain account may occa&s;ion a &s;mile at the Scoti&s;h and Iri&s;h antiqui&s;ts, who have fought &s;o long about what none of them under&s;tood: for as the Scots of Ireland did not proceed from Britain, &s;o the pre&s;ent Scots did not come from Ireland.

<P>The &s;econd que&s;tion is of cour&s;e an&s;wered in the affirmative, namely, that the later, and pre&s;ent Scots, are quite a different people from the <HI>Scoti Britanniae</HI> of Adomnan and Beda: and their name proceeded not from any conque&s;t, or coale&s;cence with the old <HI>Scoti,</HI> but from &s;ome other cau&s;e. This cau&s;e in fact marked them not as the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> but as a <HI>different</HI> people, as above &s;hewn. The name began in North Britain, on the ea&s;t, between Forth and Moray; while the old Scots of Argyle were regarded as <HI>Hibernen&s;es</HI> not as <HI>Scoti.</HI> And the country, where the name fir&s;t began, had been ever regarded as the prime &s;eat of the Piks, who continued its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors as the names, and lan|guage, and people of that tract, always were, and are, Gothic. But how came this new name of Scots to be given to a central part of the Piks, around the king's re&s;idence? It is an&s;wered, ju&s;t as the name of Scots originally aro&s;e in Ireland. The whole little learning of Pikland lay among the Iri&s;h clergy; for Ireland, as it &s;upplied Eng|land, and even France, with many clergy, &s;o it &s;upplied almo&s;t all the clergy of Pikland. Hyona was indeed the &s;upreme cathedral of Pikland, as Beda tells, and all know: and Hyona was fur|ni&s;hed with abbots, &amp;c. from Ireland. The Piks, a northern Gothic nation, de&s;pi&s;ed holine&s;s, and the learning then in vogue, as long as their ance&s;tors of Scandinavia; and there is not one Piki&s;h &s;aint or writer on record. This clearly evidences that their clergy, or only literati, mu&s;t have been Iri&s;h. And there is every rea&s;on to be|lieve that the name <HI>Scoti</HI> was given them by their Iri&s;h clergy, for one of the&s;e two rea&s;ons, or both. 1. The Dalreudini, tho originally mixt with Goths, yet from intermarriages in Ireland,
<PB N="244" REF="277">and con&s;tant intercour&s;e with that kingdom, be|came almo&s;t quite Celtic; or at lea&s;t certainly u&s;ed the Celtic tongue from the beginning. In that tongue the Scythians or Goths were called Scots, as fully explained above; and as the Celts call them&s;elves by generic names, &s;o they natu|rally gave a generic name to the Piks, who were Scythians or Scots. And thus, as the wild Iri&s;h were at fir&s;t termed <HI>Hibernen&s;es,</HI> and their Gothic conquerors <HI>Scoti,</HI> &s;o the wild Highlanders, and their Gothic neighbours, fell into the very &s;ame di&s;tinctions of <HI>Hibernen&s;es</HI> and <HI>Scoti.</HI> 2. But it &s;eems more probable that the Iri&s;h church|men did not receive this novelty from the vulgar, but gave ri&s;e to it them&s;elves. For di&s;covering from Beda, and others, that the Piks were Scy|thae, and from Nennius, and Iri&s;h chronicles, that the name Scythae was &s;ynonymous with Scoti, they would naturally give their favorite term to the Piks, as real Scythae or Scoti. Other cau&s;es might concur. <HI>Picti</HI> was but an odd name for a people; and the practice of &s;taining the body was con&s;idered as Pagan, and the very memory of it to be aboli&s;hed. The real word from which this was latinized, <HI>Pihtar,</HI> or <HI>Pehtar,</HI> never oc|curred as &s;uch; but the &s;econd meaning <HI>painted</HI> was odious in every view <HI>Pehts</HI> was a har&s;h word to latinize; tho, had Witichind fallen in the way of the&s;e people, perhaps REX PEHI|TORUM might have remained, to the la&s;ting clearne&s;s of our hi&s;tory. But <HI>Albani</HI> was lyable to none of the&s;e objections; yet having never been u&s;ed by Roman writers, as applicable to the Scots, it ob|tained no notice Per&s;onal vanity might al&s;o in|duce the Iri&s;h clergy to give their beloved name <HI>Scoti</HI> to their Piki&s;h laity. But it was certainly the very wor&s;t name that could have been given, as it belonged to a neighbouring country; and the confu&s;ion it has introduced into our hi&s;|tory is eternal and irremediable. The new Scots
<PB N="245" REF="278">were however more properly &s;o, than the old, as they pre&s;erved their Scythic or Gothic lan|guage: and the name was &s;o far curious as in Ire|land, and Scotland, it formed an extreme we&s;tern bound for the Scythic &s;ettlements in Europe, as Ancient Scythia on the Euxine did the extreme ea&s;tern bound of the&s;e &s;ettlements. That the name of Scots was given to the Piks, becau&s;e it was ob&s;erved that the later were really Scythae, as the former were originally, is not merely a plau|&s;ible conjecture, but actually re&s;ts upon an ancient and valuable monument of our hi&s;tory. For the <HI>Chronicon Regum Pictorum,</HI> who&s;e perfect concord|ance with all the be&s;t, and mo&s;t ancient, Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h writers, renders it the mo&s;t valuable of all our hi&s;toric fragments, as fully &s;hewn before, has a preface &s;hewing the identity of the Piks, Scythae, Scoti. This Chronicle is certainly one of our mo&s;t ancient monuments, and written in or before the eleventh century; for, after that time, the new name <HI>Scoti</HI> had &s;uch a pernicious effect, that the hi&s;tory of the Piks became a &s;acrifice to that of the old <HI>Scoti,</HI> who had no concern with the new <HI>Scoti.</HI> The preface to it &s;eems fully to evidence the rea&s;ons that led to change the name of <HI>Picti</HI> for <HI>Scoti.</HI> It tells that the <HI>Picti</HI> were &s;o called from &s;taining their bodies; in which, as in other points, it gives the very words of I&s;idorus, who&s;e etymologies are &s;o ri&s;ible. The author never reflected that <HI>Pihtar,</HI> the vulgar name for the Piks, could only be latinized <HI>Picti,</HI> and that the meaning of the later word was foreign to the que&s;tion: and that I&s;idorus never heard of the in|digenal name, but gave at random an etymology, indeed plau&s;ible if compared with his others, for his work in this view is a perpetual fund of laughter. The preface then &s;ays the <HI>Scoti</HI> are &s;o called "qua&s;i Sciti, quia a Scythia regione vene|runt." Then the arrival of the Britons is noted, in the words of Nennius, as is that of the Scots or
<PB N="246" REF="279">Scythae in Ireland. It is added, <HI>Gentes Scitiae albo crine na&s;cuntur, ab a&s;&s;iduis nivibus; et ip&s;ius capilli color genti nomen dedit, et inde dicuntur Al|bani; de quibus originem duxerunt Scotti et Picti.</HI> 'The nations of Scythia are born with white hair, becau&s;e of the perpetual &s;now; and the colour of their hair gave the name of Albani (White) to the nation, from which the Scots and Piks drew their origin.' This curious pa&s;&s;age &s;hews that the Piks were called <HI>Albani;</HI> and that they and the Scots were reputed of common origin as Scythae. The Chronicle then remarks on the A&s;iatic Albani, and the Gothi, Gethae, or Scythae, and Daci, and gives a long account of Ancient Scythia on the Euxine, chiefly in the words of I&s;i|dorus. This preface is very curious, as it &s;hews the then &s;tate of learning in Pikland. I&s;idorus was the favorite author there, as in Ireland, where the etymology of <HI>Ibernia</HI> from <HI>Iberia</HI> was fir&s;t di&s;covered from him; and all the Mile&s;ian fables built upon that ba&s;is. Perhaps the perver|&s;ion both of Iri&s;h, and of Scoti&s;h, ancient hi&s;tory &s;prings &s;olely from one fooli&s;h book, the <HI>Origines</HI> of I&s;idorus. Such are human affairs! I &s;u&s;pect that I&s;idorus is the &s;ole father of the new name of Scoti given to the Piks; and that the following &s;en|tence ruined the hi&s;tory of Pikland; <HI>Scoti propria lingua nomen habent a picto corpore, eo quod aculeis ferreis cum atramento variarum figurarum &s;tigmate an|notantur.</HI> Orig. lib.

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER V.</HI> Manners and Antiquities of this Period from <HI>843</HI> till <HI>1056.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHAT is &s;aid in the former volume, con|cerning the manners and antiquities of the Piks, may be al&s;o generally referred to this period. The manners even of the Lowlanders continued very barbarous, as might be expected among a people &s;hut up, in a corner of a remote iland, from the advantages of intercour&s;e with &s;outhern and civilized nations. The meek tem|per of Chri&s;tianity, while it perhaps too much emolliated the manners of &s;outhern nations, had the mo&s;t beneficial effects upon the ferocity of the northern. But nothing can more &s;trongly mark the poverty of Scotland, than the fewne&s;s of her epi&s;copal &s;ees, and great churches, pre|ceding the reign of David I. 1124. Abernethy, Dunkeld, and St. Andrews, were founded before 843, as formerly narrated; and it &s;eems remark|able that we find no valid authority for any other religious foundation preceding the year 1056<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Chron. Pict. mentions that Kenneth IV. gave Bre|chen to the church. Does this imply that a church was founded there, or that he gave it to a church already founded, as Dunkeld, &amp;c.?</NOTE>. Had any &s;uch taken place, our old li&s;ts could never have been totally &s;ilent on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The manners of the North Britons, at this pe|riod, can only be &s;tudied in tho&s;e of the Scandi|navians, to be found in different Icelandic au|thors; and which we may &s;afely regard as pa|rallel to tho&s;e of their brethren in Pikland. But
<PB N="248" REF="281">&s;o much has been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject in the former volume, that i &s;hall not enlarge upon it here, but &s;hall content my&s;elf with adding a few remarks upon &s;uch ancient monuments in Scot|land, as &s;eem peculiar to this period.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e the buildings vulgarly called Piks Hou&s;es form a remarkable in&s;tance. They are of a conic form, and of two kinds. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> the &s;mall, which con&s;i&s;t of a hall, or large apartment in the middle, with places for beds on the &s;ides, as u&s;ual among the Icelanders and other Goths<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Gunlang's Saga, and the plates in it.</NOTE>. At about the height of twelve feet the wall converges into a conic arch, with a hole in the center, to emit the &s;moke. <HI>Secondly,</HI> the large, which have walls thirty or forty feet high as yet remaining, but converge not to a point at the top, tho parts of the wall &s;eem &s;till of the original height.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t are infallibly the mo&s;t ancient, and are now only found in the northern extremities of Scotland, where there was no temptation to u&s;e their &s;tones for fences, or other civilized purpo&s;es. A good de&s;cription and print of &s;uch may be found in Mr. Pennant's third volume. The walls are of prodigious thickne&s;s, piled with dry &s;tones, but with con&s;iderable art. I am almo&s;t tempted to think that Arthur's Oven, a Roman work, fur|ni&s;hed our rude ance&s;tors with a hint for &s;uch buildings, being a &s;imilar fabric with a hole in the roof, but of far &s;uperior art and neatne&s;s. The&s;e ca&s;tles, tho rude and &s;mall, were certainly only u&s;ed by the chiefs, or the rich, while the common people had wooden or turf huts. They, as well as the next, are &s;eldom found on hills; but are generally in glens, and by the &s;ides of waters.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, or large ca&s;tles, are of a con&s;truc|tion quite &s;ingular. The walls, as they yet re|main, are often from thirty to forty feet high;
<PB N="249" REF="282">and the central area of as great diameter. There are two walls; the inner of which ri&s;es erect; the outer, generally at the bottom four or five feet di&s;tant from the other, gradually verges inward, till it joins. The outer wall has no windows, or holes at all, except a &s;mall door. The inner has windows, &s;ometimes large, with &s;tone &s;helves running acro&s;s, &s;ometimes very &s;mall. Between the walls is a rude &s;tairca&s;e, running to the top; and two or three galleries five or &s;ix feet high pa&s;s above each other all around, between the walls, except where interrupted by the rude &s;tair|ca&s;e. The middle &s;pace formed one great round hall, open at the top; and there is no mark of any floors; as indeed, even in later times, halls were often thirty to forty feet high<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See Gordon's Itin. Sept. Pennant's Tour. Archaeologia, vols. V. VI. Cordiner's Antiquities.</NOTE>. The&s;e large ca&s;tles are more common than the &s;mall, and are even numerous in the north of Scotland, and in the Hebudes and Orkneys. Particularly in the vale of Glenelg, near Bernera, on the we&s;t of Inverne&s;s-&s;hire, there are no le&s;s than four. Dun Dornadilla is a remarkable one in that mo&s;t unknown corner of Scotland, the North We&s;t ex|tremity, around the Cape called <HI>Hvarf</HI> by the Norwegians, and now corruptly <HI>Wrath.</HI> It &s;eems to have received its name from a female po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Dornagilla, a common female name.</NOTE>; as for king Dornadilla, he is a non-exi&s;tence, and of the family of Gargantua. Perhaps indeed the par&s;on of the pari&s;h, after Boyce's fables ap|peared, told the people that this mu&s;t have been a re&s;idence of Dornadilla the great hunter; and they pre&s;erve this information by pious tradition. But it is fooli&s;h to rea&s;on upon traditional names, or any thing belonging to tradition; el&s;e we might conclude Arthur's Oven to be ju&s;tly &s;o called.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="283">Mr. King regards the&s;e edifices as the rudi|mental forms of Gothic ca&s;tles. They evidently belong to this period of our hi&s;tory; and were followed by the &s;quare tower, &s;uch as the ca&s;tle of Oldwick. The Norman lords, who acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Scotland, in the twelfth and thir|teenth centuries, mu&s;t have introduced the com|plete Norman ca&s;tle. In the North of Scotland, and the Orkneys, the&s;e conic edifices are called Piks Hou&s;es. In the Hebudes the &s;ame kind of forts, in all re&s;pects, are called Dani&s;h; and in Scotland the vulgar a&s;cribe many antiquities to the <HI>Pehts,</HI> in which they had no &s;hare. Nothing can indeed be founded on tradition, which is al|ways uncertain, if not always fal&s;e; and it is even beneath a &s;evere writer once to mention it. There is one circum&s;tance, which &s;trongly indi|cates the&s;e forts Norwegian; namely, that they extend over the Orkneys, Hebudes, Caithne&s;s, Sutherland, and Ro&s;s, and are found in no other part of Scotland. That is, they are found ex|actly in tho&s;e very parts which were held by the Norwegians. A local invention might take place among the Norwegians in Scotland; and not ex|tend to their other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But, at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be reflected, that not many of the&s;e forts exi&s;t even in the north of Scotland, excluding the Orkneys and Hebudes. And if any are found in the ea&s;t and &s;outh, where the Grampians, and other hills, afford glens enough for their erection and pre&s;ervation, the claim of the Piks mu&s;t come in. In the Appendix to Mr. Pennant's third volume, p. 453, is mention of the founda|tions of &s;everal &s;uch circular buildings exi&s;ting in one &s;pot near Perth. But certainly &s;ome mu&s;t be found as entire in the ea&s;t and &s;outh as in the north, if really Piki&s;h works. As the ca&s;e &s;tands i mu&s;t &s;ay that they appear to me Norwegian, upon the model of the &s;maller &s;ort, which

<P>Much has been lately &s;aid, and written, concerning &s;ome vitrified forts di&s;covered in Scotland. Some believed that O&s;&s;ian was the builder; and &s;ome that the infernal monarch had baked them with his own fire. At length a letter ap|peared in the Edin. Mag. Sept. 1787, written, as i am in|formed, by George Demp&s;ter, E&s;q. who&s;e name implies every prai&s;e of a patriot and a man, which di&s;covered that the&s;e vi|trified forts belong to the thirteenth century. The authority is Sir Robert Gordon, of Gordon &s;town, in his hi&s;tory of the Sutherland Family, folio MS. p. 5. of the Geographical De|&s;cription of Sutherland: "Dun Creigh was built with a &s;trange kynd of morter, by one Paull Macktyre. This I doe take to be a kynd of ore; how&s;oever this is mo&s;t certaine that ther hath not been &s;een ane harder kynd of morter." Again, p. 19, of the Genealogie of the Earls of Sutherland: "Paull Macktyre was a man of great power and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions" (between 1275 and 1297, as appears from dates in&s;erted). "In his time he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the lands of Creigh in Sutherland; and built a hou&s;e called Down Creigh, with &s;uch a kynd of hard mort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, that at this day it cannot be known wherof it was maid. As he was building this hou&s;e and fortre&s;&s;e, he had intelligence that his onlie &s;on was &s;lain in Catteynes, in company with one Murthow Rea, ane outlaw, and valiant captane, in the&s;e dayes; which made him de&s;i&s;t from further building, when he had almo&s;t fini&s;hed the &s;ame. There are many things fabulouslie reported of this Paull Macktyre. amoug&s;t the vulgure people, which I doe omit to relate." Sir Rob. Sibbald's MSS, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> d. Lib. have in his <HI>Vera Suther|landiae De&s;criptio,</HI> "Varia &s;unt hic ca&s;tella....Down Crigh a quodam Paulo Mactiro extructum &s;uit."</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>A great &s;ingularity attending the&s;e edifices is, that in Glenelg, on the we&s;tern extremity of In|verne&s;s-&s;hire, oppo&s;ite to the He of Skey, were no le&s;s than four of them, within the extent of one mile. If we &s;uppo&s;e them forts of defence garri|&s;oned again&s;t an enemy, or re&s;idences of chiefs, this proximity is alike puzzling; and contrary to the practice of all ages and countries. If garri|&s;ons, they could neither have been placed &s;o
<PB N="252" REF="285">near, nor have &s;tood in glens, the very wor&s;t &s;itu|ation. Antiquaries and commentators generally pa&s;s over difficult pa&s;&s;ages, without even a hint; and it is therefore no wonder that no writer on the &s;ubject has attempted to explain this. But from the proximity, and &s;heltered &s;ituation of &s;ome of the&s;e edifices, &s;uch would appear winter retreats of the richer cla&s;s of inhabitants, with their retainers. For we are not to &s;uppo&s;e that among the Piks, or Norwegians, Gothic nations, not &s;plit into breeds or clans, the ca&s;e was the &s;ame as among the Celts, who&s;e chiefs were kings, and the clan beggars and &s;laves, without property or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Among the ancient Ger|mans arable land belonged to the tribe, and not to individuals, as we learn from Tacitus. And pa&s;ture-ground, as the Highlands of Scotland, mu&s;t have been common to the &s;ociety of the di&s;trict; but individuals were wealthy in propor|tion to their herds and flocks. That unique work <HI>I&s;lands Landnamabok,</HI> or The Book of Icel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndic Origins, being the only one containing a full and minute di&s;play of the &s;ettlement of a barbaric colony, throws great light on the &s;tate of property among the Norwegians, in the ninth century. Individuals had numerous flocks of &s;heep and of &s;wine, wandering on the mountains, while their few hor&s;es and cattle were carefully kept near home, and &s;hut up at night in turf &s;ta|bles adjoining to the hou&s;e. Many were rich in this primitive wealth; and the poor were free and indu&s;trious, and had their voice in the national council, when the wealthy did not forget that they were men. The rich pretended not to be tyrants, but lived in concord and &s;ubjection to the laws. It al&s;o appears from that work, that the numerous &s;toremen, or rich, had &s;ummer re&s;i|dences<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sumer &s;egea,</HI> p. 126, 131, &amp;c.</NOTE>, and winter re&s;idences: the former on
<PB N="253" REF="286">the hills; the later in &s;heltered glens, and &s;ome|times &s;o near each other, as to form little towns. Friend&s;hip, family connections, and mutual de|fence and intercour&s;e, naturally occa&s;ioned &s;uch in&s;tances. The mountainous lands being free pa&s;ture, there was no room for an e&s;tate with a ca&s;tle, as in later times of fixt and hereditary pro|perty. When the &s;tate of &s;ociety therefore is con&s;idered, the propinquity of the&s;e ca&s;tles will not be matter of &s;urprize: and it is ob&s;ervable that they are called <HI>Duns</HI> in the Highlands, the Gothic word for a <HI>Town,</HI> the later being a &s;light alteration of it, as in the Gothic D and T are of|ten interchanged. In Scotland a farm-hou&s;e with out-hou&s;es, or two or three &s;tanding near each other, are called <HI>towns</HI> by the common people to this day.</P>

Ca&s;tle Troddan, Glenelg, has a ruin|ous building fronting the door, and opening to|ward it, &s;urely for flocks or herds; for the door of the large ones is &s;o &s;mall, that a hor&s;e or cow could not enter; &s;o that adjacent receptacles were nece&s;&s;ary for them. This &s;mallne&s;s of the door is an u&s;ual practice among barbaric nations; per|haps meant for more warmth and &s;ecurity; or perhaps merely an erroneous cu&s;tom, for in mo&s;t arts the be&s;t plan, tho quite obvious, is &s;eldom lighted on at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e buildings are intere&s;ting as &s;pecimens of the mo&s;t ancient Gothic ca&s;tles. Mr. King has con&s;idered them in this view; and ob&s;erves that Conin&s;burg ca&s;tle, York&s;hire, the olde&s;t in Eng|land, is a mere improvement of a Piki&s;h <HI>dun.</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="287">But as York&s;hire was in antient Northumbria, the great &s;eat of the Danes, i take Conin&s;burg to be Dani&s;h, and not Saxon, as Mr. King infers.</P>
<P>Another cla&s;s of monuments, &s;ome of which are perhaps as ancient as this period from 843 till 1056, are the engraven obeli&s;ques. Saxo tells us, that Regnar Lodbrog, about 840, erected &s;uch &s;tones in honour of his victories<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P>Regnerus &s;axis rerum ge&s;tarum apices prae &s;e &s;erentibus, hi&s;demque &s;uper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e locatis, aeternum victoriae &s;uae monumen|tum affixit.

During the di&s;a&s;trous reign of Con&s;tantin II. 864 &mdash;882, the Danes indeed ravaged in the very vi|tals of Pikland. In 867 Olave wa&s;ted Pikland from New Year's Day till 17th March. About 878 the Danes remained a whole year in Pik|land. The&s;e events are pre&s;erved in the <HI>Chron. Pictorum,</HI> one of the mo&s;t valuable records of our genuine hi&s;tory. But the&s;e invaders came merely for &s;poil, as appears from Tighernac; and it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that they would be at the trouble and expence of erecting &s;uch artificial mo|numents of their rapine. In England, and e&s;pe|cially in Northumberland, the&s;e &s;poilers remained fixt, and yet have left no &s;uch monuments. I therefore conclude with Mr. Pennant, that the&s;e remains belong to the Piks, the inhabitants of the country. But when Mr. Pennant &s;ays, III. 168, that no &s;uch &s;tones are found in Scandinavia, without Runic in&s;criptions, he goes too far; for in the edition of Saxo by Stephanius, p. 173, three &s;tones, Nos. 4, 5, 6, are &s;imilar to the Piki&s;h, and without in&s;criptions: not to name
<PB N="255" REF="288">other in&s;tances, tho the Northern antiquaries have &s;eldom thought tho&s;e without in&s;criptions worth publi&s;hing. And indeed the want of letters among the Piks cannot be enough regretted on every occa&s;ion of their hi&s;tory. It mu&s;t al&s;o be added, that if the&s;e &s;tones had been memorials of enemies, the inhabitants would have eagerly de|&s;troyed &s;uch trophies of their &s;hame.</P>
<P>In Scandinavia &s;uch &s;tones are found of as late erection as the fifteenth century; which is evi|denced by their dates, and there is room to infer that tho&s;e in Scotland are far later than is gene|rally imagined. Upon looking into Mr. Cordi|ner's Antiquities, it will be found that the figures on the&s;e obeli&s;ques are of the &s;ame &s;tyle and kind with tho&s;e on &s;ome tomb-&s;tone, which he produces, remaining in and near churches known to have been founded in the twelfth century; and which tomb-&s;tones have, like the obeli&s;ques, no in&s;crip|tions. The obeli&s;que near Forres is the mo&s;t re|markable, and has been publi&s;hed by Mr. Cor|diner with laudable care. Perhaps it was erected by Malcom IV. upon his victories over the Mo|ravians. The common Scoti&s;h dre&s;s appears, from it, to have been a tunic with &s;kirts, girded round the wai&s;t. Trou&s;ers or breeches were a luxury among the barbaric Goths, and only u&s;ed by the chiefs; and it appears, from Mr. Strutt's plates, that even among the common people in England, breeches were not u&s;ed till after the ele|venth century. The dre&s;s of the common Saxons is quite the &s;ame with that of the Scots on the obeli&s;ques at Forres. The want of in&s;crip|tions on tho&s;e monuments is one proof, among many, of the &s;low progre&s;s of letters in Scotland.</P>
<P>As national councils and courts of ju&s;tice were held in the open air till late times, there is room to infer that &s;ome of the &s;tone circles, fooli&s;hly called Druidic temples, belong to this period.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Hi&s;tory.</HEAD>
<P>THE grand intention of this work may be regarded as already fulfilled, in the forgoing pages; which, it is hoped, place our ancient hi&s;|tory upon the perpetual ba&s;is of ancient authori|ties, or, in other words, of hi&s;toric truth. What &s;hall be here added in this la&s;t Part, and in the Supplement, is rather illu&s;trative, than e&s;&s;ential; and &s;hall therefore be more briefly treated, than tho&s;e radical points, upon which the very exi&s;t|ence of our hi&s;tory depends.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="291">In this chapter on our ancient Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Hi&s;|tory, it is only propo&s;ed, in the fir&s;t place, to offer a few remarks on the conver&s;ion of the people of North Britain to chri&s;tianity; and la&s;tly, to hint at the few events, which can be recovered, in chronologic order.</P>
<P>Baronius expre&s;&s;es great wonder that the con|ver&s;ion of the Scots in Britain &s;hould be totally omitted by Beda, and by other ancient writers. But when the &s;imple light of truth is di&s;covered, it throws uniform &s;plendor all around it; and to him who has attended to the forgoing pages, this wonder will totally cea&s;e. Beda's Scots in Britain were but the inhabitants of Argyle, a petty di&s;|trict, and were converted to chri&s;tianity during their exile in Ireland, from 446 till 503. Their conver&s;ion was beneath notice. That of the inha|bitants of North Britain, the Piks, after 1016 called Scots, is &s;ufficiently illu&s;trated by Beda, as its importance required.</P>
<P>But our ignorant dreamers, in a paroxy&s;m of &s;elf-love for the Scoti&s;h name, and confounding Beda's Scots in Britain with quite a different people, the later and pre&s;ent Scots, contend that Palladius was &s;ent to the Scots in Britain, as Pa|trick was to the Iri&s;h. I que&s;tion if the very ex|i&s;tence of the Scots in Britain, that great people in Argyle, was in the lea&s;t known to the Pope who &s;ent Palladius. The Scots of Ireland, &s;ince the here&s;y of Pelagius, had been well known, and attracted particular attention: but the occa&s;ion re|quires a few hints on the conver&s;ion of the Iri&s;h.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity had made &s;ome progre&s;s in Ireland, before the mi&s;&s;ion of Palladius and Patrick, 430 and 432. Nothing can evince this more clearly than the here&s;y of Pelagius, which as U&s;her &s;hews, from collation of the be&s;t authorities, broke out in 405. Tho Pelagius was a Briton, yet his apo&s;tle Cele&s;tius, condemned in the Synod of Carthage 412, was a <HI>Scotus,</HI> or Iri&s;hman. Hence St. Je|rome,
<PB N="261" REF="292">who lived at this time, calls the here&s;y of Pelagius <HI>pullis Scotorum,</HI> 'Scoti&s;h potage;' and rails at it as peculiarly Scoti&s;h, that is Iri&s;h. Some Coun&s;els al&s;o admoni&s;h again&s;t the <HI>pultis Scotorum.</HI> The reader has &s;een above, from the con&s;ent of all antiquity, that the name <HI>Scoti</HI> belonged to the Iri&s;h alone, till the eleventh century; at which time, by a caprice of chance, it pa&s;&s;ed to the Piks or pre&s;ent Scots. That Cele&s;tius was an Iri&s;hman follows of cour&s;e; and he became &s;o illu&s;trious a propagator of this here&s;y that, as Augu&s;tin in|forms, it's followers were in his time called Cele&s;|tians, not Pelagians. The <HI>pultis Scotorum,</HI> and &s;imilar expre&s;&s;ions, indicate that this here&s;y was not confined to one <HI>Scotus,</HI> Cele&s;tius; but that he had many followers of his own country. At any rate it would be ab&s;urd to think that Cele&s;tius was the only <HI>Scotus,</HI> who was a chri&s;tian; and it is on the contrary fair to conclude that, by means of intercour&s;e with Britain, chri&s;tianity had made &s;ome progre&s;s in Ireland, in the fourth century. But as Gildas te&s;tifies that even in his time the Britons were much addicted to pagani&s;m, &s;uch &s;eems to have been the ca&s;e in Ireland, down to St. Patrick's time at lea&s;t. And chri&s;tianity was not received by the kings, till St. Patrick's time, &s;o that it was liable to total expul&s;ion, till in his hands it became regal and univer&s;al. He is there|fore de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed the apo&s;tle of Ireland.</P>
<P>The Pelagian or Cele&s;tian here&s;y had excited great ferment in chri&s;tendom; and it is no wonder that it drew much attention of the bi&s;hop of Rome, now a&s;piring to pre-eminent power, toward the <HI>Scoti</HI> or Iri&s;h, after who&s;e name it was &s;pecially called. Accordingly Pope Cele&s;tinus in 429 &s;ent Germanus, a Gallic bi&s;hop, to purge Britain of this here&s;y; and in the &s;ame, or next, year &s;ent Palladius, a deacon of the Roman church, to Ire|land, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; appointing him bi&s;hop of all the <HI>Scoti,</HI> or Iri&s;h, who believed in Chri&s;t.
<PB N="262" REF="293">Germanus, having performed his commi&s;&s;ion, re|turned to his own &s;ee of Autun in Burgundy. Palladius, after remaining a &s;hort time in Ireland, left it; and died in Britain on his return to Rome. If we believe old authors of the life of St. Patrick, Palladius died in Pikland. Others &s;ay he was martyred in Ireland: others that he died in the territory of the Britons. The fir&s;t account, name|ly, that he died in Pikland, is the mo&s;t &s;ingular; but it &s;eems likely that he pa&s;&s;ed over to Britain, from the north of Ireland, and died in Galloway, held by Piks after 426, as above &s;hewn. But the place and manner of his death is &s;o uncertain, that nothing can be built on it. From Pro&s;per we know that he was &s;ent <HI>ad Scotos;</HI> and that this name belonged &s;olely to the Iri&s;h till 1016, the reader has &s;een above. As for the Scots of Argyle they were certainly of importance, and de&s;erve to u&s;urp the hi&s;tory of Ireland! yet can nothing be more ri&s;ible, than the conduct of &s;ome of our an|tiqui&s;ts on this occa&s;ion. They contend that the ancient church in Scotland was not &s;ubject to Roman bi&s;hops, yet contend that Palladius was &s;ent to them! But national phrenzy is capable of any ab&s;urdity. It &s;uffices to ob&s;erve on this &s;ub|ject, that Palladius is quite unknown to the old and genuine monuments of our hi&s;tory. Ninian, Columba, and, in later times, St. Andrew, are the only &s;aintly patrons of our accounts. Not a church was ever dedicated to Palladius in Scot|land; nor is there a trace of him in our hi&s;tory, or tradition: whereas Tighernac who wrote in 1088, and old writers of St. Patrick's life, with other Iri&s;h, Briti&s;h, and Engli&s;h old documents, fix his mi&s;&s;ion to Ireland; where his name was ever revered, and con&s;ecrated by churches, and popular tradition.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem that Palladius, educated in the &s;plendor of the Roman por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ificate, found Ireland
<PB N="263" REF="294">in &s;uch a &s;tate of barbari&s;m, that he left it in order to acquaint the pope with its almo&s;t pagan condi|tion, and to procure a&s;&s;i&s;ting mi&s;&s;ionaries. How|ever this be, after his death, Patrick, a native of Stratclyde, was &s;ent to Ireland in 432, where he met with great &s;ucce&s;s. That Patrick &s;ucceeded Palladius in his function, the re&s;timonies of an|cient writers are numerous; and none of us has yet imagined that Patrick was &s;ent to pre&s;ent Scot|land: &s;o that the dreams of our antiqui&s;ts on this, as on other &s;ubjects, not only &s;hew an ignorance gro&s;s beyond example, but are al&s;o &s;o irrational as to defy rea&s;on, while they defy truth.</P>
<P>Another late dream of our antiqui&s;ts is, that Scotland was converted by ea&s;tern mi&s;&s;ionaries! The cau&s;e of this profound idea is that tho&s;e &s;criblers, who pretend to treat our antiquities, are &s;o gro&s;&s;ly ignorant even in this the eighteenth century, as to confound the di&s;putes between the church of Rome and tho&s;e of Ireland and Scot|land, concerning the time of keeping Ea&s;ter, with tho&s;e between the Roman and Ea&s;tern church! In any other country &s;chool-boys have more learning; but, in &s;uch a night of ignorance, it is no wonder that all objects &s;eem alike.</P>
<P>The difference between the Roman and ea&s;tern church concerning Ea&s;ter, which began about the year 200, lay in this. The churches of A&s;ia ob|&s;erved this fea&s;t on the fourteenth moon, upon what&s;oever day of the week it fell out, being the day on which the Jews offered their pa&s;chal lamb. The church of Rome celebrated it on the Sunday following that day, if it chanced not to fall on Sunday; but did not, as the ea&s;tern churches had, from perpetual practice and tradition, ever done, celebrate Ea&s;ter on a week day. Thus the diffe|rence between the Roman and Ea&s;tern church only con&s;i&s;ted in <HI>&s;ix days</HI> at mo&s;t; and the only que&s;|tion was, whether Ea&s;ter was to be celebrated on
<PB N="264" REF="295">the week day on which it fell, or on the Sunday following<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">At the Council of Nice, A. D. 325, A&s;ia was forced to follow the European mode; and from that time till 532 all the world kept Ea&s;ter alike.</NOTE></P>
<P>Very different was the di&s;pute between the Ro|man church, and tho&s;e of Britain and Ireland, concerning Ea&s;ter. It began in the &s;ixth century upon this ground. In 532 Diony&s;ius Exiguus, a Roman prie&s;t, introduced a great variation into the mode of computing Ea&s;ter, of which the tech|nical terms would neither in&s;truct nor entertain the reader. Suffice it to &s;ay that his rule, adopted by the Roman church, threw the celebration of Ea&s;ter a whole <HI>month</HI> further back than before. But Britain and Ireland were as ob&s;tinate for their old Ea&s;ter, as they were lately for the old &s;tyle; and thus keeped Ea&s;ter a whole month before the Roman church. Cuminius, who lived at the time, &s;pecially mentions this difference of a month<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">U&s;&s;er. Sylloge, p. 34.</NOTE>; and the di&s;pute between the Roman, and the Bri|ti&s;h and Iri&s;h churches, was not known till Au|gu&s;tin the monk was &s;ent to convert the Saxons in 597. Adomnan<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lib. l. c. 3.</NOTE> tells us that columba about 585 prophe&s;ied concerning it. Nothing can be more ridiculous therefore, than to confound &s;uch different matters: and the dreams concerning ea&s;tern mi&s;&s;ionaries all fall to the ground of cour&s;e. Indeed it was ab&s;urd to infer &s;uch a con&s;equence at any rate; for the Scots or Iri&s;h were converted by the Briti&s;h, and the Piks or pre&s;ent Scoti&s;h by the Iri&s;h and Briti&s;h; &s;o that there was no occa&s;ion to go further than to the Briti&s;h, for the variation of Ea&s;ter. And the Briti&s;h, as we know from Eu&s;e|bius, in the time of Con&s;tantine I. ob&s;erved it in the &s;ame way as other we&s;tern nations. There is therefore no occa&s;ion to infer that the Britons were converted by ea&s;tern mi&s;&s;ionaries; nor that
<PB N="265" REF="296">the Scots or Iri&s;h, nor Piks or pre&s;ent Scots were; &s;eeing that the former were in the fourth century perfectly agreed with the Romans, and the later two nations were converted by the former. The variations of the Roman church were of far po&s;|terior date: and the Ea&s;tern church differed from the Briti&s;h, as from the Roman, even at the very fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e fables being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, it remains to &s;tate the truth concerning the conver&s;ion of the Piks or pre&s;ent Scots, as narrated by Beda, Lib. III. c. 4. We are there informed that, in the year 565, Columba came from Ireland to convert the northern Piks, or tho&s;e to the north of the Gram|pian hills. And upon this occa&s;ion Beda tells us, that the Piks on the &s;outh of tho&s;e hills had been converted by Ninian long before, <HI>multo ante tem|pore.</HI> The time when Ninian lived, is ea&s;ily ad|ju&s;ted from his life, written by Ailred the famous abbot of Reval, about 1150, or tran&s;lated from the Saxon, and a copy of which from that in the Bodleian library is now before me. It tells that Ninian, in his return from Rome, vi&s;ited St. Mar|tin at Tours, &amp;c. <HI>Floruit tune temporis beati&s;&s;imus Martinus, Turonicae civitatis epi&s;copus, cujus vita, miraculis glorio&s;a, jam ab eruditi&s;&s;imo viro &s;ancto Sul|picio de&s;cripta,</HI> &amp;c. Beda al&s;o informs us that Ninian dedicated the church he built to St. Mar|tin; and an old writer quoted by U&s;her &s;ays, that he did this, after he heard that St. Martin, whom he always much e&s;teemed, had left this life. But St. Martin, as appears from the well known life of him by Sulpicius Severus, and from many other te&s;timonies, flouri&s;hed from 370 to 398, in which la&s;t year he died. The learned and accurate U&s;her, who&s;e abilities in chronology are now univer&s;ally acknowledged, fixes the conver&s;ion of the &s;outhern Piks by Ninian at the year 412.</P>
<P>Our antiqui&s;ts, who certainly bear the palm of ignorance from all others in Europe, &s;uppo&s;e the
<PB N="266" REF="297">&s;outhern Piks converted by Ninian to have been in Galloway, becau&s;e Beda &s;ays the church and epi&s;copal &s;ee of Ninian was at Whithern in Gal|loway. There were no Piks in Galloway, till 426 at &s;oone&s;t. Galloway in Ninian's time was in the province of Valentia; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Cumraig Britons, and Roman &s;oldiers. Ninian was not a bi&s;hop of the Piks, nor was his &s;ee among them. He went to convert them after he was bi&s;hop; and his church and &s;ee were among his country|men the Cumraig Britons. Not to mention his Life by Ailred, Beda &s;ufficiently explains this: <HI>praedicante eis verbum Nynia epi&s;copo;</HI> and <HI>cujus &s;edem epi&s;copatus ad Candidam Ca&s;am, eo quod ibi eccle&s;iam de lapide, in&s;olito</HI> BRITONIBUS <HI>more, fecerit.</HI> But it is needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t on &s;uch a blunder. The Piks converted by Ninian were tho&s;e between the Forth and the Grampian hills, as is clear not only from Beda, but from Adomnan, who repre&s;ents Columba as keeping always on the north of the&s;e hills. Ninian converted the <HI>Vecturiones,</HI> Columba the <HI>Dicaledones,</HI> the grand and natural divi&s;ions of the Piks, in the time of Ammianus, as fully ex|plained before. Hence Ninian a Cumraig Briton, and Columba an Iri&s;hman, are to be regarded as the apo&s;tles of the Piks, or pre&s;ent Scots. Let us now proceed to the chronology of a few facts recoverable, in the ancient eccle&s;ia&s;tic hi&s;tory of North Britain.</P>

In pre&s;ent Scotland the bi&s;hopric of Galloway, or Whithern, is que&s;tionle&s;s the olde&s;t: next is that of Gla&s;gow, if we admit Kentigern to have been a bi&s;hop: next is that of Abercorn or Lothian, while that province was &s;ubject to Northumbria 547 to 685. The abbot of Hyona having &s;uch &s;upreme power over the Piki&s;h churches, certainly would not allow of any bi&s;hop's &s;ee, as the title was &s;uperior to his own, and could not be controuled by him. Abernethy and Dunkeld were but abbacies, even in the eleventh century, long after St. Andrews was a bi&s;hopric. Indeed all our writers, ancient and modern, concur that St. Andrews was the mo&s;t ancient bi&s;hopric, north of Clyde and Forth.</P>
<P>The origin of the bi&s;hopric of St. And rews has been handled by many authors. The learned and accurate Ruddiman puts Kellach as the fir&s;t bi&s;hop; and Kellach lived as we know from the <HI>Chron. Pict.</HI> in the &s;ixth year of Con&s;tantin III. or 909. But Tighernac, and the Annals of Ul&s;ter, furni&s;h us with a bi&s;hop of Pikland much ealier; for at the year 864, they &s;ay <HI>Tuahal Mac Artgu&s;a, archbi&s;hop of Fortren, and abbot of Dun Callen dor|mivit,</HI> 'Tuahal &s;on of Artgus, archbi&s;hop of Pik|land, and abbot of Dunkeld, died.' This would lead us to &s;u&s;pect that after Hyona was de&s;troyed by the Danes,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>A. D. 801. <HI>Ann.

<PB N="269" REF="300">churches cea&s;ed, the abbot of Dunkeld was for a time regarded as &s;upreme of the Piki&s;h church. Certain it is that St. Andrew's had no title to be regarded as &s;upreme church in Pikland, till erec|ted into a bi&s;hopric. And there is rea&s;on to be|lieve that this happened in the reign of Achy and Grig, 883&mdash;894. For Fordun and Winton &s;ay that Kellach, the fir&s;t bi&s;hop, lived in the time of Grig, or their Gregory; and this agrees with the <HI>Chron. Pict.</HI> which mentions him as yet living un|der Con&s;tantin III. 909, or fifteen years after the expul&s;ion of Achy and Grig. A &s;ingular pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Reg. St. And.</HI> in the reign of Grig al&s;o &s;trengthens this; <HI>Et hic primus dedit libertatem ec|cle&s;iae Scoticanae, quae &s;ub &s;ervitute erat u&s;que ad illud tempus, ex con&s;titutione et more Pictorum.</HI> 'He fir&s;t gave freedom to the Scoti&s;h church, which till that time was in &s;ervitude, by the con&s;titution and cu&s;tom of the Piks.' This &s;urely refers to the &s;ubjection of the Piki&s;h churches to Hyona; from which they were delivered, by erecting St. An|drews into a bi&s;hopric. Our clergy, in gratitude, gave much fabulous prai&s;e to Grig, as was their cu&s;tom in &s;uch ca&s;es; and &s;ay that he conquered Ireland, and mo&s;t of England. I cannot help &s;u&s;|pecting that this &s;ubjection of the Piki&s;h churches to Hyona, contributed to render the name of Piks odious to our clergy, and to recommend that of Scots, that they might transfer the old eccle&s;ia&s;tic power of the Scots in Pikland to them&s;elves, as al&s;o Scots. For the &s;eminary of Hyona being now de&s;troyed, and Ireland &s;ubject to the Scandi|navians enemies of Pikland, &s;uch native clergy as now aro&s;e, affected the name of Scots &s;o revered by long cu&s;tom, and &s;o &s;uperior in eccle&s;ia&s;tic matters; and at &s;ame time naturally hated their
<PB N="270" REF="301">old &s;piritual ma&s;ters the Iri&s;h. Our native clergy, being however di&s;tant from the then chief &s;eats of learning, France and Germany, were long &s;o deficient that our kings were glad to have clergy from England; as the examples of Turgot and of Eadmer, both bi&s;hops of St. Andrews, may witne&s;s. And to this local &s;ituation was it owing, that while Ireland and England from proximity to France, and afterward Scandinavia from proxi|mity to Germany, produced many writers, not one aro&s;e in Pikland till the thirteenth century, when Michael Scot and others flouri&s;hed. When this is con&s;idered, it is no wonder that our hi&s;tory is be|hind that of every country in Europe.</P>
<P>The other bi&s;hops of St. Andrews, the only bi&s;hopric in that tract, after 1016 called Scotland proper, as before Albany and Pikland; and hence called &s;imply <HI>epi&s;copi</HI> in our old fragments; were, after Kellach, <HI>Fothad,</HI> who was expelled by king Indulf 954&mdash;962, <HI>Fordun,</HI> and died in the time of Odo 962&mdash;966. <HI>Chron. Pict.</HI> The third was <HI>Maelbriget,</HI> called Mali&s;ius by Fordun, who died in Culen's time 966&mdash;971. <HI>Chron. Pict.</HI> The fourth was <HI>Kellach</HI> II. &s;on of Ferdulaig, who &s;uc|ceeded Maelbriget, <HI>ib.</HI> and died about 996. The fifth <HI>Malis:</HI> the &s;ixth <HI>Malmer,</HI> from 996 to 1031. The &s;eventh <HI>Alwin,</HI> 1031 to 1035. The eighth Malduin, 1034 to 1061. Except the journey of Macbeth to Rome 1050, there is no rea&s;on to be|lieve that the Piki&s;h churches paid any homage to the Roman. Hyona was their Rome till the end of the ninth century; and king Grig, not the Pope, made St. Andrews a bi&s;hopric, as above &s;hewn from our old fragments. Even the pil|grimage of Macbeth was merely to Rome as a holy city, as others went pilgrims to Jeru&s;alem. Scotland was too poor for papal rapacity or u&s;ur|pation. In 1126 the fir&s;t legate John of Crema appeared in Scotland; and before that time there is not a trace of any papal power in Scotland.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="302">This chapter &s;hall be clo&s;ed with a few hints concerning the Culdees. It is well known that a violent di&s;pute was long carried on, by the pre&s;|byterian and epi&s;copal writers, concerning this noted cla&s;s of men. Selden, Sir James Dalrymple, and other pre&s;byterian writers, would have the Culdees to be a &s;ort of pre&s;byters, &s;trangers to the Roman church, and to epi&s;copacy. Lloyd, Stil|ling fleet and Keith, will have them to have been epi&s;copal. The be&s;t account of them yet given, is doubtle&s;s that pre&s;ixt to Keith's Catalogue of Scoti&s;h bi&s;hops; and from thence it is clear, from ancient charters, that the Culdees, far from being enemies to epi&s;copacy, were the very men who cho&s;e the bi&s;hops. Doubtle&s;s he who expects to find in Scotland matters not to be found in any neighbouring country, only &s;hews his own credu|lity: and that, from the fourth century, every Chri&s;tian country had its bi&s;hops, is too well known to be in&s;i&s;ted on. But that the&s;e bi&s;hops differed very much from the warlike bi&s;hops of the ninth, and following centuries, and from the opulent and idle bi&s;hops of later times, is as clear.</P>
<P>When St. Martin fir&s;t brought monks into Eu|rope, about the year 380, their rigid life acquired them high e&s;teem. In a &s;hort time the bi&s;hops were chiefly cho&s;en from their order: and after|ward, u&s;urping the right of the people, they be|gan to chu&s;e the bi&s;hops from among them&s;elves. Hence, in the middle ages, almo&s;t every mona|&s;tery had its bi&s;hop, almo&s;t every bi&s;hopric its mona&s;tery. Nay the abbot, or chief of the mona|&s;tery, was &s;ometimes e&s;teemed &s;uperior in dignity to the bi&s;hop; that is in every thing not immedi|ately belonging to the epi&s;copal function. Of this the mona&s;tery of Hyona, the &s;eminary of Chri&s;ti|anity in North Britain, affords a noted in&s;tance<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>Regente mona&s;terium abbate, quem ip&s;i epi&s;copi cum cou&s;ilio fratrum elegerint, omnes pre&s;byteri, diaconi, canto|res, lectores, ceterique gradus eccle&s;ia&s;tici, monachicam per omnia, cum ip&s;o epi&s;copo, regulam &s;ervant.

<P><PB N="272" REF="303">Hence the abbot of Hyona was in effect primate of Scotland, till the ninth century. When Hyona had been ravaged by the Danes, Dunkeld was the primatial &s;ee, till the reign of Grig and Achy, A. D. 883, from which time St. Andrews held that &s;upremacy. But the high rank of the abbots of Dunkeld, one of whom was the father of a royal race of Scotland, and another, Ethelred, the &s;on of Malcom III. &s;ufficiently marks the e&s;tima|tion in which that dignity was long held. In Abernethy, Dunkeld, &amp;c. it is rea&s;onable to infer that there were bi&s;hops, as well as at Hyona; but being &s;ubject to the abbots, they attracted no at|tention.</P>
<P>The Culdees were &s;urely only Iri&s;h clergy. At fir&s;t they &s;eem to have been regular monks, who followed the rule of St. Columba; and generally their &s;ocieties con&s;i&s;ted of twelve and a chief<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Keith, pref.</NOTE>, in imitation either of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles; or of Columba and the twelve monks who came with him from Ireland<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Adomnan, ad fin.</NOTE>.

Dalrymple, &amp;c.</NOTE>: and, after the ha|vock introduced by the Danes, u&s;urped the rank of &s;ecular clergy. In &s;hort, they were merely cor|rupted monks, &s;uch as abounded in all the coun|tries of Europe, till the eleventh century, when the popes were forced to in&s;titute canons regular, whom the princes gradually introduced into the chief mona&s;teries, in&s;tead of the old depraved monks<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;heim, In&s;t. Hi&s;t. Eccl. The common canons began in the eighth century; and were a middle order, between monks and &s;ecular prie&s;ts. <HI>Ib.</HI></NOTE>. Henry I. brought the&s;e canons into England; and &s;oon after we find the Scoti&s;h &s;ove|reigns turning out the Culdees, to make way for
<PB N="273" REF="304">the&s;e canons. The various modern &s;ort of mona|&s;tic names and orders, it is well known, did not begin till the twelfth century.</P>
<P>The Culdees thus united in them&s;elves, the di&s;|tinctions of monks and of &s;ecular clergy; being apparently, from Columba's time to the eleventh century, the only monks and clergy in Scotland; and all Iri&s;h, as formerly &s;hewn. At St. Andrew's the Culdees elected the bi&s;hops till 1140, and exi&s;ted there till 1297<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Keith.</NOTE>: at Dunkeld, Dumblane, and Brechin, they elected the bi&s;hops yet later than at St. Andrew's.

<P N="1">1. THE STRATCLYDE WELCH. <HI>Ninian</HI> may be regarded as belonging to them: but, alas! from the want of literature which &s;o long pre|vailed among the Southern Piks, his converts, it is too clear that he was a pious man, but a &s;tranger to letters; el&s;e he would never have neglected &s;o e&s;&s;ential a part of his mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Patrick</HI> was born at Nemthur, near Alclud or Dunbarton, now thought to be Old Kirkpatrick, From his own name <HI>Patricius,</HI> and that of his fa|ther <HI>Calphurnius,</HI> he appears to have been of Ro|man extract; and he was indeed born about the year 400, when the Romans po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Valentia. In 432 he went to Ireland; and after converting that whole iland, died about 480. He was cer|tainly a man of extraordinary talents, for the
<PB N="275" REF="306">time and country. His fir&s;t and greate&s;t care was to teach the Iri&s;h the u&s;e of letters, as the prime mean of making their conver&s;ion permanent. Would that he had al&s;o been the apo&s;tle of the Piks, or that Ninian and Columba had &s;hewn &s;uch care! The &s;upreme veneration, in which the Iri&s;h always held, and &s;till hold Patrick, is mo&s;t de&s;erved and ju&s;t: while it is no wonder that Ninian and Columba were forgotten among us. Two genuine epi&s;tles of Patrick are pre|&s;erved, and have been publi&s;hed by Ware.</P>
<P><HI>Gildas</HI> Albanius, or the &s;aint, was &s;on of a king of Alclyde, and born as U&s;her collects about 425. He mu&s;t be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from that Gildas, who wrote the book <HI>De excidio Britonum;</HI> and who lived a century after. The epithet <HI>Albanius</HI> marks the pre&s;ent, as a native of Albany or Scotland. Caradoc of Llancarvon, the Welch hi&s;torian, wrote the life of St. Gildas, who was only remarkable for &s;uperior piety, and was no writer.</P>
<P>The only other native of Stratclyde here to be mentioned is <HI>Merlinus Caledonius,</HI> otherwi&s;e called Merlin the Wild. This extraordinary, or per|haps fabulous, per&s;onage lived at Alclyde, in the time of king Roderch, and was thus cotemporary with Kentigern, A. D. 570. The other and more famous Merlin, the Magician, lived as appears from Nennius in the time of Vortigern, or more than a century before him of Caledonia. A curi|ous life of Merlin the Wild, written in Latin ver&s;e by Geofrey of Monmouth, is extant, and extracts may be found below<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><Q><LG>

But let us now examine the cau&s;es of this deplorable de|fect of literature among the Piks.</P>
<P N="3">III. REASONS WHY LEARNING WAS UNKNOWN IN PIKLAND, TILL THE XIIITH CENTURY.</P>
<P N="1">1. The want of learning, and of talents in the apo&s;tles of the Piks, may be regarded as one great cau&s;e of this deplorable defect. Ninian and Columba were of confined minds, and of bigotted piety, &s;trangers to &s;ecular learning, and to tho&s;e enlarged ideas which prompted Ulphilas, Patrick, and in later times the apo&s;tles of Scandinavia, to impart the u&s;e of letters, as the fir&s;t foundation among their converts. The&s;e apo&s;tles of the Piks, as appears from their lives, were men lo&s;t in gloomy bigotry. Patrick under&s;tood the Iri&s;h language him&s;elf; while Columba was forced to u&s;e an interpreter among the Piks, as Adomnan tells: whereas he ought to have &s;tudied their lan|guage in the very fir&s;t place. Bollandus has ob|&s;erved that in the Welch and Iri&s;h lives of &s;aints, the miracles and vi&s;ions are &s;o numerous and ab&s;urd, and the whole tenor &s;o unlike tho&s;e of other coun|tries, that he did not know what to think of them. But this was the natural fruit of that &s;trange cre|dulity, and weakne&s;s of mind, peculiar to the
<PB N="278" REF="309">Celts. The lives of Ninian and of Columba &s;warm with &s;uch puerile miracles, as are really impious, nay bla&s;phemous; while every thing that is rational, wi&s;e, and truly virtuous, is forgotten. Such Celtic apo&s;tles were not calculated to en|lighten and civilize a nation; and, illiterate them&s;elves, could never impart literature to others.</P>
<P N="2">2. To a late period, the only common clergy in Pikland were Iri&s;h, as is clear from there be|ing no Piki&s;h &s;aints or churchmen to be found in hi&s;tory, or in &s;anctology; from Hyona being the &s;eminary of the Piki&s;h church; and from &s;uch fragments of our hi&s;tory as remain, which bear Iri&s;h epithets, names, &amp;c. and which were certainly written by clergy, the only literati of the time. The offices of the church were per|formed in Latin; nay the homilies preached in that language, as appears from tho&s;e of Beda, and others, and as all conver&s;ant in eccle&s;ia&s;tic hi&s;tory know. There was of cour&s;e no nece&s;&s;ity for the clergy to learn the Piki&s;h language. Even in England, as appears from Beda, mo&s;t of the clergy were Iri&s;h; and came from Ireland and Hyona to Engli&s;h &s;ees at once, having no nece&s;&s;ity to know the common language, Latin alone being nece&s;&s;ary. The divine &s;ervice, and preachings, tho in Latin, it was an office of piety to attend; but &s;carce one in an audience under&s;tood a word, &s;o that they could not in|&s;truct the people. And the Iri&s;h clergy, for their own intere&s;t, retained the Piki&s;h church to them&s;elves; and never excited Piki&s;h youth to qualify them&s;elves for the church, which they re|garded as their own peculiar portion.</P>
<P N="3">3. As the&s;e Celtic clergy were &s;trangers to the liberal &s;entiments of true wi&s;dom, &s;o they had all that cunning which is the wi&s;dom of folly, and all that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s which attends a narrow mind. This is evident from the conduct of Columba,
<PB N="279" REF="310">and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The in&s;titution of Hyona, an Iri&s;h &s;eminary, as &s;upreme church of Pikland, was, and is, without example in eccle&s;ia&s;tic hi&s;|tory. The metropolitan church ought to have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in the heart of Pikland; and, as in other countries, all means &s;hould have been u&s;ed to furni&s;h a native clergy. In&s;tead of which all the churches were in utter &s;ubjection to Hyona, a foreign &s;eminary; and their clergy furni&s;hed and commi&s;&s;ioned from thence. Thus the intere&s;t of religion was &s;acrificed to the meane&s;t avarice and ambition: and Hyona may be regarded as the Rome of Pikland, &s;upporting its own power and intere&s;t, by keeping the &s;ub|jects of its church in ignorance. When the church of St. Andrew's was made metropolitan by kings Achy and Grig, at the end of the ninth century, it was long before a native clergy could be formed; and the Iri&s;h clergy from &s;u|perior opportunities and learning, and from an|cient veneration and cu&s;tom, &s;till held the com|mon offices of the church, even down to the twelfth or thirteenth century. Intere&s;t, national &s;pirit, and eccle&s;ia&s;tic party, long maintained them; and they were only &s;upplanted by degrees, as the natives from advanced &s;ociety, and vi&s;iting foreign univer&s;ities, began to acquire learning; and to &s;hake off tho&s;e bonds of ignorance, in which remote &s;ituation, and the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of the Iri&s;h clergy, &s;o long held them. Hyona was indeed no longer the &s;eminary; but as the Iri&s;h clergy had been &s;ettled in the churches of Pik|land, and married among them&s;elves, like the tribe of Levi, the only change was, that there were many Iri&s;h &s;eminaries in&s;tead of one.</P>
<P N="4">4. The local &s;ituation of Pikland was inimical to the learning of its natives. Of the other ex|treme countries of Europe, Scandinavia was only &s;eparated by a narrow &s;ea from Germany, a country full of &s;chools, learning, and authors,
<PB N="280" REF="311">before Scandinavia was converted. England and Ireland were in the &s;ame &s;ituation, with re&s;pect to France, another learned country. Whereas Pik|land was the mo&s;t remote corner in Europe; and le&s;s known of cour&s;e than any country in it; not being mentioned by any writers on the con|tinent during the middle ages. The learning of Ireland, &s;uch as it was, the Iri&s;h clergy, from &s;pecial motives above explained, did not impart to the Piks. That of England was intercepted by mutual enmity, and by the Danes, who, &s;eizing the North of England, debarred all in|tercour&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. Want of commerce was another cau&s;e; for a nation cannot be learned without books. Af|ter the Saracens &s;eized Egypt, in the &s;eventh century, manu&s;cripts became extremely &s;carce, as no papyrus could be had. Paper made of &s;ilk, and of cotton, was not invented till the eleventh century: our common paper not till the four|teenth. Parchment had never been common, as it was always dear, and only u&s;ed on important occa&s;ions. The books that &s;warmed in Greek and Roman times, almo&s;t as much as now, were written on papyrus, a grand article of Egyptian commerce. When this failed, books became extremely &s;carce, and continued &s;o till paper was invented. But while, for want of books, even the learning of Greece, Italy, Germany, France, was at a low ebb; it was no wonder that Pik|land had none at all. England, Ireland, Scandi|navia, were all frequented by foreign merchants; while the remote &s;ituation of Pikland, and its want of materials for commerce, rendered it un|vi&s;ited, and almo&s;t unknown.</P>
<P N="6">6. The warlike &s;pirit of the Piks, and conti|nual occa&s;ions for its exertion, were inimical to learning. In Ireland, at the time clerical learning flouri&s;hed there, dome&s;tic wars abounded; but the parties reverenced the clergy, who enjoyed
<PB N="281" REF="312" MS="y">quiet among the&s;e commotions. Very different was the ca&s;e in the ninth century, when foreign enemies ravaging Ireland, bani&s;hed all its learning at once. But Pikland, not being a detached country, like Ireland, but acting on perpetual offence or defence again&s;t a foreign foe, was al|mo&s;t in con&s;tant war, or preparation; a &s;tate to|tally inimical to learning.</P>
<P N="7">7. The natural poverty of the country pre|cluded learning, as it did other advantages. For learning belongs to ea&s;e; and in a poor country and early &s;ociety conjoined, con&s;tant labour mu&s;t be employed to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Even the church was poor, and had not above three grand e&s;tabli&s;hments, Abernethy, Dunkeld, and St. An|drew's: whereas in Ireland the e&s;tabli&s;hments, from the earlie&s;t period, were very numerous, as the fertility of the country invited. Among &s;o few churchmen, it is no wonder that learning was &s;carce; as the chance was &s;o much &s;maller than in other countries. Hence, even among the Iri&s;h clergy of Pikland, very few had any talents or learning. The whole inhabitants of Pikland did not exceed a million; for they do not exceed that number now, and the population is &s;urely en|crea&s;ed. The chance of one man of learning ari&s;ing in that number, at a time when Germany, France, England, produced but one or two, was next to nothing; and it is no wonder that it never took place; but on the contrary a miracle mu&s;t have happened, if it had.</P>
<P N="8">8. The northern Goths of Scandinavia, of whom the Piks were a branch, were long remark|able for contempt of letters; and regarded them as one of the effeminate pur&s;uits of ea&s;e, beneath the notice of warriors. This contempt had a greater effect than indocility could have had; and was radically inimical to learning: for what is de&s;pi&s;ed can never be an object of pur&s;uit. The plain &s;en&s;e of the&s;e people was indeed remarkably
<PB N="282" REF="313">&s;trong and acute; and it is no wonder that the ab&s;urd &s;uper&s;tition, and fooli&s;h reading, of the clergy, during the darker ages, met utter &s;corn from their &s;evere wi&s;dom. Ragnar Lodbrog's ex|pre&s;&s;ion of a <HI>ma&s;s of weapons,</HI> &s;hews the greate&s;t contempt of the then Chri&s;tian &s;uper&s;tition, and its profe&s;&s;ors. And as they de&s;pi&s;ed the literati of the time, &s;o they &s;corned letters, and regarded arms as the &s;ole object of pur&s;uit.</P>
<P N="9">9. At the time the Scandinavians began their ravages in Europe, the Iri&s;h clergy of Hyona were the &s;ole churchmen in Pikland; and keeped the people in ignorance, as above explained. But tho&s;e ravages, &s;o inimical to French and Engli&s;h literature, totally extingui&s;hed the Iri&s;h; &s;o that even the &s;ole fountain, whence clerical learning could have flowed into Pikland, was dried up. And Pikland it&s;elf was repeatedly ravaged by the Scandinavians, in the ninth century; which mu&s;t have checked learning, if any was then be|ginning to bud. The Iri&s;h clergy, after this, produced no Cuminius or Adomnan. Nor, till the thirteenth century, was any thing written by the&s;e only literati we had; &s;ave a few li&s;ts of our kings, untinctured with any reading, except that of Nennius and I&s;idorus. The ravages of the Scandinavians may therefore be regarded as a grand cau&s;e, that delayed the commencement of literature in Pikland to a late period: as other cau&s;es above-mentioned prevented its taking place before tho&s;e ravages.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t any of the&s;e cau&s;es may &s;ufficiently ac|count for the very late appearance of learning among the Piks, or pre&s;ent Scots; but when all are jointly con&s;idered, it is believed they will be found fully &s;atisfactory.</P>

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT. The Angles, and the Norwegians.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>The Angles.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO render this work more complete, it is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Angles, and tho&s;e of the Norwegians, in pre&s;ent Scotland. The nations, who in the fifth and &s;ixth centuries &s;ettled in pre&s;ent England, were three; the Jutes, who fixed in Kent, the Saxons who held the re&s;t of the &s;outh; and the Angles who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the country north of the Humber, and &s;ome other tracts on the north of the Saxons. The Jutes arrived in 449; the fir&s;t Saxons in 477; the fir&s;t Angles in 547. The Jutes were originally in the north of pre&s;ent Jutland, to which they af|terward gave a general name. The Angles were in the &s;outh of pre&s;ent Jutland. The Saxons ex|tended from the &s;outh of Jutland, to the Rhine. The Jutes and Angles were Scandinavian Goths, and of tho&s;e who expelled the Cimbri about 110 years before Chri&s;t. The Saxons were German Goths.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="316">The Celts of Britain and Ireland called all the&s;e three nations by the general name of Saxons; and the Jutes and Angli are termed Saxons by Gildas, Nennius, Tighernach, and other Welch and Iri&s;h writers. Beda, on the contrary, who was an Angle of Northumbria, gives them the general name of Angli, which has &s;ince prevailed. But by a &s;trict enquirer, the three nations mu&s;t be con&s;idered apart; and not in the confu&s;ion of a general name. Hence it will occur, that the Angles who held the north of pre&s;ent England, and e&s;pecially fir&s;t &s;et|tled in Northumbria, the olde&s;t Anglic kingdom, are the only nation of the three who could hold po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in pre&s;ent Scotland.</P>
<P>But a fable mu&s;t here be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Nennius, who wrote in 858, calls the people who, in 449, came to Kent under Hengi&s;t and Hor&s;a, by the general name of Saxons, tho from Beda's expre&s;s te&s;timony they were Jutes. Among others of the mo&s;t childi&s;h and unchronologic fables Nennius tells cap. 37, that after the marriage of Vortiger and Rowena, or about 453, Hengi&s;t prevailed on Vortiger to permit Ohta his &s;on, and Ebi&s;&s;a &s;on of Hor&s;a, to &s;ettle in the north near the walls. That they came with forty &s;hips; navigated a|round the Piks; wa&s;ted the Orkneys; <HI>et occupa|verunt plurimas regiones trans mare Fre&s;icum, i. e. quod inter nos Scoto&s;que e&s;t, u&s;que ad confinia Picto|rum;</HI> 'and occupied many countries beyond the Fre&s;ic &s;ea, or that between us and the Scots, even to the confines of the Piks.'</P>
<P>This tale of Nennius fell into the hands of William of Malm&s;bury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It al&s;o occurs in Geofrey of Monmouth.</NOTE>, a re&s;pectable hi&s;torian; but, as he wrote about 1150, he is yet a wor&s;e authority than Nennius for &s;o remote an event. Malm&s;bury &s;ays, Lib. I. c. 1. 'Hengi&s;t, abu&s;ing the king's imprudence, per&s;uaded him to call his brother and &s;on, brave men, from Germany;
<PB N="287" REF="317">that, as he defended the country on the ea&s;t, &s;o they might bridle the Scots on the north. So the king conniving, they, after &s;ailing around Britain, went to the Orkneys; and involving the&s;e nations in the &s;ame calamity with the Piks and Scots, they then and after &s;ettled in the northern part of the iland now called Northumbria. Yet none there u&s;ed the royal badge, or name, till Ida, from whom the lineage of Northumbrian kings grew. But of this below.' Accordingly c. 3. he proceeds, 'We have above &s;aid in few words, and now repeat, that Hengi&s;t, having confirmed his kingdom in Kent, &s;ent his brother Otha, and &s;on Ebu&s;a, men of bold and tried experience, to oc|cupy the northern parts of Britain. They pro|ceeding, as commanded, had a fortune agreeable to their endeavours. For fighting often with the provincials, and defeating tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;ted, they allured the re&s;t by receiving their fidelity in quiet. Tho they thus gained &s;ome power by their own arts, and the favour of their &s;ubjects, yet they a&s;|&s;umed not the &s;tyle of kings, nor did their fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. For a hundred years all but one, the Northumbrian leaders, content with common dre&s;s, lived private, under the dominion of the kings of Kent. But in the year 547, and 60 after the death of Hengi&s;t, the dukedom was changed to a king|dom; and Ida reigned there fir&s;t: but whether he &s;eized the kingdom, or was elected, is unknown.'</P>
<P>Selden in his Titles of Honour, Lib. II. c. 5. tells us that the dignity of Ealdorman, or Earl, was both feudal and hereditary, from the very fir&s;t arrival of the Saxons; and quotes the above la&s;t pa&s;&s;age of Malm&s;bury to confirm it. Selden knew more of Syriac and Arabic, than of the hi&s;tory of his country, or antiquities of the middle ages; and tho learned in Syrian mythology, was in the hi&s;tory of his country, and middle antiquities, a mere dabler. Indeed had he paid due attention to the later, he could have found no time to at|tend

<PB N="288" REF="320">to ea&s;tern learning. The account of Malm&s;|bury, which he founds on, is a mere fable grafted on a fable of Nennius, and confutes it&s;elf. The &s;ailing around Britain; the inva&s;ion of the Ork|neys, in order to obtain a &s;ettlement in Northum|bria; the title of dukes and dukedom; the feudal &s;ubjection of Northumbria, a country four times the &s;ize of the kingdom of Kent; the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of dukes, a matter unknown then ex|cept of kings; the ignorance concerning Ida, who, as we know from Beda, and the Saxon Chronicle, was the very fir&s;t leader of the Angles to Britain; all the&s;e circum&s;tances brand this ac|count as a gro&s;s and ab&s;urd fiction. And as Beda, the Saxon Chronicle, Ethelwerd, Florence of Worce&s;ter, or all the writers preceding Malm&s;|bury, except Nennius only, know nothing of this colony; it is clear that Malm&s;bury's te&s;timony on &s;o remote an event amounts to nothing. But Nennius de&s;erves examination.</P>
<P>The work of Nennius and Samuel is de&s;ervedly con&s;idered as the weake&s;t, that ever bore the name of hi&s;tory. Its fables are &s;o childi&s;h and gro|te&s;que, as to di&s;grace the human mind. Yet weak as it is, it has not reached us in its original &s;tate, but is full of corruptions and interpolations. No man therefore of the &s;malle&s;t reflection would found an hi&s;toric fact on the <HI>&s;ole</HI> te&s;timony of &s;uch a work. But Nennius is palpably the &s;ole autho|rity of William of Malm&s;bury. It is remarkable that at the end of Nennius, we find genealogies of Northumbrian kings, confe&s;&s;edly not by Nennius, but by &s;ome Northumbrian writer. And it &s;eems probable that this account of Ohta and Ebi&s;a is interpolated by the &s;ame Northumbrian hand, in order to rai&s;e the antiquity of that &s;ettlement, to a par with the earlie&s;t of the others. But allowing the pa&s;&s;age to be of Nennius or Samuel, their work is &s;o gro&s;&s;ly fabulous, that its te&s;timony can|not be weighed again&s;t Gildas and Beda, who are
<PB N="289" REF="321">quite &s;ilent as to this memorable event; nor even again&s;t later, but authentic writers, the Saxon Chronicler, Ethelwerd, Florence of Worce&s;ter. The pa&s;&s;age of Nennius is unintelligible; for the <HI>Mare Fre&s;icum</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Except Jocelin in his life of Kentigern, who mi&s;taking Nennius, implies it the frith of Forth.</NOTE> is not mentioned by any other writer, but is quite unknown. It cannot be the frith of Forth, becau&s;e it is clear, from Beda, that the Jutes or Saxons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no tract <HI>beyond</HI> that ae&s;tuary; nor could Nennius have added 'even to the confines of the Piks,' for they held all down to the wall of Severus after 426, as above &s;hewn from Beda and others. It cannot be Solway frith, for it was not between the Welch and Scots, as Nennius &s;ays; nor did Beda know of any Jutes or Saxons in Galloway. The <HI>Scoti</HI> of Nennius are infallibly the Iri&s;h; and the <HI>Mare-Fre&s;icum,</HI> mu&s;t be that between England and Ireland, anciently called <HI>Vergivium.</HI> The Welch have no V, but always u&s;e F for it: and i doubt not but &s;ome tran&s;criber has put <HI>Fre&s;icum</HI> for <HI>Fergicum.</HI> This &s;ea not only pa&s;&s;es between Ireland and Wales, <HI>inter nos Scoto&s;que,</HI> but forms a va&s;t bay between Wales and the north of England, &s;o that a &s;ettle|ment on the &s;outh of the wall of Gallio, would be <HI>trans mare Fre&s;icum,</HI> re&s;pecting Wales. This is clearly the meaning of Nennius, as he al&s;o &s;ays that the regions demanded by Hengi&s;t for his &s;on and nephew were, <HI>juxta murum qui vocatur Gual.</HI> But it is needle&s;s to explain the meaning of a fable, for &s;uch this whole &s;tory certainly is, for the following rea&s;ons.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Gildas, the mo&s;t ancient Briti&s;h writer, knew nothing of this &s;ettlement.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Beda not only knew nothing of it, but is a deci&s;ive witne&s;s again&s;t it; for tho living in Nor|thumbria, and particular as to its hi&s;tory, he men|tions no Jutes there, nor Saxons; but on the con|trary tells us, I. 15. that the people of Northum|bria
<PB N="290" REF="322">were Angles, and tho&s;e of Kent Jutes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Nennius and Samuel were po&s;terior to the&s;e two.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Their work is full of mon&s;trous fables.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. It is corrupt and interpolated beyond example.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Later authentic writers, the Saxon Chronicle, Ethelwerd, Florence of Worce&s;ter, know nothing of this &s;ettlement; and a po&s;terior author Malm&s;|bury only copies, and adds to, Nennius.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. This is the only &s;ettlement which left not a trace be|hind it, in&s;omuch that Mr. Gibbon &s;ays, that it mu&s;t have been &s;oon cut off<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Decline and Fall of the Rom. Emp. vol. V. p. 345. 8vo.</NOTE>; but in fact it never exi&s;ted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. The account of Malm&s;bury is ab&s;urd, and &s;elf-contradictory, as above &s;hewn, nay im|po&s;&s;ible, as it is incongruous with the manners of the times; and Selden confe&s;&s;es he could find no other example of feudal and hereditary leaders; and as it contradicts common &s;en&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e that Northumbria, a country four times as large as the Kenti&s;h kingdom, &s;hould be a mere earl|dom dependent of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. The Saxon Chronicle tells us in expre&s;s terms, that Ida arrived in Bri|tain, with his people the Angles, in 40 &s;hips, only the year he became king 547; &s;o that he had no connection with tho&s;e imaginary Dukes, as Malm&s;bury &s;uppo&s;es.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This fable overturned, little remains for this &s;ection. The Angles were of Scandinavian ex|tract, but had &s;eized on the &s;outh of pre&s;ent Jutland; whence, in 547, the fir&s;t colony of them came to Britain under Ida, a great and va|liant leader. The Saxon Chronicle &s;ays they came in XL &s;hips, John of Wallingford in LX. This colony could not exceed 10,000 or 12,000; and it conquered and &s;ettled among the Piks, who, as formerly &s;hewn, held now all the tract down to the Humber. Ida &s;eized on the north part of Northumbria, and founded the kingdom of Bernicia; reaching in his reign, or &s;oon after,
<PB N="291" REF="323">from Tei&s;e to Forth. The kingdom of Deira, or pre&s;ent York&s;hire, was founded by Ella, al&s;o an Anglic prince in 559; but only la&s;ted forty years, when Adelfrid king of Bernicia conquered it, and erected all Northumbria into one king|dom; being the mo&s;t important and famous of the heptarchy. Beda, and the other literati of the heptarchy, were all of Northumbria; and yet its hi&s;tory is ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>In 685 Egfrid, king of Northumbria, ravag|ing Pikland, was defeated, and &s;lain by king Brudi, &s;on of Bili; upon which the Piks reco|vered dominion of the &s;outh ea&s;t of pre&s;ent Scot|land, down to the Tweed. Trumwin, Anglic bi&s;hop of the Piks of Lothian, was forced to leave Abercorn and fly. After this, as Beda &s;ays, the Northumbrian power gradually declined till his time, 731, nay after, till the extinction of the Anglic kingdom about 840. Till this la&s;t event however the Angles retained all the country &s;outh of Tweed, from its mouth to its fountain, and &s;o in a line to the Iri&s;h &s;ea. Melros and Whithern, the &s;outh of Galloway, and perhaps Cuningham and Kyle, remained theirs, till the fall of the Northumbrian kingdom. About 850, Kenneth, king of the Piks, burned Melro&s;e, as an u&s;urpa|tion on his &s;tates; and about the &s;ame time the Piks &s;eized on the Anglic po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Gal|loway. Baldulf, 790,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malm&s;b. Ge&s;t. Pont. fol. v. 155.</NOTE> was the la&s;t Anglic bi&s;hop of Whithern; which had no more till 1154. Melro&s;e remained in ruins till 1136, when re|founded by David I. The Chronicle of Melros was written in that, and next century; the part after Beda being a mere extract from Turgot, Florence of Worce&s;ter, the Saxon Chronicle, and other Engli&s;h writers; there being no Scoti&s;h hi&s;|torians to copy after, and the monks being Eng|li&s;h Ci&s;tertians from Reval, and &s;trangers to Scoti&s;h affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="324">Thus in the beginning of the ninth century, the Angles lo&s;t all ground in pre&s;ent Scotland. The population was Piki&s;h; and the Piks only recovered the dominion, not the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as fully &s;hewn before. The Angles who ruled in Northumbria, being the men at arms, were mo&s;tly cut off by the Danes; while the common inha|bitants remained: and there is room to que&s;tion if 10,000 real <HI>Angli</HI> were left in England, in the tenth century. It is remarkable that Engli&s;h writers of the twelfth century mention the <HI>Angli</HI> as barbarous<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Angli. et Scotti, et Picti, et caeteri barbari. <HI>Ricard.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> The Norwegians. Hi&s;tory of the Iles.</HEAD>
<P>A Great part of the Piki&s;h dominions was &s;eized by the Norwegians before the year 1056, a circum&s;tance which entitles them to a place in this work. The&s;e Norwegian acqui&s;i|tions con&s;i&s;ting of the Orkneys and part of the north of Pikland, and the Hebudes with part of the we&s;t, this &s;ection falls of cour&s;e into two arti|cles. But as our hi&s;torians, with their u&s;ual ig|norance, follow the dreams of Fordun, and &s;up|po&s;e both the Orkneys and Hebudes to have been only yielded to Magnus king of Norway, by Do|nald Ban in 1099, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h the fundamental facts in the fir&s;t place.</P>
<P>Concerning the ce&s;&s;ion of the Orkneys in 1099, even our own writers he&s;itate; and Buchanan re&s;tricts that ce&s;&s;ion to the <HI>in&s;uloe occidentales,</HI> 'we&s;tern iles,' or Hebudes. Simeon of Durham &s;ays, that in 1098 Magnus &s;eized the Orkneys. But this acqui&s;ition of Magnus is quite mi&s;un|der&s;tood by our writers. He did not make any conque&s;t from the Scots, but merely forced to his homage the Norwegian lords; who, more than two centuries before, had &s;eized on the Ork|neys and Hebudes, and a&s;&s;umed independency. This e&s;&s;ential fact is &s;o deeply rooted in Scandi|navian hi&s;tory, that the te&s;timony of &s;o late a writer as Fordun can never &s;hake it. Icelandic writers, from the eleventh century downward, afford &s;uch &s;imple and unbia&s;&s;ed evidence, that the Norwegians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Orkneys and He|budes,
<PB N="294" REF="326">from the time of Harold Harfagre, that to reject their credit, would be to violate every law of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> Torfaeus, a writer of the mo&s;t laudable indu&s;try, affords full illu&s;tration, in the thin folio volume he has publi&s;hed on their hi&s;tory. It is evident however that he has ante|dated the reign of Harold Harfagre about thirty years. For by his account Harold conquered the provincial kings of Norway, and a&s;&s;umed the &s;ole government in 875, yet reigned till 933, that is 58 years, be&s;ides his provincial reign! Tor|faeus was a very bad chronologer; and it is evident that Harold mu&s;t have become &s;ole king of Nor|way about, or after, the year 900. And by the Orkneyinga Saga, and other accounts, it was Harold Harfagre that &s;eized on the Orkneys and on the Hebudes, whereas Torfaeus dates this event in 880. But if it happend during the reign of Harold Harfagre, it could not take place till about 910. The Scandinavian chronology preceeding the year 900, when the real hi&s;tory of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, begins, is in|deed very fallacious; and the reigns of kings ridi|culou&s;ly extended.</P>
<P>But the Icelandic accounts bear that before Harold &s;ubdued the Orkneys and Hebudes, they had become receptables of Norwegian pirates, who had often ravaged his territories; and that he made expeditions again&s;t them in revenge. And from more certain records of Briti&s;h, Iri&s;h, and French hi&s;tory, it is well known that the Normans or Norwegians began, in the end of the eighth century, to ravage Ireland. In 801 they burned the church at Hyona; and 805 &s;lew many of the monks. In 838 they invaded Pik|land: and during that century often ravaged it. Particularly the reign of Con&s;tantin II. 864 to 882 was mo&s;t calamitous by their inva&s;ions, and almo&s;t total conque&s;t of the country; and it is
<PB N="295" REF="327">during this reign that i incline to fix the &s;ettle|ment of the Norwegians in the Orkneys and He|budes. But even from the beginning of that century, the&s;e iles were more in the Norwegian than in the Piki&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; being the fir&s;t re|ceptacles of tho&s;e pirates, who from them chiefly carried on their ravages into Ireland and Pikland. Even in 865 the Annals of Ul&s;ter mention Nor|wegians of Ireland and of <HI>Albain</HI> or Pikland; &s;o that they mu&s;t have held a part of Pikland by this time. And from this period the Hebudes are called <HI>Inch-Gall,</HI> or Iles of Foreigners, by Iri&s;h writers. Nor is there a &s;ingle hint in our frag|ments that the Orkneys, or the Hebudes, were at all &s;ubject to the kings of the united Piks and Dalriads, who had no fleet to attack the Scandi|navians; and could of cour&s;e neither defend tho&s;e ilands, nor re&s;ume them.</P>
<P>Such being the ca&s;e, we may &s;afely &s;ay that from 850, at lea&s;t, the Orkneys and Hebudes were held by Norwegian pirates, till about 910 when Harold Harfagre &s;ubdued them, and ap|pointed Earls; and a regular government and habitation followed. As after 900 the Scandi|navian hi&s;tory becomes clear and authentic, the names and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and many actions of the earls of Orkney, are perfectly pre&s;erved. And that the Hebudes al&s;o were po&s;&s;e&s;t by the Norwe|gians, by that time, if not before, is al&s;o authen|ticated from the mo&s;t ancient records of their hi&s;tory; while we have not one hint to &s;hew that they belonged to Pikland. It is needle&s;s there|fore to &s;ay that that our writers betray gro&s;s igno|rance when they imagine the Orkneys and He|budes to have belonged to Scotland, till 1099. They have only the te&s;timony of Fordun, a writer of the end of the fourteenth century; while again&s;t them are twenty or thirty writers preceding that time. The <HI>Chronicon Manniae</HI> is al&s;o clear again&s;t them, &s;eeing it begins with Godred king of Mann
<PB N="296" REF="328">and the Hebudes in 1066. The records of Mann are &s;aid to be &s;till pre&s;erved among the epi&s;copal archives at Drontheim in Norway. Mr. Sache|verel informs us that in 960 Guttred was king of Maun and the Hebudes: and after him Reginald, Olave, Olan, Fingal, then Godred 1060. But the expeditions of Harold Harfagre again&s;t the Norwegian pirates of Shetland, the Orkneys, and Hebudes; and his e&s;tabli&s;hment of regular go|vernment in the two later, are confirmed by the whole of Scandinavian hi&s;tory. Among a cloud of other authorities are Thiodolf the Scald or Poet of Harold Harfagre, who&s;e ver&s;es are pre&s;erved by Snorro; Snorro, who gives a particular ac|count of the&s;e expeditions; the Landnama book of Iceland, which contains the names and fami|lies of many Norwegians, who went from the Hebudes to &s;ettle in Iceland, in the tenth century; the <HI>Codex Flateyen&s;is,</HI> one of the mo&s;t ancient and authentic records of Scandinavian hi&s;tory; the Orkneying a Saga; Niaga Saga: and the other Icelandic monuments. Aimoinus and Robertus de Monte, two ancient foreign writers quoted by Torfaeus, avouch that the Orkneys, and north of Scotland and the Hebudes, were &s;ubjected to Norway<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">So Torfaeus a&s;&s;erts, p. 9, but i cannot find the pa&s;&s;ages, and believe them imaginary.</NOTE>, before the time of Harold Harfagre.</P>
<P>Such being the ca&s;e, it is believed no doubt can remain on this radical fact, of the early &s;ub|jection of the Orkneys and Hebudes to the Nor|wegians: and a few hints &s;hall now be given on the hi&s;tory of the&s;e iles. The reader has already &s;een that the idea he is to form of the Orkneys, during this period, is that of a Norwegian Earl|dom; and of the Hebudes, that of a Norwegian Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD><HI>1.</HI> The Orkneys.</HEAD>
<P>The Piks, in their progre&s;s from Scandina|via, &s;eem to have entirely neglected the Orkneys, as Solinus, who wrote about the year 240, &s;ays they were de&s;ert in his time. The very name is according to Torfaeus derived from <HI>Ork,</HI> a de|&s;ert. But after the Piki&s;h tribes were united into one monarchy, and exten&s;ive power, about the year 400, the Orkneys were peopled by them. This appears from an authentic record of Tho|mas bi&s;hop of the Orkneys, dated 1403<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Publi&s;hed in Wallace's Orkneys, edit. 1700; and from that book in the Orkneyinga Saga.</NOTE>, in which we are told, that when the Norwegians conquered the Orkneys, they found them po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed, <HI>duabus nationibus, &s;cilicet Peti et Pape,</HI> 'by two nations the Pets and Papas.' The fir&s;t of the&s;e nations was palpably the Piks, called Pets by the Scandinavians, as Saxo's <HI>Petia,</HI> or Pik|land, and the name <HI>Petland fiord</HI> for Pikland frith, in Icelandic writings, may witne&s;s. The Papas, by the u&s;ual confu&s;ion of long tradition here called a nation, were clearly the Iri&s;h papas or prie&s;ts, long the &s;ole clergy in the Piki&s;h do|mains; and who, &s;peaking a different language from the Piks, were by the Norwegian &s;ettlers, regarded not as a di&s;tinct profe&s;&s;ion only, but as remains of a different nation. Thus Arius Frodi<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">De I&s;landia, p. 11, edit. Havniae, 1733, 410. See al&s;o Theodoricus monachus de reb. Norv. p. 8.</NOTE>, who wrote about 1070, tells us that the Norwe|gians, who colonized Iceland, found there Iri&s;h <HI>papas,</HI> who were driven out, but left their Iri&s;h books, <HI>baecr Ir&s;car,</HI> behind them. <HI>Papey,</HI> one of the Orkneys, in all likelihood, derives its name from being a chief re&s;idence of the Papas.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="330">Wallace al&s;o tells, that by Orcadian tradition, the <HI>Pechts</HI> were the fir&s;t inhabitants; and many circular buildings in the Orkneys are called Pechts Hou&s;es. Tho&s;e Piks who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Orkneys, from remote and di&s;tinct &s;ituation, u&s;ed to &s;et up kinglets of their own, and affect independency. About 590, as appears from Adomnan's life of Columba, there was a <HI>regulus Orcadum,</HI> or king|let of the Orkneys, at the re&s;idence of Brudi II. the Piki&s;h king. In 681 the Orkneys having again rebelled, were wa&s;ted by Brudi IV. as we learn from Tighernach and the Annals of Ul&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the ninth century they were &s;eized by Nor|wegian pirates, as above explained. About 910 Harold Harfagre, king of Norway, irritated by the incur&s;ions of tho&s;e pirates on his kingdom, proceeded again&s;t them; and &s;ubduing them, ap|pointed earls, and regular government in the Orkneys. Harold offered Rognwald the earldom, but that chief was in &s;uch favour with the king, and &s;o extremely opulent in great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Norway, that he entreated Harold to give the inve&s;titure to Sigurd his brother, which was done. This Sigurd the fir&s;t earl is called Ey&s;tein|&s;on, or the Elder, to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the &s;e|cond Sigurd, &s;urnamed the Gro&s;s, who fell at Clontarf 1014. The Orcadian hi&s;tory after this may be found in Torfaeus; and it is &s;ufficiently clear and exact, if we except the fable of a <HI>Kalius,</HI> king of Scotland, at the time Duncan reigned there. But this one fable, grounded on old bal|lads only, does not injure the re&s;t; for if we reject ancient hi&s;tory, becau&s;e one or two fables have crept in, what hi&s;tory could &s;tand? A li&s;t of the earls of Orkney may be found in our Appendix. It &s;hall only be ob&s;erved here, that the Norwegi|ans in the Orkneys were converted to Chri&s;tianity about 980. That the Norwegian earls continued till about 1330, when they failed in the per&s;on of
<PB N="299" REF="331">Magnus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sutherland was taken from the earls of Orkney by Alex|ander king of Scotland, <HI>Charta</HI> 1403, <HI>&s;upra citat.</HI> &s;urely Alex. l. 1107, for in the reign of William there were Scoti&s;h earls of Sutherland.</NOTE>: and the Orkneys and Caithne&s;s fell to Malis earl of Strathern, the next heir. Malis had two daughters, one married to Weland de Ard who had Caithne&s;s, and their &s;on Alexander de Ard &s;old that county to Robert II. king of Scotland. The other was married to William Sinclair, lord Sinclair, in who&s;e family the Ork|neys long remained. Malcom II. gave Thorfin 1030&mdash;1064 inve&s;titure of the Orkneys. But in 1098 Magnus Barefoot king of Norway, accord|ing to Simeon of Durham, conquered the Ork|neys. And Icelandic accounts bear, that he de|po&s;ed the earls Paul and Erland, and gave the Orkneys to his own &s;on Sigurd. But in 1103 Magnus being &s;lain in Ireland, Sigurd went to Norway to a&s;&s;ume the kingdom; and Magnus, &s;on of Erland the late Earl, came from Scotland, and became Earl. After which there is no hint that the Earls were &s;ubject to Norway; but they were independent. In 1320 Magnus earl of Ork|ney &s;igns the famous letter to the Pope, along with the other Scoti&s;h peers.</P>
<P>This earldom, be&s;ides the Orkneys, comprized a great part of the north of Scotland. The Norwegian accounts exaggerate in their own fa|vour, as u&s;ual in all countries. Sigurd the fir&s;t earl, 920, is &s;aid to have &s;ubdued Caithne&s;s, Sutherland, Ro&s;s, and Moray. It &s;eems certain however that the <HI>Moravien&s;es</HI> were the furthe&s;t people, on the north-ea&s;t, who acknowleged the Scoti&s;h king; and even they were often in arms again&s;t him. Thus the Norwegians held all down to Murray Frith on the ea&s;t. On the we&s;t they &s;eem to have held all pre&s;ent Ro&s;s-&s;hire. Caithne&s;s and Sutherland belonged to the earl|dom of Orkney, as all grant: and Sutherland
<PB N="300" REF="332">took its name from its &s;outhern &s;ituation in re|&s;pect to Caithne&s;s and the Orkneys. As to Ro&s;s, it can only be &s;aid that the Icelandic accounts bear, that it belonged to that earldom, but that the <HI>De&s;criptio Albaniae</HI> regards Ro&s;s and Moray as belonging to Scotland. Ro&s;s is however &s;o moun|tainous and barren a di&s;trict, that it &s;eems to have been neglected by all parties, and left to the Wild Iri&s;h of Argyle: and it was generally a province of the Hebudian kingdom<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Earl of Ro&s;s and Lord of the Iles were commonly united titles. In 1461 John bears them in a treaty with Edward IV, of England. Till James V. circumnavigated the iles, and re|duced them to order, they can hardly be regarded as &s;ubject to Scotland.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Shetland iles mu&s;t al&s;o not be forgotten. They are called <HI>Hialt-land</HI> in Norwegian, &s;ignify|ing the land of <HI>Hialt</HI> (a man's name).

Of the Shetland iles we find little account in the Icelandic writers; tho from them Torfaeus has drawn a complete hi&s;tory of the more di&s;tant Fareys; which, as a picture of barbaric &s;ociety, is a curious piece. The Shetland iles were &s;ub|ject to the earls of Orkney, as we learn from Tor&s;aeus.</P>

<HEAD><HI>2.</HI> The Hebudes.</HEAD>
<P>There is no &s;pecial hi&s;tory of the Hebudes in Icelandic, as there is of the Orkneys; and their hi&s;tory is of cour&s;e more ob&s;cure.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="333">Our writers are &s;o ignorant concerning them, that they have even, for more than two centuries, perverted the very name in an odd manner. For &s;ince the publication of the notorious Hi&s;tory of Hector Boethius at Paris, 1526, folio, our writers have called the&s;e iles <HI>Hebrides.</HI> I have taken &s;ome pains to detect the origin of this blunder.

However i chanced upon an edition of Solinus, in which the very &s;ource of this error appeared. Its title is, <HI>Solinus de Memorabilibus Mundi, diligenter annotatus et indicio alphabetico prenotatus.</HI> In a wooden print is the name of the book&s;eller Denis Roce, Pari&s;iis: and on the back of the title is a dedication by Badius A&s;cen&s;ius the printer to <HI>John De Falce,</HI> dated <HI>ad idus Julias,</HI> M.

Such being the ca&s;e, and the name <HI>Hebrides</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Late Iri&s;h writers &s;ay that the Hebrides are &s;o called from king Hiber.</NOTE> a mere blunder, the con|dition of learning, and of antiquarian &s;tudies in particular, among us of Scotland, may be more ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed at from this &s;imple circum&s;tance, than from any argument.

<P>In the hi&s;tory of the&s;e iles, the Piki&s;h kingdom fir&s;t appears, which began there; as from them the Piks fir&s;t &s;pread over Scotland, as fully &s;hewn above. Solinus de&s;cribes the &s;tate of this king|dom, about the year 240 when he wrote. In 565 the Hebudes &s;till belonged to the Piks; for in that year Brudi gave Hyona to Columba, as Beda tells. Adomnan, in his life of Columba, gives &s;ome hints as to their then &s;tate. But the He|budes &s;eem to have been left almo&s;t de&s;ert, when the Piks gained Valentia, and other fertile po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions on the &s;outh: and we find not that Columba tried to convert their inhabitants. Nor in Iri&s;h hi&s;tory or &s;anctology is any of the&s;e ilands men|tioned, (except Hyona) as the &s;cene of any action whatever. Their &s;ubjection to the petty kings of
<PB N="303" REF="335">Mann is another proof of their being almo&s;t un-peopled. Upon the&s;e grounds i am convinced that after the Piks began to move &s;outh, the He|budes were left almo&s;t de&s;ert. Nay that the Nor|wegians who &s;ettled in them mu&s;t have been few, el&s;e they would not have &s;ubmitted to the petty kings of Mann, but have had &s;eparate earls or kings. In 1266 the Hebudes were ceded to Scot|land; and as no inhabitants could leave the conti|nent for &s;uch rude and remote habitations, crouds of wild Iri&s;h were permitted, if not invited, to &s;ettle among the Norwegians, who remained. For as the Iri&s;h dete&s;ted the Engli&s;h yoke, &s;o they were ever on good terms with the Scoti&s;h kings; owing to the inrercour&s;e, and &s;amene&s;s of language, between them and our Dalriads. That this was the ca&s;e, appears from the peculiar fre&s;hne&s;s of their Iri&s;h origin to be traditionally found among tho&s;e ilanders at pre&s;ent; and from their language being more perfectly Iri&s;h than that of our high|landers; as well as from the evidence of hi&s;toric facts. The chief families are however Norwegi|ans, who remained as principal tenants: and the people have more of the Norwegian largene&s;s of limbs, and redne&s;s of hair, than our highlanders. But our kings hardly regarded them, or the high|landers, as &s;ubjects: and in the grand conte&s;t with Edward I. both traitorou&s;ly allied them&s;elves with the enemy. Hence they, as well as the high|landers, are unknown in Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory; nor are once mentioned, &s;ave in a&s;&s;rays and crimes.</P>
<P>About 912 Ketil was made lord of the Hebudes by Harold Harfagre, and u&s;urped independency. <HI>Torf. Orc.</HI> I. 5. Perhaps the kings of Mann de|&s;cended from him. In 989 Godfrey, &s;on of Ha|rold, king of the Hebudes, was &s;lain by the Dal|riads. <HI>Tigh. Ann. Ult.</HI> About 1012 Gill, an earl of the Hebudes, is mentioned. <HI>Torf.</HI> I. 11.

<P>The Ile of Maun attracts particular notice, as the &s;eat of this kingdom.

But in the ninth century Maun was &s;eized by the Norwegian pirates; who held it till Harold Harfagre, about 910 expelled them. It is clear, from their &s;peech, that the in|habitants came chiefly from Ireland: and it is likely that the kings of the Hebudes were Nor|wegians from Ireland, then over-run with Scandi|navians. In 1075 we find the people of Maun &s;ending to the king of Dublin, to de&s;ire him to appoint a king of Maun<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. Mann. apud Camden.</NOTE>.

<P>Ye knowing men of Alba, ye comely ho&s;ts of the yellow tre&s;&s;es, know ye the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of that country?</P>
<P>Albanus of the numerous combatants was the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. He was the &s;on of I&s;iacon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hi&s;icion of Nennius, cap. 12, 13. Eccard in his <HI>Orig. Germ.</HI> thinks the Hi&s;icion of Nennius Tui&s;co the father of the Germans; and his Armenon, Arminius.</NOTE>. From him is derived the name of Alba. Britus was his brother. Britus bani&s;hed his brother acro&s;s the Ictian &s;ea. Bri|tus &s;eized upon Alba, to the limits of the hunter Fo|thadan.</P>
<P>Long after the celebrated Britus the Nemedians &s;ettled here, under au&s;pices of Erglan. It was after the &s;iege of Tor Conang.</P>
<P>In a latter period Cruthnidh, (pronounc&egrave; Crunii) i. e. the Picts, &s;eized upon Alba, after quitting Ireland. Seventy of their monarchs reigned over Cruthenland (North Britain), from Cathluan to the valiant Con|&s;tantin.</P>
<P>After that period the de&s;cendants of Conary the mild, (king of Ireland, A. D. 220) &s;ettled in that country. And in later time the grand&s;ons of Achay, (&s;urnamed Munrevar,) enlarged their borders after a &s;ignal victory. They were the three &s;ons of Erk; Loarn, Fergus, and Angus, who obtained the bene|diction of St. Patrick. Memorable were tho&s;e victo|rious Gaedhils, (pronounced Ga&euml;ils.)</P>
<P>Loarn, of the &s;hining countenance, ruled 10 years over the we&s;t of Alba. After him Fergus 27 years. Domangard &s;on of Fergus 4 years, in turbulence. Comgal his brother 24 years in peace. Gauran &s;on of Domangard reigned 2 years, without reproach. Conal, &s;on of Comgal 15 years. Aedan, of the ex|tended territories, reigned 24 years. Achay the yellow, or &s;warthy, 17 years. Concad Kerr (the &s;ilent) three months; and Ferchar his &s;on 16 years. Domnald &s;ur|named Breac, or the &s;peckled, 14 years. Conal and
<PB N="328" REF="363">Dongal jointly 10 years. Domnald Duin 13 years. Malduin &s;on of Conal 17 years. Ferchar Fada (the tall) 21 years. Achay the valiant 2 years. Anbkel|lach &s;on of Ferchar 1 year. Muriach 3 years. Aodh 30. Domhnald 24. Conal 2: and another Conal 4. Con&s;tantin the good 9. Angus 9. Aod 4. Eoganan 13. Dungal 7. Alpin 4.</P>
<P>KENETH the hardy 30 years. Domnald the ruddy complexioned 4. The hero Con&s;tantin 30. Aodh the fairhaired, Con&s;tantin's brother, 2. Domnald &s;on of Con&s;tantin 5. Con&s;tantin &s;on of Aodh 46. Malcolm 4. Indolph 8. Dubhoda 7. Culen 4. Keneth &s;on of Malcolm 27. Con&s;tantin 7. Macduff 4. Malcolm 30. Donchad 6. The &s;on of Finlauch (Macbeth) 17. Lulach, 7 months.</P>
<P>Malcolm, &s;on of Donchad, is the pre&s;ent king. God alone knows how long he is to reign.</P>
<P>To the pre&s;ent time, of the &s;on of Donchad the lively faced, 52 kings of the race of Erk have reigned over Alba, (or Albany.)</P>

<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>Of the Nemedians, and the &s;iege of Tor-Conang, (a &s;trong place on Tiry i&s;land, in the county of Dona|gall,) an account, mo&s;tly fabulous, is given in the Iri&s;h book of Inva&s;ions. A more credible account is there given of the &s;ettlement of the Cruthnii, or Picts, in North Britain, &s;ome ages before the Chri&s;tian aera.</P>
<P>Conary the mild, king of Ireland, A. D. 220, was a prince of the part of Mun&s;ter now called the county of Kerry. He left three &s;ons. The elde&s;t Carbry Riada, or the long-armed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted his cou&s;in-german, Cormac king of Ireland, in his inva&s;ion of North Britain: and, on concluding a treaty with the Picts, the Iri&s;h mo|narch obtained in that country a &s;ettlement for Carbry Riada, his cou&s;in, about the year 260.</P>
<P>The defects and derangements in the Duan are only vi&s;ible from the year 719 to 895. The lo&s;s of a genuine copy of the whole is to be regretted. Thus far Mr. O'Conor.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="364">Only one ancient copy of this poem has yet been found; from which a number of modern copies have been made. Mr. O'Flaherty's copy was equally defec|tive with Mr. O'Conor's. After Anbkellach, Dungal and Alpin were in&s;erted by tran&s;po&s;ition; and Mr. O'Conor thinks the poem corrupted and moderni&s;ed after that time. But a gentleman, well ver&s;ed in the Iri&s;h, informs me that it &s;eems all equally ancient, and by one hand; &s;o that there is room to &s;u&s;pect many of the errors to be mi&s;takes of the bard who compo&s;ed it.</P>
<P>This poem is quoted in the la&s;t century by Ward in his <HI>Vita Rumoldi,</HI> p. 372; by Colgan in his <HI>Trias Thau|maturga,</HI> p. 115; and by O'Flaherty often in his <HI>Ogygia.</HI> Sir George Mackenzie refers to it, p. 150, of his De|fence of the Antiquity of the Royal line. A copy of it is &s;aid to be in the P&s;alter of Ca&s;hel, now mi&s;&s;ing, but thought to be in the Iri&s;h college at Paris.</P>

<HEAD><HI>NUMBER IV.</HI> Kings of Norway.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of Norway has had a &s;ingular fate; for while in that of Denmark, and Sweden; writers and materials are wanting, till a late period, the Norwegian, on the contrary, labours under an exce&s;s of materials; owing to the number of I celandic Sagas, chiefly relating to Norway, the parent country of Ice|land. Snorro's hi&s;tory, in particular, is merely that of Norway; tho his fir&s;t book contains the Swedi&s;h kings, down to the conque&s;t of Sweden by Ivar Vidfatme king of Denmark, about the year 760; becau&s;e tho&s;e princes, who gained the command of all Norway, were de&s;cended from the Swedi&s;h race. The work of Snorro is very prolix, and full of private anecdotes; being, like the other Sagas, Memoirs, and not Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Twenty, or more, petty monarchies prevailed in Norway, till the ninth century. About the year 760 Ingiald, king of Sweden, was vanqui&s;hed by Ivar king of Denmark. Olaf, &s;on of Ingiald, retired to the north|we&s;t of Sweden; and founded a kingdom. His &s;on Halfdan Whitbein, by the help of many Swedi&s;h re|fugees, &s;ubdued a great part of the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Nor|way, about pre&s;ent Chri&s;tiana. To him &s;ucceeded Ey&s;tein, his &s;on, king of the &s;aid part of Norway, an|ciently called Raumarik and We&s;tfold. His &s;on was Halfdan; and Halfdan's &s;on Gudreyd; next Olaf &s;on of Gudreyd, and Ragnvald &s;on of Olaf; all &s;ucce&s;&s;ive kings of the &s;ame territory. Then followed Halfdan Swart brother of Olaf, and &s;on of Gudreyd, with whom the real hi&s;tory of Norway dawns. It is remarkable that Snorro, who gives the above account, makes every king father and &s;on, till the real hi&s;tory begins; when no &s;uch &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is found, but various contingencies happen. Now as it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be regular in a barbaric kingdom, and irregular as it became civilized, Snorro's genealogies are certainly fal&s;e, till the real hi&s;tory dawns. The names may be
<PB N="338" REF="373">real: but that every king &s;ucceeded his father is ficti|tious in it&s;elf; and incon&s;i&s;tent with all real accounts of the barbaric government of the Goths.</P>
<P>About 870 Halfdan Swart, king of We&s;tfold and Raumarik, &s;ubdued two or three other petty kingdoms.</P>
<P>About 900 HARALD I. <HI>Harfagre</HI> &s;ucceeded his fa|ther Halfdan Swart: and about 910 conquering the &s;everal petty kingdoms, became ma&s;ter of all Norway. He died in 936.</P>
<P N="936">936. <HI>Eric l. Blodox,</HI> a &s;on of Harald, attempted to &s;eize the kingdom; but was forced to retire to England.</P>
<P N="937">937. HAKON I. the Good, a &s;on of Harald, who had been educated in England by king A thel&s;tan, was cho|&s;en king. He was a Chri&s;tian, but could not convert his &s;ubjects; and was &s;lain in 963, after reigning 26 years.</P>
<P N="963">963. HARALD II. <HI>Grafeld,</HI> &s;on of Eric Blodox, and his brothers, got the &s;overeignty. But <HI>Hakon,</HI> a power|ful earl, held Drontheim, the province in which the capital ftood, &s;ince Norway became one kingdom. In 970 earl Hakon was forced to fly to Denmark. King Harald was &s;lain in 977.</P>
<P N="978">978. <HI>Hakon</HI> was made EARL of Norway by the Da|ni&s;h king, upon homage. This earldom la&s;ted till 996, when Hakon was &s;lain.</P>
<P N="996">996. OLAF I. <HI>Trygva&s;on,</HI> a de&s;cendant of Harald Harfagre, coming from Ireland, a&s;&s;umed the kingdom. Tho he reigned only four years, he is much celebrated by northern hi&s;tory. He was certainly a great prince; and with much courage and conduct forced his whole &s;ubjects to become Chri&s;tians. Iceland was al&s;o con|verted; and Vinland a part of North America di&s;co|vered; during this &s;hort, but glorious reign. He was killed in a &s;ea &s;ight, again&s;t the kings of Denmark and Sweden, in the year 1000.</P>
<P N="1000">1000. Norway was partly &s;ubject to Denmark and Sweden; partly to earl <HI>Eric,</HI> &s;on of earl Hakon. In 1012 earl Eric went to England.</P>
<P N="1014">1014. OLAF II. the Saint, a relation of Olaf Tryg|va&s;on, coming from England a&s;&s;umed the &s;cepter of Norway. This &s;aint was of the church militant, for his long reign is full of incidents, and enterprize; and occupies a fourth part of Snorro's work. Olaf was &s;lain fighting again&s;t the Danes, Augu&s;t 1030. He is the patron &s;aint of Norway.</P>
<P N="1030"><PB N="339" REF="374">1030. <HI>Swein,</HI> &s;on of Canute the great, king of Eng|land and Denmark, ruled Norway till 1035; when he fled to Hardaknut his brother in Denmark.</P>
<P N="1035">1035. MAGNUS I. the GOOD, &s;on of Olaf the &s;aint, was cho&s;en king of Norway. Having agreed with Har|daknut, king of Denmark, that he who &s;urvived &s;hould inherit the dominions of the other, in 1041 Magnus the good became KING OF NORWAY AND DENMARK. He died in 1047: and Swein, a de&s;cendant of Canute the Great, acquired the crown of Denmark.</P>
<P N="1047">1047. HARALD III. <HI>Hardrad,</HI> brother of Olaf the Saint, became king of Norway. After reigning 19 years, he was &s;lain in a battle again&s;t Harold king of England, 25 Sept. 1066.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hi&s;tory of Norway being little known, the author was in|duced to continue the &s;eries to the end.</NOTE></P>
<P N="1067">1067. OLAF III. <HI>Kyrre,</HI> or the Peaceable, &s;on of Harald Hardrad, began his reign. In 1069 he founded Biorgen or Bergen; and built a &s;tone church there; and improved the old wooden one. In 1077 he built a &s;tone church at Nidaros, now Drontheim, and placed the relics of St. Olaf in it. He died 22 Sept. 1093, after a happy reign of 26 years.</P>
<P N="1093">1093. MAGNUS II. <HI>Baerfetta,</HI> &s;on of Olaf Kyrre be|came king. <HI>Hakon</HI> was however cho&s;en king of part of Norway, but died in 1095. In 1098 Magnus under|took his famous expedition to the Orkneys, and He|budes, which he &s;ubdued. In 1102 he went on another expedition: and was &s;lain in Ireland in 1103.</P>
<P N="1103">1103. SIGURD I. <HI>Jor&s;alafar,</HI> EYSTEIN, and OLAF, the three &s;ons of Magnus Baerfetta, reign together. Si|gurd is famed for his expedition into the Mediterranean, and valiant actions in di&s;tant realms, 1107&mdash;1111. In 1116 Olaf died. Ey&s;tein in 1123. Sigurd in 1130.</P>
<P N="1130">1130. MAGNUS III. <HI>Blinda,</HI> &s;on of Sigurd, became king of Norway. But half of the kingdom was a&s;&s;igned to <HI>Harald Gil,</HI> &s;on of Magnus Baerfetta. In 1134 Ha|rald is defeated by Magnus; but returning with a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from Denmark, he takes Magnus captive, ca&s;trates him, and puts out his eyes.</P>
<P N="1135">1135. HARALD IV. <HI>Gil,</HI> reigned one year; and was &s;lain in a con&s;piracy.</P>
<P N="1136">1136. SIGURD II. and INGI I. &s;ons of Harald Gil, are made kings. In 1142 EYSTEIN, another &s;on of Harald Gil, coming from Scotland is al&s;o made king
<PB N="340" REF="375">with his brothers. In 1153 Ey&s;tein ravaged the ea&s;tern &s;hores of Scotland and England, burned Aberdeen, &amp;c. Drontheim or Nidaros was, in 1152, made an archie|pi&s;copal &s;ee by the Pope. In 1155 Sigurd was &s;lain, in a battle with Ingi his brother. Ey&s;tein fell in 1157; and HAKON was cho&s;en in his &s;tead. Ingi was &s;lain in 1161.</P>
<P N="1161">1161. HAKON II. <HI>Herdabreid,</HI> &s;on of Sigurd, be|comes king of Norway: &s;lain in 1162.</P>
<P N="1162">1162. MAGNUS IV. &s;on of Erling an earl, was cho|&s;en king. <HI>Sigurd,</HI> &s;on of Sigurd, reigned over a province or two. In 1175 the famous faction of the Birkabeins appeared in Vika, or the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Norway; and continued long to give, and take away, the royalty. In 1176 they made <HI>Ey&s;tein,</HI> &s;on of Ey&s;tein, king: who being &s;lain in 1177, they appointed SVERIR in his &s;tead.</P>

<P N="1263">1263. MAGNUS V. &s;on of Hakon, had been de|clared king in 1259, four years before his father's death. His virtues equalled his father's. He cultivated peace, and reformed the laws; whence he was called <HI>Lagebetter,</HI> He died 1280, after reigning 21 years.</P>

<P>IT may &s;afely be denied that even the fabulous part of Dani&s;h, Swedi&s;h, or Norwegian hi&s;tory, can be carried to an earlier date, than the year 500 after Chri&s;t. The number of kings, of whom (according to the &s;ounde&s;t principles of chronology), not more than ten years, at a medium, can be a&s;&s;igned to each; in&s;tead of thirty, or a generation, as ab&s;urdly put by the northern antiquaries; &s;erves to a&s;certain this epoch. The Sla|vonic nations of Poland and Ru&s;&s;ia, who had writers rather before the Scandinavian kingdoms, are yet con|tented to begin even their &s;abulous hi&s;tory in the &s;e|venth and eighth centuries. In dige&s;ting this &s;eries of Dani&s;h kings, Torfaeus is followed, as to the names, preceding the ninth century; his arguments again&s;t Saxo, concerning that period, being conclu&s;ive. But that part is &s;abulous, not hi&s;torical: and when Torfaeus comes to the ninth century, he errs by &s;uppo&s;ing that his I&s;landic &s;agas, of &s;ufficiently fabulous faith to check the fables of Saxo, could be &s;et again&s;t Eginhart, Adam of Bremen, and others, who wrote centuries before any of the&s;e I&s;landic Sagas were imagined. Adam of Bre|men given the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of many Dani&s;h and Swedi&s;h kings, of the ninth and tenth centuries: and his autho|rity is here followed, as a far nearer writer, both in time and place, than tho&s;e Sagas; which being written in Iceland, &s;hew a peculiar ignorance concerning Den|mark, the mo&s;t &s;outherly of the Scandinavian king|doms. As Adam is confe&s;&s;edly right in his account of Swedi&s;h kings, he is certainly &s;o in that of the Dani&s;h; nor is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that he took kings of Jutland for tho&s;e of Denmark, as &s;ome Dani&s;h antiquaries dream; for he di&s;tingui&s;hes Jutland by its own name, or by that of <HI>Dania Ci&s;marina,</HI> as di&s;tinct from Denmark, or Sealand, who&s;e kings he mentions. And as he precedes Saxo by a whole century, and the I&s;landic &s;agas by two, and had his accounts from Swein II. king of Denmark him&s;elf; he de&s;erves more faith, by every rule of hi&s;|toric authority, than any later writer.</P>

<P>A DISSERTATION ON THE ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF THE SCYTHIANS OR GOTHS.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>BEING occupied with a mo&s;t laborious re&s;earch into the hi&s;tory of Scotland, preceding the year 1056, the author found it incontrovertibly &s;ettled from Tacitus, Beda, and the whole ancient accounts, that the <HI>Caledonii</HI> or <HI>Picti,</HI> the ancient and &s;till chief inhabitants of that country, came to it from German Scythia, or Scandinavia. This led him to enquire how the Scythians came to give their name even to the mo&s;t northern parts of Ger|many, from the earlie&s;t days of Grecian literature, down to a very late period. He found that the fir&s;t Greek authors had certain knowlege that the Scythians had proceeded from Little, or Ancient, Scythia on the Euxine, even to the extremity of Germany, peopling the whole intervening country; and that the Latin cla&s;&s;ics had the &s;ame knowlege. But that the rea&s;on why I&s;idorus, Beda, Paulus Diaconus, the Geographer of Ravenna, and in|numerable writers of the middle ages, call Scan|dinavia peculiarly Scythia, was that Jornandes, who wrote about 530, had imagined that the mo&s;t ancient Scythians proceeded from it about 4000 years before Chri&s;t. Hence, in the darkne&s;s of the middle ages, Scandinavia was regarded as the true Scythia, or Scythia Antiqua.</P>
<PB N="iii" REF="423">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<P><PB N="iv" REF="424">As the author was re&s;olved, if a Spani&s;h proverb may be u&s;ed, to <HI>leave nothing in the inkhorn,</HI> knowing that, without going to the very bottom of a &s;ubject like this, no point of it can be clear, he began a cour&s;e of reading all the authors that could anywi&s;e illu&s;trate the early population of Europe. Proceeding chronologically thro the Greek and Roman writers, and the mo&s;t important ones of the middle ages, he re&s;erved modern authors to the la&s;t, that they might mini&s;ter no matter of prejudice; for truth can only be had pure in it's fountains. 'This great labour, as indexes were never con&s;ulted, &s;ave in moral authors, as Ari&s;totle, Plato, &amp;c. or others who could have almo&s;t no|thing on the &s;ubject, con&s;umed more than a year tho eight hours a day were almo&s;t con&s;tantly alloted to it; and &s;uch clo&s;e attention goes a great way in a little time. After this cour&s;e of ancient reading he proceeded to the moderns, and found him&s;elf in quite a new world indeed! For a &s;ubject, &s;o capa|ble of &s;uperabundant illu&s;tration from the multi|tude of authorities, if indu&s;try alone, with &s;ome degree of clear judgement, be applied, has been totally lo&s;t in a ma&s;s of &s;uperficiality and error. For error is the con&s;tant, and inevitable, produce of &s;uperficiality. The truth is always at the bot|tom; and if a man does not know all upon an an|tiquarian &s;ubject, he knows nothing: nay le&s;s than nothing, ina&s;much as error is wor&s;e than ignorance. When all is redd upon &s;uch a theme, it is al&s;o a great plea&s;ure to reflect that the truth mu&s;t be known; for ancient authoritics are facts in hi&s;tory,
<PB N="v" REF="425">and incontrovertible: one may be oppo&s;ed to another; but when all concur, for any modern to oppo&s;e is in utter frenzy to da&s;h his head again&s;t the wall of a ca&s;tle. After reading all upon &s;uch a &s;ubject one is therefore thoroughly ma&s;ter of it; and no information can remain that can infringe the ab&s;olute knowledge acquired. Antiquarian re|&s;earches, when complete, are infallible; for no new facts can occur in antiquity. To talk of opinion, upon &s;uch &s;ubjects, is to talk as a child; for opinion can never alter facts: a man may opine that &s;now is black, or that a Scythian is a Celt; but he will be left to his delu&s;ion, while the facts remain to eternity.</P>
<P>Perhaps a more arduous ta&s;k never was under|taken than what is here &s;ubmitted to the reader. The materials collected would have compo&s;ed a va&s;t volume; but this was foreign to the author's intention. The toil of compre&s;&s;ing was far more great, than that of dilating would have been. A va&s;t volume might have been written in half the time employed in the&s;e few pages. But great ad|vantages attend the progre&s;s of &s;cience, from con|centrating into one &s;trong focus a number of &s;cat|tered beams. Error is melted by the fierce light; and vani&s;hes beneath it's power. Would to heaven we had fewer large books, and more &s;mall ones! No greater advantage could ari&s;e to &s;cience, than if authors would follow the example of Tacitus, who, as Monte&s;quieu well ob&s;erves, ABRIDGED ALL BECAUSE HE SAW ALL.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="426">The learned have on no &s;ubject fallen into &s;o numerous, and gro&s;s, errors as with regard to the Scythians. They have been confounded with the Celts, tho all the ancient writers oppo&s;e this; and di&s;tingui&s;h no two races of men more widely than Scythians and Celts. They have been taken for Sarmatians, tho all the ancients al&s;o oppo&s;e this; and, from the days of Herodotus, e&s;pecially di|&s;tingui&s;h the Scythians from the Sarmatians. They have been, by late authors of the fir&s;t fame, con|founded with Tartars, an error of all others the mo&s;t ridiculous: for the Tartars were ab&s;olutely unknown to the ancients, till the Huns, who were indeed &s;trictly &s;peaking Monguls not Tartars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The name <HI>Tartar,</HI> as vague with us as Indian, is in fact of &s;mall extent. It is not more ancient than the 12th cen|turry; and was originally that of a &s;mall nation conquered by the Monguls under Zenghizcan; but by a caprice u&s;ual in names is given by us to almo&s;t half of A&s;ia! The U&s;beks are now the chief Tartar nation. The Kalmucs are not Tartars, but Monguls, a va&s;t people of a different language. The Turks are of the &s;ame race with the Huns; Monguls, not Tartars, according to De Guignes. The Tungu&s;ians, another va&s;t people, are quite di&s;tinct from the Tartars. On the ea&s;t of the Lena the nations are from America, and differ from all the other A&s;iatics, as the rev. Mr. Tooke &s;hews in his <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> See <HI>De Guignes Hi&s;t. des Huns; Tooke's Ru&s;&s;ia; D' Anville, Geographic,</HI> &amp;c.</P></NOTE>, appeared and &s;eized on the countries of the ea&s;tern Scythae. The&s;e points are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in this e&s;&s;ay.

<PB N="vii" REF="427">Scythians were neither Celts, Sarmatians, nor Tartars, no more than a hor&s;e is an elephant, a lion or a tiger, but a hor&s;e; &s;o the Scythians were Scythians, a di&s;tinct, peculiar, and marked people, fir&s;t called Scythians by the Greeks, who retained that name for them till the de&s;truction of Con&s;tantinople in the 15th century; while the Latins, upon forming a di&s;agreeable acquaintance with them, called them Goths, as they al&s;o called them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Now, tho almo&s;t all Europe be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the de&s;cendents of the Goths, a people from whom, as &s;hall be &s;hewn, the Greeks and Romans al&s;o &s;prung; and the Goths tran&s;cended, even when barbarians, all nations in wi&s;dom and war: yet &s;uch is our ignorance, who are at pre&s;ent but &s;lowly eloping from barbari&s;m, that the name of Goth, the &s;acred name of our fathers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Count du Buat forcibly expre&s;&s;es this in his fir&s;t &s;entence, 'Les anciens peuples de l'Europe que nous appellons Barbares et qui &s;ont nos Peres.' <HI>Hi&s;t.

This &s;chool-boy idea prevails to this hour in the fir&s;t writers; &s;o true is the remark of Dryden,
<Q>Men are but children of a larger growth.</Q>
It &s;prings &s;olely from our love for Rome, (it&s;elf a Gothic &s;tate,) which we draw from Roman writers at &s;chool; and our knowlege that the other Goths de&s;troyed the Roman empire. In&s;tead of turning our admiration to that great people, who could annihilate &s;o potent an empire; in&s;tead of ble&s;&s;ing
<PB N="viii" REF="428">the period that delivered all kingdoms from the dominion of one; we execrate our progenitors, to whom we are indebted for all our pre&s;ent happi|ne&s;ss! We look on the Goths as enemies of &s;cience, without once reflecting that wi&s;dom is at any time &s;uperior to &s;cience; and that the Goths only de|&s;pi&s;ed the &s;cience prevalent on the decline of Rome, which was folly, and is regarded as &s;uch by us at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>How different was the opinion entertained of the Goths by the Greeks and Romans! What ap|plau&s;e of the ju&s;tice, of the fortitude, of the tem|perance, of the wi&s;dom, of the Scythians, in the Grecian page, from Herodotus to the late&s;t period! What applau&s;e of the &s;ame virtues of the &s;ame people, under the names of Scythians or Goths, in the Roman works, even after they had &s;eized the Roman empire! Let us attend to the la&s;t a little, as more immediately concerning us, and that we may know how &s;hockingly we err in our puerile di&s;e&s;teem of our fathers.

The Romans often &s;hed more blood in one war than the Goths in conquering the Roman empire. Rude conquerors, tho ever &s;o few and merciful, always intro|duce their laws and manners: but the language of Italy, France, Spain, which is mere Latin corrupted by time, &s;uffi|ciently &s;hews that very few of the old inhabitants peri&s;hed. The de&s;olation of &s;ome parts of Italy was owing to the &s;eat of em|pire being removed to Con&s;tantinople, and the &s;enators abandoning their Italian villas in order to be near the court. So much in an&s;wer to a re&s;pectable writer, Dr. Robert&s;on, who in his <HI>View of Society</HI> prefixt to the hi&s;tory of Ch. V. has fallen into mi&s;takes on this &s;ubject.</P></NOTE>.' Rome, Rome, what were thy laurels to the&s;e? Great and divine people! it is no wonder that the few virtu|ous Romans &s;hould, as Salvianus &s;ays, fly to you their enemies, for protection: and that heaven
<PB N="x" REF="430">&s;hould, in your favour, have delivered the world from the tyrannic dotage of Rome.</P>
<P>Such virtues prevailed among the whole Goths, from the extremity of Scandinavia to the Vandals in Africa; the la&s;t of whom, tho deba&s;ed by an enervate clime, are yet the chief objects of the prai&s;e of Salvianus. Ho&s;pitality was particularly &s;acred. The Burgundian laws enact, 'Whoever refu&s;es his hou&s;e or fire to a &s;tranger, let him pay a large fine. If any man travelling on his bu&s;i|ne&s;s a&s;k lodging of a Burgundian, and it can be proved that he has &s;hewn the &s;tranger the hou&s;e of a Roman, let the Burgundian pay the &s;ame fine to the Roman, and an equal fine to the public trea|&s;ury.' A remarkable in&s;tance of regard to ho&s;pi|tality al&s;o occurs in Procopius <HI>Hi&s;t. lib.</HI> III.<HI>cap.</HI> 35, and <HI>lib.</HI> IV. <HI>c.</HI> 27. concerning the Gepidae, a celebrated Gothic nation on the we&s;t of pre&s;ent Hungary. An ab&s;tract of it follows. According to Lombardic in&s;titutions the crown of Lombardy was, after the death of Vaces, to pa&s;s to Ildi&s;gal. This prince being however expelled by intrigues retired to the Gepidae. Audouin, who had &s;eized the throne of Lombardy, &s;ent to demand Ildi&s;gal of the Gepidae his neighbours. The emperor Ju&s;tinian &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to &s;upport the reque&s;t. Tori&s;in king of the Gepidae, who had ju&s;t made peace with the Lombards and Romans, called a council, and &s;hewed the danger of refu&s;ing. But the council re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly, <HI>That it would be better for the whole nation, wives and children, to peri&s;h, than commit &s;uch a &s;acrilege again&s;t the laws
<PB N="xi" REF="431">of ho&s;pitality.</HI> That this continued the ca&s;e among the uncorrupted Goths of Scandinavia appears from Adam of Bremen, a writer of the eleventh century, who &s;ays all the people of Scandinavia, Danes, Normans, Swedes, are mo&s;t ho&s;pitable; e&s;pecially the Swedes, with whom no reproach could be greater than to refu&s;e lodging to a &s;tranger; and Grotius tells, that Charles, an ancient king of Sweden, made a law, that the hou&s;e which refu&s;ed a &s;tranger &s;hould be burnt to the ground.</P>
<P>Of their wi&s;dom let Herodotus &s;peak: and Dio, who calls them the wi&s;e&s;t of mankind. Of their courage let their enemies tell; and we, their &s;ons, who are here enjoying the countries which their &s;words won from the Romans their civili&s;ed bre|thren, who had conquered all nations yet yielded to them. Of their learning, when, by circum&s;tances, they advanced in &s;ociety in different countries, as after explained, let the Greeks, their elde&s;t pro|geny who enjoyed the&s;e circum&s;tances, declare; the Romans next; and the modern Europaeans, the la&s;t, but not lea&s;t, of their &s;ons. But their learning even in un&s;ocial wilds, and circum&s;tances of &s;ociety which precluded attention to elegance, while nece&s;&s;ity was the law, is a curious &s;ubject, and &s;hall be briefly touched.</P>
<P>Herodotus, <HI>lib.</HI> IV. <HI>c.</HI> 46, &s;ays, the Scythians were both learned and wi&s;e. Zamolxis, the early lawgiver of the Goths, is well known; and &s;o is Dicenens. Anachar&s;is was the next Scythic phi|lo&s;opher: he was of the royal family, his brother Cadreda, and nephew Indathyr&s;us, being kings
<PB N="xii" REF="432">of the Getae, or Parental Goths, peculiarly &s;o called. He lived with Solon, 590 years before Chri&s;t. Menander, the celebrated founder of the new comedy, and who&s;e drama was called the &s;chool of wi&s;dom, was a Goth of Getia, as Strabo, book VII. tells us from his works, and gives us the lines, apparently from one of his prologues.</P>

<P>Toxaris, a Scythian, was a learned phy&s;ician, whom Lucian introduces as chief interlocutor in his admirable dialogue entituled <HI>Toxaris,</HI> or, <HI>On Friend&s;hip;</HI> which is not only the mo&s;t virtuous, but the mo&s;t entertaining, of Lucian's works, be|ing enlivened with many tales and anecdotes. They who would know the virtues of the ancient Scythians are al&s;o e&s;pecially referred to it.</P>
<P>As to the later Scythians or Goths, who &s;ub|verted the Roman empire, the hi&s;torian of Engli&s;h poetry, &s;hewing our mi&s;takes as to their hatred of learning and the arts, well ob&s;erves, that, 'their enemies have been their hi&s;torians.' Such learning and arts as were then in vogue were, indeed, worthy of their contempt, as of our's now. The Goths knew that a learned king was u&s;ele&s;s in their then &s;ituation of war: and the &s;ole example
<PB N="xiii" REF="433">that can be found of their imagined contempt of letters &s;prung from this idea. It occurs in Pro|copius, <HI>Hi&s;t. Goth. lib.</HI> I. <HI>c.</HI> 2. where queen Ama|la&s;untha, wi&s;hing to teach her &s;on Alaric letters, the Gothic chiefs object to it, that arms, and not letters, had been formerly taught to their kings. Surely this pa&s;&s;age, &s;o often brought as a proof of their ignorance, was a proof of their wonted wi&s;|dom as events &s;hew. For Theodoric, who was unlearned, was the be&s;t and greate&s;t of kings: Theodahat, who was learned, brought the fir&s;t Gothic empire in Italy to utter ruin.</P>
<P>We look at the Goths thro a mo&s;t fal&s;e and im|perfect medium, that of the Roman writers of a barbarous age. And we have lo&s;t the noble&s;t mo|numents of their Gothic hi&s;tory, as Pliny's Twenty Books on the German war: the Gothic hi&s;tory of Dio: and that of Dexippus, of which Photius, <HI>Cod.</HI> 83, gives a brief hint. Yet even the mo&s;t barbarous writers, in the dotage of Rome, bear &s;ufficient witne&s;s of the Gothic glory. The very generals, who alone &s;ucceeded again&s;t the Goths, were their countrymen. Stilicho was a Vandal, or German Goth. Beli&s;arius was a Goth of Thrace. See Claudian and others for the fir&s;t; Procopius <HI>de Bello Vandal. lib.</HI> I. <HI>c.</HI> II. for the la&s;t. In&s;tead of imitating the barbarous Roman writers in their contempt of the ruder Goths, let us imi|tate the Goths in their contempt of doting Rome; and hear them expre&s;s it. "When we would brand an enemy with di&s;grace, we call him a Roman, comprehending under this one name of Roman

<PB N="xiv" REF="436">whatever is ba&s;e, is cowardly, is covetous, is fal&s;e, is vicious." <HI>Luitprandi Legatio, apud Muratori, Script. Ital,</HI> Indeed the contempt we bear to the Goths re&s;embles that of a &s;pendthrift heir to a great and prudent father. It is as fooli&s;h as that of the Por|tugue&s;e for the Ca&s;tillans, &s;o well held out by Melchior de Santa Cruz, who tells, that a Ca&s;|tillan going into a &s;hop in a Portugue&s;e village, a boy ran and told his mother to come and &s;peak to a Ca&s;tillan. Upon which his mother chid him &s;everely for affronting the gentleman with &s;uch a name; while the Spaniard knew it to be his highe&s;t honour.</P>
<P>It &s;hall only be further ob&s;erved, in this pre|face, that the author's attention to his quotations has been mo&s;t accurate and &s;acred. Mo&s;t of them he has compared repeatedly with the originals. This became the more nece&s;&s;ary, as inaccurate quotations are the grand defects of the literature of this century; if we except Germany and Scan|dinavia only, where, if an author were to quote fal&s;ely, he would go near to endure the character of a &s;coundrel and a liar. Indeed no literary crime is equal to this, for public faith attends an author; and infamy ought always to attend his intentional abu&s;e of it: nay in part his carele&s;&s;|ne&s;s; for a man is a very bad member of &s;ociety who teaches it error, compared to which even ignorance it&s;elf is knowlege. The mi&s;quotations and mi&s;con&s;tructions of Pelloutier, and many others, upon &s;imilar &s;ubjects, mu&s;t &s;hock every reflecting
<PB N="xv" REF="437">mind, for mo&s;t readers take quotations on tru&s;t. The author has &s;eldom, if ever, taken a quotation on tru&s;t; but has commonly verified tho&s;e few which &s;truck him at &s;econd-hand with the origi|nals. This plan he earne&s;tly recommends to &s;uch readers as wi&s;h to attain complete and immediate knowlege of the important facts here developed. For this end a li&s;t of the books and editions u&s;ed is prefixt. This li&s;t may al&s;o &s;erve as a directory for tho&s;e who chu&s;e to &s;tudy the &s;ubject in it's fountains; and will &s;ave much trouble; for had the author put down the other books he has pe|ru&s;ed for this de&s;ign, to no purpo&s;e, as there was nothing in them, the number would have been doubled. The author can &s;afely pledge his whole character in life, that he has never intentionally altered, or omitted, a &s;ingle letter in a quotation; nor ever given it the lea&s;t bias from it's open direct meaning. No toil has been &s;pared to guard again&s;t mi&s;takes: this little work has been revi&s;ed, and re-revi&s;ed, and revi&s;ed again: but our own errors &s;ingularly e&s;cape our eyes. Yet can there be no mi&s;take touching the grand, and leading, facts, which &s;tand on the authorities of all anti|quity. The author's toil was too enormous for him to trifle with any hypothe&s;is, and thus lo&s;e his labour, or any part of it. He &s;ought for facts alone. The &s;ole plea&s;ure &s;urely in a re&s;earch of this kind is purely mathematical, the delicious delight in repo&s;ing one's mind upon truth. For tho the truth in hi&s;toric re&s;earch be far from
<PB N="xvi" REF="438">mathematical, yet that highe&s;t probability, here called <HI>Hi&s;toric Truth,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in this, that tho you cannot demon&s;trate it true, yet you can prove all oppo&s;ite opinions to be fal&s;e; &s;o that, as truth is one, and no two oppo&s;ite opinions can be both true, this remains Hi&s;toric Truth.</P>

<ITEM>Orphei Opera Ge&s;neri. Lip&s;iae, 1764. 8vo. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that the age of the&s;e pretended poems of Orpheus, to Mu&s;aeus his &s;on, has not been examined. Some lately a&s;cribe them to an Onoma|critus, upon no grounds whatever. They are palpably forgeries of the fir&s;t, or &s;econd, century; but as near the Homeric language as any modern poet could forge an imitation of Chaucer. They are not earlier, becau&s;e unknown to all writers preceding that time. Plato, <HI>in Cratylo,</HI> quotes <HI>one</HI> line of Orpheus; Diodorus Siculus I. 11, 12, <HI>two;</HI> but they are not found in the pre&s;ent. Orpheus was indeed the Zamolxis, the Zoroa&s;ter, the founder of their religion, to the Greek prie&s;ts, and they had forged a hymn or two in his name before. But the&s;e poems to Mu&s;aeus are fir&s;t quoted by Ju&s;tin Martyr in the &s;econd century; and &s;eem to have been forged to &s;upport the Pagan faith again&s;t the Chri&s;|tian, then rapidly advancing, when the <HI>Carmina Sibyllina</HI> were forged on the other &s;ide. They relate to Pagan my&s;teries; and the Argonautics form a mock go&s;pel of Orpheus.</ITEM>

<ITEM>The time when Solinus wrote could not be di&s;covered by Era&s;mus, the Scaligers, Lip&s;ius, Grotius, Salma&s;ius, &amp;c. in &s;hort, by all, from the revival of letters to this hour. There mu&s;t be witchcraft in the ca&s;e, for nothing is more ea&s;y. Solinus, c. 38, &s;peaking of Judaea, &s;ays, <HI>Judeae capui fuit Hiero&s;olyma, &s;ed exci&s;a e&s;t. Suc|ce&s;&s;it Hiericus; et hoec de&s;iit, Artaxerois bello &s;ubacta.</HI> Who does not know that this war of Artaxerxes happened in the time of Alexander Severus, about the year 230? See Lampridius, &amp;c. Salma&s;ius, on this pa&s;&s;age, calls Solinus a fool, and dreams about the old Artaxerxes! Solinus al&s;o mentions Byzantium, &s;imply, not as Con&s;tantinople, &s;o that he wrote before 330. But he al&s;o mentions the Getae, not by the name of Gothi, given them on their inva&s;ion 250, nor does he hint at that inva&s;ion; &s;o that he clearly wrote between 230 and 250, &s;ay 240. The la&s;t edition by Goezius is the wor&s;t we have of any cla&s;&s;ic. Solinus de&s;erves a better fate, for had Pliny peri&s;hed, how great mu&s;t have been his value! As it is, his book is not a mere ab&s;tract of Pliny, but has valuable additions.</ITEM>

<P>THE &s;ubject meant to be briefly treated in this di&s;&s;ertation is &s;o exten&s;ive, and im|portant, that two va&s;t volumes might well be occupied with it alone. For upon it, as a wide and perpetual ba&s;is, &s;tands the whole hi&s;tory of Europe; excepting only that of Ru&s;&s;ia, Poland, and Hungary. All the re&s;t is in the hands of the progeny of the Goths, or as we may ju&s;tly &s;ay of the Goths: and there actually exi&s;ts in Europe, at
<PB N="4" REF="449">this moment, a &s;ixth &s;upreme empire, equal to the Scythian, A&s;&s;yrian, Per&s;ian, Grecian, or Roman. For the colonies and dominions of the Europeans in America, and A&s;ia, may &s;urely be put as equivalent, at lea&s;t, to tho&s;e of the Romans in A&s;ia and Africa. This Sixth Empire is not in|deed under one head; but neither was the Gre|cian, &s;ave for the &s;hort reign of Alexander. Nor let us, deceived by vulgar blindne&s;s, e&s;teem it a di&s;grace to be called by our real name of GOTHS, but rather exult in the glorious title. For, as &s;hall afterwards be &s;hewn, the Greeks them&s;elves were Goths, being originally Pela&s;gi, a Scythic or Gothic colony: and the Romans al&s;o were of the &s;ame &s;tem. And tho we, mi&s;led by a puerile love of the Romans, revile the ruder Goths, our fathers, as de&s;pi&s;ers of learning and the arts; be|cau&s;e they &s;corned the &s;ophi&s;tical reading, and fan|ta&s;tic arts, prevalent on the decline of the Roman empire, which we at pre&s;ent &s;corn; yet, as &s;hewn in the preface, the Goths were the friends of every elegant art, and u&s;eful &s;cience; and when not con&s;trained to arms alone by the inevitable &s;itua|tion, and &s;pirit, of their &s;ociety, they carried every art and &s;cience to heights unknown before; as the ancient Greeks and modern Europeans might wit|ne&s;s. In wi&s;dom, that perfection of human nature,
<Q>And tho no &s;cience fairly worth the &s;even,</Q>
ancient authors<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dio apud Jornand, de rebus Get. c. 5. Herodot. IV. 46. Strabo, lib. VII.</NOTE> call the rude Goths the fir&s;t of mankind. And in arms what people equalled tho&s;e who conquered the Romans, who had con|quered all? who, without military di&s;cipline, overcame the greate&s;t military di&s;cipline in the world? who ru&s;hing at once, as lightning from heaven, da&s;hed the &s;trong and deep-rooted oak of Roman power to pieces; and &s;cattered the nume|rous trophies, that adorned its branches, over the &s;urrounding fields?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="450" MS="y">Before proceeding further i mu&s;t apologi&s;e to the reader for compre&s;&s;ing my own materials for the pre&s;ent di&s;qui&s;ition, and which might have filled a large quarto volume, into &s;uch contracted bounds. For tho i am a declared enemy to large books, yet to the learned reader it may &s;eem au|dacious, even to attempt &s;o va&s;t a theme in &s;uch &s;mall compa&s;s. But he will con&s;ider that the pur|po&s;e of this work, into which my re&s;earches into Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory led me, forbids my entering into the &s;ubject &s;o fully as its importance warrants. As M. de Guignes has obliged the world with an Hi&s;tory of the Huns, in Four Quarto Volumes; fraught with all that information, which his great learning in the Ea&s;tern tongues enabled him to give; &s;o it is earne&s;tly to be wi&s;hed that &s;ome writer of eminent learning, indu&s;try, and ability, would give us an Hi&s;tory of the Scythians, at as great, or greater, extent. Such a work would be of the utmo&s;t advantage both to ancient, and modern hi&s;tory. Yet, tho confined to brevity, every toil has been exerted to render the pre&s;ent attempt veracious, accurate, and di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>It is proper fir&s;t to &s;hew that <HI>Scythae, Getae, Gothi,</HI> were but different names for one and the &s;ame people; as we call them <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom the French call <HI>E&s;pagnols;</HI> the Italians, <HI>Spagnuoli:</HI> or as the French call the Engli&s;h <HI>Anglois;</HI> the Italians, <HI>Ingle&s;i.</HI> The learned reader will &s;mile at my think|ing it nece&s;&s;ary to explain a matter &s;o well known, as the identity of the Scythians, Getae, and Goths; but this tract is meant for the public at large, and it is always better to tell a reader what he may per|haps know, than run the ri&s;que of ob&s;curing a whole work by omitting what he may not know. I &s;hall however be very brief on this article; re|ferring tho&s;e who wi&s;h for more information upon it to Sheringham<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De Gent. Angl. Orig. c. 9.</NOTE>, Pelloutier<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des Celtes.</NOTE>, and Ihre<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Praefat. ad Glo&s;&s;ar. Suio-Goth.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="451">Of the <HI>Scythians</HI> we find a mo&s;t ample account given by Herodotus; and which occupies almo&s;t all his Fourth Book. In the &s;ame book he al&s;o mentions the <HI>Getae,</HI> telling us that Darius &s;ubdued them in advancing again&s;t the wandering Scythians, who lived on the other &s;ide of the I&s;ter, or Danube; and adding a remarkable circum&s;tance that the Getae believed in the immortality of the &s;oul, and that they were the brave&s;t, and mo&s;t ju&s;t, of the Thracians. Thus from the earlie&s;t periods of hi&s;tory we find mention of the Scythae and Getae, as only divided by a river; but this is quoted &s;olely to &s;hew that the&s;e names are thus early re|corded<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>AE&s;chylus, who flouri&s;hed about fifty years before Hero|dotus, is perhaps the fir&s;t who mentions the Scythae:</P>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. <HI>In Prometheo.</HI></Q>
<P>They are the Galactophagi, or Milk-eaters, <HI>i. e.</HI> Pa&s;toral people of Homer; as his Hippomolgi are the Sarmatae. Iliad xiii. <HI>init.</HI> and Strabo. He&s;iod has Galactophagi.</P></NOTE> After this we find them mentioned by almo&s;t every Greek writer, even familiarly; for Geta is a common name for a &s;lave in Greek comedy, and in Terence's tran&s;lations: the Greeks procuring many &s;laves from the&s;e their barbarous brethren, either by art or force.</P>
<P>But the name of <HI>Goths</HI> is not near &s;o ancient; the very fir&s;t mention of it being in the time of the emperor Decius, in the year of Chri&s;t 250, as Mr. Gibbon &s;hews. At which time a part of them bur&s;t from Getia into the empire, under Cneva: and Decius, attempting to repell them from Thrace, was conquered and &s;lain. After this we find them as frequently in the Latin authors by the names of <HI>Getae,</HI> or <HI>Gothi,</HI> as formerly the <HI>Scythians</HI> in the Greek; and, as Mr. Gibbon well ob&s;erves, all the Greek writers after this period &s;till uniformly call tho&s;e <HI>Scythae,</HI> whom the Latin authors denomi|nate <HI>Gothi.</HI></P>

But this is an age of etymological frenzy; and we pay &s;uch attention to words that facts e&s;cape us. No author, before Cluverius, ever dreamed that the Goths differed from the Getae. Even in the darke&s;t ages their identity was clearly &s;een. The Goths in the year 250 came from the very &s;ame ground where Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy, Diony&s;ius the Geographer, and all the writers from the fir&s;t century down to that very time, had placed the Getae. The Romans before 250 only knew the Getae by Greek report, and gave them of cour&s;e the Greek name: in 250 when they actually &s;aw, and fought with, them, they called them by their proper name Gothi; as they &s;tudied not mu&s;ic nor accents in pro&s;e, as the Greeks did, but put the name as &s;poken, only with a Latin termination.
<PB N="11" REF="458">Dio, who wrote about 250, calls them &s;till Getae, as we have &s;een. Succeeding writers expre&s;ly explain that the Getae and Gothi were the &s;ame; as common &s;en&s;e might convince us: for how could the prodigious nation of Getae, &s;o remark|able in ancient authors, vani&s;h at once? The Goths came from the very territory of the Getae; and no authority would be required for any one of the &s;malle&s;t penetration to pronounce them the &s;ame people. But in &s;cience it &s;eems doubtful whether the mo&s;t fal&s;ehood ari&s;es from the weak prejudices and caprice of the learned, or from the &s;uperficiality of the ignorant.

Herodotus, Dio|dorus Siculus, Ptolemy, and other ancients, fully in&s;truct us that the Ma&s;&s;agetae were a Scythic nation; and Diodorus &s;ays they were a colony of the Scythians on the Euxine. The&s;e two are perhaps the only ancient writers who confound the Scythae with the Sarmatae, or with the Tartars. Not one of the ancients confounds the Scythae with the Celts.

<ITEM>1. The <HI>Celts,</HI> the mo&s;t ancient inhabitants that can be traced; and who were to the other races what the &s;avages of America are to the European &s;ettlers there.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The <HI>Iberi</HI> of Spain and Aquita|nia,
<PB N="18" REF="467" MS="y">who were Mauri and had pa&s;t from Africa. The&s;e Two Races were few in number; the Celts being mo&s;tly de&s;troyed by the Sarmatae and Scythae; and few of the Iberi having come into Europe.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>Sarmatae,</HI> who were in all ap|pearance originally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of &s;outh-we&s;t Tartary, but expelled by the Tartars. For their &s;peech, the Sarmatic or Slavonic is remote from the Tartaric; and their per&s;ons, full of grace and maje&s;ty, are dif|ferent from tho&s;e of Tartars: &s;o that they are not of Tartaric origin.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The <HI>Scythians,</HI> who originated, as &s;hall pre&s;ently be &s;een, from pre&s;ent Per&s;ia; and &s;pred from thence to the Euxine, and almo&s;t over all Europe.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In the ancient authors the&s;e grand races of men are marked and clear; and that chief di&s;tinction of the four languages &s;till remains to certify them. The Celtic is &s;poken by the Iri&s;h and Welch. The Iberian &s;till partly &s;urvives in the Ga&s;cunian or Ba&s;que, and Mauritanic. The Sarmatic is the va&s;t Slavonic tongue. The Scythic comprehends the other nations; but e&s;pecially the Germans and Scandinavians, who&s;e &s;peech is le&s;s mixt. No di|vi&s;ions can be more accurate and preci&s;e, from pre&s;ent proofs, as well as from ancient writers. It is to modern authors, and &s;ome of them illu&s;trious, that we owe any confu&s;ion upon this &s;ubject, ari&s;|ing from a very &s;imple cau&s;e, to wit, that good authors are rarely antiquaries, and that men of great talents are &s;eldom &s;o indu&s;trious as to go to the bottom of a &s;ubject, where alone however the truth is to be found. Thus we find one modern writer<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Pelloutier.</NOTE> gravely pronouncing that the Scythians were <HI>Celts,</HI> becau&s;e he was a Frenchman, and wanted to make France the parent of all nations, which he ea&s;ily proves; for he was enabled to &s;hew, from all the ancients, that the Greeks, Italians, Germans, &amp;c. &amp;c. were infallibly of Scythic origin;
<PB N="19" REF="468" MS="y">and, as he &s;ays, the Scythians were Celts, it fol|lowed that all the nations of Europe were Celtic. Unhappily he forgot that the antients di&s;tingui&s;h more widely between the Scythians and Celts than between any other Grand Races of men; for, from the days of Herodotus to the late&s;t voice of anti|quity, the Scythians are marked as proceeding from A&s;ia, and the Celts as confined to the utmo&s;t we&s;t of Europe. Nor can any tongues be of more different form than the Celtic and Gothic. Thus we find another<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Macpher&s;on.</NOTE> telling us upon <HI>his own</HI> authority, that the Goths were Sarmatae, without once re|flecting that all the antients are direct again&s;t him; and that a nation &s;peaking the Gothic tongue can no more be the &s;ame with one &s;peaking the Slavonic, than a Swede can be a Ru&s;&s;ian. Thus we find others<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gibbon, Richard&s;on, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> calling the Scythae Tartars, and the Tartars Scythae, forgetting that the ancients did not even know the exi&s;tence of the Tartars till the Huns appeared; and that they di&s;tingui&s;h the Scy|thae from the Huns in the mo&s;t po&s;itive manner; forgetting that the Scythae &s;poke the Gothic tongue, a language as remote from the Tartaric as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Ihre, a man of indu&s;try and &s;kill in the Gothic, but of &s;mall learning and &s;till le&s;s penetration, in the preface to his Suio-Gothic Glo&s;&s;ary, ob&s;erves the danger of attempting to trace Scythic words, given us by ancient writers, in the Gothic; becau&s;e, &s;ays he, it appears that the Scythians had anciently different tongues. For Herodotus &s;ays that in Scy|thia were Seven languages. Strabo, <HI>lib.</HI> X. <HI>p.</HI> 503, &s;ays the Alani, a Scythic nation, had twenty-&s;ix languages. Mithridates king of Pontus, we are told, learned Twenty-two tongues, to conver&s;e with his own &s;ubjects, who were chiefly Scythic, or at lea&s;t in the old &s;eats of the Scythae. Lucian &s;ays, Tiri|dates, a &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Mithridates in tho&s;e parts,
<PB N="20" REF="469" MS="y">reque&s;ted a Pantomimus from Nero, as a general interpreter of ge&s;tures to his &s;ubjects, not being able to under&s;tand &s;o many tongues. The Scho|lia&s;t of Apollonius Rhodius IV. 321. &s;ays, there were Fifty Scythian nations. Ihre remarks ju&s;tly that the ancients comprized all the nations in the oblique a&s;cent from the Ca&s;pian &s;ea up to the far|the&s;t point of Scandinavia under the general name of Scythians; and, let me add, for a good rea&s;on, becau&s;e they were &s;o, all &s;ave the Sarmatians, whom &s;ome ancient writers only called Scythae, before it was fully di&s;covered that the Sarmatae were of quite a di&s;tinct race and language, as known in the time of Tacitus and Ptolemy. Let me ob&s;erve upon this that the whole is a &s;uperficial mi&s;repre&s;entation. Herodotus does not &s;ay that there were &s;even languages in Scythia, but that there was one Scy|thic nation, the Argippae, called al&s;o Phalacri, or Bald Scythians, who lived at a va&s;t di&s;tance (<GAP DESC="foreign">) to the ea&s;t<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Lib. iv. c. 23, 24.</NOTE>. He ob&s;erves there was a number of countries and regions be|tween them and the others; and adds, 'the Scythae who go to them pa&s;s by &s;even interpreters, and as many tongues.' Herodotus is on the contrary a clear witne&s;s that the Scythae had but one &s;peech; for, <HI>lib.</HI> IV. <HI>c.</HI> 117, he tells that &s;ome of the Sarma|tae learned the SCYTHIC tongue (<GAP DESC="foreign">) from the Amazons. He al&s;o repeatedly tells us that the Scythians denominate &s;uch a per&s;on or thing by &s;uch a name in THEIR language<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">iv. 59<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp;c.</NOTE>. Strabo's te&s;timony concerning the Alani, a &s;mall nation of the Scythae, having twenty-&s;ix languages, is mat|ter of laughter, not of authority; being only likely to be true when the Ca&s;pian &s;ea was a gulf of the Northern Ocean, as Strabo tells; and akin to the men with dogs heads, or hor&s;es feet, and other impo&s;&s;ible fictions of travellers, which impo&s;ed on grave authors of antiquity. If Mithridates learned
<PB N="21" REF="470">Twenty-two tongues, it was not to conver&s;e with his &s;ubjects, but from his love of learning; and the number is no doubt va&s;tly magnified, as u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es. Lucian's tale is a ri&s;ible and good one; but did Ihre think it a matter of fact? That the Alani, as a &s;cattered nation bordering on the Sar|matae and on the Tartars, had many dialects, we may well believe. So we may that in the kingdom of Pontus, comprizing Galatae or German Gauls, A&s;iatic Scythians, Syrians of Cappadocia, Sarma|tians, Colchians, Chaldaei, Greeks; there were three radical languages, the Scythian, Sarmatic, and A&s;&s;yrian, which might well ferment into many dialects. The Scholia&s;t of Apollonius &s;ays nothing of languages, but only &s;hews the va&s;t extent of the Scythae.</P>
<P>This point required attention becau&s;e a diver&s;ity of tongues would have argued the term <HI>Scythoe</HI> an indefinite appellation; and it is believed the reader will now &s;ee that there is no authority whatever for &s;uch an idea. That &s;ome Scythic words mentioned by the ancients &s;hould not now be found in Gothic, is le&s;s &s;urprizing than that &s;everal &s;hould, of which in&s;tances may be found in Ihre, Sheringham, and others. Languages change by time; many words drop into de&s;uetude, and others &s;upply their place. He mu&s;t be a &s;anguine antiquary indeed who would expect to find every Scythic word in the remains of the Gothic which we have! It may therefore be rea&s;onably concluded that, as the Scythae are a mo&s;t marked and di&s;tinct people in ancient accounts, &s;o they had but one general &s;peech, the Scythic, or Gothic; tho perhaps divided into dialects as dif|ferent as the Engli&s;h and German are now.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to that important que&s;tion, Whether the Scythians came originally from Scan|dinavia into A&s;ia, or from A&s;ia into Europe?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Scythians originated from Scandinavia,</HI> we have <HI>one</HI> authority, that of Jornandes, who wrote about the year 530. Jornandes was him&s;elf a
<PB N="22" REF="471">Goth<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">He was an <HI>Alanus.</HI> Ihre, praef. ad Glo&s;&s;.

If this was the ca&s;e, the abridgment mu&s;t be inaccurate, being &s;olely from memory after a reading of three days<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P>Sed, ut non mentiar, ad triduanam lectionem, di&s;pen&s;a|toris ejus beneficio, libros ip&s;os antehac relegi; quorum, quamvis verba non recolo, &s;en&s;um tamen, et res actas, credo me integre tenere: ad quas nonnulla ex hi&s;toricis Graecis et Latinis addidi convenientia; initium, finemque, et plura in medio, <HI>mea</HI> dictione permi&s;cens. <HI>Praef.</HI> For the &s;ettlement of the Scythae on the Euxine he quotes old &s;ongs, and Ablavius, who is thought by Grotius to have written under Con&s;tan|tius II. and was certainly a late author.

Bayer, in <HI>Di&s;&s;ert. de Cimmeriis</HI> has ridiculed this mook emigra|tion of the Goths from Scandinavia; and ju&s;tly a&s;ks how Ab|lavius or Jornandes could know any thing of the matter?</P></NOTE>. But it appears from the words of Jornandes, underquoted, that he fol|lowed Ca&s;&s;iodorus, but added &s;ome things from Greek and Roman writers. However this be, Jor|nandes puts Scandinavia as the ancient Scythia, from which the Scythians, afterward called Goths, came; for he rightly thro his whole work u&s;es <HI>Scythae, Getae,</HI> and <HI>Gothi,</HI> as &s;ynonymous words. He makes them pour from Scandinavia down to the Euxine; thence into A&s;ia, which they &s;ubdue down to Egypt, where they conquer Vexores, as an|tient writers &s;ay the Scythae did about 3660 years before Chri&s;t. He then gives the hi&s;tory of the Amazons, or Scythian female warriors; a fable in all probability grounded on real hi&s;tory, and ari&s;ing from two &s;ources.

After this we find &s;ome account of the learning of the Scythians or Goths, their manners, &amp;c. and he next pa&s;&s;es to Maximin the emperor, who was a Thracian
<PB N="23" REF="472" MS="y">Goth; the irruption of the Goths in the time of Decius, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Such is the line which Jornandes per&s;ues: and his account of the origin of the Scythae was blindly followed by I&s;idorus, by Beda who calls Scandina|via Scythia, by Paulus Diaconus, by the geogra|pher of Ravenna, and by innumerable others in the dark ages. Nay &s;uch an effect may even a very weak writer (for &s;uch Jornandes is) have upon literature, that one &s;entence of Jornandes has over|turned the very ba&s;is of the hi&s;tory of Europe. This famous &s;entence is in his fourth chapter, <HI>Ex hac igitur Scandia in&s;ula, qua&s;i</HI> OFFICINA GEN|TIUM, <HI>aut certe velut</HI> VAGINA NATIONUM, <HI>cum rege &s;uo nomine Berig Gothi quondam memorantur egre&s;&s;i.</HI> Upon this one &s;entence have all modern hi&s;torians, nay &s;uch writers as Monte&s;quieu, Gib|bon, and others of the fir&s;t name, built! Now it can clearly be &s;hewn that Scandinavia was down to a late period, nay is at pre&s;ent, almo&s;t over-run with enormous fore&s;ts, where there was no room for population. Adam of Bremen<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Adam Bremen. Hi&s;t. Eccle&s;. cap. De Situ Daniae.</NOTE>, who wrote in the Eleventh century, in&s;tructs us that even in Denmark, at that time, the &s;ea coa&s;ts alone were peopled; while the inner parts of the country were one va&s;t fore&s;t. If &s;uch was the ca&s;e in Den|mark, we may gue&s;s that in Scandinavia even the &s;hores were hardly peopled. Scandinavia is al&s;o a mo&s;t mountainous region; and, among a barbaric and unindu&s;trious people, the mountains are almo&s;t unpeopled. In fact, the &s;ole colonies that ever went from Scandinavia were the Piks<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><P>The name is thus &s;pelt to avoid the double meaning of the word <HI>Picti,</HI> or <HI>Picts</HI> as we tran&s;late it; and in conformity with the origin of the people who were Piki or Peukeni, (&s;ee Part II.) and the name of their country in Norway, which in the Scandinavian and Icelandic hi&s;tories, &amp;c. is called <HI>Pika,</HI> pronounced and &s;pelt <HI>Vika,</HI> for they have no P, and pronounce P as V.

<P>But to di&s;credit for ever this dream of Jornandes, who is in fact the &s;ole authority on that &s;ide of the que&s;tion; for other writers down to our times, tho they might be reckoned by hundreds, all &s;tand upon his foundation alone; let us proceed to evince beyond a doubt that the Scythians came from A&s;ia; and that of cour&s;e Scandinavia mu&s;t have been al|mo&s;t the la&s;t point of their population, in&s;tead of the fir&s;t, or <HI>punctum &s;aliens.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>That the Scythians originated from A&s;ia</HI> can be proved by many authorities, even the lea&s;t of them &s;uperior to that of Jornandes.</P>
<P N="1">1. Trogus Pompeius in the reign of Augu&s;tus, with &s;edulous diligence and great ability, compiled an univer&s;al hi&s;tory, afterward in the reign of Antoninus Pius ab&s;tracted by Ju&s;tin, who dedicates his work to that prince. From Trogus, Ju&s;tin<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. lib. I. c. 1. lib. II. c. 3.</NOTE> tells us that the Scythians contended with the Egyptians, then e&s;teemed the earlie&s;t of nations, for antiquity: and that A&s;ia was conquered by them, and tributary to them, for no le&s;s a &s;pace than Fifteen Hundred years, before Ninus, founder of the A&s;&s;yrian Empire, put an end to the tribute.</P>
<P>The ideas of the ancients concerning this fir&s;t Supreme Empire were, as might be expected, very confu&s;ed. Trogus and Ju&s;tin &s;ay the Scythians conquered Vexores king of Egypt, fifteen hundred years before the time of Ninus. I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius, in his notes on Ju&s;tin, wonders that Trogus &s;hould &s;ay the Scythians conquered Se&s;o&s;tris; while Hero|dotus, Dicaearchus, Diodorus Siculus, and others, &s;ay that Se&s;o&s;tris vanqui&s;hed the Scythae. Vo&s;&s;ius did not &s;ee that Se&s;o&s;tris was out of all que&s;tion; and that it is Vexores whom Ju&s;tin bears, as dif|ferent
<PB N="25" REF="474">a name, and per&s;on, from Se&s;o&s;tris as can well be imagined. Vexores lived about 3660 years before Chri&s;t: Se&s;o&s;tris about 1480! But Vo&s;&s;ius is not the only learned man who, from want of common di&s;cernment, has even confounded this Fir&s;t Scythic Empire with an eruption of the Scythae into A&s;ia, about 1600 years after Ninus; while the Great Scythic Empire was terminated by Ninus after la&s;ting more than 1500 years. In the works of the Lip&s;ii, Scaligeri, Salma&s;ii, Vo&s;&s;ii, Grotii, one finds every thing but common &s;en&s;e, without which every thing is le&s;s than nothing. Trogus, who was in civil hi&s;tory what Pliny was in natural hi&s;tory, an indefatigable compiler of the whole knowlege that could be found in preceding authors, di&s;covered this earlie&s;t empire, as Time draws truth out of the well. The war of Se&s;o&s;tris again&s;t the Scythae, about 1480 years before Chri&s;t, narrated by Hero|dotus and Diodorus Siculus, mu&s;t by no means be confounded with events that happened 1500 years before Ninus, as Ju&s;tin &s;tates, or 3660 years before Chri&s;t. From Ju&s;tin it is apparent that the Scythians, fixt and re&s;ident in pre&s;ent Per&s;ia, per|haps 2000 years before Ninus, carried on a war again&s;t Vexores 1500 years before the time of Ni|nus, and &s;ubduing the we&s;t of A&s;ia made it tri|butary, till Ninus delivered it by e&s;tabli&s;hing the A&s;&s;yrian Empire on the ruins of the Scythian.</P>
<P>In fact, we have good authorities<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Strabo may al&s;o be adduced, who, lib. xi. p. 507, &s;ays, "neither the ancient affairs of the Per&s;ians, Medes, Syrians, nor Scythians, have much credit in hi&s;tory."

<P>Eu&s;ebius, in his Chronicle, p. 13, puts the Scy|thians as the immediate de&s;cendants of Noah down to Serug his &s;eventh de&s;cendant; that is, a &s;pace of about 400 years, as generations are computed at that period of longevity. This was the Scythian age, the mo&s;t ancient after the flood; the Scythi&s;m of Epiphanius, for his barbari&s;m was the period pre|ceding the flood.

<P>The Chronicon Pa&s;chale, p. 23, makes Barba|ri&s;m precede the deluge, then Scythi&s;m, Helle|ni&s;m, Judai&s;m, as Epiphanius.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be thought that the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tic authorities prove too much, as they mark the whole immediate de&s;cendents of Noah as Scythians; and of cour&s;e might prove all the nations of the globe Scythians, as by Scripture account they all &s;prung from Noah. But it is the line of Shem down to Serug, and not of Ham or Japhet, who are marked as Scythians; and Shem was reputed the father of A&s;ia, as Ham of Africa, and Japhet of Europe. The flood is now generally reputed a local event; but accept the&s;e authorities any way, and they &s;hew that the Scythians originated in A&s;ia. The coin|cidence of the&s;e writers with Trogus is fixt, and &s;trong. Ninus is reputed the founder of the tower of Babel; which was followed by the di&s;per&s;ion of mankind. He was the founder of the A&s;&s;yrian em|pire who&s;e capital was Babylon, and the di&s;per&s;ion of the Scythians followed. Of the race of Ham, by &s;cripture account, was Nimrod thought Ninus, and A&s;hur thought father of the A&s;&s;yrians, to which race al&s;o belong the fathers of nations along the ea&s;t end of the Mediterranean, the Arabic gulf of Red
<PB N="27" REF="476">&s;ea, and thro all Arabia. Certain it is that the Arabic is a dialect of the Grand A&s;&s;yrian language, as are the Syrian, Phoenician, Hebrew, Chaldee, Coptic, Aby&s;&s;inian, &amp;c. all &s;i&s;ter dialects; and the A&s;&s;yrians, who overturned the Scythian empire, formed one great language or race of men, extend|ing along the ea&s;t end of the Mediterranean and Arabian &s;eas, to the Erythraean &s;ea, gulf of Per|&s;ia, and river Euphrates. From them the Egyp|tians and White Ethiopians mu&s;t al&s;o have &s;prung, as their language and &s;ituation declare.</P>
<P>From the&s;e &s;maller lights, compared with Tro|gus or Ju&s;tin, it will appear as evident as &s;o very remote an event can well be, that the Scythian Empire was the fir&s;t of which any memory has reached us. And it is a plau&s;ible opinion, adopted by late mythologi&s;ts, that Saturn, Jupiter, Bac|chus, &amp;c. were monarchs of this fir&s;t empire, who&s;e glorious actions procured them divine honours from their &s;ubjects after their death. This empire was perfectly barbarie, and the &s;eat of war, not of arts. All nations, &s;ave the Egyptians, were then pa&s;toral; and the Scythians, as de&s;cribed by Hero|dotus, on the Euxine were certainly more advanced in &s;ociety than when holding the empire of A&s;ia; for agriculture was then known to one or two na|tions of them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P>Horace de&s;cribes them as Tacitus does the Germans;

This wan|dering &s;tate of pa&s;toral &s;ociety will at once account for &s;o many of the Scythae leaving their domi|nions, on the A&s;&s;yrian conque&s;t, that ea&s;tern tra|dition reported the di&s;per&s;ion of men to have followed that event. But no doubt va&s;t numbers &s;till remained in Per&s;ia, and &s;ubmitted to their new lords. Herodotus, Diodorus, only mention
<PB N="28" REF="477">the Scythae <HI>Nomades</HI> of the north of Per&s;ia to have pa&s;t the Araxes; and the Scythae in the &s;outh remained, and were ever known by the name of Per&s;ians, as at this day.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked how the memory of this va&s;t empire e&s;caped Herodotus, and yet was pre&s;erved by later writers? But we mu&s;t reflect that it is always time that di&s;covers the truth: that Hero|dotus might not be ver&s;ed in the ea&s;tern languages or hi&s;tory: and that Homer him&s;elf &s;ays not a word of Ninus, Babylon, or the A&s;&s;yrian empire, nor of the Median. Many of the mo&s;t important facts in ancient hi&s;tory were recovered after the time of Herodotus, by writers who lived in the countries where they happened. Nor let it be imagined that what Herodotus &s;ays, <HI>lib.</HI> IV. <HI>c.</HI> 5. with regard to the Scythians, their boa&s;ting of be|ing the newe&s;t of nations, and not exi&s;ting above a thou&s;and years before Darius, &s;on of Hy&s;ta&s;pes, be con&s;idered as evidence again&s;t the exi&s;tence of the Scythian empire. For not to mention the well-known fabulous di&s;po&s;ition of Herodotus, who&s;e work has been rightly called the &s;hade be|tween poetry and hi&s;tory; and who, from his love of the marvellous and new, might a&s;cribe this idea to the Scythians; we may well reconcile his authority with that of other ancients, by &s;aying that the Scythians, tho the mo&s;t ancient people of which hi&s;tory pre&s;erves remembrance, were yet new in the &s;eats they held in the time of Herodotus, who &s;peaks e&s;pecially of the Scythae on the we&s;t of the Euxine. Becau&s;e, after being expelled by Ninus, &s;ome centuries mu&s;t have pa&s;t before they came to the we&s;t of the Euxine and down to the Danube, where Herodotus finds the Scythae he dwelt on; and between Ninus and Darius about 1800 years occur.</P>
<P N="2">2. Herodotus him&s;elf is a &s;ufficient witne&s;s that the Scythians did not originate from Scandinavia, but from pre&s;ent Per&s;ia. For he tells us, book IV.
<PB N="29" REF="448" MS="y">ch. 11. that they pa&s;&s;ed the Araxes, and entered the Bo&s;phorus Cimmerius. The Araxes, it is well known, is a large river of Armenia, running into the Ca&s;pian &s;ea. Herodotus IV. 40. men|tions 'the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, and the Araxes running to the ea&s;t.' Hence it is clear that, even by the account of Herodotus him&s;elf, the Scythians pa&s;&s;ed up from Per&s;ia to the Euxine. He there|fore affords a collateral proof of the exi&s;tence of the fir&s;t Scythian empire, by making his later Scythians a&s;cend from the country where other ancients place it; and at the &s;ame time is an ab&s;o|lute witne&s;s that the Scythae could not come from Scandinavia, &s;eeing their cour&s;e was in direct op|po&s;ition, proceeding from the &s;outh-ea&s;t to the north-we&s;t, in&s;tead of the contrary.</P>
<P N="3">3. Diodorus Siculus confirms the account of He|rodotus, telling us, <HI>lib.</HI> II. <HI>p.</HI> 155, that the Scythian Nomades were at fir&s;t a &s;mall nation on the Araxes, whence they &s;pred to Cauca&s;us, and the Palus Maeotis. He al&s;o greatly &s;trengthens the narra|tive of Trogus; tho he confounds the fir&s;t em|pire of the Scythae with their later inva&s;ion, and a&s;cribes to this late inva&s;ion a protracted empire, and many great kings; in which he contradicts the be&s;t and earlie&s;t writers. And had not Ju&s;tin, Epiphanius, Eu&s;ebius, and the Chronicon Pa&s;|chale, remained, we might to this hour confound two va&s;t events, the inva&s;ion of Egypt by the Scythae from their original &s;eats 3660 years before Chri&s;t, and their later inva&s;ion 640 years before Chri&s;t; &s;o uncertain is traditional chronology!</P>

<ITEM>2. That Herodotus, Diodorus, and indeed all writers who have occa&s;ion to mention the &s;ubject, down to the Sixth century, when Jornandes the fir&s;t mona&s;tic hi&s;torian wrote, and darkne&s;s, error, and ignorance, &s;urrounded the world, are in direct oppo&s;ition to Jornandes. The&s;e early writers of enlightened times uniformly make the Scythae pa&s;s, from the &s;outh of A&s;ia, up in a North We&s;t direc|tion, till they &s;pred over all Europe: and to op|po&s;e the &s;ingle te&s;timony of Jornandes to &s;uch au|thorities would be ab&s;urd beyond all ab&s;urdity. Gro|tius, who maintains it, from a &s;illy wi&s;h of honour|ing Sweden, has been forced totally to garble and alter it, by bringing tho&s;e Goths from Scandinavia about 300 years before Chri&s;t, whom Jornandes brings thence about 4000 years before Chri&s;t. But this hypothe&s;is is contradictory to all ancient ac|counts, as has been, and &s;hall be &s;hewn, in the cour&s;e of this tract; and de&s;erves laughter, not re|futation. Grotius is no authority at all; it is Jor|nandes who, from his antiquity, merits confutation from other authors yet more ancient and far better informed. Indeed &s;imply to a&s;k by what &s;pecial miracle Jornandes di&s;covered a matter not only unknown to, but contradictory of, all the ancients, would be full confutation in &s;uch a ca&s;e. He lived in no Augu&s;tan age when &s;cience was at its height; but in all the darkne&s;s of ignorance: and would not have even merited confutation, had he not mi&s;led &s;o many.</ITEM>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER III.</HI> The real origin, and fir&s;t progre&s;s, of the Scythians or Goths: and their Ea&s;tern Settlements.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already &s;een that the Scythian Empire, in pre&s;ent Per&s;ia, is the mo&s;t ancient of which hi&s;tory has pre&s;erved any memo|rial. This very curious &s;ubject &s;hall not be here enlarged on, but is left to &s;ome future Hi&s;torian of the Scythians. This empire &s;eems to have extended from Egypt to the Ganges; and from the Per&s;ian gulf, and Indian &s;ea, to the Ca&s;pian. The conque&s;ts of Bacchus, reputed a king of this Scythian dominion, in India, are famous in an|tiquity: he introduced the vine, or the u&s;e of wine, into his dominions, and was deified as the god of wine by his &s;ubjects. The bacchanalian fea&s;ts of the Thracians, and other Scythae, are noted by cla&s;&s;ic authors; and from the Thracians they are mentioned to have pa&s;t to the Greeks. The wine of barley, ale, &s;upplied the want of the grape; and Bacchus retained his honours. But, to enter more certain ground, the real Scythians of this original empire &s;eem to have been bounded by the Euphrates on the we&s;t, and the Indus on the ea&s;t. The Arabians, Syrians, &amp;c. were cer|tainly not Scythae. We find Indo-Scythae on the Indus, and other remains on the Erythraean &s;ea: but none beyond the Indo-Scythae. On the north the original Scythae extended to the Ca&s;pian. Due klowledge of this empire would remove tho&s;e em|barra&s;&s;ments
<PB N="33" REF="482" MS="y">which the learned have fallen into, from ancient accounts of the wars between the Scy|thae and Egyptians, while Scythia on the Euxine is &s;o remote from Egypt. Mo&s;t of the ancient authors only knowing Scythia on the Euxine, as the early &s;eat of the Scythae, have mi&s;repre&s;ented &s;ome of tho&s;e wars as carried on at &s;uch prodigious di&s;tance, while the fir&s;t Scythian empire really bordered on the Egyptian kingdom.</P>
<P>It has been &s;hewn above that eccle&s;ia&s;tic authors of chief account even regarded the Scythians as the very fir&s;t inhabitants of the ea&s;t after the deluge. If any reader inclines to look upon the deluge as fabulous<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>The late&s;t and be&s;t Natural Philo&s;ophers pronounce the flood impo&s;&s;ible; and their rea&s;ons, grounded on mathemati|cal truth and the immutable laws of nature, have my full a&s;&s;ent. The Jews believed the earth a va&s;t plain, and that the rain came from a collection of waters <HI>above</HI> the firmament, (<HI>Gene&s;.</HI> I. 7.) as the earth floated on another ma&s;s of waters; (<HI>Gen.</HI> VII. 11.) both of which were opened at the deluge. As &s;uch waters are now mathematically known not to exi&s;t; and the earth is found &s;pherical; the effect mu&s;t cea&s;e with the cau&s;e. M. de Buffon has &s;hewn that all the earth was at fir&s;t under &s;ea. And the opinion of a deluge, which Grotius <HI>(De Verit. Rel.

With their re&s;idence in Per&s;ia com|mences the fainte&s;t dawn of hi&s;tory: beyond, altho the period may amount to myriads of ages, there is nothing but profound darkne&s;s. It is a &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition, that the author of nature, as he formed great varieties in the &s;ame &s;pecies of plants, and of animals, &s;o he al&s;o gave various races of men as inhabitants of &s;everal countries. A Tartar, a Negro, an American, &amp;c. &amp;c. differ as much from a German, as a bull-dog, or lap-dog, or &s;hepherdd's cur, from a pointer.

<P>The Fir&s;t Progre&s;s of the Scythians was, as above &s;hewn from Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and other ancients, out of the north of pre&s;ent Per&s;ia, over the river Araxes, and the va&s;t moun|tains of Cauca&s;us, which run between the Euxine and Ca&s;pian &s;eas. And their fir&s;t grand &s;ettlement, after this emigration, was upon the ea&s;t, north, and we&s;t, of the Euxine, in the tract de&s;cribed as Ancient Scythia by Herodotus and many others; and which, including the northern half of the Euxine, formed, as Herodotus repre&s;ents, almo&s;t a &s;quare. A part of the Cimmerii, or ancient Celtic inhabitants of all Germany and up to the Euxine, naturally fortified in a corner of the Tauric Cher&s;one&s;e, by &s;urrounding waters, long with&s;tood the Scythians, or were neglected by them; and were not expelled till about 640 years before Chri&s;t, when pa&s;&s;ing the Cimmerian Bo&s;phorus, they made their way into A&s;ia over the mountains of Cauca&s;us. The Scythians pur&s;ued them, and again conquered great part of A&s;ia, but retained it only for about thirty years<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Herodot. lib. I. and IV. Diod. Sic. lib. II. &amp;c. It is remarkable that the &s;mall kingdom of the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> long main|tained it&s;elf in the &s;ame natural fortification. See a map of the Bo&s;phorus Cimmerius in Pey&s;onel.</NOTE>. This later expedition, &s;ome ancients have confounded with the fir&s;t Scythic empire.</P>
<P>But, if we except this &s;mall corner of the Tauric Cher&s;one&s;e, the Scythians may be regarded as po&s;&s;e&s;t of all ancient Scythia, at lea&s;t two thou&s;and years before Chri&s;t. Expelled from northern Per|&s;ia by Ninus, about 2200 years before our aera, they could not take more than two centuries to cover ancient Scythia, if their numbers did not fill it at fir&s;t. This will further appear from the progre&s;s
<PB N="35" REF="486" MS="y">of the Scythae, detailed in the re&s;t of this di&s;&s;er|tation.</P>
<P>From Scythia on the Euxine, which, with the antients, let us call Antient Scythia, as being the Parent Country of the European Scythians, the Scythae gradually extended to the Ea&s;t, around the northern &s;hores of the Ca&s;pian. Diony&s;ius, the geographer, v. 798, and other ancients, in&s;truct us that the regions, between the Euxine and Ca&s;pian, were all peopled by Scythae. <HI>Pontus</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Colchis received a colony of Egyptians about 1480 years before Chri&s;t; and Herodotus tells us, that the &s;peech and manners of the Colchians were Egyptian.

The Iberi here had, as plain &s;en&s;e might dictate, nothing in common with the Iberi of Spain, but the name; tho Strabo, i. 61. xv. 687, &s;ays they came from Spain, and Abydenus<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Apud. Eu&s;eb. preap. Evang. lib. ix, c. 41.</NOTE> fabled that Nebuchadnezzar, having &s;ubdued Afric and Spain, brought the&s;e Iberi from Spain. Appian<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In Ibericis, <HI>i. e.</HI> Hi&s;panicis, <HI>init.</HI></NOTE> tells us, in direct terms, that their language, man|ners, &amp;c. were totally different. They had in|deed no more connection than the Albani here with the
<Q>Albanique patres, et altae moenia Romae,</Q>
with Albania, the mountainous we&s;tern part of Macedon, or with the Albani or Highlanders of Scotland. Such coinciding names are mere falls of letters; and he, who builds any hypothe&s;is on them, as M. de Buat, and others, have done, &s;hould be taught to &s;tudy the etymology of Hellebore. But etymology, and &s;ingle words, and names, have converted the literature of the eighteenth century into a ti&s;&s;ue of vi&s;ions; and we daily &s;ee hi&s;tory built upon what no man of &s;ound mind would even
<PB N="36" REF="487" MS="y">build a fable. Solinus, c. 20, &s;ays, the Albani of A&s;iatic Scythia have white hair, blue eyes, and &s;ee better by night than by day. See al&s;o Pliny, VII. 2. Aul. Gell. ix. 4. Between the mouths of the Tanais and Rha were the <HI>Alani,</HI> a Scythic people, cele|brated in the <HI>Alanica</HI> of Arrian, and <HI>Toxaris</HI> of Lucian, who were generally leagued with the O&s;trogoths, and in time came to have &s;ettlements in Gaul and Spain. On the north of the Ca&s;pian, as appears from Herodotus, who did not, like Strabo, take the Ca&s;pian for a gulf of the Northern Ocean, were the MASSAGETAE, a great and renowned na|tion, who&s;e queen Thomyris &s;lew Cyrus, and de|&s;troyed his army. The Ma&s;&s;agetae extended to the ea&s;t of the Ca&s;pian; and they and the SACAE were the <HI>Scythae Intra Imaum,</HI> which Ptolemy begins from the Rha or Wolga on the we&s;t; as the <HI>Chatae,</HI> and fabulous <HI>Arima&s;pi,</HI> belonged to <HI>Scy|thia extra Imaum,</HI> which Ptolemy marks as a very narrow tract, and it certainly did not reach above two hundred miles to the ea&s;t of the Ca&s;pian.

For it is well known, that &s;ea coa&s;ts teem with progeny, owing to the inhabitants living on fi&s;h, a food at once &s;alacious and prolific; whence they, who love to moralize ancient fables, may well illu&s;trate the birth of Venus her&s;elf from the &s;ea. The Greeks, accu&s;tomed to a hot climate, regarded Ancient Scythia as very cold, for &s;uch ideas are comparative; an African regarding Italy as cold, an Italian France, a Frenchman Britain, a Briton Iceland. But plain rea&s;on dictates, that this country, from it's &s;ituation, mu&s;t be ble&s;t with a temperate cli|mate; and it's amazing vegetation, at pre&s;ent, de|clares this. Countries beyond the Sixtieth degree of latitude, in any part of the globe, are almo&s;t de&s;ert; nor can population thrive in &s;uch extreme cold. Ancient Scythia, lying between the For|tieth and Fiftieth degree, is in that happy tem|perature, between heat and cold, where philo&s;ophy, and actual ob&s;ervation, evince, that population is greate&s;t. Poland, a country bordering on Ancient Scythia, is the mo&s;t populous in Europe for it's &s;ize; and, were it not for a tyrannic government, and total depre&s;&s;ion of the people, would be twice as populous.

We read of battles on the ice of the Danube in Roman times; but that prodigious river was then &s;urrounded with enormous fore&s;ts, which &s;haded and chilled all around. It is believed al&s;o, that Ovid is the &s;ole witne&s;s of &s;uch battles, and we mu&s;t not take poetic exaggeration for &s;olid truth; e&s;pecially, &s;eeing the poet wi&s;hed to repre&s;ent the country in the mo&s;t dreadful colours, that he might, if po&s;&s;ible, procure a mitigation of his bani&s;hment. In England the Thames is often frozen, and yet the country is one of the mo&s;t fertile and populous in the world. Let us not therefore &s;hiver at Greek and Roman de&s;criptions of Thracian and of Scy|thian cold. Diony&s;ius, the Geographer, gives us, v. 666, to v. 679. of his Periege&s;is, a dreadful de&s;cription of the coldne&s;s, and &s;torms, of Ancient Scythia. "Where Tanais," &s;ays he, "rolls over the Scythian fields, the North Wind rages, and conden&s;es the ice. Unhappy they who build their huts around! For perpetual to them is &s;now, with the fro&s;ty gale. The hor&s;es, mules, and &s;heep, die before the piercing wind. Nor do men bear the bla&s;t unhurt; but fly on their cars to another region; leaving the land to the wintry winds, which, ru&s;hing with horrid uproar, &s;hake the fields, and piny hills." This poetic account of the cold, in the northern parts of Ancient Scythia, is merely comparative, between it, and Greece; and a Briti&s;h poet would, perhaps, as much ex|aggerate the heat of that country. The tempera|ture was &s;ingularly adapted to population; and, perhaps, as &s;ome kinds of animals are infinitely more prolific than others, &s;o al&s;o may certain races of men, as the Scythae, or Goths, undoubtedly were. This ancient Scythia was the real fountain of almo&s;t all European nations; and was &s;o e&s;teemed by the ancients, till the dreams of Jor|nandes, in a benighted age, a&s;cribed to a country

<P>If we place the reign of Ninus, as Chronologers do, about 2200 years before Chri&s;t, we may &s;up|po&s;e the Scythians, who retired from his power, to have been &s;ettled in Little or Ancient Scythia, extending down the &s;hores of the Euxine, to the mouth of the Danube, about 2000 years before Chri&s;t. Europe at that time, &s;eems to have been thinly inhabited by a few wandering Celts, who were to the Scythae, what the &s;avages of America are to the Europeans. The Sarmatae appear not then to have emerged from A&s;ia, that mother of nations, wi&s;dom, and arts; for the Scythae far preceded the Sarmatae in their progre&s;s.

But when the Celts arrived at the extremities, which was not for fifteen centuries, as the Scythae only enlarged their territories with their population, and con&s;equent nece&s;&s;ities, the Scy|thae had by a natural progre&s;s acquired more ad|vanced &s;ociety, and treated the Celts with &s;ome humanity.

It was the Pela&s;gic, but the Pela&s;gic refined, as the Engli&s;h is from the Saxon. No wonder that in Greece,

So that the old Pela&s;gic was, as might be expected, only to be found in &s;ome de|tached corners of Greece. And the&s;e &s;eparate Pela&s;gi were either &s;ome who had returned from Italy, after being defeated by the Aborigenes about the time of the Trojan war, if we credit Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us; or others who, according to Herodotus, had lately come from Samothrace. So that the&s;e &s;cattered fragments of Pela&s;gi mu&s;t not be confounded with the later Greeks, being only remnants of old colonies expelled from Italy, or late migrations of &s;mall parties from Thrace, the parent country of the Pela&s;gi; and that they re|tained their primitive barbaric &s;peech and manners, was a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of their late arrival from remote and uncultivated regions. This plain account at once reconciles all the Greek writers, who uniformly affert the whole Greeks to be Pela&s;gi, with the three above mentioned, who &s;tate &s;ome Pela&s;gi as different in manners, and &s;peech, from the refined Greeks. The&s;e later Pela&s;gi had lately come from Italy, and Samothrace, and retained their old &s;peech and manners: and this &s;ingularity puzzled Herodotus, who knew that, by all ac|counts, the Greeks were Pela&s;gi, as he him&s;elf re|peatedly

<P>Let us now con&s;ider very briefly,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Who the Pela&s;gi were not.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Who they were.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They were not Egyptians,</HI> BECAUSE all the Greek writers remark two &s;mall colonies of Egyp|tians, who &s;ettled in Athens and Argos in the ear|lie&s;t times, and &s;pecially di&s;tingui&s;h them as quite a different people from the Pela&s;gi. Be&s;ides, who can dream of Egyptians peopling all Hellas, the Iles, A&s;ia Minor, and entering Italy, as the
<PB N="65" REF="524">Pela&s;gi did, who were of barbaric &s;peech and manners, while the Egyptians were &s;o &s;mall and &s;o civilized a people? BECAUSE the Pela&s;gi had none of the Egyptian &s;peech and manners, el&s;e Homer and Herodotus, who had been in Egypt, would have remarked this. BECAUSE no ancient has ever dreamed of their being Egyptians and the ob&s;curity of the Pela&s;gic origin &s;hews they were quite a barbaric people, while the Egyptian co|lonies in Greece, and el&s;ewhere, are quite marked and di&s;tinct. BECAUSE the Greek mythology is as remote from the Egyptian as po&s;&s;ible. BECAUSE the Greek has no affinity with the Coptic or old Egyptian; which is a dialect of the Grand A&s;&s;y|rian language, while the Greek is a mere refined dialect of the Gothic, as the learned well know.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They were not Phoenicians,</HI> from all the rea|&s;ons above urged re&s;pecting the Egyptians. He|rodotus, <HI>lib.</HI> V. <HI>c.</HI> 58. &s;pecially mentions, that the Phoenician colony, led by Cadmus to Thebes, changed their &s;peech, being &s;urrounded by the Iones, whom he mentions as Pela&s;gi, and as Hel|lenes.</P>
<P>Such have been the origins a&s;cribed to the Pe|la&s;gi by &s;ome men of learning; and, did we not daily &s;ee that learning is but another name for want of common under&s;tanding, what mu&s;t be our &s;urprize to find the Pela&s;gi, whom all the ancients &s;tate as a barbaric people, derived from the Egyp|tians and Phoenicians, the nations in antiquity that arrived the fir&s;t at civilization, and whom the an|cients repre&s;ent as poli&s;hing tho&s;e very Pela&s;gi, by &s;ettling little colonies among them? Can ab&s;ur|dity be greater? A barbaric nation never can &s;pring from a refined one. It is an impo&s;&s;ibility. A refined nation always &s;prings from a barbaric one.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Memoires de l'Academie des In&s;criptions,</HI> a work replete with true and &s;olid literature, and
<PB N="66" REF="525" MS="y">which does honour to the nation that gave it birth, there is a di&s;&s;ertation of M. de la Nauze<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Tome XXIII.</NOTE>, at|tempting to &s;hew, that the Pela&s;gi and Hellenes were different nations. But that gentleman wrote upon a mere theory, without having employed one quarter of the &s;tudy he ought to have done, and the di&s;&s;ertations of M. Geinoz<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Tome XIV.</NOTE>, and of M. Freret<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Tome XXI.</NOTE>, &s;o amply refute him, as to leave nothing to add.

The former, I am convinced, was the ancient kingdom of Argos. See Homer's Iliad II. The ancient kingdom of Sicyon, as &s;tated by Eu&s;ebius, is a vi&s;ion unknown to earlier writers. Danaus, an Egyptian, founded the kingdom of Argos in Peloponne&s;us after the termination of the old kingdom of Argos in Pela&s;gia.</P></NOTE>, and, of cour&s;e, as originating in Pelo|ponne&s;us. This Pela&s;gus is only mentioned in a ver&s;e of He&s;iod, pre&s;erved by Strabo; and the&s;e authors &s;eized the name as a good father for the Pela&s;gi: but he is a mere being of poetry, and the three authors, who follow this opinion, are of fabulous fame. Diony&s;ius telling us all the bat|tles, &amp;c. between the Pela&s;gi and Aborigines in Italy, as a matter of ye&s;terday, while he had not a &s;hadow of ground for one &s;entence on the &s;ub|ject. To oppo&s;e &s;uch writers to Herodotus, Thucy|dides, and the other mo&s;t eminent names of Greek antiquity, is therefore ridiculous; and M. Geinoz, and M. Freret, have amply &s;hewn that the Pela&s;gi came from Thrace.</P>
<P>But, had the Grecian origins been ever exa|mined with much attention, there are two barbaric nations who might, with far higher probability than Egyptians or Phoenicians, have been &s;up|po&s;ed the progenitors of the Pela&s;gi, or Greeks.
<PB N="67" REF="526">The&s;e are the Celts and the Sarmatians. Yet the Pela&s;gi belonged not to either of the&s;e nations.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They were not Celts,</HI> BECAUSE they can be ab&s;olutely &s;hewn to be Scythians; a people who originated from the ea&s;t, as the Celts did from the we&s;t. BECAUSE the earlie&s;t Greek writers de&s;cribe the Celts as confined to the furthe&s;t we&s;t; whereas Greece was &s;urrounded by Scythae. BECAUSE the very form and &s;tructure of the Celtic tongue are as remote from the Greek as po&s;&s;ible; the Celts changing the beginning of nouns in many in|flexions, while the Greeks uniformly change the end. What we now call the Celtic is half Gothic; owing to the Belgae, Danes, and Norwegians, be|ing mixt with all the Celtae in France, Britain, and Ireland; but e&s;pecially in the Highlands of Scot|land, where the Celtic is the mo&s;t corrupt, becau&s;e the Norwegians were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Hebrides, and we&s;tern coa&s;t, from the reign of Harold Har|fagre, about 880, till &s;o late as 1263, and their de&s;cendants remain to this day. The words, thought Greek by dablers in the Celtic, are all Gothic<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><P>To derive Latin words from Celtic is a &s;ure mark of a Celtic under&s;tanding, which always judges by the inver&s;e ratio of rea&s;on, for the words pa&s;&s;ed into Wel&s;h from the Romans; and into Iri&s;h from Chri&s;tianity, who&s;e offices and prayers, &amp;c. were all Latin. The roots are all in the Latin, not in the Celtic.</P></NOTE>. But the real Celtic is as remote from the Greek, as the Hottentot, or the Laplandic. BECAUSE the manners of the Celts, as de&s;cribed by Greek and Roman authors, are totally unlike tho&s;e of the earlie&s;t Greeks; the people among the former being &s;laves, among the later extremely free. Dr. Gillies has &s;hewn that the mo&s;t ancient Greek man|ners perfectly re&s;embled tho&s;e of the Germans, which Cae&s;ar and Tacitus mark as being as unlike tho&s;e of the Celts as po&s;&s;ible. Of the Celtic my|thology we know nothing: the Druidic &s;y&s;tem being mentioned by Cae&s;ar as a late invention, con|fined
<PB N="68" REF="527" MS="y">to the &s;outh of Britain and north of Gaul: and it is clear from all the ancients, that it was no where el&s;e to be found. It was totally extingui&s;hed by Tiberius Pliny XXX. 1.&mdash;Suetonius in <HI>Claudio,</HI> and Aurelius Victor, &s;ay by Claudius. It is palpa|bly of Phoenician origin, having been taught by the Phoenicians to the Britons of pre&s;ent Cornwall, where they traded for tin; and had thence &s;pred north to the extremity of pre&s;ent Wales, and &s;outh to the Garonne; beyond which bounds there is not a &s;hadow of it's exi&s;tence in any ancient writer whatever. They who &s;peak of Druids in Germany, Caledonia, or Ireland, &s;peak utter non&s;en&s;e, and have not a &s;ingle authority to &s;upport them. <HI>Druid,</HI> in the Celtic, implies originally a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> or <HI>cunning man;</HI> and the name was naturally given by the rude vulgar to the prie&s;ts of the new doctrine: but the name will be found in it's original mean|ing where Druids never were known. Druidic an|tiquities there can be none, except there be any oak-trees two thou&s;and years old. Tho&s;e childi&s;hly called Druidic are all Gothic; and are found in Iceland, and other countries, where the very name of Druid was unknown. The Celts had no monuments any more than the &s;avage Americans or Samoiedes. From Diodorus Siculus, and others, it is clear that the manners of the Celts perfectly re&s;embled tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent Hottentots. The god <HI>Baal, Bell,</HI> or <HI>Belenus;</HI> the tran&s;migration of &s;ouls; their co&s;mogony and theogony are wholly Phoenician: what their own mythology was we know not, but it in all probability re&s;embled that of the Hottentots, or others of the rude&s;t &s;avages, as the Celts anciently were, and are little better at pre&s;ent, being inca|pable of any progre&s;s in &s;ociety. But it is un|nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t further upon this, as the Pela&s;gi can be &s;hewn to be Scythae; and M. Pelloutier, who alone takes them for Celts, clearly proves them Scythae, that is, as he dreams, Celts; for he was &s;o
<PB N="69" REF="528" MS="y">ignorant as to take the Celts and Scythae for one people, in &s;pite of all the ancients who mark them as literally <HI>toto coelo</HI> different, and in &s;pite of our po&s;itive knowledge here in Britain, who know the Celts to be mere radical &s;avages, not yet ad|vanced even to a &s;tate of barbari&s;m; and if any foreigner doubts this, he has only to &s;tep into the Celtic part of Wales, Ireland, or Scotland, and look at them, for they are ju&s;t as they were, inca|pable of indu&s;try or civilization, even after half their blood is Gothic, and remain, as marked by the ancients, fond of lyes, and enemies of truth<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><P>It is to the lyes of our Celtic neighbours, that we are in|debted for the fables of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory down to within the&s;e thirty years, and the almo&s;t total perdition of the hi&s;tory of Scot|land and Ireland. Geofrey of Monmouth, mo&s;t of the Iri&s;h hi&s;torians, and the Highland bards, and &s;enachies of Scotland, &s;hew that fal&s;ehood is the natural product of the Celtic mind: and the ca&s;e is the &s;ame to this day. No reprobation can be too &s;evere for the&s;e frontle&s;s impo&s;tors: and to &s;ay that a writer is a Celt, is to &s;ay, that he is a &s;tranger to truth, mode&s;ty, and morality.

BECAUSE the manners of the earlie&s;t Greeks, as de&s;cribed by Homer, were totally unlike the Sarmatic; and e&s;pecially in that
<PB N="70" REF="529">grand feature, that the Sarmatae were, like the Tar|tars, all cavalry; while the Greeks fought on foot, and in cars; and we know the later to be peculi|arly Scythic, Philip having in his Scythic victory taken a va&s;t number of cars<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ju&s;tin, <HI>lib.</HI> IX. c. 2.

From the Greek authors above adduced it is clear that all the Greeks were originally called Pela&s;gi; but that the Hellenes, originally a &s;mall tribe in The&s;&s;aly, being the la&s;t of the Pela&s;gi who came into Achaia, or Le&s;&s;er Greece, they by a chance equal to that of the name of America, and many other great names, gave their appellation to the whole country. Some late Greek fables &s;ay that Pela&s;gus, the grand&s;on of Inachus, king of Argos, from whom, as they fal&s;ely &s;tate, the name Pela&s;gi is derived, lived before the deluge of Deucalion, by which mo&s;t of the Pela&s;gi were &s;wept away. Hellen, the &s;on of Deucalion, proceeded with fre&s;h recruits of Pela&s;gi into Greece: and the Greeks in gratitude took his name, and a&s;cribed the renewal of human kind to Deucalion. But Herodotus, Thucydides, and others of the be&s;t Greek authors, knew nothing of this; they repre &s;enting the very &s;ame identic people as being fir&s;t called Pela&s;gi, then Hellenes. In Homer's time (II. &szlig; 683) Hellas was a town of Pela&s;gic Argos. To prevent all doubt, however, let us fir&s;t &s;hew that the Pela&s;gi were Scythae; and then that the Hellenes were Scythae.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Pela&s;gi were Scythae.</HI> This may be &s;hewn from different arguments, tho the Greek writers have &s;haded the &s;ubject much by the fooli&s;h de&s;ire of making their nation aboriginal, or &s;prung from the ground on which they lived. It is a pity they &s;aw not &s;o far as the philo&s;opher Anti&s;thenes, who u&s;ed to tell the Athenians that &s;uch prai&s;e belonged to &s;nails, and not to men. But that the Pela&s;gi were Scythae appears from this, that they certainly de&s;cended from the north-ea&s;t into Greece; and the Scythae &s;pred over all the&s;e parts. For we
<PB N="72" REF="531">find &s;ettlements of the Pela&s;gi on the Helle&s;pont: and in The&s;&s;aly, a country to the north-ea&s;t of Greece, a large country was &s;pecially called Pela&s;gia in the days of Homer, and far later. Trogus Pompeius, in Ju&s;tin, <HI>lib.</HI> VII. <HI>c.</HI> I, &s;ays expre&s;&s;ly, that the people of Macedon were an|ciently called Pela&s;gi. Strabo, <HI>lib.</HI> VII. <HI>p.</HI> 222, &s;ays that the Thracians under Eumolpus colonized Attica; and Herodotus calls the&s;e Thracians, Pela&s;gi, as above &s;hewn. Plutarch in Romulo &s;ays, <GAP DESC="foreign">: 'The Pela&s;gi, as they &s;ay, roving over the greate&s;t part of the world, and having &s;ubdued the inhabitants, re&s;ided in the country which they had conquered.' This can only refer to the Scythae. Pau&s;anias, <HI>lib.</HI> X. <HI>c.</HI> 5, &s;hews the oracle at Delphi to have been founded by Scythae Hyperborei; and ancient Greek poets al&s;o call it <HI>Pela&s;gic.</HI> Inachus, the fir&s;t fabulous king of the Pela&s;gi, is by &s;ome mythologi&s;ts &s;aid to have come into Greece by &s;ea. But i am con|vinced that this idea aro&s;e &s;olely from the &s;imilarity of the words <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the &s;ea,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> a <HI>Pela&s;|gian,</HI> tho the later word be probably from <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>overwhelm,</HI> becau&s;e the Pela&s;gi over-ran &s;o many countries; or more probably from &s;ome A&s;&s;yrian (Egyptian or Phoenician) epithet given to the old inhabitants by the few Egyptians and Phoenicians who &s;ettled among them; if it be not a Scythic or Gothic appellative. Indeed we cannot be too cautious again&s;t being mi&s;led by etymology, or by &s;imilar or identic words; for in early and tradi|tional hi&s;tory they form the very rocks and &s;ands upon which many an antiquarian &s;hip has foundered. And the danger is &s;o great, that it is be&s;t never even to approach them.</P>
<P>Ihre is &s;o convinced that the Pela&s;gi were Scythae, that he &s;eems to think the point does not even need proofs; yet it were to be wi&s;hed that he had dwelt
<PB N="73" REF="532">more upon &s;o very intere&s;ting and curious a &s;ub|ject. Herodotus, Thucydides, Strabo, a&s;&s;ert the Pela&s;gi to have come from The&s;&s;aly into Greece; and The&s;&s;aly was anciently e&s;teemed a part of Thrace, &s;o that the Pela&s;gi were Thracians, that is, Scythae, Getae or Goths.</P>
<P>The term <HI>Hellas,</HI> or <HI>Greece,</HI> is differently extended by writers; &s;ome excluding Macedon and Epirus from it, as Demo&s;thenes, <HI>Philip.</HI> III. The Hellenes or Greeks, &s;everely &s;peaking, were Pela&s;gi who went from Macedon, anciently called Pela&s;gia, as Trogus &s;hews, down into Greece proper. That Epirus was al&s;o inhabited by Pela&s;gi is clear, for Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;aeus makes the Pela&s;gi of Italy pa&s;s from Epirus, and the celebrated oracle of Dodona, called Pela&s;gic, was in the extreme north of Epirus. It is well known that the Epirian and Macedonian language was the Doric dialect of Greek. So that, excluding Macedon and Epirus from Hellas or Greece, the argument is the &s;ame. Ancient Pela&s;gia included Macedon, Epirus; and afterward that part in later times called Hellas, or Greece. Perhaps the Thracians who filled this cher&s;one&s;e were called Pela&s;gi by their northern brethren, becau&s;e every where &s;urrounded by the &s;ea <HI>(Pelagos),</HI> &s;ave on the north.</P>
<P>But as it is now univer&s;ally allowed by the learned that Pela&s;gi and Hellenes were but differ|ent names for one and the &s;ame people, let us pro|ceed to &s;hew that the Hellences, anciently called Pela&s;gi, were Scythae.

<P>From all the&s;e proofs, it is as clear as &s;o remote a &s;ubject can be, that the Pela&s;gi, the ance&s;tors of the Greeks, afterward called Hellenes from a &s;mall tribe of the Pela&s;gi who were the la&s;t that came in, were at fir&s;t &s;ettled in Macedon and The&s;&s;aly.

<P><HI>It is therefore Hi&s;toric Truth that the Pela&s;gi, Hellenes, or Greeks, were Scythians or Goths.</HI></P>
<P>Chronologers place the reign of Inachus, the fir&s;t of the Pela&s;gic &s;tem, about 1800 years before Chri&s;t: and Deucalion and Hellen about 1500. But the Argonautic expedition 1263 before Chri&s;t forms the fir&s;t faint dawn even of traditional hi&s;tory in Greece; all preceding this belonging to mytho|logy. The Siege of Thebes 1225, and that of Troy 1184, together with that expedition, are the immortal themes of poets; but fairy ground to hi&s;torians. The revolution cau&s;ed by the Hera|clidae in Peloponne&s;us, 1104, is blended with my|thology. And from thence down to Lycurgus, or about 880 before our aera, hardly an incident can be found. If we therefore &s;uppo&s;e the Scythae to have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Greece and it's iles about 1500 years before Chri&s;t, we &s;hall not greatly err. Tho the kingdom of Pela&s;gic Argos in The&s;&s;aly, the earlie&s;t in Greece, may well have exi&s;ted 300 years before this population was complete, as chro|nologers &s;tate it about 1800 B. C.</P>
<P>The Pela&s;gi, afterward called Hellenes, were improved by the &s;ituation of Greece, their new &s;ettlement: for that favoured country, &s;urrounded every where by the &s;ea, &s;ave on the north, proved an attractive centre to &s;mall colonies from Egypt, and from Phoenicia, realms famous for early civili|zation. Cecrops and Danaus, who &s;ettled in
<PB N="77" REF="538">Athens and Argos, about 1400 years before Chri&s;t, were Egyptians: Cadmus, who about 1280, founded Thebes, was a Phoenician. Letters be|gan to be u&s;ed<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>Diodorus Sic. <HI>lib.</HI> III. and Pau&s;an. <HI>in Attic.</HI> &s;hew, that the Greeks had letters before Cadmus; and that the Pela&s;gic, or real ancient Greek alphabet, differed from the Phoenician. An antiquary will find re&s;emblances in things wholly unlike: but the ancient Greek alphabet is not Phoenician. The in|vention of letters, &s;o ridiculou&s;ly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, is the mo&s;t &s;imple po&s;&s;ible: and at lea&s;t a dozen nations have all invented letters. It is the common u&s;e of letters that attends civilized &s;ociety. The invention may belong to the rude&s;t. Plato witne&s;&s;es that the Scythae had letters; and the Pela&s;gic or Greek were &s;urely Scythic. Of Scythic letters &s;ee al&s;o Eu&s;tathius in II. &zgr;.</P></NOTE>. Cecrops and Danaus had, it is likely, introduced tillage from the practice of Egypt; a country unfit for hunting or pa&s;turage, and where, from nece&s;&s;ity, &s;owing of grain &s;eems fir&s;t to have been invented<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">So Diony&s;. Perieg. v. 234.</NOTE>. Thus Egyptian agriculture, and the arts of Phoenicia, &s;oon po|li&s;hed this branch of the Scythae, while their northern brethren were lo&s;t in barbari&s;m. But the&s;e colonies adopted the Pela&s;gic or Hellenic lan|guage; and conformed to the Pela&s;gic or Hellenic rites, and cu&s;toms; as Dr. Gillies &s;hews from the be&s;t authorities, particularly Herodot. V. 59. and VII. <HI>pa&s;&s;im.</HI> Herodotus e&s;pecially mentions V. 58. that the followers of Cadmus changed their &s;peech, being &s;urrounded by the Ionians an Hellenic tribe. And it might be &s;hewn that the Greek mythology is but an improvement of the Scythic; the gods being mo&s;tly illu&s;trious princes of the fir&s;t Scythic empire, who were deified by their &s;ubjects; a cu&s;tom continued to a late period among the Goths. Many ideas of Greek mythology may al&s;o be found in the Gothic; but this ground mu&s;t not be lightly trodden, and is left to him who can em|ploy a large work upon it, after a remark or two. It is well known, that the mo&s;t ancient Greek poets were the &s;ole teachers of the people, and were the fir&s;t who, by introducing a portion of
<PB N="78" REF="539" MS="y">allegory and an elegant method into vulgar tradi|tion and &s;uper&s;tition, compo&s;ed regular &s;y&s;tems of theogony and mythology. Now, the&s;e earlier poets and teachers of religion were all of Thrace. Linus, Orpheus, Mu&s;aeus, Thamyris, Eumolpus, were all Thracians; and Eu&s;tathius (<GAP DESC="foreign">) has long ago ob&s;erved this &s;ingularity. If Thra|cians, they were Scythians or Goths: if Scythians, they could only u&s;e Scythic mythology and tradi|tions. For the religions of the Sarmatae, of the Celts, of the Phoenicians, of the Egyptians, were quite remote from the Grecian. Blackwell, in his admirable Enquiry into the life and writings of Homer (Sect. xii.), has well concluded the lan|guage of Thrace and of Greece to have been the &s;ame; and e&s;pecially quotes Strabo, who was of Colchis, and who &s;ays, 'that the Trojan language had many words and names in common with the Thracian.' The &s;everal in&s;tances he produces are, as Blackwell ob&s;erves, generally known Grecian terms, as well as Trojan or Thracian: even the others may have been ancient Grecian, tho unfit for poetry, the only repo&s;itory of Greek language till Herodotus wrote, or about 450 years before Chri&s;t. Herodotus, <HI>lib.</HI> II. c. 52. &s;ays, the Greeks derived their rites and religion from the Pela&s;gi, who were certainly Scythae of Southern Thrace. Anachar&s;is, as above ob&s;erved, &s;aid, the Greeks <HI>&s;cythici&s;ed,</HI> or followed the cu&s;toms, &amp;c. of the Scythae. The Titans, or family of gods, were of Scythia, as mythologi&s;ts agree. Plato <HI>in Cratylo</HI> &s;ays, the Greek rites are all from the barbarians; that is, as ju&s;t &s;hewn, the barbarians of Thrace.</P>
<P>The Greeks, fermented into purity by foreign colonies, &s;oon a&s;&s;umed quite a di&s;tinct character from their Scythian progenitors and neighbours. Homer al&s;o ro&s;e from the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Egean, like the &s;un, upon them; and diffu&s;ed an intellectual light and warmth which made their &s;ouls vegetate with great thoughts, the &s;tems of
<PB N="79" REF="540">great actions. So early as about 1000 years before Chri&s;t Grecian colonies began to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in Magna Graecia or the &s;outh of Italy, in Sicily, in Africa. Nay in Macedon and Thrace, and among the more di&s;tant Scythae, in which later countries, for want of tillage and the arts, barbari&s;m was long to prevail: while, owing to fortunate circum&s;tances above mentioned, the Greeks had admitted &s;uch refinement as almo&s;t to pa&s;s for another people among their own progenitors. A ca&s;e which may even happen in ruder nations, as we know that the Danes, who came to Northumberland in the Ninth century, were regarded as utter &s;trangers and enemies by their own countrymen the Angli, who in 547 had &s;ettled in that province.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Let us now very briefly con&s;ider the origins of the ITALIANS, or whole ancient inhabitants of Italy. This country in its early &s;tate may be re|garded as divided into four parts:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Graecia Magna, and the whole country &s;outh-we&s;t of the Apennines up to Hetruria.</ITEM>

<ITEM>5. Hetruria.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Gallic part, from the Alps down to the Senones in Umbria.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The fir&s;t part, as appears from Diony&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us, was peopled by Aborigines from Arcadia, the earlie&s;t inhabitants that can be traced of Magna Graecia and of Latium. Diony&s;ius mentions that &s;ome Pela&s;gi afterwards went over; but it is clear that the Arcadians were Pela&s;gi<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"> Herodot. VII. See al&s;o Pau&s;an. in Arcad. and Cumberland, Orig. Gent.</NOTE>, and M. Freret accordingly &s;hews that the Abori|gines and Pela&s;gi were all one people. The learned look with a &s;u&s;picious eye upon the pages of Diony&s;ius, who only wrote about thirty years before Chri&s;t, and yet details battles, &s;peeches, emba&s;&s;ies, &amp;c. between the Pela&s;gi and Abori|gines, as matters of ye&s;terday; while Herodotus
<PB N="80" REF="541" MS="y">and the other ancient Greek writers knew almo&s;t nothing of Italy, and Diony&s;ius had not one au|thority. But it appears, that the Pela&s;gi, whom Diony&s;ius feigns to have fought with the Abori|gines, but to have been vanqui&s;hed and expelled by them, were &s;ome few later Pela&s;gi from Epirus. Sicily, and this part of Italy, were afterward planted with &s;uch numerous Greek colonies, from about 700 years before Chri&s;t, and downward, that they may be almo&s;t &s;aid to be peopled afre&s;h. In Latium, where Rome was founded, there were &s;everal little tribes and towns of the Aborigines, as the Sabines, Vol&s;ci, &amp;c. Sir I&s;aac Newton in his Chronology, has actually demon&s;trated that Romulus could not exi&s;t till at lea&s;t 125 years after the vulgar aera, or the year 627 before Chri&s;t. For to the &s;even kings are given no le&s;s than 243 years! And of the&s;e &s;even kings three were mur|dered, and one expelled! In no hi&s;tory, ancient or modern, will &s;uch reigns of &s;even kings amount to 140 years, much le&s;s to 243. But as the <HI>Annus Urbis Conditoe</HI> is followed by the Roman writers, it would be mo&s;t eligible to &s;uppo&s;e, with &s;ome an|cients, that Romulus did not found Rome; but that the city was a rude republick, with elective chiefs, for &s;ome time before Romulus. However this be, the Latin language is a clear proof of the origin of the people, being merely the Aeolic dia|lect of the Greek, as Quintilian remarks, and as the learned well know. This Aeolic has but a few variations from the Doric; as the Ionic has but a few variations from the Attic. The Aeolians, a Pela&s;gic divi&s;ion, peopled Elis and Arcadia, or the we&s;tern and inland parts of Peloponne&s;us, which confims the account of Diony&s;ius, that the Aborigines went from the&s;e parts. The Dorians, another Pela&s;gic or Hellenic divi&s;ion, held all the northwe&s;t or mountainous part of Greece; and being led into Peloponne&s;us by the Heraclidae, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Argos, Sparta, &amp;c.

<PB N="82" REF="545" MS="y">Ionic variations, is the Greek language u&s;ed by all their writers but the&s;e above mentioned: and can no more be called a dialect than the Engli&s;h is a dialect of the Engli&s;h. The Doric, Aeolic, or old Greek, was &s;poken in Macedon, Epirus, Italy, Sicily, and over all Greece, &s;ave Attica. But the Attic, from &s;uperior poli&s;h, became the reigning language, while in time the other was univer&s;ally left to clowns: and the Attic is the Greek of all countries and authors. Homer and Herodotus, A&s;iatic Greeks, wrote in Ionic or A&s;ia|tic Greek, that is the Attic rendered more mu&s;ical by now and then dropping a con&s;onant or a&s;perate, and adding a vowel, &amp;c. Doric or Aeolic is &s;ometimes &s;paringly intermixed by &s;ome writers as the dialect of their country ran, or to add antique dignity. Milton and Shak&s;pere are full of &s;uch Doric Engli&s;h. But of this perhaps more largely el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The part of Italy, north of the Apennines, and oppo&s;ite to Illyricum, was, as plain rea&s;on would argue, peopled by Illyrians, who, as &s;hewn, were Scythae. Pliny III. 25, tells us, that Cal|limachus placed a people called Peuketi<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The Roman <HI>c</HI> being the Greek <HI>x,</HI> and ever pronounced &s;o, it is put <HI>k</HI> in the&s;e proper names for the &s;ake of the Engli&s;h reader.</NOTE> in Li|burnia of Illyricum. In Italy directly on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore were the Pikeni; and further &s;outh lay the large country of Peuketia, now Apulia, of which much may be found in Strabo. The Peu|keti of Liburnia were certainly a part of the Peu|kini or Ba&s;ternae, a Scythic divi&s;ion, who had &s;pred from Thrace into Illyricum, and Germany; and of whom is fully treated in the la&s;t chapter of this tract.</P>
<P>The Hetrurians, as we learn from Herodotus, whom Pliny, Paterculus, and other of the be&s;t ancient writers follow, were a Lydian colony; a
<PB N="83" REF="546">circum&s;tance not improbable, if we con&s;ider the great riches, and wide commerce of Lydia. Dio|ny&s;ius of Halicarna&s;&s;us, a fabulous hi&s;torian, tells us, that the Hetru&s;cans were a peculiar indigenal people, re&s;embling no other nation in &s;peech or manners. He informs us that the Hetru&s;can &s;peech was not Pela&s;gic, in the mo&s;t expre&s;s terms: and yet the learned univer&s;ally allow the Hetru&s;can letters, and antiquities, to be Pela&s;gic, or Ancient Grecian. Indeed tho&s;e few detached barbaric Pela&s;gi, who had returned into Greece from Italy, and tho&s;e who had come from Samothrace, quire puzzled Herodotus, and Diony&s;ius; ju&s;t as if a few Angli from Anglen had, in the ninth or tenth century, come to England, and the writers of the times had been a&s;toni&s;hed at their &s;peech not being Anglic, but Dani&s;h. The number of books, of all ages and languages, gives the moderns a prodigious &s;u|periority over the ancients, in judging of the gra|dations of &s;peech, and origin and progre&s;s of na|tions. From the ancient Hetru&s;can in&s;criptions, and other monuments, the learned pronounce them Pela&s;gi, looking on Diony&s;ius as no autho|rity again&s;t facts. But may we not tru&s;t the well informed Herodotus that they were Lydians, who about 1000 years before our aera planted Etruria? For the Lydians, as above &s;hewn, were Scythae of Thrace, as were the Pela&s;gi: &s;o that a &s;imilarity in their ancient remains may be expected. The Lydians were early poli&s;hed, from their neighbour|hood with the A&s;&s;yrians of Cappadocia; and were probably &s;omewhat mixt with them, &s;o as to tinge their dialect a little, whence the error of Diony&s;ius. They were a poli&s;hed and opulent people: and the Hetru&s;cans &s;eem to have had &s;kill in the fine arts long before the Latins, as the many ancient pieces pre&s;erved &s;hew: a circum&s;tance appearing to con|firm the account of Herodotus that they were a Lydian colony. By the te&s;timony of Herodotus therefore the Hetru&s;cans were Lydians, or Scythae:
<PB N="84" REF="547" MS="y">by their monuments they were Pela&s;gi, or Scythae. At any rate they were vanqui&s;hed, and their coun|try almo&s;t peopled afre&s;h by the Romans, a Gre|cian, Pela&s;gic, or Scythic nation.</P>
<P>The Gallic part of Italy alone remains. The Gauls were the late&s;t &s;ettlers in Italy. It was 386 years before our aera that they took Rome, but were defeated by Camillus.

<P>It will be &s;hewn in the Second Part that the Scythae had pa&s;t to the extremity of Germany and Scandinavia, about 500 years before Chri&s;t. On the &s;outh of Germany they extended to the extre|mity of Illyricum, and entered Gaul on that &s;ide before that period. The Scythae who peopled Illyricum were of the Thracian divi&s;ion, &s;eparated from the Germans by the Danube; and as the &s;ame divi&s;ion extended, as ju&s;t &s;hewn, into Greece and Italy, their population was wholly occupied by the&s;e countries, and their A&s;iatic &s;ettlements; &s;o that, pre&s;&s;ing to the ea&s;t and &s;outh, they never extended beyond the Adriatic, where they were checked by the Alps. The Celts &s;eem to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all their territories beyond the Adriatic, including Ci&s;alpine Gaul, till about 500 years before Chri&s;t, when the Germans arrived, and poured into the north of Italy, and the ea&s;t, and &s;outh of Gaul; the Celts flying before them to the we&s;t. But as the Celts were called Gauls by the

But this the reader will find more fully treated when we come to the Germans.

<P>WE are now arrived at the la&s;t, and mo&s;t im|portant part of this Di&s;&s;ertation: and a &s;ubject upon which the whole modern hi&s;tory or Europe depends. Sen&s;ible of its prodigious weight, i &s;hall examine it with all the &s;edulous care, and minute accuracy, which my purpo&s;e per|mits. The theme is indeed &s;o va&s;t, that large vo|lumes may be written on it; but tho my bounds confine me to the mere outline; yet all attention &s;hall be paid to render it &s;crupulou&s;ly exact, &s;o as to enable the reader to form, as from a miniature drawing, a true and ju&s;t idea of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="552" MS="y">The Scythians or Goths have been followed to their Ea&s;tern Settlements in A&s;ia, and to their Southern in Europe. Let us now trace their We&s;tern progre&s;s, or that of our progenitors. If Engli&s;h, Scoti&s;h, Iri&s;h; if French, Spaniard, Italian, German, Dutch, Swi&s;s, Swede, or Dane, let the reader attend with reverence, as he per&s;ues the &s;acred &s;teps of his ance&s;tors. Here every Eu|ropean is per&s;onally intere&s;ted, &s;ave the Sarma|tians of Ru&s;&s;ia and Poland; &s;ave the Celto-Welch of England, and the Celt-Iri&s;h of Ireland and of the Highlands of Scotland; and &s;ave the Fins of Hungary, Finland, and Lapland.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect that the Getae, who extended all over the we&s;t of the Euxine, are &s;hewn to have been the &s;ame identic people with the Parental Scythians or Goths. On the North-We&s;t the Ba&s;ternae, a German nation, as Pliny and Tacitus &s;hew, bordered on the Getae. On the South-We&s;t that divi&s;ion of the Getae, called Daci, bordered with Germany. Pliny, IV. 12. &s;ays, <HI>Getae, Daci Romanis dicti,</HI> 'tho&s;e Getae called Daci by the Romans.' Strabo, <HI>lib.</HI> VIII. <GAP DESC="foreign">; 'the Getae and Daci have one and the &s;ame &s;peech.' Steph. <HI>de Urbibus,</HI> al&s;o &s;ays the Daci are the &s;ame with the Getae: and to this all antient and modern writers a&s;&s;ent. Therefore the Germans bordered, on the Ea&s;t, with the Getae or Parental Goths. So Pliny VIII. 15. <HI>Germania Scythiae contermina.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we are come to the very cri&s;is of our re|&s;earch. If we cannot &s;hew the Germans to have been originally Scythae, this di&s;&s;ertation is inept. If we can, a field of wide curio&s;ity and enquiry opens to the learned of Europe. For the origin of government, manners, laws, in &s;hort, all the antiquities of Europe, will a&s;&s;ume a new appear|ance; and in&s;tead of being only traced to the woods of Germany, as Monte&s;quieu, and the
<PB N="91" REF="553">greate&s;t writers have hitherto done, may be fol|lowed thro the long de&s;criptions of the man|ners, &amp;c. of the Scythians and Thracians given us by Herodotus. Nay, even up to the Abori|ginal Scythic empire in Per&s;ia, beyond which there is no memorial of human affairs, &s;ave in Egypt alone; the hi&s;tory of which begins with Menes the fir&s;t king, about 4000 years before our aera; while the earlie&s;t appearance of the Scythians in hi&s;tory is about 400 years after, when Vexores was king of Egypt, and Tanaus of the Scythae. Not to mention the collateral light to be derived from the whole hi&s;tory of the Greeks and Romans, who were Scythae, as ju&s;t &s;hewn.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>The Germans not Sarmatae.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e opinions, namely, that the Germans were Sar|matae, proceeds from &s;uch gro&s;s ignorance that i am really a&s;hamed to mention, much more to re|fute it. I have diligently peru&s;ed mo&s;t writers on German antiquities, but they had all &s;ome degree of reading, and could never fall into an error, which the whole ancient authors, and complete modern knowlege, concur to refute. This un|happy di&s;covery mu&s;t therefore be a&s;&s;igned to its right owner, and inventor, James Macpher&s;on, E&s;q. in who&s;e Introduction to the Hi&s;tory of Great Britain it <HI>fir&s;t</HI> occurs. The author of that &s;trange
<PB N="92" REF="554">and truly Celtic work, having, with that over|heated ra&s;hne&s;s, which genius colliding with per|fect ignorance can alone in&s;pire, attempted to in|troduce the mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;ed dreams into the Hi&s;tory of Scotland, thought he could, behind his Celtic mi&s;t, u&s;e equal freedoms with the hi&s;tory of Eu|rope! Ra&s;h man, and ill advi&s;ed! The mi&s;t of Celtic non&s;en&s;e he may gild with the beams of real genius; but, with the ignorance of a &s;chool-boy, to write on the antiquities of the Germans, in which the learned of all Europe had been ever conver&s;ant, was deplorable indeed, and worthy of eternal laughter, did not commi&s;eration for the in|genious tran&s;lator and compo&s;er of Iri&s;h poetry move every reader to gentlene&s;s. At the &s;ame time it is much &s;u&s;pected that his motives entitle him to no excu&s;e: and the high and contemptuous manner in which he treats others annuls all fa|vour. His O&s;&s;ian &s;hews that he piques him&s;elf greatly on being a Celt, and will not admit the Engli&s;h, or French, or Germans, or other paltry modern nations, to that high honour! Indeed the malice and contempt borne by the Celtic &s;a|vages; for they are &s;avages, have been &s;avages &s;ince the world began, and will be for ever &s;avages while a &s;eparate people; that is, while them&s;elves, and of unmixt blood; i &s;ay the contempt borne by tho&s;e Celts for the Engli&s;h, Lowland Scots, and later Iri&s;h (who are Engli&s;h and Scots), is extreme and knows no bounds. Mr. Macpher&s;on knew that his own dear Celts are, and have ever been regarded as, a weak and bruti&s;h people; and in revenge tells us we are all Sarmatae, a people eminently martial and famous, which he forgets; but remarkable, as his expre&s;s quotations &s;hew, for na&s;tine&s;s! Fielding tells us, that a &s;hallow book may, like a &s;hallow man, be ea&s;ily &s;een thro; and i can &s;ee nothing, if the de&s;ign of Mr. Macpher&s;on's book be not to exalt

<P>Sorry i am, toward the end of the Eighteenth Century, to be &s;hewing, again&s;t a Briti&s;h author, that the Germans were not Sarmatae; that is, that a Saxon, or a Sile&s;ian, is not a Ru&s;&s;ian, and does not &s;peak the Sarmatic (Slavonic), but Go|thic tongue. For if a German &s;tudent, in his fir&s;t year at college, &s;hould happen to &s;ee this tract, he will conclude me as ignorant as my countryman, Mr. Macpher&s;on; to confute ab&s;o|lute non&s;en&s;e being &s;urely as ridiculous as to write it. Stung with this reflection, i &s;hall ha&s;ten from my aukward &s;ituation, after a &s;light remark or two; for it would be ab&s;urd to draw a &s;word when a &s;traw will do, and i have a champion of far other force to encounter.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ole</HI> authority which Mr. Macpher&s;on can find, for this new and profound idea, is a pa&s;&s;age which, with his u&s;ual peremptory brevity, he quotes thus: "<HI>Gothi, Vandalique ab antiquis Sar|matis originem ducunt.</HI> Procop. lib. I." (<HI>Intro|duct. p.</HI> 34. edit. 3d.) Not to mention the ig|norant oddity of quoting a Greek author in Latin, the reader mu&s;t be informed there is no &s;uch pa&s;|&s;age in Procopius, nor even one the lea&s;t like it. This would alone be reckoned a full confutation: but as this work is not a controver&s;ial one, but written with the mo&s;t &s;incere and &s;acred de&s;ign of di&s;covering the truth, i &s;hall produce the real pa&s;|&s;age in Procopius, to which Mr. Macpher&s;on, or the per&s;on he had the above quotation from<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>It is thought that &s;ome friend has furni&s;hed Mr. M. with his quotations; and it is hardly po&s;&s;ible otherwi&s;e to account for his evidently, on many occa&s;ions, not under&s;tanding his own quotations; but even adducing them &s;ometimes to con|tradict his own inferences.

Anciently they were called Sarmatae, and Melanchlaeni: &s;ome have al&s;o called them Getic nations."</HI> Le&s;t the reader may think that Mr. Macpher&s;on quoted from the Latin tran&s;lation, it is al&s;o added. <HI>Plurimae quidem &s;uperioribus fuere temporibus, hodieque &s;unt, nationes Gothicae; &s;ed inter illas Gothi, Vandali, Vi&s;igothi, et Gepaedes, cum numero tum dignitate prae&s;tant. Olim Sauromatae dicebantur, ac Melanchlaeni: qui|dam etiam Getarum nomen ip&s;is tribuerunt.</HI> This is certainly an authority; but an authority as light as a feather, compared to any one of the au|thorities again&s;t it. Procopius lived in the time of Ju&s;tinian, about the year 540: and was &s;ecretary to Beli&s;arius, in who&s;e African war he was pre&s;ent. His authority as to events of his own times, (and his whole hi&s;tory is that of his own times, as the title bears,) is very good; but as to origins and names of nations in the We&s;t of Europe he could know nothing, and had no opportunity, being a lawyer of Cae&s;area, in Pale&s;tine, the mo&s;t di&s;tant place that ever Greek author wrote in. His hor|rible ignorance with regard to the We&s;t of Eu|rope
<PB N="95" REF="557" MS="y">may be judged from his account of Britain, &s;o famous for its ab&s;urdity. The origins, and ancient names of nations, he could only have from the ancient Greek and Roman writers; and when he po&s;itively contradicts them, as he does here, he is certainly in error by quoting from memory, and can be confuted now as fully as in his own time, being &s;o very late an author. That the Goths or Getae were never called Sarmatae and Melanchlaeni, as Procopius fables, is clear from ALL writers who mention them, from Herodotus down to his own time: for even Jornandes is not &s;o ignorant as this, but mentions the Sarmatae always as a di&s;tinct people from the Getae or Goths. Strabo, who was mi&s;led by Ephorus with regard to &s;ome Scythae of A&s;ia being Sarmatae, never dreamed that the Getae were Sarmatae, but di&s;tingui&s;hes them repeatedly in expre&s;s terms. The Gepidae, and Vandals, were German nations; the former being a part of the Ba&s;ternae; the latter &s;o well known in the page of Pliny and Tacitus. Ovid may &s;hew that the Getae were not Sar|matae, for, as above quoted, he learned both Getic and Sarmatic. Now Mr. Macpher&s;on &s;ays in his margin, p. 37. <HI>"The Sarmatae ance&s;tors of the Germans;"</HI> and on this he proceeds thro his work, without once recollecting that Tacitus (a writer who&s;e truth and accuracy every day almo&s;t &s;hews more and more to have been perfect) makes the &s;tronge&s;t di&s;tinction between the Germans and Sarmatae thro his whole immortal <HI>Germania.</HI> He &s;ays the Germans wore tight dre&s;s, <HI>non fluitante &s;icut Sarmatae,</HI> 'not flowing as the Sarmatae wear:' and mentioning &s;ome remote nations, at the end, &s;ays, <HI>Germanis an Sarmatis ad&s;cribam dubito,</HI> 'I doubt whether to put them as Germans or Sar|matae.' Why did he think the Germans indigenes, but becau&s;e he found them totally different from the Sarmatae? Had any re&s;emblance exi&s;ted, nothing was &s;o natural as to &s;uppo&s;e them &s;prung
<PB N="96" REF="558" MS="y">from the Sarmatae, a great bordering people. That the Sarmatae were a di&s;tinct people from the Scythae proper, even Herodotus knew at fir&s;t, as appears by his mentioning a part of the Sarmatae learning the Scythian tongue; and by the whole tenor of his famous account of the expedition of Darius again&s;t the Scythae, in which he places the Sarmatae north of the Scythae. And Herodotus places Scythae in Germany, and Sarmatae to the Ea&s;t of them, as &s;hall pre&s;ently be &s;hewn. Diony|&s;ius di&s;tingui&s;hes the Germans and Sarmatae, v. 304. <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. Prolemy, the geographer, who wrote about forty years after Ta|citus, was the fir&s;t, who, from the ample information then received concerning the earth, as known to the ancients, put down <HI>Sarmatia Europaea,</HI> and <HI>Sarmatia A&s;iatica,</HI> in their full and ju&s;t extent of all the na|tions who &s;poke the Sarmatic tongue; that is all Ru&s;&s;ia in Europe, and a great part of Poland, for the former; and that part of Ru&s;&s;ia which lies be|tween the Tanais or Don and the north-ea&s;t of the Ca&s;pian for the latter, or A&s;iatic Sarmatia. After the times of Tacitus and Ptolemy, all writers, down to the benighted age in which Procopius wrote, mention the Sarmatae as a marked, di&s;tinct, peculiar, people. They had a va&s;t country to rove in, whence only a few from the &s;outh-we&s;t ever attacked the Romans: and tho coins of Con&s;tantine I. impudently bear SARMATIA DEVICTA, he hardly ever had a peep at a cor|ner of the country. Tho&s;e Sarmatae who invaded the Romans at any future time were indeed &s;o few that we find them very &s;lightly mentioned<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>So &s;lightly that they make no more figure than any <HI>one of twenty</HI> Gothic nations.

Indeed, Mr. M. had only to look into Cluverius, Cellarius, or any &s;chool-book of geography, to &s;ee that he was blundering almo&s;t beyond po&s;&s;ibility. But to conclude this point, i &s;hall &s;hew the reader how little the &s;ole te&s;timony of Procopius is to be relied on, by actually confuting this pa&s;&s;age of that author, by another from his own very work, and a part of it wholly geographical, and of cour&s;e more accurate. This pa&s;&s;age occurs in Book IV. chap. 5. <GAP DESC="foreign">. That is literally, <HI>'To him who

And at a great di&s;tance were placed the Goths, and Vi&s;igoths, and Vandals, and all the other Gothic nations, who were al&s;o called Scythians in ancient times, &s;ince all the nations in the&s;e parts were in common called Scythic.

Let the greate&s;t of modern geographers, M. D' Anville, put the &s;eal to this idle controver&s;y.

<P N="2">II. <HI>The Germans not Celts.</HI> Let us now proceed to the &s;econd opinion, namely, that the Germans were Celts. This has a far other champion than Mr. Macpher&s;on, to wit, Cluverius, a writer of &s;ome learning, and who would have regarded a mi&s;quotation as the ruin of his character. In que&s;|tions of this kind, learning and accuracy are all in all. Genius will only mi&s;lead by fal&s;e &s;plendors;
<PB N="100" REF="562">but profound learning, cold penetration, and ma|ture judgment will throw the &s;teady light of truth over a &s;ubject like this. Unhappily Cluverius had but moderate learning, no penetration, and a judgment cool but not vigorous. He al&s;o wrote two centuries too &s;oon: his <HI>Germania Antiqua</HI> being publi&s;hed in 1616, when the Gothic and Celtic Languages were unknown, no monu|ments of them being in print; &s;o that he wanted all information, and is but a blind guide at be&s;t. Yet has this blind guide been followed by almo&s;t all authors down to this day; witne&s;s Key&s;ler, in his <HI>Antiquitates Septentrionales et Celticae,</HI> Hano|verae 1720, 8vo; Pelloutier in his <HI>Hi&s;toire des Celtes, et particulierement des Gaulois, et des Germains,</HI> Haye, 1750, 2 tomes 12mo. and Mallet in his <HI>Introduction &agrave; l'Hi&s;t. de Dannemarc,</HI> 1755, 4to. and many others, who, as u&s;ual with the run of writers, found it ea&s;ier to copy than to inve&s;tigate. But as Cluverius is their guide, he may be con&s;idered as the &s;ole champion; for the learning of Key&s;ler and Mallet was &s;o minute as to amount to nothing: Pelloutier is learned, but is a great plagiary from Cluverius; and they all have not even argued the point, but taken it for granted. Far other was the practice of the mo&s;t learned and ingenious tran&s;lator of Mallet into Engli&s;h, who has altered his author &s;o far as infected with this gro&s;s error, and has in an able preface &s;hewn that it is impo&s;|&s;ible that the Germans could be Celts. But, tho he has demon&s;trated this &s;o fully that i might only refer to his work, yet he has not attended to the identity of the Scythians and Goths, nor laid open the real origin of the Germans. As i am glad of &s;uch able a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this toil&s;ome ta&s;k, i &s;hall give an ab&s;tract of his arguments, and add &s;ome of my own.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves that all the arguments of Cluverius and Pelloutier, (if they may be called arguments), fall under two heads, <HI>Quotations</HI> from the ancient Greek and Roman authors, and <HI>Etymologies</HI> of
<PB N="101" REF="563">the names of per&s;ons and places. The later he con&s;iders fir&s;t; and well ob&s;erves that <Q>arguments derived from etymology are &s;o very uncertain and precarious, that they can only amount to pre|&s;umptions at be&s;t, and can never be oppo&s;ed to &s;o|lid po&s;itive proofs.</Q> At the end he gives &s;pecimens of Celtic etymology, from that in&s;ane work, the <HI>Me|moires de la langue Celtique par M. Bullet. Be&s;an&ccedil;on,</HI> 1754, 3 vols, folio, from which it appears that a man mu&s;t be a lunatic who founds any thing upon a language &s;o loo&s;e as to take any impre&s;&s;ion. Such are <HI>Northampton</HI> (North Hampton) from <HI>Nor,</HI> the mouth of a river, <HI>Tan</HI> a river, <HI>Ton</HI> habitation. <HI>Northill</HI> (North Hill) from <HI>Nor</HI> river, and <HI>Tyne</HI> habitation. <HI>Ringwood</HI> from <HI>Ren</HI> a divi&s;ion, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w</HI> a river, and <HI>bed</HI> a fore&s;t. <HI>Uxbridge</HI> (Ou&s;e-bridge) from <HI>uc</HI> river, and <HI>brig</HI> divi&s;ion. <HI>Ri&s;um teneatis?</HI> Let me add, that the Iri&s;h, and Wel&s;h, and Armo|rican tongues, the only dialects of Celtic we have, (for the Highland Gaelic is but corrupted Iri&s;h) are at this day, and from the earlie&s;t MSS. remain|ing, one half Gothic: and a great part Latin, owing to the Romans living four centuries among the Welch, and the u&s;e of Latin in Ireland on the introduction of Chri&s;tianity. The Gothic words are &s;o numerous, that Ihre calls the Celtic, &s;o re|puted, a dialect of the Gothic; fal&s;ely, becau&s;e the grammar and &s;tructure, the &s;oul of the language, are totally different: but the&s;e Gothic words proceeded from the Belgae, Saxons, and Danes, being intermingled with the Wel&s;h, and Iri&s;h. For that the&s;e words did not pa&s;s from Celtic into Gothic is clear, becau&s;e all the roots, branches, and relations of the words are found in the Gothic, but in Celtic only &s;ingle detached words; as we u&s;e the French <HI>eclairci&s;&s;ement,</HI> but not <HI>eclairer,</HI> &amp;c. The few words peculiarly Celtic, and of which a Glo&s;&s;ary, by a per&s;on of complete &s;kill in the Gothic, would be highly valuable, have &s;o many &s;ignifications, that to found etymology on them is wor&s;e than madne&s;s.
<PB N="102" REF="564" MS="y">In the Iri&s;h one word has often ten, twenty, or thirty meanings; <HI>gal</HI> implies <HI>a &s;tranger, a native, milk, a warrior, white, a pledge, a conqueror, the belly of a trout, a wager,</HI> &amp;c. This mu&s;t be the ca&s;e in all &s;avage tongues, which mu&s;t be poor and confu&s;ed. But the Celtic, i will venture to &s;ay, is of all &s;avage languages the mo&s;t confu&s;ed, as the Celts are of all &s;avages the mo&s;t deficient in under&s;tanding. Wi&s;dom and ingenuity may be traced among the Samoieds, Laplanders, Ne|groes, &amp;c. but among the Celts, none of native growth. All etymology of names is folly; but Celtic etymology is &s;heer frenzy. Enough of Celtic etymology! let us leave it to candidates for bedlam, and go on.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Quotations,</HI> i mu&s;t beg leave to differ from the learned Tran&s;lator of Mallet, who puts a &s;light value on them. Far from this, had the ancients been again&s;t me, i would at once have acceded to their &s;entiments: for AUTHORITIES ARE FACTS IN HISTORY, and to argue again&s;t them is to lo&s;e labour, as we mu&s;t return to them at la&s;t. But the learned Schoepflin has &s;o fully &s;hewn, in his <HI>Vindiciae Celticae,</HI> that the ancients are po&s;itive again&s;t the Germans being Celts, that he has left nothing to add. He &s;hews that Dio Ca&s;&s;ius, a writer of the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious character, as well known, and who&s;e accounts are often contradictory of Cae&s;ar, Tacitus, Suetonius, and others the be&s;t informed, is the ONLY author who calls the Germans, Celts. And that again&s;t Dio are Herodotus, Ari&s;totle, Polybius, Diodorus Siculus, Diony&s;ius Halicar|na&s;&s;aeus, Strabo, Diony&s;ius Periegetes, Plutarch, Pau&s;anias, Ptolemy, Athenaeus, Stephanus Byzan|tinus; and ALL the Latin authors. Dio was in|deed another Ephorus; for &s;uch writers will ari&s;e, and the ancients had ignorant and fooli&s;h authors as well as we. Cae&s;ar and Tacitus &s;o fully confute Dio in this, as in many other matters, that he is ju&s;tly regarded as an ignorant fabuli&s;t; and Lip&s;ius has well ob&s;erved, that he mu&s;t be redd with extreme
<PB N="103" REF="565" MS="y">caution. Indeed Cae&s;ar and Tacitus are &s;o direct again&s;t the ideas of Cluverius and Pelloutier, that they are eternally oppo&s;ing their authority; whereas they are the very chief authors we can depend on: Cae&s;ar having warred in Gaul and Germany; and Tacitus living, as <HI>Procurator Belgiae</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vita Taciti, operib. praef. ex Plinii Hi&s;t. Nat. ni fallor.</NOTE>, upon the confines of Gaul and Germany.</P>
<P>The learned tran&s;lator of Mallet next proceeds to po&s;itive proofs, that the Germans were not Celts, but differed from them widely in per&s;on, manners, laws, religion, and language.</P>
<P><HI>In Per&s;on.</HI> From Tacitus <HI>in Agricola,</HI> cap. 11. who &s;ays the inhabitants of Caledonia re&s;embled the Germans in per&s;on, while the Britons next Gaul re&s;embled the Gauls; that is, let me add, the &s;outh-we&s;t Britons, who were Celts not Bel|gae, re&s;embled the oppo&s;ite Celtic Gauls.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER II.</HI> The Germans were Scythoe. FIRST GRAND ARGUMENT: From Identity of Language.</HEAD>
<P>THE opinions that the ancient Germans were Sarmatae, and that they were Celts, being &s;hewn to be erroneous, i proceed to e&s;tabli&s;h that they were Scythae, who continued their progre&s;s from ancient Scythia, and their extended territo|ries of Getia and Dacia into Germany, the bor|dering country.

For tho the Vi&s;tula was gene|rally put as the ea&s;tern boundary of Germany, this was owing to the Venedi, and one or two other Sarmatic nations, being found between the Chronus and Vi&s;tula: but the whole <HI>Germani Tran&s;vi&s;tulani,</HI> or va&s;t divi&s;ion of Germans called BASTERNAE, amounting, as Pliny &s;tates, to a fifth part of the Germans, were beyond the Vi&s;tula, in pre&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia, Polachia, Ma&s;ovia, and Red Ru&s;&s;ia. So that the Chronus or Niemen was cer|tainly the proper boundary between the Germans and Sarmatae, tho the &s;uperior cour&s;e and fame of the Vi&s;tula mad&eacute; it the popular barrier. That the Scandinavians were Ba&s;ternae, or Tran&s;vi&s;tular Germans, right rea&s;on might in&s;truct us, had we not the po&s;itive authority of Strabo, with colla|teral proofs from Tacitus, Ptolemy, and others, as after explained.

<P>The con&s;onance of the&s;e Scythic remains with the old German is univer&s;ally known.

<PB N="111" REF="575" MS="y">re&s;emblance of the German or Scandinavian dialect of the Gothic, gives it in favour of the former, adding that &s;ome words, as might be ex|pected, are neither found in the old German nor Scandinavian<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">In Di&s;&s;ert. de Evangel.

<P>The Scandinavian, of which the olde&s;t reliques are I&s;landic, and begin with Arius Frodi, in the Eleventh century, is a dialect of the German.

Hence the Icelandic, being a more poli&s;hed language than the German, has le&s;s a&s;&s;inity with the parent Gothic. The Swedi&s;h is nearer related to the Icelandic than either the Dani&s;h or Norwegian; the two later countries being under one monarch of German extract, and from the proximity of Denmark to Germany, many words have crept in. But that the Swedi&s;h is the daughter of the Scythic of Ulphilas is amply known from Ihre's work, the <HI>Glo&s;&s;arium Suio-Gothicum.</HI> Nor is there occa&s;ion to in&s;i&s;t upon

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER III.</HI> The Germans were Scythae. SECOND GRAND ARGUMENT: From the te&s;timonies of Ancient Authors.</HEAD>
<P>IN examining the origin of nations language is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed an infallible criterion. But in all other ancient facts the authorities of ancient writers form the ONLY evidence we can po&s;&s;ibly have. Without them we can know nothing of the &s;ubject. Human affairs by no means proceed ac|cording to rea&s;on, &s;peculation, or philo&s;ophy; but depend on various contingencies, which can only be learned from ancient authors. It cannot therefore be too often repeated that AUTHORITIES ARE FACTS IN HISTORY. Lord Bacon introduced experimental philo&s;ophy again&s;t theories of nature; and in hi&s;tory theory is even more fooli&s;h than in na|tural philo&s;ophy, &s;eeing that nature has great laws, which hi&s;tory has not. What we now call the phi|lo&s;ophy of hi&s;tory was introduced by Voltaire, and a few other ignorant theori&s;ts, unacquainted with that great reading, upon which the experimental philo&s;ophy of hi&s;tory mu&s;t &s;tand. For if we rea&s;on upon fal&s;ehoods, our rea&s;oning mu&s;t be fal&s;e: and in ancient hi&s;tory facts can only be found by the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous peru&s;al of all the writers who &s;tate the&s;e facts, or throw light on them. If we tru&s;t conjecture, or philo&s;ophical non&s;en&s;e, there is no end; for a thou&s;and authors may give us a thou|&s;and theories, and we mu&s;t return to the ancients at la&s;t. The migrations of nations are al&s;o facts &s;o very ample, and &s;triking, and leave &s;uch traces,
<PB N="116" REF="580">that even the mo&s;t ignorant know them; as there is not a pea&s;ant in Europe who is to learn that the North American colonies went from Britain. When therefore ancient authors univer&s;ally agree in &s;uch large facts, their te&s;timony is infallible, and pre&s;ents every evidence of hi&s;toric truth.</P>
<P><HI>SECOND GRAND ARGUMENT. The Ger|mans were Scythae, from ancient authorities.</HI></P>
<P>The knowlege which the Greek and Roman authors, preceding Cae&s;ar, had of Germany, was ob&s;cure, and confined. About 450 years before our aera, Herodotus, the earlie&s;t writer who can afford us any intelligence on this &s;ubject, thought that the Danube ro&s;e near a town of the Celts called Py<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rhene, not far from the pillars of Her|cules<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lib. II.</NOTE>: that is, the Pyrenees in Spain. He al&s;o tells that the Eridanus, or Po, ran into the Northern ocean, in pre&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia, where the amber always was, and is now alone found, an idea which ap|parently aro&s;e from this, that the amber was brought from Pru&s;&s;ia overland to the mouth of the Po, there to be &s;hipped for Greece. About 250 years before Chri&s;t, Apollonius Rhodius affords equal marks of ignorance in geography. For he makes the Argonauts, in their return, pa&s;s from the Euxine up the Danube into the Cronian, or Baltic &s;ea; thence into the Eridanus, or Po, which, with Herodotus, he &s;uppo&s;ed fell into the Baltic; a branch of which leads them into the Rhone; an arm of which later would have carried them we&s;t to the great ocean, had not Juno cried to them from the Hercynian rock, or Hercynian fore&s;t in Germany<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Argonaut. IV. 290.640.</NOTE>. This was the cour&s;e of their voyage: and &s;uch was the ignorance of an exqui&s;ite and learned poet, who had &s;tudied and lived long at Alexandria, in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and had certainly the u&s;e of the large&s;t library of ancient times! Polybius, who wrote about 160
<PB N="117" REF="581">years befor&egrave; Chri&s;t, &s;ays in his third book, 'All that country between the Tanais and Narbonne, to the north, is unknown to us, till by curious in|ve&s;tigation we learn &s;omewhat concerning it. They therefore, who write or &s;peak otherwi&s;e, are either ignorant, or fabuli&s;ts.' This re&s;triction includes all Germany, Scandinavia, Britain, and the mo&s;t of Gaul.</P>
<P>But this ignorance of the ancients related chiefly to the geography of the&s;e regions; for as to the great divi&s;ions of men who inhabited them, namely the Scythae and Celts, they were by no means ig|norant. We knew that the Japane&s;e were a Chine&s;e colony, and that the Icelanders had pa&s;t from Norway, for centuries before we had any thing but fables, as to the geography of the&s;e countries: and &s;uch was the ca&s;e with the ancients. One navigation may di&s;cover the name, language, and manners, of a di&s;tant people: while to give an accurate geography of their country, whole cen|turies are required; e&s;pecially in ancient ages, when voyages were only made by ignorant mariners and traders, for the mere &s;ake of gain. The Phoenicians were &s;ettled at Gades in Spain, and at Utica in Afric, about 1200 years before Chri&s;t, or three hundred years before the building of Car|thage, which la&s;t was the foundation of a party who had fled to a well known &s;hore, and not an original trading colony. Gaul and Britain were certainly vi&s;ited by the Phoenicians, long before Germany and Scandinavia were at all known to the Greeks or Romans. But the Phoenicians, as Strabo tells us, carefully concealed all knowlege of the&s;e countries, le&s;t other nations might interfere in their trade. The &s;tory of the Phoenician &s;hip is well known, the ma&s;ter of which, ob&s;erving a Roman ve&s;&s;el following his tract in the&s;e &s;eas, ran aground on purpo&s;e, and thus wrecked his own &s;hip and the Roman that followed him. This act was deemed &s;o patriotic, that he was richly re|warded

<PB N="118" REF="584" MS="y">warded by the &s;enate of Carthage. The part of Germany at the mouth of the Vi&s;tula, or pre&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia, was certainly known to the Greeks before the time of Herodotus; and it was the country that &s;upplied all the amber in ancient times, as it does in the pre&s;ent. That Greek merchants travelled there, and had e&s;tabli&s;hed the mart for it, at the mouth of the Po, there is every rea&s;on to be|lieve. And if the natives brought it down to that mart, the merchants would equally learn their name, &s;ituation, language, and manners. Herodotus men|tions the Marus, or Moraw, of pre&s;ent Moravia, a river to the we&s;t of the Vi&s;tula; and &s;ays it ri&s;es in the country of the Agathyr&s;i, whom Diony&s;ius and other geographers place on the north of Marus, up to the Balric. The Eridanus of Herodotus may well be interpreted the Vi&s;tula; for there is no rea&s;on why the Greeks &s;hould not have given the &s;ame name to the two differentrivers, e&s;pecially while their authors afford many examples of this kind. The de&s;cription of Herodotus can alone apply to the Vi&s;tula, at who&s;e mouth only amber was and is found, and where the region of the Hy|perboreans was, as he and other ancients &s;tate. And this commerce of amber &s;eems to have opened the connection between the Hyperboreans and the Greeks, &s;o famous in antiquity. M. D' Anville has erred in placing the Hyperboreans in the north of European Ru&s;&s;ia, a region unknown to the an|cients.

<PB N="121" REF="587" MS="y">luminous comprehen&s;ion of his great &s;oul, was to be the fountain of this irradiation. From his ad|mirable Commentaries on the Gallic War it is evident that the Celts, far from being, as Pellou|tier idiotically &s;uppo&s;es, &s;pred over all Europe, were in fact confined to one third of Gaul, as every &s;chool-boy knows who has redd the fir&s;t line of his work<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Gallia e&s;t omnis divi&s;a in partes tres.

The Aquitani held the &s;outh-we&s;t part of Gaul; and were al&s;o of different language, manners, and laws, from the other two; being Iberi who had pa&s;&s;ed from Spain, to which they had come from Africa<NOTE N="cc" PLACE="foot"><P>The Iberian language &s;urvives in the Cantabric and Ba&s;que.

Strabo IV. p. 266. &s;ays of the Aquitani, 'they re&s;emble the Iberi more than the Galli (or Celts) of whom they have neither the form nor idiom.'

For the Belgae, as Cae&s;ar &s;hews, had all the &s;outh-ea&s;t of pre&s;ent England; and the Piks, a Germano-Scandinavian people, as Tacitus and Beda prove, had all the

In Ireland, it is clear from Ptolemy, that the Belgae held all the &s;outh-ea&s;t parts, and that they had not proceeded from Britain, but from Belgic Gaul and Germany; for of the <HI>Menapii</HI> and <HI>Chauci,</HI> or <HI>Cauci,</HI> we find no trace in Britain<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">There was a &s;mall <HI>town</HI> called Menapia in Wales, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the <HI>people</HI> Menapii in Ireland, and apparently founded by them.

<P>Even in the regions retained by the Celts, which were minute, they were mingled with German Goths; and their &s;peech with German or Gothic words. The old Iri&s;h grammarians, as Mr. O'Conor<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In his publication of O'Flaherty's Vindication of Ogygia, Dublin, 1775, 8<HI>vo.</HI> praef. p. xxvii.</NOTE> tells, call their Gallic, or Iri&s;h tongue, <HI>Berla Tebide,</HI> or a mixt language. The Wel&s;h, as all know, is, even in it's mo&s;t ancient remains, full of Dani&s;h and Engli&s;h words. The Gallic, Celtic, or Iri&s;h, of the Highlands of Scotland, is of all the Celtic dialects the mo&s;t corrupt, and mixt with Gothic; owing to the neighbourhood of the Piks; and to the Norwegians holding the Hebudes and we&s;tern coa&s;t of Scotland, from the time of Harald Harfagre, or about 880, till 1266, when regained by the Scots; but the Norwegians remained as principal tenants, and the chief families in the&s;e parts are all Norwegian. So that in fact
<PB N="123" REF="589">the Celtic, far from being a pure &s;peech, is the mo&s;t mixt and corrupt in the world. For the Celts were &s;o inferior a people, being to the Scy|thae as a negro to an European, that, as all hi&s;tory &s;hews, to &s;ee them, was to conquer them; and as they had no arts, nor inventions, of their own, they of cour&s;e received innumerable words from other tongues. But the nomenclature of a lan|guage is only it's dre&s;s, while it's grammar forms the &s;oul and body; and the Celtic grammar is totally remote from that of all Gothic languages. So much &s;o that, by a mode, perhaps unknown to any other &s;peech, they decline nouns beginning with labials, by altering the initials, as the Goths, Greeks, and Romans, altered the termination. Thus <HI>Mac</HI> is <HI>a &s;on; Mhic,</HI> (pronounce <HI>Wic</HI>) <HI>of a &s;on,</HI> &amp;c. Nay the pronouns alter the beginning of nouns, thus <HI>Pen, a head; i Ben, his head; i Phen, her head; y'm Mhen, my head.</HI> A &s;trange and horrible ab&s;urdity! as it cancels every rule of language; and mu&s;t &s;hew a confu&s;ed and dark under&s;tanding in the people who u&s;e it, nay even to &s;peak it mu&s;t <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> throw a mi&s;t over the mind. Yet is it much to be wi&s;hed that profe&s;&s;or|&s;hips of the Celtic tongue were e&s;tabli&s;hed in our univer&s;ities, that &s;uch remains as are of that &s;peech might be explained and placed in a ju&s;t light. We naturally reverence what we do not know<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ignotis reverentia major. <HI>Tacit.</HI></NOTE>; and this may be called the Celtic century, for all Eu|rope has been inundated with non&s;en&s;e about the Celts. When we come to the truth about them, and Time always draws truth out of the well, the Celtic mi&s;t will vani&s;h, or become a mere cloud.</P>
<P>To return. Cae&s;ar, by &s;hewing the Celts to be confined to &s;uch &s;mall bounds, palpably marks that other nations had gained ground on them, &s;o as to confine them to &s;uch a contracted &s;pace. And in his fine de&s;cription of the Germans in book VI. and in other pa&s;&s;ages, he &s;hews them to
<PB N="124" REF="590">have totally differed from the Celts. What peo|ple then were they? That they were not Sarmatae, all know: and the only other people, whom the ancients know in the north-we&s;t of Europe, were the Scythae, as ju&s;t &s;hewn. It follows then that they were Scythae. The Greek authors had cer|tainly acquired &s;ome knowlege of Germany two centuries at lea&s;t before Cae&s;ar, for he &s;ays, book VI. <HI>Germaniae loca circum Hercyniam &s;ilvam, quam Erato&s;theni, et quibu&s;dam Graecis, fama notam e&s;&s;e video, quam illi Orciniam appellant, Volcae Tec|to&s;ages occuparunt.</HI> And we &s;hall &s;ee in&s;tantly that Diodorus Siculus, one of the be&s;t informed, and mo&s;t judicious of the Greek hi&s;torians, and who wrote after Cae&s;ar's di&s;coveries, repeatedly calls all Germany, even to the furthe&s;t we&s;t and north, <HI>Scythia.</HI> It may be a&s;ked, why does not Cae&s;ar call the country Scythia? Why this new appella|tion of Germany? Be it an&s;wered, that another country was peculiarly called Scythia, namely, Little or Ancient Scythia on the Euxine. And that tho the Greeks called all that tract, to which the Scythians extended, Scythia, yet tho&s;e Scy|thian nations bore different names, as Thraces, Illyrians, &amp;c. Of cour&s;e Cae&s;ar, finding the Ger|mans &s;o called by their countrymen of Belgic Gaul, gives them, mo&s;t properly, their &s;pecific, and not generic name. Nor does Cae&s;ar write as a geographer, but as a warrior: he &s;ays not a word of their origin, &amp;c. but only de&s;cribes their manners. Tacitus, <HI>in Germ.</HI> &s;pecially informs, that the name of Germans was a late one.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">It is worth remark, that there was a Per&s;ian people called <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Germans.</HI> Herod.

But THOSE who inhabit BEYOND the Celtic region, and the parts toward the SOUTH, and &s;ituated on the ocean; and THOSE toward the Hercynian mountains, and all onward, even to Scythia (<GAP DESC="foreign">) are called Gauls." We&s;&s;eling ob&s;erves, that this is fal&s;e, becau&s;e the Romans called the Celts al&s;o Gauls. But Diodorus no doubt knowing that the Celts were not tho&s;e Gauls celebrated in Ro|man hi&s;tory, but quite a di&s;tinct people, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing the inner or further part of Gaul, he, with propriety, puts them as different nations. By the Celts Diodorus under&s;tands tho&s;e of Cae&s;ar, ex|tending from the north-we&s;t extremity of the Alps above Mar&s;eilles, into the inner parts of Gaul. Tho&s;e beyond the Celts, to the &s;outh on the ocean, are the Aquitani. Tho&s;e toward the Hercynian mountains, and onward to Scythia, are the Belgae. His Scythia is palpably Germany: as it is in the following pa&s;&s;ages.

Thus he &s;ays, "above the Getae, are the Tyragetae, and above the&s;e the Jazyges Sar|matae;" and he tells us, <HI>lib.</HI> VII. that Homer, by his Hippomolgi and Galactophagi, <HI>Il.</HI> XIII. means the Scythae and Sarmatae. So that by the Scythians he means not the Sarmatae.

And Strabo knew that the Scythae of Germany were the Getae, for book VII. p. 294. he &s;ays 'The Suevi hold the &s;outh &s;ide of Germany which is beyond the Elbe. After them lyes the region of the Getae, narrow on the &s;outh toward the I&s;ter, and toward the Hercynian fore&s;t, part of who&s;e mountains it comprehends, but extended largely to the north, even to the Tyragetae.' By the Getae Strabo pal|pably means all the Germans ea&s;t of the Elbe, namely the <HI>Vandali,</HI> and <HI>Hermiones,</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;ternae,</HI> of Pliny, being three of his five grand divi&s;ions of the Germans: the Ba&s;ternae actually &s;tretching ea&s;t to the river Tyras, on which the Tyragetae dwelled. Strabo al&s;o, as &s;hall be after &s;hewn, places Ba&s;ternae in Scandinavia. Hence it is clear that Strabo looked on the&s;e three grand divi&s;ions of the Germans as Getae, Scythians, or Goths; and of cour&s;e would have regarded the others as &s;uch, had he learned, as we do from Tacitus, that the whole Germans to the furthe&s;t extremity were all of one origin, language, and manners.</P>
<P N="8">8. Mela wrote about the year 45. He di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the Scythians and Sarmatae, and gives a
<PB N="127" REF="593" MS="y">&s;eparate chapter on each. In b.

So that in his opinion the Scythians held Scandi|navia, oppo&s;ite to which Thule is placed by all the ancients.</P>
<P N="9">9. Pliny, the natural hi&s;torian, wrote in Ve&s;pa|&s;ian's time, about 70 years after Chri&s;t. In his fourth book, ch. 12, he tells us, that the Scythian nations, including the Sarmatae, &s;tretched all along the north, and north-we&s;t of the Danube; and then adds the following memorable and deci&s;ive &s;entence. Before reading it, let us recollect that Pliny prefixes to his immortal work the contents of each book; and a li&s;t of the authors u&s;ed in that book, from which it appears that his reading was, as his nephew informs us, infinite. No wri|ter in all antiquity ever had &s;uch exuberance of information; and the que&s;tion could not be &s;ub|mitted to a more able arbiter. Hear his verdict. SCYTHARUM NOMEN USQUEQUAQUE TRANSIT IN SARMATAS, ATQUE GERMANOS. NEC ALIIS PRISCA ILLA DURAVIT APPELLATIO, QUAM QUI, EXTREMI GENTIUM HARUM, IGNOTI PROPE CETERIS MOR|TALIBUS DEGUNT. <HI>The name of Scythians is every where changed to that of Sarmatae, and Germans. Nor has that ancient appellation continued, &s;ave to the mo&s;t di&s;tant of the&s;e two nations, who live almo&s;t unknown to other mortals.</HI> The Sarmatae, as above explained, were, by &s;ome le&s;s informed ancients, regarded as a nation of the Scythae; for before Ptolemy's time, who wrote near a century after Pliny, little intelligence had been got about the Sarmatae, a people who occupied a country as large as all the Scythian po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions put together. Their language was totally different, as the Slavonic is from the Gothic or Scythic of Ulphilas. But
<PB N="128" REF="594">&s;ome Greek writers knowing that the Scythae ex|tended all over the north-we&s;t of Europe, had con|&s;idered the Sarmatae al&s;o as a Scythic nation. The name of Scythians, given to the Sarmatae, was but a vulgar inaccuracy, as we term the Americans We&s;t-Indians. Di&s;tant objects become indi&s;tinct, and their appellations of cour&s;e inaccurate. Yet, tho wrong in denominating the Sarmatae Scy|thians, the ancients knew they were perfectly right in giving that name to the Germans, after they had di&s;covered that the Sarmatae were quite a different race from the Scythians; &s;eeing that the German language and manners proved them the &s;ame people with the ancient Scythians on the Euxine. This is clear even from Strabo, who calls the Germans Getae, as ju&s;t &s;hewn; and from all the Greek writers after Ptolemy, who name the Germans Scythae. For the whole Ger|man nations were called Scythians or Goths in the fourth century; as the va&s;t German divi&s;ion of the <HI>Vindili</HI> (or <HI>Vandali,</HI> as &s;ome MSS.) of Pliny, the <HI>Sucvi, Angli, Langobardi,</HI> of Tacitus, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. are uniformly called Scythians or Goths after that time. For that the Greeks denominated all the&s;e nations Scythians, whom the Latins called Goths, has been amply demon&s;trated in the be|ginning of this e&s;&s;ay. The reader is reque&s;ted to attend to this important circum&s;tance, for if he falls into the vulgar delu&s;ion of the Goths being a paltry tribe of Germany, or of Scandinavia, he will err prodigiou&s;ly. The Latin name <HI>Goths,</HI> and Greek term <HI>Scythians,</HI> belong to the whole barbaric nations from the Ca&s;pian to the Adriatic, ea&s;t and &s;outh, to the Briti&s;h channel we&s;t, and Scandinavia, and river Chronus or Niemen, north and north ea&s;t. The Sarmatae are by all writers after Ptolemy placed on the north-ea&s;t of the Scy|thae, in pre&s;ent Poland and Ru&s;&s;ia; and marked as a &s;eparate and peculiar, great people. It was
<PB N="119" REF="595">from the va&s;t plains of Getia, Gothia, or Ancient Scythia, and of Germany, that the ruder Goths &s;pred over Europe, on the fall of the Roman empire; and not from the bleak and de&s;ert mountains of Scandinavia, or from one little di&s;trict in Germany, as childi&s;hly dreamed.</P>
<P>To produce all the other ancient authorities, that the Germans were Scythae, would &s;well this tract to a folio volume; and what are given will, it is believed, fully &s;uffice. Tacitus thinks the Germans indigenes, for a rea&s;on which has de|&s;ervedly excited laughter, namely, that all the ancient migrations were by &s;ea, not by land! As if the inhabitants of &s;uch a region as Germany could be tran&s;ported by &s;ea, like the little colo|nies of antiquity! He adds, that no nation would proceed from better climates to people &s;uch a country; forgetting, as M. Brotier ju&s;tly remarks, that nece&s;&s;ity and &s;ecurity are the parents of bar|baric population. The Norwegians have peopled Iceland, and planted Greenland. But the mi|racles of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, the tale of the phoenix, and &s;uch remarks as the&s;e, only &s;hew that man is compo&s;ed of incon&s;i&s;tency, and that the &s;tronge&s;t on &s;ome occa&s;ions, are the weake&s;t on others: as the only &s;ublime hi&s;torian who ever wrote could &s;ometimes &s;ink mo&s;t profoundly from his eleva|tion. It can even be &s;hewn from Tacitus, that the Germans were Scythae, for we have remains of the language of &s;everal nations he mentions in Germany, and the&s;e remains are Scythic or Go|thic, as is the whole German language at this day. He him&s;elf, tho he di&s;tingui&s;hes the Ger|man &s;peech and manners from tho&s;e of the Celts and Sarmatae, in the mo&s;t direct terms, yet no where di&s;tingui&s;hes them from tho&s;e of the Daci, as he, with the Romans, calls the&s;e Getae who bordered on Germany. It may be &s;aid, the Getae might be a German emigration, as well
<PB N="130" REF="596">as the contrary; but again&s;t this are ALL the ancients, as every page of this work witne&s;&s;es, for they all &s;tate the Scythians to have proceeded from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t; and the whole tenor of that progre&s;s is marked and di&s;tinct, from Per&s;ia to Britain.</P>

<HEAD>THIRD GRAND ARGUMENT. The Germans were Scythae from &s;imilar Manners.</HEAD>
<P>Herodotus, in his fourth book, ch. 59 to 82, gives us a long account of the manners of the Scy|thae; and a peculiar happine&s;s &s;eems to have at|tended this favoured nation, for Tacitus has de|&s;cribed tho&s;e of their de&s;cendants the Germans; &s;o that the cleare&s;t &s;plendor is thrown on the &s;ub|ject. To run a parallel would &s;well this e&s;&s;ay to a va&s;t &s;ize, and they are &s;o like that they need only be referred to. Wormius, Bartholin, and other northern antiquaries, have remarked, that the de|&s;cription given of the Scythae by Herodotus, ap|plies perfectly to the Goths of their country, even down to a late age. The chief difference ari&s;es merely from a local circum&s;tance. It is that the ancient Scythae on the Euxine, de&s;cribed by He|rodotus, had found their fine breed of Per&s;ian hor&s;es thrive equally well in their fertile po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, on the temperate &s;hores of the Euxine; while, in Germany and Scandinavia, the cold was then too &s;evere for that &s;outhern race, and the indigenal breed was, as tacitus &s;tates, very &s;mall. Hence the Ancient Scythae were chiefly cavalry; while the Germans and Scandinavians had little or no cavalry. This difference was a nece&s;&s;ary effect of climate; and infers no di&s;tinction in the people, any more than the different life led by the Briti&s;h in the Ea&s;t Indies, from what they u&s;e here, de|&s;troys the identity of the people. In Iceland the Norwegians differed prodigiou&s;ly in manners from tho&s;e in Normandy, Calabria, or Sicily. But to in&s;tance a few particulars of &s;imilar Manners in the Scythae and Germans.</P>

They &s;wear by his name, and believe them&s;elves his progeny." The Greek and Roman writers applied the names of their own deities to tho&s;e of barbaric nations, as the &s;malle&s;t attribute of the idol led them. If a rude image held a &s;cepter, it was Jupiter: if a pur&s;e, Mercury; if a &s;word, Mars. Hence great confu&s;ion; for what denoted one attribute with the Greeks and Ro|mans might, with the barbaric nations, mark quite another, as nothing admits of various inter|pretation more than &s;ymbol. Tacitus &s;ays of the Germans, <HI>credunt Tui&s;tonem deum terra editum et filium Mannum, originem gentis, conditore&s;que.</HI> He|rodotus gives the god a Greek name, becau&s;e, in &s;ome &s;ymbol, he re&s;embled Mercury.

This fable &s;hews the univer&s;al tradi|tion of their origin; but Odin was merely the name of a deity, or rather an epithet, and they who &s;peak gravely of him as an hero are de|ceived. It was Odin, Mars, literally war, that opened their progre&s;s into the wilds of Scandina|via. The Gothic mythology has been weakly handled, but might, by a complete parallel, be &s;hewn to be the ancient Grecian. The Greek gods were the progeny of Caelus and Terra. Mannus, or Man, was de&s;cended of the gods, for in the hymns a&s;cribed to Orpheus, the Greeks are called their progeny: and &s;o the Greek poet
<PB N="135" REF="601">quoted by Saint Paul, &s;ays men are the offspring of Jove. The ancient Germans had al&s;o a Mars, and a Hercules, as Tacitus &s;ays. The former, it is likely, was Odin, and Warnefrid may be mi&s;|taken: the later was Thor, famous in the Edda and Volu&s;pa for his &s;trength. But he was the Ju|piter, or chief god, of northern mythology. In fact, even the Greek mythology is a ma&s;s of con|fu&s;ion, as all traditional matters mu&s;t be, and the &s;everal mythologi&s;ts differ radically in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points: no wonder then that the Gothic is embarra&s;&s;ed.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Government.</HI> Herodotus was unhappily no politician, and is quite mute concerning the go|vernment of the Scythae. Nor do i find in all antiquity, any de&s;cription of the Scythic con&s;titu|tions,
<PB N="136" REF="602">&s;o that the full light we receive from Tacitus concerning tho&s;e of the Germans cannot be for|mally paralleled with tho&s;e of their Scythic ance&s;|tors. The Greeks have been &s;hewn to be Scythae: let us therefore derive a few rays from them. Fa|mily government is always ari&s;tocratic, of father and mother, as Locke &s;hews. But as a family differs widely from a community, and as the later is compo&s;ed of many of the former, the ari&s;tocracy of family became in&s;tantly democracy, by the fa|thers of families directing public affairs by joint coun|&s;els. Thus it is demon&s;trable that democracy is the mo&s;t ancient form of government, for the very idea of a king is unknown to early &s;ociety. In war one leader was of nece&s;&s;ity cho&s;en; and he, in many in&s;tances, confirmed his power &s;o as to become a king. Had there been no wars, there would have been no kings: and the mythology of all kings being de&s;cended of the god of war is plain truth. But it has not yet been remarked, that, in early &s;ociety, even monarchy is democratical. The king is but one of the people. In the Greek heroic ages there were kings, becau&s;e there had been wars, yet the people was free even to licence. Dr. Gillies has, in the &s;econd chapter of his hi&s;|tory of Greece, made a formal parallel between the Greek government of tho&s;e times, and that of the Germans, tho he &s;u&s;pected not the real cau&s;e of that identity, namely, that they were all one people. He well ob&s;erves that in freedom of debate in the public a&s;&s;emblies, and the privileges of liberty being pre&s;erved to the meane&s;t &s;ubject, and other points, there is a perfect re&s;emblance. The only difference he marks is, that beauty of the Greek character, prie&s;t and king being united in one per&s;on. Yet the earlie&s;t Greeks had &s;epa|rate prie&s;ts, and augurs, as the Germans; &s;o that this can hardly be called a difference. And among the Scandinavians in Iceland, the prie&s;t was al&s;o the magi&s;trate, and offered &s;acrifice in
<PB N="137" REF="603">the mid&s;t of the judicial circle of &s;tones before he &s;at to judge.</P>
<P>The Feudal Sy&s;tem has been treated of by many writers, but &s;o uncommon a quality is pe|netration, that all of them to this day have con|founded two grand divi&s;ions in it's hi&s;tory, which are totally di&s;&s;imilar. The&s;e divi&s;ions are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Feudal Sy&s;tem.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Corrupted Feudal Sy&s;|tem.</ITEM>
</LIST>
The former extends from the earlie&s;t account of time, thro the early hi&s;tory of Greece and Rome, till the progre&s;s of &s;ociety changed the manners of the&s;e nations: and thro the early hi&s;|tory of the Goths and Germans who overturned the Roman empire, down to the eleventh century. At this period commences the Corrupted Feudal Sy&s;tem, and la&s;ts till the fifteenth century, when the Feudal Sy&s;tem began after it's corruption to di&s;&s;olve quite away. The Corruption of the Feu|dal Sy&s;tem took place &s;oon after the petty king|doms of the former ages were united into great monarchies, as the heptarchies in England be|came &s;ubject to our monarch; and &s;o in other countries. This corruption is no more the feudal &s;y&s;tem than any other corruption is the &s;ub&s;tance preceding corruption, that is quite the rever&s;e: and yet, &s;uch is modern &s;uperficiality, that it has been termed The Feudal Sy&s;tem, <GAP DESC="foreign"> and all writers e&s;timate the Feudal Sy&s;tem by it's cor|ruption only, ju&s;t as if we &s;hould judge of a re|public by it's condition when changed into an ari&s;tocracy! About the Eleventh century, by the change of &s;mall kingdoms into one great mo|narchy, and by a concatenation of other cau&s;es, which it would require a volume to detail, the Feudal Sy&s;tem corrupted, (and <HI>corruptio optimi pe&s;&s;ima</HI>) into a &s;tate of ari&s;tocratic tyranny, and oppre&s;&s;ion. Before that period no &s;uch matter can be found. The greate&s;t cau&s;e was, that no|bility and e&s;tates annexed were not hereditary till that time, &s;o that the great were kept in perpetual
<PB N="138" REF="604">awe; and that check was removed, before the cities had attained &s;uch privileges and powers, as to balance the nobility. In Ancient Greece and Italy, confined &s;pots, cities were from the fir&s;t the grand receptacles of &s;ociety. To the want of ci|ties the &s;ubjection of the people to their lords, and all the Corrupt Feudal Sy&s;tem is owing. To cities the ruin of that Corrupted Feudal Sy&s;tem (generally called the Feudal Sy&s;tem), is &s;olely to be a&s;cribed. Of the Corrupted Feudal Sy&s;tem no|thing &s;hall be added here; as it commenced at a late period, and is foreign to my work; &s;ave one or two remarks on Chivalry, an in&s;titution quite mi&s;under&s;tood. It was &s;o heterogeneous to the Feudal Sy&s;tem, that, had the later la&s;ted pure, chivalry would never have appeared. But as it is often &s;o decreed that, out of the corruption of a con&s;titution, a remedy for that corruption &s;prings, &s;uch was the ca&s;e with chivalry, an in&s;titution which does honour to human nature. The knight|hood was not hereditary, but an honour of per&s;o|nal worth. It's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were bound to help the oppre&s;&s;ed, and curb the tyrannic &s;pirit of the hereditary great, tho&s;e giants of power, and of romance. Had the ridicule of Cervantes appeared three centuries &s;ooner, we mu&s;t have branded him as the greate&s;t enemy of &s;ociety that ever wrote. As it is, a &s;en&s;ible French writer<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Le Grand, in his curious and amu&s;ing <HI>Fabliaux ou Contes du xii. et du xiii. Siccle</HI> (tran&s;lated into modern French) Paris 1781, 5 vols, 12<HI>mo.</HI></NOTE> well ob&s;erves, that it now begins to be que&s;tioned whether his book be not worthy of execration. All profe&s;&s;ions have their foibles; but ridicule ought never to be exerted again&s;t the benefit of &s;ociety. Cervantes envied the &s;ucce&s;s of the romances; but ought not to have derided an in&s;titution &s;o beneficial, be|cau&s;e even fables concerning it had the fortune to delight his cotemporaries.

Xenophon<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">De Exped. Cyri, lib. I.</NOTE> tells us that, when the younger Cyrus came to Cilicia, he was met by Epyaxa, the beautiful wife of the &s;atrap, who, according to the cu&s;tom of the ea&s;t, pre&s;ented her acknowledged liegelord and &s;uperior with gold, &s;ilver, and other precious gifts. Indeed the feudal &s;y&s;tem, about which &s;o much noi&s;e is made, is the natural fruit of conque&s;t, and is as old in the world as conque&s;t. A terri|tory is acquired, and the &s;tate, or the general, be|&s;tows it on the leaders, and &s;oldiers, on condition of military &s;ervice, and of tokens acknowleging gratitude to the donors. It was known in the Greek heroic ages. It was known to Lycurgus, for all the lands of Sparta were held on military tenure. It was known to Romulus, when he re|gulated Rome. It was known to Augu&s;tus, when he gave lands to his veterans, on condition that their &s;ons &s;hould, at fifteen years of age, do mili|tary &s;ervice. The rea&s;on it did not preponderate and corrupt in Greece and Rome was, that it was &s;tifled by the nece&s;&s;ary effects of cities, as above|mentioned. In Per&s;ia, where there were no cities

<P>The feudal &s;y&s;tem, whether in its original de|mocracy, or corrupted into ari&s;toracy, mu&s;t limit the power of kings; for men who hold their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions on military &s;ervice, mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, have arms in their hands: and even in ab&s;olute govern|ments the &s;oldiers are free, witne&s;s the praetorian bands and armies of imperial Rome, and the Turki&s;h jani&s;aries. By the feudal &s;y&s;tem every man held arms, and freedom, in his hands. Monte&s;quieu has begun his account of the feudal &s;y&s;tem with that of the ancient Germans, given by Tacitus; and prides him&s;elf in leaving off where others began. A writer more profound would leave off where Monte&s;quieu begins.</P>
<P>The ideas of mo&s;t writers concerning the Eng|li&s;h con&s;titution are extremely &s;hallow. It was not found, as Monte&s;quieu &s;tates, in the woods of Germany. It peculiarly belongs to a pa&s;toral &s;tate of &s;ociety, as may be inferred from Monte&s;|quieu him&s;elf<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">E&s;prit des Loix. liv. xxx.</NOTE>. The Scythic progre&s;s may almo&s;t be traced by &s;imilar forms of government prevail|ing; and it might be argued from this, that it was the con&s;titution even of the fir&s;t Scythic em|pire. To England it mu&s;t have come with the Belgae; for from Tacitus we know that it was that of all the Germans, and the Belgae were Germans. It is found wherever the Goths went. In the woods of Germany every man had a voice in the general council<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">De minoribus rebus principes con&s;ultant: de majoribus OMNES. Tacit. Germ.</NOTE>. This was when every man had no trade, &s;ave that of &s;oldier: but in a more ad|vanced &s;tate of &s;ociety other occupations aro&s;e, upon which men &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and could not neglect to attend to public bu&s;ine&s;s. They therefore looked on the chiefs, who had nothing el&s;e to do, as their
<PB N="141" REF="609">natural repre&s;entatives, and left public bu&s;ine&s;s to them. During this &s;tage of &s;ociety, the chiefs, and <HI>probi homines,</HI> men of rank and character, were really regarded as repre&s;entatives of the commu|nity, as implied by the common form in old laws, <HI>et tota communitas regni no&s;tri,</HI> for how could the community's con&s;ent be &s;pecified, &s;ave by the peers and <HI>probi homines,</HI> who repre&s;ented them? When the Goths overturned the Roman empire, they had a fixt aver&s;ion to towns, as they had long after; and the towns were left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the old inhabitants, who could hold no part in the con&s;titution of the victors. It is therefore ridicu|lous to &s;uppo&s;e repre&s;entatives of towns. In a third, and la&s;t &s;tage, difference of occupations had, by degrees, introduced trade; and trade introduced towns endued with privileges to protect it, or in other words, burghs. The&s;e, we are told, were fir&s;t founded in Germany, in the tenth century, In other countries they are later. Under the Ro|man empire there were many privileged towns; but their privileges were annihilated by the con|que&s;t of the Goths, who had brought from their woods a contempt and aver&s;ion for towns, as re|ceptacles of vice and effeminacy. When in ad|vanced &s;ociety, the Gothic victors allowed privi|leged towns, or burghs, the nobles had great en|mity to them, and con&s;tant conte&s;ts with the citi|zens; becau&s;e, among other privileges, a &s;lave who lived a year and day in a burgh, obtained his freedom, and the nobles thus lo&s;t many &s;laves. Thus aro&s;e the fir&s;t difference of intere&s;ts between lords and commons; for before this the former had been regarded as natural repre&s;entatives of the latter. Other repre&s;entatives were of cour&s;e ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and were con&s;tituted accordingly.</P>

A profound remark truly, and mo&s;t &s;agacious! Is it a regular plan now? Did regular plans of government ever exi&s;t, &s;ave in Utopias? Have not all governments, &s;ave de&s;poti&s;m, been ever totally irregular? While a man has life, his pul&s;e mu&s;t be liable to irregularities; when he is dead, it is regular enough! Error mu&s;t attend free will; and irregularity free government: the more irregular, the more free, as in the Greek democra|cies. Strange that Mr. Hume &s;hould forget his own ju&s;t remark, "Where any power or preroga|tive is fully and undoubtedly e&s;tabli&s;hed, the exerci&s;e of it pa&s;&s;es for a thing of cour&s;e, and readily e&s;capes the notice of hi&s;tory and annals." <HI>E&s;&s;ays,</HI> Vol. I. p. 499.

Our old hi&s;torians, who knew nothing of whig or tory &s;y&s;tem-building, knew the privileges of the commons well. Let us give one in&s;tance, and that from the middle of that very period when the privileges of the commons are con&s;idered as a&s;leep. Roger Hoveden, who wrote about 1190, &s;ays, that on the death of Edwy, king of the We&s;t Saxons, in 959, Edgar, king of Mercia, was elected by the Engli&s;h people king of all Eng|land,

Thrace, A&s;ia Mi|nor, Illyricum, Greece, were certainly peopled with Scythae at lea&s;t 1500 years before Chri&s;t; Italy at lea&s;t 1000. Nations that &s;ub&s;i&s;t by hunting and pa&s;turage, as the barbaric Scythae require a prodigious extent of territoryto afford means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; and their &s;peedy progre&s;s and population we may judge of from tho&s;e of the Tartars.

<PB N="144" REF="612">con&s;iderable period for their progre&s;s. From He|rodotus, and other ancients, it is certain that the scythians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Germany, nay had driven the Celts to the furthe&s;t we&s;t of Gaul, at lea&s;t 500 years before our aera. And there are rea&s;ons again&s;t placing this event at a much remoter period; &s;o that this may &s;afely be con&s;idered as being as near the aera as po&s;&s;ible in a ca&s;e of this nature.</P>
<P>Before clo&s;ing this chapter, it is proper to add a few remarks on the migrations of Scythians from Germany, before the Chri&s;tian epoch. Cae&s;ar in|forms us, that the Belgae, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t valiant part of the Gauls, were Germans; and Strabo confirms this account. The whole <HI>Provin|cia Romanorum,</HI> or <HI>Gallia Braccata,</HI> was al&s;o po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by Germans, as the name <HI>Braccata</HI> &s;hews, for breeches were the peculiar badge of the Scy|thae. Cae&s;ar indeed in&s;tructs us, that the Celts, or old Gauls, were bounded by the Seine on the north, and Garonne on the &s;outh. The learned and judicious Schoepflin<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">In his <HI>Vindiciae Celticae,</HI> Argent. 1754, 4<HI>to.</HI> a pamphlet which may be regarded as a model for enquiries of the kind: the whole authorities are given in chronologic order; and yet the work is brief, as well as accurate, and complete.</NOTE> has &s;ufficiently &s;hewn that the name of Celts was re&s;tricted to the Gauls alone; but has unhappily forgotten that only one third part of the Gauls were Celts. Hence his account of the Celtic colonies, is radically errone|ous; for all the&s;e colonies were of German Gauls. Indeed rea&s;on might convince us, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for the Celts, who had been expelled and confined by the Belgae, or Germans upon one &s;ide, and by the Aquitani, or Iberi on the other, to &s;end out colonies among tho&s;e very enemies who&s;e &s;uperior courage had vanqui&s;hed them, and &s;eized a great part of their territory. This could be put beyond doubt by a &s;pecial examination of the&s;e colonies, which, tho i have ample materials for,
<PB N="145" REF="613">yet i am with reluctance obliged to &s;uppre&s;s, as too large for the pre&s;ent de&s;ign.</P>
<P>But to give a few hints. The reader mu&s;t ever remember in this que&s;tion, that the name of <HI>Celts</HI> was not only given peculiarly and properly to the real Celts, who, in Cae&s;ar's time, were confined to one third part of Gaul; but was al&s;o given, laxly and improperly, by many ancient writers to all the Gauls. For as the Celts had anciently po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed all Gaul, their name was continued by &s;ome, and by the di&s;tant Greek writers e&s;pecially, to all the Gauls: tho the Belgae, and Aquitani, the Galli Braccati, and others, or the far greater part of the Gauls, were not Celts, but expellers of the Celts. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame as that of the Engli&s;h, who are called Britons, not as being old Britons, but as expellers of tho&s;e Britons, and as living in Britain. So the Briti&s;h of America are called Americans, not as being American &s;avages, but as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of that country. Thus the Ger|mans who had &s;eized on mo&s;t of Gaul, and had come in place of the Celts, are called Gauls by the Romans; and Celts by many of the Greeks, and by &s;ome Romans. The que&s;tion always remains, which Gauls are meant by the former, and which Celts by the later.</P>
<P>The Celts who pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Spain</HI> were certainly of Gallia Braccata, which bordered on Spain; and not real old Celts, who, &s;o far from &s;ending colonies into Spain, were driven from their &s;outhern territories by the Aquitani, a Spani&s;h people. The&s;e <HI>Celtiberi</HI> and <HI>Celtici</HI> of Spain are the only Gaulic colonies which obtain the appellation of Celts in Roman writers, who call the others Gauls. A &s;ingularity which proceeded from this, that the Romans received their fir&s;t intelligence concerning Spain from the Greeks of Mar&s;eilles, who called all the Gauls Celts: and thus retained the old name, by which they had found the people di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Greeks, and perhaps by the Carthaginians.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="614">The Belgae of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> are out of all que&s;tion; for it is known to a certainly that the Belgae were not Celts but Germans.</P>
<P>The Gauls of <HI>Ci&s;alpine Gaul,</HI> or of <HI>Italy,</HI> were infallibly German Gauls. The former region was called <HI>Gallia Togata,</HI> for it's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, from their neighbourhood with the civilized Etru&s;cans, and Greeks of Mar&s;eilles, were the fir&s;t who were civilized, and abandoned their rude dre&s;s for that of their polite neighbours: while their brethren further off retained the Gothic <HI>braccae,</HI> and gave name to Gallia Braccata. The Celts were remote from Ci&s;alpine Gaul; while it was &s;urrounded by Ger|mans on the north, and by other Germans of Gallia Braccata on the we&s;t. And that the Ci&s;al|pine Gauls were not old Celts who retained po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the country, is clear from Livy and Poly|bius, who relate their pa&s;&s;age into Italy; and the former dates it in the time of Tarquinius Pri&s;cus, about the period of the foundation Mar&s;eilles by the Greeks: that is, about 589 years before Chri&s;t by common accounts, but by Sir I&s;aac Newton's rectified chronology of Rome about 500. It is well known that the Roman hi&s;tory, for the three or four fir&s;t centuries, is very uncertain, becau&s;e there were neither writers, nor records of any kind: and Livy, in relating this very remote event, gives it as a &s;tory of ye&s;terday, with all its circum&s;tances, which &s;ufficiently indicates that he u&s;ed poetical and fabulous liberty here, as in all the ancient parts of his work. Hence we need only read this tale to deny faith to it's circum&s;tances; tho the ground-work be confirmed by the grave te&s;timony of Poly|bius; and it is beyond doubt, from many concur|ring ancients, that the Ci&s;alpine Gauls had pa&s;&s;ed into Italy at a late period, and were not ancient inhabitants. But Livy in compo&s;ing his tale con|cerning an event 500 years old, and of which he could have no circum&s;tantial evidence whatever, found that Polybius, a Greek writer, and perhaps
<PB N="147" REF="615">other Greeks of Mar&s;eilles, called the Ci&s;alpine Gauls, as they did all the Gauls, Celts. Hence, knowing al&s;o, as the pa&s;&s;age &s;hews, that the Celts of his time were but a third part of the Gauls, he un|der&s;tood the Celts, laxly &s;o called by the Greeks, to be the Celts proper; and has of cour&s;e formally derived the Ci&s;alpine Gauls from the Celts proper. Pelloutier draws the names given by Livy, <HI>Ambi|gatus, Bellove&s;us, Sigove&s;us,</HI> from the Tude&s;que or German Gothic. But, tho &s;uch erymology is un|certain, yet the frequency of &s;imilar names among the Germans de&s;erves notice. The <HI>Ambi</HI>-variti were a Belgic tribe: <HI>Ambi</HI>-orix was prince of the Ebu|rones, a Belgic people (and the <HI>rix</HI> is an infalli|bly Gothic termination, common to this day, Theodoric, Frederic, &amp;c. &amp;c.) The <HI>Bello</HI>-va&s;&s;i were a Belgic tribe, as were the <HI>Bello</HI>-ca&s;&s;i. <HI>Sege</HI>-&s;tes, <HI>Segi</HI>-merus, <HI>Segi</HI>-mundus, are German names in Tacitus. The manners of the Ci&s;alpine Gauls, de&s;cribed by Polybius, II. 4. are German. Diodorus Siculus di&s;tingui&s;hes the Senones (who took Rome) from the Celts, and calls them North|ern Gauls. They were of the <HI>Semnones</HI> of Germany.</P>
<P>The Gauls who long contended with the Ger|mans in prowe&s;s, and who &s;ettled a colony or two in the &s;outh of <HI>Germany,</HI> were German Gauls. Cae&s;ar tells us that the Belgae were in continual war with the Germans, as indeed the German nations were among them&s;elves. The Helvetii, Boii, Tecto&s;ages, were German Gauls, who had warred with their ance&s;tors, and &s;ettled among them. The Germans of Southern Gaul being far &s;uperior in civilization to their progenitors, and refined by climate, neighbourhood, and commerce, were of cour&s;e often &s;uperior in war; a circum&s;tance which might have &s;imply ari&s;en from better weapons. The Gallic colonies in <HI>Illyricum</HI> and <HI>Thrace</HI> are of the &s;ame de&s;cription. Livy (XL. 57.) tells, that the Scordi&s;ci and Tauri&s;ci were of one &s;peech with
<PB N="148" REF="616">the Ba&s;ternae, and they were of cour&s;e German Gauls.</P>
<P>That famous expedition, which founded the kingdom of Galatia in <HI>A&s;ia Minor,</HI> was al&s;o of German Gauls. The people were Trocmi, Tec|to&s;ages, and Toli&s;toboii: the leaders Lomnorius, and Lutarius; the later being the German name Lutharius or Lothaire. Saint Jerome<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">In praef. Epi&s;t. 1. ad Galat.</NOTE> puts the German extraction of the Galatians beyond doubt, by telling us, from per&s;onal knowlege, that their &s;peech was the &s;ame with that of Treveri or Triers in Germany, where he had &s;tudied. So much for the German-Gallic colonies, which the bounds of my de&s;ign forbid me to examine at due length<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><P>As in America the Europeans not only have va&s;t di&s;tinct po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but al&s;o towns and &s;ettlements among the &s;avages, &s;uch we may judge was the ca&s;e with the Scythians among the Celts. In celtic Gaul e&s;pecially many Belgic tribes and towns may be found; and it may be inferred that the Celtic parts of Britain and Ireland were in the &s;ame predicament. Strabo, lib.

Not the Samnians, not the Cartha|ginians, not the mingled nations of Spain, and of Gaul, nor even the Parthians them&s;elves, were &s;o dangerous to Roman power. Carbo, and Ca&s;&s;ius, Scaurus Aurelius, and Servilius Cepio, and Marcus Manlius, with their five con&s;ular armies, were all taken pri&s;oners or &s;lain by the Teutones and Cimbri, who had fled from the northern Germans. Julius declined the conte&s;t with the Germans: Augu&s;tus weeped the fate of Varus and his legions. Hardly could Dru&s;us, and
<PB N="149" REF="617">Nero, and Germanicus, defend this frontier of the empire, for this was the whole ambition of Rome. In later times they were triumphed over, but not conquered. Under their ancient name of Scythae or Goths, they were &s;oon, by degrees, to &s;eize on the whole we&s;tern empire; nay to pour over the fertile coa&s;ts of Africa. The Vandali, whom Tacitus and Pliny found in the north of Germany, were to fight with Beli&s;arius, in the plains of Numidia. The Suevi were to po&s;&s;e&s;s the fragrant fields of Spain. The Langobardi were to enjoy the orange groves of Italy. The Angli, whom Tacitus puts in a li&s;t of names, were to give their name to a country eminent in arts and arms, in wi&s;dom and liberty.</P>

<HEAD>The progre&s;s of the Scythians into Scandinavia e&s;pecially con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>SO much has been written, by many of the mo&s;t learned men whom Europe has produced, upon the imaginary egre&s;&s;ion of the Scythians or Goths from Scandinavia, that this part of my &s;ubject well de&s;erves a particular inve&s;tigation. The Scythic or Gothic language, mythology, and manners, have al&s;o been &s;o much pre&s;erved in the wilds of Iceland, which was colonized from Nor|way in the Ninth century, and have been &s;o ably illu&s;trated by the erudition of different Scandinavian antiquaries, that the progre&s;s of the Scythae into Scandinavia becomes a &s;ubject extremely curious and intere&s;ting. My particular view, which was to illu&s;trate the hi&s;tory of the Piks, a people who proceeded from Norway to the north of Britain, about three centuries before Chri&s;t, likewi&s;e con|curs to draw my be&s;t attention to this point, upon which i hope exten&s;ive reading on the &s;ubject, and &s;edulous and minute re&s;earch, will enable me to throw new lights.</P>
<P>The reader will plea&s;e to recollect that, before our proofs that the Germans were Scythae, the BASTERNAE attracted attention, as a people &s;ituated between the Getae and the Germans. But this va&s;t race of men, called Ba&s;ternae, not only reached down to the <HI>Alpes Ba&s;ternicae,</HI> or Carpathian moun|tains, and the Danube, but al&s;o extended north to that part of the Baltic where pre&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia now
<PB N="151" REF="619">lyes, and which is neare&s;t to the Euxine, the early &s;eat of the Scythae; the di&s;tance beween the Baltic and Euxine &s;eas, being only about 500 miles, little more than the breadth of the interme|diate country of pre&s;ent Poland. Over this tract of ground, about 500 miles long, from the Danube to the Baltic, and about 150 miles broad from the we&s;tern boundary of the Vi&s;tula, to the Chronus, and Bory&s;tenes on the ea&s;t, were &s;tationed the great BASTERNIC nations. For the Sarmatae were not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Poland, till the German nations began to move into the Roman empire; and the river Nieper or Bory&s;tenes, and Chronus now Niemen, were the proper bounds of ancient Sar|matia on the we&s;t. The we&s;t of Poland was a gradual acqui&s;ition of the Sarmatae, as the Scythae moved into the Roman empire: and in the fourth and fifth centuries, when the German Scythae were &s;till moving into richer countries, the Sarmatians, or <HI>Slavi</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Slava,</HI> in the Slavonic, means <HI>glorious, noble;</HI> hence many Poli&s;h names as Ladi <HI>&s;laus,</HI> &amp;c.

He al&s;o a&s;cribes na&s;tine&s;s to the Sarmatae, tho of this the Germans had their &s;hare; as all uncivi|lized nations mu&s;t have; and the Celts in particu|lar were &s;o filthy that even their cleanline&s;s was the extreme of na&s;tine&s;s<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Strabo, <HI>lib.</HI> III. p. 164, &s;ays, that the Celts wa&s;hed their body, and clean&s;ed their teeth, with urine; and that it was kept long in ci&s;terns to give it more &s;trength.</NOTE>. But the Sarmatians were a great and warlike nation; tho it appears, from the little mention of them in Greek and Roman hi&s;tory, that they yielded much to the Scythians in arms; and, from all ancient accounts, were al&s;o inferior in wi&s;dom, and &s;uch rude arts, as early &s;ociety affords, tho the pea&s;antry of Poland and Ru&s;&s;ia be remarkably &s;en&s;ible and acute.</P>
<P>The BASTERNAE, in this large extent of country, became &s;o remarkable to the ancients, that Strabo, book VII. p. 305, cla&s;&s;es them with the enormous names of SCYTHAE and SARMATAE, &s;aying that the Scythae, Ba&s;ternae, and Sarmatae, beyond the Danube, gradually emigrated north. He al&s;o in|forms us that the Ba&s;ternae were divided into four great nations, ATMONOI, <GAP DESC="foreign">; the <HI>Atmoni, Sitones, Peukini,</HI> and <HI>Roxolani.</HI> Some of them, he ob&s;erves, re|mained &s;till in Thrace, and their fir&s;t habitations; while others moved north. The Peukini, tho they &s;ent out va&s;t emigrations, form a remarkable in|&s;tance of tho&s;e who remained. Let us briefly confider the BASTERNAE, of whom the Peukini were a part, in order that the reader may &s;ee the progre&s;&s;ive evidence of the ancients who have mentioned them concerning both. The fir&s;t mention we find of the <HI>Ba&s;ternae</HI> in hi&s;tory is on account of their a&s;&s;i&s;ting Per&s;eus, king of Macedon, again&s;t the Romans, 166 years before Chri&s;t. Polybius, who was cotemporary, men|tions that Per&s;eus was a&s;&s;i&s;ted with 10,000 <HI>Ba&s;ternae

Upon which Pelloutier folli&s;hly concludes them Celts, quite forgetting that the Celts were not Gauls, but only a people of Gaul, and the mo&s;t di&s;tant of all; the whole German Gauls being the people gener|ally called Gauls by the ancients, and being the neare&s;t to the &s;cene of action, and to Italy. Tho&s;e French authors who finding the Celts peculiarly and originally in Gaul, and therefore &s;ometimes called Gauls, as we call the Welch, Britons, be|cau&s;e they anciently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole country; and who from thence gratify their dreams of uni|ver&s;al dominion, by wi&s;hing to prove the whole of Europe Celtic, only &s;hew an ignorance and folly beyond all exce&s;s. What &s;hould we &s;ay of him, who, finding the Welch peculiarly called Britons, and that North America was peopled from Britain, &s;hould in &s;ome future period, dream that all the Briti&s;h inhabitants of North America are Welch?

The other Ger|mans, being the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;ettlement of the Scythae, and bordering on the Celts, who had by the Greeks of Mar&s;eilles been taught many civil arts, had on the contrary advanced one &s;tage fur|ther in &s;ociety than their Scythian ance&s;tors: as we ob&s;erved before that the Greeks, another Scy|thian &s;ettlement, had, from &s;till greater advantages of &s;ituation, advanced even to the height of hu|man perfection, while their ance&s;tors were in pri|mitive barbari&s;m.

The <HI>Jazyges Eneocadlae,</HI> as above &s;hewn, were a &s;mall Sarmatic nation, who lived in peace and union among the Getae, on the north of the Tyras, acting it is likely as cavalry in their armies; and it is probable it was of them that Ovid learned Sarmatic. The other nations were al&s;o north of the Danube, to the &s;outh of which Tomi, the place of Ovid's bani&s;hment, &s;tood: and the Col|chians here mentioned were, in all probability, the Peukini. For tho the Piki were properly one of the many Scythian tribes between Colchis and the Ceraunian mountains; yet being &s;ubject to the great Colchian kingdom they were probably called Colchians, as foreigners call all the natives of Bri|tain and Ireland, Engli&s;h. But leaving this con|jecture (for it is little better) to carry it's own weight with the reader, i &s;hall proceed to examine the progre&s;s of the Ba&s;ternae.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peukini,</HI> or that Ba&s;ternic nation which emigrated from Peuk&eacute;, &s;eem to have in proce&s;s of time tran&s;cended all the other Ba&s;ternic divi&s;ions in number. In&s;omuch that Pliny and Tacitus put the Ba&s;ternae and Peukini as names of the &s;ame nation; tho Strabo, Ptolemy, and others, writing geography and of cour&s;e more accurately in the&s;e points, but the Peukini as only one of the divi&s;ions of Ba&s;ternae. The <HI>Roxolani</HI> Strabo put by mi&s;take among the Ba&s;ternae, for it is known to a certainty from Tacitus, <HI>Hi&s;t. lib.</HI> 1. (<HI>Roxolani Sarmatica gens,</HI> &amp;c.) and many others, that they were Sarma|tae. Strabo's mi&s;take aro&s;e from the Roxolani being the next Sarmatic nation to the Ba&s;ternae.

Pliny III. 25, tells us, that Callimachus placed a people called <HI>Peuketi</HI> in Liburnia of Illyricum. In Italy direct|ly on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore were the <HI>Pikeni:</HI> and further &s;outh, lay the large country of <HI>Peuketia,</HI> now Apulia, of which much may be found in Stra|bo. Pliny, III. 16. &s;ays it was &s;o called from Peuketius brother of Oenotrus; and Diony&s;. Hal. book 1. p. 10, 11, <HI>ed. Hud&s;on,</HI> &s;ays Oenotrus and Peuketius were the two fir&s;t leaders of colonies from Greece into Italy. It was the cu&s;tom of the Greeks always to derive names of nations from ancient kings and chiefs. This was ea&s;y etymology, and co&s;t nothing, yet co&s;t as much as etymology of names is worth. Thus the Lydians were from Lydus, the My&s;ians from My&s;us, the Scythians from Scythes, the Celts from Celtes, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and the Aborigines of the &s;outh we&s;t &s;hore of Italy Oenotrians, from Oenotrus, who led them from Arcadia, and tho&s;e of the ea&s;t, Peuketii, from Peu|ketius his brother. The fact &s;eems that the&s;e
<PB N="158" REF="628">aborigines were Oenotri from the Peloponne&s;us, who advanced from the &s;outh we&s;t of Italy, upward along the we&s;t &s;hore; while the Peuketii &s;eized on the ea&s;t &s;ide from the oppo&s;ite &s;hores of Illyricum, where we learn from Callimachus that a part re|mained. The <HI>Pikentii</HI> on the we&s;t, as they bordered on old Peuketia, were as is likely of the &s;ame origin. But the&s;e ideas are given as mere conjectures; and i now proceed to examine the northern progre&s;s of the PEUKINI and SITONES, which &s;tands upon quite other grounds.</P>
<P>It is allowed that the Peukini received their name, and proceeded, from the iland of Peuk&eacute; (<GAP DESC="foreign">) in the Euxine &s;ea, at the mouth of the Danube, now Piczina, or Pics ile. This celebrated iland is finely de&s;cribed by Apollonius Rhodius in his exqui&s;ite poem, The Argonautics, written about 250 years before Chri&s;t. Thus the Peukini cer|tainly came from the very heart of Getia, Dacia, and Mae&s;ia; and, if not originally a colony of Colchian Scythae, certainly were a Scythic people, i&s;&s;uing from the very heart of a country, which was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Scythae about 2000 years before Chri&s;t.

The ancient author of the Argonautics a&s;cribed to Orpheus, calls the Peukini <HI>Pacti,</HI> when he de&s;cribes the Argonauts in their return &s;ailing up &s;ome river, from the Palus Maeotis, to the Cronian &s;ea, as he dreams; and ranges the Pacti with the Lelians, Scythians, Hyperboreans, Ripheans.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="629">Let us now briefly con&s;ider the Northern Pro|gre&s;s of the Sitones and Peukini, two grand Ba&s;|ternic divi&s;ions. Strabo, who wrote about 20 years after our aera, is certainly well informed con|cerning the north of Germany, as the Greeks actually traded to Pru&s;&s;ia for amber. In particu|lar the E&s;tii of pre&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia, from who&s;e coa&s;ts the amber came, and where it is yet found in &s;uch quantities as to yield a large revenue, were in the confines of the Peukini and Sitones, or Ba&s;ternic nations on the Baltic, &s;o that the intelli|gence concerning countries &s;o near that to which the Greeks traded, may be regarded as &s;atisfactory. Now he tells us, book VII. p. 294, that "mo&s;t think the Ba&s;ternae live beyond the Germans to the Northward, others that there is only ocean." That the later opinion was fal&s;e need not be told: but that the former was true, namely that the Ba&s;ternae po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Scandinavia, is certain; for Ta|citus, who was procurator of Gallia Belgica and had of cour&s;e all information relating to Germany, and it's neighbourhood, as his admirable <HI>Germania</HI> &s;hews, places the SITONES whom Strabo had men|tioned as one of the three Ba&s;ternic nations in pre&s;ent Sweden, and finds part of the PEUKINI on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, while a part no doubt had pa&s;&s;ed into Scandinavia with the Sitones their brethren. And it is evident that the Sitones, whom Ptolemy puts on the &s;outh of the Baltic between the Viader and Vi&s;tula, were a part of the Sitones who re|mained, while the re&s;t pa&s;&s;ed into Scandinavia: for migrations of nations were &s;eldom, if ever, complete, a circum&s;tance which enables us to trace their &s;teps.</P>
<P>The PEUKINI in particular, being the large&s;t and mo&s;t eminent part of the Ba&s;ternae, as we may judge from their name being often extended to the whole of this va&s;t people, leave &s;uch traces behind them from Thrace to the Baltic, that we can fol|low them &s;tep by &s;tep. This we are enabled to do
<PB N="160" REF="630">from the geography of Ptolemy, who wrote about 150 years after Chri&s;t. As one or two Sarmatic tribes extended beyond the Chronus and Bory&s;tenes, he improperly puts the Vi&s;tula as the boundary be|tween the Germans, and Sarmatae; tho Tacitus, who wrote about fifty years before, had &s;pecially mentioned German nations beyond the Vi&s;tula, and the va&s;t people of Peukini OR Ba&s;ternae in par|ticular, whom Pliny puts as one FIFTH part of the Germans. But Ptolemy living at the great di&s;|tance of Alexandria in Egypt, and probably not even under&s;tanding Latin, &s;eems never to have redd either Pliny or Tacitus; but puts his places according to the maps and Itineraries of the generals, and to the Greek geographers. From the later in particular, who drew from the merchants of amber good intelligence as to the pre&s;ent rout, the informa|tion &s;eems derived which is to be found in his chapter of Sarmatia Europaea. In his time a part of the Peukini &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their original &s;ettlement in Peuk&eacute; while we find another part far north of the Tyras, and above the Getae: and the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>Peukinian Mountains</HI> of Ptolemy are, as Cluverius ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, on the &s;outh we&s;t of pre&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia, near the head of the river Bog; that is within about &s;ixty miles of the Baltic &s;ea. Ptolemy places the Peukini on the north of the Ba&s;ternae: &s;o that of all the Ba&s;ternae they were neare&s;t to the Baltic. And that the Peukini actually reached to the Baltic, we know from Tacitus, who in the end of his Germania ranges them with the Venedi and Fenni, whom Ptolemy places near the Vi&s;tula upon the Baltic. Tacitus al&s;o puts the <HI>Venedi</HI> between the PEUKINI and <HI>Fenni,</HI> &s;o that the Peukini mu&s;t have been on the &s;hore of the Baltic, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the mouth of the Vi&s;tula, or in pre|&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia: from which they extended &s;outh to their Ba&s;ternic brethren in the we&s;tern part of pre&s;ent Hungary: a tract about 400 miles long, and from 100 to 150 broad. With &s;o large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions it is no
<PB N="161" REF="631">wonder that Pliny &s;hould put the Peukini as a fifth part of the Germans; and that their name &s;hould be u&s;ed as &s;ynonymous with the Ba&s;ternae.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn that the two Ba&s;ternic nations of PEUKINI and SITONES extended to the Baltic; and that, as Tacitus and others &s;hew, and all modern geographers agree, a part of the Sitones remained in the neighbourhood of the Peukini, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Baltic, while the re&s;t of the Sitones were in Scandinavia; and that Strabo mentions it as the mo&s;t general opinion in his time that the Ba&s;ternae were beyond the Germans, or in Scandinavia; i believe it will be granted at once that it is mo&s;t likely that a part of the Peukini went to Scandinavia with their brethren the Sitones. But, before in&s;i&s;ting on this, i &s;hall give the reader &s;ome idea of what the Romans and Greeks knew of Scandinavia and the north of Germany.</P>
<P>About 250 years before Chri&s;t, Pytheas and others, as we learn from Pliny, &s;poke of an iland called <HI>Baltia</HI> in the <HI>Cronium mare,</HI> or Northern ocean, whence amber was brought. Herodotus had indeed mentioned this 450 years before Chri&s;t. The name of the iland was palpably from the Baltic &s;ea very anciently &s;o called; from the Gothic, or old German <HI>Belt,</HI> a gulf. Amber was never found in Scandinavia, but in <HI>Gle&s;&s;aria,</HI> a penin&s;ula on the Pru&s;&s;ian coa&s;t, which afterward received it's name from the appellation which Tacitus tells the Germans gave amber, namely <HI>Gles</HI> or <HI>Gla&s;s,</HI> which it re&s;embled. Baltia is therefore not Scandinavia but Gle&s;&s;aria. Pomponius Mela, who wrote about 45 years after Chri&s;t, mentions the <HI>Codanus &s;inus,</HI> and <HI>Codanovia,</HI> which is in all probability pre&s;ent Zeeland, an ile of the Suiones, in which the capital of Denmark &s;tands; and from whence <HI>Dania</HI> is by &s;ome judged to be contracted. Pliny him&s;elf, who wrote about 70 years after Chri&s;t, is the fir&s;t who mentions <HI>Scandinavia,</HI> tho he tells us, IV. 16. that the iles of <HI>Scandia, Dumna, Bergi,</HI> and <HI>Nerigon,</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="632">had been noticed by others<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>He al&s;o names <HI>Eningia,</HI> which &s;ome would ra&s;hly alter to <HI>Finingia,</HI> but was in all likelihood the &s;outh part of Finland, and taken by the ancients for another ile in the Great Northern Ocean. Pliny &s;ays, Scandinavia and Eningia were thought other <HI>worlds</HI> by the inhabitants: but he u&s;es the &s;ame extravagant hyperbole in &s;peaking of Taprobane, or <HI>Ceylon!</HI> VI. 24.</P></NOTE>. Dumna is by Ptolemy ranged among the Orkneys; Scandia may be Funen; and Bergi the country of Bergen in Norway, inter|&s;ected from Sweden on the &s;outh by the <HI>Schager Rack,</HI> or we&s;terly divi&s;ion of the Baltic, &s;o as to have to tho&s;e who knew only the &s;outhern coa&s;t, the ap|pearance of an ile. Pliny adds IV. 16. that Ne|rigon was the large&s;t of the&s;e iles: and as he &s;ays he derives his information from various preceding au|thors <HI>&s;unt qui et alia prodeunt, Scandiam,</HI> &amp;c. it is well inferred by the northern antiquaries that Nerigon had from later and better information been put for Bergi; but Pliny finding the &s;ame country called by two names, thought them different iles: for Nerigon is &s;urely Norway by it's mo&s;t ancient, and yet indigenous name <HI>Norig&eacute;,</HI> or the Northern kingdom. But ch. 27, he tells us from him&s;elf that Scandinavia is an ile in the <HI>Sinus Codanus</HI> of undi&s;covered &s;ize, and that the known parts are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Hilleviones</HI> in five hundred <HI>pagi,</HI> or di&s;tricts. They are well thought to be of <HI>Halland</HI> in the &s;outh-we&s;t corner of Scandinavia.</P>
<P>Being now come to Tacitus, who&s;e <HI>Germania</HI> is &s;o important to modern hi&s;tory, it will be proper to dwell a little upon the geography of that work, which is in many points gro&s;&s;ly mi&s;under&s;tood; and e&s;pecially that part which concerns our &s;ubject, his de&s;cription of the northern nations. Cluverius, who wrote near two centuries ago, is univer&s;ally and blindly followed, while his faults are enormous. He was a man of laudable indu&s;try; but of con|tracted and indi&s;tinct judgment. If errors be ad|mitted into any branch of &s;cience, they commonly
<PB N="163" REF="633">remain for centuries, owing to the indolence of mankind, who are ever ready to re&s;ign their minds to any guide, and would rather &s;leep and go wrong, than examine and go right; while in fact they have only to tru&s;t them&s;elves more, and others le&s;s. Let us lay Tacitus before us, with a map of modern Germany; and put a&s;ide Cluverius, Cellarius, and the able D'Anville, who has &s;o often corrected their ea&s;tern geography, but has tru&s;ted them with Germany, their own country, and thus left Europe in darkne&s;s to enlighten A&s;ia. Tacitus, after em|ploying two thirds of his work in de&s;cribing the manners of the Germans, pa&s;&s;es to a de&s;cription of the nations; and fir&s;t mentions two colonies which had returned from Gaul into Germany, the <HI>Helvetii</HI> and <HI>Boii.</HI> He then puts the <HI>Vangiones,</HI> &amp;c. on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Rhine; and the <HI>Batavi</HI> in the ile formed by its outlets. Beyond the people between the head of the Danube, and the Rhine, he places the <HI>Catti,</HI> a large nation; and further up on the the Rhine the <HI>U&s;pii,</HI> &amp;c.; next the <HI>Bructeri;</HI> be|hind them, the <HI>Dulgibini;</HI> in front, the <HI>Fri&s;ii,</HI> who &s;pred along the north bank of the Rhine and the ocean: and among whom was the Zuyder Zee, <HI>ambiuntque immen&s;os in&s;uper lacus, et Romanis cla&s;&s;i|bus navigatos.</HI> Tacitus adds, <HI>Hactenus in Occidentem Germaniam novimus. In Septentrionem ingenti flexu re|dit.</HI> 'Thus far we know of the we&s;t of Germany. It now returns to the north with a great bend;' meaning that it's &s;hore, formerly we&s;t, now fronts north, as it does at pre&s;ent Friezland and Gronin|gen. Next is the very large nation of the <HI>Chauci:</HI> then the <HI>Cheru&s;ci,</HI> and <HI>Fo&s;i,</HI> the la&s;t of whom are fooli&s;hly taken for the Saxons by Cluverius, who forgot that the Saxons were an alliance of many nations which like the Franks and Allmans had taken one name. Here in a &s;pot which an&s;wers to the mouth of the Elbe, <HI>proximi Oceano,</HI> dwelled the &s;mall and only remains of the Cimbri: <HI>parva nunc civitas.</HI> This <HI>parva civitas</HI> geographers &s;pread over all the large penin&s;ula of Jutland, which after Ptolemy,
<PB N="164" REF="634">(who only puts a few Cimbri in it, and no le&s;s than Six German nations) they call the Cimbric Cher|&s;one&s;us. It was doubtle&s;s once inhabited by the Cimbri, but they were reduced to a <HI>parva civitas</HI> at its &s;outhwe&s;t corner, long before Roman geography commences.</P>
<P>Tacitus next proceeds to the <HI>Suevi,</HI> who, he tells us, were not one nation, but many under one title, who held the greate&s;t part of Germany, to wit, all from the Danube to the ocean &s;outh and north, and from the Elbe to the vi&s;tula ea&s;t and we&s;t. The fir&s;t are the <HI>Semnones,</HI> a people of a hundred di&s;tricts, who are rightly placed in <HI>Brandenburg.</HI> Proceeding to the north, as is clear from his expre&s;&s;ion when he pa&s;&s;es to the Hermunduri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> (<HI>ut quo modo paulo ante Rhenum, &s;ic nunc Danubium &s;equar,</HI> for the Rhine runs north, the Danube ea&s;t) next to the Semnones are the <HI>Langobardi,</HI> about pre&s;ent Lunenburg. Then follow no le&s;s than &s;even nations, all of which Cluverius has heaped upon one another in pre&s;ent Mecklenburg! The poor man forgot that the whole va&s;t penin&s;ula of Jutland was ju&s;t in the road of Tacitus, as his text bears that he proceeds north; and that he adds <HI>haec quidem pars Suevorum in</HI> SECRETIORA <HI>Germaniae</HI> PORRIGITUR, a de&s;cription which can only apply to this va&s;t and rich penin|&s;ula; and that the Cimbri with whom he fills that large Cher&s;one&s;e were, as Tacitus &s;ays, only a &s;mall &s;tate on the ocean near the Cheru&s;ci and Fo&s;i, or at the mouth of the Elbe! Seven nations are piled upon one another in a &s;mall province; and a <HI>parva civitas</HI> is &s;pred over a territory 220 miles long, and from 63 to 95 broad! If this be not ab&s;urdity, i know not what ab&s;urdity is. But &s;uch is human &s;cience! Let us place the&s;e nations as Tacitus meaned, and all is well. The <HI>Reudigni</HI> fir&s;t, and <HI>Aviones</HI> above them, in pre&s;ent Hol&s;tein; the <HI>Angli</HI> in Sle&s;wick, where the fertile province of Anglen &s;preads around Lunden it's ancient capital: the <HI>Varini</HI> above the Angli, for the river Warne is
<PB N="165" REF="635">nothing; the <HI>Eudo&s;es</HI> next; then the <HI>Suardones</HI> and <HI>Nuithones</HI> in pre&s;ent North Jutland, the later reaching to it's utmo&s;t point where the promontory of Scagen braves the northern ocean. As to the Angli we are certain. The Suardones were perhaps the <HI>Swathedi,</HI> whom the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians Henry of Huntingdon, Roger Hoveden, Matthew of We&s;t|min&s;ter, commemorate among the Dani&s;h invaders of England in the ninth and tenth centuries. The Nuithones are, as is likely, the <HI>Huithoni</HI> of Ponta|nus in his <HI>De&s;criptio Daniae,</HI> that is, the inhabitants of the furthe&s;t point of Jutland, the Witland of Bleau's Atlas. The Eudo&s;es are the <HI>Yeuton,</HI> or people of Yeutland, as the Danes pronounce Jutland, who &s;eem to have been the large&s;t nation holding the middle of the Cher&s;one&s;e, and who now give a general name to the whole penin&s;ula of Northern and Southern Jutland. Let me add, that it is impo&s;&s;ible that the whole of this penin&s;ula, as nearer the Roman provinces of Upper and Lower Germany, &s;hould not have been far better known to the Romans, than the &s;outhern &s;hores of the Baltic.</P>
<P>Accordingly we find Ptolemy, fifty years after Tacitus, places no le&s;s than &s;ix nations in it, the <HI>Sigulones, Sabelingii, Cobandi, Chali, Phundu&s;iii, Charudes,</HI> be&s;ides the Saxons at it's &s;outh part: and the Cimbri, whom Ptolemy ignorantly places at it's northern extremity. Ignorantly, for no man can prefer Ptolemy's te&s;timony, who lived at Alexandria, to that of Tacitus, who lived in Bel|gic Gaul, and who expre&s;&s;ly puts the Cimbri on the &s;ea&s;ide of the Fo&s;i, at the mouth of the Elbe. The reader need not be told that the text of Ptolemy is rightly deemed the mo&s;t corrupt of all antiquity; as indeed a con&s;tant &s;eries of unknown names, and numbers, mu&s;t have been lyable to great vitia|tions of copiers. His account of the names of the German nations often differs from Tacitus; yet Strabo confirms Tacitus, tho he wrote before him, for Strabo's work was not &s;o lyable to vitiation,
<PB N="166" REF="636">being narrative, while Ptolemy's only contains geographic tables. The Phundu&s;ii &s;eem the Eudo&s;es; the Charudes, the Suardones: the others are yet more corrupt, for tho&s;e given by Tacitus can be traced in the &s;pot, and in hi&s;tory, but of tho&s;e a&s;&s;igned by Ptolemy, not one. Yet Ptole|my places none of the nations above mentioned el&s;ewhere, &s;ave the Angili Suevi, and it is doubt|ful if the&s;e were the Angli<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The&s;e <HI>Anglii</HI> of Ptolemy are corrupted from <HI>Angrii,</HI> or <HI>Angrivarii,</HI> placed by others ju&s;t where Ptolemy puts the <HI>Anglii.</HI></NOTE>. Tacitus ob&s;erves of the&s;e nations that they are divided by rivers and woods; a de&s;cription mo&s;t applicable to Jutland, now &s;o well wooded, and inter&s;ected by fine &s;treams. Perhaps it may be &s;aid that Tacitus would have mentioned this great Cher&s;one&s;e expre&s;&s;ly, had he meant it; but it is doubtful if it was called a Cher&s;one&s;e, &s;ave by Ptolemy only; and it's &s;ize is &s;o great, that we &s;hould as well think of calling Ptolemy's Caledonia, bending to the ea&s;t, a Cher|&s;one&s;e of Britain. Nor does Tacitus name Scandi|navia, tho he de&s;cribes nations in it, as &s;hall pre|&s;ently be &s;een.</P>
<P>Having thus proceeded to the utmo&s;t north of the we&s;t parts of Germany, or tho&s;e commencing from the Rhine as a boundary, Tacitus pa&s;&s;es to follow the Danube, as he &s;ays, or an ea&s;t cour&s;e, and places the nations regularly one after another as Cluverius well puts them in this tract. After mentioning the utmo&s;t nations this way, Tacitus returns northward, telling that a large chain of mountains divides Suevia, that is a chain running north and &s;outh: beyond which are the <HI>Lygii</HI> con|&s;i&s;ting of many nations, the chief being the <HI>Arii, Helveconae, Manimi, Ely&s;ii, Naharvali.</HI> The Ly|gii are rightly put by Cluverius, in pre&s;ent Sile&s;ia. Above the Lygii were the <HI>Gotthones</HI> rightly put in Pomerellia, at the mouth of the Vi&s;tula or Wei&s;&s;el. <HI>Protinus deinde ab Oceano Rugii et Lemo|vii,</HI> 'next from thence on the ocean the <HI>Rugii,</HI>' rightly put in Rugen; 'and Lemovii,' whom
<PB N="167" REF="637">Cluverius makes the &s;ame with the Heruli, and puts in Pomerania. But the account of Tacitus bears that the Lemovii were we&s;t of the Rugii, for he is coming <HI>deinde</HI> from the Gotthones and Lygii; and Ptolemy expre&s;&s;ly &s;hews that three other na|tions dwelled in pre&s;ent Pomerania, namely the Ruticlii, Sideni, and Pharudini. So that the Lemovii were doubtle&s;s we&s;t of the Rugii or Rugen, as the text of Tacitus bears, who &s;eems to include the three other nations mentioned by Ptolemy in the general name of Gotthones, and thus to extend them over Pomerania as well as Pomerellia. The <HI>Lemovii</HI> were of cour&s;e in pre&s;ent Lubec and Wagerlant.</P>
<P>After this Tacitus proceeds to the Suiones; <HI>Suio|num hinc civitates ip&s;o in oceano,</HI> &amp;c. Modern geographers, following Cluverius, who is by no means accurate, have made the Suiones the pre|&s;ent Swedes; and the northern antiquaries &s;eem to allow this, tho to me nothing is more doubtful<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">The learned Huet, <HI>Commerce des Anc.</HI> rightly &s;aw that the <HI>Suiones</HI> mu&s;t be on the <HI>we&s;t,</HI> from the account of Tacitus; but he errs in placing them in Norway.</NOTE>. For the Sitones, whom Tacitus puts beyond the Suiones, <HI>Suionibus Sitonum gentes continuantur;</HI> and, after de&s;cribing them, &s;ays, <HI>hic Sueviae finis;</HI> and pa&s;&s;es to the Peukini, Venedi, and Fenni, &s;eem to me infallibly the pre&s;ent Swedes: and the name bears more re&s;emblance to <HI>Suitiod,</HI> the old name of Sweden. Whereas Suiones re&s;embles more <HI>Zee-woners,</HI> or <HI>dwellers in the &s;ea,</HI> whence the noble and fertile iland, which forms the be&s;t part of the Dani&s;h dominions, is now called <HI>Zee|land;</HI> the <HI>Su</HI> appearing to be merely a Roman way of expre&s;&s;ing the German &s;ound of Z. in Knytlinga Saga, and other Icelandic books, Zee|land is called Sio-land, a name pre&s;erving affinity with Suiones; as Suitiod, the old name of Swedes and Sweden, in the&s;e works, does with Sitones. Perhaps <HI>Sitones</HI> &s;prung from <HI>Sictuna,</HI> the old name of the chief <HI>civitas</HI> in Sweden, near Birca, as Adam
<PB N="168" REF="638">of Bremen and others te&s;tify. Add to this, that only the mo&s;t &s;outhern part of Scandinavia was ever known to the ancients; and the va&s;t <HI>Wener</HI> Lake, in pre&s;ent We&s;troguland, or as the Swedes affect to call it We&s;trogothia, &s;eems the utmo&s;t bound of their real knowlege; they thinking that beyond was the <HI>Cronium Mare,</HI> or Frozen Ocean; the &s;ea beyond the Suiones, mentioned by Tacitus, which was looked on as the end of the world. I have peru&s;ed, and re-peru&s;ed, with indefatigable and minute attention, all that the ancients have &s;aid of Scandinavia, and am convinced that the nar|rower bounds we confine their knowlege of it to, we &s;hall be the nearer to the truth. The Suiones, after the mo&s;t mature con&s;ideration, appear to me infallibly the people of pre&s;ent Zeeland, and the iles around it, <HI>civitates in oceano,</HI> and part of the Dani&s;h territory on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the &s;ound; now Schonen, Halland, and We&s;trogo|thia. For, can any man believe that Tacitus &s;hould pa&s;s to Scandinavia, and take no notice of the noble and rich iland of Zeeland, and the large and fertile iles around it? &s;hould fly at once, as is dreamed, to pre&s;ent Norway and Sweden, of which he knew as much as he did of Greenland, as every one, the lea&s;t ver&s;t in ancient geography, mu&s;t know? &s;hould join all Scandinavia, a coun|try, when really known, as large as Germany it|&s;elf, to a few &s;mall &s;tates? Was Tacitus utterly ab&s;urd, or are his commentators &s;o?</P>
<P>After the Suiones, Tacitus pa&s;&s;es to the <HI>Ae&s;tii,</HI> who are ra&s;hly enough, from &s;imilarity of names, placed in pre&s;ent E&s;tonia, tho Gle&s;&s;aria, the iland of the Ae&s;tii, is confe&s;&s;ed to be in pre&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia, two hundred miles &s;outh-we&s;t of E&s;tonia; and it is on the coa&s;t of Pru&s;&s;ia alone, that &s;uch quantities of amber are found to this day.

The Fenni were infallibly, from the account of Tacitus, that they were divided from the Peukini, only by woods and hills, inhabited by Venedi, not the people of Finland, as dreamed, but the FINS, a great abo|riginal people, of whom &s;ee Mr. Tooke's Ru&s;&s;ia.

<P>From the Ae&s;tii Tacitus pa&s;&s;es to the <HI>Sitones,</HI> or Swedes of Smaland, on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore: and as the Suiones were unque&s;tionably the people of pre&s;ent Zeeland and &s;urrounding iles, with a &s;mall part of &s;outhern Scandinavia, along the we&s;t &s;hore up to the Wener lake, &s;o the Sitones were only a very &s;mall part of the Swedes, or Suitiod, namely, tho&s;e of pre&s;ent Smaland and Ea&s;ter Gothia. Tacitus, tho he appears to have redd Pliny, from his copying that writer's account of the origin of amber, takes no notice of Scandinavia, but pal|pably implies it to be partly inhabited by the Suiones and Sitones, and is univer&s;ally &s;o under|&s;tood.

For he is &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s from the Lemovii about Lubec, up to Sweden, with <HI>Suio|num hinc civitates</HI> (whereas Zeeland is ju&s;t oppo|&s;ite <HI>hinc</HI> to the Lemovii as above placed); then flies back to the E&s;tii of Pru&s;&s;ia; then flies back <HI>toto coelo</HI> to Norway, of who&s;e exi&s;tence he knew nothing; then clo&s;es a de&s;cription of Norway with <HI>bie Sueviae finis</HI> (his Suevi being but a divi&s;ion of Germans); then flies back again to the Peukini and Venedi and Fenni, nations as remote from Not|way as the &s;outh-ea&s;t is from the north-we&s;t. Take his text as here &s;tated; and all is clear, and accu|rate. He pa&s;&s;es from the Lemovii about Lubec to Zeeland; thence to the Ae&s;ti po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of Gle&s;&s;aria an oppo&s;ite penin&s;ula: then cro&s;&s;es the Baltic to the oppo&s;ite Swedes of Smaland; thence in a right line to the Peukini, Venedi, and Fenni. Add to this, that the remains of the Sitones in Ptolemy, &amp;c. are exactly on the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite to Smaland; and it is certainly more likely that they &s;hould move to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, than into Norway, a country near 300 miles off, without leaving a trace behind.

<P>Ptolemy mentions four Scandias; three &s;mall, perhaps Funen, Zeeland, and Laland: and one large, or Scandinavia, which he de&s;cribes, and Agathadaemon lays down in the map, as ju&s;t of a &s;ize to reach to the Wener lake, as Ptolemy's latitudes and longitudes a&s;certain<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The &s;outhern part of Scandinavia is called <HI>Skani</HI> in the old Icelandic MSS, and it is &s;till <HI>Scania.</HI> Hence in all ap|pearance the Roman <HI>Scandia.</HI></NOTE>. It is above mentioned that, beyond this, the ancients imagined there was only ocean, with a few iles in it, as Eningia a part of Finland, Bergi, Nerigon, all however quite unknown to Ptolemy. In the we&s;t of Ptolemy's Scandinavia are the <HI>Chaedini;</HI> in the ea&s;t the <HI>Phavonae,</HI> and <HI>Phirae&s;i;</HI> on the &s;outh the <HI>Gutae,</HI> and <HI>Dauciones;</HI> in the middle the <HI>Levoni.</HI> The&s;e names mu&s;t all have belonged to tribes &s;outh of the lake Wener.

<P>Tho Grotius &s;eems to quote Baron Herber&s;tein among the earlie&s;t writers, for the name Gothland in Sweden, yet that name is mentioned by Adam of Bremen about 1080: and it is highly probable, that the <HI>Gutae</HI> of Ptolemy were tho&s;e very people by moderns latinized Gothi. The real indigenal name is <HI>Gyllen, Oe&s;tergyllen, We&s;tergyllen.</HI> But writers of the middle ages were fond of approximating old names to modern ones: thus they called the Danes, <HI>Daci;</HI> Norway, <HI>Noricum;</HI> the Swedes <HI>Suevi:</HI> and &s;ome Scandinavian writers of la&s;t century, as Ly&s;cander and Wormius, call Scanen, Scythia. But the antiquity of the very names O&s;trogothia, We&s;trogothia, if you will, is out of all que&s;tion. Certain it is, that the O&s;tro|gothi and Vi&s;ogothi of Roman hi&s;tory came not from that little corner of Sweden, any more than the Franks, Lombards, Heruli, Saxons, went from Scandinavia, as Scandinavian writers dream, <HI>Tantus amor patriae!</HI> But fal&s;e hi&s;tory, in&s;tead of honouring, di&s;graces a country; and it is ever &s;een that the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant countries are the mo&s;t full of fal&s;e honours. The Northern kingdoms need not &s;uch fame.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="642">After this we find little or nothing concerning Scandinavia, till the &s;ixth century, when Jor|nandes was to tell his fables about it, knowing that it's di&s;tance prevented detection. For tho he quotes Ablavius, who is thought by Grotius to be one living under Con&s;tantius II. about the year 340, as mentioned by Ammianus, yet it is only AFTER he de&s;cribes the Goths as &s;ettled in Little Scythia; and we do not even know that Ablavius was not his cotemporary, and as ignorant as him&s;elf. Jornandes, and Procopius, who wrote at the &s;ame time, mention the <HI>Danes;</HI> and <HI>Scritfinni,</HI> or <HI>&s;wift Fins,</HI> which &s;hews that the &s;outh of Finland was now known. As to the other nations placed in Scandinavia, by Jornandes and Procopius, allow|ing their exi&s;tence, they only belonged to the &s;outh parts. Eginhart, who wrote in the Ninth century, is the fir&s;t i find, after the <HI>Sitones</HI> of Tacitus, who mentions the Swedes: and the Normans al&s;o began to be well known in this century, when Harold Harfagre ri&s;ing fir&s;t &s;ole king of Norway, expelled many petry princes, who with their little armies took refuge in the Orkneys, and Iceland: and one of them Ganga Hrolf, or Rollo the Walker, was after &s;ome abode in the Hebudes, to found the dukedom of Normandy.</P>
<P>Could rea&s;on account for the ideas of folly, it were a matter of curio&s;ity to enquire how Jornan|des came to dream of all the nations in Europe proceeding from a di&s;tant and unpopulous country, and to pa&s;s Germany and Getia, or Little Scythia,
<PB N="173" REF="643">countries overflowing with population? It can only be &s;aid that the Goths coming gradually from the north into the empire, it might naturally be imagined that the extreme north, or Scandinavia, was their point of progre&s;&s;ion: tho indeed it may be &s;u&s;pected that a love of the marvellous and fal&s;e, &s;o natural to man, might be the &s;ole &s;pring of a fiction, &s;o oppo&s;ite to common &s;en&s;e, and to all ancient authority.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn what the ancients knew of Scandinavia, let us con&s;ider the progre&s;s of the Scythians or Goths into it. We have already traced two Ba&s;ternic nations, the SITONES and PEUKINI, up to the &s;hores of the Baltic. On the&s;e &s;hores, clo&s;e by them, we find the <HI>Gotthones, Guttones,</HI> or <HI>Gythones,</HI> as called by Tacitus, Pliny, Ptolemy. How this nation came to hold a name &s;o near that of all the Goths, were difficult to &s;ay, were not the name of <HI>Gut</HI> or <HI>Good</HI> given to ground, people, &amp;c. &s;uppo&s;ed the origin of the Scandinavian Gud&s;ke latinized Gothlandia: and our Gotthones probably took their name from the &s;ame fountain, if not from <HI>Gote,</HI> a hor&s;eman, for they bordered on the Ba&s;ternae, who like the Sar|matae were mo&s;tly cavalry, and it is likely the Gothones were la&s;o cavalry, and &s;o called by the other Germans who had little or none. We al&s;o find the Gothini a Gallic nation in the &s;outh of Germany; and, as Tacitus &s;ays their &s;peech was Gallic, they were probably an original Celtic tribe inhabiting a mountainous country, as the map of Cluverius &s;hews, and allowed to dwell on condition of work|ing the mines, and paying heavy tribute, as Tacitus &s;ays they did. Their name Gothini, being pro|bably ironical, <HI>good people.</HI> Herodotus, book IV. places mo&s;t of his Scythians in Germany. The I&s;ter or Danube he calls the large&s;t river of Scy|thia. The Maris or Marus ran into the I&s;ter from the country of the Agathyr&s;i, ch. 37. His Hyperborei are in Germany, for he makes their pre&s;ents to Delos
<PB N="174" REF="644">come down to the Adriatic &s;ea, and thence to Do|dona. In ch. 21. he tells us, that beyond the Ta|nais are the Sarmatae; and his Scythian nations are chiefly in Germany and Poland: ch. 23. he places far to the north &s;ome Scythae who revolted and left the re&s;t. However this be, it is certain from Pliny, that the ancient Greeks extended Scythia even to the Baltic, where amber was alone found: and we learn from Strabo, that it was the general opinion that the Ba&s;ternae (a Scythic di|vi&s;ion) held the parts beyond the Germans, or Scandinavia. The Gythones, or Gothones, Pto|lemy places on the Baltic &s;hore, between the Sideni, or Sidones, and Peukini, two Ba&s;ternic nations; and it is mo&s;t likely that the Gythones were al&s;o Ba&s;ternae. The Sidones, or Sitones, we find in the &s;outh of Sweden on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t; and the Gythones, or Guttones, are &s;urely the Gutae, of the &s;outh of Scandinavia, as put by Ptolemy, who had pa&s;&s;ed over to the ground for|merly held by the Sitones on their moving north|ea&s;t: for <HI>on,</HI> as Grotius ob&s;erves, is merely the old German plural, which is &s;ometimes given, &s;ometimes omitted; thus Gutae, Gutones; Bur|gundi, Burgundiones; Lugii, Lugiones, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is believed, that no one, the lea&s;t ver&s;ed in the &s;ubject, will object that the voyage from pre|&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia to Scandinavia, was too far, for a people in the rude&s;t &s;tate of &s;ociety. Some mo|dern writers deny early population by &s;ea; as Ta|citus and other ancients reject progre&s;s by land. As the later forgot that men have feet, &s;o the former forget that they have hands. Sea, far from checking intercour&s;e, makes it ea&s;ier even to barbarians. Wherever men are found, canoes are found; even when huts, nay cloths are want|ing. The Greenlanders and Fins navigate hun|dreds of miles: and no nation, however &s;avage, has been di&s;covered in any maritime corner of the
<PB N="175" REF="645">globe, that was a &s;tranger to navigation. In the South Seas Captain Cook found &s;mall iles 400, 500, 600 miles from each other, peopled by the &s;ame race of men, &s;peaking the &s;ame tongue.</P>
<P>We do not find any traces in Ptolemy, or el&s;e|where, of any nations pa&s;&s;ing from the we&s;t of Germany into Scandinavia, except perhaps the <HI>Levoni</HI> of Ptolemy's Scandinavia be the <HI>Lemovii</HI> of Tacitus in Lubec and Wagerland, where the pa&s;&s;age to Scandinavia is very ea&s;y. But from the ea&s;t, to which the Scythic progre&s;s was nearer and &s;peedier, we find the Gutae and Sitones had pa&s;&s;ed: and Strabo expre&s;&s;es it the general opinion that the Ba&s;ternae held Scandinavia. The&s;e circum|&s;tances &s;eem to evince, as clearly as the ca&s;e will bear, that Scandinavia was peopled by the Ba&s;ternic nations on the ea&s;t of Germany: and as their pro|gre&s;s was as near from Little Scythia, the <HI>punctum &s;aliens,</HI> to the extremity of Scandinavia, as was that of their brethren to the extremity of Germany, &s;o there is every rea&s;on to conclude that Scandina|via was peopled with Scythians as &s;oon as Germany. The Northern Fins, including Laplanders, &s;eem to have been infallibly aborigines of their country; for they are &s;o weak, &s;o peaceable, and their &s;oil &s;o wretched, that they could have vanqui&s;hed no nation, and no nation could envy them their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions <HI>in climes beyond the &s;olar road.</HI></P>
<P>As we thus find that the Ba&s;ternae, or tho&s;e Ger|mans who lived ea&s;t of the Vi&s;tula, were the Scythic divi&s;ion that peopled Scandinavia, it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Peukini, who&s;e name is put by Tacitus as &s;ynonymous with Ba&s;ternae, and whom we have traced up to the very &s;hore oppo&s;ite to Scandinavia, &s;hould have &s;ent no colonies into it. On the contrary we have every rea&s;on to believe that they were the fir&s;t Scythians who pa&s;&s;ed into it; and moving on in con&s;tant progre&s;s, left room for their brethren the Sitones to follow; for we find the &s;teps of the Peukini in Ptolemy from Peuk&eacute; to the Tyras, from thence to the Peukinian
<PB N="176" REF="646">Mountains in Pru&s;&s;ia<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Paulus Diaconus I, 11, 12. mentions that when the Lom|bards came to <HI>Mauringa,</HI> they encountered the <HI>AE Pitti</HI> or No|ble Pitti for &s;o <HI>As</HI> implies in Gothic.</NOTE>, in a direct line; while the Sitones moved round by the we&s;tward, for in Ptolemy we find remains of them above the Quadi in the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Germany; and others, &s;till further north-we&s;t, on the Baltic &s;hore. The Peukini, on the contrary, never cro&s;&s;ed the Vi&s;|tula, but proceeded &s;trait on to the Baltic &s;hore.

The&s;e rea&s;ons appear to me &s;o clear and cogent, as fully to confirm the opinion of the ancients, as related by Strabo, that the Ba&s;ternic Germans peopled Scandinavia; and al&s;o to infer, from every ground of cool probability, that the <HI>Peukini</HI> were the very fir&s;t Ba&s;ternae who pa&s;&s;ed over, and proceeded north-we&s;t till they emerged under the name of <HI>Picti,</HI> the <HI>Pehtar,</HI> or <HI>Peohtar,</HI> or <HI>Pihtar,</HI> of the Saxon Chronicle, <HI>Pehiti</HI> of Witichind, and <HI>Pehts</HI> of ancient Scoti&s;h poets, and modern natives of Scotland, and the north of England.</P>

In my laborious re&s;earch into early Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory, i was &s;hocked to find that, in&s;tead of a foundation, i had not even good ground for a foundation, owing to the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s with which the origin of nations has been treated. The toil it has co&s;t me to drain my ground of much watry fal&s;ehood, has been equal to that of building my fabric, as the reader may judge. I can &s;afely &s;ay the truth has been my &s;ole object; for my labour has been too great to wa&s;te any part of it in a bauble of an hypo|the&s;is, which falls at the fir&s;t breath, while truth remains for ever. To proceed to a hint on the Piks, it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Northern hi&s;torians could be ignorant of a nation once &s;o celebrated, and who proceeded from Norway. Accordingly we find the va&s;t hi&s;tory of Norway by Torfaeus, compiled from Icelandic Sagas, &amp;c. quite full of them; but under a variation in the initial letter, the cau&s;e of which mu&s;t be explained.</P>
<P>Grammarians ob&s;erve certain letters which are called <HI>labial</HI> becau&s;e pronounced by the lips: they are <HI>b, f, m, p, v;</HI> of the&s;e the <HI>b, f, p, v,</HI> put at the beginning of words, are pronounced almo&s;t with the &s;ame motion of the lips, and are thus often interchanged. In Roman in&s;crip|tions we find <HI>Bita</HI> for <HI>Vita;</HI> in Greek authors <HI>Biturius</HI> for <HI>Viturius,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. In Spani&s;h V is pronounced B. The F, or Greek digamma, was pronounced V, as all know. But the inter|change
<PB N="178" REF="648">change of <HI>P,</HI> and <HI>V,</HI> which alone concerns my pre&s;ent inve&s;tigation, &s;eems peculiar to the Germans, and Northern nations of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, for i cannot trace it in Italian, Spani&s;h, or French. Thus the Germans &s;ay <HI>Vater</HI> for the Latin <HI>Pater; Picker</HI> is Icelandic for a &s;hipbuilder, from <HI>Vig, a &s;hip;</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. The Saxons found the &s;ound of P and V &s;o &s;imilar, that they actually adopted the Roman letter P to ex|pre&s;s V, and W, a modification of V. Thus on coins of William I. and II. of England PILEM is WILEM; and the &s;ame occurs in the earlie&s;t Saxon coins and MSS, and in the printed Saxon at this day, as all know. Torfaeus ob&s;erves, in his <HI>Series Regum Daniae,</HI> that the <HI>Vitta</HI> of the Saxon genealo|gi&s;ts is the <HI>Pitta</HI> of the Icelandic. I need not produce more in&s;tances, but refer the reader, if he wi&s;hes for more, to the <HI>Glo&s;&s;arium Germanicum</HI> of Wachter; the <HI>Glo&s;&s;arium Suio-Gothicum</HI> (&s;hould be <HI>Suito-Gothicum</HI>) of Ihre; and the <HI>Lexicon I&s;landicum</HI> of Andreas. The phy&s;ical rea&s;on of the Northern nations u&s;ing V for P, or pronouncing P as V, may be, that the cold contracts their organs, for V is only a le&s;s open pronounciation of P.</P>
<P>But in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance there is no occa|&s;ion to in&s;i&s;t on labial changes, but barely to men|tion that in the Icelandic, or Old Scandinavian language, there is in fact no &s;uch letter as P; and in words of foreign extract the P is always pro|nounced V, and is from that cau&s;e generally &s;o written.

<P>It may be proper, before concluding, briefly to con&s;ider the received opinions concerning the Scan|dinavian origins. Saxo Grammaticus has founded the Dani&s;h monarchy in the per&s;on of a king Dan, more than a thou&s;and years before Chri&s;t. Tor|faeus, from Icelandic Sagas, has &s;hewn, that Saxo's
<PB N="180" REF="650">&s;y&s;tem, drawn from old &s;ongs, is fal&s;e; and that Skiold, &s;on of Odin, was the fir&s;t king of Denmark, a little before our aera. Mallet has, in his hi&s;tory of Denmark, followed the plan of Torfaeus; and as it is much more rational than Saxo's, it promi&s;es to &s;tand as to &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kings; Torfaeus founding on the &s;ole authorities which remain; and it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that any future hi&s;torian &s;hould be &s;o frantic as to con|tend again&s;t his authorities, or that the public &s;hould approve &s;uch delu&s;ion. In Sweden, the tales of Joannes Magnus, the forger, have, for a century, been in utter contempt; and the hi&s;tory re&s;ts upon an author of wonderful merit and judg|ment for his age, Snorro Sturle&s;on, who wrote in the thirteenth century, and who&s;e hi&s;tory extends to two folio volumes, and al&s;o relates to Denmark and Norway. It is in the Icelandic tongue; but a Latin tran&s;lation is given by Pering&s;kiold. He makes Odin cotemporary with Pompey, from whom he flies into the north; and &s;ubduing Scandinavia, keeps Sweden for him&s;elf, and com|mences the line of kings. The Norwegian hi&s;tory re&s;ts on the diligence of Torfaeus, who from Ice|landic chronicles, genealogies, &amp;c. concludes Odin to have come to Scandinavia in the time of Darius Hy&s;ta&s;pis, or about 520 years before Chri&s;t. Some Northern antiquaries al&s;o finding in the Edda that Odin was put as the &s;upreme deity, and that a total uncertainty about his age prevailed in the old accounts, have imagined to them&s;elves another Odin, who lived about 1000 years before our aera; a mere arbitrary date, and which the formers of this &s;y&s;tem had better have put 500 years before Chri&s;t, as Torfaeus the mo&s;t diligent of Northern antiquaries has done. Mallet, who has taken matters as he found them, &s;uppo&s;es two Odins; and looks on the la&s;t, who flouri&s;hed in Pompey's time, as an A&s;iatic Magician; nay he tells us &s;ome believe three Odins! Torfaeus, we have &s;een, in
<PB N="181" REF="651">his Norwegian hi&s;tory, infers him to have lived 500 years before Chri&s;t, whom in his <HI>Series Regum Daniae</HI> he had thought lived only 50!</P>
<Q>O caecas hominum mentes! O pectora caeca!</Q>
<P>Here is the &s;ecret: ODIN NEVER EXISTED. The whole affair is an allegory. Torfaeus, &s;o pro|foundly ver&s;ed in the Icelandic monuments, tells us they abound in allegory, in&s;omuch that it is often impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h truth from fal&s;ehood in them. Strange that he did not &s;ee that they all begin with allegorv! Not one of the&s;e Icelandic pieces, nor any monument whatever of Scandina|vian hi&s;tory, is older than the Eleventh century. What dependence then as to events happening be|fore Chri&s;t? Their chronology down to Harold Harfagre, or the end of the ninth century, is al&s;o quite confu&s;ed, in&s;omuch that you will find one man cotemporary to three or four centuries.</P>
<P>The Later Edda, which was al&s;o compiled by Snorro in the thirteenth century, fully confirms the idea that Odin was never in life, but was merely the God of War. In this Edda Thor is the &s;on of Odin. Mallet well ob&s;erves that, thro this whole Edda, Odin the hero, who led the Goths from A&s;ia, is confounded with Odin the God of War, or &s;upreme god of the Norwegians. True: yet is there no confu&s;ion. There was but one Odin, the god. The hero is a non-exi&s;tence. The whole progre&s;s of the Goths from A&s;ia under Odin is &s;o palpable and direct an allegory, that he mu&s;t have little penetration indeed who cannot pierce it. It was the God of War who conducted the Goths; literally, they fought their way again&s;t the Celts and Fins. But it may be &s;aid, how then came Snorro (for on him the whole re&s;ts) to make Odin cotemporary with Pompey? Be it ob&s;erved on this, that Snorro lived at a late period, the end of the Thirteenth century, and that not an iota about Pompey could occur, till Chri&s;tianity introduced
<PB N="182" REF="652">Latin Learning in the 11th age. The fact is merely this. Snorro found even from his &s;trange genealogy, that the earlie&s;t kings of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, of whom tradition pre&s;erved the names, could not be dated further back than about 50 years before Chri&s;t. The&s;e kings, as u&s;ual with even Greek and Roman genealogi&s;ts, when the name of their fathers was unknown to tradition, were called &s;ons of &s;ome God; and in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e Odin the <HI>Alfader,</HI> and the Mars, was the common &s;ire. Snorro, who, as appears from his work, was con&s;iderably tinctured with Latin learning, never reflected that Odin could be only an allegorical father; but &s;imply believes him a real human father; and finding his epoch according to his fooli&s;h genealogy of Kings cor|re&s;pond, in this view, with that of Pompey, thinks it a proper place to di&s;play his Latin, by connecting his hi&s;tory with the Roman. His work is divided into various Sagas, or hi&s;toric romances; and as the Icelanders had Sagas on Alexander the Great, on Arthur, on Troy, &amp;c. it is likely they had one on Pompey; in which, as all chronology was confounded in the&s;e romances, Odin was brought in as fighting with him. Snorro probably had this &s;aga before him, and &s;o gives the tale. But to &s;hew how very little Snorro can be relied on, we have only to reflect that, in the preface to the Edda, he makes Thor the founder of Troy, and Odin his de&s;cendant in the 17th generation; that is, allowing 30 years as u&s;ual for a generation, Odin lived 510 years after <HI>Thor,</HI> whom he makes <HI>Tros,</HI> from mere &s;imilarity of names. Now Tros lived, as chronologers mark, 1360 years before Chri&s;t; of cour&s;e Odin lived 850 years before Chri&s;t, and yet was cotemporary to Pompey! No wonder that three Odins were nece&s;&s;ary! In truth chronology, as might be ex|pected, is utterly confounded in tho&s;e romances called Sagas, in&s;omuch that Torfaeus once placed
<PB N="183" REF="653">King Hrolf Krak 500 years before Chri&s;t, and was afterward forced to put him 500 years after Chri&s;t. The &s;tory of Odin flying from Pompey is a mere dream of &s;ome &s;illy Saga; and he who builds on it mu&s;t be weaker than a child. Such an event, as the migration of a whole nation from the Euxine to the Baltic, could never e&s;cape the Greeks, who had numerous colonies on the Euxine, and who traded to the Baltic for amber. It is however remarkable that all Scandinavian Sagas mention Odin with his Scythians coming to Scandinavia, but not one hints that a &s;ingle colony went from it to Scvthia; which is another argu|ment again&s;t the Goths proceeding from Scandi|navia.</P>
<P>If the Northern antiquaries will therefore open their eyes, and &s;ee at la&s;t that all concerning Odin is a mere mythologic allegory, they will do well. There was but one Odin, the God of War, who was cotemporary in all ages. The kings of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, nay the whole Anglo-Saxon kings, owned him as fir&s;t father. That is, they were entitled &s;olely to martial prowe&s;s for their thrones. As for the genealogy of Odin him&s;elf, in which we find him de&s;cended from a line of ance&s;tors, as <HI>Geta</HI> or the father of the Getae, and <HI>Pitta</HI> or the father of the Piks, &amp;c. it is al&s;o allegorical, as much as the Theogonia of He&s;iod, and the genealogies of Greek gods and heroes. Mere poetry all; and not hi&s;tory. Odin's progre&s;s, as marked from the Northern hi&s;tories, by Mallet, in his fourth chapter of the Introduction was round by Germany, the Cimbric Cher&s;one&s;e, and Denmark, into Sweden. How could Mallet be &s;o much a&s;leep, as to dream that this event which, according to him, happened in Cae&s;ar's time, could be unknown to Cae&s;ar? That Odin &s;hould pierce thro all the hundred martial nations of Ger|many, and not leave a trace behind? Should vanqui&s;h the Suevi, to whom, as their neighbours
<PB N="184" REF="654">&s;aid, the Gods were not equal? One is &s;ick of &s;uch folly; and to confute it is to deba&s;e the hu|man mind. The whole is unchronologic allegory. The Goths by war &s;ubdued and peopled Scandina|via, an event that happened at lea&s;t 500 years be|fore Chri&s;t; and was accompli&s;hed by different nations, under different leaders, but all under the guidance of Odin the god of war. Varro marks three divi&s;ions of antiquity, the <HI>dark,</HI> the <HI>mythologic,</HI> the <HI>hi&s;toric.</HI> The Northern antiquaries to this day; when &s;uch great writers as Schoening, Suhm the illu&s;trious patron of Dani&s;h literature, Lagerbring the mo&s;t acute Swedi&s;h hi&s;torian, rank among them; &s;till confound the <HI>mythologic</HI> with the <HI>hi&s;toric</HI> period. Odin is wholly a mythologic per&s;onage; and has nothing to do with hi&s;tory, which only faintly dawns at the reigns of his re|puted &s;ons, as the Roman does with Romulus &s;on of Mars. The tales about him, and his A&s;ae, are all poetical allegories; and have no more to do with hi&s;tory than Greek mythology. If he ever exi&s;ted, it was in the fir&s;t Scythian empire, 3000 years before Chri&s;t. Romulus was the &s;on of Mars, as the Northern kings of Odin: but no writer has been &s;o fooli&s;h as to infer that Mars was the human father of Romulus, and reigned in Latium ju&s;t before him. The great good &s;en&s;e of the Scandinavian antiquaries has already led them to laugh at Jornandes: but one or two &s;till dream of a migration of Goths to Scandinavia under one Odin, about 1000 years before Chri&s;t; a &s;econd from it to Getia, about 300 years before Chri&s;t; and a return under another Odin 70 years before Chri&s;t. So hard it is to eradicate prejudice!</P>
<P>A philo&s;ophic di&s;&s;ertation on Scandinavian Chronology is wanted; but philo&s;ophy has not yet reached Scandinavia; and it's be&s;t writers are full of their dome&s;tic tales, but &s;trangers to Greek and Roman learning, and to the general hi&s;tory of ancient Europe. Their hi&s;tories bear only 24 kings,
<PB N="185" REF="655">(one more or le&s;s,) from 70 years before Chri&s;t to Ragnar Lodbrog, who flouri&s;hed, as appears from Old Engli&s;h writers and other certain ac|counts, in 830. But in the &s;eries of Iri&s;h, Piki&s;h, and Heptarchic kings of England, the kings reign but eleven years each at a medium; and Sir I&s;aac Newton has &s;hewn that even in civilized kingdoms they reign but eighteen. Scandinavia was certainly more ferocious than mo&s;t other countries, and it's kings mu&s;t have reigned a &s;horter, and not a longer, time than the kings in England, Scotland, and Ireland: accordingly mo&s;t of the early Swedi&s;h and Dani&s;h kings die violent deaths. Not more than eleven years can be allowed to each reign: and 264 years reckoned back from 830 give the year of Chri&s;t 566, for the commencement of the &s;eries; and period of the mock Odin. The gene|rations can never be computed by reigns of kings. All hi&s;tory refu&s;es this. Who can believe that the &s;ons regularly &s;ucceeded their fathers, and formed generations by reigns? Snorro, &amp;c. are in this re&s;pect more fabulous than Saxo. The generations are fal&s;e; tho the names may be genuine. But even fable ought to bear veri&s;imilitude; and from the year 500 to 900 &s;hould be placed the Fabulous part of Dani&s;h, Swedi&s;h, Norwegian hi&s;tory. All before is dark, and lo&s;t even to fable. The total &s;ilence of their writers concerning the progre&s;s of the Jutes and Angles to England confirms this date, as well as the mo&s;t certain rules of chronology.</P>

<P>ANCIENT Chronology has been ruined by at|tempting to force it to Scripture, which is &s;urely no canon of chronology; for the Septuagint, tran&s;lated from MSS. far more ancient than any we have, differs from the pre&s;ent. Hebrew no le&s;s than 576 years before Noah, and 880 from Noah to Abraham. The Greek Church, certainly as well in&s;tructed as the Roman, dates the creation 5508 years before Chri&s;t. Epiphanius, Augu&s;tin, and other fathers, follow the Hebrew of their time, which agrees with the Septuagint. But Ancient Chronology ought only to be e&s;timated from ancient authors; and kept quite apart from &s;criptural chronology. The date of the creation, &amp;c. can never be decided, either from &s;cripture or otherwi&s;e; and &s;uch &s;peculations are futile. In other points the authority of the learned U&s;her, now univer&s;ally allowed the be&s;t chronologer, is followed.</P>
<P>In adju&s;ting ancient chronology, it mu&s;t ever be re|membered that in tradition, as in common memory, GREAT EVENTS, tho very remote, are, from the deep im|pre&s;&s;ion they make, apt to be blended with &s;mall recent incidents. Thus the fir&s;t Scythic Empire, the victories of Se&s;o&s;tris, &amp;c. were great events pre&s;erved in the memory of many generations; but in the hi&s;toric page the&s;e great ancient events appear crouded, and imme|diately precede le&s;&s;er incidents, which happened but eight centuries, or &s;o, before our aera. So in old age any affecting incident of childhood appears but of ye&s;|terday; while all the intermediate pa&s;&s;ages of youth, and maturity, have peri&s;hed. Tradition, like memory, pre&s;erves Great matters, and Late matters, in the &s;ame vivid manner; the former becau&s;e they have made deep impre&s;&s;ion; the later becau&s;e the impre&s;&s;ion is recent.</P>

<P N="250">250. The Getae or Parental Goths pa&s;s the Tyras or Nei&s;ter into the province of Dacia, and ravaging it march on &s;outh over the Danube into Thrace. The&s;e Goths did not come originally from Scandinavia, as mo&s;t fooli&s;hly inferred from Jornandes, who &s;ays no &s;uch thing, but that the ancient Scythians or Goths came from Scandinavia, and afterward conquered A&s;ia and Vexores king of Egypt, events that happened about 3660 years before Chri&s;t. This ridiculous and ab&s;urd tale of Jornandes, tho narrated with &s;uch palpable hues of &s;able as cannot impo&s;e on a child, and tho utterly contradicted by the con&s;ent of all the ancients, as
<PB N="189" REF="659">&s;hewn above in the &s;econd chapter of this e&s;&s;ay, has yet mi&s;led all the greate&s;t authors of Europe to this hour! The fact is, that the&s;e Goths who now poured into Da|cia were the Getae, a people whom Darius found in the very country whence they now i&s;&s;ued 570 years before Chri&s;t, as Herodotus &s;hews. They were, as above fully explained, the &s;ame with the Scythae, as Jornandes al&s;o knew: and that the Scythae came from the &s;outhern parts of A&s;ia, the reader has &s;een by the con&s;ent of all antiquity. Soon after we find the Getae, or Goths, laterly &s;o called, divided into <HI>O&s;trogoths,</HI> or <HI>Ea&s;tern-Getoe,</HI> and <HI>Ve&s;igoths,</HI> or <HI>We&s;tern-Getoe.</HI> The royalty of the O&s;trogoths was, as Jornandes &s;hews, ch. 5. in the family of the <HI>Amal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> and the neighbouring Scythic na|tions of the <HI>Alani,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. were generally &s;ubject to the O&s;trogoths.

The progre&s;s of the&s;e two va&s;t nations of O&s;trogoths and Ve&s;igoths will be &s;hewn in the &s;equel. The&s;e Goths, who poured into Dacia A.

<P>About this time al&s;o the Piks, a German-Gothic people of Scandinavia, who had &s;ettled in pre&s;ent Scot|land about three centuries before Chri&s;t, ravage the north of Britain; as indeed Eumenius the panegyri&s;t &s;ays they had been accu&s;tomed to do before the time of Julius Cae&s;ar. Theodo&s;ius, the general of Valenti|nian, found the Piks, and their confederates the Scots, advanced even to London; whence he repelled them: and driving the Piks to their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions beyond the Clyde and Forth, gained the province which he called Valentia.</P>

<P>About 375 the HUNS bur&s;t at once from Tartary upon the dominions of the Alani and O&s;trogoths. As the appearance of this new people forms the greate&s;t phaenomenon in the hi&s;tory of Europe, it will be pro|per to dwell a little on it. M. de Guignes has, from his knowlege of the Chine&s;e tongue, obliged the world with a complete hi&s;tory of the Huns, in four large volumes: tho unhappily full of errors, becau&s;e M. de G. was not &s;killed in Greek and Roman hi&s;tory and geography. The Huns are the Hiong-nou of the Chine&s;e, and their own Tartars: and originated from the north of China. Their wars with the Chine&s;e can be traced back to 200 years before our aera. About 87 years before Chri&s;t, the Chine&s;e obtained a prodigious victory over them. The va&s;t Hunnic nations after this fell into civil wars. In proce&s;s of time the numerous hordes that were vanqui&s;hed moved we&s;t in two divi&s;ions, one divi&s;ion &s;ettled on the confines of Per&s;ia, the other pa&s;&s;ed north we&s;t over the va&s;t river Volga, and poured into Europe in amazing numbers, which no valour could with&s;tand. They fir&s;t encountered the Alani, whom they overpowered, but admitted as allies. They,
<PB N="192" REF="662">and the other Gothic nations, who even to the Cale|donian woods of the Piks were of large limbs, ele|gant and blooming features, and light hair, were a&s;ton|i&s;hed at the very forms of the&s;e new invaders, di|&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;quat limbs, flat no&s;es, broad faces, and &s;mall black eyes, dark hair, with little or no beard, as are indeed the pre&s;ent Tartars. The O&s;trogoths yielded to the Hunnic &s;warms, and were admitted allies on con|dition of fighting in their armies.</P>
<P N="376">376. The Huns now commanded by Balamir (as they were afterward by three others before the famous Attila) next entered the Ve&s;igothic territory. The Ve&s;igoths &s;eeing all re&s;i&s;tance would be vain, again&s;t &s;uch myriads, were forced to implore the protection of the emperor Valens, who, with more genero&s;ity than policy, allowed them &s;ettlements &s;outh of the Danube. Upon which near a million of the Ve&s;igoths, including wives and children, pa&s;&s;ed into the Roman territory of Mae&s;ia. A remnant of the O&s;trogoths al&s;o followed. The Goths being denied provi&s;ions revolt.</P>
<P N="377">377. The Goths penetrate into Thrace.</P>
<P N="378">378. On the 9th of Augu&s;t was fought the famous battle of Hadrianople, in which Valens was defeated and &s;lain by the Goths. Ammianus &s;ays it was another Cannae. But the Goths, falling into inte&s;tine divi&s;ions, were in the cour&s;e of a dozen years repelled to Panno|nia, and a colony of the Ve&s;igoths was &s;ettled in Thrace, while a few O&s;trogoths were placed in Lydia and Phrygia. An army of 40,000 Goths was retained for defence of the empire, and are remarkable in the Byzantine writers by the name of <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>foederati.</HI></P>
<P>During the re&s;t of the reign of Balamir, and tho&s;e of his three &s;ucce&s;&s;ors Octar, Roas, and Bleda, the Huns re&s;ted &s;atisfied with the territory they had gained, which extended to pre&s;ent Hungary: and Attila did not reign till 430, or about 50 years after this.

<P N="415">415.

Ataulphus, king of the Ve&s;igoths, now led his forces again&s;t them. The Ve&s;i|goths in three years conquer the invaders; and re&s;tore Spain to the Romans.

But no German, or Scandinavian, author, or antiquary, &s;hews a &s;ingle trace of this, and we know it to be fal&s;e from the names of the nations who followed Attila's &s;tandard. On the ea&s;t the O&s;trogoths obeyed him; and the Gepidae, who&s;e king Ardaric was his faithfull coun&s;ellor; and the Heruli. On the we&s;t, the Rugii and Thuringi are the only nations we find under his banner at Chalons, where his whole force was a&s;&s;embled; and they both moved &s;outh long before, and bordered on Bohemia and Hungary. Attila's domains were va&s;t; but he turned with &s;corn from the barren north, while the &s;outh afforded every temptation; and we read of none of his conque&s;ts to the north. The cool hi&s;torian will therefore reject the hyperboles of fancy and fear; and contract Attila's power in Germany to very narrow bounds. The palace and royal village of Attila, de&s;cribed by Pri&s;cus and Jornandes, &s;tood between the Danube and the Tey&s;s, in the plains of upper Hungary; and he cho&s;e that &s;pot that he might over-run the Romans, and command the &s;outh we&s;t provinces of the empire.</P>
<P>At this time Theodoric reigned over the Ve&s;igoths in Gaul; and Clodion, the fir&s;t king in real hi&s;tory, over the Franks; of Pharamond no authentic trace can be found.</P>
<P N="449">449. The Vitae or Jutes arrive in Britain. Mr. Gib|bon is certainly right that they were not invited, as dreamed, but were northern rovers, allowed to &s;ettle in Kent, on condition of lending a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Piks and Scots. The weak manner in which the an|cient hi&s;tory of England has been treated, while by the labours of many learned men that of France and Ger|many is clear as day, has left confu&s;ion every where. The acqui&s;itions of the Jutes, Saxons, Angli, are all huddled together by our &s;uperficial dablers! The <HI>Jutes</HI> &s;eized a corner of Kent in 449: they encrea&s;ed, and founded the kingdom of Kent about 460. In 477 the fir&s;t <HI>Saxons</HI> arrived, and founded the kingdom of South
<PB N="195" REF="665">Saxons. In 495 the We&s;t Saxons arrived. The Ea&s;t Saxons in 527. Hitherto there were no Angli in Bri|tain. The fir&s;t <HI>Angli</HI> who arrived, came under Ida to Bornicia in 547. The Ea&s;t Angles do not appear till 575. Mercia, which Beda &s;ays was an Anglic kingdom, but &s;eems to me a Fri&s;ian, as we know that the Fri&s;i were of the nations who &s;eized Britain tho omitted by Beda, who was an Anglus, and gives that name mo&s;t improperly; Mercia was founded in 585. Let me al&s;o ob&s;erve on this great event, that the ideas received into Engli&s;h hi&s;tory concerning it are, in &s;ome other re&s;pects, mi&s;taken. The Belgic Britons, as Germans, infallibly u&s;ed the &s;ame tongue with their new allies. The Wel&s;h were, even in the time of Julius, confined to Wales and the north: they are his <HI>indigenes.</HI> The Wel&s;h u&s;urp all the Belgic kings, with whom they have no more to do than with the Engli&s;h. From Cunobe|linus to Vortiger not a prince can be given to the Welch. The Belgic Britons no doubt amounted to three or four millions; all of whom were incorporated with their allies, who by all accounts were not numer|ous, tho warlike. The Belgae were the Villani and &s;laves of the conquerors; and exceeding them in number, their &s;peech mu&s;t have prevailed as happened in Spain, Italy, and Gaul, where the <HI>lingua ru&s;tica Romana</HI> ob|tained. Our old language &s;hould be called Anglo-Belgic, not Anglo-Saxon. They who look on the Welch as the only &s;peech of the ancient Britons are widely mi&s;taken: they were called Britons, as being the <HI>indigenes;</HI> while the Belgic name was lo&s;t in the heptar|chic &s;tates. The Welch and Iri&s;h tongues pre&s;erve that &s;oul of language the grammar: but are &s;o mixt with Gothic, or German and Latin, that Ihre, not knowing the va&s;t difference of the grammar, pronounces what we call Celtic a dialect of the Gothic. In Gothic we have a monument of the fourth century, the go&s;pels of Ulphila, a book in which the meaning of every word is &s;acred and marked. In Celtic we have no remain older than the eleventh century; and the interpretation is dubious. The Belgae commanded both in Britain, and Ireland; and, being a later and far &s;uperior people, im|parted innumerable words to the Celtic. They there|fore who derive any Engli&s;h words from Celtic only &s;hew a ri&s;ible ignorance: for the truth is, that the Celtic are derived from the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P N="451"><PB N="196" REF="666">451. Attila invades Gaul, and be&s;ieges Orleans. The grand battle of Chalons, the <HI>campi Catalaunici,</HI> is fought.

<PB N="200" REF="672">pur&s;ue the &s;hore of the Northern Ocean to the left, till we come to Gades. Many ilands without names are &s;aid to be in that tract. Of which one oppo&s;ite to Scy|thia called Raunonia, is di&s;tant a day's cour&s;e, on which, in &s;pring, amber is ca&s;t up by the waves, as Timaeus tells. The other &s;hores are marked by uncer|tain fame. The Northern ocean Hecataeus calls Amal|chium, from the river Paropami&s;us, where it wa&s;hes Scythia: which name in the language of that people implies Congealed or Frozen. Philemon &s;ays it is called Morimaru&s;a, by the Cimbri, &s;ignifying the Dead Sea, till it reaches the promontory Rubeas, and beyond that it is called Cronium. Xenophon of Lamp&s;acus re|lates that, three days &s;ail from the coa&s;t of the Scythians, there is an iland of immen&s;e &s;ize, called Baltia. Pytheas terms the &s;ame iland Ba&s;ilia. The Oonae are al&s;o &s;poken of, in which the natives live on eggs of birds, and on oats. Others in which are men born with hor&s;es feet, and thence named Hippopodes. Others of the Fane&s;ii, who&s;e otherwi&s;e naked bodies are covered with their va&s;t ears.</P>
<P>Thence clearer accounts begin with the nation of Ingaevones, the fir&s;t on that &s;ide of Germany. There Sevo, an immen&s;e range of mountains, nor le&s;s than the Riphaean, forms a great bay even to the Cimbric Promontory, which bay is termed Codanus and is full of ilands. Of which the mo&s;t famous is Scandinavia of undi&s;covered greatne&s;s; the Hilleviones in five hun|dred di&s;tricts inhabiting the only part known, who call it another world. Nor is Eningia le&s;s in opinion. Some relate that tho&s;e tracts even to the river Vi&s;tula are inhabited by the Sarmatae, Venedi, Sciri, and Hirri: and that the bay is called Cylipenum, and an ile in it's mouth Latris. Then another bay, called Lagnus, adjacent to the Cimbri. The Cimbric Promontory running far into the &s;ea, forms a penin&s;ula, called Cartris. Thence are Twenty-three iles, known to the Roman arms. The noble&s;t of them are Burchana, called Fabaria by our people, from a &s;pontaneous fruit in the &s;hape of a bean. Al&s;o Gle&s;&s;aria, &s;o called by our &s;oldiers, from it's amber, but by the barbarians Au&s;tra|nia; and likewi&s;e Actania.</P>
<P>Along this whole &s;ea, even to the river Scaldis the German nations dwell, in a &s;pace not explicable, the di&s;cordance of accounts being &s;o immoderate. The
<PB N="201" REF="673">Greeks, and &s;ome of us, have related the borders of Germany to be of Twenty-five Hundred miles. Agrippa, including Rhaetia and Noricum, puts it's length at 696 miles, it's breadth at 248, the breadth of Rhaetia almo&s;t alone, (&s;ubdued about the time of Agrippa's death) being greater than that of Germany <HI>[on the South].</HI> For Germany was not known many years after, nor is yet thoroughly &s;o. If conjecture may be allowed, there will not be much wanting of its circum|ference in the opinion of the Greeks, and of it's length as given by Agrippa.</P>
<P>There are Five divi&s;ions of Germans. The Vandili, of whom a part are the Burgundiones, Varini, Cari|ni, Guttones. Another Divi&s;ion is the Ingaevones, of whom are the Cimbri, Teutoni, and nations of Chauci. Neare&s;t the Rhine are the I&s;taevones, of whom the in|land Cimbri form a part. The Hermiones of whom are the Suevi, Hermunduri, Chatti, Cheru&s;ci. The Fi&s;th Part is formed by the Peukini Ba&s;ternae, bordering on the Daci abovementioned. Famous rivers flowing into the ocean are the Guttalus, the Vi&s;tillus or Vi&s;tula, the Albis, Vi&s;urgis, Ami&s;ius, Rhenus, Mo&s;a. In the inner parts the Hercynian mountains extend, inferior to none in fame.</P>

<P><HI>In de&s;cribing A&s;ia, after Cappadocia, Armenia, Albania, Iberia, and iles in Pontus, he proceeds to the Nations on the Scythic Ocean.</HI></P>
<P>Now, having de&s;cribed the inner parts of A&s;ia, my mind pa&s;&s;es the Riphaean mountains, and traces the &s;hore of the Ocean on the right hand. Which wa&s;hing A&s;ia on three points of heaven, is called Scythic on the north; Eoan on the ea&s;t; Indian on the &s;outh; and is variou&s;ly divided into many le&s;&s;er names from it's bays, and the inhabitants of it's &s;hores. But a great portion of A&s;ia expo&s;ed to the north, by the injury of a rigid &s;tar, has va&s;t &s;olitudes. From the extreme north toward the north-ea&s;t are Scythae. Without them, and beyond the beginnings of the north, &s;ome place the Hyperborei, whom more a&s;cribe to Europe. Thence fir&s;t is known the pronontory of Celtica Lytarmis, and the river Carambucis, where, burdened with the force of the &s;tars, the chain of Riphaean mountains fails. There we have reports of Arimphaei, a nation not di&s;&s;imilar to the Hyperborei.... Beyond them <HI>(on the right, or ea&s;t)</HI> are the Scythae, Cimmerii, Ci&s;&s;ian|thi, Georgi, and Amazons. The&s;e reach to the Ca&s;|pian and Hyrcanian &s;ea. For it bur&s;ts out of the Scythic ocean into the back parts of A&s;ia ... It bur&s;ts in by narrow mouths but of great length.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>Pliny's geography of the north is here given, as the mo&s;t full and curious of all antiquity. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that Pliny's whole geography has not been printed &s;eparate, as far &s;uperior to that of Mela and others. Indeed an edition of Pliny by a &s;ociety of literati is much wanted; for Harduin, the late&s;t editor, was of all men the mo&s;t unfit for the ta&s;k, being ra&s;h and wrong-headed to a mon&s;trous degree.</P>
<P>The bounds of ancient knowlege on the We&s;t and South are fixt and clear. On the Ea&s;t D' Anville has
<PB N="203" REF="677">fully &s;ettled it, as in the map attending this work. But the Northern, the mo&s;t important of all to the hi&s;tory of Europe, D' Anville leaves as Cluverius ignorantly puts it; and has thus left a prodigious ta&s;k to &s;ucceeding geographers.</P>
<P>The Riphaean mountains of Pliny (as of Ptolemy) palpably run from Ea&s;t to We&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So Ju&s;tin "Scythia, in orientem porrecta, clauditur ab uno latere Ponto, et ab altero Montibus Riphaeis; a tergo A&s;ia, et Ta|nai flumine." <HI>lib.</HI> II. Thus the Riphaean Mountains ran parallel to the Euxine.</NOTE>, as he pa&s;&s;es them to go to the Scythic Ocean. It is clear from Ptolemy, that they ran along the head of Tanais; and are often named with Tanais by the ancients, for by all ancient accounts the Tanais ro&s;e in them. No &s;uch mountains exi&s;t in Poland, or Ru&s;&s;ia. But this is nothing to the matter. The que&s;tion is what the ancients thought. And it is clear that they often confounded a Fore&s;t with a chain of Mountains, as Pliny here does the Hercynian Fore&s;t. No wonder then that in civilized times no &s;uch Moun|tains, otherwi&s;e Fore&s;ts, are to be found. The Riphae|an Fore&s;t, i am convinced, was that now called Vol|kon&s;ki, &s;till 150 miles long from the we&s;t, to Mo&s;cow on the ea&s;t. It is al&s;o a range of &s;mall hills. See Coxe's Travels.</P>
<P>Timaeus, as we learn from other pa&s;&s;ages of Pliny, called this ile oppo&s;ite Raunonia by the name Baltia. It is therefore a &s;lip of Pliny when he puts this among the namele&s;s iles.</P>
<P>What river the ancients called Paropami&s;us is doubt|ful. There was a mountain and region Paropami&s;us, at the head of the Indus. The Amalchian was evidently the ea&s;tern part of the Scythic Ocean. Pre&s;ent <HI>Sara&s;u,</HI> or &s;ome other river running north on the ea&s;t of the Ca&s;pian, may be Paropami&s;us.</P>
<P>The Cimbri, all know, were on the we&s;t of the Baltic, a part of the &s;uppo&s;ed Scythic Ocean of the an|cients. The promontory Rubeas &s;eems to me that on the we&s;t of the mouth of the river Rubo, or Dwina. being the northern point of pre&s;ent Courland. Cluve|rius, who puts it in the north of Lapland, &s;hews &s;trange ignorance. The ancients knew no more of Lapland than of America: and were never further north than Shetland (the real ancient Thule, as D' Anville &s;hews) and the &s;outh parts of Scandinavia. The Cronian
<PB N="204" REF="678">&s;eems here the north-ea&s;t part of the Baltic: but other ancients &s;uppo&s;ed the Cronian to extend over all the north parts of their Scandinavia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Oceanus Deucaledonius</HI> is, by Ptolemy, accounted an ex|te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ion of the Baltic, or <HI>Sarmaticus,</HI><GAP DESC="foreign">, vii. 5. and he &s;ays expre&s;sly, i. 3. that it was on the <HI>North</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) of Britain.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As Pliny tells us repeatedly in other places that Baltia, or Ba&s;ilia, was the ile where only amber was found, it is clearly Gle&s;&s;aria of Pru&s;&s;ia, not Scandinavia. The iles Oonae, &amp;c. all grant to be tho&s;e of Oe&s;el, &amp;c. at the mouth of the Finni&s;h gulf. The fables aro&s;e from &s;ome &s;trange peculiarity of dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Pliny then comes we&s;t to Germany, and tells us that the Ingaevones are the fir&s;t German people on that &s;ide. A &s;trong proof of his own a&s;&s;ertion, that Germany was then little known. For Tacitus found the Ba&s;ternae on that &s;ide, as did Ptolemy. The Ingaevones, accord|ing to Pliny's own account, were the Chauci, &amp;c. who were all on the we&s;t, not the ea&s;t, &s;o that he errs <HI>toto caelo.</HI> Indeed Pliny may be excu&s;ed if, as Tacitus &s;ays, the Ingaevones were all tho&s;e on the ocean, &s;o as to include the Northern or Scythic Ocean.</P>
<P>Cluverius is &s;o utterly fooli&s;h as to put the <HI>Sevo Mons</HI> of Pliny in Norway; in which childi&s;h blunder he is blindly followed, as u&s;ual, by Cellarius, and by D' Anville, which la&s;t has not examined one tittle of the ancient geography of Germany, tho the mo&s;t important of all to the hi&s;tory of Europe. Pliny's Sevo Mons is actually that chain between Pru&s;&s;ia and Sile&s;ia, called <HI>A&s;ciburgius Mons</HI> by Ptolemy, and now <HI>Zottenberg.</HI> This is clear from Pliny's words. He mentions the Scythic Ocean, then comes we&s;t to the Baltic, and ile Baltia or Gle&s;&s;aria, a penin&s;ula of pre&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia; then &s;peaks of the <HI>Hipp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">podum in&s;ulae,</HI> by all granted to be Oe&s;el and Dego at the mouth of the Dwina. 'Thence a clearer account begins to be opened from the nation of Ingae|vones, the fir&s;t of Germany on that &s;ide. There the immen&s;e mountains of Sevo, not le&s;s than the Riphaean, form a va&s;t bay even to the promontory of the Cimbri, which bay is called Codanus and is full of iles. Of which iles Scandinavia is of unknown &s;ize,' &amp;c. No|thing can be more clear than this, and the &s;tupidity of Cluverius is amazing. Had the Sevo Mons been in Norway, as he lays it down, it would have formed a
<PB N="205" REF="679"><HI>&s;trait</HI> with the <HI>Promontorium Cimbrorum,</HI> or north point of Jutland; and not a <HI>bay,</HI> as Pliny &s;tates. And how a range of mountains in Scandinavia could form that bay in which Scandinavia &s;tood, is left to tho&s;e ver&s;ant in &s;oleci&s;ms to decide. We mu&s;t ever e&s;timate ancient geography by ancient opinions. Pliny <HI>thought</HI> that the Sevo Mons reached up from the mountains north of pre&s;ent Bohemia to that great promontory north of Dantzick (called <HI>Re&s;ehout</HI> and <HI>Heel,</HI> if i mi&s;take not,) and formed the <HI>Sinus Codanus</HI> extending thence to the north point of Jutland; and which is at pre&s;ent a great bay; being the whole &s;outh part of the Baltic; which, from Dantzick, runs north, and not we&s;t as before. In the map of modern Germany by Cluverius, this chain of mountains is fully marked, from the ea&s;t of Bohemia and Sile&s;ia up to the Re&s;ehout. Tacitus mentions this Sevo Mons, tho he gives not the name, as dividing the Suevi from north to &s;outh. Solinus gives the Sevo Mons as Pliny, and puts it among the Ingaevones, to whom he al&s;o a&s;&s;igns the Vi&s;tula, &s;o that the ca&s;e is clear. Tacitus, who was far better informed than Pliny, &s;hews that Pliny's &s;tatement of the Ingaevones is right here, tho erroneous afterward, for that name included all the nations on the Baltic; and the Van|dili of Pliny were Ingaevones. Mo&s;t ancients regarded the Vi&s;tula as the ea&s;tern bound of Germany, and the Ba&s;ternae as a German nation out of Germany; &s;o that the Sevo Mons, as running along the Vi&s;|&s;tula, was on the ea&s;tern extremity of Germany, as Pliny &s;tates.</P>
<P>The Scandinavia of Pliny is the larger Scandia of Ptolemy, not reaching beyond the Wener Lake, as be|fore explained. The Hilleviones were in Haland (Hyl <HI>or</HI> Hal <HI>Mons,</HI> I&s;l.) The 'other world', here applied to Scandinavia, is al&s;o by Pliny u&s;ed in &s;peaking of Ta|probana, or Ceylon, &s;o that it's weight can be e&s;timated. Eningia may be the &s;outh part of Finland, perhaps by the ancients believed another ile in the Scythic Ocean. The Venedi were Sarmatae beyond the Vi&s;tula: beyond them Tacitus found the Fins: and the Scirri and Hirri &s;eem Finni&s;h nations, noted in later Roman hi&s;tory, for the &s;outhern Fins were not unwarlike. Lithuania is held by them, and they &s;eized on part of Hungary. The Scirri and Hirri were on the Finni&s;h gulf; and known in the Ninth century, as appears from the Peri|plus

But compare the pa&s;&s;age; and &s;ee <HI>Virland</HI> in the maps to Snorro, <HI>Havnioe,</HI> 1777, &amp;c.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The gulf Cylipenus is apparently that of Finland; Lagnus another name for the &s;outh of the Baltic or Codanus. Pliny having various authors before him was confounded with various names for the &s;ame &s;ubject. Cartris is <HI>Wend-&s;y&s;&s;el</HI> on the north of Jutland, a penin|&s;ula &s;o called from <HI>Wend</HI> (our <HI>Kent</HI> or <HI>Cant</HI>) a point or head-land. Burchana is Funen, or Zeeland, iles of the Suiones.</P>
<P>Pliny's Divi&s;ions of Germans are not unexception|able. The Vandili were by his own account Ingaevones, as above &s;hewn. Of them the Varini were quite on the We&s;t, next the Angli, as perfectly known from Tacitus, and the <HI>Leges Warinorum et Anglorum</HI> &s;till extant, and publi&s;hed by Leibnitz. The other three were all together, quite on the ea&s;t. So that Pliny's accuracy is not great. The Cimbri, Teutoni, Chauci, were all on the we&s;tern ocean; yet Pliny had placed the Ingaevones on the ea&s;t! The I&s;taevones were really next the Rhine; but Tacitus found no Cimbri Mediterranei there: The other two divi&s;ions are right. But Tacitus is the author to be depended on, as to Germany: Pliny's de&s;cription is however valuable.</P>
<P>The Second Extract from lib. VI. c. 14. rather con|cerns the north of Europe than of A&s;ia. The Tanais or Don was the ancient, as the modern, boundary of A&s;ia and Europe. But on the north moderns have ex|tended it to the Uralian Mountains, along the river Oby; while the ancients brought it much farther we&s;t, following the Tanais, which runs &s;outh-ea&s;t. The ea&s;t end of the Gulf of Finland was of cour&s;e the ancient boundary between A&s;ia and Europe. Here then Pliny begins and goes to the ea&s;t, along the &s;hores of a non|exi&s;tent ocean, the Scythic, till he comes to the river Volga; which, with many of the ancients, he thought
<PB N="207" REF="683">was an inlet between the Scythic Ocean and Ca&s;pian &s;ea Thus all the nations and places here mentioned are to be &s;ought for in the &s;outh-we&s;t of pre&s;ent Ru&s;&s;ia. The Scythae are about Smolenzko: the Hyperborei he re|tracts, as by other ancients they are placed in pre&s;ent Pru&s;&s;ia. Lytarmis which, like his Tabis beyond the Seres in A&s;ia, is a non-exi&s;tent promontory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Greek <GAP DESC="foreign">, however, and Latin <HI>promontorium,</HI> al&s;o &s;ig|nify merely the &s;ummit, or the termination, of a chain of mountains.</NOTE> of mere fable, he puts about pre&s;ent Mo&s;cow: as were the Arim|phaei. Carambucis &s;eems the river Sura. The other nations lay on the Volga down to the Ca&s;pian. The Georgi and Amazons, as well known, were between the Tanais and Volga, above the Alani. The opinion of a Scythic ocean &s;eems to have prevailed in the Eleventh century, for Adam of Bremen &s;ays people could &s;ail from the Baltic down to Greece. It &s;eems al&s;o the <HI>Ocean of Darkne&s;s</HI> in Ea&s;tern writings. I know not if it's exi&s;tence was not believed in Europe till the Six|teenth century.</P>
