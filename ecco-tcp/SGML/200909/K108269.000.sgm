<HEAD>THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE AFRICAN SLAVE-TRADE has been publicly &s;upported and encouraged by <HI>the Legi&s;lature of this King|dom</HI> for near a century la&s;t pa&s;t; &s;o that the <HI>mon&s;trous de&s;truction of the Human Species,</HI> which is <HI>annually</HI> occa&s;ioned thereby, may certainly be e&s;teemed a <HI>National Crime</HI> of the mo&s;t aggravating kind, which (according to the u&s;ual cour&s;e of God's Providence in the World) will probably draw down &s;ome exemplary vengeance upon the unre|penting Inhabitants of this I&s;land! And, with re&s;pect to the <HI>Briti&s;h Colonies,</HI> the
<PB N="2" REF="5">uncharitable practice of <HI>Slave-holding,</HI> e&s;pecially in the We&s;t-India I&s;lands and the more Southern Colonies, is grown up into a more enormous and de&s;tructive <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> (whether we view the prodi|gious multitudes of the <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> or the uncon&s;cionable &s;everity of the <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ors</HI>) than perhaps ever di&s;graced any other Nation at any one period of time!</P>
<P>The &s;everal attempts that have lately been made to ju&s;tify the&s;e two branches of abominable National Iniquity by the Holy Scriptures, and e&s;pecially by the permi&s;&s;ion therein granted to <HI>the I&s;raelites</HI> to <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> and <HI>retain Slaves</HI> among them, have induced me to collect, from the Hi&s;tory of <HI>the Jews</HI> in the &s;everal Books of Holy Scripture, &s;ome plain examples of God's Vengeance upon that particular Nation, expre&s;sly for this kind of <HI>Op|pre&s;&s;ion;</HI> which, I hope, will &s;ufficiently prove that <HI>Slavery</HI> was ever dete&s;table in
<PB N="3" REF="6">the &s;ight of God, and con&s;equently that a &s;peedy Reformation is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary (as well with re&s;pect to the <HI>African Slave-trade,</HI> encouraged in this Kingdom, as the <HI>Toleration of Slavery</HI> in the Briti&s;h American Dominions) if we mean to entertain the lea&s;t hope of e&s;caping a &s;evere <HI>National Retribution,</HI> which (if we may judge by our pre&s;ent Civil Di&s;&s;entions and horrid <HI>mutual</HI> Slaughters of <HI>National Brethren</HI>) &s;eem ready to bur&s;t upon us!</P>
<P>I am well aware, indeed, how very unfa&s;hionable it is, now-a-days, to quote <HI>Scripture,</HI> when matters of <HI>Law, Politics,</HI> or <HI>Trade</HI> are called in que&s;tion; yet I flat|ter my&s;elf that the following examples, drawn from thence, are perfectly &s;uitable to my pre&s;ent point, and con&s;equently mu&s;t have weight to convince all per&s;ons, who &s;incerely acknowledge the <HI>Truth of the Scriptures,</HI> that we have the greate&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="7">rea&s;on to apprehend the infliction of &s;ome heavy Judgement from Almighty God upon the&s;e Kingdoms, on account of the mon&s;trous load of Guilt which the Briti&s;h Subjects, <HI>on each &s;ide of the Atlan|tic,</HI> have incurred by the <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> above-mentioned.</P>
<P>In &s;ome former Tracts I have already &s;hewn that the Servitude which the Jews, by the Mo&s;aic Law, were permitted to exact of <HI>their Brethren</HI> (even when the latter were <HI>&s;old</HI> to them) was very much <HI>limited;</HI> that they were not to be treated as <HI>Bond Servants</HI> <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><Q>If thy <HI>Brother</HI> (that dwelleth) by thee be waxen poor, and be <HI>&s;old unto thee,</HI> thou &s;halt not compel him to &s;erve as <HI>a Bond Servant:</HI> but as an Hired Servant, and as a Sojourner, he &s;hall be with thee,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Levit. xxv. 39, 40.</NOTE> but as <HI>Hired Ser|vants;</HI> that the <HI>Servitude</HI> could not law|fully be extended beyond <HI>&s;even years</HI> <NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><Q>If thou buy an Hebrew Servant, &s;ix years he &s;hall &s;erve, and in the &s;eventh he &s;hall go out free for nothing.</Q> Exod. xxi. 2.</NOTE>
<PB N="5" REF="8">unle&s;s the Servant loved <HI>his Ma&s;ter</HI> and Condition, and voluntarily demanded<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>And if the Servant &s;hall <HI>plainly</HI> &s;ay, <HI>I love</HI> my Ma&s;ter, my Wife, and my Children; <HI>I will not go out free:</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Exod. xxi. 5. Thus it is evident that the Jews could not acquire <HI>any right</HI> to the perpe|tual Service of their <HI>Brethren,</HI> John or Thomas, except by virtue of <HI>a voluntary Contract,</HI> which is &s;omething &s;imilar to that Clau&s;e in the Habeas Corpus Act con|cerning a Contract, which I thought my&s;elf obliged to acknowledge in my former Tract as an exception to the idea of Univer&s;al <HI>Freedom</HI> in this Kingdom. But in neither ca&s;e can the <HI>Contract</HI> for Service be <HI>im|plied;</HI> for in the latter the Contract mu&s;t be <HI>in writing,</HI> and the &s;igning be clearly proved to be <HI>a voluntary act,</HI> without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of <HI>Dure&s;s;</HI> and in the for|mer ca&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary that the Servant &s;hould ac|knowledge, in <HI>a Court of Record,</HI> that he was <HI>willing</HI> to enter into &s;uch a Contract; for the Hebrew <HI>Servant</HI> could not be made a <HI>Slave,</HI> unle&s;s he would <Q><HI>plainly &s;ay,</HI> I love my Ma&s;ter,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>I WILL NOT GO OUT FREE: Then</Q> (&s;ays the Text) <Q>his Ma&s;ter &s;hall bring him <HI>unto the</HI> JUDGES</Q> (which an|&s;wers to the public <HI>Acknowledgement</HI> nece&s;&s;ary in the other ca&s;e to be made in <HI>a Court of Record</HI>) for with|out this the Hebrew Ma&s;ter had no authority to bore the Servant's Ear in token of Bondage. Exod. xxi. 5, 6.</P></NOTE> of him to continued in his Service; and that, in every other ca&s;e, it was
<PB N="6" REF="9">ab&s;olutely unlawful to hold a Brother Hebrew in Slavery.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e &s;hewn, that, under the glorious Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel, we are ab&s;olutely bound to con&s;ider our|&s;elves as <HI>Citizens of the World;</HI> that every Man whatever, without any <HI>partial di&s;|tinction</HI> of Nation, Di&s;tance, or Com|plexion, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be e&s;teemed <HI>our Neighbour,</HI> and <HI>our Brother;</HI> and that we are ab&s;olutely bound in Chri&s;tian Duty to entertain <HI>a Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> towards <HI>all Mankind</HI> as charitable and benevo|lent, <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> as that which was required of the Jews, under the Law, towards their <HI>national Brethren;</HI> and, con&s;e|quently, that it is ab&s;olutely unlawful for tho&s;e, <HI>who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians,</HI> to exact of <HI>their Brethren</HI> (I mean <HI>their Brethren of the Univer&s;e</HI>) a more burthen|&s;ome Service than that to which the Jews were limited with re&s;pect to their
<PB N="7" REF="10"><HI>Brethren</HI> of the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael; and the Slavery, or involuntary Bondage, of <HI>a Brother I&s;raelite</HI> was ab&s;olutely forbid.</P>
<P>The&s;e premi&s;es naturally lead us to con&s;ider the &s;evere NATIONAL JUDGE|MENTS which the Jews brought upon them&s;elves principally <HI>by exceeding the&s;e very limitations</HI> which I have here &s;peci|fied: and the inevitable conclu&s;ion to be drawn from the&s;e examples is, that we are <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> in danger of THE LIKE JUDGEMENTS, if we do not immediately put a &s;top to all <HI>&s;imilar Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> by <HI>Na|tional Authority:</HI> becau&s;e an uncharitable exten&s;ion of the <HI>&s;aid limits,</HI> by tho&s;e who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, will certainly be, at lea&s;t, <HI>as heinous in the &s;ight of God</HI> as the OPPRESSION OF BRETHREN under the Law; and probably much more &s;o, if we con&s;ider the purity and benevo|lence which is required of all Men under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation: and I have
<PB N="8" REF="11">clearly proved (I tru&s;t) that the permi&s;|&s;ion to the I&s;raelites, to keep <HI>Bondmen of the Heathen</HI> (or more properly the <HI>Na|tions, <GAP DESC="foreign">) that were round about them,</HI> and of <Q>the Children of <HI>the Strangers</HI> that dwelt among them,</Q> cannot be extended to <HI>any other People</HI> whatever except <HI>the I&s;raelites</HI> them&s;elves; and that even to them it was only <HI>temporary,</HI> during the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Mo&s;aic Law, whil&s;t they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Land of Canaan, the former Inhabitants of which (<HI>viz.</HI> the &s;even abominable <HI>Nations</HI> of Pale&s;tine, expre&s;sly mentioned by name in the &s;eventh Chapter of Deuteronomy, where the &s;ame Heb.

Deut. vii. 16.</NOTE>, and to make <HI>no Covenant</HI>

<P><HI>National</HI> Wickedne&s;s, from the be|ginning of the World, has generally been vi&s;ited with <HI>National</HI> Puni&s;hments: and &s;urely no <HI>National</HI> Wickedne&s;s can be more heinous in the &s;ight of God,
<PB N="11" REF="14">than a public toleration of <HI>Slavery and Oppre&s;&s;ion!</HI> for Tyranny (in what&s;oever &s;hape it appears) mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be e&s;teemed a pre&s;umptuous breach of that Divine Command, in which <Q><HI>all Law is fulfilled</HI></Q> (Gal. v. 14.) <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy&s;elf.</Q> Levit. xix. 18.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tories of all Nations, indeed, afford tremendous examples of <HI>God's Vengeance</HI> again&s;t Tyrants; but no Hi&s;|tory is &s;o proper to illu&s;trate this &s;ub|ject (which now &s;o nearly concerns us) as that of the Jews: for as the Know|ledge of the <HI>Divine Law</HI> was revealed in a more particular manner to <HI>that People,</HI> and to others <HI>only through them,</HI> &s;o the effect even of their Di&s;obedience was an exemplary demon&s;tration, from time to time, of <HI>God's Vengeance,</HI> as well as of <HI>his Mercy,</HI> for the in&s;truction of all other Nations, among&s;t whom they
<PB N="12" REF="15">are now di&s;per&s;ed, as living monuments of the &s;ame to this very day: and we have the authority of an Apo&s;tle<NOTE N="(6)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 11.</NOTE> to a&s;&s;ert, that <Q>all the&s;e things happened unto them for en&s;amples; and they are written</Q> (&s;ays he) <Q>for our ad|monition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</Q></P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ignal in|&s;tances of Mercy which the Almighty was plea&s;ed to &s;hew that People, after they <HI>became a Nation,</HI> was, the re&s;toring them to their <HI>Natural Freedom</HI> from the deplorable <HI>Slavery</HI> in which they were detained by a tyrannical Egyptian Monarch<NOTE N="(7)" PLACE="foot"><P>&mdash; <Q>the Children of I&s;rael &s;ighed by rea&s;on of <HI>the Bondage,</HI> and <HI>they cried;</HI> and their cry came up unto God <HI>by rea&s;on of the Bondage:</HI> and God <HI>heard their groaning,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Exod. ii. 23, 24.</P>
<P><Q>And the Lord &s;aid, I have <HI>&s;urely &s;een the Affliction of my People</HI> which are in Egypt, and have <HI>heard their cry</HI> by rea&s;on of their <HI>Ta&s;k-ma&s;ters:</HI> for I know their Sorrows, and I am come down <HI>to deli|ver them</HI> out of the hand of the Egyptians.</Q> Exod. iii. 7, 8.</P></NOTE>: and the tremendous
<PB N="13" REF="16">Judgements whereby this deliverance was effected (<HI>viz.</HI> the Plagues of Egypt) are &s;o many &s;ignal examples of <HI>God's &s;evere Vengeance again&s;t Slave-holders,</HI> which ought to be had in everla&s;ting remembrance, to warn all Nations of the World again&s;t the unnatural and baneful practice of <HI>keeping Slaves.</HI></P>
<P>This deliverance from <HI>Bondage</HI> was frequently mentioned, even in the words of God him&s;elf, by his Prophets, from time to time (as I have before remarked) &mdash;"Thus &s;aith the Lord" (<HI>i. e.</HI> Jeho|vah) <Q>God of I&s;rael: I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth <HI>out of the Hou&s;e of Bondage;</HI></Q> (<GAP DESC="foreign">, more <HI>literally</HI> <Q>from the Hou&s;e

<P>The I&s;raelites them&s;elves were al&s;o particularly directed <HI>to remember</HI> this &s;ignal exertion of Divine Mercy and Power in the cau&s;e of <HI>Popular Freedom: "Remember</HI> that thou wa&s;t <HI>a Servant" (viz. a Slave)</HI> <Q>in the Land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God <HI>brought thee out</HI> thence <HI>through a mighty hand,</HI> and by a &s;tretched-out arm,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Deut. v. 15.</P>

<P>The Prophet afterwards proceeds (in the 5th, 6th, and 7th ver&s;es of his Remon&s;trance to the King and Court) to declare the certainty of De&s;olation and <HI>Vengeance,</HI> if they would not hear his words; and in the 8th and 9th ver&s;es he a&s;&s;igns a general Rea&s;on<NOTE N="(92)" PLACE="foot"><P><Q><HI>And many Nations &s;hall pa&s;s by this City, and they &s;hall &s;ay every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the</HI> LORD <HI>done thus unto this great City?

<PB N="143" REF="146">to the &s;ubject of difference between them and me.

<P>Chri&s;t him&s;elf has taught us, that <Q>NO MAN CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS: <HI>for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or el&s;e he will hold to the one, and de&s;pi&s;e the other:</HI></Q> and then he immediately adds, <HI>"Ye cannot &s;erve</HI> GOD <HI>and Mammon."</HI> Mat. vi. 24. and Luke xvi. 13. Here the <HI>Service of Mammon</HI> is placed in as direct oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Service of</HI> GOD, as ever was the Service of <HI>Baal, Moloch,</HI> or <HI>Chemo&s;h;</HI> though the fir&s;t means not any particular <HI>Idol,</HI> but only the baneful influence of <HI>Riches,</HI> or the undue preva|lence of <HI>private intere&s;t</HI> over all &s;en&s;e of Religion, Ju&s;|tice, and Virtue! In like manner <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> (which
<PB N="144" REF="147">includes all that I have &s;aid of <HI>Mammon</HI>) is frequently mentioned in Scripture as downright <HI>Idolatry:</HI> <Q><HI>For this ye know</HI></Q> (&s;aid the Apo&s;tle Paul to the Ephe&s;ians, chap. v. 5.), <Q><HI>that no Whoremonger,</HI> nor <HI>unclean per|&s;on,</HI> nor COVETOUS MAN, WHO IS AN IDO|LATER, <HI>hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Chri&s;t and of God.</HI></Q> And in the Epi&s;tle to the Co|lo&s;&s;ians the &s;ame Apo&s;tle warns us again&s;t &s;ome of the common Vices which draw down the Wrath of God, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>Fornication, Uncleanne&s;s, inordinate Affection, evil Concupi&s;cence,</HI> and COVETOUSNESS, <HI>which is</HI> IDOLATRY.</Q> Col. iii. 5.</P>

<P>Thus it is clearly demon&s;trable (I tru&s;t) that Man|kind may be guilty of <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and of <HI>&s;erving Devils,</HI> without paying any per&s;onal Adoration to their <HI>Idols;</HI> and on this I found my warning not only to <HI>Slave-dealers</HI> and <HI>Slave-holders,</HI> but al&s;o to my Countrymen

<P>The importation of &s;laves into the colonies from the coa&s;t of Africa hath long been con&s;idered as a trade of <HI>great Inhumanity,</HI> and under its pre&s;ent en|couragement, we have too much rea&s;on to fear <HI>will endanger the very exi&s;tence of your Maje&s;ty's American dominions.</HI></P>
<P>We are &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome of your Maje&s;ty's &s;ub|jects in Great Britain may reap emolument from this &s;ort of Traffic; but when we con&s;ider that it greatly retards the &s;ettlement of the colonies with <HI>more white inhabitants,</HI> and may <HI>in time have the mo&s;t de&s;tructive influence,</HI> we pre&s;ume to hope, that the intere&s;t of a few will be di&s;regarded, when placed in competition with the &s;ecurity and happine&s;s of &s;uch numbers of your Maje&s;ty's dutiful and loyal &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>Your Maje&s;ty's antient colony and dominion of Virginia hath at all times, and upon every occa&s;ion, been entirely devoted to your Maje&s;ty's facred per&s;on and government; and we cannot forego this oppor|tunity of renewing tho&s;e a&s;&s;urances of the true&s;t loy|alty and warme&s;t affection, which we have &s;o often, with the greate&s;t &s;ineerity, given to the be&s;t of Kings, who&s;e wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s we e&s;teem the &s;ure&s;t pledge of the happine&s;s of all his people.</P>

<P>THAT the importation of the natives of Guinea, to be &s;old and u&s;ed as &s;laves in the provinces and i&s;lands of the Briti&s;h dominions in America, has long been an occa&s;ion of deep concern to a great number of the Inhabitants of this province, as well on account of its incon&s;i&s;tency with the whole tenor of the Chri&s;tian religion, as becau&s;e of the evil in|fluence it has on the religious and moral conduct of the people, and the dreadful con&s;equence which, it is to be feared, will one day attend in tho&s;e parts where it prevails.</P>

<PB N="338" REF="342">MAGNA CARTA, <HI>and was again e&s;tabli&s;hed by</HI> STATUTE 25 <HI>Edward</HI> III. <HI>St.</HI> 6. &sect; 3.</Q> <HI>Ibid.</HI> This Statute fir&s;t gave <HI>parliamentary authority,</HI> indeed, to the King's <HI>Cong&eacute; D' E&s;lire</HI> (though it was in u&s;e long before), and acknowledges the King's Right of <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> or Approbation <HI>"after the Election;"</HI> yet it contains nothing which can remove the prudent and rea&s;onable limitation to which that <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> or <HI>Approbation</HI> was formerly &s;ub|ject, <HI>viz.</HI> that it <Q>WAS NOT TO BE DENIED WITHOUT A REASONABLE AND LAWFUL CAUSE.</Q> Judge Black&s;tone, b. i. c. 11. p. 379. And this very Act (which was manife&s;tly ordained to re&s;train the &s;imoniacal practices and &s;hameful u&s;urpa|tions of the Bi&s;hops of Rome) expre&s;sly acknowledges the Right of FREE ELECTIONS in the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>that the FREE ELECTIONS of the Archbi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, and all other Dignities and Benefices ELECTIVE <HI>in England,</HI> &s;hall hold,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Right</HI> was al&s;o fully e&s;tabli&s;hed by preceding Statutes, &s;till <HI>in force,</HI> though (unhappily for this Kingdom) not <HI>in u&s;e;</HI> as &mdash;"<HI>There &s;hall be</HI> FREE ELECTION <HI>of Dignities of the Church.</HI>" 9 Edward II. c. 14. Title. And again, <Q>ELECTIONS OUGHT TO BE FREE.</Q> 3 Edward I. c. 5. Mr. Ruffhead, in his u&s;eful Index to the Statutes, very properly refers us, under the head of "ELECTION of BISHOPS," to this la&s;t-mentioned
<PB N="339" REF="343">Statute; for <HI>Epi&s;copal Elections</HI> ought certainly to be included in the meaning of the &s;aid Statute, as well as <HI>all other Elections;</HI> for an ELECTION without a CHOICE is a manife&s;t contradiction in term<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and NO ELECTION.</P>
<PB N="336" REF="340"></NOTE> abovemen|tioned, and is entirely de&s;tructive of all the de&s;irable purpo&s;es of a free <HI>Election.</HI> This practice, however, cannot be cen&s;ured in &s;tronger terms than tho&s;e in
