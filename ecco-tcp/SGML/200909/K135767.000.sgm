<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following E&s;&s;ay, though wrote, as the Author &s;ignifies, in ha&s;te, is thought to have &s;uch merit as to de|&s;erve a publication.&mdash;The copy was &s;ent to one of the Writer's particular friends, whe|ther for his own peculiar &s;atisfaction, or the pre&s;s, is uncertain; but as the &s;ubject is <HI>Liber|ty,</HI> &s;o it is expected the <HI>Freedom</HI> which is here taken cannot ju&s;tly give him offence, or be unacceptable to the publick.</P>
<P>IT was de&s;igned to confute a piece wrote by Thomas Thomp&s;on, M. A. &s;ome time fellow of C. C. C. entitled, <Q>The African trade for Negro Slaves &s;hewn to be con&s;i&s;tent with principles of humanity, and with the laws of revealed religion.</Q> Printed at Can|terbury.</P>
<P>IN order to &s;hew that the E&s;&s;ay Writer has not mi&s;repre&s;ented the text, nor is &s;ingle in his ob&s;ervations upon it, the &s;entiments of the Monthly Reviewers on that pamphlet in May 1772 are here in&s;erted.</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t acknowledge," &s;ay they, <Q>that the branch of trade here under con&s;i|deration is a &s;pecies of traffick which we
<PB N="iv" REF="3">have never been able to reconcile with the dictates of humanity, and much le&s;s with tho&s;e of religion. The principal ar|gument in its behalf &s;eems to be, the <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ity</HI> of &s;uch a re&s;ource, in order to carry on the works in our plantations, which, we are told, it is otherwi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible to perform. But this, though the urgency of the ca&s;e may be very great, is not by any means &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the practice. There is a farther con&s;ideration which has a plau&s;ible appearance, and may be thought to carry &s;ome weight; it is, that the mer|chant only purcha&s;es tho&s;e who were &s;laves before, and po&s;&s;ibly may, rather than otherwi&s;e, render their &s;ituation more tole|rable. But it is well known, that the lot of our Slaves, when mo&s;t favourably con&s;i|dered, is very hard and mi&s;erable; be|&s;ides which, &s;uch a trade is taking the advantage of the ignorance and bruta|lity of unenlightened nations, who are encouraged to war with each other for this very purpo&s;e, and, it is to be feared, are &s;ometimes tempted to &s;eize tho&s;e of their own tribes or families that they may ob|tain the hoped for advantage: and it is owned, with regard to our merchants, that, upon occa&s;ion, they ob&s;erve the like practices, which are thought to be allow|able, becau&s;e they are done by way of repri&s;al for theft or damage committed by the natives. We were plea&s;ed, however,
<PB N="v" REF="4">to meet with a pamphlet on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion; and we entered upon its peru&s;al with the hopes of finding &s;ome|what advanced which might afford us &s;atis|faction on this difficult point. The writer appears to be a &s;en&s;ible man, and capa|ble of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the argument; but the limits to which he is confined render his performance rather &s;uperficial. The plea he produces from the Jewi&s;h law is not, in our view of the matter, at all conclu&s;ive. The people of I&s;rael were under a <HI>theo|cracy,</HI> in which the Supreme Being was in a peculiar &s;en&s;e their King, and might therefore i&s;&s;ue forth &s;ome orders for them, which it would not be warrantable for ano|ther people, who were in different circum|&s;tances, to ob&s;erve. Such, for in&s;tance, was the command given concerning the extirpation of the Canaanites, whom, the &s;overeign Arbiter of life and death might, if he had plea&s;ed, have de&s;troyed by plague or famine, or other of tho&s;e means which we term natural cau&s;es, and by which a wi&s;e Providence fulfils its own purpo&s;es. But it would be unrea&s;onable to infer from the manner in which the I&s;raelites dealt with the people of Canaan, that any other nations have a right to pur|&s;ue the &s;ame method. Neither can we imagine that St. Paul's exhortation to &s;er|vants or &s;laves, upon their conver&s;ion, to continue in the &s;tate in which chri&s;tianity
<PB N="vi" REF="5">found them, affords any argument favour|able to the practice here pleaded for. It is no more than &s;aying, that Chri&s;tianity did not particularly enter into the regula|tions of civil &s;ociety at that time; that it taught per&s;ons to be contented and diligent in their &s;tations: but certainly it did not forbid them, in a proper and lawful way, if it was in their power, to render their circum&s;tances more comfortable. Upon the whole, we mu&s;t own, that this little treati&s;e is not convincing to us, though, as different per&s;ons are differently affected by the &s;ame con&s;iderations, it may prove more &s;atisfactory to others.</Q></P>
<P>IN another place they ob&s;erve, <Q>&s;ince we are <HI>all brethren,</HI> and God has given to <HI>all</HI> men a natural right to <HI>Liberty,</HI> we allow of no <HI>Slavery</HI> among us, unle&s;s a per&s;on for|feits his freedom by his crimes.</Q></P>
<P>THAT Slavery is not con&s;i&s;tent with the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, nor admi&s;&s;able in Great-Britain, appears evidently by the late &s;olemn determination in the court of King's Bench at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in the ca&s;e of &mdash; So|mer&s;et, the Negro;&mdash;and why it &s;hould be revived and continued in the colonies, peo|pled by the de&s;cendents of Britain, and ble&s;|&s;ed with &s;entiments as truly noble and free as any of their fellow &s;ubjects in the mother country, is not ea&s;ily conceived, nor can the di&s;tinction be well founded.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">IF <Q>natural rights, &s;uch as <HI>life</HI> and <HI>Liberty,</HI> receive no additional &s;trength from muni|cipal laws, nor any <HI>human legi&s;lature</HI> has <HI>power</HI> to abridge or <HI>de&s;troy them,</HI> unle&s;s the owner commits &s;ome act that amounts to a forfeiture:</Q>

<PB N="viii" REF="7">of ju&s;tice in England and America, as to be <HI>adjudged free</HI> in the one, and in the other held in the mo&s;t <HI>abject Slavery?</HI></P>
<P>WE are expre&s;sly re&s;trained from making laws "repugnant to," and directed to fa|&s;hion them, <Q>as nearly as may be, agreeable to, the laws of England.</Q> Hence, and be|cau&s;e of its total incon&s;i&s;tency with the prin|ciples of the con&s;titution, neither in Eng|land or any of the Colonies, is there one law directly in favour of, or enacting <HI>Slavery,</HI> but by a kind of &s;ide-wind, admitting its exi&s;tence, (though only founded on a barbarous cu&s;|tom, originated by foreigners) attempt its regulation. How far the point litigated in &mdash; Somer&s;et's ca&s;e would bear a fober candid di&s;cu&s;&s;ion before an impartial judica|ture in the colonies, I cannot determine; but, for the credit of my country, &s;hould hope it would meet with a like deci&s;ion, that it might appear, and be known, that <HI>Liberty</HI> in America is not a partial privilege, but extends to every individual in it.</P>
<P>I MIGHT here, in the language of the famous JAMES OTIS, E&s;q. a&s;k, <Q>Is it po&s;|&s;ible for a man to have a natural right to make a Slave of him&s;elf or of his po&s;teri|ty? What man is or ever was born free if every man is not? Can a father &s;uper&s;ede the laws of nature? Is not every man born as free by nature as his father?

Does it follow that it is right to en&s;lave a man becau&s;e he is black? Will &s;hort curled hair like wool, in&s;tead of chri&s;tians hair, as it is called by tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are as hard as the nether mill-&s;tone, help the argument? Can any logical inference in favour of Slavery, be drawn from a flat no&s;e, a long or a &s;hort face? Nothing better can be &s;aid in favour of <HI>a trade</HI> that is the mo&s;t &s;hocking violation of the laws of nature; has a di|rect tendency to dimini&s;h every idea of the ine&s;timable value of Liberty, and makes every dealer in it a tyrant, from the director of an African company, to the petty chap|man in needles and pins, on the unhap|py coa&s;t.</Q>

<P><PB N="x" REF="9">To tho&s;e who think Slavery founded in Scripture, a careful and attentive peru&s;al of the Sacred Writings would contribute more than any thing to eradicate the error; they will not find even the name <HI>Slave</HI> once mention|ed therein, and applied to a &s;ervitude to be continued from parent to child in perpetuity, with approbation&mdash;The term u&s;ed on the oc|ca&s;ion in the &s;acred text is <HI>Servant;</HI> and, upon a fair con&s;truction of tho&s;e writings, there is no nece&s;&s;ity, nor can the &s;ervice, con&s;i&s;tent with the whole tenor of the Scripture, be extended further than the generation &s;poken of; it was never intended to include the po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;taken proverb which prevailed in that early age, that <Q>The fathers had eaten four grapes, and the childrens teeth were &s;et on edge,</Q> was rectified by the pro|phets Jeremiah and Ezekiel, who declared to the people, that <Q>they &s;hould not have oc|ca&s;ion to u&s;e that proverb any more;&mdash; Behold all &s;ouls are mine, as the &s;oul of the father, &s;o the &s;oul of the &s;on, the &s;oul that &s;inneth it &s;hall die;&mdash;the &s;on &s;hall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither &s;hall the father bear the iniquity of the &s;on;&mdash;the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the righteous &s;hall be upon him, and the wickedne&s;s of the wicked &s;hall be upon him.</Q>

<P>BUT admitting Slavery to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by Scripture, the command of the Sove|reign Ruler of the univer&s;e, who&s;e eye takes in all things, and who, for good rea&s;ons, beyond our comprehen&s;ion, might ju&s;tly create a perpetual Slavery to effect his own purpo&s;es, again&s;t the enemies of his cho&s;en people in that day, cannot be pleaded now again&s;t any people on earth; it is not even pretended to in ju&s;tification of Negro Sla|very, nor can the &s;ons of Ethiopia, with any degree of clearne&s;s, be proved to have de&s;cended from any of tho&s;e nations who &s;o came under the Divine di&s;plea&s;ure as to be brought into &s;ervitude; if they are, and tho&s;e denunciations given in the Old Te&s;tament were perpetual, and continue in force, mu&s;t we not look upon it meritorious to execute them fully upon all the offspring of that unhappy people upon whom they fell, without giving quarter to any?</P>
<P>MANY who admit the indefen&s;ibility of Slavery, con&s;idering the &s;ubject rather too &s;uperficially, declare it would be impolitick to emancipate tho&s;e we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; and &s;ay, they generally behave ill when &s;et at
<PB N="xii" REF="11">liberty. I believe very few of the advocates for freedom think that all ought to be manu|mitted, nay, think it would be unju&s;t to turn out tho&s;e who have &s;pent their prime of life, and now require a &s;upport; but many are in a fit capacity to do for them&s;elves and the publick; as to the&s;e let every ma&s;ter or mi|&s;tre&s;s do their duty, and leave con&s;equences to the Di&s;po&s;er of events, who, I believe, will always ble&s;s our actions in proportion to the purity of their &s;pring. But many in|&s;tances might be given of Negroes and Mu|lattoes, once in Slavery, who, after they have obtained their liberty, (and &s;ometimes even in a &s;tate of bondage) have given &s;trik|ing proofs of their integrity, ingenuity, in|du&s;try, tenderne&s;s and nobility of mind; of which, if the limits of this little Piece per|mitted, I could mention many examples; and why in&s;tances of this kind are not more fre|quent, we may very naturally impute to the &s;mallne&s;s of the number tried with freedom, and the &s;ervility and meanne&s;s of their education whil&s;t in Slavery. Let us never forget, that an equal if not a greater proportion of our own colour behave wor&s;e with all the advantages of birth, education and circum&s;tances; and we &s;hall blu&s;h to oppo&s;e an equitable emancipa|tion, by this or the like arguments.</P>

<P>THE Editor is united in opinion with the author of the E&s;&s;ay, that Slavery is contrary to the laws of rea&s;on, and the principles of revealed religion; and believes it alike ini|mical and impolitick in every &s;tate and coun|try; for as <Q>righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation,

He will candidly confe&s;s to any one who &s;hall kindly point it out, any error which in this inquiry hath fell from his pen. There can be but one beatific point of rectitude, but many paths leading to it, in which per&s;ons differing in modes and non-e&s;&s;entials, may walk with freedom to their own opinions; we may much more innocently be under a mi&s;|take, than continue in it after a hint given, which occa&s;ions our adverting thereto; for it &s;eems a duty to inve&s;tigate the way of truth and ju&s;tice with our utmo&s;t ability.</P>
<P>A much more exten&s;ive and perfect view of the &s;ubject under con&s;ideration, has of late prevailed than formerly; and he believes nothing is wanting but an impartial di&s;|intere&s;ted attention to make &s;till greater advances. Thus, by a gradual progre&s;&s;ion, he hopes the name of <HI>Slavery</HI> will be eradicated
<PB N="xv" REF="14">by the general voice of mankind in this land of <HI>Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>THE mode of manumitting negroes in New-Jer&s;ey is &s;uch as appears terrific, and amounts almo&s;t to a prohibition, becau&s;e of its incum|bering con&s;equences, which few prudent peo|ple choo&s;e to leave their families liable to. It is much ea&s;ier in &s;everal other colonies. In Penn&s;ylvania a recognizance entered into in THIRTY POUNDS to indemnify the town&s;hip, is a complete di&s;charge. In Ma|ryland, where Negroes are &s;o numerous, I am informed, the ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s may at plea&s;ure give Liberty to their Slaves without the lea&s;t obligation, and be clear of any future burden. Both the&s;e are exceptionable, and may be improved. Proper di&s;tinctions are nece&s;&s;ary; for as the freedom of all gra|tis might be unju&s;t, not only to the publick but the Slave, &s;o any clog upon the owner who gives up his right at an age when he cannot have received much or any advantage from the labour of the individual, would be unrea&s;ona|ble. The wi&s;dom of a legi&s;lature earne&s;tly di&s;|po&s;ed to do good, will, I hope, be directed to &s;urmount every little difficulty in pointing out a &s;cheme more equal and perfect, by &s;teering a middle cour&s;e; and proper care being kindly taken to a&s;&s;i&s;t and provide for the u&s;efulne&s;s of tho&s;e de&s;erving objects of be|nevolence, the approbation of Divine Provi|dence will I doubt not attend &s;uch laudable endeavours, and crown them with &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;

<P>FROM Leviticus xxv. 39 to 46, he draws his principal conclu&s;ion, viz. <Q>that the buy|ing and &s;elling of Slaves <HI>is not contrary to the law of nature,</HI> for (&s;ays he) the <HI>Jewi&s;h con&s;titutions</HI> were &s;trictly therewith con&s;i&s;t|ent <HI>in all points:</HI> and the&s;e are in certain ca&s;es the rule by which is determined by <HI>learned lawyers</HI> and ca&s;ui&s;ts, what is, or is not <HI>contrary to nature.</HI></Q> I have not lei&s;ure to follow this author methodically, but will, neverthele&s;s, examine his ground <HI>in a general way,</HI> in order to prevent any ill u&s;e that may

<P>THE reverend Mr. Thomp&s;on'<HI>s premi&s;es are not true,</HI> for the Jewi&s;h con&s;titutions <HI>were not "&s;trictly con&s;i&s;tent"</HI> with the <HI>law of na|ture</HI> in all points, as he &s;uppo&s;es, and con&s;e|quently his principal <HI>conclu&s;ion</HI> thereupon is erroneous. Many things were formerly tole|rated among the I&s;raelites, merely through the mercy and forbearance of God, in con&s;i|deration of their extreme frailty and inabili|ty, at that time, to bear a more perfect &s;y&s;tem of law. Other laws there are in the five books (be&s;ides the ceremonial laws now abro|gated) which are merely <HI>municipal,</HI> being a|dapted to the peculiar polity of the I&s;raeliti&s;h commonwealth, on account of its &s;ituation in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t barbarous nations, whom the Hebrews were at all times but too much inclined to imitate.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;al <HI>moral laws,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>na|tural equity</HI> are, indeed, every where plenti|fully inter&s;per&s;ed among the <HI>peculiar laws</HI> above-mentioned; but they may very ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed by every &s;incere chri&s;tian, who examines them with <HI>a liberal mind,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>benevolent purpo&s;e</HI> of the Divine Author is <HI>always apparent</HI> in tho&s;e laws which are to be <HI>eternally binding;</HI> for <Q>it is <HI>the rea&s;on</HI> of the law which con&s;titutes the <HI>life of the law,</HI></Q> according to an allowed maxim of our own
<PB N="19" REF="18">country, "Ratio Legis e&s;t anima Legis," (Jenk. Cent. 45.) And with re&s;pect to the&s;e <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>equitable</HI> laws, I will readily agree with the reverend Mr. Thomp&s;on, that they are the be&s;t rule by which <Q>learned judges and ca&s;ui&s;ts can determine what is, or is not, <HI>contrary to nature.</HI></Q></P>
<P>BUT I will now give a few examples of laws, which are in <HI>them&s;elves contrary to na|ture or natural equity,</HI> in order to &s;hew that Mr. Thomp&s;on'<HI>s premi&s;es</HI> are totally fal&s;e:</P>
<P>THE I&s;raelites were expre&s;sly <HI>permitted by the law of Mo&s;es</HI> to give a bill of divorce to their wives whenever they plea&s;ed, and to marry <HI>other women;</HI> and the women, who were put away, were al&s;o expre&s;sly permitted, by the Mo&s;aic Law, <HI>to marry again,</HI> during the lives of their former hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>ALL which practices were manife&s;tly con|trary to <HI>the law of nature</HI> in its purity, though not perhaps to <HI>the nature of our corrupt affec|tions and de&s;ires;</HI> for Chri&s;t him&s;elf declared, that <HI>"from the beginning it was not &s;o,"</HI> Matt. xix. 8, 9. and at the &s;ame time our Lord informed the Jews, that <Q>Mo&s;es, becau&s;e of <HI>the hardne&s;s of their hearts,</HI> &s;uffered them to put away their wives.</Q></P>
<P>NEITHER was it <HI>according to the law of na|ture,</HI> that the Jews were <HI>permitted</HI> in their be|haviour and dealings, to make a partial di&s;|tinction between their <HI>brethren</HI> of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and &s;trangers. This national partiality was not, indeed, either commanded or re|commended,
<PB N="20" REF="19">in their law&mdash;but it was clearly <HI>permitted</HI> or <HI>tolerated,</HI> and probably, for the &s;ame rea&s;on as the la&s;t mentioned in&s;tance&mdash;<Q>thou <HI>&s;halt not lend</HI> upon u&s;ury to <HI>thy bro|ther,</HI></Q> &amp;c.&mdash;<Q>unto <HI>a &s;tranger</HI> thou may&s;t <HI>lend upon u&s;ury,</HI></Q> &amp;c. Deut. xxiii. 19.&mdash;Again&mdash;<Q>of <HI>a foreigner</HI> thou <HI>may&s;t exact;</HI></Q> (that is, what&s;oever <HI>has been lent,</HI> as appears by the preceding ver&s;es) but that which is "thine, <HI>with thy brother,</HI> thine hand &s;hall relea&s;e," Deut. xv. 3.</P>
<P>Now all the&s;e laws were <Q><HI>contrary to the law of nature,</HI></Q> or <HI>"natural equity,"</HI> (whatever Mr. Thomp&s;on may think) and were certainly annulled, or rather <HI>&s;uper&s;eded,</HI> as it were, by the more perfect doctrines of <HI>univer&s;al benevolence</HI> taught by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who <Q><HI>came not to de&s;troy, but to fulfil the law.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN the law of Mo&s;es we al&s;o read, <Q>Thou &s;halt not avenge or bear grudge again&s;t <HI>the children of thy people, but thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI></Q> Leviticus xix. 18.</P>
<P>THE Jews, accordingly, thought them&s;elves &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified, if they confined this glo|rious perfection of charity, viz. <HI>the loving others as them&s;elves,</HI> to the per&s;ons mentioned in the &s;ame ver&s;e, viz. <Q><HI>the children of their own people;</HI></Q> for they had no idea that &s;o much love could po&s;&s;ibly be due to any other &s;ort of <HI>neighbours</HI> or <HI>brethren.</HI> But Chri&s;t taught them by the parable of <HI>the good Sama|ritan,</HI> that <HI>all &s;trangers whatever,</HI> even tho&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="20">who are declared enemies, (as were the Sama|ritans to the Jews) are to be e&s;teemed our <HI>neighbours</HI> or <HI>brethren,</HI> whenever they &s;tand in need of our charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>"THE Jewi&s;h in&s;titution," indeed, as Mr. Thomp&s;on remarks, <Q>permitted the u&s;e of <HI>Bond&s;ervants,</HI></Q> but did not permit the <HI>bondage of brethren:</HI> STRANGERS ONLY could be <HI>lawfully</HI> retained as <HI>Bondmen</HI>&mdash;<Q>of the heathen,</Q> (or, more agreeably to the Hebrew word,  <GAP DESC="blank">  <Q><HI>of the nations</HI>) that are round about you, of <HI>them</HI> &s;hall ye buy <HI>Bond</HI> men and <HI>Bond</HI> maids. Moreo|ver of the children of <HI>&s;trangers</HI> that do &s;o|journ among you, <HI>of them &s;hall ye buy,</HI></Q> &amp;c. &mdash;"<HI>They</HI> &s;hall be your <HI>Bondmen for-ever.</HI>" Levit. xxv. 39 to 46.</P>
<P>THIS was the law, I mu&s;t acknowledge, with re&s;pect to <HI>a &s;tranger</HI> that was <HI>purcha&s;ed;</HI> but with re&s;pect to <HI>a brother</HI> or Hebrew of the &s;eed of Abraham, it was far otherwi&s;e, as the &s;ame chapter te&s;tifies; (39th ver&s;e) for, <Q>If thy <HI>brother</HI> that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be <HI>&s;old</HI> unto thee, thou <HI>&s;halt not compel him to &s;erve as a Bond&s;ervant,</HI> but as a hired &s;ervant, and as a &s;ojourner, he &s;hall be with thee, and &s;hall &s;erve thee unto the year of jubilee, and <HI>then &s;hall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him,</HI></Q> &amp;c. This was the <HI>utmo&s;t &s;ervitude</HI> that a Hebrew could <HI>lawfully</HI> exact from any of his <HI>brethren</HI> of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, unle&s;s the &s;ervant en|tered <HI>voluntarily</HI> into a perpetual &s;ervitude:
<PB N="22" REF="21">and, let me add, that it is al&s;o, the very <HI>utmo&s;t &s;ervitude</HI> that can <HI>lawfully</HI> be admitted <HI>among chri&s;tians;</HI> becau&s;e we are bound as chri&s;tians to e&s;teem <HI>every man our brother,</HI> and <HI>our neighbour,</HI> which I have already prov|ed; &s;o that this con&s;equence, which I have drawn, is ab&s;olutely <HI>unavoidable.</HI> The Jews, indeed, who do not yet acknowledge the commands of Chri&s;t, may perhaps &s;till think them&s;elves <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> by the law of Mo&s;es, in making partial di&s;tinctions between <HI>their bre|thren</HI> of I&s;rael, <HI>and other men;</HI> but it would <HI>be inexcu&s;able</HI> in chri&s;tians to do &s;o, and therefore I conclude, that we certainly have no right to exceed the <HI>limits of &s;ervitude,</HI> which the Jews were bound to ob&s;erve, when|ever their poor <HI>brethren</HI> were &s;old to them: and I apprehend that we mu&s;t not venture <HI>even to go &s;o far,</HI> becau&s;e the laws of <HI>bro|therly love</HI> are infinitely enlarged, and ex|tended by the go&s;pel of peace, which pro|claims <HI>"good will towards men,"</HI> without di&s;tinction; and becau&s;e we cannot be &s;aid to <HI>"love our neighbours as our&s;elves;"</HI> or to <Q><HI>do to others as we would they &s;hould do unto us</HI></Q>&mdash;whil&s;t we retain them again&s;t their <HI>will,</HI> in a de&s;picable &s;ervitude as <HI>Slaves,</HI> and <HI>private property,</HI> or <HI>mere chattels.</HI></P>
<P>THE glorious &s;y&s;tem of the go&s;pel de&s;troys all <HI>narrow, national partiality;</HI> and makes <HI>us citizens of the world,</HI> by obliging us to profe&s;s <HI>univer&s;al benevolence:</HI> but more e&s;pecially are we bound, as chri&s;tians, to commi&s;erate and
<PB N="23" REF="22">a&s;&s;i&s;t to the utmo&s;t of our power all per&s;ons in <HI>di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> or <HI>captivity;</HI> whatever the <Q><HI>wor&s;hipful</HI> committee of the company of merchants trading to Africa,</Q> may think of it, or their advocate, the reverend Mr. Thomp&s;on.</P>
<P>CHARITY, indeed, begins at home; and we ought mo&s;t certainly to give the prefer|ence to our own countrymen, whenever we can do &s;o without inju&s;tice; but we may "<HI>not do evil that</HI> good may come;" (though our &s;tate&s;men, and their political deceivers may think otherwi&s;e) we mu&s;t not, for the &s;ake of <HI>Old-England,</HI> and its <HI>African Trade,</HI> or for the &s;uppo&s;ed advantage, or imaginary nece&s;&s;ities of our American colonies, lay a&s;ide our <HI>chri&s;tian charity,</HI> which we owe to <HI>all the re&s;t of mankind:</HI> becau&s;e, <HI>whenever we do &s;o,</HI> we certainly de&s;erve to be con&s;idered in no better light than as an overgrown <HI>&s;oci|ety of robbers,</HI> a <HI>mere banditti,</HI> who, perhaps, may <HI>love one another,</HI> but at the &s;ame time are at enmity with <HI>all the re&s;t of the world.</HI> Is this <HI>according to the law of nature?</HI>&mdash; For &s;hame Mr. Thomp&s;on!</P>
<P>I HAVE much more to communicate, but no more time to write:&mdash;if I had, I could draw from the &s;criptures the mo&s;t alarm|ing examples of God's &s;evere judgments up|on the Jews, for tyrannizing over <HI>their bre|thren,</HI> and, <HI>expre&s;sly,</HI> for exceeding the <HI>li|mits</HI> of <HI>&s;ervitude</HI> ju&s;t now mentioned. I mu&s;t find time however to adopt one ob&s;erva|tion
<PB N="24" REF="23">even from the reverend Mr. Thomp&s;on, (p. 11) viz. <Q>This &s;ubject will grow more &s;erious upon our hands, when we con&s;ider the <HI>buying and &s;elling Negroes,</HI></Q> not as a clande&s;tine or piratical bu&s;ine&s;s, but as an <Q><HI>open publick trade, encouraged</HI> and promoted by acts of parliament; for &s;o, if being <HI>contrary to religion, it mu&s;t be deemed a nati|onal &s;in;</HI> and as &s;uch may have a con&s;e|quence that <HI>would be always to be dreaded.</HI></Q> May God give us grace to repent of this abo|minable national oppre&s;&s;ion, before it is too ate!</P>
<P>If I have vindicated the law of Mo&s;es, much ea&s;ier can I vindicate the benevolent apo&s;tle Paul, from Mr. Thomp&s;on's in&s;inua|tions, with re&s;pect to Slavery; for he <HI>did not</HI> entreat <HI>Philemon</HI> to take back his &s;ervant One|&s;imus "in his former capacity," as Mr. Thomp&s;on has a&s;&s;erted, in order to render Bondage <Q><HI>con&s;i&s;tent with the principles of revealed religion,</HI></Q>&mdash;but St. Paul &s;aid <HI>ex|pre&s;sly,</HI> <Q><HI>not now as a &s;ervant, but, above a &s;ervant,</HI> a <HI>brother beloved,</HI></Q> &amp;c. So that Mr. Thomp&s;on has notoriou&s;ly wre&s;ted St. Paul's words.</P>
<P>IN the other texts where St. Paul re|commends &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Servants,</HI> for con|&s;cience-&s;ake, he at the &s;ame time enjoins the ma&s;ter to entertain &s;uch a mea&s;ure of <HI>brotherly love</HI> towards his Servants, as mu&s;t be entirely &s;ubver&s;ive of the African trade, and We&s;t-Indian Slavery. And though St.
<PB N="25" REF="24">Paul recommends chri&s;tian patience under &s;ervitude, yet, at the &s;ame time, he plainly in&s;inuates, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with chri&s;ti|anity, and the dignity of Chri&s;t's kingdom, that a <HI>chri&s;tian brother</HI> &s;hould be a <HI>Slave.</HI> "Can'&s;t thou be made free?" (&s;ays he to the chri&s;tian &s;ervants) <Q><HI>choo&s;e it rather,</HI> for he that is <HI>called</HI> of the Lord, <HI>being a &s;ervant,</HI> is the <HI>Freeman</HI> of the Lord; and, in like man|ner, he that is called, <HI>being free,</HI> is the <HI>&s;er|vant of Chri&s;t</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q><HI>Ye are bought with a price;</HI> BE NOT THEREFORE, THE SER|VANTS OF MEN.</Q> The apo&s;tle, indeed, had ju&s;t before recommended, to his di&s;ciples to <HI>abide in the &s;ame calling</HI> wherein they were called, and, <HI>"being &s;ervants, not to care for it:"</HI> That is, not to grieve on account of <HI>their temporal</HI> &s;tate; for he was unwilling to ad|vance any doctrine that might &s;eem to inter|fere with the <HI>temporal e&s;tabli&s;hments</HI> of govern|ment, and the &s;uppo&s;ed rights of men; yet it plainly appears, by the in&s;inuations, which immediately follow, that he thought it dero|gatory to the honour of chri&s;tianity, that men, <HI>who "are bought,"</HI> with the ine&s;timable <HI>price of Chri&s;t's blood,</HI> &s;hould be e&s;teemed <HI>&s;ervants;</HI> that is, <HI>the Slaves,</HI> and private pro|perty of other men; and had chri&s;tianity been e&s;tabli&s;hed by <HI>temporal</HI> authority, in tho&s;e countries where Paul preached, as it is at pre&s;ent in the&s;e kingdoms, we need not doubt but that he would have <HI>urged,</HI> nay, compelled the ma&s;ters, <HI>as he did Philemon,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="25">by the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing arguments, to treat their quondam Slaves, <Q>NOT NOW AS SERVANTS, BUT ABOVE SERVANTS&mdash; AS BRETHREN BELOVED.</Q></P>
