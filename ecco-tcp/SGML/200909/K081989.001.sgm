<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Letters, which I have herewith the Honour and Happine&s;s of
offer|ing to the Public, were to me the volun|tary Gift of an elegant Friend of
the late Mr. SHENSTONE; of a Friend, who, like my&s;elf, loved his private
Virtues, and ad|mired his literary Abilities; and if the Va|lue of &s;uch a
Gift could have received En|hancement, it was effectually derived from the
polite Manner wherein it was pre&s;ented. The following Extracts from &s;ome
Letters which accompanied them, will &s;hew on what unre&s;erved Stipulations I
received them, and con&s;equently will (I hope) ju&s;|tify the U&s;e I make of
them. 
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract the fir&s;t, from a Letter dated 
<DATE>Nov. 9, 1775.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I herewith perform my Promi&s;e; as I found the Letters in my
Bureau, &s;o I <PB N="ii" REF="4"> &s;end them to you, having neither Time nor
Spirits to look them over. They are now your own, with full Permi&s;&s;ion to
apply them to any Purpo&s;e you think proper. I &s;hall be glad if they
an&s;wer your Expectation. As <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them are tho&s;e of a Friend
&s;o highly valued, they will, with <HI>you,</HI> I know, have Merit, and, I
hope, with the <HI>World.</HI> Of the latter, however, you are the be&s;t
Judge, and to your Deci&s;ion I implicitly tru&s;t them. I wi&s;h I could add
much more&mdash;the little I can, I will. PINDAR's Odes, VER|NON's Poems, (with
Ob&s;ervations by Mr. SHENSTONE) and the <HI>Gentle Shep|herd,</HI> were
<HI>all his,</HI> and as &s;uch I hope you will accept them, in Remembrance of
him. Be&s;ides the Letters which are tied up, the Parcel will contain Remarks
on MILTON's <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> Copies of the Duche&s;s of SOMERSET's
Letters, (tran&s;cribed by Mr. SHENSTONE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> The&s;e
particular Letters (I &s;hould pre&s;ume) will unque&s;tionably be allowed to
de&s;erve the Character which Mr. SHENSTONE has prefixed to them in his
Tran&s;cript. It is as follows: 
<Q>Copies of Letters from her Grace the Duche&s;s Dowager of
SOMERSET (formerly Counte&s;s of <HI>Hertford)</HI> in which is di&s;cernible a
perfect Rectitude of Heart, Delicacy of Sentiment, and a truly-cla&s;&s;ic
Ea&s;e and Elegance of Style. There are many of them tinged with an Air of
Melancholy, thro' the Lo&s;s of her only Son, Lord BEAUCHAMP.</Q></NOTE>) and 
<PB N="iii" REF="5"> bound in Vellum, three loo&s;e in the Leaves, (her Grace's
own Hand-Wri|ting) the <HI>Scotch</HI> Fragments, and a little Memorandum-Book,
over which, per|haps, you will like to &s;pend Half an Hour, though it contains
nothing but <HI>Names.</HI></P>
</LETTER> Again, in a Letter, dated <HI>April</HI> 4, 1776. 
<LETTER>
<P>Have you &s;een, or heard from Mr. &mdash;? Have you yet got,
or are you like|ly to get, that Letter of the Duche&s;s of SOMERSET's which was
mi&s;&s;ing? I hope &s;o&mdash;May Succe&s;s attend you! When the whole is
dige&s;ted and revi&s;ed, I have no Doubt of its being valuable.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This explicit Di&s;clo&s;ure of the liberal Means, by which
the&s;e Letters came into <PB N="iv" REF="6"> my Hands, will, I pre&s;ume,
confirm the Authenticity of them, if they can be &s;up|po&s;ed to &s;tand in
Need of &s;uch Confirma|tion; I &s;ay, <HI>if they can,</HI> for &s;urely they
po&s;&s;e&s;s indubitable Marks of Originality, and require no adventitious
Evidence to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>Being thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch an unlimited Power, my
fir&s;t Care was to make the mo&s;t cautious and delicate U&s;e of it. I have
ac|cordingly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all entire Letters, as well as di&s;tinct
Pa&s;&s;ages, which appeared to contain Matter improper for public
In&s;pec|tion; all, in Fact, which might be liable (in the &s;lighte&s;t
Degree) to Mi&s;con&s;truction, either relative to the Writer, or the Party
addre&s;&s;ed, or that might awaken unwelcome Feelings in the Brea&s;t of any
&s;urviving Friend or Relation. I have likewi&s;e, where a Corre&s;pondent is
introduced, or other Per|&s;on alluded to, who may be &s;till alive, (tho'
mo&s;t of the Corre&s;pondents, I am convinced, are dead) I have, I &s;ay, on
&s;uch Occa&s;ions, pre&s;erved only Initials of the Names, in order that
public Curio&s;ity &s;hould be no <PB N="v" REF="7"> further gratified than
might be agreeable to the Parties concerned.</P>
<P>After what I have advanced to prove the nice Precaution I have
taken, does this plea&s;ing, and, at the &s;ame Time, u&s;eful Undertaking of
mine &s;tand in Need of an Apology?&mdash;I hope not.&mdash;I flatter my&s;elf,
the very Per&s;ons, to who&s;e Situations I have alluded in the foregoing
Paragraph, will confe&s;s, it does not. Not to &s;ay a Word of my own
Principles, I affirm that the bare Idea of a Publication, wherein Mr.
SHENSTONE's Talents are di&s;played, or wherein even his Name is mentioned,
would deter me from advancing one Step beyond the Bounds of Propriety and
Decorum.</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding all I have &s;aid in Self-Ju&s;tification,
I know there are &s;ome very peculiar (if I dared, I would call them
<HI>over-nice)</HI> Per&s;ons, who alledge, that no private Letters &s;hould be
made public, with|out the Con&s;ent of the Writers of &s;uch Let|ters. This I
will readily allow to be a good <HI>general</HI> Rule, but, like many others,
may <PB N="vi" REF="8"> admit of an Exception, in particular In|&s;tances; and
the&s;e In&s;tances are, where a <HI>proper Mode</HI> of introducing them to
the World is inviolably attended to. It is a well-known, and equally
uncontrovertible, Maxim, that Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Ex|cellence
(e&s;pecially in the literary Walk) are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t
Re&s;erve and Diffidence. Were the private Sentiments of &s;uch to be with-held
from the Public, till their individual Con&s;ent were obtained, what a Lo&s;s
would it be to the Republic of Letters, and what an Injury to moral
Im|provement! Any Per&s;on's general Princi|ples and Ideas may be &s;een,
perhaps, in the re&s;pective public Profe&s;&s;ion and Situation of Life, and
their general Intercour&s;e with Mankind; but the innate Sen&s;ations, the more
refined Emanations of the Mind, are alone di&s;coverable in the private
Com|munications of Friend&s;hip. There can therefore be no unpardonable Liberty
in <HI>de|coying,</HI> or even <HI>gently-compelling</HI> &s;uch De|&s;ervers
into public Notice; nor is it, by any Means, uncharitable to &s;uppo&s;e, there
may be many, who would not be violently di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee their
Sentiments in Print, <PB N="vii" REF="9"> however reluctant they might, and,
per|haps, ought to appear, if their particular Permi&s;&s;ion were applied
for.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate and enforce this Po&s;ition, let me be permitted
to a&s;k, if the Duche&s;s of SOMERSET had been reque&s;ted to have &s;uf|fered
her Letters to be made public, whe|ther &s;he would have con&s;ented? Probably
not&mdash;Yet what an Advocate would moral Virtue, pious Re&s;ignation, and
genuine Piety have been deprived of, if tho&s;e exqui|&s;ite Tran&s;cripts of
her Mind had been con|cealed from public View!&mdash;It is, moreover, Matter of
great Doubt, whether we &s;hould have been &s;o well acquainted with the
Ta|lents of a SHENSTONE, had Providence in|dulged the Wi&s;hes of his mo&s;t
intimate Friends and Acquaintances, in prolonging &s;o valuable a Life.</P>
<P>Thus it has been, is, and will be, with mo&s;t People of
di&s;tingui&s;hed Abilities; their Excellencies mu&s;t, in a Manner, be
<HI>forced</HI> into Day-light, or we &s;hould lo&s;e the Bene|fit of their
Precepts; they might otherwi&s;e be &s;aid, like Mi&s;ers, to have a valuable
Trea|&s;ure <PB N="viii" REF="10"> buried with them, which ought, in common
Ju&s;tice, to be left behind for the Advantage of Survivors.</P>
<P>I have, I doubt, been too prolix; but the Fear of offending, or,
at lea&s;t, a De&s;ire to wipe off the Stain of &s;uch an <HI>Intention,</HI>
has led me into it. I hope, I &s;tand excul|pated; and now beg only to
conclude, with &s;incere Thanks to the Gentleman, who po|litely obliged me with
Letter XXVII. of the Duche&s;s of SOMERSET's, and my mo&s;t grate|ful
Acknowledgements to the fir&s;t men|tioned Friend, who conferred on me the
ele|gant Plea&s;ure of conveying to the Public &s;ome few more Excellencies of
that benevo|lent Man who&s;e living Talents I admired, and who&s;e Memory I
revere.</P>

<TAILNOTE>
<P>&dtristar;The accurate Reader will di&s;cover &s;ome Letters
erroneou&s;ly placed in Point of Date, owing principally to &s;ome Copies not
being received early enough for their proper Situations; but as no Chain of
Events is inter|rupted thereby, it is hoped the Error may ea&s;ily be
ex|cu&s;ed.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Oct. 19, 1736.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry to put you to an Expence for a trifling Letter at this
Di&s;tance. It &s;eems too, to give you leave to expect &s;ome|thing
extraordinary, or uncommon. Whatever is &s;o in my Letters, I am &s;ure, mu&s;t
be on the bad Side. I may however have the greater Power to convince you, that
Di&s;tance is in|capable to &s;eparate you from my Thoughts.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="20">I am, at pre&s;ent, in a very refined State of
Indolence and Inactivity. Indeed I make little more U&s;e of a Country Life,
than to live over again the Plea&s;ures of <HI>Oxford</HI> and your Com|pany.
You might convey me a Letter full, would you be &s;o exceedingly good as your
Promi&s;e. I am va&s;tly &s;elf-intere&s;ted, for I write only in order to beg
a Letter from you, with very &s;mall Hopes of your receiving much Plea|&s;ure
from mine.</P>
<P>I &s;hould here give you an Account of the Plea&s;ures we have had
at M&mdash;, but my Paper won't contain it. There was one only wanting,
<HI>pour le comble</HI>&mdash;you'll be the la&s;t to find it out&mdash;your
Company. I aim at render|ing my Letters as odd and fanta&s;tical as
po&s;&s;i|ble; but when I write to a Per&s;on of your elegant character, my
Compliments degenerate into downright Truths, ju&s;t (I was going to &s;ay) as
the Sun turns bad Wine to Vinegar; but downright Truths are &s;ometimes
valuable, though a Per&s;on of your Ta&s;te might rea&s;on|ably expect more
refined&mdash;at lea&s;t le&s;s obvious ones. Sometimes, however, Vinegar has
al&s;o <PB N="3" REF="21"> its U&s;e, though to treat a Gentleman with it
entirely may well create a <HI>Nau&s;ea.</HI> I fancy my poignant Simile grows
&s;tale by this Time. I write to an Intimate, and a Man of Sen&s;e, who&s;e
Good-nature will forgive what his Judg|ment may find fault with.</P>
<P>I hope your Ring gives you all imagina|ble Happine&s;s, however
fatal it may prove to female Ken. I &s;u&s;pect to hear of you as the fine&s;t
Performer on the Spinnet in the World. Were I a Poet, I &s;hould be highly
plea&s;ed to celebrate the admirable Conduct of your little Finger&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Tui Pollicis Ictum,</HI>"</Q> &s;ays
<HI>Ho|race</HI>; vile Pedant that I am! who &s;hall deli|ver me from the

<P>I heard at <HI>Oxford</HI> of the Addition of the Side-Diamonds; I
gue&s;&s;ed, le&s;t the Splendour &s;hould be extingui&s;hed by a greater,
<HI>o&ugrave; vous &s;&ccedil;avez.</HI> I want to &s;ee you exceedingly; you
are, I a&s;&s;ure you, a va&s;t Part of my Plea&s;ure at <HI>Oxford,</HI> as
POPE is in the Country; indeed, you might &s;hare that Effect with Mr. POPE,
would you write. It is a Favour, for which I mu&s;t grow importunate;
notwith&s;tanding <PB N="4" REF="22"> which, the Favours I have already
received, would make me unea&s;y, were I not con&s;cious who be&s;tows
them.</P>
<P>Of all the moral Virtues, Gratitude is &s;ure the mo&s;t beautiful;
&s;o far from betraying any Thing mean or ignoble in her Behaviour, &s;he has
an Air which naturally di&s;covers her Qua|lity.&mdash;I can't &s;tay to

<P>I HAVE &s;ent the Patterns, though with far le&s;s Expedition than
you might expect from one &s;o entirely yours. The truth is, I was &s;en&s;ible
how in&s;upportable the Tran&s;ition mu&s;t be from your Company to none at
all, &s;o contrived to pay &s;everal Vi&s;its immediately after I had left
M&mdash;. You'll gue&s;s how &s;uffi|cient a Mortification I found even thus.
To pa&s;s from yours to the Company of dull Aunts and Cou&s;ins mu&s;t needs
prove tedious, as the Rever&s;e would be agreeable.</P>
<P>As to the Draughts, I am &s;atisfied in what a ridiculous Light they
mu&s;t appear; it was a Ta&s;k I was very much unu&s;ed to, and &s;olicited
rather out of an officious Fondne&s;s to be em|ployed for you, than any Skill I
was con&s;cious of in my&s;elf. I mu&s;t beg Mr. G&mdash;'s Pardon for engaging
in a Work, wherein he is far <PB N="6" REF="24"> my Superior. Such as they are,
I beg you would believe they are the be&s;t I am capable of. I would rather
have my Judgment than Care cen&s;ured, in any Thing I am employed in for you.
You'll be &s;urprized to find them joined with a Paper &s;crawl'd over with
dull Poetry: however, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, as I wrote it to plea&s;e my&s;elf, I
&s;ent it, not without Hopes that it might, in an inferior Manner, plea&s;e
you. One may &s;ometimes amu&s;e one's-&s;elf with what one can't entirely
approve. As I can't flatter my&s;elf, your Judgment can excu&s;e, &s;o I can't
apprehend your Good-nature will ex|po&s;e me. To vindicate my Character to you,
as a Poet, I &s;hall only join the&s;e alleviating Circum&s;tances; Fir&s;t,
that nothing makes &s;o aukward a Figure in Ver&s;e (as well as in &s;ome other
Re&s;pects) as Sincerity. Secondly, that the&s;e Lines were wrote when I had no
great Flow of Spirits, namely, when I had ju&s;t left M&mdash;, and you; but I
&s;hall want your Patience el&s;ewhere, &s;o will &s;ay no more about
'em&mdash;only this&mdash;that I &s;hould not have mentioned Mi&s;s L&mdash;,
were I not per&s;uaded that, as you are entirely free from the other Faults of
your <PB N="7" REF="25"> Sex, &s;o you are from that of not bearing to hear
another commended. It is a Sign of a great Want of Accompli&s;hments, when a
Per|&s;on is continually &s;u&s;picious of being rivalled; and, for that Part,
you may give every One many more than their Due, without the lea&s;t Danger of
being &s;o.</P>
<P>I could not help envying WHISTLER's Hap|pine&s;s, when I came away;
I fancy your Lives have been a con&s;tant Round of Delights; I don't know any
Neighbourhood more likely to produce 'em. I could reconcile my&s;elf, how|ever,
pretty well to <HI>Harborough</HI>'s melancholy Scenes, were I not con&s;cious
of &s;uch &s;uperior Plea&s;ures, <HI>o&ugrave; vous &s;&ccedil;avez.</HI> You
might convey me a Letter full of them, but you'll, perhaps, think it an
impertinent Reque&s;t. I could &s;et what Value you plea&s;e on the Favour,
though the Plea&s;ure I can't pretend to limit.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now break off my Letter in as auk|wark a Manner as I take
my Leave, which is likewi&s;e u&s;ually mo&s;t aukward, where I have mo&s;t
Re&s;pect. I'll e'en lay a&s;ide further Cere|mony <PB N="8" REF="26"> in this,

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU expre&s;s &s;o great a Concern for my Brother's Illne&s;s, that
not only common Civility, but Humanity, obliges me to acquaint you, that he is
upon the Recovery. His Phy|&s;icians have thought him out of Danger the&s;e
three Weeks, as to his Fever, but are appre|hen&s;ive of a Con&s;umption; to
prevent which, they have ordered him a Milk-Diet, as &s;oon as 
<PB N="9" REF="27"> he gets into the Country, which he hopes to do, &s;ome Time
next Week. My Brother G&mdash; is with him. To make the Journey ea&s;y, they
propo&s;e to hire a Chai&s;e, and make three or four Days of it.</P>
<P>DICK has been &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate to write to me twice; the
Fir&s;t was only to &s;hew me he was alive; in the la&s;t Letter he &s;eems to
have recovered his u&s;ual Spirits, and &s;ays, he mu&s;t be obliged to the
mo&s;t de&s;picable Creature in the Univer&s;e for the mo&s;t valuable
Ble&s;&s;ing in Life. He is quite determined to leave the Study of Phy&s;ick,
and turn Friar, which I am delighted at, as I believe it will be conducive to
his Health.</P>
<P>I think I have been very particular in my Account of my Brother,
which you would have received la&s;t Po&s;t, but that I was from Home when
yours came, and did not return till late on Saturday Night. I write this in the
greate&s;t Hurry, for Company waits for me to &s;et out for S&mdash;: but I
mu&s;t tell you, that I am very angry you &s;hould think &s;o meanly of me, as
to imagine I had not Genero&s;ity enough to <PB N="10" REF="28"> &s;end you an

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with Gra|titude, as well as
Good-manners, not to return you Thanks for the Plea&s;ures your Wri|tings have
given me; but I &s;hall de&s;i&s;t from <PB N="11" REF="29"> declaring my
Sentiments of them, le&s;t you &s;hould &s;tile it Flattery. Writing has been
my con&s;tant Employ (when at Home) ever &s;ince you left us, and I hope you
could not expect them &s;ooner. I could not but think Fate doubly cruel, (when
to part us was as much as we <HI>here</HI> could bear with Decency) to embroil
us &s;till more by the Hurt of the Leg, which I am glad to hear is got
well.</P>
<P>With you fled all Life and Spirit from A&mdash;; a total Eclip&s;e
&s;ucceeded you, and the Sun will &s;hine no more till your <HI>bright
Influence</HI> di&s;pels the Cloud. Company and Fruit come in of|ten, but all
in vain, for nothing has any Re|li&s;h, but the Writings of him who cau&s;ed
the Malady. You have &s;hone &s;o much to the Prejudice of our Neighbours, that
it is with Difficulty we behave with tolerable Decorum. We drink your Health as
con&s;tant as Appetite (or rather, Cu&s;tom) calls to Table, for nothing has
any Ta&s;te, except the Gla&s;s, in which you are named.</P>
<P>We &s;ent <HI>Tom Thumb</HI>'s Performance (I think in my Heart it
is Non&s;en&s;en&s;e) to Mr. &mdash;, who <PB N="12" REF="30"> read it, called
him <HI>na&s;ty Dog,</HI> and put it in his Pocket. Whether it will be a
Spit-Cat, or dumb Madne&s;s, I don't know; but I am &s;ure the bottled
Small-Beer was very bri&s;k la&s;t <HI>Sunday.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 25th we date our Mi&s;ery; no Smile &s;een,
or Laugh heard &s;ince, till la&s;t Night.&mdash;What could cau&s;e one
then?&mdash;Why, Mr. SHENSTONE, who had been dumb &s;o long, &s;poke then, and
who can hear him without being plea&s;ed? It is meet and right, as well as
highly plea&s;ing to Mrs. MARY, that you &s;hould re&s;pect Mr. A&mdash;, who,
I believe, in|tends to &s;pend his la&s;t Breath in your Prai&s;e, but he'll
make your Name glorious. Nothing could give him more Plea&s;ure than you have
done, except a Pre&s;ent of Lawn-Sleeves. As to the Scheme you mention, I dare
not bid you hope, but I will venture to bid you not de|&s;pair, on a
Pre&s;umption that your Rhetorick can never fail of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>I can't prevail with my Si&s;ters for a Letter a-piece. One &s;ays,
that you &s;hall be the next Gentleman &s;he writes to. Mrs. A&mdash; &s;ays,
tho' <PB N="13" REF="31"> you cut off your Hair, &s;he believes your Ears will
remain, and wi&s;hes nothing &s;o much as an Opportunity to pinch 'em. Mi&s;s
K&mdash; &s;ays, &s;he has already &s;uffered too much by <HI>that Ty|rant,
Love,</HI> ever to engage with Mankind more, not even Mr. SHENSTONE; but cannot
bear that Mi&s;s D&mdash; &s;hould be &s;o happy. S&mdash; &s;ays, &s;he would
make a hand&s;ome Speech, but cannot, and therefore &s;ends you <HI>only
Service.</HI> My Brother de&s;ires his Compliments, and &s;ays, he can't fix a
Time for &s;eeing <HI>the Lea&s;owes,</HI> but de&s;igns to be at

Sayings of the A&mdash;ians.</HI> But I have not done yet, till I have been a
little more trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>Note. If I did not know you to be a good Judge of Mankind, and had
not experienced your Good-nature, (which inclines you to ex|cu&s;e the Foibles
of the <HI>weaker Ve&s;&s;el)</HI> together with the Hopes, that, for the Sake
of &s;ome happy Favourite, you would not expo&s;e the Sex, I &s;hould not have

<SALUTE>Dear Mi&s;s F&mdash;,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON a Time, as 'tis reported, the Moun|tains were in Labour; when,
after a long Cour&s;e of Pains and Inquietudes, they made a &s;hift to produce
that puny Animal, a Mou&s;e. <PB N="15" REF="33"> Now that very individual
Mou&s;e, according to the my&s;terious and figurative Import of Types and
Shadows, was the perfect Image and Re|pre&s;entative of this mine Epi&s;tle. A
groveling, &s;tarveling, in&s;ignificant Production, conceived with much
Difficulty, and tran&s;mitted to you with Confu&s;ion of Face. In &s;hort, you
may look upon it as the noble Booty you have taken, by baiting your
<HI>Trap</HI> &s;o artfully with Prai&s;e and Compliment, about two or three
Months ago. True it is, that, con&s;idering the Politene&s;s and Complai&s;ance
of your obliging Letter, my Behaviour &s;ince mu&s;t appear the mo&s;t
<HI>unknightly</HI> of all Proceedings, But your Packet did not arrive till
three Weeks after it was &s;ent; &s;o you will excu&s;e my Silence till the Day
after I received it, and whatever was <HI>more</HI> than that, I freely
acknowledge, came of Sin. However, you will, upon Confe&s;&s;ion, par|don me,
as you expect Pardon from your Con|fe&s;&s;or, &s;hould the Benedictines and
Friars get a Footing in this I&s;land, which I find your Brother is
endeavouring to prevent.</P>
<P>I can be no longer ludicrous on this la&s;t Article. I am too
&s;eriou&s;ly concerned for his <PB N="16" REF="34"> Safety; yet I don't fear
but the Rebels will be defeated, and, it may be, all Danger over in le&s;s than
a Fortnight. But General WADE's Behaviour, loitering &s;o long at
<HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> a&s;to|ni&s;hes me. I was at <HI>Birmingham</HI> on
<HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Morning, from whence I &s;aw the Remains of LIGONIER's
Hor&s;e march with va&s;t Spirits and Alacrity. They wi&s;h to have, what they
call, the <HI>Refu&s;al</HI> of the <HI>Highlanders.</HI> They are Men of
experienced Bravery, and fought like Furies at the Battle of <HI>Fontenoy.</HI>
May they do &s;o now, and with better Succe&s;s!</P>
<P>B&mdash; told me, your Brother would borrow my Pi&s;tols. At that
Time, &s;uppo&s;ing him in Je&s;t, I &s;ent him no very &s;erious An&s;wer. I
now think it incumbent on me to &s;ay, that I would lend them him with all my
Heart, but that one of them is broke in the Stock, and cannot be fired with
Safety till it is &s;tocked afre&s;h. Perhaps he might recollect it was &s;o
when I was at A&mdash;.</P>
<P>We have been be&s;t Part of a Week at <HI>Litchfield,</HI> where we
lived like Chickens in a Pen, confined and crammed, and where we 
<PB N="17" REF="35"> &s;erved God after the Manner of Popes and
Cardinals.&mdash;I only allude to Cathedral Service. Mr. and Mrs. D&mdash;
&s;eemed quite di&s;po&s;ed to entertain us agreeably. The Son and Daugh|ter,
to &s;ay the lea&s;t, appeared much more indifferent in that Particular. 
<Q REND="inline">"The&s;e,"</Q> as SHAKESPEARE &s;ays, 
<Q REND="inline">"are certainly better Chri&s;tians, or el&s;e, are
wor&s;e than we."</Q></P>
<P>You have e&s;caped me at <HI>Birmingham,</HI> by concealing the Time
of your Vi&s;it. Surely, you will come over to <HI>Broom,</HI> ere it be long,
and give me my Revenge.</P>
<P>Tell Mrs. A&mdash;, my Ears make great Shoots, and &s;uch as may
tempt her Hand egregiou&s;ly: but if I <HI>am</HI> metamorpho&s;ed into an
A&s;s entirely, I will come and &s;erenade her in a Morning, when &s;he has
been up late the Night before.</P>
<P>I beg my Compliments to all Friends. I mu&s;t not make my Letter
much longer&mdash;the Mou&s;e will el&s;e grow to the Size of a Rat. I beg you
to accept this idle Billet in Part of an An&s;wer to your elegant Letter, and

authorize or qualify me to write to Poets and Men of Letters. Upon &s;trict
Enquiry, I am &s;en&s;ible, that nothing I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, can entitle
me to it, and no|thing but Vanity and Selfi&s;hne&s;s could &s;pur 
<PB N="19" REF="37"> me on to this Impertinence; Vanity, in being addre&s;&s;ed
by a Man of your Capacity and Fi|gure in the World, and Selfi&s;hne&s;s, as I
am &s;ure to be a Gainer by your Corre&s;pondence. I mu&s;t, however, tell you,
the Epithets of art|ful, polite, and witty, I have no Right to. In the&s;e
Re&s;pects, I am an Heroine of your own making, but I attribute all this to the
Con|&s;equence of that great and generous Mind of your own, and in who&s;e
Nature it is to ima|gine you &s;ee in others what you really po&s;&s;e&s;s
your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble you with a Detail of the Frights, Fears, and
dreadful Apprehen&s;ions, almo&s;t every body has been under, concerning the
Devil, the Pope, and the Pretender; 'tis my good Fortune to have more of that
&s;trength|ening Ingredient, called Hope, than that of the de&s;tructive one,
called Fear, in my Compo&s;i|tion, which has prevented my &s;uffering &s;o much
upon the Occa&s;ion, as the re&s;t of my Neigh|bours. For my own Part, I had
but one Fear, which was that of my Brother's march|ing; but I was &s;oon made
ea&s;y in that Parti|cular, <PB N="20" REF="38"> when I found the
<HI>Duke</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Duke of CUMBERLAND, &s;econd Son to King
GEORGE the Second, who headed the Forces again&s;t the Rebels.</NOTE> had no
Occa|&s;ion for, nor would accept of, the new-rai&s;ed Regiments. All the
neighbouring Gentlemen, who had not Commi&s;&s;ions, went Volunteers in Captain
WHITMORE's Company, but are all come Home again, and begin to think they have
been upon a Don QUIXOTE Expedition, or have done like the King of
<HI>France,</HI> and his Forty-thou&s;and.</P>
<P>All the Females are turned Politicians, except my&s;elf. I
be&s;towed two Minutes and an half in con&s;idering whether I &s;hould affect
to appear one or not. In the fir&s;t Minute, my Thoughts &s;ugge&s;ted to me,
that there never would be a Parliament of Women; in the &s;econd, I was
convinced, if that &s;hould happen, it was mo|rally impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould
ever have a Seat in the Hou&s;e; and the la&s;t Half-minute confirmed me in my
Re&s;olution, not to meddle with Po|litics, which, I imagine, was never
de&s;igned a Province for Women. I &s;hall therefore be content till they act
in their proper Sphere, <PB N="21" REF="39"> and Ribbons, and Fans, (which are
better adapted to my Capacity) are again their Theme.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I &s;ay, as to neighbouring Oc|currences? Your Friend,
Mr. A&mdash;, is very well, and often talks of you. He told me, la&s;t Time I
was in his Company, he de&s;igned him|&s;elf the Plea&s;ure of calling on you
in his Way to <HI>B&mdash;,</HI> early in the Spring. Meeting with
<HI>bright</HI> B&mdash; the other Day, I de&s;ired him to &s;tir up his
Mu&s;e, to <HI>whip</HI> her, and <HI>la&s;h</HI> her, and put forth
&s;omething upon the Times. A Gen|tleman, who &s;at by, replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"Perhaps he may ruin him&s;elf in Whip-cord, before
he rou&s;es her."</Q> The <HI>Brobdignags</HI> go on with their Knotting, as
u&s;ual; but I don't find that your <HI>favourite</HI> Mi&s;s D&mdash;
de&s;igns you any for a Wai&s;tcoat.</P>
<P>It was not in my Power to give you more Notice of my Vi&s;it to
<HI>Birmingham</HI> than I did, as the Time was not fixed above &s;ix Days
be|fore I &s;et out, in which Time my Brother went to <HI>B&mdash;,</HI> and
de&s;ired Mr. D&mdash; to let you know, when he &s;aw you, (which he &s;aid
would be in a Day or two) you would think you had <PB N="22" REF="40"> Revenge
enough, if you knew how I was di&s;|appointed. At la&s;t, <HI>I &s;ighed within
my&s;elf,</HI> and &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"Surely, the Favour is more than I can
merit."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall now <HI>cry aloud,</HI> and &s;ay, <HI>Wo unto them</HI>
that forget their Promi&s;e, for therein is their Fidelity called in
Que&s;tion!&mdash;<HI>Wo unto them</HI> that era&s;e out of their Letters what
they had written, for thereby they injure the Brain of <HI>her</HI> that would
find it out!&mdash;<HI>Wo unto them</HI> that are three Months in an&s;wering a
Letter, for &s;urely it mu&s;t tire the Patience of <HI>her,</HI> who is, all
that Time, in Expectation!&mdash;<HI>Woful Truths!</HI></P>
<P>S&mdash; <HI>the Valiant</HI> de&s;ires his Compliments, and thanks
you for the Offer of your Pi&s;tols, which Favour he never a&s;ked, as he did
not imagine they &s;hould fight with Pi&s;tols. He has been at Home this Month
recruiting. I don't doubt but the <HI>Shrop&s;hire Fu&s;ileers</HI> will make a
great Figure in military Hi&s;tory&mdash;at lea&s;t, in the <HI>Prints.</HI>
The tender, the wild, the grave, and the mild, all lump their Compli|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="41">By the Time you come to this Place, (which,
without a double Share of Patience, you will never arrive at) you mu&s;t be
greatly di&s;ap|pointed, as you'll then find the Sum Total of all I have &s;aid
amounts to Nothing: but don't then blame Nature, Education, or the Stars that
pre&s;ided at my Birth, that I'm not a No|veli&s;t, nor capable of &s;aying any
Thing that can po&s;&s;ibly entertain you herein, but <HI>rather</HI> blame
your own wrong Choice in a Corre&s;pon|dent. I will now, out of Compa&s;&s;ion

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>A&mdash;,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>March</HI> 19, 1745-6.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT can't po&s;&s;ibly be otherwi&s;e, than that I &s;hall &s;oon
arrive at the Pinnacle of the Tem|ple of Vanity, in full Per&s;ua&s;ion of the
ju&s;t and de&s;erved Encomiums on my Letters. In the Name of all that's
&s;incere and hone&s;t, let me prevail with you to leave off Flattery, and act
the Plain-Dealer; and let it &s;uffice, when I tell you, that the grand
Compliment of all is, that you think my Letters worthy an An|&s;wer, which
alone is &s;ufficient to feed my Vanity.</P>
<P>Now, le&s;t you &s;hould not immediately re|collect the fatal
Con&s;equences, that may attend Flattery, from a Per&s;on one may chance to
have a good Opinion of, imagine that you &s;ee me intoxicated to the greate&s;t
Degree that weak Woman is capable of; in order to which, <PB N="25" REF="43">
you are to &s;uppo&s;e that I have taken it into my Head, that the Hou&s;e I
live in, is not em|belli&s;hed with Ornaments and Decorations fit for me to
inhabit; that the Meat I eat is too coar&s;e for my delicate Con&s;titution,
and Orto|lans alone fit for my Palate; that the Conver|&s;ation of my own
Family is quite de&s;picable; my Neighbours not worth my Notice; that the Air
is not pure enough for me to breathe; in fine, that I am a <HI>cele&s;tial
Creature,</HI> far &s;u|perior to the Race of Mortals on Earth. And, &s;hould
this happen, you mu&s;t then &s;mite your Brea&s;t, and &s;ay, 
<Q REND="inline">"Alas! the&s;e are the Effects of
Flattery!&mdash;Which &s;hall deter me from the Practice of it upon Womankind
for the future."</Q> I know 'tis a received Maxim with mo&s;t Men, that no
Woman can be plea&s;ed without Flattery; but why might there not be an
Exception to this Rule? If my Letters are polite, 'tis what I never de&s;igned;
nor do I think you could po&s;&s;ibly expect they &s;hould be &s;o, from a
little Garret, in a Corner of a Hou&s;e, in a Corner of the World; and from one
who has nothing more to boa&s;t of, than the common Gifts of Nature, without
any other <PB N="26" REF="44"> A&s;&s;i&s;tance than what proceeds from her
Hand|maid <HI>Time.</HI></P>
<P>As to your Di&s;pute with Mr. B&mdash;, 'tis &s;o like that between
the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> that I fancy it won't be determined
&s;oon. For my own Part, tho' the Fighters have done little, I am inclined to
think the Writers have done le&s;s; for, as yet, I have not &s;een one Line in
the poetical Way, but what a B&mdash; may rival; and as to hi&s;torical Facts,
I think they hang much upon Uncertainties. As it probably will be demanded of
every true Engli&s;hman, what he has done in Defence, or to the Honour of his
Country, I would fain know, if you are provided with an hundred Pages to throw
in the Teeth of any one who &s;hall a&s;k you the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>We are going to have &s;ome new Neighbours at <HI>W&mdash;d</HI>;
they are Si&s;ters in Law to old Mrs. D&mdash;T; perhaps, as compleat a Pair of
old Maids as <HI>England</HI> can produce. The younge&s;t is pa&s;t Sixty, and
yet the Lungs of of the elde&s;t are &s;o good, that I'll be an&s;wer|able
&s;he &s;hall harangue ten Hours together, <PB N="27" REF="45"> upon the
Subject of Matrimony. She will &s;carce allow St. PAUL in the Right, when he
&s;ays, 
<Q REND="inline">"They that marry do well;"</Q> but is thoroughly
per&s;uaded of the Truth of his next A&s;&s;ertion, 
<Q REND="inline">"They which don't marry do bet|ter."</Q> The
younge&s;t is not &s;o fluent with her Tongue, but &s;he, like the Welchman's
Owl, <HI>pays it off with thinking.</HI> I fancy we &s;hall be able, in a
little Time, to furni&s;h out a con&s;ider|able Society of old Maids, whereof
Mrs. L&mdash; (which is the Name of one of the above-men|tioned Ladies) &s;hall
be Lady-Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The <HI>Amazonian Mrs.</HI> A&mdash; will not own that &s;he envies
Mrs. M&mdash;; but I have a great Su&s;|picion, that &s;he intends to rival
JENNY CAME|RON, being equally fond of Wi&s;dom, to which I may add, &s;ome
Ambition to out-&s;hine her in the Field. She has practi&s;ed frequently on one
or other of the Family this Winter, by which Means it has been my Fate, more
than once, to lye in Honour's Truckle-bed. I believe &s;he de&s;igns to do
great Feats in War this Spring.</P>
<P>I am va&s;tly plea&s;ed with the Conver&s;ation of your Tenants, and
laughed immoderately <PB N="28" REF="46"> when I came to JOHN W&mdash;R's
Wittici&s;m. I don't intend to appear in Print, till I am well a&s;&s;ured I
&s;hall rival Mrs. &mdash; <HI>(A. P.)</HI> with her COPE, WADE, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. PITT has re&s;igned his Po&s;t in the Army, and recommended one
of his Nephews in his Room; not Mr. B&mdash;, I believe, for I don't hear that
he intends <HI>to boil his Lob&s;ter.</HI>&mdash;I love a genteel Phra&s;e.
Your Brother was here la&s;t Week, but I could not prevail with him to &s;ing
<HI>Polly Willis.</HI></P>
<P>That you may not think a Word of yours falls to the Ground, I mu&s;t
tell you that I de|livered your Me&s;&s;age to Mr. A&mdash;; at which, a
Mixture of Joy and Gratitude appeared in his Countenance; and being inclined to
believe it (and perhaps too complai&s;ant to call in Que&s;tion my Veracity)
did not in&s;i&s;t upon my Oath. He told me, he had, before this Time, done
him&s;elf that Plea&s;ure, had not Illne&s;s pre|vented him; but, if he lives,
he intends to &s;ee you this next en&s;uing Summer. I have been un|der dreadful
Apprehen&s;ions of his drawing near the Time of his Di&s;&s;olution, and great
Rea&s;on I <PB N="29" REF="47"> had, you'll &s;ay, when I tell you, that for
&s;ix Weeks he had not Spirits to &s;queeze <HI>his dear</HI> MOLLY by the
Hand. He has taken great Pains for upwards of thirty Years, to in&s;truct and
improve his little Flock; yet (&s;uch is the Perver&s;ene&s;s of the People,
and the Corruption of their Morals) that after a Sermon of half an Hour long, I
fear he had little Rea&s;on to be|lieve he had made any great Alteration in
their favourite Tenets.</P>
<P>I hope you are convinced, that the Con&s;e|quence of having a female
Corre&s;pondent, is to be pe&s;tered with Non&s;en&s;e, and the Return of a
very few Letters lets you into the Knowledge of the Materials wherewith a
Woman's Mind is furni&s;hed. From which of 'em &s;hall we claim

every Faculty to plea&s;e (if ever I were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any &s;uch) died

but as the Joy and Pride of my Heart withers in his Grave, my Mind 
<PB N="31" REF="49"> is continually haunting tho&s;e Man&s;ions of the Dead,
and is but too inattentive to what pa&s;&s;es in a World, where I have &s;till
Duties and At|tachments, which I ought to be, and, I hope, I may truly &s;ay, I
am thankful for. I am &s;ure my Affection for my Lord HERTFORD, and Solicitude
for his Welfare, are &s;incere; &s;ince, if I know my own Heart, I would not
deliberate a Mo|ment to lay down my Life for his Service. Lady BETTY and Sir
HUGH SMITHSON, and their Chil|dren, are ju&s;tly dear to me; and I &s;till feel
the Bonds of tender Friend&s;hip: but I enjoy all the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings with
Trembling and Anxiety; for, after my dear BEAUCHAMP, what human Things can
appear permanent? Youth, Beauty, Vir|tue, Health, were not &s;ufficient to

entertain my waking Hours. Tho' &s;ometimes I am able to view the bright Side

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN no longer forbear telling you, that you have in your la&s;t,
obliged me more than by any one Action of your whole Life, and for which I
could almo&s;t call you Friend; (which, I a&s;&s;ure you, is the highe&s;t
Appellation I can be&s;tow) for I mu&s;t tell you, that no one yet ever
commenced a Friend of mine, till they had corrected me of &s;ome Fault,
Failing, or Error; and tho' I've long &s;ince been taught, that I ought not to
make a Friend of any but my own Sex, together with other Particulars parallel
to that, yet I cannot but think it a friendly Act, and as &s;uch e&s;teem it.
For my|&s;elf, <PB N="36" REF="54"> let me &s;ay, that I am not &s;o
ob&s;tinate as to per&s;i&s;t in an Error for the Sake of &s;upporting a wrong
Judgment; and had I di&s;covered Rea|&s;on to di&s;pute Superiority with you in
any Re&s;pect, I &s;hould have thought you little wor|thy of my
Corre&s;pondence; in&s;tead of which, I allow you to excel, much beyond
my&s;elf, in all Pre-eminence.</P>
<P>Before I proceed any farther, let me clear Mrs. A&mdash; from the
<HI>A&s;per&s;ion</HI> her Judgment &s;eems to lie under in this Affair,
otherwi&s;e I &s;hall appear to be afraid of the Cen&s;ure it de|&s;erves. Know
then, 'twas I cho&s;e her Shape; and, peradventure, the better to &s;erve my
own Purpo&s;es; for how know you, but I intended to make a Letter-Carrier of
her, (as they do in <HI>Babylon, Aleppo,</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies)</HI>
and by that Means to accommodate my&s;elf with a &s;wifter Me&s;&s;enger than
the Po&s;t? And as I knew her Inclination, when a rea&s;onable Crea|ture, I
concluded, after Tran&s;migration, In|&s;tinct would then as naturally incline
her to frequent VIRGIL<HI>'s Grove.</HI> How unnatural &s;o|ever this Shape may
appear to the Grove, I mu&s;t tell you, I could produce &s;ome Authori|ties 
<PB N="37" REF="55"> on my Side, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e you have mentioned; but
I am not about to do this, for, as you &s;eem to di&s;allow it, I readily give
it up, and an&s;wer, 
<Q REND="inline">"True, O King!"</Q>&mdash;Nay, I think to be in the
Wrong, and to be re|proved in &s;uch an ingenious, humane, and po|lite Manner
by you, more than equals being in the Right. I believe too, 'twill be for your
Intere&s;t, that &s;he remain in her own Shape, for &s;ome Time, as her Fingers
are employed in knotting Fringe for you, &s;o you find you have no Occa&s;ion

<P>Marvel not that I don't admit your next A&s;&s;ertion, maugre all
the Forces you can rai&s;e, nay, tho' the whole nine Mu&s;es com|bined
again&s;t me, I'll be ab&s;olute for once. I am as tenacious of my Prerogatives
as any of my Sex, nor do I think I have been guilty of an Infringement in what
I have &s;aid. I am neither &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of Favours as not to
di&s;|cover 'em, nor am I &s;o proud, or &s;o prudi&s;h, as not to acknowledge
'em. Surely, you have dealt with none but the la&s;t-mentioned Sort of the Sex,
that you are &s;o alarmed at what I <PB N="38" REF="56"> have &s;aid. But no
more of this&mdash;I now enter a Caveat to the Subject.</P>
<P>Mr. A&mdash; is much plea&s;ed with your kind Remembrance of him. He
made an excellent <HI>Hare-Cha&s;e</HI> Preachment on the
<HI>Thank&s;giving-Day</HI>; for he told us all the Doublings and Turnings
<HI>the Pretender</HI> and his Party made from their fir&s;t Effort to their
Defeat. He has got his Brother with him, a Man, who&s;e A&s;pect, at one View,
di&s;covers to you the Im|becility of his Mind. I do not yet know in what
Capacity he is to act, but am a little afraid 'twill prove that of a Servant,

to &s;ee you, ere many Weeks be pa&s;t, and would beg of you to let me know by
a Line, when I am mo&s;t likely, or when very unlikely, to meet with you at
Home. The Rea&s;on why I can fix no week, at pre&s;ent, is, that I am in daily
Expectations of Mr. LYTTELTON, and the HAGLEY Family. I dined there, &s;ome
Time &s;ince, with Mr. PITT, Mr. BOUHOURS, Mr. CAMPION, and all the World. Mr.
THOM|SON, that right friendly Bard, was expected, and I fancy may be there now.
Mr. LYT|TELTON offered me the Vi&s;it, and I own I am plea&s;ed with the
Pro&s;pect of &s;hewing him &s;ome|thing at the <HI>Lea&s;owes</HI> beyond his
Expectations. I have made a great Improvement in VIRGIL's Grove, &s;ince you
were here, and have fini&s;hed a new Path from it to the Hou&s;e, after the
Manner you approved. They are going to build a Rotund to terminate the Vi&s;to

<P>AS it has hitherto &s;eemed good to you to expatiate pretty largely
on &s;o diminu|tive a Subject as a Thimble, I flatter my&s;elf that you may
read with Patience an Account of the Life and Conver&s;ation of your mo&s;t
trifling humble Servant. Otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould not have told you, that I am
extremely un|happy in my pre&s;ent Situation; that, when you left the Country,
I had recour&s;e to another Kind of natural Beauties, namely, that which is to
be found in 
<Q REND="inline">"Groves, Meads, and murmuring Streams,"</Q> and &s;o
long as Summer was plea&s;ed to continue his Favours, I looked upon your 
<PB N="46" REF="64"> Departure as what only changed my Plea&s;ure to
Amu&s;ement. Now, indeed, Summer has for&s;aken me likewi&s;e; the Trees and
Groves are &s;tripped of their Covering, and I am left without any Fence
again&s;t Spleen, Vapours, Megrim, Di&s;content, and a numerous Train of &s;uch
Sort of Beings, which plague me to Death, whenever I offer to recollect your
Ab|&s;ence; and how often that happens, I leave any one to gue&s;s but
your&s;elf, becau&s;e any one el&s;e is better acquainted with the numerous
Ways and Means you have of rendering your Company agreeable. I appeal al&s;o to
the &s;ame Per&s;ons to gue&s;s how provoking you are, when you mention the
Po&s;&s;ibility there was that I might have &s;een you at the
<HI>Lea&s;owes</HI> &s;ome Time ago. What need you tell one of it, &s;ince it
could not be effected? Why will you put me upon cur&s;ing Fortune upon more
Accounts than I have already Occa&s;ion to do? Pray let me endeavour to conform
my&s;elf to my real Circum&s;tances, rather than give me a Glimp&s;e of the
Plea&s;ure which you was about to do me, and yet had not the Goodne&s;s to go
through with. I want no Inducements to come to <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI> &s;ince I
di&s;covered that you lived there, <PB N="47" REF="65"> and that being all that

<P>I beg you would make my Compliments agreeable to Mrs. WINSMORE,
which you are be&s;t capable of doing, for two Rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, becau&s;e
you know the Sincerity of my E&s;teem, and, &s;econdly, becau&s;e I have no
Idea how any Thing you &s;ay can be di&s;agreeable. The Con|&s;ideration that
&s;he remembers me, and that &s;he &s;poke of me in the &s;ame Breath with Mrs.

<P>I WAS much concerned to hear by Mr. WILLIAMS's Account, la&s;t

Particulars of your Di&s;order he does not mention, but tells me, he was
de&s;ired to give it as a Rea&s;on that I did not hear from you before. It is
as natural for me to make En|quiry concerning the Recovery of your Health, as
it is for me to wi&s;h it, which I very ear|ne&s;tly do; I have, therefore,
&s;ent an hone&s;t Neighbour of mine upon this Errand, who will be glad of an

ever &s;ince I came from <HI>Barrels,</HI> been in a very dange|rous way; and
whether he ever may regain the &s;mall Share of Health he has been u&s;ed to,
is a great Que&s;tion, el&s;e I had &s;ent &s;omething <PB N="51" REF="69">
&s;ooner. But I mu&s;t reque&s;t your Lady&s;hip not to write, if you find it
the lea&s;t trouble|&s;ome. A verbal Me&s;&s;age will be very &s;ufficient,

<P>I have no Particulars that can tempt me to enlarge this Letter, and,
indeed, I hardly wi&s;h for any, le&s;t I &s;hould accidentally let fall any

&s;o highly agreeable to me at a more favourable Sea&s;on, can afford me little

<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER having owned, that the Fear your Lady&s;hip has been under, is
in reality to be imputed to me, I am at a Lo&s;s for Words to expre&s;s my
Concern, or to alleviate my Fault. I will not, however, di&s;allow that the
Book came to Hand much &s;ooner than I could rea&s;onably expect it, and that
the Let|ter enclo&s;ed in it, gave me that uncommon Plea&s;ure, which your
Lady&s;hip's never fail to do. I have nothing to &s;ay in my Behalf, but that I
have never had Health or Spirits &s;ince I received it, that might encourage me
to think I could return an An&s;wer as I ought; and even to-night my Spirits
are &s;o bad, and my Head &s;o confu&s;ed, that I have no Rea&s;on to hope
<HI>the&s;e few Lines</HI> can do any Thing more, than free you from your
pre&s;ent Uncertainty. But if I am honoured with a Line from your 
<PB N="54" REF="72"> Lady&s;hip hereafter, I will immediately acknow|ledge it
as well as I am able, let my Capacity be what it will.</P>
<P>I do not know how far your Lady&s;hip's Name may be
di&s;tingui&s;hable by a <HI>Po&s;t-Woman</HI>'s Ear; but this I know, that if
I had been Par|&s;on H&mdash;K, your Lady&s;hip &s;hould not have known from
me, that there was any Woman in the World, who could expre&s;s her&s;elf
con|cerning you with the Indecency you mention. I am a&s;toni&s;hed at her
Behaviour, and not a little at her Forgetfulne&s;s. There &s;eems to me to be
no &s;urer Conveyance in the World than that of the Farmer, by whom I &s;ent my
Letter to the Po&s;t-Office at <HI>Henley,</HI> and by whom, I &s;uppo&s;e, you
conveyed your Parcel. However, in Obedience to your Lady&s;hip's Commands, I
have &s;ent this Letter to Ma&s;ter H&mdash;K, and &s;hall have an additional
Pre&s;&s;ure on my Spirits, till I hear you have been plea&s;ed to forgive my
Neglect. I know extremely well, that Want of Time and Lei&s;ure, and &s;ome
other Excu&s;es, which are often made for not writing, can be of Weight from
<HI>no one</HI> but a Cobler, who has ten or a dozen Children dependent on a
<HI>Tatch|ing-End</HI>; <PB N="55" REF="73"> but I know as well, that your
Lady|&s;hip's is no ordinary Corre&s;pondence, and that a Per&s;on ought to
have a clear Head, and an unembarra&s;&s;ed Chearfulne&s;s of Temper, when he
&s;its down to an&s;wer any Letter of yours. For my Part, I hardly look upon
this as any Letter <HI>at all,</HI> and will infallibly write again, as &s;oon
as I can recover my natural State of Mind. I have <HI>as</HI> little Rea&s;on
to con&s;ider the enclo&s;ed <HI>as Poetry</HI>; but as they were
<HI>&s;hort</HI> Compo&s;itions, I had been writing them out ye&s;terday, with
a De&s;ign to &s;end them to the Po&s;t-Office to-night.</P>
<P>I am afraid I have tired your Lady&s;hip with Madrigal and Sonnet. I
hope, when the Weather gets finer (with which my Spirits uniformly
&s;ympathize) to vary my Stile a lit|tle for your Lady&s;hip's Amu&s;ement; in
the mean Time, I have &s;ent you a Poem, written by a Gentleman of my
Acquaintance, and &s;hewn up, for a College-Exerci&s;e, in Print. Your
Lady&s;hip will &s;oon di&s;cover a juvenile Want of Judgment in &s;everal
Places; but I tru&s;t that the Elegance of his Fancy you will admire. He
&s;ometimes comes and and &s;tays <PB N="56" REF="74"> a Month with me at the
<HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> in the Sum|mer; the next Time he does &s;o, I will be

am mi&s;taken, if he will not be plea&s;ed almo&s;t to a Degree of
En|thu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>As to your Lady&s;hip's Lamene&s;s, tho' it comes la&s;t in this
irregular Letter, I beg Leave to a&s;&s;ure you, that it gave me a &s;incere

<P>I AM quite a&s;hamed that I have not been able to make a &s;peedier

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I think it is a Sort of Maxim, that a Per&s;on in
<HI>London</HI> &s;eldom <HI>complains</HI> he is forgotten by his Friends in
the Country, yet I cannot, by any Means, prevail upon my Con|&s;cience to
acquit me of a Sort of di&s;re&s;pectful Silence, &s;ince your Lady&s;hip went
to Town. It was not either the Politics or the Amu&s;e|ments of our great
Metropolis, that could make the Letters of your Friends appear impertinent, or
even indifferent to you; and tho' the &s;ublime Entertainment you mu&s;t
receive from the Con|ver&s;ation of &s;o great a Man as Lord BOLING|BROKE,
might bid the faire&s;t to do &s;o, yet was I not without Conviction, that your
Lady&s;hip would feel &s;ome &s;ort of Complacency upon the Sight of a Scrip of
Paper, which &s;hould ac|quaint you that I was alive.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="81">Alive, indeed, I am; at lea&s;t, if it may be
called &s;o, to exi&s;t among a Set of People, who&s;e Employments,
Pa&s;&s;ions, and Sentiments, are entirely foreign to my own; and where I
&s;ee, and hear, and do nothing, but what I think may as well be left un&s;een,
unheard, and un|done. What can your Lady&s;hip expect from a Corre&s;pondent
&s;o &s;ituated, be&s;ide pure Re|&s;pect and Friend&s;hip, and many artle&s;s
A&s;&s;u|rances of their Reality and Continuance?</P>
<P>Mr. O&mdash; &s;tayed pretty near a Week with me. He has, I think,
&s;trict Honour, Good-nature, and good Sen&s;e. What he wants, in my Eye, is a
little genuine <HI>Ta&s;te</HI>; for tho' good Sen&s;e may, by Degrees, enable
a Per&s;on to di&s;cover the Beauties of Nature or Art, yet it can never
furni&s;h him with any extraordinary Reli&s;h or Enjoyment of them, which is
the Effect of innate Ta&s;te alone, and which differs as widely from the
former, as the Palate differs from the Brain. Your Lady&s;hip has, I dare
&s;ay, frequently made the &s;ame ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="82">You will hear Sir THOMAS LYTTELTON,
notwith&s;tanding he complained always of his <HI>Head,</HI> died of a
<HI>Polypus</HI> in the <HI>great Artery</HI>; which, I do not find, was ever,
in the lea&s;t, &s;u&s;pected by his Phy&s;icians; but which, if it had been
ever &s;o apparent, they could not po&s;|&s;ibly have cured. You will imagine
that his Death mu&s;t have thrown a Sort of Gloom round the Villages in his
Neighbourhood. A nume|rous and fa&s;hionable Family animates a Coun|try-Place
to an inconceivable Degree. The Family at <HI>Hagley</HI> will be immediately
di&s;per&s;ed. Mi&s;s LYTTELTON goes to Lady LITCHFIELD's, to the

<P>Lord DUDLEY and I dined together at <HI>Hag|ley</HI> la&s;t
<HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> where we found Lord AN|SON's <PB N="65" REF="83">
Brother, and &s;ome other Company. Mr. MILLER unluckily a&s;ked me at Table,
how I liked the new Situation of their Column; which threw me under a
Nece&s;&s;ity of offending either again&s;t the Rules of Politene&s;s, or (what
it more &s;acred with me) the Laws of Sincerity. The Truth is, I do not like it
upon many Ac|counts; and I am per&s;uaded, before many Years are pa&s;t, they
will be of the &s;ame Mind. But lea&s;t of all, do I approve their Intentions
of building three new Fronts, and altering every Room by a gothic Model, and
that with an Eye to Frugality, at the &s;ame Time that they have not an Inch of
Gothici&s;m about the Hou&s;e, to warp their Imagination that Way. But this
Subject never fails to lead me too far; nor can I explain my&s;elf to the full,
unle&s;s I could &s;hew your Lady&s;hip their Plan. The fine Si|tuation they
have, within an hundred Yards, they neglect;&mdash;in &s;hort, as it appears to
me, they are going to &s;acrifice an Opportunity of rendering their Place
compleat, for the Sake of an imperfect, but expen&s;ive Specimen of gothic
Architecture; which, not having its Founda|tion either in Truth or Proportion,
will fall into <PB N="66" REF="84"> Di&s;grace again in the Cour&s;e of a few

<DATE><HI>May</HI> 15, 1748.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW long &s;oever your Letters are in co|ming, they never fail to
a&s;&s;ure their Welcome, by being more agreeable and en|tertaining, as well as
breathing more of Friend|&s;hip, than any Body's <HI>el&s;e</HI> have the Art
of doing. I have been here about a Month, and find &s;ome little Improvements,
which were ordered when we went to <HI>London,</HI> compleated; 
<PB N="68" REF="86"> and I think they are not quite unworthy of the Name. A
Piece of wa&s;te Ground, on the lower Side of the Abbey-Walk, has been turned
into a Corn-Field, and a Turf-Walk, about eight Feet wide, round it; clo&s;e to
a flouri&s;hing Haw|thorn Hedge; on one Side, there is a thatched Seat open on
three Sides, which pretends to no Name of greater Dignity, than ju&s;tly
be|longs to what it repre&s;ents, namely a Shep|herd's Hut; before it there is
an irregular Piece of Turf, which was &s;pared for the Sake of &s;ome old Oaks
and Beeches, which are &s;cattered upon it; and as you are &s;itting down
there, you have, under the&s;e Boughs, a direct View of <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>
Ca&s;tle. There are Sweet-Williams, Narci&s;&s;us's, Ro&s;e-Campions, and
&s;uch Flowers as the Hares will not eat, in little Borders, round the Foot of
every Tree; and I almo&s;t flatter my&s;elf, that you would not be
di&s;plea&s;ed with the rural Appearance of the whole. The Rains have given us
the &s;tronge&s;t Verdure I ever &s;aw: our Lawns and Meadows are enamelled
with a Profu&s;ion of Da&s;ies and Cow&s;lips, and we have the greate&s;t
Appearance of Fruit that has been &s;een the&s;e many Years. I conclude you
will read Mr. <PB N="69" REF="87"> THOMSON's <HI>Ca&s;tle of Indolence</HI>:
'tis after the Manner of SPENCER, but I think he does not always keep &s;o
clo&s;e to his Stile, as the <HI>Author of the School-Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI>
who&s;e Name I never knew, till you were &s;o good as to inform me of it. I
think it a charming Poem; and was very much plea&s;ed with his Ballad of
<HI>Queen</HI> ELIZABETH's &s;eeing the Milk-Maid. She ap|appears, at lea&s;t
in my humble Imagination, in a more natural Light, than when we hear of her
bullying foreign Powers, and cutting off the Head of an unhappy Queen, who fled
to her for Protection. But to return to <HI>the Ca&s;tle of Indolence</HI>; I
believe it will afford you much Entertainment; there are many pretty Paintings
in it, but I think the <HI>Wizard's Song</HI> de&s;erves a Preference.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"He needs no Mu&s;e who dictates from his
Heart."</Q> Have you met with two little Volumes, which contain four
Contemplations, written by a Mr. JAMES HERVEY, a young <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> or
<HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> Cler|gyman? The Subjects are upon walking among the
Tombs, upon a Flower Garden, upon Night, and upon the &s;tarry Heavens. There
is &s;omething poetical and truly pious. Now I have got into the Impertinence
of recommen|ding <PB N="70" REF="88"> Books to one who is a much better Judge
than my&s;elf, I mu&s;t name an <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Delicacy,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<P>The <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Delicacy,</HI> here mentioned, was the
Pro|duction of Dr. NATHANIEL LANCASTER, many Years Rector of <HI>Stanford
Rivers,</HI> near <HI>Ongar,</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> Uncle to the Editor of
the&s;e Letters. He was a Man of &s;trong natural Parts, great Erudition,
refined Ta&s;te, and ma&s;ter of a nervous, and at the &s;ame Time, elegant
Stile, as is very obvious to every one who has had the Happine&s;s to read the
E&s;&s;ay here &s;poken of. His Writings were fewer in Number than their
Author's Genius &s;eemed to promi&s;e to his Friends, and his Publications
le&s;s known than their intrin&s;ic Excellence de&s;erved. Had he been as
&s;olicitous, as he was capable, to in&s;truct and plea&s;e the World, few
Pro&s;e-Writers would have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him; but in his later Years, he
lived a Reclu&s;e, and whatever he compo&s;ed in the Hours of retired
Lei&s;ure, he (unhappily for the Public) ordered to be burned, which was
religiou&s;ly (I had almo&s;t &s;aid irreligiou&s;ly) performed.</P> 
<P>He was a Native of <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and, in his earlier
Years, under the Patronage and Friend&s;hip of the late Earl of CHOLMONDELEY,
mixed in all the more exalted Scenes of poli&s;hed Life, where his lively
Spirit, and brilliant Conver&s;ation, rendered him univer&s;ally
di&s;tingui&s;hed and e&s;teemed; and even, till within a few Months of his
De|cea&s;e, (near &s;eventy-five Years of Age) the&s;e Faculties could &s;carce
be &s;aid to be impaired.</P> 
<P>The <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Delicacy,</HI> (of which we are now
&s;peaking) the only material Work of his, which the Editor knows to have
&s;urvived him, was fir&s;t printed in the Year 1748, and has been very
judiciou&s;ly and meritoriou&s;ly pre&s;erved by the late Mr. DODSLEY, in his
Fugitive Pieces, publi&s;hed in two Volumes.</P></NOTE> a Subject which, if I
were not acquainted with <PB N="71" REF="89"> you, and one or two more, I

Dear Madam, from the extreme good Character which every Body gives of your Son,
and which his Behaviour to you proves he de&s;erves. May this, with every other
Ble&s;|&s;ing, be long continued to you, and may you always look upon me as a

<P>I FIND a very &s;trong Impul&s;e, prompting me to write to you this
Evening. I don't know whether I ever let you into the Secret, that I re|ceive
an inward Satisfaction at the Time that I am &s;ending you a Letter, and that
this Action partakes of the Nature of all virtuous ones, in being its own

entirely on the Friend&s;hip of a few private Acquaintance, and if they drop

Truth is, I am not quite convinced (tho' I have acted as if I were) that one
&s;hould give up any Part, that appears droll in it&s;elf, and makes the Poem,
on the whole, more agreeable, for the Sake of rendering it a more perfect

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Remember Mrs. HIGGONS u&s;ed to &s;ay, Lady CLARENDON had &s;uch a
Power over her Under&s;tanding, that &s;he might per&s;uade her &s;he was a
Fi&s;h. You have pretty near the &s;ame A&s;cendant over mine, yet cannot quite
convince me, that eight Months is not an immoderate while to keep Silence, and
make a Cha&s;m in a Corre&s;pondence with a Friend, who ince&s;&s;antly
wi&s;hes to hear of your Health and Happine&s;s. I am not more ea&s;ily
&s;educed into an a&s;&s;ent to your Apology; for though I admire the beautiful
Language in which the Fiction of your Dullne&s;s is painted, I cannot mi&s;take
it for a Truth. I am &s;o bad at Inven|tion, that I will not &s;earch for an
ingenious Fable, to excu&s;e my&s;elf for troubling you with an An&s;wer &s;o
&s;oon, though my Readine&s;s to obey <PB N="82" REF="100"> your Commands, in
&s;ub&s;cribing for the Prints you mention (if you will let me know where I
mu&s;t &s;end for a Receipt) might furni&s;h me with one: but hone&s;tly own,
that as my Lord has been in <HI>London</HI> &s;ince <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> I did
not know how to employ the lei&s;ure Hours his Ab&s;ence afforded me, more to
my Satisfaction.</P>
<P>We returned hither from <HI>Bath</HI> only <HI>Friday</HI> the
Eleventh: we were there two Months, the la&s;t Fortnight of which we were
detained, after all our Things were gone, by my poor Lord's having a Fit of the
Gout; and I be|lieve we came away rather too &s;oon after it, for his Limbs had
not recovered their Strength, &s;o that he was terribly fatigued; however, he
has now recovered it, and is certainly upon the whole infinitely the better,
for having drank the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters. If I could envy you, dear Ma|dam, I
&s;hould be tempted to do it, for being in Reach of <HI>Hagley,</HI> for having
Mr. WEST for a Neighbour, and Mr. SHENSTONE for a Friend. He has obliged me
&s;o much, in letting me &s;ee his charming Ode upon Autumn, and the Ho|nour he
does Mr. THOMSON's Memory in that Poem, and in his De&s;ign to erect an Urn 
<PB N="83" REF="101"> for him in VIRGIL's <HI>Grove,</HI> that I am &s;orry I
cannot agree with him, in his Di&s;like to <HI>Au|tumn.</HI> On the contrary, I
draw one Motive of my Partiality to it, from a &s;imilar Cau&s;e to what he
partly a&s;cribes his Aver&s;ion: he hates it as a Sea&s;on which deprived him
of a Friend; I love it, becau&s;e the late&s;t Days my Heart could boa&s;t of
Happine&s;s, in the be&s;t and mo&s;t beloved of Sons, were in that Time of the
Year, till (as Dr. YOUNG &s;ays) 
<Q> 
<L>&mdash;At <HI>Death</HI>'s Toll, who&s;e re&s;tle&s;s, iron
Tongue</L> 
<L>Calls daily for his Millions at a Meal,</L> 
<L>Starting I woke, and found my&s;elf undone.</L></Q></P>
<P>And then, 
<Q> 
<L>The Clouds, the Winds, the Rains, the falling Leaves,</L> 
<L>The naked Branches, the poor &s;hivering Birds&mdash;</L></Q>
Every Thing around me &s;eemed to &s;ympathize in my Di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;till
at every melancholy Anniver&s;ary of my ever-to-be-lamented Lo&s;s, put on the
&s;ame friendly Appearance of &s;ocial Sorrow; and I may &s;ay with MYRA, in
her <PB N="84" REF="102"> Poem, before Mr. THOMSON's fir&s;t Edition of the
Sea&s;ons, 
<Q> 
<L>To thee, my gently-drooping Head I bend,</L> 
<L>Thy Sigh my Si&s;ter, and thy Tear my Friend.</L></Q></P>
<P>Forgive me, dear Madam, for thus continu|ally returning to this
afflicting Subject: but two Lines of Mr. POPE's, with the Alteration only of
one Word, mu&s;t plead my excu&s;e,

<P>I have done&mdash;and will now tell you, that our being obliged to
go to <HI>Bath,</HI> has hindered us from undertaking any Thing here, &s;o that
I have nothing to talk of that is new, and I am afraid there was Nothing here
before, that would make a tolerable Figure, either in a Print or a Drawing; a
Flat can hardly look well upon Paper, though in reality, the Variety of Woods
and Lawns, Water, Gra&s;s, and Gravel, may produce a Contra&s;t not
unplea&s;ing to the Eye. I am &s;orry you find any Defects in Mr. HERVEY; for
both the De&s;ign and Manner of his Writing plea&s;es me extremely.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the fir&s;t Place, I return you Thanks for your very polite
Letter, which, I do a&s;&s;ure you, I was proud of receiving, and &s;hould have
troubled you with an An&s;wer the &s;ame Day, could I write with as little
Difficulty as you.</P>
<P>I admire the Counte&s;s's Letter, and e&s;pe|cially that Part about
her Son. She &s;eems &s;en&s;i|ble of her great Lo&s;s &s;till. She talks of
VIR|GIL's <HI>Grove,</HI> as if &s;he had &s;een it. I am &s;ure, if &s;he had,
&s;he would have been highly de|lighted with the Beauties of that Place. I want
Summer to come, that I may &s;ee the Urn, which you intend to erect to
THOMSON's Memory, and VIRGIL's <HI>Grove</HI> in Perfection.</P>
<P>With Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and Inattention, I have read Mrs.
PILKINGTON's &s;econd Volume; &s;he <PB N="87" REF="105"> is &s;till more
entertaining; I think &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;es her&s;elf well; I fancy too her
Poetry to be good; and I dare &s;ay, &s;he will think it hard not to be allowed
the Liberty of her Tongue and Pen.&mdash;But I ought to be a&s;hamed of giving
my Opinion, with &s;o much Free|dom, to one who is &s;o good a Judge of
Wri|ting as you are.</P>
<P>My <HI>Litchfield</HI> Journey afforded me but &s;len|der
Amu&s;ement; le&s;s even than I expected. Mrs. DOLMAN had two Vi&s;itants, Mrs.
WHIT|BY and her Daughter, who came from the &s;ame Town where Lord ANSON lives.
They talked much in Prai&s;e of his Lord&s;hip, and &s;eemed to be intimate
Acquaintance of his.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s FLETCHER's &s;evere Letter has never been an&s;wered yet: I

Re&s;pect, I am utterly unable to judge, as your Lady&s;hip's Directions were
not very <HI>explicit,</HI> and as I have not been favoured with a &s;ingle
Syllable from Mr. H&mdash;LL, to inform me <HI>whether,</HI> or <HI>how
far</HI> he approved of <HI>any</HI> Alterations. But what Harm do I commit? I
do not call them <HI>Alterations,</HI> which I &s;end; they are only a &s;mall
Cargo of different Expre&s;&s;ions, which I &s;incerely de&s;ire you will apply
or <HI>reject,</HI> entirely as you think <PB N="92" REF="110"> proper; nor
&s;hall it give me the lea&s;t Offence if you reject the whole, if &s;o be you

Thoughts, I think the Epitaph on Mr. H&mdash;LL's Father, and, indeed, all
Epitaphs, &s;hould be &s;hort. What I have chiefly aimed at in Number I. and
Number II. is to expre&s;s his <HI>general</HI> Character in few Words.
Neverthe|le&s;s, if Mr. H&mdash;LL chu&s;es to have a more <HI>par|ticular</HI>

de&s;ire, for I believe his Father might de|&s;erve as good an one, as any

pompou&s;ly. Perhaps, I am <HI>too</HI> &s;crupulous; however, I wi&s;h your
Lady&s;hip may be full as much &s;o, in Regard to my trifling Critici&s;ms.

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Lady&s;hip bids me give you an Ac|count of what Alterations we
are making at pre&s;ent, but I feel my&s;elf much le&s;s able to de&s;cribe the
Fabrick and Furniture of a Palace than a Hermitage, and while I am attending to
all my Lord's De&s;igns there, I fancy I'm no better acquainted with the Effect
it will pro|duce, than a Per&s;on would be with the Beauty of a Piece of
Tape&s;try, who &s;aw only the wrong Side of it. My Lord will do a good Deal to
the Front of the Hou&s;e, in order to make it appear le&s;s like a Pri&s;on; he
builds a new Wing on the Right-hand Side of the Gar|den, which will contain a
Library, Bed-Cham|ber, Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, and a Waiting-Room. I think I told
you, that all the Sa&s;hes, Doors, and Ceilings, in both Apartments, mu&s;t be
in|tirely <PB N="97" REF="115"> new, and the Floors in my Lord's; the
Stair-ca&s;e is very noble, but will require as large a Lanthorn to light it,
as that at <HI>Hough|ton,</HI> &s;o much celebrated in the News-papers. The
Chimney-Pieces in both Apartments are to be all new, and &s;ome of them very
expen|&s;ive; the Draughts are mighty pretty. My Lord's Bed on the Ground-Floor
is crim&s;on Dama&s;k, with Tape&s;try Hangings; the next Room is furni&s;hed
with green Dama&s;k, on pur|po&s;e to &s;et off his Pictures; the next with a
Set of very fine old Hangings of the Duke of NEWCASTLE's Hor&s;eman&s;hip, with
his own Pic|ture, on Hor&s;eback, as big as Life; and, now they are clean,
looking neat, as when new. The Parlour to be hung with &s;ome very good
Pictures; above Stairs, the great waiting Room, with <HI>Saxon</HI> green Cloth
Chairs, with gilt Nails, and green Lute&s;tring Window Curtains, mar|ble Table,
and large Gla&s;s between the Win|dows; fir&s;t Drawing-Room, new crim&s;on
Da|ma&s;k, with Lute&s;tring Window Curtains, two very fine <HI>Japan</HI>
Tables and Gla&s;&s;es between the Windows, with carv'd and gilt Frames; inner
Drawing-Room, Tape&s;try Hangings, with &s;mall Figures very pretty, and as
fre&s;h as new. <PB N="98" REF="116"> He lays two Rooms together in the right
Wing of the Court, on the ground Floor, in order to make a Chapel, with a
Gothic Wain&s;cot, Cei|ling, and painted Windows; there is to be a
<HI>Dutch</HI> Stove in it, which is &s;o contrived, as to repre&s;ent a Tomb
with an Urn upon it. The Court is to be paved, and the Foot-Way al|tered; and
my Lord is in Treaty for nine Hou&s;es on the other Side the Way, in order to
pull them down and build Stables, (for there are none belonging to the Hou&s;e)
who&s;e Gates are intended to open directly over again&s;t tho&s;e of the
Court; if he can agree for this Purcha&s;e, he will widen the Street in that
Part about eight Feet. Now, dear Madam, I have obeyed, you in the be&s;t Manner
I am able: but upon looking back into my Letter, I find I have forgot my
Bed-Chamber, Dre&s;&s;ing-Room and Clo&s;et, which one would think, &s;hould
not appear lea&s;t intere&s;ting to my&s;elf; the fir&s;t of the&s;e is to have
a new Bed-Hanging, and Chairs of crim|&s;on Queen's Dama&s;k; the
Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, which has two large Sa&s;hes, will have Tape&s;try Hangings
and green Dama&s;k Chairs; the Clo|&s;et, which is &s;mall, and has only one
Sa&s;h, ex|actly facing the Chimney, furni&s;hed with paint|ed 
<PB N="99" REF="117"> Paper; the Chimney-Piece in the Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, is to
be of Statuary-Marble and <HI>Giallo di Siering,</HI> and ju&s;t in the Front

there is another little Waiting-Room, at this End of the Apartment, for the

thought by young, gay People. The cold North Winds have blighted and ruined the
Beauty of my Ro&s;es for the Remainder of this Year, and &s;tarved all the
various Flowers, which u&s;ed to adorn our Clumps and Borders. The Time of our
going into <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> remains unfixed; but I fancy it will be in about
a Month: and we have taken a new Hou&s;e in <HI>Bath,</HI> for the fir&s;t Week
in <HI>September,</HI> &s;o that in&s;tead of en|joying my peaceful Shades, as
I u&s;ed to do, <PB N="100" REF="118"> I appear engaged in a tedious
Pilgrimage, and am looking (over the Charms of the Summer Month) to a re&s;ting
Place in <HI>Northumberland-Hou&s;e,</HI> and where, perhaps, I may never come;
the probability is much &s;tronger again&s;t me, than it was, this Time five
Years, again&s;t my ever-lamented BEAUCHAMP; and indeed I am far from well at
pre&s;ent, having a mo&s;t terrible Cough and Cold, with a continual Head-ach
and Sickne&s;s at my Stomach.</P>
<P>I am glad to hear, that Mrs. W&mdash;L's &s;eem|ing Neglect did not
proceed from her own Heart, but the Hardne&s;s of another's, which is a
Stranger to all that is gentle or humane. I am per&s;uaded, your Improvements
will add great Beauty to your Habitation, and would make me long to &s;ee it,
if I were a movable Being, but you know I never was fond of tra|velling, and I
cannot take a Journey now, but as the <HI>Rhodian Colo&s;&s;us</HI> might do.
Among all my Lord's Acqui&s;itions, none has given me more Plea&s;ure than his
Chaplain, who is be|tween &s;ixty and &s;eventy, very well bred, &s;trictly
pious, and they &s;ay, is an admirable Scholar; has a Genius for all the polite

but naturally inclined to a &s;olitary Country Life; in &s;hort, we are all
fond of his Company, from my Lord to the lowe&s;t Servant in the Hou&s;e. I am

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Whitchurch,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 7, 1749.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE buried a Friend, who has made me his Executor, and, of
con&s;equence, I have had a good deal of Fatigue. I tell you this thus
abruptly, becau&s;e I could not have wrote a Sentence without blu&s;hing, till
I had, in my Opinion, made a rea&s;onable Excu&s;e for my &s;eeming Neglect of
you; you, who &s;o abun|dantly obliged me by your la&s;t Favour. The Flowers
were the fine&s;t I have &s;een this Sea&s;on, though I have &s;een tho&s;e of
a celebrated Flo|ri&s;t this Year&mdash;inferior in no Re&s;pect, and
&s;upe|rior in this, (which weighs much with me) that they will not fade. Such
is the Advantage of Art, the Offspring of the Mind, above the peri&s;hable
Beauties of Nature. I am &s;ure they &s;hall never peri&s;h in my Hands, for I
&s;hall even piou&s;ly tran&s;mit them down to Po&s;terity, 
<PB N="103" REF="121"> as they de&s;erve. You are continually finding out
&s;ome new Way to ravi&s;h your Friends, and yet that &s;eems needle&s;s,
&s;ince in your old one, I mean that of Wit, you &s;eem to be infinite. All
this is &s;o, and &s;o &s;uperlatively &s;o, that I begin to think my&s;elf a
Fool to hold &s;o unequal a Cor|re&s;pondence. I am a Gainer in one Re&s;pect,
but I am certainly a Lo&s;er in another. It is a great Proof of my Affection to
you however, for none but mean Souls would, otherwi&s;e, prefer their
Plea&s;ure to their Honour. To &s;peak in the mo&s;t &s;incere Manner, I never
am &s;o &s;en&s;ible of my own Inability, as when I take one of your Letters
before me to an&s;wer it. Emulation immediately cea&s;es, and then you cannot
wonder if I fall even below the Bathos of my own Genius.</P>
<P>I know you are, by this Time, impatient to hear what Friend I have
lo&s;t. It is Mr. BROOKER, of whom you have often heard me &s;peak. I have
<HI>got,</HI> indeed, by his Death, but I a&s;&s;ure you, no Gain would be
&s;ufficient to make me unconcerned at the Lo&s;s of a Friend&mdash;&s;o far
from it, that the Acqui&s;ition only adds <PB N="104" REF="122"> to the
Tenderne&s;s, and con&s;equently to the Re|gret.</P>
<P>Now I mu&s;t return to the old Burthen. When &s;hall I &s;ee
you?&mdash;I long to &s;ee you&mdash;'Tis more than GARRICK playing RICHARD to
&s;ee you&mdash;the next highe&s;t Pitch my Imagination can &s;oar. I long too
to &s;ee your Alterations, which I look upon as &s;o many of your vi&s;ible
Ideas.</P>
<P>As for my Retreat, it is not worth de&s;cri|bing; or, to de&s;cribe
it at once, I may call it a Band-Box, <HI>viz.</HI> "The Citizen's Delight."
However, I wi&s;h you were in it: and now let me propo&s;e my Scheme. It is the
&s;ame I pro|po&s;ed la&s;t Year. It is to meet either here, or at
<HI>London,</HI> fir&s;t; for I &s;hall be alternately at both Places, and will
order my Route at your Plea&s;ure. I purpo&s;e going &s;oon; but a Let|ter from
you &s;hall determine my Schemes at any Time. Though if I &s;hould be at
<HI>London,</HI> and you would come thither fir&s;t, and after|wards with me to
<HI>Whitchurch,</HI> it would com|pleat my Wi&s;hes, for I long to be at both
Places with you. My Re&s;idence in <HI>London</HI> is at Mr. PEARETH's
Chambers, <HI>King's-Bench-Walks,</HI> <PB N="105" REF="123"> No. 7; but direct
to me at <HI>Whitchurch</HI> as yet.</P>
<P>If you have any Vanity, it mu&s;t be exqui&s;itely fed by the
&s;malle&s;t Favour from Lady LUXBO|ROUGH. If you have a Ta&s;te for
Plea&s;ure, refined to the highe&s;t Degree, (Why did I &s;ay, <HI>If?)</HI> by
all Accounts, her Politene&s;s mu&s;t gra|tify it to the full. When I &s;ay
this, I don't &s;peak in the Gro&s;s; I don't &s;ay, that this Per|&s;on or the
other &s;aid &s;he was a Wonder, (tho' that I can aver too) but I go upon
better Grounds for my A&s;&s;ertion, than general Applau&s;e; I go upon
Particulars, from which I have formed a Character that mu&s;t be beautiful.</P>
<P>You complain of Mr. &mdash;. I told him of it, but don't know
whether he has made an At|tonement. I am a good deal picqued at him my&s;elf.
Tho' we live next Door to each other, he has &s;pent but one Evening with me
&s;ince he has been at &mdash;, and that was after a thou&s;and
Remon&s;trances, and much again&s;t his Will. He neglects every Body for his
Wife; in &s;hort, <HI>he is no more.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I look upon the Date of your Letter, it puts me both out of
Coun|tenance and Patience with my&s;elf. Your Letter found me at <HI>Bath,</HI>
from whence, I thank God, my Lord is returned with his Health and Ap|petite 
<PB N="107" REF="125"> much improved; and I hope, the good Effects of this
Journey, will continue longer than tho&s;e of the preceding Years. Our
Ser|vants and Goods have all been removed to <HI>Northumberland-Hou&s;e,</HI>
&s;ince before Michaelmas, but when we &s;hall get into it our&s;elves, is yet
among the Secrets of Fate. It is &s;till hid with Scaffolds towards the Street,
but by the Plan, and the little I could &s;ee of it when I was in
<HI>London,</HI> on the King's Birth-Day, it will be very hand&s;ome, and
indeed it &s;hould, my Lord de&s;tined 10,000<HI>l.</HI> for the Alterations;
but I believe he has by this Time experienced, that he deceived him&s;elf, at
not &s;etting it at above double; for though the Hou&s;e it&s;elf will not
co&s;t, perhaps, above 14.000<HI>l.</HI> yet the Hou&s;es he has purcha&s;ed,
in order to widen the Street and build his Sta|bles, and the Remainder of the
Duke of CHAN|DOS's grant for <HI>Scotland-Yard,</HI> which he is in Treaty for,
in order to carry down his Garden, and open a View from his Hou&s;e to the
<HI>Thames,</HI> will co&s;t at lea&s;t as much more. Mean Time, you may

already gone a Month pa&s;t her Reckon|ing, I &s;hould like to be nearer to
her. I was not eight and forty Hours in Town, when I went to be pre&s;ented, on
my Lord's new Earl|doms, and to make my Appearance on the Birth-Day; for I went
from hence at Seven on the <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, and was pre&s;ented that
Day at Noon, and on the <HI>Monday,</HI> as &s;oon as the Drawing-Room was
over, undre&s;&s;ed and came back directly. I lay at Sir HUGH SMITHSON's, for I
could not have a Room at <HI>Northumberland-Hou&s;e,</HI> and I have never
&s;een <HI>London</HI> &s;ince. We have the mo&s;t glorious Weather that I
believe was ever &s;een in Winter: but, alas! I can only admire it from my
Windows, being under Dr. SHAW's Hands, for the ill Con&s;equence of a Fall,
which I had before I went to <HI>Bath,</HI> by a Servant heedle&s;sly taking
away a Chair, ju&s;t as I was going to &s;it down, and which I took too little
Care of at fir&s;t, &s;o I am now forbid all Sort of Exerci&s;e, which gives me
but a melan|choly Pro&s;pect, as to my Health, for the fu|ture: but God's Will

<P>Have you &s;een a little <HI>French</HI> Book called <HI>Con|&s;eils
&agrave; une Amie,</HI> &s;aid to be written by Madame de POMPADOUR: the Name
of the Author will not induce you to expect any very exalted Sentiments of
Religion or Morality; but it contains good Rules for making a proper Figure in
High-Life. I have al&s;o had the Letters of Mon&s;ieur RACINE LE PERE, and
&s;ome Me|moirs of his Life, by his Son, lent me; and they give me a greater
E&s;teem for him as a Man, than as the Author of <HI>E&s;ter and Athaliah.</HI>
I hope you have &s;een my old Acquaintance, the Mini&s;ter of B&mdash;'s

ima|gine how he can reply to it, without owning him&s;elf a Dei&s;t, or
explaining &s;ome of his Innu|endos in a different Way to what they appear at
fir&s;t Sight. Mr. and Mrs. WYMONDESOLD's hand&s;ome Behaviour to you, dear
Madam, gives me a good Opinion of them both. I be|lieve I &s;hall never have

&s;o ill, but I hope his Mu&s;e has not left him; I am &s;ure yours has not; I
am confident &s;he attended you very agreeably upon his Bench. Mr. LINDSEY, my
Lord's Chaplain, (who by the Way is a very good Judge, and a pretty Sort of

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Return you a Multitude of Thanks for the Favour of your la&s;t
Letter to me. I think you &s;eem to have had as &s;olitary a Winter as we have
at <HI>Broom.</HI> This is the Sea&s;on a Town Life is va&s;tly preferable to
that of the Country; the Country now is only fit for Poachers and Game-keepers.
Like old DARBY and JOAN, we live now upon the Thoughts of pa&s;t Plea&s;ures; 
<Q> 
<L>In fondly meditating o'er</L> 
<L>Pa&s;t Plea&s;ures, and in hoping more.</L></Q> However, we have
two Amu&s;ements which ne|ver fail us, and tho&s;e are Reading and Mu&s;ic. In
order that we may enjoy the latter in a great|er Degree than we have done of
late, we have got Mr. G&mdash; over &s;ometimes, you know, who has procured us
a new Spinnet, and he &s;ays, <PB N="112" REF="130"> he'll make us proficient
in the Art of Mu&s;ic pre&s;ently, provided we will but be diligent.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent for the Pamphlet that is wrote again&s;t Mr.
G&mdash;'s Compo&s;itions. As he's my Ma&s;ter, I have a Curio&s;ity to it. He
&s;ays, it pulls him all to Pieces. I can't tell what Ge|nius he has for
compo&s;ing Mu&s;ic, but certainly he's a very good Mu&s;ic-Ma&s;ter. As a
Compa|nion, I do not much admire him: I think he's a di&s;agreeable Man; very
mercenary; always full of E&s;teem for him&s;elf, and of Contempt for all
others; and does not con&s;ider, that it is almo&s;t as glorious to acknowledge
Merit in other Per&s;ons, as to have it one&s;elf: but he &s;ets good

<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN very faithfully a&s;&s;ure your Lady&s;hip, that the
Plea&s;ure I received from your <HI>French</HI> Letter was equal to what I
expected; and as I can hardly form an Expre&s;&s;ion that implies my 
<PB N="114" REF="132"> Approbation more fully, I ought, perhaps, to add nothing
more upon this Head. How|ever, I can ill avoid being more explicit; for
be&s;ides that your Choice of Words gives me an agreeable Idea of the
<HI>French</HI> Language, there is I don't know what Kind of Plea&s;ure
ari&s;es upon &s;eeing common or dome&s;tic Affairs treated of in a Language
foreign to one's own. I wi&s;h it may not one Day tempt me to hazard a few
<HI>French</HI> Lines to your Lady&s;hip, altho' I have, in a great Mea&s;ure,
forgot the Termination of my Moods and Ten&s;es, and &s;hould of cour&s;e make
a thou&s;and Blunders, in regard to the proper Idiom: but if I &s;hould, I
tru&s;t your Lady&s;hip would be prevailed upon to burn what I wrote
immediately. Surely it is either owing to the Delicacy of your Choice, or the
<HI>French</HI> have great Numbers of Words more ex|pre&s;&s;ive than our own:
for In&s;tance 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>trop bonne pour avoir Be&s;oin de cet
A&s;&s;ai&s;onnement</HI>;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> 
<Q REND="inline">"Too good to &s;tand in need of this
Recommendation."</Q></NOTE></Q> I know not of any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Word that
would be proper here be&s;ides Recommendation, which is greatly inferior. I
have ob&s;erved the &s;ame of many others. But I confine my Partiality to their
<HI>Pro&s;e,</HI> and I dare &s;ay your Lady&s;hip (who <PB N="115" REF="133">
knows &s;o well all the Beauties of their Lan|guage) is al&s;o not unacquainted
with the Im|perfections of it; by which Means you find your&s;elf &s;o well
enabled to di&s;gui&s;e the latter, at the &s;ame Time that you are
di&s;playing the former. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;uppo&s;ed Qua|lifications of
the GLUMS and the GAWRIES ex|cites one's Curio&s;ity, the Book does not, I
think, de&s;erve a Place in your Lady&s;hip's Library, and I would not have you
purcha&s;e it. It makes two Volumes in 12mo. Price 6s. It came into my Way,
&s;o I read it, giving it ju&s;t Atten|tion enough to let it amu&s;e me with
the imagi|nary Scenes it de&s;cribes. As to what I &s;aid of the
<HI>Scribbleriad,</HI> you will ob&s;erve, I had read nothing but a few
Quotations, and am now to reque&s;t your Lady&s;hip's Opinion, who have
re|ceived the Book. Believe me, my Lady, I am not lazy in <HI>Mind.</HI> I long
for nothing &s;o much as bodily Health and Spirits, to be able to ac|quit
my&s;elf better of my Share of the Corre|&s;pondence, and to de&s;erve the
Vivacity of yours &s;omewhat more than I do. But when I &s;hall be able to
exchange the Cypre&s;s Grove for the more agreeable Verdure of the Myrtle or
the Laurel, is a Que&s;tion I cannot pretend to &s;olve&mdash;Very 
<PB N="116" REF="134"> pedantic truly this!&mdash;But to proceed: I wrote many
ludicrous Things at College, and in the former Part of my Life, and one or two
of the&s;e am I thinking to enclo&s;e during this in&s;ipid Sea&s;on; perhaps
taking, like Woodcocks, the Advantage of a Fog, they may hope at &s;uch a Time
for &s;omething better Quarter, though, to &s;peak the Truth, they are much too
&s;illy, and your Judgment too penetrating, to give them any Room for &s;uch an
Expectation. As to printing, I will not &s;ay that I never intend it, but I
mu&s;t fir&s;t be able to &s;pend a few Weeks with my Friend GRAVES, who is a
Per&s;on of great Delicacy, and who&s;e Friend&s;hip may, per|haps, induce him
to examine my Trifles with &s;ome Attention, no very agreeable Ta&s;k to him or
any one el&s;e. Mean Time, the Complaint you make of your pre&s;ent Want of
Amu&s;ement, gives me an Occa&s;ion to pour in Floods of my <HI>written</HI>
Impertinence. The <HI>Progre&s;s of Ta&s;te</HI> I meant to &s;hew you long
ago. The <HI>Snuff-Box</HI> (which by interweaving another Poem or two, is now,
I &s;ee, a mere Piece of Patch-Work) ap|pears before you for no other Rea&s;on
in the World, but that it happens to be tran&s;cribed in the &s;ame Book with
the former; and is intere&s;ted <PB N="117" REF="135"> in my de&s;iring you not
to read a Line of it. I &s;end al&s;o the Ode I fir&s;t mentioned to the
Du|che&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"<HI>Rural Elegance,</HI>" an Ode to the
late Duche&s;s of SOMERSET. See SHENSTONE's Works, Vol. i, Page 105.</NOTE> and
would a&s;k, in the fir&s;t Place, whether it <HI>de&s;erves</HI> Correction?
If you would not choo&s;e I &s;hould immediately de&s;troy it, will you be &s;o
Kind as to mark any Improprieties, or propo&s;e any Improvements to me? I hope
you will be in no concern about defacing the Copy, in that Ca&s;e, for I would
write it over ever &s;o often, if I could by that Means add a Syllable that was
more expre&s;&s;ive of my Veneration for her Grace, or that tended to give her
a Mo|ment's Amu&s;ement. I calculated the <HI>Subject</HI> as well as I could;
but I am fearful you will di&s;cover nothing but common-place Thoughts. I think
mo&s;t of my Ver&s;es &s;mell of nothing but Field-Flowers, and con&s;idering
how I &s;pend my Time, they can &s;carce do otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>A Word more, in regard to the propo&s;ed Al|teration in your Room.
If your Lady&s;hip does not choo&s;e to go to the Expence of a carved Frame,
what think you of a white oval Frame to your Gla&s;s in the middle, and a
Fe&s;toon on <PB N="118" REF="136"> each Side; this with the Stucco need amount
to no more than four Guineas. But the Room is mighty well as it <HI>is,</HI>
and you are your&s;elf the Judge, whether the Expence of the Altera|tion would
afford you an an&s;werable Amu&s;e|ment. I am greatly plea&s;ed with what your
Lady&s;hip mentions of coming to the <HI>Lea&s;owes</HI>; for tho' you will
&s;ee but little new this Year, yet by allowing your&s;elf &s;ome little Time,
you will &s;ee the &s;ame with much greater Ea&s;e than you could before; and
if I &s;hould add, Plea&s;ure, I hope you will allow it to my Fond|ne&s;s for a
Place that has engro&s;&s;ed my Care &s;o long. You complain, Madam, of the
Want of fre&s;h Ideas, (which I never yet ob&s;erved in your Conver&s;ation or
Letters at any Time or Tide) gue&s;s, however, what mu&s;t be <HI>my</HI>
Ca&s;e, who &s;ee nothing from Day to Day but

<DATE><HI>May</HI> 24, 1751.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Ha&s;ten to acquaint your Lady&s;hip, that my Brother is now
greatly better, and, is, we all hope, in a fair Way of Recovery.</P>
<P>What &s;mall Hopes I have entertained for mo&s;t Part of the Time
&s;ince I wrote la&s;t to <HI>Barrels,</HI> have been rather owing to a Kind of
Self-Flattery, and an Unwillingne&s;s to De|&s;pair, than any proper
Foundation&mdash;but the&s;e three Days, his Di&s;order is &s;o much abated,
that they &s;eem to receive &s;ome Sanction from <HI>Rea&s;on</HI>; not that I
am entirely free from Ap|prehen&s;ions. The a&s;thmatical Di&s;order is fallen
down into his Legs, where it continues at pre|&s;ent. But what by Means of
A&s;s's Milk, which agrees with him, the Advantage of a few Days, in which he
has been carried Sedan-Fa&s;hion <PB N="120" REF="138"> about my Grounds, and
the mo&s;t &s;crupulous Care, in regard to what we &s;uffer him to eat or
drink, his Spirits, Pul&s;e and Com|plexion are a&s;toni&s;hingly recovered,
and his Strength and Stomach proportionably re&s;tored.</P>
<P>I will not detain your Lady&s;hip any longer on this Head, than to
acquaint you, that I have thought about writing to <HI>Barrels</HI> every Day
&s;ince your Servant was here; but finding all along, &s;uch frequent Changes
in the Di&s;or|der, and being utterly incapable to give your Lady&s;hip any
<HI>&s;atisfactory</HI> Account, I had not the Spirit to &s;et Pen to
Paper.</P>
<P>This has been to me the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable Sea&s;on, for a
Continuance, I ever &s;pent in my Life; betwixt &s;leeple&s;s Nights, painful
Ap|prehen&s;ions, con&s;tant Solicitude, Confinement, and an entire Alteration
in regard to my Way of Life, I found my own Situation not a little endangered:
but as the original Cau&s;e begins to cea&s;e, I hope the Effect will. I might
have added to the former Vexations, the Difficulty of procuring good Advice,
and the no le&s;s Difficulty of prevailing on my Brother to fol|low 
<PB N="121" REF="139"> it. Such Per&s;ons as he ought always to be well; I
mean, to guard more than <HI>others</HI> again&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es, as they have
&s;o little Pa|tience in re&s;erve to &s;ubmit to the Means of Cure.</P>
<P>But to lead your Lady&s;hip from the &s;ick Room into the open Air a
little&mdash;I am now beginning, for the fir&s;t Time, to bru&s;h up my Walks.
The Trees and Shrubs are in full Bloom all of a &s;udden; I mean, &s;o far as
concerns the green Leaves, for the latter have not yet flowered. The Servants
are now very bu&s;y in cleaning my Grove, &amp;c. whither I &s;tray now two or
three Times a Day, with great Complacency. I doubt the Death of poor Mr.
H&mdash;LL's Brother will occa&s;ion him much worldly Perplexity, as well as
Concern, at pre&s;ent: I would otherwi&s;e pre&s;s him to &s;pend a Week with
me at the <HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> as &s;ome Kind of Relief to him, and a great
Plea|&s;ure to us. I think a Change of Place, after &s;uch an Affliction, is
very often of no &s;mall Service. That Book of Mr. PEARSALL's which your
Lady&s;hip &s;ub&s;cribed for, is come out, I hear, but I have had no Copies
&s;ent yet. Your <PB N="122" REF="140"> Lady&s;hip, I know, intended to oblige
<HI>me</HI> by your Sub&s;cription, and THAT Point you can never fail to
obtain&mdash;more I am not at Liberty to &s;ay. You will plea&s;e to mention
this Publica|tion to Mr. H&mdash;LL; I &s;ent <HI>his</HI> Name, tho' I am not
<HI>&s;ure</HI> that he &s;ub&s;cribed: but I know he would be the readie&s;t
of Men to &s;erve an old Schoolfellow. Would your Lady&s;hip be &s;o Kind as to
lend me POMPEY <HI>the Little?</HI> I have read, as I &s;aid before, nothing
but Phy&s;ic-Books for the&s;e la&s;t &s;ix Weeks, and I want now to be
indulged with &s;omewhat more amu&s;ing. I won't pretend to your Lady&s;hip
that I am a very great <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> but I con&s;ider my&s;elf as
qua|lified to make the be&s;t <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> of any body in the three
Kingdoms. I hope &s;oon to be able to adju&s;t a Time, when I may have the
long|wi&s;hed-for Happine&s;s of waiting on your Lady|&s;hip at the
<HI>Lea&s;owes.</HI> In the mean Time, I am to return my Brother's Thanks with
my own, for every obliging In&s;tance of your Regard, and to &s;ub&s;cribe
my&s;elf inviolably</P>

<P>I did not propo&s;e to do <HI>much</HI> about my Hou&s;e this

find &s;ome Plea&s;ure in the Conjecture, that the Money which might have been
expended upon Rooms or Furni|ture, has been &s;pent with &s;ome Effect upon my
Brother's Recovery; without which, the <HI>Lea&s;owes</HI> would have afforded
no Plea&s;ure of one while. I hope, with this good Weather, your Lady&s;hip's
wonted Spirits will return; I hope, al&s;o, that I &s;hall henceforth be able

<P>I Return you the Collection of Poems, which you were &s;o kind as to
&s;end me, and can but acknowledge my&s;elf very much obliged to you for the

<P>If I did not expect the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them &s;oon again in

Reluc|tance, without having taken the Liberty of tran&s;cribing &s;ome of them
for my Amu&s;ement hereafter: but &s;omething whi&s;pers me in my Ear, that you

<P>Sometime before my Lord DUDLEY &s;ets out for <HI>London,</HI> my

<P>I came Home from the <HI>Grange</HI> &s;o much ena|moured with the
Concert I heard there, that the De&s;ire I had before of being a Performer in
&s;uch a one has, if po&s;&s;ible, taken a deeper Root. CLARENDON calls
Ambition a Weed, which, he &s;ays, is apt to grow in the be&s;t Soils, &s;o I
will not be wholly void of it; I will be ambi|tious of attaining to &s;ome

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD wrote to your Lady&s;hip long before this Time, to acknowledge
the Kindne&s;s of your Letter and Pre&s;ent: but I have a mo&s;t deplorable
Account to give of my Delay, and what &s;o good a Friend as your&s;elf will not
read without a Sigh. Alas, dear Madam, I have lo&s;t my only Brother! A more
&s;incere or truly affectionate one never bore the Name. I cannot now add more;
tho' I &s;hould not want Matter to expatiate upon his Merit, if I were not at
the &s;ame Time to revive and lament the Lo&s;s of it. He is gone <HI>before
me</HI> in the very Prime of his Days, and ere the Force of his
Under&s;tanding, or the Benevolence of his Heart has been half exerted or
known.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="146">Future Letters, and other Conver&s;ations, may
afford me an Opportunity to pour out all my Soul; at pre&s;ent, I am not enough
Ma|&s;ter of my&s;elf. I find all my Views intercept|ed: my Schemes,
Mea&s;ures, and even my Heart it&s;elf, to be well nigh broken. I have lo&s;t
that Spirit of a Man, which alone is able to &s;u&s;tain his Infirmities. Every
Object round me, that was once the Source of my Amu&s;e|ment, revives a Train
of Ideas that I can hardly render &s;upportable. I procure a Set of low Friends
to chat around me, and call off my Attention. But the greate&s;t Relief I have
found, &s;ince the fatal Clo&s;e of <HI>November,</HI> is what I have drawn
from Stupefaction.</P>
<P>Pardon me, my good Lady; I do not mean to make a Di&s;play of my
Affliction. I mention it, that you may account for, and excu&s;e any
Omi&s;&s;ions or Improprieties in your unfortu|nate Corre&s;pondent.</P>
<P>Since this unhappy Cata&s;trophe, it has been my Lot to hear of one
that mu&s;t nearly af|fect your Lady&s;hip. Believe me, my honoured Lady, I am
far from an unconcerned Ob&s;erver <PB N="129" REF="147"> of Events, that
mu&s;t afford you either Plea&s;ure or Pain. But I am not in a Condition to
<HI>re|ceive</HI> Relief, and how can I pretend to <HI>give</HI> it? One Thing,
however, I will &s;ugge&s;t&mdash;I think <HI>CAESAR</HI> confe&s;&s;ed at an
earlier Period of Life than what my Lord BOLINGBROKE arrived at, that he had
lived enough, either in regard to Nature or to Glory.</P>
<P>During the Height of our Afflictions, we can &s;carce believe it
po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould ever wear off. In my Ca&s;e, there are &s;ome
Parti|culars which render it improbable they &s;hould. Yet Time, we find,
alleviates the Misfortunes of others, and it is fitting we &s;hould hope
im|plicitly, that it may &s;ome how dimini&s;h our own.</P>
<P>I will excu&s;e your Lady&s;hip from dwelling upon the Subject.
A&s;&s;ure me only of the Con|tinuance of your E&s;teem, and it will be of
great|er Service than whole Volumes of Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Pray be &s;o good as to write or dictate a Let|ter to me. I
earne&s;tly pray that it may be <PB N="130" REF="148"> the former, I am, dear

<P>This is the third Time I have begun this Letter, without being
able to fini&s;h it till now. If your Lady&s;hip will favour me with a Line, I
hope to be able to an&s;wer it without the &s;ame Difficulty.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome Thoughts of waiting on you at <HI>Barrels</HI> for a
Week, when I hear you are come down, but I have had a Kind of nervous Fever,
for which I have been taking Medicines. This I did, tho' I knew at the &s;ame

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. GRAVES has lately &s;et me right as to a Mi&s;take, which
otherwi&s;e I might have remained in much longer. As I hope to live, I had
quite forgot my Promi&s;e of writing to you from <HI>London,</HI> and &s;o
wondered I did not hear from you. But upon his men|tioning it, I immediately,
to my great Con|fu&s;ion, recollected my Error. I felt a great deal of
Unea&s;ine&s;s, while I imagined the Fault to lie at your Door; but I
a&s;&s;ure you, much more, &s;ince I find it to be at my own. In|gratitude is
what I mo&s;t abhor; and I mu&s;t be a Mon&s;ter, to &s;light &s;uch a Favour
as your la&s;t to me, and from &s;uch a Friend. Pray believe me incapable of
it, or of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;erene Mind, while there &s;hould be any
Mi&s;un|der&s;tanding between you and me. I am like|wi&s;e &s;incerely
concerned for the Death of your Bro|ther, e&s;pecially as Mr. GRAVES &s;ays, it
touched <PB N="132" REF="150"> you &s;o nearly, con&s;equently I &s;hould
advi&s;e you to change the Place a little after &s;o melancholy an Affair; and
I am &s;ure you can find in no Place, <HI>one</HI> who would be more
&s;olicitous to divert you than at <HI>Whitchurch.</HI> I can't a&s;k that
Favour of you, becau&s;e I am &s;o much in Debt to you already. But it would
give me a double Plea&s;ure, &s;ince I believe at pre&s;ent it might be
beneficial to you. For my own Part, I long to wait on you; but my Mother's
State of Health is &s;o bad, that I mu&s;t not think of gratifying that
Pa&s;&s;ion this Summer; tho' I can hardly lay that Hope a&s;ide, or forbear
&s;aying, that a &s;mall Altera|tion in her for the better would make me
pur|&s;ue it. I have got a little Chai&s;e, which at pre&s;ent I am much
plea&s;ed with, and I a&s;&s;ure you, its Wheels have a natural
<HI>Penchant</HI> to run to the <HI>Lea&s;owes.</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h'd for you much at <HI>London.</HI> Plays are well worth
&s;eeing now. I reckon tho&s;e who can't be plea&s;ed with the pre&s;ent
Per|formances of the Stage, are too delicate ever to be plea&s;ed. There are a
great many very good Actors, and &s;ome (GARRICK and Mrs. CIBBER) acknowledged
to exceed all that ever <PB N="133" REF="151"> have been. You mu&s;t come once
more in|to the World, I mean to <HI>London</HI>; I am &s;ure it will do you
good: I find the Benefit of it my&s;elf; Change of Place gives me Spirits for
the Year, which, I find, fail me very much without&mdash;Don't let us grow old
if we can help it; and I think Variety and new Scenes are the mo&s;t likely to
keep us young, at lea&s;t produce the Effects of Youth. I own Life is dull at
be&s;t, and therefore it is the wi&s;e&s;t Way to vary it as much as
po&s;&s;ible. The mo&s;t &s;tupid Vulgar (both high and low) find their Account
in this Method. Then you mu&s;t find a double Plea&s;ure in it, who know how to
vary it &s;o elegantly, as to entertain others as well as your&s;elf. I
a&s;&s;ure you, you &s;ucceeded &s;o well as to the fir&s;t, when you were
here, that your Prai&s;es are &s;till blooming; the agree|able Impre&s;&s;ion
&s;till remains on all. I long to &s;ee you, and hope to hear from you. Pray
harbour no ill Thought of me, for if I have erred, it was, I a&s;&s;ure you,
from Mi&s;take or Forgetfulne&s;s, and not with Intention. I never did, nor
ever can, mean Ill or Di&s;repect to dear Mr. SHENSTONE, but &s;hall ever be

<HI>that</HI> Score, you make me doubly &s;en&s;i|ble how unable I am to make a

<P>The Day after I left <HI>Barrels,</HI> I had a Morning Vi&s;it from
Admiral SMITH, Captain WHOOD, Mrs. STANLEY, and her two Daugh|ters, who engaged
me to dine with Sir G. <PB N="135" REF="153"> LYTTELTON. The&s;e are Ladies of
Ta&s;te, I think; but Admiral SMITH is the Delight of Mankind! I forgot to
mention Mr. MILLER, who &s;eems to recommend my Walks with great Cordiality. I
&s;ee they conde&s;cend to look upon <HI>modern</HI> Plans at <HI>Hagley,</HI>

<P>Since this I have &s;een a good deal of Com|pany, more of whom
arrive to &s;ee my <HI>Walks</HI> than <HI>me</HI>; yet I am not jealous or
invidious: my Walks are truly more de&s;erving of this Favour.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, I had the Company of Mi&s;s LEA, and Mr. HILTON, a very
mode&s;t and ingenious Man, who came with Lord DUD|LEY from <HI>London</HI>;
be&s;ides two other Parties of Vi&s;itants, who engro&s;&s;ed my whole Day.</P>
<P>And now I &s;it down by <HI>Five</HI> in the Morn|ing to an&s;wer
your Queries concerning the <HI>Papier-Mach&eacute;e.</HI> It is bought of Mr.
BROM|WICH, at the <HI>Golden-Lion,</HI> upon <HI>Ludgate-Hill.</HI> What you
will want, will be an Ornament <PB N="136" REF="154"> for the Middle, and four
Spandrells for the Corners. I have taken down the Pine-Apple from the middle of
my Cieling, and &s;end it you to &s;ee, together with &s;ome other Orna|ments
which were never yet fixed up. They will co&s;t (I mean a middle and four
corner Ornaments) &s;omewhere about eight Shillings. You may ornament it
<HI>more</HI> or <HI>le&s;s</HI> tho' as you plea&s;e. As to the Cracks of your
Cieling, (which I don't remember) if they are not violently bad, they may be
mended by a com|mon Ma&s;on, and the <HI>Colour</HI> will di&s;gui&s;e them. As
for putting them up, I will &s;end you over a very agreeable Neighbour of mine,
who was once an eminent Uphol&s;terer, but now lives upon his Fortune, who
&s;eems glad of the Op|portunity it will give him to &s;ee <HI>Barrels,</HI>
and the Honour it will afford him of being &s;er|viceable to your Lady&s;hip.
They &s;hould be painted with Flake White and thin Starch; but all this he will
manage to your entire Satis|faction. He is a Per&s;on of Ta&s;te, has &s;een a
good deal of Life; and tho' he has had his Share of Difficulties, always
chearful. You mu&s;t not offer him any Thing. Thus have I been as &s;hort as I
can, in pointing out <PB N="137" REF="155"> your quicke&s;t Method of
embelli&s;hing your Cieling. The whole Cove (except the Moul|ding) &s;hould be

arrives.</P>
<P>I beg my Thanks to Mrs. WEYMONDE|SOLD, for her kind Remembrance of
me: am a little fearful her Vi&s;it will be too late in the Year; but 'tis in
Mrs. WEYMONDESOLD's Power to make <HI>all</HI> Sea&s;ons plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>My Lord DUDLEY will be extremely glad to wait on Mr. OUTING: but he

<DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 9, 1750.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM extremely &s;orry for the Accident which prevented my having
the Plea&s;ure of hear|ing from you, and &s;incerely hope you have overcome all
the ill Effects of it. You are very obliging in the Concern you expre&s;s, for
the Scenes of Sorrow I have pa&s;&s;ed through. I have, indeed, &s;uffered
deeply; but when I <PB N="142" REF="160"> con&s;ider it is the Will of God, who
never cha|&s;ti&s;es his poor Creatures but for their Good, and reflect, at the
&s;ame Time, how unwor|thy I was of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, which I now la|ment
the Lo&s;s of, I lay my Hand upon my Mouth and dare not repine; but I hope can
with Truth appeal to him in the following Words: 
<Q>Que&s;to affano ei &s;u che non &s;i oppone al &s;uo &s;anto
voler: Chio gemo e gli affro tutti il ge|miti miei Chio Rango &amp; in tanto
Benedico il &s;uo Nome in Mezzo al Pianto.</Q></P>
<P>You are &s;o good, as to wi&s;h my Solitude may afford me &s;ome
Amu&s;ement; and as I think it a Duty, while it plea&s;es God to con|tinue us
here, not to let our&s;elves &s;ink into a &s;tupid and unthankful Melancholy,
I endea|vour to find out &s;uch Entertainments, as my Retirement, and my dear
Lord's unmerited Bounty will admit of. I have built a Por|ter's Lodge at my
Gate, and am now turn|ing the long Drawing-Room into a Chapel, which will be
fini&s;hed in the Gothic Ta&s;te, and have three fine painted Windows; the&s;e
I <PB N="143" REF="161"> had be&s;poke for <HI>Northumberland-Hou&s;e,</HI> but
as its pre&s;ent Owners do not intend that their Chapel &s;hall be in the
&s;ame Place that we had propo&s;ed, they would not have fitted there. The Room
where you were &s;o good as to break|fa&s;t with us, and my Lord's Bed-chamber,
I could not bear to go into &s;ince my <HI>irrepara|ble</HI> Misfortune, and
therefore, with Lord NOR|THUMBERLAND's Advice, have laid them to|gether, which
will make a Room of 35 by 21. I &s;hall put up a very pretty Chimney-Piece in
it with Paper, on which I &s;hall hang my be&s;t Pictures.</P>
<P>The Sea&s;on for &s;ome little Alterations with|out Doors is now
coming on, and I intend &s;ome Change in my Ro&s;ary, and Openings in other
Parts of the Park. I have al&s;o erected a little Hermitage in one of the Woods
near the Canal, who&s;e Roof is thatched, and its Walls of Straw. I read as
u&s;ual, and have lately been much plea&s;ed with the new Edi|tion of SULLY's
<HI>Memoirs.</HI> Be&s;ides this, my own Servant and my&s;elf have worked five
cro&s;s-&s;titch Chairs, and intend three more for my Chapel; they are a Gothic
Mo&s;aic, in fine Crim&s;on, and are to have Gothic Frames. 
<PB N="144" REF="162"> Thus, dear Madam, I have given you an Account of my
Schemes and Occupations. My Company, at pre&s;ent, con&s;i&s;ts of Dr. LE
COURAYET, Mr. COWSLAD, and my Chaplain, who is a mode&s;t, &s;en&s;ible and
truly pious young Man. The Gentleman who travelled with poor Lord BEAUCHAMP has
been with me two Months, but left me ye&s;terday. What is come to Lord
LUXBOROUGH, or rather to his Son? And why is poor Mrs. WYMONDESOLD to be
treated as an Alien? I conclude &s;he did not marry without her Father's
Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>I hear an extreme good Character of your Nephew, Lord ST. JOHN,
which I am &s;ure will give you Plea&s;ure. I mu&s;t do Lord EGRE|MONT the
Ju&s;tice to tell you, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible for any one to behave in a
more kind and hand&s;ome Manner, than he has done ever &s;ince my dreadful
Lo&s;s; but Mrs. O&mdash;N has never taken the lea&s;t Notice of me. Lord and
Lady NORTHUMBERLAND are at pre&s;ent in the Country, and very well. I am &s;o
near the End of my Paper, that I mu&s;t only add the A&s;&s;urance of being,

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Letter with which you favoured me de&s;erves my earlie&s;t
Acknowledgments, and will prove not a little &s;erviceable, in re|gard to the
Sub&s;cription we have in Hand. The whole Account of that Affair is as
fol|lows: I had been a&s;&s;ured by Per&s;ons of Ve|racity, (among&s;t which I
may &s;afely name Lord DUDLEY, Mr. PIXELL, and THO. COT|TEREL) that you had
generou&s;ly made an Of|fer of twenty Guineas towards the Addition of two new
Bells to our pre&s;ent Set; and that in Ca&s;e the Pari&s;h would &s;upply what
was wanting, it would be a Plea&s;ure to you, Sir, to have your Offer accepted.
Upon this Encouragement, I determined to make Trial what a Sub&s;cription would
produce, and ac|cordingly drew up a Form for that Purpo&s;e; intending to write
you an Account of the <PB N="146" REF="164"> Undertaking, &s;o &s;oon as I
could form a Con|jecture of its Succe&s;s. This I was upon the Point of doing,
when I had the Plea&s;ure of a Letter from you, which, neverthele&s;s, was
extremely &s;ea&s;onable, as it immediately removed a Doubt that began to
&s;pread, in Regard to your Concurrence.</P>
<P>There is now &s;ub&s;cribed, (exclu&s;ive of your Benefaction) the
Sum of fifty Guineas; and I make no Scruple of rai&s;ing twenty more, by an
Application to &s;uch Per&s;ons as have not yet been &s;olicited. Be our
Progre&s;s what it will, I purpo&s;e in a few Weeks to give you a farther
Account of it; in the mean Time, can a&s;&s;ure you, that the Sub&s;cription
will be pu&s;hed forward with all po&s;&s;ible Diligence, that it may give us
the earlier Chance for the Plea&s;ure of your Company. I have only to add, that
the Bells will never &s;ound more agreeably, than when they ring for your
Arrival; will be heard no where more advantageou&s;ly than from &s;ome Parts of
my Farm, and that you will find no one more de&s;irous of making the Coun|try
agreeable to you than</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>March</HI> 20, 1753.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR two la&s;t Epi&s;tles, of the 4th and 9th In&s;tant, merit
greater Acknowledg|ments than the trifling Return of mine. I am going upon an
Expedition in a few Hours, yet mu&s;t not neglect a&s;&s;uring you, how
great|ly I think my&s;elf indebted to your Care and Informations relative to my
Tenants, and beg, if they apply to you again, to tell them, I have lately had a
Letter from Mr. I&mdash;, who has promi&s;ed me to be down at Lady-Day, and
&s;ettle Affairs with them all. The Brickman's Bill is much higher than I
thought it would have been. Believe me, between Law|yers and Builders I am
almo&s;t wearied out of my Life, and &s;incerely wi&s;h my&s;elf di&s;engaged
from them, e&s;pecially the former; I hope they may be the la&s;t Set of People
applied to by you or me.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="166">The Malady you complain of at pre&s;ent is
not, I conjecture, &s;o much owing to the Winter, as to Solitude; Cold braces
and Heat relaxes. Could you have in Winter the &s;ame Round of Company and
enchanting Scenes that you enjoy in Summer, your Nerves would, I am con|vinced,
be &s;tronger, and your Spirits more alert. Your Friends (more particularly
my&s;elf) ought to think our&s;elves much obliged to you for that &s;mall
Palliative you admini&s;ter to your languid Hours, in thinking of, or writing
to us. I could cure you much better by a Pre&s;crip|tion out of Madame DE
MAINTENON's <HI>Letters,</HI> or our Friend HORACE, than by any the whole
<HI>Materia Medica</HI> affords; &s;hould the&s;e fail, SAP|PHO, that
univer&s;al <HI>Panacea,</HI> might prove a Re&s;torative. I think my&s;elf
very happy in ha|ving this Opportunity of conveying to you, (according to
Promi&s;e) what &s;he &s;ays of you in her Letter to me, which I &s;hall do in
her own Words, <HI>viz.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"Pray tell the <HI>Salopian</HI> Bard, that 'tis my
Wi&s;h more than Hope, to pre&s;erve him as an Admirer; I would cautiou&s;ly

new Road will admit of their Coach, if I will e&s;cort her to the
<HI>Lea&s;owes.</HI></P>
<P>I was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed at being nomi|nated for a
Commi&s;&s;ioner of our new Road, as my Re&s;idence is precarious; my Vote, if
ne|ce&s;&s;ary, will be guided by Merit, and the Di|rection of my Friends. As
C&mdash; has been a Servant to my Father, and recom|mended by you as
de&s;erving, I will give him my Vote, if in the Country. My Lord DUDLEY has
been applied to by Captain W&mdash; for his Father, but declined it, and was
&s;o good to declare to me, he would &s;erve C&mdash; before he &s;aw your
Letter.</P>
<P>The &mdash;, who <HI>never knew me at Hales,</HI> met me at my
Lord's Hou&s;e, and reque&s;ted my <PB N="150" REF="168"> Vote; my An&s;wer
was, I knew &s;o little of the Affair, and my coming down was &s;o un|certain,
that I could not declare my&s;elf in any one's Favour.</P>
<P>Mr. CHEEK I have not lately &s;een. Mr. OUTING and &s;elf &s;et out
this Day for <HI>Pur|ford's-Green,</HI> to make a Vi&s;it to our hone&s;t
Friend CHARLES WALKER, where we hope to arrive before this Letter does at
<HI>Lombard-Street.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord, Mi&s;s LEA, Mrs. ROCK, and her Daughter, all join in
Compliments and good Wi&s;hes to you. They are in tolerable good Health,
excepting now and then catching Cold. I had the Plea&s;ure of the three la&s;t
to Break|fa&s;t with me ye&s;terday Morning.</P>
<P>Mr. O&mdash; has often been &s;olicited by me to write to you, which
he &s;incerely &s;ays he intends when we return to <HI>London</HI> next Week,
and with his Compliments, hopes you will forgive the &s;eeming Neglect he has
been guilty of. His going to &s;leep at the <HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> and my
accompanying him therein, has been often <PB N="151" REF="169"> Matter of
Di&s;cour&s;e between us. He declares, he will &s;oon write a Panegyric upon
Sleep, and the Benefit ari&s;ing from the unre&s;trained Occupation of one's
own Bed.</P>
<P>I can furni&s;h you with few Particulars con|cerning Mrs. W&mdash;'s
Amour. All I know is, her Hu&s;band and other People had ocular Demon&s;tration
of her Guilt, by a Servant Boy's boring three Holes in the Wain&s;cot, which
were afterwards cut in one. I am my&s;elf &s;orry to &s;ee a Per&s;on
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of amiable and noble Qualities, &s;o much &s;unk by one fatal
Error; and much greater is her Fall, when the <HI>le&s;s</HI> malicious Part of
the World condemn her, and declare her Foible of no late Com|mencement. Mr.
O&mdash; tells me, Mr. K&mdash; (though I &s;hould little have thought it)
wears a <HI>tri&s;te</HI> Vi&s;age on this Occa&s;ion, and whimpers that he is
much concerned.</P>
<P>Your Gla&s;s is done, and I have got the gold Cla&s;p back from the
Cha&s;er's. Do let me procure you &s;omething, if it is but in Silver, which
perhaps you may like as well, and be Money in Pocket.</P>

<P>WHILST your Lady&s;hip's Spirits appear as perennial as your Genius,
I have a deplorable Account to give you of my own. They have been, in &s;hort,
but few Degrees better than they were the la&s;t fatal Winter: and though I was

<P>Suffer me to thank you here, Madam, for the very &s;triking
Amu&s;ement I received from tho&s;e Letters; I read them twice, and as I 
<PB N="156" REF="174"> have &s;ullied the Copy you were &s;o good to lend me, I
will &s;end another I be&s;poke for my&s;elf, as &s;oon as it arrives.</P>
<P>The Memoirs of Lord BOLINGBROKE's Life abound too much with
Politicks for <HI>me.</HI> I be|lieve the <HI>World</HI> al&s;o would be as
well plea&s;ed with the more private Anecdotes of &s;o great a Man. Herein your
Lady&s;hip would &s;hine; and I could wi&s;h you to engage in &s;omething of
this Kind, though ever &s;o &s;hort; if not for the Public, at lea&s;t as an
Amu&s;ement to your|&s;elf and Friends, and a Legacy to the pre|&s;ent Lord
BOLINGBROKE, or whom el&s;e you &s;hould prefer.</P>
<P>Now I have begun to mention Books, let me fini&s;h the Subject. The
<HI>Game&s;ter</HI> I have read no more of, than what I gleaned from the
Quotations in the Magazines. I never yet had any Opinion of the Genius of Mr.
MOORE, and I hardly think I &s;hall alter my Sentiments, on Account of this
Performance. The <HI>Moral,</HI> however, mu&s;t be allowed to be extremely
&s;ea&s;onable.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="175">The <HI>Earl of E&s;&s;ex</HI> I have read;
the <HI>unfortunate</HI> Earl of ESSEX! who&s;e Story, whatever it may

am willing, with your Lady&s;hip, to make all Allowances for the Writer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brothers,</HI> which I have al&s;o read, is a noble Tragedy,
full of refined and elevated Sentiments, and, generally &s;peaking, of
&s;uita|ble Expre&s;&s;ions. I am not blind to many of its Faults&mdash;but I
have read nothing of late Years that has <HI>affected</HI> me more.</P>
<P>Shall I beg the Favour &s;ome Time of bor|rowing "<HI>Manners,</HI>"
the Book you mention to have read.</P>
<P>I don't remember to have heard you men|tion any Thing about
VOLTAIRE's la&s;t Play. I therefore &s;end it&mdash;and thus ends all I have to
&s;ay upon the Article of Books.</P>
<P>I am truly glad to hear that you had Mrs. DAVIES &s;o long at
<HI>Barrels,</HI> to counterwork the Effects of this unjoyous Sea&s;on. For my 
<PB N="158" REF="176"> own Part, had my Health permitted, I could gladly have
borne a Part there; but I have been little better in bodily Health than I have
been in Mind; and <HI>Home,</HI> when one is not truly well, has more
Attractions than Ely&s;ium. Pardon this unpolite A&s;&s;ertion, which &s;eems
to partake of Selfi&s;hne&s;s: and yet it is <HI>as</HI> un|polite at lea&s;t,
to offer one's Company to ano|ther, when one is not plea&s;ed with it
one's-&s;elf. I deny that Penances can be done at <HI>Barrels.</HI> At the
<HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> I have had many a Winter's Experience they may; and what
adds to their Severity is, that they are no way meritorious.</P>
<P>The Jack was &s;ent to COTTEREL to be copied in Mahogany long ago.
'Tis po&s;&s;ible, your Servant may find it ready to take Home.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOthing but ill Health could have hindred me from writing to you,
and acknow|ledging the mo&s;t agreeable Favour of your Letter. I have been
confined ever &s;ince <HI>Chri&s;t|mas</HI> with that odious Di&s;temper the
Gout. The very Name of it is abominable. What leng|thened my Confinement was,
that as &s;oon as I was almo&s;t well, I fell down Stairs, hurt the 
<PB N="161" REF="179"> Part, and was again laid up; but you'll &s;ay, I might
have wrote for all this. Indeed I could not. For one of the malicious Imps of
the old Demon got into the Fore-finger of my right Hand at the &s;ame Time. I
can &s;hew the Mark now&mdash;Be&s;ides, my Mother's Health has been &s;o bad,
as quite to di&s;pirit me, and continues to be &s;o; el&s;e I a&s;&s;ure you, I
&s;hould think of &s;eeing the <HI>Lea&s;owes</HI> this Summer. But I can't do
it, as Things are, upon any Ac|count, nor &s;hould I ever forgive my&s;elf,
&s;hould &s;he die in my Ab&s;ence. All the&s;e Rea&s;ons have likewi&s;e
hindered my Journey to <HI>London</HI> this Year. Mr. PEARETH too, has been
exceeding ill; &s;o that I may look upon this Year, as unfortunate both to
my&s;elf and Friends. I hope, however, you have not felt the Influence of this
evil Star. That Health and Happine&s;s may attend you, is the Intere&s;t of all
that know you; mine I am &s;ure in particular; and I can add, that I am
thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of it.</P>
<P>I am an Architect at pre&s;ent. Since I have been able to hop about,
I have amu&s;ed my|&s;elf that Way. I have been altering the Di&s;|po&s;ition 
<PB N="162" REF="180"> of my Rooms, and have made them more commodious as I
think: but I will not prejudice your Judgment before-hand. I have, like you,
been at &s;ome Expence this Way. But there are two Imperfections I have to
&s;truggle with at <HI>Whitchurch,</HI> which never appeared at the
<HI>Lea&s;owes</HI>; an indifferent Situation, and but a &s;econd-hand Head for
Architecture. I long to &s;ee your Improvements, from tho&s;e I have &s;een
already. Lady LUXBOROUGH has cele|brated you as a De&s;igner very ju&s;tly and
very elegantly.</P>
<P>I have got the Ver&s;es, and wonder you did not communicate them to
me, for they plea&s;e me on two Accounts, yours and Lady LUX|BOROUGH's. I dare
&s;ay it would have given me double Plea&s;ure, to have received a Letter from
you by the Hand you propo&s;ed. I am much obliged to you for your kind
Inten|tion, and think my&s;elf unhappy I was not in <HI>London</HI> on that
Account. Now, though I cannot a&s;k the Favour with any Propriety, yet, give me
Leave to &s;ay, how glad I &s;hould be to &s;ee you at <HI>Whitchurch</HI> this
Summer; and whenever I have that Plea&s;ure, I beg you <PB N="163" REF="181">
will let me know before-hand, for fear of Ac|cidents. As for my Part, I
re&s;olve to wait on you at the <HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> as &s;oon as ever it is in
my Power to do it.</P>
<P>I have one Piece of News to tell you, which mo&s;t likely you have
heard by Mr. GRAVES, which is, that my Brother and Mrs. H&mdash;S are married.
I think they are very likely to be happy. I had rather have a Relation than a
Friend married, for the la&s;t is always en|tirely lo&s;t. You have the
Compliments of all this Place. But my own I &s;hall always &s;epa|rate from the

<DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 31, 1751.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>APologies between Friends appear &s;o un|nece&s;&s;ary, that if you
have &s;till the &s;ame Inclination which you have formerly &s;hewn to look
upon me in that Light, you will never again treat me with the Ceremony of a
for|mal Acquaintance; when you write to me, you give me Plea&s;ure; when you do
not, I love my own Peace two well to fancy you are angry with me, while I am
not con&s;cious of my de&s;erving to have you &s;o. You &s;ee I do not regulate
my Corre&s;pondence as poor Lady &mdash; did her Vi&s;its; which &s;he never
was to return &s;ooner than her former ones had been repaid.</P>
<P>I am not in the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed that you were plea&s;ed to
return to the venerable Seat of your <PB N="165" REF="183"> Ance&s;tors, and
the Abode of your fir&s;t and happie&s;t Days, and find nothing trivial or
chil|di&s;h in the Satisfaction you felt, in &s;eeing old Faces full of
Gratitude for Obligations long &s;ince pa&s;t, and by you, perhaps, forgot; or
in recalling &s;ome little lively Incidents in the earlie&s;t and innocent
Hours of Youth. As for the Wi&s;e and Witty of the pre&s;ent Age, I know not
what they would &s;ay, and I do not de&s;ign to hear it; they will &s;carce
vi&s;it my Hermi|tage, and I &s;hall not leave it to vi&s;it <HI>them.</HI> I
hope to di&s;po&s;e of my Hou&s;e in <HI>Downing-Street,</HI> which I would not
do, if I ever in|tended to pa&s;s &s;ix Weeks in <HI>London,</HI> for I am fond
of the Situation. But I find my&s;elf hap|pie&s;t in the Retreat which my dear
Lord's un|merited Beneficence has made me Mi&s;tre&s;s of, and fixed my Home
upon the Spot of Earth I would have cho&s;e for my&s;elf. Every Thing both
within and without the Hou&s;e reminds me of my Obligations to him; and I
cannot turn my Eyes upon any Object, which is not an Object of his Goodne&s;s
to me. The Satisfac|tion I take in adding either Beauty or Con|venience to my
Habitation, is greatly enhanced by the Reflection, that while I am adorning 
<PB N="166" REF="184"> it, I at the &s;ame Time can &s;hew my Value for the
Gift, and my Gratitude to the lamented Giver.</P>
<P>I have a regular, and, I hope, a religious Family. My Woman, though
&s;he has not lived with me quite three Years, had before lived twenty-three
betwixt Lord GRANTHAM's and Lady COWPER's; my Hou&s;e-keeper has been a Servant
as long; the Per&s;on who takes in my Accounts, pays the Bills, and overlooks
the Men within Doors, has been in the Fami|ly nineteen Years; and the other,
who has lived ten, has the Care of the Stables, and every Thing without. I
ri&s;e at &s;even, but do not go down till nine, when the Bell rings, and my
whole Family meet me at Chapel; after Prayers, we go to Breakfa&s;t; any Friend
who happens to be there, my&s;elf, and my Chap|lain, have ours in the little
Library: the re&s;t in their re&s;pective eating Rooms. About ele|ven, if the
Weather permits, we go to walk in the Park, or take the Air in the Coach: but
if it be too bad for either, we return to our various Occupations. At three we
dine; &s;it perhaps near an Hour afterwards; then &s;e|parate, 
<PB N="167" REF="185"> till we meet at eight for Prayers; af|ter which we
adjourn again to the Library, where &s;omebody reads aloud, unle&s;s &s;ome
Stran|ger comes who chu&s;es Cards, until Half an Hour pa&s;t nine, when we
&s;up, and always part before eleven. This to the fine World would &s;ound a
melancholy mona&s;tic Life; and I cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have cho&s;en it
from my Ignorance of the Splendour and Gaiety of a Court, but from a thorough
Experience that they can give no &s;olid Happine&s;s; and I find my&s;elf more
calmly plea&s;ed in my pre|&s;ent Way of Living, and more truly contented, than
I ever was in the Bloom and Pomp of my Youth. I am no longer dubious what Point
to pur&s;ue. There is but one proper for the Decline of Life, and indeed the
only one worth the Anxiety of a rational Creature at any Age: but how do the
Fire of Youth and Flattery of the World, blind our Eyes, and mi&s;lead our
Fancies, after a Thou&s;and imaginary Plea|&s;ures which are &s;ure to
di&s;appoint us in the End!</P>
<P>I condole with you for the Lo&s;s of Mr. PRICE, as a faithful
Servant is always a va|luable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="186">Mr. SHENSTONE does me a great deal of Honour
in in&s;cribing his Ode upon <HI>Rural Elegance</HI> to me. I am per&s;uaded he
is Ma|&s;ter of the Subject, for I have heard from People who &s;aw his Gardens
not long ago, that they are the mo&s;t perfect Model of it.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, Lady NORTHUMBERLAND did not know how near &s;he was to
you, or &s;he would not have pa&s;&s;ed by, without enquiring after you. The
News-papers will inform you, that her Lord &s;upplies the Place of Lord
WALDGRAVE, in the King's Bed-Chamber. Their Children, I mean the two
younge&s;t, were both here, while they made their <HI>Warwick</HI> and
<HI>Stafford&s;hire</HI> Tour, and al&s;o till they came from <HI>Bath.</HI>
The little Boy is called ALGER|NOON, after his Grand-Papa; and is, though
le&s;s hand&s;ome, the Counterpart of his poor Uncle, Lord BEAUCHAMP; his
Innocence, his Temper, and his Voice, are ju&s;t the &s;ame, and every Motion
of his Body: judge if I am fond of him.</P>
<P>Books you wi&s;h me to name. You have undoubtedly read VOLTAIRE's
<HI>Siecle de Louis,</HI> and <PB N="169" REF="187"> Madame MAINTENON's
<HI>Letters</HI>; I have been entertained with both: he informs the Head;
&s;he, I think, in&s;tructs, and may reform the Heart. I often regret that I
had not &s;een her Writings thirty Years ago. I have &s;een no|thing in the
<HI>Genie</HI> of CECILE, except <HI>la lai|de aimable,</HI> which I think are
pretty. But as for <HI>Jenny Je&s;&s;amy, Betty Barnes,</HI> and their
Compeers, I never buy any of them, though I have looked over the two la&s;t I
have named, in their Pa&s;&s;age between Lady NORTHUMBER|LAND and Mrs. KINGDON.
I hope you will prevail with Mr. SHENSTONE to let me &s;ee his <HI>Ode.</HI>
There are &s;ome Particulars in Arch|bi&s;hop TILLOTSON's Life, that may
amu&s;e you, and a Dialogue upon Beauty, by Sir HARRY BEAUMONT; the&s;e are the

him to give me &s;ome Weeks of his Com|pany. Among&s;t the Strangers who
vi&s;ited my Walks this Summer, there were three or more, as their Servants
informed us, who had re|cour&s;e <PB N="171" REF="189"> to the&s;e
Amu&s;ements, on the Death of their Relations. Perhaps the Sight of an old
Friend is no le&s;s &s;erviceable on &s;uch Occa|&s;ions.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. H&mdash;N,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS can prove no other than an heavy, &s;tupid Letter, agreeable to
the pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition of my Mind. The mo&s;t it can pretend, is to
acquaint you, in vulgar Terms, that you retain your u&s;ual Place in my
Af|fection and E&s;teem; yet this may be no tri|vial Information, now you have
accepted a Place at Court, and have left your Friends at Liberty to form
Conjectures about your future Conduct; to continue, or to di&s;mi&s;s you, as
our Electors do their Repre&s;entatives. Be this as it will, I confe&s;s that I
rechu&s;e you, and wi&s;h that every Court in <HI>Europe</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of
as hone&s;t Men.</P>
<P>You are in the right to decline taking M&mdash;s, if you find the
Scheme too expen&s;ive; and as <PB N="175" REF="193"> he could not have come
into your Service, without purcha&s;ing his Time out from his Ma&s;ter, I
believe it will now be his Point to continue with him till the Expiration of
his Indentures.</P>
<P>I am now in &s;ome Sort of Doubt, con|cerning the Management of my
Snuff-Box; whether to have it repaired in the cheape&s;t Way, with a figured
Tortoi&s;e-Shell on the Top, and a plain Tortoi&s;e-Shell in the Bot|tom; or to
exchange the Gold of it, and have a figured Tortoi&s;e-Shell Box with a gold
Rim, <HI>like yours with a gilt one,</HI> only in the Shape of an oblong
Square, a little rounded at the Corners. I &s;hould have no Thoughts of this,
but that my own &s;eems too little and unmanly. Give me your Opinion &s;oon;
though, if this latter Scheme includes much Expence, pro|ceed with the former,
if you plea&s;e, imme|diately.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire my gold Cla&s;p and Rim may be directly exchanged; I
&s;hall have a new gold Cla&s;p and Rim: perhaps, may enclo&s;e a Pat|tern for
the former, before I &s;eal this Letter. <PB N="176" REF="194">
<HI>Quaere,</HI> therefore, whether the Man, who makes it, will now allow
mo&s;t in the Exchange.</P>
<P>I believe I &s;hall defer the Purcha&s;e of my favourite Wai&s;tcoat
till the Spring. My Vi|&s;itants begin to fail me, (though Sir GEORGE
LYTTELTON, the Dean, and Mr. LYTTELTON, were here ye&s;terday) my Verdure
abandons me, and I have little el&s;e to do, than go to &s;leep for the
Winter.</P>
<P>Pray &s;end me the Ver&s;es on Mi&s;s B&mdash;R, by the honourable
Per&s;onage. As to mine, you may give Copies, if you plea&s;e; but as they are
not fully corrected, I hope whoever has tho&s;e Copies, will take care they be
not printed. I can &s;ay nothing polite at pre&s;ent, &s;o mu&s;t defer my
Acknowledgments to the Ladies at <HI>Wool&s;ton,</HI> till I write to you
again.</P>
<P>Your Letter to Lady LUXBOROUGH was promi&s;ed, &s;o I think you
&s;hould by all Means write, though I confe&s;s it appears to have been rather
too long deferred.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="195">And now having &s;poke to the principal Parts
of your Letter, let me con&s;ider what I have to add.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, your Tenant, old Mr. P&mdash;s, of the Hill-Top, was
carried in a Hear&s;e, through my Grounds, to be buried ye&s;terday. Mr.
I&mdash; has been two or three Days in this Country adju&s;ting Matters with
your Tenants. &mdash;.</P>
<P>C&mdash;Y tells me, you may have your Place &s;up|plied at the
Expence of five Pounds <HI>per</HI> Year. If &s;o, is it not your Point to come
down and live at <HI>Lappal?</HI> I do not herein &s;peak merely for my own
Sake. Sir GEORGE told me ye&s;terday, that he had &s;ecured me BLOOMER'S
Cottage. I &s;aid, I was obliged to him, but did not a&s;k, after what Manner.
He promi&s;ed to come and dine, and &s;tay a Night with me next Year. In the
mean Time, I am beguiled of his dining with me, by <HI>your</HI> venerable
D&mdash;; for having had an Offer from him, from Mr. <PB N="178" REF="196">
LYTTELTON and the Dean, to take a Dinner here this Week, the D&mdash;, through
his great Addre&s;s, conveyed all the&s;e Honours to the <HI>Grange</HI>; and

remon&s;trated upon this to Mr. LYTTELTON, at the <HI>Grange,</HI> in a Manner
pretty forcible, and yet tolera|bly decent. He excu&s;ed for him&s;elf and them

it was not immediately in my Power, from &s;cat|tered Materials, to give it
once more the Form, in which it now appears.</P>
<P>I fear it is no le&s;s requi&s;ite to make an Apology for the
Freedom of in&s;cribing it to your Grace from the Beginning. In this
Re|&s;pect, I have but little to offer, be&s;ide the flattering Imagination,
that the <HI>Subject</HI> might recommend it. It would be no &s;mall Vanity in
me to pre&s;ume, that in Regard to the more elegant Amu&s;ements of a Country
Life, I had <PB N="180" REF="198"> the Honour to entertain the &s;ame
Sentiments with your Grace; however, &s;omething of this Kind I mu&s;t of
Nece&s;&s;ity confe&s;s, if I would give a genuine Account of the Liberty I
have taken.</P>
<P>The additional Fragment was originally in|tended as an Epi&s;ode to
a much larger Poem on the Subject. It was thrown into its pre|&s;ent Form
&s;oon after the Rebellion, and it is now tran&s;cribed, becau&s;e I would not
&s;end a vacant Space in my Paper, wherein I had the mo&s;t di&s;tant Chance of
contributing to your Grace's Amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Lady LUXBOROUGH, who does me the Ho|nour of communicating the&s;e
trifling Produc|tions to your Grace, will not fail to do me the
<HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of declaring the &s;ingular Veneration I have for your
Grace's Character. She will te&s;tify, with how much Diffidence I offer you
&s;uch imperfect Compo&s;itions, written at a Di&s;|tance from every judicious
Friend, with too much Inaccuracy, by the Side of Meadows and Streams, from
which little can be ex|pected, but a Group of rural Allu&s;ions. Above

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF Lady LUXBOROUGH has not been &s;o ju&s;t as to let you know that
&s;he never con|veyed your two excellent Poems to my Hand till la&s;t
<HI>Saturday</HI> Night, you mu&s;t look upon <PB N="182" REF="200"> me as the
mo&s;t ungrateful and ta&s;tele&s;s of all Mortals. I have read them both over
more than once with Plea&s;ure: but will it not ap|pear &s;trange, if I
confe&s;s to you, that the Honour you have done me by the In&s;cription of the
Fir&s;t, and a Stanza or two in the Poem it&s;elf, has given me &s;ome Pain?
And I &s;hall look upon it as a very great Addition to the Favour, if whenever
my Name, or that of <HI>Piercy-Lodge</HI> occurs, you will have the Good|ne&s;s
to fill the Blank (which leaving out tho&s;e Words mu&s;t occa&s;ion) with
Stars, Da&s;hes, or any other Mark you plea&s;e, without &s;u&s;pecting me of
an affected or fal&s;e Mode&s;ty, &s;ince to either of the&s;e Accu&s;ations I
can hone&s;tly plead not guilty. The Idea you have formed of my Character, you
have taken from a partial Friend, who&s;e Good-nature may have (and in this
Ca&s;e certainly has) warped her Judgment. The World in general, &s;ince they
can find no Fault in your Poem, will blame the Choice of the Per&s;on to whom
it is in&s;cribed, and draw mortifying Compari&s;ons betwixt the ideal Lady and
the real one. But I have a more impartial Judge to produce, than either my
Friend or the World, and that is my own <PB N="183" REF="201"> Heart, which
though it may flatter me, I am not quite &s;o faulty as the latter would
repre|&s;ent me, at the &s;ame Time loudly admoni&s;hes me, that I am &s;till
further from the valuable Per&s;on Lady LUXBOROUGH has drawn you in to
&s;uppo&s;e me.</P>
<P>I hope you will accept the&s;e Rea&s;ons as the genuine, and mo&s;t
&s;erious Sentiments of my Mind, which indeed they are, though accom|panied
with the mo&s;t grateful Sen&s;e of the Ho|nour you de&s;igned me.</P>
<P>I cannot help mentioning another Copy of Ver&s;es of yours, which,
if it is not already printed, I hope you will permit Mr. DOD|SLEY to add to his
new Collection, and that is <HI>Damon's Bower,</HI> occa&s;ioned by the Death
of Mr. THOMSON. If you &s;hould have mi&s;|laid the Original, I have a Copy at

have a Mind to look it over again, or tran&s;mit it directly to Mr.

<P>I DID indeed, dear Madam, begin to de|&s;pair of having the Honour,
and (what I felt more &s;en&s;ibly) the Plea&s;ure of hearing from you again. I
am &s;o &s;ubject to fall into Errors, that I was afraid &s;ome unguarded
Expre&s;&s;ion in my la&s;t Letter might have given you Of|fence, and yet my
Heart bore witne&s;s, how far I had been from intending it.</P>
<P>I have been extremely ill the whole Sum|mer, and for &s;ome Weeks
believed in great Danger; but, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God upon Dr. SHAW's
Pre&s;criptions, I am at pre&s;ent, though lean and ill-favoured, much better;
yet &s;till obliged to be carried up and down Stairs, for Want of Strength and
Breath to carry my|&s;elf: but I have great Rea&s;on to ble&s;s God 
<PB N="185" REF="203"> for the Ea&s;e I now enjoy. When one comes to the la&s;t
broken Arches of MIRZA's Bridge, Re&s;t from Pain mu&s;t bound our Ambition,
for Plea&s;ure is not to be expected in this World; where I have no more a
Notion of laying Schemes to be executed &s;ix Months, than I have &s;ix Years
hence; which, I believe, helps to keep my Spirits in an even State of
Chear|fulne&s;s to enjoy the Satisfactions which pre|&s;ent them&s;elves,
without anxious Solicitude about their Duration. We have lived to an Age that
nece&s;&s;arily &s;hews us the Earth crum|bling under our Feet, and as our
Journey &s;eems approaching towards the Verge of Life, is it not more natural
to ca&s;t our Eyes to the Pro&s;pect beyond it, than by a retro&s;pective View,
to recall the trouble&s;ome Trifles that ever made our Road difficult or
dangerous? Methinks it would be imitating LOT's Wife, (who&s;e Hi&s;|tory is
not recorded as an Example for us to follow) to want to look back to the
mi|&s;erable Scene we are &s;o near e&s;caping <HI>from.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;pent the la&s;t three Weeks mo&s;t agree|ably. The fir&s;t
of them, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ox|ford</HI> and Mr. TALBOT, pa&s;&s;ed with us,
and <PB N="186" REF="204"> had the Goodne&s;s to leave Mi&s;s TALBOT (who&s;e
Character I think you mu&s;t have heard) when they went away. She is
<HI>all</HI> the World has &s;aid of her, as to an uncommon Share of
Un|der&s;tanding: but &s;he has other Charms, which I imagine you will join
with me in giving the Preference even to that; a mild and equal Temper, an
unaffected pious Heart, and the mo&s;t univer&s;al Good-will to her
Fellow-Crea|tures, that I ever knew. She cen&s;ures Nobody, &s;he de&s;pi&s;es
Nobody, and whil&s;t her own Life is a Pattern of Goodne&s;s, &s;he does not
ex|claim with Bitterne&s;s again&s;t Vice. We &s;pent a good deal of our Time
in our own Rooms, except in the Mornings, but our Time is a good deal broken in
upon. Soon after nine we meet in the Chapel; as &s;oon as Prayers are over, we
go to Breakfa&s;t, and after that we work, during which, Mr. COWSLAD, or my
Chaplain, read aloud; at eleven we go, if the Weather is tolerable, to take the
Air for two Hours at lea&s;t, which Dr. SHAW in&s;i&s;ts upon my doing. The
Moment we get out of the Coach, we &s;ee no more of one another till three,
when the Dinner is punctually upon the Table. Dinner and Tea are both over 
<PB N="187" REF="205"> by five, when we retire till eight, and then go to
Prayers; after which we adjourn into the little Library, where we work, and the
Gen|tlemen read, as in the Morning, till Supper, a Quarter before ten, and it
is a Rule to be all in our Rooms a Quarter before eleven.</P>
<P>We are at pre&s;ent very highly entertained with the <HI>Hi&s;tory
of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on,</HI> which is &s;o va&s;tly above <HI>Pamela</HI>
or <HI>Clari&s;&s;a,</HI> that I &s;hall not be ea&s;y till you have read it,
and &s;ent me your Sentiments upon it. Mi&s;s TAL|BOT received Lady GRAY's
[<HI>Somewhat omitted, perhaps &s;ome Remarks on Grandi&s;on</HI>] in a Let|ter
of &s;ix Sides, wrote with the greate&s;t good Sen&s;e and Vivacity imaginable.
I fancy &s;he is an excellent and agreeable young Woman.</P>
<P>It is now more than Time to return you Thanks for the Trouble you
have taken in conveying Mr. SHENSTONE's admirable Poem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rural Elegance,</HI> in&s;cribed to the Writer of this

&s;ooner, becau&s;e his Letter was only dated <HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> and I could
not find out his Po&s;t-Town, without &s;ending to Mrs. STANLEY, whom I do not
vi&s;it, and who <PB N="188" REF="206"> lives twelve Miles from me. I have
expre&s;&s;ed my Gratitude in the be&s;t Manner I am able; but am under the
Nec&s;&s;ity of declining the Honour he intended me, and have begged him to
fill up the Blanks with Stars, or what he plea&s;es, whenever my Name, or that
of <HI>Pier|cy-Lodge</HI> was de&s;igned, and I hope he will oblige me.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, you have been in a Lethargy. Dear Madam, this mu&s;t have
proceeded from &s;ome Oppre&s;&s;ion upon your Spirits, for which I have known
Tar-Water to be a &s;overeign Remedy, and wi&s;h you would try it. Poor Mrs.

<DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 29, 1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. IAGO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM at a Lo&s;s how to begin this Letter. I will not, however, in
the u&s;ual Way, give you a tedious Li&s;t of Apologies in the Front of it.
Some Account of my Silence you will find di&s;per&s;ed throughout the Letter,
and as for what is deficient, I will depend up|on your Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>There has not been a Per&s;on here &s;ince you left me, of whom I
could obtain the lea&s;t Intelligence concerning you; and as an Enquiry by the
Po&s;t was my only obvious Method, and as I both owed and promi&s;ed you a
Letter at Parting, I do acknowledge my|&s;elf to blame, notwith&s;tanding all
the Excu&s;es I can make.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="208">Amid&s;t all that Conflux of Vi&s;itants whom
I received this la&s;t Sea&s;on, I was hardly once <HI>&s;o</HI> happy as I was
in <HI>your</HI> Company: I was the happier in &s;eeing you &s;o, and if you
re|member, I took Notice at the Time, how little your Vivacity was impaired, in
compa|ri&s;on of mine. If I was then but a &s;orry Companion, it was not
Solitude and Winter that could make me a better <HI>Corre&s;pondent.</HI> That
Gaiety and Humour, which you was once &s;o partial as to di&s;cover in my
Letters, will hardly appear again there, even to the Eyes of my mo&s;t partial
Friend; at lea&s;t, they will not enliven any Letter that I write in Winter.
Yet Friend&s;hip &s;till remains; Friend|&s;hip, like the Root of &s;ome
perennial Flower, perhaps even then gathers Strength in Secret, that it may
produce a better Di&s;play of its Colours in the Spring.</P>
<P>This I do not pretend to be an adequate Apology. I know, my
deare&s;t Friend, that you both like to &s;ee and to hear from me at all Times;
but it proves that you have no <HI>great</HI> Lo&s;s, either of my Letters or
my Company.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="209">I am, as the Phra&s;e is, deeply penetrated by
the Civility of your Neighbour, Mr. MIL|LER. He took a &s;hort Dinner with me
once, dropping Sir GEORGE at Mr. PEARSALL's; he could not have plea&s;ed me
better: he after|wards breakfa&s;ted here, and in general &s;eemed fond of
every Opportunity of bringing good Company to my Hole, the <HI>Lea&s;owes.</HI>
Do you think that <HI>Radway</HI> or that <HI>Harbury</HI> have no Attractions
for me? You know me too well to imagine it&mdash;But I truly am not well enough
to dare to be from Home. Friends will &s;ay, 
<Q REND="inline">"You may be as free at my Hou&s;e as at your
own,"</Q> and they will mean what they &s;ay. But what is this to the
Purpo&s;e, if you can|not make your&s;elf &s;o?</P>
<P>I cannot pretend to give you a Detail of what pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince I
&s;aw you. Lord D&mdash; with my&s;elf made one Vi&s;it to <HI>Hewell.</HI> I
will not &s;ay, that his Lord&s;hip only, for I al&s;o was received in the
polite&s;t Manner imaginable. We met Mr. and Mrs. WINNINGTON. We took a Trip to
Mr. VERNON's, where we met al&s;o Mr. COVENTRY, and a deal of other 
<PB N="192" REF="210"> Company. All this would afford Subject for
Conver&s;ation betwixt you and me, but I mu&s;t not u&s;e &s;o much of my Paper
to this Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Lord P&mdash;'s Piece of Water &s;hould have been only a large
Serpentine Stream. I can give you many Rea&s;ons. I think him &s;uch a Sort of
Character, as may <HI>&s;hine</HI> in Company upon growing older; he is, and
mu&s;t be beloved already: he has been here once &s;ince, and talks of
cau&s;ing me to come and de&s;ign for him in his Park. The Plan for the Hou&s;e
is right, &s;uppo&s;ing it right to continue it. His Park may have many
Beauties. I hope &s;ome time to meet <HI>you</HI> there.</P>
<P>My Ode after long Delay has been &s;ent to the Duche&s;s of
SOMERSET. It has produced me two genteel Letters from her Grace, and I am
plea&s;ed with the Event, for &s;ome Rea|&s;ons which I could mention.</P>
<P>Soon after this, DODSLEY a&s;ked me to con|tribute to a fourth
Volume of his Mi&s;cellanies. I meant at fir&s;t to do &s;o pretty largely; but
I <PB N="193" REF="211"> afterwards changed my Mind, and determined to &s;end
only little Pieces. I did &s;end him &s;e|veral of my own, &s;ome of my Friends
WHIST|LER, and GRAVES, and &s;ome accidental Pieces of yours, which lay in my
Drawer. I meant to &s;end &s;omething of yours of my own Accord, if I was
hurried, otherwi&s;e not without ap|plying for Con&s;ent. He wrote me word,
la&s;t Week, that his Publication mu&s;t be deferred, upon Account of the
Elections, &s;o that we &s;hall now have Time enough to meet or write upon the
Subject. What I purpo&s;ed was your <HI>Linnets,</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"I owe, &amp;c."</Q> Dick G&mdash;s &s;ent me the
inclo&s;ed little comical Fable; I made &s;ome few Alterations, and put it into
DODSLEY's Hands. Be &s;o good as to return it, as I have now no other Copy.</P>
<P>Some Corre&s;pondence I have had this Win|ter with Mr. H&mdash;N,
about Toys and Trinkets, which he gets done for me in <HI>London.</HI> He is by
far a better Friend and Corre&s;pondent than a Poet. Should you take a Trip to
Town, he would be quite <HI>proud</HI> to &s;ee you.</P>

<P>FEW People can boa&s;t a greater Sen&s;ibi|lity of the Obligations
conferred upon them than my&s;elf, and few are, I believe, le&s;s able to repay
them: but that I may not ap|pear quite defective in both, I will endeavour to
&s;end you a long, though not a very ele|gant Epi&s;tle, in return for the many
obliging ones you have favoured me with.</P>
<P>My Spirits, like yours, have a Tendency towards Retirement, and
whatever brings them into violent Action, is &s;ure to de&s;troy them. No
le&s;s than ten or twelve Per&s;ons in different Parts of the Town, who are
lately arrived from the Country, have I been obliged to at|tend to one Place or
another, which, with my own Affairs likewi&s;e, have often made we wi&s;h to
dwell where no one &s;hould find me out for <PB N="198" REF="216"> &s;even
Years to come. Mr. B&mdash;H was one of my Vi&s;itors, and brought great
Complaints from SAPPHO, and the Ladies at <HI>W&mdash;n,</HI> again&s;t me, for
not writing according to Promi&s;e; I have wrote her a very penitential Letter
of two Sheets, which I hope will make an At|tonement, and produce an An&s;wer.
Thus far have I wrote a Week ago, and by many Oc|currences have been prevented
fini&s;hing my Letter till this Day, when I received yours of the twelfth
Current, to which, as well as your former Epi&s;tles, I will &s;crawl forth
&s;ome Things by Way of An&s;wer.</P>
<P>I have at la&s;t got (after having two returned) a gold Pencil
Ca&s;e made to my Mind for you, which with the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Pebble, and
&s;ome Im|pre&s;&s;ions of my Seals, I packed up in a Box, and carried them
my&s;elf to the <HI>White-Hor&s;e,</HI> in <HI>Friday-Street,</HI> la&s;t
<HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> in Order to go by ROWLEY's Waggon, but he was gone be|fore
I arrived there; which induced me to leave the Box (packed up in blue Paper,
and &s;ealed with my Arms) in the Hands of the Wo|man of the Hou&s;e, who
promi&s;ed her&s;elf to deliver it to-day to old DANKS, and hope you 
<PB N="199" REF="217"> will receive it &s;afe &s;ome-time next Week. The Pebble
I was obliged to return, for I did not think it was made concave and convex
enough; it is not quite as I would have it, however, it is as well as I can
procure it, and if it plea&s;es you, it will plea&s;e me of cour&s;e. I &s;aw a
beautiful Onyx at the Lapidary's, eight Inches long or more, and four broad, it
was to be cut for an Etwee. I have bought a Sheet of China Paper, pink Colour,
bigger than this, for one Shilling and Six-pence, and &s;ome few Prints, a new
Pair of fine &s;ilver Buckles, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If I could be a&s;toni&s;hed at any Thing, it would be at the
Perplexity and Delay of the Law; and to compleat my Amazement, my Attorney has
pre&s;ented me with a Bill of Co&s;ts of more than two hundred Pounds.
Po&s;itively I will leave <HI>London.</HI> My Scheme is this; to board at

can rank my&s;elf a Degree above the <PB N="201" REF="219"> verie&s;t Boor in
the Country; and when I come down, I &s;hall put a quick Stop to all the
in|tended Vi&s;its from all the <HI>Jack-a-Nokes</HI>'s and
<HI>Tom-a-Stiles</HI> of <HI>Hales-Owen,</HI> even though that double-faced
<HI>Janus</HI> you mention were at the Head of them, peeping in at both Doors
at once. I ab&s;olutely have laughed very heartily this Afternoon, at your odd
Account of the old Cur, whom I &s;hould take great Plea&s;ure to mortify, or
even to mar, for he can never be mended before the D&mdash;l has him.</P>
<P>I fear your Anger again&s;t me is at this Hour, (pa&s;t eight at
Night) at a Cri&s;is; another very pe&s;tilent Fit will ari&s;e, wor&s;e than
the former on <HI>Monday,</HI> which I progno&s;ticate will go off at the
&s;ame Time, the very In&s;tant you read this Part in my Letter. Am not I
<HI>very</HI> vain, to think you can &s;o <HI>very</HI> ea&s;ily forgive me; I
fear you will have more Rea&s;on to find Fault with me in the Country, when I
&s;hall be &s;o much nearer to you then than I am now. I do not fi&s;h for a
Compliment, when I &s;ay, I have many dark Spots for a few white ones: but I
flatter my&s;elf, you will have the Good|ne&s;s to bear with my Foibles, more
than any <PB N="202" REF="220"> body el&s;e. Be not angry at me for not
en|clo&s;ing this to Lord D&mdash;Y. I write &s;o of|ten there, and &s;o
&s;eldom have an&s;wers, that I fear his Lord&s;hip will think I make too free
with him: I de&s;ired a few Franks a while ago, but have heard nothing
concerning them; however, do make my re&s;pectful Compliments at the
<HI>Grange,</HI> when you go there. I hear that Mi&s;s DOLMAN and Mi&s;s
MILLWARD are in <HI>London</HI>; the former I have not &s;een, and the latter I
am unacquainted with.</P>
<P>I lately contracted &s;ome Acquaintance with a Gentleman who is a
great Virtuo&s;o, he is a F. R. S. and has a very fine Collection both of
Medals and Fo&s;&s;ils, e&s;pecially the latter, which he is willing to
increa&s;e, at the Ex|pence of the former. I told him of the <HI>Dud|ley</HI>
Lime-Pitts; he &s;hewed me &s;ome Fo&s;&s;ils, like tho&s;e you gave me from
thence; begs me to procure him all I could lay my Hands upon, and he would
exchange Medals for them. I &s;hould be obliged to you, if you meet with any
more, to re&s;erve them till I come down, and in the next to inform me, if you
are like|ly to procure any for me, as I have promi&s;ed <PB N="203" REF="221">
the Gentleman to vi&s;it him again &s;oon: you mu&s;t not let the
<HI>D&mdash;y</HI> Fellow impo&s;e upon you, he is ignorant, though impudent.
The Gentleman's Name is B&mdash;E, of <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Pa|rents: I bought
&s;ome &s;ilver Coins of him very cheap. I &s;aw the famous Mr. A. POND at his
Hou&s;e in the City, who had a Diamond on his Finger, which I think out&s;hone
the D&mdash; of E&mdash;'s, who I find is, as a F. R. S. an Acquaintance of
theirs. The D&mdash;n is gone to <HI>E&mdash;r.</HI></P>
<P>What to &s;ay concerning Mi&s;s &mdash; I know not! All has been
done, and &s;aid, and thought of, by all of us that could be. I pity her for
her Mother's, as well as for her own Sake, and &s;hould be &s;orry to have her
Mother think her incapable of going into the World; I do a&s;&s;ure you, (under
the Veil of Secrecy) &s;he is too giddy, young and thoughtle&s;s, as well as
proud, to know her own Intere&s;t, or even, knowing it, to pur&s;ue it. A young
Lady will not bear with her; and it would be &s;omewhat difficult to introduce
her to one of middle Age, who would &s;trictly keep her under her Eye, and
improve her by Advice and In&s;truc|tion <PB N="204" REF="222"> more than
Command; for &s;he has at School a great deal of Work to very little Book,
which I am certain makes her, at her lei&s;ure Hours, fly to Amu&s;ement rather
than Study. Do not mention this to Mrs. R. I will talk to Mrs. B&mdash;
concerning her.</P>

<P>MY la&s;t Letter will reach your Hands this Evening; it will be very

at the Expence of po&s;tponing many other affairs; but the me|lancholy

<P>Poor Mi&s;s D&mdash; expired ye&s;terday Morning at three o'Clock;
Dr. B&mdash; and Mr. S&mdash; were called up to no Purpo&s;e. Mi&s;s M&mdash;
fell into violent Hy&s;terics, and is now very indifferent. What &s;ad
Cata&s;trophes oftentimes attend the mo&s;t de&s;irable and innocent

Body of her Acquaintance mu&s;t regret the Lo&s;s of her.</P>
<P>I &s;aw Mr. CRAWLEY to-day, who enquired after your Health, &amp;c.
de&s;iring his Compli|ments <PB N="206" REF="224"> to you. I am by him
informed, that Mi&s;s L&mdash; is one of Mr. W&mdash;'s Executors, and will
inherit great Part of his Fortune; tho' the Will has a Caveat lodged again&s;t

hope will render her inde|pendent of the World. Pray do you know whether Lord

taken another Lod|ging, but &s;hall not go to it till the Middle of next Month;
and even then would have you direct your Letters here as u&s;ual. I ne|ver
&s;hall like another Lodging &s;o well as I do this.</P>
<P>My Brother, who is my principal Witne&s;s, is to come up; in

<HEAD>LETTER LIV. Mr. H&mdash; to W. SHENSTONE, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Really compa&s;&s;ionate your Sufferings, both of Body as well as
Mind, the former (the Tooth-ach I mean) may perhaps &s;oon be re|medied, the
latter, I fear, mu&s;t be effected by Time, But it is needle&s;s, as well as
imper|tinent, in me to moralize to you upon this, or any other unavoidable
Misfortune, who know how to reconcile the &s;eeming Contradictions in the
Decrees of Providence, and to &s;ubmit to them in a better Manner than People
of weak|er Judgments than your&s;elf can. Let me have the Plea&s;ure, my dear
Friend, to find your Spirits unbroken by this Shock, and endeavour to &s;hake
off the Melancholy you are too &s;ub|ject to indulge, to the Prejudice of your
Health, when Accidents like this, or &s;ometimes le&s;s, befal you. I have not
&s;een Mr. C&mdash;, (nor can I till <HI>Thur&s;day)</HI> therefore do not
pretend to &s;end <PB N="211" REF="229"> you any more Particulars, relating to
the un|welcome News you have received. I beg, if you would have me think you
well, to let me hear from you immediately.</P>
<P>I am extremely plea&s;ed with your Argument upon Enmity and Revenge;
it is my own Way of thinking, yet I often lament, that I am compelled to act
contrary to it, in the Pro&s;e|cution of my Law-Suit again&s;t &mdash;, the
faithle&s;s Guardian of my younger Days and &s;hattered Fortune. <HI>If any Man
will take my Coat, I mu&s;t give him my Cloak al&s;o.</HI> This is very
&s;elf-denying Doctrine, and what I &s;carce think was intended to be literally
accepted. I have been the&s;e three Days pa&s;t attending on my Attorney, about
&s;ettling &s;ome di&s;agreeable Truths relating to my Cau&s;e; and greatly
wronged as I am, I would forgive the Author of my Evils, if he would re&s;tore
what he un|ju&s;tly detains from me, and bani&s;h him&s;elf from my Knowledge,
without calling him to Ac|count for what his Extravagancy has hitherto robbed
me of; this I fear he will not do, and Self-pre&s;ervation will compel me to
take all Advantages I can.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="230">I am greatly concerned to think, I &s;hall not
be able to come down before the End of Summer. I will write to Mr. I&mdash;, to

meets him at <HI>Birmingham</HI>; am much obliged to you, for the Trouble you
already have had, and &s;till offer to undertake to &s;erve me.</P>
<P>As I am in great Expectations my Cau&s;e will be determined this

<HEAD>LETTER LV. Mr. H&mdash; to W. SHENSTONE, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Should not have let two Po&s;ts &s;lip away &s;ince I received
your la&s;t Letter, dated the 6th In&s;tant, could I have avoided &s;uch an
Omi&s;&s;ion; I will give my Rea&s;ons for &s;o doing before I end my
Letter.</P>
<P>When I reflect upon the melancholy Situa|tion of Mind you labour
under, I think I &s;hould not indulge it. It is offering an una|vailable
Sacrifice to an irremediable Misfortune. I can &s;ympathize with my Friend, and
partake of his Grief, yet it is not, I believe, any Im|peachment of a
compa&s;&s;ionate Temper, to en|deavour to remove tho&s;e Ideas from the Mind
(if they impair the Health of the Sufferer) which are too violent for it; even
though the Object were (if po&s;&s;ible) more meritorious than the
greatly-lamented Lady who was &s;o <PB N="214" REF="232"> &s;uddenly hurried
from us: however, while this Cata&s;trophe is &s;o recent, I may venture to
write upon a Subject which I hope Time will draw the Veil over, though not
totally efface; you expect it from me; yet I know few Par|ticulars that have
not very probably reached your Ears by other Hands. I purpo&s;ely avoid|ed
going to Mr. C&mdash;'s, by Rea&s;on of the great Confu&s;ion they were in,
till the Middle of this Week, when I called, and paid the Thanks you de&s;ired,
both to that Family and Dr. B&mdash;, for their Care and Attendance. Mrs.
C&mdash;'s little Girl was &s;ent out of the Way, and is not permitted to come
Home yet; &s;he has been &s;o ill her&s;elf, that it was feared &s;he would
have mi&s;carried, but is now better. Mi&s;s M&mdash;D came into the Room while
I was there, and a&s;ked much after you and Mr. D&mdash;, whom &s;he was glad
to hear was gone to D&mdash;'s. She de&s;ired me to remember her Compliments
when I wrote to you, and &s;hould be glad to hear how you were in Health. I
thought &s;he looked a little Wild, and was fearful of mentioning any Thing
that might di&s;order her again; they tell me, &s;he is, in a Manner, quite
well, for when &s;he was at the wor&s;t, <HI>Ophelia</HI> in <HI>Ham|let,</HI> 
<PB N="215" REF="233"> Mrs. B&mdash; &s;aid, could not equal her Deli|rium.</P>
<P>Mrs. B&mdash; could &s;carcely refrain her Tears when &s;he &s;poke
upon the Subject, and it gave me great Pain to hear her Detail. She told me,
the Doctor left her at half an Hour pa&s;t ten as well as could be expected. At
three in the Morning, the Nur&s;e went down Stairs; Mi&s;s M&mdash; dropt
a&s;leep, when Mi&s;s S&mdash; perceived the poor Lady &s;truggling to &s;pit,
and though every A&s;&s;i&s;tance was imme|diately at Hand, &s;he expired in
le&s;s than five Minutes. The Doctor returned, Mrs. B&mdash; &s;aid, &s;o
affected, that he did not recover his Spirits for two or three Days afterwards,
and wi&s;hed often, that he had never known her, though every body is well
&s;atisfied with what he did; Mi&s;s M&mdash;, in particular, &s;poke in
Raptures upon the Tenderne&s;s of Conduct, and friendly Affability that
appeared through his whole At|tendance.</P>
<P>I will here put an End to my Narration. I fear I have &s;aid too
much, and am almo&s;t inclined not to &s;end what I have wrote. My 
<PB N="216" REF="234"> Motives for not writing &s;ooner appear on the other
Side; only a di&s;agreeable Hurry you will find.</P>
<P>You may, perhaps, remember me to have mentioned a Relation I had in
<HI>Norfolk,</HI> of my Name, who always was &s;eemingly fond of me, and having
no Children, promi&s;ed to make me his Heir. I was &s;ent for by a Gentleman, a
few days ago, who informed me, he was dead and buried; that his Will was proved
in the Country, the Contents of which he knew nothing of; but that the
Executors have &s;old off all his Effects. I wrote la&s;t <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> to
an Attorney near there, to whom I gave Orders to &s;eek out the Executors, and
&s;end me a Copy of the Will. My Time has been &s;ome|what employed in
&s;eeking what Intelligence I could among&s;t his Acquaintance here, who none
of them had heard of his Death. I ne|ver had any great Rea&s;on to expect any
Thing from this Gentleman; and I think it an Abu&s;e upon a Per&s;on's
Credulity, to amu&s;e and de|ceive one with unmeaning Promi&s;es and fal&s;e
Hopes. If I am di&s;appointed, I will not &s;uf|fer it to grieve me one Moment,
but forget <PB N="217" REF="235"> it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; to which
Purpo&s;e, I will (if Mr. I&mdash; can &s;pare me) come down to the
<HI>Lea&s;owes</HI> for a Week or two, as my Cau&s;e will not come on the&s;e
two Months, I be|lieve.</P>
<P>I do not find that Mr. COVENTRY and Mr. PYTTS are likely to have an
Oppo&s;ition in <HI>Worce|&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> therefore my Appearance will not
&s;erve them much, but only will prove an unnece&s;|&s;ary Expence to my&s;elf.
I have been impor|tuned, by many well-wi&s;hers to me, to congra|tulate Sir
G&mdash; L&mdash; on his new acquired Ho|nour. Where would the Advantage be to
either? I declare I would not (contracted as my For|tune is) willingly accept a
Place of one hun|dred Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> to be confined to one Spot. I
wi&s;h I were once fixed at &s;ome Cer|tainty in the Country, and twice that
Sum &s;hould not move me. I &s;eemingly contradict my&s;elf, but you
under&s;tand my Meaning. <HI>I would not &s;ell my Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>Let me beg you to write to me &s;oon; I hope you will be more
capable of &s;o doing than you were a while ago. Remember me 
<PB N="218" REF="236"> to Lord D&mdash;'s Family, whom I wi&s;h (the better

<P>THE Arrival of your Servant gave me a retro&s;pective View of my own
intolera|ble Omi&s;&s;ions, and oppre&s;&s;ed me with &s;ome|what like the Load
of an evil Con&s;cience. I mu&s;t allow that Appearances make again&s;t me; and

for Mr. D&mdash;, a deeper Sen&s;e of his Civilities, a greater Re|li&s;h for
his Company, or a more lively De|&s;ire to partake of tho&s;e Beauties which he
is daily di&s;tributing round his Situation. Of the&s;e la&s;t, Mi&s;s F&mdash;
F&mdash; has &s;ometimes favoured me <PB N="220" REF="238"> with the greate&s;t
Encomiums: I am &s;ure &s;he knew how much I &s;hould enjoy them, and might
al&s;o mean them as Inducements (which I never yet wanted) to ha&s;ten the
Vi&s;it I in|tended you at <HI>W&mdash;.</HI> Alas! neither her Plea|&s;ure in
giving me the&s;e De&s;criptions, nor mine in receiving them, were unmixed with
Pain; as &s;he was too often forced to adjoin but an indifferent Account of
poor Mi&s;s D&mdash;'s Health. For this, and for the Affliction it occa&s;ions
you and Mrs. D&mdash;, I really feel a Concern that I am not &s;atisfied to
expre&s;s in the ordinary Forms of Condolence.</P>
<P>I have pa&s;&s;ed this Summer in a Series of Di&s;&s;ipation;
betwixt &s;ome Events di&s;agreeable enough, and others that wear at lea&s;t
the Ap|pearance of Plea&s;ure. I have done (what <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t call) a good
deal round my Place. Com|pany produced new Operations, and new Ope|rations
produced almo&s;t daily Company. The Line of my Path is now almo&s;t
univer&s;ally ex|tended to the Sides of Hedges, and, together with &s;ome
&s;lighter Improvements, have been added two new Ca&s;cades: of the fir&s;t of
the&s;e, I believe you have heard &s;ome Account; it is <PB N="221" REF="239">
really, if you'll pardon &s;uch an Expre&s;&s;ion from the Proprietor, a very
<HI>great</HI> Thing for the <HI>Size</HI> of it.</P>
<P>My Servant has been <HI>weekly</HI> upon the Point of &s;etting out
for <HI>D&mdash;</HI> Hou&s;e, ever &s;ince the Time I fir&s;t heard of your
Return to it: but as he is here much le&s;s of the Footman or Groom, than the
River-God, he has been al|mo&s;t continually called upon to unlock and conduct
his Rivulets; for this Fortnight, in|deed, or three Weeks la&s;t, he has been
le&s;s importuned on that Score; but then, during that Space, arrived a
Vi&s;itant, who is now with me in the Hou&s;e, and, till the Time of who&s;e
Departure was a&s;certained, I was unable to fix a Day when I could wait upon
you and Mrs. D&mdash;: I hope to do &s;o about the Mid|dle of next Week; and
will not fail to &s;end TOM over upon <HI>Monday</HI> or <HI>Tue&s;day.</HI> If
he can be of any po&s;&s;ible Service, in Regard to the Ca&s;cades you

<OPENER><DATELINE>The <HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 27, 1755.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND it nece&s;&s;ary to write to your Lady|&s;hip this Week, not
being able to endure that you &s;hould think hardly of me, during the Time that
may elap&s;e before I can po&s;&s;i|bly &s;ee you. When I have the Honour of
doing &s;o, I tru&s;t that I can era&s;e any unfa|vourable Impre&s;&s;ions, and
very fairly acquit my&s;elf of all voluntary Neglect; meantime, let me only
beg, that you would &s;u&s;pend your Accu&s;ation. I wi&s;h I could fix a Time
for the Performance of this Vi&s;it, but it is not in my Power: &s;uch Weather
as the pre&s;ent does not only numb ones Limbs, but extends its Severity to our
Projects, Hopes and Re&s;o|lutions. Your Lady&s;hip well knows how Win|ter
affects <HI>me</HI>; and have indeed your&s;elf re|marked it in the very Style
of my Letters. <PB N="224" REF="242"> I am dull enough to be unworthy of a
Con|ver&s;ation much inferior to yours; and if I add, that I am a little
peevi&s;h withal, I &s;hall do my&s;elf no Inju&s;tice. Were it then
po&s;&s;i|ble to retain the &s;ame venomous or torpid Qualities, when arrived
upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bar|rels,</HI> I ought in common Policy to confine
my&s;elf at Home: but I have been, and am confined upon a different Score, a
Kind of Partition-treaty with Ma&s;ter D&mdash;, and when this is concluded or
broken off, as I tru&s;t will &s;oon be the Ca&s;e, I &s;hall not then draw
Excu&s;es from the Stupidity with which it is my Fate to be <HI>vi&s;ited</HI>
in Winter. I have, indeed, &s;ome|times imagined, that I brightened up in your
Company, when I had before e&s;teemed it as impo&s;&s;ible as that you &s;hould
poli&s;h a Piece of Cinder or of Spunge.</P>
<P>I have expected to &s;ee DODSLEY's Mi&s;cellany adverti&s;ed &s;ix
Weeks ago. Had he allowed me but one Half of this Time to deliberate, I could
have adju&s;ted the Share we have of it much more to my own Satisfaction. I
know but little what he has done, in Con&s;equence of that di&s;cretionary
Power, with which, through <PB N="225" REF="243"> mere Ha&s;te, I was obliged
to intru&s;t him; and this po&s;&s;ibly at a Time when his own Hurry was as
great as mine. But this I know, that in all I did my&s;elf, you may expect to
trace the Finger of Stupidity precipitated.</P>
<P>Stupidity, however, is many an hone&s;t Man's Lot; Pre&s;umption is
le&s;s excu&s;able; and it is with the utmo&s;t Humility, that I beg your
La|dy&s;hip's Pardon for the Liberty I took in pro|po&s;ing what I thought
might be an Improvement of your Ver&s;es. I have only this to plead, that you
write the&s;e lively Pieces almo&s;t extempore; that you lay no Stre&s;s upon
them, and &s;carce ever revi&s;e them; that, on the&s;e Accounts only, I
thought it po&s;&s;ible an Expre&s;&s;ion not altogether exact might here and
there e&s;cape you; that finding my Propo&s;als di&s;approved, I did all my
<HI>Time</HI> would allow, to cau&s;e DOD|SLEY to have Recour&s;e to your
original Rea|dings; and if he <HI>have</HI> not done &s;o univer&s;ally, (as I
apprehend may be the Ca&s;e) tho&s;e Rea|dings may be re&s;tored in any future
Impre&s;|&s;ion. I will re&s;ume the Subject on &s;ome other Occa&s;ion; at
pre&s;ent let me only mention, that DODSLEY, when he wrote to me la&s;t,
de&s;ired my <PB N="226" REF="244"> Opinion, whether or no he &s;hould be
thought impertinent if he pre&s;ented your Lady&s;hip with a complete Set of
his Mi&s;cellanies. It &s;eems the three fir&s;t Volumes are out of Print at
this Time; but will be reprinted in about a Month: the fourth he gives me
Rea&s;on to ex|pect every Day.</P>
<P>I am particularly glad to hear that your Health is tolerable, during
this rigorous Wea|ther, as it gives me Room to conceive the Ad|vantage you may
derive from a better. How do I long for the Approach of Spring! Me|thinks I
could travel Leagues to meet it, were it po&s;&s;ible by &s;o doing to bring it
fa&s;ter on its Way: and yet, unle&s;s it &s;hould &s;upply me with Health, as
well as with Company, with Spirits, as well as Spring-Flowers, and in one Word,
enliven both the Farmer, and the Farm, what would it avail? The two Ca|nary
Birds that were given me about three Weeks ago &s;ing whil&s;t I am writing;
&s;ing from Morn to Night, and that with all the Vigour which the Spring
it&s;elf could in&s;pire; yet I do not half enjoy them; my Mind is not in tune:

<DATE><HI>March</HI> 21, 1755.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. GRAVES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PARDON the Arrival of this one more Letter without a Frank; I have
&s;ent &s;ome Covers to my Lord of <HI>D&mdash;,</HI> who is down, and &s;hall
probably enough receive them before I write again.</P>
<P>There is nothing that I can le&s;s forgive the World than your Want
of Lei&s;ure. Do not mi&s;interpret me, or take ami&s;s what I &s;ay. I know
you to be infinitely more happy than <PB N="228" REF="246"> my&s;elf, who am
cloyed with it: but it would add &s;omething to my Happine&s;s, if not to your
own, that you had more vacant Spaces or Intervals of Time to employ in tho&s;e
re|fined Amu&s;ements, for which you are &s;o ex|qui&s;itely qualified.</P>
<P>I am in doubt, whether I &s;hould add Mot|tos to my Seal, or not
rather cau&s;e the Circum|ference, which at pre&s;ent is rather of the
large&s;t, to be contracted. Should you have &s;truck out any Thing &s;ince you
wrote to me, you will be &s;o good as to let me know.</P>
<P>As to Sun-Dials, I never much affected the Things them&s;elves, nor
indeed any Mottos with which I have &s;een them in&s;cribed; perhaps this
Indifference may ari&s;e from no very com|mendable Sources, a Reflection upon
my own Want of Proficiency in Mathematics, and an habitual Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of my own Wa&s;te of Time. However, I have often had Thoughts of placing a
&s;light one &s;omewhere upon my Premi&s;es, for the Sake of in&s;cribing it
with a Couple of Lines from VIRGIL: 
<Q><PB N="229" REF="247"> 
<L>Sed fugit interea fugit, irreparabile tempus,</L> 
<L>Singula dum capti circumvectamur amore.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IMITATED. 
<Q> 
<L>Meantime the Hours, th' irreparable Hours,</L> 
<L>Wing their &s;wift Flight, while Streams, and rural
Bow'rs,</L> 
<L>And Love engage the Mind.</L></Q></NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>All</HI> the Lines in VIRGIL afford me that Sort of Plea&s;ure
which one receives from melancho|ly Mu&s;ic; and I believe I am often &s;truck
with the Turn and Harmony of his Expre&s;|&s;ion, where a Per&s;on le&s;s
attached to the&s;e can di&s;cover no great Beauty.</P>
<P>I told you, how much I was vexed that DODSLEY did not &s;uffer me to
avail my&s;elf of the Time that pa&s;&s;ed from the Correction of the
Proof-Sheets to the Publication of his Book. He has at la&s;t &s;ent me a Copy,
which I received la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Se'en-night. I wi&s;h the la&s;t
Stanza of WHISTLER's Ver&s;es upon Flowers had remained as he him&s;elf wrote
it: but being &s;omewhat di&s;&s;atisfied with the ori|ginal Reading, and
having no Time left to improve it my&s;elf, I left it to D&mdash;, who I think
has made it wor&s;e; however, in this Re&s;pect, and &s;ome others, it may be
proper to <PB N="230" REF="248"> fix one's Eye upon a &s;ub&s;equent
Impre&s;&s;ion; and DODSLEY has acted as di&s;creetly as it was po&s;&s;ible
for him to do, con&s;idering what In|&s;tructions were given him, and how
<HI>much</HI> was left to his Di&s;cretion. Our Contributions may be &s;aid to
begin with Mr. SOMERVILLE's <HI>Ad|dre&s;s, &amp;c.</HI> Page 302; among&s;t
which he has in&s;erted two Odes (Page 305 and 307) to which I am a Stranger.
The Song marked J. S. H. is my Neighbour Mr. H&mdash;'s, who has a pretty
Collection of Drawings, Petrefactions, and Coins. The <HI>Lady of Quality</HI>
you know; and as to all the Pieces that follow, you know the Authors of them as
well as I do. I will not anticipate your own Ob&s;ervations; but I cannot help
remarking that MILTON's <HI>Il Pen|&s;ero&s;o</HI> has drove half our Poets
crazy: it has, however, produced &s;ome admirable Odes to <HI>Fancy,</HI>
among&s;t which, that of WHARTON (not in this Volume) I think de&s;erves the
Prefe|rence; and after his, MERRICK's, PENSHURST, and the Ode on
<HI>Solitude</HI> are of the &s;ame Tribe, and are good. The <HI>Plea&s;ures of
Melancholy,</HI> and MARIOTT's Ode to <HI>Fancy,</HI> of the &s;ame Tribe, are
indifferent. There is nothing I am more plea&s;ed with, than Father FRANCIS's
Prayer, <PB N="231" REF="249"> MRS. BERKLEY repeated it to me in my
Root-Hou&s;e this la&s;t Summer, and, I think, &s;aid it was Mr. WEST's. I
could wi&s;h I had made you &s;ome Compliments in this Volume, for particular
Rea&s;ons, and had re&s;olutely done &s;o, had your own Diffidence permitted
me.</P>
<P>I have now and then &s;ome Thoughts of printing that <HI>Ode to the
Duche&s;s,</HI> together with &s;omething &s;ufficient to make a twelve or an
eighteen-penny Pamphlet, about the Time the Parliament ri&s;es; but not
unle&s;s it &s;its till <HI>June</HI> as was reported, and not unle&s;s you
will pro|mi&s;e me the Favour of your A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>'Tis the Property of great Delicacy, to be often-times too
diffident; po&s;&s;ibly then you may not long per&s;evere in that Manner of
&s;pelling your Name, which you &s;eem at pre&s;ent to prefer; yet is nothing
&s;o clear to me, as that your&s;elf and your Relations &s;hould &s;pell their

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. B&mdash;,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE affectionate Letter I received from you ought to have been
an&s;wered by the next Po&s;t; it had been &s;o, if I had pur&s;ued the
Dictates of a Heart, I will not &s;ay, al|together <PB N="233" REF="251"> happy
in our Reconciliation, but more properly in the Manife&s;tation of our
ever-un|divided Friend&s;hip. I have had a large Con|flux of Vi&s;itants this
Summer, and the Di&s;&s;i|pation they have occa&s;ioned me, was for the mo&s;t
Part very agreeable. But it mu&s;t not be by any Acce&s;&s;ion of
<HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> that I at|tempt to excu&s;e my un&s;ea&s;onable Neglect of
writing; for Plea&s;ure I have in writing to my Friends, when my Mind is free
from Anxiety, and that Plea&s;ure connected with a Duty I owe to Friend&s;hip,
&s;uperior to what is claimable by any mere Vi&s;itant or Acquaintance; yet I
can|not but confe&s;s the Change which a very few Years have wrought in me; for
&s;urely it is not long &s;ince I wearied you, and the re&s;t of my
Corre&s;pondents, with my <HI>A&s;&s;iduity</HI>; where I now write
<HI>one</HI> Letter, I then wrote <HI>twenty:</HI> mean while, the Warmth of my
Heart is not dimini&s;hed, with regard to Friend&s;hip; I know it from the
Plea&s;ure which the Receipt of your Letter gave me. Of this Kind are the only
Plea&s;ures which accompany us through Life; they encrea&s;e upon Repetition,
and grow more lively from Indulgence. 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Vient l'Appetit en mangeant,</HI>"</Q> was, I
think, an An&s;wer made <PB N="234" REF="252"> by a <HI>French</HI> Courtier to
his Sovereign, when it was objected to him by the latter, that there was no End
of his Importunities. But whatever odd In&s;tances may be found of a perverted
Appetite, the Maxim is only univer|&s;al, in regard to &s;ocial Plea&s;ure. The
Ca&s;e is not the &s;ame, with regard to Plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e; it is not &s;o
even with regard to Plea|&s;ures of Imagination. Accordingly, though I fir&s;t
embelli&s;hed my Farm, with an Eye to the Satisfaction I &s;hould receive from
its Beauty, I am now grown dependent upon the Friends it brings me, for the
principal Enjoyment it affords; I am plea&s;ed to find them plea&s;ed, and
enjoy its Beauties by Reflection. And thus the durable Part of my Plea&s;ure
appears to be, at the la&s;t, of the &s;ocial Kind.</P>
<P>With much Willingne&s;s would I have waited upon your Friend Colonel
C&mdash; this Year, but for the perplexing Law-Suit in which I am involved with
young D&mdash;. It has made me rude to my Superiors, deaf to all inviting
Of|fers, and neglectful, at once, to my old Friends and my new. Pray make my
Compliments to him, and a&s;&s;ure him how &s;en&s;ible I am of the 
<PB N="235" REF="253"> Honour he has done me. Another Year, if I live, will, I
hope, make me &s;ome Amends for this, by affording me an Opportunity of
wait|ing upon him and you.</P>
<P>Pray al&s;o make my Compliments to Mr. and Mrs. P&mdash;, and Dr.
C&mdash;, and my Peace with the <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> Family, or any other where
you vi&s;it, that may mi&s;take Nece&s;&s;ity for Di&s;|re&s;pect. Above all,

you will verify it in your Behaviour; neither do I drop <HI>any</HI> of the&s;e
Hints, as though I mi&s;tru&s;ted your Conduct; I do unfeignedly believe them

<SALUTE>My dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER a Journey of above a Month, is it not very rea&s;onable to
allow a Man of my Age, a Month to re&s;t him&s;elf? I have been here indeed
&s;o long; but Vi&s;its, and re|turning Vi&s;its, and Bu&s;ine&s;s, have
prevented mo&s;t of it from being a Time of Re&s;t. I am now &s;et down to
writing Letters, which I ve|rily believe will take up another Month, for, on
ca&s;ting up my Accounts of that Kind, I found my&s;elf no le&s;s than
forty-&s;even in Debt; a Number, for which I am &s;ure you mu&s;t pity me.</P>
<P>I don't know how to thank you enough, for all the Plea&s;ure we had
during the Week we were at the <HI>Lea&s;owes.</HI> I have talked of it every
Day &s;ince, and dream of it a-nights. If you loved travelling as well as I do,
I &s;hould <PB N="239" REF="257"> certainly be&s;eech you to come and &s;tay a
Month or two here at <HI>Durham</HI>; and I &s;hould be the more encouraged to
do &s;o, becau&s;e our Friend Mr. DODSLEY left us quite in love with the Place;
(I don't mean the Town it&s;elf, but the Walks about it.) Indeed, if Wood, and
Water, and Wildne&s;s, are the Things that make a Place agreeable, we are as
mu&s;t obliged to Nature here, and more, than any Town I have ever &s;een,
either at Home or abroad.</P>
<P>My Obligations to you are not confined to <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> and
your delightful Paradi&s;e in it; but &s;pread through all the Counties that we
pa&s;&s;ed; and increa&s;ed, when we had Time to &s;et down here, from your
Works of another Kind; they often gave me the greate&s;t Plea|&s;ure, not only
from their Spirit and Elegance, but from the good Heart that &s;hines forth
throughout them. Whatever Excellencies a Writer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and to
whatever Degree, this is the true Sun, that gives the noble&s;t gild|ing of all
to his Compo&s;itions; and you mu&s;t give me leave to &s;ay, that you are the
mo&s;t &s;un-&s;hiny Writer of this Kind that ever warmed me.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="258">If, in the fir&s;t Month that you can't walk
abroad, you would favour me with the natural Hi&s;tory, how, and why, and in
what Order, you laid out every Part of your Gardens, it would not only be a
Continuation of the Plea|&s;ure you have given me ever &s;ince I &s;aw you, but
would be, I dare &s;ay, of particular U&s;e to me, as a Guide and
A&s;&s;i&s;tant in many Things, and particularly in tho&s;e two great Articles
of Vi&s;tos and Ca&s;cades. What I wrote down, was a mere Skeleton of the
Ground, and was only intended to enable me to take all the Round of it,
whenever I &s;hould want to do &s;o, in my Imagination; but what I would beg of
you, is, a more lively Account of a Place, that is &s;o much mine and every
Body's Fa|vourite.</P>
<P>I went from you to <HI>Scotland,</HI> as I fear too many People do,
with an Expectation of &s;carce &s;eeing any Thing there worth &s;eeing: but
after pa&s;&s;ing above one hundred Miles of it, through bad Roads, over
Mountains, by Cottages com|po&s;ed of Dirt, and a barren, bleak Country, we
were very agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed, on our Approach <PB N="241" REF="259">
toward <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to find our&s;elves in an open Country, well
cultivated, and in a noble View, that &s;truck us with double Plea&s;ure, from
our being u&s;ed &s;o long to &s;ee almo&s;t nothing but what was
di&s;plea&s;ing. When you have coa&s;ted the <HI>Pentland</HI> Hills, and get
upon a Ri&s;ing, you &s;ee the City all at once, &s;pread in a Line before you,
with the Ca&s;tle to the right, the Palace and a Rock (the middle Part of which
is called ARTHUR's Seat) to the left; and a va&s;t Ba&s;on of Water (the Frith
of <HI>Forth)</HI> ap|pearing from behind it; the Country near is varied with
little Swells and Ri&s;ings, and &s;tud|ded with Villas; the Land &s;preads on
with a chearful and cultivated Look, and the whole is terminated with a long
Range of Hills, that grow dimmer and ruder, quite on to tho&s;e of the
Highlands. You may a little conceive of what an Extent this View mu&s;t be,
when I a&s;&s;ure you, that the Ba&s;on of Water about the Mid|dle of it does
not appear at all over-propor|tioned, and yet we were a&s;&s;ured, that it was
&s;ixty Miles long, about thirty in the broade&s;t Part, and fifteen in its
opening to the Sea. I could &s;ay much more of this &s;ame <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
but I have been already rather too diffu&s;ive.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="260">When you &s;ee Mr. BASKERVILLE, I beg my
Compliments to him, and all the good Family. May you long enjoy the delicious

<DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 31, 1759.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING gone for a few Days to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> I did not
receive the Favour of yours &s;o &s;oon as you might naturally imagine,
con&s;equently it was not in my Power to write to you by the returning Po&s;t;
and ever &s;ince being full of Employment, I deferred that Plea&s;ure till the
pre&s;ent Moment, which I fear will produce little worth your Attention;
how|ever, &s;uch as it is I give unto you.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="262">In going to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> I met with
lit|tle or nothing curious or entertaining, as in|deed mere Motion and
Hor&s;e-Language are Subjects that afford no great Matter for Nar|rative. As to
the Place, it is a flat, but very plea&s;ant, and has the Advantage of being
al|ways dry. The Palace has externally little to recommend it be&s;ides Bulk,
and in this Re|&s;pect, it would excite the Admiration of my Friend Dr.
A&mdash;, who would call it a <HI>noble</HI> Pile. There are many grand Rooms
within, and &s;ome fine Paintings; but the Method of &s;hewing &s;uch Places
would not allow me much Time to examine them. The Gardens are all in the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ta&s;te, with Ever-greens and &s;trait Canals, and &s;ome fine
Bra&s;s Statues inter&s;per&s;ed; there is a Terra&s;s by the Side of the
<HI>Thames</HI> a great Length, with a Wall on one Side, and Iron Palli&s;ades
on the other, which, from the Quantity of Iron and the Workman&s;hip, will
de&s;erve the Approbation of tho&s;e who deal in that Manufacture, but I think
their lea&s;t Merit is in the Place they occupy. I took &s;everal Walks round
about, and the Number of Gentlemen's Seats and neat Villages in the
Neighbourhood make it a de|&s;irable Situation. Mr. GARRICK has built at 
<PB N="245" REF="263"> <HI>Hampton</HI> a Rotund Temple, in Honour of
SHAKESPEARE, but I could not have an Oppor|tunity of &s;eeing the In&s;ide of
it. The Morn|ing I was to go to <HI>London,</HI> the Stage was full, therefore
being very dry and plea&s;ant, I walked to Town; but taking Cold that Night
after|wards at the Play, I was laid up for a Week. On my Return to
<HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> I found, be|&s;ides your Letter, a Card from Mr.
D&mdash;; I waited on him the next Morning, but had not the Plea&s;ure to find
him at Home; he has &s;ince, however, been &s;o obliging as to call on me, when
I told him your Reque&s;t, which he promi&s;ed to gratify. He was to have dined
with the Mr. K&mdash;s and me on <HI>Sunday</HI> la&s;t, but &s;ent us Word, he
had that Morning lo&s;t &s;ome Blood. Mr. K&mdash; promi&s;es to write to you
&s;oon; he gave me &s;ome of Mr. P&mdash;'s Sub&s;crip|tions, which I make no
Doubt but I &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of as &s;oon as I go abroad; for not having a
&s;ingle Article of Mourning by me, I am obliged to buy all new, and my Taylor
is a Man of &s;uch Con&s;equence, that I have not been able to obtain the
Favour of mine from his Hands yet.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="264">I have not &s;een Mr. DODSLEY &s;ome Time; I
intend him a Vi&s;it &s;oon. I have not met yet with an <HI>Antinous.</HI> Mr.
K&mdash; and I &s;hall &s;ome Morning &s;crutinize all the Shops in Town. It is
very odd, that not many Nights ago, I dreamt &s;omebody had made you a
Pre&s;ent of one; if that &s;hould happen to be the Ca&s;e hereafter, I &s;hall
have more Faith in Dreams than ever I had before.</P>
<P>All public Diver&s;ions were &s;topped for a Week on the Death of
the Prince of ORANGE; how the Town &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted without, and what
new Amu&s;ement &s;erved to kill Time, would be a Subject well worth knowing.
There has been a &s;ucce&s;sful Method thought of to tax Curio&s;ity the&s;e
la&s;t three Weeks, with the Sight a famous <HI>Mohawk</HI> Warrior, armed with
his Scalping Knife, Battle Axe, &amp;c. and painted in the <HI>Indian</HI>
Manner for War: his Body is &s;tained Mahogany, but his Face is made mo&s;t
terrific by the Hand of &s;ome Sign-Po&s;t APPELLES; in his Cheeks, the Red is
very predominant; his Eye-Brows owe their Breadth and Colour to a thick
<HI>Stratum</HI> of Lamp-black, and his No&s;e is not <PB N="247" REF="265">
le&s;s remarkable for a large Line of &s;able. He goes through his Exerci&s;e
with great Ex|pedition; performs the War Dance and Whoop, which is a Noi&s;e
unheard in this Part of the World before: all this is very fine, exceeding
curious, &amp;c. but will not you laugh when I tell you who this formidable
Hero is, <HI>Ecce ite|rum Cri&s;pinus!</HI> Mr. FOOTE, and no le&s;s a Man; if
'tis not him <HI>in propri&acirc; per&s;on&acirc;,</HI> it is one of his
Agents; 'tis certain it is no <HI>In|dian</HI>; if it was, he could not bear
Confine|ment: another Circum&s;tance, Mr. FOOTE is mi&s;&s;ing, and has not
been &s;een &s;ince the Arrival of this <HI>Mohawk,</HI> which gives &s;trong
Proof to &s;u&s;pect him; however, be who he will, he is a clever Fellow, and
has got a great deal of Money. To-morrow Night a new Farce is to be acted at
<HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> for the Benefit of Mr. S&mdash;, who has been &s;ome Time
confined in <HI>Luke</HI>'s Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Mr. G&mdash; B&mdash; is ju&s;t come from <HI>Bath,</HI> where he
left Mrs. P&mdash; in high Spirits, and Mr. and Mrs. B&mdash;; Mr. P&mdash; is
gone into <HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> to attend a Law-Suit; &s;omebody having laid
Claim to a Part of his E&s;tate, which his Fa|mily <PB N="248" REF="266"> have
had uninterrupted Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, for above fifty Years.</P>
<P>Your State of one Day's Account is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, very
natural, and too often true, par|ticularly in &s;ome Articles; in return for
it, I am promi&s;ed by &s;ome Gentlemen of my Acquaintance, a true State of
their Expences one Day, which, from the Manner of the Men and Way of Life,
cannot fail of being extraor|dinary. Some Choice Spirits, to the Number of five
and twenty, agreed to dine at WHITE's; and the Orders were, Get a Dinner as
expen|&s;ive as you can po&s;&s;ibly make it; which was punctually performed,
and, to their great Sur|prize and Mortification, found that the mo&s;t
luxuriant Dinner amounted to no more than ten Pounds a Man! This Experiment
&s;erved to convince them, that eating was a <HI>mean, pal|try</HI> Enjoyment,
and only fit for Cits and Al|dermen, to whom they left it, becau&s;e it co&s;t
&s;o <HI>little,</HI> and therefore confe&s;&s;ed the Supre|macy of Gaming,
which they embraced as their <HI>Summum Bonum,</HI> for the contrary
Rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="267">Mr. BURKE's Treati&s;e on the <HI>Sublime and
Beautiful</HI> I read almo&s;t two Years ago, in his fir&s;t Edition: the
Plea&s;ure I received from the Peru&s;al, will make me embrace the fir&s;t
Op|portunity I have of reading the &s;econd&mdash;<HI>Quaere,</HI> whether Lady
COVENTRY corre&s;ponds with his Idea of Beautiful? The Study of Phy&s;ic
cer|tainly will produce in us Admiration; becau&s;e when we trace the
Mechani&s;m of Nature phi|lo&s;ophically, as in the human Body, it becomes an
Object of the Sublime; every Step we take in &s;uch Re&s;earches, fills us with
amazing In|&s;tances of Wi&s;dom and Contrivance: but in the living Body,
Nature there conceals her Machinery, and pre&s;ents to our Eyes a &s;mooth
Object, who&s;e external Figure is moulded with &s;uch inimitable Harmony,
&s;uch an in&s;en&s;ible and plea&s;ing Variation from the right Line,
toge|ther with &s;uch a Delicacy and Tran&s;parency in the Skin, that it cannot
fail of exciting our Ideas of Beauty, which as <HI>they</HI> tend to relax the
Solids, will refine them into tho&s;e of Love. <HI>Quaere</HI> then, if that
Love may not receive additional Force in the Brea&s;t of an Anatomi&s;t, 
<PB N="250" REF="268"> from his previous Acquaintance with the in|ternal
Springs and Structure of &s;uch an Ob|ject, and thereby the better qualified to
judge of the Beauty of the whole? In other Words, may not his Admiration,
co-operating with his Love, make him a more &s;en&s;ible and feeling
Ob&s;erver? <HI>Argol,</HI> the Study of Phy&s;ic may be &s;aid (if not to
produce) to heighten Love. I &s;ubmit it to your Deci&s;ion; for who can paint
Nature, mu&s;t have <HI>felt,</HI> and who has <HI>felt</HI> is the be&s;t
Judge.</P>
<P>I did not under&s;tand you literally, that you meant what you wrote:
but as I am, beyond what many may conceive, taken up every Hour of the Day, I
intended my In&s;inuation of my Indu&s;try as a Plea for any &s;eeming Neglect
I might be guilty of towards my Friends, in not writing to them &s;o punctually
as I could wi&s;h; for I have known it a Maxim with many, that no People had
&s;o much lei&s;ure Time as tho&s;e who lived in <HI>London.</HI> But let it
not di&s;courage the Oracle; let him deal out with as liberal a Hand as he
plea&s;es, my&s;te|rious Truths, and they &s;hall be applied to form

<SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received the Tobacco-Stopper, which my Friend Mr. PERCY bought at
MOODY's Shop, and al&s;o the Letter, to authenticate its being made of the Tree
he mentioned. I am al&s;o pretty well a&s;&s;ured of the Truth thereof, having
lately &s;een Mr. HOBBS of <HI>Birmingham.</HI> who informs me, that he has a
Piece of the &s;ame Tree, which he brought from <HI>Stratford,</HI> in his
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. I think the Wood much too &s;pungy to carve neatly on it,
el&s;e &s;hould <PB N="252" REF="270"> like to improve a Hint that Mr. HOBBS
gave me, of having a Cup or little Bowl, with &s;ome particular Scene out of
one of SHAKE|SPEARE's favourite Plays carved thereon; how|ever, if you will get
him to procure (but not at an extravagant Rate) any, or what he can of the
&s;aid Mulberry-Tree, I will have &s;omething made of it, as &s;hall make it
advantageous to him for undertaking the &s;ame, if he plea&s;es. I have Coins
of mo&s;t Sorts, both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and fo|reign, and &s;ome of JAMES the
Fir&s;t, therefore do not want what &s;eems to me to be imper|fect: however, if
that he mentions was really dug up near the Tree in SHAKESPEARE's Gar|den, I
&s;hall be glad to give a &s;mall Matter more than the Weight for it, and Mr.
HOD|GETTS, will pay for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I will not apologize for applying to you on this whim&s;ical
Occa&s;ion, as I have no other Connections about your Part of the World, by
which I could procure &s;uch a Me|morial of our di&s;tingui&s;hed Bard. When I
am &s;o happy as to be the Subject of your Pen next, be &s;o good as to give me
your Thoughts on this Kind of <HI>Curio&s;ity,</HI> (or what&s;oever el&s;e 
<PB N="253" REF="271"> you plea&s;e to call it) which induces us to pay a
<HI>Price</HI> for a Mor&s;el of a Tree, planted (as Report &s;ays) by
SHAKESPEARE's own Hand; and how far you think &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion allow|able,

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>March</HI> 31, 1759.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. DODSLEY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM afraid you think me negligent: know then that I &s;at down
la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> to write you a long Letter, about &s;even o'Clock
at Night, when I di&s;covered that the Po&s;t went out at that very Hour I
&s;at down to write. I had immediate Recour&s;e to &s;uch Con|&s;olation 
<PB N="254" REF="272"> as the Ca&s;e admitted; and &s;uppo&s;ed a Letter
received on <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, might do near as well as one on
<HI>Saturday</HI> Night, con&s;idering that <HI>Sunday</HI> intervened, which
mu&s;t be a lei&s;ure Day, <HI>even</HI> for <HI>Printers.</HI> But in good
Earne&s;t now, do you <HI>think</HI> me lazy? Or have not you, under your
pre&s;ent <HI>Di&s;&s;ipa|tion,</HI> an <HI>heavier</HI> Complaint again&s;t my
<HI>Dili|gence?</HI> You and I &s;hall hardly agree about the <HI>Means</HI> of
<HI>e&s;timating</HI> Letters; you, con&s;cious of your own Genius, are
de&s;irous to value them by their <HI>Weight</HI>; while I, con&s;cious of my
late <HI>Indu&s;try,</HI> would fix their Value by the Number of
<HI>Words.</HI> What Preten&s;ions, pray, can you &s;ugge&s;t, for &s;o very
<HI>perver&s;e</HI> a Man|ner of Reckoning? Is not <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> a
<HI>moral Virtue?</HI> And are not many written Words a <HI>Proof</HI> of
Indu&s;try? But though your <HI>Ingenuity</HI> be even a Miracle, you will
hardly prove it to be a <HI>moral Virtue,</HI> unle&s;s, indeed, in the <HI>Way
you manage it</HI>; and <HI>&s;o, all</HI> your Faculties are moral Virtues:
however, we le&s;s <HI>artful,</HI> or le&s;s <HI>heroick</HI> Per&s;onages,
mu&s;t magnify the Virtues that we <HI>have</HI>; of the&s;e, Indu&s;try is
one, though perhaps <HI>this</HI> had been &s;carce <HI>allowed</HI> me, till
within the&s;e three or four <PB N="255" REF="273"> Months pa&s;t. I &s;ay,
that we, who are the <HI>Animae nil magnae Laudis egentes</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">

we, the <HI>Animae viles, inhumata infletaque turba:</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Low Souls&mdash;an unburied, and unlamented Multitude.</NOTE> In

<Q REND="inline">"<HI>nati Fruges con&s;umere;</HI>"</Q> if
<HI>we</HI> would appear con&s;iderable, pray what Method can we take? I know,
in|deed, but two; the one of di&s;paraging <HI>your</HI> Abilities, which is
not quite &s;o fea&s;ible; the other, of taking all occa&s;ion to magnify our
own good Qualities. If then, Indu&s;try be a Virtue, I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
it very remarkably: Not a Moment of my Time pa&s;&s;es, but I am employed,
either in over&s;eeing Labourers; reading ROBINSON's <HI>Hi&s;tory of
Scotland</HI>; writing in my Paper Books, ('tis not material <HI>what,</HI> but
writing;) perplexing the <HI>Birmingham</HI> Ar|ti&s;ts with Sketches for
Improvements in their Manufactures, which they <HI>will</HI> not under&s;tand;
and la&s;tly, and finally, feeding my Poultry, my Ducks, my Pigeons, and my
Swans; which la&s;t give me as much Plea&s;ure, as what I had be|fore gave me
Vexation. No incon&s;iderable Pane|gyrick, <PB N="256" REF="274"> I'll
a&s;&s;ure you! And &s;urely this is not only <HI>Indu&s;try,</HI> but an
<HI>Indu&s;try</HI> of a <HI>better Kind</HI> than what employs the <HI>Animae
viles</HI> of a Drawing-room. And now this <HI>la&s;t In&s;tance</HI> of my
great Indu&s;try puts me in Mind of a&s;king you a Que&s;tion:</P>
<P>Pray now, you that are a Mythologi&s;t, what an ab&s;urd Man you
are, not to jump at an Invitation to come directly to the <HI>Lea&s;owes?</HI>
Here am I, (like your Friend AESOP, before OGILBY's <HI>Fables</HI>; or like
ADAM, in our old <HI>Bibles</HI>) &s;itting once or twice a Day with eve|ry
created Animal before me. Is not this the only Re&s;idence for a Per&s;on that
is writing Fables? 'Tis true, this very Per&s;on may con|template better in a
<HI>Crowd,</HI> than <HI>another</HI> in the Depth of Solitude: <HI>you</HI>
may far &s;urpa&s;s <HI>me,</HI> who thus <HI>conver&s;e</HI> with
<HI>Birds,</HI> while he de&s;cribes a Sparrow from <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI> or a
King-fi&s;her from <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s:</HI> but <HI>Imagination</HI> is a
pro|digious <HI>Heightener</HI>; and unle&s;s he paints them from Life, may he
not <HI>attribute</HI> to a <HI>King-fi&s;her</HI> much finer Feathers than he
in Truth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es? Pray take the Opinion of Mr. SPENCE&mdash;How I
blu&s;h, while I recollect that Name! <PB N="257" REF="275"> And yet, were it
not for my <HI>own</HI> Omi&s;&s;ions, it mu&s;t revive <HI>only</HI> my mo&s;t
<HI>favourite</HI> Ideas. Surely 'tis written in the Book of Fate, that I
&s;hall di&s;charge my Debt within a Po&s;t or two; for Fate evidently enough
interferes, or I could never have been &s;o long &s;ilent. I am almo&s;t
a&s;hamed to de&s;ire my humble Re&s;pects to him, and yet it is impo&s;&s;ible
for me to &s;up|pre&s;s my Feelings.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now proceed to Bu&s;ine&s;s. Pa&s;t &s;ix o'Clock once
more; but the Po&s;t now goes out at ten. If you <HI>can</HI> procure me the
quarto Cuts for MILTON, it will be a very de&s;irable Fa|vour.</P>
<P>Mr. BOND has made &s;ome Alteration in your <HI>Grove,</HI> which I
thought very pretty on its <HI>Arrival</HI>; yet, perhaps, he may be right
enough, if Mr. GRIGNION can comprehend his Meaning. The Trees he means <HI>on
the wrong Side the Water,</HI> are &s;ome of tho&s;e oppo&s;ite to the Letter
<HI>S,</HI> which I have put upon the Back: but I am fearful of
<HI>&s;poiling</HI>; and mu&s;t beg Mr. GRIGNION would re-compare the Print
with Mr. BOND's original Drawing, then retouch his <PB N="258" REF="276">
Plate, and let me have a few more Proof-Sheets of both the Prints. Give me one
or two Lines by <HI>Return</HI> of Po&s;t, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>No Books ready? I want MALLET's Works, bound in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>
Leather, and lettered on Green. Pray excu&s;e this la&s;t vile Page. I have
wa&s;ted my Time, and now am utterly at a Fault for it.</P>

<DATE><HI>June</HI> 6, 1759.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is, perhaps, no uncommon Ca&s;e for the Magnitude of a Debt to
prevent, or at lea&s;t retard every Step toward a Di&s;charge. In Truth, the
many Favours you have con|ferred upon me by the Packet I have received 
<PB N="259" REF="277"> for <HI>E&mdash;,</HI> have made me a&s;hamed of &s;uch
a partial Payment, as my Health and Lei|&s;ure would permit; when I complain of
Health, I mean no other than a Kind of Drow&s;ihead and Lentor which has
&s;omewhat infe&s;ted me at this Sea&s;on; perhaps it were better expre&s;&s;ed
by that di&s;reputable Name, Stupidity: be that, however, as it may, it is by
this chiefly, I have been di&s;qualified from tho&s;e refined Sorts of
Amu&s;ement, in which your Letters and Pac|kets required me to engage.</P>
<P>I have been expected to pa&s;s a Week at <HI>Shiffnal,</HI> ever
&s;ince the Beginning of <HI>May,</HI> where I was by particular Appointment to
meet our Friend Mr. BINNEL. The Vi&s;it is not laid a&s;ide, but will probably
take Place in about a Fortnight's Time or le&s;s. One Pleaure I expect from it,
be&s;ide what I &s;hall reap from Mr. PITT and Mr. SLANEY's Com|pany, and that
turns upon the Opportunity it will afford me of peru&s;ing your OVID in
Conjunction with Mr. BINNEL; and it has been with this View, in &s;ome
Mea&s;ure, that I have deferred the Examination you de&s;ired me to be&s;tow
upon it. In general, I would <PB N="260" REF="278"> wi&s;h you to make it as
ju&s;t to the Author's Sen&s;e, and to your own Sentiments, as you can, and
afterwards con&s;ider me as a mere Mu&s;ic Ma&s;ter, whom you would employ to
tune your Harp&s;ichord; in other Words, as a proper Per&s;on to retrench any
little Encroachments upon Simplicity, Ea&s;e of Style, or Harmony.</P>
<P>I want to communicate many Things; but mu&s;t defer mo&s;t of them
till I &s;ee you. And pray let Mrs. PERCY know me for one of your peculiar
Friends, and then I hope &s;he will not &s;cruple to reward me with an
irregular Vi&s;it, by Way of Di&s;tinction. I brought my Friend JAGO's new
Bride to pay me that Compli|ment the other Day.</P>
<P>Mr. DODSLEY in his la&s;t Letter de&s;ired, I would pre&s;ent you
with his new Edition of <HI>Cleone,</HI> which is the only one you &s;hould
pre|&s;erve. It is, according to my be&s;t Calculation, improved in about an
hundred Places merely, and altered in about &s;ix. I will either keep it till
you come, or &s;end it to you, if you will &s;hew me <HI>how.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="279">I had retouched and tran&s;cribed both the
<HI>Gentle Herd&s;man</HI> and <HI>Edom of Gordon,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two Pieces in Dr. PERCY's <HI>Collection of Antient
Poetry.</HI></NOTE> long be|fore your Letter arrived. Your &s;upplemental
Stanzas mu&s;t undoubtedly approach nearer to what was the original Reading,
than tho&s;e which I have &s;ub&s;tituted, and which I will not &s;end you now,
becau&s;e I will multiply your In|ducements to vi&s;it my Place in the proper
Sea|&s;on.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t by all Means read Dr. YOUNGE's <HI>New Conjectures on
original Compo&s;ition</HI>; and let it deter you, when you have compleated
OVID, from engaging in any more Tran&s;lations. I have al&s;o read the
E&s;&s;ay on the pre&s;ent State of Learning, written by a Dr. GOLDSMITH, whom
you know, and whom &s;uch as read it will de&s;ire to know. LA MOTTE al&s;o has
afforded me no little Entertainment: I read it on Account of DODSLEY, who you
may remember is writing Fables, and who has re|que&s;ted me to &s;end him my
Thoughts upon the Subject.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Fini&s;hed my Peregrinations the Day before you began yours; for
the Day after my Arrival at this Place, I called at your Lod|gings, and was
informed you &s;et off that very Morning for Mr. SHENSTONE's. I have of|ten
thought you, in many Re&s;pects, a Man to be envied; but in your pre&s;ent
Situation, you are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Happine&s;s too great for
Mortals; enjoying in one of the hotte&s;t Sea&s;ons that ever was known in
<HI>England,</HI> the Shade and Coolne&s;s of the fine&s;t Groves per|haps in
the World, rendered &s;till more en|chanting by the Conver&s;ation of one of
the be&s;t Poets, as well as one of the worthie&s;t Men of the Age. A certain
Monarch of old <PB N="263" REF="281"> broke off all Connexion and Alliance with
a Brother King in <HI>Greece,</HI> for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e the
other experienced an uncommon Share of Felicity. If his Example de&s;erved to
be followed, you are the Man of all others, who&s;e Friend&s;hip I would
renounce. But the Truth is, you cannot have more Happine&s;s than I wi&s;h you;
nor more, I am per&s;uaded, than you de&s;erve; and therefore, I will e'en be
contented to hold on my Amity with you, till I have a better Rea&s;on for
parting with it, which I am very &s;ure I &s;hall never be fur|ni&s;hed
with.</P>
<P>With Re&s;pect to my own Travels, I have little to &s;ay worth
relating. Finding my Health not equal to &s;o long a Journey as to
<HI>Scarborough,</HI> and the Weather at the &s;ame Time proving extremely cold
and wet, I turned out of the high Road at <HI>Newark,</HI> and cro&s;&s;ed the
Coun|try to <HI>Nottingham.</HI> As I found the Air of the Place agree with me,
and likewi&s;e met with an old Friend, who lives like a true <HI>Arcadian,</HI>
in a little rural Cottage, at a &s;hort Di&s;tance from the Town, I continued
there till my Re|turn hither. I &s;aw every Thing in the Neigh|bourhood 
<PB N="264" REF="282"> worth looking at; but what plea&s;ed me mo&s;t was Lord
BYRON's Abbey upon the Fore&s;t, which without Doubt you have vi&s;ited. Adieu,
dear Sir.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 12, 1759.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT Apology can I make for not writing to you now for more than a
Month, after receiving &s;o much Plea&s;ure and &s;o many Civilities? However,
as you too well know how ea&s;y it is for &s;uch Things to hap|pen, I will make
none, but leave you to <HI>for|give us our Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as we forgive them
that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us.</HI> And this would lead me to expo&s;tulate
with you for not coming <PB N="265" REF="283"> to <HI>Bath:</HI> but I forbear,
having many Things to be pardoned in my&s;elf, as well as many to deliver to
you, and therefore &s;o much for Apo|logy.</P>
<P>I have &s;een <HI>Persfield,</HI> Mr. MORRIS's Seat; and Mr. SPENCE
was ju&s;t come from &s;eeing it, when he arrived at <HI>Bath:</HI> he is much
&s;truck with it, and has attempted &s;omewhat towards a De&s;cription of it. I
&s;hall have a Copy of his Papers &s;oon, and will tran&s;mit it to you. The
Place is certainly of the great and &s;ub|lime Kind; mo&s;t of the near Views
are &s;een below you from the Top of high Precipices, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;teep
Rocks, hanging Woods, the Rivers <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Wye,</HI> which la&s;t
winds about the Feet of the Rocks below you, in a very romantic Manner,
almo&s;t &s;urrounding a very pretty Farm, where Cattle and Sheep are feed|ing
in the Meadows, at &s;uch a Depth below your Eye, that they &s;eem very much
dimini&s;hed. The Rocks are bold and numerous, half co|vered with Woods, and
ri&s;e almo&s;t perpendi|cular from the Edge of the Water to a &s;ur|pri&s;ing
Height, forming, from the great Cliff, a Kind of double Amphitheatre. A Gun
fired <PB N="266" REF="284"> from the Top of this Cliff, creates, by the
Reverberation of the Report among&s;t other Rocks, a loud Clap of Thunder, two
or three Times repeated, before it dies away: but even this Echo, conformably
to the Pride and Gran|deur of the Re&s;t of the Place, will not deign to
an&s;wer a &s;maller Voice than that of a Mu&s;|ket; with a Culverin, I
&s;uppo&s;e, it would hold a noble Dialogue. The Town of <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI>
and its ruined Ca&s;tle, appear in the near View at &s;omewhat more than the
Di&s;tance of <HI>Hales Owen</HI> from your Grove; and the romantic Windings of
the <HI>Wye</HI> are &s;een all the Way to them, except now and then that its
Stream is hid among the Rocks; and all the Way below them, till it is
&s;wallowed up by the <HI>Se|vern,</HI> at about two miles Di&s;tance, where
that River is al&s;o near two Miles over, and from whence it extends, enlarging
in Breadth, quite down to <HI>King-Road,</HI> below <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> I can
con|ceive nothing finer than the&s;e Views would be, were the Waters of the
Rivers as clear as that of the <HI>Thames:</HI> but, alas! they are &s;o muddy,
that they will &s;carce return the Images of the Rocks, Trees, and other
Objects, that ri&s;e upon their Banks. The di&s;tant Views are very
ex|ten&s;ive, <PB N="267" REF="285"> and lets the Eye into Parts of four|teen
different Counties. The Extent of the Walks is near four Miles, which in about
five Hours Time I made &s;hift to accompli&s;h. I went from <HI>Bath</HI> with
a polite Party of Gen|tlemen and Ladies, and our three Days Ex|cur&s;ion was
altogether exceedingly agreeable.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am this In&s;tant

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Suppo&s;e you have &s;ome Time ago received from my Brother the
Things you ordered. I de&s;ired him to &s;end them, as al&s;o the Poems for Mr.
WOODHOUSE, to whom I beg my Com|pliments, and am &s;orry he had them not
&s;ooner, but I had really forgot them. I have been &s;uch a Rambler &s;ince I
came to Town, that I have not had Time to attend to any Thing. I have not
written a &s;ingle Fable &s;ince that I &s;ent you, and yet am &s;o
unrea&s;onable, as to wonder you have not &s;ent me your half Dozen. I am
writing an E&s;&s;ay on Fable, and thinking of a Preface, both of which I
&s;hall de&s;ire you to take the Trouble of reading and correct|ing, as &s;oon
as I have done them; however, I believe I &s;hall take your Advice, and not
think of printing this Winter. I was glad to hear you had &s;ome Hopes of
fini&s;hing your <PB N="272" REF="290"> Affairs with Mr. D&mdash;, and hope
they are com|pleated to your Satisfaction. I have been fa|voured with a Letter
from Mr. WREN, which I an&s;wer by this Po&s;t. You &s;aid, my Lord LYTTELTON
was to be at the Admiral's till af|ter Chri&s;tmas, but I &s;aw him pa&s;s by
in his Chariot a few Days ago. You have given me Hopes of &s;eeing a Survey of
your Farm; I beg you will not delay what will give me &s;o much Plea&s;ure:
would to God you would bring it your&s;elf, with all your verbal
De&s;criptions, Mottoes, &amp;c. and let them be engraved and printed. I wi&s;h
I could hear that you was writ|ing &s;omewhat. What think you of an Elegy on
the Death of General WOLFE? You know, I &s;uppo&s;e that he was to have been
married to a Si&s;ter of &mdash;, before he went on his la&s;t Expedition, but
that &s;he de&s;ired it might be deferred till his Return. I think the Scene
might be laid in her Chamber, on the re|joicing Night for the taking of
<HI>Quebec</HI>; her Friends may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have concealed his Death
from her, and her Anxiety for his Welfare, in the Mid&s;t of the Rejoicings,
might have a fine Effect: when &s;uddenly his Gho&s;t &s;hould appear, inform
her of his Fate, and <PB N="273" REF="291"> endeavour to comfort her in her
Affliction. Here is Room for De&s;cription, Reflection, and the true Pathetic.
Such a Story as this in your Hands could not fail to be fine: I wi&s;h you to
try, and that right &s;oon.</P>
<P>I have &s;earched all the Shops in <HI>London</HI> for a
<HI>Pan</HI> proper for the Subject we talked of, but in vain. What think you
of the enclo&s;ed Sketch? I think it might be mended. Is not the left Hand
rai&s;ed too high?</P>
<P>I had written thus far on <HI>Saturday</HI> After|noon, when your
Letters and Plans arrived by the Penny-Po&s;t, which determined me to &s;tay
till <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> before I fini&s;hed my Letter. You have now
embarra&s;&s;ed me; I have &s;o many Things to reply to, that I know not where
to begin: I mu&s;t take them as they lie.</P>
<P>Did I ever tell you of Mr. P&mdash;'s <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Novel? If I
did, I have quite forgot it, and will therefore never own it. I &s;hall be very
glad to &s;ee Mr. H&mdash;'s Picture: my Compli|ments to him, and tell him, I
&s;u&s;pect he in|tends it as a reconciling Pre&s;ent to Mi&s;s S&mdash;. 
<PB N="274" REF="292"> I wi&s;h Mr. ALCOCK would fini&s;h my two Draw|ings for
the Fables; as to my Face, it is a Subject not worth con&s;idering; however, I
will make you an impudent Propo&s;al: if you will exchange Faces with me when
you come up to Town, we will both &s;it to the &s;ame Painter.
Notwith&s;tanding you have taken Pains to for|feit all Claim to Favour from Mr.
SPENCE, I am very well &s;atisfied, the Letter you pro|mi&s;e will effectually
cancel all your Offences: I &s;hall go down to him in about a Month, (you &s;ee
I give you Time enough) enclo&s;e it to me, and I will carry it to him, with
one of your &s;mall Plans, to which I will put Re|ferences; at the &s;ame Time,
I will endeavour to get the <HI>Scotch</HI> Paper on Gardening. As to my Sketch
of the <HI>Lea&s;owes,</HI> I have not yet had Time to think of it; but as
&s;oon as I have fini&s;hed my E&s;&s;ay, e&s;pecially if you make it
unnece&s;&s;ary for me to write any more Fables, by &s;ending me your half
Dozen, I will certainly &s;it down to it; you &s;ee I am willing to make good
Bargains. The Duche&s;s of SOMERSET's Letters I have &s;afe, and will &s;end
them to you. I am glad Mr. GRAVES is going on; and doubt not but the Work 
<PB N="275" REF="293"> will turn to his Advantage. I &s;hall certainly not
print the Fables this Winter; and as to the E&s;&s;ay, I hope to have gone
through it in about a Fortnight. I have read Dr. HAWK|SWORTH's
<HI>Adventurer</HI> on the Subject, in which I exactly agree with you; and I
have read a bad Tran&s;lation of LA MOTTE's E&s;&s;ay: I know nothing el&s;e on
the Subject worth rea|ding. When I &s;end you my E&s;&s;ay, I beg you will give
it any Improvement which you may think it wants, either in correcting
Im|perfections, or in &s;upplying Deficiencies. I have got &s;ix more new
Fables from Dr. L&mdash;.</P>
<P>Do not think that I will tamely hear my Friend's <HI>Cu&s;tard</HI>
abu&s;ed; I &s;hall certainly find a Time to vindicate his Honour, and to make
your proud Foreigner own the &s;uperior Merit of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Cu&s;tard.</P>
<P>And now for your Plans: I am much obliged to you for &s;ending them;
and if I might have my Wi&s;h, I would engrave the &s;mall coloured one, with
Figures of Reference. This &s;hould be the Fronti&s;piece to a Pamphlet, which
&s;hould contain a De&s;cription of the Places and Things referred to,
&s;omewhat more at large <PB N="276" REF="294"> than they are in this Drawing;
together with all your Mottos, Ver&s;es, Compliments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as
al&s;o a verbal De&s;cription of the ri&s;ing and fall|ing of the Ground; the
Objects, Pro&s;pects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all the Way round. In the Middle of the
Title-Page, I would put the la&s;t Plate of VIRGIL's <HI>Grove</HI>; as a
Head-piece at the Beginning of the Pamphlet, I would have a Print of your
Hou&s;e; and at the End, which &s;hould be contrived to be almo&s;t a whole
Page, I think the chief Ca&s;cade might be placed. The Plate &s;hould be worked
off in Green; the Road through the Path round the Hou&s;e, and the Water,
&s;hould be afterwards coloured by Hand. Think of the&s;e Things; and may
Heaven give you Re&s;olution to put them in practice!</P>

<P>HEALTH, Happine&s;s, and all the Com|pliments of the Sea&s;on, to
dear Mr. SHENSTONE! I have enquired of all the SPILS|BURY's in Town, but I
cannot find that my little Drawings are yet &s;ent up. This, if Mr. ALCOCK be
&s;till with you, I wi&s;h you would be &s;o good as to tell him, with my
Com|pliments. When am I to expect an An&s;wer to my la&s;t long Letter? And
when am I to have your half dozen Fables? I have &s;ent my

carefully and cri|tically over: they are both very &s;hort; and there are blank
Pages on one Side, for what|ever Alterations or Remarks you &s;hall favour me

di&s;po|&s;ing them in the Order they are to &s;tand.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM with you aware, that the Story of the <HI>Spani&s;h Lady</HI>
is rather too &s;imple, too de|&s;titute of Matter for the Generality of People
who frequent the Galleries of a <HI>London</HI> Thea|tre; but might not &s;ome
Incidents of Humour be extracted from the Group of Sailors, which mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily be introduced in the Piece? There are in real Life various, and
very &s;tri|king Characters among our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tars. In|deed, 
<PB N="280" REF="298"> much U&s;e has been made of them al|ready, and to very
plea&s;ing Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, I propo&s;e (or rather merely <HI>allow</HI>) this
Violation of the Simplicity of the Story, as a Means to make it an&s;wer the
Purpo&s;es of Emolument to you, if you choo&s;e to under|take it; for, as far
as relates to my own Ta&s;te, I think, even in Repre&s;entation, it could not
be pre&s;erved too &s;imple.</P>
<P>The Con&s;ideration that an Author is com|pelled to forego, in many
In&s;tances, his fa|vourite Intention, renounce a Compliance with his own
Judgment, and even &s;ometimes abo|li&s;h the very Excellencies of his Genius,
to gratify the vitiated Ta&s;te of a few noi&s;y Au|ditors, who otherwi&s;e
would condemn the Work, is rather melancholy; and could not by any Species of
Rea&s;on be &s;upported, except that which you advanced, namely, that your
Thea|tres in <HI>London</HI> are maintained in the&s;e Days at a very great
Expence, and that Expence mu&s;t be repaid; con&s;equently, if SHAKESPEARE
cannnot elicit a full Hou&s;e, HARLEQUIN mu&s;t extort it; but woe the while
for the State of <PB N="281" REF="299"> Letters and Genius!&mdash;Such was not
the ge|nuine End and Intention of a Theatre. I, for my own Part, look upon it
as a Temple rai&s;ed to <HI>Moral Virtue</HI>; the De&s;ign of it is to
in&s;truct through the Medium of Delight; to &s;hew Virtue and Vice in their
re&s;pective Co|lours: and the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Audience is, to judge,
compare, define, to di&s;tingui&s;h between what is given for Example, and what
for Pre|caution: &s;o conducted and pre&s;erved, a Thea|tre truly merits the
Denomination I have given it; but if <HI>Moral</HI> is to &s;ubmit to
<HI>Matter,</HI> if <HI>fine Sentiment</HI> is to give Way to <HI>fine
Scenery,</HI> it falls from the Purpo&s;es for which is was originally
in&s;tituted, and becomes a Place of <HI>Shew</HI> indeed, but not of

<P>All the&s;e Ab&s;urdities and Misfortunes are owing to the Audience;
and it is much to be lamented, that the Conductor of an u&s;eful Place of
Amu&s;ement cannot oppo&s;e and rectify them; but I clearly &s;ee he cannot.
Your Anecdote of Mr. GARRICK's laudable Attempt, &s;ome Years ago, to remove
from public View an annual Object of Indecorum and Immorality, and
&s;ub&s;titute a Piece, which (however antique) <PB N="282" REF="300">
furni&s;hed Matter for the moral HOGARTH to di&s;play his Genius on, diverts me
much, and would (were I of any Country be&s;ide <HI>England)</HI> mo&s;t
probably a&s;toni&s;h me. As an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> it does not. The Attempt
was as much to the Credit of Mr. GARRICK, as the Defeat of it was
di&s;reputable to the Audience.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It had been a Cu&s;tom
at both the royal Theatres, for many Years, to perform the <HI>London
Cuckolds</HI> on the Lord-Mayor's Day; Mr. GARRICK, from Motives of Pro|priety,
endeavoured to &s;ub&s;titute the old Play of <HI>Ea&s;t|ward-Hoe</HI>; but the
Audience exploded it.</NOTE></P>
<P>This Subject might, I think, by it&s;elf fur|ni&s;h Matter for a
tolerably-&s;ized E&s;&s;ay; and I marvel that &s;ome Writer, who has rather
more Affection for the U&s;e of a Pen than my&s;elf, does not adopt it. A
Reflection on the very &s;evere Trial a dramatic Writer undergoes, when he
offers his Work to the Public, has frequent|ly called forth my Compa&s;&s;ion;
the Means to procure general Approbation are &s;o vague and precarious, that I
almo&s;t wonder when I hear of any one hardy enough to &s;tand a Can|didate for
it.</P>
<P>My Zeal in the&s;e Particulars has made me deviate from the
principal Object of this Let|ter, <PB N="283" REF="301"> which was to reque&s;t
you to make a lit|tle Sketch of my favourite Story upon drama|tic Principles,
during the Cour&s;e of this Win|ter; and let us <HI>(Deo favente)</HI> when

may be an agreeable Amu&s;ement, if it an&s;wers no other Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Whether I may ever execute the Elegy which Mr. DODSLEY has
recommended, is very uncertain, though I much approve his Plan. Suppo&s;e you
were to attempt it&mdash;I have &s;ome Rea&s;ons for thinking that Elegy would

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Bath,</HI> 
<DATE><HI>July</HI> 21, 1760.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SCARCE was I &s;at down after our agree|able Jaunt, when I was
welcomed by my dear Mr. SHENSTONE's polite Favour. You are particularly good in
conferring &s;o much Honour on a poor, prattling, in&s;ignificant Being like
me; yet, however ill I may confe&s;s I de|&s;erve it in my Ability to repay it,
I will ven|ture to affirm, that my Merits, if rated by the Value I &s;et on it,
are equal to tho&s;e of any other wild Female in the Circle of your
Acquaintance. But is it come to this? And mu&s;t I really take Pen in Hand, and
de&s;cribe our little Peregrinations? I mu&s;t, for you have commanded me. If I
even wanted an Induce|ment beyond your Command, it is at Hand. I mean our
common Friend, Mr. HULL. I applied to him for Coun&s;el, and he flatly &s;ays,
I &s;hall be <HI>rude,</HI> if I decline to obey. Here then, my 
<PB N="286" REF="304"> good Sir, take it in the be&s;t Manner I am able to
execute a de&s;criptive Letter, and if it is badly done, you mu&s;t be my
Advocate to your&s;elf, for having drawn me into &s;uch a Dilemma; in &s;hort,
your own humane Heart mu&s;t make Allowances for whatever is un|worthy your
Judgment.</P>
<P>Be it known unto you then, that la&s;t <HI>Wed|ne&s;day</HI>
Morning, we all four (you know our Party) got into a Coach, at &s;ix o'Clock,
and drove at no &s;low Rate, for we got to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> at eight. There
we were met by a Gentleman and a Lady from the Hot-well, as wild and as
whim&s;ical as our&s;elves; we are all of a Spinning I can tell you. We ju&s;t
took a Bit of Breakfa&s;t at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and then made the be&s;t of
our Way to <HI>Au&s;t,</HI> the old Pa&s;&s;age over to <HI>Wales</HI>; there
we dined, and then, after dri|ving a long Way over the Rocks, among&s;t
Sea-Weed, and I can't tell what, with &s;ome Difficulty we got into a
<HI>Stable,</HI> in which we were to cro&s;s the Water&mdash;A Stable! methinks
I hear you &s;ay&mdash;Why yes, in Truth, good Sir; for pray what can one
better compare a Thing to, that was littered from one End to the 
<PB N="287" REF="305"> other with dirty Straw, and filled with as many Hor&s;es
as People? Oh, we went mo&s;t &s;ocia|bly over, Hor&s;es, Coach, and
our&s;elves, all to|gether: this, however, was the wor&s;t of the Bargain, all
the be&s;t was to come.</P>
<P>When we arrived in <HI>Wales,</HI> we ju&s;t took a little
Refre&s;hment, and then drove to <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> remarkable for the great
Height of its Bridge, the Tide ri&s;ing higher by &s;ome Degrees there than in
any Part of the three Kingdoms. At this Place we were to &s;leep, &s;o we went
to the be&s;t Inn to get Accommodations. The&s;e &s;ecured, we made the be&s;t
of our Way to <HI>Persfield,</HI> the Seat of Mr. MORRIS; and &s;uch a Place,
for the Variety and Beauty of its Pro&s;pects, I never &s;aw.</P>
<P>The Gardens are &s;even Miles round, &s;o our poor old Lady was
forced to occupy a Seat ju&s;t by the Hou&s;e, and the re&s;t of us then walked
as far as our Legs were able to carry us. We could not compa&s;s the whole
round, but &s;aw all the principal Pro&s;pects. To at|tempt de&s;cribing them
is impo&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t to do it with Ju&s;tice to their Merit, yet,
though <PB N="288" REF="306"> unequal to the Ta&s;k, I mu&s;t &s;ay
&s;omething. The Gardens are &s;ituated on the <HI>Rocks,</HI> I can|not call
them the <HI>Banks,</HI> of the River <HI>Wye,</HI> and cut into Walks, in
them&s;elves exce&s;&s;ively beautiful, but the &s;uperior Beauty of the Views
they command, &s;o entirely engro&s;&s;es the Eye, that they can be very little
heeded. Some|times we look down upon the River, from an Eminence of near four
hundred Feet, which winds it&s;elf round as in a Semi-circle. The oppo&s;ite
Side is bounded by Rocks of equal Height, &s;ome barren, and re&s;embling the
Ruins of old Fortifications; others covered with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Variety
of Greens the Eye can wi&s;h to behold, while at the Bottom, Cattle are feeding
in the &s;weet Pa&s;tures by the Ri|ver's Side: Cattle, we were told the
Creatures were which we &s;aw; but really our Faith had need be &s;trong to
believe it, &s;ince they appeared to our View more like Hens and Chickens, and
I do a&s;&s;ure you, one of our Company took them for &s;uch.</P>
<P>Here too we &s;aw a Place called the <HI>Lover's-Leap,</HI> it was
at the Summit of a Rock full four hundred Feet high from the River, and 
<PB N="289" REF="307"> I believe, if u&s;ed, would be a certain Cure for Love
or any other Kind of Trouble. Af|ter having delighted our Eyes as long as our
Feet would &s;upport us, we went back to the reverend Lady; and one of our
Company being acquainted with a Lady at Mr. MORRIS's Hou&s;e, we were invited
to eat a Bit of Cake and drink a Gla&s;s of Wine; this was a mo&s;t agreeable
Repa&s;t after our Fatigue, and helped us on very notably. But here, methinks,
I hear you &s;ay, Alas, the poor old Lady! She &s;aw none of the&s;e fine
Sights!&mdash;Yes, but &s;he did, Sir, as you &s;hall hear: We had a Servant of
Mr. MORRIS's to attend our Coach, and he con|ducted us through various Fields
to &s;ome Views we had not &s;een in the Part of the Gardens we walked over,
and from the&s;e the reverend Dame fea&s;ted her Eyes; &s;o you &s;ee &s;he
came in for a Share of the Show.</P>
<P>We now returned to <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> where, after &s;pending as
laughable an Evening as could be de&s;ired, (I have before told you, we were
all of a Spinning) we retired to re&s;t, a Thing not at all unplea&s;ing after
the Employment of the Day.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="308">Next Morning we got into a large Boat, with
two Pair of Oars, and went up the Ri|ver <HI>Wye,</HI> to a Place called
<HI>Tintern-Abbey.</HI> Here we had the extreme Plea&s;ure of contemplating the
mo&s;t curious Piece of Ruins I ever beheld; I do not believe your
<HI>Balbecks</HI> or <HI>Palmiras</HI> can much exceed it. It is the Remains of
a Cathedral; all the out&s;ide Walls remain &s;o far entire, as to be a Fence
to keep People out, but are in a cracked, ruinous State; mo&s;t of the Pil|lars
on the In&s;ide are &s;tanding, though robbed of the fine Carving which adorned
them; yet we had &s;ome Notion of their former Beauty, from many Pieces
tolerably intire, which lay &s;cattered here and there on the Ground. Gra&s;s
and Wood Strawberries here &s;upply the Place of a Pavement, except in one
&s;mall Part, where it has not yet been broken. Here is di&s;cerni|ble a very
pretty Kind of Tile OF Stone, the Ground yellow, flowered with black.</P>
<P>The Top of the Church is entirely off, &s;o that Birds build all
around in the Pillars and Walls. There are planted a great Va|riety of Trees in
many Parts of the Edifice, <PB N="291" REF="309"> &s;ome Fruit-Trees: I
my&s;elf eat three Straw|berries I gathered in the Body of the Church. This
Place, it &s;eems, was dedicated to the Virgin MARY, and Part of an Image
remains, which &s;till bears &s;ome Re&s;emblance to her. There is likewi&s;e
one of an Earl of PEM|BROKE, formerly Lord of the Place; that Earl who was
&s;irnamed <HI>Strong-Bow,</HI> and as Tradition &s;ays, who had five Fingers
and two Thumbs on each Hand; one Hand of the monumental Figure is &s;o perfect,
that we could di&s;tingui&s;h the five Fingers and two Thumbs. In &s;hort, I
never in my Life &s;aw any Place &s;o well worth vi&s;iting of its Kind as this
<HI>Tintern-Abbey,</HI> and we were as loath to quit it, as I &s;eem now to be
of fini&s;hing my wild De&s;cription.</P>
<P>Next we went to look at &s;ome Iron Works, and &s;aw the Manner of
making Bar Iron, and Drawing of Wire. After this we got again into our Boat, to
return to <HI>Chep&s;tow,</HI> and as we rowed along the River, had the
Plea&s;ure of looking up to tho&s;e beautiful Rocks we had looked down from, in
Mr. MORRIS's Ground. This Rever&s;e of View made a &s;econd Enjoyment, and we
were more &s;en&s;ible of the <PB N="292" REF="310"> Height of the Mountains in
this Situation, than when we were at the Summit of them. So delightful was this
Water-Scene, that we all wi&s;h|ed a Continuance of it. This put us upon
a&s;k|ing the Ma&s;ter of the Boat, if he could &s;afely ven|ture to land us in
<HI>England</HI>; he a&s;&s;ured us he could, and then it was re&s;olved,
<HI>nem. con.</HI> only to &s;top at <HI>Chep&s;tow</HI> to dine&mdash;we did
&s;o, and &s;ending our Carriage and Hor&s;es to the Pa&s;&s;age, to be again
taken over in the before-mentioned Stable, we went on board our Boat, and rowed
till we got into the <HI>Severn,</HI> and then the Wind favouring us, we had a
mo&s;t charming &s;ail to the oppo&s;ite Shore. Here we had another Piece of
Variety; the River was not deep enough from the Rocks to bring the Boat to dry
Ground, nor &s;hallow enough to let the Car|riages come to us, &s;o we were all
compelled to be carried out on Men's Shoulders.</P>
<P>We drank Tea at the old Pa&s;&s;age-Hou&s;e, and then drove to the
Hot-well, <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> but made <HI>King's-We&s;ton-Down</HI> in our
Way, which, for the Beauty of its Pro&s;pects, could well vie with what we had
been &s;eeing in <HI>Wales.</HI> Next Morning our fir&s;t Route was up to
<HI>Clifton,</HI> <PB N="293" REF="311"> where we &s;aw Mr. GOLDNEY's Grotto;
of its Kind, to be &s;ure, the mo&s;t fini&s;hed Thing; all De&s;cription
mu&s;t fail to do it Ju&s;tice, &s;o let your Imagination form the mo&s;t
regular, elegant, co&s;tly Arrangement of Shells it is able, and it can't go
beyond the real Beauty.</P>
<P>From a Part of Mr. GOLDNEY's Garden, we had a Pro&s;pect I think
rather &s;uperior to what we &s;aw in <HI>Wales</HI>; it was, if I mi&s;take
not, more exten&s;ive, commanding a full Scope of the <HI>Severn</HI> lo&s;ing
it&s;elf in the Sea, an en|tire, and uninterrupted View of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI>
and as fine a rural Pro&s;pect around, as the Eye could wi&s;h to behold.</P>
<P>Are you not, my good Sir, almo&s;t weary with reading? I am of
writing, I can a&s;&s;ure you; and I fear you'll not make out what I have wrote
without &s;ome Difficulty. But my Ideas of this charming Scene flowed &s;o
fa&s;t, I could not keep my Pen in any Order, it run on, and I mu&s;t beg you
to take it as it is, for I have not Time to write a fair Copy.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="312">Mr. HULL, I take it for granted, will have the
Happine&s;s to deliver this Scrawl of mine, as he &s;ets out for
<HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI> to-morrow Morning. He has been endeavouring to
per|&s;uade us to another Jaunt incontinently, and to let him guide us to the
&s;weete&s;t Retirement in the World, &s;uch he calls the <HI>Lea&s;owes.</HI>
That Happine&s;s is denied us at pre&s;ent, but I tru&s;t will not be always
&s;o.</P>
<P>I hope, my good Sir, this implicit Obe|dience to your Commands, will
entitle me to &s;ome &s;mall Degree of Approbation, and that you will continue

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PRAY never think Excu&s;e can be nece&s;&s;ary to me about
Exactne&s;s in an&s;wering my Letters; I am always glad to hear from you when
it is agreeable to you to write, but am not one of tho&s;e over-kind Friends
who are for ever out of Humour with tho&s;e whom they rather enthrall than
oblige, by giving them that Name. As a Proof I never wi&s;h to act &s;o by my
Friends, or am afraid of being treated &s;o by them, I will own to you, I am
not quite &s;ure, I &s;hould have an&s;wered your la&s;t Let|ter &s;o &s;oon,
were it not that I am under &s;e|rious Concern to find how aukwardly I mu&s;t
have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to Mr. SHENSTONE, if I gave him Room to believe, I
harboured a &s;ecret Wi&s;h to have &s;o fine a Poem as his Ode 
<PB N="296" REF="314"> &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. On the contrary, I &s;hould think
my&s;elf guilty of a very great Crime and In|ju&s;tice to the Public, if I were
to be the Means of depriving them of &s;o charming and rational an
Entertainment. I gave him the true Rea|&s;ons in my Letter, for de&s;iring that
my own Name, nor that of my humble yet peace|ful Dwelling, might be in&s;erted.
You know I always envied the Lot of 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>La Vi&s;lette, qui &s;e cache &s;ous

<P>'Tis true, my dear Lady LUXBOROUGH, Times are changed with us,
&s;ince no Walk was long enough, or Exerci&s;e painful enough to hurt us, as we
childi&s;hly imagined; yet after a Ball or Ma&s;querade, have we not come Home
very well contented to pull off our Ornaments and fine Cloaths, in order to go
to re&s;t? Such methinks is the Reception we naturally give to the Warnings of
our bodily Decays; they &s;eem to undre&s;s us by Degrees, to prepare us for a
Re&s;t that will refre&s;h us far more power|fully than any Night's Sleep could
do. We &s;hall then find no Wearine&s;s from the Fatigues which either our
Bodies or our Minds have under|gone; but all Tears &s;hall be wiped from our 
<PB N="297" REF="315"> Eyes, and Sorrow, and Crying, and Pains, &s;hall be no
more; we &s;hall then without Wearine&s;s move in our new Vehicles, tran&s;port
our&s;elves from one Part of the Skies to another, with much more Ea&s;e and
Velocity, than we could have done in the Prime of our Strength, upon the
fleete&s;t Hor&s;es, the Di&s;tance of a Mile. This chearful Pro&s;pect enables
us to &s;ee our Strength fail, and await the Tokens of our approaching
Di&s;&s;olution with a Kind of awful Plea&s;ure. I will ingenuou&s;ly own to
you, dear Madam, that I experience more true Happine&s;s in the retired Manner
of Life that I have embraced, than I ever knew from all the Splen|dour or
Flatteries of the World. There was always a Void: they could not &s;atisfy a
rational Mind: and at the mo&s;t heedle&s;s Time of my Youth, I well remember,
that I always looked forward, with a Kind of Joy, to a de|cent Retreat, when
the Evening of Life &s;hould make it practicable.</P>
<P><HI>Boadicea</HI> I have read&mdash;there is an intere&s;ting Scene
or two in it; but there is &s;omething wanting in the Management of the Drama
to keep up the Spirits of the Audience. <HI>Philo|clea</HI> 
<PB N="298" REF="316"> I have not &s;een, nor have heard &s;uch a Cha|racter of
it, as to rai&s;e my Curio&s;ity. If you have not read <HI>Deformity,</HI> an
E&s;&s;ay, by Mr. HAY, nor his <HI>Religio Philo&s;ophi</HI> (I don't know how
that la&s;t Word &s;hould end) I believe they will entertain you very well in
their different Ways. The <HI>Adventurer</HI> will &s;oon be publi&s;hed in
Volumes, and will be very well worth buy|ing. I doubt I mu&s;t agree with Mr.
SHEN|STONE, that the Stile of <HI>Sir Charles Grandi&s;on</HI> is too prolix,
and yet I don't know any of it I &s;hould be willing to part with, except
<HI>Harriot Byron</HI>'s Conver&s;ation with the <HI>Oxonian,</HI> in the
fir&s;t Volume, and the Preparations and Entertainments at Sir
<HI>Charles</HI>'s Wedding, in the fifth.</P>
<P>When I came home from taking the Air on <HI>Friday,</HI> I was very
agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to find Lady NORTHUMBERLAND ready to receive me, as I
had no Notion of her coming. She had been alarmed with a fal&s;e Report, that I
had not been &s;o well for &s;ome days as &s;he left me. I took the Opportunity
of &s;hewing her your Letter, and &s;he de&s;ired me to make her Com|pliments
to your Lady&s;hip, and tell you, &s;he <PB N="299" REF="317"> keeps no Servant
about Lady ELIZABETH, while &s;he is at School, and at her Return will think it
nece&s;&s;ary to have a Per&s;on of a middle Age about her. Such a one &s;he
now has about her little Boy; a pretty Sort of Woman, who &s;peaks
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> equally well, is grave and properly
behaved, and, I believe, hopes for Lady ELIZABETH's Place, when her little
An|gel of a Ma&s;ter goes into the Hands of the Men. His Mamma took him away
with her on <HI>Saturday,</HI> after lending him to me for a Month (though
&s;he is exce&s;&s;ively fond of him) becau&s;e &s;he &s;ees he is the Joy of

Uncle; but his Open|ne&s;s and Mildne&s;s of Temper are the very &s;ame. Her
elde&s;t Boy too, is a very &s;en&s;ible and good one. He and Lady GREVILLE
dine with me from <HI>Eaton</HI> every <HI>Sunday</HI>; they are here at
pre&s;ent for two or three Days, on Account of their being Hollidays. I have

<SALUTE>Dear Mr. SHENSTONE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very glad, that with the Return of Spring, your Strength and
Spirits begin al&s;o to revive. May they proceed and encrea&s;e with the

that Fruit of &s;o exqui&s;ite a Fla|vour &s;hould be lo&s;t to the Ta&s;te of

be to &s;end it up without Delay: but this, how|ever, I leave intirely to your

<P>I have applied to Mr. RICH, in Behalf of Mr. HERON; but he has no
Vacancy in his Hou&s;e, nor Room to employ him: as to Mr. GARRICK, I am not on

are very acceptable to me, as they a&s;&s;ure me of your Friend&s;hip;

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 11, 1761.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>Dear Mr. DODSLEY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;poken to Mr. L&mdash; upon the Sub|ject of his Dedication;
and he agrees with me, that there can be no properer Per&s;on to procure the
Leave we want than Mr. D&mdash;. Suppre&s;s, therefore, if you plea&s;e, my
Letter to Mr. L&mdash;, and engage Mr. D&mdash; as &s;oon as ever you can, to
do his be&s;t Offices in this Affair. They wait only for the Plates, and my
Lord's An&s;wer, before they can order his Arms to be engraved. I blundered, in
regard to L&mdash;'s Univer&s;ity; a Blunder &s;o much the more unlucky, as
they have no Ma&s;ters of Arts at <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> he was of
<HI>Aberdeen.</HI> As to the re&s;t, you will give Mr. D&mdash; any pro|per
Information my Letter affords you. L&mdash; does not expect a Pre&s;ent; he
will be perfectly &s;atisfied if the Work entitle him to any Degree of Lord
B&mdash;'s e&s;teem: and this Mr. D&mdash; may <PB N="304" REF="322">
<HI>&s;ay,</HI> &s;hould his Lord&s;hip give him an Oppor|tunity. Perhaps it
need not be mentioned, that L&mdash; is a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> unle&s;s my Lord
&s;hould make particular Enquiry. Betwixt Friends, I believe, that having no
E&s;tabli&s;hment, he means here|after to a&s;k &s;ome little Matter, by Means
of a <HI>Scotch</HI> Lady, who is my Lord's Relation.</P>
<P>The &s;maller Drawing you enclo&s;ed is really a perfect Beauty, and
mu&s;t be executed at all Events when I return it, which I mean to do on
<HI>Saturday</HI>; I &s;hall give the Engraver one or two Directions.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could think as highly of the Fron|ti&s;piece. In Truth,
it does not plea&s;e me; and what to do, I cannot tell. The De&s;igner does not
&s;eem to enter into the Spirit of the Story; and the Circum&s;tance of the
Shield hung upon the Pillar, (a &s;ingle Pillar of the Temple had been
&s;ufficient) with the Motto being wholly omitted, throws the whole Stre&s;s
upon the Me|rit of the two Figures in the fore Ground. I am &s;orry to &s;ay,
the&s;e do not an&s;wer, MAE|CENAS appears with no Dignity, and HORACE's
Attitude I can't explain. If the Floor had <PB N="305" REF="323"> been rai&s;ed
one Step where the Patron &s;its, and his Per&s;on tall, or his Chair
embelli&s;hed a little, &amp;c. and if HORACE were &s;horter, (as his Nature
was) his Attitude no Way vio|lent, and his Head down-ca&s;t, it would,
per|haps, have removed &s;ome of my Objections. But if there were no
Po&s;&s;ibility of hanging a Shield, &amp;c. on a Piece of a Temple, and &s;o
making the Back-Ground important, (as the De&s;igner &s;urely might have done)
yet there evidently were Means of rendering it more beautiful than it appears
here. HAYMAN cer|tainly &s;hould have been the Man! But more of this when I
write on <HI>Saturday.</HI></P>
<P>When &s;hall I &s;ee <HI>Bapti&s;ta Porta?</HI> As al&s;o the
Fronti&s;piece only to the Ornaments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Temples and Churches?
The Ver&s;es in the <HI>London Magazine</HI> are tolerably well printed, though
my Punctuation is not ob&s;erved. Your Brother was to &s;end me al&s;o the

W&mdash; has or will de&s;ire your Bro|they to &s;upply him with the few

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR very obliging Letter gave me great Plea&s;ure; pardon my Delay
in not re|turning my Thanks for that Favour &s;ooner; I waited to have offered
my &s;mall Collection to your View at the &s;ame Time, which Dr. W&mdash;
gen|teely excu&s;ed him&s;elf from the Trouble of pe|ru&s;ing, profe&s;&s;ing
he had not Lei&s;ure or critical Skill enough to be of Service to the
Work.&mdash;<PB N="307" REF="325"> When my Brother received my Papers at
<HI>Bir|mingham,</HI> he &s;hewed them to Dr. H&mdash;, who obligingly a&s;ked
Leave to &s;hew them to Lord LYTTELTON, which you will imagine was too
agreeable an Offer not to be accepted: the Doctor took them to <HI>Hagley,</HI>
about a Fort|night &s;ince, to be tran&s;mitted to his Lord&s;hip by Admiral
SMITH. As &s;oon as I receive them, I &s;hall immediately do my&s;elf the
Plea|&s;ure of &s;ending them to the <HI>Lea&s;owes.</HI></P>
<P>To Mr. &mdash; I find my&s;elf indebted for the Publication of my
Ver&s;es to Mi&s;s L&mdash;, of which, and my Letter to her, &s;he had given
him Copies. I received the fir&s;t Intimation of that Affair from you, but
&s;oon after &s;aw the &s;ame incorrect Copy, together with his ab|&s;urd and
di&s;advantageous Account of me, in two different Magazines. I wrote to him
up|on that Subject; he promi&s;ed to retract what he had a&s;&s;erted upon
Mi&s;information; but his Letters and Behaviour did not appear quite equal to
the amiable Idea I had conceived of him. I am informed by a Friend in Town,
that the &s;ame Per&s;on has &s;ent up a hand&s;ome Apo|logy, to be in&s;erted
in the <HI>Gentleman's Maga|zine,</HI> <PB N="308" REF="326"> for
<HI>February,</HI> which (as if it were intended purely for the Satisfaction of
the Public, and not to do Ju&s;tice to an injured Per&s;on) he did not
conde&s;cend to honour me with the Peru|&s;al of.</P>
<P>I am extremely obliged to you for the Trou|ble you took in &s;ending
a correct Copy of tho&s;e Ver&s;es to the <HI>London Magazine,</HI> which I
&s;aw with much Satisfaction. I am al&s;o to acknowledge the Favour of your
friendly Advice, in Regard to Mr. W&mdash;'s Papers; what you &s;ay on that
Head gives me great Plea&s;ure, as it intirely coincides with my own
Sentiments: I had no Thoughts of in&s;erting tho&s;e Papers in my Collection,
but looked up|on them as Things of a private Nature, in|tended only for the
Amu&s;ement of our&s;elves.</P>
<P>When la&s;t I &s;aw that Gentleman, he men|tioned my adding tho&s;e
to the Number I in|tended to print; had I directly objected to it, I had &s;ome
Rea&s;on to think it would di&s;gu&s;t him: he mentioned referring it to you,
which I agreed to with Plea&s;ure, re&s;olving to give it a fair Chance, not
doubting but your Judgment <PB N="309" REF="327"> and Delicacy would
di&s;approve of &s;uch an Ad|dition to my little Volume: (that is to be.) I
have not yet wrote to Mr. W&mdash;, but &s;hall take an early Opportunity of
letting him know your Opinion, which cannot (I think) be any Diminution of the
Plea&s;ure he may take in his Compo&s;ition, as it is only the Subject which
denies it a Place in my Collection.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not in my Power to expre&s;s the grate|ful Sen&s;e of the
Obligations I owe you, for your mo&s;t agreeable Letter, and for tho&s;e
valuable Pieces which accompanied it, and your other Favours. I am
&s;en&s;ible, that &s;o late a Return to &s;uch repeated Marks of Goodne&s;s,
carries with it Appearances again&s;t me; but as I am convinced, your
Good-nature cannot in|terpret any Thing har&s;hly, I hold it as almo&s;t
unnece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ure you, that Neglect was not the Cau&s;e of my
Silence; that, indeed, would have been a Fault for which I could not have
forgiven my&s;elf, far le&s;s could I have a&s;ked Forgivene&s;s of you; the
Hurry of Bu|&s;ine&s;s, during the Winter Se&s;&s;ions, is the only Excu&s;e I
&s;hall plead in my Defence, which but too effectually deprived me of the
Plea&s;ure of corre&s;ponding with my Friends, and cut me off from all
Communication with Elegance or the fine Arts&mdash;and of late, an Inflammation
in my <PB N="311" REF="329"> Eyes has much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me, which at
pre&s;ent gives the more Pain, as it prevents me from the Satisfaction of
writing &s;o fully as I in|tended, and from giving you any Remarks on tho&s;e
Pearls you was &s;o good as to &s;end me; the chief Intention of this is to
a&s;&s;ure you, that I have not been unmindful of your Friend Mr. PERCY,
who&s;e De&s;ign I much approve of, and the more e&s;pecially, as he has given
you a rejecting Power. Plea&s;e to let him know that I have written to my
Friends every where, to pick up all the Ballads they can, while I am
&s;earching every Part in Town, where I &s;u&s;|pect any Thing may be found
worthy of Pub|lication. In a &s;hort Time I hope to have it in my Power to
tran&s;mit you &s;ome Pieces which will merit a Place in his Collection.</P>
<P>Although it is not without &s;ome Difficulty that I now write, yet I
cannot leave off with|out letting you know, how much I was de|lighted with your
excellent Ver&s;es, intended for the Pede&s;tal of <HI>Venus de

that I can give them (or your <PB N="312" REF="330"> other Compo&s;itions) fall
infinitely &s;hort of their real Value. The Thoughts are fine, and ri&s;e
naturally from the Subject; the three fir&s;t Stanzas &s;hew, indeed, the Hand
of a Ma&s;ter, nor do I remember any Thing of Antiquity &s;uperior to them for
Elegance and Simplicity of Ver&s;ification, Ju&s;tne&s;s of Sentiment, or
Beau|ty of Allu&s;ion; nothing can be more happily imagined, than the
Oppo&s;ition of your ba&s;h|ful Beauty to the <HI>Paphian</HI> and
<HI>Phrygian</HI> God|de&s;s, while the Choice of Words does Ho|nour to the
Truth and Beauty of the Senti|ment. The &s;eventh is charming, and the Epi|thet
<HI>Meretricious</HI> conveys &s;o &s;triking a De&s;crip|tion of fal&s;e
Ta&s;te, and is &s;o well adapted to the ful&s;ome carving and gilding of
<HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Baubles, that he mu&s;t be dull indeed who is not &s;truck
by it. It irks me, that I am obliged to defer taking Notice of the other Pieces
till another Time.</P>
<P>I had lately the Plea&s;ure of a Vi&s;it from your Friend Mr.
COOKES, who&s;e Connection with you I wi&s;h I had known &s;ooner. I &s;hall
take the fir&s;t Opportunity of &s;ending you the Anandale Bronze Earth he
mentioned. In the <PB N="313" REF="331"> mean Time, I have &s;ent you a little
Provi|&s;ion of the be&s;t <HI>Pre&s;ton-Pans</HI> Snuff, both toa&s;ted and

<P>AFTER I parted from you at <HI>Broom&s;grove,</HI> I arrived very
&s;afe and &s;peedily at <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI> as I hope you did at the

in which he has lingered for &s;ome Years pa&s;t; but by keeping up his Spirits
and his Appetite, by great Temperance, and by taking an Airing regularly twice
a Day in his Chai&s;e, for &s;ix or eight Miles at a Time, he has &s;o nicely
trimmed his feeble Lamp of Life, that he has prevented it from going out, and
may po&s;&s;ibly pre&s;erve it burning &s;ome few Years longer. I employed Mrs.
D&mdash; to get me a Pot of Lampreys, which I &s;ent, Carriage paid, to be left

good.</P>

again, therefore, in two or three Days for <HI>London,</HI> where, without the

&s;ince I have had the plea&s;ing Ho|nour of being known to Mr. SHENSTONE. To
comprehend in a Nut-Shell a Volume of Ideas, is the happy Talent of a
&s;uperior Genius, which tho&s;e of the more minute, at a Di&s;tance, admire,
but cannot attain; at lea&s;t, in our dull Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, the Difficulties
attending &s;uch an At|tempt are almo&s;t in&s;uperable. It can't have
e&s;caped &s;o penetrating an Ob&s;ervation as Mr. SHENSTONE's, that bad Men
examine every Law with no other Intention than to reap the Benefits, and at the
&s;ame Time to evade the equal Contributions intended to be levied from all
tho&s;e, who, as they enjoy the Benefits, ought in Rea&s;on to contribute their
ju&s;t Pro|portions of the Expences incurred by tho&s;e, <PB N="318" REF="336">
to whom they are indebted for tho&s;e Advan|tages. Again&s;t &s;uch artful and

to be upon our Guard, and to protect, by all the Vigilance we are able, the
hone&s;t and well-meaning from the Artifices and De&s;igns of the di&s;hone&s;t
and ungenerous. Few Words, alas! however &s;ignificcant, are not able to effect
&s;uch a Security; and though Dullne&s;s has been the unfortunate Cau&s;e of
in|troducing a Multiplicity of u&s;ele&s;s Tautology in many legal
Tran&s;actions, yet the nece&s;&s;ary Cau|tions, requi&s;ite to protect the
unde&s;igning from the Dangers of Fraud, from tho&s;e who are the Pe&s;ts of
Society, have unhappily made &s;ome Repetitions nece&s;&s;ary in many Ca&s;es,
where a liberal Interpretation, and Elegance of Expre&s;|&s;ion would point
them out as unnece&s;&s;ary, and place them in a ridiculous, and, indeed,
con|temptible Light, in the Judgment of a liberal and generous Ob&s;erver,
unacquainted with the hackneyed Ways of bad and de&s;igning Men. But, alas!
Such Men there are&mdash;&s;uch mu&s;t be guarded again&s;t; and to aid me in

Cautions I am obliged to ob&s;erve, in order to guard again&s;t the
Inconveniences I have before hinted at, will permit me, &s;hall profit by them;

&s;hall take the Liberty you &s;o obligingly per|mit me, of de&s;iring the
A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Honour of your Advice, where I have Occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>If I was much &s;u&s;ceptible of Vanity, I &s;hould have ample Food

from &mdash; could give you any Plea&s;ure or Entertainment: but I am not yet
&s;o vain&mdash;Plain Facts, and plain Truth and Since|rity, are all that I can

may, by &s;ome happy Event that may de&s;erve your Attention there, be
