<P>LONG &s;ince Surgeons both in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> have a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the treatment of Venereal Di&s;ea&s;es, and Phy&s;icians generally decline it. I cannot conceive what makes it your exclu&s;ive province the treating of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, &s;ince in mo&s;t ca&s;es the whole frame of the body is affected, and in very few the hand of an operator is wanted. But as the cu&s;tom prevails, I do not pre|tend to &s;trive again&s;t the torrent, and content my&s;elf with offering to you the mo&s;t effectual method of curing Gleets&mdash;a method which I at fir&s;t di&s;cover|ed, by reflecting on the deplorable &s;ituation of a bo&s;om friend, and which I after|wards put in practice at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of &s;everal acquaintances, and have ever &s;ince followed with con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>A man of mercenary principles would, no doubt, keep it a &s;ecret; but a liberal mind is above &s;uch intere&s;ted procedures. To promote the good of &s;ociety is the duty of all its members; be&s;ides, what an exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure it is for a benevolent heart to le&s;&s;en, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the number of tho&s;e unfortunate victims, who, without hope of relief, labour under the many evils to which human nature is &s;ubject. Thus, not &s;atisfied with relieving the patients who apply to me, I wi&s;h I could relieve many more by your hands. Happy, if in this re&s;pect, the fruit of my labour is not lo&s;t!</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON GLEETS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I ENTER in the &s;ubject without any preamble. A gleet, by the want of &s;kill in tho&s;e who undertake to cure venereal di&s;|ea&s;es, is but too often the &s;ad con&s;equence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this e&s;&s;ay &s;hould meet with approbation, I &s;hall offer to the public a new method of radically curing gonorrhoeas in a &s;hort time.</NOTE> of a virulent gonorrhoea.</P>
<P>The running is ever more or le&s;s coloured, often of a green tint, more often of a pale yellow, and &s;ometimes of a dark brown, a little blood being mixed with it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">The matter di&s;charged comes from the ulcerated glands of the internal tunic of the urethra: but when the running &s;uddenly in|crea&s;es, it always proceeds, or from an inflammation of the mu&s;cular tunic, as happens after or freely enjoying the bottle and the company of women, or from a rarefaction of the fluids<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A proof of it is, that in this ca&s;e the running is ever accompanied with a &s;en&s;ation of &s;calding, which is not felt in the other ca&s;e.</NOTE>, cau&s;ed by the expan&s;ion of the internal air; as happens in &s;pring and autumn, two &s;ea&s;ons where the atmo&s;phere, being le&s;s ela&s;tic, does not oppo&s;e &s;o great a re&s;i&s;tance to the action of the internal air.</P>
<P>Formerly the running was attributed to a relaxation of the affected parts, an opinion &s;till in credit among the ignorant; but by introducing a probe in the urethra, every one may be convinced that it is wholly cau&s;ed by ulcers. <HI>Daran,</HI> who fir&s;t made this di&s;covery, attempted to cure gleets by &s;uppurative bougies. His method was &s;oon adopted as the mo&s;t rational, and ever &s;ince followed by the be&s;t practitioners. Undoubtedly it proved &s;uc|ce&s;sful in many ca&s;es; but in many others proved abortive, even in the hands of <HI>Daran</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Long I had not &s;een bougies employed for curing gleets, without finding them often ineffectual: however, as it was not my pro|vince to treat venereal di&s;ea&s;es, this method had not engaged my attention. Mere chance afterwards obliged me to turn my thoughts to the &s;ubject, as I &s;hall now relate with the reader's per|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Calling one morning on an intimate friend of mine at <HI>Paris,</HI> I found him involved in the deepe&s;t melancholy. On enquiring into
<PB N="7" REF="6">the cau&s;e, he acquainted me, that having been &s;o long in the hands of <HI>Daran</HI> for the cure of a gleet, he at la&s;t thought him&s;elf free of it, when, on a &s;udden, he was cruelly di&s;appointed. Upon which he begged of me to give him any advice in my power, his &s;ituation being extremely critical on the point of marriage with a young lady of fortune whom he loved, and with whom he could not bear the thought of engaging, while under &s;o cruel a circum|&s;tance. On this I &s;aid to him all that occurred to me ju&s;t then for his con&s;olation.</P>
<P>After I had le&s;t him I could not help reflecting on his melan|choly condition, and thinking how po&s;&s;ibly he could be extricated out of it. The be&s;t way that offered to my mind was his cure.</P>
<P>I indeed con&s;idered &s;uppuration as the only method to effect it. But not accu&s;tomed indi&s;criminately to adopt a method as &s;oon as it is extolled, much le&s;s to follow it blindly, I enquired into the rea|&s;ons of the frequent inefficacy of the u&s;ual practice, and &s;oon was made &s;en&s;ible of them.</P>
<P>After mature con&s;ideration, I called upon my friend, and pro|po&s;ed to attempt his cure. He readily agreed. The &s;ame day he took an apartment next to mine. I immediately began his treat|ment, attended him clo&s;ely, and by &s;uppuration properly conducted, was radically cured in &s;even weeks.</P>
<P>Some months after, two of his acquaintances left incurable by <HI>Daran,</HI> applied to me, reque&s;ting my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and both were cured in eleven weeks time. But here is not the place for enume|rating cures performed by my method; I therefore proceed to point out the defects of the actual practice of preparing and u&s;ing bougies to cure gleets, and &s;hall communicate the proper way to improve it, &s;o as never to fail the intention.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">The actual method of treating gleets is frequently un&s;ucce&s;sful, becau&s;e defective.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t defect is the hardine&s;s of the &s;uppurative, common bou|gies are made with. This is obvious from the &s;tructure of the af|fected parts. The internal tunic of the urethra, although ever irritated in a virulent gonorrhoea, is &s;eldom the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e. Its &s;eat is commonly the glandular tunic beneath the mu&s;cular, as is &s;hewn by the abundance of the &s;uppuration, and more plainly by di&s;&s;ecting. In &s;uch ca&s;e, it is evident, that a common bougie introduced in the urethra, acting immediately on the internal tunic alone, cannot cau&s;e but an imperfect &s;uppuration of the ulcerated parts, and con&s;equently cannot perfect the cure.</P>
<P>If &s;o, when the ulcers of the glandular tunic lie at the entrance of the lacunes in the internal tunic; how much more when the corroding virus has extended its &s;eat, and produced a kind of &s;inu&s;&s;es, as is always the ca&s;e in inveterate gleets!</P>
<P>Another defect in common bougies is a want of degradation in their &s;uppurative virtue.</P>
<P>It is well known, that practitioners employ but one kind of &s;up|purating bougies, made with a plai&s;ter, who&s;e ba&s;is is lytargirium of lead and oil of olives; whil&s;t, in order to conduct &s;uppura|tion properly, bougies &s;hould be more or le&s;s &s;uppurative, according to the &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Having for a long while made u&s;e of &s;uppurative bougies, practi|tioners u&s;e de&s;&s;icative ones, even when &s;uppuration is &s;till abundant. But to tho&s;e who have the lea&s;t notion of the means employed by nature in the reproduction of fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance, it is evident, that &s;uch a &s;udden pa&s;&s;age from active &s;uppurative remedies to de&s;&s;icative
<PB N="9" REF="8">ones, never can produce the de&s;ired effect. After a forced &s;uppu|ration, kept &s;o for a long while, far from being incarnated, the cavity of the ulcers is widened, and all the fibres around it have lo&s;t their natural ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;&s;icative bougies employed immediately afterwards, being all of an a&s;tringent quality, and acting on the part alone they are in contact with, can only dry and cri&s;p the edges of the ulcers, and cau&s;e them to become callous. The running is therefore &s;topt for a time, and never fails to break out again, when circulation is con|&s;iderably increa&s;ed by any accidental cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of common bougies, as they are actually made, is not only defective, but unrational and hurtful.</P>
<P>In common bougies, the &s;uppurative plai&s;ter is &s;pread over their whole &s;uperficies. Now, to apply the remedy in every point of the urethra, in order to cure &s;ome ulcerated parts, is certainly very ab|&s;urd. What is commonly alledged in &s;upport of &s;uch a practice is, that it is only by giving to the medicament this exten&s;ion, that it can be &s;ure of reaching and acting on the di&s;ea&s;ed parts; but the &s;eat of the di&s;temper can ea&s;ily be found, by gently introducing a probe into the urethra, and there only may the remedy be applied.</P>
<P>Ab&s;urd did I &s;ay this method was; it would be well if it was no wor&s;e, notwith&s;tanding it is but too common for practitioners to a&s;&s;ert each, that bougies of his own making are not irritating; it is a fact, that as being &s;uch only they can act, for without inflamma|tion no &s;uppuration is to be expected. It is plain therefore, that the long &s;tanding application of an irritating remedy over the whole membrane of the urethra, mu&s;t be attended with fatal con&s;e|quences, &s;uch as cri&s;pation, and afterwards relaxation of its fibres. How many patients have I not heard, complaining of hav|ing
<PB N="10" REF="9">nearly lo&s;t their virility by the u&s;e of tho&s;e bougies continued for &s;ome months. In &s;everal of them, I have even &s;een the fibres of this membrane &s;o corrugated, as that the prae-eminence of the glands was retracted within, and this retraction was ever accompa|nied with excruciating pains at the time of erections; however, the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences attending the actual practice of curing gleets, is a permanent difficulty of making water. Di&s;&s;icating bou|gies being employed in order to con&s;olidate the ulcers, never fail to dry to an exce&s;s the parts they are in contact with; they there|fore produce too hard a cicatrice. This makes a more or le&s;s &s;trong &s;tricture in the urethra, which always reduce the &s;tream of the urine.</P>
<P>Pointing out the defects of the actual way of conducting &s;up|puration, in order to cure gleets, is in &s;ome &s;ort indicating the proper way to do it; but as there are many particulars to be ob|&s;erved in the effectual method of curing tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, I &s;hall lay down its whole proce&s;s.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t care is to in&s;pect the parts. I take a bougie made of white wax, rendered flexible with a little turpentine. I make round and &s;mooth one of its extremities, which I dip in the mu|cilage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I u&s;e the mucilage of mar&s;hmallows in&s;tead of oil, for it does not oppo&s;e the heal|ing of ulcers as oily &s;ub&s;tances do.</NOTE> of mar&s;hmallows, and then I introduce it gently into the urethra up to the urine bladder, carefully ob&s;erving the parts where the patient feels any acute pain, which parts I con|&s;ider as the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e. Being thus made &s;ure where the ulcers are &s;ituated, I take another &s;imilar bougie, upon it I mark places corre&s;ponding to the ulcers, there &s;pread all round a little of a &s;uppurative plai&s;ter, which I make &s;mooth, rolling it between the fingers, anointed it with mucilage of mar&s;h|mallows, and I introduce the bougie in the urethra, when I judge that the remedy is in contact with the ulcers, I bend back the ex|ternal
<PB N="11" REF="10">extremity of the bougie; and to fa&s;ten it, nothing is want|ing but to pinch it a little.</P>
<P>The &s;uppurative I u&s;e at fir&s;t is diachilum cum gummis, rendered &s;ofter than u&s;ual; in order that being further di&s;&s;olved by the na|tural heat, it may penetrate into the cavity of the ulcers.</P>
<P>The &s;pace of time I continue u&s;ing it, is proportionate to the inveteracy of the di&s;ea&s;e; and to fix it between proper limits, re|quires the &s;kill of an able practitioner.</P>
<P>The cau&s;tic humours which an ulcer contains, vitiate the nu|tritive lymph, and prevent its a&s;&s;imilation to the &s;ub&s;tance of the corroded fibres; and be&s;ides adhering to the&s;e fibres, they keep them in a &s;tate of rigidity, and oppo&s;e their exten&s;ion. The fir&s;t rea&s;on therefore, &s;howing the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uppuration in order to cure ulcers, is to evacuate the&s;e humours. The next is to di&s;&s;olve the callous edges of the ulcers, and to aid the corroded fibres to di&s;charge the vi&s;cid fluids with which they are filled.</P>
<P>Thus having u&s;ed diachilum cum gummis, I employ four times a day injections made with a weak &s;olution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Although the &s;olution of &s;al ammoniac be a powerful di&s;&s;olvent of callous &s;ub&s;tances, yet it does not injure &s;ound parts.</NOTE> of &s;al ammoniac in common water, and order the injection to be kept in the urethra five minutes every time. Mean while I make u&s;e of a weaker &s;uppurative, &s;uch as<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This unguentum is but little, if at all, known in England. The formula of its compo&s;ition is to be found in the <HI>Paris</HI> di&s;pen&s;atory.</NOTE><HI>l'onguent de la Mer.</HI></P>
<P>The time the injection and &s;uppurative are to be continued, is likewi&s;e to be proportionate to the inveteracy of the di&s;ea&s;e, and
<PB N="12" REF="11">mu&s;t be longer if any a&s;tringent injection has been made u&s;e of, or any callous had been di&s;covered in the urethra by pa&s;&s;ing the probe up to it.</P>
<P>When the u&s;e of this &s;uppurative is di&s;continued, I employ another made with
<LIST>
<ITEM>Gold lytharge &ounce; vj.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Oil of olives &ounce; xji:</ITEM>
<ITEM>Yellow wax &dram; jv.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Venet. turpentine &dram; ji.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Bol. Armoen. &dram; ji.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Every day I render it le&s;s &s;uppurative by mixing with it a few drops of Peruvian bal&s;am, and continue its u&s;e till the ulcers are con&s;olidated.</P>
<P>The &s;pace of time nece&s;&s;ary to perfect the cure of &s;light gleets, is generally from twenty-five to thirty days; and of &s;tubborn ones, &s;eldom exceeds ten weeks.</P>
<P>But to the&s;e ob&s;ervations I mu&s;t add a few others very material.</P>
<P>Sometimes patients who labour under the&s;e complaints, are of a habit of body &s;corbutic, or infected with the venereal taint; in &s;uch ca&s;es the humours ought to be purified, before the cure of the ul|cers is attempted.</P>
<P>If the patient is of a phlegmatic or plethoric habit of body, the ulcers are always difficult to heal. A drachm of bark in powder &s;hould therefore be pre&s;cribed to be taken in a gla&s;s of red wine, every day during the treatment.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">Such is my method of curing gleets; and if ten years practice attended with con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;s, may be allowed a &s;ufficient time to convince of its efficacy, I may confidently offer this my idea to the &s;en&s;ible practitioners, and flatter my&s;elf that every one who &s;hall adopt it, will find the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Among the great number of in&s;tances I could quote to evince its &s;uperiority over all other methods hitherto in vogue, I confine my|&s;elf to the two following.</P>
<P>In 1762, <HI>J. A.</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> contracted a virulent gonorrhoea at <HI>Naples.</HI> There he applied to the famous <HI>T</HI> ***. Having been &s;ome months in his hands, without receiving any benefit, he went to <HI>Rome,</HI> where affairs of importance called for his pre&s;ence; and there likewi&s;e he was attended for a long while by &s;ome reputed practitioner, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>From <HI>Rome</HI> he went to <HI>Florence,</HI> where he was al&s;o under the hands of the be&s;t &s;urgeons.</P>
<P>Two years were already wa&s;ted in fruitle&s;s attempts, when the patient &s;et off for <HI>Paris,</HI> and there was for two years together under the care of the celebrated <HI>Daran.</HI> During that time he underwent a long cour&s;e of remedies. The running indeed di&s;appeared, when di&s;&s;icative bougies were made u&s;e of, but returned &s;oon after.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance, however, which mu&s;t appear &s;trange at fir&s;t &s;ight is, that the return of the flux was periodical. It regularly broke out every year at the beginning of &s;pring and autumn.</P>
<P>From <HI>Paris</HI> the patient came over to <HI>London,</HI> his place of abode. Anxious to be cured, he applied to an eminent &s;urgeon, (whom it would not be candid to name) who for eighteen months attended
<PB N="14" REF="13">him with great a&s;&s;iduity. Various were the remedies employed to &s;ubdue the running. Among them the &s;uppuration was again tried, and again did the running &s;top by the u&s;e of di&s;&s;icative bougies. When &s;topt the patient was a&s;&s;ured of his being cured, and to remove every doubt about it, was advi&s;ed to drink punch pretty freely. So he did; but no &s;ooner was the tryal made, than the running returned with greater violence. Vexed at &s;o many di&s;ap|pointments, the patient was determined to re&s;ign his fate to Nature alone, and for a while did not alter his re&s;olution, till hearing (from a friend) of &s;ome &s;triking cures of &s;imilar complaints I had performed, that he might not have any reproach to make to him|&s;elf, he re&s;olved to venture a la&s;t experiment.</P>
<P>When he applied<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>October,</HI> 1769.</NOTE> to me, his running was ju&s;t coming upon him; it was of a deep green, both &s;calding and abundant. The erection of the penis was accompanied with excruciating pains, and the mu&s;cular tunic of the urethra &s;o cri&s;pated, that the extremity of the glands was retracted inwards. The urine &s;pouted out in a &s;mall &s;tream, &s;lowly and with difficulty. Some time he experienced a &s;ort of retention, and never could eject it without pa&s;&s;ing a bougie in the neck of the bladder once a day.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t care was to relax the contracted parts; which I did by mucilaginous injections. In a week's time no pain was felt in erections; the &s;ummit of the glands again became proeminous, and the &s;calding was con&s;iderably abated.</P>
<P>Su&s;pecting the whole ma&s;s of the lymph to be infected, as the patient was rather of a plethoric complexion, I made him for a long while go through a cour&s;e of &s;udorific draughts.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">When his humours were judged well purified, I employed &s;up|purative remedies, as I have explained before, and in about three months time the ulcers were con&s;olidated.</P>
<P>There are now nearly five years that this gentleman has found him&s;elf perfectly cured. Ever &s;ince the difficulty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the difficulty of making water, which generally attends gleets, comes from any other cau&s;e but an irritation of the urethra; the removing of it requires a particular method.</NOTE> of making water has dimini&s;hed every day; and the&s;e eighteen months pa&s;t he did not need the introducing of a bougie in the neck of the bladder.</P>
<P>Such is the fir&s;t ca&s;e I was &s;peaking of: the &s;econd is &s;omewhat more &s;urprizing.</P>
<P>Mr. J. G. a celebrated arti&s;t,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Di&s;cretion is a part of the duty of a phy&s;ician: But although ever &s;o reluctant to &s;ee their names in public print, the gentlemen in que&s;tion will not decline to appear in &s;upport of truth, if a private interview was de&s;ired by patients. I have their word for it.</NOTE> having contracted a virulent gonorrhoea at <HI>Milan,</HI> was for &s;everal months in the hands of a &s;urgeon in that town, and left uncured. From <HI>Milan</HI> he went to <HI>Spain,</HI> and there was the &s;pace of twenty-five years under the hands of all tho&s;e who had any repute for curing venereal di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, all &s;orts of remedies were tried in turn, by every one of them, and at la&s;t a&s;tringents ra&s;hly made u&s;e of to &s;top the running, in order to have a pretence for payment.</P>
<P>The running once di&s;appeared for eleven months, but returned, without any apparent cau&s;e, more violently than ever; and ever &s;ince, till a few years ago, broke out again after indulging too freely in drinking.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">As the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e was the <HI>fo&s;&s;a navicularis,</HI> the urine was always pretty free; but all the other cruel &s;ymptoms attending gleets were felt.</P>
<P>Having laboured twenty-&s;even years under the&s;e complaints, and being left incurable, the patient applied to me. His di&s;ea&s;e was &s;o inveterate, that I entertained indeed &s;ome doubts of his recovery: I however ventured a fair tryal, and, to my great &s;urprize, after he had undergone a regular treatment for eleven weeks, he found him&s;elf entirely cured; at lea&s;t he has perceived, the&s;e two years pa&s;t, no appearance of a relap&s;e, although he has indulged his bottle. And I may boldly a&s;&s;ert, that, the running being not po&s;&s;ibly &s;topt by &s;uppuration, the ulcers are certainly healed, when they for a long &s;pace of time furni&s;h no matter.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with this ob&s;ervation, that, &s;ince a radical cure was effected in the two fore-mentioned ca&s;es, <HI>there is no gleet incurable: nay, there is none which cannot ea&s;ily and &s;peedily be cured, if properly treated.</HI></P>
