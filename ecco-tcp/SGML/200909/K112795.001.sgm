<P>TO offer to You, who are ma|nife&s;tly engaged in the mo&s;t u&s;eful and mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;tudies, a Collection of Fugitive Pieces, may perhaps at fir&s;t &s;ight appear to the

world as a flagrant impropriety, or at be&s;t but an ill-timed compli|ment.</P>
<P>But the truth is, it is not my de&s;ire to &s;helter the&s;e Papers under the Patron|age of the PRESIDENT of the ROYAL SOCIETY; but to &s;ei&s;e this opportunity of publickly te&s;tifying the &s;incere re|&s;pect and regard I entertain for your Character, and to acknowledge the Obligations that I owe to Sir JOSEPH BANKS.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations will, I tru&s;t, be received as an Apology by the Pub|lick, and will, I hope, induce You to pardon the liberty I have taken in
<PB REF="12">
reque&s;ting your friendly acceptance of the&s;e little volumes, as a faint pledge of the Veneration and Gratitude of,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>DRIVING the other day through the City&mdash;<HI>driving,</HI> for alas! at pre&s;ent wri|ting I cannot very well walk&mdash;I ob&s;erved, in different panes of the extended window of an eminent Linen-Draper, a con&s;picuous Bill, exhibiting the&s;e words in very large Charac|ters: THE GOODS OF THIS SHOP TO BE SOLD CHEAP, THE OWNER LEAVING OFF TRADE.</P>
<P>Though it is not my intention to &s;hut up Shop, and though I &s;hall not probably leave trade till life leaves me, yet meditating at that moment on the few pages nece&s;&s;ary to be prefixed to the&s;e Mi&s;cellaneous Volumes, I could not help comparing my Stock of E&s;&s;ays, Prefaces, Letters, Remarks, Odes, Epi&s;tles, Epigrams, Prologues, and Epi|logues, with other Literary Fragments, to
<PB N="vi" REF="14">
the Bales, Pieces, and Remnants, of my frriend the Linen-Draper.</P>
<P>In one re&s;pect indeed our &s;ituations are exactly &s;imilar; we are both obliged to evacuate our &s;everal warehou&s;es, and though we may both on this occa&s;ion bring forward &s;ome &s;tale commodities, yet we both offer all our prime goods much below prime co&s;t.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;ays a Critick, but your ca&s;e and that of your friend are not, as you pretend, exactly &s;imilar. He is under a nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;encumbering him&s;elf of all his wares, good, bad, or indifferent; but from you we have a right to expect and demand a <HI>Selection.</HI> Alas, my honoured Sir! a Selection is now out of my power. Many of the&s;e pieces, &s;ince fir&s;t printed and publi&s;hed, have been reprinted and republi&s;hed without the pri|vity or con&s;ent of the author; and ten to one, if the breath was out of his body, but &s;ome other collection of this &s;ort would
<PB N="vii" REF="15">
be offered to the Publick under his name, much le&s;s &s;elect than the pre&s;ent; &s;welled with articles, of which in the fir&s;t in&s;tance he was not the retailer or manufacturer, and for which he ought not, dead or alive, to be made or thought re&s;pon&s;ible.</P>
<P>Of the Contents of the&s;e Mi&s;cellanies a &s;hort Summary is given at the conclu&s;ion of each volume; yet it appears nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak more at large, in the &s;tyle of a <HI>Catalogue Rai&s;onn&eacute;e,</HI> of &s;ome of the Par|ticulars.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t volume con&s;i&s;ts entirely of E&s;&s;ays; a &s;tyle of writing to which the Au|thor has always betrayed a great propen&s;ity. This inclination led him, at a very early period, to offer the paper that opens the vo|lume to the conductors of THE ADVEN|TURER, who honoured it with acceptance and in&s;ertion, &s;ome time before the di&s;|&s;tingui&s;hed aera when the illu&s;trious Mr. Town introduced him&s;elf to the
<PB N="viii" REF="16">
notice of the Publick under the title of THE CONNOISSEUR.</P>
<P>The Series of Papers, under the names of THE GENIUS and THE GENTLEMAN, were chiefly undertaken with a view of promoting the intere&s;t of the Publications in which they appeared, and with &s;ome thoughts of longer duration; but other avocations intervening, they were di&s;continued as abruptly as they were begun. For every thing in the&s;e papers the Editor is re&s;pon&s;ible, except for the <HI>Epi&s;tle to a Friend</HI> at the conclu&s;ion of No. XI. written by Mr. Lloyd.</P>
<P>The numbers of <HI>TERRAE-FILIUS</HI> were written and publi&s;hed at the time of their &s;everal dates, during a party to Oxford in company with my old friends and &s;chool|fellows Thornton and Churchill: neither of whom however took any part in that publication, though Thornton on our re|turn frankly owned his regret at not having joined his old Co-adjutor.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="17">The &s;econd volume opens with a &s;tring of Letters and other articles, written for the &s;ame purpo&s;e as the main part of the E&s;&s;ays in the fir&s;t; acting in concert with men who&s;e names I loved, and who&s;e me|mories I revere. A certain &s;plenetick author, who confe&s;&s;edly dates the dawnings of his Genius from his juvenile effu&s;ions in a Weekly Journal, &s;peaks in his u&s;ual &s;tyle of Egoti&s;m with great contempt of the writers and &s;harers in News-Papers. For my part, not con&s;cious of having written any thing in them for which I ought to be a&s;hamed, I am free to confe&s;s my having written in them. Nor indeed ought <HI>He</HI> to blu&s;h at his earlie&s;t connections; but rather to pride him&s;elf, and a&s;&s;ume more con&s;equence than he now challenges, if po&s;&s;ible, from the reflection of having conveyed his Loo&s;e Thoughts and Tritical E&s;&s;ays to the Pub|lick through the &s;ame channel with the manly Lucubrations of Pulteney and Boling broke.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="18">The two Prefaces to the plays of Ma&s;&s;in|ger and Beaumont and Fletcher, though conveying no Literary Doctrines which I do not avow, are not however to be &s;trictly taken as coming from me as the Editor of either of tho&s;e Publications, for which I do not con&s;ider my&s;elf as re&s;pon&s;ible. The Critical Reflections were thrown together at the in&s;tance of Mr. Garrick, to &s;erve his old &s;ubject Davies; who, converted from an Actor into a Book&s;eller, had purcha&s;ed the remaining copies of Coxeter's Edition of the Works of Ma&s;&s;inger, to which he added the Critical Reflections as a Preface. Of the Edition of the Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher I never &s;aw a line, to the be&s;t of my recollection, till near two volumes were printed. I afterwards revi&s;ed the proof &s;heets, and by degrees intere&s;ted my&s;elf &s;till more in the publication; for which I had no other motive than the de&s;ire of preventing a probable lo&s;s to a per&s;on who had hazarded a very con&s;iderable &s;um on the undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="19">The Appendix to the &s;econd Edition of the Tran&s;lation of Terence is in&s;erted in the&s;e volumes, for the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned in the Po&s;t&s;cript to that Appendix, now fir&s;t publi&s;hed, to which Po&s;t&s;cript I beg leave to refer the reader.</P>
<P>In this detail of the &s;everal parts of this Compilation, one of the fir&s;t attempts at Ver&s;e that pre&s;ents it&s;elf is an Ode to Obli|livion and an Ode to Ob&s;curity; in &s;peaking of which I may &s;ay of this <HI>Farrago,</HI> as Othello of the &s;tory of his life,</P>
<Q>I ran it o'er ev'n from my boyi&s;h days.</Q>
<P>The&s;e Odes were indeed a piece of boys' play with my &s;choolfellow Lloyd, with whom they were written in concert, in tho&s;e days when we had &s;o little grace as to ridicule our Poetical Ma&s;ters, joking perhaps too licen|tiou&s;ly with the <HI>Prettyne&s;&s;es</HI> of one poet, and the <HI>Ob&s;curities</HI> of another. We were not however in&s;en&s;ible to their real merits and excellencies, nor de&s;irous to depreciate them: and if the time of the publication cannot
<PB N="xii" REF="20">
be admitted as an apology, it &s;hould be remembered that there are few writers who have not, in &s;ome part of their career, in|dulged them&s;elves in &s;imilar liberties, and been guilty of the like tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. Re|pentance in the&s;e ca&s;es, as in mo&s;t others, comes too late to redeem the offence. <HI>Ne&s;cit vox mi&s;&s;a reverti.</HI> The Elegy of ISIS, and the Poem of THE TRIUMPHS OF ISIS, are in vain excluded from the collections of their re&s;pective authors. They have been given to the world with the names of the writers, in other Mi&s;cellanies; and their native Spirit and Vigour has kept them alive, in &s;pite of the efforts of their unnatural parents to &s;tifle or overlay them.</P>
<P>THE LAW STUDENT has already been twice before the Publick, though not exactly in the &s;ame &s;hape as at pre&s;ent; fir&s;t in Lloyd's Poems, and afterwards in a collection en|titled, <HI>The Oxford Sau&s;age,</HI> entirely con&s;i&s;ting of pieces written by Oxonians. Lloyd was removed to Cambridge, as I was to Oxford;
<PB N="xiii" REF="21">
yet I was concerned in the fir&s;t of tho&s;e publications, and a &s;tranger to the &s;econd. The truth is that Lloyd wanted materials to fill a volume, undertaken by &s;ub&s;cription, and this little Poem contributed, with &s;ome variations, to &s;upply the deficiency.</P>
<P>The next article will perhaps at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;tartle the reader, THE ROLLIAD, <HI>an Heroick Poem!</HI> Familiar, however, as the title may appear to his ear and eye, he may be a&s;&s;ured that the pre&s;ent work had a being and a name long before the exi&s;tence of the popular and political work lately known under that title.</P>
<P>The reader I fear will &s;oon di&s;cover that there is no other affinity or &s;imilarity between the two poems. <HI>What's in a name?</HI> and even that name was given to the &s;everal works on different principles: for Commen|tators mu&s;t agree, that the Political ROLLIAD derives its title, like the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and the <HI>Henriade,</HI> from the name of the
<PB N="xiv" REF="22">
Hero; while <HI>our</HI> ROLLIAD owes its deno|mination to the greatne&s;s of the event or the action, like the <HI>Iliad,</HI> the <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t!</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Cobbler of Cripplegate's Letter to R. Lloyd</HI> was written in concert with Garrick, and with Churchill's knowledge and privity &s;ent to Lloyd for in&s;ertion in his monthly publication. Lloyd, on the receipt of it, con&s;ulted Churchill on the propriety of printing &s;uch an attack upon him&s;elf and his friends. In that point, &s;ays Churchill drily, you mu&s;t judge for your&s;elf. He did judge for him&s;elf, and publi&s;hed it: and con&s;idering the literary &s;quabbles of that period, which this Letter tended to ridicule, I think he judged rightly.</P>
<P>This article reminds me of mentioning what I had nearly forgot; that the Epigram at the end of the Cock-Lane Gho&s;t Intelli|gence was a <HI>jeu d'e&s;prit</HI> of Garrick.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="23">The recapitulation of &s;ome of the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances will perhaps be le&s;s intere&s;ting to the reader than to the writer, whom they affect mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly, by recalling to his mind the memory of many plea&s;ant hours never, never, to return!</P>
<Q><L>O Noctes, C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">n que De&ucirc;m!</L>
<L>&mdash;&s;ollicitae jucunda oblivia vitae.</L></Q>
<P>The &s;everal articles in the &s;econd and third volumes, di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Summary of Con|tents by an a&s;teri&s;k, were written &s;ince the work was fir&s;t committed to the pre&s;s, and were in|deed the chief amu&s;ements of the writer in the intervals of ea&s;e and lei&s;ure, during a &s;evere and long illne&s;s. Two or three of them (but two or three, and tho&s;e very &s;hort) have that illne&s;s for their &s;ubject; and the thirty-ninth P&s;alm comes &s;o clo&s;e to the original, which &s;o naturally re&s;olves it&s;elf into Blank Ver&s;e, that he is almo&s;t afraid of having mi&s;named it by &s;tyling it <HI>an Imitation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="24">The&s;e, and other additions, are now hum|bly offered to his readers, not without hopes of contributing to their entertainment. And indeed many parts of this collection have already been &s;o favourably received, that the writer is unwilling to &s;uppo&s;e, that by thus bringing together his detached pieces, he &s;hall be con&s;idered as binding twigs to compo&s;e a rod for him&s;elf, while he is amu&s;ed with the thoughts of mak|ing up a no&s;egay for his friends and for the Publick.</P>

<P>NOTHING &s;ooner quells the ridiculous tri|umph of human vanity, than reading tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of the greate&s;t writers in which they &s;eem deprived of that noble &s;pirit that in&s;pires them in other parts; and where, in&s;tead of invention and grandeur, we meet with nothing but flatne&s;s and in&s;ipidity.</P>
<P>The pain I have felt in ob&s;erving a lofty genius thus &s;ink beneath it&s;elf, has often made me wi&s;h
<PB N="2" REF="26">
that the&s;e unworthy &s;tains could be blotted from their works, and leave them perfect and immaculate.</P>
<P>I went to bed a few nights ago full of the&s;e thoughts, and clo&s;ed the evening, as I frequently do, with reading a few lines of Virgil. I acci|dentally opened that part of the &s;ixth book; where Anchi&s;es recounts to his &s;on the various methods of purgation which the &s;oul undergoes in the next world, to clean&s;e it from the filth it has contracted by its connections with the body, and to deliver the pure aetherial e&s;&s;ence from the vicious tincture of mortality. This was &s;o much like my evening's &s;peculation, that it in&s;en&s;ibly mixed and incorpo|rated with it, and as &s;oon as I fell a&s;leep formed it|&s;elf into the following dream.</P>
<P>I found my&s;elf in an in&s;tant in the mid&s;t of a temple, which was built with all that magnificent &s;implicity, that di&s;tingui&s;hes the productions of the ancients. At the Ea&s;t end was rai&s;ed an altar, on each &s;ide of which &s;tood a prie&s;t who &s;eemed pre|paring to &s;acrifice. On the altar was kindled a fire, from which aro&s;e the brighte&s;t flame I had ever beheld. The light which it di&s;pen&s;ed, though re|markably &s;trong and clear, was not quivering and dazzling, but &s;teady and uniform, and diffu&s;ed a purple radiance through the whole edifice, not un|like the fir&s;t appearance of the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="27">While I &s;tood fixed in admiration, my attention was awakened by the bla&s;t of a trumpet that &s;hook the whole temple; but it carried a certain &s;weet|ne&s;s in its &s;ound, which mellowed and tempered the natural &s;hrillne&s;s of that in&s;trument. After it had &s;ounded thrice, the Being who blew it, ha|bited according to the de&s;cription of Fame by the ancients, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation to the following purpo&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"By command of Apollo and the Mu|&s;es, all who have ever made any preten&s;ions to fame by their writings are enjoined to &s;acrifice upon the altar in this temple tho&s;e parts of their works, which have hitherto been pre&s;erved to their infamy; that their names may de&s;cend &s;potle&s;s and un&s;ullied to po&s;terity. For this purpo&s;e Ari&s;totle and Longinus are appointed chief prie&s;ts, who are to &s;ee that no improper oblations are made, and no proper ones con|cealed; and, for the more ea&s;y performance of this office, they are allowed to chu&s;e as their a&s;&s;i&s;tants whom&s;oever they &s;hall think worthy of the function."</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as this proclamation was made I turned my eyes with inexpre&s;&s;ible delight towards the two prie&s;ts; but was &s;oon robbed of the plea|&s;ure of looking at them by a croud of people
<PB N="4" REF="28">
running up to offer their &s;ervice. The&s;e I found to be a groupe of French criticks; but their offers were rejected by both prie&s;ts with the utmo&s;t indig|nation, and their whole works were thrown on the altar, and reduced to a&s;hes in an in&s;tant. The two prie&s;ts then looked round, and cho&s;e with a few others Horace and Quintilian from among the Romans, and Addi&s;on from the Engli&s;h, as their principal a&s;&s;i&s;tants.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t who came forward with his offering, by the loftine&s;s of his demeanor was &s;oon di&s;covered to be Homer. He approached the altar with great maje&s;ty, and delivered to Longinus tho&s;e parts of his Ody&s;&s;ey, which have been cen&s;ured as improba|ble fictions, and the ridiculous narratives of old age. Longinus was preparing for the &s;acrifice; but ob&s;erving that Ari&s;totle did not &s;eem willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the office, he returned them to the venerable old bard with great deference, &s;aying that <Q REND="inline">"they were indeed the tales of old age, but it was the old age of Homer."</Q></P>
<P>Virgil appeared next, and approached the altar with a mode&s;t dignity in his gait and counte|nance peculiar to him&s;elf, and to the &s;urpri&s;e of all committed his whole Aeneid to the flames. But it was immediately re&s;cued by two Romans, who ran
<PB N="5" REF="29">
with precipitation to the altar, delivered the poem from de&s;truction, and carried off the author between them, repeating that glorious boa&s;t of about forty lines at the beginning of the third Georgick.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Tentanda via e&s;t; qu&acirc; me quoque po&s;&s;im</L>
<L>Tollere humo, victorque vir&ucirc;m volitare per ora.</L>
<L>Primus ego in patriam mecum &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>After him mo&s;t of the Greek and Roman authors proceeded to the altar, and &s;urrendered with great mode&s;ty and humility the mo&s;t faulty part of their works. One circum&s;tance was ob&s;ervable; that the &s;acrifice always increa&s;ed, in proportion as the author had ventured to deviate from a judicious imitation of Homer. The latter Roman authors, who &s;eemed almo&s;t to have lo&s;t &s;ight of him, made &s;o large offerings, that &s;ome of their works, which were before very voluminous, &s;hrunk into the compa&s;s of a primer.</P>
<P>It gave me the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction to &s;ee philo|&s;ophy thus cleared from erroneous principles, hi&s;tory purged of fal&s;ehood, poetry of fu&s;tian, and nothing left in each but genius, &s;en&s;e and truth. I marked with particular attention the &s;everal offerings of the mo&s;t eminent Engli&s;h writers. Chaucer gave up his ob&s;cenity, and then delivered
<PB N="6" REF="30">
his works to Dryden to clear them from the rubbi&s;h that encumbered them. Dryden executed his ta&s;k with great addre&s;s, and, as Addi&s;on &s;ays of Virgil in his Georgicks, <Q REND="inline">"to&s;&s;ed about his dung with an air of gracefulne&s;s."</Q> He not only repaired the injuries of time, but threw in a thou&s;and new graces. He then advanced towards the altar him&s;elf, and delivered up a large paquet which contained many plays, and &s;ome poems. The paquet had a label affixed to it which bore this in|&s;cription, <Q REND="inline">"To Poverty."</Q></P>
<P>Shake&s;peare carried to the altar a long &s;tring of puns marked <Q REND="inline">"The ta&s;te of the age,"</Q> a &s;mall par|cel of bomba&s;t, and a pretty large bundle of in|correctne&s;s. Notwith&s;tanding the ingenuous air with which he made this offering, &s;ome officiates at the altar accu&s;ed him of concealing certain pieces, and mentioned the London Prodigal, Sir Thomas Cromwell, the York&s;hire Tragedy, &amp;c. The poet replied, that <Q REND="inline">"as tho&s;e pieces were unworthy to be pre&s;erved, he &s;hould &s;ee them con&s;umed to a&s;hes with great plea&s;ure, but that he was wholly in|nocent of their original."</Q> The two chief prie&s;ts interpo&s;ed in this di&s;pute, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the poet with many compliments; Longinus ob&s;erving that the pieces in que&s;tion could not po&s;&s;ibly be his, for
<PB N="7" REF="31">
that the failings of Shake&s;peare were like tho&s;e of Homer, <Q REND="inline">"who&s;e genius, whenever it &s;ub&s;ided, might be compared to the ebbing of the ocean, which left a mark upon its &s;hores to &s;hew to what a height it was &s;ometimes carried."</Q> Ari&s;totle concurred in this opinion, and added <Q REND="inline">"that although Shake&s;peare was quite ignorant of that exact oeconomy of the &s;tage, which is &s;o remarkable in the Greek writers, yet the meer &s;trength of his genius had in many points car|ried him infinitely beyond them."</Q></P>
<P>Milton gave up a few errors in his Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, and the &s;acrifice was attended with great de|cency by Addi&s;on. Otway and Rowe threw their comedies upon the altar, and Beaumont and Fletcher the two la&s;t acts of many of their pieces. They were followed by Tom Durfey, Etherege, Wycherley, and &s;everal other dramatic writers, who made &s;uch large contributions that they &s;et the altar in a blaze.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e I was &s;urprized to &s;ee an author, with much politene&s;s in his behaviour and &s;pirit in his countenance, tottering under an unwieldy burden. As he approached I di&s;covered him to be Sir John Vanbrugh, and could not but &s;mile, when
<PB N="8" REF="32">
on his committing his heavy load to the flames, it proved to be <Q REND="inline">"his &s;kill in architecture."</Q></P>
<P>Pope advanced towards Addi&s;on, and delivered with great humility tho&s;e lines written expre&s;sly again&s;t him, &s;o remarkable for their excellence and their cruelty, repeating this couplet;</P>
<Q><L>Cur&s;t be the ver&s;e, how well &s;oe'er it flow</L>
<L>That tends to make one worthy man my foe.</L></Q>
<P>The ingenious critick in&s;i&s;ted on his taking them again, <Q REND="inline">"for"</Q> &s;aid he <Q REND="inline">"my a&s;&s;ociates at the altar, particularly Horace, would never permit a line of &s;o excellent a &s;atiri&s;t to be con&s;umed. The many compliments paid me in other parts of your works amply compen&s;ate for this &s;light in|dignity; and be a&s;&s;ured, that no little pique or mi&s;under&s;tanding &s;hall ever make me a foe to genius."</Q> Pope bowed in &s;ome confu&s;ion, and promi&s;ed to &s;ub&s;titute a fictitious name at lea&s;t, which was all that was left in his power. He then retired, after having made a &s;acrifice of a little paquet of Antithe&s;es, and &s;ome parts of his tran&s;lation of Homer.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of the&s;e oblations, I was charmed with the candour, decency, and judgment, with which all the prie&s;ts di&s;charged their different functions. They behaved with &s;uch dignity that it
<PB N="9" REF="33">
reminded me of tho&s;e ages, when the offices of king and prie&s;t centered in the &s;ame per&s;on. Whenever any of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants were at a lo&s;s in any particular circum&s;tances, they applied to Ari&s;totle, who &s;ettled the whole bu&s;ine&s;s in an in|&s;tant.</P>
<P>But the reflections, which this plea&s;ing &s;cene produced, were &s;oon interrupted by a tumultuous noi&s;e at the gate of the temple; when &s;uddenly a rude illiterate multitude ru&s;hed in, led by Tindal, Morgan, Chubb and Bolingbroke. The chiefs, who&s;e countenances were impre&s;&s;ed with rage whch art could not conceal, forced their way to the altar, and amid&s;t the joyful acclamations of their followers threw a large volume into the fire. But the triumph was &s;hort, and joy and acclamation gave way to &s;ilence and a&s;toni&s;hment. The Vo|lume lay unhurt in the mid&s;t of the fire, and, as the flames played innocently about it, I could di&s;|cover, written in letters of gold, the words THE BIBLE. At that in&s;tant my ears were ravi&s;hed with the &s;ound of more than mortal mu&s;ick, accompany|ing a hymn, &s;ung by invi&s;ible beings, of which I well remember the following ver&s;es:</P>
<Q><P>The words of the Lord are pure words: even as the &s;ilver, which in the earth is tried, and purified &s;even times in the fire.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="34">More to be de&s;ired are they than gold; yea, than much fine gold; &s;weeter al&s;o than honey, and the honey-comb.</P></Q>
<P>The united melody of in&s;truments and voices, which formed a concert &s;o exqui&s;ite, that as Milton &s;ays <Q REND="inline">"it might create a &s;oul under the ribs of death,"</Q> threw me into &s;uch exta&s;ies, that I was awakened by their violence.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A GENIUS is a character purely modern, and of &s;o late an origin, that it has never yet been de&s;cribed or defined in any treati&s;e, e&s;|&s;ay, lexicon, or dictionary. It is now, however, become almo&s;t univer&s;al. The originals are, in|deed, &s;o numerous, and the features &s;o &s;trong, that it requires but little &s;kill to take an exact like|ne&s;s. I am my&s;elf an acknowledged GENIUS; and &s;ince it is no more than drawing my own picture, I cannot better introduce my&s;elf to the reader, than by giving at one &s;troke a rough draught of my own character, and that of the nu|merous fraternity, by way of preliminary paper, or fronti&s;piece, if you plea&s;e, to the en&s;uing &s;pe|culations.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="36">The ancients, according to their wonted nar|rowne&s;s of &s;oul, honoured a very &s;mall portion of the human race with this appellation. He, who to extraordinary talents had added extraordinary application, after the mo&s;t arduous efforts to|wards excellence in &s;ome one art or &s;cience, was perhaps at la&s;t fortunate enough to extort this di&s;|tinction. The more generous moderns demand only the fir&s;t requi&s;ites; and even tho&s;e, like the places of men ballotted into the militia, may be &s;upplied by &s;ub&s;titutes. Vanity or a&s;&s;urance may pa&s;s, in the modern mu&s;ter, for &s;uperior faculties. The GENIUS, endowed with them, needs neither diligence nor a&s;&s;iduity. Supported by confidence, he di&s;dains to halt along on the crutches of application. So far from being ver&s;ed merely in one &s;cience, he runs round the whole circle at his plea&s;ure. Knowledge is rained down on his head like manna from heaven, and he has no care but to gather it as it falls. Almo&s;t every man is an adept in every art; acquires learning without &s;tudy; improves his good &s;en&s;e without meditation; writes without reading; and, being full as well acquainted with one thing as another, is an un|que&s;tionable GENIUS; or, what is more extraordi|nary, maintains his right to that title without know|ing, or even pretending to know, any thing at all.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="37">There is a certain reverend and affecting biogra|pher in this town, who pens, almo&s;t every &s;ix weeks, the memoirs of &s;everal unfortunate great men, and among them of many a GENIUS. In order to &s;hew the characters of his heroes at full length, he takes up their adventures, <HI>e'en from their boyi&s;h days,</HI> and fairly &s;ets down a plain account of their life, character, and behaviour, beginning with their birth, parentage, and education; &s;o that the reader may &s;ee at one glance, by what &s;teps they have gained the top-mo&s;t round of the ladder. In imitation of &s;o great an example, I will endeavour to trace the GENIUS almo&s;t from his birth to his &s;ublime&s;t &s;tage of excellence. GENIUS is, indeed, univer&s;ally allowed to be the gift of nature: we cannot therefore be &s;urpri&s;ed to find it, like Hercules, exerting its &s;trength in the cradle.</P>
<P>The cradle, indeed, may be con&s;idered as a mere hot-bed for the rai&s;ing of GENIUS; which is a plant of &s;o delicate a nature, that it is often nipt in the bud. There never was a child, as its pa|rents will tell you, who did not &s;oon give evident tokens of the brighte&s;t parts, by doing and &s;aying ten thou&s;and witty things, which were never done or &s;aid before &s;ince the infancy of Cain and Abel.
<PB N="14" REF="38">
The wit of a child, like that of a monkey, (which is a very wi&s;e animal, and, we are told, could &s;peak if it would) con&s;i&s;ts in mi&s;chief; and the more &s;pirit little ma&s;ter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, the more enter|taining he is to the company. I remember, that I was once taken &s;o much notice of for my wit and humour in pulling off a grave gentleman's wig, that it afterwards betrayed me into &s;everal &s;crapes, by playing the &s;ame tricks over again upon dull fellows, who had not &s;uch &s;trong ideas of plea&s;antry. It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve here, that practical &s;trokes of humour are tho&s;e, in which a GENIUS takes the mo&s;t delight.</P>
<P>At &s;chool the young GENIUS will begin to heighten our expectations of his future abilities. His parts, indeed, will be too brilliant to attend the in&s;truc|tions he might receive there; but his &s;pirit will have more room to di&s;play it&s;elf. He may be at the bottom of his cla&s;s, but he will be at the head of every &s;crape. He may be deficient in Greek and Latin, make fal&s;e concord in his pro&s;e, and be guilty of fal&s;e quantities in his ver&s;e; yet, before he leaves &s;chool, he will not be unacquainted with the world, will walk familiarly into a tavern, know the be&s;t &s;ongs at Comus's court, and the names and per&s;ons of the kinde&s;t ladies upon town. But,
<PB N="15" REF="39">
when once relieved from &s;chola&s;tick re&s;traints, as his &s;phere will be more noble, his fame will be|come more eminent. If he is entered at either of our univer&s;ities, the tamene&s;s of an academical life being ill adapted to the vivacity of his di&s;po|&s;ition, he will &s;pend all his time in Covent Garden by way of being in genteel company. If he is &s;ent abroad, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, his wi&s;e parents or guardians imagine that the di&s;cipline of our own univer&s;ities is not &s;trict enough, he will &s;oon convince them that the government of foreign academies is infinitely more lax. He will &s;peedily di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by his uncommon &s;pirit; and after &s;hooting a waiter, killing his friend in a duel, or perhaps contaminating the &s;ixty de&s;cents in the hou&s;e of a German baron by decoying his daughter, he may ride po&s;t out of the continent, and be glad to embark in a &s;torm in order to get &s;afe footing in Old England.</P>
<P>Old England is, indeed, the noble&s;t theatre in the univer&s;e for a GENIUS. Here he may go through all the changes and diver&s;ities of his character at plea|&s;ure. Here he may &s;end his mi&s;tre&s;s to parade through the &s;treets in a gilt chariot, drawn by pye|bald hor&s;es; he may at the &s;ame time be &s;o deeply engaged at play, that his own chariot may
<PB N="16" REF="40">
&s;tand at the door of Arthur's till eight in the morn|ing. He may ride his own matches at Newmarket, and perform new miracles again&s;t time and weight, and number of hor&s;es, every &s;ea&s;on. In a word, he may indulge his vivacity in every ebullition of GE|NIUS, from to&s;&s;ing off his quarts of champagne, to &s;hooting him&s;elf through the head.</P>
<P>With this &s;pirit and vivacity may a GENIUS of quality and e&s;tate employ him&s;elf: but as talents are the gift of nature, and riches the mere favours of fortune, it happens unluckily, that many a GENIUS is reduced to the mean re&s;ources of trade or profe&s;&s;ion to &s;upport him&s;elf. In the&s;e ca&s;es, if the warmth of a GENIUS is not abated, it involves him in many difficulties. The &s;pirit of the clerk in a compting-hou&s;e may perhaps betray him into a for|gery; and the evil GENIUS of the apprentice may tempt him to commit depredations on the till.</P>
<P>The young phy&s;ician of GENIUS, in&s;tead of throwing that &s;olemnity into his countenance, which would make him look as if he had him&s;elf taken the potion he &s;hould pre&s;cribe, adopts a whim&s;ical air, and &s;oon lo&s;es his credit with the old practitioners, the apothecaries, and his bro|ther-attendants at the ho&s;pital, by laughing at the farce of phy&s;ick, and &s;wearing that water-gruel is
<PB N="17" REF="41">
of infinitely more &s;ervice than the whole Materia Medica. A GENIUS of this &s;pecies &s;ometimes re|trieves him&s;elf by recurring irregularly to phy&s;ick, and hawking a <HI>no&s;trum.</HI></P>
<P>The lively &s;tudent at the inns of court has too &s;ublime a turn of mind to follow his profe&s;&s;ion. He gives the attornies a contempt for him by en|deavouring to conver&s;e with them facetiou&s;ly; and is &s;een walking the &s;treets in an illegal bag-wig, in&s;tead of prudently wearing the bu&s;ine&s;s-following bob. He may be found oftener behind the &s;cenes at the play-hou&s;e, than in the courts of ju&s;tice; and if he is a prodigious GENIUS indeed, he even writes for the &s;tage.</P>
<P>The exploits of a modern GENIUS in high life are indeed no where to be equalled, except by the pro|ductions of a modern GENIUS in low life, as an author. His works are not to be e&s;timated accord|ing to the quality, but the quantity of them; and they are &s;old, whole&s;ale and retail, to one &s;et of book&s;ellers, as another &s;et of book&s;ellers in Moorfields &s;ell tho&s;e of his predece&s;&s;ors&mdash;by the pound. He is not only capable of writing in any &s;cience, but he will undertake to write in all &s;ciences at once. He will publi&s;h in one day detached parcels of biography, architecture,
<PB N="18" REF="42">
hu&s;bandry, gardening, and cookery. He will be, at one and the &s;ame time, the author of a long hi&s;tory, the tran&s;lator of a voluminous foreign writer, the inventor of a novel, the conductor of a review, the Doer of a magazine, and the manager of a news-paper. In compari&s;on to him, Tully &s;hall appear to have written a volume no bigger than the primer, and the Iliad &s;hall &s;hrink into a nut&s;hell. Longinus, from his great learn|ing, was denominated a walking mu&s;aeum; and our GENIUS, from the number and quality of his pro|ductions, may be more familiarly &s;tiled a cir|culating library.</P>
<P>Such an author am I, the GENIUS. Hi&s;tory &s;hall &s;tand &s;till for events, and I will tran&s;cribe the news-papers, as the annals of politicks and lite|rature, 'ere my pen &s;hall cea&s;e to go on. Loo&s;e papers, &s;uch as the&s;e, will &s;carce engage the atten|tion of a moment, and will be ha&s;tily &s;cribbled over at the tea-table, ju&s;t when the whim &s;hall &s;ieze me, or any amu&s;ing thoughts come uppermo&s;t in the whirl of my imagination. The reader there|fore mu&s;t not expect me at certain periods, &s;ince I &s;hall always pop abruptly in upon him. Some|times he may &s;ee me once, &s;ometimes twice, in a week; and &s;ometimes perhaps not above once in a
<PB N="19" REF="43">
fortnight. I hope to wait on him again very &s;oon; and, as I have here &s;aid &s;omething of my di&s;po&s;ition and &s;ituation, I propo&s;e in my next to give an exact de&s;cription of my per&s;on.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the eminent advan|tages re&s;ulting from the many rare talents and qualities nece&s;&s;arily included in that illu&s;trious character de&s;cribed in my fir&s;t paper, under the title of a GENIUS, I am, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, neither the mo&s;t completely happy, nor mo&s;t univer&s;ally ac|compli&s;hed man in the creation. Nature, who has in &s;ome in&s;tances been lavi&s;h in her bounties to me, has in others been rather too unkind, and indeed remarkably niggard of her favours. Vanity, for example, &s;he has &s;o exuberantly poured upon me, that my portion, to &s;ay no more of it, is at lea&s;t &s;ufficient to embolden me to venture forth as an author; and yet my &s;en&s;ibility is, at the &s;ame time, unfortunately &s;o nice and exqui&s;ite, that it
<PB N="20" REF="44">
becomes a perpetual thorn in the &s;ides of that very vanity, laying it open to every &s;light attack, and rendering it too ea&s;ily wounded by the petulance of folly, the &s;landers of envy, the gro&s;s je&s;ts of buf|foonery, or the malice of a review.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t drawback, which nature has, in my ca&s;e, made on that vanity and &s;elf-applau&s;e, which contributes more or le&s;s to the happine&s;s of every man and woman in the world, is mo&s;t unfor|tunately external; vi&s;ible to all eyes, open to ge|neral ob&s;ervation, and liable to ridicule from the dulle&s;t fellow, that ca&s;ts a look upon my per&s;on. Peculiarities of figure, whether in make, &s;ize, or complection, have always been deemed an inex|hau&s;tible &s;ource of ridicule to the a&s;&s;ociates of the man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them.

of the greate&s;t &s;cholars in Europe. Mr. Chilling|worth was of a &s;tature little &s;uperior to Mr. Hales.

Of Sir Lucius Carey, afterwards lord Falkland, who was but little taller than Sidney Godolphin, he &s;peaks &s;o highly, that I cannot re&s;i&s;t the tempta|tion of gratifying my&s;elf and all other little men by tran&s;cribing the de&s;cription of his per&s;on, hoping it may &s;erve to recommend us to the favour of the world, and particularly to the good graces of the ladies, who are de&s;ired to take notice, that Sir Lucius married for love, and made a mo&s;t ex|cellent hu&s;band.

His &s;tature was low, and &s;maller than mo&s;t men; his motion not graceful; and his a&s;pect &s;o far from inviting, that it bad &s;omewhat in it of &s;implicity: and his voice the wor&s;t of the three, and &s;o untuned, that in&s;tead of reconciling, it offended the ears, &s;o that no body

That little per&s;on and &s;mall &s;tature was quickly found to contain a great heart, a courage &s;o keen, and a nature &s;o fearle&s;s, that no compo&s;ition of the &s;tronge&s;t limbs, and mo&s;t harmonious and proportioned pre&s;ence and &s;trength, ever more di&s;po&s;ed any man to the greate&s;t en|terpri&s;e; it being his greate&s;t weakne&s;s to be too &s;olicitous for &s;uch adventures: and that untuned tongue and voice, ea&s;ily di&s;covered it&s;elf to be &s;up|plied, and governed, by a mind and under&s;tand|ing &s;o excellent, that the wit and weight of all he &s;aid, carried another kind of lu&s;tre, and admiration in it, and even another kind of acceptation from the per&s;ons pre&s;ent, than any ornament of delivery could rea&s;onably promi&s;e it&s;elf, or is u&s;ually at|tended with; and his di&s;po&s;ition and nature was &s;o gentle and obliging, &s;o much delighted in courte&s;y, kindne&s;s, and genero&s;ity, that all man|kind could not but admire and love him."</Q></P>

<P>I AM a plain man, but I can &s;ee how this world goes for all that; and, indeed, to find out where the &s;hoe pinches, requires no very fine

feelings in him that wears it. My grievance is no &s;mall one I a&s;&s;ure you. Give me leave, therefore, to &s;ubmit my ca&s;e to you and the publick; a ca&s;e which affects not my&s;elf alone, but, more or le&s;s, many thou&s;ands al&s;o of hone&s;t peaceable married men in his maje&s;ty's dominions.</P>
<P>The family matter which I have to lay before you, is relative to dre&s;s; an article which you periodical &s;peculati&s;ts have always made a particu|lar object of your animadversion. Do not ima|gine, &s;ir, that I trouble you merely to vent my &s;pleen again&s;t &s;ome new fa&s;hion, that I have di&s;|covered &s;ome unfore&s;een inconveniences in the leaving off hoops, or mean to declaim again&s;t the immode&s;ty of going without &s;tays. I do not care one farthing whether petticoats are long or &s;hort, &s;tomachers high or low, or whether the innume|rable yards of rich &s;tuff are employed in trimming or flouncing, or in &s;weeping the ground. I have no quarrel or concern with the vagaries of the fa&s;hion; all I complain of is the exorbitant ex|pence of a woman's dre&s;s, let the fa&s;hion be what it will; an expence &s;o enormous, that I can clothe my&s;elf and four boys from top to toe, for le&s;s than one third of the money, that goes to deck out my wife, who prote&s;ts after all, to every other
<PB N="33" REF="57">
woman &s;he &s;ees, that &s;he has not a gown to her back.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, &s;ir, that the greater part of my life has been &s;pent in mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s, in which I got together a very con&s;iderable fortune, and which I was at la&s;t prevailed on to quit by my wife's continued remon&s;trances, that my applica|tion to it injured my health; though I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, I have &s;carce known a happy hour &s;ince I quitted my compting-hou&s;e. Still, however, I con&s;ider, as every man ought, that a <HI>&s;hilling is a &s;erious thing,</HI> and keep a regular account of my family expences. In&s;tead of allowing my wife <HI>pin-money,</HI> as it is called, I pay all her bills, milli|ners, mercers, &amp;c. and carry them to the <HI>bad</HI> &s;ide of my accounts with my own hand; and it grieves me to the heart to &s;ee &s;o much good money lavi&s;hed away upon gew-gaws and frippery, things ten times wor&s;e than canvas, &s;tay-tape, and buck|ram in a tailor's bill. Such a cloud of ruffles, double-ruffles, treble-ruffles, caps, aprons, and handkerchiefs! Such a deluge of gauze, mu&s;lin, blond, and Bru&s;&s;els lace! and then from Ludgate-Hill rich &s;ilks at &s;o high a price! at the rate of&mdash;I blu&s;h to own it&mdash;even of twenty &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> yard! though, indeed, I remember when I
<PB N="34" REF="58">
could have purcha&s;ed whole bales of the &s;ame &s;or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> for no more than three or four, till the coxcombs of my own &s;ex enhanced the price, by making them up into fools-coats and birthday &s;uits for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This, Sir, you will allow to be a heavy expence; yet, all this is nothing, ab&s;olutely nothing, in com|pari&s;on to the grand object of my pre&s;ent appli|cation. After my wife's efforts at finery and magnificence had taken, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, their full &s;wing, &s;he made another &s;troke, which my folly and compliance has &s;uffered her, by little and little, to carry to &s;uch an immoderate length, that this new piece of extravagance has co&s;t me &s;everal thou&s;and pounds in hard money. Unfortunately for me, a little &s;crub Jew, who called him&s;elf a merchant, becau&s;e he carried on a &s;ort of pedlar's traffick in jewels among his tribe, u&s;ed to dine &s;ometimes at my hou&s;e, and &s;oon contrived to talk my good woman into a ta&s;te for diamonds; a &s;criv|ener's wife too in the neighbourhood happened at that time to have jewels in her ears; &s;o that, to humour my wife, little Tubal was ordered to furni&s;h. her with a pair of diamond tops, for &s;o I think they called them. The&s;e, however, were &s;carce purcha&s;ed, and the tops well fixt in her ears,
<PB N="35" REF="59">
before it was found indi&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite to have bobs or drops to them, which al&s;o the in&s;inuating Smou&s;e &s;oon provided for her. The good humour which the&s;e occa&s;ioned, was but of &s;hort dura|tion; for, alas, Sir, my wife &s;oon told me, that the&s;e were but poor trumpery baubles, and at be&s;t only fit for her <HI>di&s;habille</HI>; and, as a lady of quality had promi&s;ed to take her to court, it was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould have a pair of large hand&s;ome ear-rings; which by the help of our friend, &s;he &s;oon had, and which were &s;o very brilliant, and &s;et in &s;uch a fine tran&s;parent fa&s;hion, that the counte&s;s, who was to accompany her, turned pale with envy at the fight of them. Since then, Sir, I am a&s;hamed to confe&s;s to you, that I have been teazed and wheedled into giving her a diamond necklace, with an appurtenance dangling to it, which the charge in the bill has taught me to call <HI>E&s;clavage</HI>; and &s;ince that again, a diamond girdle-buckle, a pair of diamond &s;hoe-buckles, a &s;prig made up of garnets and diamonds, and what provokes me wor&s;e than all the re&s;t, a diamond no&s;egay or <HI>bouquet</HI> (as &s;he chri&s;tens it) which comes to more than a younger child's for|tune. Her affection for me has al&s;o induced her to wear my picture in miniature, &s;et round with
<PB N="36" REF="60">
diamonds, for a bracelet; be&s;ides which, her fingers are perfectly cramped with rings, &s;ingle brilliants, hoop-rings, topazes and amethy&s;ts without num|ber. She has &s;carcely the free motion of her knuckles and joints: they are placed five, &s;ix, &s;even, or eight deep below one another, and it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for her to wear more, unle&s;s, like the Indian women, &s;he was al&s;o to bore her no&s;e.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is the groaning evil of my wife's dre&s;s: and my ca&s;e, which might once have been reckoned &s;ingular, now becomes every day le&s;s and le&s;s uncommon. Formerly, indeed, rich jewels, as they &s;hine in the crown of monarchs, &s;eemed al&s;o to be appropriated to tho&s;e illu&s;trious characters, which approached neare&s;t to that rank and dignity: but now they are worn indi&s;criminately by the wife of a duke or a city-deputy, by a prince&s;s of the blood or a lady of plea&s;ure. I can remember the time when women of an ordinary rank never dreamt of &s;uch extravagance, when they were con|tented with pebbles and pa&s;te in&s;tead of diamonds, wore French beads for pearls, and coloured gla&s;s for precious &s;tones. At pre&s;ent every woman &s;eems as familiar with diamonds as Cleopatra was of old; and to hear them boa&s;t how cheap and plentiful they are grown of late years in England, one
<PB N="37" REF="61">
would almo&s;t imagine, that they were inhabitants of Voltaire's good country of Eldorado, where (as I read lately in a tran&s;lation of his Candide) the &s;oil con&s;i&s;ted of gold, and diamonds lay, like &s;tones and pebbles, in the &s;treets and highways.</P>
<P>My good wife is plea&s;ed at times to expatiate on the oeconomy and good management of laying out money on the&s;e trinkets. They are, &s;ays &s;he, the only parts of dre&s;s, who&s;e value remains undimini&s;hed, and on which the co&s;t is not entirely thrown away. They have an intrin&s;ick worth; and they, as well as plate, may be regarded as &s;o much riches in bank, which, like a note, may be converted into ca&s;h, whenever one plea&s;es. This is fine talking truly! It is well known, that the &s;etting, and the fa&s;hion, and the like, come to above half the money that is paid for them; though indeed the expence is &s;o great, taken altogether, that the buyer is often obliged to try the real value of his purcha&s;es by &s;etting his jewels up to auction, and coining his plate, like the bankrupt Frenchman, into &s;pecie. For my part I never &s;ee my wife in all her finery, without being immediately led to a contemplation of the immen&s;e &s;ums, which &s;he carries about her. When I con&s;ider the common rate of intere&s;t, I cannot help calculating, her
<PB N="38" REF="62">
ears, her neck, her hands, and her feet, each at &s;o much <HI>per annum,</HI> and when I further reflect how much more <HI>per cent.</HI> I could have made of my money in the fair way of trade, &s;he &s;eems to lie, like &s;ome cruel exci&s;e, upon my goods. A merchant can &s;carce ever afford to make a purcha&s;e even of Land, his whole principal being wanted to an&s;wer the demands of his bu&s;ine&s;s. How then can he &s;upport the lo&s;s of &s;o much money lying dead on his wife's toilet? What profit can ari&s;e from her ear-rings or &s;hoe-buckles? and where are his quick returns from her &s;prig or her <HI>bouquet?</HI> &s;hould he &s;uffer a bill of exchange to be prote&s;ted, in order to pay his lady's jeweller? or &s;hould he run the ri&s;k of &s;eeing the precious &s;tones them&s;elves in the hands of his a&s;&s;ignees? An e&s;tate in land indeed will afford &s;ome profit to the owner of it: but the barren brilliants produce neither corn nor gra&s;s, yield neither rent nor habitation, and &s;erve no one end (on this &s;ide of Temple-Bar at lea&s;t) except that of making the hu&s;band poor, and the wife proud.</P>
<P>The bad effect which the&s;e ornaments have on the minds of the wearers, might furni&s;h no weak arguments again&s;t the u&s;e of them. So much finery mu&s;t be &s;hewn, and for what end does a woman
<PB N="39" REF="63">
dre&s;s, unle&s;s it be in order to be &s;een? With what tran&s;port did my wife attend to the city &s;cheme of an a&s;&s;embly at Haberda&s;her's-Hall! where, I dare &s;ay, her magnificence has &s;ince created no &s;mall di&s;quiet in the family of many an alderman. I have already been reproached by more than one of the common council on this occa&s;ion, who have them&s;elves &s;hewn no more power to check this do|me&s;tick evil than I exerted. They talk, however, very loudly of the imprudence of tru&s;ting a wife with &s;uch valuables: they tell me, it is ab&s;olutely putting an independent fortune into her hands. I have heard twenty &s;tories of diamond-necklaces and aigrets being &s;ent by di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ladies to the pawnbroker's; and my attorney a&s;&s;ures me, that he has the jewels of a lady of quality lying in his &s;trong box, as a pledge for a thou&s;and pounds lo&s;t at play, for which &s;he had too much tenderne&s;s to trouble her hu&s;band. I have al&s;o heard another &s;tory of a lady who robbed her&s;elf, and prevailed on her kind hu&s;band to purcha&s;e for her a &s;econd time <HI>her own</HI> diamonds, new-&s;et, of the jeweller, who had received the &s;tolen goods at her hands.</P>
<P>You, Mr. Genius, &s;eem to me to be &s;omething of a wag, and &s;o perhaps you may laugh at my remon&s;trances; but in my mind it is a very &s;erious
<PB N="40" REF="64">
affair, and de&s;erves much con&s;ideration. To bring in a bill for &s;ome wi&s;e &s;umptuary law would perhaps not be quite unworthy the attention of the legi&s;lature. I con&s;ulted a &s;erjeant at law &s;ome time ago on this head. He informed me, that, in the uncommon extent of his reading, he had met with a recital of one or two laws of this nature, but that they had been ob&s;olete time out of mind. In one of the&s;e it was declared how many rows of lace a man might wear on his coat, according to his degree, from a duke to an e&s;quire: and in another it was &s;olemnly enacted, that no per&s;on, beneath the rank of a peer, &s;hould wear a coat &s;o &s;hort as to &s;hew his po&s;teriors.</P>
<P>This, Sir, was the &s;um of the grave gentle|man's coun&s;el: hoping al&s;o &s;ome whole&s;ome ad|vice from you, or at lea&s;t that my ca&s;e may induce you to draw up a table of &s;umptuary laws for the benefit of the ladies, or, more properly &s;peaking, for the benefit of their hu&s;bands, I remain,</P>

<L>Preliminary Thoughts on peace.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><Q REND="inline">"WAR, &s;aith Vincent Wing in his almanack, begets poverty, poverty peace."</Q> Now as &s;ome, at lea&s;t, of the parties engaged in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, &s;eem to be nearly whirled round to that part of the circle of events, de&s;cribed by the learned Philomath in the lines above-mentioned, all con&s;iderate per&s;ons begin to look forward to the con&s;equences of &s;uch a revolution. The &s;agacious gentlemen at the Smyrna have already deliberated what part of our conque&s;ts we &s;hall &s;orego, and what we &s;hall retain. It was but the other day, that I &s;aw a political junto in a corner of the room, with a map of America lying before them, and heard their final re&s;olution not to re&s;tore an acre of Canada; though they were a little
<PB N="44" REF="68">
di&s;concerted by a &s;ugar-merchant from the city, who happened to drop in at the time, and declared with an oath, that the nation was undone, if we agreed to give up Guadalupe. The dealers in the &s;tocks at Garraway's and Jonathan's are locking up all their ready money in the funds, and calculating at how much <HI>per cent.</HI> advance they &s;hall be able to &s;ell out on the proclamation of peace; and, in the mean time, &s;ome of the gentlemen at Arthur's, with many other per&s;ons at both ends of the town, are attentively con&s;idering the con&s;equences of a peace in dimini&s;hing or increa&s;ing the emoluments of their &s;everal places, employments, or profe&s;&s;ions. A friend of mine, a very hone&s;t gentleman, who is an agent in the city, told me la&s;t week, that, if he was but &s;o happy as to &s;ee the war continue for <HI>only</HI> four years more, he &s;hould make an e&s;tate, and ride in his coach and &s;ix: and it was but the next day that another intimate acquaintance, who has an employment in the war-office, declared to me, that he &s;hould lay down his chariot immediately upon a peace. For my own part, none of the va|rious con&s;iderations, ju&s;t enumerated, take hold on me. I have, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, no money in the funds, and no employment under the government; and, as to politicks, &s;ince the&s;e are not times
<PB N="45" REF="69">
when author-incendiaries are hired to take up the bellows to kindle the embers of &s;edition, or paid for laying them down again, what has a GENIUS to do with &s;uch con&s;iderations on the war or the peace? Libels, publick or private, are, alas! attended only with fines, impri&s;onment, and the pillory. Waving, therefore, all other reflections, I &s;hall con&s;ider this important event, come when it may, as a mere morali&s;t; and endeavour to trace out the mo&s;t probable effects of a peace, on the manners and principles of the good people of Great Britain.</P>
<P>I think, I may venture to progno&s;ticate, that its fir&s;t vi&s;ible effects will be manife&s;t in our dre&s;s, &s;o that every lady and gentleman may be &s;aid to carry about them a kind of badge of peace and reconci|liation, by adopting that foreign air, of which we are &s;o great admirers. I have no apprehen&s;ion that our home manufactures will &s;tand &s;till, and that the indu&s;trious arti&s;ts of Spital-fields, whom publick &s;pirit has of late &s;o much encouraged, will be left to &s;tarve for want of due employment; but I think I fore&s;ee a whole pacquet of tailors, hair-cutters, and milliners, coming over in every ve&s;&s;el, and new patterns for caps and handkerchiefs, with the true Paris cut for cloaths, &s;ent by every mail. There
<PB N="46" REF="70">
&s;eems to have been much decency and cha&s;te re&s;erve in the habit of both &s;exes during the war; but, as we are allowed to be a very imitative, though not an inventive nation, I have &s;ome dread of the new fa&s;hions to be introduced after the peace. Then, perhaps, we may again &s;ee, among the ladies, uncovered &s;houlders, naked brea&s;ts, and legs revealed above the ancle; and among the men, &s;hort jerkins, white hats, and red-heeled &s;hoes. In order to prevent the&s;e and other irregularities, I would humbly propo&s;e that, before the treaty is concluded, a congre&s;s of dre&s;&s;ers, fri&s;eurs, and tyrewomen, plenipotentiary, be appointed to meet in &s;ome neutral country; and that, in the mean time, wooden dolls, dre&s;&s;ed, <HI>a la mode de Pa&iuml;s,</HI> be reciprocally &s;ent over between the cities of London and Paris, the better to adju&s;t the preliminaries.</P>
<P>The large cargoes of tailors, &amp;c. which the peace will waft over, will, however, be very ina|dequate to the number of Engli&s;h gentlemen, and <HI>Milors Angloi&s;es,</HI> that will immediately &s;et &s;ail for France, not for the &s;ake of intere&s;t, but di&s;&s;ipa|tion. A bridge from Dover to Calais would per|haps hardly render the emigrations of our people more frequent. Paris will then be con&s;idered as an addition to the number of our places of publick
<PB N="47" REF="71">
re&s;ort, and vi&s;ited with as much readine&s;s as Tun|bridge, Bath, or Scarborough. This is a field which affords &s;o much room for ob&s;ervation, that perhaps I may think it worth while to collect my materials on the &s;pot, and may date &s;ome of my future papers from a Hotel at Paris. In the mean time, as our mini&s;try and parliament will un|doubtedly turn their thoughts towards the reduc|tion of the national debt, nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;ed by an expen&s;ive, though glorious war, my &s;kill in politicks cannot &s;ugge&s;t a better mea&s;ure or more equitable tax to their con&s;ideration, than an heavy duty on the exportation of fools.</P>
<P>The ladies, who have ju&s;tly complained of the dearth of men during the war, will, I dare &s;ay, concur with me in the propriety of this new tax, and to oblige them I would propo&s;e that all importations of volunteers from abroad, and other recruits, may be permitted duty-free. At the &s;ame time I cannot but congratulate my fair countrywomen on the great plenty of males, which the peace mu&s;t produce. We &s;hall no longer &s;ee a row of di&s;con&s;o|late females, &s;itting, like &s;uperannuated maidens, un&s;ollicited at a ball, or a lady of fa&s;hion reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>figuring in</HI> with the butler. The officers of di&s;banded regiments will be glad to
<PB N="48" REF="72">
&s;upply the deficiencies of half pay by the acce&s;&s;ion of a large portion with a wife; and the brave gentlemen of the militia, no longer embodied or traver&s;ing the country to di&s;tant encampments, will add to the publick meetings and a&s;&s;emblies of their own counties the brilliancy of a red coat and cockade, without the terror that &s;uch a dre&s;s com|monly brings with it, and as much harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s as a &s;word in the &s;cabbard. The&s;e new-commi&s;|&s;ioned &s;oldiers may rejoice at the thought of having wiped off the contempt, that once cleaved to the name of MILITIA, and the ladies may be happy to take an hero to their arms, who can fight for his country, without being &s;ent out of it. In a word, this is one of the mo&s;t jocund ideas, that peace affords. Bath, Bri&s;tol, Margate, Brighthelm&s;tone, &amp;c. will again become the &s;cenes of plea&s;ure and delight; and the gallant warriors, who have de|&s;erved &s;o well of Mars, now devoted to Venus in her turn, have nothing to do but to recommend them&s;elves to the favour of the fair &s;ex, and en|deavour to repair the ravages of war by determining, with captain Plume, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>To rai&s;e recruits the matrimo|nial way.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>But the joy, which the gaiety of the&s;e contem|plations in&s;pires, is much allayed by con&s;idering
<PB N="49" REF="73">
the unhappy &s;ituation of the daily, weekly, morning, and evening retailers of news. During the time of war, a battle in Germany, a fort &s;tormed in the We&s;t-Indies, or a Nabob created in the Ea&s;t, is worth forty &s;hillings to every paper, that reprints the particulars from the Gazette Extraordinary: nay a town taken or a town lo&s;t is equally to the advantage of the&s;e half-&s;heet hi&s;torians; and the perpetual curio&s;ity kept alive by the publick anxiety, &s;ells off whole quires of unintere&s;ting details of births, deaths, marriages, and bankruptcies. How great then mu&s;t be the dread of the con&s;e|quences of peace to the proprietors of the &s;warm of Adverti&s;ers, Gazetteers, Ledgers, Journals, Chro|nicles, and Evening Po&s;ts? A peace, which will lie heavier on their papers than the double duty on the &s;tamps! My good friend Mr. H. BALDWIN of White Friars has already expre&s;t to me his fears on this occa&s;ion. He fairly tells me to my face, that though the GENIUS were to &s;tand in the front of his paper three times a week, the pub|lick attention would flag without great incidents and alarming paragraphs. He further acquaints me that, in order to recommend the St. James's Chronicle, he has engaged an ingenious gentleman, who, be&s;ides tran&s;lating the mails, touching up
<PB N="50" REF="74">
collectors' paragraphs, and writing occa&s;ional let|ters from the Hague, has al&s;o a &s;ufficient portion of invention and philo&s;ophy, (having fini&s;hed his education at St. John's college, Cambridge) to draw up accounts of earthquakes, meteors, and eruptions of Aetna and Ve&s;uvius. Notwith&s;tand|ing all this, he requires my further a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e, I prote&s;t, are matters with which I am very little acquainted; yet, I will &s;trive (to u&s;e the news-paper phra&s;e) to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h corre&s;pondences</HI> of another &s;ort. I will u&s;e my intere&s;t to oblige the publick, like Boccalini, with the fre&s;he&s;t advices from Parna&s;&s;us; or, if my intelligence from that quarter &s;hould fail, I hope at lea&s;t to be able, as well as &s;ome of my cotemporaries, to produce a dialogue from among the dead.</P>
<Q>Flectere &s;i nequeo &s;uperos, Acheronta movebo.</Q>
<P>The happie&s;t circum&s;tance which I can recollect in favour of the&s;e per&s;ons employed in the eternal continuation of modern hi&s;tory, is, that a peace gives con&s;equence and dignity to &s;everal events, which would be &s;unk and neglected during the tu|mult of a war. We all remember to have &s;een the whole nation, at &s;uch a period, &s;plit into parties concerning the po&s;&s;ibility of a &s;ervant girl's &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing for a month on a few cru&s;ts of bread and a
<PB N="51" REF="75">
pitcher of water, while the wits of the age drew their pens, and were ready to &s;pill their la&s;t drop of ink on each &s;ide of the que&s;tion. At &s;uch a period a rabbit-woman, or a fortune-teller, a quack, or a bottle conjurer, engages the attention and engro&s;&s;es the conver&s;ation of the whole town: and a quarrel between a dancer and his mi&s;tre&s;s, or a di&s;pute between a couple of opera-&s;ingers, is of as much importance as the di&s;&s;ention between two generals. The violence of the Briti&s;h &s;pirit of party will always create fuel for its own flame to feed upon: when it can no longer rage abroad, it will commit deva&s;tations at home; when it has no occa&s;ion to exert it&s;elf in vindication of liberty and property, it will vent it&s;elf on trifles; and the politicians of Britain, like the patriots of Lilliput, will divide concerning the height of &s;hoe-heels, or the manner of breaking of eggs.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e dome&s;tick con&s;iderations, there is one in particular, which pre&s;&s;es on my mind; but though I feel its force, I am quite at a lo&s;s to ex|pre&s;s my &s;en&s;ations: the idea is indeed too big and lofty, and &s;o far above the pitch of the&s;e mean e&s;&s;ays, that I &s;eem, like the poet of old, to receive an admonition from &s;ome &s;uperior, to have re|cour&s;e to more familiar &s;ubjects. I &s;hall, there|fore,
<PB N="52" REF="76">
leave to &s;ome greater matter the endeavour to give to po&s;terity the portrait of a KING, happy in the love and admiration of his &s;ubjects, proud of calling every Briton his fellow-countryman, and employed in cultivating THE ARTS of PEACE.</P>

<PB N="53" REF="77">
or the other &s;hould have tran&s;ported the GENIUS almo&s;t two hundred miles beyond the limits of the bills of mortality. I could oblige the reader with a curious detail of my journey and adventures: I could tell him, that my publi&s;her furni&s;hed me with one hor&s;e, and my printer with another, together with his devil in livery, for an attendant: but the&s;e and many other curious particulars mu&s;t be deferred to &s;ome future opportunity, that in the mean time I may have lei&s;ure to communi|cate &s;ome few ob&s;ervations made, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> on my fellow-&s;ubjects re&s;ident in the country.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the encomiums on a rural life, &s;own &s;o thick in the writings of poets and philo&s;ophers, we do not, in this degenerate age, think our&s;elves &s;ure to breathe the pure air of in|nocence and ancient &s;implicity, the minute we have got out of the &s;moke of London; we do not perceive a gradual declen&s;ion of vice at every mile-&s;tone, or di&s;cover morality upon every hay|cock. The clown who works at plough and cart, nay even the tender of &s;heep, for whom we have &s;o much re&s;pect in pa&s;toral and romance, excite our veneration little more than a linkboy or a hackney-coachman. The very milkmaid, with her pail on her head, engages our e&s;teem no more
<PB N="54" REF="78">
than her fellow-labourers, who carry the yoke, about our &s;treets: and &s;o little do we expect to find the manners of the golden age prevail among our ru&s;ticks, that we &s;ee, without remor&s;e or &s;ur|pri&s;e, &s;ome bumkin Phillis condemned to the gallows for the murder of her ba&s;tard child, or a refractory Damon committed to the hou&s;e of cor|rection, &s;et in the &s;tocks, or &s;ent abroad for a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>But though we have &s;urmounted the&s;e preju|dices, perhaps we &s;till retain &s;ome antiquated ideas of the manners of the country, &s;carce le&s;s re|mote from tho&s;e which at pre&s;ent reign there, than even the manners of Arcadia. We are apt to take it for granted, that there yet remains among them, a &s;trong leaven of that roughne&s;s and ru&s;ticity, which was &s;o long con&s;idered as their di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tick. It is &s;carce half a century ago, &s;ince the inhabitants of the di&s;tant counties were regarded as a &s;pecies, almo&s;t as dif|ferent from tho&s;e of the metropolis, as the na|tives of the Cape of Good Hope. Their man|ners, as well as dialect, were entirely provincial; and their dre&s;s no more re&s;embling the habit of the town, than the Turki&s;h or Chine&s;e. But time, which has inclo&s;ed commons, and ploughed up heaths, has likewi&s;e cultivated the minds, and
<PB N="55" REF="79">
improved the behaviour of the ladies and gentlemen of the country. We are no longer encountered with hearty &s;laps on the back, or pre&s;t to make a breakfa&s;t on cold meat and &s;trong beer; and in the cour&s;e of a tour of Great Britain, you will not meet with a high-crowned hat, or a pair of red &s;tockings. Politene&s;s and ta&s;te &s;eem to have driven away the horrid &s;pectres of rudene&s;s and barbarity, that haunted the old man&s;ion-hou&s;e and its purlieus, and to have e&s;tabli&s;hed their &s;eats in the country.</P>
<P>It is certainly to the intercour&s;e between the town and country, of late &s;o much more frequent, that this extraordinary change mu&s;t be imputed. Every traveller, that goes down to Cumberland or Cornwall, carries in &s;ome &s;ort the town along with him, and inevitably leaves &s;ome tincture of it behind him: and every vi&s;it, which an hone&s;t ru&s;tick pays to London, in&s;en&s;ibly files off &s;ome of the ru&s;t of the country. Formerly indeed, when <HI>that the roads were dark, and ways were mire,</HI> as Milton expre&s;&s;es it in one of his &s;onnets, a journey into the country was con&s;idered as almo&s;t as great an undertaking as a voyage to the In|dies. The old family coach was &s;ure to be &s;towed, according to Vanburgh's admirable de&s;cription of
<PB N="56" REF="80">
it, with all &s;orts of luggage and provi&s;ions; and perhaps in the cour&s;e of the journey, a whole vil|lage, together with their teams, were called in aid to dig the heavy vehicle out of the clay, and to drag it to the next place of wretched accom|modation, which the road afforded. Thus they travelled, like the caravan over the de&s;erts of Ara|bia, with every di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance of te|diou&s;ne&s;s and inconvenience. But now, the amendment of the roads, with the many other im|provements of travelling, have in a manner opened a new communication between the &s;everal parts of our i&s;land. The people venture forth, and find them&s;elves enabled to traver&s;e the country with ea&s;e and expedition. Stage-coaches, machines, flys, and po&s;t-chai&s;es are ready to tran&s;port pa&s;&s;en|gers to and fro between the metropolis and the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the kingdom. The lover now can almo&s;t literally <HI>annihilate time and &s;pace,</HI> and be with his mi&s;tre&s;s, before &s;he dreams of his arrival. Even a troop of gee&s;e and turkies may be driven from the country to town in a &s;horter time, than a nobleman and his family could have taken the journey heretofore, and the game|&s;ter offers to bet, that he can go from London to Edinburgh in twelve hours. In &s;hort, the manners,
<PB N="57" REF="81">
fa&s;hions, amu&s;ements, vices, and follies of the me|tropolis, now make their way to the remote&s;t corners of the land, as readily and &s;peedily along the turn|pike road, as, of old, Milton's SIN and DEATH, by means of their marvellous bridge over the Chaos, from the infernal regions to our world.</P>
<P>The effects of this ea&s;y communication, have almo&s;t daily grown more and more vi&s;ible. The &s;everal great cities, and we might add many poor country towns, &s;eem to be univer&s;ally in&s;pired with an ambition of becoming the little Londons of the part of the kingdom wherein they are &s;ituated: the notions of &s;plendor, luxury, and amu&s;ement, that prevail in town, are eagerly adopted; the various changes of the fa&s;hion ex|actly copied; and the whole manner of life &s;tudi|ou&s;ly imitated. The country ladies are as much devoted to the card-table, as the re&s;t of the &s;ex in London; and being equally tired of making puddings and tarts, or working &s;creens and car|pets, they too have their routes, and croud as many of their neighbours as they can get together, into their apartments: they too, have their balls and concerts by &s;ub&s;cription; their theatres, their mall, and &s;ometimes their rural Ranelagh, or Vauxhall. The reading female hires her novels
<PB N="58" REF="82">
from &s;ome country circulating library, which con&s;i&s;ts of about an hundred volumes, or, is trundled from the next market town in a wheelbarrow; and the merchant, or opulent hardware-man, has his villa three or four miles di&s;tant from the great town where he carries on his bu&s;ine&s;s. The nobleman and country &s;quire, no longer affect an old-fa&s;hioned ho&s;pitality, or &s;uffer the locu&s;ts of the country to eat them up, while they keep open hou&s;e, and di&s;pen&s;e victuals and horns of beer, like the anci|ent convents, to all comers; but more fa&s;hion|ably di&s;play the elegance of their ta&s;te, by making genteel entertainments: the &s;ame French cooks are employed, the &s;ame wines are drank, the &s;ame gaming practi&s;ed, the &s;ame hours kept, and the &s;ame cour&s;e of life pur&s;ued in the country as in town. The force of this illu&s;trious example in|fluences the whole country; and every male and female wi&s;hes to think and &s;peak, to eat and drink, and dre&s;s, and live, after the manner of people of quality in London.</P>
<P>There is no popular &s;ubject of &s;atire, on which the modern common places of wit and ridicule have been exhau&s;ted with more &s;ucce&s;s, than on that of a mere cockney affecting the plea&s;ures of the country. The du&s;ty hou&s;e clo&s;e to the road &s;ide,
<PB N="59" REF="83">
the half-acre of garden, the canal no bigger than a wa&s;h-hand ba&s;on, &amp;c. have all been marked out with much humour and ju&s;tice; but after all, it is not unnatural for a trade&s;man, who is continu|ally pent up in the clo&s;e &s;treets and alleys of a po|pulous city, to wi&s;h for fre&s;h air, or to attempt to indulge a lei&s;ure hour in &s;ome rural occupation; and he who prevails on him&s;elf to give up the en|joyments which nature has thrown into our laps in the country, for a poor imitation of the follies of the town, is infinitely more ridiculous. Ly|curgus pa&s;&s;ed a law in Sparta to prevent the impor|tation of foreign vanities, and not only expre&s;sly forbad the continuance of &s;trangers in the city, for fear of their corrupting the people, but for the &s;ame rea&s;ons would not permit his own people to travel. Frequent intercour&s;e will undoubtedly pro|duce &s;imilarity of manners; but the pre&s;ent com|munication between the various quarters of our i&s;lands, are &s;o far from being to be lamented, that it is only to be wi&s;hed and recommended, that they may produce real refinements and improvements of a valuable nature. At the &s;ame time let it be con&s;idered by our country gentlemen and la|dies that no benefit can ari&s;e from changing one &s;et of follies for another; and that the vices of the town never appear &s;o truly ridiculous, or &s;o
<PB N="60" REF="84">
thoroughly contemptible, as when they are auk|wardly practi&s;ed in the country.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SLANDER is an elegant and refined art, which has been brought to &s;uch a wonderful perfec|tion, that it is not only univer&s;ally practi&s;ed and thoroughly under&s;tood, but is become the &s;oul of polite conver&s;ation, and one of the mo&s;t agree|able amu&s;ements of private life. Formerly, an infant lye, fearful of detection, and almo&s;t a&s;hamed to &s;hew it&s;elf in publick, made its way but &s;lowly in the world; but now, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;e|hood comes abroad with the utmo&s;t confidence, and peremptorily challenges our notice and atten|tion. Not content with a general a&s;&s;ertion of
<PB N="61" REF="85">
any fact, it delights to be minute and circum&s;tan|tial; enters into particulars, tells you the man|ner how, the time when, the place where, and gives the names of all the parties concerned. Such a report having gone round to every coffee-hou&s;e, and got into every private family, having been uni|ver&s;ally told, and almo&s;t as univer&s;ally credited, comes at la&s;t to the ears of the per&s;ons, who have been the uncon&s;cious &s;ubjects of it. Then the whole &s;tory proves entirely groundle&s;s; but they, who&s;e reputation has been thus &s;ported with, have no remedy except the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own integrity, unle&s;s they chu&s;e to make a genteel retaliation on their next neighbour, or to encoun|ter with the air. It might be deemed too &s;evere an act of cen&s;orial authority, to di&s;countenance &s;o polite an entertainment, and might, perhaps, put &s;ome of the be&s;t company to &s;ilence. Yet, &s;ince it is but of late that &s;lander has, at its very birth, come forth (like Pallas from the head of Jupiter) armed at all points, hedged round with circum&s;tance, and lackered over with probability, it may not be incurious to enquire, who are the&s;e active mini&s;ters of fal&s;hood, that &s;et it &s;o firmly on its legs, and bring it &s;o early to maturity: I &s;hall therefore dedicate the pre&s;ent paper to the
<PB N="62" REF="86">
de&s;cription of two of the&s;e ingenious characters, each of which rough draughts, the reader, who is at all conver&s;ant with the world, will, I am &s;ure, be able to apply to more than one original.</P>
<P>LADY JACYNTHA SCANDAL is a woman of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion, and her hou&s;e is the daily re&s;ort of the fir&s;t company. Her reputation, it is true, is not quite un&s;tained; but the blemi&s;hes of her character, like the &s;pots in the &s;un, are overcome by the &s;plendor of her quality. By the force of a genteel malice and plea&s;ant ill-nature, together with an happy a&s;&s;urance that enables her to throw off the re&s;erve of her &s;ex, &s;he is univer&s;ally ac|knowledged to be a wit. The &s;martne&s;s of her re|partees be&s;peaks uncommon vivacity, and her ex|qui&s;ite turn for the <HI>double Entendre</HI> denotes an ad|mirable pruriency of imagination. She will tell a &s;tory to a room full of mixt company, almo&s;t rich enough in its circum&s;tances for the high-wrought memoirs of a woman of plea&s;ure, with|out u&s;ing one indelicate expre&s;&s;ion, without offend|ing the cha&s;te&s;t ear, or betraying the lea&s;t con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that &s;he is all the while on the very brink of indecorum. She receives all her vi&s;itors with the mo&s;t perfect good breeding; but the in|&s;tant that any one of them departs, he becomes
<PB N="63" REF="87">
the &s;ubject of her plea&s;antry and ridicule to tho&s;e that &s;tay behind. She cannot rai&s;e our idea of her own character, but &s;he can le&s;&s;en our opinion of another's. In a word, her lady&s;hip is the fear and delight, the envy and &s;corn, the honey and gall, of the great world: nobody thinks well of her, but nobody &s;peaks ill of her, and every body vi&s;its her.</P>
<P>Neither love, nor honours, nor riches, nor any other worldly plea&s;ure, can give half &s;o much de|light to LADY JACYNTHA SCANDAL, as the gratification of her dear pa&s;&s;ion for mi&s;chief: and there are likewi&s;e certain other female geniu&s;&s;es, who love a little witty malice better than their prayers. Several of the&s;e are frequently a&s;&s;embled at LADY JACYNTHA's, and it is to the ingenuity of this petticoat junto that the &s;trange reports, which alarm the whole town, are often owing. They are not contented with the more than u&s;ual poig|nancy of their chit-chat over the tea-table, but &s;et them&s;elves to invent important &s;landers, and to devi&s;e the &s;ure&s;t means to give them colour. If &s;ome pale-faced London coquette, &s;ome hagged member of the cabal, worn to the bone with paint and late hours, is offended with the ruddy bloom of &s;ome new toa&s;t from the country, it is here
<PB N="64" REF="88">
that &s;he meditates revenge, and it is &s;uddenly proclaimed, or, as the phra&s;e is, <HI>reported,</HI> that the innocent young lady has been detected in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t familiarities with one of her father's foot|men; or if a dutche&s;s has piqued &s;ome of the junto, by excluding them from her route, or leaving them uninvited to a ball, her rank will &s;o little avail to exempt her from the like treatment, that the &s;lander will rather be aggravated in pro|portion to the dignity of its object.</P>
<P>Never did &s;tate&s;man &s;tudy more attentively the art of political lying, or &s;tockjobber u&s;e more &s;tra|tagems to rai&s;e or &s;ink the value of the funds, than are u&s;ed by the ingenious junto, to &s;end forth an injurious report with &s;ecrecy. Nobody knows on what authority the &s;tory is founded which every body repeats; and it is as impo&s;&s;ible to trace the &s;lander up to its &s;ource, as to di&s;|cover the head of the Nile. I have ob&s;erved, indeed, that it commonly takes its ri&s;e in the mo&s;t di&s;|tant quarter, from that where the parties re&s;ide whom it is intended to affect. When a per&s;on of high rank is de&s;tined for the victim, an emi&s;&s;ary is di&s;patched to &s;et the &s;tory abroach at &s;ome ob|&s;cure coffee-hou&s;e in the city, whence it &s;peedily marches to its head quarters near the court: or,
<PB N="65" REF="89">
if perhaps &s;ome rich banker and his family are to be made a &s;acrifice, it is whi&s;pered about the politer part of the town, that a certain great hou&s;e near the Royal Exchange has &s;topt payment. Some|times the curious tale &s;eems to have travelled out of the country, and &s;ometimes, like the great fire of London, it breaks out in &s;everal quarters of the town at once. However, come whence it may, true or fal&s;e, probable or improbable, down it goes; and the dear, witty, &s;weet, mi&s;chievous crea|tures, who invented it, practi&s;e ten thou&s;and additional little arts to give it credit. <Q REND="inline">"They do not believe, indeed, that the thing happened, ju&s;t as it is related; but then there <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be <HI>&s;ome|thing</HI> in it, &s;ay what they will, or el&s;e how could there be &s;uch a number of <HI>particulars?</HI> They have heard too, (good &s;ouls!) nay, they <HI>know,</HI> that the parties them&s;elves are very unea&s;y at the &s;tory, and have taken a great deal of pains to di&s;credit it, which looks very &s;u&s;picious; for why &s;hould they be &s;o concerned, if, (<HI>in part</HI> at lea&s;t) it were not true, or &s;uffer their peace to be broken by a mere idle report?"</Q> With &s;uch candour and humanity do LADY JACYNTHA, and the re&s;t of the&s;e good &s;ort of people expre&s;s their &s;entiments; and at the &s;ame
<PB N="66" REF="90">
time many of the mo&s;t intimate friends of the per|&s;ons reviled repeat the &s;lander, or at lea&s;t make no efforts to contradict it: yet where is the offence or injury? it was not their invention, you know, and they only joined in the common <HI>talk of the town.</HI></P>
<P>Lord Bacon &s;omewhere remarks that great inqui|&s;itivene&s;s and curio&s;ity concerning the affairs of others, is one of the chief characteri&s;ticks of envy. It would be unpardonable to attribute &s;o black a pa&s;&s;ion to a fine lady; and yet it is certain, that no mortal was ever more &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that inquiring &s;pirit than LADY JACYNTHA SCANDAL. She will hold long conferences, for the &s;ake of intelligence, with her mantua-maker or milliner, and has an admirable knack at draw|ing the &s;ecrets of families from &s;ervants and chil|dren. By the&s;e, and the like means, &s;he is ac|quainted with the private bu&s;ine&s;s and private plea|&s;ures of the whole town. Nobody knows &s;o well as her lady&s;hip, what lady's diamonds are in pawn, what duke's e&s;tate was lately mortgaged, what lord's &s;i&s;ter's fortunes are not paid off, what poet keeps a mi&s;tre&s;s, what young man and woman are clande&s;tinely married, or what grave judge has been caught, in a frolick&s;ome vein, at
<PB N="67" REF="91">
a game of romps with his cook-maid. Such are the anecdotes which &s;he is eager to learn; and her a&s;&s;iduity in collecting them is only to be equalled by her indu&s;try in making them publick.</P>
<P>Equally attached to &s;lander, but of the other &s;ex, and of a lower rank, is the pert, volatile, prating, &s;cribbling, JACKY TATTLE. JACKY is the &s;on of an attorney of Furnival's-Inn, and was originally intended for his father's profe&s;&s;ion; but the &s;trength of his Genius &s;oon drew him from the de&s;k, and carried him among&s;t under-actors, un|der-authors, and women of the town: in which company he &s;oon converted his pertne&s;s into a&s;&s;u|rance, and wonderfully improved his natural ta|lents for lying and defamation. Slander may, indeed, be &s;aid to be his pa&s;&s;ion, and to &s;pread it his daily employment; and as birds are ob&s;erved to peck the fine&s;t fruit, &s;o this fluttering tom-tit always aims his petulant attacks at the faire&s;t cha|racters. The company with which he a&s;&s;ociates, naturally deal in detraction, his folly induces him to give credit to the &s;lander, and his vanity often urges him publickly to interfere in it. He is al&s;o a great writer of anonymous epi&s;tles from unknown friends, as well as incendiary letters from &s;ecret enemies. He &s;ometimes amu&s;es him&s;elf
<PB N="68" REF="92">
with &s;ending letters and paragraphs to the news|papers, in which he &s;ometimes appears as a &s;ix-lined epigrammati&s;t, and is confidently &s;aid to be the author of &s;everal articles in The New Review. If ever you ob&s;erve an imper|tinent fellow, in the next box at a coffee|hou&s;e, li&s;tening to your private conver&s;ation with a friend, or ca&s;ting his eye over a letter, which you are reading or writing, that is JACKY TATTLE.&mdash;Or if you &s;ee a &s;trange town-fly fluttering at the play-hou&s;e, &s;taring every body out of countenance, and buzzing about the theatre, now in the orche&s;tra, now in the green-boxes, and by-and-by behind the &s;cenes, that is JACKY TATTLE.&mdash;Poor JACKY's courage is unhappily not quite adequate to his malignity, &s;o that his indi&s;cretions have &s;ometimes betrayed him into puni&s;hment for his &s;landers; yet his appetite for detraction mu&s;t be gratified; he con&s;iders him&s;elf as a formidable adver&s;ary to &s;everal characters of merit, and is thoroughly per&s;uaded that the ladies all believe him to be a wit and a fine gentleman.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the rigour of &s;ome criticks, which would entirely preclude the choice of temporary &s;ubjects, there are no parts of periodical publications, which have been more favourably received at their fir&s;t appearance, or afforded more entertainment afterwards, than &s;uch as were founded on matters merely fugi|tive, and peculiar to the time in which they were written. Such pieces become a kind of &s;upplement to hi&s;tory: they furni&s;h the curious with anec|dotes; and it is from the&s;e materials, that the lite|rary virtuo&s;o collects the manners, fa&s;hions, and
<PB N="70" REF="94">
cu&s;toms of his ance&s;tors. The Tatlers and Spec|tators, for in&s;tance, &s;erve almo&s;t as effectually as a gallery of pictures, to &s;hew the habits in vogue at that period; and are, at the &s;ame time, a kind of hi&s;torical regi&s;ter of the prevailing plea|&s;ures, and the objects of publick attention. In the peru&s;al of the&s;e papers we &s;eem to be endued, like Janus, with a &s;ort of backward face that enables us to take a clear, retro&s;pective view of times pa&s;t. We &s;pend evenings at the clubs of our fathers, &s;ome of whom may perhaps have been Mohocks, and gain admittance to the toilets of our mothers and grandmothers. We read, not without &s;atisfaction, comments on the performances of actors, whom we never &s;aw: we look upon the celebrated trunk-maker with a veneration equal to that of his cotemporaries; and are hugely entertained at Powell's puppet-&s;hew.</P>
<P>It is to be con&s;idered, that periodical writers conver&s;e more familiarly with the publick than any other authors; they are allowed, nay ex|pected, to chat of them&s;elves, the play, the opera, and are even in danger of being neglected, if they omit to di&s;cour&s;e on the popular topicks of conver&s;ation. Our good advice (for we are all &s;agacious monitors of the publick) mu&s;t not be
<PB N="71" REF="95">
obtruded on our readers, but mu&s;t &s;eem to be u&s;hered in by the occa&s;ion, and to take its colour from the times. The pre&s;ent complection of the people is &s;uch, that I find it ab&s;olutely vain and ridi|culous to attempt writing to them on any other &s;ubject than that of the Royal Wedding and Coronation. My printer too has mo&s;t earne&s;tly re|que&s;ted me to give what he calls <HI>a touch on the times,</HI> and to &s;ay &s;omething on the&s;e great occa&s;ions. He tells me, that there is &s;carce one of his cu&s;|tomers, who would not &s;ooner give a guinea for a night's lodging on the floor at Greenwich, or five for the &s;ake of &s;itting eight and forty hours in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abby, than part with two-pence half|penny for <HI>the</HI> GENIUS, unle&s;s it treats of tho&s;e &s;olemnities. Scarce a paragraph of news, relat|ing to any other matters, will go down. The proceedings of the Court of Claims, the ladies coronation robes, and the aldermens' coronation wigs, furni&s;h out the mo&s;t intere&s;ting articles of intelligence. The ma&s;ter of an ale-hou&s;e in the next lane to my apartments has hung out a pa|per lanthorn to adverti&s;e the neighbourhood, that he &s;ells the be&s;t Mecklenburg purl and Coronation porter. The theatres are, I doubt not, both employed in the preparation of entertainments
<PB N="72" REF="96">
&s;uitable to the &s;plendor and joy of the&s;e happy cele|brities; and a famous field-preacher has, to my knowledge, already anticipated the Archbi&s;hop in a Coronation Sermon.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o lately been honoured with a pacquet of letters from &s;everal corre&s;pondents, not one of which but relates to the&s;e two grand occa&s;ions of fe&s;tivity. Many, I find, are &s;ollicitous to know what will become of <HI>the</HI> GENIUS, and into what corner he will &s;queeze his little body at the corona|tion. A gentleman, who &s;igns him&s;elf Timothy Cautious, tells me, that in ca&s;e I have no ticket, I may ea&s;ily be conveyed into the hall undi&s;covered in &s;ome old counte&s;s's pocket, or be rolled up and over&s;hadowed by the full bottom of a noble|man's periwig. A lady gives her&s;elf the trouble to recapitulate the advantages and di&s;advantages of my per&s;on on this occa&s;ion; and informs me that, indeed, I may be put any where, but that unfor|tunately, I &s;hall be able to &s;ee no where. Ano|ther corre&s;pondent, who &s;ub&s;cribes him&s;elf COKE <HI>junior,</HI> and dates from the Inner Temple, &s;ays, that he hopes I have &s;ecured a place in We&s;tmin&s;ter|hall, and adds (but I do not know what he means by it) that he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee me appear there oftener than I u&s;ed to do. The two following
<PB N="73" REF="97">
letters are, I think, the mo&s;t proper of any I have received, to &s;ubmit to my reader at full length: to them therefore I &s;hall devote the re&s;t of this paper.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t comes from a lady, and is as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO THE GENIUS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have often lamented that I did not live in tho&s;e illu&s;trious ages of the world, when our &s;ex was allowed to di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf by acts of prowe&s;s and chivalry. I &s;hould have delighted to have traver&s;ed the de&s;arts, and to have re&s;cued innocent virgins in di&s;tre&s;s. The degeneracy of the pre&s;ent times has often been the cau&s;e of my &s;ore af|fliction; and there is no circum&s;tance from which I have ever in my life reaped &s;o much con&s;olation, as from the thoughts of the approaching Coro|nation, which &s;olemnity &s;till retains &s;ome leaven of the ancient manners of this kingdom; of which I can vouch no &s;tronger te&s;timony than the well-known ceremony of the CHAMPION in We&s;t|min&s;ter-hall. But there is, however, even in this &s;ome deficiency, which I am ready and willing to &s;upply. Since the King has graciou&s;ly thought fit

to adorn this high fe&s;tival with the pre&s;ence of a Queen, it is &s;urely a di&s;honour to her merits, and an indignity to the whole &s;ex, that one &s;hould be wanting to vindicate her beauty, when a cham|pion appears to a&s;&s;ert the rights of his maje&s;ty.

<P>AT this critical conjuncture I cannot think, or talk, or write, of any thing but the wind. I gape at every weather-cock, and if there are none in fight, am perpetually throwing up my hand|kerchief to &s;ee, if there be a fair wind for the pa&s;&s;age of Her Intended Maje&s;ty. I am a good deal of a valetudinarian, and would, in general, almo&s;t as &s;oon wi&s;h for a plague as an Ea&s;terly wind; but now I pray for it every hour in the day. In &s;hort, Sir, the&s;e thoughts have filled my brains &s;o long, and po&s;&s;e&s;t them&s;elves &s;o entirely of my imagination, that the wind has got up into my head, and is attended with all the &s;ymptoms of a poetical vertigo. Modern odes are, you mu&s;t al|allow, the mo&s;t flatulent of all compo&s;itions: you will not be &s;urpri&s;ed, therefore, that the We&s;t Wind, which impregnated Virgil's mares, &s;hould al&s;o make me teem with an ode, and here it is at your &s;ervice.</P>

<P>THE learned and honourable tru&s;tees of The Bri|ti&s;h Mu&s;eum, well knowing and duly con&s;ider|ing the great work in which I am engaged, and thoroughly weighing the infinite importance of it to the morals of the people of Great Britain, have graciou&s;ly re&s;olved to afford me every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power, and given orders to the proper offi|cers for my con&s;tant admi&s;&s;ion to the reading-room, with free leave to peru&s;e &s;uch old papers and &s;carce manu&s;cripts, as my curio&s;ity may lead me to look into. They have al&s;o further &s;hewn them&s;elves &s;o favourably inclined to me and my undertakings, that they have &s;et a-part a certain angle of the
<PB N="79" REF="103">
room for my particular u&s;e; wherein there is erected an elegant machine, curiou&s;ly contrived by Mr. Burnet, cabinet-maker in the Strand, and known by the name of <HI>the</HI> GENIUS's reading-de&s;k. This machine, in con&s;ideration of my diminutivene&s;s, is con&s;tructed &s;omewhat on the principles of that u&s;ed by Gulliver in Brobdignag, and has often enabled me to manage the mo&s;t unwieldy volumes with ea&s;e, as well as, by means of its &s;teps, to climb up to the top of the page of many a tall folio. The modern artificers of furniture have cultivate no ta&s;te in moveables with more &s;ucce&s;s, than that which they call <HI>the</HI> BOOK FASHION; which is an ingenious method of reducing tea-che&s;ts to the &s;hape and &s;emblance of octavos and duodecimos, as well as <HI>Bedes</HI> and other <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> uten&s;ils, of a larger &s;ize, to the figure of quartos and folios. The&s;e goods may be had, neatly gilt and lettered, at the warehou&s;e of any fa&s;hionable uphol&s;terer; but where could &s;uch a mode be followed with &s;uch &s;trict propriety as in the con&s;truction of the implements of Literature? On your fir&s;t entrance into the room, you would take <HI>the</HI> GENIUS's read|ing de&s;k for an irregular heap of books of different &s;izes, thrown carele&s;sly one upon another: and, as it is u&s;ual to pre&s;erve &s;ome analogy between the
<PB N="80" REF="104">
mock volumes and the moveable which takes their form, commonly appropriating Pope's Letters, the Spectators, &amp;c. to the tea-table, and <HI>wa&s;te paper</HI> hi&s;tories, &amp;c. to the <HI>clo&s;et</HI>; in like manner the arti&s;t has ingeniou&s;ly rai&s;ed the &s;teps of my de&s;k upon STATIUS, and SCALIGER, and UP-<HI>ton,</HI> and STEP-<HI>ney,</HI> and MOUNT-<HI>eny,</HI> &amp;c. with many other curious conceits of the like nature, not unworthy the genius of an uphol&s;terer. A waggi&s;h Cantab, who popt into the room the other day, after having examined the de&s;k with great attention, told me, that he &s;ound <HI>the</HI> GENIUS, like Bayes, had certain mechanical helps for wit, and chri&s;tened it (after the univer&s;ity &s;tile of punning) my <HI>Gradus ad Parna&s;&s;um.</HI></P>
<P>A few days ago, as I was &s;tudiou&s;ly employed at this de&s;k, and preparing to &s;ay a word or two to the publick, as it were, <HI>ex cathedr&acirc;,</HI> a &s;agacious friend of mine, belonging to the Mu&s;eum, (who is for ever peering with his pur-blind eyes into &s;ome curio&s;ity, or bru&s;hing with his learned no&s;e the du&s;t from &s;ome rare manu&s;cript) threw a bun|dle of papers before me. This choice pacquet appeared, upon examination, to have been formerly in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir Thomas More, our great chancellor, of worthy and facetious memory, to
<PB N="81" REF="105">
whom it was addre&s;&s;ed by Petrus Aegidius (or, as &s;ome tran&s;lators call him, Peter Giles) of Antwerp, the very per&s;on to whom the chancellor in&s;cribed his Hi&s;tory of UTOPIA. This manu&s;cript contains a full detail of the laws, manners, cu&s;toms, &amp;c. of the inhabitants of the i&s;land of ANEMOLIA, taken from memory by Petrus Aegidius, like Sir Thomas More's own narrative, from the relation of Ra|phael. This country, as well as &s;everal others mentioned in the&s;e papers, is, I find, taken notice of in the Utopia; and Sir Thomas, &s;peaking cur|&s;orily of the people, calls them <HI>&s;uperbi magis quam &s;apientes,</HI> a proud rather than a wi&s;e nation. My veneration for manu&s;cripts is not &s;o implicit as to think, with &s;ome antiquarians, that every old paper is worthy to be printed, which has not yet been in print: but as I look upon this to be of an extremely curious nature, I &s;hall put it to the pre&s;s with all convenient &s;peed; and my friend above|mentioned has, for the benefit of the illiterate, chearfully &s;ubmitted to the labour of a tran&s;lation. This valuable narrative is written originally, like the Utopia, in very elegant Latin; and the genuine papers, for the &s;atisfaction of the Vir|tuo&s;i, &s;hall lie, till the time of publication, at Mr. Becket's, book&s;eller, in the Strand. In the
<PB N="82" REF="106">
mean time, I have thought proper to amu&s;e my readers with the following extracts made here and there from different parts of this valuable work, and I believe that mo&s;t per&s;ons will readily concur with me, merely from this &s;pecimen, that ANEMO|LIA, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t extraordinary country un|der the &s;un.</P>

<P>THERE is no language in the world more &s;weet, more copious, and better adapted to expre&s;s the meaning of the &s;peaker, than that of the ANE|MOLIANS: and yet, what is very wonderful, the ANEMOLIANS them&s;elves never make u&s;e of it in conver&s;ation; but having di&s;carded their own native tongue, ju&s;t after it had arrived to its highe&s;t pitch of perfection, they have, by a kind of general infatuation, adopted the har&s;her dialect of their neighbours and natural enemies, the ACHO|RIANS. The children of the lowe&s;t artificers are early in&s;tructed in the Achorian language, and are much a&s;hamed, if they happen, by chance, to ex|pre&s;s them&s;elves in their mother-tongue. From this &s;trange national folly the ACHORIANS have
<PB N="83" REF="107">
a&s;&s;umed an air of great &s;uperiority, and affect to regard the ANEMOLIANS as little better than bar|barians. So very unaccountable, and yet &s;o deeply rooted, is this contempt for their native lan|guage, that during the &s;hort time I &s;ojourned among them, a grammar of its rudiments and principles was burnt by the common hang-man; and a very ingenious author was condemned to be &s;tarved to death for having compiled an Anemo|lian Dictionary.</P>
<P>Their pa&s;&s;ion for literature, &s;uch as it is, is &s;o violent, that the number of their publications is incredible. They have, indeed, among their an|cient authors, &s;everal excellent writers on almo&s;t every &s;ubject, but the&s;e, like their language, are grown ob&s;olete: for the ANEMOLIANS are &s;uch wonderful lovers of novelty, that they indulge a de&s;ire for literary tra&s;h, almo&s;t as intemperate and irregular as the longings of pregnant women, or rather like the fal&s;e appetite of green-&s;ickne&s;s girls for chalk, oatmeal, and unripe fruit. Several thou&s;and printed &s;heets of paper are publi&s;hed every morning, as many at noon, and as many more every evening; be&s;ides which, a va&s;t variety of thin volumes, containing certain &s;ippets of philo&s;ophy, morality, and the arts, make their appearance
<PB N="84" REF="108">
with every new moon. But mo&s;t of the&s;e hourly, daily, and monthly publications are calculated merely for the amu&s;ement of the hour in which they come forth, and grow immediately afterwards as dull, u&s;ele&s;s, and unentertaining, as a la&s;t year's almanack. Hence the&s;e publications are, in the phra&s;e of that country, very properly &s;tiled <HI>Periodical.</HI> The art of writing is, indeed, nearly fallen into utter contempt among them, and be|come a mean handicraft bu&s;ine&s;s, and wretched ma|nufacture. So venal a profe&s;&s;ion is exerci&s;ed by few or none of any reputation; whence it happens, that though their new books are almo&s;t innumera|ble, the number of their writers is exceedingly &s;mall, four or five per&s;ons being the &s;ole authors of every work in every &s;cience; in each of which they acquit them&s;elves with equal dexterity.</P>
<P>The ANEMOLIANS affect an uncommon love for natural freedom; but their aim in this, as in mo&s;t other particulars, appears to be mercenary, endeavouring to gain pecuniary advantages to them|&s;elves by converting their <HI>liberty</HI> into <HI>property.</HI> According to the&s;e principles, the common inha|bitants of every town and di&s;trict within the kingdom &s;et them&s;elves to publick &s;ale by auction, once in &s;even years: two or three, and &s;ometimes
<PB N="85" REF="109">
four or five, or &s;ix or &s;even, of &s;uperior rank, appear as purcha&s;ers at the &s;ame place, on which occa&s;ions the highe&s;t bidder is the buyer. By the&s;e means the venal commonalty often extort large &s;ums, being paid for, like cattle, at &s;o much <HI>per</HI> head, and yet they have frequent cau&s;e to repent of their bargain; though it is but common ju&s;tice to add, that the purcha&s;ers al&s;o frequently pay more for them than they are worth.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE GENIUS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I inform you, that I am ju&s;t rai&s;ed from the humble condition of plain Mrs. Greenfield to the honour of being the lady of a member of parliament; when I tell you, that my hu&s;band was, at the la&s;t general election, cho&s;en by a great majority of voters for one of the mo&s;t eminent county-towns in the kingdom; when I further add, on good authority, that the petition intended to have been preferred again&s;t him is withdrawn, and that he &s;eems likely to &s;it out his &s;even years in the honourable Hou&s;e of Commons; when I &s;end you, Sir, all this &s;eeming good news, it only &s;erves to acquaint you, in other words, that I am one of the mo&s;t unhappy women upon earth; that my hu&s;band is an undone man, and that my dear children, though born to &s;ome e&s;tate, are in danger of being thrown upon the wide world to earn their uncertain bread.</P>
<P>But that which adds the greater acutene&s;s to my mi&s;ery, is the &s;ad and &s;udden revolution of our for|tune; for we are not only hurried to certain de|&s;truction, but drawn from a &s;tate of the mo&s;t perfect
<PB N="88" REF="112">
tranquillity. I have now been married almo&s;t fourteen years. My hu&s;band always behaved to me with the true&s;t tenderne&s;s and affection; the whole &s;tudy of my life has been to promote his hap|pine&s;s; and our little family has, all that while, lived comfortably in a cheap country upon a very moderate fortune. But, alas! the late general election has entirely rever&s;ed our &s;ituation. You mu&s;t know, Sir, that our county, like many others, is unhappily &s;plit into little parties and &s;actions, and a perpetual conte&s;t is kept alive by the two mo&s;t opulent per&s;ons in it, which of them &s;hall have the credit with the great folks <HI>above,</HI> as the phra&s;e is, of managing the re&s;t. A noble peer in our neighbourhood, who is the per&s;on that car|ries on this important di&s;pute with a wealthy baronet, did us the honour of a vi&s;it about a year ago, earne&s;tly intreating my hu&s;band to appear with another gentleman, in his lord&s;hip's intere&s;t, as a joint candidate for the county-town, in oppo&s;ition to two others &s;upported by the baronet. My hu&s;|band's vanity and ambition took the alarm in an in&s;tant, and he was all on fire for the honour of repre&s;enting &s;o re&s;pectable a place in parliament. Only two &s;mall objections pre&s;ented them&s;elves: the fir&s;t was, that his property lying chiefly in the
<PB N="89" REF="113">
funds, his landed e&s;tate did not quite amount to the yearly value, which, it &s;eems, is required as a nece&s;&s;ary qualification: and the &s;econd was, that his property, taken all together, would by no means enable him to defray the numerous and heavy expences of a conte&s;ted election. Both the&s;e objections were, however, without much difficulty, &s;urmounted. My hu&s;band had, indeed, at fir&s;t, &s;ome &s;cruples of con&s;cience on the fir&s;t article, as neither he nor I could think it po&s;&s;ible for him to take the oath of qualification with his &s;eat, without the requi&s;ite addition to his e&s;tate. An eminent lawyer, fetched from the inns of court in London on purpo&s;e, &s;oon &s;olved this difficulty, and made out a qualification in form, by means of an <HI>hocus|pocus</HI> conveyance from my lord to my hu&s;band, by which, they tell me, that my hu&s;band has en|larged his e&s;tate, though I know too well that he has not added to his income. As to the &s;econd objection, that was immediately got over by his lord&s;hip's declaration, that he meant to defray the whole expence of the election him&s;elf. My hu&s;band therefore chearfully pre&s;ented him&s;elf as a candidate; but I mu&s;t not forget to mention, that though he was brought in by the noble lord, as the whole country will tell you, <HI>for nothing,</HI> it
<PB N="90" REF="114">
co&s;t us very near a thou&s;and pounds. There were &s;everal unfore&s;een incident expences, created chiefly by the zeal of my hu&s;band's <HI>be&s;t friends,</HI> and tho&s;e who were mo&s;t warm in his intere&s;t; of which ex|pences, as he &s;eemed to be the immediate cau&s;e, though incurred without his direction, he was a&s;hamed to carry in the bills to his lord&s;hip at the clo&s;e of the conte&s;t, which had co&s;t the parties, both together, above thirty times that &s;um.</P>
<P>But this lo&s;s, as it was the fir&s;t, &s;o it would have been the lea&s;t, and mo&s;t ea&s;ily to be put up with, if my hu&s;band had been &s;o fortunate as to have lo&s;t his election. I mu&s;t repeat to you, Sir, that he was cho&s;en by an indi&s;putable majority; and I repeat it to you, not without &s;orrow; as I now too late di&s;cover the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature, in demanding &s;uch a qualification in property, &s;ince I &s;ee that a large e&s;tate is nece&s;&s;ary to keep up the con&s;equence even of a dependent member, as well as to &s;upport the real dignity of independence. The change in my hu&s;band's &s;ituation is much le&s;s extraordinary than the alteration in his ideas. He is no longer contented with being a plain country gentleman, as heretofore, but con&s;iders him&s;elf as a kind of publick character. Our hou&s;e is now thrown open to all comers and goers, and all the
<PB N="91" REF="115">
hone&s;t freemen mu&s;t be indulged with the run of our cellar and kitchen. We have treated the wor|&s;hipful corporation more than once, and every private gentleman mu&s;t be loaded with civilities in proportion to his influence and intere&s;t. My hu&s;band was formerly of &s;ome u&s;e to the country, merely by acting in the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace; but he has now, on the death of his lord&s;hip's brother, been appointed colonel of our militia; at our la&s;t a&s;&s;izes, he was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en to be foreman of the Grand Jury; and now that his pre|&s;ence is become of &s;o much con&s;equence in the county, I know that he will think it indi&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite for him always to fill the chair at the Se&s;&s;ions. The&s;e, and &s;everal other county-dig|nities, with which I plainly fore&s;ee he will be ho|noured, will not be maintained without extraor|dinary expences, be&s;ides tho&s;e which mu&s;t inevi|tably attend the nece&s;&s;ary journies between town and country.</P>
<P>From my mention of Journies, you will imme|diately conclude that we have an hou&s;e in town. To take one was, indeed, the fir&s;t re&s;olution which my hu&s;band made after his election; and that we are already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very hand&s;ome hou&s;e in one of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable parts of
<PB N="92" REF="116">
the town, is no incon&s;iderable circum&s;tance of my unhappine&s;s. We came to London time enough, you may be &s;ure, to attend the Coronation; and &s;everal of the electors being drawn up to town by the &s;ame great occa&s;ion, my hu&s;band hired a room, at the price of an hundred guineas, for our own and their accommodation to &s;ee the proce&s;&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">"The&s;e little acts of kindne&s;s, my dear, (&s;ays he to me) done for a &s;mall expence at a time when they appear di&s;intere&s;ted, go as far as twenty-fold that &s;um in &s;ea&s;ons of commotion and di&s;tre&s;s."</Q> Indeed nothing &s;eems to terrify him &s;o much as the apprehen&s;ions of being thought niggardly in his notions, and narrow in his oeconomy. He has of late frequently reprehended me for the plainne&s;s of my dre&s;s, and tells me, that the lady of a mem|ber of parliament, e&s;pecially the repre&s;entative of a place of &s;o much con&s;equence, ought to make a genteel appearance. I am in great fear of his pre&s;enting me with &s;ome jewels. He has already provided a &s;plendid equipage, and has put the &s;ervants into laced liveries; and moreover in&s;i&s;ts on our having a man-cook: <Q REND="inline">"for, (&s;ays he) I &s;hall often bring home &s;ome of my brother members to dinner; and, you know, my dear, they are u&s;ed to good living, and mu&s;t have their things well done."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="117">As my hu&s;band has hitherto always behaved in a prudent and rea&s;onable manner, this &s;trange ex|travagance would almo&s;t per&s;uade me that he was out of his &s;en&s;es, if I did not &s;ee that a fooli&s;h in|fatuation, and I know not what idea of being in parliament, has &s;ei&s;ed his mind. This, he tells me, is the cri&s;is of his fortune, and that his &s;ucce&s;s in his election will prove the making of his fa|mily. A &s;eat in parliament he looks upon as a mere earne&s;t of the honours which he is hereafter to enjoy. He a&s;&s;ures me again and again, that the mo&s;t eminent per&s;ons in the kingdom have ri&s;en to their pre&s;ent dignities by the &s;ole force of parliamentary talents; and that for his own part he has no doubt of making his way, now he has once got into the road of preferment. He &s;eems &s;o &s;ure to carry his point, that he even threatens to take no notice of any of his relations, but &s;uch as &s;hall &s;hew him due attention and re&s;pect; and he has ju&s;t determined to &s;end our elde&s;t boy, who is about nine years of age, to We&s;tmin&s;ter School, becau&s;e he thinks he has di&s;covered in the lad &s;ome|thing of an <HI>oratorical</HI> turn. I am very well a&s;&s;ured, from all his conver&s;ation and behaviour, that his va|nity prompts him to believe that he &s;hall make him&s;elf of con&s;equence in parliament; and I am
<PB N="94" REF="118">
very much afraid that he will open his mouth, almo&s;t immediately after he has taken his &s;eat, and expo&s;e him&s;elf in publick; for I, who am partial to him, yet know him too well to imagine that any &s;ucce&s;s can attend his efforts to &s;hine in eloquence or politicks. You may &s;mile, perhaps, Sir, and think that I con&s;ider the matter too minutely; but I am fully per&s;uaded, that he often means to try the &s;trength of his talents as a &s;peaker, on me and the little circle of familiar friends that drop in to vi&s;it us. He takes up every thing in a &s;tile of ar|gument and authority, runs the ea&s;y chat of con|ver&s;ation into politicks, and talks with much ve|hemence for a long time together upon &s;ubjects which neither I, nor any of my female acquaintance, can at all comprehend. He tells me over and over, alone and in company, that there is a great &s;cene opening upon us, that the commencement of a new reign, and a new parliament, mu&s;t of cour&s;e produce great events; and that tho&s;e who have the able&s;t talents for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e, will be the mo&s;t certain to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves and reap the greate&s;t &s;hare of honour and profit.</P>
<P>For my part, Sir, I am no Mrs. We&s;tern, and pretend to no &s;kill in politicks; neither am I of opinion, that a candidate's being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wealth
<PB N="95" REF="119">
enough to bribe his con&s;tituents, ought to re|commend him to their choice; but I am fully &s;a|tisfied, that a con&s;iderable degree of poperty is nece&s;&s;ary to his integrity, &s;ince, without it, the greate&s;t talents will not avail to pre&s;erve his in|dependence. My hu&s;band, for example, publickly declares, and &s;eems to affect a con&s;equence from it, that he &s;hall always go with His Lord&s;hip: he &s;eems, indeed, to be &s;o involved in his parliamentary &s;y&s;tem, that he has quite lo&s;t &s;ight of his dome&s;tick oeconomy. While he is bringing his va&s;t &s;chemes to bear, he will be every day ha&s;tening his ruin. The &s;ucce&s;s, with which he is &s;o elevated, is a piece of good fortune that brings de&s;truction along with it; for what advantage can be derived from any preferment, which requires a man to make his expences amount to above double the value of his receipts? I can account ea&s;ily enough for the man|ner in which we are to &s;upport our way of liv|ing during the pre&s;ent year; and the &s;ame fore&s;ight convinces me, that it will be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for us to go through another. The follies of mo&s;t married men are charged on their wives; but this, I am &s;ure, has, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, been pur&s;ued, as well as undertaken, much again&s;t my con&s;ent. It was with a heavy heart that I &s;aw my hu&s;band
<PB N="96" REF="120">
enter into this project; and it was with &s;till greater unea&s;ine&s;s I &s;aw him per&s;i&s;t in his town-&s;cheme, &s;ince I am well convinced, that our jour|ney to London mu&s;t end, like Sir Francis Wrong|head's, in a journey into the country again.</P>

<P>THE Anemolian Women are equal in beauty even to the Circa&s;&s;ians, and have al&s;o learned from &s;ome Europeans, who were ca&s;t away on their coa&s;t, the &s;ame method of pre&s;erving that beauty from the ravages of the mo&s;t cruel of di&s;|tempers. This uncommon beauty would give them almo&s;t an ab&s;olute power over the men, if they did not them&s;elves u&s;e their utmo&s;t efforts to dim its lu&s;tre, and to nip their growing charms in the bud, or to de&s;troy them in their full bloom: for, as the indelicate females among the Hottentots twine the fat and entrails of animals round their arms and legs, and rub their bodies with filth, thinking thereby to heighten their charms, and render their figures more agreeable; &s;o the women of Anemolia, not content with that portion of charms which heaven has allotted them, are perpe|tually retouching by art the beautiful originals of nature, till they become the mo&s;t execrable daubs that ever were beheld. If a prince had a palace built of hand&s;ome &s;tone, or perhaps the fine&s;t mar|ble, beautifully variegated by the hand of na|ture in the quarry, &s;hould you not e&s;teem him a madman to cover it with plai&s;ter and rough ca&s;t?
<PB N="99" REF="123">
What then &s;hall we &s;ay of the women of A nemolia, who pollute the &s;acred temples of their per&s;ons by encru&s;ting them with a coat of Ceru&s;s, and dead|ening the native vivacity of their features with an artificial enamel? A practice &s;o unnatural has, I find, betrayed me into metaphor and allu&s;ion; but the fact, as heaven &s;hall pro&s;per me, is literally true. Fir&s;t, they varni&s;h their faces, necks, and arms, like a whitened wall; and then they lay fan|ta&s;tick colourings, red, brown, or black, according to their various imaginations, upon that ground. Some females have the art of blanching their necks with a curious preparation, which hard|ens on their bo&s;oms, like mortar in a building; and, like that too, will abide all the changes of the &s;ea&s;ons for an whole year. But this proce&s;s re|quires time, and confines the lady that &s;ubmits to it, for &s;ome weeks. During the time that I was in ANEMOLIA, I remember it was once the darling piece of &s;candal among the ladies of quality in NIROE, the capital of that country, that a noble|man's daughter (who, for a few days, cea&s;ed to ap|pear at publick places) had ab&s;conded, in order to be delivered of an illegitimate child: but the real truth was, that the young lady lay in bed a month merely to bring the cru&s;t on her neck
<PB N="100" REF="124">
to a proper con&s;i&s;tency, and bake it, as it were in an oven; and at the end of that period, &s;he en|tirely defeated the malice of her enemies, and con|futed their &s;lander, by coming forth with a gho&s;tly bo&s;om, and as dead a white as alaba&s;ter. The greate&s;t misfortune attending this, and every other practi&s;e of the like nature, is, that it &s;oon utterly de&s;troys that exqui&s;ite beauty which at fir&s;t it &s;erves but to eclip&s;e. The mixtures u&s;ed for the&s;e pur|po&s;es are, it &s;eems, compo&s;ed of poi&s;on, &s;o that few retain any of their original charms after they are three or four and twenty years of age; and many of them, even before that period, become horrible to look upon. One of the prevailing beauties at court, at my arrival in ANEMOLIA, was, in a few weeks afterwards, &s;truck blind; another object of publick admiration &s;oon after lo&s;t all her teeth at once; and a third was &s;uddenly deprived of the u&s;e of her limbs, as it were by a &s;troke of the pal&s;y, and became bed-ridden. Such dreadful occurrences happened daily, and yet the ri&s;ing ge|neration of females continued the practice. This, among many other follies, was originally imported from ACHORIA, where it is not quite &s;o wonder|ful that it &s;hould prevail; for the women of that country, being naturally of a dark and dingy
<PB N="101" REF="125">
complexion, and de&s;titute of the delicacy peculiar to tho&s;e of ANEMOLIA, more readily recur to the re|&s;ources of art to mend the imperfection of nature.</P>

It is impo&s;&s;ible that any females &s;hould be guilty of &s;uch dete&s;table wick|edne&s;s, or give into &s;uch gro&s;s ab&s;urdity. The accurate reader will ea&s;ily conjecture, from &s;ome peculiarities of expre&s;&s;ion in the above extract, that I have rendered the original with great ex|actne&s;s.

<P>The women of Anemolia, con&s;cious of the attraction of their form, and vain of the ele|gance with which they flatter them&s;elves they have embelli&s;hed it, are fond of di&s;playing all its va|rious excellencies.

<P>Moreover, among the ANEMOLIANS the trade of courtezans, exce&s;&s;ive drunkenne&s;s, the open exerci&s;e of profane &s;wearing, and all manner of gaming, are, undoubtedly, licen&s;ed by the laws of the land. I had not time indeed to make a very nice &s;crutiny into their con&s;titution, and go regu|larly through the three hundred thou&s;and volumes in which their laws are enrolled; but am never|thele&s;s a&s;&s;ured that I cannot be deceived in this,
<PB N="103" REF="127">
circum&s;tance, becau&s;e the vices above-mentioned are &s;o openly practi&s;ed, even under the no&s;e of the magi&s;trates, that I am very confident they mu&s;t have obtained the &s;anction of publick au|thority. As &s;oon as the evening comes on, a large number of loo&s;e women are ordered to i&s;&s;ue forth into the &s;treets, and to u&s;e their utmo&s;t efforts to decoy pa&s;&s;engers into certain hou&s;es appointed for their reception. Stated quarters of the metro|polis are particularly dedicated to the purpo&s;es of riot and debauchery, where lu&s;t, drunkenne&s;s, and bla&s;phemy, hold their con&s;tant reign; while, in other di&s;tricts of the capital, &s;ome of the fir&s;t dig|nitaries of the &s;tate, principally concerned in the legi&s;lature, have in&s;tituted &s;ocieties of gaming: and, indeed, there are few polite families, which have not their meetings of this nature.</P>
<P>The open practice of &s;o many exorbitant vices, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, created in me much a&s;toni&s;hment at my fir&s;t arrival in the kingdom; but I was, on fur|ther reflection, inclined to con&s;ider this extraordi|nary licence, not to &s;ay licentiou&s;ne&s;s, as the effect of deep policy. The promi&s;cuous commerce with loo&s;e women is perhaps encouraged in order to turn the minds of the young men from any attempt at adultery, which, it &s;eems, was formerly too
<PB N="104" REF="128">
prevalent in ANEMOLIA. But the trade of cour|tezans is not only thus authorized, but the benevo|lence of the publick has al&s;o in&s;tituted nur&s;eries for their education, appointed noble provi&s;ions for them in their pregnancy, as well as receptacles for their children, and a comfortable retreat for them|&s;elves.&mdash;It were al&s;o to be wi&s;hed, on account of &s;ome &s;mall inconveniencies at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, that the courtezans were obliged to wear a num|bered ticket, like the porters and hackney coaches among you in England, and made re&s;pon&s;ible to certain commi&s;&s;ioners for their behaviour in their profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Drunkards, and profane &s;wearers, as well as common beggars, are, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;uffered to infe&s;t the publick &s;treets, like the intoxicated &s;laves which the Lacedaemonians exhibited to their children, in order to deter others from tho&s;e odious practices and &s;candalous ways of life: but why every mode of gaming is pur&s;ued among them with &s;o much zeal and vehemence, unle&s;s it be a part of their religion, I am quite at a lo&s;s to de|termine or comprehend. On the &s;ame principles with tho&s;e above-mentioned, &s;uits at law are em|barra&s;&s;ed with a thou&s;and perplexities, prolonged by the mo&s;t tedious delays, and loaded with mo&s;t heavy expences. The wi&s;e cau&s;e of all the&s;e
<PB N="105" REF="129">
troubles attending legal di&s;putes, is, merely to deter the citizens from idle litigations which is evident from their proceedings in matters of a cri|minal nature. There the offender is brought to an immediate trial, his offence is immedately exa|mined with the utmo&s;t expedition, and the &s;entence of the law put into immediate execution; upwards of three hundred criminals being publickly hanged every new moon.</P>

<P>As to the religion of the country, as I hinted above, I am not able to give a very clear account of it. I was, indeed, in doubt, for &s;ome time, whe|ther the ANEMOLIANS had any &s;y&s;tem of wor&s;hip e&s;tabli&s;hed among them; but ob&s;erving that there was one day, which the commonalty devoted to plea&s;ure and di&s;&s;olutene&s;s, I found, upon enquiry,
<PB N="106" REF="130">
that it was their u&s;ual manner of celebrating the &s;abbath. So far from being de&s;titute of a religion, they may be &s;aid to be over run with religions; as a different per&s;ua&s;ion prevails in every &s;treet, nay, almo&s;t in every hou&s;e. They have many wi&s;e teachers, learned in matters of divinity, among their artizans and mechanicks; and there are al&s;o &s;everal &s;agacious elderly females who take upon them the care of in&s;tructing their own and the other &s;ex in all points of religious faith. Some of them maintain Polythei&s;m, others are given to Dei&s;m, and a great number of them are reli|giou&s;ly devoted, if I may u&s;e the phra&s;e on this oc|ca&s;ion, to Athei&s;m. The Europeans, who were thrown on the coa&s;t, introduced Chri&s;tianity among them; but, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, the true Faith has not taken deep root in ANEMOLIA. Some in|deed among them, per&s;ons of the pure&s;t lives, were &s;truck with the force and dignity of its precepts, and readily embraced the tenets of Chri&s;tianity: but &s;coffers at its doctrines &s;oon aro&s;e without number; and &s;everal authors of the mo&s;t eminent abilities, and elevated rank, have made it their particular &s;tudy to write again&s;t its doctrines, mi|racles, &amp;c. though it mu&s;t be owned, that there

<P>I am almo&s;t afraid that what I am now going to relate will hardly obtain credit, as it is &s;o diametri|cally oppo&s;ite to the cour&s;e of things in every other part of the globe. Few, if any, of the ANEMO|LIANS die a natural death. Such as are not put to death by the hands of ju&s;tice, or accidents, or &s;ud|denly taken off by apoplexies, pal&s;ies, or the like, fall by &s;elf-murder. The rage of &s;uicide comes on regularly, like the moulting-time of birds, at a particular &s;ea&s;on of the year, which commences at the fall of the leaf. Mechanicks, and other people of mean condition, commonly hang or drown them&s;elves; &s;tate&s;men generally die by poi&s;on; and mo&s;t of the nobility fall on their &s;words, or &s;hoot them&s;elves through the head. About the middle of November every pond is filled with carca&s;es, and dead bodies hang on every tree. I was extremely &s;hocked at this impious prodigality of their lives; but the &s;urvivors among the natives are not at all affected by it, and behold the daily &s;uicides, committed by their neare&s;t relations, without the lea&s;t emotion. They told me, that it was con|&s;titutional, either originally in their natures, or
<PB N="108" REF="132">
generated in them by the climate. They further a&s;&s;ured me, that if I remained long among them, the fogs, which are &s;o thick and frequent in that country, would by degrees oppre&s;s my &s;pirits, and fill me with a horror of life, and all its attendant vexations.&mdash;Other rea&s;ons might, indeed, be a&s;|&s;igned.&mdash;However, I was &s;o &s;hocked and alarmed at this information, that I departed from their country the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>

<P>SWIFT, by way of de&s;cribing a reigning controver&s;y of tho&s;e times, has left us a mo&s;t droll and humourous account of a battle of the books in St. James's Library; and Boileau in his
<PB N="109" REF="133">
Lutrin has, with equal plea&s;antry, brought the two adver&s;e parties in his Poem together in a book|&s;eller's &s;hop, where they break out into open war, and convert the books into weapons of offence. Many harmle&s;s volumes are torn from their &s;helves, and fly through the air as thick as hail; and many a French divine lies &s;prawling beneath the weight of hard-bound poetry, heavy &s;y&s;tems of philo&s;ophy, and huge bodies of the law,</P>
<P>Such a de&s;cription, as that of the French writer, would, I think, be peculiarly applicable to the frequent and violent quarrels among authors. The Republick of letters is in a kind of perpetual civil war, and the beginning of every winter may be con&s;idered as the opening of a new literary cam|paign. The &s;hort &s;ummer truce, hardly kept with good faith, is &s;oon violated; and, while heroes &s;u&s;pend the &s;hedding of blood in war, au|thors contend which &s;hall &s;pill mo&s;t ink in contro|ver&s;y. One di&s;charges the blunderbu&s;s of his wit, and out comes an ode: a &s;econd, after whetting the ru&s;ty &s;word of his Genius, cuts you with a &s;a|tire: a third&mdash;but it is endle&s;s to go through all the weapons of elegy, &s;ong, epigram, &amp;c. and recite the whole artillery of wit&mdash;to it they go <HI>p&eacute;le-m&eacute;le,</HI> and, in&s;tead of making a general attack on vice
<PB N="110" REF="340">
and folly, confine them&s;elves to individual knaves and fools, and fall on one another. It is fortunate enough for all new adventurers in the&s;e literary en|gagements, that they do not make war exactly after the manner de&s;cribed by Boileau; but that every author throws his work, like a bomb, into the town, leaving it to do what mi&s;chief it may, without immediately levelling the volume it&s;elf at the head of his antagoni&s;t. If that were the ca&s;e, as at the book&s;eller's in the Lutrin, we have among us many authors, that would be mo&s;t for|midable adver&s;aries even to Homer him&s;elf; writers, who could overwhelm all the poets and philo&s;o|phers of antiquity with a deluge of literature, and carry all before them in a torrent of folios, quartos, and duodecimos, of their own compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>One would imagine, that every author is a na|tural enemy to every other author; and that the pur&s;uit of letters, which &s;hould refine and huma|nize the mind, &s;erves only to embitter it. No princes can be more jealous of a neighbour's growing power, than &s;ome authors of a cotempo|rary's infant fame. In their own reputation too they are tender even to &s;orene&s;s, and do not con|&s;ider, that all, who court applau&s;e, may, at the &s;ame time, be &s;aid to &s;olicit cen&s;ure. Accordingly,
<PB N="111" REF="135">
each writer has his flatterers and his enemies; and, if he is vain enough to li&s;ten to the adulation of one &s;et of men, and weak enough to feel the malice of the other, he becomes the mo&s;t unhappy being upon earth. The very nature of his employ|ment betrays him and his quarrels to publick ridicule. Other men differ, and are reconciled in &s;ecret; but the contention of authors is &s;tudi|ou&s;ly carried on in the mo&s;t open manner, and they cut each other to pieces, like prize-fighters, for the diver&s;ion of the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>The great &s;ucce&s;s of one or two giant &s;atyri&s;ts, of tran&s;cendant abilities, has tempted almo&s;t every puny witling to imagine that &s;ame and infamy are at his di&s;po&s;al. He gives you to under&s;tand, that, unle&s;s you pay due homage to his extraordinary Genius, your name &s;hall be regi&s;tered in the black &s;croll of di&s;grace; and he &s;tands, like a fretful porcupine, ready to dart his quills at all that make him angry. There are, however, a few con&s;ide|rations, not unworthy the attention of a writer &s;o &s;ubject to irritability. He may, undoubtedly, be of infinite con&s;equence to him&s;eif: every man, e&s;pecially every author, is &s;o: but it is ten to one if he is of equal con&s;equence to the publick: his works indeed, if they are the re&s;ult of Genius, may
<PB N="112" REF="136">
engage their attention; but his private differences will mo&s;t probably be thought impertinent. I do not know a more ridiculous circum&s;tance than a couple of &s;cribblers, both big with vanity, calling each other fool and blockhead. It is exactly the &s;cene of Vadius and Tri&s;&s;otin in Moliere; which I am &s;urpri&s;ed that no one, in this age of authors, has tran&s;lated for the Engli&s;h &s;tage.&mdash;Another re|flection,, which might curb their head-&s;trong Pega&s;us, if he runs riot on the high road of &s;atire, is, that, after all, let him write ever &s;o bitterly, and ever &s;o well, the publick are candid and impartial, and will give him credit no farther than he confirms their own &s;entiments, and echoes back their own opinion. Pope him&s;elf has not been able to rob the eternal butt of his invective, Colley Cibber, of one grain of applau&s;e that is due to him; and the united efforts of both him and Swift, powerful as they were, were levelled in vain again&s;t Dryden, Vanburgh, Steele, and I will not add Addi&s;on. The be&s;t an&s;wer that an author can make to another who calls him dull (that dreadful &s;entence!) is to write as well as he can; and if he is not able to confute him that way, he becomes his own &s;atiri&s;t. But the chief con&s;ideration, which &s;hould abate the &s;everity of irritated writers, is,
<PB N="113" REF="137">
the danger of failing in their attempt. To maim and murder reputations, to hack and hew, and ga&s;h at random, is, indeed, what any butcherly &s;cribbler may attempt; but to keep up the fine edge of true &s;atire, requires a very ma&s;terly hand: and if his &s;atire proves uncouth, and his execution coar&s;e, it turns back with ten-fold force upon him&s;elf, and fa&s;tens on him the odious imputation of malice without wit, and envy without abi|lities.</P>
<P>But the wor&s;t con&s;equence flowing from this ill blood between the writers of our times, is, that it di&s;courages many men, po&s;&s;e&s;t of noble talents, from exerting them in the cau&s;e of literature. Fearful of being engaged in this illiberal war|fare, they will not venture to commit their pieces to the pre&s;s. They would patiently abide the cor|rection of fair critiei&s;m, but do not care to provoke unmannerly cen&s;ures.&mdash;In this temper of mind the following lines &s;eem to have been written: at lea&s;t, it was the peru&s;al of them which threw me into the above vein of reflection. Having read them &s;everal times over with plea&s;ure, I was inclined to try their effect upon my readers, e&s;pecially as I cannot di&s;cover in them a line that appears to be <HI>per&s;onal.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OF all the qualifications of the mind, which are not po&s;itive virtues, I do not know any that is more de&s;irable than Good Humour. No quality renders the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or more ea&s;y and happy in him&s;elf, or recommends him more forcibly to other people. Virtue it&s;elf receives additional lu&s;tre, abates the rigid &s;everity of its character, and takes its mo&s;t ravi&s;hing graces and embelli&s;hments from &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition; a di&s;po&s;ition &s;o amiable in its nature,
<PB N="118" REF="142">
that even a man of loo&s;e principles, when of &s;o agreeable a turn, often conciliates to him&s;elf many friends and well-wi&s;hers. The men at lea&s;t allow that he is a plea&s;ant fellow, court his company, and account him no-body's enemy but his own; while the women call him a dear agreeable creature, and declare that though, to be &s;ure, he is a wild devil, it is quite impo&s;&s;ible to be angry with him.</P>
<P>It is hardly &s;aying too much in favour of this quality, to a&s;&s;ert that it is one of the fir&s;t requi&s;ites in &s;ociety: for though &s;trict honour and integrity are of more e&s;&s;ential value in the grand purpo&s;es of human life; yet Good Humour, like &s;mall money, is of more immediate u&s;e in the common com|merce of the world. There is no &s;ituation in life, no engagement in bu&s;ine&s;s, or party of plea&s;ure, wherein it will not contribute to mitigate di&s;ap|pointments, or heighten enjoyment. A hu&s;band, friend, acquaintance, ma&s;ter, or even &s;ervant, however faithful or affectionate, will occa&s;ion many mi&s;erable hours to him&s;elf, as well as to tho&s;e with whom he is connected, if his virtues are not &s;ea&s;oned with Good Humour; and whether he is a partner for life, or a partner in a country-dance, an a&s;&s;ociate in great and mighty undertak|ings, or a companion in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, he &s;hould,
<PB N="119" REF="143">
on every occa&s;ion, cheri&s;h and keep alive this agreeable di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons may almo&s;t be &s;aid to be of a good-humoured complexion, and &s;eem to be con&s;tituti|onally endued with this amiable turn of mind: a ble&s;&s;ing, for which they may thank heaven with the &s;ame kind of gratitude that he ought to feel, who experiences the comforts of being born in a de|lightful and temperate climate. My fellow-coun|try-men, I think, are many of them deficient in that airy plea&s;antne&s;s, and chearful temper, that di&s;tingui&s;hes this quality: and as our climate, while it an&s;wers all the purpo&s;es of u&s;e and plenty, yet &s;eldom affords us blue &s;kies, or tempts us to cool grots and purling &s;treams, to lie down on the damp gra&s;s, or to tho&s;e other rural delights &s;o often mentioned by the poets; &s;o the Engli&s;h them&s;elves, though overflowing with humanity and benevo|lence, &s;uffer clouds of gloomy thoughts to come over their minds, and, however they mu&s;t be al|lowed to be <HI>good-natured,</HI> are &s;eldom remarkable for being <HI>good-humoured.</HI> Yet this half-virtue is worth cultivation, as it be&s;tows new charms on that real one. Good Humour is the fair-weather of the &s;oul, that calms the turbulent gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, and diffu&s;es a perpetual gladne&s;s and &s;erenity over
<PB N="120" REF="144">
the heart; and he that finds his temper naturally inclined to break out into &s;udden bur&s;ts of fret|fulne&s;s and ill-humour, &s;hould be as much upon his guard to repre&s;s the &s;torm, that is for ever beating in his mind, as to fence again&s;t the incle|mencies of the &s;ea&s;on. We are naturally attached even to animals that betray a &s;oftne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition. We are plea&s;ed with the aukward fondne&s;s and fi|delity of a dog: Montaigne could di&s;cover agree|able mu&s;ick in the good-humoured purring of his cat; and, though our modern grooms and jockies be&s;tow all their attention on make, colour, eyes, and feet, yet the be&s;t writers on hor&s;eman&s;hip con|&s;ider a good temper as one of the be&s;t qualities in a hor&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be the more attentive to encourage and pre&s;erve this plea&s;ing quality, becau&s;e many people lo&s;e it by little and little in the progre&s;s of their lives. The thoughts of intere&s;t frequently proves a growing ru&s;t and canker in the mind; and the many troubles and embarra&s;&s;ments at|tending worldly pur&s;uits often &s;our the temper, and entirely de&s;troy the &s;pirit of chearfulne&s;s and Good Humour that prevailed in the artle&s;s and un|de&s;igning &s;ea&s;on of our youth. I do not know a more di&s;agreeable companion, than a man, who,
<PB N="121" REF="145">
having &s;et out in life with va&s;t and vain hopes of advancement, together with a mighty con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own merit, has not been able to &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock of di&s;appointment, but has permitted his misfortunes to embitter his di&s;po&s;ition. Such a man overflows with gall on every occa&s;ion, and di&s;charges the &s;pleen, that ri&s;es within him, on all his fellow-creatures. He di&s;turbs the peace of the family to which he belongs, and poi&s;ons the hap|pine&s;s of every company to which he is admitted. But the di&s;quiet that he brings with him, where|ever he comes, is nothing but an evidence of his own mi&s;ery and weakne&s;s of &s;oul. How much more is he to be imitated, who meets the &s;trokes of fortune with an even temper, who &s;uffers neither reproach nor di&s;tre&s;s to ruffle his Good Humour, and is, as Hamlet de&s;cribes his friend, <Q REND="inline">"As one, in &s;uffering all, that &s;uffers nothing!"</Q> Life is like a game at backgammon; and if an unlucky throw comes, we mu&s;t make the be&s;t of it, and play on without grumbling at our ill luck: but who would venture to &s;it down to the table with a man who could not bear an adver&s;e ca&s;t without turning over the board in a fury, and throwing the dice-box at the head of his companion? The character of Sir Thomas More, though peculiarly illu&s;trious for
<PB N="122" REF="146">
un&s;haken integrity, was in no in&s;tance more winning and amiable than in true plea&s;antry and Good Hu|mour. His chearful behaviour on the &s;caffold, and in every particular relative to his death, is fa|miliar to all; but there is no circum&s;tance in which the evenne&s;s of his mind is more truly delineated, than in his behaviour to his family on his re&s;igna|tion of the Chancellor&s;hip. The way in which he di&s;covered it to his wife be&s;poke the mo&s;t genuine Good Humour. When he went out of church, it was always u&s;ual for &s;ome of his officers to go to his lady and acquaint her of his departure: but the Sunday after his re&s;ignation, he went him&s;elf up to her pew, and, bowing, gravely &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Madam, My Lord is gone.</HI>"</Q> She, who was accu&s;tomed to the facetiou&s;ne&s;s of his manner, did not immedi|ately comprehend his meaning; but on his ex|plaining the matter to her, as they went home, &s;he began to upbraid him for his &s;hameful inattention to his intere&s;t; upon which, without being at all di&s;concerted by this conjugal lecture, he took oc|ca&s;ion to turn the di&s;cour&s;e, by finding fault with &s;ome part of her dre&s;s.&mdash;This ab&s;olute command of temper, and plea&s;ant vein, is &s;urely to be envied; and he who &s;ees the goods of fortune fall from him, not only without &s;haking his fortitude, but al&s;o
<PB N="123" REF="147">
without abating the gaiety of his heart, may fairly be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s an uncommon &s;hare of Good Humour.</P>
<P>SURLY is a man of an ea&s;y fortune, humane and benevolent in his nature, and, as Dogberry &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"hone&s;t as the &s;kin between his brows;"</Q> but he has contracted a kind of habitual peevi&s;hne&s;s, and every common occa&s;ion of life affords him matter of offence. The in&s;tant he ri&s;es in the morning, he is di&s;quieted with the appearance of the weather, and pours forth execrations on the climate; and when he &s;its down to breakfa&s;t, the water is &s;moaked, the butter rank, the bread heavy, the news-paper dull and in&s;ipid, and his &s;ervant &s;ulky or imper|tinent: yet all the while, he has no malice in his mind, and means no harm to any creature in the world. He has a thou&s;and good qualities, which the quickne&s;s of his temper converts into petulance and ill humour. He is a great lover of wit, but cannot bear the lea&s;t piece of plea&s;antry on him&s;elf; and the mo&s;t innocent je&s;t touches him to the quick. He will be&s;tow twenty pounds in an act of charity, or do the kinde&s;t offices to &s;erve an acquaintance in di&s;tre&s;s, and the next mo|ment quarrel with his friend for di&s;turbing his reflection by humming an opera-tune. Thus
<PB N="124" REF="148">
SURLY lives, much e&s;teemed, and little beloved; and though every body thinks well of him, there are very few that care to cultivate his acquaintance.</P>
<P>But if the want of Good Humour is &s;o con&s;pi|cuous in a man, of how many charms does it deprive one of the other &s;ex! &s;oftne&s;s is their di&s;|tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tick; but though, like milk, they are naturally &s;mooth, yet, like milk, they create particular di&s;gu&s;t when they turn &s;our. No female character is more offen&s;ive than a Shrew; and the impolite &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h law has provided very rough treatment for termagants, and pre|pared the &s;evere&s;t di&s;cipline for the cure of a &s;cold. The greate&s;t reproach on an old maid, that cha|racter &s;o much dreaded and ridiculed in the female world, is her ill humour; and cro&s;&s;ne&s;s is the wor&s;t part of a prude. On the contrary, Good Humour, like the Ce&s;tus, encircles the fair one with new beauties, and is an antidote to the ravages of age and the &s;mall-pox. It is the be&s;t part of the portion with a virtuous wife, and a mo&s;t amiable feature in the face of a Queen.</P>
<P>Among our own &s;ex, there is no race of men more apt to indulge a &s;pirit of acrimony, and to remit their natural Good Humour, than authors. They come abroad, indeed, with a con&s;ummate &s;elf-&s;atisfaction
<PB N="125" REF="149">
and delight; but the lea&s;t &s;hock given to their vanity taints the mind, and converts all their plea&s;antry to rancour. The flame of emu|lation often kindles into envy; and the&s;e met|tle&s;ome gentlemen pre&s;s &s;o furiou&s;ly onward to the goal of fame, that they are &s;ometimes driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of jo&s;tling one onother in the cour&s;e. For my part, I would rather chu&s;e to con&s;ider my&s;elf on a journey than in a race; and &s;urely it is better and plea&s;anter to jog on in an ea&s;y trot, regardle&s;s who is left behind, or who is gone before, than to whip and &s;pur a jaded Genius, and, in the heat of furious &s;pleen and blind rage, to be carried perhaps on the wrong &s;ide of the po&s;t.</P>
<P>Good Humour is the happie&s;t &s;tate of mind for a writer, as well as for every other man. Why &s;hould an author &s;uffer every hornet of the pre&s;s to ruffle his temper, or dip his pen in gall, and prepare wormwood draughts to &s;weeten the ill blood of a cotemporary? He that cau&s;ele&s;ly and malignantly traduces another, writes a libel on him&s;elf; as the highwayman, who makes an attack upon the road, is, in fact, a greater enemy to him&s;elf than to the harmle&s;s traveller: &s;uch a poor wretch, we know, as well as the re&s;t of the gang, will be
<PB N="126" REF="150">
brought to ju&s;tice &s;ooner or later; but no body cares to have their deaths lie at his own door. As for the GENIUS, though he ventures to become a Cen&s;or, he will never de&s;cend to the office of Ex|ecutioner. Even the Mu&s;e of Satire &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s her graces; and her productions, like the Sweet|brier, &s;hould delight and refre&s;h the &s;en&s;es by their fragrance, while they are armed for our annoyance. If we cannot exerci&s;e the in&s;truments of wit, we can at lea&s;t lay by the weapons of offence and ill nature; and the candour of the Briti&s;h Publick will always countenance the fainte&s;t efforts to railly the reigning vices and foibles of the age with chearfulne&s;s, plea&s;antry, and GOOD HUMOUR.</P>

He had al&s;o &s;ome conceits about the <HI>Homunculus,</HI> which, however, I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to explain at pre&s;ent, as a re|verend friend of mine, who is deeply ver&s;ed in tho&s;e &s;tudies, has promi&s;ed to oblige me with a di&s;tinct paper on that &s;ubject. He then con&s;idered the notions of planetary influence; according to which, all the various actions and di&s;po&s;itions of the human &s;pecies are governed &s;olely by the &s;tars. On this occa&s;ion, he a&s;&s;ured me, that an eminent a&s;tronomer of his acquaintance was very fatal at ca&s;ting nativities; and, moreover, that the late re|volution in the mini&s;try was ab&s;olutely foretold la&s;t year in Partridge's Almanack. He dwelt a little on the &s;uppo&s;ition of the &s;tubborn race of mortals being formed from the &s;tones thrown, as is related by Ovid, over the heads of Deucalion and Pyrrha. From thence he made a quick tran&s;ition to that kindred Hypothe&s;is, which &s;uppo&s;es, that our frames are kneaded out of clay; in pur&s;uance of which, he thought, it was natural to imagine, that the

affections of the mind take their tincture from the ve&s;&s;el in which they are inclo&s;ed, and are impreg|nated, like water, with the qualities of the purer, or ba&s;er earth through which they make their way.</P>
<P>With the&s;e reflections, the bottle and the cover|&s;ation, as is u&s;ual among Engli&s;hmen, ended to|gether, and I retired to my re&s;t. Yet I found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;hake off at once the vein of thought which we had been indulging for three or four hours together; and &s;leep it&s;elf, in&s;tead of to|tally di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing my mind of tho&s;e ideas, rather opened and enlarged my imagination to pur&s;ue them &s;till further.&mdash;The gentle reader is &s;eldom aver&s;e to accompanying the gentle writer in his &s;lumbers; wherefore I &s;hall venture to relate my dream.</P>
<P>I was &s;carce a&s;leep, when I fancied my&s;elf to be tran&s;ported on a &s;udden to the verge of the Gulph of Chaos; where, by the tran&s;ient glimmering of an interrupted light, which now and then fla&s;hed upon me, I &s;aw the Four Elements lying in confu&s;ion on the boundle&s;s deep, wherein, as Milton has described it,
<Q><L>&mdash;Hot, Cold, Moi&s;t, and Dry, Four Champions fierce,</L>
<L>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rive for the Ma&s;t'ry, and to Battle bring</L>
<L>Their embryon Atoms.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="154">I was much affected with the horror of my &s;itu|ation, and expected every moment to be plunged ten thou&s;and fathom deep into the gulph that lay before me, when there emerged from the waves, if I may &s;o call them, of this elemental ocean, a Being of a mild and benevolent a&s;pect, who, after landing on an eminence at &s;ome di&s;tance, beckoned me towards him with a &s;ort of Caduceus, which he held in his hand, and which was formed in the &s;hape of a Lizard, to &s;ignify that he was a friend to Mankind. My fear had deprived me of all power of motion; but the power of his rod drew me in&s;en&s;ibly to his &s;ide, as it were by a charm. His per&s;on was manly and noble: a &s;erene chearfulne&s;s was diffu&s;ed over his countenance: his garment was thrown loo&s;ely over him, &s;omewhat after the fa&s;hion of a Herald's Coat; and on the four quarters of it were delineated the figures of the Mole, the Whale, the Salamander, and the Camelion, as &s;ymbols of the Four Elements, over which, as it appeared, he pre&s;ided.</P>
<P>My &s;on! &s;aith he, I am the Genius of the Elements. In the va&s;t aby&s;s now before us lie all the future race of Mankind, as it were, in em|brio. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of certain &s;pirits, over which I pre&s;ide, to &s;elect from thence the crude
<PB N="131" REF="155">
materials, of which all Human Beings are com|po&s;ed. You, I know, are curious not only to en|quire into the various di&s;po&s;itions of your fellow-creatures, but to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es, to which their different manners and principles are owing. The&s;e cau&s;es I am now going to declare to you; wherefore attend!</P>
<P>Every Mortal is compo&s;ed of the Four Elements, but not in equal proportions, nor each mortal in the &s;ame degrees with another. On the contrary, men are, &s;everally, more or le&s;s agitated with this or that pa&s;&s;ion, or animated with a greater or &s;maller proportion of Genius, according to the nature of the particular Element that predominates in their frame; which prevailing Element, whether it be Earth, Water, Air, or Fire, creates the Ruling Pa&s;&s;ion, and influences every circum&s;tance of their lives.</P>
<P>In yonder quarter, continued the GENIUS, are formed the &s;ons and daughters of Earth; tho&s;e mortals, I mean, who take their exi&s;tence chiefly from that Element. The&s;e are, for the mo&s;t part, of a heavy and inanimate di&s;po&s;ition, of groveling &s;ouls and dull minds, and may be rather &s;aid to vegetate than to live. A few, and very few of the Female Sex are compo&s;ed of this Element;
<PB N="132" REF="156">
and the&s;e are &s;lutti&s;h in their hou&s;es, &s;latternly in their per&s;ons, and churli&s;h to their friends, rela|tions, and hu&s;bands. Tho&s;e of the Male Sex, that owe their origin principally to Earth, are tho&s;e mi&s;erly muckworms, who place their &s;ole happine&s;s in ama&s;&s;ing va&s;t &s;ums of money; tho&s;e locu&s;ts and caterpillars, who eat out the &s;ub&s;tance of others by extortion and u&s;ury. From this Element al&s;o are fabricated the race of &s;tupid criticks, and heavy commentators, half-philo&s;ophers, entire logicians, dry metaphy&s;icians, and muddling politicians; together with the whole tribe of wretched &s;crib|blers, whom your countrymen have &s;o properly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the denomination of Grubs. The particles of which the&s;e mortals are formed, weigh down their minds, and prevent their &s;oaring to any thing lofty or &s;ublime; for the &s;ame rea&s;on that fathers, according to the principle of that fa|mous chancellor Lord Coke, cannot take an e&s;tate by inheritance from their &s;ons, viz. <HI>becau&s;e Land,</HI> or Earth, <HI>being of a heavy nature, cannot a&s;cend.</HI> There are, however, among mortals of this terrene com|po&s;ition, &s;ome who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;olid parts and &s;ound un|der&s;tandings; and many, who&s;e minds are not barren or unfruitful, if they labour to improve them by due cultivation.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="157">On the banks of that Lake, &s;aid the GENIUS, pointing to another quarter, are created that part of the human &s;pecies, who draw their life and being from Water. The&s;e are commonly found to be cold and phlegmatick in their di&s;po&s;ition; men, who &s;helter their native dulne&s;s and inactivity under the names of caution and prudence; who damp the generous warmth of youth, repre&s;s the ardour of enterprize, and quench the flame of Genius; women, who can cry when they plea&s;e; &s;oaking &s;ots, who are far ever moi&s;tening their clay, till they grow maudlin in their liquor, and weep; lovers, who whine away their days in de&s;pair, till at la&s;t they take the Lovers'-Leap into their kindred &s;ea, or drown like blind puppies, in Ro&s;amond's Pond; tragick authors and actors, who want fire, and draw tears from no eyes but their own: all the&s;e owe their origin to Water. Among the&s;e watry &s;ouls, there are indeed &s;ome few, that may be con&s;idered as &s;alutiferous &s;prings, that are bene|ficial to their fellow-creatures; or, like noble rivers, which are an ornament, as well as ble&s;&s;ing, to the country through which they pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, &s;aid the GENIUS, rai&s;ing his head, turn your eyes upward, and behold the region from whence they take their being, who are compo&s;ed
<PB N="134" REF="158">
chiefly of Air. The&s;e are in general of a light and volatile di&s;po&s;ition; often fed with vain hopes, and plea&s;ed with empty trifles. Hence are derived the gay race of beaux and fops, who flutter, like but|terflies, about the polite world; and in this airy &s;phere are formed coquettes, jilts, and tho&s;e females, who are enraptured with romance, or eternally dying with the vapours. Hence de&s;cend poets, pro|jectors, and ca&s;tle-builders without number, who &s;eem to be perpetually endeavouring to climb up to the region from whence they came; and the long train of dependants, who &s;eem to have almo&s;t learnt to live, like the Camelion, on their native element, the Air. Hence come the light troop of E&s;&s;ayi&s;ts, Pamphleteers, Sonneteers, Epigrammati&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who&s;e productions have their beginning in Air, and end in Fire. Of this Element too are com|po&s;ed &s;ome daring &s;ouls, who take their bold flight, like eagles, and &s;oar to the noble&s;t heights; though never without being followed for a time with a multitude of crows, choughs, and ravens, who pur&s;ue them with hoar&s;e and di&s;&s;onant cawings, and di&s;turb earth and heaven with their clamour.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, continued the GENIUS, behold the bright di&s;trict where tho&s;e mortals are formed, who are compo&s;ed principally of Fire. The&s;e are, for the
<PB N="155" REF="159">
mo&s;t part, of a warm and pa&s;&s;ionate nature; among&s;t whom the virtues and vices are to be found in their extremes. Here too you may find men of hot heads, and ladies of warm con&s;titutions. Hence comes the termagant, who is all rage and fury, and the hero, who is all glory and gunpowder. Hence al&s;o comes the &s;pirited race of bucks, bloods, libertines, and freethinkers. Hence too are derived many of tho&s;e glorious and &s;ublime &s;ages, heroes, princes, poets, and philo&s;ophers, who&s;e Genius throws a lu&s;tre all around them, and who &s;eem to be placed, like beacons, amid&s;t the human &s;pecies, to hold forth lights to the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>Happy, &s;aid the GENIUS, is he, who has learnt to temper the irregularities of his frame, &s;o as to prevent the evil effects of the Element that prevails in his compo&s;ition! Happier &s;till is that man, in whom the Elements are mixed in the neare&s;t pro|portion to each other.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, whether from &s;udden noi&s;e, &s;uf|ficient re&s;t, a de&s;ire to reply, or from what other cau&s;e I know not&mdash;I awoke.</P>

<P>BATH, and Tunbridge, and Cheltenham, and Scarborough, and the other Watering Places of this kingdom, although many miles di&s;tant from the metropolis, and &s;ome of them &s;carce to be brought within the compa&s;s of a day's journey, even in this age of expedition, when
<PB N="137" REF="161">
the flying waggon is no extraordinary <HI>Phaenomenom,</HI> may yet be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as places of publick diver&s;ion belonging to the town. The Rooms in no wi&s;e re&s;emble other country a&s;&s;emblies, where the &s;quire commands re&s;pect, and derives additional authority from being in the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace; and the balls are quite in a different &s;tile from a dance at the a&s;&s;izes, where the alder|mens' wives and daughters &s;et off with the newe&s;t patterns, from London, are admitted to drop a curt&s;y to the ladies of the repre&s;entatives for the town or country, or, perhaps, even to the Lady Lieutenant. On the contrary, the company of the&s;e places make up the &s;ame fanta&s;tical medley, nay, con&s;i&s;ts of the very &s;ame per&s;ons as occa&s;ionally compo&s;e the groupe in the places of entertain|ment in and about London; and while we are &s;ure to encounter the well-known faces that haunt every hou&s;e and garden who&s;e doors are thrown open to receive them, notwithstanding the real di&s;tance, we can &s;carce &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves beyond the limits of the bills of mortality, any more than we are apt to fancy our&s;elves out of town, when we have ju&s;t got off the &s;tones towards Vauxhall or Ranelagh.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="162">In this light, at lea&s;t, I was tempted to con|&s;ider this matter in a late trip to Bath&mdash;with this only difference: in town, the company is brought together for a few hours only; and though &s;ome may have repaired thither on foot, &s;ome in equipages decorated with bloody hands and co|ronets, and others in coaches di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;quare plates of painted tin, yet, on their &s;epara|tion, who can tell what becomes of his late a&s;&s;o|ciates, any more than where they came from? At Bath, and the like places, each per&s;on may be &s;aid not only to exhibit him&s;elf for a time, but even to live in publick. He re&s;ides in a hou&s;e of gla&s;s, and all his words, actions, plea&s;ures, and at|tachments, are known to the whole circle of the little world he inhabits. Neither my lord, nor my lady, who di&s;dain to &s;in in private, nor the petty tre&s;pa&s;&s;er, who loves to be &s;nug in his offences, are exempt from ob&s;ervation. Almo&s;t every body de&s;cants on the characters of others, and almo&s;t every body expo&s;es his own. It is a kind of ge|neral <HI>hob</HI> or <HI>nob,</HI> or give and take, as Shake&s;peare explains the phra&s;e, between all the good com|pany. The old, the young, the rich, the poor, the &s;ick, the well, Engli&s;h, French, Germans, Swi&s;s, and Italians, all live here together, as it were, in
<PB N="139" REF="163">
one family; and with as little emotion of mutual concern or regard, as tho&s;e who are really of one family, commonly have for each other.</P>
<P>Bath no more owes its entire &s;upport to mere in|valids, than the univer&s;ities are filled with real &s;tu|dents; or than the Temple coffee hou&s;es are totally maintained by lawyers that have bu&s;ine&s;s, or Child's and Bat&s;on's by phy&s;icians that have practice. If every &s;aunterer in the Pump-Room was to be &s;trictly interrogated concerning the motive of his coming thither, or the manner of his pa&s;&s;ing his time there, di&s;&s;ipation, play, and intrigue, would appear to have drawn after them a larger retinue than the gout or the cholick. A per&s;on, who is fond of taking an e&s;timate of manners and prin|ciples, might find here much matter of &s;pecula|tion. For my own part, being too poor to game, too well to drink the waters, too dull, or too bri&s;k, too wi&s;e, or too fooli&s;h, too in&s;en&s;ible, or too what you will, to fall in love, I remained an idle &s;pec|tator of the bu&s;y &s;cene before me; and like a dull geographer, without pretending to account for the nature of the &s;oil, or to di&s;cover the &s;everal &s;prings and mines that lay underneath, I contented my&s;elf with taking a cur&s;ory &s;urvey of the place,
<PB N="140" REF="164">
and drawing out a map from what appeared on the face of the country.</P>
<P>It affords abundant matter of congratulation to this kingdom, that notorious games of hazard, &s;uch as the E. O. Tables, and the like, are at length bani&s;hed from the&s;e places, as well as from the ma&s;|querade and ridotto. There are &s;till, it is true, to be found &s;everal hungry cormorants, eager to feed on the ignorant or unwary; and &s;tudious to make u&s;e of the opportunities ari&s;ing from the pro|mi&s;cuous mixture of the cheat and the dupe, the gentleman and the &s;harper. They, however, who are weak enough to fall a prey to the&s;e &s;harks of &s;ociety, are the le&s;s to be pitied, as they &s;eem to devote them&s;elves to de&s;truction with their eyes open. The characters of the&s;e vagrant gamblers are generally notorious. He, therefore, who ven|tures his hundreds again&s;t the la&s;t &s;take of a fellow, whom he would not admit into his hou&s;e, or &s;peak to, but acro&s;s the card-table, &s;urely &s;uffers him&s;elf to be robbed, while he feels the hand of the cut-pur&s;e in his pocket; and has no more right to complain of ill treatment, than if he had de&s;cended to play with link-boys, and pick pockets in a night cellar.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="165">Far be it from me to endeavour, with rude hand, to force open the cabinet of love, or to unlock the &s;ecrets of the Temple of Cupid! Love, how|ever determined on &s;ecrecy, is apt to break out and betray it&s;elf unawares, to make it&s;elf known by a thou&s;and little inadvertencies and ab&s;urdities in our conduct, the involuntrary emotions of ten|derne&s;s. Rather, therefore, would I admoni&s;h the&s;e &s;weet triflers, in the &s;uppo&s;ed words of Ca&s;&s;io to De&s;demona, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>let us be wary! let us bide our loves!</HI>"</Q> in order to which, let them ab&s;tain from billing and cooing in publick, from rolling of eyes, and &s;queezing of hands, and joining of knees under the table! Idlene&s;s and curio&s;ity are ever on the watch; and Scandal, like Virgil's Fame, has as many eyes as tongues. It is a maxim at Bath, and all other publick places, that when a young couple have been partners at a ball for two nights to|gether, every other point is &s;ettled between them; whereon the banns of marriage are publi&s;hed in the Rooms, long before the time for their declaration any where el&s;e. Making love may be, and no doubt is, a very engaging entertainment to the parties concerned; but there is no &s;cene of court&s;hip, which does not appear exttemely ridi|culous in the eyes of an indifferent &s;pectator.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="166">But if the &s;parks of honourable love are, in the&s;e common haunts of men, to be thus cautiou&s;ly repre&s;&s;ed from bur&s;ting into a blaze, what &s;hall we &s;ay to the unwarrantable ebullitions of the &s;pirit of intrigue? If a fine lady, ju&s;t broke loo&s;e from her hu&s;band, or a warm widow lately relieved from the yoke of matrimony, have a mind to give their pa&s;&s;ions full play, why need they adverti&s;e their in|tentions to the whole world? Or, if a &s;prightly young fellow has &s;ubdued some frail piece of fe|male virtue, is it not cruel to make his conque&s;t publick? In a word, why &s;hould both parties prefer an open &s;corn of virtue and decorum to the concealment of their vices? It would be too rigid and unrea&s;onable to debar per&s;ons of &s;pirit en|tirely from their plea&s;ures. I would only advi&s;e them to be temperate and di&s;creet in the u&s;e of them. The cuckoldly hu&s;band might put his horns quietly into his pocket, if he was not indu&s;triou&s;ly pointed out for a mon&s;ter; and the world might wink hard at female frailties, if they did not provoke atten|tion, and peremptorily challenge ob&s;ervation. Open gallantries are &s;ure to become the &s;ubject of town-talk; and the rumour of Bath and Tunbridge intrigues is as quickly calculated through the
<PB N="143" REF="167">
be&s;t company, as a box on the ear indi&s;creetly dealt at Ranelagh.</P>
<P>There is no part of the&s;e mixt a&s;&s;emblies, which I am apt to con&s;ider with more compa&s;&s;ion, than tho&s;e unfortunate young females, who&s;e wi&s;e rela|tions are fond of carrying them to and fro, from one publick place to another, by way of introducing them early to the knowledge of the world, or as the means of getting them a hu&s;band. There is, indeed, no &s;ituation, where a decent and amiable be|haviour in a young lady would be more con&s;pi|cuous: but tho&s;e, who have been formed on the above-mentioned &s;y&s;tem of education, have com|monly lo&s;t all their dome&s;tick graces, without having acquired any allurements in exchange for them. They know the rules and cu&s;toms of publick places, without being in the lea&s;t acquainted with the manners of the world, which are not to be collected in a giddy life of perpetual di&s;&s;ipation, or learnt with the graces of a minuet, and the figure of a country dance, or picked up by chance at the lottery table; as a proof of which, it &s;eldom hap|pens, that the&s;e female pupils of <HI>Flirtation</HI> con|tract an advantageous match, though they often fall a prey to the profe&s;&s;ed rake or libertine. Or, if that is not the ca&s;e, they are hawked about
<PB N="144" REF="168">
from place to place, till <HI>the bloom is off the plum,</HI> when, (to pur&s;ue the allu&s;ion) many nau&s;eate the fruit, &s;o &s;oon is grown dead and &s;tale in the market, which perhaps they would have gathered with plea&s;ure, if it had been left to hang its due time upon the tree.</P>
<P>If there are any characters of this motley drama that move our mirthful indignation more power|fully than all the others, it is the &s;warm of humble retainers to the Great, that are for ever buzzing in the ear of nobility. The ea&s;y intercour&s;e be|tween per&s;ons of different ranks, which this place affords, is particularly grateful to the&s;e <HI>&s;punges,</HI> as Hamlet terms them, who delight to &s;oak up the countenances of people of fa&s;hion. This nu|merous tribe is made up of both &s;exes; and happy is he or &s;he who can be occa&s;ionally called in to fill up a vacant corner in her Grace's party at Qua|drille; and how woeful is the mortification, if they &s;hould fail to edge them&s;elves into his Lord&s;hip's tea-drinking! Such &s;elf-made depen|dants, who are engendered by the &s;miles of the Great, like flies or maggots out of carrion by the rays of the &s;un, have no idea of any di&s;tinction between per&s;ons, except that which title be&s;tows on them. They &s;eem indeed to &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves
<PB N="145" REF="169">
noble and genteel by reflection, though they &s;ink in the e&s;timation of others, in proportion as they ri&s;e in their own. They are con&s;idereed in ge|neral as runners to the great, that fetch and carry, come and go, as they are bid. Though they flatter them&s;elves that they mix in the polite world, they live but in the &s;uburbs and out-&s;kirts of gen|tility. They are, in truth, but a mean appendage to the great, a higher, but yet more infamous degree, of pages and lacquies to hold up the tail of nobi|lity, or rather a contemptible part of the train it&s;elf; a narrow edging or border, a kind of beggar's tape that binds the hem of quality.</P>
<P>The late and ever-memorable Richard Na&s;h, E&s;q. who&s;e name is almo&s;t as much revered at Bath, as that of the great Bladud him&s;elf, for &s;ome few years before his death publi&s;hed propo&s;als for printing, by &s;ub&s;cription, The Hi&s;tory of BATH and TUNBRIDGE. Many, who &s;ub&s;cribed largely to this work, contrary to the ca&s;e of all other &s;ub|&s;criptions, would have been much di&s;appointed and offended, if it had ever made its appearance; &s;o that the price of &s;ub&s;cription might be con&s;idered as hu&s;h-money, to keep the intrigues and gal|lantries of the nobility in &s;ilence. The original papers, containing many curious anecdotes, are
<PB N="146" REF="170">
fallen into my hands; and, unle&s;s the dukes and dutche&s;&s;es, peers and peere&s;&s;es, in general, and others the gentry of this realm, will &s;ub&s;cribe their <HI>five guineas</HI> to me, The GENIUS, as nobly as they did to the fir&s;t author, the work &s;hall certainly come out. In the mean time, the manu&s;cripts are lodged in the hands of an eminent coun&s;el, as it is &s;aid was the ca&s;e with &s;ome of Pope's Epi&s;tles and Satires, that we may be enabled to go ju&s;t upon the edge of libel and <HI>&s;candalum magnatum.</HI> Tho&s;e who would not have their adventures and amours recorded in this &s;ecret hi&s;tory, may take the gentle hint I now give them, and &s;end in their &s;ub&s;crip|tions to the printer of this paper. In the mean time, I would recommend it to Me&s;&s;rs. Wilt&s;hire and Sim&s;on at Bath, as well as to the proprietors of the pump-room, and ma&s;ters of the coffee-hou&s;es, to hang the rooms with the ST. JAMES's CHRO|NICLE.</P>

<P>ON my return home a few evenings ago, I found lying on my table a &s;oiled knave of diamonds, bearing evident marks of having &s;erved in &s;everal campaigns, which I found, on exa|mination, to come from my old acquaintance, Mrs. Marrcourt, and to contain an invitation, written in her own old Engli&s;h black letter, to a private party at cards, on Monday the fourth of January.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marrcourt is the widow of a gentleman who had a place in the hou&s;ehold, and at her hu&s;|band's death obtained, by the intere&s;t and &s;ollici|tation of &s;ome powerful friends, an annual pen&s;ion
<PB N="148" REF="172">
of a hundred and fifty pounds. Having had, as &s;he often &s;ays her&s;elf, a very genteel education, and always lived in a polite &s;phere, &s;he entertains the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect for all per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, as well as an implicit veneration for all the manners, appurtenances, and dependences, of quality. Wherefore, notwith&s;tanding the nar|rowne&s;s of her income, &s;he never could endure the thoughts of being exiled from the great world, but has been reduced to &s;everal &s;hifts to maintain the appearance of a tolerable footing in it. Being now grown aged and infirm, &s;he cannot well crawl through the park in fair weather, or along the be&s;t paved &s;treets to pay her morning vi&s;its. She is, however, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;t &s;edan of a counte&s;s of her acquaintance, by whom &s;he was honoured with it as a pre&s;ent &s;even years ago; but being un|able to pay her chairmen the u&s;ual rates for weekly attendance, &s;he drives a hard bargain, and retains them at an under price; whence it often happens, that her two chairmen are not only in liveries of two different colours, but &s;he is obliged to be car|ried by all the raw-boned, unpracti&s;ed fellows, who jumble along in a rough trot, as unea&s;y as a &s;tage-coach over the &s;tones; and no &s;ooner have they learnt to pace along in the true human amble, and
<PB N="149" REF="173">
become capable of better bu&s;ine&s;s, than they de&s;ert the good old lady, and their places are &s;upplied by a fre&s;h pair of hackney novices; &s;o that &s;he has 'the breaking-in of mo&s;t of the two-legged colts in town. She has apartments in one of the old palaces, <HI>gratis</HI>; and during the &s;ummer-months, becau&s;e &s;he would not, for the world, be &s;o ungenteel as to &s;tay in London, &s;he takes a two-penny lodging at Greenwich or Richmond. She con&s;tantly vi&s;its at &s;everal great hou&s;es, and though often &s;hut out, by per&s;everance and the utmo&s;t good-breeding, &s;he is &s;ometimes let in, and perhaps, if there is no particular company, a&s;ked to &s;tay dinner. The ladies treat her with a haughty familiarity, and &s;tile her plain Marrcourt: and the facetious men of fa&s;hion make mock love to her, compliment her, in the &s;train of well|bred raillery, on her per&s;on, beauty, ta&s;te, and other qualifications; freely indulging them&s;elves in all tho&s;e liberties, which young fellows, con|&s;cious and vain of their rank, are apt to take with their inferiors.&mdash;Yet, even from this kind of con|nection with people of di&s;tinction, does Mrs. Marr|court derive no &s;mall degree of con&s;equence. She remembers the day &s;he bought her la&s;t pound of tea, by recollecting it was the &s;ame on which &s;he
<PB N="150" REF="174">
dined at his lord&s;hip's; &s;he talks familiarly of Lady Harriot and Lady Mary; and is reckoned, by all the lower gentry of her acquaintance, to be <HI>a mighty genteel &s;ort of body, and to keep none but the very be&s;t of company.</HI></P>
<P>I waited on Mrs. Marrcourt on the evening appointed, but perceived, immediately on my entrance into her apartments, that although &s;he had given her a&s;&s;embly the mode&s;t appellation of a private party, &s;he had in fact collected all the company &s;he was able, with a particular view to bring together &s;ome per&s;ons of rank and dignity. Her two rooms, the large&s;t of which is &s;carce bigger than a cabin, and the lea&s;t a mere clo&s;et, were &s;o crouded, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that I could &s;queeze my little per&s;on &s;ideways between the backs of the chairs belonging to the &s;everal card tables, in order to make my way from one end of the place to the other. The tables were, many of them, placed diagonally, by which means &s;he had been able to edge in one or two extraordinary; and mo&s;t of the company, who were not put down to cards, &s;tood in a huddle by the fire-&s;ide, and the remaining few had di&s;po&s;ed them&s;elves in the &s;eats of the windows. The room was lighted up with the ends of wax-candles,
<PB N="151" REF="175">
bought of the duke of &mdash;'s butler, and the company regaled with a &s;mall liquor, made by Mrs. Marrcourt her&s;elf, in the pre&s;ent &s;carcity of lemons, of the be&s;t Cream o'Tartar. The com|pany it&s;elf was as mi&s;cellaneous as a pack of cards, or any hand that can be formed from different combinations of them; but the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed members of it, and to which I ob&s;erved Mrs. Marr|court paid particular attention, were, an old Iri&s;h peer, of a di&s;puted title, a Creolian colonel, a di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed baronet, a city knight and his lady, a French gentlewoman from the neighbourhood of Soho, an old general officer on half-pay, and a yellow ad|miral.</P>
<P>Such is the faithful picture of the good old lady's a&s;&s;embly; and without pretending to more than ordinary penetration, we may venture to pronounce that there are many Mrs. Marrcourts in this great metropolis. Nor is it any matter of &s;urpri&s;e; for if ladies of di&s;tinction will delight to throw open their great gates, and court the whole tide of no|bility to flow in upon them, there will ever exi&s;t the&s;e minor dames of &s;econd-hand gentry, fond of aping the vices and follies of their &s;uperiors. But though the imitation of bad things, like the cor|ruption of the be&s;t, renders them mo&s;t odious and
<PB N="152" REF="176">
contemptible, it may not be ami&s;s to carry our re|flections &s;till further, and to con&s;ider the nature of the polite&s;t of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, &s;et off with every circum&s;tance of elegance and &s;plendor.</P>
<P>The&s;e genteel meetings, like Milton's Pandaemo|nium, <HI>frequent and full,</HI> are, in the dialect of the fa&s;hionable world, denominated ROUTS; the &s;igni|fication of which word, according to dictionaries of the be&s;t authority, is as follows, John&s;on defines a ROUT to be <HI>a clamorous multitude; a rabble; a tumultuous croud:</HI> and Giles Jacob, in his Law Dictionary, declares the word ROUT to &s;ignify an ASSEMBLY <HI>of per&s;ons, gathered together, and going to execute, or indeed executing, an unlawful act.</HI> If we examine the thing it&s;elf as it appears in high life, we &s;hall be convinced of the propriety of the term, and cannot but allow that all the&s;e ROUTS, from that of a dutche&s;s down to Mrs. Marrcourt's, come within the meaning of both the&s;e de&s;criptions. For what is a ROUT but a <HI>tu|multuous croud; a rabble</HI>; that is, a genteel mob, or the rabble of quality, <HI>drawn together,</HI> as Jacob &s;ays, <HI>and going to execute, or indeed executing, an un|lawful act?</HI></P>
<P>But the prevailing idea is, undoubtedly, the Croud; and the lady, who is mi&s;tre&s;s of the ROUT,
<PB N="153" REF="177">
is happy in proportion to the numbers &s;he has been able to a&s;&s;emble. If the publick way is interrupted for three &s;treets together, and the company can &s;carce get to and fro between the hou&s;e and their coaches and chairs; if the boxes at the play or the opera are robbed of their company, becau&s;e tho&s;e, who are left uninvited, are a&s;hamed to betray the contempt or neglect they are doomed to &s;u&s;tain; if in the mo&s;t &s;pacious apartments in London, the company are crouded together, as clo&s;e as at Mrs. Marrcourt's, or as the poor pri|&s;oners in the black-hole at Calcutta; the triumph is more ample and complete. I remember a dutche&s;s and a counte&s;s, who for a time entertained the mo&s;t mortal aver&s;ion for each other, from having both appointed their Routs on the &s;ame day of the week. The whole town, at lea&s;t the polite part of it, was divided into parties; and ranking them|&s;elves, as under a banner, beneath the colours of the cards, were &s;everally called the Reds and the Blacks. The parties being equally powerful, and the Routs of each being of cour&s;e rendered le&s;s numerous, who can &s;ay to what extremities matters might have been carried, if a man of fa&s;hion, who, like a blank card, had yet received no impre&s;&s;ion either from Red or Black, had not
<PB N="154" REF="178">
fortunately compromi&s;ed the affair, and pre|vailed on the ladies to be content with taking the day alternately, each holding a Rout only once in a fortnight?</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that this rage for a Croud has produced a mo&s;t extraordinary revolution in dre&s;s. A friend of mine has compo&s;ed a mo&s;t ela|borate treati&s;e, in the manner of Monte&s;quieu, on the cau&s;es of the ri&s;e and fall of the hoop-petticoat. In the learned &s;ection on the &s;ubject of ROUTS, which is as curious as any chapter in Tri&s;tram Shandy, the author has plainly demon&s;trated, that the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies have produced a total revolution in architecture and dre&s;s. Every hou&s;e is built as if it was intended to receive the whole town; and every lady is dre&s;t as if &s;he was going into apart|ments where &s;he would not have room to turn her&s;elf round. The hoop, which had &s;tood the &s;hocks of ridicule for forty years together, which dilated it&s;elf wider and wider on every new attack, which incumbered whole apartments, &s;pread it&s;elf all over the Mall, eclip&s;ed beaux, and over&s;ha|dowed &s;ide-boxes, &s;hrunk in an in&s;tant, like a flower &s;hut up at &s;un&s;et, or a clo&s;ed umbrella. <HI>No Hoops</HI> became the common <HI>Nota Bene</HI> to all cards of invitation; and the ladies came abroad,
<PB N="155" REF="179">
&s;uddenly freed of all their tumours and incum|brances, like a new mother ju&s;t delivered of her burthen, or like the fallen angels in Milton, as on a &s;ignal given,
<Q><L>&mdash;to &s;malle&s;t Forms</L>
<L>Reduced their Shapes immen&s;e; and were at large,</L>
<L>Though without Number &s;till.</L></Q></P>
<P>It may almo&s;t be a&s;&s;erted, without a quibble, that the &s;y&s;tem of life, now e&s;tabli&s;hed in the polite world, &s;eems calculated to de&s;troy &s;ociety for the &s;ake of company. A Lady's Journal is a mere calendar of vi&s;its and routs; vi&s;its often paid by the footmen, with a &s;lip of card and a flam|beau; and Routs, where, in&s;tead of a few &s;elect friends, &s;he meets with a croud of half acquaintance and &s;trangers. ROUTS are the modern &s;chools of education for the female &s;ex; and as cards &s;eem to be de&s;tined for their &s;ole amu&s;ement and employ|ment, I would advi&s;e my good friend Mr. Newberry, the annual publi&s;her of the Ladies Me|morandum Book, to di&s;po&s;e his next into the po|pular form of a pack of cards, the two and fifty cards, of which the pack con&s;i&s;ts, naturally adapting them&s;elves to the u&s;e of the two and fifty weeks, into which the year is di&s;tributed. The
<PB N="156" REF="180">
&s;everal Sundays might be di&s;tingui&s;hed as the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, or fourth Sundays of the dutche&s;s of A's, the counte&s;s of B's, lady Van D's, or Mrs. E's Rout; and the little &s;paces allotted for ap|pointments, might be filled with &s;ecret a&s;&s;igna|tions, if it be true, (as the Chronicle of Scandal relates) that &s;uch a&s;&s;ignations are &s;ometimes made at the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>I have been the more earne&s;t to throw together my reflections on this &s;ubject at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e the female pa&s;&s;ion for ROUTS grows every day more and more predominant, and I am credibly in|formed that the contagion has actually &s;pread even to our colonies, and been carried by our country-women into other parts of the world. General A&s;&s;emblies, of no parliamentary nature, I am told, are frequently held in New England; the clerks of our Ea&s;t-India Company and their wives have, it is &s;aid, been known to lo&s;e a lack of rupees at a &s;itting at Bengal; and I am confidently a&s;&s;ured, that a lady of quality, on her travels, has &s;o far broke in upon the &s;implicity of the Cantons, as to have ab&s;olutely e&s;tabli&s;hed an evening a&s;&s;embly for halfpenny Lu in Switzerland.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to prevent the further evil con&s;equences re&s;ulting from the&s;e private publick
<PB N="157" REF="181">
gaming-hou&s;es, and at the &s;ame time not entirely to deprive per&s;ons of di&s;tinction of their favourite amu&s;ement, and yet to render it of &s;ome &s;mall utility and advantage, I would humbly &s;ubmit to the attention of the legi&s;lature the following plan of a ROUT-ACT. No lady, of what&s;oever rank, &s;hould be allowed to hold in one night more than three card-tables for Whi&s;t, Cribbage, or Quadrille; which, with a fourth for the u&s;e of the more promi&s;cuous games, &s;uch as Lan&s;quenet, Lu, Lottery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may fairly be &s;uppo&s;ed to comprehend all the per&s;ons that can meet at once for the &s;ake of &s;ociety. But, for the entertainment of tho&s;e, who delight in larger a&s;&s;emblies, two publick ROUTS &s;hould be in&s;tituted, with authority to open their doors every night, like the theatres: one to be held, for the u&s;e of the court end of the town, at Carli&s;le Hou&s;e, Soho Square; and the other, for the ladies of the merchants, aldermen, and common-council men, at Haberda&s;her's-Hall in the city. The card-money, as well as the &s;ums &s;ub&s;cribed for admi&s;&s;ion, (in&s;tead of being lavi&s;hed on butlers, <HI>valets,</HI> and <HI>maitres d'hotel</HI>) &s;hould be laid apart, in order to create a fund for the &s;upport of decayed game&s;ters, who&s;e nece&s;&s;ities might be &s;upplied by their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors at the gaming-table, as the &s;tage
<PB N="158" REF="182">
now and then gives a benefit for di&s;tre&s;t and &s;uper|annuated actors. By the&s;e means a lord, who has exhau&s;ted his fortune by deep play, need not degrade him&s;elf by application for a pen&s;ion; and a merchant who has, by the like conduct, involved him&s;elf and family in the mi&s;eries of bankruptcy, need not do the world and his creditors a further injury by going into bu&s;ine&s;s again.</P>

<P>OF all bodies of men, Authors may ju&s;tly claim the large&s;t &s;hare of publick &s;pirit. Stre|nuous advocates for the rights of the people, they have not only even &s;hewn them&s;elves vigilant guardians of the liberty of the pre&s;s, but have al&s;o recently manife&s;ted a noble contempt for what appeared to be their own more immediate concern,
<PB N="162" REF="185">
<HI>the property of the pre&s;s</HI>; a property which they have lately &s;een voted away with a true &s;toical apathy and indifference. They have &s;ilently be|held, like unconcerned &s;pectators, its very exi&s;tence denied, and have acquie&s;ced in the &s;ublime doctrine of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s to the greate&s;t extreme. Phy|&s;icians and lawyers avowedly plead and pre&s;cribe for a fee, &s;oldiers fight for pay, and even divines preach and pray for a benefice. The labourer, in other &s;tations, is reckoned worthy of his hire. Authors alone are content to have little other re|compen&s;e than fame for their labours, and quietly allow that a general <HI>imprimatur</HI> converts their works into general property. The indu&s;trious commonwealth of literature has been plundered of the wax and honey, without one of the exhau&s;tle&s;s hive endeavouring to fix his &s;ting into his &s;poilers: but in vindication of the <HI>liberty</HI> of the pre&s;s, not a drone but would join in in&s;tant commotion.</P>
<P>The Liberty of the Pre&s;s is indeed a mo&s;t glorious privilege. When it is but mentioned every En|gli&s;hman &s;wells with a con&s;cious &s;uperiority, and &s;eems to feel him&s;elf half an inch taller; if on the Continent, the thought almo&s;t adds a cubit to his &s;tature; yet this liberty, invaluable as it is, like all other liberty, has been &s;hamefully abu&s;ed; and has
<PB N="163" REF="186">
oftentimes been exerci&s;ed with the barbarity of &s;a|vages, rather than the gallant &s;pirit of freemen; by mon&s;ters wielding the pen, not as the &s;word of publick ju&s;tice or defence, but u&s;ing it as the in|&s;trument of ruffian violence and private rancour. In political di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, indeed, freedom of &s;enti|ment and &s;peech &s;hould be almo&s;t boundle&s;s: and a great and enterpri&s;ing genius, be&s;t able to go all lengths, might perhaps with great propriety try, <Q REND="inline">"how far the Liberty of the Pre&s;s could legally be carried:"</Q> but in writings of a private nature, that doctrine becomes &s;hameful and &s;candalous, and the practice almo&s;t diabolical. He who exerci&s;es the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, with no farther idea of re&s;traint, than what the law impo&s;es, may e&s;cape a partial pro&s;ecution, but will incur univer&s;al contempt: for the rogue within the law, as any attorney can te&s;tify, is the mo&s;t dangerous and de&s;|picable of all rogues. In a moral as well as a civil &s;en&s;e, every man's hou&s;e &s;hould in &s;ome mea&s;ure be his ca&s;tle; and the mi&s;creant who wantonly di&s;turbs the repo&s;e, or breaks into the harmle&s;s &s;ecrets, of a private family, commits a kind of literary bur|glary, and is almo&s;t as culpable as the mini&s;ter or king's me&s;&s;enger who &s;hould now attempt the <HI>&s;ei&s;ure of papers,</HI> or dare to enter a man&s;ion by a
<PB N="164" REF="187">
General Warrant. The Engli&s;h are a remarkably good-natured, as well as generous people; but were a &s;tranger to form a character of them from a peru&s;al of their daily publications, they would ap|pear to require a con&s;tant evening &s;acrifice to their ill-nature, and a hecatomb of reputations for their breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Seeing the colour of many other publications, and tho&s;e, alas, too generally popular, I mean oc|ca&s;ionally to hazard an e&s;&s;ay in this paper, of a complection totally different, and now and then to re&s;cue at lea&s;t one column, in one news-paper, from &s;candal and politicks. The rece&s;s of parliament, when the minds of men are le&s;s heated by con|tention, is a proper &s;ea&s;on to commence &s;uch an undertaking. For my own part, I am at pre&s;ent writing inclined to tru&s;t the intere&s;ts of my country, on both &s;ides of the Atlantick, to the three great branches of the legi&s;lature; but if I find them in|adequate or unfaithful, I &s;hall be happy with other authors to <HI>embody,</HI> like the con&s;titutional militia, in times of danger, and to change <HI>the Gentleman</HI> into <HI>the Politician,</HI> as Steele converted <HI>the Guardian</HI> into <HI>the Engli&s;hman.</HI> Even Quakers perhaps might, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, &s;u&s;pend the pacifick tenets of their per&s;ua&s;ion; and even &s;ome of our Clergy
<PB N="165" REF="188">
would, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, exhibit a new idea of Church Militant, change their gowns for coats of mail, and like a boiled lob&s;ter, turn from black to red.</P>
<P>It is however at pre&s;ent my wi&s;h and my intention to &s;uffer my patriotick powers of writing to &s;leep, like the &s;word in the &s;cabbard. Every Gentleman chu&s;es to wear one both for ornament and defence, but when he puts it on, &s;ays to him&s;elf with Mercutio, <Q REND="inline">"Heaven &s;end me no need of thee!"</Q> I will not, like the court-fool of old times, run a muck again&s;t the King and his Nobles; I will not draw my wit upon the Mini&s;ter; much le&s;s (as I have already profe&s;&s;ed) will I wound the bo&s;om of dome&s;tick tranquillity. I &s;end the&s;e fu|gitive papers &s;miling into the world, wi&s;hing them, like Swedes' Tea, to &s;weaten the blood and juices of my Countrymen, and to correct their ill hu|mours; but tho' intended for an antidote to black bile and acrimony, it is hoped they will not appear, like Magne&s;ia, a cure for the heart-burn indeed, but in them&s;elves a drug ta&s;tele&s;s and in&s;ipid. The ro&s;e and &s;weet-briar are not the le&s;s fragrant for the thorn that makes a part of them; and the powers of &s;atire and ridicule, while pointed at ge|neral vices and enormities, are not only innocent
<PB N="166" REF="189">
but &s;alutary. Bungling quacks cannot attack the di&s;ea&s;e, without injuring or perhaps killing the patient: but the true morali&s;t &s;ees the drama of &s;o|ciety performed before him, like the &s;kilful natu|rali&s;t contemplating bees through a gla&s;s hive, marking their operations, and turning them to account, without offering the bu&s;y in&s;ects the lea&s;t injury. The pre&s;ent age &s;warms with follies, and teems with characters worthy of ob&s;ervation. Such will be frequently exhibited; but as they are in|tended, like tho&s;e of the New Comedy of Me|nander, to be general, it is hoped that none of them will be challenged by any individual.</P>
<P>The Motto prefixed to this Indroductory E&s;&s;ay may perhaps be thought arrogant; but it is only meant to imply &s;uch &s;ubjects as are fit for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on a plan of this liberal nature, and &s;uch a cha|racter as the writer would wi&s;h to exhibit in the per&s;on of The Gentleman: not that he pre&s;umes to hint that he &s;hall him&s;elf be found equal to it. He means to derive his chief importance from the merits of others. As to him&s;elf, whether really a Gentleman, or the meane&s;t Plebeian; a &s;tudent at his ea&s;e, or a &s;cribbler in the Fleet; &s;itting by a &s;ilver &s;tandi&s;h in his own apartment, or with a broken ink-bottle in a garret or cellar; are matters
<PB N="167" REF="190">
of no importance to the reader, &s;o long as the author &s;hall &s;u&s;tain the part he has a&s;&s;umed. Though appearing in a publick character, he means to be namele&s;s and unknown. He has drawn up the curtain, like other managers, without ad|mittance behind the &s;cenes, an indulgence which might gratify the curio&s;ity of a few, but tends to de&s;troy the publick entertainment. In his bills the director can at pre&s;ent announce no more than <HI>The Gentleman,</HI> to which the wags (if they plea&s;e) may &s;ubjoin, <HI>being the fir&s;t time of his appearing in that character.</HI> I mu&s;t beg leave, however, once for all to declare, that with whatever notice they may honour me, to their wit or their dulne&s;s I &s;hall never make any reply; not from the &s;pirit of &s;ilent contempt, but rather on the principle of Fielding, who when he was told in the Green Room that the audience were damning his Comedy, acquie&s;ced in the badne&s;s of it, and cried, <HI>What! have they found it out!</HI></P>
<P>It has heen &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that it would be more con&s;onant to the character of a Gentleman, to &s;end forth my &s;peculations, like &s;ome of my predece&s;&s;ors, uncontaminated by paragraphs and adverti&s;ements, beautifully printed on a &s;heet and half of fine writing paper: but many of my

&s;uperiors, &s;everal excellent e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts, moral and political, have written in news-papers.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to be a BLACKGUARD, and if it had not been for a few touches in your paper, that &s;hewed you to be no enemy to Vulgar Manners, as well as no mean proficient in the Vulgar Tongue, I &s;hould have beheld your E&s;&s;ays with &s;ilent con|tempt, and would not have conde&s;cended to cor|re&s;pond with you. But is this a time, Sir, for a writer who means to amend the morals, or correct the behaviour, of the idle things, and puppies of the pre&s;ent age, to u&s;her a work into the world under the title of <HI>The Gentleman?</HI> Do not fal&s;e
<PB N="171" REF="194">
refinements, affected politene&s;s, and in a word, <HI>Gentility</HI> (as they term it) threaten to undermine our morals, pervert our good &s;en&s;e, and infect our be|haviour? Formerly it was the boa&s;t of this country, that every man might, in things indif|ferent, vary from his neighbour. Private Liberty was as e&s;&s;ential a mark of our manners, as Publick Liberty was the characteri&s;tick of our con&s;titution: no principles of politene&s;s, no &s;y&s;tem of beha|viour, no rules for rai&s;ing a French or Italian &s;u|per&s;tructure on a Gothick foundation, but every man built his reputation on the ba&s;is of good &s;en&s;e and good nature. At pre&s;ent we begin to refine, and file, and poli&s;h, 'till our manners, as Sterne &s;aid of tho&s;e of our neighbours, are growing as &s;mooth and undi&s;tingui&s;hable as an old King Wil|liam's halfpenny; and fa&s;hionable principles, like the legs of fa&s;hionable furniture, have &s;carce &s;trength enough to &s;upport the frame that belongs to them.</P>
<P><HI>Gentility,</HI> Sir, (give me leave to repeat and in&s;i&s;t on it) is the great bane of our lives, the nur&s;e of vice, di&s;&s;ipation and extravagance; the parent of bankruptcy, and &s;ource of corruption. Fo|reign manners will not thrive under our meridian. There is a kind of <HI>Magna Charta</HI> in our good
<PB N="172" REF="195">
fellow&s;hip, as well as in our laws, that will not brook the controul of an hone&s;t-hearty laugh, or endure to be fettered by Di&s;&s;ertations on Left Legs.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to the contemptible animal, the new-fangled being, that now commonly di&s;tin|gui&s;hes it&s;elf by the appellation of <HI>The Gentleman,</HI> I am proud to &s;tile my&s;elf <HI>A Blackguard</HI>; a name, Sir, that would do you more credit both as a writer, and a man, than the title you have a&s;&s;umed. Hu|mour, that genuine Engli&s;h production, is not the growth of a frippery age, nor founded on poli&s;hed manners. It can only be cultivated by bold manly wits, &s;uch as Cervantes, Rabelais, Moliere, Swift, Gay, Arbuthnot, Fielding, Sterne, &amp;c. &amp;c. The&s;e, and &s;uch as the&s;e, are the Cla&s;&s;icks of the School of Blackguard. In that &s;chool I have been bred, and have learnt to de&s;pi&s;e a delicacy of manners that produces effeminacy, and a nicety of ta&s;te that proves the weakne&s;s of the &s;tomach. If the&s;e are models you di&s;approve, I here take my leave of you; but if Engli&s;h Virtue, Engli&s;h Sen&s;e, and Engli&s;h Humour, are meant to be recommended and encouraged by the Author of <HI>The Gentleman,</HI> he &s;hall now and then, if he plea&s;es, hear farther from one who is proud to own him&s;elf a friend to tho&s;e qualities, and to &s;ub&s;cribe him&s;elf</P>

<HEAD>To the <HI>GENTLEMAN.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DOES your total &s;ilence, concerning the female world, in your fir&s;t number, proceed from contempt of the Sex? Do you think, with Ma|homet, that Women are void of &s;ouls to be made happy in the next world; or, with a late Lord, that they are incapable of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e in the pre&s;ent? During the female reigns of Anne and Elizabeth, &s;uch doctrines would
<PB N="174" REF="197">
have been con&s;idered as moral and political he|re&s;ies, no le&s;s than religious: and they de&s;erve, I think, as little encouragement in our times, when we &s;ee a Queen Con&s;ort on the throne, at lea&s;t equally amiable, and perhaps as wi&s;e in declining politicks, as the illu&s;trious regents above-menti|oned were glorious in admini&s;tring them.</P>
<P>Familiar E&s;&s;ays, Sir, have hitherto been pecu|liarly devoted to the &s;ervice of the Ladies. Steele and Addi&s;on &s;tept forth, like literary knights-errant, to re&s;cue the fair from the daemons of vice, and &s;pells of ignorance, endeavouring to render the toilet the altar of the Mu&s;es, as well as the place of &s;acrifice to the Graces. They thought the manners and principles of Women not unimportant to the happine&s;s of Men, and did not e&s;teem it a di&s;grace to their parts or learning, to <HI>write down</HI> to the under&s;tandings of female readers. E&s;&s;ays in ge|neral are, indeed, a kind of whipt-&s;illabub lite|rature, not above the pitch of a mere hou&s;ewifely comprehen&s;ion, and as becoming a part of the par|lour-window furniture, as a tambour or a thread paper.</P>
<P>I do not mean, Sir, by what I have &s;aid, to accu&s;e you of an elevation of &s;tyle and manner that throws us at a di&s;tance, but rather to hint to you that
<PB N="175" REF="198">
a &s;eeming neglect of the Ladies is not con&s;i&s;tent with a writer, who &s;tiles him&s;elf A Gentleman. Are you afraid that the di&s;tingui&s;hed propriety, ele|gance, and decent mode&s;ty of the females of the pre&s;ent age will afford you no room for animad|ver&s;ion? Or do you think them totally incorri|gible? For my part, Sir, I believe them to be formed of the very &s;ame materials, as their mothers were before them, equally prone to err, and equally capable of amendment and in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Female virtues are certainly of con&s;equence to the order of the moral world, and foibles ought not to be &s;uffered to &s;pring up neglected, and to over-run the mind like thorns and idle weeds: yet their delicacy is not to be wounded. Their follies mu&s;t be tenderly probed, and the E&s;&s;ayi&s;t, like the Surgeon, &s;hould have the hand of a Lady. Shake|&s;peare's Characters of Women, like the portraits of women by the Pre&s;ident of our Royal Academy, are almo&s;t the only good ones drawn by men. There is a coar&s;ene&s;s of outline, colour, and de&s;ign, in mo&s;t other arti&s;ts, that make their Ladies appear not in the &s;imple &s;tyle of Caelia, Ro&s;alind, Imo|gen, De&s;demona, &amp;c. but rather like men dre&s;t in women's cloaths. On the&s;e con&s;iderations there|fore, while you, Sir, are engaged in painting the
<PB N="176" REF="199">
Men, the Females &s;hall, if you plea&s;e, &s;it to Me: or if you will &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf alone equal to fini&s;hing the main parts of the figure, you will at lea&s;t allow that a Female hand is mo&s;t likely to be correct in the drapery,</P>
<P>You will, I doubt not, be extremely curious to be informed from whom this Letter proceeds, and vanity may perhaps incline you to &s;uppo&s;e, that it is occa&s;ioned by &s;ome partiality to you or your writings. Your per&s;on, Sir, I do not know, nor at pre&s;ent de&s;ire to know, any more than I mean to di&s;cover my own. Whether I &s;hall ever unveil my&s;elf, mu&s;t appear hereafter. In the mean time, let your imagination draw as flattering a likene&s;s of me, as Gentlemen-Quixotes picture to them&s;elves of their &s;everal Dulcineas. Fancy me as young, hand&s;ome, rich, and agreeably accompli&s;hed, as your complexion, avarice, or vanity may require, and it is no matter how old, ugly, poor, and di&s;a|greeable I may really be, while I remain your a&s;&s;i&s;tant and humble &s;ervant,</P>

<P>Till the Lady becomes acquainted with my name, character, and qualifications, &s;he is de&s;ired to take it for granted that I am very tall, very well

made, exactly of the complection &s;he likes be&s;t, and ju&s;t in my prime. In the mean time I mo&s;t thankfully accept her kind offer, and do not doubt but it will be agreeable to my fair readers. The ladies have indeed betrayed &s;ome partiality for male hair-dre&s;&s;ers, &s;tay-makers, mantua-makers, and even men-midwives: yet I think they will un|bo&s;om their failings more freely to one of their own &s;ex; and any lady, labouring with &s;pleen, malice, envy, ambition, avarice, or &s;ecret di&s;orders of the mind, will be glad to be laid by a woman: e&s;pecially as an able and experienced practitioner (meaning my&s;elf) will always attend, ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t in any very nice ca&s;e or an accident.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LEARNING, like beaten gold, in proportion to its being more extended, becomes more &s;uperficial. Gro&s;s ignorance and profound eru|dition are now equally uncommon. Literature,
<PB N="179" REF="202">
no longer confined to colleges and cloi&s;ters, mixes it&s;elf in &s;ome mea&s;ure with the commerce of the exchange, the exerci&s;es of the camp, and the graces of the court: but the deep-read &s;cholar is a rarer character than ever. The main &s;tream of &s;cience, branching into numberle&s;s rivulets, grows &s;hallow, as well as clear. The &s;tores of learning are parcelled out by retail, and what was &s;arca&s;tically &s;aid of the reputed knowledge of our northern neighbours, is nearly applicable to that of the whole i&s;land. Every man has a mouthfull, but no man has a bellyfull.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation, on the &s;tate of learning in ge|neral, is almo&s;t equally true in re&s;pect to the le&s;&s;er
<PB N="180" REF="203">
graces of Style and compo&s;ition. That happy me|diocrity, denied by Gods and Men to the writers of former ages, has been re&s;erved for our own period. Few writers are barbarous and ungram|matical, or even unmu&s;ical, in their language; but very few are truly &s;imple, nervous, or elegant. Some &s;tyles, like hand&s;ome faces, are &s;poilt by affectation, or ruined by varni&s;h and extrin&s;ick or|nament; &s;ome are bloated with fal&s;e pomp; &s;ome darkened by metaphy&s;ical ab&s;tract phra&s;eology; and &s;ome enervated by dapper familiarities, and the cant jargon of drawing-rooms, hor&s;e-cour&s;es, and gaming-tables.</P>
<P>Purity of Style, like purity of manners, is not wholly practicable: languages, like men by whom they are framed, will be imperfect: yet every en|deavour to trace the &s;ources of corruption, tends to &s;top its progre&s;s. Living authors, as well as living manners, are at once the chief objects of our cen&s;ure and imitation. The works of decea&s;ed writers, which we have been taught by tradition to applaud, are too &s;eldom turned over; while the productions of our cotemporaries pre&s;ent them|&s;elves to our notice, oftener than their per&s;ons. He, who has talents to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf from
<PB N="181" REF="204">
the crowd, has more followers than an ancient phi|lo&s;opher. A popular writer &s;ets the fa&s;hion of Style, and the very herd of criticks, that wi&s;h to depre|ciate the value of his works, run after him. If an author ari&s;es, who&s;e deep learning, and large imagination &s;truggling for expre&s;&s;ion equal to his conceptions, tempt him to lengthen his periods, and &s;well his phra&s;eology; if an intimate famili|arity with the combinations of a dead language now and then betray him into too wide a deviation from the vernacular idiom; &s;uch a writer will have the mortification to &s;ee the beauties of his Style di&s;torted by aukward imitation, and his errors (if in him they are errors) made ridiculous by ag|gravation. The language that, in his ma&s;ter hand, like a well-tuned in&s;trument, <Q REND="inline">"di&s;cour&s;es mo&s;t eloquent mu&s;ick,"</Q> under their management utters nothing but di&s;cord. The rattling of their periods and tumidity of their phra&s;es, like the noi&s;e of a drum or &s;well of a bladder, are but &s;ymptoms of their wind and emptine&s;s.</P>
<P>Ornament of diction, &s;ays Quintilian, tho' the greate&s;t of beauties, is only graceful, when it follows as it were of it&s;elf, not when it is pur&s;ued. Of all ornaments, a foreign &s;tructure of period, as it is the mo&s;t prejudicial to the genius of our language,
<PB N="182" REF="205">
appears the mo&s;t &s;tudied and unnatural. An adopted word is but a partial and trifling innovation, and is often happily incorporated, when care is taken to naturalize the foreigner, by giving a na|tional air to the turn of the phra&s;e. Every lan|guage, more e&s;pecially the Engli&s;h, has its idioms, which we &s;hould not regi&s;ter, with Grammarians and Lexicographers, among its irregularities, but with Poets and Orators, number among its beauties. To extirpate idiom from our tongue, would be like rooting up the old oaks, that are the glory and ornament of our country; or, to vary the allu&s;ion, to &s;quare the language of our ancient writers to the rigid rules of Roman or even French Syntax, would extingui&s;h the genius of our Tongue, and give the whole a foreign air, like the labours of a ta&s;tele&s;s improver, exchanging the luxuriance of nature, in our gardens, for clipt yews, &s;trait walks, and formal parterres.</P>
<P>Per&s;picuity without meanne&s;s is pronounced by Ari&s;totle to be the perfection of language, or, as he more nervou&s;ly expre&s;&s;es it, the <HI>virtue</HI> of Style; to attain which, he recommends, as a principal in&s;trument, the u&s;e of the mo&s;t common words and phra&s;es in a figurative &s;ignification; the familiarity of the terms rendering them clear, and the novelty
<PB N="183" REF="206">
of their application giving them an air of elegance or dignity. The works of our old writers, pro|&s;aick as well as poetical, abound with the&s;e home|&s;pun metaphors, by which the lowe&s;t words in|crea&s;e their con&s;equence, or at lea&s;t, like cyphers, rai&s;e the value of their neighbours. Sometimes, indeed, the&s;e popular tropes are carried to exce&s;s, or u&s;ed too licentiou&s;ly; yet they commonly breathe a magnificent &s;implicity, and the whole con&s;truction is purely Engli&s;h; a circum&s;tance, like that which induced Cicero to recommend the &s;tudy of the an|cient Roman authors to his pupils in oratory, urging, that whoever was well read in their pro|ductions, could not, were he even inclined to it, &s;peak other than genuine Latin.</P>
<P>It will not, I hope, be imagined from what I have &s;aid, that I think too lightly of the labours and genius of tho&s;e learned philologi&s;ts, who, by compiling Grammars and Dictionaries, have en|deavoured to give preci&s;ion and &s;tability to our Tongue. Their works, if properly con&s;ulted, are u&s;eful both to the learner and proficient; but if made the objects of their &s;tudy, rather than occa|&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tants, they will certainly be pernicious. The Grammars of living and dead languages are too often framed on different principles: in the
<PB N="184" REF="207">
latter, all irregularities, for which an authority can be pleaded, are &s;anctified by a rule; while the other brands every idiom, or bold combination, as a licentious barbari&s;m. No man ever learnt a lan|guage, living or dead, from a Grammar or Dicti|onary; but by reading the be&s;t authors, and par|taking of the be&s;t conver&s;ation. He, who habi|tuates him&s;elf to &s;uch &s;tudies and &s;uch &s;ociety, without propo&s;ing to him&s;elf a particular model, will in&s;en&s;ibly form a Style of his own; as in the mechanical part of writing, every man abandoning him&s;elf to his own fancy or powers, almo&s;t every man writes a different hand. A certain freedom of Style, a manly flow of language, will di&s;tingui&s;h the authors of &s;uch a &s;chool; who&s;e periods will not be divided into formal compartments, like the &s;quares of a Mo&s;aick pavement, exactly an&s;wering each other; but the members of a &s;entence, like the members of the human body, will &s;eem to be put together with ea&s;e as well as &s;ymmetry, and equally framed for the purpo&s;es of elegance and &s;trength.</P>
<P>As to Grammars and Dictionaries, though not admini&s;tering to the foundation of our tongue, they may certainly be of great u&s;e to contribute to its pre&s;ervation. They are a kind of &s;caffold erected
<PB N="185" REF="208">
by &s;kilful workmen, after our language has been completely built, to repair the ruins of time, and to keep the venerable &s;tructure from further decay. The la&s;t great Engli&s;h Dictionary will remain, as long as the Engli&s;h Tongue &s;hall remain, a mo|nument of the learning and genius of its author; and I cannot better enforce the utility of the &s;tudies recommended in this paper, than by concluding it with an extract from the admirable Preface to that work; a Preface, which at once delivers the precepts, and affords the example, of a pure and eloquent Style.</P>
<Q><P>&mdash;I have &s;tudiou&s;ly endeavoured to collect examples and authorities from the writers before the Re&s;toration, who&s;e works I regard as <HI>the wells of Engli&s;h undefiled,</HI> as the pure &s;ources of genuine diction. Our language, for almo&s;t a century, has, by the concurrence of many cau&s;es, been gradually departing from its original <HI>Teutonick</HI> character, and deviating towards a Gallick &s;tructure and phra&s;eology, from which it ought to be our en|deavour to recall it, <HI>by making our ancient volumes the groundwork of Style,</HI> admitting among the ad|ditions of later times, only &s;uch as may &s;upply real deficiencies, &s;uch as are readily adopted by the
<PB N="186" REF="209">
genius of our tongue, and incorporate ea&s;ily with our native idioms.</P>
<P>&mdash;From the authors which ro&s;e in the time of Elizabeth, a &s;peech might be formed adequate to all the purpo&s;es of u&s;e and elegance. If the language of theology were extracted from Hooker and the tran&s;lation of the Bible; the terms of natural knowledge from Bacon; the phra&s;es of policy, war, and navigation from Raleigh; the dialect of poetry and fiction from Spen&s;er and Sidney; and the diction of common life from Shake&s;peare, few ideas would be lo&s;t to mankind, for want of Engli&s;h words in which they might be expre&s;&s;ed.</P></Q>

<Q>Well then, not to dwell on the Bar, the Bench, the Pulpit, or the Parliament, what can, in our hours of relaxation, be more agreeable, or better &s;uited to our nature, than chearful, and elegant Con|ver&s;ation? For in this con&s;i&s;ts our chief pre-eminence over the brute creation, that we can conver&s;e with each other, and communicate our &s;entiments by Speech.</Q>

<P><HI>ECCE ITERUM!</HI> the Blackguard again! your la&s;t paper has rou&s;ed me, and while you are learnedly commenting on the Style of Writing, give me leave, Sir, to throw in a word or two on a
<PB N="188" REF="211">
matter of more immediate con&s;equence to the comfort and happine&s;s of life&mdash;the Style of Conver|&s;ation. I don't mean the rounding of &s;entences, or &s;aying pretty things prettily, or fine things finely, or backing your hor&s;es, like Mrs. Flourigig, in the mid&s;t of a &s;peech, for the &s;ake of turning the corner of a period; but the downright commu|nication of our thoughts to each other, the life and &s;oul of all &s;ocial intercour&s;e, the fir&s;t purpo&s;e of meeting and company, and the great di&s;tinction between our &s;pecies and the re&s;t of the animal creation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Speak, that I may know thee."</Q> &s;aid the wi&s;e man of old; but according to the pre&s;cribed u&s;e of &s;peech in polite company, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to come at the lea&s;t knowledge of each other; not on account of our u&s;ing &s;peech for the purpo&s;e of di&s;&s;imulation, but becau&s;e it is ungenteel for&s;ooth, to di&s;cover, in company, that you have any knowledge at all; or for any one per&s;on to &s;peak above five &s;econds at a time, or above five words in a breath.</P>
<P>Tediou&s;ne&s;s and Pro&s;ing in Conver&s;ation, is an abominable practice, I allow; but no man ever dealt half &s;o di&s;agreeably in that figure of rheto|rick, which, I think, Swift calls the <HI>Circumbendibus,</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="212">
as the fops and flirts of the pre&s;ent age now deal in the abrupt, &s;nip-&s;nap manner of abandoning a &s;ubject before three &s;yllables have been &s;aid upon it; flying from one que&s;tion to another, as if each had been &s;tarted for the &s;ake of quitting it immediately, or as if the very gho&s;t of good &s;en&s;e was to be laid in all good company. Conver&s;ation was in|tended as a kind of traffick of mental commo|dities, but nobody now dare open their budget: and le&s;t nature &s;hould &s;et &s;ome tongues a going, the puppies of the world have, from time to time, contrived to put a kind of gag in our mouths, by inventing certain terms calculated to turn every man to ridicule, who will venture to deliver his &s;entiments, or di&s;clo&s;e his mind for the information or entertainment of the company. If you at|tempt to tell a &s;tory, one puppy puts his hand to his cheek, and cries <HI>Patch!</HI> implying, it &s;eems, that the tale is old, and &s;mells of <HI>Joe Miller</HI>; and if you continue your narration a minute and half, another puppy turns to a monkey next him, and whi&s;pers <Q REND="inline">"what a <HI>bore!</HI> or <HI>boar!</HI>"</Q> for I don't know how they &s;pell their non&s;en&s;e; but (take it which way you will) it is intended to convey an idea of tediou&s;ne&s;s, and to compare the &s;peaker to a hog or a gimlet: but &s;ure, Sir, &s;uch wretches are
<PB N="190" REF="213">
them&s;elves the greate&s;t enemies to good company; mere dampers to the mind, wet blankets to the imagination, and extingui&s;hers of good &s;en&s;e and good humour. Taciturnity is the great vice of Engli&s;hmen, and it would be more expedient to devi&s;e methods to prevail on them to throw off that re&s;erve that freezes their conver&s;ation, than to &s;tudy the&s;e poor meagre inventions to &s;hut up every man's light, like a dark lanthorn, within his own bo&s;om. A bold free &s;pirit, it is true, will leap the&s;e fences; but it is hard, methinks, that a plain mode&s;t man &s;hould be &s;topt in the high road of conver&s;ation, and not &s;uffered to go on without interruption.</P>
<P>I love humour and plea&s;antry, Sir, as well as the merrie&s;t man in the kingdom; but give me leave to inform the&s;e fine gentlemen, that it is a me|lancholy &s;ymptom, when they cannot bear the &s;e|rious pur&s;uit of any &s;ubject for two minutes to|gether. Humour it&s;elf, if good for any thing, is &s;erious at the bottom; but what provokes me, is, that the&s;e cuckows are as grave as &s;toicks, and hold it a kind of trea&s;on to laugh; for the old folly is revived, which almo&s;t began to grow ob&s;olete in our ancient comedies, of being <HI>gentleman-like and melancholy.</HI> Conver&s;ation being a kind of
<PB N="191" REF="214">
&s;hort extempore compo&s;ition, all &s;evere cen&s;ure of what falls from us, prophanene&s;s and indecency excepted, is ridiculous: not only &s;en&s;e, but for the &s;ake of &s;en&s;e, even non&s;en&s;e, &s;hould be to|lerated; for a man who is always afraid of uttering what may be interpreted to be non&s;en&s;e, will not give his under&s;tanding fair play; and he will often let the immediate occa&s;ion, that would have given grace and force to his ob&s;ervations, pa&s;s by. He will &s;eem, like an aukward militia-man, di&s;charging his &s;olitary blunderbu&s;s, long after the re&s;t of the corps; or at be&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing his words to have real weight and &s;terling value, they will come upon us untowardly, like di&s;tant thunder, which does not reach our ears, till long after the fla&s;h has taught us to expect it.</P>
<P>By attending and ob&s;erving Modern Conver&s;ation, one would be tempted to imagine that it was one of the fir&s;t principles of politene&s;s, to drive all &s;en|timent and &s;cience out of &s;ociety. Every thing re|lative to a man's peculiar concerns, in which he might &s;uppo&s;e his friends and acquaintance to take &s;ome little intere&s;t, is deemed impertinent; and every thing relative to knowledge is deemed pedantick. Formerly the hone&s;t bottle forced &s;ome rational and &s;pirited &s;allies, even from the
<PB N="192" REF="215">
mo&s;t riotous company; but the milk&s;ops of our age keep them&s;elves &s;ober, till the cards or dice re|lieve them from the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of endeavouring to amu&s;e each other by Conver&s;ation. In the mean time, to put a curb on the fancy, le&s;t the little ge|nius they have &s;hould grow re&s;tive, and run away with them, they devi&s;e the&s;e mi&s;erable mecha|nical pieces of ridicule, as re&s;traints on the freedom of &s;ociety. I am rather an old fellow, perhaps &s;omewhat peevi&s;h, and I confe&s;s it often puts me quite out of patience; when a man cries <HI>Patch!</HI> at one of my &s;tories, I am almo&s;t provoked to give him a &s;lap on the face; and when a puppy &s;eems to mea&s;ure my words with a &s;top watch, and at the end of a few &s;econds cries, <HI>Bore!</HI> I am almo&s;t ready to call him out for his rudene&s;s and im|pertinence.</P>
<P>We have lo&s;t the noble art of antiquity of writing elegant compo&s;itions in the form of Dia|logue. No wonder: for what dialogue can ap|pear natural, when &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from the mouths of men who will di&s;cour&s;e on no &s;ubject, who preclude all plea&s;antries, as vulgar, and &s;u|per&s;ede all knowledge as pedantick? As to &s;en|timent, it might find as much quarter in a modern comedy from a modern critick, as from our puny
<PB N="193" REF="216">
e&s;tabli&s;hers of the laws of Conver&s;ation. The heart and the head are equally unconcerned, and to &s;eem to know any thing, or to feel any thing, are alike breaches of politene&s;s. But &s;urely, Sir, all this is directly oppo&s;ite to the warmth and plainne&s;s of our old national character: we were wont, like Shake&s;peare's Claudio, to &s;peak home and to the purpo&s;e. If a man's mind is full of ideas, why not let them run over, and water the barren under&s;tandings, or refre&s;h the fruitful wits, of the company? And indeed, a man him&s;elf &s;carce knows what &s;tuff he has in his thoughts, till he has drawn them out into di&s;cour&s;e, and often forms his own opinion according to the impre&s;&s;ions that his words &s;eem to make on his hearers. An&s;wers too are produced, frequently given with more &s;hrewdne&s;s on the &s;pot, than on further con|&s;ideration; and truth, as well as wit, is &s;truck out by colli&s;ion. I don't mean to con&s;ider every company as a tinder-box, and to &s;et argument and repartee, like flint and &s;teel, perpetually &s;triking again&s;t each other; yet if a &s;park is now and then lighted up, why &s;hould the officious hand of dulne&s;s be autho|rized, by &s;uppo&s;ed politene&s;s, to extingui&s;h it? Conver&s;ation is mentioned by Lord Bacon, (as wi&s;e a man, Sir, as the wi&s;e&s;t of our <HI>macaronies,</HI>)
<PB N="194" REF="217">
among the chief benefits of friend&s;hip, <Q REND="inline">"making day-light in the under&s;tanding, out of darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion of thoughts;"</Q> and as you adorned your la&s;t paper by an extract from a learned Modern, give me leave to wind up the bottom of my loo&s;e thoughts on <HI>Conver&s;ation,</HI> with a pa&s;&s;age tran&s;cribed from that great Chancellor and Philo&s;opher.</P>
<Q>Whoever hath his mind fraught with many thoughts, his wit and under&s;tanding do clarifie and break up in the communicating and di&s;cour&s;ing with another; he to&s;&s;eth his thoughts more ea&s;ily, he mar&s;halleth them more orderly, he &s;eeth how they look when they are turned into words: finally, he waxeth wi&s;er than him&s;elf, and that more by an hour's di&s;cour&s;e, than by a day's meditation. It was well &s;aid by Themi&s;tocles to the King of Per&s;ia, <HI>That &s;peech was like cloth of Arras, opened and put abroad; whereby the imagery doth appear in figure, whereas in thought they lie but as in packs.</HI> Neither is the fruit of friend&s;hip, of opening the under&s;tanding, re&s;trained only to &s;uch friends as are able to give a man coun&s;el; (they indeed are be&s;t) but even without that a man learneth of him&s;elf, and bringeth his own thoughts to light, and whetteth his wits as again&s;t a &s;tone, which it&s;elf cuts not. In a word, a man were better relate
<PB N="195" REF="218">
him&s;elf to a &s;tatue or picture, than to &s;uffer his thoughts to pa&s;s in &s;mother.</Q>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Conference, &s;ays Lord Coke al&s;o, is the life of &s;tudy: Conference, &s;ays Lord Bacon again, makes a ready man, and if he confer little, he had need have a pre&s;ent wit."&mdash;</Q>In &s;hort, Sir, Con|ver&s;ation is the great &s;ource of plea&s;ure and infor|mation in &s;ociety, and whoever contributes to dam it up, &s;hould be &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the re&s;t of mankind. But to &s;uffer a bye word, a low cant term, to deprive us of the means of entertainment and intelligence, is the meane&s;t pu&s;illanimity, and &s;acrificing good &s;en&s;e at the &s;hrine of folly and non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave, therefore, by an <HI>index expur|gatorius,</HI> to bani&s;h <HI>Patch</HI> and <HI>Bore</HI> from the modern vocabulary; not merely on account of the barbarity of the terms, but for the evil tendency of the ridiculous &s;omething, or le&s;s than nothing, im|plied by them; for they are not only framed by blockheads de&s;titute of meaning in them&s;elves, but calculated to kill the &s;eeds of good &s;en&s;e and hu|manity in other people.

<P>THOUGH I did not on the commencement of this undertaking engage to appear before the Publick at any certain &s;tated periods, yet it might not unrea&s;onably be pre&s;umed by the occa|&s;ional reader, that I &s;hould at lea&s;t adhere in &s;ome degree to the u&s;ual practice of an Occa&s;ional Writer. In the &s;mall circle of tho&s;e, who did me the honour to peru&s;e the foregoing numbers, my long &s;ilence has, I find, given ri&s;e to various conjectures. Some
<PB N="197" REF="220">
have not &s;crupled to pronounce me really <HI>&amp; bon&acirc; fide</HI> decea&s;ed; while others have contented them|&s;elves with lamenting my metaphorical departure from the literary world, &s;aying, that my &s;mall kilderkin of wit was entirely exhau&s;ted. Others again have a&s;&s;erted, that during the &s;ummer months, I was, like my betters, retired into the country. Many concurring in this opinion, have however attributed my &s;ilence to &s;ome accident attending my retirement or peregrinations. Some have repre|&s;ented me on hor&s;eback, like the Taylor riding to Brentford, and have cruelly di&s;located my collar|bone by a fall; &s;ome have &s;hot me with a &s;pring|gun, or &s;tuck me in a man-trap, like Gulliver in a marrowbone; &s;ome have ca&s;t me away on an inland-navigation; and &s;ome have buried me alive in a cavern of the Peak.</P>
<P>I have now the plea&s;ure to inform my friends that I am alive, and hope they will find me alive and merry. The truth is, I have been in the country; and though I cannot, like the inimitable Spectator, indulge my&s;elf in a &s;eries of rural lucubrations; though I cannot extract entertainment from the hi&s;tory of an henroo&s;t, or pen an agreeable di&s;&s;er|tation upon haycocks; yet before I meet the Par|liament in London, and &s;et up my re&s;t in town for
<PB N="198" REF="221">
the winter, I will give a &s;hort account of my fir&s;t vi&s;it during the &s;ummer rece&s;s. This publication however is not without the privity and good liking of mine ho&s;t. Let me not be blamed therefore for a breach of the laws of ho&s;pitality!</P>
<P>My old &s;choolfellow and college acquaintance, Sir Jocelyn Hearty, having long importuned me to pa&s;s two or three weeks with him in the country, about the beginning of Augu&s;t I &s;et out for his &s;eat, and towards the conclu&s;ion of the &s;econd day, found my&s;elf nearly at the end of my journey. Within two or three miles of the man&s;ion-hou&s;e, I encountered &s;everal hor&s;e-men who&s;e &s;eat appeared uncommonly loo&s;e and un&s;teady; &s;ome in &s;mall parties, hanging over their hor&s;es, and &s;eeming in earne&s;t conver&s;ation with each other; &s;ome galloping furiou&s;ly after, dropping whips, and hats, and wigs, by the way, and &s;houting as they pa&s;t, to denote their good fellow&s;hip, and hail their acquaintance. Upon turning into the grounds, which lead directly to the hou&s;e, my ears were &s;a|luted with a loud vocal chorus, which however quickly &s;ub&s;ided, but was almo&s;t as quickly re|newed, and thus ro&s;e and fell by turns, till I was arrived at the gate. Entering the hall, I found it &s;trewed with hone&s;t ru&s;ticks, fa&s;t a&s;leep, in their
<PB N="199" REF="222">
boots and great coats. A &s;aloon on each &s;ide of the hall was filled with benches and long ta|bles, at which a jovial company &s;till kept their places, drinking, toa&s;ting, and &s;inging.</P>
<P>My friend, it &s;eems, was already retired. An old &s;ervant, however, took me under his protection, and provided me with every nece&s;&s;ary accommo|dation till the next morning. About noon I was introduced to Sir Jocelyn, whom I found in his dre&s;&s;ing-room, with a bowl before him, containing a compo&s;ition of milk, nutmeg, and brandy, which he called <HI>a Doctor.</HI> This Doctor is, it &s;eems, always called in on the morrow of the&s;e joyous fe&s;|tivities, and though not regular, may boa&s;t as numerous a &s;et of patients, and a practice as ex|ten&s;ive, as any of the Faculty. After a hearty &s;hake by the hand, and a few other civilities, the Baronet informed me, that he and his friends of ye&s;terday had been getting drunk <HI>according to act of parliament.</HI> Having formerly been a &s;tudent of the law, I expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e at not being able to recollect &s;o particular a chapter in the &s;tatute book. <Q REND="inline">"It is one of the be&s;t of them all, for all that, &s;aid Sir Jocelyn: and yet it is but a new law neither, and I had the honour to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the pa&s;&s;ing it. The <HI>Grenville</HI> Bill, my friend!
<PB N="200" REF="223">
Since that Bill pa&s;t into a law, we dare not give a gill of wine, or a tiff of punch, before the election; but it is fit we &s;hould entertain our friends hand&s;omely &s;ome time after it is over, that the freeholders may &s;ee we do not forget them, and remember us hereafter accordingly."</Q> I could not help &s;miling at &s;o ingenious an expo&s;i|tion of the &s;tatute, telling my friend that the &s;oundne&s;s of his law put me in mind of Foigard's logick, <Q REND="inline">"if you receive it before-hand it is a bribe; but if you take it afterwards, is is only a grati|fication."</Q></P>
<P>A few days after, Sir Jocelyn told me, if it was a matter of indifference to me which way I might ride that morning, he &s;hould be very glad of my company to a village at about eight miles di&s;tance. <Q REND="inline">"But I mu&s;t quit you at the town's end, &s;ays he, for I am engaged to dinner, and on particular bu&s;ine&s;s. We have a Meeting of the Ju&s;tices."</Q> The chief bu&s;ine&s;s of this meeting, it &s;eems, was to &s;ign Licences for the Publick Hou&s;es for the year en&s;uing. This bu&s;ine&s;s was fortunately di&s;|patched before dinner; fortunately, I &s;ay, be|cau&s;e their Wor&s;hips &s;hewed them&s;elves &s;o &s;incerely well inclined to promote the intere&s;t of tho&s;e, who&s;e callings they met to authori&s;e, that it
<PB N="201" REF="224">
would not have been prudent to po&s;tpone an opera|tion for which their very zeal might di&s;qualify them. In &s;hort, after a joyous day, Sir Jocelyn rode home rather quicker than he went, and we &s;aw no more of him till the next morning.</P>
<P>In about a week more however he was again called forth to a Turnpike Meeting. Sir Jocelyn, ever ready to accommodate his friends, and &s;erve the Publick, duly attended; but the road under con&s;ideration proved &s;o execrable, and &s;o many difficulties occurred concerning the propo&s;als for repairing it, that the Committee &s;at till midnight, and did not ri&s;e till they had debated the matter, like the antient Germans, both drunk and &s;ober.</P>
<P>The Races and the A&s;&s;izes, being each a kind of a&s;&s;embly of the whole county, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Baronet and his family to be ab&s;ent from either. On two different days of the Races were entered two hor&s;es belonging to Sir Jocelyn. Both &s;tarted, but their fortune was as various as their colours. The fir&s;t day, his bald-faced grey hor&s;e, North, won the odds again&s;t the field, carried off the King's Plate, and was victorious; but on the &s;econd day his brown hor&s;e, Orator, took ru&s;t, ran out of the cour&s;e, and was di&s;tanced. Sir Jocelyn and his friends, after the example of the Ancients, celebrated
<PB N="202" REF="225">
one of the&s;e events, and lamented the other, exactly in the &s;ame manner. The flowing bowls were crowned again and again in honour of the winner, and the cup of affliction ran over in &s;orrow for the lo&s;er.</P>
<P>At the A&s;&s;izes, Sir Jocelyn was Foreman of the Grand Jury. So many bills were pre&s;ented, that the &s;everal members of the Inque&s;t, exhau&s;ted by their uncommon fatigue, required a more than or|dinary recruit. It is no wonder therefore that, having duly di&s;patched in &s;ober &s;adne&s;s the bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation, the hone&s;t country gentlemen relaxed their gravity, and converting their &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly to a merry meeting, protracted their &s;itting after &s;upper till daylight.</P>
<P>An old boon companion of my acquaintance u&s;ed to &s;ay, that getting tip&s;y was one of the plea&s;ante&s;t things in the world, but that nothing was &s;o irk&s;ome and painful than its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, getting &s;ober again. This was exactly the ca&s;e with Sir Jocelyn. The text of every evening was mirth and jollity, but the comment of the mor|row-morning was &s;orrow and &s;ickne&s;s. The hunting &s;ea&s;on commenced &s;ome little time before I departed. Every hare or fox that had been killed in the morning, was revived at night, and again
<PB N="203" REF="226">
run down in full cry. The exerci&s;e of the cha&s;e was le&s;s laborious than the fe&s;tivity of the evening. Politicks took their turn al&s;o. America was floated with lakes of claret, and the blockade of Bo&s;ton cau&s;ed many an head-ach. On one of the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions, &s;eeing my worthy friend in much pain, I could not refrain from a &s;hort and affectionate ex|po&s;tulation, regretting that an excellent under|&s;tanding &s;hould be drowned in liquor, and the be&s;t of men rendered a martyr to his own ho&s;pi|tality and benevolence. <Q REND="inline">"Ah, my dear friend, &s;aid Sir Jocelyn, with his hand pre&s;&s;ed upon his temples, you Town Gentlemen imagine that we lead very quiet, idle, lives in the Country: but take my word for it, that it requires a very good e&s;tate, and a very good con&s;titution, to &s;upport, as one ought to do, the character of a Country Gentleman."</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE you have announced your arrival in town, I hope you intend to demon&s;trate by &s;ome future papers, that you are a frequenter of the Theatre. I love the Playhou&s;e, and am one of tho&s;e plain folks that dine early enough to attend the ri&s;ing of the curtain. I do not &s;it down to table at &s;ix, prolong the la&s;t cour&s;e till eight or nine, and then perhaps crack my head with cracking a bottle, or rattling a dice-box, till eight or nine the next morning. I hope therefore, &s;ince with the
<PB N="205" REF="228">
bulk of my countrymen, I take an intere&s;t in the&s;e entertainments, that you will, like your predece&s;&s;or-e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts, gratify us with &s;ome &s;ound critici&s;ms on the Drama: &s;ound critici&s;ms, I &s;ay; no flim&s;y pa|negyrick, or gro&s;s abu&s;e, prai&s;ing or reviling one writer or performer for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing or deba&s;ing another; but tracing and enforcing the real principles of the Drama; and if examples, for the &s;ake of illu&s;tration, mu&s;t now and then be given, give them from the Cla&s;&s;ick Dead! for prai&s;e or cen&s;ure of the Living is commonly nau&s;eous, com|monly &s;u&s;picious. The Dead too (no offence to the pre&s;ent generation!) are our more intimate ac|quaintance.</P>
<P>I do not mean however to depreciate the talents of the Living. No Sir, you will find that the main &s;cope of this letter is to encourage cotemporary merit, and to repre&s;s the petulance, and expo&s;e the futility, of common-place critici&s;m. Writers, who endeavour to effect their purpo&s;e by methods merely mechanical, are ju&s;tly denied the Palm of Genius. Ought Criticks then to comment by line and rule, and to decide by a receipt? If Critici&s;m be the handmaid of the Mu&s;e, &s;he might &s;urely catch &s;omething of her air and &s;pirit, rather than rip up the ca&s;t cloaths of her mi&s;tre&s;s, at once to
<PB N="206" REF="229">
&s;teal the pattern, and find fault with the fa&s;hion. In a word, her labours &s;hould be directed to pro|mote the arts, rather than to di&s;hearten the pro|fe&s;&s;ors; and though it mu&s;t naturally fall out that more can &s;ee and read than tho&s;e who write, and paint, &amp;c. yet &s;ince they who hazard their ob&s;er|vations in publick, in &s;ome mea&s;ure become arti&s;ts them&s;elves, they &s;hould take care to found tho&s;e ob&s;ervations on the ba&s;is of candour, ta&s;te, and good &s;en&s;e. At pre&s;ent the pre&s;s &s;warms with Criticks. A lou&s;e, &s;ay the naturali&s;ts, is a very lou&s;y animal; and there is not a lou&s;y author in town, e&s;pecially a Dramatick Author, that has not fifty lou&s;y Criticks on his back. The&s;e blood-&s;uckers have no doubt their u&s;e, and may &s;erve to correct the too &s;anguine imagination of an author: But I beg leave to mention a few in&s;tances, wherein I think they contribute to weaken and to impoveri&s;h genius.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t canon of Modern Critici&s;m (and indeed it has been a favourite topick ever &s;ince the Flood) is the degeneracy of the pre&s;ent age. This is the grand aera of Dulne&s;s: Genius, they cry, is extinct. Shake&s;peare, Jon&s;on, and Fletcher; Wycherly, Congreve, and Vanbrugh, are no more!&mdash;True; and the pre&s;ent writers, &s;uch as they are,
<PB N="207" REF="230">
will hereafter at lea&s;t have that claim to applau&s;e. They will be no more.&mdash;But a good Play, &s;ay the Criticks, is &s;o &s;carce, &s;o very &s;carce a commodity!&mdash;Granted. When was it otherwi&s;e? Allowing for a moment, that every old piece in Dod&s;ley's Collection is excellent, how few are &s;uch pieces to tho&s;e which were then written and exhibited, who&s;e wit and &s;pirit has not been &s;ufficient to keep them &s;weet, and alive, for the delight and entertainment of the pre&s;ent generation! From the days of Ae&s;chylus to ye&s;terday, few writers have been equal to the hard ta&s;k of a good Tragedy; to write a Comedy is a &s;erious matter; and even an excellent Farce|monger (&s;ays Diderot) is no ordinary character. I have looked upon the Stage for a long, long &s;eries of time, and without flattery to the pre&s;ent race of Dramati&s;ts, I will venture to pronounce that the la&s;t five and twenty years, or thereabouts, have produced more plays likely to de&s;cend to po&s;terity, than the five and twenty immediately preceding. I do not mean to pay my court to any particular author; I have thrown the compliment among them, and let each of them take as much of it as he may think falls to his &s;hare.</P>
<P>To point out antique merit to the Moderns, as an object of emulation, is wi&s;e and laudable; but
<PB N="208" REF="231">
to &s;et it up, like the gallows, to terrify and gibbet poor culprits, that venture on the high road of letters, is impolitick and ungenerous. Compari|&s;ons are commonly invidious, yet there are a kind of compari&s;ons &s;till more odious than tho&s;e between the Antients and Moderns&mdash;I mean tho&s;e drawn between Moderns and Moderns. Wits, as well as Beauties, are naturally fond of pulling caps, and mangling the reputations of each other. But &s;hall the &s;ober Critick, who ought to keep down their vanity, and quell their arrogance, &s;hall <HI>He,</HI> as it were <HI>ex cathedr&acirc;,</HI> give a &s;anction to their &s;quabbles, or throw additional weight into that &s;cale, which &s;ucce&s;s and &s;elf-conceit have perhaps already made too heavy? Let every &s;ucce&s;sful writer triumph in his turn, yet do not chain his fellow-authors to the wheels of his chariot; but rather let it be the office of a Critick, like the &s;lave of the Antients, to bid him remember that he is mortal.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t offen&s;ive weapon of Modern Cri|tici&s;m is &s;ome <HI>reigning word,</HI> with which every literary Rifleman arms him&s;elf, and does dreadful execution. The two leading mono&s;yllables of the Hou&s;e of Commons are not more powerful than &s;uch <HI>a word,</HI> be it what it may, while it remains
<PB N="209" REF="232">
formidable by being in fa&s;hion. I am old enough to remember when the word Low was this Scare-crow. <HI>Genteel</HI> Comedy, and the <HI>polite&s;t</HI> Literature, were in univer&s;al reque&s;t; and every writer who attempted to be <HI>comick,</HI> dreaded the imputation of buffoonery. If a piece had &s;trong humour&mdash;Oh, Sir, it's damned <HI>low!</HI>&mdash;was its &s;entence of condemnation. At length, how|ever, the word Low has been re&s;tored to favour, and the term SENTIMENT in its turn has fallen into di&s;grace. <Q REND="inline">"To anatomi&s;e a character, and &s;ee what breeds about the heart,"</Q> had formerly its merit; but now this di&s;&s;ection of the human mind has lo&s;t its advocates and admirers: <HI>Senti|mental &s;tuff</HI> is the phra&s;e; and he who dares to approve a &s;cene, where the cour&s;e of the &s;tory ap|parently leads the author to exhibit Pa&s;&s;ion rather than Humour, is condemned for an old-fa&s;hioned dunce and a coxcomb. Gro&s;s drolleries, or dull moralities, (<HI>moralities</HI> let me call them!) are equally reprehen&s;ible: but Humour is not to be cen&s;ured merely becau&s;e it is <HI>low,</HI> nor <HI>&s;entiment</HI> to be bani&s;hed when it &s;eems to exhibit the workings of the heart. With the Ancient Criticks, the <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Sentiments,</HI> held an equal rank in the
<PB N="210" REF="233">
Drama: each alike excellent, while they were each alike <HI>characteri&s;tick.</HI></P>
<P>After &s;uch a free cen&s;ure of the modern coinage of cant terms in the Critical Vocabulary, if I might be allowed to give currency to a word, I would endeavour to renew one, that is as old as the creation&mdash;NATURE!&mdash;the &s;terling bullion of NATURE!&mdash;Let the Criticks cea&s;e to enquire whether the Humour be <HI>low,</HI> or the piece <HI>&s;entimental</HI>; let them examine whether it be <HI>natural!</HI> But let the admirer and imitator of Nature al&s;o be on his guard, not to fall into in&s;ipidity, or to indulge the minute touches of a Dutch pencil. Let your outline be bold, tho' &s;imple; and fill it as richly, and colour it as highly, as you plea&s;e; always taking care to avoid <HI>extravaganza,</HI> and <Q REND="inline">"to hold, as it were, the Mirror up to <HI>Nature!</HI>"</Q> This is no curb upon the imagination. Caliban is as na|tural as Hamlet.</P>
<P>Compo&s;ition and Critici&s;m are &s;o nearly allied, that in making &s;trictures upon one I have been be|trayed almo&s;t unawares into &s;peaking of the other. Narrowne&s;s in each, <HI>manneri&s;ts</HI> in writing and <HI>manneri&s;ts</HI> in critici&s;m, are equally my aver&s;ion. The wretched fellow, that could paint nothing but a ro&s;e, was not in my opinion more contemptible,
<PB N="211" REF="234">
than the cuckow who can repeat nothing but <HI>low</HI> or <HI>&s;entimental.</HI> The wide field of <HI>Nature</HI> gives &s;cope for that <HI>variety,</HI> which ever di&s;tingui&s;hes an aera of genius. Never was there a period, wherein excellent authors flouri&s;hed, but their &s;everal manners were as different as their faces; nay, a good author po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a ver&s;atility of talent, not only keeping him above the &s;ervile imitation of others, but enabling him in great mea&s;ure to vary from him&s;elf. Yet there is another vice of Criticks, which I forgot to mention before. I mean their perpetually recurring to every writer's fir&s;t pro|duction, and &s;ettling it as the &s;tandard of his genius, as if they dreaded his cultivating more than one &s;pot of Parna&s;&s;us. To compare a man with him&s;elf, di&s;advantageou&s;ly too, is of all compa|ri&s;ons the mo&s;t mortifying: but mortification is no more the main bu&s;ine&s;s of the Critick, than torture &s;hould be the &s;tudy of the Surgeon, tho' &s;ome pain will of nece&s;&s;ity follow both their operations.</P>
<P>To conclude, Sir, while I recommend the Drama to your notice, I mean to warn you from falling into the vulgar errors of ordinary commentators. And I hope you will take warning. But if you go on, gingling the bells of Panegyrick, or wading through the mire of Abu&s;e, in the beaten track of
<PB N="212" REF="235">
Modern Critici&s;m, I wi&s;h that your remarks may peri&s;h, as &s;peedily as the lie of the day, with which they appear; and that your E&s;&s;ays may be con&s;igned to oblivion, with the News-papers in which they are printed.</P>
<P>In hopes of better things from your candour and di&s;cernment, I remain your old friend, and old corre&s;pondent,</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>&rindx; The following Letter, though written by another hand, and without the privity of <HI>TERRAE-FILIUS,</HI> is yet prefixt to his papers now repub|li&s;hed, as an Introduction, or &s;hort Preface, conveying a ju&s;t idea of the De&s;ign of the Author, and the Nature of the Undertaking.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>To the PRINTER of the ST. JAMES's CHRONICLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the TERRAE-FILIUS is to be reviv'd at the ENCAENIA now held at Oxford, the follow|ing explanation of that character may be agreeable to &s;ome of your readers.</P>
<P>TERRAE-FILIUS is a &s;tudent who writes a &s;atyr upon the members of the Univer&s;ity during the Fe&s;tival, and taxes them with any <HI>faux pas,</HI> or irre|gularities, they may have committed; a &s;ort of a licen&s;ed Pa&s;quin for the time. He takes his title from the old Roman phra&s;e TERRAE-FILIUS, which among them &s;ignified an ob&s;cure or unknown per|&s;on; it neither being proper nor advi&s;eable that the author of the cen&s;ures u&s;ually thrown out under this character &s;hould be publickly known. It is confidently reported, the celebrated Mr. C. C--ll is gone down to a&s;&s;i&s;t therein.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="238">As the word ENCAENIA al&s;o may probably puzzle the unlettered part of your readers, it will not be ami&s;s to inform them, that it &s;ignifies an ANNIVERSARY FEAST, held by the Primitive Chri&s;tians in comme|moration of the day on which their Churches were founded, and &s;ince u&s;ed to denote any Annual Fe&s;tival. The money out of which the expences of the pre&s;ent ENCAENIA at Oxford are to be defrayed, was origi|nally left, if I mi&s;take not, to New College, by their generous benefactor Lord Crew, and was for|merly laid out in what is called a GAUDY, from the Latin word <HI>Gaudeo,</HI> to rejoice, that is to &s;ay, <HI>&s;pent in eating and drinking.</HI> But for the&s;e thirteen years pa&s;t, the College, with a di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s which does them the highe&s;t Honour, have be&s;towed the Legacy on the Univer&s;ity, to be by them laid out in defraying the expences of an Annual Mu&s;ical Entertainment, or &s;uch other <HI>Celebrity</HI> as &s;hall be likely to render the Univer&s;ity famous, and increa&s;e the number of its Patrons, by drawing a concour&s;e of Gentry and Nobility there, who are always complimented on the&s;e occa&s;ions with Academical Honours &s;uitable to their Rank. The Fe&s;tivities of this year derive additional lu&s;tre from the In&s;tallation of their Chancellor, the Right Hon. the Earl of Litchfield.</P>

<P>TO all whom it may concern, I the great TERRAE-FILIUS, the redoubted Acade|mical Satyri&s;t, the terror of old and young, male and female, graduates and undergraduates, gown&s;|men and town&s;men, matriculated and unmatri|culated, &s;end greeting. I am come, Ladies and
<PB N="218" REF="240">
Gentlemen, according to ancient cu&s;tom, to be one of the principal Actors in the Celebrities of the pre&s;ent Term. You have heard, without doubt, of the noble exploits of my predece&s;&s;ors, tho&s;e bold a&s;&s;ertors of the Freedom of Speech, and the Li|berty of the Pre&s;s. Though the degeneracy of the times, and the numberle&s;s innovations in the ancient cu&s;toms and u&s;ages of the Univer&s;ity will not permit me, after the manner of my ance&s;tors, to enter the Theatre, and pour forth the torrent of my Family Eloquence from the Ro&s;trum, yet I am re&s;olved, not to be put to &s;ilence. <HI>My wi&s;dom &s;hall cry aloud in the &s;treets, though no man re|gardeth it.</HI> I will erect my temporary Stage, like the itinerant practitioners in phy&s;ick, in the high|way; I will <HI>make a &s;peech without doors.</HI> If I am forbid to mount the regular Pulpit, I do not doubt of having as numerous followers as other Field-Preachers. I am determined, at all events, to maintain the Honour, and a&s;&s;ert the Privileges of my family; and make no doubt of being able to prove my&s;elf a Chip of the Old Block.</P>
<P>The method I have taken of announcing my intentions, by Adverti&s;ements in the London Papers, and Oxford Journal has, I find, created the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation among all ranks and
<PB N="219" REF="241">
degrees of people in this famous Town and Univer&s;ity. The Mayor and Corporation, I am informed were fir&s;t &s;ei&s;ed with the pannick fit, and held a council extraordinary on this occa&s;ion; when it was taken into con&s;ideration, whether they &s;hould put me into the Stocks, &s;end me to the Hou&s;e of Correction, or bind me over to appear at the next Quarter Se&s;&s;ions. At length how|ever it was held to be an Univer&s;ity-Bu&s;ine&s;s, and to fall more properly under the cogni&s;ance of the Hou&s;e of Convocation. From the Body Corporate therefore my cau&s;e was removed, by a new kind of <HI>Certiorari,</HI> to the Body Academical. The Right Honourable the Chancellor, I am told, is alarmed, and thinks of i&s;&s;uing a formal prohibition. The Learned and Reverend the Vice-Chancellor, I hear, has declared that he will not grant his <HI>Imprimatur</HI> to my Works: and the wi&s;e heads in Golgotha have laid their Sculls together about me and my paper. That formidable lawyer, and learned gentleman, the VENERIAN Profe&s;&s;or, it is confi|dently a&s;&s;erted, is con&s;ulting the Archives, to pre|pare a SOLEMN LECTURE on the two tremendous Statutes <HI>De Contumeliis Compe&s;cendis,</HI> and <HI>De Famo&s;is Libellis.</HI> The Publick Orator, they &s;ay, is drawing up an Harangue in the &s;tyle and &s;pirit of <HI>Quou&s;que</HI>
<PB N="220" REF="242">
<HI>tandem?</HI> and the Poetry Profe&s;&s;or is writing a Poem again&s;t me. It is further added, that the name of TERRAE-FILIUS him&s;elf, as &s;oon as it is certainly known, will be regi&s;tered in the BLACK BOOK; and he him&s;elf, like mo&s;t of his fore-fathers, will be publickly expelled:&mdash;That his poor printer will be trained after a Beadle, as big as Pope Beaver, into the Vice-Chancellor's Court, and in &s;pite of the Statute <HI>De Privilegiis Urbis et Univer|&s;itatis &s;imul non fruendis,</HI> have the honour of an Academical <HI>Mittimus</HI> to the Ca&s;tle or <HI>Bocardo.</HI></P>
<P>Some few, however, who fancy that they &s;ee deeper than the &s;urface, and that they have more penetration than their neighbours, affect to know me and my intentions better. The dreadful &s;ound of the name I have a&s;&s;umed, which has alarmed the vulgar, as that of <HI>Raw-head-and-bloody-bones</HI> &s;erves as a bug-bear for children, the&s;e confident gen|tlemen affect to con&s;ider as a mere &s;care-crow &s;et up to fright the few &s;hallow daws and chattering pies of the Univer&s;ity, while my words, however big and &s;onorous, are as innocent as the noi&s;e of a cherry-clapper. They affect to laugh at tho&s;e who have conceived horrible ideas of me, and cry out, when they hear that TERRAE-FILIUS is coming, that <HI>there is a lion in the way.</HI> TERRAE-FILIUS,
<PB N="221" REF="243">
they pretend, is not that tremendous animal he was wont to be. Lion as he is, he has filed his teeth, and pared his claws, and though he may venture to lift up his voice, and make <HI>the wide fore&s;t tremble at his roar,</HI> yet like Shake&s;pear's Lion, he will roar as gently as any nightingale.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, whether I &s;hall prove my&s;elf a Literary Hornet, a downright Academical Wa&s;p, or merely an innocent <HI>Humble-bee,</HI> with a &s;mall &s;ting by way of defence, or <HI>melius non tangere,</HI> in my tail; whether my &s;tyle will be more agreeable to the genius of our modern ENCAENIA, or the old <HI>Saturnalia</HI>; whether I &s;hall pour forth from my &s;mall cruet of wit and humour the oil of Panegyrick, or the vinegar of Invective and Satire; in what|ever manner I may write or &s;peak; &s;till, Gentle|men, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on it, that I have a natural, an uncontrovertible right to appear at the&s;e Solemnities, a right e&s;tabli&s;hed by the ancient forms of the Univer&s;ity, and recogni&s;ed by the Statutes. The celebrities appendant and appurtenant to the <HI>Act-Term,</HI> every man mu&s;t acknowledge, would be imperfect without the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a character as that I have undertaken to &s;u&s;tain; a character as nece&s;&s;ary to enliven the gravity of &s;olemn convo|cations, formal proce&s;&s;ions, long harangues, dull
<PB N="222" REF="244">
di&s;putations, and oratorios <HI>mo&s;t mu&s;ical, mo&s;t me|lancholy,</HI> as the introduction of the Fool among the per&s;onages of the Old Comedy, or that merry gentleman Ma&s;ter Punch among the wooden Kings and Queens at a Puppet-Shew. It is the peculiar nature al&s;o of &s;ea&s;ons of fe&s;tivity, to &s;trike out &s;allies of Wit, and indulge &s;trokes of Satire, which give no more annoyance to the ge|neral merriment, than illuminations and fireworks on a night of rejoicing, though perhaps &s;ome queer old gentleman may be alarmed at the crackers bouncing about his ears, the &s;erpents hi&s;&s;ing at his tail, or a &s;quib whizzing in his periwig.</P>
<P>In an age le&s;s productive of innovations than the pre&s;ent, I &s;hould indeed be &s;urprized that when the Celebration of the Peace has ccca&s;ioned a kind of <HI>Publick Act,</HI> no per&s;on, properly qualified &s;hould be called upon by the Heads of the Univer&s;ity to officiate in the capacity of TERRAE-FILIUS in the Theatre; or at lea&s;t if &s;o e&s;&s;ential a Per&s;onage as TERRAE-FILIUS &s;hould be by our Academical Licen&s;ers and Chamberlains &s;ilenced and forbid to appear on the &s;cene, I am &s;till more &s;urprized that the character of <HI>Publick Orator</HI> al&s;o &s;hould not be wiped out of the <HI>Dramatis Per&s;onae.</HI> His rattling Eloquence and my Sprightline&s;s, (or, if you plea&s;e
<PB N="223" REF="245">
to call it &s;o, <HI>Impertinence</HI>) &s;hould accompany one another as naturally as thunder and lightning. To have all prai&s;e and no &s;atire, all &s;weet and no &s;our, is to make your punch without lemon. The province of Publick Orator, we know by experience, is wholly Panegyrick; that is (the ca&s;e of the pre&s;ent company always excepted) to &s;ay every thing of a man but the truth; whereas the very nature and &s;pirit of my office demands, that al|though the truth &s;hould not be told at all times, yet at this particular &s;ea&s;on, I may tell the truth, the whole truth, and &s;ometimes perhaps, a little more than the truth; and though truth in general is well known to be at the bottom of the well, yet on the&s;e occa&s;ions, it may be pumped up, be the &s;prings ever &s;o foul and muddy, till it runs clear, and dealt out among you by pails and buckets full.</P>
<P>The Reverend Dr. BROWN, a worthy member and Illu&s;trious ornament of a Si&s;ter Univer&s;ity, in a di&s;&s;ertation lately publi&s;hed, wherein he has drawn all the rudiments of politene&s;s from &s;avages, and &s;hewn us that the Tree of Knowledge ori|ginally took root in the &s;oil of ignorance; the learned Doctor, I &s;ay, Gentlemen, has proved almo&s;t to a <HI>logical,</HI> if not a <HI>mathematical</HI> demon|&s;tration, that Satire and Comedy, as well as Ode and Tragedy, owe their birth to the &s;olemnization
<PB N="224" REF="246">
of that elegant Indian celebrity, the <HI>&s;avage Song-Fea&s;t,</HI> where every man had a licence to make free with another, and to throw out je&s;ts and gibes upon his neighbour. Since therefore the Publick Orator ad|heres to his imitation of the great Prototypes of &s;ublime Panegyrick, &s;hall not TERRAE-FILIUS be permitted to follow up the Originals of familiar Sarca&s;m? Shall we, Ladies and Gentlemen, be le&s;s liberal and open-hearted in our mirth than the Cherokees and the Catabaws? Shall we be ex|ceeded in politene&s;s by the Six Nations? And &s;hall the &s;avages on the Ohio and Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi indulge them&s;elves in more truly-cla&s;&s;ical fe&s;tivities, or ele|gant railleries, than the polite &s;cholars on the banks of the I&s;is?</P>
<P>If we de&s;cend to later times, or examine the cu&s;tom of more poli&s;hed ages, we &s;hall find that at all &s;ea&s;ons of fe&s;tivity and rejoicing, peculiar freedoms are allowed; nay that even &s;ome mixture of terror is often introduced, in order, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, to give a higher reli&s;h to the other portions of the Celebrity. The Spani&s;h bull-fea&s;ts, and old Engli&s;h tilts and tournaments are of this nature; or to confine my illu&s;trations entirely within the limits of our own times and nation, and to &s;hew we love a little hor&s;e-radi&s;h with our roa&s;t-beef, what do you think, Gentlemen and Ladies,
<PB N="225" REF="247">
of the Champion at a Coronation? Is not a doughty knight, armed cap-a-pee, prancing in upon a milk white palfrey, by found of trumpet and beat of drum, and throwing his gauntlet in defiance, a mo&s;t tremendous apparition? He makes his entrance too during the peaceful ceremonial of Dinner-time, yet I never heard that he frightened away the &s;tomach of the mo&s;t delicate Lord or Lady, or infu&s;ed terror into any of the wor&s;hipful Aldermen.&mdash;Do not let TERRAE-FILIUS di&s;turb your <HI>Gaudies,</HI> Gentlemen!</P>

<P>OF all the Literary Commodities, which are at pre&s;ent brought to market, there is not one which produces half &s;o large a demand, or &s;uch a quick &s;ale as SCANDAL. Formerly the &s;weet flowers of Poetry, like Myrtle or Orange Trees in Pots, were the chief ornaments of a Book&s;eller's Window, and &s;old as well as Ro&s;es and Hyacinths at Covent-Garden; but now every bud and blo&s;&s;om of Helicon, every fruit and flower of Poetry, every &s;hrub of Parna&s;&s;us is an unprofitable weed, unle&s;s
<PB N="231" REF="253">
it be as bitter as Wormwood, or Coloquintida. Heavy Treati&s;es, Moral Di&s;cour&s;es, and dull Di&s;&s;ertations, were once as greatly in reque&s;t as beef at Leaden-hall; and Religion and Philo&s;ophy were as fixt &s;taple commodities as corn at Bear-Key. Law, in white Calf-&s;kin, while there were any <HI>Students</HI> in the profe&s;&s;ion, &s;old at as high rates in the purlieus of the Temple or Lincoln's Inn, as the Calf it&s;elf in Smithfield; and till the poring over mu&s;ty <HI>Parchments</HI> was exploded in the Inns of Court, the Sheep-&s;kin was almo&s;t as valuable as the Sheep. It was ea&s;y al&s;o for the Manufacturers of Sy&s;tems and Paradoxes to drive a kind of con|traband trade in Dei&s;m, Infidelity, and &s;uch other Hardware; and little Dablers in Ink often made &s;ucce&s;sful crui&s;es in &s;muggling Prophanene&s;s and Bawdry. In a word, every common Pedlar in a Magazine was thought to have &s;ome curious Trinket in his Pack; and the lowe&s;t Hawker was &s;ure to make a dinner on a Bloody Murder, or the King's Speech.</P>
<P>The&s;e times, wherein the great Mart of Letters was in &s;uch a flouri&s;hing &s;ituation, were indeed glorious! but now, to the un&s;peakable detriment of Trading Authors of almo&s;t every denomination, Literary Property is reduced to a very narrow
<PB N="232" REF="254">
compa&s;s; and the riche&s;t <HI>Copyholders</HI> not only groan under the load of heavy Fines and new Impo|&s;itions, but &s;ee their mo&s;t valuable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions peri&s;hing under their hands, or in &s;pite of every fence of Law and Equity, invaded by bold tre&s;|pa&s;&s;ers from Scotland. For many parcels and whole bales of goods they have now no vent. No performance can promi&s;e it&s;elf a great run that is not highly &s;ea&s;oned with <HI>Abu&s;e</HI>; and the nearer a Writer approaches to unque&s;tionable Libel, and the mo&s;t open <HI>Scandalum Magnat&ucirc;m,</HI> the more his Work will be read. If a &s;mart piece of Satire is thought to have occa&s;ioned a duel, though it is doubtful whether the pi&s;tols of the combatants ever were more than upon half-cock, the paper will run off like wild-fire. An information in the King's-Bench, or a vi&s;it from a King's Me&s;&s;enger will carry off a dozen impre&s;&s;ions; and if the Author &s;tands in the Pillory, or is committed to Newgate, or &s;ent to the Tower, the fortune of the Book&s;eller is made for ever.</P>
<P>It is plain therefore, Ladies and Gentlemen, from the&s;e and many other con&s;iderations, which I have duly weighed and deliberated, that SCANDAL is the mo&s;t profitable commodity which a Writer can deal in, being that to which Readers give
<PB N="233" REF="255">
the mo&s;t encouragement. <HI>Scandal-mongers,</HI> like Fi&s;h-mongers, may put what price they plea&s;e on their goods, and be &s;ure to have them all bought off their hands, provided they will take care to &s;upply their cu&s;tomers fre&s;h and fre&s;h. <HI>This therefore is to give Notice,</HI> that I, TERRAE-FILIUS, at the Univer&s;ity-Scandal-Office in Oxford, have determined to open a &s;hop in the High-Street, during the ENCAENIA; and though all will be accounted fi&s;h that comes to my net, yet to avoid creating a glut, which might make my &s;tock too cheap, I &s;hall, like the re&s;t of my <HI>hone&s;t fraternity,</HI> throw away the <HI>&s;mall Fry,</HI> and offer you nothing but the very Prime of the Market; and I can a&s;&s;ure you, Ladies and Gentlemen, that I have &s;e|veral <HI>odd Fi&s;h,</HI> and &s;uch as were never exhibited to &s;ale before, which are ju&s;t <HI>brought to town</HI> BY LAND CARRIAGE.</P>
<P>I have already received, in con&s;equence of my late reque&s;t by publick adverti&s;ement, &s;everal very curious and entertaining anecdotes concerning &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent Per&s;onages attending the pre&s;ent Celebrity, aliens and vi&s;iters, as well as inhabitants and members of Colleges, with many of which, the names of the parties printed at full length, I propo&s;e to oblige my Readers;
<PB N="234" REF="256">
re&s;erving the re&s;t to enrich the two Volumes of my <HI>College Atalantis,</HI> Sub&s;criptions to which pour in a-pace, abundantly more than &s;ufficient to defray the expence of any Pro&s;ecutions which my Papers may incur, or to carry on &s;uch actions as I may think nece&s;&s;ary to maintain, in vindication of the Freedom of the Subject, and the Liberty of the Pre&s;s.</P>
<P>But while I am thus employed in collecting materials for Secret Hi&s;tory, and pu&s;hing as far as po&s;&s;ible my re&s;earches into the characters of others, you, I find, Ladies and Gentlemen, are equally a&s;&s;iduous in your enquiries after Me. It is a well known remark of Addi&s;on, that Readers never entertain a true reli&s;h for a Performance, till they know &s;omething of the Author; as whether he is a fair man, or a black man; a &s;hort, man, or a tall man; a nobleman, or a gentleman, or a trade&s;man, or a highwayman; a divine, a lawyer, or a phy&s;ician; high or low; rich or poor: &s;orry am I to be obliged to call in que&s;tion the ob&s;ervation of &s;o fine a writer, but I mu&s;t beg leave to in&s;i&s;t on it, that till the Book is, by &s;ome means or other,&mdash;by its Whim&s;icalne&s;s, its Scurrility, or no matter what&mdash;become the object of general notice, nobody cares a farthing
<PB N="235" REF="257">
about the Writer. Then, indeed, when the alarm is given, when Merit has made its way, or when Fa&s;hion or Caprice have given the nod of approbation, then the Hue and Cry goes abroad after the Author.&mdash;Who is he? which is he? where is he? what &s;ays he?&mdash;This is, and I'll be judged by Mr. Shandy,&mdash;this is, as the <HI>Laureat</HI> terms it, <HI>the Honeymoon of Wit.</HI>&mdash;Now Lords a&s;k him to dinner; Ladies take him to Ranelagh; and Ma|nagers give him the Freedom of the Theatre. His Name is in every News-paper, and his Face in every Print-&s;hop. If the real Author is not known, a &s;ub&s;titute, as in the ca&s;e of Militia-Men, is appointed to &s;erve in his &s;tead, which the world runs after with as much eagerne&s;s, as Turnus pur&s;ues the airy image of Aeneas, or ra|ther as the Book&s;ellers pur&s;ue the phantom of an Author in the Dunciad.</P>
<P>I had once &s;ome thoughts, in order to gratify the reigning pa&s;&s;ion for Caricature, of having my head cut in wood, and placed at the front of the&s;e papers. At another time I had half formed a re|&s;olution of having my face painted by Haggarty, and hung up as a &s;ign, at the door of my Printer. But finding that <HI>ma&s;ked Balls</HI> are coming into fa&s;hion, I at la&s;t determined to mix among the
<PB N="236" REF="258">
croud in di&s;gui&s;e, with the liberty of other Ma&s;queraders, of attacking every per&s;on in com|pany, in a &s;eigned voice, with the, witty Interro|gation of <HI>Do you know me?</HI></P>
<P>Curio&s;ity, however, is not to be repreft, and there are many that will flatter them&s;elves they &s;ee through the di&s;gui&s;e. They know your walk, your voice, your air, or &s;ome little peculiarity in your manner, or deportment. I have had the honour of being mi&s;taken for &s;everal celebrated per&s;ons already, and every man is convinced that I am one of his old acquaintance. Some take me for that merry <HI>fellow,</HI> the facetious Author of <HI>The Companion to the Guide, and the Guide to the Companion</HI>; that lively &s;park who &s;hewed early dawnings of a Poetical Genius, and &s;oon proved him&s;elf a fine chopping boy, that would do honour to his ALMA MATER, when he &s;ung <HI>the Triumphs of I&s;is:</HI> who not only brings up the rear of <HI>Epicaedia</HI> and <HI>Gratulationes</HI> with uncommon &s;pirit, but can al&s;o de&s;cend from the &s;ublimer exerci&s;es of his Mu&s;e, to celebrate the <HI>Maker of Mutton-Pies,</HI> or compo&s;e <HI>Odes on Grizzle-Wigs:</HI> who, though now a grave Tutor, cannot &s;urely, nay &s;hould not, wholly forget his days of pupilage; and though now
<Q><PB N="237" REF="259">
<L>&mdash;the Days are come</L>
<L>When calm he &s;mokes in Common-Room,</L>
<L>And dines, with Brea&s;t untroubled, under</L>
<L>The Picture of the pious Founder<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Progre&s;s of Di&s;content&mdash;by the Rev. Mr. T. Wharton.</NOTE>,</L></Q>
yet he mu&s;t remember the days when his ALE fir&s;t became a rival to Phillips's CYDER; the days when he frequented Chri&s;t-Church, and &s;pent his evening at Captain Jolly's.</P>
<P>Some there are, who &s;uppo&s;e me to be no other than that grave Antiquarian, that SOUL of AIL SOULS, who obliged the world &s;ome years ago with a di&s;&s;ertation on <HI>the</HI> MALLARD; who has &s;ince appeared in the &s;hape of a Decypherer, and wrote <HI>an Explanation of the.</HI> OXFORD ALMANACK; and about the &s;ame time, like an expert Game&s;ter, played <HI>my</HI> cards mo&s;t notably at a certain Game of ALL FOURS.</P>
<P>Others take me for that Rattle the STUDENT; and others for that Dapperwit the GENIUS; and &s;ome for both the&s;e together who have come down expre&s;ly from London, like the chairmen with their &s;edans; or like a pair of oars on the Thames in Whit&s;on-Holydays, have agreed to ply together, during the pre&s;ent Celebrity on the I&s;is. Should it be the fir&s;t of the&s;e wags, it is

pretended that the company may expect a <HI>Sign Po&s;t Exhibition,</HI> or that the &s;olemn Oratorios under the direction of Dr. Hayes, the Profe&s;&s;or of Mu&s;ick will be turned into ridicule by a <HI>grand Burle&s;que Ode,</HI> and a ma&s;ked Band from Ranelagh: and in ca&s;e it &s;hould be the other <HI>Little Wit,</HI> it is &s;uppo&s;ed that, be&s;ides threatning the Univer&s;ity with a TERRAE-FILIUS, he means once more to convert the Tennis-Court into a Playhou&s;e, and, in defiance of the Statute <HI>De ludis prohi|bitis,</HI> to bring down a company of Comedians <HI>(fu|nambulos et hi&s;triones)</HI> to pre&s;ent us with new JEALOUS WIVES, and new POLLY HONEYCOMBES, of his own compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Some few, who indulge this la&s;t way of thinking, are half inclined to &s;uppo&s;e that TERRAE FILIUS is the Haymarket MOMUS, who formerly <HI>gave Tea,</HI> and <HI>took off</HI> his Tutor and the re&s;t of the Fellows at Worce&s;ter-College; in which honourable So|ciety he is acknowledged to be a <HI>Founder's Kin,</HI> of which circum&s;tance perhaps he may one day or other claim the benefit, notwith&s;tanding the objections rai&s;ed in Dr. Black&s;tone's learned Treati&s;e on <HI>Collateral Con&s;anguinity.</HI></P>
<P>Others again, the mini&s;terial and anti-mini&s;|terial Characters in the Univer&s;ity, who&s;e ideas
<PB N="239" REF="261">
of Wit and Humour are almo&s;t entirely ab&s;orbed in Port and Politicks, will have it that I am one or other of the &s;uppo&s;ed Authors of the <HI>North-Briton</HI>; &s;ince it is generally reported that the <HI>Reverend Gentleman,</HI> having &s;napped the la&s;t cord of poor Hogarth's heart-&s;trings, will come down in his laced hat, like <HI>General</HI> Churchill, Or Tiddy-Doll, and being a member of the Uni|ver&s;ity of Cambridge, it is taken for granted that the Convocation will take this publick oppor|tunity of admitting him <HI>ad eundem.</HI> At the &s;ame time too the News-papers having already in|formed us that <HI>the Member of Parliament for Ayle&s;bury</HI> will be here in his way to Stowe, the Squire is hourly expected with a grand retinue of Compo&s;itors, Pre&s;smen, Devils, and <HI>his own extempore travelling Pre&s;s</HI> from Great George Street, We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>Such, it &s;eems, and &s;o various, are the &s;en|timents of different little cabals in this Town and Univer&s;ity, concerning the real Per&s;on of TERRAE-FILIUS. Whether he be either, or nei|ther, or one, or all of the characters above|mentioned, time alone mu&s;t di&s;cover.

<P>THE reigning pa&s;&s;ion of this nation, for &s;ome few years pa&s;t, &s;eems to have been the love of Shews, and Spectacles, and Fe&s;tivals, and Solemnities. During the war, the people betrayed &s;everal &s;ymp|toms of this rage after fine &s;ights, and many thou|&s;ands followed the Camp, as young en&s;igns often take to the army, for the &s;ake of its &s;plendor and gaiety. One week all the vehicles in England and from the coach and &s;ix, or landau with two po&s;tilions, down to the one hor&s;e chai&s;e, and &s;ober
<PB N="243" REF="265">
&s;ulky, were whirling pa&s;&s;engers along the road from all quarters towards Port&s;mouth, to &s;ee the Fleet a&s;&s;embled at Spithead; and the next, the &s;ame people were tran&s;ported with the &s;ame rapi|dity, by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion for a &s;ight and a croud, to behold the evolutions and <HI>manoeuvres</HI> of the re|giments of Militia embodied and encamped at Winche&s;ter. At the Coronation the tide of company from every county in the kingdom flowed, like rivers di&s;charging them&s;elves into the &s;ea, into the metropolis. La&s;t &s;ummer one would have imagined that all the famous witches of Lanca&s;hire had been at work to draw the whole city of London from its foundations, which &s;eemed, like Birnam wood going to Dun&s;inane, to be all moving together to Pre&s;ton Guild. This &s;ummer, now that Oxford is become the &s;cene wherein the Grand Shew is exhibited, and the doors of the Sheldonian Theatre are thrown open for almo&s;t a whole week, it is no wonder that London once more empties it&s;elf into this magnificent re&s;ervoir, and that all ranks and degrees of people are a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee the doctors in &s;carlet, and to attend the Lectures of TERRAE-FILIUS.</P>
<P>There is not a man on earth, Ladies and Gen|tlemen, who is a truer lover of mirth and jollity
<PB N="244" REF="266">
than my&s;elf; and I take a mo&s;t particular delight in the pre&s;ent ENCAENIA. It gives me an un|&s;peakable plea&s;ure to &s;ee the new <HI>Dun&s;table-bonnets</HI> mixt with &s;quare caps, and a gown and petticoat by the &s;ide of a gown and ca&s;&s;ock. I could &s;tand whole hours to &s;ee the white fu&s;tian riding-habits and blue &s;attin-wai&s;tcoats make their entry at Ea&s;t-Gate; and am tran&s;ported to &s;ee the boot and the ba&s;ket of all the &s;tage-coaches filled with ro&s;in and cat-gut, and fiddles, and hautboys, and cla|rionets, and french-horns, and ba&s;s-viols, while the in&s;ide and out&s;ide of every machine is crouded with the performers, Engli&s;h and Italian, vocal and in&s;trumental. Fe&s;tivals and Solemnities have, I grant, their u&s;es and advantages; and far be it from me to attempt to era&s;e any of the red-letter days from <HI>the</HI> OXFORD <HI>Almanack!</HI> It mu&s;t however, at the &s;ame time be confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;cenes of grandeur, and &s;ea&s;ons of celebrity, which &s;erve merely for relaxation to the &s;tudious, and fill the intelligent mind with great ideas, often prove only new occa&s;ions of idlene&s;s to the holy-day-making trade&s;men, and open nothing but the mouth of the ignorant, who &s;tand agape, gazing with a fooli&s;h face of plea&s;ure and a&s;toni&s;hment. I am not one who lament as a di&s;appointment our not having
<PB N="245" REF="267">
<HI>fireworks</HI> on occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Peace; and think that the 40,000 people, a&s;&s;embled la&s;t week in Hyde-park, had &s;ufficient con&s;olation in the review. I am glad indeed to &s;ee our CHANCELLOR pre|&s;iding in per&s;on, for the fir&s;t time, at a publick Solemnity among us, yet do I not wi&s;h for the in|&s;tallation of another to produce more &s;pectacles, though as magnificent as what we &s;aw at the in&s;tallation of Lord WESTMORLAND: and for the above rea&s;ons, as well as for &s;ome others which I do not think it prudent or advi&s;able to mention at pre&s;ent, I hope it will be long, very long, before there is another Coronation!</P>
<P>Going along the High-&s;treet la&s;t Tue&s;day morning I was ob&s;erving, not without a &s;mile, one of tho&s;e modern tottering crazy vehicles, half-po&s;t-chai&s;e, half-chariot, neither one nor the other, and yet &s;omething of both, driving towards the Angel Inn-yard; but turning my eyes from the carriage to the per&s;ons it contained, whom &s;hould I &s;ee, but my good friend Mr. FOLIO the book|&s;eller, near St. Paul's, and his wife, Mrs. FOLIO; who at that very in&s;tant happening to dart the rays of her bright eyes in right angles upon me, &s;he pulled my Friend FOLIO by the &s;leeve, who &s;eemed half a-&s;leep by her &s;ide. FOLIO no &s;ooner
<PB N="246" REF="268">
&s;aw me, than he ran his head and neck a yard and a half out of the chariot window, and bawled out lu&s;tily Mr. &mdash; but hold, I mu&s;t not tell my name. I followed the chariot into the Inn-yard, and had the honour of handing out Mrs. FOLIO.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ceremonies occa&s;ioned by this our un|expected interview being over, and being quietly &s;eated in the parlour, Mr. FOLIO informed me, that having a new edition of a Je&s;t-Book printing at a private pre&s;s in Oxford, he took this oppor|tunity of vi&s;iting the Univer&s;ity, and giving Mrs. FOLIO an agreeable airing; after which he enquired very cordially after Mr. Fletcher of the Turle, Mr. Daniel Prince, and the re&s;t of his brother Book&s;ellers in Oxford. I find too, continued he, you have a TERRAE-FILIUS,&mdash;a new paper I &s;up|po&s;e,&mdash;pray who is the Author? Does it make a noi&s;e? Does it &s;ell? How many do they print? Would you be &s;o kind now, my dear Sir, (taking me by the hand and &s;miling) as to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in making proper extracts, and furni&s;h me with a few occa&s;ional paragraphs to &s;end up to the Ledger, and Lloyd's Evening Po&s;t? To the&s;e various in|terrogations I made no other reply, than enquiring after the younger part of the family,&mdash;I hope Mi&s;s FOLIO is well, Ma'am,&mdash;Very well Sir, I
<PB N="247" REF="269">
thank you, &s;aid Mrs. Folio; we had &s;ome thoughts of bringing her down with us, but my <HI>&s;pou&s;e</HI> had &s;uch a quantity of things to put into the chariot, that we could not ea&s;ily croud <HI>three on us</HI> into it: &s;o I have left Polly in our lodgings at I&s;lington Spa, and there, you know, &s;he can't be <HI>unked</HI> for want of company,&mdash;and if &s;he plea&s;es, &s;he may go to the <HI>Wells</HI> every night.&mdash;And how does <HI>young</HI> Mr. FOLIO do?&mdash;What! <HI>Bonus!</HI> &s;ays Mr. FOLIO, <HI>Bonus</HI> is entered in one of the col|leges&mdash;He has left St. Paul's School, and is a brother gown&s;man of your's; at which words he rung the bell, and on the appearance of the waiter, di&s;patched him to &mdash; College for young Ma&s;ter FOLIO, de&s;iring his company with &s;ome particular Friends at the Angel.</P>
<P>Till the return of the Me&s;&s;enger Mr. FOLIO, after having di&s;patched another waiter to the barber's with his wig, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with unpacking &s;ome parcels and valizes, which, it &s;eems, were what had filled up Mi&s;s FOLIO's place in the chariot. The fir&s;t he unfolded, he informed me were &s;ome &s;heets of a new work of his own writing, which he propo&s;ed to publi&s;h early in the en&s;uing winter. He pre&s;t me very hard to read &s;ome particular pa&s;&s;ages, which I evaded, pleading want of time
<PB N="248" REF="270">
and lei&s;ure to give it due attention in the pre&s;ent hurry and di&s;&s;ipation of the place.&mdash;Come, come, &s;ays he, I know you Gentlemen that write don't approve of <HI>us in the trade</HI> pretending to publi&s;h books of our own&mdash;but we have &s;ome <HI>good hands</HI> among us, I can tell you.&mdash;Oh, I know that.&mdash;Know it! Ay, but you none of you care to own it. For any thing, courtly and airy, for a Dra|matick Satire, or a modern Tragedy, we have Dod&s;ley in Pall-Mall,&mdash;Mr. Pope allowed <HI>him</HI> to be a good Poet&mdash;for Divinity and Morality we have Payne that lives in the Row&mdash;for Critici&s;m, or any thing in the <HI>Belles Lettres</HI> way, there is R. Griffiths,&mdash;why he writes half the <HI>Monthly Review</HI>&mdash;and then for the whole <HI>Circle of Sciences</HI> there's our old Friend Mr. Newbery, at the North Door of St. Paul's&mdash;and the Author of a late Pamphlet, called <HI>The Lives of the pre&s;ent Writers,</HI> a&s;&s;ures us for a fact that he has wrote two fa|vourite farces.</P>
<P>How much farther his zeal for the honour of <HI>the Trade</HI> would have carried him is uncertain, if his vehemence had not been broke in upon by the return of the me&s;&s;enger, and the arrival of Young FOLIO. The mother was charmed beyond expre&s;&s;ion with his appearance in the Academical
<PB N="249" REF="271">
Habit, and vowed he was grown half a head, or el&s;e that dre&s;s made him look &s;o much taller. Well, I prote&s;t it becomes him va&s;tly? Don't it? (turning to me) you mu&s;t know, Sir, his father intends <HI>making on him</HI> a Clergyman.&mdash;Ay, ay, the gown by all means! &s;aid Folio&mdash;But come, Bonus! you mu&s;t &s;hew your mother and me the Univer&s;ity&mdash;Mr. &mdash; I hope will favour us with his company to make <HI>the tower</HI> of the Colleges, and return afterwards to eat a bit of mutton with us at dinner. I accepted the invi|tation, and Mr. FOLIO having waited in his gold laced hat with a handkerchief of Mrs. FOLIO's about his ears, till the return of his wig, properly bu&s;hed out and powdered, and having in the interim equipped him&s;elf with a full &s;uit of pom|padour with gold buttons, which he had brought down carefully packed between pa&s;teboards, we &s;allied out of the Angel into the High-Street <HI>to &s;ee the Univer&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner got into the &s;treet, than we were carried by a kind of in&s;tinct into Mr. Parker's, not only to give Mr. FOLIO an oppor|tunity of &s;haking his old friend by the hand, but al&s;o in order to furni&s;h him&s;elf with one of Mr. Prince's <HI>Pocket Companions,</HI> without which
<PB N="250" REF="272">
he declared it was impo&s;&s;ible to go round the Uni|ver&s;ity. There, Sir, continued he applying him&s;elf to me, there's another in&s;tance of a <HI>Genius</HI> in a Book&s;eller. <HI>The Pocket Companion</HI> is all Mr. PRINCE's <HI>own,</HI>&mdash;not only his own property, but his own writing. One of your gown&s;men, indeed, has &s;ince wrote a <HI>New Guide,</HI>&mdash;but it won't do,&mdash;&s;haking his head,&mdash;it won't do,&mdash;much inferior to my Friend Daniel's.</P>
<P>We then cro&s;&s;ed the way to Queen's College, where Bonus, as FOLIO called him, informed us, that the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;quare had been lately rebuilt, and that there had been &s;ome &s;quabbles among the Fellows. FOLIO &s;aid the Chapel was fine, very fine, and quoted two lines out of Milton's <HI>Spen&s;ero&s;o,</HI> for &s;o he termed it, about <HI>a dim religious Light.</HI> As to Mrs. FOLIO, &s;he declared that nothing in the College plea&s;ed her &s;o much, as the figure over the door of <HI>her Maje&s;ty in a Cage.</HI>&mdash;But that &s;he &s;aid was very pretty, and &s;he liked it va&s;tly.</P>
<P>We then proceeded to ALL SOULS, and the RADCLIFF LIBRARY, at the fir&s;t of which places Bonus informed us, that the Common Room there was remarkable for the be&s;t port in Oxford. Some of the fellows, &s;ays he, have to&s;t off four
<PB N="251" REF="273">
bottles of it a day, for &s;everal years together, without doing them any manner of harm. FOLIO ob&s;erved, that neither the College Library, nor the Radcliff, were as yet half &s;ufficiently &s;tocked, and it would be a rare job to have the furni&s;hing them with books. Mrs. FOLIO &s;aid, that the Radcliff was a good deal like St. Paul's, only not half &s;o large or &s;o hand&s;ome. A queer &s;ort of building, Ma'am, &s;aid young Bonus,&mdash;a mere pepper-box,&mdash;and there,&mdash;(pointing to the turrets of All Souls) there are the &s;ugar-ca&s;ters.&mdash;This produced an univer&s;al laugh, which concluded with an ex|clamation of FOLIO's,&mdash;Well &s;aid, Bonus! egad, I don't think that would be ami&s;s in the new edition of the Jokes.</P>
<P>We then entered the Schools' Quadrangle, where Mr. FOLIO took upon him&s;elf to inform his wife that all the rudiments of learning were taught in that &s;pot. Here, &s;ays he, my dear, (pointing) there are Lectures read every morning,&mdash;Here the Stu|dents attend the Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity,&mdash;and here they attend the Hi&s;tory Profe&s;&s;or,&mdash;and here the Poetry Profe&s;&s;or,&mdash;and here the Profe&s;&s;or of Phy|&s;ick,&mdash;and here the Profe&s;&s;or of Civil Law,&mdash;and &s;o on,&mdash;all learned men that have large &s;alaries on purpo&s;e to lecture their pupils in the
<PB N="252" REF="274">
&s;ciences.&mdash;Ay, &s;ays Mrs. FOLIO, it is no won|der that they have all &s;o much <HI>Larning.</HI>&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to recount half their ob&s;ervations on the Picture-Gallery, the Bodleian Library, the Arun|del Marbles, the Pomfret Collection, the Cla|rendon Printing Hou&s;e, the Theatre, and the Mu|&s;eum. I can only recollect, that Mr. FOLIO met with an acquaintance among the compo&s;itors at the printing-hou&s;e, with whom he entered into con|ver&s;ation about the method of printing <HI>Ba&s;kerville's</HI> Bible without wetting the &s;heets before they were put to pre&s;s;&mdash;and that he &s;uppo&s;ed a good deal of money might be made of the M.S.S. in the <HI>Bodley</HI>;&mdash;that he compared the Mu&s;eum to Don Saltero's Coffee-hou&s;e, and that Mrs. FOLIO at going out a&s;ked the per&s;on who &s;hew'd the room, <HI>If there was no wax-work.</HI>&mdash;In the re&s;t of our circuit I remember nothing remarkable, except that Mrs. FOLIO was extremely delighted with the Ba&s;on and Mercury in the center of the great quadrangle at Chri&s;t-church, and told her hu&s;band &s;he wi&s;hed they had ju&s;t &s;uch a one in the middle of their garden at I&s;lington.</P>
<P>We then returned to the angel, and as &s;oon as dinner was ended, and the cloth taken away, Well, Bonus, &s;ays FOLIO, and what ha&s;t thou learnt
<PB N="253" REF="275">
here? Tell us &s;ome of thy &s;tudies,&mdash;come give your mother and me a <HI>little touch</HI> of the Ma|thematicks.&mdash;<HI>Bonus,</HI> being hard pre&s;&s;ed, was obliged to comply; and drawing a kind of figure with his finger in the wine that was &s;pilt on the table, uttered very gravely &s;ome incoherent jargon about A and B being equal to C and D, and pa|rallel lines, and equilateral triangles. FOLIO and his wife ob&s;erved him with infinite attention, and the mo&s;t vi&s;ible delight; and as &s;oon as he had done, This, &s;ays FOLIO,&mdash;this my dear, (addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his wife) is what <HI>we</HI> call <HI>Demon&s;tration.</HI> Sir, &s;ays Bonus, I did not think you had &s;o good a notion of the Mathematicks.&mdash;Child, &s;ays Mrs. FOLIO, your father has a general knowledge of every thing.</P>
<P>Not long after I took my leave, and could not help reflecting that to people like FOLIO and his wife, Sights and Shews afford but &s;mall entertain|ment and no in&s;truction: and that it would be al|mo&s;t &s;ufficient for the gratification of &s;uch minds, if Grand Solemnities, were to come round, like the year of Jubilee at Rome, or the blowing of the aloe, not above once in a hundred years.</P>

<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary that TERRAE-FILIUS, like the Senior Proctor and other great officers of this Univer&s;ity, &s;hould make an harangue at the Time of laying down his office; but it gives me
<PB N="255" REF="277">
infinite concern, that on this occa&s;ion, in&s;tead of glorying in &s;o favourable an opportunity to di&s;play my merits, I am obliged to make it my chief en|deavour to wipe off a mo&s;t infamous a&s;per&s;ion that has been thrown on my character, no le&s;s than the charge of being a Counterfeit and an Impo&s;tor. It is hard for a man on his death-bed to be put upon the proof of the reality of his exi&s;tence, and though I am alive and merry, of which I hope you are all fully convinced, yet I cannot brook the thought that TERRAE-FILIUS, &s;hould be ac|counted a kind of Ba&s;tard Production, (or as the lawyers term it) NULLIUS FILIUS; and that it &s;hould be in the power of Envy or Malice to make a blot in my e&s;cutcheon. I do not doubt, how|ever, of being able to blazon my title, and to prove that I am neither an <HI>U&s;urper</HI> nor a <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, indeed, that mo&s;t of my ance&s;tors were the mo&s;t noted manufacturers of Scandal, and great whole&s;ale dealers in Libel and <HI>Scandalum Magnat&ucirc;m</HI>; and that in this glorious occupation they nobly &s;u&s;tained all the pains and inconve|niences of martyrdom and per&s;ecution. I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s that my father was expelled the Univer&s;ity for villifying the grave and reverend heads of hou&s;es, and that my grandfather was expelled the Hou&s;e
<PB N="256" REF="278">
of Commons for libelling the honourable mem|bers, and reviling the con&s;titution. I cannot deny that mo&s;t part of my family have, at divers times, had the honour of being pumped, beat, and to&s;t in a blanket; that many of them have lain whole months in Newgate, and &s;tood in the pillory at the Royal Exchange, Temple-Bar, and Charing Cro&s;s; and that of &s;ome I might even ju&s;tly boa&s;t, that they were hanged for high-trea|&s;on. I mu&s;t own too that, for my own part, I nave not trod in the &s;teps of my predece&s;&s;ors; and though I am not con&s;cious of any &s;hameful de|generacy, yet I have never been on the brink of expul&s;ion for defamation. I have not &s;o much as been taken up: I never had my hou&s;e entered at midnight by king's me&s;&s;engers: neither I nor my printer can complain of the illegal &s;eizure of our papers, or bring actions again&s;t the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate for fal&s;e impri&s;onment: I never had the plea|&s;ure of having my no&s;e &s;lit; I have as yet both my ears; and have not, according to what I have hitherto been able to di&s;cover, any pro&s;pect of dying at Tyburn or Kennington-Common.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, ladies and gentlemen, as well as for the manner in which I have conducted my&s;elf in my office during the pre&s;ent Solemnity
<PB N="257" REF="279">
I find that &s;ome evil-minded per&s;ons have been in|duced to con&s;ider me and my writings as Spurious. They &s;ay, that I have di&s;appointed their expecta|tions. They complain that I have offered no af|front to the Chancellor or any other per&s;on of qua|laty; nor turned the &s;enior part of the Univer&s;ity into objects of Ridicule for the entertainment of fre&s;hmen and under-graduates. They confe&s;s that at fir&s;t they were induced to conceive better hopes of me, but that it may now be &s;aid of me, as it is of the month of March, that I came in like a lion, and go out like a lamb.</P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;everal other circum&s;tances, which I cannot pretend to palliate or refute, I can, however, very ea&s;ily account for. A Reverend Gentleman of Exeter College, eminent in all parts of Europe for his knowledge in Hebrew, in a late conte&s;ted elec|tion being accu&s;ed by the oppo&s;ite party of <HI>time-&s;erving,</HI> very &s;hrewdly an&s;wered, in vindication of him&s;elf and his a&s;&s;ociates, that <HI>they did not make the times, but the times made them.</HI> The Univer|&s;ity borrows its complection from its patrons, and the moon her light from the &s;un, and at a time when there is a general revolution of princi|ples, or to (invert a little the arrangement of the phra&s;e) when Revolution-Principles are general

among us, is it any wonder that the <HI>hone&s;t</HI> TERRAE-FILIUS &s;hould be as changeable as his Brethren?</P>
<P>I can remember the time, and indeed it is but a very little while ago, when a <HI>place</HI> was e&s;teemed at Oxford as a badge of corruption, and a <HI>green</HI> coat the livery of &s;ervitude. I can remember too that a certain great patriot informed the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, that Oxford was <HI>paved</HI> with di&s;affection and Jacobiti&s;m. But now the old <HI>true blue</HI> is faced, according to the court-fa&s;hion, with <HI>green</HI>; and the red and white ro&s;es were not more clo&s;ely twined together by the union of the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, than the OLD and NEW INTEREST in this county by the coalition and compromi&s;e at the late election of Lord Charles Spen&s;er and Sir James Da&s;hwood. We have lived to &s;ee the &s;taunch Doctor Black&s;tone on the point of being &s;ent to Ire|land as a Judge, and honoured with a patent of precedency and a &s;ilk gown. We have lived to &s;ee Sir Francis Da&s;hwood created Lord Le De&s;pen|&s;er, and appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Ma&s;ter of the Wardrobe. Sir John Phillips it is well known is a Privy Coun&s;ellor, and our Right Honourable Chancellor is Captain of the Band of Pen&s;ioners.
<Q><PB N="259" REF="281">Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis.</Q>
The Tories are all at court, and Oxonians are made Bi&s;hops. The Cocoa-Tree is running a race with Arthur's towards the golden goal of St. James's; and, it is &s;aid, that at the next meeting of the parliament a bill will be brought in for <HI>cleaning, lighting, and</HI> NEW-PAVING the &s;treets of Oxford by the Right Honourable Mr, PITT.</P>
<P>I may be believed al&s;o when I declare, upon the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> of an AUTHOR, that it is not for want of information or materials, that I have not made my paper a <HI>Chronique Scandaleu&s;e,</HI> a Journal of Defamation. I have received letters &s;ufficient to form a volume, anecdotes without number, and &s;atires, &s;onnets, epigrams, and acro&s;ticks by whole&s;ale. There is not a toa&s;t in the city or <HI>environs</HI> of Oxford, of whom I have not had a particular account; and there has not been a phaeton and four driven out of Oxford this &s;um|mer, or a &s;ingle excur&s;ion to Wallingford, that has not been faithfully regi&s;tered in MY <HI>black book.</HI> One corre&s;pondent has &s;ent me a piece, which he calls the Secret Hi&s;tory of Ditchley; and another has tran&s;mitted an exact detail of <HI>all</HI> the ceremo|nies on opening the newly-repaired church at We&s;t-Wycomb la&s;t Sunday, together with the copy
<PB N="260" REF="282">
of a <HI>carol</HI> on the occa&s;ion, which he tells me was written by Paul Whitehead, and &s;ung over Milk Punch in the Golden Ball. In &s;hort, &s;o willing are all to open the &s;luices of Scandal, that there is not a corner of the country from which I have not been favoured with &s;ome curious ar|ticles of intelligence, with an earne&s;t de&s;ire of their being communicated to the publick by the channel of my paper, &s;o that had I been di&s;po&s;ed to &s;it in judgment upon them, care has been taken to provide me a hand&s;ome calendar of delinquents.</P>
<P>A great number of corre&s;pondents have very freely and abundantly communicated their ob&s;erva|tions on the tran&s;actions of the pre&s;ent ENCAENIA: &s;ome have &s;ent me critici&s;ms on the ver&s;es and orations delivered in the theatre; and others have commented on the voice, ge&s;ture, and deportment of the &s;peakers, greatly lamenting that Mr. SHE|RIDAN, as heretofore, was not employed to in&s;truct our young nobility and gentry in the art of elocu|tion. One writer affects to be greatly di&s;gu&s;ted at the vehemence and frequency of the plaudits of the <HI>upper gallery,</HI> be&s;towed indi&s;criminately on the Chancellor or a &s;inger, Dr. KING or the fir&s;t fiddle.

At &s;uch a time, as well as in their printed gratulations, the mem|bers of the Univer&s;ity might be expected to &s;hew the extent of their learning, and we might not only, with the mo&s;t mode&s;t expectation, have pro|mi&s;ed our&s;elves &s;everal Greek odes after the man|ner of Pindar, and occa&s;ional pieces of Hebrew p&s;almody, but have flattered our&s;elves with the certain hopes of &s;eeing the elegant figure of Mr. Swinton delivering an oration in Etru&s;can or Phoenician.</P>
<P>In this place, as I am &s;ettling the account with my corre&s;pondents, it is al&s;o proper to acknow|ledge the receipt of &s;everal remarks on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Univer&s;ity, and hints for its improve|ment. A per&s;on who &s;igns him&s;elf <HI>Londinen&s;is,</HI> laments that the arts of politene&s;s, as well as the polite arts, are not taught at Oxford, and propo&s;es that Me&s;&s;ieurs HART and DUKES, or at lea&s;t one of them, &s;hould be invited down to in&s;truct our <HI>grown gentlemen,</HI> thinking that he might be of as much &s;ervice to the Univer&s;ity, and make as bril|liant a figure in that art, as Dr. Hayes in Mu&s;ick; on which con&s;ideration it might be expedient to ap|point him DANCING PROFESSOR. Another per|&s;on, a facetious clergyman of uncommon parts, who
<PB N="262" REF="284">
dates his letter from Lincoln College, wi&s;hes to &s;ee the intended &s;cheme of a riding-hou&s;e, (to which the profits of the la&s;t collection of the Clarendon papers were &s;uppo&s;ed to be appropri|ated) carried into immediate execution. He fore|&s;ees great advantage accruing to the church-mili|tant, from our Doctors in Divinty being taught to ride the Great Hor&s;e, and does not doubt but that, from their acknowledged &s;kill in hor&s;eman&s;hip, the Rector of his own hou&s;e, Lincoln College, and the Pre&s;ident of Corpus Chri&s;ti, will in&s;tantly be appointed joint ma&s;ters of the riding-hou&s;e, and have the &s;ole direction of the <HI>Man&eacute;ge.</HI></P>
<P>I have al&s;o received &s;everal rough draughts and curious portraits of academical characters, with the names, for fear of mi&s;take, at the bottom of the picture. A young buck of Chri&s;t Church has &s;ent me a cutting &s;atire on a &s;evere di&s;cipli|narian, who&s;e name and additions I do not think proper to mention; and a <HI>fellow of</HI> Trinity com|plains of being <HI>forced,</HI> with &s;everal more, to lay out an hundred pounds in taking a doctor's degree; and inveighs mo&s;t bitterly again&s;t <HI>tuft-hunters,</HI> and a per&s;on whom he calls Doctor Driver.</P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;everal other articles of intelligence extraordinary, I have had virtue enough to &s;up|pre&s;s,
<PB N="263" REF="285">
and think I de&s;erve the publick thanks both of the Town and Univer&s;ity, together with &s;ome more &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial marks of their favour, for my extraordinary moderation. The affairs of the corporation are, I fear, too much perplext to make me any hand&s;ome gratuity; but, I hope, in con&s;ideration of my clemency towards them and my tenderne&s;s to their wives and daugh|ters, at lea&s;t to have the compliment of my free|dom in a gold box, with a right of common on Port-Meadow. As to the Univer&s;ity, I expect on the next publick occa&s;ion to be pre&s;ented to an honorary degree, and that in the mean time, the Bur&s;ars of the &s;everal colleges will have direc|tions to make up a pur&s;e for TERRAE-FILIUS.</P>
<P>Publick writers, it is well known, have often been bought off, &s;ilenced with a bribe, or quieted with a pen&s;ion, when the fears of fine, pillory, and impri&s;onment have had no influence over their re&s;olutions, and all the terrors of the law have been let loo&s;e upon them in vain. Our own Times too will afford examples of writers, who, after having been di&s;appointed of the expected Rewards from the hands of Power and Munificence, have turned from the plea&s;ant path of Panegyrick, and gone upon the <HI>highway</HI> of Satire. For my own part,
<PB N="264" REF="286">
being naturally of a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, I had rather it &s;hould be <HI>made worth my while</HI> to pur|&s;ue the &s;mooth Turnpike-Road in which I have &s;et out. At pre&s;ent, being the fir&s;t of my family who has hot been expelled, I am re&s;olved to take my leave in good humour, and &s;hall conclude my pre&s;ent Cour&s;e of Lectures with the words in which the late worthy Bi&s;hop of Cloyne, who had <HI>ev'ry virtue under Heaven,</HI> and who &s;pent the la&s;t part of his life among&s;t us, u&s;ed often to de&s;cribe this Univer&s;ity.</P>
<Q>OXFORD is a fair city, &s;ituated in a plea&s;ant country; adorned with beautiful gardens and magnificent palaces; and a place where Reli|gion and Learning are kept in countenance.</Q>
