<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Piece is founded on the I&s;ola Di&s;abitata of the celebrated ABBE METASTASIO: In reading the Perform|ance of that great Genius, the pre&s;ent Writer received &s;o exqui&s;ite a Plea&s;ure, that he contracted a Pa&s;&s;ion for the Subject, and could not refrain from exerci&s;ing his Pen upon it. In the Pro&s;e|cution of his Plan, he knew enough of the mo|dern Theatre, to perceive that it was thin of what our Play-followers call Bu&s;ine&s;s; and he was aware that on the Stage it might prove (to u&s;e <HI>Milton</HI>'s Words) <HI>very different from what among us pa&s;&s;es for Be&s;t.</HI> The &s;ame Remark was made by a Friend of the Author's, who thought it hazardous to offer to a popular A&s;&s;embly a Piece, in which there were none of tho&s;e Strokes that generally &s;ucceed with the Multitude. "Can't you," &s;aid he, <Q>throw in &s;omething here and there to &s;ea&s;on it more to the public Appetite?&mdash;Suppo&s;e you were to change the Title, and fix the Scene among the <HI>Anthropophagi,</HI> or among the <HI>Men, who&s;e Heads do grow beneath their Shoulders</HI>&mdash;a few of tho&s;e extraordinary Per&s;onages exhibited on the Stage, will prove very acceptable:&mdash;What think you of an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Servant in it?&mdash;That certainly will in&s;ure Succe&s;s, the more e&s;pecially if you add &s;ome aerial Beings, and conclude the Whole with a drunken Song by the Tars of <HI>Old Eng|land.</HI></Q>&mdash;The Author was &s;en&s;ible of the Force of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations; but the GREAT MILTON (mentioned above) &s;tared him in the Face, with his Reflections on <Q>the Error of introducing tri|vial and vulgar Per&s;ons, which, by all Judicious, hath been counted ab&s;urd, and brought in with|out Di&s;cretion, CORRUPTLY to gratify the Peo|ple.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide,</HI> Preface to <HI>Sam&s;on Agoni&s;tes.</HI></NOTE>&mdash;He therefore determined to pre&s;erve the
<PB REF="4">
Integrity of his original De&s;ign, and to try what would be the Effect of a &s;imple Fable, with, but few Incidents, &s;upported entirely by the Spirit of Poetry, Sentiment, and Pa&s;&s;ion. To combine the&s;e there Qualities is indeed an arduous Ta&s;k; and the Author, therefore, does not flatter him&s;elf that he has entirely &s;ucceeded in &s;o difficult an Attempt.</P>
<P>In Ju&s;tice to METASTASIO, he thinks proper to inform the mere <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader, that he hath not been a Tran&s;lator on this Occa&s;ion, but has fol|lowed the Impul&s;e of his own Imagination, ex|cepting in a few Pa&s;&s;ages. The ITALIAN POET gave the Fable; the pre&s;ent Writer made his own U&s;e of it; or in other Words, the Ground-work, or <HI>Canevas,</HI> (as the <HI>French</HI> call it) is METASTASIO'S; for the Colouring Mr. <HI>Murphy</HI> is an&s;werable.</P>
<P>He could not but be &s;urprized to find that, on the fir&s;t Night, the Scene in the third Act, between <HI>Sylvia</HI> and <HI>Henrico,</HI> was deemed equivocal. There is always a &s;ufficient Number ready to a&s;cribe to an Author various Meanings, which he never had, "and &s;ee at Cannon's what was never there."&mdash;To the&s;e Gentlemen he returns his Thanks; but the Species of Wit, which they are willing to allow him, he begs leave publickly to di&s;claim. The Cha|racter of a Girl, who has never &s;een a Man, and who has been taught to think of &s;uch a Being with Horror, is merely imaginary; but the po&s;&s;ible, or Poetical Exi&s;tence of &s;uch a Girl being once e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, it is to be wi&s;hed that the Critics would agree what Que&s;tions it is natural for her to a&s;k on her fir&s;t Interview with a Man, METASTASIO makes her &s;ay,</P>
<Q><L>Che vuoi da me?</L>
<L>Un Uom Sei dunque!</L>
<L>Andiamo In&s;ieme.</L>
<L>Ah! troppo ron trattenerli, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P><PB REF="5">And the&s;e little Touches, (&s;o differently do we judge in <HI>England</HI>) were thought abroad to be deli|cate Strokes of the mo&s;t elegant Simplicity.</P>
<P>He could wi&s;h it had been univer&s;ally under|&s;tood that it was not a TRAGEDY he offered to the Public, but a DRAMATIC POEM; that is to &s;ay, a Piece with &s;ome intere&s;ting Situations to engage the Affections, but which affords more Room for a Picture&s;que Imagination to di&s;play it&s;elf, than is generally allowed to the more important Concerns of real Tragedy, where the Di&s;tre&s;s &s;hould be al|ways encrea&s;ing, where the Pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould be al|ways ri&s;ing to fuller and &s;tronger Emotions, and where of Cour&s;e the Poet ought not to find Lei|&s;ure for Imagery and De&s;cription. Had this been felt and acknowledged, no Body would have looked for another Kind of Entertainment than was pro|mi&s;ed, and the Smiles ari&s;ing from SYLVIA'S Dread of a Man (on the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of him), and her gradual Attachment to him in Compliance with natural In&s;tinct, would never have been judged incon&s;i&s;tent with the Colour of the Whole. But if the Author of the <HI>De&s;ert I&s;land</HI> has erred in this, he has the Con&s;olation of having erred with the greate&s;t Poet now in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>As many of the malevolent Writers of the Age have heretofore honoured the Author with their Abu&s;e, and as he was apprehen&s;ive that they &s;till remained under the Oppre&s;&s;ion of their Dullne&s;s and Ob&s;curity, it was deemed proper to call them forth into Daylight, by exhibiting one general Repre&s;entative of them all on the Stage. For this he returns his Thanks to the Author of the Prologue; and if any needy Book&s;ellers, or un|happy Authors, can find their Account in taking further Liberties with him, he hereby declares, he &s;hould be &s;orry not to have Merit enough to pro|voke &s;ome of them, and for their Encouragement,
<PB REF="6">
he adds in the Words of the noble Author of the <HI>Characteri&s;tics,</HI> that <Q>He will never reply, un|le&s;s he &s;hould hear of them or their Works in any good Company a Twelve-month after.</Q></P>
