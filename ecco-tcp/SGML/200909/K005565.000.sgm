<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> An Account of him from his Childhood, to the Seventeenth Year of his Age.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>John Janeway</HI> was born in the Year 1633. <HI>October</HI> 27. of religious Parents, in <HI>Tylly</HI> in the County of <HI>Hertford.</HI> He &s;oon gave his Parents the Hope of much Comfort, and the Symp|toms of &s;omething more than ordinary quickly ap|peared in him, &s;o that &s;ome who &s;aw this <HI>Child,</HI> much feared that his Life would be but <HI>&s;hort;</HI> others hoped that God had &s;ome Work to do by or for him; he &s;hewed that neither of them were mi&s;taken in their Conjectures concerning him. He &s;oon out-ran his Superiours for Age, in <HI>Learning.</HI> And it was thought by no incompetent Judges, that for Pregnancy of <HI>Wit,</HI> Solidity of <HI>Judgment,</HI> the Va&s;tne&s;s of his <HI>Intellectuals,</HI> and the Greatne&s;s of his <HI>Memory,</HI> he had no <HI>Superiours,</HI> and few <HI>Equals,</HI> con&s;idering his Age and Education.</P>
<P>He was initiated in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue by his <HI>Fa|ther;</HI> afterwards he was brought up in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s School in <HI>London,</HI> where he made a con&s;iderable Pro|ficiency in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> under the Care of Mr. <HI>Langley.</HI> When he was about eleven Years old he took a great Fancy to <HI>Arithmetick</HI> and the <HI>Hebrew Tongue.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">About this Time his Parents removing into a little Village called <HI>A&s;poden,</HI> had the Opportunity of hav|ing their <HI>Son</HI> in&s;tructed by a learned Neighbour, who was plea&s;ed to count it a Diver&s;ion, to read <HI>Mathe|maticks</HI> to him, being then about twelve Years old; and he made &s;uch Progre&s;s in tho&s;e Studies, that he read <HI>Oughtred</HI> with Under&s;tanding, before he was thirteen Years old. A Per&s;on of Quality, hearing of the admirable Proficiency of this Boy, &s;ent for him up to <HI>London,</HI> and kept him with him for &s;ome time, to read <HI>Mathematicks</HI> to him. That which made him the more to be admired was, That he did what he did with the greate&s;t Facility. He had no &s;mall Skill in Mu&s;ick and other Concomitants of the Mathema|ticks.</P>
<P>In the Year 1646, he was cho&s;en by Mr. <HI>Rous</HI> the Provo&s;t of <HI>Eaton</HI> College, one of the Foundation of that School. Where he gave no un&s;uitable Returns to the high Expectation that was conceived of him.</P>
<P>After a little Continuance at <HI>Eaton</HI> he obtained Leave of his Ma&s;ter to go to <HI>Oxford,</HI> to perfect him|&s;elf in the Study of <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> where being with Dr. <HI>Ward,</HI> one of the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Univer&s;ity, he attained to a &s;trange Exactne&s;s in that Study, nothing being within the Reach of a <HI>Man</HI> but he would un|dertake and gra&s;p. The Doctor looked upon him as one of the <HI>Wonders of his Age;</HI> loved him dearly, and could not for &s;ome time after his <HI>Death</HI> &s;carce men|tion his Name without <HI>Tears.</HI> When he had &s;pent about a Quarter of a Year with Dr. <HI>Ward</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he was commanded to return to <HI>Eaton,</HI> where he &s;oon gave Proof of his Improvement of his Time while he was <HI>ab&s;ent,</HI> by calculating of the Eclip&s;es for many Years before hand; &s;o that by this Time he had many <HI>Eyes</HI> upon him as the Glory of the School. Yet he did not di&s;cover the lea&s;t Affectation or Self-conceit, neither did any di&s;cernable Pride attend the&s;e Excel|lencies. So that every one took more Notice of his <HI>Parts</HI> than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>At about &s;eventeen Years old he was cho&s;e to <HI>King's
<PB N="5" REF="4">
College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge;</HI> at which time the Electors did even contend for the Patronage of this <HI>Scholar.</HI> He was cho&s;en fir&s;t that Year, and an elder Brother of his in the &s;ixth Place; but he was very willing to change Places with his elder Brother, letting him have the fir&s;t, and thankfully accepting of the &s;ixth Place.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides his great Learning, and many other Orna|ments of Nature, his Deportment was &s;o &s;weet and lovely, his Demeanour &s;o courteous and obliging, many of them who had little Kindne&s;s for Morality, much le&s;s for Grace, could not but &s;peak well of him. His great Wi&s;dom and Learning did even command Re&s;pect: He had an excellent Power over his Pa&s;&s;ions, and was in a great Mea&s;ure free from the Vice, which u&s;ually attends &s;uch an Age and Place.</P>
<P>But all this while he under&s;tood little of the Worth of Chri&s;t, and his own Soul; he &s;tudied indeed the Heavens, and knew the Motion of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, but he thought little of God, who made the&s;e Things; or of his own Heart; he did not as yet much bu&s;y him&s;elf in the &s;erious Ob&s;ervation of the wandering of his Spirit; the Creature had not yet led him to the Creator; he was &s;till too ready to take up with mere Speculation; but God, when he was about eighteen Years old, &s;hone in upon his Soul with Power; and convinced him what a poor Thing it was to know &s;o much of the Heavens and never come there. And that the greate&s;t Knowledge in the World without Chri&s;t, was but an empty dry Bu&s;ine&s;s. He now thought Mr. <HI>Bolton</HI> had &s;ome Rea&s;ons on his Side, when he &s;aid, <HI>Give me the mo&s;t magnificent glorious Worlding, that ever trod upon earthly Mould, richly crowned with all the Ornaments and Excellencies of Na|ture, Art, Policy, Preferment, or what Heart can wi&s;h be&s;ides; yet without the Life of Grace, to animate and enable them, he were to the Eye of heavenly Wi&s;dom but as a rotten Carca&s;s, &s;tuck over with Flowers, magnified Dung, guilded Rottenne&s;s, golden Damnation.</HI> He began now to be of <HI>Anaxagoras</HI>'s Mind, That his Work upon Earth, was to &s;tudy Heaven and get thither,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
and that except a Man might be admitted to greater Preferment than this World can be&s;tow, it was not worth the while to be born.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of his Conver&s;ion and Carriage when Fellow of the College</HEAD>
<P>THE great Work of <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> was not carried on upon his Soul, in that dreadful Manner, that it is upon &s;ome, but the Lord was plea&s;ed, &s;weetly to unlock his Heart, by the exemplary Life, and hea|venly Di&s;cour&s;e of a young Man in the College, who&s;e Heart God had enflamed with Love to his Soul; he quickly made an Attempt upon this y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ung Man, and the Spirit of God &s;et home his Coun&s;els with &s;uch Power, that they proved effectual, for his awakening; being accompanied with the preaching of Dr. <HI>Hill,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Arrow&s;mith,</HI> together with the reading of Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s Saint's Everla&s;ting Re&s;t.</P>
<P>Now a mighty Alteration might ea&s;ily be di&s;cerned in him. He began not to ta&s;te &s;o much Sweetne&s;s in tho&s;e Kind of Studies, which he &s;o greedily imploy'd him&s;elf in formerly. He began to pity them who were curious in their Enquiries after every thing, but that which is mo&s;t needful to be known, <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>them&s;elves;</HI> and that which &s;ometimes was his Gain, he now counted Lo&s;s for <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> yea doubtle&s;s he e&s;teemed all Things but as Dung and Dro&s;s in Compari&s;on of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and de&s;ired to know nothing but <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and him <HI>crucified.</HI> Not that he looked upon human Learning as u&s;ele&s;s: But when fixed below Chri&s;t and not improved for Chri&s;t; he looked upon Wi&s;dom as Folly, and Learning as Madne&s;s, and that which would make one more like the Devil, and more fit for his Service.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Janeway</HI> now con&s;idered how he might be&s;t improve what he did already know, and turn all his
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Studies into the right Channel: Grace did not take him off from, but made him more diligent and &s;piri|tual in his Study. And now Chri&s;t was at the End and Bottom of every thing: How did he plot and contrive how he might mo&s;t expre&s;s his Love and Thankful|ne&s;s to him who had brought him out of Darkne&s;s into his marvellous Light! To this End he &s;ent up and down Packets of divine Letters, in which, he did di&s;|cour&s;e &s;o &s;ub&s;tantially and experimentally of the great Things of God, that it would not at all have unbe|come &s;ome grey Head to have owned what he wrote.</P>
<P>He was not a little like young <HI>Elihu,</HI> in who&s;e Words he u&s;ed to excu&s;e his Freedom with Per&s;ons of Years, who&s;e Souls he dearly pitied. He &s;aid, <HI>Days &s;hould &s;peak, and Multitude of Years &s;hould teach Wi&s;dom, but there is a Spirit in a Man, and the In&s;piration of the Al|mighty giveth them Under&s;tanding; I am full of Mat|ter, the Spirit within me con&s;traineth me: Behold my Belly is as Wine which hath no Vent, it is ready to bur&s;t like new Bottles, I will &s;peak that I may be refre&s;hed.</HI> O then how &s;weet was the Savour of his Graces! He could not but &s;peak the Things which he had &s;een and heard; and even invite all the World to ta&s;te and &s;ee how good the Lord was.</P>
<P>He began fir&s;t with his Relations, begging and wooing of them to think of their immortal Souls, and to lay in &s;peedy Provi&s;ions for a Death-bed and Eter|nity. Oh! with what Compa&s;&s;ion did he plead the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t with their Souls! What pathetick Expre&s;&s;ions did he u&s;e, what vehement Expo&s;tulations, how frequent, how particular in his Applications to them! O with what Gravity and Maje&s;ty would he &s;peak of the My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Read what his Language was (when he was between <HI>eighteen</HI> and <HI>nineteen</HI> Years old) in a Letter to a Friend that had the Care of many Children.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Charge is great upon a temporal Account, but greater upon a &s;piritual. Out of an earne&s;t De&s;ire of the Good of Souls and your own Joy and Peace
<PB N="8" REF="7">
I importunately reque&s;t that you &s;hould have a great Care of your Children, and be often dropping in &s;ome whol|&s;ome Admonitions; and this I humbly, with Submi&s;&s;ion to your Judgment in it, commend to you: Not to admoni&s;h them always together, but likewi&s;e privately one by one. Wherein you may plea&s;e to pre&s;s upon them their natural Corruption, the Nece&s;&s;ity of Regeneration, the Excellency of Chri&s;t, and how un&s;peakably lovely it is to &s;ee young ones &s;itting out for Heaven. This way I think may do mo&s;t good, having had Experience of it my&s;elf in &s;ome &s;mall Mea&s;ure: God grant that all may work for the edi|fying of tho&s;e who are committed to you. I leave you under the Protection of him that hath loved us, and given him&s;elf for us &mdash;</P>
</LETTER>
<P>When he was about twenty Years old, he was made Fellow of the College, which did not a little advance tho&s;e noble Projects which he had for the promoting of the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Lord Chri&s;t.</HI> Then how &s;weetly would he in&s;inuate into the young ones, de&s;iring to carry as many of them as po&s;&s;ible he could along with him to Heaven: Many Attempts he made upon &s;ome of the &s;ame Hou&s;e, that he might &s;ea&s;on them with Grace, and animate, and encourage tho&s;e who were <HI>looking towards Heaven.</HI> And as for his own Rela|tions, never was there a more compa&s;&s;ionate and ten|der-hearted Brother. How many pathetick Letters did he &s;end to them! and how did he follow them with <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Tears.</HI></P>
<P>Read what his Heart was, in the following Lines.</P>
<Q>Di&s;tance of Place cannot at all le&s;&s;en that natural Bond whereby we are conjoined in Blood, neither ought to le&s;&s;en that of Love. Nay, where true Love is, it cannot; for Love towards you I can on|ly &s;ay this. That I feel it better than I can expre&s;s it: But Love felt and not expre&s;&s;ed is little worth. I therefore de&s;ire to make my Love manife&s;t in the be&s;t Way I can. Let us look upon one another not as Brethren only, but as Members of the &s;ame Body whereof Chri&s;t is the Head. Let us therefore breath and hunger after Him, &s;o that our clo&s;e Knot
<PB N="9" REF="8">
may meet in Chri&s;t: If we are in Chri&s;t and Chri&s;t in us, then we &s;hall be one with one another. This I know, you cannot complain for want of In&s;truc|tion, God hath not been to us a dry Wilderne&s;s; you have had Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept; he hath planted you by the Rivers of Water: It is the Lord alone indeed who maketh fruitful, but yet we are not to &s;tand &s;till and do nothing. There is a Crown worth looking for; &s;eek therefore, and that earne&s;tly. Oh! &s;eek by continual Prayer, keep your Soul in a praying Frame, this is a great and nece&s;&s;ary Duty; nay, a high and precious Privilege. If thou can&s;t &s;ay nothing, come and lay thy&s;elf in an humble Man|ner before the Lord. You may believe me, for I have experienced what I &s;ay. There is more Sweet|ne&s;s in one Glimp&s;e of God's Love, than in all that the World can afford. Oh! do but try; Oh! ta&s;te and &s;ee how good the Lord is. Get into a Corner and throw your&s;elf down before the Lord, and beg of God to make you &s;en&s;ible of your lo&s;t State by Nature, and of the Excellency and Nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t. Say, Lord give me a broken Heart, &s;often and melt me. Any thing in the World, &s;o I may be but enabled to value Chri&s;t, and be per&s;waded to accept of him, as he is tendered in the Go&s;pel. O that I may be delivered from the Wrath to come! Oh! a Ble&s;&s;ing for me, even for me! And re&s;olve not to be content till the Lord have in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure an&s;wered you. Oh! my Bowels yearn towards you. Oh! that you did but know with what Af|fection I write now unto you, and what Prayers and Tears are mingled with the&s;e Lines! The Lord &s;et the&s;e Things home, and give you an Heart to ap|ply them to your&s;elf; the Lord ble&s;s all the Means that you enjoy, for his Ble&s;&s;ing is all in all. Give me leave to deal plainly, and to come yet a little clo&s;e to you, for I love your Soul &s;o well, that I cannot bear the Thoughts of the Lo&s;s of it. Know this, that except a Man be born again, he cannot
<PB N="10" REF="9">
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: God's Favour is not to be recovered without it. This new Birth hath its Foundation laid in a Sen&s;e of Sin and a godly Sorrow for it, and a Heart &s;et again&s;t it; without this there can be no Salvation. Look well about you, and &s;ee into your&s;elf, and thou wilt &s;ee that thou art at Hell's Mouth without this fir&s;t Step, and nothing but free Grace and pure Mercy is be|tween you and the State of the Devils. The Lord deliver us from a &s;ecure carele&s;s Heart! Here you &s;ee a natural Man's Condition. How dare&s;t thou then lie down in Security. Oh! look about for your Soul's Sake. What &s;hall I &s;ay, what &s;hall I do to awaken your poor Soul! I &s;ay again, wthout Repentance there is no Remi&s;&s;ion; and Repentance it&s;elf may lo&s;e its Labour, if it be not in the right Manner. Tears and Groans, and Prayers will not do without Chri&s;t. Mo&s;t when they are convinced of Sin, and are under Fears of Hell, reform &s;ome|thing, and thus the Wound is healed, and by this Thou&s;ands fall &s;hort of Heaven. For if we be not brought off from our&s;elves, and our Righteou&s;ne&s;s as well as our Sins, we are never like to be &s;aved. We mu&s;t &s;ee an ab&s;olute Need of a Chri&s;t, and give our&s;elves up to him, and count all but Dung and Dro&s;s in compari&s;on of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Look therefore for Mercy only in Chri&s;t, for his Sake rely upon God's Mercy. The Terms of the Go&s;pel are, Repent and Believe; gracious Terms! Mercy for fetching, nay, Mercy for de&s;iring, nay, for no-nothing but receiving. Do&s;t thou de&s;ire Mercy and Grace? I know thou do&s;t. Even this is the Gift of God to de&s;ire, hunger after Chri&s;t; let De&s;ires put you upon Endeavours, the Work it&s;elf is &s;weet; yea, Repentance and Mourning it&s;elf hath more Sweetne&s;s in it, than all the World's Comforts. Upon Repentance and Believing comes Ju&s;tification. After this Sanctification, by the Spirit dwelling in us. By this we come to be the Children of God, to be made Partaker of the Divine Nature, to lead new
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Lives, to have a Suitablene&s;s to God. It is unwor|thy a Chri&s;tian to have &s;uch a narrow Spirit as not to act for Chri&s;t with all one's Heart, and Soul, and Strength. Be not a&s;hamed of Chri&s;t, be not afraid of the Frowns and Scoffs of the Wicked. Be &s;ure to keep a Con&s;cience void of Offence, and by no means yield to any known Sin; be much in Prayer, and in &s;ecret Prayer, and in reading the Scriptures. Therein are laid up the glorious My&s;teries which are hid from many Eyes. My greate&s;t De&s;ire is, that God would work his own great Work in you. I de&s;ire to &s;ee you not as formerly, but that the Lord would make me an In&s;trument of your Soul's Good, for which I grealy long.</Q>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> His great Love to Prayer.</HEAD>
<P>HE was mighty in Prayer, and his Spirit was of|tentimes &s;o tran&s;ported in it, that he forgot the Weakne&s;s of his own Body and of other Spirits: In|deed the Acquaintance that he had with God was &s;o &s;weet, and his Conver&s;e with him &s;o frequent, that when he was engaged in Duty, he &s;carce knew how to leave that which was &s;o delightful to his Spirit. His con&s;tant Cour&s;e for &s;ome Years was this. He prayed at lea&s;t three times a Day in &s;ecret &s;ometimes &s;even times, twice a Day in the Family or College. And he found the Sweetne&s;s of it beyond Imagination, and enjoyed wonderful Communion with God. He could &s;ay by Experience, That the Ways of Wi&s;dom were Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her Paths Peace. He knew what it was to wre&s;tle with God, and he could &s;carce come off his Knees without his Father's Ble&s;&s;|ing. He was u&s;ed to conver&s;e with God, with a <HI>holy Familiarity</HI> as a <HI>Friend,</HI> and would upon all Occa&s;ions run to him for Advice, and had many &s;trange and im|mediate <HI>An&s;wers</HI> of Prayer. One of which I think it not impertinent to give an Account of.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">His Honoured Father, Mr. <HI>William Janeway,</HI> Mi|ni&s;ter of <HI>Kel&s;hall</HI> in <HI>Hartford&s;hire,</HI> being &s;ick, and be|ing under &s;omewhat dark Apprehen&s;ions as to the State of his Soul, he would often &s;ay to his Son <HI>John:</HI> "Oh Son! this pa&s;&s;ing into Eternity is a great Thing, this Dying is a &s;olemn Bu&s;ine&s;s, and enough to make one's Heart ake, that hath not his Pardon &s;ealed, and his Evidences for Heaven clear. And truly Son, I am under no &s;mall Fears as to my own E&s;tate for another World. Oh! that God would clear his Love! Oh! that I could &s;ay chearfully, I can die, and upon good Grounds be able to look Death in the Face, and ven|ture upon Eternity with well-grounded Peace and Comfort."</P>
<P>Seeing his Father continuing under De&s;pondings of Spirit (though no Chri&s;tians that knew him but had a high E&s;teem of him for his Uprightne&s;s) he got by him&s;elf, and &s;pent &s;ome time in wre&s;tling with God upon his Account, earne&s;tly begging of God that he would fill him with Joy un&s;peakable in believing, and that he would &s;peedily give him &s;ome Token for Good, that he might joyfully and honourably leave this World. After he was ri&s;en from his Knees, he came down to his Father, and a&s;ked him, how he felt him&s;elf. His Father made no An&s;wer for &s;ome time, but wept exceedingly, (a Pa&s;&s;ion that he was not &s;ubject to) and continued for &s;ome con&s;iderable time weeping, &s;o that he was not able to &s;peak. But at la&s;t having recovered him&s;elf, with un&s;peakably Joy he bur&s;t out: "Oh! Son! now it is come, it is come, it is come; I ble&s;s God I can die; the Spirit of God hath wit|ne&s;&s;ed with my Spirit that I am his Child. Now I can look up to God as my dear Father, and Chri&s;t as my Redeemer; I can now &s;ay, this is my Friend, and this is my Beloved. My Heart is full, it is brim full, I can hold no more. I know now what that Sentence means, The Peace of God which pa&s;&s;eth all Under|&s;tanding; I know now what that white Stone is where|in a new Name was written, which none know but they who have it. And that Fit of Weeping which
<PB N="13" REF="12">
you &s;aw in me, was a Fit of overpowered Love and Joy, &s;o great that I could not contain my&s;elf: Neither can I expre&s;s what glorious Di&s;coveries God had made of him&s;elf unto me. And had that Joy been greater, I que&s;tion whether I could have born it, and whether it would not have &s;eparated Soul and Body. Ble&s;s the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me ble&s;s his holy Name, that hath pardoned all my Sins and &s;eal|ed the Pardon. He hath healed my Wounds, and cau&s;ed the Bones which he had broken to rejoice. Oh! help me to ble&s;s the Lord, he hath put a new Song into my Mouth: Oh! ble&s;s the Lord for his infinite Goodne&s;s! Oh! now I can die! It is nothing, I ble&s;s God I can die. I de&s;ire to be di&s;&s;olved and to be with Chri&s;t." You may well think that his Son's Heart was not a little refre&s;h'd to hear &s;uch Words, and &s;ee &s;uch a Sight, and to meet the Me&s;&s;enger that he had &s;ent to Heaven returned back again &s;o &s;peedily. It was &s;o immediate and clear an An&s;wer of his own Prayers, as if God had &s;aid unto him, Thy Tears and Prayers are heard for thy Father: Thou ha&s;t like a Prince prevailed with God; thou ha&s;t God the Ble&s;&s;ing: Go down and &s;ee.</P>
<P>Upon this, the young Man too broke forth into Prai&s;es, and even into an Exta&s;y of Joy, that God &s;hould deal &s;o familiarly with him; and the Father and Son together were &s;o full of Joy, Light, Life, Love and Prai&s;e, that there was a little Heaven in the Place. He could not then but expre&s;s him&s;elf in this Manner. "Oh ble&s;&s;ed, for ever ble&s;&s;ed be God for his infinite Grace! Oh who would not pray unto God! Verily he is a God that heareth Prayers, and that my Soul knows right well." And then he told his joyful Father, how much he was affected with his former De&s;pondings, and what he had been praying for ju&s;t before with all the Earne&s;tne&s;s he could. His Father hearing this, and perceiving that his former Comforts came by Prayer, and his own Child's Prayer too, was the more refre&s;hed, and the more confirmed, that it was from the Spirit of God, and no Delu&s;ion. And
<PB N="14" REF="13">
immediately, his Son &s;tanding by, he fell into another Fit of triumphing Joy, his weak Body being almo&s;t ready to &s;ink under that great Weight of Glory that &s;hone in &s;o powerfully upon his Soul. He could then &s;ay, "Now let thy Servant depart in Peace; for my Eyes have &s;een thy Salvation." He could now walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death and fear no Evil. Oh! how &s;weet a thing is it to have one's In|tere&s;t in Chri&s;t cleared, how comfortable to have our Calling and Election made &s;ure! How lovely is the Sight of a &s;miling Je&s;us when one is dying! how re|fre&s;hing is it, when Heart and Fle&s;h and all are failing, to have God for the Strength of our Heart and our Portion for ever! Oh! did the fooli&s;h unexperienced World but know what the&s;e Things mean, did they but under&s;tand what it is to have their Sen&s;es &s;piritual|ly exerci&s;ed, could they but ta&s;te and &s;ee how good the Lord is, it would &s;oon cau&s;e them to di&s;reli&s;h their low and bruti&s;h Plea&s;ures, and look upon all worldly Joys as infinitely &s;hort of one <HI>Glimp&s;e of God's Love!</HI> After this, his <HI>Father</HI> had a &s;weet Calm upon his Spirits, and went in the Strength of that Provi&s;ion, 'till he came within the Gates of the <HI>New Jeru&s;alem:</HI> Having all his Graces greatly improved, and &s;hewed &s;o much Humility, Love of God, Contempt of the World, &s;uch prizing of Chri&s;t, &s;uch Patience as few Chri&s;tians ar|rive to; e&s;pecially his Faith, by which with extraordi|nary Confidence he ca&s;t his <HI>Widow</HI> and <HI>eleven fatherle&s;s Children</HI> upon the Care of that God who had fed him with this <HI>Manna</HI> in his <HI>Wilderne&s;s-&s;tate.</HI> The Benefit of which <HI>Faith</HI> all his Children (none of which were in his Life-time provided for) have &s;ince experienced. And it is &s;carce to be imagined, how helpful this his Son was to his Father by his heavenly Di&s;cour&s;e, hum|ble Advice, and Prayers. After four Months Conflict with a Con&s;umption, he &s;weetly &s;lept in Je&s;us.</P>
<P>After the Death of his Father, he did what he could to &s;upply his Ab&s;ence, doing the Part of a Hu&s;band, Son, and Brother: So that he was no &s;mall Comfort to his poor Mother in her di&s;con&s;olate State, and all
<PB N="15" REF="14">
the re&s;t of his Relations, that had any Sen&s;e of God upon their Spirits. To one of which he thus addre&s;|&s;eth him&s;elf, upon the Death of a &s;weet Child.</P>
<Q><P>He that in Afflictions would find Comfort, mu&s;t &s;trive to &s;ee &s;piritual Comforts to be the greate&s;t, even that Comfort which is from God, in the Face of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t; this, this will be a Cordial; this will be as Marrow and Fatne&s;s to the Soul. They who have an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, what need they be moved with any worldly Trouble: Is not Chri&s;t better than ten Children? Is not his loving Kindne&s;s better than Life? Is not all the World a Shadow compared with one Hour's Enjoyment of him, even on this Side of Glory. O therefore &s;trive to get your Intere&s;t in this Comfort &s;ecured, and then all's well. He that hath Chri&s;t hath all things. If God be reconciled to you through him, then he will with-hold no good Thing from you.</P>
<P>We poor fooli&s;h Creatures do &s;carce know what is good for our&s;elves, but it's no &s;mall Encourage|ment to the People of God, that Wi&s;dom it&s;elf takes Care of them, and one who loves them better than they love them&s;elves <HI>looks after them; and he hath given his Promi&s;e for it,</HI> that all &s;hall work together for their Good. And what better Foundation of Com|fort can there be in the whole World than this?</P></Q>
<P>Let this &s;erve as a Remedy again&s;t exce&s;&s;ive Grief. Get your Love to God increa&s;ed, which if you do, the Love of all other Things will wax cold. And if you have given God your Heart, you will give him Leave to take what he will that is yours, and what he hath you will judge rather well kept than lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Remember that Scripture, and let it have its due Im|pre&s;&s;ion upon your Spirit; <HI>He that loves Father or Mo|ther, Brother or Si&s;ter, yea, or Children more than me, is not worthy of me.</HI> O labour to have your Affections therefore more rai&s;ed up to him who is mo&s;t worthy of them, let him have the uppermo&s;t Room in your Heart, and let your Love to all other Things be placed in Subjection to your Love of God, be ruled by it, and directed to it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> His Return to King's-College after his Father's Death, and his Temptations from Satan.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN his Father was dead he returned again to <HI>King's-College,</HI> and was a Member of a &s;e|cret Society, which began to plot how they might be&s;t improve their Gifts and Graces &s;o as to be &s;erviceable to God and their Generations. Their Cu&s;tom was frequently to meet together; to pray and to communi|cate <HI>Studies</HI> and <HI>Experiences.</HI> Some of this Company did degenerate, but others lived to let the World un|der&s;tand, that what they did was from a <HI>vital Princi|ple:</HI> Among&s;t whom, this young Man was none of the <HI>lea&s;t.</HI> One of their De&s;igns was to engage the <HI>Juni|ors,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, before they were en&s;nared by wicked Company, when they came fre&s;h from <HI>School.</HI> After &s;ome time, mo&s;t of his dear Companions were <HI>tran&s;|planted</HI> either into Gentlemens Families or Livings, and Mr. <HI>Janeway,</HI> being one of the younge&s;t, was, for a while, left alone in the <HI>College.</HI> But he wanting the comfortable Diver&s;ion of &s;uitable Society, fixed &s;o inten&s;ely upon his Studies, that he &s;oon gave &s;uch a Wound to his bodily Con&s;titution, as could never be throughly healed.</P>
<P>Thus you have a Ta&s;te of his Spirit, and may per|ceive what it was that he had his Heart &s;et upon, what kept his Graces in &s;uch Vigour and Activity, and how de&s;irous he was that others &s;hould be Sharers with him in this Mercy: Yet, for all this, he had his gloomy Days, and the Sun was &s;ometimes over-ca&s;t, his Sweets were &s;ometimes imbittered with dreadful and horrid Temptations. The Devil &s;hot his poi|&s;onous Arrows at him; yet through the Captain of his Salvation, he came more than a Conqueror out of the Field. He was with <HI>Paul,</HI> many times <HI>lifted up into the third Heavens, and &s;aw and heard Things unutterable:
<PB N="17" REF="16">
But le&s;t he &s;hould be exalted above Mea&s;ure, there was a Me&s;&s;enger of Satan &s;ent to buffet him.</HI></P>
<P>It would make a Chri&s;tian's Heart even ake to hear what &s;trange Temptations he was exerci&s;ed with. But he was well armed for &s;uch a Conflict, having on the Shield of Faith, whereby he quenched the fiery Darts of that wicked One: Yet, this Fight co&s;t him the Sweating of his very Body for Agonies of Spirit; and Tears and &s;trong Cries to Heaven for fre&s;h Help&punc; As for him&s;elf he was wont to take an Arrow out of God's Quiver, and di&s;charge it by Faith and Prayer, for the Di&s;comfiture of his violent Enemy, who at la&s;t was fain to fly.</P>
<P>The&s;e Temptations and Conflicts with Satan, did not a little help him in his Dealing with one that was &s;orely afflicted with the like Temptations. And be|cau&s;e I judge it may be of U&s;e to &s;uch, I in&s;ert a Let|ter of his to one in the like Ca&s;e.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<Q><P>YOU &s;ay that you are troubled with bla&s;phe|mous Thoughts: So then, though they are bla&s;phemous, yet they are your Trouble; and nei|ther &s;ent for, nor welcome; and &s;o are not a&s;&s;ented to in your Mind. What then &s;hall we think of them? If they were your own Production, your Heart would be delighted in its own I&s;&s;ue, but you do nothing le&s;s. Sure then they are the Injections of that wicked one, who is the Accu&s;er of the Brethren, and the Di&s;turber of the Peace of the People of God. But doth Satan u&s;e to employ tho&s;e Weapons but again&s;t tho&s;e that he is in fear of lo&s;ing? He is not wont to a&s;&s;ault and fight again&s;t his &s;ure&s;t Friends in this Manner. Tho&s;e that he hath fa&s;t in his own Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, he leads on as &s;oftly and quietly as he can; fearing le&s;t &s;uch Di&s;turbance &s;hould make them look about them, and &s;o they &s;hould awake, and &s;ee their Danger: But as for tho&s;e that have in &s;ome Mea&s;ure e&s;caped his Snares, he follows them hard, with all the Di&s;couragements he can. The&s;e Things
<PB N="18" REF="17">
are no other but a bitter Reli&s;h of tho&s;e Things, which you know to be bitter, after that you have ta&s;ted how good the Lord is. What then &s;hall I call the&s;e Motions of your Mind? They are the Soul's Loathing of the Mor&s;els which Satan would have it to &s;wallow down: But you will &s;ay, If the&s;e horri|ble Thoughts be not your Sin, yet they are your Mi|&s;ery, and you de&s;ire to be freed from them. And you will a&s;k, How &s;hall I get free from them? <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> See that you po&s;&s;e&s;s your Soul in Patience: And know this, that God hath an over-ruling Hand in all this: And wait upon him, for he can and will bring forth Good out of all this Evil. At pre&s;ent you &s;ee no Light: Yet, <HI>Tru&s;t in the Lord, and &s;tay your&s;elf upon your God.</HI> Can Chri&s;t forget the Purcha&s;e of his own Blood? <HI>Can a Mother forget her &s;uckling Child?</HI> Yet, <HI>God cannot forget his.</HI> God hath gracious Intents in all this, and his Bowels yearn towards you. Yea, our Saviour &s;uffers with us, through his ardent Love by Sympathy, as well as he hath &s;uffered for us. And you know he hath all Power in his Hand, who doth imploy this Power in a Way of Love towards his. This Power is made yours through the Prayer of Faith: But for your own Work, do this.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Let not &s;uch Thoughts have any Time of A|bode in your Mind, but turn them out with all the Abhorrence you can; but not with &s;o much Trouble and Di&s;turbance of Mind as I believe you do. For by this the Devil is plea&s;ed, and makes you your own Tormentor.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Always divert your Thoughts to &s;ome good Thing, and let tho&s;e very Injections be con|&s;tantly the Occa&s;ion of your more &s;piritual Medita|tion. Think the quite contrary, or fall a praying with Earne&s;tne&s;s; and the Devil will be weary if he find his De&s;igns thus broken, and that tho&s;e Sparks of Hell (which he &s;truck into the Soul to kindle and inflame Corruption,) do put Warmth into Grace, and &s;et Faith and Prayer a Working. Thus re&s;i&s;t him, and he will flee from you.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18"><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Con&s;ider that this is no new Thing: For, we are not in this ignorant of Satan's Devi&s;es, that, if any Soul hath e&s;caped out of the Chains of Dark|ne&s;s, if he will have Heaven, he &s;hall have it with as much Trouble, as the Devil can lay on; and, if he and his had their Wills, no good Man &s;hould have one peaceable Hour: But, Ble&s;&s;ed be God, the Devil cannot pluck us out of tho&s;e Almighty Arms, with which he doth embrace his dear Children.</P></Q>

<P>His Love to Chri&s;t and Souls, made him very de|&s;irous <HI>to &s;pend, and be &s;pent in the Work of the Mini&s;try;</HI> accordingly he did comply with the fir&s;t loud and clear Call to preach the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel; and tho' he was but two and twenty Years old, yet he came to that Work like one that under&s;tood what Kind of Em|ployment Preaching was. He was a Workman that needed not to be a&s;hamed, that was throughly fur|ni&s;hed for every good Word and Work; one that was able to an&s;wer Gain&s;ayers, one in whom the <HI>Word of God dwelt richly;</HI> one full of the Spirit and Power, one that hated Sin with a perfect Hatred, and loved Holine&s;s with all his Soul; in whom Religion in its Beauty did &s;hine; one that knew <HI>the Terrors of the Lord,</HI> and knew how to be&s;eech Sinners <HI>in Chri&s;t's Stead to be reconciled unto God:</HI> One that was <HI>a Son of Thunder,</HI> and <HI>a Son of Con&s;olation.</HI> In a Word, I may &s;peak that of him which <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of <HI>Timothy,</HI> that <HI>I knew none like minded, that did naturally care for Souls</HI> And had he lived to have preached often, Oh what U&s;e might &s;uch a Man have been of in his Ge|neration: One, in whom Learning and Holine&s;s did as it were &s;trive which &s;hould excell. He never preach|ed publickly but twice, and then he came to it, as if he had been u&s;ed to that Work forty Years; deliver|ing the Word of God with that Power and Maje&s;ty,
<PB N="20" REF="19">
with that Tenderne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion, with what Rea|dine&s;s and Freedom, that it made his Hearers amazed. He was lead into the My&s;tery of the Go&s;pel, and he &s;poke nothing to others but what was the Language of his Heart, and the Fruit of great Experience, and which one might ea&s;ily perceive had no &s;mall Im|pre&s;&s;ion fir&s;t upon his own Spirits.</P>
<P>His <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>la&s;t</HI> Sermons were upon Communion and intimate Conver&s;e with God, out of <HI>Job</HI> xxii. 21. A Subject that few Chri&s;tians under Heaven were better able to manage than him&s;elf, and that &s;carce any could handle &s;o feelingly as he: For he did for &s;ome con&s;iderable time maintain &s;uch an intimate Familiarity with God, that he &s;eemed to conver&s;e with Him as one Friend doth conver&s;e with another. This Text he made &s;ome Entrance into, whil&s;t he was here: But the perfecting of his Acquaintance with God was a Work fitter for another World.</P>
<P>He was one that kept an exact Watch over his Thoughts, Words and Actions, and made a Review of all that pa&s;&s;ed him, at lea&s;t once a Day, in a &s;olemn Manner. He kept a <HI>Diary,</HI> in which he did write down every Evening what the Frame of his Spirit had been all the Day long, e&s;pecially in every Duty. He took Notice what Profit he received in his &s;piritual Traffick; what Returns from that far Country; what An&s;wers of Prayer, what Deadne&s;s and Flatne&s;s, and what ob&s;ervable Providences did pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and the Sub&s;tance of what he had been doing; and any Wandrings of Thoughts, Inordinancy in any Pa&s;&s;ion; which, though the World could not di&s;cern, he could. It cannot be conceived by them which do not practi&s;e the &s;ame, to what a good Account this turn'd. This made him retain a grateful Remembrance of Mercy, and live in a con&s;tant adoring of Divine Goodne&s;s; this brought him to a very intimate Ac|quaintance with his own Heart; this kept his Spirit low, and fitted him for free Communications with God; this made him more lively and active; this helped him to walk humbly with God; this made him
<PB N="21" REF="20">
&s;peak more affectionately and experimentally to others of the Things of God. And in a Word, this left a &s;weet Calm upon his Spirits, becau&s;e he every Night made even his Accounts; and if his Sheets &s;hould prove his Winding-&s;heet, it had been all one; for he could &s;ay, his Work was done; &s;o that Death could not &s;urprize him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> An Account of the latter Part of his Life.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the latter Part of his Life, he lived like a Man that was quite weary of the World, and that looked upon him&s;elf as a Stranger here, and liv|ed in the con&s;tant Sight of a better. He plainly declared him&s;elf but a Pilgrim that looked for a bet|ter Country, a City that had Foundations, who&s;e Builder and Maker was God. His Habit, his Lan|guage, his Deportment, all &s;poke him one of another World. His Meditations were &s;o inten&s;e, long, and frequent, that they ripened him apace for Heaven, but &s;omewhat weakened his Body. Few Chri&s;tians attain to &s;uch a holy Contempt of the World, and to &s;uch clear, joyful, con&s;tant Apprehen&s;ions of the tran&s;cen|dent Glories of the un&s;een World.</P>
<P>He made it his whole Bu&s;ine&s;s to keep up &s;en&s;ible Communion with God, and to grow into an humble Familiarity with God, and to maintain it. And if by rea&s;on of Company, or any nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s, this was in any Mea&s;ure interrupted, he would complain like one out of his Element, till his Spirit was recover|ed into a delightful, unmixed, free Intercour&s;e with God. He was never &s;o well &s;atisfied, as when he was more immediately engaged in what brought him nearer to God; and by this he con&s;tantly enjoyed tho&s;e Comforts, which others rarely meet with. His Graces and Experiences toward his End grew to A&s;toni&s;hment. His Faith got up to a full A&s;&s;urance; his De&s;ires into
<PB N="22" REF="21">
a kind of Enjoyment. He was oft brought into the Banquetting-hou&s;e, and there Chri&s;t's Banner over him was Love; and he &s;ate down under his Shadow with great Delight, and his Fruit was plea&s;ant unto his Ta&s;te. His Eyes beheld the King in his Beauty, and while he &s;ate at his Table, his Spikenard did &s;end forth its plea&s;ant Smell: He had frequent Vi&s;ions of Glory, lay in the Bo&s;om of his Ma&s;ter, and was &s;ure|ly a very beloved Di&s;ciple, and highly favoured. His Lord oft call'd him up to the Mount to him, and let him &s;ee his excellent Glory. O the &s;weet Fore-ta&s;te that he had of tho&s;e Plea&s;ures that are at the right Hand of God! How oft was he fea&s;ted with the Fea&s;t of fat Things, tho&s;e Wines on the Lees well refined; and &s;ometimes he was like a Giant refre&s;h'd with new Wine, rejoicing to run the Race that was &s;et before him, whether of doing or of &s;uffering. He was even &s;ick of Love, and he could &s;ay to the poor unexperi|enced World, <HI>O ta&s;te and &s;ee!</HI> and to Chri&s;tians, <HI>Come and I will tell you what God hath done for my Soul.</HI> O what do Chri&s;tians mean that they do no more to get their Sen&s;es &s;piritually exerci&s;ed? O why do they not make Religion the very Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Lives? O why is the Soul, Chri&s;t and Glory thus de&s;pi&s;ed? Is there nothing in Communion with God? Are all tho&s;e Comforts of Chri&s;tians, that follow hard after him worth Nothing? Is it not worth the while to make one's Calling and Election &s;ure? O why do Men and Women je&s;t and dally in the great Matter of E|ternity? Little do People think what they &s;light, when they are &s;eldom and formal in &s;ecret Duties, and when they neglect the great Duty of <HI>Meditation,</HI> which I have through rich Mercy found &s;o &s;weet and refre&s;hing: O what do Chri&s;tians mean, that they keep at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from a Chri&s;t? Did they but know the thou&s;andth Part of that Sweetne&s;s which is in him, they could not choo&s;e but follow him hard; they would run, and not be weary; and walk, and not be faint.</P>
<P>He could &s;en&s;ibly and experimentally commend the
<PB N="23" REF="22">
Ways of God to the poor unexperienced World, and &s;ay, <HI>his Ways are Plea&s;antne&s;s;</HI> and ju&s;tify Wi&s;dom, and &s;ay, <HI>her Paths were Peace.</HI> He could take off tho&s;e A&s;per&s;ions, which the Devil and the World ca&s;t upon Godline&s;s in the Power of it. Here is one that could challenge all the Athei&s;ts in the World to di&s;|pute; here is one that could bring &s;en&s;ible Demon|&s;trations to prove a Deity, and the Reality and Ex|cellencies of Invi&s;ibles; which the&s;e Fools and Mad|men make the Subject of their Scorn: Here is one that would not change Delights with the greate&s;t E|picures living, and vie Plea&s;ure with all the Sen&s;ua|li&s;ts of the World. Which of them all could in the Mid&s;t of their Jollity &s;ay, <HI>This is the Plea&s;ure that &s;hall la&s;t for ever?</HI> Which of them can &s;ay among their Cups, <HI>I can now look Death in the Face,</HI> and, <HI>this very Moment I can be content,</HI> yea glad, <HI>to leave the&s;e Delights, as knowing I &s;hall enjoy better.</HI> And this he could do, when he fared deliciou&s;ly in &s;piritual Ban|quets every Day: He could upon better Rea&s;on than he did, &s;ay, <HI>Soul, thou ha&s;t Goods laid up for many Years:</HI> He knew full well, that what he did here en|joy, was but a little to what he &s;hould have &s;hortly. <HI>In his Pre&s;ence there is Fulne&s;s of Joy; at his right Hand there are Plea&s;ures for evermore.</HI> Where is the <HI>Bel|&s;hazzar</HI> that would not quake in the mid&s;t of his Cups, whil&s;t he is quaffing the riche&s;t Wine, if he &s;hould &s;ee a Hand upon the Wall writing bitter things again&s;t him, telling him, that this Night his Soul mu&s;t be required of him, that now he mu&s;t come away, and give an Account of all his ungodly Plea&s;ures, be|fore the mighty God? Where is the Sinner that could be contented to hear the Lord roaring out of <HI>Zion,</HI> whil&s;t he is roaring in the Tavern? Which of them would be glad to hear the Trumpet &s;ound, and to hear that Voice, <HI>Ari&s;e ye Dead and come to Judgment?</HI> Which of them would rejoice to &s;ee the Mountains quake, the Elements melting with fervent Heat, and the Earth con&s;umed with Flames; and the Lord Chri&s;t whom they de&s;pi&s;ed, coming in the Clouds with Millions of

his Saints and Angels, to be avenged upon tho&s;e that knew not God, and obeyed not his Go&s;pel? Is not that a ble&s;&s;ed State, when a Man can lift up his Head with Joy, when others tremble with Fear, and &s;ink with Sorrow! And this was the Condition of this holy young Man. In the mid&s;t of all worldly Com|forts he longed for Death; and the Thoughts of the Day of Judgment made all his Enjoyments &s;weeter. O, how did he long for the Coming of Chri&s;t! Whil&s;t &s;ome have been di&s;cour&s;ing by him of that great and terrible Day of the Lord, he would &s;mile, and hum|bly expre&s;s his Delight in the Fore-thought of that approaching Hour.</P>
<P>I remember once there was a great Talk, that one had foretold the <HI>Dooms-day</HI> &s;hould be upon &s;uch a Day: Although he blamed their daring Folly, that would pretend to know that which was hid from the Angels them&s;elves; yet granting their Su&s;picion to be true, what then, &s;aid he? What if the Day of Judg|ment were come, as it will mo&s;t cerrainly come &s;hort|ly? If I were &s;ure the Day of Judgment were to be|gin within an Hour, I &s;hould be glad with all my Heart. If at this very in&s;tant I &s;hould hear &s;uch Thunderings, and &s;ee &s;uch Lightnings, as <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did at Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> I am per&s;uaded my very Heart would leap for Joy. Through infinite Mercy, the very Me|ditation of that Day hath even ravi&s;hed my Soul, and the Thought of the Certainty and Nearne&s;s of it is more refre&s;hing to me than the Comforts of the whole World. Surely nothing can more revive my Spirits than to behold the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, the Joy, Life, and Beauty of my Soul. Would it not more rejoice me than <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Waggons did old <HI>Jacob?</HI> I lately dreamed that the Day of Judgment was come. Me|thought I heard terrible Cracks of Thunder, and &s;aw dreadful Lightnings; the Foundations of the Earth did &s;hake, and the Heavens were rolled together as a Garment; yea, all Things vi&s;ible were in a Flame; methought I &s;aw the Graves opened, and the Earth and Sea giving up their Dead; methought I &s;aw Mil|lions

of Angels, and Chri&s;t coming in the Clouds: Methought I beheld the Ancient of Days &s;itting upon his Throne, and all other Thrones ca&s;t down. Me|thought I beheld him who&s;e Garments were white as Snow, and the Hair of his Head like pure Wool: His Throne was like the fiery Flame, and his Wheels as burning Fire; a fiery Stream i&s;&s;ued and came forth from him; thou&s;ands of ten thou&s;ands mini&s;tred unto him; and ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and &s;tood be|fore him; and the Judgment was &s;et, and the Books were opened. O with what an Exta&s;y of Joy was I &s;urprized! Methought it was the mo&s;t heart-rai&s;ing Sight that ever my Eyes beheld: And then I cried out, <HI>I have waited for thy Salvation, O God;</HI> and &s;o I mounted into the Air, to meet my Lord in the Clouds.</P>
<P>This I record, only to &s;hew, how far he was from being daunted at the Thoughts of Death or Judg|ment: And to let other Chri&s;tians know what is at|tainable in this Life; and what Folly it is, for us to take up with &s;o little, when our Lord is plea&s;ed to make &s;uch noble Provi&s;ions for us, and by wi&s;e and diligent Improvement of tho&s;e Means which God hath offered us, we may have an Entrance admini&s;tred to us abundantly into the everla&s;ting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Oh how comfortable, how honourable, and how profitable is this State! The&s;e are your Men that quit them&s;elves like Chri&s;tians. This is true Gallantry, noble Manhood, real Valour! This was the Condi|tion of Mr. <HI>Janeway</HI> for about three Years before he died. I will not deny but that he had &s;ome Clouds; but he u&s;ually walked in a &s;weet, even, humble Sere|nity of Spirit; and though he daily que&s;tioned many Actions, yet did he not que&s;tion his State, but had his Heart fixed upon that Rock that neither Waves nor Winds could &s;hake. His Sen&s;es were &s;till &s;o &s;piritu|ally exerci&s;ed, as that he could look up to Heaven as his Country and Inheritance, and to God as his Father, and to Chri&s;t as his Redeemer; and (that which is &s;carce to be heard of) he counted it the high|e&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="25">
Act of Patience to be willing to live, and a very great Self-denial to be contented to be in this World, and to dwell in this Side a full and eternal Enjoyment of that royal glorious One whom his Soul was &s;o much in love with.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> His la&s;t Sickne&s;s, and Death.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Body is now &s;haken again, and he falls into a deep Con&s;umption; but, this Me&s;&s;enger of God did not in the lea&s;t damp him. Spitting of Blood was no gha&s;tly thing to one that had his Eye upon the Blood of Je&s;us; faint Sweats did not daunt him that had always &s;uch revival Cordials at hand. It's mat|ter of Joy to him, that he was now in &s;ome Hopes of having his earne&s;t De&s;ires &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>After he had been a while &s;ick, a &s;udden Dimne&s;s &s;eized upon his Eyes: By and by his Sight quite failed; and there was &s;uch a vi&s;ible Alteration in him, that he and others judged the&s;e things to be the Symptoms of Death approaching. But when he was thus taken, he was not in the lea&s;t &s;urprized; but was lifted up with Joy to think what a Life he was going to, looking upon Death it&s;elf as one of his Father's Servants, and his Friends, that was &s;ent as a Me&s;&s;en|ger to conduct him &s;afely to his glorious Palace.</P>
<P>When he felt his Body ready to faint, he called to his Mother, and &s;aid, <Q>Dear Mother, I am dying, but I be&s;eech you be not troubled; for I am, through Mercy, quite above the Fears of Death; It's no great Matter, I have nothing troubles me but the Apprehen&s;ions of your Grief. I am going to him whom I love above Life.</Q></P>
<P>But it plea&s;ed the Lord to rai&s;e him again a little out of his fainting Fit, for his Ma&s;ter had yet more Work for him to do before he mu&s;t receive his Wages. Although his outward Man decayed apace, yet he is
<PB N="27" REF="26">
renew'd in the inward Man Day by Day: His Graces were never more active, and his Experiences never greater. When one would have thought, he &s;hould have been taken up with his Di&s;temper, and that it had been enough for him to grapple with his Pains, he quite forgets his Weakne&s;s; and is &s;o &s;wallowed up of the Life to come, that he had &s;carce Lei&s;ure to think of his Sickne&s;s.</P>
<P>For &s;everal Weeks together, I never heard the lea&s;t Word that favoured with any Complaint or Wearine&s;s under the Hand of God, except his eager De&s;ire to be with Chri&s;t be counted Complaining, and his Ha&s;te to be in Heaven, Impatience. Now was the time when one might have &s;een Heaven and the Glory of another World realized to Sen&s;e. His Faith grew exceeding|ly, and his Life was proportionable, and his Joys were equal to both.</P>
<P>O the rare Attainments! The high and divine Ex|pre&s;&s;ions that dropped from his Mouth! I have not Words to expre&s;s what a &s;trange, triumphant, angelical Frame, he was in, for &s;ome con&s;iderable Time toge|ther. It was a very Heaven upon Earth, to hear and &s;ee a Man admiring God at &s;uch a rate. Tho&s;e that did not &s;ee, cannot well conceive, what a &s;weet Frame he was in, for at lea&s;t &s;ix Weeks before he died. His Soul was almo&s;t always filled with tho&s;e Joys un&s;peak|able and full of Glory. How oft would he cry out, <HI>Oh that I could let you know what I now feel! Oh, that I could &s;hew you what I &s;ee! Oh, that I could expre&s;s the thou&s;andth Part of that Sweetne&s;s that I now find in Chri&s;t! You would all think it then well worth the while to make it your Bu&s;ine&s;s to be religious.</HI> Oh my dear Friends, we little think what Chri&s;t is worth upon a Death-bed. I would not for a World, nay for Milli|ons of Worlds, be now without Chri&s;t and a Pardon. I would not for a World be to live any longer: The very Thoughts of a Po&s;&s;ibility of Recovery, makes me tremble.</P>
<P>When one came to vi&s;it him, and told him, that he hoped it might plea&s;e God to rai&s;e him again, and
<PB N="28" REF="27">
that he had &s;een many a weaker Man re&s;tored to Health, and that lived many a good Year after: <HI>And do you think to plea&s;e me</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>by &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e as this?</HI> No, Friend, you are much mi&s;taken in me, if you think that the Thoughts of Life, and Health, and the World, are plea&s;ing to me. The World hath quite lo&s;t its Excellency in my Judgment. O how poor and contemptible a thing it is in all its Glory, compared with the Glory of that invi&s;ible World which I now live in the Sight of! And as for Life, Chri&s;t is my Life, Health, and Strength; and I know, I &s;hall have another kind of Life, when I leave this. I tell you it would incomparably more plea&s;e me, if you &s;hould &s;ay to me, [You are no Man of this World; you cannot po&s;&s;ibly hold out long; before To-morrow you will be in Eternity] I tell you I do &s;o long to be with Chri&s;t, that I could be contented to be cut in Pie|ces, and to be put to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Torments, &s;o I might but die, and be with Chri&s;t. Oh, how &s;weet is Je&s;us! <HI>Come Lord Je&s;us, come quickly.</HI> Death do thy wor&s;t! Death hath lo&s;t its terriblene&s;s. Death, it is nothing. I &s;ay, Death is nothing (through Grace) to me. I can as ea&s;ily die as &s;hut my Eyes, to turn my Head and &s;leep: <HI>I long to be with Chri&s;t; I long to die.</HI></P>
<P>His Mother and Brethren &s;tanding by him, he &s;aid, <Q><HI>Dear Mother,</HI> I be&s;eech you earne&s;tly as ever I de&s;ir|ed any thing of you in my Life, that you would chear|fully give me up to Chri&s;t; do not hinder me, now I am going to Re&s;t and Glory. I am afraid of your Prayers, le&s;t they pull one way, and mine another.</Q></P>
<P>And then turning to his Brethren, he &s;peak thus to them; <Q>I charge you all, do not pray for my Life any more: you do me wrong, if you do. Oh that Glo|ry, the un&s;peakable Glory that I behold. My Heart is full, my Heart is full. Chri&s;t &s;miles and I cannot chu&s;e but &s;mile: Can you find in your Heart to &s;top me, who am now going to the compleat and eternal Enjoyment of Chri&s;t? Would you keep me from my Crown? The Arms of my ble&s;&s;ed Saviour are open to embrace me; the Angels &s;tand ready to
<PB N="29" REF="28">
carry my Soul into his Bo&s;om. Oh, did you but &s;ee what I &s;ee, you would all cry out with me, how long, dear Lord; come Lord Je&s;us, come quickly!</Q> Oh, why are his Chariot-wheels &s;o long a coming.</P>
<P>And all this while he lay like a triumphing Con|queror, &s;miling and rejoicing in Spirit.</P>
<P>There was never a Day towards his End but (as weak as he was) he did &s;ome &s;pecial Piece of Service, for his great Ma&s;ter. Yea, almo&s;t every Hour did produce fre&s;h Wonders.</P>
<P>A judicious and holy Mini&s;ter came often to vi&s;it him, and di&s;cour&s;ed with him of the Excellency of Chri&s;t, and the Glory of the invi&s;ible World. <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I feel &s;omething of it; my Heart is as full as it can hold in this lower State; I can hold no more here. Oh that I could let you know what I feel!</HI></P>
<P>This holy Mini&s;ter praying with him, his Soul was ravi&s;hed with the abundant Incomes of Light, Life, and Love; &s;o that he could &s;carce bear it, nor the Thoughts of &s;taying any longer in the World, but longed to be in &s;uch a Condition, wherein he &s;hould have yet more Grace, and more Comfort, and be better able to bear that Weight of Glory; &s;ome Ma|nife&s;tations whereof did even almo&s;t &s;ink his we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k Body, and had he not been &s;u&s;tained by a great Power, his very Joys would have overwhelmed him; and whil&s;t he was in the&s;e Exta&s;ies of Joy and Love, he was wont to cry out:</P>
<P>'Who am I Lord, who am I, that thou &s;hould&s;t be mindful of me! Why me, Lord, why me? Oh, what &s;hall I &s;ay unto thee, O thou Pre&s;erver of Men? O why me, Lord, why me? If thou wilt look up|on &s;uch a poor Worm, who can hinder! Who would not love thee! Oh ble&s;&s;ed Father! Oh how &s;weet and gracious ha&s;t thou been unto me!'</P>
<P>And thus he went on, admiring and adoring of God, in a more high and heavenly Manner than I can cloath with Words. Suppo&s;e what you can on this &s;ide Heaven; and I am per&s;uaded you might have &s;een it in him. He was wonderfully taken with the
<PB N="30" REF="29">
Goodne&s;s of God to him, in &s;ending that aged expe|rienced Mini&s;ter to help him in his la&s;t great Work upon Earth. <Q>Who am I, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that God &s;hould &s;end to me a Me&s;&s;enger one among a Thou&s;and.</Q></P>
<P>Though he was towards his End, mo&s;t commonly in a triumphant joyful Frame; yet &s;ometimes, even then, he had &s;ome &s;mall Intermi&s;&s;ions in which he would cry out, <HI>Hold out, Faith and Patience; yet a lit|tle while and your Work is done.</HI> And when he found not his Heart wound up to the highe&s;t Pitch of Thank|fulne&s;s, Admiration and Love, he would with great Sorrow bemoan him&s;elf, and cry out in this Lan|guage:</P>
<Q>And what's the Matter now, Oh my Soul, what wilt thou? can&s;t thou thus unworthily &s;light this ad|mirable and a&s;toni&s;hing Conde&s;cen&s;ion of God to thee? Seems it a &s;mall Matter that the great <HI>Jeho|vah</HI> &s;hould deal thus familiarly with this Worm; and wilt thou pa&s;s this over, as a common Mercy? What meane&s;t thou, Oh my Soul, that thou do&s;t not con&s;tantly adore and prai&s;e this rare, &s;trong, and un&s;peakable Love! Is it true, Oh my Soul? Doth God deal familiarly with Man? And are his humble, zealous, and con&s;tant Love, Prai&s;e, and Service too good for God? Why are not thou, Oh my Soul, &s;wallowed up every Moment with this free unparallel'd everla&s;ting Love?</Q>
<P>And then he breaks out again into another trium|phant Exta&s;y of Prai&s;e and Joy; and expre&s;&s;ed a lit|tle of that which was unexpre&s;&s;ibly in &s;ome &s;uch Words as the&s;e:</P>
<Q>Stand a&s;toni&s;hed ye Heavens, and wonder O ye Angels, at this infinite Grace! Was ever any under Heaven more beholding to free Grace than I? Doth God u&s;e to do thus with his Creatures? Ad|mire him for ever and ever, Oh ye redeemed ones! Oh tho&s;e Joys, the Ta&s;te of which I have! The everla&s;ting Joys, which are at his right Hand for evermore! Eternity, Eternity it&s;elf is too &s;hort to prai&s;e this God in. O ble&s;s the Lord with me,
<PB N="31" REF="30">
come let us &s;hort for Joy, and boa&s;t in the God of our Salvation. Oh, help me to prai&s;e the Lord, for his Mercy endureth for ever.</Q>
<P>One of his Brethren (that had formerly been wrought upon by his holy Exhortations and Example) praying with him, and &s;eeing of him (as he apprehended) near his Di&s;&s;olution, de&s;ired that the Lord would be plea&s;ed to continue tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing Comforts to the la&s;t Mo|ments of his Breath, and that he might go from one Heaven to another, from Grace and Joy imperfect, to perfect Grace and Glory; and when his Work was done here, give him, if it were his Will, the mo&s;t ea&s;y and triumphant Pa&s;&s;age to Re&s;t.</P>
<P>At the End of the Duty, he bur&s;t out into a won|derful Pa&s;&s;ion of Joy. (Sure that was Joy un&s;peaka|ble and full of Glory!) Oh, what an <HI>Amen</HI> did he &s;peak, <HI>Amen, Amen, Amen, Hallelujah.</HI></P>
<P>It would have made any Chri&s;tian's Heart to leap, to have &s;een and heard what &s;ome &s;aw and heard at that time; and I que&s;tion not, but that it would &s;ome|what affect them to hear and read it; though it be &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to &s;peak the half of what was admirable in him: For, it being &s;o much beyond Precedent, it did even a&s;toni&s;h and amaze tho&s;e of us that were a|bout him, that our Relation mu&s;t fall hugely &s;hort of what was real.</P>
<P>I verily believe that it exceeds the highe&s;t Rhetorick, to &s;et out to the Life, what this heavenly Creature did then deliver. I want Words to &s;peak, and &s;o did he, for he &s;aw Things unutterable: But yet, &s;o much he &s;peak, as ju&s;tly drew the Admiration of all that &s;aw him. He talked as if he had been in the third Hea|ven, and broke out in &s;uch Words as the&s;e:</P>
<Q><P>Oh, He is come! He is come! Oh how &s;weet! How glorious is the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us! How &s;hall I do to &s;peak the thou&s;andth Part of his Prai&s;es! Oh for Words, to &s;et out a little of that Excellency! But it is un|expre&s;&s;ible! Oh how excellent, glorious and lovely is the precious Je&s;us! He is &s;weet, he is altogether lovely! And now I am &s;ick of Love, he hath ra|vi&s;hed
<PB N="32" REF="31">
my Soul with his Beauty! I &s;hall die &s;ick of Love!</P>
<P>Oh my Friends, &s;tand by and wonder, come look upon a dying Man, and wonder; I cannot my&s;elf but &s;tand and wonder! Was there ever a greater Kindne&s;s, was there ever &s;en&s;ibler Manife&s;tations of rich Grace! Oh, why me Lord! why me! Sure this is akin to Heaven, and if I were never to enjoy any more than this, it were well worth all the Torments that Men and Devils could invent, to come through even a Hell to &s;uch tran&s;cendent Joys as the&s;e. If this be dying, dying is &s;weet: Let no true Chri&s;tians ever be afraid of dying. Oh Death is &s;weet to me. This Bed is &s;oft. Chri&s;t's Arms and Ki&s;&s;es, his Smiles and Vi&s;its, &s;ure they would turn Hell into Heaven Oh that you did but &s;ee and feel what I do! Come and behold a dying Man more chearful than ever you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w any healthful Man in the Mid&s;t of his &s;weete&s;t Enjoyments. Oh Sirs, worldly Plea|&s;ures are pitiful, poor, &s;orry Things, compared with one Glimp&s;e of this Glory, which &s;hines &s;o &s;trongly into my Soul! Oh why &s;hould any of you be &s;o &s;ad, when I am &s;o glad: This, this is the Hour that I have waited for.</P></Q>
<P>About eight and forty Hours before his Death, his Eyes were dim, and his Sight much failed; his Jaws &s;hook and trembled, and his Feet were cold, and all the Symptoms of Death were upon him, and his ex|tream Parts were already almo&s;t dead and &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and yet, even then, his Joys were (if po&s;&s;ible) greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; He had &s;o many Fits of Joy un&s;peakable, that he &s;eem'd to be in one continued Act of Seraphick Love, and Prai&s;e. He &s;peak like one that was ju&s;t entering into the Gates of the <HI>New Jeru&s;alem:</HI> The greate&s;t Part of him was now in Heaven; not a Word dropt from his Mouth but it breathed Chri&s;t and Heaven. Oh what Encouragement did he give to them which did &s;tand by, to follow Chri&s;t in an humble, believing, zealous Cour&s;e of Life, adding one Degree of Grace to another, and u&s;ing all Dili|gence
<PB N="33" REF="32">
to make their Calling and Election &s;ure; and that then, they al&s;o &s;hould find a glorious Pa&s;&s;age into a ble&s;&s;ed Eternity.</P>
<P>But mo&s;t of his Work was <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> an hundred Times admiring of the bottomle&s;s Love of God to him. Oh, why me, Lord, why me! And then he would give In&s;tructions to them that came to &s;ee him. He was &s;carce ever &s;ilent, becau&s;e the Love of Chri&s;t and Souls did con&s;train him. There was &s;o much Work done for Chri&s;t in his la&s;t Hours, that I am rea|dy to think, he did as much in an Hour as &s;ome do in a Year.</P>
<P>Every particular Per&s;on had a faithful affectionate Warning. And that good Mini&s;ter, that was &s;o much with him, u&s;ed this as an Argument to per&s;wade him to be willing to live a little longer, and to be patient to tarry God's Lei&s;ure; &s;ure God have &s;omething for thee to do that is yet undone; &s;ome Word of Exhortation to &s;ome poor Soul, that you have forgot.</P>
<P>The Truth of it is, he was filled with the Love of Chri&s;t, that he could &s;carce bear Ab&s;ence from him a Moment. He knew that he &s;hould be capable of bearing greater Glory above, than he could here. It was the Judgment of &s;ome that were with him, that his Heart was not only habitually, but actually &s;et on God all the Day long; and nothing of human Frailty appear'd, except it were his pa&s;&s;ionate De&s;ire to die, and difficult to bring him&s;elf to be willing to &s;tay be|low Heaven.</P>
<P>He was wont every Evening to take his Leave of his Friends, hoping not to &s;ee them till the Morning of the Re&s;urrection; and he de&s;ired that they would make &s;ure of a comfortable Meeting at our Father's Hou&s;e in that other World.</P>
<P>One Pa&s;&s;age I cannot omit, which was this, That when Mini&s;ters or Chri&s;tians came to him, he would beg of them to &s;pend all the Time that they had with him in Prai&s;e. <Q>O help me to prai&s;e God, I have now nothing el&s;e to do from this Time to Eternity, but to prai&s;e and love God. I have what my Soul
<PB N="34" REF="33">
de&s;ires upon Earth; I cannot tell what to pray for, but what I have graciou&s;ly given.</Q> The Wants that are capable of &s;upplying in this World, are &s;upplied. I want but one Thing, and that is, <HI>A &s;peedy Lift to Heaven.</HI> I expect no more here, I can't de&s;ire more. I can't hear more. Oh prai&s;e, prai&s;e, prai&s;e that infi|nite boundle&s;s Love that hath, to a Wonder, looked upon my Soul. <Q>Help me, O my Friends, to prai&s;e and admire him that hath done &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing Wonders for my Soul; he hath pardoned all my Sins, he hath filled me with his Goodne&s;s, he hath given me Grace and Glory, and no good Thing hath he with-held from me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Come, help me with Prai&s;es, all's too little: Come, help me, Oh ye glorious and mighty Angels, who are &s;o well &s;kill'd in this heavenly Work of Prai&s;e. Prai&s;e him, all ye Creatures upon the Earth, let every thing that hath Being, help me to prai&s;e him. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah: Prai&s;e is now my Work, and I &s;hall be engaged in that &s;weet Employment for ever. Bring the Bible, turn to <HI>David's P&s;alms,</HI> and let us &s;ing a <HI>P&s;alm</HI> of Prai&s;e: Come let's lift up our Voice in the Prai&s;e of the mo&s;t High; I will &s;ing with you as long as my Breath doth la&s;t, and when I have none, I &s;hall do it better.</Q></P>
<P>And then turning to &s;ome of his Friends that were weeping, he de&s;ired them rather to rejoice than weep upon his Account. It may ju&s;tly &s;eem a Wonder, how he could &s;peak &s;o much as he did when he was &s;o weak; but the Joy of the Lord did &s;trengthen him.</P>
<P>In his Sickne&s;s, the Scriptures that he took much Delight in, were the fourteenth, fifteenth, &s;ixteenth and &s;eventeenth of <HI>John.</HI> The fifty fourth of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> was very refre&s;hing al&s;o to him; he would repeat that Word <HI>[with everla&s;ting Mercies will I gather]</HI> with A|bundance of Joy.</P>
<P>He commended the Study of the Promi&s;es to Be|lievers, and de&s;ired that they would be &s;ure to make good their Claim to them and then they might come to the Wells of Con&s;olation and drink thereof their Fill.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">According to his De&s;ire mo&s;t of the Time that was &s;pent with him, was &s;pent in Prai&s;e; and he would &s;till be calling out, <HI>More Prai&s;e &s;till.</HI> <Q>O help me to prai&s;e him: I have now nothing el&s;e to do; I have done with Prayer and all other Ordinances; I have almo&s;t done conver&s;ing with Mortals.

<P>Several times he &s;peak in this Language, and re|peated many of the&s;e Words often, over and over again, with far greater Affection than can be well worded. And I &s;olemnly profe&s;s, that what is here written is no Hyperbole, and that the twentieth Part of what was ob&s;ervable in him, is not recorded; we cannot word it exactly as he did, yet you have the Sub&s;tance, and many Things in his own Words, with little or no Variation.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35">The Day before his Death, he looked &s;omewhat earne&s;tly upon his Brother <HI>James,</HI> who &s;tood by him very &s;ad; of whom he judged, that he was putting up &s;ome Ejaculations to God upon his Account: <HI>I thank thee, dear Brother, for thy Love,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>thou art now praying for me, and I know thou love&s;t me dearly: But Chri&s;t loveth me ten thou&s;and times more than thou do&s;t: Come, and ki&s;s me, dear Brother, before I die:</HI> And &s;o with his cold dying Lips, he ki&s;&s;ed him, and &s;aid, <HI>I &s;hall go before, and I hope thou &s;halt follow after to Glory.</HI></P>

<P>A few Hours before his Death, he called all his Relations and Brethren together, that he might give them one &s;olemn Warning more; and ble&s;s them, and pray for them, as his Breath and Strength would give him Leave: Which he did with abundance of Au|thority, Affection, and Spirituallity: Which take briefly as it follows.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He thanked his dear Mother for her tender Love to him, and de&s;ired that &s;he might be in Travel to &s;ee Chri&s;t formed in the Souls of the re&s;t of her Children, and &s;ee of the Travel of her Soul, and meet them with Joy in that great Day.</P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> he charged all his Brethren and Si&s;ters in gene|ral, as they would an&s;wer it before God, that they &s;hould carry it dutiful to their dear Mother. And for his elde&s;t Brother <HI>William,</HI> (at who&s;e Hou&s;e he lay &s;ick) his Prayer was, that he might be &s;wallowed up of Chri&s;t, and Love to Souls; and be more and more exemplary in his Life, and &s;ucce&s;sful in his Mini&s;try, and fini&s;h his Cour&s;e with Joy.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36">His next Brother's Name was <HI>Andrew,</HI> a Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> who was with him, and &s;aw him in his tri|umphing State; but (his nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s calling him away) he could not then be by; yet he was not for|got, but he was thus ble&s;&s;ed, <HI>The God of Heaven re|member my poor Brother at</HI> London: <HI>The Lord make him truly rich in giving him the Pearl of great Price, and make him a Fellow Citizen with the Saints, and of the Hou&s;hold of God; the Lord deliver him from the Sins of that City; may the World be kept out of his Heart, and Chri&s;t dwell there. Oh that he may be as his Name is, a &s;trong Man, and that I may meet him with you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> he called his next Brother, who&s;e Name was <HI>James</HI> (whom he hoped God had made him a &s;piritual Father to) to whom he thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf; <HI>Brother</HI> James, <HI>I hope the Lord hath given thee a goodly Heritage, the Lines are fallen to thee in plea&s;ant Places; the Lord is thy Portion. I hope the Lord hath &s;hewed thee the Worth of Chri&s;t.</HI> Hold on, dear Brother; Chri&s;t, Heaven and Glory are worth &s;triving for; the Lord give thee more Abundance of his Grace.</P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> his next Brother <HI>Abraham</HI> was called, to whom he &s;peak to this Purpo&s;e, <HI>the Ble&s;&s;ing of the God of</HI> A|braham <HI>re&s;t upon thee, the Lord make thee a Father of many &s;piritual Children.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>fifth</HI> Brother was <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> whom he ble&s;&s;ed in this Manner: <HI>Let him ble&s;s thee, Oh</HI> Jo&s;eph, <HI>that ble&s;&s;|ed him that was &s;eparated from his Brethren. O that his everla&s;ting Arms may take hold on thee! It is enough, if yet thou may&s;t live in his Sight. My Heart hath been working towards thee, poor</HI> Jo&s;eph; <HI>and I am not with|out Hopes, that the Arms of the Almighty will embrace thee. The God of thy Father ble&s;s the with the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven above.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The next</HI> was his Si&s;ter <HI>Mary,</HI> to whom he &s;poke thus, <HI>Poor Si&s;ter</HI> Mary, <HI>thy Body is weak and thy Days will be filled with Bitterne&s;s; thy Name is</HI> Marah; <HI>the Lord &s;weeten all with his Grace and Peace, and give thee Health in thy Soul. Be patient, make &s;ure of Chri&s;t, and all is well.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37"><HI>Then</HI> his other Si&s;ter, who&s;e Name was <HI>Sarah,</HI> was called; whom he thus ble&s;&s;ed, <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> Sarah, <HI>thy Body is &s;trong and healthful; Oh that thy Soul may be &s;o too! The Lord make thee fir&s;t a wi&s;e Virgin, and then a Mother in</HI> I&s;rael; <HI>a Pattern of Mode&s;ty, Humility, and Holine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Then another Brother, <HI>Jacob</HI> was called, whom he ble&s;&s;ed after this Manner; <HI>The Lord make thee an I&s;ra|elite indeed, in whom there is no Guile! Oh that thou maye&s;t learn to wre&s;tle with God, and like a Prince may|e&s;t prevail, and not goe without the Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>Then he prayed for his younge&s;t Brother <HI>Benjamin,</HI> who was then but an Infant; <HI>Poor little</HI> Benjamin, <HI>O that the Father of the Fatherle&s;s, would take Care of thee, poor Child, that thou which never &s;awe&s;t thy Father upon Earth, may&s;t &s;ee him with Joy in Heaven; The Lord be thy Father, and Portion; maye&s;t thou prove the Son of thy Mother's right Hand, and the Joy of her Age.</HI></P>
<Q>O that none of us all may be found among&s;t the unconverted in the Day of Judgment! O that eve|ry one of us may appear (with our honoured Father and dear Mother) before Chri&s;t with Joy, that they may &s;ay, Lord, here are we, and the Chil|dren which thou ha&s;t given us. Oh that we may live to God here, and live with him hereafter.</Q>
<P>And now, my dear Mother, Brethren and Si&s;ters, Farewell; I leave you for a while, and I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among all them that are &s;anctified.</P>
<P>And now, dear Lord, my Work is done. I have fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e, I have fought the good Fight, and henceforth there remaineth for me a Crown of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s! Now come dear Lord Je&s;us, come quickly.</P>
<P>Then the Mini&s;ter came to give him his la&s;t Vi&s;it, and to do the Office of an inferiour Angel, to help to convey his ble&s;&s;ed Soul to Glory, who was now even upon <HI>Mount Pi&s;gah,</HI> and had a full Sight of that goodly Land at a little Di&s;tance. When this Mini&s;ter &s;pake to him, his Heart was in a mighty Flame of Love, and Joy, which drew Fears of Joy from him,
<PB N="39" REF="38">
being almo&s;t amazed to hear a Man ju&s;t a dying, talk as if he had been with <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and came from the im|mediate Pre&s;ence of God; O the Smiles that were then in his Face, and the un&s;peakable Joy that was in his Heart! one might have read <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> in his Countenance. Oh the Prai&s;e, the triumphant Prai&s;es, that he put up! And every one mu&s;t &s;peak Prai&s;e about him, or el&s;e they made a Jar in his Harmony.</P>
<P>And indeed mo&s;t did, as well as they could, help him in Prai&s;e. So that I never heard, nor knew more Prai&s;e given to God in one Room, than in his Chamber.</P>
<P>A little before he died, in the Prayer or rather Prai&s;|es, he was &s;o wrapped up with Admiration and Joy, that he could &s;carce forbear &s;houting for Joy. In the Conclu&s;ion of the Duty, with Abundance of Faith and Fervency, he &s;aid aloud, <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI></P>
<P>And now his De&s;ires will &s;oon be &s;atisfied; Death comes apace to do his Office; his Jaws are loo&s;ened more and more, and quiver greatly; his Hands and Feet are as cold as Clay, and a cold Sweat is upon him: But, Oh how glad was he when he felt his Spirit ju&s;t a going! Never was Death more welcome to any Mor|tal I think. Though the Pangs of Death were &s;trong, yet that far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory, made him indure tho&s;e bitter Pains with much Patience and Courage. In the Extremity of his Pains, he de&s;ired his elde&s;t Brother to lay him a little lower, and to take away one Pillow from him, that he might die with the more Ea&s;e: His Brother replied, that he dur&s;t not for a World, do any thing that might ha&s;ten his Death a Moment. Then he was well &s;atisfied, and did &s;weetly re&s;ign him&s;elf up wholly to God's Di&s;po&s;al; And after a few Minutes, with a &s;udden Motion gathering up all his Strength, he gave him&s;elf a little Turn on one Side, and in the Twinkling of an Eye, departed to the Lord.</P>
<P>And now ble&s;&s;ed Soul, thy Longings are &s;atisfied, and thou &s;ee&s;t and feele&s;t a thou&s;and Times more than thou did&s;t upon Earth, and yet thou can&s;t bear it with Delight, thou art now welcomed to thy Father's Hou&s;e by Chri&s;t, the Beloved of thy Soul: Now thou
<PB N="40" REF="39">
ha&s;t heard him &s;ay, Come thou ble&s;&s;ed of my Father; and, Well done, good and faithful Servant, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord, and wear that Crown which was prepared for thee, before the Foundation of the World.</P>
<P>Oh that all the Relations which thou ha&s;t left be|hind thee, may live thy Life, and die thy Death, and live with Chri&s;t and thee, for ever and ever, <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He died</HI> June 1657, <HI>Aged</HI> 23-24, <HI>and was buried in</HI> Kel|&s;hall <HI>Church, in</HI> Hartford&s;hire.</P>
