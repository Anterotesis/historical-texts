<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Work being now completed, we conceive our engagement with the Sub&s;cribers, is, in every re&s;pect fulfilled, and that it only remains to embrace this opportunity, to repeat our thanks for their favours; and in particular, for the candour with which the Supplementary Part has been received.</P>
<P>But, in &s;ubmitting the work to the Public in general, as an illu&s;tration of an important branch of Briti&s;h Zoology, it is incumbent on us, to &s;tate briefly, the nature, and extent of the undertaking, the information it contains, and its peculiar advantages. In this retro&s;pective &s;urvey of the work, we mu&s;t advert to our former ob&s;ervations; &s;ome &s;imilar re|marks appeared at the conclu&s;ion of the fourth volume, and we retrace tho&s;e, as they immediately relate to the outline of our de&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">Ornithology, as a &s;cience, has undergone various altera|tions and improvements: different authors have &s;ubmitted their &s;y&s;tems to the world, and each has found its admirers and opponents; nor has the unrivalled genius of Linnaeus devi&s;ed an arrangement in which tho&s;e oppo&s;ite opinions may be reconciled. On the importance of Ornithology, in the great &s;cale of animated nature, no difference of opinion can prevail. The beauty and elegance of the feathered race: their plea&s;ing and various melody; their &s;agacity, and trac|table manners, has been admired in every age and country; and their unerring oeconomy and in&s;tinct, has ever engaged the attention of the moral philo&s;opher. The Birds of this country are of plainer colours than tho&s;e of warmer climates, but they are not le&s;s intere&s;ting to the Engli&s;h naturali&s;t. If, in &s;ome in&s;tances, their beauty has little claim to our no|tice; in others it excites our admiration; and to the intelli|gent mind, their beauty, their &s;ingularities, peculiar manners, and oeconomy are equally engaging. They are the &s;ource of information and improvement to the practical Ornithologi&s;t, and of rational and agreeable amu&s;ement to every common ob&s;erver of nature.</P>
<P>At the commencement of this work, it was our intention to form a complete Hi&s;tory of Briti&s;h Ornithology, and to include figures of all the known Birds, amounting to more than two hundred and fifty &s;pecies; but we have &s;ince con|ceived it would be advi&s;able to &s;elect only the more beau|tiful
<PB REF="5">
Birds, in addition to tho&s;e which are intere&s;ting to the naturali&s;t: for a con&s;iderable number of the Briti&s;h &s;pecies are &s;o well known, that their hi&s;tory would be tedious, and the figures unnece&s;&s;ary, in a work profe&s;&s;edly de&s;igned to treat of the mo&s;t remarkable &s;pecies only. Not that we have entirely overlooked the common Birds; in &s;everal in|&s;tances &s;ome of the&s;e are introduced al&s;o, to point out their &s;ingular habits of life, and other intere&s;ting peculiarities; but, in general, we have endeavoured to form an in&s;tructive as well as amu&s;ing illu&s;tration of this department of Natural Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>It will perhaps be contended, that a complete collection of figures and de&s;criptions of all the Briti&s;h Birds, would be more acceptable than any partial &s;election, however com|prehen&s;ive. We admit the propriety of this objection; but mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that &s;uch addition would con&s;iderably increa&s;e the expen&s;e to the purcha&s;er, and &s;carcely contri|bute to his information. On the other hand, this work, in its pre&s;ent limits, may a&s;&s;i&s;t the re&s;earches of the uninformed naturali&s;t, and tend to promote a deeper and more exten&s;ive enquiry into this branch of &s;cience. It embraces in one view the whole of tho&s;e Briti&s;h Birds that are &s;carcely known, and of which the inqui&s;itive reader, under many circum|&s;tances, may be de&s;irous of information. We have omitted many of tho&s;e Birds which con&s;tantly inhabit this country; but have included all local &s;pecies, and in particular, tho&s;e,
<PB REF="6">
who&s;e haunts and breeding places are difficult of acce&s;s, and the Birds in con&s;equence, little known. The exten&s;ive mar&s;hes and lowlands in &s;ome parts of the kingdom, are the retreats and breeding places of certain &s;pecies. Tho&s;e &s;olitary kinds, which retire to the depths, and gloomy re|ce&s;&s;es of fore&s;ts, are rarely ob&s;erved; and many of tho&s;e which &s;eek the open plain for &s;ecurity, elude our vigilance, and are not better known. But the rare&s;t of the local kinds, are of the rapacious and gallinaceous tribes, which never leave their dreary &s;olitudes: their wilds and barren moun|tains in the north; to vi&s;it the &s;outhern parts of Great Bri|tain. The migratory Birds are numerous, and include many well known &s;pecies, with others that are uncommonly &s;carce. We have taken an exten&s;ive variety of the beautiful Land Birds, that re&s;ort to this country occa&s;ionally from the &s;outh of Europe; and of the aquatic or web-footed tribe, that are driven by the &s;everity of the winter in the Arctic regions to &s;eek &s;helter on our &s;hores. Hi&s;tory and tradition inform us of other Birds that formerly inhabited the&s;e king|doms, but are now extirpated; and the&s;e form an intere&s;ting &s;equel to this &s;election. We cannot vindicate the pro|priety of introducing naturalized exotic &s;pecies among&s;t the&s;e, though they are arranged by our Naturali&s;ts in the Briti&s;h Ornithology; and in &s;ome in&s;tances we have fol|lowed their authority, for the &s;ake of embelli&s;hment and variety.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">In the cour&s;e of publication, we have been fortunate in procuring &s;pecimens of many uncommon Birds. Among the mo&s;t remarkable, are <HI>The Ro&s;e-coloured Ouzel, Roller, Little Bittern, Waxen Chatterer, Black Woodpecker,</HI> and in particular that rare and almo&s;t unknown &s;pecies, the <HI>Wood Chat.&mdash;The Red-necked Grebe, Dartford Warbler, Du&s;ky Lark, Long-legged Plover, Egret</HI> and <HI>Cock of the Wood.</HI> We could enumerate many other &s;pecies highly important to the uninformed naturali&s;t; but, we refer our readers for the general detail, to the complete Sy&s;tematic Arrangement an|nexed to this Adverti&s;ement.</P>
<P>In this Sy&s;tematic Arrangement we have followed the <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae</HI> of Linnaeus, though we totally di&s;&s;ent from the opinion of that celebrated naturali&s;t in his primary divi&s;ions of Ornithology. In every &s;y&s;tem, the Birds which inhabit the land only, are &s;eparated from &s;uch as frequent the water. This appears to be a natural method of forming two principal divi&s;ions of Ornithology; it was adopted by Ray, and approved by Pennant and Latham. In the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem, tho&s;e which inhabit the water are &s;eparated from the re&s;t; but the Land Birds are divided into two parts, and the Water Birds are placed between them. To avoid con|fu&s;ion we have adhered to this arrangement; but we have al&s;o placed an Index, in the manner of Pennant and Latham, at the conclu&s;ion of each volume.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">Having endeavoured to explain the nature and extent of this undertaking, we &s;ubmit the whole to the candour of the Public; and, though not indifferent to the flattering te&s;timony of approbation, it has received in the cour&s;e of five years publication, we entreat indulgence for whatever may be thought exceptionable, either in the outline of our under|taking, the &s;election of &s;pecies, or the manner in which they are illu&s;trated. To our Sub&s;cribers, we &s;hall not pre&s;ume to addre&s;s any apology, as their opinion mu&s;t be already decided. The progre&s;&s;ive manner in which the work has appeared, has afforded every opportunity for cri|tical examination, for detecting error, or di&s;covering merit; and, we tru&s;t, their continued patronage is &s;ome criterion of their approbation, and of the general utility of our de&s;ign.</P>

<P>The Great Titmou&s;e, Colemou&s;e, and Mar&s;h Titmou&s;e; with the Blue, Long-tailed, and Bearded, Titmice, are the only &s;pecies of the tribe which inhabit this country: they are all very frequent ex|cepting the latter; which however is not uncommon in certain &s;itua|tions, though formerly e&s;teemed as rare.</P>
<P>It was de&s;cribed by <HI>Aldrovandus</HI> in his Ornithology publi&s;hed in the years 1610&mdash;1613; and appears to be well known at that time in &s;e|veral parts of Europe, though unknown in Britain: more than a cen|tury after <HI>Aldrovandus,</HI> (1734), it was included in a Hi&s;tory of the Birds of Germany by <HI>J. L. Fri&s;ch;</HI> but even at that time, was &s;o rare with us, that it was &s;carcely a&s;certained to be a native of Britain; and Albin, who &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome knowledge of Birds, de|termines it as a native, only on the authority of the information he received from others; his Hi&s;tory of Birds was publi&s;hed in 1738; therein he gives a figure of the Male Bird, and &s;ays in the De&s;criptions annexed, "The&s;e two birds (male and female) I bought of Mr. <HI>Bland</HI> on <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> who told me he had them from <HI>Jutland:</HI> I have been &s;ince informed by Sir <HI>Robert Abdy,</HI> that they are found in the <HI>Salt|mar&s;hes</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and by others that they are likewi&s;e in the fens in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire."</HI></P>
<P>He al&s;o ob&s;erves that it receives the name Beardmanica from the black tuft re&s;embling a picked beard.</P>
<P>Edwards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">G. Edwards's Nat. Hi&s;t. of Birds, Vol. 7. 4 to. London, 1743, &amp;c.</NOTE> refers it to the tribe of Butcher-birds, under the title of LANIUS <HI>Minimus,</HI> Lea&s;t Butcher-Bird; but Linnaeus, in his <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae,</HI> reduced it to the PARUS genus; and late writers have al&s;o determined it to the &s;ame family.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="23">Its length, from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail, is &s;ix inches and a quarter: the bill is thick, and of a bright yellow colour, but fades immediately when the bird dies; in the female it is rather du&s;ky; and the head, which is of a fine grey in the male, is of a browni&s;h ru&s;t colour, &s;potted with black, in the female: indeed, the female is immediately di&s;tingui&s;hed by the plainne&s;s of her plumage, it neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the beautiful purple colour on the brea&s;t, or the black tufts on the throat, which characterizes the male: the vent-feathers of the male are pale black; of the female light brown; as are the other parts of the belly.</P>
<P>Pennant, in the Briti&s;h Zoology, &s;ays, "This &s;pecies is found in the mar&s;hes near <HI>London:</HI> we have &s;een it near <HI>Glouce&s;ter:</HI> it is al&s;o frequent among the great tracts of reeds near <HI>Cowbit</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> where I &s;u&s;pect they breed.</P>
<P>Latham, in his General Synop&s;is,&mdash;"The&s;e birds are found in England, but have hitherto been ob&s;erved only in mar&s;hy &s;ituations where <HI>reeds</HI> grow, on the &s;eeds of which it feeds, as well as &s;mall in|&s;ects; both of which have been found in their &s;tomachs.

The ne&s;t is not known for certain; but I have &s;een one, which was compo&s;ed of very &s;oft downy materials, &s;u&s;pended between three reeds drawn together, thought to be the work of that bird."</P>
<P>"They are al&s;o common in <HI>Denmark;</HI> and <HI>Buffon</HI> &s;uppo&s;es that a pair of the&s;e, having e&s;caped from the cage of the <HI>Counte&s;s</HI> of <HI>Albe|marle,</HI>

<P>The Jay, though very frequent in every part of the country, evi|dently de&s;erves, for the &s;ingular beauty of its plumage, the fir&s;t place in a collection of intere&s;ting Briti&s;h Birds: it is a &s;pecies, however, not merely confined to this kingdom; but generally diffu&s;ed over the greater part of the continent of Europe.</P>
<P>Among the foreign birds which are referred to this genus, are &s;e|veral &s;pecies eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed for their rich and elegant colour|ing; but the European Jay is certainly &s;uperior in this particular to many exotics of the &s;ame family.</P>
<P>Its habits are known, in a great degree, to re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Magpie, which al&s;o belongs to the &s;ame genus. It will devour with avidity cherries, goo&s;eberries, ra&s;pberries, or other fruits; but in au|tumn and winter it feeds on acorns; whence it long &s;ince derived the name PICA <HI>Glandaria.</HI> It is not de&s;titute of a carnivorous ap|petite, as it frequently combats, and devours, &s;mall birds: it al&s;o feeds on worms and in&s;ects.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="29">Ablin, in Plate 16. Vol. 1. very accurately de&s;cribes the Jay he took his figure from, which nearly corre&s;ponds with our &s;pecimen.</P>
<P>"Its length, from the point of the bill to the end of the tail, was fourteen inches; its breadth, when the wings were extended, twenty-one inches and an half; its weight &s;even ounces; the bill dark a&s;h co|lour inclining to black, &s;trong, near an inch and an half long; the tongue black, thin, pellucid, and cloven at the tip; the irides of the eyes white. Near on the lower chap of the bill are two black &s;pots, on each &s;ide one. The chin and lower part of the belly whiti&s;h, el&s;e the brea&s;t and belly are of a mixt cinereous and red; the rump above is white, the back red, with a mixture of blue; the feathers on the crown of the head variegated with black and white.</P>
<P>"The &s;ails of the wings are in number twenty, of which the fir&s;t is &s;horter by half than the &s;econd, the fourth the longe&s;t (being by mea|&s;ure &s;ix inches and a quarter); the fir&s;t or outermo&s;t is black, the bottom or lower part white, which is proper to it alone; the &s;ix next following have their exterior vanes of an a&s;h colour, the three next likewi&s;e, but more ob&s;cure, and mingled with blue, being al&s;o marked toward their bottom with tran&s;ver&s;e black and white &s;trokes; the five &s;ucceeding have their exterior vanes half white, half black, viz. the lower half white, the upper black, but &s;o that each extremity of the white is terminated with blue; the &s;ixteenth, in place of the white of the four precedent, hath tran&s;ver&s;e blue, black, and white &s;pots; the &s;eventeenth is black, having one or two blue &s;pots; the eighteenth is black with &s;ome little red; the nineteenth red with the tip black; the under &s;ides of all the feathers of the wing are of a dark or du&s;ky colour; the covert-feathers of the fifteen exterior &s;ails are very beautiful, being variegated or chequered with black, white, and lovely &s;hining blue lines, the re&s;t of the covert-feathers being black.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="30">"The tail is &s;ix inches and a quarter long, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve feathers, wholly black except toward their roots: under the rump there is &s;omething of a blue mingled with cinereous.</P>
<P>"The feet and toes are of a ferruginous du&s;ky colour, the middle toe is the longe&s;t; the outmo&s;t is equal to the back toe; the lower joint of the outmo&s;t toe is joined to the middlemo&s;t; the back claw is the greate&s;t.</P>
<P>"The guts are twenty-four inches long; the blind guts but half an inch; it hath a gall and a long &s;pleen: the &s;tomach or gizzard not very fle&s;hy, and having its echinus, wherein were found acorns, &amp;c."</P>
<P>He adds, "The female differs little or nothing from the male, either in bigne&s;s or colour, &s;o that it is very difficult to know them a&s;under:" but after the publication of his fir&s;t Volume of Birds, he rectifies this error, in a &s;upplement which is prefixed to the work. "The following ob&s;ervations," (&s;ays he) "I received from Dr. Der|ham, after the de&s;criptions were printed. He hath ob&s;erved the Cock Jay (Plate 16. Vol. 1.) to be &s;omewhat bigger than the Hen, the feathers on the head to be blacker, the &s;tripes longer, and the black and blue colours more elegant in the Cock than in the Hen."</P>
<P>Jays generally build in woods, preferring a &s;ituation near the &s;kirts: the ne&s;t is compo&s;ed of fibrous roots, and young twigs, erected on a ba&s;e of &s;everal large &s;ticks, and is placed on the top of a thorn-bu&s;h, or other under-wood, or between the fir&s;t branches of low decayed trees: the female lays five or &s;ix eggs, of the &s;ize of a pigeon's, of a cinereous olive colour, marked with very pale brown &s;pots: the young Jays remain with their parents till the next &s;pring; and at the pairing time they each choo&s;e his mate, to propagate their future progeny.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="31">It is a re&s;tle&s;s and very quarrel&s;ome bird: makes a har&s;h, chattering and &s;creaming noi&s;e; and is ever at variance not only with its own &s;pecies, but with every other inhabitant of the fore&s;t: when deprived of liberty, it may be taught to imitate the human voice; but the ori|ginal appearance of its plumage is &s;o altered by confinement, as &s;carcely to retain any of the beautiful colours, which are &s;o emi|nently con&s;picuous in the wild &s;tate.</P>
<P>It is a native of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of <HI>England;</HI> but does not frequent the i&s;lands adjacent.</P>
<P>Latham &s;ays, "The Jay, I believe, is not &s;pread &s;o far as many others of the genus, as we do not hear of its inhabiting further &s;outh than <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Greece.</HI></P>

<P>This &s;pecies is very rare in every part of Europe; and e&s;pecially in this country: we have a figure of it in the Briti&s;h Zoology; but unfor|tunately, notwith&s;tanding Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI>'s very laudable intentions, he had no opportunity of con&s;ulting the original &s;pecimen; he depended on a drawing done by his friend Mr. <HI>G. Edwards;</HI> and the copy is only a di&s;tant imitation of the bird; it is defective about the body, and ex|ceedingly incorrect as to the circumference of the neck; the account &s;ays, "Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> di&s;covered this beautiful bird twice in our i&s;land, near <HI>London,</HI> at <HI>Norwood,</HI> and another time in <HI>Norfolk;"</HI> the figure of this was copied by permi&s;&s;ion from his beautiful and accurate de&s;ign, which we gratefully acknowledge, as well as every other a&s;&s;i&s;tance from our worthy friend; who&s;e pencil has done &s;o much honour to his country.</P>

<P><PB REF="40">The appellations Regulus, and Tyrannus, Little King, or Tyrant, have been given to the golden-cre&s;ted Wren by &s;ome authors: it has ability to conceal the orange band on the head; by corrugating the forehead, and drawing together the feathers, which form the black longitudinal band on each &s;ide.</P>
<P>The colour of the plumage of the female is paler, than of the male; the cre&s;t or feathers on the crown of the head are yellow, but without the bright orange colour, which &s;oftens into the cre&s;t of the male.</P>
<P>It remains with us through the winter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Latham.</HI> IV. 509. 145.</NOTE>; frequents woods; and builds its ne&s;t, either in oak, fir, or yew trees, the ne&s;t is of a roundi&s;h form, with an opening on one &s;ide; it is compo&s;ed of <HI>mo&s;s;</HI> and lined within with &s;ome downy &s;ub&s;tance, (perhaps cobwebs,) intermixed with &s;mall filaments.</P>

This bird is very frequent in England, and is &s;pread throughout the whole of the old Continent; <HI>Latham</HI> &s;ays he has more than once met with a repre&s;entation of it in <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> drawings: it extends as far as <HI>Iceland,</HI> the <HI>Feroe I&s;les,</HI> and <HI>Drontheim;</HI> it is common in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia, Siberia,</HI> and <HI>Kampt&s;chatka;</HI> but is not found in the more northern regions.</P>
<P>It al&s;o inhabits <HI>India,</HI> a drawing which was done on the &s;pot being in the collection of Lady Impey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Latham Supp.</HI> Gen. Syn. 178.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It frequents the &s;ides of pools and &s;mall rivulets; and feeds on in&s;ects: it is often &s;een running on the ground with much celerity, or leaping up after flies: the tail is frequently in motion. Birds of this genus &s;eldom perch; fly in an undulating manner, and have a twitter|ing noi&s;e in flight.</P>
<P><HI>Willughby</HI> ob&s;erves, that this &s;pecies &s;hifts its quarters in the win|ter; moving from the north to the &s;outh of England during that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Latham</HI> &s;u&s;pects that part of them migrate, as he does not recollect &s;eeing &s;o many in winter, as in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, and &s;ays, in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and in the north of England, it is &s;carce ever &s;een in hard weather.</P>
<P>This, and others of this cla&s;s, are called, both by the French and Engli&s;h, <HI>Wa&s;her-Women,</HI> or <HI>Di&s;h-Wa&s;hers.</HI></P>
<P>It is particularly &s;erviceable to the farmer in Spring and Autumn, by attending the plough to devour the larvae of in&s;ects, worms, &amp;c. which are turned up; hence it is the intere&s;t of the farmer to di&s;|courage any attempt to de&s;troy tho&s;e birds, and to this circum&s;tance they may owe much for their pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB REF="45">The marks and colours vary very con&s;iderably in different &s;pecimens. Some have only a cre&s;cent of black on the brea&s;t, the chin and throat being quite white, in others all the white parts are &s;trongly tinctured with yellow; in &s;ome the chin, fore part of the neck, and brea&s;t, are black; and in the <HI>Leverian Mu&s;eum</HI> is a fine variety; white, except the hind parts, which are yellowi&s;h.</P>
<P>In the <HI>females,</HI> the top of the head generally inclines to brown. The u&s;ual length of this &s;pecies is &s;even inches from the bill to the extre|mity of the tail.</P>
<P>The ne&s;t is built on the ground, is compo&s;ed of dry gra&s;s, fine fibres, and mo&s;s; lined with hair, feathers, or &s;oft dry gra&s;s; the eggs are five in number; white, &s;potted with brown: for the mo&s;t part they have only one brood in a year.</P>

<P>Suppo&s;ed to inhabit &s;ome parts of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway;</HI> has been di&s;covered, though very rarely, near the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea;</HI> and was once received by <HI>Mr. Pennant,</HI> from <HI>Copenhagen.</HI></P>
<P>It is probably a &s;carce bird in every part; in this country it has been only di&s;covered by a few individuals, and that very lately; we believe the mo&s;t perfect yet taken, to be that &s;pecimen of which Mr. Latham has given a figure in the &s;upplement to his General Synop&s;is; our figure is al&s;o copied from the &s;ame bird.</P>
<P>It is on the authority of this author, that we include it as a Briti&s;h bird; in his de&s;cription he &s;ays, "I received a perfect &s;pecimen of the <HI>Male</HI> of this bird from Major <HI>Hammond,</HI> who informed me, that the end of April, the year 1786, two of them alighted in a farm-yard, near his hou&s;e, in <HI>Ea&s;t Kent,</HI> and were taken alive."</P>
<P>"I have al&s;o met with two other &s;pecimens; the fir&s;t &s;ent to me <HI>January</HI> 28, 1786, by <HI>Mr. Martin,</HI> of <HI>Teignmouth,</HI> a gentleman to whom I owe many other obligations: his &s;pecimen had not come to perfection, as the colours on the head and neck were much blended, and the ferruginous on the neck only ju&s;t breaking forth. <HI>Mr. Boys,</HI> of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> al&s;o obliged me with a third, the beginning of la&s;t <HI>October,</HI> (1787): his bird, he informed me, weighed nineteen ounces and a half; the length twenty-one inches and a half; breadth eight. The bill yellow at the ba&s;e, du&s;ky olive towards the tip: lore du&s;ky: irides pale brown: head quite &s;mooth. The de&s;cription differed not much; but the ferruginous colour of the neck was much blended with du&s;ky; the white on the under parts greatly mottled with the &s;ame: Legs du&s;ky; within, greeni&s;h yellow. The middle toe united to the
<PB REF="49">
inner as far as the fir&s;t joint; and to the outer, to the middle of the &s;econd <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This &s;pecies was unknown to Linnaeus, but according to his definition,evidently belongs to the genus COLYMBUS: <HI>Latham</HI> ob&s;erves, that Linnaeus has erroneou&s;ly included the <HI>Grebes, Divers,</HI> and <HI>Guillemots</HI> into that genus without even a divi&s;ion, though they very materially differ from one another; e&s;pecially in the legs: tho&s;e of the <HI>Grebes</HI> are not webbed; the <HI>Guillemots,</HI> though web-footed, have only three toes, all placed forwards; and the <HI>Divers</HI> have three toes before, and one behind.</P>
<P>He therefore thinks that they &s;hould be &s;eparated; and as the form of the feet of this &s;pecies appears to prevail throughout the genus, recommends its being included with the other parts of its e&s;&s;ential character; he has named his new genus PODICEPS.</P>
<P>Pennant has al&s;o &s;ubmitted to a divi&s;ion of the Linnaean <HI>genus.</HI> "The <HI>Grebes</HI> and <HI>Divers</HI> are placed in the &s;ame genus, <HI>i. e.</HI> of <HI>Colymbi,</HI> by <HI>Mr. Ray</HI> and <HI>Linnaeus;</HI> but the difference of the feet forbade our judicious friend, <HI>M.

Zool.</HI> 2.496.</P></NOTE>."</P>
<P>"The two la&s;t mentioned are, no doubt, birds not in full plumage. That de&s;cribed by <HI>Dr. Sparrman</HI> is clearly under the &s;ame predica|ment; perhaps a &s;till younger bird than either of the others, as the cinereous parts on the throat appear white, with three or four lines of black, and acro&s;s the lower part of the neck is a band of white. The bird figured in <HI>Jacquin</HI> &s;eems an adult."</P>
<P>That mentioned by <HI>Buffon</HI> was &s;eventeen inches in length; had the brea&s;t mottled with ferruginous; and a white &s;pot on the quills.</P>

<P>Length from the point of the bill to the end of the feet twelve inches; breadth twenty-one. Weight twelve ounces. The bill is an inch and a quarter long, and of a very &s;ingular &s;hape, much compre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ides, and near an inch and an half deep at the ba&s;e; from whence both mandibles tend to a point, which is a little curved; acro&s;s the upper are four oblique furrows; on the under three: half next the point is red; that next the ba&s;e blue grey; and at the ba&s;e is a <HI>cere</HI> full of minute holes: the no&s;trils are a long and narrow &s;lit on each &s;ide, near the edge of the upper mandible, and parallel to it: the top of the head, the neck, and upper parts of the body black; beneath white: legs orange.</P>
<P>The bill, which gives &s;uch an appearance of novelty to this bird, varies con&s;iderably according to its age; in the fir&s;t year it is &s;mall, weak, de&s;titute of any furrow, and du&s;ky; in the &s;econd year it is larger, &s;tronger, of a paler colour, and di&s;covers a faint ve&s;tige of a furrow near the ba&s;e; but tho&s;e of the third or more advanced years, have a bill of great &s;trength and vivid colours as before de&s;cribed.

<P>To what part tho&s;e birds emigrate on the approach of winter is very imperfectly known; it is probable when they retire from tho&s;e northern regions, their flight is directed to &s;ome more temperate climate; per|haps they live at &s;ea, and form tho&s;e multitudes of birds that navigators

<P>On the coa&s;t of <HI>Kamt&s;chatka</HI> and the <HI>Kuril&s;chi</HI> i&s;lands they are very common, even on the <HI>Pen&s;chin&s;ki Bay,</HI> almo&s;t as far as <HI>Ochotka:</HI> the nations of the two fir&s;t wear the bills about their necks fa&s;tened to &s;traps; the&s;e are put on by their <HI>Shaman</HI> or <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> for the people are per&s;uaded that by putting them on with a proper ceremony, they will procure good fortune to all their undertakings <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

"The hen of this bird was &s;hot in the garden of Mr. <HI>Starkey Mayos,</HI> at <HI>Woodford</HI> on <HI>Epping Fore&s;t,</HI> where they had ob&s;erved it &s;ome time, and u&s;ed all the means to take it they could; but it was &s;o &s;hy, that it avoided all their traps which were laid for it; which the gentleman ob&s;erving, ordered it to be &s;hot: it was &s;ent to me to be pre&s;erved for him.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>The cock of this kind I drew from a picture done in <HI>Germany,</HI> by a great ma&s;ter there, now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Ni&s;bet,</HI> a gentle|man, who had it drawn from the bird when alive.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome difference in the colours of the hen, and this bird which was a cock, I was credibly informed by <HI>Robert Bri&s;tow,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>
who &s;aw both the drawings of the cock and hen, and told me his &s;on &s;hot the cock, which was like the drawing at his &s;eat at <HI>Micheler,</HI> near <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire.</HI></P> <BIBL><HI>Albin,</HI> Vol. II. 42, 43.</BIBL></Q>
<P><HI>Latham</HI> ob&s;erves, "it is a &s;olitary bird, and &s;eldom more than two are &s;een together; though it is &s;aid that in <HI>Egypt</HI> it a&s;&s;embles in &s;mall troops. It is very common in <HI>Cairo,</HI> where it builds in the &s;treets, on the terraces of hou&s;es, &amp;c. It is al&s;o common in the de&s;erts of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Tartary,</HI> though &s;carce beyond the river <HI>Ob;</HI> however &s;ome are found beyond the <HI>Lake Baikal.</HI> Dr. <HI>Pallas</HI> confirms the account of the filthy manners of this bird, as he met with an in&s;tance of a pair breeding in the privy of an uninhabited hou&s;e in the &s;uburbs of <HI>Tzaritzn</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Arct. Zool.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"I am informed by colonel <HI>Davies,</HI> that they every year are &s;een in <HI>Gibraltar</HI> in <HI>March,</HI> in &s;mall flocks of ten or twelve; hence are
<PB REF="67">
called there <HI>March Cocks.</HI> They are &s;uppo&s;ed to come from <HI>Africa,</HI> and to be on their pa&s;&s;age north to &s;ome other place, as they only &s;tay a few hours to re&s;t them&s;elves: and it is not uncommon to &s;ee five or &s;ix flocks in a week, during the time of their pa&s;&s;age. He did not ob|&s;erve them to have any note; but that they had a dipping kind of flight not unlike a <HI>Woodpecker.</HI> I have ob&s;erved this Bird to be among paintings both from <HI>China</HI> and <HI>India;</HI> it is therefore no doubt com|mon to both tho&s;e parts." <HI>Lath. Gen. Syn.</HI></P>
<P>In Sweden the appearance of this Bird is regarded as a pre&s;age of war; and in England its vi&s;its were formerly con&s;idered as ominous by the vulgar.</P>
<P>In Turkey it is called <HI>Tir Chaous,</HI> or the Me&s;&s;enger Bird from the re&s;emblance its cre&s;t has to the plumes worn by the <HI>Chaous,</HI> or <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> couriers.</P>
<P>Latham &s;ays, the <HI>female</HI> is like the <HI>male,</HI> and lays from two to &s;even eggs; but for the mo&s;t part four or five. The&s;e are &s;omewhat le&s;s than tho&s;e of a Partridge, but longer and a&s;h-coloured. This Bird is &s;aid to have two or three broods in a year, and to lay the eggs in the holes of trees, like the <HI>Woodpecker,</HI> but in general to make no ne&s;t: notwith&s;tanding which, <HI>Buffon</HI> ob&s;erved, that two out of &s;ix ne&s;ts, which were brought to him for in&s;pection, had a &s;oft lining of mo&s;s, wool, leaves, feathers, and the like; and he is of opinion, that when this is the ca&s;e, the bird has made u&s;e of the old ne&s;t of &s;ome other bird. It will al&s;o lay, and hatch the young in holes of walls, and even on the ground. The food of this bird is in&s;ects; and it is the exuviae of the large beetles, and &s;uch like, with which the ne&s;t is crouded, that cau&s;e the ne&s;t to &s;tink &s;o horribly; in&s;omuch that former writers a&s;&s;erted the ne&s;t to be made of excrement.</P>
<P><PB REF="68">In <HI>Sepp</HI>'s plate the ne&s;t is placed in the hollow of a tree; it is compo&s;ed of &s;oft bents, and &s;mooth within. The eggs, four in number, of a bluei&s;h white, marked with pale brown &s;pots.</P>
<P><HI>Buffon</HI> mentions one of this &s;pecies which lived with a lady for three months, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting only on bread and chee&s;e; and, contrary to the common opinion, drank frequently, and that by gulps. Another was kept for eighteen months on raw meat, and would not eat any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Olina</HI> &s;ays, that this bird lives three years.</P>
<P>In &s;ome countries it is e&s;teemed as good eating. It &s;eldom perches on trees, unle&s;s they are very low. It does not erect its cre&s;t, except when agitated by &s;urprize: in a natural &s;tate the cre&s;t falling behind the neck <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>; but whenever it alights on the ground, it is &s;aid to &s;pread its cre&s;t beautifully.</P>
<P>Some authors mention a variety of this &s;pecies. <HI>Kolben</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en.

Another &s;pecimen from the &s;ame place, had the upper part of the beak of a deep brown, and the belly varied with brown and white; but as this was le&s;s in every re&s;pect, it was probably a young bird.</P>

<P><PB REF="71">This bird mea&s;ures five inches from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail: it is of a lively appearance, though not very beautiful in the colours of its plumage; and de&s;erves our immediate attention as one of the lea&s;t known &s;pecies we have in this country.</P>
<P>It is a native of <HI>France</HI> as well as of <HI>England.</HI> In <HI>Provence</HI> it is commonly found among cabbages: it feeds on the in&s;ects that harbour among tho&s;e vegetables, and not unfrequently conceals it&s;elf under the &s;helter of the leaves during the night.</P>
<P>A friend of Mr. Latham's &s;hot a pair of tho&s;e birds on <HI>Bexley Heath,</HI> near <HI>Dartford</HI> in <HI>Kent, April</HI> the 10th, 1773, as they were &s;itting on a furze bu&s;h: they fed on flies; &s;pringing from the bu&s;h every time one approached near, and returning to the &s;ame place repeatedly; thereby imitating, as he ob&s;erves, the manners of our <HI>Cinereous Flycatcher.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;pecies re&s;ides with us in the winter. Several &s;pecimens, which are now pre&s;erved in the Leverian Mu&s;eum, were &s;hot on a common near <HI>Wand&s;worth</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> 1782.</P>
<P>Mr. Latham appears to entertain &s;ome doubt, whether this &s;pecies ever breeds in France <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des Ois. v. p. 158.</NOTE>. He &s;ays an intelligent ob&s;erver of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Birds <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Green.</NOTE> has informed him, that he never met with this &s;pecies in the neighbourhood of <HI>London,</HI> except in <HI>winter;</HI> and that it di&s;appears be|fore the end of <HI>April.</HI> Should this be the general fact, he can by no means reconcile the circum&s;tance of its breeding in <HI>France,</HI> as all mi|gratory birds retire northward to breed, not to a warmer climate; and &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e, that if it does not quit <HI>England</HI> in &s;ummer, it will hereafter be found in the northern parts of it.</P>

<P>The Yellow Wren ranks among the lea&s;t of the Briti&s;h Birds; it mea&s;ures only four inches and three quarters from the tip of the bill to the extremity of the tail. The colours of its plumage are not at|tractive, neither do we introduce it as a rare bird, being one of our mo&s;t frequent &s;pecies; but it is a very delicately formed creature, ex|ceedingly active, and by concealing it&s;elf immediately among the thicke&s;t of the foliage when any noi&s;e approaches, it may not be &s;o generally known as &s;ome le&s;s timid birds.</P>
<P>It chiefly frequents large woods, which abound with willows; and builds its ne&s;t at the roots of trees, or in the hollows of dry banks; it is con&s;tructed in the form of an egg, with a hole at the top for its entrance, the out&s;ide is compo&s;ed of mo&s;s and hay, or &s;traw; and the in&s;ide is lined with &s;oft feathers, wool, or hair. It lays &s;even white eggs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pennant Br. Zool. <HI>1. 151.</HI></NOTE>, or, according to <HI>Latham</HI> and <HI>Albin,</HI> only five; they are freckled all over with reddi&s;h &s;pots.

It is &s;aid that the male has a &s;ong during incubation, far from unplea|&s;ing, and is &s;oft, though weak. It is migratory, but vi&s;its us early.</P>
<P><PB REF="89"><HI>Albin</HI> &s;ays it &s;ings like a gra&s;hopper, and frequents woods and &s;oli|tary places, &s;itting on the tops of oaks.</P>
<P><HI>Pennant</HI> ob&s;erves, that the brea&s;t, belly, and thighs, vary in colour in different birds; in &s;ome tho&s;e parts are of a bright yellow, in others they fade almo&s;t into white. The legs al&s;o appear to admit of varia|tion, tho&s;e of our &s;pecimens are yellowi&s;h in both &s;exes, <HI>Albin</HI> de|&s;cribes tho&s;e of his male &s;pecimen to be pale amber colour, and tho&s;e of the hen to be black.</P>
<P><HI>Latham,</HI> in his <HI>Gen. Syn.</HI> has given a de&s;cription of four other birds, which he con&s;iders only as varieties of the MOTACILLA TROCHILUS. Among tho&s;e are included the GREATER NON-CRESTED REGULUS of <HI>Willughby,</HI> and the MOTACILLA ACREDULA of <HI>Lin|naeus.</HI> This latter bird appears in the <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology</HI> of <HI>Pennant</HI> as a new &s;pecies, (the Scotch Wren;) it has been al&s;o con&s;idered as a di&s;tinct kind in the writings of &s;ome, and the &s;ynonymas of others, as <HI>Bri&s;&s;on, Buffon, Ray, Sloane, Cate&s;by,</HI> and <HI>Edwards,</HI> but as it dif|fered from our &s;pecies only in the colour of the upper parts, inclining more to brown than to green, and the lower parts more to yellow, Mr. <HI>Latham</HI> concluded it was only a variety. It is a native of <HI>Ja|maica, Carolina,</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> but one was communicated to Mr. <HI>Latham</HI> by <HI>E. S.

<P>The length of the male is twelve inches, of the female ten inches; the bill of the former is yellow in &s;ome, in others black, or dark brown; the face is covered with yellow pear-&s;haped pimples; the back part of the head and neck are furni&s;hed with long feathers, which expand in a very &s;ingular manner on each &s;ide of the neck, and impend loo&s;ely over the brea&s;t, like the ruff anciently worn in this country. A portion or tuft of tho&s;e feathers project al&s;o ju&s;t beyond each eye, and have the appearance of long ears.</P>
<P>As the mo&s;t remarkable peculiarity of tho&s;e birds are that no two &s;pecimens are ever found to agree in the colours of the plumage, it is impo&s;&s;ible to give any de&s;cription, except of its form, that may a&s;&s;i&s;t the un&s;kilful ornithologi&s;t to determine the &s;pecies, when it

has attained the ruff; it cannot, however, be mi&s;taken, as no Bird of this country re&s;embles it in the &s;malle&s;t degree. The ground colour is generally brown, but it varies in different Birds to every hue between the lighte&s;t teint that can de&s;erve that name, and the deepe&s;t chocolate colour; &s;ometimes we find the ruff of a fine tender buff colour, without the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of &s;pots, except on the brea&s;t and back, which may be of a deep black, intermingled with a few white feathers, and glo&s;&s;ed with &s;hining purple; others we find that have the ruffs of a deep brown, barred with black; &s;ome with white ruffs &s;potted with brown, or brown &s;potted with white; and indeed with every variation that it is po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The <HI>females,</HI> or <HI>Reeves,</HI> Pennant a&s;&s;erts, never change their colours, which he &s;ays are pale brown; the back &s;potted with black, &s;lightly edged with white; the tail brown; the middle feathers &s;potted with black; the brea&s;t and belly white; the legs of a pale dull yellow: but I have two &s;pecimens that do not well agree with his de&s;cription, or corre&s;pond with each other; and in the Leverian mu&s;eum a variety of that &s;ex is pre&s;erved that is wholly white, except the wings, on which the u&s;ual markings are vi&s;ible in a very pale colour.</P>
<P>The female has no ruff, and the male does not attain that appendage until the &s;econd &s;ea&s;on; at the time of incubation the plumage of the latter is in the full perfection, and the pimples break out on his face: but after that time they &s;hrink beneath the &s;kin, the long feathers of the ruff fall off, and he again a&s;&s;umes the plain appearance of the female.</P>
<P>The&s;e Birds inhabit the North of <HI>Europe</HI> in &s;ummer, as far as Ice|land, as well as the northern mar&s;hes of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Siberia.</HI> In this country they are found in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> the I&s;le of <HI>Ely,</HI> and in the ea&s;t

<P>The Reeve lays four eggs in a tuft of gra&s;s the beginning of May; they are white, marked with large ru&s;ty &s;pots.</P>
<P>Soon after their arrival, the males begin to <HI>hill;</HI> that is, to collect on &s;ome dry bank near a &s;pla&s;h of water, in expectation of the females. Each male keeps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;mall piece of ground, round which it runs &s;o often as to form a bare circular path; the in&s;tant a female alights among them, the males are in motion; a general battle en&s;ues, and the fowlers, who have been waiting for the advantage of &s;uch an event, catch them in their nets in great numbers <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They vi&s;it a place called <HI>Martin-mere</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> the latter end of March, or beginning of April, but do not continue there above three weeks.&mdash;<HI>Brit.

<P>In the fens each male remains within his circle, and defends him&s;elf again&s;t every invader with much re&s;olution; the lea&s;t infringement on his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by another male is re&s;ented with the greate&s;t violence; and if any farther attack is made, a battle is the con&s;equence: in fighting they have the &s;ame action as a cock, &s;pread their ruffs, and place their bills to the ground.</P>

<P>The Coldfinch, or according to Latham and Pennant, the Pied Fly-catcher, is found in <HI>York&s;hire, Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Derby&s;hire;</HI> in tho&s;e parts of the kingdom it is not very frequent, in every other it is ex|tremely rare.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary for us to de&s;cribe the many varieties that are known of this &s;pecies; in England the colours of its plumage varies con&s;i|derably at different &s;ea&s;ons of the year; but &s;uch as are natives of fo|reign countries, are again &s;o di&s;&s;imilar to ours, that different authors have alternately de&s;cribed them as varieties, or new &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The bird that <HI>Latham</HI> de&s;cribes, was white on the outer web of the exterior tail feather; the two exterior tail feathers of <HI>Willoughby</HI>'s bird was marked with white; and on the contrary, we have a &s;peci|men which does not exhibit the lea&s;t trace of white on either. The upper tail coverts are black and white mixed, in &s;ome &s;pecimens; in others they are wholly black; and <HI>Le Gobe-mouche noir</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;&s;on,</HI> which is only another variety, differs in having a mixture of grey on
<PB REF="122">
the upper parts, the thighs brown and white, and <HI>three</HI> of the exte|rior tail feathers white on the margins.</P>
<P>A more plea&s;ing variety than either, is found in <HI>Lorraine</HI> and <HI>Brie;</HI> it corre&s;ponds in &s;ize with tho&s;e found in England; but the white of the brea&s;t which terminates under the cheeks in the latter, pa&s;&s;es quite round the neck like a collar in the former <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This variety is called by Buffon <HI>Le Gobemouche noir &agrave; Collier.</HI> Hi&s;t. des Oi&s;. 4. p. 520. pl. 25. f. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The plumage of the female is brown in tho&s;e parts where the male is black; it has no white on the forehead; the white &s;pot on the wing is more ob&s;cure; and the under parts of the body is of a du&s;ky white. The male po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es only the full black during the &s;ummer; as that &s;ea&s;on declines, its plumage alters, and it gradually a&s;&s;umes &s;o per|fectly the appearance of the female, that he cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed from her.</P>
<P>The ne&s;t is u&s;ually built in the hole of a tree, not very near the ground; it is compo&s;ed of fibres, mixed with mo&s;s, and contains &s;ix eggs. It feeds on In&s;ects.</P>

<P>The&s;e Birds breed among tufts of ru&s;hes, gra&s;s, or mo&s;s near the water &s;ide; they lay three or four eggs, about an inch and three quarters in length, of a dull olive colour, marked with irregular black &s;pots, and &s;prinkled with &s;pecks of an ob&s;cure brown in June; the young birds are hatched in July, and quit the ne&s;t &s;oon after.</P>
<P>They feed on &s;mall fi&s;h and water in&s;ects; are very clamorous and daring; and during the time of incubation, will dart on any per&s;on who may pa&s;s by their ne&s;t, though they &s;hould neither provoke nor di&s;turb them.</P>

<P><PB REF="130">It feeds on &s;mall fi&s;h and in&s;ects: its ne&s;t is built among the &s;tones on the ground near the water &s;ide; beneath the &s;mall &s;helving rocks that over-hang the &s;treams it frequents; or in holes contrived in &s;teep and perpendicular banks; it is compo&s;ed of hay and fibres of roots, is lined with dead oak leaves, has a covering of green mo&s;s, and contains five eggs of a white colour with a blu&s;h of red. In young birds the belly is wholly white.</P>
