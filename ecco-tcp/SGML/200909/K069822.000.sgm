<HEAD>LETTER I. On the ab&s;urdity of <HI>Authoritative</HI> TOLERATION of <HI>gro&s;s Here&s;y, Bla&s;phemy</HI> or <HI>Idolatry.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW God him&s;elf connected religion, and the civil welfare of nations, in his ancient laws, almo&s;t the whole of the Old Te&s;tament doth bear witne&s;s. That religion is the great ba&s;is of civil happine&s;s, was the common, the avowed belief of e|very &s;en&s;ible Heathen: It was, for ought I know, the infamous mon&s;ter Tiberius, who fir&s;t pretended, <HI>That the Gods alone ought to regard or re&s;ent the injuries done them.</HI> Before the happy Reformation, the Popi&s;h clergy had reduced civil rulers into mere tools for exe|cuting their plea&s;ure in religious matters; and pre|tended that they <HI>had no power of judging</HI> in them. To free the&s;e rulers from &s;uch Antichri&s;tian claims, the Prote&s;tant reformers, every where, as their Confe&s;&s;i|ons of faith and other writings make evident, loudly maintained, That to magi&s;trates them&s;elves indepen|dent of clergymen, belongs a di&s;tingui&s;hed power in the <HI>reformation</HI> and <HI>pre&s;ervation</HI> of religion. Not long after, Era&s;tus, a German phy&s;ician and his fol|lowers, to curry favour with their re&s;pective princes, pretended, That magi&s;trates are the proper lords of the Chri&s;tian church, from whom her mini&s;ters and other rulers derive their whole power, and to whom they mu&s;t be accountable. This notion, exceedingly flattering their ambition, was too greedily embraced by mo&s;t of the Prote&s;tant princes; nor do I know of one Prote&s;tant church, which hath not &s;uffered by
<PB N="4" REF="4">
means of it. Meanwhile, the German Anabapti&s;ts, having experienced the frowns, and &s;ometimes the improper &s;everities of magi&s;trates, copied after the ancient Donati&s;ts in the like circum&s;tances, and warm|ly contended, That magi&s;trates have no more power about religious matters than any private per&s;on, and ought to puni&s;h none for different &s;entiments in doc|trine or forms of wor&s;hip. The Socinians and re|mon&s;trant Arminians, except when magi&s;trates favour|ed them&s;elves, and promoted their cau&s;e, zealou&s;ly contended for the &s;ame notion, at lea&s;t in the ca&s;e of mini&s;ters and wor&s;hip, which were not maintained at the public expence. Many, if not mo&s;t of the Eng|li&s;h Independents in the la&s;t century were much of the &s;ame mind; and hence, by their influence, &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ages in the We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith could ne|ver obtain a ratification by the Engli&s;h Parliament, or a place in their own <HI>Savoy Confe&s;&s;ion.</HI> Part of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, relative to the magi&s;trate's power, are al&s;o dropt from the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith agreed to by the Independents of New England in 1682. Mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters of this century &s;eem to be much of the &s;ame mind; e&s;pecially &s;uch as might otherwi&s;e have been expo&s;ed to danger on account of their open maintenance of Arian, Socinian, and Quakeri&s;h bla&s;|phemies&mdash;Locke and bi&s;hop Hoadly, and &s;ome others of the Epi&s;copalian party, warmly e&s;pou&s;ed the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This notion never received much countenance in Scotland, till Mr Gla&s;s of Tealing commenced a fu|rious new-fa&s;hioned Independent. He mightily con|tended, That the Jewi&s;h nation was an eccle&s;ia&s;tical one, and their kings eccle&s;ia&s;tical rulers; that Chri&s;|tian magi&s;trates have no more power in religious mat|ters than private Chri&s;tians, and ought not to employ their power in advancing the true religion, or in mak|ing laws with penalties in favour of it; or in re&s;training or puni&s;hing heretics or fal&s;e teachers, nor ought they to give more encouragement to good Chri&s;tians, than to other peaceable &s;ubjects;&mdash;that the example of the re|forming kings of Judah in puni&s;hing idolatry and fal&s;e wor&s;hip, and in promoting the true religion, is not now to be imitated; and that our fathers national
<PB N="5" REF="5">
covenanting again&s;t Popery and other wickedne&s;s, in favour of the true religion was <HI>unwarrantable,</HI> and is <HI>not binding</HI> upon us.&mdash;<HI>Dr. Wi&s;heart, Principal of the college of Edinburgh,</HI> in his &s;ermons contended, That magi&s;trates have only a right to puni&s;h &s;uch crimes as &s;trike immediately again&s;t the per&s;ons or property of men; but not to puni&s;h any thing which &s;trikes im|mediately again&s;t the honour of God, as bla&s;phe|my or here&s;y; that all men ought to have civil liber|ty to think and &s;peak as they plea&s;e, providing they make no attack upon the welfare of civil &s;ociety; that none ought to be hampered in their &s;earch after truth by any requirement of their &s;ub&s;criptions to <HI>Formu|las</HI> or <HI>Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith;</HI> that children in their edu|cation, ought never to be bia&s;&s;ed to a &s;ide by learning catechi&s;ms which maintain the peculiar principles of a party. The&s;e or the like notions have been adopt|ed by not a few of the pretenders to modern illumi|nation.</P>
<P>In her <HI>public Standards,</HI> the Church of Scotland hath renounced, and in her &s;olemn covenants hath abjured both the&s;e extremes. In her <HI>Old Confe&s;&s;ion of Faitb,</HI> which is expre&s;ly &s;worn to in the national cove|nant of 1581, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as <HI>in all points the undoubted truth of God,</HI> Art. xxiv, &s;he a&s;&s;erts, that <Q REND="inline">"the power and authority of magi&s;trates is God's <HI>holy ordinance,</HI> or|dained for manife&s;tation of his own glory, and for the &s;ingular profit of mankind&mdash;they are the <HI>lieutenants of God,</HI> in who&s;e &s;e&s;&s;ions God him&s;elf doth fit and judge&mdash;to whom by God is given the &s;word to the prai&s;e and defence of good men, and to puni&s;h all o|pen malefactors. To kings, princes, rulers and ma|gi&s;trates chiefly, and mo&s;t principally, the con&s;ervati|on and purgation of religion appertains; &s;o that not only are they appointed for civil policy, but al&s;o for maintenance of the true religion, and for &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of all idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition what&s;oever."</Q> This doctrine is further a&s;&s;erted and explained in her &s;econd book of di&s;cipline, chap. ix; The doctrine of her <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> the WHOLE of which is &s;olemnly e&s;pou&s;ed and engaged to, by every Pre&s;by|terian mini&s;ter and elder in Scotland in his ordination vows, is that <Q REND="inline">"for their publi&s;hing opinions or main|taining

For the better effecting of which, he hath power to call Synods, to be pre&s;ent at them, and to provide that what&s;oever is tran&s;acted in them be according to the mind of God," Chap. xxiii. 1, 2, 3.&mdash;</Q> <Q REND="inline">"The duties required in the &s;econd commandment are&mdash;the di&s;approving, dete&s;t|ing, oppo&s;ing all fal&s;e wor&s;hip, and according to each one's place and calling, removing it, and all monu|ments of idolatry;&mdash;The &s;ins forbidden in the &s;econd commandment are, all devi&s;ing, coun&s;elling, com|manding, u&s;ing, and any ways approving any religi|ous wor&s;hip not in&s;tituted by God him&s;elf, tolerating a fal&s;e religion." Lar. Cat. Q 108, 109.</Q> The&s;e de|clarations are an authentic explication of the power of the magi&s;trate in <HI>maintaining and pre&s;erving the true religion,</HI> the defence of which is expre&s;ly &s;worn in their &s;olemn covenants with God. If therefore, Sir, you di&s;credit this doctrine, and plead the toleration of idolatry, bla&s;phemy, here&s;y, and that magi&s;trates ought to meddle with nothing in religion, be &s;o ho|ne&s;t, as openly to renounce your ordination vows and

<P>To illu&s;trate the above doctrine of our excellent &s;tandards, it is proper to ob&s;erve, (1.) God alone is the nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent, and ab&s;olutely independent Creator and pre&s;erver, and therefore original and &s;u|preme proprietor and governor of all things in hea|ven or earth, Exod. iii. 4. Gen. i. P&s;al. civ. and xxiv. 1, 2. xxxiii. 6. lxxxiii. 18. xlvii. 2, 7, 9. Ezek. i. 11. Col. i. 16,&mdash;18. Dan. iv. 34, 35. (2.) All right, ci|vil, natural, or &s;piritual, whether of con&s;cience, or of per&s;ons, or of hu&s;bands, parents, ma&s;ters, magi&s;|trates, mini&s;ters, or even of Chri&s;t as mediator, mu&s;t therefore wholly originate from God alone, P&s;alm cxv. 16. Rom. ii. 36. Heb. ii. 10 Acts x. 25, 28. 2 Cor. v. 18. P&s;al. lxxv. 7. Dan. ii. 21. iv. 32, 35. Mat. xxviii. 18. ii. 27. John v. 35. To &s;uppo&s;e any real<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">right or being what&s;oever, unoriginating from him, is to give up with the nece&s;&s;ary exi&s;tence of God, and to plunge into the very <HI>depths of Athei&s;m.</HI> (3.) All right and authority of con&s;cience, per&s;ons, hu&s;|bands, parents, magi&s;trates, mini&s;ters, or even of Chri&s;t as mediator, being wholly derived from God, ought, nece&s;&s;arily ought, wholly to be improved, or exerci&s;ed in his name, in conformity and &s;ubordinati|on to his law, as the &s;upreme rule, and in order to promote his declarative glory as the chief end of it. Prov. xvi. 4 Rom ii. 30. 1 Pet. iv. 11. 1 Cor x. 31. John v. 30. viii. 29 vii. 18. Eph iii. 21 (4.) No right or authority derived from God can therefore be lawfully improven or exerci&s;ed, in protecting, encou|raging, allowing or commanding any thing which God him&s;elf, on account of his infinite perfection in holi|ne&s;s, ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s and truth, cannot command;&mdash;or in di&s;couraging, di&s;allowing, or prohibiting any thing which God in his law requires. It is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e it, that God can give men a power which he hath not him&s;elf; and &s;hocking bla&s;phemy to &s;up|po&s;e him capable of giving men a right and authority to contemn or counteract his own law as their rule, or his own glory as their chief end, in every thing they do, 2 Tim. ii. 13. Hab. i. 12, 13. Exod, xv. 11. Deut. xxxii. 4. Zeph. iii. 5. James i. 13. (5.) All the diver&s;ified forms of right and authority in con&s;cience,
<PB N="8" REF="8">
hu&s;bands, parents, ma&s;ters, magi&s;trates, mini&s;ters, and even in Chri&s;t as mediator, being derived from the <HI>&s;ame God of infinite wi&s;dom and order,</HI> each of them may, and ought to be wholly exerci&s;ed within its proper de|partment, and in a manner an&s;werable to its nature, and never in the way of invading the place or inter|rupting the exerci&s;e of any other right or authority. No right of con&s;cience can be exerci&s;ed to the inter|ruption of the due exerci&s;e of marital, parental, ma|gi&s;terial, magi&s;tratical, mini&s;terial, or Chri&s;t's media|torial authority; nor, can any regular exerci&s;e of the&s;e powers interrupt the due exerci&s;e of the power of con&s;cience, or of one another, 1 Cor. xiv. 33, 40. vii. 20, 24. (6.) All the&s;e different forms of power and authority being derived from the <HI>&s;ame God,</HI> may have the &s;ame things for their object, but viewed in different re&s;pects. The &s;ame man may be &s;ubject to the power of his con&s;cience as he is a rational crea|ture,&mdash;&s;ubject to the power of parents as a child,&mdash;&s;ubject to the power of ma&s;ters as a &s;ervant,&mdash;&s;ubject to the power of magi&s;trates as a member of the com|monwealth,&mdash;&s;ubject to the power of church-rulers as a member of an organized vi&s;ible church,&mdash;&s;ubject to the mediatorial power of Chri&s;t, as a member of his my&s;tical body, or an agent for promoting the wel|fare of it.&mdash;The &s;ame good work of piety or virtue may, or ought to be required by con&s;cience, by pa|rents, ma&s;ters, magi&s;trates, mini&s;ters, and even by Chri&s;t as mediator, in different re&s;pects, as calculated to promote the welfare of the per&s;ons, families, nati|ons, and churches concerned,&mdash;in &s;ubordination to the glory of God as their re&s;pective proprietor and &s;uperior. The performance of the &s;ame good work may be encouraged by rewards from all the&s;e diffe|rent powers, an&s;werable to their re&s;pective forms.&mdash;The &s;ame vices of idolatry, bla&s;phemy, calumny, trea|&s;on, theft, murder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as in different re&s;pects hurt|ful to per&s;ons, families, civil &s;ocieties, and churches, may, and ought to be prohibited by all the&s;e different powers, and re&s;ented by each, as hurtful to it&s;elf, as &s;ubordinated to God,&mdash;in a manner an&s;werable to its particular nature and department,&mdash;by con&s;cience with &s;tinging rebukes,&mdash;by parents with correction, di&s;in|heriting,
<PB N="9" REF="9">
or the like,&mdash;by ma&s;ters with frowns, &s;tripes, abridgment of wages, or the like,&mdash;by magi&s;trates with public di&s;honour, fining, impri&s;onment, or death,&mdash;by church rulers with eccle&s;ia&s;tical rebuke, excom|munication,&mdash;by Chri&s;t with temporal, &s;piritual or eternal judgment, Acts xxiv. 16. Jo&s;h xxiv. 15. P&s;al. ci. Mat. v, vi, vii, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (7.) All the&s;e powers of con&s;cience, hu&s;bands, parents, ma&s;ters, magi&s;trates, church-rulers, and of Chri&s;t as mediator, proceeding from an infinitely wi&s;e, powerful and good God, are each of them, in its own place, altogether &s;ufficient to gain its own end.&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, it mightily tends to the advantage of each, that all of them be rightly exerci&s;ed at once, and to the hurt o&s; all the re&s;t, if any of them be not. If con&s;cience act faithfully, this promotes the regular and comfortable exerci&s;e of the power of hu&s;bands, parents, ma&s;ters, magi&s;trates or mini&s;ters. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And it is to the advantage of con&s;ci|ence, if they regularly exerci&s;e their power, and e&s;pe|cially if Chri&s;t exerci&s;e his, in a remarkable manner. It is much to the advantage of Church and State, if hu&s;bands, parents, and ma&s;ters, faithfully exerci&s;e their power in their re&s;pective departments; and much to their hurt, if they do not. If the rulers in Church and State, faithfully di&s;charge their tru&s;t, it will tend much to promote the welfare of families. The more faithfully mini&s;ters labour in winning &s;ouls to Chri&s;t, and teaching men to live &s;oberly, righte|ou&s;ly and godly in view of Chri&s;t's &s;econd coming, the more ea&s;y will the work of magi&s;trates, and the great|er the happine&s;s of the commonwealth be.&mdash;The more faithfully magi&s;trates act in curbing of crimes, and promoting obedience to God the King of nations, as a mean of &s;ecuring his felicitating ble&s;&s;ing to the commonwealth, the more delightfully will church-power be exerci&s;ed, and the more abundantly it will tend to the welfare of the church. Nay, though the mediatorial power of Chri&s;t be infinitely &s;ufficient in its own place, to an&s;wer its own ends, yet the delight|ful exerci&s;e and &s;ucce&s;s of it is not a little promoted by the faithful exerci&s;e of the powers of con&s;cience, hu&s;bands, parents, ma&s;ters, magi&s;trates and church-rulers, Acts xxiv. 16. 1 Tim. i. 5. Eph. iv,&mdash;vi. Col.
<PB N="10" REF="10">
iii. iv. 1 &amp; 2 Tim. Titus i.&mdash;iii. 1 Pet. ii.&mdash;v. P&s;alm ii. 10, 12. Rev. ii. 15. xvii. 14, 16. xxi. 24. I&s;a. xlix. 23. lx, 3, 4, 10, 16. (8.) Though the marital, pa|rental, magi&s;terial, magi&s;tratical, and mini&s;terial pow|ers be altogether di&s;tinct from, and independent of one another, and each of them have its own particu|lar exerci&s;es pertaining to it alone;&mdash;yet the &s;ame per|&s;on, in re&s;pect of different relations, may be at once &s;uperior or inferior to another per&s;on,&mdash;and &s;o may be required to fulfil the particular duties of his &s;tation, by one who hath not any lawful right to perform them him&s;elf. Thus magi&s;trates and mini&s;ters as &s;uch, may require hu&s;bands to perform their duties to their wives, parents to perform theirs to their children, or ma&s;ters theirs to their &s;ervants, as a mean of promot|ing the welfare of the commonwealth and of the church, in obedience to God, and aiming at his glo|ry. An uncrowned hu&s;band of a queen may com|mand her, faithfully to exerci&s;e her magi&s;tratical power, as a means of honour and happine&s;s to his family; and &s;he as queen may command him in eve|ry thing relating to the welfare of the &s;tate, as her of|ficer or &s;ubject. A parent may require his &s;on, as &s;uch, faithfully to exerci&s;e his mini&s;terial, magi&s;tra|tical, or magi&s;terial power as a mean of honour and happine&s;s to his family. A &s;on may command his fa|ther, who is his &s;ervant, in every thing pertaining to the &s;ervice due from him, and even to order his fami|ly aright, in &s;o far as it tends to promote that &s;ervice. Mini&s;ters, as the amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t, have power to require magi&s;trates, <HI>as church members,</HI> faithfully to exerci&s;e their magi&s;tratical power, &s;o as may be&s;t promote the honour of Chri&s;t, and the welfare of his church. And on the other hand, magi&s;trates have power to require mini&s;ters <HI>as their &s;ubjects,</HI> faithfully to exerci&s;e their mini&s;terial power, as a mean of ren|dering the nation pious and virtuous, in order to pro|mote its happine&s;s,&mdash;and all this in &s;ubordination to the law, and to promote the glory of God as the &s;u|preme governor of families, churches, or nations. (9.) Though the marital, parental, magi&s;terial, ma|gi&s;tratical and mini&s;terial powers, have, each of them,
<PB N="11" REF="11">
&s;omething for its peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing object, in which no other power can interfere with it;&mdash;Thus it is always unlawful for hu&s;bands, parents, ma&s;|ters or mini&s;ters, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> to a&s;&s;ume the power of civil magi&s;trates in levying taxes, adjudging criminals to death,&mdash;always unlawful for parents, ma&s;ters, or ma|gi&s;trates, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> to preach the go&s;pel, di&s;pen&s;e &s;acra|ments; or church-cen&s;ures;&mdash;yet if the exerci&s;e of &s;ome of the&s;e powers be fearfully neglected or abu&s;ed, the other powers may be exerci&s;ed, in order to rec|tify the di&s;orders occa&s;ioned, further than would be proper if there were no &s;uch neglect, abu&s;e, or di&s;|order. Thus if hu&s;bands, parents, or ma&s;ters, fear|fully abu&s;e their power, relative to wives, children, or &s;ervants, the rulers of church or &s;tate, for the be|nefit of the&s;e &s;ocieties, may interfere more with their family-concerns, than would be proper in other cir|cum&s;tances. If church-rulers be notoriou&s;ly negli|gent or wicked, magi&s;trates <HI>as church-members,</HI> and to <HI>promote the welfare of the &s;tate,</HI> may do more in the re|formation of the church, than would be proper for them, if church rulers were diligent and faithful. And, if through the indolence or wickedne&s;s of ma|gi&s;trates, the affairs of the nation be thrown into terri|ble confu&s;ion, mini&s;ters <HI>as members of the commonwealth, and to promote the welfare of the church,</HI> may do more in the rectification of affairs, than would be proper, if the magi&s;trates were faithful, 2 Kings xi. 2 Chron. xxiii (10.) All governing authority empowers the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it, to i&s;&s;ue forth laws or commandments, binding on the &s;ubject of it. But the&s;e laws or com|mandments can extend their binding force no further, than the particular department belonging to that pow|er, as by that, every particular form of authority, de|rived from God, is limited. The laws or command|ments of parents, ma&s;ters, magi&s;trates, and church-rulers, extend only to external things in the family, commonwealth, or church. The&s;e of con&s;cience and of Chri&s;t extend al&s;o to that which is inward in the heart.&mdash;And as all human &s;uperiors are imperfect in knowledge them&s;elves, and cannot enable their &s;ub|jects perfectly to under&s;tand their whole duty, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that laws of families or nations, or con&s;tituti|ons

of churches require <HI>nothing but what is plainly a|greeable to the law of God,</HI> and nothing in religion but what is <HI>plainly required by the word of God,</HI> that &s;o no|thing may be contrary to the&s;e laws but what is not only <HI>really,</HI> but <HI>plainly</HI> contrary to the word of God. And, the weaker the &s;ubjects are, the more conde|&s;cen&s;ion ought to be exerci&s;ed towards them in this matter, Rom. xv, 1, 2. (11.) As men cannot bow the hearts of their inferiors unto &s;ubjection, they ought always to i&s;&s;ue forth their commandments in the mo&s;t prudent, mild and gaining manner. It is very im|proper to i&s;&s;ue forth any law doubtful or ob&s;cure, or which mo&s;t of the &s;ubjects are not likely to be got peaceably to comply with. This ought e&s;pecially to be attended to, in the framing and impo&s;ing of <HI>laws and con&s;titutions relative to religion,</HI> which ought to be a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> and <HI>voluntary</HI> &s;ervice. (12) As noth|ing, particularly in religion, ought to be contrary to any law of church or &s;tate but what is plainly con|trary to the law of God; and nothing ought to be held <HI>cen&s;urable</HI> by the laws of the church, or <HI>puni&s;hable</HI> by the laws of the &s;tate, but what is <HI>plainly contrary</HI> to the&s;e laws, and hath become <HI>duly public,</HI> in the pro|vidence of God, without requiring the party concern|ed to be his own accu&s;er.&mdash;So, on account of the weakne&s;s or number of the offenders, or the di&s;order|ed &s;tate of the &s;ociety, <HI>many real &s;candals</HI> in the church mu&s;t be forborne without centure, and <HI>many real crimes</HI> again&s;t the &s;tate forborne without puni&s;hment; notwith&s;tanding, it would be extremely wicked, <HI>au|thoritatively</HI> to licen&s;e or tolerate them in either. If your children be very young, raving in a fever, deli|rious, or apt to fall into convul&s;ive fits, it might be very prudent and dutiful for you to forbear &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement of them for playing on the Lord's day; repeating &s;ome wicked expre&s;&s;ions, they had heard from their fellow children, or the like. But would it be lawful in you to give them a parental licence to profane the Sabbath or name of God, and promi&s;e them protection in &s;o doing? You dare not pretend it. God him&s;elf wi&s;ely forbears the puni&s;hment of many things, which his law forbids. (13.) As it is never errors or corruptions <HI>of the heart,</HI> but wick|ed

words and deeds, &s;ufficiently and regularly mani|fe&s;ted, which are to be corrected in families, puni&s;h|ed in commonwealths, or cen&s;ured in churches, Deut. xiii. 1,&mdash;14. xvii. 46. Heb. x. 28. 1 Tim. v. 1&mdash;So even in puni&s;hing manife&s;t crimes, e&s;pecially in mat|ters of religion, all proper mildne&s;s ought to be exer|ci&s;ed, never proceeding to extremities, where there is any hope of reformation, or where, as in the ca&s;e of here&s;y or bla&s;phemy, confe&s;&s;ion and repentance can make any kind of re&s;titution, Mat. xviii. 15,&mdash;18. Among the Hebrews, not one appears to have been puni&s;hed for idolatry, if he profe&s;&s;ed repentance and reformation. The princes of I&s;rael fir&s;t attempted to bring the Reubenites and Gadites, whom they &s;up|po&s;ed guilty of it, to repentance, Jo&s;h. xxii. Never in the reformation by A&s;a, Hezekiah, or Jofiah, have we one in&s;tance of a penitent idolater &s;lain. The idolaters condemned to death, Deut. xiii. xvii. are re|pre&s;ented as <HI>men of Belial,</HI> pre&s;umptuous, and ob&s;ti|nate in their wickedne&s;s. The prophets of Baal whom Elijah cau&s;ed be put to death, 1 Kings xviii. 40. and Mattan the prie&s;t, who was &s;lain by Jehoiada's or|ders, 2 Kings xi. 18. were no doubt of this &s;ort; and probably al&s;o guilty of promoting the murder of the Lord's prophets and people. The man put to death for profanation of the Sabbath, appears to have acted pre&s;umptuou&s;ly, Num. xv. 30,&mdash;36. A&s;a and his &s;ubjects covenanted to put to death &s;uch as ob&s;tinately adhered to idolatry, 2 Chron. xv. 12, 13. (14.) Ma|gi&s;trates ought never to attempt <HI>forcing</HI> men to believe with their hearts, even the mo&s;t fundamental truths of religion, or to practi&s;e any religious duty,&mdash;that be|ing no means appointed by God for convincing them of the truth, or inducing them to a cordial perfor|mance of religious duties, 2 Cor. x. 4, 5. But it would be highly ab&s;urd, hence to infer, That magi&s;|trates <HI>may not re&s;train</HI> men from robbing nations or churches of tho&s;e divine truths, which God hath gra|ciou&s;ly entru&s;ted to them, and which are inexpre&s;&s;i|bly profitable to them,&mdash;or <HI>re&s;train</HI> them from propa|gating gro&s;s here&s;ies, bla&s;phemies, idolatries, which undermine and exclude the true religion, provoke God o de&s;troy nations, and are the fruitful &s;eeds of

<P>It is, therefore, extremely uncandid in the advocates for magi&s;tratical tolerations of here&s;y, bla&s;phemy, and idolatry, always to attempt blending or placing on an equal level, <HI>true</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e</HI> religion,&mdash;<HI>mere neglect</HI> of &s;ome po&s;itive duties of religion, and <HI>&s;hocking in&s;ults</HI> u|pon, and <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> to the duties of religion,&mdash;<HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> and <HI>&s;ecret mi&s;takes</HI> in religion, and the <HI>mo&s;t damnable</HI> here&s;ies, bla&s;phemies, and idolatries, openly and ob|&s;tinately profe&s;&s;ed and practi&s;ed, as if the&s;e were e|qually objects of toleration, re&s;traint, or puni&s;hment,&mdash;or, to confound a <HI>mere forbearance</HI> to puni&s;h, with an <HI>authoritative licence,</HI> openly to pro&s;e&s;s and practi&s;e what is criminal re&s;pecting religion. The true religion ought never to need a toleration. It ought always to have an e&s;tabli&s;hment. Whereas a fal&s;e one ought never to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, magi&s;trates having no power again&s;t the truth but for the truth. There are <HI>many mere neglects</HI> or <HI>le&s;&s;er mi&s;takes</HI> in religion, again&s;t which it would not be proper for magi&s;trates to enact civil laws, in this pre&s;ent &s;tate of imperfection.

may have as ju&s;t a view of the &s;criptures as our&s;elves, and never to condemn them for that which they do not own to be bla&s;phemy, idolatry, or here&s;y. (5.) Magi&s;trates right and authority to govern others, doth not originate in God as the Creator, Pre&s;erver, and King of nations, but in magi&s;trates them&s;elves, <HI>or in their &s;ubjects;</HI> and &s;o may be exerci&s;ed as they plea&s;e, particularly in requiring or allowing their &s;ub|jects to belie, bla&s;pheme, or rob God. (6) Magi&s;|trates may be moral governors deputies or lieutenants, under God, without having any power or authority relating to religion, or his honour. (7.) Not the law of God natural or revealed, but the laws of nations ought to be the <HI>&s;upreme</HI> &s;tandard of all civil govern|ment. (8.) Not the declarative glory of God, as the Mo&s;t High over all the earth, but the civil peace and pro&s;perity of nations, ought to be the <HI>chief end</HI> of ma|gi&s;trates in all their acts of government.

Acts xx 30. (4.) It marks a heavy judgment of God upon, and an anarchy in a commonwealth, when every man is left without re&s;traint, and doth that which is right in his own eyes, in matters of religion, Judges xvii. 6. Zech. xi. 9, 16. 2 Chron. xx. 33. Amos iv. 4, 5. (5.) In granting <HI>&s;uch liberty,</HI> magi&s;trates are not for Chri&s;t, by whom they rule, Prov. viii. 15, 16. but again&s;t him, in encouraging and protecting the doctrines and works of the devil, which he came to de&s;troy, John viii. 44. 1 Tim. iv. 2.

Ezek. xiii. 4, 5. and xxii. 30, 31. (9.) Magi&s;trates indulgence of a fal&s;e religion is repre&s;ented as <HI>a kicking</HI> at the true religion, and <HI>an honouring</HI> of the corrupters <HI>above God,</HI> and brings a charge of the wickedne&s;s upon the tolerators of it.

<P N="3">III. The &s;criptures repre&s;ent magi&s;trates as having power to make civil laws relative to the external con|cerns of religion &s;ubordinated to the law of God, and an&s;werable to their own department.

It is never hinted, that they have no charge with re&s;pect to religion, but the contrary. God cho&s;e Mo&s;es the magi&s;trate, not Aaron the High-prie&s;t to publi&s;h his laws relative to religion.&mdash;Abijah avers, that in maintaining the true wor&s;hip of God, he had kept the charge of the Lord, which Jeroboam the introducer of a fal&s;e reli|gion had not, 2 Chron xiii. 10, 11. (2.) God pro|mi&s;ed to the Jews good magi&s;trates, in order to root out abu&s;ive practices and monuments of fal&s;e religion, I&s;a i. 25, 26. Now, if they had power to root the&s;e out, they had certainly power to make laws for that effect. (3.) They ought to repeal wicked and per&s;e|cuting

laws, and free their &s;ubjects from being bound over to puni&s;hment by them for their faithful &s;ervice of God, P&s;alm xciv. 20. I&s;a. x. 11. Mic. vi. 16. Ho&s;. v. 11. If they can repeal wicked laws, they mu&s;t have power to e&s;tabli&s;h what is contrary to them, Dan. iii. and vi. (4) If magi&s;trates can make laws encou|raging the true religion and church of Chri&s;t, by an|nexation of civil favours to the profe&s;&s;ion or practice of go&s;pel-truth; they can al&s;o by law annex civil pu|ni&s;hment to the contempt of, or rebellion again&s;t the&s;e laws; they being for the <HI>terror and puni&s;hment of evil doers,</HI> as well as for the <HI>prai&s;e of them that do well,</HI> Rom. xiii. 3, 4. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14 Dan. vi. 16. iii. 29. Ezra i. 1,&mdash;5. vi. 3,&mdash;12. vii. 23,&mdash;27. (5) By enacting &s;uch laws they neither invade the office of eccle&s;ia&s;tical rulers, who have no power to connect civil rewards or puni&s;hments, with any thing religious,&mdash;nor do they tran&s;gre&s;s any law of God.&mdash;What then can hinder their having power to make them? (6.) If all &s;orts of men, church members and officers, as well as others, be &s;ubject to civil magi&s;trates, they mu&s;t have power, and ought to make civil laws calcu|lated to promote their advantage, in all the&s;e &s;tations, Rom. xiii. 1,&mdash;4. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14. 1 Tim. ii 1, 2. (7.) Unle&s;s magi&s;trates have a power to make good laws relative to the external profe&s;&s;ion and practice of religion, clergymen, if generally corrupt, will have it in their power, by Synodical con&s;titutions, or other|wi&s;e, to devour and poi&s;on their &s;ubjects, with the &s;eeds of confu&s;ion, profanene&s;s, and every evil work, without any po&s;&s;ibility of any legal re&s;traint. For to allow magi&s;trates to act without law, is to introduce tyranny and arbitrary government.</P>
<P>But, in magi&s;trates making laws re&s;pecting religion, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that [1.] They, fir&s;t in order, care|fully acquaint them&s;elves with the law of God, that they may form all their laws in agreeablene&s;s and &s;u|bordination to it,&mdash;they having no power again&s;t the truth, but for it, Deut. xvii. 18,&mdash;20.

In fine, it plunges men into the depths of Athei&s;m, according to which every man be|lieves and acts what is right in his own eyes. [7] If mens private judgment of their own acts hindered the magi&s;trates &s;upreme <HI>political</HI> judgment, no laws could be made in matters of religion or any thing el&s;e; as &s;ome would be readily of a different mind, even in the fundamentals of religion and virtue.&mdash;While &s;ome believed that Chri&s;t was not true God or true man, or that idols might be wor&s;hipped, others would believe that oaths might be lawfully violated, heretical princes a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, or women and goods u&s;ed in com|mon.

In performing the duty of our natural or civil relations, we mu&s;t act as <HI>mere de|i&s;ts,</HI> ignorant of, or pouring contempt on the in&s;pired oracles of the Great GOD, our Saviour.&mdash;What hurt have the laws of revelation done to &s;uch relative duties, that they mu&s;t be thus infamou&s;ly excluded from being any part of a rule of them? (3) No man can truly obey the law of nature, without heartily em|bracing and chearfully improving whatever revelations God is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on him,&mdash;as &s;uch revelations proceed from the &s;ame divine authority as the law of nature; and mu&s;t be a noted means of promoting true and proper obedience to it.&mdash;To exclude divine reve|lation, when granted, from regulating our perfor|mance of relative duties, mu&s;t therefore not only a|mount to an <HI>heatheni&s;h</HI> contempt of the &s;criptures, but to an <HI>athei&s;tical</HI> contempt of the law of nature, which nece&s;&s;arily requires us to adopt divine Revelation for our &s;upreme rule, whenever it is graciou&s;ly granted to us.</P>

Jewi&s;h nation al&s;o exerci&s;ed laws relative to murder, theft, uncha&s;tity, trea&s;on, and other matters of the &s;econd table of the moral law. Ought therefore no magi&s;trates now to do &s;o? The laws re&s;pecting duties of the &s;econd table pertained as much to the Jewi&s;h Theocracy, as tho&s;e relating to the fir&s;t. Mu&s;t there|fore the Chri&s;tian magi&s;trate, for fear of copying the Jewi&s;h Theocracy, meddle with no morality at all? [3.] Mu&s;t every thing that was once typical, be now, under the go&s;pel, excluded from regulating authority? Mu&s;t all the excellent patterns of Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob, Jo&s;eph, Job. Mo&s;es, Aaron, Samuel, David, and other Hebrew &s;aints be rejected as typical and u&s;ele&s;s?&mdash;Mu&s;t all the laws directing to elect men, <HI>fearing God, and hating covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> to be magi&s;trates, or directing them to judge ju&s;tly, im|partially and prudently, and to puni&s;h murderers, a|dulterers, thieves, robbers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be di&s;carded as typi|cal? Mu&s;t the weekly Sabbath, public fa&s;ts and thank&s;|givings be laid a&s;ide as typical,&mdash;a mere &s;ign between God and the I&s;raelites? Mu&s;t the ten commandments, and all the explications of them in the Old Te&s;tament be di&s;carded, as publi&s;hed in a typical manner, and to a typical people, and u&s;ed as the principal part of their rule of government in the Jewi&s;h Theocracy? [4] As the Jewi&s;h church was a REAL church, and not MERELY TYPICAL, &s;o their State was a REAL commonwealth or kingdom, and not MERELY TY|PICAL. Whatever therefore pertained to it, <HI>as a real commonwealth,</HI> is imitable in any other. [5.] The Jewi&s;h Church and State were as REALLY DIS|TINCT, as the Church and State are now; though I do not &s;ay preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner. (1.) They differed in re&s;pect of REGULATING LAWS. The ceremonial law directed the Jewi&s;h church. The ju|dicial directed the affairs of their &s;tate. (2.) They differed in their re&s;pective ACTS. The Jews wor&s;hip|ped God, offered &s;acrifices, and received &s;acraments, not as members of that &s;tate, but as members of that church. They puni&s;hed evil doers by fines, im|pri&s;onment, bani&s;hment, burning, &s;toning, and hang|ing; and fought with enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not as a church,
<PB N="59" REF="59">
but as a &s;tate. (3.) They differed in re&s;pect of CON|TROVERSIES. To the church pertained the <HI>matters of the Lord,</HI> and a judging of lepro&s;ies, and between &s;tatutes and judgments. To the &s;tate belonged the <HI>matters of the king,</HI> and to judge between blood and blood, 2 Chron. xix. 10, 11. Deut. xvii. 8. (4) They differed in re&s;pect of OFFICERS. The prie&s;ts were the only &s;tated officers in the church, and pro|phets a kind of occa&s;ional ones. Elders, Judges and Kings were governors in the State. The prie&s;ts might not take the civil &s;word out of the hand of the ma|gi&s;trates; nor the magi&s;trates offer &s;acrifices, burn in|cen&s;e, or otherwi&s;e execute the prie&s;t's office. (5.) They differed in re&s;pect of CONTINUANCE. When the Jewi&s;h civil power was taken away by the Ro|mans, the con&s;titution of their church remained, in the days of our Saviour's deba&s;ement. And even now the Jews pretend to be a church, but not to be a &s;tate. (6.) They differed in re&s;pect of VARIATION. The con&s;titution of their church remained much the &s;ame under Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, the Judges, the Kings, and after the captivity. But the form of the &s;tate underwent great alterations. (7.) They differed in re&s;pect of MEMBERS. Pro&s;elytes of the covenant were complete members of the Jewi&s;h church; but had not the &s;ame dignities or marriages allowed them in the State, as the natural I&s;raelites. Nor had the pro&s;elytes of the gate any church privileges, though they had &s;ome civil ones. (8.) They were governed by different COURTS. The church had her courts of the Synagogue, and her eccle&s;ia&s;tical Sanhedrin.&mdash;The &s;tate had her courts of the gate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and her civil Sanhedrin;&mdash;though often &s;ome Levites were judges in both, as our ruling elders in the church, may, at the &s;ame time, be civil judges, Exod. xxiv. 1.

The manife&s;ted will of God was the proper &s;tatute book of the Jewi&s;h civil law, Deut. xvii. The will of God manife&s;ted in the laws of nature and revelation, are the &s;upreme &s;tandard of all civil laws in the world, in which every human con&s;titution ought to be founded, and by which the whole binding force of it is circum&s;cribed, Acts iv. 19. &amp; v. 29.

The Jewi&s;h magi&s;trates were appointed to promote the wel|fare of the church, in order to promote the welfare of the &s;tate, in &s;ubordination to the honour of God, the King of the nation.

Rom. xiii. 1,&mdash;6. 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14. 1 Tim. ii. 1,&mdash;4. (10.) The Jewi&s;h church and &s;tate, as hath been ju&s;t

(11.) Neverthele&s;s, the purity of the Jewi&s;h church, contributed much to the welfare of their &s;tate, and the right management of their &s;tate to the pro&s;perity of their church; and bad manage|ment in the one always tended to the hurt of the other, Deut. xxviii,&mdash;xxxii Lev. xxvi.

God never commanded the Jewi&s;h magi&s;trates to <HI>force</HI> their true religion upon their Heathen neighbours, Phili|&s;tines, Moabites, Ammonites, or Syrians, whom they conquered, or to put them to death for their idolatry.

(14) Among the Jews, &s;ome things partaking of both a civil and religi|ous nature, did, in the&s;e different re&s;pects, fall under the government of both Church and State.

1. Civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical power differ in their FOUN|DATION.

Is it <HI>&s;o &s;pi|ritual,</HI> as to exclude the Mo&s;t High, King of nations, and his deputed vicegerents, from all regard to the honour of God and his religion, and the welfare of the State as connected therewith, leaving them no more concern therewith, than if nations were herds of &s;wine? The que&s;tion under con&s;ideration is not concerning the nature of Chri&s;t's kingdom, of which the civil magi&s;trate is not a ruler of any kind, as hath been already manife&s;ted, but, Whether all care about the church and her religion, as tending to promote the welfare of nations ought to be excluded from <HI>God's kingdom,</HI> as the <HI>Sovereign of nations,</HI> and he and his vicegerents obliged to manage that department, as if there were no God in the earth?

(4.) Though the weapons of mini&s;ters warfare, in propagating the go&s;pel be not carnal, What is that to the ca&s;e of magi&s;trates?

Magi&s;tratical influence cannot &s;et up Chri&s;t's kingdom in mens heart, or o|blige mens con&s;cience to obey his laws in an acceptable manner; but it can remove many external hindran|ces, and afford many external opportunities, of his own &s;etting up, by means of his word and Spirit.

Being treacherou&s;ly and cruelly oppo&s;ed in their re|formation of religion, by their two Popi&s;h Queens, the Prote&s;tant Lords and others in Scotland, entered into five &s;everal bonds, A. D. 1557, 1559, 1560, 1563, in which they &s;olemnly engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t and protect each other, in promoting the free exerci&s;e of the Prote&s;tant religion. It was only the &s;maller part of the Prote&s;tants in our land, which entered into the&s;e bonds,&mdash;nor doth it appear, they were intended as ge|neral obligations.&mdash;But, when the Papi&s;ts abroad were labouring, with all their might, to extirpate the Pro|te&s;tant religion; and the Pope was found to have granted di&s;pen&s;ations for qualifying his votaries, to undermine it in our land,&mdash;the <HI>National Covenant</HI> was formed and &s;worn in 1581&mdash;in order to fru&s;trate their attempts, and &s;ecure the reformation attained. In it the abominations of Popery were expre&s;ly and parti|cularly abjured; and it was under&s;tood as adhered to and renewed in every religious bond that &s;ollowed. After God had marvellou&s;ly fru&s;trated the attempts of the Spaniards and other Papi&s;ts again&s;t Britain, our fathers, in thankfulne&s;s to Him,&mdash;and to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t the Popi&s;h confederates abroad, and their friends at home,&mdash;with much unanimity and joy renewed their <HI>National Covenant,</HI> A.

In 1596, apprehen&s;ions of danger from the Po|pi&s;h Lords, and the treacherous regard &s;hewed them by K.

to them, by an act of his will, and is implied in his giving them &s;uch a nature and &s;tation, it is plain, that no human laws of authority, or &s;elf-engagement, can have any obligation or binding force, but what are re|gulated by and &s;ubordinated to the divine laws of na|ture or revelation, 2 Cor. xiii. 8. and that, if &s;uch laws and engagements be lawful, God, not only doth, but mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ratify them, his law requiring the ful&s;ilment of them, under pain of his highe&s;t di&s;|plea&s;ure, Rom. xiii. 1,&mdash;6.

<P>As no <HI>deputed authority</HI> derived from God, can increa&s;e that &s;upreme, that infinite authority, which he hath in him&s;elf; &s;o no human command or engagement can increa&s;e that infinite obligation to duty, which his law hath <HI>in it&s;elf.</HI> But, if lawful, they have in them a <HI>real obligation, di&s;tinct,</HI> though neither <HI>&s;eparated</HI> nor <HI>&s;eparable,</HI> from the obligation of God's law.

<P>The <HI>intrin&s;ic obligation</HI> of promi&s;es, oaths, vows, and covenants which con&s;titutes their very e&s;&s;ence or e&s;&s;ential form, is totally and manife&s;tly di&s;tinct from the obligation of the law of God in many re&s;pects. (1.) In his law, God, by the declaration of his will, as our &s;upreme Ruler, binds us, Deut. xii. 32. In promi&s;es, vows, covenants, and promi&s;&s;ory oaths, we, as his deputy-governors over our&s;elves, by a declaration of our will, <HI>bind our&s;elves with a bond, bind our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">uls with our own bond, our own vow,</HI> Num, xxx. P&s;alm lxvi. 13, 15 &amp; cxix. 106, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (2.) The obligation of our promi&s;es, oaths and covenants is alway &s;ubject to examination by the &s;tandard of God's law, as to both its matter and manner, 1 The&s;&s;. v. 21. But it would be pre&s;umption, bla&s;phemous pre&s;umption, to examine, Whether, what we know to be the law of God be right and obligatory, or not, James iv. 11, 12. I&s;a. viii. 20. Deut. v. 32. (3.) The law of God ne|ce&s;&s;arily binds all men to the <HI>mo&s;t ab&s;olute perfection in holine&s;s,</HI> be they as incapable of it as they will, Matth. v. 48. 1 Pet. i. 15, 16. No man can, without mock|ing and tempting of God, bind him&s;elf by vow or oath to any thing, but what he is able to perform. No man may vow to do any thing which is not in his own power, and for the performance of which he hath no promi&s;e of ability from God. But, no mere man &s;ince the fall is able, in this life either in him&s;elf or by any grace received from God, <HI>perfectly</HI> to keep the commandments of God, Eccl. vii. 20 James iii. 2. While God remains God, his law can demand no le&s;s than ab&s;olute perfection in holine&s;s. While his word remains true, no mere man &s;ince the fall, in this life, can po&s;&s;ibly attain to it; and therefore ought never to promi&s;e or vow it. The lea&s;t imperfection in holi|ne&s;s, however involuntary, breaks the law of God, and is even contrary to the duty of our relative &s;tati|ons of hu&s;hands, parents, ma&s;ters, magi&s;trates, mini|&s;ters, wives, children, &s;ervants or people, 1 John iii. 4. Rom. vii. 14, 23, 24. But it is only by that
<PB N="101" REF="101">
which is, in &s;ome re&s;pect, <HI>voluntary &s;infulne&s;s,</HI> that we break our lawful vows, P&s;al. xliv. 47. Nothing can more clearly mark the di&s;tinction of the two obligati|ons, than this particular. There is no evading the force of it, but either by adopting the Arminian <HI>new law</HI> of &s;incere obedience, or by adopting the Popi&s;h perfection of &s;aints in this life. (4.) The law of God binds <HI>all men for ever,</HI> whether in heaven or hell, P&s;al. iii. 7, 8. No human law or &s;elf-engagement binds men, but <HI>only in this life,</HI> in which they remain imperfect, and are encompa&s;&s;ed with temptations to &s;educe them from their duty. In heaven they have no need of &s;uch helps to duty, and in hell they can|not be profited by them.</P>
<P>The obligation of lawful promi&s;es, oaths, vows and covenants, as well as of human laws, re&s;pecting moral duties, however <HI>di&s;tinct,</HI> is no more &s;eparable from the obligation of God's law, than Chri&s;t's <HI>two di&s;tinct natures</HI> are &s;eparable, the one from the other, but clo&s;ely connected in manifold re&s;pects. In binding our&s;elves to nece&s;&s;ary duties, and to other things &s;o long and &s;o far as is conducive thereto, God's law as the only rule to direct us how to glorify and enjoy him, is made the rule of our engagement. Our vow is no <HI>new rule</HI> of duty, but a <HI>new</HI> bond to make the law of God <HI>our rule.</HI> Even Adam's engagement to perfect obedience in the covenant of works was noth|ing el&s;e. His &s;allibility in his e&s;tate of innocence, made it proper, that he &s;hould be bound by his own con&s;ent or engagement, as well as by the authority of God. Our imperfection in this life, and the temp|tations which &s;urround us, make it needful, that we, in like manner, &s;hould be bound to the &s;ame rule, both by the authority of God, and our own engage|ments. It is in the law of God, that all our deputed authority to command others, or to bind our&s;elves is allotted to us. The requirement of moral duties by the law of God obligeth us to u&s;e all lawful means to promote the performance of them; and hence requires human laws and &s;elf-engagements, and the ob&s;ervance of them as conducive to it. Nay they are al&s;o expre&s;|ly required in his law, as his ordinances for helping and hedging us in to our duty. In making lawful

The more punctual and faithful ob|&s;ervation of God's law, notwith&s;tanding our mani|fold infirmities and temptations, and the more effec|tual promoting of his glory therein, is the END of our &s;elf-engagements, as well as of human laws of autho|rity. And by a due regard to their binding force, as above &s;tated, is this end promoted,&mdash;as hereby the ob|ligation of God's law is the more deeply impre&s;&s;ed on our minds, and we are &s;hut up to obedience to it, and deterred from tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing it&mdash;In con&s;equence of our formation of our vow, with re&s;pect to its matter, manner, and end, as pre&s;cribed by God, He doth, and nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t ratify it in all its awful &s;olemnities, requiring us by his law, to <HI>pay</HI> it as a bond of <HI>debt,</HI>&mdash;to <HI>perform</HI> and <HI>fulfill</HI> it as an engagement to duties, and an <HI>obligation</HI> which <HI>&s;tands upon</HI> or <HI>again&s;t</HI> us, Num. xxx. 5, 7, 9, 11. with Deut. xxiii. 21,&mdash;23. P&s;alm lxxvi. 11. &amp; l. 14. Eccl. v. 4, 5. Mat. v. 33.

<PB N="103" REF="103">
We pay, perform, and fulfil it <HI>as a bond,</HI> wherewith we, in obedience to Him, <HI>have bound our&s;elves,</HI> to endeavour univer&s;al obedience to his law, as our only rule of faith and manners.

We profane that authority over our&s;elves in the exerci&s;e of which we made the vow, and con&s;equentially that &s;upreme authority in God, from which ours was derived; and &s;o &s;trike a|gain&s;t the foundation of the whole law. We mani|fe&s;t a contempt of that law, which regulated the mat|ter and manner of our vow. We profane the vow, as an ordinance of God's wor&s;hip, appointed in his law. By trampling on a noted mean of promoting obedience to all the commands of God, We mark our hatred of them, and prepare our&s;elves to tran&s;gre&s;s them, and endeavour to remove the awe of God's au|thority and terror of his judgments from our con&s;cien|ces. We bla&s;phemou&s;ly repre&s;ent the Mo&s;t High as

Contrary to the truth and faithfulne&s;s required in his law, and pledged in our vow, we plunge our&s;elves into the mo&s;t criminal deceit and fal&s;ehood. Contrary to equity, we rob God and his church of that which we had &s;olemnly devoted to their &s;ervice. Contrary to devotion, we bani&s;h the &s;erious impre&s;&s;ion of God's adorable perfections. Contrary to good neighbourhood, we render our&s;elves a plague and cur&s;e, and encourage others to the mo&s;t enor|mous wickedne&s;s. Contrary to the de&s;ign of our creation and pre&s;ervation, we reject the glory of God, and obedience to his law from being our end.

<P N="2">II. The&s;e public covenants of our ance&s;tors, in which they abjured the Popi&s;h and other abominati|ons, may be called NATIONAL, becau&s;e the repre&s;en|tatives, or the greater or better part of the nation, jointly entered into them, as covenants of duty graft|ed upon the covenant of grace. But they ought never to be called <HI>national</HI> or <HI>civil,</HI> in order to exclude them from being <HI>church-covenants,</HI> and thus dimini&s;h the &s;olemnity or continuance of their obligation. Both church and &s;tate jointly promoted them, and in dif|ferent re&s;pects they related to both, being at once cove|nants of men with God, and with one another. In &s;o far as therein they covenanted with one another, with an <HI>immediate</HI> view to promote or pre&s;erve what belong|ed to the &s;tate, they &s;erved in&s;tead of a civil bond. But at the &s;ame time, they covenanted with one ano|ther as church-members, in &s;ubordination to their covenanting with God him&s;elf as their principal party.&mdash;The ratifications given to the&s;e covenants by the State were really <HI>civil ratifications,</HI> which adopted them as a part of the laws of the State.&mdash;But that no more rendered them <HI>merely civil</HI> covenants, than the civil ratifications given to, and embodying our Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith, made them <HI>merely civil con|fe&s;&s;ions,</HI> and mere acts of Parliament,&mdash;or than the repeated legal e&s;tabli&s;hment of our Prote&s;tant religion in doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline and government, made it a mere <HI>civil religion.</HI> The&s;e covenants were &s;ome|times u&s;ed as means of promoting civil purpo&s;es.

But &s;o is the chri&s;|tian religion and all the ordinances of it, if duly ob&s;er|ved, 1 Tim. i. 8. Prov. xiv. 34. I admit, that there was &s;ometimes too mixed an interference of civil and ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical power in enjoining the&s;e covenants. But abu&s;e of things doth not alter their nature.

<P>The origination of the Solemn League and Cove|nant was equally con&s;i&s;tent with a <HI>religious vow.</HI> Not a few of the mo&s;t pious clergymen in England had all along, from Elizabeth's e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Prote&s;tant religion, hated part of the ceremonies, and the lord|ly power of the bi&s;hops. Many of the&s;e, driven from their charge, by the Prelatical per&s;ecution, under Eli|zabeth and James, and Charles I had been compa&s;|&s;ionately taken into the families of great men, for the education of their children. Their in&s;truction and e|xample were remarkably ble&s;&s;ed, for rendering their pupils and others intelligent and pious. They per|ceived the encroachments made upon their religion and liberties by Abp. Laud and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and not a few of them conceived a &s;trong reli&s;h for what was then called Puritani&s;m. The &s;ucce&s;s of the Scotch covenanters, in their &s;truggles with the tyrannical court, made many of the Engli&s;h wi&s;h and hope for a &s;imilar deliverance. In their treaty with Charles 1641, the Scots reque&s;ted, that the Engli&s;h &s;hould be brought to a reformed uniformity with them&s;elves in religion. The Scotch mini&s;ters, who attended their Commi&s;&s;io|ners at London, in forming that treaty of peace, by their in&s;tructions and example, recommended their Pre&s;byterian reformation not a little to many of the mo&s;t learned and pious of the Engli&s;h. A corre&s;pon|dence for promoting a religious uniformity between the two churches was carried on by a number of the Engli&s;h clergymen with the Scotch A&s;&s;emblies, 1641, 1642, 1643; and by the Engli&s;h parliament with the A&s;&s;emblies, 1642, 1643.

You cannot but allow, that even in private civil deeds, the obligation is extended far beyond the <HI>immediate engagers.</HI> In bonds, re&s;pecting money or &s;ervice, men bind not only them&s;elves, but their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, and a&s;&s;igns, e&s;pecially, if they have the con|tinued right to, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that fund or property from which that money or &s;ervice natively ari&s;eth. The obligations contained in a call to a mini&s;ter, fix on the whole congregation, if &s;ub&s;cribed by the majority, without any regular di&s;&s;ent,&mdash;and on &s;uch as after|wards accede to it. The treaties of peace, traffick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contracted by Kings, Parliaments, Magi&s;trates, are held binding on their &s;ubjects, and even on their po&s;terity. They, who accede to any &s;ociety, fall un|der the binding force of its &s;ocial engagements for debt, duty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If bonds and covenants did only bind immediate contractors, nothing but the wilde&s;t di&s;order would en&s;ue. If the immediate engagers,

quickly after died, they who tru&s;ted to their engage|ment, might be totally ruined.&mdash;A minority, who had been &s;ilent during the tran&s;action, might, in a few days, overturn a bond or contract of the majori|ty. Subjects might, at their plea&s;ure, render void the contracts and treaties of their rulers. To pretend, that men may not u&s;e the &s;ame freedom, in binding their repre&s;entees and po&s;terity to God, as in binding them to men, is highly ab&s;urd and &s;hocking, as it repre&s;ents God as more dangerous, and le&s;s honoura|ble and u&s;eful to be dealt with, than the very wor&s;t of men. Why may not a parent, in offering his child to God in bapti&s;m, take hold of God to be his God, and the God of his &s;eed after him to all generations,&mdash;and dedicate not only that child, but all his po&s;te|rity to God, as his honoured va&s;&s;als and &s;ervants, Gen. xvii. 7. Acts ii. 39.?&mdash;Is this le&s;s dutiful, &s;afe, or honourable, than to infeft him&s;elf and them in &s;ome earthly property, and bind them as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it, to be the va&s;&s;als of &s;ome &s;inful &s;uperior?&mdash;If the majority of a &s;ociety, e&s;pecially in di&s;tre&s;s, may put the whole under the authority and protection of a man who is a great &s;inner, why mu&s;t they act either wickedly or fooli&s;hly, if, by a &s;olemn dedication, they put it under the e&s;pecial care and protection of the Great GOD our Saviour? Rev. xi. 15. P&s;al. ii. 12. &amp; xxii. 27. If the repre&s;entatives of a people, may bind them to live peaceably and trade hone&s;tly with earthly neighbours; or may, in &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;ub|ject them to the power, laws, or exactions of other earthly &s;uperiors,&mdash;why allow them no power to &s;tu|dy peace with God, and to follow peace with all men and holine&s;s?&mdash;No power to &s;urrender them to God, to be ruled by his law,&mdash;and to render him his due re|venues of honour?&mdash;Hath not God an original and &s;upreme right to all men as his creatures, &s;ubjects, and children?

<P>In covenants with men, a proper and timely di&s;&s;ent may frequently be well founded; and may effectually divert this obligation from the di&s;&s;enters. But how there could be a lawful di&s;&s;ent from an engagement carefully to keep all the commandments of God and nothing el&s;e, I know not. Had the whole, or even the body of the Hebrew nation, timely and regularly di&s;&s;ented from the treaty made by their princes with the Gibeonites, it might have diverted its obligation from them.&mdash;In&s;lead of this, they appear to have a|greed to the final &s;tating of it, without a &s;ingle mur|mur, Jo&s;h. ix. But, if the&s;e princes had, by cove|nant, devoted them&s;elves and their tribes to a careful keeping of God's commandments; I know not how the people's di&s;&s;ent could have diverted the obligation from them&s;elves.&mdash;In covenants with men, the non-fulfilment of &s;ome condition or &s;ome di&s;pen&s;ation or remi&s;&s;ion may weaken, if not perfectly annul, the ob|ligation. But none can di&s;pen&s;e with, or grant re|mi&s;&s;ions, in the matters of God.

In 1638, the privy council again took it, as it &s;tood in 1581.

<HI>of Perth,</HI> and appointed it to be &s;worn by all the members of every future Parliament. It was &s;worn by the members of Parliament 1644. In 1649, the national covenant, and the Solemn League which was materially the &s;ame, were renewed by the members of Parliament, with &s;olemn fa&s;ting and humiliation. The oath framed in 1641, to be &s;worn by members of Par|liament, at taking their &s;eats, expre&s;ly approved the national covenant. King Charles I. gave a &s;olemn approbation of it. King Charles II. and other magi&s;|trates took the covenants in 1650 and 1651.

<P N="2">(2.) In the&s;e covenants our Repre&s;entatives in the church, in their &s;tation, devoted them&s;elves and their people to the faith, profe&s;&s;ion and obedience of Chri&s;t. In April 1581, the General A&s;&s;embly unanimou&s;ly approved the <HI>national covenant,</HI> and then in October en&s;uing, in the name of Chri&s;t, appointed it to be &s;ub|&s;cribed by all Prote&s;tants. In 1588 and 1590, they made further acts for promoting this &s;ub&s;cription. The general A&s;&s;emblies of 1596, 1638, 1639, and the Commi&s;&s;ions or A&s;&s;emblies of 1643, 1644, 1648, 1649, enjoined the &s;wearing of the covenant by all a|dult church-members. I do not know of one Pre&s;by|terian mini&s;ter or ruling elder in Scotland, who, in a|ny of the covenanting periods of 1581, 1590, 1596, 1638, 1643, 1648, declined taking it. Now, if ci|vil repre&s;entatives may bind their &s;ubjects and their po&s;terity by civil contracts, Why ought not the har|monious dedication of them&s;elves and people to God, by church-rulers to have a like binding force? If, in public prayers, mini&s;ters may devote them&s;elves and congregations to Chri&s;t, why may not they and ruling elders conjunctly do it, by public covenant? But we do not chiefly re&s;t the matter on the&s;e grounds; for,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) It is beyond all contradiction, that the lawful and public covenants civil or religious, which are made by parents, do bind their po&s;terity. The oath of E&s;au, in which he re&s;igned his birthright to Jacob, bound his po&s;terity never to attempt recovering the privileges of it, from Jacob or his de&s;cendents. Hence E&s;au and his family, after the death of I&s;aac, remov|ed intirely from Canaan, Gen. xxv. 33. &amp; xxxvi. 6. Even the public cur&s;e, which the Jews took upon them&s;elves and their children, hath been manife&s;tly binding on them the&s;e &s;eventeen hundred years pa&s;t, Mat. xxvii 25. The vow of parents in the antient circumci&s;ion, or the Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m of their infants,
<PB N="127" REF="127">
extends to the&s;e children,&mdash;nay according to the ex|tent of God's covenant and promi&s;e to all their future &s;eed, Gen. xvii. 7. Acts ii. 38, 39. Hence, what|ever any of them do contrary to that vow, mu&s;t at once be perfidy and rebellion again&s;t God. Nor will their wilful or &s;lothful ignorance of that obligation, or their non-con&s;ent to it, when grown up, free them from that guilt, any more than ignorance of Adam's covenant, or of the breach of it, can free his po&s;terity from the guilt of his fir&s;t &s;in, or from perfidy in their per&s;onal violations of that covenant of works. In Deut. v. 2, 3. God, by Mo&s;es declares, that the co|venant made with the I&s;raelites at Sinai, was not made with them only, but with all that new generation of their children and grand children, who &s;urvived them, Num. xxvi. 64.&mdash;In Deut. xxix. 14, 15. he declares, that the covenant taken by that new genera|tion in the plains of Moab, did not only bind them who were alive and pre&s;ent at the entrance into it, but al&s;o others, even their po&s;terity.&mdash;Their covenant with the Gibeonites did not only bind the immediate engagers and con&s;enters, but al&s;o their po&s;terity, ma|ny ages afterward, Jo&s;h. ix. 15, 19. with 2 Sam. xxi. 1.&mdash;Now, the&s;e covenants of allegiance to God and duty to men, of which we are treating, were &s;worn and &s;ub&s;cribed by our own <HI>natural,</HI> tho' now <HI>mediate</HI> parents, and when it is con&s;idered, how FREQUENT|LY that covenant, the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance in the &s;eve|ral Bonds, was &s;worn or &s;ub&s;cribed, and how GENE|RALLY;&mdash;and how readily &s;ome covenanted on one occa&s;ion, who&s;e ance&s;tors had not on a preceding;&mdash;and how families have been &s;ince intermixed, it will &s;carce remain probable, that there is a Scotchman, at lea&s;t on the continent of Britain or Ireland, who is not de&s;cended from &s;ome covenanter. If any, to his own di&s;grace, will contend that in all the&s;e and diffe|rent periods of covenanting 1581, 1590, 1596, 1638, 1639, 1643, 1648, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all his progenitors were &s;uch mere neutrals, or malignant oppo&s;ers of the true reli|gion and liberties of the country, that none of them took the covenant, let him take heed, le&s;t, after all, God his Creditor find him a perjured tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the covenant of his fathers,&mdash;or at lea&s;t, of the cove|nant

<P N="4">(4.) That lawful covenants, made by the greater part of a &s;ociety bind the whole, and every future acceder to it,&mdash;at lea&s;t, unle&s;s the minority or acceders have, by a proper di&s;&s;ent, diverted the obligation from them&s;elves;&mdash;and that, if remarkably calculated to promote the common advantage, they bind the mem|bers of it, while it continues a &s;ociety,&mdash;Common &s;en&s;e will not allow us to doubt. That the exact ful|filment of our covenants with God, is remarkably cal|culated to promote the honour of Chri&s;t and his Fa|ther, and the welfare of both church and &s;tate, hath been formerly hinted.

Have we not produced evi|dence that multitudes of the Highlanders entered into the reformers covenant, 1638, and were not Argyle, Mar, and many other Highland chiefs zealous cove|nanters? Did not &s;uch as were otherwi&s;e minded take the covenant of 1581, as impo&s;ed by the Privy coun|cil according to its original meaning? Did not even the Doctors and Prelatic inhabitants of Aberdeen take that bond, without approving the council's limitation of it to its original meaning? (3) You can produce no evidence that the covenanting work was not carried on in the Scotch i&s;lands, but &s;uch as we have, that ne|ver a Hebrew child was circumci&s;ed on the 8th day, from I&s;aac to John Bapti&s;t;&mdash;or that never a weekly Sabbath was ob&s;erved from the creation till the manna fell around the Hebrew camp, <HI>i. e.</HI> want of po&s;itive evidence to the contrary,&mdash;and that too in places, of which, to this moment, we have little account, except what relates to their &s;ituation, &s;oil, product, or the like. (4.) It is highly ab&s;urd to pretend, that the &s;o general di&s;regard of the covenants, twelve or forty years after the la&s;t taking of them, is <HI>internal evidence</HI> that few had taken them.

Will the gene|ral concurrence of the Hebrews in wor&s;hipping the gol|den calf, prove that they had not entered into &s;olemn covenant with God, about forty days before? Will their &s;ub&s;equent apo&s;ta&s;ies, prove that but few of them had covenanted with God, under Jo&s;hua, A&s;a, Joa&s;h, Hezekiah, Jo&s;iah, Ezra and Nehemiah?

<P>OBJECT. IV. <Q REND="inline">"Force or fear cau&s;ed many to cove|nant."</Q> ANSW. Though force or &s;ear &s;hould have rendered the manner of covenanting unacceptable to God, they cannot render void an oath which is &s;worn. (2.) I will never contend, that the penalty annexed by
<PB N="151" REF="151">
law to the refu&s;al of the covenant in 1643, or even on &s;ome other occa&s;ions, was proper. But, after a labo|rious &s;earch, I find no proper evidence, that any force was ever u&s;ed in Scotland to make any take the cove|nant, except in 1639, by Montro&s;e and Monro, two military men, without any warrant from either church or &s;tate,&mdash;the former, if not both of whom afterward turned out a malignant murderer of his covenanting brethren. Never, Sir, pick up or retail the mere in|ventions of perjured violators of the&s;e covenants, who were glad to &s;ay any thing to conceal or excu&s;e their own wickedne&s;s. (3.) In 1638, when the covenanting was mo&s;t univer&s;al, the bi&s;hops and &s;ome other anti|covenanters, afraid of pro&s;ecution for their enormous debts, or for their oppre&s;&s;ive and other wicked deeds,&mdash;and perhaps chiefly to calumniate the covenanters at court, did flee their country. But none were obli|ged to do &s;o for refu&s;ing the covenant. Fear of dan|ger probably re&s;trained &s;ome from reviling a Bond which the nation &s;o highly e&s;teemed But none, that I know of, were thereby con&s;trained to &s;wear it. Some mobs happened, occa&s;ioned by the king's &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the common exerci&s;e of the civil law, and the &s;itting of its courts. But the&s;e were dete&s;ted by the zealous covenanters, and not one of them appears either to have been intended, or to have i&s;&s;ued in favours of the covenant. If the influences of God's Spirit, and the affecting appearances of his Providence&mdash;as at Sinai or in the apo&s;tolic age, awed or allured numbers to take the covenant who&s;e hearts were not &s;incere before him,&mdash;&s;hould we quarrel with the Almighty on that ac|count?&mdash;But, Sir, Hender&s;on, Dick&s;on, and Cant, who being the principal leaders of the covenanting work that year, affirm to the doctors of Aberdeen, who were eager to have detected them of fal&s;ehood, if it had been po&s;&s;ible, <Q REND="inline">"No pa&s;tors in our knowledge have been either forced to flee or have been threatened with the want of their &s;tipends for refu&s;ing their &s;ub|&s;cription; but &s;ome have of their own accord, gone to court for procuring protection again&s;t their credi|tors,&mdash;and have made lies between the king and his people.

According to this &s;cheme you may hold your ance&s;tors, who lived 130 years ago unbaptized Heathens and perhaps your&s;elf too, and &s;o renounce your bapti&s;m, becau&s;e you <HI>can|not prove</HI> that ever you received it. If God, who is our <HI>creditor</HI> in the&s;e covenants, can prove our ance&s;|tors taking of them, he will hold us bound by their deed; and even though they did not take them, he will hold us bound by the deed of the &s;ociety and its repre&s;entatives. (2.) You know, that Lord &mdash;, about four hundred years ago, granted your ance&s;tor, the valuable e&s;tate of &mdash;, to be held under him and his heirs, for a very &s;mall honorary &s;ervice, as an ac|knowledgment of va&s;&s;alage; and that the celebrated farmer <HI>A.

Have you certified the pre&s;ent heirs of that Lord and Farmer, That they are no-wi&s;e bound by their proge|nitors deeds, unle&s;s they have given their own per&s;onal con&s;ent,&mdash;and that the one may recal your e&s;tate, and the other may keep your farm, and refu&s;e to pay you any rent?&mdash;You have not, nor ever will You al|low &s;uch freedoms only to be u&s;ed with God,&mdash;not with your&s;elf;&mdash;too &s;trong a pre&s;umption, That you more value your e&s;tate and rent, than all that you hold of God in religion, and all the honour you owe to him. (3.) If our fathers bound us to any thing in religion which is not warranted by the word of God, we have nothing to do with it, but to bewail their &s;in in &s;uch engagement. But, if they bound us to what is commanded by the law of God, we mu&s;t &s;tand bound,&mdash;till we prove from &s;cripture, that vows binding to duty are not lawful; or that fathers have no right to devote their children to God's &s;ervice.

Now, Sir, do you &s;o heartily envy our Redeemer his Father's grant of the ends of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, P&s;al. ii. 8. that you would gladly renounce our ance&s;tors &s;olemn ac|quie&s;cence in it? Do do you &s;o heartily di&s;like the hav|ing of a reconciled God in Chri&s;t for your and your po&s;terity's God, Saviour and portion, and his pure o|racles and ordinances for your privileges, that you would fondly renounce a &s;olemn acceptance of God's gracious grant of them &s;ealed and con&s;irmed by the re|markable influences of his Spirit?

Moreover, it is &s;carce credible, that you can love every thing engaged to in a vow, and yet hate to be bound by it, after God hath &s;ignally countenanced it.
