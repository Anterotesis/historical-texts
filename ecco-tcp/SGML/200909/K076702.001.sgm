<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WITH a con&s;iderable degree of anxiety the author at length delivers to the public candour the greate&s;t labour of his life.</P>
<P>The plan of this work being in &s;ome re&s;pects new, it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to indicate the cau&s;es of the arrangement. The characters of the monarchs are delineated at the commencement, not at the clo&s;e, of their reigns; becau&s;e in the mo&s;t eminent hi&s;torical productions, when other per&s;onages a&s;cend the &s;cene, they are thus introduced, and recommended to the reader's attention, as he becomes more intere&s;ted in the events by a previous acquaintance with the actors. In the other mode the mind &s;eems to feel &s;ome defect in gratification, &s;ome de&s;ire to reperu&s;e the reign, in order to mark its corre&s;pondence with the character: nor can any ju&s;t cau&s;e be a&s;&s;igned why the princes &s;hould, in this re&s;pect, be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other chief per&s;onages. Nor is the private per&s;onal character of a monarch always to be di&s;cerned in the
<PB N="vi" REF="5">public fortunes of his &s;overeignty, often the machina|tions of mini&s;ters and parties, though it doubtle&s;s have &s;uch influence as to de&s;erve great attention: and modern hi&s;tory not permitting &s;uch variety of rhetoric and digre&s;&s;ion, as the ancient cla&s;&s;ical models afford, it becomes the more important to pre&s;erve its legal wealth unviolated, and to diver&s;ify the chronicle of wars and treaties by ethic portraiture, by delineations of men and manners. Yet in this arrangement of the characters it becomes indi&s;pen&s;able, that the reign be fir&s;t compo&s;ed with complete candour, from the mo&s;t genuine and unbia&s;&s;ed &s;ources, and meditated in all its relations of time, place, and circum&s;tances, before a ju&s;t e&s;timate can be prefixed.</P>
<P>Another novelty is the Retro&s;pect, interpo&s;ed at appropriated epochs, of the &s;tate of the country in civilization, government, laws, tactics, agriculture, commerce, literature, and the arts, during a preceding period. The cla&s;&s;ical page of hi&s;tory, from the age of Herodotus to the late&s;t voice of expiring Rome, is illuminated with &s;uch re&s;earches, though commonly pre&s;ented in the form of digre&s;&s;ions; but they are certainly de&s;erving of a &s;eparate and peculiar nich in the temple of memory. At the &s;ame time it would be ra&s;h too far to depart from the models venerated
<PB N="vii" REF="6">by the wi&s;dom of ages; or to forget that the pre&s;er|vation of national events is the allotted province of hi&s;tory. The&s;e &s;ketches mu&s;t therefore be kept in due &s;ub&s;ervience to the main de&s;ign, lea&s;t by an in|judicious exuberance of extraneous matter the very nature and name of hi&s;tory peri&s;h; and the grande&s;t records of human in&s;truction, the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pages of general entertainment, become cumbrous volumes of reference, chained to the groaning &s;helves of libra|ries. Sufficiently difficult, if performed with a due &s;en&s;e of its importance, is the ta&s;k of the hi&s;torian; and he needs little to encroach on other departments of &s;cience, upon which for him to dilate would be as ab&s;urd as if he were to give the natural hi&s;tory of the animals, and plants, of a kingdom. But when re|&s;tricted within proper bounds, and in &s;ome imitation of cla&s;&s;ical practice, the&s;e &s;ketches may be regarded as not only among the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and intere&s;ting parts of hi&s;tory, but as an agreeable variety and re|lief from the le&s;s diver&s;ified &s;eries of modern events. The author was happy to find that his ideas on this topic completely corre&s;ponded with tho&s;e of the late Mr. Gibbon, who was plea&s;ed warmly to expre&s;s his ap|probation of this part of the plan, of its arrangement, and of the &s;pace allotted to it, as calculated, not to
<PB N="viii" REF="7">encumber and oppre&s;s the genuine province of hi&s;tory, but to variegate, enliven, and adorn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e remarks may, at the &s;ame time, an&s;wer the que&s;tion, why Dr. Henry's plan was not followed: and as little would the author, though he warmly venerate the mutual benefits of the union, be di&s;po&s;ed to imitate his example, in &s;inking the hi&s;tory of an independent, and mo&s;t memorable, king|dom, in that of a great neighbouring &s;tate; an injudicious mixture, productive of perplexity and confu&s;ion, while clear ideas can only be attained by &s;eparate and di&s;tinct views of their hi&s;tory and antiquities.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the important and intere&s;ting divi&s;ion of Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory, now before the reader, no pioneer had ari&s;en to clear the way; and the author &s;oon found that the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and inaccuracy, with which it had been treated, exceeded any previous expectation he could have formed. Scarce a &s;tep could be advanced, with|out &s;ome doubt ari&s;ing in fact, or in chronology, &s;o that the information of a paragraph is often the labour of a di&s;&s;ertation. The mo&s;t &s;killful will be the fir&s;t to pardon any mi&s;takes that may remain; and the candour of all is reque&s;ted for an attempt derived from &s;o many new &s;ources, &s;o many manu&s;cript mate|rials, that after every care, and attention, not a few errors may have e&s;caped notice.</P>
<P>Had the author's abilities been equal to his ambition, it was his object and wi&s;h, to have rendered the work
<PB N="ix" REF="8">&s;o complete a model of modern hi&s;tory, &s;o per&s;picuous, intere&s;ting, various, animated, and elegant, as to merit general approbation, as to appear on the toilette as well as in the library: while at the &s;ame time, the events, chronology, references, and appendixes, &s;hould pre&s;ent an exactne&s;s impenetrable by the &s;harpe&s;t &s;pear of the &s;terne&s;t antiquary. Vain hopes! His le&s;s &s;an|guine expectations may yet claim the humble merits of patience and labour, the nur&s;es not the parents of genius&mdash;may de&s;cend from the impervious mountains of ability into the vale of accuracy. Yet even accuracy is not the meane&s;t merit of the hi&s;torian, though to attain it &s;omewhat too much may perhaps be found to be here &s;acrificed, in minute notes from diplomatic re&s;ources: but in excu&s;e the reader will remember that this par|ticular divi&s;ion of the Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory had never before been attempted by any writer ver&s;ed in common au|thentication, while Sir David Dalrymple, Dr. Robert&s;on, and other learned and able authors, have minutely il|lu&s;trated the preceding and &s;ucceeding periods. Such notes are not indeed intere&s;ting to the general reader, but they occupy little &s;pace&mdash;and the learned will not blame even a &s;uper&s;titious regard to accuracy and il|lu&s;tration, where much confu&s;ion and ob&s;curity had before prevailed: nor can the author be ju&s;tly cen&s;ured for the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of being his own pioneer, of
<PB N="x" REF="9">proceeding as in an American fore&s;t, with mo&s;t cautious &s;teps through the &s;wamps, and earne&s;tly clearing his way amid the brambles and thickets of perplexity and error.</P>
<P>Not to mention the innumerable new materials u&s;ed in the various reigns, that of James V, in particular, is almo&s;t wholly compo&s;ed from the original letters of the chief actors; and is perhaps the fir&s;t attempt of the kind in any language, a few references to &s;uch docu|ments having hitherto &s;atisfied the ambition of truth and accuracy. On a compari&s;on with preceding ac|counts, the reader will judge how much the modern hi&s;tory of all &s;tates might be verified, and improved, by &s;uch a plan; and how many gro&s;s errors remain in the mo&s;t celebrated pages of hi&s;tory. The ta&s;k is in|deed laborious, but what is temporary labour when compared with eternal truth?</P>
<P>It is a trite remark that an hi&s;torian &s;hould belong to no &s;ect, and no party: with whatever &s;everity and mode&s;ty he may e&s;timate his efforts, &s;till his labours, however humble, mu&s;t in their very nature appeal to po&s;terity; and to pollute his pages with the faction of the day, would be to violate his own dignity, and re|ject his be&s;t reward. This work, begun long before
<PB N="xi" REF="10">that change which produced the pre&s;ent opinions and commotions in Europe, was completed in a &s;ilent in|attention to them; and every &s;entiment would have been the &s;ame, if the publication had taken place ten years ago.</P>
<P>Amid times of &s;ingular difficulty, amid objects of far &s;uperior importance, &s;hould the&s;e volumes be re|ceived with favour, it would be the author's ambition to complete his de&s;ign, by compo&s;ing on the &s;ame plan the Hi&s;tory of Scotland, from the earlie&s;t accounts to the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Stuart. In twenty-four books, comprized in two &s;imilar volumes, for the do|cuments being more rare the divi&s;ions would be more brief, he would arrange the materials contained in his Enquiry into the early part, and the &s;ucceeding Annals of Lord Hailes, with numerous important additions and illu&s;trations. The materials for this part are nearly complete; and it would give the author great &s;atisfac|tion to be encouraged in pre&s;enting at length an au|thentic and legitimate hi&s;tory of his country, di&s;en|cumbered from tho&s;e clouds of fable and error, which have &s;o long expo&s;ed it to neglect or contempt.</P>
<P>From the reign of Mary to the union of the crowns, and of the kingdoms, &s;o much has been done, that
<PB N="xii" REF="11">little it would &s;eem remains for future labour. Yet the untouched manu&s;cript materials might occupy two or three years in the peru&s;al; and perhaps not a few di&s;|coveries might be made by indefatigable a&s;&s;iduity. The be&s;t form of &s;uch a work might be, one decade of hi&s;tory to the union of the crowns, and one of annals to that of the kingdoms: any &s;ucceeding events might appear in a chronological ab&s;tract, at &s;ufficient length to accompany the general hi&s;tory of a kingdom.</P>
<P>It only remains to admoni&s;h the reader, before he proceed to the peru&s;al of this work, that the letter O, prefixed to a reference, implies that the paper is the Original, either written or &s;igned, &s;ealed or dictated, by the party; and that C is the mark of a Copy, generally contemporary, always ancient.</P>

<P>THE acce&s;&s;ion of the family of Stuart to the Scoti&s;h throne de&s;erves the particular attention of the hi&s;torian. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1371</NOTE> Among the many families, which have held the regal &s;ceptre in the various kingdoms of Europe, none have been hailed with equal applau&s;e, none have encountered equal animo&s;ity. This hou&s;e being at the head of affairs, when many violent efferve&s;cences of party aro&s;e, the &s;ober voice of candour has been drowned
<PB N="2" REF="17">in the tumult of numerous parti&s;ans. Truth has &s;ighed when &s;he beheld all the weeds of obloquy, and all the flowers of prai&s;e, heaped upon the &s;ame monument.</P>
<P>But the period is at length arrived, when the violence both of religious, and of political, party was to &s;uffer a con&s;iderable abatement. When univer&s;al right of con&s;cience &s;hall order governments to refrain from the private bu&s;ine&s;s of the bo&s;om; and &s;hall render even the name of toleration ridiculous by tearing down the veil, which ob&s;cured the mo&s;t &s;acred prerogatives of mankind. When the intere&s;ted aims of antiquated parties were to become objects of equal neglect to enlightened nations, who began to &s;ee that one party alone could &s;erve them, an union of the people again&s;t their corrupters and oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>There is a gloomy bigotry in the &s;pirit of party which is inimical to rea&s;on, and which clouds the &s;un&s;hine of the mind. Ab&s;urdity becomes as contagious as a pe&s;tilence; and many tenets are objects of belief becau&s;e they are impracticable to argument. Hence we cea&s;e to wonder when we behold the human character, &s;o variable in it&s;elf, and &s;o liable to every alteration of time and circum&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;ed to be con&s;tant and immutable in one family only. To the jaundiced eye of party the whole Hou&s;e of Stuart became, as it were, one te&s;t of political and religious opinion. In&s;tead of granting, according to the dictates of rea&s;on and of fact, that the monarchs of that illu&s;trious family were as various in their characters, and conduct, as tho&s;e of any other genealogy, and country, faction has been &s;o ab&s;urd as to form them into one hou&s;e of fame, or di&s;prai&s;e. One character alone may indeed be a&s;cribed to the whole fa|mily, in the &s;acred term of unfortunate: and their proverbial misfortunes as often contradict the political maxim, that want of &s;ucce&s;s is but another expre&s;&s;ion for defect of prudence, as they confirm the rigorous ob&s;ervation. If one other general
<PB N="3" REF="18">remark be allowed, it mu&s;t be, that mo&s;t of the princes of this family were better qualified for the enjoyments and elegancies of private life, than for the toil and dazzling bu&s;tle of royalty; and had little of that tyrannic &s;plendor which plea&s;es the people &s;o much, becau&s;e they regard the monarch as the public repre|&s;entative, and exult when he &s;hews his &s;pirit by trampling upon them. A mild &s;overeign may receive the appellation of a tyrant, from his yielding &s;ome prerogatives, and thus rai&s;ing hope and re&s;entment becau&s;e he concedes not more; while, with equal inju&s;tice, a de&s;pot may &s;ecure popular applau&s;e, becau&s;e his royal &s;pirit pre&s;erves the tyranny in pure and un|corrupted pomp. To confirm this ob&s;ervation let the hou&s;es of Tudor and of Stuart be compared. But after the&s;e prepa|ratory remarks, it is now proper to return to the immediate cour&s;e of the narration.</P>
<P>The &s;ceptre of Scotland pa&s;&s;ed to the family of Stuart at an unfortunate period for the acceding progeny. In&s;tead of a new &s;overeign who might intere&s;t the wi&s;hes of the nation, by the amiable and &s;plendid promi&s;es of youth, or excite its con|fidence and ambition by the &s;teady &s;pirit of middle age, the reins of government fell into a hand trembling under the weight of years.</P>
<P>In order to enable the reader to form ju&s;t ideas concerning this important event, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to explain, as briefly as po&s;&s;ible, the origin, and progre&s;s, of the family of Stuart; and its actual condition when it a&s;cended the Scoti&s;h throne.</P>
<P>The fables of adulation have now pa&s;&s;ed away, and it is acknowledged that we have no certain evidence concerning this family, till the reign of David I, when Walter the &s;on of Alan appears as Steward <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dapifer,</HI> a term &s;ynonymous with <HI>Sene&s;chalcus,</HI> in France as in Scotland: Du Cange voce Sene&s;chalcus.

The office is evident; it was not only the chief of the hou&s;hold, but its power, from the confidence acquired by that &s;tation, extended to the collection and management of the re|venue; to the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; and even to the chief direction in war.

But the power was in France found too va&s;t for a &s;ubject; and in 1191 the dignity and emoluments began to be re&s;erved to the crown. The office was gradually &s;ubdivided into tho&s;e of Great Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;hold, Con&s;table or commander in chief, and High Ju&s;ticiary.

No action worthy of the hi&s;toric page is authentically recorded of the&s;e three: and the mo&s;t important intelligence, which we can obtain from their charters, is the &s;ituation of their lands; which were chiefly in that we&s;tern promontory, wa&s;hed by the fertile and picture&s;que river Clyde, and now called the &s;hire of Renfrew, then, and &s;ince, the territory of the family, and power, of the Stewards <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Crawford's Hi&s;tory of the &s;hire of Renfrew, and of the Hou&s;e of Stuart, Edin. 1710, folio, Pai&s;ley 1782, 4to.

Di&s;tingui&s;hed in early youth by his conduct at the battle of Halidon, by his deci&s;ive exertions again&s;t Edward Baliol; by the &s;ingular prai&s;e of being appointed, in conjunction with Murray, governor of Scotland, at the age of eighteen, he did not afterwards fru&s;trate the general expectation <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Crawf. 26.

<P>The actual &s;tate of the family, when it became royal, claims our next attention. Rewards for &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ervices of import|ance, and the dower of the princely bride, had encrea&s;ed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Stuarts to a great number, and extent, in various regions, both in the we&s;tern and ea&s;tern parts of Scot|land <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Crawf. pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>. Had the territories of Douglas been as detached as tho&s;e of Stuart, that name had never become formidable to the crown: but chance, and not de&s;ign, &s;eems to have pre&s;ided in this di&s;tant allotment. The title, and office, of High Steward had &s;ucceeded, in France, to the &s;upremacy of the Mairs of the Palace: and in that, and other, countries were &s;oon found too lofty for the ambition of a &s;ubject: hence it is not matter of &s;urprize that no territorial dignity was annexed to this dis|tinction, till the year 1359, when the earldom of Strathern devolving into the hands of David II, was by him conferred on Robert, afterwards his &s;ucce&s;&s;or <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Crawf. 26.

The &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the &s;ceptre was al&s;o for|tified by a numerous progeny, ready to a&s;&s;ert and to perpetuate his claim. By his fir&s;t wife, Elizabeth daughter of Sir Adam More of Rowallan, he had his &s;ucce&s;&s;or John lord of Kyle, created Earl of Carric by David II; Walter earl of Fife; Robert, by marrying an heire&s;s of his own family, Earl of Menteith, afterwards Earl of Fife likewi&s;e, and Duke of Albany; and Alexander of Badenoch Earl of Buchan: be&s;ides &s;ix daughters, united to the powerful families of March, Lyon of Glamis <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">In the &s;econd year of this reign the <HI>Thanage</HI> of Glamis was granted to John Lyon; the <HI>relevium</HI> 10<HI>l.</HI> Scot&s;tarvet's Calendars, Harl. 4609, f. 109.</NOTE>, Hay of Errol, Mac Donald of Ilay and the I&s;les, Douglas of Nith&s;dale, Lind&s;ay of Glene&s;k.

<P>The King was advanced to his fifty fifth year <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">He was born on the 2d of March 1316. Dalr.

The rebellious &s;teed belonged to Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith, "Johannes Comes de Carrik, ex percu&s;&s;ione equi Domini Jacobi Douglas de Dalkeith, qua&s;i claudus effectus."</NOTE>, and was lame and weak in body, and of no power of intellect. A per&s;onal de|formity, which often arou&s;es &s;uperior &s;pirit in an individual, is pernicious to princes, in whom not a defect, but a &s;uperiority, of dignity is matter of a general expectation, &s;o deeply rooted in our nature, that &s;avage nations often appoint their &s;overeigns only from &s;uperior per&s;onal appearance.

<P>The per&s;on of Robert II was however large and maje&s;tic <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Fordun, II, 383.</NOTE>. The qualities of his mind it is difficult to mark with preci&s;ion. The di&s;ea&s;e of his eyes &s;eems to have induced a de&s;ire of pri|vacy, and age a propen&s;ity to indolence, and the indolent are always ruled by tho&s;e around them. War he &s;hunned, and declined the laborious office of a general; but the leaders whom he appointed were well cho&s;en and &s;ucce&s;sful. In the more difficult and more truly glorious arts of peace, he is intitled to con&s;iderable prai&s;e. The terrors of ju&s;tice he knew how to deal impartially to the guilty, while he opened every gate of protection to the innocent. His actions proceeded in a &s;olid and rational tenor; and his promi&s;e was the exact &s;tandard of his performance. Internal di&s;cords his equity appea&s;ed; and though his own age, and the infirmity of the apparent heir, rendered his reign feeble, yet his wi&s;dom prevented it from being unfortunate. In a word he is little known to hi&s;tory, becau&s;e he was a good king, and a good man.</P>
<P>Upon the death of David II the &s;tates of the kingdom a&s;|&s;embled at Lithgow; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb.</NOTE> and their determination appeared una|nimous in the appointment of Robert as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the vacant throne <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Fordun, II, 382.</NOTE>. But a &s;udden cloud aro&s;e, which threatened all the &s;torms of civil war. William Earl of Douglas unexpectedly claimed the crown, as uniting in him&s;elf the dubious preten|&s;ions of Comyn, and the &s;olid title of Baliol. Yet the claim was no &s;ooner made than withdrawn. Our elder hi&s;torians a&s;&s;ert that the &s;trong intere&s;ts of the Earls of Dunbar and
<PB N="10" REF="25">Murray, and the yet &s;tronger of Sir Robert Er&s;kine, keeper of the ca&s;tles of Dunbarton, Edinburgh, and Stirling, appearing decided for the Steward; induced Douglas to re&s;ign his ex|pectation; while the hi&s;torian of the hou&s;e of Douglas a&s;cribes the de&s;ertion of the claim to its own friends <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Fordun, II, 382. Winton MS. 818. Hume's hou&s;e of Douglas, I, 160&mdash;163.</NOTE>. Preten&s;ions, which now &s;trike as vague or u&s;urpative, might not wear that appearance in an age when the rights of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion were fluctuating and undetermined. But prudence certainly did not con&s;pire with ambition upon this occa&s;ion, for no previous concert appears, no conciliation of intere&s;t; and the claim can only be recommended as a &s;ubject of &s;peculation. Had Robert I united his hou&s;e to that of Douglas, the pro&s;perity of Scotland might perhaps have been more ample under a family that, though &s;ubject, &s;hewed a regal &s;pirit; that in war boa&s;ts a genealogy of heroes; and that happened to have few of tho&s;e minorities, which harra&s;&s;ed the kingdom under the Stuarts: but in the more u&s;eful honours of peace the latter family &s;eem to have been far &s;uperior, and by their merit alone better de|&s;erved the &s;ceptre.</P>

<P>In the &s;ame Regi&s;ter, fol. 68, are pre&s;erved the &s;ecret articles, dated 30 June.

France is al&s;o to &s;end at her expence 1000 men at arms to Scotland, and to continue the &s;ub&s;idy as the war may demand: the payment to commence at Bruges, half a year after the rupture of the alliance with England.

<P><PB N="12" REF="27">Another clau&s;e in the &s;ame treaty had effects apparently not fore&s;een, and certainly not wi&s;hed nor intended.

According to the old Engli&s;h and Scoti&s;h writers, this breach of the truce aro&s;e from the ra&s;hne&s;s of a few borderers <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;. 222, 223. Ypod. 136. Otterbourn, 148.

This la&s;t account we are di&s;po&s;ed to follow; and to infer, from the narrative of it's author, that the coun&s;els of France, which aimed to divert the attention of Richard II from the ambitious views of his grandfather, had a &s;hare in &s;timulating the Scots, already &s;tung with repeated in&s;ults, to regard the dubious truce in the &s;ame light with the Engli&s;h, and to break it when it &s;uited their convenience <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Mezeray, Abr.

The French hi&s;torian infroms us, that, by direction of Robert II, and his council, a &s;mall army was ordered to meet on the borders under the command of Douglas, Murray and Mar. While this ho&s;t was gradually a&s;&s;embling, and e&s;quire, named Alexander Ram&s;ay, proceeded with forty companions to Ber|wick. Sending a &s;py to di&s;cover the &s;tate of the ca&s;tle, it was found that there was no water in the ditches, and no guard on the walls. Ram&s;ay and his followers immediately planted ladders, &s;caled the walls, and came to the keep, where the
<PB N="18" REF="33">commander was in bed, it being apparently early in the day, and he was killed in attempting to e&s;cape. An alarm being given the governor of the town ordered the &s;top and pillars of the drawbridge to be de&s;troyed; and upon the a&s;&s;ailants finding that they could not pa&s;s, the governor and his people &s;houted "Are you there?

<P>Meanwhile the Earl of Northumberland &s;ummoned his array to Berwick; and with ten thou&s;and men be&s;ieged the ca&s;tle, and began a mine.

<P>The Earl of Nottingham joined Northumberland, and they re&s;olved to fight the Scoti&s;h army if it advanced again&s;t them, or, if not, to ravage the &s;outhern parts of Scotland. A party of three hundred lances and as many archers was detached, under Mu&s;grave the governor of Berwick, to Melro&s;e, while the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h army advanced to a hamlet near Rox|burgh where the Scots lay. Mu&s;grave &s;ent two &s;quires to explore the enemy, who were taken, and di&s;covered the Engli&s;h &s;ituation and de&s;igns; upon which the Scots re&s;olved to &s;urprize Mu&s;grave, and marching immediately arrived near Melro&s;e at midnight; but a tempe&s;t of wind and rain blowing in their faces, they could hardly with&s;tand it's force, and wan|dered

Halting under a wood, and making fires, they remained till dawn, when the tempe&s;t abated: and, as they were forced to forage, they had &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes with Mu&s;grave's men who were alike employed; and he determined to advance to the right, in order to join the Engli&s;h army, but the Scots amounting to &s;even hundred lances, and two thou|&s;and uncouthly armed, lay in the wood, and intercepted his progre&s;s. A conflict being unavoidable Douglas, according to the cu&s;tom of the times, knighted James his &s;on, and Robert and David, two &s;ons of the king: the battle was quickly de|cided; Archibald Douglas, lighting on foot, and wielding a &s;word of enormous length which another man could hardly have held, made great &s;laughter: Mu&s;grave, his &s;on, and many knights, and &s;quires were taken. The Scoti&s;h army retired towards Edinburgh with their captives, while Northumberland and Nottingham could not pur&s;ue them, becau&s;e of the tem|pe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on of the year, and were forced to return, and di&s;mi&s;s their men, while the Scots were rejoicing and ran&s;om|ing their captives at large &s;ums <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, ib.</NOTE>.

<P>But an event of which there had been no example in Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory, and which fortunately was not repeated till the six|teenth century, is to arre&s;t attention by its novelty, and im|portance.</P>
<P>The government of France determined if po&s;&s;ible to deliver that country from the repeated inva&s;ions of the Engli&s;h, by carrying the war into England from its northern limits, in conjunction with the Scots, and in compliance with the terms of the late treaty. Jehan de Vienne, Admiral of France, a leader of the fir&s;t talents and di&s;tinction, accordingly failed from Sluys in Flanders with a thou&s;and men at arms, <NOTE PLACE="marg">May</NOTE> knights and e&s;quires, twelve hundred complete &s;uits of armour for Scoti&s;h gentlemen, and a large &s;um of money <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, II, fol. 164, 166.

Yet her declared intentions, and the vigour and importance of her plans, rai&s;ed &s;uch an alarm in England, that all her power and re&s;ources were excited to repell the attack: and the failure of the &s;outhern inva&s;ion collected the whole tempe&s;t upon Scotland, and &s;hook that kingdom to the center. Vienne arrived at Leith with his cho&s;en battalion, which, to u&s;e the phra&s;e of Froi&s;&s;art, formed one flower of chivalry; and they were quartered in the villages around Edinburgh, till the King, then in the country, &s;hould arrive at that capital. The French hi&s;torian upon this occa&s;ion pre&s;ents a deplorable picture of the &s;tate of Scotland and its people. The poverty of the country, and the barbari&s;m of the nation, appear to have been extreme: the &s;lighte&s;t accommodations of life, or even of war, could hardly be procured: every article of iron, or of leather, was imported from Flanders. The French at fir&s;t laughed, and &s;aid that they were happy to know by experience the hard&s;hips of penury, and the dark &s;ide of a military life; but, as their di&s;content increa&s;ed, Vienne could &s;carcely appea&s;e their murmurs. On the other hand the Scots were not le&s;s di&s;&s;atisfied with their gue&s;ts; they defamed and hated their auxiliaries, as &s;trangers of an unknown &s;peech, as the future &s;harers of their prey, and as the pre&s;ent con&s;umers of their little property <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;.

The youthful monarch cho&s;e this as his fir&s;t expedition, and &s;olemn entry into the field of military fame; and was attended by his uncles, and by the chief nobles of England. The de&s;truction of the abbey of Melro&s;e, long re&s;pected by the religious awe of the Engli&s;h, to whom it had afforded early &s;aints and teachers, was the fir&s;t warlike act of Richard II, the di&s;grace of his arms and the omen of his mental weakne&s;s. Dryburgh, and newbottel, two venerable mona&s;teries, and Edinburgh with her churches, were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively given to the flames. The Scots, unable openly to contend with an enemy &s;o &s;uperior in numbers, prudently followed the advice a&s;cribed to Robert the Great, by withdrawing their cattle and effects into fore&s;ts, and wilds; and harra&s;&s;ing their foes by uncea&s;ing ambu&s;cades and excur&s;ions. The green crops were alone left; and the harve&s;t was trampled and de&s;troyed.

<P>The Northumbrians, having learned that a Scoti&s;h army was collecting, re&s;olved to prepare; and, if the Scots entered England by the we&s;tern, to repay the inva&s;ion by the ea&s;tern marches. An Engli&s;h gentleman went to e&s;py the intentions of the enemy, who had advanced to the chapel of Salom, a noted &s;tation near the borders: and entering the chapel in the di&s;gui&s;e of a &s;ervant &s;aw the Scoti&s;h nobles a&s;&s;embled, and heard much of their de&s;igns. When he withdrew he expected to have found his hor&s;e tied to a tree, as he had left him, but he was &s;tolen; and the gentleman's fear, or negligence of art, in walking away without any enquiry, led to &s;u&s;picion. He was &s;eized, and confe&s;&s;ed that the Northumbrians, unable to encounter the inimical numbers, had determined on whatever &s;ide England was invaded, to a&s;&s;ail Scotland on the oppo&s;ite. This induced the Scoti&s;h leaders to re&s;train the main army to the protection of their own country, and to order only a &s;trong detachment, under the tried heroi&s;m of the Earl of Douglas, to advance into England. At the head of three hundred men
<PB N="37" REF="52">at arms, and of two thou&s;and cho&s;en infantry, Douglas pro|ceeded, without pillaging the country or attacking any place; pa&s;&s;ed the Tine three miles above Newca&s;tle; and, with the &s;uddenne&s;s and de&s;truction of lightning, darted on the county of Durham. When the di&s;tant flames, and &s;moke, of burning villages had given the fir&s;t tidings of the Scoti&s;h arrival, the Earl of Northumberland, then at Alnwick, &s;ent his two &s;ons, Henry and Ralph, to Newca&s;tle, to a&s;&s;emble a force in pur&s;uit of the enemy, while he &s;hould gather another on the north, and preclude their retreat. All the country being pillaged to the gates of York <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">This is confe&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h monarch him&s;elf, in a deed publi&s;hed by Rymer, VII, 594.</NOTE>, and the unfortified towns and villages de&s;troyed, Douglas returned with the &s;poil, repa&s;&s;ed the Tine at the &s;ame place; and came before newca&s;tle, whither the cheif people of the neighbouring counties had crouded, to gain the protection of a walled city, and of the two gallant Percies, Henry &s;urnamed Hot&s;pur, and Ralph, his brother in birth and arms. Many &s;kirmi&s;hes en&s;uing, at one of them Douglas won the pennon of Henry Percy, to the great mortification of that undaunted leader and of his followers: and to add to the di&s;|grace Douglas vaounted, "This I &s;hall carry as a &s;ign of thy prowe&s;s to Scotland, and &s;hall place it on the pinnacle of my ca&s;tle to be known by all." Percy retorted with an oath, "Thou &s;halt never bear it out of northumberland; and in the end &s;halt have little cau&s;e to boa&s;t:" to which Douglas replied, "Then thou mu&s;t come this night, and take it from before my tent." Next morning the Scots pur&s;ued their march; and, a&s;&s;ailing a ca&s;tle without &s;ucce&s;s, wi&s;hed to proceed, but Douglas commanded them to encamp, in order to &s;ee if Percy would advance to recover his pennon, and that, being refre&s;hed,
<PB N="38" REF="53">they &s;hould again attack the fortre&s;s in the morning. They accordingly fortified their &s;tation with felled trees, to prevent a &s;urprize; and next day captured the ca&s;tle, and pur&s;ued their journey towards the main army, till they came to Otterburn, a hamlet amid the wilds of the pari&s;h of El&s;don, about thirty miles northwe&s;t of Newca&s;tle, and about twenty from the Scoti&s;h borders, which was to be a &s;cene of celebrity to the bard and to the hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Percy wi&s;hed to pur&s;ue the Scoti&s;h detachment, but was re&s;trained by the tidings that the main army was near, and ready to &s;upport Douglas; till the couriers brought certain intelligence that they were far di&s;tant, and incapable of effecting a junction for &s;ome days. Percy, with his u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity, in&s;tantly cried, "To hor&s;e!" it being early in the morning; and left Newca&s;tle attended by &s;ix hundred lances, or knights and &s;quires, and eight thou&s;and infantry accoutred with the dreadful long-bows of England. After a forced march, they reached the Scoti&s;h camp at Otterburn late in the evening. The Scots had &s;upped, &s;ome had even retired to re&s;t fatigued with various exertion; and the Engli&s;h began to enter the outer entrenchment, where the &s;ervants were &s;tationed, &s;houting "Percy! Percy!" but they found it well fortified. Some infantry was ordered to &s;upport the &s;ervants, by the Scoti&s;h chiefs, who in the mean time armed in ha&s;te, and arrayed their men under their banners. Night was now advanced; but the moon &s;hone clear in a &s;erene &s;ky of the month of Augu&s;t. <NOTE PLACE="marg">19 Aug.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Scots, armed, and arranged, proceeded, not towards the a&s;&s;ailants, but around an eminence; and attacking the enemy in the rear rai&s;ed all at once the cry of battle, upon which the Engli&s;h in &s;urprize turned, &s;trengthened their ranks, and re|founded "Percy!" in an&s;wer to the Scoti&s;h acclaim of "Douglas." After a &s;evere conte&s;t the Scots were on the
<PB N="39" REF="54">point of yielding to numbers, when the Earl of Douglas, ardently pu&s;hed forward his banner; and both the Percies advanced again&s;t him, with equal impetuo&s;ity, &s;o that the Scots recoiled, and, had not the valour of the two Hepburns oppo&s;ed, the banner of Douglas had been taken. Douglas, irritated by the apprehen&s;ion of di&s;grace, rouzed all his &s;trength and courage; and, brandi&s;hing a two-handed battle-ax, opened the thick files of the foe, as with a long avenue, de&s;pi&s;ing numerous blows, and committing his life to the temper of his armour. He had advanced far from his battalions, when he fell under three mortal wounds. But ignorance of his fate forbad the Engli&s;h to triumph, and the Scots to de&s;pair. The former only &s;aw that &s;ome valiant man at arms had fallen: and the latter were in&s;pirited by the Earls of March and Moray to follow a tract, which they knew not had conducted their leader to death. Fortune now began to favour the Scots. Ralph Percy, advancing too far in return, was &s;everly wounded, and taken pri&s;oner by Maxwell, a knight who followed Moray: and the Engli&s;h, exhau&s;ted with a fatiguing march and an ob&s;tinate conte&s;t, bagan to exhibit &s;ymptoms of depre&s;&s;ion and defeat.</P>
<P>Douglas, faint with the lo&s;s of blood, and &s;en&s;ible of the approaches of death, was defended by his valiant chaplain, William of Northberwick. His banner lay on the ground, not far from him, the bearer being &s;lain, when Lind&s;ay, Sinclair, and &s;ome other knights, pierced through the now yielding foe, and reached the &s;pot, and be&s;poke their general. Even trifles in &s;uch a conver&s;ation are intere&s;ting. "Cou&s;in, how goes it?" &s;aid Sinclair. Douglas an&s;wered "But &s;o, &s;o. Prai&s;ed be God few of my ance&s;tors have died in chambers or beds&mdash;Avenge me, for I die&mdash;My heart faints too repeatedly. Rai&s;e again my banner, and &s;hout Douglas! But tell neither
<PB N="40" REF="55">friend nor foe how it fares with me, for my enemies would exult, and my friends be di&s;con&s;olate." The banner was erected; the whole field re&s;ound with the animating cry of Douglas! and the Scots, excited as with the voice of victory, in&s;tantly formed one phalanx, and with levelled &s;pears pu&s;hed the enemy to flight.</P>
<P>Henry Percy was taken pri&s;oner by Montgomery: and the defeat was complete. Radman, the governor of Berwick, was almo&s;t the only Engli&s;hman of note who e&s;caped: and the Scots pur&s;ued the cha&s;e for five miles. The number of the Engli&s;h &s;lain is computed at twelve hundred. Such was the battle at Otterburn, which Froi&s;&s;art repre&s;ents as the mo&s;t eminent fought in his time, for heroic bravery on both &s;ides, and the real &s;pirit of war. He al&s;o highly applauds the courte&s;y &s;hewn by the Scots to their pri&s;oners; and ob&s;erves that both nations were not le&s;s laudable for their benevolence after a battle, than for their courage during its rage <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;ar, III, f. 113.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Douglas was carried to his tent, where he &s;oon expired: but, though di&s;pirited at the lo&s;s of their leader, the Scots determined to maintain their &s;trong &s;tation again&s;t the fre&s;h Engli&s;h army which approached. For the bi&s;hop of Durham had reached Newca&s;tle, the night of the battle, with &s;even thou&s;and men, two thou&s;and of whom were cavalry: but a conjunction was prevented by Percy's impetuo&s;ity. Advancing next morning he was met by the fugitives from Otterburn, who&s;e tidings rai&s;ed &s;uch di&s;may, that all his followers fled back to Newca&s;tle, except five hundred, with whom the bi&s;hop was at la&s;t al&s;o con&s;trained to regain that city. Here he found means to in&s;pirit his followers, and the inhabitants; &s;o that he marched next morning in que&s;t of the Scots attended by ten
<PB N="41" REF="56">thou&s;and. The Scoti&s;h &s;couts, the day after, notifying his approach, their chiefs determined not to leave their camp, as they had many wounded and pri&s;oners to attend: and, when the bi&s;hop came within a mile's di&s;tance, they began all at once to &s;ound their horns in a loud di&s;cordance of warlike mu&s;ic. After a pau&s;e, the &s;ame horrible din of defiance was repeated; and the bi&s;hop arranging his ho&s;t, and advancing within two bow-&s;hots, was again &s;aluted with the thundering noi&s;e. Ob|&s;erving the &s;trength of the rude fortification, and that its po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors were too prudent to de&s;ert its advantages, the Engli&s;h, after a brief council, retreated: and the Scots having refre&s;hed them&s;elves prepared to march. Ralph Percy reque&s;ting per|mi&s;&s;ion to go to Newca&s;tle, to have his wounds attended, the Earl of Moray con&s;ented, and ordered him to be conveyed in a litter. The Scoti&s;h march, in&s;tead of triumphant &s;eemed funereal, and the joy of &s;ucce&s;s was tempered with tears; for the body of Douglas, inclo&s;ed in a coffin, and borne on a car, formed the chief object in the progre&s;s <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, III, f. 117.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The main army, under the Earl of Fife, who appears to have had but mean talents for war, was now lying near Carli&s;le; and not a little envied the &s;ucce&s;sful detachment; for the vic|tory, and the gain by ran&s;oms, were e&s;teemed the mo&s;t re|markable which had occurred &s;ince the day of Bannockburn <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P>An a&s;&s;embly of the three e&s;tates being &s;ummoned to Edin|burgh, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1389</NOTE> &s;olemnly recognized Robert Earl of Fife governor of
<PB N="42" REF="57">the kingdom; an elevation for which he was apparently as much indebted to his own intrigues, as to the age of the king, and the weakne&s;s of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Fordun, II, 414. Winton, 845.</NOTE>. The latter &s;eems, from the parliamentary acts of this reign, to have formerly &s;tood in that high capacity: and the king commonly &s;hunned the pomp, and, it is &s;u&s;pected, the duties of royalty, by re&s;iding on his parental e&s;tate, and example followed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, though impolitic in an eminent degree. Preferring the remote man|&s;ions of the Stuarts to the centrical and accu&s;tomed re&s;idences of the Scoti&s;h &s;overeigns, they &s;eemed to forget their rank, their office, their people; and removed form the &s;cene of action, from the vital heart of the kingdom, the monarch could only be &s;een by the nation in a dangerous repre&s;entative. A&s;&s;emblies of the &s;tates &s;eem to have been &s;eldom held, an ari&s;tocratic council decided upon peace and war, and upon the be&s;t intere&s;ts of the people; but this fault was common to England and mo&s;t European kingdoms at this period; while the appointment of the &s;econd &s;on, as governor of the &s;tate, to the prejudice of the heir apparent, may be regarded as a new and dangerous precedent, declarative of great weakne&s;s upon the one part, and upon the other of baneful ambition.</P>
<P>The new Regent, de&s;irous to &s;ignalize the commencement of his power, a&s;&s;embled an army on the borders again&s;t the Earl of Nottingham, Mar&s;hal of England, lately appointed Warden of the ea&s;tern marches; and who, in the u&s;ual con|comitance of pride and weakne&s;s, had reproached the Percies for the lo&s;s at Otterburn, where their army was far more numerous than that of the Scots; and boa&s;ted that he hoped to vanqui&s;h, even if oppo&s;ed by number doubling his own. But when Fife accompanied by Archibald, the &s;ucceeding Earl.
<PB N="43" REF="58">of Douglas, and by other nobles, poured his array into England, the Earl Mar&s;hal re&s;trained his men in a &s;ecure and inacce&s;&s;ible &s;tation; and to a challenge of the Regent, inviting him to de&s;cend and fulfil his threats, he replied that "he had no orders to expo&s;e the lieges of his &s;overeign to any danger." This an&s;wer was received with peals of laughter; and the Scoti&s;h army, after &s;tanding in defiance half the day with banners di&s;played, ravaged the adjacent country, and returned <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Fordun, II, 414.

<P>A re&s;pite was at length given to the war, <NOTE PLACE="marg">June</NOTE> by a truce formed between France and England for three years, in which their allies were included <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Rymer, VII, 622.</NOTE>. Tho&s;e of France were the kings of the Romans, Scotland, Arragon, Navarre; the Scoti&s;h Earl of March, the i&s;le of Man, the Duche&s;s of Brabant, the Republic of Genoa. And the allies of England were the king of the Romans, with tho&s;e of Portugal and Arragon, the Earl of Sali&s;bury, the lord&s;hip of Man, the Duke of Gelder, John Lord of the I&s;les of Scotland, and the Republic of Genoa. An emba&s;&s;y being &s;ent from England, to notify the truce, and de&s;ire the con&s;ent of Scotland, the envoys were by the Governor remitted to the king, who agreed as from deference to France. The Earls of Sali&s;bury and March appear to have been named in this truce, in con&s;equence of their claims to the i&s;le of Man, and &s;ome debateable lands upon the borders. The Lords of the I&s;les were really inde|pendent of Scotland, and by their fleets maintained their power in the i&s;les, and over the we&s;tern highlands, while the Scoti&s;h kings had no fleet to oppo&s;e them, and could not attack mountainous regions inacce&s;&s;ible to armies. The brief ard confined conque&s;ts of Alexander III and Robert I, had not
<PB N="44" REF="59">overcome the old Norwegian &s;pirit; and the Hebudes mu&s;t be regarded with truth as an independent principality, till the &s;ixteenth century: had the lords been told of their occa&s;ional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Scotland, they would have retorted by in&s;tances of the like nece&s;&s;ity forced upon that country be England.

<P>Though this monarch had been lamed by an unfortunate accident, yet his per&s;on was tall and graceful: his florid coun|tenance, and vivacious eyes, joined with the &s;nowy whitene&s;s of his beard, rendered him an object at once plea&s;ing and maje&s;tic. But his indolent meekne&s;s, his piety, his &s;aint-like humility, are fitter themes of prai&s;e to the monk than to the philo&s;opher, who knows that the virtues of a king are the virtues of ability, and of action; and that the mo&s;t acceptable &s;ervice to the Deity con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ervice of mankind. The lenity of Robert III may be vindicated from the yet new eleva|tion of a family, accu&s;tomed to regard the nobles as equals and brothers; but it unhappily tended to increa&s;e the power of the ari&s;tocracy, and add to the con&s;equent &s;tock of public calamity. Yet the years of his reign were fertile, and the people were contented: though in the continuous &s;truggles with England for political freedom, it is no wonder that in|ternal liberty made no progre&s;s; and that the Scots remembered that they were &s;oldiers, but forgot that they were men <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">For the character of Robert III compare Bowar II, 440.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The in&s;anity of Charles VI of France, which appeared this &s;ummer, and the con&s;equent di&s;tracted &s;tate of affairs in that kingdom, con&s;pired with the Engli&s;h di&s;contents, under the maladmini&s;tration of Richard II, to render a prolongation of the truce of Leilinghen expedient; and it was accordingly extended at different times to Michaelmas 1394, <NOTE PLACE="marg">16 Aug.</NOTE> and afterwards to the &s;ame term in 1398 <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Rymer, VII, 714, 769, &amp;c</NOTE>. This con&s;tant repetition of truces between England and Scotland, unknown to any other hi&s;tory, is tedious and unplea&s;ing in every view. One is led to imagine that the &s;y&s;tem of Hobbes is founded in truth, and that war is the natural &s;tate of man. But peculiar circum&s;tances contri|buted to this inveterate and lengthened enmity. The conduct of Edward I, when cho&s;en the friendly arbiter of the di&s;putes concerning the Scoti&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, was unkingly and ungenerous beyond example; and de&s;troyed the mo&s;t &s;acred rules of &s;ociety, and every bond of mutual confidence, and of public faith. It
<PB N="50" REF="65">is no wonder then that the Scoti&s;h nation had converted all their antient regard for the Engli&s;h into a rooted enmity; and that the &s;ituation of the two nations confined on one i&s;land occa&s;ioned continuous war. The ambition of &s;overeigns, that chief &s;courge of mankind, and &s;pring of &s;laughter, led the Engli&s;h kings to maintain the lofty preten&s;ions of Edward I, and untaught by experience to hope the vain conque&s;t of Scotland; nor could they abandon their claims le&s;t ju&s;tice &s;hould be interpreted want of power, and the highe&s;t wi&s;dom accounted imbecility. Such evils could ari&s;e from the ambition of one man! The inadmi&s;&s;ion, or dubious grant, of the title of the Scoti&s;h &s;overeigns, was an in&s;ult to them, and to the nation; which, with the unju&s;t preten&s;ions on the one &s;ide, and jealou&s;y and revenge on the other, precluded all hopes of &s;olid and la&s;ting peace. When we find Henry VIII, in 1542, repeating the extravagant claims of the fir&s;t Edward, almo&s;t in his own words, we mu&s;t exult in tho&s;e happy events which terminated a di&s;cord that threatened to be perpetual <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">In 1394 occur two letters from Annabella queen of Scotland to Richard II.

<P>Henry's lenity and moderation, during the whole of this expedition, were remarkable, and &s;ufficiently contra&s;t his character with that of Richard II; who&s;e outrage proclaims his weakne&s;s; while this inva&s;ion &s;hewed that cruelty and de&s;truction are &s;eldom the companions of courage and wi&s;dom. To the towns, villages, mona&s;teries, and even fortre&s;&s;es, which &s;ubmitted, he in&s;tantly &s;ent a banner, painted with his arms, to be di&s;played as the fixed &s;ignal that none of his army &s;hould approach them. And when two Canons of Holyroodhou&s;e came into his pre&s;ence at Leith, to reque&s;t the pre&s;ervation of their mona&s;tery, he an&s;wered with great affability, "Far be from my arms the di&s;grace of mole&s;ting any holy church, and e&s;pe|cially your's, in which my father, the duke of Lanca&s;ter, found a refuge. I am my&s;elf half a Scoti&s;hman, being a Comyn by
<PB N="59" REF="74">maternal de&s;cent; and I call God to witne&s;s that nothing but gro&s;s provocation could have brought me here as a foe. But there are in your government people who write letters in a &s;ingular &s;tyle: and my intention is little to injure the country, but to &s;ee if the writer dare to maintain his words, by meeting in battle him whom he terms a traitor." Finding that Albany declined an engagement, and not thinking the ca&s;tle of Edin|burgh an object worthy of longer delay, or de&s;pairing of taking that fortre&s;s; perhaps even unwilling to expo&s;e to the chance of de&s;truction a place which had afforded an a&s;ylum to his father; Henry rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and withdrew his army into England <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 430. Winton, 881, mentions the de&s;truction of the hou&s;e of Dalhou&s;ie, as the &s;ole ravage of Henry's arms.</NOTE>. It is not improbable, at the &s;ame time, that a failure of provi&s;ion, and the rumoured in&s;urrection of Owen Glendour in Wales, afforded &s;trong arguments for this retreat.</P>
<P>But if it be difficult to account for the motives of Henry, what are we to think of tho&s;e of Albany upon this occa&s;ion? At the head of a numerous army, he was the idle &s;pectator of a triumphant enemy in the heart of his country; and beheld with indifference the danger of the heir apparent, who&s;e ran&s;om mu&s;t have co&s;t the nation an immen&s;e &s;um. The prudence of declining a battle with the force of England, conducted by the monarch, &s;eems to have been fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in Scoti&s;h politics, by the latter maxims of Robert I: and the modern axiom, that battles are the i&s;&s;ue of ignorance, and that a weak general fights when he knows not what to do, was apparently not unknown in former times. So much may be offered in Albany's vindication. But the character of this man will &s;oon develope all its blackne&s;s; and the con&s;i&s;tency of wicked am|bition mu&s;t force us to infer that, to &s;uch a mind, ba&s;e motives
<PB N="60" REF="75">mu&s;t be the mo&s;t effectual. Our ancient accounts a&s;cribe Albany's conduct to a previous enmity with Roth&s;ay <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 430.</NOTE>; and it is probable that this gallant youth, con&s;cious of his birth and expected royalty, &s;aw with impatience his father, his king, his country, under &s;uch mean controul. Apparently a coward, certainly unknown in war, Albany might from ba&s;ene&s;s decline the combat with a bold and capable monarch; and from yet greater ba&s;ene&s;s might have exulted to &s;ee, in the capture or death of Roth&s;ay, the &s;ecurity, the prolongation, of his re|gency.</P>
<P>Some events, which preceded the Engli&s;h inva&s;ion, have been re&s;erved to this place, in order to pre&s;ent a clear and connected account of internal tran&s;actions in Scotland, in|tere&s;ting and important in an eminent degree. The King's infirmities increa&s;ed with his age, and the Duke of Albany mu&s;t be regarded as the chief agent, in affairs, which, from the monarch's re&s;idence on di&s;tant parental e&s;tates, &s;ometimes hardly reached the royal ear, except by the voice of the nation. It is to be regreted that the meagrene&s;s of our annals &s;eldom permits a near acquaintance with hi&s;torical characters, till the reign of the fir&s;t James. Su&s;pended in the darkne&s;s of igno|rance, and the di&s;tance of time, the portraits rarely appear di&s;tinct, except when enlightened by the &s;plendor of the diadem. Hence ari&s;es a barrenne&s;s in an intere&s;ting province of hi&s;tory, the varied and &s;trong delineation of character, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to form ju&s;t and complete ideas of important events.</P>
<P>The Duke of Roth&s;ay had now attained his twenty &s;econd year; and his mental features nearly re&s;emble tho&s;e of the prince of Wales his contemporary. That warm efferve&s;cence of vigorous youth, which tamed by rea&s;on, experience, and
<PB N="61" REF="76">time, affords mature materials of a firm and &s;pirited character, had led him into &s;ome exce&s;&s;es, e&s;pecially of the amorous kind, which afforded pretexts of con&s;traint from his uncle the go|vernor, and of reproof from his royal parents. A fondne&s;s for riotous pa&s;time and arch roguery were al&s;o laid to the prince's charge; who, to candid eyes, &s;ufficiently compen&s;ated the&s;e youthful and trivial defects by his good qualities. Endued with a comely per&s;on, an hone&s;t heart, an able head, a mo&s;t &s;weet and affable temper, and even deeply tinctured with learning for that century, his virtues, and not his vices, at|tracted the regent's enmity <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 431.

<P>Robert III only knew his own &s;on from the malicious reports of Albany; but the queen Annablella, formerly famed for beauty, and &s;till for &s;en&s;e, &s;pirit, and genero&s;ity, was not the dupe of &s;uch practices, and appears to have &s;ugge&s;ted the marriage of the prince, as a proper and u&s;ual expedient to overcome his wildne&s;s, by the &s;weetne&s;s of lawful love, and dome&s;tic ties. This project mu&s;t have alarmed Albany, and he employed every re&s;ource of little cunning to defeat it, while he did not dare a public oppo&s;ition. To bring the &s;cheme into contempt, to gratify his own avarice, to &s;ow di&s;&s;entions and ob&s;tacles, to procure delay and perhaps abandonment, he held up the marriage of his prince to &s;ale among the peers of Scotland, in&s;tead of demanding a foreign prince&s;s, who&s;e con|nexions might have aided her hu&s;band, and have overturned
<PB N="62" REF="77">the regent's ambitious plans. The Earl of March, a friend of Albany, was the highe&s;t bidder; and having paid a large &s;um, his daughter Elizabeth was affianced to Roth&s;ay. But at the in&s;tigation of the king's council, the Earl of Douglas, Archibald the Grim, oftered a larger &s;um, which was al&s;o received; and the regent not daring to trifle with that illu&s;trious family, the prince actually married Marjory, the daughter of Douglas, at Bothwell <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 428.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The only excu&s;e oftered to March was, that the con&s;ent of the three e&s;tates had not been procured to the marriage; and as no meeting of parliament is mentioned, it is to be pre&s;umed that in this rude age the king's council, con&s;i&s;ting of members clerical, noble, and common, was regarded as repre&s;enting the three e&s;tates, when inconvenient to &s;ummon that formidable body. Nay the repayment of the &s;um advanced was refu&s;ed, or delayed; and March, burning with indignation, procured a &s;afe conduct from the king of England, and retired to that country, leaving his ca&s;tle of Dunbar in the cu&s;tody of Sir Robert Maitland <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t letter of March to Henry, as above mentioned, is dated Dunbar, 18 Feb. It &s;tates that he is greatly wronged by Roth&s;ay, who e&s;pou&s;ed his daughter, and though bound by his letter and &s;eal, is about to marry another: the earl reque&s;ts help as the kin&s;man of Henry, Alice de Beaumont being <HI>gud-dame</HI> (grand-mother) of Henry, and Marjory Comyn her full &s;i&s;ter, <HI>gud-dame</HI> of March. He offers his own allegiance, and that of his va&s;&s;als: de&s;ires that lord Furneval, or We&s;tmoreland, be &s;ent to confer with him; and a &s;afe conduct for him&s;elf and 100 followers. After apologizing for writing in Engli&s;h, as he under&s;tands that &s;peech better than latin or French, he &s;igns in French, "Le Count de la Marche d'E&s;coce." Ve&s;p. F. VII, f. 22. Furneval was &s;ent, ib. f. 39, n. 2. On the 13th of March We&s;tmoreland was commi&s;&s;ioned to enquire the determination of the Scoti&s;h earl. Ib. f. 78. But the preci&s;e date of March's retreat into England is not apparent; though it &s;eems that he remained in Scotland till he met Henry at Newca&s;tle on the 25th of July. See Redpath, 369.</NOTE>. After the retreat of Henry an army was
<PB N="63" REF="78">rai&s;ed to be&s;iege that important fortre&s;s, which if betrayed to the Engli&s;h, might have afforded a dangerous po&s;t to the enemy; and Robert III him&s;elf appeared as general: but, before he reached Dunbar, Maitland was intimidated and yielded the ca&s;tle to the &s;on of Douglas <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 429.</NOTE>. If the Scoti&s;h king had no opportunity to &s;hew his martial talents, he at lea&s;t evinced his goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice in this expedition. After waiting at Hadington three days, till various reinforcements arrived, the army prepared to march, the trumpets &s;ounded, and the king's foot was in the &s;tirrup to mount his hor&s;e, when a poor butcher begged an audience. The complaint was again&s;t an officer of the royal hou&s;hold, who had not paid for the meats ordered: the monarch heard the claim affably and pati|ently, and &s;ent for the officer: who not being found he paid the &s;um him&s;elf. He then ordered a proclamation at the market cro&s;s that all debts due by his attendants &s;hould be in&s;tantly demanded and paid; and in future always ob&s;erved this cu&s;tom on leaving any place; an u&s;eful example to his &s;ubjects, in an age when different &s;tatutes were required to enforce a like practice in the nobles. The people upon this occa&s;ion, remembered with plea&s;ure his &s;imilar conduct at his coronation, when he ordered payment to the mona&s;tery of Scone, for the growing corn trodden under foot by the mul|titude <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 418, 419.</NOTE>. Such matters are often e&s;teemed beneath the dignity of hi&s;tory; but far be that pride which would prevent a good action to the meane&s;t of mankind, or its commemoration; and if this hi&s;toric dignity be inimical to amiable views of manners, and to humanity, it is rather an object of &s;corn than of admiration.</P>
<P>Though, in November and December, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1401</NOTE> &s;ome conferences between the Engli&s;h and Scoti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners had been held,
<PB N="64" REF="79">only truces of a few weeks had been adju&s;ted <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Rymer, VIII, 166, 185.</NOTE>; and the war &s;oon re&s;umed its depredations. Henry's demands were ex|orbitant, as he had been irritated by Robert's neglect, and by being treated as an u&s;urper. The Engli&s;h monarch in|&s;tructed his commi&s;&s;ioners to require the homage of Scotland; if refu&s;ed, an annuity, or lands, were held out as temptations to Robert: &s;hould this preten&s;ion prove fruitle&s;s, a marriage treaty beween their families was to be propo&s;ed, or at lea&s;t a truce of thirty years <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">In&s;tructions Ve&s;p.

<P>Robert in vain demanded that March &s;hould be delivered up: and that earl required the re&s;titution of his e&s;tates with as little &s;ucce&s;s. Henry IV knew from experience the value of a traitor, and extended to March, his friends and followers, the warme&s;t protection. Eager to wipe off the &s;tain of his captivity, Henry Percy joined March, who was inflamed with revange, and anxious to evince his importance by his &s;ervices; <NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Feb.</NOTE> and they entered Scotland, at the head of two thou&s;and cho&s;en men. Piercing by Peebles to Linton, they a&s;&s;aulted without &s;ucce&s;s the ca&s;tle of Hales, burned three villages, and encamped at Pre&s;ton. But the &s;on of the Earl of Douglas, advancing from Edinburgh again&s;t them, with a body of his followers, they made a precipitate retreat, leaving their &s;poils, and tents, and prepared provi&s;ions. The Scots pur&s;ued them a whole dreary night of that &s;ea&s;on of the year, and captured many at Colbrand's-path, the re&s;t e&s;caping to Berwick; at the very gates of which town the lance, and pennon, of the lord Thomas Talbot were taken <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 429.</NOTE>. The heir of Douglas a few
<PB N="65" REF="80">months after wore the brilliant coronet of that hou&s;e, upon the death of his father Archibald, &s;urnamed the Grim, a peer recommended to fame by his wi&s;dom, as much as by his here|ditary valour <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 429.
<P>The&s;e events have been dated 1400 by our hi&s;torians, mi&s;led by Bowar's inattention to the commencement of the year; but the preceding narrative, and notes, evince them to belong to 1401. Redpath, 369, &s;hews little acumen in not being able to &s;olve &s;o &s;lender a perplexity.</P>

<P>This year forms an epoch in the hi&s;tory of Scoti&s;h legi&s;lation, the more important, as, after the various laws of Robert II, no further intelligence ari&s;es, till the luminous period com|mences with the &s;tatutes of James I.</P>
<P>The ordinances pa&s;&s;ed in a parliament held at Scone are <NOTE PLACE="marg">21 Feb.</NOTE> numerous <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The&s;e laws are publi&s;hed by Skene, in his collection known by the name of Regiam Maje&s;tatem, from the fir&s;t words of a treati&s;e prefixt. They were extant in the Regi&s;ter in his time, as he mentions in his tract De Ver|borum Significatione; and their authenticity is unque&s;tioned. See al&s;o MS. Harley, 4700. The date is accurately marked in that MS. and by Skene.</NOTE>. Many concern private property, then in an ob|&s;cure and precarious condition, under the feudal oppre&s;&s;ion, and rapacity of the great: but the following chiefly de&s;erve hi&s;torical commemoration. It was decreed that the king's lieutenant-general the Earl of Fife, and other royal mini&s;ters, &s;hould hear the cau&s;es of churchmen, widows, orphans, and minors, without taking &s;ureties, and judge without delay: that, during the papal &s;chi&s;m, any excommunicated per&s;on might appeal to the con&s;ervator of the church, and after|wards
<PB N="66" REF="81">to the general congregation of the clergy; that the duel &s;hould only be permitted in four ca&s;es, the crime mu&s;t infer death, it mu&s;t be &s;ecretly de&s;igned or perpetrated, the &s;u&s;picions mu&s;t bear veri&s;imilitude, and the truth was not to be di&s;covered by witne&s;&s;es or writings. Among the cau&s;es why gifts are revocable, are cla&s;&s;ed the arts of monks in per&s;uading the laity to donations. U&s;ury, or intere&s;t, is not to be allowed again&s;t a minor, who is only to pay the principal. As a check on the &s;heriffs, their clerks are to be appointed by the king, and only amenable to him, to prevent any connivance in inju&s;tice. The ju&s;ticiary courts are to be held twice in the year, on either &s;ide of the Forth: the coroner is empowered to arre&s;t per&s;ons indicted: the lords of regalities, &s;heriffs, and barons, are to hold their journies of ju&s;tice twice in the year, and abbreviate the terms of appearance: the king's ju&s;ticiary may remove &s;heriffs, or other royal officers in ca&s;e of default, till the fitting of the next parliament, which is to judge the cau&s;e; a &s;ingular &s;tatute, confounding the legi&s;lative and executive powers. "To prevent the great and horrible ravages depre|dations, fires, and homicides, which are daily committed in every part of the kingdom, it is ordained that all the &s;heriffs in the realm make public proclamations, that no per&s;on tra|velling &s;hall be allowed more attendants than tho&s;e who&s;e maintenance he defrays." Ravagers, depredators, incendiaries, robbers, murderers, are to be puni&s;hed by death and confi&s;cation. The &s;heriff &s;hall arre&s;t malefactors, and take bail for their ap|pearance at the next journey of ju&s;tice, or circuit; their nonappearance infers rebellion, and forfeiture of the bail; if no bail be found, they are at once to be tried by an a&s;&s;ize, and if found guilty forfeit their lives; if they flee from one &s;heriffdom to another, the fir&s;t &s;heriff is to &s;end a precept to the &s;econd for their deliverance to trial; a &s;imilar procedure is
<PB N="67" REF="82">to be u&s;ed to lords, and officers of regalities, and all lieges are to a&s;&s;i&s;t. Among the more minute &s;tatutes, may be named, that allowing the lieges to purcha&s;e victuals where they plea&s;e, on paying the cu&s;toms; that again&s;t burning the heath of moors in &s;ummer, or autumn, when the corn might be damaged; tho&s;e again&s;t the killing of &s;almon, or hares, at prohibited &s;ea&s;ons; that which orders farmers, who rent lands for a term, not to alienate the lea&s;e for a term exceeding the agreement.

<P>The effects of March's vengeance have already been nar|rated; but a &s;cene of a blacker and more deplorable kind is now to open, in the murder of the Duke of Roth&s;ay. The power and &s;en&s;e of the queen, the gravity of Trail bi&s;hop of St. Andrews, a chief promoter of concord, the valour and wi&s;dom of the fir&s;t Archibald Earl of Douglas, had balanced the ambition of Albany, but the&s;e three &s;upporters of the monarchy died within a &s;hort period <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The fourth pe&s;tilence which had ravaged Scotland appeared in 1401; but it appears not that any of the&s;e great per&s;ons fell a victim to it. Winton, 884.</NOTE>, and the governor's pa&s;&s;ions had no longer any controul, &s;ave from Roth&s;ay's merit, and ju&s;t preten&s;ions. Archibald the &s;econd Earl of Douglas of that name, born to adorn that family by his valour, but to di&s;grace it by his conduct, was married to the elder daughter of Robert III, as his father had e&s;pou&s;ed a daughter of the preceding king. Thus doubly connected with the royal family, he &s;eems to have regarded Roth&s;ay, who had wedded his &s;i&s;ter, not with fraternal affection, but with the malevolent eyes of a rival in ambition. Joined in &s;trict friend&s;hip with
<PB N="68" REF="83">Albany, and his &s;econd &s;on John afterwards Earl of Buchan; and mi&s;led by their offers, or by a pique at Roth&s;ay, he &s;hared their dete&s;table &s;chemes. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1402</NOTE> The young prince had been married about two years, but had no children; and perhaps hating the wife forced upon him by his uncle's avarice, he pur&s;ued his former cour&s;es. Albany, on pretence of re&s;training his wildne&s;s, had &s;et a band of his parti&s;ans to watch his conduct; and now that the occa&s;ion opened the regent gave the hint, and this band repre&s;ented to the king that his &s;on would no longer bear coun&s;el, nor re&s;traint. Indeed this impudent plan of Albany, this council of guardians appointed to watch a man of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, and that man the heir of royalty, was a certain mode to irritate and inflame youthful pa&s;&s;ions, but never could tend to moderate their influence. The decrepit and infirm monarch was, as u&s;ual, di&s;tant from the public &s;cene, and guided by tho&s;e around him; among whom was now unhappily one Ramorgny, a knight who had formerly &s;ugge&s;ted to Roth&s;ay the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Albany, but the generous nature of the prince had rejected the propo&s;al with horror and indig|nation. A &s;ucce&s;sful criminal may be honoured; but a crime offered, and refu&s;ed, expo&s;es the character to certain hatred and contempt; and it is not matter of wonder that Ramorgny became in his turn the bitter enemy of Roth&s;ay. At his &s;ug|ge&s;tion, which may be con&s;trued that of Albany, Robert &s;ent a written order to the regent, to arre&s;t his &s;on, and confine him for a &s;hort time, in order to &s;ubdue his &s;tubborn &s;pirit; forgetful of the certain di&s;grace which the confinement of the heir apparent mu&s;t entail on his reign, perhaps on the future; forgetful of the &s;tain on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and danger of con&s;e|quent di&s;affection in the &s;ubjects; forgetful how &s;hort a path leads a prince from the pri&s;on to the grave.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="84">The royal mandate was born by Ramorgny and by another enemy of Roth&s;ay, Sir William Lind&s;ay, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter Euphemia had al&s;o been affianced to the prince, and rejected <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 432.</NOTE>. From the&s;e circum&s;tances it may be perceived that the &s;cheme was laid, and conducted with all the deep and dark art of con&s;um|mate villainy. Albany, receiving the order with joy, re&s;olved on its immediate enforcement, and that the bearers &s;hould be the executors. Privacy was nece&s;&s;ary; and Roth&s;ay was in|veigled into Fife, upon pretence that he &s;hould take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for the king of the ca&s;tle of St. Andrews, till the appointment of another bi&s;hop. When the un&s;u&s;pecting prince was riding with a &s;mall attendance, between Nydie and Straburn, near St. Andrews, he was &s;eized, and held a pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle, till the governor and his council, a&s;&s;embled at Culros, &s;hould determine the place of his confinement. The tower of Falk|land was named; and thither Albany and Douglas, with a &s;trong band of followers, conducted the prince, &s;eated on a labouring hor&s;e, and covered with a ru&s;&s;et cloke, to defend him from the falling rain.

In this pardon, which is extant, the confinement of the prince is a&s;cribed to the cau&s;e of public utility; but the immediate motives of the perpetrators are expre&s;sly &s;aid to be concealed for a &s;ufficient rea&s;on <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">This curious paper is pre&s;erved in the 4to Regi&s;ter often quoted, f. v. 12, whence it was publi&s;hed by Sir David Dalrymple, Remarks, p. 278.</NOTE>. Does this &s;ingular declaration refer to the king's mandate, which might in the vulgar eye have appeared a con&s;ent to the death of his &s;on; or to &s;ome crime fal&s;ely imputed to Roth&s;ay by the con&s;pirators, as for example a de&s;ign to murder his father, or uncle? This is dark: but it is certain that folly and wickedne&s;s are companions, and that the means u&s;ed by Albany to clear his character are preci&s;ely tho&s;e which fully e&s;tabli&s;h his guilt.</P>
<P>To divert the public attention, it was re&s;olved to continue the war with England, which had been interrupted by a short
<PB N="71" REF="86">truce, and &s;ome negotiations for peace <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">In Ve&s;p. F.

From the&s;e letters it appears that on the 16th May 1401, (&s;ee in Rymer, VIII, 190, a truce of 26th April 1401) Douglas and Northumberland had met at Camel&s;path, and agreed to a truce of a year to Martinmas 1402: Douglas complains that Northumberland does not ob&s;erve the treaty.

By the advice and &s;upport of the young earl of Douglas, then re&s;ident at Dunbar, the chief landholders of Lothian agreed to conduct &s;eparate expeditions into England, becau&s;e the people of the Mer&s;e favoured the exiled earl, and did not exert their u&s;ual inroads. The leader of the fir&s;t incur&s;ion was John Haliburton of Dirlton, who advanced a con&s;iderable way into the inimical country, carrying fire and ravage in his pro|gre&s;s, and returned with &s;ucce&s;s and &s;poil. But the &s;econd, conducted by Patrick Hepburn of Hales, met with a different fate; for having advanced too far into England, and remained too long, the Earl of March found time to unite the power of Northumberland with his own, and to intercept Hepburn and his followers in their return, <NOTE PLACE="marg">22 June</NOTE> at We&s;t-Ni&s;bet in the Mer&s;e, three miles &s;outh of Duns.

<P>Douglas, &s;tung with regret for the lo&s;s of his brave friends and countrymen, and inflamed with rage again&s;t March, his particular enemy, immediately applied to Albany for a body of troops, to be added to his own power upon an expedition into England. The governor con&s;ented, and di&s;patched a con&s;iderable force under Murdac his elde&s;t &s;on; the earls of Angus and Moray al&s;o joined Douglas, who entered England with an army of ten thou&s;and men, carrying terror and de|va&s;tation to the walls of Newca&s;tle. Henry IV was now engaged in the Welch war again&s;t Owen Glendour; but the earl of Northumberland, and his &s;on the Hot&s;pur Percy, with the earl of March, collected a numerous array; and awaited the return of the Scots, impeded with &s;poil, near Milfield, in the northern part of Northumberland. Douglas had reached Wooler, in his return; and perceiving the enemy, &s;eized a &s;trong po&s;t between the two armies, called Homildon hill. In this method he rivalled his predece&s;&s;or at the battle of Otterburn, <NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Sept.</NOTE> but not with like &s;ucce&s;s. The Engli&s;h advanced
<PB N="73" REF="88">to the a&s;&s;ault, and Henry Percy was about to lead them up the hill, when March caught his bridle, and advi&s;ed him to advance no further, but to pour the dreadful &s;hower of Engli&s;h arrows into the enemy. This advice was followed with the u&s;ual fortune; for in all ages the bow was the Engli&s;h in&s;tru|ment of victory, and though the Scots, and perhaps the French, were &s;uperior in the u&s;e of the &s;pear, yet this weapon was u&s;ele&s;s after the di&s;tant bow had decided the combat. Robert the Great, &s;en&s;ible of this, at the battle of Banocburn ordered a prepared detachment of cavalry, to ru&s;h among the Engli&s;h archers at the commencement, totally to di&s;per&s;e them, and &s;top the deadly effu&s;ion. But Douglas now u&s;ed no &s;uch pre|caution; and the con&s;equence was that his people, drawn up on the face of a hill, pre&s;ented one general mark to the enemy, none of who&s;e arrows de&s;cended in vain. The Scots fell without &s;ight, and unrevenged, till a &s;pirited knight, Swinton, exclaimed aloud, "O my brave countrymen! what fa&s;cination has &s;eized you to-day that you &s;tand like deer to be &s;hot, in&s;tead of indulging your antient courage, and meeting your enemies hand to hand? Let tho&s;e who will, de&s;cend with me, that we may gain victory, or life, or fall like men." This being heard by Adam Gordon, between whom and Swinton there exi&s;ted an antient and deadly feud, attended with the mutual &s;laughter of many followers, he in&s;tantly fell on his knees before Swinton, begged his pardon; and de&s;ired to be dubbed a knight by him whom he mu&s;t now regard as the wi&s;e&s;t, and bolde&s;t of that order in Britain. The ceremony performed, Swinton and Gordon de&s;cended the hill, accompanied only by one hundred men; and a de&s;perate valour led the whole body to death. Had a &s;imilar &s;pirit been &s;hown by the Scoti&s;h army, it is probable that the event of the day would have been dif|ferent. Douglas, who was certainly deficient in the mo&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="89">important qualities of a general, &s;eeing his army begin to di&s;per&s;e, at length attempted to de&s;cend the hill; but the Engli&s;h archers, retiring a little, &s;ent a flight of arrows &s;o &s;harp and &s;trong that no armour could with&s;tand; and the Scoti&s;h leader him&s;elf, who&s;e panoply was of remarkable temper, fell under five wounds, though not mortal. The Engli&s;h men of arms, knights of &s;quires, did not &s;trike one blow, but remained &s;pectators of the rout, which was now complete. Great numbers of the Scots were &s;lain, and near five hundred peri&s;hed in the river Tweed upon their flight. Among the illu&s;trious captives were Douglas, who&s;e chief wound deprived him of an eye; Murdac &s;on of Albany; the Earls of Moray, and Angus; and about twenty four gentlemen of eminent rank and power. The chief &s;lain were Swinton, Gordon, Living&s;ton of Calendar, Ram&s;ay of Dalhou&s;ie, Walter Sinclair, Roger Gordon, Walter Scot, and others.

Stuart, a man of wi&s;dom and eloquence, defended him&s;elf &s;o well that he was acquitted by three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive juries; but the malice of Percy led him to appoint a new jury of his followers, and Stuart was drawn and quartered, amid&s;t the murmurs of the Engli&s;h, who knew that his merit was the only cau&s;e of his death <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 434.

<P>Henry IV, on receiving intelligence of the battle of Ho|mildon, de&s;ired the Percies not to ran&s;om, nor deliver, their pri&s;oners, without his con&s;ent: and, to palliate this apparently har&s;h mandate, he generou&s;ly granted the earldom of Douglas, with E&s;kdale, Lid&s;dale, Lauderdale, the lord&s;hip of Selkirk, fore&s;t of Ettrick, county of Tividale, and all the other appen|dages of that high hou&s;e, to the Earl of Northumberland; who &s;miled at this liberal gift of a country, neither conquered, nor likely to be an object of ea&s;y &s;eizure <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Rymer, VIII, 278, 289.</NOTE>. But the Percies re&s;olved to take the king in his own &s;nare, and to make this conque&s;t the pretended object of arms, in&s;tantly to be turned again&s;t the granter.

<P>An incident occurred, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1403</NOTE> which contributes to paint the features of the times and of the government.

He was &s;uddenly &s;urprized in his ca&s;tle by a band of ruffians, and impri&s;oned till he died of his hard captivity. In the next year, a decent term having expired, Alexander Stuart, natural &s;on of Alex|ander the decea&s;ed earl of Buchan, brother of Albany, forced the counte&s;s to wed him; and as he was a noted leader of the highland freebooters there is no room to doubt that he had been the murderer of her hu&s;band, in order to attain this wealthy marriage. The&s;e unworthy deeds were &s;anctioned by the government; the king's name being boldly &s;et, by the regent, to a charter confirming the earldom to a lawle&s;s in|truder <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Winton, 888, 889.

Albany a&s;&s;embling a council of prelates and nobles at Falkland, laid the affair before them; and they knowing him little in|clined to war, pretended that it was better to give up that paltry turret, than encounter further danger from England, when the Scots were weakened and di&s;heartened by the late defeat. Upon which, to their &s;urprize, the regent who ap|parently had intelligence of the commotion rai&s;ed by the Percies, and that the north of England was incapable either

David Fleming of Cumbernald, a relation of the king, and &s;everal chief gentlemen of Lothian, conducted the prince, and &s;aw him &s;afe on board: on their return they were pur&s;ued by James Douglas, uncle of the earl, and a conflict followed at Herman&s;ton moor, <NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Feb.</NOTE> in which Fleming and many others fell <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 439. Winton, 895.&mdash;Wal&s;ingham, 416, 417, informs us that Fleming was &s;lain in revenge for his advice to Northumberland to e&s;cape into Wales, as the Scoti&s;h nobles intended to have delivered him up in exchange for one or two of the peers captured at Homildon. If &s;o this event mu&s;t have happened in 1406. The gro&s;s errors of chronology in Bowar, Winton, and even our later hi&s;torians, occa&s;ion perpetual difficulties. That Robert III died on the 4th of April 1406, is evinced beyond all doubt by the learned Ruddiman, in his notes on Buchanan, p. 436; who at the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;es his opinion that the prince was captured in 1405, as Bowar's incon&s;i&s;tent account bears that the capture happened on the 30th March, and that the father died of grief on the 28th March; while Winton expre&s;sly dates the&s;e events in the years 1405 and 1406. It is clear from our hi&s;torians, and Wal&s;ingham, that the earl of Orkney accompanied the prince; and he was a captive in England in Aug. 1405, when his brothers were permitted to vi&s;it England, as may be inferred from Rymer, VIII, 410; on the 13th Sept. 1405, a &s;afe conduct was granted to Orkney, then a pri&s;oner, to vi&s;it Scotland, (his brothers apparently ho&s;tages,) Rymer, VIII, 415. Yet it is &s;ingular that no mention of the prince occurs in any writing of that year. John &s;on of Henry &s;ays, in a letter to his father, Ve&s;p. F. VII, f 95, n. 2, that Orkney had joined Northumberland and Bardolf at Berwick: the letter is dated Durham, 9 June, in all appearance 1405. Yet Bowar and Winton agree that Orkney and the prince were captured in March or April. The &s;ame writers concur that Fleming was &s;lain, on his return from accompanying the prince on &s;hip-board: yet Wal&s;ingham &s;eems rightly to place the &s;laughter in 1406: he is however mi&s;taken in dating the capture 1406, as appears from the pa&s;&s;ports to Orkney. When the materials are &s;o complex, and di&s;cordant, the candour of the reader mu&s;t be reque&s;ted.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE character of Robert Duke of Albany requires but a few features, to fini&s;h the delineation, which has already pre&s;ented it&s;elf in his actions. He approached his &s;eventieth year, when, by various arts and crimes, he attained the great object of his pur&s;uits, in the &s;ole government of Scotland. His per&s;on was tall, and maje&s;tic, his countenance amiable: temperance, affability, eloquence, real genero&s;ity, apparent benignity, a degree of cool prudence bordering upon wi&s;dom, may be reckoned among his virtues. But the &s;hades of his vices are deeper; an in&s;atiate ambition, unrelenting cruelty, and its attendant cowardice, or at lea&s;t an ab&s;olute defect of military fame, a contempt of the be&s;t human affections, a long practice in all the dark paths of art and di&s;&s;imulation.
<PB N="86" REF="101">His admini&s;tration he &s;tudied to recommend, not by promoting the public good, but by &s;haring the &s;poils of the monarchy with the nobles, by a patient connivance at their enormities, by a dazzling pomp of expenditure in the plea&s;ures of the fea&s;t, and in the conciliation of munificence. As fortune pre&s;erved his government from any &s;ignal un&s;ucce&s;s, &s;o it would be an abu&s;e of terms to be&s;tow upon a wary management, which only regarded his own intere&s;t, the prai&s;e of political wi&s;dom <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">For the character of Robert duke of Albany compare Bowar, p. 466, "convivus quotidianus . . . vir magnarum expen&s;arum, et extraneis munificus. Erat enim forma praecipuus, corpore procerus et altus," &amp;c. with Winton, p. 900, 901, who prai&s;es his beauty, &s;trength, wi&s;dom, religion, hatred of heretics, cha&s;tity, &s;obriety, maje&s;tic deportment, affability, attachment to the clergy, and to the commons; and, from two or three lines in the pa&s;&s;age, evidently wrote this part after the death of Albany in 1419, though the hi&s;troical events of his work relative to Scotland clo&s;e in 1407. But the&s;e old writers uniformly prai&s;e the great; both belonged to the church, which was eminently favoured by Albany. Winton lived under his regency, and in his earldom of Fife; and Bowar often follows Winton. Their indi&s;criminate prai&s;e is over|come by the indubitable evidence of fact and record.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The three e&s;tates, having met in parliament at Perth, &s;oon after the demi&s;e of the late king, decency con&s;trained them formally to recognize the title of the captive prince to the &s;overeignty; but the regency and &s;ole command of affairs were ratified to Albany <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Winton, 899.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1407</NOTE> The treaty with France was renewed: and the truce with England continuing, the regent &s;ent em|ba&s;&s;adors to adju&s;t any differences which had ari&s;en, yet appears not to have even mentioned his captive nephew <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The renewal of the French league, Feb. 1407, may be found in the 4to Regi&s;ter, fol. v. 61, and MS.

Henry's letter to John, his &s;on, concerning the prolongation of the truce for a year, occurs Ve&s;p. F. VII, f. 106, n. 2. Albany's letter appears, f. 111, dated 2 March, and &s;tates that the Scoti&s;h emba&s;&s;adors, Sir William Grame, and Sir John Stuart, having been well received, the regent had called a parliament to con&s;ider Henry's an&s;wer; and the truce was prolonged from next ea&s;ter to that in the en&s;uing year. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury advi&s;ed Henry, (Ve&s;p. F. VII, f. 88.) to in&s;i&s;t that "the fool calling him&s;elf king Richard" &s;hould be given up; but the king &s;eems to have pa&s;&s;ed this matter with due contempt, though in 1404 Serle yeoman of the robes to Richard II came from Scotland to England, and had per&s;uaded many that Richard was alive. He was executed. MS. Harl. 266, 5 H 4.</NOTE>. But a more

Many Scots now crouded to the Engli&s;h court, &s;ome in the hopes of admi&s;&s;ion to the pre|&s;ence of their young &s;overeign, and of attracting his favour by their attentions: and others from various motives. Among the&s;e was Alexander Stuart, who had become Earl of Mar by the unwarrantable means above recited; he appointed a tourna|ment of Engli&s;h and Scots in which the latter were defeated: but his re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit carrying him into Flanders, in the fol|lowing year, he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the &s;ervice of the Duke of Burgundy, who had &s;ent him to a&s;&s;i&s;t in quelling a rebellion of the people of Liege, again&s;t their bi&s;hop John of Bavaria <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Winton's two la&s;t chapters, p. 902&mdash;916, relate to Mar's actions; his vi&s;it to England in 1407, the tournaments there (&s;ee Otterburn 260;) his voyage to France in 1408, p. 904, pa&s;&s;age thence to Flanders, p. 905; the conte&s;ts at Liege between John of Bavaria and Horn; Mar joins Burgundy in the war again&s;t Liege, p. 910; the death of Horn, p. 913; the council of Con&s;tance, 1414; the marriage of John of Bavaria to Elizabeth of Brabant, 1418; that of Mar to a Brabantine lady, and his return to Scotland, (1409?) p. 916 Compare Divaeus, Rer.

VII, f. 77, n. 1, te&s;tifies his gratitude for the king's courte&s;y to Mar, to Murdac, and to Douglas.
<P>It is doubtful what is the real date of the following events, narrated by Mon&s;trelet, Tome I, c. 35, edit. 1518, under the year 1407. The prince of Wales, &s;ays that writer, accompanied by his uncles, and an army of 1000 men at arms, and 6000 archers, (about 12,000 in all) proceeded about <HI>Tous &s;aints</HI> (1 Nov.) to make war in Scotland. The <HI>king</HI> of Scotland then at <HI>St. Janjon,</HI> (St. John&s;town, Perth,) in the middle of his kingdom, a&s;&s;embled a large army under <HI>Douglas</HI> and Buchan; but he found the Engli&s;h too powerful, and &s;ent emba&s;&s;adors to conclude a truce of one year.

<P><PB N="88" REF="103">The Earl of March di&s;appointed in his hopes of the conque&s;t and grant of his e&s;tates, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1408</NOTE> by the Engli&s;h monarch, was not indi&s;po&s;ed to return to his own country; and the regent and the nobles of Scotland knew, from experience, that his en|mity, and his friend&s;hip, were not unimportant. A new government having taken place, Albany could now throw the blame of the injuries offered to this nobleman upon the late king; and an accommodation was effected. From the liberality of Henry IV March had acquired &s;ome e&s;tates in England, which &s;erved to indemnify his lo&s;s; and Douglas re&s;tored his Scoti&s;h domains, upon condition however of retaining the lord&s;hip of Annandale, and its ca&s;tle of Lochmaben <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 444.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A &s;cene, it is believed, before unknown in Scotland di&s;graces the annals of this year. James Re&s;by, an Engli&s;h prie&s;t of the &s;chool of Wickliffe, was condemned for here&s;y by a clerical council, pre&s;ided by Lawrence Lindoris, an inqui&s;itor; and delivered to the &s;ecular arm, and to the flames, at Perth.
<PB N="89" REF="104">The articles of his here&s;y amounted to about forty; and the fir&s;t and chief was that the Pope is not the vicar of Chri&s;t <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 441&mdash;443.</NOTE>. Winton particularly prai&s;es Albany for his aver&s;ion to Lollards, and to here&s;y, and for his devotion to the catholic church: and from this incident the reputation appears to have been well founded. But it did little honour to his government to in&s;titute the fir&s;t example to his country of fanatic cruelty, though much of the blame mu&s;t re&s;t upon prie&s;tly per&s;ecution, upon the examples of other countries and, the &s;pirit of the times. The &s;acred light of philo&s;ophy, which e&s;tabli&s;hes ab|&s;olute right of con&s;cience, and unlimited &s;cope of opinion, was yet far from its dawn; and the barbari&s;m of the age thought to honour religion by crime, and the Deity by the de&s;truction of man.</P>
<P>The truces, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1409</NOTE> which had extended from the commencement of the regency to this time, having expired without renewal, &s;ome of the commons of Tividale, a people hardened by their limitory &s;ituation, and con&s;tant expo&s;ure to war, a&s;&s;aulted and took the ca&s;tle of Jedburgh, which had remained in the hands of the Engli&s;h &s;ince the battle of Durham <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 444. Be&s;ides Berwick and Roxburgh, Fa&s;tca&s;tle was al&s;o in the hands of the Engli&s;h, as appears from different letters. Ve&s;p. F. VII, p. 97, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The walls were &s;o hardly cemented together, that much labour was required to de&s;troy them, as was re&s;olved, in order to prevent the foe from regaining &s;o firm a hold: and it was agitated in a parlia|ment, held at Perth, that a tax of two pennies upon every hearth &s;hould be rai&s;ed for this purpo&s;e. But the regent, anxious for popularity, oppo&s;ed this re&s;olution, &s;aying that during his regency no tax had ever been levied, nor &s;hould he now begin to merit by that abu&s;e the malediction of the poor: and he accordingly ordered the expence to be defrayed out of
<PB N="90" REF="105">the royal cu&s;toms <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 444.</NOTE>. One of the incon&s;i&s;tencies of human affairs is, that a power irregularly or criminally acquired is often exerted in a manner far more excellent, than the ju&s;t tenor of authority; for the latter re&s;ts upon an indi&s;pen&s;able claim, while the former requires &s;upport from the affections of the people.</P>
<P>To revenge the lo&s;s of Jedburgh, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1410</NOTE> Robert Umfraville, of the Engli&s;h family which claimed the title of Angus, entered the Forth with ten &s;hips, and took fourteen ve&s;&s;els laden with drapery and grain: and afterwards ravaged various parts of the Scoti&s;h coa&s;t. The &s;upply of corn which he brought on his return, was &s;o &s;ea&s;onable to England, then afflicted with a &s;carcity, that he was honoured with the vulgar appellation of Robert Mendmarket <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Harding, c. 207.</NOTE>. But it is uncertain whether the corn captured in the Forth was an import into, or an export from Scotland. Nor were the Scots deficient in &s;ucce&s;&s;ful ho&s;tility, for Patrick Dunbar, the &s;on of March, took by &s;tratagem the fortre&s;s of Fa&s;tca&s;tle, on the northern &s;hore of the Mer&s;e, which had been for a &s;hort time in the Engli&s;h power <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 444.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Although Henry IV was irritated by the lo&s;s of Jedburgh, and meditated a blow again&s;t the regent, yet to cover his de&s;igns he permitted a propo&s;ed truce to proceed &s;o far, as to require Albany's ratification <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The truce it&s;elf may be &s;een in Ve&s;p.

On the 21 Jan. 1410, Henry gave in&s;tructions to Emond Bugge, &s;quire of the chamber, as envoy to Albany, in|&s;i&s;ting on the return of Douglas to England, offering Murdac of Fife for a ran&s;om of 50,000 marks, or if a long peace were granted his free deliverance. Albany herald, had moved the marriage of prince John of Lanca&s;ter with the regent's daughter; but his in&s;tructions were doubted, and if right Henry will deliberate on the bu&s;ine&s;s. Ve&s;p. F.

As Henry's title to his crown was not &s;o good as Albany's to the Scoti&s;h, and a con|&s;iderable &s;imilarity occurs in the progre&s;s of their ambition, it is no wonder that &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions &s;eemed to imply pride, or reproach.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t important event during this regency now ari&s;es in the rebellion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1411</NOTE> as it was termed, of the lord of the I&s;les. The &s;ubject of di&s;pute was the earldom of Ro&s;s, a title of uncertain creation, but which at lea&s;t a&s;cends to the twelfth century. The ancient line failed in Euphemia Ro&s;s, wedded to Walter Le&s;ley, who&s;e i&s;&s;ue were Alexander Earl of Ro&s;s, and a daughter e&s;pou&s;ed to Donald lord of the I&s;les: Euphemia, upon Le&s;ley's death, married Alexander Earl of Buchan, &s;on of Robert II. Alexander Earl of Ro&s;s had by his wife, a daughter of Albany, an only child al&s;o named Euphemia, who became a nun, probably by the in&s;tigation of her mother's family, and with the intention of re&s;igning the dignity to John Earl of Buchan, &s;econd &s;on of the regent, when &s;he came of age; but the re&s;ignation was not executed till four years after this period <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Sir D.

As Euphemia by entering into a nunnery was regarded as dead in law, Donald lord of the I&s;les re&s;olved to defeat the machinations of the family of Albany, by an im|mediate &s;eizure of the earldom, which included the i&s;land of Sky, and lay contiguous to his dominions. Not contented with this acqui&s;ition, to &s;hew his &s;corn of the regent, and recommend his alliance to the Engli&s;h king, Donald rai&s;ed an army of ten thou&s;and men of the Hebudes, and of Ro&s;s, and advanced as far as Mar in his de&s;olating inroad, intending to

<P>To &s;top his de&s;tructive career, Alexander Stuart Earl of Mar, and Ogilby &s;heriff of Angus, ha&s;tily collected &s;ome troops from Buchan, Mar, Garioch, Angus, and Merns; and met the invader at Harlaw, <NOTE PLACE="marg">24 July</NOTE> about ten miles northwe&s;t of Aberdeen. Mar's army was inferior in number; and the battle was ob&s;tinate and fierce, but indeci&s;ive. On the &s;ide of Donald the chiefs of Maclean and Macinto&s;h fell, with about nine hundred; and Mar lo&s;t five hundred men, among whom were &s;ome of rank, as Scrymger con&s;table of Dundee, George Ogilby heir of the family, and mo&s;t of the gentlemen of Buchan <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 445.

<P><PB N="93" REF="108">Meantime it appears not that Henry IV made any exertion to a&s;&s;i&s;t his ally, a greater field having opened to his ambition in the affairs of France, the long di&s;&s;en&s;ions of which kingdom had now ripened into civil war. Henry prepared the future conque&s;ts of his &s;on by engaging in the party of Burgundy, to whom he this year &s;ent a &s;upply of troops: and it became an object of his prudence to prevent any di&s;turbance of his de&s;igns, by terminating ho&s;tilities with Scotland. The publication of a remarkable papal bull, given by Urban V in 1368, but not openly current till now, al&s;o contributed to this end <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Abercr. II, 240.</NOTE>. In this pontifical mandate it is forbidden, under pain of excom|munication and interdiction, to all per&s;ons eccle&s;ia&s;tical or &s;ecular, of whatever rank, to form any leagues again&s;t the government of Scotland, or to enter that kingdom ho&s;tilely, or make any depredations in it, or even to protect or a&s;&s;i&s;t any who &s;hall infringe this prohibition. To the terrors of excom|munication other penalties are added; and infamy, degradation, incapacity of any places of honour or tru&s;t, are held out to the violators; and, if kings, their &s;ubjects are ab&s;olved from their allegiance. This la&s;t threat may have had &s;ome influence with Henry, who&s;e title little required any additional &s;hock. Urban V was a Frenchman, and warm in the intere&s;ts of his country, &s;truggling at the period of this bull with Edward III: the origin of this fulmination is therefore ea&s;ily explained; and it appears to have lain dormant at fir&s;t from a di&s;covery of the friendly di&s;po&s;itions of David II towards England; and, afterwards neglected and forgotten, to have been revived by accident at the pre&s;ent epoch.</P>

<P>To add to the dome&s;tic calamities of Scotland under the feeble regency of Murdac, that country was afflicted with a new and wide malady, proceeding from irregular &s;ea&s;ons.

Among the per&s;ons of note were Henry Sinclair earl of Orkney, James Douglas lord of Dalkeith; and George Dunbar earl of March, a nobleman mo&s;t fortunate in war, the &s;ide upon which he &s;tood being always victorious, as in the battles of Otterburn, Ni&s;bet, Homildon, Shrew&s;bury, Benrig, and other le&s;s important conflicts <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 460, who adds that the di&s;ea&s;e was called the <HI>Quhew.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

Mar becomes "man of &s;palen, duelling, and revenew," to Murdac, excepting allegiance to the king: and Murdac grants him part of the profits of ju&s;ticiary, of Aberdeen, Bamf, and Inverne&s;s; and his natural &s;on Thomas is confirmed in the rever&s;ion of Mar and Garioch.

His own &s;ons, in&s;tead of being awed by the important office of their father, &s;eemed to &s;hare his dignity for the &s;ake of licence, and to regard his authority as a protection for their vices. There is a tradition, the &s;implicity of which &s;eems to &s;peak its truth, that the regent had a favorite falcon, which his &s;on Walter had often reque&s;ted un&s;ucce&s;sfully, and at la&s;t, vexed with repeated refu&s;al, he tore it from his father's hand, and twi&s;ted its neck: upon which Murdac mildly exclaimed, "Since you pay me &s;o little re&s;pect, I mu&s;t invite him whom both mu&s;t obey <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Boyce, f. v. 358.

But before proceeding to his memorable and &s;pirited reign, it will be proper briefly to re|view the deeds and fate of the Scots in France.</P>
<P>The year after the arrival of the Scoti&s;h auxiliaries, we find Henry V u&s;ing the company of James, his captive, as a mean of preventing the ho&s;tilities of his &s;ubjects; but without effect, for they continued to &s;erve the Dauphin, ju&s;tly regarding their &s;overeign's will as ineffectual while under con&s;traint. The fir&s;t important action in which the Scots appear is the battle of Baug&eacute;, &s;o called from a village in Anjou, twenty two miles to the ea&s;t of Angers. The Dauphin had appointed the Scots, led by the earls of Buchan and Wigton, and Stuart of Darnley, to guard that province again&s;t the Duke of Clarence, whom Henry V had detached for its reduction. On the twenty &s;econd day of March, 1421, the Engli&s;h when foraging took four Scots, and brought them to Clarence, who thus learned that the Scoti&s;h army and a few French lay at Baug&eacute;. The Duke in&s;tantly &s;prung from the table exclaiming, "Let us attack them, they are ours: but let none follow &s;ave the men at arms:" and after a quick march he came to Little Baug&eacute;, where a few French defended the church, and gained time for Buchan to arrange his troops. The Engli&s;h aware of this left the church untaken, and advanced; but to a complete de|feat. Clarence, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a coronet of gold and jewels upon his helmet, was the fir&s;t &s;lain; and a &s;imilar fate awaited the Earl of Kent, the Lords Grey and Ro&s;s, and above four|teen hundred men at arms. The Earls of Huntingdon and Somer&s;et, and many others of note, were made captives. To
<PB N="105" REF="120">reward the Earl of Buchan, who had &s;lain Clarence with his own hand, the Dauphin gave him the high di&s;tinction of Con&s;table of France <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Des Ur&s;ins, 389.

<P>Bowar, 459, 460, has curious details. Clarence, after having been pierced with a &s;pear by Sir William Swinton, was &s;lain by Buchan with a battle-ax. The brothers of the future queen of Scotland were taken pri&s;oners by the Scots. On hearing the tidings, the pontiff Martin V &s;aid ludicrou&s;ly, "In truth the Scots are the only antidote of the Engli&s;h."</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the following year the Con&s;table took Avranches in Normandy; and probably learning the agreement which his father-in-law the Earl of Douglas had made with Henry V, he re&s;olved to detach him from the Engli&s;h intere&s;t. For which purpo&s;e he vi&s;ited Scotland, empowered to offer the earl the duchy of Touraine; and Douglas con&s;ented to bring five thou&s;and men into France. The Dauphin, now Charles VII, rewarded Stuart of Darnley with the lord&s;hip of Aubigny in Berry; and the family and title were to become not a little illu&s;trious. The death of Henry V had checked the Engli&s;h exertions; and Buchan and Douglas were only ordered to de|fend the Loire, and prevent the foe from entering Berry <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 463.

<P>But fortune now became adver&s;e to the Scoti&s;h auxiliaries; and two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive defeats almo&s;t extingui&s;hed them. The fir&s;t happened at Crevan in Burgundy, in the year 1423.
<PB N="106" REF="121">Charles VII intended that the Scots &s;hould proceed to Cham|pagne, and defend that country again&s;t Sali&s;bury; but Aubigny laid &s;iege to Crevan, and &s;ent for cannon, which were refu&s;ed as he neglected his orders. Sali&s;bury advanced to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and an action en&s;ued in which the Scots were defeated: Stuart of Darnley and Aubigny, con&s;table of the Scoti&s;h army, was taken pri&s;oner; and &s;oon after exchanged for the mar&s;hal of Burgundy: Sir William Hamilton, and about nine hundred, were left on the field <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Jean Chartier, 4, Berry, 53, Hall, f. v. 86, Mon&s;trelet, II, 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The other defeat, which may be regarded as final, happened in the fir&s;t year of James; but the connexion renders its de|&s;cription proper at this place. This was the memorable battle of Verne&uuml;il in Normandy, fought on the &s;eventeenth of Augu&s;t, 1424. The archbi&s;hop of Rheims had been &s;ent emba&s;&s;ador to Scotland, to procure a reinforcement, which landed in Bretagne; and Douglas, now Duke of Touraine, advanced to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Yvry undertaken by the Engli&s;h. But the French king learning that a battle mu&s;t be ri&s;qued, before the place was relieved, a&s;&s;embled all his troops, and leaving Tours, with Buchan the con&s;table, he met his barons at Chateaudun and advanced to Verne&uuml;il. Bedford upon this rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Yvry, and marched to meet the French and Scots. Arriving near Verne&uuml;il, he &s;ent a herald to Douglas, who had in deri&s;ion called him John with the leaden &s;word, informing him that he had come to drink with him, and that
<PB N="107" REF="122">he would wait till he had that honour. The Duke of Touraine an&s;wered that he was mo&s;t welcome; that he had come from Scotland to find him, and he begged him to come quickly. If in the&s;e minute matters the manner of Plutarch be imitated, it is becau&s;e it intere&s;ts, and paints men and manners. The battalions were &s;oon arranged upon either &s;ide, and Douglas re&s;olved not to lo&s;e an advantageous &s;tation, but to await the Engli&s;h: the Vicomte of Narbonne, the French general, unhappily thought otherwi&s;e, and proceeded with the national ra&s;hne&s;s which had decided the battles of Cre&s;&s;y, Poitiers, Azincour. Douglas was forced to follow the example; and the army lo&s;t breath, rank, and &s;tation, while the enemy re|tained all. The French &s;ent two thou&s;and to attack the rear of the foe; but they were defeated by the Engli&s;h archers, and a general rout en&s;ued. The Duke of Touraine, and his &s;on-in-law the con&s;table of France, and mo&s;t of the Scoti&s;h|men of note were &s;lain: and of the French the Vicomte de Narbonne, the Count D'Aumale, and many other nobles: of common French and Scots fell about four thou&s;and five hun|dred.

<P>AFTER two weak and inactive reigns, and two regencies of no &s;uperior character, a monarch is to &s;ucceed, who&s;e government is to be di&s;tingui&s;hed for its novelty and vigour; and the hou&s;e of Stuart is at la&s;t to know a &s;overeign. James had now attained his thirtieth year; and his prime of life was yet further recommended by every advantage, which natural talents, and a complete education, could be&s;tow. In per&s;on he was rather under the middle &s;ize, but endued with &s;uch firmne&s;s and agility as to excell in every manly exerci&s;e. In wre&s;tling, in the management of the bow, or the &s;pear, in throwing the quoit, in running, in hor&s;eman&s;hip, he yielded to none. But his mental abilities were yet more con&s;picuous.
<PB N="109" REF="124">A man of &s;cience and learning, an excellent poet, a ma&s;ter of mu&s;ic, the fame of his accompli&s;hments reflected glory even on the throne. Illu&s;trious in every per&s;onal virtue, free from any per&s;onal vice, his very amu&s;ements adorned his character; his hours of lei&s;ure being frequently dedicated to elegant writing, and miniature painting, to mechanical arts, and to the cultivation of the garden and the orchard <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Bowar, II, 504, &s;eq Mair, 309.

<P>The features of his government it is more difficult to di&s;|criminate. If we believe &s;ome writers, not le&s;s than three thou&s;and men were put to death, in the two fir&s;t years of his reign; and after the inroad of Donald Balloch, three hundred highland banditti met with the &s;ame fate <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Abercr. II, 311, from Hector Boyce, f. 361, a fit authority!</NOTE>. Happily the&s;e matters are quite unknown to contemporary and authentic monuments of our hi&s;tory: the ju&s;tice of James fell only on a few nobles, and &s;ome chiefs of clans; but the numerous de|pendants of tho&s;e victims of equitable &s;everity embraced every occa&s;ion to excite di&s;contents, and propagate fal&s;ehoods again&s;t the government, fal&s;ehoods which have even pa&s;t into the page of hi&s;tory, for one of the misfortunes of the hou&s;e of Stuart has con&s;i&s;ted in the prejudices of &s;everal Scoti&s;h hi&s;torians. If any blame mu&s;t fall, let it fall where it ought, upon the mi&s;|rule of the hou&s;e of Albany. To a people who had lived for half a century under a loo&s;e and delegated government, and who had been accu&s;tomed to regard licence as liberty, it is no wonder that the puni&s;hment of crimes &s;eemed quite a new and &s;trange cruelty: that a &s;alutary &s;trength of government ap|peared
<PB N="110" REF="125">de&s;poti&s;m: that a nece&s;&s;ary and legal taxation a&s;&s;umed the &s;hape of tyrannic extortion. The commons, led by the nobles, ab&s;urdly regarded the cau&s;e of the latter as their own, and &s;aw not that the king in cru&s;hing the ari&s;tocracy was doing the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to his people. The plans of James were &s;agacious and profound, but &s;ometimes incur the charge of temerity; and while they partake of the greatne&s;s of genius, they are limited by the want of a &s;ufficient power in the Scoti&s;h monarchy for their complete execution. In a word James is fully entitled to the uncommon character of a great &s;overeign, in the arts of government and of peace <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 511, records and apophthegm of James, when he was informed on entering his kingdom, that the regencies had left it a &s;oene of fraud and rapine, "By the help of God, though I &s;hould my&s;elf lead the life of a dog, I &s;hall make the key keep the ca&s;tle, and the bu&s;h &s;ecure the cow."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Upon entering his kingdom, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ea&s;ter 23 Apr.</NOTE> James proceeded to Edinburgh, were he keeped the fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter; and afterwards ad|vancing to Scone, <NOTE PLACE="marg">21 May</NOTE> was there &s;olemnly crowned with his queen; Murdac duke of Albany, as earl of Fife, performing the cere|mony of placing his &s;overeign in the throne <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 474.</NOTE>. A truce of &s;even years having been previou&s;ly formed with England <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Rymer, X, 328, 332.</NOTE>, James had full lei&s;ure and opportunity to attend to the internal &s;tate of his kingdom; <NOTE PLACE="marg">26 May</NOTE> and a parliament commenced at Perth five days after his coronation <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Acts, edit. 1566, (commonly called the Black Acts, becau&s;e printed in black letter,) fol. 2.</NOTE>. With the acts of this parlia|ment begins the regular &s;eries of Scoti&s;h laws, and a new light ari&s;es upon a mo&s;t important province of hi&s;tory, that of go|vernment and manners. The reiterated theme of battles, and negotiations, may now be diver&s;ified with more intere&s;ting intelligence, and the arts of peace may afford a plea&s;ing contra&s;t to the deva&s;tations of war. In this national council it was
<PB N="111" REF="126">decreed that the antient privileges and freedom of the church be confirmed: that the king's peace be firmly held, and no private wars allowed: that no man &s;hould travel with more followers than he could maintain <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 2, c. 5.</NOTE>: that efficient admini&s;trators of law be appointed through all the realm: that no extortions from churchmen, or farmers, in particular be admitted: that the cu&s;toms and borough rates be a&s;&s;igned to the king, and mines of gold and &s;ilver under certain re&s;trictions: that the clergy &s;hall not pa&s;s the &s;ea without the king's permi&s;&s;ion, nor have pen&s;ions out of benefices in Scotland: that gold and &s;ilver &s;hould not be exported but upon paying a high cu&s;tom: that all per&s;ons exceeding twelve years of age &s;hould be taught archery: that agriculture be protected by the de&s;truction of rooks, and by a prevention from &s;etting fire to heathy ground while the corn was &s;tanding: that certain cu&s;toms be rai&s;ed on hor&s;e, cattle, and &s;heep, and herrings, and on furs: that inns be kept in every borough; and no beggars allowed, except permitted by the &s;heriff in the country, and in towns by the aldermen or bailies <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ib. f. v. 2, f. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such were the &s;alutary regulations of this parliament, many of them be&s;peaking political prudence, and others an amiable &s;implicity of manners. But there were two others of remark|able import, and therefore re&s;erved for a &s;eparate con&s;ideration. The fir&s;t orders the &s;heriffs to enquire what lands belonged to the crown, under the preceding monarchs David II, and the two la&s;t Roberts, declaring at the &s;ame time that the king may &s;ummon the holders to &s;hew their charters <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ib. f. v. 2.</NOTE>. The &s;econd impo&s;es a large &s;ub&s;idy, in order to defray the &s;um payable to England for the king's maintenance <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ib. f. 3. See Appendix.</NOTE>. Though the ju&s;tice of
<PB N="112" REF="127">the&s;e ordinances cannot be que&s;tioned, yet their policy may. The former, it is believed, produced no effect, except &s;u&s;pi|cion, and di&s;content, among a number of the &s;ubjects: and the latter excited an almo&s;t univer&s;al di&s;&s;atisfaction. Though a &s;ub&s;idy to defray the king's ran&s;om, if taken pri&s;oner, was one of the few taxes authorized by the feudal &s;y&s;tem, yet the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances did not, to the public mind, ju&s;tify the impo&s;ition. The tax con&s;i&s;ted of twelve pennies in the pound of all &s;orts of production, farms, and annual rents, cattle and grain, whether of the clergy, or of the laity, and to continue for two years. Auditors, or chief receivers, were appointed, who in the fir&s;t year collected about fourteen thou&s;and marks; but in the &s;econd year the popular expo&s;tulations increa&s;ed and prevailed <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 482, him&s;elf one of the auditors.</NOTE>. The con&s;equence was, that the &s;um payable for the king's maintenance in England was never defrayed.</P>
<P>It was not to be expected that the u&s;urpations of the family of Albany &s;hould pa&s;s unrevenged; <NOTE PLACE="marg">1425</NOTE> and James was no &s;ooner firm on the throne of his ance&s;tors than he thought of di&s;|charging this great duty in a &s;pirited manner. As their power had continued for a long time, and was deeply rooted in the nation, it was nece&s;&s;ary to try the public pul&s;e, an proceed by degrees. Accordingly, in the very commencement of his exerci&s;e of authority, James had ordered Walter, the elde&s;t &s;on of the late regent Murdac, into cu&s;tody; and at the &s;ame time, probably only to veil his de&s;igns, and prevent the family of Albany from being regarded as the &s;ole objects of his re&s;ent|ment, Malcom Fleming of Cumbernald, and Thomas Boyd of Kilmarnoc, &s;hared the &s;ame fate, but were &s;oon after re|lea&s;ed <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 481, dates this impri&s;onment on the 13th May 1424, before the king's coronation.</NOTE>. The next objects of impri&s;onment were Duncan
<PB N="113" REF="128">earl of Lennox, father in law to Murdac, and Sir Robert Graham <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 482. This Sir Robert Graham was the &s;ame who afterwards a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated James. Buch. X, 28.</NOTE>. At length the public inclination being &s;ufficiently&punc; explored, James ventured on a mo&s;t daring expedient; and &s;ummoning a parliament to Perth he gave orders to arre&s;t at once Murdac duke of Albany, <NOTE PLACE="marg">12 Mar.</NOTE> and Alexander Stuart his &s;econd &s;on, with the earls of Douglas, Angus, March, and not le&s;s than twenty gentlemen of great ance&s;try and power <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. As it is certain that the revenge only extended to the hou&s;e of Al|bany, and was meant to proceed no further, hi&s;torians find &s;ome difficulty in accounting for the pretext or motive to this large exertion of authority. The pretext might perhaps be, that the pri&s;oners had not complied with the late act of parlia|ment in producing their charters; and as mo&s;t of them, if not all, had been warm &s;upporters of the family of Albany, the motive appears more certainly to have been the prevention of any in&s;urrection in favour of that hou&s;e. In&s;tantly upon the &s;eizure of Albany, the king took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ca&s;tles of Falkland in Fife, and Down in Menteith: Murdac was committed to Carlaveroc ca&s;tle, and I&s;abella his duche&s;s to Tantallon, places remote from the &s;eat of their feudal influ|ence <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 483.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That the precaution u&s;ed by James, in &s;ecuring the friends of Albany, was not vain, may appear from the conduct of James Stuart, the younge&s;t &s;on of the duke. Having e&s;caped his intended arre&s;t, he, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Finlay bi&s;hop of Li&s;more or Argyle, rai&s;ed a band of Highland freebooters, a&s;&s;aulted and burned the town of Dunbarton, <NOTE PLACE="marg">3 May</NOTE> and put to the &s;word Sir John Stuart of Dundonald, uncle to the king, with thirty two men. The monarch, ju&s;tly enraged at this in&s;ult,
<PB N="114" REF="129">ordered the &s;on of Albany to be proclaimed a felon; and &s;o hot was the pur&s;uit that he was forced, with the bi&s;hop and other accomplices, to &s;eek refuge in Ireland, whence they never returned. Five of his band being taken in a few days, &s;uffered the mo&s;t ignominious and extreme puni&s;hment of the law <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 483.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>After a delay of two months nece&s;&s;ary to collect &s;ufficient proofs of Albany's guilt, and to prepare the minds of the people, <NOTE PLACE="marg">18 May</NOTE> James adjourned the parliament to Stirling, and this important trial was in&s;tituted. The jury con&s;i&s;ted of twenty one members of parliament, all of whom, as forming only one hou&s;e, were in Scotland regarded as peers <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Home, lord Kaims, Hi&s;t. Law Tracts, 272.</NOTE>. The judge was the king him&s;elf, fitting on the throne of ju&s;tice, with all the pomp of royalty; and this u&s;ual practice of the monarch pre&s;iding in his own cau&s;e may be vindicated from the ancient ideas concerning a jury, who were e&s;teemed arbitrators of fact and of law, the judge being only the organ of their verdict. It is remarkable that among the jury we find Walter Stuart earl of Athole, Archibald earl of Douglas, William earl of Angus, George earl of March, and three gentlemen who had been arre&s;ted with Albany <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 483.</NOTE>. As by the Scoti&s;h law a majority was &s;ufficient to condemn a pri&s;oner, this jury &s;eems to have been artfully managed, in order to remove any &s;u&s;picion from the king, and to throw the &s;everity of the verdict upon Albany's own adherents. Walter the regent's elde&s;t &s;on was fir&s;t tried, found guilty, <NOTE PLACE="marg">24 May</NOTE> and in&s;tantly beheaded; any delay &s;erving no purpo&s;e in &s;uch a ca&s;e but to create danger.

<P>It mu&s;t not be omitted that, in the &s;econd parliament of this reign, held at Perth as above mentioned, &s;everal prudent laws were pa&s;&s;ed, for the more effectual puni&s;hment of tho&s;e who infringed the acts of the national council <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 6.</NOTE>: for preventing any leagues among the &s;ubjects, an edict evidently pointing to the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of Albany's adherents; as does another, puni&s;hing the receivers of rebels by forfeiture, and another noted &s;tatute condemning to death and confi&s;cation all guilty of propagating fal&s;ehoods between the king and the people.

<P>While James was celebrating the anniver&s;ary of his birth at St. Andrews, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug.</NOTE> attended by Douglas, Mar, Murray, Angus, and other nobles, he gave audience to the Flemi&s;h emba&s;&s;adors who had been deputed to &s;ettle &s;ome commercial differences. The Scoti&s;h merchants had, during the regencies, been treated with great arrogance, nay even letters of marque had been i&s;&s;ued again&s;t them, in Flanders, which, with the duke of Burgundy, &s;u&s;tained the Engli&s;h party again&s;t France. James had in con&s;equence ordered the Scoti&s;h trade to be transferred to Middleburg in Zealand; but upon the offer of compen&s;ation, and enlarged privileges, by the emba&s;&s;adors, the commerce was re&s;tored to Flanders <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 487.</NOTE>. As Venice was the grand &s;eat of trade between A&s;ia and Europe, &s;o Bruges in Flanders was the commercial link, which connected the merchandize of Venice, and the &s;outh of Europe, with its northern countries. Mo&s;t articles of manufacture being al&s;o imported from Flanders by the Scots, who were yet little ver&s;ed in the arts of indu&s;try, it is no wonder that the Flemi&s;h were eager to retain a com|merce,
<PB N="117" REF="132">which was one great cau&s;e of impoveri&s;hing Scotland, and contributed not a little to the riches of Flanders.</P>
<P>It is with much complacency that this narration now pro|ceeds with the hi&s;tory of peace, for which ample materials begin with this reign to be found in Scotland. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1426 11 Mar.</NOTE> In a third parliament, it was ordered that all merchants &s;hould import &s;ome armour, and arms, with their cargoes <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 8.</NOTE>: that all the lieges &s;hould be governed by the laws of the realm, and not by particular laws, or privileges, or by the laws of other countries: that no man, who had accu&s;ed another, &s;hould be of the jury on his trial: that the prelates, earls, barons, and freeholders of the king, &s;hould appear per&s;onally in parliament, and not by procurators, except on lawful cau&s;e: that the books of the law be examined, and reformed: that to &s;upport the inns, travellers &s;hould lodge in them, and not with friends: that none &s;hould pa&s;s into Ireland without licence, as the rebels had been there received, nor &s;hould the Iri&s;h come to Scotland as they might be &s;pies for the Engli&s;h: that a court of &s;e&s;&s;ion be in&s;tituted, the chancellor, and certain di&s;creet per&s;ons of the three e&s;tates, to &s;it thrice a year, for a period of time, and hear all cau&s;es: that they who have nothing &s;hall labour for their living: that the acts of parliament be regi&s;tered, and copies given to prelates, barons, and burge&s;&s;es, at their expence <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. v.

This la&s;t act was particularly nece&s;&s;ary, in order to render the parliamentary in&s;titutions known, and practical: and after all it is recorded, as an apophthegm of Buchanan, that in Scotland one great act of parliament was wanted, namely a decree to enjoin the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the others. For a chief part of government, though unob&s;erved by politicians, re&s;ts in the &s;pirit of the people: laws are vain
<PB N="118" REF="133">without manners: and a nation, accu&s;tomed to loo&s;e mi&s;rule, regards even law as a part of its licence, as a &s;ermon and not as a duty, as a &s;plendid theory and not as &s;olid practice. In a &s;pecial a&s;&s;ize of this parliament, regulations were introduced into weights and mea&s;ures, and provi&s;ions were made again&s;t the fatal effects of dome&s;tic fire <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 12.

The frequent a&s;&s;embling of the national council does great honour to James, for mo|narchs inclined to de&s;poti&s;m have ever trembled to meet the repre&s;entatives of their people; and the acts reflect prai&s;e on the patrioti&s;m and the wi&s;dom of the in&s;titutors.</P>

The Lords of the
<PB N="119" REF="134">I&s;les in particular, by their con&s;tant confederacy with England, and repeated inroads, well de&s;erved a &s;ignal cha&s;ti&s;ement. In pur&s;uance of the&s;e motives, certainly ju&s;t and laudable, the king a&s;&s;embled a parliament at Inverne&s;s in the &s;pring, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1427</NOTE> which the highland chieftains were &s;pecially &s;ummoned to attend; and &s;uddenly arre&s;ted Alexander Lord of the I&s;les, and his mother the Counte&s;s of Ro&s;s, Angus Duff leader of four thou&s;and Mackays of Strathnavern, Kenneth More chief of two thou&s;and, John Ro&s;s, William Le&s;ley, Angus Moray, and Macmaken, each al&s;o a chief of two thou&s;and; and in &s;hort about fifty principal heads of lawle&s;s clans. Two of them, leaders of a thou&s;and each, were in&s;tantly tried, condemned, and beheaded; and one, who had murdered the late Lord of the I&s;les, was al&s;o executed in impartial ju&s;tice. The others were &s;cattered, as pri&s;oners, among the ca&s;tles of different lords through the kingdom; and after a time &s;ome were con|demned to death, and &s;ome were re&s;tored to liberty. The Lord of the I&s;les and his mother were retained in captivity till, apparently after a year or more, the former was delivered, while the latter &s;eems in vain to have been retained as an ho&s;tage for his fidelity <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 488, 489. She was daughter, and heire&s;s, of Sir Walter Le&s;ley, who, with his brother Norman, took Alexandria in the time of David II, and had a French title. Ib.</NOTE>. Such were the proceedings upon this occa&s;ion, which by &s;ome have been termed &s;anguinary; but, if nece&s;&s;ity be the tyrant's plea, it is al&s;o that of law and of ju&s;tice. Lenient and conciliatory mea&s;ures would have had the &s;ame effect as mu&s;ic upon the deaf, and could have &s;erved no end but to increa&s;e the pride of the&s;e chieftains, and to deba&s;e the laws and the monarchy. Perhaps it might however have proved more political if James, upon the capture of the
<PB N="120" REF="135">chiefs, had in&s;i&s;ted upon receiving their &s;ons, or neare&s;t rela|tions, as ho&s;tages; and thus not only have had pledges for their good behaviour, but al&s;o an opportunity of contributing to civilize the highlands by be&s;towing on the future chiefs a proper education: a conduct which might have pa&s;&s;ed into a perpetual rule. But in the choice of difficulties it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eize the exact mean; and if equity enforce the acknowledgement that James was apt to do too much, and too little, the peculiarities of the country, and of the time, mu&s;t come in for a &s;hare of the blame.</P>
<P>It was ordered in a parliament, held at Perth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 July</NOTE> that tho&s;e burge&s;&s;es who were &s;ummoned to parliament, and were ab&s;ent without lawful cau&s;e, &s;hould be fined in ten pounds each: that the law&s;uits of Scoti&s;h merchants in Zealand, Flanders, or other foreign countries, be decided in Scotland: and &s;everal acts appear for the puni&s;hment of murder and felony <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 15&mdash;17.

<P>Some trifling negotiations had taken place in the preceding year with England, now governed by the duke of Gloce&s;ter and cardinal Beaufort; but James, though indebted to that kingdom for an education excellent and truly royal, to which, and to the &s;chool of adver&s;ity, he owed the expan&s;ion of his talents, had yet no rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the genero&s;ity, or the friend&s;hip, of the Engli&s;h court <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Rymer, X, 376, erroneou&s;ly a&s;cribes a commi&s;&s;ion of James IV to the bi&s;hop of Moray, for a per&s;onal conference with Henry VII, to this year; mi&s;taking the 22d of James IV, 1509, for the 22d of James I, 1427.

Henry VI was only &s;ix year of age.</NOTE>. The Scoti&s;h mo|narch was therefore well inclined to follow the former tide of politics towards France, who&s;e king Charles VII was &s;till in a mo&s;t reduced &s;ituation, and nearly overwhelmed by the power of England and Burgundy. Re&s;olved by every con|ce&s;&s;ion to procure the aid of Scotland, Charles di&s;patched the Archbi&s;hop of Rheims, and John Stuart, Count de Dreux and Lord of Darnley <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aubigny</HI> was now in abeyance?</NOTE>, for that purpo&s;e. In con&s;equence of their in&s;tructions, the emba&s;&s;adors offered to conclude a contract of marriage between Louis the Dauphin, afterwards Louis XI, and Margaret the elde&s;t daughter of Scotland, both then in|fants, upon condition, that James &s;hould &s;end &s;ix thou&s;and effective men to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Charles, being the only dower required. The prince&s;s was neverthele&s;s provided in an in|come, and contingencies, as ample and honourable as had been ever granted, upon any royal marriage of France. Such terms could not be refu&s;ed; and the contract was &s;igned and ratified. Nay, the two monarchs mutually &s;wore to ob&s;erve the former
<PB N="122" REF="137">alliances, entered into between their kingdoms: and Charles a&s;&s;igned to the Scoti&s;h king the county of Xaintonge, and Lord|&s;hip of Rochfort <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">MS.

<P>The government of England was rather alarmed at this new connexion between Scotland and France, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1429</NOTE> and an interview was propo&s;ed between James and cardinal Beaufort: the king was to be attended by a thou&s;and hor&s;e, <NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Feb.</NOTE> and the cardinal ob|tained permi&s;&s;ion from the Engli&s;h court to meet him either on the borders, or in Scotland <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Rymer, X, 410.

<P>The Lord of the I&s;les, who had been at la&s;t &s;et at liberty, after many admonitions and injunctions of fidelity, &s;oon in|dulged his revenge by gathering his lawle&s;s bands, and burning

<P>Several patriotic regulations were i&s;&s;ued by the parliament concerning the forms of procedure; <NOTE PLACE="marg">1430 March</NOTE> and a &s;umptuary law was

All Scoti&s;hmen, who travel to England without the king's leave, are declared traitors; and, by a re|markable decree, all barons and lords, having lands on the we&s;tern or the northern &s;eas, particularly tho&s;e oppo&s;ite to the i&s;lands, are enjoined to furni&s;h a certain number of galleys, according to the terms of their tenures <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 19&mdash;f. 22.</NOTE>.

Perhaps Douglas had been guilty of &s;ome private practices with England; or the king wi&s;hed to &s;ecure the peace of the &s;outh of Scotland, while he was employed in quelling the northern in&s;urrections, by retaining Douglas its chief leader in captivity. Conjecture wanders in &s;uch enquiry; but it is certain that Douglas remained a pri&s;oner till the end of Sep|tember this year; when the king in a parliament, held, as u&s;ual, at Perth, con&s;ented, at the reque&s;t of the queen, nobles, and prelates, to deliver both Douglas and the lord of the I&s;les <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 490.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, in &s;pite of all the endeavours of James, the highlands remained in a &s;tate of con&s;tant rebellion and &s;avage anarchy.

There is rea&s;on to believe that the Engli&s;h were &s;incere; but the honour of the king and of the nation, and the mutual intere&s;ts of France and Scotland, were motives momentous enough to cau&s;e the re|jection of even &s;uperior terms. The di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this affair ended rather ludicrou&s;ly. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct.</NOTE> A parliament being called at Perth, the propo&s;itions were agitated before the king, in the Domi|nican Church; and the nobles and prelates &s;eemed to accept the terms, &s;aying that peace and liberty were the objects of their chief de&s;ire. But the abbots of Scone and Inchcolm, fitter a&s;&s;i&s;tants at a mona&s;tic di&s;pute than at a public delibera|tion, a&s;&s;erted that the Scoti&s;h king could not treat of peace with England, becau&s;e of the confederacy with France, which
<PB N="127" REF="142">had been examined by the univer&s;ity of Paris, and confirmed by the Pope. Other objections were al&s;o &s;tarted; and the day being wa&s;ted in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, it was agreed to re&s;ume the &s;ubject on the morrow, when John Fogo, abbot of Melro&s;e, alledged, on the other &s;ide, that no per&s;on could abide by the divine laws, who depended on the will of another; and that no king could lawfully &s;wear to another that he would not make peace with a third, except by the con&s;ent of the &s;econd. Violent altercations among the clergy now aro&s;e; the parlia|ment was transformed into a hall of eccle&s;ia&s;tic di&s;putes; and as &s;uch di&s;putes never decide any thing, the members &s;eparated without determination, only the very want of deci&s;ion left the alliance with France in full force; and the Engli&s;h propo&s;itions were con&s;idered as rejected. Lindoris, the inqui&s;itor, called Fogo to account for his &s;entiments, as &s;avouring of here&s;y; and Fogo retorted by &s;everal epi&s;tles, but was at la&s;t forced to make conce&s;&s;ions <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Bowar, the abbot of Inch Colm, 499, 500.</NOTE>.

Having therefore quelled the i&s;les and highlands, which, as the mo&s;t important office, engaged his fir&s;t cares, the king re|&s;olved to complete his own power, and that of his kingdom, by removing the family of March from a territory which had been the free gift of a Scoti&s;h king to an Engli&s;h exile, and by placing that hou&s;e in a more northern and &s;ecure part of Scotland. In pur&s;uance of this ju&s;t and prudent plan, James ordered the earl of March to be confined in the ca&s;tle of Edin|burgh, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fortre&s;s of Dunbar, the chief &s;eat of the family <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 500.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A parliament being &s;ummoned, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1435 10 Jan.</NOTE> two clergymen, and &s;even commons, were appointed to hear and report all cau&s;es during
<PB N="129" REF="144">the &s;e&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Abercromby, II, 292, gives their names.</NOTE>; an in&s;titution not explained, but apparently in|tended for expediting this particular bu&s;ine&s;s, and quite di&s;tinct from the committee of lords of the articles, who are known as early as the reign of David II. The king's advocates alledged that the father of March having engaged in open re|bellion again&s;t the kingdom, it was not in the power of Robert duke of Albany the regent, to pardon him, a privilege belong|ing to the crown only; but that the e&s;tates were forfeited: and that, by the laws of Scotland, all alienations of crown-lands, to which de&s;cription the forfeited e&s;tates of March be|longed, were void, when made during the minority, or cap|tivity, of the &s;overeign.

<P>A con&s;iderable property accrued to the crown, by the death of Alexander earl of Mar, a per&s;onage repeatedly mentioned before.

<P>The dauphin of France having now attained his thirteenth year, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1436</NOTE> and the Scoti&s;h prince&s;s her twelfth, it was re&s;olved to complete the marriage. Two French envoys arrived, to be|troth the bride; and &s;he was &s;ent to France attended by a &s;mall fleet, and an honourable train, of which the chief per&s;ons were William Sinclair earl of Orkney the admiral, and John bi&s;hop of Brechin. The others amounted to &s;ixteen knights and &s;quires, and a hundred and forty young gentlemen: they were guarded
<PB N="131" REF="146">by a thou&s;and armed men, in three galleys, and &s;ix barges.

He &s;ummoned the whole array of his kingdom, computed at nearly two hundred thou&s;and men, mounted on &s;mall hor&s;es, but not entitled to the appel|lation of cavalry, and yet a greater number of rude infantry, and loo&s;e attendants on the army. With this unwieldy force he be&s;ieged Roxburgh; <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Aug.</NOTE> and after wa&s;ting fifteen days, and almo&s;t all the mi&s;&s;ive arms of the kingdom, he was forced to abandon the &s;iege, and return inglorious <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 502.

<P>Sir Robert Graham uncle of the earl of Strathern, after|wards of Menteith, had been impri&s;oned in 1425, as is above mentioned, but the cau&s;e is unknown. Two years afterwards James had re&s;umed the earldom of Strathern, upon pretext, as &s;eems, that it was confined to heirs male; and had given it to his uncle Walter earl of Athole for his life: a&s;&s;igning, in recompence, that of Menteith to Malis Graham, the former
<PB N="134" REF="149">earl of Strathern <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See the Sutherland Ca&s;e by Sir D. Dalrymple, ch. v. p. 56, 57, from the original charters.</NOTE>. Robert Graham may have been di&s;con|tented at this exchange of his nephew's dignity; but it is not ea&s;y to conceive that his wrath upon this account could have excited him to the murder of his &s;overeign, and far le&s;s that he could have wi&s;hed to &s;erve the ambition of Athole, to whom his nephew's former earldom had pa&s;&s;ed. The art of this man &s;eems to have equalled his audacity; and he mu&s;t have in|&s;tigated Athole, now approaching, if not exceeding, his &s;eventieth year <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Walter earl of Athole and Strathern, the &s;econd &s;on of Robert II by Eu|phemia Ro&s;s, mu&s;t have been born about 1367 at the late&s;t.</NOTE>, to this con&s;piracy by ambitious views, only fit to captivate the dotage of age, or inexperience of youth, and in&s;pired by Graham &s;olely to promote his own de&s;perate revenge. This idea is favoured by the following narration, which al&s;o explains the violent cau&s;es which inflamed this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in: but it would be neither a matter of paradox, nor blame, to infer that Athole, and his family, were really innocent; and that they were accu&s;ed by Graham to gratify his animo&s;ity, be|cau&s;e Athole held his nephew's e&s;tates and dignity. It &s;hall only be further premi&s;ed that Sir Robert Stuart, grand&s;on of Athole, on whom the con&s;pirators pretended to be&s;tow the crown, was the &s;on of David, elde&s;t &s;on of that earl, left an ho&s;tage in England for James, ever &s;ince his arrival in his kingdom; and who apparently died there either before this period, or &s;oon after.</P>
<P>According to this ancient relation, James had di&s;contented his nobles by his vigorous procedure again&s;t them; and they a&s;&s;erted that his avarice of confi&s;cated e&s;tates, and not his ju&s;tice, induced him to &s;uch actions. The people were al&s;o di&s;plea&s;ed becau&s;e of the &s;ub&s;idies impo&s;ed, to which they had
<PB N="135" REF="150">long been &s;trangers; and were even inclined to pronounce his government tyrannic. In this po&s;ture of affairs, and probably in the year 1434, after March had been confined, and his e&s;tates &s;eized, Sir Robert Graham, now delivered from his fir&s;t impri&s;onment, and irritated by that di&s;grace, propo&s;ed, in a meeting of the lords and chief men, that he would repre&s;ent their grievances to the king, if they would &s;upport him. As he was eloquent, and ver&s;ed in the laws, they willingly a&s;|&s;ented. Accordingly, in the next parliament, or that held for the forfeiture of March in January 1435, Graham's violence led him to exceed his commi&s;&s;ion; for he ro&s;e with an enraged countenance, and approaching the royal &s;eat, laid his hand on the king, &s;aying, "I arre&s;t you in the name of all the three e&s;tates of your realm, here a&s;&s;embled in parliament; for, as your people have &s;worn to obey you, &s;o are you con&s;trained by an equal oath to govern by law, and not to wrong your &s;ubjects, but in ju&s;tice to maintain and defend them." Then turning around, he exclaimed, "Is it not thus as I &s;ay?" But the mem|bers, &s;truck with con&s;ternation at Graham's ra&s;hne&s;s, remained in profound &s;ilence: and the king in&s;tantly ordered the auda|cious cen&s;or to pri&s;on, to which he was conveyed, after a &s;evere &s;arca&s;m on the meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, &s;hewn by tho&s;e who had promi&s;ed to &s;upport him. Soon after Graham was ordered into bani&s;hment; and all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions forfeited to the king.</P>
<P>The bold and gloomy exile retired into the furthe&s;t high|lands, meditating revenge: and he had even the audacity formally to renounce his allegiance, and to &s;end a defiance to the king in writing, a&s;&s;erting that James had ruined him, his wife, and children, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, by his cruel tyranny; and that he &s;hould kill his &s;overeign with his own hand, if occa&s;ion offered. Upon this a proclamation was made, promi&s;ing three thou&s;and demies of gold, each worth half an Engli&s;h noble,
<PB N="136" REF="151">to any per&s;on who &s;hould bring in Graham dead or alive. Meantime that ardent &s;pirit was employed in dige&s;ting his &s;cheme, and he &s;ent me&s;&s;ages to &s;everal of the members of par|liament, during its &s;e&s;&s;ion in October 1436, offering to a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inate the king, and be&s;tow the crown on Sir Robert Stuart, Athole's grand&s;on, nephew and favorite of James.</P>
<P>The court held the fe&s;tival of Chri&s;tmas at Perth; and the contemporary narrative details &s;ome popular &s;tories concerning omens, which happened to James. The wor&s;t omen was his vigorous admini&s;tration, which had created many enemies; among whom the con&s;piracy &s;pread, like a fire among com|bu&s;tible materials, and had even reached the mo&s;t intimate attendants of the palace, without exciting any &s;u&s;picion. Thrice did Chri&s;topher Chambers, one of the traitors, and who had been a &s;quire of the duke of Albany, approach the royal pre&s;ence, to di&s;clo&s;e the plot; and as often did he fail, from accident, or from a mi&s;taken &s;en&s;e of honour, or pity to his a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>At length the con&s;piracy being fully ripened, <NOTE PLACE="marg">20 Feb.</NOTE> a night was fixed for its execution; being that of the &s;econd wedne&s;day in lent, according to Mon&s;trelet, or the twenty &s;eventh day of February in the year one thou&s;and four hundred and thirty-&s;even; but that of the fir&s;t wedne&s;day in lent, between the twentieth and twenty fir&s;t day of that month, by the account of Bowar, which de&s;erves the preference <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, II, f. 98, edit. 1518; Bowar, 503. In 1437 lent began on the 17th Feb. In 1438 on the 2d March. Another argument, if nece&s;&s;ary, to enforce the learned Ruddiman's reply to Abercromby, who, with his u&s;ual igno|rance of chronology, dates this event in 1438. The chartulary of Gla&s;gow, Harl. 4631, has "Obitus Jacobi primi Regis Scotorum, vige&s;imo die Februarii, A. D. Mille&s;imo Quadringente&s;imo, Trige&s;imo Sexto." The chronicle at the end of Winton erroneou&s;ly bears, <HI>fa&s;trens ene,</HI> or &s;hrove-tue&s;day.</NOTE>. The earl of
<PB N="137" REF="152">Athole, and Sir Robert Stuart, were at the court that evening, which was pa&s;&s;ed before &s;upper, and after to a late hour, in the amu&s;ements of the time, in playing at che&s;s and tables, reading romances, &s;inging and mu&s;ic. An Iri&s;h or highland woman, pretending to magic, who had long before given the king a hint of the plot, and had only met with laughter, again came to unfold it; but was referred till the morrow, as the king was bu&s;y at play. An hour after, James called for the parting cup; and he and the company drank, and withdrew. Sir Robert Stuart, private chamberlain to the king, and his chief favourite, is accu&s;ed of &s;poiling the locks of the royal chambers, to prevent their being &s;hut, and even of laying boards acro&s;s a deep ditch, that environed the garden of the Dominican mona&s;tery at Perth, where James was now lodged, in order to enable the con&s;pirators to pa&s;s: but the&s;e offices &s;eem to belong to meaner a&s;&s;ociates, and the guilt of Athole and his grand&s;on is doubtful. After midnight, Graham with about three hundred per&s;ons, mo&s;tly rai&s;ed in the highlands as may be inferred, entered the garden. The king was now in his bed-chamber, &s;tanding before the fire, only dre&s;&s;ed in his night-gown, and conver&s;ing gayly with the queen and her ladies, when, ju&s;t as he threw off his night-gown to go to bed, he heard a great noi&s;e, as of men in armour, crouding and cla&s;hing together, and perceived a blaze of torches. Su&s;|picions of trea&s;on in&s;tantly ari&s;ing, the queen and ladies ran to the chamber-door, but could not fa&s;ten it, the locks being &s;poiled: and the king reque&s;ting them, if po&s;&s;ible, to keep the door &s;hut, attempted to e&s;cape by the windows, but found them clo&s;ely barred with iron. Perceiving no other refuge, he with the fire-tongs and an exertion of &s;trength, tore up a board of the chamber-floor, and letting him&s;elf down dropped the board above him. He was now in one of the&s;e incom|modious
<PB N="138" REF="153">nece&s;&s;aries, u&s;ual in old edifices; but &s;till could not e&s;cape outward, for, by a &s;ad fatality, a &s;quare aperture in the place had been filled with &s;tone, only three days before, by the king's command, becau&s;e the balls were apt to enter it, when he played at tennis. Neverthele&s;s he might here have remained &s;afe, had not his own impatience betrayed him.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the traitors bur&s;t open the chamber-door, and &s;everal of the ladies were hurt; particularly, as our hi&s;torians &s;ay, Catherine Douglas, who, with a &s;pirit worthy of her name, had her arm broken, by thru&s;ting it into the &s;taple in&s;tead of a bar. The ladies &s;hrieking with horror, fled to the furthe&s;t corner of the room; but the queen was &s;o ex|tremely agitated that &s;he &s;tood without power of &s;peech, or motion, and a villain ba&s;ely wounded, and would have &s;lain, her, had not a &s;on of Graham interfered, &s;aying, "What will will you do, for &s;hame of your&s;elf, to the queen? She is but a woman. Let us go and &s;eek the king." The queen was then permitted to withdraw; while the ladies remained lo&s;t in tears and con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>The traitors &s;ought the king in every part of the chamber, and another adjoining, without &s;ucce&s;s. Mo&s;t of them had gone to extend their &s;earch, and a temporary quiet &s;ucceeded, when the king mo&s;t unhappily, after having heard no noi&s;e for &s;ome time, and thinking that the con&s;pirators were gone, called to the ladies to bring &s;heets, and draw him up from his uncomfortable concealment. In the attempt Elizabeth Douglas fell down into the place, and Chambers, one of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, entering with a torch, perceived the king and the lady, and called to his fellows, with &s;avage merriment; "Sirs, the bride is found, for whom we have &s;ought, and caroled all night." Upon this, another traitor, Sir John Hall, leaped down with a dagger in his hand; but the king &s;eized him be|hind,
<PB N="139" REF="154">and threw him under his feet. Hall's brother met with the &s;ame chance: yet the king in vain tried to wre&s;t a dagger from either, and only wounded his hands, and rendered him|&s;elf incapable of further defence. Graham him&s;elf now en|tered the king's retreat, who reque&s;ted his mercy; but Graham exclaimed, "Thou cruel tyrant, thou never had&s;t mercy upon thy noble kindred, nor others, &s;o expect none." James &s;aid, "I be&s;eech thee that, for my &s;oul's &s;alvation, thou wilt let me have a confe&s;&s;or." But Graham retorted, "Thou &s;halt have no confe&s;&s;or but this &s;word;" and &s;tabbed the king, who in vain cried for mercy, and offered half his kingdom for his life. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, &s;omewhat relenting, was about to with|draw, when his comrades above de&s;ired him to complete their intention, el&s;e he &s;hould him&s;elf encounter death at their hands. Graham, and the two Halls, then accompli&s;hed the horrid deed by multiplied wounds.</P>
<P>Thus peri&s;hed James I in the forty-fourth year of his age, and the thirty-fir&s;t of his nominal reign, but only the thirteenth of his active authority.</P>
<P>Not &s;atiated with the murder of their monarch, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;ought the queen, fearing her revenge; but &s;he had now e&s;caped. The rumour at length reaching the outer court, where the &s;ervants were lodged, and thence the town it&s;elf, numbers approached with arms and torches, upon which the con&s;pirators ha&s;tily withdrew. Sir David Dunbar, arriving alone, attacked them, &s;lew one, and wounded another, but was overpowered and left di&s;abled. Straiton, a page, was &s;lain: and the band made good their retreat to the highlands, only regreting that the queen had been &s;aved, who&s;e vengeance they dreaded. Nor without cau&s;e; for, in le&s;s than a month, all the chief actors were in jail.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="155">The fir&s;t taken were Sir Robert Stuart, and Chri&s;topher Chambers: who were executed with cruel tortures at Edin|burgh, and the former's confe&s;&s;ion of guilt may have been forced from his pangs. Athole was taken by Angus, tried and condemned; <NOTE PLACE="marg">31 Mar.</NOTE> but Ea&s;ter approaching, the cro&s;s, upon which his grand&s;on had been tormented, was taken down, as unbecoming that &s;olemnity; and he was fa&s;tened to a pillar, with a paper crown upon his head, thrice in&s;cribed with the term Traitor. Antony bi&s;hop of Urbino, the papal legate in Scotland, heard the confe&s;&s;ions of Stuart, and Athole <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Eneas Sylvius is &s;ub&s;tituted for the bi&s;hop of Urbino by Hector Boyce, the grandfather of all our hi&s;torical errors; and the mi&s;take is religiou&s;ly maintained by all our hi&s;torians.

And in the year that Alfon&s;o of Arragon was captured by the Genoe&s;e&mdash;1435: ib. He returned in the &s;ame year to France: and in 1436 another legate was &s;ent, namely Antony de Santo Vito, bi&s;hop of Urbino. Ughelli Italia Sacra, (Venice 1717, 10 vols. folio) II, 792. His pa&s;&s;port occurs in Rymer, X, 660, and is dated 22 Nov. 1436. Ughelli's account runs thus: "Sexto autem Idus Quintilis proxime in&s;equentis, [1436,] pro re&s;tituenda eccle&s;ia&s;tica di&s;ciplina, alii&s;que longe gravi&s;&s;imis componendis rebus, in Sco|tiam, ad Jacobum regem, cum ampli&s;&s;ima decernendi pote&s;tate ab eodem pontifice [Eugenio IV] legatus e&s;t. Difficillimis Scotiae rebus inopinato Jacobi regis nece magis magi&s;que perturbatis, ad Anglorum regem, &amp;c. dirigitur." Antony de Santo Vito proceeded to the council of Ba&s;il on his return; and was after|wards di&s;tingui&s;hed by his emba&s;&s;ies to Germany, France, and Spain.
<P>In narrating the murder of James I, Jean Chartier, p. 95, &s;ays that the perpetrators were chiefly &s;ervants of Albany, and other lords &s;lain by James, who was a brave and ju&s;t prince, and well beloved by his people.</P></NOTE>. The latter a&s;&s;erted his innocence; but &s;aid that his grand&s;on had propo&s;ed the con&s;piracy, from which he had di&s;&s;uaded him, and under&s;tood that he had &s;ucceeded. It might be &s;aid that Stuart having been forced by torture to confe&s;s guilt, Athole was of cour&s;e obliged to accord with his grand&s;on's te&s;timony;
<PB N="141" REF="156">for it is difficult to conceive that Stuart could have been guilty of &s;uch black ingratitude to his beneficent &s;overeign, and of &s;uch a total &s;acrifice of common prudence, as to engage in this con&s;piracy, from which to expect the diadem mu&s;t have been the infatuation of frenzy. But Graham's art may have practi&s;ed upon his youth, and weakne&s;s, to this degree; and the evidence of his guilt at la&s;t rather preponderates. As to Athole, his hoary head might well have been &s;aved: the laws concerning mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on are mo&s;t &s;evere, calling for a &s;acrifice of kindred, of friend&s;hip, and of human nature: his grand&s;on's &s;cheme he &s;eems to have regarded as too wild for any man of common under&s;tanding to attempt; and was he, for what he expected to pa&s;s as idle di&s;cour&s;e, to proclaim his grand&s;on a madman, or a traitor, and to ruin his po&s;terity? But to leave this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the aged earl was beheaded at Edinburgh; and his head was fixed upon a &s;pear, encircled with a crown of iron.</P>
<P>Graham, and many others of the traitors, were tortured, and put to death, at Stirling. The daring chief of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins had the in&s;olence to plead that, having renounced his allegi|ance under his hand and &s;eal, he had a right to kill the king, as his mortal enemy: nay he addre&s;&s;ed his judges, and the &s;pectators, a&s;&s;uring them that they &s;hould &s;oon pray for his &s;oul, as one to whom they were indebted for their deliverance from a tyrant. Nor was his courage le&s;s than his dark fana|tici&s;m of vengeance, as appeared from the &s;pirit with which he bore his horrid torments. Some of the a&s;&s;ociates a&s;&s;erted that they knew not even the nature of the con&s;piracy, but had been prevailed on to join the party, upon pretence that the in|tention was only to carry off a young lady of the court, whom Sir Robert Stuart was to marry: a circum&s;tance apparently alluded to in the expre&s;&s;ions of Chambers abovementioned.
<PB N="142" REF="157">The &s;on of Graham, Thomas Hall, and Chambers, are parti|cularly mentioned among the victims; and the latter would expre&s;s no repentance for the king's death. This full and minute relation is given, not only as pre&s;enting all the circum|&s;tances of an important event, but as it &s;erves to correct &s;ome mi&s;takes of former writers.</P>
<P>James left only one &s;on, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; but his female i&s;&s;ue con&s;i&s;ted of not le&s;s than five daughters; Margaret married to the Dauphin; I&s;abel to Francis duke of Bretagne; Eleanor to Sigi&s;mund archduke of Au&s;tria; Mary to the count de Boucquan, &s;on of the lord of Campvere; Jean to the earl of Angus, and afterwards to the earl of Morton <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Crawford Stuarts, 36.

<P>Mary's de&s;tiny was more ob&s;cure; but from Coucy, p. 574, &s;he appears to have been wedded before 1449; and her hu&s;band was only a <HI>&s;eigneur.</HI> Olivier de la Marche, the contemporary Burgundian, in his curious memoirs gives &s;ome notices concerning her. He &s;ays "Le &s;eigneur de la Vere, un mout pui&s;&s;ant et notable chevalier Zelandois, du nom et des armes de Bour&s;elle, et qui, par &s;a grande conduite et renomm&eacute;e par la mer, avoit eu la fille du Roy d'E&s;coce, &s;oeur germaine de Madame la Dauphine, dont cy-de&s;&s;us e&s;t faicte mention; et l'avoit mari&eacute;e a &s;on fils le Comte de Boucquam." p. 263, 264. And p. 332, ed. Gand, 1566, 410, he mentions that the counte&s;s of Boucquan (<HI>&s;ic</HI>) daughter of Scot|land was delivered of a &s;on at Vere in Zealand, and the count of Charolois, &s;on of Burgundy, went to Vere on the occa&s;ion.

It is &s;u&s;pected that the prince&s;s Jean, wedded to Huntley about 1470, was a daughter of James II; perhaps of the queen of James I, by her &s;econd marriage. Yet a genealogy of 1484, MS.

<P>WHETHER education, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1371&mdash;</NOTE> climate, or government, pro|duce mo&s;t effect on national character, is an impor|tant problem, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by many able writers, but hitherto not &s;ufficiently re&s;olved. It mu&s;t however be granted by all, that each has its &s;hare in exciting or depre&s;&s;ing mental energy, in e&s;tabli&s;hing general indu&s;try or indolence, in promoting public happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. But of the&s;e grand cau&s;es education &s;eems de&s;ervedly to claim the preeminence. To deny the power of climate, would be to forget that man is "&s;ubject to the &s;kyey influences;" yet his indu&s;try, or care, my gene|rally
<PB N="144" REF="159">overcome or elude its effects: and &s;oil is almo&s;t equally &s;ub&s;ervient to labour. Government exerts a more pervading influence; even the pea&s;ant in his cottage is oppre&s;&s;ed by the burning heat of de&s;poti&s;m, or the bla&s;ting &s;torms of anarchy. The rewards of his labour cea&s;e amid the general di&s;tre&s;s: the caprice of &s;ome little tyrant, for &s;laves are ever tyrants where they can, or the revenge of a foe, may a&s;&s;ail his hovel; and while his family peri&s;hes in penury, the labourer joins the mountain robbers, and falls the victim of tho&s;e laws which afforded him no protection. Even moderate governments affect dome&s;tic life, and individuals, more than is commonly conceived; a war, a tax, an unwi&s;e law, becomes an univer&s;al misfortune; while the benignity, and &s;kill, of the rulers en|large the happine&s;s of all. The influence, like that of the electric element, is rarely unveiled to the popular eye, though the &s;ubtile fluid operate mo&s;t widely on the public health.</P>
<P>In the oriental legi&s;lations the connexion between laws and manners is often indi&s;&s;oluble: and the laws become perpetual, by being grafted on the habits of that creature of habit, man. In Europe, on the contrary, the laws and manners are pro|verbially di&s;tinct. Juri&s;diction puni&s;hes crimes, but rewards not virtues; far le&s;s can it improve dome&s;tic morals, or dif|fu&s;e the light of in&s;truction over a benighted nation. The&s;e are the &s;acred provinces of education, a cau&s;e of national cha|racter more prevalent than either of the former, as it &s;trikes the very root of offence, and &s;ows la&s;ting &s;eeds of intelligence and worth.</P>
<P>But education, on the exten&s;ive &s;cale here implied, remains an experiment even to the mo&s;t civilized nations; and its effects mu&s;t neither be regarded as &s;peedy, nor infinite. Even infants di&s;play, &s;ome a perver&s;e, others a placid di&s;po&s;ition: and it is doubtful whether any care or art can eradicate, or
<PB N="145" REF="160">&s;ubdue, the inborn temper. If the bad habits of an individual prove often unconquerable by rea&s;on or virtue, how deeply mu&s;t &s;uch habits be rooted in a whole people, where example operates like a contagion?</P>
<P>Hence it is that the &s;pirit, and manners, of the people ought to pre&s;ent the main object of political di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on any particular &s;tate, and the more e&s;pecially where government and education have little force. In whatever form of admini&s;tra|tion, only a part can &s;hine upon the public theatre, and thus attract the notice of hi&s;tory. The ma&s;s of the nation remains in ob&s;curity, even in enlightened ages; and philo&s;ophy can only e&s;timate its hi&s;tory by that of its manners, for which the be&s;t materials are to be found, not in the pages of the annali&s;t, but in poems, novels, and romances. Barren however as are the annals of the poor, their &s;tate may always be ju&s;tly e&s;ti|mated by that of the actors, who vaunt and vani&s;h in the hi&s;toric &s;cene; and from the progre&s;s of nations, as &s;avage, barbarous, or civilized. The monki&s;h page pre&s;ents but a &s;mall pul&s;e, yet from it the health, or &s;ickne&s;s, of the whole body may be gathered with con&s;iderable certainty.</P>
<P>In Scotland, at the period now under review, the people were &s;lowly advancing from barbari&s;m towards civilization. A peace of &s;ome duration had taken place before the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Stuart; and the con&s;equent intercour&s;e with England, a country then rapidly progre&s;&s;ive in the arts of life, mu&s;t have increa&s;ed the national energy. Yet the feudal &s;et|ters continued to be firmly rivetted: every man was the &s;oldier, or the menial attendant of his chief; and flocks, herds, agri|culture afforded only &s;ub&s;ervient occupations. While the &s;ingle &s;cience of the great was war, their &s;ole amu&s;ement hunting, their chief magnificence a numerous train, it is no wonder that the poor were ferocious and idle, &s;ecure during health of a main|tenance
<PB N="146" REF="161">from their lords, and in &s;ickne&s;s of mona&s;tic charity. Courage hone&s;ty, frankne&s;s, attachment to their chiefs, con|&s;tituted the chief virtues of the pea&s;antry; temperance, and &s;obriety were the virtues of the &s;oil: &s;pirituous liquors, that bane of the poor, were as yet unknown in Europe, except among the &s;tores of the phy&s;ician. Nor had religious fanati|ci&s;m, that unintermitting intoxication, yet poi&s;oned the popu|lar mind with habitual gloom: the poor chiefly knew the chri&s;tian religion from its charity, from the public exhortations of the preaching friars, and from the gay exhibitions of the Roman catholic &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>By more poli&s;hed foreigners Scotland continued to be re|garded as a country completely barbarous. The author of the Dittamundi allows that it is rich in fi&s;h, fle&s;h, and milk, but,</P>

<P>The long and &s;evere ordinances of Robert II again&s;t mur|derers, and their receivers and &s;upporters, afford a proof that this charge was not unfounded <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Stat. Rob. II, apud Skene.</NOTE>. And the orders to the army, not to pillage their own countrymen, pre&s;ent another in&s;tance
<PB N="147" REF="162">of barbaric manners <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Reg. 4to, f. v. 72.</NOTE>. The <HI>Ketherani,</HI> Kerns, or marauding highlanders, by continual inroads into the low countries greatly ob&s;tructed the progre&s;s of indu&s;try and civilization; and this inte&s;tine evil, more pernicious than foreign inva&s;ion, continued to a late period. Strangers to that indu&s;try which excites the Swi&s;s pea&s;ant to cultivate the precipice, and the Norwegian to derive that &s;upport from the &s;ea which the land refu&s;es, the highlanders &s;upplied their wants by rapine: and the civil ani|mo&s;ity was increa&s;ed by the difference of origin, language, and manners; &s;o that the difficulties with which the government had to &s;truggle, and the ob&s;tacles again&s;t order, were perhaps greater in Scotland than in any other European kingdom. The example of Henry II of England, who planted a Flemi&s;h colony in Wales, e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation, or exceeded the power, of our monarchs: and the complete tran&s;po&s;ition of the population of a province, though an expedient far from unknown to the Per&s;ians, Greeks, and Romans, appears to &s;urpa&s;s the wi&s;dom, or the enterprize of any later government.</P>
<P>Though the pea&s;antry were in fact the &s;laves of their lords, by menial or by feudal bondage, yet few in&s;tances occur of ab&s;olute villanage; and it is believed no example appears in our records, of an e&s;tate &s;old with the farmers, labourers, and families, attached to the &s;oil <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ni&s;bet in his Heraldry, Vol. I, p. 131, gives an extract of a charter of Robert I, regni 14, from the chartulary of Dunfermlin, declaring Adam Adam&s;on and his four &s;ons free: "declaratum e&s;t quod Adamus filius Adami non e&s;t homo no&s;ter ligius, &s;eu nativus, quin pro voluntate &s;ua;" and he and &s;ons were delivered "ab omni jugo et onere &s;ervitutis;" executed "coram ju&s;ticiario no&s;tro."</NOTE>. The appellation <HI>hu&s;bond,</HI> given to the Scoti&s;h farmers, &s;eems indeed to imply that they were con&s;idered as bond &s;laves of their lord's hou&s;e, or as fixed
<PB N="148" REF="163">to their own particular farm-hou&s;es; yet what little evidence remains teaches us to con&s;ider them rather as &s;laves in cu&s;tom, than in law. The <HI>hu&s;band lands,</HI> or farms, were divided into tillage and pa&s;turage, were always &s;mall, and the farmers of cour&s;e poor <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Skene de &s;ign. verb. voce <HI>Hu&s;band-land,</HI> originally about &s;ix acres.</NOTE>. The cotter who rears his hovel of turf and &s;traw, under an old thorn, and cultivates three or four acres of the common, would in the&s;e ages have been &s;tyled a farmer. Large farms undoubtedly advance agriculture; and perhaps the numerous labourers employed are as u&s;eful and valuable members of &s;ociety, as if each farmed a &s;mall portion of land.</P>
<P>With the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Stuart, a &s;tronger light begins to ari&s;e on the internal &s;tate of Scotland. Barbour wrote his celebrated poem in 1375; and in narrating the actions of Robert I, he pre&s;ents many pictures of the times and manners, the lap&s;e of half a century being imperceptible in the &s;low progre&s;s of civilization. But the curio&s;ity of Froi&s;&s;art a &s;tranger has pre&s;erved the &s;tronge&s;t features; and his vi&s;it to Scotland forms an epoch in the hi&s;tory of national manners <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art was in England in 1391, Tome IV, fol. 14. He was at Dal|keith in his youth, about the year 1360, T. III, f. 117: and no other vi&s;it of his to Scotland is known. It is not therefore wonderful that, when he wrote his hi&s;tory in 1400, his memory made &s;ome &s;lips, particularly the &s;trange one concerning the hou&s;e of Douglas, which mi&s;led lord Hailes, Remarks, p. 121. Froi&s;&s;art confounds the earls of Douglas with the Dougla&s;es lords of Dalkeith; nay he a&s;&s;igns to that name the arms of the earls of Moray, "d'or a trois oreilles de gueulles!" His more recent information was derived from the French knights who vi&s;ited Scotland.</NOTE>. From his account it appears that the French, them&s;elves regarded by the Italians as barbarians, &s;huddered at the penury and barbarity of Scotland. Even in the <HI>Doulce E&s;coche</HI> or low lands, (for the highlanders of <HI>la Sauvage E&s;co|che</HI> were con&s;idered as we now do American &s;avages,) a re|markable
<PB N="149" REF="164">ignorance prevailed of the commone&s;t arts of life. The meane&s;t articles of manufacture, hor&s;e-&s;hoes, harne&s;s, &s;addles, bridles, were all imported ready made from Flanders. The hou&s;es of the common people were compo&s;ed of four or five po&s;ts to &s;upport the turf walls, and a roof of boughs: three days &s;ufficed to erect the humble man&s;ion <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, Tome II, f. 170, edit. 1518, 4to.</NOTE>. A contemporary hi&s;torian adds, that "the country was rather de&s;ert than inha|bited, was almo&s;t wholly mountainous, and more abundant in &s;avages than in cattle. <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de Charles VI, par Le Laboureur, Tome I, p. 102, "plus pleine de &s;auvagine que de be&s;tail."</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h education of James I contributed to the civi|lization of his kingdom. Yet even in his reign the picture by Enea Silvio, afterwards pope Pius II, is far from flattering. "Concerning Scotland he found the&s;e things worthy of repe|tition. It is an <HI>i&s;land joined</HI> to England, &s;tretching two hun|dred miles to the north, and about fifty broad; a cold country, fertile of few &s;orts of grain, and generally void of trees, but there is a &s;ulphureous &s;tone dug up which is u&s;ed for firing. The towns are unwalled, the hou&s;es commonly built without lime, and in villages roofed with turf, while a cow's hide &s;up|plies the place of a door.

<P>The vigorous admini&s;tration of James I imparted tranquil|lity and happine&s;s to the people; and was often regretted by them during the di&s;tractions of the &s;ub&s;equent reigns <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See Bowar, 510</NOTE>. Till this period the &s;tatutes were concealed from the nation in the darkne&s;s of the latin language; the good &s;en&s;e of this monarch ordered them to be i&s;&s;ued in the Scoti&s;h tongue, while in England the laws were to be dictated in Latin and French till the reign of Richard III. Thus religion, and law, the &s;ole
<PB N="151" REF="166">rules of popular conduct, were veiled from the people; but there is no ab&s;urdity which man has not reduced to practice. The &s;tatures of James are wi&s;ely ordained to advance civili|zation, and the &s;anguine theori&s;t may exult in their effects; but they rather proclaim the intelligence of the monarch, and of his eccle&s;ia&s;tic mini&s;ters, than the national advancement. Ordinances prepared in the cabinet by wi&s;e and good men, were pa&s;&s;ed by the lords of the articles; while the peers and landholders, with whom the juri&s;diction lay, either did not attend, or voted with a &s;mile. And the frequent repetition of the &s;ame laws, even &s;o late as the reigns of James IV an V, con&s;pires with the records of hi&s;tory to convince us, that the &s;tatutes rather indicate the evils that did exi&s;t, than the remedy of the&s;e evils. The roots of national habits are too deep to be affected by the thunder of laws, the &s;low divul|&s;ion of education can alone explode them.</P>
<P>Among the &s;tatures of the fir&s;t James, the following are the mo&s;t pertinent to the pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. That no private wars be allowed; that none travel with more attendants than they maintain; that no <HI>&s;ornars</HI> &s;hall force their re&s;idence upon the clergy or farmers; that in burghs, and no high ways, inns be erected; and that no beggars be permitted, except di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a badge importing the leave of the magi&s;trates: and the ho&s;pitals for the poor and &s;ick are ordered to be re|formed. A remarkable law ordains, that all idle per&s;ons, without means of livelihood, &s;hall be impri&s;oned, till they give &s;ecurity, and &s;hall within forty days betake them&s;elves to &s;ome &s;ervice or craft. The trial of the cau&s;es of the poor is declared to be gratuitous <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 1, 2, 5, 7, 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The in&s;titution of inns, repeatedly enforced, was perhaps calculated to &s;ave the mona&s;teries from the frequent intru&s;ion
<PB N="152" REF="167">of numerous gue&s;ts; but the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch laws indicates a radical defect in civilization. The fir&s;t object of the Romans, after the conque&s;t of a barbaric country, was to open high ways through it; for on mutual and ea&s;y intercour&s;e all civilization depends. Yet this fir&s;t and indi&s;pen&s;able &s;tep is unknown in our &s;tatutes. Some regulations appear concerning ferries; but till within the&s;e fifty years the roads in Scotland were hardly pa&s;&s;able. And while the Swi&s;s cuts his way through the Alps, our mole hills in the highlands pre&s;ent in&s;uperable barriers. The civilization of a country is always in exact proportion to the number, and condition, of its high ways. The omi&s;&s;ion of this one law was radical, and ob&s;tructed all the others <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t Scoti&s;h &s;tatute concerning highways, is of the reign of Charles II, 1661, cap. 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the burghs a greater degree of civilization mu&s;t have prevailed than in the country; but the inhabitants of the burghs were few, compared with the general population. Froi&s;&s;art e&s;timates the hou&s;es in Edinburgh, then the capital, at four thou&s;and <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Tome II, f. v. 169.</NOTE>; they were &s;mall wooden cottages, covered with &s;traw; for modern Edinburgh, with its hou&s;es of ten or twelve &s;tories, cannot date higher than Mary's reign, when all the French cu&s;toms of Scotland really commenced. By a com|mon calculation the inhabitants of the capital, in the reign of Robert II, hardly exceeded &s;ixteen thou&s;and.</P>
<P>For &s;ome unknown cau&s;e, James I prohibited the election of deacons of crafts; perhaps they abu&s;ed their power in ex|citing &s;edition; perhaps the genuine &s;pirit of a corporation began to operate in monopoly, and oppre&s;&s;ion. But a warden and council are ordered to regulate prices, the warden to be cho&s;en by the council of the burgh, and not, as the deacons, by the craft&s;men them&s;elves. Ma&s;ons, carpenters, &s;miths,

<P>James I has him&s;elf delineated the manners of the common people, in his poem called Peblis to the Play. This <HI>play</HI> was probably an annual fe&s;tival, in honour of the &s;aint to whom the church was dedicated, or on &s;ome other occa&s;ion; and &s;uch <HI>wakes</HI> are yet known in the north of England. The humour and jollity of the meeting end in tumult and uproar, but di&s;|play a very different character to the gloomy fanatici&s;m of the two &s;ucceeding centuries. From this &s;ingular poem, among other articles of manners, we learn that the women wore kerchiefs and hoods, and tippets; the mu&s;ic aro&s;e from the bagpipe; the men &s;ometimes wore hats of birch-twigs inter|woven, the hat being any high covering of the head, while the bonnet was flat. A tavern, with fair table linen, and a regular &s;core on the wall, are introduced: the reckoning twopence halfpenny a piece, is collected in a wooden trencher. The <HI>cadger,</HI> or packman who carries fi&s;h, &amp;c. through the country, on his little hor&s;e; the &s;almon dance, con&s;i&s;ting in exertions

<P>The dre&s;s of the common people con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of a doublet and cloke, and a kind of &s;hort trow&s;e; the head was covered with a hat of ba&s;ket-work, or felt, or with a woolen bonnet; while the logs and feet remained bare <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">A practice prevalent among the common people of England on this period. Even the feet of many of the Engli&s;h archers were bare in battle. St. Remy, p. 89.</NOTE>. Shirts were hardly known even to the great. The female dre&s;s was a kerchief or a hood, and a tippet about the neck: the kirtle, or clo&s;e gown, was rarely accompanied either with the <HI>wylicot</HI> or under petticoat, or with the mantle; and the feet were naked.</P>
<P>As the &s;tate of &s;ociety was rather pa&s;toral than agricultural, milk, and its various preparations, formed a chief article of food. Meat boiled with oatmeal, or fi&s;h, &s;upplied more &s;o|lemn meals. Bread and vegetables were little u&s;ed, a circum|&s;tance to which it may perhaps be imputed that the lepro&s;y was not uncommon. The chief fi&s;h was the &s;almon, concern|ing the capture of which many regulations occur in the acts of parliament, and which al&s;o formed a grand article in the Scoti&s;h exports.</P>

<P>THE government, and laws, of a country are &s;o intimately connected with its hi&s;tory, when compo&s;ed in a proper manner, and with philo&s;ophic views, that little remains to be added on
<PB N="155" REF="170">the&s;e important topics, except to glean a few remarks, and pre&s;ent &s;ome general ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The policy concerning the highlands formed a chief object in the Scoti&s;h government. David II had excited the chief|tains to de&s;troy each other, by be&s;towing the e&s;tate of the &s;laughtered leader on his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and by the reign of terror had e&s;tabli&s;hed tranquillity <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Fordun, II, 380.</NOTE>. This cruel policy was aban|doned by the hou&s;e of Stuart. Robert II a&s;&s;igned the high|lands to the care of his &s;on the earl of Carric, and other peers; who were impowered to call the chiefs before them, and concert means of ju&s;tice <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Regi&s;ter, f. v. 72.</NOTE>. But this plan erred in the other extreme of mildne&s;s: and James I, after having been obliged &s;o exempt the highlanders from the law of retribu|tion, becau&s;e, as the &s;tatute bears, they had been accu&s;tomed to rob and kill each other <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 8.</NOTE>, was at length con&s;trained, as we have &s;een, to have recour&s;e to &s;everity.</P>
<P>The reign of this prince revived the long dormant power of the laws, and the bolde&s;t of the peers dared not to oppo&s;e his mandates or me&s;&s;engers. "The people," adds the old hi&s;|toriographers, "then &s;at in the opulence of peace, &s;ecure from ravagers, elate in heart, and tranquil in mind; becau&s;e the monarch had wi&s;ely expelled quarrels and rapine from the &s;tate, had appea&s;ed di&s;cord, and reconciled enmity <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 510.</NOTE>." But the regal juri&s;diction, though much confined by the feudal &s;y&s;tem, was carried by James I to a height that proved fatal to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to dwell on the feudal government, &s;o ably di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by numerous authors. A &s;ingular feature of it in Scotland was the freedom from taxes; and that at a period
<PB N="156" REF="171">when France was overwhelmed with them, and the blood of the poor, as u&s;ual, was mingled with the wine of the rich <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">In 1385 the taxes were &s;o numerous in France that many emigrated. Des Ur&s;ins, p. 46.</NOTE>. Another remarkable di&s;tinction from modern times was, that the royal authority was weakened in war, and increa&s;ed in peace. The &s;oldiers belonged to their chiefs, and not the &s;overeign: but the execution of the laws was a prerogative of the latter.</P>
<P>An idea of the royal revenue may be formed from the mar|riage contracts of our princes, the dower of the wife being e&s;timated at one third of the whole. Robert II, and III, were married before the acce&s;&s;ion of the family: and the avaricious conduct of the Engli&s;h court, in the marriage of James I, rendered any contract to this effect unnece&s;&s;ary. But that of James II and Mary of Gelder is extant; and though the evi|dence be &s;omewhat excur&s;ive it is &s;ufficiently in point <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">MS. Harl. 4637, Vol. III, f. v. 6.</NOTE>. The dower a&s;&s;igned is 10,000 crowns of gold; and the&s;e crowns, in a contemporary &s;tatute, are e&s;timated at &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence each, Scoti&s;h money <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Acts of 1451.</NOTE>. Hence 10,000 gold crowns equalled 5000 marks Scoti&s;h money, and the royal revenue was 15,000 marks Scoti&s;h, or about 7,500 marks &s;terling of that time; in weight about 14,000 pounds of &s;ilver, in efficacy about &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds of modern currency. But the rapacity of &s;tate&s;men and favorites, and other cau&s;es which did not affect the e&s;tates of the ari&s;tocracy, con&s;iderably dila|pidated the revenue of the crown, and rendered it &s;ubject to fuch variations that fifty thou&s;and pounds may mo&s;t &s;afely be a&s;&s;umed as a medium. Perhaps the earls of Douglas po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a revenue equal to two thirds of the royal; which however certainly more than doubled that of any other peer <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In the e&s;timate of the revenues of the ho&s;tages for James I, (Rymer, X, 327, 333,) the highe&s;t are tho&s;e of Argyle and Dalkeith, 1500 marks &s;terling. each. But that of Douglas mu&s;t have been far larger. The 1500 marks might now equal 15,000 <HI>l.</HI>
<P>It mu&s;t not be forgotten that the royal expences were almo&s;t wholly dome&s;tic, there being neither civil nor military lift, the officers of &s;tate and admini&s;trators of law being only paid by perqui&s;ites; and even emba&s;&s;ies were defrayed by the members of parliament, or by the merchants. The revenue of Henry V of England was 55,714<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> (Rymer, X, 113,) or about 550,000 modern pounds.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="172">The revenue of the crown aro&s;e chiefly from its deme&s;nes, from the various feudal ca&s;ualties, ward, relief, marriage, e&s;cheat, forfeiture; from vacant bi&s;hoprics, fines, pre&s;ents for grants; and from cu&s;toms on merchandize. Its preroga|tives appear to have been, 1. to &s;ummon the parliament, and propo&s;e laws, which &s;eldom or never failed to pa&s;s: 2. the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice: 3. creation of honours and dignities: 4. command of the national array: 5. nomination to eccle|&s;ia&s;tic preferments. As the fir&s;t of the&s;e prerogatives en|croached on the legi&s;lative power; &s;o, on the other hand, the parliament regulated emba&s;&s;es and treaties, and ordered peace or war <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">This important fact is evinced from many documents in this work. See particularly the reign of James V.</NOTE>. The coinage of money belonged to the crown; but any alteration was regarded as uncon&s;titutional, if not &s;anc|tioned by parliament.</P>
<P>Hence it appears that the revenues and power of the Scoti&s;h monarchs were in them&s;elves &s;ufficiently re&s;pectable; but the age of Robert II, the weakne&s;s of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the di&s;orders of the regencies, and above all the extreme avarice of the ari&s;tocracy, ever preying on the royal domains and revenue, were cau&s;es that greatly injured both the wealth and influence of the crown.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing to the national council, or parliament, the mo&s;t &s;triking object is the number of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, which exceeded
<PB N="158" REF="173">that of the peers <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">In the parliament at Cambu&s;kenneth, 1314, the number of abbots already amounted to 14, Scone, Kel&s;o, Arbroth, Holyrood, Lindoris, Newbottel, Caput, Paisley, Dunfermlin, Lincluden, Inchaffray, St. Colm, Deer, Sweet|heart. The priors 5, Coldingham, Re&s;tenoth, St. Andrews, Pittenweem, Loch|leven. Add the bi&s;hops 13, and the &s;um is thirty-two.</NOTE>. But till the days of Forman, and the Be|tons, prie&s;tly ambition &s;eems to have been little known in Scotland; and the &s;tatutes generally evince great wi&s;dom and patrioti&s;m in the legi&s;lative body. The members unhappily did not a&s;&s;emble in two chambers as in England; the burge&s;&s;es were annihilated in pre&s;ence of the powerful ari&s;tocracy, who them&s;elves only &s;killed in arms left legi&s;lative di&s;cu&s;&s;ion to the clergy. An oppo&s;ition was &s;carce ever known in the Scoti&s;h parliament, becau&s;e its operations were previou&s;ly &s;ettled by the well-known committees of lords of the articles, and ap|proved by the king, &s;o that in fact the &s;tatutes were pre&s;ented for its &s;anction, not its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Nay there is room to believe that an oppo&s;ition in parliament was viewed in as trea&s;onable a light as oppo&s;ition in the field; and that the minority only te&s;tified its di&s;&s;atisfaction by its nonappearance.</P>
<P>The admini&s;tration of the laws was the chief difficulty; and the king and parliament often recommended this great object to the peers in their re&s;pective territories. During a minority the parliament alone had the power of nominating a regent and council <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">See the reign of James V when the parliament declare that, by the king's demi&s;e, the power had <HI>devolved to the three e&s;tates</HI> who had appointed Albany regent. Yet the will of the decea&s;ed monarch was commonly re&s;pected; and the queens of James I, II, and IV, were acknowledged as regents for a time.</NOTE>. At what preci&s;e period the king's privy council fucceeded the <HI>Aula Regis,</HI> or council of great officers of &s;tate is dubious. It was much on the &s;ame model, being compo&s;ed of the chancellor, chamberlain, trea&s;urer, privy &s;eal, &s;ecretary, and a few other members. Its power during a minority was
<PB N="159" REF="174">great, but at other times entirely under the controul of the &s;overeign, and hardly known in hi&s;tory. Far &s;uperior was the fate of the privy council in Denmark and Sweden, where the members u&s;urped the chief power; and under the name of <HI>&s;enates</HI> controuled the monarchs. The want of titular nobility in the&s;e countries was a radical cau&s;e of this &s;ingularity, for the prelates having no balance to their a&s;cendancy, and mo&s;t of them being &s;enators in virtue of their &s;ees, the landholders, burge&s;&s;es, and pea&s;ants, could not &s;truggle again&s;t &s;o powerful an ari&s;tocracy. In Scotland, on the contrary, the bi&s;hops and the church were a public benefit, as they balanced the power of the ferocious nobles, and &s;upported the monarch and the laws. All in&s;titutions depend on time and circum&s;tances; and the bane of one country may be the felicity of another.</P>
<P>Had our kings po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the nomination of the admini&s;trators of ju&s;tice, the ari&s;tocratic influence would have been con&s;ide|rably checked. But mo&s;t of the legal officers enjoyed heredi|tary and indefea&s;ible right. Such were the &s;heriffs, though e&s;teemed the king's peculiar officers; nay the peers were &s;ome|times hereditary &s;heriffs in their own juri&s;dictions.</P>
<P>Even in burghs, the aldermen and baillies were more fre|quently devoted to &s;ome neighbouring chief, than to the king.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Mair</HI> and <HI>Serjands</HI> little is known. An act of James I &s;eems to evince that the office of Mair and King's Serjand was &s;ynonymous; and it &s;hews that the barons had al&s;o their &s;erjands. The Mair was de&s;tingui&s;hed by a red wand; the officer of regality by a &s;imilar badge, red at one end and white at the other; while the baron &s;erjand had a white wand, and he of the burgh a red. All bore horns to &s;ound occa&s;ionally <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 17. Another &s;tatute, f. v. 19, mentions Mairs of fee, or heredi|tary, of the &s;heriffdom, or of part; and authori&s;es them to have deputies, to execute arre&s;ts and &s;ummon&s;es. It is &s;u&s;pected that the <HI>Murmor</HI> of the eleventh century, (Enq. into Sc. hi&s;t. II, 319,) was the <HI>Mur</HI> MAR or great Mair of a province, a term &s;ynonymous to the ancient Earl. In the glo&s;&s;ary of Ducange the word Mair or Major implies in numerous in&s;tances great authority. The office of Coroner &s;eems to have confined to criminal ca&s;es, that of Mair to civil. In the i&s;le of Man there were <HI>Moares</HI> for every <HI>&s;heading,</HI> or di&s;trict of three pari&s;hes: (Order of the Tinwald 1422, in Townley's Journal, White|haven 1791, II, 231, 232.) By one of tho&s;e &s;ingular changes which occur in &s;ociety, the &s;heriff remains a mo&s;t honourable office; and the Mair, formerly almo&s;t his equal, has dwindled into the bailiff.</NOTE>. The terms Mair and Serjand have varied
<PB N="160" REF="175">more in &s;ignification than perhaps any others; even now a &s;erjeant at law is a very remote office from a &s;erjeant in the army; and a <HI>Maire</HI> of Paris from a Scoti&s;h Mair. In its pri|mitive meaning the term Mair is, in various countries, of high dignity, but had now been degraded in Scotland from the magi&s;trate to the me&s;&s;enger. The Mair and Serjeants were the heralds of the law; but their office was in tho&s;e times arduous, and honourable, and worthy of the attention of the legi&s;lature. Even the&s;e offices were often hereditary; and Skene mentions that in his time there were "Mairs of fee. <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">De verb. &s;ign. voce <HI>Marus.</HI></NOTE>."</P>
<P>The legal juri&s;diction of the crown chiefly appeared in the <HI>Brief,</HI> or &s;hort writ, i&s;&s;ued from the chancery.

<P>The royal power, though eminent in times of peace, and uncircurn&s;cribed by any &s;enate, was neverthele&s;s balanced by that of the ari&s;tocracy; which during war, or minorities, even a&s;&s;umed the a&s;cendancy <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Coronation oaths are &s;olemn trifles, and they appear unknown to our old annals.

The baron was in fact a king in
<PB N="161" REF="176">his own juri&s;diction; and the operation of the laws was directed by his loyalty, or his di&s;&s;atisfaction. The former was hardly to be &s;ecured, except by a munificence which weakened the royal revenue, and power: this avaricious &s;pirit of the nobility was encrea&s;ed by the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Stuart, and the peculiar circum&s;tances which accompanied that event. A family, formerly their equal, a&s;cended the throne; there was no regal ance&s;try, no foreign &s;plendor, to command awe and obedience: and a dubious loyalty was only to be won by con|ce&s;&s;ions, or promi&s;es, fatal to the con&s;titutional a&s;cendency of the crown. Age, weakne&s;s, regencies, con&s;pired to increa&s;e the wealth and preponderance of the ari&s;tocracy; and when James I regained his &s;ceptre; many an effort was required in order to replace its chief gems.</P>
<P>The few peers, their number hardly exceeding twenty, continued to be chiefly denominated from the counties into which Scotland was then divided <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">The chief deviations were, that there never was an earl of <HI>Mearns,</HI> but Crawford &s;upplied the place. <HI>Leven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x,</HI> or the banks of the Leven, (now <HI>Len|nox</HI>) gave a title corre&s;ponding to Dumbarton&s;hire.

<PB N="162" REF="177">&s;hire, and the greater part of its civil juri&s;diction, were in the hands of the&s;e potentates; and the inferior barons were at|tached to them by tenure, by clan, by intere&s;t and expectation, or by bonds of manrent.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of government, legi&s;lation, and the u&s;eful arts and &s;ciences, ought to occupy mo&s;t attention in hi&s;tory; but the&s;e pacific objects yield to wars and revolutions. War un|happily forms the grand ba&s;is of the annals of man; and one battle often produces the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of many millions, for many centuries. Hence the ancient cla&s;&s;ical hi&s;torians are ample in de&s;cribing the tactics of various nations; while modern writers &s;eem to vie with tho&s;e of the middle ages in their negligence of this important theme, which, form its in|finite con&s;equences, de&s;erves to be arranged in the &s;ame cla&s;s with the government and laws of a country.</P>
<P>It is well known that the chief weapon of the Scots was the &s;pear, often ineffectual again&s;t the Engli&s;h long-bow, becau&s;e it was not accompanied, as in the Macedonian phalanx, with &s;trong defen&s;ive armour. The buckler in particular &s;eems to have been &s;mall and weak, being only of wicker work covered with leather; the <HI>&s;allad</HI> or iron cap, and the <HI>doublet of fence,</HI> mu&s;t have afforded little protection again&s;t the Engli&s;h arrows, which like the Parthian even pierced the mail of the knight. Other offen&s;ive weapons were the <HI>brogged &s;taff</HI> or pike, the axe, the &s;word, the knife or dagger <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Winton MS. 842, 868. Acts, f. v. 8, f. 21.</NOTE>. Such were the arms of the common people: but the chiefs, knights, and &s;quires, were arrayed in plate-armour which had now &s;ucceeded the habergeon, or coat of &s;mall inwoven rings; and they wielded the battle-axe, the two handed &s;word, the iron mace, or the &s;pear. Per&s;ons worth ten pounds of yearly rent, or fifty
<PB N="163" REF="178">pounds in goods, were ordered to have a <HI>hat</HI> or helmet, and gorget; a pe&s;an braced before and behind, with plates to cover the front or the thighs and legs, and gauntlets. The yeomen worth twenty pounds in effects, were to have the habergeon, iron hat, bow, quiver, &s;word, buckler, knife; and, if not archers, an axe, or a pike. The burge&s;s worth fifty pounds in goods, was to arm completely as a gentleman; while he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not above twenty, appeared in the array of the yeoman <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>James I was particularly anxious to e&s;tabli&s;h the u&s;e of the bow, and ordered frequent a&s;&s;emblies near the pari&s;h churches for the exerci&s;e of archery: but after his death the national habits prevailed, and among a hundred attendants of a baron, hardly &s;ix archers could be found, the remainder re&s;uming their &s;pears <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 488.</NOTE>. It appears that armour, nay &s;pears, and bows, and arrows, were chiefly imported <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Act, f. v. 8: in particular the heads of arrows and of &s;pears &s;eem to have been entirely imported form Flanders.</NOTE>. The martial mu&s;ic, as is well known, con&s;i&s;ted of horns. Some cho&s;en followers were arrayed in the livery of their chiefs; but the re&s;t of the army pre&s;ented a motley mixture <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art lo&s;es all temper in &s;peaking of Scotland, and the Scots, on account of the treatment of Vienne and his petulant knights. The admiral, &s;ays he, told the French king, that he would rather be earl of Savoy, or Artois, than king of Scotland; the force of which con&s;i&s;ted of about 500 lances (3000 men at arms,) and 30,300 commoners, of no avail again&s;t Engli&s;h archers, or 1000 men at arms, fol, 183, T.

<P>The di&s;cipline, and exerci&s;e, were trivial; the arrangement was by clans. On the march almo&s;t every man rode a &s;mall hor&s;e, to &s;ave fatigue; but none, except the knights or fixed cavalry, remained on hor&s;eback in a battle. Each man carried
<PB N="164" REF="179">provi&s;ions for forty days, chiefly oat-meal; but meat was &s;up|plied by pillage. The right wing became the van, the left the rear, while the center retained its &s;tation.</P>
<P>The exact order of battle, the arrangement of the ranks and files, are &s;ubjects enveloped in much ob&s;curity; and while, with all the lights of the Roman cla&s;&s;ics, it remains doubtful whether that great people arranged their Ha&s;tati, Principes, and Triarii, in &s;ingle lines, or in deep files, there is le&s;s room to wonder at the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the monki&s;h hi&s;torians. Yet it appears &s;ufficiently clear that deep files were u&s;ed, and that the <HI>battels</HI> or battalions were almo&s;t &s;quare; though &s;ome|times they fought in an <HI>e&s;chelle</HI> or circle; &s;ometimes perhaps in the gothic wedge <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">The <HI>e&s;chelle</HI> was by the Scots termed a <HI>&s;hiltrum.</HI> The ho&s;t was &s;ometimes divided into three or four of the&s;e <HI>&s;hiltrums</HI> of the heavy armed and &s;pearmen, amid which the archers and light infantry were &s;heltered, as by fortre&s;&s;es. See Holin&s;hed's de&s;cription of the battle of Falkirk.</NOTE>. Thin files of two or three &s;eem a modern invention, long po&s;terior to the u&s;e of cannon and fire arms. But the utility of the deep ma&s;&s;es formerly u&s;ed is not ea&s;ily di&s;covered; not above three &s;pears could come into contact, and the re&s;t &s;eems an idle depth, expo&s;ed to the arrows of the enemy. This theme mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to mili|tary men; and it is doubtful if the materials be &s;ufficient for preci&s;e inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t eminent or &s;kilful peers who were pre&s;ent com|manded the grand divi&s;ions, commonly four, the right and left wings, the center and re&s;erve. Under them the &s;maller barons acted as inferior officers, in feudal gradation, and often by hereditary right.</P>
<P>In &s;ieges cannon now began to be u&s;ed, in&s;tead of the &s;ows, battering rams, and other engines, the reliques of Roman &s;kill. But no memorable &s;iege happening after the acce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="165" REF="180">of the hou&s;e of Stuart, and the Scots having been &s;ingularly deficient in this art, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate the topic.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks &s;hall be clo&s;ed with an ab&s;tract of the agree|ment, in the beginning of June 1385, between the earl of Carric and other peers, and Jehan de Vienne the leader of the French forces in Scotland. It bears that they &s;hall march towards the borders on the twenty third of July, and &s;hall lay &s;iege to &s;ome fortre&s;&s;es, but as battle is expected their &s;trength is not to be wa&s;ted in doubtful a&s;&s;aults: that none &s;hall pillage in advancing to the marches, but &s;hall pay for what they have, on pain of beheading; and all per&s;ons coming to the army to &s;ell victuals &s;hall be &s;afe: if any man &s;lay another, it is in|&s;tant death: if any common &s;oldier &s;trike a gentleman, he &s;hall lo&s;e his hand or ear; if one gentleman &s;trike another, ju&s;tice &s;hall be admini&s;tered by the captains. In riots between the French and Scots, the bye&s;tanders mu&s;t &s;eize the guilty, who if knights are to lo&s;e hor&s;e and armour, if commoners a hand or an ear; the like penalty for tho&s;e who &s;hall di&s;lodge their companions, or di&s;order the march. All Scots and French are to wear, before and behind, a white cro&s;s of St. Andrew; if the armour be white, it mu&s;t be borne on a &s;quare, or a circle, of black cloth. If any Scot in&s;ult a Frenchman, he is to be &s;eized by the French, and brought before a Scoti&s;h chief; and &s;o in the contrary. He who un|hor&s;es an Engli&s;hman is to have half his ran&s;om. None &s;hall &s;et &s;ire to a church, kill a woman or a child, or commit rape, on the penalty above mentioned of knight and common &s;oldier. The pri&s;oner &s;hall belong to that captor who fir&s;t received his plighted hand; if taken from him the captain &s;hall order re&s;ti|tution; if the pri&s;oner be killed a rea&s;onable ran&s;om &s;hall be allowed. All &s;afe conducts granted by Vienne &s;hall be ob&s;erved by the Scoti&s;h lords and captains; and the French

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> Agriculture, U&s;eful Arts.</HEAD>
<P>ON the&s;e topics only a few brief illu&s;trations occur. Though Scotland was already denuded of wood, as before evinced, it was not owing to the progre&s;s of agriculture. James I or|dered that each poor per&s;on who ought to be a labourer, &s;hould either be the half proprietor of one ox in the plough, or dig every day a &s;quare of &s;even feet of ground, a toil which ex|tended through the year mu&s;t not have been incon&s;iderable <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 7.</NOTE>. His &s;tatutes al&s;o ordain that every farmer, u&s;ing a plough of eight oxen, &s;hall &s;ow every year a firlot, or four Scoti&s;h pecks, of wheat, half that quantity of pea&s;e, and <HI>forty</HI> beans, under the penalty of ten &s;hillings to the baron <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. v. 14.</NOTE>. Oats and barley were almo&s;t the &s;ole crops; not only wheat but pea&s;e and beans were extremely rare, and <HI>pea&s;e-bannocs</HI> were till lately e&s;teemed the next regale to wheaten bread. The acts concerning wolves and rooks, and burning of heath at improper &s;ea&s;ons, need not be recapitulated. Stealers or peelers of green wood, breakers of orchards, de&s;troyers of rabbit warrens, and dove|cots, were all ju&s;tly puni&s;hed by this wi&s;e prince; who al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed a <HI>new extent</HI> or valuation of landed property <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Home, hi&s;t. law tracts, p. 416, &s;eq</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The frequent wars between Scotland and England, &s;ince the death of Alexander III, had occa&s;ioned to the former
<PB N="167" REF="182">country the lo&s;s of more than a century in the progre&s;s of civilization. While in England only the northern provinces were expo&s;ed to the Scoti&s;h incur&s;ions, Scotland &s;uffered in its mo&s;t civilized departments. It is apparent that, in the reign of Alexander III, the kingdom was more abundant in the u&s;eful arts and manufactures, than it was in the time of Robert III.</P>
<P>When James I concluded the commercial treaty with Flan|ders, it is highly probable that he invited Flemi&s;h arti&s;ans to &s;ettle in his dominions. With his admirable talents for go|vernment, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that he could overlook the ad|vantages of a plan certainly pur&s;ued by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Boyce, f. 365, affirms that James I procured Flemi&s;h arti&s;ts; but a con|jecture is better than his authority. From Bowar, 505, it appears that James delighted in the mechanic arts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Yet the evidence concerning u&s;eful arts and manufactures continues barren. In a &s;tatute of 1428 ma&s;ons, carpenters, &s;miths, taylors, weavers, are mentioned <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 18.</NOTE>; and perhaps one or two others <HI>crafts,</HI> as cordiners, or the like, may be omitted. The weavers were apparently &s;olely employed in coar&s;e linens, and perhaps &s;ome woolen &s;tuffs. But while Ireland from its Engli&s;h &s;ettlements exported the latter, Scotland had certainly no manufactured export <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The Dittamundi te&s;tifies the export from Ireland of <HI>&s;aie,</HI> &s;ays, or thin woolen &s;tuffs.</NOTE>.

<P>THE grand emporia of commerce at this period were Venice. England, Flanders, and the Han&s;e Towns. Venice in parti|cular concentrated the commerce of the ea&s;t and &s;outh; and Flanders that of the we&s;t and north. Hence the extreme opulence of the Netherlands, and the rapid progre&s;s of their u&s;eful and luxurious arts. To them almo&s;t the whole Scoti&s;h trade was confined: &s;ome voyages to Norway, Denmark, and one or two of the Han&s;e Towns, and &s;ome to France for wines, formed perhaps the only varieties.</P>
<P>The imports from Flanders extended, as has already ap|peared from Froi&s;&s;art, even to the commone&s;t nece&s;&s;aries. The exports by the account of pope Pius II, were hides, wool, &s;alt-fi&s;h, and pearls <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Scotland was long celebrated for pearls.

Herring, fre&s;h, &s;alted, and red, are al&s;o mentioned. <HI>Talch</HI> or tallow is forbidden to be exported.</NOTE>.

<P>The merchants often went abroad with their cargoes; but none was permitted to u&s;e this privilege, except he were worth three <HI>&s;erplaiths</HI> of wool, each &s;erplaith being eighty &s;tone weight, or about two &s;acks <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 7.

<P>Campvere does not appear to have been the &s;taple port, till after the marriage of its lord to a daughter of James I. The Dam or Am&s;terdam, Sluys, Bruges, are mentioned as the places of re&s;ort; and in the latter city James I founded a Scoti&s;h chapel, to be &s;upported by &s;ome duties on ve&s;&s;els <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Acts J.

<P>In the old manu&s;cripts of our laws tho&s;e concerning &s;hipping appear, certainly not later than the reign of the fir&s;t James; but they throw no light on commerce.

They are merely private regulations, pro|bably Engli&s;h, and compo&s;ed at Berwick, which, when &s;hips were of fifty tons, a&s;pired to be a port; and even &s;o late as the reign of James V demanded to be con&s;idered as the &s;taple for all Scoti&s;h &s;almon imported into England <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">MS.

<P>Dome&s;tic traffic was chiefly carried on at fairs, an amiable and u&s;eful invention of the Roman catholic &s;uper&s;tition. They were commonly held on the day of the &s;aint to whom
<PB N="170" REF="185">the pari&s;h church was dedicated, and &s;ometimes on &s;undays.

<P>Yet the defect of indu&s;try in agriculture, pa&s;turage, and manufactures, occa&s;ioned as above mentioned a great balance again&s;t Scotland, and affected the coinage, which till the year 1355 had been equal in name, weight, and purity, to the Engli&s;h. In a parliament of June 1385, it was ordered that the moneyer &s;hould i&s;&s;ue coin of &s;terling purity, either from bullion, foreign money, or va&s;es and other plate; and render out of the pound weight of &s;ilver twenty-nine &s;hillings and four pennies, or in other words three hundred and fifty-two pennies. Tho&s;e who bring blanks of France are to have the &s;ame weight, except the lo&s;s of &s;ix blanks in the pound. The Engli&s;h noble of &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence is ordered to go for &s;even &s;hillings and eight pence Scoti&s;h: the French crown of 47 deniers for 42 Scoti&s;h pennies; and that of Flanders for 47 and a half-penny; while the French mouton is to bear 50. The exportation of money, by &s;ea or land, is prohibited, on pain of forfeiting the &s;um, and even the life of the offender to be in the king's power; except foreign merchants who bring corn, wine, boards, or the like nece&s;&s;aries, who may export their profits <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Regi&s;ter, f. 74.</NOTE>.

<P>IN the middle ages the hi&s;tory of literature is intimately connected with that of the church; and it is a &s;ingular rever&s;e of chance and time when literary men, them&s;elves the prie&s;ts of the mu&s;es, become enemies of their predece&s;&s;ors the prie&s;ts and monks, who&s;e influence was only that of knowledge over ignorance. During tho&s;e barbarous times, when &s;cience was neglected, and force alone reigned, a literary man could not
<PB N="172" REF="187">pur&s;ue his &s;tudies, except in a mona&s;tery: and there is rea&s;on to believe that many cordially de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;uper&s;titions which they profe&s;&s;ed, and had, like the ancient philo&s;ophers, their exoteric doctrine for the people, and their e&s;oteric for the learned: at lea&s;t this &s;eems the mo&s;t rational way of account|ing for the pre&s;ervation of many cla&s;&s;ics, and works of phi|lo&s;ophy, little accordant with the chri&s;tian purity, and doctrine; and for &s;ome minute but &s;ingular circum&s;tances, in &s;everal &s;culptures and manu&s;cripts of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>That chri&s;tianity had an eminent effect in the progre&s;s of civilization, it would be ab&s;urd to deny. Its enemies a&s;&s;ert that it introduced only new motives of di&s;cord, pro&s;cribed all vigour of intellect by the imbecility of belief, excited innu|merable wars of religion, (a contradiction in terms almo&s;t unknown to the ancient world,) murdered millions for any ab&s;urd dogma; and even by the &s;everity of its doctrines, tended to vitiate or madden mankind, unable to ob&s;erve laws repug|nant to their nature. But &s;uch are human affairs that no eminent advantage can be produced, without great concomi|tant di&s;a&s;ters; and the objections proceed upon a fallacious ground, as being e&s;timated from a partial view of the influ|ence of chri&s;tianity in civilized times, in&s;tead of a general retro&s;pect of its influence on barbarous nations and periods. The tenets of the ancient philo&s;ophers had been confined to a few individuals; but the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem was diffu&s;ed through all ranks of men; and its progre&s;s into the northern kingdoms is marked by the fir&s;t dawn of &s;cience, and civilization. It was in it&s;elf a &s;y&s;tem of education; and thus accompli&s;hed what no conque&s;t, intercour&s;e, nor form of government, could have &s;upplied; and even where its fir&s;t &s;teps are marked with blood, the temporary evil produced a la&s;ting benefit, by abo|li&s;hing the con&s;tant wars and &s;laughters of &s;avage life, and the
<PB N="173" REF="188">immolation of human victims to deformed idols.

<P>The privileges of the Scoti&s;h church are often confirmed in the &s;tatutes, but are no where preci&s;ely enumerated. They &s;eem to have been an exemption from tribute and war, and from the &s;entence of a temporal judge: a judicial authority in the &s;piritual cau&s;es of tithes, te&s;taments, matrimonial and heretical affairs: freedom to let lands and tithes: &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to no foreign church, but to the pope alone: a power of holding provincial councils for the regulation of the national church. In benefices the pontiff had only the right of con|firmation and deprivation, and the purcha&s;e of any benefice at Rome was &s;trictly prohibited. The bi&s;hops were elected by the chapter, and the royal recommendation &s;eems &s;eldom to have intervened. Abbots were cho&s;en by the monks alone; the &s;ecular clergy were named by the proprietors of the lands <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">The&s;e clergy were either par&s;ons, (rectors,) or vicars. Many were in the appointment of the bi&s;hops, and of collegiate bodies, who&s;e chapters they formed. Hence the lay patronage was much confined. The parochial anti|quities of Scotland have been little explored; but the number of pari&s;h churches &s;eems to have encrea&s;ed &s;ince the reformation. It appears, from the foundation charter of the collegiate church of Dunbar, that a vicar's &s;alary was about ten marks &s;terling, or about &s;eventy pounds modern currency.</NOTE>.

<P>Winton gives a &s;ingular tale, unknown to other writers, concerning the appointment of a bi&s;hop of St. Andrews. In the year 1399 Walter Daniel&s;ton, par&s;on of Kincardin O Neil in Aberdeen&s;hire, by &s;ome means took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle of Dunbarton. Three years after, on the death of Trial bi&s;hop of St. Andrews, Thomas Stuart brother to the king was elected by the chapter, but not confirmed by the pope; and Daniel&s;ton offered to &s;urrender Dunbarton, if the &s;ee were affigned to him. The terms were accepted by Albany: but Daniel&s;ton only &s;urvived this &s;trange tran&s;action half a year <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">MS. 886.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>James I introduced the Carthu&s;ian order into Scotland: he found the Benedictine and Augu&s;tinian monks &s;o relaxed in their di&s;cipline, that he wrote a letter of exhortation on the &s;ubject to their abbots and friars <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 508.</NOTE>. After a lap&s;e of near a century, a general council of the Scoti&s;h clergy was held at Perth in 1420; but its regulations are of little moment. Another council met Antony bi&s;hop of Urbino in February 1437, but the king's death prevented any procedure <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Innes E&s;&s;ay, II, 587. Bowar, 502.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ma&s;s, pilgrimages, and preachings, formed the great objects of devotion. Bowar di&s;plays the virtue of the ma&s;s, in &s;aving three monks of his mona&s;tery, who were bringing ale in a boat that was lo&s;t, with a credulity worthy of the ninth century <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Cont.

Sermons in the vulgar tongue were not only delivered by the preaching friars, but by &s;uch of the bi&s;hops, and other &s;ecular clergy, as were capable. At the coronation of Robert III, 1390, Thomas bi&s;hop of Galloway preached the &s;ermon <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Winton, 860. The homilies in latin were for the clergy, and for publi|cation: but &s;ermons in the vulgar tongue &s;eem to have continued in all ages. The Anglo-&s;axon homilies are innumerable: and the practice might be evinced from contemporary writers of all centuries, in France and other countries. Des Ur&s;ins in particular often mentions &s;ermons, being him&s;elf an archbi&s;hop.</NOTE>. An idea of the&s;e &s;ermons may be drawn from tho&s;e at the opening of Engli&s;h parliaments: latin &s;entences from &s;cripture were mixed with declamations in the language of the country.</P>
<P>Schola&s;tic divinity continued to be regarded as the chief branch of literature: an idle &s;tudy, in which the powers of the human mind were con&s;umed in mere di&s;putation concern|ing ideal words, while things were neglected or unknown. The acutene&s;s wa&s;ted on quiddities, entities, and other ab|&s;urdities, might if applied to life, manners, or real &s;cience and philo&s;ophy, have made important di&s;coveries: but &s;uch is man, ever ready to abandon the important realities before him, and eager in pur&s;uit of barren vi&s;ions. Till the univer|&s;ity of St. Andrews was founded in 1412, the Scoti&s;h youth de&s;igned for the church were chiefly educated at Paris and Oxford <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t profe&s;&s;or&s;hips at St. Andrews were for School-divinity, canon-law, philo&s;ophy and logic: the profe&s;&s;ors Lindoris, Cornel, Shevis, Gill, &amp;c.

He al&s;o compo&s;ed a genealogy of the kings of Scotland, from the fa|bulous Brutus of Geffrey of Monmouth, down to Robert II inclu&s;ive; and endeavoured to render the new dyna&s;ty more illu&s;trious by poetical embelli&s;hment. This work is lo&s;t; but we learn that he derived the Stuarts from Wales, and from Fleance de Waran, and fell into unchronological errors which Bowar points out, about &s;ixty years after the appearance of this ideal genealogy, an offering of flattery on the altar of loyalty <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Barbour's Bruce, London 1789, pref. p. xix.

His work was however little known, till it was republi&s;hed with large additions by Walter Bowar in the reign of James II. Thomas Barry, canon of Gla&s;gow, and fir&s;t provo&s;t of the collegiate church of Bothwell, wrote a long latin poem, in various kinds of rime, on the battle of Otterburn, 1388.

<P>THE &s;tate of the arts was not &s;o mean as may be imagined. Architecture, in particular, began to a&s;&s;ume all the richne&s;s, of which the Gothic &s;tyle is &s;u&s;ceptible. To the credit of Robert II and III it may be remarked, that no religious foun|dation is a&s;cribed to them; and the revenues of the crown were keeped &s;acred from &s;uper&s;tition. Of the latter prince it is recorded, that when Annabella his queen endeavoured to per&s;uade him to erect a magnificent tomb for him&s;elf, he an|&s;wered, with his accu&s;tomed piety and humility, that he would prefer the meane&s;t &s;epulchre, as more proper for one of the wor&s;t of kings, and greate&s;t of &s;inners <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 440.</NOTE>. The foundation of
<PB N="178" REF="193">mona&s;teries had, in the preceding century, remarkably &s;ub|&s;ided. The wealth of the monks had rendered them volup|tuous, illiterate, and remi&s;s in their duties, &s;o that even the ma&s;&s;es for the founders appear to have been uncelebrated. Hence a new &s;pecies of religious foundation became fa&s;hion|able in the fifteenth century, that of collegiate churches or provo&s;tries, &s;o named becau&s;e the &s;uperior was &s;tyled provo&s;t. The &s;ecular canons, or prebends, formed a body at the college church, occupied in divine &s;ervice, and &s;inging ma&s;&s;es for the founders, while their vicars &s;erved their re&s;pective pari&s;h churches. The&s;e collegiate edifices, with &s;ome foundations for the Ob&s;ervantines, a branch of the Franci&s;cans or Gray Friars remarkable for au&s;terity, pre&s;ent the mo&s;t certain and genuine &s;pecimens of eccle&s;ia&s;tic architecture at this period; &s;uch as Dunbar, Bothwell, Botham, Cor&s;torphin <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Spotti&s;woode, Religious Hou&s;es.

<P>The larger ca&s;tles continued to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by one or two exterior walls, and a court in the centre of which &s;tood a large and high tower, or donjon. Some there were which approached to more modern architecture, being built around a central court, and only fortified with a ditch and draw|bridge. Every <HI>laird</HI> or country gentleman had his <HI>fortalice,</HI> or tower, a lofty edifice with &s;mall windows, &s;urmounted by a flat &s;tone roof and battlements, and &s;ecured by a ditch. In towns the few chief hou&s;es had more of the modern &s;tyle, fortification being unnece&s;&s;ary while the town was guarded by a wall and ditch.

<P>In painting it is probable that no native arti&s;t aro&s;e, though James I was him&s;elf an eminent calligrapher, illuminator, and painter in miniature <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 505.</NOTE>. But Venice had already introduced many arts from Con&s;tantinople, and in the current of com|merce had imported them to Flanders.

And Sir Piers Courtenay, an Engli&s;h knight, royal champion, and brother to the pri|mate, wearing on his &s;leeve an embroidered falcon, with this motto,

<P>OF the reign, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1437</NOTE> now about to be de&s;cribed, no original and authentic hi&s;tory remains; and at a period when we might expect a light &s;o &s;trong, as to illuminate the minute&s;t features of action, and of character, a kind of twilight &s;ur|rounds us, in which only a few large objects can be di&s;cerned. The acts of parliament, and other records, pre&s;ent unque&s;|tionable evidence; but it is not in the fixed formality of &s;uch writings that the mo&s;t intere&s;ting details of hi&s;tory are to be found; and any regular epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence concerning
<PB N="187" REF="202">public affairs Scotland cannot di&s;play, till towards the end of the reign of James IV. The&s;e remarks are introduced to &s;olicit &s;ome indulgence for this particular part of the narra|tion; in which however no labour &s;hall be &s;pared to recover authentic facts, and to place them in a di&s;tinct point of view <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Bowar, the continuator of Fordun, terminates his hi&s;torical labours with the death of James I. The &s;canty original materials, for the reign of the &s;econd James, are chiefly the brief notices at the end of Bowar's work, p. 518&mdash;52c, and the hi&s;tory by John Mair, Paris 1521, Edin. 1740, 4to. p. 322&mdash;326, his injudicious narrative of Engli&s;h affairs abridging the real object of his work. Hector Boyce clo&s;ed the fir&s;t edition of his fables, 1527, with the death of James I: and happy had it been for our hi&s;tory, if he had not written the reign of James II at great length; which, after circulating in MS. and being tran&s;lated, (with the interpolation of two large pa&s;&s;ages after mentioned,) by Lind&s;ay of Pit&s;cottie, was publi&s;hed in the &s;econd edition of Boyce's hi&s;tory by Ferrerius, Paris 1574. Not only has Lind&s;ay tran&s;lated Boyce's fabulous account, but Le&s;ley and Buchanan have been contented to abridge it, without corrections, or new facts. In this reign only will Boyce be occa&s;ionally quoted, and with much he&s;itation.

<P>A parliament being called at Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 Mar.</NOTE> the fir&s;t object was the coronation of the young king, now only in the &s;ixth year of his age, and which was &s;olemnized on the twenty-fifth day of March, then reputed the fir&s;t day of a new year <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 26.

<P><PB N="188" REF="203">In our defect of con&s;titutional information it is not to be di&s;covered by whom this parliament was &s;ummoned. Late writers a&s;&s;ert that this high privilege was exerted by the officers of &s;tate; but their duty certainly expired with the decea&s;ed &s;overeign, and the &s;acred truth that &s;uch officers belong to the nation is a modern di&s;covery. The &s;ame authors carele&s;sly inform us that the government was divided, by the parliament, between Sir William Crichton the chancellor, and Sir Alex|ander Living&s;ton appointed keeper of the king's per&s;on. Both accounts &s;eem more than doubtful. There is every rea&s;on to believe, from the repeated oaths of fidelity ordered by James I to be taken to his queen, and from other circum&s;tances, that the late monarch had, by his te&s;tament, appointed the queen regent, with a cho&s;en council <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The contemporary MS. on the death of James I a&s;cribes the puni&s;hment of the regicides to the queen, an indication that the chief power was in her hands.
<P>Of the MS. annals of this reign by Sir James Balfour a tran&s;cript has been obtained; but they are of little value, and chiefly abridged from Boyce's hi&s;tory. He mentions the following per&s;ons as the council of regency; Sir William Crichton, Archibald earl of Douglas, William lord Hay, great con&s;table, James lord Lind&s;ay, Walter Haliburton, trea&s;urer, James Kennedy bi&s;hop of St. An|drews, Henry Lighton bi&s;hop of Moray, Mr. William Trumbull, keeper of the privy-&s;eal. Living&s;ton as keeper of the king's per&s;on Sir James regards as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the chief authority: but this council is probably from &s;ome record, as he dates its election 27th March. Yet Kennedy was not bi&s;hop of St. An|drews till 1440; the bi&s;hop of Moray was John Winche&s;ter; Lighton was bi&s;hop of Aberdeen. (Keith's Bi&s;hops.) So much for Sir James's accuracy.</P>
<P>From Scot&s;tarvet's Calendars the following officers appear towards the begin|ning of this reign: Sir William Crichton, chancellor; Alexander Living&s;ton, <HI>lord</HI> of Calendar; James Living&s;ton, captain of Stirling ca&s;tle; William Trum|bull, keeper of the privy-&s;eal; Sir Robert Lauder of Edrington and Ba&s;s, ju&s;ticiary; John Rail&s;ton, &s;ecretary; Richard Craig, director of chancery; Walter Haliburton, trea&s;urer; John Shevis, clerk of regi&s;ter; Nicol Ottirburn, official of Lothian.</P></NOTE>: that the parliament was called by the regency: and that Crichton and Living&s;ton were not
<PB N="189" REF="204">indebted to the national council for their power, but derived it from the will of James I. It is mo&s;t improbable that a proud ari&s;tocracy &s;hould have for&s;aken their preten&s;ions, upon this great occa&s;ion: but that the late king &s;hould have appointed two gentlemen of reputed wi&s;dom and integrity, in oppo&s;ition to the dangerous ambition of the nobles, is concordant with his character, and highly credible. A &s;imilar &s;eries of events en&s;ued to tho&s;e which occur in the minority of James V: the &s;pirit of the nation, and of the times, was little adapted to the conduct of a female hand, not only feeble, but expo&s;ed to ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion, becau&s;e the queen was a native of England, between which country and Scotland had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted either open enmity, or inveterate jealou&s;y. Finding that her power could not command confidence, nor influence, &s;he &s;oon &s;hrunk from it; and left Crichton and Living&s;ton to maintain their turbulent elevation.</P>
<P>An open war with England had taken place before the death of James I, and the &s;pirit of that prince was not &s;uch as to &s;olicit peace; but the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Scotland, under the di&s;tractions of a minority, rendered a treaty de&s;ireable. After &s;ome negotiation, <NOTE PLACE="marg">18 Sept.</NOTE> a &s;afe conduct was granted, by Henry VI, to John bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, Alexander Seton of Gordon, Sir Walter Ogilvy, and Sir John For&s;ter, as emba&s;&s;adors from Scotland <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Rymer, X, 677.

<P>If we credit the doubtful accounts which we have of this reign, Crichton had found means, probably by the &s;uperior influence of his office, as chancellor, to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the infant king, whom he retained in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh. The queen, favouring the ju&s;t claim of Living&s;ton, by a &s;tra|tagem obtained, and conveyed her &s;on to Stirling, and delivered him to the care of his legal guardian. The chancellor applied to Archibald earl of Douglas for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which was de|nied: Living&s;ton inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; but he and the chancellor agreeing to join again&s;t Douglas, concord was re&s;tored <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Boyce, lib.

<P>There cannot be a &s;tronger proof of the ignorance of our carlier writers, concerning this reign, than their a&s;&s;ertion that the powerful earl of Douglas was neglected, while it is known, from authentic records, that he held the high office of lieute|nant general of the kingdom, <NOTE PLACE="marg">27 Nov.</NOTE> and even &s;ummoned a parlia|ment <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Aberc. II, 319, from MS. records.</NOTE>. In another national a&s;&s;embly it was ordered that the lord lieutenant, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1439 13 Mar.</NOTE> and the king's cho&s;en council, &s;hould hold two &s;e&s;&s;ions yearly for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice: and that the lord lieutenant &s;hould &s;eize any rebels, or de&s;poilers, lodged in ca&s;tles, or &s;trongholds, and enforce them to find &s;urety for their good behaviour <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 26.</NOTE>. But Archibald earl of Douglas died this year; and was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on, a youth who&s;e years
<PB N="191" REF="206">did not exceed fourteen, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1439</NOTE> and were too immature to &s;upport the dignities of his father <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Boyce and Lind&s;ay date the death of Douglas in 1439. His epitaph, Hume's Dougl. I, 267, bears that he died the 26th June 1438: but three origi|nal deeds confute this date, Aberc. II, 319, and &s;hew that for M.CCCC.XXXVIIII (1439) Hume read 1438; or, as not unfrequent, an erroneous date might occur in an epitaph, if placed long after the event.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Meantime petty feuds and commotions de&s;troyed the public peace and welfare: the flood of ari&s;tocratic tyranny and vio|lence, which had been confined by the &s;tern government of James I, bur&s;t the temporary barriers, and deluged the country.</P>
<P>Joanna, the queen-mother, married Sir James Stuart, com|monly called the Black knight of Lorn: the barbari&s;m of the age rendering it un&s;afe for a woman of rank to remain without the protection of a warlike hu&s;band. But Sir James Stuart being a friend to the family of Douglas, as is &s;aid, Living&s;ton confined him, and his elder brother, and even the queen, till they engaged not to &s;upport the hou&s;e of Douglas. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1440</NOTE> The fruit of Living&s;ton's in&s;olence was that the chancellor, by another &s;tratagem, recovered the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the king's per&s;on, and conveyed him to Edinburgh. But, by the mediation of friends, a la&s;ting agreement was at length formed between them; and the king was committed to Living&s;ton's care, as ordered by his decea&s;ed father <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Boyce, lib.

<P><PB N="192" REF="207">However this be, it is certain that a parliament was held at Stirling <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 26.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Aug.</NOTE> in which it was decreed that the privileges of the clergy &s;hould be ob&s;erved: that the admini&s;trators of ju&s;tice &s;hould hold their &s;e&s;&s;ions twice a year: and, by a remarkable act, that "the king &s;hould ride through the realm, imme|diately upon intelligence being &s;ent to his council, wherever any rebellion, &s;laughter, burning, robbery, outrage, or theft, happened; to call the &s;heriff of the &s;hire, wherein the crime was committed, before him, and before he leaves the &s;hire to remedy the mi&s;chief and puni&s;h the offenders; in the execu|tion of which ordinance all the barons, with one a&s;&s;ent, are obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 5.</NOTE>."

<P>The power of the hou&s;e of Douglas had ari&s;en to a formi|dable height, and was during this reign to contend with the royal authority. Galloway, Annandale, and other exten&s;ive territories in Scotland, the duchy of Touraine and lord&s;hip of Longueville in France, rendered to the chief of that family revenues perhaps equivalent to tho&s;e of the Scoti&s;h monarch. The young earl, now in his &s;ixteenth year, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the im|petuous &s;pirit, and haughtine&s;s, natural to his age and fortunes.

The prudence of age might have induced a concealment of pomp, and power, from the fear of envy, and danger; but, in the arrogance of youth, William earl of Douglas di&s;played a con&s;tant train of one thou&s;and hor&s;e, and a dazzling magnificence in his hou&s;ehold; nay he would even create knights, and hold courts in imitation of parliaments <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Boyce, lib.

<P>The chancellor, who, by his office, was chiefly charged to &s;ee the due execution of the laws, was irritated at the in&s;ults offered to them by the power of Douglas. In&s;tead of bearing with the young earl's in&s;olence, in the hopes that a few years would infu&s;e moderation and prudence into his conduct; in|&s;tead of &s;ecretly u&s;ing the king's influence with the court of France, that the foreign titles and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions might be with|drawn from the family, Crichton re&s;olved to cut off the earl, and his brother; a mea&s;ure which might perhaps have admit|ted &s;ome apology, had they been advanced to maturer age, for it &s;eems &s;trictly equitable that an oppre&s;&s;or, who is above the procedure of ju&s;tice, may be &s;acrificed to the laws, with|out any procedure of ju&s;tice; but which, while we con&s;ider the tender age of the offenders, mu&s;t be pronounced unju&s;t, murderous, and tyrannical.

The earldom of Douglas fell to the next male heir, James lord of Abercorn, &s;urnamed the Gro&s;s, a prudent and peaceable man, but who unfortunately enjoyed his title only two years, and left a turbulent &s;on William, the third of that name: the un|entailed e&s;tates of Galloway, Wigton, Balvenie, Ormond, and Annandale, were inherited by Margaret, &s;i&s;ter of the murdered earl, commonly called The Fair Maid of Galloway, who wed|ded her cou&s;in the third William, thereby re&s;toring the hou&s;e of Douglas to all its power <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Yet James the Gro&s;s held the&s;e titles, or his epitaph is again erroneous.

The want of wi&s;dom in the government, upon this occa&s;ion, exceeds belief; but it is ea&s;ier to commit a murder, than to perform an action of common prudence, and crime ought never to infer ability.

<P>The king now approached his fourteenth year, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1444</NOTE> when, by the u&s;age of mo&s;t kingdoms, he was regarded as capable of managing his affairs: the perturbation of a minority, flattery, and the danger of oppo&s;ing the royal will, as &s;oon as the &s;lighte&s;t degree of manly thought appears, concurring to &s;up|po&s;e in princes, who&s;e &s;tation is the mo&s;t difficult, a far more early di&s;cretion than is to be found in the common ranks of mankind. That reign mu&s;t indeed be very weak, which tran&s;cends not the inefficacy, and di&s;turbances of a regency. By the common cour&s;e of human affairs, the young king de|te&s;ted the control of Living&s;ton and Crichton; and the nu|merous friends of the hou&s;e of Douglas were &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;harpening his re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e &s;tern guardians, who had held him in captivity, and in turning his affections to the earl of Douglas, who&s;e youth was more congenial with that of the king, and who&s;e power could irre&s;i&s;tibly enforce the royal de&s;igns. It is &s;aid that Galbraith, a parti&s;an of Douglas, having &s;lain Semple deputy governor of Dunbarton ca&s;tle, and &s;eized the whole command of that fortre&s;s, Douglas became anxious for the event, and proceeding to the king's pre&s;ence, put him&s;elf wholly in the power of James, with profe&s;&s;ions and oaths of the humble&s;t fidelity: and that the monarch, de|lighted with his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and behaviour, admitted him to his

Douglas u&s;ed his new power with an ex|ce&s;s, dangerous to the king, and to him&s;elf. In a &s;hort time all the followers of the late admini&s;tration were di&s;placed, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors devoted to the pre&s;ent mini&s;try were appointed: three brothers of Douglas &s;oon became peers <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">James and Archibald were twin brothers of the &s;econd birth.

<P>The &s;ingular fate of this prince&s;s may excu&s;e a digre&s;&s;ive note, from the original materials furni&s;hed by Duclos, III, 26&mdash;61, being the informations taken in Oct. 1445, and in 1446, concerning the cau&s;e of her death. The&s;e informations purport that certain words &s;poken by the malicious Jamet de Til|lay, an officer of the dauphin, had penetrated &s;o deeply the tender and melan|choly heart of Margaret, as to occa&s;ion her death. Their truth &s;he denied on the perdition of her &s;oul; but &s;he would recline on her &s;ofa, and exclaim, Ah Jamet! Jamet! you have gained your purpo&s;e. If I die it is on your account, on account of the fair words you have &s;poken of me, without cau&s;e or rea&s;on. At other times &s;he would &s;ay, May I die if I ever wronged my hu&s;band! The &s;ene&s;chal of Poitou, pre&s;ent when the latter expre&s;&s;ion e&s;caped, exclaimed, Fal&s;e and wicked &s;coundrel, &s;he dies by your malice! On her death-bed her confe&s;&s;or could hardly per&s;uade her to pardon Jamet: and &s;he cried out, Now he has gained his purpo&s;e. The words, &s;he &s;aid, were the wor&s;t that could be pronounced of a woman, and tended to ruin her in the opinion of the dauphin. Almo&s;t her la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion was, Were it not for my conjugal faith, I &s;hould re|pent that I had ever come to France.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd examination in 1446, May&mdash;Aug. Jamet de Tillay was twice que&s;tioned; and the queen of France her&s;elf gave a depo&s;ition. Tillay con|fe&s;&s;ed that, on entering the chamber of the dauphine&s;s in the du&s;k of the even|ing, and perceiving to lights, he &s;aid it was <HI>grande paillardie</HI> in the officers to &s;hew &s;uch negligence; denied that he accu&s;ed lady Pregente of managing Mar|garet's amours, as he would not wi&s;h more cha&s;tity in his own wife, than he was per&s;uaded belonged to the dauphine&s;s; and he offered the duel to any man who would &s;ay that he had arraigned her honour: denied that he a&s;&s;erted that Margaret's illne&s;s aro&s;e from love, while he only &s;aid that it proceeded from her &s;itting up all night, making rondeaux and ballads, (44, 52;) and that &s;he would never have a child while &s;he was &s;o fond of &s;our apples and vinegar. He de|nied that he &s;aid the dauphin did not love his wife becau&s;e "les ba&s;&s;es marches ne &s;e portoient pas bien." The queen's depo&s;ition proves Tillay to have been a malicious meddling fellow, capable of any fal&s;ehood. His &s;econd examina|tion bears that Margaret would compo&s;e twelve rondeaux in a day; that &s;he &s;ometimes was laced too tight, at other times too loo&s;e. The fatal words at length appear to have been "Avez vous point vu cette dame-la? Elle a mieux maniere d'une paillarde que d'une grande maitre&s;&s;e." "Have you &s;een that lady? She has more the appearance of a harlot than of a great prince&s;s." He denied that he had &s;aid them, and offered the duel; a&s;&s;erting that no lady could have more of the appearance of high birth. But the words were confirmed by another witne&s;s, p. 59.</P>
<P>On the whole Margaret was too fond of poetry, and her adventure with Alain Chartier is well known; &s;he was too carele&s;s of her per&s;on and manners, and had perhaps a &s;ecret blemi&s;h which di&s;gu&s;ted the dauphin. But the character of her hu&s;band, afterwards Louis XI, is of black malignity; and her accu&s;er was proved to be a "&s;coundrel" and "common liar," qualities which doubt|le&s;s recommended him to the &s;pecial protection of Louis.</P></NOTE>: <NOTE PLACE="marg">16 Aug.</NOTE> but the French monarch received them

<P>Meanwhile the di&s;orders of the country encrea&s;ed, under the mi&s;management of Douglas, and cau&s;ed even the regency of Crichton and Living&s;ton to be regreted. Among the petty feuds, commemorated in our dubious annals, a di&s;cord of more importance is introduced. A di&s;pute ari&s;ing between Lind&s;ay &s;on of the earl of Crawford, and Ogilby of Innerquharity, the former was joined by his father, the latter by the earl of Huntley, and a de&s;perate conflict en&s;ued.

<PB N="202" REF="217">to have induced the king and Douglas to &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions: it was probably now di&s;covered by both that the aged experi|ence, and abilities, of Crichton were nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome &s;tability, and order, to government, and re&s;tore greater re&s;pect to the laws. Douglas &s;eems to have found that, by gra&s;ping all, he would lo&s;e all; and that the acce&s;&s;ion of Crichton's talents, and fame, would much &s;trengthen the power of his admini&s;tration. It al&s;o appears that Crichton had never been cordially united with Living&s;ton, but had from nece&s;&s;ity only con&s;ented to concord; and now when the death of the queen-mother had left Living&s;ton de&s;titute of &s;trong influence, he ungenerou&s;ly made his peace with Douglas, by the &s;acrifice of his colleague. It has &s;urpri&s;ed &s;ome that Douglas &s;atiated his revenge upon Living&s;ton and his family, who were innocent of the murder of his two relations; and that Crichton was never charged with that a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination: but it is rea&s;onable to infer that there were powerful motives for this conduct; the king him&s;elf had been pre&s;ent at the murder, and in the jealou&s;y of his authority might con&s;ider it as a matter rather too delicate for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; Douglas might have had little in|clination to condemn an action, which laid the foundation of his power; and the intention of which was perhaps not un|known to his father, who might otherwi&s;e have immediately in&s;tigated the whole force of the hou&s;e of Douglas again&s;t the government <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Yet the violence of Living&s;ton to the queen in 1439, (&s;ee a note on that year,) indicates the tyranny of his character; and he might be the chief in&s;ti|gator of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the Dougla&s;es.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The earl of Douglas was, about this time, created lieutenant general of the kingdom <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Abercr. II, 333. The Acts, f. 28, mention a lord lieutenant in 1449.</NOTE>; an office of extreme power, which had been held by one of his predece&s;&s;ors at the commencement

He now re&s;olved upon the perdition of the family of Living&s;ton, which had only done its duty to the king and kingdom, by oppo&s;ing the exorbitant influence of the hou&s;e of Douglas.

<P><PB N="204" REF="219">Ravages of &s;uch importance called greater powers into action; <NOTE PLACE="marg">1448</NOTE> and the battle of Sark, &s;o called from a river in An|nandale, terminated the difference in a manner advantageous to the Scots. Unfortunately we have no Engli&s;h, nor Scoti&s;h contemporary account of this battle, the only one which occurs between the nations for a long period of time. When at the di&s;tance of near a century we find records of this action, the Engli&s;h pa&s;s it in complete &s;ilence, and the Scots too much &s;well their victory. The accounts of Jean Chartier, and Mon&s;trelet, &s;eem to de&s;erve the preference; but even there the number appear to be exaggerated. According to the French hi&s;torians, the Engli&s;h, to the number of fifteen thou|&s;and, conducted by the earl of Huntinndon and lord Percy, apparently wardens of the marches, entered Scotland by the we&s;tern border, and advanced &s;ix miles into the country. The earl of Douglas ha&s;tily advanced, with only &s;ix thou&s;and, attacked the enemy in the open field; conquered, and took the two generals captives. Upon the tidings of this defeat, the earl of Sali&s;bury, who was lord lieutenant of the north of England, rai&s;ed an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and, and &s;ent this for|midable force to invade Scotland. Douglas, and his brother Ormond, with thirty-two thou&s;and men, attacked the Engli&s;h by &s;urprize, and put them to a total route; with the incredible lo&s;s of between twenty and twenty-four thou&s;and, taken and

<P>Mon&s;trelet, III, f. 8, edit. 1518, derives his account from the great chronicle of St. Denis; and &s;ays that three Scoti&s;h prie&s;ts of the dioce&s;e of Dunblane, related it upon oath before the chronicler of France at St. Denis. He dates it 1449; but the truces of that year, and the &s;ilence of Rymer in 1448, &s;upport the date commonly a&s;&s;igned by our hi&s;torians. The battle of Sark al&s;o occurs, Cont. of Bowar, 519; and the war between England and Scotland in Jean Chartier, p. 142, who, p. 146, narrates the battle of Sark in the &s;ame way with Mon&s;trelet, but with many corroborative circum&s;tances.

<P><PB N="209" REF="224">The victories of Douglas had afforded little compen&s;ation to Scotland for his tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, which &s;eemed to in|crea&s;e in proportion to the continuance of his power. For him, and his followers, there was no law, and the country groaned under the mo&s;t de&s;tructive anarchy. But the &s;ix heavy years of his authority were &s;oon to expire; and different circum&s;tances were already preparing to le&s;&s;en his influence. The charms and &s;en&s;e of the queen began to infu&s;e a more manly character into her hu&s;band, to arou&s;e him from his lethargy, and to form a party capable of undermining the odious power of Douglas.</P>
<P>James II may now be &s;aid to have a&s;&s;umed a permanent character, of which the delineation &s;hall be here attempted, as far as barren and &s;canty materials will admit. His actions proclaim him a prince of deci&s;ive, and &s;ometimes even violent, &s;pirit. In war he was a valiant and popular leader; and &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed his father in a marked attention to military di&s;cipline. Negligent of pomp, the equal of every &s;oldier, he &s;hared the mean repa&s;t of the march, confident that poi&s;on is &s;eldom admini&s;tered in va&s;&s;els of wood, repo&s;ing ab&s;olute faith in the love of his people <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Mair, 326.</NOTE>. The power of his ablities, the excel|lence of his intentions in peace, are be&s;t di&s;played by the laws of his reign, always the mo&s;t in&s;tructive an valuable portion of hi&s;tory. His wi&s;dom appears con&s;picuous, in his reverence for the coun&s;els of the wi&s;e, in guiding his mo&s;t important actions by the experience of Crichton, and the benign and patriotic prudence of Kennedy. The perdition of the ari&s;tocra|tic and tyrannic hou&s;e of Douglas was to be a &s;pirited exertion of ju&s;tice to him&s;elf, and to his people. But that any fixed plan yet exi&s;ted, for the de&s;truction of the ari&s;tocracy, &s;eems a refined theory, incongruous with the ignorance and &s;pirit
<PB N="210" REF="225">and manners of the times; and is be&s;t confuted by the plain facts, that the families aba&s;ed are ever remarkable for im|portant crimes, and that the property, and power, which were withdrawn from one hou&s;e, were ever to be be&s;towed on another. Even when Louis XI, and Henry VII, were, to|wards the termination of this century, in countries of greater civilization, and political &s;cience, to humble the ari&s;tocracy, an unprejudiced reader will be ready to infer that the events proceed rather from chance, and circum&s;tances, and the rota|tion of &s;ociety, than from de&s;ign. As to the per&s;on of the &s;econd James, we only know, that it was robu&s;t; and that a red tinge, which deformed one of his cheeks, gave him the vulgar appellation of James with the fiery face <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Mair, 322.

<P>The truce with England had been, in May, renewed for a very &s;hort time; and among the commi&s;&s;ioners named to prolong it, in September, we find Living&s;ton, who had been again taken into favour, and appointed ju&s;ticiary of Scotland: a circum&s;tance which appears to pre&s;ent a proof that the in|fluence of Douglas was much on the decline.

<P>One of the la&s;t traces of the power of Douglas occurs in the decrees of a parliament, held at Edinburgh, this year, and
<PB N="211" REF="226">probably in the early part of it. The &s;heriffs are therein or|dered to cau&s;e re&s;titution be made of any &s;tolen effects: if they &s;hould refu&s;e, or be negligent, or partial, the complainant is to apply to the king's lieutenant, who is to puni&s;h the &s;heriffs as if they were the robbers: and they are to be treated as tho&s;e who di&s;obey the king's acts, given under the royal &s;eal, and decreed by the lieutenant, and the three e&s;tates <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 28, 20 Jan. 1449, regni 13&mdash;1450. Yet this parliament, being di&s;tinct in the acts from that of Jan. 1449-50, &s;eems to belong to 1449.</NOTE>. It would appear, from this ordinance, that the office of lieutenant ge|neral of the kingdom wanted little of being a &s;ole regency.</P>
<P>This dangerous dignity certainly fell, &s;oon after the marriage of the king: and Douglas retired from the court, attended with the execrations of the people. It is &s;aid that Sir Richard Colville, having &s;uffered repeated injuries from Auchinleck, a follower of Douglas, thought he might now venture upon revenge; which he completed in the &s;laughter of his enemy. Douglas, irritated at this in&s;ult offered to his fallen power, ravaged the lands of Colville, be&s;ieged his ca&s;tle, took it, and left not one inhabitant alive <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Boyce, lib. XVIII, Lind&s;ay's tran&s;l. 54.</NOTE>. That age, in the true &s;pirit of chivalry, prai&s;ed the earl's exertion of friend&s;hip: at pre&s;ent this action appears in its real colours, as a &s;anguinary revenge, as a contempt of ju&s;tice, as an in&s;ult to the laws, and to &s;o|ciety; and as peculiarly di&s;graceful to him who had been the &s;econd magi&s;trate in the kingdom.</P>
<P>The commencement of the king's active authority was &s;ignalized by a memorable parliament, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1450 Jan.</NOTE> held at Edinburgh, in which a great number of &s;alutary regulations were i&s;&s;ued <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 28&mdash;31. This may be the &s;ame with the former; but is here, f. v. 28, dated 19 Jan. 1449.</NOTE>. It is ordained that a general peace be proclaimed through all
<PB N="212" REF="227">the realm, &s;o that all men might travel in &s;ecurity, without any protection, &s;ave that of the king's peace; and if any &s;ub|ject &s;tand in fear of another he may have <HI>borrowes of peace,</HI> that is a pledge for his good behaviour: that ju&s;t, and able, judges be appointed: that the ju&s;ticiary &s;hall pa&s;s twice through the country in the year, as ordered by the ancient laws: that any rebellion again&s;t the king be puni&s;hed according to its nature, and by the advice of the three e&s;tates; and if any openly rebel, or make war upon the king's &s;ubjects, in defiance of his prohibition, the king &s;hall advance again&s;t them with the whole force of the land, if nece&s;&s;ary, and puni&s;h them according to their de&s;erts. The&s;e unu&s;ual ordinances &s;uffi|ciently paint the di&s;orders, into which the bad admini&s;tration of Douglas had thrown the kingdom. Other &s;tatutes decree, that if any per&s;on a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hall be brought to ju&s;tice, he &s;hall be puni&s;hed equally with the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors: that the warden of the marches &s;ee that the truce be &s;trictly ob&s;erved, and appoint &s;uch officers as he &s;hall an&s;wer for: that admi|ni&s;trators of law, who wilfully tran&s;gre&s;s, &s;hall lo&s;e their office for a year, and be fined: that de&s;poilers be compelled to make full, and &s;peedy, re&s;titution, pay all expences, and a fine to the king: that the ju&s;ticiary or ju&s;tice general, the chamber|lain, the coroners, and other officers obliged to travel through the country, have but a moderate attendance, that they may not annoy the people: that fore&s;tallers of corn be puni&s;hed, and the corn forfeited to the king; and that even the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of grain keep no more than is nece&s;&s;ary for their annual con&s;umption, and &s;ell the remainder in open market at the current price.</P>
<P>Above all, one remarkable act of this parliament de&s;erves attention, being conceived in the following terms. "It is ordained that if any man, as God forbid, commit or do trea&s;on
<PB N="213" REF="228">again&s;t the king's per&s;on, or his maje&s;ty, or ri&s;e in war again&s;t him, or lay hands upon his per&s;on violently, of whatever age the king be, young, or old; or receive any that have com|mitted trea&s;on, or that &s;upply them with help or advice, or garri&s;on the hou&s;e of them who are convicted of trea&s;on, and hold their hou&s;es again&s;t the king, or garri&s;on hou&s;es of their own in a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the king's rebels, or that a&s;&s;ault ca&s;tles, or places where the king's per&s;on &s;hall happen to be, without the con&s;ent of the three e&s;tates, &s;hall be puni&s;hed as traitors <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 30, c. 25.</NOTE>." This &s;tatute has occa&s;ioned altercations between the favourers of monarchy, and tho&s;e who attach ideas of freedom to a par|liament of the middle ages, when the only di&s;pute lay between monarchy and ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>It was further ordained that all the regalities, in the royal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be judged by the king's ju&s;ticiary; and the freeholders of &s;uch regalities &s;hould appear in parliament, equally with tho&s;e of the royal domains <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. As many large e&s;tates had fallen to the crown, in the preceding reign, this mea&s;ure &s;eems intended to increa&s;e the king's influence in parliament: and &s;uch was the &s;pirit of the times that, to in|crea&s;e the power of the &s;overeign, was to enlarge the freedom and happine&s;s of the people, labouring under the wor&s;t tyranny, that of a feudal ari&s;tocracy. Other prudent &s;tatutes concern the puni&s;hment of robbery, the regulation of the coin, and the penalties of contumacy again&s;t the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. 29, 31.</NOTE>. Such laws &s;hine like a coru&s;cation amid the night of barbari&s;m; but, it is believed, imparted little of vital heat to the political atmo&s;phere. It is ea&s;y to form good laws: the difficulty lies in the execution. The chief felicity of a nation is to have few laws, and to be accu&s;tomed to obey them.</P>

The monarch trembled at this confederacy, the power of which was in fact &s;uperior to the royal authority; but he re&s;olved to di&s;&s;emble for a &s;ea&s;on,
<PB N="217" REF="232">though the nation, in a ju&s;t alarm, already beheld the king dethroned, and the country pa&s;&s;ing, from ari&s;tocratic tyranny and di&s;cord, into a &s;ubjection to foreign dominion.</P>
<P>An incident however &s;oon occurred, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1452</NOTE> which ha&s;tened the execution of the royal vengeance. Douglas had per&s;uaded or overawed mo&s;t of his va&s;&s;als, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in Galloway, Kyle, Carrick, Cunningham, and the di&s;tricts adjacent, into an engagement of attendance, and aid, even again&s;t the &s;ove|reign him&s;elf. But a few of the more moderate, and prudent, were aver&s;e to &s;uch illegal ties; and among the&s;e was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Maclelan, guardian of the heir of Bomby, and a near relation of Sir Patrick Gray, who was &s;on of lord Gray, and captain of the king's guard, an office of the greate&s;t confi|dence <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Among &s;ome &s;light variations, Lind&s;ay has in&s;erted this &s;tory in his tran&s;|lation of Boyce, p. 61&mdash;64, and its <HI>naif</HI> veracity is far remote from the manner of Boyce. In p. 81&mdash;87 is another &s;imilar interpolation, afterwards to be u&s;ed. The royal guard now appears for the fir&s;t time, perhaps in imitation of the Scoti&s;h guards of France e&s;tabli&s;hed about 1440.</NOTE>. The earl of Douglas, irritated at Maclelan's ob&s;ti|nacy in rectitude, &s;uddenly be&s;ieged his hou&s;e, took it, con|veyed the owner to the ca&s;tle of Douglas, <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Yet according to the fabulous Boyce it was demoli&s;hed in 1450.</NOTE> and threw him into &s;trict durance. Upon hearing this, Sir Patrick Gray laid the affair before the king, and in&s;tantly obtained a mild letter, rather of &s;upplication than of command, reque&s;ting Douglas to deliver the pri&s;oner to Gray. The earl was &s;itting at dinner in the ca&s;tle of Douglas, when he was told that Gray, a familiar &s;ervant of the king, was at the gate; and, in &s;ome &s;urprize, aro&s;e to receive him with much apparent civility, and invited him to partake of the repa&s;t. During the enjoy|ments of the table, Douglas was revolving what Gray's com|mi&s;&s;ion could be; and gue&s;&s;ing the truth gave a &s;ecret order,
<PB N="218" REF="233">in con&s;equence of which the pri&s;oner was led to a green be&s;ide the ca&s;tle, where his head was &s;truck off, and taken away, and a cloth was &s;pread over the body. The meal ended, Gray produced the royal letter, which was received with all the re&s;pect of fraud; and the earl having peru&s;ed it &s;aid, "I am beholden to you for bringing me &s;o gracious a letter from the king, e&s;pecially con&s;idering how matters &s;tand be|tween us at pre&s;ent. The demand &s;hall in&s;tantly be granted, and the more favourably for your &s;ake." He then took Gray by the hand, and led him to the green, where removing the cloth, Douglas coldly &s;aid: "Sir Patrick, you are come a little too late. This is your &s;i&s;ter's &s;on, but he wants the head. Take his body, and do with it what you will." Gray replied in angui&s;h, "My lord, &s;ince you have taken his head, you may di&s;po&s;e of his body:" then calling for his hor&s;es he mounted, and &s;aid to the earl, "My lord, if I live, you &s;hall be rewarded for your pre&s;ent labour, according to your demerits." Douglas, enraged at this threat, called for his hor&s;e; but Sir Patrick by the goodne&s;s of his led &s;teed e&s;caped the pur&s;uit, which ex|tended near to Edinburgh.</P>
<P>The king irritated beyond mea&s;ure at &s;uch repeated in&s;ults, aggravated by the mo&s;t &s;anguinary cruelty, and the mo&s;t pro|fligate contempt of the laws; and anxious to prevent the effects of the formidable league formed again&s;t his authority, called a cho&s;en council to deliberate upon the mea&s;ures to be followed. It was re&s;olved, in order to avoid the horrors of civil war, that Douglas &s;hould be inveigled into court by flattery, and upon pretence that the king forgave his pa&s;t enormities, and only de&s;ired him to reform his future conduct <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Boyce, lib. XVIII, Lind&s;ay, 64.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">22 Jan.</NOTE> About this time a pa&s;&s;port was obtained from the Engli&s;h king, for Douglas,

Douglas proudly refu&s;ed, and had the arrogance to upbraid the king with his procedures again&s;t him, which had forced him, as he a&s;&s;erted, to form this confederacy. The &s;en&s;e of repeated in&s;ults, and of an outrageous contempt of his authority, con&s;pired with the pre&s;ent per&s;onal affront, to kindle a flame of in&s;tantaneous fury; and the monarch exclaiming, "If you will not break this league, by God I &s;hall," drew his dagger, and &s;tabbed Douglas.

XVIII, Lind&s;ay's tran&s;lation 69, with Hume's Doug|la&s;es I, 366. But the events of 1452 are intermixed.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">autumn</NOTE></P>
<P>To under&s;tand this rebellion aright, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to throw a brief glance on the affairs of England. In the end of the preceding year Henry VI, a prince who&s;e weakne&s;s ren|dered his whole reign one minority, had fallen into a &s;tate of in&s;anity; and Richard duke of York had been &s;oon after de|clared protector of the realm. As James was ever firmly attached to Henry, and evinced on &s;ub&s;equent occa&s;ions an eagerne&s;s to &s;upport his intere&s;ts, there is rea&s;on to infer that York excited, or favoured, the rebellion of Douglas, in order to prevent James from an interference in the affairs of Eng|land. Nor in ca&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;s of Douglas, in driving James from his throne, would the example have been unu&s;eful to the de&s;igns of York; nor the &s;upreme power of Douglas in Scotland unimportant to his purpo&s;es. The intercour&s;e be|tween York and Douglas appears to have been mediated by Beatrix, the mother of the latter, and John lord Balveny his brother, who as is abovementioned had proceeded to England; and who were afterwards &s;pecially included in the forfeiture of the family, for de&s;igns on the Scoti&s;h monarchy &s;upported by Engli&s;h influence.</P>
<P>When to the aid of York are added the internal cau&s;es, the native ambition of the hou&s;e of Douglas, un&s;atiated even by
<PB N="225" REF="240">the highe&s;t honours of regal favour; its latent but deep en|mity, excited by the de&s;truction of two of its chiefs, during the pre&s;ent reign, and by other injuries and mortifications; its con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that no monarch could ever &s;incerely pardon a family, which formed one nur&s;ery of rebellion, which de&s;pi&s;ed the laws, and rivalled the throne; its apprehen&s;ions, from the recent ruin of its power in the north, that if effectual re&s;i&s;tance were not in&s;tantly oppo&s;ed, the annihilation of the &s;tem and other branches might follow; when the&s;e con&s;iderations are weighed, the &s;ources of this grand rebellion may not perhaps appear ob&s;cure. The inflammatory principles had long exi&s;ted, and were deeply and widely &s;cattered: the power of York, the money and protection of England, the overthrow of Moray and Ormond, and the con&s;equent &s;tings of apprehen&s;ion and revenge, were only temporary circum&s;tances, which &s;et fire to the train that &s;hook Scotland to its centre.</P>
<P>Such appear to have been the cau&s;es of this grand rebellion, which threatened to overturn the Scoti&s;h throne, and which our elder writers ignorantly con&s;ider as a prolongation of that which aro&s;e in 1452, on the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of William earl of Douglas; but which as is evident from original documents above adduced, was wholly extingui&s;hed in that year. Later writers have either followed their example, in confounding di&s;tinct events; or have, under the general term of England, blended the remote, and oppo&s;ite, intere&s;ts of York and of Henry. They al&s;o tell us that, &s;oon after the death of the former earl, Beatrix his mother, and Margaret the fair maid of Galloway his widow, took refuge in England: that Doug|las accepted the emba&s;&s;y, in the view of &s;ecuring the hand of Margaret, who&s;e domains were large; and, in order to obtain a di&s;pen&s;ation, he afterwards procured a &s;afe conduct for a
<PB N="226" REF="241">pretended pilgrimage to Rome <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">The &s;afe conduct is for four years; and might be intended as a re&s;ource in ca&s;e the rebellion failed; and whether Henry or York &s;hould happen to be in power.</NOTE>. That a di&s;pen&s;ation being refu&s;ed, he neverthele&s;s wedded Margaret, who in di&s;gu&s;t fled to the Scoti&s;h king; and he be&s;towing her in marriage on his uterine brother Athole, the con&s;equence was a civil war. But there is no evidence that James now earl of Douglas wedded his brother's widow: or that &s;he returned to Scotland before the ruin of the family. The &s;ame writers, who &s;tate this affair as the origin of the war, al&s;o a&s;&s;ert that Douglas and his brothers were, in July this year, &s;ummoned before a parliament, to an&s;wer for their crimes; and upon nonappear|ance, were declared rebels and forfeited. This latter circum|&s;tance would of it&s;elf pre&s;ent a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of the commo|tion: but the difficulty in the account of the&s;e authors con&s;i&s;ts in di&s;covering what new crimes the hou&s;e of Douglas had committed; and the act of forfeiture, 1455, is infallibly the fir&s;t and &s;ole act again&s;t the family, as is clear from the records.</P>
<P>The facts and authorities, about to be adduced, will be found unanimous in the &s;upport of the previous ob&s;ervations above given. Nor is there any evidence that James had plan|ned the ruin of the potent family of Douglas, as theoretic writers would infer; for he was unprepared, and trembled at the impending danger. The in&s;trument of Augu&s;t 1452, the honourable emba&s;&s;y of the following year, indicate complete reconciliation; and though embers of jealou&s;y might at this &s;ea&s;on be revived, by the ruin of Moray and Ormond, and by the king's interference in fru&s;trating the earl's de&s;ign to wed his brother's widow, yet the ambition of Douglas, joined with
<PB N="227" REF="242">the other cau&s;es above mentioned, will to a candid mind ap|pear the chief &s;prings of this memorable conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Unfortunately there is not, for its commencement in the autumn of this year, that clear evidence which attends its termination in the next. The fir&s;t events re&s;t upon doubtful and inaccurate authorities, the u&s;e of which nece&s;&s;ity alone can vindicate; and all that can be done is to &s;elect the mo&s;t im|portant, and probable, circum&s;tances, omitting &s;uch as are contradicted by the genuine records of the en&s;uing year.</P>
<P>It appears that James, di&s;covering the trea&s;onable corre&s;|pondence carried on by Douglas in England, and &s;u&s;pecting his de&s;igns, &s;ent an herald to &s;ummon him to appear before the privy council, or perhaps the parliament. Far from &s;hewing obedience that potent earl &s;ent &s;ecret me&s;&s;engers to affix, in the night, placards upon the church-doors of Edin|burgh, charging the king with the murder of the two chiefs of the hou&s;e of Douglas, and replete with in&s;ulting expre&s;&s;ions <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Boyce lib. XVIII, Lind&s;ay's tran&s;l. 70.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly a&s;&s;embling a &s;mall array, James ravaged &s;ome lands belonging to Douglas. It being the time of harve&s;t, the king not only felt repugnance in de&s;troying the corn, but could not, except in the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity, harra&s;s his &s;ubjects by a&s;&s;embling a large force: he therefore returned; and, di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing a part of his followers, he ordered the remainder to be&s;iege Abercorn, a &s;trong ca&s;tle belonging to Douglas, and which, from its proximity to the capital, was an object of pe|culiar jealou&s;y <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Yet the &s;uddenne&s;s of the attack on his domains had &s;o much alarmed Douglas, who little expected &s;uch promptitude, that he withdrew to the borders; whence he &s;ent lord Hamil|ton
<PB N="228" REF="243">into England to reque&s;t York's a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and a &s;um of money was immediately remitted <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Boyce, lib. XVIII, Lind&s;ay 81.

<P>The circum&s;tances of Douglas were now reduced to that cri&s;is, that the only choice lay between a bold exertion of his whole &s;trength, in the ardent execution of great and extreme mea&s;ures, or a patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to total ruin. Reinforced by the pecuniary &s;upply from England, by the imagined fidelity of va&s;&s;als long oppre&s;&s;ed, by the martial influence of that name, which a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of heroes had rendered the trumpet of war, he re&s;olved to oppo&s;e his power in the open field to that of the king. The armed force, that would ari&s;e at the call of Doug|las, was e&s;timated at forty thou&s;and men; mo&s;t of them from their &s;ituation near the borders, and con&s;tant exerci&s;e in fight, far &s;uperior to any other troops of Scotland.</P>
<P>James had &s;ent the earls of Orkney and Angus, with &s;ix thou&s;and men, to be&s;iege the ca&s;tle of Abercorn, when Doug|las &s;ummoned all his force to meet him at Douglas, on the tenth day, with provi&s;ion for twenty days, to pa&s;s with him to Abercorn, there to re&s;cue the fortre&s;s; or give the king battle, and force him to fight, or to leave the kingdom. Surprized at this intelligence, the king ju&s;tly di&s;tru&s;ting the &s;outh of Scotland, the chief &s;eat of the power of Douglas, pa&s;&s;ed in a &s;hip to St. Andrews; and his de&s;pair even &s;ugge&s;ted to him an intention to abandon Scotland. But the prudent and re&s;pect|able bi&s;hop of that &s;ee, James Kennedy, a &s;on of the counte&s;s of Angus daughter of Robert III, in&s;inuated motives of con|&s;olation, and of courage. By his advice the king i&s;&s;ued pro|clamations, &s;ummoning the array of the north, and offering amne&s;ty to all who &s;hould now join his &s;ervice: and in a few days a con&s;iderable force arrived; the royal banner was rai&s;ed
<PB N="229" REF="244">in St. Andrews; and the army marched to Falkland in order of battle. Entering Stirling, attended by the barons of Fife, Strathern, and Angus, James remained there, till the more northern troops &s;hould approach; and, upon their junction, he found him&s;elf at the head of forty thou&s;and men. He then advanced again&s;t Douglas, who&s;e army, amounting to near forty thou&s;and, (among whom Hamilton, at the head of three hundred hor&s;e, and as many cho&s;en infantry, was to render him&s;elf remarkable,) had encamped on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Carron, in his march towards Abercorn.</P>
<P>A battle was believed inevitable, which was to decide whe|ther James, or Douglas, &s;hould have the dominion of Scot|land. But bi&s;hop Kennedy, anxious to prevent the effu&s;ion of blood, had attended the royal army, and now &s;ent a &s;ecret me&s;&s;age to Hamilton, his nephew, a&s;&s;uring him, in the king's name, not only of remi&s;&s;ion, but of high reward, if he would leave Douglas. Hamilton returned rather a favourable an&s;wer, yet he&s;itated between the laws of friend&s;hip, and the advantages of loyalty, when the haughtine&s;s of Douglas con|&s;pired to induce him to embrace the latter. A herald, arriving from the king, charged the rebels to di&s;per&s;e, under pain of trea&s;on: Douglas &s;ent him back with deri&s;ion; and imme|diately arrayed his ho&s;t and marched towards the royal army; but &s;eeing its &s;trength, and doubting the effect of the proclama|tion of amne&s;ty, nay thinking that he perceived its influence in the dubious &s;ervice, and fallen &s;pirit of his people, he con|ducted them back into their camp, hoping to reanimate their fidelity and courage, before he led them to battle in the morn|ing. This imprudent procedure was little approved by the barons, and leaders, e&s;pecially by Hamilton, who immediately went to the earl, and inquired if he intended to give the king battle, or not; affirming at the &s;ame time that the delay was
<PB N="230" REF="245">full of danger, as his people were de&s;erting while the royal army was upon the increa&s;e. Douglas an&s;wered, with con|tempt, "If you are tired, you may depart when you plea&s;e;" and Hamilton, that night, pa&s;&s;ed to the king. The other chiefs alarmed at his departure, and &s;u&s;pecting each other, al&s;o di&s;banded; &s;o that in the morning Douglas trembled when he beheld a &s;ilent and de&s;ert camp, not one hundred men remain|ing, be&s;ides tho&s;e who belonged to his hou&s;ehold, or were his immediate &s;ervants. Upon this unexpected change, the earl fled to Annandale, where he lurked with his brothers till the en&s;uing &s;pring. In this &s;urprizing manner fell for ever the enormous power of the hou&s;e of Douglas; which had ari&s;en from patriotic heroi&s;m; and was conducted to perdition by ari&s;tocratic tyranny, and the mo&s;t ungrateful rebellion.</P>

<P>The national council, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1458 6 March</NOTE> being &s;ummoned to Edinburgh, di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf by enacting a great number of prudent laws. The ordinance of the year 1456, concerning the &s;upreme court of judicature, was revi&s;ed; and it was decreed that the &s;e&s;&s;ions were only to continue for forty days at a time, but &s;hould be held three times in the year, at three different cities, Edinburgh, Perth, and Aberdeen; that is once a year at each place, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods. This court con&s;i&s;ted, as has above appeared, of committees of parliament; and, from a &s;pecification in the act, it &s;eems that the Scoti&s;h parliament did not now exceed one hundred and ninety members <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Each committee con&s;i&s;ted of nine members, three clergymen, three barons, three burge&s;&s;es: the&s;e di&s;tinct committees in the year amount to twenty-&s;even members; and the act bears that, on this plan, the judicial capacity of each member would not revolve above once in &s;even years, which infers a total of one hundred and eighty-nine.</NOTE>. The rotation of the&s;e committees of ju&s;tice was a laudable mea&s;ure, and partook more of a free con&s;titution, than the foundation of James V, origin|ally projected by John duke of Albany, on the model of a French judicatory parliament, after de&s;poti&s;m had tainted the government of France. This in&s;titution al&s;o contributes &s;ome|what to in&s;truct us how a French parliament dwindled into a court of law. Particular regulations were enacted, concerning the cau&s;es to be tried by this court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and the mode of
<PB N="240" REF="255">procedure: <NOTE PLACE="marg">1458</NOTE> but it is unju&s;tly, and impoliticly, ordered that the members &s;hould defray their own expences. Other acts con|cern the regulation of the coin, of the ho&s;pitals, and of military di&s;cipline, particularly for the encouragement of archery. A curious &s;umptuary law appears, which &s;hall be re&s;erved for future con&s;ideration: and one common rate of mea&s;ure is ordered to be followed through the kingdom. The decrees for the promotion of agriculture de&s;erve applau&s;e; they ordain that lands may be let in fee-farm, and that the king &s;hall &s;et the example; that woods, trees, and hedges, be planted; that wheat, peas, and beans, be regularly &s;own; game is recommended to pre&s;ervation; wolves, and birds of prey, to de&s;truction. A decent and peaceable attendance on the courts of ju&s;tice is enforced: the violent &s;eizure of lands is guarded again&s;t: he who attains the royal remi&s;&s;ion is, neverthele&s;s, to make com|pen&s;ation to the plaintiff for any robbery or &s;poil: negligent, or corrupt, officers of ju&s;tice are to lo&s;e their office, and profits, for a year and a day, if heritable; if not, for ever <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 39.&mdash;f. v. 45.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The famous &s;tatute of James I is confirmed, concerning <HI>lea&s;ing making,</HI> or the propagation of fal&s;ehoods between the king and the people <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. 45, c. 100.</NOTE>; a law perhaps not de&s;erving of much blame, during the &s;truggles between monarchy and ari&s;tocracy, but which afterwards became an oppre&s;&s;ive engine of &s;tate. Two other acts particularly regard the con&s;titution; by the one it is wi&s;ely ordained that no leagues or bonds of a&s;&s;ociation be entered into, nor any commotions rai&s;ed, under the pain of confi&s;cation, and even the life of the guilty to be in the king's mercy; and that, under the &s;ame penalty, no inhabitants of boroughs &s;hall engage in bonds of attendance; or ride in armour, &s;ave with the king, his officers, or the lord of the
<PB N="241" REF="256">borough. The other act declares that no freeholder, that holds of the king a property of le&s;s value than twenty pounds a year, be con&s;trained to come to the parliament or general council, as a member, except he be a baron, or be commanded by the king's officer or writ <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 43, c. 88, and f. 43, c. 85.</NOTE>. This ordinance, really intended as a relief of the &s;ubjects at a period when attendance on parliament was regarded as a burden&s;ome expence, and lo&s;s of time, has been con&s;trued into an intention of undue influence.</P>
<P>The patriotic exertions of this la&s;t parliament of James II are terminated with a decree, that the proper officers order its &s;tatutes to be copied and proclaimed through the kingdom, in order that none may pretend ignorance. The members con|clude with an affecting peroration, to the effect that, &s;ince God has &s;ent their &s;overeign &s;uch pro&s;perity, that all rebels and infringers of ju&s;tice are bani&s;hed, and no party able to excite commotion remains in the realm, if the king and his mini&s;ters be inclined to the quiet and utility of the &s;tate, and to di&s;pen&s;e ju&s;tice and equity among the people, the parliament therefore exhorts, and requires, the monarch diligently to enforce the&s;e &s;tatutes, that he may meet with the approbation of heaven, and of all his &s;ubjects; and expre&s;&s;es gratitude to God, who has &s;ent them &s;uch a prince to be their governor and defender <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. 45, c. 102.</NOTE>. Alas, two &s;hort years were to clo&s;e their hopes, and their gratitude! A fatal chance was again to reduce Scotland to the confu&s;ions of a minority, and to retard the civilization, and the glory, of that ill-fated kingdom. That the happine&s;s of millions &s;hould depend upon the infancy of one, is a paradox in human affairs, which may provoke the &s;miles of tho&s;e who think, and the tears of tho&s;e who feel. But &s;uch in&s;tances &s;eldom occur, and mu&s;t be &s;uffered, to avoid greater evils. Severe however,

<P>A commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued to Sir William Monipeny of Rattray, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov.</NOTE> and Mr. John Kennedy provo&s;t of St. Andrews, to proceed on an emba&s;&s;y to France, and demand the earldom of Xaintonge, which had been granted to James I.

<P>In the deficiency of hi&s;torical materials, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1460</NOTE> it is not ea&s;y to di&s;cover the pretences, or cau&s;es, which induced James to break the truce by be&s;ieging Roxburgh. It is certain that, in June, he &s;ent emba&s;&s;adors to England, to confirm the truce, and to compo&s;e any &s;light infringements, which might have
<PB N="243" REF="258">occurred &s;ince its commencement <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XI, 453.</NOTE>: and that, on the third of Augu&s;t, he was &s;lain. That, in the conte&s;t between the families of York and Lanca&s;ter, the Scoti&s;h monarch inclined to the latter is to be inferred from his per&s;onal relation, by the mother, with the families of Somer&s;et and Gaunt, and from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance lent by the French king, his ally, to Henry VI; and is a&s;certained by the treaties when Henry maintained his authority, and the intervals of war when York was in power, and by the flight of Henry, and his queen, into Scotland. The ca&s;tle of Roxburgh was in the cu&s;tody of William Nevil, lord Fauconberg, of the hou&s;e of Warwick, the chief pillar of York's honourable cau&s;e <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Calendars of ancient charters, 38 H 6, p. 281.</NOTE>. It appears therefore that the emba&s;&s;y of June, which con&s;i&s;ted of not le&s;s than two bi&s;hops, three abbots, and three peers, had far &s;uperior intentions to tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ed in the commi&s;&s;ion; and was &s;ent to promi&s;e aid to Henry, upon certain previous terms, probably that Rox|burgh and Berwick, held by the enemies of Henry, &s;hould be re&s;tored to Scotland, if taken by James. On the tenth of July the Lanca&s;trians had been defeated at Northampton, and Henry reduced to captivity; an event which &s;eems in&s;tantly to have excited the Scoti&s;h monarch to arms, and he proceeded to &s;ecure the conce&s;&s;ions in the fir&s;t place, as not only a nece&s;|&s;ary object of prudence upon his part, but as affording a di&s;|traction to the arms of York, or a motive to their blame, by holding them out to the Engli&s;h as the origin of national di&s;|a&s;ter, and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Accordingly, toward the end of July, James, with a nu|merous army, well furni&s;hed with cannon, and warlike ma|chinery, proceeded to the &s;iege of Roxburgh ca&s;tle; which had ever &s;ince the battle of Durham remained in the hands of

The Scoti&s;h money was now to the Engli&s;h as one to three; and the Scoti&s;h &s;ilver penny became a mo&s;t diminutive coin, &s;o that it could not be cut into quarters, or farthings, as formerly: for the benefit of the poor, this par|liament decreed that billon farthings, of copper mixt with a &s;mall portion of &s;ilver, &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued, being the fir&s;t example of that coinage in Scotland <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 46&mdash;f. v. 47.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Among the &s;ingular incongruities of human affairs, may be cla&s;&s;ed the fortune of the third James. His feeble and ty|rannic reign was, in its commencement, graced with the capture of Roxburgh, the reddition of Berwick, and the im|portant annexation of the Orkneys to the Scoti&s;h monarchy; any one of which events would have reflected honour on the able reigns of his father, or grandfather. Let us then abandon the maxim, that political prudence, and &s;ucce&s;s, are the &s;ame. The acqui&s;ition of the Orkneys forms an incident, &s;o remark|able in it&s;elf, and attended with &s;uch la&s;ting con&s;equences, that no apology need be offered for entering into &s;ome detail upon this intere&s;ting &s;ubject.</P>
<P>That the Orkneys were con&s;idered as a part of Pikland, till the Norwegians &s;eized them, with the Hebudes, in the ninth

The Norwegian line of earls failed about the year 1330, in the per&s;on of Magnus V: and the earldom pa&s;&s;ed, by female &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to Malis earl of Strathern <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">His right is rather ob&s;cure, but it appears to have been by marriage.

The undoubted &s;uperiority however re&s;ted with the kings of Denmark, to which Norway had been annexed &s;ince the year 1387; they continued to give the inve&s;titure; and, on the failure of heirs, or any pretext of rebellion, or neglect of allegiance, might have re&s;umed the property.

After &s;ome negotiation, the commi&s;&s;ioners of Denmark and Scotland at length appeared at Paris, in the year 1460, in the pre&s;ence of the French king Charles VII.

The penalty, they affirmed, could not be incurred as the treaty had not been in|fringed, but only neglected; and they even hinted that the long forbearance, on the part of Denmark, implied a pre|&s;cription. Charles, wi&s;hing to conciliate his allies, alledged the ab&s;ence of the orginal treaty as a ground of indeci&s;ion: but prudently recommended a marriage between the heir of Scotland, and the daughter of the Dani&s;h &s;overeign, as the be&s;t mean of terminating the difference. After &s;ome con|&s;ideration of this propo&s;al, the Scoti&s;h envoys, who appear to have had previous powers, a&s;&s;ented, upon condition, that the arrears of the annual &s;um payable for the Hebudes &s;hould be di&s;charged, and the payment for ever remitted: that the king of Denmark &s;hould abandon his right to the Orkneys and Shetland; and pay one hundred thou&s;and crowns for the de|coration of the royal bride.

<P>It was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Scoti&s;h government would neglect an object of &s;uch moment; and the king's approach to maturity recommended it to increa&s;ing attention.

<P>Chri&s;tiern I was one of the mo&s;t powerful monarchs who had ever held the Dani&s;h &s;ceptre. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the three northern kingdoms, and of the duchies of Sle&s;wick and Hol&s;tein, pious, prudent, liberal, and a lover of peace, he was regarded with veneration by the neighbouring princes, who con&s;tantly cho&s;e him as the arbiter of their differences. But the frequent tu|mults
<PB N="265" REF="280">of Sweden, and the repeated a&s;cents of Charles Canut&s;on upon the throne of that kingdom, one of which happened this year, joined with the &s;ums paid for the acqui&s;ition of Sle&s;wick and Hol&s;tein, had exhau&s;ted the penury of the Dani&s;h trea|&s;ure. No king of Denmark had ever rendered his influence &s;o much known in Europe, by foreign alliances; among which that formed with France again&s;t England was the chief: and a connection with Scotland, important in it&s;elf, was further recommended by mutual friend&s;hip and enmity. The&s;e circum&s;tances con&s;idered will abate any &s;urprize at the con|duct of Chri&s;tiern, in abandoning to Scotland the i&s;lands of Orkney and Shetland, remote and little profitable to Den|mark; and commanded by a Scoti&s;h family, of divided, and uncertain fidelity.</P>
<P>But to Scotland the proximity of the&s;e i&s;lands, and the uni|ver&s;al belief that they had anciently belonged to the monarchy, rendered their acqui&s;ition a matter of glory, and importance; not to mention their intrin&s;ic value, which was far from being incon&s;iderable. The Scoti&s;h emba&s;&s;adors, aware of the weight of their negotiation, conducted it with zeal and prudence; but could not prevaiol upon Chri&s;tiern to grant an immediate dere|liction of the Orkneys and Shetland; while his de&s;ire of the alliance, and his poverty, con&s;ented to impledge them for the greater part of his daughter's portion.

<P>The Swedi&s;h commotions continuing to con&s;ume the Dani&s;h revenues, the delay of the payment agreed on protracted the re&s;idence of the Scoti&s;h emba&s;&s;y at Copenhagen; and Arran returned to Scotland, to lay the terms before James; and ob|tain in&s;tructions concerning the conveyance of the bride <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Torf. 188.</NOTE>.

<P><PB N="268" REF="283">Amid the general joy, one family was lo&s;t in cares, and in all the remor&s;e of imprudent ambition.

During the la&s;t ab&s;ence of Arran, &s;uch influence had been exerted, that James had pa&s;&s;ed from extreme favour into a total alienation from that family; and it was natural that, as he advanced in years and intelligence, he &s;hould become inimical to a hou&s;e, which had &s;o gro&s;sly abu&s;ed his power and his youth.

Of Robert the &s;econd &s;on nothing is &s;aid; and it is &s;u&s;pected that the varying relations of Ferrerius and Buchanan originate from confounding him with Thomas earl of Arran. Though he ap|pear not to be mentioned in the trial, yet his voluntary exile may have followed the ruin of the family. Arran, according to Ferrerius, wandered from Den|mark to Germany, Venice, Naples, Tu&s;cany, where he was &s;lain by the hu&s;band of a woman, whom he attempted to debauch: according to Buchanan he went from Germany to France and Burgundy, and died at Antwerp, where a mag|nificent tomb was erected to his memory by Charles the Bold, who him&s;elf died in 1477. However this be, in 1470 or 1472, Arran was in England. John Pa&s;ton e&s;q in a letter to Sir John Pa&s;ton his brother, written, as Mr. Fenne the editor ob&s;erves, in one of the&s;e years, &s;ays "Al&s;o I pray you to recommend me, in my mo&s;t humble wi&s;e, unto the good lord&s;hip of the mo&s;t courteous, gentle&s;t, wi&s;e&s;t, kinde&s;t, mo&s;t companionable, free&s;t, large&s;t, and mo&s;t bounteous knight, my lord the Earl of Arran, which hath married the king's &s;i&s;ter of Scotland."

<P>The king, who had now nearly attained his eighteenth year, was, upon his marriage, regarded as arrived at the age of majority; and the reins of &s;tate were left entirely in his hands. His per&s;on was elegant, his mind weak. In attachment to favorites, in &s;uper&s;tition, in love of retirement, and literature, he not a little re&s;embled James VI. The other chief features of his character were avarice, caprice; and a delight in archi|tecture, mu&s;ic, and a&s;trology, too violent to leave room for the duties of a monarch. His aver&s;ion to the &s;everity of public bu&s;ine&s;s rendered the relaxation of his government obnoxious to the united evils of anarchy and tyranny: for, be&s;ides a fixed inclination to de&s;poti&s;m, his impatience of &s;low and moderate mea&s;ures prompted him to &s;udden acts of outrage; and his favorites oppre&s;&s;ed the people, while the indolence of the king abandoned the reins of ju&s;tice; and his lenity to the bad was cruelty to the good. His &s;ceptre was &s;o little &s;tained with blood, that the future fate of his brother may excite doubt, or a&s;toni&s;hment: yet oppre&s;&s;ion may proceed by rapid, though &s;ilent, &s;teps, while the fears and weakne&s;s of the &s;overeign con&s;train him to &s;hrink from &s;anguinary violence <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Compare Ferrerius, f. v. 390, Lind&s;ay, 115; Le&s;ley's account of this reign, for, contrary to his u&s;ual practice, he gives no general character.

It is unnece&s;&s;ary to add that the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly of the nation is here, for the fir&s;t time, put upon the mean and dependent footing of a mere court of ju&s;tice, exi&s;ting by the royal plea&s;ure; and a&s;&s;imilated, in terms of contempt, with the inferior courts <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 54, c. 46: <HI>continued</HI> is <HI>prorogued, adjourned.</HI> It is ri&s;ible to ob&s;erve Guthrie, amid much wi&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, pa&s;s the&s;e acts in &s;ilence, IV, 107; while, at a lo&s;s to find in&s;tances of the de&s;poti&s;m a&s;cribed to this king, he in|terprets as &s;uch, IV, 105, the fate of the Boyds, and the marriage of the king's &s;i&s;ter to Hamilton!</NOTE>.

<P>The youth of James, at this period, and the weakne&s;s he afterwards di&s;covered, lead to a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion that &s;ome fa|vorite mini&s;ter, or mini&s;ters, were the real authors of the de&s;potic procedure, which, during this reign, di&s;gu&s;ted all orders of men. But &s;o barren are &s;till our materials, concern|ing the internal government of the kingdom, that conjecture,
<PB N="273" REF="288">and probability mu&s;t &s;upply the defect of clear information. The power of the chancellor became, in this reign, yet more remarkable than at any prior period; and he now obtained the high di&s;tinction of a precedence next to that of the princes of royal blood <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Dr. Gilbert Stuart on the Public Law and Con&s;titution of Scotland, chap. iv, p. 32, edit. 1784.</NOTE>. In parliament he pre&s;ided, and di|rected the lords of the articles; and in fact the whole legi&s;la|tive body. This office during the far greater part of this reign, from 1460 to 1482, was filled by Andrew Stuart, lord Evandale, the natural &s;on of Sir James Stuart, &s;on of Murdac duke of Albany. It appears to be a novelty in our hi&s;tory that one &s;o nearly connected with the royal family, e&s;pecially when Evandale and his brothers were legitimated by the king's mandate in 1472, &s;hould hold this important office: and there is room to &s;u&s;pect that Evandale &s;acrificed his duty to the na|tion to the aggrandizement of the royal family, which he re|garded as his own. Be&s;ides this motive, other circum&s;tances con&s;pired to extend the prerogative during this reign, unhap|pily not upon the prudent plan, &s;oon after to be followed by Henry VII of England, in depre&s;&s;ing the nobles and rai&s;ing the people; but upon that already e&s;tabli&s;hed by Louis XI of France, in cru&s;hing the &s;pirit and freedom of the commons, with tho&s;e of the ari&s;tocracy. In Scotland the people never knew their own weight, and the government turned between ari&s;tocracy and de&s;poti&s;m; the nobles and the king commonly forgetting the nation, which de&s;erved the neglect while it &s;ilently abandoned its awful claim. But till James VI acceded to the Engli&s;h throne, and left the Scoti&s;h nobles at a great di&s;tance, and in a degrading inferiority, de&s;poti&s;m made but a &s;low progre&s;s in Scotland, and the chief evils aro&s;e from the ari&s;tocracy which prevented the progre&s;s of indu&s;try and civi|lization.
<PB N="274" REF="289">Yet the conduct of James III &s;eems to evince that the nation could have no rea&s;on to prefer the power of the king to that of the nobles; for the de&s;pot who pre&s;cribed de|grading laws, and expre&s;&s;ed open contempt for the nation, repre&s;ented in its legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, was yet more inimical than the ari&s;tocracy; which, even by its di&s;&s;en&s;ions, maintained, in &s;ome degree, the freedom, the vital current of the nation. A chief motive of the arbitrary procedure of James III appears to have ari&s;en from the temporary humiliation of the nobility; who, though &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of equal power, as they were after to &s;hew in the impri&s;onment and &s;laughter of their &s;overeign, yet were awed for a time by the ruinous examples of the hou&s;es of Douglas and Boyd. The contemporary reign of Louis XI <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">1460&mdash;1482. Buchanan, XII, 62, adds the cruel example of Edward IV of England 1460&mdash;1483, and the &s;ucceeding one of Richard III. In fact James appears to have been more attached to England than to France: nor is there a renewal of the French league from 1448 till 1492 recorded in Du Tillet, or the MS. Leagues. But the politics of James were in con&s;tant fluctuation. See 1484.</NOTE> &s;eems al&s;o to have corrupted the coun&s;els of James; for not only did the alliance with France introduce, at different times, many imitations of the French government and in&s;titutions into Scotland, but James &s;eems to have &s;elected Louis for his particular model: yet as a man of abilities never imitates, &s;o happily, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, abilities cannot be imitated. Crimes and faults may: and we behold Louis reflected, &s;o to &s;peak, by James, in the heavy &s;u&s;picion of a brother's blood, in contempt of the nobility, and in the choice of low favorites, in an appearance of devotion, in attachment to a&s;trology, in avarice, in a life of retirement and jealou&s;y, and in the love of arbitrary power. In their attention to &s;ome &s;ciences they were al&s;o &s;imilar; and the patronage of Louis to an ingenious foreigner, Galeotus Martius, is rivalled by that of James to
<PB N="275" REF="290">another, William Roger, the Engli&s;h compo&s;er of mu&s;ic <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Mezeray, Abr. III, 350. Ferrerius, f. v. 390.</NOTE>. But the &s;ucce&s;s of their political plans was very different. Louis, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by chance and circum&s;tances, laid the la&s;ting foundation of ab&s;olute power, levelled the nobility, cru&s;hed the people; and by di&s;continuing the &s;tates general annihilated national freedom. James wi&s;hed to e&s;tabli&s;h arbitrary govern|ment by the depre&s;&s;ion of the nobles, and the people; and by converting the national council, which neither his abilities nor his power would permit him to di&s;continue, into a mere court: but he forgot that neither his revenue, nor his authority, cor|re&s;ponded with his de&s;igns; and fell a &s;acrifice to the ari&s;to|cracy, who&s;e influence re&s;umed its former &s;way. The&s;e re|flections have been excited by the importance of the &s;ubject; but their prolixity having already exceeded the intention, it is proper to return to the narration.</P>
<P>After a &s;ilent year in the Scoti&s;h annals, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1471 6 May</NOTE> the fir&s;t object, which arre&s;ts attention, is another parliament, of which &s;ome ordinances de&s;erve hi&s;torical commemoration <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 55.</NOTE>. The &s;tatute of the la&s;t parliament again&s;t murder is enforced, and en|larged; that crime being again declared to have become com|mon. It is decreed, "con&s;idering the great poverty of the realm," that none &s;hall wear &s;ilk, the importation being &s;o expen&s;ive, except knights, min&s;trels, that is performers of mu&s;ic, and heralds, and tho&s;e worth one hundred pounds in the an|nual income of lands. Another &s;tatute &s;hews that the intere&s;ts of the country began to be &s;omewhat under&s;tood: it concerns the fi&s;heries, an object of repeated attention, and endeavours, for three centuries; and now, it is to be hoped, the &s;ucce&s;sful care of a patriotic &s;ociety. This remarkable act is conceived
<PB N="276" REF="291">in the&s;e terms: <NOTE PLACE="marg">1471</NOTE> "the lords <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">All members of parliament were denominated lords of parliament, as a commoner, or a private clergyman, if emba&s;&s;ador, was &s;tyled lord emba&s;&s;ador. So Dr. Magnus in the time of James V. The cu&s;tom is &s;till retained in "lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion," "barons of the exchequer."</NOTE> think expedient, for the common good of the realm, and the great importation of riches to be brought into the realm from other countries, that certain lords &s;piritual and temporal, and &s;ome burghs, cau&s;e equip large &s;hips, bu&s;&s;es, and other great pink-boats, with nets and all ne|ce&s;&s;aries for fi&s;hing: the execution of this object, and the form, and number, to be con&s;idered at the prorogation of this par|liament <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 57, c. 60.</NOTE>." But the &s;ubject was not re&s;umed: and the &s;cheme only excites a &s;igh at the con&s;ideration how ea&s;ily nations are excited to war, or any ruinous project, and with what extreme difficulty any plan of public benefit is carried into execution. Another prudent &s;tatute provides again&s;t the encroachments of the Roman church, now ari&s;ing to &s;uch enormity, as, in half a century, provoked the reformation, by prohibiting the clergy, under pain of trea&s;on, to procure any benefices from the court of Rome, not formerly held by the pope's di&s;po&s;al; or to collect more money for the papal trea&s;ury, than had been regulated by the antient taxation of Bagimont <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 56. Le&s;ley, 356, ridiculou&s;ly dates the taxation of Bagimont in 1512, in&s;tead of 1275.</NOTE>. In this act the clergy's title to free election of their dignitaries is men|tioned, and confirmed: but two years after we find that James de&s;poiled the pope only for his own purpo&s;e, and cru&s;hed even this mean relict of freedom. The monks of Dunfermlin having cho&s;en an abbot, the king probably won by a &s;um of money recommended another to the pope, obtained his confirmation; and this new tyranny became inviolable cu&s;tom <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Ferrerius, f. v. 392.

<P>Neverthele&s;s the Scoti&s;h clergy now attained greater con|&s;i&s;tence, and dignity, from the appointment of a primate. Patrick Graham, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Kennedy in the bi&s;hopric of St. Andrews, obtained from the pontiff a bull erecting that &s;ee into an archbi&s;hopric: and to this new dignity he added the titles of papal nuntio, and legate <HI>a latere.</HI> In&s;tead of con|gratulating their order upon this acce&s;&s;ion of importance, and the kingdom upon the honour and advantage of a metropolitan &s;ee, at this period to be found in all the other chief &s;tates of chri&s;tendom; and the want of which, as religion then &s;tood, might bear a derogatory interpretation, and had induced and might induce the u&s;urping claims of the primates of York; a &s;pirit of envy &s;eized the Scoti&s;h clergy. By an offer of eleven thou&s;and marks, the bi&s;hops excited James to oppo&s;e, and in|&s;ult, the archbi&s;hop: reciprocal intere&s;ts, and abu&s;es, concurred to unite the king and the prelates again&s;t Graham, a man of worth and learning, who was impri&s;oned in the ca&s;tle of Loch|leven; where he died &s;even years after, in the vain enjoyment of his titles <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ferrerius, f. v. 389.

<P><PB N="280" REF="295">The &s;tatutes of the next Scoti&s;h parliament are too minute for the notice of hi&s;tory; <NOTE PLACE="marg">1474 9 May</NOTE> but the three e&s;tates de&s;ired the king to form an alliance with the German emperor, by the means of his father-in-law, the &s;overeign of Denmark: and at the &s;ame time reque&s;ted that an emba&s;&s;y might be &s;ent into England, in order to obtain redre&s;s concerning the &s;eizure of a large &s;hip <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. 58.</NOTE>.

<P>Meanwhile a more important affair was in agitation between the courts of England and Scotland. Edward IV was aware of the arts by which Louis XI had endeavoured to fix the Scoti&s;h monarch in his intere&s;ts; and re&s;olved to fru&s;trate the de&s;ign by the di&s;play of &s;uperior advantages. In 1472 the duke of Bretagne had accu&s;ed Louis of inviting the Scots to a&s;&s;ault that duchy, upon a promi&s;e of a&s;&s;igning it to James; a charge apparently well founded, for Louis had commi&s;&s;ioned

As the offer of Bretagne was a proof of the artifice of Louis, though too gro&s;s to be attempted except with a young monarch, and unexperienced council; &s;o the demand of a Scoti&s;h fleet was a mark of his ignorance, Scotland having no &s;hips of war, and none to &s;pare from her &s;canty commerce. On the other &s;ide, James appears not to have acted without duplicity; for while he con&s;ented to the truce reque&s;ted by England and Burgundy, he imparted their de&s;igns to Louis, and in&s;inuated that he could li&s;ten to no propo&s;al inimical to the French alli|ance. At the &s;ame time he de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s through France in a pilgrimage to Rome, a de&s;ign which may have proceeded from the known &s;uper&s;tition of James; but which rather &s;eems, from the circum&s;tances, to have been founded upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that his ab&s;ence might excu&s;e the Scots from lending any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to France. Louis, in return, &s;ent Monipeny his chamberlain, to reque&s;t James not to leave his kingdom in the pre&s;ent conjuncture: and the advantages offered by England inducing the Scoti&s;h king to a deci&s;ion in favor of that kingdom, the advice of Louis was followed, though not the motive <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Duclos, II, 146: his work is compo&s;ed from the be&s;t original documents.

<P>The fre&s;h di&s;putes between England and Scotland appear to have originated in this, or the preceding year; but their cau&s;e has not been accurately explained. The death of the duke of Burgundy, which changed the views of France and England, &s;eems to have been the chief &s;ource of this altera|tion. Louis XI having been delivered from this dreadful foe, and having &s;ecured him&s;elf from the enmity of Edward IV by a truce for their lives, by the punctual remi&s;&s;ion of pen&s;ions to the Engli&s;h king and court, and by flattering Edward with the marriage of the dauphin to Elizabeth his elde&s;t daughter, there was rea&s;on to expect a la&s;ting peace between their king|doms <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Duclos, II, 275, 283, 300.</NOTE>. In con&s;equence, Edward, who&s;e temporary fears, and intere&s;t, had alone formed the treaty with Scotland, and who&s;e only de&s;ires were money and luxury, began to regret the annual di&s;bur&s;ements, and to wi&s;h for another war as a pretext of rai&s;ing money for his plea&s;ures and profu&s;ion. But their &s;acrifice of the French alliance, and their inte&s;tine com|motions, prevented the Scots from ha&s;tening into an open en|mity with England.</P>
<P>The reign of James had hitherto been &s;ucce&s;sful; and for|tune had &s;howered favours upon him, which to his wi&s;er pre|dece&s;&s;ors had been denied. The acqui&s;ition of Roxburgh,
<PB N="289" REF="304">Berwick, the Orkneys, and Shetland; the honourable mar|riage treaty with England, the re&s;umption of the earldom of Ro&s;s, were &s;plendid events, which prevented the eruption of public di&s;content at many new and arbitrary mea&s;ures. But James had provoked deep and inveterate hatred; and, having no &s;tanding army, could not rule by fear alone. A great alteration is now to take place; imprudence is to incur the u&s;ual de&s;tiny: and a thick cloud of crimes, and misfortunes, is to darken the &s;ucceeding years of this reign.</P>
<P>The character of James was &s;trongly contra&s;ted by tho&s;e of his brothers, Alexander duke of Albany, and John earl of Mar. While the king, in &s;olitary retirement, indulged his favourite &s;tudies of mu&s;ic, architecture, and a&s;trology, he forgot the duties, amid the idle amu&s;ements, of a monarch. The nobles, in the feudal ages, &s;eldom vi&s;iting the court, except upon occa&s;ions of bu&s;ine&s;s, or high fe&s;tivals, and being igno|rant of the arts in which James delighted, he had recour&s;e to the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e who excelled in them; but forgot the maje&s;ty of the &s;overeign &s;o far as to make companions and fa|vorites of men of mean origin; imitating Louis XI who had rai&s;ed his barber Oliver le Dain to great wealth, and high dignities; but a &s;tranger to the &s;tanding army, large revenue, and other re&s;ources, which enabled that king to cru&s;h the lofty, and exalt the humble. Cochran a ma&s;on or architect, and Rogers the Engli&s;h ma&s;ter of mu&s;ic, were re&s;pectable names among the favourites of the Scoti&s;h king, when followed by tho&s;e of Leonard a &s;mith, Hommil a taylor, and Torphichan a fencing ma&s;ter <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ferrer. f. 395.</NOTE>. The contempt and indignation of the no|bility were extreme, when they beheld the public favour of the &s;overeign to tho&s;e minions, joined with a pointed neglect of their haughty order.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="305">Albany was a &s;en&s;ible and &s;pirited prince, fond of martial exerci&s;es, of fine hor&s;es, and of attendants tall and vigorous. In per&s;on he was of a middle &s;tature, &s;trong, and well propor|tioned: his broad &s;houlders, and blooming yet &s;tern counte|nance, engaged the prai&s;e of a martial age: and his known courage, if we believe an hi&s;torian, was the only cau&s;e why the nobles did not rebel again&s;t James, while he lived in amity with this brother <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 114, 115.</NOTE>.

<P>The warden&s;hip of the ea&s;tern marches had been a&s;&s;igned to Albany, for life, by his father James II; to which the honours of governor of Berwick, and lord lieutenant of the borders, had been added. From his father he al&s;o derived the earldom of March, and its &s;trong ca&s;tle of Dunbar <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid. The act of forfeiture, &amp;c.</NOTE>. If we credit Lind|&s;ay, who &s;omewhat depraves his information by repre&s;ent|ing Alexander lord Home as chamberlain &s;ince the reign of James II, while he held not that office till the commencement of that of James IV, a violent enmity had taken place between Albany, and the Homes and Hepburns, who&s;e e&s;tates lay con|tiguous to his earldom of March. In order to ruin Albany, his enemies applied to Cochran, who re&s;ented that prince's contempt, while he dreaded his power: this favourite knowing the weak part of his &s;overeign's character, procured a witch to pronounce to James, that he &s;hould be &s;lain by one of his neare&s;t kindred; and his children being infants, the &s;u&s;picion fell upon his brothers, and led to their ruin.

From the account of Ferrerius, which is the mo&s;t ancient, it appears that Mar was accu&s;ed of u&s;ing magical arts again&s;t the king's life <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 116, 117. Buch.

In our choice of weak motives, we are however left certain that the tyranny of James was &s;trong: nor is there the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to infer from the ba&s;e treaty made with Edward IV by Albany in 1482, and to which he was driven by de&s;pair and re&s;entment, that he now entertained any di&s;loyal de&s;igns; far le&s;s any in|tercour&s;e with England <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Could any connections between Albany Mar and England be di&s;covered, preceding 1479, they might vindicate James; for certain it is that Albany af|terwards branded the king as a ba&s;tard, (&s;ee letters of Dacre in the reign of James V,) and openly a&s;&s;umed the royal title. It is remarkable that the peers, in 1488, never objected the death of Mar, or exile of Albany, to James.</NOTE>, which kingdom he did not vi&s;it till three years after his e&s;cape to France; and even then was in|duced by the &s;pecial invitation, and intere&s;ted views, of Ed|ward. It is however not improbable that Albany and Mar, having al&s;o encountered the king's indifference, &s;hared the re|&s;entments of the nobles, and with them con&s;pired again&s;t the royal favourites, who had &s;ufficient intere&s;t and addre&s;s to con|found their &s;afety with that of the government. Amid the dark|ne&s;s which attends the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, it belongs to can|dour, and rea&s;on, to infer a motive &s;trong enough to blunt the feelings, and corrupt the heart, for human depravity cannot at once proceed to the utmo&s;t degree: but when we &s;peak of the

<P>As the de&s;potic temper of the king was certain, his frater|nal affections dubious, Albany thought proper, after a confine|ment of &s;ome duration, to contrive means of e&s;cape. Either by concert, or chance, a French ve&s;&s;el arrived in the Forth, and anchored near Newhaven, a &s;mall and little frequented port to the we&s;t of Leith, and of &s;hort and ea&s;y acce&s;s from Edinburgh. The captain, either in the plot before, or now gained by Albany's emi&s;&s;aries, pretended that his cargo con|&s;i&s;ted of excellent wines; and &s;ent to the ca&s;tle to reque&s;t the duke to honour him by the fir&s;t choice. Two &s;mall ca&s;ks of malm&s;ey, then a favourite wine, were ordered: and the cap|tain in one of them concealed a roll of wax, inclo&s;ing a paper of intelligence and directions; while the other conveyed a long rope, the mean of deliverance. As the duke's me&s;&s;enger was
<PB N="293" REF="308">a confidential dome&s;tic of tried fidelity, he was intru&s;ted with the &s;ecret, and &s;erved his ma&s;ter's de&s;ign with zeal. After &s;upper the commander of the fortre&s;s went to the king's apart|ment to receive his orders, James lodging in the ca&s;tle at the time; and having ordered the gates to be &s;hut, and &s;et the watch, he returned by appointment to Albany's chamber, to enjoy a collation and wine. The duke and his &s;ervant were ab&s;temious, while they artfully engaged the commander, and three of the garri&s;on who guarded the pri&s;oner, in repeated draughts of intoxication. Secure in their &s;leep, or in their death, for according to &s;ome accounts the odious gue&s;ts were &s;lain, Albany and his dome&s;tic proceeded to a retired part of the wall, concealed from the view of the watch; and the rope being fixed, and let down, the &s;ervant fir&s;t explored the dan|gerous height: but from the &s;hortne&s;s of the rope, fell, and broke his thigh: the duke guarded again&s;t the &s;ame fate, by increa&s;ing the length with the torn &s;heets of his bed, and de|&s;cending &s;afely, fir&s;t carried his faithful dome&s;tic on his back to a place of &s;ecurity; and then proceeding to Newhaven made the &s;ignal appointed, and was received on board the &s;hip, which immediately &s;ailed for France. The king was &s;o much &s;ur|prized at this e&s;cape, almo&s;t from his own pre&s;ence, that he would not yield to conviction, till he had him&s;elf examined the pri&s;oner's apartment, and &s;een the &s;pot and in&s;trument of his flight.

He &s;uppo&s;es Albany to have fled to England in 1479, and to have per&s;uaded Edward to &s;end an army in 1481, to deliver James from his peers. James thus reconciled became afterwards jealous of Albany, and impri&s;oned him in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, whence he e&s;caped to France in the manner mentioned in the text in 1483.

<P>The wars between England and Scotland now begin to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">1480</NOTE> more unfrequent, and upon this account to de&s;erve greater attention: that which now commenced is the mo&s;t memorable, &s;ince the battle of Sark, a &s;pace of more than thirty years: and &s;imilar di&s;tances divide the pre&s;ent contention, the battle of Flodden, and that of Pinkie. The great inequality of the conte&s;t is matter of glory to the &s;maller &s;tate, which unhappily
<PB N="296" REF="311">either declined, or was &s;tationary, in wealth, and power; while the other was rapidly progre&s;&s;ive. Henceforth defeated in every great conte&s;t, the &s;pirit of Scotland remained unim|paired; and while her &s;oldiers knew not the name of fear, they might execrate the caprice of chance, and the want of military &s;kill, patience, and genius, in their leaders. The hi&s;torian of the hou&s;e of Douglas he&s;itates not to pronounce that, &s;ince the fall of that family, Scotland has performed few deeds of arms <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Hume's Dougl. I, 384.</NOTE>: many of that illu&s;trious progeny were indeed <HI>born</HI> generals, and the deficiency of &s;uch &s;ingular genius, which depends upon great and prompt faculties, cool intuition, and a kind of pre&s;cience, and to which the impetuo&s;ity of the na|tional character is highly adver&s;e, was repeatedly felt by this warlike kingdom.</P>
<P>If it be often dubious, even in modern times, which of two warring nations was the aggre&s;&s;or, a &s;uperior certainty is not to be expected in remote ages. Some a&s;&s;ert that Edward IV was the author of ho&s;tilities; while others affirm that Louis XI excited the Scoti&s;h king to arms. The latter opinion might be &s;upported by the treaty, which was entered into, in the end of the year 1479, between Edward IV and the dukes of Au&s;tria and Bretagne, the foes of Louis <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Duclos, II, 374.</NOTE>: but as the French monarch pretended ignorance of that tran&s;action, and continued to pay Edward's pen&s;ion, and to cultivate his amity, dreading le&s;t he &s;hould openly a&s;&s;i&s;t the Flemings, with whom the French were at war, it does not &s;eem probable that he &s;hould wi&s;h, by in|citing the Scots to arms, to provoke the decided enmity of England. A diver&s;ion of a part of Edward's force was all that could have been gained; while the practices of Louis might have been puni&s;hed by the remainder. Other arguments again&s;t
<PB N="297" REF="312">this &s;uppo&s;ition ari&s;e from the &s;ilence of Comines, that great contemporary, and other French writers, concerning this war, or any part taken by Louis in its provocation; and from the reception of Albany in France, which argues no friend&s;hip between Louis and James: the truce of fifty-four years, and the marriage treaty with England, having con&s;iderably impaired the connection between France and Scotland. On the other hand, as is before ob&s;erved, it is certain that in 1478 Edward, by di&s;continuing the payment of Cecilia's portion, had infringed the amity with Scotland, who&s;e re&s;entment had only been &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by the commotions in the royal family, and by the long di&s;u&s;e of war. But to guard again&s;t any ho&s;tile intention of the Scots, Edward, on the twelfth day of May 1480, had named his brother Richard duke of Gloce&s;ter, the future u&s;urper, lieutenant-general of the North, and appointed him to lead an army again&s;t his inveterate enemy the Scoti&s;h king; whom he accu&s;es of an intention to violate the truce, and enter the Engli&s;h territories, "in contempt of his own &s;ame <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Rymer, XII, 115, "Spreta ip&s;ius nominis, omni&s;que nobilitatis, fama." It is ri&s;ible to ob&s;erve the ignorance of Abercromby, II, 434, and Granger, (Maitland's hi&s;t. II, 682,) who &s;uppo&s;e the term <HI>nobilitas,</HI> (noblene&s;s of mind, honour,) to apply in a modern &s;en&s;e to the Scoti&s;h <HI>nobility;</HI> and &s;agely infer that Edward was no &s;tranger to the di&s;contents of the Scoti&s;h nobles!

The nobles beheld the places, formerly given by the king to their &s;ons, now &s;old to Mar's followers: the prelates, and dignitaries of the church, &s;ighed at the increa&s;e of &s;imony: even the daily pittance of the poor did not e&s;cape, for Cochran had deba&s;ed the current &s;ilver, with a degree of alloy, which rendered it <HI>black money,</HI> a fraud which led to his ruin, and that of his ma&s;ter; and which has been erroneou&s;ly confounded with the <HI>billon</HI> coinage, ordained by the parliament of 1466, which was intended for the benefit of the poor, and was continued in all the &s;ucceeding reigns.

The an&s;wer of James was far from &s;atisfactory; but the peers a&s;&s;ented to delay; and di&s;&s;embled till &s;ome deci&s;ive occa&s;ion &s;hould ari&s;e. An occa&s;ion now occurred, &s;uch as the Scoti&s;h nobles, to their &s;ingular di&s;grace, have been accu&s;tomed to &s;eize, from the reign of the fir&s;t to the termination of that of the fifth James. In&s;tead of u&s;ing the proper period of peace, the proper place of parliament, the day of war, and the camp, have afforded the ruinous &s;cene of internal di&s;&s;ention; and the &s;acred intere&s;ts and glory of their country have often been abandoned by the nobility, to gratify a ju&s;t, or unju&s;t re&s;ent|ment again&s;t their &s;overeign. But the fatal forms of a Scoti&s;h parliament, &s;o well adapted to royal influence, the conception that it was a royal court, the incapacity of rude nobles to &s;peak again&s;t an educated clergy, ever devoted to the king the &s;ource of their fleeting dignities, contribute greatly to ab&s;olve the nobles from this imputation; and it is matter of regret, rather than of &s;urpri&s;e, that they always &s;eized the only occa&s;ion when their power was collected and firm.</P>
<P>The Scoti&s;h array, amounting to about fifty thou&s;ands, had crouded to the royal banner at Burrough-muir near Edinburgh, <NOTE PLACE="marg">July</NOTE> whence they marched to Soutray, and to Lauder, at which place they encamped between the church and the village <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 122.

On the morning after their arrival at Larder, the peers a&s;&s;embled in a &s;ecret council, in the church, and deliberated upon their de&s;igns of revenge. The earls of Angus, Argyle, Huntley, Orkney or Caithne&s;s,

In the cour&s;e of the debate Gray took occa&s;ion to introduce an apologue: the mice con&s;ulted upon the means of deliverance from their tyrannic enemy the cat, and agreed that a bell &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended about her neck, to notify her approach and their danger; but what mou&s;e had courage &s;ufficient to fa&s;ten the bell? "I &s;hall bell the cat," exclaimed the impatience of Angus, in whom a current of the blood of Douglas flowed; and the homely times conferred upon him the appellation of Archi|bald Bell the Cat. It was concluded that the king &s;hould be put in a gentle impri&s;onment, in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh: and that all his favourites &s;hould be in&s;tantly hanged over the bridge of Lauder.</P>
<P>Cochran, ignorant of their de&s;igns, at length left the royal pre&s;ence to proceed to the council. This up&s;tart earl was attended by three hundred men, armed with light battle-axes, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by his livery of white with black fillets. He was clothed in a riding cloak of black velvet, and wore a large chain of gold around his neck: his horn of the cha&s;e, or of battle, was adorned with gold and precious &s;tones: and his helmet, overlaid with the &s;ame valuable metal, was born before him <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Even his pavilions were of &s;ilk, and the fa&s;tening chains were richly gilt. Lind&s;ay, 124.</NOTE>. Approaching the door of the church, he commanded an at|tendant to knock with authority; and Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven, who guarded the pa&s;&s;age, enquiring the name, was
<PB N="308" REF="323">an&s;wered, "'Tis I, the earl of Mar," Cochran, and &s;ome of his friends, were admitted: Angus advanced to him, and pulling the golden chain from his neck, &s;aid "A rope will become thee better;" while Douglas of Lochleven &s;eized his hunting horn, declaring that he had been too long a hunter of mi&s;chief. Rather a&s;toni&s;hed than alarmed, Cochran &s;aid, "My lords is it je&s;t or earne&s;t?" To which it was replied, "It is good earne&s;t, and &s;o thou abu&s;ed our prince's favour; but no longer expect &s;uch advantage, for thou and thy followers &s;hall now reap the de&s;erved reward."</P>
<P>Having &s;ecured Mar, the lords di&s;patched &s;ome men at arms to the king's pavilion, conducted by two or three moderate and prudent leaders, who amu&s;ed James while their followers &s;eized the favourites. Sir William Roger the Engli&s;h mu&s;ician, Pre&s;ton a gentleman, Hommil, Torphichan, Leonard, and others, were in&s;tantly hanged over the bridge at Lauder. John Ram&s;ay of Balmain, having cla&s;ped the king's per&s;on, was alone &s;pared. Cochran was now brought out, his hands bound with a rope; and his weak pride de&s;iring to exchange the ig|nominious bonds of a thief for the &s;ilken cords of his own pavilion, he was an&s;wered that he was a traitor and only found merited &s;hame: he was conducted to the bridge, and hanged above his companions <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 125.

<P>Such was the influence of the ari&s;tocracy over their warlike followers, that the king was conveyed to the ca&s;tle of Edin|burgh, without commotion or murmur. Here he was &s;erved with re&s;pect: but was attended by &s;ome of the peers, to ob|&s;erve his conduct, and prevent his e&s;cape, till he &s;hould give ample &s;ecurity not to revenge the death of his favourites; to

<P>Meanwhile the Engli&s;h army had acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town of Berwick: and the generals, Gloce&s;ter and Albany, learning that the Scoti&s;h army was di&s;banded, and the king impri&s;oned, left a party to conduct the &s;iege of Berwick ca&s;tle, and advanced with the main force to Endinburgh <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ferrer. 396.

If, with &s;ome writers, we believe that James was not impri&s;oned in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, but cho&s;e that fortre&s;s as a &s;ecure retreat, the difficulty remains the &s;ame, or greater <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">The impri&s;onment is however certain from two charters.

Even records cannot atone for the want of con|temporary hi&s;torians; and in &s;uch England and Scotland are at this period barren. That Edward IV and Albany were &s;incere in their agreement appears from its renewal in the following year; which al&s;o in&s;tructs us that Angus and Gray were then, if not before, engaged in the trea&s;onable ambition of Albany. Hence almo&s;t the only rational view which pre|&s;ents it&s;elf is, that Albany, finding a great majority of the nobles, and the popular voice, completely adver&s;e to his unna|tural and ba&s;e &s;chemes <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The continuator of Harding po&s;itively &s;ays that Gloce&s;ter gave peace to Scotland, becau&s;e the peers did not join Albany.</NOTE>, was forced to temporize, and accept

The acqui&s;ition of Berwick would afford a prize &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy Gloce&s;ter; who might judge, from per&s;onal knowledge, that a delay was more expe|dient than the perdition of the &s;cheme by precipitation.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h army amounted only to about &s;ixteen thou&s;and; and the materials for a &s;iege had been left before Berwick; hence the capture of the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, and of James, could hardly be attempted by &s;o few battalions, liable &s;oon to be &s;urrounded or intercepted by a &s;uperior force. A Scoti&s;h army was actually a&s;&s;embling at Haddington, under the com|mand of &s;everal patriotic peers; and even the courage of Gloce&s;ter might tremble at the pro&s;pect of a battle, without the po&s;&s;ibility of a retreat <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ferrer. 397, Le&s;ley, 322.</NOTE>.

However this be, after a brief negotiation, Shevis, the archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews, Livington the bi&s;hop of Dunkeld, lord Evandale the chancellor, and the earl of Argyle, all rather eminent in attachment to James, entered into a &s;olemn engagement with Albany, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Aug.</NOTE> that if he pre&s;erved his duty to the king, and the terms of his bond to them, and other Scoti&s;h lords, his lands and offices &s;hould be re&s;tored, and he and his followers receive an amne&s;ty: they al&s;o engaged

<P>Our ignorance of the views of parties, at this period, creates deep ob&s;curity. Abercromby, a warm defender of James III, and enemy of Albany, denies the fact, II, 452. But a partizan is little calculated to throw light, where even a candid writer may be bewildered. Neither Albany nor James were entitled to complete fame or reproach. They wavered, like the many, between vice and virtue. Albany &s;eems to have a&s;pired to the government, on the plan of his predece&s;&s;ors in the title, Robert and Murdac. This probably was the cau&s;e of his forfeiture in 1479; and when he gained this in Augu&s;t 1482, he was &s;atisfied.

<P>The final events of the reign of James III approach, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1488</NOTE> in|tere&s;ting from their novelty, and magnitude. A gradual con|federacy of many nobles had long been forming again&s;t the feeble and de&s;potic government of this monarch; but amid materials not eminent in opulence, or accuracy, amid the various intere&s;ts and political views of modern writers, it is difficult to a&s;certain the different actors in this important &s;cene. There is no evidence that the congre&s;s, appointed to be held by the commi&s;&s;ioners of England and Scotland in January, took effect; and it even &s;eems that the caprice of the Scoti&s;h king, <NOTE PLACE="marg">May</NOTE> or &s;ome other cau&s;e, had alienated Henry, who granted a &s;afe-conduct, in terms rather unu&s;ual, to the bi&s;hops of Gla&s;gow and Dunkeld, the earl of Argyle chancellor of Scot|land, the lords Hales and Lyle, the <HI>ma&s;ters,</HI> or heirs of Darnley and Home, with one hundred and &s;ixty attendants <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ibid, XII, 340, May.

On all &s;ides it is agreed that the former traitors, Angus and Gray, united to them Home, ju&s;tly enraged at a de&s;potic violation of private property; the fir&s;t and the la&s;t nobleman being the chief authors of the rebellion. The power of the Hepburns was led into it by lord Hales; and the trea&s;on of the lords Drummond, and Lyle, is equally unque&s;tionable. Darnley, or Lennox, is ob|noxious to the &s;ame charge, from the &s;trong te&s;timony of the earlie&s;t narration, and from the mention of his &s;on in the Engli&s;h pa&s;&s;port; which fixes a &s;tain on Argyle, the le&s;s ea&s;ily to be overcome, as he al&s;o appears in the mo&s;t ancient account. When it is added that to the&s;e great names afterwards acceded Huntley, Errol, the earl Mar&s;hal, and lord Glamis, the impolicy of James, which could alienate &s;o many chiefs, mu&s;t appear in a &s;triking point of view; and the rebellious war of Douglas, in the preceding reign, &s;inks into unimportance, when compared with this grand confederacy <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">For the names of the peers who oppo&s;ed James compare Ferrerius, f. 399, Le&s;ley, (who however &s;eems here to copy the former,) p. 327: Lind&s;ay, 139, names Angus, <HI>Evandale,</HI> the Hepburns, (&s;o under&s;tand) his erroneous earl of Bothwell,) Home, 140, Gray, Drummond; and from p. 142 it appears that the men were chiefly borderers, whom the ju&s;tice of James wi&s;hed to repre&s;s.

<P><PB N="330" REF="345">Of the events which preceded the deci&s;ive engagement, Buchanan has, contrary to his u&s;ual practice, given the mo&s;t ample and accurate detail, and the mo&s;t concordant with the original records. According to that hi&s;torian, James &s;hewed di&s;tingui&s;hed favour to Crawford, whom he afterwards created duke of Montro&s;e; and to Angus, who&s;e conduct at Lauder, and attachment to Albany, he affected to forget. But the king's di&s;&s;imulation and in&s;incerity being known, Angus regarded this new affection as only the &s;nare of his own de&s;truction, and even &s;u&s;pected that his powerful concurrence was courted again&s;t the peers, with a view to &s;ow divi&s;ion and ruin, afterwards to recoil upon his own head. It is a&s;&s;erted that the factious nobles being a&s;&s;embled at Edinburgh, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan.</NOTE> the king invited Angus to the ca&s;tle, and propo&s;ed to him to lend his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in making them pri&s;oners. In&s;tead of compliance, the earl di&s;clo&s;ed the de&s;ign to the peers, and joined them in their retreat <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Buchan. XII, 56, 57. The deep &s;hades of this hi&s;torian are &s;omewhat &s;oftened. He &s;ays that James propo&s;ed to Angus to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the rebellious peers; but Ferrerius, 400, allows that the king had a marked aver&s;ion to &s;hedding blood. The a&s;&s;emblage of the peers at Edinburgh could only have been on account of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, there held on the 29th Jan. in which James, as above-mentioned, created four new peers, Carm. 72, with a view to weaken the old ari&s;tocracy; but one of them, Drummond, ungratefully joined the rebels. On the rebellion of Douglas 1454 many new peers had been, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, created.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this mo&s;t imprudent confidence, after the de&s;ertion of Angus, the chief potentate on the &s;outh of the Forth, who could have assi&s;ted him again&s;t the rebellious in|clinations of the remainder, James di&s;tru&s;ting the whole of that region, re&s;olved to pa&s;s into the north, which remained devoted to his intere&s;ts. With his u&s;ual imprudence he cro&s;&s;ed the Forth in one of &s;ir Andrew Wood's ve&s;&s;els, employed in the Flemi&s;h trade. A report immediately &s;pread that the king,
<PB N="331" REF="346">overcome by his fears, had quitted the realm to retire into Flanders; and amid the general con&s;ternation the rebels took the ca&s;tle of Dunbar, and advanced to Leith. Having i&s;&s;ued order to the array of Fife, Strathern, and Angus, to attend his &s;tandard upon an appointed day, James proceeded to Aberdeen, where the northern counties eagerly poured forth their bands in defence of the royal cau&s;e <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley's account, 328, 329, is very defective. Ferrerius, f. v. 399, f. 400, confounds the affair at Blackne&s;s with that at Sauchy; and Lind&s;ay falls into the &s;ame error p. 137-144; at p. 142 of his hi&s;tory a hiatus &s;hould be marked before the paragraph, "Thus the king being in order," &amp;c. as all before relates to the fir&s;t encounter; and after to the &s;econd.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The king now returned to Perth with his &s;tandard di&s;played, and followed by Athole his uncle, by Huntley, Crawford, and many northern peers and chiefs, and by a numerous army. As he advanced David Lind&s;ay of the Byres, who had gathered warlike experience in the campaigns of France, joined him with a thou&s;and hor&s;e, and three thou&s;and infantry, if we credit the, perhaps, partial relation of Lind&s;ay the hi&s;torian; who adds, that the king accepted from his hands the ominous pre&s;ent of a grey cour&s;er, more fit as would &s;eem for flight than for attack. Among others who furni&s;hed their array, lord Ruthven was al&s;o remarkable, who led a thou&s;and gentlemen on hor&s;e|back, provided with defen&s;ive armour and &s;pears, a thou&s;and bowmen, and a thou&s;and armed with &s;words and mail.

<P>Thus prepared he advanced again&s;t the rebels, who had not been deficient in their preparations. <NOTE PLACE="marg">April?</NOTE> He found them near Blackne&s;s, on the &s;outh of the Forth; and an indeci&s;ive &s;kir|mi&s;h followed, in which Crawford, &s;ir Thomas Turnbull, who
<PB N="332" REF="347">bore the royal banner, and Innes of Innes, eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed their valour. But both parties being &s;en&s;ible of the odiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;hedding civil blood, and dreading the ab&s;olute deci&s;ion of the conte&s;t, a negotiation commenced; the king &s;ub&s;cribed &s;ome unknown articles, and delivered Athole to Hales as a pledge of their accompli&s;hment. The armies were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and tranquillity was for a very &s;hort time re&s;tored <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Even Buchanan blends with this &s;ingular tran&s;action &s;ome circum&s;tances, palpably belonging to the events of June, as the capture of the prince by the rebels, which, if it had occurred, would have rendered the deliverance of Athole as a pledge u&s;ele&s;s, a &s;uperior &s;ecurity being already in their hands.

<P>The demands of the rebels appear to have been exorbitant; and James eluding or delaying their accompli&s;hment, the con|federates gradually extended their influence, and projects, till at length they in&s;i&s;ted on the king's abdication, and the &s;ub&s;ti|tution of his &s;on in the regency, or on the throne <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Buch.

<P>The monarch learning this formidable de&s;ign di&s;patched envoys to France, and England, to &s;olicit the immediate inter|ference of the&s;e powers, by emba&s;&s;adors to mediate between him and the di&s;contented ari&s;tocracy: but this mediation, if effected, was fruitle&s;s <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Ferrer. f. v. 399.

<P>Meanwhile the con&s;piring peers found means to corrupt Shaw of Sauchy, in who&s;e charge the prince had been left at Stirling; and the infamous governor &s;urrendered the innocent youth, who was conducted to Linlithgow, and by con&s;traint was to appear guilty of a father's blood. It was artfully pro|claimed that James &s;ought the life of his &s;on, who&s;e defence had called the peers to war; and the prince's name was it&s;elf an army. A part of the king's trea&s;ure, which had formerly been &s;eized at Leith, contributed to provide waggons for baggage and &s;tores, and to attract the de&s;perate and the mer|cenary <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, 139, 140.

<P>James proceeded to Stirling, to join the peers of the north and we&s;t, who were advancing with their troops. On his arrival the treacherous governor denied him admittance. In the north, Huntley, Errol, the earl Mar&s;hal, and Glamis, had now de&s;erted the royal cau&s;e; and the junction of &s;uch di&s;tant troops as continued their attachment was attended with ne|ce&s;&s;ary delay. In the impatience of irre&s;olution James was led to commit his fortunes to a battle. Glencairn, and other peers of the we&s;t, having joined the royal army, the king advanced to meet the rebels, who had pa&s;&s;ed the Carron; and a field, about a mile &s;outh of the famous &s;cene of Bannocburn, was to

<P>As the king, in his &s;light, was about to pa&s;s the rivulet Ban|nocburn, at the hamlet of Miltown <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Nimmo, 230.</NOTE>, a woman, who was drawing water, alarmed at his appearance, and rapidity, fled, and left her pitcher, which &s;tartled the &s;teed, or di&s;ordered his career, &s;o that the unexperienced rider fell from the &s;addle, and oppre&s;&s;ed with the weight of his armour fainted away. A miller and his wife conveyed their unknown &s;overeign into a corner of the mill; and, to conceal the &s;tranger from any pur|&s;uers, they covered him with a cloth. Some time after he re|&s;umed his &s;en&s;es; but perceiving him&s;elf much hurt, and very weak, he called for a prie&s;t to hear his confe&s;&s;ion: and to his blunt ho&s;ts, who enquired his name and quality, his impatience an&s;wered, "I was your king this morning."

<P>On this important event &s;ome reflections naturally ari&s;e. Had James been victorious, the power of the Scoti&s;h ari&s;to|cracy might have been cru&s;hed for ever; and, weak and de&s;|potic as he was, it would have been better for the people to have had one tyrant than many. But this monarch, (if we &s;et the dubious murder of his brother a&s;ide,) was more weak than vicious; and even when his feeblene&s;s and impolicy are men|tioned, it is rather in a relative than in a po&s;itive view, for his conduct was chiefly blameable, becau&s;e ill-adapted to the fero|cious times and people, which required, in the character of &s;overeign, the duties of a magi&s;trate, and the valour and &s;kill of a general. Had James lived a century or two later, his faults would perhaps have e&s;caped ob&s;ervation. But the conduct of the rebellious peers, who&s;e &s;anguinary lu&s;t of power, and eager|ne&s;s to continue their lawle&s;s rapine, oppo&s;ed the &s;on in open combat again&s;t his father, that la&s;t infamy of civil war, cannot be too &s;everely reprobated. They excite horror, while the monarch attracts a reverential compa&s;&s;ion. Loyalty, in &s;ome ca&s;es only the virtue of a &s;lave, is in many the true&s;t patrioti&s;m;
<PB N="336" REF="351">and it is no wonder that men of eminent &s;en&s;e and integrity have manife&s;ted an attachment to the hou&s;e of Stuart, ap|proaching even to enthu&s;ia&s;m. For its intere&s;ts, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of that wild, ignorant, and ferocious ari&s;tocracy, which long continued to di&s;grace Scotland, were tho&s;e of the country at large. The exuberant power of the peers, ever eager to gratify their private ambition at the expence of the nation, was the &s;ole &s;pring of the noted misfortunes of the hou&s;e of Stuart. A long reign<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable that &s;ome hi&s;torians hint that James IV fell not at Flodden, but by the hands of &s;ome one of his peers; and perhaps a theori&s;t might infer that the cannon which de&s;troyed the &s;econd James was not overcharged without de|sign. But the deaths of James I, the III, the V, were cau&s;ed &s;olely by the ari&s;tocracy.</NOTE>, a &s;table government, would have circum&s;cribed their ruinous &s;way, would have prevented their plans of public plunder; and they &s;ighed for a minority, a regency, the peculiar &s;ea&s;on of their arrogance, of their &s;poil. The regency of Robert duke of Albany had taught them the &s;weets of &s;haring the royal power, domains, and revenue; and had contributed to the &s;eparation of their intere&s;ts from tho&s;e of the monarch, who&s;e influence re&s;ted on their &s;upport, and who&s;e limited wealth and authority could little with&s;tand their continued encroachments. Yet by uncandid or &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers, the de&s;ire of our kings to re&s;ume their ju&s;t magi|&s;tracy, and to enforce equal laws, has been interpreted as a de&s;ign to overturn the ari&s;tocracy, while the royal mea&s;ures were &s;olely tho&s;e of defence. But as the peers really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the chief power, it is no wonder that hi&s;torians living at the period, flattered, as u&s;ual, the leading authority; and have dif|fu&s;ed over their pages calumnies again&s;t their &s;overeigns, ea&s;y to form and difficult to eradicate.

<P>THE origin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1437&mdash;1488</NOTE> and progre&s;s, of civilization &s;eem more to depend on fortuitous circum&s;tances, than upon any ex|ertion of human power, or wi&s;dom. In India, and Egypt, countries di&s;tingui&s;hed by the fir&s;t dawn of &s;cience, the natu|ral fertility of the &s;oil redeemed much time from labour; and gave lei&s;ure to the mind to build &s;peculations of knowledge and improvement, of art and luxury. Yet that much depends upon the ability of the governors, may be judged from the ex|ample of the lawgivers of antiquity, and of Peter the great, and others in modern times.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="354">No theme can be more important than the means of diffu|&s;ing civilization in a barbarous country, yet the riche&s;t libra|ries will be found to pre&s;ent no di&s;qui&s;ition on this grand topic. Sir Walter Raleigh has ob&s;erved that "the wi&s;dom of one age is the fooli&s;hne&s;s of another;" and the remark is peculiarly verified in the labyrinths of fruitle&s;s &s;cience, while the paths of u&s;eful knowledge are &s;eldom explored. Many eminent writers have recently reviewed the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, from the fore&s;t to the city, from the feeble canoe to the wooden fortre&s;s which conveys a thou&s;and mariners, and thunders its mandates in the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;eas: but the &s;acred plans of im|proving whole nations, of educating the barbaric mind to in|du&s;try and peace, of &s;peedily advancing a community from rudene&s;s to refinement, have not yet attracted the attention which their high importance demands. The very theory would afford u&s;eful views, and expand political and moral knowledge: but leaving this va&s;t theme to the &s;edulous labour of philo&s;ophy, the pre&s;ent object only warrants a few brief re|flections.</P>
<P>Amid the various que&s;tions concerning government, it has rarely been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed to what particular &s;tages of &s;ociety the different forms are be&s;t adapted. One of the chief intentions of government, and &s;ociety, is to advance the national wi&s;dom and pro&s;perity; and it &s;eems a &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition that a democracy of &s;avages, or barbarians, would be a mere anar|chy; and that equality of ignorance, and equality of mi&s;ery, would be among the mo&s;t &s;acred rights of its con&s;titution. As the advantages of laws would be unknown, it would be vain to expect a lawgiver to ari&s;e; and the more &s;agacious could only con&s;olidate the ma&s;s by the cement of &s;ome degrading &s;uper&s;tition, in it&s;elf the very &s;tronge&s;t ob&s;tacle to knowledge and improvement. But the habits of man forbid &s;uch a &s;tate
<PB N="340" REF="355">to exi&s;t, except in theory; and an ari&s;tocracy of chiefs and of prie&s;ts, of &s;trength and of wi&s;dom, is the earlie&s;t &s;tage of &s;o|ciety yet di&s;covered in any country. Even here the &s;mallne&s;s of the communities, their jarring intere&s;ts, their continual conflicts, pre&s;ent an in&s;uperable barrier to improvement; and &s;uch is the path of providence in drawing good from evil, that the fir&s;t tyrant who overcomes all the others, and u&s;urps the &s;tyle of monarch, may be hailed as the father of his country. Super&s;tition, the execration of civilized nations, is in this &s;tage mo&s;t u&s;eful, as uniting the people in one great body politic, and as a&s;&s;i&s;ting the imperfection of the laws. The blended tribes a&s;pire to be a nation, the government a&s;&s;umes a &s;table form; the monarch mu&s;t employ the mo&s;t able men in the country, or invite foreign talents, to render his autho|rity la&s;ting and re&s;pectable; and the court thus becomes a focus of civilization, which mu&s;t enlarge the more rapidly in proportion to the a&s;cendancy of the regal power. Uncivilized nations may be regarded as in a &s;tate of infancy, incapable of judging what is for their benefit; and exertions, even of de&s;|poti&s;m, to render a nation more happy, may, it is believed, be pardoned by the warme&s;t advocate for univer&s;al democracy.</P>
<P>Such have been the uniform &s;teps of civilization, in all ancient and modern nations. The democracies of Greece had pa&s;&s;ed through the ordeal of monarchy: and if the republican form of government be ever found convenient and durable, in a large country, even after the invention of repre&s;entation, it mu&s;t be when the national character has been enlightened, and improved in a &s;uperlative degree.</P>
<P>No error can be more fatal to the balance of hi&s;torical truth, than the e&s;timation of ancient times by modern ideas. An in&s;titution, eminently u&s;eful at one period, may at another become mo&s;t pernicious; and the bane of one epoch may be|come
<PB N="341" REF="356">come the felicity of another. While in a barbaric country the regal power forms the chief engine of civilization and pro&s;pe|rity, and an ignorant ari&s;tocracy the grand ob&s;tacle to the&s;e important ends, in a more advanced period an enlightened ari&s;tocracy may diffu&s;e multiplied rays through the national ma&s;s, and kindle the flame of indu&s;try and improvement in the mo&s;t remote corners of a wide empire: may by their pre&s;ence and example vanqui&s;h prejudices, irradicable by the laws or regal power, or by any democratic &s;cheme, in which the people may a&s;&s;ert their right to ignorance and fanatici&s;m. In &s;hort, whatever form of government mo&s;t promotes dome&s;tic comfort, and univer&s;al pro&s;perity, during any particular pe|riod of the national progre&s;s, may be regarded as the mo&s;t eligible, without attention to any univer&s;al theory, or predi|lection for particular con&s;titutions. A barbarous common|wealth (if &s;uch ever exi&s;ted without an ari&s;tocracy) could only become enlightened by the conque&s;t of civilized &s;tates: Sparta, and Poland, loudly proclaim the di&s;advantages of an ignorant ari&s;tocracy, de&s;tructive of all art, &s;cience, and national ad|vancement: that de&s;poti&s;m is the wor&s;t of all forms for a civi|lized people, the de&s;olated regions of the ea&s;t murmur with a melancholy echo.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Scotland continues to pre&s;ent a con&s;iderable degree of barbari&s;m during the reigns of James II and III. The laudable efforts of the fir&s;t James, to introduce public order, were followed by fatal minorities, and confu&s;ions; and the ari&s;tocratic &s;torms again ruined the welfare of the commu|nity. In impre&s;&s;ive language Bowar, who flouri&s;hed in the minority of James II, bewails the mi&s;ery of his country. "Long appears to us, O king, the time of thy arrival at majority, when thou maye&s;t be able to deliver us, confounded as we are with daily tyranny, oppre&s;&s;ed with rapine and &s;poil;
<PB N="342" REF="357">when thou maye&s;t dictate laws, and exerci&s;e ju&s;tice, that the poor, who among us have no helper but God and thee, may be freed from the hand of the powerful. Maye&s;t thou remem|ber that thou art a legi&s;tator in order that thou maye&s;t cru&s;h the robber, and re&s;train tho&s;e who deal in rapine." "The groans of the humble, and the mi&s;eries of the poor, whom I my&s;elf, who write this, have &s;een this very day, in my own neighbourhood, &s;tripped of their garments, and inhumanely de&s;poiled of their dome&s;tic uten&s;ils, con&s;train me to exclaim with him who &s;ays, 'I have &s;een the injuries which are done, the tears of the innocent, and no comforter; and that the de&s;titute cannot re&s;i&s;t violence. I have prai&s;ed the dead more than the living: and happier than both have I e&s;teemed the unborn, the &s;ole &s;trangers to the evils of this world.' And in another pa&s;&s;age, comparing the reign of James I with his own times, "Woe to us mi&s;erable wretches, expo&s;ed to rapine and injury, how can we endure to live, who enjoyed &s;uch pro&s;pe|rity in the days of that mo&s;t illu&s;trious king, and now by a &s;ad change of fortune experience the complete rever&s;e<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Cont. Fordun. 473, 474, 512.</NOTE>!"</P>
<P>It is remarkable that this contemporary author clearly indi|cates the monarch as the legi&s;lator, a circum&s;tance which con|firms the idea formerly advanced that the king and his council prepared the laws, which afterwards received the &s;anction of parliament. Nor did James II fail in the hopes which Bowar entertained; for numerous are his laws calculated for the ad|vantage of the poor. The preceding pages pre&s;ent the more memorable ordinances, but a brief recapitulation may not be improper. The &s;trict ob&s;ervation of univer&s;al internal peace, with the privilege of demanding a &s;urety from the turbulent; the equal admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e
<PB N="343" REF="358">who a&s;&s;i&s;t infringers of the law: the &s;ecurity of lea&s;es, for the &s;afety "of the poor people who labour the ground," whatever change lords might happen: the privilege to farmers of church lands, not to be expelled on a vacancy of the benefice: the &s;evere decrees again&s;t de&s;poliation<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Parl. 1450, 1469, &amp;c. the privilege to farmers of church lands occurs in a charter of 1450. Harl. 4631, Vol. I.</NOTE>. A &s;ingular act merits tran&s;cription; "It is &s;tatute and ordained, for the away-putting of &s;ornars, over-lyars, and ma&s;terful beggars, with hor&s;e, hounds, or other goods, that all officers, &s;heriffs, barons, al|dermen, baillies, as well within the burgh as without, take an inqui&s;ition at every court which they hold concerning the&s;e matters: and if any &s;uch per&s;ons be found, that their hor&s;es, hounds, or other goods, be e&s;cheated to the king; and their per&s;ons &s;ecured till his will be known. And al&s;o that the &s;heriffs, baillies, and officers, inquire at every court, if there be any pretended fools, bards, or other &s;uch like vagabonds; and if any be found, that they be put in cu&s;tody, or in irons, for their tre&s;pa&s;s, as long as they have wherewith to live, and when they have not, their ear to be nailed to the trone, or a tree, then cut off, and they bani&s;hed the country; to which if they return, they &s;hall be hanged<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Parl. 1450, c. 21.</NOTE>." This forcible lodging of &s;ome of the pretended great, and idle, upon the poor, was a notable grievance; and they are de&s;ervedly placed with con|tempt in the &s;ame &s;tatute which condemns pretended fools, and highland bards. By another &s;tatute the&s;e <HI>&s;ornars</HI> are puni&s;hed with death.

<P><PB N="344" REF="359">This prince al&s;o regulated the cu&s;toms exacted at fairs, but apparently not with a &s;ufficient liberality to trade. James III ju&s;tly extended the prohibition, and forbad any exaction from the poor who carried their little articles to the fairs<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">1469, c. 34.</NOTE>. <HI>Jean Bonhomme</HI> has, in all ages, left a great part of his fleece, either on the brambles of ari&s;tocratic oppre&s;&s;ion, or &s;horn by the poli&s;hed &s;cizzars of taxation, often only a circuitous mode of oligarchic avarice and extortion. The regulation of the ho&s;pitals for the &s;ickly poor, and other &s;tatutes of humane im|port, confer honour on the intentions of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>James III ordered copper coin to be i&s;&s;ued, for the conveni|ence of the indigent; that on account of the holidays "and divine &s;ervice," no di&s;tre&s;s for rent &s;hould take place, till three days after Whit&s;unday and Martinmas: that the proprietors of ferry-boats be re&s;tricted to certain freights: that per&s;ons ad|vancing to the army refrain from injuring gra&s;s, or corn<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">1469, c. 35. 1474, c. 62. 1481, c. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the laws concerning the burroughs, pa&s;&s;ed in the&s;e two reigns, &s;ome account has already been given in the hi&s;torical narrative. The municipal authority became an oligarchy in the reign of James III, on pretence "that great contention had ari&s;en, through the multitude and clamour of common &s;imple per&s;ons<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">1469, c. 30.</NOTE>:" and this form was unhappily to continue, becau&s;e a few are more ea&s;ily influenced by government, than a great number. But it is &s;urely the genuine intere&s;t of a government to &s;tand upon as wide a ba&s;is as po&s;&s;ible: and for the fake of a few to render a number di&s;contented, cannot be an act of political prudence.</P>
<P>Edinburgh is, at this period, by an Engli&s;h contemporary hi&s;torian &s;tyled a very rich town<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Cont. Ann. Croyland ap. Gale, Vol. I, p. 563, "diti&s;&s;imum oppidum." The author blames Glouce&s;ter for not &s;acking it in 1482; while he took Ber|wick, which co&s;t England annually 10,000 marks, "perditio non acqui&s;itio." The remark of this old writer on <HI>benevslences</HI> is curious: "ubi per benevolentiam quilibet daret id quod vellet, imo verius quod nollet," p. 558.
<P>On the 16th April 1452, the king, for the friend&s;hip he bore to the earl of Orkney, exempted Edinburgh from the cu&s;toms on &s;alt. Scot&s;t. Cal.</P></NOTE>. The city and barony of

Cal. and &s;ee reign of James V.</NOTE>." But the pro&s;perity of the latter city was to commence during the u&s;urpation of Corm|well.</P>
<P>A poem written in the latter part of the reign of James III, or beginning of that of James IV, pre&s;ents curious intelligence concerning the manners of the citizens<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Tales of the Prie&s;ts of Peebles, in Scarce Scoti&s;h Poems reprinted, London 1792, Vol. I. P. 9.</NOTE>. A que&s;tion is pro|po&s;ed, Why the wealth of burge&s;&s;es commonly expires with their immediate heirs? The rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned are, that their fathers begin in rigid poverty, "with good luck, and a half|penny, and a lamb's &s;kin;" then proceed to the &s;ituation of a pedler, who, when his pack becomes worth forty Scoti&s;h pounds, buys a large hor&s;e, then a cart. The next &s;tage is a &s;hop in town; with a counter, che&s;ts, and Flemi&s;h coffers. He becomes a merchant, and goes to &s;ea with exports and imports; marries a rich wi&s;e; his cupboard of plate is worth three thou&s;and pounds; his gowns and other garments are gay, &s;ilk on &s;undays, green or grey cloth at other times; while his wife is arrayed in &s;carlet. He dies; and his heir &s;ucceeds to opulence unacquired by labour. The &s;on is nurtured in lux|ury, wears rich rings, and is di&s;gu&s;ted to hear that his father &s;old &s;heep-&s;kins: keeps many &s;ervants, &s;pends his time in the tavern, or playing at <HI>hazard;</HI> till &s;inking into penury, he be|come the follower of &s;ome lord's &s;on at court.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="361">In the &s;ame poem the maladmini&s;tration of ju&s;tice is repeat|edly mentioned, as a chief cau&s;e of the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor. The coroners, the ju&s;tices, the &s;erjands or mairs, derived their impious emoluments by extortion, on various pretexts, from the more thriving yeomen, till they reduced them to poverty, or forced them to leave their juri&s;dictions, when their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;uffered the &s;ame fate. Bribes alone could &s;ecure an audience; an hone&s;t farmer would be accu&s;ed of theft, or rapine; and the fine impo&s;ed was mea&s;ured by the pro&s;perity of his in|du&s;try<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 12, 24, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The very laws intended for the protection of the poor were converted into in&s;truments of their oppre&s;&s;ion; while the repeated &s;tatutes for the due admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice were eluded during the regal &s;way, and fell a&s;leep during a minority. Even &s;o late as Mary's reign, the balance of ju&s;tice was com|monly u&s;ed in weighing which bribe was heavie&s;t. It was re|&s;erved for England to &s;et the fir&s;t example to the world, of complete and impartial ju&s;tice, one of the chief ble&s;&s;ings of civilized &s;ociety: and though the expence of the law be great, that of a potent bribe might far exceed it, while equality of wealth could alone &s;ecure an equitable deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Burgundian hi&s;torian, in de&s;cribing the marriage of Mary of Gelder, mentions the manners and dre&s;s of the com|mon people as very rude. "There are even," &s;ays he, "many among them who &s;eem to be altogether &s;avages<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">De Coucy, at the end of the hi&s;tory by Jean Chartier, Paris 1661, folio, p. 575.</NOTE>." The con|tra&s;t between a poli&s;hed Burgundian, of the mo&s;t &s;plendid court in Europe at the time, and a Scoti&s;h highlander, mu&s;t indeed have been &s;triking.</P>
<P>Of this barbari&s;m the want of education was a chief &s;ource; a defect which Scotland has &s;ince &s;upplied, in a mo&s;t laudable
<PB N="347" REF="362">manner, by innumerable &s;chools, where the mind may be cultivated at an expence acce&s;&s;ible by the mo&s;t indigent. It is only to be regretted that &s;o little attention is paid to the &s;alaries of the humble teachers; who, while their income ought not to rai&s;e them above their office of educating the poor, ought however to be enabled to pre&s;erve the ea&s;e, and re&s;pect, due to &s;o u&s;eful an order of men.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the common people continued a long time in the &s;tate de&s;cribed in the former retro&s;pect. The &s;umptuary law of James II ordained that no burghers, except bearing a municipal office, &s;hall wear gowns of &s;ilk, or &s;carlet cloth, or decked with <HI>mertrick</HI> furs. The regulation is extended to their wives, and daughters; who are moreover to u&s;e no gowns with long trains, except on holidays; and to wear "&s;hort kerchiefs with little hoods, as are u&s;ed in Flanders, England, and other countries." Inferior barons, and gentle|men are alike re&s;tricted. None of the clergy are to wear gowns of &s;carlet, or <HI>mertrick</HI> furs, except they be dignitaries of a cathedral, or collegiate church, or doctors; or &s;uch as may yearly &s;pend two hundred marks, or Engli&s;h nobles. And with regard to the commons, "that no labourers, nor hu&s;bandmen, wear on the work day other than grey or white; and on the holiday only light blue, green, or red: and their wives the &s;ame, and kerchiefs of their own making: and that it exceed not the price of forty pence the eln.

After di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the revenue, and expences, of England, among the latter of which he mentions the borders towards Scotland, and the garri&s;on of Calais as exorbitant articles, he ob&s;erves that the nobles of France were &s;o powerful, that no authority dared to tax them; and that great danger would ari&s;e if Eng|land permitted &s;ubjects to attain &s;uch preeminence. He adds
<PB N="349" REF="364">that the king of Scots who la&s;t died, had only from apprehen|&s;ions of his rebelling expelled Douglas, "who&s;e livelihood, and might, were nearly equivalent to his own."

<P>It has already been remarked that in the treaty with France 1484, it was agreed that on a failure of immediate heirs, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to either crown &s;hould be determined by the prelates and nobles. By an act of 1466, it was decreed that the dowry of the future queen &s;hould be "a third of the king's <HI>rents of a&s;&s;ize,</HI> that is to &s;ay of lands and cu&s;toms ONLY<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Cap. 2.</NOTE>."

<P>The able reign of Robert the great was unhappily followed by the di&s;turbed minority of his &s;on David II. Yet the reign of this feeble prince pre&s;ents &s;ome documents concerning the &s;tate of parliament, which &s;hall here be mentioned, as un|known to former writers, and as preparatory to the con&s;idera|tion of the national council, under his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the Stuart family.</P>
<P>In the parliament held at Perth, on the thirteenth of January 1365, the names of the members are given, forming, it is believed, the earlie&s;t example of what is called <HI>the roll.</HI> The bi&s;hops are followed by the abbots of Dunfermlin, Arbroth, Pai&s;ley, Scone, Kilwinning, Coupar. Among the peers is John Stuart lord of Kyle. After many knights, are twelve per|&s;ons without de&s;ignation, and a general clau&s;e of "the other per&s;ons u&s;ually called;" nor are the commi&s;&s;ioners of the burghs &s;pecified<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">4to.

<P>The general council at Scone, 20th of July 1366, con&s;i&s;ted of the bi&s;hops, abbots, priors, free-tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> "and

In that held at the &s;ame place, on the 27th of Sep|tember 1367, the <HI>three communities</HI> of the kingdom being called, "certain per&s;ons were cho&s;en by them to hold a par|liament, leave being given to the others, on account of the harve&s;t &s;ea&s;on, to return to their homes." From the clergy were &s;elected &s;ixteen; from the lords fourteen, at the head of whom is the Steward; and there were ab&s;ent, from contu|macy, the earls of March, Ro&s;s, and Douglas. The burghs are only Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Perth, Montro&s;e, Hadding|ton, and Linlithgow; their &s;elected delegates thirteen. The object of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion was the royal revenue: and the king is empowered to &s;end emba&s;&s;adors, and levy the expence by a tax, without recour&s;e to another parliament.<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ibid. fol. v. 50.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In that of Perth, 6th of March 1368, a few were contu|maciou&s;ly ab&s;ent; but by the con&s;ent of the <HI>three communities,</HI> on account of the inconvenience and &s;carcity of the &s;ea&s;on, "certain per&s;ons were elected to hold the parliament, leave being given to the others to return." Seven bi&s;hops, and nine others, are cho&s;en for the clergy; among the latter are Wil|liam Biggar rector of Errol and chamberlain of Scotland, and the <HI>procurators</HI> of the bi&s;hops of Aberdeen and Ro&s;s; but as it was found that fewer were &s;ufficient, the number was abridged. For the barons are the Steward, the earls of Mar and March, and the <HI>procurator</HI> of earl Douglas, with thirteen landed gen|tlemen; and eight others, perhaps for the burghs<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid. fol. 52. The excu&s;e is in the&s;e words, "propter importunitatem et cari&s;tiam temporis."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At the parliament of Scone, 12th June 1368, appeared "the prelates, lords, and burge&s;&s;es, who would or could be
<PB N="352" REF="367">per&s;onally pre&s;ent; others repre&s;ented by their <HI>commi&s;&s;aries;</HI> others being ab&s;ent from contumacy."

"Aliis per <HI>commi&s;&s;arios</HI> comparentibus." The term is here applied to procurators in general.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t general council recorded of David II, and held at Perth on the 18th of February 1370, the burge&s;&s;es pre&s;ent are mentioned to have been &s;pecially &s;ummoned for certain cau&s;es.

<P>The model of this noted parliament being imitated by the kings of the Stuart line, as mentioned in their &s;tatutes, it is proper to lend it due illu&s;tration. The preamble bears that, as the chief purport of this general council was to con&s;ider the &s;tate of the realm, the royal revenue, and &s;ome points relating to the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, it was <HI>not expedient</HI> that all the members &s;hould attend: for which rea&s;on &s;ome were elected, "BY THE GENERAL AND UNANIMOUS CONSENT AND ASSENT OF THE THREE COMMUNITIES ASSEMBLED, to order tho&s;e things that concern common ju&s;tice, &s;uch as the contradicted judgments (or appeals,) que&s;tions, and other complaints, which ought to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and determined by parliament. And others were elected, by the SAME CONSENT AND ASSENT OF THE COMMUNITIES, to treat and deliberate on certain SPECIAL, and SECRET, affairs of the king and kingdom, before they came to the knowledge of the &s;aid general council<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P>Lord Pitmedden, about the beginning of this century, had made &s;ome inac|curate extracts from this invaluable regi&s;ter, and the above is among them. See lord Hailes's Annals, II, 262.</P></NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="368">For the matters concerning the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice were cho&s;en &s;ix of the clergy; ten knights, and four others, for the barons; and &s;even burge&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>For the &s;ecret affairs three clergy; and ten others, among whom the Steward, and the earls of Carrick and March are fir&s;t named, and the la&s;t is Duncan Wallace, "one of the <HI>attorneys</HI> of the earl of Douglas." It is &s;pecially added that the king may name any others.</P>
<P>This, as far as appears, was the very fir&s;t in&s;titution of the famous LORDS OF THE ARTICLES, originally only a committee for &s;ecret affairs, &s;elected by the voice of the whole legi&s;lative body. But the power a&s;&s;igned to the king, of adding any members he thought proper, led to great abu&s;es.</P>
<P>After the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Stuart the earlie&s;t memo|rable parliament is that of Scone, 2d March 1372, in the fir&s;t year of Robert II. The burge&s;&s;es pre&s;ent continued to be &s;pe|cially &s;ummoned, <HI>ex cau&s;a,</HI> for a certain cau&s;e. And as the general council is held for purpo&s;es relating to the king and realm, and the admini&s;tration of common ju&s;tice, "in imita|tion of the order and method which were ob&s;erved in the par|liament held at Perth, in the time of king David of venerable memory, and of his reign the fortieth year," [18 Feb. 1370,] &s;ome were cho&s;en BY THE GENERAL AND UNANIMOUS CON|SENT AND ASSENT OF THE THREE COMMUNITIES, for matters concerning common ju&s;tice. And others, "BY THE CONSENT
<PB N="354" REF="369">AND ASSENT OF THE SAID COMMUNITIES, to treat and de|liberate on certain SPECIAL affairs of the king and kingdom, before they come to the knowledge of the general council." The other members were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. For the names of tho&s;e cho&s;en we are referred to another regi&s;ter. It is remarkable that in this parliament the plea of &s;ecrecy is omitted; and the lords of the articles are only cho&s;en for SPECIAL affairs.<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. v. 58. "Imitando videlicet ordinem illum et modum, qui &s;erva|batur in parlamento tento apud Perth, tempore venerandae memoriae domim Regis David, anno regni ip&s;ius quadrage&s;imo." .... "Et alii, PER CONSEN|SUM ET ASSENSUM EARUNDEM COMMUNITATUM, electi ad tractandum et deliberandum &s;uper certis SPECIALIBUS Regis et Regni negotiis, antequam perveniant ad notitiam concilii generalis."
<P>The &s;tatutes of David II are inaccurately copied in a bad hand; but the writing of tho&s;e of Robert II is greatly improved; whence this pa&s;&s;age &s;erves to illu&s;trate the genuine reading of the former.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The parliament of Robert III, in February 1401, only bears that there were pre&s;ent the bi&s;hops, [abbots,] priors, dukes, earls, barons, "freeholders, and burge&s;&s;es who hold of our lord the king <HI>in capite</HI><NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Apud Skene Reg. Maj.</NOTE>." But that the in&s;titution of the lords of the articles continued an inveterate u&s;age, appears from the parliament of Perth, 26th May 1424, the fir&s;t of James I<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Acts edit. 1566, fol. 1. "electae fuerunt certae perfonae ad articulos datos per dominum Regem determinandos, data caeteris licentia recedendi." Be|fore they were only to treat and deliberate; now to <HI>determine.</HI></NOTE>; and the fir&s;t, it is believed, in which the &s;tyle of the ARTICLES appears; and from numerous &s;ucceeding par|liaments. It is al&s;o certain that the u&s;age of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the other members, after the committees of ju&s;tice and of the ar|ticles had been &s;elected, was continued to the parliament of 1424, if not long after: &s;o that the prolongation of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, after the appointment of the&s;e committees, was a mere &s;tretch
<PB N="355" REF="370">of the prerogative, as well as the latter corrupt mode of chu&s;ing the lords of the articles. At what preci&s;e epoch the committee of ju&s;tice was divided into two, 1 <HI>ad judicia,</HI> or of judgments in criminal ca&s;es, and 2. <HI>ad cau&s;as,</HI> or of civil cau&s;es and law|&s;uits in the la&s;t appeal, does not appear: but &s;uch was the method in the reign of James III<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Records of Parliament, Regi&s;ter Office, <HI>pa&s;&s;im.</HI></NOTE>. Yet even at this period the lords of the articles were mode&s;tly named la&s;t, after the two former committees had been appointed; not fir&s;t, as was afterwards the u&s;age, when the lords of the articles were named by the influence of the court, who&s;e demands u&s;urped a preference over the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The &s;teps that led to this radical alteration of the con&s;titu|tion of the Scoti&s;h parliament, which was at fir&s;t to preclude the power of debate, by only requiring the &s;anction of a full parliament to decrees already adju&s;ted; and was afterwards to make that a&s;&s;embly a mere in&s;trument of the crown; de&s;erve particular inve&s;tigation. The chief cau&s;e was the indolence and avarice of the members, who regarded their attendance in parliament, to which they were not only bound by their te|nures, but under a &s;ine of ten pounds for ab&s;ence, as a mo&s;t heavy con&s;traint and intolerable burden. Even in England at this period committees were frequently appointed and leave given to the other members to depart<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">See Rolls of Parliament. Edward III, in 1340, ordered that in every parliament a prelate, two earls, and two barons, &s;hould &s;it to judge appeals, 14 E. 3 cap. 5. Barrington on the Statutes, p. 244. And &s;ee Wight, 98.</NOTE>. The &s;ole di&s;tinction was, that in Scotland the cu&s;tom by a political &s;oleci&s;m re|mained, while the parliament it&s;elf continued in full &s;e&s;&s;ion. This apparently &s;light difference, and the equally &s;light cir|cum&s;tance, that in England the members were too numerous to meet in one room, decided the de&s;tinies of the two king|doms.
<PB N="356" REF="371">England had a free parliament for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and a hou&s;e of commons: Scotland an influenced parliament for a&s;&s;ent, and her commons were overpowered by the pre&s;ence of the &s;uperior orders.</P>
<P>From the advantage which was afterwards taken of this in&s;titution of lords of the articles, it would &s;eem a device of &s;ome cunning Augu&s;tus, to &s;ap the freedom of his country. It was, on the contrary, the mere product of chance and weakne&s;s. The appointment of committees, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the other members, in September 1367 and March 1368, the fir&s;t on account of the harve&s;t, the &s;econd an unexpectedly &s;evere &s;ea&s;on and &s;carcity, evince the progre&s;s of chance: and the character of David II, and his hatred, at the time, to the Stuarts, who were to be the heirs of his power, &s;hew the want of de&s;ign. The unanimous con&s;ent and a&s;&s;ent, of the whole three e&s;tates a&s;&s;embled, te&s;tifies that they exulted in their de|liverance from the &s;lavery of attending in parliament, and re|garded the eighteenth day of February, thirteen hundred and &s;eventy, as a jubilee of freedom!</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent &s;tatutes, which illu&s;trate the con&s;titution of parliament, are far from numerous. The mo&s;t memorable is the next in chronological order, that of James I, in March 1428<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Acts, f. v. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"The king, with con&s;ent of the whole general council, has ordained that the &s;mall barons, and free-tenants, need not come to the parliament, or general council, provided that each &s;heriffdom &s;end two, or more, wi&s;e men, cho&s;en at the head court of the &s;heriffdom, according to its extent, except the &s;heriffdoms of Clackmanan and Kinro&s;s, which may only &s;end one member for each.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="372">"The&s;e members &s;hall be called Commi&s;&s;aries of the &s;hire: and, by the&s;e Commi&s;&s;aries of all the &s;hires &s;hall be cho&s;en a wi&s;e man; and expert, called the Common Speaker of the parlia|ment, who &s;hall propo&s;e all and &s;undry nece&s;&s;ities and cau&s;es, pertaining to the Commons, in the parliament or general council<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Common Speaker</HI> is a mere abbreviated phra&s;e for the <HI>Commons' Speaker,</HI> or Speaker of the Commons. It could never be intended that a commi&s;&s;ioner of the &s;hire &s;hould &s;upplant the chancellor, and become <HI>general</HI> &s;peaker of the par|liament.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"The Commi&s;&s;aries &s;hall have full and entire power from the re&s;t of the &s;heriffdom, te&s;tified by the &s;eal of the &s;heriff, and tho&s;e of &s;everal barons of the &s;hire, to hear, treat, and finally to determine, all cau&s;es to be propo&s;ed in the council or parliament.</P>
<P>"Which Commi&s;&s;aries, and Speaker, &s;hall have their expence defrayed by tho&s;e of each &s;hire who owe appearance in the par|liament or council, an equal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment being laid on every pound of rent, except tho&s;e of bi&s;hops, abbots, priors, dukes, earls, lords of parliament, and <HI>banrents,</HI> whom the king di|rects to be &s;ummoned and admitted to parliament by his &s;pe|cial precept."</P>
<P>Such is this remarkable &s;tatute, the intentions of which are &s;uppo&s;ed never to have been fulfilled till 1587; when it was revived and enforced, and the fir&s;t regular repre&s;entation for counties commenced in Scotland. It is evident that this great monarch wi&s;hed to e&s;tabli&s;h a Hou&s;e of Commons, on the Eng|li&s;h model, and to lay the foundations of genuine liberty, by dividing the landed gentlemen from the peers, and thus &s;trengthening the third e&s;tate, which only con&s;i&s;ted of a few burge&s;&s;es, unable to contend again&s;t the whole landed intere&s;t united, a French <HI>noble&s;&s;e,</HI> in&s;tead of a di&s;tinct order of noble|men
<PB N="358" REF="373">like tho&s;e of England. But when this act was revived in 1587<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Cap. 113.</NOTE>, the clau&s;e concerning the Common Speaker, or Speaker of the Commons, was carefully omitted: and thus the chief intention was eluded, and the commi&s;&s;aries of the &s;hires, and burghs, continued to &s;it in the &s;ame hou&s;e with the peers.</P>
<P>It has already been ob&s;erved in the hi&s;torical narrative that, in 1458, it was enacted that no freeholder &s;hall be con&s;trained to attend as a member of parliament, if he hold of the king "under the &s;um of twenty pounds" in land. In 1504 the exemption is, under "one hundred marks of the extent that now is;" and an extent implies annual value. Twenty pounds in 1458, Scoti&s;h money being to the Engli&s;h as one to three, and its power being to the pre&s;ent as ten to one, may nearly equal &s;eventy pounds &s;terling of modern currency. In 1504 the coin was as one to four, and one hundred marks might equal one hundred and &s;ixty of our pounds. The Eng|li&s;h parliament had enacted, in 1429, that none &s;hould <HI>vote</HI> for knight of the &s;hire, who had not freeholds of the value of forty &s;hillings: but in Scotland it was e&s;teemed a great privi|lege to be exempted from &s;itting in parliament; and voting could not be enforced even by the united efforts of the monarch and legi&s;lative body.</P>
<P>From 1504 till 1587 there are no &s;tatutes concerning the con&s;titution of parliament.</P>
<P>To return to the con&s;ideration of the period under review, we have &s;een that in 1469, an oligarchic plan of appointing the council, and magi&s;trates of burghs, was in&s;tituted, and the parliament was compared with common courts of ju&s;tice: and in 1482 the mention of the parliament of Paris indicates that the French idea of a parliament was, by the court, pre|ferred
<PB N="359" REF="374">to the Engli&s;h. The numerous clergy pre&s;ent at a Sco|ti&s;h parliament, and the want of an oppo&s;ition, are features delineated and explained in the preceding retro&s;pect.</P>
<P>In 1488, as has already been ob&s;erved, the titled nobles of Scotland amounted to about forty. The ducal denominations were mo&s;tly confined to the royal family: the others were earls and lords. But the&s;e greater barons had no privileges above the &s;maller: all were <HI>peers,</HI> or <HI>pares,</HI> in courts of ju&s;|tice: a <HI>lord</HI> and a <HI>lard</HI> are the &s;ame, and the latin only admitted <HI>dominus</HI> for either: the <HI>lard,</HI> or <HI>laird,</HI> was de&s;igned from his e&s;tate; and his wife was <HI>lady</HI> by the &s;ame de&s;ignation even down to modern times. For di&s;tinction the titled lords were created and &s;tyled lords of parliament. While there was no hou&s;e of commons, there was no hou&s;e of peers: every landed gentleman holding of the crown might &s;it and vote; but he could not be con&s;trained to attend except his e&s;tate amounted to a certain &s;um.</P>
<P>Had the great plan of James I been carried into execution, as much additional re&s;pect would have accrued to the peers, as to the commons: greater lu&s;tre, more important privileges, would have ari&s;en to the former, as well as to the latter. A di&s;tinct legi&s;lative capacity, a marked line of &s;eparation from the landed gentlemen, might have gratified the pride, and &s;timulated the abilities, of the peers; while the e&s;quires, united with the burge&s;&s;es, might have learned by degrees the eminent advantages which commerce and agriculture derive from each other.</P>
<P>The le&s;&s;er barons or <HI>lairds,</HI> corre&s;ponding with the Engli&s;h LORDS of manors, form &s;uch a &s;ingular and amphibious cla&s;s, in the Scoti&s;h parliament, that they excite curio&s;ity and di&s;|qui&s;ition. The roll of parliament, 1472, will give us an idea
<PB N="360" REF="375">of their proportion to the other members; which &s;eems to have greatly exceeded that of the roll of 1365 above-mentioned.</P>

<P><PB N="362" REF="377">In this parliament the le&s;&s;er barons almo&s;t equal in number the clergy and peers. The rolls indeed &s;eem imperfect, for none, apparently, remains which enumerates more than about eighty member; while, in a &s;tature of 1458, they are e&s;ti|mated, as we have &s;een, at about one hundred and ninety: and this, though one of the mo&s;t ample, omits no le&s;s than twenty of the burghs. But it is not the number of the <HI>lairds,</HI> or tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> which &s;urprizes: it is their fewne&s;s which merits inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>An idle tradition prevailed in the middle ages, that one of our monarchs di&s;tributed all the lands of Scotland among his great barons, re&s;erving none for him&s;elf, except the Moot-hill of Scone. This tradition, though vague, expre&s;&s;ed the &s;tate of the country, chiefly divided into large territories, the poten|tates of which held of the king; while their numerous va&s;&s;als, enjoying greater or &s;maller allotments, held of their lords. Hence the numerous charters <HI>of confirmation</HI> in our records, only lending the royal &s;anction to charters granted by the ba|rons: and a li&s;t of the tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> including even the &s;maller, would not, it is believed, for the writers who might be expected to illu&s;trate this topic, prefer declamation on the feudal &s;y&s;tem; a rich mine, but already exhau&s;ted by the la|bours of Monte&s;quieu, and other able authors<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The learned Craig ought to be named among the chief, his work <HI>De Feud's</HI> being the exuberant, and often the <HI>&s;ilent,</HI> &s;ource of the riches of more modern authors.

<P>In England the <HI>baron</HI> was a <HI>lord,</HI> a peer: in Scotland he was only a <HI>laird,</HI> a man of landed property: the word indeed originally only implies a man of courage, a chief<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Leges Langob. and in modern Spani&s;h <HI>Varon</HI> is either A MAN or a no|ble; not to mention the French <HI>baron et femme.</HI> In like manner the term <HI>Iarl,</HI> or Earl, apparently introduced by the Dani&s;h conque&s;t of England in the eleventh century, only &s;ignified originally a <HI>man;</HI> thus <HI>Iarl&mdash;wagh,</HI> via viri.

From Dome&s;day Book it appears that the immediate va&s;&s;als of the crown amounted, after the conque&s;t, to about &s;even hundred, exclu&s;ive of the ecce&s;ia&s;tic fees<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Dalr. on feudal property, 313.</NOTE>: of the&s;e &s;even hundred a few were earls and lords; the remainder would in Scotland have been termed barons or lairds. In the latter kingdom it may &s;eem that the immediate va&s;&s;als of the crown could not, before the reign of David I, exceed two hundred; and the profu&s;e do|nations of that prince to the church mu&s;t have dimini&s;hed the number of lay-fees.</P>
<P>The&s;e va&s;&s;als of the crown, or tenants <HI>in capite,</HI> were how|ever &s;peedily to be multiplied by various cau&s;es. New dona|tions of the regal deme&s;ne, forfeitures of great fiefs, afterwards divided into &s;maller, gifts of land by va&s;&s;als them&s;elves to their followers, coheir&s;hip, and at length purcha&s;e by the ac|qui&s;itions of commerce or chance, were among the operations which increa&s;ed the number of the va&s;&s;als in chief. Hence in the reign of Henry III of England, repre&s;entatives appear for the counties at the &s;ame time with tho&s;e of the burghs: and &s;o rapid was the progre&s;s of liberty in that fortunate kingdom that, from the fir&s;t appearance of repre&s;entation for the con|ties,
<PB N="364" REF="379">all and had a right to vote who held lands, or tenements, of whatever lord or &s;uperior; while in Scotland, when this re|pre&s;entation was attempted in 1428 and e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1587, the privilege, or &s;ervitude, of voting was confined to the free|holders of the crown.</P>
<P>One great cau&s;e which defeated the repre&s;entation for coun|ties in Scotland, and rendered even that for the burghs irregu|lar and incomplete, was the avarice of the freeholders, and citizens, which &s;hrunk from paying the <HI>co&s;tage,</HI> or &s;alaries of the repre&s;entatives. And they not only abhorred the duty, or bondage as they &s;uppo&s;ed, of &s;itting in parliament, but they even dete&s;ted the trouble of giving their votes. Another cau&s;e was, that the members of parliament had no privileges what|ever, not even the peers them&s;elves con&s;idered in that capa|city; while the political wi&s;dom of England had &s;timulated emulation, and had in&s;pired re&s;pect for the meane&s;t member of the national council, by the freedom from arre&s;t, and other immunities. Had James I, in his eager wi&s;h to render the nation free, indu&s;trious, and happy, a&s;&s;igned &s;pecial privileges to the repre&s;entatives of counties and burghs, it is probable he might have &s;ucceeded in e&s;tabli&s;hing two hou&s;es, and an ex|cellent con&s;titution. The &s;truggle is &s;ingular; the court in|&s;i&s;ted on diffu&s;ing &s;ome degree of freedom; and the people oppo&s;ed their deliverance with &s;urprizing zeal and per&s;ever|ance.</P>
<P>To return to the con&s;ideration of the <HI>barons</HI> or <HI>lairds,</HI> they were hardly to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, either in common or legal language, from the titled nobility. They were not only de|nominated from their e&s;tates; but to a late period they u&s;ed a titular &s;ignature, as well as the peers. <HI>Peer,</HI> and <HI>peerage,</HI> do not indeed appear to be Scoti&s;h terms: in England, when a lord of parliament was created, he was &s;tyled a PEER, but
<PB N="365" REF="380">there &s;eems no ve&s;tige of this u&s;age in Scotland; and there being no hou&s;e of peers or equals, to which he could be called, the nobles were peers of the realm, and not peers of parlia|ment. The term peerage is indeed vague, even at pre&s;ent; an Engli&s;h peerage is an inelective hereditary right to &s;it in parliament; while a Scoti&s;h peerage is only a right to vote for &s;ixteen repre&s;entatives<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The reader who is de&s;irous to &s;ee a clear &s;ubject embarra&s;&s;ed by a &s;trange mixture of new names and old ideas, and old names and new ideas, joined with a &s;imilar confu&s;ion of chronology, may con&s;ult Wallace on ancient Peer|ages, Edin. 1785, 8vo.</NOTE>. In &s;trict propriety the word has no connection with the parliament or general council; it is an honour at fir&s;t territorial, and pa&s;&s;ing with the land like a Scoti&s;h <HI>laird&s;hip;</HI> afterwards per&s;onal and hereditary; but ever implying power, territory, rank, precedence, inve&s;titure by the monarch, di&s;tinction of &s;eat and dre&s;s on &s;olemn occa&s;ions. In France the twelve peers &s;eem ot have &s;ucceeded the <HI>comites,</HI> or companion of the early monarchs, after the latter title had dwindled into the <HI>count</HI> or earl; and acknowledging no &s;upe|rior but the &s;overeign, they bore the humble and proud title of peers or equals. The Normans introduced the term into England; where it was to be extended to all who were &s;o|lemnly ennobled by the king, and thereby attained a right of &s;itting in the upper hou&s;e, only known in that country, and thence &s;tyled the Hou&s;e of Peers. But in Scotland the peers having at no period a &s;eparate hou&s;e, and after the extinction of the Scoti&s;h parliament by the Union, having only a right to &s;elect &s;ixteen of their number; the title remains in its original &s;tate, quite di&s;tinct from any reference to parliament.</P>
<P>The <HI>Banrents,</HI> or Bannerets, were an intermediate order, between the peers and the <HI>larids;</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing e&s;tates of &s;uch ex|tent, and of &s;o many knights fees, that they could lead a great
<PB N="366" REF="381">number of followers to the field, whence they had a title to di&s;play a <HI>banner</HI><NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The <HI>&s;tandard</HI> was confined to the king or general; the banner to peers and potent chiefs: the <HI>guidon</HI> was a &s;mall flag with two peaks or points, and &s;upe|rior to the <HI>pencill</HI> or penon which every knight might put on his lance.

They were al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by their pe|culiar <HI>en&s;eigny,</HI> or <HI>cri de guerre;</HI> and by &s;upporters to their armorial bearings.</P>
<P>But the Scoti&s;h <HI>barons,</HI> or <HI>lairds,</HI> had none of the&s;e high di&s;tinctions. However &s;mall their freeholds, they had a title to &s;it in parliament, as appears from the above acts, exempting tho&s;e under a certain revenue from any con&s;traint for appear|ance. In civil matters they could decide que&s;tions of debt, and many of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion within their baronies; regulate work and wages; and enforce the payment of their rents. All criminal ca&s;es fell under the cogni&s;ance of the <HI>laird,</HI> except trea&s;on, and the four pleas of the crown: he had the power of pit and gallows, or drowning female and hanging male cul|prits, convicted of theft or robbery; and his juri&s;diction com|prized many penal &s;tatutes<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Er&s;kine Principles of Sc.

<P>On the other hand numerous were the di&s;tinctions between the lord and the <HI>laird.</HI> The latter had no permanent denomi|nation, no per&s;onal honour, his exi&s;tence was merely territo|rial: he had no &s;olemn inve&s;titure, no fixed rank, no prece|dence, nor was he addre&s;&s;ed with any appropriated term. His tenants indeed called him <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> not landlord, but this was a &s;lavi&s;h relique of the days of villenage: and hence apparently the Scoti&s;h phra&s;e of <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> for the heir apparent to an e&s;tate, thus Ma&s;ter of Huntley, of Darnley, and the like, frequent in our hi&s;tory and records, and &s;till retained where there is no &s;econd title.</P>

While the famous &s;tatute of <HI>Quia Emptores</HI> was to diffu&s;e wealth and cultivation through England; in the adjacent kingdom the heritable proprietor was to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the heritable &s;terility of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and by a firm entail of indolence and poverty. Yet by degrees com|merce and indu&s;try were to a&s;&s;ert their rights, private vices were to become public benefits; and landed prodigality was to mini&s;ter to the national advancement. And though many of the purcha&s;ed lands held of the under lords, there is little room to doubt that the freeholders of the crown were increa&s;ed by this progre&s;s of &s;ociety: but a ju&s;t e&s;timate of their number could only be formed from an enumeration of the charters in the regi&s;ter at various periods, a toil perhaps &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the value of the information.</P>
<P>That no repre&s;entatives for the counties appeared till 1587, is &s;ufficiently clear from the &s;ilence of the &s;tatutes, and records: and the act of James II, concerning the parliamentary dre&s;s, is mute concerning the commi&s;&s;ioners of the &s;hires, or even the le&s;&s;er barons in general, though mo&s;t particular in regard to the earls, lords, and burge&s;&s;es. It is hence to be inferred that the <HI>lairds</HI> appeared in parliament in their u&s;ual dre&s;s; nor does it appear that, in latter times, the repre&s;entatives of &s;hires were di&s;tingui&s;hable by their apparel from the burge&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>To clo&s;e this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion concerning the <HI>le&s;&s;er barons,</HI> the length of which can only be excu&s;ed by their importance in the national and con&s;titutional &s;cale, and the &s;ingularity of
<PB N="369" REF="384">their rank in &s;ociety, when compared with more civilized go|vernments, it &s;hall only be further ob&s;erved, that the term <HI>laird</HI> has become of no re&s;pect, and is even ironically applied to the <HI>portioner</HI> of land, who&s;e e&s;tate is half a field, but who joins the indu&s;try of an arti&s;an to the healthy pur&s;uits of his little agriculture. For the denomination, being territorial, is only honourable in proportion to the territory; while the Engli&s;h term E&s;quire, a&s;&s;igned to any man who bears a &s;hield, or in other words has an armorial blazon, is a per&s;onal di&s;tinction, extended to opulence, to eminence of talents, to fortunate in|du&s;try, as well as to con&s;iderable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of land.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing to the la&s;t divi&s;ion of the national council, the Burge&s;&s;es, it is fir&s;t to be ob&s;erved that the Royal Burghs alone had a right, or rather, to &s;peak in the language of the times, were burdened by their tenures from the crown with the heavy duty of &s;ending repre&s;entatives to parliament. The Burghs of Barony, or tho&s;e that held of great barons whether temporal or &s;piritual, were exempt from this &s;lavery: Gla&s;gow for in|&s;tance though a burgh of &s;ome con&s;equence, even then, as holding of the bi&s;hop, &s;ent no commi&s;&s;ioner. To tho&s;e already mentioned, in the above roll, may be added Berwick, Jedburgh, Selkirk, Peebles, Lanark, Dunbar, Kinghorn, Forfar, Brechin, Wigton, Kirkudbright, Irvin, Dunbarton, North Berwick, In-verkeithing, Coupar, Perth, Montro&s;e, and others<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">See Carm. 59, part. 1479. In 1682 they amounted to &s;ixty. Pre&s;ent Skate of Scotland, London 1682, 8vo, p. 131&mdash;134.</NOTE>; &s;o that the repre&s;entatives for the burghs might have amounted to between thirty and forty, if another &s;ingular practice had not prevailed, that of many of the burghs appointing the repre&s;en|tatives of the others to be proxies; every method of ex|emption from attendance being &s;edulou&s;ly practi&s;ed, in order to avoid the trouble and expence.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="385">As the &s;e&s;&s;ion of a parliament commonly la&s;ted only a few days, the chief magi&s;trates of the burghs could attend, without a long ab&s;ence from their duty; and it appears that they were generally the repre&s;entatives. The oligarchic form of muni|cipality, introduced by James III, nece&s;&s;arily confined the elec|tion to the town-council, the body of the burge&s;&s;es or freemen being excluded. Hence it is computed that there are not in Scotland, at this day, above three thou&s;and voters for national repre&s;entatives, either of counties or towns<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Dalr. 330.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the earlie&s;t Scoti&s;h parliaments, of which we have any record, it appears that deputies for the burghs attended, to &s;ettle the proportion of taxes, which the towns were to bear: and it is not improbable that the magi&s;trates of the principal burghs may be included in the <HI>&s;apientes, probi homines,</HI> or <HI>preud-hommes,</HI> and <HI>tota communitas regni,</HI> of the mo&s;t ancient national councils<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">For tho&s;e of Scotland &s;ee the Statuta Willielmi, et Alexandri Secundi, apud Skene Reg. Maj.</NOTE>. Many ancient Engli&s;h cu&s;toms may be traced in more modern Scoti&s;h u&s;ages; and for this rea&s;on the &s;tudy of the latter is important to &s;cience in both kingdoms. That the magi&s;trates of the chief towns were, in an appro|priated &s;en&s;e, members of the national council before the reign of Henry III in England, and Robert I in Scotland, there is unhappily no po&s;itive proof: but that they attended, e&s;pecially in ca&s;es of taxation, and probably at the bar, there is &s;ome proof, and every rea&s;on to infer. In Scotland there were neither towns nor commerce, till a comparatively late period; but the u&s;ages are evidently of Engli&s;h origin, con&s;tant inter|cour&s;e, and an amity &s;eldom interrupted, having prevailed between the nations, till the ba&s;e and unkingly conduct of Edward I forced Scotland into the arms of France. Now in
<PB N="371" REF="386">England, as in other European kingdoms, no repre&s;entatives from towns could appear in early times; and the numerous barbaric codes of laws, though mo&s;t minute in other points, are, it is believed, completely &s;ilent, not only on this head, but on municipal regulation. The rea&s;on is clear; it was be|cau&s;e the barbarians who overturned the Roman empire de|te&s;ted the civic life; and pre&s;erved their ancient rural manners, and occupations. The towns being conquered, had no right to expect a repre&s;entation in the national a&s;&s;emblies of their victors, held in ample plains under the canopy of heaven; and it was to the contempt and indifference of the conquerors, that they were commonly indebted for &s;uch privileges as they retained, as the right of electing their own magi&s;trates, and other minute reliques of freedom. When the Saxons, when the Normans conquered England, the &s;ame cau&s;es mu&s;t have operated; the Engli&s;h repre&s;entatives of London mu&s;t have made a &s;trange appearance in an a&s;&s;embly of Norman free|holders, to who&s;e language and laws they were ab&s;olute &s;tran|gers. But the magi&s;trates might be called to the bar, to advi&s;e and give their con&s;ent to the be&s;t manner of proportioning a tax, and enforcing its collection in their re&s;pective towns, the language of money being very audible and clear.</P>
<P>On looking into the hi&s;tory of the Scoti&s;h parliaments, we accordingly &s;ind the burge&s;&s;es &s;pecially mentioned on the oc|ca&s;ion of a tax impo&s;ed by William<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Fordun, I, 529, A. D. 1211.</NOTE>. Even in the reign of James II, as will afterwards appear in this retro&s;pect, they &s;at at the bar of the national council: in that of James III &s;everal acts bear to be pa&s;&s;ed by the clergy and lords: in 1504 a &s;pe|cial &s;tatute appears, ordaining "that the commi&s;&s;aries and heads-men of the burghs be warned when taxes or contribu|tions
<PB N="372" REF="387">are given, to have their advice therein, as one of the three e&s;tates of the realm<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Cap. 85.</NOTE>." In 1560 we find ten <HI>provo&s;ts</HI> of the chief towns among the lords of the articles<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on Append. N^o IV.</NOTE>. As the &s;tatutes are &s;ilent concerning the mode of election, and repre|&s;entation, for burghs, it would &s;eem that one or two of the magi&s;trates were nominated by the others, or by the council.</P>
<P>The Royal Burghs were indeed bound by their tenures, as holding in chief of the crown, to attend the parliament; but as proxies were allowed, and the fine it&s;elf for ab&s;ence was only ten pounds, the tenure was neglected and illuded. Nor could the incorporation of a burgh by royal charter be an u&s;age of much antiquity in Scotland, perhaps not more an|cient than the reign of David I.</P>
<P>So much for the Burge&s;&s;es, the only real commons of Scot|land; the le&s;&s;er barons having weakly preferred an in&s;ignificant mixture with the peers to the noble ambition of heading a &s;e|parate a&s;&s;embly. Modern party has embroiled many of the que&s;tions on this &s;ubject; a whig wi&s;hing to increa&s;e the anti|quity and power of the commons, while a tory endeavours to dimini&s;h them: but to plain &s;en&s;e, and cool rea&s;on, the topic is only important as illu&s;trative of hi&s;tory; nor can the di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of barbaric cu&s;toms hinder, or advance, the cau&s;e of en|lightened freedom.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of men, which compo&s;ed the three e&s;tates of the national council, one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting objects in modern hi&s;tory; &s;ome other parti|culars remain to be &s;tated, in order to pre&s;ent clear informa|tion concerning its con&s;titution, and procedure.</P>
<P>The number of the members, we have &s;een, amounted to about one hundred and ninety; but from the rolls there never

Even in modern times to &s;ecure the attendance of a certain number, in a na|tional council, the members ought to double that number. James I ordered, in 1426, that no prelate, earl, baron, or free|holder, &s;hould appear by a procurator, except on proving a lawful cau&s;e of ab&s;ence<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Cap. 52. The act of 1504 allows procurators to appear for the le&s;&s;er Barons. Mr. Wight, p. 57, &s;eems rightly to infer that both the &s;tatutes, of 1458, and 1504, only ab&s;olve the per&s;ons from attendance, on condition that they &s;ent proxies.</NOTE>. It would &s;eem that the procurators are omitted in the rolls, and often indeed one member might appear for many; but &s;ometimes a lawyer was proxy for an ab&s;ent peer; and the omi&s;&s;ion might be according to the forms, or intended to di&s;countenance the practice. At any rate the omi&s;&s;ion of the procurators mu&s;t con&s;iderably abbreviate the rolls of parliament.</P>
<P>It was a royal prerogative to &s;ummon the general council, which was done by letters, under the &s;ignet, to the clerical members, and greater barons; and by precepts from chancery to the &s;heriffs, for general &s;ummon&s;es to all members re&s;ident in each &s;hire. During a minority this prerogative was exerted by the council of regency; but few or no permanent laws were ever pa&s;&s;ed, except when the &s;overeign had attained the years of majority pre&s;cribed by law.</P>
<P>The members having, a day or two before, arrived in the city or town where the parliament was to be held, on the morning of the meeting they a&s;&s;embled at an appointed place, and proceeded on hor&s;eback in grant &s;tate to their hall. This proce&s;&s;ion was called the Riding of the Parliament, and was
<PB N="374" REF="389">a &s;ingularity retained to the late&s;t period of the Scoti&s;h legi&s;la|ture. Amid the &s;ound of numerous trumpets, and the armo|rial di&s;plays of heralds, fir&s;t appeared the commi&s;&s;ioners of the burghs, then the le&s;&s;er barons; followed by the lords, the bi&s;hops, the earls, the archbi&s;hops, the dukes. Three cho&s;en peers bore the crown, &s;ceptre, and &s;word, before the monarch, who was attended by his guards.

<P>The clergy probably took their &s;eats on the right, the peers on the left of the throne, as in England: and &s;o numerous were the former, that the le&s;&s;er barons pre&s;ent would merely complete the left ranks. At the bottom, near, or perhaps without, the bar, &s;at the commi&s;&s;ioners of the burghs.

<P>In Cal. B. V, 266, is an account of the Scoti&s;h parliament in the reign of James VI.

Parliament was either <HI>de&s;erted</HI> or <HI>current;</HI> the former ca&s;e required a proclamation of forty days before another could be held; the latter only of fif|teen days.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The roll being called, and &s;ome other formalities arranged, the chancellor, or &s;ometimes the &s;ecretary, made a &s;hort &s;peech; and as they were commonly churchmen, it was in the nature
<PB N="375" REF="390">of a &s;ermon of the time, &s;ea&s;oned with latin quotations from &s;cripture. The three e&s;tates then proceeded to their chief of|fice, the appointment of commitees of ju&s;tice, and of the ar|ticles; who being &s;elected, the other members were at liberty to depart to their re&s;pective homes: and often did not a&s;&s;emble till next year, when they gave their &s;anction to the laws pre|pared by the committees. But it al&s;o often happened that the &s;tatutes and ordinances were already fa&s;hioned by the chancel|lor, and other officers of &s;tate, or could ea&s;ily be forwarded; &s;o that the members remained in the town, and even continued their &s;e&s;&s;ion occa&s;ionally from five to fifteen days, the la&s;t of which was appropriated to the pronunciation of the deci&s;ions of the committee of ju&s;tice, in pre&s;ence of the whole hou&s;e<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The vote of <HI>Non liquet</HI> was latterly allowed, as in the Roman &s;enate; but the u&s;ual votes were <HI>approve</HI> or <HI>not approve;</HI> (Pre&s;.

<P>As the members were inelective, the commi&s;&s;ioners of the burghs alone excepted, the prorogation, or di&s;&s;olution, of the parliament could not be alternatives of great con&s;equence. In England, at this period, a parliament &s;eldom &s;at above one &s;e&s;&s;ion of twenty or thirty days; but &s;ometimes three &s;e&s;&s;ions were known. The general form of the Scoti&s;h parliament &s;eems to have been annual; and the magi&s;trates, who repre|&s;ented the towns, being commonly of yearly continuance in office, it may be difficult to point out an in&s;tance of a proro|gation from one year to another: though tho&s;e of two or three months in the &s;ame year are not unfrequent. A curious in|&s;tance of the prorogation of a parliament, followed by its di&s;|&s;olution, occurs in the records. In the turbulent la&s;t year of the reign of James III, a parliament met in January, and was prorogued to May. But on the 17th February 1488, James i&s;&s;ued the following order. "We do you to wit that our &s;ove|reign
<PB N="376" REF="391">lord, by the advice of his council, has for certain rea|&s;onable and great cau&s;es, de&s;erted and di&s;&s;olved his parliament, which was formerly prorogued till the fifth day of May next to come: and has ordained a new general parliament, to be &s;et, and proclaimed to be holden at Edinburgh the twelfth day of May next to come, with continuation of days; and general precepts to pa&s;s to all lords, prelates, barons, frecholders, and commi&s;&s;aries; and with &s;pecial letters under his &s;ignet to all the prelates, and great lords of his realm, to &s;hew and declare to them the cau&s;e of the &s;itting of his &s;aid parliament." The&s;e &s;pecial letters it is to be pre&s;umed, James did not direct to his enemies: and it is even probable that they were never &s;ent to members in the oppo&s;ition; an omi&s;&s;ion which might be regarded as a hint that their ab&s;ence would be more agree|able.</P>
<P>After the parliament, the Privy Council attracts the greate&s;t attention by its dignity and importance. The nature of this meeting has been already explained in the preceding retro&s;pect, where it is ob&s;erved that it &s;ucceeded the <HI>Aula Regis,</HI> or King's Court. This court, anciently held in a hall of the palace, has been by &s;ome authors confounded with the nationa coun|cil; and the vague &s;ynonymes, and impure latinity, of the writers of the middle ages, have &s;ometimes blended the terms <HI>curia</HI> and <HI>con&s;ilium,</HI> &s;o as to occa&s;ion a doubt whether the lat|ter be a general or privy council; and whether the former be a &s;enate or parliament in the cla&s;&s;ic acceptation, or an affected &s;ub&s;titute for the <HI>curtis</HI> or court of the king. The explanations of glo&s;&s;ari&s;ts are al&s;o arbitrary, and often derived from a &s;ingle &s;entence, without con&s;idering the &s;cope of preceding and &s;uc|ceeding paragraphs, or the affected &s;en&s;e in which a particular<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Kaims' E&s;&s;ay on Brit. Ant. p. 54.</NOTE>
<PB N="377" REF="392">writer may u&s;e a particular expre&s;&s;ion. That the king's court was merely of con&s;ultation, and of judicature in particular ca&s;es, like the &s;ucceeding privy council, there is every rea&s;on to infer; and if the parliament be &s;tyled the royal court, in barbaric latinity, it is an abu&s;e of terms. The king's <HI>baron-courts</HI> were a kind of inque&s;ts, con&s;i&s;ting of the great officers of the crown, and other chief barons to judge on important crimes and cau&s;es: even they differed much from the courts held by the barons them&s;elves, becau&s;e the monarch, however controuled and impoveri&s;hed by the great barons, yet main|tained during the feudal ages a &s;ublime and &s;uperlative charac|ter in the con&s;titution, as the fountain of honour, the general, and chief magi&s;trate, of the &s;tate. But from the&s;e courts the parliament, or general council, was di&s;tingui&s;hed in many ways. 1. It &s;ucceeded the general a&s;&s;emblies of the German tribes, mentioned by Tacitus, who &s;ays that on &s;maller mat|ters, or particular ca&s;es, the nobles met and decided; while in larger the whole community a&s;&s;embled to determine on affairs of general intere&s;t<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Germ. c. xi.</NOTE>. The former was the king's baron-court; the latter a parliament: the former was a meeting of the notables; the latter of the &s;tates general. 2. The <HI>aula regis,</HI> or king's baron-court, though perhaps the former con|&s;i&s;ted only of the chief officers of &s;tate, the latter added the great barons, yet whether the &s;ame, or di&s;tinct, never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any legi&s;lative power. 3. The &s;tates general often oppo&s;ed the royal will; and the Engli&s;h parliament even depo&s;ed Richard II; attributes which no fancy can a&s;cribe to the king's own courts, which exi&s;ted only in virtue of his authority. 4. The king's courts met in his palaces, while no parliament ever &s;at in a royal man&s;ion; but in convents, abbeys, guild|halls,
<PB N="378" REF="393">and other detached places<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Dr. Gilbert Stuart on the Public Law and Con&s;titution of Scotland, p. 81, 107, edit. 1784. It is to be regreted that the u&s;eful information, and &s;olid argument, &s;ometimes pre&s;ented in this work, &s;hould be di&s;torted by the author's per&s;onal animo&s;ity again&s;t Dr. Robert&s;on a writer of great talents. Dr. Stuart's &s;tyle is al&s;o too turgid, and declamatory, to pre&s;ent clear information on ob&s;cure topics; and the abominable plan, or rather confu&s;ion, invented by Bayle, who emptied his common-place book on his dictionary, has been unhappily followed by both Robert&s;on and Stuart, in their enquiries on the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, &amp;c. while the &s;hort text, and long notes at the end, not only pre&s;ent a mo&s;t uncla&s;&s;ical mode of compo&s;ition, but &s;eem merely calculated to di&s;member and confu&s;e a &s;ubject, and oppre&s;s the patience of the reader.</NOTE>. It may be added that the tenure <HI>in capite</HI> was not a <HI>right</HI> to &s;it in parliament; it was on the contrary an <HI>obligation,</HI> in order that the national council, in which the &s;overeign appeared in his greate&s;t lu&s;tre, might be numerou&s;ly attended, and not exhibit &s;ymptoms of di&s;affec|tion by the rarity of the members. Before the feudal tenures prevailed, there can be no doubt but that every free-man had a right to appear in the general a&s;&s;embly, while the king's court was &s;acred to the chiefs; and &s;uppo&s;ing a barony allo|dial, or free from tenure, that circum&s;tance could not have operated again&s;t the right of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to appear in the na|tional council. But the &s;mall tribes, general a&s;&s;emblies, and idle life, of the ancient Germans, being followed by wide kingdoms in which no general a&s;&s;embly could be held, and by various occupations, it became nece&s;&s;ary to enforce attendance by tenure, and fines; means from which the que&s;tion of right, acquired by tenure, is extremely remote.</P>
<P>In the more ancient periods of Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory the kings were the chief judges in fact, as well as in law; and &s;at, at particular times, before a gate of the palace to hear and deter|mine cau&s;es, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the poor. This judicature was, in more poli&s;hed times, exerted by the monarch, in con|junction
<PB N="379" REF="394">with his privy council: but it was chiefly u&s;ed in puni&s;hing riots, and in other &s;pecial ca&s;es which demanded a &s;peedy remedy, and could not be deferred till the meeting of a parliament, the la&s;t court of re&s;ort. In the la&s;t century it was to u&s;urp the odious powers of a &s;tar-chamber, and its fall was matter of national exultation.</P>
<P>Such numerous minorities occur in the hi&s;tory of the Scoti&s;h monarchs, that the &s;tate of the government at tho&s;e periods de&s;erves much attention, and will be found explained in &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of the hi&s;torical narration. It appears that the privy council retained its chief powers under a Council of Regency, though the officers of &s;tate were often the principal members of both.</P>
<P>The&s;e Officers of State them&s;elves claim the next con&s;ide|ration; and their original importance in the government, and in the national hi&s;tory, demands that particular attention &s;hould be paid to their di&s;tinct duties and privileges.</P>
<P>In Scotland tho&s;e of chief con&s;equence at this period were the Lieutenant General of the Kingdom; the Steward, an office now held by the prince, and little exerted; the Con&s;ta|ble; the Mar&s;hall; the Chancellor; the Great Chamberlain; the Trea&s;urer; the Ju&s;ticiary; the Admiral; the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;ehold; the Privy Seal: the Comptroller; the Secre|tary. Among tho&s;e of &s;maller moment may be named the Clerk of the Regi&s;ter; the Trea&s;urer depute; the King's Ad|vocate; the Ju&s;tice Clerk; the King's Chamberlain.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t named of the&s;e offices, though almo&s;t unknown to all writers on our con&s;titution, was doubtle&s;s the &s;econd in the kingdom, and almo&s;t amounted to a regency during a weak reign or a minority. The Lieutenant General commanded the whole military array and force of the realm; being a &s;ub|&s;titute for the king him&s;elf, in his high capacity of general of
<PB N="380" REF="395">the nation. We have &s;een the ambitious Robert duke of Al|bany appear in the &s;ynonymous characters of lieutenant gene|ral, and governor of the kingdom, during the reign of Ro|bert III his brother. The potent earls of Douglas held this office in the minority of the &s;econd James: and it appears at intervals in the minority, and reign, of James V.</P>
<P>The &s;teward&s;hip, upon the acce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Stuart, merged in the principality. As David duke of Roth&s;ay was the &s;ole prince of that family, who came to majority after the acce&s;&s;ion of the family, the kings held the lands and privileges of the office: and James IV, in the parliament of 1490, was to order that all the free-holders of the &s;teward-lands "&s;hould appear an an&s;wer in the parliaments, and court of circuit, with their &s;uits and pre&s;ence, in a proper manner, till our &s;overeign lord have a &s;on, <HI>who &s;hall be immediate betwixt the king and them, to an&s;wer for them in the &s;aid parliaments, and courts of ju&s;ticiary:</HI> and &s;uit-rolls to be made thereupon, which &s;hall endure till the prince be born<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Cap. 16.

<P>The Con&s;table, originally as the name implies, the officer who had charge of the royal &s;tables, aro&s;e by degrees to be commander in chief under the &s;overeign; and continued in that high rank in France, even in the century now under view. His office in Scotland appears to have been vague, and titular; and was confined to the arrangement of the royal camp, a duty which &s;eldom occurred; to the reception of the
<PB N="381" REF="396">members of parliament at the door of their hall; and other objects of more lu&s;tre than utility. The noble family of Hay have long inherited this office; but we have &s;een it u&s;urped for a &s;ea&s;on by Boyd earl of Arran: yet he might perhaps ap|pear as a delegate for the aged earl of Errol.</P>
<P>The Mar&s;hall was ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e; as the Sene&s;chall, Styward, or Steward, was of the herds and flocks, the chief wealth of early times. The mar&s;hall ought to have arranged the army in battle: and he was the chief judge in the courts of chivalry, to determine points of honour and arms. He was al&s;o con&s;idered as a commander in the field; and the French marechals long retained the office. The hereditary mar&s;hal&s;y of Scotland continued for centuries in the family of Keith.</P>
<P>In the reign of James III the Chancellor aro&s;e to a precedence next to the prince of the blood. He was pre&s;ident and &s;peaker of parliament; examined, and pa&s;&s;ed, charters under the great &s;eal; was pre&s;ident of the privy council, where and in the committees of parliament, he exerci&s;ed great juridical func|tions. In &s;hort he had the chief rank in civil affairs, as the Lieutenant General had in military.</P>
<P>The Great Chamberlain, an office originally joined with that of Trea&s;urer, collected the royal revenues, and accompted for the expenditure. His juri&s;diction, as appears from the <HI>Iter Camerarii,</HI> was very exten&s;ive: and a great proportion of the revenue ari&s;ing from the cu&s;toms, and other duties paid by the royal burghs, they were committed to his particular charge. The management of the magi&s;trates, the u&s;e made of the pro|perty of the towns, the complaints and di&s;putes of the burge&s;&s;es and craft&s;men, the prices of provi&s;ions, the rules of barter and &s;ale, were among the objects of his authority<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See the Iter Camerarii in Skene; and Stuart, p. 33.</NOTE>. The collec|tion
<PB N="382" REF="397">of the royal revenues, and his power over the collectors, were al&s;o &s;ources of great influence. But the power of the Chamberlain over the Burghs was con&s;iderably re&s;tricted by the Court of Four Burghs, con&s;i&s;ting of commi&s;&s;ioners from the&s;e towns, who were &s;ummoned extraordinarily to hear appeals from the Chamberlain's circuit courts: but their ancient an|nual meeting was at Haddington<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">4to. Reg. f. 53.</NOTE>. The&s;e four burghs were Edinburgh, Stirling, Roxburgh, and Berwick; till the two latter falling into the hands of the Engli&s;h, it was ordered in the parliament of March 1368 that Lanark and Linlithgow be &s;ub&s;tituted, re&s;erving the rights of the former when re|taken<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The meeting of commi&s;&s;ioners of the burghs at In|verkeithing, authori&s;ed by James III to form mercantile re|gulations, &s;eems little to have increa&s;ed their importance in national &s;cale.</P>
<P>Latterly the office and power of the chamberlain were &s;hared by the Trea&s;urer, who received and expended &s;uch of the royal revenues, as belonged to the private expence of the king and his family. This office was introduced in 1424 by James I, on his return from England<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Crawf. Off. 252.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;ticiary was originally an officer of great power, as appears from the <HI>Iter Ju&s;ticiarii.</HI> His juri&s;diction was both civil and criminal; and he held circuit courts twice in the year. Trea&s;on, and the four pleas of the crown, were &s;pe|cially re&s;erved for his cognizance. But while the <HI>Ju&s;tiza</HI> of Arragon was to controul the monarchs, the Scoti&s;h Ju&s;ticiary never attained any preeminence above other officers of &s;tate. On the contrary his power was divided; there being often a Ju&s;ticiary for the counties &s;outh of the Forth and Clyde, and another for the north<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The &s;tatutes, by their frequent mention of the <HI>Ju&s;tices,</HI> &s;eem to indicate more; yet the deputies of the Ju&s;ticiaries may be implied.</NOTE>. Till the office was a&s;&s;igned heredi|tarily
<PB N="383" REF="398">to the noble family of Argyle by James V, it had been held by Sir Robert Lauder of Ba&s;s, and other names hardly known in hi&s;tory. And when Charles I withdrew it from Argyle it pa&s;&s;ed to Sir Thomas Hope, and afterwards to Sir Ludovic Stuart, men of talents, but far remote from the charac|ter of Spani&s;h <HI>Ju&s;tizas.</HI> It is &s;ometimes u&s;eful to collate do|me&s;tic cu&s;toms with foreign; but to form general views of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, and afterwards apply them to particular coun|tries, without a profound and laborious &s;tudy of their hi&s;tory, is a practice pregnant with errors. The feudal &s;y&s;tem of each European kingdom forms quite a di&s;tinct province. It is ea&s;ier indeed to draw materials from the literature of France, England, and other enlightened countries, than to &s;earch into ob&s;cure chronicles, old manu&s;cripts, and records, for the ge|nuine hi&s;tory of the Scoti&s;h con&s;titution. But an infinite con|fu&s;ion ari&s;es from an injudicious mixture of our hi&s;tory, and antiquities, even with tho&s;e of England: they ought &s;edulou&s;ly to be keeped apart; and the &s;killful reader may afterwards him&s;elf compare the topics, as treated by the hi&s;torians, law|yers, and antiquaries of the &s;i&s;ter nations.</P>
<P>It is to be regretted that we have &s;o few materials for the hi&s;tory of the next important office, that of Admiral: nor to the notices, &s;cattered in the hi&s;torical narrative, can any thing be here added. His juri&s;diction in maritime affairs, in the reign of James III, appears from the reference of the Engli&s;h to his judgment, concerning the capture of va&s;&s;els, and com|pen&s;ations on that account. In latter times he was Ju&s;tice-general upon the &s;eas, on fre&s;h waters within flood-mark, and in all harbours and creeks; his authority extended to all mari|time cau&s;es, comprehending que&s;tions of charter-parties, freights, &s;alvages, bottomries, and the like. His delegate is the judge of the high court of admiralty; and he may appoint
<PB N="384" REF="399">inferior deputies for di&s;tricts, but their &s;entences are &s;ubject to the revi&s;al of the high court. The admiral's juri&s;diction is &s;u|preme, and no que&s;tion can be transferred even to the &s;e&s;&s;ion, except by &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or reduction. Even many mercantile ca&s;es are by u&s;age &s;ubmitted to the admiral<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Er&s;kine, Principles, b. I, t. 3, &sect; 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The lord Privy Seal was an officer of con&s;iderable confi|dence, who put the royal &s;ignet to gifts of moveables, and other &s;mall grants not requiring &s;eizin. The Secretary wrote the royal letters, and managed &s;everal private departments of bu&s;ine&s;s; latterly he came to be an officer of high rank and importance, and his frequent acce&s;s to the royal ear gave him &s;uch influence that he almo&s;t rivalled the chancellor.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;ehold, <HI>Magi&s;ter Ho&s;pitii,</HI> &s;uperin|tended the royal dome&s;tics; and the Comptroller &s;hared the former offices of the chamberlain, and trea&s;urer, by regulating the expences and checking the accompt, and &s;upplying tem|porary advances of money.</P>
<P>The clerk of the regi&s;ter, or ma&s;ter of the rolls, had the care of the records and charters, and was clerk of parliament. The trea&s;urer-depute's duty is explained by his appellation. Royal cau&s;es, and pro&s;ecutions for crimes, e&s;pecially trea&s;on, were prerogatives of the king's advocate. The ju&s;tice-clerk, or clerk of ju&s;ticiary, was an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to the Ju&s;ticiary, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in points of law; and the lord ju&s;tice-clerk remains an office of importance.

<P>The court of Se&s;&s;ion had been in&s;tituted by James I in 1425. Its members were nominated by the king from the e&s;tates of parliament; and it was termed the Se&s;&s;ion becau&s;e its meet|ings were fixed at certain periods and places. James II or|dained particular regulations concerning this court; but as its members only &s;erved by rotation, and without &s;alary, it was at once ignorant and negligent; and was at length to be ex|changed for a daily council, appointed by the patriotic parlia|ment of 1504. It is to be regreted that James I did not found courts upon the Engli&s;h model; but perhaps the penury of the country afforded no funds for &s;alaries; perhaps the confined nature of the regal juri&s;diction, or &s;ome other circum&s;tances prevented &s;uch an attempt.</P>
<P>But the power of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the ju&s;ticiaries, the &s;heriff and coroner, was greatly re&s;tricted by the Regalities, or Lord&s;hips Palatine. Their juri&s;diction was royal, as the name implies; in civil affairs it equalled that of the &s;heriff; and in criminal it even comprized the four pleas of the crown, murder, rob|bery, rape, and fire-rai&s;ing, rivalling that of the Ju&s;ticiaries over every crime, except trea&s;on. The lord of regality could <HI>repledge,</HI> or reclaim, all criminals &s;ubject to his juri&s;diction, even from the courts of the Ju&s;ticiaries<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Er&s;kine Principles, b. I, t. 4, &sect; 4.</NOTE>. The&s;e extravagant grants, incompatible with the regular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, had been lavi&s;hed by the royal favour; or extorted by the
<PB N="389" REF="404">power of &s;everal great barons, when they had them&s;elves ex|pelled the Engli&s;h from their territories, or had rendered &s;ome eminent public &s;ervice. In 1455 an attempt was made to prevent any further grants of regality, by &s;ubjecting them to the con&s;ent of parliament<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Acts, c. 43.</NOTE>; but the practi&s;e was as inveterate as it was imprudent. The eccle&s;ia&s;tic lords, ever de&s;irous of exemption from any authority &s;ave that of the pope, are &s;up|po&s;ed to have &s;et the fir&s;t example of regalities; the temporal authority was delegated to a Bailiff, and often hereditary. Regalities continued to be granted, and confirmed; and the charters of hereditary &s;heriffdom to the peers and chiefs within their lord&s;hips, were almo&s;t tantamount, and became &s;o nu|merous as to extend over all the country. When regality lands were forfeited, the king appointed <HI>&s;tewards</HI> over them with &s;imilar powers; hence the hereditary &s;tewards of Strath|ern, Menteith, Annandale, Kirkudbright: while over baro|nial lands in the crown only <HI>Bailiffs</HI> were nominated, as in Kyle, Carric, Cunningham, and even the la&s;t-named offices were to be held hereditarily by peers. Happy country, thus filled with hereditary wi&s;dom and hereditary ju&s;tice!</P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t the Spiritual Courts be omitted, which before the reformation were to become great grievances. They origi|nally &s;prung from the confidence which piety repo&s;ed in the bi&s;hops; who were entru&s;ted with the care of e&s;tates, and orphan children. Hence their claim to judge in te&s;taments and legacies: and marriage being a &s;acrament, admini&s;tred by eccle&s;ia&s;tics &s;ince the twelfth century, prior to which it was merely a civil contract, all que&s;tions of divorce, breach of vows, and the like, pa&s;&s;ed to the eccle&s;ia&s;tic courts; from which no appeal lay except to the metropolitan, or finally to
<PB N="390" REF="405">the pontiff. Tythes and patronage were natural objects of church deci&s;ion, and notaries were appointed by the pope: but &s;candal, and any affairs confirmed by an oath, though ly|able to eccle&s;ia&s;tic juri&s;diction, might in all ages &s;eem &s;ecular que&s;tions. The bi&s;hops were &s;uppo&s;ed to be occupied in divine duties, and delegated their power to officials or commi&s;&s;aries: but the court was &s;tyled the Bi&s;hop's Court, or <HI>Curia Chri&s;ti|anitatis,</HI> and al&s;o the Con&s;i&s;torial Court, from the <HI>con&s;i&s;tory,</HI> or court of appeals held by the Roman emperors<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Er&s;kine, b.

<P>Two &s;tatutes of James II, concerning the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, de&s;erve particular attention. "The three e&s;tates have ordained that the Ju&s;tices on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Scoti&s;h &s;ea (the firth of Forth) hold their courts of circuit twice in the year; and in like manner on the north; according to ancient u&s;e and cu&s;tom. And &s;o al&s;o lords of regality within their re|galities, and the king's baillies of his regalities. And that the king him&s;elf, till the due cour&s;e of ju&s;tice be re&s;tored, pa&s;s to every town where the circuit is held, or to its vicinity, as his council &s;hall think convenient<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">1440, c. 5.</NOTE>."&mdash;"It is ordained and decreed that in all circuits of ju&s;tice, &s;heriff courts, and generally all courts &s;piritual and temporal, all per&s;ons, freeholders and others, &s;hall attend in a &s;ober and quiet manner. And that no man bring with him more per&s;ons than are in his daily hou&s;e|hold, and family &s;ervice. And when he arrives at his lodging, he and they &s;hall lay a&s;ide their weapons and armour, if any they bring; and wear no weapon except a knife. And if any be at open enmity, and alledge fear of his life, the &s;heriff &s;hall require <HI>law-burrows,</HI> or legal &s;urety, from both; and prohibit them in the royal name to di&s;turb the king's peace, on pain of incurring the law, which the king &s;hall execute without re|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="391" REF="406">on the infringer. If the &s;heriff be negligent he &s;hall be puni&s;hed, according to the &s;tatute ordained for reforming the faults of officers of ju&s;tice<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">1458, c. 82.</NOTE>." In 1487 the lords and commons in vain engaged not to &s;upport any criminal friends, or rela|tions, at the bar: but the offence was to continue common in the &s;ucceeding century<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">cap. 98.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>James III in 1469 ordered that if the Ju&s;tice, Sheriff, Stew|ard, Bailie, or Baron, Provo&s;t or Baillie of burghs, refu&s;e to execute ju&s;tice the complainant &s;hall repair to the king in council, who &s;hall puni&s;h the offending magi&s;trate by the pe|nalties there mentioned<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">cap. 27.</NOTE>. Among the grievances of this reign the abu&s;es of the court of Se&s;&s;ion appear to have been one of the chief. The want of regular intermediate civil courts, between that of the &s;heriff and the king's council, mu&s;t have led to much inconvenience, and maladmini&s;tration; the power of the privy council having been ever e&s;teemed one of the grand defects of the Scoti&s;h con&s;titution, being an arbitrary &s;tar-chamber un|controuled by genuine ju&s;tice or equity. With all its imper|fections the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of all the members of parliament in rotation, mu&s;t have been an in&s;titution far more free and impartial.</P>
<P>Some regulations appear concerning inque&s;ts, and juries on criminal cau&s;es; but the want of juries in civil ca&s;es was to continue a di&s;graceful contra&s;t between Engli&s;h and Scoti&s;h juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>Among the means of pre&s;erving the public peace, the let|ters of <HI>Law-burrows</HI> mu&s;t not be omitted. The term is de|rived from <HI>borgh,</HI> a pledge or &s;urety, which any per&s;on, in fear of another's violence, had a title to demand, that he &s;hould not be injured in his per&s;on, family, or e&s;tate<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Er&s;kine, b. iv, t. 1, &sect; 21.</NOTE>. He who re|fu&s;ed
<PB N="392" REF="407">to grant &s;uch &s;ecurity was lyable to high penalties: when granted, the &s;ureties became amenable in the terms of the fol|lowing &s;tatute of 1466. "Concerning law-burrows it is en|acted, that if they be infringed on any bi&s;hop, abbot, or prelate of the church, earl, or lord of parliament, with their per&s;onal hurt, or that of their &s;ervants, the &s;ureties of the infringer &s;hall pay to our &s;overeign lord a &s;ine of one hundred pounds. If on any knight, baron, &s;quire, or clergyman of large bene|fice, fifty pounds. If on a burge&s;s, yeoman, or prie&s;t, thirty pounds. Together with due compen&s;ation to the party injured. Unle&s;s the &s;ureties produce the infringer before the king or the &s;heriff, within forty days. The king to have the fines of all law-burrows broken, that &s;hall fall within the juri&s;diction of his own officers, either in town or country: and the lords of regalities and baronies to have tho&s;e taken in their lands, by them or their officers, according to their ancient infeof|ments and privileges<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">cap. 5.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>One of the la&s;t &s;tatutes of James III is in the following terms. "The three e&s;tates have committed the full power of the whole parliament to the per&s;ons under-written, (they do not appear,) to advi&s;e, confer, and report to the next parlia|ment or general council, concerning the reduction of the king's laws, <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem,</HI> acts, &s;tatutes, and other books, to be bound in one volume, and authorized; and the others to be de&s;troyed. Four per&s;ons to be appointed for each of the three e&s;tates. The prelates to bear the expence of the clerical mem|bers: the barons of tho&s;e they &s;hall appoint: and the burghs that of their commi&s;&s;aries<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">1487, c. 115.</NOTE>." In like manner James I had ap|pointed a committee of &s;ix of each of the e&s;tates, to examine, and amend, "the books of law, that is to &s;ay <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem,</HI>
<PB N="393" REF="408">and <HI>Quoniam Attachiamenta</HI><NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">1426, c. 54.</NOTE>." It has been &s;hewn by &s;kilful judges that the work quaintly &s;tyled <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem</HI> is a tran&s;cript of Glanville's production. It was probably brought into Scotland by David II, who was greatly attached to Eng|land, and de&s;ired to bequeath his &s;ceptre to an Engli&s;h heir; and by an artful incorporation of &s;ome genuine laws of Daivd I, Scotland was prepared to receive it as a code of that illu&s;trious monarch. The feeble reigns of Robert II and III, and above all the tumultuous regencies of the dukes of Albany, had &s;o far obliterated the very memory of the laws, that the error had in the reign of the fir&s;t James taken deep root, and was to &s;hoot vigorou&s;ly<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><P>See Sir D. Dalrymple's Examination of &s;ome of the arguments for the an|tiquity of Regiam Maje&s;tatem, Edin. 1769, 4to; and the Ob&s;ervations on the Regiam Maje&s;tatem, 8vo, written by John David&s;on, E&s;q. a venerable promoter of the &s;tudy of Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory and antiquities, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted Dr. Robert&s;on in 1757, and continues his laudable re&s;earches though now in his &s;eventy-&s;eventh year.</P>
<P>While Sir David's arguments prove that the Regiam Maje&s;tatem could not exi&s;t before the reign of David II, he yet inclines to deny that it is &s;o late as that epoch, becau&s;e in the reign of James I it was e&s;teemed an ancient and au|thentic code: but this argument is an&s;wered in the text, and ignorant ages are &s;uch complete &s;trangers to any &s;tandard of antiquity, that the <HI>Leges Malcolmi,</HI> a then recent forgery, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be laws of Malcom I! To our old hi&s;to|rians, Fordun and Winton, the Regiam Maje&s;tatem is unknown, and it is mo&s;t probable that David II, when attempting to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his crown on a &s;on of Edward III, endeavoured &s;ilently to a&s;&s;imilate to Scoti&s;h laws with the Engli&s;h, by its introduction. Yet failing, the book lurked in MS. in one or two mona&s;teries, when James I, equally de&s;irous of benefiting his kingdom by an emulation of Engli&s;h polity, revived it: but Craig, a &s;uperlative judge, te&s;tifies that it never was a code of Scoti&s;h law, and that it has not even the lea&s;t connexion with the u&s;ages or foren&s;ic practice of Scotland. Lib. I, t. 8, &sect; 7.</P>
<P>Sir David's &s;econd argument, p. 36, that the Regiam Maje&s;tatem is more ancient than the time of David II, is &s;o &s;ingular that it &s;hall be tran&s;cribed entire.</P>
<P>"To this I add another chronological argument, which appears to have &s;ome weight. Cardinal Wardlaw, &s;ecretary to David II, died in 1389. His ne|phew, Henry Wardlaw, was promoted by him to the rectory of Kilbride, and the precentor&s;hip of the cathedral of Gla&s;gow. He was made bi&s;hop of St. Andrew's in 1404: and was chancellor of Scotland during the whole reign of James I. It will be admitted that the &s;tatute 54, par. 3. James I, 1425, [1426,] was either drawn up by him, or under his direction. Now as bi&s;hop Wardlaw was beneficed by his uncle, it is probable that he had come to man's e&s;tate before 1389, when his uncle died. Bi&s;hop Wardlaw, educated under the Cardinal &s;ecretary to David II, mu&s;t have known whether Regiam Maje&s;ta|tem was an ancient, or a very modern, compo&s;ition. This 54th &s;tatute &s;hows that he con&s;idered it as an ancient compo&s;ition: and hence, independent of all other arguments, there ari&s;es a cogent rea&s;on for believing that Regiam Maje&s;ta|tem was not compiled by the command of David II."</P>
<P>This argument is of too delicate, too feeble a texture: it forgets that the forgery might have happened early in the reign of David; that it might be a &s;tate &s;ecret; that the book may not even be older than the reign of James I, no more ancient MS. or reference being known; that this la&s;t prince was a rational admirer of Engli&s;h polity, and might wi&s;h to introduce it by a holy fraud; that the chancellor or &s;ecretary might in con&s;equence even interpolate, or alter, the &s;tatute, a complaint not unknown. But why wa&s;te di&s;cu&s;&s;ion? What mu&s;t be the reader's &s;urprize when he &s;ees this cogent argument completely overturned, only by reminding him that Henry Wardlaw, far from being chancellor, "during the whole reign of James I," <HI>never was chancellor at all?</HI> It was John Cameron, bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, who was chancellor during all that reign, (Crawf. Off. 25:) and the continued favour of James to this able and re&s;pecta|ble prelate, &s;ays more in his favour than is &s;ufficient to confute the fables of Boyce.</P>
<P>The Cromarty MS. of the Regiam Maje&s;tatem, in the Advocate's Library, concerning the antiquity of which Sir David he&s;itates to pronounce, is written about 1450, as appears from a &s;ac-&s;imile now before me, and from the opinion of a &s;kilful in&s;pector</P></NOTE>.

<P>To the ob&s;ervations formerly given on TACTICS little can be added. In a parliament of 1456 James II ordered, "that all men who have lands or goods be ready, hor&s;ed and ac|coutred as their lands and effects will afford, for the defence of the realm, at the command of the king . . . . . . .

By both par|liaments <HI>carts of war</HI> are ordered to be provided, which bore two patereros or &s;mall cannon; a machine probably derived from the Flemings or French; and which Henry VIII was, from the Scoti&s;h example, to introduce into the Engli&s;h army<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">They are repre&s;ented in the Coudray picture.

<P>While the defen&s;ive armour of the commons was the jack and targe, the leaders were arrayed in plate armour of com|plete &s;teel, which had &s;ucceeded the mail or interwoven rings. The helmet had a vi&s;or to turn up, for &s;ight; and a bever to turn down, to admit drink or food: &s;ometimes they both went up in divi&s;ions under the front of the helmet, &s;o as to leave the face open. The gorget, for the throat or neck, re&s;embled a flat ba&s;on open in the middle. The cuira&s;s covered the body; and had projections to defend the &s;houlders from the violent down-&s;troke of the axe or two handed &s;word, as the cre&s;t de|fended the head; the&s;e projections were termed pa&s;s-guards. To allow motion to the thighs the culet, or <HI>garde-des-reines,</HI> a &s;hort &s;teel petticoat was contrived. The arms were protected by the bra&s;ers; the thighs by the qui&s;&s;ets; the legs by the greaves; the gauntlets, &s;plents, and other pieces, need hardly be enumerated. Even the hor&s;e had his armour of appro|priated denominations; and all his front was particularly pro|tected from the &s;pear, or &s;word: the chafron, or cheveron, with a projecting point, covered his forehead; the poitrinal his brea&s;t; the criniere his neck: the buttock-pieces were

<P>The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of James I probably led to the in&s;titution of the royal guard, which appears under his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and James III; but which James IV was probably to di&s;continue, as on its revival by Albany, in the minority of the fifth James, it was regarded as a novelty. Concerning the number, or pay of the officers and &s;oldiers, nothing ari&s;es till the la&s;t men|tioned reign.</P>
<P>The Scoti&s;h guards of France were apparently in&s;tituted between the years 1453 and 1461; though they may be as ancient as 1445, when the <HI>gendarmerie</HI> were re&s;tored.

<P>If we except the royal guard, and a few occa&s;ional garri&s;ons on the frontiers, Scotland was a &s;tranger to any permanent troops, till the Re&s;toration. France, her ally, had long &s;et the example of &s;tanding forces, at fir&s;t the prop of a govern|ment, and latterly the ruin. The connexion between that country and Scotland may warrant a brief digre&s;&s;ion on the origin of an in&s;titution, which has produced &s;uch memorable effects on the political arrangements of Europe. The original
<PB N="401" REF="416">feudal array of France generally &s;erved for three months, on their own charges: the period was afterwards re&s;tricted to forty days, exclu&s;ive of the time occupied in joining the army or returning. About the year 1200 Philip Augu&s;tus had a paid militia, each fief furni&s;hing and defraying the expence of an apportioned number of &s;oldiers; the defaulter was not only con&s;trained to pay the &s;um required for the &s;ervice, but a fine: and in 1392 Charles VI extended the penalty to the forfeiture of the fief. The <HI>communes, communitates,</HI> or pari&s;hes and burghs, al&s;o furni&s;hed and paid their proportions. The <HI>&s;oldats,</HI> or <HI>&s;oudoyers</HI> of Froi&s;&s;art, had fixed wages; and the officers and men &s;old them&s;elves to any &s;tate engaged in war. But their di&s;orders becoming exce&s;&s;ive, Charles V terminated them, and rai&s;ed the <HI>gendarmerie,</HI> the &s;oldiery of the &s;overeign, who paid the noble leaders from the royal trea&s;ury, they providing the men. In the weak reign of Charles VI the di&s;orders re|turned; Charles VII ree&s;tabli&s;hed the <HI>gendarmerie</HI> about 1445. He maintained fifteen troops, of 100 <HI>lances</HI> each; and per|&s;uaded the burge&s;&s;es and yeomanry to defray the expence, for their own benefit and protection, for the former <HI>gendarmerie</HI> had been lodged on them: each <HI>lance</HI> had five followers; &s;o the whole number was nine thou&s;and. But there were al&s;o volunteers who &s;erved at their own expence, in the hope of &s;ucceeding on a vacancy: &s;o that the troop, or company, &s;ometimes amounted to 1200 hor&s;e. They were lodged in the towns, only twenty or twenty five being allotted to one place; and their utility was &s;oon perceived by the prevention of public ravages and di&s;orders, and the con&s;equent re&s;toration of agriculture and commerce. They were all gentlemen, led by the nobles, who were ambitious to be captains of the gen|darmerie, in&s;tead of leading their feudal force, which hence|forth was never rai&s;ed except when the <HI>Arriere Ban</HI> was
<PB N="402" REF="417">&s;ummoned. This in&s;titution maintained its purity till the reign of Francis I, when modern &s;oldiery appeared<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Daniel I, 55&mdash;156. Gro&s;e, Eng.

At that time the dre&s;s of the Welch &s;oldiers was only a tunic and mantle Ib. II, 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t it be omitted that Charles VII ordered every pari&s;h to maintain one archer, who had certain immunities<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Daniel, I, 172.</NOTE>; an example worthy of the imitation of the Scoti&s;h &s;overeigns, in their anxiety to promote archery, as a band of one thou&s;and, trained and eminently &s;killed, might have afforded no mean aid in battle, and might have kindled univer&s;al emulation.</P>
<P>From the numbers of the Scoti&s;h army perhaps the only materials ari&s;e, from which the population of the country may be vaguely e&s;timated: but unhappily the variations are &s;o great that no accuracy can be expected. Bowar computes the array in 1436 at 400,000, half hor&s;e half foot, including all between the age of &s;ixteen and &s;ixty, capable of arms, ex|cepting only herds, officers and &s;ervants of prelates, and &s;ome excu&s;ed from nece&s;&s;ity or merit<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Cont. Ford. II, 502.</NOTE>. Suppo&s;ing the array a &s;ixth of the population, the incredible number of two millions, four hundred thou&s;and, would re&s;ult. Other general arrays are computed at one hundred thou&s;and; which &s;uppo&s;ing every eighth per&s;on appeared, gives the probable number of eight hundred thou&s;and. The pre&s;ent population exceeds a million and a half, and it has been gradually increa&s;ing in this century: in the middle ages the mo&s;t rational computation would be a million, yielding an array of eighty thou&s;and effective men; but &s;ometimes doubled by a di&s;orderly rabble of unarmed pea|&s;ants and boys.</P>

<P>Severe &s;tatutes were i&s;&s;ued again&s;t tho&s;e fore&s;tallers, who de|tained their corn from the market, in expectation of a &s;carcity.

<P>The main objects di&s;coverable from tho&s;e rude rimes are, that the chief exports of Scotland were fells or &s;kins, hides, and wool; that the wool was manufactured at Popering and Bell, or Baileul, towns on the &s;outhern Flemi&s;h coa&s;t, between Dunkirk and Calais; that to make fine cloth it was nece&s;&s;ary to mingle it with &s;ome Engli&s;h wool: and that the Scoti&s;h im|ports from Flanders were mercery, but more haberda&s;hery, cart-wheels, and wheel-barrows.</P>
<P>Further hints concerning commerce may be derived from the &s;tatutes. Salmon formed an important article of export; in 1487 it was ordered that each barrel &s;hould be capable of
<PB N="409" REF="424">containing fourteen gallons; and that each burgh dealing in that article &s;hould have three iron hoops, to mea&s;ure the ca&s;k, which is afterwards to be marked with a hot iron.

Many other regulations concerning merchandize have already been &s;tated, in narrating the tran&s;actions of the parliaments.

<P>A &s;tatute of 1467 con&s;iderably illu&s;trates the &s;ubject. "It is ordained that in future no &s;hip be freighted without a charter-party, containing the following agreements; namely that the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip &s;hall find a &s;ufficient &s;teer&s;man, <HI>tymmer-men,</HI> and &s;hip-men &s;it for the &s;ervice.

<P>Concerning foreign merchants an important regulation was i&s;&s;ued by James III, in his la&s;t parliament 1487. "For the common profit of the whole realm, and to excite &s;trangers of other realms to vi&s;it this, with grain and other merchandize, to &s;upport the king's &s;ubjects; it is ordained, that in future all &s;trangers be treated honourably, with all favour, at whatever port they arrive.

<P>THE few incidents of eccle&s;ia&s;tic hi&s;tory are mo&s;tly inter|woven in the preceding books. De&s;ervedly jealous of the papal power, our kings continued to guard, by repeated &s;tatutes, the liberties of the Scoti&s;h church, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure cor|re&s;ponded with tho&s;e of the Gallican. In 1471 the purcha&s;e of any benefice or office at Rome was declared trea&s;on<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Cap. 44.</NOTE>; that avaricious court contriving at this period to draw immen&s;e &s;ums from mo&s;t European kingdoms, by the &s;ale of benefices, by arbitrary taxations, indulgences, and other arts: but the expence of the bulls of confirmation was to continue a &s;evere tax on the Scoti&s;h bi&s;hops and abbots.</P>
<P>The clergy loudly exclaimed again&s;t James III, for qua&s;hing the freedom of election, and a&s;&s;uming into his own hands the nomination to vacant benefices, which he &s;ometimes &s;old to laymen. This right was to become a con&s;iderable &s;ource of influence to the crown, when no minority intervened; but it was perhaps one cau&s;e of the enmity betrayed by Mair, Boyce, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tic writers, again&s;t the royal family and prerogative. The avarice of the pope, a churchman, would have been more tolerable to them than that of their &s;overeign; and the injury of their holy monopoly was an unpardonable oftence. James I had, in his fir&s;t parliament, ordered that no clergyman &s;hould pa&s;s or &s;end an agent out of the realm, without permi&s;&s;ion; and that no benefices &s;hould be purcha&s;ed<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Cap. 13, 14.</NOTE>:
<PB N="414" REF="429">but the royal nomination &s;eems rarely to have been exerci&s;ed till the reign of James III; and the wealth of the church, which was at lea&s;t equivalent to that of all the lay-intere&s;t, became a great object of &s;tate intrigue. In 1481 "it is or|dained by the king and his three e&s;tates, concerning the pri|vilege of the crown, u&s;ed and ob&s;erved in all times pa&s;t, in the pre&s;entation to benefices during a vacancy in the &s;ees of bi&s;hops, that our &s;overeign lord, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;hall in future, during the vacation of a &s;ee, have power to pre&s;ent to benefices, till the bi&s;hop &s;hew his bulls to the king's highne&s;s and to the chapter.

<P>While even the penury of Scotland was taxed to pamper papal avarice, and luxury, the mi&s;eries of other kingdoms were extreme.

The bi&s;hoprics of France at that time amounting to one hundred and one, the abbies and conventual priories to more than three thou&s;and, the effects of papal ex|tortion were very exten&s;ive; and it is ordered that no legate be be in future admitted to pillage the kingdom<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Jaligny hi&s;t. de Charles VIII, Paris 1684, folio, p. 399&mdash;409.

<P><PB N="415" REF="430">It is not a little remarkable that the papal dominions them|&s;elves, at a time when all the wealth of Europe was pouring into them, were almo&s;t a de&s;ert; a &s;triking in&s;tance of the ab&s;urd and heterogeneous nature of eccle&s;ia&s;tic power in tem|poral affairs.

<P>Eccle&s;ia&s;tic cen&s;ures, and excommunication, beginning to be de&s;pi&s;ed in the reign of James II, they were enforced by &s;ecular penalties<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">1443, c. 7. 1449, c. 11.</NOTE>.

<P>The eloquence of the pulpit remained in a low condition. Some judgment of it may be formed from the latin oration of Whitlaw to Richard III, in which he quotes Virgil, Statius, Cicero, and Seneca; and among other arguments for peace &s;ays, "Chri&s;t was born in peace, was buried in peace, &s;leeped in peace, and re&s;ted in peace." Yet in England at that period Dr. Shaw, and Friar Pinke, were celebrated preachers at St. Paul's cro&s;s, in the popular idiom to a popular audience; and perhaps in&s;tituted the execrable example of political &s;ermons, by promoting the &s;anguinary u&s;urpation of Richard. In de|lineating the character of bi&s;hop Kennedy, Lind&s;ay &s;ays "he cau&s;ed all par&s;ons and vicars, to remain at their pari&s;h churches,
<PB N="416" REF="431">for in&s;truction and edifying of their flocks, and cau&s;ed them to preach the word of God unto the people, and to vi&s;it them when they were &s;ick. And al&s;o the &s;aid bi&s;hop vi&s;ited every church within his dioce&s;e, four times in the year, and preached to the pari&s;hioners the word of God truly; and enquired of them if they were duly in&s;tructed in the word of God, by their par&s;on and vicar, and if their &s;acraments were duly admi|ni&s;tered, and if the poor were &s;u&s;tained, and the youth edu|cated and taught, conformably to the order that was taken in the church of God. And where he found that order was not followed he made great puni&s;hment, to the effect that God's glory might &s;hine through all the country within his dioce&s;e; giving good example to all future archbi&s;hops, and churchmen in general, to cau&s;e the patrimony of the church of God be u&s;ed for the glory of God, and the common benefit of the poor<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">P. 110, edit. 1778, 8vo.

<P>The remainder of the character of this venerable prelate may well intere&s;t the reader, as a picture of eccle&s;ia&s;tic worth, drawn in &s;imple and plea&s;ing colours. "He was a man well learned in the civil laws, and of great experience in them; and by his genius, literature, knowledge, lengthened practice, and years, he knew the nature of Scoti&s;hmen &s;o well, that he was the mo&s;t able of all the lords of Scotland, &s;piritual or temporal, to give any wi&s;e coun&s;el, or an an&s;wer when the time occurred, before the prince or the council; and &s;pecially in the time of parliament, or when the emba&s;&s;adors of other countries came for their affairs, there was none &s;o able as he to give them an&s;wer, conformably to their petition, and the de&s;ires of their ma&s;ters. When any commotions occurred in
<PB N="417" REF="432">the realm, he &s;hewed equal wi&s;dom; for he gave coun&s;el to king James II, when he was ready to depart out of Scotland, for fear of the earl of Douglas who had gathered again&s;t him to the number of forty thou&s;and men, ready to give him battle, or el&s;e to cha&s;e him out of the realm." Lind&s;ay adds that the bi&s;hop led the king into his oratory; and after prayers produced a &s;heaf of arrows, not to be broken when joined, but ea&s;ily fractured apart: from this demon&s;tration of an E&s;o|pian apologue he &s;hewed that the power of the ari&s;tocracy mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ailed by degrees<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P>The &s;tate of the church may al&s;o be e&s;timated from the old poem before quoted<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Prie&s;ts of Peebles, <HI>ubi &s;upra,</HI> p. 16, 17.</NOTE>. One of the que&s;tions is, Why the pious bi&s;hops, and clergy, of former times, exerci&s;ed all good works, and performed miracles; while no &s;uch practi&s;e or power, ap|peared among their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors? The an&s;wer is, that anciently the bi&s;hops were cho&s;en by the people, after invocation of the Holy Gho&s;t, either from among the clergy of that chapter, or by &s;electing from tho&s;e of all the kingdom the per&s;on mo&s;t proper for that particular &s;ee: that now they are appointed by the king, and introduced by the &s;ole hand of power; &s;o that they can work no miracles, except by the &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the devil: that no man procures a benefice by merit, literature, or even birth, but &s;olely by gold, &s;imony being accounted no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: and the Holy Gho&s;t having no hand in the elec|tion, his precious gifts were in con&s;equence not imparted; while the regal in&s;piration could only confer the love of gold, a gift of no miraculous nature: and the bi&s;hops being them|&s;elves &s;horn, they practi&s;ed the &s;hearing of their flocks with
<PB N="418" REF="433">great affiduity and &s;ucce&s;s; this being the genuine meaning of the &s;ymbolic eccle&s;ia&s;tical ton&s;ure.</P>
<P>While the bi&s;hops, and many abbots, were lords as having &s;eats in parliament, the inferior clergy were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the titles of <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Sir;</HI> the former perhaps appropriated to a Ma&s;ter of Arts, the latter to one who had pa&s;&s;ed all his degrees, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable benefice.

He wrote in the year 1444<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">P. 490: in the 14th year of the age of James II, born in 1430.</NOTE>; and Scoti&s;h hi&s;tory is indebted to his labour, though his deplorable defect of judgment render his work a mere chaos of materials, mingled with eccentric digre&s;&s;ions, and excur&s;ive reading. Yet from the&s;e the &s;tate of learning in the country may be e&s;timated. He quotes upwards of one hundred authors, and among them many latin cla&s;&s;ics; but former compilations no doubt &s;upplied him with much of his erudition. The common u&s;e of paper rapidly increa&s;ed the number of ma|nu&s;cripts:
<PB N="420" REF="435">and the invention of printing was &s;till more to &s;erve the cau&s;e of &s;cience.</P>
<P>Bowar had unhappily no &s;ucce&s;&s;or till John Mair wrote in 1521: and for the affairs of the fifteenth century we are in|debted to the re&s;earches of Lind&s;ay, Ferrerius, Le&s;ley, and Buchanan, who do not indicate their &s;ources of information. Yet apparently &s;hort chronicles were written, and pre&s;erved in the mona&s;teries, till they peri&s;hed in the violence of the re|formation, or mouldered amid the neglect of literature, in the &s;ucceeding century of eccle&s;ia&s;tic di&s;pute and fanatici&s;m. In his la&s;t chapter Bowar &s;ays he de&s;i&s;ts from writing, le&s;t he might &s;eem to flatter the living actors; and he clo&s;es with the following advice. "It is properly ordered in mo&s;t countries, and as I have heard in England, that every mona&s;tery of royal foundation &s;hould have its appropriated &s;cribe, to narrate the more memorable events, that occur during each reign, in that and the neighbouring countries, according to &s;trict truth, and chronology. On the death of a king, the&s;e chroniclers proceed to the fir&s;t general council, and produce their labours; which are referred to the examination of the mo&s;t &s;agacious and &s;killful, who from the whole dige&s;t one &s;ummary chronicle. The books are then returned to the libraries of the mona&s;teries, as authentic chronicles de&s;erving of faith, le&s;t by the lap&s;e of time the memory of events &s;hould peri&s;h in the kingdom. So would I advi&s;e our king to order, le&s;t if the pre&s;ent work &s;hould be lo&s;t, which heaven forbid, the memory of popes, kings, peers, and illu&s;trious men, &s;hould al&s;o peri&s;h; with the in|citements to virtue, or the cautions again&s;t faults, which are afforded by the peru&s;al of their actions<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">P. 516, 517.</NOTE>." This advice was unhappily not followed: and our monarchs, amid their pa|tronage
<PB N="421" REF="436">of the arts, &s;eem little to have attended to the utility and glory of national hi&s;tory. The mona&s;tic cellar was better repleni&s;hed than the library; and the jolly inhabitants preferred one terre&s;trial beauty to all the nine mu&s;es. In France, as has appeared in narrating the events of 1448, there was a chronicler at St. Denis, who in&s;erted narratives upon the oaths of the relators: and indeed every hi&s;torian ought to write as if he had made a &s;olemn a&s;&s;everation, in the pre&s;ence of God and his country, that truth &s;hall be his &s;ole pur&s;uit. The judicious Forte&s;cue informs us that the chronicler of St. Albans wrote, at the end of every month, what had hap|pened in its cour&s;e: and that this work, which was called <HI>Flores Chronicarum,</HI> was of more authority than any in Eng|land<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Declaration of Sir John Forte&s;cue on certain writings &s;ent from &s;cotland, again&s;t the title of Edward IV to the Engli&s;h crown.

<P>In the other departments of &s;cience little appears. Sir Gil|bert Hay, formerly chamberlain to Charles VII of France, in 1456 tran&s;lated Bonet's Arbre des Batailles, a once popular book of arms and heraldry, into Scoti&s;h, at the reque&s;t of William Sinclair earl of Orkney and chancellor<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Mackenzie's lives Sc. writers from the MS. in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE Gothic architecture had now attained its greate&s;t perfection, in &s;ublimity, richne&s;s, and variety. About 1444 William Sinclair, the celebrated earl of Orkney, founded a collegiate church at Ro&s;lin, four miles from Edinburgh, for a provo&s;t, &s;ix prebendaries, and two &s;inging boys<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Bowar, 541, &s;ays it was building when he wrote, 1444. Crawf. Off. 34, dates the foundation 1441. And &s;ee Spotti&s;woode, Rel. Hou&s;es, p. 288. If the remaining chapel be the chief fabric, it can hardly be called a collegiate church.</NOTE>. A chapel, which remains entire, is a gem of Gothic architecture, uni|ver&s;ally known and admired.</P>
<P>James III was &s;o fond of this art that Cochran, an architect, became his chief favourite. Be&s;ides the great hall in the ca&s;tle of Stirling, he founded the royal chapel there, an in&s;titution of great magnificence for that age<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Lind&s;ay, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The dean was to be the queen's confe&s;&s;or, and to have epi&s;copal juri&s;diction: this dignity was fir&s;t annexed to the provo&s;try of Kirkheugh near St. Andrew's, another royal chapel; and afterwards to the bi&s;hopric of Galloway. There were be&s;ides a &s;ub-dean, &s;a|cri&s;tan, chanter, trea&s;urer, chancellor, arch-deacon, &s;ixteen chaplains, and &s;ix &s;inging boys, with a ma&s;ter of mu&s;ic. The endowments con&s;i&s;ted of two abbies, numerous churches, and lands. James IV was to maintain and enlarge the in&s;titution; and to procure the papal confirmation<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Spotti&s;woode, ib.</NOTE>. The architecture,
<PB N="423" REF="438">and decorations, apparently corre&s;ponded with the greatne&s;s of the revenue annexed, and with the royal favour and piety.</P>
<P>In the year 1458 bi&s;hop Kennedy founded St. Salvator's college in St. Andrew's: and erected a magnificent tomb for him&s;elf in which he was interred in 1466<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. This tomb is a favourable &s;pecimen of the &s;tate of the arts at that period. But a Turki&s;h cu&s;tom, of a plain &s;tone, with a large hole or two to collect rain-water, that the birds may find drink, breathes more of chri&s;tian humility and charity.</P>
<P>The large golden medal of James III, appended to the &s;hrine of St. John at Amiens, and minutely de&s;cribed by Du Cange, was probably the production of an Italian or Flemi&s;h arti&s;t. That &s;ome eminent foreign painter had al&s;o vi&s;ited Scotland about 1482, appears from the celebrated picture at Ken&s;ington, in the form of a folding altar piece, painted on both &s;ides, or in four compartments. The fir&s;t repre&s;ents the king kneeling; behind him is his &s;on, a youth about twelve years of age, which a&s;certains the date; and St. Andrew the patron &s;aint of Scotland. The royal crown is not arched, nor was apparently till the reign of James V, when new re|galia were ordered, but it has high fleurons of great richne&s;s; the robe is of a lilac hue furred with ermine; the ve&s;t, cloth of gold. In the &s;econd compartment the queen appears, al&s;o kneeling, in a kirtle of cloth of gold, and blue robe; her head-dre&s;s one blaze of gold and jewels: the arms depicted with exact heraldry indicate the daughter of Denmark; and behind her is a per&s;onage in plate-armour, apparently her father in the character of St. Canute, the patron of his king|dom.</P>
<P>Of the two compartments, on the rever&s;e of this grand piece, one repre&s;ents the Trinity. In the other an eccle&s;ia&s;tic
<PB N="424" REF="439">kneels; but his heraldry of three buckles and a cheveron can hardly be traced, except to the ob&s;cure family of Bonkil in the Mer&s;e<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">It may be Sir William Rogers, or &s;ome other eminent foreigner.</NOTE>. Behind is a kind of organ, with two angels, not of ideal beauty, and perhaps portraits of the king's two &s;i&s;ters, Mary lady Hamilton, and Margaret then unmarried; a con|jecture &s;upported by the uncommon ornament of a coronet on the head of one of the angels. Hardly can any kingdom in Europe boa&s;t of a more noble family picture of this early epoch: and it is in it&s;elf a convincing &s;pecimen of the atten|tion of James III to the arts<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">The &s;tyle of painting, as u&s;ual in &s;uch early pieces, is that of the miniatures in manu&s;cripts enlarged, originally the productions of monks and nuns.

<P><PB N="425" REF="440">In de&s;cribing the character of that prince, Ferrerius men|tions that he not only loved literature, and invited John Ire|land a celebrated Scoti&s;h doctor of the Sorbonne into his king|dom, and rewarded his talents with a rich benefice; but ex|tended his patronage to mu&s;ic in particular. William Roger, an excellent Engli&s;h mu&s;ician, having attended the emba&s;&s;a|dors of Edward IV into Scotland in 1474, James was delighted with his performances; and per&s;uading him to remain in his court, rai&s;ed him to knighthood. "Under the in&s;truction of this man, the mo&s;t celebrated of his profe&s;&s;ion, numerous eminent mu&s;icians aro&s;e in the court of Scotland: and, even &s;o late as 1529, many great mu&s;icians boa&s;ted that they were of his &s;chool<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">f. 391.</NOTE>."</P>

<P>In proceeding to con&s;ider the &s;tate of Manners, the military exerci&s;es attract the fir&s;t notice. To promote the practi&s;e of archery, the games of foot-ball, and the golf, continued under &s;trong prohibition. Yet the highlanders appear to have been the chief archers in the ancient Scoti&s;h armies, while the low|landers preferred the &s;pear. In de&s;cribing the army of James III, in 1488, Lind&s;ay enumerates no le&s;s than ten thou&s;and highlanders with bows, under the earls of Huntley and Athole<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The author of the Pre&s;ent State of Scotland, 1682, mentions, p. 6, bows and arrows as the chief weapons of the highlanders, even of that period.</NOTE>. Repeated &s;tatutes were ineffectual to introduce
<PB N="426" REF="441">archery in the lowlands. One of the mo&s;t preci&s;e is that of James II, in his noted parliament of 1458. "It is decreed and ordained that the di&s;plays of weapons be held by the lords and barons, &s;piritual and temporal, four times in the year: and that the foot-ball and golf be utterly cried down, and not to be u&s;ed. That the bow-marks be made, a pair of buts at every pari&s;h church, and &s;hooting be practi&s;ed.

<P>Among the great the chief exerci&s;e of arms was the &s;olemn tournament, which might almo&s;t be cla&s;&s;ed under the head of Tactics, did that &s;cience comprize the preparations for war. The&s;e grand di&s;plays of martial &s;kill were &s;eldom undertaken by any, &s;ave tho&s;e who had been &s;olemnly inve&s;ted with the order of knighthood, an in&s;titution forming a kind of fraternal &s;ociety throughout Europe, and which contributed not a little to dive&s;t war of its horrours, to abate national animo&s;ity, and to pro|mote the intercour&s;e and con&s;equent civilization of remote kingdoms.</P>
<P>Knights were generally created with great &s;olemnity by the king him&s;elf; &s;ometimes by the general, or other aged knights

<P>"When Me&s;&s;ire Jaques de Lalain &s;aw that there was no further occa&s;ion for him there, he returned, and &s;ound the good duke of Burgundy in his city of Lille, who received him favourably: but he &s;oon took leave of the duke, and &s;et our for Scotland. He was accompanied by Me&s;&s;ire Simon de La|lain his uncle, and Herv&eacute; de Meriadet, and many other worthy men; and &s;o far as I under&s;tand Me&s;&s;ire James Doug|las, brother of the earl of Douglas, and the &s;aid Me&s;&s;ire Jaques de Lalain, had formerly wi&s;hed to meet in arms, and had &s;ought each other for that purpo&s;e. At the in&s;tance of the &s;aid Me&s;&s;ire James Douglas battle was permitted by the king, be|tween him and M.

Jaques de Lalain, and Herv&eacute; de Meriadet, all to fight at once before the king of Scotland. And when the day of the conflict came, the king mo&s;t honourably received them in the li&s;ts: and though I was not my&s;elf a &s;pectator, yet I mu&s;t recount the
<PB N="429" REF="444">ceremonies, for example to future times. For three memo|rable things occur, be&s;ides the battle, which was mo&s;t fiercely di&s;puted on both &s;ides."</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t was, that when the three belonging to the court of Burgundy were all armed, and each his <HI>coat of arms</HI> on his back, ready to enter into battle, M. Jaques de Lalain &s;poke to M. Simon his uncle, and to Meriadet, and &s;aid, "Me&s;&s;ieurs and my brothers in the conflict, you know that it is my enter|prize which has led us into this kingdom, and that in con&s;e|quence the battle has been granted to M. James Douglas; and although each of us may a&s;&s;i&s;t his comrade, I beg and reque&s;t you that, whatever befall me this day, none of you attempt to &s;uccour me, for it would &s;eem that you had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, and entered into this conflict only to a&s;&s;i&s;t me; and that you did not hold or know me a man able to &s;u&s;tain the a&s;&s;ault and combat of one knight, and hence le&s;s account will be held of me and my knighthood."</P>
<P>"After this reque&s;t &s;allied from the pavilions the champi|ons in armour, furni&s;hed with axes, lances, &s;words, daggers; and they had leave either to throw or pu&s;h their lances as they cho&s;e."</P>
<P>"The two Me&s;&s;ires James Douglas and Jaques de Lalain were in the middle, to encounter each other, which they did. On the right was M. Simon de Lalain, who was to engage a Scoti&s;h &s;quire, and Meriadet was to meet a knight of high power and fame; but they found them&s;elves tran&s;ver&s;e, &s;o that the knight was oppo&s;ite to M. Simon: and then Meriadet, (who de&s;ired to a&s;&s;ail him who was appointed, without regard to the &s;trength or fame of his antagoni&s;t,) pa&s;&s;ed acro&s;s, to place him&s;elf before M. Simon, and meet his man. But the good knight coldly and firmly turned towards Meriadet, and &s;aid, "Brother let each keep him&s;elf to his opponent; and I
<PB N="430" REF="445">&s;hall do well if it plea&s;e God." So Meriadet re&s;umed his rank before his antagoni&s;t: and this is the &s;econd thing which I de&s;ired to commemorate."</P>
<P>"The champions began to advance each again&s;t the other; and becau&s;e that the three on the part of Burgundy doubted lea&s;t the place might be too confined, for &s;o many lances, they all three threw their lances behind them, (the third cau&s;e of my recital;) and &s;eized their axes, and ru&s;hed on the Scots, who came within pu&s;h of lance, but that availed them nothing. Though all fought at once, I &s;hall rehear&s;e the adventures one after the other."</P>
<P>"The two Me&s;&s;ires James, Douglas and de Lalain, met each other, and approached &s;o nigh, that of all their weapons there remained none &s;ave a dagger, which the Scoti&s;h knight held. The &s;aid M. Jaques de Lalain &s;eized him by the arm, near his hand which held the dagger, &s;o clo&s;ely, that the Scot could not avail him&s;elf of it; and he held the other arm below the arm-pit &s;o that they turned each other round the li&s;ts for a long time."</P>
<P>"M. Simon de Lalain and the Scoti&s;h knight were &s;trong champions, and neither of them &s;killed in warding blows of the axe: like two valiant knights they attacked each other of often, that in a &s;hort time they had cru&s;hed the vi&s;ors of their ba&s;inets, and their weapons and armour, with mutual blows; and the fight &s;eemed equal."</P>
<P>"On the other &s;ide was Herv&eacute; de Meriadet, whom the Scoti&s;hman attacked with the pu&s;h of lance; but Meriadet turned off the blow with the but end of his axe, &s;o that the lance fell from the Scot's hands: and Meriadet pur&s;ued him &s;o keenly that, before the Scot could undo his axe, he came within his guard, and with one blow felled him to the earth. Meriadet then left the Scot to ari&s;e, who was quick, light,
<PB N="431" REF="446">and of great &s;pirit, and aro&s;e &s;peedily, and ran to Meriadet for the &s;econd time. Meriadet, (who was one of the mo&s;t re|doubted &s;quires of his time for &s;trength, lightne&s;s, coolne&s;s and &s;kill in arms and in wre&s;tling,) received the a&s;&s;ault with great compo&s;ure, then returned it, and again &s;truck him to the ground with his axe; when the Scot again attempted to ri&s;e, but Meriadet &s;truck him on the back with his hand and knee, and made him fall flat on the &s;and. And notwith&s;tand|ing the reque&s;t which Me&s;&s;ire Jaques de Lalain had made, the &s;aid Meriadet, &s;eeing the &s;truggle of the two knights, advanced to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;aid Jaques; but the king of Scots threw down his baton, and they were parted. Now though it be again&s;t my plan, and though I write of this combat without having &s;een it, I neverthele&s;s report it truly, by the report of the Scots and of our party."</P>
<P>Such is this curious contemporary relation. Other valuable materials concerning the manners of this period, may be found in the annals of De Coucy, another Burgundian coeval hi&s;to|rian, who probably attended Mary of Gelder to Scotland in 1449, as before mentioned. On her landing, the clergy, citizens, and people of Leith, were ready to receive her; and &s;he thence proceeded on hor&s;eback, behind the lord of Vere, to Edinburgh, where about ten thou&s;and people advanced to meet her. A bi&s;hop, and the chancellor, conducted her to the mona&s;tery of the Jacobins, or Gray Friars. After the king's fir&s;t vi&s;it on thur&s;day, the counte&s;&s;es of Orkney, and March, and another, attended on her by the royal command. When &s;he had &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed her&s;elf from the fatigues of the voyage, James, on the following wedne&s;day, &s;ent to ap|point the next day for the wedding; and pre&s;ented her with two hackneys worth about thirty French crowns. On thur&s;|day, the wedding-day, the king came on hor&s;eback, and was
<PB N="432" REF="447">dre&s;&s;ed in a grey robe lined with white cloth, boots and &s;purs. The queen was clothed with a robe of violet colour, lined with ermine; in a &s;trange fa&s;hion, &s;ays De Coucy, if com|pared with tho&s;e of France; and her long hair hanging down. The coronation of the queen immediately followed the mar|riage<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. par De Coucy in the edition of Jean Chartier, Paris 1661, folio, p. 574&mdash;578.</NOTE>. From &s;ome of the preceding circum&s;tances it would rather appear that James II was au&s;tere in manners, and ex|pence; and rever&s;ed his father's magnificence, which was un|popular in a penurious country, and was imputed to an Engli&s;h education.</P>
<P>At the fe&s;tival, which followed the &s;olemnity, the fir&s;t di&s;h was the figure of a boar's head painted, and &s;tuck full of <HI>hards,</HI> or coar&s;e bits of flax, which was &s;erved up in an enormous platter, &s;urrounded with thirty two banners, bearing the arms of the king and chief nobles. The flax was then kindled, amid the joy and acclamations of the numerous and brilliant a&s;&s;embly in the hall. A &s;hip of &s;ilver, exqui&s;itely wrought, was then introduced, probably containing &s;alt and &s;pices in di&s;tinct compartments. The earl of Orkney then entered, accom|panied by four knights, preceding the fir&s;t &s;ervice: and every &s;ervice was brought by about thirty or forty per&s;ons all bearing di&s;hes. At the &s;econd table the counte&s;s of Orkney, and other ladies, &s;at with the lord of Vere. At a third was a <HI>pa|triarch,</HI> &s;ays De coucy, perhaps a papal legate, or foreign vi|&s;itant, or &s;ome Scoti&s;hman enjoying a titular dignity; three bi&s;hops, an abbot, and other churchmen; the five dignitaries drinking out of a large <HI>hanap,</HI> or bowl of wood, without &s;pil|ling any: the wine, and other liquors, being as abundant as &s;ea-water. The dinner continued about five hours, there
<PB N="433" REF="448">being neither dancing nor &s;upper. On the following days there was excellent cheer in their way, proceeds this author, which was very rude and &s;trange, when compared with that of France. In five or &s;ix days Vere &s;et out on his return; and the king made <HI>&s;ome</HI> pre&s;ents. The queen weeped at their departure, though I&s;abel de Lalain, and two or three other women, and as many men of her country, were left to &s;erve her<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the reign of James III, the author of the old poem before quoted repre&s;ents his three prie&s;ts as enjoying their collation at Peebles, con&s;i&s;ting of three roa&s;ted capons with &s;auce, and many other meats; and imputes to their de&s;ire of privacy that they had only a boy to &s;erve them. A <HI>roundel</HI> or round table, covered with a fair cloth, &s;tands before them; and neither bread nor liquor are wanting. Taverns, and dice, are repro|bated; and a merchant's cupboard of plate is e&s;timated at three thou&s;and Scoti&s;h pounds, or about &s;even thou&s;and five hundred of modern &s;terling currency<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">P. 3, 11, 10. Be&s;ides plate, <HI>mazer</HI> cups are mentioned by the Scoti&s;h poets. This &s;ub&s;tance, corre&s;ponding with the French <HI>madre,</HI> appears to be china, or earthen ware, painted like the old va&s;es ridiculou&s;ly a&s;cribed to Raphael.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The advances of luxury among the ari&s;tocracy, and clergy, may al&s;o be e&s;timated by that of concomitant crimes. The two &s;tatutes of 1450, again&s;t dome&s;tic and foreign importers of poi&s;ons, &s;hew that profligacy had made more rapid &s;trides than civilization. Another &s;ort of poi&s;on, bad wine, was in|terdicted by a &s;tatute of 1482, declaring the penalty of death to any importer, &s;eller, or compo&s;er of corrupted or mixed liquor<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">1450, c. 30, 31. 1482, c. 89.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="434" REF="449">Game and hunting were luxuries of the great. In 1458 it is ordered that none de&s;troy the ne&s;ts or eggs, or fowls them|&s;elves when moulting; nor kill hares or rabbits in the &s;ea&s;on of &s;now, on pain of indictment. A penalty of ten pounds is in 1474, impo&s;ed on &s;tealers of hounds or hawks, trained or untrained; or even taking eggs, or young hawks, out of ne&s;ts in another per&s;on's property: that for robbing the ne&s;ts of partridges or wild ducks is forty &s;hillings. The &s;laughter of does, roes, or deer, in time of &s;now, or their young under a year's growth, is puni&s;hed by indictment, and a fine of ten pounds: and the &s;tealing of deer or roes from inclo&s;ures or parks, rabbits, pigeons, or fi&s;h in ponds or ditches, is made liable to the &s;ame puni&s;hment as any other act of theft<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">1458, c. 84. 1474, c. 60, 61.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To diver&s;ify the prolixity of a life of idlene&s;s, and relieve the formalities of ceremony, were objects attempted by the maintenance of a regular fool, who however had generally &s;en&s;e enough to re&s;pect his ma&s;ter. He was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his party coloured coat, his cap with large ears and bells, and his club or bauble, ornamented with grote&s;que allu&s;ions to his profe&s;&s;ion. The min&s;trels and chori&s;ters were mu&s;icians, &s;o termed becau&s;e in the middle ages church mu&s;ic was the only branch of the art which was regularly cultivated. But Lind|&s;ay mentions that a part of the chori&s;ters of the chapel-royal at Stirling always attended James III, "to make him merry<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">P. 136.</NOTE>;" and it appears that the eccle&s;ia&s;tic mu&s;icians did not di&s;dain &s;trains of recreation. In Holland's poem the min&s;trels are &s;olely occupied in &s;inging hymns, accompanied with numerous mu&s;ical in&s;truments<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Scoti&s;h Poems, 1792, III, 177.</NOTE>. The poets, compo&s;ers of &s;ongs and romances, were generally of the clerical order: the term of
<PB N="435" REF="450">min&s;trel was afterwards applied to any mu&s;ician, but the only &s;trolling poets were the Iri&s;h or highland bards, who&s;e rude manners are depicted by Holland, and who are cla&s;&s;ed in the &s;tatutes with common vagabonds: while James III &s;o highly favoured min&s;trels, or mu&s;icians, that he permitted them to equal knights or heralds in their apparel. Holland's Iri&s;h bard &s;ings a wild &s;ong, and fabulous genealogy, in his native language: and afterwards fights with two fools, his proper equals and companions<NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 180, 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The character of RIMER, or poet, was as &s;uperior to that of min&s;trel, as the <HI>jugler</HI> was beneath it. In Holland's curi|ous production the <HI>juglour</HI> merely exhibits feats of manual magic; a view of hunting is followed by a &s;ea-fight: the king's cup is &s;uddenly changed; a grey goo&s;e becomes a gold garland, &s;and becomes &s;ilver; and the like experiments of common adepts<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Ib. 179. The vague appellations, and corrupt latinity, of the middle ages confound remote characters, as the min&s;trel and jugler, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Yet the belief in real magic, and witchcraft, was now pre|valent both in England and Scotland. The duche&s;s of Glo|ce&s;ter had been impri&s;oned as a witch<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">In 1442: and &s;ee many writs in Rymer <HI>De &s;ortilegis capiendis.</HI></NOTE>: and about thirty years after we find many witches and magicians condemned to the flames in Scotland, for con&s;piring with Mar again&s;t the king's life. This new folly was to vegetate, and flouri&s;h, for near three centuries.</P>
<P>The manners of the great may be further illu&s;trated from the Tales of the Prie&s;ts of Peebles. One que&s;tion is, why the peers have &s;o much degenerated from their ance&s;tors in vir|tue, wi&s;dom, and valour? The an&s;wer is, that the royal offi|cers of ju&s;tice dimini&s;h the privileges of the lords, by indicting
<PB N="436" REF="451">and fining their tenants for pretended crimes; &s;o that the latter are reduced to poverty, and unable to arm them&s;elves properly to attend their ma&s;ters in war, or to pay their rents in peace. The peers in con&s;equence become poor them&s;elves, and en|deavour to repleni&s;h their coffers by unworthy marriages with the opulent ba&s;tard-daughters of prie&s;ts, or heire&s;&s;es of mer|chants; or by &s;elling the right of marriage of their &s;ons to rich commoners<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Ut &s;upra, p. 12, 13.</NOTE>. But this &s;atire rather refers to the artful avarice of James III; and &s;eems to evince that a great cau&s;e of the con&s;piracy of the peers was their impoveri&s;hment, occa&s;ioned by his exactions on pretence of the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; which, as appears from the &s;tatutes them&s;elves, was never in a wor&s;e &s;tate than under his reign.</P>
<P>The Dre&s;s of this period may be&s;t be illu&s;trated from &s;everal &s;tatutes on the &s;ubject. The following is of Augu&s;t 1455<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Cap. 47.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"Concerning the habits of the Earls, Lords of Parliament, Commi&s;&s;ioners of Burghs, and Advocates, to be u&s;ed in the parliament or general council, it is ordained,</P>
<P>"That all Earls &s;hall u&s;e mantles of brown <HI>granit</HI> (or fine cloth,) open before, lined with white furr, and trimmed in front with &s;ame furring, of a hand's breadth and down to the belt; with little hoods of the &s;ame cloth, pendent on the &s;houlders.</P>
<P>"And the other Lords of Parliament &s;hall have a mantle of red, open in like manner before, lined with &s;ilk, or furred with <HI>cri&s;tie gray, griece,</HI> or <HI>purray,</HI> (&s;ome furs inferior to the er|mine worn by earls;) with a hood of the &s;ame cloth, furred as the lining.</P>
<P>"And all Commi&s;&s;ioners of Burghs each to have a pair of clokes (a cloke) of blue cloth, furred to the feet, open on the
<PB N="437" REF="452">right &s;houlder; the fur of proportional value; and a hood of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>"Whatever Earl, Lord of Parliament, or Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Burghs, &s;hall enter the parliament or general council, except dre&s;&s;ed as above, &s;hall in&s;tantly depo&s;it a fine of ten pounds to the king.</P>
<P>"In every burgh, where a parliament or general council is to be held, there &s;hall be erected at the bar three tiers of benches, each higher than the other, for the commi&s;&s;ioners of the burghs to &s;it upon; under the penalty of ten pounds to be rai&s;ed on the town where the parliament or general council &s;hall be held.</P>
<P>"All men hired as fore-&s;peakers (or advocates) &s;hall wear green habits, in the form of a &s;hort tunic, <HI>(tunikil)</HI> the &s;leeves to be open like tho&s;e of a tabard. Any advocate otherwi&s;e appearing before the parliament or general council, and &s;peak|ing for a reward, &s;hall forfeit five pounds to the king."</P>
<P>The curio&s;ity of this &s;tatute may excu&s;e a few remarks. The brown <HI>granit,</HI> worn by the earls, was perhaps a tawny fine cloth, a colour fa&s;hionable in this century, till it was &s;up|planted by a brighter tint <HI>&s;carlet;</HI> a term corre&s;ponding to <HI>gra|nit,</HI> and applied by metonymy to the finene&s;s of the cloth or to its colour. The common people, as has been already men|tioned, were allowed to wear on holidays light blue, green, or red; tartan being as yet little known or confined to the great: but the fine&s;t cloths appear to have been generally dyed tawny or &s;carlet; while purple and crim&s;on were tints almo&s;t con|fined to velvets, and &s;ilks, and appropriated to princes. May it not be inferred, from the particular order for &s;eats to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the burghs, either within or without the bar, for the expre&s;&s;ion is dubious, that they were &s;ometimes obliged to &s;tand in the pre&s;ence of the haughty clergy and ari&s;tocracy?</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="453">In 1458 this act was confirmed; with the addition that the king &s;hould order patterns of all the dre&s;&s;es to be made<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Cap. 68.</NOTE>. The &s;umptuary law of the &s;ame year has already been &s;tated in the fir&s;t &s;ection of this retro&s;pect: it permits the dignified or rich clergy to wear gowns of &s;carlet with co&s;tly furs.</P>
<P>James III in 1471 ordered that, con&s;idering the great penury of the realm, and the expence of importing &s;ilk, none &s;hould wear it in doublets, gowns, or clokes, who&s;e revenue was under one hundred pounds Scoti&s;h money in landed rent, ex|cepting knights, min&s;trels, and heralds: and that women, who&s;e hu&s;bands came not within the above de&s;criptions, &s;hould not u&s;e &s;ilk in linings, but only in making the collar and &s;leeves<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Cap. 46.</NOTE>. The dre&s;s of this prince, and his queen, has been already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The gowns and mantles were &s;ometimes indecently &s;hort at this period, as appears from a penalty impo&s;ed by an Engli&s;h &s;tatute of the twenty-&s;econd year of Edward IV. The doublet and ho&s;e were long to remain in the &s;ame form: but &s;hoes, more than &s;ix inches broad at the toes, began to &s;ucceed the other extreme of long peaks. Louis XI of France, 1461&mdash;1483, appears in tho&s;e broad &s;hoes<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">See Camden's Remains, art. Apparel: and Mont&s;aucon Mon. de la mon. Fr.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the 24th of June 1470 occurs a charter of the lands of Kilmarnoc, and others, forfeited by lord Boyd, to Margaret of Denmark, the queen, during her life, "for her robes, and to &s;upply her with the ornaments of her head-dre&s;s<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Scot&s;t. Cal.</NOTE>." Other minute particulars may be traced in the trea&s;urer's accompt for 1474, reprinted in the appendix. James Homel the king's taylor, and a favourite afterwards executed at Lauder bridge, has four elns of French black to make a long gown for the
<PB N="439" REF="454">king, which is lined with &s;u&s;tian. Ho&s;e of white cloth; &s;hirts of fine holland; chamlet gowns, lined with lamb-&s;kin; &s;ocks of white cloth; doublets and ho&s;e, lined with broad-cloth; a pair of &s;purs valued at four &s;hillings; two elns of velvet to make two tippets, and furs to line them; a long mantle of velvet; a bonnet at fifteen &s;hillings; and two hats at ten &s;hillings each; a &s;atin jacket lined with lamb-&s;kin; grey cloth for <HI>long &s;ocks;</HI> black &s;atin to cover a prayer-book; velvet for a <HI>che&s;abel</HI> to his clo&s;et, and for his <HI>brigin|tynis;</HI> knobs of gold for his &s;addle; a <HI>chymna</HI> or grate for his clo&s;et; ribbons for his doublet and &s;leeves; pillows covered with broad-cloth; drugs from Flanders; an eln of &s;carlet for his petticoat; a gown of cloth of gold, lined with &s;atin, pre|&s;ented to an Engli&s;h herald who attended the emba&s;&s;y; gloves, <HI>muchis</HI> or caps; are among the articles provided for the king.</P>
<P>For the queen are pattens and corks; livery gowns lined with grey for &s;ix ladies of her chamber on a pilgrimage to Whithern; &s;atin for her <HI>turrats;</HI> black cloth for a <HI>&s;liding</HI> gown; velvet for another gown; leathern gloves; a cloke and <HI>capite bern</HI> of black, lined with Scoti&s;h cloth; eight elns of broad cloth to cover a bathing vat, and three for a &s;heet to put around her while bathing; ho&s;e of black cloth; &s;even elns of crim&s;on &s;atin for a kirtle, and to cover bonnets <HI>of tire;</HI> a grate for her clo&s;et; <HI>band-leather</HI> for furring her gloves; five elns of <HI>cri&s;ty gray,</HI> at thirty &s;hillings the eln, to line a gown of black dama&s;k; blue velvet to cover her &s;tirrup-irons; half an eln of <HI>double tartan</HI> to line her riding collars; &s;atin for tippets and collars; &s;even pounds for more than a year's &s;hoes; &s;atin for &s;tomachers, and ermine to line them; twenty-&s;ix <HI>be&s;tes of grece</HI> to line a tippet; ten pounds thirteen &s;hillings and four pence "for a ma&s;s-book to her altar, at her command, by captain John Cat," who probably brought it from Flanders.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="455">The chief articles for the prince, then a babe of two years, are &s;hirts and caps of holland cloth; coats of brown lined with white cloth, and &s;ome of the latter for his cradle; fine broad cloth for his &s;heets, or rather blankets; white ho&s;e and petti|coats, and lawn caps; French brown cloth, and tartan with buckram-binding for his cradle; Engli&s;h ru&s;&s;et for a gown to his nur&s;e; white fu&s;tian for blankets, and broad cloth for &s;heets; a coat of &s;atin, and a gown of cloth of gold, lined with blue tartan.</P>
<P>The&s;e minute particulars will be excu&s;ed, as they contribute more to illu&s;trate the &s;tate of manners, and dre&s;s, than the mo&s;t elaborate di&s;qui&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>Art. I. Cur&s;ory View of the State of the Records of Scotland, tran&s;|mitted to John Pinkerton, E&s;q 5 July, 1796<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This paper, by a William Ander&s;on <HI>writer</HI> or attorney in Edinburgh, imperfect as it is, may give the reader &s;ome idea of the &s;ubject. Of the curious and important Chamberlain's Rolls Mr. A. ob&s;erves, "independent of their being in much di&s;order, they are covered with du&s;t, I might almo&s;t &s;ay buried in it." And after the expen&s;ive erection of that &s;plendid edifice, the new Regi&s;ter Office, the following remark may &s;urprize. "It is a great pity that &s;uch a valuable Collection of Records &s;hould, in a manner, be rendered entirely u&s;ele&s;s to the public, by the expence attending the in|&s;pection of them, by the &s;tate in which they are kept, and by the want of a &s;mall fund, to recompen&s;e the per&s;on who would undertake to examine them with attention." The expence indeed is enormous, to judge from this attorney's bill, which exceeded Twelve Pounds, (not Scoti&s;h money but &s;terling,) for a trifling labour, which in England would have been held richly recompen&s;ed by three or four guineas.
<P>As the importance of national records is extreme, there ought to be in every country a literary in&s;pector of the records, independent of the juridical arrangement, to attend to the pre&s;ervation of the more ancient, and publi&s;h curious extracts.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>In obedience to M^r. Pinkerton's Letter of the 26^th ult^o. I have con|&s;umed the principal part of &s;everal days in going over what Notes I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, in making enquiries at the different offices, and in examining the &s;tate of our various Records; and now tran&s;mit to him in the following pages the information which I have obtained.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>RECORDS OF PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE olde&s;t volumes of the Parliamentary Record are in a &s;tate &s;o frail, from the wa&s;te of time, and want of proper care, that, unle&s;s the utmo&s;t attention is paid in turning over the folios, parts of them are apt to be lo&s;t by the operation. About five years ago, I ex|amined every leaf of the three or four fir&s;t volumes; but &s;ince that time the Keepers, by the de&s;ire of the Lord Clerk Regi&s;ter, prevent them from being handled: and M^r. William Robert&s;on is at pre&s;ent employed in making an Accurate Copy of them, that they may not be entirely lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t three Books of the Parliamentary Record are bound up in one Volume. The two fir&s;t of the&s;e Books, which contain a part of the Regiam Maje&s;tatem, and Acts of Robert III, James I, II, III, are not original, but have been copied in 1487. The Genuine Records
<PB N="508" REF="523">of the Scots Parliament commence with the 3^d Book of this Volume, in the Reign of James III, Anno 1466, and go down to the year 1474. From this period, to the di&s;&s;olution of the Scots Parliament by the Union of the Kingdoms, the Record appears to be pretty entire. There are in all thirty &s;ix Books, bound up in twenty &s;ix volumes, all written on good paper and well bound. Of the&s;e however the four|teenth Book, which mu&s;t have contained &s;ome proceedings of Parlia|ment in the minority of James VI, is mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>In the general Regi&s;ter Hou&s;e there are also pre&s;erved &s;everal bundles of <HI>Loo&s;e Parliamentary Records;</HI> for in&s;tance Commi&s;&s;ions to Parliament in la&s;t Century, and debates in Di&s;puted Elections, &amp;c. Be&s;ides the volumes above-mentioned there are &s;ome <HI>Decreets of Forfeiture</HI> in Par|liament, in Annis 1685, &amp; 1690&mdash;5.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;everal <HI>Records of the Committee of E&s;tates,</HI> during the Common-wealth and Protectorate: but for want of binding, their Condition is &s;o bad, that they cannot be properly looked into.</P>
</DIV4>

<HEAD>RECORDS OF SECRET COUNCIL.</HEAD>
<P>Of this Record there are a con&s;iderable number of volumes; &s;everal of which are depo&s;ited in the General Regi&s;ter Hou&s;e, in the cu&s;tody of Me&s;&s;^rs. Robert&s;ons&mdash;others of them are kept in the Ju&s;ticiary office by M^r. Norris. The olde&s;t, as M^r. Pinkerton ob&s;erves, commences 6th June 1545, and ends 2^d Augu&s;t 1547.

There are, as I am informed, twelve of the&s;e Rolls, &s;ome of which have only about twenty, others one hundred and twenty charters. They are all written on parchment: and the Charters they contain are granted by Robert I, David II, Robert II, and III.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Book of this Record is bound in red turkey; and contains about three hundred and twenty charters: &s;ome of them granted by David II, from the 33^d, to the 41^s^t, year of his reign, and others granted by Robert II.</P>
<P>The &s;econd volume contains charters granted by King James I; but the Record of very &s;ew of his Charters has been pre&s;erved. It al&s;o appears that the greate&s;t part of the Charters by James II, and III,
<PB N="509" REF="524">have been lo&s;t. Tho&s;e granted by James IV, on the contrary, &s;eem to be complete; for there are Regi&s;tred Charters, which have been granted in every year of his long reign, which is far from being the ca&s;e with tho&s;e of his predece&s;&s;ors. A good many al&s;o of tho&s;e granted by James V have peri&s;hed. Queen Mary's &s;eem to be tolerably entire; and from the reign of James VI downwards, it is thought the whole are extant.</P>

<P>The Privy Seal Record, in the General Regi&s;ter Hou&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts of about 116 volumes. It begins in the year 1499; and ends about the middle of la&s;t century.</P>
<P>This Record is a great repertorium of curio&s;ity; and from this &s;ource the accurate narrator of facts in hi&s;tory might reap &s;uperior ad|vantages, as almo&s;t every tran&s;action within the kingdom, worthy of the &s;malle&s;t notice, was in tho&s;e times the object of a Royal Letter. Every improvement in &s;cience, every invention tending to comfort or utility, was made the &s;ubject of a patent under the Privy Seal, &s;o that by the Inve&s;tigation of this Record the introduction of many of the arts into this kingdom, &s;uch as printing, &amp;c. might be clearly a&s;cer|tained.</P>

<HEAD>RECORDS OF SESSION.</HEAD>
<P>Prior to the in&s;titution of the College of Ju&s;tice, 1537<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1532.</NOTE> there were itinerant courts, which admini&s;tered Ju&s;tice in different parts of the kingdom. The olde&s;t Record of their decreets begins in Oct^r. 1478.&mdash; The&s;e are continued down pretty regularly, till the Court was e&s;tabli&s;hed in its pre&s;ent form. Only a few of the Acts and Decreets of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion have been lo&s;t; but it is &s;uppo&s;ed they will never merit the inve&s;tigation of an Hi&s;torian, being exceedingly voluminous, and re|lating to nothing but the adju&s;tment of private right.</P>

The fir&s;t volume commences 18 November 1524. But the rea&s;ons and arguments, and narration of facts, very &s;eldom appear in the Record, till towards the conclu&s;ion of that cen|tury.

<HEAD>Art. II. Extract from The Ca&s;e of Sir James John&s;tone of We&s;terhall, Baronet, claiming the Titles, Honours and Dignities of Marquis of Annandale, &amp;c. Pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Lords, 1794.</HEAD>
<P>Re&s;pecting the pre&s;ent State of the Public Records of Scotland.</P>
<P>Before &s;tating the Evidence concerning the Relation of Matthew, the fir&s;t of the Claimant's Line, to the Family of Annandale, it is proper to ob&s;erve, that although the Records of Scotland, in &s;o far as concerns Charters, Sa&s;ines, and Retours, are now very regularly kept; yet it was not till the year 1617 that an act pa&s;&s;ed, appointing a Public Regi&s;ter to be kept for all Sa&s;ines, Rever&s;ions, &amp;c. and declaring the &s;ame to be ineffectual again&s;t third parties, unle&s;s recorded therein, within 60 days.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to the Regi&s;ter of Retours, it was not the practice in more ancient times to lodge them in chancery, they remained in the hands of the private parties; and the fir&s;t Retour appearing in the Records of Chancery is dated 1^s^t February 1547; but there were many Retours expede after that period, which do not appear in the&s;e Records.</P>
<P>The Records of the Great Seal, in which Charters were in&s;erted, were more regularly kept, but it frequently happened that the Parties carried away their Charters, before they were entered in the Record; and though they &s;ometimes brought them back afterwards to be re|corded, yet very often they did not, and the time of bringing them back was various; &s;o that Charters are not always recorded in the Books according to their dates, but tho&s;e of a prior date are frequently in&s;erted after tho&s;e of a po&s;terior date.</P>
<P>It is material in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e to ob&s;erve, that the Book, which has been numbered IV, of the Records of Charters, ends with a Charter dated the 27^t^h June 1452, and the Book now numbered V, begins with a Charter, dated the 5^t^h Augu&s;t 1458; &s;o that a part of the Records has been lo&s;t, as there is an interval of &s;ix years, in which no Book now exi&s;ts, in which Charters are found recorded. A few are found in Book V. which though dated during that interval, are in&s;erted among
<PB N="512" REF="527">po&s;terior Charters; but only two of the&s;e are dated preceding January 1458, one dated 25^t^h October 1456, and another dated 6^t^h December that year.</P>
<P>It was only by an act 12^t^h July 1672, that a Regulation was made appointing all Charters, &amp;c. which pa&s;s the Great and Privy Seal, to be regi&s;tered in the Regi&s;ters of the&s;e Seals before the Seals be appended to them, and &s;uch Regi&s;tration to be marked thereon by the writers to the different Seals.</P>
<P>The Privy Seal Records are not pre&s;erved of an older date than 1499.</P>
<P>The Signet, properly &s;peaking, has no Record. It is the place where the Original Signatures or Warrants of Charters ought to be depo&s;ited, but none of the&s;e are to be found prior to 1607; and the&s;e Signatures often remained in the private Cu&s;tody of the Keeper of the Signet, and pa&s;&s;ing to his Repre&s;entatives, were generally lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Record of Sa&s;ines begins in 1617, in terms of the act of Par|liament before referred to.</P>
<P>The Records of Parliament are very imperfect, and many Books are wanting, particularly about the period of 1455.</P>
<P>The Records of the Privy Council, are not pre&s;erved further back than 1545, and &s;ub&s;equent to that year many intermediate Books are wanting.</P>
<P>The Record of Signatures in Exchequer begin in 1661, and although &s;ome of an older date are pre&s;erved, yet they are few in number.</P>
<P>This imperfect &s;tate of the Records, is partly to be a&s;cribed to neg|ligence; but it is al&s;o certain, that a great part of the ancient Records of Scodand, were carried to England by Oliver Cromwell; and it is &s;tated in the Report of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion to your Lord&s;hips, 27th February 1740, that when the Regi&s;ters, which had been carried to England during the u&s;urpation, were &s;ent back to Scotland by Sea after the Re&s;toration, no le&s;s than Eighty five hog&s;heads, which in a Storm were taken out of the Eagle Frigate, and put into another ve&s;&s;el, were all of them lo&s;t by the wreck of that ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to ancient Deeds in the hands of private Individuals, be&s;ides the Lo&s;s of many in the Calamities of War and Dome&s;tic Commotions, and by various other Cau&s;es which prevent the pre&s;erva|tion of Private Papers, it became le&s;s and object in Scotland to pre&s;erve old Deeds and writings after the Act of Parliament had pa&s;&s;ed in the year 1617, by which it was declared that 40 years undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, upon a Charter and Sa&s;ine, &s;hould be held as a complete right to Lands, unle&s;s in certain ca&s;es excepted.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t deficiency of the Records of Charters and Sa&s;ines and Retours, is found to be in tho&s;e prior to the year 1500.</P>
