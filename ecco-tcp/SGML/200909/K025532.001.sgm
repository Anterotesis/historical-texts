<HEAD>LETTER I. Francis Arundel to Charles Mortlake.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>London.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;cene I am now entering upon &s;trikes my &s;en&s;es with its novelty, but it does not &s;atisfy my mind. Bereft of your &s;ociety, and taken off from the pur&s;uit of tho&s;e peaceful &s;tudies, in which we were jointly engaged, I feel my&s;elf at pre&s;ent in a mo&s;t uncomfortable &s;ituation.</P>
<P>How it may be, when I am more fami|liarized to the modes and manners of the great world, I cannot pretend to &s;ay: as yet I &s;ee no cau&s;e to rejoice in the change my father has been plea&s;ed to make in the &s;y&s;|tem of my education: the alluring promi&s;es
<PB N="2" REF="3">
which dazzled him, never &s;truck me with the &s;ame force, and this e&s;tabli&s;hment, which he &s;o greedily caught at, has, from the fir&s;t moment he adopted it, invariably appeared to me in no other light than as a &s;acrifice of my happine&s;s to his ambition; for, if I know my&s;elf, I am per&s;uaded I am ill qualified for my office, and little likely to find either credit or comfort in a &s;tate of dependance.</P>
<P>I am at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s what u&s;e &s;uch &s;mall talents as I am endowed with can be of to the great per&s;onage, who&s;e fortunes I am now attached to. My &s;lender &s;tock of acquire|ments has been purely of the literary &s;ort, and having known no other training than in the fellow&s;hip of the Mu&s;es, <HI>inter Sylvas academi,</HI> I &s;hall be an awkward novice in the circle of the courtly graces.</P>
<P>It is &s;urpri&s;ing, my dear Charles, how much an academic air and addre&s;s embarra&s;s a man of &s;en&s;ibility in company of a certain &s;ort. I am not &s;ure but I &s;hall be obliged to put my&s;elf under the hands of &s;ome one of tho&s;e ad|verti&s;ing profe&s;&s;ors, who undertake for <HI>Grown Gentlemen,</HI> and commence a cour&s;e of pri|vate lectures; for I perceive there is more
<PB N="3" REF="4">
worldly re&s;pect paid to the accompli&s;hments of the dancing-ma&s;ter, than to all the learning of the &s;chools.</P>
<P>Alas! my friend, the milk of our <HI>alma mater,</HI> which you and I have fed upon, is a diet too &s;imple for the &s;trong &s;tomach of ambition; the heavy demands which bu&s;ine&s;s makes upon the human con&s;titution, and the daily drains of plea&s;ure will not be &s;upported on &s;o temperate a regimen; nor can all the demon&s;trations of Euclid help you to the &s;o|lution of one difficulty in the crooked &s;cheme of politics.</P>
<P>There are more phoenomena in nature, Charles, than your philo&s;ophy can account for: the eccentricity of a comet is not to be compared with that, in which &s;ome beings &s;eem to move in their political as well as moral orbits; and though we have a &s;y&s;tem for the natural &s;olution of the tides of the ocean, it would be more than the genius of a Newton could perform to explain the <HI>tides</HI> and turns <HI>in the affairs of men.</HI></P>
<P>The interior of a mini&s;ter's hou&s;e pre&s;ents a &s;cene for curious &s;peculation; every do|me&s;tic has an air of con&s;equence. I cannot
<PB N="4" REF="5">
bear the mock-maje&s;ty of the&s;e up&s;tarts: they &s;eem waiting to take mea&s;ure of me by the attention or neglect I may chance to expe|rience from their Lord: as yet, I have had &s;o little of his Lord&s;hip's company, though I live under his roof, that they have drawn no ab&s;o|lute conclu&s;ions for or again&s;t me: he re|ceived me in a manner I have no right to complain of, though a little more conde|&s;cen&s;ion would have plea&s;ed me better: the ladies of his family are not in town.</P>
<P>Two or three humble &s;olicitors have already found their way to my apartment, and made &s;uit to me in a &s;tile that is painful to my feelings. Each of the&s;e poor langui&s;hing ex|pectants would fain have per&s;uaded me into an opinion of my own con&s;equence, and how ea&s;y it was for me to &s;erve him with my prin|cipal: I find I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to heavy con|tributions on my patience and pity, if I per|&s;i&s;t in lending an ear to every man's long-winded detail of grievances, and yet it is as hard to refu&s;e that con&s;olation to the wretched race of expectants, as it is to convince them I have nothing better to be&s;tow. But why will men mi&s;under&s;tand their own intere&s;t &s;o
<PB N="5" REF="6">
totally as to be loquacious on &s;uch occa&s;ions? Every hour, that pa&s;&s;es over my head, puts me more and more out of conceit with the &s;itu|ation I am in.</P>
<P>Happy are you, my dear friend, and happy may you continue to be in the enjoyment of tho&s;e placid &s;cenes, where, amid&s;t the &s;ociety of nature's unperverted children, you can alternately enrich your mind with the di&s;co|very of truth, and delight your fancy with the &s;ports of fiction; contra&s;ting the &s;everity of your academical re&s;earches with all the charms of cla&s;&s;ic ta&s;te and elegance. Regular hours and temperate meals, with the &s;tated returns of your collegiate duties and healthful re|creations, compo&s;e that pure and primitive &s;y&s;tem of life, which you enjoy and I have lo&s;t: <Q>Such art the ills which from ambition &s;pring.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. The Earl to the Counte&s;s of G.</HEAD>
<P>I WONDER you could expect me to-day, when you might have recollected it was our cabinet dinner, and there was little or no chance of my getting down to you in the evening. I &s;hould however have &s;trove hard for it, but we were unluckily pledged to a committee of We&s;t India merchants, who held us by the ears till it was too late to leave town. If nothing unfore&s;een ari&s;es, I &s;hall be with you to-morrow; but take notice, I cannot &s;et out till after my levee is over, which will hold till near four o'clock.</P>
<P>Apropos to all this, I am to inform you, that young Arundel is arrived; the obligations I was under to his father, upon election &s;er|vices, engaged me in a promi&s;e to provide for his &s;on; I have therefore taken him as my private &s;ecretary, and now find my&s;elf encumbered with a raw lad from the uni|ver&s;ity,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
full of Greek and Latin, which I have no u&s;e for, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as it &s;hould &s;eem of no requi&s;ites for the place I have pro|moted him to. What &s;hall I do with him? If he had dropt from the moon he could not &s;eem more out of his element. He is mode&s;t, re&s;pectful, and &s;o &s;ilent, that I have &s;carce heard the tone of his voice. I think to bring him with me to Spring Grove, and turn him over to your Lady&s;hip to poli&s;h off the pedantic ru&s;t of his Cambridge educa|tion. The Bi&s;hop tells me he is a capital &s;cholar, and has carried off all the prizes from his competitors; you, who have a &s;trong taint of the blue-&s;tocking coterie, can be&s;t judge of that part of his character, I, who want only a ready penman and a me|thodical drudge, might have been better &s;uited with the fir&s;t plodding clerk I had picked out of my office.</P>
<P>Tell Loui&s;a I in&s;i&s;t upon her being well again&s;t the time we meet: I expect to find that fre&s;h air, cold bathing and the exer|ci&s;e of riding will have repaired the ravages that late hours, hot a&s;&s;emblies and full draw|ing-rooms had made in the bloom of youth and beauty.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>YOU know my pa&s;&s;ion for retirement, and therefore cannot wonder at the partiality I have ever had for this delightful villa. It is now in prime beauty, and as the phy&s;icians have thought it nece&s;&s;ary for Lady Loui&s;a to take the country air, my Lord has con&s;ented to di&s;pen&s;e with my &s;taying any longer in town, and I have now been a whole week <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> with the dear girl, who has advanced in her recovery every hour. So many are the oppor|tunities I have had of conver&s;ing with her, and &s;uch is the openne&s;s of her nature, that I am now &s;atisfied there was no ground for the &s;u&s;picion I had taken up of her having con|ceived
<PB N="9" REF="10">
a liking for that gay young libertine Sir George Revel. Certainly he was very parti|cular in his a&s;&s;iduities on the night he danced with her at the duche&s;s's a&s;&s;embly, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s there was &s;omething in her manner, and more particularly in her looks, which alarmed my motherly anxiety, which mu&s;t be continually awakened for the &s;afety of a young per&s;on &s;o full of attractions, and withal &s;o vo|latile as my Loui&s;a. I really think we have brought her out at too early an age, but no|thing would put my Lord by from having her pre&s;ented, though &s;he had but ju&s;t completed her &s;ixteenth year, and the con&s;equences were ea&s;ily fore&s;een. Surrounded by admirers, and followed by a crowd in every place &s;he enters, like &s;ome public &s;pectacle, who can wonder if &s;o young a head grows giddy with the flattery, that is paid her, and if her health is now &s;uf|fering by the late hours and fa&s;hionable di&s;&s;i|pations of a town life? but there is no laying any re&s;traint upon my Lord's unlimited indul|gence, and nothing is left for me but to lament in &s;ilence and obey. I mu&s;t not however for|get to acknowledge the relief I &s;ometimes have recour&s;e to, and which I am now availing my|&s;elf
<PB N="10" REF="11">
of, whil&s;t I &s;ecretly unburthen my full heart to you, and you alone; for you can feel for me; your friendly pity lightens my load, and your better judgment corrects my weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>I know your &s;entiments &s;o well upon the &s;ubject of mu&s;ic, that I am almo&s;t afraid to tell you how much her talent in that captivat|ing art is improved; I have heard you men|tion with regret the time, which young women are too apt to dedicate to that accompli&s;hment, and after all it mu&s;t be owned a dangerous ex|cellence when it is attained; for where the heart is actuated by tho&s;e tender propen&s;ities, which are too evidently inherent in Loui&s;a's nature, I mu&s;t admit that mu&s;ic is very truly, though poetically, called <HI>the food of love</HI>; and it is not &s;o much the melting cadence of her voice, as the expre&s;&s;ive language of her eyes, which makes me tremble for her during tho&s;e performances, which her father's vanity is for ever calling for. She is really &s;o captivating, and &s;o &s;en&s;itive towards the admiration of tho&s;e &s;he captivates, that if I had any voice in the matter, &s;he &s;hould not be &s;uffered to di&s;play her attractions &s;o promi&s;cuou&s;ly as &s;he does; nor would I indulge her predilection for tho&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="12">
&s;oft and tender cantabiles, which &s;he generally &s;elects for her performances.</P>
<P>I know you think with me on this &s;ubject, and I al&s;o know how well appri&s;ed you are of my Lord's way of thinking, and the fruitle&s;s attempt it would be for me to oppo&s;e it. In this as in all things el&s;e I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to his will and plea&s;ure:&mdash;but whil&s;t I am writing this his equipage is in &s;ight, and I mu&s;t in&s;tantly break off and ha&s;ten to receive him.&mdash;To-morrow I will re&s;ume the plea&s;ure I have now &s;u&s;pended.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>My Lord came down to us ye&s;terday in &s;uch good &s;pirits, that I am apt to think affairs of &s;tate have taken &s;ome turn more fortunate for his admini&s;tration, than has been u&s;ual of late; but this I can only gue&s;s at, as I never know or wi&s;h to know any thing of politics and parties. No body accompanied him but a young gen|tleman whom he has ju&s;t taken into his family as his private &s;ecretary; he is the only &s;on of Dr. Arundel, a re&s;pectable clergyman in our county, and one who&s;e intere&s;t and &s;upport were of the greate&s;t &s;ervice to my Lord at the la&s;t general election: his father educated him
<PB N="12" REF="13">
for the church; my Lord &s;ays he has brought an excellent character from Cambridge, and indeed if I may judge upon &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance he &s;eems well to de&s;erve it. By my Lord's man|ner of de&s;cribing him, in a letter he wrote to me the day before ye&s;terday, as a raw lad from the univer&s;ity, I had formed my&s;elf to expect &s;omething very awkward and uncouth in his appearance; but nothing can be further from it; for though he has none of that happy a&s;&s;urance, which puts our young men of fa&s;hion &s;o entirely at their ea&s;e in all compa|nies, he has a natural good-breeding which plea&s;es me much better; and his attentions, without &s;inking into &s;ervility, are of that re|&s;pectful yet manly ca&s;t, which &s;eem to indicate a proper under&s;tanding of him&s;elf as well as others. My Lord told me in a whi&s;per, that he had been greatly plea&s;ed with his conver&s;ation by the way, and that the prejudice of his fir&s;t appearance had been entirely removed: I think, added he, I &s;hall make &s;omething of him in time; but I perceive at pre&s;ent he is too high-minded; for upon my informing him, that I &s;hould appoint him a proper &s;tipend from my private pur&s;e, till I could otherwi&s;e provide
<PB N="13" REF="14">
for him, my young gentleman truly would not hear of it, and conte&s;ted the point with me in a &s;tile that I &s;hould never have expected a depen|dant to make u&s;e of: I confe&s;s to you I was highly di&s;plea&s;ed with him at fir&s;t, but in the end I pa&s;&s;ed it over and made allowances for his extreme ignorance of the world, imputing it to the pride of mind and &s;elf-con&s;equence which the&s;e young academics are apt to con|tract at the univer&s;ity.&mdash;To this I &s;eemed to acquie&s;ce, by ob&s;erving that experience would make him wi&s;er; but I confe&s;s to you I drew very different conclu&s;ions in my own mind, and much more in Mr. Arundel's favor, than I ventured to expre&s;s, for it is not my way to oppo&s;e my Lord in any of his opinions.</P>
<P>After coffee was over nothing would con|tent my Lord but that Loui&s;a mu&s;t &s;it down to her piano forte, and though the phy&s;icians had forbidden her to &s;ing, an air was called for and the favorite &s;ong in Per&s;eo was &s;elected for her performance, though it concludes with a braveura that demands more than ordinary exertion: Mr. Arundel was &s;oon after pre&s;&s;ed to take up his violin and accompany Loui&s;a in a concerto; this he would fain have declined,
<PB N="14" REF="15">
and &s;poke &s;o mode&s;tly of his talent, that my Lord &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to let him off, ob&s;erving to me in a whi&s;per, that he concluded it was not worth the hearing. Loui&s;a in the mean|time had turned over her books, and picked out a concerto, which &s;he told him was a favorite of her father's, and that he mu&s;t ab&s;o|lutely do his be&s;t to bear a part, for which pur|po&s;e &s;he would take it in &s;lower time to ac|commodate him. This command he obeyed without further he&s;itation, and to our great &s;urpri&s;e executed it in &s;o ma&s;terly a &s;tile, with &s;uch excellence of ta&s;te, tone and execution, as threw my Lord into ab&s;olute raptures, who quite oppre&s;&s;ed poor Arundel's mode&s;ty with his applau&s;es. It was now in vain to think of &s;temming the torrent, for the harmonious rage had &s;eized Loui&s;a as much as it had her father, and our young mu&s;ician &s;orely again&s;t his will was made to accompany her in two of her be&s;t &s;ongs, which I mu&s;t own he did with &s;o much delicacy of expre&s;&s;ion, as to make even me for the time almo&s;t as imprudent as my Lord; but at the conclu&s;ion of the &s;econd air, having &s;napt one of his &s;trings, as I verily believe by de&s;ign, he had not, or pretended that he had not,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
another; and &s;o concluded our concert, to the great mortification of my Lord, and the fortu|nate re&s;cue of Loui&s;a's exhau&s;ted &s;pirits.</P>
<P>This morning my Lord went early to town, having left his young man with us till his re|turn; and being Sunday and Loui&s;a's health making it not advi&s;eable for her to venture to church, we de&s;ired Mr. Arundel to read the &s;ervice to us at home, which he did in &s;uch a manner, as impre&s;&s;ed me with regret, that talents, &s;o adapted to the office he was per|forming, &s;hould be diverted to le&s;s worthy purpo&s;es; and, thinking as I do of politics and all who are involved in them, I pitied the fate of this unhappy victim to dependance, and from my heart abhorred the mercenary motives of the father, who had withdrawn him from the &s;ervice of God and &s;acrificed him to the mammon of ambition.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SON FRANCIS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS it hath now plea&s;ed the Giver of all good things to crown my humble endeavours with &s;ucce&s;s, and to permit me to exalt you to a &s;phere, where your talents may have room for their di&s;play, and your fortune, un|der prudent care and caution, may be finally e&s;tabli&s;hed to the extent of my mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes, through the favor of my gracious patron and benefactor, the noble Earl of G. it behoves me to give you &s;uch rules for your conduct as may lead your inexperienced youth in the right road to preferment; and it will be your indi&s;pen&s;able duty to ob&s;erve and fol|low the&s;e directions faithfully and implicitly at all times and on all occa&s;ions, as I &s;hall find needful for your government and guidance in the cour&s;e of life, which you have now com|menced.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">Recollect, child, that I have now lived, (ble&s;&s;ed be God!) to &s;ee many days; and, ac|cording to the computation of man's brief pilgrimage, may already account my&s;elf a man full of years. Old age and experience are the parents of wi&s;dom, and I tru&s;t it is no vanity in me to pre&s;ume I am entitled to &s;ome atten|tion on that account, having now for more than thirty years, without intermi&s;&s;ion, &s;uper|intended the &s;piritual welfare of this populous pari&s;h, and lived in fair repute, not only with my own peculiar flock, but let me add, with all my neighbours round about. I mu&s;t there|fore know &s;omething of life, and I ought to know it, for in this period I have looked it through and through&mdash;I have &s;tudied not only books, but men and things, and compo&s;ed many differences and difficulties among&s;t my contentious brethren, hard and intricate in their nature, whereby I have done benefit to my fellow-creatures, and acquired the repu|tation of much wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion to my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Let me tell you therefore in the fir&s;t place, that you ought on no account to have taken on your&s;elf to reply as you did to your noble
<PB N="18" REF="19">
patron, touching the allowance, which he ge|nerou&s;ly offered to you from his private pur&s;e, till &s;uch time as he could better provide for you. Why did you not apply to me for my advice in that particular? I &s;hould have given you far different and better coun&s;el: know you not, ra&s;h young man, that it is both your intere&s;t and your duty to refu&s;e nothing? Can you not comprehend, impolitic and improvi|dent as you are, that if his noble Lord&s;hip had paid you from his own pocket, it mu&s;t in rea&s;on and the nature of things have quick|ened his &s;peed to exonerate him&s;elf from the incumbrance of your &s;tipend? And what is the re&s;ult of this? what, but a place in &s;ome branch of the revenue, or perhaps the portion of a place, equivalent at lea&s;t, if not &s;uperior, in value to the amount of your private pay? Ah, fooli&s;h boy! well may I exclaim with the poet, <HI>Quale dedi&s;ti principium adveniens!</HI>&mdash;But go back to his Lord&s;hip and humble your&s;elf in his pre&s;ence; peradventure he will treat it as a fir&s;t offence and receive you to his for|givene&s;s, in pity of your inexperienced youth and weakne&s;s. Tell him that I accept this generous tender with heartfelt gratitude and
<PB N="19" REF="20">
devotion; and when you have got it, look well to the di&s;po&s;al of it, &s;o as I may not be called upon to &s;upply your exceedings, but manage your affairs with that oeconomy, which will be your be&s;t friend through life.</P>
<P>I am told his Lord&s;hip's patronage is pro|digious: inform your&s;elf well of all particu|lars, and be careful to minute down all offices and appointments within his gift, in a private book of your own, according to their real va|lue and perqui&s;ites, with proper comments upon the per&s;ons of the re&s;pective incumbents, viz. as to age, health, infirmities, connections, &amp;c. This will be to thee the very manual of wi&s;dom, and this I am well a&s;&s;ured is the u&s;ual practice with dependants in your &s;ituation, who have any fore&s;ight and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Be always ready at the call, nay at the very nod of your principal; &s;tudy his looks, &s;o as to anticipate, if po&s;&s;ible, his wi&s;hes, before he can give them utterance. Make friends with all that are of his family or connections; none are to be neglected by you, not even his do|me&s;tics, for they have much to &s;ay, and many opportunities to &s;ay it in.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip, you well know, is of a lofty
<PB N="20" REF="21">
nature, high in blood, rich in honors, and re|plete with power, authority and wealth: his humour therefore mu&s;t be your law, and in all things you mu&s;t accord to it; if you thwart it, you are undone; if you &s;ooth it, your for|tune is made.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s is a mo&s;t virtuous and amia|ble lady, re&s;pectable for her private and dome&s;|tic qualities, but &s;he has little influence over his noble mind, and being altogether detached from great affairs, can be of little &s;ervice to your views, and you will do wi&s;ely to propor|tion your attention to her accordingly.</P>
<P>It is not &s;o with the young and beauteous lady Loui&s;a, for &s;he, as I can witne&s;s, is her father's darling, and has much to &s;ay. Let your devoirs to this lovely favorite be dedi|cated with the mo&s;t profound devotion; herein you will be furthered by your &s;kill and addre&s;s in mu&s;ic, to which it &s;eems both &s;he and your noble patron al&s;o are much devoted.</P>
<P>Let the&s;e few maxims &s;uffice for the pre|&s;ent; they are however, though few in num|ber, well worthy your attention for their im|portance. Weigh them thoroughly in your thoughts, write them on the tablet of your

<P>Our new acquaintance has been very agree|able to us, and really helped us to pa&s;s our time much plea&s;anter than we could otherwi&s;e have di&s;po&s;ed of it. How much did I wi&s;h
<PB N="22" REF="23">
for you to have been of our party! for he is ab&s;olutely the very be&s;t reader I ever li&s;tened to: if I may judge by the &s;ubjects he &s;elected for our hearing, he had &s;omething more in view than merely to entertain us, for nothing could be better cho&s;en; and where any explana|tion was wanting, he &s;upplied it in a manner, that made us oftentimes more indebted to the commentator than the author. It is matter of a&s;toni&s;hment to me how &s;o young a man can have &s;tored his mind with &s;uch a fund of learning, and of &s;o many various &s;orts, for he &s;eems ma&s;ter of all &s;ubjects that are thrown in his way: but the&s;e are matters out of my depth; you would be fully competent to pronounce upon his merit, and to you I mu&s;t refer it.</P>
<P>We have had no mu&s;ic, for he would never put his violin in order, and I have now di&s;co|vered that it was as I &s;u&s;pected, nothing but a contrivance to give re&s;pite to Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>This morning I took a long walk with him round our ornamented farm, whil&s;t Loui&s;a was employed in writing to Lady Jane; from the turn of his conver&s;ation I could plainly enough di&s;cover, that he is not overjoyed by the &s;itua|tion he is thrown into, which &s;eems to have
<PB N="23" REF="24">
been entirely of his father's &s;eeking, and by no means the way of life, which he would have made choice of for him&s;elf. This I own af|fected me very &s;en&s;ibly, and I could not for|bear giving him &s;ome hints, which I conceived might be u&s;eful to him in his future views and connections. He li&s;tened to me very atten|tively, and after a &s;hort &s;ilence addre&s;t him&s;elf to me in the following words:&mdash;</P>
<P>I am much beholden to your Lady&s;hip for the kind advice you have given me, which I &s;hall not fail to bear in mind; but I am afraid Lord G. will &s;oon repent of the choice he has made, for by what you have been plea&s;ed to hint to me, I perceive there are many more arts and managements nece&s;&s;ary in a &s;ituation of dependance than I am ever likely to learn, or having learnt to carry into practice. I have that opinion of his Lord&s;hip's delicacy, that I dare &s;ay he will never require of me any other &s;acrifices, than the &s;pirit of a gentleman ought in rea&s;on to &s;ubmit to; but I am not &s;o &s;ure of other people, who may regard even &s;uch an in&s;ignificant being as I am with an eye of jea|lou&s;y; and I am &s;en&s;ible I never &s;hall be po&s;&s;e&s;t of that convenient patience, which can put up
<PB N="24" REF="25">
with an in&s;ult, though it were no otherwi&s;e to be re&s;ented than by the total &s;acrifice of my intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Believe me, Mr. Arundel, I replied, howe|ver commendable the&s;e principles are, yet, as the world is now fa&s;hioned, too quick a &s;en&s;i|bility will involve you in a thou&s;and troubles, and I do &s;incerely wi&s;h for your &s;ake I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e powers of per&s;ua&s;ion, which might prevail with you to be upon your guard, more e&s;pecially at your out&s;et into life. But I have no &s;uch powers, and can only offer you my good wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, turning quickly towards me, his countenance animated with the mo&s;t lively blu&s;h, I mu&s;t be a mon&s;ter, exclaimed he, if I could ever lo&s;e the memory of this goodne&s;s, or prove in&s;en&s;ible to the honour you confer upon me; and I mu&s;t beg your Lady&s;hip to be a&s;&s;ured that there is no opinion can proceed from your lips, which I &s;hall not mo&s;t implicitly adhere to, that only excepted, which has reference to your&s;elf; therein you mu&s;t permit me very widely to di&s;&s;ent; and if it were not too pre&s;umptuous a reque&s;t to make, I &s;hould account my&s;elf mo&s;t happy
<PB N="25" REF="26">
and mo&s;t honoured, would you &s;uffer me, in ca&s;e of future difficulty, (provided the affair be not unfit for &s;uch a reference) to throw my&s;elf upon your friendly judgment for ad|vice: I blu&s;h to make &s;o bold a &s;uit, but in|deed I am incapable of abu&s;ing your conde|&s;cen&s;ion, and I flatter my&s;elf, if I was allowed to think of you as of one, to whom I was to bring my conduct to account, I &s;hould never have the heart to do a deed, or even meditate a thought, that might di&s;honour my pro|tectre&s;s.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the eager manner of his utter|ance and the unexpected claim he made upon my confidence, (which to own the truth was &s;omewhat more &s;udden than our acquaintance warranted, and rather out of form in the manner it was introduced) threw me into &s;ome confu|&s;ion, and I rather doubt if you will think that I deported my&s;elf altogether as I ought by a&s;&s;ent|ing to a reque&s;t, which may po&s;&s;ibly engage me further as a party in his fortune and affairs than in prudence I &s;hould have gone; and indeed, con&s;idering how little influence I have over any per&s;on or in any thing, was it not in fact a kind of deceit to let him think that &s;uch a
<PB N="26" REF="27">
friend could be of any u&s;e to him in life? If there had been the lea&s;t degree of forwardne&s;s, the &s;malle&s;t &s;hadow of impertinence either in his look or deportment, I could have drawn up, and, however foreign it may be to my na|ture to a&s;&s;ume the great lady, I &s;hould in that ca&s;e perhaps have taken it upon me to put him at his di&s;tance; but in this in&s;tance it would have been rank pride and ill-nature to have turned a di&s;couraging countenance upon a mo|de&s;t youth, who&s;e emotions were &s;imply tho&s;e of gratitude and re&s;pect, and I &s;hould have abhorred my&s;elf had I been capable of attempt|ing it.</P>
<P>Thus for the fir&s;t time in my life has your friend been drawn out of that negative in&s;ig|nificance of character, which I have &s;o long &s;tudied to pre&s;erve, and &s;urpri&s;ed into an un|dertaking, which I am as unfit for as my pupil is for a dependant. You will &s;mile to think of me in the character of a female Mentor, me, who have no voice in any body's affairs, and hardly dare to advi&s;e even my own child: as for his connection with my Lord, I mu&s;t look upon that as in a very precarious light, for, unle&s;s his violin pleads &s;trongly in his favor,
<PB N="27" REF="28">
I know no other chance he has to find the way to his good graces. He will not flatter, and he is too proud to truckle to the hangers-on, that &s;warm about the Great: the fir&s;t &s;crape he falls into on that account will completely open his eyes as to my want of con&s;equence, and &s;hew him that he leans upon a broken reed, for there I can afford him no help: the only u&s;e I could be of to him is in difficulties, which may ari&s;e from my own &s;ex, for I &s;hould tell you that this young Secretary of our's is out of all compari&s;on the hand&s;ome&s;t young man I have ever &s;een, and very finely formed withal; &s;o that I conclude he will have embar|ra&s;&s;ments more than enough to &s;truggle with from that quarter; but it &s;o happens that upon the only points I could &s;erve him in, delicacy mu&s;t of cour&s;e prevent him from employing me.</P>
<P>Poor Arundel! does not your kind heart feel a pity for him? mine does, and your's will no le&s;s than mine, when you &s;ee him and know him.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI. Francis to Dr. Arundel.</HEAD>
<P>I AM truly concerned to find you di&s;approve of my declining Lord G.'s offer; if any con|&s;ideration could prevail with me to accept it, your commands would; but if I have hitherto obeyed you in all things, I hope you will par|don this my fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, as I cannot do &s;o great a violence to my nature, as to take wages from the hand of a ma&s;ter, and &s;ink my&s;elf to the condition of a hired &s;ervant.</P>
<P>As to the idea of its operating as a quickener to provoke him to a more &s;peedy provi&s;ion for me by other means, I confe&s;s it never en|tered my thoughts, nor do I think I &s;hall ever acquire &s;o politic an attention to my own in|tere&s;t, or that any experience will improve me in a &s;pecies of wi&s;dom, which centers &s;o ex|clu&s;ively and individually in my&s;elf.</P>
<P>If the burthen that may eventually fall upon you, till &s;ome provi&s;ion &s;hall be found for me, is among&s;t the motives, that induce you to
<PB N="29" REF="30">
enjoin my compliance with the offer in que&s;|tion, I think my&s;elf fortunate in being able to &s;ecure you again&s;t tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions for &s;ome time to come by the very kind and &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply which my uncle's bounty has ju&s;t &s;ent me, amounting to the &s;um of two hundred pounds; and I &s;latter my&s;elf at the &s;ame time the manner in which I &s;hall hu&s;band this fund, will impre&s;s you with no unfavorable opinion of my oeconomy.</P>
<P>The le&s;&s;ons of humility, which you are plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon me, I &s;hall &s;trive to profit by; I am al&s;o &s;en&s;ible how much my ignorance &s;tands in need of admonition, and how well qualified you are to admoni&s;h; but I &s;hall hope to find Lord G. too noble to demand tho&s;e abject a&s;&s;iduities, which would degrade my character and reflect no honour upon his. If I can re&s;pect him for his virtue, talents and integrity, my devotion will go as far as any man's ought to go; but if I find him wanting in the&s;e qualities, I can never pay adoration to rank alone, nor flatter power with the &s;ordid view of profiting by what I de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>On all occa&s;ions I &s;hall proportion my re&s;pect according to the merit rather than
<PB N="30" REF="31">
importance of the per&s;ons I may be concerned with; and by this rule, as far as I have yet been able to di&s;cover, Lady G.'s claim will by no means be &s;o &s;light and in&s;igni|ficant, as you &s;eem to think it. I embrace with a devoted heart the tender of your fa|therly friend&s;hip and affection on the con|dition of my de&s;erving it, which I &s;hall &s;tudy to fulfil by approving my&s;elf at all times and on all occa&s;ions,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. Arundel to Captain John Arundel.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE received your order for two hun|dred pounds at your agent's office, and mo&s;t gratefully acknowledge your genero&s;ity to me on this and all occa&s;ions. I would &s;ay much more to you on the &s;ubject if I dare, but as I know you too well to venture upon profe&s;&s;ions, I &s;hall only a&s;&s;ure you that though you have made me rich, you have made me frugal, as I &s;hall &s;corn to di&s;&s;ipate the earnings of your va|lour in an unbecoming manner.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own your favor reached me in a needful moment, for as I had di&s;obliged my father by refu&s;ing a &s;tipend from Lord G. he had puni&s;hed my pride by revenging him|&s;elf upon my pocket; and I find enough to di&s;like in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation without the aggravation of poverty.</P>
<P>Alas! my dear uncle, there is &s;omething in my blood, that revolts again&s;t dependance: my ance&s;tors never yet &s;erved any ma&s;ter but

<P>If my wi&s;hes could have prevailed I had continued at Cambridge, where I was pur&s;uing my &s;tudies with &s;ome little reputation; but if that was not to be allowed of, why was I not thrown into the army, where my uncle the Ge|neral would have protected me, and has been &s;o earne&s;t to place me? but you well know his offers were rejected in a manner &s;o di&s;obliging, as to occa&s;ion &s;uch a breach between my father and the head of our family, that I am peremptorily interdicted from paying the common civilities of a vi&s;it to Sir Francis, who lives within a few doors of Lord G.'s hou&s;e in town, and who I dare believe would be too noble to let me feel any part of the re&s;entment he has con|ceived again&s;t my father.</P>
<P>As for you, my dear uncle, it is now ten years ago &s;ince you propo&s;ed to enter me on your books and educate me under your
<PB N="34" REF="35">
own eye in the &s;ervice, which above all others I &s;hould have preferred and delighted in; but you al&s;o met a rebuff, and the full half of my life has been &s;pent in regretting a di&s;ap|pointment which it is now too late to redeem, whil&s;t I have the cutting mortification to &s;ee the whole world in arms again&s;t my country, and I remain an idle &s;pectator of the glorious conte&s;t.</P>
<P>What would I not have given to have &s;tood by your &s;ide in your late gallant engagement! my heart burnt within me when I read of your beating off a &s;hip of &s;o &s;uperior a force that &s;he ought to have blown you out of the water, had not your re&s;olution and addre&s;s balanced the di&s;proportion of her &s;trength.

<HEAD>LETTER IX. Charles Mortlake to Arundel.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Trin. Coll. Cam.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Find &s;ince you, my dear Frank, have left us, I am an altered character, and no longer worthy any man's acquaintance: I am grown in&s;ufferably &s;elfi&s;h and un&s;ocial. Is it becau&s;e I had no plea&s;antry, no merit, but what I caught from you? Could not you be content|ed with engro&s;&s;ing every public honor, but mu&s;t you &s;trip your friends of their little private mo|dicum of prai&s;e, and cram their &s;craps into your wallet? I am di&s;covered to be a very dull fellow, and every body flies me accordingly. Perhaps I am a little unrea&s;onable in expect|ing all the world to love you as well as I do, and have wearied out their patience with la|mentations for the lo&s;s of you.</P>
<P>And is the lo&s;s only mine? Is it not your's al&s;o? Alas, alas! I was in hopes I &s;hould have had nothing but the evil pa&s;&s;ion of envy to get over, a little &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s or &s;o to conquer,
<PB N="36" REF="37">
which I did not ab&s;olutely de&s;pair of effecting in due time; but if I am to be attacked by the generous impul&s;e of friend&s;hip; if by the &s;hifting of your fortune from happy to unhap|py, my heart is to endure a like tran&s;ition from &s;elfi&s;h to &s;ympathetic feelings, it is more than I can encounter: I can never be reconciled to my own lo&s;s, unle&s;s I could reflect that it was to be your gain.</P>
<P>Have you taken a fair mea&s;ure of your lot in life? have you con&s;idered it in its po&s;itive, in its relative light? You are a great adept in theory, are you any thing of a philo&s;opher in practice? I much doubt it. Are you quite &s;ure that dependance is &s;uch a bugbear? Is not every man in &s;ome points, &s;ome periods of his time, a dependant? Do we not &s;erve a tem|porary apprentice&s;hip to every art, &s;cience and profe&s;&s;ion in life? Cannot you &s;ubmit to go to &s;chool above once before you are made a man of? What have I to look to, that am an cleve of the church? mu&s;t not I expect to work my way through the probationary drudgery of a curacy, before I can expect to lie down in the &s;oft lap of beneficed indolence? and what are you gentlemen politicians more than the
<PB N="37" REF="38">
re&s;t of mankind, that you alone &s;hould be exempted from going through your degrees, and &s;tart up at once doctors and profe&s;&s;ors of the untaught my&s;teries of government? Happy in&s;piration, if it were &s;o! mi&s;erable people, to be governed by up&s;tarts and empirics, if it be not &s;o!</P>
<P>For my part I believe every man's temper is mended by dependance, as vice is oftentimes corrected by &s;ickne&s;s. You perhaps will di&s;|pute the point with me, and contend that he learns to be mean in&s;tead of humble, to be cunning when he ought to be wi&s;e: I cannot be an&s;werable for his mi&s;takes; I cannot help a &s;illy fellow's running into bye-ways and crooked allies, when the open &s;treet lies &s;trait before his no&s;e.</P>
<P>You may remember I was a &s;tiff anti-mini&s;|teriali&s;t before you commenced &s;tate&s;man; I have now turned my coat out of compliment to you, but it is a compliment that puts no great force upon my con&s;cience, for as I could never rea&s;on on either &s;ide the que&s;tion from total ignorance of both, I have only transferred my wi&s;hes from one party to the other, with|out knowing where the preference lies; and if
<PB N="38" REF="39">
you have no better advocates than me, your cau&s;e will be but lamely defended. Heaven keep our blue gowns and &s;quare caps from the contagion of politics!</P>
<P>I am lately become exceedingly fond of our phy&s;ic garden, and have commenced a cour&s;e of botanical lectures: thus perhaps, whil&s;t you are plucking up the weeds that overrun the political region, I &s;hall be employed upon the &s;ame ta&s;k in the natural one, and &s;o by our joint labours <HI>the world's unweeded garden</HI> in time be culled, and the baneful poi&s;ons, which it now abounds in, made medicinal, and con|verted into antidotes.</P>
<P>Our mu&s;ical parties langui&s;h mi&s;erably for want of their leader; and whil&s;t our harmonic body is &s;tarved by your ab&s;ence, London, which has &s;pirited you from us, is &s;urfeited with repletion; &s;o unequally are the good things of life di&s;tributed.</P>
<P>I have been up &s;ince day-break, and the chapel bell now &s;ets in, a &s;ummons, which you never failed to obey; how happy I once thought my&s;elf; that I was quartered &s;o near you! I now pa&s;s year windows with a &s;igh, take a pen&s;ive turn or two in the cloi&s;ters, and

<HEAD>LETTER X. Arundel to Charles Mortlake.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>I Write to you from Spring Grove, the charming villa of Lord G. about twelve miles from town.</P>
<P>I accompanied his Lord&s;hip on Saturday la&s;t, who left me here with the ladies for the be&s;t rea&s;on in the world, becau&s;e he did not know what to do with me him&s;elf, and they did; for their good-nature found a thou&s;and
<PB N="40" REF="41">
innocent nothings to employ me in, and I ve|rily believe it is the employment I am fitte&s;t for. I find my genius is exactly levelled to this tranquil &s;tate of indolence, without any of tho&s;e turbulent vici&s;&s;itudes of plea&s;ure and pain, which agitate the current of more impe|tuous &s;pirits.</P>
<P>I have now experienced, for the fir&s;t time in my life, that doing nothing is a very different thing from having nothing to do: I perceive there is in the former not only occupation enough for a rea&s;onable man, but an art and addre&s;s in the bu&s;ine&s;s, which the fair &s;ex,
<Q>Who&s;e trifling plea&s;es and whom trifles plea&s;e,</Q>
under&s;tand much better than we do.</P>
<P>I have rummaged his Lord&s;hip's library for books I never opened before, and made ac|quaintance with &s;everal ingenious e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts and even &s;ome noveli&s;ts, who have plea&s;ed me not a little: the&s;e gentry, who &s;eem to have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ecret of <HI>writing made ea&s;y,</HI> have taught me how to make reading &s;o; hi|therto I have been u&s;ed to &s;it down to the work, as a plowman does to his dinner, with a craving appetite and a voracious &s;wallow:
<PB N="41" REF="42">
reading the&s;e authors is in the vulgar phra&s;e <HI>as ea&s;y as cracking nuts</HI>; they &s;et before you a de&s;&s;ert of various confections, which are not calculated to appea&s;e your hunger, but to amu&s;e your palate; if you think fit to open the bauble, you di&s;cover &s;ome little motto or device within, which is &s;eldom worth the trou|ble of getting at it, and yet curio&s;ity draws us on from one to another: I have turned over abundance of the&s;e triflers, and have had the good luck always to &s;elect &s;omething tolerable to fill up an evening hour, when we came in from our walk.</P>
<P>It is now five days &s;ince Lord G. left us, and here we have remained without the inter|ruption of any one vi&s;itor till a certain per&s;on made his appearance this afternoon, of which I &s;hall give you the particulars by-and-by. You will expect I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of the ladies I have been living with in &s;o familiar a manner, but I am in no humour to undertake it; I cannot think it a fair way of proceeding, when I am entertained in a family, to &s;it down deliberately and delineate their per&s;ons and characters for the amu&s;ement of a corre&s;pon|dent, or for the &s;illy vanity of being ingenious
<PB N="42" REF="43">
at their co&s;t. How &s;hould I know any thing of the characters of the&s;e ladies in five days ac|quaintance? I abhor &s;uch impertinent affecta|tion, and I like it the le&s;s for the &s;urfeit I have had of de&s;criptions in my &s;hort acquaintance with the noveli&s;ts; their pourtraits of beauty, and their daubings of deformity, are commonly &s;o overcharged as to give me no idea of na|ture, and I dare &s;ay, if I was ridiculous enough to try my art upon the&s;e ladies, after a thou|&s;and fine no-meaning flouri&s;hes about the ma|tron beauties of the mother and the virgin graces of the blooming daughter, you would be no better acquainted with one atom of their per&s;ons or manners than you are at pre&s;ent. I &s;hall only tell you that the world agrees that Lady Loui&s;a is very hand&s;ome, and without having any prejudice for the world's opinions, I believe it is pretty certain that in this parti|cular the world is right: as I am much more experienced in mu&s;ic than in beauty, I am better able to pronounce upon her accom|pli&s;hments as a vocal and in&s;trumental per|former, which without exaggeration are extra|ordinary, and if my good word goes for any thing, it is no more than I ought to give her, for

&s;he had not half the &s;ame excu&s;e for the many fine compliments &s;he paid to my &s;craping.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, Charles, I was not half an hour in this young lady's company, before I had laid down a rule in my own thoughts, by which I mean to govern my&s;elf in certain particulars, which I have no de&s;ire to be very explicit upon even to you: and yet I mu&s;t con|dition with you to keep &s;acred from all ears and eyes the little that I &s;ay now and for ever, of per&s;ons more e&s;pecially, and even of things: a &s;cribbling tell-tale is a de&s;picable character, and yet I feel as if I could not totally re&s;train the effu&s;ions of my heart, when I corre&s;pond with you: if my confidence with you is ever violated, I renounce mankind.</P>
<P>For my own part, I do not know what love is; I never yet mea&s;ured weapons with him, and con&s;equently cannot tell whether he is really that formidable champion he is &s;aid to be: but as for this young lady we were &s;peaking of, though &s;he is my junior in age, I &s;u&s;pect &s;he is older in experience of a cer|tain &s;ort: I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e her to be a per|fect mi&s;tre&s;s of her weapons by the way in which &s;he manages them, and if a man can

parry the attack of her eyes, he will have little to fear from any others: I hope it will never be required of me to tell any other girl that &s;he is the mo&s;t beautiful creature in the world, for if I do, I &s;hall belye my own &s;en&s;es mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly: between Lady Loui&s;a and me there is &s;uch an impa&s;&s;able gulph, that I &s;hall never be fool-hardy enough to venture on it; and thanks be to fortune! it is too wide for the range of even her &s;hot to reach me acro&s;s it. She is at pre&s;ent a little lan|guid or &s;o, for I cannot &s;ay &s;he is actually ill; but even the languor of a fine lady, and e&s;pe|cially of &s;uch a favorite, is a &s;ufficient &s;um|mons for a con&s;ultation of phy&s;icians: they have very di&s;intere&s;tedly pre&s;cribed the air of the country and the &s;ide-&s;addle, and every day evinces the good &s;en&s;e and efficacy of their regimen: I have &s;ometimes been ob|liged to attend upon her on her rides, but I have oftener avoided it, and prefer to attach my&s;elf to Lady G. as the &s;afer companion of the two: with this mo&s;t excellent lady I have taken many delightful walks, and am &s;o charmed with her natural una&s;&s;uming cha|racter, that I have no re&s;erve in confiding to

her all tho&s;e &s;en&s;ibilities and emotions, which my &s;ituation awakens in me; even my awk|wardne&s;&s;es and apprehen&s;ions have not been di&s;gui&s;ed from her; &s;he conde&s;cends to them with the greate&s;t patience, rebukes me with gentlene&s;s, or fortifies me by encouragement; there are yet charms enough about her to give an inexpre&s;&s;ible grace to every thing &s;he &s;ays, but it is beauty which intere&s;ts without enflaming; it conciliates the affections with|out agitating the pa&s;&s;ions; it is Lady Loui&s;a her&s;elf advanced twenty years forward in life, and twenty times more &s;oft in manner; it is her meridian &s;un declining towards the we&s;t,
<Q>His beams entire, their fiercene&s;s lo&s;t.</Q>
Having been little u&s;ed to the familiar &s;ociety of women, it is almo&s;t incredible to relate what a degree of influence this elegant friend has already over me; &s;he is to be my coun|&s;ellor and confidante upon all difficult occa|&s;ions, and I feel as if I could never &s;uffer any &s;pot or &s;tain to fall upon my actions, for fear they &s;hould not be delicate enough for her in&s;pection. She has been very earne&s;t with me to in&s;truct her in a few of the ea&s;y
<PB N="46" REF="47">
and mo&s;t familiar topics of popular a&s;tro|nomy, and I have been obliged to comply; in return, &s;he is teaching me to play at che&s;s, but I believe &s;he is much more likely to be a rival of Sir I&s;aac than I am ever to be a match for Phillidore, for I can make no|thing of it, and if &s;he had not all the patience in the world &s;he would have given me up for an incorrigible blockhead before now.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know I am &s;o con&s;tituted as to revolt from every thing that in the lea&s;t approaches towards pedantry, and cannot bear the idea of being the academic of the com|pany; I am therefore a little mortified by this ta&s;k which Lady G. has impo&s;ed upon me, and go about it very awkwardly; nothing would &s;erve but I mu&s;t walk out with her la&s;t night, after Lady Loui&s;a had retired, to &s;hew her the con&s;tellations; I would fain have per&s;uaded her &s;he would take cold by the night-air, but that fetch would not &s;ave me, and I am afraid I did it with an ill grace at la&s;t; I have now more objections again&s;t it than what affect her health only, and I &s;hall not repeat the&s;e lectures any more: I do not think I am quite old enough, nor &s;ufficiently

&s;age, to expound the &s;tars to the up ca&s;t eyes of a fine woman, and there is &s;omething ri|diculous in my &s;etting up to be the Fontenelle of Lady G. unle&s;s I had either the gallantry of a Frenchman, or the <HI>&s;ang-froid</HI> of a phi|lo&s;opher.</P>
<P>This afternoon a certain Sir George Re|vel propo&s;ed him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of making a vi&s;it to the&s;e ladies: it is a&s;toni&s;hing with how ea&s;y an a&s;&s;urance a young man of fa|&s;hion carries off an impropriety of this &s;ort: I do not find he is by any means an intimate of the family; on the contrary I &s;u&s;pect his acquaintance commenced but a few days ago at a private ball, where he had the honor of dancing with Lady Loui&s;a; but this it &s;eems was in his opinion pretence enough for di&s;|pen&s;ing with forms, and in the ea&s;y &s;tile of mo|dern breeding he coolly rode up to the door, di&s;mounted, and delivered his hor&s;e to his groom, little doubting of a welcome.</P>
<P>For once he was mi&s;taken, and very likely this may have been the fir&s;t time his vanity betrayed him into a fal&s;e conclu&s;ion; but Lady G. had reconnoitred him at &s;ome di&s;tance, and &s;eemed on a &s;udden &s;o extremely fluttered
<PB N="48" REF="49">
by his coming, that I could do no le&s;s than offer my&s;elf for any me&s;&s;age &s;he thought fit to &s;end him. This offer &s;he accepted, and after many apologies de&s;ired I would take the trouble to make her excu&s;es to Sir George Revel for declining the honor of his vi&s;it, but that &s;he and Lady Loui&s;a &s;aw no com|pany at that place in the ab&s;ence of Lord G.</P>
<P>With this commi&s;&s;ion I repaired to the hall, where my gentleman was repo&s;ing him&s;elf, whil&s;t a &s;ervant was employed in wiping off the du&s;t from his boots. I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in as civil terms as I could u&s;e in delivering the me&s;&s;age I was charged with: he looked up in my face without &s;tirring from his chair, or moving the hat from his head, and with a &s;uitable air of in&s;olence demanded, who it was he was to thank for being the bearer of &s;o very civil a me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>I told him my name, but for any thanks due to me as the bearer of Lady G.'s me&s;&s;age, tho&s;e I informed him had been di&s;charged by the &s;ender, and none were either owing or ex|pected from Sir George Revel on this oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, replied he, &s;ince your name is

<P>Stop there, if you plea&s;e, &s;aid I, my commi&s;|&s;ion goes no further than to the delivery of Lady G.'s commands; I &s;hall carry no in&s;ult to a lady, nor receive one my&s;elf from any man.</P>
<P>Sir, your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant, an&s;wered he; if your anger is &s;o &s;oon rou&s;ed upon a very natural ob&s;ervation, I &s;hall take leave to &s;up|po&s;e that my lady's words may not perhaps have been quite &s;o peremptory as your report of them.</P>
<P>Sir George, I cannot let you take leave to &s;uppo&s;e that I am capable of varying one tittle from the truth in any ca&s;e.</P>
<P>How &s;o, Sir, when it is generally allowed that wits have &s;hort memories, and you who &s;eem to have the malice of a wit, may very well have the memory of one too.</P>
<P>This retort was rather more than I could bear, and thereupon &s;tepping nearer to him, I

ob&s;erved to him in a kind of whi&s;per, that &s;uch conver&s;ation was no longer proper for the hou&s;e we were in, and that I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon his &s;tepping out of it with me, where I would attend upon him to his hor&s;e, and take that opportunity of reque&s;ting him to inform me, where I might have the honor of waiting upon him in town to return the compliment he had ju&s;t now been plea&s;ed to pay me.</P>
<P>He reddened at this &s;peech, and without deigning to be&s;tow any an&s;wer flung out of the hou&s;e, and called for his hor&s;e: I followed him, and before he mounted again de&s;ired to know where I might call upon him.&mdash;What is your rea&s;on, Sir, &s;aid he, for demanding to know where I am to be met with? if you want any explanation of what I have &s;aid, explain to me in the fir&s;t place who and what you are, and &s;atisfy me that you are qualified as a gentle|man of birth and independance to call any words of mine into que&s;tion; till that is done, I &s;hall hold the bearer of &s;uch a me&s;&s;age as I have here received in ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion; and ex|cu&s;e my vanity if I ob&s;erve to you, Mr. Arun|del, that you mu&s;t be very young indeed in the

<P>Part of this proud &s;peech was delivered from his hor&s;e's back, and I had only time to tell him he &s;hould hear from me, when he wheeled about and &s;et off upon the &s;pur. I then re|turned into the hou&s;e and made a &s;hort report to Lady G. of Sir George Revel's departure without any comment whatever upon his be|havior to me.</P>
<P>Lady Loui&s;a, who had not been pre&s;ent when I received her mother's me&s;&s;age, was now &s;itting with her, and took very little notice of what had pa&s;&s;ed with re&s;pect to Sir George's vi&s;it, &s;imply ob&s;erving that Mr. Arundel had had a very trouble&s;ome office; &s;he &s;ate in a very thoughtful mood for &s;ome time, and now and then turned her eyes upon me with a look that I cannot pretend to inter|pret, but am not without &s;ome apprehen&s;ion there might be a degree of di&s;appointment in

It was not long before &s;he retired to her cham|ber complaining of the head-ach, and as &s;he cho&s;e to be alone, Lady G. and I were left to|gether: &s;he pre&s;&s;ed me to relate the particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed between Sir George and me, and &s;eemed very unea&s;y left &s;omething unplea|&s;ant had occurred, reproaching her&s;elf for hav|ing inadvertently accepted of my offer to take her me&s;&s;age: you can readily believe I omitted nothing to quiet her alarms, and &s;he conclud|ed by &s;aying&mdash;How could I be &s;o indi&s;creet to &s;end you to that in&s;olent, quarrel&s;ome young man, who is the terror of all companies, and who&s;e va&s;t fortune buoys him up in all manner of outrages again&s;t decency and good manners? if any thing en&s;ues to your harm I &s;hall never forgive my&s;elf; believe me, Mr. Arundel, when I a&s;&s;ure you that I &s;hould never enjoy another peaceful moment, if I was to turn his &s;word upon your life.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. Counte&s;s of G. to the Hon. Mrs. Dormer.</HEAD>
<P>I WRITE to you under the greate&s;t agony of mind. An affair has happened between young Arundel and that wretch Sir George Revel, which I improvidently gave occa&s;ion to. I cannot &s;end you particulars, for my mind is
<PB N="54" REF="55">
too much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to enlarge upon the &s;ubject. Mr. Arundel is wounded; whether dangerou&s;ly or not is more than I know, for though my Lord writes word it is only a &s;light &s;cratch, I am far from certain that he does not conceal the truth from me, as my &s;ervant Davi&s;on, who &s;aw the poor young man and &s;poke to him, tells me he was all over blood and very faint: &s;till he had the generous con&s;ideration for my ea&s;e to bid Davi&s;on a&s;&s;ure me that his wound was no|thing, and that he de&s;ired I would be under no alarm on his account, for that he &s;hould be with me in a day or two, if Lord G. would give him leave.</P>
<P>Now even this does not quiet my fears, and I mu&s;t entreat of you to call upon my Lord and inform your&s;elf of the truth, which I de&s;ire you will not di&s;gui&s;e from me, but &s;tate the ca&s;e without &s;oftening any one particular. I would have a&s;ked my Lord's permi&s;&s;ion to come to town my&s;elf, but that is become im|po&s;&s;ible, as I am now for the fir&s;t time &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed for Loui&s;a, who is confined to her chamber, and &s;o very low that I dare not leave her even for an hour in the day. We have carefully concealed from her this terrible

fracas, for to confe&s;s to you the whole &s;orrows of my heart, I am not without my fears, that this dete&s;table Sir George Revel is not indif|ferent to her, and that the great depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits &s;he is under is more the con&s;equence of di&s;appointment, than di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Alas! my worthy friend, &s;hould the&s;e &s;u&s;pi|cions be founded what a deplorable attach|ment has &s;he made, and what an unfortunate mother am I!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. Hon. Mrs. Dormer to the Counte&s;s of G.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE obeyed the commands of my dear Lady G. and have the happine&s;s to a&s;&s;ure you of Mr. Arundel's &s;afety from the very be&s;t authority.</P>
<P>I called in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare this morning at an early hour, hoping to find your Lord at lei&s;ure to &s;ee me: he was &s;o obliging as to let me in, and I had a few minutes conver&s;ation with him; he was very quick in di&s;covering that I had been &s;ent upon enquiries by you, and &s;aid, that, though he knew I was a &s;py, he &s;hould treat me as an honorable one, and give me all the information I was in &s;earch of: he then briefly &s;tated the particulars of Mr. Arun|del's rencontre with Sir George, which, though I &s;u&s;pect his Lord&s;hip to have &s;oftened in his relation of it, &s;eems to have been a very brutal and &s;candalous affair at the be&s;t.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve to you that Lord G. di&s;approves of your me&s;&s;age to Sir George,
<PB N="57" REF="58">
and thinks he ought to have been admitted; I hold it right to give you this hint, that you may not be taken by &s;urpri&s;e, if he &s;hould happen to launch out, as he is too apt to do, when any thing occurs to thwart his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>He cannot in his real opinion find fault with the prudence of your proceeding, nay he mu&s;t think it highly becoming; but I am afraid his eyes are wilfully &s;hut again&s;t the glaring impropriety of Sir George Revel's vi&s;it by con&s;iderations that do him no honor in my opinion: it is clear to me that his Lord&s;hip would have no objection to a propo&s;al from that quarter; the politics of Sir George at pre&s;ent are ho&s;tile to admini&s;tration, and his parliamentary influence, as you mu&s;t have heard, is very con&s;iderable, &s;o indeed is his property; the man in &s;hort has every re|commendation to a father, who wi&s;hes to make a match of intere&s;t, and form and fa&s;hion enough about him at the &s;ame time to catch the attention of any young lady, who chu&s;es her lover by the eye; &s;uch I &s;hould hope will never be the choice of my dear Lady Loui&s;a; &s;urely &s;he will never be the dupe of outward appearances, nor &s;ubmit her|&s;elf
<PB N="58" REF="59">
to be &s;acrificed to ambition and the love of riches. Her beauty, rank and fortune leave her without any plea for precipitation in the affair of marriage, and though her youth and extreme &s;u&s;ceptibility may &s;eem to lay her open to danger, yet &s;he has a kind and faithful friend for ever at her ear, who&s;e mater|nal vigilance will guard her from &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>When Lord G. had given me a &s;hort ac|count of the affair with Sir George Revel and made his own ob&s;ervations upon it, he called a &s;ervant and &s;ent him up to Mr. Arundel to know if it would be convenient to him to re|ceive a vi&s;it from a friend of Lady G.'s, offer|ing at the &s;ame time to accompany me to his apartment. I rather &s;tared at the propo&s;al, but when the &s;ervant returned with an an&s;wer from the wounded man, that he was ready to receive the honor we de&s;igned him and when my Lord &s;eemed to make a point of my going with him, I no longer he&s;itated about the matter, but &s;uffered him to introduce me to Mr. Arundel, who had ju&s;t been dre&s;&s;ed by his &s;urgeon and was lying on a couch.</P>
<P>After a few &s;light enquiries my Lord &s;lipt out of the room without my ob&s;erving him,
<PB N="59" REF="60">
whil&s;t I was in di&s;cour&s;e with the &s;urgeon, who was de&s;iring me to a&s;&s;ure your Lady&s;hip that his patient was in no manner of danger and would &s;oon be well. I then availed my&s;elf of the privilege of an old woman by entering into conver&s;ation with Mr. Arundel, and I mu&s;t take the &s;ame privilege for telling you that I never yet in my experience &s;aw the per&s;on, male or female, old or young, who impre&s;&s;ed my heart with &s;o &s;trong and &s;o favorable a pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as this amiable <HI>proteg&eacute;</HI> of your Lady|&s;hip's. I recollect in one of your letters that you &s;ay in a kind of parenthe&s;is that he is a fine young man, whereas if I was to de&s;cribe him to you it mu&s;t be as a model of perfection: for my part I am no dealer in de&s;criptions, be|cau&s;e I think they never de&s;cribe any per&s;on or any thing, but yet I pretend to be a better judge of human beauty than all the younger and more empa&s;&s;ioned beholders of it can be, becau&s;e I can now contemplate it with a mo&s;t philo&s;ophical eye in perfect tranquillity of &s;oul; I can look at Arundel as an arti&s;t at the &s;tatue of <HI>Antinous</HI>; I am glad I did not think of <HI>the dying gladiator,</HI> for that compari&s;on might have appeared ominous, e&s;pecially as his
<PB N="60" REF="61">
wound is de&s;cribed to me as being in the &s;elf|&s;ame place; but I under&s;tand it to be a glance with the edge of a cutting &s;word and not a &s;tab with the point.</P>
<P>I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to tell him as an ex|cu&s;e for my vi&s;it, that I came at your reque&s;t to inform my&s;elf truly and exactly of the &s;tate of his wound, on which account you were under much uncertainty and alarm, but I flatter my|&s;elf, added I, that I can now &s;et her mind at re&s;t in that particular, and I hope you will commi&s;&s;ion me to tell her at the &s;ame time that there are no other con&s;equences to be ap|prehended from the difference with Sir George Revel.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s this was going a little too far, and perhaps he thought &s;o, for he parried my cu|rio&s;ity in a way, that &s;eemed to indicate he was not very well plea&s;ed with it, telling me, that if I thought it worth my while to write upon &s;o trifling a &s;ubject as his difference with Sir George Revel, he hoped I would not mag|nify it into any thing, that could give you un|ea&s;ine&s;s, or repre&s;ent it otherwi&s;e than as a thing not worth a &s;econd thought of your's. I have had the honor, added he, to enjoy
<PB N="61" REF="62">
a few days only of Lady G.'s &s;ociety, but in tho&s;e few have received &s;o many marks of her conde&s;cen&s;ion and kindne&s;s, that nothing will ever deter me from obeying her commands, and a&s;&s;erting the delicacy of her behavior in the affair you allude to, in the face of any man who dares to arraign it.</P>
<P>This was &s;o palpable an eva&s;ion of my en|quiry that I could not venture upon pre&s;&s;ing it any further, and now a vi&s;itor being an|nounced I was obliged to cut &s;hort my vi&s;it and take leave.</P>

a very lame and erroneous account of a tran&s;action, which is even wor&s;e than they de|&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>I left Spring Grove in the morning before the family were &s;tirring, and repaired to the Coffee-hou&s;e, where Sir George informed me he was to be found: I recollected he &s;aid he was to be upon guard, and therefore deter|mined not to go armed to the meeting, as I knew his hands were, or at lea&s;t ought to be, tied up by the duty he was upon: as the occa|&s;ion of our difference was of &s;o delicate a na|ture, I thought it be&s;t to go alone, and indeed if I had been di&s;po&s;ed to take a friend with me, I had none to apply to. Having put up my hor&s;e in the Haymarket I walked directly to the Coffee-hou&s;e, and enquiring for Sir George, &s;ent in my name and de&s;ired to &s;peak with him in a private room: here I &s;taid a con&s;iderable time before the waiter returned and reported to me, that Sir George Revel was at breakfa&s;t in the public room, and bade him tell me if I had any thing to &s;ay to him, I might &s;ay it there; it did not &s;uit him to come out.</P>
<P>As I was very unwilling to come to an ex|planation
<PB N="63" REF="64">
with &s;o uncivil a man in a public Coffee-room, where it was to be apprehended certain names would be u&s;ed, that I was deter|mined &s;hould not get out if I could avoid it, I wrote him a &s;hort note, entreating him for obvious rea&s;ons to let me &s;ee him in private, a&s;&s;uring him that I was no otherwi&s;e equipt than in my riding-dre&s;s, unprovided with any means, and void of any wi&s;h to provoke him to a ho&s;tile di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the impropriety of which I was perfectly appri&s;ed of at the pre&s;ent mo|ment, as I knew he was upon guard and un|der&s;tood the delicacy of his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>This note was carried to him and an&s;wer brought back that he knew nothing of the writer, and &s;hould enter into no corre&s;pon|dence with me; I might come in or not as I &s;aw fit. The ma&s;ter of the Coffee-room now came to me, and de&s;ired I would not make his hou&s;e the &s;cene of any further altercation. I felt the ju&s;tice of this requi&s;ition, and a&s;&s;ur|ing him I would not, peaceably walked out: &s;till I kept my &s;tation before the door, expect|ing when this warrior would bolt, nor was it long before he made his appearance, leaning on the arms of two officers in their full uni|form,
<PB N="64" REF="65">
between whom he had entrenched him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>I immediately acco&s;ted him, taking off my hat at the &s;ame time and de&s;iring he would indulge me with a few minutes private con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I will indulge you, Sir, with no private conver&s;ation, cried he, till I am better certified of your preten&s;ions to conver&s;e with me at all: the&s;e gentlemen are my friends, and in their hearing you mu&s;t &s;peak, if you have any thing to &s;ay to me.</P>
<P>Sir George Revel, you have no right to que&s;tion my preten&s;ions, recollecting as you mu&s;t do in what family we met, when you thought fit to put an affront upon me.</P>
<P>Then go back to your Lord, and if you are in his &s;ervice, let your ma&s;ter certify for you, I &s;hall pay no more regard to what my Lady &s;ays in your behalf, than I do to the affronting me&s;&s;age, which you brought me on her's.</P>
<P>He had now turned the corner of Saint James's Place, when &s;tepping round and pre|&s;enting my&s;elf in front, as he &s;till kept walking on, I brought him and his party to a &s;top on the foot pavement. Harkye, Sir, &s;aid I, this
<PB N="65" REF="66">
language makes all further explanation need|le&s;s; if you do not in&s;tantly name a place of meeting, where I may have &s;atisfaction for this in&s;ult, as &s;oon as your guard is over, I will prote&s;t you for a coward to all the world.</P>
<P>Coward! exclaimed he, and in&s;tantly draw|ing his &s;word made a &s;troke at me with great violence, which pa&s;&s;ing between my arm and my body opened my &s;ide with the blade, and beat me on one knee to the ground; his exe|crations were horrid, and his pa&s;&s;ion &s;o enflam|ed, that if his brother officers had not caught hold of his arm, I am per&s;uaded he would have followed his blow, which in the po&s;ture I then was would probably have been fatal: my wound bled profu&s;ely, and a &s;udden faintne&s;s came over me, when fortunately an eminent &s;urgeon took me into his hou&s;e, clo&s;e to which the accident happened: a crowd of people in|&s;tantly collected, and the word being pa&s;&s;ed among&s;t them, that an unarmed man had been cut down by an officer upon guard, it was with &s;ome difficulty Sir George and his com|panions got into the &s;ame hou&s;e with me.</P>
<P>I believe the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in began now to be very thoroughly alarmed, but I &s;aw nothing of him,
<PB N="66" REF="67">
whil&s;t the &s;urgeon was u&s;ing means to &s;taunch the bleeding; as &s;oon as he a&s;&s;ured me it was not mortal, which from my own in&s;pection I was &s;ufficiently per&s;uaded of, I de&s;ired to &s;peak with the officers, who were in company with Sir George and witne&s;&s;es of the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>I have rea&s;on to believe they are both men of &s;trict honor and humanity, and &s;hall always be forward to render ju&s;tice to their behavior and expre&s;&s;ions on the occa&s;ion: they lament|ed that it had not been in their power to &s;top the perpetration of &s;o ba&s;e a deed; that they were both as much taken by &s;urpri&s;e as I my|&s;elf was; that as it was their unlucky chance to be pre&s;ent at the &s;cene, it would be their unplea&s;ant ta&s;k to report the proceeding faith|fully as it pa&s;&s;ed, and they feared it mu&s;t be &s;uch a report as would for ever bla&s;t the repu|tation of Sir George Revel, whom they could no longer con&s;ider as a brother of the corps.</P>
<P>I told them it was my earne&s;t wi&s;h this might be prevented, and that the redre&s;s I looked for from Sir George &s;hould affect his per&s;on only, not his profe&s;&s;ion. I could not pretend to &s;ay what the rules of their corps might require, but if any &s;aving could be
<PB N="67" REF="68">
made of his character, without prejudice to mine, I was content to give him a chance for pre&s;erving the name of a gentleman, if it were for no other rea&s;on than that he might &s;till be worthy to render &s;atisfaction to a gen|tleman.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon now interpo&s;ing, I was forbid|den to conver&s;e with them any longer, and having told them where I was to be found, they left me with every cordial wi&s;h for my &s;peedy recovery, and in truth they could not have left me in any hands more likely to co|operate with tho&s;e wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>And now, my deare&s;t Charles, as I full well know your ardent &s;oul has wings to carry you to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a friend, I mu&s;t condition with you in the mo&s;t &s;erious manner to abide where you are: if my life was in danger, you are of all men on earth he in who&s;e pre&s;ence there would be mo&s;t comfort, and in who&s;e friendly arms I could with mo&s;t &s;erenity re&s;ign my breath; but there is no danger in my ca&s;e: as for what mu&s;t follow with regard to my a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in, it is not in your line to help me, and you are the la&s;t per&s;on I &s;hould wi&s;h to con|ver&s;e with on &s;uch a &s;ubject, whil&s;t it hangs in
<PB N="68" REF="69">
&s;u&s;pen&s;e. I conjure you, therefore, as you value my repo&s;e, not to &s;tir a &s;tep towards me, but as much as po&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve that calm &s;erenity of &s;oul, that diffu&s;es peace on all who approach you, and makes a &s;phere of happine&s;s around you, of which your glowing and bene|volent heart is the center. Beware how you fix your thoughts too anxiou&s;ly upon one, who is entering upon a turbulent and unquiet world! The votary of religion &s;hould not too clo&s;ely attach him&s;elf to the dependant on for|tune: our harmony was uninterrupted whil&s;t we lived together; from our childhood we have been in&s;eparable; I am taken away and you are left; hard indeed would be your con|dition, were your &s;ympathetic heart &s;till to take a &s;hare in all the tumults and turmoils, that I perhaps am doomed to meet. Dear Charles, if it be po&s;&s;ible think of me only in tho&s;e tranquil hours, that will give you plea&s;ure to reflect upon; and if the &s;tory of my life &s;hall prove a tragic one, proceed no further than to the opening &s;cenes of the drama, and drop the curtain of oblivion over the cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>Your temper was the model that I &s;tudied, yet I could never bring my pa&s;&s;ions to &s;o mild
<PB N="69" REF="70">
a quality as your's; &s;till your example, your &s;ociety, your interchange of &s;oul &s;oftened and meliorated my imperfect nature: that charm|ing dream is now di&s;&s;olved; the band is bro|ken that tied down my pa&s;&s;ions, and I am let loo&s;e upon the world with all my feelings and with all my faults. If the &s;word of Sir George Revel, when it &s;truck at my heart, had been permitted to reach it, perhaps it might have cut out of the catalogue many a di&s;graceful item, which your generous friend&s;hip may hereafter blu&s;h to read.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s to you I feel my&s;elf at this mo|ment in an exigency, where I want the advice of a friend well practi&s;ed in the rules of honor, and yet I have none &s;uch at hand to re&s;ort to.

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. Arundel to Mortlake.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the officers, who was pre&s;ent when I received my wound, has been here and informs me that Sir George Revel has given in his commi&s;&s;ion, and it is thought he will be allowed to re&s;ign; this he did to &s;top the en|quiries that mu&s;t el&s;e have been made into his behavior, and particularly as the tran&s;action pa&s;&s;ed upon guard, con&s;equences might have been &s;erious to him. This young officer, who
<PB N="71" REF="72">
is married to one of the mo&s;t lovely and ac|compli&s;hed women of the age, &s;eems a very honorable and amiable character; he &s;poke of my affair with all the ju&s;t abhorrence that belongs to it; he wi&s;hed to know what I had written to Sir George in the note I &s;ent into the Coffee-room, and when I repeated the contents, which I have tran&s;cribed in my ye&s;|terday's letter to you, he ob&s;erved that &s;uch a conciliating me&s;&s;age was a heinous aggrava|tion of the act, which followed it; that he had been publickly called upon by his brother offi|cers to &s;tate all the proceedings, but that he had hitherto declined entering into particulars, till he had conver&s;ed with me and was ap|pri&s;ed not only of my pre&s;ent wi&s;hes but like|wi&s;e of my future purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>I did not he&s;itate to reply, that my future purpo&s;es could be &s;uch only as were nece&s;&s;ary for a man of honor to take, and which I pre|&s;umed need not be pointed out to him.</P>
<P>He then &s;aid that he felt him&s;elf bound in honor to convince me that he was no a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Sir George's in &s;o &s;candalous an affair; and therefore though he felt a repugnance again&s;t urging any man to an act of re&s;ent|ment,
<PB N="72" REF="73">
and had always made it his &s;tudy to keep out of per&s;onal affairs, yet if I was not better provided and thought fit to accept his &s;ervices for obtaining &s;atisfaction of the aggre&s;|&s;or, either in a peaceable manner, if that could be done, or by the la&s;t extremity, if it could not, he was heart and hand at my &s;ervice, adding that he owned he &s;hould not be &s;orry to mark to the world his abhorrence of &s;uch &s;candalous proceedings, which had rou&s;ed the re&s;entment of the whole corps, and his more immediately as a party pre&s;ent:&mdash;in what he had now &s;aid, he &s;poke the &s;en&s;e al&s;o of the other officer, who was in the like misfortune with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The mode&s;t unaffected air with which he delivered him&s;elf, and the genuine glow of &s;en&s;ibility and true courage which &s;hewed it|&s;elf in his countenance, whil&s;t he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, won my heart upon the in&s;tant and henceforth I honor him as my friend:&mdash;but I will never con&s;ent to his propo&s;al, nor will I rack the feelings of a beloved wife by expo&s;ing her hu&s;band to danger; I accordingly declined the honor he did me, and I hope in a manner that expre&s;&s;ed my &s;en&s;e of his gene|ro&s;ity
<PB N="73" REF="74">
without wounding it, a&s;&s;uring him at the &s;ame time that I &s;hould take the mo&s;t public and explicit means of clearing his conduct and that of his brother officer from all po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;con&s;truction.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he did not expect Sir George Re|vel would make any conce&s;&s;ions or offer at atonement; that he was a man of a ferocious, haughty &s;pirit, elated with the influence which an overgrown e&s;tate gave him, and pluming him&s;elf on his extraordinary &s;kill and addre&s;s in the &s;cience of the &s;word: he had heard him talk very lavi&s;hly of Lady Loui&s;a's charms, and throw out very broad hints as if he was &s;ecure of being favorably received by her: Lady G. was his aver&s;ion, but as his parlia|mentary weight was con&s;iderable, (having two boroughs under his command) he made little doubt of his propo&s;als being acceptable to the father of the young lady, who knew the import|ance of his &s;upport and the turn which &s;uch an alliance would give to his politics. In fine, this friendly officer advi&s;ed me, if the affair mu&s;t come to a ho&s;tile i&s;&s;ue, to draw him out upon foreign ground, and &s;ecure my&s;elf from con&s;equences that might under certain cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="74" REF="75">
throw me into a very dangerous predicament.</P>
<P>With this caution he left me, and I need not tell you that we parted with many ac|knowledgments on my &s;ide and repeated good wi&s;hes on his.</P>
<P>I told you in my la&s;t that I had not ven|tured upon re&s;orting to my uncle Sir Francis Arundel, nor did I pre&s;ume upon the liberty of writing a line to him in con&s;equence of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation; even his per&s;on was not known to me, for I believe I had never &s;een him &s;ince I was &s;ix years old.</P>
<P>Judge what my &s;urpri&s;e mu&s;t have been when a &s;ervant announcing him by name, u&s;h|ered in a maje&s;tic martial figure in the uniform of a General: I ro&s;e with &s;ome difficulty from my couch, and as he tendered me his hand, pre&s;&s;ed it re&s;pectfully to my lips:&mdash;Child, child! cried he, return to your couch; con&s;ult your &s;ituation, and when you are recovered from the &s;urpri&s;e of this unexpected meeting, I will &s;peak to you. He led me back by the hand, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in arranging my po&s;ture, and then with great &s;tate and deliberation &s;eated him&s;elf at &s;ome di&s;tance in a chair. After a &s;hort &s;ilence
<PB N="75" REF="76">
I began to attempt at expre&s;&s;ing my &s;en&s;e of the honor and kindne&s;s he conferred upon me.&mdash;Why yes, Nephew, cried he, methinks it is &s;omething more than your neglect of me de&s;erved; but I am willing to a&s;cribe it to your diffidence, nay, I can well &s;uppo&s;e you acted under influence of your father's fooli&s;h coun&s;el, from whom I have long &s;ince and for ever withdrawn my countenance and protec|tion. But, Sir, you are now to know that Francis Arundel will &s;upport the honor of his name, though it de&s;cends upon the &s;on of a brother he has renounced. I have beeen told of your affair; I &s;ee you are wounded, and &s;o far the fact is verified: report gives it forth that you was unarmed, and the act, if that be &s;o, was the act of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. How &s;tands the truth, Sir? let me hear it from your own lips; and recollect your&s;elf, do you mind me, call to mind before whom you &s;peak, and do not di&s;gui&s;e or qualify your conduct in the mi|nute&s;t particular.</P>
<P>With this injunction I immediately com|plied, by giving him a circum&s;tantial detail of the whole tran&s;action from fir&s;t to la&s;t, which he heard throughout with the greate&s;t atten|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="77">When I had concluded, he delivered him&s;elf as follows:&mdash;Nephew Francis, you have been very ill u&s;ed, and at the &s;ame time I &s;ee nothing in your conduct to di&s;approve of; on the contrary you &s;eem to have deported your|&s;elf, &s;o far as your account goes, as becomes a man of honor: What have you now re&s;olved upon as your next &s;tep?</P>
<P>I then opened to him what my purpo&s;e was, which I told him I &s;ubmitted to his better judgment, and &s;hould gladly be directed by him in any &s;teps he would recommend, who &s;o well knew what honor required and what was due to the dignity of a name and family, which I hoped I was not born ever to di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was uttering the&s;e words his coun|tenance brightened with joy, and &s;tarting up from his chair, he exclaimed with an oath, that I was a boy after his own heart; and if I was not wounded he would hug me in his arms: that it was not for his age and rank in the army to turn out again&s;t &s;uch a whip&s;ter as Sir George Revel, neither would it become &s;o near a relation as an uncle to go into the field with his own nephew; but I &s;hould not want a &s;econd, a gallant fellow, one of my own age, and as it was a family affair one of my own
<PB N="77" REF="78">
name and kindred&mdash;in &s;hort he &s;hould intro|duce his &s;on to me in that capacity, who was captain of a troop of light hor&s;e, and now luckily at lei&s;ure for &s;uch an expedition. We &s;hall then &s;ee if this cowardly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;hall e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed for his in&s;ult. In the mean time, my brave lad, take care of your&s;elf, and get your &s;kin whole as fa&s;t as you can.</P>
<P>So &s;aying he got up, as if to depart, but &s;eeming to recollect him&s;elf&mdash;Harkye, Frank, &s;ays he, I had like to have forgot part of my errand&mdash;Perhaps you are unfurni&s;hed for this job, and I &s;uppo&s;e you are not too proud to accept a pre&s;ent from your uncle.</P>
<P>On the contrary, I replied, I &s;hall be ju&s;tly proud of any favor you are plea&s;ed to &s;hew me, but in point of money I am provided by the bounty of my uncle John.</P>
<P>No matter for that, &s;aid he, a few hundreds will not overburthen you, nor impoveri&s;h me; be&s;ides you have &s;tept into a new &s;ituation here, and though I think we have &s;ome claim upon Lord G. for the &s;upport I and my &s;on have always given him in parliament, I &s;hall not chu&s;e that your appearance in his family &s;hall be that of a needy dependant: here, my
<PB N="78" REF="79">
boy, take this (throwing down three bank notes of a hundred each) as an earne&s;t of my good-will; do your&s;elf ju&s;tice and you &s;hall never want a friend, whil&s;t you and I are alive.</P>
<P>With the&s;e words he ha&s;tened out of the room, and was gone before I could make reply or rai&s;e my&s;elf from my couch to pay him the re&s;pect that was due to him.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Charles, I have been re|peating to you a conver&s;ation, which in tender|ne&s;s to your friendly feelings I &s;hould not have done, had it not been contra&s;ted by one, which followed it in &s;o oppo&s;ite &s;tile, that you may very well expect a more peaceable termination of this affair, than the preceding intelligence &s;eems to threaten.</P>
<P>Lord G. has ju&s;t been with me, to &s;ay that at Sir George Revel's reque&s;t he had an inter|view with him early this morning, in which he had debated the circum&s;tances which gave the fir&s;t occa&s;ion to our quarrel; and though he mu&s;t acknowledge my delicacy in not &s;peaking of them to him, and held him&s;elf obliged to me for my attention to Lady G.'s de&s;ires, yet he &s;hould have been exceedingly glad that no &s;uch rebuff had been given on her part to Sir
<PB N="79" REF="80">
George's vi&s;it, who, though he may not be altogether &s;o agreeable to her Lady&s;hip, would perhaps have been no unwelcome vi&s;itor to others of his family; at all events it &s;eemed contrary to good policy as well as good man|ners to put any affront upon a per&s;on of his great fortune, influence and connections: as for his a&s;&s;ault upon me, it was an act of violence, which though committed under a &s;udden impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, nothing could ju&s;tify; Sir George him&s;elf did not attempt to ju&s;tify it, yet he thought it would admit of &s;ome allowances, for where was the man of &s;pirit, who could endure to hear him&s;elf called coward, and yet keep his &s;word in the &s;cab|bard? That he had already &s;hewn his di&s;po&s;i|tion towards atonement, by putting him&s;elf out of his profe&s;&s;ion, and it was now with his Lord&s;hip to &s;ay what el&s;e &s;hould be done towards the party aggrieved.</P>
<P>Here I was about to make reply, when his Lord&s;hip &s;topt me by re&s;uming his di&s;cour&s;e in the words which follow:&mdash;When I &s;tate to you, that Sir George was willing to refer him|&s;elf to me as a mediator, I &s;hould not di&s;gui&s;e from you that it was implied conditionally, in
<PB N="80" REF="81">
ca&s;e I &s;hould take up his cau&s;e upon the fir&s;t grounds of the quarrel, by giving my &s;anction to the preten&s;ions, which carried him to my hou&s;e. You will readily under&s;tand where this points.</P>
<P>Now, though I don't pretend to decide upon my daughter's inclinations, I am free to &s;ay that no father, be his ambition what it may, can object to the fortune, rank or family of Sir George Revel. His e&s;tate I know to be a va&s;t one, and he mu&s;t have been left exceeding rich in ready money. He has two boroughs, which are ab&s;olutely his own, and repre&s;ents the county he lives in; &s;o that his parliamentary influence, which has hitherto gone again&s;t us, is no &s;mall object, as you mu&s;t confe&s;s: in &s;hort he is a match for the fir&s;t lady in the kingdom. I am candid with you therefore in &s;aying, that if your matter can be accommodated, I can have no he&s;itation in u&s;ing my influence over Lady Loui&s;a in Sir George's favor: upon this condition he is willing to come to terms with you, and &s;ubmits the mediation to me; I will never &s;uppo&s;e you are &s;o little the friend of me and my family, or by nature and principle &s;o devoted to de&s;perate and re&s;entful mea&s;ures,
<PB N="81" REF="82">
as to with&s;tand a proper and gentlemanly atonement, when you may be a&s;&s;ured I will never con&s;ent to any thing that &s;hall put a force upon your feelings, or leave a &s;tain upon your honor. You &s;ee, Mr. Arundel, how con|fidentially I deal with you in this affair; you &s;ee where my intere&s;t, political as well as do|me&s;tic, points, and it is now in your power by facilitating an accommodation, not only to &s;ave your&s;elf from almo&s;t inevitable de&s;truction, but to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a merit with me as will render me your effectual friend for life.</P>
<P>There is no occa&s;ion to tell you all my an&s;wer to this, you &s;ee enough of Lord G.'s wi&s;hes to conclude that every thing will be done on his part to terminate this affair amica|bly, and you know enough of me to believe that I am not of a re&s;entful and bloody di&s;po|&s;ition; and would it not be a &s;avage act in me to bla&s;t the happine&s;s of &s;o lovely a creature as Lady Loui&s;a by &s;acrificing her lover and the man &s;he loves to my vengeance?

<HEAD>LETTER XV. Charles Mortlake to Arundel.</HEAD>
<P>AH my friend! do you deal fairly with me, and can you think me &s;o &s;hallow-&s;ighted as not to detect your effort at deceiving me? Is the la&s;t paragraph of your letter the real language of your heart? It is not. Why did you &s;uppre&s;s your an&s;wer to Lord G.'s ha|rangue about amicable &s;atisfaction? Why, but becau&s;e that an&s;wer would have cut up the fal&s;e delu&s;ive hopes, which his di&s;cour&s;e is intended to convey? But you are mi&s;taken; it conveys no hopes to me; I know you too well to believe he has any intere&s;t to divert your mind from the mo&s;t rigid adherence to tho&s;e
<PB N="83" REF="84">
&s;anguinary laws, which honor, that Moloch of the world's idolatry, has impo&s;ed upon its votaries. How often have you and I di&s;puted this point of duelling! and how little have I ever gained upon your mind by tho&s;e conver|&s;ations! You have now introduced a new character on the &s;cene, your uncle the Gene|ral, who &s;eems a ma&s;ter of the art, a profe&s;&s;or of modern honor, and I perceive the malady is in your blood, a kind of family di&s;ea&s;e, not to be eradicated by my Lord's feeble emollients. No, my dear Frank, you throw a very thin cover upon the real purpo&s;e of you heart, when you affect to a&s;k if it would not be a <HI>&s;avage act to bla&s;t the character of Lady Loui&s;a:</HI> this is not your natural language; truth makes no parade, and your under&s;tanding would not &s;toop to &s;uch trite unmeaning que&s;tions, if you was as willing to do, as you are competent to di&s;cern, what is right. But that your que&s;tion, in&s;incere as it is, may not &s;tand unan&s;wered by me, I do &s;ay that it is a &s;avage act to bla&s;t the happine&s;s even of a per&s;on, who has &s;o &s;mall a &s;hare of your acquaintance as Lady Loui&s;a; how much more of one who loves you as Lady G.! and yet I am apt to believe
<PB N="84" REF="85">
there is a heart, in which the wound will &s;ink &s;till deeper than in her's, a heart, which at this very moment throbs with agony, whil&s;t it re|flects upon the horrid purpo&s;e you are medi|tating.</P>
<P>Do you &s;uppo&s;e I cannot now account for all the time and pains you have devoted to the &s;cience of the &s;word? why was you for ever at the practice with your fencing-ma&s;ter? Not for the rea&s;on you gave me, becau&s;e it was a whole&s;ome exerci&s;e, a graceful relaxation in the intervals of &s;tudy. You providently made your&s;elf perfect in the theory, well knowing that the time was in advance, when you mu&s;t carry it into practice.</P>
<P>But I have done; what I have &s;aid is enough for lamentation; nothing that I could add would &s;uffice for conviction. And therefore, my beloved friend, to the protection of Pro|vidence and the government of your own in|vincible &s;pirit I commit you: may that art you have &s;tudied be your defence; may that ho|nor you pur&s;ue be your reward; and may the wound you now &s;uffer be the only one you &s;hall ever receive from the hand of the &s;ame murderous a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="86">I know nothing of the world you live with, their rules and opinions cannot be controvert|ed by me, for I have neither age, experience, rank or preten&s;ions to oppo&s;e to their autho|rity: I take for granted the a&s;&s;ault is &s;uch as in the language of honor excludes apology, and that the only po&s;&s;ible atonement Sir George Revel can make for attempting to kill you, is by giving you a chance of killing him: be it &s;o! if &s;o the law &s;tands, tho&s;e, who acknowledge the law, mu&s;t obey the law: at the &s;ame time, with humble deference to the law-makers, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve it is extremely favorable to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, as it offers him a &s;e|cond chance of doing that, of which he has been once di&s;appointed, and, when the die of fate is to be thrown, gives him two ca&s;ts to your one.</P>
<P>I have hitherto &s;uppo&s;ed that the laws of our country gave us redre&s;s again&s;t a&s;&s;aults; but when men of principle, lovers of ju&s;tice, (and who has nobler principles, who loves ju&s;|tice more than your&s;elf?) do not apply to tho&s;e laws, how can I &s;uppo&s;e any &s;uch are in exi&s;tence?

Your better knowledge of the world can no doubt expound this riddle, and reconcile the&s;e &s;eeming contradictions,</P>
<P>You forbid me coming to you: I will obey you, for, though nothing would prevent me from flying to your misfortunes, I &s;hould be an unwilling witne&s;s of your errors; nor could the world pre&s;ent to me a more afflicting &s;pec|tacle than a friend, endowed by nature with a &s;pirit of benevolence, perverted by a compli|ance with the fa&s;hions of the world to a prin|ciple of revenge, and thinking no atonement compleat till the wrong is expiated with the blood of the offender.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. Arundel to Charles Mortlake.</HEAD>
<P>IF the fa&s;hions and opinions of mankind were amenable to the laws of rea&s;on and religion, I admit with you that no &s;uch prac|tice as that of duelling could exi&s;t; perhaps the &s;word it&s;elf might be a weapon out of u&s;e, or at mo&s;t be carried peaceably before the chief magi&s;trate of the &s;tate, or hung up in terrorem as an emblem of ju&s;tice, and not brandi&s;hed as now by the hand of the warrior as an in&s;trument of human &s;laughter.</P>
<P>But it is one thing to confute the world's opinions by argument, another thing to oppo&s;e them by practice. Now it mu&s;t be owned that there is &s;omething in the term Coward &s;o hateful to our ears, that it is more than human nature can put up with to &s;ubmit to the re|proach: the &s;tigma is &s;o terrible, that it is not enough to be con&s;cious of not de&s;erving it; the infamy annexed to it is &s;o general, that it reduces a man to a &s;tate of &s;olitude, drives

him out of all the comforts, all the &s;ocieties of life, and renders him the object of univer&s;al contempt. If then the world will not hear my rea&s;on for refu&s;ing a challenge, if it will not credit me for tho&s;e con&s;cientious motives upon which I decline a duel, but with one voice and one mind will ri&s;e up again&s;t me, and hi&s;s my &s;cruples out of countenance, what &s;hall I do? &s;hall I retire to the woods and the groves, and &s;hrink from the face of my friends, quitting <HI>the chearful haunts of men</HI> to fea&s;t upon my own meditations in retire|ment, and triumph in the martyrdom of ho|nor at the altar of religion? Who will do this? or grant that there was virtue found in man &s;ufficient for the ta&s;k, will his example profit or reform the world? Certainly it will not, becau&s;e the world will never impute it to the true principle, but univer&s;ally a&s;cribe it to the mean motives of fear and &s;elf-pre&s;erva|tion? Now if all examples <HI>are given us for edi|fication,</HI> and none can po&s;&s;ibly be drawn from mine, to what good purpo&s;e is my honor &s;a|crificed? Why am I to &s;eparate my&s;elf from the great bulk of mankind, and &s;eceding upon principle join tho&s;e, who have de&s;erted from
<PB N="89" REF="90">
cowardice, whereby my virtue will be melted into the dregs of their infamy, and the good and the bad be made one common ma&s;s, with|out u&s;e or benefit to any living creature?</P>
<P>Without controverting any one of your ar|guments, let me a&s;k you if I, Francis Arun|del, a new and unknown being, drawn out of ob&s;curity (Heaven knows how unwillingly) and ju&s;t &s;tepping forth into the world, if I am the one dauntle&s;s individual to &s;tem the tyranny of an univer&s;al fa&s;hion. I may retreat, you will tell me, to my primitive ob&s;curity, and hide my head in the oziers on the banks of Cam; but I &s;hall retreat with ignominy; I &s;hall grow loath&s;ome to my&s;elf; I &s;hall lo&s;e that con&s;cious pride, which is the very &s;oul of energy; even my books will be no longer a re&s;ource, for their authors will ri&s;e up in judg|ment again&s;t me; every hero will frown upon me as I peru&s;e his annals, and every page will &s;trike the blu&s;h of &s;hame into my cheeks: la&s;t of all, as the completion of my mi&s;ery, you, my dear Charles, even you, the very au|thor and advi&s;er of my undoing, you will fall from me, and the friend of my life will be a&s;hamed any longer to acknowledge his own melancholy convert.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">But &s;hall I only plead pre&s;cription in de|fence of what I am doing, will not the &s;ubject bear the te&s;t of argument? I am a&s;&s;aulted by a gentleman at the point of his &s;word, wound|ed, &s;truck and publicly in&s;ulted as a de&s;pica|ble fellow, who has no right to be heard, no preten&s;ions to remon&s;trate upon equal terms of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The &s;pirit of a Quaker would ri&s;e again&s;t &s;uch an in&s;ult: what then am I to do? patiently bind up my wounds, and make him a pre&s;ent of that blood, which is nobler than any his veins contain, who drew it from me? Or &s;hall I pro&s;ecute for a&s;&s;ault and battery, and pre&s;ent an indictment upon oath that I was put in bodily fear? I tell you, Charles, I will not be perjured by the forms of law, when I can be righted by the laws of honor.</P>
<P>It is well for &s;ociety, (under correction of religion let me &s;peak it) it is happy for the order, the repo&s;e and good manners of the world, that they are not left to the regulations of the law alone; if I am to put up with every affront, that does not break my bones, I mu&s;t dive&s;t my heart of every feeling towards truth, humanity and candour, every &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice
<PB N="91" REF="92">
towards the character of an ab&s;ent friend, every tenderne&s;s for my own, before I commit my&s;elf to a company of my fellow-creatures, who&s;e offences could no otherwi&s;e be corrected but as they were actionable: whil&s;t there is any di&s;tinction to be made between a breach of the peace and a breach of good manners, &s;omething mu&s;t be found to reach tho&s;e tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es, which the judge upon the bench can take no cognizance of. Who will be the protector of the fair &s;ex, where will be the &s;helter for their delicacy, what will &s;top the mouth of ob&s;cenity? Neither judge nor jury. What would become of all tho&s;e mi&s;-&s;hapen and imperfect beings, nature's neglected off|&s;pring, who&s;e infirmities and di&s;tortions would make them the butts and buffoons of the rude and boi&s;terous &s;ons of health and vigour, if there was not a re&s;ort open to them, which levels the &s;tronge&s;t to the weake&s;t? and thanks to that invention, which has armed the feeble family of decrepitude with an in&s;trument, that can awe the in&s;olence of the bully, and can carry death into the brea&s;t of the giant from the hand of the pigmy.</P>
<P>Tell me how many virtues are compounded
<PB N="92" REF="93">
in your general definition of true politene&s;s, and I will prove to you that every one of tho&s;e component virtues are indebted to the re&s;ource of duelling for their place in &s;ociety. Let &s;peculation calculate the frays, the litigations, the di&s;putes, the brutal violences, that would overthrow &s;ociety, and then compute if the peace, order and happine&s;s of mankind would not &s;uffer infinitely more interruption from them, than from all our duels, which on an average do not rob the community of more than two or three members in the year. Even morality is intere&s;ted in the continuance of this check upon the pa&s;&s;ions and exce&s;&s;es of man|kind: it is a curb in the mouth of the drunkard, for the man who is quarrel&s;ome in his cups, learns to re&s;train his propen&s;ity from appre|hen&s;ion of the con&s;equences: there are many, who will not &s;uffer decency to be too gro&s;sly violated, none will endure the defamer of fe|male reputation, and though the &s;ervants of religion are the &s;ons of peace, there are &s;ome loyal &s;pirits, who do not wear the livery of the altar, yet will not &s;uffer the God they love and adore to be bla&s;phemed, nor the faith, into which they are enli&s;ted, to be made the topic
<PB N="93" REF="94">
of ridicule and the butt of ribaldry. Are there penalties in our &s;tatutes for all the&s;e various de&s;criptions of offence? Can attornies &s;ettle all the decencies, the decorums of &s;ociety? Will a jury find damages for my nerves, and can I pro&s;ecute for a&s;&s;ault and battery upon the &s;en&s;ibility of my heart?</P>
<P>Read your public prints; peru&s;e the bloody page, where the vital reputation of your friend is di&s;&s;ected before your eyes for your morning recreation; the villain is without the law, it cannot reach him; the printer defies you; it is no libel, the author is anonymous. Why does he conceal his name? not becau&s;e he fears the law, but becau&s;e the coward dare not face your re&s;entment for the lye he has forged: and were there no per&s;onal re&s;entment to dread, the &s;currilities of a new&s;paper would become the talk of the table, and the da&s;tardly defamer, who now &s;tabs you in a paragraph, would in|&s;ult you face to face, and unle&s;s there was a lawyer in company, you would never know where to lay your damages.</P>
<P>Take notice I have nothing to &s;ay to the gentlemen, who fight duels for fame's &s;ake. Is law of no benefit to &s;ociety, becau&s;e men
<PB N="94" REF="95">
will re&s;ort to it from a litigious &s;pirit? Per&s;o|nal &s;atisfaction is not to be demanded, till peaceable &s;atisfaction is refu&s;ed, and then only when the injury is of a &s;ort, which according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed modes of honor cannot be referred to the law, or if referred, cannot be properly redre&s;&s;ed. Now it &s;o happens that per&s;onal injuries and affronts are generally &s;uch, as are either too undefineable for the no|tice of law, or too great for its due correction; of the former &s;ort, the lye flatly given, is what no man's &s;pirit can put up with, yet there is no legal redre&s;s for it whatever; of the latter &s;ort, a blow is indeed a breach of the peace, but the in&s;ult does not con&s;i&s;t in the violence, with which one gentleman &s;trikes another, and yet the law will take that only into contem|plation, which in the &s;en&s;e of honor is no ag|gravation of the injury; on the contrary the very rever&s;e obtains, for (as in the ca&s;e of my wound) that, which injures the per&s;on mo&s;t may very po&s;&s;ibly affect the honor lea&s;t.</P>
<P>One more remark your patience will in|dulge me in with re&s;pect to my proficiency in the art of fencing: when I profe&s;&s;ed to &s;tudy it as an athletic and &s;alutary exerci&s;e, I did not
<PB N="95" REF="96">
fore&s;ee any other u&s;es I was ever likely to ap|ply it to; at all events I had no purpo&s;es in contemplation but defen&s;ive ones; and in that light I mu&s;t con&s;ider it as a happy circum|&s;tance that I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an art, which in all probability will enable me to guard my own vitals from an adver&s;ary's &s;word, and guide mine, where the &s;troke &s;hall not be mor|tal.</P>

I noted his behavior at the ball, where he fir&s;t met her, danced with her and behaved as I think would revolt a woman of delicacy: in&s;en&s;ible, licentious wretch, he knows not what true love &s;hould be.
<Q><L>Love &s;hould be pure,</L>

But I tell you again with this wretch &s;he is in love; with the dire&s;t enemy of my peace, with the object of my eternal hatred, terror and aver&s;ion, is the child of my affection fatally in love: mi&s;erable mother that I am! what have I &s;uffered, what am I not yet to &s;uffer for her &s;ake! I have had an interview with my Lord, in which he has not only thrown all patience out of &s;ight, but di&s;tanced every thing that ever went before for violence and rage: when I tell you that he did not &s;trike me, I tell you the only in&s;ult he ab&s;tained from. Tears, apo|logies, entreaties had no effect upon him; when his overbearing cruelty had lowered me to a &s;tate of humiliation, which no human creature &s;hould be reduced to by another, re|collection &s;eized me; my nature revolted again&s;t &s;uch meanne&s;s, and I recovered &s;o much under&s;tanding of my own dignity as to break forth into the following expo&s;tulation:&mdash;My Lord, you bear &s;o hard upon me, and

pre&s;s a wounded &s;pirit with &s;uch unremitting cruelty, that I &s;hould be unworthy of the name and character you have honored me with, I &s;hould be your &s;lave and not your wife, if I was any longer to &s;ubmit my&s;elf to your re|proaches: as I perceive it is impo&s;&s;ible to mol|li&s;y your heart, there is nothing left for me but to attempt to harden mine to an in&s;en&s;ibility of your unkindne&s;s.</P>
<P>With the&s;e words I left him, and indeed he did not offer at a reply; I believe he was a good deal &s;tartled to &s;ee the trampled worm retort upon its oppre&s;&s;or. He is now gone to pay his court to his &s;overeign, to &s;mile and bow, and &s;often his ferocious features into the timid air of flattery and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t I remain at home a &s;ilent &s;ufferer under his dome&s;tic tyranny.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone I ha&s;tened to offer my apologies where they were really due; but how different was my reception there! He, who might ju&s;tly have complained of his &s;uf|ferings for my &s;ake, would not permit me even to condole with him on the misfortunes which I had brought upon him. Ah, my dear, but imprudent friend, why would you even
<PB N="102" REF="103">
touch upon &s;o dangerous a &s;ubject as the de|&s;cription of his per&s;on? Lo&s;s of blood and the di&s;cipline con&s;equential of his wound have indeed dimini&s;hed the lu&s;tre, but not im|paired the &s;en&s;ibility of his countenance; the languor, that has po&s;&s;e&s;t it&s;elf of his features, makes them only more intere&s;ting than they were. I was to blame for not taking more time to compo&s;e my&s;elf before I &s;aw him, for he immediately di&s;covered that I had been in tears, nay, I am afraid the very tears betray|ed them&s;elves, for you need not be told how very &s;oon the heart is melted into pity, when it has been previou&s;ly &s;ubdued by &s;orrow; and surely it was a touching &s;pectacle to &s;ee him &s;tretched upon a couch, his body &s;wathed with wrappers, his eyes red with pain, and his active limbs deprived of their motion. He no|ticed the di&s;order I was in, and in truth it could not be concealed. After fixing his eyes upon me &s;ome time with the mo&s;t com|pa&s;&s;ionate and tender re&s;pect, he &s;hook his head, and in a faint tone demanded, if this could be the way to cure him of his wound, by tran&s;planting it into my own bo&s;om?</P>
<P>Would it le&s;&s;en your pain then, I replied,
<PB N="103" REF="104">
if I were &s;o in&s;en&s;ible as not to participate in what you &s;uffer for my &s;ake?</P>
<P>'Twas an unguarded que&s;tion; he ca&s;t down his eyes in &s;ilence, and no &s;ooner did I &s;ee the blood mounting in his cheeks, than I felt mine kindle at the recollection of what I &s;aid. In this moment I had no re&s;ource pre&s;ent to my thoughts, but to confe&s;s I had been in tears before I entered his room: my Lord had been chiding me &s;everely; my unhappine&s;s on find|ing my&s;elf the improvident author of his mi&s;|fortunes was great enough without any re|proaches to aggravate it beyond what I could bear. Indeed, indeed, &s;aid I, he is too cruel to me; he oppre&s;&s;es my weak &s;pirits without mercy, and I can no longer &s;upport it.</P>
<P>Reproach me not too &s;eriou&s;ly for this in|di&s;creet confe&s;&s;ion of what I could no longer &s;uppre&s;s, and which nothing but the dilemma I was in could have drawn from my lips: it is too late to recall it, and there is a balm in pity &s;o healing to a wounded mind, that I &s;carce can bring my&s;elf to repent of having thus un|burthened my heart, a&s;&s;ured as I am of the honor and di&s;cretion of this excellent young man. Be&s;ides you will recollect I told you
<PB N="104" REF="105">
we had exchanged a promi&s;e of mutual con|fidence when we conver&s;ed together in the country: he had imparted to me all his feel|ings upon the fir&s;t reception he met with from my Lord; he owned to me that it had given him no flattering impre&s;&s;ions of the comforts of his &s;ituation, and it was plain enough to &s;ee he had already taken a pretty fair mea&s;ure of his Lord&s;hip's character.</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary to relate to you how ten|derly he &s;ympathized in my &s;ufferings; I con|fe&s;s it drew me on to a more explicit di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of all the various particulars of my un|happy &s;tory, as well tho&s;e, which preceded my connection with Lord G. as all that have &s;ince followed. What could I do? was I to blame for giving vent to my &s;orrows, and how can the human heart &s;upport it&s;elf without the con&s;olation of &s;ome friendly &s;pirit to &s;ympa|thize with it in it's &s;ufferings? If indeed I were not of an age &s;o di&s;tant from his, and &s;o far out of all danger or even po&s;&s;ibility of folly, it might be ra&s;h and inexcu&s;able to en|courage &s;uch a connection; but I, who am nearly old enough to be his mother, I, who have neither charms to excite de&s;ires, nor pro|pen&s;ity
<PB N="105" REF="106">
to feel them, what have I to appre|hend either for him or my&s;elf? and why &s;hould I affect to lay my&s;elf under a re&s;traint in his company, which would only &s;erve to expo&s;e my own ridiculous vanity, and give him ju&s;t occa&s;ion to de&s;pi&s;e me for an old coquette? I am determined, therefore, to treat him with that open confidence, which my age and cha|racter may &s;afely commit them&s;elves to with one of his mode&s;ty and merit, and indulge my&s;elf without &s;cruple in that pure and ma|ternal affection, which my heart has truly conceived for him. The&s;e, and only the&s;e, are the &s;en&s;ations which my attachment to this amiable youth in&s;pires me with; and he in re|turn &s;eems to meet me with the mo&s;t &s;piritu|alized and even filial devotion; his attentions to me are of the mo&s;t delicate and re&s;pectful &s;ort; his eyes expre&s;s the milde&s;t benevolence, and every &s;entiment is dictated by a heart re|plete with honor, purity and genero&s;ity; his emotions are &s;uch as can only proceed from a &s;oul warmed by gratitude and melted by pity; &s;urely he is &s;ent to me by the indulgence of Heaven as a kind of guardian &s;pirit to &s;upport and comfort me in this extremity, to fill your

place, my beloved friend, and to &s;upply tho&s;e re&s;ources, of which I am deprived whil&s;t you are at a di&s;tance from me.</P>
<P>When I repeated to him all the cruel things my Lord had &s;aid to me, though I could ea&s;ily di&s;cover the effect they had upon him by the changes which his countenance underwent, &s;till he did not &s;uffer a &s;ingle word of aggra|vation to e&s;cape him, but &s;ugge&s;ted every thing he could devi&s;e that was &s;oothing and conciliatory; ob&s;erving to me that there mu&s;t be a variety of incidents, of which I was not apprized, but to which my Lord by his &s;itua|tion was expo&s;ed, that might ruffle, and di&s;turb his temper; and that allowances &s;hould be made for all men, involved as he was in diffi|cult and intricate affairs&mdash;Perhaps, added he, Lord G. had adopted other thoughts and opi|nions with re&s;pect to Sir George Revel's at|tachment to Lady Loui&s;a than you had, and as his preten&s;ions of a certain &s;ort are as high, as any man's, it is not unlikely but my Lord may be di&s;po&s;ed to his alliance, which indeed in point of policy there can be no objection to, neither is there perhaps any di&s;inclination to be apprehended on the part of the young lady her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="108">There an&s;wered I, you touch upon a point, that gives me very &s;erious alarm, for I can fore&s;ee nothing but inevitable mi&s;ery to my daughter with &s;uch a man, and yet I fear &s;he is attached to him too &s;eriou&s;ly to be diverted from it by any thing I might venture to oppo&s;e in the way of caution&mdash;but alas! what influ|ence have I? or if I had, how dare I to exert it in defiance of my Lord's authority to the contrary?&mdash;And yet can I &s;ubmit to &s;ee my daughter married to the wretch, who villan|ou&s;ly attempted to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate my friend? There is but one way in the nature of things, my dear Mr. Arundel, by which I can in any degree be reconciled to &s;uch a deplorable connection, and that depends altogether upon you. If you can forgive him, if your generous &s;pirit can admit of his atonement, and pa&s;s this action over as the mere action of a mad man with|out premeditation or malice, I could acquie&s;ce with &s;ome patience, e&s;pecially when I reflected that it was the means of re&s;cuing you from further danger, and prevented con&s;equences, that may otherwi&s;e plunge me into mi&s;ery in|&s;upportable, the very thought of which fills my mind with horror.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="109">I cannot doubt but I accompanied the&s;e words with more emotion of voice and utter|ance than I am now aware of, for I perceived they had a very &s;en&s;ible effect upon him: I can recollect that I had his hand in mine, whil&s;t I was delivering them, though I cannot call to mind at what preci&s;e moment, nor ex|actly in what manner I had taken it; I &s;up|po&s;e it was by one of tho&s;e involuntary actions, which e&s;cape us in the ferment of the &s;oul, when it is agitated beyond the powers of recol|lection; but I can well remember that he regarded me with great &s;en&s;ibility and re&s;pect, &s;o that I was under le&s;s alarm on that account, when I recollected the attitude I was in, and therefore thought I would not wound his feel|ings, (which in his weak condition are alive to the &s;malle&s;t tokens of unkindne&s;s) by with|drawing my hand di&s;dainfully and ha&s;tily; on the contrary, ob&s;erving that he was fallen into deep and &s;ilent meditation upon what I had been &s;aying to him, I recalled him to attention by a &s;udden yet gentle compre&s;&s;ure of my &s;in|gers, as if to awaken him, and then demanded&mdash;if he could have the heart to leave me expo&s;ed to all the reproaches of an enraged hu&s;band,
<PB N="109" REF="110">
by pur&s;uing his revenge, in which perhaps he might ru&s;h upon death, and by loading my con&s;cience with his blood, drive me to mad|ne&s;s?</P>
<P>His reply was &s;uch as fills me with alarm: I confe&s;s to you, &s;aid he, that Lord G. has already moved me to an accommodation with Sir George Revel, and offered his mediation for that purpo&s;e. Towards him I found it prudent to ob&s;erve &s;ome fine&s;&s;e, but from you, Madam, I can never hold back any portion of the truth, for you command my heart in every honorable &s;en&s;e of the word. I will not &s;ay that the injury I have received, though as deep as can well be, is &s;uch as ab&s;olutely to preclude accommodation, for I have no thir&s;t for his blood, though it &s;eems he has had for mine; but I mu&s;t fairly confe&s;s I have little expectation that Sir George Revel has mag|nanimity enough to make that ample &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, which may &s;atisfy my honor, nor am I quite a&s;&s;ured that my Lord has all tho&s;e feel|ings for my &s;ituation, which &s;hould urge him to exact a proper and &s;ufficient reparation: be&s;ides this, I have put my&s;elf into the hands of my uncle Sir Francis Arundel, who&s;e re|&s;entment
<PB N="110" REF="111">
on the occa&s;ion runs high, and who&s;e family &s;pirit will not be atoned by common &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Believe me, Madam, I am penetrated to the heart with the words you have now uttered; to defeat the views, which your Lord's ambi|tion may have formed, cannot be indifferent to me, and to deprive the lovely Lady Loui&s;a of the object of her wi&s;hes, (if that object were de&s;erving of her) would be painful in the ex|treme; but what is &s;hocking to my thoughts above mea&s;ure, wor&s;e than death it&s;elf, and more terrible than all things but di&s;honor and the &s;tamp of ignominy upon my name and character, is to feel my&s;elf the author of mi&s;ery and unmerited reproach to the be&s;t and mo&s;t amiable of her &s;ex, to a &s;uffering wife in who&s;e heart unkindne&s;s has already planted its thorns; Oh Lady G. what would I not endure rather than give occa&s;ion of unhappine&s;s and pain to you! Believe me, Madam, I &s;hall carry the impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;entiments, which I feel at this moment, to the late&s;t hour of my life, and &s;o zealous am I to approve the gratitude, the veneration I entertain for you, that there can be no commands of your's, which it is po&s;&s;ible

for me to di&s;obey, but &s;uch as would expo&s;e me to a contempt that would render me un|worthy of a friend&s;hip, which I value above life it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Pity me, my generous, my indulgent friend, pity me, I conjure you, for my conduct at this touching cri&s;is, and condemn me not, if I wanted fortitude to repre&s;s the effu&s;ions of a bur&s;ting heart; I had no longer any command over my tears; they forced their way and fell in &s;howers; exhau&s;ted nature &s;unk under the di&s;charge, and if he had not caught and &s;up|ported me in his arms, I &s;hould have dropt upon the floor. I &s;hudder to think what pain this effort mu&s;t have given to his wound, for when I recovered &s;ight enough to ca&s;t my eyes upon him, he was very pale and as I thought in danger of fainting; my agonies were now all directed to his pre&s;ent danger; I trembled for the mi&s;chief I had done; I even expected to &s;ee the blood &s;tart from his wound and pictured to my&s;elf all the horrors of his immediate death before my eyes: it was too much for human nature to &s;upport&mdash;I know not what I &s;aid; I know not what I did: Na|ture mu&s;t an&s;wer for it; her impul&s;e governed

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. Hon. Mrs. Dormer to the Counte&s;s of G.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT a variety of pa&s;&s;ions hath your let|ter excited in a bo&s;om, which, if time had done its duty, would before this have been deadened and benumbed by years! but it hath been the &s;port, the victim of your pen. Never more will I keep any terms with your unfeeling Lord: when I had &s;eated you in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart, I wi&s;hed to have re&s;erved a corner of it for him; but he is for ever thru&s;t out and excluded; let ambi|tion take him in, he is not fit for the &s;ociety of benevolence; let pride adopt him, let him
<PB N="113" REF="114">
take refuge in his politics; to the angry &s;pirit of party, to the tides and tempe&s;ts of a conten|tious world I turn him over with di&s;dain: whil&s;t he meanly truckles in the pre&s;ence of Princes, he is a mon&s;ter of cruelty in the &s;acred privacy of dome&s;tic virtue. Oh! that you &s;hould be de&s;tined to call him Hu&s;band, and I not per|mitted to regard him as a Friend!</P>
<P>What a contra&s;t have you di&s;played in the picture of that wounded youth! What a revo|lution do you make in the &s;en&s;ations of my heart, when you &s;hift the &s;cene to the chamber of my beloved Arundel! Yes, my gentle friend, I call him my beloved, for I will &s;trug|gle with you, even to animo&s;ity, for &s;ome &s;hare in his regards: what tell you me of being old enough to be his mother? it is no &s;uch thing; but I am more than old enough to be your's, and therefore if age is to be the te&s;t of our pre|ten&s;ions, the prize to &s;truggle for, the plea for friend&s;hip, how much &s;tronger is my claim than your's? Fear me not however; I &s;hall not be formidable to you: <HI>A man may not marry his grandmother</HI>: I &s;hall be contented with a little plain good-will; you are mi&s;tre&s;s of his affections.&mdash;Do not &s;tart, my dear; I
<PB N="114" REF="115">
have not yet &s;aid he is ma&s;ter of your's.&mdash;If Arundel will only hear me talk, it is all I re|quire of him: vanity never totally wears it&s;elf out in old age; it only &s;hifts its ground; mine is as lively as ever, but it has been long &s;ince driven out of the &s;trong po&s;t of beauty, and now maintains a kind of dying combat on the field of under&s;tanding: we chatter non&s;en&s;e all our youth through, and li&s;p out feeble efforts at wit in our old age: now I have a mighty prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that Arundel will allow me all the charms that I have any chance of being flattered for; I intend to make him own that I am a very charming old woman, the be&s;t <HI>tete-&agrave;-tete</HI> in England, and the way, that I &s;hall take to make him &s;o fond of my conver&s;ation, will be by dedicating the whole of it to a de|lineation of your character; yes, my mo&s;t be|loved lady, I &s;hall be your faithful hi&s;torian; I have known you from your cradle, you are all but my own child; the mode&s;t &s;en&s;ibility of your nature, which &s;hrinks back from vul|gar ob&s;ervation, the inborn virtues of your &s;oul, which a hu&s;band's overbearing tyranny awes into &s;ilence and <HI>frights from their propriety,</HI> are all known and familiar to me&mdash;
<Q><PB N="115" REF="116">Set in a note-book, learn'd and cann'd by rote.</Q> And now what think you of your friend and me? Shall not Arundel and I be good compa|ny together?

The hags will have no &s;hare in him; we &s;hall divide him between us; you will po&s;&s;e&s;s his heart, and I &s;hall engro&s;s his ear.</P>
<P>Do you think I do not know to whom I am talking, and of what I am talking? Yes, I am talking of the pure&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, which the human heart can entertain, to a woman of the pure&s;t principles; I am &s;peaking of love to Lady G.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"But love is prohibited to a wife."</Q>&mdash;Did nature make that law? will nature obey that law? Happine&s;s may be prohibited; the light of Heaven may be forbidden; but it mu&s;t be the edict of a tyrant, not the voice of ju&s;tice, which violates the common rights of human kind&mdash;Who gave the heart tho&s;e gene|rous feelings, which an&s;wer to the names of benevolence, &s;ympathy, compa&s;&s;ion, genero&s;i|ty, gratitude and the whole family of human charities? Who, but the &s;ame gracious Being, who, compounding all the&s;e &s;everal qualities
<PB N="116" REF="117">
into one e&s;&s;ence, called it <HI>Love,</HI> and then in|vited all creation to participate of the ble&s;&s;ing? With this cele&s;tial e&s;&s;ence thy clay, my deare&s;t lady, is mo&s;t liberally tempered: to your hu&s;|band you tendered the fir&s;t oblations; he &s;purn|ed them from him, in&s;en&s;ible man! but did he therefore extingui&s;h them? It was not in his power; he cru&s;hed the blo&s;&s;oms but he could not kill the root.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t nobody will tell me that love, though rejected, &s;hall &s;till be love, becau&s;e it is &s;anctified by the rites of marriage: there mu&s;t be &s;ome <HI>mighty conjuration</HI> in tho&s;e rites to overrule the principles of nature before this can be effected. But though this will not bear a di&s;pute, and it mu&s;t be on all hands allowed, that love cannot be called nor re|called by any form of words; yet how many will tell us, that a wife, though &s;he cannot love her hu&s;band, ought not to love any other man? I &s;hall much &s;ooner be brought to confe&s;s the danger of &s;uch love, than the crime of it: But to whom does the danger apply? To the weak, the vain, the unprin|cipled; to them it is danger, not becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;ion, which draws them into danger, is love
<PB N="117" REF="118">
in its true and virtuous character, but becau&s;e it is the counterfeit of love, compo&s;ed of fal&s;e and vicious propen&s;ities: Why then preach to you, who&s;e nature of it&s;elf revolts from all impurity? Is virtue only amiable to us in our own &s;ex? Shall not courage, genero&s;ity and other manly qualities have their claim upon our hearts? Becau&s;e I am wedded to cruelty, &s;hall I love cruelty? &s;hall I not pre|fer and admire the character, where gentle|ne&s;s, benevolence, pity are to be found? and if the&s;e virtuous attributes chance to be in|mates of a heart, which the divine artificer has inclo&s;ed in a fair and comely mould, &s;hall I &s;tart a&s;ide and call it danger, becau&s;e it approaches me in the &s;hape and likene&s;s of a man? No, I will embrace and cheri&s;h it without fear or he&s;itation, convinced that Virtue is of an e&s;&s;ence &s;o &s;piritualized, as not to admit of the di&s;tinctions of either &s;ex or age, and is, wherever it re&s;ides,
<Q>In its own &s;hape how lovely!</Q>

<P>Another word or two, my lovely pupil, by the way of caution&mdash;Do not tell me of your <HI>maternal affection</HI>; there's hypocri&s;y on the face of it; you have no <HI>maternal affection</HI> for Arundel; you can have none. Have not I the reckoning of your age? did not your la&s;t

<P>I will tell you another thing, which per|haps you are not aware of, and this it is&mdash;a very young man, who&s;e ta&s;te is not vitiated by &s;en&s;uality, and who&s;e mind is of the &s;enti|mental

All the world &s;ays, that Sir George Revel was &s;hockingly in fault; but all the world believes I don't think &s;o. You was with me at the Duche&s;s's ball, when I danced with him, and can witne&s;s how con|&s;picuous his attentions were to me: Do I call them <HI>his attentions?</HI> Sir George Revel's &s;elf-pre&s;umption is much too great to de&s;cend to any thing that in the mo&s;t di&s;tant degree can carry an appearance of humility. His own dear per&s;on is the idol of his wor&s;hip, and
<PB N="123" REF="124">
he has made it as rich in gold and precious &s;tones as the Lady of Loretto. He is al&s;o very <HI>fine,</HI> in the fa&s;hionable &s;en&s;e of the word, and very in&s;olent in the plain &s;en&s;e of it. He &s;aid very fine things to me, as he might think them; but as I know they were only &s;aid to di&s;play his own wit and addre&s;s, I cared very little about them. He per&s;uaded him&s;elf he had made a very &s;erious impre&s;&s;ion, and I was &s;en&s;ible he had made a very ridiculous one. My father was well plea&s;ed; for there is every worldly recommendation in the connection. My mother was much di&s;plea&s;ed; for &s;he de|&s;pi&s;es money, and is in&s;en&s;ible to ambition. The re&s;t of the good company, who were uninte|re&s;ted lookers-on, and did not care which way the game went, married us without lo&s;s of time, as the readie&s;t way of di&s;po&s;ing of us.</P>
<P>You your&s;elf, my dear Jane, have been in the general error till this moment, when I de|clare to you from my heart, that I &s;corn and dete&s;t Sir George Revel: I look upon him with horror; I cannot hear his name without &s;huddering; he is the terror of my very dreams; I would &s;ooner leap alive into the
<PB N="124" REF="125">
flames, than marry that mo&s;t hateful of wretches.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, prepare your&s;elf to hear that I am about to do this very thing, &s;o much more terrible than the wor&s;t of tor|ments. Oppo&s;e not that report even with a doubt; give it not &s;o much as a &s;ilent &s;hake of your head when you meet it. Every body knows our intimacy, and if you he&s;itate, my hypocri&s;y will tran&s;pire; the con&s;equence of that will be, that the duel between Sir George and Mr. Arundel mu&s;t take place.</P>
<P>Ah! my dear friend, that fatal week at Spring-grove: how little did I &s;u&s;pect, when my father told us he &s;hould bring down an awkward lad from the univer&s;ity, to be hu|manized in our &s;ociety, that my eyes were to encounter a form, where every grace of mind and per&s;on, every manly charm, every capti|vating talent, unite to conquer. Mr. Arun|del is the &s;on of a younger brother of Sir Francis Arundel, whom all the world knows; his father is in the church, and as his uncle has an heir, this young man has very little el&s;e to look to but his expectations of being pro|vided
<PB N="125" REF="126">
for by my father. He has the charac|ter of being an incomparable &s;cholar, and my mother, who has had much more of his com|pany than I have, is quite charmed with him. I cannot &s;ay that he takes the way of making his court to my father; for he is very high-minded, and won't flatter. The fir&s;t night of his coming we had mu&s;ic; with &s;ome per&s;ua|&s;ion he accompanied me in a concerto: to my a&s;toni&s;hment I heard a perfect ma&s;ter on the violin; and it was a compo&s;ition he could never have &s;een before. His performance charmed me &s;o, that though I was forbidden to &s;ing, I was determined he &s;hould accom|pany me in one of my be&s;t &s;ongs: he did it with &s;uch delicacy of ta&s;te, and &s;upported me with &s;o fine a &s;ymphony, that his tones per|fectly in&s;pired me, and I was never &s;o much in humor with my own voice before. O Nature, had you not done enough, but Art mu&s;t add this accompli&s;hment to make him irre&s;i&s;tible?</P>
<P>When my father went back to town, he left Mr. Arundel with us. It was from thence your haple&s;s friend mu&s;t date her &s;orrows. He was our &s;ole companion; all around us was
<PB N="126" REF="127">
retirement, &s;ilence, tranquillity, and a &s;ea&s;on which con&s;pired with love to a&s;&s;ail my too &s;u&s;|ceptible heart. What qualities, what &s;entiments, what talents, did I then di&s;cover, as his charac|ter unfolded it&s;elf to my ob&s;ervation! He con|ver&s;ed, he read&mdash;Oh Jane, there is the very &s;oul of harmony in his voice. He walked with us, he amu&s;ed us with a thou&s;and various re&s;ources, he in&s;tructed us by a thou&s;and va|rious ways, but with &s;uch mode&s;ty of nature, with &s;o pure a mind, with an under&s;tanding &s;o enlightened, yet &s;o void of pedantry, with manners &s;o refined, and with a countenance&mdash;Oh heavens! <HI>I &s;hall never look upon his like again.</HI></P>
<P>As for me, &s;eeing, as I do, the impa&s;&s;able gulph that is between us, attracted by nature, repelled by fate, I &s;tood gazing like a &s;elf-de|voted victim on the very brink of ruin, mea|&s;uring with my eye the in&s;urmountable barrier that parted us for ever. Sometimes I was de&s;perately impelled to the attempt; to peri&s;h in the gulph, methought, would be a &s;peedier con&s;ummation of my mi&s;ery, than langui&s;hing on the bank till &s;u&s;pen&s;e and di&s;appointment ended me. Sometimes I invoked a nobler re|&s;olution
<PB N="127" REF="128">
to my aid; I took coun&s;el of my pride; I brought into review the nobility of my birth, my rank, my fortune, all the &s;plen|dors of life, that awaited, and even &s;olicited my acceptance. Shall I lower my ambition to take thought of a dependant? &s;hall I de|&s;cend to &s;uch ob&s;curity? Grant for a mo|ment I were abject enough to &s;toop from &s;uch a height to &s;uch a depth, how &s;hould I &s;up|port the terrors of a father's wrath? how &s;hall I face him, who&s;e milde&s;t look never yet re|laxed from its authority, who&s;e very &s;mile awes me into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? I dare not do it; be the con&s;equences what they may, I can die, but I dare not di&s;obey.</P>
<P>Fortified with the&s;e reflections, and made re&s;olute even by my fears, I turned a&s;ide, and &s;ought relief in &s;olitary meditation; I confined my&s;elf to my chamber; I re&s;igned him totally to my mother, who &s;eemed no whit le&s;s ena|moured than my&s;elf, though doubtle&s;s not with my degree of danger, not with my tu|mult of heart; forbid it Heaven! not with my agony of pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;And yet&mdash;what am I &s;aying?&mdash;No, &s;he is all &s;erenity and calmne&s;s&mdash;I am all &s;torm and tempe&s;t; the govern|ment

<P>I'll not look back to what I have written. I am very ill, my dear Jane; read me with pity, not with &s;corn; take me as I am, a creature &s;carce it&s;elf. They tell me I mu&s;t go into the &s;outh of France for the recovery of my health: &s;illy people! what has &s;outh, or north, or any point of the compa&s;s, to do with my health? Can the air of Montpelier breathe peace into my heart? Is forgetful|ne&s;s the growth of France? Can the Alps &s;mother affection? can they &s;creen me from the vi&s;ion of Arundel? Yet I will go into the &s;outh of France; to the farthe&s;t land upon the globe I will gladly go, rather than meet him again.</P>
<P>I never &s;ee him now, though we are under the &s;ame roof; for he is wounded, and I am
<PB N="129" REF="130">
wounded, and neither of us can ri&s;e from our couches. Oh! execrable mon&s;ter, Sir George Revel! The murderer, to &s;trike his &s;word into the brea&s;t of a defencele&s;s man! A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, coward! where was his heart, when he medi|tated the blow? where were his eyes, when he directed it? Could not the radiancy of an angel dazzle him? Could not the expre&s;s image of virtue overawe his impious rage? The guardian &s;pirit of innocence turned a&s;ide the point of his weapon; it glanced upon the &s;ide of Arundel, and blood&mdash;<HI>&s;uch as angels &s;hed</HI>&mdash;followed the &s;troke.</P>
<P>I am ill again; my brain whirls, and I run into mere rhap&s;ody. I have done for the pre&s;ent. My dear Jane, adieu! Love me, &s;pare me, pity me! forget my folly, but re|member my affection. Believe, that whil&s;t I am my&s;elf, I am yours.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI. Lady Loui&s;a G. to Lady Jane S.</HEAD>
<P>SOON after I had clo&s;ed my la&s;t letter, I was &s;eized with a profu&s;e bleeding at the no&s;e: it frightened the&s;e good people, but it relieved me: my head is better, and my thoughts more collected.</P>
<P>There is a negotiation in advance between Mr. Arundel and that wretch; my father is the mediator, and the fir&s;t article of the treaty conditions, that I &s;hall con&s;ent to receive pro|po&s;als from Sir George; for you mu&s;t know <HI>the mon&s;ter is loving,</HI> and will do ju&s;tice, if he is well bribed for it. Is it not an hone&s;t arti|fice to train him on in hope, till he has made atonement for his murderous a&s;&s;ault? Can any thing be a criminal deceit, which &s;aves the life of Arundel? for <HI>the mon&s;ter</HI> is a duel|li&s;t at all points, and loves fighting &s;o well, that he won't wait till his antagoni&s;t is armed, and is particularly re&s;olute with his naked &s;word again&s;t a naked man. Till this mat|ter

<Q>Hide me, ye caverns! cover me, ye Alps!</Q>
Montpelier as well as any other place; any other place as well as Montpelier.</P>
<P>A me&s;&s;age from Arundel by my mother.&mdash;He is &s;hocked to hear I have had &s;o violent a bleeding.&mdash;Yes, Arundel! <HI>I've paid you blood for blood.</HI>&mdash;Your wound is healing, mine rankles at my heart. Poor fellow! he knows it not, he little dreams how mere a murderer he is.&mdash;He recommends a &s;typtic, with which it &s;eems the &s;urgeon &s;topt his bleeding.&mdash;I begged my mother to thank him for his con|cern about me, and a&s;&s;ure him I had a more effectual &s;typtic in re&s;ource. It was an incon|&s;iderate an&s;wer, for my mother took the meaning in&s;tantly, and bur&s;t into tears. Hea|ven pre&s;erve thee, my child, cried &s;he; may I never live to &s;ee thy death!&mdash;and then, thinking to rai&s;e my &s;pirits, &s;he began to talk of Sir George Revel; &s;he flattered her&s;elf all things were now in a fair train to be accom|modated; Mr. Arundel was penetrated with my &s;ituation, and would &s;train every point

with his uncle Sir Francis to acquie&s;ce in the apology: he had even promi&s;ed, if the wor&s;t en&s;ued, that he would never take a life, in which my happine&s;s was intere&s;ted; he would &s;ooner &s;acrifice his own.&mdash;Mi&s;taken, generous man! was this a &s;typtic?&mdash;Yes, it made my blood run back upon my heart.&mdash;At that moment a &s;udden impul&s;e &s;eized me; I for|got my re&s;olution, and would have given worlds to &s;ee him. I thought my mother &s;eemed to under&s;tand my wi&s;h, or perhaps it was her own, for &s;he divides the day between us. I enquired if he was recovering; if he could ri&s;e from his couch without trouble; if he could walk from one room to another: I was then in my dre&s;&s;ing-chamber, for I can|not endure the confinement of my bed. I was &s;itting in my great chair oppo&s;ite to a large gla&s;s that is placed between the windows; I caught a glance of my pallid, faded face; my &s;pirits &s;unk at the &s;ight; I could not bear that he &s;hould &s;ee me &s;uch a &s;pectacle: I &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed the wi&s;h, and &s;aid no more.</P>
<P>My father is almo&s;t frantic with vexation at my illne&s;s; he is indefatigable with Sir George; he has reported the affair to the King, and
<PB N="133" REF="134">
received his Maje&s;ty's command to forbid their proceeding to any further extremities on pain of his di&s;plea&s;ure. I hope this will &s;ilence the old General Sir Francis, and qualify his fiery &s;pirit; he is a mo&s;t profound courtier, and upon the be&s;t terms with my father: he comes frequently to his nephew, but I believe his vi&s;its do not promote his recovery; at lea&s;t my mother is of that opinion.</P>
<P>Alas! my poor mother; &s;he is far from well: my father bears too hard again&s;t her on account of this unhappy rupture with Sir George: I know he has given her very angry words, though &s;he is too con&s;iderate of me to confe&s;s it. Poor Arundel is no le&s;s out of favor with him on the &s;ame &s;core; but as it is his intere&s;t to &s;ooth him at this moment, he affects to &s;hew him much attention.</P>
<P>Farewell, my dear Jane; my &s;pirits are lighter than they were; a gleam of comfort comes over me, and I feel a tranquillity which I have hitherto been a &s;tranger to. Sleep &s;teals upon me: welcome, &s;weet oblivion!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. Lady Loui&s;a G. to Lady Jane S.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER two hours &s;leep in my chair, I awoke with &s;trength and &s;pirits &s;en&s;ibly refre&s;hed. Surely my guardian angel, which had per&s;onated Arundel in my dream, had de|&s;cended upon my heart <HI>with healing on his wings:</HI> &s;o &s;trongly were the form and features of that beloved youth imprinted on my mind's eye, that when I awaked I looked about the room, and hardly could per&s;uade my&s;elf it was illu&s;ion: his voice was yet left in my ear; I li&s;tened, all was &s;ilence; I &s;poke to him; I &s;olicited a reply: it was pa&s;t; reality of hap|pine&s;s is not for me. Oh charming vi&s;ion, how &s;hall I recall thee?</P>
<P>My mother crept &s;oftly into my room, and was overjoyed to find the alteration in my countenance &s;o much for the better: &s;he &s;ays my looks, before I had the bleeding, were &s;o wild and delirious, that they terrified her be|yond mea&s;ure. She don't like to talk of
<PB N="135" REF="136">
Arundel to me, for &s;he believes I am at bit|ter enmity with him on Sir George's account; yet &s;he brought me good news of his reco|very, which &s;he &s;aid was &s;o far advanced, thar he could walk about his chamber with tolerable ea&s;e; that there was to be a meeting of the parties concerned for receiving Sir George Revel's apology; &s;he hoped &s;oon to congratulate me upon all differences being accommodated; but this &s;he believed would depend altogether upon Mr. Arundel's know|ing what my wi&s;hes were in the ca&s;e, and therefore if I had no objection to a &s;hort inter|view with him, &s;he knew he would be very glad to &s;ay a few words to me before the parties met; and in truth, if I found my &s;trength and &s;pirits equal to the ta&s;k, &s;he thought it might be a mutual benefit to both parties, and prevent any further effu&s;ion of blood.</P>
<P>Oh my dear Jane, what a trepidation &s;eized my heart at this moment! The vi&s;ion of Arundel was about to be realized. I took &s;ome time to recover my&s;elf; and the better to divert my mother's attention from the agitation I was in, pretended to adju&s;t &s;ome
<PB N="136" REF="137">
little articles of my dre&s;s, (my face was not now &s;o pale and languid as it was when I looked la&s;t in the gla&s;s) and having &s;ettled a few other preliminaries, which female vanity cannot di&s;pen&s;e with, I de&s;ired her Lady&s;hip to &s;ignify to Mr. Arundel that I expected the fa|vor of his vi&s;it.</P>
<P>She accompanied him to my door but no further: the moment was too much for me; I was alone with Arundel; the beloved image I had &s;een in my dream, who&s;e words yet mur|mured in my ears, who&s;e tender care&s;&s;es &s;till impre&s;&s;ed a melting &s;oftne&s;s on my &s;oul, was now in per&s;on before me, and the &s;hadow was converted into &s;ub&s;tance. I &s;unk back in my chair; he &s;prung to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and, gently taking my hand in his, demanded if he &s;hould call Lady G. to me: to this I replied&mdash;By no means; pray, &s;it down, Mr. Arundel, and do not be alarmed for me: I have been a good deal weakened by the lo&s;s of blood; we are fellow-&s;ufferers in that particular; but I am in all other re&s;pects much better than I have been; I think my&s;elf greatly recovered within the&s;e few hours.</P>
<P>I am overjoyed to hear it; but if the honor
<PB N="137" REF="138">
you have now indulged me in is to co&s;t you any &s;ufferings by the exertion it occa&s;ions, I &s;hall never forgive my&s;elf for having made the reque&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall proceed to give you the &s;ub&s;tance of our dialogue, and leave it with you to a&s;&s;ign the parts to their re&s;pective performers.</P>
<P>Mr. Arundel, I reque&s;t you will con&s;ider your own &s;ituation, and place your&s;elf as much at your ea&s;e, as if I was not pre&s;ent. It is very flattering that you &s;hould wi&s;h to come to me, as I am &s;ure your motives cannot but be kind and friendly. If one of us is to &s;uffer by the exertion this occa&s;ions, I am much afraid the misfortune will be your's, for I &s;u&s;pect your good-will to me may have brought you out of your chamber too &s;oon for your &s;afety.</P>
<P>When I am in your &s;ervice, Madam, it is not po&s;&s;ible for me to think of danger:&mdash;What I wi&s;h to have now the honor of &s;aying to you will I hope be under&s;tood by you as dictated by the &s;incere&s;t re&s;pect; if I &s;eem guilty of any pre&s;umption in reque&s;ting this interview, I be&s;eech you to believe it can only &s;pring from the intere&s;t I pre&s;ume to take in your happine&s;s. I need not tell your Lady&s;hip that
<PB N="138" REF="139">
the inconvenience I &s;uffer at pre&s;ent is the ef|fect of an accident, which took place in con|&s;equence of a certain mi&s;under&s;tanding that originated at Spring Grove. Accidents of this &s;ort are &s;o ea&s;ily &s;ettled, that there would not be the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for the meeting which Lord G. has appointed here this day, neither &s;hould I con&s;ent to be pre&s;ent at it, if I were not given to under&s;tand that your Lady&s;hip has &s;omething more than general wi&s;hes for an amicable termination of all differences.</P>
<P>I have indeed, Mr. Arundel, very earne&s;t, very anxious ones.</P>
<P>You will &s;top me if I proceed too far, but I wi&s;h to make my&s;elf correctly under&s;tood, without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on your delicacy: I mu&s;t beg to be more particular&mdash;I have been told you are intere&s;ted in the con&s;equences that may en&s;ue&mdash;</P>
<P>Heaven only knows how much.</P>
<P>Indeed! that's &s;trong&mdash;but I re&s;pect your &s;incerity. I am then to conclude, Lady Loui|&s;a, from what you have been plea&s;ed to tell me, that were I to pur&s;ue my re&s;entment again&s;t Sir George Revel to the extremity, which would naturally re&s;ult from &s;uch tran&s;actions as have pa&s;&s;ed between him and me, I &s;hould

put a life to hazard, that is dear and valuable to you.</P>
<P>Mr. Arundel, I will not forfeit the &s;incerity you are plea&s;ed to commend in me; I confe&s;s you would put a life to hazard, was you to meet Sir George Revel in the field, that is dear to me.</P>
<P>It is enough, Madam! I am &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Dear to me beyond expre&s;&s;ion, valuable above all earthly con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>I am fully &s;atisfied: all my re&s;entments, however ju&s;t and natural, are for ever buried in my bo&s;om; there they &s;hall &s;ub&s;ide, nor ever endanger the happy object, you have ho|nored with you love. Oh! that he may prove worthy of his happine&s;s!&mdash;I now for the fir&s;t time very &s;incerely rejoice that I was not armed when he attacked me, that I had no &s;word in my hand to return that death upon him, which he aimed at me.</P>
<P>Had you but &s;een his countenance whil&s;t he &s;poke the&s;e words!&mdash;Where was his intelli|gence, that he failed of applying to him&s;elf tho&s;e equivocal an&s;wers I gave? Where was my re&s;olution, that I did not boldly turn upon him tho&s;e awakening words&mdash;<HI>Thou art the</HI>

<HI>man?</HI> Generous Arundel, dull only to thine own merits, blind only to a partiality in thine own favor, which in no other ca&s;e could have e&s;caped thy notice!</P>
<P>He made a pau&s;e and ca&s;t his eyes upon me with &s;o penetrating a look, that I apprehended he had made a very intere&s;ting di&s;covery, and was &s;o thoroughly aba&s;hed that I could not utter a word in reply to the very generous &s;peech he had made me: he certainly perceiv|ed my embara&s;&s;ment, though I had &s;oon rea|&s;on to know he had not interpreted it truly, for he proceeded as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P>What honor I may leave behind me in this affair I cannot pretend to &s;ay, but I &s;hall have to reflect it is for your &s;ake I am &s;acrificed, and that reflection will heal every wound. I can break off from the world without regret, the &s;hort acquaintance I have made with it will not co&s;t me many &s;ighs to renounce; and there are opportunities enough for my choice, where I may have a chance at lea&s;t of recovering my lo&s;t honor.</P>
<P>Good Heavens! Mr. Arundel, what can you mean? what de&s;peration is in your mind? You alarm me.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="142">Heaven forbid I &s;hould alarm you! Be a&s;|&s;ured, Lady Loui&s;a, that whil&s;t you are the protectre&s;s of Sir George Revel, he is in the &s;anctuary of an altar, that I cannot violate. Let him devote to gratitude the life you give him; let him dedicate it to tho&s;e pure and de|licate attentions, which may con&s;titute your happine&s;s: if in any future time it &s;hould come to pa&s;s that to the injuries he has done to me he ba&s;ely adds an injury to his benefactre&s;s, in that moment my &s;word &s;hall find him out, and the vengeance, now &s;mothered, bur&s;t with double ju&s;tice on his head.</P>
<P>Oh Jane! I am undone in his opinion; I &s;uffered him to continue in his ignorance, nay I had not power to undeceive him, though I had been ever &s;o willing, for I was now in no condition to reply: the tears &s;tarted from my eyes; I trembled with agitation, I hid my face with my handkerchief, and threw my&s;elf back in my chair.</P>

<P><PB N="142" REF="143">I a&s;&s;ured him it was not &s;o; on the contrary I had heard nothing from him but what did honor to his &s;entiments; perhaps, added I, you have mi&s;taken me in &s;ome particulars, but time will clear up all things; to that I mu&s;t refer you, and by that I tru&s;t I &s;hall be ju&s;tified in your opinion.</P>
<P>I hope, he replied, your Lady&s;hip does not &s;u&s;pect me capable of &s;o much pre&s;umption as to form opinions for or again&s;t any re&s;olutions you may think fit to adopt; I &s;hould be of all men mo&s;t impertinent were I to intere&s;t my&s;elf in any predilections of Lady Loui&s;a's, further than to follow her choice with my good wi&s;hes, wherever it may lead me; but though I cannot prevent tho&s;e wi&s;hes from &s;pringing in my mind, I can and will prevent their e&s;|caping from my lips, and I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you that not a &s;yllable of what has now pa&s;&s;ed &s;hall ever tran&s;pire from me. I am now go|ing to receive Sir George Revel's apology, totally indifferent as to what it may be, deter|mined only to extricate your mind from its anxiety on his account.</P>
<P>And can you not &s;uppo&s;e that I am an ene|my to duels upon general as well as particular motives? is there any thing in nature &s;o bar|barous
<PB N="143" REF="144">
and &s;avage, &s;o oppo&s;ite to every prin|ciple of ju&s;tice, humanity and religion?

When you kindly inve&s;t me with a power over your re&s;entments, by which I can prevent the effu&s;ion of human blood, would it not be criminal in the extreme if I neglected to exert it? A&s;&s;uredly it would; and therefore, Mr. Arundel, I repeat to you my mo&s;t earne&s;t entreaties to accept of the atonement, which Sir George Revel is prepar|ed to offer, by doing which you will relieve me from un&s;peakable agonies, and re&s;tore me to my health and &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Is there any thing, exclaimed he, I would not do or &s;uffer in &s;uch a cau&s;e? From this moment Sir George Revel and I have no quarrel; and that we never may in time to come, it &s;hall be my concern to provide again&s;t all chances of our ever meeting again: &s;o I do but hear that you are happy, I cannot be an enemy to the man, who makes you &s;o.</P>
<P>So &s;aying he di&s;appeared, and left me to re|flect

upon the <HI>pious fraud</HI> I had been practi|&s;ing; my thoughts fluctuated alternately from pain to plea&s;ure without ob&s;erving any regular and determinate cour&s;e; I accu&s;ed my&s;elf for &s;uffering him to depart under an impre&s;&s;ion, that mu&s;t degrade me in his opinion; but of this I &s;oon acquitted my&s;elf by reflecting that but for this impo&s;ition, there would have been no po&s;&s;ibility of preventing the duel, and I took credit for having now done as great a violence to my feelings for his &s;afety, as he had done to his honor for my repo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII. Counte&s;s of G. to the Hon. Mrs. Dormer.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>YOUR letter, my dear friend, alarmed me. Is my heart better known to you than to my&s;elf? Am I in this danger and not con&s;cious of it? am I in love with Arundel?</P>
<P>It is time indeed to recollect my&s;elf. Where am I? On a precipice&mdash;and yet methinks, if this were &s;o, your friendly voice would call me back, not urge me forward, as you now &s;eem to do. Had I indeed de&s;cended into the vale of years, where life's pa&s;&s;age becomes &s;mooth and even, and where no rocks nor precipices ob&s;truct the traveller, &s;till &s;ome prudence would be nece&s;&s;ary to avoid the traps and pits that folly digs even in that level path: but if I have only turned the &s;ummit of the hill and am not yet landed at the bottom of it, &s;hould not I, who a&s;cended with credit, be cautious to de&s;cend without di&s;grace?</P>
<P>Surely then you treat me either with too much confidence or with too little care.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="147">Your letter is a dangerous letter for a wife to read, who&s;e mind is actuated by re&s;entment on one hand and by love on the other. You have not only &s;tudied the French writers &s;o clo&s;ely, but lived &s;o long in their country, that methinks you are become a kind of advocate for their matrimonial &s;y&s;tem, and plead for the propen&s;ities of woman's frail nature with as much ingenious &s;ophi&s;try and as little &s;olid ar|gument as the be&s;t of them.</P>
<P>Will you believe me when I tell you I did not &s;ee Arundel for &s;ix hours after I had read your letter? I pa&s;&s;ed that day in reviewing and examining the &s;tate of my heart, and I began to flatter my&s;elf into a per&s;ua&s;ion that you had decreed wrongfully again&s;t it. I found a thou&s;and natural excu&s;es for the weakne&s;s I had given way to, when I had my fir&s;t inter|view with Arundel after his wound; I was then exhau&s;ted and afflicted by the reproaches of Lord G.; Loui&s;a's illne&s;s kept my &s;pirits in continual alarm; and the &s;pectacle which Arundel pre&s;ented to my &s;ight was peculiarly affecting. In this manner I accounted with my&s;elf for the little command I had over my feelings at a certain cri&s;is, which I was firmly per&s;uaded would not happen any more.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148">Elated with the i&s;&s;ue of this &s;elf-examination, I took up your letter with an air of &s;atisfac|tion, and gave it a more attentive peru&s;al than before, when I had read it with timidity and a certain con&s;cious reproach.</P>
<P>It &s;oothed my agitated &s;pirits, it lulled them into &s;ecurity; And what is this fear-created phantom, &s;aid I within my&s;elf, which I have rai&s;ed up to alarm me? why &s;hould I not in|dulge this plea&s;ing partiality for a de&s;erving object? and though I may no longer call it a <HI>maternal affection,</HI> yet I have the authority of a judicious friend and the te&s;timony of a clear con&s;cience for pronouncing it to be an inno|cent one.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t break off, as Arundel has de|&s;ired to &s;ee my daughter, if her health permits, before the parties meet for &s;ettling this affair with Sir George Revel. Loui&s;a has had a long &s;leep and waked much refre&s;hed by it; &s;he con&s;ents to &s;ee him; I will continue my letter when their interview is over.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>Arundel is now in conference with Loui&s;a. To what purpo&s;e &s;hall I any longer keep up a re&s;erve and di&s;&s;emble with my own heart?
<PB N="148" REF="149">
why &s;hould I di&s;gui&s;e from you the plea&s;ure I received in the few moments I have now pa&s;&s;ed with Arundel after the long intermi&s;&s;ion, which my &s;cruples had impo&s;ed upon me? The very &s;ight of him put all remon&s;trances to flight and &s;ilenced my inquietude. Nothing &s;o gentle can be dangerous; there was a temperate dignity in his looks, that would have a&s;&s;ured the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious, encouraged the mo&s;t timorous. He is the very &s;oul of honor; and if it is your plea&s;ure to call my virtuous attachment by the name of Love, love let it be!&mdash;&s;o long as vir|tue is annexed to it and you approve, what &s;hall I fear? I wait his return with impatience.</P>
<P>In the mean time let me reveal to you the very inmo&s;t movements of my heart.&mdash;You chided me for affecting to &s;helter my&s;elf un|der the privileges of age, and at the &s;ame time reminded me of a certain date; which I con|fe&s;s does not remove me far beyond the con|fines of youth. I own to you I am flattered by your reproof, and not very much out of humour with my looking-gla&s;s for depo&s;ing to the truth of your calculation: neglected by my hu&s;band and ca&s;t off from his attentions, I had cea&s;ed to con&s;ult it with any &s;atisfaction; but
<PB N="149" REF="150">
now, &s;ince I have perceived new pa&s;&s;ions &s;pringing in my heart, and have your privi|lege for indulging them, I &s;urvey my&s;elf with con&s;cious plea&s;ure, and am glad to di&s;cover, that, though mother to a full-grown daughter, I have not quite made over my whole &s;tock of attractions, but kept a re&s;idue to animate the cold re&s;pects of friend&s;hip, and in&s;pire the &s;en&s;itive bo&s;om of youth with tho&s;e &s;oft and intere&s;ting emotions, which quicken all the &s;prings of affection without di&s;turbing the re|po&s;e of virtue.</P>
<P>Like a reclaimed &s;pendthrift, I am now ma|naging the remains of a dimini&s;hed property with more oeconomy and care than ever I be|&s;towed upon the entire &s;tock; and I can per|ceive that beauty, among&s;t many properties which have led us to compare it to a flower, hath this in common with all the deciduous tribe, that though its principal di&s;play of vege|tation is in the &s;pring, yet its energy is &s;till re&s;erved for what is called its <HI>mid&s;ummer-&s;hoot.</HI></P>
<P>Alas for me! you can witne&s;s what a joyle&s;s &s;pring mine was; how little did he, to whom my bloom was dedicated, prize what he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed! and now from being carele&s;s, he is
<PB N="150" REF="151">
become moro&s;e: but let me not complain; and you, my friend, you mu&s;t not be too exact in &s;hewing me all my injuries: the honor of a wife, when depending on no other &s;tay but that of duty, is like a ve&s;&s;el riding at her &s;ingle anchor, which in a &s;mooth &s;ea may hold; but, if a &s;torm a&s;&s;ails her, is but a precarious &s;afe|guard from its fury.</P>
<P>Arundel is now advancing fa&s;t in his reco|very, and my Lord, who&s;e great ambition is to call an unprincipled a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;on-in-law, la|bours hard for peace: the va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Sir George Revel, not forgetting the weight of his parliamentary intere&s;t, are merits &s;uf|ficient, in his Lord&s;hip's balance, to make his &s;cale preponderate; and my poor girl, who&s;e rea&s;on &s;eems no le&s;s debilitated than her con|&s;titution by a round of plea&s;urable di&s;&s;ipation, is as eager as her father to &s;natch the glitter|ing bait, in&s;en&s;ible to the fatal, the envenomed hook, which is lurking under it. In the mean time I, who am a mere negative being, with|out influence and without effort, am fallen under my Lord's mo&s;t unju&s;t &s;u&s;picion as be|ing a medler in his mea&s;ures, and indu&s;trious to prejudice my daughter's mind again&s;t the
<PB N="151" REF="152">
projected alliance with Sir George: truth is my witne&s;s, that &s;ince the fatal affair at Spring-grove, I have never once ventured upon the &s;ubject with Loui&s;a, nor is it likely that I ever &s;hall. Though I have more than once made the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions to my Lord, I &s;u&s;pect they have gained no great belief; for I am &s;traitly watched, and enquiries never fail to be made how often I have been with my daughter, how long I &s;taid with her, and what pa&s;&s;ed between us; &s;o that I attend upon her no more than my duty naturally requires of me, and on tho&s;e occa&s;ions am extremely guarded how I betray the lea&s;t di&s;like of her connection with Sir George.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;carded as I am from any intere&s;t or authority in the concerns of my own family, under the di&s;plea&s;ure of my hu&s;band, and up|on re&s;erve with my daughter, my &s;ole re|&s;ource is in the &s;ociety of Arundel. With him I &s;it, by his tender attentions I am re|conciled to my &s;ituation, and for the time for|get how truly in&s;ignificant I am become to all the world but him: he &s;ees how totally I de|pend upon him; and I cannot doubt but my eyes, which dwell with &s;uch delight upon
<PB N="152" REF="153">
his countenance, have told him to conviction how devotedly my heart adores him. Fami|liarized to each other, he no longer treats me with that form and di&s;tance which rank exacts from our inferiors on a fir&s;t acquaintance: &s;till he is the only man I ever met, who knows how to be familiar with elegance, tender with re|&s;pect, and perfectly at ea&s;e without one trace of unpolitene&s;s. Good manners &s;eem in him con&s;titutionally inherent, for they are never out of &s;ight a &s;ingle in&s;tant: and through all the little &s;ervices, which my a&s;&s;iduity to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his painful &s;ituation is for ever offer|ing him, not a touch, a look, a word beyond the limits of a mode&s;t though affectionate re|&s;pect have I once experienced from him. This gives me a &s;ecurity in his di&s;cretion; and now that I have gained a confidence in my&s;elf from the encouraging explanation in your letter, I have a privilege for indulging all tho&s;e tender propen&s;ities, which impel my heart towards the mo&s;t amiable of mankind, and make the moments that I pa&s;s with Arundel &s;o inno|cently charming. With joy I have di&s;cover|ed his approaches advance &s;tep for &s;tep with mine; he now takes my hand in his, looks
<PB N="153" REF="154">
fondly in my eyes, as they are either &s;uffu&s;ed with tears of pity for the pain he &s;uffers, or brightened by the &s;mile of gratitude and love, whil&s;t he comforts me in my misfortunes, and in the accents of an angel coun&s;els me with the wi&s;dom of one. In the&s;e happy moments I have &s;een the ri&s;ing colour over&s;pread his cheeks, his breath fluttering, and his eyes fixed ardently upon mine: believe me, my beloved friend, <HI>there is no terror in tho&s;e looks</HI>; his bo&s;om is the repo&s;itory of honor, his heart is tender, but it is pure withal; there is a dig|nity in his nature, an inherent power within him that keeps tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o rebellious in &s;ome brea&s;ts, under perfect controul in his: 'tis then I truly venerate his character; 'tis then I pay the tribute due to his exalted merit; 'tis then I let him &s;ee without re&s;erve how much I love and honor him.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV. Counte&s;s of G. to the Hon. Mrs. Dormer.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD &s;carce &s;ealed my la&s;t letter when Loui&s;a &s;ent to &s;ay &s;he was alone, and wi&s;hed to &s;ee me. Mr. Arundel had ju&s;t left her; it was plain &s;he had been in tears, and her &s;pirits &s;eemed extremely fluttered: &s;he told me that the conver&s;ation had been very intere&s;ting: he had promi&s;ed her to accept of Sir George Revel's apology, &s;o that to-morrow it is to be hoped will &s;ettle this untoward affair. By the joy which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed on this account, and the gratitude &s;he &s;eemed to bear to Arundel for complying with her reque&s;t, I am afraid in is too clear that &s;he is decidedly attached to Sir George; but as I am determined not to meddle in an affair, which my Lord takes &s;o exclu&s;ively upon him&s;elf, I was careful to avoid the &s;ubject, and &s;he did not incline to open her&s;elf to me of her own accord. I was &s;orry to hear her &s;ay that this amiable young man
<PB N="155" REF="156">
is &s;o much hurt by the proceeding, and has put &s;uch a force upon his feelings by acquie&s;|cing in the propo&s;ed apology, that he will quit our family and &s;trike into another line of life, though it is what I expected from his &s;pirit. I mu&s;t do Loui&s;a the ju&s;tice to confe&s;s, that &s;he appeared no le&s;s penetrated than my|&s;elf by this intelligence, and &s;he was earne&s;t with me to try all my influence for di&s;&s;uading him from the mea&s;ure: &s;he thinks he hinted at the army, and as he is now upon terms with his uncle, the General, this is not unlikely; if my Lord does not with&s;tand this by all means in his power, or at lea&s;t if he lets him go without &s;ome effectual mark of his favor, I &s;hall think it mo&s;t ungenerous behavior.</P>
<P>From her chamber I pa&s;&s;ed to Arundel's; there I found him alone in a very melancholy &s;tate of mind; it was evident &s;omething had pa&s;&s;ed of an unplea&s;ant &s;ort, of which I made no enquiries, but &s;at down clo&s;e to the couch, on which he had repo&s;ed him&s;elf: he &s;eemed exhau&s;ted and in pain; I took his hand in mine, and was beginning to count his pul&s;e, when he withdrew it gently from me, and, with a look of inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;oftne&s;s, &s;aid&mdash;Why are you thus anxious about an in&s;ignificant being,
<PB N="156" REF="157">
whom to-morrow you will be a&s;hamed to ac|knowledge? Lady Loui&s;a is incurably at|tached to Sir George Revel, and I am too con&s;iderate of her repo&s;e, alarming as her &s;i|tuation &s;eems to be, not to &s;acrifice my re|&s;entment at her de&s;ire. When I reflect that your feeling heart will be relieved by the &s;ame event, that gives ea&s;e to hers, how can I repent of my promi&s;e? but indeed this ta&s;k has been a hard one, and unle&s;s I had felt for your re&s;pon&s;ibility in this affair, all that man can feel for woman, I could never have brought my &s;pirit to &s;ubmit to it.</P>
<P>He turned his eyes upon me with a mo&s;t touching expre&s;&s;ion; there was a wearine&s;s and languor in his look that melted me to pity; I could not an&s;wer him. He put his hand to his &s;ide, as if his wound &s;eemed to pain him; I thought his po&s;ture was unea&s;y and I de&s;ired he would &s;uffer me to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in arranging it; for this purpo&s;e I pa&s;&s;ed my arm under his neck to rai&s;e his head from the couch, and whil&s;t I was &s;upporting it in this manner, he turned his face towards me, and my cheek dropt in&s;tinctively upon his. What a tremor then ran to my heart! he mu&s;t have
<PB N="157" REF="158">
felt its tumult; his own, mean time, appa|rently enjoyed no greater quiet, for his breath fluttered, and his whole frame was agitated. He took his hand from his &s;ide, and pa&s;&s;ing it round my wai&s;t, &s;trained me to him with a gentle pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he held me thus in his embrace, I &s;aid to him in a whi&s;per&mdash;Oh, Arundel, let this virtuous endearment be the &s;acred &s;eal of our friend&s;hip! the love I bear you is as pure as your own unblemi&s;hed honor; re|proach me not for my indi&s;cretion, if I now give way to the tenderne&s;s that overflows my heart, but regard me as a grateful creature, who owes every thing to your kindne&s;s, and who would be mi&s;erable in the extreme, if your pity did not chear her.</P>
<P>Oh! what mu&s;t be the man, cried he, who is in&s;en&s;ible to this excellence, to the&s;e charms?</P>
<P>As he uttered the&s;e concluding words he dropt his head upon my &s;houlder, and pre&s;|&s;ing me more clo&s;ely to him eagerly exclaim|ed&mdash;Save me, my deare&s;t lady, &s;ave your&s;elf! then extricating him&s;elf from the &s;ituation we were in, he took both my hands in his, and

rai&s;ing them devoutly to his lips&mdash;Go, cried he, mo&s;t amiable of women, for the love of Heaven be gone, before I forfeit your e&s;teem for ever.</P>
<P>Now what do you think of your pro&s;elyte? Had Arundel been as well tutored in your pre|cepts as I am, what would now have been my &s;ituation? O treacherous precepts, to what perils have you expo&s;ed me!</P>

Our good King, God ble&s;s him! is a good man, and very con&s;iderate, as his Lord&s;hip gravely told us, of his &s;ubjects lives and limbs; but I cannot help thinking, in all due deference, that he will cruelly mi&s;pend his pains, if he &s;uffers him&s;elf thus to be drawn out as middle man in every hot-headed brawl that is &s;tarted in his kingdom.</P>
<P>A notable wi&s;e ju&s;tice of peace, whom I knew in our county, u&s;ed to compo&s;e &s;quabbles between his neighbours by telling the parties at a word, that if they could not &s;ettle their dif|ferences on the &s;pot, to betake them&s;elves to the ring in his court-yard, and fight it fairly out; but if they were willing to agree, let them go down to his cellar, and &s;hake hands over a tankard.</P>
<P>Something of this &s;ort might pa&s;s at our cabinet for what I know; a board of French

And now my Lord made a kind of farewell &s;peech to the court, in which his Maje&s;ty was again remembered with all due reverence, and &s;omething very prettily brought in about the calumet of peace, to our great edification; the apologizing Baronet made his bow, I &s;hook my friendly officers by the hand; and &s;o, my dear Charles, there is an end of the matter&mdash;

<P>Here is a melancholy ca&s;e in point for your argument again&s;t duelling. I never &s;aw my cou&s;in but once in my life; he was a fine per|&s;onable young man, but had an air of uncom|mon ferocity and haughtine&s;s, and &s;eemed very ambitious of being employed in my affair, but by no means in a pacific capacity. I whi&s;pered one of the officers, and found he was informed of the event; he &s;aid the de|cea&s;ed was clearly in the fault, and that it was a very frivolous affair about a com|mon woman. I find my&s;elf able to be car|ried

<P>As there is no doubt but this compromi&s;e of ours will &s;oon bring about a marriage between Lady Loui&s;a and Sir George, this hou&s;e will no longer be an agreeable re&s;idence for me; nor can I think of keeping up any connection with the father-in-law of &s;uch an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; for to &s;ay the truth, my dear Charles&mdash;

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI. Arundel to Charles Mortlake.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE been carried to my uncle's hou&s;e, and bore the motion of the chair much bet|ter than I expected.</P>
<P>Poor man! this misfortune has broke him down: I never &s;aw a greater &s;pectacle of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">&s;e</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165">Is it an ob&s;ervation founded in truth, that the&s;e high &s;pirits &s;ink under their &s;orrows more than men of ordinary pa&s;&s;ions? I am apt to think mo&s;t extremes in nature are nearer to each other than we are aware of; at lea&s;t they &s;eem to hold a very good corre|&s;pondence together, though they re&s;ide at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Our meeting was very di&s;tre&s;sful: he threw his arms round my neck and gave vent to the vehemence of his grief: &s;trong gu&s;ts of tears and heavy &s;ighs by turns broke from him, and at intervals his face &s;eemed to &s;uffer a kind of convul&s;ive twitching, that looked very alarming.</P>
<P>He eagerly demanded if my affair was com|promi&s;ed, and when I a&s;&s;ured him it was, he cried out,&mdash;I thank God for it! two victims to that cur&s;ed practice of duelling would be too many for one morning, and for one &s;ad heart to &s;urvive. You &s;ee me here, nephew, a mi&s;erable man, at the end of life bereft of my only child, who has &s;acrificed him&s;elf to a fa&s;hion, to a freak, to the &s;tart of a moment; he is taken from me in the prime of his days,
<PB N="165" REF="166">
unprepared for death, in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion, upon a fooli&s;h quarrel for a worthle&s;s trollop: What will become of me, if you do not &s;up|port me in my affliction and fill up the place of a &s;on?</P>
<P>You will naturally &s;uppo&s;e I &s;aid every thing on this melancholy occa&s;ion, which my heart could &s;ugge&s;t for his &s;atisfaction and relief.</P>
<P>Yes, nephew, continued he, you mu&s;t be now my Francis Arundel, my &s;on, my &s;ole &s;upport. Be kind to me, be an ho|nor to the name you bear, and take example by the fate of your unhappy cou&s;in. I feel &s;ome awkward &s;ymptoms, which convince me there is no time to be lo&s;t in making my|&s;elf ready for my call: I have &s;ent for my lawyer and &s;hall not &s;leep till I have put the la&s;t hand and &s;eal to my will. You are the only Arundel of the generation under me now remaining of our branch; you are therefore my natural heir, and as &s;uch I &s;hall in&s;tantly adopt you. Your uncle John, who is now at &s;ea, has ever been a kind and loving brother to me; he is a noble, gallant fellow and an

Of your father you mu&s;t forgive me if I do not &s;peak.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for the cau&s;e, I replied, and I wi&s;h it was in my power to be a mediator; but I tru&s;t that time and milder &s;entiments on both &s;ides will effect that reconciliation which I have not the pre&s;ent pre&s;umption to under|take. I hope, notwith&s;tanding, that you will allow me to inform my father in general terms of all which this fatal morning has pro|duced, &s;o far at lea&s;t as it affects me.</P>
<P>Do as you like, cried he, do as you like in that particular, but do not talk to me about it; I will have no concern or corre|&s;pondence with him. As for my&s;elf, I can|not expect to la&s;t long, and probably &s;hall give you the &s;lip upon very &s;hort notice; therefore, my dear boy, as we have been too long e&s;tranged from each other, let me hope we &s;hall not be &s;eparated for the remainder of my

days; and as your fortune now places you far above dependance, I &s;uppo&s;e you will not he|&s;itate at detaching your&s;elf from your pre&s;ent &s;ituation with Lord G.</P>
<P>To this I &s;trove to make a &s;uitable and be|coming reply, acknowledging my obligations for the bounty he intended to be&s;tow on me in grateful terms, without running into any ful&s;ome prote&s;tations: I &s;aid I was both ready and de&s;irous of attaching my&s;elf entirely to his per&s;on and &s;ervice from henceforth, and I hoped the period of our acquaintance to come would be much longer than he &s;eemed to ex|pect. With re&s;pect to Lord G. I had &s;uch &s;trong rea&s;ons to wi&s;h my&s;elf out of his fa|mily, that I &s;hould obey his commands with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, and would &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity for taking leave of his Lord&s;hip and all further connections with him.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity for that, &s;aid my uncle; for though you will find your&s;elf in affluence, you may avail your&s;elf of Lord G.'s introduc|tion for becoming a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, by which you may be an active and u&s;eful member of the community; and this leads me to remind
<PB N="168" REF="169">
you, that by the fatal event of this morning there is a vacancy in my borough, and as I believe you are ju&s;t of age to take you &s;eat, I propo&s;e, with your good liking, to bring you into parliament.</P>
<P>I will not take up your attention, I re|plied, at this time, by giving you all my motives for wi&s;hing to detach my&s;elf from the politics and connections of Lord G.; I flatter my&s;elf they are &s;uch as you will not condemn me for: and in the &s;ame &s;pirit of independence you will allow me to declare, before you take any &s;tep for bringing me into parliament, that I &s;hould hold my&s;elf as a traitor to my country and a di&s;grace to your name, if I could con&s;ent to enter upon that tru&s;t, but as a free and unbia&s;&s;ed member, not wedded to any party or opinion, no follower of Lord G. nay permit me to add, and be not offended at my plainne&s;s, not even of you my benefactor.</P>
<P>A gleam of joy &s;parkled in his eyes as I &s;aid this; he ro&s;e from his &s;eat, took me cor|dially by the hand and immediately cried out&mdash;That's right, my good boy! I &s;ee you are a true Arundel; henceforth you are my &s;on.
<PB N="169" REF="170">
&mdash;The gleam was momentary; his features fell, convul&s;ion &s;hook his face&mdash;Ah me! he cried, and &s;unk again into his chair, cover|ing his cheeks with both hands, as if to &s;top their motion, or at lea&s;t conceal it from my notice.</P>
<P>It was a piteous &s;ight and affected me ex|tremely. I thought it was be&s;t not to take notice to him of the di&s;order he was too vi&s;ibly in, and therefore to divert his attention I began to tell him of the match Lord G. was making for his daughter with Sir George Revel, at the &s;ame time ob&s;erving to him that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to be cordial with the father-in-law of a wretch, who in the mo&s;t di&s;honorable manner had attempted my life; for though it was true I had made peace with him, I was determined never to make acquaintance either with him or his con|nections.</P>
<P>Well, well, &s;aid my uncle, take your own mea&s;ures and be your own ma&s;ter in all re|&s;pects: it was &s;o I treated my poor unfor|tunate &s;on, and &s;o I &s;hall treat you. I de&s;ire you will command in this hou&s;e, for I &s;hall no
<PB N="170" REF="171">
more concern my&s;elf with the affairs of this world, when I have once completed the deed that is to put you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; it is fit that I, who am ha&s;tening out of life, &s;hould retire from trouble. If you are determined to have no further connection with Lord G. I do not wi&s;h to enquire into your rea&s;ons; &s;o long as you adopt them I am di&s;po&s;ed to think them ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Here his &s;ervant came to announce the lawyer's arrival; upon which he de&s;ired me to return to Lord G. and communicate to him as much as I thought fit of my affairs, and as &s;oon as my health permitted to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hou&s;e, where he &s;hould give orders for my reception. Con&s;ult your &s;urgeon how|ever, added he, and do nothing ra&s;hly to en|danger your health.</P>
<P>Here we parted: and thus have I given you the particulars of a &s;udden and extraordinary revolution in my fortune, which changes the whole &s;y&s;tem of my life and opens a new pro|&s;pect, flattering indeed to my ambition, but awful to a mind which fore&s;ees the trials it has to undergo, and trembles for the re&s;pon&s;ibility

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII. Arundel to the Rev. Dr. Arundel</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE the painful ta&s;k of informing you, that Sir Francis Arundel had this morning the melancholy account of his &s;on's being killed in a duel. I have vi&s;ited him in con&s;e|quence of his misfortune, and am &s;orry to add that the violence of his grief &s;eems to threaten him with very alarming &s;ymptoms. I &s;ubmit to you whether it may not be advi&s;eable to make a journey to town upon this occa&s;ion: I will flatter my&s;elf that grief will not lo&s;e its property in his in&s;tance, nor fail to &s;often the a&s;perity of his mind towards a brother, who&s;e nature I am a&s;&s;ured is thoroughly di&s;po&s;ed to peace and reconciliation: no efforts on my part &s;hall be omitted to prepare my uncle's heart with tho&s;e healing impre&s;&s;ions which

<P>Sir Francis has been plea&s;ed to &s;ignify his intention of making me his heir, and propo&s;es my immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the vacancy in his borough, which the unhappy event of this day has occa&s;ioned. The&s;e favors have been accompanied with a reque&s;t, that I will live with him in future, which will of cour&s;e incapacitate me from any longer attendance upon Lord G. The&s;e commands I am now preparing to obey, and &s;hall very &s;oon take leave of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I have been &s;ome time confined by an acci|dental hurt upon one of my ribs, but am &s;o well recovered of it, that I expect in a few days to be out again. I hope you continue to enjoy your health; that you long may is the &s;incere prayer of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII. Dr. Arundel to Francis Arundel.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT may be tho&s;e properties of grief, which you are &s;o well acquainted with, I am not &s;tudious to learn, nor over-eager to experience; if you mean me to believe that grief will melt the marble of your uncle's heart, they mu&s;t be miraculous properties in|deed, and a great deal more than I &s;hall put my tru&s;t in. As for a journey to London upon the mere expectation of &s;eeing this mighty miracle performed upon your uncle, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I do not hold it quire &s;o advi&s;eable as you &s;eem to think it; nor is it altogether &s;o ea&s;y and perfunctory a matter for me to undertake at my time of life, per|&s;waded moreover as I am, that <HI>miracles have cea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>I am obliged to you for the offer of your intere&s;t with Sir Francis in the way of recon|cilement;
<PB N="174" REF="175">
but are you &s;ure I &s;eek that recon|cilement? are you &s;o well &s;atisfied with your own great powers of per&s;ua&s;ion, that you can by the charms of your rhetoric <HI>convert the hard rock into the &s;pringing well?</HI> Is there no deli|cacy previou&s;ly to be ob&s;erved towards my honor, which perhaps may not willingly con|de&s;cend to owe that reconcilement to the in|fluence of a third per&s;on, which my own me|rits could not command? You may inherit your uncle's property, Mr. Arundel, but I envy you it not, if you take his pride into the bargain, and with it any portion of that in|&s;en&s;ibility towards my feelings, which with his other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;eems in this in&s;tance to have devolved upon you.</P>
<P>Though you may in time be found the heir of his e&s;tate, remember at the &s;ame moment I, if living, am the heir of his title. Where is the provi&s;ion to &s;upport it? Am I to crouch to you, like the de&s;cendants of the aged <HI>Eli</HI> to the child Samuel, <HI>for a piece of &s;il|ver and a mor&s;el of bread</HI>; and &s;hall I &s;ay, like them, <HI>Put me I pray thee into one of the prie&s;ts offices, that I may eat a piece of bread?</HI> No,
<PB N="175" REF="176">
Sir, I am a <HI>prie&s;t</HI> already, and have ju&s;t enough to purcha&s;e that poor diet without your help; and Sir Jo&s;eph Arundel (if ever that &s;hall be my title) &s;hall &s;till toil on in the humble office of a pari&s;h prie&s;t, nor crouch for a &s;ingle mor&s;el of tho&s;e rich endowments, which have pa&s;&s;ed over his hoary hairs to fall upon the giddy head of youth.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t revoke that word, when you take your &s;eat among&s;t the &s;enators and elders of the &s;tate. Happy nation, to be &s;o wi&s;ely governed, and thrice happy con&s;tituents, who are to con&s;ign their intere&s;ts to &s;o grave, &s;o competent, &s;o experienced a repre&s;entative!</P>
<P>You are plea&s;ed to tell me that your uncle has de&s;ired you to live with him, and aban|don the &s;ituation in which my intere&s;t placed you with a noble and powerful patron: and you have obeyed <HI>his commands</HI>; obeyed them without reference to me; joined with my wor&s;t enemy, de&s;erted my be&s;t friend, and this by the <HI>commands</HI> of your uncle! If my <HI>commands</HI> go for nothing, might you not have paid &s;ome little attention to my wi&s;hes? Might you not have &s;topt to hear them, to

<P>You &s;ay you have been confined by an <HI>ac|cidental hurt upon one of your ribs</HI>; my informa|tion is that you have been fighting a duel; you can be&s;t tell which is the truth. You may have had your uncle's <HI>commands</HI> for this al&s;o; he has been <HI>a man of war from his youth,</HI> and dearly he abides the pa&s;&s;ion he has always had for blood: the judgment has fallen upon his own hou&s;e; <HI>he that &s;miles with the &s;word &s;hall peri&s;h by the &s;word.</HI> In this, as in the relin|qui&s;hment of your patron, you have not waited even for my <HI>wi&s;hes</HI>; for it is not likely that I &s;hould recommend a practice, which though &s;tamped with the &s;pecious name of ho|nor, violates the laws of God as well as man. If then I am founded in my fact, and this hurt on your ribs, which you lightly term <HI>acci|dental,</HI> is in truth a wound you have received from the &s;word of a duelli&s;t, I can only re|mark, that you have taken a very convenient way of throwing your faults upon chance;

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. Lady Loui&s;a G. to Lady Jane S.</HEAD>
<P>I Have now the happine&s;s to inform my dear Jane, that this horrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e is over, and Mr. Arundel has accepted Sir George Revel's apology. But think not that my fears are over, my &s;orrows at re&s;t; no, they are of the Hydra generation, and &s;eem even to multiply by amputation. In the fir&s;t place, my impa|tient father has opened upon me already, and in this &s;tile he has di&s;cour&s;ed&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, Loui&s;a, I have at la&s;t brought this young man of our's to rea&s;on; our friend Sir George Revel has conde&s;cended to make him a very hand&s;ome apology, and he with a great deal of very haughty indifference has conde|&s;cended to accept of it. I believe in my con|&s;cience
<PB N="178" REF="179">
the fellow's head is turned by the &s;itua|tion I have rai&s;ed him to; but I &s;hall take his pride down a peg or two before long.</P>
<P>I have never been able to di&s;cover any pride in Mr. Arundel.</P>
<P>Pooh! what &s;ignifies whether you have di&s;|covered it or not? I tell you the&s;e academics, when they have &s;tuffed a little Greek and Latin under their caps, are as vain as peacocks; but I &s;hall pluck &s;ome of his fine feathers, I can tell him. It will be &s;ome years before I &s;hall &s;tand in need of the father's &s;ervices again, and it will not be much &s;ooner that the &s;on will ever be the better for mine.</P>
<P>That mu&s;t be as your Lord&s;hip plea&s;es: but &s;uppo&s;e we chu&s;e &s;ome &s;ubject more agreeable to talk upon.</P>
<P>Well recollected, my dear! and what &s;ubject can be more agreeable, than the affair we have in view re&s;pecting Sir George Revel? You &s;ee what a fine gallant fellow he is, elegant in his figure, manners and addre&s;s; quite a man of the world, a fini&s;hed gentleman; travelled, &s;peaks the languages, dre&s;&s;es well, entertains well, dances well; gives the fa&s;hion, &s;plendid in his equipage, wor&s;hipt by all the fine women
<PB N="179" REF="180">
about town, and inconte&s;tably the fir&s;t match in point of fortune now in the kingdom.</P>
<P>I am told indeed he is very rich.</P>
<P>Rich, child! there is no end to his property in land and money: then his boroughs&mdash;I ve|rily believe he has intere&s;t, if well managed, to command eight votes in Parliament at the lowe&s;t computation. Sir George Revel's poli|tical weight is, exclu&s;ive of all other con&s;idera|tions, a very great thing: hitherto it has been thrown into the oppo&s;ing &s;cale, and if he and his members had not very hand&s;omely &s;eceded from the divi&s;ion of ye&s;terday, we of the Mi|ni&s;try &s;hould have lo&s;t the que&s;tion, &s;o nearly were we balanced. The&s;e, Loui&s;a, are only the fir&s;t fruits of his attachment; the pro&s;pect of an alliance with my family has already made him neutral, there only wants another &s;tep to convert him into a friend. You &s;ee, my dear, how the father is indebted to the daughter's charms; and therefore, taking all the&s;e con&s;i|derations into my view, I find &s;o many things con&s;pire to recommend him to my good liking, that, high as I hold your preten&s;ions, I not only give you my con&s;ent to pur&s;ue your inclinations by marrying Sir George Revel,
<PB N="180" REF="181">
but mu&s;t fairly confe&s;s it is become the warme&s;t wi&s;h of my heart that you &s;hould do &s;o.</P>
<P>Being ill prepared on the &s;udden to evade this pointed attack, I very imprudently an|&s;wered that I believed my mother did not think &s;o favorably of Sir George Revel as his Lord&s;hip did.</P>
<P>Your mother think! cried he, &s;tarting up in a rage&mdash;your mother think not &s;o favorably of Sir George! what right has &s;he to think at all about him? Do you &s;uppo&s;e your mother's opinions are to weigh with me? Who is your mother, that &s;he &s;hould think for me, and who am I? Did I rai&s;e the daughter of a plain country gentleman to the rank of a Counte&s;s, to fill her head with notions that &s;he is to direct the intere&s;ts, the alliances of my family? I &s;hall &s;oon teach her a better under&s;tanding of her duty; and I de&s;ire you will not pay the lea&s;t regard to what &s;he thinks in disfavor of Sir George Revel, when I peremptorily and definitively declare for him.</P>
<P>I was now &s;o much alarmed for the mi&s;chief I had done, and for the &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion and reproach, which I had unadvi&s;edly drawn down upon my poor &s;uffering mother, that I was de|bating
<PB N="181" REF="182">
with my&s;elf in what words to declare to him my own fixt and determined aver&s;ion from the match he propo&s;ed; but his looks were &s;o furious, that they frightened me from my pur|po&s;e, and I did not venture upon any thing more than to be&s;eech him in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner not to let my mother &s;uffer his di&s;|plea&s;ure for what I had &s;aid: I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ur|ed him &s;he had never &s;poke a word in Sir George's di&s;prai&s;e, &s;ince his Lord&s;hip's anger about the affair at Spring Grove; on the con|trary I prote&s;ted, and I with truth, that &s;he had always held a language entirely conformable to his Lord&s;hip's wi&s;hes, ever &s;ince &s;he had known what tho&s;e wi&s;hes were; and that it would make me the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of beings to bring trouble and reproach upon her, only becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he po&s;&s;ibly might not have altered her opinion of the man, though &s;he had changed her way of &s;peaking of him.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce patience to hear me thus far, when he cut me &s;hort, and in a tone very little &s;oftened by all I had been &s;aying, thus re|&s;umed his invectives&mdash;I know what your mo|ther has done, full well, and I know what &s;he is now doing; caballing with that Arundel

again&s;t me and Sir George Revel: I &s;hould not have been at all &s;urpri&s;ed if &s;he had gone the length of pre&s;&s;ing him into the duel, had not the cha&s;ti&s;ement he has already met with cooled his courage: Was ever &s;uch an affront offered to a man of Sir George's &s;ort? was ever &s;uch an in&s;olent me&s;&s;age &s;ent by &s;uch an in&s;o|&s;olent me&s;&s;enger? Thank my &s;tars, he has &s;marted for it; he has been pretty well puni&s;h|ed, and had not he &s;topt where he did, he would have been completely provided for; but Sir George's life was of too much con&s;e|quence to be pitted again&s;t a beggar. I will keep no &s;uch fellow in my family, warm no &s;uch &s;nake in my bo&s;om; though he is a wounded one, he is venomous, and I will di&s;|patch him. Let us &s;end this in&s;tant for your mother and her accomplice into the room, and you &s;hall hear me give him his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion be|fore her face.</P>
<P>He was actually going in his rage to ring the bell, when I ju&s;t &s;ummoned &s;trength of voice enough to cry out&mdash;For Heaven's &s;ake, my Lord! &s;top your hand! my &s;pirits are &s;o exhau&s;ted, that if you proceed any further, I &s;hall faint. He pau&s;ed, looked at me, &s;aw the

Alas, madam! I have un|de&s;ignedly &s;et my father in a rage again&s;t you; my heart bleeds for you; oh! that I might die and be no longer the unhappy cau&s;e of all your &s;ufferings!&mdash;My dear, dear child, &s;aid &s;he, be under no pain about me: your father's rage has no longer any terrors; I &s;hall meet it with perfect compo&s;ure.&mdash;I &s;carce know what followed; after &s;ome time &s;he left me to the care of my woman, and went out of the room in tears.</P>
<P>Strengthen my brain, kind Heaven! it is very weak; it &s;hakes, it wanders: &s;upport it, I implore thee, in that moment, when to the face of my enraged father I &s;hall re&s;olutely de|nounce &s;corn and rejection to that wretch Sir George, and vindicate an unoffending, injured mother.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX. The Hon. Mrs. Dormer to the Counte&s;s of G.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are not half &s;o angry with me as I am with my&s;elf for writing you &s;o incon|&s;iderate a letter. The &s;ubject &s;eized me in an unfortunate moment; you know the warmth of my re&s;entments, and can make &s;ome allow|ances for an imagination at all times perhaps too volatile, but, when heated by &s;uch indig|nities as your unfeeling Lord had ca&s;t upon the favorite of my heart, not likely to be re|&s;trained within the bounds of prudence.</P>
<P>I am a fooli&s;h old woman, who am apt to &s;peak what I think, and write as I feel; I am therefore always employed with my friends and corre&s;pondents either in committing errors or atoning for them. Your conduct has been &s;o uniform, that I have fallen into fewer &s;crapes of this &s;ort with you than any body el&s;e; you are not familiar with my ab&s;urdities, and there|fore it was, that this appeared &s;o great to you;
<PB N="185" REF="186">
&s;ome of my more experienced intimates would only have &s;aid&mdash;<HI>This is &s;o like Dormer</HI>&mdash;and thought no more of it.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know in the fir&s;t place, I am in love with Arundel my&s;elf;&mdash;in the next place, I am furious again&s;t Lord G.&mdash;But no more of this folly; I am relap&s;ing into it again.</P>
<P>Now if I had ever learnt <HI>the art to blot,</HI> I would &s;trike out this non&s;en&s;ical paragraph; but I go beyond Ben Jon&s;on in my love of Shake&s;pear, for I do not &s;top <HI>on this &s;ide of idolatry;</HI> I idolize even his errors, and like Alexander's wry-necked courtiers, copy the inaccuracy, becau&s;e I cannot reach the &s;ubli|mity, of his genius.</P>
<P>Do you think I have lived &s;ingle all my days only becau&s;e I could not find a hu&s;band? No, my dear Lady, <HI>in good Queen Be&s;s's golden days,</HI> or &s;omething later perhaps, I made &s;ome noi&s;e in the world and had offers in plenty, &s;ome tolerable, &s;ome intolerable; but, as Arun|del was not then born, and I could find no man entirely to my mind, I knew my temper too well to tru&s;t it to any one man's keeping for life, when it could hardly hold out for a day. There were two things my &s;pirit was
<PB N="186" REF="187">
never proof again&s;t; it could re&s;i&s;t neither kindne&s;s nor unkindne&s;s; therefore I argued with my&s;elf thus&mdash;As it is the nature of tho&s;e in&s;idious animals called lovers to be mo&s;t al|luringly <HI>kind,</HI> and as it has &s;ometimes happened that tho&s;e tire&s;ome creatures called hu&s;bands will be mo&s;t provokingly <HI>unkind,</HI> I &s;hall infal|libly pa&s;s my&s;elf over from one to the other and probably forget to carry my reputation with me; for this rea&s;on I thought it be&s;t to have nothing to &s;ay to either one or the other, and thus it has come to pa&s;s that with &s;ome hard &s;truggles, and now and then a hair-breadth e&s;cape, with a great deal of rea&s;oning and a good deal of repugnance, here I am at your command as veritable an old maid as mo&s;t are at &s;eventy years end: how much longer I &s;hall hold out in this humour I will not pretend to &s;ay, for I am coming up to London in all my charms, and if my &s;pectacles &s;hould have the property of Archimedes's gla&s;&s;es, and &s;et the tender heart of Arundel on fire, it is all over with me; I &s;hall be found in the likene&s;s of Hogarth's old bride at the altar; I may as well &s;tep into the frame at once and take my po&s;t in the print-&s;hops, for every body will know me.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188">And now to be &s;erious.&mdash;The conclu&s;ion of your interview with Arundel threw me into a trembling: much as I love tender &s;cenes, I do not wi&s;h my real friends to be the per|formers of them. It is too like vaulting on the rope, a pa&s;time I was never fond of; a fal&s;e &s;tep breaks the vaulter's neck: thank the fates, you are fairly on your feet again! We old go&s;&s;ips, in whom <HI>the heyday of the blood</HI> is over, do as much mi&s;chief with our prattle, as trumpeters in a battle by their clamour, when they &s;et folks a fighting, and them&s;elves keep clear of the fray.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be heartily glad to hear that Arundel is well of his wound, and that wicked couch out of his chamber; it will not then be incum|bent upon you to nur&s;e him any longer: there is not a more tickli&s;h office in nature than to be &s;ettling and arranging a young man's po&s;|ture on the&s;e charitable occa&s;ions, and adju&s;t|ing his head upon a pillow, when he cannot do it for him&s;elf; I would as &s;oon handle a wounded wa&s;p; they &s;eem dying, but they have &s;trength to &s;ting.</P>
<P>I remember to have been in the &s;ame pre|dicament with a lover of my own near a cen|tury
<PB N="188" REF="189">
ago; the poor man had been in the hun|dreds of E&s;&s;ex, where he had caught the <HI>mala|die du pays,</HI> and was chattering and &s;hivering in as compleat an ague-fit as ever came out of the fens: my fooli&s;h pity per&s;waded me to vi&s;it him; I thought I could not have done it at a le&s;s dangerous moment; he was as unpro|mi&s;ing and harmle&s;s a lover as you ever be|held; for my part I thought him dying, and began to be &s;o full of commi&s;eration and kind|ne&s;s that I charmed away his ague &s;o effectually that I was very near conjuring up a wor&s;e enemy in its place. In &s;hort, my dear Lady, I learnt enough by the danger I e&s;caped never to go a nur&s;ing &s;ick lovers any more.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI. The Counte&s;s of G. to the Hon. Mrs. Dormer.</HEAD>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to be angry with you long, becau&s;e you will not let me be &s;erious; yet &s;erious I mu&s;t &s;trive to be, for I have a melan|choly matter to relate.</P>
<P>My Lord and I are upon the point of &s;epa|ration; I have had an interview with him, of which I mu&s;t give you the particulars; as it is probably the la&s;t I &s;hall have to relate, you will be more ready to excu&s;e the length and dullne&s;s of the relation.</P>
<P>My dear Loui&s;a had rather unadvi&s;edly let fall a hint to his Lord&s;hip that I was not of the &s;ame way of thinking with him&s;elf in regard to Sir George Revel: this made him furious, and all &s;he could &s;ay to allay his anger, and con|vince him that I had not practi&s;ed upon her mind, was to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In this temper I found him alone in his dre&s;&s;ing-room, when he in&s;tantly welcomed me with the en&s;uing &s;alutation:&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="191">By what right, Madam, do you pre&s;ume to oppo&s;e my authority in this family? How is it that you take upon your&s;elf, knowing as you do that Sir George Revel has my approbation and full con&s;ent to marry my daughter, how is it I &s;ay that you take upon your&s;elf to hinder and ob&s;truct that match, by &s;eizing every &s;ecret, underhand opportunity of decrying that gen|tleman's character and per&s;on in her hearing? I would have you know, Madam, that the&s;e in&s;idious practices again&s;t me &s;hall no longer be put up with: I will not &s;acrifice my daugh|ter's intere&s;t and happine&s;s to your whim and caprice; nor, becau&s;e a paltry College-boy, whom I have too good-naturedly received as a dependant into my hou&s;e and family, has been in&s;tigated to affront a man of fortune and fa&s;hion, and been properly cha&s;ti&s;ed for it, will I &s;uffer him to carry on a cabal under my very roof, and effect that revenge by &s;ecret means, which he wanted &s;pirit to pur&s;ue in a more open manner.</P>
<P>Here his pa&s;&s;ion coming to a &s;top, I calmly an&s;wered&mdash;</P>
<P>If your Lord&s;hip is now at lei&s;ure to hear my an&s;wer, I will make it; but if you have
<PB N="191" REF="192">
any more charges again&s;t me, I will wait your time, and then reply to the whole.</P>
<P>I could perceive the firm and deliberate manner in which I addre&s;t him, was what he did not expect; he pretended however to pa&s;s it off with a contemptuous &s;neer, and told me I might do as I liked; whether I an&s;wered him or an&s;wered him not was of very little con&s;e|quence; he had made up his mind.</P>
<P>If your Lord&s;hip has made up your mind again&s;t conviction, I replied, there is indeed but little u&s;e in my &s;peaking at all; but if there are &s;uch things as truth and honor in exi&s;tence, I call them to witne&s;s that I have never once oppo&s;ed your wi&s;hes for an alliance with Sir George Revel, &s;ince the affair at your villa, for which I underwent your di&s;plea&s;ure &s;o &s;e|verely: I repeat to you, my Lord, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that I have never in&s;inuated to Loui&s;a, even in the mo&s;t di&s;tant degree, any thing to that gentleman's di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Then pray, Madam, what is your opinion of that gentleman; I de&s;ire to know your real &s;entiments of Sir George Revel.</P>
<P>No, my Lord; there you mu&s;t excu&s;e me; I have &s;trictly done my duty in not oppo&s;ing
<PB N="192" REF="193">
the per&s;on you approve of; but &s;o long as my thoughts do not offend again&s;t your com|mands, I conceive I have a right to keep them within my own brea&s;t, and it mu&s;t be &s;omething more than inqui&s;itorial torture that &s;hall force them from me.</P>
<P>Upon my word you are grown very lofty on a &s;udden; but as I know your thoughts full well there needs no inqui&s;ition to extort them from you: yes, Madam, I know your thoughts and I know your coun&s;els; I know your en|mity again&s;t Sir George, and I know the fo|menter of that enmity. A dependant I can ea&s;ily di&s;mi&s;s out of my &s;ight; but I would have you al&s;o to know, Lady G. that I will not &s;uffer even a wife to remain under this roof, who is &s;ecretly plotting with an up&s;tart crea|ture of her own training to poi&s;on the affec|tions and counteract the welfare of my daugh|ter, in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential concern of her life.</P>
<P>My Lord G. when you are plea&s;ed to di&s;mi&s;s me from this roof, you will add very little aggravation to the cruelty I have too often experienced under it.</P>
<P>Then leave it to-day, to-morrow, the next day&mdash;as &s;oon as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194">Where is it your plea&s;ure that I &s;hould go?</P>
<P>I care not; any where but to Spring Grove. And for Mr. Arundel, your confidante, I de&s;ire you will be pre&s;ent, whil&s;t I give him his di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion&mdash;Having &s;o &s;aid he rung the bell, and a &s;ervant attending, bade him tell Mr. Arun|del, if he was able to leave his chamber, he de&s;ired to &s;ee him immediately. As &s;oon as the &s;ervant was gone, he &s;aid to me, I de&s;ire, Lady G. you will not leave the room. I made no reply, and a &s;ilence en&s;ued till Mr. Arun|del entered, leaning on the &s;ervant's arm.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething awful in the human countenance, where courage and integrity re|&s;ide; but when the&s;e virtues are &s;et off with manly beauty, &s;uch as Arundel di&s;played upon his entrance, the &s;welling heart of pride will &s;hrink before it, and the tyrant feel him&s;elf a coward.</P>
<P>It was evidently &s;o with my in&s;ulting Lord, who&s;e &s;torm, &s;o loud before a woman, lowered it&s;elf into a &s;mall, &s;till voice, which opened with an apology for bringing him out of his chamber, when the motion &s;eemed &s;o painful to him.</P>
<P>My Lord, replied Arundel, I mu&s;t be much
<PB N="194" REF="195">
wor&s;e before I &s;hould excu&s;e my&s;elf from obeying your commands.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip was hampered, and I dare &s;ay heartily repented of his undertaking, but his dread of betraying him&s;elf in my pre&s;ence, pu&s;hed him on the &s;tage and he began very lamely to open the &s;cene, as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Arundel, I have a negotiation now go|ing on in my family, in which Sir George Re|vel is a party very intimately concerned; and though peace is now e&s;tabli&s;hed between you, yet, con&s;idering all that has pa&s;&s;ed, I think your longer re&s;idence in this family can neither be agreeable to your&s;elf, nor altogether conve|nient to Sir George or me.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip judges with great delicacy of my feelings, as far as your motives for wi&s;h|ing my departure ari&s;e from your con&s;ideration for me only: but, my Lord, from the urgen|cy of your me&s;&s;age, and the&s;e commands fol|lowing &s;o clo&s;e upon my acquie&s;cence in Sir George's apology, I &s;hould pre&s;ume you have other motives more pre&s;&s;ing than my conve|nience, which now induce you to lay tho&s;e commands upon me.</P>
<P>I told you &s;o, Sir; I gave you other rea&s;ons;
<PB N="195" REF="196">
I &s;aid it would not be agreeable nor conveni|ent to Sir George.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay it would not, my Lord; but give me leave to a&s;k if there was not another per|&s;on named, for who&s;e approbation I have much more deference than for Sir George's.</P>
<P>Yes, I do not deny it, I did &s;ay, and I &s;ay it again, that it will not be &s;uitable or agreea|ble to me.</P>
<P>I humbly thank your Lord&s;hip for this early proof of your &s;incerity; but I mu&s;t al&s;o appeal to your ju&s;tice; and, as it is known to my friends that I have had the honor of being admitted into your Lord&s;hip's family, I beg to know whether I have your leave and com|mi&s;&s;ion to tell them that I go out of it with equal honor.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not commit my rea&s;ons to your re|port, Sir, I &s;hall give them my&s;elf to your fa|ther and your uncle Sir Francis, which are all the friends of your's that I am acquainted with. As for you, I have only to recommend it to you to return back to your &s;tudies at Cambridge and pur&s;ue a line of life that you are more fit for. It is not for a dependant to enter into cabals again&s;t his patron's connec|tions
<PB N="196" REF="197">
and interfere in the concerns of the noble family he is allowed to live in; the prudence and circum&s;pection nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch a &s;tation your books it &s;eems have not in&s;tructed you in, and nothing but experience of the world can teach. The &s;ituation I had intended to place you in, is a po&s;t of confidence and private tru&s;t; it is through your own fault that the&s;e kind intentions do not take place, and it would be only leading you into di&s;appointments, if I were to let you build any hopes of favor or promotion from me.</P>
<P>I watched the countenance of Arundel, whil&s;t this was pa&s;&s;ing, and &s;aw his eyes &s;parkle with fire at &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions that touched him, and need not be pointed out to your notice: the &s;truggle he had within him|&s;elf to repre&s;s his immediate re&s;entment was apparent, but after a &s;hort pau&s;e, when my Lord had done &s;peaking, he made him this reply:</P>
<P>My Lord, I relinqui&s;h all hopes of favor or promotion from you without &s;uffering the lea&s;t di&s;appointment, and &s;hould chearfully quit a &s;ituation, which is now become incompatible with my pre&s;ent views in life, if it was not ac|companied
<PB N="197" REF="198">
with a charge again&s;t my character of a very &s;erious nature, and which I am very &s;ure I do not de&s;erve from your Lord&s;hip: you accu&s;e me of entering into cabals again&s;t your connections, and interfering in the con|cerns of your family. What connections of your's have I caballed again&s;t? What family concerns have I interfered in? I am intitled to my defence, my Lord, and therefore I de|&s;ire you will &s;tate my guilt.</P>
<P>The connection I allude to, Sir, is that which I have in contemplation to enter into with Sir George Revel; that as I take it is a very &s;erious concern; and I have too good grounds for belief, not to be warranted in &s;ay|ing that you have been very ho&s;tile to Sir George; nay that you are &s;o &s;till, and have taken every means in your power, jointly with the Lady pre&s;ent, to rai&s;e prejudices again&s;t him in that bo&s;om where lea&s;t of all they ought to take place.</P>
<P>I &s;hall an&s;wer very plainly to every part of your Lord&s;hip's charge; and fir&s;t, that I have been ho&s;tile to Sir George Revel. It is &s;ome|thing extraordinary, when your Lord&s;hip &s;ees me here before you carrying the marks of that
<PB N="198" REF="199">
man's brutal attack upon me, at a time I had no arms to defend my&s;elf with, that you accu&s;e me of ho&s;tility; e&s;pecially when I have re|frained from taking either per&s;onal or legal vengeance for the injury. My Lord, when I called upon Sir George Revel to explain &s;ome very in&s;olent expre&s;&s;ions he had treated me with under the protection of your roof, I went to him in a peaceable manner, in my riding dre&s;s, as I had di&s;mounted from my hor&s;e, without any weapon whatever; and this I did from delicacy to his &s;ituation, knowing he was then upon guard, and for the very purpo&s;e that he might not be tempted to a violation of his duty, or my&s;elf expo&s;ed to the imputation of provoking an officer under tho&s;e re&s;trictions by the ho&s;tility of my appearance, had I gone armed to the meeting. Was this a &s;ymptom of enmity? or is this wound, which &s;till di&s;|ables me, the proof on which your Lord&s;hip grounds your charge? Is the i&s;&s;ue of this morning's meeting, at which you your&s;elf conde&s;cended to be pre&s;ent, any mark of a re&s;entful, ho&s;tile &s;pirit in me? A man indeed may pardon through fear what his heart would prompt him to re&s;ent; but as I will not &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="199" REF="200">
your Lord&s;hip means to impute my ac|quie&s;cence in Sir George's apology to cowar|dice, I do not &s;ee how you can with any ju&s;tice derive an act of forgivene&s;s from a &s;pirit of enmity.</P>
<P>The &s;econd part of your charge is that I am &s;till ho&s;tile to this gentleman: My Lord, if I am to regard Sir George Revel as one whom you are di&s;po&s;ed to honor by your alli|ance, I &s;hall not &s;o far forget the re&s;pect due to your Lord&s;hip as to &s;ay any thing more in your pre&s;ence, than &s;imply to a&s;&s;ure you, that, without bearing any ho&s;tility to him, I have no de&s;ire of any acquaintance with him.</P>
<P>The la&s;t and mo&s;t &s;erious part of your Lord|&s;hip's charge again&s;t me, is that I have endea|voured to &s;ow prejudices in that bo&s;om, which I join with you in thinking ought to be kept &s;acred, and which I do from my heart both hope and believe is truly &s;acred, not only from the taint you allude to, but from all others of whatever de&s;cription. No, my Lord, this charge I deny in the mo&s;t peremptory manner; and whoever dared to abu&s;e your ear with the ba&s;e in&s;inuation, is as fal&s;e as hell it&s;elf can make a human creature. I have
<PB N="200" REF="201">
not that meddling nature in me, neither have I pre&s;umption to arrogate to my&s;elf any in|fluence over the Lady I am accu&s;ed of having tampered with. Once, and only once, I have had the honor of &s;eeing her &s;ince I received my wound, and tho&s;e few minutes, &s;he will bear me witne&s;s, were otherwi&s;e employed than in prejudicing her mind again&s;t Sir George Revel. It was becau&s;e I would not point my &s;word again&s;t the man on whom her future happine&s;s may probably depend, that in tho&s;e few minutes I gave up a re&s;entment, which, with &s;hame I confe&s;s it, years would not el&s;e have extingui&s;hed. I can only &s;ay, I could have wi&s;hed you to hear this from Lady Loui&s;a rather than from me; but the inju&s;tice of your accu&s;ation mu&s;t be the apology for my vanity.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tre&s;pa&s;s on your Lord&s;hip's patience with one word or two more. There is a lady pre&s;ent, whom you have thought fit to a&s;&s;o|ciate with me in this part of your charge: I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, my Lord, when you honor me with &s;uch an a&s;&s;ociate, you cannot mean to couple guilt with purity; that would be a mo&s;t unnatural league indeed, a guilty man
<PB N="201" REF="202">
with the mo&s;t perfect of her &s;ex, an incendiary in your family with her who is the ble&s;&s;ing of it. Here then, my Lord, I offer no defence, for joined with Lady G. I can commit no crime; nor does your Lord&s;hip, when you bring her virtues into the &s;ame a&s;&s;ociation, mean to impute any to me; I receive it as an acquittal of the whole, as the highe&s;t honor you can confer upon me, and am infinitely bound to you for it.</P>
<P>You are very ingenious, truly, Sir, and have given me a &s;ufficient &s;pecimen of the logic of your &s;chools; but I have heard enough of it, and do not wi&s;h you to put your imagination to any further efforts. I &s;hall write to your father, and as your uncle is my very good friend, I mean to call upon him very &s;hortly. At pre&s;ent you will excu&s;e me, as I have rather more important bu&s;ine&s;s on my hands, than to li&s;ten to your rhap&s;odies.</P>
<P>Mr. Arundel upon this ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and without a word more left the room: Oh, what an expre&s;&s;ive contra&s;t is that countenance capable of! the look he fixt upon my Lord, what a look it was! whil&s;t my heart thrilled as he turned his eyes on me; &s;uch pity, &s;uch
<PB N="202" REF="203">
benevolence beamed forth; I never &s;hall for|get it: whil&s;t my &s;en&s;es la&s;t, they will never lo&s;e that impre&s;&s;ion: I became in&s;en&s;ible to Lord G.'s cruelty; in &s;hort, my friend, I thoroughly de&s;pi&s;ed him, and &s;eeing him &s;tand confounded, &s;welling with rage and &s;hame, irre&s;olute, aba&s;hed, and not knowing what next to do, I was willing to retire from &s;o mortifying a &s;ight, and humbly demanded if he had any further commands for me.</P>
<P>Nothing to trouble me with.</P>
<P>Had he re&s;olved upon the place of my de&s;|tination? Stay, Madam, cried he, and at that in&s;tant a &s;ervant delivered him a letter; he opened it, and as he read it his colour chang|ed, he &s;eemed perplexed, and after a con&s;i|derable time he &s;aid, Did you know of this, Madam? was you informed of this event in Sir Francis Arundel's family? The letter is from him.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured him I knew of no event in Sir Francis's family; I had had no manner of conver&s;ation with Mr. Arundel that day.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;trange, &s;aid he, your friend &s;hould not impart to you &s;uch good news, &s;uch a re|volution in his fortune: Sir Francis writes me
<PB N="203" REF="204">
word he has lo&s;t his only &s;on in a duel; that he has adopted his nephew, who has ju&s;t left us, and in very civil terms reque&s;ts of me to relea&s;e him for a time at lea&s;t, as he means to bring him into Parliament upon the vacancy in his borough. This is a very unexpected event; I wi&s;h I had known it a little &s;ooner; Sir Francis has always been my very good friend, but I always under&s;tood he was at enmity with that branch of his family, which Mr. Arundel belongs to, and had no conception this young man was in his good graces.&mdash;Oh! my dear friend, what was then my tran&s;port, my exul|tation!&mdash;equalled by nothing, unle&s;s by my Lord G.'s remor&s;e and vexation.</P>
<P>I am a&s;toni&s;hed Arundel did not mention this to me, continued my Lord, (talking to him&s;elf, becau&s;e he would not deign to addre&s;s him&s;elf to me, though it was plain he wi&s;hed to be an&s;wered.) I cannot think why he would conceal a thing of this &s;ort; it would have al|tered the ca&s;e very widely; I &s;hould have held a very different language to him; Sir Francis is the la&s;t man in England I would wi&s;h to of|fend; his &s;upport is very nece&s;&s;ary to us at this pinch; I have pledged my&s;elf for him
<PB N="204" REF="205">
and his other member to the cabinet: ten to one but this angry young man will turn the tables upon me; perhaps he will be a &s;peaker; by the &s;ample he has given me I &s;hould ex|pect it.&mdash;He was now thoroughly weary of his &s;oliloquy, and therefore concluded by de|manding of me if I did not think Mr. Arun|del had talents to make an orator.</P>
<P>So &s;trange a que&s;tion &s;hewed the incohe|rence of his thoughts, and I really knew not how to help him out by any an&s;wer I could give: I therefore &s;imply ob&s;erved, that I was no judge of Mr. Arundel's talents, but I had the highe&s;t opinion of his principles, and made no doubt he would do him&s;elf credit in any &s;tation of life.</P>
<P>My Lord now applied him&s;elf to the bell, and bade the &s;ervant who attended, go up to Mr. Arundel's room and &s;ay that he would call upon him: the an&s;wer was, that Mr. Arun|del had left the hou&s;e, and was ju&s;t gone out in a chair.</P>
<P>This was a fre&s;h blow to my Lord, and I think I have &s;eldom &s;een him &s;o di&s;concerted. I now made a &s;econd effort to go, but he again &s;topped me, for even my company was now,
<PB N="205" REF="206">
I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ome relief to his own, at lea&s;t I &s;erved him as a butt to vent his ill-humour upon, and divert it in &s;ome degree from him|&s;elf.&mdash;And pray, Madam, &s;ays he, how does your Lady&s;hip account for this young man's not informing me of his cou&s;in's death, and the great fortune that &s;o unexpectedly de|volves upon him? for Sir Francis, let me tell you, is extremely wealthy.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, my Lord, replied I, as this event was no part of his defence, he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate it.</P>
<P>In my opinion now, it would have been the very be&s;t part of his defence.</P>
<P>Perhaps he was in hopes his integrity would have been &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, and did not chu&s;e to be indebted for his exculpation to intere&s;t, when he had innocence to plead, and the merit of a &s;acrifice to the repo&s;e of your Lord&s;hip's family, which I have no doubt co&s;t him dear to make: in that light I re|gard his &s;ilence as one among&s;t many in|&s;tances of the great delicacy of his way of thinking.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip owes him a good turn, and
<PB N="206" REF="207">
I perceive you are re&s;olved to be as &s;tout an advocate for him as he is for you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII. Lady Loui&s;a G. to Lady Jane S.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of tho&s;e unexpected events, which &s;eems as if it was the fabricated incident of a novel, has ju&s;t happened, and Mr. Arun|del is of a &s;udden become heir to Sir Francis Arundel's great e&s;tate by the melancholy ca|ta&s;trophe of a duel, in which his cou&s;in, a very fine young man, was &s;hot through the lungs, and died upon the ground.</P>
<P>Oh my Jane, what agonies have I e&s;caped by the peaceable conclu&s;ion of this terrifying affair with Sir George Revel! To you alone
<PB N="207" REF="208">
is the &s;ecret revealed, for who&s;e &s;ake tho&s;e ago|nies were endured: Had then my eyes no lan|guage in them, when Arundel, in the bene|volence of his heart, made a &s;acrifice of his re|luctant &s;pirit to the pre&s;ervation of my health and peace? Alas, alas! is it not too plain he does not think of me? had he been a lover, he could not have wanted intuition to &s;py out the &s;ecret workings of my &s;oul; and it now wounds me to the quick, when I reflect upon this proof of his indifference. Nor is this all; proof ri&s;es upon proof, for had his heart but felt the &s;lighte&s;t touch of love, he never would have put his re&s;entment a&s;ide to clear the pa&s;|&s;age for a rival; no, where love is in the ca&s;e, jealou&s;y will enflame even a coward again&s;t his competitor, and Arundel's courage wants nothing to animate it.</P>
<P>Oh, Jane! how the&s;e reflections humble me. How fal&s;e and fooli&s;h is the world's flattery! What avails it me, that I have been the butt and gazing-&s;tock of all the &s;taring vacant eyes in every public place? Perhaps there is &s;ome catching quaint caprice about my form, &s;ome gari&s;h &s;hewy ornament, that Nature has embroidered on it, which &s;illy cox|combs
<PB N="208" REF="209">
are trapped with, but which men of ta&s;te turn away from with di&s;gu&s;t. I can never be brought to think I have any attractions, but &s;uch as I ought to blu&s;h for, when I could draw to me only &s;uch a wretch as Sir George Revel, and repel Arundel; 'tis plain that Virtue flies me, while Vice for its own loath&s;ome ends pur&s;ues: I mu&s;t renounce either my&s;elf or Arundel; I mu&s;t believe I am unworthy of his pure regards, or hold him for in&s;en&s;ible and blind. He thinks, no doubt, that he made a mighty &s;acrifice for my &s;ake, when he put by re&s;entment; alas! how much more have I done for him, when, to pre&s;erve his life from ri&s;que, I &s;uffered him to think that I was &s;o depraved in heart, as to endure the addre&s;&s;es of Sir George? Who&s;e lo&s;s then is greate&s;t? his, in being robbed of his revenge, or mine, who am ruined in his good opinion? I have deceived him into my own de&s;truction.</P>
<P>What is now to be done? You will &s;ay, perhaps, a &s;econd conference may &s;et it right:&mdash;a &s;econd conference is now no longer in my reach; he is gone for ever; an angry &s;epara|tion has taken place between my father and him; he has left the hou&s;e never to return to
<PB N="209" REF="210">
it again: adopted by his uncle, he now lives with him, and holds no further corre&s;pondence in this ho&s;tile quarter. Shall I write to him? No: if there is &s;uch a thing on earth as com|mendable pride, if there is &s;uch an obliga|tion exi&s;ting as duty to a parent, I am now re|&s;pon&s;ible to tho&s;e demands; in tho&s;e fetters I am chained, and I would rather die than beg and be de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>There was a moment when I thought he felt &s;ome little influence at his heart from this unworthy form: 'twas our fir&s;t interview; my father brought him down to us at Spring-Grove; he pre&s;ented him to my Lady G.; Arundel bowed re&s;pectfully, and addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome words to her I know not what, but proper no doubt they were, and becoming: he u&s;hered him next to me, and then methought his eye be&s;poke a &s;udden &s;en&s;ibility, the colour came and went upon his cheek, and he was &s;ilent; but his look was eloquent and my re&s;pon&s;ive heart held conver&s;e in the &s;ame mute language with him: I was not then, as now, a &s;pectacle &s;o pale and &s;ickly; it was languor, not di&s;|ea&s;e, and &s;uch a languor only as di&s;po&s;ed my heart to every &s;oft impre&s;&s;ion: it was even|ing,
<PB N="210" REF="211">
a &s;oft and tender gloom threw his fine form into that happy &s;hade, which gives the features a pathetic tint in harmony with all the melting pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul&mdash;Oh, Jane, that moment was my fate; he then exchanged a look with me, that &s;unk into my heart; it was then I found there is no metaphor in what the poets tell of love, I felt that he has real arrows. My father called for mu&s;ic; Why did he &s;o? It is <HI>the food of love,</HI> and mine
<Q>Had &s;tomach for it all.</Q>
I &s;ung; it was my favorite cantabile of Sac|chini; it was love again; love in its mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive language. Arundel's accompany|ment in&s;pired me to acquit my&s;elf better than ever I performed before: his tones were pitch|ed with &s;o much delicacy, they were the very echo of my voice; my father was enraptured, and I confe&s;s I never was in &s;uch humour with my&s;elf.&mdash;But I am grown childi&s;h and prattle the &s;ame rhap&s;ody over again, which I have pe&s;tered you with in a former letter; bear with my weakne&s;s, gentle Jane!</P>
<P>The next day took my Lord to town, and Arundel remained with us, but night and &s;ad
<PB N="211" REF="212">
reflection had intervened; rea&s;on had now conjured up a powerful and gloomy antago|ni&s;t in the per&s;on of De&s;pair, who was able to conte&s;t the point with Love, and repre&s;ented to my mind a numerous train of impo&s;&s;ibili|ties ranged in dreadful array again&s;t the hope|le&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, that was taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me. Alarmed at the danger of my &s;ituation, I no longer invited opportunities of conver&s;ing with Arundel; I even avoided his eyes as much as I was able; I &s;aw with plea&s;ure that my mo|ther began to engro&s;s him wholly, and I never was a party in their evening walks: I dreaded the fa&s;cinating powers of mu&s;ic, and he, con|ceiving that the exertion was too great for my &s;trength, never prompted me to &s;ing. Much of the day he pa&s;&s;ed out of doors with my Lady in vi&s;iting her con&s;ervatory, and in other rural occupations, which &s;he takes much delight in; our amu&s;ement within doors chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in his reading to us, and at tho&s;e times I took care to employ my&s;elf with my needle, be&s;towing no more than the attention of one &s;en&s;e upon him: but even that &s;en&s;e was made an avenue to Love; Love could even <HI>there plant eyes,</HI> and though <Q><PB N="212" REF="213">
<L>at one entrance quite &s;hut out,</L>
<L>Shone inward.</L></Q>
He gave us the pathetic novel of <HI>Lady Julia Mandeville</HI>; What weakne&s;s tempted me to &s;elect it for his reading? The &s;tory was too appo&s;ite, the cata&s;trophe too touching. Could he want a key to the fable, when my tears were &s;o plain a comment to point out the ap|plication? Where was his intelligence, if it e&s;caped him?</P>
<P>And now, my deare&s;t Jane, I have lo&s;t &s;ight of him perhaps for ever: now then is the moment to begin a noble effort, and found a re&s;olution that &s;hall repair the ruins of my peace: I will forget him.&mdash;Stop, let me not promi&s;e too much; I'll not attempt impo&s;&s;ibi|lities; I will forget to love him: convinced as I now am, that he does not entertain a thought of me, I will call home tho&s;e &s;light|ed affections, who&s;e forward tenders have been repul&s;ed with &s;corn: I have a pride of na|ture, that is the very palladium of my heart; I will &s;ummon every pa&s;&s;ion to its aid, and it will be hard if &s;uch an army of allies &s;hall not be a match for one &s;ingle, un&s;upported propen|&s;ity,
<PB N="213" REF="214">
however &s;trong. A&s;&s;i&s;t me at this cri&s;is, my beloved friend, encourage me with your applau&s;e, &s;econd me with your coun&s;els, &s;ay every thing for me, but on your allegiance breathe not a word for Sir George.&mdash;And above all things, if you love me, and would wi&s;h to pre&s;erve my &s;en&s;es, utter not a &s;ylla|ble in prophane di&s;prai&s;e of Arundel.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII. Lady Loui&s;a G. to Lady Jane S.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I wrote to you la&s;t, I was not aware that matters had gone to &s;uch lengths between my father and mother, as to make a &s;eparation nece&s;&s;ary. Ever &s;ince that unhappy affair at Spring Grove, my Lord has harboured &s;uch re&s;entment in his mind, and been &s;o ob&s;tinately re&s;olved to believe that &s;he has been indu&s;trious to prejudice me again&s;t Sir George Revel, that I am per&s;uaded no|thing
<PB N="214" REF="215">
but an ab&s;olute acquie&s;cence on my part could have undeceived him; I mu&s;t have made a total &s;acrifice of my happine&s;s to have pre&s;erved any tolerable harmony between my parents; but even this would have been a very precarious reconciliation, for the e&s;&s;en|tials of love are wanting, and though my fa|ther's views might have been &s;erved by the match, I have rea&s;on to know that my mother would have been rendered infinitely more mi|&s;erable by &s;uch a fatal mea&s;ure than by what has now befallen her, which though painful for the pre&s;ent, will &s;ave her from many &s;ufferings hereafter.</P>
<P>You may think perhaps that I might have qua&s;hed the di&s;pute at once, by peremptorily refu&s;ing Sir George, and taking it entirely on my&s;elf; but believe me that would never have done, nor would my mother hear of the propo&s;al when I &s;tated it, a&s;&s;uring me that it would only make my father more outrageous again&s;t her, with the further bad con&s;equence of reviving the affair between Arundel and Sir George, who was only led to make an apo|logy by the hopes held out to him by my father.</P>
<P>I have however confided to her my inten|tions
<PB N="215" REF="216">
with re&s;pect to that gentleman, and the joy and comfort which it gave her alleviated the pains of parting; &s;he be&s;eeched me to temporize &s;ome time longer, as well on her own account, as to prevent an immediate rup|ture between the parties &s;o newly reconciled. This you will allow is a delicate and difficult part for me to act, but this I have neverthele&s;s promi&s;ed to undertake.</P>
<P>You will be curious to know if I opened to her on the &s;ubject of Arundel; I did not, and, without giving you all my rea&s;ons for being &s;ilent, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that if ever I find it nece&s;&s;ary to communicate with her on the &s;tate of my heart towards that per&s;on, it will be be&s;t done by letter after a time, and in ab&s;ence from each other. I know the &s;trength of her mind, and the &s;olidity of her under&s;tanding: retirement and &s;olitude, &s;o formidable to &s;ome &s;pirits, will to her's be &s;alutary and re&s;tora|tive. Then will be the time, if rea&s;on cannot expel this hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, to confide it to her&mdash;alas! to what purpo&s;e even then?</P>
<P>I have not &s;een Arundel &s;ince he left us; I believe he gives up his time almo&s;t entirely to his uncle, with whom he lives, and who is &s;aid
<PB N="216" REF="217">
to be in a very declining &s;tate. I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay, that my father did him&s;elf no honor by the manner in which he treated him at part|ing; and what makes it wor&s;e, he at that time was not informed of the change in his fortune, but talked to him as to an ab&s;olute dependant, and menaced him with &s;tirring up his father's di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t him. No &s;ooner had he left the hou&s;e, than a letter from Sir Francis revealed the affair of the duel, and of Arundel's adoption in con&s;equence of it: then it &s;eems my Lord was mortified in the extreme, and repented of his behavior; and of &s;uch con&s;equence is it to his politics to pre&s;erve a good under&s;tanding with Sir Fran|cis, that I have rea&s;on to believe, if my mo|ther would have undertaken to have made his peace with Arundel, &s;he might have made her own at the &s;ame time. This I know for certain, that my father has be&s;tirred him&s;elf very a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, in hopes of healing the breach, and has been with the General, and no doubt with Arundel him&s;elf, for that purpo&s;e. How he has &s;ucceeded in conci|liating matters I cannot pretend to &s;ay, but he hinted to me that he had obtained a re|&s;pectable
<PB N="217" REF="218">
&s;ituation for Arundel, if he cho&s;e to accept it.</P>
<P>My opinion goes with my fears, that the thing is irretrievable, and the more &s;o from the unju&s;t and cruel mea&s;ures, which have been taken towards my unoffending mother.</P>
<P>What I &s;uffered upon parting from her no words of mine can de&s;cribe: her &s;pirits, thank Heaven, were greatly &s;upported in tho&s;e painful moments by the a&s;&s;urances I gave her with regard to Sir George Revel. She is for the pre&s;ent gone to Spring Grove, where &s;he will pa&s;s only a few days, till pre|parations can be made for her removal to a greater di&s;tance, and a place provided for her, which &s;he has cho&s;en for her retirement, and for which &s;he is now in negotiation.</P>
<P>My father has invited Mrs. Courtenhall to be with me in my mother's ab&s;ence. What a &s;ub&s;titute! Sir George Revel dines here to|day <HI>en famille,</HI> and I am to endure his hate|ful pre&s;ence.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV. Arundel to Charles Mortlake.</HEAD>
<P>I Think I told you in the early part of our corre&s;pondence that I was not fond of writ|ing about family matters, and telling long un|intere&s;ting &s;tories of per&s;ons and things, which you are not concerned with and which I have no right over: I am not however &s;crupulous to inform you that Lady G. has been com|pelled to a &s;eparation by the ill-treatment of her Lord, who is pre&s;&s;ing on a match with Sir George Revel and Lady Loui&s;a, and is plea&s;ed without any grounds to conclude that his wi&s;hes have been traver&s;ed by her Lady&s;hip, with whom he has al&s;o done me the unmerited honor to &s;uppo&s;e that I have been in league for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This ridiculous man, who has not a trace in his mind that re&s;embles ju&s;tice, unle&s;s ob&s;ti|nacy be one, had the ab&s;urdity to charge me with this to my face and in the pre&s;ence al&s;o
<PB N="223" REF="224">
of his Lady. My part of the charge was ea&s;ily &s;ettled, for I was &s;oon out of his power, but it was not &s;o with Lady G.; &s;he has been obli|ged to take refuge from his tyranny by retiring from her family, which &s;he actually put into effect the &s;ame evening, and is now &s;eeking that repo&s;e in &s;olitude, which in his &s;ociety it was not po&s;&s;ible for her to enjoy.</P>
<P>For that excellent Lady my heart will ever retain the warme&s;t gratitude, and it gives me un&s;peakable pain to be no longer in a capacity of paying her tho&s;e attentions, from which &s;he u&s;ed to derive no &s;mall degree of con&s;olation. I have taken every means in my power &s;ince her departure of making known to her how deeply I am impre&s;&s;ed with the remembrance of her kindne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion, and how ardently I &s;hall &s;eize every opportunity of ma|nife&s;ting the truth of my profe&s;&s;ions; but I have not thought it advi&s;eable in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs to write to her, though I am vain enough to think it may be what &s;he wi&s;hes. At the pre&s;ent moment her &s;ituation is extremely critical, and I am under great anxiety on her account; if her difficulties en|crea&s;e and this injurious man continues to per|&s;ecute

<P>Lady Loui&s;a's match with Sir George Re|vel is I &s;uppo&s;e in a train to take place, and probably only waits the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of her health: report is circulating it as a thing decided, but in that I do not place ab&s;olute faith.

I know not how to think there can be any generous &s;entiments in that heart, which &s;eems engro&s;&s;ed with pride and arro|gance; at the &s;ame time I am loth to &s;uppo&s;e her capable of overlooking character in the choice of a hu&s;band, and of following either the mere impul&s;e of the eye, or the meaner motives, which the greatne&s;s of his fortune may appear to &s;ugge&s;t; this I am &s;ure can never operate upon a nature &s;o liberal and &s;o noble as her's, and accordingly I mu&s;t believe &s;he di&s;cerns &s;ome qualities in her lover, which have not fallen under my ob&s;ervation; and to own the truth this may well be, as I have only
<PB N="225" REF="226">
contemplated him in the unfavorable moments of in&s;olence and anger.</P>
<P>The day before I quitted the family I had a conver&s;ation with Lady Loui&s;a, which was very intere&s;ting, and if I had been di&s;po&s;ed to put my own meaning upon certain pa&s;&s;ages and expre&s;&s;ions, which were equivocal enough to encourage &s;uch an idle interpretation, I might have made a fine fool of my&s;elf truly. Yet if all that anxiety to prevent our duel was the &s;ole re&s;ult of her fears for the &s;afety of Sir George, any man who was a witne&s;s to what &s;he &s;uffered might have &s;afely &s;worn that the fir&s;t moment of his relea&s;e would have been the fir&s;t of his happine&s;s al&s;o, in&s;tead of which many days have pa&s;&s;ed and I have no rea&s;on to believe he is yet in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her ab&s;olute con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Surely, Charles, it is fair arguing to con|clude, that if he was indeed the object of her love, I, who in that interview appeared before her as his antagoni&s;t, ought to have been the object of her aver&s;ion: yet this did not &s;eem to be the ca&s;e; it is true &s;he had a point to carry, and that might lead her to u&s;e &s;oothing words in conver&s;ing with me; but had there
<PB N="226" REF="227">
been that abhorrence in her heart, it is le&s;s po&s;|&s;ible with her than with any body I ever met with to di&s;gui&s;e her looks and counterfeit a complacency &s;he does not feel. On the con|trary, I beheld nothing but the &s;weete&s;t coun|tenance mixed with the mo&s;t affecting &s;adne&s;s, at all times there was a mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive tender|ne&s;s in her eyes, and once &s;he gave a loo&s;e to her tears covering her beautiful face, to conceal from me the di&s;order &s;he was in.</P>
<P>The&s;e words in particular made an impre&s;|&s;ion upon me at the time &s;he uttered them, and I have frequently revolved them in my thoughts &s;ince as &s;omething too my&s;terious for me even to gue&s;s at&mdash;<HI>Perhaps,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>you have mi&s;taken me in &s;ome particulars, but time will clear up all things; to time I mu&s;t refer you, and by that I &s;hall be ju&s;tified in your opi|nion.</HI></P>
<P>If time, that is to be the interpreter of this my&s;tery, &s;hould &s;hew me that Sir George is all this while following a fal&s;e clue through the labyrinth of di&s;appointment&mdash;Oh Charles!&mdash;but I will not indulge the idea&mdash;&s;he mu&s;t be his, and I will detach my thoughts from her, and fly the &s;ight of her when &s;acrificed to that
<PB N="227" REF="228">
wretch, as I would avoid the contemplation of a noble mind, when deprived of its rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e ladies, mother and daughter, might almo&s;t pa&s;s for &s;i&s;ters; there is a &s;triking &s;imi|litude in their features, and an expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions and affections in their eyes, only at different periods of life and in different degrees of &s;en&s;ibility. In the mother it is vi|&s;ible that &s;orrow has con&s;pired with time to &s;often down tho&s;e fires, which nobody, who looks upon the daughter, can behold unmov|ed: the &s;oul of Lady G. is of that pen&s;ive and feeling ca&s;t, which leans to retirement and tho&s;e tranquil &s;cenes of life, to which humble una&s;|&s;uming virtue delights to re&s;ort from the tu|mult of the world. The country is her pa&s;&s;ion, and in a private condition &s;he might have ta&s;ted that &s;erenity, which her elevated rank only helps to deprive her of. Fortune &s;eemed to have de&s;tined her to tho&s;e views, for which nature had fitted her di&s;po&s;ition, but an un|common &s;hare of beauty and the extreme ele|gance of her figure in a luckle&s;s hour caught the eyes of Lord G. and the ambition of her parents devoted her to his arms. Oh Charles, how you would be charmed with her &s;ociety!
<PB N="228" REF="229">
How curiou&s;ly hath nature <HI>mixed up the ele|ments</HI> in her, that the contagious &s;phere, in which &s;he has moved, could never fix a &s;pot, which even the micro&s;copic eye of envy could &s;py out and &s;ay&mdash;<HI>Here is a blemi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Lord G. who treated me with very little delicacy, when he looked upon me as a depen|dant, now &s;ees me with different eyes, and an event, which does not rai&s;e me one atom in my own e&s;teem, <HI>adds cubits to my &s;tature</HI> in his way of mea&s;uring mankind. In a time like this, when parties are &s;o nearly balanced, the proprietor of a borough may expect a very low bow from a tottering mini&s;ter; and his Lord&s;hip, who probably feels him&s;elf in that predicament, &s;eems to think a little manage|ment may be nece&s;&s;ary to bring me back to my allegiance, and make me &s;till the crea|ture of his purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>With this wi&s;e end in view he called upon my uncle, and began to round him with many fine &s;peeches, feeling his way cautiou&s;ly to di&s;|cover how much I had imparted to him of what pa&s;&s;ed between us upon our la&s;t conver|&s;ation. He affected to be &s;hocked, when the General told him I con&s;idered my&s;elf as di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
<PB N="229" REF="230">
in the mo&s;t peremptory manner, and de&s;ired to apologize to me in per&s;on for any mi&s;under&s;tanding that had taken place, pro|te&s;ting that his intentions had ever been mo&s;t friendly towards me; he hoped we &s;hould al|ways be upon good terms, and as he had been honored with my uncle's &s;upport, flattered him|&s;elf he might depend upon mine.</P>
<P>To all this Sir Francis coldly replied, that he mu&s;t refer his Lord&s;hip to me; he had di&s;|charged his mind of all tho&s;e matters, and left me entirely to my own di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>This produced an interview between his Lord&s;hip and me; he addre&s;&s;ed me in a fine &s;peech crammed with many courtly flouri&s;hes, in which there was a mighty deal of conde|&s;cen&s;ion, abundance of flattery, &s;ome apology, many profe&s;&s;ions and no truth: it was <HI>pride that licked the du&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wered him in as civil terms as I could u&s;e, without committing my&s;elf in &s;uch a man|ner, as might lead him to believe I was im|po&s;ed upon by his profe&s;&s;ions: I took care to remind him for my future ju&s;tification, that I had, happily for my&s;elf, never been in tho&s;e confidential habits with his Lord&s;hip, as to tie
<PB N="230" REF="231">
me down from any mea&s;ures or opinions I might think fit to adopt hereafter; and I begged leave to a&s;&s;ure him, that if I had not felt my&s;elf my own ma&s;ter in tho&s;e re&s;pects, I would never have con&s;ented to come into Par|liament.</P>
<P>He now tried a new experiment, by propo|&s;ing to me a &s;ituation in the corps diploma|tique, where he could make an opening for me at Rati&s;bon, which he warmly recommend|ed as a fir&s;t &s;tep in the line, and for which he was plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ure me that I was peculiarly well qualified both by nature and acquire|ments.</P>
<P>To this I &s;hortly an&s;wered, that as I had his Lord&s;hip's own authority to refer to for ex|pecting no favors from him, &s;o I had formed my own re&s;olution to receive none: he mu&s;t therefore excu&s;e me if I declined any offers he could make me.</P>
<P>Thus we parted, and thus I conclude.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. The Counte&s;s of G. to the Hon. Mrs. Dormer.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Spring Grove.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have now advanced one &s;tage towards my exile, and am preparing to &s;et out in a few days for the place of my final de&s;tination.</P>
<P>There is a little village on the coa&s;t of Kent, which I have fixt upon for my retreat: it has been a favorite &s;pot with me from my child|hood, being about three miles from my father's hou&s;e where I was born: it was part of his e&s;tate, but being entailed upon the male heir, now belongs to my fir&s;t cou&s;in, who has very readily accommodated me with the hire of it.</P>
<P>This will be my a&s;ylum from a tyranny no longer &s;upportable.</P>
<P>The bitterne&s;s of parting from my Loui&s;a was greatly &s;oftened by the comforting expre&s;|&s;ions, with which &s;he cheared my &s;inking &s;pirits in tho&s;e painful moments:&mdash;Oh my beloved mother! &s;aid the generous girl, the cruel treat|ment you unju&s;tly &s;uffer on my account cuts
<PB N="234" REF="235">
me to the &s;oul; &s;ubmit to it however with patience for a time, re&s;ign your&s;elf to the will of God, and he will &s;upport you; perhaps it is a di&s;pen&s;ation that will prove a ble&s;&s;ing to you in the end, and even now you &s;hould forbear to lament it, as it withdraws you from a &s;cene replete with &s;orrows, and from an oppre&s;&s;ion you can no longer endure. The virtues of your heart and the &s;trength of your under&s;tand|ing will &s;upply you with re&s;ources in your &s;oli|tude, and it &s;hall be my grateful ta&s;k to relieve it by a continual intercour&s;e of letters, in which I will give you a faithful journal of my time. I tru&s;t my father's animo&s;ity will not forbid my continuing to you the&s;e proofs of duty and affection, without which our &s;eparation would be intolerable to me.</P>
<P>I leave you, my dear child, I replied, with a bleeding heart, comforted however by the&s;e dutiful expre&s;&s;ions, and penetrated by the ge|nerous and tender proofs of your affection: I leave you in a painful, perilous moment, in the very cri&s;is of your fate; but I am driven from my duty, I do not de&s;ert it. If you marry Sir George Revel becau&s;e your heart is with him and your judgment approves of his
<PB N="235" REF="236">
character, I hope God will ble&s;s you in your choice, and that I &s;hall find my&s;elf in an error; but if you take him upon any other motives, if your father's commands over-rule you, if the &s;plendor of fortune allures you, and the cry of the world provokes your vanity to be the riche&s;t bride in England, I tremble for the con&s;equences; I prote&s;t again&s;t the deed.</P>
<P>To this &s;he replied&mdash;How I &s;hall regret you words cannot de&s;cribe; but if ever it is my lot to marry, it &s;hall be the fir&s;t object of my liberty to fly to your arms; and be a&s;&s;ured I will never unite my&s;elf to any man, whom you could not love, and who would not love you. This rea&s;on alone would have been de|ci&s;ive again&s;t Sir George Revel, had he been in all other re&s;pects as much to be approved of, as I now think he is ju&s;tly to be abhorred.</P>
<P>What, cried I, what is it I hear? Doth my Loui&s;a mean to &s;ay that &s;he will not marry Sir George Revel?</P>
<P>Never, &s;he replied; nor force, nor per&s;ua|&s;ion &s;hall prevail with me: I will die before I will do it. This has been my fixt determina|tion from the fir&s;t, but I would not impart it to my dear mother, whil&s;t &s;he was a&s;&s;erting in
<PB N="236" REF="237">
her defence to my father, that &s;he had not communicated with me on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Generous creature! &s;aid I, then I am com|forted indeed; this &s;weetens the bittere&s;t mo|ment of my life; now I can part from my child with &s;ome fortitude: and &s;o &s;aying, I enfolded her in my arms and &s;hed a &s;hower of grateful tears upon her neck.</P>
<P>Thus was I con&s;oled by this amiable crea|ture; and amid&s;t the agonies I feel in &s;eparation from her, I &s;upport my&s;elf by reflecting, that a young woman of her uncommon attractions, with great fortune and high rank to &s;et them off, cannot long remain &s;ingle, and then my lo&s;t happine&s;s will be recovered: in the mean time, as my interference in the choice of a hu&s;|band for her would only draw re&s;entment upon me, and probably oppo&s;ition to her wi&s;hes from my unfriendly Lord, it may be well for me to be ab&s;ent at this cri&s;is.</P>
<P>And now, my dear animated friend, do not let this &s;ecret of Loui&s;a's determination again&s;t Sir George Revel e&s;cape from your lips; do not &s;o much as endanger it by a hint; for it is nece&s;&s;ary to temporize a little longer.</P>
<P>Will you vi&s;it me in my hermitage? I am
<PB N="237" REF="238">
&s;ure you will. Your friend&s;hip is not of that holiday &s;ort, which can only &s;hew it&s;elf in the &s;un&s;hine of fortune; you will not fly from the <HI>hou&s;e of mourning,</HI> but will chear your widow|ed friend in her affliction.</P>
<P>But remember, my good &s;oul, there is one &s;ubject that cannot chear me any longer: let the name of Arundel be pro&s;cribed in our cor|re&s;pondence henceforward! Sport not with the feelings of your friend, nor let your roving imagination lead me any more over rocks and precipices, like a deceitful meteor in the night. <HI>I fly to conquer</HI>; I &s;ink into &s;olitude that I may teach my&s;elf to forget.</P>
<P>Since he left our hou&s;e I have never once &s;et eyes upon him, nor hath he written one farewell line to me. It is well! he refines upon propriety; he points me out the road which I mu&s;t take; he is at once my precep|tor and my model.</P>
<P>I have the happine&s;s to hear he is recovered of his wound: the old General, by the way, has had a paralytic &s;troke, and is thought to be near his end; Arundel will then be ma&s;ter of a noble fortune; he takes his &s;eat in Parliament as &s;oon as the writ can be made out, and I
<PB N="238" REF="239">
cannot doubt but he will do him&s;elf much ho|nor in the &s;enate; for he has genius, know|ledge and elocution, with every exterior grace of per&s;on&mdash;how captivating! A voice &s;o ex|qui&s;itely tuned to per&s;ua&s;ion, that the ear, which li&s;tens to its harmony, of force &s;urren|ders up the &s;oul of every one that hears it: his eyes characterize each pa&s;&s;ion, as it &s;hifts within him; they beam with benevolence, they melt with love, they fla&s;h with anger: they pe|netrate the heart; who can re&s;i&s;t them?</P>
<P>I will ri&s;que a prediction that his artillery will be pointed at my Lord per&s;onally, at his party collectively; and though I am not cu|rious after politics, I cannot avoid hearing from all &s;ides that our cabinet totters. Be it &s;o! I believe the be&s;t wi&s;h I can be&s;tow upon my de&s;pot is that of a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution to his power. Small minds are not made for great &s;tations; they are intoxicated by authority; that virtuous ambition, which &s;hould in&s;pire them to advance the glory of their country, beats not in their bo&s;oms; the pa&s;&s;ion they feel is &s;purious and illegitimate: it has the name of ambition perhaps, but it inherits not its dignity nor property. The &s;ervant of the
<PB N="239" REF="240">
public &s;hould have the diligence, fidelity and punctuality of a &s;ervant in humble degree; a per&s;on, de&s;tined by his office to refu&s;e multi|tudes where he gratifies one, &s;hould above all things &s;tudy the art of denying with a good grace: this demands an attribute which my unhappy Lord is wholly de&s;titute of, &s;uavity of manners: I even que&s;tion if he is often lucky enough to gain a friend where he be|&s;tows a favor. I &s;u&s;pect that he will fall un|pitied and de&s;erted. When that hour comes, reflection may come with it, and if he then brings his pa&s;t conduct under &s;trict review, the future may very probably fare the better for it.&mdash;Heaven grant it may!</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes turned my thoughts to|wards a companion in my retirement, &s;ome quiet gentle &s;oul, who will &s;ympathize with my feelings, read, work, walk with me by turns, and wile away the languid hours in harmle&s;s conver&s;ation. But alas! it is in vain to look for &s;uch a being: a gentlewoman &s;he mu&s;t be, and I have &s;uch pity for decayed gentlewomen in the character of dependants, that I &s;hould be a &s;ufferer by her &s;ociety, and, in&s;tead of finding comfort from her, be obliged
<PB N="240" REF="241">
to find it for her. I therefore give up that idea altogether, and determine to take with me only one young woman, who is at pre&s;ent an underling in my family, and &s;eems a &s;en|&s;ible good-humoured girl: &s;he &s;hall be my lady of the bedchamber, for my own Madam is too fine for the &s;ervice, and has be&s;ides an attachment, which I cannot propo&s;e to re|move her from. A hou&s;e-maid and a cook I &s;hall hire in the country, as better for my humble purpo&s;es than tho&s;e of a town educa|tion; one man-&s;ervant I &s;hall al&s;o take of rural &s;tock, and a gardener: this will be my e&s;tabli&s;hment; my pin-money will be my re|venue; and &s;o&mdash;</P>

Who this lady is, what her de&s;cription, age and per&s;on, I &s;hall not &s;ay; whether walking and conver&s;ing with you in the country, or attending upon you during your confinement in town; whether in&s;tructing you as a monitre&s;s, or receiving in|&s;truction from you as a di&s;ciple, whil&s;t you trace out the con&s;tellations in the heavens to her uplifted eyes by night; in whatever act, attitude or employment I contemplate this your amiable companion, I recognize a cha|racter which I cannot be mi&s;taken in. Though <HI>&s;orrow may con&s;pire with time to &s;often down tho&s;e fires,</HI> that are &s;o bright in younger eyes, yet they are fires, which by their gentlene&s;s only lure to a nearer approach, and that &s;or|row, which &s;oftens the beholder al&s;o into pity, and rai&s;es up no incon&s;iderable advocate in the heart.</P>
<P>But what has a monk to do, you will &s;ay, with &s;peculations of this &s;ort? Certainly they are no the&s;is for the &s;chools; yet love has its
<PB N="246" REF="247">
pupils even within the walls of a college, and nature can in&s;truct without the help of a lec|turer. However, as I am neither pupil nor profe&s;&s;or, I &s;hall totally drop a &s;ubject I have no right to &s;peak upon.</P>
<P>Your recovery from a dangerous wound has been followed by a &s;udden change of for|tune, which in the language of the world will be called a very &s;ingular in&s;tance of good for|tune: let me therefore take the world's opi|nion upon tru&s;t, and join your friends in feli|citating you upon your late adoption. Why &s;hould I not? the e&s;tate, that will now de|volve upon you, is the e&s;tate of your family; it has ever been in the li&s;t of contingencies, and you are not taken by &s;urprize, as many are, upon whom chance throws her favors, and without preparation elevates the pro&s;trate &s;on of earth into the up&s;tart man of con&s;e|quence. I give it welcome, therefore, as an event which affords your talents a di&s;play, and enlarges the &s;phere of your activity. I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall be able to appeal to one in&s;tance of a great fortune rationally enjoyed; you will neither languidly &s;ubmit to be the prey of &s;er|vants, or the dupe of &s;harpers; you have ever
<PB N="247" REF="248">
lived in habits of temperance, and who that has once experienced the ble&s;&s;ings of pure &s;im|plicity will pro&s;titute his health, under&s;tanding and con&s;cience, to a life of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s? You are not, thank Heaven, in danger of be|ing &s;eized by the &s;ordid rage of gaming, for you cannot wi&s;h &s;o to employ a &s;uperfluity, which your ta&s;te can di&s;po&s;e of &s;o much more elegantly, and your &s;pirit be&s;tow &s;o bene|ficently.</P>
<P>That you may reap the fir&s;t-fruits of that generous di&s;po&s;ition with all po&s;&s;ible &s;atisfac|tion to your feelings, I accept with thankful|ne&s;s the promi&s;e of your benefice in Kent, and a&s;&s;ure you that it opens to me every pro&s;pect of happine&s;s your friendly heart can wi&s;h it to be accompanied with.</P>
<P>Every circum&s;tance about it, hou&s;e, gar|den, deme&s;ne, the country, river, pari&s;h, the people them&s;elves, all con&s;pire to render it the mo&s;t delectable &s;ituation to me in life; and more than all, its neighbourhood to Arundel-hou&s;e &s;tamps a double value on the gift.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be ordained deacon next Sunday; and I have rea&s;on to believe my Lord of Ely
<PB N="248" REF="249">
will not refu&s;e me prie&s;t's orders very &s;hortly after. I certainly enter upon this office in hum|ble hope and with a &s;erious mind; I have well reflected upon the nature of our church e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, and am re&s;olute to abide by all its forms, ordinances and articles, as therein laid down, without deviation; for I hope I am in|capable of prevaricating with an oath, and entering upon the&s;e &s;olemn engagements with an un&s;teady, wavering allegiance; no, Arun|del, I will imitate the &s;ectaries in nothing but their diligence and indu&s;try; neither will I enter the pale of peace and charity with a heart that can be hardened by a &s;pirit of into|lerance and bigotry.</P>
<P>To be a good prie&s;t in a country pari&s;h, &s;uch as you de&s;cribe, is the height of my wi&s;hes, and if they &s;ucceed, nothing &s;hall tempt me out of my &s;tation; where I fix, there I will fall; your Kenti&s;hmen &s;hall have me, &s;uch as I am, once and for ever; for them I will live, and among&s;t them I will die: I am no &s;eeker after change or prefer|ment; nor, when I am the &s;ervant of God, will I &s;ubmit to be the &s;lave of ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="250">It appears to me, that &s;ome clergymen &s;eem to think their whole duties are com|pri&s;ed in the &s;ervices of the &s;eventh day; but when &s;o many in&s;tances happily occur to &s;hew the great moral advantages which may be de|rived to a pari&s;h from the careful &s;uperintend|ance of a mini&s;ter who re&s;ides con&s;tantly among&s;t them, it is a &s;trong call upon a man's con&s;cience to &s;tand by his tru&s;t, and con&s;ider every day in the week no le&s;s a day of duty than the &s;eventh. As to what concerns the ta&s;k of preaching only, my idea is, that a con|gregation is fir&s;t to be in&s;tructed in the reli|gion they profe&s;s, and that morality will &s;pring from religion, as the fruit from the tree. I have therefore no partiality for tho&s;e &s;light e&s;&s;ays, &s;o much in vogue, which &s;eem compo&s;ed for fa&s;hionable freethinkers, and one would almo&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, if charity did not forbid the imputation, that they were even compo&s;ed by freethinkers. This kind of flim&s;y doctrine (like fair-weather &s;ailing, that may be per|formed with any ordinary tackle) is very con|venient for indolent divines, as it requires little labour, and no depth of &s;tudy; preach|ers, who court popularity from polite congre|gations,

affect to &s;uit their language to their company, and, avoiding all har&s;h truths, tell them rather what they like, than what they ought, to hear; the crimes, that cry out for correction, are left untouched; and the la&s;h only applied where nobody pre&s;ent can be hit by it.</P>
<P>For my part, though I would with great care avoid puzzling the under&s;tandings of my rural flock; yet I conceive it is very fea&s;ible, in plain and ea&s;y language, and by natural de|ductions, to proceed &s;y&s;tematically in a chain of di&s;cour&s;es through all the nece&s;&s;ary proofs of revealed religion. If this were done in a conci&s;e, intelligible manner, and &s;o methodized as the memory might retain it, I &s;hould ex|pect it would enable an attentive congrega|tion, even in a country pari&s;h, <HI>to give a rea|&s;on for the faith that is in them,</HI> and with this view it might be proper to repeat it as occa|&s;ion &s;eemed to require. Upon this &s;y&s;tem, once e&s;tabli&s;hed in the mind, all the moral duties of Chri&s;tianity might be grounded, not in a vague and de&s;ultory manner, but in the chain and order of their dependancies one upon another; for I take it as a point ad|mitted,

that teachers of all &s;orts mu&s;t proceed by method, if they mean to fix in their hear|ers memories what they e&s;&s;ay to teach: li&s;ten to the rambling arguments of a man, who has no mathematical principles in his head, and though he talks to you in the diction of Tully, they will be words without ideas, a mere clu&s;|ter of unmeaning &s;entences.

<HEAD>LETTER XL. Lady Loui&s;a G. to Lady Jane S.</HEAD>
<P>I AM &s;o haunted by Sir George Revel, and &s;uffer his vi&s;its with &s;o ill a grace, that I can wear the ma&s;k no longer, and mu&s;t po&s;i|tively give him a flat refu&s;al the very next time he baits me with his odious addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>My father begins to find he has gained no|thing upon me by my mother's ab&s;ence, and grows very impatient; he is a&s;toni&s;hed what I can di&s;cover in Sir George to object to, and then runs over a number of particulars, every one of which he thinks the be&s;t recommenda|tion a man can have, and I think the &s;um to|tal would not weigh again&s;t one grain of merit. Oh, Arundel, if nature had not given me a heart to de&s;pi&s;e the&s;e vanities, you would have taught me!</P>
<P>Whil&s;t my father is for ever tutoring and tormenting me in private, my di&s;appointed lo|ver runs bellowing up and down, abu&s;ing me, to all the world, as the verie&s;t coquette and
<PB N="253" REF="254">
jilt in nature, and I have too good rea&s;on to believe that his animo&s;ity again&s;t my exiled mother, provokes him to &s;ay very ba&s;e and &s;candalous things again&s;t her. I live in daily terror le&s;t any of the&s;e reports &s;hould come round to Arundel's ears, who&s;e &s;pirit would not bear a word to be &s;aid again&s;t Lady G.</P>
<P>That gentleman has made his deb&ucirc;t in Par|liament by taking a decided part in Oppo&s;ition. I &s;hould make a lame &s;tory of it, if I were to attempt at giving you particulars, but I can a&s;&s;ure you the whole town rings with his ap|plau&s;es; and (what is wor&s;t of all) our mini|&s;ters <HI>lo&s;t their que&s;tion,</HI> as they call it, &s;o that I believe no que&s;tion now remains but they will lo&s;e their places. Every one of the junto are outrageous again&s;t my poor father for letting &s;uch a genius as Arundel &s;lip through his hands; and this, with the affair of my mo|ther, has opened all mouths violently again&s;t him, though I am per&s;uaded he feels his error poignantly enough, without any of the&s;e re|proaches to aggravate his regret.</P>
<P>The eloquence, the youth, the per&s;on of Arundel, who was known to &s;carce a mem|ber in the hou&s;e, had an a&s;toni&s;hing effect:
<PB N="254" REF="255">
juvenile orators have oftentimes come out with credit in a &s;et &s;peech, rehear&s;ed as it were by heart; but this new phaenomenon in Parliament was two hours in his reply to one of the be&s;t &s;peakers on the &s;ide of admini&s;tra|tion, by which he e&s;tabli&s;hed his reputation beyond all example.</P>
<P>As his affair with Sir George Revel has been greatly talked of, it intere&s;ted the atten|tion of the hou&s;e in an extraordinary degree, when that gentleman, who with all his mem|bers is come over to the mini&s;ter's &s;ide, ro&s;e as &s;oon as Arundel had &s;ate down, and under|took to reply to him; he began with &s;ome vehemence to retort upon him for the unhand|&s;ome part he was taking, appealing to the candor of the hou&s;e to judge if it was becom|ing for a man &s;o new in his &s;eat, and one who had been &s;o lately initiated, as an humble de|pendant on a noble lord high in office, into the privacy of his family, to avail him&s;elf of the intelligence he had gleaned (imperfectly as it appeared, but certainly not very honorably) in his &s;ervice, for the purpo&s;e of employing it again&s;t the very patron, who had admitted him into his confidence? That noble lord, he could
<PB N="255" REF="256">
&s;ay from his own knowledge, was intitled to a better return, as he had &s;hewn him&s;elf no le&s;s ready to be&s;tow favors than to forgive offen|ces, and though his bounty had not been ac|cepted, he humbly conceived it ought not to have been forgotten.</P>
<P>The gentleman, from who&s;e account I took down the&s;e particulars for your information, &s;aid the hou&s;e &s;eemed to feel the indelicacy of Sir George Revel's appeal, con&s;idering what had lately pa&s;&s;ed, and were very much di&s;|po&s;ed to interfere, and call him to order; but as &s;oon as Arundel took up his reply, in which he conducted him&s;elf with great coolne&s;s and di&s;cretion, the &s;ilence and attention were al|mo&s;t without precedent.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tifying him&s;elf from the charge of in|gratitude and double-dealing, he went through a manly, yet mode&s;t, detail of his own pro|ceedings during his connection with my father, and of the rea&s;ons which di&s;&s;olved it: the&s;e indeed he touched with great delicacy, yet opened as much as &s;ufficed very fully for his own vindication: when he came to &s;peak of the melancholy event, which had wrought &s;o
<PB N="256" REF="257">
great a change in his fortune and condition, all eyes were turned upon the venerable old General, who, though in the la&s;t &s;tage of in|firmity, and in deep mourning for an only &s;on, had &s;eated him&s;elf by his &s;ide; a &s;o|lemn murmur ran through the hou&s;e; every nerve &s;eemed to vibrate with the pa|thos of the &s;cene; the feeble veteran put his handkerchief to his eyes; the cri&s;is was too affecting; Arundel's voice trembled, &s;topt, he pau&s;ed awhile, and then re&s;uming his di&s;cour&s;e with greater energy, he broke forth into &s;o fine a flow of eloquence, awakened all the feelings of his hearers, and &s;truck the &s;trings of pity with &s;o ma&s;terly a hand, that decency could &s;carce re&s;train the hou&s;e from exclamations of applau&s;e. 'Twas then he turned his defence into attack, and made &s;o fierce a &s;ally into his opponent's quarters, that he rai&s;ed a general indignation again&s;t the very per&s;on, whom he had been accu&s;ed of being ungrateful to; he a&s;&s;erted, to the conviction of all, that &s;o far from betray|ing a benefactor, he had &s;uffered under an oppre&s;&s;or&mdash;that he could not abu&s;e a confi|dence he had never enjoyed&mdash;and that the
<PB N="257" REF="258">
offer he had refu&s;ed was the re&s;ult of fear, not favor, and would have been di&s;graceful to accept. But what was remarked parti|cularly to his credit was, that not a word of per&s;onality towards Sir George Revel e&s;caped from his lips; not a look that mark|ed contempt, not a &s;yllable that breathed de|fiance.</P>
<P>Thus you have the whole fairly tran|&s;cribed from a very correct Reporter, of what pa&s;&s;ed on that memorable debate, which was clo&s;ed with the &s;peech above related and fini&s;hed by a divi&s;ion, in which the ruling pow|ers were overthrown; a defeat, which I know enough of your politics, my dear Jane, to be|lieve you will not be very &s;orry for.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLI. Lady Loui&s;a G. to Lady Jane S.</HEAD>
<P>I Have at la&s;t peremptorily broke with Sir George Revel, and am free.</P>
<P>No penitent ever returned from ab&s;olution &s;o lightened in con&s;cience as I am by what I have done: I felt my&s;elf acting a part of du|plicity, which I mu&s;t take the liberty to &s;ay was a character entirely out of my ca&s;t, and of cour&s;e very awkwardly performed.</P>
<P>A fine man of Sir George's &s;ort, who looks upon the whole female world as drawn out in review for him in his imperial humour to throw his handkerchief to the cho&s;en fair, brooks the in&s;ult of a repul&s;e very ill. If he had not loved him&s;elf infinitely more than he did me, his di&s;appointment would have been intolera|ble; but as my opinion cannot lower him in his own, he &s;eemed rather to pity my bad ta&s;te than deplore his own hard fate.</P>
<P>On the evening of the day I la&s;t wrote to you I went to the Opera, and Sir George Re|vel,
<PB N="259" REF="260">
by privilege of cu&s;tom, came into my box; he was more than commonly trouble|&s;ome, and as my attention was particularly en|gro&s;&s;ed by a certain per&s;on in the pit, I was not in the be&s;t humour in the world: to con|fe&s;s the truth to you, that certain per&s;on was Arundel, who was &s;itting by old Lady Treville, and as it &s;eemed in earne&s;t conver&s;ation with her.</P>
<P>I had fixt my eyes upon him &s;o attentively, that Sir George, by following their direction, &s;oon di&s;covered the object at which they were pointed.</P>
<P>I perceive, &s;aid he, your Lady&s;hip has found out an acquaintance; you are looking at our new orator; but I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e you can find no great plea&s;ure in contemplating ingratitude, though at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>To this I made no an&s;wer, and he pro|ceeded.</P>
<P>The vanity of that fellow is in&s;ufferable; he comes here on purpo&s;e to be &s;tared at: but though curio&s;ity &s;hould draw every eye upon an up&s;tart novelty, your's at lea&s;t methinks &s;hould be averted from the foe-profe&s;&s;ed and &s;landerer of your father.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="261">As you have had a full reply to that already, I &s;uppo&s;e you do not expect one from me.</P>
<P>You need not put your lips to that trouble, Madam, I under&s;tand the language of your eyes.</P>
<P>Not always, Sir George.</P>
<P>When have I failed to interpret rightly?</P>
<P>In your own ca&s;e, as I &s;hould think.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand you perfectly, Madam; I can &s;ee the pa&s;&s;ion which prevails, when they are turned upon me, as I can di&s;cover that which animates them whil&s;t they are fixt upon him.</P>
<P>Hold, Sir George, one conclu&s;ion at a time, with your leave: be as confident as you plea&s;e in your own ca&s;e, but I de&s;ire you will make no conjectures for any other.</P>
<P>In my own ca&s;e then give me leave to tell you, Lady Loui&s;a, that if I have been hitherto in a deception as to the real language of your eyes, it is becau&s;e you have hitherto been plea&s;ed to conceal them under a ma&s;k; the in&s;tant that you conde&s;cend to take it off, and let them follow where the impul&s;e of your heart directs them, I no longer think the honor of being your admirer can compen&s;ate for the di&s;grace of being rival to your mother's footman.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="262">So &s;aying he flounced out of the box, and left me in a &s;tate of mind, in which it was hard to decide whether joy or indignation mo&s;t pre|ponderated. My agitation however was &s;o great between both, that I found my&s;elf una|ble to &s;it out the Opera, and, nobody being with me but Mrs. Courtenhall, I apologized to her for the di&s;order I was in and begged to go home.</P>
<P>An embarra&s;&s;ment now en&s;ued about get|ting up our carriage, as we had no gentleman to apply to; but depending upon what chance might throw in our way, we went down to the lobby to give orders for our &s;ervants to be called. Fortune, (whether in malice or good-will I cannot pretend to &s;ay) &s;o ordered it, that we &s;hould there encounter Mr. Arundel alone and going out of the hou&s;e. My di&s;|tre&s;s was vi&s;ible, and his embarra&s;&s;ment no le&s;s &s;o; he bowed with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect; ad|vanced, retired, then &s;topt as if uncertain what to do. His natural good manners at la&s;t de|cided in our favor, and he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me to know if I wanted any a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;would I command him to order up my carriage? I accepted his &s;ervice and he flew to fulfil it: a

very &s;hort time brought him back to tell me the coach was ready, and my &s;ervants in wait|ing.</P>
<P>May I have the honor of taking care of your Lady&s;hip, or am I impertinent?</P>
<P>That can hardly be, I replied, though they tell me I am in the enemy's hands. This I ac|companied with a &s;mile, as he was in the very act I alluded to.</P>
<P>Yes, Lady Loui&s;a, if he can be called an enemy, who would die in your defence.</P>
<P>I will not &s;wear to you, my &s;weet Jane, that whil&s;t he &s;poke the&s;e words he actually did pre&s;s my hand, but I thought he did, I felt as if he did; the flutter I had been in &s;eized me wor&s;e than ever; I tottered, lo&s;t my &s;ight and &s;carce had power to proceed. He certainly did not overlook my di&s;order, for he &s;upported me with the greate&s;t care, and &s;topping to give me time for recovery, with a look expre&s;&s;ive of the tendere&s;t re&s;pect, whi&s;pered to me&mdash;Alas! you are ill; if enemies feel what I feel, how can your friends &s;urvive it?&mdash;As you have never heard his voice, Jane, you cannot judge of its effect; I will not attempt at the de&s;cription of it: my heart was full; it was

<P>He obeyed me, but how I know not; he conducted me through the crowd, put me into the coach, placed my companion by my &s;ide, and we parted without another word.</P>

<P>ANOTHER letter, I hear you &s;ay!&mdash;Yes, another&mdash;<HI>for I mu&s;t write and you mu&s;t read.</HI></P>
<P>Lady Treville has been with me; &s;he is a dear, old, generous, con&s;iderate creature, a friend to love, and, like <HI>Hope,</HI>
<Q>A nur&s;e of young de&s;ire.</Q>
I doat upon her to di&s;traction, for I am &s;ure &s;he came upon an errand from Arundel this morning, to enquire after my health: &s;he had heard I went home ill from the Opera la&s;t night.</P>
<P>This good lady, as you well know, has a fine hou&s;e, a great fortune, high birth and much vivacity; &s;he keeps a circle, which is greatly frequented by the fine young men about town, particularly by the leaders of that party, which is termed the Oppo&s;ition. Arun|del is her prime favorite, and I under&s;tand is

<P>Of me! I replied, methinks I &s;hould be cu|rious to know what Mr. Arundel is plea&s;ed to commend in me.</P>
<P>Now I dare &s;ay, an&s;wered Lady Treville, you are prepared to hear a great many compli|ments pa&s;&s;ed upon your beauty, but I mu&s;t mortify your expectations by telling you his encomiums were all directed another way, which perhaps you may hold to be a great &s;o|leci&s;m in politene&s;s.</P>
<P>Pardon me, my good Lady, that is not my way of thinking. Well then, &s;aid &s;he with a &s;mile, you can well believe that bu&s;y people will be meddling with affairs they have no con|cern in; and as a certain Sir George Revel, whom all the ladies think &s;o great a catch, has circulated your refu&s;al of him pretty generally, there will be different ways of talking about it.

<P>Dear madam, there is no need of &s;oftening the truth to me: I dare &s;ay I was &s;oundly abu&s;ed by &s;ome kind &s;oul or other as the arrante&s;t jilt in the kingdom.</P>
<P>Not &s;o bad as that, Lady Loui&s;a; enough however to draw out the hand&s;ome&s;t defence from Mr. Arundel I ever heard: defence do I call it? it was a panegyric, that made every female cheek in the room burn with envy; it put malice quite out of countenance, I can a&s;|&s;ure you, and was followed by a &s;ilence, which nobody &s;eemed hardy enough to interrupt.</P>
<P>At la&s;t a grave old gentleman ob&s;erved, that it was as hopele&s;s to convict Lady Loui&s;a be|fore &s;uch an advocate, as it was to defend Lord G. again&s;t &s;uch an opponent.</P>
<P>One of the company ob&s;erved to me in a whi&s;per, that the young lady had probably re|venged her father's quarrel, intimating that you, my dear, had made Arundel's heart atone for what Lord G.'s had felt.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="268">Now this was an ob&s;ervation I could neither &s;ay yea nor nay to till I had con&s;ulted you; but if you will give me an an&s;wer upon your authority, I will be faithful in applying it.</P>
<P>But is it nece&s;&s;ary, I demanded, that an an|&s;wer &s;hould be given? and if it &s;hould, does it not rather re&s;t with Mr. Arundel than with me? Is not he better able to judge of the &s;tate of his own heart than I am for him? If you wi&s;h to know the truth, my dear lady, had not you better &s;eek it from the fountain-head?</P>
<P>Oh Heavens! &s;he cried, if he dared to tell me that he was in love with any woman but my&s;elf, I would tear his eyes out. I caught him looking at you at the Opera, and I &s;ent him away with &s;uch a lecture, as he will not &s;oon forget: I do not know whether I &s;hall let him into my hou&s;e this evening, though I have a little private party of mu&s;ic and &s;hall want his violin; now I was thinking, if your Lady|&s;hip will honor me with your a&s;&s;i&s;tance at the harp&s;ichord, we will &s;end him about his bu&s;i|ne&s;s and &s;hew him that we can do without him.</P>
<P>I fancy I &s;hould be an unwelcome vi&s;itor upon tho&s;e terms; you would find me a bad
<PB N="268" REF="269">
&s;ub&s;titute for &s;o fine a performer; but as I am per&s;uaded your Lady&s;hip has no rea&s;on to fear any rival, and me perhaps lea&s;t of any, had not you better let him in?</P>
<P>Then be it &s;o! and if he dares to look a&s;ide, tru&s;t me for finding him out; nothing is &s;o &s;harp-&s;ighted as jealou&s;y.&mdash;But remember to come and bring all your charms with you, youth, beauty, love and harmony; if I triumph over the&s;e, my glory will be great indeed.</P>
<P>With the&s;e words &s;he &s;tarted up with all the vivacity of a girl, and taking me by the hand as &s;he left the room, cried out, God ble&s;s you, my dear Lady, I adore you for your behavior to Sir George Revel; there is but one man living, who de&s;erves you.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Jane, I leave you a puz|zle to amu&s;e your&s;elf with gue&s;&s;ing at&mdash;Do I go, or do I not go?&mdash;<HI>that is the que&s;tion.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII. Lady Jane S. to Lady Loui&s;a G.</HEAD>
<P>HOW can you be &s;o non&s;en&s;ical a chit? <HI>Do you go, or do you not go to Lady Treville's? that is the que&s;tion</HI> indeed! No, child, that is not the que&s;tion which I &s;hall an&s;wer, for it an&s;wers it&s;elf. You will not &s;top at Lady Treville's, when you are once &s;et a-going, if I have any gue&s;s at your motions: you will have a longer journey on your hands before you are much older; for that <HI>promotion,</HI> which we are told <HI>cometh neither from the Ea&s;t, nor from the We&s;t, nor yet from the South,</HI> can of cour&s;e be found no where but in the North, and thither you will go in &s;earch of it. I have heard it &s;aid there is an old black&s;mith, &s;omewhere on the borders of Scotland, who, though but a &s;ooty fellow, is in great vogue for his work|man&s;hip, and much re&s;orted to for a particular kind of chains, which I think would &s;uit your Lady&s;hip's ta&s;te to a tittle, and perhaps la&s;t you to the end of your life. Now if your
<PB N="270" REF="271">
my pretty Loui&s;a, would pay this &s;ame black|&s;mith a vi&s;it, it would be realizing the old fu&s;ty fable of Venus and Vulcan; and, to pre|vent mi&s;takes, you may take your Aeneas in your hand, and let his armour be fitted upon him in the &s;hop: I warrant it will then &s;it clo&s;e to him.</P>
<P>Well! and how did my dear Arundel look at Lady Treville's, what did he &s;ay and how did he fiddle? I find he draws a &s;trong bow, as my poor Lord G. can witne&s;s. I adore him for his politics, for I am oppo&s;ition mad; in &s;hort, my dear, we of this hou&s;e are poor and hungry, and I do from my heart hope that Arundel will help to &s;moak out all the hive, and let us in for a &s;hare of the honey. I would venture a good wager, Loui&s;a, that at this very time of writing you are one of us. What a happy faculty the&s;e young reformers have at converting us maiden pupils to their opinions! the wi&s;dom of the aged is but loft upon us; it goes for nothing.</P>
<P>And &s;o you have had the a&s;&s;urance to refu&s;e a lover, whom all the marrying world are pull|ing caps for; and who but you could with&s;tand being the fine&s;t, gaye&s;t, riche&s;t bride in Eng|land?
<PB N="271" REF="272">
To be &s;ure there are a few flaws in Sir George's character, a few trifling blemi&s;hes, &s;uch as pride, ill-nature, in&s;olence, a &s;mall propen&s;ity to the brute, and no want of par|tiality for dear &s;elf: but who &s;tumbles at &s;traws? and every Mi&s;s in the kingdom knows, that if her hu&s;band will not make her happy, &s;omebody el&s;e will: there is always &s;ome kind-hearted creature ready to take pity upon di&s;con&s;olate wives, if they are willing to make their &s;orrows known. It is my opinion then Sir George will never meet a &s;econd rebuff, unle&s;s he would conde&s;cend to ca&s;t the eyes of his regard upon me; oh! that his proud &s;to|mach would come down &s;o low! Marry! if a poor Scotti&s;h la&s;&s;ie like me was to &s;end him packing, it would break the neck of his pride at once; now you can only break his heart: honor enough for him that he may boa&s;t of having thrown him&s;elf at your feet, though he has been to&s;&s;ed out of window for his teme|rity.</P>
<P>Fie upon it! where am I &s;crambling out of windows? The thought of your dear mother meets me by the way, and rebukes my idle &s;pirit for its levity. When I think of her, my
<PB N="272" REF="273">
heavy heart is like poor king John's in the tragedy&mdash;
<Q>It will not out of <HI>windows</HI> or of doors.</Q>
Oh that I was with her in her &s;olitude! tell her, I be&s;eech you, if &s;he wants a tame crea|ture to run about the hou&s;e, and be faithful to her, I am at her &s;ervice. I can hold my tongue when &s;he does not wi&s;h to hear me talk, and I am too much my own friend not to be &s;ilent when &s;he &s;peaks: on this &s;ide ido|latry I have ever loved her more than any other woman, but when &s;he was a great Lady, I forbore to make my court to her, as I now wi&s;h to do in the <HI>decadence</HI> of her fortune. Oh Arundel, how I love thee for thy gratitude and devotion to the charming Lady G.! Lend me but thy Ce&s;tus, my &s;weet Loui&s;a, if thou ha&s;t no employment for it thy&s;elf, and I will level all my borrowed charms at the heart of that dear darling fellow, and &s;ave him a trip to the black&s;mith, for there is not one of my poor kinsfolk, but will to&s;s their Scotch bonnets in the air for joy at my good luck: I warrant him they will &s;et the pipes a &s;queaking, when he comes to Fergus Ca&s;tle. In the mean time
<PB N="273" REF="274">
here I live without a lover, or even an ac|quaintance, except one &s;olitary tree that &s;tands now in my eye from the ca&s;tle ca&s;ement, the only ornament of the pro&s;pect; with whom I have made a friend&s;hip, as there is a kind of &s;ympathy in our &s;ituations, being both left naked and alone in the wide world; both planted in a bleak and barren &s;oil, and alike un&s;heltered and expo&s;ed to all the bla&s;ts of Heaven: I vi&s;it it every day, and as I &s;tand &s;ighing under its branches, the kind creature an&s;wers me with a melancholy murmur, and ru&s;tles every leaf in token of its fellow-feel|ing. It is the very emblem of celibacy, for if I was to climb to the top of it I am &s;ure I could not &s;py out a companion within the range of vi&s;ion; it &s;tands like Jephtha's daugh|ter, bewailing its virginity upon the moun|tains, and being of the ever-green race has the property in common with other old maids of never changing its condition.

On each &s;ide of this throne are two go|thic arches, both which in better days were complimented with doors, but one only en|joys that di&s;tinction at pre&s;ent, and this deli|vers you into a great chamber, which we, by courte&s;y, call habitable, and &s;o it is more properly by contra&s;t, for here my venerable ance&s;tors hang by the wall with their names and &s;exes very con&s;iderately told by the pain|ter, who would el&s;e have bequeathed a riddle to po&s;terity too difficult for us to expound.

Wonder not if I adore the name of Arundel, when it is the brave John Arun|del, uncle of your Francis, who is the gallant comrade I allude to; with this veteran my bro|ther is now crui&s;ing; under him he has been trained from a child; he it is who has edu|cated, fathered, and befriended him; under his command he is now &s;ailing, the di&s;ciple in a frigate, the ma&s;ter in a line of battle &s;hip; by his &s;ide perhaps he is fighting.

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV. Arundel to the Counte&s;s of G.</HEAD>
<P>AS your Lady&s;hip's great kindne&s;s has given me a claim upon you for advice in any difficulties, I beg leave now to re&s;ort to you for your judgment in a ca&s;e, than which no|thing can be more intere&s;ting to my feelings, at the &s;ame time that I am doubtful how I ought to act in it with all becoming delicacy towards the party concerned.</P>
<P>There is a lady of high rank, to whom I am under the greate&s;t obligations, and for whom my heart entertains every re&s;pectful &s;entiment of e&s;teem and gratitude, now in a very pecu|liar &s;ituation, having been exiled from her hou&s;e and family by the tyranny of her Lord, and living in a retired and &s;olitary cottage on the &s;ea-coa&s;t without a friend or companion with her, and &s;olaced only by tho&s;e con&s;cious reflections, which the unblemi&s;hed rectitude of
<PB N="277" REF="278">
her own virtuous conduct may &s;ugge&s;t for her relief and comfort.</P>
<P>A heart, that overflows for the unmerited &s;ufferings of this amiable exile, prompts me to expre&s;s to her the &s;en&s;ibility, with which it is penetrated in her behalf; and to attempt at telling her, (if words could tell what it feels) how entirely it is devoted to her&mdash;but alas! I am doubtful if I ought to do this, and am afraid le&s;t the delicacy of her &s;oul might re&s;ent the intru&s;ion of my officious zeal upon the &s;acred privacy of her retirement.</P>
<P>You, Madam, to whom all the&s;e fine feel|ings are pre&s;ent, will inform me how to act; and, that you may po&s;&s;e&s;s your&s;elf of the ca&s;e in all its circum&s;tances, I be&s;eech of you to put your&s;elf in the predicament of the lady I de|&s;cribe, and, crediting me for what I profe&s;s, and even more than I can profe&s;s, an&s;wer as in her per&s;on, and direct my doubtful judg|ment how to proceed.</P>
<P>If there was a thing within the compa&s;s of my faculties to attempt, if there was a &s;ervice to be undertaken for her &s;ake, though it in|volved the &s;acrifice of my life, I have zeal and

<P>ALAS! my dear Jane, the hope that gleamed upon my pro&s;pect, how &s;ud|denly is it overca&s;t!</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Lady Treville left me, than my father came into my room: for &s;ome days I had &s;carce exchanged a word with him, and whenever we met he appeared &s;ullen, dull and out of &s;pirits.

<P>His countenance very &s;ufficiently indicated that I was to encounter his di&s;plea&s;ure; but when I expected it to break forth, as u&s;ual with him, in &s;ome &s;udden gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;at deliberately down, and without any eleva|tion of voice, began by telling me, that my conduct towards Sir George Revel had at la&s;t

put it out of all doubt that I was in league again&s;t him with my mother, and that viper (meaning Arundel), whom he had fo&s;tered in his bo&s;om. Yes, added he, ingrateful child, whom I have &s;o fooli&s;hly doated on, it is not in the nature of things to &s;uppo&s;e you would have refu&s;ed a match, &s;o de&s;ireable in it&s;elf, and &s;o much the object of my wi&s;hes, had you not been combined with tho&s;e incendiaries under my own roof in a plot again&s;t my honor, hap|pine&s;s and intere&s;t. Could you be &s;o blind as not to &s;ee your mother's glaring partiality for that fellow Arundel? Did &s;he not employ him as her in&s;trument in the fir&s;t place to af|front Sir George, and when the quarrel did not terminate to her wi&s;h, but her runner got cha&s;ti&s;ed for his in&s;olence, &s;he caballed with him for traver&s;ing my mea&s;ures, and turning your affections from their natural bent in his favor to an ab&s;olute rejection of him? Who but &s;he in&s;pired her favorite with tho&s;e pre|&s;umptuous notions of him&s;elf, which broke out with &s;uch in&s;olence upon our la&s;t inter|view in this hou&s;e, &s;o that when I calmly took him to ta&s;k for his officiou&s;ne&s;s in my family affairs, he an&s;wered me in &s;uch a &s;tile, that I

Nay, I can well be|lieve that &s;he is capable of furni&s;hing him with hints and heads for his abu&s;ive, virulent Philippic; for where &s;hould he di&s;cover or in|vent matter for his calumny? and how &s;hould a raw academic &s;tart up at once a politician and declaimer, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;uch mi&s;chief-making meddler had been at work to tutor him in the trade?

Take notice al&s;o, that you had not then declared your&s;elf again&s;t Sir George Revel; nay, I had every rea&s;on to believe you meant to comply with his wi&s;hes and mine, by giving him your hand. Did you not encourage this delu&s;ion? and do you &s;uppo&s;e any father can continue to repo&s;e the &s;ame confidence or affection in a daughter, who repays his kindne&s;s and betrays his tru&s;t by &s;eizing the very fir&s;t occa&s;ion for thwarting all his hopes and projects for her happine&s;s?

no means left for appea&s;ing your di&s;plea&s;ure but by &s;acrificing my own happine&s;s? No hope of reconciling you to my unhappy mo|ther but by devoting my&s;elf before the altar with lying lips and a revolting heart? Mu&s;t I never embrace a beloved parent till I join hands with him who is of all men my aver|&s;ion? never be permitted to &s;peak comfort to her affliction, till I pronounce the fatal word, that &s;entences me to mi&s;ery, perhaps to guilt, for ever? Is this my choice of horrors? Are the&s;e the allotted portions of wretchedne&s;s, from which I am now commanded to elect my doom for life?</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed awhile, and looked me &s;ternly in the face&mdash;then recollecting him&s;elf, taunt|ingly replied&mdash;Your imagination, Madam, may fill both &s;ides of the picture with horrors; I conceive they exi&s;t only on the rever&s;e of that which it is your duty to chu&s;e: I am &s;a|tisfied I propo&s;e a gentleman who will make you happy; you may have a wretch in your eye, whom I hold in my aver&s;ion, therefore it behoves me to be peremptory: I don't wi&s;h to be amu&s;ed by eloquence and declamation, I

de&s;ire only to be an&s;wered with &s;incerity and truth.</P>
<P>Then, my Lord, I re&s;ign into your hands that life, which under God you gave me; I devote my&s;elf to death, the la&s;t re&s;ource of human mi&s;ery. When you have thus di&s;po&s;ed of my mother and my&s;elf, you will have exe|cuted the full powers of a hu&s;band and a father.</P>
<P>Whether he was alarmed at the agony with which I uttered the&s;e words, or awakened by &s;ome &s;tings of con&s;cience at the conclu&s;ion of them, I cannot pretend to determine, but he took me gently by the hand, and in a low voice &s;aid&mdash;Be comforted, Loui&s;a; I am your father &s;till, and cannot forget to love you; but regard me as a father, and enable me to fulfil the promi&s;e by which I have bound my&s;elf to Sir George Revel: do not compel me to break the word which I have given him, that he &s;hall at lea&s;t be admitted to re|new his addre&s;&s;es to you: if I cannot prevail with my child to give him her con&s;ent, give him at lea&s;t a hearing at my reque&s;t; &s;urely you will not refu&s;e that to a father: and in

the mean time I tru&s;t you will pledge your honor to me not to conver&s;e, corre&s;pond with, or (if that can be prevented) even to &s;ee Mr. Arundel. Are the&s;e unrea&s;onable requi&s;itions, Loui&s;a? will you not grant this moderate re|que&s;t to your father?</P>
<P>I were inexcu&s;able if I did not promi&s;e you to fulfil every one of the&s;e conditions mo&s;t re|ligiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Then retire to your chamber, my dear, he replied, compo&s;e your &s;pirits, and be a&s;&s;ured I have no other wi&s;h in life but to make you happy.</P>
<P>Thus ended a conver&s;ation, painful through its whole progre&s;s, though the violence it commenced with was in &s;ome degree &s;oftened at the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e irk&s;ome conditions mu&s;t be ob&s;erved. I &s;hall &s;end an apology to Lady Treville.</P>
<P>Oh my Jane, if I were now &s;tanding under thy &s;olitary tree, in the bleake&s;t wind that ever &s;hook its weather-beaten branches, I could, &s;o Arundel were by my &s;ide,

<P>IT is now in my power to inform you, that the old incumbent of Packington is dead, and the pre&s;entation to that living waits your acceptance.

<P>BY no means, my ever honored and beloved Lady, admit the vi&s;it of Arundel.</P>
<P>Events have come to pa&s;s in your family, which perhaps you are not yet apprized of. Lady Loui&s;a has ab&s;olutely di&s;carded Sir George Revel; &s;he has had a ca&s;ual interview with Arundel at the Opera, this I learn from Go&s;&s;ip Report, alias old Lady Treville: I am going to her party this night; I am to take up your daughter in my way, and I al&s;o know that Arundel will be there.&mdash;Mu&s;ic is the pretence, but take my word for it, love is at the bottom of it. It is creeping into the world, nay it has already crept.</P>
<P>Need I add another word? It would be an in&s;ult to your delicacy, to your di&s;cretion, to your maternal feeling. I leave it with your own excellent heart to decide.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER L. The Counte&s;s of G. to the Hon. Mrs. Dormer.</HEAD>
<P>NOT for the earth would I admit of a vi&s;it from Arundel. I will put that mi&s;chief beyond the reach of chance or temptation. I will leave the kingdom immediately.</P>
<P>Strange as it may appear, yet I give you my honor it is true, that until I came to this place I did not know Sir Francis Arundel has a family &s;eat in this country, and as I am now informed not many miles from the hou&s;e I am in. Whether this would or would not have been a motive with me for coming hither, when I had a retirement to chu&s;e, is a que&s;tion I will not a&s;k of my&s;elf, let it &s;uffice that it is now become no que&s;tion at all, but downright fate and nece&s;&s;ity that I mu&s;t fly from it forth|with.</P>
<P>Oh horrible! what terrors ru&s;h upon my mind of dangers narrowly e&s;caped, temptations ra&s;hly encountered, deliverances providentially vouch&s;afed!</P>
<P>You have now redeemed all former errors; your la&s;t letter has inclo&s;ed an antidote for the
<PB N="295" REF="296">
poi&s;on, which your fir&s;t contained. The ope|ration has been &s;evere, but the cure is radical; the cau&s;tic has penetrated to my heart, but the canker, which would have con&s;umed it, is it|&s;elf con&s;umed: you have &s;aved me; you have &s;aved your&s;elf, and atoned to virtue.</P>
<P>Why did not my Loui&s;a confide to me the very fir&s;t approaches of her pa&s;&s;ion? How was it that I did not di&s;cover them? Where was my intuition?&mdash;Ah! where indeed? di|verted, mi&s;applied, engro&s;&s;ed by treacherous propen&s;ities, blind leaders of the blind.</P>
<P>The affair of Sir George Revel is not new to me; what relates to Arundel is unexpected; but when I recall pa&s;t circum&s;tances to my memory, I &s;ee clearly many things by retro|&s;pection, which e&s;caped unnoticed at the time; and I am convinced that the impre&s;&s;ion was given, and has been deepening, from their very fir&s;t interview.</P>
<P>Oh my Loui&s;a, my child, what a &s;cene of difficulties is now opening upon thee! what fury wilt thou have to encounter from my Lord, what malice, what re&s;entment from Sir George! Now who &s;hall prevent a mortal encounter between Arundel and his rival?</P>
<P>Can you wonder if I fly from the world, if
<PB N="296" REF="297">
I hide my&s;elf from the&s;e approaching terrors, helple&s;s as I am, and alike incapable either to prevent them coming, or meet them when they come? No, my good friend, let me &s;ink into oblivious &s;olitude, let me &s;teer my feeble bark out of the &s;tream of this overwhelming torrent. May Heaven direct, pre&s;erve and ble&s;s my child! May &s;he be happy in the arms of Arundel! May I repo&s;e my&s;elf in &s;ecrecy and retirement.</P>
<P>I have formed my plan, and &s;hall not lo&s;e a moment in preparing for it: when I am arriv|ed at the place of my de&s;tination I &s;hall write to you; but as I mean to keep it private from all but you, even from my daughter her&s;elf and Arundel above all, I mu&s;t conjure you in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner never to divulge my &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Time may bring all things round; if Pro|vidence befriends my child and &s;he is happy with her Arundel, then I will come forth and claim participation in the ble&s;&s;ing: if not, death is my a&s;ylum; I &s;ink unnoticed into the forgetful grave.</P>
