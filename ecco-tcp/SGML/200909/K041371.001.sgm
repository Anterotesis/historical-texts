<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG all the agreeable and in|tere&s;ting &s;ciences, the mo&s;t culti|vated, and the lea&s;t improved, is certain|ly that of Man. How many &s;y&s;tems have been invented! How many volumes writ|ten upon this &s;ubject! And what a multi|tude of ab&s;urdities involve the few truths that have been publi&s;hed thereon!</P>
<P>Let us take a cur&s;ory view of the hi&s;to|ry of this part of human knowledge. Since men fir&s;t entered on the &s;tudy of na|ture, Man has been the particular object of their enquiries. A &s;ubject &s;o noble and &s;o intere&s;ting, was too important not to engage their chief attention. But as they were de&s;titute of every light, their knowledge of Man, as of the re&s;t of the univer&s;e, was confined to a few &s;uperficial and imperfect ob&s;ervations. The fir&s;t, who made Man their &s;tudy, undoubtedly believed him to be wholly corporeal; and they who &s;ucceeded, rather gue&s;&s;ed, than demon&s;trated, that &s;ome other &s;ub&s;tance, be&s;ides the body, entered into the compo|&s;ition
<PB N="iv" REF="6">of his being. Mankind had then made no curious di&s;qui&s;itions in &s;cience; they knew but very little of things; and metaphy&s;ical knowledge, then in its dawn, could not &s;upply tho&s;e profound and &s;ubtil arguments, which &s;ome modern philo&s;ophers have employed, to prove that Man is not wholly material. This profound ignorance of the fir&s;t age was likewi&s;e the lot of the &s;ub&s;equent, and men, for a long time, only &s;u&s;pected they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;oul, &s;o far were they from be|ing able to convince them&s;elves of its ex|i&s;tence, and &s;o entirely ignorant of its na|ture. But let us pa&s;s over tho&s;e dark and unknown ages, and de&s;cend to more en|lightened times.</P>
<P>In Greece, that nur&s;ery of the arts and &s;ciences, where the faculties of the mind were &s;o amazingly improved in various branches of knowledge; philo&s;ophers were continually di&s;cour&s;ing of &s;oul and &s;pirit, but without annexing to the&s;e terms any idea of &s;pirituality. The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed, as Ari&s;totle, Socrates, Pla|to, Diogenes, Epicurus, agreed in affirm|ing the &s;oul to be a &s;pirit; but this &s;pirit was believed by all to be a thin &s;ubtil mat|ter.
<PB N="v" REF="7">Thus, for want of accurate ob&s;er|tions, philo&s;ophers were &s;topped &s;hort in their fir&s;t attempt, and all their know|ledge was confined, like that of the herd of mankind, to the di&s;tingui&s;hing their own &s;pecies from that of brutes, by the configuration of the body.</P>
<P>In proce&s;s of time, philo&s;ophers made farther re&s;earches, but without rule, and without any principles to guide them: in|&s;tead of previou&s;ly examining what they were de&s;irous to know, they began with defining the matter of which they as yet had no idea; a&s;toni&s;hed at the phenomena of the human mind, they repre&s;ented Man rather after their own imagination, than after nature. Some doubted whether they &s;hould not exalt him to the condition of a god; whil&s;t others were for degrading him to a &s;tate inferior to the bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Time, which produces &s;uch revolutions in opinions, wrought no great altera|tion; and the &s;cience of Man, in pa&s;&s;ing from one country to another, carried all its errors along with it, without acquiring any new truth.</P>
<P>The Grecian philo&s;ophers under&s;tood Man no better than their ma&s;ters, the Egyp|tians;
<PB N="vi" REF="8">nor were the acquirements of the Romans, in this &s;cience, greater than tho&s;e of the Greeks, notwith&s;tanding the many fine things written by <HI>Cicero, Seneca,</HI> and others florid writers on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t they knew not Man, and after|wards could not. Prie&s;ts who, from a principle of &s;elf intere&s;t, have ever made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to mi&s;lead mankind, and, in the name of the Gods, to &s;anctify ig|norance and error, feigned many ab&s;urd tales concerning Man, his gene&s;is, his na|ture, and the end of his creation. From that time, the chimeras of fable were in|termixed with the feeble lights of philo&s;o|phy, already too much involved in error. And Man was believed to have been form|ed <HI>after the image of the gods,</HI> and <HI>his &s;oul</HI> to be <HI>a particle of the divine nature.</HI> The age of ignorance was of very long dura|tion. Darkne&s;s increa&s;ed and fables were multiplied. Hence Man, thus bewildered and en&s;laved to tho&s;e heavenly bugbears, had not even a de&s;ire to know him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time &s;ince, &s;ome philo&s;ophers, a&s;hamed of &s;o di&s;honourable a &s;ervitude, tore off the bandage with which &s;uper&s;tition had ob&s;tructed their &s;ight, and turned
<PB N="vii" REF="9">their eyes inwards on them&s;elves. But, as the &s;cience of Man was intricate and my&s;terious, to recover it from that dark|ne&s;s in which it was then involved, it was nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to ob&s;ervation. They therefore contemplated Man, but contemplated him imperfectly. Many afterwards publi&s;hed their thoughts upon this &s;ubject; thoughts altogether frivolous and vain, and which might, for the mo&s;t part, be reduced to &s;ome trivial maxims.</P>
<P>The &s;cience of Man, hitherto treated in a vague and too general manner, was now re&s;olved into its con&s;tituent parts. The&s;e were divided and &s;tudied &s;eparately. Ana|tomi&s;ts examined the corporeal, and phi|lo&s;ophers, the &s;piritual part: Philo&s;ophers di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;entiment from thought, made them two &s;eparate &s;ciences, the know|ledge of the mind or intellect, and the knowledge of the heart or affections, and divided the two provinces betwixt them. Metaphy&s;icians appropriated the former, and moral philo&s;ophers the other.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who have be&s;t &s;ucceeded in the&s;e different branches, are Locke, Rochefoucault, and Win&s;low.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="10">Rochefoucault has examined the pa&s;&s;ions of the human heart, and has di&s;played their nature and principles indifferently well.</P>
<P>Locke has treated of the mental facul|ties, and has well inve&s;tigated them.</P>
<P>Win&s;low has con&s;idered the phy&s;ical part, and has handled it much better than the others have the &s;piritual.</P>
<P>Accordingly modern philo&s;ophers have &s;ucceeded better than the ancient. But their ob&s;ervations being made by men who&s;e talents and pur&s;uits were different; by metaphy&s;icians who were not anato|mi&s;ts, and by anatomi&s;ts who were not metaphy&s;icians; the&s;e were therefore un|connected, and the &s;cience of Man con|&s;i&s;ted wholly in a number of &s;cattered ideas. Accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider the phe|nomena independent of their mutual con|nection, they, who applied them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of this &s;cience, perceived not the cau&s;es of the reciprocal influence of the &s;oul on the body, and even the rela|tions between the&s;e two &s;ub&s;tances, almo&s;t entirely e&s;caped their ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s much had been already done; but the chief difficulty yet remained to be overcome. The faculties of the
<PB N="ix" REF="11">&s;oul, and the mechani&s;m of the body were known, but not the whole Man as com|pounded of both. No one had yet ac|counted for the &s;ingular relations between the two &s;ub&s;tances which compo&s;e his being; &s;carce any one had noticed their wonderful influence on each other.</P>
<P>Man therefore was con&s;idered as an enigma, as an impenetrable my&s;tery. Phi|lophers, poets, orators, all expatiated on that contra&s;t of meanne&s;s and greatne&s;s; that medley of folly and wi&s;dom; tho&s;e &s;udden changes; tho&s;e perpetual revolu|tions in the &s;oul, which offer them&s;elves to every ones ob&s;ervation, in&s;tead of at|tempting to inve&s;tigate them and to di&s;co|ver their cau&s;es. But this work was not ea&s;y to be performed. To render the&s;e phenomena more marvellous, it was &s;uffi|cient to &s;elect &s;ome contra&s;ting and &s;eem|ingly incon&s;i&s;tent &s;ituations. To elucidate them, it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tudy Man; to &s;ee him in every circum&s;tance; to ob|&s;erve carefully the reciprocal influence of the phy&s;ical on the moral part, and to di&s;|cover the rea&s;on of this influence.</P>
<P>This &s;tudy &s;eems to have been re&s;erved for phy&s;icians, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion qualifies
<PB N="x" REF="12">them for making &s;uch ob&s;ervations; and who, being called to relieve the &s;ufferings of mankind, can contemplate the &s;oul in all its various &s;ituations, and &s;urprize it, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, in every degree of mi&s;ery or greatne&s;s. Ac|cordingly phy&s;icians were the fir&s;t who dared to enter upon this intricate &s;cience. Philo&s;ophers followed their example. Every one formed his ob&s;ervations &s;e|parately; but as they had not gained a &s;ufficient number of principles, and did not unite the di&s;coveries of the ana|tomi&s;t with tho&s;e of the metaphy&s;ici|ans, they made but few, and tho&s;e ve|ry trivial ob&s;ervations. The &s;pirit of &s;y&s;|tem afterwards &s;pread its dark veil over this dawn of knowledge, and the philo|&s;ophers of that age fell into the &s;ame er|rors with their predece&s;&s;ors. Before they had made a &s;ufficient number of proper ob&s;ervations, they attempted to account for tho&s;e phenomena which they ob&s;erved, and by the little they knew, gue&s;&s;ed the re&s;t; they built &s;y&s;tems, and in&s;tead of deducing them from their ob&s;ervation, they wre&s;ted their ob&s;ervations to quadrate with their &s;y&s;tems. One endeavoured to
<PB N="xi" REF="13">explain every thing by phy&s;ical, another by moral cau&s;es, and every one, for want of having comprehended the whole, and by being wholly confined within the nar|row limits of his own knowledge, was con|&s;trained to treat this &s;ubject in a vague in|determinate manner, and to explain the phe|nomena by imaginary relations and by ridi|culous hypothe&s;es: &s;o that whil&s;t they be|lieved them&s;elves &s;ure of having attained <HI>Truth</HI> in one in&s;tance, it e&s;caped them in many others. Among the&s;e philo&s;o|phers, &s;ome de&s;irous to pa&s;s for men of wit, &s;acrificed truth to brilliancy of thought, and good &s;en&s;e to elegancy of expre&s;&s;ion. Thus, of their &s;y&s;tems, &s;ome were ab&s;urd, others imperfect, and all ra|ther &s;ingular than ju&s;t. But as my bare a&s;&s;erting the&s;e facts will not &s;uffice, I pro|ceed to offer the proofs of them.</P>
<P><HI>Galen,</HI> and before him <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> ob&s;erved &s;ome phenomena concerning the reciprocal influence of the body on the &s;oul, but be|lieved the &s;oul to be material; whence their ob&s;ervations are but little worth.</P>
<P><HI>Montagne</HI> in his E&s;&s;ays, <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas Robin&s;on.</NOTE><HI>Boer|have</HI> and <HI>Hoffman</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Frederic Hoffman the younger.</NOTE>, have left a few ob|&s;ervations
<PB N="xii" REF="14">on the reciprocal influence of the body and the &s;oul; their views, how|ever, were very confined, nor has any of them attempted to elucidate the&s;e pheno|mena.</P>
<P><HI>Des Cartes</HI> was the fir&s;t who undertook the ta&s;k; but as his anatomical knowledge was very imperfect, and his metaphy&s;ical notions erroneous, he fell greatly &s;hort of his aim. He fir&s;t confounded the im|pre&s;&s;ions of external objects on the &s;en&s;es with the ideas of the mind, and then made the different affections of the &s;oul to con&s;i&s;t in modifications of the animal &s;pirits; he a&s;&s;igned different parts of the head for the &s;eat of the different mental faculties, and allotted to every idea a par|ticular tube of the brain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his work intitled <HI>L'homme,</HI> Lib. 4.</NOTE>. From the action of the&s;e &s;pirits, differently modifi|ed, on the different organs, he accounted for every operation of the &s;oul, viz. thought, judgment, good &s;en&s;e, imagination, me|mory, and remembrance. Finally, from the different motions of the&s;e &s;pirits, he deduced the order or the confu&s;ion of our ideas. Thus ever hurried along by a warm imagination, in&s;tead of explaining the
<PB N="xiii" REF="15">phenomena of nature, he has given only idle dreams, and contented him&s;elf with empty notions.</P>
<P>To <HI>Des Cartes</HI> &s;ucceeded <HI>La Metrie,</HI> in a &s;mall work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Intitled</HI> L'homme Phy&s;ique.</NOTE>, the de&s;ign of which is not ea&s;ily di&s;covered. Notwith&s;tanding his learning, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he might have received from his profe&s;&s;ion, he appears to have ob&s;erved nature not as a philo&s;o|pher, but as an illiterate man. Almo&s;t always led a&s;tray by appearances, he pe|netrated no farther than the &s;urface in &s;earch of truth; &s;o that if we reduce his book, which has been &s;o highly commended by athei&s;ts, to its ju&s;t value, it will be found to be a &s;orry collection of trivial ob&s;erva|tions, and of fal&s;e metaphy&s;ical rea&s;onings on the &s;oul and its faculties; and, in a word, to be a &s;y&s;tem wherein the author, without attempting to account for the re|ciprocal influence of the &s;oul on the body, reduces every thing to the latter of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, and believes a thinking and free-being, &s;u&s;ceptible of virtue and re|mor&s;e, to be wholly material.</P>
<P><HI>Secondat de Monte&s;quieu,</HI> a man in who&s;e mind, delicacy, &s;agacity and depth of
<PB N="xiv" REF="16">thought were &s;o happily blended, touched lightly upon this &s;ubject in his <HI>Spirit of Laws.</HI> Of all tho&s;e who have treated thereon, he was the fir&s;t that de&s;pi&s;ed the unintelligible Jargon of P&s;ycologi&s;ts, and reduced the &s;tudy of Man to that of na|ture. As he was a judicious ob&s;erver, and an excellent judge, he has thrown &s;ome light upon the thick darkne&s;s in which the&s;e matters were involved, and could di&s;cern amid&s;t its ob&s;curity the path which would have conducted him to truth. In the &s;light &s;ketch he has left us, we di&s;co|ver the great philo&s;opher; and from the little we have, we can judge of the whole de&s;ign, and regret that &s;o great a genius, did not favour the world with a complete treati&s;e on this &s;ubject, in&s;tead of the faint outlines he has left us.</P>
<P>But among all the authors who have em|barked in this attempt, <HI>Helvetius</HI> is perhaps the only one who undertook to handle this &s;ubject without any &s;kill in anatomy, any pro|ficiency in phy&s;ic, or knowledge of the re|ciprocal influence of the &s;oul on the body. Nay more, he has even written with a pro|fe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign to demon&s;trate the u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e helps, towards acquiring the know|ledge
<PB N="xv" REF="17">of Man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is more to be wondered at, as he makes &s;en|&s;ibility and memory two phy&s;ical faculties, which, ac|cording to him, are the only faculties of the &s;oul. See ch. 1. of Di&s;cour&s;e 1.</NOTE>. Being of an erroneous and &s;uperficial under&s;tanding, he fir&s;t builds a &s;y&s;tem, by which he ab&s;urdly attempts to reduce every phenomenon in Man to moral cau&s;es; and then confidently producing this as the only true and natural &s;y&s;tem, he proceeds to glean from hi&s;tory &s;ome &s;cat|tered pa&s;&s;ages and particular ca&s;es to con|firm his opinions, and tortures his mind to wre&s;t the phenomena to his purpo&s;e. Hence his work is only a &s;eries of &s;o|phi&s;ms, elaborately adorned with a pom|pous di&s;play of u&s;ele&s;s erudition.</P>
<P><HI>Haller,</HI> a celebrated phy&s;iologi&s;t, has likewi&s;e treated this &s;ubject, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s than his predece&s;&s;ors. At his fir&s;t out&s;et he wanders from nature, and afterwards makes vain and laborious efforts to arrive at truth. Having no clear knowledge of metaphy&s;ics, he confounds the faculties of the mind with the proper|ties of matter; after a&s;&s;igning the cerebrum as the &s;eat of the &s;oul, and as the &s;ole organ of its operations, he labours to deduce,
<PB N="xvi" REF="18">from the different degrees of con&s;i&s;tence in this <HI>vi&s;cus,</HI> and from the diver&s;ity in the circulation of the blood in its fibres, the rea&s;on of the phenomena relative to the influence of the phy&s;ical on the moral part in man. Hence we di&s;cover through|out his immen&s;e work no light whereby to demon&s;trate the rea&s;on of the&s;e pheno|mena; and his ideas are a chaos as dark as the &s;ubject he undertook to clear up ap|pears to have been to him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the beginning of the 17th Book, in the fifth volume of his Phy&s;iology.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Le Cat,</HI> the la&s;t of the moderns who engaged in this enterprize, &s;eems to have exhau&s;ted all his art on his &s;ubject. As he was a &s;kilful anatomi&s;t, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one part of the knowledge which mu&s;t form the ba&s;is of the edifice. And being an attentive ob&s;erver, he clo&s;ely applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of nature, and pro|bably would have penetrated far into its arcana, if, to his phy&s;ical knowledge, he had joined the lights of &s;ound p&s;ycology; if he had u&s;ed more accuracy and atten|tion in his ob&s;ervations; and had he not been &s;o much po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the frenzy of &s;y&s;tems. But as he wanted the&s;e aids, he
<PB N="xvii" REF="19">failed in his de&s;ign, and mi&s;&s;ed of that truth, which he believed he had attained to. It is true, we find in his works &s;ome good ob&s;ervations, and &s;ome &s;cattered rays of light; there is even an appearance of &s;omething like principles. But from his improper application of them; from his not being able to account for the pheno|mena which occurred to him, and were the con&s;equences naturally ari&s;ing from them; and from his confu&s;ed theory, we ea&s;ily perceive, that the author was altoge|ther unacquainted with nature, as well as with the extent, and con&s;equences of her laws: &s;o that the knowledge of Man, which he pretends to teach, is &s;o imper|fect, &s;o ob&s;cure, &s;o little developed, that truth it&s;elf appears hypothetic under his pen. Be&s;ides, as his genius partook more of the elegance of a lover of poe&s;y and of polite literature, than of the manly force of a clo&s;e rea&s;oner, his particular aim was rather to give his &s;ubject an agreeable air, than that &s;trength and maje&s;ty which form its proper character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I make not this remark to blame erudition in phi|lo&s;ophical works; on the contrary, well employed, it is very ornamental: what I mean is, that erudition ought not to be the principal, the only merit.</NOTE>; and he &s;ought more
<PB N="xviii" REF="20">to compo&s;e a work valuable for its eru|dition, than for its &s;olidity and &s;ublimity. Hence his writings are embelli&s;hed with elegant anatomical de&s;criptions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Treati&s;e on the Sen&s;ations and Pa&s;&s;ions in General.</NOTE>, and are filled with abundance of curious pa&s;&s;ages, in which their principal merit con&s;i&s;ts. The&s;e are the principal authors who have written on this &s;ubject; and who may ju&s;tly be cla&s;&s;ed among the foremo&s;t in point of reputation.</P>
<P>There are others who have engag|ed in the &s;ame pur&s;uit: but, except the &s;mall number already mentioned, none are worthy of notice.</P>
<P>From the writers be&s;t upon this &s;ubject, we may &s;elect &s;ome few ob&s;ervations that are ju&s;t, and meet with &s;ome feeble light thrown at times over particular points; but the whole amounts only to &s;ome &s;light elucidation of a &s;mall number of pheno|mena. Some of the&s;e philo&s;ophers have di&s;covered a few particular cau&s;es of the reciprocal influence of the &s;oul on the bo|dy, but were all of them wholly ignorant of its great and leading principles; they have di&s;covered &s;ome branches, but the
<PB N="xix" REF="21">&s;ource was entirely unknown. Thus if all the ju&s;t ob&s;ervations &s;cattered through|out their writings were collected, they would only form a &s;y&s;tem without a ba&s;is, and without any connection of its compo|nent parts. Truth, concealed in their writings under a cloud of errors and ab|&s;urdities, appears with the air of mere opinion, whereas it might have had the force of demon&s;tration with every charac|teri&s;tic of ab&s;olute certainty.</P>
<P>As all the&s;e different &s;y&s;tems are ill combined, ill grounded, and do not carry conviction, philo&s;ophers have not adopted them. On one hand, &s;truck with the contradictions which they perceived be|tween nature and the principles laid down by authors; and on the other, a&s;toni&s;hed at the variablene&s;s of the human mind, the cau&s;es of which were entirely un|known; di&s;couraged by the ill &s;ucce&s;s of others, and moreover unable to di&s;tin|gui&s;h truth from darkne&s;s, they have not attempted to elucidate the &s;malle&s;t phe|nomenon.</P>
<P>Thus for want of proper informati|on, they were for confounding every thing, and treated every opinion indi&s;cri|minately
<PB N="xx" REF="22">as ridiculous, every &s;y&s;tem as ab|&s;urd, and even the de&s;ign of &s;earching in|to nature as pre&s;umptuous. They proud|ly entrenched them&s;elves behind their own ignorance, &s;aw prodigies in the mo&s;t &s;im|ple facts, and looked upon the knowledge of Man as an enigma, as an impenetrable my&s;tery, a labyrinth whence there was no i&s;&s;ue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For proofs of this, read the works of Hume, Vol|taire, Bonnet, Racine, Pa&s;cal, &amp;.</NOTE>. Thus what they have written on the &s;ubject of Man, is no more than pom|pous inanity. With them, all is my&s;tery, all is in&s;crutable; ever in an ecta&s;y, they &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the truth, and contented them&s;elves with a &s;tupid admiration.</P>
<P>So that at pre&s;ent, mankind may be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of two &s;orts of beings; the vain and pre&s;umptuous, who are for a&s;&s;ign|ing rea&s;ons for every thing, even at the expence of good &s;en&s;e and experience: and the timid and credulous who are in a per|petual ecta&s;y of wonder at all they behold. We may therefore conclude, that except a few &s;cattered rays of light diffu&s;ed over &s;ome particular phenomena, the &s;cience of Man is hitherto entirely unknown.</P>
<P><PB N="xxi" REF="23">But when the greate&s;t geniu&s;es have been diffident of &s;ucceeding in handling this &s;ubject; when &s;o many great men have failed, and others have not dared to engage, &s;hall I hazard the undertaking, pre&s;ume to penetrate this palpable ob|&s;curity and fathom this profound aby&s;s? What talents, what &s;tudy, does &s;uch a ta&s;k require! What a fund of ob&s;erva|tion; what addre&s;s to reconcile &s;o many &s;eemingly incon&s;i&s;tent appearances, di&s;co|ver their connection, and amid&s;t &s;uch a complication of facts, di&s;cern that light which explains tho&s;e principles which un|veil and account for them! In a word, by the help of a glimmering taper, to di&s;cover &s;uch a multiplicity of undi&s;covered truths! How bold the enterprize, how difficult the execution!</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections are di&s;couraging I con|fe&s;s, and e&s;pecially when I con&s;ider the mediocrity of my talents; however, they &s;hall not make me renounce my re&s;o|lution. Neither the difficulty of the en|terprize, nor the ill &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e who have preceeded me; nor the general prejudice, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uc|ceed, &s;hall prevent me from attemping
<PB N="xxii" REF="24">it. Had men always yielded to de&s;pon|dency, truth would have &s;till remain|ed buried in ob&s;curity, and the mo&s;t important di&s;coveries had been yet to make.</P>
<P>Whether I have &s;ucceeded, the impar|tial public will be&s;t determine. I plead no other merit than the intrin&s;ic utility of the de&s;ign: what that is, I now proceed to inform my readers.</P>
<P>Man is but little known, becau&s;e im|properly &s;tudied; the rea&s;on of which is, that no one, who has made the at|tempt, has followed nature. In&s;tead of taking experience for their guide; in&s;tead of proceeding by ju&s;t ob&s;ervations to lay down a general &s;y&s;tem, of which every phenomenon was a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, philo&s;ophers have acted directly the re|ver&s;e: they have invented &s;y&s;tems, wre&s;ted the phenomena to conform thereto, and forced nature to &s;ubmit to their opinions. I have endeavoured to avoid their error: as a &s;imple ob&s;erver, I e&s;tabli&s;h no &s;y&s;|tem till the nece&s;&s;ity of facts obliges me thereto.</P>
<P>For Man to pre&s;ume, like the Creator,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="25">to read what pa&s;&s;es in the &s;oul, is an ab|&s;urd vanity; accordingly every attempt of metaphy&s;icians with this view has proved un&s;ucce&s;sful. As this principle acts inter|nally, as it is imperceptible by the &s;en&s;es, and cannot be &s;een but thro' the medi|um of the body, with which it is inti|mately united; by di&s;regarding the body, which is, as it were, a kind of cloath|ing to the &s;oul, and a covering which mu&s;t fir&s;t be removed, we frequently at|tribute to the &s;oul properties which be|long to the body: thus ever judging from appearances, and never &s;eeking to pene|trate deeper, we fall &s;hort of truth, and neglect the only mean which can conduct us thereto. We mu&s;t therefore endea|vour to penetrate to the &s;oul through the integuments of the body, and ob&s;erve the influence of the material &s;ub&s;tance upon the &s;piritual, to be able to di&s;tingui&s;h the properties peculiar to it, from &s;uch as are dependent on a foreign principle.</P>
<P>As the body is an extremely compli|cated machine, to form a &s;ound judgment of a &s;ingle &s;pring, make a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the influence of one part upon another,
<PB N="xxiv" REF="26">and of every part upon the whole, di&s;|cover the true relations between effects which appear remote, and connect particu|lar phenomena with their general princi|ples, we mu&s;t fir&s;t be acquainted with the &s;tructure of the whole machine. The anatomi&s;t, therefore, mu&s;t lay the foun|dation of the edifice; he alone can in|ve&s;tigate the &s;ecret &s;prings which act upon the &s;oul, affect it &s;o &s;trongly, and of who&s;e exi&s;tence the generality of mankind have no idea. I therefore begin by introducing my reader to the phy&s;ical knowledge of the human body. I de&s;cribe Man as an hydraulic machine, and as a compound of ve&s;&s;els and fluids; I then enter into a par|ticular examination of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, of the&s;e fluids, and of the action of the or|gans. I afterwards con&s;ider the body in its different mechanical relations, relatively to the nature of its functions; carefully avoiding a minute and di&s;gu&s;ting di&s;play of anatomical erudition, that I may pre|&s;ent to the reader e&s;&s;entials only, with &s;ome additional ob&s;ervations, equally &s;olid and intere&s;ting. The de&s;cription of the ani|mal machine and the explanation of its
<PB N="xxv" REF="27">mechani&s;m every where &s;ucceed each other, and I demon&s;trate in what manner this &s;tu|dy conducts the intelligent ob&s;erver to the &s;olution of many curious problems.</P>
<P>As the anatomi&s;t mu&s;t lay the platform of one part of this edifice, the metaphy|&s;ician mu&s;t erect the other. From the ex|amination of the &s;tructure of the body, therefore, I proceed to enquire into the na|ture of the &s;oul. Fir&s;t, I con&s;ider its dif|ferent powers, and then trace its progre&s;s in the unfolding and exerci&s;e of them. I enter into none of tho&s;e &s;ubtil and ridi|culous metaphy&s;ical di&s;qui&s;itions, in which &s;o many writers have wa&s;ted their time and labour; I offer none but &s;olid ob&s;er|vations, and &s;uch as are &s;u&s;ceptible of an equal degree of evidence with the mo&s;t unque&s;tioned phy&s;ical truths.</P>
<P>After we have con&s;idered the &s;oul and the body independently of each other, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the two &s;ub&s;tances as united, and examine their relations, to be able to &s;olve the wonderful phenomena ari&s;ing from their reciprocal influence. I there|fore con&s;ider Man in this view: but as it has often happened, that authors have
<PB N="xxvi" REF="28">compo&s;ed long and grave di&s;&s;ertations on the cau&s;es of effects which never exi&s;ted, I begin with e&s;tabli&s;hing facts. Be&s;ides, as the great number of groundle&s;s opini|ons and erroneous &s;y&s;tems have rendered truth it&s;elf &s;u&s;pected, when not founded on clear and evident facts, I rea&s;on only from con&s;tant and repeated ob&s;ervations; from ob&s;ervations univer&s;ally admitted and ea&s;ily a&s;certained, and &s;uch as e&s;tabli&s;h my &s;y&s;tem on the firme&s;t foundation.</P>
<P>Nothing but a &s;eries of accurate and uni|form ob&s;ervations can give &s;olidity to any &s;y&s;tem. It is only by &s;tudying nature, and by penetrating into its mo&s;t &s;ecret re|ce&s;&s;es, that we can attain to the di&s;covery of its arcana. It is only by aids drawn from ob&s;ervation, that we can receive that light, which mu&s;t direct us amid&s;t this darkne&s;s. It is not therefore by a vague and arbitrary hypothe&s;is, that we can hope to di&s;cover the &s;ecret cau&s;es of the influence of the &s;oul on the body, and of the body on the &s;oul. It is by an at|tentive examination of the phenomena; by comparing a great number of analogous
<PB N="xxvii" REF="29">ca&s;es, and deducing from them &s;ome com|mon property, which may be con&s;idered as their general cau&s;e and fir&s;t principle. Thus, after collecting a &s;ufficient number of facts, I con&s;ider them in all their dif|ferent a&s;pects, account for every pheno|menon from known phy&s;ical laws, and by an attentive examination of them, at|tempt to draw &s;ufficient light to di&s;co|ver the principles of the reciprocal influ|ence of the&s;e two di&s;tinct &s;ub&s;tances, and the natural explanation of their relations: that is, I endeavour to replace in the cla&s;s of &s;imple effects, tho&s;e phenomena, which have occa&s;ioned &s;uch wonder among&s;t phi|lo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>But that my work may form a well con|nected whole, and that all its parts may &s;erve to the elucidation of each other, it will be proper to place the reflexions of which it is compo&s;ed in proper order.</P>
<P>I therefore fir&s;t con&s;ider Man in general and in the ab&s;tract; then relatively to other animals; and afterwards to him&s;elf, fol|lowing him gradually through every age, from the in&s;tant of his birth, to the final period of his exi&s;tence. I con&s;ider him
<PB N="xxviii" REF="30">afterwards relatively to the difference of &s;ex, temperament and con&s;titution; and la&s;tly, relatively to the &s;oil, climate and condition. One word more and I have done.</P>
<P>As, from the nature of my &s;ubject, I mu&s;t treat of many different matters, all of the&s;e could not po&s;&s;ibly be comprehend|ed in one continued treati&s;e, or be pre|&s;ented under one &s;ingle point of view, I mu&s;t take leave to warn my readers, that they may expect to meet with many inter|ruptions; the thread of the work will be broken off by the multiplicity of objects, and by the nature of the facts which may require to be &s;poken to. On the other hand, being under a nece&s;&s;ity to keep the leading points ever in &s;ight, I mu&s;t be attentive at the &s;ame time to every par|ticular phenomenon as it occurs, &s;o as not to let even the mo&s;t minute e&s;cape me, &s;ince on the&s;e the connexion of the more im|portant parts very often depends: the re|petitions to be met with are to be account|ed for from the &s;ame cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The plan of my work is too compre|hen&s;ive for me to pre&s;ume I have explain|ed
<PB N="xxix" REF="31">every relation. On the contrary, I am convinced that many things have e&s;caped me: the &s;ubject is too copious, and gives ri&s;e to &s;uch an endle&s;s variety of ideas and reflexions, that it was frequently with dif|ficulty I could keep &s;ight of the main &s;cope of my de&s;ign, &s;o far from being able to exhau&s;t the &s;ubject. The great and mo&s;t important que&s;tion is, whether I have well examined the things which belong to my &s;ubject amid&s;t &s;o many perplexing ideas. The reader is the proper per&s;on to judge of that. I am &s;en&s;ible I may have been mi&s;taken in many re&s;pects; what Man, who con&s;iders as he ought the uncer|tainty of human knowledge, can be &s;o vain, as to think him&s;elf &s;ecure from error?</P>
<P>If I have failed in my aim, I may be at lea&s;t permitted to indulge the hope, that my labour will not be entirely thrown away; that I have thrown &s;ome light on many phenomena, which before were involved in ob&s;curity; removed many difficulties; launched into an ocean en|tirely unknown; forewarned others of the rocks on which my&s;elf was wrecked, and
<PB N="xxx" REF="32">opened a tract, by which others may here|after proceed. If I have thus far &s;uc|ceeded, my part is performed, and (be it &s;poken without arrogance) I may &s;ay with Ta&s;&s;o,</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the va&s;t &s;y&s;tem of beings, which nature offers to the con&s;idera|tion of a philo&s;opher, let us &s;elect Man, an animal, of which &s;o much has been written and hitherto &s;o little under&s;tood. What Subject can be more intere&s;ting, or more worthy of our enquiries?</P>
<P>Let us &s;urvey the whole &s;cene of Man, ob&s;erve what offers to the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;er|vation, as well as that which is more in|timately concealed. Let us follow the ra|pid movements and perpetual variations of the &s;oul, point out the diver&s;ity of minds and the lineaments which characterize them, di&s;play the hidden principles of cha|racter, and the &s;ecret &s;ources of genius and of the pa&s;&s;ions. Let us remove the veil which conceals them from our &s;ight, and explain why one Man differs from another, and each Man &s;o frequently from him&s;elf; let us enquire what Man is.</P>
<P>Man, confidered as an individual, is not the object of the pre&s;ent enquiry; but Man in general, of all countries, of all cli|mates,
<PB N="ii" REF="34">and of every age; an immen&s;e un|dertaking; a profound aby&s;s for the mind to attempt to fathom! Yet &s;uch is the importance of the enquiry, that I &s;hall not believe my labour wholly lo&s;t, &s;hould my &s;ucce&s;s hold any proportion to the dignity of my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But from what data &s;hall we rea&s;on upon Man? How di&s;cover the affinity between the &s;ub&s;tances which form his being, and the cau&s;es of their wonderful influence on each other, without being fir&s;t acquainted with the &s;ub&s;tances them&s;elves? And how are we to gain this acquaintance, but by con&s;idering their effects? Let us then ex|amine the&s;e effects; endeavour to ana|ly&s;e Man, and re&s;olve him into his origi|nal elements of body and &s;pirit; con&s;ider their properties and functions, and view the order ob&s;ervable in the mechani&s;m of the one, and in the exerci&s;e of the faculties of the other.</P>

<P>But fir&s;t let me contract &s;o exten&s;ive a &s;ubject, and endeavour to reduce it within its proper limits.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not con&s;ider in this work, tho&s;e properties of the body which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in common with matter in general, &s;uch as exten&s;ion, &s;olidity, gravity; nor, in &s;hort, any thing which does not belong to it as an organized machine.</P>
<P>Neither is it nece&s;&s;ary for me to undertake the anatomical de&s;cription of the parts
<PB N="34" REF="40">which compo&s;e this machine. To give an exact de&s;cription of them, is a ta&s;k I &s;hall leave to anatomi&s;ts.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign I here propo&s;e to my&s;elf, is to con&s;ider the mechani&s;m of the human body in &s;ome general points of view, and chie&s;ly with re&s;pect to comparative anatomy; I confine my&s;elf to &s;uch de&s;criptions only of this machine, as are nece&s;&s;ary to give a pro|per knowledge of its functions, and to en|able me to convey my ideas with order and preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The material part of Man forms an ad|mirable machine on hydraulic principles; we di&s;cover therein innumerable channels with fluids of various kinds, and particu|larly one principal fluid which gives motion to the whole. I &s;hall omit the prolix ob|&s;ervations of anatomi&s;ts, and the calcula|tions of <HI>Verdriers</HI> of the prodigious number of our ve&s;&s;els: I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that both the eye and the micro&s;cope convince us, that the human body is entirely com|po&s;ed of ve&s;&s;els, of liquors contained in tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and of membranes to which they adhere.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="41">Both ve&s;&s;els and membranes are termed <HI>&s;olids;</HI> all the other parts are cla&s;&s;ed among the <HI>fluids.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>SOLIDS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The &s;olid parts of the human body are all compo&s;ed of an homogeneous &s;ub&s;tance, of a gelatinous juice, or rather of the &s;o|lid parts of this juice, more or le&s;s &s;epa|rated from the fluid, and intimately com|bined one with another.</P>
<P>In analy&s;ing the organic parts of the animal machine, the deepe&s;t re&s;earches have &s;ucceeded no farther than the di&s;co|very of a &s;imple fibre; and of this we judge more from the imagination than from the &s;ight.</P>
<P>From the mo&s;t attentive examination of the carnous &s;ub&s;tance of the body, the mo&s;t &s;imple fibres which the micro&s;cope can di&s;cover appear hollow, and the cli|mentary parts of the&s;e fibres, we may ea&s;ily perceive, are compo&s;ed of other &s;mall fi|bres which have no cavity, much re&s;em|bling a filament of &s;ilk, which is com|po&s;ed of many &s;maller filaments; and this fibre without a cavity is what we call <HI>a &s;imple fibre,</HI> &s;ee fig. 1, and mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered
<PB N="36" REF="42">as the organized principle of all the &s;olids, &s;ince it is the farthe&s;t boundary to which our re&s;earches can po&s;&s;ibly attain.</P>
<P>From this idea of the con&s;truction of fibres, it will be no difficult ta&s;k to di&s;co|ver their properties; they will be lax and &s;lexible, if too much moi&s;tened with lymph, or if their elementary capillaments are not clo&s;ely enough united; on the con|trary, they will be &s;tiff and rigid if the lymph be too &s;paringly &s;upplied, and if their con&s;tituent parts are too firmly com|bined. The &s;olid parts of the animal machine differ one from another by their texture, according as it is more or le&s;s compact; upon this difference depends that of their <HI>prim tive ela&s;ticity.</HI></P>
<P>Simple fibres united in a parallel direc|tion, and fa&s;hioned into a cylinder, form a &s;mall tube, which we term <HI>an organic fibre,</HI> or <HI>fibrillu.</HI> See fig. 11.</P>
<P>Many organic fibres united compo&s;e a <HI>mu&s;cular fibre,</HI> &s;ee fig. 111, and of the&s;e organic and mu&s;cular fibres are formed membranes, ve&s;&s;els, the carnous &s;ub&s;tance of the body, the bones, mu&s;cles, and the whole texture of the &s;olids.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Body, con&s;idered as the general Organ of <HI>SENSE</HI> and <HI>MOTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALthough the body is compo&s;ed of &s;o many different machines, and although each of the&s;e machines has its particular functions, yet the&s;e different functions are performed upon the&s;e two principles on|ly, viz. <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> and <HI>Motion.</HI></P>
<P>The motion of the heart and ve&s;|&s;els, is the cau&s;e of the circulation of our fluids; the motion of the jaws di|vides the aliments; the irritation of the &s;alival and &s;tomachic glands, oc|ca&s;ioned by the attrition and &s;timulus of the aliments pre&s;&s;ing them to di&s;|charge their liquors, when &s;et in motion by the internal heat, performs dige&s;tion. By motion external objects act on the body, and by the &s;en&s;es we receive their impre&s;&s;ions: finally, by motion and &s;en&s;e, we perform both tho&s;e actions which are voluntary, and tho&s;e which ap|pear to be mechanical. Examine the functions of our organs, all the pheno|mena of the animal oeconomy, and you will not find one which has not for its
<PB N="39" REF="46">cau&s;e either the one or the other of the&s;e principles, or the two principles united.</P>
<P>If we enquire into the origin of this principle in a living animal, we &s;hall ob|&s;erve, that of all the parts of the body, the nerves only, and the nervous productions, are the &s;eat and organs of motion, as may be proved by a great number of experi|ments.</P>
<P>Extenal objects act on our bodies; we feel this impre&s;&s;ion in that part on which they act, and the &s;oul is con&s;cious of this impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We can extend and move our limbs at plea&s;ure; if I would extend my arm, in an in&s;tant my arm is extended; here the &s;oul commands and the body obeys.</P>
<P>If you fix a tight ligature on a nerve at its in&s;ertion into a mu&s;cle or on any part higher, immediately the mu&s;cle lo&s;es its motion. If you &s;orce the point of a lan|cet into this mu&s;cle, which will be now paralytic, it immediately contracts, but the &s;oul is not con&s;cious of this impre&s;&s;ion; when the nerve is divided, you will ob|&s;erve the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>Puncture the heart of a living animal, and you will find the heart to contract;
<PB N="40" REF="47">&s;eparate this heart from the body, again puncture it, and you will find it again to contract; however frequently you may repeat this experiment, the &s;ame pheno|menon will en&s;ue: proceed further; divide the heart into many pieces, puncture eve|ry one apart, and in each the &s;ame effect will be &s;een. Take any animal you plea&s;e, the &s;ame effects will always follow the &s;ame experiments.</P>
<P>If you cut the body of a viper into ma|ny pieces, you will perceive every part to be contorted and moving like &s;o many di&s;|tinct animals; whil&s;t the head will be re|verted, and will attack its hinder parts with its teeth.</P>
<P>During a battle, limbs &s;eparated from the body are frequently perceived palpi|tating on the ground.</P>
<P>Thus the principle, which cau&s;es the con&s;truction of the heart and the motion of the limbs, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts for a while after they are &s;eparated from the body.</P>
<P>From the&s;e experiments, frequently re|peated and con&s;tantly attended with the &s;ame event, it follows,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that the &s;oul is not the immediate mover of the body.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="48">Secondly, that the &s;oul does not feel in every part, nor is it diffu&s;ed through the whole body.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that &s;en&s;ation is performed by the nervous fibres upon which objects act.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that &s;en&s;ations are communi|cated to the &s;oul by the nerves. The bo|dy is therefore &s;en&s;ible of it&s;elf independ|ently of the &s;oul, &s;ince irritability is a pro|perty of nervous fibres: in this ca&s;e, the reality confirms the appearance.</P>
<P>But object not, as &s;ome philo&s;ophers have done, that the &s;oul is often confound|ed with the body, from whence it hap|pens, that the &s;oul imputes its peculiar &s;en&s;ations to the body, and believes that it is the body, when it is the &s;oul only which feels; thus the &s;oul imagines that the ear hears, the eye &s;ees, and the finger &s;uffers the pain of a puncture, which is &s;elt only by it&s;elf. Neither &s;ay with a ce|lebrated modern phy&s;iologi&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Cat, in his Treati&s;e on Mu&s;cular Motion, page 306, Berlin 1765.</NOTE>. <Q>That an immaterial &s;ub&s;tance occupies no &s;pace, that it cannot be &s;aid the &s;oul can be in two or more places at one and the &s;ame time, although by its influence
<PB N="42" REF="49">it act in &s;everal places at the &s;ame in|&s;tant; that it acts there by its influ|ence only, but not phy&s;ically like a ma|terial &s;ub&s;tance, &s;ince the &s;oul is not material; that if the action and influ|ence of the &s;oul, exerci&s;ed in &s;everal parts at one time, prove its divi&s;ibility; it will not be at all nece&s;&s;ary, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h that opinion, to cut an ani|mal into many parts; that if you punc|ture at the &s;ame time the hands, the feet and the face of a living per&s;on, eve|one of the&s;e organs will contract to avoid the pain; that the heart, &s;epa|rated from the body of an animal, and the divided parts of an eel, are not more di&s;tant one from another, than the parts ju&s;t mentioned are naturally di&s;tant in Man.</Q> What can the&s;e &s;pecious argu|ments avail again&s;t direct facts?</P>
<P><Q>The &s;oul is not material, neither does it occupy any place in the &s;ame manner with a material &s;ub&s;tance.</Q> Be it &s;o; but does it follow from thence, that it had no determinate &s;eat, whence it extends its influence? Fix a tight liga|ture on a nerve at its in&s;ertion into a mu&s;cle, does it not render that mu&s;cle
<PB N="43" REF="50">paralytic, and cut off all communication of the &s;oul with that organ? Does it not entirely de&s;troy their connection? And is not whatever is acting in that part, as perfectly unknown to the &s;oul, as if tho part were it&s;elf removed to the greate&s;t di&s;tance? If then the &s;oul perceives not what is acting in any organ after the liga|ture is fixed on its nerve, is it to be &s;uppo&s;|ed, it can perceive what is acting in the &s;ame organ after amputation.</P>
<P>Why then does the mu&s;cle contract it|&s;elf upon any painful impre&s;&s;ion, after the ligature is made? It is becau&s;e the &s;ub|&s;tance of the nerves is really it&s;elf &s;en&s;ible. And be&s;ides is it not evident, that if the body be in&s;en&s;ible, the &s;oul mu&s;t always command the body to receive the impre&s;|&s;ions of objects? And that without this command, objects would not produce any &s;en&s;ation in the &s;oul, as the eye perceives not di&s;tant objects without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the tele&s;cope? If the nerves had no &s;en&s;e, how could they communicate to the &s;oul any &s;en&s;ation which they them&s;elves had not received? How could they affect it, &s;o frequently as they do, in oppo&s;ition to it&s;elf?</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="51">With regard to the motion and contraction of the organs, I well perceive that the &s;oul, though &s;imple in its &s;ub&s;tance, can at one and the &s;ame time influence many organs in the animal machine; but it can|not perform this without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the nerves, and that only, as I &s;hall prove hereafter, when the &s;ub&s;tance of the nerves is &s;ound, without compre&s;&s;ion, and with|out a &s;olution of continuity, and when the fluid with which they are filled has free communication with its &s;ource. Can it do &s;o when a nerve has been divided, and the influx of the fluid interrupted? Or in the limbs, which have been &s;eparated from the body, though yet palpitating with life, can the connexion &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t? Is not every member when di&s;united an entire independent body? It is therefore idle to pretend to compare the conformity of the di&s;tance betwixt the divided parts of an eel, with that of the di&s;tinct parts of an human body, as equally influenced by the &s;oul. Be&s;ides, how can we pre|&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;oul acts in each of the&s;e mutilated parts, without affirming at the &s;ame time that the &s;oul may be di|vided?</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="52">Shall we &s;ay that every part &s;o divided has a &s;oul? This would be giving many &s;ouls to one animal; or if you would ra|ther &s;uppo&s;e that the body has no &s;en&s;ibi|lity, it can then have but one &s;oul, which was divided at the time when the limbs were &s;eparated from the body: what ab|&s;urdities is this &s;y&s;tem compo&s;ed of! Let it not be objected, that the &s;en&s;itive plant contracts it&s;elf on being touched in the &s;ame manner with the nerves; neither a&s;k if &s;en&s;ibility be a property of matter; of what u&s;e would the &s;en&s;e of feeling be to a being which has none of the other &s;en&s;es? I would an&s;wer, That is entirely unknown to me; but what can you infer from thence? That there is &s;omething &s;uperflu|ous in the works of the Creator? Are you acquainted with all the laws of nature, thus daringly to determine on its works? Neverthele&s;s when I have yielded you this, what conclu&s;ion can you draw from this, again&s;t the &s;en&s;ibility of the nerves?</P>
<P>There are ca&s;es where contraction is not the effect of &s;en&s;ibility, but of &s;ome mechanical cau&s;e, &s;uch as the contraction of a &s;tring of catgut, parchment, or green wood, expo&s;ed to the heat; the ela&s;tic
<PB N="46" REF="53">fluid, which is contained within their &s;ub&s;tance, being di&s;engaged by the action of the fire, e&s;capes, and in e&s;caping, agi|tates the body in which it was contained. The ca&s;e may be the &s;ame, where the contraction following a puncture, is the con&s;equence of laws purely phy&s;ical, and not the effect of &s;en&s;ibility. It may like|wi&s;e be the ca&s;e of the &s;en&s;itive plant, but this is a problem no one is able to re&s;olve. The que&s;tion, which regards this plant, will remain for ever undecided: as the plant is not animated, &s;en&s;ation may be &s;o produced, as to preclude all means of di&s;covery.</P>
<P>In animal bodies, the contraction which immediately follows any painful impre&s;|&s;ion, is certainly the effect of &s;en&s;ibility, as is proved by the identity of the pheno|mena in the amputated parts of the body, and in the body before amputation.</P>
<P>Hence the denying &s;en&s;ibility to the bo|dy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But are our nerves endued with &s;en&s;ibility, as be|ing compo&s;ed of &s;en&s;ible parts, which parts are formed of very minute &s;en&s;ible particles? Or is not &s;en&s;ibility a quality which re&s;ults from their particular arrange|ment? Who is a&s;&s;ured of this? Yet, to judge by our imperfect conception of the grounds of things, we would be apt to believe, that the elements of the body are not endued with &s;en&s;ibility; they are perfectly &s;olid, and con&s;equently incapable of any di&s;arrangement of parts, without which external objects cannot make any impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;en&s;es. Be&s;ides, all bodies are com|po&s;ed of &s;imilar elements, and of principles which are common to all, only differently arranged; the princi|ples of which nerves are formed, are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of which leaves, flowers, fruits, and plants are compo&s;ed; hence &s;en&s;ibility probably belongs to matter, as a property dependent on its organization. Moreover, &s;en&s;ibility ex|tends it&s;elf to every part of the body, in the &s;ame manner as life, and animates the&s;e parts no longer than while the fluid of the nerves remains, (&s;ee the experiments hereafter mentioned) and while the combinations of the organs continue unchanged. But who can admit the&s;e rea|&s;ons as demon&s;trative? Who has &s;o little ob&s;erved na|ture, as to undertake to explain the whole by the &s;mall number of its known laws, and to think there is nought but uniformity in the univer&s;e.</NOTE>, and giving it entirely to the &s;oul, is to oppo&s;e evidence it&s;elf.</P>

<P>The &s;eat of the &s;oul naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf here for our determination.</P>
<P>The reader, a&s;toni&s;hed that the &s;oul feels not in every part of the body, will doubtle&s;s enquire where the &s;eat of the &s;oul is. This que&s;tion mu&s;t be an&s;wered by facts.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="55">We know that the membranes which &s;upply a coat to the &s;pinal marrow, are a continuation of the meninges, and that they give ri&s;e to all the nerves of the lower parts. In all animals, a tran&s;ver&s;e &s;ection of the <HI>medulla &s;pinalis,</HI> is immediately fol|lowed by a paralytic affection of all the parts &s;ituated below that &s;ection; after which, the &s;oul receives not any &s;en&s;ation from the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Luxations, whereby the &s;pinal marrow is compre&s;&s;ed, are attended with the &s;ame effects.</P>
<P>If you divide the membranous produc|tions of the brain, or that part whence they &s;end off a coat to the <HI>medulla oblongata,</HI> or even fix a tight ligature thereon, the whole body of the animal is in&s;tantly without motion, and the &s;oul is deprived of &s;en&s;ation, the head only giving &s;ome faint &s;igns of life. This is evident in the <HI>Tetanos,</HI> a di&s;ea&s;e &s;omewhat uncom|mon, produced by a violent contraction of this part. In the pal&s;y, a di&s;order &s;o fre|quent and &s;o dreadful, life is gradually ex|tingui&s;hed, the limbs &s;ucce&s;&s;ively lo&s;e their motion, the extremities become in|&s;en&s;ible, death &s;teals on the trunk, mark|ing
<PB N="49" REF="56">his cour&s;e on every part he pa&s;&s;es over until &s;carce any &s;igns of life are perceived, and the&s;e in the head only.</P>
<P>If the&s;e ob&s;ervations do not preci&s;ely mark out the &s;eat of the &s;oul, they &s;how at lea&s;t that we are to look for it no where but in the head. To the&s;e proofs let us add our own feelings; every one who thinks inten&s;ely, perceives a kind of ten|&s;ion within his head, and that his ideas are formed within that organ.</P>
<P>Anatomi&s;ts agree, that we mu&s;t look for the &s;eat of the &s;oul in the head; but they are not unanimous what place it oc|cupies in that part of the body. Some place it in the <HI>pineal gland,</HI> others in the <HI>corpus callo&s;um,</HI> others again in the <HI>cere|brum;</HI> &s;ome in the <HI>cerebellum,</HI> and &s;ome in the <HI>meninges.</HI> But of the&s;e different opinions, the la&s;t only is well founded; for, if we trace the nerves to their entrance into the membranes of the brain, we &s;hall find they confound them&s;elves with the <HI>me|ninges,</HI> and form one &s;imple uniform &s;ub|&s;tance with them. Hence if the nerves only are &s;en&s;ible, and if the &s;en&s;ations are not continued to the &s;oul but by the&s;e or|gans, we plainly perceive, that the me|ninges
<PB N="50" REF="57">mu&s;t be e&s;teemed the &s;eat of the &s;oul. For as the&s;e membranes and their productions are the general organs of &s;en|&s;ation, and as the &s;oul is at the concour&s;e of all the &s;en&s;ations of the body, its &s;eat mu&s;t be in that part where this concour&s;e appears, viz. at the centre of all the or|gans of &s;en&s;ation; the&s;e membranes are this centre. Experience likewi&s;e daily confirms it; the &s;lighte&s;t inflammation of the meninges occa&s;ions a delirium, and a temporary in&s;anity. The irritation of the nerves, by the fumes of wine from drink|ing to exce&s;s, or by the fumes of to|bacco, is followed by the irritation of the meninges and lo&s;s of rea&s;on; this never happens to any other part of the head.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of the cerebrum and ce|rebellum, may be taken from a living ani|mal, without the &s;oul's being in&s;tantly affected; and though the wounds of the centre of the brain, of the pineal gland, and of the corpus callo&s;um, &s;ometimes injure the functions of the &s;oul, it is not becau&s;e the &s;eat of the mind is in ei|ther of the&s;e parts; but becau&s;e the&s;e parts &s;ecrete a fluid which is nece&s;&s;ary to its ope|rations, and by rea&s;on of the irritation which
<PB N="51" REF="58">woulds in the&s;e parts communicate to the meninges.</P>
<P>In the&s;e membranes eternal wi&s;dom has placed the &s;oul, and united it to our organs by imperceptible bands; here it has fixed the &s;eat of thought, of memo|ry, and of the will.</P>

<P>The &s;ub&s;tance only is &s;en&s;ible; the me|dulla of the brain has been proved to be void of &s;en&s;ibility, even in the cerebrum it&s;elf. The Memoirs of the Academy of Surgery at Paris contain many ob&s;erva|tions on foreign bodies, &s;uch as mu&s;ket balls, pieces of iron, heads of arrows,
<PB N="53" REF="60">points of &s;words, &s;plinters of the crani|um, contained for many years in the &s;ub|&s;tance of the brain, &s;ome of which had never been di&s;charged; and this without occa&s;ioning the lea&s;t injury to the per&s;ons in who&s;e brains they were found. But there are proofs yet more convincing. Open the brain of a living animal, ju&s;t at the &s;ection of the meninges, the animal will &s;uffer extreme agony, and vent the mo&s;t doleful cries; keep the lips of the wound open, and when its cries remit, thru&s;t the point of any in&s;trument a good way in|to the &s;ub&s;tance of the brain, the animal will &s;till be &s;ilent and not give the lea&s;t &s;ign of any painful &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>The medulla of the brain is then in|&s;en&s;ible; &s;o is the nervous fluid. The ex|periments of <HI>Mariotte</HI> prove, that the light, which directly acts on that fluid at the extremity of the optic nerve, makes no impre&s;&s;ion thereon; and that, to com|municate its impre&s;&s;ion to that fluid, is re|quired the mediation of a &s;olid membrane. The experiments of <HI>Mery</HI> prove the &s;ame with re&s;pect to the retina, which is an ex|pan&s;ion of the medulla of the optic nerve.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="61">Therefore the &s;olid part only of the nerve is &s;en&s;ible; but in what manner do the nerves communicate their &s;en&s;ations to the &s;oul? Is it by the &s;ub&s;tance of the nerves, or by the fluid which circulates within them? An an&s;wer to this que&s;tion is likewi&s;e to be deduced from facts.</P>
<P>We have &s;een in the foregoing experi|ments, that after a ligature is fixed on a nerve, the &s;oul is not con&s;cious of any impre&s;&s;ion of objects on the mu&s;cle, into which this nerve is in&s;erted; the ligature then has cut off its communication with the &s;oul. That interception is not occa|&s;ioned by the &s;imple ligature, but by in|terrupting the action of its fluid: other|wi&s;e the impre&s;&s;ion, which an object has made on one part of a nerve, would be continued by its &s;ub&s;tance, as the motion which is communicated to one end of a cord, which is &s;trained and tied in many parts, will extend, notwith&s;tanding the ty|ing, to the other extremity; the ligature not having occa&s;ioned a &s;olution of conti|nuity. I could likewi&s;e, if nece&s;&s;ary, op|po&s;e to tho&s;e writers who attribute this communication to the &s;ub&s;tance of the nerve, and who pretend, that the &s;en&s;ations
<PB N="55" REF="62">are communicated to the &s;oul by the tre|mor of the nervous fibres, by an uninter|rupted continuity of a vibrating nerve, that the nerves are &s;ometimes relaxed; that they make many circumvolutions in their various branches, that their principles are to their productions, or their trunks to their branches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From a ganglion, which takes its ri&s;e from a &s;in|gle nerve, frequently &s;pring about an hundred other nerves nearly of the &s;ame magnitude, and from this hundred near a thou&s;and more.</NOTE>, as one to many thou|&s;ands; in fine, that mo&s;t of the nerves ter|minate in ganglions, and that the greater part take their ri&s;e from them, and not im|mediately from the covering of the brain. Thus the impre&s;&s;ions of objects, commu|nicated to the nerves, cannot be propagat|ed by their &s;ub&s;tance: for how can the nerves, which never reach the brain, car|ry the impre&s;&s;ion of objects to the <HI>&s;en&s;o|rium commune?</HI> The &s;en&s;ations mu&s;t there|fore be produced by the coats of the nerves, and be communicated to the &s;oul by the vous fluid.</P>
<P>But how can an in&s;en&s;ible &s;ub&s;tance communicate a &s;en&s;ation, of which it is
<PB N="56" REF="63">not at all &s;u&s;ceptible in it&s;elf. This que&s;|tion I confe&s;s my&s;elf unable to an&s;wer, neither is it related to my pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>We have &s;een that the tying a nerve, &s;omewhat above its in&s;ertion into a mu&s;|cle, is followed by a paralytic affection of that mu&s;cle; but if you pre&s;s that nerve with your fingers, gradually moving them from the ligature towards its in&s;ertion, you will immediately perceive the mu&s;cle to contract and recover its motion. This can only be occa&s;ioned by the fluid con|tained in the nerve, and determined to|wards the mu&s;cle by this compre&s;&s;ion: hence it appears, that the motions of the mu&s;cles depends on their being connected with the brain by the nerves.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid it is conclu|&s;ive, that the &s;en&s;ations are communicated to the &s;oul by the nervous fluid. Hence this fluid acts immediately on the &s;oul. And &s;ince the nervous fluid is the imme|diate principle of motion to the body, the &s;oul acts directly on this fluid in all volun|tary motions.</P>

<P>We have &s;een that the fixing a tight li|gature on a nerve, &s;omewhat above its in|&s;ertion into a mu&s;cle, renders that mu&s;|cle paralytic: we have &s;een likewi&s;e, that if the nerve be pre&s;&s;ed with the fin|gers, gradually moving them from the li|gature to its in&s;ertion, the mu&s;cle imme|diately contracts and recovers its motion.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="67">This ob&s;ervation determines the manner of the &s;oul's action on the fluid of the nerves: and hence its appears, that its ac|tion on this fluid is an impul&s;ive motion towards the organ it wills to contract. The impo&s;&s;ibility of repelling the fluid, with which the nerve is replete, towards the ligature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, towards the part between the fingers and the mu&s;cle.</NOTE>, without repelling at the &s;ame time a part towards the mu&s;cle, de|prives us of the means of proving this by the oppo&s;ite experiment. But an ob&s;er|vation ea&s;y to be made, and which is nearly equivalent to this experiment, is, that the quantity of the fluid which, in this latter in&s;tance, is determined towards the mu&s;cle, is le&s;s than in the former; the contraction mu&s;t therefore be weaker, as experience fully confirms. <HI>Le Cat,</HI> who had not made this ob&s;ervation, was a&s;toni&s;hed on compre&s;&s;ing the nerve, gra|dually moving the pre&s;&s;ure from the mu&s;|cle to the ligature, to find the mu&s;cle con|tract. Deceived thereby, he &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, that it was not by the influx of the nervous fluid into the mu&s;cle, that that organ recovered its motion, and gave

<P>With regard to the manner in which the &s;en&s;ations are continued to the &s;oul, it is evident to me, that this mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned by the reflux of that fluid to the <HI>&s;en&s;orium commune.</HI> But this is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ays the phy&s;iologi&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e of the Sen&s;ations and the Pa&s;&s;ions, vol. 1. page 186. Paris 1767.</NOTE>, ju&s;t cited: <Q>For the &s;pirits are impelled ince&s;&s;antly to every part by the motion of the meninges, as the arterial blood is impelled by the heart towards the &s;ame membranes. How can it be imagined, that a &s;traw, which tickles the &s;ole of the foot, can repel the nervous fluid to the brain, &s;ince there is no impre&s;&s;ion &s;ufficient to repel the lea&s;t drop of blood from the feet to the heart?

<PB N="62" REF="69">from forcing a pointed in&s;trument into the part, which neverthele&s;s produces a much more pungent &s;en&s;ation.</Q></P>
<P>We &s;hall perceive how weak this objec|tion is, if we con&s;ider but for a moment, how exceedingly gentle the motion of the meninges is, which determines the ner|vous fluid into the nerves, when compar|ed with the motion of the heart, which im|pels the blood into the arteries, particular|ly if we only ob&s;erve, that the nerves have no valves like the blood ve&s;&s;els, to pre|vent the reflux of their fluid; above all if we ob&s;erve, that our author is unacquaint|ed with the cau&s;e of the reflux of this fluid, and that he confounds the force of this reflux with the quantity of the fluid in motion. For it is not the action of an external object, as a compre&s;&s;ing cau&s;e, but as an irritating one, which occa&s;ions the nervous fluid to flow back. By irri|tating the nervous fibres, it obliges them to contract and to impel the fluid, which is now compre&s;&s;ed in their contracted channels, with &s;o much the more force as the irritation is greater. Now as that contraction begins always in the part af|fected, &s;o the nervous fluid is always ne|ce&s;&s;arily

<P>Although the &s;en&s;ations be communi|cated to the &s;oul by the reflux of the ner|vous fluid, it does not follow from thence, that the portion of this fluid, which is con|tained in the organ immediately affected, continues its reflux quite to the &s;oul. This communication is effected by the conti|nuity of the column of the nervous fluid: that part therefore of this column, which is &s;urrounded by nervous fibres, which are immediately affected, is the medium of communication with the other parts, and &s;o on towards the brain, by their recipro|cal and in&s;tantaneous pre&s;&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> NERVOUS FLUID.</HEAD>
<P>I have proved, that the nervous fluid is the band which unites the &s;oul and the body: the exi&s;tence of this fluid is evi|dent: but what is its nature? To di&s;co|ver this, let us con&s;ider its effects; be|ginning with a &s;hort examination of the organs by which it is prepared.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="71">The <HI>cerebrum</HI> is the filtre of this fluid, and the <HI>cerebellum</HI> its re&s;ervoir. The ce|rebrum has all the characters of an organ of &s;ecretion; its cortical &s;ub&s;tance is form|ed of an infinite number of very minute glands, which are found in all organs of that kind; its medullary part is compo&s;ed of &s;mall fibres, who&s;e direction may be ea&s;ily perceived, although their cavity be undi&s;coverable by the be&s;t gla&s;&s;es: the particles which form that fluid are carri|ed into the filtre by the carotid and ver|tebral arteries. Thus the nervous liquor is &s;ecreted from our other fluids: but what do our fluids &s;upply to the brain for the production of this &s;ubtil liquor? Or ra|ther, what is this liquor it&s;elf? It is only by con&s;idering its effects, as I have alrea|dy &s;aid, that we can di&s;cover its nature; let us therefore examine its properties.</P>
<P>The nervous fluid &s;erves both to the motion of our organs, and to the nouri&s;h|ment of the nerves: I &s;hall examine it in the&s;e two points of view.</P>
<P>The nerves receive an increa&s;e propor|tioned to that of the other parts of the body; and, their &s;ub&s;tance not being pe|netrated by any foreign organ, they take
<PB N="65" REF="72">their increa&s;e from the fluid which circu|lates within them: this fluid mu&s;t there|fore be analogous to the &s;ub&s;tance of the nerve, and is, in fact, a nervous jelly, &s;ince all the nervous productions are re|&s;olvable into a liquor of this kind.</P>
<P>This gelatinous liquor is very ob&s;ervable in the internal part of the brain and its ventricles; it may be &s;een oozing from ul|cerated nerves; it may al&s;o be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed in that tumor, which is formed by the nervous fluid extrava&s;ated from its natural ve&s;&s;els, known by the name of the <HI>hernia &s;pinalis:</HI> it is particularly ob&s;ervable in the &s;emen; in a word, all our fluids are vi&s;i|bly &s;upplied with this gelatinous lymyh.</P>
<P>But the nervous fluid is not &s;imply the principle of nouri&s;hment to the nerves, it is likewi&s;e the &s;ource of &s;trength to the whole body: the animal, in which his fluid abounds, is di&s;tingui&s;hed for its un|common &s;trength; its lo&s;s occa&s;ions lan|gour and dejection. Can this quality then be the cau&s;e of both the&s;e effects? To determine the que&s;tion, I &s;hall endeavour to rea&s;on from facts.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable lo&s;s of this fluid, affects as with langour and dejection; it is &s;carce
<PB N="66" REF="73">extrava&s;ated from its ve&s;&s;els, when the bo|dy no longer retains its vigor, the limbs are without &s;trength, and the organs in a general &s;tupor. By &s;uppo&s;ing this fluid to be no other than the nervous lymph, we might ea&s;ily conceive how any con&s;idera|ble lo&s;s of it would, in length of time, render the motions languid; but why is it followed by in&s;tant depre&s;&s;ion, and by &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a languor, &s;ince the nerves are not without nouri&s;hment? For the ner|vous fluid lo&s;t, was certainly intended to nouri&s;h the nerves for &s;ome &s;pace of time. It is therefore manife&s;t, that if the weak|ne&s;s, which en&s;ued on the lo&s;s of that flu|id, was produced by a diminution of nu|trition, by an atrophy of the nervous parts, it would have come on by degrees, and not in&s;tantaneou&s;ly.</P>
<P>But let us penetrate yet farther, and en|deavour to di&s;cover the nature of this flu|id, from the manner of its preparation.</P>
<P>The nervous fluid is ince&s;&s;antly di&s;&s;i|pating, it is exhau&s;ted by action and like|wi&s;e by re&s;t: for we perceive our &s;trength to fail after fa&s;ting, though in a &s;tate of perfect inaction, in the &s;ame manner as af|ter violent exerci&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="74">When a per&s;on is under this languid depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate, if you give him &s;omewhat moderately &s;pirituous to drink, he finds his &s;trength immediately recruited and his vigour renewed: the draught there|fore has re&s;tored to the nerves the princi|ple they had lo&s;t. How &s;hould this be po&s;&s;ible, if the nervous fluid be only a purely gelatinous juice; &s;eeing we cannot extract one gelatinous particle from any &s;pirituous liquor? Hence, be&s;ides this ge|latinous juice, the fluid of the nerves is compo&s;ed of a &s;pirituous lymph: I &s;ay &s;pirituous, becau&s;e tho&s;e aliments which abound with &s;pirits, &s;upply the body with this principle of life, and becau&s;e a very &s;mall quantity of &s;uch aliments &s;upplies more of it, than a very great quantity of food which is only &s;lightly impregnated therewith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A gla&s;s of any cordial wine gives more &s;trength than ten times the &s;ame quantity of a decoction of oats or barley; it is however certain, that art cannot extract any gelatinous particles from this wine, nor is it certain that it contains any. On the other hand, it is evident, that a decoction of barley is &s;trongly im|pregnated therewith, and that ten parts of this de|coction produces two parts or more of purely gela|tious juice.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="75">Should any one object, that the&s;e &s;pirits will injure the nerves by acting on their internal &s;ub&s;tance, &s;eeing they have that effect when applied outwardly; I an&s;wer, that they act not directly on the nerves, and that they are &s;heathed by the nervous lymph, which &s;erves as a vehicle to them. What confirms me in this opinion is, that there is no aliment throughout the vege|table or animal kingdoms, from which more or le&s;s of this &s;pirituous fluid might not be extracted, and con&s;equently &s;upply the body with the principle of motion.</P>
<P>Let us hence conclude, that the fluid of the nerves is compo&s;ed of a two-fold &s;ub|&s;tance: of a &s;pirituous and extremely &s;ub|til part, called <HI>animal &s;pirits;</HI> and of a ge|latinous juice, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the <HI>nervous lymph.</HI></P>
<P>This gelatinous lymph, &s;erves as a vehicle to the animal &s;pirits, and being a&s;&s;imilated with the nerves, is tran&s;|formed into their &s;ub&s;tance and becomes &s;olid, like the vi&s;cous lymph of which the &s;pider forms its web, when conden&s;ed by the compre&s;&s;ion of the air.</P>
<P>As it is evident that the nervous fluid is in&s;en&s;ible, how can the nervous lymph, by
<PB N="69" REF="76">being a&s;&s;imilated into the &s;ub&s;tance of the nerves, become a &s;en&s;ible &s;olid? I mu&s;t leave this phenomena to be accounted for by tho&s;e who may be willing to undertake the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>With regard to the animal &s;pirits, it is uncertain, whether a &s;ub&s;tance &s;o &s;ubtil can be incorporated and become part of our &s;olids. I incline to the negative, &s;ince no human art can fix it: it is moreover &s;o volatile, that it could not be contained in any of our ve&s;&s;els, unle&s;s confined by &s;ome vi&s;cous fluid.</P>

<P>The nerves, as it is well known, are the organs of &s;en&s;e and motion: only the coats of their fibres are the organ<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See a preceding &s;ection, on the &s;tructure of the nerves.</NOTE>, and &s;eat of &s;en&s;e independently of their cavity, whether we con&s;ider them as filled with

<P>What terrible di&s;orders en&s;ue from the bite of a viper, of a mad dog, or the ap|plication of a cau&s;tic body to an excoriat|ed nerve! Palene&s;s, nau&s;eas, vomitings, difficult re&s;piration, cold &s;weats, convul|&s;ions, burning, and inflammatory &s;evers, retention of urine, &s;yncopes, a &s;pa&s;mus
<PB N="73" REF="80">of the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem, and univer|&s;al numbne&s;s are the u&s;ual concomitants.</P>
<P>Yet, when a &s;harp or pointed in&s;tru|ment wounds a nervous part, and occa&s;i|ons therein a &s;olution of continuity, much wor&s;e effects will en&s;ue. A &s;imple punc|ture of a tendon by a needle, is followed with the mo&s;t deplorable &s;ymptoms: there are many other ob&s;ervations, which may be made, of this kind.</P>
<P>All the&s;e alarming phenomena are pro|duced by the irritability of the nervous &s;y&s;tem: the nerves we know are extreme|ly &s;en&s;ible, they cannot endure the lea&s;t irritation; &s;o that when any thing affects them with a painful &s;en&s;ation, either by compre&s;&s;ing, &s;training, wounding them and the like, immediately they contract and are convul&s;ed. This contraction and convul&s;ive motion are in&s;tantly communi|cated to the neighbouring parts, then to the next, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to all the parts, till they comprehend the whole; from whence en&s;ue a con&s;iderable di&s;order in the circulation, a very great di&s;tention and ob&s;truction of the ve&s;&s;els, and a violent inflammation, with all the dreadful &s;ymp|toms which accompany a di&s;ordered &s;tate
<PB N="74" REF="81">of the functions of the animal oeconomy. This is a fre&s;h proof, that all the pheno|mena of this oeconomy have &s;en&s;e and mo|tion for their origin, as has been already mentioned.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider in what manner the irritation of one part is communicated to all the others, we are obliged, by the facts, to admit a reciprocal corre&s;ponden|cy between them by the medium of the nerves; but the di&s;&s;ecting knife, and the micro&s;cope, make this connection evident to the &s;ight.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here de&s;cant on the wonder|ful connexion between the nervous parts; I leave that ta&s;k to tho&s;e who are fond of the declamatory &s;tile, and &s;hall confine my&s;elf wholly to give a &s;uccinct idea of it. I beg pardon of my readers, for detain|ing them on a &s;ubject &s;o dry as this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be; I know how much it is my intere&s;t to pre&s;ent none but agreeable &s;ubjects, and to &s;et off philo&s;ophical enqui|ries with the embelli&s;hments of art; but this &s;ubject is connected with my work, and will admit of no foreign ornaments.</P>
<P>If we follow the nerves from their ori|gin to their extremities, we &s;hall ob&s;erve
<PB N="75" REF="82">them to branch out into infinite ramifica|tions in pa&s;&s;ing from the brain, and in their di&s;tributions to the different parts of the body, &s;omewhat re&s;embling the branches of a tree.</P>
<P>Here then we evidently &s;ee a double re|lation, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, on one hand, between every part of the body and the membranes of the brain; and on the other, recipro|cally between all the parts of the body. As it is not &s;ufficient barely to mention the&s;e relations in the general, I &s;hall offer an example of them.</P>
<P>Anatomi&s;ts have di&s;tingui&s;hed the nerves, relatively to their origin, into different cla&s;&s;es, which they have ranged under dif|ferent denominations: I &s;hall make u&s;e of the common terms, that I may render my work intelligible to my readers, the&s;e parts not being any otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;he.</P>
<P>The interco&s;tal nerve is formed of three branches: the fifth, &s;ixth, and eight pairs, &s;upply each a &s;ingle branch.</P>
<P>The branch of the fifth pair &s;ends out ramifications to the tongue, to the eye, to the jaws, to the cheek, and to the other parts of the face. The branch of the eighth pair, di&s;tributes &s;ome of its
<PB N="76" REF="83">ramifications to the tongue, to the pharinx, to the oe&s;ophagus, to the &s;tomach and to the lungs. The interco&s;tal nerve al&s;o com|municates in the cavity of the thorax, and abdomen, with &s;ome other ramifications of the eighth pair, and is augmented with &s;ome branches which ri&s;e from the me|dulla &s;pinalis, and pa&s;s between the ribs. Thus we perceive a very intimate connec|tion betwixt all the&s;e parts: this is the rea&s;on why aliments, which are ungrateful to the ta&s;te, occa&s;ion a nau&s;ea and contrac|tion of the oe&s;ophagus; why the touching of the root of the tongue with a feather, excites vomiting; and why wounds of the head, or a corro&s;ion of the inte&s;tines by worms, occa&s;ion difficult re&s;piration, vomiting, a cough, dumbne&s;s, and dreadful convul&s;i|ons of the whole machine.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the olfactory nerve, there en|ters into the no&s;e a branch of the ophthal|mic. The communication of the&s;e two nerves is the cau&s;e why &s;trong &s;mells ex|cite tears, and a &s;trong light occa&s;ions &s;neezing: the ophthalmic nerve being join|ed to the nerves of the thorax when vio|lently affected, excites, in the organs of
<PB N="77" REF="84">re&s;piration, the convul&s;ive motion, term|ed &s;neezing.</P>
<P>But this branch of the ophthalmic ends not at the organ of &s;melling, it is conti|nued to the teguments of the <HI>orbiculus na&s;i,</HI> or tip of the no&s;e, whence it is reverted to the internal &s;urface of the &s;eptum. This branch ari&s;es from the fifth pair, as does the lingual maxillary: hence the rea&s;on why mu&s;tard applied to the tongue cau&s;es a pungent &s;en&s;ation at the tip of the no&s;e, and excites a flux of tears. By this con|nection likewi&s;e, we may account for that titillation which is perceived in the no&s;e, when the worms contained in the inte&s;|tines, corrode and irritate the membranes of the&s;e vi&s;cera.</P>
<P>The nerves of the fifth and eighth pair, with the interco&s;tal, &s;upply the in|te&s;tines and &s;tomach: a branch of the fifth pair, as has been already ob&s;erved, &s;ends forth its ramifications to all the parts of the face: a branch of the eighth, &s;ends forth part of its ramifications to the liver and biliar duct; whil&s;t the interco&s;tal &s;up|plies the legs with the <HI>anticum</HI> and <HI>po&s;ti|cum.</HI> The inte&s;tines are a continuation of the coats of the &s;tomach; they ma|ny
<PB N="78" REF="85">nerves which are common to both, and by means of the me&s;enteric plexus, of the interco&s;tal and the <HI>par vagum,</HI> communni|cate with all the membranes of the body. There is therefore an intimate connexion between the&s;e vi&s;cera, and all the other parts of the animal machine: hence dentition occa&s;ions vomitings, difficult re&s;piration, &s;uffocation, coughs, inte&s;tinal flux, fever, and univer&s;al convul&s;ions. Hence, in the hypochondriac di&s;ea&s;e, the violent ten&s;ion of the membranes of the &s;tomach, occa|&s;ioned by the inclo&s;ed air, produces pains in the head and &s;houlders, vomitings, ver|tigos, dimne&s;s of &s;ight, languor, anxiety, palpitation of the heart, and a total di&s;|order of the vital functions. Hence cold|ne&s;s of the feet, and hurts of the extremi|ties, bring on violent cholics, and &s;ometimes the <HI>&s;pa&s;mus cynicus.</HI> This is the rea&s;on why the irritation of the &s;tomach by cor|ro&s;ive poi&s;ons, and of the inte&s;tines by worms, acrid bile, or dra&s;tic purges, is followed by a convul&s;ive hiccough, diffi|cult re&s;piration, dumbne&s;s, coughs, pal|pitation of the heart, pains in the &s;ide, vomitings, flux of the &s;aliva, violent pains in the inte&s;tines, palene&s;s, coldne&s;s in the
<PB N="79" REF="86">extremities, univer&s;al tremor, retention of urine, a tene&s;mus, hollowne&s;s of the eyes, contraction of the lips, mouth, and other parts of the face, &s;pa&s;ms of the limbs, fever, vertigo, gutta &s;erena, and many other dreadful &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>I could enlarge upon this &s;ubject, but I fear I have already been too diffu&s;e. Should any of my readers be de&s;irous of more information, I recommend to him the peru&s;al of the Neurology of <HI>Vieu&s;&s;en</HI>'s and <HI>Jenty,</HI> where this &s;ubject is treated in its full extent: the ob&s;ervations I have made will &s;uffice to e&s;tabli&s;h the following propo&s;ition as a general law, which I &s;hall make u&s;e of as I proceed; it is this.</P>
<P><HI>All the parts of the body communicate with the membranes of the brain by the nerves, and with one another by common nervous ramifications.</HI></P>
<P>Although all the parts of the body are connected with the membranes of the brain, that connection is not equal in eve|ry one. For &s;eeing that the nerves are the productions of the meninges, and as their impre&s;&s;ions are communicated by the mo|tion of the nervous fluid, it is evident, that the more remote a nerve is from its
<PB N="80" REF="87">origin, the le&s;s intimate that connexion mu&s;t be: but &s;uppo&s;ing the di&s;tance to be the &s;ame, it is likewi&s;e evident, that the connexion of the&s;e two organs mu&s;t be the more clo&s;e, when they have a greater number of nerves common to both. In a word, as the nerves do not form an uniform cylindrical duct, from the trunk to the extremity of their ramifications, and as a great number ri&s;e from the gan|glions, we may ea&s;ily conceive, that the more a nerve &s;hall form a continued whole, the greater will be the relation betwixt the&s;e organs. Thus there is no connection be|tween the brain and the &s;anguineous vi&s;|cera, the &s;ub&s;tance of which is purely va&s;cular, &s;uch as the liver, &s;pleen, &amp;c. nei|ther can any &s;en&s;ation pa&s;s to the <HI>&s;en&s;orium commune,</HI> through their numerous circum|volutions.</P>

<HEAD>Particular Ob&s;ervations on the Influx of the nervous Fluid into the Organs of Motion.</HEAD>
<P>When you cut off the head of mo&s;t ani|mals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;t per&s;ons have &s;een a duck, when its head has been &s;eparated from its body, run about for &s;everal mi|nutes: a viper or &s;nake will move a con&s;iderable time after decapitation; and flies, an entire day. Among all the animals, Man is that in which this phenomenon the lea&s;t appears.</NOTE>, you perceive the limbs to move
<PB N="81" REF="88">for &s;ome time after the amputation: how|ever, the&s;e animals &s;oon die; their bo|dies, when deprived of their heads, after a few efforts, lo&s;e their motion for ever. If this experiment proves the nece&s;&s;ity of a connection of the mu&s;cular parts with the brain, it proves likewi&s;e, that this con|nection is not e&s;&s;ential to every motion in particular. The&s;e motions therefore take place when there is not any in&s;tantaneous influx of the nervous fluid into the mu&s;|cles. Hence it appears, that this fluid continues for &s;ome time in the organ of motion, and to act needs not any impul&s;e immediately propagated from the brain. When once impelled into the mu&s;cular fibres, it follows the ordinary laws of cir|culation; it continues there a &s;hort time, and is then taken up by the lymphatics, or di&s;&s;ipated by per&s;piration.</P>
<P>The continuance of the nervous fluid, in the mu&s;cular fibres, is in proportion to the degree of vi&s;co&s;ity of the nervous lymph. The more gelatinous that lymph
<PB N="82" REF="89">may be, the continuance will be the greater. Thus vipers, eels, &s;nails and other animals, who&s;e nervous lymph is extremely vi&s;cous and very little per&s;pira|ble, are with difficulty de&s;troyed. The ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with animals of a &s;an|guine and hot temperament, who&s;e li|quors are extremely fluid, circulation quick, and per&s;piration copious, as man, hor&s;es, dogs, &amp;c. In the&s;e the nervous lymph is very &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated, and there is a continual call for reparation. But in every &s;pecies of the&s;e animals, the mo|mentary independance, which is ob&s;erved between the motions of the mu&s;cles, and the influx of the nervous fluid from the brain, does not prevent the cau&s;e, which intercepts this connexion, from totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e motions at their &s;ource.</P>
<P>It is different with regard to tho&s;e animals, which have not any blood, and which have no brain, nor any organs of dige&s;tion, all who&s;e liquors are nothing more than the nervous lymph it&s;elf, and that of a very glutinous con&s;i&s;tence; &s;uch animals drawing their nouri&s;hment from the place to which they have been originally fixed,
<PB N="83" REF="90">like the polypus and the oy&s;ter: be&s;ides, as no part of their bodies appears to want the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other, they can live after mutilation, and reproduce them|&s;elves; &s;o that from their very de&s;truction they &s;eem to derive the means by which they are perpetuated.</P>
<P>What I have ju&s;t &s;aid of the influx of the nervous fluid mu&s;t, however, be un|der&s;tood only of involuntary motion: &s;ince the &s;eat of the &s;oul is in the meninges, the &s;oul has no power over the body, af|ter the head is &s;eparated therefrom.</P>
<P>From the foregoing I infer, that if the ob&s;ervations here made prove the nece&s;&s;ity of the connexion &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the head and the trunk, it is becau&s;e the head is the re&s;ervoir of the nervous fluid.</P>

<HEAD>Nece&s;&s;ity of the arterial <HI>BLOOD</HI> to <HI>MO|TION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The nerves are not the only parts ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the functions of the mu&s;cles: the arterial blood likewi&s;e contributes to their motion.</P>
<P>If the artery, which &s;upplies a mu&s;cle with blood, be clo&s;ely tied above its in|&s;ertion,
<PB N="84" REF="91">that mu&s;cle will gradually<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In ten, fifteen, or twenty minutes, according a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the animal may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of blood, &s;trength, &amp;c.</NOTE> be|come paralytic; at fir&s;t it will be numbed and &s;tiff, and by degrees will be motion|le&s;s. This experiment proves the nece&s;|&s;ity of the arterial blood to mu&s;cular mo|tion, and of the connexion of the heart with the mu&s;cles by means of the arte|ries. The arterial blood is nece&s;&s;ary to mu&s;cular motion as an immediate cau&s;e, but not as an in&s;tantaneous one; &s;ince the mu&s;cle, in the foregoing experiment, con|tinues its motion many minutes after the influx of the blood is intercepted.</P>
<P>But how does the arterial blood con|duce to the motion of the mu&s;cles? To me it appears to be done many ways.</P>
<P>We know that the cold air renders the fibres numb and &s;tiff by fixing their fluid; this fluid therefore hath occa&s;ion for heat; and as the blood in circulation is the prin|ciple of natural heat, it is therefore cer|tain, that the nervous lymph requires the circulation of our fluids, in order to pre|&s;erve the fluidity nece&s;&s;ary to the functions of our organs. The arterial blood therefore is a&s;&s;i&s;tant to mu&s;cular motion, as being the principle of heat. It is &s;aid, that the heat of
<PB N="85" REF="92">fire does not re&s;tore motion to paralytic mu&s;cles. We are to ob&s;erve, that the heat of fire is not a &s;uitable &s;ub&s;titute; the heat of the blood is di&s;&s;olvent, and adap|ted to liquify the gelatinous lymph; the heat of fire is only calculated to dry it: therefore it is not at all &s;trange, that the heat of fire, &s;ub&s;tituted in lieu of the heat of the blood, does not re&s;tore life to pa|ralytic mu&s;cles. But &s;uppo&s;ing this to be a &s;uitable &s;ub&s;titute, what will thence follow, but that the arterial blood is not a&s;&s;i&s;tant to motion, merely as the princi|ple of heat? Let us enquire then in what other manner it can be a&s;&s;i&s;tant thereto.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the nervous fluid is the principle of vigor and of &s;trength to the body, that the <HI>cerebrum</HI> is its filtre, and the <HI>cerebellum</HI> its re&s;ervoir. It is cer|tain, likewi&s;e, that &s;ome animals, like the mule and the a&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;s extreme &s;trength, and endure fatigue for a con&s;i|derale length of time; yet the cerebrum and cerebellum of the&s;e animals are very &s;mall, if compared to the &s;ame parts in Man, and in many other animals, which po&s;&s;e&s;s a much &s;maller degree of &s;trength. Whence does this proceed, but from &s;ome
<PB N="86" REF="93">difference in the formation of the organs of motion, or in the liquors which &s;upply the nervous fluid? To di&s;cover this di&s;&s;i|militude, let us chu&s;e, from among qua|drupeds, that animal which neare&s;t re|&s;embles a mule, as for in&s;tance, the hor&s;e; let them be of the &s;ame age, the &s;ame &s;ize, and, as far as it is po&s;&s;ible, be both equal.</P>
<P>On comparing the&s;e two animals with|out di&s;&s;ection, we perceive at fir&s;t &s;ight a very great di&s;&s;imilitude. The limbs of the mule are &s;maller than the limbs of the hor&s;e, the head longer, the legs &s;maller and of a greater length, and the &s;ides le&s;s protuberant. On examining the internal parts, we find the mu&s;cles of the mule &s;maller than tho&s;e of the hor&s;e, but its va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem larger, the lungs of great|er bulk, and the &s;olids of a &s;ub&s;tance &s;omewhat more compact. The cau&s;e of its greater &s;trength, ari&s;es then principally from its having a greater &s;upply of ner|vous lymph from the ma&s;s of its fluids. The blood of tho&s;e animals &s;upplies the nervous fibres with a greater quantity of this active fluid; this &s;ub&s;titute is nece&s;|&s;ary in tho&s;e large bodies, who&s;e motions are con&s;iderable, and brain very &s;mall,
<PB N="87" REF="94">and con&s;equently incapable of &s;upplying any great quantity of it. This is the ca&s;e of almo&s;t all quadrupeds; they have a large quantity of blood, large lungs, and an abundant &s;upply of the nervous fluid. On the contrary, in all the animals which have only the gelatinous lymph, this &s;ub|&s;titute, which is extracted from the blood, and even the blood it&s;elf, is not any ways nece&s;&s;ary; nor has nature &s;upplied them with it.</P>
<P>Let us proceed yet farther, and endea|vour to prove by ocular demon&s;tration, what we have now been advancing on the te&s;timony of facts.</P>
<P>We have &s;aid, that the nerves are the organs of motion; but the mu&s;cles are &s;o in a more particular manner.</P>
<P>In a mu&s;cle we di&s;tingui&s;h its body and its two extremities; the body of a mu&s;|cle is entirely carnous; one of the extre|mities, which is commonly termed the head of the mu&s;cle, is almo&s;t an entire fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance; the other extremity, called its tail, is perfectly tendinous.</P>
<P>The body of the mu&s;cle is compo&s;ed of many <HI>fa&s;ciculi</HI> of fibres, ranged in two dif|ferent orders.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="95">Each of the&s;e orders is enveloped with its peculiar membrane, and the entire mu&s;cle with a common coat, which com|bines the whole. Every one of the&s;e <HI>fa&s;ciculi</HI> is compo&s;ed of mu&s;cular fibres, ten times &s;maller than the fine&s;t hair, as is ob&s;erved by <HI>Muys</HI> and <HI>Lewenhoeck.</HI></P>
<P>When examined by the micro&s;cope im|mediately after they are extracted from the body of a living animal, the&s;e fibres appear to be formed of ve&s;icles, and re|&s;emble a tube full of a limpid liquor, al|ternately compo&s;ed of globules of liquor, and globules of air. See fig. 1.</P>
<P>After the&s;e globules have di&s;appeared, and the liquor is either congealed or di&s;&s;i|pated, the fibre appears to have an uniform cavity, but filled with a kind of reticular web, formed of many little cells adjoin|ing to each other, and united by many tran&s;ver&s;e <HI>fibrillae.</HI> See fig. 2.</P>
<P>The mu&s;cular <HI>fa&s;ciculi,</HI> examined with the micro&s;cope, appear to be formed of many parallel contiguous fibres, bound together by a number of filaments, and much re&s;emble a net. The&s;e fibres form ana&s;tomo&s;es, and are blended in many places after the &s;ame manner with the cel|lular

</FIGURE>
<PB N="89" REF="97">threads in the divi&s;ion of the inte|rior part of a fibre, as repre&s;ented in fig. 2. The net, which combines the mu&s;cular fibres, appears to be formed of ramifica|tions of nerves, arteries, and the ve&s;&s;els which enter the mu&s;cle. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els and nervous ramifications in particular, when they enter that organ, appear to be dive&s;ted of part of their external coats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Viz. Tho&s;e which they receive from the <HI>dura mater.</HI></NOTE>. So that the general covering of the mu&s;|cle is formed of the coats of the fir&s;t ra|mifications, and cellular membranes of the neighbouring parts: the covering of the <HI>fa&s;ciculi</HI> of the fir&s;t order is a conti|nuation of the coats of the ramifications of the &s;econd: the covering of the <HI>fa&s;ci|culi</HI> of the &s;econd order is a continuation of the coats of the ramifications of the third; and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It appears, likewi&s;e, that the la&s;t rami|fications or nervous <HI>fibrillae</HI> them&s;elves, which are the ducts continued from the <HI>pia mater</HI> form ana&s;tomo&s;es with the mu&s;|cular fibres which they unite to and in|crea&s;e, impelling at the &s;ame time into the cavity of the&s;e fibres that fluid which they contain. But the&s;e ramifications,
<PB N="90" REF="98">when dive&s;ted of their external coat, form not the mu&s;cular fibres: it is very evident from the di&s;&s;ection of the mu&s;cles, that they are already formed before the nerve enters them. In the mu&s;cle of the eye, for in&s;tance, the branches of the third, fourth, and &s;ixth pairs, are in&s;erted at a great di&s;tance from the origin of the&s;e mu&s;cles; and that portion of them, which is above their in&s;ertion, cannot have been formed by the&s;e nerves, all who&s;e fibres tend toward the eyes. But if that portion has &s;ome other origin, the whole mu&s;cle mu&s;t have the &s;ame likewi&s;e: &s;ince the coat of that organ is only a continuation of the fibres of that part, and that portion it&s;elf is evidently the continuation of a tendinous expan&s;ion of the <HI>perio&s;teum,</HI> the fibres of which, being dilated and united to the va&s;cular and nervous ramifications, form that fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance, called the belly of the mu&s;cle, and which is properly the organ of motion.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, that the mu&s;cular fibres, when they approach a tendon, are directed to it as to a centre; and it appears, that the whiti&s;h &s;ub&s;tance, which commonly terminates a mu&s;cle, is a continuation of
<PB N="91" REF="99">the carnous fibres of its body, who&s;e &s;ub|&s;tance is too compact to admit the red part of the blood.</P>
<P>We may perceive likewi&s;e, in di&s;&s;ecting a foetus, that the extremities of the mu&s;|cles are a continuation of the perio&s;teum; the &s;ame may be remarked in adults, when the parts have been macerated in water; and it is known, that the perio&s;teum takes its origin from the <HI>dura mater.</HI> Be&s;ides it is evident, that the branches of the nerves, which are in&s;erted into the mu&s;cles, have not a &s;ufficient &s;ub&s;tance to form organs of &s;o large a bulk. The mu&s;cle is there|fore a part entirely nervous, and receives its origin mediately or immediately from the <HI>dura mater.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing is more &s;imple, than the for|mation of the&s;e organs by the nervous fi|bres. When the&s;e fibres are &s;o compact as not to receive the red part of the blood, and admit the fluid of the nerves only, they form the white &s;ub&s;tance at the ex|tremity of the mu&s;cle. But when their diameter is &s;ufficiently large to receive a great quantity of the nervous fluid, and when their inter&s;tices are &s;ufficiently di|lated to admit the reticular plexus of
<PB N="92" REF="100">nerves, &s;mall arteries and veins, which co|vers and unites them, they form the mu&s;|cular fibres which compo&s;e the body of the mu&s;cle. This formation is very evi|dent in the frontal and occipital mu&s;cles, in tho&s;e of the outward ear, in tho&s;e of the face, and in the mu&s;cular fibres of the ganglions.</P>
<P>It is proved by injection, that the blood ve&s;&s;els extend their ramifications through the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e fibres. If the arteries of a mu&s;cle be injected with any coloured oily liquor, the liquor will &s;omewhat dilate the mu&s;cle, but will not be perceived in the cavity of the fibres, for they ever retain their tran&s;parency.</P>
<P>The fibres of a mu&s;cle neverthele&s;s in|crea&s;e in bulk, which could not be unle&s;s they received a &s;ubtil lymph by their fi|brillae. The &s;anguiniferous ve&s;&s;els there|fore di&s;charge into the cavity of the&s;e fi|bres a &s;pirituous lymph analogous to that of the nerves.</P>
<P>Hence the arterial blood conduces to mu&s;cular motion, as the cau&s;e of that heat which is nece&s;&s;ary to the fluidity of the nervous lymph, and as the &s;ource of that &s;pirituous lymph which is &s;ub&s;tituted
<PB N="93" REF="101">in place of the nervous fluid. It is by this mechani&s;m that the ligature of the artery, which is in&s;erted into a mu&s;cle, deprives that mu&s;cle of its motion; but it is not certain that this is owing to the&s;e cau&s;es only. It may be, that the &s;angui|niferous ve&s;&s;els of this mu&s;cle, when relax|ed by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the arterial blood, having le&s;&s;ened the bulk of this mu&s;cle, con|tinue it in a relaxed &s;tate, and prevent the free cour&s;e of the nervous fluid into its ducts.</P>
<P>Or perhaps a compre&s;&s;ion of the nerve, above its in&s;ertion into the mu&s;cle, occa|&s;ioned by the di&s;ten&s;ion of the ob&s;tructed artery, prevents &s;uch an influx. Whether it be &s;o or not, the two rea&s;ons, which we have drawn from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ar|terial blood to mu&s;cular motion, are &s;uffi|cient to e&s;tabli&s;h the con&s;equences which I &s;hall deduce therefrom in the remaining part of this work.</P>

<HEAD>Of the different Motions of the <HI>BODY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We di&s;tingui&s;h at fir&s;t fight in every animal, but more evidently in Man, two different kinds of motion; the purely vo|luntary, and the purely mechanical.</P>
<P>Voluntary motions have a character &s;uf|ficiently di&s;tinct, without our undertaking to explain them; as to involuntary mo|tions, we mu&s;t range them into this order, viz. the action of the organs of life, and the action of the organs of dige&s;tion: we may here likewi&s;e range the functions of tho&s;e organs, which pre&s;erve the body in a &s;tate of health, all tho&s;e motions which follow every particular attitude of the body, in &s;hort, all which are the effects of the action of external objects on the machine, &s;uch as convul&s;ions, &s;pa&s;ms, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have already &s;hewn, that the nervous fluid is the principle of motion; but al|though this fluid be the immediate agent in all the motions of the body, it acts not always in the &s;ame manner: at one time it is independent in its operation, at other times it is &s;ubordinate to the &s;oul. I would extend my arm, and immediate|ly my arm is extended; but &s;hould I will
<PB N="95" REF="103">that my pul&s;e &s;hould cea&s;e to beat, and my heart di&s;continue its motion, &s;uch a volition would avail nothing; my pul&s;e will continue to beat, and my heart re|tain its motion, independent of my will, and in oppo&s;ition thereto. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, I perceive a power which commands, and a power which obeys: in the la&s;t, I perceive a power which acts independently, and even contrary to the will of the com|manding power.</P>
<P>Let us here dwell for a moment on the&s;e con&s;iderations, and we may draw from them the&s;e conclu&s;ions, which we &s;hall lay down as general laws of the mechani&s;m of the human body.</P>
<P><HI>In all voluntary motions, the nervous fluid is &s;ubordinate to the &s;oul, and becomes the in&s;trument &s;he u&s;es in performing them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In all involuntary motions the nervous fluid is the principal agent, and, combined with the various organs which it animates, performs independantly all the&s;e motions.</HI></P>
<P>And here, if I might be allowed to make a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion, I would ob&s;erve, that in this law, which renders the life of the body independent of the &s;oul, appears the
<PB N="96" REF="104">tender care of Nature, anxious, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, to pre&s;erve its work.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we live upon this earth, where our exi&s;tence is nece&s;&s;arily divided betwixt plea&s;ure and pain, what man is there who does not, in tho&s;e moments of &s;ad|ne&s;s and di&s;appointment, which &s;o fre|quently a&s;&s;ail us, impatiently wi&s;h for a di&s;&s;olution; and who would not cea&s;e to live, if his exi&s;tence depended upon a &s;in|gle act of the will? By not permitting us thus to terminate our mi&s;ery, Nature has wi&s;ely re&s;erved to us the means of reco|vering the wonted equilibrium of our minds; and by the gha&s;tly and terrifying form of death, e&s;pecially a violent one, in&s;tead of a propen&s;ity, &s;he has implanted in us an horror of &s;uicide; and pre&s;erves our being by an unconquerable antipathy to pain.</P>
<P>I have di&s;tingui&s;hed in every animal two kinds of motion, the one purely volun|tary, the other altogether mechanical: but he mu&s;t never have made any ob&s;er|vations upon Man, who has not ob&s;erved many actions, which cannot be ranged under either of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es. Among the&s;e are bodily habits, occa&s;ioned by the &s;ame &s;e|ries
<PB N="97" REF="105">of motives frequently repeated in the &s;ame order, either accidentally or with de|&s;ign&mdash;Such as tho&s;e habits we contract by art.

<P>All the&s;e movements are performed by an infinite number of &s;mall mu&s;cles, which the will has power to &s;et in moti|on, but which in this ca&s;e do not &s;tay for its command<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the performer fir&s;t begins to practi&s;e the&s;e motions, he has occa&s;ion for the action of the will every moment, to di&s;po&s;e them in their proper order, and his &s;oul is &s;carcely able to direct &s;o prodigious a number of mu&s;cles, which in this ca&s;e act clum&s;ily and irregularly.

<P><PB N="99" REF="107">An ob&s;ervation, which mu&s;t doubtle&s;s have occurred to the reader, is, that our organs not only perform &s;uch motions, but are &s;o many mechanical in&s;truments, which are &s;et in motion by the other faculties of the &s;oul: for not only the will gives the fir&s;t impul&s;e to our or|gans; every different faculty of the &s;oul acts on them in its turn; &s;ometimes they are wrought on by &s;en&s;ibility, &s;ometimes by in&s;tinct, and &s;ometimes by the imagina|tion: whence it follows, that the nervous fluid is immediately &s;ubject to every one of the&s;e faculties.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e &s;tartings, which are occa&s;ioned by any &s;udden and violent noi&s;e, in the lineaments which are impre&s;&s;ed on the countenance in the different pa&s;&s;ions, in that oratorial action which accompanies an animated &s;peech, it is the &s;oul, or ra|ther it is its &s;en&s;ibility only, which agi|tates the body.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e loathings and antipathies which &s;eize us at the &s;ight of any of|fen&s;ive aliment, in the horror excited by any &s;hocking action, it is the imagination which affects our inte&s;tines, and occa&s;ions convul&s;ive motions in them.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="108">The motions which tend to pre&s;erve the equilibrium of the body, when it inclines from its center of gravity, and the actions of an infant, which precede all know|ledge, and even the gradual unfolding of the intellect, have their &s;ource neither in the will, nor in the imagination; and &s;pring neither from &s;en&s;ibility nor from mechanical laws, but from in&s;tinct acting on our organs.</P>
<P>Let us admire the wi&s;dom of Nature's laws, &s;een in the manner wherein the dif|ferent &s;piritual faculties of Man concur to all his actions.</P>
<P>Without this wonderful concurrence, to what a &s;tate &s;hould we be reduced? Continually obliged to call in the will and the under&s;tanding to direct our bodily ac|tions, and even our minute&s;t motions; our lives would be at an end before we could accompli&s;h any one purpo&s;e: nor would the &s;oul, thus &s;ub&s;ervient to the nece&s;&s;ities and motions of the body, have lei&s;ure to enlarge its faculties; and tho&s;e noble endowments, this <HI>divinae particula aurae,</HI> would have remained for ever in a &s;tate of inaction.

<P>I &s;hall conclude this article, with &s;ome particular ob&s;ervations on voluntary mo|tions.</P>
<P>We can, in obedience to the will, con|tract or relax a mu&s;cle with a&s;toni&s;hing celerity, or by gradations more or le&s;s protracted. How does the nervous fluid produce that &s;urprizing action of the mu&s;|cles, in which motion and re&s;t alternative|ly &s;ucceed each other in the &s;ame in&s;tant? This problem, if it can be re&s;olved, is not connected with my pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>We have &s;een that a ligature of the duct of the <HI>medulla &s;pinalis,</HI> is followed by a paralytic affection of all the parts of the body which are &s;ituated below it; that the &s;oul cannot then contract nor relax any of the mu&s;cles of the&s;e paralytic parts; we have &s;een that the &s;eat of the &s;oul is in the meninges; <HI>all voluntary motions are therefore made by the in&s;tantaneous influx of the nervous fluid into the mu&s;cles.</HI></P>
<P>I beg the reader to con&s;ider this not in the light of an hypothe&s;is, but as an un|que&s;tionable
<PB N="102" REF="110">truth e&s;tabli&s;hed upon facts. Some pretend, neverthele&s;s, that this in|&s;tantaneous influx is a chimera; <Q>Since, &s;ay they, animals have been &s;een to live, walk, and perform all their functions after their heads were taken off.</Q> But what they ought to have done, but did not dare to undertake, was to have &s;hewn in all the&s;e pretended functions, &s;ome act of volition, &s;ome action which had an aim or &s;cope, or which tended to &s;ome vi&s;ible end. Animal life, is a function independant of the &s;oul; and walking or flying, when they have no tendency to any end, are no more than continuations of motions which are purely mechanical, and are produced in this ca&s;e by the convul&s;ions of an irritated &s;en&s;ible &s;ub&s;tance?</P>
<P>Another ob&s;ervation which depends up|on the preceding, and which we &s;hall apply hereafter, is, that all involuntary motions, &s;uch as tho&s;e which con&s;titute life, being independant of the immediate influx of the nervous fluid, <HI>there is requir|ed a le&s;s quantity of that fluid to perform them, than to perform tho&s;e which depend on a determination of the will.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="111">We might likewi&s;e confirm this truth by the force of the contraction of the or|gans allotted for voluntary motion, com|pared with the force of the contraction of tho&s;e organs which perform only mechani|cal movements. That the force of this contraction is proportioned to the quanti|ty of the nervous fluid, may be proved from the &s;trength of animals, in which this fluid abounds, compared with the langour of a body which has been deprived of it. This is the rea&s;on, why, in aged per&s;ons, life &s;urvives the total extinction of &s;trength, and why, in bodies worn out by &s;ickne&s;s, the organs of life are the la&s;t which lo&s;e their motion.</P>

<P>The organs of motion are compo&s;ed of mu&s;cular fibres, which are them&s;elves compo&s;ed of organic fibres, or fibrillae.</P>
<P>During the life of any animal, the ner|vous fluid, which is continually circulat|ing through its fibres, fills them to a cer|tain degree, &s;upporting their coats which are thus in a certain degree of ten&s;ion. This continual ten&s;ion is termed <HI>the natu|ral tone of the &s;olids.</HI></P>

<PB N="105" REF="113">that the ela&s;ticity of the fibres<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The nerves are extremely ela&s;tic, although cer|tain philo&s;ophers affirm the contrary.

It is perceived, by depre&s;&s;ing the carnous parts of the body in a &s;tate of health; but e&s;pecially by examining fibres which are affected with a &s;light inflammation. The gelatinous &s;ub&s;tance of which they are formed, and into which they are re&s;olved, is extremely ela&s;tic; and are not the &s;trings of mu&s;ical in&s;truments which are &s;o exceedingly ela&s;tic, nervous &s;ub&s;tances?</NOTE> which form the &s;ub&s;tance of the nerves and mu&s;|cles, is proportioned, like that of all ela&s;|tic bodies, to the form of their con&s;tituent parts, to the den&s;ity of their &s;ub&s;tance, and to their diameter: in a word, to their geometrical dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P>Let us leave that undeterminable que&s;|tion concerning the infinite divi&s;ibility of matter; whatever may be the configu|ration of the elementary parts of bodies, it is certain, that there is a configuration of parts, which &s;trictly follows geometrical dimen&s;ions. The more oblong the&s;e par|ticles are, and the more they incline to an acute angle, the greater is the re&s;i&s;tance they make; the le&s;s ea&s;ily they can be &s;eparat|ed
<PB N="106" REF="114">one from another, the more ela&s;tic the &s;ub&s;tance they compo&s;e will be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I beg my reader to remember, that I &s;uppo&s;e an equality of the terms of compari&s;on, although I do not con&s;tantly expre&s;s it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the more clo&s;ely the particles, which form any body, are united, the greater re&s;i&s;tance it makes, and the more ela&s;tic it will be.</P>
<P>This very evidently appears in all bo|dies, which greatly abound with lymph: paper, when &s;oaked in water, is lax and &s;oft, but its ela&s;ticity returns when the water is evaporated.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame in regard to metals; by much beating, they are rendered more ela&s;tic. It is evident, in air of different temperature: and cold by conden&s;ing bo|dies, increa&s;es their ela&s;ticity; whil&s;t, on the contrary, heat dilates them and weak|ens it.</P>
<P>In their enquiries into the fir&s;t elements the &s;olid parts of the body, phy&s;iologi&s;ts have &s;uppo&s;ed all the&s;e organs to be formed of many minute nervous fibrillae, and have in&s;erred from the evidence of facts, that the&s;e fibrillae are compo&s;ed of others much more minute, but without
<PB N="107" REF="115">cavity, re&s;embling the filaments of &s;kins, which have been re&s;olved by maceration.</P>
<P>They a&s;&s;ign the&s;e fibrillae without a ca|vity, as the fir&s;t elements of our fibres; but it is evident, that they have for their principles the &s;ame elements with the nervous lymph, whereof all our &s;olids are compounded.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of the nerves and the mu&s;cular fibres being homogeneous, we may readily comprehend, that the different degrees of ela&s;ticity, deduced from the con|figuration of the elements of bodies, is not to be included in our calculation. As to the combination of the&s;e different ele|ments, it is certain, that the more com|pact the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;imple fibres, and of the fibrillae of the nerves, the more ela&s;tic they will be. This truth, which is confirmed by con&s;tant experience, is evident from theory it&s;elf: but tho&s;e which are to be deduced from geometrical dimen&s;ions are le&s;s evident, they appear not at fir&s;t &s;ight, and are not di&s;covered without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art.</P>
<P>The laws of the ela&s;ticity of bodies, which regard dimen&s;ions, are little, if at all known. This matter, I believe, has
<PB N="108" REF="116">not been yet treated of by any one; I &s;hall attempt to determine the&s;e laws in a clear and conci&s;e manner, but to perform it with the greater &s;ucce&s;s, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to examine the &s;ubject in its fulle&s;t extent.</P>
<P>In two bodies, the le&s;s the diameter of the one, the length in both being the &s;ame, &s;o much le&s;s is its &s;trength: al&s;o, the le&s;s the length of one of two bo|dies, their diameters being equal, the greater will be its &s;trength. Becau&s;e the elementary parts of bodies make le&s;s re|&s;i&s;tance in proportion as they are le&s;s &s;olid; and the le&s;s extended a body is in length, the more equal will its den&s;ity be in every part; &s;o that it makes, in all re&s;pects, a more equal re&s;i&s;tance, and con&s;equently yields the le&s;s to the pre&s;&s;ume of any power acting upon it. This is the rea&s;on why a &s;pherical figure is the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers have deduced from the&s;e ob&s;ervations the &s;ame con&s;equences with re|gard to the ela&s;ticity of bodies, which we have drawn from them in regard to their force; to me it appears, that, in this re|&s;pect, they have greatly erred.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="117">By <HI>ela&s;ticity,</HI> I mean that property by which certain bodies return to their primi|tive &s;tate, when the power which com|pre&s;&s;ed them cea&s;es to act on them.</P>
<P>Ela&s;ticity then is to be e&s;timated by the difference between the &s;pace, occupied by a compre&s;&s;ed body under pre&s;&s;ure, and that which it occupies when the pre&s;&s;ure cea&s;es; and by the &s;pace which the extre|mities of a body extended longitudinally, move from their natural po&s;ition, and not by the re&s;i&s;tance they make to this pre&s;|&s;ure. Otherwi&s;e a large oak, which the &s;tronge&s;t wind has not power to bend, would be more ela&s;tic than the reed, which yields without re&s;i&s;tance to the &s;lighte&s;t breath of air, and always returns to its former erect po&s;ition. Or, to make u&s;e of another example, a bar of &s;teel, which the &s;tronge&s;t arm cannot bend, &s;hall be more ela&s;tic than the &s;piral &s;pring of a watch, which ea&s;ily yields to the action of the moving power, and retains for many years its property of always returning to its primitive &s;tate. That body therefore is the mo&s;t ela&s;tic, which yields the mo&s;t to the pre&s;&s;ure of any power, and on which that power leaves the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="118">Not only the con&s;equences are fal&s;e which have been deduced from the ob&s;er|vations here given, but there appear be|tween the force of a body which depends on its dimen&s;ions, and its primitive ela&s;ti|city, relations of a quite contrary nature.</P>
<P>It is certain, that a &s;pherical figure is the &s;tronge&s;t; but take a body who&s;e &s;ub|&s;tance is the mo&s;t ela&s;tic, as for in&s;tance, &s;teel, fa&s;hion it into a globular form, and try if you can perceive in it the lea&s;t ela&s;|ticity.</P>
<P>A tennis ball can be no exception, if being an heterogeneous &s;ub&s;tance, com|po&s;ed of an infinite number of rectilinear and curvilinear longitudinally extended bo|dies, wound one upon the another, and included within a common covering. A bladder di&s;tended with air is not more con|clu&s;ive; for we are here &s;peaking of &s;o|lids, not of fluids. It will be equally im|pertinent to &s;ay, that a ball of marble, when forcibly impelled again&s;t another body of the &s;ame nature, rebounds with great force. Even &s;uppo&s;ing I cannot a&s;&s;ign any rea&s;on for this phenomena; what will you be advantaged thereby? It is plain, that to form a conclu&s;ion &s;ub|ver&s;ive
<PB N="111" REF="119">of the principle here e&s;tabli&s;hed, you mu&s;t prove that this phenomenon ari&s;es from the ela&s;ticity of the ball of mar|ble, and mu&s;t be attributed to its &s;pheric form, and not to the air as a medium, nor to any other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But take another piece of &s;teal, its length being three or four times its dia|meter, and you will perceive a &s;mall de|gree of ela&s;ticity. Lengthen this cylinder, pre&s;erving the &s;ame diameter, and you will perceive in every one the ela&s;ticity to increa&s;e with this dimen&s;ion. Select any ela&s;tic body you plea&s;e, the re&s;ults will be always the &s;ame. The ela&s;ticity of any body therefore increa&s;es in proportion as its &s;trength dimini&s;hes.</P>

That, <HI>In nervous fibres of an equal length, that which has the lea&s;t dia|meter has the greate&s;t ela&s;ticity; and among tho&s;e of an equal diameter, that which has the greate&s;t length has likewi&s;e the greate&s;t ela&s;ticity</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To prove the contrary, the in&s;tance of a watch &s;pring may be adduced, its ela&s;ticity being increa&s;ed by the cold, altho' it is neverthele&s;s &s;hortened. This ob&s;ervation is ju&s;t, but the con&s;equence fal&s;e. It is not by &s;hortening this &s;pring that the cold increa&s;es its ela&s;ticity, but by rendering its &s;ub&s;tance more compact. By being &s;hortened, its ela&s;ticity certainly is le&s;&s;ened; but is augmented by its &s;ub&s;tance being rendered more den&s;e. Thus the cold produces on ela&s;tic bodies two different effects, and on comparing them, we per|ceive, that ela&s;tic bodies gain thereby more than they lo&s;e; for, in order to weaken their ela&s;ticity, the cold acts only on one dimen&s;ion, but to &s;trengthen the ela&s;ticity, it acts upon all.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="120">Finally, an ob&s;ervation which at fir&s;t will appear &s;urprizing, and which is the re&s;ult of the preceding, is, <HI>that the ela&s;ti|city of a body of a large diameter is aug|mented in proportion to the loo&s;e connection of its con&s;tituent parts.</HI> Hence the rea&s;on why the organs of aged per&s;ons, by a con|tinual a&s;&s;imilation of the nervous lymph, become rigid and very little ela&s;tie. Hence likewi&s;e it is, that in per&s;ons of an ad|vanced age, the u&s;e of emollient liquors dilating the pores of the &s;olids, &s;omewhat re&s;tores their ela&s;ticity.</P>

<HEAD>Of the different Degrees of the organic Ela&s;|ticity of the <HI>FIBRES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This ela&s;ticity varies with the quality and quantity of the nervous fluid. We mu&s;t con&s;ider the quality of the nervous fluid in two different points of view, viz. relatively to its purity; and relatively to the proportion of the &s;ub&s;tances which compo&s;e it.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the fluid of the nerves is not equally pure in every individu|al. Notwith&s;tanding the extreme delicacy of the fibres, through which it is &s;epa|rated, it mixes with foreign matter extreme|ly &s;ubtil, but of a different nature, and only adapted to render it le&s;s pure and le&s;s active.</P>
<P>If you examine a body after the taking of a &s;trong narcotic, you will ob&s;erve the pul&s;e become weak, the re&s;piration diffi|cult, the head heavy, the &s;en&s;es dull, and all the organs in a &s;tupor. The&s;e different effects mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned by &s;ome &s;ulphu|rous principle, which exhales from nar|cotics, and corrupts the nervous fluid at its &s;ource.</P>
<P>That &s;ulphurous particles exhale from narcotics, is evident from divers experi|ments. Their vapours have the &s;ame
<PB N="114" REF="122">&s;cent, with the vapour of &s;ulphur: acids prevent their ill effects, as it does tho&s;e of all &s;ulphurous &s;ub&s;tances. The action of fire deprives them of their qualities; and applied externally to the head, or &s;oles of the feet, they produce the &s;ame effect as when taken inwardly.</P>
<P>Here we &s;ee that the purity of the ner|vous fluid is de&s;troyed; and the&s;e effects of narcotics are al&s;o produced by many other medicaments. The in&s;orption of the pus, in &s;uppurated wounds, by which the ner|vous fluid is depraved, occa&s;ions an op|pre&s;&s;ion of the &s;pirits. The vapours which exhale from gold or &s;ilver mines, and the e&s;&s;iuvia of infected air, produce the &s;ame effects.</P>
<P>This is the rea&s;on why formerly all animals langui&s;hed, that approached the <HI>lacus averni.</HI> They who dwelt near it were weak and di&s;|ea&s;ed, and their complexion pale and livid. The bea&s;ts gradually lo&s;t the u&s;e of their limbs, and putrification pre&s;ently en&s;ued. The birds no &s;ooner approached this infected atmo&s;phere, than they &s;eemed to have lo&s;t the power of flying. The moment they felt the effects of the&s;e de&s;tructive exha|lations, their wings lo&s;t their ela&s;ticity;
<PB N="115" REF="123">their bodies, their &s;trength; and they fell dead into the waters.</P>
<P>Not only external bodies deprave the fluid of the nerves; but the fluid, if ever &s;o pure, becomes vitiated, when it conti|nues in the body a con&s;iderable time with|out motion.</P>
<P>This is evident in continent per&s;ons, from the &s;tupor which is occa&s;ioned by corrupted &s;emen. When the te&s;ticles of a bull have been compre&s;&s;ed, and the &s;e|minal ve&s;&s;els rendered incapable of per|forming their functions, the parts adja|cent to the matrix of the cow are covered with ulcers and carno&s;ities, from the di&s;|charge of corrupted &s;emen in coition. From the&s;e ob&s;ervations, let us lay down this general rule.</P>
<P>The purer the nervous fluid is, the bet|ter it is adapted to the motion of the body, and the greater is the organic ela&s;ticity of the fibres.</P>
<P>The nervous fluid is a compound, form|ed of an extreme &s;ubtil &s;pirituous liquor, which is the principle of motion, and a gelatinous lymph which is likewi&s;e ex|tremely &s;ubtil, and &s;erves as a vehicle to
<PB N="116" REF="124">the animal &s;pirits, to &s;ix them and regu|late their action.</P>
<P>The nervous lymph has a much greater &s;hare in the compo&s;ition of this fluid, than the animal &s;pirits, but not always in the &s;ame proportion, nor has it always the &s;ame con&s;i&s;tence, nor the &s;ame fluidity.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider but for a moment the functions of the animal &s;pirits and nervous lymph, we &s;hall ea&s;ily perceive, that the fluid of the nerves mu&s;t produce very different effects, according to the different combination of the&s;e liquors.</P>
<P>If the animal &s;pirits be &s;upplied to the nervous fluid in too &s;mall a quantity, the organic ela&s;ticity of the fibres will be ex|tremely weak; if in too large a quantity, they irritate the &s;en&s;ibility of the&s;e organs by their pungency, as &s;typtics, when they are applied to excoriated parts of the body, render them rigid. The fluid of the nerves therefore does not give our fibres all their ela&s;ticity, except when it is combined with the nervous lymph in a ju&s;t pro|portion. Hence let us conclude, that the more fluid the nervous lymph is, the more in&s;tantaneous the action of the &s;ame fluid will be.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="125">The more this lymph abounds in the nervous fluid, the weaker and more lan|guid is the tone of the fibres. On the contrary, the greater the quantity of the animal &s;pirits, provided that quantity be not &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to occa&s;ion rigidity, the more powerful is its action, and the &s;tronger the ela&s;ticity of the fibres.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now examine the organic ela&s;ti|city relatively to the quantity of the ner|vous fluid, its quality being the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As our fibres are hollow cylinders, form|ed of planes of parallel <HI>fibrillae,</HI> let us view the phenomena which re&s;ult from their &s;tructure, relatively to the quantity of the fluid which pervades them. When exhau&s;ted of their fluid, the fibres are then relaxed, and entirely de&s;titute of organic ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of being entirely exhau&s;ted, &s;uppo&s;e, in the&s;e &s;ame fibres, a &s;mall quantity of nervous fluid, they will not be then &s;o much relaxed, and will po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome &s;mall degree of organic ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>But if the fibres abound with their fluid, and that not in too great a degree, they will yield to the impre&s;&s;ion of objects, their
<PB N="118" REF="126">re-action will be &s;trong, and they will have their full organic ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>However, to attain that end, the quan|tity of the fluid which pervades their fi|brillae, and that which pervades the tubes they compo&s;e, mu&s;t be proportinate.</P>
<P>When this fluid is in too great, or too &s;mall a quantity in the tubes, it com|pre&s;&s;es too powerfully, or too weakly the fluid contained in the fibrillae. In this ca&s;e the coats of the fibrillae are ill &s;up|ported; in the other ca&s;e they are rigid, and in both, the organic ela&s;ticity is very imperfect, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e fibrillae di&s;|tended to exce&s;s by their fluid, they will then oppo&s;e a very great re&s;i&s;tance to the action of any power; their re-action will be weak and difficult; in a word, they will be in a manife&s;t &s;tate of rigidity.</P>
<P>We may therefore conclude, that there are almo&s;t infinite degrees of organic ela&s;|ticity, whereof relaxation and rigidity are the extremes, and the mo&s;t perfect tone the middle term.</P>
<P>The original ela&s;ticity of the fibres va|ries likewi&s;e with the different &s;olidity of their coats.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="127">When too lax or too thin, their coats yield too ea&s;ily to the action of the ner|vous fluid, and re-act but with little force.</P>
<P>When too &s;olid, they difficulty yield to the action of that fluid, and re-act like|wi&s;e but weakly. The medium, or a mo|derate degree of &s;olidity, is therefore be&s;t adapted to communicate the due tone to our organs.</P>

<HEAD>The Organs of <HI>SENSE,</HI> con&s;idered with re|gard to their different Degrees of Sen&s;ibility.</HEAD>
<P>I &s;hall here &s;ubjoin &s;ome ob&s;ervations, on the organs of &s;en&s;e; and fir&s;t let us endeavour to di&s;cover upon what princi|ples the force of our &s;en&s;ations depends; and &s;ince we cannot e&s;timate the different degrees of the &s;en&s;ibility of our organs by intuition, let us deduce &s;ome rules from comparative anatomy, whereby we may be enabled to form a judgment of them. The&s;e rules mu&s;t be drawn from the nerves. As the&s;e organs have &s;o con&s;ide|rable a &s;hare in the phenomena of human nature, we cannot examine them too clo&s;e|ly, in order to become perfectly acquaint|ed with their &s;tructure.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="128">The nerves are the productions of the meninges with which they unite, and form one &s;ub&s;tance. On examining the &s;tructure of the nerves by the nice&s;t di&s;|&s;ections, we ob&s;erve that the meninges are formed of two lamellae, and that each of the&s;e lamellae has a duplicature, and its particular ve&s;&s;els, which never appear but when the&s;e membranes are inflamed.</P>
<P>The lamellae of the <HI>dura mater</HI> &s;upply the nerves with two thick and &s;olid coats; the lamellae of the <HI>pia mater</HI> &s;upply them with two coats likewi&s;e, but of a thinner &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>If we attentively trace the nerves from their origin, we may ob&s;erve, that they always dive&s;t them&s;elves of the mem|branes which they receive from the <HI>dura mater,</HI> when they form any organ of &s;en|&s;ation, where exqui&s;itene&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary; and even &s;ometimes they dive&s;t them&s;elves of the external lamella of the <HI>pia mater,</HI> when that organ requires a &s;uperior de|gree of &s;en&s;ibility: this is very evident in the &s;tructure of the eye.</P>
<P>The lamellae of the <HI>dura mater</HI> cover the lamellae of the <HI>pia mater.</HI> The lamel|lae of the&s;e membranes are united by a cel|lular
<PB N="121" REF="129">web; the interior lamellae form a reticular film, who&s;e cells are replete with the nervous fluid.</P>
<P>When the nerve dive&s;ts it&s;elf of its ex|terior coats, to form any organ of &s;en&s;a|tion, this cellular web, which I have ju&s;t mentioned, being no longer con&s;trained, dilates, and vegetates like the tendrils of the vine. The extremities of the&s;e ner|vous ramifications are extremely minute, and regularly bound together after the manner of a powder puff: &s;ometimes their many nervous fibrillae being uniform|ly united, form a contexture which much re&s;embles velvet.</P>
<P>Thus the nerves, being but little &s;en&s;i|ble in their large branches, and yet le&s;s in their trunks, become more &s;o in propor|tion as they are dive&s;ted of a greater num|ber of their coverings; for the &s;ub&s;tance of the parts which compo&s;e the organs of &s;melling, is more delicate and more &s;en&s;ible than that of the parts which form the organs of ta&s;te; the &s;ub&s;tance of the nervous parts which form the organ of &s;ight is more delicate, and more &s;en&s;ible than that of tho&s;e which compo&s;e the or|gan
<PB N="122" REF="130">of &s;melling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is evident, if we judge of it only by the &s;ubtilty of their re&s;pective objects: that of the &s;mell, is incomparably more delicate than that of the ta&s;te, and that of the &s;ight is infinitely &s;uperior to both.</NOTE>. It is therefore evi|dent, that the more &s;ub&s;tantial any nerve is, the more den&s;e is its &s;ub&s;tance, and the le&s;s &s;en&s;ible it will be.</P>
<P>But care mu&s;t be taken here, that we do not confound the appearance with the reality.</P>
<P>The whole nervous &s;ub&s;tance is indeed &s;en&s;ible, but how many are the cau&s;es which may render that &s;en&s;ibility of no ef|fect to the &s;oul? It is only by means of the nervous fluid, that the &s;oul is con&s;cious of the &s;en&s;iblity of the nerves, or rather, it is only by the aid of this fluid, that it re|ceives the impre&s;&s;ion of external objects on the organs of &s;en&s;e. Thus, that the &s;oul may perceive the &s;en&s;ibility of the nerves, if I may be allowed &s;o to expre&s;s my&s;elf, the&s;e organs mu&s;t be compo&s;ed of fibrillae, which are replete with the nervous fluid, and the &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e fibrillae mu&s;t be moved by the impre&s;&s;ion of objects in &s;uch a manner as to produce on the fluid they
<PB N="123" REF="131">contain, the motions nece&s;&s;ary to com|municate their &s;en&s;ations to the &s;oul. Hence a defect in the fluid of the nerves in the nervous fibrillae; when their re|ticular &s;ub&s;tance is too compact to admit this fluid, or too lax to retain it; when the coats of the organic fibres are too &s;olid to yield to the impre&s;&s;ion of objects, or too weak to re-act on their fluid; may be the cau&s;e, that an organical part &s;hall &s;eem to be entirely deprived of its &s;en&s;ibility. Hence the rea&s;on why the nervous film appears to be in&s;en&s;ible; the capillaments which compo&s;e this reticular &s;ub&s;tance, being no longer real ducts, but clo&s;ely compacted fibrillae, have no com|munication with the &s;oul. This is the rea&s;on why nervous fibres which are di&s;|po&s;ed to o&s;&s;ify, and tho&s;e which are ob|&s;tructed or covered, as it were, with a <HI>&s;tratum</HI> of fibres entirely &s;olid, appear to be void of all &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>If different cau&s;es may affect the &s;en&s;i|bility of the nerves, as it re&s;pects the &s;oul, &s;o as to render it of no effect; different cau&s;es may likewi&s;e modify it. Let us &s;till wave any enquiry into the reality of this, and
<PB N="124" REF="132">content our&s;elves with things as they ap|pear to our &s;en&s;es; and without fatiguing our&s;elves, by a fruitle&s;s endeavour to pry into the e&s;&s;ence of our &s;en&s;ations as they are in them&s;elves, and as they re&s;pect our organs, let us confine our&s;elves to con&s;i|der what they are with re&s;pect to the &s;oul, and to determine their different de|grees of energy from the &s;tructure of the organs of &s;en&s;e, and from the force of the impul&s;e communicated to their fluid.</P>
<P>The qualities of an organ, nece&s;&s;ary to the highe&s;t degree of &s;en&s;ibility, may be reduced to two points, viz. its &s;u&s;cepti|bility of being &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed by external objects, and that of forcibly communi|cating its impre&s;&s;ions to the nervous fluid. The highe&s;t &s;en&s;ibility of an organ de|pends then on the extreme minutene&s;s of its fibres, and on their very great ela&s;ticity: for the thinner the coats of the nervous fibres are, &s;o they be &s;trong enough to contain their fluid, the le&s;s they re&s;i&s;t the action of objects, and the &s;tronger are the impre&s;&s;ions they receive, <HI>caeteris paribus.</HI> This is the rea&s;on why nature is &s;o at|tentive to dive&s;t the nerves of their exterior
<PB N="125" REF="133">coats, when ever &s;he would form any deli|cate organ of &s;en&s;ation. Their &s;en&s;ibi|lity is then increa&s;ed in proportion to the minutene&s;s of the nervous fibrillae: and the more ela&s;tic they are, the better they will be adapted to communicate to the nervous fluid that impre&s;&s;ion which is re|qui&s;ite for tran&s;mitting to the &s;oul the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>This truth, which is founded on mecha|nical laws, is confirmed by experience. It is certain, that in &s;light inflammations, in ere&s;ipelatous efflore&s;cences and arthritic &s;wellings, the fibres are the mo&s;t ten&s;e, and the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible. It is likewi&s;e cer|tain, that the &s;oft fle&s;hy parts of the body, polypous excre&s;&s;ences, all fibres which are lax and greatly abounding with lymph, as the fibres of drop&s;ical per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;s a very &s;mall degree of &s;en&s;ibility, in compa|ri&s;on of the parts which are ten&s;e and not exce&s;&s;ively moi&s;tened. Another ob&s;erva|tion, which confirms the preceding, is that in the natural &s;tate of our fibres, when we would receive any exqui&s;ite &s;en|&s;ation, we di&s;tend the organ, as may be ob&s;erved in the eyes and ears of attentive
<PB N="126" REF="134">per&s;ons: the &s;en&s;ibility of our organs in|crea&s;ing with the ela&s;ticity of our fibres.</P>
<P>Let us conclude then, that <HI>the highe&s;t degree of &s;en&s;ibility depends on the extreme minutene&s;s and ela&s;ticity of the nervous fibres.</HI></P>
<P>By this method we may judge how the &s;en&s;ibility of one per&s;on differs from the &s;en&s;ibility of another, notwith&s;tanding &s;en|&s;ations are incommunicable.</P>

<P>If the body be an admirable machine, the &s;oul is a &s;ub&s;tance yet more wonderful. The body indeed exi&s;ts independent of the &s;oul, but it is the &s;oul which animates it.</P>
<P>This is that invi&s;ible agent which actuates the limbs, which produces that harmony of motion, and all tho&s;e rapid and &s;urpri&s;ing movements we di&s;cover in the body. It is the &s;oul which varies the phy&s;iognomy,
<PB N="128" REF="136">and by turns impre&s;&s;es thereon grace, ma|je&s;ty, fear, meekne&s;s, innocence, and love. It is this which renders the countenance the index of the mind, &s;o that we read thereon the thoughts which the tongue refu&s;es to reveal. Without the &s;oul, the body would be like a plant, &s;eparated from the &s;oil whence it drew its nouri&s;hment, and would peri&s;h as &s;oon as delivered from the womb, notwith&s;tanding its admirable &s;tructure, from its inability, to &s;elect the aliments, by which the decays of nature might be repaired. But however great this power of the &s;oul may appear, it is not confined to this.</P>
<P>The body is undoubtedly a &s;en&s;ible be|ing; but it is by the &s;oul only that we are enabled to judge of the union of both, and are con&s;cious of that intimate communica|tion, by which they are reciprocally &s;en&s;i|ble to the impre&s;&s;ions of each other, and are indeed two di&s;tinct beings united in one.</P>
<P>It is the &s;oul, which renders Man an in|telligent and free being, by its innate energy, di&s;&s;ipates the darkne&s;s in which nature had involved him, whereby he be|comes acquainted with other beings, his
<PB N="129" REF="137">fellow inhabitants of this earth, and &s;oar|ing above into the cele&s;tial regions, makes him comprehend all nature in his ideas; and is, in fine, the cau&s;e of that amazing knowledge and &s;agacity wherewith he is endowed.</P>
<P>It is the &s;oul which a&s;&s;embles all the be|ings in nature before him, and, calling back pa&s;t times, in &s;ome &s;ort extends his exi&s;tence throughout all ages; rai&s;es him above &s;en&s;ible objects; tran&s;ports him into the va&s;t fields of imagination; enlarges, &s;o to &s;peak, the boundaries of the univer&s;e; creates new worlds, and enhances his enjoy|ments by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of objects which never had a being.</P>
<P>In a word, the &s;oul, by its knowledge and pa&s;&s;ions, enables this weak imperfect creature, Man, to change the face of na|ture; and, at his will and plea&s;ure, to become either its tyrant or benefactor.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Faculties of the <HI>SOUL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>We have no immediate knowledge of the &s;oul; all we know of it is by its fa|culties, and the&s;e are known to us only by their effects.</P>
<P>Man can perceive objects which are not cognizable by the &s;en&s;es; he has therefore a <HI>&s;en&s;ibility</HI> di&s;tinct from that of the body.</P>
<P>He can compare his &s;en&s;ations, and de|termine their relations and difference; he has therefore a <HI>faculty of judging.</HI></P>

<P>The&s;e faculties of the &s;oul have been long known to philo&s;ophers; and they are the only ones which modern philo&s;ophy acknowledges. But if we attentively con&s;ider human actions, there evidently appears in the &s;oul another faculty, in|tirely different from the preceding, and is the &s;ame with that which in brute animals is called <HI>in&s;tinct:</HI> that is, a natural bias or pronene&s;s to particular objects, inde|pendent of, and prior to all knowledge.</P>
<P>It is this faculty which regulates the ac|tions of Man in the early parts of life; and &s;ometimes regulates them in his riper years, though without being perceived; for it is not owing to learning, nor to ex|perience that infants &s;uck the brea&s;t, ap|ply things to the mouth, or extend their hands to the objects which plea&s;e them; it is not rea&s;on which teaches them to fly from danger, or &s;hrink from fire, when they fir&s;t feel it burn them.</P>
<P>This principle is inherent in Man, though not always perceived. As it was given us to regulate our actions till &s;uch time as rea&s;on is &s;ufficiently unfolded, &s;o we find,
<PB N="132" REF="140">that in proportion as rea&s;on appears, in|&s;tinct gradually vani&s;hes: and in tho&s;e ac|tions which it afterwards directs, as we &s;eldom examine what pa&s;&s;es within us, we are unable to di&s;tingu&s;h &s;uch as are to be attributed to rea&s;on, from tho&s;e which proceed from in&s;tinct.</P>
<P>A kind of titillation felt in the bo|dy generates love in the &s;oul, but in|&s;tinct points out the object. This is what cau&s;es the mutual propen&s;ity of the &s;exes, and prompts them to perpe|tuate their &s;pecies. It is in&s;tinct which moves the mother to &s;uckle her infant, teaches the hen to cover her eggs, and the wolf to nouri&s;h her young. But if Man ever had occa&s;ion for this principle, if he ever &s;tood in need of its con&s;tant a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it mu&s;t have been in the fir&s;t days of crea|tion. Let us then view Man ju&s;t as he came out of the hands of Nature; and here we are not to have recour&s;e to mira|cles, neither are we to imagine our fir&s;t parents had any extraordinary means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; we are to &s;uppo&s;e the laws of nature acting, in the <HI>primordial</HI> &s;tate of things, as they act at pre&s;ent, &s;ee|ing there is no rea&s;on to believe that they
<PB N="133" REF="141">have varied; let us therefore endeavour to &s;upply, by philo&s;ophical inferences, the chronology of tho&s;e ages which are un|known.</P>
<P>Man, at his fir&s;t coming into the world, is feeble, helple&s;s, and entirely de|void of knowledge; he therefore needs &s;trength, a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and judgment: even his &s;en&s;es are not then developed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The eyes, indeed, di&s;cern the light, but indi&s;tinctly.

<P>The &s;en&s;es gradually unfold, and are perfected by exerci&s;e; by degrees an in|fant learns to &s;ee and feel; the faculties of the &s;oul, afterwards expand with tho&s;e of the body, and ri&s;e to perfection by ex|erci&s;e. What notion are we to form of Man's condition, during this long inter|val? In what manner are we to &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="134" REF="142">him to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, &s;ince we mu&s;t not have re|cour&s;e to cele&s;tial aid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have heard &s;ome philo&s;ophers, more re&s;pectable for their piety than judgment, who &s;uppo&s;ed, our fir&s;t parents had very &s;trange modes of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. Some pretended that they were fed by angels; others, that they were &s;uckled by &s;heep; and others again, that they were endowed with intuitive knowledge.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing Man's condition, at the in|&s;tant of his creation, in all re&s;pects like that of a new born infant, and that nature, in the unfolding of his or|gans, pur&s;ued the &s;ame laws as at pre&s;ent, he mu&s;t evidently have died of hunger, long before he could even be capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing his proper nouri&s;hment. The human race therefore mu&s;t have pe|ri&s;hed, had Man's original condition been a &s;tate of infancy: hence nature mu&s;t have be&s;towed on Man at fir&s;t all we want at our birth, with whatever is requi&s;ite for animal &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. The evidence of facts obliges us to believe, that Man came from the hands of the Creator, of full &s;tature and &s;trength, with all the &s;en&s;es in perfection, as Pallas is &s;aid to have &s;prung the head of Jupiter.</P>
<P>Thus, although it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that Man mu&s;t have been created of full vi|gour,
<PB N="105" REF="143">with all his &s;en&s;es perfect, we have yet advanced but very little: it remains to &s;hew in what manner he was afterwards to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. It was not &s;ufficient to &s;uppo&s;e him endowed with bodily &s;trength, that he knew how to avail him&s;elf of the in|formation of his &s;en&s;es, and of the activi|ty of his limbs; he mu&s;t likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s the faculty of di&s;tingui&s;hing his aliments; for, without this, all the re&s;t of his en|dowments would have been u&s;ele&s;s. It may ea&s;ily be conceived, in what manner Man, in proce&s;s of time, could be enabled to acquire this knowledge; and it is evi|dent, that this was not the fir&s;t knowledge he did acquire.</P>
<P>When hungry or thir&s;ty, how came he to know that eating and drinking would &s;atisfy the&s;e cravings? Let tho&s;e who pretend to deduce every thing from rea&s;on and experience, &s;olve this problem. Confine Man's &s;aculties to &s;imple rea&s;on, and leave him to be in&s;tructed by flow ex|perience, his whole life will be &s;pent before he can attain the knowledge of his ali|ments; &s;o that he might die of hunger at the &s;oot of a tree loaden with fruit,
<PB N="136" REF="144">of thir&s;t on the bank of a river; or, from his ignorance of the nature of co|medible &s;ub&s;tances, eat poi&s;on. What then mu&s;t have become of Man, had he been without in&s;tinct, his only infallible guide. Who does not &s;ee that, with this boa&s;ted rea&s;on, the human race had peri&s;hed, notwith&s;tanding all the precau|tions of nature for their pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Some think to elude the nece&s;&s;ity of in|&s;tinct to Man, by alledging, that he imi|tated the bea&s;ts; but this is only &s;hun|ning the difficulty, not &s;olving it.</P>
<P>Taking it for granted that Man imitat|ed the bea&s;ts, it is evident, that this pro|pen&s;ity to imitation, mu&s;t have been in|nate and prior to all knowledge: but how came Man by this propen&s;ity to imitate them? Be&s;ides, doth not this imitation &s;uppo&s;e in Man a knowledge he could not have as yet acquired; a knowledge of the phy&s;ical relation, between his nature and that of bea&s;ts? How many difficulties &s;tand in the way of this hypothe&s;is! And what a concurrence of circum|&s;tances mu&s;t be imagined! We mu&s;t fir&s;t prove, that Man was endowed with ca|pacity to ob&s;erve the brute animals; and
<PB N="137" REF="145">then &s;hew how he came to confine his imi|tation of them to certain particular ca&s;es; as for in&s;tance, why he imitated the goat, on|ly when it brou&s;ed on the tendrils of the vine, and not when it cropped the hem|lock; for otherwi&s;e he would have found a poi&s;on where he &s;ought for food.</P>
<P>Hence it is evident, that by attributing to Man an in&s;tinct, whereby he &s;upported him&s;elf in imitation of the in&s;tinct of brute animals, and admitting him to have imitated them in tho&s;e ca&s;es only which are conformable to his nature, we attribute to him a guide different from rea&s;on. It were more eligible to allow him an in&s;tinct, by which he is enabled of him&s;elf to di&s;cern his proper nouri&s;hment; in&s;tead of allow|ing him any faculty which is &s;till re&s;olvable into in&s;tinct, though of another kind, and &s;erves only to multiply difficulties unavoid|able on &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on then could not be a &s;ufficient guide to Man; we mu&s;t therefore allow him to po&s;&s;e&s;s an in&s;tinct, as an additional men|tal faculty whereby he is directed, like other animals, in the choice of his proper aliments.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> INNATE SENTIMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e faculties, there is in the &s;oul an innate &s;entiment, <HI>prior to all &s;en&s;a|tion,</HI> and to all ideas with which nature has connected the pre&s;ervation of human beings; I mean &s;elf-love, that powerful principle, which irre&s;i&s;tibly directs man|kind in all their actions, often without being perceived, the &s;ource of every pa&s;|&s;ion, and the end to which all our de&s;ires are directed.</P>
<P>As this love is unbounded, and infinite|ly more &s;trong than the love of others, &s;imple as it is, it has been divided into two &s;entiments, different in their nature and effects, viz. love of our&s;elves, and love of preference: but it is ea&s;ily per|ceived, that the&s;e are but one and the &s;ame affection of the &s;oul, which is only di&s;tingui&s;hable by circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>When the love of our&s;elves acts &s;imply in Man, without his comparing him&s;elf with others, it is a &s;entiment prompting him to &s;eek after happine&s;s or plea&s;ure, and to fly from pain.</P>
<P>When it acts in oppo&s;ition to the ad|vantage of others, it induces Man to pre|fer
<PB N="139" REF="147">him&s;elf to every other con&s;ideration, and to pur&s;ue his own good, even to the prejudice of his friend. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the love of &s;elf, prompting us ince&s;&s;antly to pur&s;ue happine&s;s, becomes the &s;ource of a va&s;t number of plea&s;ing &s;entiments, with regard to the objects of our plea&s;ure. In the &s;econd, the love of &s;elf annihilates every other &s;entiment, and changes its na|ture. It is this which turns fraternal af|fection into hatred, arms rival brothers for their reciprocal de&s;truction, and in&s;tigates them to mutual murders on the ruins of a father's throne. It is this which, among &s;avage nations, in&s;tils fury into the brea&s;t of warriors, &s;teels the victor's bo&s;om again&s;t his vanqui&s;hed foe, &s;o as even to make him devour the entrails of the &s;lain yet palpitat|ing with life. It is this which, in a city be|&s;et by an enemy without, and pre&s;&s;ed by famine within, transforms the tender na|ture of females to &s;avage fury, and makes the mother de&s;troy the fruit of her womb. It is this, in a word, which in&s;pires all tho&s;e cruel deeds, all tho&s;e &s;anguinary actions, which nature recoils to hear mentioned.</P>
<P>Another &s;entiment innate in the human heart, and which is felt only at intervals,
<PB N="140" REF="148">is maternal affection, that indearing pro|pen&s;ity, on which the pre&s;ervation of our &s;pecies during infancy depends.</P>
<P>This &s;entiment is independent of every other, and is as blind and undi&s;cerning in its manner of acting as in&s;tinct it&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We frequently ob&s;erve hens to hatch and feed young ducklings, and ducks to hatch and feed chickens.</NOTE>.

Be&s;ides, in how many other in&s;tances doth this affection appear? Con|&s;traint, di&s;agreeable offices, every kind of &s;elf-denial, become plea&s;ing ta&s;ks to a mo|ther, and trouble&s;ome though they be, yet &s;he con&s;tantly di&s;charges them at the ex|pence of her plea&s;ure, re&s;t, and often of life it&s;elf:&mdash;how many dangers do &s;ome mothers voluntarily undergo for the pre|&s;ervation of their offspring!</P>
<P>It is no le&s;s ab&s;urd, to deduce this af|fection from friend&s;hip. On what ideas of the merit of a new born infant, incapa|ble of communicating any plea&s;ure, and

<HEAD>A Refutation of the Opinion of Philo&s;ophers concerning <HI>PITY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Some philo&s;ophers to the number of in|nate &s;entiments already mentioned add pity&mdash;that gentle emotion which mode|rates the love of &s;elf; intere&s;ts the happy in the &s;ufferings of their fellow creatures, and by the bond of philanthropy unites all human kind.</P>

<P><Q>At the &s;ight of a ravenous bea&s;t, tearing the tender body of an infant, we feel extreme angui&s;h, and the &s;oul un|dergoes excruciating agitations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Pity is &s;o natural a &s;entiment, that it precedes reflection, and even brute ani|mals have evident marks of it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="150"><Q>A hor&s;e &s;tarts back at the &s;ight of a dead one, one dog licks the wounds of another, and cattle, when driven to the &s;laughter-hou&s;e, vent doleful cries.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are the proofs whereon tho&s;e philo&s;ophers ground their opinion.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t &s;ight it appears to be well found|ed, but it is ea&s;y to conceive, that nature formed not Man originally compa&s;&s;ionate. All men have not pity, &s;avages but little, children le&s;s, and Man, who, if this opinion were true, ought to give the mo&s;t evident proofs of it, in the early part of life, betrays not the lea&s;t &s;ign of any &s;uch &s;entiment.</P>
<P>If pity is an innate &s;entiment, why the human heart is void of it in infancy? Why, in tho&s;e who are in&s;ane from their birth, &s;hould this principle be likewi&s;e wholly imperceptible, &s;eeing they are not deprived of the other faculties of the &s;oul?</P>
<P><Q>Pity is a &s;entiment &s;o natural, that the brute creation have many works of it.</Q></P>
<P>What foundation is there for this a&s;&s;er|tion?</P>
<P><Q>A hor&s;e &s;tarts back at the &s;ight of a dead one; one dog licks the wounds of another; and cattle, when driven to the place of &s;laughter, vent doleful cries.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="151">But who is a&s;&s;ured that this is not an in&s;tinct peculiar to brutes? Who knows, whether the&s;e external &s;igns be not the effect of &s;ome di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, or rather, of fear excited by the horror of the &s;ight, than marks of compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Even in Man, the external marks of pity are not pity it&s;elf; we may have the &s;tronge&s;t appearance of being affected, and not feel the lea&s;t emotion. A per&s;on may zealou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;t in dre&s;&s;ing another's wounds, ea&s;ing his aching limbs, and al|leviating his misfortunes, merely from the hope of being relieved in his turn; ano|ther, from a motive of being upon good terms with heaven; and a third, wholly from the plea&s;ure attendant on the exer|ci&s;e of virtue.</P>
<P>He alone who, on &s;eeing the &s;ufferings of the unfortunate, compa&s;&s;ionates their lot, is a compa&s;&s;ionate man. Now with a little reflection we may perceive, that pity is an artificial &s;entiment, acquired in &s;ociety; it is founded on the idea of pain, and the relations in which Man &s;tands with re&s;pect to &s;en&s;ible beings. For, to pity the mi&s;eries of others, he mu&s;t fir&s;t have an idea of them; he that has never &s;uf|fered,
<PB N="144" REF="152">nor has any idea of pain, is un|moved at the tears, complaints, the long and vehement cries of the &s;orrowful heart; the &s;ight of the &s;ufferings of others does not affect him; their wounds appear di&s;|gu&s;tful; he &s;huns the &s;ight of them, and keeps aloof, but never commi&s;erates them.</P>
<P><Q>To pity, we mu&s;t be acquainted with the &s;ufferings of our fellow-creatures, but not feel them. When we know by experience what pain is, we pity tho&s;e who &s;uffer; but when we our&s;elves are in pain, we then feel only what we our&s;elves undergo. In every &s;tation &s;ubject to the calamities of life, we allow to others that &s;hare of our &s;en|&s;ibility only which we have no occa&s;ion for our&s;elves.</Q> Pity is therefore evi|dently no more than our own &s;en&s;ibility, directed by an act of the mind towards tho&s;e with whom we &s;ympathize. Thus pity and &s;elf love are always in an inver&s;e proportion.</P>
<P>They who, from an exce&s;s of delicacy, and a continual habit of indulging them|&s;elves in every &s;ort of plea&s;ure, are not affected by the &s;ufferings of others; their
<PB N="145" REF="153">&s;en&s;ibility is con&s;tantly employed on them|&s;elves; they are altogether unconcerned about all beings be&s;ides, and their hearts are &s;teeled again&s;t the &s;ufferings of man|kind. In proportion as this love of &s;elf increa&s;es, pity decays, and frequently be|comes extinct.</P>
<P>He who now melts into tears at the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of the unfortunate, was he his enemy, in&s;tead of alleviating, would ag|gravate his misfortunes.</P>
<P><HI>Nero,</HI> who wi&s;hed he had never learn|ed to write when pre&s;&s;ed to &s;ign the war|rant for a criminal's execution, could delight in the murder of his enemies. The tyrant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alexander, tyrant of Phares.</NOTE>, that loudly bewailed the fate of <HI>Hecuba</HI> and <HI>Andromache,</HI> as repre|&s;ented on the &s;tage, could hear without emotion the cries of tho&s;e he had doomed to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Pity is not only de&s;troyed by the pa&s;&s;ions; it is even generated in the heart only by prudent reflections, is nouri&s;hed only by tender &s;entiments, and is extingui&s;hed by the frequency of tho&s;e objects, which ought naturally to confirm it. Let us &s;up|po&s;e a man has never heard any one di&s;cour&s;e
<PB N="146" REF="154">on ideas of ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s, clemency and genero&s;ity: he mu&s;t remain for ever ignorant of the very names of tho&s;e vir|tues.

By often frequenting them, the &s;oul becomes callous to their impre&s;&s;ions; is unaffected with the pro&s;pect of human mi&s;eries, and in&s;en&s;ible to every tender emotion.</P>
<P>Does not the&s;e rea&s;ons prove, that pity is not a native of the human brea&s;t?</P>
<P>The different powers of the foul, may therefore be reduced to the&s;e following, viz. &s;en&s;ibility, in&s;tinct, under&s;tanding, memory, will, &s;elf-love, and maternal af|fection.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the mutual connex|ion and dependence of the&s;e different pow|ers, we readily perceive, that every pro|duction of genius, the effects of the pa&s;|&s;ions, and all the other wonderful pheno|mena

As an active principle, it per|ceives objects, compares, unites, and di&s;|joins them in a thou&s;and ways, judges or their relations: by the&s;e different com|binations it acquires the knowledge of things, unravels the &s;y&s;tem of the uni|ver&s;e, tran&s;ports us into futurity, recalls

<P>The under&s;tanding, though active by nature, has undoubtedly need of the &s;en|&s;ations to enable it to act, but operates of it&s;elf when it has received this a&s;&s;i&s;tance: it is the will which &s;elects the objects of its operations; but it is the under&s;tanding alone which perceives them, determines on their relations, and forms its judgment without our interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>There are two di&s;tinct powers in the under&s;tanding, which philo&s;ophers have ever confounded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The under&s;tanding operates with &s;o great activity in certain ca&s;es, and the judgments follow &s;o extremely clo&s;e in others, that they are ea&s;ily confounded.</NOTE>, viz. the power of per|ceiving, con&s;idering, and comparing ob|jects; and the power of judging of their relations.

<P>Even <HI>Helvetius,</HI> who has more minutely handled this &s;ubject, has too much con|fined the power of the imagination, by de|fining it the power of conceiving things in a figurative manner, and of rendering ideas by images. If it is the imagination which gives being to a &s;phynx, creates the gar|dens of He&s;perides, or the inchanted I&s;le of Armida: it is &s;till the &s;ame faculty which, with the help of atoms, lines, &s;ur|faces, and &s;olids, builds the worlds of <HI>Epicurus</HI> and <HI>Des Cartes.</HI> It is the ima|gination which collects the different events of human life in romance, combines them, forms intrigues, like tho&s;e which the pa&s;|&s;ions are capable of producing, and gives them the air of true hi&s;tory, though they are only the work of genius and &s;en&s;ibi|lity. It is imagination that launches into futurity, prevents the rapid flight of time, tran&s;ports us beyond the grave, re&s;tores

<P>The peculiar characteri&s;tic of the ima|gination is invention; I have &s;aid, that its productions are not formed upon any model in nature; &s;uch a model may indeed exi&s;t, but mu&s;t not be known, otherwi&s;e it is no longer invention, and all is reduced to mere narration: the picture then becomes a copy; the romance, a hi&s;tory; and imagination, rea&s;on.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> FORMATION <HI>of our</HI> IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>We di&s;tingui&s;h objects by their re&s;pec|tive &s;en&s;ations. On comparing the&s;e dif|ferent objects, we find in them &s;ome com|mon properties, and &s;ome that are peculiar to each object. The knowledge of the properties and relations common to differ|ent individuals, are called <HI>ideas.</HI></P>
<P>Of this &s;ort are the ideas of exten&s;ion, impenetrability, gravity; properties com|mon to all matter: as al&s;o that of a trian|gle, taken from the meeting of three right lines at their extremities.</P>
<P>The more con&s;iderable the number of &s;ingle objects, who&s;e properties are common
<PB N="153" REF="161">is, the more exten&s;ive is the idea: the idea of body, for in&s;tance, is much more exten&s;ive than the idea of metal.</P>
<P>Although every idea is a particular one, yet there is no &s;imple idea of any &s;ingle object, much le&s;s of &s;pecies or kind; becau&s;e every idea is compo&s;ed of tho&s;e properties which objects, when compared, have in com|mon: now every individual object, every &s;pecies, and every kind, be&s;ides tho&s;e common properties, have &s;everal which are peculiar. What metaphy&s;icians have given for &s;imple ideas, and even Locke him|&s;elf, is only a compound of ab&s;tract ideas. We may ea&s;ily be a&s;&s;ured of this, by ana|ly&s;ing their definitions; how great &s;o ever the number of ideas which enter into the ma&s;s may be, you will oftentimes find that number too &s;mall, to define the object who&s;e idea they are intended to convey; as in the ideas of Man, animal, virtue, plant, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Hence ari&s;e tho&s;e eternal di&s;putes, to which almo&s;t every metaphy&s;ical enquiry is liable, and to which they have &s;o fre|quently given ri&s;e. Hence the many ab|&s;urd conclu&s;ions which flow from the &s;y&s;|tems of philo&s;ophers; examine their defi|nitions, and you will find the idea of a vir|tuous
<PB N="154" REF="162">man, according to <HI>Socrates,</HI> very different from that of a virtuous man, ac|cording to <HI>Diogenes;</HI> and the idea of Man in <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> is by no means the &s;ame with the idea of Man in <HI>Plato.</HI> What &s;eems to have led metaphy&s;icians into this error was, that, as the &s;everal properties of bo|dies appear always combined in the &s;ame &s;ubject and always the &s;ame, they inferred, that they mu&s;t all appertain to the &s;ame &s;ubject, and when they affixed a name to that &s;ubject, they con&s;idered the a&s;&s;em|blage of the&s;e qualities, not as a com|pound idea, as it really is, but as a &s;im|ple uncompounded idea.</P>
<P>Although every idea may be equally ab&s;tract, all are not of the &s;ame nature. Some, which are formed from the rela|tions of corporeal beings compared toge|ther, have only material properties for their objects; &s;uch are the ideas of exten|&s;ion, burning, hardne&s;s, motion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Others, which are formed from the re|lations of &s;en&s;itive, active, and intelligent beings, compared together, have only in|tellectual properties for their objects; of this &s;ort are the ideas of goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice, beauty, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> MEMORY.</HEAD>
<P>How many different words! How many adventures! How many volumes are contained in Man's memory! How many languages! What a field of hi&s;tory and chronology! But what is the nature of memory, this va&s;t receptacle of &s;o ma|ny &s;en&s;ations, and &s;o many ideas; where
<PB N="156" REF="164">&s;o many acquirements are depo&s;ited, where events, &s;wallowed up by time and never to return, are pre&s;erved from the eternal night of oblivion; where times which are no more, enjoy a kind of perpetuity? A new prodigy this! as admirable as the under&s;tanding it&s;elf, and concerning who&s;e nature and origin we are equally in the dark.</P>
<P>Memory is grounded on the &s;en&s;ations and ideas, but is entirely different both from &s;en&s;ibility and from the intellect. With|out &s;en&s;ibility, there can be no &s;en&s;ations; without the intellect, there can be no ideas: but when the &s;en&s;ations are once received, and the ideas formed, the &s;oul no longer requires the aid of the&s;e facul|ties to retain them. Hence memory is a particular faculty; and is the power of pre&s;erving the impre&s;&s;ions and ideas of objects which have affected us; in a word, it is the mirror<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some &s;uperficial philo&s;ophers, always ready to ex|plain what they do not under&s;tand, having ob&s;erved, that the memory much depends on the organization, have con|cluded that this faculty is wholly mechanical. <Q>Some accidents, &s;ay they, which happen to the body only, weaken and de&s;troy the memory; it therefore re|&s;ides in the organs of the body.</Q> But how is it po&s;|&s;ible in &s;o intimate an union, as that of the &s;oul and body, for an accident to affect the one without affecting the other at the &s;ame time? How is it po&s;&s;ible to con|ceive this accident as acting &s;eparately on the one only? Be&s;ides, the &s;ame cau&s;es which de&s;troy the memory, likewi&s;e de&s;troy rea&s;on; are we therefore to conclude, that the judgment is an organic faculty? That phy&s;ical cau&s;es oppre&s;s, or prevent the exerci&s;e of our faculties in whole or in part, is the true con&s;equence to be de|duced from the&s;e ob&s;ervations. What then can be more ab&s;urd; than to &s;uppo&s;e the memory a corporeal faculty?
<P>They who maintain this ab&s;urdity, bring many argu|ments equally ab&s;urd to &s;upport it. They &s;ay, <Q>The &s;en&s;ations are vibrations of the nervous fibres produced by external objects, and the memory is the receptacle of all the&s;e vibrations.</Q> But in what manner could they explain, by the help of this, the wonderful phe|nomena of the memory? Were it true, that the &s;en&s;a|tions are produced by the vibrations of the organ af|fected; it is fal&s;e, that they are communicated to the &s;oul in the &s;ame manner: but &s;uppo&s;e this to be true likewi&s;e, what will they gain by this?</P>
<P>The remembrance of &s;en&s;ation is continued for a long time; the vibrations which cau&s;e them, according to this hypothe&s;is, la&s;t only a few moments, even in the mo&s;t ela&s;tic chord; how then is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive that they &s;hould endure for a long &s;eries of years in the fibres of our organs, not near &s;o ela&s;tic, and al&s;o in the fibres of the brain, which are incomparably le&s;s &s;o? Thus, by &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;en&s;ations to be produced by the different vibrations, when the fibres cea&s;e their tremor, the vibrations in&s;tantly cea&s;e: what &s;en&s;ations then can remain in the memory, be&s;ides tho&s;e with which the organs are actually affected? Our philo&s;o|phers, when called upon to explain how this long du|ration of &s;en&s;ations is to be accounted for according to their &s;y&s;tem, gravely an&s;wer: <Q>The&s;e vibrations of the nervous fibres in the brain produce a kind of du|rable impre&s;&s;ion, whereby the &s;en&s;ations and ideas are &s;ixed in &s;uch manner, that an intellectual Being, per|fectly acquainted with the organization of the brain, and capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing, in a very accurate man|ner, every impre&s;&s;ion in it, might read their characters as in a book; that this prodigious number of ex|tremely minute organs, appropriated to &s;entiment and to thought, would be to &s;uch a Being what printers types are to us.</Q> What a pretty conceit this of impre&s;&s;ions on the brain! Where did the&s;e &s;ages &s;ee the impre&s;&s;ion? On what foundation do they build &s;o &s;trange an hypothe&s;is? They tell us, it is by an impre&s;&s;ion the&s;e &s;en&s;ations are pre&s;erved; but what they take no notice of, although it is of the utmo&s;t con|&s;equence to be explained, is in what manner the&s;e &s;im|ple vibrations are thus impre&s;&s;ed. But why talk of vi|brations? It is the nervous fluid which carries the im|pre&s;&s;ions to the &s;oul. Suppo&s;ing this &s;luid could thus imprint characters on the brain, how can it produce a durable impre&s;&s;ion on &s;o &s;oft a &s;ub&s;tance?</P>
<P>But to &s;ay no more about all the&s;e ab&s;urdities, there will &s;till remain, in their &s;y&s;tem, a number more than &s;ufficient to demon&s;trate them to be gro&s;sly mi&s;taken. By the&s;e vibrations and impre&s;&s;ions they believe the re|tention of our &s;en&s;ations accounted for: but how do they account for that of the ideas? There is certainly no vibration, nor any fibre; how then is this impre&s;&s;ion produced? Be&s;ides, by making the memory a purely orga|nic faculty, the objects of which are the impre&s;&s;ions and characters engraved on the brain, we can never con|ceive the reproduction of the &s;en&s;ations of the mind, as independent of the reiterated action of the&s;e objects on the &s;en&s;es, that is to &s;ay, without the pre&s;ence of the objects which produced them.</P>
<P>It frequently happens from di&s;ea&s;es, that we forget almo&s;t every thing, and that recollection returns after|wards by &s;low degrees. If then the characters and im|pre&s;&s;ions which pre&s;erve the image of objects in the &s;oul be of this nature, when they are once defaced, there is an end of all the &s;en&s;ations depo&s;ited in the memory, and this faculty can no longer exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Let us conclude, that the memory is a faculty purely &s;piritual, like the judgment and will.</P></NOTE> of pa&s;t &s;en&s;ations, ideas, and &s;entiments, as &s;en&s;ibility is the mir|ror

<PB N="161" REF="169">con&s;ider the mutual connexion of our faculties, we ea&s;ily perceive, that re|membrance and recollection are only ef|fects of our different intellectual powers, reciprocally combined.</P>
<P>When the &s;oul is affected with &s;en&s;a|tions and ideas; the retention of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations and ideas I call <HI>memory.</HI></P>

<P>We can a&s;&s;emble at plea&s;ure a &s;eries of pa&s;t ideas and &s;en&s;ations; this faculty I &s;hall term <HI>recollection.</HI></P>
<P>Memory is a faculty purely pa&s;&s;ive like &s;en&s;ibility; but the remembering of par|ticular &s;en&s;ations or particular ideas, is not &s;imply the perceiving our &s;en&s;ations pre|&s;ent and pa&s;t, but the knowing the &s;en|&s;ation or idea, which we actually experi|ence, to be the &s;ame we experienced be|fore.</P>
<P>The memory is the power of retaining pa&s;t impre&s;&s;ions. Sen&s;ibility that of per|ceiving tho&s;e which are pre&s;ent to us: one is the &s;torehou&s;e of things pa&s;t; the
<PB N="162" REF="170">other, of things pre&s;ent: but it is in the under&s;tanding alone that the power re&s;ides, of perceiving in the&s;e &s;torehou&s;es, things pa&s;t and pre&s;ent, of con&s;idering and com|paring them, and determining, whether their impre&s;&s;ions are altogether new, or only reproduced; in a word, the under|&s;tanding alone is con&s;cious of their iden|tity. Hence we perceive that remem|brance is not a &s;imple faculty, but is compounded of memory, &s;en&s;ibility and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>In recollection likewi&s;e, it is not the memory that retraces pa&s;t &s;en&s;ations and pa&s;t ideas in our minds: if we attend ever &s;o little to what is pa&s;&s;ing within us during the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our thoughts, we may be convinced, that it is the under&s;tanding alone, as being continually actuated with &s;ome &s;en&s;ation, or idea, which pa&s;&s;es from tho&s;e with which it is actually affected, to analogous &s;en&s;ations, and to ideas which have formerly affected it, and which thus recalls pa&s;t things to the mind by means of analogy. Thus, when we chu&s;e to recollect any &s;en&s;ations or ideas, we per|ceive them ready to pre&s;ent them&s;elves,
<PB N="163" REF="171">as &s;oon as the mind runs over the neare&s;t analogies.</P>
<P>If this power of rendering pre&s;ent to the mind, the &s;en&s;ations and ideas trea&s;ured up in the memory, &s;ometimes act without our interpo&s;ition, it is al&s;o &s;ometimes &s;ubject to the will. Recollection is not therefore a &s;imple faculty, but the aggregate of many faculties united. In remembrance, memory is combined with the under&s;tand|ing, and pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ations; in recollection it is combined with the under&s;tanding and the will, but without the&s;e &s;en&s;ations. It is thus that the&s;e different faculties jointly produce remembrance and recol|lection.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>WILL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It remains, that we enquire into the nature of the will; a &s;ingular faculty, which is &s;ometimes directed by the under|&s;tanding, but is always governed by &s;entiment; has a &s;trong propen&s;ity to plea&s;ure, and abhorrence of pain; and, from that mixture of good and evil, which the under&s;tanding pre&s;ents to it, choo&s;es the one, rejects the other, and with an ab&s;olute authority determines
<PB N="164" REF="172">Man towards action or re&s;t. We are ac|quainted with the nature of the will only by our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its exi&s;tence and effects; notwith&s;tanding all our efforts to dive farther into its nature, and let our &s;agacity be ever &s;o great, our endeavour, will &s;erve only to involve us in darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The will, con&s;idered in its effects, is a faculty &s;ometimes active, and &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ive. Active, when it impels man to action; pa&s;&s;ive, when &s;wayed by &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>The will is always &s;ubordinate to &s;en&s;ation; for man is by nature conti|nually under the influence of &s;en&s;ibility, and can no more re&s;i&s;t its dictates, than he can will his own hurt, or oppo&s;e his happine&s;s.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Origin of the different Sentiments of the <HI>SOUL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The love of happine&s;s is innate in every heart, like the love of our&s;elves from which it is derived.</P>
<P>Every man loves him&s;elf; but nature, by creating him &s;ubject to wants, has not permitted him to love him&s;elf alone. The whole of his &s;en&s;ibility therefore cannot be centered within him&s;elf; there
<PB N="165" REF="173">are things in nature, to which he is connect|ed by the heart and affections. Man can|not, like the &s;upreme Being, be happy in the contemplation of him&s;elf, and with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others. The inex|pre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h we &s;uffer from the lo&s;s of a friend that was dear to us, flows only from a vacuity in the heart; rea&s;on di&s;|covers the void, and till &s;ome new object offers to po&s;&s;e&s;s it, our grief continues.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible beings can only be affected by plea&s;ure and pain. The &s;oul therefore receives only two kinds of &s;en&s;ations, the plea&s;ing and the painful: the&s;e two &s;en&s;a|tions are differently modified, but they are always di&s;tingui&s;hed by two general characters only. There are no indifferent &s;en&s;ations: tho&s;e which are &s;o called are but the lowe&s;t degrees of plea&s;ing or pain|ful &s;en&s;ations, too weak to influence the &s;oul, and determine its action. But as Man is a compound of two &s;en&s;ible &s;ub|&s;tances, and as each of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances has its particular object, there are two kinds of the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, and two kinds of the painful, viz. the &s;en&s;ations of the body, and the &s;en&s;ations of the &s;oul.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="174">The impre&s;&s;ions of objects on the &s;en&s;es are tran&s;mitted to the &s;oul, and there the &s;en&s;ations unite: hence the &s;oul partakes of the plea&s;ures and pains of the body; the &s;oul likewi&s;e has &s;en&s;ations which are peculiar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus all the good we enjoy, and all the evil we &s;uffer, proceed from two different &s;ources, viz. moral and phy&s;ical objects. Man therefore receives impre&s;&s;ions of plea|&s;ure both from objects which act on the body, and on tho&s;e which are purely in|tellectual: the latter are called the plea|&s;ures of the mind, and the former, bodily plea&s;ures. The &s;ame divi&s;ion will al&s;o ap|ply to painful &s;en&s;ations: and from the&s;e, according to the predominancy of either, proceed all the happine&s;s and mi&s;ery of human life.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t be careful to di&s;tingui&s;h &s;en|&s;ation from &s;entiment. <HI>Sen&s;ation</HI> is a plea&s;|ing or painful affection of the &s;oul, pro|duced by the impre&s;&s;ion of objects on the &s;en&s;es. <HI>Sentiment</HI> is a &s;trong affection of the &s;oul, produced by the relation which the under&s;tanding perceives between us and phy&s;ical or moral objects.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="175">Every object that affects us, if its &s;en|&s;ation be plea&s;ing, in&s;tantly creates in the &s;oul the &s;entiment of <HI>love;</HI> or, if its &s;en|&s;ation be the rever&s;e, the &s;entiment of <HI>ha|tred:</HI> for it is a con&s;equence of the love of our&s;elves, that we love what is profi|table to us, and hate what is prejudicial to us.</P>
<P>From the&s;e &s;entiments of love and ha|tred, combined with our different &s;itua|tions in re&s;pect of the objects of our &s;en|&s;ations, proceed many other &s;entiments. When we are agreeably affected by any object, which it is in our power to enjoy at will, a &s;udden plea&s;ing calm creeps on our &s;en&s;es, our wi&s;hes &s;eem &s;atisfied, the &s;oul &s;inks into joy, and is in&s;en&s;ible to every other &s;entiment. But if this object be not within our reach, the privation of it excites in the &s;oul de&s;ire, attended with a painful emotion. On the con|trary, if the &s;en&s;ation be di&s;agreeable, and we cannot avoid the impre&s;&s;ion of the object which cau&s;es it, we experience nei|ther joy nor de&s;ire; and &s;entiments of <HI>grief</HI> and <HI>aver&s;ion</HI> ari&s;e in the &s;oul.</P>
<P>From our different &s;ituations with re|gard to different objects, ari&s;e two other

<P>Hope and fear are affections of the &s;oul analogous to joy and &s;adne&s;s, and, as it were, &s;hades of the&s;e affections. Joy and &s;adne&s;s are extremely active &s;entiments: one &s;prings from the plea&s;ure of enjoy|ment; the other from the pain of &s;uffering.</P>

<P>I have &s;hewn, that whenever any object affects us, there ari&s;es in the &s;oul a &s;enti|ment of love or hatred for it; the cau&s;e of this has been already pointed our.

<P>But to continue our analy&s;is.</P>
<P>De&s;ire has always a &s;entiment of love for its ba&s;is, as aver&s;ion has a &s;entiment of hatred: and &s;ince every &s;entiment has an object, the &s;en&s;ations are therefore ab&s;olutely

Every pa&s;&s;ion, more or le&s;s, influences the actions of men: but as the ruling pa&s;&s;ion is their leading principle of action, it &s;tamps a general character on their whole conduct. When once it gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, it governs with an ab&s;olute &s;way, continually impelling it to the pur&s;uit of its object, independent of all the &s;ubordinate pa&s;&s;ions which oppo&s;e its career.</P>
<P>Every pa&s;&s;ion is grounded on love or hatred. Sometimes the pa&s;&s;ions are wholly confined to the&s;e &s;entiments; at
<PB N="175" REF="183">other times the&s;e &s;entiments are found u|nited with &s;ome others; as fear, hope, e&s;|teem, contempt, relatively to our &s;itua|tion in re&s;pect of the object of our love or hatred, and to the merit of the object with which we compare our&s;elves.

<P>The &s;imple pa&s;&s;ions of hatred and love a&s;&s;ume different denominations, according to their objects. Love becomes avarice, friend&s;hip, lu&s;t, ambition; according as it is directed towards riches, a friend, wo|men, honours.</P>
<P>And as every pa&s;&s;ion has &s;ome object, which affects either the &s;en&s;es or the mind, we further di&s;tingui&s;h them into &s;en&s;ual and artificial pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>To the former cla&s;s belong lu&s;t, glut|tony, drunkenne&s;s; to the latter, vanity, love of glory, and of all tho&s;e phantoms which opinion e&s;teems ble&s;&s;ings, and which &s;elf-love &s;o earne&s;tly hankers after.</P>

All men de&s;ire, in a greater or le&s;s degree, the plea&s;ures of the table, of the &s;ex, of mu&s;ic, odours, painting; but there are &s;ome men entirely without ambition, and others in|&s;en&s;ible to glory. One chiefly e&s;teems the trifling advantage of beauty, and &s;pends his life in admiring his bodily advantages: another takes a plea&s;ure in di&s;playing his large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and is delighted with the extreme pain he gives tho&s;e who envy his glory and happine&s;s: another finds charms in an indolent life, or in the &s;ilent contemplation of the wonders of na|ture.

<P>It has been &s;aid, that the pa&s;&s;ions are only the voice of the &s;en&s;es; and a phi|lo&s;opher of the pre&s;ent age has vainly tortured his brain to explain this paradox.</P>
<P>It is certain, that many pa&s;&s;ions are de|pendent on the &s;en&s;es, from the nature of their object; and many likewi&s;e are, in ap|pearance, continued onwards to the &s;oul by means of &s;ome fal&s;e relations, con|cerning which, we may ea&s;ily undeceive our&s;elves: but how many of the pa&s;&s;ions are wholly dependent on the mind? And how many of them have only imaginary objects?</P>
<P>The chief happine&s;s in a Roman tri|umph was no more than the plea&s;ure the victor took in dragging at his car vanqui&s;h|ed monarchs loaden with chains, and in
<PB N="178" REF="186">di&s;playing to the gazing populace the tro|phies of his proue&s;s; and the repeated ac|clamations of the public? The charms of love con&s;i&s;t &s;olely in the idea of being beloved by the object of our pa&s;&s;ion. Sen|&s;ual love has merely gro&s;s enjoyment for its end; but true love is only &s;atisfied with the heart.</P>
<P>Let us leave the &s;ophi&s;tical author <HI>de l'E&s;prit,</HI> to deduce every pa&s;&s;ion from phy|&s;ical &s;en&s;ibility; but he never can deduce from thence the love of glory, that vain incen&s;e which ignorance and wretchedne&s;s offer at the &s;hrine of power, valour, and genius, and whereof great minds are &s;o covetous.</P>
<P>To prove this, I will not plead that wit, genius, virtue, and the different ways men pur&s;ue to attain glory and fame, are not the paths which lead to fortune; that great talents are almo&s;t always the objects of en|vy; nor that, with the generality of man|kind, credit is preferred to de&s;ert; that the plea&s;ant companion and flattering para&s;ite, are more care&s;&s;ed than the Man of genius and the Man of virtue. But noble &s;ouls, &s;ouls eager after glory and fame, the &s;age and the hero, have been almo&s;t always
<PB N="179" REF="187">known to flouri&s;h in poor countries; and if virtue has ever &s;hone forth with lu&s;tre, it has been among tho&s;e nations where they had no rewards, but honours, to be&s;tow.

<P><PB N="187" REF="195">Hence, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the faculty of perceiving, judging, recollecting and chu&s;ing, the &s;oul could neither perceive, re|collect, judge, nor chu&s;e, unle&s;s united to an organized and &s;en&s;ible body; it would not even be con&s;cious of its own exi&s;tence, for it is only by reflecting on its &s;en&s;a|tions, it acquires this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Next after &s;en&s;ibility is unfolded in&s;tinct; then memory; after that the under&s;tand|ing, and la&s;t of all the will: however &s;ingu|lar this gradation may appear, it is how|ever the order ob&s;erved by nature in the unfolding of our faculties.</P>
<P>With regard to the time when this un|folding is accompli&s;hed, it varies with the con&s;titution of each individual; but this variation is incon&s;iderable. While the in|fant is in the womb, its organs are not in a &s;tate adapted to receive a perfect &s;en&s;ation; be&s;ides, in the fluid wherein it is contained, it is incapable of receiving any &s;en&s;a|tion, not even that of the fluid; ju&s;t as we perceive not the air when calm, &s;e|rene, and of equal temperature. But in a few days after birth, its &s;en&s;es are in a &s;tate adapted to receive the impre&s;&s;ion of objects; the &s;en&s;itive principle then ex|pands,
<PB N="188" REF="196">and begins to exert it&s;elf. The &s;en&s;itive faculty is &s;oon &s;ucceeded by that of the memory; the under&s;tanding pre|&s;ently follows; the infant compares its &s;en|&s;ations as &s;oon as it acquires the u&s;e of its &s;en&s;es, and in a &s;hort time is able to di&s;|tingui&s;h them. All this is done in about forty days; by this time the infant already knows its nur&s;e. The unfolding of the will immediately &s;ucceeds; for it is not long till the infant can di&s;tingui&s;h the dif|ferent objects of its &s;en&s;ations, and know plea&s;ure and pain: from this in&s;tant the innate de&s;ire of happine&s;s has its deter|minate object, and the will pur&s;ues &s;ome known good. Thus all the faculties of Man are rendered active a &s;hort time after birth; but there pa&s;&s;es a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time before they are perfectly develo|ped. The infant has at fir&s;t only parti|cular &s;en&s;ations; objects appear uncon|nected, and it di&s;tingui&s;hes them only by their different &s;en&s;ations: when the num|ber of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations are multiplied, the child compares them, perceives their iden|tity or difference, begins to range them in certain cla&s;&s;es according to analogy, and to form ideas.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="197">I have di&s;tingui&s;hed the operations of the under&s;tanding into rea&s;on and imagi|nation: by the former the &s;oul perceives the real relations of objects; by the latter, it invents imaginary ones.

<P>Each of the&s;e powers has its &s;eparate functions, but they cannot act &s;eparately: for, to produce thoughts, de&s;ires or pa&s;&s;ions, they mu&s;t unite and act in concert. Thus all the powers of the &s;oul act in conjunc|tion, and their operations are produced by their combination.</P>

<P>Although the faculty of thinking is inherent in the &s;oul, it neverthele&s;s does not always think. How frequently, in the cour&s;e of our lives, is the mind en|tirely engro&s;&s;ed by &s;en&s;ibility, while all its other faculties are &s;u&s;pended? Upon hear|ing any dreadful news, the blood chills, the
<PB N="192" REF="200">heart violently contracts, rea&s;on is extinct, and the &s;oul recoils within it&s;elf, and is in&s;en&s;ible to every thing but its cala|mity. In acute pain we have no internal &s;en&s;ation but that of our &s;ufferings. Hence there are moments, when the &s;oul does not think, and the&s;e are &s;ome|times &s;ufficiently long. Have you never ob&s;erved the &s;urprize of a clown, when he fir&s;t enters the theatre; at the ri&s;ing of the curtain, &s;truck with the wonders which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to his &s;ight, ab&s;orbed by objects &s;o uncommon, and as if he were be&s;ides him&s;elf in that en|chanted place, he never once reflects, but is entirely employed in contemplating the &s;cene, and his whole &s;oul re&s;ides in his eyes.</P>
<P>We can likewi&s;e &s;u&s;pend the activity of the judgment at plea&s;ure, and leave &s;en&s;i|bility to act alone. A lover of harmony, or eloquence, on hearing a beautiful pa&s;&s;age, or pathetic de&s;cription, retires within him&s;elf, and is, as it were, concen|trated in his &s;en&s;ibility. Does not an enthu|&s;ia&s;t, in the heat of devotion, &s;ometimes &s;u&s;|pend the activity of his judgment, that he may indulge him&s;elf in the enjoyment of a temporary &s;entiment that charms him?

<HEAD>Of the Exerci&s;e of <HI>SENSIBILITY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Sen&s;ibility can not only occupy the whole &s;oul, and mu&s;t not only concur in every operation of the mind, but is ince&s;&s;antly in action. While the &s;oul continues united to the body, it is con|tinually affected with &s;ome &s;en&s;ations, &s;ome new &s;entiment, or &s;ome &s;entiment reproduced. We may ea&s;ily be convin|ced of this, by ob&s;erving what pa&s;&s;es within our&s;elves.</P>
<P>The &s;oul may be affected with many different &s;en&s;ations at once; becau&s;e ma|ny &s;en&s;es can be affected, and the &s;ame &s;en&s;e may al&s;o be affected many ways, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The number of the&s;e different &s;en&s;a|tions is very great; neither is it po&s;|&s;ible to determine where it ends, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to fix the number of different
<PB N="195" REF="203">objects, which may act together on the &s;en&s;es; but the number of different &s;en|&s;ations, with which the &s;oul may be af|fected without confu&s;ion at the &s;ame time, is much more confined. On hearing a very complex mu&s;ical compo&s;ition, the ear is affected by every &s;ound of the &s;e|veral in&s;truments, but without being able to di&s;tingui&s;h them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have &s;een in London a young performer on the harp&s;icord, that could di&s;tingui&s;h the different tones of the &s;trings vibrating together, when any one ap|plied the fingers to the keys of the piano forte, or any other in&s;trument of the kind.</NOTE>. But whatever their number may be, to enable the &s;oul to di&s;|tingui&s;h the different &s;en&s;ations which af|fect it at the &s;ame time, they mu&s;t not be very lively; for if, among the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, there be one much &s;tronger than the others, it weakens them to &s;uch a degree, as nearly to annihilate them, and this with an energy proportioned to its &s;trength. There is likewi&s;e in &s;en&s;ations a degree of force which ab&s;orbs all our &s;en&s;ibility, as if in the&s;e moments the heart could not divide it&s;elf. It is thus, whil&s;t in the arms of a beloved mi&s;tre&s;s, that &s;o many agree|able &s;en&s;ations ari&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; but in
<PB N="196" REF="204">that happy moment which is the <HI>acme</HI> of our plea&s;ures, amid&s;t the delights in which we are lo&s;t, the &s;oul is only &s;en&s;ible to the mo&s;t ec&s;tatic, viz. to the prolific fluid as it is di&s;charged through the numerous cir|cumvolutions of its ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>When the &s;oul is ab&s;orpt by any &s;trong &s;en&s;ation, it continues in that &s;tate until this impre&s;&s;ion in&s;en&s;ibly decaying comes to be perfectly extinct, or until a &s;en&s;a|tion yet more &s;trong takes place.</P>
<P>The &s;oul cannot be affected by many &s;entiments at one time, as it is by many &s;en&s;ations; for the &s;en&s;es, which com|municate the impre&s;&s;ions of objects to the &s;oul are many, whil&s;t the under&s;tanding, which di&s;covers their relations, is but one. And it has been proved, that &s;enti|ments ari&s;e in the &s;oul by the relations which Man perceives between him&s;elf and other beings. The &s;en&s;es may like|wi&s;e be affected many ways at the &s;ame time, whil&s;t the under&s;tanding can fix on one relation only, as I &s;hall hereafter prove. There is, therefore, at one time, but one &s;entiment in the &s;oul, although it appear to be affected with a thou&s;and emotions at once. But as this operation of the un|der&s;tanding
<PB N="197" REF="205">is performed with inconceiv|able velocity, the&s;e &s;entiments ari&s;e, and are &s;ucceeded with &s;uch rapidity, that it is often impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the in|finitely &s;mall interval which &s;eparates them, whatever attention we may give to what is at that time tran&s;acting in the mind.</P>
<P>This is the rea&s;on why a thou&s;and &s;ad and agreeable &s;entiments &s;eem to divide the &s;oul between them, and why we &s;up|po&s;e it to be at once di&s;tracted with pain, and tran&s;ported with joy.</P>
<P>However impo&s;&s;ible it may be to di&s;tin|gui&s;h, by the internal feeling, the interval &s;eparating the&s;e rapid emotions, it is more &s;o to di&s;tingui&s;h them by their external &s;igns; becau&s;e the impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;en|timents, made on the corporeal organs, are much more durable than tho&s;e made on the &s;oul, Hence when the &s;oul is &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively under the power of impetuous emotions, which rapidly &s;ucceed each other, their different impre&s;&s;ions on the body con|tinue together. Ob&s;erve the unhappy father, who conducts his only &s;on to the altar of death; at the very time when the fear of the gods arms his hand, and he ap|plies the knife to the bo&s;om of his child,
<PB N="198" REF="206">paternal affection &s;u&s;pends the &s;troke, and he melts into tears.</P>
<P>If the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;entiments of the &s;oul be often imperceptible, it never|thele&s;s may &s;ometimes be perceived. There are but few who are accu&s;tomed to examine what pa&s;&s;es within them, who have not ob|&s;erved, that often, amid&s;t the agitations of the mind, a &s;entiment &s;hall ari&s;e and de|&s;troy that which preceded it; that though the &s;entiments are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively effaced in a di&s;turbed mind, they yet &s;pring up again in&s;tantly after; and la&s;tly, that the &s;oul, un&s;ettled, wavers between its different emotions: ju&s;t as, in a &s;ea agitated by the winds, we ob&s;erve the waves break one again&s;t the other and in&s;tantly re|appear.</P>
<P>In the conflict of the different &s;entiments with which the &s;oul is &s;ucce&s;&s;ively agitat|ed, as in the concour&s;e of the &s;en&s;ations, the &s;tronge&s;t always weakens the others, de&s;troys them, and reigns alone in the &s;oul.</P>
<P>When the friends of <HI>Pombey</HI> lamented his defeat after the dreadful &s;laughter at <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> &s;eized with fear at the approach of the Egyptian ve&s;&s;els, their grief made them dumb; each ones particular danger
<PB N="199" REF="207">prevented his being concerned for the common misfortune; they thought only of encouraging the &s;ailors, and &s;eeking their &s;afety by flight: as &s;oon as their fears were removed, the lo&s;s they had &s;uffered again came into their minds, and they again melted in tears. Thus nothing but extreme plea&s;ure can entirely deliver the &s;oul from profound grief; nor can any thing but inten&s;e pain create &s;adne&s;s in an heart overflowing with joy; every weaker affection glances, as it were, on the &s;oul, and makes no la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on it.</P>
<P>But when the&s;e &s;entiments are nearly of equal force, the &s;oul, as if un&s;ettled and wavering between contrary emotions, knows not which to re&s;olve on; its de&s;ires de&s;troy each other; &s;carce is it freed from its troubles, when it is involved in them anew; this indetermined &s;tate does not always terminate to the advantage of the mo&s;t powerful &s;entiment. After a long conflict, the &s;oul, wearied out with the efforts it has made, gradually lo&s;es its &s;en|&s;ibility and force together; and finally yields to the la&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, which thus remains ma&s;ter of the field.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="208">There is this difference between the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;ations and that of &s;enti|ments: in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new &s;en&s;ations, only the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;oul and the or|gans of &s;en&s;e are in action: but in that of the &s;entiments, &s;en&s;ibility, under&s;tanding and memory, mu&s;t always concur: for it is the under&s;tanding, which, by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of analagous &s;en&s;ations, furni&s;hed by the &s;en&s;es or by the memory, gives ri&s;e to our &s;entiments, and occa&s;ions their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.

<HEAD>Of the Exerci&s;e of the <HI>UNDERSTANDING.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Let us here di&s;tingui&s;h exactly what is peculiar to the under&s;tanding while in exerci&s;e, from that which is peculiar to the other faculties. Thinking is a pro|perty of the under&s;tanding, but the un|der&s;tanding alone is not &s;ufficient to pro|duce it. The judgment is employed in determining the relations of things, and as we may either judge of ab&s;ent objects or of tho&s;e which are pre&s;ent, &s;en&s;ibility and memory therefore are combined with the under&s;tanding in forming our judg|ments, as has been already ob&s;erved: in the&s;e two faculties the under&s;tanding perceives objects, in the &s;ame manner as
<PB N="202" REF="210">we behold our&s;elves in a gla&s;s, if I may be allowed to make the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Our judgments are often formed with|out our concurrence, and &s;ometimes in &s;pite of our utmo&s;t efforts to the contrary; in &s;uch ca&s;es, the will has no &s;hare. But if thought &s;ometimes take place without the concurrence of the will; at other times, the will concurs with &s;en&s;ibility and memory in the excerci&s;e of the under|&s;tanding; for the under&s;tanding is a fa|culty, the exerci&s;e whereof we can &s;u&s;|pend and govern as we think fit. We can at will, determine the &s;oul to the con&s;i|deration of external objects, and after|wards turn our thoughts inwards with|in the mind, in order to compare and combine them in different manners at plea|&s;ure, and judge of their relations. The exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding is therefore both voluntary and involuntary. I have di&s;tingui&s;hed two different powers in the under&s;tanding: that of perceiving, exa|mining, and comparing objects; and that of judging of their relations. It is the fir&s;t only of the&s;e powers which concurs with the will; for we cannot refrain from judging of any relation which pre&s;ents it|&s;elf
<PB N="203" REF="211">to the mind. If, however, we at times can &s;u&s;pend our judgment, it is by prolonging the exerci&s;e of the former of the&s;e powers, without which there can be no judgment, and not by employing the other.</P>
<P>The voluntary u&s;e of this power con|&s;titutes attention; for what is the atten|tive confideration of any object, but the fixing the exerci&s;e of this intellectual fa|culty on its impre&s;&s;ion, communicated to the &s;oul by the organs of &s;en&s;e, or pre|&s;erved by the memory?</P>
<P>As we can perceive a certain number of &s;en&s;ations at once, our attention may be &s;hared among a certain number of objects; but the &s;maller this number of objects is, <HI>coeteris paribus,</HI> the &s;tronger is the atten|tion, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> This is evident in ab&s;ence of mind, but much more &s;o in the catalep&s;y<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The catalep&s;y is a very uncommon indi&s;po&s;ition of the foul. Phy&s;icians have hitherto, without rea|&s;on, taken it for a di&s;ea&s;e of the body, and have treat|ed it as &s;uch. But a more attentive con&s;ideration of the phenomena of nature would have convinced them, that it is only a &s;imple affection of the &s;oul; as the body is at &s;uch a time in perfect health, and regularly performs all its functions. The catalep&s;y is, properly &s;peaking, but inten&s;e thought, wherein attention is carried to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree, or, if you will, wherein the &s;oul is violently affected, and, as it were, concentrated within it&s;elf. Hence none are &s;ubject to the catalep&s;y but per&s;ons of great &s;en&s;ibility, and &s;uch as are affected by exce&s;&s;ive plea&s;ure or exce&s;&s;ive grief, which, as they dare not confide to any one, they are condemned to mourn or rejoice inwardly. Such are hypochondriacs; devotees, enthu&s;ia&s;ts, amorous per|&s;ons, but more e&s;pecially &s;edentary women, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are naturally more violent than tho&s;e of men, and who&s;e inactivity continues the mind intent upon the object which has once got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. We &s;hall be ea&s;ily convinced of this, if we con&s;ider the &s;ymptoms which accompany this &s;uppo&s;ed malady. Of the following ca&s;e I my&s;elf was witne&s;s. A wo|man of a very choleric temperament, and much given to the reading of books of devotion, had all the &s;ymptoms which are found united in the mo&s;t complicated ca&s;es: &s;he was &s;ubject to frequent wanderings in her di&s;cour&s;e; which &s;he would break off abruptly, and become motion|le&s;s; her eyes remained open and fixed, but &s;he could nei|ther &s;ee, hear, nor feel; &s;he &s;elt no pain from punctures in her fle&s;h, and was in&s;en&s;ible of the mo&s;t violent agita|tions: like a &s;tatue of &s;oft wax, her limbs were flexible, and retained any po&s;ture in which they were placed by chance or otherwi&s;e; her pul&s;e not only continued to beat, but was even quicker than u&s;ual, and her com|plexion likewi&s;e was more florid and lively; after con|tinuing in this &s;ituation for &s;ome time, her body began to move, like a per&s;on awaking from a trouble&s;ome &s;leep, fetching many deep &s;ighs; &s;he gradually reco|vered, but retained no remembrance of what had pa&s;|&s;ed, and with a &s;eeming exta&s;y related her vi&s;ions. Now wherein does this &s;tate differ from that of a &s;tu|dious per&s;on, who indulges him&s;elf in profound medi|tation, except in that it is a &s;tronger attention? And are not the&s;e the vi&s;ions of a &s;oul mo&s;t violently affected?
<P>But &s;ome will reply, that a great di&s;order of the organs of the head has been di&s;covered by di&s;&s;ection in per&s;ons who have been &s;ubject to the catalep&s;y. "In &s;ome, the ve&s;&s;els which pa&s;s from the ba&s;is of the <HI>cere|brum</HI> to the <HI>&s;inciput</HI> were di&s;tended with thick blood, and the po&s;terior part of this vi&s;cus was humid with &s;ero|&s;ities; in others, the anterior part of the <HI>cerebrum</HI> has been found hard, its ba&s;is &s;oft and humid, and the prin|ciples of the nerves &s;mall and dry." But what does this prove? What are the&s;e appearances but the natu|ral effects of the violent ten&s;ion of the mu&s;cular fibres, and of the lo&s;s of &s;pirits which ever accompanies pro|found meditation; as I &s;hall hereafter demon&s;trate? Are not the <HI>&s;ta&s;es</HI> of fluids, and the ob&s;truction of ve&s;|&s;els, the ordinary effects of that diminution of organi|cal ela&s;ticity, which en&s;ues from this violent ten&s;ion? Is not the extrava&s;ation of the &s;erous part of the fluids the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the &s;ta&s;es? Is it not evi|dent that phy&s;icians, in their &s;agacious re&s;earches into the cau&s;es of this imaginary di&s;ea&s;e, have taken the ef|fect for the cau&s;e, when they cited the&s;e ob&s;ervations?

<P>A circum&s;tance which yields the mo&s;t demon&s;trative evidence, and proves the &s;ound &s;tate of the organs of the head in this &s;uppo&s;ed malady is, that in the lo&s;s of knowledge, which &s;ucceeds the di&s;orders of this organ (&s;uch as the intume&s;cence of the brain and inflammation of its membranes) the &s;oul lo&s;es every degree of &s;en&s;e, as in the apoplexy, &s;ycopes, deliquia, but is con&s;cious of its condition in the catalep&s;y.</P></NOTE>, a di&s;order wherein the

<PB N="205" REF="213">with the body. Undoubtedly the force of attention depends on the number of objects which the under&s;tanding con&s;iders at once; yet it likewi&s;e depends on the force of the
<PB N="206" REF="214">will; for the will is &s;u&s;ceptible of dif|ferent degrees of inten&s;ene&s;s, as are the motives determining it. We can at plea&s;ure u&s;e efforts more or le&s;s violent, to con&s;ider an object; we can dimini&s;h attention, or augment it to &s;uch a degree, that it &s;hall appear entirely to engro&s;s the &s;oul.</P>

<P>The faculty of judging is natural to the &s;oul, but is properly free only when &s;en|&s;ibility
<PB N="207" REF="215">is not affected by any object be&s;ides tho&s;e of our judgments: when the &s;en&s;a|tions are &s;trong, they always di&s;turb the exerci&s;e of thinking; when extremely &s;o, they de&s;troy it entirely. In this latter ca&s;e, there is no judgment; becau&s;e the mind is entirely engro&s;&s;ed by a new object: in the fir&s;t ca&s;e there is, it is true, a judg|ment, but this is an erroneous one. The new &s;en&s;ations, not having &s;ufficient force entirely to engage the attention, divide it; being thus obliged to employ it on diffe|rent objects, the mind cannot &s;ufficiently con&s;ider tho&s;e of which it is to judge; &s;o that it confounds them, and forms fal&s;e and ab&s;urd judgments. This is very evi|dent in per&s;ons agitated by pa&s;&s;ions. Amid&s;t their emotions, the &s;oul cannot come to any prudent determination; &s;ometimes it forms a multitude of weak re&s;olutions, and extravagant projects, and is unre&s;olved which to prefer: at other times, full of the object by which it is affected, it con|founds every thing in the judgments it makes with this object, and is no longer attentive to rea&s;on. This is the cau&s;e why profound meditation takes place only when
<PB N="208" REF="216">the pa&s;&s;ions are calm, in &s;ilence and in &s;olitude.</P>
<P>The exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding is either re&s;trained or interrupted when &s;en|&s;ibility is &s;trongly affected; and, by a ve|ry &s;ingular phenomenon, when the under|&s;tanding is clo&s;ely employed, the impre&s;|&s;ions of external objects upon the &s;en&s;es appear weakened, &s;ometimes null, as we ob&s;erve in ab&s;ent per&s;ons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the rea&s;on why an ab&s;ent per&s;on &s;ometimes looks for his &s;pectacles and has them upon his no&s;e, and why cataleptics have no knowledge of what is acting about them.</NOTE>, <HI>in tho&s;e who walk in their &s;leep,</HI> and in cataleptics.

Not that the exerci&s;e of this faculty inter|rupts the commerce of the &s;oul with the body, as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed; the under|&s;tanding neither adds to, nor takes from the force of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, and they re|main perpetually the &s;ame; it is becau&s;e we judge not until the under&s;tanding has
<PB N="209" REF="217">con&s;idered the objects of which it is to judge; that is, we never judge without employing attention: and becau&s;e with|out attention, the impre&s;&s;ions of objects on our organs, and even the &s;en&s;ations renewed by the memory are, to the &s;oul, as if they had no exi&s;tence: it therefore appears, that the &s;oul cannot be attentive to &s;en&s;ations from without, when it is immer&s;ed in profound meditation.</P>
<P>There may be many &s;en&s;ations in the &s;oul at one time, but never more than one judgment; the faculty of judging not being divi&s;ible like that of perceiving.

The mind may very ea&s;ily perceive all the&s;e objects at once, but to judge of their relations, it mu&s;t compare them, examine them one after another, in &s;ome determinate point of view, and reduce them to a fixed &s;tan|dard: now the mind can examine objects, but in one point of view at a time. Thus the under&s;tanding can, at the &s;ame time,

<HEAD>Natural Succe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>THOUGHTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Since the under&s;tanding in its operations is combined with the will, the mind can transfer at plea&s;ure its thoughts to different objects, without any connexion of ideas, and form what we may term &s;eparate judgments; but this is not the order which the mind pur&s;ues in thinking, when left to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the almo&s;t imper|ceptible connexion ob&s;ervable in the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of our ideas, and ob&s;erve their de|pendencies, we evidently perceive, that the mind, in its progre&s;s, always proceeds by analogy. When we are alone walking in the fields, if a voice much re&s;embling that of a friend, &s;trike the organ of hear|ing, or a colour like that of his coat oc|cur to the &s;ight, his image immediately pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the mind, we recollect &s;ome peculiar circum&s;tance, and recall &s;ome former di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e analogies, which con&s;titute the a&s;&s;ociation and link of our thoughts, are
<PB N="211" REF="219">not always perceived; but they rarely e&s;|cape us, if we recollect our&s;elves, and lei&s;urely ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of the un|der&s;tanding.

Hence it is evident, that the mind proceeds only by analogies, both when it is wrapt in profound meditation, and when ab&s;orbed within it&s;elf; and never appears to rove from thought to thought, nor from one &s;ubject to another, however extravagant or unconnected its thoughts may appear; &s;ome relation, either &s;light or &s;triking, forms the tran&s;ition, and &s;ome analogy perceived, either real or appa|rent, pre&s;ents the new object to the mind; if we except the &s;ingle in&s;tance when the &s;oul, forced from its pre&s;ent thoughts by &s;ome violent and fudden &s;en&s;ation, inter|rupts the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas, and the pro|gre&s;s of the under&s;tanding.

<P>I have &s;aid that rea&s;on judges of the true relations of objects, and that the ima|gination invents ideal ones.</P>
<P>To judge of the true relations of ob|jects, they mu&s;t be always pre&s;ent in the mind, and be &s;ubject to attentive examination; but attentive examination is not always nece&s;&s;ary to invention; for in the&s;e ca&s;es it is &s;ufficient to connect the qualities of one &s;ubject to tho&s;e of ano|ther, and to confound them in the &s;ame whole. If we attentively follow the pro|gre&s;s of the under&s;tanding, we &s;hall be convinced, that thought always becomes imagination when it cea&s;es to be rea&s;on, and that in the point where the one ends, the other begins. When attention is di&s;|continued, the object which engaged us is no longer fixed; it therefore changes to the fir&s;t &s;en&s;ation with which the &s;oul is afterwards affected; the mind employed on this new object combines it with every thing that offers, as it happens in tho&s;e indeterminate reveries, into which the &s;oul falls after long meditation, or in tho&s;e
<PB N="213" REF="221">gentle dreams which &s;ucceed laborious exerci&s;e. Hence tho&s;e extravagant fic|tions, and phanta&s;tic ideas, we have in our dreams.</P>
<P>The object of our thoughts changes with every new &s;en&s;ation which affects the &s;oul; but, for want of the action of ex|ternal objects on our organs, this &s;en&s;a|tion is almo&s;t continually &s;upplied by the &s;oul it&s;elf, led by a &s;ecret bias towards the mo&s;t alluring object. The imagination is therefore directed to its object by the pa&s;&s;ion, and the nature of its thoughts is determined by that of the &s;entiment which affects us. Whil&s;t the &s;oul is under the power of any gentle emotion, the mind employs it&s;elf in augmenting its plea&s;ures; then retiring within it&s;elf, it &s;ecretly com|bines this &s;entiment with &s;ome analogous object, from which it derives &s;imilar ideas. The&s;e are tho&s;e plea&s;ing fancies, and flat|tering delu&s;ions, which con&s;titute the chiefe&s;t enjoyments and principal happi|ne&s;s of our tran&s;itory exi&s;tence. This is the ca&s;e in the delirium of love: during its continuance we enjoy a flattering dream; the mind is for ever recalling the object of its pa&s;&s;ion; it engro&s;&s;es our whole

<P>Thinking is a power inherent in the mind, but is, in its natural &s;tate, without rule, choice, or attention: all our judgments are at this time irregular and incoherent, nor is there any nece&s;&s;ary connexion be|tween the &s;ubject and the attribute. This is ob&s;erved during &s;leep: when the &s;en&s;es are at re&s;t, the mind di&s;ports with diffe|rent

<P>When the under&s;tanding continues to operate in Man when awake, in the &s;ame manner as when he is a&s;leep, this acci|dental &s;tate thus become permanent, is termed <HI>madne&s;s:</HI> but when our judgments are regular, and there is a connexion between the &s;ubject and attribute, this order of our thoughts is called <HI>wi&s;dom.</HI> What con&s;titutes the whole of the difference between wi&s;dom and madne&s;s is there|fore attention, which is always attendant on the latter, but never on the former; for we may indeed think without this di&s;|po&s;ition of the mind, but cannot reflect. If the child that prattles, and the old man who dotes, are both of them incapable of rea&s;oning, it is not becau&s;e they have no ideas, as &s;ome have imagined, but be|cau&s;e they are equally devoid of attention: one has never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, and in the other, it is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rea&s;on of this I &s;hall a&s;&s;ign hereafter.</NOTE> decayed.</P>

<P>The faculty of perceiving, comparing, and examining objects, in conjunction with the will, is the cau&s;e of rea&s;on and regu|lar
<PB N="217" REF="225">thought<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, thought directed to &s;ome end.</NOTE> Regular thought takes different denominations, according to the different degrees of attention the mind requires in forming its judgments, com|bined with the nature of their objects, and the direction of the exerci&s;e of the un|der&s;tanding. It retains the generic appel|lation of <HI>thought,</HI> when this degree of at|tention is &s;mall, whatever may be the ob|ject of our judgments and duration of this exerci&s;e. It is called <HI>reflection,</HI> when this degree is more con&s;iderable; and <HI>meditation,</HI> when it is extreme.</P>
<P>To reflect, is to think attentively; but reflection differs from thought, in &s;o far, as the latter is applied to every kind of object indi&s;criminately; whil&s;t the former takes place with regard to ab&s;ent objects only; that is, with regard to tho&s;e which are re|newed by the memory: for to reflect, is to examine whether our thoughts be true; it is the comparing our judgments with their objects, and a&s;certaining known re|lations. Thus, after having applied our &s;oul to the perception of external objects, we retire within our&s;elves to con&s;ider,
<PB N="218" REF="226">compare, and combine them after various manners.</P>
<P>Meditation has the &s;ame objects which reflection has, but it differs therefrom not only in the degree of attention, as I have already ob&s;erved, but al&s;o in the duration of thought: reflection is the a&s;&s;emblage of many thoughts in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; medita|tion is a long &s;eries of deep reflections.</P>
<P>Regular thought is a painful and irk|&s;ome &s;tate of the mind. If our inward feelings afford not &s;ufficient documents of this, it will be ea&s;ily proved by what pa&s;&s;es within us in con&s;equence of our ex|ternal actions.</P>
<P>Examine Man during infancy: whil&s;t at liberty, he indifferently follows every path that leads to plea&s;ure, obeys every im|pre&s;&s;ion of external objects, amu&s;es him&s;elf with exerci&s;e, goes, comes, runs, &s;tands &s;till, and acts ever without any purpo&s;e, and from no motive whatever; he thinks very little, reflects yet le&s;s, and never meditates at all. If at any time he re&s;t, or direct his acti|ons to &s;ome end, or if he rea&s;on ever &s;o lit|tle, it is always by compul&s;ion, becau&s;e he hears his ma&s;ter's voice, and feels the yoke of nece&s;&s;ity. But as &s;oon as he is out of
<PB N="219" REF="227">the &s;ight of his trouble&s;ome guardians, he re&s;umes his character, and thinks no more than ju&s;t what he cannot help, and then only that he may give full &s;wing to the im|pul&s;e of the &s;en&s;es: thus a &s;pring com|pre&s;&s;ed regains its ela&s;ticity, when the com|pre&s;&s;ing power is removed.</P>
<P>Nece&s;&s;ity obliges Man to reflect in in|fancy; the &s;ame cau&s;e likewi&s;e obliges him to reflect when arrived at maturity. No|thing but the &s;en&s;e of pre&s;ent, and the apprehen&s;ion of future wants, can impel the mind to reflection. It is the pa&s;&s;ions which give ri&s;e to the productions of ge|nius, and to the wonders of art: without the&s;e powerful incentives, the mind would langui&s;h in li&s;tle&s;s indolence; and men, like &s;avages, would &s;pend their lives in a momentary contemplation of the objects &s;urrounding them, or el&s;e, in &s;leep.</P>
<P>But if thought be painful, it is only in proportion to the degree of attention it requires, and to the efforts more or le&s;s &s;trong, which are nece&s;&s;ary to the know|ledge, or to the formation of relations.

<HEAD>Some &s;ingular Phenomena explained, con|cerning the Effects of the Pa&s;&s;ions on the <HI>UNDERSTANDING.</HI></HEAD>
<P>How different is the pro&s;pect of na|ture, according to the different &s;entiments which affect us!</P>
<P>In the horror of de&s;pair, rage and fe|rocity are accounted heroi&s;m. In the fury occa&s;ioned by &s;lighted love, we look on every woman as perfidious; if a mi&s;tre&s;s prove fal&s;e to us, from her we e&s;timate the whole &s;ex; then, all the &s;ex are &s;laves to vanity and &s;elf-intere&s;t. In the gloomy paroxi&s;ms of jealou&s;y, a rival appears in colours much le&s;s amia|ble in our &s;ight, than when our heart was free from that illiberal pa&s;&s;ion. How frequently does terror conceal the object which cau&s;ed our fears!</P>
<P>A man, when agitated by any pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ees not objects, or if he &s;ees them, it is not in the &s;ame light as when he was free from their influence; but what is mo&s;t &s;ingular, in the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, we always &s;ee objects in the &s;ame manner. Does the &s;oul overflow with joy? We find charms unknown before in every object near
<PB N="224" REF="232">us; they change their nature in our eyes, and become more plea&s;ing and more beau|tiful than before.</P>
<P>The garden where the di&s;graced cour|tier endeavoured to forget his cares, on re|ceiving the news of his recal, &s;eems the haunt of &s;ome beneficent being, who has drawn a&s;ide the veil, which before con|cealed its beauties from his &s;ight; the flowers appear of a richer hue, their forms &s;eem more agreeable, and their odours more delicious; the air is embalmed, an uni|ver&s;al change &s;ucceeds, and all is full of grace and beauty.</P>
<P>Is the &s;oul affected with &s;adne&s;s? Nature is covered with a gloomy veil; its defor|mity is enhanced, and all its beauty fades.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;entiment may affect us, the cozenage of the pa&s;&s;ions always &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, the face of nature is perpetually changing in our eyes. If we love, the object of our pa&s;&s;ion acquires additional charms. Ob&s;erve an ardent lover, let the per&s;on of his mi&s;tre&s;s be ever &s;o homely, every part is beautiful, charming, divine! The black is a &s;prightly brunette. The gigantic a maje&s;tic; the meagre a delicate beauty. And if his pa&s;&s;ion be extreme, this home|ly,
<PB N="225" REF="233">brown, gaunt, meager creature, cea&s;es to be a woman; &s;he becomes an angel.</P>
<P>When hatred on the contrary takes po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, the object of our indigna|tion becomes di&s;agreeable; and our enemy, whatever merit he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, is then ill fa|voured and odious. And even the ob|jects formerly our delight are altered and disfigured by it. When the &s;lighted lover, who imagined his mi&s;tre&s;s an angel while his affection continued in its force, cea&s;es to love, the illu&s;ion in&s;tantly vani&s;hes, and the &s;ight of the lovely face, which before excited &s;o many plea&s;ing emotions, now produces a very oppo&s;ite effect: his mind being re&s;tored to its former &s;tate, views with a&s;toni&s;hment the former object of his love, and is &s;urprized how he could fix his affections on &s;uch features. He a&s;ks him&s;elf how he could po&s;&s;ibly ad|mire her; and all tho&s;e bewitching charms, all tho&s;e heavenly graces are either not &s;een, or &s;een with indifference. But if hatred &s;ucceeds, the object changes yet more, the few beauties that remained are ob&s;cured, elegance becomes deformity, and by a kind of prodigy, hatred degrades an object as much as love exalts it. Such in general
<PB N="226" REF="234">are the delu&s;ions of the pa&s;&s;ions; were I to repeat their many &s;pecies, I &s;hould never have done.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect of nature ever varies with the pa&s;&s;ion, and always in the &s;ame pro|portion: if this change gradually, that al&s;o varies in&s;en&s;ibly; if this change is in&s;tan|taneous, the other is altered with the &s;wiftne&s;s of lightning. Thus the &s;enti|ment we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with, con&s;tantly changes the face of nature; like a magi|cian, pa&s;&s;ion extends its delu&s;ive enchant|ments to every object, and never &s;uffers us to view them but through a fal&s;e per|&s;pective. Whence ari&s;es this phenome|non? And what is this hidden charm, which the pa&s;&s;ions &s;pread over all nature? Wherefore does love embelli&s;h, and ha|tred disfigure its objects?</P>
<P>Of the authors who have attempted to account for the&s;e phenomena, &s;ome attri|bute it to the imagination; others to the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>The former &s;ay, <Q>That in love, for in&s;tance, the imagination repre&s;ents to us tho&s;e images which are analogous to the &s;entiment in the mind; that the pa&s;&s;ionate lover, while his pa&s;&s;ion con|tinues,
<PB N="227" REF="235">&s;ees not in his mi&s;tre&s;s her true image, but a creature of the fancy, and takes the beauty, which he him&s;elf &s;tamps thereon, to be really that of the object.</Q> But if we carefully examine what pa&s;&s;es in our minds at that time, we &s;hall be convinced, that this illu&s;ion is not the effect of the cau&s;e to which it is here attributed; and &s;hould this internal feel|ing not convince us, it would be very ea&s;y to &s;atisfy our&s;elves thereof, by exa|mining facts.</P>
<P>The colourings which the pa&s;&s;ions com|municate to objects, always change as the pa&s;&s;ions: if the pa&s;&s;ion changes by de|grees, the&s;e colourings vary in&s;en&s;ibly: if the pa&s;&s;ions are in&s;tantaneou&s;ly altered, the colourings change with equal rapidity. The &s;ame cau&s;e which produced the illu|&s;ion in this latter ca&s;e, is that which pro|duced it in all the other ca&s;es. It is there|fore clear, that in this &s;udden change, the illu&s;ion is not the effect of imagination, &s;ince no idea has entered the &s;oul whil&s;t the change is making; the under&s;tanding has not even time to act, nor the imagi|nation to form any picture.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="236">They who attribute the&s;e phenomena to an alteration in the &s;en&s;es, occa&s;ioned by the emotions of the mind, re&s;t on no better grounds; for objects continue al|ways the &s;ame, they in like manner al|ways produce on our organs &s;imilar im|pre&s;&s;ions, and the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions are com|municated to the &s;oul always in the &s;ame manner. Neither do the &s;en&s;es undergo any change, and their organic con&s;titu|tion is always the &s;ame. It is therefore evident, that the&s;e phenomena neither have their cau&s;e in the organ which re|ceives this impre&s;&s;ion, nor in the organ which propagates it; but only in the &s;oul which receives it.</P>
<P>The colourings, which the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion communicates to objects, are always the &s;ame in all ca&s;es; and whether the pa&s;&s;ion change by imperceptible degrees or in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly, the colourings change in the &s;ame manner; the pa&s;&s;ion and the illu|&s;ion decay one after the other by the &s;ame gradations. Hence, &s;ince objects are ever the &s;ame, and &s;ince the &s;ame object changes with the &s;entiment in the mind, the&s;e phenomena are to be imputed to the pa&s;&s;ion only. It is love only, therefore,
<PB N="229" REF="237">which decks out the idol of our hearts, and lends it its charms without our per|ceiving it.</P>
<P>But what is the cau&s;e of this deceitful charm, which pa&s;&s;ion communicates to objects? If we attentively con&s;ider the matter, we &s;hall di&s;cover the &s;imple and evident cau&s;e of this &s;urpri&s;ing phenome|non to be in the &s;entiment we then enter|tain.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the &s;oul &s;ees not ex|ternal objects out of the body; it does not even &s;ee them in the organs of the &s;en&s;es, but in it&s;elf; and there the pro&s;|pect of nature is &s;een<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book I. Art. of the body, con&s;idered as the ge|neral organ of &s;en&s;e and motion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;entiment affects the mind, the illu&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;ions almo&s;t conti|nually embelli&s;hes or deforms objects, and increa&s;es or dimini&s;hes their impre&s;&s;ions. On the other hand, the impre&s;&s;ions of objects are confined to the producing a|greeable or painful &s;en&s;ations<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame may be &s;aid with regard to the ideas of objects: all the&s;e relations or attributes <HI>fine, good, pret|ty, amiable, charming, noble, heroic, ugly, frightful, mean, wicked,</HI> are only &s;o many agreeable or di&s;agreea|ble ideas. A lover thinks no woman hand&s;ome or a|miable, but as &s;he re&s;embles his mi&s;tre&s;s; this con|formity is the mo&s;t agreeable quality another can po&s;|&s;e&s;s in his e&s;timation.</NOTE> of dif|ferent
<PB N="230" REF="238">kinds, all of them in different de|grees, but for ever retaining the&s;e two characteri&s;tics. The&s;e &s;en&s;ations are con|tinually exciting in the &s;oul; the one, &s;en|timents of joy, the other, &s;entiments of grief.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;entiment which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;oul whil&s;t under the influence of any pa&s;|&s;ion, and that which ari&s;es from the im|pre&s;&s;ion of objects, being analogous, the &s;entiment re&s;ulting from their union mu&s;t be &s;tronger than either of them &s;ingly, and &s;tronger in proportion to the &s;trength of the pa&s;&s;ion, and to the number of ana|logous &s;en&s;ations. But ob&s;erve, that in every new &s;en&s;ation, this compound &s;en|timent is wholly felt, and the &s;oul then &s;uppo&s;es it to be the effect of a &s;imple &s;en&s;ation: the under&s;tanding, &s;uppo&s;ing that to be a particular effect, which is the effect of &s;everal cau&s;es, attributes to the impre&s;&s;ion of objects that which &s;hould only be attributed to the di&s;po&s;i|tion
<PB N="231" REF="239">of the &s;oul. It is thus that pa&s;&s;ion embelli&s;hes, deforms, magnifies, and al|ters objects, and communicates its colour|ings to every thing in nature. Let us endeavour to render this truth more evi|dent, by applying it to &s;ome example.</P>
<P>In every pa&s;&s;ion &s;ome &s;trong &s;entiment prevails in the &s;oul; in happy love, for in&s;tance, joy predominates. If, whil&s;t engro&s;&s;ed by this plea&s;ing &s;entiment, the &s;oul be affected by any agreeable &s;en&s;a|tions be&s;ides; the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from them, is always accompanied with the in|ternal &s;entiment which then occupies us; thus augmented, the plea&s;ure appears more &s;trong, and the &s;en&s;ations more agreeable. In the &s;elf-&s;ame manner, joy, whil&s;t the &s;oul is affected with love, com|municates its plea&s;ing influence to the im|pre&s;&s;ions of the &s;en&s;es; thus too it em|belli&s;hes its object, and lends it new charms. Hence in a &s;tate of convale&s;|cence, the joy of having recovered a good we had lo&s;t, gives the country a more plea&s;ing appearance, and renders the view of it more affecting, than when we are in health. The &s;oul, for a long time op|pre&s;&s;ed by a violent di&s;ea&s;e, expands upon
<PB N="232" REF="240">the return of health, and gives a loo&s;e to the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of prolonged ex|i&s;tence: and hence ari&s;es that delightful &s;entiment, which produces the agreeable emotion we then feel at the pro&s;pect of nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This likewi&s;e is the cau&s;e why a favour, received from the hand of a tender friend, is more agreeable than when received from the hand of a &s;tranger; and, in a word, why pre&s;ents receive &s;uch additional value rom the donor.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If the &s;entiment, which predominates in the &s;oul during the continuance of a pa&s;&s;ion, renders more &s;trong the impre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e objects, which are analogous to it, it mu&s;t needs impair that of objects which are of a contrary kind. Hence it is, why in &s;adne&s;s nature appears cover|ed with a gloomy veil, and is le&s;s agree|able to the &s;ight. This is the cau&s;e why jealou&s;y dimini&s;hes the merit of a rival, and why hatred disfigures objects as much as love adorns them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Such likewi&s;e is the cau&s;e of tho&s;e frequent altera|tions in our appetite for different meats, odours, and modes, &s;o erroneou&s;ly attributed to habit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Although the &s;entiments, which proceed from the pa&s;&s;ions and &s;en&s;ations, be recipro|cally
<PB N="233" REF="241">cally impaired, when they are of an oppo&s;ite nature, yet they do not de&s;troy each other but when they are nearly of equal force; otherwi&s;e, the conte&s;t terminates always to the advantage of the &s;tronger. Thus when hatred is weak, we allow our enemy &s;ome &s;mall &s;hare of merit, and likewi&s;e in &s;light pains, we &s;ometimes yield to the impul&s;e of plea&s;ure, and when grief is not exce&s;&s;ive, a &s;mile will &s;ometimes e&s;|cape us.</P>
<P>Although the &s;entiments, re&s;ulting from pa&s;&s;ions and the impre&s;&s;ions of exter|nal objects, be more lively when the pa&s;|&s;ions and impre&s;&s;ions are analogous, and weaker, when the rever&s;e; they are only &s;o, when moderate; for when either is extremely violent, their re&s;pective &s;en|timent ab&s;orbs all attention, and reigns alone in the &s;oul. This is the cau&s;e of that blindne&s;s ob&s;erved in per&s;ons &s;trongly affected with any pa&s;&s;ion: and this is the rea&s;on why terror oftentimes conceals the object which occa&s;ioned it; why joy makes no impre&s;&s;ion on a &s;oul overwhelmed with &s;adne&s;s, and why grief finds no admit|tance into a heart which is always en|gro&s;&s;ed by joy.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="242">Pa&s;&s;ion frequently renders us blind, deaf, in&s;en&s;ible, and objects continually receive their colourings from the di&s;po&s;i|tion of the &s;oul; but there is &s;omething yet more &s;urprizing in the illu&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;ions, for they can make us even &s;ee objects which do not exi&s;t. Fear &s;ome|times produces &s;ingular deceptions of the &s;ight: it is fear which repre&s;ents to the credulous, the dead ri&s;ing from their tombs; which, to the benighted traveller, who wanders through &s;olitary woods, transforms trees into men, &s;ets before his eyes, in the thicke&s;t darkne&s;s, gho&s;ts and goblins, and makes him imagine he hears the groans of per&s;ons in the agonies of death.</P>
<P>In a fit of enthu&s;ia&s;m, they who are &s;aid to be in&s;pired, at times, enjoy heavenly vi&s;ions, they conver&s;e with houris and an|gels, whil&s;t a thou&s;and phanta&s;tic beings are &s;een by them as clearly as if they re|ally exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>This phenomenon has long perplexed philo&s;ophers, nor have they &s;ucceeded bet|ter in their explanation of this, than of the preceding; they pretend, that <Q>the nervous fluid in this ca&s;e commands
<PB N="235" REF="243">the &s;oul, and that, particularly in the organ of &s;ight, it &s;ucce&s;&s;ively takes all the modifications, repre&s;entative of ob|jects by which it has formerly been af|fected.</Q> I would willingly know on what they built this &s;trange opinion. By what means are they a&s;&s;ured that the fluid of the nerves communicates to the &s;oul the image of objects, without the con|currence of the objects them&s;elves? Is not this a mere &s;uppo&s;ition? But the&s;e philo|&s;ophers di&s;cover the marvellous in things, which are in them&s;elves the mo&s;t &s;imple. This phenomenon, which is &s;o &s;ingular when the&s;e vi&s;ions are taken for the effect of the impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;en&s;es on the &s;oul, cea&s;es to be &s;o when we con&s;ider that the pro&s;pect of nature is in the &s;oul. We mu&s;t neither &s;eek, out of our&s;elves, nor in the organs of &s;en&s;e, but in the &s;oul it|&s;elf, for tho&s;e mon&s;trous images, tho&s;e &s;pectres, and phantoms, which the an|cients fancied to be departed &s;ouls or gho&s;ts, e&s;caped from <HI>Acheron,</HI> and which modern philo&s;ophers look upon as &s;en&s;a|tions, reproduced on the &s;en&s;es by the fluid of the nerves.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="244">Whil&s;t preyed on by any violent pa&s;&s;ion we may, indeed, direct our &s;ight towards the objects which &s;urround us, but we do not perceive them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This happens in the catalep&s;y.</NOTE>, or rather we are al|together uncon&s;cious of their impre&s;&s;ions. Full of the pre&s;ent &s;entiment, the &s;oul is engro&s;&s;ed by one object, and is inattentive to every other; it cannot then oppo&s;e truth to error, and illu&s;ion is inevitable; for it is only by the attention we give to objects, that we can di&s;tingui&s;h in the &s;oul their real impre&s;&s;ions from their images repro|duced, which the under&s;tanding then pre|&s;ents to us and a&s;&s;ociates with them. This is the rea&s;on why, in extreme terror, man cannot compare his &s;en&s;ations with the objects which &s;urround him, nor recollect the circum&s;tances, according to which his apprehen&s;ions may be either real or ima|ginary. Incapable of con&s;idering whether the&s;e objects be real or only ideal, he takes the illu&s;ory images which pre&s;ent them|&s;elves to the mind for objects really exi&s;t|ing. Thus &s;leep lends to the phanta&s;ms of a dream all the characteri&s;tics of reality: whil&s;t the &s;en&s;es are at re&s;t, and attention is &s;u&s;pended, the images of the objects
<PB N="237" REF="245">which have formerly affected us, are re|traced in the mind, and that with &s;o great exactne&s;s, that we frequently imagine we &s;ee and hear tho&s;e who have been long dead. In the &s;ame manner we fancy we &s;ee the &s;un in his meridian lu&s;tre, &s;urround|ed with thick darkne&s;s. And in the &s;till &s;ilence of the night we imagine we hear &s;ounds, and that we are tran&s;ported to a different climate. Thus the lover believes he &s;ees the mi&s;tre&s;s of his affections, that he hears her charming voice, and that he cla&s;ps her in his arms; &s;ometimes his dream changes, and the dear object of his de&s;ires vani&s;hes and deludes his eager em|braces. And many times the ideal &s;cene is &s;o &s;trongly painted, that we undergo violent agitations, &s;tretch out our arms, ri&s;e from our beds, and pur&s;ue the empty vi&s;ions, till awaking, we recover our &s;en&s;es, and are &s;orry to find our&s;elves undeceived.</P>
<P>Such are the true cau&s;es of tho&s;e &s;ingu|lar phenomena which have baffled philo|&s;ophers, and which no one as yet has been able to account for.</P>

<PB N="238" REF="246">
<HEAD>Of the Exerci&s;e of the <HI>MEMORY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The &s;oul may be affected at the &s;ame time with many &s;en&s;ations, and never but with one idea; but what an immen&s;e number of &s;en&s;ations, &s;entiments, and ideas, are retained at once in the memory!</P>
<P>As the memory is a merely pa&s;&s;ive faculty, all tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations, ideas, and &s;entiments, which are depo&s;ited in this magazine, are as if non-exi&s;tent, till the under&s;tanding pre&s;ent them to the mind. Without this intellectual power, the memory would be wholly u&s;ele&s;s, our thoughts being always effaced one by the other, the fruit of our experience would be lo&s;t to us; and the pa&s;t, for ever obliterated by the pre&s;ent, would be as if it had never been.</P>
<P>We can indeed chu&s;e the object we would depo&s;it in the memory, by apply|ing the &s;oul to it with attention; but we cannot modify any thing depo&s;ited in the memory, nor exclude that which is once admitted there.</P>
<P>I have demon&s;trated how this faculty, combined with &s;en&s;ibility, under&s;tanding and will, becomes <HI>recollection</HI> and <HI>remem|brance;</HI>
<PB N="239" REF="247">I &s;hall not here repeat what I have &s;aid el&s;ewhere upon this &s;ubject, but confine my&s;elf to ob&s;ervations of a differ|ent kind.</P>
<P>The exerci&s;e of the memory depends on the under&s;tanding; the&s;e two faculties in this re&s;pect are &s;ubject to the &s;ame laws. It is only by the aid of &s;ome relations between the pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ations or ideas, and tho&s;e which are pa&s;t, that the latter are retraced in the mind. In a delirium, in folly, in dreams, where all things ap|pear unconnected, and di&s;ordered, the renewing of our &s;en&s;ations or ideas is perfected only by the means of analogy, ju&s;t as when we are awake, although their connection be not preceived; for whatever objects we recollect, they have always &s;ome relation to &s;ub&s;equent or preceding objects.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ations and &s;entiments are always more active in the in&s;tant when we receive them, than when renewed by the memo|ry; hence the &s;trength of the pa&s;&s;ions is augmented by the pre&s;ence of their object.</P>
<P>When Coriolanus, with an heart full of re&s;entment, marched again&s;t his coun|try, no ob&s;tacle could re&s;train him: threats
<PB N="240" REF="248">and intreaties were in vain; he &s;at down to be&s;iege Rome. The &s;ight of his na|tive city, recalled the idea of the wrongs his fellow citizens had done him, and gave it new vigor: his fury was inflamed, &s;o that he breathed nothing but revenge, and was on the point of carrying fire and &s;word into the bowels of his country. Whil&s;t the&s;e emotions prevailed, his mother, wife, and children, pre&s;ented them&s;elves before him in tears; the &s;ight of the&s;e dear objects in&s;tantly awakened in his heart the &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s, which be|fore had given place to revenge; his firm|ne&s;s relented; all &s;entiments of hatred became extingui&s;hed, and the cruel plea|&s;ure of revenge was &s;ucceeded by the love of his family, his friends, his coun|try, and his Gods.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and other examples of this kind, equally convincing, might be adduced: the man who has long lived in adver&s;ity, if fortune &s;uddenly become propitious, on hearing the happy change in his condition, can hardly re&s;train his joy; and during all the while that he is detained from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his trea|&s;ure, his imagination is continually occu|pied
<PB N="241" REF="249">with the plea&s;ures he promi&s;es him|&s;elf; he enjoys no re&s;t, no quiet: ob&s;erve how his eyes gli&s;ten at the &s;ight of the &s;acred metal; tran&s;ported with joy, the emotions affecting him can no longer be confined within the &s;oul; but notwith|&s;tanding all his efforts to &s;uppre&s;s them, they break out in quick and &s;udden mo|tions.</P>
<P>In like manner, in a criminal condemn|ed to die, fear continually increa&s;es his terror, gathers &s;trength as the hours elap&s;e, and the fatal in&s;tant approaches; brought to the place where he is to &s;uf|fer, he &s;hakes with horror at the &s;ight of what he is to undergo, his blood congeals in the ve&s;&s;els, and his &s;trength fails him with exce&s;s of fear.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions derive additional force from the pre&s;ence of their object. It is by a con|&s;equence of this law that &s;o many projects expire in their birth, that &s;o many &s;ecret re&s;olutions prove abortive, and that we re|frain from all freedom of di&s;cour&s;e when the tyrant appears. It is this law which aug|ments the trouble of a guilty mind, as well as the inward &s;atisfaction of a truly peni|tent
<PB N="242" REF="250">heart, as they approach the great day of account.</P>
<P>Hence the impre&s;&s;ions of objects, which are &s;o &s;trong when fir&s;t received, being tran&s;mitted to the memory, gradu|ally decay in proportion to the interval be|tween the time when they are fir&s;t receiv|ed, and that when they are recollected. Time, which de&s;troys every thing, &s;eems to exerci&s;e the &s;ame power on our &s;ouls: our &s;en&s;ations, &s;entiments, ideas, like characters engraven on marble, gradually wear out, and at la&s;t are wholly oblite|rated.</P>

<P>We can fix our &s;en&s;ibility on any object; we can &s;elect tho&s;e we will to depo&s;it in the memory, and apply the under&s;tand|ing to the con&s;ideration of any of the&s;e at plea&s;ure: the&s;e faculties of the &s;oul are therefore in this re&s;pect dependent on the will.</P>
<P>The &s;ame laws appear in the regular exerci&s;e of the faculties which are ob&s;erved in the voluntary and mechanic motions of the body; the &s;oul can employ them in any determinate de&s;ign, can attend at plea&s;ure
<PB N="243" REF="251">to any particular object of its choice, and requires only a &s;imple determination of the will to continue this attention. Sen|&s;ibility, memory and under&s;tanding, in cer|tain re&s;pects are dependent on the will, but this in its turn is al&s;o &s;ubject to &s;en|&s;ibility. Examine the will in any relation you plea&s;e, you will ever find it to be di|rected by &s;entiment, by the love of plea|&s;ure and aver&s;ion to pain, even when it ap|pears to &s;eek this, and to renounce the o|ther.</P>
<P>The love of happine&s;s, is what makes the unfortunate feel the vanity of this life, arms his hand with the in&s;trument of fu|ry, and turns it again&s;t him&s;elf. The &s;ame cau&s;e excites the fanatic and devotee to fa&s;tings, mortifications and &s;elf-denial of every kind: from this proceeds that holy rage, which makes them &s;hed their own blood, and expire in the agonies of &s;elf-inflicted torments.</P>
<P>All our faculties are therefore differently connected, the one with the other. Sen|&s;ibility, always &s;ubject to the impre&s;&s;ion of external objects, is &s;ometimes influenced by the will. Memory has for its ba&s;is the &s;en&s;ations and ideas, and never appears
<PB N="244" REF="252">without the aid of &s;en&s;ibility and of the under&s;tanding. The under&s;tanding con|tinually requires the concurrence of &s;en|&s;ibility, of memory, and frequently of the will. The will likewi&s;e is it&s;elf &s;ub|ject to &s;entiment. Such is the connexion of our intellectual faculties, a mo&s;t admi|rable connexion, whereby the&s;e different powers unite in the &s;ame operations, in a manner &s;o gentle, &s;o imperceptible, as to require a con&s;iderable degree of ingenuity to perceive it.</P>

<HEAD>Particular <HI>OBSERVATIONS</HI> on the <HI>SENSATIONS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I have ob&s;erved, that there may be many moderate &s;en&s;ations in the &s;oul at one time, but never more than one extremely powerful &s;en&s;ation. The force of the latter mu&s;t therefore be much greater than the force of the others combined. This is not becau&s;e their multiplicity impairs the &s;en&s;itive principle, and that they really acquire force, in proportion as their num|ber is dimini&s;hed; but becau&s;e a very &s;trong &s;en&s;ation occupies the whole &s;oul, and wholly engages its attention; at that time
<PB N="245" REF="253">the others are of no effect; they undoubt|edly are tran&s;mitted to the &s;oul, but are no longer admi&s;&s;ible there. Hence the le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility is divided between different &s;en&s;ations, the greater is the force of each particular &s;en&s;ation. The &s;en&s;ations, therefore, mu&s;t be unconnected, to retain their full power.</P>
<P>It is not &s;o with the &s;entiments of joy and &s;adne&s;s, which are produced in the &s;oul by the&s;e &s;en&s;ations. In the concur|rence of analogous &s;en&s;ations, which to|gether affect the &s;oul, their union produces the mo&s;t powerful effects; for the &s;econd object which the &s;oul di&s;covers, adds to the plea&s;ure produced by the fir&s;t, and this plea&s;ure is yet farther increa&s;ed, by the charms of the next new object which &s;ucceeds it. The more the&s;e &s;en&s;ations are multiplied, the &s;entiment formed from their combination mu&s;t be the more &s;trong, the &s;oul being at once affected in many different parts.</P>
<P>A tempe&s;t &s;trikes the &s;pectator with horror, but this horror is much in|crea&s;ed, if the atmo&s;phere appear on fire, if the winds are in their fu|ry,
<PB N="246" REF="254">and peals of thunder &s;hake heaven's concave.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect of a fine country, illu|mined by the &s;etting &s;un, and gilded with his departing rays in the evening of a &s;erene day, imparts joy to the &s;oul; the coolne&s;s of the air, the delightful melody of birds, the murmurs of &s;ome gentle &s;tream, the odours of flowers and ea&s;y motion of the fanning zephyrs, enhance the plea&s;ure of the &s;cene, and wholly en|gage the heart.</P>
<P>In the plea&s;ing, as in the terrible, the concurrence of analogous &s;en&s;ations com|po&s;e all that is great and magnificent in the &s;cene, and the irregular a&s;&s;emblage of plea&s;ing and frightful objects, together with the variegation of the whole, forms an engaging pro&s;pect, which charms the heart or terrifies the &s;oul by means of the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>We have &s;een that different &s;en&s;ations mu&s;t be unconnected to produce their full effect; but by a &s;ingular phenomenon, the united force of the analogous &s;en&s;a|tions, which affect the &s;oul at the &s;ame time, is incomparably greater, than that of the &s;ame &s;en&s;ations when they act &s;ingly. In
<PB N="247" REF="255">the inchanting pro&s;pect of a fine land&s;cape at &s;un-ri&s;ing, not only every new object, every new &s;en&s;ation, adds to the plea&s;ure produced by the others; but what is more to be admired, every &s;en&s;ation becomes more inten&s;e, and every object is embel|li&s;hed with the charms of that which &s;uc|ceeds it; the odours of flowers renders their colour more agreeable, and the &s;weet breath of zephyr adds harmony to the warbling of the birds. Each of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations therefore acquire force by their union and mutual concurrence. The cau&s;e of this phenomenon is very &s;imple; for to the plea&s;ure produced by one, is uni|ted that of the others. The &s;entiment of plea&s;ure, formed from the&s;e particular &s;entiments, mu&s;t then be more power|ful, and the impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;en&s;ation more efficacious, as I have proved el&s;e|where. Analogous &s;en&s;ations therefore gain by their union, as much as contrary &s;en&s;ations lo&s;e thereby. Hence the rea&s;on why wine is more plea&s;ing, if, be&s;ides its flavour, it be of a brilliant colour, and yet more agreeable, if drank out of a ve&s;&s;el of chry&s;tal than if out of a ve&s;&s;el of &s;tone. This is the cau&s;e why, in tho&s;e places of
<PB N="248" REF="256">public entertainment where people go to kill time, the want of proper decorations renders the performance le&s;s intere&s;ting; and why a dre&s;s, which has been long in wear, degrades the merit of an actor, and le&s;&s;ens the enjoyment ari&s;ing from the re|pre&s;entation.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Force of the <HI>PASSIONS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The &s;ource of every pa&s;&s;ion is the love of &s;elf, and this &s;entiment is of equal force in every individual; for nothing can be conceived &s;uperior to that love which every one entertains for him&s;elf: this &s;en|timent has likewi&s;e the &s;ame degree of force in every individual; as Man never prefers another to him&s;elf. The pa&s;&s;ions, however, are not of equal force in every per&s;on; as they derive not their power from their &s;ource, but from &s;en&s;ibility; by which both plea&s;ure and pain is e&s;ti|mated. If it be a law of nature to love that which is beneficial, and to hate that which is hurtful to us, it is likewi&s;e a law of nature to love or hate objects, in pro|portion to the good or ill they do us. The force of the pa&s;&s;ions is then propor|tionate, in every individual, to his &s;en&s;ibili|ty: but that is not the only cau&s;e of their
<PB N="249" REF="257">difference; their force varies likewi&s;e with the nature of their objects.</P>
<P>Every pa&s;&s;ion is a con&s;uming fire which carries its heat into the &s;oul, and animates it with new vigour; but all the energy and power of the &s;oul is owing to the ar|tificial pa&s;&s;ions only. That voluptuous emotion which renders one &s;ex nece&s;&s;ary to the other, is gentle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let us not confound love in the &s;tate of nature, with that artificial love wherein the &s;en&s;es are inflamed by the imagination, although the heart be not deter|mined exclu&s;ively towards any particular object.</NOTE> and moderate in the &s;tate of nature, that is, when imagi|nation is excluded; the lu&s;tful ardour, which renders that harmle&s;s animal, the &s;tag, furious, is not perceived in Man. Is the body over-charged with prolific fluid? Man feels the impul&s;e of nature, and yields to its &s;ugge&s;tions with delight, but is never furious. It is only, when con&s;ide|rations of a kind entirely different from his phy&s;ical con&s;truction happen to be added to this impul&s;e, and when the ima|gination, finding in the object tho&s;e ideas of beauty and merit which are of our own creating, magnifies the allurements thereof, makes us believe our &s;overeign
<PB N="250" REF="258">good depends on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and by this means turns the gentle &s;enti|ment of love into an immoderate pa&s;&s;ion. Like a devouring fire, it ince&s;&s;antly preys on him who is in&s;pired with it, and makes him endure all &s;orts of hard&s;hips, encoun|ter every danger, and even &s;pill his blood for its gratification: &s;o that this terrible pa&s;&s;ion, when in its fury, &s;eems rather cal|culated to de&s;troy, than to pre&s;erve the hu|man &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The other &s;en&s;ual pa&s;&s;ions are not more violent than love, in the &s;tate of nature; as they may then ea&s;ily be curbed, they put us to little trouble for their gratifica|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neither let us confound the fear of death, which ever accompanies the want of aliments, with the plea|&s;ure of &s;atisfying hunger.

In any public calamity, as in a &s;iege where famine prevails, there is nothing the be&s;ieged would not freely give to procure bread; they would even be happy to purcha&s;e it at the price of all they have in the world.</NOTE>: whil&s;t the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing effects have been produced by the artificial pa&s;&s;i|ons in all ages.

It was this love which prompted the pacific and ju&s;t <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> to a very uncommon in|&s;tance of moderation: made him re&s;pect the liberty of his ungrateful country-men, when it was in his power to have en&s;laved them, and be contented with the condition of a private citizen, when he might have been ma&s;ter of the commonwealth; for this, he continually governed him&s;elf by the laws of rigid virtue, and pre&s;erved, through the cour&s;e of his life, a mind un&s;ullied by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of an ill action. To the &s;ame love is to be attributed the incor|ruptible virtue of <HI>Cato,</HI> that image of the

<P>The artificial pa&s;&s;ions produced all tho&s;e great actions, who&s;e &s;plendor dazzles our imperfect &s;ight, and all tho&s;e great per&s;on|ages, who&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing actions appear fabulous to us, in the&s;e times when virtue is no longer in its ancient e&s;teem.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Combination of the <HI>PASSIONS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Every pa&s;&s;ion is founded on the love of plea&s;ure, and hatred of pain, two &s;enti|ments which are common to all men; the &s;ame &s;oul is therefore &s;u&s;ceptible of every pa&s;&s;ion indi&s;criminately, yet they all can|not prevail in it at once, and &s;ome pa&s;&s;ions exclude others, and <HI>vice ver&s;a:</HI> thus avarice excludes love of pomp, as the love of glo|ry excludes that of re&s;t.</P>
<P>There is never more than one pa&s;&s;ion predominant in the &s;oul, at the &s;ame time, though it is frequently di&s;tracted by many different pa&s;&s;ions: but the great|er the number of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This mu&s;t be under&s;tood of the artificial pa&s;&s;ions only.</NOTE>, the le&s;s is the force of any particular one. Not that the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;oul is di|vided by their multiplicity, for each one, acting &s;eparately, occupies the &s;oul entire; but as the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions act in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, no one of them has time to make any &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion thereon. It is the imagination which adorns the idol of our hearts, and is continually &s;etting it off with new charms; by degrees its beauties are
<PB N="254" REF="262">improved to &s;uch a degree, as to daz|zle and bewitch the mind, and we fool|i&s;hly adore the work of our own hands, pant after the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this phan|tom, and wa&s;te a con&s;iderable part of life in the pur&s;uit of it.</P>
<P>De&s;ire is formed in the &s;oul, as &s;oon as the under&s;tanding has perceived the rela|tions between the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an object and our happine&s;s; but it decays not im|mediately after its formation; it even con|tinues a while, without di&s;ordering the or|dinary cour&s;e of our thoughts.</P>
<P>Our de&s;ires are reciprocally combined in different manners, according to their ana|logy and diver&s;ity. The pa&s;&s;ions, which re&s;ult from objects which are unconnected, act in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; the mind pa&s;&s;es from one to another, however imperceptible this tran&s;ition may be, and is then divid|ed between contrary emotions, &s;o that this action is weakened thereby.</P>
<P>Of this nature is the pain a lover feels, on quitting his mi&s;tre&s;s to join the army and engage in war: &s;uch as the poet re|pre&s;ents the departure of <HI>Achilles</HI> from <HI>Deidamia,</HI> to the &s;iege of <HI>Troy:</HI> agitated by contrary emotions, his &s;oul long wa|vers
<PB N="255" REF="263">betwixt love and glory; he goes at la&s;t, but not without grief, and in a man|ner which evidently demon&s;trates his irre|&s;olution.</P>
<P>Contrary pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;ing in the mind reci|procally weaken each other. Thus in que&s;|tions about matters incapable of demon&s;tra|tion, and merely probable, the certainty of the mind is le&s;s when the under&s;tanding is divided by contrary ideas. But in the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of analogous pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;ucceed|ing &s;entiment acts in concurrence with that which is already acting on the heart, and their united force communicates a double impre&s;&s;ion to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Rome, yet free, could boa&s;t &s;he had within her walls citizens, who had en|riched them&s;elves with the &s;poils of van|qui&s;hed nations, the love of liberty and glory, together with the de&s;ire of pre|&s;erving the wealth they had acquired, was the &s;ource of the &s;uperior courage of that people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;oldier was the exclu|&s;ive right of a common citizen, the rich &s;oldiers al|ways di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves the mo&s;t, as the dangers they were obliged to undergo were greater than that of others: in a word, the ri&s;k of life was common, that of goods particular.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><PB N="257" REF="265">When love is no more than the volup|tuous emotion which inclines one &s;ex to the other, it is periodical, and is felt only when the body is overcharged with pro|lific fluid: Man therefore waits the impul&s;e of nature ere he re&s;igns him&s;elf thereto; his want &s;atisfied, he has no longer de&s;ire, and love is extinct. The duration of plea&s;ure can only &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the imagina|tion, not in the &s;en&s;es, however ardent tho&s;e of lovers may be. During their &s;hort delirium, their greedy eyes, and im|patient hands, know not which charm to &s;elect; in the moment of enjoyment they eagerly cla&s;p the object of their de&s;ires, and in an univer&s;al tremor, impre&s;s the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate ki&s;&s;es: at the approach of that delicious &s;en&s;ation, the &s;ummit of plea&s;ure, their tran&s;ports, how greatly in|crea&s;ed! Their embraces how furious! Over-powered with exce&s;&s;ive plea&s;ure, their &s;ouls meet on their eager lips, and pre&s;s each other, as if they would grow together. But the moment the prolific fluid is ejected, the fire which before con&s;umed them is extin|gui&s;hed, until, recalled to plea&s;ure by new de&s;ires, again they kindle, again love over|whelms the &s;oul: after a few paroxy&s;ms
<PB N="258" REF="266">of this paradi&s;aic delirium, and a few mo|ments enjoyed in fluttering from flower to flower, a frigid languor &s;ucceeds, and the happy pair, now without pa&s;&s;ion and without de&s;ires, &s;igh for repo&s;e, and are eager to part.</P>
<P>How different is the ca&s;e when the imagination lends charms to love! When the beauties of the beloved object are ex|aggerated in the lover's eyes; when imagi|nation repre&s;ents his mi&s;tre&s;s as the perfect model of every excellence, and holds forth to his eyes his whole and only felicity as centered in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her. Then only the lover becomes an enthu&s;ia&s;t, and a flame is lighted up within him, which continues unextingui&s;hed for years. When at length he has enjoyed the object of his de&s;ires, the tender emotions of his heart continue after enjoyment, the charm re|mains when the delirium of the &s;en&s;es is no more. Refined charm! Delightful &s;entiment! Begotten by admiration, and fo&s;tered by e&s;teem and re&s;pect; it forms a chain which time cannot di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P>When cruel de&s;tiny has deprived a ten|der mi&s;tre&s;s of her lover, her wounded heart demands him from heaven; in the

<P>The duration of the pa&s;&s;ions is likewi&s;e relative to their degree of force; for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;entiments is ever in propor|tion to their vivacity, as is that of phy&s;i|cal &s;en&s;ations.

<P>To conquer a pa&s;&s;ion, nay, even to will it, the &s;oul mu&s;t con&s;ider and examine the rea&s;ons why it is to act in this manner, and why it ought to refrain from acting; it mu&s;t &s;hew the &s;uperior advantage of re&s;t to action; but as the impul&s;es of &s;enti|ment
<PB N="262" REF="270">are rapid, &s;o the arguments which rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts proceed but &s;lowly, and the pa&s;&s;ions have already determined Man, before he can deliberate on what he ought to do. For the pa&s;&s;ions feel the pre&s;ent good; and rea&s;on only fore&s;ees in the con&s;equences of things, the good which is to come: the objects of the pa&s;|&s;ions &s;trongly affect us, as being pre&s;ent to the &s;ight; whil&s;t tho&s;e of rea&s;on are im|paired by their remotene&s;s, and always yield to the impre&s;&s;ions of the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>O rea&s;on! thou boa&s;ted recour&s;e of the wi&s;e, how can thy feeble voice prevail again&s;t the violence of the pa&s;&s;ions? What effect can it produce on a &s;oul in di&s;pair, or overpowered by the fury of the &s;en&s;es? Since the a&s;&s;i&s;tance thou give&s;t appears &s;o little efficacious, allow me to doubt, whether at that time, thou art capable of admini&s;tering any.</P>
<P>When affected with the tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;oul does not reflect, nor can the voice of rea&s;on be heard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Art. on the exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding. Book 2, pag. 201.</NOTE>: like a pi|lot in a ve&s;&s;el that has lo&s;t its anchor, and is to&s;&s;ed at the plea&s;ure of the winds; over|come by the fury of the tempe&s;t, he quits
<PB N="263" REF="271">the helm and lets it drive, and is him&s;elf an u&s;ele&s;s incumbrance in the ve&s;&s;el which he can no longer govern.</P>
<P>Such is the boa&s;ted power of rea&s;on! How vain then is wi&s;dom, &s;ince it leaves Man defencele&s;s in the time of danger, and only affords him a&s;&s;i&s;tance when it is not wanted!</P>
<P>In the impetuous pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;oul, un|able to make any oppo&s;ition, gives way to their violence, calm rea&s;on is &s;ilent; or, if it retain any &s;mall &s;hare of activity, it &s;erves only to render them yet more ungo|vernable. Wholly intent on &s;ome pre|&s;ent enjoyment, like the predominant &s;entiment, it is &s;educed by the allurements of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, and acts in concert with it, in pur&s;uing the &s;ame object. A pa&s;|&s;ive &s;lave during the tempe&s;t, no &s;ooner is it &s;ub&s;ided, when, in&s;tead of admini&s;|tering comfort in our misfortune, it joins with the &s;en&s;e of our unhappine&s;s, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts it in depre&s;&s;ing the heart. An help|le&s;s friend in danger, it abandons us in our nece&s;&s;ity, goes over to the enemy, and re|turns not till after we have &s;uccumbed, and then only, to add to our confu&s;ion. Thus ever applauding or cen&s;uring, when it is too
<PB N="264" REF="272">late, it can only &s;erve to give its &s;anction to our errors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Book 2. pag. 223. Art.

Thus the &s;oul, having no defence again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions, is carried away by their violence, and Man is nece&s;&s;itated to &s;ur|render to &s;entiment. The empire of rea|&s;on therefore con&s;i&s;ts altogether in our hav|ing no pa&s;&s;ions either to repre&s;s or &s;ubdue.</P>
<P>To how little an extent is this power of the &s;oul reduced! How trivial this prero|gative, in the enjoyment of which philo|&s;ophers have &s;o greatly exulted!</P>

<HEAD>A right Judgment of the Force of the <HI>SOUL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In the cour&s;e of human life, wherein Man is &s;o variou&s;ly affected, the pa&s;&s;ions are the only principle of his actions; but it is not action which con&s;titutes the force of the &s;oul, it is the re&s;i&s;tance which the &s;oul oppo&s;es to the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Who then can properly be &s;aid to be endowed with force of &s;oul? Not a boi&s;|terous
<PB N="265" REF="273"><HI>Achilles,</HI> regardle&s;s of every dan|ger; not an ambitious <HI>Alexander,</HI> who laid wa&s;te the globe with fire and &s;word; not an au&s;tere <HI>Cato,</HI> who tore out his bowels with his own hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every per&s;on committing &s;uicide, de&s;ires only to avoid the &s;ight of his mi&s;eries, which he cannot en|dure with patience: death is not an object of fear to him; it is life only which he dreads.</NOTE>: as they were alike unable to with&s;tand their pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o they all fell victims to them; the fir&s;t, to his ambition, the &s;econd, to voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, and the la&s;t, to grief. The man who de&s;|pi&s;es plea&s;ure and pain, faces danger without fear, receives, with indifference, the &s;trokes of adver&s;e fortune, and &s;u&s;tains them with an ea&s;y firmne&s;s, He, in my opinion, is truly endowed with force of &s;oul. In morals as in phy&s;ics, force is di&s;tingui&s;hed into active and pa&s;&s;ive; but let us di&s;tingui&s;h ever &s;o often the facul|ties of the &s;oul from each other, and the &s;oul it&s;elf from its faculties, we &s;hall ne|ver perceive any thing like the&s;e two kinds of power in Man; we may, indeed, per|ceive an active power, viz. &s;entiment, but never any counterpoi&s;e. Not that it is impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train the impetuo&s;ity of
<PB N="266" REF="274">the pa&s;&s;ions; this may be done, doubtle&s;s, by oppo&s;ing the one again&s;t the other, that is, by &s;ubjecting the &s;oul to many, in or|der to deliver it from the tyranny of one. Man, therefore, being thus the feeble &s;port of his pa&s;&s;ions, is continually nece&s;&s;itated to &s;ubmit to their tyranny; ju&s;t as a &s;lave, condemned to perpetual &s;ervitude, is ever changing his ma&s;ters, and has it not even in his power to chu&s;e what tyrant he will &s;erve.</P>
<P>Let us then conclude, that if the force of the &s;oul con&s;i&s;ts in commanding our pa&s;&s;ions, none can, properly &s;peaking, be &s;aid to be endued therewith: whatever has been advanced on that head is ab|&s;urd; for to de&s;troy the empire of the pa&s;&s;ions, we mu&s;t de&s;troy &s;en&s;ibility it&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>Of the feigned Force of the <HI>SOUL.</HI></HEAD>
<P><Q>Were not <HI>Socrates,</HI> who calmly drank the poi&s;oned bowl; <HI>Seneca,</HI> who ex|pired in the bath, conver&s;ing with his friends; <HI>Zeno,</HI> who overcame both plea|&s;ure and pain, and denied him&s;elf every thing which might enervate the &s;oul, endued with this force of the &s;oul?</Q> Do you imagine the&s;e &s;ages did not act
<PB N="267" REF="275">under a ma&s;k? Do you think that <HI>Socrates</HI> or <HI>Seneca</HI> met death without apprehen|&s;ion? From the bitter reproaches which one of them uttered again&s;t the tyrant, who had commanded his execution, is it not evident, that he yielded unwillingly to his de&s;tiny? And even, if the other had not demeaned him&s;elf &s;o as to plead his cau&s;e, and if his &s;oul, prepared by the continual exerci&s;e of wi&s;dom, had not given that mark of timidity, who can al|low him&s;elf to believe, that <HI>Socrates</HI> did not act a borrowed part? In vain he en|deavoured to conceal his inward feelings, under an air of &s;erenity, and an unfaulter|ing voice; the &s;oul trembled within him, and his trouble mu&s;t have appeared, not|with&s;tanding this vain di&s;gui&s;e, to a di&s;|cerning &s;pectator. The pro&s;pect of a pain|ful death will always &s;trike terror; none can view it without &s;hrinking: the wretch who, overwhelmed in de&s;pair, has re&s;olv|ed to take away his own life, and calls on death to help him to &s;trike the blow, he|&s;itates; his arm, though lifted up, refu&s;es to &s;trike, and he is forced to inflame his re&s;olution with the recollection of his mi|&s;ery, till &s;ummoning all his re&s;olution and
<PB N="268" REF="276">de&s;pair it&s;elf, at la&s;t he perpetrates the deed, but not without turning his head a&s;ide from an act which he dares not be|hold.</P>
<P>The force of the pa&s;&s;ions is proportion|ate to the degree of &s;en&s;ibility, and the degree of &s;en&s;ibility is only known by the force of the pa&s;&s;ions. When the heart is free from every connection, and all &s;en&s;i|bility is centered in the mind, Man ap|pears in&s;en&s;ible; he can even believe him|&s;elf to be &s;o.</P>
<P>When the object of the pa&s;&s;ion affect|ing the &s;oul is &s;uch, that it may be en|joyed in &s;ilence, as that of pride, Man even then appears in&s;en&s;ible; but it is to others only, for his &s;en&s;ibility is not un|known to him&s;elf. We cannot perceive the pa&s;&s;ions of others but by their exterior appearance, yet they exi&s;t not the le&s;s for their not being vi&s;ible. What would become of the principle of human actions, were Man dive&s;ted of &s;en&s;ation and &s;entiment? What motive taken from their own fund could tardy wi&s;dom or calm rea&s;on &s;upply.</P>
<P>When Man has di&s;covered the &s;ecret of re&s;training the pa&s;&s;ions, by making them act one again&s;t the other, and of forming them
<PB N="269" REF="277">in battle array, and, as it were, front oppo&s;ed to front, in the heart, he has found that of balancing the &s;oul, pre&s;erving it in an equi|librium, concealing his inward &s;mart un|der a &s;erene out&s;ide, and imitating that true calmof the heart, which participates of the na|ture of in&s;en&s;ibility; outwardly he appears tranquil, but trouble rages within. Thus <HI>Camillus</HI> concealed his re&s;entment; <HI>Fa|bius,</HI> his thir&s;t of fame; and <HI>Decius,</HI> the love of life under love of their country. Thus the au&s;tere &s;toic, tran&s;ported with the love of glory, conceals, under an haughty indifference and di&s;dainful gra|vity, his love of plea&s;ure and aver&s;ion to pain.</P>
<P>It was not force of &s;oul that prevented <HI>Socrates</HI> from revealing his trouble and venting his tears,&mdash;it was a noble pride. After &s;o many pa&s;t efforts, he mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain his character to the la&s;t, make a virtue of a nece&s;&s;ity, and terminate victoriou&s;ly a life of perpetual conflicts.</P>
<P><Q>The whole world have their eyes up|on thee, be mindful of thy glory; thy long life has been &s;pent in making a parade of bearing adver&s;ity with firm|ne&s;s; down, down, my grief, deprive
<PB N="270" REF="278">me not at my exit from life, of the &s;ole reward of my con&s;tancy.</Q> Thus &s;aid <HI>Socrates</HI> tacitly to him&s;elf, and would have &s;poken it aloud, had he dared.</P>
<P>Let Man do his utmo&s;t, in vain will he pretend to be exempt from fear, and from the yoke of the pa&s;&s;ions; he obeys them continually without perceiving it, even at the time when he is enjoying his imaginary triumph.</P>
<P>When <HI>Diogenes</HI> crowned him&s;elf with his own hands at the <HI>I&s;thmian</HI> games, and proclaimed him&s;elf &s;uperior to plea&s;ure and every human vanity, he was the &s;lave of pride.</P>
<P>Let us then conclude, that the force of the &s;oul is a merely apparent quality, is often even nothing but weakne&s;s under the ma&s;k of &s;trength. Such is the nature of this &s;o much boa&s;ted and fallacious virtue, in which the &s;hadow is often &s;ub&s;tituted for the &s;ub&s;tance, and the appearance, for the reality.</P>
<P>Man is perpetually the &s;lave of his pa&s;|&s;ions; however, all men are not under this univer&s;al &s;ervitude in an equal degree; their &s;ubjection is greater or le&s;s in pro|portion as the pa&s;&s;ions are more or le&s;s vio|lent,
<PB N="271" REF="279">as they are in a greater or le&s;s com|bination, and as the&s;e combinations are more or le&s;s &s;trong; for the force of the &s;oul is in an inver&s;e proportion to &s;en&s;ibility. Heroes, who are celebrated for being en|dued with force of &s;oul, are more the &s;laves of their pa&s;&s;ions, than the indolent and the fickle, who are agitated by the flux and reflux of opinion, con&s;tantly waver|ing between contrary impre&s;&s;ions; their minds not having even the choice of their &s;hackles, nor the power of changing them.</P>
<P>But what is more &s;urpri&s;ing, tho&s;e &s;ages &s;o greatly renowned, and who pretend to po&s;&s;e&s;s this force of mind, are really the weake&s;t of men. During the time they believe them&s;elves &s;uperior to every pa&s;&s;ion, and are boa&s;ting of their victory, they are &s;ubject to the mo&s;t imperious ma&s;ters; for rea&s;on can never counterba|lance one &s;entiment but by its oppo&s;ite, nor re&s;train one pa&s;&s;ion but by a &s;tronger: that is, it mu&s;t free the &s;oul from one kind of &s;ervitude, by &s;ubjecting it to ano|ther yet more &s;evere.</P>
