<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FULL of Anxiety for the future Welfare of my Country, I beg Leave to call your Lord&s;hip's Attention for a Moment to the late <HI>Aero&s;tatic</HI> Di&s;coveries which at pre|&s;ent &s;o much engage the Speculation of the World. As Chief Ju&s;tice in <HI>Eyre,</HI> the Sub|ject certainly comes more immediately under your Cognizance; and, if there be no Laws exi&s;ting to limit within proper Bounds the Excur&s;ions of cele&s;tial Travellers, I make no Doubt you will lay the Matter, as early next Se&s;&s;ions as po&s;&s;ible, before Parliament, in order to determine the Legi&s;lation of the upper Regions. There is no Security now again&s;t the bold Aeronaut; he may rob us of our Daughters, and our Wives from our
<PB N="iv" REF="3">highe&s;t Windows, and &s;et the fleete&s;t Pur|&s;uers at Defiance, who are only able to fol|low him upon Terra firma. I need not in|form your Lord&s;hip that Poets are the only living Creatures, the <HI>Camelion</HI> excepted, that have any Intere&s;t, or <HI>Real Property in Air:</HI> It is well known that they have <HI>built</HI> in that Element; and, unplea&s;ing Reflection! have often been condemned to <HI>feed</HI> upon it. A|rio&s;to obtained from Apollo the Fee Simple of all that va&s;t Tract of Territory which lies between Italy and the Moon. Milton, fired with a Genius more than mortal, &s;hot up into the Heaven of Heavens! and, with Millions of flaming Cherubims at his Cha|riot Wheels, made all the Empyreal Firma|ment his own; whil&s;t Shake&s;pear, on the Wings of In&s;piration, his head crown'd with Lightning, and his Hand arm'd with Thun|der, &s;ubdued and peopled a va&s;t <HI>Aerial Con|tinent</HI> with Beings of his own wild and won|derful Creation! After the re&s;pectable Names I have ju&s;t mentioned, who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o large a <HI>Property in Air,</HI> I tru&s;t you will take the Matter into your mo&s;t &s;erious Con|&s;ideration: but do not &s;uppo&s;e, my Lord, that I am influenc'd by any &s;elfi&s;h Motives in this Addre&s;s; I &s;olemnly declare <HI>all my Property</HI> in <HI>Nubibus</HI> as yet, con&s;i&s;ts of a few <HI>temporary Booths,</HI> which I have <HI>occa&s;ionally</HI> ran up for the Accommodation of &s;ome <HI>merry Acquaintances</HI> who are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of enjoy|ing

I feel my own Want of Importance too &s;en&s;ibly to expect any Application of mine for the <HI>Security of E&s;tates in Air,</HI> can de&s;erve your Notice; but I am confident that the Names of Milton and Shake&s;pear will ever find a Patron in a Man of fine Ta&s;te and cultivated Under|&s;tanding.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, upon my &s;oul, or I &s;hould not have &s;aid it to you: the art of &s;aying civil things, Kitty, is the true art of making our&s;elves and other people happy
<PB N="10" REF="9">&mdash;I could &s;peak thus to the woman of my heart for ever&mdash;when I had exhau&s;ted my fancy in prai&s;ing her face, her per&s;on &s;hould be my theme&mdash;I'd find out new charms in her delicate hand, her fine-turn'd arm, her beauteous neck and enchanting bo&s;om;&mdash;for it has long been with me an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, that it is impo&s;&s;ible a man can &s;ay or do too many civil things for a pretty woman.</P>

<P>There's not a footman, Kitty, &s;o remarkable for keeping a &s;ecret, from Tower hill to Hyde-park-corner: my talent in that way has obtain'd me the nick-name of Guy Vaux, and the Dark Lantern.</P>

<P>But how can you be &s;ure of that?</P>

<P>Tell it me, tell it me, dear Mr. Daw&s;on.</P>

<P>Why, as I was combing his hair ye&s;terday morning, I ob&s;erv'd him take a miniature picture out of his wai&s;tcoat pocket, and look at it as if he could eat it with his eyes: judging it to be the likene&s;s of &s;ome favourite Sultana, I &s;lyly popp'd my head over his left &s;houlder, and who&s;e do you think the picture was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, how &s;hould I know?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daw.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that's not all! Going out of the room, I left the door on a jar, from a habit I have of peeping and li&s;tening to every thing that pa&s;&s;es in a family, and then did I &s;ee him &s;it as good as an hour looking at and ki&s;&s;ing the picture, for all the world as if Mi&s;s Sophia her&s;elf had been there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h from the bottom of my &s;oul it had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daw.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Mr. Mineall coming up &s;uddenly, he put the picture in his pocket again in &s;uch a hurry as if he was afraid the very light of the &s;un &s;hould &s;teal a ki&s;s from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Deuce take that Mineall, he's always &s;poiling &s;port. But how could you be &s;o ill-natur'd as to banter me in the manner you did at fir&s;t about your &s;even mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es and all &s;uch impo&s;&s;ible &s;tuff?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Merely to keep my wit in play, to give a finer edge to my &s;atirical vein. Wit, my girl, is like a &s;word; if you wou'd make the world admire the beau|ty of your blade, you mu&s;t throw away the &s;cabbard; friend or foe mu&s;t receive the wound, if you would &s;hew its point: but a ma&s;ter's hand is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;|play the high poli&s;h of your weapon, making it fla&s;h at every graceful turn, with the lightning's quickne&s;s and the diamond's brilliancy.</P>

<P>You're wrong, Kitty; you &s;hould have &s;aid, that my ma&s;ter had almo&s;t as much wit as I; for if my quantum of wit was not double my ma&s;ter's, half my poverty would have been &s;ufficient to hide it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Kitty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; for the good news you have ju&s;t told me, there's a guinea for you, <STAGE>(gives him a guinea)</STAGE> but it's all out of my own pocket; mind, I have no autho|rity from my mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daw.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath! then I can't think of taking it; <STAGE>(&s;earching his pocket as if he could not find it.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kitty. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(A&s;ide)</STAGE>
<P>Avaricious rogue! I &s;ee he won't part with it, &s;o I'll teize him a bit.&mdash;Well, if you are &s;o generous, I'll take my guinea back.</P>

<P>You provoking puppy! what do you &s;uppo&s;e I &s;ee in the blank margin of your fool's-cap counte|nance to make me put up with &s;uch in&s;olence? Have you forgot, &s;irrah, that I have treated you as my own child &s;ince you were the height of a Pope's Homer? have you forgot, you dog, that though you were brought up at Oxford, and are now a fine gentleman, that your grandfather was a Baker at Aberdeen, and never &s;aw the alphabet but upon his own gingerbread? There's your brother Sandy too; when he heard of your exploit, he mu&s;t needs have an itch for coming to England, and be damn'd to him; I &s;hall never for|get the figure he cut the fir&s;t time I &s;aw him, with his broad accent, his long Scotch face, and &s;uch a red head, that you might have lit a candle at his pole; and if I hadn't a regard for him as my &s;i&s;ter's &s;on, I'd have &s;ent him trooping back to Scotland again: I had like to have lo&s;t all my Engli&s;h cu&s;tomers by the vil|lain, for it's well known he was obliged to wear gloves the fir&s;t three months he was in the &s;hop.</P>

<P>So little value! By every hope I have of hap|pine&s;s, there is nothing upon earth &s;o truly valuable and precious to me: but how mu&s;t you interpret the addre&s;&s;es of a man with no certainty of fortune?

<P>I have already told you of his plan for breaking off my uncle's marriage with Mrs. Grampus: he is now dre&s;&s;ing up Daw&s;on, as a German Baron, and giv|ing him every nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truction for performing his part with propriety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the Baron is &s;uppo&s;ed to come from Vienna, I don't think it would be a bad hint to make him profe&s;s him&s;elf an admirer of antiquated beauty only; and in the true &s;pirit of German gallantry, look
<PB N="25" REF="24">more for wrinkles than dimples in the countenance of a mi&s;tre&s;s; I ob&s;erve that there are no characters &s;o open to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t flattery as your learned ladies, e&s;|pecially when the incen&s;e is offered them by a youth|ful Corydon.</P>

<P>It was new moon ye&s;terday; the cre&s;cent will be vi&s;ible this fine clear day about &s;ix o'clock in the evening; the general rate of balloon travelling is at about thirty miles an hour; the height of our at|mo&s;phere is ju&s;t &s;ixty miles, and the devil's in it if the moon's atmo&s;phere can be greater; the entire jour|ney, making every allowance, cannot exceed one hun|dred and twenty miles. Why not undertake it! it is no more than going to Bath; you'll perform it in four hours, and when at your journey's end, you have no more to do, but tie a rope in a &s;lip knot, chuck it up|on the horns of the moon, and dangle there but one half hour, dam'me, if you won't have half the world gazing at you.</P>

You may fir&s;t vi&s;it that mo&s;t beautiful planet, Venus; and by the mo&s;t ea&s;y tran&s;it in the world, proceed next to Mercury; I'd make intere&s;t with Jupiter to obtain his &s;atellites, by way of guards, whil&s;t I was on my travels; and if I &s;aw a convenient opportunity, I'd &s;teal Saturn's ring for the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum.</P>
