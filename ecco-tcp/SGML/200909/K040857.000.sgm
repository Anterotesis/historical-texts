<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SOME time ago I drew up a little contra&s;t between a virtuous and a vi|cious character adapted to the lower people; and intended at fir&s;t merely for the u&s;e of my own pari&s;h. It was afterwards printed for &s;ale, at the de|&s;ire of my book&s;eller;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under the title of John Trueman and Rich|ard Atkins, printed for R. Blamire, and now &s;old by Me&s;&s;rs, Cadell and Davies.</NOTE> and as it was better received than I imagined &s;uch a trifle could have been, I was in|duced to complete the plan by ano|ther
<PB N="iv" REF="5">little work of the &s;ame kind, a|dapted to the higher ranks of people; to whom I now offer it.</P>
<P>To the two fir&s;t characters, which are both <HI>fictitious,</HI> I have added two others, with a view to <HI>improve the contra&s;t,</HI> and to throw a &s;till &s;tronger light on the power of religion. The&s;e two latter characters are taken from <HI>real life.</HI></P>
<P>The former of them is extracted chiefly from a book entitled <Q>Some pa&s;&s;ages of the life, and death of John, Earl of Roche&s;ter, written by his own direction, on his death-bed, by Gilbert Burnet, bi&s;hop of Sali&s;|bury.</Q>&mdash;The
<PB N="v" REF="6"><HI>whole</HI> of the bi&s;h|op's treati&s;e, which records many things <HI>not mentioned here,</HI> is well worth the attentive peru&s;al of every one, who would &s;ee in a &s;trong light the a&s;cendancy of religion over wick|edne&s;s.&mdash;With the bi&s;hop's narrative is commonly printed a &s;ermon preach|ed at Lord Roche&s;ter's funeral, which contains many other remarkable par|ticulars. I have extracted &s;ome of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting from both.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the&s;e little memoirs is the hi&s;tory of a <HI>child of Nature</HI>&mdash;a young African prince, of the name of Naimbanna, who was &s;ent into
<PB N="vi" REF="7">England by the Sierra Leone com|pany, to be in&s;tructed in the chri&s;tian religion. The materials of this me|moir con&s;i&s;t partly of extracts from the reports of that company&mdash;and partly of particulars received from tho&s;e, who kindly took on them the in|&s;truction of this young African.</P>
<P>An apology is perhaps due for thus mixing <HI>fiction</HI> and <HI>reality</HI> in the &s;ame work. But in <HI>real</HI> characters we can|not always procure the &s;everal circum|&s;tances, and po&s;itions in life we wi&s;h to exhibit. And as to the impropri|ety of mixing them, in fact, I am in|clined
<PB N="vii" REF="8">to con&s;ider them all of the &s;ame &s;pecies. The two fir&s;t of the&s;e me|moirs do not mean to recommend them&s;elves under the idea of <HI>fiction;</HI> but as <HI>pictures drawn from the life.</HI> If indeed they had been embelli&s;hed with romantic, or unnatural circum|&s;tances, they could not certainly have united with real life. In that ca&s;e,
<Q><L>&mdash;Nec pes, nec caput uni</L>
<L>Reddatur formae.&mdash;</L></Q>But I &s;uppo&s;e there is not a &s;ingle incident in the&s;e fictions which hath not been exemplified at different times in a thou&s;and in&s;tances in real life; tho perhaps they never all met
<PB N="viii" REF="9">together in any two per&s;ons. They differ therefore, I conceive, from real life no otherwi&s;e, than as a land&s;cape compo&s;ed from &s;elected parts of va|rious countries differs from the por|trait of &s;ome real &s;cene. Both are equally copies from nature.&mdash;Nay perhaps the <HI>fictitious</HI> character is the more natural one. The deep repent|ance of Lord Roche&s;ter, and the in|genuous mind of Naimbanna, which the&s;e pages pre&s;ent, are circum&s;tances full as much, I fear, out of the com|mon road of nature, as any, which occur in the two former of the&s;e me|moirs.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF MR. WILLOUGHBY AND SIR JAMES LEIGH.</HEAD>
<PB REF="11">
<P>MR. WILLOUGHBY was the &s;on of a very worthy father, and of an excellent mother; both of whom took great pains in impre&s;&s;ing his mind with an early &s;en&s;e of religion. As he grew up, his father re&s;olved to educate him in a manner very different from the fa&s;hionable mode of educating youth. He was afraid of a public &s;chool. He was afraid al&s;o of a univer&s;ity either at home, or abroad: and &s;till more he
<PB N="2" REF="12">was afraid of foreign travel; which, in his opinion, afforded little advan|tage to an Engli&s;h gentleman.</P>
<P>He placed his &s;on therefore at an early age under the care of a neigh|bouring clergyman who had no other charge; and of who&s;e piety and learn|ing he was well a&s;&s;ured. With this worthy gentleman, young Mr. Wil|loughby pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal years with great advantage; making at different times, as his education advanced, ex|cur&s;ions for amu&s;ement, into different parts of the kingdom, &s;ometimes with his father, and &s;ometimes with his tutor.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="13">Mr. Willoughby in the mean time, was often taxed with bringing up his &s;on in &s;o reclu&s;e a manner. His reply was; he did not think our pub|lic &s;chools, and univer&s;ities, made religion &s;o much the grand point of education, as he could wi&s;h. They made human learning he thought, take the lead too much. Be&s;ides, the di&s;|&s;ipation of youth in this licentious age made him dread a connection with them. In &s;oberer times he &s;hould have been le&s;s afraid. <Q>I chu&s;e ra|ther, &s;aid he, to pur&s;ue my own method. My fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s is to make my &s;on a good chri&s;tian,
<PB N="4" REF="14">which is the foundation of every thing that is u&s;eful, and beneficial. I &s;hall then endeavour to qualify him for that &s;tation, in which Pro|vidence hath placed him.</Q></P>
<P>Accordingly, when he was about the age of eighteen, the old gentleman brought him home; and carrying him one day into his &s;tudy, he &s;eated him near his own elbow-chair; and taking him by the hand, <Q>My dear Frank, &s;aid he, I am now growing into years, and wi&s;h to di&s;incumber my&s;elf from the management of my affairs. You are now of an age to a&s;&s;i&s;t me: and there is no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which a fa|ther
<PB N="5" REF="15">can have, &s;o de&s;irable as that of a well di&s;po&s;ed &s;on. Their inte|re&s;ts are the &s;ame. Be&s;ides, added he, as you are to be bred to your fa|ther's pro&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;that of a country gentleman&mdash;while you &s;erve me, you will al&s;o be learning, if I may &s;o &s;peak, your own trade.</Q></P>
<P>Nothing could be more agreeable to young Mr. Willoughby, than the idea of being of u&s;e to his father. He only feared his own inability. With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance however of an old &s;teward, he hoped every thing would go on well. With him therefore at his elbow, he &s;ettled accounts&mdash;re|newed
<PB N="6" REF="16">lea&s;es&mdash;and ea&s;ed his father of all trouble, except that of now and then &s;igning his name. And yet he had &s;ufficient time for his books, and the indulgence of his ta&s;te in the po|lite arts, of which he was extremely fond, and in which his father greatly encouraged him as a rational amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>One thing, in which his father employed him, was to pay regularly all his little pen&s;ions to poor widows, &s;uperannuated labourers, and old &s;er|vants, of whom he had &s;everal on his li&s;t.</P>
<P>Among his own labourers, and
<PB N="7" REF="17">tho&s;e of his tenants, it was his cu&s;tom al&s;o, when the parents were de&s;erving people, to allow four guineas a year for every child above three. But when the elde&s;t went out, the fourth was con&s;idered as a third. In paying all the&s;e little pen&s;ions, which were &s;cattered about the country, Mr. Wil|loughby found no inconvenience, as he made them con&s;i&s;tent with his u&s;ual exerci&s;e on hor&s;eback. It was an employment too, in which he found much plea&s;ure, as he was every where joyfully received on &s;o kind an er|rand; and found his own happine&s;s more and more increa&s;ed, the more
<PB N="8" REF="18">he became the in&s;trument of happi|ne&s;s to others.</P>
<P>In the mean time his father carried him always with him to the &s;e&s;&s;ions&mdash;the a&s;&s;izes&mdash;and county-meetings, to initiate him by degrees into the know|ledge of &s;uch affairs, as might after|wards engage him. Thus by training him up in the bu&s;ine&s;s of a country gentleman, and the various offices of a u&s;eful life, he thought he had done more for him, than if he had &s;ent him to the be&s;t univer&s;ity in Europe. When they came home from any public meeting, the old gentleman always a&s;&s;i&s;ted his &s;on in making ob|&s;ervations
<PB N="9" REF="19">on men, and things. If he had ob&s;erved any gentleman, who had behaved with propriety, and was li&s;tened to with attention&mdash;or any, who had been loud, overbearing, and treated with neglect, he would re|mark to his &s;on the propriety, or the impropriety of every thing he had &s;een.</P>
<P>While Mr. Willoughby was thus training up an affectionate &s;on in the u&s;eful offices of life; and was about to give him more con&s;equence by &s;ettling an independence upon him, he was &s;uddenly carried off by a fit
<PB N="10" REF="20">of apoplexy, before his &s;on had yet attained his twenty-&s;econd year.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Mr. Wil|loughby lived Sir Thomas Leigh, who&s;e elde&s;t &s;on was nearly about the age of Mr. Willoughby. Sir Tho|mas was one of tho&s;e prudent parents, who blamed exceedingly the reclu&s;e manner, in which his neighbour Mr. Willoughby brought up his &s;on; and gave a very different education to his own. He thought a knowledge of the world at large was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to a gentleman of fortune. To &s;ee the tricks, and obliquity of
<PB N="11" REF="21">mankind with his own eyes, was the only way, he &s;aid, by which a young man could be taught to guard again&s;t them. Sir Thomas was what the world called a decent man. He was &s;eldom guilty of any open breach of duty; but he had no great &s;olicitude about religion; and thought accom|pli&s;hments &s;tood higher in the &s;cale of life, than chri&s;tian virtues. Under the impre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e ideas he &s;ent his &s;on to a public &s;chool, with plenty of money in his pocket to teach him the early u&s;e of it. And by the time the young man had gained a very fa&s;hionable knowledge in the art of
<PB N="12" REF="22">&s;pending it, in which few made a greater proficiency, he was &s;ent to the univer&s;ity, where he found him&s;elf in a more enlarged field for di&s;playing his abilities. Here he &s;oon became &s;o well ver&s;ed in every polite mode of expence, that his father's pocket, tho it had never been a clo&s;e one to him, began &s;eriou&s;ly to complain. Sir Thomas apprehending therefore, what indeed he might have apprehended without much &s;agacity, that Jemmy had gotten into bad company, re|&s;olved prudently to break his con|nections, before it was too late. He hurried him away therefore im|mediately
<PB N="13" REF="23">with a genteel young man, who attended him as a &s;ort of &s;ome|thing between a tutor and companion, to a foreign univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>It &s;oon however appeared, that bad company may be &s;ound abroad, as well as at home, and that young Mr. Leigh had always the addre&s;s to get acquainted with the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t con&s;ummate effort of his genius, was, to corrupt his tutor; which was a matter of great import|ance to him: for while he him&s;elf was ince&s;&s;ant in drawing bills, his tru&s;ty friend was equally a&s;&s;iduous in form|ing plau&s;ible excu&s;es. Sometimes
<PB N="14" REF="24">finding gentle fault&mdash;&s;ometimes palli|ating&mdash;and &s;ometimes hinting at the young gentleman's better re&s;olutions, he managed with &s;uch dexterity, that he kept him&s;elf free from all &s;u&s;|picion; and by that means was effect|ually enabled to a&s;&s;i&s;t his young friend in completely duping his father.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas however had now found by his banker's accounts, that he had gotten wrong a &s;econd time in his ideas of education. He called to mind therefore the old proverb, of <HI>a rolling &s;tone which gathers no mo&s;s,</HI> and determined, that Jemmy &s;ould never re&s;ide long at any one place; but
<PB N="15" REF="25">&s;ould travel from country to coun|try; and &s;o get an enlarged in&s;ight into the manners of men.</P>
<P>With this view he di&s;patched a tru&s;ty old Swi&s;s &s;ervant to accompany him in his travels, with his pocket-book &s;tuffed with recommendatory letters to all the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters at the &s;everal courts of Europe.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e orders the two friends, who were then at Rouen, &s;et out immediately for Paris. From thence they hurried away to Lyons. Turin received them next. There cro&s;&s;ing the Alps, they found them|&s;elves in Italy, which they traver&s;ed
<PB N="16" REF="26">from the Po to the bay of Naples, During all the&s;e journeys, they in|ve&s;tigated the manners of different countries in hotels&mdash;brothels&mdash;gam|ing-hou&s;es, and theatres.&mdash;At Naples their career was &s;topped. Mr. Leigh there received an account of his father's death; which was a joyful note to him, not only as he &s;ucceeded to his title and e&s;tate; but as nobody now could call him to account.</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e two young gentlemen, Mr. Willoughby, and Sir James Leigh inherited their paternal e&s;tates nearly at the &s;ame time. Mr. Wil|loughby
<PB N="17" REF="27">could &s;pend an income, clear of all incumbrances, of five thou&s;and a year. Sir James Leigh's e&s;tate, independent of his mother's &s;ettlement, brought him in more than double that &s;um. The two young gentlemen had been acquainted from their infancy; and now lived within half a dozen miles of each other; but being men of very different di&s;po|&s;itions and pur&s;uits, their intimacy, which had never been great, dwindled into a few ceremonious vi&s;its.</P>
<P>Their different di&s;po&s;itions began &s;oon to appear. Mr. Willoughby
<PB N="18" REF="28">following the &s;teps of a judicious fa|ther, was in no ha&s;te to make any alteration in his hou&s;e, grounds, or manner of living. What &s;chemes of improvement he had, he prudently con&s;idered, before he put them in execution. He thought it prudent al&s;o to lay by a little money for the&s;e purpo&s;es, left they might involve him in difficulties, from which he could not ea&s;ily free him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean time, none of his fa|ther's pen&s;ions, or charities, which were very con&s;iderable, were di&s;con|tinued. But he paid nothing with &s;o much plea&s;ure as a hundred a year,
<PB N="19" REF="29">which his father had &s;ettled for life up|on his old tutor. He would gladly have doubled it; but the old gentle|man would not &s;uffer him. <Q>Be con|tent, &s;aid he, my dear Franky, (which was his common mode of acco&s;ting him) be content with what your father has done. He was a very generous man; and if you go be|yond <HI>him,</HI> I fear you will exceed.</Q></P>
<P>While Mr. Willoughby acted this prudent part, his neighbour, Sir James, &s;et off in full career. He had &s;carce taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, when he had half the workmen of the
<PB N="20" REF="30">country about him on different pro|jects. But his favorite &s;cheme was a &s;uperb pile of &s;tabling, which he built at a va&s;t expence; and then furni&s;hed it with a great variety of the be&s;t hor&s;es, for the road&mdash;the field&mdash;the race&mdash;and the carriage. By the time his &s;tables were com|pletely filled, he had not only con|&s;umed all the ready money his father had left him, which was no incon&s;ider|able &s;um; but was obliged to make up deficiencies by borrowing &s;even thou&s;and pounds. The yearly expence of this va&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of grooms, and hor&s;es, to which he added a ken|nel
<PB N="21" REF="31">of hounds, was not &s;o little as eighteen hundred pounds.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as he dete&s;ted all thoughts of marriage, he &s;educed from her friends, a beautiful young woman, the &s;i&s;ter of a lieutenant of a man of war, who&s;e dependent &s;tate as a mi&s;|tre&s;s would free him, he hoped, from all the inconveniences, which he dreaded in a wife. But he had made a few &s;mall mi&s;takes, as mo&s;t people do, who amu&s;e them&s;elves with the&s;e licentious calculations In fact, he knew nothing of her, beyond her per&s;onal charms; nor had made any ob&s;ervations on her manners
<PB N="22" REF="32">and behaviour. Under a meek and mode&s;t demeanor &s;he concealed a very violent temper; and under an apparent &s;implicity of manners, which indicated a ductile &s;pirit, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very ob&s;tinate and re|fractory one. Her in&s;olence &s;oon began to appear; and was &s;uch, that he was daily more or le&s;s di&s;concerted by it. From the fir&s;t, it was her ob|ject to make her&s;elf the entire mi&s;tre&s;s of his family: and from le&s;s proceed|ing to more, &s;he ordered coaches, and hor&s;es, when &s;he plea&s;ed&mdash;&s;he directed his motions to different places&mdash;&s;he turned away his &s;ervants
<PB N="23" REF="33">&mdash;and even &s;ometimes affronted his company. She had the art however, when &s;he &s;aw &s;he had carried matters too far, to throw in a little &s;oothing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: and as he was fa&s;cinated with her charms, his wrath, tho daily rai&s;ed, was as often a&s;&s;waged. Every action of her life &s;hewed &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed him: but &s;he knew her pow|er; and tho &s;he delighted in teizing, and making him mi&s;erable, &s;he &s;till held him in the bonds of inchant|ment.</P>
<P>Mr. Willoughby's ideas of dome&s;|tic happine&s;s were very different.
<PB N="24" REF="34">He thought a marriage founded in virtue, mutual affection, and mutual intere&s;t, gave him a better chance for happine&s;s, than the loo&s;e indulgence of a di&s;&s;olute pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>About a mile from his hou&s;e &s;tood a good old man&s;ion, which had often been u&s;ed as a jointure-hou&s;e by the widows of the family. Here Mr. Willoughby's mother cho&s;e rather to re&s;ide, with an only daughter, than to live with her &s;on. The company he was unavoidably obliged to keep, &s;he thought might be &s;ome little intru&s;ion on the quiet of her morning and even|ing hours, which &s;he generally &s;pent
<PB N="25" REF="35">alone in her chamber, over her bible. But tho the families lived &s;eparately, the di&s;tance was &s;o &s;mall, that they were generally together.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Willoughby had an intimate friend, a young lady of her own age, of the name of Henneage, who gene|rally &s;pent a part of every &s;ummer with her. Here Mr. Willoughby, of cour&s;e, frequently &s;aw her, and as often admired her. But his behave|our was &s;o very di&s;tant, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible &s;he could take the lea&s;t notice of it. At length, when he was fully a&s;&s;ured of her good qualities, and his own re&s;olution, he ventured to open
<PB N="26" REF="36">his mind to his mother, and &s;i&s;ter. He &s;oon found he could do nothing more agreeable to them, than to pay his adder&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s Henneage. His &s;i&s;ter indeed told him, &s;he always &s;u&s;|pected he had an affection for her; <Q>Not, &s;aid &s;he, from any thing I ever ob&s;erved in your behaviour; but becau&s;e I thought it was im|po&s;&s;ible you could look with indif|ference on &s;uch excellence.</Q></P>
<P>Matters being in this train, Mr. Willoughby left it to his mother to open the affair to Mi&s;s Henneage; which &s;he did one evening as the young lady came into her chamber to
<PB N="27" REF="37">a&s;k, if &s;he had any objection to her taking a walk with Nancy to the dairy-farm? <Q>I have no objection at all, my dear Lucy, &s;aid Mrs. Wil|loughby; and now you mu&s;t tell me, whether you have any object|on to what I am going to a&s;k <HI>you.</HI></Q> On mentioning the affair, Mr. Wil|loughby's plea&s;ing form, and manly adder&s;s, and virtues, that were the theme of every tongue, came &s;uddenly ri&s;ing at once to her imagination: a &s;ort of palpitating confu&s;ion over|&s;pead her whole frame; and &s;he could an&s;wer only with a blu&s;h. She was above any coqueti&s;h airs: and the old
<PB N="28" REF="38">lady needed no other language to con|vince her, &s;he had &s;een her &s;on with as favourable eyes, as he had &s;een her. <Q>Well, my dear, &s;aid Mrs. Wil|loughby, go, and take your walk with your friend; only don't &s;tay out &s;o late, as you did la&s;t wed|ne&s;day.</Q></P>
<P>Among other things, which pa&s;&s;ed between the two friends, in their even|ing walk, on this important occa&s;ion, Mi&s;s Henneage &s;aid, it had been her &s;ecret intention, as &s;he was &s;o well provided for by her father, to lead a &s;ingle life, and &s;pend her time, and for|tune, like her good aunt, in being of
<PB N="29" REF="39">&s;ervice to her neighbours. <Q>And I believe &s;aid &s;he, nothing but &s;uch a temptation as your brother has thrown in my way, could have altered my intention.</Q></P>
<P>Matters being now &s;ettled, and Mr. Willoughby pre&s;&s;ing for an early day, &s;he &s;aid, as &s;he was not yet nineteen, &s;he could not think of changing her &s;tate of life, till at lea&s;t two years more had pa&s;&s;ed over her. To this Mr. Willoughby reluctantly con&s;ent|ed, upon condition &s;he would &s;pend that time with his mother, and &s;i&s;ter. Mi&s;s Henneage laughed, and &s;aid, &s;he did not a&s;k his con&s;ent, nor thought
<PB N="30" REF="40">her&s;elf tyed by any of his conditions. She was yet her own mi&s;tre&s;s; and intended to &s;pend the next two years with her good aunt, as &s;he had always done.</P>
<P>As her aunt lived at the di&s;tance of thirty miles, this interdict was a &s;evere trial to Mr. Willoughby. But he was obliged to &s;ubmit; and had only the &s;atisfaction of calling her a cruel, hard-hearted girl. She had the plea|&s;ure however to find, that her judici|ous young friend intirely approved her re&s;olution.</P>
<P>But tho the two years went heavily on, Mr. Willoughby had the happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="31" REF="41">at length to find, they had an end. <HI>His</HI> happine&s;s was the happine&s;s of the country. When he brought his lady home from her aunt's, the whole neighbourhood was in a tumult of joy. Among other compliments paid him on the occa&s;ion, a very ele|gant copy of ver&s;es was laid, by an unknown hand, upon his hall-table, intitled <HI>Francis and Lucy, or the happy marriage.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, Sir James Leigh was carrying on his <HI>improvements,</HI> as he called them, with a profu&s;ion of ex|pence, that a&s;toni&s;hed every body.
<PB N="32" REF="42">If you walked near his hou&s;e, you &s;aw groups of labourers, here, and there, and every where&mdash;removing ground&mdash;widening rivers&mdash;building bridges&mdash;or employed in other expen&s;ive ope|rations ; none of which had been well con&s;idered, or was conducted with the lea&s;t ta&s;te, or judgment; for he had too high an opinion of him&s;elf to fol|low the advice of any one. His pro|jects were all in oppo&s;ition to nature. He &s;eemed to delight in difficulties. If a piece of ri&s;ing ground &s;tood in his way, in&s;tead of ca&s;ting about, how to turn it into a beauty, he would immediately order it, tho of conder|able
<PB N="33" REF="43">dimen&s;ions, to be removed. Such violence is generally e&s;teemed by all judicious improvers, as ab&s;urd, as it is expen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Within doors he had a large family of ill-governed &s;ervants; who being haughtily treated, and ill-paid, had no regard for their ma&s;ter; and made no &s;cruple of paying them&s;elves by every little fraudulent exaclion; and by purloining whatever they could lay their hands upon. Every thing without doors was in the &s;ame &s;tile of prefu&s;ion. The wa&s;te and pilfering in his &s;tables, and other out-hou&s;es, was enormous.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="44">Money however now, as it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, began to grow &s;carce. Borrowing was his fir&s;t re|&s;ource. But as he had different modes of &s;pending money, it became nece&s;&s;ary to have different modes of procuring it. As one of the ea&s;ie&s;t, a friend &s;ugge&s;ted to him the method of borrowing money on annuities; and introduced him to a grave gentleman, who had always money ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t unfortunate young men. From this friend of his nece&s;&s;ity he could obtain, whenever the hour of di&s;tre&s;s came upon him, three, or four thou&s;and pounds with no more trouble than
<PB N="35" REF="45">that of &s;igning his name. Poor Sir James, who never looked beyond the pre&s;&s;ing exigence, had neither the arithmetic, nor the fore&s;ight to cal|culate how much his e&s;tate dimini&s;hed, as his wants were relieved. The cour&s;e of things however ran on, not-with&s;tanding his &s;upinene&s;s; and at the end of ten years, he found he could not &s;pend annually, out of his large e&s;tate above four thou&s;and pounds. All this however did not open his eyes. He &s;till went blindly on.</P>
<P>His prudent neighbour, in the mean time, had carryed on his im|provements
<PB N="36" REF="46">in a different manner. He went on &s;lowly; but at the end of &s;even years much was to be &s;een. His father had never &s;hewn any in&s;tances of ta&s;te; nor had he ever pretended to it. The &s;on had more refined ideas; but indulged them with great propriety. He not only kept within his abilities; but by collecting la|bourers at tho&s;e times, when other work was not ea&s;ily to be had, he made his improvements an&s;wer the double end of advantage to him&s;elf; and of convenience to his neighbours.</P>
<P>Then again by laying out his plans judiciou&s;ly at fir&s;t, he had never occa|&s;ion
<PB N="37" REF="47">to alter them afterwards. Many people &s;pend as much in altering, and undoing, as in their original work; which was poor Sir James's ca&s;e.&mdash;He had three times altered the cour&s;e of a rivulet, that ran through his park; and had as often changed the &s;ituation of a bridge. And what was &s;ingular, his &s;econd thought was generally wor&s;e than the fir&s;t; and his third, than the &s;econd. The bare alterations, had turning, the front, of a <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> co&s;t him nearly five hundred pounds. The country people gave it afterwards the name of the <HI>Temple of Folly.</HI>&mdash;Mr. Willoughby's improvements were
<PB N="38" REF="48">chargeable with none of the&s;e ill-di|ge&s;ted ab&s;urdities. What he did, was done.</P>
<P>It was one of his great rules al&s;o, never to fight with nature. Her clue guided all his operations. Where &s;he led, he followed: and thus, at the &s;ame time he formed the mo&s;t beauti|ful &s;cenes, and &s;aved more than three fourths of the expence, which his pre|cipitate neighbour would have incur|red by attempting the &s;ame thing. Every autumn he made a little addi|tion to his plan; but he meant the full completion of his de&s;ign to be the amu&s;ement of his life. He judici|ou&s;ly
<PB N="39" REF="49">con&s;idered, that when a plan is fini&s;hed, it often becomes in&s;ipid: but a growing work &s;eldom fails to be a con&s;tant &s;ource of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>That great error of &s;uffering any &s;ingle part to &s;wallow up the re&s;t, he avoided. Sir James Leigh had con|fe&s;&s;edly the grande&s;t &s;tables in the country; but they were the &s;tables of a prince, not of a country gentleman: they were far beyond the &s;cale of his hou&s;e, or any of its appendages. In Mr. Willoughby's improvements, and whole economy, you &s;aw nothing but propriety, and proportion. No gentleman made a more elegant ap|pearance&mdash;rode
<PB N="40" REF="50">a better hor&s;e&mdash;or had a more genteel equipage. If you entered his hou&s;e, you &s;aw every thing in the &s;ame &s;tile of elegance, and economy: and if you looked into his &s;tables, you &s;aw a &s;ufficient number of good, u&s;eful hor&s;es; but no &s;uper|&s;luous expence. You &s;aw neither race-hor&s;e, nor hunter. Racing he con&s;idered as gambling: and as to hunting, he thought its many di&s;a|greeable accompaniments took away from it every idea of an amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>As to his &s;ervants, many of them were a kind of heir-looms. They had lived with his father&mdash;hap known
<PB N="41" REF="51">him from a boy&mdash;and were at|tached to his intere&s;t: while every new &s;ervant readily adopted the ways of &s;o orderly a &s;ociety. Indeed his &s;ervants were generally the children of his tenants, and labourers, whom he took early into his hou&s;e; and ad|vanced as they de&s;erved. From this way of making up his family, he &s;aid, he found great advantage. He had not only his own eye upon his &s;er|vants; but the eye al&s;o of their pa|rents. In the mean time, his &s;ervice, which was indeed an <HI>inheritance,</HI> was always anxiou&s;ly &s;ought after. Such of his &s;ervants who had lived long with
<PB N="42" REF="52">him&mdash;had behaved well, as they gen|erally did&mdash;and were de&s;irous of &s;et|tling in the world, he always provided for; procuring for one a place, and giving another a farm. For their re|ception he had &s;everal little tenements &s;cattered about his e&s;tate&mdash;&s;ome of them within the precincts of his park, which he u&s;ed to call his out|po&s;ts. "It would be a difficult thing, he would &s;ay, for a tre&s;pa&s;&s;er to attack me on any &s;ide with &s;o many faithful eyes about me."</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e tenements were in &s;ight of his hou&s;e&mdash;his garden, or his park: and they were built and con|trived
<PB N="43" REF="53">in &s;uch a manner, as to adorn &s;everal little &s;cenes within his view. Some of his neighbours thought the&s;e tenements would have had a better effect, if they had been built in the form of churches and abbeys, and ca&s;tles. But Mr. Willoughby's ta&s;te was more &s;imple. He had a great di&s;like to affectation in every &s;hape; and thought the plain ornaments of nature the mo&s;t plea&s;ing decorations of a cottage. A tu&s;ted grove&mdash;a winding road&mdash;the margin of a lake&mdash;the banks of a river, or &s;ome other natural circum&s;tance, were much more
<PB N="44" REF="54">plea&s;ing to him, than tho&s;e pompous trifles, which many people admire.</P>
<P>Among &s;ervants brought up, and con&s;idered in the affectionate manner, in which Mr. Willoughby con&s;idered his &s;ervants, there was nothing of that riot, wa&s;te, and profu&s;ion, which were endle&s;s among the &s;ervants at the other hou&s;e. A careful, old hou&s;ekeeper, a butler, and a groom, who had long managed his kitchen, his cellar, and his &s;tables, &s;aw to the end of every thing. Thus altho Mr. Willoughby lived as ho&s;pitably, as generou&s;ly, and as re&s;pectably as any gentleman in the country, and had
<PB N="45" REF="55">made many improvements around him&mdash;yet by cutting off all needle&s;s expence, and by introducing &s;trict economy into &s;uch expences, as he thought needful, he not only lived within his income; but he had laid by two, or three thou&s;and pounds, as a little fund again&s;t emergencies; to which every year he added &s;omething. And if any one mentioned to him his acts of bounty, or genero&s;ity, he would &s;ay, "Do not tell me of the&s;e things. I get &s;candalou&s;ly rich, what|ever you may &s;uppo&s;e." Indeed he u&s;ed always to a&s;&s;ert that what he gave,
<PB N="46" REF="56">made him richer, in a literal &s;en&s;e, in&s;tead of poorer.</P>
<P>The great difference between Sir James Leigh's ideas of expence, and Mr. Willoughby's, was this. Sir James denied him&s;elf in nothing. Whatever fooli&s;h &s;cheme came into his head, let the price be what it might, he con&s;idered only the imme|diate gratification.&mdash;Mr. Willoughby, on the other hand. denyed him&s;elf many things, not becau&s;e he &s;hould not have taken plea&s;ure in them, but becau&s;e he thought them inadequate to the price he was to pay: that is, in &s;hort, he con&s;idered him&s;elf as the
<PB N="47" REF="57">&s;teward of heaven's bounty; and thought he &s;hould have acted as un|ju&s;tly towards his great ma&s;ter, if he had lavi&s;hed that bounty improperly, as his own &s;teward would have done, if he had embezzled his rents. <HI>Give an account of thy &s;teward&s;hip,</HI> was a regulating principle with him in all his expences.</P>
<P>If in any amu&s;ement Mr. Wil|loughby exceeded, it was in the pur|cha&s;e of pictures: and yet in this, he acted with great judgment. If a col|lector re&s;olve to purcha&s;e &s;uch pic|tures only as are curious, and capital, he may be led into any expence. But
<PB N="48" REF="58">pictures of this kind are often le&s;s prized for their excellence, than for the ma&s;ter's name, or &s;ome other cir|cum&s;tance; which has little connection with their real value. Much better pictures may be frequently bought at a lower price, tho the connoi&s;eur hath not &s;et his &s;tamp upon them. Among pictures of this &s;econd cla&s;s Mr. Willoughby made his collection. He had a good eye; and furni&s;hed his whole hou&s;e for a &s;um of money, which the curious collector &s;ometimes gives for a &s;ingle piece. And yet he was not quite &s;atisfied with his ex|pences on this head; tho it was the
<PB N="49" REF="59">only expen&s;ive amu&s;ement, in which he indulged him&s;elf. <Q>I have been looking (&s;aid he, one day to a friend) into my picture-accounts; and I find the pictures in this hou&s;e have co&s;t me the &s;hameful &s;um of one thou&s;and, five hundred, and thirty-two pounds. But my father, good man, u&s;ed to encourage me in the&s;e expences; and perhaps his encou|ragement may have carried me too far.</Q>&mdash;This &s;elf-conviction did not ari&s;e in any degree from his in|curring an expence that was incon|venient to him; but merely from the fear of having &s;pent on an amu&s;ement
<PB N="50" REF="60">what might have been &s;pent on a more proper occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Several of his apartments had been adorned in his father's time, with family-pictures. But they were &s;uch mi&s;erable repre&s;entatives cf &s;ome very re&s;pectable people, that Mr. Wil|loughby u&s;ed to &s;ay, when he looked at them, they belied every anecdote he had ever heard in their favour.</P>
<P>He did not however &s;end his family-pictures, as many do, into a garret; but hung them up in a large room, which he dedicated to the <HI>Manes of his Ance&s;tors.</HI> This room he contrived to make one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting
<PB N="51" REF="61">apartments of his hou&s;e. Tho the pictures were bad, the frames were rich; and made a &s;plendid appearance. Each portrait was numbered; and the&s;e numbers referred to a book, which lay on a table covered with green cloth, in the middle of a room. In this book he gave a mode&s;t account of all the per&s;ons, men, and women, who were a&s;&s;embled on the walls; which accounts he prefaced by &s;aying, that <Q>as many of tho&s;e per&s;ons had de&s;erved better treatment, than they had found from the hands of the arti&s;ts, who had pourtrayed them, he had endeavoured with filial piety
<PB N="52" REF="62">to his ance&s;tors, to make up the deficiency.</Q>&mdash;The following in|&s;tance will &s;hew the manner in which he drew up the&s;e &s;hort accounts.</P>

<P>This gentleman, who from the whim&s;ical manner, in which the painter has &s;urrounded him with birds, might be taken for a bird-catcher, is Mr. Willoughby, the ornithologi&s;t, &s;on of Sir Francis Willoughby, (No. VIII.) who hath ju&s;t been mentioned. At the age of thirty &s;even, at which he died, he had attained more learning, and
<PB N="53" REF="63">knowledge in various branches, e&s;pecially in natural hi&s;tory, than almo&s;t any man of his time. And what is &s;till more, he hath ever been looked up to by his grateful po&s;te|rity, as a pattern of virtue.&mdash;See his works in the library, (S. 15. 7.) and an account of him by his friend Mr. Ray, the celebrated naturali&s;t, who revi&s;ed, and publi&s;hed them. Mr. Ray in his preface to his Orni|thology, &s;ays, <HI>What rendered Mr. Willoughby mo&s;t commendable, was his eminent virtue, and goodne&s;s. I cannot &s;ay, that I ever ob&s;erved &s;uch a confluence of excellent qualities in
<PB N="54" REF="64">one per&s;on.</HI> Mr. Ray then enume|rates the &s;everal <HI>excellent qualities,</HI> which he had ob&s;erved in him.</P>
</DIV1>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>Thus Mr. Willoughby had the ingenuity to turn a number of bad pictures into a &s;et of very entertaining, companions. For as the per&s;ons they repre&s;ented, had figured in various pro&s;e&s;&s;ions of life, and many of them very reputably, he had collected from tradition, letters, and family-records, many amu&s;ing anecdotes of mo&s;t of them.</P>
<P>With three of the&s;e pictures he was a little perplexed. Two of them were by Vandyck, and the third by Sir
<PB N="55" REF="65">Peter Lely: and as all the three were good, he would have been glad to have hung them up in one of his be&s;t rooms. But on con&s;ideration, he hung all together, and graced the bad with the good.</P>
<P>Of ta&s;te, in any &s;hape, except the mo&s;t gro&s;s and &s;en&s;ual, Sir James Leigh had no idea. Of books he knew nothing. He was totally illite|rate; and in every branch of &s;cience intirely ignorant. On his intimacy with the polite arts indeed he valued him&s;elf greatly: but his knowledge of them went no further, than that kind of
<PB N="56" REF="66">in&s;ipid, in&s;ignificant prattle, which di&s;|tingui&s;hes a coxcomb. Few people therefore who had the lea&s;t preten&s;ion, either to ta&s;te, or reading, or virtue, or any thing commendable, ever came near him. The company that fre|quented his hou&s;e, were the &s;pend|thri&s;ts&mdash;the hor&s;e-racers&mdash;the game|&s;ters, and other pro&s;ligate young fel|lows of the country. Their table-conver&s;ation was commonly made up of the occurrences of the la&s;t hor&s;e|race&mdash;the la&s;t cock-fight&mdash;or the la&s;t hunting-match&mdash;perhaps at what ta|vern &s;uch a di&s;h was be&s;t dre&s;&s;ed&mdash;or where the be&s;t wine of &s;uch a kind
<PB N="57" REF="67">was &s;old. The brothel too was a common theme among them. And all this conver&s;ation was larded with oaths&mdash;prophanene&s;s&mdash;and ob&s;cenity. Loud debates too on the&s;e important &s;ubjects would often en&s;ue&mdash;many clamouring at once&mdash;while others were &s;inging filthy &s;ongs and catches&mdash;till, as the hour grew late, and bottle after bottle, had been called for&mdash;all this horrid din &s;unk by degrees into the bea&s;tly &s;tupidity of intoxication.</P>
<P>All &s;uch intemperance and irregu|larity, tho not immediately felt in a young con&s;titution, yet will &s;ap it by degrees: and Sir James found, before
<PB N="58" REF="68">he was forty, that his vicious plea&s;ures, and common modes of life, had even then begun to call him to a &s;evere account.</P>
<P>In the mean time all tho&s;e di&s;gu&s;t|ing &s;cenes, which were acted in the parlour, were acted over again in the &s;ervant's hall; where they were heightened, if po&s;&s;ible, with &s;till more abominable brutality.</P>
<P>To all this, Mr. Willloughby's fa|mily was a direct contra&s;t. He was rather a retired man him&s;elf, and not fond of company. But his &s;tation in life brought many people about him;
<PB N="59" REF="69">tho he mixed freely with tho&s;e only, who were men of approved charac|ter. With the&s;e he was always on the be&s;t terms. The clergyman of the pari&s;h, who was a religious and &s;en&s;ible man, and about his own age, was much his companion. Be&s;ides him, there were a few more men of letters in the country; with who&s;e elegant and in&s;tructive conver&s;ation he always mixed with great plea&s;ure. But when the di&s;cour&s;e did not turn on literary &s;ubjects, nothing was ever heard at his table, that was not at lea&s;t innocent, chearful, and good-hu|moured. Often it turned on modes
<PB N="60" REF="70">of ea&s;ing the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor, and of adding to their comforts. Mo&s;t of the benevolent &s;chemes, car|ried on in the pari&s;h, of which there were many, took their ri&s;e at Mr. Willoughby's table.</P>
<P>At &s;uch a board, it may ea&s;ily be imagined, no irregularity could be admitted. Mr. Willoughby him&s;elf lived with that temperance, and &s;o|briety, which all wi&s;e men would practi&s;e even on worldly motives, tho they did not con&s;ider tho&s;e virtues in the light of chri&s;tian duties. And in his company no man, if he were even inclined, dur&s;t exceed. Saints are
<PB N="61" REF="71">commonly painted with a glory round their heads. A &s;ort of &s;plendid at|mo&s;phere &s;omewhat of this kind &s;ur|rounds good men, within the influ|ence of which nothing indecent dare approach.</P>
<P>The amu&s;ements of the family were as rational as their conver&s;ation. Mr Willoughby's library was a room for u&s;e, not for &s;hew. It was adorned with globes, maps, and other &s;uitable appendages. He &s;pent much of his time among his books. Cards were never &s;een in his hou&s;e; an aver&s;ion to which he inherited from his father, who always thought them the mo&s;t in|&s;ipid
<PB N="62" REF="72">of all amu&s;ements. A game at che&s;s he would &s;ometimes play with the vicar; which was commonly a &s;harp contention between them; and often drew on more eagerne&s;s, than Mr. Willoughby liked; each having the vanity to think he was the better player.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer al&s;o bowls were much in fa&s;hion; in which Mr. Willoughby was &s;uperior to all his antagoni&s;ts. The gentlemen who commonly fre|quented his green, u&s;ed to laugh, and &s;ay, they would vote him out of all their matches; for they were &s;ure he exerci&s;ed him&s;elf with his bowls alone.
<PB N="63" REF="73">&mdash;And this indeed was true enough: for it was his u&s;ual practice, when he found him&s;elf languid at his book, to &s;tep out at a back-door in his &s;tudy, which opened near the bowling-green, and refre&s;h him&s;elf there with a little excrci&s;e.</P>
<P>But his amu&s;ements of every kind were moderate, and rational; and his &s;ervants having no examples before them, but what tended to their im|provement, fell naturally into all tho&s;e modes of quietne&s;s, regularity and ci|vility, which appeared &s;o amiable in their ma&s;ter; who&s;e endeavour they plainly &s;aw, was to make them happy,
<PB N="64" REF="74">and gratify them in every thing that was proper for them.</P>
<P>The employment, and amu&s;ements of the neighbouring family were very different. Sir James Leigh acted like a man, who thought a large for|tune had been given him merely to &s;pend in different modes of di&s;&s;ipation. Gaming was his predominant pa&s;&s;ion. Nothing ingro&s;&s;ed his thoughts &s;o much: nor was any one welcome at his hou&s;e, who was not addicted to cards, and dice.</P>
<P>Cards, and dice likewi&s;e de&s;cended into the &s;ervant's-hall, where the &s;pirit
<PB N="65" REF="75">of gaming, only in a lower &s;tile, reigned with all its a&s;&s;ociate pa&s;&s;ions, as much as in the parlour.</P>
<P>But his gaming in the country was comparatively mere <HI>amu&s;ement.</HI> In town, it was a <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> At home he played generally with his equals; and tho the practice was vile, it was &s;eldom ruinous. But when he went to Lon|don, and became a <HI>cully</HI> (as all young adventurers are) in the hands of <HI>pro|fe&s;&s;ed ma&s;ters</HI> in the art of gaming, it was dreadful indeed. And tho it would be as difficult to per&s;uade the&s;e <HI>profe&s;&s;ors</HI> to relinqui&s;h an art by which they live, as it would be to
<PB N="66" REF="76">per&s;uade their brethren of the road to lay a&s;ide their crape and pi&s;tols; yet one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e &s;o many fatal ex|amples might have &s;ome weight with the poor <HI>cullies,</HI> who are drawn into their &s;nares. They &s;hould recollect the cautious an&s;wer once given to another plunderer;
<Q><L>&mdash; Nos ve&s;tigia terrent</L>
<L>Omnia te adver&s;um &s;pectantia, nulla retror&s;um.</L></Q></P>
<P>Poor Sir James was a <HI>cully</HI> of the fir&s;t order. His &s;ervants u&s;ed to give out, they had rare doings at their hou&s;e in London. Their ma&s;ter was generally all day in bed: and their
<PB N="67" REF="77">mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;eldom at home. In|deed Sir James commonly &s;pent his nights in a gaming-hou&s;e; and retired to bed about &s;unri&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ame happine&s;s which reigned among Mr. Willoughby's <HI>&s;ervants,</HI> was diffu&s;ed among his <HI>tenants.</HI> With them he lived upon the ea&s;ie&s;t terms. When an old tenant renewed his lea&s;e, his rent was never rai&s;ed, unle&s;s &s;ome improvement in the land made the rea&s;on evident, and the tenant him&s;elf &s;aw the propriety of it. It was Mr. Willoughby's great plea&s;ure to &s;ee all his tenants thrive under him; and
<PB N="68" REF="78">to be of &s;ervice to &s;uch, as had large families, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the parents in pro|viding for them. In ca&s;es of unavoid|able misfortunes, he would often for|give rents: and in ca&s;es of le&s;s urgency he had provided a fund, from which he lent &s;mall &s;ums without intere&s;t, ei|ther to repair fume little lo&s;s&mdash;or to purcha&s;e with advantage at a good market.&mdash;When a tenant, or a la|bourer died, he had e&s;pecial regard to the widow, and family, which he con&s;idered as a tru&s;t devolved upon him&s;elf, if their circum&s;tances required it. If the widow cho&s;e to keep the farm, his &s;teward, or him&s;elf, was al|ways
<PB N="69" REF="79">ready to give his advice, or a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;Be&s;ides the&s;e open in&s;tances of kindne&s;s, he was continually doing acts of unknown genero&s;ity: and in &s;hort was con&s;idered, wherever his connections extended, as a kind of centre, which drew to it the difficul|ties, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the whole neigh|bourhood around him.</P>
<P>One indulgence he gave his tenants, which was of no &s;olid advantage in|deed, but very gratifying. He allow|ed them all to kill game upon their own farms&mdash;but he allowed this liberty only to the tenant him&s;elf, not to his &s;ervants. And he u&s;ed to &s;ay,
<PB N="70" REF="80">he believed he was a gainer by it: for the tenant thus intere&s;ted, kept off poachers, and was careful to pre&s;erve the game. Whereas, among Sir James's tenants, it was not an uncom|mon thing, when any of them found a ne&s;t of eggs in their fields, to cru&s;h them. <Q>We have no advantage, they would &s;ay, from the birds our|&s;elves, why &s;hould we &s;eed them for others&mdash;e&s;pecially for &s;uch a land|lord as ours?</Q> In the mean time, Mr. Willoughby's table was plenti|fully &s;upplied. One or other of the tenants was continually &s;ending him in the &s;ea&s;on, a hare, or a phea&s;ant,
<PB N="71" REF="81">or a couple of partridges: and when he wanted game, on any emergence, his gamekeeper could ea&s;ily get intel|ligence where to find it.</P>
<P>It was his great plea&s;ure, when he rode out, to call on one, or other of his tenants; to whom he had always &s;omething to &s;ay, that was plea&s;ing; or &s;omething to propo&s;e that was u&s;e|ful. In &s;hort, he con&s;idered them as a part of his family; and was be|loved and popular among them, be|yond what can be imagined.</P>
<P>Very different was the intercour&s;e between Sir James Leigh and his ten|ants.
<PB N="72" REF="82">Nothing plea&s;ing ever pa&s;&s;ed between them. The &s;teward, and the attorney were the only agents. Rents were rai&s;ed.&mdash;In&s;tant payments were demanded.&mdash;Misfortunes were never con&s;idered.&mdash;Seizures were made.&mdash;Guns, and dogs were taken away&mdash;Every thing was managed with har&s;h|ne&s;s. He never wi&s;hed to conciliate people by acts of kindne&s;s; but to draw them to his purpo&s;es by acts of oppre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;An hone&s;t farmer, who lived in my neighbourhood, gave me the following relation.</P>
<P>"A few years ago, &s;aid he, I rented a little farm under Sir James Leigh.
<PB N="73" REF="83">He was then very bu&s;y with his hounds: tho I believe now, poor man! that matter, as well as others, are pretty well over with him. However he then kept two packs of different kinds; and u&s;ed to put out the young hounds among his farmers, and tenants. Two of his fox-hounds were appointed for me. But as I had young children, and did not much like &s;uch company among them, I &s;ent them back to his hunt&s;man with a civil excu&s;e. I was told I &s;hould &s;uffer for it: and indeed I did. He let his fences go down in &s;ome grounds, which bordered on a large
<PB N="74" REF="84">meadow of mine&mdash;the only one, which I intended for hay. I com|plained over and over, that his cattle were continually tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing in my meadow: but I could get no redre&s;s. I am &s;ure he let his fences go down on purpo&s;e: and I lo&s;t more than ten pounds that year by the mi&s;chief, that was done me. After this, I believe, nobody dur&s;t refu&s;e his hounds.&mdash;He &s;erved another of his tenants, John Ellis, continued the farmer, the &s;ame kind of ill-natured trick. What Ellis had done to di&s;|oblige him, I forget: but I am &s;ure it mu&s;t have been &s;ome tri&s;ling thing,
<PB N="75" REF="85">for Ellis was as good tempered man as any in England. Whatever it was however Sir James took high offence, and &s;hewed his revenge by locking up a gate (over which unhappily the lea&s;e had left him a power) that led to the farmer's yard. By this piece of tyranny he obliged poor Ellis to car|ry his loaden waggons a mile and a half about."</P>
<P>Thus, in &s;hort, the landlord and tenants were always in &s;uch a &s;tate of war, and di&s;agreeable fermentation, that while Mr. Willoughby's farms were all well let; and half a dozen can|didates appeared for every one that
<PB N="76" REF="86">was vacant, Sir James had the mortifi|cation to hear, that &s;everal of his be&s;t farms were untenanted. They were of cour&s;e managed by his &s;teward and attorney, who being ill-paid, took good care to pay them&s;elves; &s;o that after the farms had pa&s;&s;ed through their hands, they produced little or nothing to the landlord. The only &s;olace he had, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, was to cur&s;e his people all round; and &s;wear he was be&s;et on all hands by a pack of rogues, and ra&s;cals; and that he did not believe there was a grain of hone&s;ty on the face of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="87">The intercour&s;e al&s;o of the&s;e two gentlemen with their trade&s;men, was as different as every other part of their conduct. Nothing could be more unpunctual than Sir James Leigh. He never &s;ent for a bill; and when it was &s;ent to him, no notice was taken of it. When the trade&s;|man complained, he was told, the bill had been mi&s;laid; and was ordered to &s;end another&mdash;or he was told, that &s;everal articles were charged in &s;o extraordinary a manner, that it would take &s;ome time to look them over. The truth was, no money could be found&mdash;e&s;pecially for &s;uch
<PB N="78" REF="88">purpo&s;es.&mdash;Sometimes indeed, when he had had a run of ill-luck at play, he was put to all his &s;hifts even to procure a few guineas. In the mean time, &s;ome of his trade&s;men would ha&s;ten payment by attorney's letters; and others would refu&s;e to &s;erve him longer.</P>
<P>All this gave him little di&s;tre&s;s. He had no regard for any thing, in which honour, or hone&s;ty, or even bare decency was concerned. He had as little for his own intere&s;t, which &s;uf|fered at all points by thus putting him&s;elf intirely into the hands of others, and di&s;abling him&s;elf from
<PB N="79" REF="89">either rectifying a mi&s;take, or guarding again&s;t a fraud. In &s;hort, if he could dexterou&s;ly evade the pre&s;&s;ing mo|ment, it was all he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mr. Willough|by's affairs were managed with the ut|mo&s;t regulariiy. He knew the con|tents of each bill, and could ea&s;ily check an improper charge.&mdash;Very exact people are often &s;olicitous to pay all their bills at the end of every week, or &s;ome other &s;hort period. But &s;uch rigid punctuality is &s;ome|times inconvenient to trade&s;men; who rather wi&s;h, when their money
<PB N="80" REF="90">is &s;afe, to let it lie, till they have occa|&s;ion to u&s;e it. Of this Mr. Wil|loughby was aware: and wi&s;hing al|ways to accomodate him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible, to the convenience of others, he de&s;ired all his trade&s;men to &s;end in their accounts, when it was mo&s;t agreeable to them&s;elves. They &s;hould be an&s;wered immediately. Only for his own convenience he de|&s;ired, that none of them might &s;tand out longer than half a year.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential difference between the&s;e two gentlemen, was in the article of religion. In Mr. Wil|loughby's
<PB N="81" REF="91">family you immediately &s;aw you were in a chri&s;tian country. That beautiful &s;implicity, and deco|rum of manners, which may be called the garb of religion, might be &s;een in every part of it: and the more you were conver&s;ant in it, the more you &s;aw of its religious deportment. Eve|ry morning and evening, the bell rang for prayers. Whether company was in the hou&s;e, or not, it made no diffe|rence. Ceremony to man was never &s;uffered to interfere with a duty to God. Religious books were often read. Bibles, and other good books were &s;een lying on parlour-windows,
<PB N="82" REF="92">and tables; and it was thought no impropriety to conver&s;e on religious &s;ubjects. Sunday was &s;trictly ob|&s;erved. Mr. Willoughby and his fa|mily, with as many of the &s;ervants, as could be &s;pared, went regularly to church&mdash;the &s;acrament was frequented&mdash;and great care was taken to keep up a religious impre&s;&s;ion among the &s;er|vants. Sunday was never a day of invitation, and company. The &s;er|vants therefore had as much re&s;pite as po&s;&s;ible from the bu&s;ine&s;s of the par|lour, the kitchen, and the &s;table.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="93">As to chri&s;tianity, in Sir James Leigh's family, it was out of the que&s;tion. There was not even the lea&s;t &s;ign of religious decorum. You could not di&s;tingui&s;h Sunday from any other day. Cards, and gaming, and drinking, were indi&s;criminately practi&s;ed. The &s;ervants followed the example of their ma&s;ter; and if any of them was better di&s;po&s;ed, and &s;hewed the lea&s;t degree of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, he was immediately laughed out of it. Sir James's hou&s;e indeed lay under &s;o bad a name, that no young per&s;ons, either men, or women, who had any regard for their characters, would live
<PB N="84" REF="94">there: &s;o that in fact, it was filled with &s;uch &s;ervants only, as nobody el&s;e would hire: nor indeed would any decent per&s;on hire a &s;ervant that had lived in &s;o di&s;reputable a family.</P>
<P>While Mr. Willoughby led the re|&s;pectable life we have &s;een in his own neighbourhood, and was beloved, wherever he was known, an event came on, which &s;hewed, he was equally re|&s;pected throughout the county. At the general election a candidate offered him&s;elf, by no means acceptable to the general &s;en&s;e of the freeholders. But as nobody oppo&s;ed him, he mu&s;t
<PB N="85" REF="95">of cour&s;e be elected. In this dilemma the gentlemen of the county, threw their eyes on Mr Willoughby, as a popular man&mdash;of good fortune&mdash;of an e&s;tabli&s;hed character&mdash;of an ancient family, long &s;eated in the county, and every way the mo&s;t likely to draw the e&s;teem of all parties, Mr. Willough|by told them he was not ambitious of &s;erving in parliament; but at all times attentive to the intere&s;ts of the county. As he thought it imprudent however to ri&s;k his fortune in a con|te&s;ted election, he hoped they would excu&s;e his &s;tipulating for &s;upport. On this head he was made perfeclly
<PB N="86" REF="96">ea&s;y; but at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ured, that if he would only declare him&s;elf, all oppo&s;ition would cea&s;e. This a&s;&s;urance was well founded. It was no &s;ooner known, that Mr. Wil|loughby offered him&s;elf, than the unanimous voice of the county ap|peared in his favour&mdash;the offen&s;ive candidate declined; and Mr. Wil|loughby was elected at the trifling expence of two hundred pounds&mdash;even which, the gentlemen of the county were de&s;irous to pay, if he would have &s;uffered them.</P>
<P>When he was in the hou&s;e, he was re&s;pected by the mini&s;ter, and often
<PB N="87" REF="97">voted with him: but he was not of his phalanx, and as often voted again&s;t him. From all favours he kept aloof; con&s;idering them as bribes, which were in &s;ome &s;hape to be repaid. This di&s;intere&s;ted conduct gave him &s;o much credit in the hou&s;e, that all the young members who had not addicted them&s;elves to party; but meant hone&s;tly to their country, thought they could not do better, than look up to Mr. Willoughby; and in all que&s;tions to follow his lead.</P>
<P>At the time when Mr. Willoughby was thus complimented by the gen|tlemen
<PB N="88" REF="98">of his county with a &s;eat in par|liament (which by the way they would never allow him afterwards to relin|qui&s;h, till age made it a burden to him) Sir James Leigh in the neigh|bouring county, received as great an affront. He was exactly in the ca&s;e of the offen&s;ive candidate, who had been antagoni&s;t to Mr. Willoughby, having obtruded him&s;elf again&s;t the inclination of all the leading gentle|men of the county, by whom he was thoroughly de&s;pi&s;ed. A warm oppo|&s;ition was immediately &s;et on foot. With his u&s;ual folly and di&s;regard to con&s;equences, he ob&s;tinately per|&s;evered;
<PB N="89" REF="99">and was at length di&s;grace|fully thrown out, after he had &s;pent, at the lowe&s;t calculation, twenty-five thou&s;and pounds.&mdash;This was a heavy &s;troke upon his affairs, already greatly in the wane. He &s;ought parliament indeed only as an a&s;ylum; or, if po&s;|&s;ible, to better his fortune: but by this un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt, he found his difficulties doubly increa&s;ed. Some of his be&s;t tenements, and farms had already been di&s;po&s;ed of, to &s;ilence his creditors, rather than to pay them. The be&s;t part of his e&s;tate was deeply mortgaged: and all his timber was cut down and &s;old.
<PB N="90" REF="100">Many thou&s;and trees were felled, which were &s;till in a growing &s;tate. In &s;hort, his extravagancies of various kinds had run him quite aground; and this la&s;t election-affair had almo&s;t compleated his ruin.</P>
<P>Another di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o happened &s;oon after the election. Sir James's mother had a &s;ettlement upon his e&s;tate of two thou&s;and pounds a year, which had never been regularly paid. But at this time, the arrears were very large. Having made many ineffectual demands, &s;he called upon him one morning; and after much heat and pa&s;&s;ion on both &s;ides, &s;he
<PB N="91" REF="101">left him with a threat to put the affair into her lawyer's hands; which &s;he did &s;oon afterwards, and obliged him to pay in one &s;um near eleven thou|&s;and pounds, which he now found it very difficult to procure.</P>
<P>More than twenty years had now elap&s;ed, &s;ince the&s;e two gentlemen had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates. Du|ring the fir&s;t &s;ix, or &s;even years, we have &s;een Sir James carrying on &s;uch immen&s;e works, as a&s;toni&s;hed every body. But they had all long &s;ince been di&s;continued. One fooli&s;h pro|ject after another, had &s;ub&s;ided. No|thing
<PB N="92" REF="102">was fini&s;hed. The whole com|pa&s;s of his intended improvements was now a &s;cene of wild, expen&s;ive de&s;olation. What he had <HI>done,</HI> and what he had <HI>undone</HI>&mdash;what he had <HI>begun,</HI> and what he had yet only <HI>plan|ned,</HI> were all blended together in one ma&s;s of confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr. Willoughby's improvements, which had gone on lei&s;urely, had now attained great per|fection. His trees were well-grown; and he had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee the plan, which he had originally formed with &s;o much judgment, now opening
<PB N="93" REF="103">more and more into &s;cenes of beauty. Every thing was in excellent order: his trees, and his &s;hrubs were healthy: his lawns and his walks perfectly neat. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee, the hand, which had executed all this elegance, was &s;till extended over it.</P>
<P>His farms too, and all the <HI>profitable</HI> parts of his e&s;tate, were in the &s;ame excellent order. While poor Sir James had not a farm hou&s;e, that was not almo&s;t in ruins, Mr. Willoughby's e&s;tate was a model of regularity, and good management. It was one of his great plea&s;ures to &s;ee his tenants under good roofs; and he thought nothing
<PB N="94" REF="104">was lo&s;t by making every thing con|venient about them. What timber he cut down, was only &s;uch as called for the axe; and in its room he planted thou&s;ands of trees all over his domains, wherever wood could po&s;&s;ibly grow with advantage&mdash;in the corners of fields particularly; which mode of planting, if it be managed properly, turns a field into a lawn.&mdash;By judicious per|&s;ons it was calculated, that by plant|ing, draining, and other improve|ments, he had increa&s;ed the value of his e&s;tate, &s;ince he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, at lea&s;t fifty thou&s;and pounds. And tho he &s;eldom rai&s;ed his old ten|ants,
<PB N="95" REF="105">yet in his new lea&s;es, tho they were always moderate, he added &s;eve|ral hundred pounds to his yearly rental.</P>
<P>The la&s;t event of Sir James's ca|reer was the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all. The woman, with whom he lived, was now become intolerable to him. In|deed &s;he had been one cau&s;e, and no incon&s;iderable one, of the ruin of his affairs. Her debts, which he had twice paid, amounted to &s;ums of con|&s;equence. Her very dre&s;s required the rental of a good farm to &s;upport. Nothing was too expen&s;ive for her.
<PB N="96" REF="106">In &s;hort, &s;he was the very genius of prodigality. Her girls al&s;o, (for &s;he had five) vyed in finery with the fir&s;t-rate mi&s;&s;es in the country: tho in the article of education, it mu&s;t be allow|ed, an intire &s;aving had been made.</P>
<P>While her youth, and beauty la&s;ted, &s;he knew how to a&s;&s;uage any tumult &s;he might have rai&s;ed; and long therefore continued to reign the intire mi&s;tre&s;s of his family. But five, and twenty years, joined to an irregular life, had now effaced her charms. Her elegant form was become heavy and bloated. Her fine complexion was grown red and pimpled. She
<PB N="97" REF="107">had lo&s;t &s;everal of her teeth: and the natural violence of her temper, hav|ing chaced away all the ro&s;y &s;miles, and dimples of youth, had taken &s;tern po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all her features. As the means of &s;oothing, therefore were gone, a continued &s;cene of quarrel, ani|mo&s;ity, and bitterne&s;s en&s;ued. What was at fir&s;t only di&s;like on one &s;ide, had now changed into a thorough di&s;|gu&s;t on both.</P>
<P>Sir James had long wi&s;hed to rid him&s;elf of this incumbrance: but &s;he had &s;uch an a&s;cendancy over him, at fir&s;t by her beauty, and afterwards by the violence of her temper, that he
<PB N="98" REF="108">never could, indeed he never dur&s;t, propo&s;e it. Wearied at length how|ever by her extravagance, and pro|voking in&s;olence, he determined, at all events, to rou&s;e him&s;elf, and throw off an evil, which was now be|yond all &s;ufferance. He told her therefore plainly, that he could keep her in his hou&s;e no longer; and that &s;he might repair to &s;uch a place (a hou&s;e of his own in a di&s;tant village) where &s;he &s;hould find he had not left her de&s;titute.</P>
<P>No mad heroine on a &s;tage, could di&s;play more fury, than &s;he did on this occa&s;ion. <Q>What! after &s;e|ducing
<PB N="99" REF="109">her, and robbing her of her innocence, did he mean to turn her out of his hou&s;e? Was &s;he, and her poor girls to go begging about the country?&mdash;No: &s;he vowed revenge. She did not &s;et her own life at a farthing in compa|ri&s;on with her revenge: and if he dared to mention &s;uch an in&s;ult to her again, &s;he would &s;hew him, what an injured, and inraged woman could do.</Q></P>
<P>Soon afterwards, her brother, the lieutenant, appeared upon the &s;tage. He entered the hou&s;e rudely; and without any ceremony, told Sir
<PB N="100" REF="110">James in a &s;urly tone, that he &s;hould find his poor injured &s;i&s;ter had a friend, who would revenge her wrongs, if he attempted to u&s;e her ill.&mdash;And to impre&s;s his menace more &s;trongly, he was often &s;een, from the parlour windows, &s;waggering about the park with his hat fiercely cocked, and a long &s;word by his &s;ide, as if he was ready to be called in on the fir&s;t &s;ummons.</P>
<P>No poor wretch was ever &s;o mi&s;e|rably harra&s;&s;ed, as Sir James. His misfortunes, (or rather his <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> for they were all of his own bringing on) had now &s;unk his &s;pirits, and
<PB N="101" REF="111">totally unmanned him. He needed not &s;uch a &s;pectre always before his windows to keep him within. Duns, and writs, and jails, were frightful ideas, and always in his thoughts. If he went to the door, he feared a bailiff in every bu&s;h.&mdash;As to the affair of the woman, he determined to make up matters as well as he could; and &s;ubmit again to that ty|ranny, which he could not throw off; tho he feared it would now be more in&s;ufferable than ever.</P>
<P>In no very &s;hort time, however he was relieved, as far as getting rid of this nui&s;ance could relieve him.
<PB N="102" REF="112">While &s;he lived with him, tho totally negligent of <HI>his</HI> affairs, &s;he had been very intent on <HI>her own:</HI> and had &s;e|cured a good pur&s;e for her&s;elf; which in the wreck of his fortune, &s;he found no very difficult matter. But when &s;he now &s;aw there was nothing more to be had, &s;he had no inclination to &s;tay longer; and took an oppor|tunity early one morning to di&s;appear, carrying the family-jewels with her, (which &s;he would never &s;uffer him to di&s;po&s;e of) and what el&s;e of value &s;he could ea&s;ily pack up. Her brother waited for her with a chai&s;e at the
<PB N="103" REF="113">park-gate; and where they went, no|body could tell.</P>
<P>The next day however Sir James received a note from her, intimating, that, <Q>As &s;he found he had lo&s;t all af|fection for her, &s;he would no longer di&s;tre&s;s him with her pre&s;ence, Nor would &s;he intrude farther on his bounty. The little things he had given her, would &s;ufficiently maintain her: only &s;he begged, he would, for her fake, take a fatherly care of the poor children &s;he had left him.</Q>&mdash;Three of them, now young women, (poor uneducated creatures) were growing up to be as
<PB N="104" REF="114">great plagues, as their mother had been. What to do with them; and what to do with him&s;elf, were matters of di&s;traction to him.</P>
<P>But the jewels were his fir&s;t con|cern. As they were very valuable, and what he had looked on as his la&s;t &s;take, he determined to pur&s;ue her with a warrant. But his attorney told him, that con&s;idering how things had been circum&s;tanced between them, and that &s;he had often been &s;een with tho&s;e jewels about her in public, he much doubted, whether he could re|cover them, even if he &s;hould be able
<PB N="105" REF="115">to find her. He was obliged therefore to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>At length, having &s;old his la&s;t un|&s;ettled acre, and collected from the wreck of his affairs, all he could, he gave his poor girls little more than was ju&s;t &s;ufficient to keep them from &s;tarving; and with the re&s;t, he en|deavoured to find a refuge abroad from the di&s;tre&s;&s;es he &s;uffered at home.</P>
<P>All the&s;e evils he had brought up|on him&s;elf, together with the total ruin of his con&s;titution, before he had attained the age of forty-&s;even. What became of him afterwards, was
<PB N="106" REF="116">never certainly known: but it was commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, he ended his days in &s;ome ob&s;cure part of Italy, or Switzerland.</P>
<P>During the &s;everal years, that Sir James Leigh was thus harra&s;&s;ed with an imperious woman, whom he dete&s;t|ed, but could not &s;hake off, Mr. Willoughby was enjoying the full happine&s;s of dome&s;tic comfort. He had married a lady every way de&s;erv|ing of him. They had but one mind between them, which was centered in making each other happy; and in dif|fu&s;ing happine&s;s, as far as they could,
<PB N="107" REF="117">around them. The fir&s;t object of their care was the education of their little family; and they had the &s;atis|faction to &s;ee them grow up with every hopeful appearance.</P>
<P>As their elde&s;t &s;on advanced to|wards manhood, the old people of the pari&s;h u&s;ed to &s;ay, he put them much in mind of what his father had been at his age. He was the &s;ame engaging youth, with his auburn hair hanging in curls about his &s;houlders&mdash;mode&s;t, civil, and obliging to every body; and mo&s;t plea&s;ed, when he had the power given him of plea&s;ing others.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="118">He married, as his father had done, early in life; and equally to the &s;atis|faction of his parents. On this event his father &s;ettled an e&s;tate of two thou&s;and a year upon him; and put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that hou&s;e, which his grandmother had formerly occu|pied.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF JOHN WILMOT, Earl of Roche&s;ter.</HEAD>
<PB N="113" REF="121">
<P>JOHN WILMOT, Earl of Ro|che&s;ter, in Charles the &s;econd's reign, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more the graces of an ele|gant per&s;on&mdash;was better bred&mdash;and was more lively and agreeable in conver&s;ation, than almo&s;t any man of his time. While his manners made him univer&s;ally engaging; his parts and knowledge introduced him to men of genius, and letters. He was fond of reading; and found one of his greate&s;t plea&s;ures to ari&s;e from in|crea&s;ing
<PB N="114" REF="122">his knowledge. His di&s;po|&s;ition too was naturally good. He was well natured, obliging to every body, and never backward in &s;erving a friend.</P>
<P>He fini&s;hed his education abroad, under the conduct of a very worthy tutor: and brought home with him a greater variety of ju&s;t ob&s;ervations on men, and things, than mo&s;t young men are able to collect</P>
<P>To his other accompli&s;hments he added the &s;plendor of military glory; having &s;erved twice with the Earl of Sandwich, as a volunteer in the Dutch war, with great reputation.&mdash;And
<PB N="115" REF="123">what gave a poli&s;h to all his accom|pli&s;hments and good qualities, was the una&s;&s;uming mode&s;ty of his behaviour. He him&s;elf was the only per&s;on who appeared uncon&s;cious of the &s;uperi|ority of his parts and knowledge.</P>
<P>Thus qualified, he was fatally in|troduced to the licentious court of Charles the &s;econd, who made him one of the gentlemen of his bedcham|ber, and ranger of Wood&s;tock park.</P>
<P>The life of a courtier gave a new turn to his ideas. He became the idol of all the gay, the profligate, and unprin|cipled young people, with whom that court abounded. His manners were
<PB N="116" REF="124">&s;o engaging, and his wit, and humour &s;o entertaining, e&s;pecially when a little inlivened with wine, that he was continually be&s;et by tho&s;e, who watched every opportunity of enjoying his company.</P>
<P>Tho Lord Roche&s;ter had a ta&s;te for literature, he &s;oon al&s;o felt a ta&s;te for plea&s;ure, which in the end de&s;troyed every principle of virtue.&mdash;In the early part of his life he had a reli&s;h only for the company of men of genius, &s;en&s;e, and learning. But court man|ners rendered him le&s;s nice. He was frequently obliged to mix with trifling, illiterate, and vicious people: and
<PB N="117" REF="125">finding he could unbend him&s;elf among them, and be perfectly at his ea&s;e; he began to find a reli&s;h in their company; and by degrees to like no other company &s;o well.</P>
<P>Thus entered among profligate people, he &s;oon became eminent. As he was &s;uperior to all his compa|nions in wit and genius, he &s;oon out|did them all likewi&s;e in every kind of depravity. He gave a loo&s;e to his appetites, and courted plea&s;ure in every form. During five years of his life, he confe&s;&s;ed, he was hardly ever in &s;uch a &s;tate as could be called perfectly &s;ober; and in this time was guilty of a
<PB N="118" REF="126">thou&s;and &s;trange extravagancies. He would go about the country in various &s;hapes, &s;eldom without &s;ome profli|gate intention&mdash;chiefly in pur&s;uit of &s;ome low amour. But whatever cha|racter he a&s;&s;umed&mdash;a farmer&mdash;a &s;ailor&mdash;a razor-grinder&mdash;a beggar&mdash;or any other&mdash;he acted his part in every di&s;|gui&s;e, &s;o incomparably well, that if he had met even an intimate friend, as he frequently did, he would pa&s;s undi&s;|covered; and would afterwards tell his friend &s;ome circum&s;tances of his life, which the other thought he only could have known by witchcra&s;t. Once being obliged to keep out of the way,
<PB N="119" REF="127">he became a mountebank on Tower|hill; and was enough acquainted with phy&s;ic, to delude the populace into an opinion of his wonderful abilities. In this profe&s;&s;ion, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, he could have made a very comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, if he had wi&s;hed it.</P>
<P>Nor was he more abandoned to the indulgence of his appetites, than loo&s;e to every principle of common hone&s;ty. Plea&s;ure was his only pur&s;uit. This led him into expence. Expence pro|duced nece&s;&s;ity; and nece&s;&s;ity, di&s;ho|ne&s;ty. Profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip to tho&s;e whom he mortally hated, and intended, if he could, to ruin&mdash;un|meaning
<PB N="120" REF="128">oaths and vows in his ad|dre&s;&s;es to women&mdash;tricks put upon trade&s;men, and creditors, to deceive, and cheat them, with a variety of other di&s;hone&s;t practices, were com|mon with him. In &s;hort, no man ever gave him&s;elf up to plea&s;ure with more eagerne&s;s&mdash;was le&s;t re&s;trained by principle in the pur&s;uit of it&mdash;was better qualified to procure it&mdash;or had a higher reli&s;h for the enjoyment of it when procured.</P>
<P>But one great ob&s;tacle &s;till obtruded it&s;elf on the&s;e joyous pur&s;uits. Tho he had not principle enough to re|&s;train his actions, he had enough to
<PB N="121" REF="129">alarm his con&s;cience. Mere morality he was able to manage pretty well; were it not for its inconvenient con|nection with religion. It was nece&s;|&s;ary for him therefore to rea&s;on down all the trouble&s;ome reflections, which aro&s;e on this &s;ubject; and with this view he had gotten together all the common-place arguments he could invent, or collect&mdash;many of them ta|ken up from tho&s;e, whom on any other &s;ubject he would have de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a mind &s;o full of intelligence as his was, could ea&s;ily be dive&s;ted of every idea of re|ligion. The being of a God he al|lowed.
<PB N="122" REF="130">He &s;aid, he never could con|ceive the world to be made by chance; the productions and regula|rity of nature, proclaimed beyond contradiction an infinite power. But then he wi&s;hed to infer from various circum&s;tances, which he did not care to examine deeply, that this power had little concern with the affairs of men. He could not, he &s;aid, attribute hu|man pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;hate, or love&mdash;to a per|fect being. That would be to form a Deity on heathen theology: and therefore, where there was neither love nor hatred, he could not &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="131">there could be either reward, or pu|ni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Then again he thought, that to love God, was pre&s;umptuous&mdash;to fear him, &s;uper&s;titious. Prayer he thought could be of no u&s;e, as it was not to be imagined the Deity was &s;o weak, as to be wrought on by the im|portunities of man. All religious wor&s;hip therefore, except, as he would &s;ay, in a gay humour, a few hymns in celebration of the divine maje&s;ty, he &s;uppo&s;ed to be u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Two maxims in morality he con|fe&s;&s;ed he could not but hold, however little he had lived up to them.&mdash;That
<PB N="124" REF="132">we &s;hould do nothing to injure ano|ther; nor any thing to prejudice our|&s;elves&mdash;particularly our own health: but that the gratification of our appetites, when it did not interfere with either of the&s;e points, he endeavoured to per&s;uade him&s;elf was very lawful. It was unrea&s;onable he thought to &s;up|po&s;e they were put into man, merely to be re&s;trained.</P>
<P>It was his favourite doctrine, that &s;elf-intere&s;t governed the world; and that it was right it &s;hould do &s;o. What was general benevolence, he would a&s;k, but putting one man's hap|pine&s;s in the power of another?
<PB N="125" REF="133">Whereas, if every man took care of him&s;elf, the bu&s;ine&s;s was in &s;afer hands, and the end would be better an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Still however the doctrine of a fu|ture &s;tate recurred, notwith&s;tanding all his endeavours to &s;tifle it; and was more in his way than any thing el&s;e; as he could not believe the &s;oul would be di&s;&s;olved by death. What might become of it, he could not pretend to &s;ay: but &s;till he per&s;uaded him&s;elf the doctrine of rewards and puni&s;hments was not included in its immortality. That doctrine, he wi&s;hed to believe, was big with ab&s;urdity. Heaven ap|peared
<PB N="126" REF="134">to him too good for the be&s;t; and hell too bad for the wor&s;t. And indeed he conceived, if God was the good Being he was repre&s;ented, he could not, con&s;i&s;tently with that good|ne&s;s, make any of his creatures mi&s;e|rable.</P>
<P>Thus he had formed a &s;ort of re|ligion for him&s;elf which he had con|trived to an&s;wer an unprincipled life. As for the religion of the bible, he found it of too rigid a texture to mold into any commodious form. He was obliged therefore to &s;trike the bible entirely out of his &s;cheme. In order to this, like other infidels, he would
<PB N="127" REF="135">li&s;ten to no <HI>evidence</HI> in its favour; but thought every <HI>objection,</HI> tho he might have found it an&s;wered over and over, highly worth his attention.</P>
<P>As for the in&s;piration of the &s;crip|tures, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, he knew not what it meant. He could not conceive, how God &s;hould reveal his &s;ecrets to men. Nor indeed could he &s;ee any occa&s;ion for revealed religion at all, as he had no idea of man's having been ever placed in a better &s;tate than he was in at pre&s;ent. And even if a revelation had been nece&s;&s;ary, one &s;hould have thought it would have been more exten&s;ive; and have taken
<PB N="128" REF="136">place long before the time of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar.&mdash;As to prophecies, and mi|racles, the world had ever been full of &s;uch wonderful &s;tories&mdash;and he &s;up|po&s;ed they all depended intirely on the credulity and folly of mankind.&mdash;The &s;criptures, he thought, carried on their very face the marks of impo|&s;ition: the &s;tile and manner of writing&mdash;the various contradictions, which he found in them&mdash;the di&s;order in point of time&mdash;and many other things, he owned, had &s;ufficient weight with him to de&s;troy their credibility.&mdash;Be|&s;ides, he &s;aid if a man <HI>could not believe,</HI> which was his ca&s;e, faith could neither
<PB N="129" REF="137">be <HI>forced</HI> upon him, nor <HI>required</HI>&mdash;and the my&s;teries of &s;cripture, &s;uch as the trinity&mdash;the incarnation&mdash;the atonement, and &s;ome others, were to him wholly incomprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>But of all things, he plumed his in|fidelity mo&s;t upon the bad lives of the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity. As the clergyman, he &s;aid, had &s;tudied reli|gion, he mu&s;t of cour&s;e be be&s;t acquainted with the evidences of it: and if the&s;e evidences had no effect on him, it was &s;hrewdly to be &s;u&s;pected, there was no weight in them. When he &s;aw clergymen therefore at court, u&s;ing &s;o many mean arts, as he
<PB N="130" REF="138">often did, in obtaining preferment, he could not &s;uppo&s;e, they conceived better of the chri&s;tian religion, than he him&s;elf did.</P>
<P>Thus we have taken a &s;hort view of the abandoned life of this uncom|monly wicked profligate. We have &s;een the pleas he made u&s;e of to cover his vices; and the arguments he u&s;ed with him&s;elf, &s;uch as they were, to &s;trengthen his infidelity. His whole life indeed was only a &s;truggle again&s;t conviction: for a man of his &s;en&s;e could not avoid perceiving that when he deba&s;ed religion, he put a force
<PB N="131" REF="139">upon nature.&mdash;Let us now &s;ee the end of all this: and how it concluded at length in the triumph of religion.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this noble profligate enjoyed his health, and met with no checks from nature in the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, all was well. His mind was occupied in a thou&s;and plea&s;ureable engage|ments&mdash;reflection was turned a&s;ide&mdash;and his con&s;cience in a great degree &s;ilenced.&mdash;But vicious enjoyments have &s;eldom an extended date. Be|fore he had attained his thirtieth year, Lord Roche&s;ter had out-run his con|&s;titution and found every acce&s;s of plea&s;ure to be an acce&s;s al&s;o of di&s;|ea&s;e.
<PB N="132" REF="140">He was now worn down to a &s;hadow; and con&s;umptive &s;ymptoms were increa&s;ing daily upon him. But what threatened the mo&s;t immediate danger, was an ulcer, which his phy|&s;icians thought was forming in his bladder. As it gave him however no great unea&s;ine&s;s, he hoped it might di&s;per&s;e without any fatal effects. And indeed he found him&s;elf after|wards &s;o well, that having occa&s;ion to vi&s;it his e&s;tate in Somer&s;et&s;hire, he undertook the journey with his u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity, and rode po&s;t. But the heat, and violence of the exerci&s;e &s;o in|flamed the ulcer, which might proba|bly
<PB N="133" REF="141">with care and quietne&s;s, have di&s;|per&s;ed, that he was obliged to return in his coach to Wood&s;tock-lodge, very much out of order.</P>
<P>God affords all &s;inners <HI>opportunities of reflection</HI>&mdash;&s;ome circum&s;tances in each man's life, which, if they were as properly accepted, as they are graci|ou&s;ly intended, would lead him to repentance. Some men are drawn by cords of love. But &s;evere calamities only can bring others to reflection. When they feel the world failing under them; and its be&s;t promi&s;es ending in deceit, if they are not hard|ened
<PB N="134" REF="142">beyond all reflection, they natu|rally look round for &s;omething that can admini&s;ter comfort.</P>
<P>This was the ca&s;e of the Earl of Roche&s;er. He had lived a plea&s;ure|able, and a vicious life, The plea|&s;ure was now gone, the remembrance of the wickedne&s;s alone was left. It &s;hocked him to think he had given up his health, his fortune, his friends, his character&mdash;every thing in this world that was valuable, for what he now only remembered with horror.</P>
<P>But this was &s;o far mere worldly compunction. It led however to more &s;erious reflection.&mdash;As this
<PB N="135" REF="143">world &s;ailed, the next drew nearer: and as he always had &s;ome conception of a future &s;tate, tho he wi&s;hed not to &s;uppo&s;e it a &s;tate of retribution, his active mind could not help being anxious for better information. He knew he had never examined into the&s;e matters with any attention him|&s;elf; and therefore could not but doubt his own crude rea&s;onings, which never could amount to more than mere conjecture. His friends there|fore, particularly his mother, the Counte&s;s Dowager of Roche&s;ter, en|deavoured to get &s;erious people about him; hoping they might put thoughts
<PB N="136" REF="144">into his mind, which his own active &s;pirit would ea&s;ily pur&s;ue.&mdash;Among the&s;e, the chief were Mr. Par&s;ons, her chaplain&mdash;and Dr. Burnet, afterwards bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury. One or other of the&s;e was frequently with him, and by degrees he took plea&s;are in their conver&s;ation. To Dr. Burnet he &s;hewed a particular attachment; and de&s;ired him, on his death-bed, to give the world an account of the conver|&s;ations that pa&s;&s;ed between them. "I have done much mi&s;chief, &s;aid he, in my life-time; I &s;hould wi&s;h to make &s;ome amends for it at my death."
<PB N="137" REF="145">To the&s;e two gentlemen Lord Ro|che&s;ter laid open, without &s;cruple, all the vile opinions he had held in the early part of his life. He never, he &s;aid, was &s;atisfied with them. He al|ways felt &s;trong remor&s;e of con&s;cience; tho too often, he feared it was found|ed on his having ruined him&s;elf in this world. Yet &s;ometimes he believ|ed, the di&s;quietude of his mind had a better principle. <Q>I remember once, &s;aid he, at the hou&s;e of a per&s;on of quality, where &s;everal of us pro|phane young fellows had met toge|ther, I undertook the cau&s;e of athei&s;m: and I was thought to have
<PB N="138" REF="146">performed my part &s;o well, that I was overwhelmed with applau&s;e. But as I left the company, I felt my&s;elf exceedingly &s;hocked at what had pa&s;&s;ed; and could not help breaking out into &s;ome &s;uch &s;olilo|quy as this&mdash;Good Heavens! that a man, who walks upright&mdash;who &s;ees around him the wonderful works of God&mdash;and has the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es and rea&s;on&mdash;could ever abu&s;e them in &s;o horridly prophane a manner!</Q> Indeed, he would &s;ay, in the wor&s;t part of his life, he never could, with all his rea&s;oning, per&s;uade him&s;elf into athei&s;m. He was &s;ome|thing
<PB N="139" REF="147">like the devils: he <HI>believed and trembled.</HI></P>
<P>At other times he would confe&s;s, that notwith&s;tanding his own licenti|ous actions, he always felt a &s;ecret value for an hone&s;t man; and always thought morality &s;at well on others. But he owned he had never felt any reverence for the go&s;pel&mdash;nor had ever taken that pains in &s;eeking into its evidence, which a matter of that <HI>apparent</HI> importance required.&mdash;The fir&s;t thing, he told Dr. Burnet, which made him think &s;eriou&s;ly of chri&s;tianity, was a conver&s;ation he had with Mr. Par&s;ons; who &s;peaking of
<PB N="140" REF="148">prophecy, pointed out to him the fifty-third chapter of I&s;aiah; and &s;hewed him how exactly the &s;ufferings of our Saviour de&s;cribed there, agreed with the account given of them by the evangeli&s;ts; tho it is certain the book of I&s;aiah was written many ages before our Saviour lived, and is e&s;teemed by the Jews at this day to be divinely in&s;pired. This compari&s;on &s;o intirely &s;atisfied his under&s;tanding, that the pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour he &s;aid, appeared as clear and plain to to him, as any object he ever &s;aw re|pre&s;ented in a gla&s;s. The original, and the image were exactly alike.&mdash;This
<PB N="141" REF="149">pa&s;&s;age from I&s;aiah he got by heart, and frequently &s;oothed him&s;elf by re|peating it.</P>
<P>And here let us pau&s;e a moment. As God affords all &s;inners <HI>opportuni|ties of reflection,</HI> &s;o does he likewi&s;e afford them various <HI>means of conver|&s;ion,</HI> according to their various di&s;po|&s;itions, and different modes of think|ing. One man is &s;truck with the wonderful works of God. The imagination of another fa&s;tens on &s;ome beautiful analogy of nature. A third is awakened by &s;ome pious life he has read&mdash;or &s;ome &s;ermon he has
<PB N="142" REF="150">heard&mdash;or conver&s;ation that has &s;truck him. A fourth is affected by the &s;im|plicity, and purity of &s;criptural pre|cepts, or examples. From one or other of the&s;e &s;ources, or &s;omething el&s;e perhaps in the divine economy, which forcibly &s;trikes his mind, the &s;in|ner will often through the grace of God a&s;&s;i&s;ting his pious endeavours, take the beginning of a new life.&mdash;Lord Ro|che&s;ter we have &s;een, was fir&s;t brought to a &s;en&s;e of religion by the wonder|ful coincidence between the prophe|cies and the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Having thus gained as it were, a glimp&s;e of chri&s;tianity, his intuitive
<PB N="143" REF="151">mind ea&s;ily proceeded. From &s;im|ply contemplating the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, he began to inquire into the cau&s;e of tho&s;e &s;ufferings. He &s;aw in a &s;trong light his own wicked life, and the heinou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in; and devoutly acknowledged the nece&s;&s;ity of a Redeemer. <Q>O ble&s;&s;ed God! he would cry, can &s;uch a creature as I have been, gain acceptance from thee! Can there be any mercy for me! Will God own &s;uch a wretch!&mdash;Never, never, he would add, but through the infinite merits of a Re|deemer&mdash;never, but by the pur|cha&s;e of his blood.</Q>&mdash;Then again,
<PB N="144" REF="152">a &s;en&s;e of his own guilt &s;lowing in &s;trongly upon him, he would cry out, (&s;triking his hands together) he had been the vile&s;t dog, the &s;un ever &s;hone upon: and thought the life of a &s;tarving leper, crawling in a ditch, as he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, more enviable than a life like his.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, his whole frame being thus intirely changed, he carried into religion all tho&s;e &s;trong feelings, and warm pa&s;&s;ions, which had led him &s;o violently a&s;tray in the paths of vice.</P>
<P>In a calmer interval, he would &s;peak of the fooli&s;h, and ab&s;urd phi|lo&s;ophy of the late Mr. Hobbes, and
<PB N="145" REF="153">others of that &s;tamp. "Aye, he would cry, the&s;e were my ruin. The&s;e phi|lo&s;ophers helped to undo me."</P>
<P>Then laying his hand on the bible, he would &s;ay, "<HI>There</HI> is true philo|&s;ophy.&mdash;This is the wi&s;dom that &s;peaks to the heart. A <HI>bad life,</HI> is the only grand objection to this book. And it is &s;urely a bad way in examin|ing the truth of it, to <HI>begin with ca|villing.</HI> Let us examine fir&s;t the <HI>evidence</HI> and <HI>tendency</HI> of it, and try whether that will not blunt the edge of many <HI>objections.</HI>"</P>
<P>In &s;hort, chri&s;tianity had taken &s;uch full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind, that
<PB N="146" REF="154">altho he had been at fir&s;t awakened from his criminal life by dreadful ap|prehen&s;ions, and horrors, his conver&s;i|on was now founded on a firm belief of the go&s;pel; his mind became daily more calm; and he prayed to God with all earne&s;tne&s;s for his grace and holy &s;pirit to a&s;&s;il&s;t him in keeping &s;teady to the re&s;olutions he had form|ed.&mdash;In his devotions, he would &s;ometimes u&s;e his own prayers; which Mr. Par&s;ons, who was often with him at prayer, u&s;ed to &s;ay, were truly excellent.</P>
<P>As his heart &s;eemed thus changed,
<PB N="147" REF="155">the habits of his life were changed with it,</P>
<P>He was very &s;olicitous to have all his debts paid; many of which he had contracted without any de&s;ign of pay|ing them at all.</P>
<P>Acts of re&s;titution al&s;o he ordered, when re&s;titution was in his power. When it was not, he prayed to God earne&s;tly to forgive him, and merci|fully to accept a &s;incere intention.</P>
<P>The thoughts of his corrupt wri|tings gave him great di&s;tre&s;s. They could not be recalled: but he hoped, that whoever heard of them, would hear al&s;o of; the di&s;tre&s;s they had given
<PB N="148" REF="156">him. Such of his writings however, as were unpubli&s;hed&mdash;all his la&s;civious pictures&mdash;and every thing el&s;e that had a bad tendency, he &s;trictly order|ed his executors to burn.</P>
<P>Injuries which he had received him&s;elf, many of them great, and pro|voking, he declared in the pre&s;ence of God, he forgave from his heart; and was ready to do any act of kindne&s;s in his power, to tho&s;e who had offended him.</P>
<P>He had formerly indulged &s;uch a habit of &s;wearing, that oaths made a part of his common conver&s;ation: and when he was heated, they were
<PB N="149" REF="157">frightful. But he had now &s;o wholly ma&s;tered this vile habit, that bi&s;hop Burnet tells us, when fits of pain came upon him, which were frequent, and violent, he never heard any thing like an oath e&s;cape him. On one oc|ca&s;ion indeed, when he was &s;urffering under an acute paroxy&s;m of his di&s;or|der, and had &s;ent a &s;ervant for &s;ome|thing, which he thought he might have brought &s;ooner, he cried out, "That d&mdash;d fellow I &s;uppo&s;e is lo&s;t." When the bi&s;hop remarked it, he &s;aid, <Q>Aye, you &s;ee how this lan|guage of fiends &s;till hangs about me&mdash;Who de&s;erves d&mdash;g &s;o much as
<PB N="150" REF="158">my&s;elf?&mdash;God forgive me!</Q>&mdash;Ex|cept on this occa&s;ion, the bi&s;hop ob|&s;erves, he never heard even a ha&s;ty expre&s;&s;ion come from him. To his &s;ervants indeed, during his whole ill|ne&s;s, he was kind, con&s;iderate, and even affectionate; giving them as little trouble as he could help; and apolo|gizing for every extraordinary trouble he was obliged to put upon them. &mdash;His regard for them he &s;till &s;hewed more effectually in his will.</P>
<P>Among his other faults, he had &s;hewn much unkindne&s;s to his rela|tions. He had paid little re&s;pect to his mother&mdash;he had neglected his Lady;
<PB N="151" REF="159">and been inattentive to his children. His behaviour in all the&s;e in&s;tances, was now wholly changed. To his mother it was re&s;pectful in the greate&s;t degree&mdash;to his Lady, tender and af|fectionate. She was a very amiable woman; and having been recovered from the church of Rome, in which &s;he had been brought up, it gave him, he &s;aid, un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction to re|ceive the holy &s;acrament with her, from the hands of a prote&s;tant clergy|man.&mdash;Her gentle attention to him in his illne&s;s, which was unwearied, filled him with the tendere&s;t remor&s;e, and a thou&s;and namele&s;s &s;en&s;ibilities.&mdash;For
<PB N="152" REF="160">his children's happine&s;s he &s;eemed highly concerned. He had a &s;on, and three daughters; and would often call them to him, and &s;peak to them in &s;o affecting a manner, as no words but his own, could expre&s;s. Once as the bi&s;hop was &s;itting by him, when his children were with him, he cried out, "See how good, God has been to me in giving me &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings&mdash; What an ungracious dog have I been!"</P>
<P>On another occa&s;ion, &s;peaking of the great concern he was under for their pious education, he earne&s;tly hoped his &s;on would never be a wit&mdash;
<PB N="153" REF="161">that is, &s;aid he, one of tho&s;e wretched beings, who pride them&s;elves in &s;coff|ing at God, and religion. An hone&s;t and religious man, he added, is a cha|racter, beyond any thing fortune, and honours have to give. He then ble&s;&s;ed them, and prayed for them; and committed them to the protection of God.</P>
<P>It was a favourite topic with him, whenever he had opportunity, to &s;et him&s;elf up as a melancholy example to deter others from a bad life.&mdash;A gentlemen of &s;ome quality called, one day to &s;ee him. <Q>Aye, look at me, &s;aid Lord Roche&s;ter, and &s;ee what
<PB N="154" REF="162">a man is reduced to, who has &s;pent his life in &s;coffing at God, and religion. You and I, my good friend, have been old &s;inners toge|ther; and therefore I am the more free with you. I hope you will &s;ee your wickedne&s;s, as I have &s;een mine. Depend upon it, my friend, we have been mi&s;taken in our con|ceits. Our opinions are ill-found|ed. Therefore may God grant you repentance!</Q></P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Burnet al&s;o tells us, that Lord Roche&s;ter gave it to him in charge, a little before his death, to tell a certain per&s;on from him, for who&s;e
<PB N="155" REF="163">welfare he was much concerned; that altho there were nothing to come, after this life; yet all the plea&s;ures he had ever known in &s;in, would have been ill bought with half the torture he had felt on the recollection of them.</P>
<P>Thus this noble Lord had done much in a little time. His &s;ins had been great: his repentance was &s;evere: and, as his hours &s;hortened, he became perfectly compo&s;ed; and expre&s;&s;ed a willingne&s;s, and even a wi&s;h to die. He hoped he &s;hould never relap&s;e, if God &s;hould grant him a longer life: but he thought he could never expect
<PB N="156" REF="164">to be in a better &s;tate to die, than he was in at that time. <Q>And indeed, &s;ays bi&s;hop Burnet, I had every rea&s;on to believe him perfectly &s;in|cere. I remember, continues the bi&s;hop, after his having had many &s;leeple&s;s nights, a do&s;e of laudanum was admini&s;tered to him without his knowledge. The effect of it was a mo&s;t refre&s;hing &s;leep. In the morning he found him&s;elf &s;o per|fectly well, that he thought his di&s;|order was now come to a cri&s;is; and that nothing ailed him, but weak|ne&s;s, which he &s;uppo&s;ed would in a little time go off. As he was fully
<PB N="157" REF="165">po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this idea, he enter|tained me with the &s;cheme of his future life. He would retire from the world, he &s;aid, and &s;pend the remainder of his days, in &s;tudy, in|nocence, and piety.</Q> And the bi&s;hop had no doubt but he was &s;in|cere; and that if he had lived, he would have put all this in execution. The joys of religion &s;eemed to have taken &s;o much hold of him, that it was not likely he would ever again have given them up for the plea&s;ures of &s;in.</P>
<P>But this relaxation from pain was &s;oon over. When the refre&s;hment of
<PB N="158" REF="166">the night went off, it left him in the &s;ame &s;tate in which it found him. Two days longer he langui&s;hed.&mdash; But nature was now entirely exhau&s;ted. The di&s;charge from the ulcer was &s;o great, that his whole body was in a manner, con&s;umed. He was frequent|ly al&s;o in violent pain: and from lying &s;o long in one po&s;ture, the depre&s;&s;ed parts began to mortify. Notwith|&s;tanding however all this di&s;tre&s;s, his compo&s;ure, and re&s;ignation were won|derful. He &s;poke little&mdash;was heard to pray &s;ervently; and on the 26th of July, 1680, in the thirty-third year of his age, he died at Wood&s;tock-park
<PB N="159" REF="167">in Oxford&s;hire.&mdash;About a month be|fore he died, he dictated the following paper, which he &s;igned with his own hand; and had it regularly atte&s;ted.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>"For the benefit of all tho&s;e, whom I may have drawn into &s;in by my ex|ample, and encouragement, I leave to the world this my la&s;t declaration, which I deliver in the pre&s;ence of the great God, who knows the &s;ecrets of all hearts, and before whom I am now ap|pearing to be judged&mdash;that from the bottom of my &s;oul, I dete&s;t and abhor the whole cour&s;e of my former wicked life; and that I think I can never &s;ufficiently

</LETTER>
<P>Such was the life of this very ex|traordinary man. It re&s;olves it&s;elf into three di&s;tinct periods&mdash;each, in its way equally wonderful. In the fir&s;t, he appeared in the polite world, as the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed gentleman
<PB N="162" REF="170">of his time. In the &s;econd, he be|came the mo&s;t abandoned profligate: and in the la&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;incere peni|tent.</P>
<P>What a happy man might he have been, if he could have kept his de|&s;ires within the bounds of virtue, and have added religion to the ble&s;&s;ings he enjoyed! He had every thing that the world could give: but gra&s;ping at plea&s;ure in exce&s;s, he found it mi&s;ery. A harra&s;&s;ed mind, and a di&s;|ea&s;ed body were the fruits of his vici|ous plea&s;ures&mdash;the lo&s;s of every worldly enjoyment&mdash;and at a period,
<PB N="163" REF="171">when life is in its prime, the decrepi|tude of age.</P>
<P>He had the wi&s;dom however at la&s;t to turn his &s;ufferings to account; and &s;ee his errors, before it was too late. But what remor&s;e, horror, and an|gui&s;h did it co&s;t him, before he arriv|ed at that peaceful &s;erenity, which he might with innocence have enjoyed to a late period of life.</P>
<P>Some are inclined, through zeal for the honour of God, to take from the force of the&s;e extraordinary conver|&s;ions, by &s;uppo&s;ing, that God arbitra|rily vouch&s;afes a peculiar influx of
<PB N="164" REF="172">his grace to one man, which he denies to another&mdash;that we have nothing there|fore to do in the work of &s;uch conver|&s;ions our&s;elves: they are the entire work of God; and the greater the &s;in|ner the more abundant often is the grace.</P>
<P>No doubt, it is a doctrine of &s;crip|ture, that all our goodne&s;s is derived from God: but it is the doctrine of &s;cripture al&s;o that our own endeav|ours mu&s;t co-operate with God's goodne&s;s, and make his grace effectu|al. When we are told that <HI>God worketh in us both to will, and to do of his good plea&s;ure;</HI> that is, through his good plea&s;ure that he worketh in
<PB N="165" REF="173">us at all; we are told al&s;o, that <HI>we are to work out our own &s;alvation with fear and trembling.</HI> Every opinion there|fore, however well-meant, which has a <HI>tendency</HI> to check our own pious endeavours; and to lay the <HI>whole work,</HI> if I may &s;o &s;peak, on God, ap|pears to be equally un&s;criptural, and mi&s;chievous.</P>
<P>St. Paul's ca&s;e is mentioned, and that of the thief on the cro&s;s, as in|&s;tances of &s;udden, and peculiar effu|&s;ions of grace. But neither of them &s;eems to be a ca&s;e in point. St. Paul was a man of great piety. His di&s;po&s;ition was always good; and his
<PB N="166" REF="174">practice agreeable to what he thought the will of God. He was only under a violent prejudice, which it plea&s;ed God to remove by an <HI>open miracle.</HI></P>
<P>As to the thief on the cro&s;s, we may &s;uppo&s;e he had then the fir&s;t <HI>religious opportunity</HI> he had ever had&mdash;and that the &s;ight of his &s;uffering Saviour wrought in him at once a full con|viction. The hi&s;tory does not give us the lea&s;t ground for more, or to be|lieve he received any <HI>peculiar</HI> interfe|rence of grace, which was denied to his companion.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we are <HI>not</HI> told in what <HI>manner</HI> the grace of God co-operates with man. But we <HI>are</HI> told, that
<PB N="167" REF="175">God is <HI>no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons:</HI> and every part of &s;cripture injoins us the practice of a holy life founded on our faith in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Others again, who are le&s;s concern|ed about religion, would take from the force of &s;uch conver&s;ions, as this of Lord Roche&s;ter, by attributing them to a melancholy oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits; or by re&s;olving them into en|thu&s;ia&s;m or &s;uper&s;tition. But why &s;hould any of the&s;e cau&s;es be a&s;&s;igned to Lord Roche&s;ter's conver&s;ion? Does it appear from the hi&s;tory of his life that he was under any oppre&s;&s;i|on
<PB N="168" REF="176">of &s;pirits&mdash;that he was under any fear, but what was the effect of guilt&mdash;which is the very medium of every conver&s;ion; and which all wicked men mu&s;t feel, before they can be brought to a &s;en&s;e of their wickedne&s;s?&mdash;Does it appear, that there was any thing enthu&s;ia&s;tic, or &s;uper&s;titious in his ideas of chri&s;tianity? and particu|larly, in his declaration at his death?&mdash;or in &s;hort, does it appear that he held any opinion, which all &s;ober chri&s;tians do not, at all times hold? If &s;o; why &s;hould we attribute to a bad cau&s;e, what has the faire&s;t preten&s;ions to the be&s;t?</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="177">Be&s;ides, all who were about Lord Roche&s;ter at the time of his death, &s;peak of his faculties as perfectly lucid, and equal to what they had ever been. Bi&s;hop Burnet perhaps takes more than ordinary pains to wipe off any &s;uppo&s;ition, that at the time of his death, he was under any particular weakne&s;s of imagination; and &s;peaks of the great vivacity of his di&s;cour&s;e, which was equal at that time, to what he had ever ob&s;erved in the days of his mo&s;t perfect health.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF NAIMBANNA, A Young African Prince.</HEAD>
<PB N="173" REF="179">
<P>WHEN the Sierra Leone com|pany were fir&s;t &s;ettled, they endeav|oured to bring over to their friend&s;hip all the petty African princes in their neighbourhood. Among others, they applied to a chief, of the name of Naimbanna, who was remarkable for a good di&s;po&s;ition, and an acute un|der&s;tanding. He ea&s;ily &s;aw the in|tention of the company was friendly to Africa, and entered into amity with them.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="180">They &s;poke to him about the &s;lave-trade, and gave him rea&s;ons for wi&s;h|ing to have it aboli&s;hed. He was convinced of its vilene&s;s; and de|clared, that not one of his &s;ubjects &s;hould ever go into &s;lavery again.</P>
<P>By degrees they began to talk to him about religion. But he was ra|ther wary on that head. It &s;eems he had received a prejudice again&s;t chri&s;tianity, from the following cir|cum&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Portugueze had, at that time, &s;everal mi&s;&s;ionaries about the country, who under the pretence of preaching chri&s;tianity, &s;old charms to the na|tives;
<PB N="175" REF="181">and in exchange received ivory, gold du&s;t, and other commodities for the merchants, by whom they were employed. Among their converts, was one of Naimbanna's chief friends; who had afterwards many conver&s;a|tions with Naimbanna on the &s;ubject of religion; and endeavoured to make a convert of him al&s;o. He told Naimbanna, that the chri&s;tian re|ligion was the be&s;t religion in the world; for a man could do no|thing &s;o bad, which the prie&s;ts of that religion would not forgive for a mere trifle. Naimbanna with great acutene&s;s of mind, told him,
<PB N="176" REF="182">he thought a good religion would never &s;uffer that; and refu&s;ed to be a chri&s;tian. On talking therefore with the gentlemen of the factory, on this &s;ubject, and finding they pro|fe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tianity, as well as the Portugueze mi&s;&s;ionaries, he conclud|ed their tenets were the &s;ame, and paid little attention to them.</P>
<P>By degrees however he found, that the factory contained a very good &s;ort of people&mdash;that they lived happily among them&s;elves, and did not &s;ell pardons for gold du&s;t as the Portu|gueze did. He began therefore to think more favourably both of them and their religion.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="183">But tho it appears he had a much ju&s;ter opinion of chri&s;tianity, than he had received from the Portugueze mi&s;&s;ionaries; yet he was &s;till back|ward either in receiving it him&s;elf, or in making it the religion of his country. He was well convinced of the barbarous &s;tate of his own people, on a compari&s;on with Europeans, and wi&s;hed for nothing more than a refor|mation among them&mdash;e&s;pecially in re|ligion. But as he found there were &s;everal kinds of religion in the world, he wi&s;hed to know which was the be&s;t, before he introduced any.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="184">To a&s;certain this point as well as he could, he took the following method. He &s;ent one of his &s;ons into Turkey, among the Mahometans&mdash;a &s;econd in|to Portugal, among the papi&s;ts; &s;up|po&s;ing probably that the mi&s;&s;ionaries did not teach their religion properly&mdash;and a third he recommended to the Sierra Leone company, de&s;iring they would &s;end him into England, to be there in&s;tructed in the religion of the country. By the report of his &s;ons, it appears, he meant to be directed in the choice of a national religion.</P>
<P>Of the two former of the&s;e young men we have no particulars; only
<PB N="179" REF="185">that one of them became very vicious. It is the la&s;t mentioned, tho, I believe, the elde&s;t, who bore his father's name, Naimbanna, to whom this account be|longs. The Sierra Leone company received the charge of him with great plea&s;ure, believing that nothing could have a better effect in promoting their benevolent &s;chemes, than mak|ing him a good chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Young Naimbanna was a perfect African in his form. He was black, had woolly hair, thick lips, and that blunt &s;ingularity of feature, with which the African face is commonly marked. While he was with the
<PB N="180" REF="186">company, he &s;eemed a well-di&s;po&s;ed, tractable youth; but when oppo&s;ed, impatient, fierce, and &s;ubject to vio|lent pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;hip that &s;ailed, he was &s;ent to England, where he arrived in the year 1791. We may imagine with what a&s;toni&s;hment he &s;urveyed every object that came before him: but his curio&s;ity in prudent hands became from the fir&s;t, the medium of u&s;eful in&s;truction.</P>
<P>During his voyage he had picked up a little of the Engli&s;h language; to which he was not a perfect &s;tranger when he embarked. He had gotten
<PB N="181" REF="187">hold of &s;everal words and phra&s;es; and tho he could not &s;peak it with any degree of fluency, he could under|&s;tand much of what he heard &s;poken; which greatly facilitated his learning it, when he came to it in a more re|gular way.</P>
<P>The difficulty of learning to &s;peak, and read, being in a great degree &s;ub|dued, he was put upon the grand point, for which he was &s;ent into England&mdash;that of being in&s;tructed in the chri&s;tian religion. The gentle|men to who&s;e care he had been recom|mended, alternately took him under their protection; and each gave up
<PB N="182" REF="188">his whole time to him, faithfully di&s;|charging the tru&s;t he had voluntarily, and without any emolument under|taken.</P>
<P>Naimbanna was fir&s;t convinced that the bible was the word of God; the mo&s;t material parts of which&mdash;of the old te&s;tament, as well as of the new&mdash;were explained to him. The great nece&s;&s;ity of a Saviour from the &s;inful|ne&s;s of man was pointed out&mdash;the end and de&s;ign of chri&s;tianity&mdash;its doctrines&mdash;its precepts, and its &s;anctions, were all made intelligible to him. With a clearne&s;s of under&s;tanding, which a&s;toni&s;hed tho&s;e who took the
<PB N="183" REF="189">care of in&s;tructing him, he made the&s;e divine truths familiar to him: and having no prejudices to oppo&s;e, but the ab&s;urdities of his own country, which were ea&s;ily &s;ubdued, he re|ceived the go&s;pel with joy; and car|ried it home to his heart as the means of happine&s;s both in this world and the next.</P>
<P>His love for reading the &s;criptures, and hearing them ready, was &s;uch, that he was never tired of the exerci&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. H. More, who knew him well, in|formed the author, that altho &s;he never &s;aw Naim|banna fatigued with this exerci&s;e, he had often fa|tigued her with reading the &s;cripture at his de&s;ire ince&s;&s;antly to him.</NOTE>
<PB N="184" REF="190">Every other part of learning that he was put upon, as arithmetic for in|&s;tance, was heavy work with him; and he &s;oon began to complain of fatigue: but even when he was mo&s;t fatigued, if he was a&s;ked to read in the bible, he was always ready; and generally expre&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s by &s;ome emo|tions of joy. In &s;hort, he con&s;idered the bible as the rule which was to di|rect his life; and he made a real u&s;e of every piece of in&s;truction he ob|tained from it. This was evident in all his actions. If his behaviour was at any time wrong, and a pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture was &s;hewn to him, which
<PB N="185" REF="191">forbad the impropriety or wrong be|haviour, whatever it was, he in&s;tantly complied with the rule he received. Of this there were many in&s;tances.</P>
<P>One related to dre&s;s. He had a little touch of vanity about him&mdash;was fond of finery&mdash;admired it in other people, and was always ready to adorn him&s;elf. His kind in&s;tructors told him the&s;e were childi&s;h inclinations&mdash;that decency, and propriety of dre&s;s were plea&s;ing: but that foppery was di&s;gu&s;ting. Above all, they told him the &s;cripture idea was very different. The chri&s;tian was ordered to be <HI>cloath|ed with humility;</HI> and to put on the
<PB N="186" REF="192">ornament of a <HI>meek and quiet &s;pirit.</HI> Such pa&s;&s;ages, whenever they were &s;ugge&s;ted to him, checked all the little vanities of his heart; and made him a&s;hamed of what he had ju&s;t before &s;o eagerly de&s;ired.</P>
<P>The irritable pa&s;&s;ions, where lay his weake&s;t &s;ide, were conquered in the &s;ame way. His friends once car|ried him to the hou&s;e of commons to hear a debate on the &s;lave trade; which colonel Tarlton defended with &s;ome warmth. When Naimbanna came out of the hou&s;e, he exclaimed with great vehemence and indignation, that he would kill that man where|ever
<PB N="187" REF="193">he met him; for he told &s;tories of his country. He told people that his countrymen would not work; and that was a great &s;tory. His country|men would work; but Engli&s;hmcn would not buy work; they would buy only men.&mdash;His friends told him, he &s;hould not be &s;o angry with colonel Tarlton; for perhaps he had been mi&s;informed, and knew no better. Be&s;ides they told him, that at any rate, he had no right to kill him; for God &s;ays, <HI>Vengeance is mine, I will repay, faith the Lord.</HI> This calmed him in a moment: and he never after|wards expre&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t indignation
<PB N="188" REF="194">at colonel Tarlton; but would have been ready to have &s;hewn him any friendly office, if it had fallen in his way.</P>
<P>At another time, when he &s;aw a drayman u&s;ing his hor&s;e ill; he fired at it exceedingly; and declared in a vio|lent pa&s;&s;ion, he would get a gun, and &s;hoot that fellow directly. He would always, he &s;aid, carry a gun about him to kill &s;uch &s;ort of people, for they de&s;erved to be killed. But his anger was pre&s;ently a&s;&s;waged, by &s;ome &s;uch pa&s;&s;age from &s;cripture, as, <HI>Be ye angry and &s;in not: let not the &s;un go down up|on your wrath.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="195">Among the difficulties, in which his new religion involved him, one re&s;pected his wives. He had married three; but he clearly &s;aw the new te&s;ta|ment allowed only one. What &s;hould he do with the other two? Then again, if he &s;hould repudiate two of them, which &s;hould he retain? In ju&s;tice he thought he &s;hould keep her, whom he had married fir&s;t. But &s;he was not the wife of his affections. He loved the &s;econd be&s;t. In &s;hort, he &s;hewed &s;o much tenderne&s;s of con|&s;cience on this, and every other point, that he &s;eemed anxious about nothing, but <HI>to know what his religion required
<PB N="190" REF="196">him to do.</HI> When be could determine the <HI>rectitude</HI> of an action, he &s;et an example to chri&s;tians, by &s;hewing he thought there was no difficulty in the <HI>performance.</HI> Whether he met with any ca&s;ui&s;t, to &s;et him right in the matter of his wives, I never heard. It is certain however, that while he con|tinued in England, he &s;hewed no &s;ign, in any in&s;tance, of infidelity to his African engagements.</P>
<P>With regard to liquor, which is a great temptation to an African, he was, from the fir&s;t, perfectly &s;ober. He &s;aid, his father had ordered him never to drink more at a time than a
<PB N="191" REF="197">&s;ingle gla&s;s of wine, when he came in|to England; and he con&s;idered his fa|ther's injunction as &s;acred. It was probably founded on the knowledge of his &s;on's warmth of temper, which he &s;eared wine might inflame. On this head therefore all the in&s;truction he wanted, was to turn his temperance into a chri&s;tian virtue, by practi&s;ing it with a &s;incere de&s;ire to plea&s;e God.</P>
<P>Among the gay &s;cenes, which Na|imbanna could not but often &s;ee, he never mixed. His friends were very &s;olicitous to keep him from all plea&s;u|rable di&s;&s;ipation, which might po&s;&s;ibly have corrupted that beautiful &s;impli|city
<PB N="192" REF="198">of mind, which was &s;o characte|ri&s;tic in him: tho indeed he never &s;hewed a de&s;ire to join in any diver|&s;ion, which they did not intirely ap|prove. Dancing a&s;&s;emblies were the only meetings of amu&s;ement, for which he &s;hewed the lea&s;t inclination. But tho his friends were unwilling to tru&s;t him in any gay, promi&s;cuous meetings of that kind, they were very ready to indulge him in a dance at home.; and he enjoyed the exerci&s;e with great alacrity, jumping and ca|pering, after the manner of his coun|try, with an agility, which was too violent for any body but him&s;elf.&mdash;
<PB N="193" REF="199">He was fond al&s;o of riding on hor&s;e|back; but when he got upon a hor&s;e, there was no governing his de&s;ire of rapid motion.</P>
<P>He had now been a year and a half in England, and had been well in|&s;tructed in the chri&s;tian religion, which he perfectly under&s;tood. He was baptized therefore; and now on|ly waited for the fir&s;t opportunity of going home, which did not happen till about five or fix months after|wards.</P>
<P>In the mean time two great points were the burthen of his thoughts, and
<PB N="194" REF="200">gave him much di&s;tre&s;s. The fir&s;t related to his father, who&s;e death, he had heard, had happened about a year after he left the country. The great cau&s;e of his &s;olicitude was his uncertainty, whether his father had died a chri&s;tian. He knew he had been well-di&s;po&s;ed to chri&s;tianity: but he had never heard, whether he had fully embraced it.</P>
<P>His other difficulty regarded him|&s;elf. He had now attained the end he aimed at. He had been in&s;tructed in a religion, which, he was convinced, would promote the happine&s;s of his people, if it could be e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="195" REF="201">among them. But how was that to be done? With regard to him&s;elf, he had had wi&s;e, and learned men to in|&s;truct him. But what could his abili|ties do in &s;uch a work?&mdash;e&s;pecially con&s;idering the wild, and &s;avage man|ners of his countrymen. In every light, the greatne&s;s of the attempt perplexed him.</P>
<P>With a mind di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the&s;e dif|ficulties, he took an affectionate leave of his kind friends in England, and embarked for Africa in one of the company's &s;hips, which was named after him, the Naimbanna.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="202">On the departure of this amiable youth, we cannot help &s;ympathizing with his generous feelings on the &s;tate of his country, which all humane peo|ple mu&s;t unite in deploring. Much do we admire the Sierra Leone com|pany for their beneficent endeavours to re&s;cue it from that mi&s;erable &s;tate of darkne&s;s, in which it is involved. But nothing perhaps places its wretched bondage in a more &s;triking light, than &s;uch a character as we have ju&s;t been exhibiting. When we were taught to believe the African had &s;carce a rank among human beings, it injured our feelings le&s;s to think of
<PB N="197" REF="203">the ba&s;e condition to which he was reduced. But when we &s;ee in him &s;uch in&s;tances of fine affections&mdash;&s;uch generous &s;entiments&mdash;&s;uch aptitude to receive religious truth&mdash;and have every rea&s;on to believe, that in&s;tances of this kind are to be found, more or le&s;s, in all parts of this unhappy country;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That a real, and general conver&s;ion of the negroes is no romantic project, but a thing per|fectly practicable; and that it would be highly beneficial both to the &s;laves, and their proprietors, is evident from the progre&s;s already made in this work by the Moravian mi&s;&s;ionaries. In the Dani&s;h i&s;lands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, they have pro&s;elyted near 6,000 negroes. They have al&s;o a congregation of &s;everal thou&s;ands in the i&s;land of Antigua; and I have been a&s;&s;ured by a gentlemen of credit, who &s;aw them at public wor&s;hip, that their deportment was remarkably &s;erious, devout, amd edifying.

<P><PB N="199" REF="205">We le&s;t Naimbanna embarking for Africa, in a &s;tate of mind rather tending to de&s;pondency. He had too much &s;en&s;ibility about him to enjoy any &s;ettled repo&s;e. Tho he had al|ways &s;hewn great affection for his own country, and relations, yet the kind|ne&s;&s;es he had received from his friends in England had impre&s;&s;ed him
<PB N="200" REF="206">&s;trongly; and it was not without a great &s;truggle with him&s;elf that he broke away from them at la&s;t.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;s he felt was the greater, as the &s;ociety he now mixed in at &s;ea was very different from that he had left behind. The profligate manners, and licentious language of the &s;hip's company, &s;hocked him ex|ceedingly. The purity of his mind could not bear it. He hoped in a chri&s;tian country, he &s;hould always have found him&s;elf among chri&s;tians. But he was greatly di&s;appointed. The company he was in, appeared to him as ignorant; and uninformed as
<PB N="201" REF="207">his own &s;avage countrymen; and much le&s;s innocent in their manners. At length, the oaths, and abominable conver&s;ation he continually heard, di&s;gu&s;ted him &s;o much, that he com|plained to the captain of the &s;hip, and de&s;ired him to put a &s;top to &s;uch in|decent language. The captain en|deavoured to check it; but with little effect; which gave Naimbanna new di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But what &s;till more than all was the great burden of his mind, was the difficulty he fore&s;aw in his attempt to introduce chri&s;tianity among his countrymen. Many were the &s;chemes
<PB N="202" REF="208">he thought of. But in&s;uperable ob&s;tacles &s;eemed to ari&s;e on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>All this perplexity, which his active, and generous mind underwent, recoil|ed upon him&s;elf. His thoughts were continually on the &s;tretch; and, as it was thought, at length occa&s;ioned a fever, which &s;eized him, as his voyage was nearly at an end. His malady in|crea&s;ing, was attended with a delirium, which le&s;t him only few lucid inter|vals. In the&s;e his mind always &s;hone out full of religious hope, and patient re&s;ignation to the will of God.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="209">During one of the&s;e intervals he told Mr. Graham, (a fellow-pa&s;&s;enger, with whom he was mo&s;t intimate) that he began to think he &s;hould be called away, before he had an opportunity to tell his mother of the mercies of God towards him, and of his obligati|ons to the Sierra Leone company. He then de&s;ired him to take pen and ink, and write his will. The will, as follows was written in the pre&s;ence of captain Wooles, and of James Cato, a black &s;ervant, who attended Naim|banna. It was afterwards regretted, that Mr. Graham had not written the will exactly in the language, which
<PB N="204" REF="210">Naimbanna dictated, in&s;tead of giving it a legal ca&s;t.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>On board the Naimbanna, July <HI>14, 1793.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I, Henry Granville Naimbanna, having been, for &s;ome days, very un|well, and being apprehen&s;ive, that I may not reach my friends, have commu|nicated the underwritten, in the pre|&s;ence of the &s;ub&s;cribers.&mdash;It is my will, and de&s;ire, that my brother Bartholo|mew do pay to the Sierra Leone com|pany thirteen tons of rice, or the value thereof, being in con&s;ideration of the &s;ums expended by the &s;aid company on
<PB N="205" REF="211">my account.&mdash;And likewi&s;e, that my &s;aid brother &s;hall pay the &s;um of fifty pounds &s;terling to Henry Thornton, E&s;q. for money advanced by him on my ac|count.&mdash;It is my will al&s;o, that my bro|ther Bartholomew &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s all my e&s;tates, real, and per&s;onal, till my &s;on Lewis &s;hall be of age; and that he &s;hall deliver unto my &s;aid &s;on, all that he re|ceives from me for him; and that he will always endeavour to be on a good under&s;tanding with the Sierra Leone company. I particularly reque&s;t him, as far as he can, to oppo&s;e the &s;lave trade; and that nothing injurious may be impnted to the Sierra Leone company
<PB N="206" REF="212">by any evil-minded men, who&s;e intere&s;t may be to oppo&s;e that worthy company. &mdash;I here declare in the pre&s;ence of that God, in whom I place my tru&s;t, that du|ring my &s;tay in England, I always en|joyed very good health; and received the greate&s;t kindne&s;s from all tho&s;e, who&s;e care I was under; and that, at my leaving England, I was in perfect health.&mdash;It is likewi&s;e my reque&s;t, that my brother &s;hall &s;end to the Suzee coun|try for the cows, that belonged to my fa|ther; and that he will pre&s;ent three of them to the governor and council of the Sierra Leone company. And if he does not find that number of cows, that he
<PB N="207" REF="213">will purcha&s;e three others, and give them in my name.&mdash;I farther de&s;ire, that my brother will pay James Dean Cato, who attended me as my &s;ervant, the &s;um of five bars.&mdash;</P>
</LETTER>
<P>When Mr. Graham had written thus far, Naimbanna complained of fatigue; and &s;aid, he would fini&s;h his will after he had taken a little re&s;t. But &s;oon after, his fever came on with increa&s;ed violence, and his delirium &s;carce ever left him afterwards.</P>
<P>In this will, we &s;ee the workings of his generous mind, which &s;eems chiefly to have been intent on two
<PB N="208" REF="214">things&mdash;the remuneration of his friends (tho they would not accept his kind legacies) and the prevention of any mi&s;chief befalling the company from his dying in their hands. It is probable, if he had fini&s;hed his will, he would have added other legacies; for &s;everal Engli&s;h gentlemen were kind to him, as well as Mr. Thorn|ton.</P>
<P>The night after Naimbanna had made his will, the ve&s;&s;el, tho clo&s;e on the African coa&s;t, dur&s;t not attempt to land, as the wind was contrary, and there was danger of running on the Scarries bank. The next morning
<PB N="209" REF="215">however, tho the wind was &s;till con|trary, Mr. Graham went off to the &s;ettlement in an open boat, to procure medical aid. But when the phy&s;ician came on board, the poor youth was only ju&s;t alive: and in that &s;tate he was carried to the &s;ettlement the next morning, July the 17th, when the &s;hip came to an anchor.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t account of Naimbanna's illne&s;s, an expre&s;s had been &s;ent to inform his friends at Robanna: and &s;oon after he landed, his mother, bro|thers, &s;i&s;ter, and other relations came to the &s;ettlement. His wives it is
<PB N="210" REF="216">probable, lived in &s;ome di&s;tant part, as they are not mentioned. The di&s;|tracted looks of his mother, and the wildne&s;s of his &s;i&s;ter's grief affected every one. His cou&s;in Henry, an inge|nuous youth, who &s;tood among them, attracted the attention of all by the &s;o|lemn &s;orrow of his countenance, which &s;eemed to di&s;cover a heart full of ten|derne&s;s and woe. His brother Bar|tholomew was the only one, who ap|peared little concerned, and gave much offence to the gentlemen of the factory, by the indifference of his behaviour.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="217">In the mean time, the dying youth appeared every moment drawing near|er the clo&s;e of life. His voice failing more and more, the little he &s;aid, was with difficulty under&s;tood. Once, or twice, tho&s;e around him caught hold of &s;omething like our Saviour's words, <HI>Many are called, but few are cho&s;en.</HI></P>
<P>About an hour before he died, his voice wholly failed. He was awhile re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y; till turning his head on his pillow, he found an ea&s;ier po&s;ture, and lay perfectly quiet. About &s;even o'clock in the evening of the &s;ame day, on which he was
<PB N="212" REF="218">brought on &s;hore, he expired without a groan.</P>
<P>When his mother and other rela|tions found his breath was gone, their &s;hrieks, and agonizing cries were di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing beyond mea&s;ure. In&s;tantly, in a kind of frantic madne&s;s, they &s;natched up his body, hurried it into a canoe, and went off with it to Robanna.</P>
<P>Some of the gentlemen of the factory immediately followed in boats with a co&s;&s;in. When the corp&s;e was laid decently into it, Mr. Horne, the clergyman, read the funeral &s;ervice ever it, amid&s;t a number of people;
<PB N="213" REF="219">and fini&s;hed with an extempore prayer. The ceremony was conducted with &s;o much &s;olemnity, and performed in &s;o affecting a manner, that the impre&s;&s;ion was communicated through the whole ignorant croud. They drew clo&s;er and clo&s;er, as Mr. Horne continued to &s;peak; and tho they under&s;tood not a &s;yllable of what he &s;aid, they li&s;tened to him with great attention; and bore witne&s;s, with every mark of &s;orrow, to the powers of &s;ympathy.&mdash;After the ceremony was over, the gentlemen of the factory retired to their boats, leav|ing the corp&s;e, as his friends de&s;ired, to
<PB N="214" REF="220">be buried after the manner of the country.&mdash;We mix our grief with theirs; and &s;hut up in the in&s;crutable coun&s;els of God, all inquiries into the rea&s;ons why &s;o invaluable life was per|mitted to be cut off, ju&s;t at the time of its greate&s;t probable utility.</P>
<P>In his pocket-book were &s;ound-after his death, two litle notes, which &s;hew the wonderful &s;en&s;ibility of his mind in religious matters. They re|late to a cirum&s;tance already taken notice of&mdash;the di&s;gu&s;t he took at the behaviour of the &s;hip's company.
<PB N="215" REF="221">The fir&s;t &s;eems to have been written &s;oon after he embarked.</P>
<P><HI>I &s;hall take care of this company which I now fallen into, for they &s;wears good deal, and talks all manner of wickedne&s;s, and filthy. All the&s;e things can I be able to re&s;i&s;t this temptation? No, I cannot, but the Lord will deliver me.</HI></P>
<P>The other memorandum was pro|bably written after he had complained to the captain.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 23, 1793.&mdash;<HI>I have this day declared, that if Sierra Leone's ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be like to Naimbanna, or have a company like her, I will never think of
<PB N="216" REF="222">coming to England again, tho I have friends there as dear to me as the la&s;t: words my father &s;poke, when he gave up the gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It was not however without rea&s;on, that Naimbanna, who knew his coun|trymen, had been &s;o &s;olicitous in his will, to &s;ettle the &s;tate of his health, when he left England. Tho the peo|ple appeared plea&s;ed at fir&s;t with the attention, which the company had &s;hewn to their young prince; yet a rumour &s;oon began to &s;pread, and, gain credit among them, that he had been poi&s;oned by the captain of the
<PB N="217" REF="223">&s;hip; and a &s;pirit was ri&s;ing in the country, in &s;ome degree fomented, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, by Naimbanna's brother Bartholomew, which &s;eemed to fore|bode di&s;agreeable con&s;equences. The company had occa&s;ion for all their addre&s;s to &s;atisfy the people, and bring them to a right under&s;tanding of the ca&s;e; which however they at length with great prudence effected.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FROM THE WHOLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE ob&s;ervations which &s;eem naturally to ari&s;e from the&s;e &s;everal little hi&s;tories, are the&s;e.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t exemplify&mdash;that if a man of fortune would live mo&s;t at his ea&s;e, he mu&s;t live <HI>within</HI> his income&mdash;that a moderate and temperate u&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ings, which God hath intru&s;t|ed to him, affords as much happine&s;s,
<PB N="219" REF="225">as tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings can produce&mdash;much more than a licentious abu&s;e of them &mdash;that his enjoyments are in fact multiplied by di&s;tributing from his overplus to tho&s;e in need&mdash;that this can only be done by economy, and the abridgment of many of his own de&s;ires&mdash;that a religious life is the only means of procuring him <HI>real happine&s;s in this world</HI>&mdash;that fortune alone can never be a fource of happi|ne&s;s&mdash;that no fortune can &s;ecure a man again&s;t the mi&s;ery, and di&s;tre&s;s, which folly and extravagance occa&s;ion&mdash;that when vice is added to folly, and extravagance, they never fail to
<PB N="220" REF="226">produce in conjunction, a very com|plicated &s;cene of mi&s;ery&mdash;that a pro|fligate man of fortune is a cur&s;e to his neighbourhood: in return for the ble&s;&s;ings which God hath given him, he fir&s;t corrupts his own family; and then by his licentious manners &s;preads vice, and di&s;&s;ipation through the country&mdash;and la&s;tly, that altho few men attain &s;o <HI>perfect a character;</HI> or can be &s;o <HI>ba&s;ely depraved,</HI> as the two per&s;ons here repre&s;ented&mdash;yet in the &s;ame proportion, in which they approach the one character, or the other, they will feel the happine&s;s, or
<PB N="221" REF="227">mi&s;ery, which naturally belongs to each.</P>
<P>In the next memoir, the effects of religion on our <HI>future intere&s;ts</HI> are chiefly con&s;idered. It would be an unfaithful picture, unle&s;s it pointed out the temporal calamities al&s;o con|&s;equent on vice; but its primary in|tention is to illu&s;trate <HI>the triumph of religion over wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t <HI>accompli&s;hed libertine</HI> cannot pretend to more &s;hining qua|lities, or greater powers of mind, than Lord Roche&s;ter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. If a man of his parts and knowledge therefore
<PB N="222" REF="228">could not &s;atisfy him&s;elf with his dei&s;tical arguments, it is hardly to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that other infidels of inferi|or parts can hit upon arguments that are more &s;atisfactory. They &s;hould learn therefore to be a little more mode&s;t; and to doubt, whether their own conclu&s;ions are quite &s;o &s;afe, as they are willing to believe them.</P>
<P>Again, the mo&s;t <HI>abandoned libertine</HI> cannot enjoy more of the guilty plea|&s;ures of life than Lord Roche&s;ter did. If then the&s;e guilty plea&s;ures, when en|joyed in the highe&s;t degree, ended in the keene&s;t; di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;if nothing could remove this di&s;tre&s;s, but a &s;incere re|pentance,
<PB N="223" REF="229">and the hopes of forgivene&s;s through the atonement of Chri&s;t&mdash;if religion thus gave peace and happine&s;s to one of the greate&s;t &s;inners that ever lived&mdash;if it, and it alone could quiet his dying moments, and make him happier in the thoughts of leaving the world, than he had ever been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it&mdash;it follows, that the plea|&s;ures of &s;in are merely the baits of wickedne&s;s&mdash;that religion alone af|fords &s;olid comfort; and is indeed that alone, on which we can depend for happine&s;s in every circum&s;tance, and in every period of our lives.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="230">The la&s;t of the&s;e memoirs &s;hews re|ligion in that <HI>genuine purity,</HI> in which we &s;elclom &s;ee it. Amid&s;t the refine|ments of learning, and philo&s;ophy&mdash; the courte&s;ies of the world&mdash;the max|ims of trade&mdash;and corrupting amu&s;e|ments of life&mdash;we &s;ee chri&s;tianity tricked out in a variety of dre&s;&s;es, in which it is always di&s;gui&s;ed, and often deformed. Were we with hone&s;t and open hearts, to &s;ee religion &s;tripped of all the&s;e fal&s;e colours, it would &s;trike <HI>us,</HI> as it did the <HI>early ages,</HI> to whom it was fir&s;t preached, with its powerful influence <HI>in improving the nature of man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="231">To illu&s;trate this truth is the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the little narrative before us. A rude African comes among&s;t us, to|tally void of all ideas of religion. He is kept aloof from the plea&s;ure|able, and corrupting &s;cenes of life. Chri&s;tianity in its genuine form is placed before him. From his own wants, and imperfections he infers its nece&s;&s;ity. From its holine&s;s he infers its truth. He imbibes its genius. He changes his &s;avage manners. He be|comes a new man.

<PB N="226" REF="232">between <HI>knowing</HI> his duty, and <HI>prac|ti&s;ing</HI> it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the &s;tory of Naimbanna, is a beautiful illu&s;tration of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's injunction to <HI>receive the go&s;pel as little children:</HI> and it &s;hould convince us, that if <HI>we</HI> are de&s;irous to receive it in this manner, we &s;hould endeavour carefully to &s;e|parate it from the cu&s;toms and prac|tices of the world; which is one of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, and at the &s;ame time one of the &s;evere&s;t duties of a &s;tate of trial.</P>
