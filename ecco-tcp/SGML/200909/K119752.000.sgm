<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN we &s;aw a member of the Whig club made the-fir&s;t magi&s;trate of the capital, it was ea&s;y to predict by what &s;pirit the nominal acts of the city for the year would be directed: notwith&s;tand|ing it appears by the tables of the prices of wheat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> by Dr. Adam Smith, that when the price <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to advance, war &s;trongly retards that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">; and in every other ca&s;e greatly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> its rate; and that the increa&s;e of prices in y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs of &s;carcity is always greate&s;t in peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the revi&s;al of this letter, I had purpo&s;ed to give a note on this: but a continuation of Smith's table having fallen into my hands, I judged it u&s;eful to enter into the &s;ubject at large, which I have done in a tract recently pub|li&s;hed on the Depre&s;&s;ion of the Price of Corn in War.</NOTE>: yet many per&s;ons, having never examined this irre&s;i&s;tible body of evidence, hold the contrary,

and among the advantages of peace number the cheapne&s;s of bread. The opportunity of an un|precedented dearth was too precious for the engi|neers of the cabal to fling away: they conjoined the continuance of war and the price of bread together; affirming the fir&s;t, as they had done on a former occa&s;ion, to be the cau&s;e of the &s;econd. We may admit a part of tho&s;e who di&s;claim the inten|tion of exciting commotion hereby, to have done it bon&acirc; fide: but it cannot be doubted to be the object of others; and that there are men among them of exten&s;ive and curious information, whom the real fact has not e&s;caped, although it may not have been noted by all.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more opportune to the&s;e re|publican di&s;ciples of the Florentine, than the French propo&s;ition for a general peace; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> apparent eagerne&s;s, with which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> rhetoric of Buonaparte, &s;pecifying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eemed to court it. A common hall was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and peace petitioned for by exciting the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> expectation &s;tated above. The error was very general; it was calculated that it would operate generally; and that the example of the capital would be followed, and di&s;tract the whole country with riot and petitioning. The dexterity of the Cor&s;ican in this mea&s;ure has been undoubtedly great: all tho&s;e who before him have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the &s;eat of power for &s;ixteen or

proof of the &s;incerity of his de&s;ire to give peace to France and a bleeding world, that he has &s;ought for it in the way which is both the &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t certain; the path of glory.</P>
<P>But the Syeyes' of this country, into who&s;e hands this fu&s;ilader of municipalities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the fate of the magi&s;trates of Pavia, he thus wrote to the directory.&mdash;J'ai fait <HI>fu&s;iller la municipalit&egrave;.</HI> 10 Prairial, 1796. Bowles reflections, p. 85.</NOTE>, playing his own game at home, plays al&s;o the cards &s;o well; do not think him blind enough to imagine, that a general peace can take place with &s;ecurity to his power, and con&s;equently to his life. They know the example of the Romans has been aped and prated about many years, by every republican of France: and that this alien con&s;ul and his political Mentor, have extracted the whole &s;pirit of the hi&s;tory of that republic for his u&s;e.</P>
<P>They know he argues thus: In the Roman republic the reign of purity of private manners was univer&s;al, even in the turbulent times <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Gracchi. For Cicero &s;peaking of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> morals &s;ays, <HI>no one di&s;&s;olute man was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in tho&s;e mo&s;t exemplary times</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Illis optimis temporibus cum hominum invenire nequam neminem po&s;&s;es. Orat. pro M. Fonteio, c. 13.</NOTE>. At that period it appears, that the only moral quality from which the&s;e republicans derived per&s;onal honour, as ex|celling
<PB N="5" REF="7">
each other, was frugality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Cum in concionem L. Pi&s;onem Gracchus vocari juberet, et viator quaereret, quem Pi&s;onem? qu&ograve;d erant plures: <HI>Cogis me</HI> inquit, <HI>dicere inimicum meum,</HI> FRUGI.&mdash;Cic. ibid.</P>
<P>When Gracchus ordered Pi&s;o to be called by name in the a&s;&s;embly, and his officer a&s;ked of him which of the Pi&s;os? for there were many of that family: <HI>You compel me,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>to give my enemy the appellation of the</HI> FRUGAL.</P></NOTE>. And when this virtue, primarily u&s;eful to the individual, was a &s;ource of honourable and popular di&s;tinction, how prevalent mu&s;t it have been, together with its con&s;equences, moderate pa&s;&s;ions, the general ca&s;e of individuals, and contentment in their &s;itua|tions? yet with all the&s;e pre&s;ervatives of the whole&s;ome &s;tate of the public mind, it was cor|rupted by too &s;trong a portion of the leaven of political equality; whereby the con&s;titution of the republic was kept in &s;uch a con&s;tant inte&s;tine motion and fermentation, that war abroad was the &s;ole means of &s;ecuring any peace at home.</P>
<P>Yet if ever the &s;pirit of univer&s;al political equa|lity could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without external war, or the annihilation of government; Rome mu&s;t have held out an example of this po&s;&s;ibility. Its effects &s;eem there to have been &s;o mitigated as to dive&s;t it of danger, to the utmo&s;t degree of which we can form a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ption, by the exact &s;pirit and habits of &s;ub|ordination. The plebeians who had &s;haken the
<PB N="6" REF="8">
ba&s;is of the &s;tate, to obtain the capacity of being elected to certain high offices, for their whole body; as &s;oon as it was acquired, refu&s;ed to rai&s;e the mo&s;t eminent individuals of it to tho&s;e digni|ties. <Q>When the elections came on, the mo&s;t active declaimers and agitators of the tribunicial party &s;olicited the votes of the people in vain. They were animated with one &s;entiment while liberty and dignity were at &s;take; but with another, when the ce&s;&s;ation of the &s;truggle made way for the operation of uncorrupted judgment&mdash;all the military tribunes were created from the patricians&mdash;they were content that a plebeian <HI>could</HI> be legitimately nominated: where &s;hall we find now, (&s;ays the hi&s;torian) that mo|de&s;ty, that equity, that elevation of mind in a &s;ingle individual; which was then the character of the whole people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Liv. l. 4. c. 6.</NOTE>?</Q> And the populace and their leaders &s;eemed willing enough, for different rea&s;ons, to let their acqui&s;ition drop into ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vion, &s;o early as the year after it was obtained: for the fathers de&s;ired the con&s;ul&s;hip, to which they only were eligible, to be re&s;tored; <Q>and they carried their point&mdash;the people had lo&s;t the inclination of contending to which of the two honours they &s;hould elect patricians: while the leading ple|beians rather cho&s;e tho&s;e elections to take place,

in which they could not become candidates, than tho&s;e in which they were rejected as un|worthy of choice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Liv. c. 7.</NOTE>.</Q> It was at the interval of thirty-nine years after, and on the occa&s;ion of the gro&s;s mi&s;conduct of two of the patrician military tribunes, that the plebeians cho&s;e one of their own cla&s;s, in the whole number of tho&s;e officers, which was &s;even, "as an exerci&s;e of their right<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Liv. l. 5. c. 12. U&s;urpandi juris cau&s;&acirc; (P. Lic. Cal.) ad novum delibandum honorem habitus.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>While this &s;pirit of practical &s;ubordination &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; which was probably generated, as its duration was protracted, by the legal relation of patron and client; which in Rome &s;trongly cemented the plebeian to the patrician order; &s;uch an exem|plary and general power of morals, indu&s;try and frugality, was an in&s;ufficient counterpoi&s;e to the pernicious effects of one di&s;organizing principle. What therefore is to be expected of a nation, who&s;e morals having been long much relaxed, has now been &s;y&s;tematically taught to hold morality it&s;elf in contempt, as ho&s;tile in many re&s;pects to the laws of nature, clearly announcing them&s;elves in the voice of morbid pa&s;&s;ion and appetite? The ma&s;s of the people there are not rendered ea&s;y and con|tented in their private &s;ituations, by their frugality and indu&s;try: on the contrary, di&s;&s;olutene&s;s daily leads an unexampled proportion of them to ruin;
<PB N="8" REF="10">
and has left them nothing but the keen wants of habitual and extreme exce&s;s, and the inward irri|tation and &s;hame of guilty poverty, goading them to whatever unprincipled re&s;olution, &s;ubtlety, and de&s;pair can &s;ugge&s;t. If foreign war was nece&s;&s;ary to provide an outlet for the internal di&s;tempered &s;pirit of the one &s;tate, to pre&s;erve any authority to tho&s;e at the head of it; mu&s;t not that nece&s;&s;ity be indefinitely increa&s;ed in the other? and mu&s;t not a &s;hort interval of peace de&s;troy the pre&s;ent form of rule in France, together with its rulers?</P>
<P>Of the perpetual nece&s;&s;ity of external war to the Roman republic, no one can entertain a doubt: and the greater nece&s;&s;ity of it to France is equally clear. But its government has always laboured under a compul&s;ion to avoid a general peace, of a more imperative nature, cau&s;ed by the impo&s;&s;ibility of maintaining the armies on their return home.</P>
<P>How fully the Directory were &s;en&s;ible of this in the year 1797, will appear by what pa&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t a conference of its members with the committee of finance. They had repre&s;ented to the latter, that if they would &s;uffer 100 millions of livres to be put into their di&s;po&s;ition, they could obtain a peace: the requi&s;ition was granted. Gibert, a leading mem|ber of the committee and author of its reports &s;ays, the pretext was fal&s;e: and gives the following account of what pa&s;&s;ed at a &s;econd conference of the &s;ame parties. When the directory was obliged
<PB N="9" REF="11">
to go into the rea&s;ons, which had ob&s;tructed a peace taking place; "They appeared," he affirm|ed, <Q>to dread it, and to fear the return of the army into the interior.</Q> The committee then &s;aid, <Q>Do you dread our defenders? What then do you hope? Have you determined that they &s;hall peri&s;h in the enemies country?</Q> The reply was; <Q>We have no &s;uch thought: we wi&s;h to &s;ee them again and to embrace them: <HI>but who will maintain them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Copy of his &s;peech. Tableau &amp;c. de l'admini&s;tration, &amp;c. l'annee 1797. Sir F. D'lvernois, p. 126.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The be&s;t informed undertakers for the &s;incerity of Buonaparte's pacific propo&s;itions in this coun|try; perfectly know that his &s;ituation in this re|&s;pect, is not at all &s;uperior to that of the directory; whom &s;elf-pre&s;ervation compelled, never to be without a foreign war. And it is as manife&s;t to them as to him&s;elf, that he has fettered him&s;elf down to this, by a much more rigid nece&s;&s;ity, ari&s;ing out of a &s;pecial act of his own.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t u&s;urpers bribed their armies, fluc|tuating and almo&s;t ho&s;tile to them, to &s;upport them in the war, by the promi&s;e of that immen&s;e donative of a milliard of livres, 41,666,666&pound;. &s;terling, to be paid on its termination: in the &s;tate to which France was then reduced, they made the con|clu&s;ion of a peace impo&s;&s;ible to them&s;elves. The
<PB N="10" REF="12">
promi&s;e could not be accompli&s;hed; and they would have paid with their lives for the violation of it. However the &s;cythe which has cut down almo&s;t annually, every thing that is rooted and flouri&s;hes in the &s;oil of that violent revolution, had &s;wept them all away: and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;eemed in much le&s;s danger, of having the performance of a promi&s;e, to which they were not parties, exacted on pain of death.</P>
<P>But the con&s;ul has placed him&s;elf in the &s;itua|tion of the fir&s;t &s;et of rulers. In the commotions preceding the revolution of Fructidor, he was the fir&s;t commander, who engaged his army to declare again&s;t the party of the two directors, and the majority of the councils. The generals of the others followed his example: and in the mani|fe&s;toes of one of them, his particular creature, tran&s;mitted to the government then exi&s;ting in the name of his &s;oldiers; we find the following inter|rogation put to it: <Q>Where now is the <HI>milliard,</HI> promi&s;ed to us with &s;o much empha&s;is, when our &s;ervices were wanted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Declaration of the army of Hoche. Tableau, &amp;c. Sir F. D'Ivernois, p. 219.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>Thus Buonaparte rendered him&s;elf in&s;trumental to the revival of this expectation, when he wanted to trample underfoot a party, which had &s;hown a di&s;po&s;ition to call him to account<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Motion of Dumolard.</NOTE>: and to obtain effect to that expectation, the armies by force pro|tected
<PB N="11" REF="13">
him from an inquiry into his conduct; the ground of which, I &s;hall hereafter find nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate; and drove his opponents into exile. Hence he is con&s;cious that he dares not act contrary to the promi&s;e thus chargeable upon him, and that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for him to fulfil it. For the original decree was a &s;entence, by which France was condemned to pay a penalty of forty-two mil|lions &s;terling, on the return of peace; to an inex|orable claimant who will hear nothing of abatement or delay. A &s;um not now to be found unburied in that country; from which emigration and non-productive nece&s;&s;ity, has carried out money every year, fa&s;ter than requi&s;ition and plunder has brought it in. And for this payment the con&s;ul has thus given bond, under his hand and &s;eal.</P>
<P>If a tumultuous, debauched, irre&s;i&s;tible &s;oldiery could be brought to hear rea&s;on, he cannot alledge to them, as the expelled powers might have done, that the expectation was not given by us, or our friends on our behalf, but by our enemies; who have mo&s;t of them peri&s;hed, by your aid, in our pro&s;criptions: therefore we cannot carry into effect one of their engagements, the mo&s;t de&s;tructive to the country in pre&s;ent oppre&s;&s;ion, and future ex|ample. And the plenitude of power with which the la&s;t revolution has inve&s;ted the grand con&s;ul, robs him of the excu&s;e that was apparently well founded, in the impotence of the ill-con&s;tructed
<PB N="12" REF="14">
&s;y&s;tem la&s;t &s;uper&s;eded: the armies will demand that with the power they have conferred oh him, that he will work this impo&s;&s;ibility in their behalf.</P>
<P>The royalty of France when the country abounded in wealth, was &s;wallowed up in the gulph of a de|ficit: this greater gulph mu&s;t &s;wallow up and de&s;troy any &s;emblance of government, and &s;et of governors, which &s;ucceeds it, Provi&s;ional, Directorial or Con|&s;ular, which &s;hall make peace with all its enemies. But if it could be filled up, will not the &s;oldiery, grown in&s;olent in &s;haring &s;o rich a prey, &s;et up other preten&s;ions to &s;poil their native country? e&s;pecially any that can be pleaded with the colour of equity? The donative, they will &s;ay, is an ad|dition to our ju&s;t wages as &s;oldiers; not a di&s;charge of arrears due both for pay, and for provi&s;ion which we have been compelled to purcha&s;e, or to procure at the hazard of our lives, by modes forming no part of the duty of a &s;oldier. A de|mand for the&s;e arrears they certainly will not pa&s;s over: for in the manife&s;to before me, they urge the ju&s;tice of the claim <Q>of <HI>ten thou&s;and officers,</HI> to an adequate provi&s;ion, who have received no other price of their &s;ervices than their wounds; who are now langui&s;hing in the inner country, with|out &s;upport or help<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tableau, &amp;c. p. 219.</NOTE>.</Q> Yet, this provi&s;ion is an object with them far &s;econd to their own ar|rears,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
and certainly occurring to them much later.</P>
<P>When acting under the influence of Buonaparte, they have been taught to pre&s;s &s;uch preten&s;ions, on what they held to be the &s;overeign power of their country; will they not a&s;&s;ail him with the &s;ame, whom they look upon to be their creature, as holding his power in effect entirely from them? He cannot expect any thing el&s;e, than when the occa&s;ion occurs, to be attacked by the &s;ame com|bination of armies, and to hear the &s;ame menaces denounced again&s;t him, which he thus taught them to employ again&s;t others, who wi&s;hed to &s;et their claim to the donative a&s;ide; and that they will be carried into full execution. He dares not to conclude a general peace, without money in the trea&s;ury to pay the immen&s;e arrears of the army; and this donative of nearly forty-two mil|lions. The &s;eal to the decrees of the milliard is iron and infrangible: and the in&s;cription ingraved round it, is the unalterable de&s;tiny of the republic, <HI>meurs, ou tue</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"De&s;troy or peri&s;h." Corneille Le Cid. A. 1. Sc. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hence the con&s;ul knows, that the conclu&s;ion of a general peace mu&s;t be followed by his fall from his elevation; and that his tenure of life and of power mu&s;t terminate together. He offers, therefore, what it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to be deter|mined
<PB N="14" REF="16">
to carry into effect, in ca&s;e that offer were accepted.</P>
<P>It is thus this vice of rulers, this cut-pur&s;e of an empire rea&s;ons: and thus it is well known, by many at lea&s;t of tho&s;e, who maintain the &s;incerity of his de&s;ire for peace with the greate&s;t perverted ability, that he of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t rea&s;on. He has not hitherto &s;ucceeded any where in his overtures: and tho&s;e who &s;econd him here, have prevailed no farther, than to obtain a declaration from the capital. In their expectation that it would be a general example to the country, they have notori|ou&s;ly failed.</P>
<P>But the remotene&s;s of harve&s;t; and the alarm|ing pro&s;pect even of a &s;till higher price of food, before we can be relieved by it, is &s;uch; that many months of danger remain for us, and of expectation for them; in which they flatter them|&s;elves petitions will be heaped on petitions. The promoters of them are divided into two parties: one which knows it can have at no future time any acce&s;s to power but by &s;trange means; in the pre&s;ent &s;ingular calamity hopes to obtain it, from an effective although not nominal coercion of an excellent parliament: while the other to which the fir&s;t always affords a &s;olicitous protection, flatters it&s;elf with a general in&s;urrection, in con&s;equence of the expected firm|ne&s;s of that a&s;&s;embly, and by the cry of peace
<PB N="15" REF="17">
bread, to involve us in &s;anguinary civil wars, and de&s;olation.</P>
<P>The friends of their country then are to look forward, that every po&s;&s;ible attempt will be made by the two parties in conjunction, by propagating fallacies more or le&s;s artful, to convert the con&s;ti|tutional franchi&s;e of petitioning, to the one or the other of tho&s;e purpo&s;es. I here give an ab&s;tract of the other leading topics which will be employed by them on this occa&s;ion, previous to the demon|&s;tration of their fallacy.</P>
<P><Q>The &s;ole purpo&s;e of the continuation of the war on our parts, (the&s;e demagogues will con|tend) is the re&s;toration of the monarchy of France.

<P>In order to this, I mu&s;t &s;tate &s;ome important tran&s;actions which took place, in an early part of the long reign of the immediate predece&s;&s;or of Louis XVI; on which this moral obligation was founded. At the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Ha|nover, the eyes of a great party of the kingdom were not opened to the brilliant fortune, it was de&s;|tined to under the new dyna&s;ty.

or an anarchial democracy.

<P>Louis XIV, from political and other motives, was deeply engaged in the intere&s;ts of the Pre|tender.

<P>After its failure there were many, who other|wi&s;e wi&s;hed well to the Stuart line, yet were aver&s;e to its being placed on the throne by a power of the Romi&s;h religion, but who would with great alacrity have acted in its favour, if they had &s;een it's cau&s;e &s;upported in the kingdom by
<PB N="21" REF="23">
an army of foreign Prote&s;tants conducted by a good leader. George the fir&s;t had incurred the implacable re&s;entments of Charles the 12th, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing general of his age; he had al&s;o incen&s;ed Peter the Great: they &s;acri|ficed their rivality to dethrone him. And by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Peter, Charles was to have attempted this, at the head of a formidable Prote&s;tant force.</P>
<P>His mini&s;ter, the Baron Goertz, who had brought about this &s;ingular reconciliation, and a&s;&s;ociated Cardinal Alberoni in the con&s;piracy; went to the Hague to further its progre&s;s. And Gyllenburgh, the Swedi&s;h emba&s;&s;ador at London, carried on the plot with the di&s;affected here. Every thing &s;eemed to promi&s;e a &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue to it, when it was di&s;covered by the regent of France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voltaire's Life of Charles the 12th.</NOTE>: who &s;ent &s;uch intelligence of it to our court, as occa&s;ioned the arre&s;t of Gyllenburgh here, and of Goertz in Holland<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Univer.

By the aid of the regent the fir&s;t de&s;ign had been baffled, but the danger &s;till remaining was formidable. Again&s;t this France further concurred in guarding us, by entering into the treaty called the triple alliance; wherein was &s;tipulated, with
<PB N="22" REF="24">
what force the kings of England and France &s;hould aid each other, in ca&s;e of a rebellion in the dominion of either. By the terms of the treaty, the advantage to each &s;eems mutual: but the circum&s;tances of the period con&s;idered, when no danger menaced the throne of France, and that of the Hanoverian family in England was a&s;&s;ailed by a &s;trong dome&s;tic faction, and the coalition of the two mo&s;t able &s;overeigns who have reigned in Europe in the pre&s;ent century; the benefit of this mutual guarantee was intirely on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>The quadruple alliance, binding us to the &s;up|port of the king of France in ca&s;e of rebellion, was &s;igned in the following year 1718; in which the connection between Charles and Peter had been further &s;trengthened, by the conferences at Ahland.</P>
<P>It is proper to add here, that the &s;olemn adop|tion of the whole of both the treaties in that &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting with the unfortunate Louis, &s;trictly obliged us at the time of his depo&s;ition and impri&s;onment, to have concurred with the &s;tipulated force in any attempt for his pre&s;ervation and re&s;toration; or placing his &s;ucce&s;&s;or upon the throne, after he was murdered. And as far forth as the object convention of Pilnitz, was to maintain the gua|rantee of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, entered into in 1718, and to protect the per&s;on and family of the &s;ove|reign in France from danger then adequately ma|nife&s;t,
<PB N="23" REF="25">
&s;o far forth we, by the &s;pirit of tho&s;e arti|cles, were obliged to have concurred openly in its object, if unre&s;tricted by a nece&s;&s;ity which &s;hall be afterwards &s;poken of.</P>
<P>And on that treaty it&s;elf it is to be remarked; that the faction which finally depo&s;ed the king, had attained con&s;iderable &s;trength at the time it was made; and its objects were not indi&s;tinctly fore&s;een. Hence the emperor, being by the quad|ruple alliance obliged to take arms to &s;uccour the king on an actual attack; the &s;pirit of his obliga|tion, called upon him to keep his preparations in the &s;ame &s;tate of forwardne&s;s, as tho&s;e of the con&s;pi|rators. He was al&s;o in full right to form alliances for that purpo&s;e: as was the king of Pru&s;&s;ia to enter into a league with him, to enable him to fulfil any moral obligation: and the execution of every initially ju&s;t treaty is &s;uch.</P>
<P>The&s;e treaties were in terms equal; as pre&s;erv|ing to each &s;overeign the honourable appearance of being &s;eated with an equal &s;tability on his throne. In effect they bound France to the &s;up|port of the Hanoverian family; at fir&s;t certainly not firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed here, and at that particular juncture in much additional hazard: and Britain to the &s;upport of the crown of France; &s;eem|ingly in the firme&s;t &s;ecurity. This obligation, as undertaken &s;pontaneou&s;ly, was almo&s;t a nudum pactum and conventional only upon the latter:
<PB N="24" REF="26">
whereas on the &s;ide of Britain, it is conventional and moral. And this nation thereby came under a moral obligation, to give to the prince reigning in France, the &s;ame &s;upport the king of Great Bri|tain had received, the circum&s;tances being the &s;ame: that is to aid him again&s;t all rebels, during the time of peace. For it is dormant from its na|ture in every war, and revives on its termination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During a war the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a ho&s;tile power cannot be called in, to aid a king again&s;t his rebels.

It was therefore in force in the year 1792, when Louis was depo&s;ed: and not having been di&s;|charged to him, is yet due to his heirs.</P>
<P>But the affirmation of a moral obligation exi&s;t|ing in this ca&s;e, will be met by an objection, de|rived from the &s;upport that unfortunate prince was induced to give, in the time of full peace, to the revolted colonies; and his commencing a war for that purpo&s;e. Here it will be urged, that by giving aid to a rebellion again&s;t the family on the throne, he, by his own act, cancelled that obliga|tion as to him&s;elf. The objection might at fir&s;t fight be thought to have it's convenience, to tho&s;e who have contended for a declaration from this country, again&s;t all future aid to the re&s;toration of the French monarchy: but unfortunately for them,
<PB N="25" REF="27">
their mo&s;t avowed principles preclude them from the u&s;e of it. They maintain the re&s;i&s;tance of America to have been ju&s;tifiable; and therefore no rebellion; which is always, as the term imports, an unju&s;tifi|able re&s;i&s;tance: and where no rebellion took place, none was &s;upported. Hence they mu&s;t ad|mit, that if &s;uch obligation exi&s;ted before the French interpo&s;ition, it is not in the lea&s;t invalidated &s;ince. To the Whig club therefore, and its factious &s;up|porters, I pre&s;ent the following alternative for their choice. Was the re&s;i&s;tance in America a rebel|lion, or ju&s;tifiable? If you &s;ay a rebellion, then your principles, by your own confe&s;&s;ion, lead to re|bellion and civil war. If you &s;ay it was ju&s;tifiable, or no rebellion, then it remained matter of moral obligation to have given aid to the late king of France, after he had given his a&s;&s;ent to a con|&s;titution which you have declared to be <Q>the mo&s;t &s;tupendous and glorious edifice of liberty which had been erected on the foundation of human integrity, in any time or country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dod. Ann. Reg. 1791, p. 114.</NOTE>.</Q> For you mu&s;t admit that it was a rebellion which drove him from the throne this con&s;titution had erected and placed him upon, into a pri&s;on, and then bu|ried the throne it&s;elf beneath the ruins of this "mo&s;t &s;tupendous and glorious edifice of liberty;"
<PB N="26" REF="28">
or you mu&s;t deny the po&s;&s;ibility of committing the crime of rebellion.</P>
<P>The great body of tho&s;e who affirm the re&s;i&s;t|ance of the Colonies to Britain to have been a rebellion, are in fact adver&s;e to a declaration on our parts, again&s;t all future aid to the re&s;toration. However it may be proper to inquire, how far the point here maintained is affected, by admitting their affirmation. And here the quality of the in|terpo&s;ition of France in favour of the in&s;urgents is to be examined; as it mu&s;t be granted to have modified, although not annihilated, the moral ob|ligation, ari&s;ing from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France to the Hou&s;e of Hanover, in the mo&s;t difficult times. The object of this rebellion, was not to take a throne from an augu&s;t family on which the Hou&s;e of Bourbon had been very &s;erviceable in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing it; but to cut off from its dominions a remote and ill-connected province: of great magnitude indeed, but the Goitre of the empire; from which, with a true Alpine ab&s;urdity, we boa&s;ted that it derived both ornament and &s;trength&mdash;an error common to our rivals al&s;o. Our prior obli|gation, as it was exclu&s;ively founded on tho&s;e friendly acts &s;tated above, was to defend the king of France again&s;t a rebellion in the time of peace, the object of which was either to deprive him of his crown; or &s;uch a one as &s;hould be &s;et on foot to wre&s;t a &s;ingle province from him: the latter he
<PB N="27" REF="29">
cancelled by his act, whether he was influenced or uninfluenced in it, the ca&s;e is the &s;ame: that part of the obligation he did away: but the former, to de|fend him again&s;t all rebellions to depo&s;e him, re|mained.</P>
<P>But the treaties with France, furni&s;h us with further matter of comment, not to be pa&s;&s;ed over. The principle that we are not bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Hou&s;e of Bourbon, has been here examined and refuted, becau&s;e it is a topic to which recour&s;e is had to obtain petitions of a dangerous tendency. It al&s;o &s;trictly applies to the ultimate object of this letter, to &s;how from tho&s;e treaties, that the com|mon end of one party who will actively pu&s;h for petitions, the bringing of Mr. Fox and his attached phalanx into power, is in a high degree dangerous and di&s;honourable to this kingdom, as he maintains that this country ought to have made no efforts to re&s;tore the king and the monarchy of France; and concurs with tho&s;e who move us to declare, that we ought to di&s;avow all intention of continuing the war a day for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The articles of no treaty ever underwent a more thorough parliamentary examination than that of 1783; and this po&s;ition is &s;ub&s;tantiated by the part he took therein. The que&s;tion on the preli|minaries was a trial of &s;trength between two great parties, for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole govern|ment, which it was expected would prove deci&s;ive.
<PB N="28" REF="30">
I am not di&s;po&s;ed to defend them as either ade|quate or honourable. Their defects were examined with the greate&s;t attention.</P>
<P>The declarations of the Rockingham party, when the vote of cen&s;ure was pa&s;&s;ed by the commons on the articles, are to be regarded as tho&s;e of Mr. Fox; leaving what their new allies &s;poke on the &s;ubject out of the que&s;tion: becau&s;e, by the interpo&s;ition of Mr. Burke, he was become the leader of that party there: and every greater ground of objec|tion brought forward again&s;t them, was of cour&s;e &s;elected by him, or by others who con&s;ulted with him.

On the con|trary there ari&s;es a &s;trong pre&s;umption, that it was entered into with his total approbation; from his apprehen&s;ion of the effect this fourth power (which he had been de&s;irous of wedging into the very &s;ummit of the arch of the con&s;titution,) might have on tho&s;e of the crown; the perpetual admi|ni&s;tration of which he is &s;uppo&s;ed &s;oon after to have gra&s;ped at, by &s;trange means well coloured over. In power he wi&s;hed to guard him&s;elf again&s;t the di&s;charge and battery of his own engine: and was willing to provide him&s;elf beforehand with aid, from any quarter whence it might be obtained.</P>
<P>I place not here in too &s;trong a light, the danger of tho&s;e di&s;tempered times, before Mr. Fox's com|ing into the cabinet; when the wor&s;t &s;chemes re|ceived his mo&s;t decided patronage. And in proof of this, I will give you &s;ome traits of the de&s;crip|tion of them, tran&s;mitted to us by one who lived
<PB N="33" REF="35">
and acted a great part in that period; and was in much confidence even with the principal agita|tors: a great &s;tate&s;man, always temperately wi&s;e in his mea&s;ures; and who, in a life of active &s;er|vice to his country, which bloated blundering arrogance joined with impotent malignity drove him to write the apology of, boa&s;ted of his being able to prevent this cloud bur&s;ting out into a hur|ricane, as one of his be&s;t &s;ervices to the &s;tate. I mean the late Mr. Burke.</P>
<P>He de&s;cribes this time as <Q>one of the mo&s;t critical periods in our annals: there was a dread|ful fermentation. Wild and &s;avage in&s;urrection quitted the woods, and prowled about our &s;treets in the name of Reform. Other projects ex|actly coincident with this, &s;truck at the very exi&s;tence of the kingdom under any con&s;titution. There are who remember the blind fury of &s;ome, and the lamentable helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of others. At the &s;ame time a &s;ort of <HI>national convention</HI> &s;at with a kind of &s;uperintendance over parliament, and little le&s;s than dictated to it. And had the por|tentous comet of the rights of man, then cro&s;&s;ed upon us in that internal &s;tate of England, no|thing could have prevented our being irre&s;i&s;tibly hurried (like a planet) out of the highway of heaven, into all the vices, crimes, horrors, and mi&s;eries of the French revolution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter to a Noble Lord, p. 12, 13, 14.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="36">Mr. Fox, when he was in power, probably enter|tained &s;erious apprehen&s;ions, from the explo&s;ion of the&s;e prepared inflammable materials, to the accu|mulation of which he had contributed &s;o much; and thence came to wi&s;h for the reciprocal gua|rantee. Thinking that after the court of France had effected one democratic revolution, on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic; which had made a con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of its &s;ub|jects at home; that power would willingly concur with her real aid, to prevent the greater danger which might a&s;&s;ail her, from the example of a &s;econd breaking out at her own door.</P>
<P>Let us now grant that he condemned the mu|tual guarantee: that he even went &s;o far, as to u&s;e en|deavours to have it omitted in the definitive treaty, and that he failed therein; although he was able, in many other articles, to improve on the preli|minaries: yet neither he, nor any of his pre&s;ent maniple of a phalanx then acting with him, can pretend that it was not of intire obligation (and by his act in which they cordially joined) after the rebellion of the tenth of Augu&s;t. For he declared, and with much ju&s;tice, when the defi|nitive treaty came under debate; on a compari&s;on of the articles we had been engaged to, with our re&s;ources and tho&s;e of our late enemies: that <Q><HI>the faith of the nation</HI> was now taken again&s;t the &s;tate of the country. And this in his appre|hen&s;ion
<PB N="35" REF="37">
was a con&s;ideration of &s;o much weight, that now the bu&s;ine&s;s was concluded he would not he&s;itate to &s;ay, that, committed as the pub|lic faith had been by the preliminary articles, he would have concluded the definitive treaty upon the ba&s;is of them; if the mini&s;ters of the other belligerent powers, had thought proper to adhere to their letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New Ann.

<P>What will be &s;aid of the character of that na|tion, where po&s;itions contrary to the faith of trea|ties and moral obligation, are not only &s;upported in &s;enates, but &s;enates come to decree upon them? Are the articles of tho&s;e compacts which &s;heath the &s;word of war, and end the calamities of three quarters of the habitable globe, of no obligation? Or is that of the obnoxious article, the reciprocal guarantee, cancelled, becau&s;e if it could have been acted upon with effect in time pa&s;t, it would have prevented the mo&s;t atrocious &s;cene of crimes, and the mo&s;t dreadful calamities that in latter ages have vi&s;ited the world? Or if in future we may be able &s;o to act upon it, becau&s;e it pre&s;ents the be&s;t hope of that recovery from the&s;e afflictions a future ge|neration may rejoice in, but we &s;hall never &s;ee?</P>
<P>Grant that the violation of treaties is common: that is, has been &s;o frequent as to have been one of the mo&s;t terrible &s;courges to human kind: does Mr. Fox contend that there &s;hould be one more added to the number? In the mouth of any man, the
<PB N="36" REF="38">
&s;corn of that important part of the code of mo|rals, which binds nation to nation, would have co|vered him with di&s;grace; but &s;uch a man's offence will not nearly approach the rankne&s;s of his; it exhibits a contempt of hone&s;t political reputation, of which there are few parallels indeed in the hi&s;|tory of this kingdom.</P>
<P>For the reciprocal guarantee being now con&s;i|dered as one of the articles which he regarded as di&s;advantageous at the &s;ignature of the treaty; it mu&s;t be further a&s;ked did he not come for|ward and tell the body of the nation, through their repre&s;entatives, that there were bad arti|cles in the treaty, but that the public faith was pledged upon them; and if wor&s;e had been in&s;i&s;ted on, that faith was &s;o committed, it mu&s;t have been definitively given even to tho&s;e? But Mr. Fox was in office when the definitive treaty was concluded: he is therefore pledged per&s;onally, to endeavour to the utmo&s;t, that its letter and &s;pirit &s;hould be car|ried into effect: and he was not only in office, but he tells us <HI>it was concluded by him&s;elf</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 35. l. 5, extract of his &s;peech.</NOTE>.

In neither ca&s;e can &s;uch a man be ele|vated to power again, without extreme danger and di&s;honour to the kingdom.

<P>That he &s;hould maintain our mo&s;t &s;olemn na|tional engagements to foreign powers, to bind us no longer than it is our intere&s;t to adhere to them; is perfectly con&s;onant as to its &s;pirit, to what he

has laid down in parliament; that individuals may enter into engagements re&s;pecting the public, in|jurious to its intere&s;t, to avoid pecuniary lo&s;&s;es: and con&s;equently for pecuniary gain.</P>
<P>He has before been charged with this by &s;ome writers, but as it is wanted in proof here, the heads of the evidence &s;hall be repeated.

<P><PB N="40" REF="42">One of the motives alledged by Mr. Fox, to induce his friends to &s;ub&s;cribe the&s;e declarations; which, following him, they mu&s;t have reputed to be in&s;truments to promote the wor&s;t ends, is omitted above; <Q>to avoid the de&s;truction of their per|&s;ons and their hou&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burke's letter to the Duke of Portland, Art. 12.</NOTE>.</Q> It was certainly expe|dient for Mr. Fox, to feign the exi&s;tence of &s;ome more cogent nece&s;&s;ity to give colour to his criminal advice, than con&s;iderations of profit in trade could furni&s;h him with. If the danger alledged had been true, the principle his advice re&s;ts upon is im|moral: but the allegation was as defective in truth, as the principle in morality. I &s;hall proceed to &s;how it was a calumnious imputation on the friends of regular government, which he pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice of the minute: and that <HI>they were the per&s;ons</HI> who&s;e apprehen&s;ions were great; and who &s;ought in tho&s;e a&s;&s;ociations, &s;ecurity only.</P>
<P>I re&s;t this on the authority of what Mr. Chalmers has &s;aid, in the dedication of the la&s;t edition of that capital work, his E&s;timate, to Ja&s;per Wil&s;on, the A&s;tur of political arithmetic and oeconomy, and the perfect repre&s;entative of the Ligurian faith, and foppery of that hero of Virgil. "Hi&s;tory," &s;ays this well-informed ob&s;erver, <Q>will record the month of November 1792 as a memorable epoch in our annals. It was peculiarly unfortu|nate
<PB N="41" REF="43">
to our traders. Yet it was a month pro|pitious to the con&s;titution. I was not inatten|tive as you may &s;uppo&s;e to the pa&s;&s;ages of that month. I knew that the violence of the repub|licans, and levellers, had by its action and re|action, &s;pread terror far and wide. <HI>I was acquainted with per&s;ons who feared the lo&s;s of their lands from the tumults of the Jacobins at Shef|field. I was acquainted with per&s;ons, who &s;old their &s;tock in the Briti&s;h funds, in order to inve&s;t it where they &s;uppo&s;ed it would be more &s;afe. I was acquainted with tho&s;e, who di&s;po&s;ed at an under value of moveable property, which they ima|gined was mo&s;t likely to be de&s;troyed by innovation and tumult</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dedication, p. 49.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It might very well be expected, that this agi|tated &s;tate of the public mind, &s;hould be attended with dangerous effects to commercial credit: that &s;uch effects followed it, is indicated &s;ufficiently in the bankruptcies of that very month. In the pre|ceding ten months their number had been 476, or 48 monthly: in that, November, it &s;uddenly ro&s;e to 105. The greate&s;t number &s;tated in Mr. Chalmers's table for any month, in any preceding year, is 83: that of no other exceeded 70. In the month of December, in which Mr. Fox affirmed the &s;olide&s;t property to have been endangered, and con&s;equently mutual credit at its lowe&s;t depre&s;&s;ion, the bankruptcies were reduced again to 47, the ave|rage
<PB N="42" REF="44">
of the fir&s;t ten months of the year, and le&s;s than that of the preceding. Mr. Chalmers's ob|&s;ervation immediately annexed to the pa&s;&s;age be|fore cited is, <Q>Whether the&s;e apprehen&s;ions pro|duced any of the numerous bankruptcies of November 1792, I pretend not to know:</Q> that is from po&s;itive and particular information, as he knew the other effects of the national fears: on this fact he tacitly refers to the evidence of his table. He goes on to &s;ay, <Q>I believe that all terrors di&s;appeared, when the parliament was called, the militia were embodied, and, ABOVE all, when the nation with an overpowering voice, avowed her attachment to the con&s;titution, and promi&s;ed her &s;upport of the laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;timate, edition 1794, Introduction p. 49. and table, p. 46.</NOTE>.</Q> That &s;upport was engaged for, by the national acce&s;&s;ion to that a&s;&s;ociation, which was &s;et on foot on the 20th of this month of November by Mr. REEVES. It was, as Mr. Fox alledges, the commencement of the&s;e very a&s;&s;ociations, which cau&s;ed the terror of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination and plunder mentioned by him: as if &s;uch a terror could have exi&s;ted, when in the very month in the middle of which he made his declara|tion, the bankruptcies were reduced &s;uddenly, and nearly enough in the proportion of five to two.</P>
<P>We cannot much wonder to &s;ee that the &s;tate&s;|man who can teach individuals, that they may for
<PB N="43" REF="45">
the continuance of their private profit enter into &s;olemn engagements, in face of their country, contrary to their principles; &s;hould not he&s;itate to propo&s;e the breach pf tho&s;e which one country enters into with another, even although they be his own acts; when its intere&s;t, well or ill under|&s;tood, may &s;eem to require it; or, what with &s;uch a &s;tate&s;man is the &s;ame thing, when his own inte|re&s;t, well or ill under&s;tood, &s;eems to require it. And that there are ca&s;es, in which a &s;tate&s;man may ut|terly mi&s;take his own intere&s;t, is very evident: for if Mr. Fox had not contended for the infrac|tion of the guarantee, primarily his own mini&s;terial act; it is undeniably certain that he would at this in&s;tant have been high in power; or at lea&s;t that he would before this time, have been recalled to an eminent &s;tation; which he would have enjoyed for the whole term his infatuated impetuo&s;ity ordinarily gives him leave.</P>
<P>The infu&s;ing of the&s;e principles, relating to the engagements they give to the public, into the minds of the people at large; is great crime in a &s;tate&s;|man, and affects the total of his character as &s;uch. It is long &s;ince that the fact has been charged upon Mr. Fox with full evidence, by Mr. Burke, and no defence &s;et up in his behalf. Tho&s;e there|fore of his partizans who &s;ince continue to main|tain, that his public character is excellent and immaculate, are morally become acce&s;&s;aries after
<PB N="44" REF="46">
the fact: but if they &s;hall &s;ay that they never deigned to examine the charges of Mr. Burke again&s;t him; then the probability of that declara|tion mu&s;t be enquired into; and if the inquiry turn out in their favour, it follows from the de|fence e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the great name, the moral character, and the honour of the accu&s;er; that their bigotted belief of the impeccability of Mr. Fox, robs what they &s;ay in his prai&s;e of every pretence to more belief, than bigotry voluntarily blinding it&s;elf, can claim to its declarations to its fooli&s;h creed, from the authority due to the clearne&s;s of its views. And from this unfortunate po&s;ition, they can extricate them&s;elves only by proving the fal&s;ehood of their own plea &s;o &s;et up.</P>
<P>It is not the que&s;tion of peace or war which is examined in this part of my letter; it is not the prayer of the petitions pa&s;t and future; and the o&s;ten&s;ible pretence by which commotion is &s;oli|cited: it is the danger of the real object of one of the parties which promotes the petitions, that of the &s;uperior cla&s;s of agitators; namely, to have Mr. Fox called into power: the fir&s;t end with all, and with many the la&s;t; although they openly call for it only as the nece&s;&s;ary means to obtain the prayer of &s;uch petitions. This is the object here contended again&s;t, and it is this which makes his character as a &s;tate&s;man, clearly &s;hown in his public acts and declarations, an e&s;&s;ential inquiry at this juncture. The right to go into which, re|&s;training
<PB N="45" REF="47">
my condemnation of Mr. Fox to what ari&s;es from his public acts, he has fully admitted him&s;elf; in the debate on po&s;tponing the recom|mitment of the Quebec bill in 1791: when he declared, that <Q>the public has a right to the opinions of public men on public mea&s;ures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dod&s;ley's Ann. Reg. 1792. Hi&s;t. &amp;c. p. 117. 118.</NOTE>;</Q> meaning to include his own. A right which would be totally nugatory, if individuals had not be&s;ide a co-exi&s;ting and &s;ub&s;idiary right, to lay their com|ments on &s;uch opinions before that public: and he will not &s;ay, he meant to admit hereby a nugatory or non-effective right only to be ve&s;ted in it.</P>
<P>I have long anticipated a que&s;tion you may have formed in your own mind on the &s;ubject of the guarantee. You will a&s;k how has it happened, that in all the debates in which the re&s;toration of the hou&s;e of Bourbon has been con&s;idered, this article has never been brought forward, by tho&s;e who&s;e principles and arguments it would &s;o de|cidedly have &s;upported? The exi&s;tence of the guarantee having been proved, I am in full right to &s;ay, that whether an an&s;wer to this be or be not given, it can neither reinforce nor dimini&s;h the obligation ari&s;ing out of it; and &s;uch an an|&s;wer I am not of nece&s;&s;ity obliged to attempt to give: I &s;hall however revert to the que&s;tion after|ward; here it would be a mere &s;cholium. The bringing home the guarantee to Mr. Fox, and the deduction of its con&s;equences, although nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="46" REF="48">
connected with the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued to compel a pre&s;ent negociation with France, in the manner &s;hown above, yet has retarded the progre&s;s of the con&s;idera|tion of the former for no &s;hort time; and I decline entering into another branch of the &s;ubject, which will lead to a &s;econd di&s;cu&s;&s;ion lengthening that in|convenience. I therefore po&s;tpone the an&s;wer to this inquiry, noting only, that it terminates in a new proof of the danger and di&s;honour of ever, at any future period, intru&s;ting Mr. Fox with power.</P>
<P>It is only a few ob&s;ervations that I have to add, on the guarantee and its formal renunciation. It will be &s;aid, that the effective execution of it is evidently now impo&s;&s;ible, and that our obligation terminates with the po&s;&s;ibility. But political po&s;|&s;ibilities are &s;ubject to die and revive, alternately, at lea&s;t to all appearance. A few months continu|ance has not yet, in any ca&s;e, given &s;tability to tho&s;e who have u&s;urped power in France: and if there be &s;ome circum&s;tances which &s;eem to promi&s;e it to the pre&s;ent u&s;urpation, which were wanted to the former, they are more than overbalanced by the con&s;ul being an effective alien. The &s;pirit of revolution often &s;eems dormant, when it is &s;ecretly exerting it&s;elf with great efficacy; and may be really dormant, but not dead. Revolution in France, re&s;embles a certain in&s;ect, which the re&s;earches of modern naturali&s;ts have di&s;covered, and which from its ince&s;&s;ant gyration or rotatory motion, has obtained with us the name of the <HI>Wheel animalculum.</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="49">
It follows from what Dr. Pulteney, in his view of the writings of Linnaeus, tells us, that this great legi&s;|lator of natural hi&s;tory includes this &s;pecies among the <HI>Chaotic</HI> animalcula; which immediately follow the <HI>Furiae</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General view, &amp;c. p. 105.</NOTE>. When dried it will remain as du&s;t for long periods of time, but revives in full vigour by barely putting a &s;ingle drop of water upon it, and in&s;tantly re&s;umes its revolutionary movements. Now according to the average duration of a French con&s;titution, the pre&s;ent con&s;ular government &s;eems already to have &s;urvived almo&s;t a third of its term: the time may be a little more or a little le&s;s, for without a diligent inquiry, which I have not time to enter upon, an error may be ea&s;ily fallen into, in reckoning the periods of power enjoyed by their &s;everal &s;ets of rulers, before they have been &s;ent to Cayenne or the guillotine. But I have a de&s;criptive catalogue lying before me, drawn up by one of <Q>the curious</Q> in revolutions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Foulis's Hi&s;tory of Plots, p. 125.

However it evidently includes &s;ome provi&s;ional and con&s;tituent councils, which cannot be called governments: and we are not to reckon more than &s;even di&s;|tinct forms, con&s;tituted in that term; although
<PB N="48" REF="50">
two or three of them were violently or otherwi&s;e &s;et a&s;ide, and afterward re&s;tored again. Whence the mean duration of an experimental con&s;titution in England comes out to be 2 5/7 years, or two years, eight months, &s;eventeen days, and a &s;mall fraction: and if we admit the mutability of the French character to be to that of the Engli&s;h, in the exact ratio of two to one; then will the pro|bable length of the con&s;ular revolution be &s;ixteen months, and a few odd days; but con&s;iderably le&s;s than a fortnight.</P>
<P>Indeed the example of Harrington &s;hould &s;erve as a warning to tho&s;e, who at this time maintain the impo&s;&s;ibility of a regal counter-revolution in France. Hume &s;omewhere in his e&s;&s;ays tells us, that he had predicted, that the con&s;titution of this kingdom would permanently remain republican; a con&s;equence which he had deduced from &s;ome ab&s;tract political principle: I think it was, that no change could take place in the form of a &s;tate, after the center of power and the center of pro|perty were brought into coincidence. The la&s;t &s;heets of his work were not dry from the pre&s;s, when Monk was on his march from St. Alban's to London. France therefore is not arrived to the period which the lawyers would name, that after the po&s;&s;ibility of counter-revolution, extinct. But in a word, nothing can procure univer&s;al peace, but removing from tho&s;e who wield the force of repub|licanized
<PB N="49" REF="51">
France, the nece&s;&s;ity of continuing war to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the vengeance of their armies; who&s;e hopes of the immen&s;e donative mu&s;t be fru&s;trated on its conclu&s;ion. A &s;eparate peace, leaving a war on the continent, whereby the other powers, e&s;pecially SPAIN, Portugal, and the &s;maller German and Italian &s;tates, may one by one be &s;wallowed all in the vortex of the republic, or rendered dependent on it, ought not to be made; and a univer&s;al peace cannot. Therefore a declared dereliction of the guarantee contained in the la&s;t treaty, can effect nothing; or is neither nece&s;&s;ary or honourable, if renouncing engagements to which the body of the nation has in a &s;ingular manner pledged it&s;elf, and for no motive or fore&s;een effect at all, be both nugatory and di&s;honourable.</P>
<P><Q>But the ambition of the princes of the hou&s;e of Bourbon, and their in&s;idious policy, which ex|perience has &s;hown, to have formerly been almo&s;t perpetually employed again&s;t this i&s;land; is an argument, it will be urged, furni&s;hing the cleare&s;t demon&s;tration, that the intere&s;t of Great Bri|tain can never be promoted by their re&s;toration to the monarchy of France.</Q> This charge again&s;t them I &s;hall leave, without attempting to detract any thing from that &s;trength with which it may be &s;upported; and courteou&s;ly &s;uffer even &s;ome pre&s;ent overcharged exaggerations of it to pa&s;s. It will be here &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that as frail as the &s;e|curity of the faith of tho&s;e princes may have been, it
<PB N="50" REF="52">
mu&s;t be acknowledged, that &s;tronger reliance might at all times have ju&s;tly been placed upon it, than on that of the republic under the fir&s;t con&s;titution; on which there was more dependence than on the faith of the &s;econd: and that the engagements of the latter, were intitled to a greater confidence, than that which can be given to any treaty to be concluded with Buonaparte.</P>
<P>The proof of this will be evident enough, from the con&s;ideration I am now going to enter upon, of the further arguments of the pre&s;ent Gallomani&s;tes; and of &s;ome ci-devant Gallomani&s;tes, who&s;e mea|&s;ures and declarations &s;till continue, in different modes, to give the mo&s;t effective &s;upport here to the views of the great con&s;ul. <Q>They urge that our calamitous &s;truggle with France has been too long protracted, and by the mo&s;t futile of all preten&s;ions; that the rulers of the republic have been con&s;tantly incapable of maintaining the relations of amity with other &s;tates: a po&s;ition refuted by the real friends of their country, as often as it has been advanced.</Q></P>
<P>To &s;how the fallacy of this &s;turdy a&s;&s;ertion little remains for me to do, but to make extracts from &s;ome curious documents, brought together to my hand, in an excellent pamphlet publi&s;hed in the beginning of the pre&s;ent year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reflections on the political State of Society at the com|mencement of the year 1800, by John Bowles, E&s;q.</NOTE>: and to inquire as
<PB N="51" REF="53">
a con&s;equence deducible from them, how far the credit of tho&s;e who advanced it, and continue to repeat it, is at this juncture affected thereby, on que&s;tions relating to the propo&s;ed negociation.</P>
<P>The friends of their country had not failed to &s;tudy with accuracy, the general &s;pirit and detail of the &s;emi-organi&s;ed anarchy called the con&s;titu|tion, during the tyranny of Rober&s;pierre: and one re&s;ult of their &s;crutiny was, that thereby the party in power was unable to maintain the relation of amity with foreign &s;tates: or, in the language of Vatel, that by the fundamental laws no power was con&s;tituted, able to contract with validity. This charge again&s;t the new &s;y&s;tem was refuted here in|deed, as far as a po&s;itive declaration again&s;t it could go: but the party maintaining &s;uch power to have been any where ve&s;ted by it, omitted one mode to confirm their affirmation, which the laws of rea&s;oning, as they &s;tood before the revolution, obliged them to follow; namely to produce the title and &s;ection of the con&s;titution, in which this power was to be found.</P>
<P>After the fall of Rober&s;pierre, a committee was appointed to draw up the plan of a new con&s;titu|tion. They turned their views to the old one, and among other objects, to &s;ee what it e&s;tabli&s;hed on the head of compacts with foreign &s;tates. The re&s;ult of their &s;earch we are made acquainted with, by the &s;peech of Boi&s;&s;y d'Anglas to the national

a&s;&s;embly, in the name of that committee. After enumerating many defects of the &s;y&s;tem to be re|pealed, "what mu&s;t we think," &s;ays he, <Q>of a con&s;titution, in which no principle of relation to foreign powers is to be found<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tran&s;lation. Lloyd's Evening Po&s;t, July 1&s;t, 1795.</NOTE>?</Q> It is highly worthy of remark here, that while he adopts the charge advanced again&s;t the con&s;titution before exi&s;ting in France, and &s;o re&s;olutely denied by our oppo&s;ition, he at the &s;ame time adopts the very language in which it had been here expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem which originated from the labours of this committee was called the Con&s;titutional; as that which it &s;uper&s;eded, had been named the Revolutionary government. So lately as the month of November la&s;t, Boulay de la Meurthe con|firmed the declaration of Boi&s;&s;y d'Anglas, quoted above, relating to the former: <Q>It is well known</Q> (he affirmed) <Q>that peace could not be con|cluded, before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;ti|tutional government; for there then exi&s;ted a government which called it&s;elf revolutionary, and which afforded no certain guarantee either to things or per&s;ons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Bowles's Reflections, p. 135, 136, for this and the two following extracts from the &s;ame &s;peech.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Boi&s;&s;y d'Anglas, having been at the head of the committee to draw up the plan of the con&s;titu|tional government, it was to be expected that
<PB N="53" REF="55">
a power would have been &s;omewhere ve&s;ted in it, "to contract with validity" with foreign &s;tates. The mode in which De la Meurthe has lately ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on that head, &s;eems however to ca&s;t a doubt even on this; yet it does not amount to an ab|&s;olute negation of it, and it is known to have been true on other authorities. But there may exi&s;t in a &s;tate other incapacities to treat or be treated with, equal to the former in effect: for certain per&s;ons, by a con&s;titution of government, may have legal powers to conclude a formal treaty, to which that government it&s;elf is unable to give either force or continuance.</P>
<P>It is from Boulay de la Meurthe we are officially informed, that this was the ca&s;e of the republic, under the &s;y&s;tem which was called the Con&s;titu|tional government. <Q>It &s;hould &s;eem (&s;ays that great &s;tate&s;man of the new &s;chool) that this per|manence and guarantee <HI>ought to have exi&s;ted, from the e&s;tabli&s;hment, and by the operations of the con&s;titutional &s;y&s;tem;</HI> and yet there were not <HI>more,</HI> but perhaps <HI>le&s;s of them than before.</HI></Q> And by way of conclu&s;ion, he adds: <Q>Thus if we form an opinion according to well known facts, the French government cannot be con&s;idered as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any permanence, either with re&s;pect to men or things</Q>&mdash;<Q>it is found difficult to &s;tipulate con|ditions of peace, and &s;till more difficult to pre|&s;erve them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="56">Thus the fir&s;t con&s;titution afforded no certain guarantee either to per&s;ons or things, and the &s;e|cond was found more defective than the fir&s;t. <Q>Treaties of peace were quickly broken;</Q> <Q><HI>and became the &s;ource of a new war, &s;till more de&s;pe|rate and bloody than the former.</HI></Q> <Q>And the directory terrified all Europe; and de&s;troyed, according to its caprice, &s;everal governments.</Q></P>
<P>But this iniquity and caprice very inadequately accounts for the conduct of the directory: the motive to which, as it mu&s;t continue to act and produce the &s;ame effects in every form the republic may a&s;&s;ume, the &s;peaker, who was the "mouth piece" of its new rulers, was obliged to keep out of &s;ight. For none can doubt the iniquity of the old directors to have been intere&s;ted and &s;y&s;tema|tical; and nothing could have been of le&s;s power than caprice to determine in what acts it &s;hould manife&s;t it&s;elf: in this its members were guided by policy: and if general peace had been con&s;i&s;tent with their per&s;onal &s;afety, the be&s;t policy would have dictated that mea&s;ure to them. The impo&s;|&s;ibility of di&s;charging the donative to the army forced them to continue war; but a war that would maintain it&s;elf, and perhaps afford &s;ome &s;light temporary aids to their exhau&s;ted trea&s;ury. They were driven to &s;upport their armies as a Tartar feeds his herds: where there is but little plunder to be acquired in the one ca&s;e, and the
<PB N="55" REF="57">
herbage is almo&s;t eaten off in the other; the herd and the army are led, perhaps to very remote di&s;tances, to devour and fatten upon a fre&s;h coun|try. Hence we have &s;een their wars cea&s;ing in one quarter, and breaking out &s;uddenly and unex|pectedly in another: Germany began to threaten the republicans to be equally barren of triumphs and of plunder: a kind of treaty was &s;uddenly patched up with the Emperor; and the French armies were immediately &s;ent to invade the friendly territories of Egypt and Switzerland. It is the fear of the return of their armies home, that is the motive of their wars abroad: they ari&s;e from the inability of the &s;tate to pay the debt to them at the return of peace. It depends neither on the nominal powers of the executive govern|ment, nor the per&s;onal character of its members; it is not in the nature of a pentarchy, or a con&s;ular or a dictatorial government, to create the funds to di&s;charge this immen&s;e debt: although in the in|augural oration of the con&s;ular government, it was incumbent on Boulay de la Meurthe roundly to affirm the fir&s;t, and &s;uppre&s;s every idea of the &s;econd.</P>
<P>I have before endeavoured to prove to you, that the con&s;ul is compelled to maintain a perpetual war by a &s;tronger degree of nece&s;&s;ity, than that by which the directors were fettered. Boulay de la Meurthe indeed tacitly denies this nece&s;&s;ity, by
<PB N="56" REF="58">
a&s;cribing all their infractions of the laws of nations to their violences and the caprice of iniquity; and many argue &s;o here. Let us therefore now &s;uppo&s;e with him and them, that the continuation of the war and all the&s;e violations of the rights of foreign &s;tates; aro&s;e &s;olely from a bad &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment, and the bad character of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the executive power, and not from that nece&s;&s;ity hitherto in&s;i&s;ted on; and proceed to examine what the con&s;equence of this admi&s;&s;ion will be, on the que&s;tion whether we ought to have entered into a negociation, on the late invitation of Buonaparte.</P>
<P>As the infidelity of France to her compacts which took place under the &s;econd con&s;titution, was effectively greater than that under the fir&s;t; the &s;ole motives to our treating with her rulers now, mu&s;t be either the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity; or the expectation that the la&s;t revolution has introduced &s;ome amelioration to this evil. The fallacy of this &s;hall therefore be &s;hown, and moreover that there is a probability of great magnitude, that its effect mu&s;t be of a directly contrary nature.</P>
<P>The con&s;ular con&s;titution has given to Buona|parte, an authority much greater than that of the depo&s;ed directory. The plenitude of dominion or the intire &s;overeignty, is nominally divided be|tween the chief con&s;ul and his three &s;enates; as before between the directory and the two councils. But fetters have been forged for the latter, of &s;o complicated a contrivance, that the check upon his
<PB N="57" REF="59">
acts is a name only. The mea&s;ures therefore which will be pur&s;ued by the republic with re&s;pect to other nations, will be more fully impre&s;&s;ed with his character, than tho&s;e carried into execution un|der the con&s;titutional &s;y&s;tem, at any particular time, with the character of the directors then in authority. Hence the fidelity of the con&s;ul to his own public declarations and acts, becomes not only a proper but a nece&s;&s;ary object of diligent inquiry: the character of the &s;tate having now become iden|tified with his, there being no adequate balance to his power to direct its mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>But while that con&s;titution &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, the violation of the laws of nations by treachery and force &s;olely imputable to him, exceeded, in degree, the crimes of the &s;ame kind, great and many as they were, with which tho&s;e ephemeral tyrants were de&s;ervedly charged. And the atrocity of tho&s;e committed by him, were likewi&s;e further heightened by this cir|cum&s;tance; that if the enterpri&s;es to be con&s;idered had been politically ju&s;t, if undertaken by legitimate authority; yet in him they were high civil crimes; having been u&s;urpations of the right of the &s;ove|reign power he acknowledged, in its high capacity of making peace and war. Therefore, admitting as we mu&s;t do here, the authority from which he received his military appointment; the&s;e vio|lations of the law of nations were aggravated by a crime, his principals could not in the nature of
<PB N="58" REF="60">
things po&s;&s;ibly commit: they could not u&s;urp on their own &s;overeignty in matters of peace and war.</P>
<P>The&s;e acts were the &s;ubver&s;ion of the republics of Venice and Genoa. "It was on their ruins," &s;ays Mr. Mallet du Pan, <Q>that <HI>Buonaparte</HI> drew up the &s;entence of the neutral &s;tates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Merc. Brit. E&s;&s;ai, &amp;c. De&s;truc. de la L. Helv. p. 125.</NOTE>.</Q> And the criminality of the&s;e acts of "duplicity, rapine," and frontle&s;s infraction of the law of nations, was heightened by <Q>his ingratitude to the&s;e two re|publics; which from the day of his pa&s;&s;ing the Po, had loaded him and his army with gratifi|cations<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. 127.</NOTE>.</Q> This intelligent writer apparently brings forward the&s;e two u&s;urpations, as the wor&s;t in principle to be found even in the annals of the French revolution. And in effect, if the peculiar circum&s;tances attending them be examined in the proper point of view, they will &s;o be found to have been. For let it here for a moment be granted, that the law of nations is to give way, according to the new principles, to the repub|licanizing of Europe, in every ca&s;e where they come in competition; the de&s;truction of a republic, neutral in name, but in effect a dependent and obedient ally; is in one act, a &s;ubver&s;ion of the new and the old principles together. This re|mark on the character of the&s;e u&s;urpations it is
<PB N="59" REF="61">
not unnece&s;&s;ary to give, although, it is not to be imagined that any one, be his political &s;y&s;tem ever &s;o ho&s;tile to that Mr. Mallet du Pan was known to hold, will imagine him not minutely acquainted with the crimes of the French again&s;t other na|tions; or, that when his &s;ubject required him to bring forward the mo&s;t atrocious, that he would err in the examples he &s;elected.</P>
<P>But in the &s;ubver&s;ion of the&s;e friendly republics, Buonaparte clearly appears to have acted without orders or in&s;tructions from France. For when the conte&s;ts between the councils and the majority of the directory, which terminated in what is called the revolution of Fructidor, were approaching to a cri&s;is, Dumolard made a motion, that the directory &s;hould give an account of the revolutions of Venice and Genoa; effected <Q><HI>apparently</HI> without previous or|der<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pour demander compte au directoire, des revolutions en apparence <HI>inopin&eacute;es</HI> de Veni&s;e et de Genes.

And Mr. Mallet du Pan, &s;peak|ing of the &s;ubver&s;ion of the two republics &s;ays, that <Q>the&s;e exce&s;&s;es of Buonaparte, excited rather a de&s;ire than a determination to bring him to ju&s;tice.

<P><PB N="60" REF="62">The directory &s;eized with eagerne&s;s this oppor|tunity afforded to them by their adver&s;aries, of attaching Buonaparte to their intere&s;ts. <Q>They made no other an&s;wer to the demand, than di&s;|patching to him an o&s;ten&s;ible letter; in which they declared to him that <HI>they gave their full ap|probation to his conduct, both</HI> POLITICAL <HI>and mili|tary,</HI> namely, <HI>with re&s;pect to Venice and Genoa</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir F.

<P>It will not fail to &s;trike you, that if he had acted in con&s;equence of their in&s;tructions, &s;uch an ap|probation and ratification of his acts would have been not only totally nugatory, but even prejudicial to him: as it would have left him expo&s;ed to the charge of having acted without orders, in a mat|ter which the more re&s;pectable and popular party in France and in the councils, actually then treated as highly criminal. It is to be noted al&s;o, that a con|&s;iderable period was &s;uffered to elap&s;e, between the&s;e tran&s;actions of Buonaparte and the date of the approbation of the directory. There is there|fore a &s;trong probability, that they wi&s;hed to pre|&s;erve the&s;e charges of his acting without authority in matters of the very highe&s;t con&s;equence, out&s;tanding again&s;t him; in order to be produced at a proper time to annihilate the power he was acquiring, which began to over&s;hadow all others in the &s;tate: or at lea&s;t by the apprehen&s;ion of them, to reduce

But thus much undoubtedly follows, from this extract from Keppel's defence; <HI>that an admini&s;tration like a French directory,</HI> if the members were jealous of a com|mander employed by them; would not let &s;lip an opportunity of taking away his power, or reducing him to a degrading dependance upon them, if by criminally acting without orders, he &s;hould have given them an opportunity &s;o to do.</NOTE>. But the councils on this occa&s;ion commenced the proce&s;s of Buonaparte: the &s;tronger party in the direc|tory
<PB N="62" REF="64">
was weak in tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies; and the po|pular cry was again&s;t them: their whole depend|ance was on the military force. The u&s;e al&s;o of this accu&s;ation as an in&s;trument to re&s;train the power of the general, was taken out of their hands. There remained to them therefore only to pro|mote the intended proceedings again&s;t him, rather with di&s;grace than advantage to them&s;elves; as having for purpo&s;es not o&s;ten&s;ible, long tolerated gro&s;s crimes; while by concurring in the charge, they likewi&s;e were reduced to multiply their ene|mies, and take from them&s;elves the la&s;t hope of &s;upport: or they were con&s;trained to meet his ac|cu&s;ers in his defence, with a ratification of his acts; and by voluntarily making a common cau&s;e with him, to attempt to en&s;ure his &s;trong &s;upport.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that the inva&s;ion of Switzerland, which happened after the de&s;truction of the &s;i&s;ter republics of Venice and Genoa, was followed by more &s;anguinary &s;cenes: the plan of the fir&s;t is a&s;cribed to the directory; the latter were the acts of Buonaparte: and the determination upon
<PB N="63" REF="65">
them will be found the mo&s;t flagitious and faith|le&s;s. It is the degrees of infidelity &s;hown in the acts of the directory and the Cor&s;ican that are to be compared; not the mi&s;ery which in different countries, as a natural con&s;equence, has followed that of each. The two Italian &s;tates had granted if not anticipated every wi&s;h that Buonaparte could form from them: each had been &s;ub&s;ervient to his requi&s;itions, and furni&s;hed him with great loans for the &s;upport of his army. But Switzerland, although de&s;irous to pre&s;erve peace with this tyran|nical power, had furni&s;hed to it no &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance: on the contrary, the republic had &s;ent 25,000 men to the defence of Geneva when it was fir&s;t attacked by France; and forced her, for that time, to relinqui&s;h her prey. When the French were plundering Suabia, they armed to protect their own borders from their rapines: and if during their calamitous retreat, they &s;uffered a divi&s;ion of the army to re|turn to their native country through a part of their territories, they compelled them to pa&s;s through them di&s;armed. The inva&s;ion of Switzerland, as a violation of national faith, was no more &s;o than the conque&s;t of Venice and Genoa, and was not at the &s;ame time a violation of national gratitude; at lea&s;t in a &s;en&s;e any thing &s;o high as in the latter ca&s;e: and it is to be con&s;idered, that the moral criminality of doing an evil to a benefactor, is double to that of the &s;ame injury to an indifferent per&s;on.

Hence the&s;e infractions of the laws binding nation to nation, by Buonaparte; &s;how a more frontle&s;s defiance of the principles of their moral rights, than any act of the late directory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The de&s;truction of the Swi&s;s republic, and the &s;laughter and ma&s;&s;acres which attended and followed it; are above ex|clu&s;ively con&s;idered as the crimes of the directory then in power; becau&s;e the immediate agents were avowed by them. But when the fir&s;t mea&s;ures to con&s;ummate this great crime were in preparation, Mr. Mallet du Pan, who has written the hi&s;tory of this revolution of his country, who had the mo&s;t indefatigable attention to information of every kind, acce&s;s to the fir&s;t, and the fine&s;t abilities to make u&s;e of it; de&s;cribes Buonaparte him&s;elf as labouring <Q>to bury Switzerland under the ruins of Italy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ai hi&s;t. p. 126.</NOTE>;</Q> although at that very time, two of the five directors, Barthelemi and Carnot, exerted their endea|vours <Q>to turn away the blow meditated again&s;t that coun|try<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 129.</NOTE>.</Q> The revolution of Fructidor, effected by a mili|tary force headed by the creatures of Buonaparte, drove them into exile; <Q>a cata&s;trophe which decided that of the Helvetic body<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 128.</NOTE>.</Q> He therefore had taken mea&s;ures preparatory to its &s;ubver&s;ion, before it was determined upon by the execu|tive council of the republic.

<P>The inva&s;ion of Egypt is &s;aid to have been a project of Buonaparte's: but as in this he had the &s;anction of the direc|tory, he committed no act of u&s;urpation upon their authority; it therefore is to be taken as their act. Now as the Porte had never armed to protect any allied &s;tate from the iniquitous at|tempts of the republic, &s;o far the attack on one of its fine&s;t provinces, and the granary of the capital, was initially wor&s;e than the inva&s;ion of Switzerland. But as that power had not under the name of neutrality, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the progre&s;s of the French armies almo&s;t as a dependent ally; &s;till the re&s;olution to attack its dominions, had not all the turpitude of the de&s;truction of the republics of Venice and Genoa; undertaken by Buona|parte, without orders from his government.</P></NOTE>.</P>

his attention to decorum of manners has made him di&s;countenance, as far as he is yet able, &s;ome of that depraved licentiou&s;ne&s;s which has &s;pread over the country like a moral pe&s;tilence; or at lea&s;t he has checked the outward marks of it: he has lightened the re&s;traints, and removed the &s;evere oppre&s;&s;ions of the profe&s;&s;ors of a reli|gion, the great body of whom he may regard as his mo&s;t powerful and irreconcileable enemies: all practicable indulgence he has extended to the emi|grants; of many he has permitted and even in|vited the return; and his ju&s;tice and liberality has &s;oftened the mi&s;eries of others.

<P>And if in Egypt Buonaparte had found that the hypocritical a&s;&s;umption of &s;ome virtues, the fine playing off of &s;omething like redre&s;s of griev|ances; would have probably attached to him a confidence, which would have enabled him to carry his &s;anguinary &s;chemes of rapacity into effect; would he with more reluctance have a&s;&s;umed this other ma&s;k? Or is it contended, that to obtain the means of carrying his execrable de&s;igns into exe|cution, he would have rather cho&s;en to have com|mitted one of the mo&s;t impious crimes, than to have embraced a few mea&s;ures, which would have been of temporary benefit to &s;ome not unde&s;erving objects? Now if it be certain, that he would have put on this &s;pecious appearance of moderation in Egypt; &s;hall we believe he will not do the &s;ame in Europe? Among blind and ignorant barbarians, it may be &s;aid, who&s;e prai&s;e or reprobation could be of little honour or di&s;credit to him, he cared as little about the character of his mea&s;ures: but there is no effrontery, which does not &s;tand in more awe of the ju&s;t and indignant condemnation of wi&s;e and enlightened nations. The admi&s;&s;ion this contains that his acts are under the influence of
<PB N="70" REF="72">
no moral principle may be pa&s;&s;ed by.&mdash;But a&s;k at Venice and at Genoa, with what awe he regards the judgment and execration of this part of the world?</P>
<P>After the proclamation of Buonaparte in Egypt, it would &s;eem to be the extreme of folly, from the evident farce of the confe&s;&s;or at Dijon, to think him in real per&s;ua&s;ion a member of the Romi&s;h church: but certainly no man with any preten&s;ion to wi&s;dom, or any &s;tate governed by wi&s;e councils, can conceive that the wound he gave in that coun|try to the faith of his public in&s;truments, is in the &s;malle&s;t degree clo&s;ed thereby; or take any im|portant mea&s;ure in con&s;equence of that belief. Is he who can fal&s;ely, and with &s;olemn appeals to God, &s;et up a religious pretence for the purpo&s;e of &s;laugh|tering and pillaging a people at peace with him, worthy of credit a &s;econd time, be his &s;econd re|ligious profe&s;&s;ions ever &s;o &s;olemn? or may a true or a fal&s;e religion be &s;o &s;ported with? Even po|litical infidelity, which has not lo&s;t &s;ight of mo|ral &s;entiment and political wi&s;dom, would at all times have execrated &s;uch a conduct; and at this juncture will view it with a &s;tronger execration than ever. And to tho&s;e who continue to con|tend, that the hypocri&s;y of Buonaparte has not been &s;uch, as to deprive his declarations of all faith, it may be fairly urged; that he either be|lieves or di&s;believes the creed of the Romi&s;h Church: then they may be de&s;ired to make their
<PB N="71" REF="73">
election of either of the alternatives, the po&s;ition holds out to them: If they &s;ay he di&s;believes it&mdash; what is his act, in taking a confe&s;&s;or, and appointing him apartments at Dijon? It will not be affirmed it was a piece of the old etiquette of the revolu|tionary chiefs of the republic, which it was impo|litic to lay a&s;ide, for fear of affronting the princi|ples of his parti&s;ans: and which we have the guarantee of their influence over him, to expect &s;omething from. And in this ca&s;e, the language of the poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voltaire.</NOTE>, who when he cho&s;e it wrote morally, is perfectly applicable to him; &s;uch hypocri&s;y is a lie to God and to man. Now let his retainers take the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the alternative, and &s;ay that he holds the creed of that church: judging him then by his own private con&s;cience and belief, as &s;tated by them|&s;elves; could there be in him a more profane and public act of apo&s;tacy, than the fir&s;t words of his manife&s;to in Egypt? <Q>In the name of God gracious and merciful&mdash;<HI>there is no god but God;</HI>&mdash;he has no &s;on&mdash;no a&s;&s;ociate in his kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Proclamation.

u&s;e it as the mo&s;t probable means to bring them to maturity?</P>
<P>I proceed in the next place to &s;how, that the favourable &s;entiments now attempted to be propa|gated, of the moderation of his principles, on the foundation of &s;ome of his late acts, are refuted by proofs of his hypocri&s;y, even &s;uperior in validity, to tho&s;e brought above. Again&s;t the Romi&s;h church, of which he pretends to be a member, he has declared in words; again&s;t the &s;y&s;tem of mo|deration which he pretends to embrace, he has de|clared in words, and in the &s;tronge&s;t acts.</P>
<P>Every one knows, that during that part of the tempe&s;tuous night of the revolutionary tyranny, when Barthelemi was in the direction, and be|fore the violence of Thermidor; &s;omething like a dawn of moderation, like the beginning of the reign of a milder oppre&s;&s;ion began to appear. The &s;y&s;tem brought into action was the &s;ame, from which at this time the parti&s;ans of the con&s;ul draw their inferences, in favour of the principles of his future internal admini&s;tration of the country. Immediately before that cri&s;is, the councils and the directory were di|vided into two ho&s;tile parties: either of them at fir&s;t would gladly have availed it&s;elf, of the protection the general's a&s;cendency over the armies would have given it; and in return, he might have com|manded any terms from either, of which he could avow his de&s;ire: it was for a long time perfectly
<PB N="73" REF="75">
open to him to chu&s;e his party, to e&s;tabli&s;h its power, and reap great rewards from his act.</P>
<P>From the mea&s;ures then embraced by the general again&s;t moderate party we may judge, from what &s;incerity of principle his late a&s;&s;umed moderation flows; a quality to which at that time, he gave the fatal name of royali&s;m. It was to cru&s;h its parti&s;ans, that he <Q>demanded of his legions, whe|ther they were not ready, if it were nece&s;&s;ary, to pa&s;s with the rapidity of the eagle, the moun|tains which &s;eparated them from France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir F.

magic circle, which the con&s;titution had traced round the &s;eat of legi&s;lation and government: and the majority of the directory, aided by Buona|parte's agent Augereau, who was appointed by him for that purpo&s;e, &s;ent the defenders of that moderation he now is &s;aid to a&s;&s;ume, to a death almo&s;t certain, in the pe&s;tilential mora&s;&s;es of Cayenne. The di&s;po&s;ition the mo&s;t open to con|fidence, mu&s;t &s;ee in his a&s;&s;umption of the appear|ances of moderation, nothing at pre&s;ent, but a new act of political hypocri&s;y; and that in&s;tead of adding faith to the mo&s;t &s;pecious propo&s;itions, it dimini&s;hes the minute probability of &s;incerity, which they might otherwi&s;e have carried.</P>
<P>His &s;udden di&s;play of reverence for a religion he has &s;olemnly abjured, and of an attachment to political virtues he has per&s;ecuted with pro&s;cription and death, carry &s;uch evident marks of being the meer &s;acrifices of hypocri&s;y to a temporary expe|dience, that no ab&s;urdity can &s;urpa&s;s that of the endeavour to extract an argument from them, to prove that he, who, when his authority was limited, regardle&s;s of tho&s;e limits, trampled with greater per|fidy on the law of nations, than the directory them|&s;elves, who left all other criminals recorded in the hi&s;tory of Europe far behind them; will now, armed with great and independent powers, fulfil the contracts he may enter into with foreign &s;tates, with the cu&s;tomary degree of fidelity with which
<PB N="75" REF="77">
they are in fact ob&s;erved between nation and na|tion; however &s;hort that may fall, of the &s;anctity with which they ought to be adhered to.</P>
<P>In a word, from the very commencement of his political and military career, Buonaparte &s;eems to have been attached to no religious or moral prin|ciples but tho&s;e of Dicaearchus, of which Polybius has tran&s;mitted to us the following account.</P>
<P><Q>When the la&s;t Philip of Macedon, contrary to the faith of treaties, determined to attack the Cyclades; he had the command of the enter|pri&s;e. Placed at the head of an expedition ap|parently &s;o impious, he &s;topped not at the &s;imple commi&s;&s;ion of a great crime; but carried his in&s;olence &s;o far, as to determine to a&s;toni&s;h gods and men. Therefore on his arrival in port, he erected two altars; con&s;ecrating one to Impiety, and the other to Inju&s;tice; and offered &s;acrifices upon each<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B. 17. c. 6. from the tran&s;lation of Thuillier in Folard.</NOTE>.</Q> Curious as the monuments of ancient Greece are, this marble mu&s;t be one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular, even among them: the Buccaneer nation in its univer&s;al robberies, has profe&s;&s;edly &s;eized with particular avidity, on all the fine or &s;in|gular remains of Grecian art: if it &s;hould have fallen into their hands, and now decorates their o&s;tentatious and crammed repo&s;itory of &s;tolen goods; that altar might well &s;uit the Cor&s;ican to
<PB N="76" REF="78">
&s;wear to the future treaty, and offer the federative &s;acrifice upon, with the orthodox rites e&s;tabli&s;hed at its con&s;ecration by its pious founder. But we ought to put little confidence in &s;uch rites, or the per|manency of the compacts we enter into with the votary of &s;uch divinities. No party I &s;uppo&s;e among us will controvert this conclu&s;ion, hardly an individual; except there &s;hould be found one, who having officially advi&s;ed, that we &s;hould become bound to the aid of the exiled family of the Bour|bons, may in his parliamentary capacity, per&s;i&s;t to urge for a declaration of the nation by its repre&s;enta|tives, that it will in no wi&s;e, in any future in&s;tant of the pre&s;ent war, endeavour to perform the obli|gation we have laid our&s;elves under. But when the great con&s;ul &s;hall &s;o ratify that peace, which is to join together the conflicting nations in bands of perpetual amity, happily of a firmer texture than the former weak ligaments the &s;ame in name only, but liable four or five times in every century, to be untwi&s;ted by perfidy, or cut through by the &s;word of ambition; we mu&s;t intirely agree with his par|tizans&mdash; &s;uch a &s;tate&s;man, and &s;uch a one only, will be worthy to receive on our parts, that high and &s;olemn ratification.</P>
<P>There are other points of view of high import|ance, on which the fallacy of the preten&s;ion of tho&s;e, who contend that we ought to have entered into negociations on the late propo&s;ition from France, and renounced immediately the guarantee
<PB N="77" REF="79">
of that monarchy, might be &s;hown; and which even reduce tho&s;e who maintain them to the mo&s;t indefen&s;ible &s;ituations. But I &s;hall not now or pro|bably in future, enter upon them: inclined here to quit the argument, and not &s;topping to add any farther matter, even to anticipate one or two fri|volous objections to what I have written above; which may or may not occur, to the open or hy|pocritical enemies of the real peace and happine&s;s of the nations of Europe.</P>
<P>But although I refrain from con&s;idering any fur|ther objections to the matter I have written; I &s;hall &s;tate and con&s;ider one which will be made to its manner.</P>
<P>Again&s;t that it will be zealou&s;ly urged, that na|tions with whom we are in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility, or the rulers of &s;uch nations, &s;hould never be attacked with the &s;trong and indignant language of crimina|tion: for even where its ju&s;tice cannot be di&s;puted, it operates on their minds as in&s;ult, provoking added injuries on their parts; and no good purpo&s;e can be an&s;wered by exa&s;perating repre&s;entations. That the lines of &s;uch pictures, when drawn by the pencil of a profe&s;&s;ed enemy, are &s;eldom truly drawn: and if they obtain not general credit, will be e&s;timated as the imbecillity of virulence; but if unfortunately they become the popular belief, they may put off the return of a peace, until long after the term a nation, &s;o deluded, may have
<PB N="78" REF="80">
felt that it becomes nece&s;&s;ary: and the po&s;&s;ibility that term may arrive, no one can deny.</P>
<P>To what is &s;aid of nece&s;&s;ity, it is readily an|&s;wered, that in this ca&s;e, the nece&s;&s;ity admitted has certain qualities by which it may be de&s;cribed: it mu&s;t be &s;uch a one as can be acted upon; but this it cannot be, when the public enemy is under a nece&s;&s;ity of continuing the war. We mu&s;t look al&s;o to its origin; the difficulty and danger of con|tinuing the war: but again&s;t this is to be &s;tated, the danger emergent upon the peace: that after we &s;hall have di&s;armed, a perfidious enemy will certainly watch his opportunity to renew the war, at a cri&s;is mo&s;t convenient to him&s;elf, and threat|ening to be mo&s;t fatal to us: and here the balance of danger and difficulty &s;eems on the other &s;ide. And this nece&s;&s;ity is moreover required to be of that urgency, which gives to a nation a real di&s;pen|&s;ation from a moral obligation, &s;uch as the guarantee is; for public treaties con&s;titute &s;uch an obligation.</P>
<P>Nor can &s;uch charges, in any po&s;&s;ible though improbable ca&s;e, be attended with the irritating effect &s;uppo&s;ed, on tho&s;e again&s;t whom they are brought. The facts on which they are grounded, are all tran&s;cribed literally, from authorities of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive circulation: and the cen&s;ure would be very &s;ingular on any one, that he recalls from oblivion, what is of a nature never to be forgotten. There remains only therefore one circum&s;tance in
<PB N="79" REF="81">
which this letter can have the tendency cen&s;ured: that the&s;e facts are con&s;idered here &s;omewhat in a new point of view, and applied to in a new way to the que&s;tion. But here I am &s;en&s;ible that tho&s;e who take up all the re&s;t of the objection again&s;t me, will be among the fir&s;t to deny the charge on my behalf. And however de&s;irous I may be, to enter on a defence again&s;t it my&s;elf, I rely with much more confidence on the zeal and ability with which they will do it for me: I leave it to them therefore intirely, without &s;ugge&s;ting a &s;ingle hint, which they might apply on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But until the virtuous &s;entiments of moral in|dignation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Butler's Sermons, &s;ermon 8th, 5th edit. p. 143, and the Analogy, part 1. ch. 3. of the Moral Government of God, 4th &s;ection.</NOTE>, <Q>the &s;trong antipathy of good to bad,</Q> &s;hall be eradicated by the reformers of our nature (for even the moral con&s;titution of our nature ordained by Providence has its &s;et of re|formers).

<PB N="80" REF="82">
new victims to the repetition of former crimes. Where they have been fatal to individuals only, the truth of this has never been conte&s;ted: but a po|litical party now contends, that this does not hold equally true of &s;uch as may involve &s;tates and na|tions in utter de&s;olation; and their native country as well as any other; the mi&s;ery ari&s;ing from which, mu&s;t be perpetuated to many generations. But tho&s;e who &s;hall venture to cen&s;ure the indig|nant &s;tatement of crimes that are the &s;courges of the world in awful periods like the pre&s;ent, mu&s;t rank under one of the three following de&s;criptions: either of parti&s;ans of the criminals and promoters of the &s;ucce&s;s of their meditated enormities; or of factionaries, who for a chance of obtaining gain or power, determinately involve their country in the hazard of de&s;truction; or men of that duped and devoted blindne&s;s, whom the calamities of others, will never teach wi&s;dom for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is therefore not only defen&s;ible but nece&s;&s;ary and right, to call the friends of their country to look with &s;olicitous apprehen&s;ion, to the events which mu&s;t follow a peace, &s;igned by the &s;ame hand which guaranteed the &s;tates of Venice and Genoa, and almo&s;t before the ink of the &s;ub&s;crip|tion was dry, &s;ub&s;cribed the in&s;truments of their annihilation. They may ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e the motives of the grand con&s;ul the &s;ame in any future treaty with us, as in his two latter compacts with them; to lay a&s;leep the vigilance of the &s;tate, the de&s;truc|tion
<PB N="81" REF="83">
of which he is plotting: expecting that if after the peace we continue powerfully armed, the ex|pen&s;e will fo&s;ter the &s;pirit of di&s;content until it be matured into in&s;urrection among us, without his appearing at fir&s;t to ca&s;t any fuel upon the fire. And in ca&s;e we di&s;arm, the corre&s;pondence of the two countries being re-opened, his plan will be to employ every machination, to inflame and propa|gate the &s;pirit of anarchy and rebellion in every cla&s;s, by the aid of which he will renew his ho&s;tile attack upon us with better hope of &s;ucce&s;s. If we be thus forced into a &s;econd conte&s;t, in victory we &s;hall have much to fear, in con&s;equence of the burthen of another war almo&s;t immediately &s;uc|ceeding the pre&s;ent; from the inflammable &s;tate and perverted di&s;po&s;ition of the populace, and the criminal ambition of their greater and le&s;s leaders; educated and di&s;ciplined in the arts of attacking and &s;ubverting civil government, by the experience of more than ten years here, and the example of the more &s;ucce&s;sful divi&s;ions of their fraternity abroad, embarked in the &s;ame warfare, and acting with the utmo&s;t dexterity, and frequently with &s;ucce&s;s in the &s;ame and almo&s;t every other variety of circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>But it is time to put an end to this very long letter, with a&s;&s;urances that I am, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD promi&s;ed in my letter a particular ac|count of the &s;ilence ob&s;erved on the &s;ubject of the guarantee, by the leaders of both parties. As it had already run to a great length I could not there enter fully into the complicated detail it would lead to: I &s;hall therefore add here as a Po&s;t&s;cript an analy&s;is of what, in &s;uch an account, I &s;hould have in&s;i&s;ted on. This I had de&s;igned to have done in a &s;econd letter, an intention &s;ome rea&s;ons have in|duced me to lay a&s;ide.</P>
<P>The motives of the &s;ilence of oppo&s;ition in both hou&s;es, may be di&s;patched in a &s;ingle &s;en|tence. To have brought the guarantee forward, would have been an appeal to the national faith and honour again&s;t the mea&s;ures they recom|mended; involving the per&s;onal condemnation of their two leaders.</P>
<P>That of admini&s;tration is to be accounted for in a different manner: it may be &s;hown that the guarantee has been by them fulfilled in act; and there has occurred only two periods in which cir|cum&s;tances &s;eemed to call upon them to declare its exi&s;tence; in either of which, the declaration would have greatly tended to defeat the execution of it.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="85">The fir&s;t, was when the king of France was put under re&s;traint: the &s;econd, when war was proclaimed again&s;t us.</P>
<P>It could not be declared at the fir&s;t period: fal&s;e conceptions had been taken up, artificially height|ened, and long &s;upported concerning the nature of the revolution; its popularity was then hardly upon the wane. Admini&s;tration had equipped three armaments in a few years of peace; in con|&s;equence of which they were taxed with eagerne&s;s to plunge the nation into a war, to di&s;play their abilities in the conduct of it. The la&s;t they were compelled by clamour to lay a&s;ide; its object had been to e&s;tabli&s;h the emancipation of Poland from the yoke of Ru&s;&s;ia, and its new &s;oberly free con|&s;titution; and to re&s;train the increa&s;e of that over|grown power in another quarter: But although it &s;eemed to fall in with the current of popular opi|nion, then &s;etting &s;trongly in favour of liberty, it was defeated with a high hand. To have declared for the guarantee at the fir&s;t period, would have been con&s;trued as a confirmation of the charge of eagerne&s;s for war; it mu&s;t have been oppo&s;ed by the force of that current; and would have been con|demned as an effective acce&s;&s;ion to the treaty of Pilnitz, always unpopular although ari&s;ing out of the quadruple alliance formed by <HI>a Whig mini&s;try</HI> here, when the hou&s;e of Hanover was in its greate&s;t danger; and the guarantee of its &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="84" REF="86">
which has the broade&s;t and mo&s;t definite ba&s;is.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence and obligation of the guarantee to the hou&s;e of Bourbon, could not be declared at the &s;econd period, or when France proclaimed war again&s;t us; without the danger of &s;acrificing the object to the formality. For the war was &s;up|ported in both hou&s;es and in the nation at large by a coalition of parties: the one ho&s;tile to the ruling powers in France, on account of the revolution (at lea&s;t in the &s;hape it had taken) the inva&s;ion of Holland and their other u&s;urpations; and the other party for the &s;econd rea&s;on only. And a declaration for the guarantee at that time probably would have di&s;&s;olved this junction again: a hazard, which even for the intere&s;t of the unfortunate fa|mily of Bourbon, it would have been impolitic to have run; becau&s;e the latter divi&s;ion of this coali|tion, always readily &s;up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed the aids from time to time given to the royali&s;ts; as a cu&s;tomary mode of carrying on ho&s;tilities, again&s;t a power with which we were at war.</P>
<P>Thus the effect of the guarantee has been &s;e|cured without the declaration, which might have been endangered by its having been made when cir|cum&s;tances &s;eemed to call for it: and it may very well &s;o go on in execution. Thus the formal de|claration, at the commencement of the la&s;t war with France, having been omitted at the cu&s;to|mary
<PB N="85" REF="87">
period, it was not declared afterwards: and as at that time, the armaments again&s;t France were an affirmation in act by admini&s;tration, of the ex|i&s;tence of a war, and of their full knowledge and admi&s;&s;ion of that fact; the armaments in favour of the royali&s;ts, and other aids given them, amount on the part of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration to the &s;ame affirmation in act, of the exi&s;tence of the guarantee, without the formality of a declar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n of it.</P>
