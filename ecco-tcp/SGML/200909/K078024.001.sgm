<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I were not anxious to acknowledge you among&s;t the number of tho&s;e, who&s;e u&s;eful infor|mation has in various in&s;tances tended to improve this Work, motives of e&s;teem would alone induce me to in|&s;cribe it to you. The reflection, that for ten years pa&s;t, it has been &s;anctioned with no incon&s;iderable &s;hare of public approbation, will not allow me to believe it un|worthy of your attention, and its conclu&s;ion affords me the be&s;t opportunity to te&s;tify the favour, as well as the re&s;pect, with which</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I remain, Mo&s;t &s;incerely yours, E. DONOVAN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AT the conclu&s;ion of a Work which has been pub|li&s;hed in a progre&s;&s;ive manner, and either in the form of Monthly Numbers or Annual Volumes has already pa&s;&s;ed the ordeal of public critici&s;m, the Author can have little to advance in favour of the de&s;ign, or the manner in which it has been executed. His chief object was to illu&s;trate the &s;cience of Entomology on a more exten&s;ive &s;cale than had been previou&s;ly attempted in this Country, and he tru&s;ts, upon the whole, his endeavours in this re&s;pect have not been fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>As a general Hi&s;tory of the In&s;ect Productions of Great Britain, it is pre&s;umed this Work will be found &s;ufficiently copious and in&s;tructive; for though the Author has pur|po&s;ely avoided entering too deeply among&s;t the minutiae of the In&s;ect race, he has been careful to include what|ever is intere&s;ting. The &s;election of Papiliones or Butter|flies is extremely ample, as well as that of the Sphinges
<PB REF="4">
or Hawk Moths: none of the larger kinds of Phalaeuae or Moth tribes have been over-looked, and the number of tho&s;e of an inferior &s;ize that are extremely rare, or particularly beautiful, are altogether con&s;iderable. Tho&s;e are chiefly alluded to, becau&s;e general ob&s;ervers are more immediately intere&s;ted with the uncommon elegance of the Lepidopterous tribes than any others. In general, however, the reader will meet with &s;ome information in every department, as nothing material in any cabinet to which he has acce&s;s has been omitted.</P>
<P>The arrangement of the &s;ubjects is for the mo&s;t part conformable to the &s;y&s;tem of Linnaeus, with occa&s;ional reference to the writings of Fabricius. This is de&s;igned to a&s;&s;i&s;t the labours of the practical Entomologi&s;t, and by combining novelty with beauty, and &s;cientific information, may induce many other attentive ob&s;ervers of nature to pur&s;ue this plea&s;ing and intere&s;ting &s;tudy.</P>
<P>The Author cannot but feel &s;ome degree of &s;atisfaction in having at lea&s;t fulfilled the chief object of his fir&s;t de&s;ign, and after the labour of ten years completed a Work, perhaps the mo&s;t exten&s;ive that may ever appear in this form on the &s;ubject of Briti&s;h Entomology; but this con&s;ideration will not permit him to entirely abandon his favourite pur&s;uit: his attention will be &s;till directed to a &s;cience in which the pa&s;t indulgence of a liberal pub|lic,
<PB REF="5">
have induced him to believe he may &s;till be u&s;eful, and though he cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with the conditions of this undertaking, extend it further at this time, &s;hould a &s;ufficient number of new and valuable &s;pecies occur, he will certainly be tempted to tran&s;gre&s;s, and make &s;ome addition to the pre&s;ent &s;election.</P>

<HEAD>TRANSFORMATIONS OF INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>Many of our readers are no doubt acquainted with the &s;ingular transformations In&s;ects undergo, but we tru&s;t tho&s;e will pardon a digre&s;&s;ion which may be u&s;eful to tho&s;e who have not that knowledge; and without premi&s;ing farther we proceed to inform them, that In&s;ects in general undergo a material change in their form at &s;tated periods of their lives; there are &s;ome, though few, which bur&s;t forth from the egg perfectly formed, as <HI>Spiders,</HI> &amp;c. but the greater part exi&s;t in four &s;everal &s;tates: the fir&s;t that of the egg, whence the Larva, or Caterpillar is produced; it is at fir&s;t very minute, but in this &s;tate it feeds, &s;ome kinds on one or two plants only, others promi&s;cuou&s;ly on many, they therefore continue to increa&s;e in &s;ize, moulting &s;everal times the outer &s;kin, until the de&s;tined period of their dormant &s;tate approaches; they then &s;pin a web more or le&s;s &s;trong according to the &s;pecies, and are converted into the aurelia, or chry&s;alis; and la&s;tly they bur&s;t forth in due &s;ea&s;on perfectly formed. It is under this form they propagate a future race, and them&s;elves peri&s;h, as they rarely &s;urvive the inclemencies of the winter.</P>
<P>The antient naturali&s;ts held &s;uppo&s;itions very imperfect and erro|neous relative to tho&s;e transformations, but <HI>Malpighi</HI> and <HI>Swammer|dam</HI> proved by many accurate examinations clearly, that tho&s;e changes were not &s;uddenly effected, but gradual; and that under the form of the Caterpillar they could di&s;tingui&s;h the future changes the In&s;ect would undergo.</P>

<P>The conformity and likene&s;s which prevails between the male and female throughout the greater part of the animal &s;y&s;tem, cannot how|ever in In&s;ects be implicitly depended on; the difference in many is &s;uch as even to mi&s;lead &s;ome very accurate Entomologi&s;ts, the illu&s;trious Linnaeus not excepted. In this &s;pecies it is not &s;o great as
<PB N="6" REF="17">
in many, but &s;uch as entitles the female to a figure in a future plate: Our figure is of the male.</P>
<P>Albin, (<HI>Plate</HI> 25, <HI>Subject</HI> 37,) has given a figure of the male and female on the &s;ame plate, and de&s;cribes a male to have changed to the aurelia &s;tate as in our plate repre&s;ented <HI>July</HI> 16, and <HI>March</HI> 18 fol|lowing to have produced the Fly. But the time of their appearance de|pends on the proportion of heat or cold; as the author's &s;ubject was pre|&s;erved from the &s;everity of winter, in a warm room. The u&s;ual time to find them in the caterpillar &s;tate is Augu&s;t, and in April the Fly.</P>
<P>The &s;ingular provi&s;ion which nature makes for the protection of this Fly de&s;erves particular notice; when the time of its continuation in the caterpillar &s;tate is expired, by much labour it forms a kind of bag or pur&s;e, of a very tough &s;ub&s;tance; this it fixes again&s;t the trunks of trees, &amp;c. by a number of hairs or filaments, which remain on the external &s;urface. It lines the outer ca&s;e by one of a finer texture, the top of which is clo&s;ed by &s;everal bri&s;tles that unite in the center, exactly repre&s;enting a cap, and excludes almo&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of its receiving an injury during this defencele&s;s &s;tate. In this bag it pa&s;&s;es to the aurelia, and remains until the birth of the perfect in&s;ect.&mdash;Our figure repre&s;ents the chry&s;alis or aurelia in the bag; part appears torn away to exhibit its &s;ituation therein.</P>
<P>Were we to unite the &s;everal accounts of authors re&s;pecting its food, it would appear to be a general feeder; it will live on the ro&s;e, the elm, and the willow; and on thorns and brambles particularly.</P>

which, this &s;hell is &s;o tran&s;parent that the whole motion of the inte&s;tines is very vi&s;ible by a good magnifier.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be granted that, but for the micro&s;cope, the wonders of the minute creation, would be to us entirely unknown; our ideas could never &s;uppo&s;e the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e animated forms which occupy the immea&s;urable &s;pace between an apparent atom and nothing. The myriads of animals, thou&s;ands of times &s;maller than a mite, mu&s;t evade our cognizance, and be an actual conviction of their non-exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>But with all the utility that the micro&s;cope can boa&s;t, no in&s;tru|ment is &s;o likely to mi&s;lead the mo&s;t accurate ob&s;erver, particularly if not in the habit of u&s;ing it; the variations of light, the difference of the magnifying powers, or the damage the gla&s;&s;es may meet with by accident, &s;uch as requires every one to examine with the greate&s;t care; one degree of light may bring an object to view, whil&s;t another may entirely blend it with the fluid it exi&s;ts in; or one gla&s;s may di&s;cover &s;pines on an object, another gla&s;s might have repre&s;ented perfectly &s;mooth; it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to begin with a &s;mall power, in pro|portion to the &s;ize of the object, and to proceed to deeper mag|nifiers after.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome difference in our figure, and tho&s;e either of <HI>Barbut,</HI> or of <HI>Baker,</HI> which appears chiefly from our u&s;ing a &s;ingle lens nearly of the deepe&s;t power convenient to u&s;e. Our gla&s;&s;es were the 20th and 30th of an inch focus.</P>
<P>We very attentively examined the eyes, and found, not one, but two, placed near each other, on a &s;cale or plate of a black colour; hence ari&s;es the appearance of a &s;ingle eye by a &s;mall magnifying power.</P>
<P>The tail pre&s;ents a forked appearance by a deep power, and the eggs are contained in two bags, one on each &s;ide the tail. The co|lour varies probably in proportion to the nature of its food, to pale green, more or le&s;s of a red, or of a grey brown colour.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="description">
<P>To acquire a proper knowledge of the formation of this minute in|&s;ect, it is nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e a micro&s;cope with a gla&s;s &s;tage for objects, or rather &s;uch as admit of nicely adju&s;ting a talc as occa&s;ion may re|quire: the in&s;ect to be taken from the water with a camel-hair pencil, and carefully placed on the talc; after which it may be examined by a magnifier of 1/10 of an inch focus; but in proceeding to a deeper power, let the talc be turned the upper &s;urface with the in&s;ect in the drop of the fluid from the lens, and thereby the lens may approach the object to its proper focus; without this caution the lens would be frequently immerged in the water, and entirely ob&s;truct the &s;ight.</P>
<P>In the adult &s;tate, the opacity of the bivalve &s;hell, its external co|vering, &s;o entirely ob&s;cures the internal motion, that nothing, except the filaments it throws from the aperture or opening, is vi&s;ible by the micro&s;cope.</P>
<P>It breaks from the egg perfectly formed, but very minute and tran&s;|parent; this is therefore the be&s;t time to di&s;cover its &s;tructure, and from one in this &s;tate we have taken our figure</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="29">By the antennae it directs its cour&s;e, as does the <HI>Monoculus Quadri|cornis;</HI> and like it al&s;o it hath two eyes fixed in the &s;hell, but it can com|pletely envelop its head in its bivalve covering; its mouth is beneath, but the numerous filaments it darts forth, cau&s;es &s;uch a violent motion in the water, that the minuter in&s;ects are unre&s;i&s;tingly drawn between them, and forced to the mouth.</P>
<P>The motion of its lungs is very vi&s;ible, as are al&s;o the ve&s;&s;e ram<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls|fying thence.

<P>Thus it exi&s;ts, a life of rapine and de&s;truction, enjoyed at the ex|pence of the lives of thou&s;ands; and as the objects of its ravenous di&s;|po&s;ition are defencele&s;s, &s;o are they the &s;port of their conqueror: the few moments of intermi&s;&s;ion its craving appetite grants them, is occu|pied equally in the &s;poil, fir&s;t pre&s;&s;ing them to death, and then to&s;&s;ing them undevoured into the fluid.</P>

<P>This Tick is one of tho&s;e dete&s;table race of animals who&s;e miutene&s;s &s;ecures it from danger, while it draws nutriment from the blood, and frequently from the vitals of larger in&s;ects.

<P>They are plentiful in June and July, in Kent and E&s;&s;ex, and in many other parts of Britain.</P>
<P>The females are known by their maxillae being much &s;horter than tho&s;e of the males; they depo&s;it their eggs under the bark of old trees, either oak or a&s;h, and the food of the larvae, or grubs, is the internal &s;ub&s;tance of the trunk, fir&s;t reduced to a fine powder; they undergo transformation in this cell, and force a pa&s;&s;age through the bark when perfect beetles.</P>
