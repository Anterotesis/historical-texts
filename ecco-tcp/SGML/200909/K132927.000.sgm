<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following pages are on a &s;ubject hitherto little under&s;tood, but highly intere&s;ting to the United States.</P>
<P>They contain an inve&s;tigation of the claims of Virginia to the vacant we&s;tern territory, and of the right of the United States to the &s;ame; with &s;ome outlines of a plan for laying out a new &s;tate, to be applied as a fund, for carrying on the war, or redeeming the national debt.</P>
<P>The reader, in the cour&s;e of this publication, will find it &s;tudiou&s;ly plain, and, as far as I can judge, per|fectly candid. What materials I could get at I have endeavoured to place in a clear line, and deduce &s;uch arguments therefrom as the &s;ubject required. In the pro|&s;ecution of it, I have con&s;idered my&s;elf as an advocate for the right of the &s;tates, and taken no other liberty with the &s;ubject than what a coun&s;el would, and ought to do, in behalf of a client.</P>
<P>I freely confe&s;s that the re&s;pect I had conceived, and &s;till pre&s;erve, for the character of Virginia, was a con|&s;tant check upon tho&s;e &s;allies of imagination, which are fairly and advantageou&s;ly indulged again&s;t an ene|my, but ungenerous when again&s;t a friend.</P>
<P>If there is any thing I have omitted or mi&s;taken, to the injury of the intentions of Virginia or her claims, I &s;hall gladly rectify it; or if there is any thing yet to add, &s;hould the &s;ubject require it, I &s;hall as chearfully undertake it; being fully convinced, that to have matters fairly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and properly under&s;tood, is a principal means of pre&s;erving harmony and perpetuating friend|&s;hip.</P>

<HEAD>PUBLIC GOOD, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we take into view the mutual happine&s;s and united intere&s;ts of the &s;tates of America, and con&s;ider the im|portant con&s;equences to ari&s;e from a &s;trict attention of each, and of all, to e|very thing which is ju&s;t, rea&s;onable and honourable; or the evils that will follow from an inattention to tho&s;e principles; there cannot, and ought not, to remain a doubt, but that the governing rule of <HI>right</HI> and mutual good mu&s;t in all public ca&s;es finally pre&s;ide.</P>
<P>The hand of providence has ca&s;t us into one common lot, and accompli&s;hed the independence of America, by the unanimous con&s;ent of the &s;everal parts, concurring at once in time, manner and circum&s;tances. No &s;uperi|ority of intere&s;t, at the expence of the re&s;t, induced the one, more than the other, into the mea&s;ure. Virginia and Maryland, it is true, might fore&s;ee, that their &s;taple com|modity, tobacco, by being no longer monopolized by Bri|tain, would bring them a better price abroad: for as the tax on it in England was treble its fir&s;t purcha&s;e from the planter, and they being now no longer compelled to &s;end it under that obligation, and in the re&s;tricted manner they formerly were; it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that the article, from the alteration of the circum&s;tances of trade, will, and daily does, turn out to them with additional advan|tages.</P>
<P>But this being a natural con&s;equence, produced by that common freedom and independence of which all are par|takers, is therefore an advantage they are intitled to, and on which the re&s;t of the &s;tates can congratulate them without feeling a wi&s;h to le&s;&s;en, but rather to extend it. To contribute to the encrea&s;ed pro&s;perity of another, by the &s;ame means which occa&s;ion our own, is an agreeable reflection; and the more valuable any article of export becomes, the more riches will be introduced into and &s;pread over the continent.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4">Yet this is an advantage which tho&s;e two &s;tates derive from the independence of America &s;uperior to the local circum&s;tances of the re&s;t; and of the two it more particu|larly belongs to Virginia than Maryland, becau&s;e the &s;taple commodity of a con&s;iderable part of Maryland is flour, which, as it is an article that is the growth of Europe as well as of America, cannot obtain a foreign market but by under &s;elling, or at lea&s;t by limiting it to the current price abroad. But tobacco commands its own price. It is not a plant of almo&s;t univer&s;al growth, like wheat. There are but few &s;oils and climes that produce it to advantage, and before the cultivation of it in Virginia and Maryland, the price was from four to &s;ixteen &s;hillings &s;terling a pound in England.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See &s;ir Dalby Thomas's hi&s;torical account of the ri&s;e and growth of the We&s;t-India colonies.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the condition of the vacant we&s;tern territory of America makes a very different ca&s;e to that of the cir|cum&s;tances of trade in any of the &s;tates. Tho&s;e very lands, formed, in contemplation, the fund by which the debt of America would in a cour&s;e of years be redeemed. They were con&s;idered as the common right of all; and it is only till lately that any preten&s;ion of claims has been made to the contrary.</P>
<P>That difficulties and differences will ari&s;e in communi|ties ought always to be looked for. The oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts, real or &s;uppo&s;ed; the variety of judgments; the contrariety of temper; and, in &s;hort, the whole com|po&s;ition of man, in his individual capacity, is tinctured with a di&s;po&s;ition to contend; but in his &s;ocial capacity there is either a right which, being proved, terminates the di&s;pute, or a rea&s;onablene&s;s in the mea&s;ure, where no direct right can be made out, which decides or com|promi&s;es the matter.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall have frequent occa&s;ion to mention the word <HI>right,</HI> I wi&s;h to be clearly under&s;tood in my definition of it. There are various &s;en&s;es in which this term is u&s;ed, and cu&s;tom has, in many of them, afforded it an intro|duction contrary to its true meaning. We are &s;o natu|rally inclined to give the utmo&s;t degree of force to our
<PB N="7" REF="5">own ca&s;e, that we call every preten&s;ion, however found|ed, <HI>a right;</HI> and by this means the term frequently &s;tands oppo&s;ed to ju&s;tice and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>After Theodore was elected king of Cor&s;ica, not ma|ny years ago, by the meer choice of the natives, for their own convenience in oppo&s;ing the Genoe&s;e, he went over into England, run him&s;elf into debt, got him&s;elf into jail, and on his relea&s;e therefrom by the benefit of an act of in&s;olvency, he &s;urrendered up, what he called, <HI>his</HI> kingdom of Cor&s;ica, as a part of his per&s;onal property, for the u&s;e of his creditors; &s;ome of whom may hereaf|ter call this a charter, or by any other name more fa&s;hi|onable, and ground thereon what they may term a <HI>right</HI> to the &s;overeignty and property of Cor&s;ica. But does not ju&s;tice abhor &s;uch an action, both in him and them, un|der the pro&s;tituted name of a <HI>right,</HI> and mu&s;t not laughter be excited where ever it is told.</P>
<P>A right, to be truly &s;o, mu&s;t be right in it&s;elf; yet ma|ny things have obtained the name of rights, which are originally founded in wrong. Of this kind are all rights by meer conque&s;t, power or violence. In the cool mo|ments of reflection we are obliged to allow, that the mode by which &s;uch right is obtained, is not the be&s;t &s;uited to that &s;pirit of univer&s;al ju&s;tice which ought to pre&s;ide equally over all mankind. There is &s;omething in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch a right that we wi&s;h to &s;lip over as ea&s;ily as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;ay as little about as can be. But in the ca&s;e of a <HI>right founded in right</HI> the mind is carri|ed chearfully into the &s;ubject, feels no compuction, fuf|fers no di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ubjects its &s;en&s;ations to no violences, nor &s;ees any thing in its way which requires an artificial &s;moothing.</P>
<P>From this introduction I proceed to examine into the claims of Virginia; fir&s;t as to the right, &s;econdly as to the rea&s;onablene&s;s, and la&s;tly as to the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The name, <HI>Virginia,</HI> originally bore a different mean|ing to what it does now. It &s;tood in the place of the word North-America, and &s;eems to have been intended as a name comprehen&s;ive of all the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements or co|lonies on the continent, and not de&s;criptive of any one as di&s;tingui&s;hing it from the re&s;t. All to the &s;outhward
<PB N="8" REF="6">of Che&s;apeak, as low as the Gulf of Mexico, was called South-Virginia, and all to the northward North-Virgi|nia, in a &s;imilar line of di&s;tinction, as we now call the whole continent North and South-America.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Oldmixon's hi&s;tory of Virginia.</NOTE></P>
<P>The fir&s;t charter or patent was to &s;ir Walter Rawleigh by Queen Elizabeth, of England, in the year 1583, and had neither name nor bounds. Upon &s;ir Walter's return, the name <HI>Virginia,</HI> was given to the whole country, in|cluding the now United States. Con&s;equently the pre&s;ent Virginia, either as a province or a &s;tate, can &s;it up no exclu&s;ive claim to the we&s;tern territory under this pa|tent, and that for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, becau&s;e the words of the patent run <HI>to &s;ir Walter Rawleigh, and &s;uch per&s;ons as he &s;hould nominate, them&s;elves and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors;</HI> which is a line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion Virginia does not pretend to &s;tand in; and &s;econdly, becau&s;e a prior que&s;tion would ari&s;e, name|ly, who are to be under&s;tood by Virginians under this patent? and the an&s;wer would be, all the inhabitants of America, from New-England to Florida.</P>
<P>This patent, therefore, would de&s;troy their exclu&s;ive claim, and inve&s;t the right collectively in the thirteen &s;tates.</P>
<P>But it unfortunately happened, that the &s;ettlers under this patent, partly from mi&s;conduct, the oppo&s;ition of the Indians, and other calamities. di&s;continued the pro|ce&s;s, and the patent became extinct.</P>
<P>After this James the fir&s;t, who, in the year 1602, &s;uc|ceeded Elizabeth, i&s;&s;ued a new patent, which I come next to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>This patent differed from the former in this e&s;&s;ential point, that it had limits, whereas the other had none: the former was intended to promote di&s;coveries where e|ver they could be made, which accounts why no limits were affixed, and this to &s;ettle di&s;coveries already made, which likewi&s;e a&s;&s;igns a rea&s;on why limits &s;hould be de|&s;eribed.</P>
<P>In this patent were incorporated two companies, call|ed the South-Virginia company, and the North-Virginia
<PB N="9" REF="7">company, and &s;ometimes the London company, and the Plymouth company.</P>
<P>The South-Virginia or London company was compo&s;ed chiefly of London adventurers; the North-Virginia or Plymouth company was made up of adventurers from Plymouth in Devon&s;hire, and other per&s;ons of the we&s;t|ern parts of England.</P>
<P>Tho' they were not to fix together, yet they were al|lowed to chu&s;e their places of &s;ettlement any where on the coa&s;t of America, then called Virginia, between the latitudes of 34 and 45 degrees, which was a range of 760 miles: the &s;outh company was not to go below 34 degrees, nor the north company above 45 degrees. But the patent expre&s;&s;ed, that as &s;oon as they had made their choice, each was to become limited to 50 miles each way on the coa&s;t, and 100 up the country; &s;o that the grant to each company was a &s;quare of 100 miles, and no more. The North-Virginia or Plymouth company &s;ettled to the ea&s;t|ward, and in the year 1614 changed the name, and cal|led that part New-England. The South-Virginia or Lon|don company &s;ettled near cape Henry.</P>
<P>This then cannot be the patent of boundle&s;s extent, and that for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, becau&s;e the limits are de&s;cri|bed, namely, a &s;quare of 100 miles; and &s;econdly, be|cau&s;e there were two companies of equal rights included in the &s;ame patent.</P>
<P>Three years after this, that is, in the year 1609, the South-Virginia company applied for new powers from the Crown of England, which were granted them in a new patent, and the boundaries of the grant enlarged; and this is the charter or patent on which &s;ome of the pre&s;ent Virginians ground their preten&s;ion to boundle&s;s terri|tory.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t reflection that pre&s;ents it&s;elf on this enlarge|ment of the grant is, that it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to bear &s;ome intended degree of rea&s;onable compari&s;on to that which it &s;uperceded. The former could not be greater than a &s;quare of one hundred miles; and this new one being granted in the lieu of that, and that within the &s;pace of three years, and by the &s;ame per&s;on, James the fir&s;t, who was never famed either for profu&s;ion or gene|ro&s;ity,
<PB N="10" REF="8">cannot, on a review of the time and circum&s;tances of the grant, be &s;uppo&s;ed a very extravagant or very ex|traordinary one. If a &s;quare of one hundred miles was not &s;ufficiently large, twice that quantity was as much as could well be expected or &s;olicited: but to &s;uppo&s;e that he, who had caution enough to confine the fir&s;t grant within moderate bounds, &s;hould in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace as three years, &s;upercede it by another grant of many million times greater content, is, on the face of the affair, a cir|cum&s;tantial nullity.</P>
<P>Whether this patent or charter was in exi&s;tence or not at the time the revolution commenced, is a matter I &s;hall hereafter &s;peak to, and confine my&s;elf in this place to the limits which the &s;aid patent or charter lays down.</P>
<P>The words are as follow:
<Q>Beginning from the cape or point of land called cape or point Comfort, thence all along the &s;ea coa&s;t to the NORTHWARD 200 miles; and from the &s;aid point or cape Comfort all along the &s;ea coa&s;t to the <HI>&s;outh-ward</HI> 200 miles; and all that &s;pace or circuit of land lying from the &s;ea coa&s;t of the precinct afore&s;aid up into the land throughout, from &s;ea to &s;ea, WEST and <HI>north|we&s;t.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t remark I &s;hall offer on the words of this grant is, that they are uncertain, ob&s;cure and unintelligible, and may be con&s;trued into &s;uch a variety of contradicto|ry meanings as to leave at la&s;t no meaning at all.</P>
<P>Whether the 200 miles each way, from cape Comfort, were to be on a <HI>&s;traight</HI> line, or a&s;certained by following the indented <HI>line of the coa&s;t,</HI> that is, <HI>"all along the &s;ea coa&s;t,"</HI> in and out as the coa&s;t lay, cannot now be fully determi|ned; becau&s;e, as either will admit of &s;uppo&s;ition, and nothing but &s;uppo&s;ition can be produced, therefore neither can be taken as po&s;itive. Thus far may be &s;aid, that had it been intended to be a &s;traight line, the word <HI>&s;traight</HI> ought to have been in&s;erted, which would have made the matter clear; but as no inference can well be drawn to the advantage of that which does <HI>not appear</HI> again&s;t that which <HI>does,</HI> therefore the omi&s;&s;ion implies negatively in fa|vour of the coa&s;t indented line, or that the 400 miles were to be traced on the windings of the coa&s;t, that is, <HI>"all along the &s;ea coa&s;t."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="9">But what is meant by the words <HI>"we&s;t and north-we&s;t"</HI> is &s;till more unintelligible. Whether they mean a we&s;t line and a north-we&s;t line, or whether they apply to the general lying of the land from the Atlantic, without re|gard to lines, cannot again be determined. But if they are &s;uppo&s;ed to mean lines to be run, then a new diffi|culty of more magnitude than all the re&s;t ari&s;es; namely, From which end of the extent on the coa&s;t is the we&s;t line and the north-we&s;t line to be &s;et off; as the difference in the content of the grant, occa&s;ioned by tran&s;po&s;ing them is many hundred million of acres; and either includes or excludes a far greater quantity of land than the whole thirteen United States contain?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there is not a boundary in this grant that is clear, fixt and defined. The coa&s;t line is uncertain, and that being the ba&s;e on which the others are to be formed, renders the whole uncertain. But even if this line was admitted, in either &s;hape, the other boundaries would &s;till be on &s;uppo&s;ition, till it might be &s;aid there is no boun|dary at all, and con&s;equently no charter; for words which de&s;cribe nothing can give nothing.</P>
<P>The advocates for the Virginia claim, laying hold of the&s;e ambiguities, have explained the grant thus:</P>
<P>Four hundred miles on the &s;ea coa&s;t, and from the &s;outh point a we&s;t line to the great &s;outh &s;ea, and from the north point a north-we&s;t line to the &s;aid &s;outh &s;ea. The figure which the&s;e lines produce will be thus:
<FIGURE>

<P>Cape Comfort.</P>
<P>200 N.</P>
<P>North-we&s;t line endle&s;s.</P>
<P>New York. New England.</P>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="10">But why, I a&s;k, mu&s;t the we&s;t land line be &s;et off from the &s;outh point, any more than from the north point? The grant or patent does not &s;ay from which it &s;hall be, neither is it clear that a line is the thing intended by the words: but admitting it is, on what grounds do the claimants proceed in making this choice? the an&s;wer, I pre&s;ume, is ea&s;ily given, namely, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t beneficial explanation to them&s;elves they can po&s;&s;ibly make; as it takes in many thou&s;and times more extent of country than any other explanation would. But this, tho' it be a very good rea&s;on to them, is a very bad rea|&s;on to us; and tho' it may do for the claimants to hope upon, will not an&s;wer to plead upon; e&s;pecially to the very people, who, to confirm the partiality of the claimants choice, mu&s;t relinqui&s;h their own right and in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>Why not &s;et off the we&s;t land line from the north end of the coa&s;t line, and the north-we&s;t line from the &s;outh end of the &s;ame? there is &s;ome rea&s;on why this &s;hould be the con&s;truction and none why the other &s;hould.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, becau&s;e, if the line of two hundred miles each way from cape Comfort, be traced by following the in|dented line of the coa&s;t, which &s;eems to be the implied intention of the words, and a we&s;t line be &s;et off from the north end, and a north-we&s;t line from the &s;outh end, the&s;e lines will all unite, (which the other con&s;truction never can) and form a compleat triangle, the content of which will be about twenty nine or thirty millions of acres, or &s;omething larger than Penu&s;ylvania: and</P>
<P>Secondly, becau&s;e this con&s;truction is following the or|der of the lines as expre&s;&s;ed in the grant; for the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> mentioned <HI>coa&s;t</HI> line, which is that to the <HI>northward</HI> of cape Comfort, and the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> mentioned <HI>land</HI> line, which is the <HI>we&s;t</HI> line, have a numerical relation, being the <HI>fir&s;t menti|oned of each;</HI> and implies, that the <HI>we&s;t</HI> line was to be &s;et off from the <HI>north</HI> point and <HI>not</HI> from the &s;outh point: and con&s;equently the two <HI>la&s;t</HI> mentioned of each have the &s;ame numerical relation, and again implies that the <HI>north-we&s;t</HI> line was to be &s;et off from the <HI>&s;outh</HI> point, and <HI>not</HI> from the <HI>north</HI> point. But why the claimants &s;hould break thro' the order of the lines, and, contrary to implicati|on, join the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> mentioned of the <HI>one,</HI> to the <HI>la&s;t</HI> menti|oned of the <HI>other,</HI> and thereby produce a &s;hapele&s;s mon|&s;ter,
<PB N="13" REF="11">for which there is no name nor any parallel in the world, either as to extent of &s;oil or &s;overeignty, is a con&s;truction that cannot be &s;upported.</P>
<P>The figure produced by following the order of the lines is as under.</P>
<P>N. B. If the reader will ca&s;t his eye again over the words of the patent on page 10 he will perceive the na|merical relation alluded to, by ob&s;erving, that the fir&s;t mentioned coa&s;t line and the fir&s;t mentioned land line are di&s;tingui&s;hed by CAPITALS. And the la&s;t mentioned of each by <HI>italics,</HI> which I have cho&s;en to do to illu&s;trate the explanation.</P>

<P>I pre&s;ume that if four hundred miles be traced by fol lowing the in&s;lexes of any &s;ea &s;hore, that the two ex|tremes will not be more than three hundred miles di&s;tant from each other, on a &s;traight line. Therefore to find the content of a triangle who&s;e ba&s;e is three hundred miles, multiply the length of the ba&s;e into half the per|pendicular, which, in this ca&s;e is the we&s;t line, and the product will be the an&s;wer:</P>

<P>Now will any one undertake to &s;ay, that this explana|tion is not as fairly drawn, (if not more &s;o) from the words them&s;elves, as any other that can be offered, be|cau&s;e it is not only ju&s;tified by the exact words of the pa|tent, grant, or charter, or any other name by which it may be called, but by their implied meaning; and is like|wi&s;e of &s;uch a content, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been intended; whereas the claimants explanation is without bounds, and beyond every thing that is rea&s;onable. Yet after all, who can &s;ay what were the preci&s;e meaning of terms and expre&s;&s;ions &s;o loo&s;ely formed, and capable of &s;uch a variety of contradictory interpretations?</P>
<P>Had the order of the lines been otherwi&s;e than they are in the patent, the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the thing mu&s;t have directed the manner in which they &s;hould be con|nected: but as the claim is founded in unrea&s;onablene&s;s, and that unrea&s;onablene&s;s endeavoured to be &s;upported by a tran&s;po&s;ition of the lines, there remains no pretence for the claim to &s;tand on.</P>
<P>Perhaps tho&s;e who are intere&s;ted in the claimants ex|planation will &s;ay, that as the &s;outh &s;ea is &s;poken of, the lines mu&s;t be as they explain them, in order to reach it.</P>
<P>To this I reply; fir&s;t, that no man then knew how far it was from the Atlantic to the &s;outh &s;ea, as I &s;hall pre|&s;ently &s;how, but believed it to be but a &s;hort di&s;tance: and,</P>
<P>Secondly, that the uncertain and ambiguous manner in which the &s;outh fea is alluded to, (for it is not men|tioned
<PB REF="15">by name, but only "<HI>from &s;ea to &s;ea</HI>") &s;erves to perplex the vatent, and not to explain it: and as no right can be founded on an arobiguity, but on &s;ome proof clear|ed of ambiguity, therefore the allu&s;ive introduction of "&s;ea to &s;ea," can yield no &s;ervice to the claim.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e an ambiguous mention made of <HI>two lands</HI> in this patent, as well as of two <HI>&s;eas;</HI> viz. "and all that <Q><HI>&s;pace or circuit of land</HI> lying from the &s;ea coa&s;t of the precinct ofore&s;aid up into the <HI>land throughout from &s;ea to &s;ea.</HI></Q></P>
<P>On which I remark, that the two <HI>lauds</HI> here mentioned have the appearance of a major and a minor, or the great|or out of which the le&s;s is to be taken: and the term from <HI>"&s;ea to &s;ea"</HI> may be &s;aid to apply de&s;criptively to the <HI>land throughout,</HI> and not to the <HI>&s;pace or circuit of land patent|ed to the company:</HI> in a &s;imilar manner that the former pa|tent de&s;cribed a major of 760 miles extent, out of which the minor, or &s;quare of one hundred miles, was to be cho&s;en.</P>
<P>But to &s;uppo&s;e, that becau&s;e the &s;outh &s;ea is darkly al|luded to, it mu&s;t therefore, (at whatever di&s;tance it might be, which then nobody knew, or for whatever purpo&s;e it might be introduced) be made a certain boundary, and that without regard to the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the matter, or the order in which the lines are arranged, which is the only implication the patent gives for &s;etting off the land lines, is a &s;uppo&s;ition that contradicts every thing which is rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>The figure produced by following the order of the lines will be compleat in it&s;elf, let the di&s;tance to the &s;outh &s;ea be more or le&s;s: becau&s;e, if the <HI>land throughout from &s;ea to &s;ea</HI> had not been &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive to admit the we&s;t land line and the north-we&s;t land line to clo&s;e, the &s;outh &s;ea, it that ca&s;e, would have eventually become a boundary: but if the extent of the <HI>land throughout from &s;ea to &s;ea,</HI> was &s;o great, that the lines clo&s;ed without reaching the &s;aid &s;outh &s;ea, the figure was compleat without it.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as the order of the lines, when rai&s;ed on the indented coa&s;t line, produces a regular figure of rea|&s;onable dimen&s;ions, and of about the &s;ame content, tho'

<PB N="16" REF="18">not of the &s;ame &s;hape, which Virginia now holds within the Allegany Mountains; and by tran&s;po&s;ing them another &s;igure is produced, for which there is no name, and can|not be compleated, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently explain, and of an extent greater than one half of Europe, it is needle&s;s to offer any other arguments to &s;hew that the order of the lines mu&s;t be the rule, if any rule can be drawn from the words, for a&s;certaining from which point the we&s;t line and north-we&s;t line were to be &s;et off. Neither is it po&s;|&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e any other rule could be followed; becau&s;e a north-we&s;t line &s;et off two hundred miles above cape Comfort, would not only never touch the &s;outh &s;ea, but would form a &s;piral line or infinite windings round the globe, and after pa&s;&s;ing over the northern parts of Ame|rica and the frozen ocean, and then into the northern parts of A&s;ia, would, when eternity &s;hould end and not before, terminate in the north pole.</P>
<P>This is the only manner in which I can expre&s;s the ef|fect of a north-we&s;t line, &s;et off as above; becau&s;e as its direction mu&s;t always be between the north and the we&s;t, it con&s;equently can never get into the pole nor yet come to a re&s;t; and on the principle, that matter or &s;pace is capable of being eternally divided, mu&s;t proceed on for ever.</P>
<P>But it was a prevailing opinion, at the time this patent was obtained, that the South &s;ea was at no great di&s;tance from the Atlantic, and therefore it was needle&s;s, under that &s;uppo&s;ition, to regard which way the lines &s;hould be run; neither need we wonder at this error in the Engli&s;h government re&s;pecting America then, when we &s;ee &s;o ma|ny and &s;uch glaring ones now, for which there are le&s;s excu&s;e.</P>
<P>Some circum&s;tances favoured this mi&s;take. Admiral &s;ir Francis Drake not long before this, had, from the top of a mountain in the I&s;thmus of Darien, which is the cen|ter of North and South America, &s;een both the South &s;ea and the Atlantic; the width of the part of the continent where he then was, not being above 70 miles, whereas its width oppo&s;ite Che&s;apeak-bay is as great, if not greater, than in any other part, being from <HI>&s;ea to &s;ea,</HI> about the di&s;tance it is from America to England. But this could not then be known, becau&s;e only two voyages had been
<PB N="17" REF="19">made acro&s;s the South &s;ea; the one by the &s;hip in which Magellan &s;ailed, who died in his pa&s;&s;age, and which was the fir&s;t &s;hip that failed round the world, and the other by &s;ir Francis Drake: but as neither of the&s;e &s;ailed into a northern latitude in that ocean, high enough to fix the longitude of the we&s;tern coa&s;t of America from the ea&s;t|ern; the di&s;tance acro&s;s was intirely on &s;uppo&s;ition, and the errors they then ran into appear laughable to us who now know what the di&s;tance is.</P>
<P>That the company expected to come at the South &s;ea without much trouble or travelling, and that the great body of land which intervened, &s;o far from being their view in obtaining the charter, became their di&s;appoint|ment, may be collected from a circum&s;tance mentioned in Stith's hi&s;tory of Virginia.</P>
<P>He relates, that, in the year 1608, which was at the time the company were &s;oliciting this patent, they fitted up in England "a barge for captain Newport," (who was afterwards one of the joint deputy governors under the very charter we are now treating of) <Q>which, for convenience of carriage, might be taken into five piec|es, and with which he and his company were in&s;truct|ed to go up James River as far as the falls thereof, to di&s;cover the country of the Monakins, and from thence they were to proceed, <HI>carrying their barge beyond the falls to convey them to the &s;outh &s;ea;</HI> being ordered not to re|turn without a lump of gold, or a certainty of the &s;aid &s;ea.</Q></P>
<P>And Hutchin&s;on, in his hi&s;tory of New England, which was called North-Virginia at the time this patent was ob|tained, &s;ays, <Q>the geography of this part of America was le&s;s under&s;tood than at pre&s;ent. A line to the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements was imagined much &s;horter than it really was. Some of Champlain's people, in the be|ginning of the la&s;t century, who had been but a few days march from Quebec, returned with great joy, &s;uppo&s;ing that from the top of a high mountain they had <HI>di&s;covered the South-Sea.</HI></Q></P>
<P>From the&s;e matters, which are evidences on record, it appears that the adventurers had no knowledge of the di&s;tance it was to the South-Sea, but &s;uppo&s;ed it to be no
<PB N="18" REF="20">great way from the Atlantic; and al&s;o, that great extent of territory was not their object, but a &s;hort communication with the &s;outhern ocean, by which they might get into the neighbourbood of the Gold Coa&s;t, and likewi&s;e carry on a commerce with the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn the confu&s;ed and various interpre|tations this charter is &s;ubject to, and that it may be made to mean any thing and nothing; I now proceed to &s;how, that, let the limits of it be more or le&s;s, the pre&s;ent Vir|ginia does not, and cannot, as a matter of right, inherit under it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall open this part of the &s;ubject by putting the fol|lowing ca&s;e:</P>
<P>Either Virginia &s;tands in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the London com|pany, to whom the charter was granted, or to the Crown of England. If to the London company, then it becomes her, as an out&s;et in the matter, to &s;hew who they were, and likewi&s;e that they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at the commence|ment of the revolution.&mdash;If to the Crown, then the char|ter is of con&s;equence &s;uper&s;eded; becau&s;e the Crown did not po&s;&s;e&s;s territories by charter, but by prerogative with|out charter. The notion of the Crown chartering to it&s;elf is a nullity; and in this ca&s;e, the unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed lands, be they little or much, are in the &s;ame condition as if they never had been chartered at all; and the &s;overeignty of them devolves to the &s;overeignty of the United States.</P>
<P>The charter or patent of 1609 as well as that of 1606 was to Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Summers, the re|verend Richard Hackluit, prebend of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and others; and the government was then proprietary. Tho&s;e proprietors, by virtue of the charter of 1609, cho&s;e Lord Delaware for their governor, and Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Summers, and captain Newport, (the per&s;on who was to go with a boat to the South &s;ea, joint deputy go|vernors.</P>
<P>Was this the form of government either as to &s;oil or con&s;titution at the time the pre&s;ent revolution commen|ced? if not, the charter was not in <HI>being;</HI> for it matters not to us how it came to be <HI>out of being,</HI> &s;o long as the pre|&s;ent Virginians, or their ance&s;tors, neither are nor were &s;ufferers by the change then made.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">But &s;uppo&s;e it could be proved to be in being, which it cannot, becau&s;e <HI>being</HI> in a charter is power, it would only prove a right in behalf of the London company of adven|turers, but how that right is to be di&s;po&s;ed of is another que&s;tion. We are not defending the right of the London company decea&s;ed 150 years ago, but taking up the mat|ter at the place where we found it, and &s;o far as the au|thority of the Crown of England was exerci&s;ed when the revolution commenced.</P>
<P>The charter was a contract between the Crown of En|gland and tho&s;e adventurers for their own emolument, and not between the Crown and the people of Virginia; and whatever was the occa&s;ion of the contract becoming void, or &s;urrendered up, or &s;uperceded, makes no part of the que&s;tion now. It is &s;ufficient that when the United States &s;ucceeded to &s;overeignty they found no &s;uch con|tract in exi&s;tence or even in litigation. They found Vir|ginia under the authority of the Crown of England, both as to &s;oil and government, &s;ubject to quit-rents to the Crown and not to the company, and had been &s;o for up|wards of 150 years: and that an in&s;trument or deed of writing, of a private nature, as all proprietary contracts are &s;o far as land is concerned, and which is now only hi&s;torically known, and in which Virginia was no party, and to which no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in any line can be proved, and have cea&s;ed for 150 years, &s;hould now be raked from obli|vion and held up as a charter whereon to a&s;&s;ume a right to boundle&s;s territory, and that by a perver&s;ion of the or|der of it, is &s;omething very &s;ingular and extraordinary.</P>
<P>If there was any innovation on the part of the crown, the conte&s;t re&s;ted between the crown and the proprietors, the London company, and not between Virginia and the &s;aid crown. It was not her charter; it was the compa|ny's charter, and the only parties in the ca&s;e were the crown and the company.</P>
<P>But why, if Virginia contends for the immutability of charters, has &s;he &s;elected this in preference to the two former ones? All her arguments ari&s;ing from this prin|ciple mu&s;t go to the fir&s;t charter and not to the la&s;t; but by placing them to the la&s;t, in&s;tead of the fir&s;t, &s;he ad|mits a fact again&s;t her principle; becau&s;e, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the la&s;t, &s;he proves the fir&s;t to be vacated by the
<PB N="20" REF="22">&s;econd in the &s;pace of 23 years, the &s;econd to be vacated by the third in the &s;pace of 3 years; and why the third &s;hould not be vacated by the fourth form of government, i&s;&s;uing from the &s;ame power with the former two, and which took place about 25 years after, and continued in being for 150 years &s;ince, and under which all her public and private bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted, her purcha&s;es made, her warrants for &s;urvey and patents for land obtained, is too my&s;terious to account for.</P>
<P>Either the re-a&s;&s;umption of the London company's char|ter into the hands of the crown was an u&s;urpation, or it was not. If it was, then, &s;trictly &s;peaking, is every thing which Virginia has done under that u&s;urpation il|legal, and &s;he may be &s;aid to have lived in the mo&s;t curious &s;pecies of rebellion ever known; rebellion again&s;t the Lon|don company of adventurers. For if the charter to the company (for it was not to the Virginians) ought to be in being now, it ought to have been in being then; and why &s;he &s;hould admit its vacation then, and reject it now, is unaccountable; or why &s;he &s;hould e&s;teem her purcha|&s;es of lands good which were <HI>then</HI> made contrary to this charter, and now contend for the operation of the &s;ame charter to po&s;&s;e&s;s new territory by, are circum&s;tances which cannot be reconciled.</P>
<P>But whether the charter, as it is called, ought to be extinct or not, cannot make a que&s;tion with us. All the parties concerned in it are decea&s;ed, and no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in any regular line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, appear to claim. Neither the London company of adventurers, their heirs or a&s;|&s;igns, were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the exerci&s;e of this charter at the commencement of the revolution; and therefore the &s;tate of Virginia does not, in point of fact, &s;ucceed to and inherit from the company.</P>
<P>But &s;ay they, we &s;ucceed to and inherit from the Crown of England, which was the immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of of the &s;overeignty at the time we entered, and had been &s;o for 150 years.</P>
<P>To &s;ay this, is to &s;ay there is no charter at all. A char|ter is an a&s;&s;urance from one party to another, and cannot be from the &s;ame party to it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">But before I enter further on this ca&s;e I &s;hall conci&s;ely &s;tate how this charter came to be re-a&s;&s;umed by the pow|er which granted it, the Crown of England.</P>
<P>I have already &s;tated that it was a proprietary charter, or grant, to &s;ir Thomas Gates and others, who were cal|led the London company, and &s;ometimes the South-Vir|ginia company, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e who &s;et|tled to the ea&s;tward (now New-England) and were then called the North-Virginia or Plymouth company.</P>
<P>Oldmixon's hi&s;tory of Virginia (in his account of the Briti&s;h empire in America) publi&s;hed in the year 1708, gives a conci&s;e progre&s;s of the affair. He attributes it to the mi&s;conduct, contentions and mi&s;management of the proprietors, and their innovations upon the Indians, which had &s;o exa&s;perated them, that they fell on the &s;et|tlers and de&s;troyed at one time 334 men, women, and child|ren.</P>
<P>"Some time after this ma&s;&s;acre, &s;ays he, &s;everal gen|tlemen in England procured grants of land from the com|pany, and others came over on their private accounts to make &s;ettlements; among the former was one captain Martin, who was named to be of the council. This man rai&s;ed &s;o many differences among them, that new di&s;trac|tions followed, which the Indians ob&s;erving, took heart and once more fell upon the &s;ettlers on the borders, de|&s;troying, without pitying either age, &s;ex, or condition.</P>
<P>"The&s;e and other calamities, being chiefly imputed to the mi&s;management of the proprietors, who&s;e lo&s;&s;es had &s;o di&s;couraged mo&s;t of their be&s;t members, that they &s;old their &s;hares, and Charles the fir&s;t on his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne di&s;&s;olved the company, and took the colony into his own immediate direction. He appointed the gover|nor and council him&s;elf, ordered all patents and proce&s;s to i&s;&s;ue in his own name, and re&s;erved a quit-rent of two &s;hillings &s;terling for every hundred acres."</P>
<P>Thus far our author. Now it is impo&s;&s;ible for us at this di&s;tance of time to &s;ay what were all the exact cau|&s;es of the change; neither have we any bu&s;ine&s;s with it. The company might &s;urrender it, or they might not, or they might forfeit it by not fulfilling conditions, or they
<PB N="22" REF="24">might &s;ell it, or the Crown might, as far as we know, take it from them. But what are either of the&s;e ca&s;es to Virginia, or any other which can be produced. She was not a party in the matter. It was not her charter, nei|ther can &s;he ingraft any right upon it or &s;uffer any inju|ry under it.</P>
<P>If the charter was vacated it mu&s;t have been by the London company; if it was &s;urrendered it mu&s;t be by the &s;ame; If it was &s;old nobody el&s;e could &s;ell it, and if it was taken from them nobody el&s;e could lo&s;e it; and yet Virginia calls this her charter, which it was not within her power to hold, to &s;ell, to vacate, or to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>But if &s;he puts her right upon the ground that it never was &s;old, &s;urrendered, lo&s;t, or vacated, by the London company, &s;he admits that if they <HI>had</HI> &s;old, &s;urrendered, lo&s;t, or vacated it, that it would have become extinct, and to her no charter at all. And in this ca&s;e, the only thing to prove is the fact, which is, Has this charter been the rule of government, and of purcha&s;ing or procuring unappropriated lands in Virginia, from the time it was granted to the time of the revolution? An&s;wer, the char|ter has not been the rule of government, nor of purcha|&s;ing or procuring lands, neither has any lands been pur|cha&s;ed or procured under its &s;anction or authority for upwards of 150 years.</P>
<P>But if &s;he goes a &s;tep further, and &s;ay that they could not vacate, &s;urrender, &s;ell, or lo&s;e it, by any act they could do, &s;o neither could they vacate, &s;urrender, &s;ell, or lo&s;e that of 1606, which was three years prior to this; and this argument, &s;o far from e&s;tabli&s;hing the charter of 1609, would de&s;troy it; and in its &s;tead confirm the preceding one which limited the company to a &s;quare of 100 miles. And if &s;he &s;till goes back to that of &s;ir Wal|ter Rawleigh, <HI>that</HI> only places her in the light of Ameri|cans in common with all.</P>
<P>The only fact that can be clearly proved, is, that the Crown of England exerci&s;ed the power of dominion and government in Virginia, and of the di&s;po&s;al of the lands, and that the charter had neither been the rule of govern|ment or purcha&s;ing lands for upwards of 150 years, and this places Virginia in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Crown and not to
<PB N="23" REF="25">the Company. Con&s;equently it proves a lap&s;e of the char|ter into the hands of the crown by &s;ome means or other.</P>
<P>Now to &s;uppo&s;e that the charter could return into the hands of the crown and yet remain in force, is to &s;uppo&s;e that a man could be bound by a bond of obligation to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Its very <HI>being</HI> in the hands of the crown from which it i&s;&s;ued is a ce&s;&s;ation of its exi&s;tence; and an effectual un|chartering all that part of the Grant which was not be|fore di&s;po&s;ed of. And con&s;equently the &s;tate of Virginia &s;tanding thus in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, can be intitled to no more extent of country as a &s;tate under the union, than what it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as a province under the crown. And all lands exterior to the&s;e bounds as well of Virginia as the re&s;t of the &s;tates, devolve, in the order of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion to the &s;overeignty of the United States for the benefit of all.</P>
<P>And this brings the ca&s;e to what were the limits of Vir|ginia as a province under the crown of England.</P>
<P>Charter it had none. It's limits then re&s;ted at the di&s;|cretion of the authority to which it was &s;ubje&s;t. Mary|land and Penn&s;ylvania became it's boundary to the ea&s;t|ward and northward and North-Carolina to the &s;outhward, therefore the boundary to the we&s;tward was the only prin|cipal line to be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>As Virginia from a proprietary &s;oil and government was become what then bore the name of a royal one, the extent of the province, as the order of things then &s;tood (for &s;omething mu&s;t always be admitted whereon to form a beginning) was wholly at the di&s;po&s;al of the crown of England, who might enlarge, or dimini&s;h, or erect new governments to the we&s;tward, by the &s;ame authoritative right that Virginia now can divide a county into two; if too large, or too inconvenient.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, as has been &s;aid, that Penn&s;ylvania, Maryland and North Carolina, were taken out of Virginia, is no more than to &s;ay, they were taken out of America; be|cau&s;e Virginia was the common name of all the country, north and &s;outh: and to &s;ay they were taken out of the chartered limits of Virginia, is likewi&s;e to &s;ay nothing;
<PB N="24" REF="26">becau&s;e after the di&s;&s;olution or extinction of the proprieta|ry company, there was nobody to whom any provincial limits became chartered. The extinction of the compa|ny was the extinction of the chartered limits. The pa|tent could not &s;urvive the company, becau&s;e it was to them a right, which, when they expired cea&s;ed to be any body's el&s;e in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>But to return to the we&s;tern boundary of Virginia at the commencement of the revolution.</P>
<P>Charters, like proclamations, were the &s;ole act of the crown, and if the former were adequate to fix limits to the lands which it gave away, &s;old, or otherways di&s;po&s;|ed of, the latter were equally adequate to fix limits or divi&s;ions to tho&s;e which it retained; and therefore, the we&s;tern limits of Virginia, as the proprietary company was extinct and con&s;equently the patent with it, mu&s;t be looked for in the line of proclamations.</P>
<P>I am not fond of quoting the&s;e old remains of former arrogance, but as we mu&s;t begin &s;omewhere, and as the &s;tates have agreed to regulate the right of each &s;tate to territory, by the condition each &s;tood in with the crown of England at the commencement of the revolution, we have no other rule to go by; and any rule which can be agreed on is better than none.</P>
<P>From the proclamation then of 1763, the we&s;tern li|mits of Virginia, as a province under the crown of Eng|land, are de&s;cribed &s;o as not to extend beyond the heads of any of the rivers which empty them&s;elves into the Atlantic, and con&s;equently the limits did not pa&s;s over the Allegany Mountain.</P>
<P>Extract from the proclamation of 1763 &s;o far as re&s;pects boundary:</P>
<P>"AND WHEREAS it is <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onable,</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ential to our intere&s;t,</HI> and the &s;ecurity of our colonies, that the &s;everal nations or tribes of Indians, with whom we are connected, and who live under our protection, &s;hould not be mole&s;ted or di&s;turbed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch parts of our dominions and territories, <HI>as, not hav|ing been ceded to or purcha&s;ed by us, are re&s;erved to them or any of them as their hunting grounds;</HI> we do therefore, with the advice of our privy council, declare it to be our roy|al
<PB N="25" REF="27">will and plea&s;ure, that no governor, or commander in chief, in any of our colonies of Quebec, ea&s;t Florida, or we&s;t Florida, do pre&s;ume, upon any pretence what|ever, to grant warrants of &s;urvey, or pa&s;s any patents for lands beyond the bounds of their re&s;pective govern|ments, as de&s;cribed in their commi&s;&s;ions; As ALSO that no governor or commander in chief of our other colonies or plantations in America, do pre&s;ume, for the pre&s;ent, and until our further plea&s;ure be known, to grant war|rants of &s;urvey, or pa&s;s patents for any lands <HI>beyond the heads or &s;ources of any of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic ocean from the we&s;t or north-we&s;t,</HI> or upon any lands what|ever, <HI>which not having been ceded to, or purcha&s;ed by us, as afore&s;aid, are re&s;erved unto the &s;aid Indians or any of them.</HI></P>
<P>"And we do further declare it to be our royal will and plea&s;ure, for the pre&s;ent, as afore&s;aid, to re&s;erve under our &s;overeignty, protection, and dominion, <HI>for the u&s;e of the &s;aid Indians all the lands and territories,</HI> not includ|ed within the limits of our &s;aid three new governments, or within the limits of the territory granted to the Hud|&s;on's-Bay company; as al&s;o, <HI>all the lands and territories lying to the we&s;tward of the &s;ources of the rivers, which fall into the &s;ea from the we&s;t and north-we&s;t as afore&s;aid;</HI> and we do hereby &s;trictly forbid, on pain of our di&s;plea&s;ure, all our loving &s;ubjects from making any purcha&s;es or &s;ettlements whate|ver, or taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any of the lands above re&s;erved, without our e&s;pecial leave and licence for that purpo&s;e fir&s;t obtained:</P>
<P>"And we do further &s;trictly enjoin and require all per&s;ons whatever, who have either wilfully or inadvertently &s;eated them&s;elves upon any lands within the countries above de&s;cribed, or upon any other lands, <HI>which, not hav|ing been ceded to, or purcha&s;ed by us,</HI> are &s;till re&s;erved to the &s;aid Indians, as afore&s;aid, forthwith to remove them|&s;elves from &s;uch &s;ettlements."</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y for us to under&s;tand, that the frequent and plau&s;ible mention of the Indians was only &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s to create an idea of the humanity of government. The ob|ject and intention of the proclamation was the we&s;tern boundary, which is here &s;ignified not to extend beyond the heads of the rivers: and the&s;e, then, are the we&s;tern limits which Virginia had as a province under the crown of Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28">And agreeable to the intention of this proclamation and the limits de&s;cribed thereby, lord Hil&s;borough, then &s;ecretary of &s;tate in England, addre&s;&s;ed an official letter of the 31&s;t of July, 1770, to lord Bottetourt, at that time governor of Virginia, which letter was laid before the council of Virginia by Mr. pre&s;ident Nel&s;on, and by him an&s;wered on the 18th of October in the &s;ame year, of which the following are extracts:</P>
<P>"On the evening of the day your lord&s;hip's letter to the governor was delivered to me, and as it contains matters of great variety and importance, it was read in council, and, together with the &s;everal papers inclo&s;ed, it hath been maturely con&s;idered, and I now trouble your lord&s;hip with theirs as well as my own opinion upon the &s;ubject of them.</P>
<P>"We do not pre&s;ume to &s;ay to whom our gracious &s;o|vereign &s;hall grant his vacant lands," and "with re&s;pect to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a <HI>new colony on the back of Virginia,</HI> it is a &s;ubject of too great political importance for me to pre&s;ume to give an opinion upon, however, permit me, my lord, to ob&s;erve, that when that part of the country &s;hall become &s;ufficiently populated it may be a wi&s;e and prudent mea&s;ure."</P>
<P>On the death of lord Bottetourt, lord Dunmore was appointed to the government, and he, either from igno|rance of the &s;ubject, or other motives, made a grant of &s;ome lands on the Ohio to certain of his friends and favo|rites, which produced the following letter from lord Dart|mouth, who &s;ucceeded lord Hil&s;borough as &s;ecretary of &s;tate:</P>
<P>"I think fit to inclo&s;e your lord&s;hip a copy of lord Hil&s;borough's letter to lord Bottetourt, of the 31&s;t of Ju|ly, 1770, the receipt of which was acknowledged by Mr. pre&s;ident Nel&s;on, a few days after lord Bottetourt's death, and appears by his an&s;wer to it, to have been laid before the council. That board, therefore, could not be igno|rant of what has pa&s;&s;ed here upon Mr. Walpole's applica|tion, nor of the king's expre&s;s command, contained in lord Hil&s;borough's letter, that no lands &s;hould be granted beyond the limits of the royal proclamation of 1763, un|til the king's further plea&s;ure was &s;ignified; and I have
<PB N="27" REF="29">only to ob&s;erve, that it mu&s;t have been a very extraordi|nary neglect in them not to have informed your lord&s;hip of that letter and tho&s;e orders."</P>
<P>On the&s;e documents I &s;hall make no remarks. They are their own evidence, and &s;hew what the limits of Vir|ginia were while a Briti&s;h province; and as there was then no other authority by which they could be fixed, and as the grant to the London company could not be a grant to any but them&s;elves, and of con&s;equence cea&s;ed to be when they cea&s;ed to exi&s;t, it remained a matter of choice in the crown, on its re-a&s;&s;umption of the lands, to limit or divide them into &s;eparate governments, as it judged be&s;t, and from which there was not, and could not in the order of government, be any appeal. Neither was Virginia, as a province, affected by it, becau&s;e the mo|nies, in any ca&s;e, ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of lands, did not go into her trea&s;ury; and whether to the crown or to the proprietors was to her indifferent. And it is likewi&s;e e|vident, from the &s;ecretary's letter, and the pre&s;ident's an&s;wer, that it was in contemplation to lay out a new colony on the <HI>back</HI> of Virginia, between the Allegany Mountains and the Ohio.</P>
<P>Having thus gone thro' the &s;everal charters, or grants, and their relation to each other, and &s;hewn that Virginia cannot &s;tand in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to a private Grant, which has been extinct for upwards of 150 years; and that the we&s;tern limits of Virginia, at the commence|ment of the revolution, were at the heads of the rivers emptying them&s;elves into the Atlantic, none of which are beyond the Allegany Mountains; I now proceed to the &s;econd part, namely,</P>
<P>The rea&s;onablene&s;s of her claims:</P>
<P>Virginia, as a Briti&s;h province, &s;tood in a different &s;i|tuation with the crown of England to any of the other provinces, becau&s;e &s;he had no a&s;certained limits, but &s;uch as aro&s;e from the laying off new provinces and the proclamation of 1763. For the name, Virginia, as I have before mentioned, was the general name of all the country, and the dominion out of which the &s;everal go|vernments were laid off: and in &s;trict propriety, con|formable to the origin of names, the province of Virgi|ginia
<PB N="28" REF="30">was taken out of the dominion of Virginia. For the term, <HI>dominion,</HI> could not appertain to the province, which retained the name of Virginia, but to the crown, and from thence was applied to the whole country, and &s;ignified its being an appendage to the crown of England, as they now &s;ay <HI>"our dominion of Wales."</HI></P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e there could exi&s;t an idea, that Virginia, as a Briti&s;h province, was to be extended to the &s;outh &s;ea at the di&s;tance of three thou&s;and miles. The dominion, as appertaining at that time to the crown, might be claimed to extend &s;o far, but as a province the thought was not conceiveable, nor the practice po&s;&s;ible. And it is more than probable, that the deception made u&s;e of to obtain the patent of 1609, by repre&s;enting the fouth &s;ea to be near where the Allegany Mountains are, was one cau&s;e of its becoming extinct; and it is worthy of remarking, that no hi&s;tory (at lea&s;t that I have met with) mentions any di&s;pute or litigation, between the crown and the company in con&s;equence of the extinction of the patent, and the re-a&s;&s;umption of the lands; and therefore the negative evidence corroborating with the po&s;itive, make it, as certain as &s;uch a ca&s;e can po&s;&s;ibly be, that either the company received a compen&s;ation for the patent, or quitted it quietly, a&s;hamed of the im|po&s;ition they had acted, and their &s;ub&s;equent mal-admi|ni&s;tration. Men are not inclined to give up a claim where there is any ground to contend on, and the &s;ilence in which the patent expired is a pre&s;umptive proof that its fate, from whatever cau&s;e, was ju&s;t.</P>
<P>There is one general policy which &s;eems to have pre|vailed with the Engli&s;h in laying off new governments, which was, not to make them larger than their own country, that they might the ea&s;ier hold them manage|able: this was the ca&s;e with every one except Canada, the exten&s;ion of who&s;e limits was for the political pur|po&s;e of recognizing new acqui&s;ition of territory, not im|mediately convenient for colonization.</P>
<P>But, in order to give this matter a chance thro' all its ca&s;es, I will admit what no man can &s;uppo&s;e, which is, that there is an Engli&s;h charter that fixes Virginia to ex|tend from the Atlantic to the &s;outh &s;ea, and contained within a due we&s;t line, &s;et off two hundred miles below
<PB N="29" REF="31">cape Comfort, and a north we&s;t line, &s;et off two hundred miles above it. Her &s;ide, then, on the, atlantic (according to an explanation given in Mr. Brad&s;ord's Paper of Sep|tember 29th, 1779, by an advocate for the Virginia claims) will be four hundred miles; her &s;ide to the &s;outh three thou&s;and; her &s;ide to the we&s;t four thou&s;and; and her north we&s;t line about five thou&s;and; and the quanti|ty of land contained within the&s;e dimen&s;ions will be al|mo&s;t 4,000,000,000, that is, four thou&s;and million of acres, which is more than ten times the quantity contai|ned within the pre&s;ent United States, and above an hun|dred rimes greater than the kingdom of England.</P>
<P>To rea&s;on on a ca&s;e like this is &s;uch a wa&s;te of time, and &s;uch an exce&s;s of &s;olly that it ought not to be rea&s;oned upon. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that any patent to pri|vate per&s;ons could be &s;o intentionally ab&s;urd, and the claim grounded thereon is as wild as any thing the imagi|nation of man ever conceived.</P>
<P>But if, as I before mentioned, there was a charter which bore &s;uch an explanation, and that Virginia &s;tood in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to it, what would that he to us any more than the will of Alexander, had he taken it in his head to have bequeathed away the world? Such a charter or grant mu&s;t have been obtained by impo&s;ition and a fal&s;e repre|&s;entation of the country, or granted in error, or both; and in any of, or all the&s;e ca&s;es, the United States mu&s;t reject the matter as &s;omething they can know nothing of, for the merits will not bear an argument, and the preten|tion of right &s;tands upon no better ground.</P>
<P>Our ca&s;e is an original one; and many matters atten|ding it mu&s;t be determined on their own merits and rea|&s;onablene&s;s. The territory of the re&s;t of the &s;tates is in general within known bounds of moderate extent, and the quota which each &s;tate is to furni&s;h towards the ex|pence and &s;ervice of the war, mu&s;t be a&s;certained upon &s;ome rule of compari&s;on. The number of inhabitants of each &s;tate formed the fir&s;t rule; and it was naturally &s;up|po&s;ed that tho&s;e numbers bore nearly the &s;ame proportion to each other, which the territory of each &s;tate did. Virginia, on this &s;cale, would be about one fifth larger than Penn&s;ylvania, which would be as much dominion as any &s;tate could manage with happine&s;s and convenience.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">When I fir&s;t began this &s;ubject, my intention was to be exten&s;ive on the merits, and conci&s;e on the matter of right; in&s;tead of which, I have been exten&s;ive on the matter of right, and conci&s;e on the merits or rea&s;onable|ne&s;s: and this alteration in my de&s;ign aro&s;e con&s;equenti|ally from the nature of the &s;ubject; for as a rea&s;onable thing the claim can be &s;upported by no argument, and therefore needs none to refute it; but as there is a &s;trange propen&s;ity in mankind to &s;helter them&s;elves un|der the &s;anction of a right, however unrea&s;onable that &s;uppo&s;ed right may be, I found it mo&s;t conducive to the intere&s;t of the ca&s;e, to &s;hew, that the right &s;tands upon no better grounds than the rea&s;on. And &s;hall there|fore proceed to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on</P>
<P>The con&s;equences of the claim.</P>
<P>The claim being unrea&s;onable in it&s;elf and &s;tanding on no ground of right, but &s;uch as, if true, mu&s;t from the quarter it is drawn be offen&s;ive, has a tendency to create di&s;gu&s;t and &s;our the minds of the re&s;t of the &s;tates Tho&s;e lands are capable, under the management of the United States, of repaying the charges of the war, and &s;ome of which, as I &s;hall hereafter &s;how, might, I pre|&s;ume, be made an immediate advantage of.</P>
<P>I di&s;tingui&s;h three different de&s;criptions of lands in America at the commencement of the revolution. Pro|prietary or chartered lands, as was the ca&s;e in Penn&s;yl|vania. Crown lands, within the de&s;cribed limits of any of the crown governments; and crown re&s;iduary lands that were without or beyond the limite of any province; and tho&s;e la&s;t were held in re&s;erve whereon to erect new governments and lay out new provinces; as appears to have been the de&s;ign by lord Hill&s;borough's letter and the pre&s;ident's an&s;wer, wherein he &s;ays <Q>with re&s;pect to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new colony on the <HI>back of</HI> Virginia, it is a &s;ubject of too great political impor|portance for me to pre&s;ume to give an opinion upon; however permit me, my lord, to ob&s;erve, that when that part of the country &s;hall become populated it may bea wi&s;e and prudent mea&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;ion is a <HI>new colony</HI> on the <HI>back</HI> of Virginia"; and referred to lands between the heads of the rivers and
<PB N="31" REF="33">the Ohio. This is a proof that tho&s;e lands were not con|&s;idered within but beyond the limits of Virginia as a co|lony; and the other expre&s;&s;ion in the letter is equally de&s;criptive, namely, <HI>"We do not pre&s;ume to &s;ay to whom "our gracious &s;overeign &s;hall grant his vacant lands".</HI> Cer|tainly then, the &s;ame right, which, at that time, re&s;ted in the crown re&s;ts now in the more &s;upreme authority of the United States; and therefore addre&s;&s;ing the pre|&s;ident's letter to the circum&s;tances of the revolution it will run thus.</P>
<P>We do not pre&s;ume to &s;ay to whom the &s;overeign Unit|ed States &s;hall grant their vacant lands, and with re|&s;pect to the &s;ettlement of a <HI>new colony</HI> on the <HI>back</HI> of Vir|ginia it is a matter of too much political importance for me to give an opinion upon; however, permit me to ob|&s;erve, that when that part of the country &s;hall become peopled it may be a wi&s;e and prudent mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t occur to every per&s;on on reflection that tho&s;e lands are too di&s;tant to be within the government of any of the pre&s;ent &s;tates; and, I may pre&s;ume to &s;uppo&s;e, that were a calculation ju&s;tly made, Virginia has lo&s;t more by the decrea&s;e of taxables than &s;he has gained by what lands &s;he has made &s;ale of; therefore &s;he is not on|ly doing the re&s;t of the &s;tates wrong in point of equity, but her&s;elf and them an injury in point of &s;trength, &s;er|vice and revenue.</P>
<P>It is only the United States, and not any &s;ingle State, that can lay off new &s;tates and incorporate them in the union by repre&s;entation; therefore the &s;ituation which the &s;ettlers on tho&s;e lands will be in, under the a&s;&s;umed right of Virginia, will be hazardous and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and they will feel them&s;elves at la&s;t like alliens to the com|mon wealth of I&s;rael, their habitations un&s;afe and their title precarious.</P>
<P>And when men reflect on that peace, harmony, qui|etude, and &s;ecurity which is nece&s;&s;ary to pro&s;perity, e&s;|pecially in making new &s;ettlements, and think that when the war &s;hall be ended, their happine&s;s and &s;afety will depend on a union with the &s;tates, and not a &s;cattered people, unconnected with, and politically unknown to the re&s;t, they will feel but little inclination to put them|&s;elves
<PB N="32" REF="34">&s;elves in a &s;itnation, which, however &s;olitary and reclu&s;e, it may appear, at pre&s;ent, will then be uncertain and un&s;afe, and their troubles will have to begin where tho&s;e of the United States &s;hall end.</P>
<P>It is probable that &s;ome of the inhabitants of Virginia may be inclined to &s;uppo&s;e, that the writer of this, by taking up the &s;ubject in the manner he has done, is argu|ing unfriendly again&s;t their intere&s;t. To this he wi&s;hes to reply&punc;</P>
<P>That the mo&s;t extraordinary part of the whole is, that Virginia &s;hould countenance &s;uch a claim. For it is wor|thy of ob&s;erving, that, from the beginning of the conte&s;t with Britain, and long after, there was not a people in American who di&s;covered, thro' all the variety and multi|plicity of public bu&s;ine&s;s, a greater fund of true wi&s;dom, fortitude, and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, than the then colony of Virginia. They were loved&mdash;They were reverenced. Their inve&s;tigation of the a&s;&s;umed rights of Britain had a &s;agacity which was uncommon. Their rea&s;onings were piercing, difficult to be equalled and impo&s;&s;ible to be re|futed, and their public &s;pirit was exceeded by none. But &s;ince this unfortunate land &s;cheme has taken place, their powers &s;eem to be ab&s;orbed. A Torpor has over&s;haded them, and every one a&s;ks what is become of Virginia&punc;</P>
<P>It &s;eldom happens that the romantic &s;chemes of exten|&s;ive dominion are of any &s;ervice to a government, and ne|ver to a people. They a&s;&s;uredly end at la&s;t in lo&s;s, trouble, divi&s;ion, and di&s;appointment. And was even the title of Virginia good, and the claim admi&s;&s;ible, &s;he would de|rive more la&s;ting and real benefit by participating it, than by attempting the management of an object &s;o infinitely beyond her reach. Her &s;hare with the re&s;t, under the &s;upremacy of the United States, which is the only au|thority adaquate to the purpo&s;e, would be worth more to her, than what the whole would produce under the ma|nagement of her&s;elf alone, and that for &s;everal rea&s;ons.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Fir&s;t, becau&s;e her claim not being admi&s;&s;ible nor yet manageable, &s;he cannot make a good title to the purcha|&s;ers, and con&s;equently can get but little for the lands.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, becau&s;e the di&s;tance the &s;ettlers will be at from her, will immediately put them out of all govern|ment
<PB N="33" REF="35">and protection, &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as relates to Virgi|nia: and by this means &s;he will render her frontiers a refuge to de&s;peradoes, and a hiding place from ju&s;tice; and the con&s;equence will be perpetual un&s;afety to her own peace and that of the neighbouring &s;tates.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, Becau&s;e her quota of expence for carrying on the war, admitting ber to engro&s;s &s;uch an immen&s;ity of territory, would be greater than &s;he can either &s;upport or &s;upply, and could not be le&s;s, upon a rea&s;onable rule of proportion, than nine tenths of the whole. And</ITEM>
<ITEM>La&s;ty, becau&s;e &s;he mu&s;t &s;ooner or later relinqui&s;h them, and therefore to &s;ee her own intere&s;t wi&s;ely at fir&s;t, is preferable to the alternative of finding it out by misfor|tune at la&s;t.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I have now gone thro' my examination of the claims of Virginia in every ca&s;e which I propo&s;ed; and for &s;everal rea&s;ons wi&s;h the lot had fallen to another per&s;on.</P>
<P>But as this is a mo&s;t important matter, in which all are intere&s;ted, and the &s;ub&s;tantial good of Virginia not injured but promoted, and as few men have lei&s;ure, and &s;till fewer have inclination, to go into intricate inve&s;ti|gation, I have at la&s;t ventured on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the United States to the vacant we&s;tern territory is a right they originally &s;at out upon, and in the pamphlet, <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> I frequently men|tioned tho&s;e lands as a national fund for the benefit of all; therefore, re&s;uming the &s;ubject, where I then left off, I &s;hall conclude with conci&s;ely reducing to &s;y&s;tem what I then only hinted.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t piece, the <HI>Cri&s;is Extraordinary,</HI> I e&s;timated the annual amount of the charge of the war and the &s;upport of the &s;everal governments at two millions pounds &s;terl|ing, and the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment at three quarters of a million, and, by a compari&s;on of the taxes of this coun|try with tho&s;e of England, proved that the whole year|ly expence to us, to defend the country, is but a third of what Britain would have drawn from us by tax|es, had &s;he &s;ucceeded in her attempt to conquer; and our peace e&s;tabli&s;hment only an eighth part; and like|wi&s;e
<PB N="34" REF="36">&s;hewed, that it was within the ability of the &s;tates to carry on the whole of the war by taxation without ha|ving recour&s;e to any other modes or funds. To have a clear idea of taxation is nece&s;&s;ary to every country, and the more funds we can di&s;cover and organize the le&s;s will be the hope of the enemy, and the readier their di&s;po&s;i|tion to peace, which it is now <HI>their</HI> intere&s;t more than <HI>ours</HI> to promote.</P>
<P>I have already remarked that only the United States and not any particular &s;tate can lay off new &s;tates and in|corporate them in the union by repre&s;entation; keeping, therefore, this idea in view, I a&s;k, might not a &s;ub&s;tan|tial fund be quickly created by laying off a new &s;tate, &s;o as to contain between twenty and thirty million of acres, and opening a land office in all the countries in Europe for hard money, and in this country for &s;upplies in kind at a certain price.</P>
<P>The tract of land that &s;eems be&s;t adapted to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e is contained between the Allegany Moun|tain and the river Obio, as far north as the Penn&s;ylva|nia line, thence extending down the &s;aid river to the falls thereof, thence due &s;outh into the latitude of the North-Carolina line, and thence ea&s;t to the Allegany Mountain afore&s;aid.&mdash;I the more readily mention this tract becau&s;e it is fighting the enemy at their own wea|pons, as it includes the &s;ame ground on which a new colony would have been erected for the emolument of the crown of England, as appears by lord Hil&s;borough's and Dartmouth's letters, had not the revolution prevent|ed its being carried into execution.</P>
<P>It is probable there may be &s;ome &s;pots of private pro|perty within this tract, but to incorporate them into &s;ome government will render them more profitable to the owners and the condition of the &s;cattered &s;ettlers more eligible and happy than at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>If twenty millions of acres of this new &s;tate be patent|ed and &s;old at twenty pounds &s;terling per hundred acres they will produce four million pounds &s;terling, which, if applied to continental expences only will &s;upport the war for three years &s;hould Britain be &s;o unwi&s;e to her|&s;elf to pro&s;ecute it again&s;t her own direct intere&s;t and
<PB N="35" REF="37">again&s;t the intere&s;t and policy of all Europe. The &s;eve|ral &s;tates will then have to rai&s;e taxes for their internal government only, and the continental taxes as &s;oon as the fund begins to operate will le&s;&s;en, and if &s;ufficiently productive will cea&s;e.</P>
<P>Lands are the real riches of all the habitable world and the natural funds of America. The funds of other coun|tries are, in general, artificially con&s;tructed; the crea|tures of nece&s;&s;ity and contrivance; dependent upon cre|dit, and always expo&s;ed to hazard and uncertainty. But lands can neither be annihilated nor lo&s;e their value; on the contrary the univer&s;ally ri&s;e with population, and rapidly &s;o, when under the &s;ecurity of effectual govern|ment. But this it is impo&s;&s;ible for Virginia to give, and, therefore, that which is capable of defraying the expen|ces of the empire, will, under the management of any &s;ingle &s;tate, produce only a fugitive &s;upport to wandring individuals.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now enquire into the effects which the laying out a new &s;tate, under the authority of the United States, will have upon Virginia.</P>
<P>It is the very circum&s;tance &s;he ought to and mu&s;t wi&s;h for when &s;he examines the matter thro' all its ca&s;es and con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;ettlers being beyond her reach, and her &s;uppo&s;ed authority over them remaining in her&s;elf, they will appear to her as revolters, and &s;he to them as oppre&s;|&s;ors; and this will produce &s;uch a &s;pirit of mutual di&s;|like that in a little time a total di&s;agreement will take place, to the di&s;advantage of both.</P>
<P>But under the authority of the United States the mat|ter is manageable, and Virginia will be ea&s;ed of a di&s;a|greeable con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, a &s;ale of the lands, continentally, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upporting the expence of the war, will &s;ave her a greater &s;hare of taxes, than what the &s;mall &s;ale &s;he could make her&s;elf, and the &s;mall price &s;he could get for them, would produce.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38">She would likewi&s;e have two advantages which no other &s;tate in the union enjoys, fir&s;t, a frontier &s;tate for her defence again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Indians; and the &s;econd is, that the laying out and peopling a new &s;tate on the back of an old one, &s;ituated as the is, is doubling the quantity of its trade.</P>
<P>The new &s;tate, which is here propo&s;ed to be laid our, may &s;end its exported own the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, but its imports mu&s;t come thro' Che&s;apeak Bay, and con&s;equently Vir|ginia will become the market for the new &s;tate; be|cau&s;e, tho' there is a navigation from it, there is none into it, on account of the rapidity of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi.</P>
<P>There are certain circum&s;tances that will produce cer|tain events whether men think of them or notes. The events do not depend upon thinking, but are the natu|ral con&s;equence of acting; and according to the &s;y&s;tem which Virginia has gone upon, the i&s;&s;ue will be, that &s;he will get involved with the back &s;ettlers in a contention about <HI>rights</HI> till they di&s;pute with her her own claims, and, &s;oured by the contention, will go to any other &s;tate for their commerce; both of which may be prevented, a perfect harmony e&s;tabli&s;hed, the &s;trength of the &s;tates encrea&s;ed, and the expences of the war derrayed, by &s;ettling the matter now on the plan of a general right; and every day it is delayed the difficulty will be encrea&s;|ed and the advantages le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>But if it &s;hould happen, as it po&s;&s;ibly may that the war &s;hould end before the money which the new &s;tate may produce be expended, the remainder of the lands therein may be &s;et apart to reimbur&s;e tho&s;e, who&s;e hou&s;es have been burnt by the enemy, as this is a &s;pecies of &s;uf|fering which it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevent, becau&s;e hou|&s;es are not moveable property: and it ought not to be, that becau&s;e we cannot do every thing, that we ought not to do what we can.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much on the &s;ubject, I think it nece&s;|&s;ary to remark, that the pro&s;pect of a new fund, &s;o far from abating our endeavours in making every immediate provi&s;ion for the &s;upply of the army, ought to quicken us therein; for &s;hould the &s;tates &s;ee it expedient to go upon the mea&s;ure, it will be at lea&s;t a year before it can
<PB N="37" REF="39">be productive. I the more freely mention this, becau&s;e, there is a dangerous &s;pecies of popularity, which, I fear, &s;ome men are &s;eeking from their con&s;tituents by giving them grounds to believe, that if they are elected they will lighten the taxes; a mea&s;ure, which, in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of things, cannot be done without expo&s;ing the country to the ravages of the enemy by di&s;abling the army from defending it.</P>
<P>Where knowledge is a duty ignorance is a crime; and if any man who&s;e duty it was to know better has en|couraged &s;uch an expectation, he has either deceived him&s;elf or them: be&s;ides, no country can be defended without expence, and let any man compare his portion of temporary inconveniences ari&s;ing from taxations, with the real di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the army for the want of &s;up|plies, and the difference is not only &s;ufficient to &s;trike him dumb, but make him thankful that wor&s;e con&s;equences have not followed.</P>
<P>In advancing this doctrine, I &s;peak with an hone&s;t freedom to the country; for as it is their good to be de|fended, &s;o it is their intere&s;t to provide that defence, at lea&s;t, till other funds can be organized.</P>
<P>As the laying out new &s;tates will &s;ome time or other be the bu&s;ine&s;s of the country, and as it is yet a new bu&s;i|ne&s;s to us; and as the influence of the war has &s;carcely afforded lei&s;ure for reflecting on di&s;tant circum&s;tances, I &s;hall throw together a few hints for facilitating that mea&s;ure, whenever it may be proper for adopting it.</P>
<P>The United States now &s;tanding on the line of &s;ove|reignty, the vacant territory is their property collective|ly, but the per&s;ons by whom it may hereafter be peopled will have an equal right with our&s;elves; and therefore, as new &s;tates &s;hall be laid off and incorporated with the pre&s;ent, they will become partakers of the remaining territory with us who are already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And this con&s;ideration ought to heighten the value of lands to new emigrants; becau&s;e, in making purcha&s;es, they not only gain an immediate property, but become initiated into the right and heir&s;hip of the &s;tates to a property in re&s;erve, which is an additional advantage to what any purcha&s;ers under the late government of England enjoy|ed.</P>

<P>This, experience will be&s;t determine; but at fir&s;t view of the matter it appears thus; That it ought to be im|mediately incorporated into the union on the ground of a family right, &s;uch a &s;tate landing in the line of a younger child of the &s;ame &s;tock; but as new emigrants will have &s;omething to learn when they fir&s;t come to America, and a new &s;tate requiring aid rather than ca|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of giving it, it might be mo&s;t convenient to admit its immediate repre&s;entation into Congre&s;s, there to &s;it, hear, and debate, on all que&s;tions and matters, but not to vote on any till after the expiration of &s;even years.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in this place take the opportunity of renewing a hint which I formerly threw out in the pamphlet <HI>Com|mon Sen&s;e,</HI> and which the &s;everal &s;tates will, &s;ooner or later, &s;ee the convenience, if not the nece&s;&s;icy, of adopt|ing; which is, that of electing a Continental Convention, for the purpo&s;e of forming a Continental Con&s;titution, defining and de&s;cribing the powers and authority of Con|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of entering into treaties, and making peace, they naturally po&s;&s;e&s;s, in behalf of the &s;tates, for their &s;eparate as well as their united good: but the internal controul and dictatorial powers of Congre&s;s are not &s;uf|ficiently defined, and appear to be too much in &s;ome ca|&s;es, and too little in others; and therefore, to have them marked legally out will give additional energy to the whole, and new confidence to the &s;everal parts.</P>
