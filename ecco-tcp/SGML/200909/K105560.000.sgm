<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN &s;uch of the ODES in this publication as extend to greater length were compo&s;ed, it was ob&s;erved, that whatever art might be u&s;ed to diver&s;ify the cadence, there was &s;till &s;omewhat wanting to the delight of the ear. This defect was perceived to be chiefly owing to uniformity of &s;tanza, which protracted to any degree, mu&s;t ever fatigue, as extingui&s;hing the great &s;ource of all plea&s;ure, variety.</P>
<P>To remedy this, a particular &s;eries of &s;tanzas was adopted; in which the two fir&s;t corre&s;pond, and are &s;ucceeded by a third of as different a mea&s;ure as might be. This was thought to an&s;wer every intention propo&s;ed; and appearing to pre&s;ent as per|fect a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds as rime would admit, was called by way of eminence, MELODY.</P>
<P>It was not till this plan was cho&s;en, after trying mo&s;t modifications that rime could allow, that it
<PB REF="3">was con&s;idered that the very model of Pindar was followed. Such authority added to the author's confidence in the perfection of his method, but de|tracted much from the pride of invention, by recal|ling to his memory the real truth, which was, that he had only revived the ancient term, MELOS.</P>
<P>Mr. Congreve has long &s;ince ob&s;erved, in his di&s;|cour&s;e on the Pindaric ode, that the u&s;e of the STROPHE, ANTISTROPHE, and EPODE is ob&s;olete and impertinent. But &s;uch is the &s;uper&s;tition for Antiquity that they are retained to this day, tho' even their ancient u&s;e and origin cannot be a&s;cer|tained. That, as they are commonly u&s;ed, they confine the &s;pirit of the greater modern Ode, with|out adding to its melody mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed. Yet they mu&s;t be retained, becau&s;e they give it regularity! This is the only rea&s;on of mo&s;t modern poets for retaining them. They &s;eldom appear to have ob|&s;erved, that in a long or grand production of the lyric kind, the admi&s;&s;ion of a &s;imilar variety would contribute not a little to the riches of poetry.</P>
<P>To have their full effect the Strophe, Anti&s;trophe, and Epode, or as they are here denominated, the CADENCE, ANTIPHONY, and UNISON, mu&s;t have the property, either of di&s;tinct harmony, or brevity. Every one mu&s;t have ob&s;erved that in the more ele|gant
<PB REF="4">French and Italian odes, there are two di&s;tinct parts in every &s;tanza. The&s;e, like the parts of a Scots tune, vary the mea&s;ure and contribute exceed|ingly to entertain the ear. For example in this &s;tanza of Malherbe,
<Q><L>C'e&s;t en la paix que toutes cho&s;es</L>
<L>Succ&eacute;dent &s;elon nos de&s;irs:</L>
<L>Comme au Printems nai&s;&s;ent les ro&s;es,</L>
<L>En la paix nai&s;&s;ent les plai&s;irs.</L>
<L>Elle met les pompes aux villes;</L>
<L>Donne aux chams les moi&s;&s;ons fertilles;</L>
<L>Et de la maje&s;t&eacute; des loix</L>
<L>Appuyant les pouvoirs &s;upremes,</L>
<L>Fait demeurer les diademes</L>
<L>Fermes &s;ur la te&s;te des Rois.</L></Q> the fir&s;t four lines are of a melody di&s;tinct from the &s;ix la&s;t. This plan was well followed by Mr. Gray in his odes on the Spring, and Eton College. And that he was very &s;en&s;ible of this beauty appears from his ob&s;ervation in&s;erted among the Notes on Mr. Ma&s;on's edition of his Poems. "There is," &s;ays he, <Q>a <HI>tout en&s;emble</HI> of &s;ound as well as of &s;en&s;e in poetical compo&s;ition always nece&s;&s;ary to its per|fection. What is gone before, &s;till dwells upon the ear, and in&s;en&s;ibly harmonizes with the pre|&s;ent line, as in that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fleeting notes
<PB REF="5">which is called melody.</Q> So much for di&s;tinct|ne&s;s of harmony; as to brevity the other requi&s;ite, its effect is obvious.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations the reader will expect that the author has paid a particular regard to his num|bers. He has &s;o. He always con&s;idered harmony as the chief perfection of the ode. Mu&s;ic was in|deed the fir&s;t companion of lyric poetry: and at this day, who would not prefer a carele&s;s production of Dryden, tho' void of every excellence but harmony, to the mo&s;t laboured of Cowley, tho' rendered heavy with the very gold of fancy?</P>
<P>To the Melodies in this Collection &s;ucceed ano|ther &s;pecies of lyric poetry here called SYMPHONIES. By which name it is to be under&s;tood, that the &s;tanza is varied throughout, as the &s;ubject &s;eemed to de|mand an an&s;wering mode.</P>
<P>Dithyrambic Odes, On Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and To Laughter, were likewi&s;e prepared, but are not here given, as there was no occa&s;ion to &s;well the Collec|tion, till the opinion of the public re&s;pecting its merit &s;hould be known.</P>
