<HEAD>THE ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS TREATISE on PRACTICAL SEAMANSHIP, with hints and remarks relating thereto, as mentioned in the contents, is humbly addre&s;&s;ed to all whom the different parts mo&s;tly concern; but more e&s;pecially to young Sea Officers, who u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours, under Provi|dence, to make the knowledge and di&s;charge of their duty in their &s;tations, the principal plea&s;ure and pur&s;uit of their time, which may make them a benefit and not a burden to their country, their friends, and them&s;elves, in their voyage through life.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed, that the improvement of our &s;hips, and the management of them, for many years pa&s;t, has given that remarkable &s;uperiority <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;eamen have over others, on all important occa&s;ions. Yet I have learned from experience, that this art of &s;eaman&s;hip, and its im|portance, is not &s;o generally under&s;tood among&s;t us as it de&s;erves, for one trading part of the nation has, by their practice, the experience the other wants.</P>
<P>SOME men are &s;o devoted to the methods they have been accu&s;tomed to, that they cannot be prevailed upon to try another; others endeavour to try impracticable methods, and attempt to make &s;hips do impo&s;&s;ibilities, &s;uch as to
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
back them a&s;tern clear of a &s;ingle anchor, when the wind is right again&s;t the windward tide, that drives them to windward of their anchors; or to back a &s;hip with &s;ails &s;o &s;et as to prevent her from &s;hooting a-head towards a dan|ger when laid to, or driving broad &s;ide with the wind right again&s;t the tide, not knowing that a &s;hip driving on either tack will always &s;hoot and advance bodily forward, the way her head lies, in &s;pite of any &s;ails that can be &s;et aback; all which, I tru&s;t, will be &s;hewn in their proper places in the following work.</P>
<P>NOT only the above in&s;tances, (by which I have known &s;hips go on &s;hore,) but the whole duty and conduct of &s;ea officers, as far as mentioned in this book, has hitherto been left entirely to the &s;low progre&s;s of experience, by which they, and all concerned with them, are con&s;tantly liable to be great &s;ufferers by mi&s;taken practices in &s;eaman|&s;hip</P>
<P>FREQUENT ob&s;ervations of this defect, induced me to endeavour to fix the be&s;t rules for Practical Seaman&s;hip, that &s;eamen may not be left entirely to learn their duty by their own and other people's misfortunes, which has been the ca&s;e hitherto, but by the experience of others who have gone before them. From all that I have &s;een, in the many different trades that I have been employed in, tho&s;e &s;eamen in the coal and coa&s;ting trade, to the city of <HI>London,</HI> are the mo&s;t perfect in working and managing their &s;hips in narrow, intricate, and difficult channels, and in tide ways; and the &s;eamen in the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> trade are &s;o on the open &s;eas.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="5">I HAVE heard it was &s;aid by the great Doctor <HI>Halley,</HI> that the &s;afety of navigating &s;hips, in his time, depended principally upon three L's, meaning lead, latitude, and lookout. But a late Mathematician, a friend of mine at <HI>Liverpool,</HI> &s;aid, that there was no hidden or unknown principles concerned in the art of building, &s;ailing, work|ing, and managing of &s;hips, but the laws of motion, the pre&s;&s;ure of fluids, and the properties of the leaver, which are all well known to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Philo&s;ophers and Mathe|maticians, and nothing &s;o much de&s;erved their attention and pur&s;uit, to bring this art to its utmo&s;t perfection for the welfare and &s;upport of GREAT BRITAIN.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;ons, and that of the mo&s;t of the u&s;eful arts having been made public, to our great improvement and advantage, emboldens me to publi&s;h this laboured per|formance on this long neglected &s;ubject, which, I mu&s;t own, will appear to great di&s;advantage from the unexpec|ted difficulties I have found, in being a new writer ven|turing to lead the way on &s;o important and exten&s;ive a &s;ub|ject, in this learned critici&s;ing age; but for my imperfec|tions, as a &s;cholar, I hope the Critics will make allowance for my having been early in life at &s;ea as cook of a collier; and having &s;ince then gone through all the mo&s;t active en|terpri&s;ing employments I could meet with, as a &s;eaman, who has done his be&s;t, and who, as an author, would be glad of any remarks candidly pointed out how to improve his defects, if there &s;hould be a demand for a SECOND EDITION.</P>

<HEAD>PRACTICAL SEAMANSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>_AS the elements principally concerned in the manage|ment of &s;hips, are air or wind, and water, I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed in taking the liberty to endeavour to explain what I have learned from others, or know my&s;elf from experience, of the properties of the&s;e fluids, &s;o far as they may concern practical &s;eaman&s;hip.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>On AIR.</HEAD>
<P>IT is enough for our purpo&s;e here to &s;ay, that air in motion which moves &s;hips, is a fluid body, as much as the water they &s;wim in: This is proved from many experiments, and may be perceived from what we &s;ee ordained by the ALL GREAT AUTHOR of nature, in birds, in&s;ects, and all animals that fly, how they float or &s;wim, &s;teer and govern their directions through the air by their wings and tails, upon the &s;ame principles that fi&s;h &s;wim in water.</P>
<P>AND air is proved by experiment to have its weight in air of about &s;eventeen grains to a quart, near the &s;urface of the &s;ea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The weight of air.</NOTE> as a quart ve&s;&s;el when the air is pumped out by an air pump, weighs about &s;eventeen grains le&s;s than when the air is in it; but the air weighs le&s;s and le&s;s in proportion, as it is higher above the &s;urface or level of the &s;ea: And its property is to buoy up or rai&s;e any matter that is lighter than it &s;elf, bulk for bulk, as may be &s;een by &s;moak, &s;team,
<PB N="2" REF="15">
or vapours, ri&s;ing up to certain heights, 'till they come to air that is of the &s;ame weight with them&s;elves, where they float and make mi&s;ts, fogs, or clouds, which darken the &s;ky, and hinders us from &s;eeing any con&s;iderable di&s;tance about us, till they are di&s;per&s;ed or &s;eparated, or fall in rain or &s;now, &amp;c.</P>
<P>CONFINED air in &s;hips de&s;erves particular notice, it often occa&s;ions di&s;ea&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foul air in &s;hips.</NOTE> and &s;ometimes immediate death, as has frequently been the ca&s;e in the pump wells of &s;hips of war; charcoal fires, &amp;c. in clo&s;e places, are dangerous and &s;ometimes fatal; too many people together in clo&s;e places, filth and dirt made and &s;uffered to continue below, fouls the air, therefore every &s;eaman that does not know it &s;hould be told, that by his common breathing he fouls a gallon of air, and requires a gallon of fre&s;h air to breath in every minute; &s;o that for the pre&s;ervation of them&s;elves, they &s;hould not grudge or think much to keep the places where they re&s;t, as clear and clean as things will admit of; and u&s;e every method po&s;&s;ible to keep &s;hips clear of bad air, which becomes proportionably heavier as it becomes more foul, and loo&s;ing its circulating property it naturally de&s;cends to, and &s;tag|nates in the lowe&s;t vacancies, where it ha&s;tens to corruption every thing that is &s;ubject to decay, even the &s;hip and her materials; and much more &s;o the provi&s;ions, which mu&s;t con&s;equently make unhealthy &s;hips.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To get clear of foul air.</NOTE>WHEN foul air in &s;hips proceeds from their being over crowded with people below, which may prove very fatal: to prevent the bad effects of its lying in a &s;hip, I would recommend to keep the pumps con&s;tantly working tho' no water in the &s;hip 'till a lighted candle will burn clear in the bottom of the pump well, where the wor&s;t air lodges, as being the lowe&s;t and greate&s;t vacancy in &s;hip's holds; and all water pumps, will act the part of air pumps, or ventilators, as it is known that the water would not ri&s;e to the &s;ucking pumps, if the air was not fir&s;t pumped out of them. And as <HI>Guinea</HI> &s;hips, whil&s;t the &s;laves are on board, have their large clo&s;e fire furnace &s;tanding nearly over their pump well; how ea&s;y might a &s;hort cop|per pipe, of about four-inch bore, be made to go into an iron nozel in the &s;ide of the furnace, and the other end on to a lead or wooden pipe of near the &s;ame bore, that might be carried down into the pump well by various ways; and as they make their fires for cooking ju&s;t af|ter midnight, which is the time when all the &s;laves are below, and then ventilators are mo&s;t wanted, it is known from experience in &s;hips of war, were &s;uch pipes are u&s;ed, that whil&s;t the fire burne, by its rare|faction, it will draw up and expel a con&s;tant flow of air from the pump
<PB N="3" REF="16">
well; &s;o that by the&s;e means, the lowe&s;t and foule&s;t air may be got out of &s;hips, and the fre&s;h air will naturally circulate and take its place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pre&s;|&s;ure of air.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE power of the airs pre&s;&s;ure on all bodies near the &s;ur|face of the &s;ea, is computed to be about fifteen pounds weight on every &s;quare inch; it pre&s;&s;es every way in all directions, not only downwards, but &s;lanting, &s;ideways, and upwards, as may be &s;een in common without machines for that purpo&s;e, by tho&s;e little round leather &s;uckers (as they are called) u&s;ed by boys at play, which when wet, and clapped upon &s;mooth &s;tones, pre&s;s the air from between the &s;tone and the &s;ucker, then hawling upon the &s;tring, in the middle it makes a &s;mall vacuum or little hollow &s;pace void of air, and the airs pre&s;&s;ure upwards oppo&s;ite to the vacuum, is what the &s;tones are lifted and carried by about the &s;treets.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;&s;ure of the air downwards is known and experienced in many ca&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bad effects the air's pre&s;|&s;ure may have on &s;hips, &amp;c. which ground in mud.</NOTE> and its bad effects are felt upon &s;hips &s;ometimes when they take out a raft port, which they think high enough out of the water when the &s;hip is afloat; but if &s;he after that grounds, by the tide leaving her upon mud, &s;o as to pre&s;s the water from under part of the bottom, the airs pre&s;&s;ure downwards again&s;t that part in the mud, where there is neither air nor water, will confine the &s;hip from ri&s;ing out of the mud 'till the water flows much above her floating mark, and the water may run in at the raft-port and &s;ink her. And in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els which are deep loaded, and lie a-ground upon mud, and e&s;pecially if their bottoms are flat, &s;uch as a great number of ve&s;&s;els are which carry goods up and down rivers, when deep loaden the ma&s;ters dread and avoid, as much as they can, laying them in the mud, on account of its &s;uction, as it's com|monly called, and thought to be, but is entirely owing to the airs pre&s;&s;ure downwards, acting upon the parts where the air and water are pre&s;&s;ed from under them, that their ve&s;&s;els are in dan|ger, of &s;inking before they can ri&s;e or float out of the mud, and which &s;ometimes pulls pieces of &s;heathing off &s;hips bottoms, from the &s;ame cau&s;e, when the water gets between the bottom and the &s;heathing, and none between that and the mud. The &s;ame cau&s;e will al&s;o keep wood, or any other thing that will &s;wim, and is lighter than water, from ri&s;ing; for if their buoyancy don't lift them before the water flows upon them, the weight and pre&s;&s;ure of the water is then added to the airs pre&s;&s;ure downwards to prevent their ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>IF a man, tho' famous for &s;wiming or diving,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How mud may occa|&s;ion peo|ple to be drowned.</NOTE> by accident &s;hould fall, or out of bravado jump into the water to dive, if his feet only reaches the mud, and &s;ink &s;o far as to pre&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="17">
the water from under them, the pre&s;&s;ure of the air and water downwards, will hold his feet &s;o fa&s;t, that all his &s;truggling won't be able to relieve him: The only help that can be given him, is &s;omething that he may gra&s;p or lay hold of with his hands before he loo&s;es his &s;ences, or a boat-hook, &amp;c. to hook him at all hazard, and to hawl him out of the mud.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The air's pre&s;&s;ure is the cau&s;e of what is common|ly called &s;uction.</NOTE>WHAT is commonly or vulgarly termed &s;uction, is cau&s;ed by the pre&s;&s;ure of the air, which forces and rai&s;es the water upwards, in our common &s;ucking-pumps, as they are called, where the work|ing of the boxes and clappers only pump up the air fir&s;t, and takes off its pre&s;&s;ure downwards from the in&s;ide or bore of the pump, when the air pre&s;&s;ing upon the water in the well, will make it ri&s;e to the height of thirty-three feet above its level, up a pump or pipe, where the power of the air is taken off; and quick-&s;ilver, that is about fourteen times the weight of water, will ri&s;e to about thirty-one inches in a tube or gla&s;s pipe, void of air:&mdash;And the&s;e prove a ba|lance, or equal weight to the pre&s;&s;ure of our air or atmo&s;phere; and which air when in its mo&s;t den&s;e or heavie&s;t &s;tate, will very &s;eldom rai&s;e the&s;e fluids higher.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">On the weather judg'd from the weight of the air.</NOTE>BUT the air in our Northern climates is con&s;tantly varying, and is &s;ometimes about a tenth part rarer or lighter than at other times, con&s;equently when lighte&s;t loo&s;es, about a tenth part of its power to buoy up any matter that is floating in it, or to rai&s;e water or quick-&s;ilver, which la&s;t then &s;tands at its lowe&s;t &s;tation in our barome|ters or weather-gla&s;&s;es, at about twenty-eight inches high, on the in|dex where the weather is marked; the con&s;equence of the airs be|ing in its rare&s;t or lighte&s;t &s;tate; is that either the watry particles floating in it will fall in &s;now or rain, or it is made light, by an over charge of elementary fire or &s;ulphureous particles floating in it, by which I have had my &s;ails &s;tuck full of black &s;pecks, from the dews falling then upon them, when &s;ailing upon the coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary.</HI> This inflamatory matter in the air, no doubt, is the cau&s;e of lightening and thunder; for I have &s;een the &s;ame &s;ort of black &s;pecks on the &s;ails of &s;hips, where they have been &s;truck and tore with lightening; and if rain, &s;now or thunder does not hap+pen, a &s;torm of wind (as mark'd on the index) is expected to be the con&s;equence, by the airs flying or ru&s;hing along with a &s;wift mo|tion from where it is den&s;e or heavier, and endeavouring to come to an equality in weight, with the place where it is rare or in its lighte&s;t &s;tate. As the air increa&s;es in its weight, it pre&s;&s;es the heavier on the quick-&s;ilver or mercury below, and rai&s;es it proportionably
<PB N="5" REF="18">
higher in the tube; and when it comes to twenty-nine inches and a half, the air is then reckoned at the medium or middle &s;tate, and there the weather is mark'd changeable; but when the mer|cury comes to be forced above thirty inches; from that to thirty-one inches, is mark'd fair, dry, fro&s;t, &s;erene weather, &amp;c. as &s;uch may be expected, when the air is den&s;e or in its heavy &s;tate; it then rai&s;es and buoys up the particles floating in it, to a greater height, where they may be &s;eparated &s;o as to make the &s;ky clear of clouds for a time. The&s;e are the conclu&s;ions which I imagine our Philo&s;ophers fixed on, when they endeavoured to make the barome|ter or air weigher, to foretel the different weather that might be expected.</P>
<P>BUT, (as a &s;ailor) I venture to &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the un|certainty of wea|ther gla&s;|&s;es.</NOTE> that the weather often proves very different from what is pointed out by our weather-gla&s;&s;es, or by any other of tho&s;e improv'd in&s;truments or rules that have been made by later, and more accurate ob&s;ervers of the air and weather that I have yet &s;een, and I doubt their being of any great &s;ervice to &s;ea-faring people; for I have &s;een &s;trong gails with a high gla&s;s, not only Ea&s;terly, (which commonly rai&s;es the mercury) but when up at thirty inches, I have known it blow &s;trong We&s;terly, with rain and &s;now; I have likewi&s;e &s;een moderate and fair weather, with the mercury as low as twenty-eight inches three tenths. I have been in the open ocean along way from any land, in moderate and fair weather, &s;ailing plea&s;antly along, when &s;uddenly the &s;hip has been &s;truck with a &s;ingle fla&s;h of lightning: This inflamable matter in the air, like electrical matter, &s;eemed to take fire at the touch of the &s;hip's ma&s;ts.</P>
<P>BUT in ju&s;tice to barometers, I mu&s;t own I had once,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;torm once pointed out by the weather gla&s;s.</NOTE> and but once, the advantage of a true admonition of an approaching &s;torm of wind, from <HI>Tampion</HI>'s portable barometer, which I carried to &s;ea with me as a weather-gla&s;s for &s;ome time; and this happened at the mouth of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> channel, when about &s;eventy ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed from the <HI>Downs,</HI> with a moderate breeze in the S. E. quarter. In the morning after leaving the <HI>Downs.</HI> I perceived a &s;udden fall of the quick-&s;ilver, from about twenty-nine inches and a half, to about twenty-eight inches and a half; we had then all our &s;mall &s;ails &s;et; on this alteration, I ordered all hands to work, and took in our &s;mall &s;ails, got down top-gallant yards, and did all that was thought mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, to prepare for an approaching &s;torm, which came on about eight in the evening, when we were a-brea&s;t of the <HI>Lizard;</HI> the wind from being moderate at S. S. E. came &s;uddenly
<PB N="6" REF="19">
to N. N. W. and blowed &s;o &s;trong, that tho' we had no &s;ails loo&s;e but the fore-&s;ail in the brails, yet it laid the &s;hip more down on her broad&s;ide than ever I knew her, by any &s;tre&s;s or pre&s;&s;ure of &s;ails. This &s;udden change of weather, and of the wind to the oppo&s;ite point of the compa&s;s, probably proved of bad con&s;equence to all who were unprepared for it. The next morning we &s;aw a <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> &s;hip, floating bottom up, which we &s;uppo&s;ed was loaded with timber, and had been over&s;et by this unexpected &s;torm, taking her a-back with all &s;ails &s;et, and the accounts we had afterwards, were, that mo&s;t of this fleet &s;uffered damage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">On the defects of a weather gla&s;s for &s;ea &s;er|vice.</NOTE>BUT I mu&s;t acknowledge a defect in this portable barometer, for &s;ea &s;ervice, which is, that the quick-&s;ilver always kept the &s;hips motion up and down, &s;o that its height, mu&s;t be taken from the me|dium of that motion; and I never had the opportunity of meeting with the marine barometer, &s;uch as was carried to &s;ea by the great Doctor <HI>Hally,</HI> and which I judge from its not being continued in practice, has not an&s;wered the commendable de&s;ign, of giving &s;ome certainty of the weather, to &s;hips at &s;ea: Yet it mu&s;t be allowed, that the di&s;covery of the&s;e properties in the air or atmo&s;phere, has proved of great advantage in the management of pumps and &s;yphons, or crooked pipes to rai&s;e water, and in many other u&s;eful inventions.</P>

<HEAD>On WIND.</HEAD>
<P>WIND may be &s;aid to be only the air moving over the &s;ur|face of our globe, from one place where it is heavier, to|wards another place where it is lighter, which difference occa&s;ions its different directions; and the &s;wiftne&s;s of its motion, is in propor|tion to the different den&s;ities of the air in different places, as PRO|VIDENCE has plea&s;ed to order it for many valuable purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>WE call it calm, when the air is without motion; but when the air moves, we call it wind; and its power is calculated to increa&s;e, in proportion to the &s;quare of its velocity or &s;wiftne&s;s with which it flies, which is at the rate of about &s;ixty miles an hour, in one of the greate&s;t &s;torms in our climate, as the ingenious <HI>Smeaton</HI> has &s;hewn in his table of winds, after he had found out what may be called the fix'd &s;tandard for wind-mill &s;ails, from ingenious experiments, which I
<PB N="7" REF="20">
have &s;een him make in a clo&s;e room; for the air though at re&s;t, or in a calm, will act upon any body that is put in motion, as &s;o much wind of the &s;ame &s;wiftne&s;s. Suppo&s;e a &s;hip launching in a calm to gain a velocity, or run at the rate of a mile in a mi|nute, at this time, the &s;hip will feel the &s;ame effect from this calm, as one of our greate&s;t &s;torms of a mile in a minute or &s;ixty miles an hour, would have had upon her &s;tern, when &s;he was fa&s;t upon the &s;tocks; and a &s;hip launched with the &s;ame velocity, and in the &s;ame direction with this &s;torm of wind, would feel it calm, for the time the run as fa&s;t as the wind blowed, as may be noticed, when it happens that &s;hips are launched with a bri&s;k wind, and their colours blowing aft, the &s;ame way they are to run, when they come to a quick motion in launching, their colours flie fored for that time. And when any body is put into &s;o quick a motion through the air, as not to give the air time to clo&s;e behind it, in that ca&s;e it makes in &s;ome degree, a vacuum, and in proportion to this vacuum, there will not only be the re&s;i&s;tance, but the pre&s;&s;ure of the air, acting upon the&s;e bodies, which may be near fifteen pounds upon every &s;quare inch; and this may be the rea&s;on why &s;hips ma&s;ts and yards, &s;ome times are rowl'd away in a calm, when they are put into &s;o very quick motion, by a labour&s;ome &s;hip's rowling. A &s;hip under way in a calm, where there is a &s;trong tide or current, will be affected as if a light air or gentle wind was right again&s;t and in proportion to the &s;trength of the tide or current.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pro|porties, of water.</NOTE>WATER is a fluid element, capable to float &s;hips, and Philo&s;ophers tell us, that the particles or &s;ingle parts of water are &s;o &s;mall, that their form can't be preceived by the be&s;t micro&s;copes, or greate&s;t magnifying gla&s;&s;es; but that they mu&s;t be round and &s;mooth, from their moving &s;o freely one among&s;t a|nother; and from their ea&s;ily giving way, and opening a pa&s;&s;age for all bodies moving therein: And particles of water mu&s;t be hard, and touch each other, as it is known from experience, that water can't be compre&s;&s;ed or forced into le&s;s compa&s;s than its natural bulk, by any power or weight that can be employed upon it, and as action and re-action are equal and contrary to each other, it re-acts as it is acted upon.</P>
<P>WATER will float the greate&s;t or heavie&s;t bodies that take up more room in water than it &s;elf, and &s;hips, boats, or ve&s;&s;els, with all they contain in or about them, and all other things that will float in water, are exactly the &s;ame weight as the bulk of water they di&s;place, by the bulk of that part of their bodies actually in the water, and be|low their &s;wiming mark, which is lower down or higher up, ac|cording to the weight or den&s;ity of the water they &s;wim in; for &s;hips are known to &s;wim lighter in &s;alt water than in fre&s;h, in proportion as the &s;alt is heavier than fre&s;h: Therefore, &s;uppo&s;e a pint of water to weigh a pound, (as it does or thereabouts in common) and any thing that will &s;wim in water and weigh a pound, put into a ve&s;&s;el full

<P>WHEN &s;hips are contracted for to be built, and their dimen&s;ions agreed upon, the owners commonly want what is called a long floor, which is generally reckoned to make &s;hips have all good properties; and this long floor is made by having &s;o many floor-timbers exactly of the &s;ame mold, laid all at equal height on a &s;traight keel, in the mainbody, or mo&s;t bearing part of the &s;hip, and are called very pro|perly, &s;o many dead flats; and then the other floor timbers begin to have more ri&s;e, till they come to &s;tand upon dead wood, towards the &s;tem and &s;tern-po&s;t, to form the entrance and run of the &s;hip.</P>

any great &s;tre&s;s, by weight or pre&s;&s;ure of fluids, has upon any body that is &s;traight or flat, and how little they will bear in proporti|on to bodies that are made curv'd or &s;ome ways circular, &s;o as to form &s;ome &s;ort of an arch, as may be ob&s;erved in tho&s;e almo&s;t flat arches, which tho' made of but &s;mall and loo&s;e materials, &s;uch as brick and mortar, will bear great &s;tre&s;s and weight upon them. And it's known from experiments by the air pump, how much le&s;s pre&s;&s;ure of air from without, will break a ve&s;&s;el that is flat &s;ided, than will break a ve&s;&s;el that is rounding or circular; which la&s;t will bear the whole pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere without being hurt. And the ex|periments mentioned in the ninth page, of the pre&s;&s;ure of water on different &s;haped bottles, &s;hew us that the fir&s;t &s;quare ca&s;e-bottle which broke at between &s;ix and &s;even fathom deep, had two of its &s;ides a little rounding outward, which two &s;ides came up whole; but the other two being more flat were bur&s;t in, notwith&s;tanding the extraordinary thickne&s;s of the gla&s;s, of the&s;e &s;quare bottles, compared with that of the <HI>Florence</HI> fla&s;ks, which are made like an egg &s;hell, and which bore fifteen fathom pre&s;&s;ure. The&s;e experiments, and what may be learned from ob&s;ervation, &s;hew the bad effects which the water often has by its great power of pre&s;&s;ing upwards again&s;t the long floor of a &s;hip, &s;o that it &s;oon makes the place of the&s;e dead flats hog and become a hollow upwards, whil&s;t the &s;hip in her upper-works &s;eems to keep her proper &s;heer; and that this is a fact, may be perceived by any one who takes the lea&s;t notice, when they &s;ee long floor'd &s;hips laid upon even ground, how the keel, and the floor'd part of the bottom bends upwards; or when put upon level blocks in a graving-dock how hard they bear upon the fore and after blocks, which blocks I have known &s;plit, and the keel damaged by the &s;tre&s;s being much more upon its fore and after parts than on that part under the flat of the floor, and that the &s;hip has been &s;o &s;trained, as to be obliged to be dock'd a &s;econd time; which mu&s;t naturally weaken her, and &s;he mu&s;t carry le&s;s weight in pro|portion as her floor is bulged upwards, which mu&s;t form one of the wor&s;t bottoms a &s;hip can &s;wim upon, by its being a hollow up|wards, where it &s;hould be rounding downwards, which in my o|pinion would contribute greatly to make &s;hips &s;tronger to bear the pre&s;&s;ure of the ground, as well as the water, and help their &s;ailing, &s;teering, &s;taying and wareing.</P>
<P>FOR the above rea&s;ons, and many others which might be given,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To build &s;hips with rounding bottoms.</NOTE> I am of opinion, that all &s;hips &s;hould be built with a root or rank end of a keel-piece fored, and which &s;hould be &s;traight all the way below; and
<PB N="12" REF="25">
the upper part work'd with a curve, from the &s;tem to the after-part of the floor, &s;o that the fore and main part of the &s;hip's bot|tom may be made to form a curve, or be rounding a little down|wards, &s;uppo&s;e with about the &s;ame &s;heer as &s;hips bends have in common, and the &s;tem &s;hould project with &s;uch a rake forward from the upper part of the keel, that all the horizontal water-lines in the &s;hips entrance, may form curves outwards all the way, which will be le&s;s re&s;i&s;ted in pa&s;&s;ing through the water, than tho&s;e unnatural hollows which are too commonly made there, and which I have known to occa&s;ion very de&s;tructive pitching motions in a fine &s;hip.</P>
<P>THE above method of building, in my opinion, would turn to the advantage of all concerned; for by the floor timbers lying &s;o much farther forward on this curv'd part of the keel it &s;elf, with|out chocks, or the dead wood fored that is commonly made u&s;e of; the &s;hip will be &s;tronger and more buoyant, to carry more, with le&s;s timber, iron, and workman&s;hip. I would recommend the deep end of the keel to project as far forward, before the &s;carf of the &s;tem, and the fore gripe added to it, to be as rank as can with &s;afety be fa&s;tened; this with the deepe&s;t part of the keel fored, will make up for what may be thought wanting in the uprightne&s;s of the &s;tem, and the rankne&s;s of the keel under the lowe&s;t flooring, to help the &s;hip &s;ailing by the wind. The &s;tern po&s;t &s;hould have no more rake aft, than ju&s;t to make the back of the rudder &s;tand up|right when the &s;hip is upon an even keel; and the run, or after-part of the bottom, to be according to the main and fore-part: If built full for burden at a &s;mall draft of water, the run in pro|portion to be fuller and &s;horter, to make her an&s;wer this purpo&s;e. But if the &s;hip is to be built &s;harp, for &s;ailing fa&s;t by the wind, as well as with the wind large; then &s;he will require a long run, drawn fair, without any extraordinary full part in the water, to hin|der it from ri&s;ing, and clo&s;ing to its level again, regularly and readily in proportion, as the body of the &s;hip may be forced through the water, without making a great eddy, or carrying much dead water after her. But &s;harpne&s;s may be carried to an extreme, for &s;hips require a &s;preading body at the water's edge, both afore and abaft, to &s;upport them from being plung'd too deep into the &s;ea, and gives the water more after-body to act upon as it ri&s;es and clo&s;es abaft, to help the &s;hip forward in her progre&s;&s;ive motion, when &s;ailing fa&s;t.</P>

<P>I have &s;ailed in a &s;hip built full for carrying, in the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> trade, which was took by a <HI>French</HI> &s;quadron, in little wind; but when the wind blew &s;trong, &s;he could be the headmo&s;t and weather-mo&s;t &s;hip in the fleet. The la&s;t war but one I commanded a &s;hip remarkably &s;harp and &s;light; &s;he was built at <HI>Malta</HI> for a crui&s;ing &s;hip, from the timbers of their old Galleys; &s;he mea&s;ured above 330 tons, was 88 feet keel, and 27 feet beam, &s;he was built low, with a &s;hallow &s;helving bottom every way. In cha&s;ing with this &s;hip, when little wind and a head &s;ea, we have &s;teered right up to the cha&s;e, when all their endeavours could not keep their &s;hips head to the &s;ea, but lay broad&s;ide to the waves. A &s;mall pre&s;&s;ure of wind and &s;ail, would put this &s;hell of a &s;hip to her utmo&s;t &s;peed, and when the wind blew with a velocity of about thirty miles an hour, I reckoned (in &s;ailing large) we could make her go at the rate of about eleven miles an hour; therefore we never de&s;ired more wind but rather le&s;s than that, to give us all the advantages we wanted in crui&s;ing again&s;t our enemies, &s;o as to be able to take or leave as we plea&s;ed. In tacking this &s;hip, when it blowed &s;o fre&s;h that we could ju&s;t carry whole top&s;ails, we found our advantage in hawl|ing up the main&s;ail and fore&s;ail, to make her &s;ure in &s;taying, other|wi&s;e &s;he would get &s;ternway &s;o quickly, as to prevent her coming about: this bad property I attributed to the lightne&s;s of the &s;hip's body, which could not bear &s;o much &s;ail aback, without lo&s;ing her headway; and the long time &s;he took to bring the wind a-head, was probably occa&s;ioned by her length being out of proportion to her breadth, for a ready and clo&s;e turning &s;hip. This &s;hip had another great defect, viz. want of her bow's being fuller, at, and above the water's edge, which would make little or no re&s;i&s;tance in the water, to hinder &s;hips &s;ailing in fine weather, but is a great help to their &s;ailing, by keeping them from plunging &s;o much into the &s;ea, in bad weather, which was the ca&s;e with this &s;hip when pre&s;&s;ed hard with &s;ail upon a wind, for in a great &s;ea, her bow's being like a wedge, &s;he plunged her&s;elf under, forward, which not only hindered her &s;ailing &s;o fa&s;t as &s;he would have done, but occa|&s;ioned her &s;training, to &s;uch a degree at tho&s;e times, that we were obliged to add b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iling to pumping, to keep the water from gaining upon us.&mdash;This is mentioned to &s;hew, that &s;hape and proporti|on

The &s;wifte&s;t fi&s;h &s;een in motion at &s;ea, as well as tho&s;e fowl which &s;wim and dive in water, are all formed with their bodies rounding, as is above recommended.</P>
<P>I HAD the advantages of the above recommendation farther confirmed by an accidental experiment, made by a commander of a long and flat floor'd collier cat, who is a man of veracity; he re|lated
<PB N="15" REF="28">
to me, that loading his &s;hip at Liverpool with rock &s;alt, in order to prevent the &s;hip from being too &s;tiff and labour&s;ome, he had it &s;towed in as &s;hort a compa&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, in the middle or main body of the &s;hip, and left two great empty &s;paces, one afore and another abaft, which occa&s;ioned the flat floor under the &s;alt to bend downwards, and &s;o as to make the &s;hip very leaky, this, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed opened the butts in that part; the &s;hip by accident came aground, when he could &s;en&s;ibly feel her touch fir&s;t under where the &s;alt lay, which was contrary to what he ever felt by her before, and he &s;olemnly declared that he never knew the &s;hip to &s;ail, &s;teer, &s;tay, or ware &s;o well before or &s;ince.</P>
<P>THERE is another &s;trong circum&s;tance, which I think is a certain &s;ign that the rounding &s;haped bottom, and projecting &s;tem, is want|ed for &s;hips in general. The be&s;t trim as they are built now is found to be by the &s;tern, this cants the &s;traight part of their long floors upwards, which mu&s;t make a longer re&s;i&s;tance farther aft, but then it acts in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as the rounding bottomed &s;hip would do (but to more advantage) upon an even keel, and the more upright a &s;hip's &s;tem is, the more &s;he will require to be trim'd by the &s;tern to make her &s;tay, as well as ware readily; for the center of the&s;e turning motions will be where the center of gravity is, that is about the main frame; &s;o that the more upright the &s;tem is, the more it will hinder the &s;hip turning either way &s;o readily, and experience is the be&s;t guide in the&s;e matters. I have enquired after the properties of a &s;hip that was built with &s;tem and &s;ternpo&s;t both upright; the report I had from the commander was, that her per|formance came far &s;hort in &s;ailing, to what was expected, from her bottom, and that before they rai&s;ed her abaft, &s;o that &s;he &s;towed more goods there, which brought her to &s;ail two and a half feet by the &s;tern, &s;he oft refu&s;ed either &s;taying or wareing &s;o readily, as o|ther &s;hips in company would, and now that they are obliged to &s;ail &s;o much by the &s;tern, they are much plagued to get the anchors up from under the keel or fore foot, which may be of bad con&s;equence where there is little room to get under way, &s;o that the projecting &s;tem gives great ea&s;e in getting the anchors up readily, as well as helps a &s;hip greatly to ri&s;e and fall ea&s;y, and prevents her from being pre&s;&s;ed or plunged deep into the &s;ea; for the&s;e and many o|ther good rea&s;ons the &s;tem &s;hould keep projecting as high as the upper deck.</P>

<P>WHERE &s;hips are liable or are de&s;igned to take the ground, as in dry tide harbours, the rounding bottoms will certainly an&s;wer that purpo&s;e be&s;t, as they may be built either full for carrying, or &s;harp for &s;ailing, as occa&s;ion may require; with little or no depth of keel under the main body, &s;o as not to make them lie a long, but as they may &s;it quite upright, upon level ground; which will make the principal weight and &s;tre&s;s tend towards the middle of the lowe&s;t flooring, under the main or mid&s;hip frame; where the center of gravity of the whole will be accumulated and &s;upported, as upon the crown of an inverted arch, which form mu&s;t be allow|ed to be capable of bearing the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ure, with the lea&s;t da|mage; and to lay the greate&s;t &s;train where it ought to be, upon the middle or &s;tronge&s;t part of the floor timbers.</P>

I &s;ay, that making the kel|&s;on larger, and its bent downward, along with the ceiling and out|&s;ide plank in this part, will greatly make up above what may be thought a deficiency in &s;trength. 2d. To make the &s;hip hold an e|qual wind, it has been ob&s;erved, that what keel may be wanting under the mid&s;hip frame, is made up by what is added forward, under the &s;carf of the &s;tem; and &s;uppo&s;e a &s;hip's keel in common to be a foot deep, all the way fore and aft, and &s;uppo&s;e the round|ing bottom'd &s;hip to have but &s;ix inches keel, under her mid&s;hip frame, and to have eighteen inches under the &s;carf of the &s;tem, this will make up that deficiency forward; and abaft the run becomes

&s;o &s;harp and thin, that the plank lies almo&s;t upright with the plain &s;urface of the keel and &s;ternpo&s;t.

<HEAD>On Hanging SHIPS RUDDERS.</HEAD>
<P>SHIPS are &s;ometimes lo&s;t, by having their rudders beaten off in &s;triking upon the ground, which may be prevented by a me|thod of hanging rudders, practi&s;ed at Parkgate, and which I think de&s;erves particular notice, and e&s;pecially, where the navigation is among &s;hoals, or where &s;hips are liable to &s;trike upon the ground; this method permits the rudder to ri&s;e about 20 inches, by having bands upon the rudder, the &s;ame as are in common upon the &s;tern|po&s;t, with a long iron &s;pindle, to go through the eyes of all the&s;e bands, and which permits the rudder to ri&s;e and fall, as the &s;hip happens to &s;trike; and from the good report of foreign &s;hips, as well as coa&s;ters, that have tried this method, I think it ought to become more general, where the rudder head comes upon deck, or where it can be contrived to let the rudder and tiller ri&s;e high enough for this purpo&s;e, which will &s;ave the &s;tre&s;s from the &s;ternpo&s;t, as well as the rudder from breaking and un&s;hipping, which is often the ca&s;e from the pre&s;ent practice, by having tho&s;e &s;hort irons upon the rudder, that are chock'd and &s;topt, to prevent the rudder un&s;hipping.</P>

<P>I PROFESS my&s;elf an advocate for tall ma&s;ts, and &s;hort yards, from the example of &s;hips in the coal and timber trades to the city of London, and from the experience I have had in &s;hips &s;ailing fa&s;ter upon a wind, from &s;hortning their yards, which mu&s;t ea&s;e them by making every thing lighter, in proportion as the yards are &s;horter; even the expence is le&s;s at fir&s;t fitting out, and to the &s;hip and every thing aloft in wear and tear afterwards, and in &s;ailing her with fewer hands.</P>
<P>ALL ma&s;ts which are to be made from crooked poles, &s;hould be made and fitted to &s;tand with the back aft, that is with the project|ing or crooked ends forward, which will make them &s;tand upright without that great &s;tre&s;s upon the &s;tays, that has to act again&s;t all the other rigging, to prevent the ma&s;ts heads from raking too much aft, which is mo&s;t commonly the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THE method we now practice of having few blocks, and little to phamper aloft, for ea&s;e and neatne&s;s, is certainly right, and &s;hould be pur&s;ued as far as it can with &s;afety, but I would advi&s;e not to carry this fa&s;hion to an extreme, by having too many &s;heave holes cut in the ma&s;t heads, for I have known many top ma&s;ts break in the place of the &s;heeve holes, under the rigging.</P>

The good effects of deep and narrow &s;quare&s;ails, can't be better recommended to an|&s;wer this purpo&s;e, than by the performance of &s;hips in the coal and timber trades to London, tho' the de&s;ign'd properties in building and fitting the&s;e &s;hips, are burden at a &s;mall draft of water, to take and bear the ground well, and to &s;ail with few hands, and little balla&s;t, yet the&s;e &s;hips perform &s;o well at &s;ea, that the go|verment often makes choice of them for &s;tore &s;hips, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant naval expeditions; and in narrow channels among &s;hoals, and turning to windward in narrow rivers, there are no &s;hips of equal burthen can match them, for which I attribute a great deal, to their deep narrow &s;quare&s;ails, which may be perceived to trim &s;o flat and fair, upon a wind, that all the canva&s;s &s;tands full, at a proper angle from the directions of the keel, &s;o that the wind goes freely off from the lee leach of the&s;e &s;ails, without being much altered in its direction from one &s;ail to the back of the next, which is not the ca&s;e, when a &s;hip's &s;quare&s;ails are &s;o broad as to overlap each other much, one &s;ail then &s;hakes the next to it, and they ex|tend &s;o far to leeward, that the lee &s;heets make the afterpart of the canva&s;s, or lee leaches, &s;tand rather, as &s;o much back &s;ail to &s;top the &s;hips way, or only to pre&s;s the &s;hip's &s;ide down and to leeward, which is the effect of all the canva&s;s in a &s;hips &s;ails, when it does not &s;tand at a proper angle with the direction of the keel, when a &s;hip is &s;ailing clo&s;e by the wind.

<P>I HAVE tried the &s;trength of a number of threads together, made fa&s;t to a &s;cale beam, fir&s;t, laid in a &s;traight direction, without any twi&s;t, like to a &s;olvigee; &s;econd, the &s;ame number moderately twi&s;t|ed; third, an equal quantity twi&s;ted more, and found from repeated experiments, that tho&s;e with the moderate twi&s;t, bore the greate&s;t weight before they broke, and that a number of threads joined to|gether will not bear a proportional weight to one of them &s;ingly, that is, ten threads comes a great way &s;hort of bearing ten times the weight that one thread bore &s;ingly, and I reckon the ca&s;e is the &s;ame with a rope and one of its yarns.</P>

<P>A Ship &s;ailing, &s;teering, &s;taying and waring, and being lively and comparitively ea&s;y at &s;ea in a &s;torm, in my opinion, de|pends greatly on the cargo, balla&s;t, or other materials, being pro|perly

<P>BUT this &s;ubject requires and de&s;erves encouragement for the la|bour of &s;ome of our greate&s;t mathematicians, to account from fix'd principles, and give rea&s;ons, why &s;hips, or the &s;ame &s;hip, may be thus differently effected by &s;towage, &s;o as to in&s;truct &s;eamen in this mo&s;t important point of duty, becau&s;e, &s;ucce&s;s, as well as &s;afety, may great|ly depend upon it; for it is known that our government has had two &s;hips of war built by the &s;ame mold, fitted out in the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame materials, as near as po&s;&s;ible, yet one &s;hip an&s;wered much better than the other, this can only proceed from different management, which induces me, &s;ailor-like, not to halt before I find my&s;elf quite lam'd, but to pu&s;h forward, at all hazard, to en|deavour to explain what I know, from experience and ob&s;ervation, which I hope will be found of &s;ome &s;ervice, if it but induces others more capable, to con&s;ider and treat on this mo&s;t important &s;ubject, with that attention and to that extent it de&s;erves.</P>

<P>THE bad con&s;equence of a &s;hip being too &s;tiff, I experienced in one of the Governments old twenty gun &s;hips, which was bought and fitted out with lighter guns and materials than &s;he formerly car|ried, and was loaded with a general cargo of different goods for the We&s;t-Indies, &s;he was but about fourteen days at &s;ea, when down came our main yard, occa&s;ioned by the new main tye, being chafed to pieces in the middle of the rope, or in&s;ide of the &s;trands, by one &s;trand rubbing again&s;t the other, from the &s;hips extraordinary quick rolling motion, and which &s;oon wore out the other rigging, and al&s;o work'd loo&s;e the hull in proportion. With quite a full &s;hip from Jamaica, we have rolled away a new &s;et of main lanyards in one night, though we u&s;ed in the &s;towing her, all po&s;&s;ible means that the goods of the different cargoes we carried would admit of, &s;o as to lay the heavie&s;t part as high in the middle of the &s;hip as we could, to overcome this bad property; notwith&s;tanding which when in company with other &s;hips, in fine weather, &s;ailing before the wind

with a long following &s;well of a &s;ea, they all carried their topgal|lant&s;ails and &s;tudding &s;ails, without any inconveniency or dan|ger, when we were obliged to take in our &s;tudding&s;ails, topgallant|&s;ails, &amp;c. and lower the top&s;ails half ma&s;t, to &s;ave the topma&s;ts from being rolled away. We loaded a cargo of lead and leather, &amp;c. for Leghorn, and &s;towed the lead upon a great height of leather, which we &s;crewed down with boards upon it, to &s;upport the lead at a proper height, to keep the &s;hip tolerable ea&s;y in the &s;ea, which an&s;wered our de&s;ign, the fir&s;t part of the pa&s;&s;age very well, but the &s;hip working by the motion of the &s;ea, occa&s;ioned the lead by its weight to pre&s;s the leather a great deal lower, in the latter part of the pa&s;&s;age, by which &s;he became &s;o labour&s;ome as to roll away two topma&s;ts in &s;pite of our be&s;t endeavours. This experience convinced me, that this &s;hip was too broad, and her decks &s;ay too low in pro|portion for a merchant &s;hip, for carrying general cargoes to the be&s;t advantage, but &s;he was more fit for what &s;he was fir&s;t de&s;igned, viz. to carry heavy guns and heavy materials above water, which could counterpoi&s;e and make her more ea&s;y in great &s;eas.</P>

<HEAD>On the Center of GRAVITY, MOTION and CAVITY of a SHIP.</HEAD>
<P>THESE are fundamental points which are certainly in a &s;hip; and her trim, as la&s;t mentioned, depends upon their places, but &s;o little are they under&s;tood, as I have been told, that a great &s;ea officer was heard to &s;ay, when his &s;hip was labouring hard in a rough &s;ea, how &s;hould &s;he but roll when &s;he had &s;o much top-hamper? which was a&s;cribing the effect to a wrong cau&s;e, and what will be often the ca&s;e till the fundamental principles are known; I am therefore emboldened to endeavour to communicate what I have learned of the&s;e difficult points, hoping an abler pen, will &s;ome time undertake to mend and make up my defects, in the knowledge of the&s;e points, that they may become u&s;eful to &s;eaman|&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE center of cavity of a &s;hip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">On the center of cavity</NOTE> is a point in the middle of the hold, or hollow buoyant part of the hull, which &s;upports her load|ing and her materials, but it is in reality the cavity, or the center of the bearing part of the &s;hips body, that is immer&s;ed in the wa|ter, that acts to &s;upport her in all the different &s;ituations, and moti|ons a &s;hip is &s;ubject to, which occa&s;ions this center of the cavity immer&s;ed, to be always &s;hifting its place, as the different parts of the &s;hips hull happen to be in the water, it moves from being about the mid&s;hip, when the &s;hip &s;wims upright and upon an even keel, to forward or aft, as the &s;hip is trim'd more by the head or &s;tern, and from one &s;ide to the other, in proportion as the &s;hip is made to heel.</P>
<P>THE center of gravity of a &s;hip, is a point &s;ome where in her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And cen|ter of gra+vity.</NOTE> where the weight of the whole &s;hip, cargo and materials in and a|bout her is brought to a point; when the &s;hip &s;wims upright and upon an even keel, it is &s;ome where in a line of direction from the &s;tem to the &s;ternpo&s;t, and where another line would cro&s;s it about the mid&s;hip frame, from one &s;ide to the other, where, if the &s;hip could be &s;u&s;pended in air, &s;he would lye in any po&s;ition &s;he was put into.</P>
<P>BUT the center of gravity of a &s;hip, is always liable to alter its place, higher or lower, more forward or aft, on one &s;ide or the other, according to the &s;tre&s;s or weight that happens to be laid, upon the different parts of the &s;hip or her materials, not only by the management of the &s;towage, but by the power and pre&s;&s;ure of the waves and wind.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="43"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why a &s;hip over|&s;ets and what &s;up|ports her from over &s;etting.</NOTE>THE center of gravity of a &s;hip, as in other heavy bodies, has always a tendency to de&s;cend towards the center of our globe, whether the &s;hip is on &s;hore or afloat, if it is not prevented from falling by a ba&s;e or bottom, that &s;preads without this point to &s;upport it. For whenever it happens that a &s;hip is laid on &s;hore, and heels &s;o much that the center of gravity overhangs that part of the &s;hips bilge, upon the ground, that ought to &s;upport it, the &s;hip will be &s;ure to tumble over, if not prevented by &s;ome means. And when a &s;hip is afloat, if ever &s;he heels &s;o much, that the cen|ter of gravity goes farther over to one &s;ide than the center of cavity, or the middle of the bearing part of the &s;hips body, then immer&s;ed in the water, the &s;hip will over&s;et; but whil&s;t the center of cavity immer&s;ed, goes fa&s;ter and farther over to the &s;hips &s;ide in her mo|tions, &s;o as to keep without the perpendicular of the center of gra|vity, the &s;hip will be &s;upported from over&s;etting, and the water will act upon the center of cavity immer&s;ed, in proportion to its di&s;|tance without the center of gravity, with more or le&s;s power, to bring the &s;hip upright again, as &s;oon as the force of the wind or waves cea&s;es, or the power or weight is taken off or &s;hifted, that occa&s;ioned the &s;hip to heel or turn on one &s;ide.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">On the center of motion.</NOTE>THE center of motion of a &s;hip, depends upon the places of the center of cavity and gravity, as la&s;t mentioned, and as they alter, the center of motion &s;hifts its place, but in &s;hips, as in other heavy bodies in motion, this point always endeavours to be, at the &s;ame place with the center of gravity, and it is really &s;o, when the cen|ter of gravity is above the &s;urface of the water, and the &s;hip is afloat; but when the center of gravity is below the &s;urface of the water, and the water &s;mooth, then the center of motion is at the water's edge, which I found by experiments that I made with models of &s;hips, about three feet long, in a trough of water.</P>

found it about an inch and a half above the pins, at the water's edge, and found the points of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion on each &s;ide, about the &s;ame height above water a mid&s;hips; I &s;tuck pins in the&s;e four points, pointing to the center of gravity in the hold, I found by re|peated trials, that the&s;e upper pins or points, were the axis or the center of motion that &s;he turn'd upon; when making her heel and roll, tho&s;e upper pins in the &s;tem and &s;ternpo&s;t had little or no motion, whil&s;t tho&s;e pins at the water's edge, ro&s;e out of the water as &s;he moved from &s;ide to &s;ide; and when &s;he was made to pitch and &s;oond, by pre&s;&s;ing her down fore and aft, tho&s;e pins on each &s;ide amid&s;hips, &s;eemed to have little or no motion, whil&s;t I confin'd them as &s;teady as po&s;&s;ible to a point.</P>

This &s;hip's &s;harp bot|tom in the water, when &s;he was upright, made too &s;mall a ba&s;e, and the center of cavity lay too low, to &s;upport her upright, with the center of gravity lying &s;o high above water, that it made her &s;ally or lie down on one &s;ide, till that brought a broader ba&s;e into the water, and the center of cavity (then immer&s;ed) higher up, and farther over, and without the center of gravity, &s;o that the center of cavity then became as a prop, to &s;upport the &s;hip from going lower, as &s;he &s;allied each way, and in this ca&s;e, the center of cavity was the center of motion, that &s;he turned upon, when her &s;ide was laid down; for all the weight and power that was without the cen|ter of cavity acted as a lever, the &s;ame as when &s;hips are hove down keel out, that lifted the center of gravity a little, as &s;he &s;allied, which &s;oon preponderated again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cen|ter of gra|vity and motion are at the &s;ame place in great &s;eas, and a &s;hips be|haviour depends upon that place.</NOTE> and the people always moving over to the upper &s;ide, accounts for this &s;hip's &s;allying.</P>
<P>THIS &s;hip's behaviour, and the above experiments, in my opinion, make it evident, that the center of motion of a &s;hip, is at the center of gravity, and according to the built of the &s;hip, and her center of gravity, being higher up or lower down, the different properties or behaviour of &s;hips, may be accounted for; from the con&s;truction of the above &s;hip, when loaded with refined &s;alt, that ju&s;t fil'd her, the center of gravity being then a great height, the report of her performance at &s;ea was that &s;he an&s;wered very well, and

was remarkably ea&s;y in her rolling motion, in great &s;eas, tho' the &s;pectators at her launching, expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, that they would be loath to go in her to &s;ea, on account of her rolling.</P>

I have &s;een a bomb &s;hell turn round in the air, by the center of gravity being near the middle: and where the center of gravity lies near one end, that heavie&s;t end will go fore|mo&s;t in all directions, upwards as well as downwards, as may be &s;een in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kyrockets, and arrows &s;hot from bows; an arrow &s;hot with the light end upwards, immediately turns upon its center of gravity for its center of motion.

<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed that there is a point in a &s;hip which may be called the center of motion, and which &s;he turns upon, con&s;equent|ly it has le&s;s motion than any other part of the &s;hip, when rolling, pitching, &s;cending, or in any other motion, a &s;hip is &s;ubject to, in great &s;eas, when its place is then at the center of gravity, which lying higher, or lower, according to the built of the &s;hip, contributes to make her comparitively ea&s;y, or unea&s;y, in high waves.</P>

<P>FOR a further confirmation of the above opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pro|perties of a collier cat load|en with timber.</NOTE> I examined into the properties of a collier cat, of about five hundred tons burden, that carried her loading of Riga timber, without any balla&s;t in the hold, and had about a ninth part of her cargo upon deck and on the quarters, and was &s;ufficiently &s;tiff, and remarkably ea&s;y in her

And this difference may be accounted for, from the above principles, for when this &s;hip was loaded with Riga timber, which is lighter than its bulk of wa|ter, it was computed, that about a third part of her cargo lay above the water's edge, at her loaded mark, which would bring the center of gravity and motion as high as the &s;urface of the water, when &s;he drew about &s;ixteen feet amid&s;hips; from thence to the upper part of the rigging at the maintopgallantma&s;t head, mea&s;ured one hundred and eight feet, which is &s;omewhat le&s;s than &s;even eight parts of the whole, above water; and above the center of motion; and is more than an eighth part under water, and below the center of motion, and what made her &s;ufficiently &s;tiff, was, her extraordinary breadth, and the tight free board, or upper works, above the loaded mark, that &s;upported the center of gravity &s;o high, and that occa&s;ioned her to be &s;o remarkable ea&s;y in her rolling, as the water and waves acted at the lea&s;t di&s;tance, and with the lea&s;t power po&s;&s;ible, above the center of motion, on that &s;mall part of her hull above her load mark, to move, and give any degree of violent rolling motion, to &s;o large a part of her body, that was under water, and below the cen|ter of gravity and motion; for what her keel was made to move &s;ide ways, her topgallantma&s;t head had a little le&s;s than &s;even times more to move in the &s;ame time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe|rence of being loaded with tim|ber and coal.</NOTE> therefore her rolling motion mu&s;t be much le&s;s, and ea&s;ier in great &s;eas, than it would be, if &s;he was loaded with coal, which is heavier than its bulk of water, and would make the center of gravity and motion lie &s;o much lower down in the hold, &s;uppo&s;e four feet below her load mark when &s;he drew &s;ixteen feet water; in this ca&s;e, the water is perpetually acting with an additional pow|er, on that four feet of the cavity of the &s;hips hull, that is immer&s;ed above the center of gravity, to &s;upport the &s;hip, and make her &s;o much &s;tiffer, to carry more &s;ail upon a wind with an upright &s;ide, in &s;mooth water, as before mentioned; and the &s;ame cau&s;e will make her more labour&s;ome in great &s;eas, when &s;he comes to be lifted up, with a &s;wift motion, from the bottom to the top of a high &s;teep moun|tainous wave, that may break in upon deck at the &s;ame time, as repre&s;ented, plate the 6th on &s;hips lying too.

a greater tendency to turn her bottom more up, as the center of gravity lies lower, as mentioned page the 33d, and in proportion, as the&s;e combin'd cau&s;es have turn'd the &s;hips weather &s;ide up, at the top of the wave, which then leaves the weather &s;ide, with more of the bottom lower down, without water to &s;upport it, which mu&s;t na|turally fall on the de&s;cending &s;ide of the wave, which now acts on the lee &s;ide of the &s;hip, to turn and plunge the weather &s;ide into the hollow of the next wave, which will act as before, to give the &s;hip more violent rolling motions, according to her breadth, and the height the waves have to act upon the &s;hip's hull, above the center of gravity, and motion, which now lies a little le&s;s than a tenth part, from the keel to the top gallantma&s;t head, &s;o that for every foot her keel is made to move by the above powers, &s;ide ways, the ma&s;t head has nine feet to move, in the &s;ame time, in&s;tead of &s;even, with a &s;lower motion, which was the ca&s;e when &s;he was loaded with timber, which I hope will be under&s;tood to account for the difference, why &s;he is more labour&s;ome when loaded with coals than with timber.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The con|&s;equence of load|ing lead without dunnage.</NOTE> And to &s;uppo&s;e this &s;hip was to be loaden to the &s;ame draft of water, without any dunnage in the bottom with lead, which is eleven times heavier than its bulk of water, which might bring the center of gravity and motion eight feet below the waters edge, and within eight feet of the lower part of the keel, which is little le&s;s than a fifteenth part from the keel to the topgallantma&s;thead, in &s;uch a trim its well known from experience, that in a &s;torm, the above mentioned cau&s;es would act with &s;o much more power, to give her more quick violent rol|ling motion, and for every foot her keel was made to move &s;ide|ways, the ma&s;t head would have to move fourteen feet in the &s;ame time, which would be &s;ure to make her roll away her ma&s;ts, in the fir&s;t place, and after that, become &s;o much more labour&s;ome, for want of them, &s;o as to be in great danger of foundering, by working loo&s;e the hull.</P>

<P>IT may not be ami&s;s here, to endeavour to explain by what means, and upon what principles it is, that this mo&s;t noble and u&s;eful machine a &s;hip, is made to gain ground, and is brought a|bout from one tack to the other, again&s;t the wind and waves, when they are moderate.</P>
<P>IT is well known that we have &s;hips that will &s;ail from &s;ix to nine miles an hour, upon a wind, when it blows fre&s;h and the water is &s;mooth, and will make their way good within &s;ix points of the wind, &s;o as to gain to windward, in &s;till water, a third of what they run by the logg; &s;uppo&s;e &s;ix miles an hour to gain two miles, or nine miles to gain three to windward, with the &s;ails trim'd in that ob|lique or &s;lanting direction as is particularly de&s;cribed page the 20th, which certainly tends to force the &s;hip much more broad&s;ide to lee|ward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What makes a Ship gain to wind|ward.</NOTE> than a-head; for it is a known principle, that a &s;hip &s;ailing with the wind upon the beam, and the plane of the &s;ails trim'd to four points or forty-five degrees from the direction of the keel, the &s;ails at that angle tend equally to drive the &s;hip broad-&s;ide to lee|ward as a-head; &s;o that a &s;hip &s;ailing and turning to windward as above mentioned, mu&s;t be owing to the &s;hape of the &s;hip's hull, which makes little re&s;i&s;tance in &s;ailing a-head, compared with the great re&s;i&s;tance made by the broad&s;ide in the water, not only by the &s;hip's extraordinary length in proportion to her breadth as has been ob&s;erved, but all tho&s;e thin parts, the dead wood, cut water, gripe, &s;tem, keel, &s;ternpo&s;t, and rudder, which make very little re&s;i&s;tance in the &s;hip's going a-head, but a powerful re&s;i&s;tance &s;ide|ways; that though the &s;ails are trim'd in that &s;harp direction, yet in a moderate wind when the &s;hip can carry all her &s;ails, by the wind and the water &s;mooth, &s;he will &s;ail with the wind two points before the beam, as fa&s;t, or fa&s;ter than &s;he will do when right before the wind, with the &s;ame breeze. Thus &s;uppo&s;e the wind blows at the rate of ten miles an hour, when one of the&s;e fa&s;t &s;ailing &s;hips may &s;ail at the rate of &s;ix miles, and gain two to windward, which in|crea&s;es

<HEAD>On a Ship driving to Windward with the Tide.</HEAD>
<P>IT often happens that there is not room to turn a ve&s;&s;el to wind|ward through a crowd of &s;hips, or in narrow channels, but &s;he mu&s;t drive by the help of the windward tide.</P>
<P>A SHIP in this &s;ituation, mu&s;t be managed according to the man|ner you de&s;ign to proceed, for if the tide is &s;trong enough, in pro|portion to the wind, &s;o that &s;he will drive fa&s;t enough to windward, &s;tern foremo&s;t, it will certainly be the be&s;t, as it may be done with or without any &s;ails &s;et, the yards being braced &s;harp up, as repre&s;ented plate the 3d. figure 1. A &s;hip may be &s;teered at plea&s;ure, and to a great nicety, end on to the tide, and &s;he will drive &s;tern foremo&s;t in le&s;s room than her own length; but it will require above three times her length to drive broad&s;ide, if the wind is right again&s;t the tide; and dexterous management is required on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, becau&s;e a &s;hip will always &s;hoot and tend towards that &s;hore a-head of her, &s;o that you cannot drive far upon one tack, though with the &s;ails a-back, without waring at times, to drive on the other tack, or the &s;hip will &s;oon &s;hoot on that &s;hore a-head of her, which I have &s;een in&s;tances of in &s;pite of all endea|vours to back a-&s;tern.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="68">REASONS, why &s;hips &s;hoot a-head, more than they can be backed a-&s;tern, when driving broad&s;ide with the tide, though the &s;ails are a-back.</P>
<P>SHIPS in general have a longer and &s;harper run-aft than they have an entrance forward, the &s;ternpo&s;t and rudder &s;tand more upright, than the &s;tem and gripe, and they &s;wim more or le&s;s by the &s;tern; therefore the after part of a &s;hip mu&s;t be more powerfully acted upon by the windward tide, than her fore part in the water, which con&s;equently &s;ets her &s;tern more to windward than her head, which at the &s;ame time is more acted upon by the wind above water than her &s;tern, in proportion as the forema&s;t, and all belonging to it, is larger and &s;tands further forward than the mizen ma&s;t &s;tands aft, and the bow&s;prit, with the jibboom, and all that belong to them projecting &s;o far over the bows, and nothing projecting over the &s;tern to hold wind, in the &s;ame proportion abaft; they mu&s;t natural|ly cau&s;e the &s;hip to drive with the wind mo&s;tly a-baft the beam.</P>
<P>AND though the mo&s;t effectual means are &s;uppo&s;ed to be u&s;ed on &s;uch occa&s;ions, to keep the &s;hip's bow to the wind, and prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible her falling off and &s;hooting a-head, by letting her drive with the after &s;ails braced flat a-back, the mizen hauled out, the helm a-lee, and the head &s;ails kept &s;hivering, as is repre&s;ented by figure 2, plate the 3d. where it appears as if a &s;hip might be backed a-&s;tern at plea&s;ure, yet experience proves the contrary, and the following rea&s;ons may be added to tho&s;e above mentioned: The helm mu&s;t be kept a-lee when driving in this way, and though the after &s;ails are a-back, the &s;hip will &s;hoot a-head, and back a-&s;tern alternately, but &s;he will come to with a &s;low motion by her head|way, till &s;he brings the wind before the beam, which gives her &s;tern|way and makes her fall round off upon her heel, with a quick mo|tion, and brings the wind &s;o far abaft the beam, that &s;he &s;oon gets headway again, &s;o that &s;he will &s;hoot much farther a-head than &s;he backs a-&s;tern, which makes it difficult to drive broad&s;ide with the tide, right again&s;t the wind, in little room, with &s;afety.</P>
<P>BUT I have heard of this difficulty being overcome, by two ve&s;&s;els driving broad&s;ide with their &s;terns confined near together by a rope, that each ve&s;&s;el could check and command the other, at plea&s;ure, to keep in a fair way, which I think is practable to the advantage of both ve&s;&s;els, as they may drive without any &s;ails, only hoi&s;ting a &s;tay&s;ail occa&s;ionally.</P>

<HEAD>To drive a Ship Broadfide to Windward, with the Tide right again&s;t the Wind.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a ma&s;terly and nece&s;&s;ary piece of &s;eaman&s;hip, to be able to perform this with &s;afety, where there is very little room, as is repre&s;ented plate the 3d. where the &s;hip figure 1. by the help of a &s;trong tide, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have drove &s;tern foremo&s;t, right to windward, where it was too narrow to drive broad&s;ide, and is got where there is but ju&s;t room and tide enough to drive broad&s;ide, which may make a great deal of differ|ence in the &s;hip's driving according to the wind and tide; for if we &s;uppo&s;e the wind blows &s;o fre&s;h that the &s;hip cannot be made to go le&s;s than at the rate of two miles an hour, through the water, when driving &s;tern foremo&s;t, the tide mu&s;t run at the rate of three miles, to make her drive one mile an hour to windward, but where the tide runs but two miles an hour, the &s;hip will then be at a &s;tand between wind and tide, but when &s;he is brought to, and drives broad&s;ide, as repre&s;ented by figure 2. &s;he may not drive above half a mile through the water; &s;o that what is the difference between that and what the tide goes, &s;he will drive to windward.</P>
<P>A SHIP may drive &s;tern foremo&s;t without any &s;ail, as &s;he only, requires &s;teerage way to command her, and the le&s;s way &s;he has through the water, the fa&s;ter &s;he will drive, &s;o that when it blows fre&s;h, to contrive and make &s;top waters may be of &s;ervice to help her to windward. But to bring a &s;hip to, where there is little room, &s;o as to drive broad&s;ide, will require the three top&s;ails, the mizen, and the jib and foretopma&s;t &s;tay&s;ail, to be ready to hoi&s;t, to make her manageable to back, or fill, &s;tay, or ware, as may be requir|ed; for to endeavour to bring a &s;hip to without &s;ail to throw a-back occa&s;ionally, &s;he would perhaps &s;hoot on that &s;hore a-head before &s;he lo&s;es her headway.</P>
<P>NOW let us &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;hip figure 1. plate the 3d. after driving &s;tern foremo&s;t as above mentioned, has &s;et her top&s;ails bra|ced &s;harp up with the larboard braces, in order to bring to, and drive broad&s;ide on the larboard tack. In this ca&s;e the &s;hip &s;hould be &s;heered as near the &s;tarboard &s;hore as &s;he po&s;&s;ibly can with &s;afe|ty, then put the helm hard a-&s;tarboard, hauling out the mizen as &s;oon as it will take the right way, &s;o as to bring the &s;hip round to,
<PB N="57" REF="70">
with the top&s;ails a-back, to prevent her &s;hooting too near the lar|board &s;hore.</P>
<P>A SHIP bringing to with much headway, will bring the wind near|ly right a-head, by the time the headway cea&s;es; then the helm &s;hould be &s;hifted hard a-weather, and the &s;ails being a-back, will &s;oon give her great &s;ternway, by which means a &s;ternboard may be made to back her as near the &s;hore a-&s;tern as po&s;&s;ible; for, as it has been ob&s;erved, a &s;hip driving broad&s;ide may ea&s;ily be &s;hot a-head, when &s;he cannot be backed a-&s;tern, and this is the only time a &s;ternboard can be made to advantage at the &s;hip's bringing to; for when the &s;ternway cea&s;es, the helm mu&s;t be put and kept hard a-lee, and the &s;hip mu&s;t drive with the main and mizen top&s;ails a-back, the mizen hauled out, and the foretop&s;ail kept &s;hivering, as is repre&s;ented figure 2. plate the 3d. and if the mizen &s;tay&s;ail was &s;et with the &s;heet to windward, it might help to keep her more to the wind, &s;o that &s;he might drive the farther on one tack, before you are obliged to ware her to drive on the other tack, which mu&s;t be done as &s;oon as the &s;hip is perceived to draw near the &s;hore a-head, which will always be the ca&s;e with a &s;hip driving right to windward, for the rea&s;ons given.</P>
<P>WHEN you intend to ware as a &s;hip is always coming to, and falling off, by her head and &s;ternway when thus driving, take the oppor|tunity, when &s;he has ju&s;t done falling off by her &s;ternway, as &s;he is then as far a-&s;tern as &s;he will be upon that tack, and the wind as far aft, being then all ready, up mizen, down mizen &s;tay&s;ail, (if &s;et) &s;hiver the main and mizen top&s;ails, fill flat the foretop&s;ail, up jib and foretopma&s;t &s;tay&s;ail, (if nece&s;&s;ary) &s;hift the helm hard a-weather, the tide then &s;etting round the &s;tern, as is repre&s;ented by the &s;hip's wake and boat to windward figure 2, it will act with &s;uch power upon the rudder in that direction, that with the fir&s;t of her headway, the &s;hip may be wared, and proceeding as before, brought to, &s;o as to drive on the other rack; in this manner a &s;hip may be managed, to change tacks, and drive right to windward with the Tide, in le&s;s room than any one would think po&s;&s;ible that has not had the experience.</P>
<P>BUT in&s;tead of waring as la&s;t mentioned, I cannot help thinking it would be better to put the &s;hip in &s;tays, filling the after &s;ails flat, keeping the foretop&s;ail ju&s;t drawing full, till the &s;hip comes to, &s;o that it will take a-back to help her about, and if &s;he &s;tays, let the helm lie, as it will then be, a-weather; the &s;hip may then be back|ed, by making a &s;ternboard towards the &s;hore a-&s;tern, at plea&s;ure;
<PB N="58" REF="71">
and if &s;he refu&s;es &s;tays, it gives a favourable opportunity to brace the top&s;ails a-back, and box-haul her round, as has been de&s;cribed page 53, by which &s;he will lo&s;e le&s;s ground than by wareing, and the &s;hip's trim may require this practice, as it is known that loaded colliers will &s;tay when they will not ware, and when light in bal|la&s;t, they will ware when they will not &s;tay.</P>

<HEAD>On bringing a Ship to an Anchor.</HEAD>
<P>VARIOUS &s;ituations and different &s;orts of harbours, roads, and coa&s;ts, different directions and &s;trength of winds, waves, and tides, make it impo&s;&s;ible to fix certain rules to bring a &s;hip pro|perly to an anchor, at all times and places. Yet in my opinion, a great deal may be &s;aid on this &s;ubject, that de&s;erves notice. And fir&s;t it may be nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome remarks on coiling cables.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>On Coiling CABLES.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be the lo&s;s of a &s;hip, to coil a new cable with the &s;un, as it is termed, before it is properly &s;tretched, or the end taken through the coil, for it is almo&s;t &s;ure to come up in kinks when yeered out, and e&s;pecially in cold weather. The greate&s;t depen|dence being on new cables, they are commonly kept in re&s;erve till the other cables, or the anchors, give way, which makes this bad practice in coiling them the more dangerous; therefore it &s;hould be fir&s;t con&s;idered, how to manage the cables, to make them work and coil to the be&s;t advantage, and run clear of catch &s;akes as well as kinks.</P>
<P>A CABLE, in my opinion, works and wears much better for be|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iled the &s;ame way that it runs round the windla&s;s, or bitts. Therefore the cables for the &s;tarboard anchors, which work round the windla&s;s again&s;t the &s;un, &s;hould be coiled again&s;t the &s;un, and tho&s;e for the larboard anchors coiled with the &s;un, as they work that way round a windla&s;s, and as they run out round the bitts the contrary way, &s;o that the cables &s;hould be coiled accordingly. And to make new cables an&s;wer this practice, is, the fir&s;t time, to coil them with the &s;un, over the cable tier hatchway, with larger o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> le&s;s &s;akes, according to the limberne&s;s or &s;tiffne&s;s of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ope, and take the upper end through the coil, to coil it down in the tier; this will make the rope pliable to coil, and veer out ea&s;y, clear of kinks, either with or again&s;t the &s;un.</P>
<P>TO coil a cable to run clear of catch &s;akes, the cable &s;hould al|ways be laid out from the in&s;ide &s;ake to the out&s;ide &s;ake, at the
<PB N="60" REF="73">
farther end of the cable tier, farthe&s;t from the hatchway; this will likewi&s;e coil the cable &s;o nuch lower in that part near the hatchway, &s;o as to give more room and height to bend and coil the cable, and for the bends to up&s;et clear when veering away.</P>
<P>THE bad cu&s;tom of coiling cables with the &s;un, &s;o as to run in kinks proceeds fir&s;t from the rope-makers, who for their ea&s;e, coil them that way to &s;end them to the &s;hip, where, without thought, they are too commonly coiled down the cable tier the &s;ame way, becau&s;e a new cable before it is well &s;tretched, will always bend of it&s;elf that way in coiling, for the rope opening again&s;t the lay, gets clear of a turn at the bend of every fake, which is the rea&s;on that a new cable bends and coils &s;o ea&s;y this way; but when this cable comes to be veered out, this turn mu&s;t come into the cable again at the up&s;etting of every bend; but the lay of the rope inclines it to keep clear of this turn, which prevents the fakes from up&s;etting, and cau&s;es it to come up in kinks, by which bad practice I have known many narrow e&s;capes. Therefore all new cable-laid ropes, haw&s;ers, and towlines, as well as cables that require to run clear of kinks, &s;hould be either coiled again&s;t the &s;un, till they are well &s;tretched, or with the &s;un, and the end taken through the coil as before mentioned; for the &s;ame rea&s;on, as it is well known, that a coil of new rigging will not run clear of kinks, without the end is properly taken through the coil. But to coil a new cable again&s;t the &s;un, that is from the right hand to the left, requires a turn to be forced into the lay of the rope, at the bend of every &s;ake, which makes it trouble&s;ome to coil this way; but this turn in every fake, makes the bends up&s;et of them&s;elves, &s;o that the cable veers out very ea&s;y.</P>
<P>NOW if we may &s;uppo&s;e that the anchors and cables are all ready, &s;o as to be &s;ure of running clear: The next things to be con&s;idered, are the depth of water, the room, &s;trength of the wind, waves or tide, where you expect to anchor; al&s;o that the buoy and buoy rope, range of cable, hand&s;pikes, &s;toppers, ring-ropes, and buckets of water to throw on the windla&s;s or bitts, be all ready, as occa&s;ion may require, and to give as great a &s;cope of cable as the place will permit, before you offer to bring the &s;hip up, becau&s;e the length and weight of the cable, will contribute greatly to ea&s;e both the an|chor and cable, as well as the &s;hip, when the waves run high, for which rea&s;on, I have known &s;hips have the inner ends of the &s;heet and be&s;t bower cables &s;pliced together, &s;o that by over&s;etting one cable, they could vear out both upon one end, to either anchor, if
<PB N="61" REF="74">
nece&s;&s;ity required it, for it is well known, in a &s;torm when the waves run high, and e&s;pecially in deep water, that a &s;hip will ride much ea&s;ier and longer by two cables, or more, upon one end, to one good anchor, than by two anchors with a &s;ingle cable to each. For to ride by two anchors, they mu&s;t lie far enough a&s;under on each bow, to prevent one anchor from hurting the other cable, by which a &s;hip &s;eldom pulls hard upon both cables at the &s;ame time, but fir&s;t pulls hard upon one cable; if but a &s;hort &s;cope, it plunges her deep into the &s;ea; then that &s;train draws the &s;hip towards that anchor, which &s;lackens that cable; &s;o that by the next wave &s;he &s;trains hard upon the other cable, and &s;o on &s;he pulls fir&s;t at one and then at the other, which cau&s;es a &s;hip to labour, and be very unea&s;y in the waves, in compari&s;on to what &s;he would be, if riding by one good anchor and a great &s;cope of cable, which admits the &s;hip to fall and ri&s;e ea&s;y with the waves, without hauling the whole length and weight of the cable off the ground, which makes the anchor hold longer without coming home.</P>
<P>IN letting go an anchor, care &s;hould be taken that the &s;hip does not hurt her&s;elf upon it, in ca&s;e of &s;hole water, and that the an|chor is not fouled by the cable getting about the fluke or &s;tock of the anchor, which may prevent its holding the &s;hip when any &s;train comes upon it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>To come to an Anchor when the Wind is right again&s;t the Tide.</HEAD>
<P>IT &s;hould be a rule to &s;hoot the &s;hip a-head of the anchor, or &s;heer her clear of it, upon the &s;ame tack you de&s;ign to &s;hoot her upon, the next tide, endeavouring always to keep the &s;hip in &s;winging with the tide on one &s;ide of the anchor, to keep clear of it, for rea&s;ons that will be given in its place on keeping a clear an|chor. As it is repre&s;ented plate the 3d. it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;hip driving to windward has got to an anchoring birth, or the tide is &s;o far &s;pent that &s;he will drive no farther, to windward, and mu&s;t come to an anchor on the &s;tarboard tack. In this ca&s;e at let|ting go the anchor, the &s;hip &s;hould be &s;hot a-head of it, and kept a-head with the helm a-weather, and the yards braced full with the larboard braces, and the foretopma&s;t-&s;tay&s;ail and mizen &s;et full, as is repre&s;ented by figure 3, plate the 3d. till the windward tide is

<P>WHERE there is room, it is certainly nece&s;&s;ary to full the &s;quare &s;ails, as the &s;hip is running before the wind and tide, and to take room to bring her to, by putting the helm hard over to &s;tarboard or port, and haul out the mizen to bring the &s;hip's head up as much as po&s;&s;ible, again&s;t the wind and tide, at letting go the anchor, which will contribute greatly to bring the &s;hip up with &s;afe|ty and ea&s;e, compared with that bad practice of letting go the an|chor as the &s;hip runs right before the wind and tide, without hand|ing the &s;quare &s;ails, which adds all that extraordinary force of the &s;hip's way through the water, to the &s;trength of the wind and tide, which increa&s;es the &s;train and rubs the cable to a dangerous degree, by which I have &s;een great damage done, as breaking the cable, &amp;c. which might have been avoided by bringing the &s;hip to, and letting go the anchor as above recommended.</P>
<P>THE damage that is often done on this occa&s;ion, proceeds from want of con&s;ideration; for as it has been ob&s;erved before, a &s;hip &s;ailing right before the wind, and a &s;trong tide, does not feel the real &s;trength of the wind; therefore apprehending no danger, lets go the anchor as the &s;hip runs, which if it does not make &s;ome|thing give way, mu&s;t greatly &s;train every thing that is immediately concerned in bringing the &s;hip up.</P>

<P>WHERE it can be done, the &s;hip &s;hould be always put upon that tack that &s;tems again&s;t the tide, when the anchor is let go; and if it is de&s;igned to continue at a &s;ingle anchor, in or|der to keep it clear, I would recommend to &s;heer and keep the &s;hip to leeward of the anchor, by keeping the helm a-weather, and

<P>GREAT advantages may attend letting go the anchor &s;teming a|gain&s;t the tide, and e&s;pecially where the tide runs over rapid, for it gives an opportunity to take notice at what rate the &s;hip may be going a-&s;tern, &s;o as to judge whether it may not be nece&s;&s;ary to keep &s;ail &s;et, in order to help to bring the &s;hip up, and ride ea&s;y in a rapid tide. I have been where we let go the &s;mall bower anchor, with all &s;ails &s;et, with a fre&s;h breeze of wind again&s;t the tide, and veered out the whole cable, and the &s;hip &s;till drove; then we let go the be&s;t bower anchor and veered out all that cable, by which the &s;hip brought up; and road &s;o clo&s;e to a &s;hole a-&s;tern, that we were obliged to ride with the helm a-port, to keep the &s;hip with a broad &s;heer, to prevent her touching the ground, which would have been fatal to the whole: the rapid tide would have over&s;et the &s;hip, broke away her ma&s;ts, and turned her over and over upon the &s;hole, which would probably have been the ca&s;e, had it not been for the &s;ails being kept &s;et, which helped to bring the &s;hip up and ride.</P>

<HEAD>To keep a clear Anchor when the Wind is right a-cro&s;s the Tide.</HEAD>
<P>I STRONGLY recommend the &s;imple and ea&s;y method of &s;etting the foretopma&s;t &s;tay&s;ail with the weather &s;heet flat aft, and the helm a-weather, whereby the &s;hip may be &s;heered, and kept near the &s;ame place to leeward clear of her anchor, both &s;tood and ebb, as repre&s;ented by the &s;hip figure 1, where &s;he naturally mu&s;t be each &s;lack tide in the &s;ituation as repre&s;ented by the &s;hip figure 2, plate the 4th. But this method of &s;heering a &s;hip to leeward, being quite contrary to that bad cu&s;tom which is practiced in the coal trade, of &s;heering &s;hips to windward of their anchor, and though I allow them to be the greate&s;t proficients in managing &s;hips in narrow and diffi|cult channels, hope to convince them that their practice in this in|&s;tance is wrong. But Dame Cu&s;tom, I know from experience, is a powerful adver&s;ary, and a great enemy to improvements, and will &s;eldom &s;ubmit to conviction; notwith&s;tanding that, I &s;hall endea|vour to make a fair compari&s;on, by de&s;cribing both methods, as they are repre&s;ented in plate the 4th, which was made for this pur|po&s;e only, and then leave the merit of both to the determination of impartial judges. Fir&s;t, then let us &s;uppo&s;e the wind to be off &s;hore, and right a-cro&s;s the tide, as is repre&s;ented plate the 4th, and that the &s;hip figure 1, is commanded be Capt. Rea&s;on, and came to an anchor on the larboard tack, fleming again&s;t the tide, as de&s;cribed page 62, with her helm a-weather, to &s;heer the &s;hip to leeward of the anchor, which method not only keeps the &s;hip clear of her an|chor, but al&s;o makes her ride &s;o near end on to the tide, with the wind rather abaft the beam, that &s;he may be helped with &s;ail, to ride ea&s;ier in a rapid tide; and when the tide is moderate, &s;he will lie &s;heered right to leeward of her anchor, where &s;he mu&s;t be at each &s;lack tide, as has been before ob&s;erved. And if we &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he came to an anchor at &s;lack tide, as de&s;cribed page 62, &s;he will then lie with the cable and anchor in the &s;ame direction, with the wind right a-head; &s;o that when either tide makes, &s;o as to bring the wind upon the bow, they have only to hoi&s;t the foretop|ma&s;t &s;tay&s;ail, with the &s;heet to windward, and put the helm a-wea|ther,

<P>Now we will &s;uppo&s;e Dame Cu&s;tom commanding the &s;hip figure 3, in the &s;ame plate, comes to an anchor on the &s;tarboard tack, &s;teming again&s;t the tide, and puts the helm a lee, which &s;heers the &s;hip, and lays her anchor in a &s;lanting direction to windward, as repre&s;ented by figure 3, till the tide begins to &s;lack; then &s;ets the mizentop&s;ail a-back, and in little wind &s;ometimes adds the maintop|&s;ail a-back, to back the &s;hip a-&s;tern clear of her anchor, which makes her form a &s;weep half round her anchor, according to her &s;cope of cable, from her being near right to windward to right to leeward of her anchor, as repre&s;ented from figure 3, to figure 2, where the &s;hip mu&s;t naturally lie in that &s;ituation every &s;lack tide, with the wind and anchor right a-head, till the other tide makes; then they &s;hift the helm a-lee, braces a-back the mizentop&s;ail and yards, &amp;c. and &s;heer the &s;hip nearly right to windward, to complete almo&s;t the circle quite round her anchor every tide, as repre&s;ented from figure 3, to figure 4, where it appears plain, the &s;hip is made to take up above twice the room of the &s;hip figure 1, con&s;equently in that proportion her cable rubs over twice as much ground, and is more liable to &s;weep foul of &s;tones, wreck, or lo&s;t anchors, &amp;c. which may greatly hurt it, and it may get under the upper fluke of her own anchor, if the anchor does not turn in the ground as the &s;hip is &s;heered round it, which probably will be done at the la&s;t and fir&s;t part of the tide, when it runs ea&s;y; when if the wind is mode|rate, and the bottom a tough clay, it is great chance but the anchor lies with the &s;tock to windward, by the &s;train upon it in that direc|tion, as above mentioned, and the cable may go over the &s;tock when lying flat upon the ground, as the &s;hip was backed to leeward of the anchor, and may &s;weep under the upper fluke as &s;he is &s;heered to windward again, which makes it evident, that by this practice, Dame Cu&s;tom is likely to ride with the cable foul of the upper fluke of the anchor, as repre&s;ented figure 4. And to &s;up|po&s;e the wind and tide &s;o moderate, that the &s;hip does not drive, yet the &s;train upon the upper fluke may cant it towards the &s;hip, and rai&s;e the farther &s;tock arm off the ground, by which in a clay bottom, the anchor may perhaps lie in that po&s;ition, &s;o that when the tide &s;lacks, and the &s;hip is backed from figure 4, to figure 2, it will clear the cable of the anchor &s;luke; and as they &s;heet to wind|ward again, from figure 2, to figure 3, the cable is likely to &s;weep under the anchor &s;tock arm, that lies canted off the ground.

<P>AGAIN &s;uppo&s;e Dame Cu&s;tom comes to an anchor at &s;lack tide, the anchor will naturally lie in the &s;ame direction with the &s;hip and wind right a-head; and when the tide makes, in&s;tead of keeping the &s;hip to leeward, as repre&s;ented figure 1, then old Dame &s;heers and lies to windward of the anchor, as above mentioned; and &s;up|po&s;e the wind to change, and come &s;o far a-baft the beam that the &s;hip cannot be backed a-&s;tern of her anchor, but &s;hoots a-head as the tide &s;lacks, in this ca&s;e, if it is good holding ground, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that the anchor has not turned in the ground as the &s;hip has gone round it; the cable will then naturally &s;weep the upper fluke of the anchor, &s;o that Dame Cu&s;tom is likely to be a-drift with the lee tide, if it blows fre&s;h, or the tide runs &s;trong, and may carry other &s;hips a-drift with them, which makes it dangerous for Rea&s;on to lie near Dame Cu&s;tom, in crowded road&s;teeds, which mu&s;t make great confu&s;ion when one &s;heers their &s;hip to lee|ward, and the other to windward of their anchor, they may &s;heer on board each other, which I have known to be the ca&s;e, and Dame Cu&s;tom has then abu&s;ed Rea&s;on, by calling him lubber, for &s;heering the &s;hip to leeward of her anchor, when Rea&s;on, who had ob&s;erved their wrong proceedings, wagered in his own defence, that Dame Cu&s;tom's anchor was then &s;oul, which proved to be &s;o at heaving up.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;o much to be &s;aid again&s;t this bad cu&s;tom, of &s;heering to windward of the anchor, that I am &s;urpri&s;ed how it came into pract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, as nothing rea&s;onable has appeared to me could be urged in favour of it: even in re&s;pect to work, to wear, and tear, all are greatly again&s;t it; &s;o that I would advi&s;e every &s;hip, commanded by Rea&s;on, to re&s;ort and lie together, as far from the adherents of Dame Cu&s;tom as the room in the place will admit of, as they all &s;heer one way to leeward of their anchors, they may lie with much more &s;afety clear of each other, in le&s;s than hall the compa&s;s of ground that Dame Cu&s;tom takes up, as is made evident by plate the 4th, which I hope will prove &s;ufficient to condemn the practice.</P>

<P>RULES cannot be fixed to &s;uit all places and all &s;hips, but different methods may be nece&s;&s;ary, according to the road, the &s;ize of the &s;hip, her draft of water, and how &s;he may be pro|vided with ground tackle, &amp;c. Where the tide runs very &s;trong, and there is water enough, it is certainly be&s;t to moor water &s;hot, the anchors and cables lying in the &s;ame direction with the tide, which can then have but little effect upon them, in compari&s;on to what it has when a &s;hip is moored a-cro&s;s the tide, where the pow|er of the tide alone upon the moorings, is of it&s;elf &s;ometimes enough to bring the anchors home. Therefore great &s;hips that have &s;heet anchors, and are well manned to clear the haw&s;e, when obliged to lie where the tide runs &s;trong, moor with the be&s;t and &s;mall bower anchors, water &s;hot; but &s;mall &s;hips, having only two bower an|chors, and but few hands to clear haw&s;e, drawing le&s;s water, may moor out of the &s;trength of the tide, with the &s;mall bower and &s;tream anchor, and haw&s;er a-thwart the tide, and keep the be&s;t bower anchor in re&s;erve, as occa&s;ion may require.</P>
<P>WHEN a &s;hip is to be moored only to wait for a fair wind, the be&s;t anchor, and open haw&s;e, &s;hould be towards the foul wind quar|ter; but when a &s;hip is to lie with all winds that may blow, the be&s;t anchor and open haw&s;e &s;hould be towards the wor&s;t wind that may blow, to rai&s;e the waves, and give the &s;hip a pitching motion, as is mentioned page 65, and mu&s;t leave no more of the &s;malle&s;t moorings within board, than ju&s;t enough to fre&s;hen the haw&s;e on occa&s;ion; by which they will hold the longer, by having the longer &s;cope, and the haw&s;e will be the ea&s;ier cleared.</P>
<P>WHERE a &s;hip is liable to ground with the ebb, and not to float till the flood tide runs &s;trong, the &s;afe&s;t method is to moor a-cro&s;s
<PB N="74" REF="87">
the tide, which lays the &s;hip clear from getting damage upon her own anchors; then it requires to attend and &s;lack the mooring, that her &s;tern may &s;wing over upon the flood, to prevent her girting. And when moored with a &s;mall anchor and haw&s;er, the helm &s;hould be always &s;hifted, to &s;heer her towards the &s;mall anchor, to ea&s;e the &s;train upon the &s;mall moorings; and to lay the principal &s;tre&s;s upon the bower anchor and cable, to ride the &s;hip when the tide runs &s;trong.</P>
<P>I HAVE been mooring a &s;hip in a very narrow river, where the &s;hore on each &s;ide was nothing but loo&s;e &s;hilly &s;tones.

<P>AS &s;afety may often depend upon this, not only when the waves run high, but in &s;mooth water where the tide runs &s;trong, and by giving the moorings a trembling motion, may chaif them; therefore care &s;hould be taken to have them well &s;erved, not only in the way of the haw&s;e and cut-water, but &s;o far as to reach below the gripe; for a &s;hip moored water &s;hot, or at a &s;ingle anchor, with a windward tide, when it blows &s;o fre&s;h that &s;he ran|ges about, and lies a-head of her anchor, with a tight cable, which may be hurt under the bows and gripe, if not &s;erved low enough. Therefore it is certainly be&s;t to have the cables properly &s;erved, ready for mooring, as the time and place the &s;hip is to lie in may require, as our <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> &s;hips in the pa&s;&s;age home, when in a fine weather climate, put the proper &s;ervice on their mooring cables; and in the coal trade to <HI>London,</HI> they put on their cables what they call a long and &s;hort &s;ervice, to continue on for the &s;ummer's work.</P>

makes openings between the parts of the plat, &s;o that the cable may be chaifed in the&s;e openings, which a leather &s;ervice is not &s;ubject to, being all the length of the hide in one piece.

But if &s;itu|ated among a crowd of &s;hips, or near the &s;hore, then it requires to look about, and con&s;ider well to take up that anchor fir&s;t, that gives the cleare&s;t birth to ca&s;t the &s;hip, or get her under way in the mo&s;t advantageous manner, clear of the dangers that may be near. For want of conduct on &s;uch occa&s;ions, I have known great damage done.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved in the addre&s;s, what was &s;aid by the celebrated Doctor Halley, that the Sy&s;tem of navigation in his time, depended upon three L's, Lead, Latitude, and Look-out, each of which de|&s;erve particular notice, as &s;afety in my opinion will always greatly depend upon them.</P>

<HEAD>On heaving the HAND-LEAD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS method of &s;ounding the depth of water is peculiar to our &s;eamen, and I judge had its ri&s;e in the coa&s;ting and coal trade to <HI>London,</HI> where their &s;ucce&s;s and &s;afety depend greatly upon it; and which make them &s;o dexterous, by their great practice, &s;o

that they will heave the lead far enough to reach the bottom, and give true &s;oundings in eleven or twelve fathom water, when the &s;hip may be going at the rate of four or five knots through the wa|ter; and their rules are equal to their dexterity, and which de&s;erve mentioning, and &s;hould in my opinion be followed as &s;tandard rules for the hand lead, for want of which being properly u&s;ed, I have known many misfortunes and fatal lo&s;&s;es, which might have been avoided. I have heard of a commander of a large &s;hip, in the a|bove coal trade, who in dangerous places always hove the lead him|&s;elf; and cunned, or ordered the &s;hip about, according to the &s;ound|ings, which he &s;ung, or &s;poke out aloud as the other men.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Rules commonly ob&s;erved by a good Leads-Man.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN fir&s;t ordered to the lead, he takes care that the in|ward end of the line is made fa&s;t, to prevent loo&s;ing it. 2d. That the lead and line may run clear, and come fair to hand, he takes them out before that &s;hrowd next to his foremo&s;t hand where he &s;tands to heave. 3d. The fir&s;t ca&s;t of the lead he only heaves out about &s;ix or &s;even fathom of line, which prevents the lead be|ing over hove, and readily makes known that the &s;hip is not in im|mediate danger, when no ground is found at that depth; and it is an ea&s;y way to clear the line for a deeper ca&s;t the next heave, if the occa&s;ion requires it. 4th. When &s;ounding in le&s;s than five fa|thom water, or when there happens a &s;udden alteration of le&s;s wa|ter, he heaves the lead as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;peaks out the &s;ound|ing bri&s;kly, with a loud voice, and does not &s;ing them out, which takes &s;o much time that I have known a &s;hip to come a-ground be|fore the &s;ounding was made known.</P>

<HEAD>On &s;inging out the SOUNDINGS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS cu&s;tom is certainly a benefit to a fleet of &s;hips, &s;ailing near together in difficult channels, where &s;afety depends upon the lead, as in the coal trade to <HI>London,</HI> where I &s;uppo&s;e the prac|tice: began; and finding the advantage of hearing each others &s;ound|ings as a guide to the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="92">ANOTHER advantage attending this practice, is, where a com|mander is not well acquainted, he may go of the deck, and look at the &s;oundings laid down in the chart, or in&s;tructions for the place, and hear the depth of water &s;ung out at the &s;ame time to compare how they agree.</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t be allowed that there are ri&s;ks attending this practice, by the lead's-man &s;tanding &s;till all the time he is &s;inging out the &s;oundings; for which rea&s;on the above 4th rule for a good lead's-man, &s;hould be &s;trictly ob&s;erved, to avoid the danger there menti|oned, to have happened whil&s;t the lead's-man was &s;inging out the &s;oundings, with a long tone, thus, <HI>bee, thee, mark, three,</HI> &amp;c. in which time the &s;hip came a-ground, which might have been avoid|ed, had the &s;oundings been &s;poke out quick, as above recommend|ed.

<HEAD>On Sounding with the DEEPSEA LEAD.</HEAD>
<P>I WOULD recommend what I have found from experience to be an advantage, that is, having this lead only fifteen pounds weight, with a &s;maller line than common kept ready upon a reel, made large enough for the purpo&s;e, like a log reel, and hung up in beckets, where a man can readily take and hold it between his hands, on any &s;udden occa&s;ion; and that the lead may &s;ink the fa&s;ter, to have &s;mall and few marks, as the hand-lead and line will get &s;oundings at any time, in ten fathom water; the deep&s;ea line need only be marked from ten to &s;eventeen fathom, as common, and from twenty upwards with knots as &s;mall as tho&s;e in the log-line.</P>
<P>THIS lead requires various methods of heaving it, according to the depth of water expected, and the &s;hip's head or lee way at the time the lead is to be hove When a &s;hip is &s;ailing right an end, without much lee way, if &s;oundings cannot be got by heaving it from the cat head, or &s;prit&s;ail yard, a man mu&s;t carry the bight of the line to the jibboom end, and with a tight line &s;wing the lead forward, when a man gives it all the force he can from the &s;prit|&s;ail

<HEAD>To bring a Ship too to Sound.</HEAD>
<P>THE difficulty of getting true &s;oundings, in a gale of wind, in|crea&s;es in proportion to the depth of water, and the violence of the wind and waves. The be&s;t method that I have experienced, is to pa&s;s the lead from the weather quarter, round the &s;tern to lee|ward, without all to the fore part of the quarter deck; and a man to carry the bight of the line to the lee main yard arm, which is to be laid &s;quare when the helm is put a-lee, to bring the &s;hip too; and when the &s;hip begins to &s;hoot to windward by her head way, then the lead is to be &s;wung right to leeward from the deck, whil&s;t the man at the yard arm, with a tight line, &s;wings it as far as po&s;&s;i|ble to leeward of the &s;hip, which gains to windward of the lead whil&s;t the head way continues, and then runs her &s;tern up to the wind by the &s;ternway, backs near to where the lead was hove, by which means, as mentioned in box hauling page 53, a great deal of line may be run out, nearly up and down; and the lead being armed with tallow, makes it certain whether it has &s;truck the bot|tom or no, and if it has, &s;hews what &s;ort of a bottom there is.</P>
<P>WHEN and how oft it may be nece&s;&s;ary to try for &s;oundings, mu&s;t be left to the di&s;cretion of the commanding officer, and will be more or le&s;s &s;o, according to the nature of the coa&s;t, place, or &s;ituation of the &s;hip; the want of it being done in due time, is well known to have occa&s;ioned many fatal lo&s;&s;es.

Be|ing all of us &s;trangers, we traced the coa&s;t clo&s;e along &s;hore by day, and laid the &s;hip to at night; thus we &s;earched for the place &s;o long in vain, that we de&s;paired of finding it, therefore it was re&s;olved to try if it was po&s;&s;ible to turn the &s;hip to windward, again&s;t a lee cur|rent then running, and go to <HI>Gibralter</HI> to get a pilot to find the place, when in our way back, we found it was above a degree of latitude to the northward of where we had ever looked for it, owing to its being wrong laid down in the chart, and to our officers not getting every po&s;&s;ible information, concerning a place where we were not acquainted before proceeding on the voyage.</P>

<P>A GOOD look out may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to contribute more than a|ny thing towards &s;afety, not only from &s;hores or &s;hoals, &amp;c. but from &s;hips running on board each other at &s;ea, which no doubt often has, and may prove fatal to all tho&s;e who neglect it. There|fore the utmo&s;t care &s;hould be taken, that this duty is not done in a carele&s;s manner; and the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors &s;hould be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>I WAS in a &s;hip, in company with a fleet of &s;hips of war, turning to windward in the night, with a fre&s;h breeze of wind, when our mate of the watch, as walking the weather &s;ide of the quarter deck, was alarmed with hearing called out from another &s;hip, "a good lookout before there," and an an&s;wer made by &s;everal "aye, aye," &mdash;the mate ran to leeward, looked under the main&s;ail, and &s;aw a frigate on the other tack running right on board us; her jibboom run within our lee mizen &s;hrouds, and tore them all away; her &s;heet anchor fluke took our main chain plates, tore them all away, and plowed away the plank and timbers till it got clear through our &s;hip's &s;ide, before one &s;hip &s;topt the others way; and were &s;o locked and entangled together, that had it been a ruff, in&s;tead of a &s;mooth &s;ea, as it happened to be, one or both &s;hips mu&s;t have &s;unk, before they could have been got clear of each other.</P>
<P>THIS &s;hews, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trict di&s;cipline u&s;ed on board our King's &s;hips, that this important duty is negligently done there, as well as in other &s;hips, by carele&s;s men not con&s;idering how much depends upon their looking out, when &s;culking or diverting them|&s;elves with &s;tories upon the foreca&s;tle; they without looking out at all, will an&s;wer regularly to the word of command, aye, aye, which occa&s;ioned the above misfortune. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, as long as the weather permits, the lookers out &s;tationed on deck, &s;hould be made to walk each man by him&s;elf, which will prevent them from being diverted, or &s;leeping on this duty; for it is well known that a man may &s;tand and &s;leep, but he cannot walk and &s;leep; and to make this duty both ea&s;y and well done, it &s;hould be taken &s;pell and &s;pell, according to the number of the watch that can be tru&s;ted, and as circum&s;tances may require.</P>

<P>TO prevent being deceived on this occa&s;ion, I think it nece&s;&s;ary here to remark, that when any light appears in the horrizon, or near the water's edge, that it cannot be a &s;tar, for the atmo&s;phere or air &s;o ob&s;cures the &s;tars, that they cannot be &s;een to ri&s;e or &s;et in the horrizon. When drawing near to any danger, where &s;afety may depend entirely on a good look out, if the weather permits, and the &s;hip is manageable, and will work under her top&s;ails, with the main&s;ail and fore&s;ail in the brales, it gives a fair opening for the officer as well as others upon deck, to look round them, to &s;ee any dangers as may appear. The little difference thus made in the &s;hip's &s;ailing, is not to be compared with the advantage given for &s;afety, or preventing damage on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>A Good helm&s;man, when a &s;hip is difficult to be &s;teered, at taking the helm, he fir&s;t ob&s;erves how it lies, then looks with a &s;harp eye which way the &s;hip is inclined to go from her cour&s;e, and moves the helm with a bri&s;k motion far enough to &s;top her that way, and feels by the &s;tre&s;s upon the rudder cea&s;ing, (which feel ought always to be noticed, as well as any alteration to the eye) when it is a proper time to ea&s;e the helm to prevent her from going on the other &s;ide of her cour&s;e, for a &s;hip is no &s;ooner &s;topt by the helm from going to one hand, than &s;he will be inclinable to go to the other hand, if the helm is let lie in that place, therefore he keeps moving the helm with a bri&s;k motion, as far as is found nece&s;&s;ary, to confine her to the cour&s;e, and by feeling the marked &s;pokes of the wheel, as they come into his hands, &s;oon perceives how much helm, and how far &s;he requires it each way, to com|mand and &s;teer her &s;teadily along, with the lea&s;t helm, and trou|ble to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A BAD helm&s;man in&s;tead of endeavouring to confine the &s;hip to her cour&s;e, by moving the helm each way as above-mentioned, commonly lets the helm lie until he &s;ees the &s;hip is got on one &s;ide of her cour&s;e, then moves it &s;o far as to bring her to her cour&s;e again before he offers to &s;top or meet her with it, and then &s;he gets on the other &s;ide of her cour&s;e, &s;o as to require a great deal of helm both ways, by that the &s;hip is &s;teered but little right forward, but kept yawing about from one &s;ide of her cour&s;e to the other, which &s;hortens the di&s;tance gone, and makes both cour&s;e and di|&s;tance very uncertain, and works the bad helm&s;man as he works the &s;hip from &s;ide to &s;ide, which makes both very unea&s;y, and if the waves run high, when carrying a pre&s;&s;ing &s;ail large, by bad &s;teering there is great danger of broaching the &s;hip to, therefore none but the be&s;t helm&s;men &s;hould be permitted to &s;teer at &s;uch times.</P>

<P>IN a variable wind's way, when a &s;hip has got &s;ea room, clear of the land, I have thought it a wrong practice, to &s;teer upon a wind, by the vanes, and &s;ails ju&s;t touching full, which &s;eldom gives a direct cour&s;e, but varies as the &s;hip comes to, and falls off, which makes both cour&s;e and di&s;tance the more uncertain; there|fore a cour&s;e &s;hould be ordered to a point, or half a point of the compa&s;s, as the wind will admit, to &s;teer the &s;hip with a full &s;ail, and only look at the vanes to &s;ee if the wind alters, that the cour&s;e may be altered accordingly, by this means, a truer cour&s;e as well as di&s;tance, and more di&s;tance may be got, e&s;pecially if the &s;hip lies a &s;lant towards her true cour&s;e, which makes it the more nece&s;|&s;ary as the &s;hip will &s;ail the fa&s;ter, and make le&s;s lee-way, and this la&s;t &s;hould be well con&s;idered, becau&s;e the &s;hip's real cour&s;e by the compa&s;s, depends much upon making a proper allowance for her lee-way.</P>

<P>THIS, in a mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent manner, is generally left for 24 hours, to the judgment and memories of the different naviga|tors,
<PB N="108" REF="121">
who probably are below, a&s;leep, or their attention taken up with other things great part of the time, this therefore mu&s;t make the al|lowance for lee-way very uncertain, as it is liable to vary, and be more or le&s;s every hour, as the wind happens to vary, blow le&s;s or more, or the waves run higher or lower, more a-head or a-&s;tern of the &s;hip, and as &s;he has been &s;teered upon a wind, though under the &s;ame &s;ail, and differs greatly from any &s;chool boys rules, that can be propo&s;ed of allowing more or le&s;s lee-way, according to the &s;ail a &s;hip can carry; for it is well known that two &s;hips may be in com|pany with equal &s;ail &s;et, when one, by her con&s;truction and trim, may not make half &s;o much lee-way as the other.</P>

<P>THIS method, defective as it is, mu&s;t be made the mo&s;t off, till a better is brought into practice.</P>
<P>The Learned have, with much &s;eeming rea&s;on, recommended to us to have our log-lines marked 50 feet to a knot, and the gla&s;s to mea&s;ure 30 &s;econds of time, which are exactly 120th part of a geographical mile, and of an hour, and mu&s;t be allowed to agree better with exact calculation than our common practice of having but 42 feet of line, to a gla&s;s of 28 &s;econds of time, which line is four feet eight inches, or about a ninth part &s;hort of the above pro|portions, yet in our practice this is found from long experience to mea&s;ure very well a geographical or &s;ea mile of 60 to a degree, which mile in my opinion &s;hould become general, and be u&s;ed in the &s;cale of all our &s;ea maps, in&s;tead of our Engli&s;h &s;tatute mile, which is about a 7th part le&s;s, by which difference the unlearned may be deceived.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="123">COMMON practice can only be proved to be right, by frequent fair trials, I was mate of a &s;hip in the <HI>Jamaica</HI> trade from <HI>London,</HI> outward bound, and we marked the log-line &s;even fathom to a knot, to a 28 &s;econd gla&s;s as u&s;ual, till we were di&s;appointed of &s;eeing our expected land-fall according to our reckonings; our commander then a&s;ked how we had marked the log-line, he was an&s;wered &s;even fathom to a knot, he then ordered the line imme|diately to be new marked eight fathom to a knot, and &s;aid that the &s;hip was one eighth part &s;hort of her longitude, by the line being marked &s;even fathoms in&s;tead of eight to a knot, and &s;o it proved, for we made the land as he &s;aid. But in our pa&s;&s;age home by this rule, we found the &s;hip a great deal above an eighth part of the longitude a-head of all our reckonings, which nearly proved of fa|tal con&s;equence, as we were carrying all the &s;ail po&s;&s;ible with a we&s;terly gail of wind and hazy weather, when we luckily perceiv|ed by the colour of the water that we mu&s;t be in &s;oundings, and it proved &s;o, and found our&s;elves far up the King's channel in a fair way, and we had e&s;caped a great ri&s;k of running the &s;hip on &s;hore unexpectedly with all &s;ails &s;et. This convinced me that it was not the fault of the log-line being marked &s;even fathom, but another cau&s;e that may be mentioned hereafter, and that is known always to have this effect upon &s;hips in their voyages to and from the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> &s;o as to make more difference of longi|tude out than they do home.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proporti|ons for the line and gla&s;s.</NOTE>THE proportion of &s;even fathom of line, to a gla&s;s of 28 &s;e|conds being right, is confirmed by the general practice in the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> trade, as well as all other trades that I have been in, my opinion is, that it will &s;tand the te&s;t of any fair trial.

that the&s;e proportions for the log an&s;wer very well if proper|ly attended to, and therefore cannot be the cau&s;e which occa&s;ions bad reckonings, and if it is an error, it mu&s;t be allowed to be on the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t &s;ide, that the reckoning &s;hould be rather a-head than a-&s;tern of the &s;hip, to put people upon their guard in proper time, to prevent the fatal con&s;equence that may attend an unexpected land-fall.</P>
<P>THE readie&s;t and &s;ure&s;t way to mark and try the log-line, is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To mark the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne and try the gla&s;s.</NOTE> to have the whole length of the half knot (21 feet) mea&s;ured and marked &s;traight along the deck, and to have the knots put into the line &s;o as they may be ea&s;ily &s;hifted backwards or forwards, as the &s;tretching and &s;hrinking of the line often re|quires. But before this is done, the half minute gla&s;s &s;hould be tried, whether it runs exactly 28 &s;econds, that if it is found to run more or le&s;s, the line &s;hould be marked longer or &s;horter according to the&s;e porportions, as 28 gives 42, what will a &s;e|cond or two more or le&s;s give? and this may be done &s;ufficiently near by the &s;cale and compa&s;s. And the gla&s;&s;es may be tried by a mu&s;ket ball fa&s;tened to a thread held &s;teady in one hand be|tween the finger and thumb exactly 29 inches from the ball, which mu&s;t be &s;wung by the other hand, and continued &s;wing|ing more than thirty times, by which I have found from frequent experience each &s;wing then mea&s;ured a &s;econd of time &s;ufficiently near for this purpo&s;e, even when the &s;hip had &s;ome motion from the waves. But the be&s;t in&s;trument for this purpo&s;e, as well as many other u&s;eful and curious purpo&s;es at &s;ea, is a good watch, or time keeper, that &s;hews &s;econds, which will an&s;wer equally well in a &s;torm when the waves run high, as in &s;mooth water, therefore eve|ry officer that has the charge of navigating a &s;hip, &s;hould have one of the be&s;t he can afford to buy.</P>
<P>IT is a &s;ufficient trial for the quarter minute gla&s;s, if it runs cut exactly twice, for the half minute gla&s;s once. But after all one's care in finding out exact proportions, by which to get the true di&s;|tance run, the whole depends chiefly on tho&s;e who heave the log, and hold the gla&s;s, neither of which &s;hould be done by carele&s;s peo|ple, e&s;pecially when the &s;hip &s;ails &s;o fa&s;t as to require to u&s;e the quarter minute gla&s;s which will double all errors, therefore this gla&s;s &s;hould be as &s;eldom u&s;ed as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE Learned as before mentioned, have very ju&s;tly recommend|ed to have the line that is run out above the knots, &s;et down in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|thoms of 5 feet each, being the tenth part of their 50 feet knots.
<PB N="112" REF="125">
The &s;ame exact rule may be ea&s;ily u&s;ed, only by having a mea&s;ure of four feet, two inches and a half, marked on the rail, on each quar|ter where the log is hove, that will mea&s;ure tenths of a mile from our 42 feet knots, which mu&s;t be allowed will come much nearer the true di&s;tance, and agree much better to the tenths of miles in the tra|ver&s;e tables, than that old and bad practice, of &s;etting down nothing le&s;s than the half knots, or that more exact method of marking down to fathoms of &s;ix feet, and the&s;e tenths of a knot above or un|der the knot or half knot, might be very ea&s;ily mea&s;ured by the officer that heaves the log.</P>
<P>BUT after all the exacte&s;t rules, the mo&s;t effectual method in my opinion to try what dependance can be put upon the log, and tho&s;e that heave it, is that I have before mentioned, if opportunity per|mits, clear of tides or currents, after a good ob&s;ervation had for the latitude, that is, to allow for the variation and &s;teer due north or &s;outh, till a &s;econd ob&s;ervation, if it can be done in a favourable time, which will give the true&s;t real di&s;tance that can be got at Sea to compare with the Log.</P>

this I can &s;ay from experience, that it is not &s;ufficient that a &s;hip can be got before the wind at the time of a heavy &s;quall with a great deal of &s;ail &s;et, which may endanger not only the ma&s;ts and &s;ails, but the &s;hip may be &s;o over pre&s;&s;ed with &s;ail as to put it out of the power of the helm and the be&s;t helm&s;man to &s;teer her from broach|ing to, which may prove fatal to the whole.</P>
<P>WHERE rules cannot be fixed, the re&s;ult of facts from experience mu&s;t be our only guide.

<P>ALL unnece&s;&s;ary dating risks of every kind, when there is no pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion to require &s;uch, &s;hould be avoided and condemned as the greate&s;t folly, for there can be but little lo&s;t, and a great deal may be &s;aved, by lowering or taking in &s;ail in good time, when a &s;hip is &s;ailing large or before the wind in the time of a &s;quall, as &s;ails may be &s;oon and ea&s;ily &s;et again when the &s;quall is over, which may be the means to prevent great lo&s;s or damage.</P>
<P>AMONG many in&s;tances of this kind that I have known I met with one, by the foolhardine&s;s of a London pilot, who would not let our &s;ails be lowered, when &s;ailing before the wind in a &s;quall, which made the ma&s;ts bend &s;o much, that when we wanted to clew down the topgallant &s;ails and top&s;ails, we could not get them down, which &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity there is of clewing the&s;e &s;ails down, and &s;ecuring them down from flying up again before a &s;quall comes on, for had this &s;quall proved any &s;tronger, or continued any longer, we mu&s;t have lo&s;t our ma&s;ts, in &s;pite of our utmo&s;t endeavours.</P>

I had an in&s;tance of this when I was mate of a &s;hip, and it was my watch upon deck, when &s;ailing in this way, at the approach of a dangerous wave coming right upon the beam. I ordered the helm hard a weather, but my commander ordered the helm a-lee, which occa&s;ioned the wave to have the abovementioned bad effect, tho' we received no material damage, yet, in my opi|nion it would have been le&s;s hazardous to have bore away with the helm a-weather.</P>
<P>But to do ju&s;tice on this occa&s;ion, it mu&s;t be allowed that &s;hips in general commonly carry a pre&s;&s;ing &s;ail in this way, and are apt to gripe and carry the helm nearly hard a-weather, to &s;teer the in|tended cour&s;e; &s;o that without this is noticed and guarded again&s;t by the officer of the watch, by having only a &s;uitable &s;ail &s;et, and properly trimmed, it may be out of the power of the helm when hard a-weather, to make the &s;hip ware fa&s;t enough to avoid the bad effects of a dangerous wave when perceived to be coming upon the beam.</P>

<P>To make a good landfall, if the &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of wind and weather permit, that a &s;hip can &s;ail with a leading wind true ea&s;t, or we&s;t, to the place of the de&s;igned landfall, it is an ap|proved method to get into that latitude in good time, and e&s;pecially homeward bound from the We&s;tern ocean, and to endeavour by all po&s;&s;ible means to get ob&s;ervations, to make proper allowance for the variation of the compa&s;s, leeway, bad &s;teerage, currents, or tides, if known, to keep the &s;hip as near as po&s;&s;ible in this de&s;igned latitude. When got into the de&s;igned latitude, the uncertainty of the longitude makes the di&s;tance to be run as uncertain, therefore
<PB N="132" REF="145">
in the day and clear weather, all the &s;ail that is po&s;&s;ible with &s;afety &s;hould be carried, but in the night or thick weather, if it is thought prudent to run, it &s;hould only be with &s;uch &s;ails, as the officer and people on deck can look round them, and work the &s;hip to avoid the danger in whatever manner it may appear.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e rules and precautions in landfalls, I have experienced very narrow e&s;capes, both in America, and on our own coa&s;t, where we are very liable to be deceived by the tides, and in cloudy weather, by taking one place for another. Among ma|ny in&s;tances, it was my ca&s;e in a &s;hip from Leghorn to London, when in a cloudy afternoon we fell in with, and ju&s;t got a glimp&s;e of the &s;outh &s;ide of St. Mary's Scilly i&s;land, which by our reckon|ings, and an account we had from an outer bound &s;hip, we took it for, and concluded it to be the lizard point which we had &s;een. Therefore ordered, as I thought we might with confidence &s;teer, a channel cour&s;e for the night, but our mi&s;taken &s;ituation, tho' in a fair line of direction with our channel cour&s;e, occa&s;ioned the ebb tide that &s;ets N. W. between Scilly and the lands end, to take the &s;hip on the &s;tarboard bow, which &s;heered us in&s;en&s;ibly into the bottom of Mount's Bay: about midnight we were &s;urpri&s;ed with broken water and land extending as far as we could &s;ee on our &s;tarboard bow, when carrying topgallant &s;ails with a fre&s;h gale quartering at S. W. and large &s;welling waves from the main ocean right into the bay.</P>
<P>The hurry we were in to exert our utmo&s;t endeavours at this cri|tical moment may be judged from our dangerous &s;ituation; we had our &s;mall &s;ails to take in, and our top&s;ails to get down, before we could bring the &s;hip by the wind to lay her head from the neare&s;t breakers, and we had the main and foretop&s;ails to clo&s;e roof, and the topgallant yards, &amp;c. to get down, when we had not room to &s;tand above a quarter of an hour upon a tack clear of the breakers. This &s;o alarmed &s;ome Engli&s;h pa&s;&s;engers (and even one of them who had been brought up to &s;ea) that they all a&s;&s;embled in the great cabin to prayers, which they thought was their only refuge for &s;afety; but putting the &s;hip in &s;tays which &s;he refu&s;ed, and then wating her round,<NOTE PLACE="marg">On turn|ing out of Mount's Bay, and our ma|nagement in box hauling.</NOTE> by box hauling, as repre&s;ented in the two figures, plate the 7th, frightened them from prayer, and they all came upon deck thinking we were running the &s;hip on &s;hore. We thus managed her by box hauling, as &s;oon as we perceived the &s;hip cea&s;ed from coming about in &s;tays, we hauled the fore &s;heet
<PB N="133" REF="146">
clo&s;e aft again, trimmed the head-&s;ails flat whil&s;t the &s;ails were &s;haking, and hauled about the main and main top &s;ail the &s;ame as if the &s;hip had &s;tayed, hauled up the mizen and kept the helm hard a lee, as repre&s;ented by figure 2 in the &s;ame plate, by which the &s;hip getting great &s;tern-way turned &s;hort round upon her heel, till &s;he filled the main and main top &s;ails the right way, we then &s;hifted the helm hard a-weather, when the &s;hip got head way with the &s;ails trimm'd, as repre&s;ented by figure 1, which brought her readily round, with little lo&s;s of ground, by the&s;e means in about twelve hours we turned to windward &s;o far off the lee &s;hore, as re|pre&s;ented at figure 3, &s;o as to weather the lizard, where, to pre|vent &s;uch dangers at this place as we narrowly e&s;caped, they have &s;ince erected light hou&s;es, for which they have my thanks, and in my opinion de&s;erve the thanks of the public. The like public thanks will be due to whoever may be in&s;trumental in getting a di|&s;tingui&s;hable light or lights on <HI>Holyhead,</HI> to prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible &s;uch fatal lo&s;&s;es as have often happened in <HI>Carnarvon</HI> bay, occa&s;ioned principally by the ebb tide taking &s;hips on the larboard bow, in St. <HI>George</HI>'s channel, when &s;teering from <HI>Tu&s;ker</HI> for <HI>Holy|head</HI> which &s;heers them in&s;en&s;ibly into <HI>Carnarvon</HI> bay if the tide is not properly allowed for as beforementioned.</P>
<P>THAT a &s;hip &s;ailing again&s;t a tide or current,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nece&s;&s;a|ry cauti|ons in &s;trong tide chan|nels.</NOTE> which takes her on either bow, is the cau&s;e that alters her cour&s;e, mu&s;t be evident to every one who knows that when a &s;hip is &s;ailing with a leading wind in a narrow river or channel again&s;t a &s;trong tide or current, it requires nice &s;teerage right again&s;t the &s;tream to keep her in a fair way, for if the &s;tream is let to take her on the &s;tarboard bow, &s;he will &s;oon &s;heer upon the larboard &s;hore, if on the larboard bow upon the &s;tarboard &s;hore, &amp;c. &s;o that the &s;ame cau&s;e will have the &s;ame effect in all narrow &s;eas, or channels in proportion to their breadth. Where the tide or current runs &s;trong, it may be highly nece&s;&s;ary in the night or thick weather, to endeavour to &s;teer right again&s;t the &s;tream whil&s;t it runs again&s;t the &s;hip, as circum&s;tances may require, to keep the &s;hip in mid channel, or in a fair way till day-light, or until the weather is &s;o clear as to permit to &s;ee the danger at a &s;ufficient di&s;tance to run a-cro&s;s the &s;tream boldly for the land to know the &s;hip's real &s;ituation, which may be a means to avoid &s;uch dangers as abovementioned, and to proceed forward with more &s;afety. Proceeding in this cautious manner, is e&s;peci|ally nece&s;&s;ary in St. <HI>George</HI>'s channel, where the tides run &s;o &s;trong, that when a &s;hip happens to enter it, at the fir&s;t part of either flood

or ebb, if the land cannot be &s;een clear enough to make proper remarks, the tide may make va&s;t alteration in the intended di&s;tance to be run,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not to mi&s;take the land.</NOTE> as well as in the cour&s;e, by which people's judgment is apt to be mi&s;led, and they take one place for another, which has occa&s;ioned great lo&s;s and damage to my knowledge.</P>
<P>THEREFORE after a night's run in St. <HI>George</HI>'s channel, if the land you happen to fall in with appears dubious, to avoid any bad con|&s;equence that may attend a mi&s;take, no pains &s;hould be &s;pared to get a certain knowledge of it; at the clearing up of a fog, I have been obliged to &s;end a boat on &s;hore to enquire what land it was that we found our&s;elves &s;o near to, and which &s;urprized us after|wards to find it was a part of the <HI>I&s;le of Man,</HI> and we &s;hould not have known it without this trouble, &s;uch great alteration does the different &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere &s;ometimes make in the appear|ance of land.</P>
<P>Now let us &s;uppo&s;e a &s;hip arrived &s;afe to where &s;he is obliged to take in a pilot, if he is to be boarded from a &s;loop, &s;chooner, or hoy rigged ve&s;&s;el, under &s;ail at &s;ea, in bad weather it may be dan|gerous, and is often attended with damage, if not properly manag|ed, therefore it de&s;erves notice.</P>

<HEAD>On getting a Pilot on Board in bad Weather at Sea.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is &s;ometimes attended with &s;o much danger, that the Pi|lot &s;loops belonging to <HI>Leverpool,</HI> rather than run the ri&s;k of boarding a &s;hip from their own &s;loop, &s;ometimes go no nearer to the &s;hip than to have a &s;mall rope thrown to or veered a-&s;tern to them, which they make fa&s;t about the pilot's body under his arm|pits, he then goes overboard into the &s;ea when as near the &s;hip as they dare venture, and he is hauled on board the &s;hip by the rope.</P>
<P>IT is a bad and common practice, in many &s;hips, when the pi|lot ve&s;&s;el has got near them, to lay the &s;hip to, with the helm a-lee, and to let her drive with the main or fore-top-&s;ail a-back, thinking they may be boarded by the pilot's ve&s;&s;el without danger. But no &s;en&s;ible pilot, that knows what would be the con&s;equence, will offer to board at &s;uch time, whil&s;t the &s;hip lies to. But if an unexperienced pilot boards a &s;hip upon the weather quarter, which &s;eems much the be&s;t for the purpo&s;e, the &s;hip then heelding to lee|ward,
<PB N="135" REF="148">
keeps the yards, ma&s;ts and rigging clear from getting entan|gled. Yet it is well known from experience, that it is more diffi|cult to board to windward than to leeward, and that a &s;troke by a wave from a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el again&s;t a large one, will do much more damage, than a &s;troke by a large ve&s;&s;el again&s;t a &s;mall one, be|cau&s;e the large ve&s;&s;el re&s;i&s;ts and does not give way to the blow of the &s;mall one, which would yield and give way to a &s;troke from the large one, in proportion to the difference of their weight, for which rea&s;on a &s;hip &s;hould always be boarded on the lee &s;ide, but to do it whil&s;t &s;he lies to is attended with too much danger to ri&s;k, when the &s;hip has any motion from the waves, for the helm being a lee the &s;hip may get &s;ternway, and fall round off from the wind, whil&s;t the pilot's ve&s;&s;el is boarding, which may occa&s;ion great da|mage, and for want of a &s;tern rope I have known rowing boats, when boarding get athwart the hau&s;e and &s;ink at &s;uch times.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t method for this purpo&s;e in my opinion is, when the pilot ve&s;&s;el is got near, but &s;till far enough to windward; for the &s;hip to &s;ail right forward about a point from the wind, with the af|ter-yards braced &s;harp up, the main yard a-back out of the way, and &s;ail enough, e&s;pecially &s;tay &s;ails, to keep good head way up|on the &s;hip, the more the better &s;o that &s;he has only a little le&s;s way than the pilot ve&s;&s;el, which may &s;hoot up under the &s;hip's lee quarter, where a &s;tern rope, and one pa&s;&s;ed aft from forward &s;hould be ready and thrown them, by which they may tow and &s;teer their ve&s;&s;el clear from damage under the lee quarter, &s;heltered by the &s;hip from the waves, and may watch for a &s;mooth &s;ea, and &s;heer to the &s;hip at plea&s;ure to board the pilot, and &s;heer clear again with the lea&s;t ri&s;k po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<HEAD>On PILOTS.</HEAD>
<P>A Pilot's qualifications &s;hould as much as po&s;&s;ible be every way equal to the dangers and difficulties that attend his naviga|tion, and &s;hould know where the &s;hoals extend to a great di&s;tance, and where the channels are narrow, intricate, and &s;hallow, where and when expo&s;ed to dangerous waves, where life as well as pro|perty being at ri&s;k. None &s;hould be admitted to take upon them this important charge, but &s;uch as from experience and practice,
<PB N="136" REF="149">
can give a ready verbal account of the cour&s;e and di&s;tance from one place to another, the flowing and &s;etting of the tides, depth of water, land marks, buoys, beacons, lights, &amp;c. And &s;hould not only be &s;eaman enough to work and manage a &s;hip to the be&s;t advantage in fine weather, but capable when in difficult &s;ituations to form a right judgment what is be&s;t to be done for &s;afety, and what can rea&s;onably be expected for the people and the &s;hip to do on every occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t and mo&s;t dexterous pilots for working and managing &s;hips in crowded, narrow, or dangerous channels are tho&s;e at <HI>Tin|mouth</HI> haven, who from much practice by having many large collier &s;hips to pilot in and out, as mentioned page 93, are more expert than any other people that I have &s;een, and they take remarkable pains to get the &s;hip &s;teered to their mind, they look out &s;harp, and cun the helms-man loud and quick, and make him an&s;wer and move the helm as the occa&s;ion may require, to counteract as much as po&s;&s;ible the motion of the waves that may make the &s;hip devi|ate either way from her intended tract. And when they turn to windward into the harbour, they likewi&s;e ob&s;erve with great atten|tion, and cun quick to keep the &s;hip fairly full and by the wind, with good way upon her, under the command of the helm to make her work the better, and when they come to, where there is not room to turn to windward they take care to lay her head the right way, brail up the cour&s;es and drive to windward with the tide, where they have only little more room than the &s;hip's length.</P>
<P>BUT when or where a pilot is found defective in &s;eaman&s;hip, or capacity to judge and act with &s;kill and prudence, on difficult or dangerous occa&s;ions, it is certainly the duty of the commander and proper officers to be upon their guard, and not to give up their judgment and them&s;elves implicitly to a pilot, of who&s;e conduct they have no a&s;&s;urance, which has to my knowledge occa&s;ioned great damage and fatal lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THEREFORE when a pilot's capacity is not known, his behaviour in management and de&s;ign of proceeding &s;hould be noticed, and treated with more or le&s;s confidence as his conduct &s;eems to de|&s;erve, and when it plainly appears that his conduct cannot be de|pended upon, then &s;elf pre&s;ervation, the fir&s;t law of nature, makes it a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity and point of duty for the commander to in|terfere with the pilot, and tru&s;t to his conduct no farther than is
<PB N="137" REF="150">
con&s;i&s;tent with &s;afety. And not to be afraid of that fal&s;e common notion, that if a commander of a &s;hip interferes in the pilot's duty, he makes him&s;elf an&s;werable for the con&s;equence to the en&s;urers, but it is quite otherwi&s;e, for the en&s;urers en&s;ure the commander's conduct, therefore in&s;tead of being blamed by the en&s;urers, he certainly de&s;erves their thanks for endeavouring to prevent lo&s;s or damage that is likely to be the con&s;equence of a thoughtle&s;s blun|dering pilot that has fallen to his lot, which has been my ca&s;e when we had a very narrow e&s;cape.</P>
<P>BUT pilots, like other ranks of men, mu&s;t be allowed to have dif|ferent capacities and di&s;po&s;itions, and according to their practice mu&s;t be more or le&s;s capable of their duty, con&s;equently among the many there mu&s;t be a variety of good, bad, and indifferent, yet the re&s;pectable character of a pilot on the whole, entitles them to be treated with all the re&s;pect and encouragement their u&s;efulne&s;s de|&s;erves, &s;o that when a pilot proves deficient in his duty, and a bet|ter is not to be had, to make the mo&s;t of him, it is certainly be&s;t to endeavour by all po&s;&s;ible means to help and advi&s;e him with candour what may be thought be&s;t to be done according to circum|&s;tances, and if his &s;pirits appear to fail him in a dangerous pa&s;&s;age or &s;ituation, and no remedy le&s;t but to go forward, he &s;hould then be cheered and encouraged to keep up his heart, and not to let fear nor intoxication with liquor, get the better of him, which may be of equal bad con&s;equence</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t danger is from tho&s;e incon&s;iderate and unexperi|enced pilots, who think a &s;hip may be managed and conducted with equal ea&s;e and &s;afety among &s;hoals, as their own &s;mall ve&s;&s;els to which they have been accu&s;tomed, therefore they think there is no occa&s;ion to wait for the tide, the day-light, or clear weather but to pu&s;h forward at all hazard, though it may be &s;uch weather that no lights, marks, buoys, beacons, nor the dangerous &s;hoals in the way can be &s;een, nor guarded again&s;t by a compa&s;s cour&s;e, nor by the lead, at a &s;ufficient di&s;tance to keep clear of them.</P>
<P>I HAD the experience of a pilot of this &s;ort, who wanted to run in the night among&s;t the &s;hoals, when nothing could be &s;een for a guide to keep clear of them, therefore I oppo&s;ed him till day-light, when it blew fre&s;h right upon the &s;hore, with drizzling hazy wea|ther that we could not &s;ee a mile before us, he pre&s;&s;ed me very hard to bear away and &s;et &s;ail, I rea&s;oned with him of the danger, and would not con&s;ent till we had a con&s;ultation of the officers,
<PB N="138" REF="151">
when he was told of the great ri&s;k there was in running upon a lee &s;hore in &s;uch bad weather, that if we fell in at any great di&s;|tance from a fair way, he was to con&s;ider that the &s;hip was not to be worked and managed in little room among &s;hoals, like the &s;mall ve&s;&s;el we had taken him from, &amp;c. he an&s;wered that the greate&s;t danger was from our not running to get into &s;afety when we might, and that his life was as dear to him, having a family depending upon it, as any of ours could be to us, and that if he could but &s;ee any part of the land, or even the breakers he could &s;teer in by them, to get into &s;afety.</P>
<P>BY the pilot's per&s;ua&s;ion we bore away for our port, but with all the nece&s;&s;ary precaution po&s;&s;ible, to guard again&s;t the appre|hended dangers above-mentioned; we run before the wind under clo&s;e reefed main and foretop &s;ails, thinking we &s;hould be obliged to carry them by the wind, if occa&s;ion required to make the &s;hip work, or to keep clear of the lee &s;hore, the lower &s;ails in the brails ready to &s;et on either tack by the wind, the anchors and cables all clear, all hands at their &s;tations looking &s;harp out, and the deep &s;ea lead going; in 15 fathom water, we &s;aw land and &s;hoal broken water near a-head, which was &s;hewn to the pilot, a&s;king him which way we &s;hould go now, he pointed from the danger we were near|e&s;t to, but looking the way he pointed, nothing could be &s;een but broken raging waves, we a&s;ked him what was then to be done, being in five fathom water, I perceived he was overcome with fear, and had nothing to &s;ay, but left us to &s;ave our&s;elves as we could; we then brought the &s;hip round to by the wind, and notwith&s;tand|ing we were well mann'd, was obliged to get the main and fore &s;heets aft with the tacks, not above two thirds down, by which, under Providence, and the &s;hip's fa&s;t &s;ailing, we but ju&s;t cleared the breakers on the lee-&s;hore, which would by all appearance have proved our total de&s;truction, if the &s;hip had been left to the conduct of the pilot, who after this, as it is common with all &s;uch unthinking men, went from a ra&s;h confidence to &s;uch extreme fearfulne&s;s, that he thought we could not po&s;&s;ibly get far enough from the danger we had &s;o narrowly e&s;caped; when the weather cleared up with a &s;ud|den change, and a gail of wind right off &s;hore, that put us under reef|ed cour&s;es, we could but ju&s;t &s;ee the land from the ma&s;t head.</P>
<P>THIS pilot's conduct, and the many in&s;tances of damage, and fa|tal lo&s;&s;es, that have been occa&s;ioned by ra&s;h, imprudent, and de|fective pilots, prove the nece&s;&s;ity that a commander may be often
<PB N="139" REF="152">
under to interfere with the pilot, but it &s;hould always be done in a calm friendly manner to advi&s;e or a&s;&s;i&s;t him in whatever he may &s;eem deficient, for it is but natural to &s;uppo&s;e that a commander &s;hould know the trim and properties of his &s;hip from experience, and what dependence may be put on her for &s;ailing, &s;teering, &s;tay|ing, waring, or to ride at an anchor, and how they can work and manage her on extraordinary occa&s;ions, in narrow and dangerous channels, and &s;hould form a better judgment what the &s;hip and crew can do, than a &s;trange pilot who may be a brave man, and know his way very well, yet, for want of experience, may be much inferior to the commander in working and managing the &s;hip, and when this is the ca&s;e, it &s;hould be agreed for the pilot to &s;hew the way and point out the dangers, whil&s;t the commander works and manages the &s;hip to keep clear of them, which in my opinion may often contribute greatly to prevent misfortunes. But when pilots are known to be thoroughly qualified to work and manage a &s;hip as their navigation requires, then the commander has only to &s;ee that the pilot's orders are obeyed.</P>
<P>BUT when &s;hips are going for &s;hoal flats, bar or tide harbour, where &s;afety depends upon the height and time of tide which makes all hints or remarks from ob&s;ervations on the tides de&s;erve notice, therefore, &s;ailor like, I venture to give &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon them.</P>

<P>THE tides, and the knowledge of them, are of &s;uch great and important advantages to our navigation, and e&s;pecially among our many &s;hoals, flatts, bar and tide harbours, where it de|pends entirely upon the certainty of the flow and time of the tide to proceed with &s;afety.

occa&s;ioned by &s;hips running for our &s;hoal water harbours at a wrong time of tide, being deceived by the old common method of reckon|ing the tides, which is very erroneous, e&s;pecially at the quarters of the moon, and marking the time of flowing at full and change al|ways to a point of the compa&s;s, adds to the uncertainty of a &s;hip from &s;ea to find the time of high water, which from experience I can &s;ay has occa&s;ioned great lo&s;s and damage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Damage done by running at a wrong time of tide.</NOTE> I was in a We&s;t In|dia &s;hip running for a bar harbour in <HI>Ireland</HI> by this erroneous rule, when we beat off our gripe, rudder, and a great deal of the &s;tern po&s;t, and after part of the keel upon the bar, and had &s;even feet water in the hold when we got into the harbour, and was obliged to run on &s;hore to prevent &s;inking.

And when this happens at equal night &s;pring tides, we have about twenty-two feet at the gates, and the neap tides low in pro|portion if the moon happens to be in her apogee.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<P>A 'Perfect theory of the tides, and an accurate method of cal|culating them, has been greatly wanted in every age &s;ince navigation was fir&s;t practi&s;ed; and, though indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought af|ter, has hitherto baffled the re&s;earches of the mo&s;t learned. And as their theory has hitherto remained defective, &s;o their methods of calculation, founded thereupon, have &s;ucceeded no better; for, (as I am now furni&s;hed with about three thou&s;and ob&s;ervations made upon the tides at <HI>Liverpool,</HI> and three hundred and &s;ixty at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> with which I can compare my own, and all other methods of calculation) I think I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that all the methods given us in books of navigation, and all the tide tables in&s;erted in
<PB N="144" REF="157">
our almanacks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preface to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le.</NOTE> are very frequently &s;ubject to the error of an hour, and many times of much more; except that of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Caille,</HI> which yet is often liable to an error of forty minutes, as any per|&s;on will find who takes the trouble of making a &s;ufficient number of ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>INDEED no per&s;on can expect that it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, who con&s;iders that <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Caille</HI>'s, and all other Methods (except that of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Ca&s;&s;ini,</HI> which in truth is no better depend entire|ly upon the moon's age, or her di&s;tance from the &s;un; without re|garding the different di&s;tances of either the &s;un or moon from the earth, their declinations, the latitudes of places, or any thing el&s;e that affects the tides.</P>
<P>THUS deficient are all former methods in computing only the times of high water; as for the heights, the calculation thereof has never before been attempted by any one, that I know of; though they are, as I apprehend, equally nece&s;&s;ary; for of what advan|tage can it be to the &s;eaman, to know when the tide will be at the highe&s;t, if there will not be, at that time, depth of water &s;uffici|ent for his purpo&s;e? Indeed it would be of no more &s;ervice to know that there would be depth enough of water, unle&s;s he knew at the &s;ame time, when to expect it. But to know what height the tide will ri&s;e to, and at what time, mu&s;t contribute greatly to his &s;ecurity: and is it not ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, that a tide table &s;hould inform him of both the&s;e?</P>
<P>IF any per&s;on &s;hall think proper to compare this table with his own ob&s;ervations, he ought always to &s;et his watch right immedi|ately before, by &s;ome good &s;un&punc; dial; for the&s;e calculations are made according to &s;olar time.</P>
<P>AND if the watch be thus truly regulated, I doubt not but that they will be &s;ound to corre&s;pond very nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly with the ob&s;ervati|on, as this table is compo&s;ed with the &s;ame care and exactne&s;s as the la&s;t, I having had the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. <HI>Bryan Waller</HI> through the whole work.</P>
<P>INDEED it cannot rationally be expected that any method of com|putation can perfectly agree with the tides, becau&s;e they are &s;ub|ject to various alterations from the wind. Yet notwith&s;tanding all the irregularities cau&s;ed thereby, the heights given in the la&s;t tide table, have agreed with the ob&s;ervations (upon an average) within &s;even inches; and the times within five minutes.'</P>

<P><PB N="145" REF="158">NOTWITHSTANDING gales of wind affect the tides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advan|tages of the&s;e tide tables.</NOTE> I ob&s;erve it is more in the height than in the time, that they are made to dif|fer from the&s;e tide tables, and then an allowance may be judged according to the &s;trength or velocity of the wind blowing for or again&s;t the cour&s;e of the flood tide, which here comes from the &s;outh we&s;t quarter, which to &s;uppo&s;e may increa&s;e the height of the tide above this theory, at the rate of about an inch for every mile of the wind's velocity, above a fre&s;h breeze of about ten miles an hour; and decrea&s;es the height in proportion as the wind blows from the North Ea&s;t quarter.</P>
<P>SO that the&s;e tide tables mu&s;t certainly be of great utility to all that are concerned in the time and height of the tides flowing, and from their height may judge of their velocity, which I reckon op|po&s;ite to the town is at the rate of about a mile an hour for every fathom it flows up and down, and that is about two and a half at common neap, and about four and a half at common &s;pring tides; and there is &s;even feet more water on the bar of the common chan|nel, than at the old dock gates, &s;o that by the tide table, it may be judged when a &s;hip will have water enough to get into the river, and into the docks with &s;afety. And how to birth them according to their drafts of water not only in the wet docks, but in the graving or repairing docks, which are of different depths, that they may have water enough to get out as well as in. And they are thought to be of that importance to our pilots, that the laws for re|gulating the pilots make it a penalty of five pounds for a pilot be|ing without a tide table, and a watch kept to &s;olar time.</P>
<P>THEREFORE I hope the&s;e tide tables will meet with all the en|couragement that the ingenuity and labour de&s;erves to continue their publication,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The moon's di&s;tance to be at|tended to for the height and &s;trength of the tides.</NOTE> till time gives them a fair trial how near their theory agrees, with other &s;hoal dangerous ports or places, that depends upon knowing the certainty of the time, and height of the tides flowing to proceed with &s;afety, which may be a means to recommend &s;uch tide tables to be tried and u&s;ed in proportion to the advantages that may be experienced from them. But till time brings this about, the only method to judge when the tides will be higher or lower than common is to attend to the moon's di&s;tance, being near her perigee or apogee as before-mentioned) which are remarked in the nautical or <HI>White</HI>'s almanacks, and &s;hould be in all our navigation books, where the flowing of the tides are re|marked; and to make an allowance, as a &s;torm of wind happens
<PB N="146" REF="159">
to blow near or again&s;t the direction of the flood tide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To make allowance for the wind be|ing for or again&s;t the flood tide.</NOTE> which I have ob&s;erved to make an alteration of about three feet in the height of the tides, when I judged the wind blowing at the rate of about forty-five miles an hour. I cannot perceive, as has been imagined, that the tides are affected when our neighbouring worlds are pa&s;&s;ing near us in the &s;ame &s;ide of our orbits, as mentioned in page 88, or by the different weight of our atmo&s;phere, as &s;hewn by the barometer. And as I live fronting and but fourteen yards from the dock gates abovementioned, which opens with the flood and &s;huts at high water, whil&s;t I am able and willing would be glad of any directions, rules, or hints, that might improve ob&s;ervations on the tides, to make them more u&s;eful to &s;eamen, pilots, mathe|maticians, a&s;tronomers, or philo&s;ophers.</P>

<P>THESE reflectors are made as near as they can be to the parabo|lic curve by drawing a &s;et of parallel lines right acro&s;s the focus or center line; and mark the focal di&s;tance above the parallel lines, and take an extent from the focal di&s;tance, to each parallel line one after the other, with the&s;e extents mark each parallel line in its turn from the focus or burning point with dots on each &s;ide of the focus line, to the extent of the de&s;igned diameter, and making a regular &s;weep from dot to dot, as repre&s;ented in plate 10, fig. 3, by which method a form may be made, for the curve of a parabolic reflector of any focus or diameter, to have the pro|perty, when the &s;un's, or any other rays of light or fire comes up|on them in parallel lines they are reflected to, and cro&s;s each other at the focus, which makes the focus the burning point; and ju&s;t the contrary effect, when a burning blaze of fire or light is fixed in their focus all the rays of light that falls upon them are reflected right forward in parallel lines, with more or le&s;s power in propor|tion to the lu&s;tre or brightne&s;s of the reflectors, which are illumi|nated &s;o as to look like a blaze as big as the reflectors them&s;elves, to people in that quarter nearly facing them by the angle of reflec|tion being equal to the angle of incident.</P>
<P>WE have made and had in u&s;e here at <HI>Liverpool,</HI> reflectors of one, two, and three feet focus, and three, five and a half, &s;even
<PB N="151" REF="164">
and a half, and twelve feet diameter, the three &s;malle&s;t made of tin plates &s;odered together, and the large&s;t of wood, covered with plates of looking gla&s;s, &s;haped as repre&s;ented by fig. one and two, plate 10, and fixed as near as can be to the above-mentioned rules, and a copper lamp, the ci&s;tern part for the oil and wick &s;tands behind the reflectors, &s;o that nothing &s;tands before the re|flector to intercept the blaze from acting upon it, but the tube that goes through it, with a &s;preading burning mouth-piece, to &s;pread the blaze of the lamp parallel to, and with the middle of it, ju&s;t in the focus or burning point of the reflector, as may be &s;een by the figures above-mentioned.</P>
<P>WE have a feeding can with oil to &s;tand upon the ci&s;tern of each lamp, with a &s;mall bra&s;s cock that is turned to drop or run a little according to the con&s;umption of oil, that it may be kept near to the level of the mouth of the lamp, near which is a little rim to prevent any drains of oil along the tube to the reflector (as may be &s;een in fig. 2.) which drops from the rim, to a dripping-pan that &s;tands below the reflector, and if the cock of the feeding can &s;hould be turned to run too fa&s;t, to prevent an over-flow of oil there is a &s;mall hole and a tube in the ci&s;tern that lets the oil in|to a tin can &s;tanding below it. The lamps like the reflectors are proportional in their bigne&s;s to make a greater or le&s;s blaze as their di&s;tance to be &s;een requires, their &s;preading burning parts are from three to twelve, and fourteen inches, which makes the blaze the &s;ame breadth, and burns higher or lower, according to the quality of the oil, on which the goodne&s;s of the lights greatly depends. And as the wick is common cotton thread, &s;pun for the purpo&s;e of lamps, and wound in lengths to fill the mouth of the lamps about a quarter of an inch thick, and as it con&s;umes there is long mouth pincers, the lengths as above, to haul out the wick altogether through the tubes, as the occa&s;ion requires, and are &s;nuffed with a pair of &s;heers in one hand, and a tin box with a little water in it in the other, for the &s;nuffings, to prevent the danger of fire, and is only required to be attended and trimm'd by their keepers eve|ry four hours.</P>

<PB N="152" REF="165">
the&s;e are allowed to be by all that have &s;een them, for in a dark clear night the two &s;ea lights (notwith&s;tanding their height, and the curvature or roundne&s;s of the &s;ea, as before mentioned) may be plainly &s;een when they are in a line with the horizon, not only from the deck, but from the ma&s;t head of a &s;hip, which gives the advantage to &s;ee which way they are open, to bring them in a line in good time, either to keep the &s;hip off, or run in by them in a fair way, as the circum&s;tance of the time and tide prudently con&s;idered may require.</P>
<P>BUT it may be &s;aid that the&s;e reflecting lights only &s;uit &s;uch places as require them to be &s;een only from one quarter of the compa&s;s, which mu&s;t be acknowledged, though two of our lamps give a blaze twelve and fourteen inches &s;quare, yet there is but lit|tle reflected light above three points of the compa&s;s each way, but then it mu&s;t be allowed that the blaze of the lamps can be &s;een as in common with other lights above half the compa&s;s clear of the edge of the reflectors, which illuminate greatly the atmo&s;phere fronting them, that adds greatly to the light even in that &s;ituation.</P>

<P>BUT where a light-hou&s;e requires to be &s;een equally from all quarters quite round the compa&s;s, and lighted with a number of candles, or common lamps, as it is known from experience, that their rays of light pa&s;s and cro&s;s each other freely in all directions, without any vi&s;ible interruption, which makes it a di&s;puted point, whether reflectors would be of any &s;ervice; which in my opinion a number of tho&s;e hand lamps with their reflectors &s;et round upon &s;helves near the windows as above-mentioned, would reflect ma|ny rays of light in an horizontal direction clear of the &s;moke, that would fall above and below the windows, and throw more light
<PB N="153" REF="166">
through the windows, with, than without the reflectors, from an equal quantity of lights, but the advantage that would be gained wants to be confirmed by experiment.</P>
<P>THESE hand lamps and reflectors were contrived to make night &s;ignals by lights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Signals for &s;hips &s;een off, and in di|&s;tre&s;s.</NOTE> to be &s;et in the &s;tair ca&s;e windows of our upper &s;ea light-hou&s;e, that fronts towards the town, in ca&s;e of any ve&s;|&s;el being perceived in di&s;tre&s;s in the night, or when it is too dark to &s;ee the day &s;ignals, which are repre&s;ented with the light-hou&s;e, fig. 6, plate 10, as they were publi&s;hed upon a chard to make them known; and as they have given general &s;atisfaction &s;ince they have been in u&s;e, and afford a greater number and variety of different ve&s;&s;els than any other &s;et of &s;ignals I have &s;een I thought de&s;erved this notice. Be&s;ides the&s;e public &s;ignals, &s;everal mer|chants have flag-&s;taffs erected at a little di&s;tance from the light-hou&s;e, that when their &s;hips appear with their particular &s;ignal their colours are hoi&s;ted on their flag&s;taff for their information.</P>
<P>IT is further propo&s;ed to have at this light-hou&s;e, a &s;et of gun chambers charged with a compo&s;ition of fire balls next the pow|der, then filled with &s;aw-du&s;t, and a &s;ur plug drove hard in with a wooden mall, that when any ve&s;&s;el is perceived to make &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s for help, either by day or night, they are to be an&s;wer|ed by firing one of the&s;e chambers, which &s;tands with its breech upon the ground, that prevents any recoil, therefore di&s;charges its contents right up in the air with a loud explo&s;ion, which will not only alarm the town to &s;end help, but the fire ball &s;parkling in the air will give the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed a great &s;atisfaction to &s;ee that their &s;ignals are noticed to expect help. The &s;ituation of this light-hou&s;e is well adapted to an&s;wer all the&s;e purpo&s;es, &s;tanding fronting the town and docks at three miles di&s;tance upon a &s;tone hill about for|ty yards high above the level of the &s;ea at high water, which makes it very con&s;picuous, both from the town and at &s;ea, it being the fir&s;t object that appears on &s;hore above the horizon, in a fair direc|tion for its channel as may be &s;een by the chart.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the hand lamps and reflectors, as before-men|tioned, I tried one of them with our reflectors of three feet diame|ter, and one foot focus, made and gla&s;&s;ed as repre&s;ented in fig 1, 2, but it proved greatly inferior, though it might be &s;een at nine or ten miles di&s;tance, and in trying them with a common &s;hop lamp with equal wicks, and &s;et in different windows of the &s;tair ca&s;e of the light-hou&s;e that faces the town as above-mentioned, when the
<PB N="154" REF="167">
reflected lamp eclip&s;ed the common lamp to &s;uch a degree that I could not &s;ee it without u&s;ing a &s;py gla&s;s at three miles di|&s;tance, and the&s;e &s;mall reflectors being only beat out of common tin, that if they were improved and made of blown quick-&s;ilvered gla&s;s, &s;ilver plated copper, or reflecting tele&s;cope metal as con|cave mirrors, and &s;odered all together with the lamp in a tin pan like a dripping pan, as repre&s;ented in fig. 4 and 5, only with the addition of tin &s;tays behind the reflectors to keep altogether in handling them about, it is a doubt with me, whether a number &s;et as before mentioned, would not be preferable to our large reflec|tors, for I have perceived from experience, that our large reflectors of one foot focus, and three feet diameter, reflects a &s;tronger light in proportion than our large reflector of twelve feet diameter and three feet focus.</P>
<P>ANOTHER great benefit I thought might ari&s;e from the&s;e hand re|flectors if they were brought to perfection, &s;ingle light hou&s;es might be di&s;tingui&s;hed from one another by having different numbers of windows luminated by them, but in trying experiments with two of them, &s;et in the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;tair-ca&s;e windows of the light-hou&s;e already mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Experi|ment of the di&s;|tance of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s not to appear as one.</NOTE> fig. 6, they appeared at three miles di&s;|tance only as one light, though they were above ten feet a&s;under, and required to be &s;et in the fir&s;t and third windows, which is above nineteen feet a&s;under to appear as two di&s;tinct lights at three miles di&s;tance, which &s;hews how much the&s;e imperfect hand reflectors, illuminated the atmo&s;phere, and how nece&s;&s;ary are experiments be|fore new de&s;igns of this kind are put in execution.</P>
<P>IN light-hou&s;es, where reflectors are de&s;igned to be u&s;ed, and the lights require to be &s;een at the greate&s;t di&s;tance po&s;&s;ible, accord|ing to their high or low &s;ituation above the level of the &s;ea, the re|flectors &s;hould be made to &s;tand with their axes or centre pointing to the horizon; but where they are only required to be &s;een at a &s;mall di&s;tance to lead over a bar, or through a channel near them, then the reflectors &s;hould be pointed to the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary or mo&s;t dangerous place, by which means the mo&s;t rays of light are reflect|ed to where they are mo&s;t wanted. And from experience we find, that plate ground gla&s;s an&s;wers much be&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Round and win|dow, with the be&s;t gla&s;s recom+mended.</NOTE> both for reflectors, and the light room windows, and the larger the panes, and the le&s;s wood in the window frames to ob&s;truct the light, the better, and the windows that are framed round or circular, as well as the light-hou&s;es, &s;tand and re&s;i&s;t the wind much better than tho&s;e that are
<PB N="155" REF="168">
made flat by the octagon or eight &s;ided form. And to keep the light rooms as clear of &s;moke as po&s;&s;ible, I would recommend a large opening in the centre of the roof with a nice cover, and a large vane to make it traver&s;e freely with the wind, and to with-hold whatever contrivance, or the be&s;t materials that can make them the mo&s;t perfect, as far as the fund which is to &s;upport them will af|ford, &s;hould be looked upon as an act of great villainy for the rea|&s;ons given.</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE makes another remark here nece&s;&s;ary, that with|out there is a &s;mall vacuity made in the walls of light-hou&s;es for the wet to drain down, it will beat thro' and rot the wood work.</P>

Therefore from the experience of two wars, I &s;hall en|deavour to point out what I think may be of &s;ome &s;ervice in the fir&s;t of a war, to fit them the better to attack an enemy, or being attacked to defend them&s;elves in the cour&s;e of a voyage, or on a crui&s;e again&s;t the enemy.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t own this is a ta&s;k much more fit for tho&s;e gentlemen that have had the experience of the late brave actions, and improv|ed di&s;cipline of our incomparable Royal Navy. And as I never had that advantage, I hope my defects will be thought the more excu&s;able.</P>

<HEAD>On Fitting out Letter of Mart Ships and Privateers.</HEAD>
<P>SAFETY, as well as &s;ucce&s;s, in my opinion, depends greatly on the manner the&s;e &s;hips are fitted out. Trading &s;hips de&s;igned more for defence than offence, I would recommend to be made to look as big, powerful, and warlike as po&s;&s;ible in order to intimi|date; but privateers the contrary, to look as little and defencele&s;s, and conceal their power as much as po&s;&s;ible, till there is a real oc|ca&s;ion for it, then as &s;uddenly as po&s;&s;ible to make it known, as the occa&s;ion may require to give the greater &s;urpri&s;e, which I can &s;ay from experience may often give great advantages.</P>
<P>AS to the &s;ize and number of great guns, the dimen&s;ions, &s;trength, and properties of the &s;hip, as mentioned in pages 25, 26, 27, &amp;c. &s;hould point out what &s;he will be able to bear without being too crank for a &s;ailing and a fighting &s;hip, though it mu&s;t be allowed that the advantages in a &s;ea fight are greatly in favour of the hea|vie&s;t &s;hot, but the many &s;torms a &s;hip may have to contend with, in a winter's pa&s;&s;age, or crui&s;e in a turbulent ocean, where the great guns may be often rendered a u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous in|cumbrance, by the waves running &s;o high, that nothing but &s;mall arms can be u&s;ed again&s;t the enemy, for which rea&s;ons a &s;hip &s;hould not be over-crowded, or over-burdened with too heavy cannon.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Short and light guns recom|mended.</NOTE>OUR late improvement, in the metal, ca&s;ting, and boring of iron cannon, makes me recommend that they may be made &s;hort, and as light of metal as po&s;&s;ible to bear a &s;ufficient proof, which not only gives proportional &s;afety and ea&s;e to a &s;hip, in the times above-mentioned, but are managed and fought with greater &s;afety, ea&s;e, and expedition, and will do &s;ufficient execution at the &s;mall di&s;tance; the bravery of our people makes it nece&s;&s;ary to fight our &s;hips to the greate&s;t advantage. And in&s;tead of mounting them on the com|mon gun carriage, I take the liberty to recommend what I call the &s;wivel carriage, not only as a great advantage to the &s;hip in carry|ing them with more &s;afety and ea&s;e all weathers, but likewi&s;e to the people in exerci&s;ing or fighting them, which I &s;hall endeavour to prove from rea&s;on as well as experience.</P>

<P>GREAT guns, mounted on the&s;e carriages to be ready at &s;ea in time of war, are commonly carried either run out of the ports, or kept hou&s;ed with their muzzles again&s;t the &s;hip's &s;ide at the upper parts of the ports, as repre&s;ented by one in letter D, plate 9, but is much more ma&s;terly delineated in <HI>Falconer</HI>'s famous Marine Dictionary (which came out a good while after my plates were &s;truck off) in his 7th plate the guns are repre&s;ented, both run out, and &s;towed as la&s;t mentioned, fig. 19, with the muzzle again&s;t the &s;ide of the &s;hip above the port, and he very judiciou&s;ly remarks, at the &s;ecuring the guns, to hook the takles &s;o that a &s;econd breeching may be added, la&s;hed and bow&s;ed as tight as po&s;&s;ible, to prevent the guns from breaking loo&s;e, which may be productive of dangerous con&s;equences: and this by report has &s;o often happened in our Royal Navy, that it was conjectured, that the Victory, a fir&s;t rate &s;hip of war, was lo&s;t by it.

<HEAD>On the Method of carrying Lower Deck Guns.</HEAD>
<P>I OWN on this occa&s;ion to &s;peak principally from the experience of only one &s;hip that had only been three voyages to the Ea&s;t Indies, when &s;he was fitted out fir&s;t to crui&s;e three months off the We&s;tern I&s;lands, we carried thirty-two guns, and eight of them 12 pounders on the lower deck, hou&s;ed as la&s;t mentioned, with their muzzles again&s;t the &s;hip's &s;ide above the ports, which, when the waves ran high, did &s;o work the &s;hip, and the &s;hip them with all their tackle about them, to &s;uch dangerous degrees, that for the &s;afety of the whole, we were obliged at different times to put the&s;e guns down the hold, and leave our &s;tations, to run for &s;afety to a port to get our leaks &s;topped.</P>

<P>COMPARATIVE difference can only be known by fair trials in practice. In the above-mentioned &s;hip <HI>Liverpool,</HI> our &s;pare carriages were of the common &s;ort, when we were going to exer|ci&s;e our great guns, I ordered, and had one of them near the mid|&s;hip's, mounted on a common carriage, and had it exerci&s;ed with the &s;ame men, along with the other guns as they had done before, and gave the word of command proportionally &s;low as this gun re|quired, till the people had got expert in working it, then had an empty ca&s;k put out for the guns to be pointed at, and ordered to go through all the motions of charging and &s;tring as fa&s;t as they could, and ob&s;erved the difference of time between this gun on the common carriage, and the other next it on the &s;wivel carriage, at which the people performed regularly all the motions five times, for tho&s;e with the common carriage thrice, which mu&s;t be allowed to be a great difference, and the&s;e five men quartered at this g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n were &s;o tired with their hard labour, in proportion to tho&s;e five at
<PB N="166" REF="179">
the other guns, which beat them &s;o much, that they begged to have their gun mounted on their &s;wivel carriage again, which I con&s;ented to, being &s;ufficiently convinced of this difference of five times to three with le&s;s labour and fatigue.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">On point|ing the gun to the object.</NOTE>IN action they have likewi&s;e not only the advantage of being fir|ed &s;o much oftener, but pointed with more ea&s;e and certainty to do execution by the captain of the gun only, &s;wivelling and breeching it about by hand, and makes the &s;ignal to fire, when it points directly to the enemy, independent of the other people; which the common carriage requires to be done by the other men with their gun hand-&s;pikes to breech about the gun as their captain looks along it, and makes motions, by tapping on each &s;ide of the breech with his hands, as his orders cannot be heard, makes it very uncertain to got the gun pointed right to his mind, for the people are liable to breech the gun too far each way, or not far enough, that tires his patience, e&s;pecially when he hears other guns fired &s;o long before his, may be aggravated contrary to his inclination, to make the &s;ig|nal, and fire the gun wide of the enemy, rather than be thought &s;o much tardier than the other people, who may only, to &s;hew them&s;elves bri&s;k, be induced to fire at random, if not &s;trictly at|tended to by their officers, and it cannot be expected that they can attend every gun. And when the &s;ituation of the enemy requires the guns pointed as much forward or aft as the ports will allow, as repre&s;ented by the two guns on the different carriages, figure C, plate 9, it may be perceived that the &s;ole of the &s;wivel carriage &s;tands in a direction right in and out, that when the gun is fired it recoils right back oppo&s;ite to the port, ready and ea&s;ily run <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut again after charged, when that on the common carriage recoils back in the &s;ame direction, that the gun points a great way from the port, that makes it trouble&s;ome to get it to the port again, and e&s;pe|cially if they happen to be the lee guns, and the &s;hip heels. The difference for the people's &s;afety in the time of charging the guns likewi&s;e de&s;erves notice, as may be perceived by the po&s;ition of the two guns, &s;ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> D, as abovementioned, that on the &s;wivel carri|age is &s;wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bout, &s;o that the people at the muzzle and breech &s;tand &s;heltered from the &s;mall &s;hot that may be fired in at the port, when tho&s;e at the common carriage are expo&s;ed to it.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="180">BUT it mu&s;t be acknowledged that the&s;e &s;wivel carriages require a little extraordinary trouble to keep the upper part of the &s;oles clean, and grea&s;ed a little at times, to make the guns &s;wivel ea&s;y upon them. And as it is common to hear objections again&s;t new things, the only one I heard again&s;t the&s;e, that they would not &s;tand a long and conte&s;ted fight, which I own we had not the trial of, having learned from experience, that to make the conte&s;t &s;hort in our favour, was to get &s;o near the enemy that our people could not well mi&s;s their object. And as the takles and breechings are all upon the carriage part, I could not perceive, from all my expe|rience, that they would not bear as long firing as the common car|riage, for the centre bolt, &amp;c. has nothing to move but the weight of the &s;ole. After this I was induced to think this carriage wor|thy the notice of the managers of our Royal Navy, therefore I got a nice model with a gilt gun, &amp;c. made, and a friend to pre&s;ent it to Lord <HI>An&s;on,</HI> then at the head of the admiral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and was ready to give a report of it, but my well meant endeavours were di&s;re|garded, for I never heard or &s;aw any thing further of my gun and carriage afterwards.</P>
<P>IF time, after trials, &s;hould bring the&s;e &s;wivel carriages into prac|tice, I would recommend what I thought would be a further im|provement to enable the captain of the gun to point it to the object with &s;till more ea&s;e, by having a hole bored tapering in the centre of the ca&s;cabel of each gun, and to have light round handy crows made to fit the holes, which, in my opinion, would give power to a &s;ingle man to point the gun in any direction from its highe&s;t elevation to its lowe&s;t depre&s;&s;ion, and without injuring the ca&s;cable from an&s;wering all its nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT in either &s;ort of carriages care &s;hould be taken, that they are of a proper height, for the ports, for I have often &s;een guns mounted &s;o low, that when the breech was rai&s;ed they could not recoil clear of the cill of the ports, which is a great fault.</P>

<P>WHATEVER may contribute to &s;helter and &s;ave the people mu&s;t be allowed to de&s;erve notice. Various methods and things have been tried for this purpo&s;e.

<P>HOWEVER this fence or brea&s;t-work may be made to &s;helter the people from &s;mall &s;hot, in common they are no more than brea&s;t high, &s;o that the mu&s;keteers can fire fairly over it upon the enemy, but from experience in fighting, I have ob&s;erved among new fight|ing men there will always be &s;ome of them apt to &s;hew that natural in&s;tinct of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and in order to keep their heads under &s;helter of the brea&s;t work from the enemies &s;hot, fire their mu&s;kets at random up in the air.

<P>THEREFORE to remedy this defect which I perceived in fighting the &s;mall arms, in fitting out a privateer afterwards we had a rail, as in common, brea&s;t high on each &s;ide the quarter deck, and on the rails were fixed light iron crutches with the arms about a foot &s;quare, and a &s;houlder to keep the bottom of the crutches about &s;ix inches above the rails, and thin boards about &s;ix inches broad laid upon the bottom of the crutches, and netting with large &s;quare matches were &s;o med ju&s;t to hold a hammoc with its bedding long-ways, and from the gunnel to the rail was boarded up on each &s;ide of the &s;tantions, and filled up with rope &s;hakens, cork &s;havens, &amp;c. which is found &s;ufficient proof again&s;t mu&s;ket ball; which made &s;o ready and good a fence for the quarter deck mu&s;keteers, that

for I have experienced &s;ome that looked very fine and good made for the u&s;e or rather &s;hameful abu&s;e of the African trade, that in&s;tead of firing &s;hot with &s;ufficient velocity, it would hardly fire it&s;elf, but &s;pent it&s;elf in phizzing one phiz after another out at the touch-hole, and taken up &s;o much time in burning, that it could not be u&s;ed as priming for great guns.</P>
<P>THIS ba&s;e practice of making &s;o very weak powder &s;hould by &s;ome means be put a &s;top to, becau&s;e it not only hurts the mer|chant adventurer, but the intention of government in giving &s;o large a bounty on exportation for the encouragement of the trade of mak|ing good gun-powder. Therefore it &s;hould be either under the in&s;pection of proper e&s;&s;ay ma&s;ters, or bring into practice proper methods to try its &s;trength; and I can &s;ay from experience, that the common &s;mall pi&s;tol powder provers that drives a circular gra|duated plate round, does not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, for they will dif|fer greatly with the &s;ame powder.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To prove the pow|der.</NOTE>THEREFORE I would recommend for this purpo&s;e of trying pow|der, to have a gun of a half pound &s;hot, fixed in a convenient place, mounted firm on a wood block or bed, elevated exactly at 45 degrees, and the powder to be tried by an ounce charge how far it will throw the half pound &s;hot without any wad, and in pro|portion for every foot or yard's di&s;tance under or over a &s;tandard di&s;tance that might be fixed by government's powder, to a&s;certain its &s;trength and value under or over proof, according to the differ|ent trade or purpo&s;e it is de&s;igned for, as well as for privateers or letter of mart &s;hips, which &s;hould be of equal goodne&s;s with that for the Royal navy.</P>
<P>ON &s;hot, the fir&s;t and principal, both for quantity and quality, is the round iron cannon ball, becau&s;e it will go and penetrate farther with a greater velocity than any other to do execution, when engag|ing with a &s;uperior force, but when come to a clo&s;e fight with a &s;hip of inferior force, expecting to make her a prize, then the en|deavours &s;hould be not to de&s;troy the &s;hip if it can po&s;&s;ibly be avoided, but to di&s;tre&s;s them to make a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, therefore &s;ome &s;uitable &s;hot that will an&s;wer that purpo&s;e be&s;t &s;hould be provided.

<P>THE great difference this makes in a &s;hip &s;teering, working, and &s;ailing, makes it a matter of &s;uch importance, that all po&s;&s;ible means &s;hould be u&s;ed to prevent the &s;hip's bottom from growing foul, and the be&s;t method that I have experienced for this purpo&s;e is to be provided with what I call a cask &s;crubber, as repre&s;ented in plate 9, fig. A, which I have often u&s;ed in different &s;hips with &s;ucce&s;s when at an anchor, and in calm weather on the open ocean. I had the&s;e &s;crubbers made of elm board about an inch thick and twelve broad, the middle part of the frame ju&s;t to fit a ten gallon cask, that was la&s;hed to the battens at each end, and the long &s;quare &s;paces on each &s;ide of the cask filled with birch broom &s;tuff projecting about &s;ix inches without the frame, and wedged fa&s;t towards the ends with long wedges again&s;t boards that &s;lides with &s;mall tenants at each end in a groove to keep the birch fa&s;t and firm, for &s;crubbing the bottom, even clo&s;e down to the keel, and the iron work which unites the two parts by a joint that they may the more naturally ply to the curved or rounding parts of the &s;hip's bottom, with the &s;lings and the ropes fa&s;tened to the eye bolts, may all be perceived and under&s;tood by looking with attention at the figure that repre&s;ents that &s;ide of the &s;crubber that is hauled next to the &s;hip's bottom.</P>
<P>IN u&s;ing this cask-&s;crubber we bad a block la&s;hed under the bow|&s;prit end, and another on the driver boom rigged out right aft, and a &s;ingle rope reeved in the&s;e blocks, and made fa&s;t to the &s;lings marked 1, 2, in the figure, and ju&s;t long enough to veer and haul the &s;crubber along the bottom fore and aft clo&s;e to the keel, an|other rope bent to the lower part of the &s;crubber, as marked 3, and hauled tight under the bottom, and made fa&s;t to the in&s;ide of the boat's main thoft, when the upper part of the &s;crubber is even with the water's edge a mid&s;hips on the other &s;ide, then the peo|ple was ordered to walk fore and aft with the rope to the &s;crubber, till it came up to the water's edge each way, the boat moving the &s;ame way with the &s;crubber, the people in her helping by pu&s;hing

their hands again&s;t the &s;hip's &s;ide, till the fir&s;t depth is thought to be clean enough, then the people in the boat hauls by their rope the &s;crubber a depth lower, by which, and the empty casks, it is confined and pre&s;&s;ed to the bottom at the different depths, till it is &s;crubbed clean down to and even the keel it&s;elf, by the rope go|ing fore and aft under it.</P>

<P>FOR the above rea&s;ons, the people &s;hould, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, be all &s;tationed or quartered to the be&s;t advantage, according to their capacities; the olde&s;t and be&s;t &s;eamen to be captains of the great guns, the young, nimble, and expert, to the rigging and tops, the landmen to the &s;mall arms, and the boys to be powder carriers for the great guns, &amp;c. and as they come on board, if it is po&s;&s;ible that it can be done, they &s;hould be exerci&s;ed accordingly; and to encourage and make them willing they &s;hould be told, that not only their &s;ucce&s;s but their &s;afety as well as liberty depends upon their being expert in their exerci&s;e, which &s;hould be with as few, ea&s;y, &s;imple words and motions, as po&s;&s;ible, both for the great guns and &s;mall arms, that they may the &s;ooner be fit for action.</P>
<P>THE exerci&s;e of the great guns, as reduced from 40 words of com|mand, (as they u&s;ed to be,) to 14, are very well de&s;cribed in <HI>Falconer</HI>'s marine dictionary. But this being for the guns on the common car|riages, I take the liberty to mention the difference we u&s;ed for the &s;wivel carriages. At the word of command, ca&s;t loo&s;e the gun, the train or one of the gun tackles is hooked from an eye bolt amid-&s;hips, to the train of the &s;ole of the carriage, and the gun bow&s;ed in, till it has room to be breeched about to the foremo&s;t pall, turned down for
<PB N="174" REF="187">
that purpo&s;e; then turn down the after pall, which done, the guns are then ready to be run out either for exerci&s;e or action. And when the gun is run out, the two palls are to be turned back, with one motion, then the gun may be breeched about, and pointed by hand, fore or aft, on the object, or enemy, as much as the width of the port will allow. And when the object, or enemy, is much before the beam, let the guns be run out clo&s;e to the after part of the ports, and when abaft the beam clo&s;e to the fore part of the ports, that they may be pointed more fore or aft, as the occa&s;ion may require, and the breechings not being &s;eized, but rendered through the thimble at the breech, make both parts tight alike to bring the guns up in any direction they may be fired in, ei|ther foreward or aft. And when the guns are run in, breech about their muzzles forward, to load, then turn down the foremo&s;t pall, and breech the gun to it, and then down after pall, to run out the gun again, as before mentioned.</P>
<P>THE exerci&s;e of &s;mall arms I would recommend that it &s;hould be done with as few motions as po&s;&s;ible (and as is done in the front rank of our army) kneeling upon the right knee, and only ri&s;ing up to fire, as the place and occa&s;ion may require; which not only keeps the peo|ple under &s;helter, but firm in their place, to do their duty without being to&s;ted about by the &s;hips motion in the &s;ea, e&s;pecially the land|men who cannot be expected to have got their &s;ea legs, as it is called, &s;o as to &s;tand firm to load their guns, when the &s;hip has much moti|on.</P>

<HEAD>On Exerci&s;ing Manoeuvres; how to atack or defend a Ship.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as the &s;hip has got to &s;ea, I would recommend what was my practice, that is, to take the fir&s;t po&s;&s;ible opportunity to have all hands called to quarters; the officers, in their &s;tations, to have every thing made properly ready and fit for action; to have a general exerci&s;e, not only of the great guns and &s;mall arms, as before mentioned, but the method of working and managing the &s;hip, to take the advantage of the openings, that I know, from experience, often occur, in attack|ing, or being attacked by another &s;ingle &s;hip, which &s;hould be &s;tudi|ed by every commander, and the de&s;igned manoeuvers &s;hould be taught the people in their general exerci&s;e, that they may know how to act,
<PB N="175" REF="188">
and move regularly from one place and &s;ide to the other, as the oc|ca&s;ion may require, without confu&s;ion, which is always the con&s;e|quence, when the intention and management of the manoeuveres are not made known to the people in general.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e rea&s;on, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, I u&s;ed to make known to the people in general, that when a &s;hip, of near equal force, brought to with a de&s;ign to fight us, my intention was not to run directly along &s;ide, and lie to like a log, and depend upon meer battering, with one &s;ide only; nor upon the &s;tern chace guns. When it is found that there is no chance of running from a &s;hip of much &s;uperior force chac|ing us, and when their be&s;t &s;ailing is upon a wind, it is a common practice for them to run up and bring to under the lee, in a trumphant manner, depending on their &s;uperior power, commonly demanding immediate &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, without expecting any re&s;i&s;tance. The de&s;igned manner of re&s;i&s;ting or attacking, I always endeavoured to conceal as long as po&s;&s;ible, as mentioned page 160; and the&s;e two ca&s;es give all the advantages de&s;ired by my method. Begining the attack upon the weather quarter, &s;hooting the &s;hip up in the wind, with the helm a lee, till the after lee gun, which we begin with, can be pointed upon the enemy's &s;tern, then fire the lee-broad &s;ide, as it may be called, as repre&s;ented in plate the 8th. The &s;hip (figure 1) begins the attack upon the &s;hip (figure 2) when the top&s;ails are thrown a back, with the helm a lee, boxes the &s;hip &s;hort round on her heels, as mentioned in box hauling, page 52, &s;o as to bring the wind &s;o far aft, that the &s;hip may immediately be &s;teered clo&s;e under the enemy's &s;tern, as the &s;hip (figure 3) is repre&s;ented, run|ning under the &s;tern of the &s;hip (figure 4) with particular orders to begin with the foremo&s;t gun, to rake them right fore and aft with the great guns, as they pa&s;s in that line of direction, all aiming and &s;iring to break the neck or cheeks of the rudder head, the tiller, ropes, blocks, &amp;c. that, if po&s;&s;ible, to de&s;troy the &s;teerage tackle; which de&s;ign, if it proves &s;ucce&s;sful, takes the management of their &s;hip from them, &s;o that &s;he mu&s;t lie helple&s;s, for a time in &s;pite of their endeavours; and when the aftermo&s;t gun is fired, put the helm hard a weather to bring the &s;hip by the wind, and then &s;tand off on the other tack, to keep clear of their lee broad &s;ide, and act according to their motions, and the experience of the effect your attack has had upon them. If they continue to lie to, either to renew the attack again, in the &s;ame man|ner, as &s;oon as the &s;hip will fetch their weather quarter again, or to
<PB N="176" REF="189">
make &s;ail off to e&s;cape, if it has been found that the great inequality of their &s;uperior force admits of no po&s;&s;ible chance of conquering them; though this manoeuvere may have given this advantage, which, in my opinion, ought always to be attempted, and not to &s;ubmit tamely, tho' a &s;hip is above double the force, becau&s;e by this manoeuvere the power of their broad &s;ides may be chiefly avoided.</P>
<P>But when the inequality of force is not &s;o great, but there is a po&s;&s;ibi|lity of conquering; and if the &s;ucce&s;s of the fir&s;t attack is perceived to oblige the enemy to continue lying to, in order to repair the damage done their rudder or tiller, &amp;c. then the blow &s;hould be followed, by renewing the attack again with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, in the &s;ame manner, which gives the opening not only to fire the whole round of great guns, to advantage, but al&s;o to the marines and topmen to fire their &s;mall arms, at the &s;ame time, to great advantange, to do the mo&s;t execution po&s;&s;ible by firing and raking them fore and aft thro' their mo&s;t open and tender part, the &s;tern, with the lea&s;t ri&s;k po&s;&s;ible from the enemies guns, therefore gives the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible chance, that I known of, to make an ea&s;y conque&s;t, e&s;pecially, if &s;o lucky as to de&s;troy, and prevent, the recovery of their &s;teerage. A &s;hip of much &s;uperior force may be brought to &s;uch a di&s;tre&s;t condition as to be obliged to make a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion for want of the helm to command her, therefore when an opportunity offers, in fighting, this &s;hould be al|ways aimed at.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the enemy laid to as above mentioned, find them&s;elves not much hurt by this manoeuvere, and that you have not &s;ucceeded in de&s;troying their &s;teerage, and therefore you may expect that they will immediately tack, or ware &s;hip, and &s;tand after you, depending on their advantages of &s;ailing fa&s;ter, and &s;uperior force, runs up along your lee &s;ide, expecting, by making a general di&s;charge of their &s;mall arms and great guns (charged with &s;uitable &s;hot) on your deck, which lies open to them by the &s;hip heeling, to de&s;troy your people and to make you &s;ubmit. When this is likely to be their de&s;ign, orders &s;hould be given to your people to keep them&s;elves as &s;nug under &s;hel|ter as po&s;&s;ible from their &s;mall &s;hot, till their general di&s;charge is over, then if the &s;hip is found not &s;o di&s;abled, but that the top&s;ails can be thrown a back, to make a general di&s;charge, from the lee &s;ide, of the great guns, loaded with round &s;hot only, pointed to the weather &s;ide of the enemies bottom, amid-&s;hips to one point, at the water edge, and box haul the &s;hip to run clo&s;e under their &s;tern, aiming at raking
<PB N="177" REF="190">
and de&s;troying their &s;teerage, with the other broad &s;ide, and &s;tand off on the other tack as before mentioned, to act according to circum|&s;tance and the condition you find your&s;elves in, compared with the ap|pearance of that of the enemy and their motions, who may be obliged to continue on the other tack to repair damages about their rudder, or to &s;top their leaks in the weather &s;ide of their bottom, if your aim has proved &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>BUT when an enemy's &s;hip of force makes only a running fight, if there is no nece&s;&s;ity to cut them off from the &s;hore or from the &s;hel|ter of other &s;hips, &amp;c. and you have the advantage of &s;ailing fa&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an ene+my of force making a running fight.</NOTE> the mo&s;t &s;ure and likely method to make an ea&s;y conque&s;t with the lea&s;t hurt to your&s;elves, or their &s;hip, (your expected prize,) is to run clo&s;e up and &s;hoot or &s;heer your &s;hip acro&s;s their &s;tern each way, making a general di&s;charge of all your force, fir&s;t with one broad &s;ide, then the other, always aiming with the great guns at the rudder head, and &s;teerage tackling for the rea&s;ons given, that if the &s;hot mi&s;s the rud|der, &amp;c. they by raking the &s;hip fore and aft through the &s;tern, does the greate&s;t execution po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tre&s;s them &s;o as to make a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>ON this occa&s;ion when it blows fre&s;h, and obliges to carry a pre&s;|&s;ing &s;ail large, or before the wind, to make the great guns as ready as po&s;&s;ible, and prevent their being fired too low, all their breeches &s;hould be laid quite down in the carriages, and if your &s;hip is crank, the yards &s;hould be braced, &s;o as to &s;hiver the &s;ails at the time each broad &s;ide is fired.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e manoeuvers, when the whole round of great guns are de&s;igned to be fired, care &s;hould always be taken to leave two or more men, as it may require, to charge each gun again when fired on one &s;ide, whil&s;t the others move over to fire the guns on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, that neither &s;ide may be left unguarded, all which with every other advantageous manoeuver that may be de&s;igned to be put in practice, in action,<NOTE PLACE="marg">On exer+ci&s;ing with a ri&s;k to point the guns and fire at.</NOTE> &s;hould be taught the people along with the general exerci&s;e of great guns, and &s;mall arms (as before hinted that I have done), by throwing a tight empty beef ca&s;k over board, making it the object of attack, for all the guns to be pointed at, when performing the above de&s;cribed or other intended manoeuvers about it, fir&s;t by running a little way large from it, then haul the wind tack &s;hip and &s;tand to|wards it, keeping it about three points on the lee bow till within a half cables length, or mu&s;ket &s;hot of it, then put the helm alee, and
<PB N="178" REF="191">
&s;hoot the &s;hip up in the wind with the top&s;ails aback, till the after gun can be pointed to the ca&s;k, then give the word of command to fire, when there is a fair opening to make a general di&s;charge, both below and aloft on that &s;ide as repre&s;ented (plate the 8th) the &s;hip figure 1, begining the attack on the weather quarter of the &s;hip, figure 2, as before de&s;cribed, which the ca&s;k may be &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent, as well as the &s;hip figure 4; when you have box hauled your &s;hip, and run clo&s;e pa&s;t the ca&s;k to make a general di&s;charge from the other &s;ide, as repre&s;ented by the &s;hip, figure 3, then bearing round away from it, waring and haul the wind on the other tack, till you can tack and fetch up to it again to repeat this, or perform any other manoeu|vers that may give an advantage to attack or defend a &s;hip laid to, or &s;ailing upon a wind as above mentioned. To perform the ma|noeuver of attacking an enemy that makes a running fight large, or before the wind, it is only to turn far enough to windward of the ca&s;k, to give room in &s;ailing down to it to bring the &s;hips broad &s;ide to point to it each way. But to perform this manoeuver to the great|e&s;t advantage, with the lea&s;t lo&s;s of time, and the &s;hips way through the water, which may be of great importance on this occa&s;ion to keep clo&s;e up with the enemy, therefore all the great guns &s;hould be run out clo&s;e to the after part of the ports, that they may be pointed as far forward as the &s;ides of the ports will admit, and elevated as the heeling of the &s;hip when brought to, to fire may require as before mentioned. And particular orders &s;hould be given for the aftermo&s;t guns on each &s;ide to be fired fir&s;t, as &s;oon as they can be brought to bear upon the enemy, becau&s;e, then the &s;hip need not be brought any more to, but &s;teered in that direction till the other guns are fired, then &s;hift the helm to ware to bring the other broad &s;ide to bear, &amp;c.</P>
<P>AFTER the people have been thus di&s;ciplined, it is nece&s;&s;ary to let them &s;mell powder, as it is termed. And a little ammunition &s;pent in exerci&s;e is allowed, may be the means to &s;ave a great deal expended to little or no purpo&s;e in action, therefore I u&s;ed to allow a &s;mall charge of powder for the round of great guns, with &s;tone balla&s;t for &s;hot, and the mu&s;keteers two charges with balls each, and give them a fair chance, by the&s;e manoeuvers to fire both broad &s;ides, great guns and &s;mall arms at the ca&s;k, if they &s;unk it all hands to have an allow|ance of grog, as it is called, but if they did not &s;ink it, to have the trouble and mortification to hoi&s;t out the boat and fetch it on board
<PB N="179" REF="192">
to &s;erve another time, by &s;ome &s;uch means and methods only, it is po&s;&s;ible to make the people expert in their duty to fight a &s;hip to the greate&s;t advantages. But two &s;hips in concert exerci&s;ing the different manoeuvers, by turns as might be agreed upon, and making a &s;ham fight with powder only would contribute mo&s;t to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e, and to find out the be&s;t trim of their &s;hips for &s;ailing, by the people moving fore and aft with as many &s;hot as they all can carry with them, &amp;c.</P>

<P>CRUISING the war before la&s;t in the employ of that great hero <HI>Fortunatus Wright,</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranian</HI> &s;ea, where the wind blows generally either ea&s;terly or we&s;terly, that is either up or down the &s;traits, therefore it was planned, with either of the&s;e winds that blew, to &s;teer up or down the common channels the common cour&s;e, large or before the wind in the day time without any &s;ail &s;et, that the ene|my's trading &s;hips a &s;tern crouding &s;ail with this fair wind might come up in &s;ight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">On crui&s;ing without &s;ail in the day, and under top|&s;ails at night.</NOTE> or we come in &s;ight of tho&s;e &s;hips a head that might be turning to windward, and at &s;un&s;et if nothing appeared to an officer at the ma&s;t head, we continued to run five or &s;ix leagues as far as could then be &s;een before we laid the &s;hip to for the night, to prevent the &s;hips a&s;tern coming up and pa&s;&s;ing out of &s;ight before morning, or we pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e &s;hips that might be turning to windward, and if nothing appeared to an officer at the ma&s;t head at &s;unri&s;e we bore away and &s;teer|ed as before. And when the wind blowed acro&s;s the channels that &s;hips could &s;ail their cour&s;e either up or down, then to keep the &s;hip in a fair way, in the day time to &s;teer the common cour&s;e under the cour&s;es and lower &s;tay-&s;ails, and in the night under top-&s;ails with the cour&s;es in the brails, with all things as ready as po&s;&s;ible to take or leave what we might fall in with in the night.</P>

<P>FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons, without the time, &s;ituations, circum&s;tances, and appearance require immediately to give chace with all your &s;ail at the fir&s;t &s;ight of a ve&s;&s;el, otherwi&s;e it often happens that you may &s;tand a much better chance to &s;peak with a ve&s;&s;el by endeavouring to way lay and conceal your de&s;ign and &s;hip from them, which may be done even in the day time with all the &s;ails furled as beforementioned, till within about four leagues di&s;tance, that is computed a &s;hips hull in a clear horri&s;on begins to appear above it. When this concealment can be made, and to be all ready prepared to take or leave, and can fall in with the expected enemy in the night, or early next morning if they are found unprepared for action, mu&s;t give a great advantage over them. But when you cannot be concealed from the expected enemies ve&s;&s;els in &s;ight that may be coming with a fair wind towards you, then it &s;hould be con&s;idered whether in&s;tead of giving chace with all your &s;ail &s;et in fine weather, it may not be better to di&s;gui&s;e your &s;hip to appear as an inoffen&s;ive neutral &s;hip, by geting your fore and mizen topgallant yards down, and the ma&s;t &s;truck with only their heads above the caps, as mentioned page the 18th, and either &s;tand upon the wind with the maintop gallant &s;ail &s;et, if not noticed till by tacking you can fetch near the intended chace.

<P>IN cha&s;ing, all po&s;&s;ible pains &s;hould be taken, to &s;et and trim the &s;ails to the be&s;t advantage, as has been mentioned on that &s;ubject, and to con&s;ider the properties of your &s;hip, if &s;he excels mo&s;t in &s;ailing upon a wind, when cha&s;ing with a leading wind, the cha&s;e &s;hould be kept upon your weather bow, to prevent her getting to leeward of you; but if you excell mo&s;t in &s;ailing large, and not upon a wind, the cha&s;e &s;hould be kept upon the lee bow to prevent her getting to windward of you; or according to the motions of the chace, that will naturally endeavour to make u&s;e of the &s;ame advantages of their be&s;t &s;ailing, and if they are a light &s;hip, or lightly loaded, they will &s;ail better large than upon a wind, and if a deep loaded &s;hip, better upon a wind than large, &amp;c all which de&s;erves notice; to chace to the be&s;t advantage, and as &s;oon as it can be done, the helms-man &s;hould &s;ee, and be directed how to keep and &s;teer &s;teady by the chace, independent of the cun, which is known to help a &s;hips &s;ailing to come up with the cha&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT it often happens in cha&s;iing, that night comes on, which makes it very uncertain how long, or whether the chace can be &s;een or not, though many may pretend to &s;ee her plain, long after &s;he has been lo&s;t &s;ight of by the commander, who &s;hould not depend upon other peoples eyes without trying every now and then, whether they point to &s;ee the chace, in one and the &s;ame part of the horizon, when the &s;hip is privately ordered to be wared about from her cour&s;e, a point or two of the compa&s;s each way, and according as they agree or di&s;agree from this rule, either to continue or leave off chace, and crowd &s;ail to get a-head and way lay the chace, in the way they &s;eemed to be bound, which from experience I can &s;ay gives the be&s;t chance of fall|ing in with them again.</P>

<HEAD>On towing and rowing a &s;hip in chace</HEAD>
<P>CHASING in little winds and calms, may often require both to tow and row the &s;hip with oars, therefore, to do it in the mo&s;t advantageous manner, de&s;erves notice. When towing a &s;hip to make her &s;teer and work, it may require the tow rope not only from the bow&s;prit end, but from the jib boom-end which will give more power in pro|portion as it is farther from the &s;hips turning motion to pull her about, but when towing to give a &s;hip the mo&s;t head way po&s;&s;ible, the tow rope &s;hould be made fa&s;t no higher than nece&s;&s;ary to keep it clear of the water.</P>
<P>TO row the &s;hip with oars, the oars &s;hould be made &s;uitable to the room the &s;hip affords to row and &s;tow them. In the <HI>Liverpool</HI> privateer, before mentioned, we rowed with eleven oars on each &s;ide, and &s;culled with two, run out right aft, after the manner of the <HI>Chi|ne&s;e.</HI> And in order to add more power, by more people pulling alto|gether at the oars on each &s;ide, and prevent the confu&s;ion and hind|rance that is occa&s;ioned by the people's not pulling altogether, we had &s;wifters for each &s;ide made of &s;ingle ropes with gromits in them, at the &s;ame di&s;tance of the row ports from each other, and put on the handles of the oars &s;o that men could pull between the oars by the&s;e &s;wifters, which after a little practice, &s;oon made all the people pull completely together.</P>
<P>THE two &s;culling oars abaft were made crooked or curved, with the flat of their blades bending downwards, and an iron &s;ocket nailed to the under part of the oar at the port, when the blade was flat in the water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">On &s;cull+ing Oars</NOTE> and a &s;hort bolt tapered and filed like a wood-&s;crew, with a round head, was fixed in the middle of the ports for the oars to turn upon, and &s;taples in the deck, right under the handle of the oars, to hook a line with an eye-&s;plice on the handle of the oar that bears the &s;train, whil&s;t the men &s;cull by &s;tanding on each &s;ide of the handle of the oar, and only have to pull to, and pu&s;h from them with all their &s;trength, which makes the blade cant and act &s;lanting downwards in|to the water each way with great power, to give the &s;hip head way, and may likewi&s;e help to &s;teer the &s;hip and bring her about from one tack to the other, when it cannot be done by the rudder, and &s;weep

a &s;hip's &s;tern about as occa&s;ion may require, when engaging in a calm.<NOTE PLACE="marg">On &s;cull|ing in China.</NOTE> The comparative power and effect of &s;culling oars, to force a ve&s;&s;el through the water, is indi&s;putably proved in <HI>China,</HI> where the people appeared to me no ways expert in their navigation, but in this method of &s;culling all their very numerous river ve&s;&s;els and pa&s;&s;age boats great and &s;mall without any &s;ail or rudder; and this they do in a more dexterous ea&s;y and expeditious manner, in my opinion, than any other part of the world that I have &s;een. I have ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure their ve&s;&s;els with 20 tons of goods and room to accommodate their families, &s;culled by two men only, from the city of <HI>Canton</HI> (20 miles) to our &s;hips, &s;temming and &s;culling again&s;t the tide, running above two miles an hour and laying the &s;hips on board in a &s;afe and ea&s;y manner. And not only their large river ve&s;&s;els, but their &s;mall boats are moved very fa&s;t through the water by this method of &s;culling. I was one in a fine eight oar'd pinnace that was beat with ea&s;e and laughed at by two men in one of their common bumb-boats in &s;pite of our utmo&s;t endeavours, this therefore de&s;erves notice, and might in my opinion be brought into u&s;eful practice among us, on many occa&s;ions, in narrow rivers, canals, boats to land numbers of men where there is not room to row with oars, and our whale boats, &amp;c. for with the very power they &s;cull the ve&s;&s;el a-head they &s;teer her at the &s;ame time, which mu&s;t on this account be much better than a rudder, that &s;tops water, as has been ob&s;erved on rudders. I cannot forbear here remarking that the&s;e <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> &s;culling ve&s;&s;els are built upon good principles to an&s;wer their purpo&s;e, as all ve&s;&s;els that are to be moved with oars or paddles ought to be, having flat rounding bottoms, with flanging projecting bows and &s;terns, without keel, &s;tem or &s;tern po&s;t to hinder their ready turning, and drawing &s;o little water that they are ea&s;ily made to &s;kim in a manner, at a great rate over the &s;urface of it, where the par|ticles give way much ea&s;ier than they can do at a greater depth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">On Por+po&s;&s;es &s;culling with the tails.</NOTE> and their method of &s;culling makes (them as much as po&s;&s;ible for art) to imitate the nature of <HI>Porpoi&s;es,</HI> which &s;cull with their horizontal tails &s;wifter than any other fi&s;h we &s;ee at &s;ea, where they frequently &s;eem to &s;port and mock a &s;hip when &s;ailing at the rate of ten miles an hour and will &s;wim as may be ob&s;erved &s;culling with their horizontal tails cro&s;s and cro&s;s the &s;hips bows at &s;uch an angle, that they cannot go le&s;s than at the rate of 30 miles an hour, which mu&s;t be allowed to make greatly in favour of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> method of &s;culling their ve&s;&s;els, in&s;tead of rowing them as we do with oars, which are levers, and our

method of applying their power in rowing, will in my opinion never be beat, by any complicated machinary.</P>

<HEAD>On coming to action.</HEAD>
<P>NOW we may &s;uppo&s;e a &s;hip to have come up &s;o far with her cha&s;e, as to perceive them to have the appearance of enemies and preparing for action, then the appearance of their force and motions, &s;hould be &s;trictly ob&s;erved by the commanding officer, and he mu&s;t pro|ceed accordingly, to make all nece&s;&s;ary preparations in good time again&s;t the wor&s;t that may happen, guarding again&s;t being &s;urprized unprepar|ed by any &s;ham appearance and motions that may be u&s;ed to deceive, as I was in a cruizing &s;hip the war before la&s;t, when the &s;tarboard &s;ide of our mizen top was &s;hot away by the enemy before our com|mander would permit all hands to be called to clear &s;hip for action.</P>
<P>WHEN come &s;o near to the enemy in chace, that they prepare and fire their &s;tern chace guns, which is a &s;ign of weakne&s;s and fear, and which commonly gives joy to the cha&s;ing &s;hip, though it mu&s;t be allowed to give them a chance of &s;hooting away &s;ome of your ma&s;ts and helps their &s;hip forward, but as &s;ucce&s;s depends entirely upon gett|ing clo&s;e up to have them at command; therefore without &s;ome good rea&s;on you &s;hould not be tempted to fire your bow-chace guns, becau&s;e they will &s;top your &s;hip's head way that may occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of your expected prize.</P>
<P>BUT when the chace is perceived to be a &s;hip of force preparing and clearing &s;hip for action without running out their &s;tern chace guns, then all po&s;&s;ible pains and expedition &s;hould be u&s;ed to clear &s;hip, and make all the nece&s;&s;ary preparations, that the circum&s;tances of the time and attack may &s;eem to require, to have the yards &s;lung, the top-&s;ail &s;heets &s;topperd, to leave nothing to be done but to haul up the cour&s;es to come regularly to action.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">On pro|viding drink for the people.</NOTE>ANOTHER preparation I would recommend when by the enemy's appearance it is likely to prove a hard battle, and &s;ighting vigorou&s;ly e&s;pecially with great guns is &s;uch hard work that &s;oon exhau&s;ts the peo|ple's &s;pirits, and makes them &s;o thir&s;ty as to induce them to go from their quarters to get drink; to remedy and prevent this as much as

po&s;&s;ible, when the &s;hip's &s;tores will afford it, (as I have done) to order the &s;hip's &s;teward to prepare and be ready when called on to mix a gal|lon of rum or brandy, according to their &s;trength, with five or &s;ix gallons of water, in a bucket and with a pint pot &s;erve the people round at their quarters, and the top men &s;hould have a can &s;lung to haul up their allowance.</P>
<P>TO &s;uppo&s;e cha&s;ing with the wind large, and that the enemy hauls up his cour&s;es and brings to, in form of battle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">On run|ing end on to begin the attack.</NOTE> with the main|top &s;ail aback, &amp;c. as if he thought it mo&s;t advantageous to begin the attack, by firing his broad &s;ide to rake you fore and aft, as you are running down large, right end on towards his broad &s;ide, which in my opinion, is a manoeuvre that by <HI>Britons</HI> ought never to be refu&s;ed, though it was given as a rea&s;onable excu&s;e, for a late un|fortunate Admiral's not running right down upon the enemy, who laid to waiting for him, for I can &s;ay from rea&s;on as well as experience, when running right down upon the enemy we have received two broad &s;ides in the time, without receiving any damage of con&s;e|quence, for it &s;hould be con&s;idered running in that direction, a &s;hip is not above a quarter part as big an object for the enemy to hit, as when broad &s;ide to, and the &s;hape of the bows and built much the &s;tronge&s;t part of a &s;hip, and may deflect many &s;hot that may hit her in that &s;lanting direction.</P>
<P>THEREFORE I think it a point of duty on this occa&s;ion to run right down, and bring to with the the top-&s;ails aback, clo&s;e on the enemy's weather quarter, and begin the attack by making a general di&s;charge from the lee &s;ide, then box haul the &s;hip, and run clo&s;e under their &s;tern, and make a general di&s;charge from the other &s;ide, aiming at raking them fore and aft, and if the power of the enemy appears to require it, put the helm hard over, to bring the &s;hip by the wind on the other tack, till you can fetch the enemy's weather quarter again, if they continue to lie too, then put the &s;hip about, and repeat the attack by the &s;ame manoeuvre, as before fully de&s;cribed, (as well as that of attacking a &s;hip of force that makes a running &s;ight) in the exerci&s;e of the&s;e manoeuvres beginning at page 174. A fore-&s;tay &s;ail, as before mentioned, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;ight|ing &s;hip to make her manageable on the&s;e occa&s;ions, when her cour&s;es are brailed up.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="199">BUT it mu&s;t be allowed, that a &s;hip is liable to be di&s;abled in her ma&s;ts, yards, rigging, &amp;c &s;o as to hinder the performing, often the above-mentioned manoeuvre, &s;till all advantages and openings are to be taken, and none given to the enemy in fighting; and I know from experience, that our people fight much more to advantage, in proportion as they are brought near to the enemy, who we will &s;uppo&s;e continues lying too to fight, and that your &s;hip may be di&s;|abled from, or think it unnece&s;&s;ary to perform the above mentioned manoeuvre, even then, I would recommend to begin the attack clo&s;e upon the enemy's weather quarter, as the &s;hip figure 1 is repre&s;ented, attacking the &s;hip figure 2, plate the 8th, and only by backing and filling the &s;ails, as the circum&s;tances of your own, and the enemy's &s;hip and people may be ob&s;erved to require.</P>
<P>IN performing this manoeuvre, of backing and filling when the enemy lays his &s;hip too to fight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">On attack+ing by back|ing and fill|ing the &s;ails</NOTE> as la&s;t mentioned, it &s;hould be made a certain rule, at your &s;hip getting &s;tern way by backing the &s;ails, that the helm &s;hould be put hard a-weather, to make her back the farther a-&s;tern, before &s;he lo&s;es her &s;tern way, &s;o as to gain the more room to get &s;ufficient head-way upon your &s;hip, to be more under command of the helm to &s;teer and &s;hoot her at plea&s;ure, either on the lee or weather quarter of the enemy who lying to with their helm a-lee, is under no command, but alternately comes to and falls off from the wind, which may being ob&s;erved take the advantage and &s;hoot your &s;hip up in the wind clo&s;e under and acro&s;s their &s;tern, raking them fore and aft with what may be called your lee broad &s;ide, and after that, the &s;hip may be backed and boxed off at plea&s;ure, to fill and &s;hoot up upon the enemy's lee quarter, to di&s;charge your weather broad&s;ide, and back all the &s;ails, e&s;pecially after &s;ail, with the helm a-weather when the &s;hip gets &s;tern way, to make her back the farther a-&s;tern of the enemy, where all the guns may be loaded again, and all things made properly ready with more &s;afety to repeat the attack in the &s;ame manner if the enemy continues to lie to, which may be done by the above management, for in making the &s;tern board with the helm a-weather and the after &s;ails &s;harp aback, your &s;hip rather gains ground to windward, whil&s;t the enemy with the maintop-&s;ail only a|back drives to leeward and &s;hoots a-head, &s;o that when your &s;ternway is done, by filling your after-&s;ails, your &s;hip may be loffed up to fetch up under the enemy's &s;tern again, to act as their &s;ituation and behavi|our compared with your own may admitt.</P>

<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed that our world, and &s;y&s;tem of worlds, and the whole creation, as far as we can ob&s;erve, are governed by the AL|MIGHTY CREATOR, pre&s;ent to all parts that are moved by His general laws, &s;o as to be &s;ub&s;ervient to an&s;wer all the ju&s;t purpo&s;es, not only of His general, but &s;uperintending &s;pecial Providence. Yet we are told, by Revelation, that our ever BLESSED SAVOUR, maker of the world, who &s;hewed his command of the elements and all na|ture, as far as we know, accu&s;ed the Jews who would not de&s;cern the &s;igns of the times as foretold re&s;pecting Him&s;elf, but the &s;igns of the weather by ob&s;ervations, "when the &s;ky was red in the evening, a &s;ign of fair weather, but when red and lowering in the morning a &s;ign of foul weather, when &s;eeing a cloud ri&s;e out of the we&s;t, there cometh a &s;hower; and &s;o it is.

And St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in his voyage to <HI>Rome,</HI> in the &s;ea&s;on of the year when &s;ailing was become dangerous, told what would be the con&s;equence to the Centurion, who believed the owner and ma&s;ter of the &s;hip more than St. <HI>Paul,</HI> when the &s;outh wind

<P>BETWEEN and near the tropicks, it has been often remarked by the learned, that both winds and weather are mo&s;tly periodical at different &s;ea&s;ons of the year, the barometer varies but very little; but in higher latitudes both north and &s;outh, like the winds and weather it varies greatly all the year round, as mentioned pages 4, 5, 6, and tho' this in&s;trument is found defective at times, yet it mu&s;t be allowed the be&s;t guide we have for the purpo&s;e of &s;hewing &s;igns of good or bad weather; and I have been lately told from good au|thority and experience, that the ingenious <HI>Edward Narn,</HI> optition, makes the marine barometer to &s;tand the &s;hip's motion at &s;ea without being di&s;turbed as before-metioned. I mu&s;t own the many years ob|&s;ervations I have made on the barometer (&s;ince I printed off the above pages) I have often been di&s;apointed in expecting an ea&s;terly wind from the gla&s;s being high, which I find happens with we&s;terly as well as all other winds, and that a quick ri&s;e as well as a quick fall of the quick|&s;ilver &s;hews changeable and uncertain weather. And that the&s;e changes of the weather and winds no way depend upon the &s;ituation or pha&s;es of the moon, or the &s;un at the equinoxes, as they are too generally thought to do in this climate.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, it is not to be doubted, but that alterations are made in the den&s;ity of the different parts of the atmo&s;phere, that may cau&s;e the elements to move &s;o as to give the appearences in the &s;ky, from which the&s;e &s;igns and &s;ayings had their ri&s;e. The evening red, and the morning gray, is the &s;ign of a fine day. A clear N. W. and a foul S. E. horizon a fi&s;herman's night. A rainbow or weather gall at morn, fine weather all gone. But a rain|bow towards night, fair weather in &s;ight. It is reckoned a bad &s;ign when tere&s;tial objects at a di&s;tance appear extraordinary clear and near, and when the &s;tars appear very numerous and glaring the fir&s;t of the night.

<P>THE mo&s;t common method is to cut away the &s;hip's ma&s;ts, e&s;pe|cially the main and mizen ma&s;ts, in order to make her ware and bring the wind on the other &s;ide, but rea&s;on, as well as experience, has often proved that this de&s;perate, and expen&s;ive method, has not an&s;wer|ed the purpo&s;e, for the &s;hip's hull in that po&s;ition, greatly becalms the ma&s;ts, e&s;pecially the lower ma&s;ts and &s;ails, and prevents the rudder from having the effect upon the water as to make the &s;hip ware. In further confirmation of this I was told by a commander that put this de&s;perate remedy in practice, that it would not have an&s;wered the de&s;ign, if it had not happened from an accident that &s;ome of the lower &s;tanding rigging on the lee &s;ide being omitted to be cut, brought the ma&s;ts up, and made &s;uch &s;top waters on the lee quarter, as that only cau&s;|ed the &s;hip to ware.</P>
<P>I HAVE heard of another accident, that recovered a light coal &s;hip that had canted her balla&s;t at &s;ea, and over&s;et &s;o low on her &s;ide, that the bower anchor happened by chance to go from the lee bow, and the cable running out that it took hold in the ground &s;o as to bring the wind a-head, which took the &s;ails aback, and ca&s;t the &s;hip on the other tack, when they &s;oon got her trimmed upright again.

And &s;uppo&s;e the &s;hip is found imbay'd, &s;o that &s;he will not clear the &s;hore on one tack, and that the waves run &s;o high that the &s;hip will not &s;tay, yet &s;he may be box-hauled and wared to lo&s;e very little ground, as mentioned page 52 on box-haul|ing; and the in&s;tance of turning to windward out of <HI>Mount</HI>'s <HI>Bay,</HI> mentioned page 132, with the method we u&s;ed in box-hauling repre|&s;ented in the figures 1, 2, plate the 7th. Therefore de&s;pair &s;hould not take place, but an example of &s;pirit and re&s;olution &s;hewn by the officers, after having con&s;ulted together, and the people plainly told what is re&s;olved upon, and that there is no other chance left to &s;ave the &s;hip and their lives, but to carry all the &s;ail po&s;&s;ible, to work the &s;hip in the mo&s;t perfect manner; and when &s;he refu&s;es &s;tays to box-haul her, as before fully de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="212">SUPPOSE in this &s;ituation it is found, that the &s;hip will not clear the &s;hore on either tack, and after the utmo&s;t endeavours &s;he is per|ceived to lo&s;e ground; but as there is no anchorage there is no other means but to continue turning to the la&s;t, as the wind may abate, or it may vary or change in your favour, which was the ca&s;e of an in|timate friend of mine, who kept turning though fell to leeward in|&s;tead of getting to windward, under the&s;e unvoidable circum&s;tances, till they thought it would be the la&s;t tack they could po&s;&s;ibly make before they mu&s;t be on &s;hore, when providentially the wind changed, and came right off the &s;hore all at once, which &s;aved both the &s;hip and their lives from immediate de&s;truction.</P>
<P>BUT when this happens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To endea|vour to ride out a &s;torm on a lee &s;hore.</NOTE> where there is clear anchoring ground at a good di&s;tance from the &s;hore, and &s;ailing proves ineffectual to keep clear of it, then the chief dependence mu&s;t be upon the ground tackle rightly applied to the be&s;t advantage; and it is in common reckoned a great di&s;grace to let a &s;hip go on &s;hore with any ground tackle left on board that might have been u&s;efully applied. Suppo&s;e then the &s;hip to be properly prepared, and to have let go a catch anchor, and towline bent like a buoy rope to the crown of the &s;tream anchor, and the inner end of the &s;tream cable bent to the crown of the &s;heet or be&s;t bower anchor, with as long a &s;cope of cable as po&s;&s;ibly can be contrived, to make the &s;hip ride &s;afe and ea&s;y, as is particularly mentioned and recommended page 60 and 61.</P>
<P>BUT where it is known, or found, by &s;ounding with the lead armed with tallow, that the ground is &s;oul, then no more cable &s;hould be veered out than nece&s;&s;ity requires to bring the &s;hip up, to ride with as &s;hort a &s;cope as po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e the cable is liable to be chaifed or cut in two by the rocks; if that happens, there is the more room a&s;tern and a better chance for a &s;econd or third anchor, trying to the la&s;t moment all po&s;&s;ible means to keep the &s;hip from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>WHERE the water is &s;o deep that the anchoring ground lies but a little more than a cable's length from the &s;hore, then all the anchors &s;hould be let go, as fully de&s;cribed to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e page 65 and 66.

Therefore all po&s;&s;ible endeavours &s;hould be u&s;ed, and attempts made to try every thing that can be &s;aid or done, that may prove &s;erviceable on this melancholy and de&s;perate occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>THIS often has, and may be the fate of many &s;hips in &s;pite of the utmo&s;t powers of men; and when a &s;hip's &s;ituation is &s;uch, that, to all appearance it cannot be avoided, then the utmo&s;t endeavours &s;hould be u&s;ed, and no po&s;&s;ible means left undone, that may any way contribute to be &s;erviceable on this la&s;t and mo&s;t im|portant occa&s;ion, to &s;ave all the lives and property that is po&s;&s;ible; whether &s;ucce&s;sful or not it de&s;erves the highe&s;t encomiums, as being the greate&s;t proof of true courage and good conduct.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hips &s;ituations, circum&s;tances, times, and places, are &s;o dif|ferent and various, that to give advice on this dreadful occa&s;ion is difficult; yet, at all hazard, every thing &s;hould be &s;aid and done. For it is well known, from rea&s;on as well as experience, that to let a &s;hip drive at random broad &s;ide, where the tide is flowing upon a moderate ri&s;ing &s;hore, with her mainma&s;t &s;tanding, when &s;he comes to &s;trike hard upon the ground, by the waves running high, will &s;oon over&s;et her on her broad &s;ide, and cau&s;e the hatches to blow off, then the waves will break in at the hatchways and compre&s;s the confined air within her, &s;o as to add the power of blowing to that of beating the &s;hip to pieces, which mu&s;t afford little or no chance to &s;ave either lives or property, that is liable to be de&s;troyed or &s;poiled by the waves, therefore likely to prove a fatal and total lo&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="214">THESE rea&s;ons, I hope, will be thought &s;ufficient to prove the nece&s;&s;ity of endeavouring to point out better management; for it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that a &s;hip going on &s;hore at the&s;e times, in a tide's way, upon a flood, will continue beating as long as the tide flows, and until it falls; and if &s;he lies broad &s;ide to the waves, they will have above three times more the power on her than when laid end on to them, and the mainma&s;t &s;tanding in the main body of the &s;hip occa&s;ions her to over&s;et at &s;uch times; and it is well known, that a &s;hip will bear but little beating upon her broad &s;ide in propor|tion to what &s;he will bear upon her bottom.</P>
<P>THEREFORE the be&s;t conduct, on this occa&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The be&s;t manage|ment on a gradual ri&s;ing &s;hore in a tide way.</NOTE> is to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means to keep the &s;hip from going on &s;uch a &s;hore as this, till after high water; and the main and mizzen ma&s;t being fir&s;t cut away, then to run right before the wind and waves, with all the head way, and &s;ails that po&s;&s;ibly can be &s;et, end on upon the &s;hore, to make the &s;hip free her&s;elf the more, and to run the higher and fa&s;ter upon the ground, &s;o that by the advantage of the tide falling, &s;he may &s;oon be &s;et &s;o fa&s;t as to be out of the power of the waves to hurt her much; by this management, in my opinion, not only all the lives, but the &s;hip and cargo may be often &s;aved, which would be all lo&s;t by letting her go on &s;hore at random with a flowing tide.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING a &s;hip may be thus &s;ucce&s;sfully run and &s;et fa&s;t upon the &s;hore, with little damage to her hull, and no dan|ger to be apprehended till towards high water, the next tide, if the &s;torm continues &s;o long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To wait the be&s;t time to quit the &s;hip.</NOTE> yet people too often let their fears overcome their rea&s;on, and being in too great a hurry to quit the &s;hip, and at|tempting to get through the waves on &s;hore, may often lo&s;e their lives and the boats they go in; when if they would con&s;ider and &s;tay with patience till the tide falls low enough, they may get &s;afe on &s;hore with little or no ri&s;k; and where the tide ri&s;es and falls a great deal the &s;hip may come quite a-dry at low water, which time mu&s;t be allowed to be the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t to land, whether the &s;hip dries or not, for the water is then &s;moothe&s;t, and there will be the le&s;s way to go in it; therefore, if po&s;&s;ible, the people &s;hould be re&s;trained from quitting the &s;hip with the boats till towards low water, and when got &s;afe on &s;hore, it may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the boats, if po&s;&s;ible, by hauling them out of harm's way above high

Therefore, in&s;tead of the common method of laying the oars acro&s;s, and hauling the boat upright over them upon her keel, end on, I would recommend, from experience, fir&s;t, to lay the boat broad &s;ide to the &s;hore, the way &s;he is de&s;igned to be hauled, and healing her off &s;o as to put the blade of a &s;ingle oar under her keel amid &s;hips, and lay all the other oars length way, the blade of one to the loom of the other, then the boat's crew di|vided equally on each &s;ide of the oars, takes hold of the gunnel, healds her bilge upon the fir&s;t oar, keeping her upon a poi&s;e, and runs her along with great ea&s;e, the whole length of the oars at a time; and if a little &s;ea tang can be got to put under the bilge of the boat, it will make her &s;lide with more ea&s;e along the oars, which are to be &s;hifted forward when the boat is on the loom of the la&s;t oar, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>On &s;aving Lives from a Ship lo&s;t on a Lee Shore.</HEAD>
<P>TO be any way aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to &s;ave the lives of people from &s;hips that are forced, or lo&s;t, upon a lee &s;hore, mu&s;t be allowed to be one of the highe&s;t acts of humanity and charity that mankind is capable of performing, and de&s;erves the highe&s;t prai&s;e and the mo&s;t grateful acknowledgments that are po&s;&s;ible to be given. And to offer to de&s;troy or di&s;tre&s;s the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in this lamentable &s;ituation, mu&s;t be deemed the highe&s;t act of villainy, and de&s;erves the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment which our laws very ju&s;tly inflict.</P>
<P>TIME, circum&s;tances, and &s;ituations, are &s;o various, that it is very difficult to write what may be to the purpo&s;e on this mo&s;t melan|choly occa&s;ion. And another defect I mu&s;t own, for which I have great rea&s;on to be thankful to Providence for never having been &s;hip|wrecked, therefore cannot pretend to write from experience; yet, under all the&s;e di&s;advantages, as I think it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that it &s;hould be attempted by &s;ome body, I venture, &s;ailor like, to do my be&s;t.</P>
<P>SUCCESS in many &s;ituations may depend greatly on a&s;&s;i&s;tance from people on &s;hore; but as that is uncertain, and cannot be expected in the night, or in de&s;ert places, therefore the utmo&s;t endeavours &s;hould be u&s;ed to contrive and try what can be done on board a &s;hip, that may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be bulged or broke, &s;o much upon the ground as to be pa&s;t all recovery. And when a current or tide runs &s;o &s;trong between the wreek and the &s;hore, as prevents booms, ma&s;ts, or yards, &amp;c. with ropes made fa&s;t to them, from being veered on &s;hore, and even the patent cork lines that &s;hips have had a board, contrived for the purpo&s;e of veering to people on the &s;hore, in order to get ropes pa&s;&s;ed to make hauling lines, or travellers, from the &s;hip to the &s;hore, as nece&s;&s;ity required, to &s;ave the people, has been rendered ineffectual by the current or tide.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="217"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecperi|ments re|commend|ed to be tried for this noble purpo&s;e.</NOTE>THEREFORE, in order to endeavour to mend the defects of the&s;e contrivances, for this mo&s;t noble purpo&s;e, I take the liberty to pro|po&s;e to tho&s;e in power, to have experiments tried on board his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;hips lying in ordinary, fir&s;t, whether it is not practicable to make a flying kite on board a &s;hip wrecked upon a lee &s;hore, that may, by the force of the wind, be made to carry an iron creeper or grappling, made fa&s;t to the end of a coil of rope, from the wreck to the &s;hore; by which, acce&s;s may be got to the &s;hore, when pre|vented by the tide or current, as above-mentioned?</P>
<P>I WOULD propo&s;e the&s;e kites to be &s;uch, as may be ea&s;ily and rea|dily made on board any wrecked ve&s;&s;el, to con&s;i&s;t only of two &s;lips of thin deal board, about three inches broad, and &s;ix, &s;even, or eight feet long, the middle of one nailed right acro&s;s the other, a little more than a third of their length, which forms what may be called the head part of the kite; then &s;pan it tight round the ends with line, and &s;ew a piece of a light &s;ail over it with a &s;ail needle and twine; then &s;ling it with line from the four ends of the boards with a &s;pan from the middle, to &s;trengthen that part where the bite of the rope, de&s;igned to be &s;ent on &s;hore, is to be &s;topped to the &s;lings; and at the bottom or tale part of the kite, about two fathom from the end of the rope, to which the creeper or grappling is to be bent, that will likewi&s;e an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of a balancing tail, to make the kite mount and fly in a gale of wind with a rope, as well as &s;chool boys common paper kites will do with twine in moderate weather.</P>
<P>NOW let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this &s;torm kite (as it may be called) may be made to fly with a grappling, &amp;c. at its tail from a wreck far enough to reach the &s;hore. But then it may be a&s;ked, how is the kite to be made to fall, &s;o that the grappling may take hold upon the &s;hore to an&s;wer the de&s;igned purpo&s;e? If the occa&s;ion immediately requires this to be done, I would propo&s;e to try the experiment, whe|ther by letting the kite rope &s;uddenly run loo&s;e, for a time, would not make the kite fall down to the ground, as the common kite does when its &s;tring breaks. But without immediate nece&s;&s;ity required to try this method, I would recommend another more &s;ure, and will add farther advantages towards an&s;wering the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE higher and &s;tronger the &s;torm kite flies on this occa&s;ion the better, becau&s;e it will take, what may be called, heavier or more
<PB N="205" REF="218">
me&s;&s;engers, which, in my opinion, may be contrived &s;o as not only to bring the kite down upon the &s;hore, and be a help to hold the kite rope the fa&s;ter, but a hauling line may be al&s;o &s;ent on &s;hore with the fir&s;t me&s;&s;enger, which I would propo&s;e to be made of any piece of wood, &s;par, or plank, 8, 10, or 12 feet long, &s;lung with &s;mall rope from a &s;ingle block to each end in the form of a triangle, &s;titched over with a piece of &s;ail cut in that &s;hape, and the kite rope reeved through the block with a hauling line made fa&s;t to it, which may be &s;ent on &s;hore by it; but if this fir&s;t me&s;&s;enger fails to bring the kite down, a hole may be made near the middle of a main-hatch, or boards, &amp;c. and put upon the kite rope, and the wind will force them up as me&s;|&s;engers, &s;o as &s;oon to bring the kite down upon the &s;hore; but, if it is not likely that any people will be there to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;ecure the kite rope, I would propo&s;e to drive &s;ome large nails to &s;tand out from the lower parts of the wood of the&s;e me&s;&s;engers, to make them hold the kite rope and hauling line, the better to get on &s;hore by them.</P>
<P>SINCE writing the above, I have thought it would be worth while to try, whether a hauling line might not be bent to the grappling, and &s;topped along with the kite rope, and flown along with the kite at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>THE next experiment, for this purpo&s;e, I would propo&s;e to be tried is, how far it is practicable to &s;hoot a grappling with a rope bent to it, la&s;hed along the outer end of a hand&s;pike, &amp;c. made round ju&s;t to fit the bore of a great gun, and long enough to reach from the ring of the grappling clo&s;e to the wad next the powder, with the gun elevated to its hige&s;t range, in order to get a rope from a wreck to the &s;hore. And all the ropes that may be nece&s;&s;ary to be joined together on this occa&s;ion, &s;hould be with long &s;plices to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e be&s;t.</P>
<P>LET it now be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a rope is got from the wreck to the &s;hore, and &s;ecured as well as po&s;&s;ible till &s;ome body can be got on &s;hore by it to &s;ecure it better. To do this, I would propo&s;e to &s;ling in a light but &s;ecure manner to two &s;ingle blocks one at each end of &s;ome of the&s;e things that can be ea&s;ie&s;t come at on board the wreck, &s;uch as a cot, a &s;cuttle ca&s;k, a che&s;t without its lid, a main hatch, or a cabin table, the lower &s;ide up, &amp;c. that a man or two, as the &s;itu|ation and circum&s;tances may admit and require, may be &s;ecured in or
<PB N="206" REF="219">
upon this machine; then reeve the &s;hore rope through the machine block, and to that part of the wreck where it may lead and be hauled tight to the greate&s;t advantage, to &s;upport the machine, running or travelling upon it from the wreck to the &s;hore, in the &s;ure&s;t and be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible; and if the wreck has any lower ma&s;ts &s;tanding, the &s;hore rope leading over the ma&s;t head would mo&s;t likely an&s;wer the purpo&s;e be&s;t, and the top afford a convenient place to get fixed in, and go from, with the machine to the &s;hore. And a hog&s;head, puncheon, or a butt, in my opinion, might be &s;cuttled on each &s;ide of the bung for a machine, that two men might &s;tand facing each other, to great advantage, to haul it on &s;hore, if the &s;ituation re|quired it, or any other thing that the &s;hore rope and tackle may be thought &s;trong enough to bear.</P>
<P>BUT the facility or difficulty attending the&s;e propo&s;als, are in pro|portion to the di&s;tance and height of the &s;hore from the wreck; if the &s;hore is low, and near the wreck, the &s;hore rope may be made to lead the machine upon it with an ea&s;y de&s;cent, from the wreck to the &s;hore, with a man or two in it, without much &s;train either to the rope or grappling on &s;hore; when this is likely to be the ea&s;e, a line &s;hould be made fa&s;t to the machine, to haul it to the wreck again, by which means it may happen that a &s;hip wrecked crew may &s;oon get on &s;hore with ea&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT when the &s;hore happens to be at a great di&s;tance, and much higher than any part of the wreck, this mu&s;t naturally increa&s;e the &s;train on the &s;hore rope and grappling, &amp;c. that holds it, and to the man or men who are to haul the machine on &s;hore by it. Therefore, to endeavour to ca&s;e this &s;train, I would propo&s;e, as it appears to me practicable, to contrive and &s;ix a &s;mall &s;ail to the machine, &s;uch as a hammock or two that has holes ready wrought at each end, a tarpaw|ling, or a piece of &s;ail cut for the purpo&s;e, that may be &s;oon bent or &s;titched with a &s;ail needle and twine to light pieces of wood, one as a yard &s;topped to the head of an upright piece, or two, that may be &s;topped or la&s;hed to the after end of the machine as ma&s;ts, &s;even or eight feet high above it, next the &s;hip, and the foot hauled down to the fore part of the machine next the &s;hore; this &s;ail &s;et to &s;tand in this &s;lanting direction upon the machine that is to run right before the wind in a &s;torm, will certainly help greatly to lift and le&s;&s;en the &s;train of the machine upon the &s;hore rope, and force it forward with
<PB N="207" REF="220">
great power towards the &s;hore. And if, by any &s;uch means as the&s;e, a man or two can be got on &s;hore &s;afe, they may &s;ecure things to the be&s;t advantage; and by hauling lines, &amp;c. may be the means of get|ting all the re&s;t of the people on &s;hore, before the wreck is beat to pieces by the waves.</P>
<P>BUT it may be &s;aid, that the fir&s;t adventurers in the&s;e machines run a great ri&s;k, which mu&s;t be allowed, but de&s;perate &s;ituations re|quire de&s;perate proceedings; when delays are dangerous, if this is the only method that appears to give a chance to &s;ave life, the fir&s;t adven|turers &s;tand the be&s;t chance if they &s;ucceed in getting on &s;hore &s;afe, when every minute the wreck may be liable to be beat to pieces, and all left on board mo&s;t likely to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>NOW let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that there is neither tide nor current to hinder any floating things being drove right on &s;hore from the wreck, by the force of the wind and waves. Then a towline, or other &s;uitable rope, with a hauling line, &amp;c. may be made fa&s;t about the middle of a &s;par, ma&s;t, or yard, &amp;c. and veered away on &s;hore as far as it will go; and if it happens to be an uneven rocky &s;hore, it may chance to fix it&s;elf fa&s;t among&s;t the rocks, by which I have heard a &s;hip's crew got on &s;hore, when they had almo&s;t given them|&s;elves up for lo&s;t. But if it is a &s;andy or gravelly &s;hore, then no &s;uch chance can be expected; it will then require &s;ome people on &s;hore to haul it up, and put it under the &s;and or gravel, its broad &s;ide to the wreck, (as de&s;cribed in page 74 on mooring &s;hips) to make it bear the &s;train that is nece&s;&s;ary for the rope to be tight enough for the machine, as above-mentioned, to travel upon from the wreck to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>NOW let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a &s;et of good people appear upon the &s;hore, for the noble purpo&s;e of doing all in their power, to &s;ave the lives of tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people on board wrecks, to &s;ucceed therein, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the people on &s;hore &s;hould be made to under&s;tand &s;omething of the de&s;igned methods of proceeding. There|fore the be&s;t and approved methods that experiments may produce, &s;hould be repre&s;ented and de&s;cribed in prints, for the purpo&s;e of be|ing di&s;tributed among&s;t our &s;hips,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certain re|wards for poor people &s;aving lives recom|mended.</NOTE> and among&s;t the inhabitants along our &s;ea coa&s;ts, to be made as public as po&s;&s;ible, and rewards of a guinea certain &s;hould be allowed to the poor people on &s;hore for every hu|man

life &s;aved by them from wrecks, and ve&s;&s;els forced on &s;hore, and <HI>Liverpool</HI> leads the way for this noble purpo&s;e; and in propor|tion to the danger and trouble, they are to be rewarded with more than a guinea as thought by a Committee they de&s;erve; which encou|ragement may likewi&s;e be the means of &s;aving their own lives from the ju&s;t laws of our country, by preventing their cruelty, for the &s;ake of plunder, on the&s;e occa&s;ions. And might encourage them to ob|&s;erve and join heartily in whatever methods they perceive the people on board the wreck take to &s;ave them&s;elves, and to help them in it, by &s;ecuring the &s;hore rope, or u&s;ing the hauling line to haul the ma|chine on &s;hore if it is high above the wreck, or made fa&s;t to a raft as the circum&s;tances and &s;ituation may require.

The&s;e may be renewed, but they are of little purpo&s;e with|out good crews to navigate them; and the difficulty we now meet with, in manning both &s;hips of war and merchants &s;hips, &s;hould teach us to u&s;e every method to pre&s;erve the lives of our brave &s;eamen, tho&s;e &s;upporters of our glory, power, wealth, and con&s;equence as a nation; &mdash;they dare the raging tempe&s;t chearfully, and the dreadful &s;laughter from thundering cannon, does not di&s;may them; therefore, how plea&s;ing mu&s;t the thought and reflection be to all that contribute to help and &s;ave them.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, I &s;hall beg leave to propo&s;e one farther con&s;ideration to the &s;erious attention of my Brother Sailors, however un&s;uitable it may appear to a &s;ubject of this kind, or to the profe&s;&s;ion and qualifications of the Writer. I could wi&s;h to impre&s;s upon their minds a deep conviction of this great truth, that our own utmo&s;t &s;kill, caution, vigilance, and dexterity, are altogether in&s;uffi|cient of them&s;elves to command &s;ucce&s;s in our proceedings, or pre|&s;erve us from the many dangers and difficulties we are expo&s;ed to, without HIS all-powerful protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, whom the winds and waves obey.&mdash;<HI>Unle&s;s the Lord keep the Hou&s;e or Ship, the Watchman waketh but in vain.</HI>&mdash;It is the Almighty, author of na|ture alone, who form'd the univer&s;e, and is pre&s;ent to all the parts of it, urging or re&s;training the elements,&mdash;promoting or ob&s;tructing the de&s;igns of men according to the all-wi&s;e and beneficent purpo&s;es of his Government, upon whom our &s;ucce&s;s, happine&s;s and pre&s;erva|tion entirely depend.</P>
<P>HOW diligently then &s;hould we &s;tudy and endeavour, by the u&s;e|fulne&s;s and piety of our lives, to recommend our&s;elves to his favour and protection, and religiou&s;ly implore his direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in all our undertakings;&mdash;knowing him to be our only <HI>&s;ure guide,</HI> our only <HI>certain help</HI> in trouble.</P>
<P>AND we may be likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured, that it is this per&s;ua&s;ion alone, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having endeavoured to regulate our lives ac|cording to his divine Will, that can afford rational happine&s;s in the mo&s;t pro&s;perous circum&s;tances, or in&s;pire us with true courage in dan|gers and difficulties.</P>
<P>THE virtuous and religous man, con&s;iding in his GOD, will, when his duty calls, face Death it&s;elf undi&s;mayed, having nothing to fear, but much to hope from it;&mdash;whil&s;t the impious and wicked upon the fir&s;t appearance of danger are often &s;truck with &s;uch panies, as
<PB N="210" REF="223">
incapacitate them for acting properly for their own &s;afety, or that of others, which may unfortunately depend upon their courage and conduct.</P>
<P>IT would be needle&s;s to enumerate in confirmation of this truth the examples, with which hi&s;tory both ancient and modern abounds, as almo&s;t every one's own experience will abundantly &s;upply them.&mdash; Indeed in the &s;eafaring life they occur but too frequently, and af|ford us convincing evidence of the truth of tho&s;e texts of &s;cripture, <Q><HI>that</HI> there is no peace to the wicked, who are like the troubled &s;ea, which cannot re&s;t;&mdash;that they flee, when no man pur&s;ueth,&mdash;while the righteous are bold as a lion.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The mo&s;t &s;triking proof I ever met with of this was in a tyrannical, impious, &s;elf-&s;ufficient Commander of a &s;hip in the <HI>Jamaica</HI> trade, under whom I &s;ailed; who openly made a mock of all religion, profe&s;&s;ing in his conver&s;ation, that he was under no concern about it, that with a con&s;cience (as he term'd it) void of offence, a man might make him&s;elf very ea&s;y, and the like. But &s;o far was he from this happy &s;tate, that to extingui&s;h thought and reflection he was almo&s;t con&s;tantly adding more guilt to his painful and trou|bled mind, which made him vi&s;ibly a Hell to him&s;elf, and the &s;hip like a Hell a float to all on board under his command; &s;pending his time at &s;ea mo&s;tly in exce&s;&s;ive drinking, gaming, quarrelling, abu&s;ing, and ill-u&s;ing &s;ome part of his crew, even to breaking limbs, and endangering their lives. At the fir&s;t of the voyage officers that refu&s;ed to join him in his follies were called mean &s;pirited fellows, &amp;c. and ordered up to the ma&s;t-head in rainy weather, for a puni&s;hment, to look out during his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>He would damn an officer, and a&s;k why he did not give the &s;eamen &s;ugar plumbs, only for calling them by their proper names. He deemed it an act of piracy for the officer of the watch to offer to lower or take in &s;ail, or bear away from the cour&s;e in heavy &s;qualls of wind, though in the open ocean, and nece&s;&s;ity might require it for the &s;afety of the whole; but he mu&s;t be called upon deck to take the command, and being commonly pot-valiant rather than be obliged, to lower or take in &s;ail, in &s;qualls upon a wind, would cun and run the &s;hip right before the wind, and carry &s;ail till &s;he was &s;o over pre&s;&s;ed, as to lo&s;e the power of the helm to command her.</P>
<P>Thus this over-bearing &s;elf-&s;ufficient Hero thought to outbrave all the power of &s;torms, difficulties, and dangers, without damage; but it proved otherwi&s;e, for we met with &s;uch and &s;o many di&s;a&s;ters, that once the general outcry of the &s;eamen was to out boats and quit the &s;hip; when this boa&s;ting Hero was de&s;ired to exert his authority to &s;top the people from it, he then, tyrant like, lo&s;t all his boa&s;ted courage, fell a crying like a child, and begged his officers to take the command and &s;top the &s;eamen's proceedings, which ju&s;t &s;aved the &s;hip, but not without great damage.</P>
<P>We were well armed for war again&s;t the declared enemies of our country, but our com|mander had the wor&s;t of enemies, a guilty con&s;cience, within him&s;elf; for when quarreling with one part of his officers, the others were called up from &s;leep in the night, to get the &s;mall arms fited off and &s;ecured, to prevent, as he &s;aid, the &s;hip being taken from him.</P>
<P>It would be too much to relate the many great troubles this unhappy man brought upon him&s;elf in this voyage; and the next was his la&s;t, for they were never heard of after de|parting from home.&mdash;I have been more prolix upon this mi&s;erable character, that it may be a warning to others, who wi&s;h for &s;ucce&s;s and happine&s;s, not to follow his example</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="224">BUT though our pre&s;ent as well as future &s;afety and happine&s;s &s;o much depend upon a good and holy life, yet &s;uch is our de&s;perate and amazing depravity, that in&s;tead of rendering due honour and adoration to the Divine Being for his manifold gracious deliverances; &mdash;in&s;tead of invoking his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in dangers and difficulties, how often do we ungratefully bla&s;pheme his all-&s;acred name by profane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing.</P>
<P>HOW &s;trange is it that Sailors, who&s;e pre&s;ervation &s;o vi&s;ibly de|pends upon the providential care, which they almo&s;t daily experience, &mdash;who are, as it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, but an inch breadth from eter|nity;&mdash;that they, more than any other cla&s;s of men, &s;hould be almo&s;t perpetually daring the Divine vengeance by this mo&s;t unaccountable vice! A vice of all others the mo&s;t irrational, which can offer neither plea&s;ure nor profit to tempt us to the commi&s;&s;ion of it, nor urge in its vindication, what &s;ome other vices may, a natural propen&s;ity: For no man, as Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, can plead that he was born with a &s;wearing con&s;titution.</P>
<P>OFFICERS &s;ometimes ju&s;tify this wicked practice under a pretence that their orders would not be &s;ufficiently regarded, unle&s;s enforced by &s;wearing.&mdash;Idle and vain pretence! as upon trying a different conduct, I am per&s;uaded, they will be &s;oon convinced.&mdash;From my own ob&s;ervation and experience I can a&s;&s;ert, that in critical emer|gencies, when the lea&s;t delay would be fatal to the whole, and nece&s;|&s;ity requires every one to exert his utmo&s;t, any &s;ort of &s;harp words or threats uttered with an angry tone,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calling the unactive lubbers, and the like.</NOTE> telling the men the nece&s;&s;ity for their activity, and how much depends upon it, will have a better effect than vulgar oaths, which from being &s;o frequently heard be|come no more regarded by them than common words;&mdash;they having from example and daily practice learned to &s;wear, as profanely as their officers.</P>
<P>THE &s;hameful prevalence of this vice among&s;t us and the infec|tious influence of ill example are but too evidently &s;een from this, that the inferior &s;ort of foreigners, who have much conver&s;ation with us, generally acquire this common &s;wearing part of our language fir&s;t: &mdash;A melancholy proof that they hear it mo&s;t frequently,&mdash;and are perhaps mo&s;t inclined to imitate it.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="225">HOW highly incumbent then is it upon officers and tho&s;e in com|mand always to di&s;countenance this vicious practice by their own example; as no reformation without this can be expected;&mdash;e&s;pecially if they reflect that the more exalted a man's &s;tation is, the greater is his crime; as its influence is more pernicious:&mdash;And &s;ince <HI>many a fruitful and flouri&s;hing land has been made barren for the wickedne&s;s of its inhabitants,</HI> every impious and profane man ought to be deemed and treated as the greate&s;t enemy to his country.</P>
<P>BUT I indulge the plea&s;ing hope, that a reformation will now be &s;oon produced by the virtues of our pre&s;ent mo&s;t amiable Sovereign, in who&s;e bright example we &s;ee piety, morality, and obedience to the laws of God and his country &s;trongly recommended.&mdash;And I would hope, that his wi&s;hes expre&s;&s;ed in his fir&s;t mo&s;t excellent Proclama|tion, are not only publicly read in all his navy, as often as the arti|cles of war, but al&s;o enforced, to check the immorality and profane|ne&s;s, which has too long prevailed among&s;t &s;eamen of all ranks and degrees.</P>
<P>And in order to promote this good end, which every one, who has the intere&s;t of his country at heart, will endeavour as much as lies in his power, I would earne&s;tly recommend it to all Commanders of &s;hips to have a rea&s;onable part of Divine Wor&s;hip publicly per|formed on board every day, or as often as conveniently may be;&mdash; which, to our &s;hame be it &s;poken, is often, even in our large <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the fir&s;t fifteen years that I was at &s;ea, in different trades, I never &s;aw any religious duty publicly performed on board, except that in an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> &s;hip, for two or three <HI>Sun|days,</HI> when we drew near the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> we had prayers, which cea&s;ed after we pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Cape.</HI>&mdash;Does not this indicate that the fear of approaching danger was the mo|tive, and not a grateful &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e ince&s;&s;ant benefits, we are con&s;tantly receiving?&mdash; Indeed that great Company, or their Managers, are highly blamable in &s;hamefully rating tho&s;e large &s;hips only at 499 tons, in order to evade the expence of a Clergyman, and the penalty of the Law for not carrying one.&mdash;It would be well for them to con&s;ider, that acting upon chri&s;tian principles is the only true policy; and that &s;chemes upon any other principles, cunningly devi&s;ed, for the accumulation of wealth, may, and mo&s;t likely will in the event, prove unto them only an occa&s;ion of falling.</NOTE> <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> &s;hips, &s;candalou&s;ly neglected.</P>
<P>THIS, I think, I can &s;ay from profitable experience, contri|butes greatly to produce good order, harmony, and piety on board, and check di&s;order, vice and immorality of every kind,&mdash;even a|mong&s;t
<PB N="213" REF="226">
the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute and ignorant in privateers, as well as mer|chant &s;hips.</P>
<P>NO rational Being &s;urely can want exhortation to this mo&s;t rea&s;on|able and bounden duty:&mdash;For <HI>man,</HI> the only animal in the creation, &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hingly favoured,&mdash; endowed with faculties to contemplate the glorious works of the creation, and enjoy his portion of the good things thereof with gratitude to the great Creator, and benevolence to his fellow-creatures,&mdash;for <HI>man,</HI> I &s;ay, to want piety and religious ve|neration is wor&s;e than bruti&s;h.&mdash;For <HI>man,</HI> ble&s;&s;ed with the lights of the Go&s;pel to direct him in his duty, to reform, improve and qua|lify his nature for higher enjoyments,&mdash;pointing out to him, what is mo&s;t conducive both to his pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s, to renounce the&s;e high privileges, and blindly wallow in &s;en&s;uality&mdash;is truly mon|&s;trous.</P>
<P>BUT after all,&mdash;though our religion lays no re&s;traints upon us, but &s;uch only as promote our pre&s;ent happine&s;s, both as individuals and members of &s;ociety,&mdash;yet &s;uch is our mi&s;erable frailty, and &s;o many, various and powerful are the enemies and temptations we have to contend with in our cour&s;e, that of our&s;elves, as we have deplorable conviction from daily experience, we cannot but fall.</P>
<P>WITH what humble gratitude then, what ardor of affection and adoration &s;hould we embrace the <HI>great Salvation</HI> revealed in the Go&s;pel, procured and purcha&s;ed for us at &s;o dear a price and in &s;o my&s;terious and &s;tupendous a manner!&mdash;and <HI>freely</HI> offered us, &s;o much in need, and &s;o wholly unworthy of it! What <HI>ailigence</HI> &s;hould we u&s;e,&mdash;what holine&s;s of life &s;hould we a&s;pire after, to en&s;ure to our&s;elves an in|tere&s;t in this grand ATTONING SACRIFICE! And how devoutly &s;hould we implore the promi&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>his aiding and &s;anctifying grace</HI> to conduct us &s;afe through this tran&s;itory voyage of life, to a ble&s;&s;ed and happy eternity.</P>
<P>LET us then, under the direction and guidance of this great AUTHOR and CAPTAIN of our SALVATION, our all-glorious REDEEMER, CHRIST JESUS, pur&s;ue our cour&s;e with &s;teadine&s;s and re&s;olution, and fight manfully under his banner,&mdash;looking upon him for &s;uccour in all our di&s;tre&s;&s;es and difficulties, who is all-powerful in Heaven and Earth, and will never for&s;ake or reject tho&s;e, who &s;in|cerely love and tru&s;t in him.&mdash;To whom be Glory for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
