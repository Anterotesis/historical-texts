<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IN the following little Treati&s;e, intended for the U&s;e of Children, the Author has endeavoured to &s;et down his Meaning ju&s;t as he would explain it by Word of Mouth, to a young Per&s;on an intire &s;tranger to Mu&s;ick, enlarging and more minutely expre&s;&s;ing many Things, which, to Per&s;ons of maturer Judg|ment might have been explained in fewer Words. It is hoped, therefore, that the critical Reader will not take Exception to the Imperfections of Style, or Tau|tology that may have been occa&s;ioned by this Method of treating the Subject. If in other Re&s;pects it &s;hall be found to an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e of In&s;truction, this is all that is aimed at.</P>
<P>The Author, however, that he may not &s;eem to make much ado about no|thing, begs leave to a&s;&s;ure his Readers, that, in&s;ignificant as his Method of hit|ting Di&s;tances may appear to &s;ome, it has neverthele&s;s been practi&s;ed, by &s;everal Per&s;ons, with great Succe&s;s. He therefore flatters him&s;elf, that the young Per|&s;ons, for who&s;e U&s;e the following Rules were drawn up, will not e&s;teem them unworthy their Con&s;ideration, e&s;pecially when they &s;hall find that this Method of learning Mu&s;ick requires very little Time in Compari&s;on of the old Method of Sol fa-ing.</P>
<P>It is not alledged or pretended that a Child may comprehend the&s;e Rules of him&s;elf without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome under&s;tanding Per&s;on, who, by reading them over with him, &s;hall teach him how to apply them&mdash;neither does he &s;ay that they are &s;ufficient to make a &s;kilful Mu&s;ician; nor does he recommend them to &s;uch Children as are bred Mu&s;icians by Profe&s;&s;ion; but to &s;uch only as cannot be allowed Time enough from their other School Studies to learn Mu&s;ick in the regular Way, but yet may be enabled in a little Time, by this Method, to bear a CHORUS PART in the Service of God.</P>

Before I can give the Learner an Example of this Rule, he mu&s;t be well ac|quainted with the Nature of the Cliffs; which, from their Situation on the Be|ginning of a Line, readily determine the Name of each Note. For Example:</P>
<P>Whatever Line in a Stave &s;hall have the C Cliff marked upon it, at the Be|ginning, mu&s;t be called C, and all the other Lines and Spaces mu&s;t take their Names from it, ri&s;ing in alphabetical Order. The &s;ame Method mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved in the other Cliffs.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>RULE VI.</HEAD>
<P>There are but 3 Cliffs in Mu&s;ick, Viz.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The G Cliff, commonly called the Treble Cliff, and marked <GAP DESC="music"> which &s;eems to owe its Shape to a carele&s;s Manner of making a G, as it is &s;ometimes marked <GAP DESC="music"> for G &s;ol re ut. It is &s;eldom placed on any other Line but the Second, and is u&s;ed in the uppermo&s;t or Treble Part of mo&s;t Compo&s;itions, viz. the Part for Women's or Boy's Voices, and Treble In&s;truments.</P>
<P>Secondly the C Cliff marked <GAP DESC="music">. It is called Tenor, Contratenor, or Soprano Cliff, according to the Line on which it is placed; which Line (being made C by the Cliff) is in the &s;ame Octave with the lowe&s;t C in the G Cliff marked <GAP DESC="music"> but this will be more ea&s;ily under&s;tood by examining the Scale which follows the next Paragraph.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The F Cliff, marked <GAP DESC="music"> or <GAP DESC="music"> commonly called the Ba&s;s Cliff, be|cau&s;e it is much lower in Pitch than the re&s;t, making the 4th Line (on which it is u&s;ually placed) one Octave below the lowe&s;t F in the Treble Cliff marked <GAP DESC="music"> notwith&s;tanding which the young Scholar, in practi&s;ing the following Exam|ples, may &s;ing in the natural Pitch of his Treble Voice, taking his Key Note as it &s;hall be&s;t &s;uit him&s;elf; for the only Rea&s;on of prefixing the F Cliff to the follow|ing Examples is, that the Learner, by being &s;ufficiently acquainted with it, may the more readily find the Key Note in real Compo&s;itions.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">A <HI>SCALE</HI> &s;hewing the different <HI>OCTAVES</HI> of the <HI>3 CLIFFS.</HI></P>

<HEAD>RULE VII.</HEAD>
<P>In mo&s;t mu&s;ical Compo&s;itions the la&s;t Note in the Ba&s;s is the Key Note.</P>
<P>That the young Scholar may more readily find the Name of this Note in the following Scale (as it is &s;omewhat aukward to &s;ay the Letters backward from the Cliff Line) let him find the 4th Space below the Line on which the F Cliff is placed, which is &s;till F, though an Octave, or the 8th Note lower; then let him count forwards G, A, B, and the next Note, C, he finds to be the Key Note; as for Example. <GAP DESC="music"> the Key Note in the following Example.</P>
<P>A Scale of <HI>8</HI> Notes, gradually a&s;cending and de&s;cending.
<GAP DESC="music"></P>
<P>Having found the Key Note to be C, refer back to the 5th Rule to find where the Half Notes lie, proceeding from the Key Note, as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>From C to D is a Whole Tone.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From D to E is a Whole Tone.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From E to F is a Half Tone. N. B. Between the 3d and 4th commonly called the 4th Place.</ITEM>

<ITEM>From A to B is a Whole Tone.</ITEM>
<ITEM>B to C is but Half a Tone. N. B. Between the 7th and 8th commonly called the 8th Place.</ITEM>

This, according to the 3d Rule mu&s;t be a Sharp Key.</P>

<HEAD>RULE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The ea&s;ie&s;t Method of hitting the Di&s;tances is practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who play on the <HI>French</HI> Horn, or Trumpet: for as the Tones from tho&s;e In&s;truments are not form|ed by the Fingering, like others, but only by the Lips and Breath; &s;o the Idea of pa&s;&s;ing from Note to Note mu&s;t be much the &s;ame as in Singing. They com|monly &s;ound the Key-Note of their In&s;trument, and its 3d, 5th, and Octave, backwards and forwards, in tuning, before they begin to play any Piece, and &s;trictly ob&s;erve what Lines or Spaces tho&s;e Notes (the 3d, 5th, and 8th) &s;hould be placed, according to the Cliff they play in; for, as they mu&s;t keep the Sound of their Key Note in Idea, &s;o they readily from thence &s;ound the 3d, 5th, and Octave, having u&s;ed their Ear to tho&s;e Di&s;tances, which, like Steps, convey the Performer to all other Notes of the mu&s;ical Scale. Before the Young Practi|tioner &s;tudies the following Examples, he mu&s;t accu&s;tom him&s;elf (by Ear only, and without Notes) to &s;ound, fir&s;t, the &s;harp 3d, and the 5th, and 8th, and then the flat 3d, and the 5th, and 8th, to any given Note; which any Per&s;on, who has the lea&s;t Knowledge of Mu&s;ick, can teach him, by fir&s;t &s;ounding them for him to imitate. Let him likewi&s;e be u&s;ed to &s;ound the 5th and Octave to any given Note, mi&s;&s;ing the 3d, as <GAP DESC="music"> and to &s;trike Octaves without the intermediate Notes, as <GAP DESC="music"> And if he finds it difficult to hit a 3d, let him &s;uppo&s;e a Note between the given Note and the 3d, as <GAP DESC="music"> To find the Tone of a 7th let him &s;uppo&s;e the Octave before it, as <GAP DESC="music"> To hit a 6th, let him &s;uppo&s;e the 5th fir&s;t, as <GAP DESC="music"> And to find the 4th above the Key, let him touch &s;oftly fir&s;t upon the 5th as <GAP DESC="music"> With &s;ome Practice in this Method, a Per&s;on who has a good Ear for Mu&s;ick, may acquire &s;o clear an Idea of the Di&s;tances, that he will be enabled to &s;ing tolerably at Sight, without tho&s;e la&s;t mentioned A&s;&s;i&s;tances.</P>
<P>In &s;inging the following Examples let the Learner make u&s;e of the Word La to every Note, it being the be&s;t Syllable to form a round open Tone upon.</P>

<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>RULE IX.</HEAD>

<HEAD>RULE X.</HEAD>
<P>A Flat is marked b; every Note having this Mark &s;et before it, or at the Beginning of its Line or Space, is &s;ounded half a Tone lower than it would be without it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">
A Sharp is marked &sharp;, and makes every Note, before which it is &s;et, half a Note or Tone higher.</P>
<P>When any Note (having a b or &sharp; &s;et at the Beginning of its Line or Space) is required by the Melody to be &s;ung as if there was no b or &sharp;, then this Mark &natur; (called a Natural) is placed before it.</P>
<P><HI>Example of the Flat Key.</HI></P>
<P>N. B. The following &s;hort Example is not intended to be &s;ung (for it is not agreeable to the Rules of Modulation to a&s;cend gradually the 4 upper|mo&s;t Notes of a Flat Key) but is merely &s;peculative, to &s;hew the Situ|ation of the Half-Notes. <GAP DESC="music"></P>
<P>Refer to the 5th Rule for the Explanation, which will lie as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>From the Key-Note C to D is a Whole-Tone,</ITEM>
<ITEM>and from D to E is a Whole-Tone,</ITEM>
<ITEM>but from D to E b is but Half a Tone, for the b, marked at the Be|ginning of the Space, makes E Half a Tone lower, and con&s;equently Half a Tone near D. N. B. This Half-Note is between the 2d and 3d commonly called the 3d Place.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Then from E b to F mu&s;t be a Whole-Tone, becau&s;e, from E, without the b, to F, according to the 5th Rule, is an Half-Tone.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From F to G is a Whole-Tone, and</ITEM>
<ITEM>from G to A is a Whole-Tone, but from G to A b (the b be|ing marked on the Space of the Octave below) is but Half a Tone. N. B. This is between the 5th and 6th, called the 6th Place.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Then from A b to B b is a whole Tone, for as they both have a Flat (A on the Space, and B on the Line of their Octaves below) &s;o are they both brought an Half-Tone lower, and con&s;equently are &s;till the &s;ame Di&s;tance from each other, which the 5th Rule mentions. Then from B b to C is a Whole-Tone, the B being made Half a Tone further from C by the b; this therefore, according to the 4th Rule, mu&s;t be a Flat Key, having one Half-Note between the 2d and 3d, and the other between the 5th and 6th.</P>
<P>Let the Learner be very careful to &s;ound the 7th a Whole-Tone below the Octave; for, after &s;inging in a Sharp Key, he will be very liable to make it only Half a Note lower.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">
<HI>Examples in the &s;ame Key.</HI> <GAP DESC="music"></P>
<P><HI>Example in</HI> D, <HI>with a Sharp Third.</HI> <GAP DESC="music"></P>
<P>Refer to the 5th Rule beginning with D, as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>From D to E is a Whole-Tone?</ITEM>
<ITEM>From E to F is Half a Tone, but to F &sharp; (the &sharp; placed at the Beginning of the Line, making it Half a Tone higher) is a Whole-Tone.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From F &sharp; to G is Half a Tone, becau&s;e F is brought Half a Tone nearer to G, by the &sharp; placed at the Beginning of the Line.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From G to A is a Whole-Tone.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From A to B is a Whole-Tone.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From B to C is Half a Tone, but a &sharp; being placed on the Space of the Octave below makes C Half a Tone higher, &s;o it is con&s;e|quently a Whole-Note from B to C &sharp;.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From C &sharp; to D is Half a Tone, C being made Half a Note higher, and nearer D by the &sharp;; &s;o that, as this Half-Tone is between the 7th and 8th, and the other between the 3d and 4th, it mu&s;t be a Sharp Key, according to the 3d Rule.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11">
<HI>Example in</HI> B <HI>Flat Key.</HI> <GAP DESC="music"></P>
<P>Refer again to the 5th Rule, beginning with the Key-Note B, as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>From B to C is Half a Tone, but from B to C &sharp; is a Whole-Tone.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From C &sharp; to D can be but Half a Tone, becau&s;e from C Natural to D is a Whole-Tone.<NOTE>N. B. Between the 2d and 3d.</NOTE></ITEM>
<ITEM>From D to E is a Whole-Tone.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From E to F &sharp; is a Whole-Tone, the &sharp; removing F Half a Tone higher and further from E.</ITEM>
<ITEM>From F &sharp; to G is but Half a Tone, the &sharp; removing F Half a Note higher, and nearer to G. <NOTE>N. B. Between the 5th and 6th.</NOTE></ITEM>
<ITEM>From G to A is a Whole-Tone; and</ITEM>
<ITEM>from A to B is a Whole-Tone: therefore this Example, according to the 4th Rule, mu&s;t be a Flat Key, having one Half-Tone between the 2d and 3d, and the other between the 5th and 6th.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In the &s;ame Manner are all other Keys to be proved, the Key-Note being found by the 7th Rule.</P>
<P>The next Thing to be con&s;idered is TIME, or the Length of Notes, which the following Table will &s;hew.</P>
<P>A Semibreve &notesemibreve; is as long as <GAP DESC="music"> Minims, which are as long as <GAP DESC="music"> Crotchets, which are as long as <GAP DESC="music"> Quavers, which are as long as 16 <GAP DESC="music"> Semiquavers.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12">
Every Piece of Mu&s;ick, having 4 Crotchets in a Bar, is &s;aid to be in COMMON-TIME, and has generally this Mark C put at the Beginning of the Stave.</P>
<P>thus <GAP DESC="music"></P>
<P>For the more exact keeping of this Mea&s;ure, it is u&s;ual to beat with the Hand at the Beginning of every Bar, and to keep it down during one Half of the Bar; viz. while you count 1 and 2, and to hold it up while you count 3 and 4, the remaining Half of the Bar.</P>
<P>When a Piece of Mu&s;ick has 3 Crotchets in a Bar, it is then called triple Time, and is marked at the Beginning of a Stave <GAP DESC="music"></P>
<P>In beating of this Time, you mu&s;t count the 2 fir&s;t Crotchets with your Hand down, and the 3d with your Hand up.</P>
<P>The next material Thing to be con&s;idered in vocal Mu&s;ick, is the &s;peaking of the Words di&s;tinct and plain; which alone, and not the Singing quick (a fal&s;e Notion which too much prevails in Choir Mu&s;ick) can add Spirit to the Per|formance; but this, if the Student's own Genius does not direct him, mu&s;t be taught by a good Ma&s;ter, as it cannot &s;o ea&s;ily be explained in Writing.</P>
<P>To conclude, I mu&s;t advi&s;e the Learner to choo&s;e the ea&s;ie&s;t and &s;lowe&s;t Com|po&s;itions to begin his Practice with, &s;uch as common P&s;alm Tunes, and other &s;low Movements.</P>
<P>A further and compleat Under&s;tanding of vocal Mu&s;ick, can only be acquired by being long conver&s;ant in the Science.</P>
