<HEAD>PREFACE To the READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on an Apology, why I trouble the Sweating Pre&s;s, tho I might u&s;e and plead the common Topicks taken from the Advice and Impor|tunity of others, and to prevent the Publi&s;hing of &s;ome of the&s;e Remarks, excerpt from my Papers, by &s;ome, into who&s;e hands, they had fallen, after they had lien by me &s;everal Months.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Grave Per&s;ons in the&s;e I&s;les of good and &s;olid Judgment, both Mini&s;ters and Others, who being better acquainted with the Places of their ordinary Re&s;idence, then it can be &s;uppo&s;ed I had occa&s;ion to be, might have Publi&s;hed &s;ome|thing more Valuable on this Head, and &s;et their Remarks in a clearer Light. As likewi&s;e &s;ome of my Dear Brethren of the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> might have done it to greater Advantage. Yet the En|gagements that lay on me, to Tran&s;cribe the mo&s;t Remarkable Occurrences, and the Solicitation of &s;ome thereupon, to Publi&s;h them, have &s;ome way obliged me to make this Appearance. However if others
<PB REF="9">
hereby &s;hall be excited to &s;erve the Publick, by giv|ing a fuller and clearer <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of the&s;e Gener|ally little known Places, this E&s;&s;ay will not prove al|together unu&s;eful. And if I had known that any in|tended to have Publi&s;hed &s;omething of this nature, the World had not been troubled with my Scribling.</P>
<P>I hope none will judge, that I Act without my Line, in giving De&s;criptions of this Nature, &s;ee|ing all are called to <HI>Remember the Works of the Lord and Talk of His Doings,</HI> as they have occa&s;ion: And all along, I endeavour to keep in mind the Character I bear, dropping &s;omething of a Spiritual Improvement.</P>
<P>Our Historians, &s;uch as I have con&s;ulted, have given but a very brief and lame, and in &s;ome things a fal&s;e Account of the&s;e places, e&s;pecially <HI>Zetland,</HI> which is unknown to the mo&s;t of the Nation, if not that they have only heard, there were &s;uch I&s;les, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Zetlandick.</HI> It is true, there is one Mr&punc; <HI>Wallace</HI> a late Mini&s;ter in <HI>Orkney,</HI> who hath gratified the World, by giving a De&s;cription, of the <HI>Orkney-I&s;les;</HI> But neither <HI>Zetland</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Caithne&s;s</HI> doth he meddle with: And as to <HI>Ork|ney,</HI> there are &s;everal things which de&s;erve their own Remark, he makes no mention of; And others have fallen out &s;ince his time, which I have noticed So that, on the whole, the Account now given even of <HI>Orkney,</HI> will appear almo&s;t new to any, who &s;hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be plea&s;ed to compare the two De&s;criptions together.</P>
<P>No doubt but &s;uch as know the&s;e Places, will de|&s;iderate &s;everal things no le&s;s Remarkable, then wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are Ob&s;erved; But &s;till my Reader would remem|ber, That this is but a Diary Tran&s;cribed.

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e the judicious Reader in peru&s;ing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ollowing &s;heets, will find things borh Curious and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;tructive, affording matter of Meditation to the Wi&s;e Ob&s;ervers of Providence.</P>

<P>Altho the Style be not Quaint and Elegant, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbelli&s;hd with the Ornaments of Art; yet I hope it will be found plain and intelligible; and tho &s;ometimes obliged to expre&s;s my &s;elf in the Dialect or Idioti&s;m of the Countrey, yet ordinarily &s;uch Words and Phra&s;es are &s;ome way explained. So when I &s;peak of <HI>Orkney</HI> or <HI>Zetland,</HI> as not in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho depending thereupon, I expre&s;s my &s;elf, as the Countrey do.</P>
<P>As to the Commi&s;&s;ions Work I have not meddled therewith, except when the threed of the Hi&s;tory did require me to touch it. However this I may add, Our weak endeavours, for the Advance|ment of the Intere&s;t of Our <HI>LORD JESUS,</HI> in the&s;e remote Corners, have not been found, by Su|periour Judicatories, altogether un&s;ucce&s;sful; And, I &s;uppo&s;e, it repents none of us, of our Voyage thi|ther; however dangerous it did prove.</P>
