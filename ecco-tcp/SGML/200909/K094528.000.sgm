<HEAD>THE HERMITAGE.</HEAD>
<P>POSSESSED of an ancient family e&s;tate, Periander dwelt in a village, exerci&s;ing tho&s;e virtues, which render a man happy in him|&s;elf, and a ble&s;&s;ing to his fellow creatures.</P>
<P>PROVIDENCE had made him the father of an only &s;on, who&s;e excel|lencies at once indulged the warm|e&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="4">of his parental wi&s;hes, and pro|mi&s;ed to the world a happy &s;ucce&s;|&s;or to Periander, who&s;e grey hairs approached the grave.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t ve&s;tiges of the Refor|mation had not taken place in this kingdom; yet Periander, from a mind enlarged with learning and benevolence, had embraced certain principles di&s;&s;enting from the Ro|mi&s;h church.</P>
<P>IN the neighbourhood of the vil|lage &s;tood a mona&s;tery, the chief of
<PB N="5" REF="5">which an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who, from the contracted habits of his education, had hardened his &s;oul with every &s;everity of &s;uper&s;tition. His meagre tall figure, was made lean by a mind of anxiety, and his pale vi&s;age and hollow eyes, expre&s;&s;ed avarice and envy. He had acquired a bi|gotry of principle, from example rather than judgement; his mona|&s;tic learning not advancing his cha|rity, had furni&s;hed him with cen|&s;ures and condemnations; and his aver&s;ions were more generally ex|erci&s;ed than his compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6">ARBITRARY in his principles, &s;o was Father Peter arbitrary in his manners. The in&s;olence of the church enflamed his bo&s;om, and zeal for peculiar modes extingui&s;h|ed that e&s;&s;ence of religion, univer&s;al love. To depart from Father Pe|ter's precepts, was to &s;in without mea&s;ure; and, amid&s;t a thou&s;and good actions, and a life of uninter|rupted benevolence, Periander ac|quired the hatred and enmity of the gho&s;tly Father.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">FATHER Peter, who, from his holy office, might be conceived to be an imitator of the God whom he &s;erved; who&s;e life, being totally ab|&s;tracted from the cares of the world, was &s;u&s;tained in luxury by the hands of the labourer; who&s;e reli|gious zeal offering to the Deity through his mini&s;ters, &s;tored the cloi&s;ter with the tenths of all his fruits; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of abundant lei&s;ure to indulge his &s;tudy of the Divinity through all his works; might we not have hoped, that &s;uch a man would have armed him&s;elf again&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="8">the powers of &s;atan, and have go|verned the impetuous ardour of human pa&s;&s;ions, correcting them with true religion: But &s;o far from modulating the &s;allies of the &s;oul with piety and virtue, wrath and per&s;ecution were the weapons which were wielded by his con&s;ecrated hands.</P>
<P>THE influence which the reli|gious had over families, their &s;ecret intercour&s;e, and the rigorous mode in which they &s;u&s;tained their arbi|trary authority, gave Father Peter
<PB N="9" REF="9">many opportunities of in&s;tigating mi&s;chief on his neighbour. His blind bigotry induced him to think, that, in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing one who di&s;&s;ented from the church of Rome, he ren|dered e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the God of all; through zealous frenzy he de|vi&s;ed a thou&s;and treacheries, and a thou&s;and &s;nares to oppre&s;s and in|jure Periander.</P>
<P>THE Seigniory was Lord Melvil's, where Periander's lands lay; he held them by Knight's &s;ervice. To this Lord, the treacherous prie&s;t addre&s;s'd
<PB N="10" REF="10">him&s;elf; and, from a forged in&s;tru|ment, alledged to be recorded a|mong&s;t the rolls and legends of the mona&s;tery of St Benedict, he indu|ced him to pro&s;ecute a claim to the e&s;tates of Periander. The &s;ecret engines from mona&s;tic emi&s;&s;aries were &s;ent abroad; the ignorant, de|luded through their blindne&s;s into zeal, were prepared as witne&s;&s;es to evidence whatever they might be prompted to.</P>
<P>PERIANDER, already enervated with age, his &s;oul untoned, his
<PB N="11" REF="11">judgement relaxed, and his mind &s;moothed into that divine compo|&s;ure, which ble&s;&s;es the good man in his old age, as the harbinger of his di&s;&s;olution; received the&s;e acts of oppre&s;&s;ion without dread: He con|fided in the God of ju&s;tice, and &s;miled at the devices of his enemies: But too late he perceived, that the workers of iniquity were not always corrected by the in&s;tant hand of in|terpo&s;ing Providence. He was at length alarmed with the reality of his danger; his paternal bo&s;om felt apprehen&s;ions for his &s;on; his age
<PB N="12" REF="12">was di&s;turbed in the mid&s;t of its infirmities, and the hand of care gra&s;ped at his fainting &s;oul.</P>
<P>PERIANDER did not long &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock, he &s;unk into the arms of death. With filial devotion, his be|loved &s;on A&s;tianax laid him in the vault amid&s;t his ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>ASTIANAX, called from his travels by his father's approaching fate, an utter &s;tranger to the enmity and &s;tratagems of Father Peter, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his inheritance: The
<PB N="13" REF="13">conte&s;t &s;till went on. Some little time preceding to the day of trial, A&s;tianax had retired into the gallery of his man&s;ion, to meditate on the po&s;ture of his affairs, and to con&s;ider of Lord Melvil's claim. As he walked pen&s;ive to and fro, on a &s;udden, behind him, at the further end of the gallery, he heard a cla&s;h of armour: Turning ha&s;tily, he ob|&s;erved the buckler and &s;hield to &s;hake, which once his great ance&s;tor Norban wore; and in which, in Pale&s;tine, he te&s;tified his valour to the Saracens. He regarded the e|vent
<PB N="14" REF="14">as accidental, and on pur&s;ued his melancholy walk: Hearing the &s;ound again, he looked up, and perceived the coat of mail to trem|ble on the crooks where it hung, and the gauntlet moved as if it beckoned him. This is no common circum&s;tance, cries he, let me di&s;co|ver the occa&s;ion of that trouble in the&s;e arms, which, with their own|er, long have been at re&s;t. He a&s;|cended a few &s;teps, and begun to hand the armour, when he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, within the brea&s;t-plate, a light like the fainting rays which
<PB N="15" REF="15">glow worms &s;hed within the &s;ha|dowy bower at eventide. Advan|cing further, he di&s;covered, that the beams proceeded from a &s;mall onyx cro&s;s, which hung concealed by the armour, &s;u&s;pended in a gol|den chain, from the collar. The unexpected acqui&s;ition threw him, for a moment, into &s;urpri&s;e. Strange it is, thought he, that &s;uch a gem &s;hould remain for &s;even ages undi&s;|covered by his forefathers; a gem &s;o rare, that, in its compo&s;ition, it excelled all he had ever &s;een. It was, as the onyx &s;tone, &s;hadowy,
<PB N="16" REF="16">and round, and variegated; but a|round it was diffu&s;ed a livid light; on its parts were various engravings, of my&s;terious or emblematical cha|racters, appearing like the Egyptian devices, repre&s;enting the attributes of the God of nature. A &s;udden propen&s;ity led A&s;tianax to place the chain upon his neck. Soon as the a|mulet had touched his bo&s;om, from every point of the cro&s;s, there fell warm drops of blood; and, with a horrid clangour, the armour &s;hook in every joint! Surpri&s;e now changed to fear. Have I, &s;ays he, with &s;acri|legious
<PB N="17" REF="17">hands, polluted this fair gem? and is the &s;pirit of the mighty Norban offended at my ra&s;hne&s;s? Again the armour &s;hook! The&s;e un|common appearances encrea&s;ed his amazement; as, if danger was near, he laid his hand upon his &s;word, and, looking around, &s;eemed to ex|pect an enemy. His enemy was there! The in&s;atiable eccle&s;ia&s;tic, not being content with the &s;low pro|gre&s;s of the laws, in the oppre&s;&s;ion of A&s;tianax, and not being appea|&s;ed by the death of the good Pe|riander; but taking advantage of
<PB N="18" REF="18">the liberty which the&s;e times of bi|gotry afforded to the churchmen, he pa&s;t through the apartments of the hou&s;e uninterrupted, and &s;ought the heir of Periander in his retire|ment, to accompli&s;h his infernal pur|po&s;es by his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. The ble&s;&s;|ed &s;pirits of tho&s;e who have left this life, remain our guardian angels; and, till this globe by fire &s;hall be refined into a heaven for men, they hover in the upper atmo&s;phere, where light alone fills the expan&s;e, and ride above the watry vapourous veil which circumvades this planet:
<PB N="19" REF="19">There they behold whate'er betides their kindred &s;ouls on earth: From whence, de&s;cending to our aid, as each emergency advances, far as &s;uch refined beings, &s;pirits of hea|venly mould, can move the dull and drow&s;y &s;en&s;es of our earthly form, they influence our will, or check our wi&s;h, or turn our ra&s;h re&s;olve; by touch &s;o delicate, that we, amid&s;t the in&s;piration, know not how or why we pa&s;s between our purpo&s;e and the event: Their form is al&s;o pure, that, to our &s;ight, the &s;pirits riding on the beams of light, e&s;cape
<PB N="20" REF="20">the &s;en&s;e, like colours, till they pa&s;s on mediums which are attuned to the dullne&s;s of man's nature; &s;o, when they would conduct us from perils eminent, or to the fair po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions of pro&s;perity, they a&s;&s;ume &s;ome form terre&s;trial, to mini&s;ter to us their more peculiar care.</P>
<P>THE approach of Father Peter, at fir&s;t, &s;truck A&s;tianax with appre|hen&s;ion; but, on recollection of his holy office, and of his public name for godline&s;s and rigid virtue, his fear &s;ub&s;ided: Yet, not knowing
<PB N="21" REF="21">why, he &s;till retained his hand upon his &s;word. The gho&s;tly father, in his bo&s;om hid the dagger which he brought to &s;hed A&s;tianax's blood. With a &s;olemn look of &s;anctity, he addre&s;s'd the youth in language culled from all the &s;tore of ba&s;e hy|pocri&s;y, fir&s;t di&s;ciplined in dark mona&s;tic &s;chools. With &s;eeming tears he &s;poke of Periander; and, cro&s;&s;ing his brea&s;t, prayed for his departed &s;pirit. He &s;ighed, and talked of all the ance&s;try of young A&s;tianax, and called on &s;aints to lead him in the paths of his forefathers.
<PB N="22" REF="22">Forth he &s;tretched his hand to ble&s;s him; and from his &s;word the un|&s;u&s;picious youth was ready to with|draw, to cla&s;p the monk within his bo&s;om, where his &s;oul rebounded with the fervour of his reverence and love to tho&s;e of whom he &s;poke. In that in&s;tant the armour &s;hook! Alarmed by the repeated &s;ound, A&s;tianax &s;tepped back! The noi&s;e had touched the eccle&s;ia&s;tic's ear; and, with emotions not to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed, he felt unu&s;ual terrors &s;eize his &s;oul! The crucifix upon the bo&s;om of A&s;tianax again let fall fre&s;h
<PB N="23" REF="23">tears of blood; and, fixed with ear|ne&s;t and involuntary gra&s;p, his hand remained upon his &s;word. Various pa&s;&s;ions wandered on his features. The monk long u&s;ed to look upon the face of tho&s;e he dealt with, there to di&s;cover, from that undeceiving index, the &s;entiments which agitate the &s;oul, fixed a &s;teady gaze upon the youth, wondering to behold a lu&s;tre beam o'er all his a&s;pect, &s;uch as zealots fancy to their patron &s;aints. His dark re&s;olves were &s;haken! A&s;ti|anax, thus upon his guard, rendered the monk's enterpri&s;e impracticable.
<PB N="24" REF="24">The &s;haking of the armour was &s;u|pernatural. Con&s;cious evil filled the guilty mind of Father Peter with terrors and &s;elf-condemnation. His &s;oul let go its bloody purpo&s;e, and, for a moment, relaxed into re|mor&s;e; but for a moment only: For the &s;ucceeding thought turned on a future time to execute his project.</P>
<P>DURING the &s;hort time in which the&s;e few ideas moved within the mind of the eccle&s;ia&s;tic, A&s;tianax and he &s;tood motionle&s;s and &s;ilent; the monk gazing on the youth, and
<PB N="25" REF="25">the youth, with eyes uplifted, fixed on the armour. Peter broke &s;ilence, and, arming his bo&s;om with the to|kens of the cro&s;s, he called upon the &s;acred name of God to ble&s;s and &s;anctify him; that he might avoid the &s;nares and wiles of tho&s;e infernal beings which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this man&s;ion, and the frenzy'd &s;pirit of A&s;tianax. Amid&s;t this ejaculation, with uplift|ed eyes and hands, he turned to quit the chamber; when, behold, the loo&s;ened garment let the weapon pa&s;s, and at his feet the naked dag|ger dropt! This was the hour of
<PB N="26" REF="26">wonder to A&s;tianax! He &s;carce gave credit to what he &s;aw; his a&s;toni&s;hed mind could not form one conjecture, wherefore the good, the pious monk, wore in his bo&s;om this dire in&s;tru|ment. Confounded in the event, the monk, in ha&s;te, pa&s;s'd on, not noticing the matter, but apprehend|ing, that hence the youth would take the alarm, and ever, in his pre&s;ence, be on his guard.</P>
<P>SOON as A&s;tianax had recollected him&s;elf from his &s;urpri&s;e, he &s;tooped to take the dagger up; when he
<PB N="27" REF="27">beheld the onyx &s;ending forth more brilliant rays, than when he fir&s;t perceived it on the brea&s;t-plate of his ance&s;tor: He drop'd upon his knee, and, holding forth the glowing a|mulet, thus he poured forth his thoughts.</P>
<P><Q>MOST glorious relick of my &s;ire great Norban, do I not apprehend thy ine&s;timable value, and thy wonderous qualities! Whil&s;t &s;u&s;|pended on my bo&s;om, thy virtues can pre&s;age the unfore&s;een ap|proach of danger, and the ad|vancing
<PB N="28" REF="28">changes to pro&s;perity. Thy bloody tears foretel that hazard is not far behind, and thy lu&s;tre blazeth forth, to proclaim the foot&s;teps of &s;erenity and peace. O ye ble&s;&s;ed manes of my depart|ed ance&s;tors, if ye behold the la&s;t remains, this &s;ingle per&s;onage of your illu&s;trious blood, with eyes of approbation; and, with angelic love, guard me from pe|rils and the wiles of Satan; be pre&s;ent to my &s;oul in all its re&s;o|lutions; and &s;o in&s;pire me with the love of honour, that I may
<PB N="29" REF="29">emulate your glorious deeds, and imitate your virtuous lives; and when my regenerated &s;pirit &s;hall leave this vale of &s;in and &s;orrow|fulne&s;s, to meet you on the wings of light; may I be e&s;teemed de|&s;erving of your approbation, and adjudged worthy to be enrolled by the recording angel, in the illu|&s;trious table of your genealogy in heaven.</Q></P>
<P>THE monk retired into his &s;ecret cell, and there, in&s;tead of devoting his meditations to religious pro&s;|pects,
<PB N="30" REF="30">his temporal ambition and rapacious avarice, led him to form new plans for the de&s;truction of A&s;tianax. Lord Melvil was a man, who&s;e early life was di&s;&s;olute and vicious; every degree of fa&s;hionable error was familiar to him; in his la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, he ruined half his va&s;|&s;als; in his ebriety, he ma&s;tered the Herculean cup of Alexander; in him, ignorance begat ob&s;tinacy; his re|&s;entment was in&s;atiate; his will was arbitrary; and his whole demeans groaned under his authority. Age and di&s;ea&s;e had weakened his facul|ties,
<PB N="31" REF="31">but left his mind all unreform|ed. The churchmen took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul: They ingrafted bigotry upon the darkne&s;s of his under|&s;tanding; wound up the &s;prings of &s;uper&s;tition; and, from the horrors of their doctrine, induced his avarice to bend in purcha&s;e of &s;alvation. Large endowments had been made, and Father Peter's mona&s;tery en|riched with va&s;t donations. The enmity to Periander fir&s;t gave ri&s;e to the pro&s;ecuted claim of his e|&s;tates. Lord Melvil had devoted it, for a thou&s;and ma&s;&s;es more, to the
<PB N="32" REF="32">&s;ame mona&s;tery. The death of Pe|riander removed the object of the eccle&s;ia&s;tic's vengeance; but the ob|ject of his avarice was yet in being. The active &s;pirit of A&s;tianax the heir, and the unbounded love his excellencies gained him, together with his determined purpo&s;e, of ap|pealing to the King in per&s;on; &s;eem|ed to throw &s;uch ob&s;tacles to a de|&s;ign which fraud alone &s;upported, that Father Peter's &s;ubtlety was con|founded. He was convinced, that A&s;tianax would not be the &s;ame &s;u|pine opponent he had met with in
<PB N="33" REF="33">Periander: That he would never cea&s;e to trace the &s;ubject to its &s;ource; and that the e&s;teem his vir|tues had procured him, would prompt a thou&s;and friends to aid his &s;uit, and &s;econd his appeal before the King; again&s;t a Lord who&s;e vio|lence and oppre&s;&s;ion had long been infamous. He reflected, that the claim &s;u&s;tained it&s;elf upon a forgery. That the King, who&s;e youthful &s;oul was not &s;ubjected to the bigotries of church dominion, would give but little credit to the dormant legends of a mona&s;tery. The world already
<PB N="34" REF="34">entertained &s;u&s;picions of the artifices of eccle&s;ia&s;tics. Their large acqui|&s;itions had promoted jealou&s;ies, and thence their authorities grew di&s;|ta&s;teful. An apprehen&s;ion of the di&s;covery of this fraud brought ma|ny terrors. He reflected, that A&s;ti|anax was now the only one remain|ing of his ancient hou&s;e; and that, without an heir, his lands reverted to the lord. An ea&s;ier pa&s;&s;age this, than what he had devi&s;ed in the days of Periander. The death of A&s;tianax would accompli&s;h all his purpo&s;e. The perpetration com|mitted
<PB N="35" REF="35">to his own hands, avoided di&s;covery, and left no accomplice to betray the treachery. With &s;oul inured to &s;in, he re&s;olved upon the horrid project; but angels interpo|&s;ing held his hands, and fru&s;trated his device.</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e circum&s;tances, &s;ee the eccle&s;ia&s;tic in his cell: The re|ligious habit the cloak of hypocri&s;y ca&s;t from his inflamed bo&s;om, where di&s;appointment irritated all his &s;in|ful di&s;po&s;ition. On the table where he re&s;ted, &s;tood the image of a &s;uf|fering
<PB N="36" REF="36">Deity, &s;u&s;pended on the cro&s;s; a ro&s;ary, and a book of prayer. The holy go&s;pels lay upon his couch, with wafers, and the hallowed wa|ter-urn o'erwhelm'd. Objects, to other minds, excitive of reverence and adoration; to Father Peter no|thing more than inanimate emblems of his profe&s;&s;ion. With &s;uch atten|dants, who could apprehend that temporalities were all his care, Ra|pine and avarice! Vengeance and blood? Could not &s;uch objects touch thy hardened heart, and prompt thee to look inward on thy&s;elf? Inured
<PB N="37" REF="37">to wickedne&s;s, habituated to this cell with the&s;e its ornaments, even the repre&s;entation of an expiring Saviour, even the doctrines of the Son of God, availed not. Undeter|minate he in his gloomy mind, for &s;ome time revolved a thou&s;and &s;tra|tagems; and, with his wiles, he wearied out the midnight lamp.</P>
<P>ONE morning A&s;tianax was called, by &s;ome peculiar friends, to join the chace. Willing to remove the me|lancholy ideas which had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mind, he accepted the invitation.
<PB N="38" REF="38">The boar was rou&s;ed, was fierce, and made the hunters exerci&s;e all their alacrity and &s;kill. A&s;tianax was &s;eparated from his friends, one companion left with him in the &s;ame thicket, a &s;tranger, who, during the diver&s;ion, &s;eemed merely a di&s;tant &s;pectator; but, upon nearer ap|proach, appeared a &s;pectator ma&s;ked. The &s;ummer &s;un was vehement, and, for the freedom of the air, the youth had opened his bo&s;om, where the onyx &s;hone with rays di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;ome propitious moment was at hand. The &s;tranger &s;till approach|ing,
<PB N="39" REF="39">&s;eemed with cautious looks to &s;urvey the wood, as if he feared their privacy might be interrupted. He drew near, when, opening his upper garment, and the ma&s;k being withdrawn, or vani&s;hing, di&s;covered him to be an ancient Hermit, who&s;e venerable look and gracious coun|tenance be&s;poke benevolence and virtue. The appearance of &s;uch a per&s;on gave A&s;tianax &s;ome &s;ur|pri&s;e; the &s;ecrecy of the place, the di&s;gui&s;e, the fre&s;h impre&s;&s;ions Father Peter had left, all conduced to make him di&s;tru&s;t the holy looks of the
<PB N="40" REF="40">Hermit, and even to loo&s;e his con|fidence in the au&s;picious omens of the amulet. An expre&s;&s;ion of anxi|ety &s;ate on his features. From A&s;ti|anax's looks, the &s;age di&s;tingui&s;hed his ideas, for he was di&s;ciplined in phi&s;iognomy. "Young man," &s;ays he, <Q>lay a&s;ide all apprehen&s;ion that I de&s;ign you evil. I am no &s;tran|ger to the rea&s;on why my appear|ance troubles your thoughts. The late vi&s;it which you received from the principal of the mona&s;tery of St Benedict, is well known to me. I knew his enmity to Periander.

The crafts and artifices by which the church have hitherto held the vulgar in bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition, (an iron arbitrary reign), are gradually di&s;&s;ipating under the beams of learning; the darkne&s;s is &s;tricken, the terrors and the goblins vani&s;h, the authority of Rome wa&s;teth a|way! Such men as Father Peter

Men draw conclu&s;ions from appearances. Miracles are no longer the infatuation of this land.

<P>THAT his ancient family might not be extinct, he determined to marry; and, ere it was long, was made happy in the excellencies of Je&s;&s;alind, the daughter of a gentle|man,
<PB N="54" REF="54">who, with his family, for a few months, had vi&s;ited this land from Normandy. His fortune was but &s;mall, but his proper judgement had led him to give a liberal edu|cation to his daughter; who&s;e fine ta&s;te had been improved in every degree of learning fa&s;hionable in the age. She was &s;kilful in every do|me&s;tic art, and added thereto a per|fection in mu&s;ic and dancing. Her per&s;on was amiable, her manners elegant, and her &s;en&s;e refined.

<P>AMONGST a few &s;elect friends, who &s;ometimes with their vi&s;its changed the dome&s;tic &s;cene, Poli|dore had gained a great a&s;cendence over the mind of A&s;tianax. He had cultivated in his principles the mo&s;t punctual &s;en&s;e of honour, and in|&s;pired him with every military fer|vour for defence of that honour by arms. His readine&s;s in rendering &s;ervices, his alacrity in executing any project which he knew would
<PB N="56" REF="56">give plea&s;ure to his friend, his im|partial and di&s;intere&s;ted coun&s;els, had made A&s;tianax place in him the utmo&s;t confidence and e&s;teem. Whil&s;t tho&s;e two friends were one day alone in the grove which adjoin|ed to A&s;tianax's man&s;ion, thus Po|lidore addre&s;&s;ed him. <Q>I am &s;o well known to my friend, that I need not &s;eek to win his confidence, by a rehear&s;al of my &s;ervices; or gain his opinion of my veracity, by a&s;&s;ertions which would injure our mutual e&s;teem. My regard for A&s;tianax makes me jealous of
<PB N="57" REF="57">every injury done to his honour; and it becomes a duty in me to apprize him of every danger which be&s;ets him. Be not too much &s;hocked, my friend, by a di&s;covery in which your happi|ne&s;s is in imminent peril. Your Je&s;&s;alind is incon&s;tant!</Q></P>
<P>AT that expre&s;&s;ion, A&s;tianax &s;tarted, &s;huddered, and grew en|flamed. "Have a care," cries he, <Q>the&s;e are weapons too accute to &s;port with.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="58">POLIDORE &s;hewed a re&s;entful look at this reply. "Can you," &s;ays he, <Q>di&s;pute my veracity? Then let the re&s;t of the di&s;covery &s;leep. If you think I injure her, my profe&s;&s;ion allows you means to &s;atisfy your honour: You know I am a &s;oldier.</Q></P>
<P>THE experience which A&s;tianax had of Polidore's &s;incerity, gave him credulity: His thoughts were con|fu&s;ed, his judgement confounded; and, amid&s;t the di&s;traction of in|jured love, and the &s;hame of &s;uch
<PB N="59" REF="59">di&s;honour, he gave way to an im|petuous tide of jealou&s;y and re&s;ent|ment. He was greedy of hearing his own calamities and di&s;grace, and devoured the poi&s;onous and de&s;truc|tive tale with vehemence. Poli|dore, appea&s;ed by &s;uch apology as A&s;tianax, in his confu&s;ion, could utter, was prompted to pur&s;ue the horrid hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><Q>GRINVIL, your kin&s;man, who, from his earlie&s;t youth, hath been your intimate and bo&s;om friend, 'tis he that injures you. The

Is it not about the time at which you have often &s;aid, in this &s;ea&s;on of the year, your Je&s;|&s;alind retires to bathe?</Q> "It is," replies A&s;tianax, <Q>and what of that?</Q> "This winding walk," &s;ays Polidore, <Q>will lead us to the bath-hou&s;e undi&s;covered. I will attend you to the place, and leave you to be a&s;&s;ured of my truth.</Q> They ha&s;tened on: They arrive within &s;ight of the bath: Polidore departed.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="61">WITH arms enfolded, and with down-ca&s;t eyes, A&s;tianax &s;tood ru|minating on the tale. The more he revolved in his mind the circum|&s;tances and events attending his hours of married life, the more was he induced to di&s;credit the relation. A wi&s;h aro&s;e within his beating heart, born from reviving love and kindling hope: But &s;oon that wi&s;h was bla&s;ted, and jealou&s;y, in his dire realm of chaos, &s;wept away ex|tingui&s;hed hope, and &s;wallowed up expiring love; when, with eyes &s;hedding tears of di&s;traction, he be|held
<PB N="62" REF="62">the amulet portending woe. In a few moments, as he &s;tood thus concealed in his &s;hady &s;ituation, he viewed the lovely Je&s;&s;alind, without attendant, moving to the bath. The &s;erenity of virtue &s;ate &s;mooth upon her brow; placid innocence be|calm'd her looks, whil&s;t fond feli|city was &s;porting with in&s;u&s;picion in dimples on her cheek. Over his whole &s;oul, affection lay bleeding. His eyes, as they dwelt upon the object, &s;wam in tears; whil&s;t the blackne&s;s of his mind, in mourning, ab&s;orbed the image from the aching
<PB N="63" REF="63">optics, and never returned one fair refraction to the &s;eat of love. When nature &s;truggled, to give birth to hope, the amulet, and Po|lidore's known faith, ob&s;tructed every pa&s;&s;age, but the influx of de|&s;pair.</P>
<P>SHE entered the bath. The &s;ound of &s;everal voices &s;truck A&s;ti|anax's ear! His heart was thrown into dreadful convul&s;ions, and all his bo&s;om blazed with re&s;entment. His impatience became un&s;upport|able, he ru&s;hed from his conceal|ment;
<PB N="64" REF="64">and, bur&s;ting into the anti|chamber of the bath, di&s;covered the di&s;concerted and alarmed Je&s;&s;alind, with the treacherous Grinvil! For jealou&s;y, for madne&s;s, this was evi|dence &s;ufficient. The emotions of A&s;tianax's brea&s;t &s;tifled his words; he only had power left him to call Grinvil to defend him&s;elf. Grinvil would have parley'd, but A&s;tianax ru&s;hed on. The terrified Je&s;&s;alind fainted! Sword met with &s;word, and, in the bo&s;om of Grinvil, the horrid &s;teel was plunged!</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="65">SCARCE breathing from his vic|tory, A&s;tianax &s;tepped forward to de&s;troy the fair, the in&s;en&s;ible Je&s;|&s;alind! A dreadful bur&s;t of thunder &s;eem'd to make the earth tremble to the centre! Rous'd from the ve|ry gra&s;p of death, Grinvil ca&s;t up his hand and eyes; and, faulter|ing, bid him forbear! The attitude, the accents of his dying friend, &s;eem'd to expre&s;s &s;omething irre&s;i&s;t|ible! Ga&s;ping with rage, A&s;tianax pau&s;ed, as the lion over his captive &s;tag, when breathle&s;s with the chace, to meditate his ravenous repa&s;t.
<PB N="66" REF="66">Grinvil took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this inter|val. <Q>If you &s;u&s;pect the virtue of your wife, you are deceived. Our meeting here was accidental.

<P>ASTIANAX, like one who heard the direful voice of an avenging an|gel, denouncing de&s;olation to whole empires, &s;tood fixed in horror! His extended eyes &s;hifted their di&s;tract|ed
<PB N="67" REF="67">&s;tare from Je&s;&s;alind to Grin|vil! His trembling hands, &s;tained with the murder of his friend, con|vul&s;ively gra&s;ped his reeking &s;word! Irre&s;olute for &s;uicide; irre&s;olute for flight; too proud to &s;eek for &s;anc|tuary; not longer able to endure the horrid &s;pectacle, he &s;ought the grove; he &s;ought &s;ome hiding place, where he might form a re&s;olution for his conduct. The grove renew|ed his grief. Con&s;cience cea&s;es not to haunt the &s;teps of guilt. The grove, the bath, alike afforded him objects for de&s;pair: Too late he
<PB N="68" REF="68">proved the want of di&s;cretion in Polidore; for, from his well-proved faith, he could never conceive that he was treacherous: Too late he re|collects the pious precepts of the Hermit on the cha&s;e: Too late he finds that the abortive claim, &s;o ba&s;ely in&s;tigated by the Benedictine, was now effected; and, as a mur|derer, not only life was forfeited, but his lands e&s;cheated to Lord Mel|vil! How dreadful was the pro&s;pect of his total de&s;olation? Dive&s;ted of his property; guilty of innocent blood; a victim due to ju&s;tice. By
<PB N="69" REF="69">one ra&s;h act, ru&s;hed from the height of human happine&s;s, into the dark|e&s;t gulph of woe! Fallen from af|fluence, from the joys of virtuous love, dome&s;tic harmony, and heart|felt &s;elf-approving rectitude and ho|nour! But yet, to aggravate and crown his mi&s;ery, the innocent tra|duced Je&s;&s;alind, widowed, in penury, and at the in&s;tant pregnant.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t interval of judgement, prompted A&s;tianax to &s;eek the thicke&s;t cover of an adjoining fore&s;t to conceal him, till the approach of
<PB N="70" REF="70">night; as he was a&s;&s;ured, in the&s;e walks, the alarm would &s;peedily be &s;pread, and his e&s;cape fru&s;trated; thence, under the favour of the darkne&s;s, he determined to proceed into the mountains, and, at &s;ome &s;ecure di&s;tance, live unknown; till, perchance, a favourable opportunity might pre&s;ent, to gain an advocate for the obtaining royal clemency.</P>
<P>How di&s;tracting a &s;cene pre&s;ented it&s;elf to Je&s;&s;alind, upon her recovery from her &s;woon: Grinvil weltering in his blood, convul&s;ed, and in the
<PB N="71" REF="71">agonies of death! A&s;tianax gone! gone full of condemnations, jealou&s;y and hatred again&s;t his innocent and forlorn Je&s;&s;alind! "Then," cries &s;he, <Q>all the remainder of exi&s;tence is given to de&s;pair!</Q> With lamen|tations and di&s;hevel'd hair, &s;he fled into the avenue, and &s;trained her voice with ince&s;&s;ant calls on her be|loved hu&s;band! No voice reply'd but plaintive echo, &s;obbing in the gloomy grove. She flew to her late happy habitation: The dome&s;tics, alarmed at her complainings, &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed, and melting into tears.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="72">As &s;oon as the dreadful &s;tory was related, Grinvil's body was removed by a faithful old &s;ervant; and by him carried to a friend, a &s;hepherd, who inhabited a cot, in an adjoining valley; a man well &s;killed in &s;alutary drugs; and one, who, in his youth, from long &s;ervices in arms, had ac|quired a wonderous knowledge in the art of &s;urgery: Some faint re|mains of life appearing, he had hopes the wound might not prove mortal.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="73">WHILST the&s;e matters were tran|&s;acting, the rumour &s;pread with ra|pid wing, and &s;oon had reached Lord Melvil's ears; who&s;e officers, like hungry wolves upon the &s;now|cloath'd Alps, poured down their rude rapacious bands on the e&s;tates of the unfortunate A&s;tianax.

<P>THE wretches who executed Lord Melvil's commi&s;&s;ion, conjecturing they were be&s;et with evil &s;pirits, fled, and left the place without inhabit|ants.</P>
<P>THE report of the&s;e amazing cir|cum&s;tances bu&s;y'd the ear of every villager. It reach'd the mona&s;tery of St Benedict. The prie&s;ts, enfla|med with the zeal of their hypocri|&s;y,
<PB N="76" REF="76">rejoiced in the intelligence, e|&s;teeming all the&s;e wonders, as the bugbears born of Credulity and Ig|norance: And, apprehending this a fortunate opportunity to execute their exorci&s;ms, and acquire an impi|ous credit with the vulgar, by exer|ci&s;ing the miraculous privilege of chaining &s;pirits by their religious of|ces; they &s;ought their principal to crave his licence, for their vi&s;iting the hou&s;e of the unfortunate A&s;tianax.

At this very in&s;tant Father Peter enter|tained a vi&s;iter, who&s;e friend&s;hip was not to be neglected. The grant of A&s;tianax's e&s;cheated lands, already was framing for the records of the mona&s;tery: And Polidore was &s;hut up with the monk in his cell, to claim the mi&s;erable reward of his ine&s;timable &s;ervices. Polidore had been gained by avarice and great gratuities, to perpetrate the wor&s;t of crimes. The monk, baffled in
<PB N="78" REF="78">his former projects, ca&s;t his eyes to|wards the &s;oldier, who&s;e love of gain he perceived &s;tood incompa|tible with his &s;incerity; and that intere&s;t could ea&s;ily &s;ubvert his &s;pe|cious principles. He won the &s;oul of this ba&s;e man, by a&s;&s;urances that certain lands which lay contiguous to his &s;canty farm, &s;hould be grant|ed by the mona&s;tery, together with infallible ab&s;olution, if he &s;hould be the means of A&s;tianax's overthrow. Artful and &s;ubtle, he devi&s;ed the plan; and, at this in&s;tant, the trai|tor li&s;tened to a&s;&s;urances, that &s;o

<P>THE malicious monk, re&s;olute in his purpo&s;e, had determined to engage this his emi&s;&s;ary; for, from his having been many years a mi&s;|&s;ionary in his younger days, he had acquired a competent knowledge of the di&s;po&s;ition of a &s;oldier, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">born in abject life, and bred a mercenary; and, whil&s;t he fixed his project and his plan, thus he meditated on the character of his accomplice.</P>

<PB N="84" REF="84">tracks, &s;ome little plots of gra&s;s were &s;cattered, inviting to repo&s;e; and, down the rifted cliffs, a &s;tream of water trickled through the mo&s;s, to tempt the fainting lips with its refre&s;hment. The weary limbs will yield to re&s;t, even amid&s;t the afflic|tions of the mind. The gra&s;s, the murmuring breeze, the water-trill, all tempted &s;leep. A&s;tianax &s;unk into repo&s;e. Ere long, beyond the hills the di&s;tant thunders growl'd, and gu&s;hing winds bu&s;tle through the rocks. The &s;torm advances, and now a horrid peal bur&s;ts o'er
<PB N="85" REF="85">A&s;tianax's head. A&s;toni&s;hed he a|wakes. In terror he cries out, <Q>Here re&s;ts the mi&s;creant, O Lord: From thee the &s;inner finds no hiding place: Thy vengeance ever overtakes the guilty.</Q> The hea|vy clouds were rent; light changing in&s;tantaneous with darkne&s;s; floods of lightning fill the whole welkin with a blaze; light, too acute for mortal eye, &s;ucceeds impenetrable darkne&s;s; the loud thunder-claps, which &s;eemed to convul&s;e the world, in their intervals, were followed by a dreary univer&s;al &s;ilence, in which
<PB N="86" REF="86">the very breezes &s;lept. A&s;tianax trembled! The human mind, con|&s;cious of evil, is bu&s;y to torment it|&s;elf. Guilt dragging on remor&s;e, brings terror his attendant. A&s;tia|nax doubted not the angry arm of Providence wielded the &s;torm, to brand the odious wretch, who&s;e hands were red with the murder of his friend, and who&s;e head was o|verwhelmed with the mi&s;ery of ha|ving undone a virtuous wife, and beggar'd his progeny even in the womb.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="87">AT length the hurricane &s;ub&s;ides, and, ere it was long, the morning dawns; the clouds had gathered up their heavy &s;kirts, and left the ho|rizon tinged with a &s;ilver ray, which lighted up the pale grey eye of morn. The di&s;tant hills were green to the view, and night's la&s;t &s;ha|dow fled adown the valleys, mixing with the blue trimmed vapours. The heavens above were muffled in a &s;haggy cloak, like ruffled plumes, when the awaking vulture &s;hakes his pinions. At length the fringe of every folding cloud was &s;tained
<PB N="88" REF="88">with crim&s;on; the dye improves, till the whole velvet mantle of the ri&s;ing day, glowed into &s;carlet, ed|ged with burni&s;hed gold; and forth a&s;cends the ruddy orb of light, ex|ulting in the race he now renews. All nature, as if a&s;hamed of being caught within the &s;luggard arms of &s;leep, wore blu&s;hes. Now the uni|ver&s;al &s;ilence is &s;ubdued: The birds awake the &s;ong: The curlew pipes it as he pa&s;&s;es on: The plover, on her bu&s;tling pinion, &s;allies round, and the heath cock cackles to his
<PB N="89" REF="89">brood, to lead them to the &s;weet re|pa&s;t of bilberries luxuriant.</P>
<P>How cheering is the face of morn to innocence! but to A&s;tianax it was increa&s;e of woe. The night re|moved, removes his &s;afety. Pent in by rocks, within a narrow &s;pace, far from the road of any pa&s;&s;engers, &s;ave &s;hepherds, he re&s;olved to pa&s;s away the day; and when the eve|ning returned, pur&s;ue his way into the mountains, where there are mines; and there, among&s;t the&s;e mi&s;erable men, who earn a &s;orry
<PB N="90" REF="90">&s;u&s;tenance, by labouring in the bow|els of the earth, he might at once &s;upport exi&s;tence, and conceal him|&s;elf, till he could &s;end intelligence to Alfred, the father of his Je&s;&s;alind, of his &s;ituation, that he might move the throne for pardon. Among&s;t the cliffs, he gathered berries to &s;tay his hunger, from briers, brambles, and the juniper, and drank his drink fre&s;h from the fountain's lip.</P>
<P>As he &s;ate in tears, to pa&s;s away the heavy hours of day, the dreary
<PB N="91" REF="91">wa&s;te &s;urrounding, afforded no pro&s;|pects to amu&s;e the mind; where Na|ture &s;ate in De&s;olation's weeds, and mourned the long protracted ab&s;ence of Sylva and her &s;i&s;ter Ceres. All around, or hill, or dale, was clad in ru&s;&s;et heath; &s;ave here and there a barren mountain lifts its rugged brow, a ma&s;s of &s;torm-bleach'd cliffs, where vegetation, from the reign of chaos, never &s;miled; or chance &s;ome plots lying on the di&s;tant &s;teep, from whence the heath, by lightning burnt, had made a &s;pace for gra&s;s and pa&s;turage; where &s;haggy goats
<PB N="92" REF="92">were &s;een to climb, or &s;ome few &s;cattered &s;heep; over which a &s;tar|ving &s;hepherd hung, de&s;ponding of the providence of Heaven; and &s;carce believes him&s;elf the better brute. Whil&s;t near at hand a ha&s;ty brook was &s;een, as driven on from rock to rock in cour&s;e confu&s;ed, pouring its frothy &s;treams precipi|tate; impatient to e&s;cape the in|ho&s;pitable, the native land: Along who&s;e channel rocks be&s;et with yew, &s;tand mutes to mourn her pa&s;&s;age into happier climes. No &s;wallow flitted through the winding way, nor
<PB N="93" REF="93">rail con&s;oled her negro race with chearful call: A &s;ad re&s;ort for &s;ick|ening goats, a &s;ecret dell where they could hide their woe from mortal eye; &s;ave a &s;ingle pair of ravens, who occupied the place, and named it the vale of melancholy; where, to the ear of mi&s;ery, they told the daily tale of death. Whil&s;t o'er the &s;pacious tract of moor, and down the dreary dale, A&s;tianax's eye wearily wandered, the &s;un had &s;hot his rays beyond the cloud, and light|ed up the di&s;tant hill, where, grief to his &s;oul, at the &s;tretch of &s;ight, he
<PB N="94" REF="94">viewed the fair enclo&s;ures, and the chearful verdure of a cultivated land, as extending from out the richer valley. The vapours which o'erhang the dale, &s;eeming to blaze with light, as if the God of nature &s;hed a bounteous &s;mile upon the favoured &s;cene.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome days journey, di|&s;tance &s;ecured the wanderer; and now he ventured forth by day. In his wretched journey, accident had brought him to a &s;hepherd's hut, placed in a little vale, &s;urrounded
<PB N="95" REF="95">by a chain of mountains; where a few acres, with fre&s;h verdure, pa&s;tu|red a cow. The hills de&s;cending to the &s;outh, abounded with wild thyme, and variegated pan&s;ies; where a flock of &s;heep, with fleeces white as &s;now, were &s;cattered up and down. The northern hills &s;tood rugged and black, mourning the di&s;tant God of day, who only once a year, &s;hot tran&s;ver&s;e rays acro&s;s the wa&s;te; and look'd a&s;kance up|on the &s;eat of barrenne&s;s. Through this valley a little &s;tream, with many meandrings, winds its tardy pace,
<PB N="96" REF="96">as if it lingered in the &s;cene it loved. Along the margin nodding willows play'd with fond reflection in the &s;ilver lake: There hazels mixed with poplars &s;tand, where thru&s;hes whi&s;tle on the rural &s;ong of &s;weet retirement. A little plain fronted the hut, where a &s;ingle thorn had grown for half a century; beneath who&s;e &s;hade, a bench built up of &s;tones and turf, afforded a plea&s;ing re&s;ting place. Thick ivy covered the cottage front, and hou&s;e leek ornamented the thatch. A little plot of garden ground was &s;tocked
<PB N="97" REF="97">with roots; where, in one continued range, a multitude of bee-hives &s;tood, and, in the &s;un&s;hine, &s;ent their buzzing myriads forth to la|bour. At the approach of A&s;tianax, a dog that &s;lumbered in his watch, gave the alarm; and, to his bark|ings echo from the hill, repeats the &s;ignal to the di&s;tant &s;wain. A grey old man came forth, who&s;e coun|tenance &s;hone with benevolence; as wondering to behold a man in gay apparel wandering there, amid&s;t the mountains, far from any road, a place &s;carce acce&s;&s;ible, and &s;eldom
<PB N="98" REF="98">vi&s;ited by any but &s;hepherds: He, for a while, remained &s;ilent, whil&s;t he &s;urveyed A&s;tianax with deep at|tention. He &s;aluted him: Enquired what occa&s;ion brought him there, and what tho&s;e &s;orrows were which he perceived to hang upon his brow. A&s;tianax returned his gracious looks with tears. "Father," &s;ays he, <Q>I am unfortunate: My mi&s;eries have overwhelmed me: The treachery of men hath made me hate their intercour&s;e: And here I wander, finding greater &s;atisfaction in wa&s;tes and wilds, &s;u&s;taining life
<PB N="99" REF="99">with berries and the fountain's brim, than in the crowded hall bu&s;y'd with &s;ervile cringing dogs, and &s;melling rank of luxury and riot.</Q></P>
<P>THE &s;hepherd, from his talk, con|ceived A&s;tianax was di&s;ordered in his mind. His compa&s;&s;ion prompt|ed him to lend his aid to calm his troubled rea&s;on. Charity, with her looks benign, lighted up his coun|tenance; and the Divinity &s;hone forth his pre&s;ence on his features: Wi&s;dom, with &s;ilver-hair'd experi|ence,
<PB N="100" REF="100">&s;tood confe&s;t o'er all his figure: "Ble&s;&s;ed old age," exclaimed the enraptured A&s;tianax, <Q>in thee man|kind confe&s;s the image which God ordained in the fir&s;t crea|tion.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>"YOUNG man," interrupts the &s;hepherd, <Q>re&s;t here a little. Fir&s;t, I pray thee, recollect, that all the ways of Providence are left un|&s;earchable to human under&s;tand|ing; and &s;o blind are we, that of|tentimes tho&s;e things which we e&s;teem calamities, lead to the
<PB N="101" REF="101">birth of our felicity; and what is pre&s;ent evil, is the very pa&s;&s;age to our pro&s;perity. Tell me whence are all thy &s;orrows. I would talk to thee of that all-&s;eeing ever|bounteous God, who, de&s;pi&s;ing not the &s;ighings of a contrite heart, drieth up the tears of men in mi&s;ery. Perchance I thus, his mini&s;ter, may lend thee con&s;ola|tion.</Q> A&s;tianax was moved a|new: He recollected the admoni|tions of the Hermit: Con&s;cious that he had neglected his &s;age precepts, and yielded him&s;elf a &s;acrifice to
<PB N="102" REF="102">pa&s;&s;ion, fre&s;h tears were &s;hed. After &s;ome moments of a&s;toni&s;hment, that the judgement of each re|verend teacher had admoni&s;hed him to principles of the like import, and weighing in his thought the tenor of his crimes, as being incapable of con&s;olation; he replies, <Q>In vain you talk of that great Being, in whom alone is peace: In vain you a&s;k of my afflictions: My mi&s;eries are not to be revealed: The &s;ecret, through a thou&s;and vows, is bound in darkne&s;s! The recollection will for ever be my
<PB N="103" REF="103">torment; madne&s;s would attend de&s;cription! The ba&s;ene&s;s, the villainies, the treacheries of man|kind, afford a hi&s;tory &s;o horrid, that their permi&s;&s;ion, in the eye of Heaven, would make even zealots &s;tagger from their religion into infidelity, and bla&s;phemou&s;ly cry, amid&s;t the darkne&s;s, there is no God! My wretchedne&s;s hath wre&s;tled with con&s;olation by the way, and the Comforter is pa&s;&s;ed by. Time once elap&s;ed turneth not his wings. Offended Heaven hath marked me with the &s;eal of
<PB N="104" REF="104">fate; from the cele&s;tial eye I wan|der forth, like Cain, to hide me from the countenance divine, which I have enflamed with wrath; if, in this world, a place is found where God abideth not. But behold! amid&s;t the&s;e horrid wa&s;tes, this little paradi&s;e is pla|ced, where he communes with &s;hepherds.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome little talk, the good old man de&s;ired his vi&s;iter to take re|fre&s;hment, and &s;et before him, milk, with butter, honey, and bread; and,
<PB N="105" REF="105">to conclude the me&s;s, in a plain cup of horn, &s;erved him with nectar, brewed from the &s;tores the bu&s;y bees had yielded. The cheering re|pa&s;t, afforded gayer &s;pirits. The &s;hepherd, with joy, perceived his gue&s;t's countenance much brighten|ed: His benevolent heart exulted, he a&s;ks the &s;tranger to enter his hut, where a grave bending matron, the con&s;ort of the &s;hepherd's hap|pine&s;s, was a&s;&s;iduous in the cleanly offices of her hou&s;ehold. From the hills returned the &s;hepherd's two &s;ons; hardy and hale the youths
<PB N="106" REF="106">breath'd fre&s;hne&s;s and health. In gratitude for the bounty of their father, A&s;tianax, from his pur&s;e, pre&s;ented them with each two broad pieces of gold. Wonder &s;truck their countenance; they were a&s;toni&s;h'd at the gift; and their hearts were filled with wi&s;hes, to render him good offices.</P>
<P>ASTIANAX aro&s;e, and bid the &s;hepherd and his family adieu. The old man &s;tay'd him, earne&s;tly de|&s;iring to know, whither he &s;ought to go, or where he hoped to re&s;t?
<PB N="107" REF="107">The que&s;tion could not be re&s;olved. He knew not whither he wandered; but, to the importuning of his ho&s;t, at length he an&s;wered: <Q>I &s;eek &s;ome place for my retirement, where Innocence and Truth have form|ed their habitation; if they, ere this, are not e&s;cap'd to Heaven. I have for&s;worn the bu&s;y world, and &s;eek to form &s;ome Hermitage, where I may &s;pend my life in prayer and meditation, by penitence to pur|cha&s;e expiation of my crimes. Some Hermitage where few men come, and yet where human
<PB N="108" REF="108">&s;teps may tread, that &s;eeing them I may remember what I am; and renewing to my mind the hi&s;tory of mankind, I may daily, to the throne of Heaven, put up pe|titions for mercies on them; to repay evil with good, and clo&s;e this life of mi&s;ery and care, in &s;upplications for the pardon of the world.</Q></P>
<P>"AN Hermitage you &s;eek," replies the &s;hepherd, <Q>the Hermitage of Paul Du' Monte, as old tradition goes, was near this place.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="109">THE name Du' Monte &s;truck A&s;tianax with horror! His own &s;ir|name. He thought he had a&s;&s;ocia|ted with necromancers. The old man beheld his agitation with &s;ur|pri&s;e, and a&s;k'd the cau&s;e: But he was replied to with &s;ighs. <Q>My &s;ons,</Q> added the &s;hepherd, <Q>&s;hall attend you to the hill, where, &s;to|ry tells, this ancient Hermit dwelt; a man of holy life, and &s;age be|yond his race: Of noted birth, near in blood to nobles; yet there he dwelt. The fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e pa&s;t over, A&s;tianax, with impatience,
<PB N="110" REF="110">de&s;ired the young men would ac|company him.</Q> The ta&s;k was arduous, but they were ready to te&s;tify their gratitude by &s;uch their a&s;&s;iduity. <Q>Repo&s;e your&s;elf with us this night,</Q> the &s;hepherd &s;aid, <Q>the &s;pot is di&s;tant &s;ix hours jour|ney; there I have a few good goats; and, at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, the&s;e my &s;ons go near the place, to &s;ee how fares my herd. In the morning they &s;hall &s;hew the way; and, that the hours may not &s;eem irk&s;ome, I will relate to you the hi&s;tory, as I received it from my grand&s;ire;
<PB N="111" REF="111">who, though then of ninety years of age, had heard the tale when young, as a relation of far di&s;tant facts.</Q> With anxious ear Affia|nax attended. The &s;hepherd thus:</P>
<P><Q>FROM Normandy the good man came, the younge&s;t &s;on of Lord Du' Monte. Bred to the holy office of a prie&s;t; he was a member of the priory of St Au|gu&s;tine.</Q></P>
<P>ASTIANAX was greatly agitated at this prelude. His colour came
<PB N="112" REF="112">and fled alternately. The &s;hepherd, ob&s;erving his confu&s;ion, a&s;ked him; <Q>Wherefore the &s;tory moved him? The hi&s;tory of a man, who, cen|turies ago, had hid him&s;elf amid&s;t the&s;e wilds; and of whom he ap|prehended, A&s;tianax had never heard till then.</Q> To conceal his thoughts, he replied: <Q>The &s;tory, in its beginning, reminds me of my father, who, in my youth, would often laugh, and tell of mad Du' Monte. The memory of that father, is &s;acred to my &s;oul. The&s;e &s;ighs a duteous tri|bute
<PB N="113" REF="113">to his memory. His parental virtues are indelibly written on my recollection.</Q></P>
<P>"To the Hermit," continued the &s;hepherd, <Q>in reward for his great piety, a vi&s;iting angel left the realms of light, to pour upon him gifts mo&s;t excellent and &s;uperna|tural. The gift of healing was his own, and &s;imples gathered from the cliffs and wilds, became from him mo&s;t &s;alutary medicine. His knowledge in Nature's &s;ecrets was exten&s;ive; he foretold the
<PB N="114" REF="114">&s;ea&s;ons and their changes, and &s;aw the dire approach of famine, pe&s;tilence, or war. His wi&s;dom afforded him the power of upright judgement; and with the &s;hep|herds he was judge, determining their wrongs and injuries. He taught the rude&s;t men the &s;en&s;e of moral virtues; and the lips of infants breath'd his prayer. The &s;ins and &s;ubtleties of the eccle&s;ia|&s;tics of St Augu&s;tine's hou&s;e di&s;|gu&s;ted him: Their avarice and their intrigues were oft his talk; and, when he uttered condemna|tions
<PB N="115" REF="115">on their lives, he trembled for the wrath of Heaven, which tho&s;e mo&s;t impious men provoked by their hypocri&s;y. The errors of tho&s;e learned &s;inners, defying the enlightened &s;pirit of &s;cience, hardily braving a Deity, in who&s;e name they taught deceit, and cloak'd the wor&s;t of crimes, &s;o offended the upright &s;oul of Paul Du' Monte, that he &s;ought the&s;e barren mountains, there to devote his life to piety and god|ly works. In this &s;olitude he remained for many &s;ea&s;ons; at
<PB N="116" REF="116">length, age and infirmity had bent his reverend figure; and every day, for long he &s;ate at the en|trance of his cell, as if watchful for his relea&s;ing angel, to give his &s;pirit freedom from mortality: And every &s;hepherd often would he a&s;k, if yet no &s;tranger was perceived about the moun|tains, as que&s;ting for his habita|tion. At length the vi&s;iter ap|peared, with whom he &s;eemed affectionately intimate. One day he &s;ummoned to his cell the neighbouring herd&s;men, and thus
<PB N="117" REF="117">addre&s;&s;ed them: That you may declare my words unto your chil|dren, and they to late po&s;terity deli|ver the tradition down, I call you here. You have known me long, and know my truth; this vi&s;iter he is my brother. I had foretold his coming, and I knew it was the &s;ig|nal of my mortal di&s;&s;olution. Scarce yet an hour remains for life. The herds all lov'd the Hermit, and all wept. Forth from his brea&s;t he drew a crucifix, and placed it on his brother's neck: Wear this, he cries, beloved Norban.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="118">AT that name A&s;tianax, like one &s;truck with in&s;tantaneous lightning, &s;tarted, and &s;unk upon a knee, with hands extended towards the &s;hep|herd, in a&s;toni&s;hment, devouring every accent, and each look.</P>
<P>THE old man thought the&s;e were the &s;tarts and pa&s;&s;ions of his malady, pitying which, he forbore to pro|ceed. A&s;tianax, yet kneeling, and trembling with impatience, reque&s;t|ed him to go on. He obeyed. <Q>Wear this, beloved Norban, &s;aid the Hermit; &s;word, pe&s;tilence,
<PB N="119" REF="119">and &s;torms, &s;hall never injure thee, whil&s;t this crucifix &s;hall hang upon thy neck. The jewel of extraordinary nature, no &s;oon|er re&s;ted on the bo&s;om of Norban, than forth it &s;hed a blaze of light, too piercing for the herds to gaze upon. This &s;halt thou wear, continued the Hermit, till a good old age &s;hall lead thee through the tranquil hours, and yield thee to the peaceful &s;leep of death; but I charge thee, never divulge to any of thy kindred what further I relate. When the hour of thy
<PB N="120" REF="120">di&s;&s;olution comes upon thee, en|join thy &s;on in vows, that with thy armour this gem may hang within the man&s;ion of Du' Monte: There it &s;hall hang for ages, till one of thy good race, whom Heaven appoints to give re&s;t unto my a&s;hes, &s;hall rea&s;&s;ume it, and with it all its virtues.</Q></P>
<P>THE agitation &s;till encrea&s;ed with|in the bo&s;om of A&s;tianax: He &s;carce appeared to breathe, for won|der! The &s;hepherd went on. <Q>La|ment not for me, &s;aid the Her|mit,
<PB N="121" REF="121">it is alone the fle&s;h which &s;leeps: For I &s;hall change this na|ture into &s;pirit, that I may, for &s;even ages yet to come, become the guardian of my friends: Un|til the&s;e bones &s;hall lie with my forefathers in the tomb, my &s;oul &s;hall be a wanderer in the middle regions; thence I &s;hall pa&s;s, a me|diating &s;pirit, into the pre&s;ence of the Divinity, pre&s;enting the pe|titions of thy po&s;terity on earth, before his everla&s;ting throne. In that period of time, when my a&s;hes &s;hall re&s;t in the &s;epulchre of
<PB N="122" REF="122">the Du' Montes, thy i&s;&s;ue Norban will again rea&s;&s;ume their ducal ti|tle, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the large demains which Norman William granted to our ance&s;tor, as a reward for his illu&s;trious virtues. Depart, he cry'd, and leave me to my prayer. Indulge this la&s;t embrace &mdash;a brother's ki&s;s&mdash;adieu!</Q></P>
<P>NORBAN, with the herd&s;men, re|tired, and left the cell. In&s;tantly the mountain &s;hook, as if the world was falling into ruin; in the &s;trange convul&s;ion, the rocks, with mighty

The cell was clo&s;ed, and, from the cliffs above, a headlong torrent ru&s;h|ed, in who&s;e waters the &s;un beams &s;truck, and &s;hewed a blaze of light, like that protecting &s;word, which &s;hone at Eden's gate, to guard the &s;acred pa&s;s.</P>
<P>NORBAN, with the &s;pectators, fled in a&s;toni&s;hment! A&s;tianax, in &s;ilence,
<PB N="124" REF="124">li&s;tened to the late&s;t accents, which, for &s;ome time, &s;eemed to &s;ound up|on his wondering ear. His attitude was motionle&s;s, until the &s;hepherd, in compa&s;&s;ion to his malady, lent him his arm, and rou&s;ed him from his depth of thought. With cla&s;p|ing hands, and eyes uplifted, he re|peats: <Q>Till one of thy good race, whom Heaven appoints to give re&s;t unto my a&s;hes, &s;hall rea&s;&s;ume it, and with it all its virtues.&mdash; Mo&s;t wonderful and mo&s;t my&s;te|rious &s;entences!

<P>THE good old &s;hepherd &s;miled, and his two &s;ons laughed out aloud, at the&s;e his &s;trange extravagancies. A&s;tianax was not moved at their improprieties.</P>
<P>"GRANT unto me," he cries with an encrea&s;ing fervour, <Q>grant

<P>HE rai&s;ed him&s;elf, and, on his o|pened bo&s;om hung the onyx, blaz|ing forth a lu&s;tre equal to the mid|night moon, when pa&s;&s;ing clouds
<PB N="128" REF="128">give forth her &s;ilver rays on the &s;till ocean, as &s;he rolls her chariot wheels o'er her meridian. Amazement &s;truck the cottagers! they were a|&s;hamed of their arrogance, and turn|ed away their face! A&s;tianax con|&s;oled them: His wild appearance carry'd the impre&s;&s;ions they had entertained. No wonder the idea of &s;uch malady had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their minds at his being &s;een amid&s;t the wilde&s;t wa&s;tes of Britain, where none but &s;hepherds had, for ages pa&s;t, been known to vi&s;it: But now they looked upon the &s;tranger as a man
<PB N="129" REF="129">of God, led forth by Providence's &s;ecret hand, on emba&s;&s;y miraculous.</P>
<P>SOON as it was morning, A&s;tianax, with the two young &s;hepherds, pro|ceeded to the hills. The country &s;eemed to have changed its a&s;pect; the young men wandered on be|wildered! Terror came upon them, and they fled! A&s;tianax all the day per&s;evered in his journey up the &s;teeps, led by a winding way which &s;eemed to have been worn by pa&s;|&s;ing goats. At length, fatigued, he &s;ate down beneath the covert of a
<PB N="130" REF="130">&s;olitary yew, which hung from off the brink of rocks yet une&s;&s;ay'd; and, night approaching, there he &s;lept! And, as he &s;lept, his mind was touched with images, far di|&s;tant from the thoughts which had employed the day. His friend, the &s;laughtered Grinvil, &s;eem'd to pa&s;s before him, array'd for battle. Lau|rels wreathed a verdant &s;hade over his ca&s;que; and, on his &s;word the image of victory &s;tood graven; the field was gay with &s;pring; and, o'er the flowers, his &s;teed on bounding pa&s;terns, &s;eemed to tread as light as
<PB N="131" REF="131">air; and, &s;porting with the bit, &s;ub|mitted play-fully to his re&s;traint. The dreamer's fluttering heart re|ceived the accents uttered by the &s;hade: <Q>Did A&s;tianax but live, did the brave man but know that Grinvil is on earth, and heard him call him to the field of glory, how would his bounding &s;oul leap from the fetters of de&s;pair and wretchedne&s;s, and glow with the ardour of reviving virtue? bright|er blazing, as the meteor adds to its lu&s;tre, by the darkne&s;s of the night, from whence it bur&s;ts into
<PB N="132" REF="132">exi&s;tence. Then would I re&s;tore him to the&s;e worthy friends, and &s;ave a &s;uicide! They follow me.</Q> The vi&s;ion &s;eemed to keep &s;ilence. When there &s;ucceeded, dre&s;t in bri|dal robes, a fair one led reluctant on, who&s;e down-ca&s;t countenance was hidden from the dreamer's eye. At di&s;tance &s;tood the wedding couch crowded with attendants, and over|&s;pread with ro&s;es: The crim&s;on curtain was &s;upported by laughing Cupids, and the blu&s;hing Graces played with the bridal girdle. As the bride approach'd the bed, with
<PB N="133" REF="133">tear-fill'd eyes, &s;he ca&s;t up looks of angui&s;h to the &s;kies, and lifted her re&s;olute arm to plunge a dagger in her bo&s;om, crying out: <Q>I never cea&s;e to love thee, my A&s;tianax!</Q> But ere the blow was &s;truck, there ru&s;h'd upon her a young &s;tripling, calling him&s;elf her &s;on, and &s;hewed the dreamer that it was his Je&s;&s;alind.</P>
<P>IN a tumult of di&s;tre&s;s and joy, trembling, yet fevered, the a&s;toni&s;h|ed wanderer awaked, when all was pa&s;t away; and the upri&s;ing &s;un chid his dilatory &s;teps, and gave him
<PB N="134" REF="134">back the pro&s;pect of rude moun|tains, horrid wa&s;tes, and piles of rocks; &s;uch as old chaos formed in &s;portive mood, as monuments of his dreary empire. His amazement en|crea&s;ed, when he beheld the face of nature changed, and, like his dream, the wonderous work of cau&s;es &s;u|pernatural pre&s;enting to him images fanta&s;tical and wild. The hill was rent, and opened to his eye a wind|ing pa&s;&s;age through &s;tupendous rocks, which &s;eemed to prop the azure arch of Heaven. As he pa&s;&s;ed on, within &s;ome little di&s;tance, a
<PB N="135" REF="135">cry&s;tal rill poured its divided &s;treams from high, and trill'd from cliff to cliff around a gaping cavern, which opened its dreary bo&s;om to the view. Led by an impul&s;e irre|&s;i&s;tible, A&s;tianax with virtuous for|titude approached. The onyx &s;hed propitious beams, conducting him through narrow pa&s;&s;es to a &s;pacious cell; who&s;e ample roof, incru&s;ted with variety of minerals, reflected to his eye the blaze of gems innu|merable.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="136">AT a table, form'd of porphyry, cut from the &s;olid ma&s;s whereon it &s;tood, there &s;ate, in meditative po|&s;ture, the figure of a man, as if pre&s;erved by &s;pices and embalming. His long and &s;preading beard, and graceful locks which hung upon his neck, were white, and &s;hone as &s;ilver, as &s;truck by the faint beams of day, which entered &s;ome aper|tures in the roof. A &s;haggy man|tle, the &s;kin of a wild roe, cloathed his &s;houlders; and his jacket was encircled with a leathern girdle. As he reclined his head upon his hand,
<PB N="137" REF="137">one elbow re&s;ted on the table; before him lay a book, an extingui&s;hed lamp, and ro&s;ary; around the cell in&s;truments for a&s;tronomy were &s;cat|tered. In a niche formed in the wall by Nature, &s;tudded and embo&s;s'd with &s;par and &s;pangles, repre&s;enting amethy&s;ts, an empty urn was placed, in&s;cribed, <Q>The du&s;t of Paul Du' Monte.</Q></P>
<P>As A&s;tianax approached, the lu&s;tre of the onyx &s;eemed to blaze upon the effigy, and every limb was agi|tated. A livid lambent flame &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="138" REF="138">all his image, and darted on his eye, like light refracted on the emerald. A voice, as one that &s;pake aloft in air, call'd on A&s;tianax. The voice, the apparition, renewed to him the remembrance of the Her|mit in the wood. Kneeling, he re|plied: <Q>Thou hallowed &s;pirit of my ance&s;tor, for &s;uch thou &s;urely art, here am I; conducted by the hand of Providence, I come to &s;erve thy will, and &s;ee the won|derful accompli&s;hment of thy pre|&s;agings.</Q> The vi&s;ion rai&s;ed his head, and, with extended arm, &s;eem|ed
<PB N="139" REF="139">to demand attention; when a voice was heard to &s;ay: <Q>Here thou &s;halt remain, to &s;erve thy God in prayer and meditation, until the time &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, which hath been written in the book of fate! To delight thy &s;olitary hours, peru&s;e this book; it will enrich thy mind with &s;cience; and, from &s;cience true religion is derived: For, as thou advance&s;t in philo&s;ophy, the growing ideas will enlarge thy knowledge of the Deity, as his wonderous works and attributes are revealed to thy
<PB N="140" REF="140">under&s;tanding. On the day in which thou &s;halt attain the la&s;t of the&s;e few folios, on that day the will of Heaven &s;hall lead thee hence. When thou departe&s;t, carry forth my a&s;hes, and let them re&s;t amid&s;t my ance&s;tors!</Q></P>
<P>As the la&s;t &s;ounds expired, the apparition quivered in each limb; and, as it &s;unk, A&s;tianax &s;natched off his cloak, and, &s;preading it to catch the &s;acred form, received it as it wa&s;ted in a &s;hower of du&s;t. With pious care, he lodged the hallowed
<PB N="141" REF="141">remains within the urn; after re|placing which, bending on one knee, thus he poured forth his prayer: <Q>Holy &s;pirit of Du' Monte, thy prophetic knowledge hitherto foretold the&s;e wonderful events, perceiving, through the cour&s;e of centuries unborn, this pilgrimage of mine! if thou art not enthron|ed in the realms of Heaven, and far ab&s;tracted from all cares for thy po&s;terity, art reigning in the in|effable beatitudes which await thy virtue; but as thou foretold|e&s;t, art a mediating &s;pirit, pre|&s;enting
<PB N="142" REF="142">to the throne of mercy, mens petitions; O bend thy gra|cious care towards my Je&s;&s;alind! May &s;ome benign &s;pirit &s;ave her, and the i&s;&s;ue of our love! And, when thy holy &s;elf &s;hall pay the adoration undefiled, which &s;pirits only know, before the throne of the Divinity; let thy mediating interce&s;&s;ions breathe in Heaven for the&s;e thy kindred! Oh! may &s;he be &s;u&s;tained with &s;ome &s;piritu|al con&s;olation, to reconcile her &s;oul; effacing from her memory, the injuries her ra&s;h Lord hath
<PB N="143" REF="143">done her virtue; and may &s;he conceive, that all the dire events &s;he hath endured, were works conducing unto good, good not revealed, yet ordained in Heaven; and may her bo&s;om entertain a confidence her A&s;tianax &s;urvives.</Q></P>
<P>HE cea&s;ed, and around the grot, innumerable voices, in &s;trains &s;e|raphic, &s;ung an hallelujah! The en|raptured &s;oul of A&s;tianax, amid&s;t the melody, &s;eemed to depart from its impri&s;onment, and quit its mortal &s;en&s;es; ta&s;ting of tran&s;ports far &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing
<PB N="144" REF="144">what in human being &s;he had hitherto experienced. In a lit|tle time he became habituated to his cell: Not far di&s;tant ran the rill, which fill'd his daily cup; the cliffs afforded berry-bearing &s;hrubs and nuts; the &s;hepherds brought him milk of goats; and, facing the &s;un, &s;ome little fertile plots he fill'd with herbs. The plea&s;ing pages of the book of &s;cience occupied the hours, which were &s;pared from his other avocations; and thus he pa&s;s'd a life of fair tranquillity. The evening led him to his peaceful couch, where
<PB N="145" REF="145">fleep was uninterrupted with images ari&s;ing from di&s;tempered nerves, and with the dawn he wakes.</P>
<P>THE prophecy being by tradition handed down among&s;t the &s;hep|herds, the coming of A&s;tianax was &s;oon made known. The &s;trange e|vent brought the a&s;toni&s;h'd people to the cell, to pay him homage as a man divine, and offer gifts. Their pious hands &s;trewed his couch with &s;kins of goats, and cloathed him with garments, &s;uch as their hum|ble life afforded. To them A&s;tianax
<PB N="146" REF="146">ince&s;&s;antly was teaching moral du|ties; and, to their maladies, applied the &s;alutary &s;imples which he culti|vated; thus imitating the excellen|cies of his predece&s;&s;or, and emula|ting all his virtues; and hence, in|&s;piring the minds of his attendants with reverence and love. The &s;ons of the ho&s;pitable &s;hepherd in the vale, from frequent intercour&s;e, ex|periencing the virtues of his &s;oul, as a &s;aint e&s;teemed him. Depending on their fidelity, and recollecting the vi&s;ion which preceded his ap|proach to this his Hermitage, and
<PB N="147" REF="147">which, he apprehended, was de&s;ign|ed to touch his mind with re&s;igna|tion and con&s;olatory hopes, pre&s;a|ging better fate; he often wi&s;h'd to &s;end the young men forth, to gain intelligence, whether his Je&s;&s;alind was yet alive, and what betided the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Du' Monte: But ever, as the wi&s;h grew anxious, the lu&s;tre of the onyx langui&s;hed, and weep'd with blood! The dire appearance was &s;ucceeded by contrition, for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the maxims of his hallowed ance&s;tor; and all the ima|ges which hope or expectation paint|ed
<PB N="148" REF="148">on his mind, quickly were effaced; and his di&s;turbed &s;pirit left the i|deas of the world he wi&s;hed for, and from prayer regained his lo&s;t &s;ere|nity.</P>
<P>ALREADY were fourteen years elap&s;ed in this abode; the book of wi&s;dom yet remained unfini&s;hed, and the late&s;t page of knowledge was far di&s;tant.</P>
<P>ONE morning, after his u&s;ual ado|ration, the &s;ame harmonious voices, which &s;aluted A&s;tianax upon his ar|rival,
<PB N="149" REF="149">with the melody of Heaven, &s;ung a <HI>Te Deum;</HI> and, from the &s;a|cred urn, there blazed a livid flame, which &s;hed the &s;weet perfume of ea&s;tern &s;pices, when con&s;umed in incen&s;e: The gems around the urn reflect the rays, which glowed with beauties like the train of Iris, when &s;he ari&s;es with a ro&s;y toe upon the mountain's top, and rides upon the &s;ummer &s;hower. The book of know|ledge turned as leaves to&s;s'd by the breeze, and &s;hewed this la&s;t mo&s;t &s;acred &s;entence: <Q>The e&s;&s;ence of all human wi&s;dom is religion; in pro&s;|perity,
<PB N="150" REF="150">it guides the giddy &s;pirits to the paths of rectitude; and, in ad|ver&s;ity, it ble&s;&s;eth us with confi|dence in God.</Q></P>
<P>ASTIANAX peru&s;ed the lines; no &s;ooner were they read, than the book clo&s;ed, and to the table became firmly united, part of the very ada|mant it&s;elf. As he &s;ate, his eyes were ca&s;t upon the ground, in medi|tation on the wonders to which he had been witne&s;s; from whence, he was rou&s;ed by the voice of one who called him by his name! As he
<PB N="151" REF="151">looked up, behold, there &s;tood be|fore him, the apparition of his mur|dered friend, of Grinvil! Guilt fill|ed his brea&s;t with horror; in his a&s;toni&s;hment he let go the maxims of the book of knowledge, and cried out: <Q>Am I then &s;ummoned with thee to pa&s;s before the judgement|&s;eat? Will not my contrition ex|piate? Are my prayers unheard, and &s;hall not my &s;oul find mercy?</Q></P>
<P>HE was interrupted by the well|known voice of Grinvil, a&s;&s;uring him, his prayers were heard; that
<PB N="152" REF="152">he, yet living, and recovered of his wound, &s;ought for A&s;tianax in this &s;olitude, to re&s;tore him to the world. A&s;tianax's amazement was encrea|&s;ed! He &s;carce believed his &s;en&s;es! After a few moments, recovering him&s;elf, he aro&s;e to embrace his friend! Grinvil being &s;eated, thus related his &s;tory:</P>
<P><Q>A FEW days being over, after my removal from the bath, my wounds &s;hewed &s;ymptoms flatter|ing with hopes of a recovery; but, as they yet were dangerous,
<PB N="153" REF="153">I was not &s;uffered to be&s;tir my|&s;elf. I improved daily, till at length my &s;kilful &s;urgeon, gave permi&s;&s;ion to return to my own hou&s;e; from whence I &s;ent to make enquiry after A&s;tianax; af|ter Je&s;&s;alind; after Lord Melvil! No intelligence could be gained of you: It was believed you died a &s;uicide, and all enquiry cea&s;ed. Lord Melvil, urged to the pur&s;uit of you, the fugitive, by Father Peter, armed a few dome&s;tics, and ranged the fore&s;ts and the heath, as if he que&s;ted wolves: They
<PB N="154" REF="154">were benighted; and, &s;eeking &s;helter under the cliffs, which &s;tand upon the crown of Mount Avaro:</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>"OF Mount Avaro," cried A&s;ti|anax: <Q>There was I! That was my hiding place! There I &s;u&s;tained a dreadful &s;torm! There the aven|ging elements &s;eemed to pur&s;ue the mi&s;creant!</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>"SEEKING &s;helter in that place," continues Grinvil, <Q>Lord Melvil, with two more, the chiefs of his
<PB N="155" REF="155">dome&s;tics, died, branded by light|ning!</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>ASTIANAX could not forbear to cry aloud, lifting his hands and eyes to Heaven: <Q>How arrogantly blind is &s;inful man, pre&s;uming judge|ment in the darke&s;t of his igno|rance! Surrounded with the ter|rors of the &s;torm, I deemed my|&s;elf the mark for the enraged bolts; the wretch whom ju&s;tice followed, armed with the brands of Heaven: I thought my&s;elf ad|judged to mi&s;ery! when, behold,
<PB N="156" REF="156">the very things which I called wretchedne&s;s, were given me for ble&s;&s;ings! Had morning aro&s;e up|on us, I had fallen by the hands of Melvil; but, preordained for mighty works, here in this moun|tain, the will of Heaven was not to be confounded.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>GRINVIL went on: <Q>Lord Mel|vil's retinue di&s;per&s;ed, terrified and amazed, fled homewards, and left the bodies to the tempe&s;t. Geo|frey, the &s;on and heir of Melvil, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;eigniories.
<PB N="157" REF="157">Geofrey, a youth of high deport|ment, and a haughty &s;pirit, con|temning the bigotry and in&s;olence of churchmen, refu&s;ed to &s;eal the grant of A&s;tianax's e&s;cheated lands to the Benedictine mona&s;tery, in pur&s;uance of the &s;uper&s;titious fol|ly of his father. Polidore, who&s;e treachery was publicly &s;u&s;pected, he who occa&s;ioned all the&s;e dire calamities to your ancient hou&s;e, it was he that named the hour and place, for me to meet him on the fatal day, on a pretended ur|gency of bu&s;ine&s;s. I was a &s;tran|ger
<PB N="158" REF="158">to the time when the virtuous Je&s;&s;alind u&s;ually re&s;orted thither. The plot was wound up with a &s;oldier's re&s;olution, and the &s;ub|tlety of prie&s;ts.&mdash;You know the re&s;t.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>ASTIANAX weep'd with Grinvil.&mdash;</P>
<P>"BUT, as to Polidore," conti|nues Grinvil, <Q>he, wretched man, was &s;oon no more: Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Father Peter's &s;ecrets, the mini&s;ter of an abortive plot, the holy Fa|ther, remaining in the power of
<PB N="159" REF="159">one who&s;e principles were well known to him, and in who&s;e cha|racter at large, he could only place the momentary confidence for an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; he died the death&mdash;in the holy wafer it was admini&s;tered&mdash; He departed from the altar full of health; and, ere it was midnight, he gave up the gho&s;t. Receiving of the &s;acrament in him was &s;a|crilege: By the vengeance of an offended Deity, or by poi&s;on, he was &s;lain.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="160">"BUT what of Je&s;&s;alind," cries A&s;tianax?&mdash;</P>
<P>"OF her," returns Grinvil, <Q>I only heard, that, retiring to the convent where Lucia was Lady Abbe&s;s, in a little time, meeting with &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t, &s;he retired in|to Normandy, where &s;he is living with her father: But whether there is i&s;&s;ue of your love, is yet unknown to me. My coming here (continues he) may &s;eem mi|raculous. I apprehended that, if you could e&s;cape, you would have
<PB N="161" REF="161">fled to Normandy; but the mo|na&s;tic, in Lord Melvil's name, had gained immediate power to &s;earch the ports and pa&s;&s;engers; thence all probability of that at|tempt was void. Fruitle&s;s en|quiries for many years, induced me to believe that thou wert dead; when by accident, as we were hawking in the Mel&s;haw downs, I overtook a &s;hepherd, and his flock, proceeding &s;outhward; I a&s;k'd his way, and whence he came; and finding that of late he journeyed from the mountains,
<PB N="162" REF="162">in a part of Britain where I had never been, curio&s;ity prompted my enquiries. Among&s;t a mul|titude of &s;tories &s;uch ignorant men relate, of wonders which they have heard, I was &s;truck with his de&s;cription of Pengerard, and this Hermitage; but much a&s;to|ni&s;hed, when I heard him relate a wonderful prophecy, which an Hermit, Paul Du' Monte, &s;ome centuries ago, publi&s;hed to the pea&s;ants: And when he told me the&s;e dark &s;ayings were verified, and that the promi&s;ed one was
<PB N="163" REF="163">come; my &s;oul pre&s;aged, that hi|ther you had bent your way, and taken your abode: Thence I de|termined to vi&s;it the place. My anxiety grew every hour upon me, and I was re&s;tle&s;s day and night, until I &s;et forward on my journey.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>"AND you, dear friend," replies A&s;tianax, <Q>bear a great part in the accompli&s;hment of that ancient prophecy.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="164">GRINVIL interrupted him, cry|ing, <Q>Now ha&s;te, my friend, and quit this gloomy cell. The field of honour calls thee to arms: For even now the young Lord Melvil, with his uncles the Lords Selbourn, and Henricks, and a mighty band of great confederates, have ta|ken arms again&s;t our Sovereign, and march their rebel troops to|wards the royal re&s;idence. This is the &s;ea&s;on for thee at once to &s;hew thy loyalty and valour, and claim thy u&s;urped inheritance. Some cho&s;en troops arrive from
<PB N="165" REF="165">Normandy, perhaps with them comes Alfred, Je&s;&s;alind's father, to redre&s;s the injuries of his family. My attendants wait my coming, about ten miles full we&s;t, and with them &s;ome &s;pare &s;teeds well train'd to arms. Ha&s;te to rea&s;&s;ume thy honours.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>THE dream now &s;tood revived upon A&s;tianax's memory, and hope in&s;pired the plea&s;ing images of Je&s;|&s;alind's return: <Q>Were it not for the pious duty,</Q> cries A&s;tianax, <Q>which I owe to the &s;acred memo|ry
<PB N="166" REF="166">of Paul Du' Monte, and to the&s;e his hallowed a&s;hes, I would in&s;tantly accompany my friend towards the field of honour: But the angelic voice of him depart|ed, left me this indi&s;pen&s;able in|junction, <HI>When thou goes hence, carry forth my du&s;t, and let it re&s;t amid&s;t my ance&s;tors!</HI> Fir&s;t per|mit me to fulfil his la&s;t reque&s;t, committed to me from the regions of &s;pirits.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>GRINVIL was &s;ilent.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="167">AFTER &s;ome little preparations, they left the Hermitage, A&s;tianax in his arms bearing the urn; thus journeying until they reached the re|tinue, which waited Grinvil's return. As they pa&s;s'd on, towards night they gained a village. A&s;tianax re|tired to the church, and, on the al|tar, placed the &s;acred urn; then pro&s;trate he poured forth his thank&s;|giving to that bounteous Providence which had pre&s;erved him thus mi|raculou&s;ly. From hence he retired, leaving the a&s;hes of Paul Du' Monte till morning.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="168">EARLY as day break, A&s;tianax a|gain approached the altar; with re|verence he laid his hands upon the urn, to bear it on his journey; but it was &s;ix'd immoveable! Amid&s;t his a&s;toni&s;hment, he heard a voice, commanding him to leave the a&s;hes there at re&s;t, till peace was in the land. With pious re&s;ignation he o|beyed, and retiring, informed his friend, that he was now at liberty to accompany him to the &s;eat of war. He quitted the Hermit's garb, and, from his beard, which reached his girdle, formed his countenance into

On his helmet plumes of &s;carlet waved, and, at his thigh, a &s;cimitar &s;u&s;pended in a belt of gold embroidery, blazed with precious &s;tones! He graciou&s;ly re|ceived the vi&s;iters, retained them with their retinue in his corps, and &s;ate them one on each hand to at|tend

The news brought by the &s;couts and &s;pies related, that the royal army was moving towards the rebels, which &s;hewed that the battle was not far off. After a farewel re|pa&s;t, it was re&s;olved to march and join the royal &s;tandard.

The King commanded in per&s;on, and to the royal tent the allies being intro|duced, were &s;tationed in the right wing of the army. No Norman troops were in the field, detained by adver&s;e winds, they had not di&s;|embarked. Orders were i&s;&s;ued for the next day's attack, and all the

But Pro|vidence permits the&s;e errors of mankind, and perhaps permits them in compa&s;&s;ion to the dying! For man, in this e&s;tate, is on a pilgrimage from birth to death!

<P>EARLY as the dawn, the royal ar|my takes the field, and heralds pa&s;s, to call the foe to battle. The rebels, waiting for a tardy reinforcement, loiter in their entrenchments; till braved by the left wing, who &s;eize the outward works, and &s;hower their arrows on the foe; impatient
<PB N="197" REF="197">in their re&s;traint, receiving unreta|liated wounds, they leap the trench. Lord Melvil, with the confederate chiefs, perceive their ra&s;hne&s;s, and compelled with their main army to &s;u&s;tain them, the battle becomes general. A&s;tianax, with Grinvil, fought &s;ide by &s;ide. A&s;tianax's ar|mour turned a&s;ide the javelin and arrow; and the proved falchion made no impre&s;&s;ion on his coat of mail! Grinvil did wonders! His charge was rapid as the lightning, and thought it&s;elf could not out&s;trip his guard! At length, his javelin was
<PB N="198" REF="198">&s;hiver'd in the a&s;&s;ault, and, to his tru&s;ty &s;word, he yielded all his va|lour! Long he fought, and van|qui&s;h'd every oppre&s;&s;ing foe! But fate had wrote his doom; and he receiv'd an arrow through the plaits of his cuira&s;s, a &s;lant way &s;hot, which pierced him underneath the arm, and rendered his &s;word no longer &s;erviceable: He was compelled to retreat; and, meeting A&s;tianax, who &s;laughtered like a pe&s;tilence, and cut his pa&s;&s;age through the ranks where|ever he a&s;&s;aulted; he, &s;eeing his friend was wounded, forebore the
<PB N="199" REF="199">havock, and retired to guard him to &s;ome &s;afer &s;pot, where the &s;ur|geons might withdraw the barb, and dre&s;s the wound. His friendly office once accompli&s;hed, A&s;tianax flew back to join the battle. Pro|vidence ordained, that he &s;hould fill the mo&s;t momentuous in&s;tant! The King, from his ra&s;h ardour, ru&s;hing too far, became encircled by a troop of choice&s;t foes; &s;u&s;tained only by a few, who, overpowered, were fall|ing round him, had already thought him&s;elf a pri&s;oner; when, to the victorious phalanx, A&s;tianax pu&s;h'd
<PB N="200" REF="200">on his &s;teed: He fretted on the bit, and &s;nuff'd the air impatiently, as con&s;cious of the glory he &s;hould win. The crucifix upon A&s;tianax's bo&s;om blazed like a pa&s;&s;ing comet, and be|dim'd the gazers eye! De&s;truction rode on every &s;ide, and gave him pa&s;&s;age. The royal arm, the rebel hand had that in&s;tant re&s;ted; that in&s;tant to A&s;tianax's falchion fell the &s;acrilegious hand, and &s;corn'd the mi&s;erable wretch who had abu&s;ed its valour! Courage revived within the rallying guard! In the right wing, the cry of victory re&s;ounded!
<PB N="201" REF="201">The centre pu&s;hes on, and joins the King. The rebels, from de&s;pair, now fought with madne&s;s!</P>
<P>ASTIANAX was foremo&s;t in the field for deeds of valour! One com|petitor alone fought for the King, and almo&s;t equal'd the hero in his claim for glory! Mounted on a dappled roan, a gallant &s;teed, that to&s;s'd his &s;ilver main aloft in air, a young man braved the greate&s;t ter|rors of the war! The red teints on his hor&s;e's glo&s;&s;y &s;kin, &s;eem'd like a &s;hower of blood! A crim&s;on plume
<PB N="202" REF="202">covered his helmet, and crim&s;on ribbons bound his armour: Amid&s;t the carnage of his &s;word, he was known only by the name of the Bloody Knight! Where'er the foes ru&s;h'd on, and gained upon the roy|al troops, there he attacked! and, when the fury of the de&s;pairing re|bels made the battle the mo&s;t &s;an|guine, then, amid&s;t the ranks, he forced his way, and, meeting with Lord Melvil, braved him to engage; unhors'd him, and, amid&s;t his a|mazed va&s;&s;als, &s;evered his head from off his body; and bore it by the
<PB N="203" REF="203">hair aloft to view! The &s;pectacle di&s;mayed the rebel troops;&mdash;they fled!&mdash;Whil&s;t he approach'd the King, and made the offering which en&s;ured the peace! The rout was general!</P>
<P>THE King &s;ent forth an herald through his army, commanding the two valiant &s;trangers to attend him in his tent. The Bloody Knight o|beyed the &s;ummons; but A&s;tianax had left the field, to vi&s;it his friend: Grinvil was &s;till alive, but langui&s;h'd in his wound, which then portend|ed
<PB N="204" REF="204">inevitable death. He received A&s;tianax, and heard his de&s;cription of the battle, with a &s;mile. Amid&s;t the circum&s;tances of the fight, the Bloody Knight engaged A&s;tianax's wonder and applau&s;e: He dwelt upon his valour with a partial plea|&s;ure: "But," cries he, <Q>what mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hes, is the device he wore upon his &s;hield; he bare a lion ar|gent on a bloody field, &s;upported on a ri&s;ing golden &s;un; the coat of the Du' Montes.</Q>&mdash;Grinvil in|terrupts: <Q>Could this be a &s;on of thine, my friend!</Q> <Q>Oh! flatter|ing
<PB N="205" REF="205">thought,</Q> replies A&s;tianax, <Q>but empty and delu&s;ive! Had he been my &s;on, he would have quartered Alfred's arms; that &s;trange device, a &s;avage tearing up a pine. But now, my friend, (&s;ays A&s;tianax), let me conduct you to the neighbouring town, where you may re&s;t commodiou&s;|ly, and have the able&s;t &s;urgeons in the army to attend your wound. From thence, I will immediately repair to execute the will of Paul Du' Monte; and, when the pi|ous office is accompli&s;hed, I will
<PB N="206" REF="206">approach the King, and &s;eek, as a reward, the re&s;titution of my lands.</Q></P>
<P>BEFORE A&s;tianax departed from his friend, Grinvil, apprehen&s;ive of the approach of death, thus ad|dre&s;s'd him: <Q>Oh! A&s;tianax, my friend, my kin&s;man; if thou feel|e&s;t affection for me, remember my dear Livia, my &s;i&s;ter. The fates decree a period to thy &s;orrows: The happy days approach, in which thy toils and &s;ufferings will end. Then think of me. To thy
<PB N="207" REF="207">care, I give the beauteous maid. She will inherit all my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and, with that &s;ufficiency, will di&s;play the bright, the illu&s;trious excellencies of her &s;oul. For &s;he hath virtues which &s;urpa&s;s mo&s;t of her &s;ex. Then A&s;tianax:</Q>&mdash; He pau&s;ed.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>What would my friend require of me?</Q> cries A&s;tianax.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>If thou ha&s;t a &s;on, O let her a&s;ylum be thy regard.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="208">AFTER the&s;e words, the friends both remained &s;ilent. A&s;tianax re|lieved the anxious moment of deep thought, and, cla&s;ping his friend's hand, a&s;&s;ured him of his protection of the fair Livia: <Q>Whatever be my fate,</Q> adds he, <Q>&s;he &s;hall be as a daughter to me.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>GRINVIL returned his friend&s;hip with tears, and, on his hand, im|printed ki&s;&s;es. Alas! the la&s;t im|printed ki&s;&s;es of his life! The&s;e faithful friends embraced, and bid adieu!</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="209">ASTIANAX ha&s;ted to the village where the &s;acred a&s;hes of his ance&s;|tor were re&s;ted. The King, after publi&s;hing a general pardon to the rebels who came in and &s;wore alle|giance, di&s;per&s;ed his army, and re|moved his court to York.</P>
<P>LORD Morton, who was a favour|ite with the King, was of a &s;oul bene|volent, as exalted with &s;cience. He rejoiced in rewarding virtue, where|&s;oever he di&s;covered it. The valour of the Bloody Knight had fired his mind with admiration and e&s;teem.

By my father's &s;ide, I am a lineal de&s;cendant of the Duke of Belfort, who&s;e honours and domains were granted by the Norman William, for his valiant &s;ervices. In a &s;ucceeding reign, Lord Alexander giving di&s;plea&s;ure to the King, in not coinciding in
<PB N="212" REF="212">&s;ome pernicious mea&s;ures, was be|trayed by a &s;ervile mini&s;ter, to gra|tify the royal re&s;entment; was im|peached, and, with his head, lo&s;t the va&s;t territories, and the title of his ance&s;tors. Lord Alexander had a younger brother, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed an ample fortune, and was owner of an e&s;tate and man&s;ion, which, from his family name, was called Du' Monte. This e&s;tate de&s;cended to my father; but, from the malevolence and avarice of a crafty prie&s;t, the principal of the Benedictine mona&s;tery; and,
<PB N="213" REF="213">from his own youthful impetuo|&s;ity, he entertained a groundle&s;s jealou&s;y again&s;t my mother; and, &s;eeking revenge for his mi&s;taken wrongs, he &s;lew his kin&s;man Grin|vil; a man of &s;potle&s;s fame; and with my mother innocent of the alledged crime. Lord Melvil ha|ving the &s;eigniory, &s;eized the lands. My father fled, and died an ob&s;cure death. My mother, then pregnant with me, retired into a convent, where a relation was the Abbe&s;s. My father's e&s;tates were to be granted by Lord Melvil to
<PB N="214" REF="214">the mona&s;tery of St Benedict, in con&s;equence of a vow extorted from the terrors of his troubled con&s;cience. The principal of the mona&s;tery had concerted the hor|rid plot; all the treachery flowed from him; and Lord Melvil's bigotry was to have rewarded the crime. As Providence directed, the grant remained un&s;ealed, when a &s;udden death took off Lord Mel|vil. The di&s;appointment drove the monk to madne&s;s: For many years a raving horror harrowed up his &s;oul; and, in his malady,
<PB N="215" REF="215">the mo&s;t di&s;tracting de&s;peration wore down his carca&s;s to the grave. My mother, overwhelmed with her di&s;tre&s;&s;es, would have re|mained among&s;t the nuns, had not my approaching birth obliged her to retire into the arms of Alfred. Soon after her arrival in Norman|dy, I was born. I was named Leo Du' Monte. From my in|fancy, my con&s;tant re&s;idence has been with my grandfather; till the rumour of this in&s;urrection induced me to take up arms, and &s;eek for honour, under the Briti&s;h
<PB N="216" REF="216">&s;tandard. My mother would at|tend me, determining, if I &s;hould fall in battle, that &s;he would re|tire into a convent. Adver&s;e winds &s;eparated the little fleet in which we &s;ailed, with &s;ome few Norman troops. My mother, with her attendants, were drove back, whil&s;t the bark in which I &s;ailed, fortunately made land. The hand of Heaven &s;u&s;tained me in the bat|tle; and, from the royal bounty, with Lord Morton's influence, I doubt not but I &s;hall regain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of my father. But, be
<PB N="217" REF="217">that as it proves, I think my&s;elf fortunate, that ju&s;tice wielded my &s;word, and young Lord Melvil fell beneath my arm!</Q></P>
<P>LORD Morton found him&s;elf greatly intere&s;ted in the young champion's hi&s;tory; and, during the relation, his regard for virtue moved his re&s;olves. At length, they prepare to attend the court: Lord Morton introduced the valiant Leo, having related to the King in his clo&s;et, the hero's hi&s;tory. The e&s;|&s;ential &s;ervices he had rendered the
<PB N="218" REF="218">&s;tate, together with the interce&s;&s;ions of Lord Morton, for who&s;e great power and good offices, he was not to depart the throne di&s;&s;atisfied; in|duced the King, of his royal muni|ficence, to re&s;tore to Leo Du' Monte, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his ance&s;tors, and the title of the Duke of Belfort.</P>
<P>WHILST the&s;e tran&s;actions were pa&s;&s;ing, A&s;tianax having reach'd the church where the hallowed du&s;t of Paul Du' Monte was depo&s;ited. On his knees, before the altar, he re|a&s;&s;umed his pious duty; and, in
<PB N="219" REF="219">&s;low journeyings, bearing the urn, he bent his way over the heights, the neare&s;t pa&s;&s;age to the man&s;ion of Du' Monte.</P>
<P>GRINVIL's wound, beyond the power of &s;urgery, proved mortal; and he &s;lept with his ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>ASTIANAX, in his way, pa&s;&s;ing over mountains, de&s;erts, and dreary wilds; one day, towards evening, found him&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed by a ha|&s;ty river, which &s;hewed no tokens of its being pa&s;&s;able, until the flood
<PB N="220" REF="220">&s;ub&s;ided, which had &s;welled the &s;tream. He &s;tood upon the banks for &s;ome time irre&s;olute whether to pur&s;ue the current: The noi&s;e of water-falls &s;truck his ear, he follow|ed the &s;ound, and entered into a bay, formed by nature, of &s;tupen|dous rocks. The night drew on. In this &s;ecure rece&s;s he determined to remain till morning: His &s;er|vants pitched their tents upon the hill. The novelty of the &s;cene af|forded him delight; the high cliffs under which he &s;at, were porphyry; the apertures every where were
<PB N="221" REF="221">grown with &s;hrubs; and, on the brow, rude oaks extend their old mi&s;hapen arms over the bay, and form'd a lofty &s;hade. The con|tinued rocks enclo&s;e a &s;pacious am|phitheatre, in &s;ome parts, &s;tanding erect like ma&s;&s;ive pillars; in others, &s;haken and irregular, as rude as na|tive chaos; tremendou&s;ly &s;u&s;pended o'er their ba&s;e and threatning in|&s;tantaneous wreck. Here and there the &s;able yews cling on the cliffs, and, o'er the precipice, the trunks of &s;torm-torn trees hang woven round with ivy, who&s;e fanta&s;tic branches
<PB N="222" REF="222">play pendulant on every gale. In the centre of this rocky circle, &s;tands, divided from the re&s;t, a mighty pile, bearing the image of &s;ome fortre&s;s; on either &s;ide of which, a foaming torrent, the whole river's flood, falls down precipitate an hundred fa|thom. The &s;ounding waters eddy in the deep and di&s;mal gulph be|low, where, hem'd by many a rug|ged rock, the giddy &s;treams la&s;h, foam, and twi&s;t, and bu&s;tle on their voyage. The ear a&s;toni&s;h'd, admits no other &s;ound, but the uproar of the impetuous water God, who bel|lowed
<PB N="223" REF="223">in the lake his ha&s;ty laws to the a&s;toni&s;hed &s;treams. So Vulcan's voice re&s;ounded in the noi&s;y forges of the Cyclops.</P>
<P>As night advances forth from the chambers of the ea&s;t, the moon a&s;|cends, and &s;ilvers the light vapour. And now &s;urmounting every &s;hade, rufulgent rides the azure firma|ment. In her fair a&s;pect, meekne&s;s &s;eems to reign in regions of tran|quillity: So con&s;cious virtue &s;miles within a &s;oul &s;erene: Her counte|nance, like fair content, diffu&s;es

A&s;tia|nax here &s;eated, in his mind revolves the various changes of his life, the darkne&s;s of futurity, the ob&s;cure meaning of the prophecy, the im|probability of his re&s;toration to the honours of his family, at the time when the a&s;hes of Paul Du' Monte &s;hould re&s;t in the tomb of his an|ce&s;tors.</P>

With eyes which &s;eem'd to weep the pure&s;t cry&s;tal, &s;tood Treachery transformed to &s;tone, and petrified with her own tears. Ava|rice &s;tood oppo&s;ite, a haggard form extending withered arms, and gra&s;p|ing at the air. Beneath their feet, pale Envy &s;hewed her &s;ickly face, and drew along her &s;qualid form, that lengthened out a crawling nau&s;eous &s;erpent. Deep in the hor|rid
<PB N="228" REF="228">whirlpool roll'd in torture; Super&s;tition, over who&s;e head the cataract, ince&s;&s;antly poured down its filthy torrent, &s;tained with the blood of martyrs and of ma&s;&s;acres, and polluted with the &s;ins of ages. Whil&s;t bending o'er the brink, be|hold Hypocri&s;y pregnant with mon|&s;ters, who, in their birth, torture and revile the agonizing demon in the lake.

<P>THE morning wakes A&s;tianax with her ro&s;y finger: The &s;un &s;ur|mounts the horizon: The&s;e vi&s;ions were e&s;teemed, in his interpretation, as the revelation of his concluded &s;orrows; as his former dream pre|&s;aged the progre&s;s of his redemption from the dreary &s;olitude of Mount Pengerard.

Through this lucid portico he pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;oon arrived in a cultivated country, where open roads rendered his journey expeditious. His labours drew towards their conclu&s;ion. He reach'd the well known valley, where &s;tood the man&s;ion of Du' Monte! Alas! how changed! The

The woods, the groves, the old patrician oaks, which once had graced the man|&s;ion of his father; and had enjoyed two centuries and more, of far ex|tended wealth and &s;plendour, were no more! The fatal hand of De&s;o|lation had laid low the long &s;tretch|ed avenue! and one confu&s;ed ruin mark'd the &s;pot where once the

At his approach, the doors which had remained &s;hut up for years, as if &s;hook by tempe&s;ts, &s;pontaneou&s;ly gave way! He gains the gallery!

<P>ASTIANAX, gazing upon the vi|&s;ion, breathed this &s;hort ejaculation: <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit of the mighty Nor|ban, have the labours of A&s;tianax gained thy approbation?

The heavy gates which clo&s;ed the cell, moved &s;tiff! The har&s;h &s;ounds wind along the wide extend|ed arches! The repo&s;itory of the ancient family of Du' Montes, was revealed to the &s;pectators; where,

Above were placed the effigies and arms; by time and damp, cloathed with a &s;able veil, in mournful order, pointing out the long &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of the &s;poil of death.

<P><PB N="237" REF="237">WITH down ca&s;t eyes A&s;tianax pa&s;s'd on, and, in its proper cell, depo&s;ited the remains of Paul Du' Monte, and hung aloft the arms of Norban: Then, bending to the earth, he cries aloud:</P>
<P><Q>YE &s;acred manes of my father, ye &s;pirits of my ance&s;tors, hal|lowed be ye in Heaven! If ye regard the affairs of your po&s;teri|ty, accept this filial duty; and, in your prayers to the Omnipo|tent, for us and our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in|tercede! Pray that we, perceiving

And, when thou would&s;t that we &s;hould pray, correct the blindne&s;s of our wi&s;hes with propriety, and let our petitions become acceptable; and may our &s;upplications, dive&s;t|ed of all arrogance, be an&s;wered with thy paternal love. Extend unto us, Lord, the gift of grace; &s;u&s;tain us in the hour of mortal woe; and, when this expiring frame &s;hall &s;ink to re&s;t on the ma|ternal

<P>THEN, rai&s;ing him&s;elf from off the earth, he cries: <Q>Heaven's will be done.</Q> Straight was heard cele&s;tial melody which fill'd the air; the voices of a multitude of chaun|ters &s;inging to the harp, and pro|nouncing: <Q>Prai&s;ed be thy name, O Lord, for all thy mercies &s;hewn to man on earth, of whom thou
<PB N="242" REF="242">take&s;t &s;uch abundant care, and un|to angels de&s;igns to equal them.</Q></P>
<P>AMIDST the hallelujah, and the chorus, A&s;tianax lifted up his face, and, to the &s;train, accompanied his voice. Forth from the urn a livid lambent flame aro&s;e, which &s;hot its quivering point aloft, and fill'd the vault with fragrance. On the brea&s;t of A&s;tianax, the onyx &s;pread a blaze of light, &s;uch as &s;urrounded the heavenly form of Gabriel, when &s;ped to earth on errands of divine import, to patriarchs of old.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="243">OVER the urn two cherubs, with their lucid pinions, hovered; and, catching the a&s;cending flame, wafted it to Heaven: Whil&s;t all a|bove, the choir of aereal voices, with the &s;ounds of many trumpets, &s;ung his <HI>requiem.</HI></P>
<P>AT the opening of the vault, there appeared a youth of noble port, in rich apparel, with a croud of gay attendants. Silent, and in a&s;toni&s;h|ment, he &s;tood, with projected fi|gure and extended hands, now ga|zing on A&s;tianax, then on the urn,
<PB N="244" REF="244">devouring every &s;entence! The vul|gar, all behind, trembling at the&s;e miraculous events, &s;tood mute in reverence!

<P>As A&s;tianax, with the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, departed the vault, he ob&s;erved a per&s;on entering the church, attended by a mighty croud of men, in who&s;e countenances &s;at fe&s;tivity and joy.
<PB N="245" REF="245">The aereal melody, as if &s;u&s;pended on the breeze, gradually departed, and the di&s;tant and decrea&s;ing &s;ounds, &s;lowly died upon the ear.</P>
<P>ON nearer approach, Lord Albon, who led the jocund band, recollected A&s;tianax to be the knight who had accompanied him to the war; and A&s;tianax immediately knew his no|ble ho&s;t. They approach to &s;alute each other: The rays of the onyx confounded Lord Albon; they were too radiant for his eye to gaze on! He &s;topt&mdash;He thought he &s;aw the
<PB N="246" REF="246">&s;pirit of his friend, deck'd in ange|lic lu&s;tre! But A&s;tianax relieved his confu&s;ion; and cries out: <Q>My noble Lord, this meeting affords me in|finite delight. My pilgrimage is ended: My vow is fulfiled: Be|hold, I have borne the a&s;hes of the Hermit, Paul Du' Monte, to this their re&s;ting place! And, my Lord, the will of Providence &s;ends forth unhop'd for circum&s;tances to aid the completion of the prophecy.

<P>THEY &s;alute the &s;tranger youth; the &s;tranger youth returns the bow; and was about to inquire in who&s;e pre&s;ence it was he &s;tood; but thus Lord Albon interrupts:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>AND you, my valiant knight, (&s;ays he, to A&s;tianax), from who&s;e pui&s;&s;ant &s;word &s;uch havock fell; &s;uch noble deeds of arms! You came, as &s;ent by Heaven, on this

I took her from a band of ruffians, who guarded her, and a train of impious eccle&s;ia&s;tics, by whom &s;he was accompanied; bearing the &s;hrine and relicks of St Benedict, in &s;upplications for their Sovereign's overthrow! She would conceal her real character; and &s;ays, that in the perils of the day, as &s;he advanced towards the

From the humour of the female mind, which human wi&s;dom ne|ver could decypher, no other place mu&s;t witne&s;s to our vows but this!

<P><PB N="250" REF="250">AT that in&s;tant, a troop of ladies entered; as they advanced, A&s;tianax thought he recollected her, who, hand in hand, came with the per&s;on dre&s;&s;ed in bridal robes! A young maid of excellent beauty! As near|er they approach, he perceived &s;he was the fair Livia, the &s;i&s;ter of his departed friend! The dying petition of Grinvil renewed upon his memo|ry! He recollected, that un&s;earch|able are the &s;ecret paths thro' which Providence brings on the decrees of Heaven; and he already apprehend|ed,

<P>THE bride, with collected re&s;o|lution, at length looks up. Her looks &s;truck on A&s;tianax, the lu&s;tre of who&s;e amulet had reach'd her eye! She &s;tarted! &s;tretch'd her arms to catch a&s;&s;i&s;tance! &s;hriek'd and fell! And, as &s;he fell, from her fair hand there drop'd a dagger, which &s;he had concealed, to prevent the odi|ous e&s;pou&s;al! Odious, as contrary to inclination!</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="253">THE congregation were filled with a&s;toni&s;hment! Lord Albon trembled! All but A&s;tianax, and the young &s;tranger, were &s;truck with horror!

Are we in the regions of death? or are we &s;till on earth? A&s;toni&s;h|ment! yet an a&s;toni&s;hment of heavenly import.</Q></P>
<P>LORD Albon thought him&s;elf abu|&s;ed, and called to his attendants for his &s;word: "Here are tricks," cries
<PB N="255" REF="255">he, <Q>and &s;ubtleties, and holy frauds, which interpo&s;e between me and my purpo&s;e, and would deprive me of my bridal joys. This pi|ous knave, who, in his treachery, u&s;urps a hu&s;band's title, &s;hall be the fir&s;t to feel my indignation! Here, my &s;word! Va&s;&s;als, my &s;word!</Q> He gra&s;p'd A&s;tianax by the collar!</P>
<P>THE in&s;tant he laid his hands up|on him, a dreadful clap of thunder bur&s;t above their heads! The air was red with lightning! The church
<PB N="256" REF="256">rock'd on its pillars: <Q>Demons, I defy you,</Q> cries the enraged Lord: <Q>All, all the tricks of this magician! all his &s;orceries!</Q></P>
<P>THE &s;urpri&s;e and terror again threw Je&s;&s;alind into great emotions. She fell upon the bo&s;om of the young &s;tranger, and wept! The youth &s;tretched forth his hand, entreating Lord Albon to &s;u&s;pend his anger, until the&s;e wonderful circum&s;tances were explained; a&s;&s;uring him, that the intended bride was his mother; and craving her to decypher the remaining my&s;teries.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="257">THE explanation &s;oon was given. Lord Albon's rage &s;ub&s;ided: He was convinced this was more than artifice; and, correcting impa&s;&s;ion|ed wi&s;hes with propriety of judge|ment, his excellencies of &s;oul were renewed in all their benevolence and honour. He join'd the hands of A&s;tianax and Je&s;&s;alind!</P>
<P>THE youth kneeling, implanted ki&s;&s;es on the hands united: <Q>Fa|ther,</Q> cries he, <Q>ble&s;s me with your pardon; ignorant that you &s;till lived, I have abu&s;ed the boun|ty of the throne; I have u&s;urp'd
<PB N="258" REF="258">the name of Belfort! This ducal title, the&s;e e&s;tates, the&s;e honours, they appertain to you; and at your feet I here re&s;ign them! I will immediately pre&s;ent my pe|tition to the crown, for their re|moval.</Q></P>
<P>ASTIANAX rai&s;ing him, cla&s;p'd him to his enraptured bo&s;om: "En|joy thy honours, worthy youth!" cries he, <Q>Enjoy the rewards of thy valour, and thy virtue! The man&s;ion of Du' Monte, and the&s;e demains, are all I ever wi&s;h'd for, or will po&s;&s;e&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="259">JESSALIND relieved her &s;on from A&s;tianax's embrace; and, on her neck, received his tears of tran|&s;port!</P>
<P>THE general confu&s;ion &s;tood be|calm'd in general a&s;toni&s;hment and joy!</P>
<P>LORD Albon thus addre&s;&s;ed them: <Q>Above the &s;elfi&s;h &s;entiments of partiality for my own happine&s;s, &s;incere joy fills all my &s;oul for your re&s;tored felicity, and your rewarded merit. And you, Lord
<PB N="260" REF="260">Belfort, full of valour, and warm with principles of honour; go on and &s;corn the little gains of &s;elf|enjoyment, when an emulation of the God, who&s;e image it is you wear, prompts to the exerci&s;e of virtues, in the field of life. For in virtue only true nobility con|&s;i&s;ts, and &s;elf approving con&s;cience calls it happine&s;s.</Q></P>
