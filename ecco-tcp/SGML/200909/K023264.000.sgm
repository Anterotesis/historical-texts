<HEAD>TO Mr. SECRETARY DUNDAS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>June</HI> 6, 1792.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS you opened the debate in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, May 25th, on the Proclamation for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Publications, which that Proclamation (without naming any) calls wicked and &s;editious, and as you applied tho&s;e opprobious epithets to the works entitled "RIGHTS OF MAN," I think it unnece&s;&s;ary to offer any other rea&s;on for addre&s;&s;ing this Letter to you.</P>
<P>I begin, then, at once, by declaring that I do not believe there are to be found in the writings of any author, ancient or modern, on the &s;ubject of Government, a &s;pirit of greater benignity, and a &s;tronger inculcation of moral principles than in
<PB N="4" REF="3">tho&s;e which I have publi&s;hed. They come, Sir, from a man, who, by having lived in different countries, and under different &s;y&s;tems of Govern|ment, and who, being intimate in the con&s;truc|tion of them, is a better judge of the &s;ubject than it is po&s;&s;ible that you, from the want of tho&s;e op|portunities, can be:&mdash;And, be&s;ides this, they come from an heart that knows not how to beguile.</P>
<P>I will further &s;ay, that when that moment ar|rives in which the be&s;t con&s;olation that &s;hall be left will be that of looking back on &s;ome pa&s;t actions, more virtuous, more meritorious, than the re&s;t, I &s;hall then with happine&s;s remember, among other things, I have written the RIGHTS OF MAN.&mdash; As to what Proclamations, or Pro&s;ecutions, or Place-men, or place-expectants&mdash;tho&s;e who po&s;|&s;e&s;s, or tho&s;e who are gaping for office, may &s;ay or them, it will not alter their character, either with the world or with me.</P>
<P>Having, Sir, made this declaration, I &s;hall pro|ceed to remark, not particularly upon your own Speech on that occa&s;ion, but on any other Speech to which your Motion on that day gave ri&s;e; and I &s;hall begin with that of Mr. ADAM.</P>
<P>This Gentleman accu&s;es me of <HI>not</HI> having done the very thing that <HI>I have done,</HI> and which, he &s;ays, if I <HI>had</HI> done, he &s;hould not have accu&s;ed me.</P>
<P>Mr. ADAM, in his Speech, (&s;ee the Morning Chronicle of May 26,) &s;ays, <Q>That he had well
<PB N="5" REF="4">con&s;idered the &s;ubject of Con&s;titutional Publi|cations, and was by no means ready to &s;ay (but the contrary) that books of &s;cience upon Go|vernment, though recommending a doctrine or &s;y&s;tem different from the form of our Con&s;titu|tion, (meaning that of England) were fit objects of pro&s;ecution; that if he did, he mu&s;t condemn (which he meant not to do) HARRINGTON for his Oceana, SIR THOMAS MORE for his Eu|topia, and HUME for his idea of a perfect Com|mon-wealth. But, (continued Mr. Adam,) the Publication of Mr. PAINE was very different; for it reviled what was <HI>mo&s;t &s;acred</HI> in the Con|&s;titution, de&s;troyed every principle of &s;ubordi|nation, and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed nothing in their room.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I readily perceive that Mr. ADAM had not read the <HI>Second</HI> Part of the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and I am put under the nece&s;&s;ity, either of &s;ubmitting to an er|roneous charge, or of ju&s;tifying my&s;elf again&s;t it; and I certainly &s;hall prefer the latter.&mdash;If, then, I &s;hall prove to Mr. ADAM, that, in my rea&s;oning upon Sy&s;tems of Government in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> I have &s;hewn as clearly, I think, as words can convey ideas, a certain &s;y&s;tem of Go|vernment; and that not exi&s;ting in theory only, but already in full and e&s;tabli&s;hed practice, and &s;y&s;tematically and practically free from all the vices and defects of the Engli&s;h Government, and capa|ble of producing more happine&s;s to the People,
<PB N="6" REF="5">and that al&s;o with an eightieth part of the Taxes, which the pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem of Engli&s;h Government con&s;umes; I hope he will do me the ju&s;tice when he next goes to the Hou&s;e, to get up and confe&s;s he had been mi&s;taken in &s;aying, that I had <HI>e&s;ta|bli&s;hed nothing, and that I had de&s;troyed every princi|ple of &s;ubordination.</HI> Having thus opened the ca&s;e, I now come to the point.</P>
<P>In the Second Part of RIGHTS OF MAN, I have di&s;tingui&s;hed Government into two cla&s;&s;es or &s;y&s;tems; the one the hereditary &s;y&s;tem; the other the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In the Fir&s;t Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> I have en|deavoured to &s;hew, and I challenge any man to refute it, that there does not exi&s;t a right to e&s;ta|bli&s;h Hereditary Government; or, in other words, Hereditary Governors; becau&s;e Hereditary Go|vernment always means a Government yet to come, and the ca&s;e always is, that the People who are to live afterwards, have always the &s;ame right to chu&s;e a Government for them&s;elves, as the peo|had who lived before them.</P>
<P>In the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> I have not repeated tho&s;e arguments, becau&s;e they are irrefutable; but have confined my&s;elf to &s;hew the defects of what is called Hereditary Government, or Hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion; that it mu&s;t, from the nature of it, throw Government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it, from want of prin|ciple,
<PB N="7" REF="6">or unfitted for it from want of capacity.&mdash; James the IId is recorded as an in&s;tance of the fir&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;es; and in&s;tances are to be found almo&s;t all over Europe to prove the truth of the latter.</P>
<P>To &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of the Hereditary Sy&s;tem &s;till more &s;trongly, I will now put the following ca&s;e:&mdash;Take any fifty men promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and it will be very extraordinary, if out of that number, one man &s;hould be found, who&s;e principles and talents taken together, (for &s;ome might have prin|ciples, and others have talents) would render him a per&s;on truly fitted to fill any very extraordinary office of National Tru&s;t. If, then, &s;uch a fitne&s;s of character could not be expected to be found in more than one per&s;on out of fifty, it would happen but once in a thou&s;and years to the elde&s;t &s;on of any one family, admitting each, on an average, to hold the office twenty years. Mr. Adam talks of &s;omething in the Con&s;titution which he calls <HI>mo&s;t &s;acred;</HI> but I hope he does not mean hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, a thing which appears to me a violation of every order of nature, and of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>When I look into Hi&s;tory and &s;ee the multitudes of men, otherwi&s;e virtuous, who have died, and their families been ruined, in defence of knaves and fools, and which they would not have done, had they rea&s;oned at all upon the &s;y&s;tem; I do not know a greater good that an individual can render to mankind, than to endeavour to
<PB N="8" REF="7">break the chains of political &s;uper&s;tition. Tho&s;e chains are now di&s;&s;olving fa&s;t, and proclamations and pro&s;ecutions will &s;erve but to ha&s;ten that di&s;|&s;olution.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;poken of the Hereditary Sy&s;tem as a bad &s;y&s;tem, and &s;ubject to every po&s;&s;ible defect; I now come to the Repre&s;entative Sy&s;tem; and this Mr. ADAM will find &s;tated in the Second Part of Rights of Man, not only as the be&s;t, but as the only <HI>Theory</HI> of Government under which the li|berties of a people can be permanently &s;ecure.</P>
<P>But it is needle&s;s now to talk of mere Theory, &s;ince there is already a Government in full prac|tice, e&s;tabli&s;hed upon that Theory, or in other words, upon the Rights of Man, and has been &s;o for almo&s;t twenty years. Mr. Pitt, in a &s;peech of his &s;ome &s;hort time &s;ince, &s;aid, <Q>That there never did, and never could exi&s;t a Government e&s;ta|bli&s;hed upon tho&s;e Rights, and that if it began at noon, it would end at night.</Q> Mr. Pitt is not yet arrived to the degree of a &s;chool-boy in this &s;pecies of knowledge. His practice has been con|fined to the means of <HI>extorting revenue,</HI> and his boa&s;t has been&mdash;<HI>how much?</HI> Whereas the boa&s;t of the Sy&s;tem of Government that I am &s;peaking of, is not how much, but how little.</P>
<P>The Sy&s;tem of Government purely repre&s;enta|tive, unmixed with any thing of hereditary non|&s;en&s;e, began in America. I will now compare the
<PB N="9" REF="8">effects of that &s;y&s;tem of Government with the &s;y&s;|tem of Government in England, both during, and &s;ince the clo&s;e of the war.</P>
<P>So powerful is the Repre&s;entative Sy&s;tem; fir&s;t, by combining and con&s;olidating all the parts of a country together, however great the extent; and &s;econdly, by admitting of none but men properly qualified into the Government, or di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them if they prove to be otherwi&s;e, that America was enabled thereby totally to defeat and overthrow all the &s;chemes and projects of the Hereditary Govern|ment of England again&s;t her. As the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Revolution and Independence of America is a proof of this fact, it is needle&s;s to enlarge upon it.</P>
<P>I now come to the comparative effect of the two Sy&s;tems <HI>&s;ince</HI> the clo&s;e of the war, and I reque&s;t Mr. Adam to attend to it.</P>
<P>America had internally &s;u&s;tained the ravage of upwards of &s;even years of war, which England had not. England &s;u&s;tained only the expence of the war; whereas America &s;u&s;tained, not only the expence, but the de&s;truction of property committed by <HI>both</HI> armies. Not a hou&s;e was built during that period, and many thou&s;ands were de&s;troyed. The farms and plantations along the coa&s;t of the Coun|try, for more than a thou&s;and miles, were laid wa&s;te. Her commerce was annihilated. Her &s;hips were either taken or had rotted within her own
<PB N="10" REF="9">harbour. The credit of her funds had fallen up|wards of ninety per cent. that is, an original hundred pounds would not &s;ell for ten pounds. In fine, &s;he was apparently put back an hundred years when the war clo&s;ed; which was not the ca&s;e with England.</P>
<P>But &s;uch was the event, that the &s;ame Repre|&s;entative Sy&s;tem of Government, though &s;ince better organized, which enabled her to conquer, enabled her al&s;o to recover; and &s;he now pre&s;ents a more flouri&s;hing condition, and a more happy and harmonized &s;ociety under that &s;y&s;tem of Go|vernment, than any country in the world can boa&s;t under any other. Her towns are rebuilt, much better than before; her farms and plantations are in higher improvement than ever; her com|merce is &s;pread over the world, and her funds have ri&s;en from le&s;s than ten pounds the hundred to up|wards of one hundred and twenty. Mr. Pitt, and his colleagues, talk of the things that have happen|ed in his boyi&s;h Admini&s;tration, without knowing what greater things have happened el&s;ewhere, and under other &s;y&s;tems of Government.</P>
<P>I next come to &s;tate the expence of the two &s;y&s;tems, as they now &s;tand in each of the countries; but it may fir&s;t be proper to ob&s;erve, that Go|vernment in America is what it ought to be, a mat|ter of honour and tru&s;t, and not made a trade of for the purpo&s;e of lucre.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">The whole amount of the nett taxes in England (exclu&s;ive of the expence of collection, of draw|backs, of &s;eizures and condemnations, of fines and penalties, of fees of office, of litigations and in|formers, which are &s;ome of the ble&s;&s;ed means of enforcing them) is, &s;eventeen millions. Of this &s;um, about nine millions go for the payment of the intere&s;t of the National Debt, and the re|mainder, being about eight millions, is for the cur|rent annual expences. Thus much for one &s;ide of the ca&s;e. I now come to the other.</P>
<P>The expence of all the &s;everal departments of the general Repre&s;entative Government of the United States of America, extending over a &s;pace of country nearly ten times larger than England, is two hundred and ninety-four thou&s;and, five hundred and fifty-eight dollars, which, at 4s. 6d. per dollar, is 66,275l. 11s. &s;terling, and is thus apportioned.</P>

<P>On account of the incur&s;ions of the Indians on the back &s;ettlements, Congre&s;s is, at this time, ob|liged to keep &s;ix thou&s;and militia in pay, in addi|tion to a regiment of foot, and a battalion of ar|tillery, which it always keeps; and this increa&s;es the expence of the War Department to 390,000 dollars, which is 87,795l. &s;terling, but when Peace &s;hall be concluded with the Indians, the greate&s;t part of this expence will cea&s;e, and the total amount of the expence of Government, including that of the army, will not amount to one hundred
<PB N="13" REF="12">thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, which, as has been al|ready &s;tated, is but an eightieth part of the expences of the Engli&s;h Government.</P>
<P>I reque&s;t Mr. Adam and Mr. Dundas, and all tho&s;e who are talking of Con&s;titutions, and ble&s;|&s;ings, and Kings, and Lords, and the Lord knows what, to look at this &s;tatement. Here is a form and &s;y&s;tem of Government, that is better orga|nized and better admini&s;tered than any Govern|ment in the world, and that for le&s;s than one hun|dred thou&s;and pounds per annum, and yet every Member of Congre&s;s receives, as a compen&s;ation for his time and attendance on public bu&s;ine&s;s, one pound &s;even &s;hillings per day, which is at the rate of nearly five hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>This is a Government that has nothing to fear. It needs no proclamations to deter people from writing and reading. It needs no political &s;uper|&s;tition to &s;upport it. It was by encouraging di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, and rendering the pre&s;s free upon all &s;ubjects of Government, that the principles of Government became under&s;tood in America, and the people are now enjoying the pre&s;ent ble&s;&s;ings under it. You hear of no riots, tumults, and di&s;orders in that country; becau&s;e there exi&s;ts no cau&s;e to pro|duce them. Tho&s;e things are never the effect of Freedom, but of re&s;traint, oppre&s;&s;ion, and exce&s;|&s;ive taxation.</P>
<P>In America there is not that cla&s;s of poor and
<PB N="14" REF="13">wretched people that are &s;o numerou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed all over England, and who are to be told by a Proclamation, that they are happy; and this is in a great mea&s;ure to be accounted for, not by the difference of Proclamations, but by the difference of Governments and the difference of Taxes be|tween that country and this. What the labouring people of that country earn they apply to their own u&s;e, and to the education of their children, and do not pay it away in Taxes as fa&s;t as they earn it, to &s;upport Court extravagance, and a long enormous li&s;t of Place-men and Pen&s;ioners; and be&s;ides this, they have learned the manly doctrine of reverenc|ing them&s;elves, and con&s;equently of re&s;pecting each other; and they laugh at tho&s;e imaginary be|ings called Kings and Lords, and all the fraudulent trumpery of Courts.</P>
<P>When Place-men and Pen&s;ioners, or tho&s;e who expect to be &s;uch, are lavi&s;h in prai&s;e of a Govern|ment, it is not a &s;ign of its being a good one. The pen&s;ion li&s;t alone, in England, (&s;ee Sir John Sin|clair's Hi&s;tory of the Revenue, page 6 of the Ap|pendix,) is One Hundred and Seven Thou&s;and Four Hundred and Four Pounds, <HI>which is more than the expences of the whole Government of America amount to.</HI> And I am now more convinced than before, that the offer that was made to me of a Thou&s;and Pounds, for the copy-right of the Se|cond Part of the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> together with the
<PB N="15" REF="14">remaining copy-right of the Fir&s;t Part, was to have effected, by a quick &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, what is now at|tempted to be done by a Pro&s;ecution. The con|nection which the per&s;on who made that offer has with the King's Printing Office, may furni&s;h part of the means of enquiring into this affair, when the Mini&s;try &s;hould plea&s;e to bring their Pro&s;ecution to i&s;&s;ue. But to return to my &s;ubject&mdash;</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and I repeat it here, that the &s;ervice of any man, whether called King, Pre&s;ident, Senator, Legi&s;|lator, or any thing el&s;e, cannot be worth more to any country, in the regular routine of office, than Ten Thou&s;and Pounds per annum. We have a better man in America, and more of a Gentleman than any King I ever knew of, who does not occa|&s;ion even half that expence; for, though the &s;alary is fixed at Five Thou&s;and Six hundred and Twen|ty-Five Pounds, he does not accept it, and it is only the incidental expences that are paid out of it. The name by which a man is called is, of it&s;elf, but an empty thing. It is worth and character alone which can render him valuable, for without the&s;e, Kings, and Lords, and Pre&s;idents, are but jingling names.</P>
<P>But without troubling my&s;elf about Con&s;titutions of Government, I have &s;hewn, in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> that an alliance may be formed between England, France, and America, and that
<PB N="16" REF="15">the expences of Government in England may be put back to one million and an half, viz.

And even this &s;um is fifteen times greater than the expences of Government are in America; and it is al&s;o greater than the whole peace e&s;tabli&s;hment of England amounted to about an hundred years ago. So much has the weight and oppre&s;&s;ion of Taxes encrea&s;ed &s;ince the Revolution, and e&s;pecially &s;ince the year 1714.</P>
<P>To &s;hew that the &s;um of 500,000l. is &s;ufficient to defray all the civil expences of Government, I have, in that work, annexed the following e&s;timate for any country of the &s;ame extent as England:</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, three hundred Repre&s;entatives, fairly elected, are &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es to which Legi&s;lation can apply, and preferable to a larger number.</P>
<P>If then an allowance, at the rate of five hun|dred pounds per ann. be made for every Repre&s;en|tative, deducting for non-attendance the expence, if the whole number attended &s;ix months each year, would be &mdash; 75,000</P>

<P>If a Nation cho&s;e, it might deduct four per cent from all the offices, and make one of twenty thou&s;and pounds per annum, and &s;tile the per&s;on who &s;hould fill it, King, or Maje&s;ty, or Madje&s;ty, or give him any other title.</P>
<P>Taking, however, this &s;um of one million and an half, as an abundant &s;upply for all the expences of Government under any form whatever, there will remain a &s;urplus of nearly &s;ix million and a half out of the pre&s;ent Taxes, after paying the in|tere&s;t of the National Debt; and I have &s;hewn in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> what appears to me, the be&s;t mode of applying the &s;urplus money; for I am now &s;peaking of expences and &s;avings, and not of &s;y&s;tems of Government.</P>
<P>I have in the fir&s;t place, e&s;timated the poor-rates at two millions annually, and &s;hewn that the fir&s;t effectual &s;tep would be to aboli&s;h the poor-rates
<PB N="18" REF="17">entirely, (which would be a &s;aving of two millions to the hou&s;e-keepers,) and to remit four millions out of the &s;urplus taxes to the poor to be paid to them in money in proportion to the number of children in each family, and the number of aged per&s;ons.</P>
<P>I have e&s;timated the number of per&s;ons of both &s;exes in England of fifty years of age and upwards at 420,000, and have taken one-third of this num|ber, viz. 140,000, to be poor people.</P>
<P>To &s;ave long calculations, I have taken 70,000 of them to be upwards of fifty years of age and under &s;ixty, and the other to be &s;ixty years and upwards; and to allow &s;ix pounds per ann. to the former cla&s;s, and ten pounds per ann. to the latter. The expence of which will be,

</ROW>
</TABLE>
There will then remain of the four millions 2,880,000l. I have &s;tated two different methods of appropriating this money. The one is to pay it in proportion to the number of children in each family, at the rate of three or four pounds per ann. for each child; the other is, to apportion it ac|cording to the expence of living in different coun|ties; but in either of the&s;e ca&s;es it would, together with the allowance to be made to the aged, com|pletely
<PB N="19" REF="18">take off taxes from one-third of all the families in England, be&s;ides relieving all the other families from the burthen of poor-rates.</P>
<P>The whole number of families in England, lot|ting five &s;ouls to each family, is one million four hundred thou&s;and, of which I take one third, viz. 466,666 to be poor families who now pay four million of taxes, and that the poore&s;t pays at lea&s;t four guineas a year; and that the other thirteen millions are paid by the other two-thirds. The plan, therefore, as &s;tated in the work is, fir&s;t, to remit or repay, as is already &s;tated, this &s;um of four millions to the poor, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate them from the others in the pre&s;ent mode of collecting taxes on articles of con&s;ump|tion; and, &s;econdly, to aboli&s;h the poor-rates, the hou&s;e and window light tax, and to change the Commutation Tax into a progre&s;&s;ive Tax on large e&s;tates, the particulars of all which are &s;et forth in the work, and to which I de&s;ire Mr. ADAM to refer for particulars. I &s;hall here con|tent my&s;elf with &s;aying, that to a town of the population of Manche&s;ter, it will make a dif|ference in its favour, compared with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, of upwards of fifty thou&s;and pounds annually, and &s;o in proportion to all other places throughout the nation. This certainly is of more con&s;equence, than that the &s;ame &s;ums &s;hould be collected to be afterwards &s;pent by riotous and
<PB N="20" REF="19">profligate courtiers, and in nightly revels at the Star and Garter Tavern, Pall Mall.</P>
<P>I will conclude this part of my letter with an extract from the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> which Mr. Dundas (a man rolling in luxury at the expence of the nation) has branded with the epithet of "wicked."</P>
<P><Q>By the operation of this plan, the poor laws, tho&s;e in&s;truments of civil torture, will be &s;u|per&s;eded, and the wa&s;teful expence of litigation prevented. The hearts of the humane will not be &s;hocked by ragged and hungry children, and per&s;ons of &s;eventy and eighty years of age begging for bread. The dying poor will not be dragged from place to place, to breathe their la&s;t, as a repri&s;al of pari&s;h upon pari&s;h. Wi|dows will have a maintenance for their chil|dren, and not be carted away, on the death of their hu&s;bands, like culprits and criminals, and children will no longer be con&s;idered as increa&s;|ing the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their parents. The haunts of the wretched will be known, becau&s;e it will be to their advantage, and the number of petty crimes, the offspring of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, will be le&s;&s;ened. The poor, as well as the rich, will then be intere&s;ted in the &s;upport of Government, and the cau&s;e and apprehen&s;ion of riots and tumults will cea&s;e.&mdash;Ye who &s;it in ea&s;e, and &s;olace your&s;elves in plenty, and &s;uch
<PB N="21" REF="20">there are in Turkey and Ru&s;&s;ia as well as in England, and who &s;ay to your&s;elves, <HI>are we not well off?</HI> have ye thought of the&s;e things? When ye do, ye will cea&s;e to &s;peak and feel for your&s;elves alone.</Q>&mdash;Rights of Man, Part II. page 136.</P>
<P>After this remi&s;&s;ion of four millions be made, and the poor Rates and Hou&s;e and Window-light Tax be aboli&s;hed, and the Commutation Tax changed, there will &s;till remain nearly one million and an half of &s;urplus Taxes; and as by an alli|ance between England, France, and America, armies and navies will, in a great mea&s;ure, be rendered unnece&s;&s;ary; and as men who have either been brought up in, or long habited to, tho&s;e lines of life, are &s;till citizens of a nation in com|mon with the re&s;t, and have a right to participate in all plans of National benefit, it is &s;tated in that work (Rights of Man, part II.) to apply annually 507,000l. out of the &s;urplus taxes to this purpo&s;e in the following manner:

<P><PB N="22" REF="21">The limits to which it is proper to confine this Letter, will not admit of my entering into further particulars. I addre&s;s it to Mr. Dundas becau&s;e he took the lead in the debate, and he wi&s;hes, I &s;uppo&s;e, to appear con&s;picuous; but the purport of it is to ju&s;tify my&s;elf from the charge which Mr. Adam has made.</P>
<P>This Gentleman, as has been ob&s;erved in the beginning of this Letter, con&s;iders the writings of Harrington, Moore, and Hume, as ju&s;tifiable and legal Publications, becau&s;e they rea&s;oned by compari&s;on, though, in &s;o doing, they &s;hewed plans and &s;y&s;tems of Government, not only different from, but preferable to, that of England; and he accu&s;es me of endeavouring to confu&s;e, in&s;tead of producing a &s;y&s;tem in the room of that which I have rea&s;oned again&s;t; whereas the fact is, that I have not only rea&s;oned by compari&s;on of the Repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem again&s;t the Hereditary &s;y&s;tem, but I have gone further; for I have pro|duced an in&s;tance of a Government e&s;tabli&s;hed en|tirely on the Repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem, under which much greater happine&s;s is enjoyed, much fewer Tax|es required, and much higher credit is e&s;tabli&s;hed, than under the &s;y&s;tem of Government in England. The funds in England have ri&s;en &s;ince the war only from 54l. to 97l. and they have been down, &s;ince the Proclamation, to 87l. whereas the Funds in America ro&s;e in the mean time from 10l. to 120l.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">His charge again&s;t me "of de&s;troying every principle of &s;ubordination," is equally as ground|le&s;s, which even a &s;ingle paragraph from the work will prove, and which I &s;hall here quote:</P>
<P><Q>Formerly, when divi&s;ions aro&s;e re&s;pecting Governments, recour&s;e was had to the &s;word, and a civil war en&s;ued. That &s;avage cu&s;tom is exploded by the new &s;y&s;tem, and <HI>recour&s;e is had to a National Convention.</HI> Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and the general will, arbitrates the que&s;tion, and to this private opinion yields with a good grace, and <HI>order is pre&s;erved uninterrupted.</HI>&mdash;</Q> Rights of Man, Part II. p. 173.</P>
<P>That two different charges &s;hould be brought at the &s;ame time, the one by a Member of the Legi&s;lature for <HI>not</HI> doing a certain thing, and the other by the Attorney General for <HI>doing</HI> it, is a &s;trange jumble of contradictions. I have now ju&s;tified my&s;elf, or the work rather, again&s;t the fir&s;t, by &s;tating the ca&s;e in this letter, and the ju&s;tification of the other will be undertaken in its proper place. But in any ca&s;e the work will go on.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude this Letter, with &s;aying, that the only objection I found again&s;t the plan, and principles contained in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man</HI> when I had written the book, was, that they would beneficially intere&s;t at lea&s;t ninety-nine per&s;ons out of every hundred throughout the nation, and therefore would not leave &s;ufficient
<PB N="24" REF="23">room for men to act from the direct and di&s;in|tere&s;ted principle of honour; but the pro&s;ecution now commenced has fortunately removed that ob|jection, and the approvers and protectors of that work now feel the immediate impul&s;e of honour, added to that of National Intere&s;t.</P>
