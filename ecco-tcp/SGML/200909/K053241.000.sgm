<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALL Authors of Grammar lay claim to clearne&s;s and conci&s;ene&s;s, whereas no|thing is more evident than that they have mi&s;&s;ed of the end propo&s;ed; the various Engli&s;h grammars hitherto publi&s;hed being &s;o complex, and the whole matter made &s;uch a &s;tudy, that the <HI>de&s;ideratum</HI> &s;ought for is not to be acquired without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a ma&s;ter, and the application of years. The de&s;ign of this Ab&s;tract is to teach a per&s;on acquainted with Engli&s;h how to &s;peak and write correctly, without entering into all the <HI>minutiae</HI> of Grammar, which &s;erve only to perplex and confound. The Author aims not at teaching his pupil what words are
<PB N="iv" REF="5">particles, what prepo&s;itions, and &s;o on; but merely to avoid fal&s;e concords and incorrect language; and he flatters him&s;elf the few following pages will an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es better than more complete or regular &s;y&s;tems. He has al&s;o added &s;ome few rules for read|ing, which, if attended to, mu&s;t lead to reading well.</P>

<HEAD>ABSTRACT OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the denomination of Words.</HEAD>
<P>THE only words nece&s;&s;ary to be known gram|matically, are <HI>Nouns, Pronouns, Adjectives, Verbs, Adverbs,</HI> and <HI>Participles.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Noun</HI> is the name of a thing, as <HI>Hor&s;e, Boat, Knife,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>A <HI>Pronoun</HI> is a &s;ub&s;titute for a Noun, as <HI>I, he, &s;he,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>An <HI>Adjective</HI> expre&s;&s;es the quality of a Noun, as a <HI>&s;ound Hor&s;e;</HI> an <HI>open Boat;</HI> a <HI>&s;harp Knife;</HI> here <HI>&s;ound, open,</HI> and <HI>&s;harp,</HI> are Verbs.</P>
<P>A <HI>Verb</HI> implies the action of the Noun, and an <HI>Adverb</HI> the action of the Verb, as the hor&s;e <HI>gallops,</HI> the boat <HI>&s;ails,</HI> the knife <HI>cuts:</HI> Here <HI>galloping</HI> is the action of the hor&s;e; <HI>&s;ailing</HI> the action of the boat; and <HI>cutting</HI> the action of the knife; of cour&s;e, <HI>gallops, &s;ails,</HI> and <HI>cuts</HI> are Verbs.</P>
<P>An Adverb expre&s;&s;es the action of the Verb. Thus the hor&s;e gallops <HI>quick;</HI> the boat &s;ails <HI>bri&s;kly;</HI> the knife cuts <HI>badly.</HI> Here <HI>quick</HI> expre&s;&s;es the action of <HI>galloping; bri&s;kly</HI> that of &s;ailing, and <HI>badly</HI> that of <HI>cutting;</HI> of cour&s;e <HI>quick, bri&s;kly,</HI> and <HI>badly</HI> are Adverbs, that is, addition to Verbs.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">A Participle partakes of the qualities of both Noun and Verb, and implies, acting or being acted on.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the different parts of &s;peech, I would wi&s;h my pupil to be acquainted with. I will treat of them in their order.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> NOUNS.</HEAD>
<P>Nouns Sub&s;tantives are the <HI>general</HI> names o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> things, except proper names, which are <HI>particular</HI> ones. A hor&s;e, for example, is a <HI>general</HI> name, it may be <HI>my</HI> hor&s;e or <HI>yours,</HI> &s;o is a boat, a knife, &amp;c. but proper names are <HI>particular</HI> ones, as <HI>Thomas,</HI> the name of a man: <HI>Jolly,</HI> the name of a hor&s;e, &amp;c. <HI>Hor&s;e, boat, knife,</HI> &amp;c. then are Nouns.</P>
<P>Nouns have two numbers, the <HI>&s;ingular</HI> and the <HI>plural.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ingular number expre&s;&s;es <HI>an individual,</HI> as a <HI>hor&s;e,</HI> a <HI>boat,</HI> a <HI>knife;</HI> the plural expre&s;&s;es many, as <HI>hor&s;es, boats, knives,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In other languages Nouns have a variety of <HI>ca&s;es,</HI> that is, vary in their terminations, but in Engli&s;h there are but two: the&s;e corre&s;pond with the <HI>geni|tive</HI> and <HI>accu&s;ative.</HI> Thus, in&s;tead of the head <HI>of a hor&s;e,</HI> we &s;ay, <HI>a hor&s;e's head,</HI> (not <HI>hor&s;es,</HI> which is the plural number of hor&s;e, but <HI>hor&s;e's,</HI> which we call the genitive ca&s;e &s;ingular); &s;o <HI>boat's, knife's,</HI> as the <HI>boat's</HI> &s;ide, the <HI>knife's</HI> edge.</P>
<P>Plurals ending in <HI>s</HI> have no genitive ca&s;es, we write <HI>womens,</HI> not <HI>women's; mens,</HI> not <HI>men's;</HI> and &s;o on.</P>
<P>No Nouns have accu&s;ative ca&s;es, but Pronouns; the&s;e vary their terminations when they follow or are acted upon by verbs.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="8"><HI>I</HI> preceding a verb, is changed to <HI>me</HI> when fol|lowing one.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><LABEL>We</LABEL> to <HI>us.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>Thou</LABEL> to <HI>thee</HI> or <HI>you.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>Ye</LABEL> to <HI>you.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>He</LABEL> to <HI>him.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>She</LABEL> to <HI>her.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>They</LABEL> to <HI>them.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>Who</LABEL> to <HI>whom.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Thus we &s;ay, "<HI>I</HI> love you." <HI>I</HI> here <HI>precedes</HI> the verb <HI>love;</HI> but <HI>I</HI> could not <HI>follow</HI> the &s;ame verb with propriety, it would be rendered <HI>me.</HI> We &s;hould not &s;ay "You love <HI>I,</HI>" but "you love <HI>me.</HI>" So again, "<HI>Thou</HI> love&s;t me;" "I love <HI>thee." Thou</HI> before the verb, <HI>thee</HI> after it. "<HI>We</HI> love God;" "God loves <HI>us;</HI>" and &s;o on.</P>
<P>The words <HI>who</HI> and <HI>whom</HI> require a little further explanation. We &s;ay, "Kings are per&s;onages <HI>whom</HI> we revere." Here, though, in the pre&s;ent mode of &s;peech, <HI>whom</HI> precedes the verb <HI>revere,</HI> it is neverthele&s;s u&s;ed in the accu&s;ative ca&s;e, being the word which the verb <HI>revere</HI> governs and acts upon, an&s;wering to <HI>them,</HI> when we &s;ay "we revere them." So in the following example: "William was the per&s;on <HI>who</HI> came to me." Here the pro|noun <HI>who</HI> precedes the verb <HI>came,</HI> and governs it. "William was the per&s;on to <HI>whom</HI> I &s;poke." Here <HI>whom,</HI> though it precedes, or is placed, before the verb <HI>&s;poke,</HI> (to render it more agreeable to the ear) is governed or acted on by it.</P>
<P>Engli&s;h Nouns are then thus declined, none hav|ing accu&s;ative ca&s;es but the Pronouns.</P>

<P>But <HI>of which</HI> is now mo&s;t common. "The mat+ters <HI>of which</HI> I &s;poke." Though <HI>who&s;e</HI> may be u&s;ed with propriety, when it refers to per&s;ons; as "This is the young woman <HI>who&s;e</HI> worth I know."</P>
<P>The genitive of the other Pronouns are as fol|low:</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P><HI>Mine, thine, ours, yours</HI> or <HI>theirs,</HI> may be u&s;ed without a noun annexed, but <HI>my, thy, our, your, their,</HI> never. Thus, "Who&s;e book is this?" The an&s;wer may be <HI>mine,</HI> or <HI>thine,</HI> or <HI>ours,</HI> or <HI>yours,</HI> or <HI>theirs,</HI> alone; but if we u&s;e <HI>my, thy, our, your,</HI> or <HI>their,</HI> we mu&s;t add the noun book to it, a &s;ay, <HI>my book, thy book, our book, your book,</HI> or <HI>their book.</HI></P>
<P>When the word <HI>own</HI> is added to the pronouns <HI>my, thy, his, hers, our, your,</HI> or <HI>their,</HI> it is to render the expre&s;&s;ion more emphatical; as, "I live in my <HI>own</HI> hou&s;e;" "I did it with my <HI>own</HI> hand." &amp;c.</P>
<P>The plural number is formed, by adding <HI>s</HI> at the end of the &s;ingular number, as in the following:</P>

<P>The &s;ingular and plural of &s;ome few words are the &s;ame, as <HI>&s;heep, deer, fern, ho&s;e,</HI> in which ca&s;e the &s;ingular number is pointed out by <HI>a</HI> going be|fore them, as <HI>a &s;heep, a deer.</HI></P>
<P>Some words al&s;o have no &s;ingular number, as <HI>annals, arms, a&s;hes, bellows, breeches, cre&s;&s;es, en|trails, ides, lungs, means, nones, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, &s;heers, &s;nuf|fers, thanks, tongs, wages, dregs, news,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="11">Proper names of men, cities, rivers, countries, &amp;c. have no plurals. This rule, however, is not without &s;ome exceptions. We &s;ay, "There were ten <HI>Williams</HI> in company." And when &s;peaking of families, we &s;ay, the <HI>Marlboroughs,</HI> the <HI>Cavendi&s;hes,</HI> the <HI>Howards,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I can, at no better time, mention the proper u&s;e of the pronouns <HI>who, which,</HI> and <HI>what,</HI> as interro|gatives or not.</P>
<P><HI>Who</HI> is u&s;ed only when &s;peaking of per&s;ons, as, "<HI>Who</HI> is that man, or that woman?" <HI>Which,</HI> when we &s;peak of things, as, "<HI>Which</HI> is your cane? <HI>What,</HI> when we are &s;peaking of the kind, quality, or order of per&s;ons or things, as, "<HI>What</HI> lady is that?" "<HI>What</HI> hou&s;e is this?" "<HI>What</HI> (or which) place do you chu&s;e?"</P>
<P>When <HI>who</HI> and <HI>which</HI> are not interrogatives, that is, do not a&s;k a que&s;tion, they are u&s;ed with the &s;ame di&s;tinction, that is, <HI>who</HI> for per&s;ons, and <HI>which</HI> for things. We &s;ay, "William was the per&s;on <HI>who</HI> came to me." "This is the hor&s;e <HI>which</HI> I bought."</P>
<P>Now we are upon the &s;ubject of nouns, it is pro|per to &s;ay &s;omething of gender.</P>
<P>There are three genders the <HI>male, female,</HI> and <HI>neuter.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>male</HI> and <HI>female</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h the two &s;exes; whereas the <HI>neuter</HI> is applied to things without life, as not properly belonging to either of the other, as table, &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne, rock, &amp;c.</P>
<P>When we &s;peak of the <HI>male</HI> gender, we u&s;e the pronoun <HI>he;</HI> when of the <HI>female</HI> gender, <HI>&s;he;</HI> when of the <HI>neuter, it.</HI> Thus,
<Q><L>The bridegroom, <HI>he</HI> came from the barn;</L>
<L>The bride, <HI>&s;he</HI> came in from the field;</L>
<L>The table, <HI>it</HI> fell on the floor.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12">We indeed deem mo&s;t things that contain any thing within them to be of the female gender, as the <HI>earth,</HI> a <HI>&s;hip,</HI> a <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. and in poetry, where writers will frequently give &s;light to their fancy, and per&s;onify inanimate &s;ub&s;tances, they are deemed o the male or female gender, according to the idea of the Poet. Thus <HI>Death, Time,</HI> the <HI>Sun,</HI> &amp;c. are generally of the male gender; <HI>Faith, Hope, Cha|rity,</HI> &amp;c. of the female, as being of the &s;ofter virtues.</P>
<P>But our language, in many in&s;tances, &s;ave us the nece&s;&s;ity of adding pronouns to expre&s;s genders, for we often di&s;tingui&s;h the different &s;exes by di|&s;tinct words; as for example,</P>

<P>The&s;e rules premi&s;ed, the great art in writing and &s;peaking correctly, is to avoid fal&s;e concords; that is, the &s;ingular number mu&s;t never be coupled with the plural, &amp;c. Al&s;o,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The noun or pronoun, and the verb following it, mu&s;t be of the &s;ame number and per&s;on. We mu&s;t not &s;ay, <HI>I were, I</HI> being the fir&s;t per&s;on, <HI>were</HI> the &s;econd, but <HI>I am,</HI> both in the fir&s;t per&s;on; nei|ther &s;hould we &s;ay, <HI>thou were, thou</HI> being &s;ingular, and <HI>were</HI> plural, but <HI>thou wert,</HI> both &s;ingular.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="17" REF="22">2. We mu&s;t take care to u&s;e the proper word to expre&s;s the right time, whether it be pre&s;ent or pa&s;t. In the irregular verbs, the foregoing li&s;t will point out the word, in the regular ones, the termination <HI>ed</HI> will always expre&s;s the pa&s;t time. Thus, for example, we mu&s;t not &s;ay, "he <HI>breaked</HI> the bowl," but <HI>broke</HI> it; not "he <HI>come</HI> home," but <HI>came.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In the u&s;e of the words <HI>this</HI> and <HI>that,</HI> which in the plural number are <HI>the&s;e</HI> and <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> we mu&s;t take care that they agree with the number of he word they refer to. We mu&s;t not &s;ay <HI>this men</HI> or <HI>that men,</HI> the one being &s;ingular, the other plural, but <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that man, the&s;e</HI> or <HI>tho&s;e men.</HI> But where a noun has no &s;ingular number, we may add <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that</HI> to the plural of &s;uch words: thus we may &s;ay with propriety, "by <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that means.</HI>" So nouns wanting a &s;ingular number are &s;ometimes joined to a verb &s;ingular, but inelegantly, as, "the news <HI>is</HI> &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e;" "your wages <HI>is</HI> &s;mall."</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Two or more names or things in the &s;ingular number, require the verb to be in the plural. Thus "William and John <HI>are</HI> (not <HI>is</HI>) good lads," "The &s;un and wind <HI>overcame</HI> (not <HI>overcome</HI>) me."</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Names of a multitude may have either a &s;in|gular or a plural verb. Thus we may &s;ay, "The Parliament <HI>is</HI> or <HI>are</HI> &s;itting."</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. When two or more nouns, of different num|bers, follow each other with the word <HI>or</HI> or <HI>nor</HI> be|tween them, and are equally related to a common verb; the verb &s;hould agree with the noun next it. For example, "Either the hu&s;band, the wife, <HI>or</HI> their children, <HI>are</HI> in the hou&s;e", "Neither the hu&s;band, the children, <HI>nor</HI> the wife, <HI>is</HI> in the hou&s;e.".</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="18" REF="23">7. Two negatives make an affirmative. "I wasn't good for nothing," implies, "It was good &s;o &s;omething." "I can't eat no more," means, "can eat more."</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. The participle pre&s;ent is frequently &s;ub&s;tituted for the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">initive mood of a verb, and with ele|gance. Thus, in&s;tead of "I like to work," we may &s;ay "I like working." "For he delights to walk, we may &s;ay, "He delights in walking."</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. After the auxiliary verb <HI>have,</HI> it would be improper to put the pa&s;t time; the participle &s;hould always follow. Thus, it would be ingrammatica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to &s;ay, "I have <HI>&s;aw,</HI> or "I have <HI>wrote;</HI>" it &s;hould be, "I have <HI>&s;een,</HI>" or "I have <HI>written.</HI>"</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. When the leading adverbs are <HI>whether</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>either, or</HI> mu&s;t follow in the &s;ame &s;entence; where the leading adverb is <HI>neither, nor</HI> mu&s;t follow Thus, "Whether you <HI>or</HI> I &s;hall go, is not yet de|termined." "Either your <HI>or</HI> I mu&s;t ride." "Nei|ther you <HI>nor</HI> I mu&s;t &s;peak."</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. All repetitions of the &s;ame word, nay of words which expre&s;s the &s;ame thing, are carefully to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">voided, except when the &s;en&s;e would be otherwi&s;e ob&s;cure, or when it is to excite the atten|tion. For example, a repetition of the word <HI>from</HI> in the following &s;entence is allowable: the pa&s;&s;age would not be clear without it. "It proceeds not <HI>from</HI> &s;tupidity, or a &s;lothful neglect, but <HI>from</HI> a generous liberality of &s;oul. When it is to excite attention, a repetition is beautiful. "Every acti|on, nay <HI>every</HI> attention, <HI>every</HI> de&s;ign of man, is known to the Almighty."</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. With re&s;pect to Adjectives, none &s;hould be u&s;ed but &s;uch as are <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to explain the &s;ubject more fully. To &s;ay <HI>burning</HI> or <HI>&s;hining</HI> fire, is in|elegant,
<PB N="19" REF="24">becau&s;e the fir&s;t idea of fire is, that it burns and &s;hines; but if nece&s;&s;ary, we may employ adjectives to expre&s;s its other qualities, as <HI>con&s;um|ing, &s;parkling, bri&s;k,</HI> &amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In &s;hort, the words of a &s;entence ought generally to be as different from one another, both in &s;en&s;e and &s;ound, as the nature of the &s;ubject and the har|mony of the period will admit. On this the beauty of a &s;entence depends, the &s;ound being, as it were, an echo to the &s;en&s;e, and, independent of this, on the &s;moothne&s;s of the words, the choice of adjec|tives, and the ea&s;y flow of its diction. And in general, the &s;horter the period, the more nervous and emphatical it is.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>An <HI>OBSERVATION</HI> or two on <HI>WRITING</HI> and <HI>READING.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In writing, never u&s;e capital letters to begin a word, unle&s;s it be a proper name, or at the begin|ning of a &s;entence. <HI>Note,</HI> A full &s;top, or note of admiration (!) or interrogation (?), always ends a &s;entence.</P>
<P>If you quote an Author in his own words, always begin the quotation with a capital letter.</P>
<P>The word <HI>I</HI> or <HI>Oh</HI> &s;hould be always written with a capital. Every word you wi&s;h to mark as em|phatic, &s;hould begin with a capital, and have a line drawn under it; thus, Mark.</P>
<P><HI>In order to read well,</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Every one &s;hould read in an ea&s;y familiar tone, as if he were &s;peaking, (expect it be a prayer,
<PB N="20" REF="25">in which ca&s;e, a degree of &s;olemnity is required) and &s;hould adapt his voice to the &s;ubject-matter he is reading.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. When reading, ca&s;t your eye forwards to the words following, that you may have &s;een them before you are to pronounce them. This will prevent &s;tammering, or a di&s;agreeable pau&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Attend to the &s;tops, and pau&s;e at a comma, (,) whil&s;t you can count <HI>one;</HI> at a &s;emicolon, (;) <HI>two;</HI> at a colon, (:) <HI>three;</HI> and at a full &s;top, (.) <HI>four,</HI> Notes of interrogation (?) and admiration, (!) are full &s;tops. A line (thus, &mdash;) intimates a longer pau&s;e than that of full &s;top, and at every fre&s;h paragraph we are to pau&s;e longer &s;till.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Never fetch or draw the breath, where there is no &s;top; nor pa&s;s a &s;top without a pau&s;e. Pau&s;e proportionably at every &s;top, utter each word di|&s;tinctly, &s;ound the la&s;t letter of every word, read &s;low, and you will read very intelligibly.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. In reading a &s;entence, the voice &s;hould be gently rai&s;ed, until you get to the middle, (and the middle of a &s;entence is generally marked with a colon) and then &s;hould gradually fall to the end of it: but take care, that at the end of a &s;entence, you drop not the voice too low, &s;o as not to be well heard to the la&s;t word.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. In que&s;tions and pa&s;&s;ages of admiration, the voice &s;hould not fall, as at a full &s;top, but be kept up higher and higher to the end.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. To give &s;pirit and energy to a &s;entence, the leading or principal word, &s;hould be pronounced emphatically. To find out which is the emphatical word, con&s;ider the chief de&s;ign of the writer, and that word which &s;hews &s;uch de&s;ign mo&s;t, is the word to be uttered emphatically.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="26">When a noun is the emphatical word, and at|tended with an adjective, the &s;troke of the voice &s;hould be on the noun, and the adjective be only &s;welled; unle&s;s it appears that the &s;tre&s;s is to be laid on the adjective. The emphatic words in the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age are printed in Italics.</P>
<Q><L>Hail, <HI>Source</HI> of Beings! univer&s;al <HI>Soul</HI></L>
<L>Of Heav'n and Earth, e&s;&s;ential <HI>Pre&s;ence,</HI> hail!</L></Q>
<P>But where two words are &s;et in oppo&s;ition to each other, and one is pronounced emphatically, the other &s;hould be &s;o too; as in the &s;entence. "If <HI>they</HI> attack, <HI>we</HI> will attack; for <HI>our</HI> cau&s;e is as good as <HI>theirs.</HI>"</P>
<P>The empha&s;is is of &s;uch importance in reading and &s;peaking, that wrong placing it may alter the &s;en&s;e materially. The following line is an old ex|ample upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Will you ride to town to-day?</P>
<P>By laying the empha&s;is on <HI>will,</HI> the an&s;wer may be <HI>yes</HI> or <HI>no.</HI></P>
<P>By laying it on <HI>you,</HI> the an&s;wer may be, "<HI>No,</HI> but my <HI>&s;on</HI> will."</P>
<P>By laying it on <HI>ride,</HI> the an&s;wer may be, "I in|tend to <HI>walk.</HI>"</P>
<P>By placing it on the word <HI>town,</HI> the an&s;wer may be, "No, I &s;hall ride to my <HI>farm.</HI>"</P>
<P>And laying it on <HI>to-day,</HI> the an&s;wer may be, "Not until <HI>to-morrow.</HI>"</P>
<P>La&s;t of all, lay no empha&s;is on words where there &s;hould none be laid; for this is as great a mark of ignorance, as not laying it where it &s;hould be laid.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27"><HI>Rules for reading Engli&s;h ver&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The general rule is to pronounce it, as if it wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pro&s;e, but with more deliberation; to ob&s;erve th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tops with great exactne&s;s, placing the accent whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> it ought to be placed, (as will be &s;hewn hereafter and the empha&s;is upon the proper words on each line. Though there &s;hould be no &s;top at the end of the line, the reader &s;hould pau&s;e whil&s;t he can count one, merely to give notice to the hearer that the line is ended; and if the la&s;t word will bear two &s;ounds, (as words ending in <HI>y</HI> will) give it tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which chymes be&s;t with its &s;i&s;ter line.

<Q><L>My &s;oul a&s;cends above the &s;ky,</L>
<L>And triumphs in her liberty.</L></Q>
<P>However, whether pronounced as <HI>tee</HI> or <HI>ti,</HI> the la&s;t &s;yllable &s;hould be &s;o feebly uttered, as not to fix any &s;top or accent upon it.</P>
<P>If ver&s;e be read with the above attention, and &s;till &s;ound har&s;h upon the ear; the fault is not in the reader, but the poet, for tho&s;e ver&s;es are not well penned, that cannot be read gracefully by the common rules of pronunciation.</P>
