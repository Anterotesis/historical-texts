<P>HITHER TO we have pur&s;ued the Athe|nians, both in their
&s;ucce&s;&s;es and their defeats, with peculiar attention: while they took the
lead in the affairs of Greece, it was nece&s;&s;ary to place them on the fore
ground of the picture; but now we mu&s;t change the &s;cene; and, leaving the
Athenians acting an ob&s;cure part, go to tho&s;e &s;tates who
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively took the lead after their downfal.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"> Sparta &s;eems to be the fir&s;t &s;tate now that
gave laws to the re&s;t of the Greeks; their old jealou&s;ies began to revive
again&s;t the petty &s;tates that had formerly &s;ided again&s;t them: and the
Eleans were the fir&s;t upon whom they fell, under a pretence that they were
not ad|mitted by that &s;tate to the Olympic games as well as the re&s;t of the
Grecians. Having for|merly declared war, and being upon the point of plundering
the city of Elis, they were taken into the alliance of Sparta, and the
conquerors now a&s;&s;umed and enjoyed the title of the Protectors and
Arbitrators of Greece. Soon after, Age|&s;ilaus, who was cho&s;en king of
Sparta, was &s;ent into A&s;ia with an army, under pretence of freeing the
Grecian cities: he gained a &s;ignal victory over Ti&s;&s;aphernes, near the
river Pactolus, where he forced the enemy's camp, and found con&s;iderable
plunder. This &s;ucce&s;s induced the Per&s;ian monarch, in&s;tead of meet|ing
Age&s;ilaus openly in the field, to &s;ubvert his intere&s;t among the Grecian
&s;tates by the power of bribery; and indeed this confede|racy was now &s;o
weakened, its concord and unanimity &s;o totally de&s;troyed, that they were
open to every offer: the love of money was now rooted in their affections; and
the Spar|tans were the only people that, for a while, <PB N="3" REF="5">
&s;eemed to di&s;dain it: but the contagion &s;till &s;preading, even they, at
la&s;t, yielded to its al|lurements; and every man &s;ought private emo|lument,
without attending to the good of his country.</P>
<P>The Thebans, as they were the fir&s;t gained over to the Per&s;ian
intere&s;t, &s;o they were the mo&s;t active in promoting it. To &s;trengthen
their alliance, they &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the Athe|nians, with a long
repre&s;entation of the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs, wherein they artfully
in&s;inua|ted their zeal and affection to their &s;tate; from thence they took
occa&s;ion to inveigh again&s;t the tyranny of Sparta; and concluded with
telling them, that now was the time to throw off the yoke, and to recover their
former &s;plen|dor and authority. The Athenians, though they had no &s;hare of
the Per&s;ian money, needed not many arguments to engage them in a rupture of
this kind, for which they had been long waiting a fit opportunity.</P>
<P>Age&s;ilaus, who had carried on the war in Per&s;ia with
&s;ucce&s;s, received news of the war being again broke out in Greece, with
orders, at the &s;ame time, for him to return home. He had &s;et his heart upon
the entire conque&s;t of Per|&s;ia, and was preparing to march farther into the
country; but &s;uch was his deference to the laws, <PB N="4" REF="6"> and
&s;uch his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Ephori, that he in&s;tantly obeyed their
mandate; but left four thou&s;and men in A&s;ia to maintain his &s;ucce&s;&s;es
there. The Spartans, however, could not wait his arrival; they found
confederacies thicken on their hands, and they were ready to be at|tacked on
all &s;ides. The Athenians, Argives, Thebans, Corinthians, and Eubaeans joined
again&s;t them, and made up a body of twenty-four thou&s;and men; both &s;ides
encamped near Sicyon, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other; and &s;oon came
to a regular engagement. The Spartan allies at fir&s;t were entirely routed;
but the Spartans them&s;elves turned the &s;cale of victory by their &s;ingle
valour, and came off conquerors with the lo&s;s of but eight men. This victory,
however, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure overbalanced by a lo&s;s at &s;ea, which the
Spartans &s;u&s;tained near Cnidus. Conon, the Athenian General, being
appointed to com|mand the Per&s;ian fleet again&s;t them, took fifty of their
&s;hips, and pur&s;ued the re&s;t into port. Age&s;ilaus, on the other hand,
gained a con&s;iderable victory over the Athenians and their allies upon the
plains of Coronea. Thus was the war continued by furious but unde|ci&s;ive
engagements, in which neither &s;ide was a gainer; and in this manner did the
Spartans <PB N="5" REF="7"> maintain them&s;elves and their allies, without any
con&s;iderable increa&s;e or diminution of their power. In this general
&s;hock, the Athenians &s;eemed for a while to recover their former &s;pi|rit;
being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Per&s;ian money, and con|ducted by Conon, an excellent
general, they took the field with ardour, and even rebuilt the walls of their
city. From the mutual jealou|&s;ies of the&s;e petty &s;tates among each other,
all were weakened, and the Per&s;ian monarch be|came arbitrator of Greece. In
this manner, after a fluctuation of &s;ucce&s;&s;es and intrigues, all par|ties
began to grow tired of a war, and a peace en&s;ued: this peace was concluded in
the &s;econd year of the 98th Olympiad; and from the many &s;tipulations in
favour of Per&s;ia, Plutarch terms it, The reproach and ruin of Greece.</P>
<P>The Spartans, thus freed from the terrors of a powerful foreign
enemy, went on to &s;pread terror among the petty &s;tates of Greece: they gave
peremptory orders to the Mantineans to throw down their walls, and compelled
them to obedience. They obliged the Corinthians to withdraw the garri&s;on from
Argo&s;i; and &s;ome other little &s;tates they treated with an air of
&s;uperiority that plainly marked, that they expected obedience. They marched
again&s;t the Olynthians, who had lately grown <PB N="6" REF="8"> into power,
and effectually &s;ubdued them. They interpo&s;ed al&s;o in a dome&s;tic
quarrel which was carried on at Thebes. Phaebidas having &s;eized upon the
citadel, they turned him out, and placed a garri&s;on of their own in that
fortre&s;s. They then procured arti|cles to be exhibited again&s;t I&s;menias
his an|tagoni&s;t, for having taken money of the Per|&s;ians, and holding
intelligence with them; and for having been a principal promoter of their
inte&s;tine broils: upon which he underwent a formal trial before the
commi&s;&s;ioners de|puted from Sparta; and one from each of the other great
cities of Greece, and was condemn|ed to death. Thus, having &s;ecured Thebes,
and having by a tedious war humbled the Olyn|thians, they went on to
cha&s;ti&s;e the Phlia&s;ians for having abu&s;ed &s;ome exiles that had been
re&s;tored by the orders of Sparta. In this man|ner they continued
di&s;tributing their orders with pride and &s;everity; no &s;tate of Greece was
able to oppo&s;e their authority; and under the co|lour of executing ju&s;tice,
they were hourly pa|ving the way to &s;upreme command. In the mid&s;t of this
&s;ecurity, they were alarmed from a quar|ter where they lea&s;t expected. The
Thebans had, for four years &s;ince the &s;eizing of their cita|del,
&s;ubmitted to the Spartan yoke; but they <PB N="7" REF="9"> now took
occa&s;ion, by a very de&s;perate at|tempt, to throw it off; for which
purpo&s;e, there was a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence carried on between the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable of the exiles of Athens, and tho&s;e who were well affected to
them in Thebes; and mea&s;ures were conduct|ed between them by Phyllidas,
&s;ecretary to the Theban governors, by who&s;e contrivance a competent number
of the exiles were to get into the city; and Charon, a man of the fir&s;t rank
there, offered his hou&s;e for their reception. The day being fixed, they &s;et
out from Athens; and twelve of the mo&s;t active and re&s;olute among them were
detached to enter the city, the re&s;t remaining at a proper di&s;tance to wait
the event. The fir&s;t who offered him&s;elf was Pelopidas, who was young and
daring, and had been very zealous in encouraging the de|&s;ign; and, by the
&s;hare he had in it, gave a &s;ufficient earne&s;t of what might be further
ex|pected from him in the &s;ervice of his country. The next man of
con&s;equence was Mellon, who, by &s;ome, is &s;aid to have fir&s;t projected
the &s;cheme with Phyllidas. The&s;e two, with their ten a&s;&s;ociates,
dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves like pea&s;ants, and beat about the fields with dogs
and hunting-poles, as in &s;earch of game. Having thus pa&s;&s;ed
un&s;u&s;pected, and con|veyed <PB N="8" REF="10"> them&s;elves into the city,
they met at Charon's hou&s;e, as the general rendezvous, when they were &s;oon
after joined by thirty-&s;ix more of their confederates. It was concerted, that
Phyllidas &s;hould, on that day, give a great en|tertainment to Archias and
Philip, the two governors who were appointed by the Spar|tans; and, to make it
the more complete, he had engaged to provide &s;ome of the fine&s;t women in
the town to give them a meeting. Matters being thus prepared, the
a&s;&s;ociates di|vided them&s;elves into two bands; one of which, led by
Charon and Mellon, were to attack Archias and his company: and having put on
women's cloaths over their armour, with pine and poplar over their heads, to
&s;hade their faces, they took their opportunity when the gue&s;ts were well
heated with wine, to enter the room, and immediately &s;tabbed Archias and
Philip, with &s;uch others of the company as were pointed out to them by
Phyllidas. A little before this execution, Archias received an expre&s;s from
Athens, with all the particulars of the con&s;piracy; and the courier conjured
him, in the name of the per&s;on who wrote the letters, that he &s;hould read
them forthwith, for that they contained matter of great importance. But he laid
them by unopened; and, with a <PB N="9" REF="11"> &s;mile, &s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"Bu&s;ine&s;s to-morrow:"</Q> which words, upon that
occa&s;ion, grew into a proverb. The other band, headed by Pelopidas and
Damo|clides, went to attack Leontiades, who was at home, and in bed. They
ru&s;hed into his hou&s;e by &s;urprize; but he, &s;oon taking the alarm,
leaped up, and, with his &s;word in his hand, re|ceived them at his
chamber-door, and &s;tabbed Cephi&s;odorus, who was the fir&s;t man that
at|tempted to enter. Pelopidas was the next who encountered him; and, after a
long and difficult di&s;pute, killed him. From thence they went in pur&s;uit of
Hypates, his friend and neighbour, and di&s;patched him likewi&s;e; after which
they joined the other band, and &s;ent to ha&s;ten the exiles they had left in
Attica.</P>
<P>The whole city was by this time filled with terror and confu&s;ion;
the hou&s;es full of lights, and the inhabitants running to and fro in the
&s;treets, in a wild, di&s;tracted manner, and waiting impatiently for
day-light, that they might di&s;tin|gui&s;h their friends from their foes,
&s;eemed un|determined what cour&s;e to take. Early in the morning, the exiles
came in armed; and Pelopi|das appeared with his party, in a general
a&s;&s;embly of the people, encompa&s;&s;ed by the prie&s;ts, car|rying
garlands in their hands, proclaiming li|berty to the Thebans in general, and
exhorting <PB N="10" REF="12"> them to fight for their gods and their country;
for though they had made &s;uch a pro&s;perous beginning, the mo&s;t difficult
part &s;till remained, whil&s;t the citadel was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the Spartans, with a garri&s;on of fifteen hundred men, be&s;ides a great
number of citizens and others, who had fled to them for protection, and
declared them&s;elves on their &s;ide.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, the Athenians &s;ent five thou&s;and foot,
and two thou&s;and hor&s;e, to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Pelopidas: &s;everal
other bodies of troops al&s;o came in from all the cities of Boeotia; &s;o that
the citadel being hemmed round, and de&s;pairing of &s;uccours from without,
&s;urrendered at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The Thebans having thus acquired their freedom, the Spartans were
re&s;olved, at any rate, to take the lead in the affairs of Greece; and having
incen&s;ed the&s;e beyond mea&s;ure, at|tempted to &s;eize upon the Pyraeus,
and thus made the Athenians their irreconcileable ene|mies. Age&s;ilaus was
pitched upon to command the army that was to humble the Grecian &s;tates. His
name &s;truck a terror into the Thebans; and his forces, which amounted to near
twenty thou&s;and men, increa&s;ed their fears. The Thebans, therefore,
in&s;tead of attempting to attack, were contented to &s;tand upon their
de|fence, <PB N="11" REF="13"> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of a hill
near the city. Age&s;ilaus detached a party of light armed men, to provoke them
to come down and give him battle; which they declining, he drew out his whole
forces, in order to attack them. Chabrias, who commanded the merce|naries on
the part of the Thebans, ordered his men to pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and keep
their ranks in clo&s;e order, with their &s;hields laid down at their feet, and
their &s;pears advanced, and with one leg put forward, and the knee upon the
half-bent. Age&s;ilaus, finding them prepared in this manner to receive him,
and that they &s;tood as it were in defiance of him, thought fit to withdraw
his army; and contented him&s;elf with ravaging the country. This was looked
upon as an extraordinary &s;tratagem; and Chabrias va|lued him&s;elf &s;o much
upon it, that he procured his &s;tatue to be erected in that po&s;ture.</P>
<P>Thus, through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of engagements, both by &s;ea and
land, the Spartans, having pro|voked a powerful confederacy, grew every day
weaker, and their enemies more daring. The Thebans continually grew bolder;
and, in&s;tead of continuing to defend them&s;elves with diffi|culty, attacked
the enemy with courage and &s;ucce&s;s. Though the battles fought between
the&s;e &s;tates, were neither regular nor deci&s;ive, <PB N="12" REF="14"> yet
they were &s;uch as &s;erved to rai&s;e the courage of the Thebans, to gain
them confidence, and to form them for tho&s;e great undertakings which were
&s;hortly to follow. Pelopidas, who headed them at the battle of Tanagra,
&s;lew the Spartan commander with his own hand. At the battle of Tegyra, with
very unequal forces, he put a large body of the enemy to rout. He him&s;elf
commanded a battalion of the Theban army, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the
Sacred Van. They were as remarkable for their fidelity to each other, as for
their &s;trength and courage: they were linked by the bonds of common
friend&s;hip; and were &s;worn to &s;tand by each other in the mo&s;t dangerous
extremities. Thus united, they became invincible, and generally turned the
victory in their favour, for a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of years; until they were at
la&s;t cut down, as one man, by the Macedonian phalanx under Philip.</P>
<P>A peace of &s;hort continuance followed the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es of
the Thebans; but they &s;oon fell into tumults and &s;editions again. The
inha|bitants of Xacinthus and Corcyra having ex|pelled their magi&s;trates, put
them&s;elves under the protection of Athens, and repul&s;ed the Spartans, who
attempted to re&s;tore their ma|gi&s;trates by force.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15"> About the &s;ame time, the inhabitants of
Platea, applying to their old friends the Athe|nians, for their protection and
alliance, the Thebans took offence at it, and demoli&s;hed the town; and &s;oon
after, did the &s;ame by The&s;piae. The Athenians were &s;o highly incen&s;ed
at the treatment of tho&s;e two cities, which had de&s;erved &s;o well of the
common cau&s;e in the Per&s;ian war, that they would act no longer in
conjunction with them; and, upon their breaking with them, the affairs of
Greece took a new and unexpected turn.</P>
<P>It now began to appear, that the Thebans were growing into power;
and while Sparta and Athens were weakening each other by mu|tual conte&s;ts,
this &s;tate, which had enjoyed all the emoluments, without any of the expences
of the war, was every day growing more vigo|rous and independent. The Thebans,
who now began to take the lead in the affairs of Greece, were naturally a hardy
and robu&s;t people, of &s;low intellects, and &s;trong con&s;titutions. It was
a con&s;tant maxim with them, to &s;ide either with Athens or Sparta, in their
mutual conte&s;ts; and which &s;oever they inclined to, they were generally of
weight enough to turn the balance. However, they had hitherto made no further
u&s;e of that weight, than to &s;ecure them&s;elves; <PB N="14" REF="16"> but
the &s;pirit which now appeared among them; was fir&s;t implanted by Pelopidas,
their deliverer from the Spartan yoke; but &s;till further carried to its
utmo&s;t height, by Epaminondas, who now began to figure in the affairs of
Greece.</P>
<P>Epaminondas was one of tho&s;e few exalted characters, with &s;carce
any vice, and almo&s;t eve|ry virtue to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the re&s;t of
man|kind. Though in the beginning po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every quality
nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, he cho&s;e to lead a private
life, employed in the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, and &s;hewing an example of the
mo&s;t rigid ob&s;ervance of all its doctrines.</P>
<P>Truly a philo&s;opher, and poor out of ta&s;te, he de&s;pi&s;ed
riches, without affecting any repu|tation from that contempt; and if Ju&s;tin
may be believed, he coveted glory as little as he did money. It was always
again&s;t his will that commands were conferred upon him; and he behaved
him&s;elf in them in &s;uch a manner, as did more honour to dignities, than
dignities to him.</P>
<P>Though poor him&s;elf, and without any e&s;tate, his very poverty,
by drawing upon him the e&s;teem and confidence of the rich, gave him the
opportunity of doing good to others. One of his friends being in great
nece&s;&s;ity, Epami|nondas &s;ent him to a very rich citizen, with 
<PB N="15" REF="17"> orders to a&s;k him for a thou&s;and crowns in his name:
that rich man coming to his hou&s;e, to know his motives for directing his
friend to him upon &s;uch an errand, 
<Q REND="inline">"Why," replied Epaminondas, "it is becau&s;e this
hone&s;t man is in want, and you are rich."</Q> Fond of lei|&s;ure, which he
devoted to the &s;tudy of philo|&s;ophy, his darling pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;hunned
public employments, and made no intere&s;t but to exclude him&s;elf from them.
His moderation concealed him &s;o well, that he lived ob&s;cure, and almo&s;t
unknown. His merit however di&s;|covered him. He was taken from his &s;olitude
by force, to be placed at the head of armies; and he demon&s;trated, that
philo&s;ophy, though generally in contempt with tho&s;e who a&s;pire at the
glory of arms, is wonderfully u&s;eful in forming heroes; for it was a great
advance to|wards conquering the enemy, to know how to conquer one's &s;elf: in
this &s;chool anciently were taught the great maxims of true policy, the rules
of every kind of duty, the motives for a due di&s;|charge of them, what we owe
our country, the right u&s;e of authority, wherein true courage con|&s;i&s;ts;
in a word, the qualities that form the good citizen, &s;tate&s;man, and great
captain; and in all the&s;e Epaminondas excelled.</P>
<P>He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the ornaments of the mind. He had the
talent of &s;peaking in perfection; <PB N="16" REF="18"> and was well ver&s;ed
in the mo&s;t &s;ublime &s;ciences. But a mode&s;t re&s;erve threw a veil over
all tho&s;e excellent qualities, which &s;till augmented their value, and of
which he knew not what it was to be o&s;tentatious. Spintharus, in giving his
character, &s;aid, That he never had met with a man who knew more, and &s;poke
le&s;s.</P>
<P>Such was the general appointed to command the Theban army, and act
in conjunction with Pelopidas; with whom he had the mo&s;t perfect and the
mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip. This &s;tate being left out in the
general treaty of peace, and thus having the Spartans and Athe|nians
confederated again&s;t it, they appeared under the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation,
and all Greece looked upon them as lo&s;t and undone. The Spartans ordered
levies to be made in all parts of Greece, that &s;ided with them; and
Cleom|brotus, their general, marched towards the frontiers of Boeotia, &s;ecure
of victory: willing, however, to give his ho&s;tilities an air of ju&s;tice, he
&s;ent to demand of the Thebans, that they &s;hould re&s;tore the cities that
they had u&s;urped, to their liberties; that they &s;hould rebuild tho&s;e they
had demoli&s;hed before, and make re&s;ti|tution for all their former wrongs.
To this it was replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"That the Thebans were accountable to none but
Heaven for their <PB N="17" REF="19"> conduct."</Q> Nothing now remained on
both &s;ides, but to prepare for action. Epaminondas immediately rai&s;ed all
the troops he could, and began his march: his army did not amount to &s;ix
thou&s;and men; and the enemy had above four times that number. As &s;everal
bad omens were urged to prevent his &s;etting out, he re|plied only by a
ver&s;e from Homer, of which the &s;en&s;e is, There is but one good omen; to
fight for one's country. However, to rea&s;&s;ure the &s;oldiers, by nature
&s;uper&s;titious, and whom he ob&s;erved to be di&s;couraged, he in&s;tructed
&s;everal per&s;ons to come from different places, and report auguries and
omens in his favour, which revived the &s;pirit and hopes of the troops.</P>
<P>Epaminondas had wi&s;ely taken care to &s;ecure a pa&s;s by
Cleombrotus, which might have &s;hort|ened his march con&s;iderably. The
latter, after having taken a large compa&s;s, arrived at Leuctra, a &s;mall
town of Boeotia, between Plataea and The&s;piae. Both parties con&s;ulted
whether they &s;hould give battle; which Cleombrotus re&s;olved, by the advice
of all his officers; who repre&s;ented to him, that if he declined fighting
with &s;uch a &s;uperiority of troops, it would confirm the cur|rent report,
that he &s;ecretly favoured the The|bans. The latter had an e&s;&s;ential
rea&s;on for <PB N="18" REF="20"> ha&s;tening a battle before the arrival of
the troops, which the enemy daily expected: how|ever, the &s;ix generals who
formed the council of war, differed in their &s;entiments; the &s;e|venth, who
was Epaminondas, came in very good time to join the three that were for
fight|ing; and his opinion carrying the que&s;tion, the battle was re&s;olved
upon.</P>
<P>The two armies were very unequal in num|ber: that of the
Lacedemonians, as has been &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted of twenty-&s;our thou&s;and
foot, and &s;ixteen hundred hor&s;e; the Thebans had only &s;ix thou&s;and
foot, and four hundred hor&s;e; but all of them choice troops, animated by
their ex|perience in war, and determined to conquer or die. The Lacedemonian
cavalry, compo&s;ed of men picked up by chance, without valour, and ill
di&s;ciplined, was as much inferior to their enemies in courage, as &s;uperior
in number. The infantry could not be depended on, except the Lacedemonians; the
allies, as has been &s;aid, having engaged in the war with reluctance,
be|cau&s;e they did not approve the motive of it, and being be&s;ides
diffatisfied with the Lace|demonians.</P>
<P>The ability of the generals of either &s;ide, &s;upplied the place
of numerous armies, e&s;pe|cially of the Theban, who was the mo&s;t
accom|pli&s;hed <PB N="19" REF="21"> &s;oldier of his times. He was &s;upported
by Pelopidas, at the head of the &s;acred battalion, compo&s;ed of three
hundred Thebans, united in a &s;trict friend&s;hip and affection, and engaged,
under a particular oath, never to fly, but to defend each other to the
la&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon the day of battle, the two armies drew up on a plain.
Cleombrotus was upon the right, at the head of a body con&s;i&s;ting of
Lacedemo|nians, on whom he confided mo&s;t, and who&s;e files were twelve deep:
to take the advan|tage, which his &s;uperiority of hor&s;e gave him in an open
country, he po&s;ted them in front of his Lacedemonians. Archidamus, the &s;on
of Age&s;ilaus, was at the head of the allies, who formed the left wing.</P>
<P>Epaminondas, who re&s;olved to charge with his left, which he
commanded in per&s;on, &s;trengthened it with the choice of his heavy|armed
troops, whom he drew up fifty deep: the &s;acred battalion was upon his left,
and clo&s;ed the wing: the re&s;t of his infantry were po&s;ted upon his right,
in an oblique line; which, the farther it extended, was the more di&s;tant from
the enemy. By this uncommon di&s;po&s;ition, his de&s;ign was to cover his
flank on the right; to keep off his right wing, as a kind of re&s;erved body,
that he might not hazard the event of <PB N="20" REF="22"> the battle upon the
weake&s;t part of his army; and to begin the action with his left wing, where
his be&s;t troops were po&s;ted, to turn the whole weight of the battle upon
Cleombro|tus and the Spartans. He was a&s;&s;ured that, if he could penetrate
the Lacedemonian pha|lanx, the re&s;t of the army would &s;oon be put to the
rout. As for his hor&s;e, he di&s;po&s;ed them, after the enemy's example, in
the front of his left.</P>
<P>The action began with the cavalry. As the Thebans were better
mounted, and braver troops than the Lacedemonian hor&s;e, the latter were not
long before they were broke, and driven upon the infantry, which they put into
&s;ome confu&s;ion. Epaminondas, following his hor&s;e clo&s;e, marched
&s;wiftly up to Cleombrotus, and fell upon his phalanx with all the weight of
his heavy battalion. The latter, to make a diver&s;ion, detached a body of
troops, with orders to take Epaminondas in flank, and to &s;urround him.
Pelopidas, upon the &s;ight of that movement, advanced with incredible &s;peed
and boldne&s;s, at the head of the &s;acred battalion, to prevent the enemy's
de&s;ign, and flanked Cleombrotus him&s;elf; who, by that &s;udden and
unexpected attack, was put into di&s;order. The battle was very fierce and
ob&s;tinate; and, whil&s;t <PB N="21" REF="23"> Cleombrotus could act, the
victory continued in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and declared for neither party. But when
he fell dead with his wounds, the The|bans, to complete the victory, and the
Lace|demonians, to avoid the &s;hame of abandoning the body of their king,
redoubled their efforts, and a great &s;laughter en&s;ued on both &s;ides. The
Spartans fought with &s;o much fury about the body, that at length they gained
their point, and carried it off. Animated by &s;o glorious an advantage, they
prepared to return to the charge, which would perhaps have proved
&s;ucce&s;sful, had the allies &s;econded their ardour: but the left wing,
&s;eeing the Lacedemonian phalanx broken, and believing all lo&s;t,
e&s;pe|cially when they heard that the king was dead, took to flight, and drew
off the re&s;t of the army. Epaminondas followed them vigo|rou&s;ly, and killed
a great number in the pur&s;uit. The Thebans remained ma&s;ters of the field of
battle, erected a trophy, and per|mitted the enemy to bury their dead.</P>
<P>The Lacedemonians had never received &s;uch a blow. The mo&s;t
bloody defeat, till then, had &s;carce ever co&s;t them more than four or five
hundred of their citizens. Here they lo&s;t four thou&s;and men, of whom, one
thou&s;and <PB N="22" REF="24"> were Lacedemonians, and four hundred Spar|tans,
out of &s;even hundred who were in the battle. The Thebans had only three
hundred men killed, among whom were four of their citizens.</P>
<P>The city of Sparta was celebrating at that time the Gymna&s;tic
games, and was full of &s;tran|gers, whom curio&s;ity had brought thither. When
the couriers arrived from Leuctra with the ter|rible news of their defeat, the
Ephori, though perfectly &s;en&s;ible of all the con&s;equences, and that the
Spartan empire had received a mortal wound, would not permit the
repre&s;entations of the theatre to be &s;u&s;pended, nor any changes in the
celebration of the fe&s;tival. They &s;ent to every family the names of their
relations who were killed, and &s;tayed in the theatre to &s;ee that the dances
and games were continued, without interruption, to the end.</P>
<P>The next day, in the morning, the lo&s;s of each family being known,
the fathers and rela|tions of tho&s;e who had died in the battle, met in the
public place, and &s;aluted and embraced each other with great joy and
&s;erenity in their looks, whil&s;t the others kept them&s;elves clo&s;e in
their hou&s;es; or, if nece&s;&s;ity obliged them to go abroad, it was with a
&s;adne&s;s and dejection <PB N="23" REF="25"> of a&s;pect, which &s;en&s;ibly
expre&s;&s;ed their pro|found angui&s;h and affliction. That difference was
&s;till more remarkable in the women: grief, &s;ilence, tears di&s;tingui&s;hed
tho&s;e who expected the return of their &s;ons; but &s;uch as had lo&s;t their
&s;ons, were &s;een hurrying to the temple, to thank the gods, and
congratulating each other upon their glory and good fortune.</P>
<P>One great point under immediate con&s;i|deration, was concerning
tho&s;e who had fled out of the battle. They were, by the law, in that ca&s;e,
to be degraded from all honour, and rendered infamous; in&s;omuch, that it was
a di&s;grace to intermarry with them: they were to appear publicly in mean and
dirty habits, with patched and party-coloured garments, and to go half
&s;haved; and whoever met them in the &s;treets, might in&s;ult and beat them,
and they were not to make any re&s;i&s;tance. This was &s;o &s;evere a law, and
&s;uch numbers had incurred the penalties of it, many of whom were of great
families and intere&s;t, that they apprehended the execution of it might
occa&s;ion &s;ome public commotions; be&s;ides, that the&s;e citizens, &s;uch
as they were, could very ill be &s;pared at this time, when they wanted to
recruit the army. Under this difficulty, they gave Age&s;ilaus a 
<PB N="24" REF="26"> power even over the laws, to di&s;pen&s;e with them, to
abrogate them, or to enact &s;uch new ones as the pre&s;ent exigency required.
He would not aboli&s;h or make any variation in the law it&s;elf; but made a
public declaration, That it &s;hould lie dormant for that &s;ingle day, but
revive and be in full force again on the morrow; and, by that expedient, he
&s;aved the citizens from infamy.</P>
<P>So great a victory was followed by in&s;tan|taneous effects; numbers
of the Grecian &s;tates that had hitherto remained neuter, now de|clared in
favour of the conquerors, and increa&s;ed their army to the amount of &s;eventy
thou&s;and men. Epaminondas entered Laconia with an army, the twelfth part of
which were not The|bans; and finding a country hitherto untouched by an enemy,
he ran through it with fire and &s;word, de&s;troying and plundering as far as
the river Eurotas.</P>
<P>This river was, at that time, very much &s;woln by the melting of
the &s;now; and the Thebans &s;ound more difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing it than they
expected, as well from the rapidity as the extreme coldne&s;s of the water. As
Epa|minondas was pa&s;&s;ing at the head of his infantry, &s;ome of the
Spartans &s;hewed him to Age&s;ilaus, <PB N="25" REF="27"> who, after having
attentively con&s;idered and followed him with his eyes a long time, could not
help crying out, in admiration of his va|lour, 
<Q REND="inline"><HI>Oh! the wonder-working man!</HI></Q> The The|ban
general, however, contented him&s;elf with over-running the country, without
attempting any thing upon Sparta, and, entering Arcadia, rein&s;tated it in all
its former privileges and li|berties. The Lacedemonians had &s;ome time before
&s;tripped the harmle&s;s natives of all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and obliged
them to take re|fuge among &s;trangers. Their country was equal in extent to
Laconia, and as fertile as the be&s;t in Greece. Its ancient inhabitants, who
were di&s;per&s;ed in different regions of Greece, Italy and Sicily, on the
fir&s;t notice given them, returned with incredible joy, animated by the love
of their country, natural to all men; and almo&s;t as much by the hatred of the
Spartans, which the length of time had only increa&s;ed. They built
them&s;elves a city, which, from the ancient name, was called Me&s;&s;ene.</P>
<P>After performing &s;uch &s;ignal exploits, Pelo|pidas and
Epaminondas, the Theban generals, once more returned home, not to &s;hare the
triumph and acclamations of their fellow-citi|zens, but to an&s;wer the
accu&s;ations that were <PB N="26" REF="28"> laid again&s;t them; they were now
both &s;um|moned as criminals again&s;t the &s;tate, of having retained their
po&s;ts four months beyond the time limited by law. This offence was capital by
the laws of Thebes; and tho&s;e who &s;tood up for the con&s;titution, were
very earne&s;t in having it ob&s;erved with punctuality. Pelopidas was the
fir&s;t cited before the tribunal: he defended him&s;elf with le&s;s force and
greatne&s;s of mind, than was expected from a man of his character, by nature
warm and fiery. That valour, haughty and intrepid in fight, for&s;ook him
be|fore his judges. His air and di&s;cour&s;e, which had &s;omething timid and
creeping in it, de|noted a man who was afraid of death, and did not in the
lea&s;t incline the judges in his favour, who acquitted him, not without
difficulty. Epa|minondas, on the contrary, appeared with all the confidence of
con&s;cious innocence: in&s;tead of ju&s;tifying him&s;elf, he enumerated his
actions; he repeated, in haughty terms, in what manner he had ravaged Laconia,
re-e&s;tabli&s;hed Me&s;&s;e|nia, and re-united Arcadia in one body. He
concluded with &s;aying, That he &s;hould die with plea&s;ure, if the Thebans
would renounce the &s;ole glory of tho&s;e actions to him, and declare that he
had done them by his own authority, and without their participation. All 
<PB N="27" REF="29"> the voices were in his favour; and he returned from his
trial, as he u&s;ed to return from battle, with glory and univer&s;al
applau&s;e. Such dig|nity has true valour, that it in a manner &s;eizes the
admiration of mankind by force. This manner of reproaching them had &s;o good
an effect, that his enemies declined any further pro&s;ecution; and he, with
his colleague were honourably acquitted. His enemies, however, jealous of his
glory, with a de&s;ign to affront him, cau&s;ed him to be elected the city
&s;caven|ger; he accepted the place with thanks, and a&s;&s;erted, That
in&s;tead of deriving honour from the office, he would give it dignity in his
turn.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Spartans, &s;truck with con&s;ternation at
their late defeats, applied to the Athenians for &s;uccour; who, after &s;ome
he&s;i|tation, determined to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with all their forces; and a
&s;light advantage the Spartans had gained over the Arcadians, in which they
did not lo&s;e a man, gave a promi&s;ing dawn of &s;ucce&s;s. The Per&s;ian
king was al&s;o applied to for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the confederacy again&s;t
Thebes; but Pelopidas, undertaking an emba&s;&s;y to that court, fru&s;trated
their purpo&s;e, and induced that great monarch to &s;tand neuter.</P>
<P>Thebes being thus rid of &s;o powerful an ene|my, had le&s;s fears
of with&s;tanding the confe|deracy <PB N="28" REF="30"> of Sparta and Athens:
but a new and an unexpected power was now growing up again&s;t them; a power
which was one day about to &s;wallow up the liberties of Greece, and give laws
to all mankind.</P>
<P>Some years before this, Ja&s;on the king of Pherae, was cho&s;en
general of the The&s;&s;alians by the con&s;ent of the people; he was at the
head of an army of above eight thou&s;and hor&s;e, and twenty thou&s;and heavy
armed foot, with|out reckoning light infantry; and might have undertaken any
thing with &s;uch a body of di&s;|ciplined and intrepid troops, who had an
entire confidence in the valour and conduct of their commander. Death prevented
his de&s;igns; he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by per&s;ons who had con&s;pired his
de&s;truction. His two brothers, Polydorus and Poliphron, were &s;ub&s;tituted
in his place. Again&s;t him Pelopidas was &s;ent. The latter of whom killed the
other, for the &s;ake of reign|ing alone, and was &s;oon after killed him&s;elf
by Alexander of Pherae, who &s;eized the government, under the pretence of
revenging the death of Polydorus his father. The Theban general &s;oon
compelled Alexander to make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him; and attempted by mild
u&s;age to change the natural brutality of his di&s;po&s;ition. But Alexander,
long addicted to a debauched life, <PB N="29" REF="31"> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of in&s;atiable avarice, &s;ecretly with|drew from all con&s;traint, re&s;olved
to &s;eize an opportunity of revenge. It was not till &s;ome time after that
this offered; for Pelopidas be|ing appointed amba&s;&s;ador to Alexander, who
was at that time at the head of a powerful ar|my, he was &s;eized upon, and
made pri&s;oner, contrary to all the laws of nations and huma|nity. It was in
vain that the Thebans com|plained of this infraction; it was in vain that they
&s;ent a powerful army, but headed by in|different generals, to revenge the
in&s;ult: their army returned without effect, and Alexander treated his
pri&s;oners with the utmo&s;t &s;everity. It was left for Epaminondas only to
bring the tyrant to rea&s;on. Entering The&s;&s;alia at the head of a powerful
army, his name &s;pread &s;uch terror, that the tyrant offered terms of
&s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, and delivered up Pelopidas from pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Pelopidas was &s;carce freed from confinement, when he re&s;olved to
puni&s;h the tyrant for his perfidy and breach of faith. He led a body of
troops again&s;t Alexander, to a place called Cy|nocephalus, where a bloody
battle en&s;ued, in which the Thebans were victorious; but Pelo|pidas was
unfortunately &s;lain: his countrymen con&s;idered their &s;ucce&s;&s;es very
dearly earned <PB N="30" REF="32"> which they had obtained by his death. The
la|mentations for him were general; his funeral was magnificent, and his
prai&s;es boundle&s;s. Alexander him&s;elf &s;oon after was killed by Theba his
wife, and his three brothers, who, long &s;hocked at his cruelties, re&s;olved
to rid the world of &s;uch a mon&s;ter. The account has it, that he &s;lept
every night, guarded by a dog, in a chamber which was a&s;cended by a ladder.
Theba allured away the dog, and covered the &s;teps of the ladder with wool to
prevent noi&s;e, and then, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her brothers, &s;tabbed
him in &s;everal parts of his body.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the war between the The|bans and the Spartans
proceeded with unabated vigour. The Theban troops were headed by their
favourite general Epaminondas; tho&s;e of Sparta by Age&s;ilaus, the only man
in Greece that was then able to oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t attempt of Epaminondas in this campaign, marked his
great abilities, and his &s;kill in the art of war. Being informed that
Age&s;ilaus had begun his march with his army, and had left but few citizens to
defend Sparta at home, he marched directly thither by night, with a de&s;ign to
take the city by &s;urprize, as it had neither walls nor troops to defend it;
but luckily Age&s;ilaus was appri&s;ed of his de&s;ign, <PB N="31" REF="33">
and di&s;patched one of his hor&s;e to advi&s;e the city of its danger; &s;oon
after arriving with a powerful &s;uccour in per&s;on, he had &s;carce en|tered
the town, when the Thebans were &s;een pa&s;&s;ing the Eurotas, and coming on
again&s;t the city. Epaminondas, who perceived that his de&s;ign was
di&s;covered, thought it incum|bent on him not to retire without &s;ome
attempt. He therefore made his troops advance, and making u&s;e of valour
in&s;tead of &s;tratagem, he attacked the city at &s;everal quarters,
penetrated as far as the public place, and &s;eized that part of Sparta which
lay upon the hither &s;ide of the river. Age&s;ilaus made head every where, and
defended him&s;elf with much more valour than could be expected from his years.
He &s;aw well that it was not now a time, as before, to &s;pare him&s;elf, and
to act only upon the defen|&s;ive; but that he had need of all his courage and
daring, and to fight with all the vigour of de&s;pair. His &s;on Archidamus, at
the head of the Spartan youth, behaved with incredible valour whenever the
danger was greate&s;t; and, with his &s;mall troop, &s;topped the enemy, and
made head again&s;t them on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>A young Spartan, named I&s;adas, di&s;tingui&s;h|ed him&s;elf
particularly in this action. He was very hand&s;ome in the face, perfectly well
&s;haped, <PB N="32" REF="34"> of an advantageous &s;tature, and in the flower
of his youth; he had neither armour nor cloaths upon his body, which &s;hone
with oil; he held a &s;pear in one hand, and a &s;word in the other. In this
condition he quitted his hou&s;e with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s; and, breaking
through the pre&s;s of the Spartans that fought, he threw him&s;elf upon the
enemy, gave mortal wounds at every blow, and laid all at his feet who
op|po&s;ed him, without receiving any hurt him|&s;elf. Whether the enemy were
di&s;mayed at &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a &s;ight, or, &s;ays Plutarch, the gods
took plea&s;ure in pre&s;erving him upon account of his extraordinary valour;
it is &s;aid, the Ephori decreed him a crown after the battle, in honour of his
exploits; but afterwards fined him a thou&s;and drachmas, for having expo&s;ed
him&s;elf to &s;o great a danger without arms.</P>
<P>Epaminondas, thus failing in his de&s;ign, was re&s;olved, before he
laid down his com|mand, which was near expiring, to give the Lacedemonians and
Athenians battle, as they followed him clo&s;e in the rear.</P>
<P>The Greeks had never fought among them|&s;elves with more numerous
armies. The La|cedemonians con&s;i&s;ted of more than twenty thou&s;and foot,
and two thou&s;and hor&s;e; the <PB N="33" REF="35"> Thebans of thirty
thou&s;and foot, and three thou&s;and hor&s;e. Upon the right wing of the
former, the Mantineans, Arcadians, and La|cedemonians were po&s;ted in one
line; the Eleans and Achaeans, who were the weake&s;t of their troops, had the
centre; and the Athe|nians alone compo&s;ed the left wing. In the other army,
the Thebans and Arcadians were on the left, the Argives on the right, and the
other allies in the centre: the cavalry on each &s;ide were di&s;po&s;ed in the
wings.</P>
<P>The Theban general marched in the &s;ame order of battle in which he
intended to fight, that he might not be obliged, when he came up with the
enemy, to lo&s;e, in the di&s;po&s;ition of his army, a time which cannot be
recovered when lo&s;t in great enterprizes.</P>
<P>He did not march directly, and with his front to the enemy, but in a
column upon the hills, with his left wing foremo&s;t; as if he did not intend
to fight that day. When he was over-again&s;t them, at a quarter of a league's
di|&s;tance, he made the troops halt, and lay down their arms, as if he
de&s;igned to encamp there. The enemy, in effect, were deceived by his &s;tand;
and reckoning no longer upon a battle, they quitted their arms, di&s;per&s;ed
them&s;elves a|bout the camp, and &s;uffered that ardour to be ex|tingui&s;hed,
<PB N="34" REF="36"> which a near approach of a battle is wont to kindle in the
hearts of the &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Epaminondas, however, by &s;uddenly wheel|ing his troops to the
right, having changed his column into a line, and having drawn out the choice
troops, whom he had expre&s;sly po&s;ted in front upon his march, he made them
double their files upon the front of his left wing, to add to its &s;trength,
and to put it into a condition to attack in a point the Lacedemonian phalanx,
which, by the movement he had made, faced it directly. He ordered the centre
and right wing of his army to move very &s;low, and to halt before they came up
with the enemy, that he might not hazard the event of the battle upon troops of
which he had no great opinion.</P>
<P>He expected to decide the victory by that body of cho&s;en troops
which he commanded in per&s;on, and which he had formed into a co|lumn to
attack the enemy in a wedge-like point. He a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf, that if he
could penetrate the Lacedemonian phalanx, in which the enemy's principal force
con&s;i&s;ted, he &s;hould not find it difficult to rout the re&s;t of the
army, by charging upon the right and left with his victorious troops.</P>
<P>But that he might prevent the Athenians in the left wing from coming
to the &s;upport of <PB N="35" REF="37"> their right again&s;t his intended
attack, he made a detachment of his hor&s;e and foot advance out of the line,
and po&s;ted them upon a ri&s;ing ground, in readine&s;s to flank the
Athenians, as well to cover his right as to alarm them and give them rea&s;on
to apprehend being taken in flank and rear them&s;elves, if they advanced to
&s;u&s;tain their right.</P>
<P>After having di&s;po&s;ed his whole army in this manner, he moved on
to charge the enemy with the whole weight of his column. They were &s;trangely
&s;urprized when they &s;aw Epa|minondas advance towards them in this order;
and re&s;umed their arms, bridled their hor&s;es, and made all the ha&s;te they
could to their ranks.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Epaminondas marched again&s;t the enemy, the cavalry that
covered his flank on the left, the be&s;t at that time in Greece, en|tirely
compo&s;ed of Thebans and The&s;&s;alians, had orders to attack the enemy's
hor&s;e. The Theban general, whom nothing e&s;caped, had artfully be&s;towed
bow-men, &s;lingers, and dart-men in the intervals of his hor&s;e, in order to
begin the di&s;orders of the enemy's cavalry, by a previous di&s;charge of a
&s;hower of arrows, &s;tones, and javelins upon them. The other army had
neglected to take the &s;ame precau|tion; <PB N="36" REF="38"> and had made
another fault, not le&s;s con&s;iderable, in giving as much depth to the
&s;quadrons as if they had been a phalanx. By this means their hor&s;e were
incapable of &s;up|porting long the charge of the Thebans. Af|ter having made
&s;everal ineffectual attacks with great lo&s;s, they were obliged to retire
behind their infantry.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Epaminondas, with his body of foot, had charged
the Lacedemonian phalanx. The troops fought on both &s;ides with incredible
ardour, both the Thebans and Lacedemonians being re&s;olved to peri&s;h ra|ther
than yield the glory of arms to their ri|vals. They began with fighting with
the &s;pear; and tho&s;e fir&s;t arms being &s;oon broken in the fury of the
combat, they charged each other &s;word in hand. The re&s;i&s;tance was equally
ob&s;tinate; and the &s;laughter very great on both &s;ides. The troops
de&s;pi&s;ing danger, and de&s;iring only to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by
the greatne&s;s of their actions, cho&s;e rather to die in their ranks, than to
lo&s;e a &s;tep of their ground.</P>
<P>The furious &s;laughter on both &s;ides, having continued a great
while, without the victory inclining to either, Epaminondas, to force it to
declare for him, thought it his duty to make an extraordinary effort in
per&s;on, without re|gard <PB N="37" REF="39"> to the danger of his own life.
He form|ed therefore a troop of the brave&s;t and mo&s;t determinate about him;
and, putting him&s;elf at the head of them, made a vigorous charge upon the
enemy, where the battle was mo&s;t warm, and wounded the general of the
Lace|demonians with the fir&s;t javelin he threw. This troop, by his example,
having wounded or killed all that &s;tood in their way, broke and penetrated
the phalanx. The Lacedemonians, di&s;mayed by the pre&s;ence of Epaminondas,
and overpowered by the weight of that intrepid party, were reduced to give
ground. The gro&s;s of the Theban troops, animated by their general's example
and &s;ucce&s;s, drove back the enemy upon his right and left, and made great
&s;laughter of them. But &s;ome troops of the Spartans, perceiving that
Epaminondas aban|doned him&s;elf too much to his ardour, &s;ud|denly rallied,
and, returning to the fight, charged him with a &s;hower of javelins. Whil&s;t
he kept off part of tho&s;e darts, &s;hunned &s;ome of them, fenced off others,
and was fighting with the mo&s;t heroic valour, to a&s;&s;ure the victory to
his army, a Spartan, named Callicrates, gave him a mortal wound with a javelin
in the brea&s;t acro&s;s his cuira&s;s. The wood of the ja|velin being broke
off, and the iron head con|tinuing <PB N="38" REF="40"> in the wound, the
torment was in&s;up|portable, and he fell immediately. The battle began around
him with new fury; the one &s;ide u&s;ing their utmo&s;t endeavours to take him
alive, and the other to &s;ave him. The The|bans gained their point at la&s;t,
and carried him off, after having put the enemy to flight.</P>
<P>After &s;everal different movements, and al|ternative lo&s;&s;es and
advantages, the troops on both &s;ides &s;tood &s;till, and re&s;ted upon their
arms; and the trumpets of the two armies, as if by con&s;ent, &s;ounded the
retreat at the &s;ame time. Each party pretended to the victo|ry, and erected a
trophy; the Thebans, be|cau&s;e they had defeated the right wing, and re|mained
ma&s;ters of the field of battle; the Athenians, becau&s;e they had cut the
detach|ment in pieces. And, from this point of ho|nour, both &s;ides refu&s;ed
at fir&s;t to a&s;k leave to bury their dead; which, with the ancients, was
confe&s;&s;ing their defeat. The Lacedemo|nians, however, &s;ent fir&s;t to
demand that per|mi&s;&s;ion; after which, the re&s;t had no thoughts but of
paying the la&s;t duties to the &s;lain.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Epaminondas had been carried into the camp. The
&s;urgeons, after having examined the wound, declared, that he would expire as
&s;oon as the head of the dart <PB N="39" REF="41"> was drawn out of it.
Tho&s;e words gave all that were pre&s;ent the utmo&s;t &s;orrow and
afflic|tion, who were incon&s;olable on &s;eeing &s;o great a man upon the
point of expiring. For him, the only concern he expre&s;&s;ed was about his
arms, and the &s;ucce&s;s of the battle. When they &s;hewed him his &s;hield,
and a&s;&s;ured him that the Thebans had gained the victory, turn|ing towards
his friends with a calm and &s;e|rene air, 
<Q REND="inline">"All then is well,"</Q> &s;aid he; and &s;oon after,
upon drawing the head of the ja|velin out of his body, he expired in the arms
of Victory.</P>
<P>As the glory of Thebes ro&s;e with Epami|nondas, &s;o it fell with
him; and he is, per|haps, the only in&s;tance of one man's being able to
in&s;pire his country with military glory, and lead it on to conque&s;t,
without having had a pre|dece&s;&s;or, or leaving an imitator of his
example.</P>
<P>The battle of Mantinea was the greate&s;t that ever was fought by
Grecians again&s;t Grecians; the whole &s;trength of the country being drawn
out, and ranged according to their different in|tere&s;ts; and it was fought
with an ob&s;tinacy equal to the importance of it, which was the fixing the
empire of Greece. And this mu&s;t of cour&s;e have been transferred to the
The|bans upon their victory, if they had not lo&s;t <PB N="40" REF="42"> the
fruits of it by the death of their gene|ral, who was the &s;oul of all their
coun&s;els and de&s;igns. This bla&s;ted all their hopes, and put out their
&s;udden blaze of power, almo&s;t as &s;oon as it was kindled. However, they
did not pre&s;ently give up their preten&s;ions; they were &s;till ranked among
the leading &s;tates, and made &s;everal further &s;truggles; but they were
faint and ineffectual; and &s;uch as were rather for life and being, than for
&s;uperiority and do|minion. A peace, therefore, was propo&s;ed; which was
ratified by all the &s;tates of Greece, except Sparta; the conditions of which
were, that every &s;tate &s;hould maintain what they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, and
hold it independent of any other power.</P>
<P>A &s;tate of repo&s;e en&s;ued this peace; in which the Grecian
powers &s;eemed to &s;lacken from their former animo&s;ities; and if we except
an expedition under Age&s;ilaus into Egypt, whi|ther he went to a&s;&s;i&s;t
Tachos, who had u&s;urp|ed that kingdom, and in which he died, there was little
done for &s;everal years following. The Athenians, more particularly, when they
found them&s;elves delivered from him who kept up their emulation, grew
indolent a nd re|mi&s;s, and abandoned them&s;elves to their ea&s;e and
plea&s;ure, being wholly taken up with <PB N="41" REF="43"> &s;hews, &s;ports
and fe&s;tivals. They were na|turally too much addicted to the&s;e
amu&s;e|ments; and they had formerly been encoura|ged in them by Pericles, who
knew how to lead them by their inclinations, and took this method to ingratiate
him&s;elf, and to di|vert them from in&s;pecting too narrowly into his
admini&s;tration. But they now carried their diver&s;ions to a much higher
pitch of ex|travagance. They had &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;tage, that it
&s;tifled in them all other thoughts either of bu&s;ine&s;s or of glory. In
&s;hort, the decorations, and other charges attending the theatre, were &s;o
exce&s;&s;ive, that Plutarch &s;ays, It co&s;t more to repre&s;ent &s;ome of
the famous pieces of Sophocles and Euripides, than it had done to carry on the
war again&s;t the bar|barians. And, in order to &s;upport this charge, they
&s;eized upon the fund which had been &s;et apart for the war, with a
prohibition, upon pain of death, ever to advi&s;e the applying of it to any
other purpo&s;e. They not only re|ver&s;ed this decree, but went as far the
other way, making it death to propo&s;e the re&s;toring the fund to the u&s;es
to which it had before been appropriated, under the &s;ame penalties. By
diverting the cour&s;e of the &s;upplies in &s;o ex|traordinary a manner, and
entertaining the <PB N="42" REF="44"> idle citizen at the expence of the
&s;oldier and marinet, they &s;eemed to have no remains of that &s;pirit and
vigour which they had exert|ed in the Per&s;ian wars, when they demoli&s;hed
their hou&s;es to furni&s;h out a navy; and when the women &s;toned a man to
death, who pro|po&s;ed to appea&s;e the Great King (as he was called) by paying
tribute, and doing homage.</P>
<P>In this general remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed,
that their allies would treat them with the re&s;pect they demanded. Mo&s;t of
the &s;tates, that had hitherto been in alliance with them, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. J. C.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">58.</NOTE> and had found &s;ecurity
under their protection, took up arms again&s;t them. In reducing the&s;e,
Chabrias, Iphicrates, and Timotheus gained great reputation; and are
&s;uppo&s;ed to have been con&s;ummate generals; but their &s;ucce&s;&s;es are
too minute to rank them among the cla&s;s of eminent commanders; and whatever
their &s;kill might have been, there wanted a great occa&s;ion for its
di&s;play. This war opened with the &s;iege of Chio, in which the Athenians
were repul&s;ed; and Cha|brias, unwilling to abandon his ve&s;&s;el, pre|ferred
death to flight. The &s;iege of Byzan|tium followed; before which, the fleet of
the contending powers was di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm; in con&s;equence of
which, the Athenian ge|nerals <PB N="43" REF="45"> were recalled. Timotheus was
fined a great &s;um; but, being too poor to pay, he went into voluntary
bani&s;hment. Iphi|crates was al&s;o obliged to an&s;wer for him|&s;elf, but
got off by his eloquence; and, in the mean time, the affairs of Athens
&s;ucceeded but ill under the guidance of Charis, who was left &s;ole
commander. A peace was con|cluded, whereby every city and people were left to
the full enjoyment of their liberty: and thus the war of the allies ended,
after having continued three years.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, a power was grow|ing up in Greece,
hitherto unob&s;erved, but now too con&s;picuous and formidable to be
over|looked in the general picture; this was that of the Macedonians; a people
hitherto ob&s;cure, and in a manner barbarous; and who, though warlike and
hardy, had never yet pre&s;umed to intermeddle in the affairs of Greece: but
now &s;everal circum&s;tances concurred to rai&s;e them from ob&s;curity, and
to involve them in mea&s;ures, which, by degrees, wrought a tho|rough change in
the &s;tate of Greece; it will be nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to begin with a
&s;hort account of their power and origin, before we enter into a detail of
that con&s;picuous part, which they afterwards performed on the theatre of the
world.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. From the Birth to the Death of PHILIP King of
MACEDON.</HEAD>
<P>THE people of Macedon were hitherto con|&s;idered as making no part
of the Grecian con|federacy; they were looked upon as borderers, as men, in a
mea&s;ure, &s;emi-barbarous; who boa&s;ted indeed of taking their origin from
the Greeks; but who hitherto neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their politene&s;s, nor
enjoyed their freedom: they had little or no intercour&s;e with their
mother-country; they had contracted the ha|bits and manners of the natives
where they were &s;ettled, and from thence they were treat|ed with &s;imilar
di&s;re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t king who is mentioned with any degree of certainty to
have reigned in Macedo|nia, was Caranus, by birth an Argive, and &s;aid to be
the &s;ixteenth in de&s;cent from Hercules. It was upon this foundation, that
Philip afterwards grounded his preten&s;ions to be of the race of Hercules, and
a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf divine ho|nours. Caranus, therefore, is commonly
repu|ted <PB N="45" REF="47"> to have led forth a body of his country|men, by
the advice of the oracle, into the&s;e parts where he &s;ettled, and made
him&s;elf king. Caranus having, according to the general ac|count, reigned
twenty-eight years; the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was continued after him to the times
we are now treating of. But there is very little worth notice recorded of
the&s;e kings; they being chiefly employed in defending them&s;elves again&s;t
the incur&s;ions of their neighbours. And as to their dome&s;tic affairs, they
were remark|able only for the frequent murders and u&s;ur|pations which
happened in the royal family.</P>
<P>Amintas, father of Philip, began to reign the third year of the
ninety-&s;ixth Olympiad. Having the very year after been warmly at|tacked by
the Illyrians, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great part of his kingdom, which
he thought it &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for him ever to recover again, he
addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Olynthians; and, in order to engage them the
more firmly in his intere&s;t, he had given up to them a con&s;ider|able track
of land in the neighbourhood of their city. He was re&s;tored to the throne by
the The&s;&s;alians; upon which he was de|&s;irous of re&s;uming the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands, which nothing but the ill &s;ituation of his
affairs had obliged him to re&s;ign to the Olynthians. <PB N="46" REF="48">
This occa&s;ioned a war; but Amintas not be|ing &s;trong enough to make head
&s;ingly again&s;t &s;o powerful a people, the Greeks and the Athe|nians, in
particular, &s;ent him &s;uccours, and enabled him to weaken the power of the
Olyn|thians, who threatened him with a total and impending ruin.</P>
<P>Amintas died, after having reigned twenty-four years; he left three
legitimate children, namely, Alexander, Perdicas, and Philip. Alex|ander, the
elde&s;t &s;on, reigned but one year. Perdicas, the &s;econd brother, was
oppo&s;ed by Pau&s;anias, who began, by &s;eizing &s;ome for|tre&s;&s;es; but,
by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Iphicrates, the Athenian general, the u&s;urper was
expelled, and Perdicas the lawful &s;overeign confirmed on the throne. He did
not, however, long con|tinue in tranquillity. Ptolemy, a natural &s;on of
Amintas, laid claim to the crown, and di&s;|puted his title; which, by mutual
con&s;ent, was referred to Pelopidas the Theban, a man more revered for his
probity than his valour. Pelo|pidas determined in favour of Perdicas; and,
having judged it nece&s;&s;ary to take pledges on both &s;ides, in order to
oblige the two compe|titors to ob&s;erve the articles of the treaty ac|cepted
by them, among other ho&s;tages, he car|ried Philip with him to Thebes, where
he <PB N="47" REF="49"> re&s;ided &s;everal years. He was then ten years of
age. Eurydice, at her leaving this much-loved &s;on, earne&s;tly be&s;ought
Pelopidas to procure him an education worthy of his birth, and of the city to
which he was going, an ho&s;tage. Pelopidas placed him with Epaminondas, who
had a celebrated Pythagorean philo&s;opher in his hou&s;e for the education of
his &s;on. Philip improved greatly by the in&s;tructions of his pre|ceptor, and
much more by tho&s;e of Epaminon|das, under whom he undoubtedly made &s;ome
campaigns, though no mention is made of this. He could not po&s;&s;ibly have
had a more ex|cellent ma&s;ter, whether for war, or the con|duct of life; for
this illu&s;trious Theban was, at the &s;ame time, a great philo&s;opher; that
is to &s;ay, a wi&s;e and virtuous man, and a great commander, as well as a
great &s;tate&s;man. Philip was very proud of being his pupil, and propo&s;ed
him as a model to him&s;elf; mo&s;t hap|py, could he have copied him perfectly!
Per|haps he borrowed from Epaminondas his acti|vity in war, and his promptitude
in improving occa&s;ions; which, however, formed but a very incon&s;iderable
part of the merit of that illu|&s;trious per&s;onage. But, with regard to his
temperance, his ju&s;tice, his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, his &s;incerity, his
magnanimity, his clemency, <PB N="48" REF="50"> which rendered him truly great,
the&s;e were virtues which Philip had not received from nature, and did not
acquire by imitation.</P>
<P>The Thebans did not know that they were then forming and educating
the mo&s;t danger|ous enemy of Greece. After Philip had &s;pent nine or ten
years in their city, the news of a revolution in Macedon made him re&s;olve to
leave Thebes clande&s;tinely. Accordingly he &s;tole away, made the utmo&s;t
expedition, and found the Macedonians greatly &s;urprized at ha|ving lo&s;t
their king Perdicas, who had been killed in a great battle by the Illyrians;
but much more &s;o, to find they had as many ene|mies as neighbours. The
Illyrians were on the point of returning into the kingdom with a much greater
force; the Peonians infe&s;ted it with perpetual incur&s;ions; the Thracians
were determined to place Pau&s;anias on the throne, who had not abandoned his
preten|&s;ions; and the Athenians were bringing Ar|gaeus, whom Mantias, their
general, was or|dered to &s;upport with a &s;trong fleet, and a con|&s;iderable
body of troops. Macedonia at that time wanted a prince of years to govern; and
had only a child, Amintas, the &s;on of Perdi|cas, and lawful heir of the
crown. Philip governed the kingdom for &s;ome time, by the <PB N="49" REF="51">
title of Guardian to the Prince; but the &s;ub|jects, ju&s;tly alarmed,
depo&s;ed the nephew in favour of the uncle; and in&s;tead of the heir, whom
nature had given them, &s;et him upon the throne whom the pre&s;ent conjuncture
of affairs required, per&s;uaded that the laws of nece&s;&s;ity are &s;uperior
to all others. According|ly, Philip, at twenty-four years of age, a&s;|cended
the throne, the fir&s;t year of the 105th Olympiad.</P>
<P>Never did the pre&s;ent condition of the Ma|cedonians require a man
of more prudence and activity. They were &s;urrounded with as many enemies as
they had neighbours. The Illyrians, &s;lu&s;hed with their late victory, were
preparing to march again&s;t them with a great army. The Paeonians were making
daily incur&s;ions upon them; and, at the &s;ame time, the title to the crown
was conte&s;ted by Pau&s;anias and Argaeus; the former whereof was &s;upported
by the Thra|cians, and the latter by the Athenians; who, for that purpo&s;e,
had &s;ent out a good fleet, and three thou&s;and land-men.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, with &s;o many enemies on his hands
at once, and that before he was &s;ettled on the throne, his fir&s;t care was
to make &s;ure of his own people, to gain their affections, and to rai&s;e
their &s;pirits; for they <PB N="50" REF="52"> were very much di&s;heartened,
having lo&s;t above four thou&s;and men in the late action with the Illyrians.
He &s;ucceeded in the&s;e points, by the artfulne&s;s of his addre&s;s, and the
force of his elo|quence, of which he was a great ma&s;ter. His next &s;tep was
to train and exerci&s;e them, and reform their di&s;cipline; and it was at this
time that he in&s;tituted the famous Macedonian phalanx, which did &s;o much
execution. It was an im|provement upon the ancient manner of fight|ing among
the Grecians, who generally drew up their foot &s;o clo&s;e, as to &s;tand the
&s;hock of the enemy without being broken. The com|plete phalanx was thought to
contain above &s;ixteen thou&s;and men; though it was al&s;o taken in general
for any company or party of &s;ol|diers, and frequently for the whole body of
foot. But this of Philip's invention is de&s;cri|bed by Polybius to be a long
&s;quare, con&s;i&s;t|ing of eight thou&s;and pike-men, &s;ixteen deep, and
five hundred in front; the men &s;tanding &s;o clo&s;e together, that the pikes
of the fifth rank were extended three foot beyond the line of the front. The
re&s;t, who&s;e di&s;tance from the front made their pikes u&s;ele&s;s,
re&s;ted them upon the &s;houlders of tho&s;e who &s;tood before them, and &s;o
locking them together in file, pre&s;&s;ed forward to &s;upport and pu&s;h on
the former <PB N="51" REF="53"> ranks, whereby the a&s;&s;ault was rendered
more violent and irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>When Philip had made &s;ome proper regu|lation of his affairs at
home, he began to look abroad, in order to divert the &s;torms which threatened
him from all quarters. By money and promi&s;es, he made up matters for the
pre&s;ent with &s;uch of his enemies as lay neare&s;t to him; and then turned
his forces again&s;t the Athenians, who were marched up to Methone, to
a&s;&s;i&s;t Argaeus. He gave them battle, and defeated them; and the death of
Argaeus, who was killed in the action, put an end to that di&s;pute: for he
permitted the Athenians, when they were in his power, to return home. This
in&s;tance of his moderation, gained &s;o far upon them, that they &s;oon after
concluded a peace with him; which yet he ob&s;erved no longer than it &s;erved
his de&s;ign of &s;ecuring the other part of his dominions.</P>
<P>Accordingly, he marched northward, where he declared war again&s;t
the Paeonians, and &s;ubdued them; then fell upon the Illyrians, and having
killed above &s;even thou&s;and of them in a pitched battle, obliged them to
re&s;tore all their conque&s;ts in Macedonia. He had al&s;o ob|&s;tructed the
pa&s;&s;age of the Tha&s;ians; but yet did not think it &s;ufficiently
&s;ecured, without making <PB N="52" REF="54"> him&s;elf ma&s;ter of
Amphipolis, which was very commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated on the river Strymon, and
was the key of that &s;ide of his dominions. He knew the importance of it,
therefore he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of it in the beginning of his reign.
This was the ground of his quarrel with the Athe|nians; who claimed it as one
of their colonies, and made &s;uch a point of it, that their &s;etting up
Argaeus again&s;t him, was not &s;o much for his own &s;ake, as for the credit
of impo&s;ing a king upon the Macedonians; as it was with a view to get the
city re&s;tored to them by his means, in ca&s;e he &s;hould have &s;ucceeded in
his inten|tions. Philip was &s;en&s;ible of their drift, and finding it
nece&s;&s;ary at that time to keep &s;ome mea&s;ures with them, would neither
keep the place him&s;elf, nor let them have it; but took a middle cour&s;e, and
declared it a free city; thereby leaving the inhabitants to throw off their
dependence on their old ma&s;ters, and making it appear to be their own act.
But the city continued no longer in this &s;tate, than until he &s;ound
him&s;elf at liberty to make a more tho|rough conque&s;t of it; which at this
time he ea&s;ily effected, through the remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Athenians, who
refu&s;ed to &s;end any relief to it; alledging, in their excu&s;e, that it
would be a breach of the peace, which they had concluded <PB N="53" REF="55">
with Philip the year before. But the truth is, he tricked them out of it by a
promi&s;e of deli|vering it up to them. But in&s;tead of keeping his word with
them, he made further encroach|ments, by &s;eizing on Pydna and Potidea; the
latter of which being garri&s;oned by Athenians, he drew them out, and &s;ent
them home; but di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with &s;uch marks of civility, as &s;hewed
that he avoided coming to an open rup|ture with that &s;tate, at lea&s;t until
his de&s;igns were more ripe for it; though at the &s;ame time he did what he
could to weaken them, and drive them out of his neighbourhood. Pydna, with the
territory belonging to it, he gave up to the Olynthians, who were his father's
inve|terate enemies. His hands were too full at this time to revive the quarrel
again&s;t &s;o rich and powerful a city; which, for three years together, had
with&s;tood the united forces of Sparta and Macedonia; he therefore cho&s;e to
buy their friend&s;hip for the pre&s;ent, and to amu&s;e them by the delivery
of this town, as he had done the Athenians by the peace, until he could attack
them at more advantage. In this &s;tep al&s;o he over-reached the Athenians;
who were at the &s;ame time courting the alliance of the Olynthians, in order
to maintain their footing in tho&s;e parts. Which &s;ide &s;oever the 
<PB N="54" REF="56"> Olynthians inclined to, they were &s;trong enough to turn
the balance; and therefore, the gain|ing them became a matter of great
contention between Philip and the Athenians.</P>
<P>From thence he proceeded to &s;eize the city of Crenides, which had
been built two years before, and then called it Philippi, from his own name. It
was here that he di&s;covered a gold mine, which every year produced an hundred
and forty-four thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. This, which was an immen&s;e &s;um
for that age, was much more &s;erviceable than fleets or armies, in fighting
his battles; and he &s;eldom failed u&s;ing it in every negociation. It is
&s;aid, that con&s;ulting the oracle at Delphos, concerning the &s;ucce&s;s of
an intended expedition, he was an&s;wered by the prie&s;te&s;s, That with
&s;ilver &s;pears he &s;hould con|quer all things. He took the advice of the
oracle, and his &s;ucce&s;s was an&s;werable to its wi&s;dom: indeed, he was
le&s;s proud of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of a battle, than of a negociation; well
knowing, that his &s;oldiers and generals &s;hared in the one, but that the
honour of the latter was wholly his own.</P>
<P>But a larger field was now opening to his ambition. The mutual
divi&s;ions of the &s;tates of Greece were at no time wholly cemented, and they
broke out now upon a very particular <PB N="55" REF="57"> occa&s;ion. The
fir&s;t cau&s;e of the rupture, (which was afterwards called the Sacred War)
aro&s;e from the Phocians having ploughed up a piece of ground belonging to the
temple of Apollo at Delphos. Again&s;t this all the neigh|bouring &s;tates
exclaimed as a &s;acrilege: they were cited before the council of Amphyctions,
who particularly took cognizance of &s;acred matters; they were ca&s;t, and an
heavy fine was impo&s;ed upon them. This the Phocians were unable to pay; they
refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the decree: they alledged, that the care and
pa|tronage of the temple anciently belonged to them; and, to vindicate this,
they quoted a precedent from Homer.</P>
<P>Philomelas, one of their chief citizens, was principally
in&s;trumental in encouraging them to arms: he rai&s;ed their ardour, and was
ap|pointed their general. He fir&s;t applied him|&s;elf to the Spartans, who
had likewi&s;e been fined by the Amphyctions, at the in&s;tance of the Thebans,
after the battle of Leuctra, for having &s;eized the Cadmea: for this rea&s;on
they were very well di&s;po&s;ed to join with him, but did not yet think it
proper to declare them|&s;elves: however, they encouraged his de&s;ign, and
&s;upplied him under-hand with money; by which means he rai&s;ed troops, and,
without <PB N="56" REF="58"> much difficulty, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
temple. The chief re&s;i&s;tance he met with in the neigh|bourhood, was from
the Locrians; but having wor&s;ted them, he era&s;ed the decree of the
Amphyctions, which was in&s;cribed on the pil|lars of the temple. However, to
&s;trengthen his authority, and give a colour to his proceedings, he thought it
convenient to con&s;ult the oracle, and to procure an an&s;wer in his favour.
But when he applied to the prie&s;te&s;s for that pur|po&s;e, &s;he refu&s;ed
to officiate, until being inti|midated by his threats, &s;he told him, the god
left him at liberty to act as he plea&s;ed; which he looked upon as a good
an&s;wer, and as &s;uch took care to divulge it.</P>
<P>The Amphyctions meeting a &s;econd time, a re&s;olution was formed
to declare war again&s;t the Phocians. Mo&s;t of the Grecian nations engaged in
this quarrel, and &s;ided with the one or the other party. The Boeotians, the
Locrians, The&s;&s;a|lians, and &s;everal other neighbouring people, declared
in favour of the god; whil&s;t Sparta, Athens, and &s;ome other cities of
Pelopone&s;us, joined with the Phocians. Philomelas had not yet touched the
trea&s;ures of the temple; but being afterwards not &s;o &s;crupulous, he
be|lieved that the riches of the god could not be better employed, than in the
deity's defence; <PB N="57" REF="59"> for he gave this &s;pecious name to this
&s;acri|legious attempt: and being enabled, by this fre&s;h &s;upply, to double
the pay of his &s;oldiers, he rai&s;ed a very con&s;iderable body of
troops.</P>
<P>Several battles were fought; and the &s;ucce&s;s for &s;ome time
&s;eemed doubtful on both &s;ides. Every one knows how much religious wars are
to be dreaded, and the prodigious lengths which a fal&s;e zeal, when veiled
with &s;o venerable a name, is apt to go. The Thebans having in a rencounter
taken &s;everal pri&s;oners, condemned them all to die, as &s;acrilegious
wretches who were excommunicated: the Phocians did the &s;ame, by way of
repri&s;al. The&s;e had at fir&s;t gained &s;everal advantages; but having been
defeated in a great battle, Philomelas their leader being clo&s;ely attacked on
an eminence from which there was no retreating, defended him&s;elf for a long
time with invincible bravery; which however not availing, he threw him&s;elf
headlong from a rock, in order to avoid the torments he mu&s;t undoubtedly have
undergone, had he fallen alive into the hands of his ene|mies. Oenomarchus was
his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and took upon him the command of the forces.</P>
<P>Philip thought it mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with his in|tere&s;t to
remain neuter in this general move|ment of the Greeks, in favour either of the 
<PB N="58" REF="60"> Phocians or the Thebans. It was con&s;i&s;tent with the
policy of this ambitious prince, who had little regard for religion, or the
intere&s;ts of Apollo, but was always intent upon his own, not to engage in a
war by which he could not reap the lea&s;t benefit; and to take advantage of a
juncture in which all Greece, employed and divided by a great war, gave him an
oppor|tunity to extend his frontiers, and pu&s;h his con|que&s;ts, without any
apprehen&s;ion of oppo&s;ition. He was al&s;o well plea&s;ed to &s;ee both
parties weaken and con&s;ume each other; as he &s;hould thereby be enabled to
fall upon them afterwards to greater advantage.</P>
<P>Being de&s;irous of &s;ubjecting Thrace, and of &s;e|curing the
conque&s;ts he had already made there, he determined to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf
of Methone, a &s;mall city, incapable of &s;upporting it&s;elf by its own
&s;trength, but which gave him di&s;quiet, and ob&s;tructed his de&s;igns,
whenever it was in the hands of his enemies. Accordingly he be|&s;ieged that
city, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of, and razed it. He lo&s;t one of his eyes
before Methone, by a very &s;ingular accident. A&s;ter of Amphipolis had
offered his &s;ervices to Philip, as &s;o excellent a mark&s;man, that he could
bring down birds in their mo&s;t rapid &s;light. The monarch made this
an&s;wer, 
<Q REND="inline">"Well, I will take <PB N="59" REF="61"> you into my
&s;ervice, when I make war upon &s;tarlings;"</Q> which an&s;wer &s;tung the
archer to the quick. A repartee proves often of fatal con&s;equence to him who
makes it; &s;o that, A&s;ter having thrown him&s;elf into the city, he let fly
an arrow, on which was written, 
<Q REND="inline">"To Philip's right eye."</Q> This carried a mo&s;t
cruel proof that he was a good mark&s;man; for he hit him in the right eye; and
Philip &s;ent him back the &s;ame arrow, with this in&s;cription: 
<Q REND="inline">"If Philip takes the city, he will hang up
A&s;ter;"</Q> and accordingly he was as good as his word. A &s;kilful &s;urgeon
drew the arrow out of Philip's eye with &s;o much art and dexterity, that not
the lea&s;t &s;car remained; and though he could not &s;ave his eye, he yet
took away the blemi&s;h.</P>
<P>After taking the city, Philip, ever &s;tudious either to weaken his
enemies by new conque&s;ts, or gain more friends by doing them &s;ome
im|portant &s;ervice, marched into The&s;&s;aly, which had implored his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t its tyrants. The liberty of that country &s;eemed
now &s;ecure, &s;ince Alexander of Pherae was no more. Never|thele&s;s, his
brothers, who, in concert with his wife Thebe, had murdered him, grown weary of
having &s;ome time acted the part of deliverers, revived his tyranny, and
oppre&s;&s;ed the The&s;&s;a|lians <PB N="60" REF="62"> with a new yoke.
Lycophron, the elde&s;t of the three brothers who &s;ucceeded Alexander, had
&s;trengthened him&s;elf by the protection of the Phocians Oenomarchus, their
leader, brought him a numerous body of forces, and at fir&s;t gained a
con&s;iderable advantage over Philip; but engaging him a &s;econd time, he was
en|tirely defeated, and his army routed. The flying troops were pur&s;ued to
the &s;ea-&s;hore; upwards of &s;ix thou&s;and men were killed on the &s;pot,
among whom was Oenomarchus, who&s;e body was hung upon a gallows; and three
thou&s;and, who were taken pri&s;oners, were thrown into the &s;ea by Philip's
order, as &s;o many &s;acrilegious wretches, the profe&s;&s;ed enemies of
religion.</P>
<P>Philip, after having freed the The&s;&s;alians, re&s;olved to carry
his arms into Phocis. This was his fir&s;t attempt to get footing in Greece,
and to have a &s;hare in the general affairs of the Greeks, from which the
kings of Macedon had always been excluded as foreigners. In this view, upon
pretence of going over into Phocis, in order to puni&s;h the &s;acrilegious
Phocians, he marched towards Thermopylae, to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of a
pa&s;s which gave him a free pa&s;&s;age into Greece, and e&s;pecially into
Attica.</P>
<P>An admi&s;&s;ion of foreigners into Greece, was a mea&s;ure that was
always formidable to tho&s;e <PB N="61" REF="63"> who called them&s;elves
Grecians. The Athenians, upon hearing of a march which might prove of the
utmo&s;t con&s;equence, ha&s;ted to Thermo|pylae, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
them&s;elves of this important pa&s;s, which Philip did not care attempting to
force. The Athenians were rou&s;ed from their lethargy of plea&s;ure, to make
u&s;e of this pre|caution, by the per&s;ua&s;ions of Demo&s;thenes, the
celebrated orator, who, from the beginning, &s;aw the ambition of Philip, and
the power of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to carry him through his
de&s;igns.</P>
<P>This illu&s;trious orator and &s;tate&s;man, whom we &s;hall
hereafter find acting &s;o con&s;iderable a part in the cour&s;e of this
hi&s;tory, was born in the la&s;t year of the ninety-ninth Olympiad, ac|cording
to Diony&s;ius, who, in his epi&s;tle to Lammacus, hath accurately
di&s;tingui&s;hed the different periods of his life, and the times in which his
&s;everal orations were delivered. He was the &s;on not of a mean and ob&s;cure
me|chanic, as the Roman &s;atyri&s;t hath repre&s;ented him, but of an eminent
Athenian citizen, who rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable fortune by the manufac|ture of
arms. At the age of &s;even years, he lo&s;t his father; and to add to this
misfortune, the guardians to whom he was intru&s;ted, wa&s;ted and embezzled a
con&s;iderable part of his inhe|ritance. <PB N="62" REF="64"> Thus
oppre&s;&s;ed by fraud, and di&s;|couraged by a weak and effeminate habit of
body, he yet di&s;covered an early ambition to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf as a
popular &s;peaker. The applau&s;e be&s;towed on a public orator, who had
defended his country's right to the city of Oropus, in an elaborate harangue,
inflamed his youthful mind with an eager de&s;ire of meriting the like honour.
I&s;ocrates and I&s;aeus were then the two mo&s;t eminent profe&s;&s;ors of
eloquence at Athens. The &s;oft and florid manner of the former did by no means
&s;uit the genius of De|mo&s;thenes: I&s;aeus was more vigorous and ener|getic,
and his &s;tyle better &s;uited to public bu|&s;ine&s;s. To him therefore he
applied, and under his direction pur&s;ued tho&s;e &s;tudies, which might
accompli&s;h him for the character to which he a&s;pired. His fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay
was made again&s;t his guardian, by whom he had been &s;o injuriou&s;ly
treated: but the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e was here of more &s;ervice than the
abilities of the young orator; for his early attempts were unpro|mi&s;ing, and
&s;oon convinced him of the nece&s;&s;ity of a graceful and manly
pronunciation. His clo&s;e and &s;evere application, and the extraor|dinary
diligence with which he laboured to con|quer his defects and natural
infirmities, are too well known, and have been too frequently the 
<PB N="63" REF="65"> &s;ubjects of hi&s;torians and critics, ancient and
modern, to need a minute recital. His cha|racter as a &s;tate&s;man will be
be&s;t collected from the hi&s;tory of his conduct in the pre&s;ent
tran|&s;actions. As an orator, the reader perhaps is not to be informed of his
qualifications. Indeed, the &s;tudy of oratory was at that time the readie&s;t
and almo&s;t the only means of ri&s;ing in the &s;tate. His fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay
at the bar was two years after this incident, when he called his guardians to
ac|count for embezzling his patrimony, and reco|vered &s;ome part of it. This
encouraged him &s;ome time after, to harangue before the people in their public
a&s;&s;embly; but he acquitted him&s;elf &s;o ill, that they hi&s;&s;ed him:
however, he ven|tured a &s;econd time, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s than
before, &s;o that he went away a&s;hamed, confounded, and quite in de&s;pair.
It was upon this occa&s;ion that Satyrus the player acco&s;ted him, and in a
friendly way encouraged him to proceed. With this view he a&s;ked him to
re|peat to him &s;ome ver&s;es of Sophocles, or Eu|ripedes, which he
accordingly did: the other repeated them after him, but with &s;uch a
dif|ferent &s;pirit and cadence, as made him &s;en&s;ible that he knew very
little of elocution. But by his in&s;tructions, and his own per&s;everance, he 
<PB N="64" REF="66"> at length made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it; and by the
methods before mentioned, corrected the im|perfections which were born with
him, as well as the ill habits which he had contracted. It is not very clear
whether this pa&s;&s;age be rightly a&s;cribed to Satyrus, who &s;eems to be
confounded with Neoptolemus and Andronicus, who were likewi&s;e famous
comedians; and Demo&s;thenes is &s;aid to have been in&s;tructed by all the
three.</P>
<P>With the&s;e advantages and improvements, he appeared again in
public, and &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that people flocked from all parts of Greece
to hear him. From thence he was looked upon as the &s;tandard of true
eloquence; in&s;o|much that none of his countrymen have been put in
compari&s;on with him; nor even among the Romans, any but Cicero. And though it
has been made a que&s;tion by the ancient writers, to which of the two they
&s;hould give the pre|&s;erence, they have not ventured to decide it, but have
contented them&s;elves with de&s;cribing their different beauties, and
&s;hewing, that they were both perfect in their kind. His eloquence was grave
and au&s;tere, like his temper; ma&s;|culine and &s;ublime, bold, forcible and
impe|tuous; abounding with metaphors, apo&s;trophes and interrogations; which,
with his &s;olemn <PB N="65" REF="67"> way of invoking and appealing to the
gods, the planets, the elements, and the manes of tho&s;e who fell at Salamis
and Marathon, had &s;uch a wonderful effect upon his hearers, that they thought
him in&s;pired. If he had not &s;o much &s;oftne&s;s and in&s;inuation as is
often requi&s;ite in an orator, it was not that he wanted art and de|licacy,
when the ca&s;e required it: he knew how to &s;ound the inclinations of the
people, and to lead them to the point he aimed at; and &s;ome|times, by
&s;eeming to propo&s;e that which was directly the contrary. But his chief
character|i&s;tic was vehemence, both in action and ex|pre&s;&s;ion; and indeed
that was the qualification of all others mo&s;t wanted at this time: for the
people were grown &s;o in&s;olent and imperious, &s;o factious and divided,
&s;o jealous of the power of the democracy, and withal &s;o &s;unk into a
&s;tate of plea&s;ure and indolence, that no arts of per&s;ua&s;ion would have
been &s;o effectual, as that &s;pirit and re&s;olution, that force and energy
of Demo&s;thenes, to humble them, to unite them, and to rou&s;e them into a
&s;en&s;e of their common danger.</P>
<P>But neither could Demo&s;thenes him&s;elf have made &s;uch
impre&s;&s;ions on them, if his talent of &s;peaking had not been &s;upported
by their opi|nion of his integrity. It was that which added <PB N="66" REF="68"> weight and empha&s;is to every thing he &s;aid, and animated the
whole. It was that which chiefly engaged their attention, and determined their
coun&s;els; when they were convinced that he &s;poke from his heart, and had no
intere&s;t to manage, but that of the community: and this he gave the
&s;tronge&s;t proofs of, in his zeal again&s;t Philip, who &s;aid, He was of
more weight again&s;t him than all the fleets and armies of the Athenians; and
that he had no enemy but Demo&s;thenes. He was not wanting in his en|deavours
to corrupt him, as he had mo&s;t of the leading men in Greece: but this great
orator with&s;tood all his offers; and, as it was ob&s;erved, all the gold in
Macedon could not bribe him.</P>
<P>When Philip found him&s;elf &s;hut out of Greece by the Athenians,
he turned his arms again&s;t tho&s;e remote places which depended on them,
either as colonies, or as conque&s;ts; and particularly again&s;t the
Olynthians, whom he had long looked upon with an evil eye; but had courted and
cajoled them, whil&s;t he was otherwi&s;e employed. But he came now re|&s;olved
entirely to reduce them; and advancing towards the city, only &s;ent them a
&s;hort me&s;&s;age, to let them know, that one of the&s;e two points was
become nece&s;&s;ary; either that they mu&s;t quit Olynthus, or he Macedonia.
Whereupon <PB N="67" REF="69"> they &s;ent immediately to Athens for relief.
The &s;ubject was debated there with great &s;olemnity, and Demo&s;thenes was
very earne&s;t in &s;ending them &s;uccours: he was oppo&s;ed by Demades and
Hyperides. The opinion, however, of Demo&s;thenes prevailed; the people of
Athens re&s;olved to unite again&s;t Philip, but the great difficulty lay in
furni&s;hing the &s;upplies: their principal fund, which had formerly &s;erved
the purpo&s;es of war, had long been converted to the u&s;e of the &s;tage. The
money ari&s;ing from this fund was computed at a thou&s;and talents a-year; and
a certain proportion of it was al|lotted to the citizens, to defray the charge
of their admittance into the theatre. This di&s;tri|bution having been
continued to them from the time of Pericles, they claimed it now as their
right, e&s;pecially &s;ince they had lately obtained a law, which made it
capital to propo&s;e the re|&s;toring the fund to the u&s;es for which it was
originally granted. Hence it was that, upon any pre&s;&s;ing emergency,
extraordinary taxes were to be rai&s;ed; and they were laid &s;o unequally, and
collected with &s;o much difficulty, that they &s;el|dom an&s;wered the
&s;ervice for which they were intended.</P>
<P>Demo&s;thenes treated this &s;ubject with the ut|mo&s;t art and
circum&s;pection. After &s;hewing that <PB N="68" REF="70"> the Athenians were
indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to rai&s;e an army, in order to &s;top the
enterprizes of their a&s;piring enemy, he a&s;&s;erted, that the theatrical
fund was the only probable means of &s;upply. The&s;e remon&s;trances had
&s;ome weight, but were not attended with de&s;erved &s;ucce&s;s. The Athenians
&s;ent a reinforcement to Olyn|thus; but Philip, who had corrupted the
prin|cipal men in the town, entered, plundered it, and &s;old the inhabitants
among the re&s;t of the &s;poil. Here he found much trea&s;ure, which &s;erved
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his further encroach|ments.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Thebans, being unable alone to terminate the
war, which they had &s;o long carried on again&s;t the Phocians, addre&s;&s;ed
Philip. Hitherto, as we before mentioned, he had ob&s;erved a kind of
neutrality with re&s;pect to the Sacred War; and he &s;eemed to wait for an
opportunity of declaring him&s;elf; that is, till both parties &s;hould have
weakened them&s;elves by a long war, which equally exhau&s;ted both. The
Thebans had now very much abated of that haughtine&s;s, and tho&s;e ambitious
views, with which the victories of Epaminondas had in&s;pired them. The
in&s;tant, therefore, they reque&s;ted the alliance of Philip, he re&s;olved to
e&s;pou&s;e the intere&s;t of that republic, in oppo|&s;ition 
<PB N="69" REF="71"> to the Phocians. He had not lo&s;t &s;ight of the project
he had formed of obtaining an entrance into Greece, in order to make him&s;elf
ma&s;ter of it. To give &s;ucce&s;s to his de&s;ign, it was proper for him to
declare in favour of one of the two parties, which at that time divided all
Greece; that is, either for the Thebans, or the Athenians and Spartans. He was
not &s;o void of &s;en&s;e as to imagine, that the latter party would
a&s;&s;i&s;t his de&s;ign of carrying his arms into Greece. He therefore had no
more to do but to join the Thebans, who offered them&s;elves voluntarily to
him, and who &s;tood in need of Philip's power, to &s;upport them&s;elves in
their declining condition: he therefore declared at once in their favour. But
to give a &s;pecious colour to his arms, be&s;ides the gratitude he affected to
have at heart for Thebes, in which he had been educated, he al&s;o pretended to
make an honour of the zeal with which he was fired with regard to the violated
god, and was very glad to pa&s;s for a religious prince, who warmly
e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the god and of the temple of Delphos, in order to
conciliate, by that means, the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of the Greeks.</P>
<P>There was nothing Philip had more at heart than to po&s;&s;e&s;s
him&s;elf of Thermopylae, as it <PB N="70" REF="72"> opened him a pa&s;&s;age
into Greece; to appro|priate all the honour of the Sacred War to him|&s;elf, as
if he had been principal in that affair; and to pre&s;ide in the Pythian games.
He was therefore de&s;irous of aiding the Thebans, and by their means to
po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of Phocis. But then, in order to put this double
de&s;ign in exe|cution, it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to keep it &s;ecret from
the Athenians, who had actually declared war again&s;t Thebes; and who, for
many years, had been in alliance with the Phocians. His bu&s;ine&s;s,
therefore, was to make them change their mea&s;ures, by placing other objects
in their view; and, on this occa&s;ion, the politics of Philip &s;ucceeded to a
wonder.</P>
<P>The Athenians, who began to grow tired of a war, which was very
burthen&s;ome, and of little benefit to them, had commi&s;&s;ioned
Cte&s;i|phon, and Phrynon, to &s;ound the intentions of Philip, and in what
manner he &s;tood di&s;po&s;ed in regard to peace. The&s;e related, that Philip
did not appear aver&s;e to it; and that he even ex|pre&s;&s;ed a great
affection for the commonwealth. Upon this, the Athenians re&s;olved to &s;end a
&s;olemn emba&s;&s;y, to enquire more &s;trictly into the truth of things, and
to procure the la&s;t ex|planations, previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;o
important a negociation. Ae&s;chines and Demo&s;thenes were <PB N="71" REF="73"> among the ten amba&s;&s;adors, who brought back three from Philip;
<HI>viz.</HI> Antipater, Parmenio, and Eurylochus. All the ten executed their
commi&s;&s;ion very faithfully, and gave a very good account of it. Upon this,
they were im|mediately &s;ent back, with full powers to con|clude a peace, and
to ratify it by oaths. It was then Demo&s;thenes, who, in his fir&s;t
em|ba&s;&s;y, had met &s;ome Athenian captives in Ma|cedonia, and had
promi&s;ed to return and ran&s;om them at his own expence, endeavoured to
enable him&s;elf to keep his word; and, in the mean time, advi&s;ed his
colleagues to embark with the utmo&s;t expedition, as the republic had
com|manded; and to wait, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, upon Philip, in what place
&s;oever he might be. How|ever, the&s;e, in&s;tead of making a &s;peedy
di&s;|patch, as they were de&s;ired, went like amba&s;&s;a|dors, proceeded to
Macedonia by land, &s;taid three months in that country, and gave Philip time
to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of &s;everal other &s;trong places belonging to the
Athenians in Thrace. At la&s;t, meeting with the king of Macedonia, they agreed
with him upon articles of peace; but he, having lulled them a&s;leep with the
&s;pecious pre|tence of a treaty, deferred the ratification of it from day to
day. In the mean time he found means to corrupt the amba&s;&s;adors, one after
another, <PB N="72" REF="74"> by pre&s;ents, Demo&s;thenes excepted; who being
but one, oppo&s;ed his colleagues to no manner of purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Philip being &s;uffered quietly to pur&s;ue his march into Phocis,
gained the &s;treights of Thermopylae, but did not immediately di&s;cover what
u&s;e he intended to make of his entrance into Greece; but went on, according
to his agreement with the Thebans, to put an end to the Phocian war, which he
ea&s;ily effected. His name and appearance &s;truck &s;uch a terror among the
Phocians, that though they had lately re|ceived a reinforcement of a thou&s;and
heavy armed Spartans, under the command of their king Archidamus, they declined
giving him battle, and &s;ent to treat with him, or rather to &s;ubmit
them&s;elves to any terms that he would give them. He allowed Phalicus to
retire, with eight thou&s;and men, being mercenaries, into Pelopone&s;us; but
the re&s;t, who were the in|habitants of Phocis, were left at his mercy. As the
di&s;po&s;ing of them was a matter wherein Greece in general was concerned, he
did not think fit to act in it by his own private autho|rity, but referred it
to the Amphyctions, whom he cau&s;ed to be a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e.
But they were &s;o much under his influence, that they &s;erved only to give a
&s;anction to his deter|minations. <PB N="73" REF="75"> They decreed, that all
the cities of Phocis &s;hould be demoli&s;hed; that they who had fled, as being
principally concerned in the &s;a|crilege, &s;hould be &s;tigmatized as
accur&s;ed, and pro&s;cribed as outlaws; that they who remained as inhabitants,
&s;hould be di&s;per&s;ed in villages, and obliged to pay out of their lands a
yearly tribute of &s;ixty talents, until the whole of what had been taken out
of the temple &s;hould be re|&s;tored: they were likewi&s;e adjudged to lo&s;e
their &s;eat in the council of the Amphyctions, wherein they had a double
voice. This Philip got transferred to him&s;elf, which was a very material
point, and may be looked upon as the principal &s;tep towards his gaining that
authority which he afterwards exerci&s;ed in the affairs of Greece. At the
&s;ame time he gained, in conjunction with the Thebans and The&s;&s;alians, the
&s;uper|intendency of the Pythian games, which the Corinthians had forfeited,
for their having taken part with the Phocians.</P>
<P>Philip having, by the&s;e plau&s;ible methods, &s;ucceeded in this
expedition, did not think it advi&s;eable, by attempting any thing further at
pre&s;ent, to &s;ully the glory he had acquired by it, or to incen&s;e the body
of the Grecians again&s;t him; wherefore he returned, in a tri|umphant manner,
to his own dominions. After <PB N="74" REF="76"> &s;ettling his conque&s;ts at
home, he marched into The&s;&s;aly; and having extirpated the remains of
tyranny in the &s;everal cities there, he not only confirmed the
The&s;&s;alians in his intere&s;t, but gained over many of their
neighbours.</P>
<P>It was upon this occa&s;ion that Philip is re|marked for an act of
private ju&s;tice, which far outweighs his public celebrity. A certain
&s;oldier, in the Macedonian army, had, in many in|&s;tances, di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf by extraordinary acts of valour, and had received many marks of
Philip's favour and approbation. On &s;ome occa&s;ion he embarked on board a
ve&s;&s;el, which was wrecked by a violent &s;torm, and he him&s;elf ca&s;t on
the &s;hore helple&s;s and naked, and &s;carcely with the appearance of life. A
Macedonian, who&s;e lands were contiguous to the &s;ea, came opportunely to be
witne&s;s of his di&s;tre&s;s; and, with all humane and charitable
tenderne&s;s, flew to the relief of the unhappy &s;tranger. He bore him to his
hou&s;e, laid him in his own bed, re|vived, cheri&s;hed, comforted, and for
forty days &s;upplied him freely with all the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies
which his langui&s;hing condition could require. The &s;oldier, thus happily
re&s;|cued from death, was ince&s;&s;ant in the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of
gratitude to his benefactor, a&s;&s;ured him, of his intere&s;t with the king,
and of his <PB N="75" REF="77"> power and re&s;olution of obtaining for him,
from the royal bounty, the noble returns which &s;uch extraordinary benevolence
had merited. He was now completely recovered, and his kind ho&s;t &s;upplied
him with money to pur&s;ue his journey. In &s;ome time after, he pre&s;ented
him&s;elf before the king; he recounted his mis|fortunes, magnified his
&s;ervices; and this in|human wretch, who had looked with an eye of envy on the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the man who had pre&s;erved his life, was now &s;o
abandoned to all &s;en&s;e of gratitude, as to reque&s;t the king would
be&s;tow upon him the hou&s;e and lands where he had been &s;o tenderly and
kindly entertained. Unhappily Philip, without examination, incon|&s;iderately
and precipitately granted his infa|mous reque&s;t; and this &s;oldier now
returned to his pre&s;erver, repaid his goodne&s;s by driving him from his
&s;ettlement, and taking immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the fruits of his
hone&s;t indu&s;try. The poor man, &s;tung with this in&s;tance of
un|paralleled ingratitude and in&s;en&s;ibility, boldly determined, in&s;tead
of &s;ubmitting to his wrongs, to &s;eek relief; and, in a letter addre&s;&s;ed
to Philip, repre&s;ented his own, and the &s;oldier's conduct, in a lively and
affecting manner. The king was in&s;tantly fired with indignation; he ordered
that ju&s;tice &s;hould be done without <PB N="76" REF="78"> delay; that the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;hould be imme|diately re&s;tored to the man who&s;e
charitable offices had been thus horridly repaid; and having &s;eized his
&s;oldier, cau&s;ed the&s;e words to be branded on his forehead&mdash;The
Ungrateful Gue&s;t;&mdash;a character infamous in every age, and among all
nations; but particularly among the Greeks, who, from the earlie&s;t times,
were mo&s;t &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;ervant of the laws of ho&s;|pitality.</P>
<P>Having &s;trengthened him&s;elf in the&s;e parts, he went the next
year into Thrace, where he had formed a de&s;ign again&s;t the Cher&s;one&s;e.
This penin&s;ula had, with &s;ome little inter|ruption, been for many years in
the hands of the Athenians; but Cotys, as being king of the country, had lately
wre&s;ted it from them, and left it in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his &s;on
Cher&s;obleptes. He not being able to defend him&s;elf again&s;t Philip, gave
it back to the Athenians, re&s;erving to him|&s;elf only Cardia, the capital
city. But Philip having &s;oon after &s;poiled him of the re&s;t of his
dominions, the Cardians, for fear of falling again under the power of the
Athenians, threw them|&s;elves into his protection. Diopithes, who was the
chief of the Athenian colony lately &s;ent to the Cher&s;one&s;e, con&s;idered
this proceeding of Philip, in &s;upporting the Cardians, as an act of 
<PB N="77" REF="79"> ho&s;tility again&s;t Athens; whereupon he invaded the
maritime parts of Thrace, and carried away a great deal of booty. Philip being
at this time in the upper part of the country, was not in a condition to do
him&s;elf ju&s;tice: but he wrote to complain of it at Athens, as an
in|fraction of the peace; and his creatures there were not wanting on their
part to aggravate the charge again&s;t Diopithes, as having acted with|out
orders, and taking it upon him&s;elf to renew the war: they likewi&s;e
accu&s;ed him of com|mitting acts of piracy, and of laying their allies under
contribution. But whatever grounds there were for this part of the
accu&s;ation, the go|vernment of Athens was principally to blame in it; for
having no proper fund for the wars, they &s;ent out their generals without
money or provi&s;ions, and left them to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and yet made
them an&s;werable for any mi&s;car|riages that &s;hould happen, for want of
their being better &s;upplied. This was a great di&s;|couragement to the
&s;ervice, and put tho&s;e who were employed in it upon pillaging and
plun|dering, in &s;uch a manner, as they would other|wi&s;e have been a&s;hamed
of. Demo&s;thenes, in an harangue that he made upon the &s;tage of the
Cher&s;one&s;e, undertook the defence of Diopithes.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80"> Philip, however, was no way intimidated at the
wordy re&s;i&s;tance of his eloquent antagoni&s;t; he went on with artful
indu&s;try, quelling tho&s;e by his power who were unable to re&s;i&s;t, and
tho&s;e by his pre&s;ents, whom he was unable to oppo&s;e. The divi&s;ions that
then &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in Pelopone&s;us, gave him a pretext for inter|meddling in
the affairs of the Greek confe|deracy. The&s;e divi&s;ions were chiefly owing
to the Spartans; who, having little to do in the late foreign tran&s;actions,
were recovering their &s;trength at home; and, according to their u&s;ual
practice, as they increa&s;ed in power, made u&s;e of it to in&s;ult and
oppre&s;s their neighbours. The Argives and Me&s;&s;enians being at this time
per&s;ecuted by them, put them&s;elves under the protection of Philip; and the
Thebans joining with them, they all together formed a powerful confederacy. The
natural balance again&s;t it, was an union between Athens and Sparta, which the
Spartans pre&s;&s;ed with great earne&s;tne&s;s, as the only means for their
common &s;ecurity; and Philip and the Thebans did all in their power to prevent
it. But Demo&s;thenes exerting him|&s;elf upon this occa&s;ion, rou&s;ed up the
Athe|nians, and put them &s;o far upon their guard, that, without coming to an
open rupture with Philip, they obliged him to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81"> Philip, however, did not continue idle upon
this di&s;appointment. Ever re&s;tle&s;s and enter|pri&s;ing, he turned his
views another way: he had long con&s;idered the i&s;land of Eubaea as pro|per,
from its &s;ituation, to favour the de&s;igns he meditated again&s;t Greece;
and, in the very be|ginning of his reign, had attempted to po&s;&s;e&s;s
him&s;elf of it. He indeed &s;et every engine to work at that time, in order to
&s;eize upon that i&s;land, which he called the &s;hackles of Greece. But it
nearly concerned the Athenians, on the other &s;ide, not to &s;uffer it to fall
into the hands of an enemy, e&s;pecially as it might be joined to the continent
of Attica, by a bridge: however, that people, according to their u&s;ual
cu&s;tom, continued indolent, whil&s;t Philip pur&s;ued his conque&s;ts. The
latter, who was continually at|tentive and vigilant, endeavoured to carry on an
intelligence in the i&s;land; and, by dint of pre&s;ents, bribed tho&s;e who
had the greate&s;t au|thority in it. At the reque&s;t of certain of the
inhabitants, he &s;ent &s;ome troops privately thi|ther, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf of &s;everal &s;trong places, di&s;mantled Porthmos, a very important
fortre&s;s in Eubaea, and e&s;tabli&s;hed three tyrants, or kings, over the
country.</P>
<P>The Athenians were conjured, in this di|&s;tre&s;&s;ing juncture, by
one Plutarch, who was at <PB N="80" REF="82"> that time upon the i&s;land, to
come and deliver the inhabitants from the yoke which Philip was going to
impo&s;e upon them. Upon this, they di&s;patched a few troops thither under the
com|mand of Phocion, a general of whom great expectations were formed, and
who&s;e conduct well de&s;erved the favourable opinion the public had of
him.</P>
<P>This man would have done honour to the early and lea&s;t corrupted
times of the Athenian &s;tate. His manners were formed in the aca|demy, upon
the models of the mo&s;t exact and rigid virtue. It was &s;aid, that no
Athenian ever &s;aw him laugh, or weep, or deviate in any in&s;tance from the
mo&s;t fettled gravity and compo&s;ure. He learned the art of war under
Chabrias, and frequently moderated the ex|ce&s;&s;es, and corrected the errors
of that general: his humanity he admired and imitated, and taught him to exert
it in a more exten&s;ive and liberal manner. When he had received his
di|rections to &s;ail, with twenty &s;hips, to collect the contributions of the
allies and dependent cities; 
<Q REND="inline">"Why that force?" &s;aid Phocion; "if I am to meet
them as enemies, it is in&s;uffi|cient; if I am &s;ent to friends and allies, a
&s;ingle ve&s;&s;el will &s;erve."</Q> He bore the &s;eve|rities of a military
life with &s;o much ea&s;e, that <PB N="81" REF="83"> if Phocion ever appeared
warmly cloathed, the &s;oldiers at once pronounced it the &s;ign of a
re|markably bad &s;ea&s;on. His outward appearance was forbidding, but his
conver&s;ation ea&s;y and obliging; and all his words and actions expre&s;&s;ed
the utmo&s;t affection and benevolence. In po|pular a&s;&s;emblies, his lively,
clo&s;e, and natural manner of &s;peaking, &s;eemed as it were the echo of the
&s;implicity and integrity of his mind, and had frequently a greater effect
than even the dignity and energy of Demo&s;thenes, who called him the pruner of
his periods. He &s;tudied only good &s;en&s;e and plain rea&s;oning, and
de&s;pi&s;ed every adventitious ornament. In an a&s;&s;embly, when he was to
addre&s;s the people, he was &s;ur|pri&s;ed by a friend, wrapped up in thought:

<Q REND="inline">"I am con&s;idering," &s;aid he, "whether I cannot
retrench &s;ome part of my intended addre&s;s."</Q> He was &s;en&s;ible of the
ill conduct of his country|men, and ever treated them with the greate&s;t
&s;everity. He defied their cen&s;ures; and &s;o far did he affect to
de&s;pi&s;e their applau&s;e, that at a time when his &s;entiments extorted
their appro|bation, he turned about in &s;urpri&s;e, and a&s;ked a friend, If
any thing weak or impertinent had e&s;caped him? His &s;en&s;e of the
degeneracy of Athens, made him fond of pacific mea&s;ures. <PB N="82" REF="84">
He &s;aw the de&s;igns of Philip, but imagined that the &s;tate was too
corrupted to give him any effectual oppo&s;ition; &s;o that he was of the
number of tho&s;e men who, according to De|mo&s;thenes in his third Phillipic
oration, gave up the intere&s;ts of the &s;tate, not corruptly or ignorantly,
but from a de&s;perate purpo&s;e of yielding to the fate of a con&s;titution,
thought to be irrecoverably lo&s;t. He was of con&s;equence ever of the party
oppo&s;ite to Demo&s;thenes; and having been taught, by experience, to
&s;u&s;pect the popular leaders, con&s;idered his earne&s;tne&s;s to rou&s;e
the Athenians to arms, as an artifice to embroil the &s;tate, and by that means
to gain an influence in the a&s;&s;embly. 
<Q REND="inline">"Phocion," &s;aid Demo&s;thenes, "the people, in
&s;ome mad fit, will certainly &s;acrifice thee to their fury."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Yes," replied he, "and you will be their victim, if
ever they have an interval of rea&s;on."</Q> Yet they often pre|vailed on him
to act again&s;t his judgment, though never to &s;peak again&s;t his
con&s;cience. He never refu&s;ed or declined the command, whatever might be his
opinion of the expe|dition. Forty five times was he cho&s;en to lead their
armies; generally in his ab&s;ence, and ever without the lea&s;t application.
They knew his <PB N="83" REF="85"> merit; and, in the hour of danger, forgot
that &s;everity with which he u&s;ually treated their in|clinations and
opinions.</P>
<P>It was to him the Athenians gave the com|mand of the forces they
&s;ent to the aid of Plutarch of Eretria. But this traitor repaid his
benefactors with ingratitude; he &s;et up the &s;tan|dard again&s;t them, and
endeavoured openly to repul&s;e the very army he had reque&s;ted. How|ever,
Phocion was not at a lo&s;s how to act upon this unfore&s;een perfidy; for he
pur&s;ued his en|terpri&s;e, won a battle, and drove Plutarch from Eretria.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;appointments, however, no way in|timidated Philip, or
rendered him the lea&s;t remi&s;s in pro&s;ecuting his original de&s;ign. He
now, therefore, changed the method of his attack, and &s;ought for an
opportunity of di|&s;tre&s;&s;ing Athens another way. He knew that this city,
from the barrenne&s;s of Attica, &s;tood in greater want of foreign corn than
any other. To di&s;po&s;e, at di&s;cretion, of their tran&s;ports, and by that
means &s;tarve the Athenians, he marched towards Thrace, from whence that city
imported the greate&s;t part of its provi&s;ions, with an intention to
be&s;iege Perinthus and Byzantium. To keep his kingdom in obedience 
<PB N="84" REF="86"> during his ab&s;ence, he left his &s;on Alexander be|hind,
with &s;overeign authority, though he was fifteen years old. This young prince
gave, even at that time, &s;ome proofs of his courage; having defeated certain
neighbouring &s;tates, &s;ubject to Macedonia, who had con&s;idered the king's
ab&s;ence as a very proper time for exe|cuting the de&s;ign they had formed of
revolting. This happy &s;ucce&s;s of Alexander's fir&s;t expe|ditions, was
highly agreeable to his father, and at the &s;ame time an earne&s;t of what
might be expected from him. But fearing le&s;t, allured by this dangerous bait,
he &s;hould abandon him&s;elf incon&s;iderately to his vivacity and fire, he
&s;ent for him in order to become his ma&s;ter; and form him, in per&s;on, for
the trade of war.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Philip opened the cam|paign with the &s;iege of
Perinthus, a con&s;ider|able city of Thrace, and firmly attached to the
Athenians. It was a&s;&s;i&s;ted from Byzantium, a neighbouring city, which
threw in &s;uccours as occa&s;ion required. Philip, therefore, re&s;olved to
be&s;iege both at the &s;ame time. Still, how|ever, he was de&s;irous to appear
cautious and tender of di&s;plea&s;ing the Athenians, whom he endeavoured to
amu&s;e with the mo&s;t profound <PB N="85" REF="87"> re&s;pect, mixed with
well-timed abu&s;es, and the mo&s;t flattering &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Upon this
oc|ca&s;ion, he wrote them a letter, reproaching them, in the &s;tronge&s;t
terms, for their infraction of treaties, and his own religious ob&s;ervance of
them. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the times of great enmity," &s;ays he, "the
mo&s;t you did was to fit out &s;hips of war again&s;t me, and to &s;eize and
&s;ell the merchants that came to trade in my domi|nions; but now you carry
your hatred and inju&s;tice to &s;uch prodigious lengths, as even to &s;end
amba&s;&s;adors to the king of Per&s;ia, to make him declare again&s;t
me."</Q></P>
<P>This letter gave the orators who undertook Philip's defence, a fine
opportunity of ju&s;tifying him to the people. Demo&s;thenes alone &s;tood
firm, and &s;till continued to expo&s;e his artful de&s;igns, and to break down
all tho&s;e laboured &s;chemes which were undertaken to deceive the people.
Sen&s;ible, on this occa&s;ion, how ne|ce&s;&s;ary it was to remove the fir&s;t
impre&s;&s;ions which the peru&s;al of this letter might make, he immediately
a&s;cended the tribunal, and from thence harangued the people, with all the
thunder of his eloquence. He told them, the letter was written in a &s;tyle not
&s;uitable to the people of Athens; that it was a plain decla|ration 
<PB N="86" REF="88"> of war again&s;t them; that Philip had long &s;ince made
the &s;ame declaration by his actions; and that, by the peace he had concluded
with them, he meant nothing further than a bare ce&s;&s;ation of arms, in order
to gain time, and to take them more unprepared. From thence he proceeded to his
u&s;ual topic of reproving them for their &s;loth, for &s;uffering them&s;elves
to be deluded by their orators who were in Philip's pay. 
<Q REND="inline">"Convinced by the&s;e truths," continued he, "O
Athenians! and &s;trongly per&s;uaded that we can no longer be allowed to
affirm that we enjoy peace, (for Philip has now de|clared war again&s;t us by
his letter, and has long done the &s;ame by his conduct) you ought not to
&s;pare either the public trea&s;ure, or the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of private
per&s;ons, but when occa&s;ion &s;hall require, ha&s;te to your re&s;pective
&s;tandards, and &s;et abler generals at your head, than tho&s;e you have
hitherto employed; for no one among you ought to imagine, that the &s;ame men
who have ruined your affairs, will have abilities to re&s;tore them to their
former happy &s;ituation. Think how infamous it is, that a man from Macedon
&s;hould con|temn dangers to &s;uch a degree, that merely to aggrandi&s;e his
empire, he &s;hould ru&s;h into <PB N="87" REF="89"> the mid&s;t of combats,
and return from battle covered with wounds; and that the Athenians, who&s;e
hereditary right it is to obey no man, but to impo&s;e law on others, &s;word
in hand; that Athenians, I &s;ay, merely through dejection of &s;pirit and
indolence, &s;hould degenerate from the glory of their ance&s;tors, and
aban|don the intere&s;t of their country!"</Q> To this expo&s;tulation, Phocion
readily offered his voice and opinion. He urged the incapacity of the generals
already cho&s;en; and, in con&s;equence of his advice, he him&s;elf was
appointed general of the army that was to go again&s;t Philip, who was &s;till
be&s;ieging Byzantium.</P>
<P>Phocion having led his troops to the &s;uccour of the Byzantians,
the inhabitants, on his ar|rival, opened their gates to him with joy, and
lodged his &s;oldiers in their hou&s;es, as their own brothers and children.
The Athenian officers and &s;oldiers, &s;truck with the confidence repo&s;ed in
them, behaved with the utmo&s;t prudence and mode&s;ty, and were entirely
irreproachable in their conduct; nor were they le&s;s admired for their
courage; and in all the attacks they &s;u&s;tained, di&s;covered the utmo&s;t
intrepidity, which danger &s;eemed only to improve. Pho|cion's prudence,
&s;econded by the bravery of his <PB N="88" REF="90"> troops, &s;oon forced
Philip to abandon his de|&s;ign upon Byzantium and Perinthus. He was beat out
of the Helle&s;pont, which dimini&s;hed very much his fame and glory; for he
hitherto had been thought invincible, and nothing had been able to oppo&s;e
him. Phocion took &s;ome of his &s;hips, recovered many fortre&s;&s;es which he
had garri&s;oned, and having made &s;everal de&s;cents into different parts of
his territories, he plun|dered all the open country, till a body of forces
a&s;&s;embling to check his progre&s;s, he was obliged to retire.</P>
<P>Philip, after having been forced to rai&s;e the &s;iege of
Byzantium, marched again&s;t Atheas king of Scythia; from whom he had received
&s;ome per&s;onal cau&s;e of di&s;content, and took his &s;on with him in this
expedition. Though the Scythians had a very numerous army, he defeated them
without any difficulty: he got a very great booty, which con&s;i&s;ted not in
gold or &s;ilver, the u&s;e and value of which the Scythians were not as yet
&s;o unhappy as to know, but in cattle, in hor&s;es, and a great number of
women and children.</P>
<P>At his return from Scythia, the Triballi, a people of Moe&s;ia,
di&s;puted the pa&s;s with him, laying claim to part of the plunder he was
car|rying <PB N="89" REF="91"> off. Philip was forced to come to a battle; and
a very bloody one was fought, in which great numbers on each &s;ide were killed
on the &s;pot: the king him&s;elf was wounded in the thigh, and, with the
&s;ame thru&s;t, had his hor&s;e killed under him. Alexander flew to his
father's aid, and covering him with his &s;hield, killed, or put to flight all
who attacked him.</P>
<P>The Athenians had con&s;idered the &s;iege of Byzantium as an
ab&s;olute rupture, and an open declaration of war. The king of Macedon, who
was apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences of it, and dreaded very much the power
of the Athenians, who&s;e hatred he had drawn upon him&s;elf, made overtures of
peace, in order to &s;often their re|&s;entment. Phocion, little
&s;u&s;picious, and ap|prehen&s;ive of the uncertainty of military wants, was
of opinion, that the Athenians &s;hould accept his offers: but Demo&s;thenes,
who had &s;tudied more than Phocion the genius and character of Philip, and was
per&s;uaded that, according to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, his only view was to
impo&s;e upon the Athenians, prevented their li&s;tening to his pacific
propo&s;als. When Philip found the Athenians would not treat with him, and that
they were acting offen&s;ively again&s;t him, e&s;|pecially at &s;ea, where
they blocked up his <PB N="90" REF="92"> ports, and put an entire &s;top to his
commerce, he began to form new alliances again&s;t them, particularly with the
Thebans and The&s;&s;alians, without whom he knew he could not keep open his
pa&s;&s;age into Greece. At the &s;ame time he was &s;en&s;ible, that his
engaging the&s;e powers to act directly again&s;t Athens, and in his own
per|&s;onal quarrel, would have &s;o bad an a&s;pect, that they would not
ea&s;ily come into it. For which rea&s;on he endeavoured, underhand, to create
new di&s;turbances in Greece, that he might take &s;uch a part in them, as
would be&s;t an&s;wer his views: and when the flame was kindled, his point was
to appear rather to be called in as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, than to act as a
principal.</P>
<P>By the re&s;ult of his machinations, he &s;oon found an opportunity
of rai&s;ing divi&s;ions be|tween the Locrians of Amphi&s;&s;a, and their
ca|pital city. They were accu&s;ed of having pro|faned a &s;pot of &s;acred
ground, (which lay very near the temple of Delphos), by ploughing it, as the
Phocians had done upon a former occa|&s;ion. In order to produce and widen this
breach, Philip employed Ae&s;chines the orator, who by bribes was entirely
devoted to him, to harangue at the a&s;&s;embly of the Amphyctions again&s;t
this outrage upon the religion of their <PB N="91" REF="93"> country.
Ae&s;chines was a man of great abilities, and only &s;econd in eloquence to
Demo&s;thenes. He had now a fair opportunity of rai&s;ing com|motions, by
appearing only intere&s;ted for his country, and zealous for the glory and
defence of Athens. With a pa&s;&s;ionate warmth, which is frequently the effect
of artifice as well as of real patrioti&s;m, and which is mo&s;t likely to
de|ceive, and more particularly in popular a&s;&s;em|blies, by being
con&s;idered as the indication of &s;incerity, and the overflowings of a heart
ho|ne&s;tly affected, he boldly delivered his opi|nions. His &s;entiments were
echoed through the a&s;&s;embly by the friends of Philip; the tu|mult was kept
up to drown all remon&s;trances of caution and policy, and a re&s;olution was
pa&s;&s;ed, that a deputation &s;hould be &s;ent to Philip king of Macedon,
inviting him to a&s;&s;i&s;t Apollo and the Amphyctions, and to repel the
outrages of the impious Amphi&s;&s;oeans; and far|ther to declare, that he was
con&s;tituted, by all the Greeks, member of the council of Amphyctions, and
general and commander of their forces, with full and unlimited powers.</P>
<P>This welcome invitation and commi&s;&s;ion, the fruit of all his
&s;ecret practices, Philip received in Thrace, while he was yet on his return
to <PB N="92" REF="94"> Macedon. He bowed with an affectionate re|verence to
the venerable council, and declared his readine&s;s to execute their
orders.</P>
<P>The inferior &s;tates of Greece, and all tho&s;e who&s;e
&s;implicity and weakne&s;s rendered them in&s;en&s;ible to the de&s;igns now
forming by Philip, entirely approved of the act of the Amphyctions; and of the
nomination of a prince to the com|mand of their forces, &s;o eminent and
illu&s;trious for his piety, and &s;o capable of executing the vengeance of
Heaven. At Sparta and at Athens, this event was con&s;idered in a different
manner. The fir&s;t of the&s;e people, though po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed but of a
&s;mall part of their ancient great|ne&s;s, yet &s;till retained their pride,
and &s;eemed to have looked with a &s;ullen indignation at the ho|nours paid to
Macedon: the Athenians had been long taught to dread the policy of Philip, and
now their great popular leader repeatedly urged the nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;u&s;picion, and repre&s;ented all the late tran&s;actions in the
Amphyctionic council as the effects of Philip's intrigues, and a de&s;ign
again&s;t Greece in general, but more particularly again&s;t the welfare and
liberty of Athens.</P>
<P>To counteract the zeal of Demo&s;thenes, and to prevent the effects
of his ince&s;&s;ant remon|&s;trances, <PB N="93" REF="95"> the minds of the
people were alarmed with oracles and predictions, uttered with all &s;olemnity
from the &s;acred tripod, and reported to the Athenians with all the veneration
due to the dictates of Apollo. Vengeance was pro|nounced again&s;t all tho&s;e
who &s;hould pre&s;ume to oppo&s;e the king of Macedon, the de&s;tined
in|&s;trument of Divine Ju&s;tice; and the people were exhorted not to &s;uffer
artful and de&s;igning ora|tors, and popular leaders, to &s;educe them to their
ruin.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Philip immediately got his troops together, and,
with all the &s;how of re|ligious veneration, began to march, in order to
cha&s;ti&s;e the irreverent Locrians: but he had far different aims; and
in&s;tead of proceeding upon &s;o ridiculous a commi&s;&s;ion, made a &s;udden
turn, and &s;eized upon Elatea, a capital city of Phocis, which was very well
&s;ituated for awing the Thebans, of whom he began to grow jea|lous, and for
preparing his way to Athens. But by &s;o extraordinary a &s;tep as this, he
fairly threw off the ma&s;k, and bade defiance to the whole body of Grecians.
Thus was this enter|pri&s;ing prince, all of a &s;udden, ma&s;ter of a port of
the utmo&s;t con&s;equence; at the head of an army, capable of &s;triking
terror into his op|po&s;ers; at the di&s;tance of but two days march 
<PB N="94" REF="96"> from Attica; ab&s;olute commander, as it were, of the
citadel and fortre&s;s, both of Thebes and Athens; conveniently &s;ituated for
receiving &s;uccours from The&s;&s;aly and Macedon; and en|tirely at liberty
either to give battle to tho&s;e who might pre&s;ume to appear in arms
again&s;t him, or to protract the war to any length that might be found
convenient.</P>
<P>The news of Philip's recent tran&s;action was quickly &s;pread
through the adjacent countries, and received with all the &s;tupid and
helple&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment of men rou&s;ed from a long le|thargy, and awakened
to a dreadful &s;en&s;e of their danger, and of the real de&s;igns of their
enemy. It was late in the evening when a cou|rier arriving at Athens, appeared
before the Prytanes, and pronounced the dreadful tidings, that the king of
Macedon had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Elatea. The&s;e magi&s;trates, and all
the other citizens, were now at &s;upper, indulging them|&s;elves in the
plea&s;ures and gaieties of the table, when the news, which in an in&s;tant
rung through all the city, rou&s;ed them from their &s;tate of ea&s;e, and put
an end to all their &s;e&s;tivity. The &s;treets and public places were
in&s;tantly filled with a di&s;tracted concour&s;e; every man with terror and
confu&s;ion in his countenance, and every man &s;olicitous for an immediate
con|&s;ultation, <PB N="95" REF="97"> on an emergency &s;o important and
alarming. At the dawn of the &s;ucceeding day, the a&s;&s;embly met together,
impre&s;&s;ed with that con&s;ternation which urgent danger naturally
in&s;pires. The whole body of the people flocked to the &s;enate-hou&s;e,
&s;eized their places, and waited with the utmo&s;t anxiety for &s;o important
a deliberation. The herald, as was the cu&s;tom at Athens, aro&s;e, and cried
out with a loud voice, 
<Q REND="inline">"Who among you will a&s;cend the tri|bunal?"</Q> All
however was &s;ilence, terror and di&s;may: he again repeated the invitation;
but &s;till no one ro&s;e up, though all the generals and orators were
pre&s;ent. At length Demo&s;thenes, animated with the greatne&s;s of the
approach|ing danger, aro&s;e, undaunted and unmoved in this &s;cene of horror.
With a countenance of &s;erenity, the firm compo&s;ure of a patriot, and the
&s;age di&s;cernment of a complete &s;tate&s;|man, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
to the a&s;&s;embly, in the following manner:&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"Athenians! permit me to explain the circum&s;tances
of that &s;tate which Philip has now &s;eized upon. Tho&s;e of its citizens
whom his gold could corrupt, or his artifice deceive, are all at his devotion.
What then is his de&s;ign? By drawing up his forces, and di&s;playing his
powers on the bor|ders of Thebes, he hopes to in&s;pire his ad|herents 
<PB N="96" REF="98"> with confidence and elevation, and to terrify and controul
his adver&s;aries, that fear or force may drive them into tho&s;e mea&s;ures
which they have hitherto oppo&s;ed. If then we are re&s;olved, in this
conjuncture, to cheri&s;h the remembrance of every act of unkindne&s;s, which
the Thebans have done to Athens; if we regard them with &s;u&s;picion, as men
who have ranged them&s;elves on the &s;ide of our enemy; in the fir&s;t place,
we &s;hall act agree|ably to Philip's warme&s;t wi&s;hes; and then I am
apprehen&s;ive, that the party, who now oppo&s;e him, may be brought over to
his in|tere&s;t; the whole city &s;ubmit unanimou&s;ly to his direction; and
Thebes and Macedon fall, with their united force, on Attica. Grant the due
attention to what I &s;hall now propo&s;e; let it be calmly weighed, without
di&s;pute or cavil, and I doubt not but that my coun&s;els may direct you to
the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;alutary mea&s;ures, and di&s;pel the dangers now
im|pending over the &s;tate. What then do I re|commend?&mdash;Fir&s;t, &s;hake
off that terror which hath po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed your minds; and, in&s;tead of
fearing for your&s;elves, let the Thebans be the objects of your
apprehen&s;ions: they are more immediately affected; they are the fir&s;t to
feel the dangers. In the next place, all tho&s;e of <PB N="97" REF="99"> the
age for military &s;ervice, both infantry and cavalry, &s;hould march
in&s;tantly to Eleu&s;is, that Greece may &s;ee, that you are al&s;o
a&s;|&s;embled in arms; and your friends in Thebes be emboldened to a&s;&s;ert
their rights, when they are a&s;&s;ured, that as they who have &s;old their
country to the Macedonians, have a force at Elatea to &s;upport them, &s;o you
are ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the men who bravely contend for liberty. In the
la&s;t place, I recommend to you to nominate ten amba&s;&s;adors, who, with the
generals, may have full authority to determine the time, and all other
circum|&s;tances of this march. When the&s;e amba&s;&s;a|dors arrive at Thebes,
how are they to con|duct this great affair? This is a point worthy of your
mo&s;t &s;erious attention. Make no demands of the Thebans; at this conjuncture
it would be di&s;honourable: a&s;&s;ure them that your a&s;&s;i&s;tance is
ready for their acceptance, as you are ju&s;tly affected by their danger, and
have been &s;o happy as to fore&s;ee and to guard again&s;t it. If they approve
of your &s;entiments, and embrace your overtures, we &s;hall effect our great
purpo&s;e, and act with a dignity worthy of our &s;tate. But &s;hould it happen
that we are not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, what|ever misfortunes they may &s;uffer,
to them|&s;elves <PB N="98" REF="100"> &s;hall they be imputed; while your
con|duct &s;hall appear, in no one in&s;tance, incon|&s;i&s;tent with the
honour and renown of Athens."</Q></P>
<P>This oration, delivered with ea&s;e and re&s;o|lution, did not want
its due effect; it was re|ceived with univer&s;al applau&s;e, and Demo&s;thenes
him&s;elf was in&s;tantly cho&s;en to head the emba&s;&s;y which he had now
propo&s;ed. A decree, in pur|&s;uance of his advice, was drawn up in form; with
an additional clau&s;e, that a fleet of two hundred &s;ail &s;hould be fitted
out, to cruize near Thermopylae.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this, Demo&s;thenes &s;et out for Thebes, making
the more ha&s;te, as he was &s;en&s;ible that Philip might over-run Attica in
two days. Philip, on the other hand, in order to oppo&s;e the eloquence of
Demo&s;thenes, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Thebes, among whom was Python, who
particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the liveline&s;s of his orations.
But his per|&s;ua&s;ive powers were far inferior to tho&s;e of Demo&s;thenes,
who overcame all oppo&s;ition. The ma&s;culine eloquence of Demo&s;thenes was
ir|re&s;i&s;tible; and kindled in the &s;ouls of the The|bans &s;o warm a zeal
for their country, and &s;o &s;trong a pa&s;&s;ion for freedom, that they were
no longer ma&s;ters of them&s;elves; laying a&s;ide all <PB N="99" REF="101">
fear and gratitude, and all prudential con|&s;iderations.</P>
<P>That which animated Demo&s;thenes, next to his public &s;afety, was
his having to do with a man of Python's abilities; and he &s;ome time after
took occa&s;ion to value him&s;elf upon the victory he had obtained over him, 
<Q REND="inline">"I did not give way," &s;aid he, "to the boa&s;ting
Python, when he would have bore me down with a torrent of words."</Q> He
gloried more in the &s;ucce&s;s of this negociation, than of any other he had
been employed in, and &s;poke of it as his ma&s;terpiece in politics.</P>
<P>Philip, quite di&s;concerted by the union of the&s;e two nations,
&s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the Athenians, to reque&s;t them not to levy an armed
force, but to live in harmony with him. How|ever, they were too ju&s;tly
alarmed and exa&s;|perated, to li&s;ten to any accommodation; and would no
longer depend on the word of a prince, who&s;e whole aim was to deceive. In
con&s;e|quence, preparations for war were made with the utmo&s;t diligence, and
the &s;oldiery di&s;covered incredible ardour. However, many evil-di&s;|po&s;ed
per&s;ons endeavoured to extingui&s;h or damp it, by relating fatal omens, and
terrible pre|dictions, which the prie&s;te&s;s of Delphos was &s;aid to have
uttered. But Demo&s;thenes, con|fiding <PB N="100" REF="102"> firmly in the
arms of Greece, and en|couraged wonderfully by the number and bra|very of the
troops, who de&s;ired only to march again&s;t the enemy, would not &s;uffer
them to be amu&s;ed with the&s;e oracles and frivolous pre|dictions. It was on
this occa&s;ion, he &s;aid, that the prie&s;te&s;s Philipized; meaning, that it
was Philip's money that in&s;pired the prie&s;te&s;s, opened her mouth, and
made the god &s;peak whatever &s;he thought proper. He bade the Thebans
remember their Epaminondas, and the Athe|nians their Pericles; who con&s;idered
the&s;e ora|cles and predictions as idle &s;care-crows, and con&s;ulted only
their rea&s;on. The Athenian army &s;et out immediately, and marched to
Eleu&s;is; and the Thebans, &s;urpri&s;ed at the diligence of their
confederates, joined them, and waited the approach of the enemy.</P>
<P>Philip, on his part, well knowing that the bravery and &s;pirit of
his enemies wanted that direction which might enable them to improve their
advantages, and con&s;cious al&s;o of his own abilities, and the weakne&s;s of
tho&s;e generals who commanded the Greeks, determined to bring on a general
engagement, where his &s;uperior &s;kill mu&s;t appear of the greate&s;t
moment. For this purpo&s;e he took a favourable opportunity of decamping, and
led his army to the plain of <PB N="101" REF="103"> Chaeronea, a name rendered
famous by the event of this important conte&s;t. Here he cho&s;e his &s;tation,
in view of a temple dedicated to Hercules, the author of his race, as if
re&s;olved to fight in his pre&s;ence; to make him witne&s;s of the actions of
his de&s;cendant, and to com|mit his forces, and his cau&s;e, to the immediate
protection of this hero. Some ancient oracles were pre&s;erved, which &s;eemed
to point out the &s;pot on which he now encamped, as the &s;cene of &s;ome
dreadful calamity to Greece.</P>
<P>His army was formed of thirty-two thou|&s;and men, warlike,
di&s;ciplined, and long enur|ed to the toils and dangers of the field; but this
body was compo&s;ed of different nations and countries, who had each their
di&s;tinct, and &s;eparate views and intere&s;ts. The army of the confederates
did not amount to thirty thou&s;and complete; of which the Athenians and
Thebans furni&s;hed the greate&s;t part: the re&s;t was formed of the
Corinthians and Pelo|pone&s;ians. The &s;ame motives, and the &s;ame zeal,
influenced and animated them. All were equally affected by the event; and all
equally re&s;olved to conquer or die in defence of liberty.</P>
<P>On the eve of the deci&s;ive day, Diogenes, the famous cynic, who
had long looked with <PB N="102" REF="104"> equal contempt on either party, was
led by curio&s;ity to vi&s;it the camps as an unconcerned &s;pectator. In the
Macedonian camp, where his character and per&s;on were not known, he was
&s;topped by the guards, and conducted to Philip's tent. The king expre&s;&s;ed
&s;urpri&s;e at a &s;tranger's pre&s;uming to approach his camp; and a&s;ked,
with &s;everity, Whether he came as a &s;py? 
<Q REND="inline">"Yes," &s;aid Diogenes, "I am come to &s;py upon
your vanity and ambition, who thus wantonly &s;et your life and kingdom to the
hazard of an hour."</Q></P>
<P>And now the fatal morning appeared, which was for ever to decide the
cau&s;e of liberty, and the empire of Greece. Before the ri&s;ing of the &s;un,
both armies were ranged in order of battle. The Thebans, commanded by
Theogenes, a man of but moderate abilities in war, and &s;u|&s;pected of
corruption, obtained the po&s;t of honour on the right wing of the confederated
Greeks; with that famous body in the front, called the Sacred Band, formed of
generous and warlike youths, connected and endeared to each other by all the
noble enthu&s;ia&s;m of love and friend&s;hip. The center was formed of the
Corinthians and Pelopone&s;ians; and the Athenians compo&s;ed the left wing,
led by their generals, Ly&s;icles and Chares. On <PB N="103" REF="105"> the
left of the Macedonian army &s;tood Alexander, at the head of a cho&s;en body
of noble Macedo|nians, &s;upported by the famous cavalry of The&s;&s;aly. As
this prince was then but nineteen years old, his father was careful to curb his
youthful impetuo&s;ity, and to direct his valour; and for this purpo&s;e
&s;urrounded him with a number of experienced officers. In the center were
placed tho&s;e Greeks who had united with Philip, and on who&s;e courage he had
the lea&s;t dependence; while the king him&s;elf command|ed on the right wing,
where his renowned phalanx &s;tood, to oppo&s;e the impetuo&s;ity with which
the Athenians were well known to begin their on&s;et.</P>
<P>The charge began on each &s;ide with all the courage and violence
which ambition, revenge, the love of glory, and the love of liberty, could
excite in the &s;everal combatants. Alexander, at the head of the Macedonian
nobles, fir&s;t fell, with all the fury of youthful courage, on the Sacred Band
of Thebas; which &s;u&s;tained his attack with a bravery and vigour worthy of
its former fame. The gallant youths who com|po&s;ed this body, not being
timely, or not duly &s;upported by their countrymen, bore up for a while
again&s;t the torrent of the enemy; till at <PB N="104" REF="106"> length,
oppre&s;&s;ed and overpowered by &s;upe|rior numbers, without yielding or
turning their backs on their a&s;&s;ailants; they &s;unk down on that ground
where they had been originally &s;tationed, each by the &s;ide of his darling
friend, rai&s;ing up a bulwark by their bodies again&s;t the progre&s;s of the
army. But the young prince and his forces, in all the enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardor of
valour, animated by &s;ucce&s;s, pu&s;hed on through all the carnage, and over
all the heaps of &s;lain, and fell furiou&s;ly on the main body of the Thebans;
where they were oppo&s;ed with ob&s;tinate and deliberate cou|rage, and the
conte&s;t was for &s;ome time &s;up|ported with mutual violence.</P>
<P>The Athenians at the &s;ame time on the right wing, fought with a
&s;pirit and intrepidity, worthy of the character which they boa&s;ted, and of
the cau&s;e by which they were animated. Many brave efforts were exerted on
each &s;ide, and &s;ucce&s;s was for &s;ome time doubtful; till at length part
of the center, and the left wing of the Macedonians, (except the phalanx)
yielded to the impetuous attack of the Athenians, and fled with &s;ome
precipitation. Happy had it been on that day for Greece, if the conduct and
abilities of the Athenian generals had been equal to the valour of their
&s;oldiers! but the&s;e brave <PB N="105" REF="107"> champions of liberty were
led on by the de|&s;picable creatures of intrigue and cabal. Tran&s;|ported by
the advantage now obtained, the pre&s;umptuous Ly&s;icles cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Come on, my gallant countrymen; the victory is
ours; let us pur&s;ue the&s;e cowards, and drive them to Macedon:"</Q> and
thus, in&s;tead of im|proving their happy opportunity, by charging the phalanx
in flank, and &s;o breaking this formidable body, the Athenians wildly and
precipitately pre&s;&s;ed forward, in pur&s;uit of the flying enemy;
them&s;elves in all the tumult and di&s;order of a rout. Philip &s;aw this
fatal error with the contempt of a &s;kilful general, and the &s;ecret
exultation ari&s;ing from the a&s;&s;u|rance of approaching victory. He coolly
ob|&s;erved to tho&s;e officers that &s;tood round him, That the Athenians knew
not how to conquer; and ordered his phalanx to change its po&s;ition, and, by a
&s;udden evolution, to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an adjacent eminence. From
thence they marched deliberately down, firm and collected, and fell, with their
united force, on the Athe|nians, now confident of &s;ucce&s;s, and blind to
their danger. The &s;hock was irre&s;i&s;tible; they were at once overwhelmed;
many of them lay cru&s;hed by the weight of the enemy, and expiring by their
wounds; while the re&s;t e&s;caped <PB N="106" REF="108"> from the dreadful
&s;laughter, by a &s;hameful and precipitate flight; bearing down, and hurrying
away with them, tho&s;e troops which had been &s;tationed for their &s;upport.
And here the re|nowned orator and &s;tate&s;man, who&s;e noble &s;entiments and
&s;pirited harangues had rai&s;ed the courage on this day &s;o eminently
exerted, betrayed that weakne&s;s which has &s;ullied his great character. He
alone, of all his country|men, advanced to the charge, cold and di&s;|mayed;
and, at the very fir&s;t appearance of a rever&s;e of fortune, in an agony of
terror, turned his back, ca&s;t away that &s;hield which he had adorned with
this in&s;cription, in golden characters, To Good Fortune; and appeared the
foremo&s;t in the general rout. The ridicule and malice of his enemies,
related, or perhaps invented another &s;hameful circum&s;tance; that being
impeded in his flight by &s;ome brambles, his imagination was &s;o
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the pre|&s;ence of an enemy, that he loudly cried out
for quarter.</P>
<P>While Philip was thus triumphant on his &s;ide, Alexander continued
the conflict on the other wing, and at length broke the Thebans in &s;pight of
all their acts of valour, who now fled from the field, and were pur&s;ued with
great carnage. The center of the confederates was <PB N="107" REF="109"> thus
totally abandoned to the fury of a victori|ous enemy. But enough of &s;laughter
had al|ready been made; more than one thou&s;and of the Athenians lay dead on
the field of battle, two thou&s;and were made pri&s;oners, and the lo&s;s of
the Thebans was not inferior. Philip therefore determined to conclude his
important victory, by an act of apparent clemency, which his ambition and
policy really dictated. He gave orders that the Greeks &s;hould be &s;pared,
con&s;cious of his own de&s;igns, and &s;till expect|ing to appear in the field
the head and leader of that body which he had now completely &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>Philip was tran&s;ported with this victory be|yond mea&s;ure, and
having drank to exce&s;s at an entertainment which he gave upon that
oc|ca&s;ion, went into the field of battle, where he in&s;ulted over the
&s;lain, and upbraided the pri|&s;oners with their misfortunes. He leaped and
danced about in a frantic manner, and with an air of burle&s;que merriment
&s;ung the beginning of the decree, which Demo&s;thenes had drawn up as a
declaration of the war again&s;t him. Demades, who was of the number of the
pri&s;oners, had the courage to reproach him with this unge|nerous behaviour,
telling him, That fortune had given him the part of Agamemnon, but 
<PB N="108" REF="110"> that he was acting that of Ther&s;ites. He was &s;o
&s;truck with the ju&s;tne&s;s of this reproof, that it wrought a thorough
change in him; and he was &s;o far from being offended at Demades, that he
immediately gave him his liberty, and &s;hewed him afterwards great marks of
honour and friend&s;hip. He likewi&s;e relieved all the Athenian captives, and
without ran&s;om; and when they found him &s;o generou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed
towards them, they made a demand of their baggage, with every thing el&s;e that
had been taken from them; but to that Philip replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"Surely they think I have not beat them."</Q> This
di&s;charge of the pri&s;oners was a&s;cribed in a great mea&s;ure to Demades,
who is &s;aid to have new-modelled Philip. and to have &s;often|ed his temper
with the Attic graces, as Dio|dorus expre&s;&s;es it: indeed Philip him&s;elf
acknow|ledged upon another occa&s;ion, that his fre|quent conver&s;e with the
Athenian orators, had been of great u&s;e to him in correcting his mo|rals.
Ju&s;tin repre&s;ents his carriage after the battle in a very different light;
alleging that he took abundance of pains to di&s;&s;emble his joy; that he
affected great mode&s;ty and compa&s;&s;ion, and was not &s;een to laugh; that
he would have no &s;acri&s;ice, no crowns nor perfumes; that he forbade all
kinds of &s;ports; and did nothing <PB N="109" REF="111"> that might make him
appear to the conquerors to be elated, nor to the conquered, to be in|&s;olent.
But this account &s;eems to have been confounded with others which were given
of him, after his being reformed by Demades. It is certain that after his
fir&s;t tran&s;port was over, and that he began to recollect him&s;elf, he
&s;hewed great humanity to the Athenians; and that in order &s;till to keep
mea&s;ures with them, he renewed the peace. But the The|bans, who had renounced
their alliance with him, he treated in another manner. He who affected to be as
much ma&s;ter of his allies as of his &s;ubjects, could not ea&s;ily pardon
tho&s;e who had de&s;erted him in &s;o critical a conjunc|ture. Wherefore he
not only took ran&s;om for their pri&s;oners, but made them pay for leave to
bury their dead. After the&s;e &s;everities, and after having placed a &s;trong
garri&s;on over them, he granted them a peace.</P>
<P>We are told that I&s;ocrates, the mo&s;t cele|brated rhetorician of
that age, who loved his country with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, could not
&s;urvive the lo&s;s and ignominy with which it was covered, by the lo&s;s of
the battle of Chaeronea. The in&s;tant he received the news of its being
uncertain what u&s;e Philip would make of his victory, and determined to die a 
<PB N="110" REF="112"> freeman, he ha&s;tened his end by ab&s;taining from
food; he was four&s;core and eighteen years of age. This defeat was attributed
chief|ly to the ill conduct of the Generals Ly&s;icles and Chares; the former
whereof the Athenians put to death at the in&s;tance of Lycurgus, who had great
credit and influence with the people, but was a &s;evere judge, and a mo&s;t
bitter accu&s;er. 
<Q REND="inline">"You Ly&s;icles, &s;aid he, were general of the
army; a thou&s;and citizens were &s;lain, two thou&s;and taken pri&s;oners; a
trophy has been erected to the di&s;honour of this city, and all Greece is
en&s;laved. You had the command when all the&s;e things happened; and yet you
dare to live, and view the light of the &s;un, and blu&s;h not to appear
publicly in the forum; you Ly&s;icles, who are born the monu|ment of your
country's &s;hame!"</Q> This Lycur|gus was one of the orators of the fir&s;t
rank, and free from the general corruption which then reigned among them. He
managed the public trea&s;ure for twelve years with great uprightne&s;s, and
had all his life long the re|putation of a man of honour and virtue. He
encrea&s;ed the &s;hipping, &s;upplied the ar&s;enal, drove the bad men out of
the city, and fram|ed &s;everal good laws. He kept an exact re|gi&s;ter of
every thing he did during his ad|mini&s;tration; <PB N="111" REF="113"> and
when that was expired, he cau&s;ed it to be fixed up to a pillar, that every
body might be at liberty to in&s;pect it, and to cen&s;ure his conduct. He
carried this point &s;o far, that, in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s he ordered
him|&s;elf to be carried to the Senate-hou&s;e to give a public account of all
his actions, and after he had refuted one who accu&s;ed him there, he went home
and died. Notwith&s;tanding the au&s;terity of his temper, he was a great
en|courager of the &s;tage; which though it had been carried to an exce&s;s
that was manife&s;tly hurtful to the public, he &s;till looked upon as the
be&s;t &s;chool to in&s;truct and poli&s;h the minds of the people. And to this
end, he kept up a &s;pirit of emulation among the writers of Tragedy, and
erected the &s;tatues of Ae&s;chylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. He left three
&s;ons who were unworthy of him, and behaved &s;o ill, that they were all put
in pri&s;on; but Demo&s;thenes, out of regard to the memory of their father,
got them di&s;charged.</P>
<P>It does not appear that Chares underwent any pro&s;ecution for his
&s;hare of this action; though according to his general character, he
de&s;erved it as much or more than his colleague. For he had no talent for
command, and was very little different from a common &s;oldier. 
<PB N="112" REF="114"> Timotheus &s;aid of him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That in&s;tead of being a general, he was fitter to
carry the general's baggage."</Q> His per&s;on indeed was of that robu&s;t kind
of make; and it was that which &s;erved in &s;ome mea&s;ure to recommend him to
the people. But he was more a man of plea&s;ure than fatigue. In his military
expe|ditions, he was wont to carry with him a band of mu&s;ic; and he defrayed
the expence of it out of the &s;oldiers' pay. Notwith&s;tanding his want of
abilities, he had a thorough good opi|nion of him&s;elf. He was vain and
po&s;itive, bold and boi&s;terous; a great undertaker, and always ready to
warrant &s;ucce&s;s; but his per|formances &s;eldom an&s;wered; and hence it
was, that the promi&s;es of Chares became a proverb: And yet as little as he
was to be depended on, he had his partizans among the people, and among the
orators, by who&s;e means he got him&s;elf to be frequently employed, and
others to be excluded who were more capable.</P>
<P>But it was Demo&s;thenes who &s;eemed to have been the principal
cau&s;e of the terrible &s;hock which Athens received at this time, and which
gave its power &s;uch a wound, as it never reco|vered. However, at the very
in&s;tant the Athe|nians heard of this bloody overthrow, which affected &s;o
great a number of families, when it <PB N="113" REF="115"> would have been no
wonder, had the multi|tude, &s;eized with terror and alarms, given way to an
emotion of blind zeal, again&s;t the man whom they might have con&s;idered in
&s;ome mea|&s;ure as the author of this dreadful calamity; even at this very
in&s;tant, I &s;ay, the people &s;ub|mitted entirely to the councils of
Demo&s;thenes. The precautions that were taken to po&s;t guards to rai&s;e the
walls, and to repair the ditches, were all in con&s;equence of his advice. He
him&s;elf was appointed to &s;upply the city with provi&s;ions, and to repair
the walls, which latter commi&s;&s;ion he executed with &s;o much
genero|&s;ity, that it acquired him the greate&s;t honour; and for which, at
the reque&s;t of Cte&s;iphon, a crown of gold was decreed him as a reward for
his having pre&s;ented the commonwealth with a &s;um of money out of his own
e&s;tate, &s;uffici|ent to defray what was wanting of the &s;ums for repairing
the walls.</P>
<P>On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, that is, after the battle of Chaeronea,
&s;uch orators as oppo&s;ed Demo&s;thenes, having all ri&s;en up in concert
again&s;t him, and having cited him to take his trial according to law, the
people not only de|clared him innocent of the &s;everal accu&s;ations laid to
his charge, but conferred more honours upon him than he had enjoyed before;
&s;o <PB N="114" REF="116"> &s;trongly did the veneration they had for his zeal
and fidelity overbalance the efforts of calumny and malice.</P>
<P>But the people did not &s;top here. The bones of &s;uch as had been
killed in the battle of Chaeronea having been brought to Athens to be interred,
they appointed Demo&s;thenes to compo&s;e the eulogium of tho&s;e brave men; a
manife&s;t proof that they did not a&s;cribe to him the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the
battle, but to Provi|dence only, who di&s;po&s;es of human events at
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It was in this year that Ae&s;chines drew up an accu&s;ation
again&s;t Cte&s;iphon, or rather again&s;t Demo&s;thenes, which was the mo&s;t
remarkable that ever appeared before any tribunal; not &s;o much for the object
of the conte&s;t, as for the greatne&s;s and ability of the &s;peakers.
Cte&s;iphon, a partizan and friend of Demo&s;t|henes, brought a cau&s;e before
the a&s;&s;embly of the people, in which he urged that a decree &s;hould be
pa&s;&s;ed, giving a golden crown to Demo&s;thenes. This decree was &s;trongly
op|po&s;ed by Ae&s;chines, the rival of Demo&s;thenes, as well in eloquence as
in ambition.</P>
<P>No cau&s;e ever excited &s;o much curio&s;ity, nor was pleaded with
&s;o much pomp. Peo|ple flocked to it from all parts, and <PB N="115" REF="117"> they had great rea&s;on for &s;o doing; for what &s;ight could be
nobler, than a conflict be|tween two orators, each of them excellent in his
way, both formed by nature, im|proved by art, and animated by perpetual
di&s;&s;entions, and an implacable animo&s;ity again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>The juncture &s;eemed to favour Ae&s;chines very much; for the
Macedonian party, whom he al|ways befriended, was very powerful in Athens,
e&s;pecially after the ruin of Thebes. Never|thele&s;s Ae&s;chines lo&s;t his
cau&s;e, and was ju&s;tly &s;entenced to bani&s;hment for his ra&s;h
accu&s;ation. He thereupon went, and &s;ettled him&s;elf in Rhodes, where he
opened a &s;chool of elo|quence, the fame and glory of which con|tinued for
many ages. He began his lectures with the two orations that had occa&s;ioned
his bani&s;hment. Great encomiums were given to that of Ae&s;chines; but when
they heard that of Demo&s;thenes, the plaudits and acclamations were redoubled.
And it was then he &s;poke the&s;e words, &s;o greatly laudable in the mouth of
an enemy and a rival: 
<Q REND="inline">"Alas! what applau&s;es would you not have
be&s;towed, had you heard Demo&s;thenes &s;peak it him&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P>Demo&s;thenes thus become victor, made a good u&s;e of his
conque&s;t. For the in&s;tant Ae&s;chines left <PB N="116" REF="118"> Athens,
in order to embark for Rhodes, De|mo&s;thenes ran after him, and forced him to
ac|cept of a pur&s;e of money. On this occa&s;ion, Ae&s;chines cried out, How
will it be po&s;&s;ible for me not to regret a country, in which I leave an
enemy more generous, than I can hope to find friends in any other part of the
world?</P>
<P>In the mean time, Philip had his ambition plea&s;ed, but not
&s;atisfied with his la&s;t victory; he had one object long in view, and that
he never lo&s;t &s;ight of; this was to get him&s;elf ap|pointed in the
A&s;&s;embly of the Greeks, their chief general again&s;t the Per&s;ians. It
had long been the object, not only of the confederate &s;tates, but al&s;o of
the neighbouring Greek nations, to revenge upon the kingdom of Per|&s;ia, the
injuries they had &s;u&s;tained from it; and to work the total de&s;truction of
that Empire. This was an object which had early inflamed the mind of Philip,
and his late victory paved the way to it. He therefore got him&s;elf de|clared
Generali&s;&s;imo of the Greek forces, and accordingly made preparations to
invade that mighty Empire.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t Philip was thus &s;ucce&s;sful in poli|tics and war,
the dome&s;tic divi&s;ions that reign|ed in his family, embittered his
happine&s;s, and at la&s;t cau&s;ed his de&s;truction. He had mar|ried 
<PB N="117" REF="119"> Olympias, the daughter of the king of Epirus, and the
early part of their union was crowned with happine&s;s; but her ill temper
&s;oon clouded that dawn which promi&s;ed &s;o much felicity; &s;he was
naturally jealous, vin|dictive and pa&s;&s;ionate, and their di&s;&s;entions
were carried to &s;uch a degree, that Philip was often heard to wi&s;h for
death. But his pa&s;&s;ion for Cleopatra, niece to Attalus, his general,
com|pleted their &s;eparation. As Cleopatra was no le&s;s amiable in her temper
and accompli&s;h|ments than in the extraordinary graces of her per&s;on, Philip
conceived that he &s;hould con|&s;ult his own happine&s;s mo&s;t effectually,
by form|ing an inviolable and perpetual union with this lady; and, without the
lea&s;t he&s;itation, re&s;olv|ed to &s;eparate him&s;elf for ever from the
prin|ce&s;s who had long appeared &s;o great an enemy to his tranquillity. In
vain did Alexander his &s;on remon&s;trate, that by divorcing Olympias, and
engaging in a &s;econd marriage, he expo&s;ed him to the danger of contending
with a num|ber of competitors for the crown, and render|ed his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
precarious. 
<Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, &s;aid the king, if I create you a number
of competi|tors, you will have the glorious opportunity of exerting your&s;elf
to &s;urpa&s;s them in merit. Thus &s;hall their rival&s;hip by no means affect
<PB N="118" REF="120"> your title."</Q> His marriage with Cleopatra was now
declared in form, and celebrated with all the grandeur and &s;olemnity which
the great occa&s;ion demanded. The young prince how|ever di&s;&s;atisfied, was
yet obliged to attend on the&s;e &s;olemnities, and &s;at in &s;ilent
indignation at that fea&s;t which proclaimed the di&s;grace of his mother. In
&s;uch circum&s;tances, his youth|ful and impetuous mind could not but be
&s;u|&s;ceptible of the &s;lighte&s;t irritation. Attalus the uncle of the new
queen, forgetting that ju&s;t caution, which &s;hould have taught him to be
&s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;ervant to avoid offending the prince, intoxicated by the
honours paid to his kin&s;woman, as well as by the pre&s;ent fe&s;ti|vity, was
ra&s;h enough to call publicly on the Macedonian nobles to pour out their
libations to the gods, that they might grant the king the happy fruits of the
pre&s;ent nuptials, and legitimate heirs to his throne. Wretch! cried
Alexander, with his eyes &s;parkling with that fury and vexation which he had
till now &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, do&s;t thou then call me ba&s;tard? and in&s;tantly
darted his goblet at Attalus, who re|turned the outrage with double violence.
Cla|mour and confu&s;ion aro&s;e, and the king, in a &s;udden fit of rage,
&s;natched his &s;word, and flew directly towards his &s;on. His
precipita|tion, <PB N="119" REF="121"> his lamene&s;s, and the quantity of wine
in which he had by this time indulged, hap|pily di&s;appointed his ra&s;h
purpo&s;e; he &s;tum|bled and fell on the floor, while Alexander, with an
unpardonable in&s;olence, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"Behold, ye Macedonians! this is the king who is
preparing to lead you into A&s;ia; &s;ee where in pa&s;&s;ing from one table to
another, he is fallen to the ground."</Q></P>
<P>Philip however, did not lo&s;e &s;ight of the con|que&s;ts of
A&s;ia. Full of the mighty project he re|volved, he con&s;ulted the gods to
know what would be the event of it; and the prie&s;te&s;s replied, The victim
is already crowned, his end draws nigh, and he will &s;oon be &s;acrificed.
Philip hearing this, did not he&s;itate a moment, but interpreted the oracle in
his own favour; the ambiguity of which ought at lea&s;t to have kept him in
&s;ome &s;u&s;pence. In order therefore, that he might be in a condition to
apply entirely to his expedi|tion again&s;t the Per&s;ians, and elevate
him&s;elf &s;olely to the conque&s;t of A&s;ia, he di&s;patched with all
po&s;&s;ible diligence his dome&s;tic affairs. After this, he offered up a
&s;olemn &s;acrifice to the gods; and prepared to celebrate with incredible
magnificence in Egae, a city of Macedonia, the nuptials of Cleopatra his
daughter, whom he gave in marriage to Alexander king of Epirus, 
<PB N="120" REF="122"> and brother to Olympias his queen. He had invited to it
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons of Greece, and heaped upon them
friend&s;hip and honours of every kind, by way of gratitude for electing him
Generali&s;&s;imo of the Greeks. The cities made their court to him in
emulation of each other, by &s;ending him gold crowns; and Athens
di&s;tingui&s;hed its zeal above all the re&s;t. Neoptolemus, the poet, had
written purpo&s;ely for that fe&s;tival, a tragedy entitled Cinyras, in which
under borrowed names, he repre&s;ented this prince as already victor over
Darius, and ma&s;ter of A&s;ia. Philip li&s;tened to the&s;e happy pre&s;ages
with joy; and, comparing them with the an&s;wer of the oracle, a&s;&s;ured
him&s;elf of conque&s;t. The day after the nuptials, games, and &s;hows were
&s;olemnized. As the&s;e formed part of the religious wor&s;hip, there were
car|ried in it, with great pomp and ceremony, twelve &s;tatues of the gods,
carved with in|imitable art; a thirteenth that &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them all in
magnificence, repre&s;ented Philip as a god. The hour for his leaving the
palace arrived, he went forth in a white robe; and advanced with an air of
maje&s;ty, in the mid&s;t of acclamations, towards the theatre, where an
infinite multitude of Mace|donians, <PB N="121" REF="123"> as well as
foreigners, waited his coming with impatience.</P>
<P>But this magnificence only &s;erved to make the cata&s;trophe more
remarkable, and to add &s;plendor to ruin. Some time before, Attalus, inflamed
with wine at an entertainment, had in&s;ulted in the mo&s;t &s;hocking manner
Pau&s;anias a young Macedonian nobleman. The latter had long endeavoured to
revenge the cruel affront, and was perpetually imploring the king's ju&s;tice.
But Philip, unwilling to di&s;gu&s;t Attalus, uncle to Cleopatra, whom, as was
before ob&s;erved, he had married after his divorcing Olympias his fir&s;t
queen, would never li&s;ten to Pau&s;anias's complaints. However, to con&s;ole
him in &s;ome mea&s;ure, and to expre&s;s the high e&s;teem he had for, and the
great confidence he repo&s;ed in him, he made him one of the chief officers of
his life-guard. But this was not what the young Macedonian required, who&s;e
anger now &s;welling to fury again&s;t his judge, he formed the de&s;ign of
wiping out his &s;hame, by imbruing his hands in the blood of his
&s;overeign.</P>
<P>And now while this unhappy youth continu|ed brooding over tho&s;e
malignant pa&s;&s;ions which di&s;tracted and corroded his mind, he happened to
go into the &s;chool of one Hermo|crates, who profe&s;&s;ed to teach
philo&s;ophy; to <PB N="122" REF="124"> whom he propo&s;ed the following
que&s;tion: What &s;hall that man do, who wi&s;hes to tran&s;|mit his name with
lu&s;tre to po&s;terity? Hermo|crates, either artfully and from de&s;ign, or
the natural malignity of his temper, replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"He mu&s;t kill him who hath atchieved the
greate&s;t actions; thus &s;hall the memory of the hero be joined with his who
&s;lew him, and both de|&s;cend together to po&s;terity."</Q> This was a maxim
highly agreeable to Pau&s;anias, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of his mind;
and thus various ac|cidents and circum&s;tances, concurred to in|flame tho&s;e
dangerous pa&s;&s;ions which now po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him, and to prompt him to
the dreadful purpo&s;e of &s;atiating his revenge.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;olemnity was that which Pau|&s;anias cho&s;e to put
his dreadful de&s;ign into execution. Philip, cloathed in a white flowing robe,
waving in &s;oft and graceful folds, the habiliments in which the Grecian
deities were u&s;ually repre&s;ented, moved forward with an heart filled with
triumph and exultation, while the admiring crowds &s;houted forth their
flattering applau&s;e. His guards had orders to keep at a con&s;iderable
di&s;tance from his per&s;on, to &s;hew that the king confided in the
affections of his people, and had not the lea&s;t apprehen|&s;ions of danger
amid&s;t all this mixed concour&s;e <PB N="123" REF="125"> of different
&s;tates and nations. Unhappily the danger was but too near him. The injured
Pau&s;anias had not yet forgot his wrongs, but &s;till retained tho&s;e
terrible impre&s;&s;ions which the &s;en&s;e of the indignity he had received,
and the artful and intere&s;ted repre&s;entations of others, fixed deeply in
his mind. He cho&s;e this fatal morning for the execution of his re|venge on
the prince who had denied reparation to his injured honour. His de&s;ign had
been for &s;ome time premeditated, and now was the dreadful moment of effecting
it. As Philip marched on in all his pride and pomp, this young Macedonian
&s;lipped through the crowd, and with a de&s;perate and malignant re&s;olution
waited his approach in a narrow pa&s;&s;age, ju&s;t at the entrance into the
theatre. The king advanced towards him, Pau&s;anias drew his poniard, plunged
it into his heart, and the conqueror of Greece, and terror of A&s;ia, fell
pro&s;trate to the ground, and in&s;tantly expired.</P>
<P>The murderer flew towards the gates of the city, where there &s;tood
hor&s;es ready to favour his e&s;cape, which Olympias her&s;elf is &s;aid to
have prepared. The tumult and confu&s;ion was &s;uch as might be expected from
&s;o fatal an event; &s;ome of the Macedonians crowded round the fallen king
with officious and ineffectual <PB N="124" REF="126"> care, while others
pur&s;ued Pau&s;anias. Among the&s;e were Perdicas, Attalus and Leonatus; the
fir&s;t who excelled in &s;wiftne&s;s came up to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, where he
was ju&s;t preparing to mount his hor&s;e, but being by his precipitation
intangled in &s;ome vines, a violent effort to ex|tricate his foot, brought him
&s;uddenly to the ground. As he prepared to ri&s;e, Perdicas was upon him, and
with his companions, &s;oon di&s;patched him by the repeated wounds which their
fury inflicted. His body was immediately hung on a gibbet, but, in the morning
appear|ed crowned with a golden diadem; the only means by which Olympias could
now expre&s;s her implacable re&s;entment. In a few days in|deed, &s;he took a
further occa&s;ion of publi&s;hing her triumph and exultation in her
hu&s;band's fall, by paying the &s;ame funeral honours to Pau&s;anias, which
were prepared for Philip; both bodies were burnt on the &s;ame pile, and the
a&s;hes of both depo&s;ited in the &s;ame tomb. She is even &s;aid to have
prevailed on the Mace|donians to pay annual honours to Pau&s;anias; as if &s;he
feared that the &s;hare &s;he had taken in the death of Philip, &s;hould not be
&s;ufficiently known to the world. She con&s;ecrated to Apollo the dagger which
had been the in&s;tru|ment of the fatal deed, in&s;cribed with the name 
<PB N="125" REF="127"> Myrtalis, the name which &s;he had borne when their
loves fir&s;t began.</P>
<P>Thus died Philip, who&s;e virtues and vices were directed and
proportioned to his am|bition. His mo&s;t &s;hining and exalted qualities were
influenced in a great mea&s;ure by his love of power; and even the mo&s;t
exceptionable parts of his conduct were principally deter|mined by their
conveniency and expediency. If he was unju&s;t, he was, like Cae&s;ar, unju&s;t
for the &s;ake of Empire. If he gloried by the &s;uc|ce&s;s acquired by his
virtues and his intellectual accompli&s;hments, rather than in that which the
force of arms could gain, the rea&s;on which he him&s;elf a&s;&s;igned, points
out his true prin|ciple. 
<Q REND="inline">"In the former ca&s;e, &s;aid he, the glory is
intirely mine; in the other, my ge|nerals and &s;oldiers have their
&s;hare."</Q></P>
<P>The news of Philip's death was a joyful &s;ur|prize in Greece, and
particularly in Athens, where the people crowned them&s;elves with garlands,
and decreed a crown to Pau&s;anias. They &s;acrificed to the gods for their
deliverance, and &s;ung &s;ongs of triumph; as if Philip had been &s;lain by
them in battle. But this exce&s;s of joy did ill become them. It was looked
upon as an ungenerous and unmanly in&s;ult upon the a&s;hes of a murdered
prince, and of <PB N="126" REF="128"> one whom they ju&s;t before had revered,
and crouched to in the mo&s;t abject manner. The&s;e immoderate tran&s;ports
were rai&s;ed in them by Demo&s;thenes, who having the fir&s;t intelligence of
Philip's death, went into the a&s;&s;embly unu&s;u|ally gay and chearful, with
a chaplet on his head, and in a rich habit, though it was then but the
&s;eventh day after the death of his daughter. From this circum&s;tance,
Plutarch, at the &s;ame time that he condemns the beha|viour of the Athenians
in general upon this occa&s;ion, takes an opportunity to ju&s;tify
Demo&s;t|henes, and extols him as a patriot, for not &s;uffering his dome&s;tic
afflictions to interfere with the good fortune of the commonwealth. But he
certainly might have acted the part of a good citizen with more decency, and
not have given up to in&s;ult, what was due to good manners.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. From the Birth of ALEXANDER, to his &s;etting out for
ASIA.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 364<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. Ante J. C. 356.</NOTE> ALEXANDER the &s;on of Philip a&s;cend|ed
the throne upon the death of his father, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
kingdom rendered flouri&s;hing and powerful by the policy of the preceding
reign.</P>
<P>He came into the world the very day the celebrated Temple of Diana
at Ephe&s;us was burnt, upon which occa&s;ion the report goes, that Hege&s;ias
the hi&s;torian was heard to &s;ay, That it was no wonder the temple was burnt,
as Diana was that day employed at the delivery of Olympias, to facilitate the
birth of Alexander.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion which prevailed mo&s;t in Alex|ander, even from his
tender years, was ambi|tion, and an ardent de&s;ire of glory; but not for every
&s;pecies of glory. Philip like a &s;ophi&s;t, valued him&s;elf upon his
eloquence, and the beauty of his &s;tyle; and had the vanity to have engraved
on his coins the &s;everal victories he <PB N="128" REF="130"> had won at the
Olympick games in the chariot race. But it was not after &s;uch empty honours
that his &s;on a&s;pired. His friends a&s;ked him one day, Whether he would not
be pre&s;ent at the games abovementioned, in order to di&s;pute the prize
be&s;towed on that occa&s;ion? for he was very &s;wift of foot. He an&s;wered,
That he would contend in them, provided kings were to be his antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>Every time news was brought him that his father had taken &s;ome
city, or gained &s;ome great battle, Alexander &s;o far from &s;haring in the
general joy, u&s;ed to &s;ay in a plaintive tone of voice, to the young
per&s;ons that were brought up with him, Friends, my father will po&s;&s;e&s;s
him&s;elf of every thing, and leave nothing for me to do.</P>
<P>One day &s;ome amba&s;&s;adors from the king of Per&s;ia being
arrived at court during Philip's ab&s;ence, Alexander gave them &s;o kind and
&s;o polite a reception, and regaled them in &s;o noble and generous a manner
as charmed them all; but that which mo&s;t &s;urprized them was, the good
&s;en&s;e and judgment he di&s;covered in the &s;everal conver&s;ations they
had with him. He did not propo&s;e to them any thing that was trifling, and
like one of his age; &s;uch for in&s;tance, as enquiring about the &s;o much 
<PB N="129" REF="131"> boa&s;ted gardens &s;u&s;pended in the air, the riches
and magnificence of the palace; and court of the king of Per&s;ia, which
excited the admi|ration of the whole world; the famous golden plantane-tree;
and that golden vine, the grapes of which were of emeralds, carbuncles, rubies,
and all &s;orts of precious &s;tones, under which the Per&s;ian monarch was
&s;aid frequently to give audience. Alexander, I &s;ay, a&s;ked them
que&s;|tions of a quite different nature; enquiring which was the road to Upper
A&s;ia; the di&s;tance of the &s;everal places; in what the &s;trength and
power of the king of Per&s;ia con&s;i&s;ted; in what part of the battle he
fought; how he behaved towards his enemies, and in what manner he governed his
&s;ubjects. The&s;e amba&s;&s;adors ad|mired him all the while; and perceiving,
even at that time, how great he might one day be|come, they ob&s;erved, in a
few words, the dif|ference they found between Alexander and Ar|taxerxes, by
&s;aying one to another, 
<Q REND="inline">"This young prince is great, and ours is rich: that
man mu&s;t be va&s;tly in&s;ignificant, who has no other merit than his
riches!"</Q></P>
<P>So ripe a judgment in this young prince, was owing as much to the
good education which had been given him, as to the happine&s;s 
<PB N="130" REF="132"> of his natural parts. Several preceptors were appointed
to teach him all &s;uch arts and &s;ci|ences as are worthy the heir to a great
king|dom; and the chief of the&s;e was Leonidas, a per&s;on of the mo&s;t
&s;evere morals, and a relation to the queen. This Leonidas, in their journies
together, u&s;ed frequently to look into the trunks where his beds and cloaths
were laid, in order to &s;ee if Olympias, his mother, had not put &s;ome|thing
&s;uperfluous into them, which might ad|mini&s;ter to delicacy and luxury.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t &s;ervice Philip did his &s;on, was appointing
Ari&s;totle his preceptor, the mo&s;t famous and the mo&s;t learned
philo&s;opher of his age, whom he intru&s;ted with the whole care of his
education. One of the rea&s;ons which prompted Philip to chu&s;e him a ma&s;ter
of &s;o con&s;picuous reputation and merit, was, as he him&s;elf tells us, that
his &s;on might avoid committing a great many faults, of which he him&s;elf had
been guilty.</P>
<P>Philip was &s;en&s;ible how great a trea&s;ure he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
in the per&s;on of Ari&s;totle; for which rea&s;on he &s;ettled a very genteel
&s;tipend upon him, and afterwards rewarded his pains and care in an infinitely
more glorious manner; for hav|ing de&s;troyed and laid wa&s;te the city of
Stagira, <PB N="131" REF="133"> the native place of that philo&s;opher, he
rebuilt it, purely out of affection for him; rein&s;tated the inhabitants, who
had fled from it, or were made &s;laves, and gave them a fine park in the
neighbourhood of Stagira, as a place for their &s;tudies and a&s;&s;emblies.
Even in Plutarch's time, the &s;tone &s;eats which Ari&s;totle had placed there
were &s;tanding; as al&s;o &s;pacious vi&s;toes, under which tho&s;e who walked
were &s;haded from the &s;un-beams.</P>
<P>Alexander likewi&s;e di&s;covered no le&s;s e&s;teem for his
ma&s;ter, whom he believed him&s;elf bound to love as much as if he had been
his father; declaring, That he was indebted to the one for living, and to the
other for living well. The progre&s;s of the pupil was equal to the care and
abilities of the preceptor. He grew va&s;tly fond of philo&s;ophy, and learned
the &s;everal parts of it; but in a manner &s;uitable to his birth. Ari&s;totle
endeavoured to improve his judgment, by laying down &s;ure and certain rules,
by which he might di&s;tingui&s;h ju&s;t and &s;olid rea&s;oning from what is
but &s;peciou&s;ly &s;o; and by accu&s;toming him to &s;eparate in
di&s;|cour&s;e all &s;uch parts as only dazzle, from tho&s;e which are truly
&s;olid, and con&s;titute its whole value. But Alexander applied him&s;elf
chiefly <PB N="132" REF="134"> to morality, which is properly the &s;cience of
kings, becau&s;e it is the knowledge of mankind, and of their duties. This he
made his &s;erious and profound &s;tudy; and con&s;idered it even at that time
as the foundation of prudence and wi&s;e policy.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t ma&s;ter of rhetoric that antiquity could ever
boa&s;t, and who has left &s;o excellent a treati&s;e on that &s;ubject, took
care to make that &s;cience part of his pupil's education; and we find that
Alexander, even in the mid&s;t of his conque&s;t, was often very urgent with
Ari|&s;totle to &s;end him a treati&s;e on that &s;ubject. To this we owe the
work entitled Alexander's Rhetoric; in the beginning of which, Ari&s;totle
proves to him the va&s;t advantages a prince may reap from eloquence; as it
gives him the greate&s;t a&s;cendant over the minds of men, which he ought to
acquire as well by his wi&s;dom as authority. Some an&s;wers and letters of
Alexander, which are &s;till extant, &s;hew that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in its
greate&s;t perfection, that &s;trong, that manly eloquence, which abounds with
&s;en&s;e and ideas, and which is &s;o entirely free from &s;uperfluous
expre&s;&s;ions, that every &s;ingle word has its meaning; which, properly
&s;peak|ing, is the eloquence of kings.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="135"> His e&s;teem, or rather his pa&s;&s;ion for
Homer, &s;hews, not only with what vigour and &s;ucce&s;s he applied to polite
literature, but the judicious u&s;e he made of it, and the &s;olid advantages
he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf from it. He was not only prompted to peru&s;e this
poet merely out of cu|rio&s;ity, or to unbend his mind, or from a great
fondne&s;s for poetry; but his view in &s;tudy|ing this admirable writer, was
to borrow &s;uch &s;entiments from him, as were worthy a great king and
conqueror; courage, intrepidity, mag|nanimity, temperance, prudence; the art of
commanding well in war and peace. The ver&s;e which plea&s;ed him mo&s;t in
Homer, was that where Agamemnon is repre&s;ented as a good king and a brave
warrior.</P>
<P>After this, it is no wonder that Alexander &s;hould have &s;o high
an e&s;teem for this poet. Thus when, after the battle of Arbela, the
Macedonians had found, among the &s;poils of Darius, a gold box (enriched with
precious &s;tones) in which the excellent perfumes u&s;ed by that prince were
put, Alexander, who was quite covered with du&s;t, and regardle&s;s of
e&s;|&s;ences and perfumes, ordered, that this box &s;hould be employed to no
other u&s;e than to hold Homer's poems; which he believed the mo&s;t perfect,
the mo&s;t preci&s;e production of the <PB N="134" REF="136"> human mind. He
admired particularly the Iliad, which he called, The be&s;t provi&s;ion for a
warrior. He always had with him that edition of Homer which Ari&s;totle had
revi&s;ed and cor|rected, and to which the title of The Edition of the Box was
given; and he laid it with his &s;word every night under his pillow.</P>
<P>Fond, even to exce&s;s, of every kind of glory, he was
di&s;plea&s;ed with Ari&s;totle his ma&s;ter, for having publi&s;hed, in his
ab&s;ence, certain meta|phy&s;ical pieces, which he him&s;elf de&s;ired to
po&s;&s;e&s;s only; and even at the time when he was employed in the conque&s;t
of A&s;ia, and the pur|&s;uit of Darius, he wrote to him a letter, which is
&s;till extant, wherein he complains upon that very account. Alexander &s;ays
in it, That he had much rather &s;urp&s;s the re&s;t of men in the knowledge of
&s;ublime and excellent things, than in the greatne&s;s and extent of his
powers. He in like manner reque&s;ted Ari&s;totle not to &s;hew the treati&s;e
of rhetoric above mentioned to any per&s;on but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He had al&s;o a ta&s;te for the whole circle of arts, but in &s;uch
a manner as became a prince; that is, he knew the value and u&s;efulne&s;s of
them. Mu&s;ic, painting, &s;culpture, architecture, flouri&s;hed in his reign;
becau&s;e they found him both a &s;kilful judge and a generous protector; 
<PB N="135" REF="137"> who was able to di&s;tingui&s;h and to reward merit.</P>
<P>But he de&s;pi&s;ed certain trifling feats of dex|terity, that were
of no u&s;e. Some Macedo|nians admired very much a man, who em|ployed him&s;elf
very attentively in throwing &s;mall peas through the eye of a needle; which he
would do at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and with|out once mi&s;&s;ing.
Alexander &s;eeing him at this exerci&s;e, ordered him, as we are told, a
pre&s;ent &s;uitable to his employment; <HI>viz,</HI> a ba&s;ket of peas.</P>
<P>Alexander was of a &s;prightly di&s;po&s;ition, was re&s;olute, and
very tenacious of his opinion, which never gave way to force, but at the &s;ame
time would &s;ubmit immediately to rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e. It is very
difficult to treat with per&s;ons of this turn of mind: Philip accordingly,
notwith&s;tanding his double authority of king and father, believed it
nece&s;&s;ary to employ per|&s;ua&s;ion rather than force with re&s;pect to his
&s;on, and endeavoured to make him&s;elf beloved rather than feared by him.</P>
<P>An accident made him entertain a very ad|vantageous opinion of
Alexander. There had been &s;ent from The&s;&s;aly to Philip a war-hor&s;e; a
noble, &s;trong, fiery, generous bea&s;t, called <PB N="136" REF="138">
Bucephalus. The owner would not &s;ell him under thirteen talents; an immen&s;e
&s;um! The king went into the plains, attended by his courtiers, in order to
view the perfections of this hor&s;e; but, upon trial, he appeared &s;o very
fierce, and pranced about in &s;o furious a manner, that no one dared to mount
him. Philip being angry that &s;o furious and unmanageable a creature had been
&s;ent him, gave orders for their carrying him back again. Alexander, who was
pre&s;ent at that time, cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"What a noble hor&s;e we are going to lo&s;e, for
want of addre&s;s and boldne&s;s to back him!"</Q> Philip at fir&s;t
con&s;idered the&s;e words as the effect of folly and ra&s;hne&s;s, &s;o common
to young men; but as Alexander in|&s;i&s;ted &s;till more upon what he had
&s;aid, and was very much vexed to &s;ee &s;o noble a creature ju&s;t going to
be &s;ent home again, his father gave him leave to try what he could do. The
young prince overjoyed at this permi&s;&s;ion, goes up to Bucephalus, takes
hold of the bridle, and turns his head to the &s;un, having ob&s;erved, that
the thing which frighted him, was his own &s;hadow; Alexander therefore fir&s;t
&s;troked him gently with his hand, and &s;oothed him with his voice; then
&s;eeing his fiercene&s;s abate, and artfully <PB N="137" REF="139"> taking
this opportunity, he let fall his cloak, and &s;pringing &s;wiftly upon his
back, fir&s;t &s;lackened the rein, without once &s;triking or vexing him; and
when he perceived that his fire was cooled, that he was no longer &s;o furious
and violent, and wanted only to move forward, he gave him the rein, and
&s;purring him with great vigour, animated him with his voice to his full
&s;peed. While this was doing, Philip and his whole court trembled for fear,
and did not once open their lips; but when the prince, after having run his
fir&s;t heat, returned with joy and pride, at his having broke a hor&s;e which
was judged ab&s;olutely ungovernable, all the courtiers in general endeavoured
to outvie one another in their applau&s;es and congratulations; and we are
told, Philip &s;hed tears of joy on this occa&s;ion; and embracing Alexander,
after he was alighted, and ki&s;&s;ing him, he &s;aid to him, 
<Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, &s;eek a kingdom more worthy of thee, for
Macedon is below thy merit."</Q></P>
<P>Alexander upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, &s;aw him&s;elf
&s;urrounded with extreme dan|gers; the barbarous nations with whom Philip
contended during his whole reign, thought this change for their advantage, and
de&s;pi&s;ing the youth and inexperience of the young mo|narch, 
<PB N="138" REF="140"> re&s;olved to &s;eize this opportunity of regaining
their freedom, for &s;atiating them|&s;elves with plunder: nor had he le&s;s to
fear from the Greeks them&s;elves, who now thought this a convenient
opportunity to re&s;tore their ancient form of government, revenge their
for|mer injuries, and reclaim tho&s;e rights which they had enjoyed for
ages.</P>
<P>Alexander however re&s;olved to prevent their machinations, and to
give them no time to com|plete their confederacies again&s;t him. After taking
revenge upon the con&s;pirators again&s;t his father, whom he &s;lew upon his
tomb, he fir&s;t conciliated the affections of the Macedonians to him, by
freeing them from a vexatious and bodily &s;lavery, only commanding their
&s;ervice in his wars.</P>
<P>The Macedonians reflecting on his precarious &s;ituation, advi&s;ed
him to relinqui&s;h Greece, and not per&s;i&s;t in his re&s;olution of
&s;ubduing it by force; to recover by gentle methods the bar|barians who had
taken arms; and to &s;oothe, as it were, tho&s;e glimmerings of revolt and
inno|vation, by prudent re&s;erve, complacency and in|&s;inuations, in order to
conciliate their affections. However, Alexander would not li&s;ten to the&s;e
timorous coun&s;els, but re&s;olved to &s;ecure and &s;upport his affairs, by
boldne&s;s and magnani|mity; <PB N="139" REF="141"> firmly per&s;uaded, that
&s;hould he relax in any point at fir&s;t, all his neighbours would fall upon
him; and that were he to endeavour to compromi&s;e matters, he &s;hould be
obliged to give up all Philip's conque&s;ts, and by that means confine his
dominions to the narrow li|mits of Macedon. He therefore made all po&s;|&s;ible
ha&s;te to check the arms of the barbarians, by marching his troops to the
banks of the Danube, which he cro&s;&s;ed in one night. He defeated the king of
the Triballi in a great battle; made the Getae fly at his approach; &s;ubdued
&s;everal barbarous nations, &s;ome by the terror of his name, and others by
force of arms; and notwith&s;tanding the arrogant an&s;wers of their
amba&s;&s;adors, he taught them to dread a danger, which they found but too
well prepared to overwhelm them.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Alexander was thus employed at a di&s;tance again&s;t the
barbarians, all the cities of Greece, who were animated more particularly by
Demo&s;thenes, formed a powerful alliance again&s;t him. A fal&s;e report which
prevailed of his death, in&s;pired the Thebans with a boldne&s;s that proved
their ruin. They cut to pieces part of the Macedonian garri&s;on in their
citadel. Demo&s;thenes, on the other &s;ide, was every day haranguing the
people; and fired <PB N="140" REF="142"> with contempt for Alexander, whom he
called a child and a hair-brained boy, he a&s;&s;ured the Athenians, with a
deci&s;ive tone of voice, that they had nothing to fear from the new king of
Macedon, who did not dare to &s;tir out of his kingdom, but would think
him&s;elf va&s;tly happy could he &s;it peaceably on his throne. At the &s;ame
time he wrote letters upon letters to Attalus, one of Philip's lieutenants in
A&s;ia Minor, to excite him to rebel. This Attalus was uncle to Cleopatra,
Philip's &s;econd wife, and was very much di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to
De|mo&s;thenes's propo&s;als. Neverthele&s;s, as Alex|ander was grown very
di&s;fident of him, for which he knew there was but too much rea&s;on, he
therefore, to eradicate from his mind all the &s;u&s;picions he might
entertain, and the better to &s;creen his de&s;igns, &s;ent all Demo&s;thenes's
letters to that prince: but Alexander &s;aw through all his arti&s;ices, and
thereupon ordered Hecataeus, one of his commanders, whom he had &s;ent into
A&s;ia for that purpo&s;e, to have him a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, which was executed
accordingly. Attalus's death re&s;tored tranquillity to the army, and entirely
de&s;troyed the &s;eeds of di&s;cord and re|bellion.</P>
<P>The object which &s;eized Alexander's earlie&s;t ambition, was the
conque&s;t of Per&s;ia; and he <PB N="141" REF="143"> now expected that he
would have lei&s;ure and opportunity to prepare for &s;o great an enter|prize:
but he was &s;oon called to a new under|taking; the Athenians, Thebans and
Lacede|monians united again&s;t him; hoping, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
Per&s;ia, to recover their former freedom. In order to per&s;uade the Greeks to
this, Demo&s;thenes made u&s;e of a device, which had more cunning in it than
wi&s;dom. He cau&s;ed it to be reported that Alexander was &s;lain in a battle
again&s;t the Triballi; and he produced a man to the a&s;&s;embly, who ventured
to affirm, that he was pre&s;ent, and wounded, when his general was &s;lain.
The&s;e fal&s;e reports, which &s;erve for a day, are but bad policy; like a
fal&s;e alarm in battle, the people may &s;ometimes be mocked by them; but in
the end, the &s;ucce&s;s will prove as ridiculous as the invention; for as
tho&s;e that find them&s;elves at one time abu&s;ed by &s;uch, at other times
neglect the real call of truth, by being &s;ummoned without occa&s;ion, they
fatally de&s;pi&s;e the hour of danger. This unfortunate ob&s;tacle obliged
Alexander to turn his &s;word from the Per&s;ians again&s;t the Greeks, of
who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had but ju&s;t before a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Expedition and activity were the character|i&s;tics of this
monarch's conduct; he led his <PB N="142" REF="144"> army again&s;t the Greeks
with &s;o much celerity, that his appearance before them gave the fir&s;t news
of his preparation. He appeared &s;o &s;ud|denly in Boeotia, that the Thebans
could &s;carce believe their eyes; and being come before their walls, was
willing to give them time to repent; and only demanded to have Phoenix and
Pro|thules, the two chief ringleaders of the revolt, delivered up to him; and
publi&s;hed, by &s;ound of trumpet, a general pardon to all who &s;hould come
over to him. But the Thebans, by way of in&s;ult, demanded to have Philotas and
An|tipater delivered to them; and invited, by a de|claration, all who were
&s;olicitous for the liberty of Greece, to join with them in its defence.</P>
<P>Alexander finding it impo&s;&s;ible for him to get the better of
their ob&s;tinacy by offers of peace, &s;aw with grief that he &s;hould be
forced to em|ploy his power, and decide the affair by force of arms. A great
battle was thereupon fought, in which the Thebans exerted them&s;elves with a
bravery and ardour much beyond their &s;trength, for the enemy exceeded them
va&s;tly in numbers. But after a long and vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, &s;uch as
&s;urvived of the Macedonian garri&s;on in the citadel, coming down from it,
and charging the Thebans in the rear; being &s;urrounded on all &s;ides, the
greate&s;t part of them were cut to pieces, and the city taken and
plundered.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145"> It would be impo&s;&s;ible for words to
expre&s;s the dreadful calamities which the Thebans &s;uf|fered on this
occa&s;ion. Some Thracians having pulled down the hou&s;e of a virtuous lady of
quality, Timoclea by name, carried off all her goods and trea&s;ures; and their
captain having &s;eized the lady, and &s;atiated his brutal lu&s;t with her,
afterwards enquired whether &s;he had not concealed gold and &s;ilver.
Timoclea, animated by an ardent de&s;ire of revenge, replying, That &s;he had
hid &s;ome, took him with her&s;elf only into her garden, and &s;hewing him a
well, told him, That the in&s;tant &s;he &s;aw the enemy enter the city, &s;he
her&s;elf had thrown into it the mo&s;t precious things in her
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The officer, overjoyed at what he heard, drew near the
well, and &s;toop|ing down to &s;ee its depth, Timoclea, who was behind,
pu&s;hing him with all her &s;trength, threw him in, and afterwards killed him
with great &s;tones, which &s;he heaped upon him. She was in&s;tantly &s;eized
by the Thracians, and being bound in chains, was carried before Alex|ander. The
prince perceived immediately by her mien, that &s;he was a woman of quality,
and great &s;pirit; for &s;he followed tho&s;e brutal wretches with a very
haughty air, and without di&s;covering the lea&s;t fear. Alexander a&s;king her
who &s;he was, Timoclea replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"I am &s;i&s;ter <PB N="144" REF="146"> to
Theagenes, who fought again&s;t Philip for the liberty of Greece, and was
killed in the battle of Chaeronea, where he commanded."</Q> The prince,
admiring her generous an&s;wer, and &s;till more the action that &s;he had
done, gave orders that &s;he &s;hould have leave to retire wherever &s;he
plea&s;ed with her children.</P>
<P>Alexander then debated in council how to act with regard to Thebes.
The Phocians, and the people of Plataea, The&s;piae, and Orchomenus, who were
all in alliance with Alexander, and had &s;hared in his victory, repre&s;ented
to him the cruel treatment they had met with from the Thebans, who al&s;o had
de&s;troyed their &s;e|veral cities, and reproached them with the zeal which
they had always di&s;covered in favour of the Per&s;ians again&s;t the Greeks,
who held them in the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation; the proof of which was, the oath
they had all taken to de&s;troy Thebes, after they &s;hould have vanqui&s;hed
the Per&s;ians.</P>
<P>Cleades, one of the pri&s;oners, being permitted to &s;peak,
endeavoured to excu&s;e in &s;ome mea|&s;ure the revolt of the Thebans; a fault
which in his opinion &s;hould be imputed to a ra&s;h and credulous imprudence,
rather than to depravity of will and declared perfidy. He remon&s;trated, that
his countrymen, upon a fal&s;e report of <PB N="145" REF="147"> Alexander's
death, had indeed too ra&s;hly broke into rebellion, not again&s;t the king,
but again&s;t his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; that what crimes &s;oever they might have
committed, they had been pu|ni&s;hed for them with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, by
the dreadful calamity which had befallen their city; that there now remained in
it none but women, children and old men, from whom they had nothing to fear;
and who were &s;o much the greater objects of compa&s;&s;ion, as they had been
no ways concerned in the revolt. He concluded with reminding Alex|ander, that
Thebes, which had given birth to &s;o many gods and heroes, &s;everal of whom
were that king's ance&s;tors, had al&s;o been the &s;eat of his father Philip's
ri&s;ing glory, and like a &s;econd native country to him.</P>
<P>The&s;e motives which Cleades urged, were very &s;trong and
powerful; neverthele&s;s, the anger of the conqueror prevailed, and the city
was de&s;troyed. However, he &s;et at liberty the prie&s;ts; all &s;uch as had
right of ho&s;pitality with the Macedonians; the de&s;cendants of Pindar, the
famous poet, who had done &s;o much honour to Greece; and &s;uch as had
oppo&s;ed the revolt. But all the re&s;t, in number about thirty thou&s;and, he
&s;old; and upwards of &s;ix thou&s;and had been killed in battle. The
Athe|nians <PB N="146" REF="148"> were &s;o &s;en&s;ibly afflicted at the &s;ad
di&s;|a&s;ter which had befallen Thebes, that being about to &s;olemnize the
fe&s;tival of the great my&s;teries, they &s;u&s;pended them upon account of
their extreme grief; and received, with the greate&s;t humanity, all tho&s;e
who had fled from the battle, and the plunder of Thebes, and made Athens their
a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>Alexander's &s;o &s;udden arrival in Greece, had very much abated
the haughtine&s;s of the Athe|nians, and extingui&s;hed Demo&s;thenes's
vehe|mence and fire; but the ruin of Thebes, which was &s;till more &s;udden,
threw them into the ut|mo&s;t con&s;ternation. They therefore had recour&s;e to
intreaties, and &s;ent a deputation to Alexander to implore his clemency;
Demo&s;thenes was among them; but he was no &s;ooner arrived at Mount Cytheron,
than dreading the anger of that prince, he quitted the emba&s;&s;y, and
re|turned home.</P>
<P>Immediately Alexander &s;ent to Athens, re|quiring the citizens to
deliver up to him ten orators, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the chief
in&s;truments in forming the league which Philip his father had defeated at
Chaeronea. It was on this occa&s;ion that Demo&s;thenes related to the people
the fable of the wolves and dogs; in which it is &s;uppo&s;ed, That the wolves
one day <PB N="147" REF="149"> told the &s;heep, that in ca&s;e they de&s;ired
to be at peace with them, they mu&s;t deliver up to them the dogs who were
their guard. The application was ea&s;y and natural; e&s;pecially with
re&s;pect to the orators, who were ju&s;tly compared to dogs, who&s;e duty it
was to watch, to bark, and to fight, in order to &s;ave the lives of the
flock.</P>
<P>In this afflicting dilemma of the Athenians, who could not prevvail
with them&s;elves to de|liver up their orators to certain death, though they
had no other way to &s;ave their city, De|mades, whom Alexander had honoured
with his friend&s;hip, offered to undertake the emba&s;&s;y alone, and
intercede for them. The king, whether he had &s;atiated his revenge, or
en|deavoured to blot out, if po&s;&s;ible, by &s;ome act of clemency, the
barbarous action he had ju&s;t before committed; or rather to remove the
&s;e|veral ob&s;tacles which might retard the execu|tion of his grand de&s;ign,
and by that means not leave, during his ab&s;ence, the lea&s;t pre|tence for
murmurs, waved his demand with regard to the delivery of the orators, and was
pacified by their &s;ending Caridemus into ba|ni&s;hment; who being a native of
Oraea, had been pre&s;ented by the Athenians with his freedom, for the
&s;ervices he had done the <PB N="148" REF="150"> republic. He was &s;on-in-law
to Cher&s;obleptus, king of Thrace; had learned the art of war under
Iphicrates; and had him&s;elf frequently commanded the Athenian armies. To
avoid the pur&s;uit of Alexander, he took refuge with the king of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>As for the Athenians, he not only forgave them the &s;everal
injuries he pretended to have received, but expre&s;&s;ed a particular regard
for them, exhorting them to apply them&s;elves vigorou&s;ly to public affairs,
and to keep a watchful eye over the &s;everal tran&s;actions which might
happen; becau&s;e, in ca&s;e of his death, their city was to give laws to the
re&s;t of Greece. Hi&s;torians relate, that many years after this expedition,
he was &s;eized with deep remor&s;e for the calamity he had brought upon the
Thebans; and that this made him behave with much greater humanity towards many
other nations.</P>
<P>So dreadful an example of &s;everity towards &s;o powerful a city as
Thebes, &s;pread the terror of his arms through all Greece, and made all things
give way before him. He &s;ummoned at Corinth, the a&s;&s;embly of the
&s;everal &s;tates and free cities of Greece, to obtain from them the &s;ame
&s;upreme command again&s;t the Per|&s;ians, <PB N="149" REF="151"> which had
been granted his father a little before his death. No a&s;&s;embly ever debated
upon a more important &s;ubject. It was the we&s;tern world deliberating upon
the ruin of the ea&s;t; and the methods for executing a re|venge which had been
&s;u&s;pended more than an age. The a&s;&s;embly held at this time, gave ri&s;e
to events, the relation of which appear a&s;toni&s;h|ing, and almo&s;t
incredible; and to revolutions which contributed to change the di&s;po&s;ition
of mo&s;t things in the political world.</P>
<P>To form &s;uch a de&s;ign, required a prince bold, enterpri&s;ing,
and experienced in war; one of great views, who, having acquired a great name
by his exploits, was not to be intimidated by dangers, nor checked by
ob|&s;tacles; but, above all, a monarch, who had a &s;upreme authority over all
the &s;tates of Greece, none of which, &s;ingly, was powerful enough to make
&s;o arduous an attempt; and which required, in order for their acting in
concert, to be &s;ubject to one chief, who might give motion to the &s;everal
parts of that great body, by making them all concur to the &s;ame end. Such a
prince was Alexander: it was not difficult for him to rekindle in the minds of
the people their ancient hatred of the Per&s;ians. <PB N="150" REF="152"> their
perpetual and irreconcileable enemies; who&s;e de&s;truction they had more than
once &s;wore, and whom they had determined to ex|tirpate, in ca&s;e an
opportunity &s;hould pre&s;ent it&s;elf for that purpo&s;e; a hatred which the
in|te&s;tine feuds of the Greeks might indeed have &s;u&s;pended, but could
never extingui&s;h. The im|mortal retreat of the ten thou&s;and Greeks,
notwith&s;tanding the vigorous oppo&s;ition of the prodigious army of the
Per&s;ians, &s;hewed plainly what might be expected from an army com|po&s;ed of
the flower of the forces of all the cities of Greece, and tho&s;e of Macedon,
commanded by generals and officers formed under Philip; and to &s;ay all in a
word, led by Alexander. The deliberations of the a&s;&s;embly were therefore
very &s;hort; and that prince was unanimou&s;ly appointed generali&s;&s;imo
again&s;t the Per&s;ians.</P>
<P>Immediately a great number of officers, and governors of cities,
with many philo&s;ophers, waited upon Alexander, to congratulate him upon his
election. He flattered him&s;elf, that Diogenes of Synope, who was then at
Corinth, would al&s;o come like the re&s;t, and pay his com|pliments. This
philo&s;opher, who entertained a very mean idea of grandeur, thought it
improper to congratulate men ju&s;t upon their exaltation; 
<PB N="151" REF="153"> but that mankind ought to wait till tho&s;e per|&s;ons
&s;hould perform actions worthy of their high &s;tations. Diogenes therefore
&s;till con|tinued at home; upon which Alexander, at|tended by all his
courtiers, made him a vi&s;it. The philo&s;opher was at that time lying down in
the &s;un; but &s;eeing &s;o great a crowd of people advancing towards him, he
&s;at up, and fixed his eyes on Alexander. This prince, &s;urprized to be|hold
&s;o famous a philo&s;opher reduced to &s;uch ex|treme poverty, after
&s;aluting him in the kinde&s;t manner, a&s;ked, Whether he wanted any thing?
Diogenes replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, that you would &s;tand a little out of my
&s;un-&s;hine."</Q> This an&s;wer rai&s;ed the contempt and indignation of all
the courtiers; but the monarch, &s;truck with the philo&s;opher's greatne&s;s
of &s;oul, 
<Q REND="inline">"Were I not Alexander," &s;ays he, "I would be
Diogenes."</Q> In a word, all or nothing pre&s;ents us with the true image of
Alexander and Diogenes. How great and powerful &s;oever that prince might think
him|&s;elf, he could not deny him&s;elf, on this occa&s;ion, inferior to a man
to whom he could give, and from whom he could take nothing.</P>
<P>Alexander, before he &s;et out for A&s;ia, was de|termined to
con&s;ult the oracle of Apollo. He therefore went to Delphos, where he happened
<PB N="152" REF="154"> to arrive in tho&s;e days which are called unlucky; a
&s;ea&s;on in which people were forbid con&s;ulting the oracle: and accordingly
the prie&s;te&s;s refu&s;ed to go to the temple. But Alexander, who could not
bear any contradiction to his will, took her forcibly by the arm, and as he was
leading her to the temple, &s;he cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, thou art irre&s;i&s;tible."</Q> This was
all he de&s;ired; and catching hold of the&s;e words, which he con|&s;idered as
&s;poke by the oracle, he &s;et out for Macedonia, in order to make
preparations for his great expedition.</P>
<P>Alexander being arrived in his kingdom, held a council with the
chief officers of his army, and the nobles of his court, on the expedition he
meditated again&s;t Per&s;ia, and the mea&s;ures he &s;hould take in order to
&s;ucceed in it. The whole a&s;&s;embly were unanimous, except in one article.
Antipater and Parmenio were of opi|nion, that the king, before he engaged in an
enterprize which would nece&s;&s;arily be a long one, ought to make choice of a
con&s;ort, in order to &s;ecure him&s;elf a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his throne. But
Alexander, who was of a violent fiery tem|per, did not approve of this advice;
and believ|ed that after he had been nominated generali&s;|&s;imo of the
Greeks, and that his father had left <PB N="153" REF="155"> him an invincible
army, it would be a &s;hame for him to lo&s;e his time in &s;olemnizing his
nup|tials, and waiting for the fruits of it; for which rea&s;on he determined
to &s;et out immediately.</P>
<P>Accordingly he offered up very &s;plendid &s;a|crifices to the gods,
and cau&s;ed to be celebrated at Dia, a city of Macedon, &s;cenical games that
had been in&s;tituted by one of his ance&s;tors in honour of Jupiter and the
Mu&s;es. This fe&s;tival continued nine days, agreeable to the number of
tho&s;e godde&s;&s;es. He had a tent rai&s;ed large enough to hold an hundred
tables, on which con&s;equently nine hundred covers might be laid. To this
fea&s;t, the &s;everal princes of his family, all the amba&s;&s;adors,
ge|nerals and officers were invited.</P>
<P>Before he &s;et out upon his great expedition, he &s;ettled the
affairs of Macedon, over which he appointed Antipater as viceroy, with twelve
thou&s;and foot, and near the &s;ame number of hor&s;e. He al&s;o enquired into
the dome&s;tic affairs of his friends, giving to one an e&s;tate in land, to
another a village, to a third the revenues of a town, to a fourth the toll of
an harbour. As all the revenues of his deme&s;nes were already employed, and
exhau&s;ted by his donations, Perdicas &s;aid to him, 
<Q REND="inline">"My lord, what is it <PB N="154" REF="156"> you
re&s;erve for your&s;elf?"</Q> Alexander replied, Hope: upon which Perdicas
&s;aid, 
<Q REND="inline">"the &s;ame hope ought therefore to &s;atisfy
us;"</Q> and &s;o refu&s;ed very generou&s;ly to accept of what the king had
appointed him.</P>
<P>After having completely &s;ettled his affairs in Macedonia, and
u&s;ed all the precautions imaginable to prevent any troubles from ari&s;ing in
it during his ab&s;ence, he &s;et out for A&s;ia in the beginning of the
Spring. His army con|&s;i&s;ted of little more than thirty thou&s;and foot, and
four or five thou&s;and hor&s;e; but then they were all brave men, well
di&s;ciplined, and enu|red to fatigues. They had made &s;everal cam|paigns
under Philip, and were each of them in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity capable of
commanding: mo&s;t of the officers were near three&s;core years of age, and the
common men fifty; and when they were either a&s;&s;embled, or drawn up at the
head of a camp, they had the air of a venerable &s;enate. Parmenio commanded
the infantry, Philotas his &s;on, had eighteen hundred hor&s;e under him; and
Callas, the &s;on of Harpalus, the &s;ame number of The&s;&s;alian cavalry. The
re&s;t of the hor&s;e were compo&s;ed of natives of the &s;everal &s;tates of
Greece, and amounted to &s;ix hundred, had their particular commander. The 
<PB N="155" REF="157"> Thracians and Poeonians, who were always in front, were
headed by Ca&s;&s;ander. Alexander began his march along the lake Cercinum,
to|wards Amphipolis; cro&s;&s;ed the river Strymon, near its mouth; afterwards
the Hebrus, and arrived at Se&s;tos after twenty days march. He then commanded
Parmenio to cro&s;s over from Se&s;tos to Abydos, with all the hor&s;e, and
part of the foot; which he accordingly did with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an
hundred and three&s;core gallies, and &s;everal flat-bottomed ve&s;&s;els;
while he him&s;elf cro&s;&s;ed over the Helle&s;pont, &s;teering his gally with
his own hands: and when he ar|rived near the &s;hore, as if to take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the continent, he leaped from his &s;hip in com|plete
armour, and te&s;tified many tran&s;ports of joy.</P>
<P>This confidence &s;oon began to diffu&s;e it&s;elf over all the
re&s;t of his army; it in&s;pired his &s;oldiers with &s;o much courage and
&s;ecurity, that they fancied them&s;elves marching not to a precarious war,
but a certain victory.</P>
<P>Being arrived at the city of Lamp&s;acus, which he was determined to
de&s;troy, in order to puni&s;h the rebellion of its inhabitants, Anaxi|menes,
a native of that place, came to him. This man, who was a famous hi&s;torian,
had been very intimate with Philip his father; and Alex|ander 
<PB N="156" REF="158"> him&s;elf had a great e&s;teem for him, having been his
pupil. The king &s;u&s;pecting the bu&s;i|ne&s;s he came upon, to be
before-hand with him, &s;wore, in expre&s;s terms, that he would never grant
his reque&s;t. The favour I have to de&s;ire of you, &s;ays Anaximenes, is,
that you would de&s;troy Lamp&s;acus. By this witty eva&s;ion, the hi&s;torian
&s;aved his country.</P>
<P>From thence Alexander went to Troy, where he paid great honours to
the &s;hade of Achilles, and cau&s;ed games to be celebrated round his tomb. He
admired and envied the felicity of that Grecian hero, in having found during
life a faithful friend in Patroclus; and after death a noble panegyri&s;t in
Homer.</P>
<P>When the news of Alexander's landing in A&s;ia was brought to
Darius, he te&s;tified the utmo&s;t contempt for the Macedonian army, and
indignation at the pre&s;umption of their generals. In a letter which he wrote,
he repre|hended his audacious in&s;olence, and gave or|ders to his various
governors, in the different parts of his dominions, that if they took
Alex|ander alive, to whip him with rods, make pri|&s;oners of his whole army,
and &s;end them as &s;laves to one of the mo&s;t de&s;erted parts of his
dominions. Thus confiding in the glittering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <PB N="157" REF="159"> but barbarous multitude which he commanded,
he di&s;po&s;ed of the enemy as already vanqui&s;h|ed: but confidence goes but
a &s;hort part of the road to &s;ucce&s;s. The great numbers which he had
gathered, only brought unwiedly &s;plendor into the field, and in&s;tead of
procuring him &s;e|curity, increa&s;ed his embarra&s;&s;ments.</P>
<P>Alexander, being at length arrived on the banks of the Grannicus, a
river of Phrygia, there fir&s;t found the Per&s;ians di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;pute
his pa&s;&s;age. The Per&s;ian &s;atrap taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the higher
banks, at the head of an army of one hundred thou&s;and foot, and upwards of
ten thou&s;and hor&s;e, &s;eemed to promi&s;e them&s;elves victory. Memnon, who
was a Rhodian, and commanded under Darius all the coa&s;t of A&s;ia, had
advi&s;ed the generals not to venture a battle, but to lay wa&s;te the plains,
and even the cities, thereby to &s;tarve Alexander's army, and oblige him to
return back into Europe. Memnon was the be&s;t of all Darius's generals, and
had been the principal agent in his victories. It is not ea&s;ily to determine
what we ought to ad|mire mo&s;t in him; whether his great wi&s;dom in council,
his courage and capacity in the field, or his zeal and attachment to his
&s;overeign. The council he gave on this occa&s;ion was ex|cellent, 
<PB N="158" REF="160"> when we con&s;ider that his enemy was fiery and
impetuous; had neither town, maga|zine, or place of retreat; that he was
entering a country to which he was ab&s;olutely a &s;tranger, and inhabited by
enemies; that delays alone would weaken and ruin him; and that his only hopes
lay in giving battle immediately. But Arfites a Phrygian &s;atrap oppo&s;ed the
opinion of Memnon, and prote&s;ted he would never &s;uffer the Grecians to make
&s;uch havock in the territories he governed. This ill council pre|vailed over
that of the Rhodian, whom the Per&s;ians to their great prejudice &s;u&s;pected
of a de&s;ign to protract the war, and by that means of making him&s;elf
nece&s;&s;ary to Darius.</P>
<P>Alexander in the mean time marched on at the head of his heavy armed
infantry, drawn up in two lines, with the cavalry in the wings, and the baggage
following in the rear. Being ar|rived upon the banks of the Grannicus,
Par|menio advi&s;ed him to encamp there in battle array, in order that his
forces might have time to re&s;t them&s;elves, and not to pa&s;s the river till
very early next morning, becau&s;e the enemy would then be le&s;s able to
prevent him: He added, that it would be too dangerous to at|tempt cro&s;&s;ing
a river in &s;ight of an enemy, e&s;|pecially <PB N="159" REF="161"> as that
before them was deep, and its banks very craggy; &s;o that the Per&s;ian
cavalry, who waited their coming in battle array, on the other &s;ide, might
ea&s;ily defeat them before they were drawn up: That be&s;ides the lo&s;s which
would be &s;u&s;tained on this occa&s;ion, this enterprize, in ca&s;e it
&s;hould prove un&s;ucce&s;sful, would be of dangerous con&s;equence to their
future affairs; the fame and glory of arms de|pending on the fir&s;t
actions.</P>
<P>However the&s;e rea&s;ons were not able to make the lea&s;t
impre&s;&s;ion on Alexander, who declar|ed that it would be a &s;hame &s;hould
he, after cro&s;&s;ing the Helle&s;pont, &s;uffer his progre&s;s to be retarded
by a rivulet; for &s;o he called the Grannicus out of contempt; that they ought
to take advantage of the terror which the &s;uddenne&s;s of his arrival, and
the boldne&s;s of his attempt, had &s;pread among&s;t the Per&s;ians; and
an&s;wer the high opinion the world conceived of his courage, and the valour of
the Macedo|nians. The enemy's hor&s;e which was very nu|merous, lined the whole
&s;hore, and formed a large front, in order to oppo&s;e Alexander where|ever he
&s;hould endeavour to pa&s;s; and the foot, which con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of
Greeks in Da|rius's &s;ervice, was po&s;ted behind upon an ea&s;y a&s;cent.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="162"> The two armies continued a long time in
&s;ight of each other, on the banks of the river, as if dreading the event. The
Per&s;ians waited till the Macedonians &s;hould enter the river, in order to
charge them to advantage upon their landing, and the latter &s;eemed to be
making choice of a place proper for cro&s;&s;ing, and to &s;ur|vey the
countenance of their enemies. Upon this, Alexander ordered his hor&s;e to be
brought, commanded the noblemen of the court to follow him, and behave
gallantly. He him&s;elf com|manded the right wing, and Parmenio the left. The
king fir&s;t cau&s;ed a &s;trong detachment to march into the river, him&s;elf
following it with the re&s;t of the forces. He made Parmenio ad|vance
afterwards with the left wing: he him|&s;elf led on the right wing into the
river, fol|lowed by the re&s;t of the troops; the trumpets &s;ounding, and the
whole army rai&s;ing cries of joy.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians &s;eeing this detachment advance forward, began to
let fly their arrows, and march to a place where the declivity was not &s;o
great, in order to keep the Macedonians from landing. But now the hor&s;e
engaged with great fury, one part endeavouring to land, and the other
&s;triving to prevent them. The Mace|donians, who&s;e cavalry was va&s;tly
inferior in <PB N="161" REF="163"> number, be&s;ides the advantage of the
ground, were wounded with the darts, that were &s;hot from the eminence; not to
mention that the flower of the Per&s;ian hor&s;e were drawn toge|ther in this
place, and that Memnon in con|cert with his &s;ons, commanded there. The
Macedonians therefore at fir&s;t gave ground, after having lo&s;t the fir&s;t
ranks which made a vigorous defence. Alexander, who had follow|ed them clo&s;e,
and reinforced them with his be&s;t troops, headed them him&s;elf, animated
them by his pre&s;ence, pu&s;hed the Per&s;ians, and routed them; upon which
the whole army fol|lowed after, cro&s;s'd the river, and attacked the enemy on
all &s;ides.</P>
<P>Alexander fir&s;t charged the thicke&s;t part of the enemy's
hor&s;e, in which the generals fought. He him&s;elf was particularly
con&s;picuous by his &s;hield, and the plume of feathers that over-&s;hadowed
his helmet, on the two &s;ides of which, there ro&s;e two wings, as it were, of
a great length, and &s;o va&s;tly white, that they dazzled the eyes of the
beholder. The charge was very furious about his per&s;on, and though only the
hor&s;e engaged, they fought like foot, man to man, without giving way on
either &s;ide; every one &s;triving to repul&s;e his adver&s;ary, and gain
ground of him. Spithrobates, lieutenant-governor <PB N="162" REF="164"> of
Ionia, and &s;on-in-law to Darius, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf above the re&s;t
of the gene|rals by his &s;uperior bravery. Being &s;urrounded by forty
Per&s;ian lords, all of them his relations of experienced valour, and who never
moved from his &s;ide, he carried terror where-ever he went. Alexander
ob&s;erving in how gallant a manner he &s;ignalized him&s;elf, clapt &s;purs to
his hor&s;e, and advanced towards him. Immedi|ately they engaged, and each
having thrown a javelin, wounded the other &s;lightly. Spithro|bates falls
furiou&s;ly &s;word in hand upon Alex|ander, who being prepared for him,
thru&s;ts his pike into his face, and laid him dead at his feet. At that very
moment, Ra&s;aces, brother to that nobleman, charging him on the &s;ide, gave
him &s;o furious a blow on the head with his battle-axe that he beat off his
plume, but went no deeper than the hair. As he was going to repeat his blow on
the head, which now appear|ed through his fractured helmet, Clitus cut off
Ra&s;aces's hand with one &s;troke of his &s;cimetar, and by that means &s;aved
his &s;overeign's life. The danger to which Alexander had been ex|po&s;ed,
greatly animated the courage of his &s;oldiers, who now performed wonders. The
Per&s;ians in the center of the hor&s;e, upon whom the light-armed troops, who
had been po&s;ted <PB N="163" REF="165"> in the intervals of the hor&s;e,
poured a perpe|tual di&s;charge of darts, being unable to &s;u&s;tain any
longer the attack of the Macedonians, who &s;truck them all in the face, the
two wings were immediately broke, and put to flight. Alex|ander did not
pur&s;ue them long, but turned about immediately to charge the foot.</P>
<P>The&s;e at fir&s;t &s;tood their ground, but when they &s;aw
them&s;elves attacked at the &s;ame time by the cavalry, and the Macedonian
phalanx which had cro&s;&s;ed the river, and that the bat|talions were now
engaged, tho&s;e of the Per&s;ians did not make either a long or a vigorous
re&s;i&s;t|ance, and were &s;oon put to flight; the Grecian infantry in
Darius's &s;ervice excepted. This body of foot retiring to a hill, demanded a
pro|mi&s;e from Alexander to let them march away unmole&s;ted; but following
the dictates of his wrath, rather than tho&s;e of rea&s;on, he ru&s;hed into
the mid&s;t of this body of foot, and pre|&s;ently lo&s;t his hor&s;e, (not
Bucephalus) who was killed with the thru&s;t of a &s;word. The battle was &s;o
hot round him, that mo&s;t of the Mace|donians, who lo&s;t their lives on this
occa&s;ion, fell here; for they fought again&s;t a body of men, who were well
di&s;ciplined, had been inured to war, and fought in de&s;pair. They 
<PB N="164" REF="166"> were all cut to pieces, two thou&s;and excepted, who
were taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>A great number of the Per&s;ian commanders lay dead on the &s;pot.
Ari&s;tes fled into Phrygia, where it is &s;aid he laid violent hands on
him|&s;elf, for having been the cau&s;e that the battle was fought. Twenty
thou&s;and foot, and two thou&s;and five hundred hor&s;e, were killed in this
engagement, on the &s;ide of the barbarians; and of the Macedonians,
twenty-five of the royal hor&s;e were killed at the fir&s;t attack. Alexander
ordered Ly&s;ippus to make their &s;ta|tues in bra&s;s, all of which were &s;et
up in a city of Macedon, called Dia, from whence they were many years after
carried to Rome, by Metellus. About three&s;core of the other hor&s;e were
killed, and near thirty foot, who, the next day, were all laid with their arms
and equipage in one grave; and the king granted an exemption to their fathers
and children, from every kind of tribute and &s;ervice.</P>
<P>He al&s;o took the utmo&s;t care of the wounded, vi&s;ited them, and
&s;aw their wounds dre&s;&s;ed. He enquired very particularly into their
adven|tures, and permitted every one of them to re|late his actions in the
battle, and boa&s;t his bra|very. He al&s;o granted the rites of &s;epulture to
<PB N="165" REF="167"> the principal Per&s;ians, and did not even refu&s;e it
to &s;uch Greeks as died in the Per&s;ian &s;ervice; but all tho&s;e whom he
took pri&s;oners, he laid in chains, and &s;ent to work as &s;laves in
Macedonia, for having fought under the barbarian &s;tandard again&s;t their
country, contrary to the expre&s;s prohibition made by Greece upon that
head.</P>
<P>Alexander made it his duty and plea&s;ure to &s;hare the honour of
his victory with the Greeks; and &s;ent particularly to the Athenians, three
hundred &s;hields, being part of the plunder taken from the enemy, and cau&s;ed
the glorious in|&s;cription following to be in&s;cribed on the re&s;t of the
&s;poils: 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Alexander &s;on of Philip, with the Greeks,
(the Lacedemonians excepted), gain|ed the&s;e &s;poils from the barbarians, who
inhabit A&s;ia.</HI>"</Q> The greate&s;t part of the gold and &s;ilver plate,
the purple carpets, and other furniture of the Per&s;ian luxury, he &s;ent to
his mother.</P>
<P>This victory not only impre&s;&s;ed the Per&s;ians with
con&s;ternation, but &s;erved to excite the ardour of the invading army. The
Per&s;ians perceiving that the Greeks were not able to overcome them, though
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of manife&s;t ad|vantages, &s;uppo&s;ed that they never could
be able to face them upon equal terms; and thus, from the fir&s;t mi&s;chance,
they gave up all hopes <PB N="166" REF="168"> of &s;ucceeding by valour.
Indeed, in all inva|&s;ions where the nations invaded have been once beaten,
with great advantages of place on their &s;ide, &s;uch as defen&s;ive rivers,
&s;traits, and mountains; they &s;oon begin to per&s;uade them|&s;elves, that
upon equal terms, &s;uch an enemy mu&s;t be irre&s;i&s;tible. It is the opinion
of Ma|chiavel, that he who re&s;olves to defend a pa&s;&s;age, &s;hould do it
with his able&s;t forces; for few regions of any circuit are &s;o well defended
by nature, that armies of &s;uch force as may be thought &s;ufficient to
conquer them, cannot break through the natural difficulties of the en|trance;
one pa&s;&s;age or other is commonly left unguarded; and &s;ome place weakly
defended, will be the cau&s;e of a fatal triumph to the in|vaders. How often
have the Alps given way to armies breaking into Italy? and tho' they pro|duced
dreadful difficulties and dangers among tho&s;e that &s;caled them, yet they
were never found to give &s;ecurity to tho&s;e that lay behind. It was
therefore wi&s;ely done of Alexander to pa&s;s the river in the face of the
enemy, with|out marching higher to &s;eek an ea&s;ier pa&s;&s;age, or labouring
to convey his men over it by &s;ome &s;a&s;er method. Having beaten the enemy
upon their own terms, he no le&s;s de&s;troyed their re|putation than their
&s;trength, leaving the wretch|ed <PB N="167" REF="169"> &s;ubjects of &s;uch a
&s;tate, no hopes of &s;uccour from &s;uch unable protectors.</P>
<P>Soon after the battle of Grannicus, he recover|ed Sardis from the
enemy, which was in a man|ner the bulwark of the Barbarian empire on the &s;ide
next the &s;ea; he took the inhabitants under his protection, received their
nobles with the utmo&s;t conde&s;cen&s;ion, and permitted them to be governed
by their own laws and maxims, ob&s;erving to his friends around him, That
&s;uch as lay the foundations of a new dominion, &s;hould always endeavour to
have the fame of being merciful. Four days after, he arrived at Ephe&s;us,
carrying with him tho&s;e who had been bani&s;hed from thence for being his
adhe|rents, and re&s;tored its popular form of govern|ment. He a&s;&s;igned to
the Temple of Diana, the tributes which were paid to the kings of Per&s;ia.
Before he left Ephe&s;us, the deputies of the cities of Trallis and Magne&s;ia
waited upon him with the keys of tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>He afterwards marched to Miletus; which city, flattered with the
hopes of a &s;udden and powerful &s;upport, &s;hut their gates again&s;t him;
and indeed the Per&s;ian fleet, which was very con&s;iderable, made a &s;hew as
if it would &s;uccour that city; but after having made &s;everal fruit|le&s;s
attempts to engage that of the enemy, it <PB N="168" REF="170"> was forced to
&s;ail way. Memnon had &s;hut him&s;elf up in this fortre&s;s, with a great
number of his &s;oldiers who had e&s;caped from the battle, and was determined
to make a good defence. Alexander, who would not lo&s;e a moment's time,
attacked it, and planted &s;caling-ladders on all &s;ides. The &s;calade was
carried on with great vigour, and oppo&s;ed with no le&s;s intrepidity, though
Alexander &s;ent fre&s;h troops to relieve each other without the lea&s;t
intermi&s;&s;ion; and this la&s;ted &s;everal days. At la&s;t finding his
&s;oldiers were every where repul&s;ed, and that the city was provided with
every thing for a long &s;iege, he planted all his machines again&s;t it, made
a great number of breaches, and whenever the&s;e were attacked, a new &s;calade
was attempted. The be&s;ieged, after &s;u&s;taining all the&s;e efforts with
prodigious bravery, capitulat|ed to prevent being taken by &s;torm. Alexander
treated the Mile&s;ians with the utmo&s;t humanity, but &s;old all the
foreigners who were found in it.</P>
<P>After po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of Miletus, he marched into
Caria, in order to lay &s;iege to Hali|carna&s;&s;us. This city was of
prodigious difficult acce&s;s from its happy &s;ituation, and had been
&s;trongly fortified. Be&s;ides Memnon, the able&s;t as well as the mo&s;t
valiant of all Darius's com|manders, had got into it with a body of choice 
<PB N="169" REF="171"> &s;oldiers, with a de&s;ign to &s;ignalize his courage
and fidelity for his &s;overeign. He accordingly made a very noble defence, in
which he was &s;econded by Ephialtes, another general of great merit. Whatever
could be expected from the mo&s;t intrepid bravery and the mo&s;t con&s;ummate
knowledge in the &s;cience of war, was con&s;picuous on both &s;ides on this
occa&s;ion. Memnon finding it impo&s;&s;ible for him to hold out any longer,
was forced to abandon the city. As the &s;ea was open to him, after having put
a &s;trong garri&s;on into the citadel, which was well &s;tored with
provi&s;ions, he took with him the &s;urviving inhabitants, with all their
riches, and conveyed them into the i&s;land of Cos, which was not far from
Halicarna&s;&s;us. Alexander did not think proper to be&s;iege the citadel, it
being of little importance after the city was de&s;troyed, which he
demoli&s;hed to the very foundations. He left it after having encompa&s;&s;ed
it with &s;trong walls, and left &s;ome good troops in the country.</P>
<P>Soon after this, he re&s;tored Ada queen of Caria to her kingdom, of
which &s;he had been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome time before; and as a
te&s;|timony of the deep &s;en&s;e &s;he had of the favours received from
Alexander, &s;he &s;ent him every day meats dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite manner, <PB N="170" REF="172"> and the mo&s;t excellent cooks of
every kind. Alexander an&s;wered the queen on this occa&s;ion, That all this
train was of no &s;ervice to him; for that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much
better cooks, whom Leonidas his governor had given him, one of whom prepared
him a good dinner, and an excellent &s;upper, and tho&s;e were Temperance and
Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Several kings of A&s;ia Minor, &s;ubmitted vo|luntarily to
Alexander; Mithridates, king of Pontus, was one of the&s;e, who afterwards
adhered to this prince, and followed him in his expedi|tions. He was &s;on to
Ariobarzanes governor of Phrygia and king of Pontus, of whom mention has been
made el&s;ewhere. He is computed to be the &s;ixteenth king from Artabanus, who
is con&s;idered as the founder of that kingdom, of which he was put in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by Darius, &s;on of Hy&s;ta&s;pes his father. The famous
Mithri|dates, who &s;o long employed the Roman armies, was one of his
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The year en&s;uing, Alexander began the cam|paign very early. He had
debated whether it would be proper for him to march direct|ly again&s;t Darius,
or fir&s;t &s;ubdue the re&s;t of the maritime provinces. The latter opinion
appeared the &s;afe&s;t, &s;ince he thereby would not <PB N="171" REF="173"> be
mole&s;ted by &s;uch nations as he &s;hould leave behind him. This progre&s;s
was a little inter|rupted at fir&s;t. Near Pha&s;elis, a city &s;ituated
between Ly&s;ia and Pamphilia, is a defile along the &s;ea &s;hore, which is
always dry at low water, &s;o that travellers may pa&s;s it at that time; but
when the &s;ea ri&s;es, it is all under water. As it was now winter, Alexander,
whom nothing could daunt, was de&s;irous of pa&s;&s;ing it before the waters
fell. His forces were therefore ob|liged to march a whole day in the water,
which came up to their wa&s;te.</P>
<P>Alexander after having &s;ettled affairs in Cili|cia and Pamphilia,
marched his army to Coelenae, a city of Phrygia watered by the river
Mar|&s;yas, which the fictions of Poets have made &s;o famous. He &s;ummoned
the garri&s;on of the citadel, whither the inhabitants were retired, to
&s;urrender; but the&s;e believing it impregnable, an&s;wered haughtily, That
they would fir&s;t die. However finding the attack carried on with great
vigour, they de&s;ired a truce of &s;ixty days, at the expiration of which,
they promi&s;ed to open their gates, in ca&s;e they were not &s;uccour|ed. And
accordingly, no aid arriving, they &s;urrendered them&s;elves upon the day
fixed.</P>
<P>From thence he marched into Phrygia, the ancient dominion of the
celebrated king Midas; <PB N="172" REF="174"> having taken the capital city, he
was de&s;irous of &s;eeing the famous chariot to which the Gordian knot was
tied. This knot which fa&s;tened the yoke to the beam, was tied with &s;o much
intricacy, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover where the ends begun, or
how they were concealed. According to an ancient tradition of the country, an
ora|cle had foretold that the man who could un|tie it, &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s
the empire of A&s;ia. Alex|ander being firmly per&s;uaded that the oracle was
meant for him, after many fruitle&s;s trials, in|&s;tead of attempting to untie
it in the u&s;ual manner, drew his &s;word and cut it in pieces, crying out,
That that was the only way to un|tie it. The prie&s;t hailed the omen, and
de|clared that Alexander had fulfilled the oracle.</P>
<P>Darius, who now began to be more alarmed than before, u&s;ed all the
art in his power to rai&s;e an army, and encourage his forces: he &s;ent Memnon
into Greece to invade Macedon, in order to make a diver&s;ion of the Grecian
forces; but this general dying upon that ex|pedition, Darius's hopes vani&s;hed
on that quar|ter, and in&s;tead of invading the enemy, he was obliged to
con&s;ult for the protection of his empire at home.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Alexander having le&s;t Gordion, marched into
Paphlogonia and Cap|padocia, <PB N="173" REF="175"> which he &s;ubdued. It was
there he heard of Memnon's death; the news whereof confirmed him in the
re&s;olution he had taken, of marching immediately into the provinces of Upper
A&s;ia. Accordingly he advanced, by ha&s;ty marches, into Cilicia, and arrived
in the country called Cyrus's Camp. From thence there is no more than fifty
&s;tadia (two leagues and a half each) to the pa&s;s of Cilicia, which is a
very narrow &s;trait, through which travellers are obliged to go from
Cappadocia to Tar&s;us. The officer who guarded it in Darius's name, had left
but few &s;oldiers in it; and tho&s;e fled the in&s;tant they heard of the
enemy's arrival. Upon this, Alexander entered the pa&s;s, and after viewing
very attentively the &s;ituation of the place, admired his own good fortune,
and confe&s;&s;ed, He might have been very ea&s;ily &s;topped and defeated
there, merely by the throwing of &s;tones; for not to mention that this pa&s;s
was &s;o narrow, that four men, completely armed, could &s;carcely walk a
brea&s;t in it; the top of the mountain hung over the road, which was not only
&s;trait, but broke in &s;everal places, by the fall of torrents from the
mountains.</P>
<P>Alexander marched his whole army to the city of Tar&s;us, where it
arrived the in&s;tant <PB N="174" REF="176"> the Per&s;ians were &s;etting fire
to that place, to prevent his plundering the great riches of &s;o flouri&s;hing
a city. But Parmenio, whom the king had &s;ent thither with a detachment of
hor&s;e, arrived very &s;ea&s;onably to &s;top the pro|gre&s;s of the fire, and
marched into the city, which he &s;aved, the barbarians having fled the moment
they heard of his arrival.</P>
<P>Through this city the Cydnus runs; a river not &s;o remarkable for
the breadth of its channel, as for the beauty of its waters, which are va&s;tly
limpid; but at the &s;ame time exce&s;&s;ively cold, becau&s;e of the tufted
trees with which its banks are over&s;hadowed. It was now about the end of the
&s;ummer, which is exce&s;&s;ively hot in Ci|licia, and in the hotte&s;t part
of the day; when the king, who was quite covered with &s;weat and dirt,
arriving on its banks, had a mind to bathe, invited by the beauty and
clear|ne&s;s of the &s;tream. However the in&s;tant he plunged into it, he was
&s;eized with &s;o violent a &s;hivering, that all the by-&s;tanders fancied he
was dying. Upon this, he was carried to his tent, after fainting away. The
phy&s;icians, who were &s;en&s;ible they &s;hould be an&s;werable for the
event, did not dare to hazard violent and extraordinary remedies. However,
Philip, one of his phy&s;icians, who had always attend|ed <PB N="175" REF="177"> upon him from his youth, and loved him with the utmo&s;t
tenderne&s;s, not only as his &s;overeign, but his child, rai&s;ing him&s;elf
(merely out of affection to Alexander) above all prudential con&s;iderations,
offered to give him a do&s;e, which, though not very violent, would
neverthele&s;s be &s;peedy in its effects; and de&s;ired three days to prepare
it. At this propo&s;al every one trembled, but he only whom it mo&s;t
concerned; Alexander being afflicted upon no other account, than becau&s;e it
would keep him three days from appearing at the head of his army.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were doing, Alexander received a letter from
Parmenio, who was left behind in Cappadocia, in whom Alexander put greater
confidence than in any other of his courtiers; the purport of which was, to bid
him beware of Philip his phy&s;ician, for that Darius had bribed him, by the
promi&s;e of a thou&s;and talents, and his &s;i&s;ter in marriage. This letter
gave him great unea&s;ine&s;s; for he was now at full lei&s;ure to weigh all
the rea&s;ons he might have to hope or fear. But the con&s;idence in a
phy&s;ician who&s;e &s;incere attachment and fidelity he had proved from his
infancy, &s;oon pre|vailed, and removed all &s;u&s;picions. He folded up the
letter, and put it under his bol&s;ter, <PB N="176" REF="178"> without
acquainting his attendants with the contents; in the mean time, his phy&s;ician
en|tered, with a medicine in his hand, and offered the cup to Alexander. The
hero upon this, took the cup from him, and holding out the letter, de&s;ired
the phy&s;ician to read, while he drank off the draught with an intrepid
coun|tenance, without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, or di&s;|covering the lea&s;t
&s;u&s;picion or unea&s;ine&s;s. The phy&s;ician, as he peru&s;ed the letter,
&s;hewed greater &s;igns of indignation than of fear; he bid him, with a
re&s;olute tone, harbour no un|ea&s;ine&s;s, and that the recovery of his
health would in a &s;hort time wipe off all &s;u&s;picion. In the mean time,
the phy&s;ic wrought &s;o vio|lently, that the &s;ymptoms &s;eemed to
&s;trengthen Parmenio's accu&s;ation; but at la&s;t, the me|dicine having
gained the a&s;cendant, he began to a&s;&s;ume his accu&s;tomed vigour; and in
about three days, he was able to &s;hew him&s;elf to his longing &s;oldiers, by
whom he was equally beloved and re&s;pected.</P>
<P>In the mean time Darius was on his march; filled with a vain
&s;ecurity in the &s;uperiority of his numbers; and con&s;ident not in the
valour, but in the &s;plendor of his forces. The plains of A&s;&s;yria, in
which he was encamped, gave him an opportunity of extending his hor&s;e as he 
<PB N="177" REF="179"> plea&s;ed, and of taking the advantage which the great
difference between the number of &s;oldiers in each army gave him. But
in&s;tead of this, he re&s;olved to march to narrow pa&s;&s;es, where his
cavalry, and the multitude of his troops, &s;o far from doing him any
&s;ervice, would only incumber each other; and accordingly, ad|vanced towards
the enemy, for whom he &s;hould have waited; and thus ran vi&s;ibly on his
de&s;truction.</P>
<P>His courtiers and attendants however, who&s;e cu&s;tom it was to
flatter and applaud all his actions, congratulated him upon an approaching
victory, as if it had been certain and inevitable. There was at that time, in
the army of Darius, one Caridemus, an Athenian, a man of great experience in
war, who per&s;onally hated Alex|ander, for having cau&s;ed him to be
barli&s;hed from Athens. Darius turning to this Athenian, a&s;ked whether he
believed him powerful enough to defeat his army. Caridemus, who had been
brought up in the bo&s;om of liberty, and for|getting that he was in a country
of &s;lavery, where to oppo&s;e the inclinations of the prince is of the mo&s;t
dangerous con&s;equence, replied as follows: 
<Q REND="inline">"Permit me, Sir, to &s;peak truth now, when only my
&s;incerity may be of &s;ervice; your pre&s;ent &s;plendor, your prodigious
num|bers <PB N="178" REF="180"> which have drained the ea&s;t, may be terrible
indeed to your effeminate neigh|bours, but can be no way dreadful to a
Macedonian army. Di&s;cipline, clo&s;e combat, courage, is all their care;
every &s;ingle man among them is almo&s;t him&s;elf a general. The&s;e men are
not to be repul&s;ed by the &s;tones of &s;lingers, or &s;takes burnt at the
end; none but troops armed like them&s;elves can &s;top their career; let
therefore the gold and &s;ilver which glitters in your camp, be ex|changed for
foldiers and &s;teel, for weapons and for hearts that are able to defend
you."</Q> Darius, though naturally of a mild di&s;po&s;ition, had all his
pa&s;&s;ions rou&s;ed at the freedom of this man's advice; he ordered him at
once to be executed; Caridemus all the time crying out, that his avenger was at
hand: Darius too &s;oon repented his ra&s;hne&s;s, and experienced when it was
too late, the truth of all that had been told him.</P>
<P>The emperor now advanced with his troops towards the river
Euphrates; over his tent was exhibited to the view of his whole army, the image
of the &s;un in jewels; while wealth and magnificence &s;hone in every quarter
of the army.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t they carried &s;ilver altars, on which lay fire, called by
them Sacred and Eternal; <PB N="179" REF="181"> and the&s;e were followed by
the Magi, &s;inging hymns, after the manner of their country: they were
accompanied by three hundred and &s;ixty-five youths (equalling the number of
days in a year) cloathed in purple robes. After|wards came a chariot
con&s;ecrated to Jupiter, drawn by white hor&s;es, and followed by a cour&s;er
of a prodigious &s;ize, to whom they gave the name of the Sun's Hor&s;e; and
the equeries were dre&s;&s;ed in white, each having a golden rod in his
hand.</P>
<P>Ten chariots, adorned with &s;culptures in gold and &s;ilver
followed after. Then marched a body of hor&s;e, compo&s;ed of twelve nations,
who&s;e manners and cu&s;toms were various, and all armed in a different
manner. Next advanced tho&s;e whom the Per&s;ians called The Immortals,
amounting to ten thou&s;and, who &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the barbarians
in the &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s of their apparel. They all wore golden collars, were
cloathed in robes of gold ti&s;&s;ue, with ve&s;t|ments having &s;leeves to
them quite covered with precious &s;tones.</P>
<P>Thirty paces from them followed tho&s;e called the king's relations,
to the number of fifteen thou&s;and, in habits very much re&s;embling tho&s;e
of women; and more remarkable for the vain pomp of their dre&s;s, than the
glitter of their arms.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="182"> Tho&s;e called the Doriphori came after; they
carried the king's cloak, and walked before his chariot, in which he &s;eemed
to &s;it, as on a high throne. This chariot was enriched on both &s;ides with
images of the gods, in gold and &s;ilver; and from the middle of the yoke,
which was covered with jewels, ro&s;e two &s;tatues, a cubit in height, the one
repre&s;enting War, the other Peace, having a golden eagle between them, with
wings extended, as ready to take its flight.</P>
<P>But nothing could equal the magnificence of the king: he was
cloathed in a ve&s;t of pur|ple, &s;triped with &s;ilver, and over it a long
robe, glittering all over with gold and pre|cious &s;tones, that repre&s;ented
two falcons, ru&s;hing from the clouds, and pecking at one another. Around his
wai&s;t he wore a golden girdle, after the manner of women, whence his
&s;cymitar hung, the &s;cabbard of which flamed all over with gems; on his head
he wore a tiara, or mitre, round which was a fillet of blue mixed with
white.</P>
<P>On each &s;ide of him walked two hundred of his neare&s;t relations,
followed by two thou&s;and pike-men, who&s;e pikes were adorned with &s;ilver,
and tipped with gold; and la&s;tly, thirty thou&s;and infantry, who compo&s;ed
the rear|guard. <PB N="181" REF="183"> The&s;e were followed by the king's
hor&s;es four hundred in number, all which were led.</P>
<P>About one hundred, or an hundred and twenty paces from thence, came
Sy&s;igambis, Darius's mother, &s;eated on a chariot, and his confort on
another; with the &s;everal female attendants of both queens, riding on
hor&s;eback. Afterwards came fifteen large chariots, in which were the king's
children, and tho&s;e who had the care of their education, with a band of
eunuchs, who are to this day in great e&s;teem among tho&s;e nations. Then
marched the concubines, to the number of three hundred and &s;ixty, in the
equipage of queens, followed by &s;ix hundred mules, and three hundred camels,
which car|ried the king's trea&s;ure, and guarded by a great body of
archers.</P>
<P>After the&s;e came the wives of the crown-officers, and of the
greate&s;t lords of the court; then the &s;utlers, and &s;ervants of the army,
&s;eated al&s;o in chariots.</P>
<P>In the rear were a body of light-armed troops, with their
commanders, who clo&s;ed the whole march.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;plendor of this pageant mo|narch; he took the field
encumbered with an unnece&s;&s;ary train of concubines, attended with 
<PB N="182" REF="184"> troops of various nations, &s;peaking different
lan|guages, for their numbers impo&s;&s;ible to be mar|&s;halled, and &s;o rich
and effeminate in gold and in garments, as &s;eemed rather to invite than deter
an invader.</P>
<P>Alexander, after marching from Tar&s;is, ar|rived at Bactriana; from
thence, &s;till earne&s;t in coming up with his enemy, he came to Solae, where
he offered &s;acrifice to E&s;culapius; from thence he went forward to Pyramus,
to Malles, and at la&s;t to Cartabala: it was here that he fir&s;t received
advice, that Darius, with his whole army, was encamped at Sochus in
A&s;|&s;yria, two days journey from Cilicia. He therefore re&s;olved, without
delay, to meet him there, as the badne&s;s of the weather ob|liged him to
halt.</P>
<P>In the mean time Darius led on his immen&s;e army into the plains of
A&s;&s;yria, which they co|vered to a great extent; there he was advi&s;ed by
the Grecian commanders who were in his &s;er|vice, and who compo&s;ed the
&s;trength of his army to halt, as he would there have &s;ufficient room to
expand his forces, and &s;urround the invader. Darius rejected their advice;
and in&s;tead of waiting Alexander's approach, vainly puffed up with pride by
his &s;urrounding courtiers, he re|&s;olved to pur&s;ue the invader, who
wi&s;hed for <PB N="183" REF="185"> nothing more ardently than to come to an
en|gagement.</P>
<P>Accordingly, Darius having &s;ent his trea&s;ures to Dama&s;cus, a
city of A&s;&s;yria, he marched with the main body of his army towards Cilicia,
then turned &s;hort towards I&s;&s;us; and quite ignorant of the &s;ituation of
the enemy, &s;uppo&s;ed he was pur&s;uing Alexander, when he had actually left
him in the rear. There is a &s;trange mixture of pride, cruelty, &s;plendor and
magnanimity, in all the actions of this Per&s;ian prince. At I&s;&s;us he
barbarou&s;ly put to death all the Greeks who were &s;ick in that city, a few
&s;oldiers only excepted, whom he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, after having made them view
every part of his camp, in order to report his numbers and his &s;trength to
the in|vader: the&s;e &s;oldiers accordingly brought Alex|ander word of the
approach of Darius; and he now began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of preparing for
battle.</P>
<P>Alexander fearing, from the numbers of the enemy, that they would
attack him in his camp, fortified it with a ditch and a rampart; but at the
&s;ame time di&s;covered great joy to &s;ee the enemy ha&s;tening to its own
de&s;truction, and preparing to attack him in a place which was but wide enough
for a &s;mall army to act and move at liberty in. Thus the two armies were 
<PB N="184" REF="186"> in &s;ome mea&s;ure reduced to an equality: the
Macedonians had &s;pace &s;ufficient to employ their whole force, while the
Per&s;ians had not room for the twentieth part of theirs.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, Alexander, as frequently hap|pens to the greate&s;t
captains, felt &s;ome emotion when he &s;aw that he was going to hazard all at
one blow. The more Fortune had favoured him hitherto, the more he now dreaded
her frowns; the moment approaching which was to determine his fate. But, on the
other &s;ide, his courage revived, from the reflection, that the rewards of his
toils exceeded the dangers of them; and though he was uncertain with regard to
the victory, he at lea&s;t hoped to die gloriou&s;ly, and like Alexander.
However, he did not divulge the&s;e thoughts to any one; well knowing, that,
upon the approach of a battle, a general ought not to di&s;cover the lea&s;t
marks of &s;adne&s;s or perplexity; and that the troops &s;hould read nothing
but re&s;olution and intrepidity in the countenance of their commander.</P>
<P>Having made his &s;oldiers refre&s;h them&s;elves, and ordered them
to be ready for the third watch of the night, which began at twelve, he went to
the top of a mountain, and there, by torch-light, &s;acrificed, after the
manner of his country, to the gods of the place. As &s;oon as 
<PB N="185" REF="187"> the &s;ignal was given, his army, which was ready to
march and fight, being commanded to make great &s;peed, arrived by day-break at
the &s;everal po&s;ts a&s;&s;igned them. But now the &s;pies bring|ing word
that Darius was not above thirty furlongs from them, the king cau&s;ed his army
to halt, and then drew it up in battle array. The pea&s;ants, in the greate&s;t
terror, came al&s;o, and acquainted Darius with the arrival of the enemy; which
he would not at fir&s;t believe, imagining, as we have ob&s;erved, that
Alex|ander fled before him, and was endeavouring to e&s;cape. This news threw
his troops into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; who, in their &s;urpri&s;e, ran to
their arms with great precipitation and di&s;order.</P>
<P>The &s;pot where the battle was fought, lay near the city of
I&s;&s;us, which the mountains bounded on one &s;ide, and the &s;ea on the
other. The plain that was &s;ituated between them both mu&s;t have been
con&s;iderably broad, as the two armies encamped in it; and I before
ob&s;erved, that Darius's army was va&s;tly numerous. The river Pinarius, ran
through the middle of this plain from the mountain to the &s;ea, and divided it
very near into two equal parts. The mountain formed a hollow kind of gulph, the
extremity of which in a curved line, bounded part of the plain.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="188"> Alexander drew up his army in the following
order. He po&s;ted at the extremity of the right wing, which &s;tood near the
mountains, the Argyra&s;pides, commanded by Nicanor; then the phalanx of
Coenus, and afterwards that of Perdicas, which terminated in the center of the
main army. On the extremity of the left wing, he po&s;ted the phalanx of
Amyntas, then that of Ptolemy, and la&s;tly that of Meleager. Thus the famous
Macedonian phalanx was formed, which we find was com|po&s;ed of &s;ix
di&s;tinct bodies. Each of tho&s;e was headed by able generals; but Alexander
being always generali&s;&s;imo, had con&s;equently the command of the whole
army. The hor&s;e were placed on the two wings; the Macedo|nians with the
The&s;&s;alians on the right, and of Peloponne&s;ians, with the other allies on
the left. Craterus commanded all the foot, which compo&s;ed the left wing, and
Parmenio the whole wing. Alexander had re&s;erved to him|&s;elf the command of
the right. He had de&s;ir|ed Parmenio to keep as near the &s;ea as
po&s;&s;ible, to prevent the barbarians from &s;urrounding him; and Nicanor on
the contrary, was ordered to keep at &s;ome di&s;tance from the mountains, to
keep him&s;elf out of the reach of the arrows di&s;+charged by tho&s;e who were
po&s;ted on them. He <PB N="187" REF="189"> covered the hor&s;e on his right
wing with the light hor&s;e of Protomachus and the Poeonians, and his foot with
the bowmen of Antiochus. He re&s;erved the Agrians (commanded by At|talus,) who
were greatly e&s;teemed, and &s;ome forces that were newly arrived from Greece,
to oppo&s;e tho&s;e Darius had po&s;ted on the moun|tains.</P>
<P>As for Darius's army, it was drawn up in the following order. Having
heard that Alex|ander was marching towards him in battle array, he commanded
thirty thou&s;and hor&s;e, and twenty thou&s;and bowmen to cro&s;s the river
Pinarius, that he might have an opportunity to draw up his army in a commodious
manner on the hither &s;ide. In the center he po&s;ted the thirty thou&s;and
Greeks in his &s;ervice, who doubtle&s;s were the flower and chief &s;trength
of his army, and were not at all inferior in bravery to the Macedonian phalanx,
with thirty thou|&s;and Barbarians on their right, and as many on their left.
The field of battle not being able to contain a greater number, the&s;e were
all heavily armed. The re&s;t of the infantry di&s;|tingui&s;hed by their
&s;everal nations, were ranged behind the fir&s;t line. It is pity Arrian does
not tell us the depth of each of tho&s;e two lines; but it mu&s;t have been
prodigious, if we con&s;ider <PB N="188" REF="190"> the extreme narrowne&s;s of
the pa&s;s, and the amazing multitude of the Per&s;ian forces. On the mountain
which lay to their left, again&s;t Alexander's right wing, Darius po&s;ted
twenty thou&s;and men, who were &s;o ranged (in the &s;everal windings of the
mountain) that &s;ome were behind Alexander's army, and others be|fore it.</P>
<P>Darius, after having &s;et his army in battle array, made his
hor&s;e cro&s;s the river again, and di&s;patched the greate&s;t part of them
towards the &s;ea again&s;t Parmenio, becau&s;e they could fight on that &s;pot
with the greate&s;t advantage. The re&s;t of his cavalry he &s;ent to the left,
to|wards the mountain. However, finding that the&s;e would be of no &s;ervice
on that &s;ide, be|cau&s;e of the too great narrowne&s;s of the &s;pot, he
cau&s;ed a great part of them to wheel about to the right. As for him&s;elf he
took his po&s;t in the center of his army, pur&s;uant to the cu&s;tom of the
Per&s;ian monarchs.</P>
<P>The two armies being thus drawn up in order of battle, Alexander
marched very &s;lowly, that his &s;oldiers might take a little breath; &s;o
that it was &s;uppo&s;ed they would not engage till very late. For Darius
&s;till continued with his army on the other &s;ide of the river, in order not
to lo&s;e the advantageous &s;ituation of his po&s;t; <PB N="189" REF="191">
and even cau&s;ed &s;uch parts of the &s;hore as were not craggy to be
&s;ecured with pali&s;adoes, where the Macedonians concluded that he was
already afraid of being defeated. The two armies being come in &s;ight,
Alexander riding along the ranks, called by their &s;everal names, the
principal officers both of the Macedonians and foreigners; and exhorted the
&s;oldiers to &s;ignalize them&s;elves, &s;peaking to each nation according to
its pecu|liar genius and di&s;po&s;ition. The whole army &s;et up a &s;hout and
eagerly de&s;ired to be led on directly again&s;t the enemy.</P>
<P>Alexander had advanced at fir&s;t very &s;lowly to prevent the ranks
on the front of his phalanx from breaking, and halted by intervals. But when he
was got within bow-&s;hot, he com|manded all his right wing to plunge
impetu|ou&s;ly into the river, purpo&s;ely that he might &s;urprize the
barbarians, come &s;ooner to a clo&s;e engagement, and be le&s;s expo&s;ed to
the enemy's arrows; in all which he was very &s;ucce&s;sful. Both &s;ides
fought with the utmo&s;t bravery and re&s;olution; and being now forced to
fight clo&s;e, they charged both &s;ides &s;word in hand, when a dreadful
&s;laughter en&s;ued, for they engaged man to man, each aiming the point of his
&s;word at the face of his opponent. Alexander who performed the duty both of a
private &s;oldier <PB N="190" REF="192"> and of a commander, wi&s;hed nothing
&s;o ar|dently as the glory of killing with his own hand Darius, who being
&s;eated on a high cha|riot, was con&s;picuous to the whole army; and by that
means was a powerful object both to encourage his own &s;oldiers to defend, and
the enemy to attack him. And now the battle grew more furious and bloody than
before, &s;o that a great number of Per&s;ian noblemen were killed. Each &s;ide
fought with incredible bra|very. Oxathres, brother to Darius, ob&s;erving that
Alexander was going to charge that mo|narch with the utmo&s;t vigour, ru&s;hed
before his chariot with the hor&s;e under his command and di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf above the re&s;t. The hor&s;es that drew Darius's chariot lo&s;t all
com|mand, and &s;hook the yoke &s;o violently, that they were upon the point of
overturning the king, who &s;eeing him&s;elf going to fall alive into the hands
of his enemies, leaped down and mounted another chariot. The re&s;t ob&s;erving
this fled as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and throwing down their arms, made the
be&s;t of their way. Alex|ander had received a &s;light wound in his thigh, but
happily it was not attended with ill con|&s;equences. Whil&s;t part of the
Macedonian in|fantry (po&s;ted to the right,) were driving the advantages they
had gained again&s;t the Per&s;ians, <PB N="191" REF="193"> the remainder of
them who engaged the Greeks, met with greater re&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e
ob&s;erving that the body of infantry in que&s;tion, were no longer covered by
the right wing of Alex|ander's army, which was pur&s;uing the enemy, came and
attacked it in flank. The engagement was very bloody, and victory a long time
doubt|ful. The Greeks endeavoured to pu&s;h the Macedonians into the river, and
to recover the di&s;order into which the left wing had been thrown. The
Macedonians al&s;o &s;ignalized them|&s;elves with the utmo&s;t bravery, in
order to pre|&s;erve the advantage which Alexander had ju&s;t before gained and
&s;upport the honour of their phalanx, which had always been con&s;idered as
invincible. There was al&s;o a perpetual jealou&s;y between the Greeks and
Macedonians, which greatly increa&s;ed their courage, and made the
re&s;i&s;tance on each &s;ide very vigorous. On Alexander's &s;ide Ptolemy the
&s;on of Seleucus, lo&s;t his life with an hundred and twenty more
con&s;iderable officers, who all had behaved with the utmo&s;t gallantry.</P>
<P>In the mean time the right wing, which was victorious under its
Monarch, after defeating all who oppo&s;ed it, wheeled to the left again&s;t
tho&s;e Greeks who were fighting with the re&s;t of the Macedonian phalanx,
whom they <PB N="192" REF="194"> charged very vigorou&s;ly; and attacking them
in flank entirely routed them.</P>
<P>At the very beginning of the engagement the Per&s;ian cavalry, which
was in the right wing (without waiting for their being attacked by the
Macedonians) had cro&s;&s;ed the river and ru&s;hed upon the The&s;&s;alian
hor&s;e, &s;everal of who&s;e &s;quadrons they broke. Upon this the remainder
of the latter, in order to avoid the impetuo&s;ity of the fir&s;t charge, and
oblige the Per&s;ians to break their ranks, made a feint of retiring, as
terrified by the prodigious numbers of the enemy. The Per&s;ians &s;eeing this,
were filled with boldne&s;s and confidence; and there|upon, the greate&s;t part
of them advancing, without order or precaution, as to a certain victory had no
thoughts but of pur&s;uing the enemy. Upon this the The&s;&s;alians &s;eeing
them in &s;uch confu&s;ion, faced about on a &s;udden and renewed the fight
with fre&s;h ardour. The Per&s;ians made a brave defence, till they &s;aw
Darius put to flight, and the Greeks cut to pieces by the phalanx, when they
fled in the utmo&s;t di&s;order.</P>
<P>With regard to Darius, the in&s;tant he &s;aw his left wing broke,
he was one of the fir&s;t who fled in his chariot; but get|ting afterwards into
craggy rugged places, <PB N="193" REF="195"> he mounted on hor&s;eback,
throwing down his bow, &s;hield and royal mantle. Alexander, however did not
attempt to pur&s;ue him, till he &s;aw his phalanx had conquered the Greeks,
and the Per&s;ian hor&s;e put to flight; which was of great advantage to the
prince that fled.</P>
<P>Sy&s;igambis, Darius's mother, and that mo|narch's queen, who al&s;o
was his &s;i&s;ter, were found remaining in the camp, with two of the king's
daughters, his &s;on (yet a child) and &s;ome Per|&s;ian ladies; for the re&s;t
had been carried to Dama&s;cus, with part of Darius's trea&s;ure, and all
&s;uch things as contributed only to the luxury and magnificence of his court.
No more than three thou&s;and talents were found in his camp; but the re&s;t of
the trea&s;ure fell after|wards into the hands of Parmenio, at the taking the
city of Dama&s;cus.</P>
<P>As for the barbarians, having exerted them|&s;elves with bravery
enough in the fir&s;t attack, they afterwards gave way in the mo&s;t &s;hameful
manner; and being intent upon nothing but &s;aving them&s;elves, they took
different ways. Some &s;truck into the high road, which led directly to
Per&s;ia; others ran into woods and lonely mountains; and a &s;mall number
return|ed to their camp, which the victorious enemy had already taken and
plundered. In this battle <PB N="194" REF="196"> three&s;core thou&s;and of the
Per&s;ian infantry and ten thou&s;and hor&s;emen were &s;lain; forty
thou|&s;and were taken pri&s;oners, while of Alexander's army there fell but
two hundred and four&s;core men in all.</P>
<P>The evening after the engagement, Alexander invited his chief
officers to a fea&s;t, at which he him&s;elf pre&s;ided, notwith&s;tanding he
had been wounded that day in battle. The fe&s;tivity how|ever had &s;carce
begun, when they were inter|rupted by &s;ad lamentations from a neighbour|ing
tent, which at fir&s;t they con&s;idered as a fre&s;h alarm, but they were
&s;oon taught, that it came from the tent, in which the wife and mother of
Darius were kept, who were ex|pre&s;&s;ing their &s;orrow for the &s;uppo&s;ed
death of Darius. An eunuch, who had &s;een his cloak in the hands of a
&s;oldier, imagining he was killed, brought them the&s;e dreadful tidings.
Alex|ander, however &s;ent one of his officers to un|deceive them, and to
inform them that the emperor was &s;till alive. The women little u&s;ed to the
appearance of &s;trangers, upon the ar|rival of the Macedonian &s;oldier,
imagining he was &s;ent to put them to death, threw them&s;elves at his feet,
and intreated him to &s;pare them a little while. They were ready they &s;aid
to die; and only de&s;ired to bury Darius, before <PB N="195" REF="197"> they
&s;hould &s;uffer. The &s;oldier a&s;&s;ured them, that he came rather to
comfort than afflict them, that the monarch whom they deplored, was &s;till
living, and he gave Sy&s;igambis his hand to rai&s;e her from the ground.</P>
<P>The next day Alexander, after vi&s;iting the wounded, cau&s;ed the
la&s;t honours to be paid to the dead in pre&s;ence of the whole army, drawn up
in the mo&s;t &s;plendid order of battle. He treated the Per&s;ians of
di&s;tinction in the &s;ame manner, and permitted Darius's mother, to bury
whatever per&s;ons &s;he plea&s;ed according to the cu&s;toms, and ceremonies
practi&s;ed in her country. After this, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the queens,
to inform them, that he was coming to pay them a vi&s;it; and accordingly,
com|manding all his train to withdraw, he entered the tent accompanied only by
Hephoe&s;tion, who made &s;o cautious and di&s;creet a u&s;e of the liberty
granted him, that he &s;eemed to take it not &s;o much out of inclination, as
from a de&s;ire to obey the king who would have it &s;o. They were of the
&s;ame age, but Hephoe&s;tion was taller, &s;o that the queens took him fir&s;t
for the king, and paid him their re&s;pects as &s;uch. But &s;ome captive
eunuchs &s;hewing them Alexander, Sy&s;i|gambis fell pro&s;trate before him,
and intreated pardon for her mi&s;take, but the king rai&s;ing 
<PB N="196" REF="198"> her from the ground, a&s;&s;ured her this his friend
al&s;o was another Alexander; and after com|forting her and her attendants,
took the &s;on of Darius that was yet but a child in his arms. The infant,
without di&s;covering the lea&s;t terror, &s;tretched out his arms to the
conqueror, who being affected with its confidence, &s;aid to Hephoe&s;tion, Oh!
that Darius had &s;ome &s;hare, &s;ome portion of this infant's
genero&s;ity.&mdash;This interview has done more honour to Alexander's
character, than all the re&s;t of: his conque&s;ts: the gentlene&s;s of his
manners to the &s;uppliant captives, his cha&s;tity and continence, when he had
the power to enforce obedience, were &s;etting an example to heroes, which it
has been the pride of many &s;ince to imitate.</P>
<P>After this overthrow, all Phoenicia, the ca|pital city of Tyre only
excepted, was yielded to the conqueror, and Parmenio was made gover|nor. Good
fortune followed him &s;o fa&s;t, that it rewarded him beyond his expectations.
An|tigonus his general in A&s;ia, overthrew the Ca|padocians, Paphlagonians,
and others lately re|volted. Ari&s;todemus the Per&s;ian admiral, was overcome
at &s;ea, and a great part of his fleet taken. The city of Dama&s;cus al&s;o,
in which the trea&s;ures of Darius were depo&s;ited, was given up to Alexander.
The governor of this <PB N="197" REF="199"> place forgetting the duty he owed
his &s;overeign, informed Alexander by letter upon a certain day, that he would
lead out his &s;oldiers laden with &s;poil from the city, as if willing to
&s;ecure a retreat; and the&s;e with all their wealth might be taken with a
proper body of troops to intercept them. Alexander punctually followed the
go|vernor's in&s;truction, and thus became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an immen&s;e
plunder. Be&s;ides money and plate which was afterwards coined, and amount|ed
to immen&s;e &s;ums, thirty thou&s;and men and &s;even thou&s;and bea&s;ts
laden with baggage were taken. We find by Parmenio's letter to Alex|ander, that
he found in Dama&s;cus, three hun|dred and twenty nine of Darius's concubines
all admirably well &s;killed in mu&s;ic, and al&s;o a multitude of officers,
who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to regulate and prepare every thing relating to
that monarch's entertainments.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Darius having travelled on hor&s;eback the whole
night, &s;truck with terror and con&s;ternation, arrived in the morning at
Sochus, where he a&s;&s;embled the remains of his army: &s;till however his
pride would not for|&s;ake him with his fortune; he wrote a letter to
Alexander, in which he rather treated him as an inferior; he commanded, rather
than re|que&s;ted that Alexander would take a ran&s;om <PB N="198" REF="200">
for his mother, wife and children. With re|gard to the empire, he would fight
with him for it upon equal terms; and bring an equal number of troops into the
field. To this Alex|ander replied, That he di&s;dained all corre&s;pon|dence
with a man whom he had already over|come; that in ca&s;e he appeared before him
in a &s;upplicating po&s;ture, he would give up his wife and mother without
ran&s;om; that he knew how to conquer, and to oblige the conquered.</P>
<P>Thus coming to no i&s;&s;ue, the king marched from thence into
Phoenicia, the citizens of Byblos opening their gates to him. Every one
&s;ubmitted as he advanced, but no people did this with greater plea&s;ure than
the Sidonians: We have &s;een in what manner Ochus had de|&s;troyed their city
eighteen years before, and put all the inhabitants of it to the &s;word. After
he was returned into Per&s;ia, &s;uch of the citizens, as, upon account of
their traffic or for &s;ome other cau&s;e, had been ab&s;ent, and by that means
had e&s;caped the ma&s;&s;acre, returned thither and rebuilt their city. But
they had retain|ed &s;o violent a hatred to the Per&s;ians, that they were
overjoyed at this opportunity of throwing off their yoke; and indeed they were
the fir&s;t in that country who &s;ubmitted to the king by their deputies, in
oppo&s;ition to Strato their <PB N="199" REF="201"> king, who had declared in
favour of Darius. Alexander dethroned him, and permitted He|phoe&s;tion to
elect in his &s;tead, whom&s;oever of the Sidonians he &s;hould judge worthy of
&s;o ex|alted a &s;tation.</P>
<P>This favourite was quartered at the hou&s;e of two brothers who were
young, and of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable family in the city; to the&s;e he
of|fered the crown. But they refu&s;ed it, telling him that according to the
laws of their country, no per&s;on could a&s;cend the throne unle&s;s he were
of the blood royal. Hephoe&s;tion admiring this greatne&s;s of &s;oul, which
could contemn what others &s;trive to obtain by fire and &s;word; 
<Q REND="inline">"Continue, &s;ays he to them, in this way of
thinking, you who before were &s;en&s;ible that it is much more glorious to
refu&s;e a diadem, than to accept it. However, name me &s;ome per&s;on of the
royal family, who may remem|ber when he is king, that it was you &s;et the
crown on his head."</Q> The brothers ob&s;erv|ing, that &s;everal through
exce&s;&s;ive ambition; a&s;pired to this high &s;tation, and to obtain it,
paid a &s;ervile court to Alexander's favourites, declared, that they did not
know any per&s;on more worthy of the diadem than one Abdolo|nymus, de&s;cended,
though at a great di&s;tance, from the royal line; but who, at the &s;ame time 
<PB N="200" REF="202"> was &s;o poor that he was obliged to get his bread by
day labour in a garden without the city. His hone&s;ty and integrity had
reduced him, as well as many more, to &s;uch extreme poverty. Solely intent
upon his labour, he did not hear the cla&s;hing of the arms which had &s;haken
all A&s;ia.</P>
<P>Immediately the two brothers went in &s;earch of Abdolonymus, with
the royal garments, and found him weeding in his garden. When they &s;aluted
him king, Abdolonymus looked upon the whole as a dream; and, unable to gue&s;s
the meaning of it, a&s;ked if they were not a&s;hamed to ridicule him in that
manner? But as he made a greater re&s;i&s;tance than &s;uited their
incli|nations, they them&s;elves wa&s;hed him, and threw over his &s;houlders a
purple robe, richly em|broidered with gold; then after repeated oaths of their
being in earne&s;t, they conducted him to the palace.</P>
<P>The news of this was immediately &s;pread over the whole city.
Mo&s;t of the inhabitants were overjoyed at it, but &s;ome murmured,
e&s;|pecially the rich, who de&s;pi&s;ing Abdolonymus's former abject &s;tate,
could not forbear &s;hewing their re&s;entment upon that account in the king's
court. Alexander commanded the new-elected prince to be &s;ent for, and after
&s;urveying him <PB N="210" REF="203"> attentively a long time, he &s;poke
thus: 
<Q REND="inline">"Thy air and mien do not contradict what is related
of thy extraction; but I &s;hould be glad to know with what frame of mind thou
did&s;t bear thy poverty?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"Would to the gods (replied he) that I may bear this
crown with equal patience. The&s;e hands have procured me all I de&s;ired; and
whil&s;t I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed nothing, I wanted no|thing."</Q> This an&s;wer
gave Alexander an high idea of Abdolonymus's virtue; &s;o that he pre|&s;ented
him, not only with the rich furniture which had belonged to Strato, and part of
the Per&s;ian plunder, but likewi&s;e annexed one of the neighbouring provinces
to his dominions.</P>
<P>Syria and Phoenicia, were already &s;ubdued by the Macedonians, the
city of Tyre except|ed. This city was ju&s;tly entitled the Queen of the Sea,
that element bringing to it the tribute of all nations. She boa&s;ted her
having fir&s;t in|vented navigation, and taught mankind the art of braving the
winds and waves by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a frail bark. The happy &s;ituation
of Tyre, the conveniency and extent of its ports, the character of its
inhabitants, who were indu&s;|trious, laborious, patient, and extremely
cour|teous to &s;trangers; invited thither merchants from all parts of the
globe, &s;o that it might be con&s;idered, not &s;o much as a city belonging to
<PB N="202" REF="204"> any particular nation, as the common city of all
nations, and the center of their commerce.</P>
<P>Alexander thought it nece&s;&s;ary both for his pride and his
intere&s;t to take this city. The &s;pring was now coming on. Tyre was at that
time &s;eated in an i&s;land of the &s;ea, about a quarter of a league from the
continent. It was &s;urrounded with a &s;trong wall, an hun|dred and fifty feet
high, which the waves of the &s;ea wa&s;hed, and the Carthaginians (a colony
from Tyre) a mighty people, and &s;overeigns of the ocean, who&s;e
amba&s;&s;adors were at that time in the city offering to Hercules, according
to ancient cu&s;tom, an annual &s;acrifice, had en|gaged them&s;elves to
&s;uccour the Tyrians. It was this made them &s;o haughty; firmly deter|mined
not to &s;urrender, they fix machines on the ramparts and on the towers, arm
their young men, and build workhou&s;es for the arti|ficers, of whom there were
great numbers in the city, &s;o that every part re&s;ounded with the noi&s;e of
warlike preparations. They likewi&s;e ca&s;t iron grapples to throw on the
enemy's works, and tear them away; as al&s;o cramp irons, and &s;uch like
in&s;truments formed for the defence of cities. So many difficulties oppo&s;ing
&s;uch a hazardous de&s;ign, and &s;o many rea&s;ons &s;hould have made
Alexander decline the &s;iege.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="205"> It was impo&s;&s;ible to come near this city
in order to &s;torm it, without making a bank, which would reach from the
continent to the i&s;land; and an attempt of this kind would be attended with
difficulties, that were &s;eem|ingly in&s;urmountable. The little arm of the
&s;ea, which &s;eparated the i&s;land from the con|tinent, was expo&s;ed to the
we&s;t wind, which often rai&s;ed &s;uch dreadful &s;torms there, that the
waves would in an in&s;tant, &s;weep away all works. Be&s;ides, as the city was
&s;urrounded on all &s;ides by the &s;ea, there was no fixing &s;caling
ladders, nor throwing up batteries, but at a di&s;tance in the &s;hips; and the
wall which pro|jected into the &s;ea towards the lower part, pre|vented people
from landing; not to mention that the military engines, which might have been
put on board the gallies, could not do much execution, the waves were &s;o very
tu|multuous.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;tacles however by no means retard|ed the enterprizing
re&s;olutions of Alexander, but willing to gain a place, rather by treaty than
by the &s;word, he &s;ent heralds into the place, propo&s;ing a peace, between
the Tyrians and him. The citizens however, a tumultuous un|governable body,
in&s;tead of li&s;tening to his propo&s;als, in&s;tead of endeavouring to avert
his <PB N="204" REF="206"> re&s;entment, contrary to the law of nations, killed
his heralds, and threw them from the top of the walls into the &s;ea. This
outrage inflamed Alexander's pa&s;&s;ions to the highe&s;t degree, he
re&s;olved upon the city's de&s;truction, and &s;at down before it with
per&s;evering re&s;entment. His fir&s;t endeavour was to form a pier jutting
from the continent, and reaching to the city which was built upon an i&s;land.
From the foun|dations of an ancient city upon the &s;hore, he dug &s;tones and
rubbi&s;h; from mount Lebanus, that hung over the city, he cut down cedars that
&s;erved for piles; and thus he began his work without interruption. But the
farther they went from &s;hore, the greater difficulties they met with,
becau&s;e the &s;ea was deeper, and the workmen were much annoyed by the darts
di&s;|charged from the top of the walls. The enemy al&s;o who were ma&s;ters at
&s;ea, coming in great boats, prevented the Macedonians from carry|ing on their
work with vigour. At la&s;t, how|ever the pile appeared above water, a level of
con&s;iderable breadth: then the be&s;ieged at la&s;t perceived their
ra&s;hne&s;s; they &s;aw with terror the va&s;tne&s;s of the work which the
&s;ea had till then kept from their &s;ight, and now began to attack the
workmen with javelins and wound them at a di&s;tance. It was therefore 
<PB N="205" REF="207"> re&s;olved that &s;kins and &s;ails &s;hould be &s;pread
to cover the workmen, and that two wooden towers &s;hould be rai&s;ed at the
head of the bank to prevent the approaches of the enemy. Yet the&s;e were
burned &s;oon after by the be&s;ieged, together with all the wood-work
compo&s;ing the pile that could be touched by the fire.</P>
<P>Alexander though he &s;aw mo&s;t of his de&s;igns defeated, and his
works demoli&s;hed, was not at all dejected upon that account. His &s;oldiers
en|deavoured with redoubled vigour, to repair the ruins of the bank; and made
and planted new machines, with &s;uch prodigious &s;peed as quite
a&s;toni&s;hed the enemy. Alexander him&s;elf was pre&s;ent on all occa&s;ions,
and &s;uperintended every part of the works. His pre&s;ence and great
abi|lities advanced the&s;e &s;till more, than the mul|titude of hands employed
in them. The whole was near fini&s;hed, and brought almo&s;t to the wall of the
city, when there aro&s;e on a &s;udden an impetuous wind, which drove the waves
with &s;o much fury again&s;t the mole, that the cement and other things that
barr'd it, gave way, and the water ru&s;hing through the &s;tones, broke it in
the middle. As &s;oon as the great heap of &s;tones which &s;upported the earth
was thrown down, the whole &s;unk at once as into an aby&s;s.</P>
<P>Any warrior but Alexander would that in&s;tant have quite laid
a&s;ide his enterprize; and indeed <PB N="206" REF="208"> he him&s;elf debated
whether he &s;hould not rai&s;e the &s;iege. But a &s;uperior Power, who had
foretold and &s;worn the ruin of Tyre, and who&s;e orders this prince only
executed, prompted him to continue the &s;iege; and, di&s;pelling all his fear
and anxiety, in&s;pired him with courage and confidence, and fired the
brea&s;ts of his whole army with the &s;ame &s;entiments. For now the
&s;oldiers, as if but that moment arrived be|fore the city, forgetting all the
toils they had undergone, began to rai&s;e a new mole, at which they worked
ince&s;&s;antly.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Alexander being con|vinced that while the enemy
remained ma&s;ters at &s;ea, the city could not be taken, with great diligence
procured a fleet from various parts, and embarking him&s;elf, with &s;ome
&s;oldiers from among his guard, he &s;et &s;ail towards the Tyrian fleet,
forming a line of battle. The Tyrians were at fir&s;t determined to oppo&s;e
him openly; but perceiving the &s;uperiority of his forces, they kept all the
gallies in their harbour, to pre|vent the enemy from entering there. Alexander
therefore was contented to draw up his &s;hips near the bank along the &s;hore,
where they rode in &s;afety, and kept the enemy from annoying his workmen, who
were employed upon the bank.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209"> The be&s;iegers, thus protected, went on with
great vigour. The workmen threw into the &s;ea whole trees, with all their
branches on them; and laid great &s;tones over the&s;e, on which they put other
trees, and the latter they covered with clay, which &s;erved in&s;tead of
mortar. Afterwards, heaping more trees and &s;tones on the&s;e, the whole, thus
joined together, formed one entire body. This bank was made wider than the
former ones; in order that the towers that were built in the middle, might be
out of the reach of &s;uch arrows as &s;hould be &s;hot from tho&s;e &s;hips
which might attempt to break down the edges of the bank. Thus, after many
delays, the patience of the workmen &s;urmounting every ob&s;tacle, it was at
la&s;t fini&s;hed in its utmo&s;t perfection. The Mace|donians placed military
engines of all kinds on the bank, in order to &s;hake the walls with
battering-rams, and hurl on the be&s;ieged ar|rows, &s;tones, and burning
torches. Thus, by degrees, approaching to the foot of the wall, the Tyrians
were attacked in clo&s;e combat, and inve&s;ted on all &s;ides, both by &s;ea
and land.</P>
<P>A general attack was now therefore thought nece&s;&s;ary; and the
king manning his gallies, which he had joined to each other, ordered them to
approach the walls about midnight, <PB N="208" REF="210"> and attack the city
with re&s;olution. The Ty|rians now gave them&s;elves over for lo&s;t; when on
a &s;udden the &s;ky was over&s;pread with &s;uch thick clouds, as quite took
away the faint glimmerings of light which before darted through the gloom; the
&s;ea ro&s;e by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, and the billows being &s;welled by the
fury of the winds, encrea&s;ed to a dreadful &s;torm; the ve&s;&s;els da&s;hed
one again&s;t the other with &s;o much violence, that the cables, which before
fa&s;tened them together, were either loo&s;ened or broke to pieces; the planks
&s;plit, and making a horrible cra&s;h, carried off the &s;oldiers with them;
for the tempe&s;t was &s;o furious, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to manage or
&s;teer the gallies thus fa&s;tened together. At la&s;t, however, they brought
them near the &s;hore, but the greate&s;t part were in a&s;hattered
condition.</P>
<P>This good fortune of the Tyrians was coun|terbalanced by an
unexpected calamity; they had long expected &s;uccours from Carthage, a
flouri&s;hing colony of their own, but they now received advice from thence
that the Car|thaginians were ab&s;olutely unable to give them any
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; being over-awed them&s;elves by a powerful army of
Syracu&s;ans, who were laying wa&s;te their country. The Tyrians therefore,
fru&s;trated in their hopes, &s;till maintained their <PB N="209" REF="211">
re&s;olution of defending them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity; and accordingly
&s;ent off their women and children to Carthage, as being of no u&s;e in the
defence of their city.</P>
<P>And now the engines playing, the city was warmly attacked on all
&s;ides, and as vigorou&s;ly defended. The be&s;ieged, taught and animated by
imminent danger, and the extreme nece&s;&s;ity to which they were reduced,
invented daily new arts, to defend them&s;elves, and repul&s;e the enemy. They
warded off all the darts di&s;|charged from the bali&s;tas again&s;t them, by
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of turning-wheels, which either broke them to pieces, or
carried them another way. They deadened the violence of the &s;tones that were
hurled at them, by &s;etting up a kind of &s;ails and curtains, made of a
&s;oft &s;ub&s;tance, which ea&s;ily gave way. To annoy the &s;hips which
advanced again&s;t their walls, they fixed grappling irons and &s;cythes to
joi&s;ts or beams; then &s;training their catapultas (an enormous kind of
cro&s;s-bow), they laid tho&s;e great pieces of timber upon them in&s;tead of
arrows, and &s;hot them off on a &s;udden at the enemy: the&s;e cru&s;hed
&s;ome to pieces by their great weight; and the hooks, or pen&s;ile &s;cythes,
with which they were armed, tore others to pieces, and did con&s;iderable
damage to their &s;hips. They al&s;o <PB N="210" REF="212"> had brazen
&s;hields, which they drew red-hot out of the fire; and, filling the&s;e with
burning &s;and, hurled them in an in&s;tant from the top of the wall upon the
enemy. There was nothing the Macedonians &s;o much dreaded as this la&s;t
in|vention; for, the moment this burning &s;and got to the fle&s;h, through the
crevices in the armour, it pierced to the very bone, and &s;tuck &s;o clo&s;e
that there was no pulling it off; &s;o that the &s;oldiers throwing down their
arms, and tearing their cloaths to pieces, were in this manner ex|po&s;ed,
naked and defencele&s;s, to the &s;hot of the enemy. It was now thought that
Alexander, quite di&s;couraged with his lo&s;s, was determined to re|linqui&s;h
the &s;iege; but he re&s;olved to make a la&s;t effort, with a great number of
&s;hips, which he manned with the flower of his army. Ac|cordingly, a &s;econd
naval engagement was fought; in which the Tyrians, after fighting with
intrepidity, were obliged to draw off their whole fleet towards the city. The
king pur&s;ued their rear very clo&s;e, but was not able to enter the harbour,
being repul&s;ed by arrows &s;hot from the walls: however, he either took or
&s;unk a great number of their &s;hips.</P>
<P>Both the attack and defence were now more vigorous than ever. The
courage of the com|batants increa&s;ed with the danger; and each 
<PB N="211" REF="213"> &s;ide, animated by the mo&s;t powerful motives, fought
like lions. Wherever the battering-rams had beat down any part of the wall, and
the bridges were thrown out, in&s;tantly the Argy|ra&s;pides mounted the breach
with the utmo&s;t valour, being headed by Admetus, one of the brave&s;t
officers in the army, who was killed by the thru&s;t of a &s;pear, as he was
encouraging his &s;oldiers. The pre&s;ence of the king, and e&s;pecially the
example he &s;et, fired his troops with unu&s;ual bravery. He him&s;elf
a&s;cended one of the towers, which was of a prodigious height, and there was
expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t dangers his courage had ever made him hazard; for
being immediately known, by his in&s;ignia, and the richne&s;s of his armour,
he &s;erved as a mark for all the arrows of the enemy. On this occa&s;ion he
performed wonders; killing with javelins &s;everal of tho&s;e who defended the
wall; then advancing nearer to them, he forced &s;ome with his &s;word, and
others with his &s;hield, either into the city or the &s;ea; the tower where he
fought almo&s;t touching the wall. He &s;oon a&s;cended the wall, by the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of floating bridges; and, followed by the principal officers,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of two towers, and the &s;pace between them. The
battering-rams had already made &s;everal breaches; the fleet had forced into
the <PB N="212" REF="214"> harbour; and &s;ome of the Macedonians had
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the towers which were abandoned. The Tyrians
&s;eeing the enemy ma&s;ter of their rampart, retired towards an open place,
called Agenor, and there &s;tood their ground; but Alexander marching up with
his regiment of body-guards, killed part of them, and obliged the re&s;t to
fly. At the &s;ame time Tyre being taken on that &s;ide which lay towards the
harbour, the Macedonians ran up and down every part of the city, &s;paring no
per&s;on who came in their way, being highly exa&s;perated at the long
re&s;i&s;tance of the be&s;ieged, and the bar|barities they had exerci&s;ed
towards &s;ome of their comrades, who had been taken in their return to Sidon,
and thrown from the battle|ments, after their throats had been cut, in the
&s;ight of the whole army. The Tyrians, thus reduced to the la&s;t extremity,
&s;hut them&s;elves up in their hou&s;es, to avoid the &s;word of the
conqueror; others ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of the enemy, to &s;ell their lives
as dearly as they could; and &s;ome threw &s;tones from the tops of the
hou&s;es, to cru&s;h the &s;ailors below: the old men waited at their doors,
expecting every in&s;tant to be &s;acrificed, from the rage of the &s;oldiers.
In this general carnage, the Sidonian &s;oldiers alone, that were in
Alexander's army, &s;eemed <PB N="213" REF="215"> touched with pity for the
fate of their wretched inhabitants: they gave protection to many of the
Tyrians, whom they con&s;idered as country|men, and carried great numbers of
them pri|vately on board their &s;hips. The numbers that were thus
&s;laughtered by the enraged &s;oldiers, were incredible: even after
conque&s;t, the victor's re&s;entment did not &s;ub&s;ide; he ordered no le&s;s
than two thou&s;and men, that were taken in the &s;torm, to be nailed to
cro&s;&s;es along the &s;hore. The number of pri&s;oners amounted to thirty
thou&s;and, and were all &s;old as &s;laves, in different parts of the world.
Thus fell Tyre, that had been for many ages the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing city in
the world, and had &s;pread the arts of commerce into the remote&s;t
regions.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Alexander was carrying on the &s;iege of Tyre, he received
a &s;econd letter from Darius, in which that monarch &s;eemed more &s;en&s;ible
of his power than before; he now gave him the title of king, and offered him
ten thou&s;and ta|lents as a ran&s;om for his captive mother and wife; he
offered him his daughter Statira in marriage, with all the country he had
con|quered, as far as the river Euphrates; he hinted to him the incon&s;tancy
of fortune, and de&s;cribed at large the powers he was &s;till
po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of to oppo&s;e. The&s;e terms were &s;o con|&s;iderable, 
<PB N="214" REF="216"> that when the king debated upon them in council,
Parmenio, one of his generals, could not help ob&s;erving, That if he were
Alexander, he would agree to &s;uch a propo&s;al; to which Alexander nobly
replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"And &s;o would I, were I Parmenio:"</Q> He
therefore treated the propo&s;als of Darius with haughty contempt, and
refu&s;ed to accept of trea&s;ures which he already con&s;idered as his own.
From Tyre Alexander marched to Jeru&s;alem, fully re&s;olved to puni&s;h that
city, for having refu&s;ed to &s;upply his army with provi&s;ions during the
late &s;iege; but the re&s;entment of the conqueror was averted, by meeting a
proce&s;&s;ion of the in|habitants of that city on his way, marching out to
receive him, dre&s;&s;ed in white, with a Jewi&s;h high-prie&s;t before them,
with a mitre on his head, on the front of which the name of God was written.
The moment the king perceived the high-prie&s;t, he advanced towards him with
an air of the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect, bowed his body, adored the augu&s;t
name upon his front, and &s;aluted him who wore it with religious veneration.
Then the Jews, &s;urrounding Alex|ander, rai&s;ed their voices to wi&s;h him
every kind of pro&s;perity. All the &s;pectators were &s;eized with
inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e; they could &s;carce believe their eyes; and did
not know <PB N="215" REF="217"> how to account for a &s;ight &s;o contrary to
their expectation, and &s;o va&s;tly improbable.</P>
<P>Parmenio, who could not yet recover from his a&s;toni&s;hment,
a&s;ked the king how it came to pa&s;s that he who was adored by every one,
adored the high-prie&s;t of the Jews: 
<Q REND="inline">"I do not," replied Alexander, "adore the
high-prie&s;t, but the God who&s;e mini&s;ter he is; for whil&s;t I was at Dia
in Macedonia, my mind wholly fixed on the great de&s;ign of the Per&s;ian
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ar, as I was revolving the methods
how to conquer A&s;ia, this very man, dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame robes, appeared
to me in a dream, exhorted me to bani&s;h my fear, bade me cro&s;s the
Helle&s;pont boldly, and a&s;&s;ured me that God would march at the head of my
army, and give me the victory over that of the Per&s;ians."</Q> This &s;peech,
delivered with an air of &s;incerity, no doubt had its effect in encouraging
the army, and e&s;tabli&s;hing an opinion that Alexander's mi&s;&s;ion was from
Heaven. Alexander having embraced the high-prie&s;t, was conducted by him to
the temple, where, after he had explained to him many prophecies in different
parts of the Old Te&s;tament, concerning his inva&s;ion, he taught him to offer
up a &s;acrifice in the Jewi&s;h manner.</P>
<P>Alexander was &s;o much plea&s;ed with his re|ception upon this
occa&s;ion, that, before he left <PB N="216" REF="218"> Jeru&s;alem, he
a&s;&s;embled the Jews, and bade them a&s;k any favour they &s;hould think
proper. Their reque&s;t was, To be allowed to live ac|cording to their ancient
laws and maxims; to be exempted from tribute every &s;eventh year, as they were
by their laws exempted from la|bour, and could con&s;equently have no
harve&s;ts: they reque&s;ted, that &s;uch of their brethren as were &s;ettled
in A&s;ia, &s;hould be indulged in the &s;ame privileges. Thus, being gratified
in all their de&s;ires, great numbers of them offered to enli&s;t them&s;elves
in his army. Soon after the Samaritans demanded the &s;ame favours; but he gave
them an eva&s;ive an&s;wer, and promi&s;ed to take the matter into
con&s;ideration, upon his return.</P>
<P>From this city he went on to Gaza, where he found a more ob&s;tinate
re&s;i&s;tance than he had expected; but at length taking the town by &s;torm,
and having cut the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of ten thou&s;and men, to pieces,
with brutal fero|city, he ordered Boetis, the governor, to be brought before
him; and having in vain en|deavoured to intimidate him, commanded, at la&s;t,
that holes &s;hould be bored through his heels, and thus to be tied by cords to
the back of his chariot, and in this manner to be dragged round the walls of
the city. This he did in <PB N="217" REF="219"> imitation of Achilles, whom
Homer de&s;cribes as having dragged Hector round the walls of Troy in the
&s;ame manner; but it was reading the poet to very little advantage, to imitate
his hero in the mo&s;t unworthy part of his cha|racter.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Alexander had ended the &s;iege of Gaza, he left a
garri&s;on there, and turned the whole power of his arms towards Egypt. In
&s;even days march he arrived before Pelu&s;ium, whither a great number of
Egyptians had a&s;|&s;embled, with all imaginable diligence, to own him for
their &s;overeign; being heartily di&s;plea&s;ed with the Per&s;ian government,
as likewi&s;e the Per&s;ian governors; as the one de&s;troyed their liberty,
the other ridiculed their religion. Ma&s;aeus, the Per&s;ian governor, who
commanded in Memphis, finding it would be to no purpo&s;e for him to re&s;i&s;t
&s;o triumphant an army, and that Darius, his &s;overeign, was not in a
con|dition to &s;uccour him, &s;et open the gates of the city to the conqueror,
and gave up eight hundred talents, (about one hundred and forty thou&s;and
pounds) and all the king's furniture. Thus Alexander po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf of all Egypt, without meeting with the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>He now therefore formed a de&s;ign of vi&s;iting the temple of
Jupiter. This temple was &s;ituated <PB N="218" REF="220"> at a di&s;tance of
twelve days journey from Memphis, in the mid&s;t of the &s;andy de&s;arts of
Lybia. Alexander having read in Homer, and other fabulous authors of antiquity,
that mo&s;t of the heroes were repre&s;ented as the &s;ons of &s;ome deity, was
willing him&s;elf to pa&s;s for a hero, and knew that he could bribe the
prie&s;ts to compliment him, as of cele&s;tial origin. Setting out therefore
along the river Memphis, and after having pa&s;&s;ed Canopus, oppo&s;ite the
i&s;land of Pharos, he there laid the foundation of the city of Alexandria,
which in a little time became one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing towns for
commerce in the world. From thence he had a journey of three hundred and forty
miles to the temple of Jupiter; the way leading through inho&s;pitable
de&s;arts, and plains of &s;and. The &s;oldiers were patient enough for the two
fir&s;t days march, before they arrived amid&s;t the dreadful &s;olitudes; but
as &s;oon as they found them&s;elves in va&s;t plains, covered with &s;ands of
a prodigious depth, they were greatly ter|rified. Surrounded as with a &s;ea,
they gazed round as far as their &s;ight could extend, to di&s;cover if
po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome place that was in|habited; but all in vain, for they could
not perceive &s;o much as a &s;ingle tree, nor the lea&s;t foot&s;teps of any
land that had been cultivated. <PB N="219" REF="221"> To increa&s;e their
calamity, the water that they had brought in goat-&s;kins, upon camels, now
failed, and there was not &s;o much as a &s;ingle drop in all that &s;andy
de&s;art. They were however greatly refre&s;hed by the accidental falling of a
&s;hower, which &s;erved to encourage them in their progre&s;s, till they came
to the temple of the Deity. Nothing can be more fanciful than the de&s;cription
the hi&s;torians have given us of this gloomy retreat: it is repre&s;ented as a
&s;mall &s;pot of fertile ground, in the mid&s;t of va&s;t &s;olitudes of
&s;and; it is covered with the thicke&s;t trees, that exclude the rays of the
&s;un; and watered with &s;everal &s;prings, which pre|&s;erved it in perpetual
verdure; near the grove where the temple &s;tood was the Fountain of the Sun,
which at day-break was luke-warm, at noon cold, then towards evening
in&s;en&s;ibly grew warmer, and was boiling hot at midnight. The god
wor&s;hipped in this place, had his &s;tatue made of emeralds, and other
precious &s;tones: and from the head to the navel re|&s;embled a ram. No
&s;ooner had Alexander appeared before the altar, than the high prie&s;t
declared him to be the &s;on of Jupiter; the conqueror quite intoxicated with
adulation, a&s;ked, Whether he &s;hould have &s;ucce&s;s in his expedition; the
prie&s;t an&s;wered, That he &s;hould <PB N="220" REF="222"> be monarch of the
world: the conqueror en|quired, If his father's murderers were puni&s;hed; the
prie&s;t replied, That his father Jupiter was immortal, but that the murderers
of Philip had been all extirpated.</P>
<P>Alexander having ended his &s;acrifice, and rewarded the prie&s;ts,
who had been &s;o liberal of their titles, from that time &s;uppo&s;ed
him&s;elf or would have it &s;uppo&s;ed, that he was the &s;on of Jupiter. Upon
his return from the temple, and during his &s;tay in Egypt, he &s;ettled the
government of that country upon the mo&s;t &s;olid foundation; he divided it
into di&s;tricts, over each of which he appointed a lieutenant, who re|ceived
orders from him&s;elf alone. And thus having &s;ettled affairs there, he &s;et
out, in the beginning of &s;pring, to march again&s;t Darius<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> who was now preparing to oppo&s;e him.
He made &s;ome &s;tay at Tyre, to &s;ettle the various affairs of the countries
he had left behind; and advanced towards new conque&s;ts. On his march<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the wife of Darius died in child-bed, and wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> honoured with a funeral ceremony, due
to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> exalted character. He
continued his journey towards the Tygris, where he at la&s;t expected to come
up with the enemy, and to &s;trik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
one blow, which &s;hould decide the fate o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> nations.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="223"> Darius had already made overtures of peace to
him twice; but finding at la&s;t that there were no hopes of their concluding
one, unle&s;s he re&s;igned the whole empire to him, prepared him&s;elf again
for battle. For this purpo&s;e, he a&s;&s;embled in Babylon an army half as
numerous again as that at I&s;&s;us, and marched it towards Nineveh. His forces
co|vered all the plains of Me&s;opotamia. Advice being brought that the enemy
was not far off, he cau&s;ed Satropates, colonel of the cavalry, to advance at
the head of a thou&s;and cho&s;en hor&s;e; and likewi&s;e gave &s;ix thou&s;and
to Ma|&s;aeus, governor of the province; all whom were to prevent Alexander
from cro&s;&s;ing the river, and to lay wa&s;te the country through which that
monarch was to pa&s;s. But he arrived too late.</P>
<P>The Tygris is the mo&s;t rapid river of all the ea&s;t; and it was
with &s;ome difficulty that Alex|ander's &s;oldiers were able to &s;tem the
current, carrying their arms over their heads. The king walked on foot among
the infantry, and pointed out with his hand the pa&s;&s;age to his &s;oldiers:
he commanded them, with a loud voice, To &s;ave nothing but their arms; and let
their baggage that retarded them in the water, float away with the &s;tream. At
length <PB N="222" REF="224"> they were drawn up in battle-array on the
oppo&s;ite &s;hore; and encamped two days near the river, &s;till prepared for
action. An eclip&s;e of the moon, which happened about that time, gave
Alexander's &s;oldiers great unea|&s;ine&s;s; but he brought forward &s;ome
Egyptian &s;ooth&s;ayers, who a&s;&s;ured the army, That the moon portended
calamities not to the Greeks, but the Per&s;ians. By this artifice the hopes
and the courage of the &s;oldiers being revived once more, the king led them on
to meet the enemy, and began his march at midnight. On his right hand lay the
Tygris, and on his left the Gordylean mountains. At break of day, news was
brought, that Darius was but twenty miles from the place they then were. All
things now therefore threatened an approaching battle; when Darius, who had
already twice &s;ued for peace, &s;ent new conditions, &s;till more
advantageous than the former. But Alexander refu&s;ed his offers; proudly
replying, That the world would not permit two &s;uns nor two &s;overeigns. Thus
all negociation being at an end, both &s;ides prepared for battle; equally
irritated, and equally ambitious. Darius pitched his camp near a village called
Gangamila, and the river Bumila, in a plain at a con&s;i|derable di&s;tance
from Arbela. He had before <PB N="223" REF="225"> levelled the &s;pot, which he
pitched upon for the field of battle, in order that his chariots and cavalry
might have full room to move in; that his fighting in the &s;treights of
Cilicia, had lo&s;t him the battle fought there.</P>
<P>Alexander upon hearing this news, continued four days in the place
he then was to re&s;t his army, and &s;urrounded his camp with trenches and
palli&s;adoes; for he was determined to leave all his baggage, and the
u&s;ele&s;s &s;oldiers in it, and march the remainder again&s;t the enemy, with
no other equipage than the arms they car|ried. Accordingly he &s;et out about
nine in the evening, in order to fight Darius at day break; who, upon this
advice had drawn up his army in order of battle. Alexander al&s;o marched in
battle-array; for both armies were within two or three leagues of each other.
When he was arrived at the mountains, where he could di&s;|cover the enemy's
army, he halted; and having a&s;&s;embled his general officers, as well
Macedo|nians as foreigners, he debated whether they &s;hould engage
immediately, or pitch their camp in that place. The latter opinion being
fol|lowed, becau&s;e it was judged proper for them to view the field of battle,
and the manner in which the enemy was drawn up, the army en|camped in the
&s;ame order in which it had <PB N="224" REF="226"> marched; during which
Alexander at the head of his infantry lightly armed, and his royal regi|ments,
marched round the plain in which the battle was to be fought.</P>
<P>Being returned, he a&s;&s;embled his general of|ficers a &s;econd
time, and told them, that there was no occa&s;ion for making a &s;peech,
becau&s;e their courage and great actions were alone &s;uf|ficient to excite
them to glory; and he de&s;ired them only to repre&s;ent to the &s;oldiers,
that they were not to fight on this occa&s;ion for Phoenicia or Aegypt, but for
all A&s;ia, which would be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him who &s;hould conquer; and
tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> after having gone through &s;o
many provinces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and left behind them
&s;o great a number of ri+vers and mountains; they could &s;ecure their
re+treat no otherwi&s;e, than by gaining a complea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> victory. After this &s;peech, he ordered them to take
&s;ome repo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid Parmenio advi&s;ed him to attack the enemy in the night
time, alledging, that they might ea&s;ily be defeated, if fallen upon by
&s;ur+prize and in the dark; but the king an&s;wered &s;o loud, that all
pre&s;ent might hear him; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> it
did not become Alexander to &s;teal a victory<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and therefore he was re&s;olved to fight and con+quer in broad day
light. This was a haughty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> but at
the &s;ame time, a prudent an&s;wer; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <PB N="225" REF="227"> it was running great hazard, to fall upon
&s;o numerous an army in the night time and in an unknown country. Darius
fearing he &s;hould be attacked at unawares, becau&s;e he had not intrenched
him&s;elf, obliged his &s;oldiers to con|tinue the whole night under arms,
which prov|ed of the highe&s;t prejudice to him in the en|gagement. In the mean
time Alexander went to bed to repo&s;e him&s;elf the remaining part of the
night. As he revolved in his mind, not without &s;ome emotion, the
con&s;equence of the battle, which was upon the point of being fought, he could
not &s;leep immediately. But his body being oppre&s;&s;ed in a manner by the
anxiety of his mind, he &s;lept &s;oundly the whole night, contrary to his
u&s;ual cu&s;tom, &s;o that when his generals were a&s;&s;embled at day-break
before his tent, to receive his orders, they were greatly &s;urprized to find
he was not awake; upon which they them&s;elves commanded the &s;oldiers to take
&s;ome refre&s;hment. Parmenio having at la&s;t awaked him, and &s;eeming
&s;urprized to &s;ind him in &s;o calm and &s;weet a &s;leep, ju&s;t as he was
going to fight a battle in which his whole fortune lay at &s;take, How could it
be po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid Alexander, for me not to be calm, &s;ince the enemy is
coming to deliver him&s;elf into my hands? Upon this he immediately took up his
<PB N="226" REF="228"> arms, mounted his hor&s;e, and rode up and down the
ranks, exhorting the troops to behave gal|lantly, and if po&s;&s;ible, to
&s;urpa&s;s their-ancient fame, and the glory they had hitherto acquired.</P>
<P>There was a great difference between the two armies in re&s;pect to
numbers, but much more with regard to courage. That of Darius con|&s;i&s;ted at
lea&s;t of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and foot and forty thou&s;and hor&s;e; and the
other of no more than forty thou&s;and foot, and &s;even or eight thou&s;and
hor&s;e, but the latter was all fire and &s;trength; whereas on the &s;ide of
the Per&s;ians it was a prodigious a&s;&s;emblage of men, not of &s;oldiers; an
empty phantom rather than a real army. Both &s;ides were di&s;po&s;ed in very
near the &s;ame array. The forces were drawn up in two lines, the cavalry on
the two wings, and the infantry in the middle; the one and the other being
under the particular conduct of the chiefs of each of the different nations
that com|po&s;ed them; and commanded in general, by the principal crown
officers. The front of the battle (under Darius) was covered with two hundred
chariots, armed with &s;cythes, and with fifteen elephants, that king taking
his po&s;t in the center of the fir&s;t line. Be&s;ides the guards which were
the flower of his forces, he al&s;o had fortified him&s;elf with the Grecian
infantry, <PB N="227" REF="229"> whom he had drawn up near his per&s;on,
believ|ing this body only capable of oppo&s;ing the Ma|cedonian phalanx. As his
army &s;pread over a much greater &s;pace of ground, than that of the enemy, he
intended to &s;urround and to charge them at one and the &s;ame time, both in
front and flank, which from Alexander's di&s;po&s;ition, he &s;oon after found
impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Darius being afraid le&s;t the Macedonians &s;hould draw him from
the &s;pot of ground he had levelled, and carry him into another that was rough
and uneven, commanded the cavalry in his left wing, which &s;pread much farther
than that of the enemy's right, to march direct|ly forward, and wheel about
upon the Mace|donians in flank, to prevent them from extend|ing their troops
farther. Upon which Alexander di&s;patched again&s;t them the body of hor&s;e
in his &s;ervice, commanded by Menidas; but as the&s;e were not able to make
head again&s;t the enemy, becau&s;e of their prodigious numbers, he rein|forced
them with the Paeonians, whom Aretas commanded, and with the foreign cavalry.
Be|&s;ides the advantage of numbers, the Per&s;ians had that al&s;o of coats of
mail, which &s;ecured them|&s;elves and their hor&s;es much more, and by which
Alexander's cavalry was prodigiou&s;ly annoyed. However, the Macedonians
marched to the <PB N="228" REF="230"> charge with great bravery, and at la&s;t
put the enemy to flight.</P>
<P>Upon this the Per&s;ians oppo&s;ed the chariots armed with &s;cythes
again&s;t the Macedonian phalanx, in order to break it, but with little
&s;ucce&s;s. The noi&s;e which the &s;oldiers, who were lightly armed, made by
&s;triking their &s;words again&s;t their bucklers, and the arrows which flew
on all &s;ides, frighted the hor&s;es, and made a great number of them turn
back again&s;t their own troops. Others laying hold of the hor&s;es bridles,
pulled the riders down and cut them to pieces. Part of the chariots drove
between the battalions, which opened to make way for them as they had been
ordered to do, by which means they did little or no execution.</P>
<P>Alexander &s;eeing Darius &s;et his whole army in motion, in order
to charge him, employed a &s;tratagem to encourage his &s;oldiers. When the
battle was at the hotte&s;t, and the Macedonians were in the greate&s;t danger,
Ari&s;tander the &s;ooth&s;ayer, clothed in his white robes, holding a branch
of lawrel in his hand, advances among the combatants as he had been
in&s;tructed by the king; and crying, that he &s;aw an eagle hover|ing over
Alexander's head (a &s;ure omen of vic|tory) he &s;hewed with his finger, the
pretended bird to the &s;oldiers; who relying upon the &s;in|cerity 
<PB N="229" REF="231"> of the &s;ooth&s;ayer, fancied they al&s;o &s;aw it; and
thereupon renewed the attack with greater chearfulne&s;s and ardour than ever.
Alex|ander now pre&s;&s;ed to the place in which Darius was &s;tationed, and
the pre&s;ence of the two op|po&s;ing kings in&s;pired both &s;ides with
vigour. Darius was mounted on a chariot, and Alex|ander on hor&s;eback; both
&s;urrounded with their brave&s;t officers and &s;oldiers, who&s;e only
endea|vours were to &s;ave the lives of their re&s;pective princes at the
hazard of their own. The battle was ob&s;tinate and bloody. Alexander having
wounded Darius's equerry, with a javelin, the Per&s;ians as well as Macedonians
imagined that the king was killed; upon which the former, breaking aloud into
the mo&s;t di&s;mal &s;ounds, the whole army was &s;eized with the greate&s;t
con|&s;ternation. The relations of Darius, who were at his left hand, fled away
with the guards, and &s;o abandoned the chariot; but tho&s;e who were at his
right, took him into the center of their body. Hi&s;torians relate, that this
prince hav|ing drawn his &s;cymetar, reflected whether he ought not to lay
violent hands upon him&s;elf, rather than fly in an ignominious manner. But
perceiving from his chariot, that his &s;oldiers &s;till fought, he was
a&s;hamed to for&s;ake them; and as divided between hope and de&s;pair, the 
<PB N="230" REF="232"> Per&s;ians retired in&s;en&s;ibly and thinned their
ranks, when it could no longer be called a battle, but a &s;laughter. Then
Darius turning about his chariot, fled with the re&s;t; and the conqueror was
now wholly employed in pur|&s;uing him. But in the mean time, finding that the
left wing of his army, which was commanded by Parmenio, was in great danger,
Alexander was obliged to de&s;i&s;t from pur&s;uing Darius, whom he had
almo&s;t overtaken, and wheeled round to attack the Per&s;ian hor&s;e, that,
after plundering the camp, were retiring in good order; them he cut in pieces;
and the &s;cale of battle turning in favour of the Macedonians, a total rout of
the Per&s;ians en&s;ued. The pur&s;uit was warm, and the &s;laughter amazing:
Alexander rode as far as Arbela after Darius; every moment hoping to come up
with that monarch: he had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed through when Alexander arrived, but
he left his trea&s;ure, with his bow and &s;hield, as a prey to the enemy.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ucce&s;s of this famous battle, which gave empire to
the conqueror. Ac|cording to Arrian, the Per&s;ians lo&s;t three hundred
thou&s;and men, be&s;ides tho&s;e who were taken pri&s;oners; which at lea&s;t
is a proof that the lo&s;s was very great on their &s;ide. That 
<PB N="231" REF="233"> of Alexander's was very incon&s;iderable; he not
lo&s;ing, according to the la&s;t mentioned author, above twelve hundred men,
mo&s;t of whom were hor&s;e. This engagement was fought in the month of
October, about the &s;ame time, that two years before, the battle of I&s;us was
fought. As Gangamela, in A&s;&s;yria, the &s;pot where the two armies engaged,
was a &s;mall place of very little note, this was called the battle of Arbela,
that city being neare&s;t to the field of battle.</P>
<P>Darius, after this dreadful defeat, rode to|wards the river Lycus,
with a very few attend|ants; he was advi&s;ed to break down the bridges to
&s;ecure his retreat; but he refu&s;ed, &s;aying, He would not &s;ave his life,
at the expence of thou&s;ands of his &s;ubjects. After riding a great number of
miles full &s;peed, he arrived, at midnight, at Arbela; from thence he fled
to|wards Media, over the Armenian mountains, followed by his &s;atraps, and a
few of his guards, expecting the wor&s;t, de&s;pairing of fortune, a wretched
&s;urvivor of his country's ruin.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Alexander approached near Babylon; and Mazaeus the
governor, who had retired thither after the battle of Arbela, 
<PB N="232" REF="234"> &s;urrendered it to him without &s;triking a blow.
Alexander therefore entered the city, at the head of his whole army, as if he
had been marching to a battle. The walls of Babylon were lined with people,
notwith&s;tanding the greate&s;t part of the citizens were gone out before,
from the impatient de&s;ire they had to &s;ee their new &s;overeign, who&s;e
renown had far out&s;tripped his march. Bagophanes, governor of the fortre&s;s,
and guardian of the trea&s;ure, unwilling to di&s;cover le&s;s zeal than
Mazaeus, &s;trewed the &s;treets with flowers, and rai&s;ed on both &s;ides of
the way &s;ilver altars, which &s;moaked not only with frankincen&s;e, but the
mo&s;t fragrant perfumes of every kind. La&s;t of all came the pre&s;ents which
were to be made to the king; <HI>viz.</HI> herds of cattle, and a great number
of hor&s;es; as al&s;o lions and panthers, which were carried in cages. After
the&s;e the Magi walked, &s;inging hymns after the manner of their country;
then the Chaldeans, ac|companied by the Babyloni&s;h &s;ooth&s;ayers and
mu&s;icians. The rear was brought up by the Babyloni&s;h cavalry; of which,
both men and hor&s;es were &s;o &s;umptuous, that imagination can &s;carce
reach their magnificence. The king cau&s;ed the people to walk after the
infantry, <PB N="233" REF="235"> and him&s;elf, &s;urrounded with his guards,
and &s;eated on a chariot, entered the city, and from thence rode to the
palace, as in a kind of triumph. The next day he took a view of all Darius's
money and moveables, which amounted to incredible &s;ums, and which he
di&s;tributed with genero&s;ity among his &s;oldiers. He gave the government of
the province to Mazaeus; and the command of the forces he left there, to
Apollodorus of Amphipolis.</P>
<P>From Rabylon Alexander marched to the province of Syraceni,
afterwards to Su&s;a, where he arrived after a march of twenty days, and found
trea&s;ures to an infinite amount. The&s;e al&s;o he applied to the purpo&s;es
of rewarding merit and courage among his troops. In this city he left the
mother and children of Darius; and from thence he went forward, till he came to
a river called, Pa&s;itigris. Having cro&s;&s;ed it, with nine thou&s;and foot,
and three thou&s;and hor&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of Agrians, as well as of Gre|cian
mercenaries, and a reinforcement of three thou&s;and Thracians, he entered the
country of Uxii. This region lies near Su&s;a, and extends to the frontiers of
Per&s;ia; a narrow pa&s;s only lying between it and Su&s;iana. Madathes
commanded this province. He was not a time-&s;erver, nor a follower of fortune;
but <PB N="234" REF="236"> faithful to his &s;overeign; he re&s;olved to hold
out to the la&s;t extremity; and for this purpo&s;e, had withdrawn into his own
city, which &s;tood in the mid&s;t of craggy rocks, and was &s;urrounded with
precipices. Having been forced from thence, he retired into the citadel, whence
the be&s;ieged &s;ent thirty deputies to Alexander, to &s;ue for quarter, which
they obtained at la&s;t, by the interpo&s;ition of Sy&s;igambis. The king not
only pardoned Madathes, who was a near re|lation of that prince&s;s, but
likewi&s;e &s;et all the captives, and tho&s;e who had &s;urrendered
them|&s;elves, at liberty, permitted them to enjoy their &s;everal rights and
privileges, would not &s;uffer the city to be plundered, but let them plough
their lands, without paying any tribute. From thence he pa&s;&s;ed on to the
pa&s;s of Su&s;a, defended by mountains almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, and by
Ariobarzanes, with a body of five thou&s;and men; he there &s;topped for a
while, but being led by a different rout among the mountains, he came over the
pa&s;s and &s;o cut the army that defended it in pieces.</P>
<P>Alexander, from an effect of the good for|tune which con&s;tantly
attended him in all his undertakings, having extricated him&s;elf hap|pily out
of the danger to which he was &s;o lately expo&s;ed, marched immediately
towards <PB N="235" REF="237"> Per&s;ia. Being on the road, he received letters
from Tiridates, governor of Per&s;epolis, which informed him, that the
inhabitants of that city, upon the report of his advancing towards him, were
determined to plunder Darius's trea&s;ures, with which he was intru&s;ted; and
therefore, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to make all the ha&s;te imaginable
to &s;eize them him&s;elf; that he had only the Araxes to cro&s;s, after which
the road was &s;mooth and ea&s;y. Alexander, upon this news, leaving his
infantry behind, marched the whole night at the head of his cavalry, who were
very much harra&s;&s;ed by the length and &s;wiftne&s;s of his march, and
pa&s;&s;ed the Araxes, on a bridge, which, by his order, had been but &s;ome
days before.</P>
<P>But as he drew near the city, he perceived a large body of men, who
exhibited a memorable example of the greate&s;t mi&s;ery. The&s;e were about
four thou&s;and Greeks, very far advanced in years, who having been made
pri&s;oners of war, had &s;uffered all the torments which the Per&s;ian tyranny
could inflict. The hands of &s;ome had been cut off, the feet of others; and
others again had lo&s;t their no&s;es and ears. They appeared like &s;o many
&s;hadows, rather than like men; &s;peech being almo&s;t the only thing by
which they were known to be &s;uch. <PB N="236" REF="238"> Alexander could not
refrain from tears at this &s;ight; and as they irre&s;i&s;tably brought him to
commi&s;erate their condition, he bade them, with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s,
not to de&s;pond; and a&s;&s;ured them, that they &s;hould again &s;ee their
wives and country. They cho&s;e, however, to remain in a place where misfortune
now be|came habitual; wherefore he rewarded them li|berally for their
&s;ufferings, and commanded the governor of the province to treat them with
mildne&s;s and re&s;pect. The day following he en|tered the city of
Per&s;epolis, at the head of his victorious &s;oldiers; who, though the
inhabitants made no re&s;i&s;tance, began to cut in pieces all tho&s;e who
&s;till remained in the city. However, the king &s;oon put an end to the
ma&s;&s;acre, and forbid his &s;oldiers further violence. The riches he had
found in other places, were but trifling, when compared to tho&s;e he found
here. This however, did not &s;ave the city; for being one day at a banquet
among his friends, and hap|pening to drink to exce&s;s, the conver&s;ation ran
upon the various cruelties exerci&s;ed by the Per&s;ians in Greece,
particularly at Athens Thais, an Athenian courtezan, urged the pu|&s;illanimity
of not taking revenge for &s;uch re|peated &s;laughters. All the gue&s;ts
applauded the di&s;cour&s;e; when immediately the king ro&s;e from 
<PB N="237" REF="239"> table (his head being crowned with flowers), and taking
a torch in his hand, he advanced forward, to execute his mad exploit. The whole
company followed him, breaking into loud acclamations, and, after &s;inging and
dancing, &s;urrounded the palace. All the re&s;t of the Macedonians, at this
noi&s;e, ran in crowds, with lighted tapers, and &s;et fire to every part of
it. However, Alexander was &s;orry not long after for what he had done; and
thereupon gave orders for extingui&s;hing the fire; but it was too late.</P>
<P>While Alexander was thus triumphing in all the exultation of
&s;ucce&s;s, the wretched Darius was by this time arrived at Ecbatana, the
ca|pital of Media. There remained &s;till with this fugitive prince thirty
thou&s;and foot; among whom were four thou&s;and Greeks, that were faithful to
him to the la&s;t: be&s;ides the&s;e he had four thou&s;and &s;lingers, and
upwards of three thou&s;and Bactrian hor&s;e, whom Be&s;&s;us, their go|vernor,
commanded. Darius, even with &s;o &s;mall a force, &s;till conceived hopes of
oppo&s;ing his rival; or at lea&s;t of protracting the war: but he was
&s;urrounded with traitors; his want of &s;ucce&s;s had turned all mankind
again&s;t him; but Nabarzanes, one of the greate&s;t lords of Per&s;ia, and
general of the hor&s;e, had con&s;pired <PB N="238" REF="240"> with Be&s;&s;us,
general of the Bactrians, to commit the blacke&s;t of all crimes, and that was,
to &s;eize upon the per&s;on of the king, and lay him in chains, which they
might ea&s;ily do; as each of them had a great number of &s;ol|diers under his
command. Their de&s;ign was, if Alexander &s;hould pur&s;ue them, to &s;ecure
them&s;elves, by giving up Darius alive into his hands; and, in ca&s;e they
e&s;caped, to murder that prince, and afterwards u&s;urp his crown, and begin a
new war. The&s;e traitors &s;oon won over the troops, by repre&s;enting to
them, that they were going to their de&s;truction; that they would &s;oon be
cru&s;hed under the ruins of an empire, which was ju&s;t ready to fall, at the
&s;ame time that Bactriana was open to them, and offered them immen&s;e riches.
The&s;e promi&s;es &s;oon prevailed upon the per|fidious army; the traitors
&s;eized, and bound their monarch in chains of gold, under the appearance of
honour, as he was a king; then enclo&s;ing him in a covered chariot, they &s;et
out towards Bactriana. In this man|ner they carried him, with the utmo&s;t
di&s;|patch; until being informed that the Grecian army was &s;till hotly
pur&s;uing them, they found it impo&s;&s;ible either to conciliate the
friend&s;hip of Alexander, or to &s;ecure a throne for them|&s;elves: 
<PB N="239" REF="241"> they therefore once more gave Darius his liberty, and
de&s;ired him to make the be&s;t of his e&s;cape with them from the conqueror;
but he replied, That the gods were ready to revenge the evils he had already
&s;uffered; and, appeal|ing to Alexander for ju&s;tice, refu&s;ed to follow a
band of traitors. At the&s;e words they fell into the utmo&s;t fury,
thru&s;ting him with their darts and their &s;pears, and left him to linger in
this manner, unattended, the remains of his wretch|ed life. The traitors then
made their e&s;cape dif|ferent ways; while the victorious Macedonians at length
coming up, found Darius in a &s;oli|tude, lying in his chariot, and drawing
near his end. However, he had &s;trength enough before he died, to call for
drink; which a Macedonian, Poly&s;tratus by name, brought him. He had a
Per&s;ian pri&s;oner, whom he employed as his interpreter. Darius, after
drinking the liquor that had been given him, turned to the Mace|donian, and
&s;aid, That in the deplorable &s;tate to which he was reduced, he however
&s;hould have the comfort to &s;peak to one who could under&s;tand him; and
that his la&s;t words would not be lo&s;t. He therefore charged him to tell
Alexander, That he had died in his debt, that he gave him many thanks, for the
great hu|manity he had exerci&s;ed towards his mother, <PB N="240" REF="242">
his wife, and his children, who&s;e lives he had not only &s;pared, but
re&s;tored to their former &s;plendor: that he be&s;ought the gods to give
victory to his arms, and make him monarch of the univer&s;e; that he thought he
need not intreat him to revenge the execrable murder commited on his per&s;on,
as this was the common cau&s;e of kings.</P>
<P> After this, taking Poly&s;tratus by the hand, 
<Q REND="inline">"Give him," &s;aid he, "thy hand, as I give thee
mine; and carry him, in my name, the only pledge I am able to give of my
grati|tude and affections:"</Q> &s;aying the&s;e words, he breathed his
la&s;t.</P>
<P>Alexander coming up a moment after, and &s;eeing Darius's body, he
wept bitterly; and by the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timonies of affection that could
be given, proved how intimately he was affected with the unhappine&s;s of a
prince who de&s;erved a better fate. He immediately pulled off his military
cloak, and threw it on Darius's body; then cau&s;ing it to be embalmed, and his
coffin to be adorned with royal magnificence, he &s;ent it to Sy&s;igambis, to
be interred with the honours u&s;ually paid to the decea&s;ed Per&s;ian
monarchs, and entombed with his ance&s;tors. Thus died Darius, in the fiftieth
year of his age; &s;ix of which he reigned with felicity: in him 
<PB N="241" REF="243"> the Per&s;ian empire ended, after having exi&s;ted, from
the time of Cyrus the Great, a period of two hundred and ninety-nine years.</P>
<P>The death of Darius only &s;erved to inflame the &s;pirit of
ambition in Alexander to pur&s;ue further conque&s;ts. After having in vain
at|tempted to pur&s;ue Be&s;&s;us, who now a&s;&s;umed the name of king, he
de&s;i&s;ted, in order to cro&s;s Parthia; and in three days arrived on the
frontiers of Hyrcania, which &s;ubmitted to his arms. He afterwards &s;ubdued
the Mandii, the Arii, the Drangae, the Aracho&s;ii, and &s;everal other
nations; into which his army marched with greater &s;peed, than people
ge|nerally travel. He frequently would pur&s;ue an enemy for whole days and
nights together; almo&s;t without &s;uffering his troops to take any re&s;t. By
this prodigious rapidity, he came unawares upon nations who thought him at a
great di&s;tance; and &s;ubdued them, before they had time to put them&s;elves
in a po&s;ture of defence.</P>
<P>It was upon one of the&s;e excur&s;ions that Thale&s;tris, queen of
the Amazons, came to pay him a vi&s;it. A violent de&s;ire of &s;eeing
Alexander, had prompted that prince&s;s to leave her dominions, and travel
through a great number of countries to gratify her curio&s;ity. 
<PB N="242" REF="244"> Being come pretty near his camp, &s;he &s;ent word, That
a queen was come to vi&s;it him; and that &s;he had a prodigious inclination to
cultivate his acquaintance; and accordingly was arrived within a little
di&s;tance from that place. Alexander having returned a favour|able an&s;wer,
&s;he commanded her train to &s;top, and her&s;elf came forward, with three
hundred women; and the moment &s;he perceived the king, &s;he leaped from her
hor&s;e, having two lances in her right hand. She looked upon the king without
di&s;covering the lea&s;t &s;ign of admiration, and &s;urveying him
attentively, did not think his &s;tature an&s;werable to his fame; for the
Barbarians are very much &s;truck with a maje&s;tic air; and think tho&s;e only
capable of mighty atchievements, on whom nature has be&s;towed bodily
advantages. She did not &s;cruple to tell him that the chief motive of her
journey was to have po&s;terity by him; adding, that &s;he was worthy of giving
heirs to his empire. Alexander, upon this reque&s;t, was obliged to make &s;ome
&s;tay in this place; after which, Thale&s;tris returned to her kingdom, and
the king into the province inhabited by the Parthians.</P>
<P>Alexander now enjoying a little repo&s;e, aban|dones him&s;elf to
&s;en&s;uality, and he whom the <PB N="243" REF="245"> arms of the Per&s;ians
could not conquer, fell a victim to their vices. Nothing was now to be &s;een
but games, parties of plea&s;ure, women and exce&s;&s;ive fea&s;ting; in which
he u&s;ed to revel whole days and nights. Not &s;atisfied with the buffoons,
and the performers on in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, whom he had brought with him out
of Greece, he obliged the captive women, whom he carried along with him, to
&s;ing &s;ongs, after the manner of their country. He happened, among the&s;e
women, to perceive one who appeared in deeper affliction than the re&s;t; and
who, by a mode&s;t, and at the &s;ame time a noble confu&s;ion, di&s;covered a
greater re|luctance than the others to appear in public. She was a perfect
beauty, which was very much heightened by her ba&s;hfulne&s;s; whil&s;t &s;he
threw her eyes to the ground, and did all in her power to conceal her face. The
king &s;oon imagined, by her air and mien, that &s;he was not of vulgar birth,
and enquiring him&s;elf into it, the lady an&s;wered, That &s;he was
grand-daughter to Ochus, who not long before had &s;wayed the Per&s;ian
&s;cepter, and daughter of his &s;on; that &s;he had married Hy&s;ta&s;pes, who
was related to Darius, and general of a great army. Alexander being touched
with compa&s;&s;ion, when he heard the unhappy fate of a prince&s;s 
<PB N="244" REF="246"> of the blood royal, and the &s;ad condition to which
&s;he was reduced, not only gave her liberty, but returned all her
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and cau&s;ed her hu&s;band to be &s;ought for, in order
that &s;he might be re&s;tored to him.</P>
<P>But now the veteran &s;oldiers who had fought under Philip, not
having the lea&s;t idea of &s;en&s;u|ality, inveighed publickly again&s;t the
prodigious luxury, and the numerous vices which the army had learnt in Su&s;a
and Ecbatena. The king therefore thought that the &s;afe&s;t remedy would be to
employ them, and for that pur|po&s;e led them again&s;t Be&s;&s;us. But as the
army was incumbered with booty and an u&s;ele&s;s train of baggage, &s;o that
it could &s;carce move, he fir&s;t cau&s;ed all his own baggage to be carried
into a great &s;quare, and afterwards that of his army (&s;uch things excepted
as were ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary;) then ordered the whole to be carried from
thence in carts to a large plain. Every one was in great pain to know the
meaning of all this; but after he had &s;ent away the hor&s;es, he him&s;elf
&s;et fire to his own things, and com|manded every one to follow his
example.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have &s;een Alexander triumphing by a cour&s;e of
virtue, we are now to behold him &s;wollen up by &s;ucce&s;s, &s;poiled by
flattery and enervated by vices, exhibiting a very <PB N="245" REF="247">
doubtful character, and mixing the tyrant with the hero. A con&s;piracy was
formed again&s;t him by one Dymnus; this was communicated by a Macedonian
&s;oldier to Philotas one of Alexander's favourites. Philotas neglected
di|vulging it to his ma&s;ter; and thus became &s;u&s;pected him&s;elf as being
concerned in the con&s;piracy. Parmenio al&s;o the father of this young
favourite became equally obnoxious, and as the &s;u&s;picion of tyrants is
equally fatal with a conviction, Alexander doomed both to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the night various parties of guards having been
po&s;ted in the &s;everal places nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ome entered the tent of
Phi|lotas, who was then in a deep &s;leep; when &s;tarting from his &s;lumbers,
as they were putting manacles on his hands, he cried, Alas! my &s;overeign, the
inveteracy of my enemies has got the better of your goodne&s;s. After this they
covered his face and brought him to the palace without uttering a &s;ingle
word. His hands were tied behind him, and his head cover|ed with a coar&s;e
worn-out piece of cloth. Lo&s;t to him&s;elf, he did not dare to look up, or
open his lips; but the tears &s;treaming from his eyes, he fainted away in the
arms of the man who held him. As the &s;tanders-by wiped off the tears in which
his face was bathed, recovering <PB N="246" REF="248"> his &s;peech and his
voice by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, he &s;eemed de&s;irous of &s;peaking.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of this interview was, that Phi|lotas &s;hould be put
to the rack. The per&s;ons who pre&s;ided on that occa&s;ion, were his mo&s;t
inveterate enemies, and they made him &s;uffer every kind of torture. Philotas
at fir&s;t di&s;co|vered the utmo&s;t re&s;olution and &s;trength of mind; the
torments he &s;uffered not being able to force from him a &s;ingle word nor
even &s;o much as a &s;igh. But at la&s;t conquered by pain, he confe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to be guilty, named &s;everal accomplices, and even accu&s;ed his own
father. The next day the an&s;wers of Philotas were read in full a&s;&s;embly,
he him&s;elf being pre&s;ent. Upon the whole he was unanimou&s;ly &s;entenced
to die; immediately after which he was &s;toned, according to the cu&s;tom of
Mace|donia, with &s;ome other of the con&s;pirators.</P>
<P>The condemnation of Philotas brought on that of Parmenio: whether it
were that Alex|ander really believed him guilty, or was afraid of the father,
now he had put the &s;on to death. Polydamus one of the lords of the court, was
appointed to &s;ee the execution performed. He had been one of Parmenio's
mo&s;t intimate friends, if we may give that name to courtiers, who affect only
their own fortunes. This was <PB N="247" REF="249"> the very rea&s;on of his
being nominated, becau&s;e no one could &s;u&s;pect, that he was &s;ent with
any &s;uch orders again&s;t Parmenio. He therefore &s;et out for Media, where
that general com|manded the army, and was intru&s;ted with the king's
trea&s;ure, which amounted to an hundred and four&s;core thou&s;and talents,
about twenty &s;even millions &s;terling. Alexander had given him &s;everal
letters for Cleander the king's lieutenant in the province; and for the
prin|cipal officers. Two were for Parmenio; one of them from Alexander, and the
other &s;ealed with Philotas's &s;eal, as if he had been alive, to prevent the
father from harbouring the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion. Polydamus was but eleven days
on his journey, and alighted in the night-time at Cleander's. After having
taken all the precau|tions nece&s;&s;ary, they went together with a great
number of attendants to meet Parmenio, who at this time was walking in a park
of his own. The moment Polydamus &s;pied him, though at a great di&s;tance, he
ran to embrace him with an air of the utmo&s;t joy; and after compli|ments,
intermixed with the &s;tronge&s;t indica|tions of friend&s;hip, had pa&s;&s;ed
on both &s;ides, he gave him Alexander's letter, which opening, and afterwards
that under the name of Phi|lotas, he &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the contents. 
<PB N="248" REF="250"> At that very in&s;tant Cleander thru&s;t a dagger into
his &s;ide, then made another thru&s;t in his throat; and the re&s;t gave him
&s;everal wounds, even after he was dead. He was at the time of his death
three&s;core and ten years of age, and had &s;erved his ma&s;ter with a
fidelity and zeal which in the end was but very ill rewarded.</P>
<P>In order to prevent the ill con&s;equences that might ari&s;e from
the contemplation of the&s;e cruelties, Alexander &s;et out upon his march and
continued to pur&s;ue Be&s;&s;us, upon which occa&s;ion he expo&s;ed him&s;elf
to great hard&s;hips and dangers. Be&s;&s;us however was treated by his
followers in the &s;ame manner he had treated the king his ma&s;ter:
Spitamenes, his chief confi|dant, having formed a con&s;piracy again&s;t him,
&s;eized his per&s;on, put him in chains, forced the royal robes from his back;
and with a chain round his neck, he was delivered up in the mo&s;t ignominious
manner to Alexander. The king cau&s;ed this man to be treated with his u&s;ual
cruelty; after reproaching him for his treachery, and cau&s;ing his no&s;e and
ears to be cut off, he &s;ent him to Ecbatana, there to &s;uffer whatever
puni&s;hment Darius's mother &s;hould think proper to inflict upon him. Four
trees were bent by main force, one towards the other, and to each of the&s;e
trees one of the <PB N="249" REF="251"> limbs of this traitor's body was
fa&s;tened. Af|terwards the&s;e trees being let return to their natural
po&s;ition, they flew back with &s;o much violence, that each tore away the
limb that was fixed to it, and &s;o quartered him.</P>
<P>Thus uniting in his per&s;on at once great cruelty and great
enterprize, Alexander &s;till marched forward in &s;earch of new nations whom
he might &s;ubdue. A city inhabited by the Branchid he totally overturned, and
ma&s;&s;acred all the inhabitants in cool blood, only for be|ing de&s;cended
from &s;ome traiterous Greeks, that had delivered up the trea&s;ures of a
temple with which they had been intru&s;ted. He then ad|vanced to the river
Jaxerthes, where he re|ceived a wound in the leg; from thence he went forward
and took the capital of Sogdiana; he there received an emba&s;&s;y from the
Scy|thians, who lived free and independent, but now &s;ubmitted to him. He then
marched to Cyropolis and be&s;ieged it. This was the la&s;t city of the
Per&s;ian empire, and had been built by Cyrus, after whom it was called, and
taking the place he abandoned it to plunder. In this manner he went on
capriciou&s;ly de&s;troying &s;ome towns and building others, &s;ettling
colonies in &s;ome places, and laying whole provinces wa&s;te at his
plea&s;ure. Among his other projects an <PB N="250" REF="252"> inva&s;ion of
the kingdom of Scythia was one; but the cro&s;&s;ing of the river Jaxerthes was
by no means an ea&s;y ta&s;k; however Alexander being always foremo&s;t in
encountring dangers, led on his troops acro&s;s the &s;tream, which was very
rapid, and gained a &s;ignal victory over the Scythians, who vainly attempted
to oppo&s;e him on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>A &s;trong hold called Petra Oxiani, defended by a garri&s;on of
thirty thou&s;and &s;oldiers, with ammunition and provi&s;ion for two years,
was &s;till con&s;idered as impregnable. However as difficulties only &s;eemed
to excite his ambition, his &s;oldiers &s;caled the cliff, and the barbarians
&s;uppo&s;ing that the whole Macedonian army was got over their heads,
&s;urrendered upon con|dition that their lives &s;hould be &s;pared; but
Alexander forgetting the faith of treaty and the humanity which became a
&s;oldier on this occa&s;ion, cau&s;ed them all to be &s;courged with rods, and
afterwards to be fixed to cro&s;&s;es at the foot of the &s;ame rock.</P>
<P>After this having &s;ubdued the Ma&s;&s;agetae and Dahae, he entered
the province of Bar&s;aria, from thence he advanced to Maracander, and
appointed Clytus governor of that province. This was an old officer who had
fought under Philip, and &s;ignalized him&s;elf on many oc|ca&s;ions. 
<PB N="251" REF="253"> At the battle of the Granicus, as Alexander was fighting
bare-headed and Bo|&s;aces had his arm rai&s;ed, in order to &s;trike him
behind, Clytus covered the king with his &s;hield, and cut off the barbarian's
hand. Hellanice, his &s;i&s;ter, had nur&s;ed Alexander; and he loved her with
as much tenderne&s;s as if &s;he had been his own mother.</P>
<P>This favour however, only advanced Clytus to a po&s;t of greater
danger; one evening at an entertainment, the king after drinking immo|derately,
began to celebrate his own exploits; his boa&s;ting even &s;hocked tho&s;e very
per&s;ons, who knew that he &s;poke truth, but particularly the old generals of
his army, who&s;e admira|tions were ingro&s;&s;ed by the actions of his
fa|ther. Clytus was intoxicated, and turning about to tho&s;e who &s;at below
him at table, quoted to them a pa&s;&s;age from Euripides, but in &s;uch a
manner that the king could only hear his voice, and not the words di&s;tinctly.
The &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age was, That the Greeks had done very wrong in
ordaining, that in the in&s;criptions en|graved on trophies, the names of kings
only &s;hould be mentioned; becau&s;e by the&s;e means, brave men were robbed
of the glory they had purcha&s;ed with their blood. The king &s;u&s;|pecting
Clytus had let drop &s;ome di&s;obliging <PB N="252" REF="254">
expre&s;&s;ions, a&s;ked tho&s;e who &s;at neare&s;t him, what he had &s;aid.
As no one an&s;wered, Clitus, rai&s;ing his voice by degrees, began to relate
the actions of Philip, and his wars in Greece, prefering them to whatever was
doing at that time; which created a great di&s;pute between the young and old
men. Though the king was prodigiou&s;ly vexed in his mind, he never|thele&s;s
&s;tifled his re&s;entment, and &s;eemed to li&s;ten very patiently to all
Clitus &s;poke to his prejudice. It is probable he would have quite
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed his pa&s;&s;ion, had Clitus &s;topped there; but the latter
growing more and more in&s;olent as if determined to exa&s;perate and in|&s;ult
the king, he went &s;uch lengths as to defend Parmenio publickly, and to
a&s;&s;ert, that the de&s;troying of Thebes was but trifling, in com|pari&s;on
of the victory which Philip had gained over the Athenians; and that the old
Macedo|nians, though &s;ometimes un&s;ucce&s;sful, were greatly &s;uperior to
tho&s;e who were &s;o ra&s;h as to de&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P>Alexander telling him that in giving cowar|dice the name of ill
&s;ucce&s;s, he was pleading his own cau&s;e; Clitus ri&s;es up, with his eyes
&s;parkling with wine and anger, 
<Q REND="inline">"It is never|thele&s;s this hand (&s;aid he to him
extending it at the &s;ame time) that &s;aved your life at the 
<PB N="253" REF="255"> battle of Granicus. It is the blood and wounds of
the&s;e very Macedonians who are accu&s;ed of cowardice, that rai&s;ed you to
this grandeur; but the tragical end of Parmenio &s;hews, what reward they and
my&s;elf may ex|pect for all our &s;ervices."</Q> This la&s;t reproach &s;tung
Alexander, however he &s;till re&s;trained his pa&s;&s;ion, and only commanded
him to leave the table. 
<Q REND="inline">"He is in the right (&s;ays Clitus as he ro&s;e up)
not to bear free-born men at his table, who can only tell him truth. He will do
well to pa&s;s his life among barbarians and &s;laves, who will be proud to pay
their adora|tion to his Per&s;ian girdle and his white robe."</Q> But now the
king, no longer able to &s;uppre&s;s his rage, &s;natched a javelin from one of
his guards, and would have killed Clitus on the &s;pot, had not the courtiers
with-held his arm, and Clitus been forced but with great difficulty out of the
hall. However he returned into it that moment by another door, &s;inging with
an air of in&s;olence, ver&s;es reflecting highly on the prince, who &s;eeing
the general near him, &s;truck him with his javelin, and laid him dead at his
feet, crying out at the &s;ame time, go now to Philip, to Parmenio and to
Attalus.</P>
<P>The king had no &s;ooner murthered his faithful &s;ervant than he
perceived the atroci|ou&s;ne&s;s <PB N="254" REF="256"> of the act; he threw
him&s;elf upon the dead body, forced out the javelin and would have de&s;troyed
him&s;elf had he not been prevent|ed by his guards, who &s;eized and carried
him forcibly to his own apartment, where the flat|tery and the per&s;ua&s;ions
of his friends at length &s;erved to alleviate his remor&s;e. In order to
di|vert his melancholy, Alexander having drawn his army out of the garri&s;ons
where they had wintered three months, marched towards a country called Gabana.
In his way he met with a dreadful &s;torm, in which his army &s;uf|fered
greatly; from thence he went into the country of Sacae, which he &s;oon
over-run and laid wa&s;te. Soon after this Axertes one of its monarchs,
received him in his palace, which was adorned with barbarous magnificence. He
had a daughter called Roxana, a young lady who&s;e exqui&s;ite beauty was
heightened by all the charms of wit and good &s;en&s;e. Alexander &s;ound her
charms irre&s;i&s;tible, and made her his wife; covering his pa&s;&s;ion with
the &s;pecious pretence of uniting the two nations in &s;uch bonds as &s;hould
improve their mutual har|mony, by blending their intere&s;ts, and throw|ing
down all di&s;tinctions between the con|querors, and the conquered. This
marriage di&s;plea&s;ed the Macedonians very much, and <PB N="255" REF="257">
exa&s;perated his chief courtiers, when it was &s;een that he made one of his
&s;laves his father-in-law. But as, after his murdering Clitus, no one dared to
&s;peak to him with freedom, they applauded what he did with their eyes and
countenances, for they had nothing el&s;e left that was free.</P>
<P>Alexander having thus conquered all the Per&s;ian provinces, now
with boundle&s;s ambi|tion re&s;olved upon a perilous march into India. This
country was con&s;idered as the riche&s;t in the world, not only in gold but in
pearls and preci|ous &s;tones; with which the inhabitants adorned them&s;elves;
but being willing either to impre&s;s his &s;oldiers with an idea of his
authority, or to imitate the barbarians in the magnificence of their titles, he
was re&s;olved not only to be called, but to be believed the &s;on of Jupiter;
as if it had been po&s;&s;ible for him to command as ab&s;olutely over the mind
as over the tongue, and that the Macedonians would conde&s;cend to fall
pro&s;trate and adore him after the Per&s;ian manner.</P>
<P>To &s;ooth and cheri&s;h the&s;e ridiculous pre|ten&s;ions, there
were not wanting flatterers, tho&s;e common pe&s;ts of a court, who are more
dangerous to princes than the arrows of their enemies. But the Macedonians
indeed would <PB N="256" REF="258"> not &s;toop to this ba&s;e adulation; all
of them to a man, refu&s;ing to vary in any manner, from the cu&s;toms of their
country. Among the number who di&s;dained to offer the&s;e ba&s;e adu|lations,
was Calli&s;thenes the philo&s;opher; but his integrity co&s;t him his life; he
was accu&s;ed of being privy to a con&s;piracy formed by Her|molaus a young
officer, upon the life of the king, and for this rea&s;on he was thrown into a
dungeon and loaded with irons, he &s;oon found that he had no mercy to expect;
the mo&s;t grievous tortures were inflicted upon him, in order to extort a
confe&s;&s;ion of guilt, but he per&s;i&s;ted in his innocence to the la&s;t,
and ex|pired in the mid&s;t of his torments.</P>
<P>The kingdom of India for which Alexander now &s;et out was an
exten&s;ive territory, which has been u&s;ually divided into two
parts.&mdash;India on this &s;ide and India on the other &s;ide of the Ganges.
All the Indians at that time were free, nor even did they adopt the ba&s;e
cu&s;tom of the Greeks, in purcha&s;ing &s;laves to do the common offices of
life. The people of that country were then divided into &s;even cla&s;&s;es;
the fir&s;t and mo&s;t honourable, though the &s;malle&s;t, were the guardians
of religion; the &s;econd and the great|e&s;t, was that of the hu&s;bandman,
who&s;e only employment was to cultivate the ground; the <PB N="257" REF="259">
third was that of herd&s;men and &s;hepherds, who led the herds and flocks
among the mountains; the fourth con&s;i&s;ted of trade&s;men and mer|chants,
among whom pilots and &s;eamen were included; the fifth was of &s;oldiers,
who&s;e only employment was war; the &s;ixth was of ma|gi&s;trates, who
&s;uperintended the actions of others, either in cities or in the country, and
reported the whole to the king; the &s;eventh cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of
per&s;ons employed in the pub|lick councils, and who &s;hared the cares of
go|vernment with their &s;overeign; the&s;e orders of &s;tate never blended nor
intermarried with each other, none of the&s;e were permitted to follow two
profe&s;&s;ions at the &s;ame time, nor quit one cla&s;s for another.</P>
<P>Alexander having entered India, all the petty kings of the country
came to meet him and make their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions. On his march he took the
city of Ny&s;a, he then marched to|wards Daedala and di&s;per&s;ed his army
over the whole country, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it without
re&s;i&s;tance. He afterwards went forward to|wards the city of Hago&s;a, which
after being be|&s;ieged in form, &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. The rock of
Aornos, which was deemed inac|ce&s;&s;ible and which it was &s;aid Hercules
him&s;elf was not able to take, but the garri&s;on in a panic 
<PB N="258" REF="260"> delivered it up to his army. From thence he marched to
Acle&s;limus, and after a march of &s;ixteen days, arrived on the banks of the
great river Indus, where he found that Hephe&s;tion had got all things ready
for his pa&s;&s;age, pur|&s;uant to the orders he had before received. Here he
was met by Omphis a king of the country, who did homage to Alexander, and made
him a pre&s;ent of fifty-&s;ix elephants, and other animals of prodigious
&s;ize. The amba&s;|&s;adors from Abi&s;aries a neighbouring monarch, came with
the &s;ame offers, &s;ent pre&s;ents and promi&s;ed fidelity; there was &s;till
a third mo|narch who&s;e name was Porus, from whom Alexander expected &s;imilar
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; he even went to require it of him, but Porus an&s;wered with
great coldne&s;s; that while he could fight, he &s;hould di&s;dain to obey.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this me&s;&s;age Alexander re|&s;olved to enforce
obedience, and giving the &s;uperintendance of his elephants to Omphis, who had
now changed his name to Taxilus; he advanced as far as the borders of the
Hy|da&s;pes. Porus was encamped on the other &s;ide of it in order to di&s;pute
the pa&s;&s;age with him, and had po&s;ted at the head of his army eighty-five
elephants of a prodigious &s;ize, and behind them three hundred chariots
guarded by <PB N="259" REF="261"> thirty thou&s;and foot; not having at mo&s;t
above &s;even thou&s;and hor&s;e. This prince was mounted upon an elephant of a
much larger &s;ize than any of the re&s;t; and he him&s;elf exceeded the
u&s;ual &s;tature of men; &s;o that, clothed in his armour, glittering with
gold and &s;ilver, he appeared at the &s;ame time terrible and maje&s;tic. The
greatne&s;s of his courage equalled that of his &s;tature; and he was as wi&s;e
and prudent as it was po&s;&s;ible for the monarch of &s;o barbarous a people
to be.</P>
<P>The Macedonians dreaded not only the enemy, but the river they were
obliged to pa&s;s. It was four furlongs wide (about four hundred fathoms) and
&s;o deep in every part, that it looked like a &s;ea, and was no where
fordable. It was va&s;tly impetuous, notwith&s;tanding its great breadth; for
it rolled with as much vio|lence as if it had been confined to a narrow
channel; and its raging, foaming waves, which broke in many places,
di&s;covered that it was full of &s;tones and rocks. However, nothing was &s;o
dreadful as the appearance of the &s;hore, which was quite covered with men,
hor&s;es and ele|phants. Tho&s;e hideous animals &s;tood like &s;o many towers;
and the Indians exa&s;perated them, in order that the horrid cry they made
might fill the enemy with great terror. However, <PB N="258" REF="262">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="259" REF="263">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"><PB N="260" REF="264"> this
could not intimidate an army of men who&s;e courage was proof again&s;t all
attacks, and who were animated by an uninterrupted &s;eries of pro&s;perities;
but then they did not think it would be po&s;&s;ible for them, as the banks
were &s;o crazy, to &s;urmount the rapidity of the &s;tream, or land with
&s;afety.</P>
<P>Alexander was in great perplexity with the difficulties that
attended the pa&s;&s;age of this nar|row river; however, he re&s;olved to
attempt it by night, and cho&s;e one who&s;e lightening, thun|der, and
impetuous winds, con&s;pired to drown the noi&s;e of his troops in their
embarkation. Scarce any per&s;on appeared to oppo&s;e their de&s;cent; and the
moment Alexander was landed, he drew up the forces that had pa&s;&s;ed with
him, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix thou&s;and foot, and five thou|&s;and hor&s;e, in
order of battle.</P>
<P>Porus, upon hearing that Alexander had pa&s;&s;ed the river, had
&s;ent again&s;t him a detach|ment, commanded by one of his &s;ons, of two
thou&s;and hor&s;e, and one hundred and twenty chariots. Alexander imagined
them at fir&s;t to be the enemy's van-guard, and that the whole army was behind
them; but being informed it was but a detachment, he charged them with &s;uch
vigour, that Porus's &s;on was killed upon the &s;pot, with four hundred
hor&s;es, and all the chariots were taken.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="265"> Porus, upon receiving advice of the death of
his &s;on, the defeat of the detachment, and of Alexander's approach,
re&s;olved to go and meet Alexander, whom he ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to be at the
head of the choice&s;t troops of his army. Accordingly, leaving only a few
elephants in his camp, to amu&s;e tho&s;e who were po&s;ted on the oppo&s;ite
&s;hore, he &s;et out, with thirty thou|&s;and foot, four thou&s;and hor&s;e,
three thou&s;and chariots, and two hundred elephants. Being come into a firm,
&s;andy &s;oil, in which his hor&s;es and chariots might wheel about with
ea&s;e, he drew up his army in battle-array, with an intent to wait the coming
up of the enemy. He po&s;ted in front, and on the fir&s;t line, all the
elephants, at a hundred feet di&s;tance one from the other; in order that they
might &s;erve as a bulwark to his foot, who were behind. It was his opinion,
that the enemy's cavalry would not dare to en|gage in the&s;e intervals,
becau&s;e of the fear tho&s;e hor&s;es would have of the elephants; and much
le&s;s the infantry, when they &s;hould &s;ee that of the enemy po&s;ted behind
the elephants, and in danger of being trod to pieces. He had po&s;ted &s;ome of
his foot on the &s;ame line with the ele|phants, in order to cover their right
and left; and this infantry was covered by his two wings of hor&s;e; before
which the chariots were po&s;ted. <PB N="262" REF="266"> Such was the order and
di&s;po&s;ition of Porus's army.</P>
<P>Alexander being come in &s;ight of the enemy, waited the coming up
of his foot, which marched with the utmo&s;t diligence, and arrived a little
after; and in order that they might have time to take breath, and not to be
led, as they were very much fatigued, again&s;t the enemy, he cau&s;ed his
hor&s;e to make a great many evo|lutions, in order to gain time. But now every
thing being ready, and the infantry having &s;uf|ficiently recovered their
vigour, Alexander gave the &s;ignal of battle. He did not think proper to begin
by attacking the enemy's main body, where the infantry and the elephants were
po&s;ted, for the very rea&s;on which had made Porus draw them up in that
manner. But his cavalry being &s;tronger, he drew out the greate&s;t part of
them, and marching again&s;t the left wing, &s;ent Coenus, with his own
regiment of hor&s;e, and that of Demetrius, to charge them at the &s;ame time;
ordering him to attack that cavalry on the left behind, during which he
him&s;elf would charge them both in front and flank. Seleucus, Antigonus, and
Tauron, who commanded the foot, were ordered not to &s;tir from their po&s;ts,
till Alexander's cavalry had put that of the enemy, as well as their foot, into
di&s;order.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="267"> Being come within arrow-&s;hot, he detached a
thou&s;and bow-men on hor&s;eback, with orders for them to make their
di&s;charge on the hor&s;e of Porus's left wing, in order to throw it into
di&s;order, whil&s;t he him&s;elf would charge this body in flank, before it
had time to rally. The Indians having joined again their &s;quadrons, and drawn
them up into a narrower compa&s;s, advanced again&s;t Alexander. At that
in&s;tant Coenus charged them in the rear, according to the orders given him;
in&s;omuch, that the In|dians were obliged to face about on all &s;ides, to
defend them&s;elves from the thou&s;and bow-men, and again&s;t Alexander and
Coenus. Alexander, to make the be&s;t advantage of the confu&s;ion into which
this &s;udden attack had thrown them, charged with great vigour tho&s;e that
had made head again&s;t him; who being no longer able to &s;tand &s;o violent
an attack, were &s;oon broke, and retired behind the elephants, as to an
impreg|nable rampart. The leaders of the elephants made them advance again&s;t
the enemy's hor&s;e; but, that very in&s;tant, the Macedonian phalanx moving on
a &s;udden, &s;urrounded tho&s;e animals, and charged with their pikes the
elephants them&s;elves, and their leaders. This battle was very different from
all tho&s;e which Alexander had hitherto fought; for the elephants ru&s;hing 
<PB N="264" REF="268"> upon the battalions, broke, with inexpre&s;&s;ible fury,
the thicke&s;t of them; when the Indian hor&s;e, &s;eeing the Macedonian foot
&s;topped by the elephants, returned to the charge: however, that of Alexander
being &s;tronger, and having greater experience in war, broke this body a
&s;econd time, and obliged it to retire towards the elephants; upon which the
Macedonian hor&s;e, being all united in one body, &s;pread terror and
confu&s;ion wherever they attacked. The elephants, being all covered with
wounds, and the greate&s;t part having lo&s;t their leaders, did not ob&s;erve
their u&s;ual order; but, di&s;tracted as it were with pain, no longer
di&s;tingui&s;hed friends from foes; but, running about from place to place,
they overthrew every thing that came in their way. The Macedonians, who had
pur|po&s;ely left a greater interval between their bat|talions, either made way
for them whenever they came forward, or charged with darts, tho&s;e that fear
and the tumult obliged to retire. Alexander, after having &s;urrounded the
enemy with his hor&s;e, made a &s;ignal to his foot to march up with all
imaginable &s;peed, in order to make a la&s;t effort, and to fall upon them
with his whole force; all which they executed very &s;ucce&s;sfully. In this
manner the greate&s;t part of the Indian cavalry were cut to pieces; and a 
<PB N="265" REF="269"> body of their foot, which &s;u&s;tained no
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s lo&s;s, &s;eeing them&s;elves
charged on all &s;ides, at la&s;t fled. Catorus, who had continued in the camp
with the re&s;t of his army, &s;eeing Alexander en|gaged with Porus,
cro&s;&s;ed the river, and charging the routed &s;oldiers with his troops, who
were cool and vigorous, by that means killed as many enemies in the retreat, as
had fallen in the battle.</P>
<P>The Indians lo&s;t, on this occa&s;ion, twenty thou&s;and foot, and
three thou&s;and hor&s;e; not to mention the chariots, which were all broke to
pieces; and the elephants, that were either killed or taken. Porus's two &s;ons
fell in this battle; with Spitacus, governor of the province; all the colonels
of hor&s;e and foot; and tho&s;e who guided the elephants and chariots. As for
Alexander, he lo&s;t but four&s;core of the &s;ix thou&s;and &s;oldiers who
were at the fir&s;t charge; ten bow-men of the hor&s;e, twenty of his
hor&s;e-guards, and two hundred common &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Porus, after having performed all the duty both of a &s;oldier and a
general in the battle, and fought with incredible bravery, &s;eeing all his
hor&s;e defeated, and the greate&s;t part of his foot, did not behave like the
great Darius, who, in a like di&s;a&s;ter, was the fir&s;t that fled: on the
con|trary, he continued in the field as long as one <PB N="266" REF="270">
battalion or &s;quadron &s;tood their ground; but, at la&s;t, having received a
wound in the &s;houlder, he retired upon his elephant; and was ea&s;ily
di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t, by the greatne&s;s of his &s;tature, and his
unparelleled bravery. Alex|ander finding who he was, by tho&s;e glorious marks,
and being de&s;irous of &s;aving this king, &s;ent Taxilus after him, becau&s;e
he was of the &s;ame nation. The latter, advancing as near to him as he might,
without running any danger of being wounded, called out to him to &s;top, in
order to hear the me&s;&s;age he had brought him from Alexander. Porus turning
back, and &s;eeing it was Taxilus, his old enemy, 
<Q REND="inline">"How!" &s;ays he, "is it not Taxilus that calls;
that traitor to his country and kingdom!"</Q> Im|mediately after which, he
would have transfixed him with his dart, had he not in&s;tantly retired.
Notwith&s;tanding this, Alexander was &s;till de|&s;irous to &s;ave &s;o brave
a prince; and thereupon di&s;patched other officers, among whom was Meroe, one
of his intimate friends, who be&s;ought him, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, to
wait upon a con|queror altogether worthy of him: after much entreaty, Porus
con&s;ented, and accordingly &s;et forward. Alexander, who had been told of his
coming, advanced forwards, in order to receive him, with &s;ome of his train.
Being come pretty <PB N="267" REF="271"> near, Alexander &s;topped, purpo&s;ely
to take a view of his &s;tature and noble mien, he being about five cubits in
height. Porus did not &s;eem dejected at his misfortune; but came up with a
re&s;olute countenance, like a valiant warrior, who&s;e courage in defending
his dominions ought to acquire him the e&s;teem of the brave prince who had
taken him pri&s;oner. Alexander &s;poke fir&s;t; and, with an augu&s;t and
gracious air, a&s;ked him how he de&s;ired to be treated? 
<Q REND="inline">"Like a king," replied Porus.</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"But," continued Alexander, "do you a&s;k nothing
more?"</Q> 
<Q REND="inline">"No," replied Porus; "all things are included in
that &s;ingle word."</Q> Alexander, &s;truck with this greatne&s;s of &s;oul,
the magnanimity of which &s;eemed heightened by di&s;tre&s;s, did not only
re&s;tore him his kingdom, but annexed other provinces to it, and treated him
with the highe&s;t te&s;timonies of honour, e&s;teem, and friend&s;hip. Porus
was faithful to him till his death.&mdash;It is hard to &s;ay, whether the
victor or the van|qui&s;hed be&s;t de&s;erved prai&s;e on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Alexander built a city on the &s;pot where the battle had been
fought; and another in that place where he had cro&s;&s;ed the river. He called
the one Nicaea, from his victory; and the other Bucephalus, in honour of his
hor&s;e, who died there, not of his wounds, but of old age. After 
<PB N="268" REF="272"> having paid the la&s;t duties to &s;uch of his
&s;ol|diers as had lo&s;t their lives in battle, he &s;olem|ni&s;ed games and
offered up &s;acrifices of thanks in the place where he had pa&s;&s;ed the
Hyde&s;pes.</P>
<P>Alexander having now conquered Porus, advanced into India, which
having never been a warlike nation, he &s;ubdued with the rapidity rather of a
traveller than a conqueror. Num|berle&s;s petty &s;tates &s;ubmitted to him,
&s;en&s;ible that his &s;tay would be &s;hort, and his conque&s;ts
evane&s;cent.</P>
<P>Alexander, pa&s;&s;ing near a city where &s;everal Brachmans or
Indian prie&s;ts dwelt, was very de&s;irous to conver&s;e with them, and if
po&s;&s;ible to prevail with &s;ome of them to follow him. Being informed that
the&s;e philo&s;ophers never made vi&s;its, but that tho&s;e who had an
inclina|tion to &s;ee them mu&s;t go to their hou&s;es, he concluded, that it
would be beneath his dig|nity to go to them; and not ju&s;t to force the&s;e
&s;ages to any thing contrary to their laws and u&s;ages. One&s;icritus, the
philo&s;opher, who had been a di&s;ciple of Diogenes the Cynick, was de|puted
to them. He met not far from the city fifteen Boxamins, who from morning till
even|ing &s;tood always naked, in the &s;ame po&s;ture in which they at fir&s;t
had placed them&s;elves, and <PB N="269" REF="273"> afterwards returned to the
city at night. He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf fir&s;t to Calanus an Indian,
re|puted the wi&s;e&s;t man of his country, who, though he profe&s;&s;ed the
practice of the mo&s;t &s;evere philo&s;ophy, had however been per&s;uaded in
his extreme old age to attend upon the court; and him he told the occa&s;ion of
his coming. The later gazing upon One&s;icritus's clothes and &s;hoes, could
not forbear laughing; after which he told him, 
<Q REND="inline">"That anciently the earth had been covered with
barley and wheat, as it was at that time with du&s;t, that be&s;ides water, the
rivers u&s;ed to flow with milk, ho|ney, oil and wine."</Q> That man's guilt
had occa&s;ioned a change of this happy condition; and that Jupiter, to
puni&s;h their ingratitude, had &s;entenced them to a long painful labour. That
their repentance afterwards moving him to compa&s;&s;ion, he had re&s;tored
them their for|mer abundance; however, that by the cour&s;e of things, they
&s;eemed to be returning to their ancient confu&s;ion. This relation &s;hews
evi|dently, that the&s;e philo&s;ophers, had &s;ome no|tion of the felicity of
the fir&s;t man and of the evil to which he had been &s;entenced for his
&s;ins.</P>
<P> One&s;icritus was very urgent with both of them to quit their
au&s;tere way of life and fol|low <PB N="270" REF="274"> the fortune of
Alexander, &s;aying, 
<Q REND="inline">"That they would find in him a generous ma&s;ter and
benefactor, who would heap upon them honour and riches of all kinds."</Q> Then
Mandanis a&s;&s;uming a haughty philo&s;ophical tone, an&s;wered, 
<Q REND="inline">"That he did not want Alex|ander, and was the &s;on
of Jupiter as well as him&s;elf. That he was exempted from want, de&s;ire or
fear. That &s;o long as he &s;hould live, the earth would furni&s;h him with
all things nece&s;&s;ary for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and that death would rid
him of a trouble&s;ome com|panion (meaning his body) and &s;et him at full
liberty."</Q> Calodanus appeared more tractable, and notwith&s;tanding the
oppo&s;ition, and even the prohibition of his &s;uperior, who reproached him
for his abject &s;pirit in &s;tooping &s;o low as to &s;erve another ma&s;ter
be&s;ides God, he followed One&s;icritus, and went to Alexan|der's court, who
received him with great de|mon&s;trations of joy. As it was Alexander's chief
ambition to imitate Bacchus and Her|cules in their expeditions into the Ea&s;t,
he re|&s;olved like them to penetrate as long as he could meet new nations to
conquer, however his &s;oldiers &s;atiated with &s;poil and fatigued with
repeated encounters, at la&s;t began to open their eyes at the wildne&s;s of
his ambition. <PB N="271" REF="275"> Some bewailed their calamities in &s;uch
terms as rai&s;ed compa&s;&s;ion, others in&s;olently cried out, 
<Q REND="inline">"That they would march no further;"</Q> the chief
object of the King's wi&s;hes, was to invade the territories of Agramenes, a
prince who lived beyond the great river Ganges; and who was able to bring into
the field two hundred thou|&s;and foot, two thou&s;and elephants, twenty
thou|&s;and hor&s;e, and two thou&s;and armed chariots. The &s;oldiers however
refu&s;ed to wander over tho&s;e great de&s;erts that lay beyond the Ganges,
and more terrible to them than the greate&s;t ar|my the Ea&s;t could mu&s;ter;
he addre&s;&s;ed them in the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive terms not to leave their
general behind; he threatened them, that he would take his Scythian and his
Per&s;ian &s;oldiers, and with them alone he would make conque&s;ts worthy of
his name and of his glory; but &s;till the Macedonian &s;oldiers, per&s;i&s;ted
&s;ullen and inflexible, and only at la&s;t complied after many per&s;ua&s;ive
orations to follow him towards the South, to di&s;cover the neare&s;t ocean,
and to take the cour&s;e of the river Indus as their in|fallible guide.</P>
<P>For this expedition he embarked in a fleet con&s;i&s;ting of eight
hundred ve&s;&s;els as well gal|lies as boats, to carry the troops and
provi&s;ions, after five days &s;ailing, the fleet arrived where 
<PB N="272" REF="276"> the Hyde&s;pes and the Ace&s;ines mixed their &s;treams,
there the &s;hips were very much &s;hat|tered, becau&s;e the&s;e rivers unite
with prodigi|ous rapidity. At la&s;t he came to the country of the Oxydrace and
the Mallis, the mo&s;t va|liant people in the Ea&s;t, however Alexander
defeated them in &s;everal engagements, di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed them of their
&s;trong holds, and at la&s;t marched again&s;t their capital city, where the
greate&s;t part of their forces were retired. It was upon this occa&s;ion that
&s;eizing a &s;caling ladder, him&s;elf the fir&s;t, he mounted the wall,
followed only by two of his officers; his at|tendants believing him to be in
danger, mount|ed &s;wiftly to &s;uccour him, but the ladder break|ing, he was
left alone. It was now that his ra&s;hne&s;s became his &s;afety, for leaping
from the wall into the city which was crouded with enemies, &s;word in hand, he
repul&s;ed &s;uch as were neare&s;t, and even killed the general who advanced
in the throng. Thus with his back to a tree that happened to be near, he
received all the darts of the enemy in a &s;hield, and kept even the bolde&s;t
at a di&s;tance at la&s;t an Indian di&s;charging an arrow of three feet long,
it pierced his coat of mail and his right brea&s;t, and &s;o great a quantity
of blood i&s;&s;ued from the wound, that he dropped his <PB N="273" REF="277">
arms and lay as dead. The Indian came to &s;trip him, &s;uppo&s;ing him really
what he ap|peared; but Alexander that in&s;tant recalled his &s;pirits and
plunged the dagger in his &s;ide. By this time a part of the king's attendants
came to his &s;uccour, and forming them&s;elves round his body, till his
&s;oldiers without found means of bur&s;ting the gates, &s;aved him, and put
all the inhabitants without di&s;tinction to the &s;word.</P>
<P>The wound which at fir&s;t &s;eemed dangerous, having in the &s;pace
of &s;ix or &s;even days a mo&s;t favourable appearance, Alexander mounted his
hor&s;e, and &s;hewed him&s;elf to the army, who &s;eem|ed to view him with
in&s;atiable plea&s;ure. Thus continuing his voyage, and &s;ubduing the country
on each &s;ide as he pa&s;&s;ed along, the pilots per|ceived from the
&s;oftne&s;s of the breezes that the ocean was near. Nothing &s;o much
a&s;toni&s;hed the Macedonian &s;oldiers as the ebbing and flowing of the tide.
They were amazed when they &s;aw it ri&s;e to a great height and overflow the
country, which they con&s;idered as a mark of divine re&s;entment; they were no
le&s;s terrified &s;ome hours after, when they &s;aw the river for|&s;ake its
banks, and leave tho&s;e lands uncovered it had &s;o lately overflowed. Thus,
after a voy|age of nine months, he at la&s;t &s;tood upon the &s;hore; and
after having offered &s;acrifices to <PB N="274" REF="278"> Neptune, and having
looked wi&s;hfully on the broad expan&s;e of waters before him, he is &s;aid to
have wept for having no more worlds left to conquer. Here he put an end to his
excur|&s;ions; and having appointed Nearchus admiral of his fleet, with orders
to coa&s;t along the In|dian &s;hore as far as the Per&s;ian gulph, he &s;et
out with his army for Babylon.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the hard&s;hips which his army &s;u&s;tained in
their return: pa&s;&s;ing through a country de&s;titute of all &s;orts of
pro|vi&s;ions, they were obliged to fea&s;t on the bea&s;ts of burden, and were
forced to burn tho&s;e rich &s;poils for the &s;ake of which they had
encoun|tered &s;o many dangers; tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es al&s;o, that generally
accompany famine, compleated their calamity, and de&s;troyed them in great
numbers. After a march of three&s;core days, they arrived in the province of
Gedro&s;ia, the fertility of which &s;oon bani&s;hed from the minds of the
&s;oldiery all their former difficulties. Alexander pa&s;&s;ed through the
country, not with the mili|tary pomp of a conqueror, but in the licen|tious
di&s;gui&s;e of an enthu&s;ia&s;t: &s;till willing to imitate Bacchus, he was
drawn by eight hor&s;es, on a &s;caffold in the form of a &s;quare &s;tage,
where he pa&s;&s;ed the days and nights in fea&s;ting. Along the roads where he
pa&s;&s;ed were placed <PB N="275" REF="279"> ca&s;ks of wine in great
abundance, and the&s;e the &s;oldiery drained in honour of his mock deity. The
whole country echoed with the &s;ound of in&s;truments and the howling of
bach|anals, who with their hair di&s;hevelled, with frantic mirth, ran up and
down, abandoning them&s;elves to every kind of lewdne&s;s. This vice produced
one of a much more formidable nature in the king's mind; for it always
en|flamed his pa&s;&s;ions to cruelty, and the execu|tioner generally followed
the fea&s;t.</P>
<P>While he refre&s;hed his army in the&s;e parts, Nearchus was
returned from his expedition along the coa&s;t, and brought him &s;trange
ac|counts of the gold to be found in &s;ome i&s;lands, and of the wonders that
were to be &s;een in others; he was therefore commanded to make &s;ome further
di&s;coveries; and then enter the mouth of the river Euphrates, to meet the
king at Babylon. He here al&s;o executed an act of rigorous ju&s;tice upon
Cleander and others, who had formerly been the mini&s;ters of his ven|geance in
cutting off Parmenio. Again&s;t the&s;e murtherers great complaints had been
made by the deputies of the provinces in which they had commanded; and &s;uch
was the complexion of their crimes, that nothing but the certain expectation of
Alexander's never returning from <PB N="276" REF="280"> India, could encourage
them to commit &s;uch. All men were glad to &s;ee them delivered over to
ju&s;tice. Cleander, with &s;ix hundred &s;oldiers, whom he had employed, were
publickly ex|ecuted; every one rejoicing, that the anger of the king was at
la&s;t turned again&s;t the mini|&s;ters of his vengeance. As Alexander drew
near|er to Babylon, he vi&s;ited the tomb of Cyrus, in the city of Pa&s;argada;
and here he put a Per&s;ian prince, who&s;e name was Or&s;ines, to death, at
the in&s;tigation of Bagoas, an eunuch, who fal&s;ely accu&s;ed Or&s;ines of
robbing the tomb; here al&s;o, Calanus, the Indian, having lived four-&s;core
and three years, without ever having been afflicted with &s;ickne&s;s, now
feeling the approaches of di&s;order, re&s;olved to put him&s;elf to death.
Alexander imagined he might ea&s;ily be di&s;&s;uaded from his de&s;ign; but
finding, in oppo&s;ition to all the arguments he could u&s;e, that Calanus was
inflexible, he gave orders for erecting a funeral pile for him, upon which the
Indian was re&s;olved to die.</P>
<P>Calanus rode on hor&s;eback to the foot of the funeral pile; offered
up his prayers to the gods; cau&s;ed libations to be performed, and the re&s;t
of the ceremonies to be ob&s;erved which are practi&s;ed at funerals; cut off a
tuft of his hair, in imitation of victims; embraced &s;uch 
<PB N="277" REF="281"> of his friends as were pre&s;ent; intreated them to be
merry that day, and to fea&s;t and carou&s;e with Alexander; a&s;&s;uring them,
at the &s;ame time, that he would &s;oon &s;ee that prince in Babylon. After
&s;aying the&s;e words, he a&s;cend|ed, with the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s, the
fu|neeral pile, laid him&s;elf down upon it, and covered his face; and, when
the flame reached him, he did not make the lea&s;t motion; but with a patience
and con&s;tancy that &s;urpri&s;ed the whole army, continued in the &s;ame
po&s;ture in which he at fir&s;t had laid him&s;elf, and com|pleated his
&s;acrifice, by dying agreeably to the &s;trange &s;uper&s;titions of the
enthu&s;ia&s;ts of his country. Alexander punctually obeyed him in his
admonitions to debauchery. A banquet followed the night after, in which
Promacus received a talent as a prize, for having drank the large&s;t quantity
of wine; he &s;urvived his victory, however, but three days, and of the re&s;t
of the gue&s;ts, forty-one died of their intem|perance. From Pa&s;argada,
Alexander proceed|ed to Su&s;a, where he married Statira, the elde&s;t daughter
of Darius, and gave her younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter in marriage to his favourite
Hephe&s;tion. Four&s;core Per&s;ian ladies of rank were given to the principal
favourites among his captains. The nuptials were &s;olemnized after the
Per&s;ian <PB N="278" REF="282"> manner. He likewi&s;e fea&s;ted all the
Mace|donians, who had married before in that country. It is related, that there
were nine thou&s;and gue&s;ts at this fea&s;t, and that he gave each of them a
golden cup for their libations. Upon this occa&s;ion, there appeared at Su&s;a,
three hundred young &s;oldiers, dre&s;&s;ed in the Macedonian manner, whom
Alexander intend|ed particularly to favour, in order to check the
licentiou&s;ne&s;s of his veterans, who had but too ju&s;t rea&s;ons to
murmur.</P>
<P>While Alexander was thus employed in Per&s;ia, a new commotion was
carrying on in Greece. Harpalus, whom Alexander had appointed go|vernor of
Babylon, being di&s;gu&s;ted with his ma&s;|ter's cruelty, and ambitious of
power him&s;elf, went over into Greece, with immen&s;e &s;ums, which he
rai&s;ed from the plundered pri&s;oners of Per&s;ia. He had credit enough to
a&s;&s;emble a body of &s;ix thou&s;and &s;oldiers, and with the&s;e he landed
at Athens: money, at that time, being thought all-powerful in Greece, he
lavi&s;hed immen&s;e &s;ums among the mercenary orators, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s
it was to inflame the minds of the people. Of all the&s;e, Phocion alone, to
whom he offered &s;e|ven hundred talents, pre&s;erved his well-known integrity,
and remained inflexible; his di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s had long been the object
of ad|miration, <PB N="279" REF="283"> even in the time of Philip. Being
offered a great &s;um of money, if not for his own acceptance, at lea&s;t for
the benefit of his children: If my children, cried Phocion, re|&s;emble me, the
little &s;pot of ground, with the produce of which I have hitherto lived, and
which has rai&s;ed me to the glory you mention, will be &s;ufficient to
maintain them; if it will not, I do not intend to leave them wealth, merely to
&s;timulate and heighten their luxury. Alexander having likewi&s;e &s;ent him
an hundred talents, Phocion a&s;ked tho&s;e who brought them, why Alexander
&s;ent him &s;o great a &s;um, and did not remit any to the re&s;t of the
Athenians? It is, replied they, becau&s;e Alexander looks upon you as the only
ju&s;t and virtuous man. Phocion re|joined, let him &s;uffer me &s;till to
enjoy that character, and be really what I am taken for. This, therefore, was
not a character to be corrupted; on the contrary, he u&s;ed all his influence
to prevent the &s;ucce&s;s of Harpalus, who being ordered by the a&s;&s;embly
to depart the city, lo&s;t all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>This commotion was &s;carcely quelled when another en&s;ued, in
con&s;equence of a declaration, by which all the Macedonians, who from their
age or infirmities were unable to bear the fa|tigues <PB N="280" REF="284"> of
war, &s;hould be &s;ent back to Greece. They with &s;editious cries
unanimou&s;ly demanded to be entirely di&s;charged from his &s;ervice,
mur|muring again&s;t him as a de&s;pi&s;er of his brave&s;t troops, and as a
cruel king, who wanted not their ab&s;ence but their de&s;truction. Alexander,
however, acted with that re&s;olution upon this occa&s;ion, which always marked
his character. Being &s;eated on his tribunal of ju&s;tice, he ru&s;hed among
the principal mutineers, &s;eized thirteen, and ordered them to be immediately
puni&s;hed. The &s;oldiers, amazed at his intrepidity, with|held their
complaints, and with down-ca&s;t eyes &s;eemed to beg for mercy. You de&s;ired
a di&s;|charge, cried he: go then, and publi&s;h to the world that you have
left your prince to the mercy of &s;trangers; from henceforth, the Per&s;ians
&s;hall be my guards. This menace &s;erved only to increa&s;e the mi&s;ery and
the con|&s;ternation of his troops; they attended him with tears and
lamentations, till at la&s;t, &s;oftened by their penitence, he once more took
them into favour and affection.</P>
<P>Now &s;ecure from in&s;urrection, he gave him|&s;elf up to mirth and
fea&s;ting; his army was &s;ol|lowed by all the mini&s;ters of plea&s;ure; he
&s;pent whole nights and days in immoderate drinking, and in one of tho&s;e
exce&s;&s;es, Hephe&s;tion lo&s;t <PB N="281" REF="285"> his life. This
courtier was the mo&s;t intimate friend of Alexander. Craterus alone, of all
the Macedonians &s;eemed to di&s;pute this honour with him. Craterus, as the
king u&s;ed to &s;ay, loves the king, but Hephe&s;tion loves Alex|ander. The
death of this favourite threw the monarch into exce&s;&s;ive &s;orrow; he
&s;eemed to receive no con&s;olation; he even put to death the phy&s;ician who
attended him, and the extra|ordinary funeral honours celebrated at his ar|rival
in Babylon, marked the greatne&s;s of his affliction.</P>
<P>After various combats, conque&s;ts, cruelties, follies, and
exce&s;&s;es, Alexander arrived at Ba|bylon; the Chaldeans, who pretended to
fore|&s;ee future events, attempted to per&s;uade him not to enter that city.
The Greek philo&s;ophers on the other hand, di&s;played the futility of their
predictions. Babylon was a theatre for him to di&s;play his glory in; and
amba&s;&s;adors from all the nations he had conquered were there in
rea|dine&s;s to celebrate his triumphs. After mak|ing a mo&s;t magnificent
entry, he gave audience to the amba&s;&s;adors, with a grandeur and dig|nity
&s;uitable to his power, yet with the affabi|lity and politene&s;s of a private
courtier.</P>
<P>At that time he wrote a letter, which was to have been read
publickly in the a&s;&s;embly at <PB N="282" REF="286"> the Olympic-games,
whereby the &s;everal cities of Greece were commanded to permit all ex|iles to
return into their native country, tho&s;e excepted, who had committed
&s;acrilege, or any other crime de&s;erving death; ordering An|tipater to
employ an armed force again&s;t &s;uch cities as &s;hould refu&s;e to obey.
This letter was read in the a&s;&s;embly. But the Athenians and Etolians did
not think them&s;elves obliged to put orders in execution which &s;eemed to
inter|fere with their liberty.</P>
<P>Finding Babylon, in extent and conveniency, &s;uperior to all the
other cities of the Ea&s;t, he re&s;olved to make it the &s;eat of his empire;
and for that purpo&s;e was de&s;irous of adding to it all the ornaments
po&s;&s;ible. But though he was much employed in projects of this kind, and in
&s;chemes even beyond human power to ex|ecute, he &s;pent the greate&s;t part
of his time in &s;uch plea&s;ures as this magnificent city afforded. He was
often pre&s;ent at new banquets, where he drank with his u&s;ual intemperance.
On a particular occa&s;ion, having &s;pent the whole night in a debauch, a
&s;econd was propo&s;ed: he accepted the invitation, and drank to &s;uch
exce&s;s, that, he fell upon the floor, dead to appearance; and in this
lifele&s;s man|ner was carried, a &s;ad &s;pectacle of debauchery, 
<PB N="283" REF="287"> to his palace. The fever continued, with &s;ome
intervals, in which he gave the nece&s;&s;ary orders for the &s;ailing of the
fleet, and the marching of his land forces, being per&s;uaded he &s;hould
&s;oon recover. But at la&s;t finding him&s;elf pa&s;t all hopes, and his voice
beginning to fail, he gave his ring to Perdiccas, with orders to convey his
corp&s;e to the temple of Ammon. He &s;truggled however with death for &s;ome
time, and rai&s;ing him&s;elf upon his elbow, he gave his hand to the
&s;oldiers, who pre&s;&s;ed to ki&s;s it; being then a&s;ked to whom he would
leave his empire, he an&s;wer|ed, To the mo&s;t worthy. Perdiccas enquiring at
what time he &s;hould pay him divine honours, he replied, When you are happy.
With the&s;e words he expired, being thirty-two years and eight months old, of
which he had reigned twelve, with more fortune than virtue.</P>
<P>In whatever light we view this monarch, we &s;hall have little to
admire, and le&s;s to imitate. That courage for which he was celebrated, is but
a &s;ubordinate virtue; that fortune which &s;till attended him, was but an
accidental ad|vantage; that di&s;cipline which prevailed in his army, was
produced and cultivated by his father; but his intemperance, his cruelty, his
vanity, his pa&s;&s;ion for u&s;ele&s;s conque&s;ts, were all his own. His
victories however, &s;erved to <PB N="284" REF="288"> crown the pyramid of
Grecian glory; they &s;erved to &s;hew, to what a degree the arts of peace can
promote tho&s;e of war. In this pic|ture, we view a combination of petty
&s;tates by the arts of refinement, growing more than a match for the re&s;t of
the world united; and leaving mankind an example of &s;uperiority of intellect
over brutal force. After the death of this monarch, Greece was rather
con&s;idered as a &s;eminary for the education and promotion of the laws of
other nations, than a confederacy for enforcing and promulgating her own. The
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alexander &s;eized upon particular parts of his exten&s;ive
empire; and what he gained with much fatigue and danger, became a prey to men
who &s;heltered their ambition under the &s;anction and glory of his name. They
had been taught by him a le&s;&s;on of pride; and as he would never &s;uffer an
equal, his numerous &s;ucce&s;&s;ors could not think of admitting a &s;uperior.
They continued their di&s;putes for dominion until in &s;ome mea&s;ure they
de&s;troyed each other; and as no governments were ever wor&s;e conducted than
their's, &s;o no period of hi&s;tory was ever left in &s;uch darkne&s;s, doubt,
and confu&s;ion.</P>
