</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is plain from this pa&s;&s;age, taken in its connection, that our Saviour never intended to propagate his re|ligion by weapons of offence. Two &s;words were far too few for twelve men; and twelve apo&s;tles were too few to fight again&s;t all the world. This pa&s;&s;age has oftentimes been abu&s;ed by men, who under colour of religion, have intended to a&s;&s;ume power over others, and to gratify their pride or revenge, have made reli|gion, the milde&s;t and mo&s;t merciful in&s;titution, the occa&s;ion of bloody cruelty and &s;laughter.</P>
<P>OUR Saviour did not at this time even intend to defend him&s;elf, or arm his di&s;ciples, to propagate his religion by offen&s;ive arms; for in the following words he &s;hews that he was to &s;uffer, and to propagate reli|gion by his death. But he &s;hews that they had a right to defend them&s;elves again&s;t any unju&s;t a&s;&s;ault, as well as to provide things nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting them|&s;elves
<PB N="6" REF="5">in life. The one he points out to them under the idea of a <HI>pur&s;e,</HI> and the other under the notion of a <HI>&s;word.</HI> When he &s;ent them forth through the cities of Judah, at fir&s;t he forbad them to take either pur&s;e or &s;crip, or change of apparel; but now, they were to go through all the world, he permits them to make nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion for them&s;elves, both with regard to &s;u&s;tenance and defence. They were at the &s;ame time not to go forth as a body of armed men, in com|plete armour, as if they intended to force the go&s;pel upon the world by the point of the &s;word, but only to u&s;e rea&s;onable weapons of defence, like travellers who pa&s;s through a &s;trange country, le&s;t they &s;hould meet with any &s;udden a&s;&s;ault from an unexpected ene|my. That our Saviour means no more than &s;uch a defence as is now mentioned, is manife&s;t from the&s;e words; <HI>And they &s;aid, Lord here are two &s;words; and he &s;aid, it is</HI> ENOUGH.</P>
<P>FROM this pa&s;&s;age, I &s;hall endeavor to demon&s;trate the&s;e two following <HI>propo&s;itions.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT the Chri&s;tian religion is not to be pro|pagated by fighting and violence.</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT it is lawful for Chri&s;tians to defend them&s;elves when unju&s;tly a&s;&s;aulted.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t propo&s;ition is manife&s;t from our Saviour's commandment to his di&s;ciples to love their enemies and pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;ed them, and not &s;o to re&s;i&s;t evil as to do an injury to others, when
<PB N="7" REF="6">it can be avoided. He in&s;tructs his di&s;ciples that they were rather to &s;uffer lo&s;s, than to in&s;i&s;t upon a right which might injure their enemies; that they were ra|ther to part with a coat or a cloak, even things to which they had an undoubted right, than in&s;i&s;t upon a privilege which might be e&s;pecially detrimental to others, who might be &s;o fooli&s;h as engage in an unju&s;t and iniquitous law-&s;uit. It is contrary to the nature of the kingdom of Chri&s;t to make war in &s;upport of it, for he declared in that te&s;timony which he gave be|fore <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> that his kingdom is not of this world, otherwi&s;e his &s;ervants would have fought, that he &s;hould not be delivered to the Jews. The weapons of Chri&s;t's kingdom are not carnal, but &s;piritual, and mighty through God to bring down high thoughts and every imagination, that exalts it&s;elf again&s;t the know|ledge of Chri&s;t. It is owing to men's ignorance of the nature of Chri&s;tianity, that they carry on offen&s;ive wars of any &s;ort; for tho&s;e who know the will of their Lord and Ma&s;ter, will find nothing in all his words and doctrines, that &s;o much as hints the nece&s;&s;ity of war among chri&s;tians. If nations were really chri&s;tian as &s;ome profe&s;s to be, they would not make punctilos of worldly honour and intere&s;t, the rea&s;ons and occa|&s;ions of war. The Apo&s;tle has in a few words given the ju&s;t rea&s;ons and cau&s;es of all wars,&mdash;they proceed from men's lu&s;ts. Religion has no &s;hare in them, it comes from heaven, and is pure and peaceable.</P>
<P N="2">2. The example of Chri&s;t, who in his whole life, conduct, and behaviour, &s;et a pattern to his followers
<PB N="8" REF="7">of love, peace, and benevolence. He could, if he had plea&s;ed, commanded both angels and men to have employed their influence in &s;upport of his kingdom; and yet he u&s;ed no influence but arguments, and the evidence of truth to promote his religion. When <HI>Peter</HI> once made u&s;e of the &s;word, (as he thought) to promote his ma&s;ter's cau&s;e, our Lord commanded him to put it up, with this reproof,&mdash;"All that take the &s;word, &s;hall peri&s;h by the &s;word." It is true, that this pa&s;&s;age does not militate again&s;t lawful &s;elf-defence, but it plainly &s;hews, that Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples are not to be the aggre&s;&s;ors. They mu&s;t not a&s;&s;ault the per&s;ons or properties of others, under a pretence of &s;upporting religion; they mu&s;t not, under an ap|prehen&s;ion that it will promote the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t to do violence to tho&s;e that they may think its enemies, or may really be &s;o. This defence mu&s;t be left to God him&s;elf, who has promi&s;ed to be 'a wall of fire about his church, and the glory in the mid&s;t of her.' Violence of any kind, can never inforce conviction; it may ir|ritate, but can never produce real per&s;ua&s;ion. When men promote religion by force, it argues a real want of conviction of the truth thereof; for the religion that is from above is pure, peaceable, gentle, ea&s;y en|treated, full of good fruits. And the life and exam|ple of Chri&s;t is the mo&s;t perfect pattern of peace and quietne&s;s.</P>
<P>Our Saviour in the whole cour&s;e of his conduct and and behaviour, &s;hewed in what manner his di&s;ciples were to propagate his religion. They were to forgive
<PB N="9" REF="8">their enemies as God forgave them their &s;ins; they were al&s;o to feed them when they were hungry, and give them drink when they were thir&s;ty, and if they were naked they were to clothe them. All this proves that in his kingdom there is no violence nece&s;&s;ary, nor law|ful to propagate religion.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE example of the apo&s;tles and fir&s;t chri&s;tians, who u&s;ed no other methods in propagating the go&s;pel except preaching it, and practi&s;ing its ordinances and duties. They coveted no power, or dominion, nor interfered with what was going on the kingdoms of this world; and in the mid&s;t of much ill u&s;age and oppre&s;&s;ion, they lived &s;oberly and peaceably in the world. When they went preaching the go&s;pel they interfered with no man's bu&s;ine&s;s, nor meddled with the policy of nations; for they were not allowed to have any &s;hare in the management of &s;tates, nor permitted to meddle in temporal affairs; neither did they covet power nor &s;eek after pre-eminence. It was long be|fore chri&s;tians were thought worthy of being members of civil &s;ociety, and when they gained a &s;hare in the direction of temporal governments, they &s;oon began to corrupt religion.</P>
<P N="4">4. FROM the genius of chri&s;tianity, which univer|&s;ally teaches men to promote its principles by its own evidence, and a conver&s;ation becoming the go&s;pel. There would be no need of weapons either offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive, if the doctrines of the go&s;pel were believ|ed and practi&s;ed; for then all men would live peace|ably
<PB N="10" REF="9">and quietly with one another. When the apo&s;tles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the evangeli&s;ts that were &s;ent by them and the churches to preach the go&s;pel, went through the nations, even when they were exceeding|ly ill u&s;ed, we never find that they recommended vio|lence, or de&s;ired the chri&s;tians to take arms to propa|gate the go&s;pel, and the chri&s;tian religion. They pur|&s;ued the allowed means of pre&s;ervation, and exhorted believers to live peaceably with all men; they knew that though the go&s;pel does not inculcate &s;lavery but liberty, yet it is the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made us free, that it commands us to pur&s;ue. To &s;eek to be free from malice, revenge, lu&s;t, covetou&s;ne&s;s, hy|pocri&s;y, and pride; to pur&s;ue liberty from &s;elf-righteou&s;|ne&s;s, religious vanity, and deceit. And if this liberty were pur&s;ued in the manner it is recommended by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, there would be no complaints of op|pre&s;&s;ion, no &s;lavery in nations, no convul&s;ion in &s;tates, no commotions in kingdoms, nor tumults in &s;ociety. The love and power of religion, would promote peace, encrea&s;e love to one another, and &s;ecure public tranquility. But this is not to be expected, when men are lovers of their own &s;elves, covetous, boa&s;ters, heady and high minded.&mdash;When the public teachers of religion are idle, voluptuous, and conform to all times, are more zealous for the fleece than for the happine&s;s of the flock, gratify their appetites, indulge their pa&s;&s;ions, cringe and bow to the great, cea&s;e to reprove them for their vices, and wink at their abomi|nations.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">It is become a very common thing, for public teach|ers to keep company, and be pre&s;ent with their own hearers, of rank and condition, in the mid&s;t of their extravagancies without admini&s;tering tho&s;e reproofs which the go&s;pel commands to be given to all without exception, or giving tho&s;e exhortations, and admoni|tions, that ought to be given daily. Profane &s;wearing, drunkenne&s;s, and un&s;eemly conver&s;ation, meet in the&s;e degenerate times, with no check from the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e who call them&s;elves mini&s;ters of the word of God. They will even &s;ome times throw in their mite to the profane je&s;t, join in the laugh again&s;t religion, and &s;tand &s;teady, till the bottle and the bowl be empty, and then go <HI>tottering home with a good con&s;cience.</HI> In|&s;tead of, being in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on, and out of &s;ea&s;on in preaching, exhorting, admoni&s;hing, and rebuking &s;in|ners, they are in&s;tant at all &s;ea&s;ons, in helping forward the vanity, pride, and indifference of tho&s;e to whom they are pa&s;tors. In their public di&s;cour&s;es their is a barrenne&s;s of religion, which proceeds from the want of that divine &s;alt of the word of God, which only can &s;ea&s;on religion to the &s;ouls of men; and a timidne&s;s of uttering the pure doctrines of the word of God, for fear of offending tho&s;e whom they know have no reli&s;h for truth.</P>
<P>IT is no wonder that the di&s;ciples are like their ma&s;ters when they perceive that <HI>they</HI> wink at &s;in, and do not reprove it, they imagine that there is no cri|minality in it, and pur&s;ue vice without &s;hame or fear. On the fir&s;t day of the week, the day appointed for
<PB N="12" REF="11">the wor&s;hip of God, and religious in&s;truction, the mo&s;t part of modern audiences, in&s;tead of mercy, judge|ment, and faith, righteou&s;ne&s;s, temperance, and judge|ment to come, hear a few &s;mooth turned periods, read over without either the <HI>beauties of holine&s;s,</HI> or the <HI>dangers of &s;in.</HI> If &s;uch a <HI>rara avis,</HI> as the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t happens occa&s;ionally to be delivered in &s;ome congregations, the re&s;t of the brethren mark the preacher for an enthu&s;ia&s;t, a <HI>rude,</HI> and <HI>ungenteel</HI> per|&s;on, di&s;turbing the con&s;ciences of mankind, with the <HI>holine&s;s of God,</HI> and the <HI>ugline&s;s</HI> and <HI>danger of iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Saviour and his apo&s;tles laid the foundation of all true peace and quietne&s;s in righteou&s;ne&s;s, as it was foretold by the prophets in ancient times. <HI>The work of righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be peace, and the effect of righteou&s;ne&s;s, quietne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance for ever. And my people &s;hall dwell in apeaceable habitation, and in &s;ure dwelling place,</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xxxii. 17.</NOTE> Where this righteou&s;ne&s;s is believed, it will meliorate the tempers of men, and make them quiet and peaceable like lambs; under the influence thereof, they will walk humbly with God, and behave peaceably to all men. The doctrine of a divine righteou&s;ne&s;s as the rea&s;on of a &s;inner's accep|tance with God, makes every foul who believes it gentle and ea&s;y entreated, full of love and good fruits. Where this doctrine is con&s;tantly taught and under|&s;tood, the &s;ubjects of all denominations will be holy and peaceable. This is the foundation of all peace with God, and true quiet among men. How can men expect true peace and quiet when they neither hear nor under&s;tand righteou&s;ne&s;s? When they are enter|tained
<PB N="13" REF="12">merely with the enticing words which man's wi&s;dom teacheth, but are not in&s;tructed in the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s which plea&s;eth God? When they hear nothing except the jargon of the &s;choolmen, the cant of ora|tors, or the dry in&s;ipid rea&s;onings of the philo&s;ophers; &s;uch doctrines may teach them to wrangle, and di&s;|pute, and make them hate one another, but cannot form their hearts to love and &s;elf-denial. Diogenes was full as proud as Alexander, although he was poor.&mdash;But he was <HI>only a poor philo&s;opher</HI> and not a believer of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>IT is the knowledge and belief of righteou&s;ne&s;s that forms the difference between a righteous man and a &s;inner, which will always di&s;cover it &s;elf by the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which are peace, and a&s;&s;urance of hope unto the end.</P>
<P>ALL other kinds of tutorage, or tuition, leaves men in a &s;tate of wickedne&s;s, the con&s;equence of which is, <HI>they are like the troubled &s;ea when it cannot re&s;t, who&s;e waters ca&s;t up mire and dirt,</HI> concerning which it is added, <HI>there is no peace &s;aith God to the wicked.</HI> It is no wonder that they are afraid of their hearers turning riotous, who are con&s;cious that they never taught them <HI>that righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> which worketh peace.</P>
<P>Is it wonderful that metropolitans are in&s;ulted when they exerci&s;e &s;o &s;eldom the office of chri&s;tian bi&s;hops? They teach the people by their own exam|ple, that pride, which has been and will be the bane of
<PB N="14" REF="13">peace to the end of the world. In their &s;ermons there is nothing to lead a &s;inner to a true rea&s;on of hope, nor a believer to &s;elf denial and aba&s;ement; and if there were, their own manner of life and behaviour is the &s;tronge&s;t antidote again&s;t their doctrine.&mdash;But where do we &s;ee in the public di&s;cour&s;es of the doctors Til|lot&s;on, Sherlock, Gib&s;on, Secker, and Herring, which are now become the &s;tandard of pulpit eloquence in Great Britain, <HI>the atonement of Chri&s;t,</HI> as the &s;ole re|qui&s;ite of our acceptance with God, the practice of love, obedience, and &s;elf denial &s;et forth in the manner that the apo&s;tles taught them. We may &s;ee the dig|nity of the bi&s;hop, the reverence of the doctor, and the importance of the clergyman, but the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s which is peace, lies buried under that pompous and &s;elf righteous lumber. That this is no calumny thrown upon the&s;e magnificent characters, every one that will read the New Te&s;tament, and their &s;ermons may &s;oon perceive. The images of pride and importance in their method, and manner of teaching mankind, in&s;tead of recommending humility and &s;elf denial, &s;trike the minds and &s;en&s;es of hearers and readers with impre&s;&s;ions of human con&s;equence in their tran&s;actions with God. And in their dignity they are removed at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the ordinary ranks of men, that if death did not prove them to be of the &s;ame &s;pecies and nature, they might be mi&s;taken for another kind of rational creatures. When men are &s;triving for wordly pre-eminence in religious characters; it is im|po&s;&s;ible there can be true peace in the world; for as
<PB N="15" REF="14">&s;ome mu&s;t be preferred to others, it is be yond the power of nature for men to love tho&s;e whom they think have not done them ju&s;tice, or who have &s;up|planted them. That &s;trife which our &s;aviour &s;aw ri&s;ing among his di&s;ciples, <HI>who &s;hould be the greate&s;t?</HI> and which he checked with an early pro|hibition, will never &s;uffer peace to continue where it prevails. But the genius of chri&s;tianity teaches men not to expect any preferment for being religious till Chri&s;t rai&s;es the dead, and for this rea&s;on tho&s;e who be|lieve it re&s;t &s;atisfied in their humble &s;tations knowing that they never can be high in this world provided they live godly and righteou&s;ly. The genius of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t teaches all chri&s;tians to live quietly, and tho&s;e who do not, are only publi&s;hing to the world, that they are not true chri&s;tians, but hypocrites, and unbelievers, who are ignorant of the true nature of chri&s;tianity, and though they profe&s;s Chri&s;t, yet in works they deny him.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE &s;econd propo&s;ition to be demo&s;trated is, that it is lawful for chri&s;tians to defend them&s;elves when unju&s;tly a&s;&s;aulted. This will appear evident.</P>
<P N="1">1. From the example of our &s;aviour, who de&s;ended and pre&s;erved his life till all things, which were writ|ten in the &s;criptures, concerning him were fulfiled, and accompli&s;hed. When he made tho&s;e that came to ap|prehend him fall backwards to the ground, he &s;hewed them what in ju&s;tice he had a right to do, and what they ju&s;tly de&s;erved. He might have re&s;i&s;ted their
<PB N="16" REF="15">violence, and have defended him&s;elf, provided, he had not engaged to yield an obedience unto the death, and to give his life a ran&s;om for &s;inners. To have pre&s;erved his own life by a lawful defence would have been con|&s;i&s;tent both with the law of nature, and with many good and approved examples.&mdash;But he had devoted him&s;elf a &s;acrifice for &s;inners, and could not con&s;i&s;tently with his character of the Me&s;&s;iah, pre&s;erve his own life longer than the &s;cripture was fulfilled concerning him, for he was al&s;o to fulfil it by his death. But till every thing that was written in the law and the prophets was accompli&s;hed in his life, he pre&s;erved it by all law|ful means of defence.</P>
<P>BUT in all ca&s;es of defence, it ought to be particular|ly con&s;idered, never to hurt our enemies provided we can pre&s;erve our&s;elves without doing of it. Religion requires that we only defend our own rights without taking revenge or &s;eeking retaliation; that we pre&s;erve our own lives, without making an attempt upon the lives of tho&s;e who may have a&s;&s;aulted us. Our &s;aviour came not to de&s;troy mens lives but to &s;ave them, and to give his live a ran&s;om for many. It is therefore coun|teracting as far as we can, the end of his coming into the world to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures which tend to endanger other men's lives. That meekne&s;s and mercy which the go&s;pel inculcates, and which it forms in the hearts of all true believers, di&s;po&s;es its followers to &s;hew kindne&s;s to the very wor&s;t of their enemies. It is no principle of the go&s;pel to wi&s;h for revenge and retali|ation;
<PB N="17" REF="16">all its principles are full of clemency, grace and benignity. Good men, and &s;incere followers of Je&s;us, when they defend them&s;elves again&s;t unju&s;t vi$|lence and a&s;&s;ault, will not injure their enemies when they are in their power, nor &s;eek revenge for any for|mer injury which they may have received from them. Tho&s;e that can hurt their enemies de&s;ignedly, and wil|fully, are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;pirit of the Saviour of the world;&mdash;Who prayed for tho&s;e that de&s;pitefully u&s;ed him, and healed the ear of the &s;ervant of the high prie&s;t, who came rudely to a&s;&s;ault him. When men mingle their pa&s;&s;ions with their ideas of right, and religion, they are often ready to do unrighteous, and unju&s;t things; but the go&s;pel teaches all who be|lieve it, to re&s;train their pa&s;&s;ions, and behave &s;oberly. There is a great difference between &s;teadfa&s;tne&s;s and outrage, between defending truth, and committing in|ju&s;tice in &s;upport of it. The go&s;pel allows all men to defend them&s;elves, and their ju&s;t rights, again&s;t vio|lence, and a&s;&s;ault, and to re&s;i&s;t even unto blood, &s;triv|ing again&s;t &s;in, but there is neither precept nor exam|ple in it, that authorizes violence, or permits men to puni&s;h the crimes that are committed again&s;t them with their own hands, when they can pre&s;erve them|&s;elves by mere defence.</P>
<P N="2">2. FROM the example of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> who when the Jews lay in wait for him, and he was afraid of his life, and &s;u&s;picious that their influence with the Roman Governor might prevail again&s;t ju&s;tice, he ap|pealed unto <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> This was claiming the defence
<PB N="18" REF="17">of the civil &s;word, and making u&s;e of the laws, which were originally intended to pre&s;erve the lives of the &s;ubjects. This all Chri&s;tians may do without being charged with either rebellion or infidelity: they may claim the benefit of the laws,&mdash;they may a&s;k the pri|vilege of good &s;ubjects in perfect con&s;i&s;tency with all the doctrines of the Go&s;pel. They may al&s;o remon|&s;trate again&s;t injury and inju&s;tice, and claim the rights of hone&s;t men and good citizens. They may do this with confidence and full a&s;&s;urance, that they are guilty of no crime, nor a&s;k any favour which the Go&s;pel for|bids. If they are citizens they may claim the right of all other good &s;ubjects, and what the laws allow o|thers to claim, cannot be denied them without inju&s;tice. To become pa&s;&s;ive &s;laves, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the cha|racter of rational creatures, and is not required by the Go&s;pel, which is the perfection of rea&s;on. Men who are enemies to all freedom, becau&s;e they them&s;elves are &s;laves to ba&s;e lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, and want to ty|rannize over others, may determine the claims of other men unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t; but let them change &s;ides, and apply their own doctrine to them&s;elves, and they will be obliged to change their opinion, and alter the form of their arguments. The King of I&s;rael could rea&s;on and harangue with great energy again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice of the man who took his neighbour's Ewe-lamb; but when the Prophet told him, <HI>he was the man,</HI> it di&s;arranged his arguments, and confounded all his philo&s;ophy. There is &s;omething exceedingly ab&s;urd in the conduct of tho&s;e who pre|tend
<PB N="19" REF="18">them&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians, and in&s;i&s;t that others bearing the &s;ame character, &s;hould not enjoy the &s;ame privileges which they claim as their right. A Chri&s;|tian mini&s;ter, or Chri&s;tian magi&s;trate, have no claim to privilege or prerogative but what they have from the laws, and the &s;ame laws have &s;ecured the rights of every man who behaves worthily. The ca&s;ui&s;ts of the la&s;t century, who defended the per&s;ecution of the Puritans, in&s;i&s;ted, that <HI>Preces et lachrymae &s;unt arma Eccle&s;iae:</HI> (i. e.) that prayers and tears are the the armour of the Church, profe&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time that they were the true church, and of con&s;equence, that when they per&s;ecuted others, they u&s;ed weapons that did not belong to the church of Chri&s;t. It ap|pears to have a very ill grace, for men profe&s;&s;ing the Chri&s;tian religion to pretend to have a right to im|po&s;e upon others what they plea&s;e, and then to tell them they have no other remedy except prayers and tears. Such language might come con&s;i&s;tently enough from the lips of <HI>Nero, Caligula,</HI> or any heathen per&s;e|cutor, but comes with an ill grace from tho&s;e who profe&s;s to be Chri&s;tians. If Chri&s;tians, when oppre&s;s|ed by Chri&s;tians, have a right to no other remedy ex|cept &s;uffering, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to know from what authority one part of Chri&s;tians derive a right to oppre&s;s the other. If this proceeds from their being in power, and their right is founded upon their domi|nion, it mu&s;t then follow, that <HI>right</HI> and <HI>dominion</HI> are in&s;eparable, and that whoever have the good fortune to be uppermo&s;t can never be in the wrong. It does
<PB N="20" REF="19">not appear that Chri&s;tians, when advanced to power, are exalted above the laws of Chri&s;t, but that a Chri&s;|tian magi&s;trate, is as much obliged to be humble, meek, and merciful, as a Chri&s;tian beggar; bound to deny him&s;elf and to take up his cro&s;s and follow Chri&s;t, as much as the lowe&s;t of the &s;ubjects. A Chri&s;tian ruler, as a church member, is a &s;ubject of the go&s;pel, and bound both by his office and his Chri&s;|tian character, to all the duties of brotherhood, and can never, by any civil office he can bear, be freed from his duty as a Chri&s;tian man. When Chri&s;tians in power claim a right to oppre&s;s their brethren, by vir|tue of their exaltation, they then turn Chri&s;tianity into a &s;y&s;tem of Heatheni&s;m, and renounce the Chri&s;|tian character. The greate&s;t monarch in this world, who profe&s;&s;es the Chri&s;tian religion, and joins in the communion of our Lord's Supper, the moment he for|gets the idea of Chri&s;tian brotherhood, and oppre&s;&s;es his brethren, he gives up the Chri&s;tian character, and and though he may continue to be a king, he can no longer be con&s;idered as a Chri&s;tian. Difference of re|ligion does not make void his authority as a magi|&s;trate, nor free &s;ubjects from their obedience to him in lawful commands, yet &s;uch a practice totally di|ve&s;ts him of that Chri&s;tian character which the New Te&s;tament de&s;cribes. True Chri&s;tians will obey even an unju&s;t ruler, but they will never a&s;cribe to him a Chri&s;tian character. There is &s;omething very ridi|culous in the &s;uppo&s;ition of men claiming the name of Chri&s;tians, when in all the leading parts of their character they are acting incon&s;i&s;tent with the fir&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="20">principles of the go&s;pel. For one part of men profe&s;|&s;ing Chri&s;tianity, to tell another that the go&s;pel obliges them to &s;uffer oppre&s;&s;ion at their hands pa|tiently, is the &s;ame thing as to &s;ay that they them|&s;elves have renounced Chri&s;tianity, and are no longer &s;ubject to the go&s;pel. For what precept or doctrine of the Chri&s;tian religion give any denomina|tion of Chri&s;tians a right to oppre&s;s the others? Tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t the violence of oppre&s;&s;ors, and carry it no farther than re&s;i&s;tance, tran&s;gre&s;s no law of the Chri&s;|tian religion, but tho&s;e who are guilty of oppre&s;&s;ion tran&s;gre&s;s the e&s;&s;ential principles of the go&s;pel, which require us to be merciful, as our Father in heaven is merciful.</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM the example of the Prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> who re&s;i&s;ted the me&s;&s;enger of the King of I&s;rael, who was &s;ent to take off his head. It is a memorable pa&s;&s;age, and we &s;hall read it at large.
<Q>Then he &s;aid, God do &s;o and more al&s;o to me, if the head of <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Shaphat,</HI> &s;hall &s;tand on him this day. And <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> &s;at in his hou&s;e, (and the Elders &s;at with him) and the king &s;ent a man from before him; but ere the me&s;&s;enger came to him, he &s;aid to the Elders, &s;ee how this &s;on of a murderer hath &s;ent to take a|way mine head! Look when the me&s;&s;enger cometh, &s;hut the door, and hold him fa&s;t at the door: is not the &s;ound of his ma&s;ter's feet behind him
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">II Kings, vi. 32.</NOTE>?</Q> Had it been a &s;in to have re&s;i&s;ted royal authority, the &s;anc|tion of a prophet could not have rendered it lawful;
<PB N="22" REF="21">for obedience to the lawful commandments of magi|&s;trates, is the duty of a &s;aint, as well as a &s;inner. Had re&s;i&s;tance of royal violence been &s;inful, the prophet would have been guilty in not patiently delivering up his head. Prophets and Apo&s;tles had no exclu&s;ive pri|vileges with re&s;pect to duty more than others. But it is plain that the prophet re&s;i&s;ted <HI>Jehoram,</HI> and called him the &s;on of a murderer into the bargain. There was here no pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and non-re&s;i&s;tance, but a plain and po&s;itive re&s;i&s;tance of royal authority, at|tended by the king in per&s;on. Whether this is lawful now, and to be imitated under the New Te&s;tament is the que&s;tion? and this que&s;tion our Saviour hath an|&s;wered, when he &s;aid, <HI>that he came not to de&s;troy the law and the prophets, but to fulfil them.</HI> For though he recommended peace, mercy, and good order, he allowed his di&s;ciples to defend their lives again&s;t the attacks of unju&s;t and malevolent men.</P>
<P N="4">4. FROM the authority of the moral law it&s;elf, and the &s;cope of the Go&s;pel, which requires us to pre|&s;erve our own life as well as the lives of others, which could not be done provided we were not allowed to re|&s;i&s;t unju&s;t violence, from whatever &s;ource it may pro|ceed. The &s;ixth commandment of the moral law &s;ays, <HI>thou &s;halt not kill,</HI> which certainly implies that we are to pre&s;erve our own lives, as long as we have not for|feited them by actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of known &s;tatutes. No authority upon earth has a right to take away a man's life while he does nothing but what the law al|lows, and he certainly has a right to defend him&s;elf
<PB N="23" REF="22">again&s;t an Angel, if he &s;hould unju&s;tly a&s;&s;ault him. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Chri&s;t, who came to fufil the law, could ever give commandments and in&s;titutions to make it void, which would be the ca&s;e if the Go&s;|pel obliged us to &s;urrender our lives, and the means of life, at the command of every lawle&s;s tyrant who might require them. We are commanded to honour father and mother, and to obey lawful authority; but if our fathers or mothers, or any other authority, &s;hould find a pretence to rob us of the means of life, or attempt to take away our lives, we are as much bound by the &s;ixth commandment to pre&s;erve them, as by the fifth to &s;hew reverence to authority. And <HI>that</HI> authority can de&s;erve no reverence which requires us to tran&s;gre&s;s the law of God; for it is a fir&s;t princi|ple from which a Chri&s;tian cannot depart, <HI>to obey God rather than man.</HI> If God require us to pre&s;erve our lives by all means lawful, is it not lawful to de|fend our&s;elves when there is no proof of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of any law brought again&s;t us? The arbitrary will of one man, or a thou&s;and, is not law; the laws are known, and <HI>are,</HI> and <HI>ought</HI> to be the objects of every man's judgment: and there are few &s;o unrea&s;onable and wicked, but in the ca&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, will find the evidence of the laws again&s;t them. I have now demon&s;trated the&s;e two propo&s;itions, namely, that re|ligion is not to be propagated by fighting, and wea|pons of offence.&mdash;And that it is lawful for Chri&s;tians to defend them&s;elves again&s;t unju&s;t violence and a&s;|&s;ault. I &s;hall now conclude with giving a few <HI>rules</HI> for ob&s;erving the intention of the Go&s;pel, and pre&s;erv|ing the peace of &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="24" REF="23">1. LET men rule well their own &s;elves and families: let them walk &s;oberly, and &s;hew a good example to their children and dome&s;tics, &s;erving and fearing the Lord. When parents and ma&s;ters of families make free with divine commandments, neglect their duty to God, and al&s;o tran&s;gre&s;s his precepts, they mu&s;t not expect their children and &s;ervants to be faithful. Ex|ample has often more influence than precept, and an evil pattern from a father, or a ma&s;ter, will &s;oon be copied by his children and &s;ervants. Let parents and ma&s;ters, therefore take care that they do not lead tho&s;e under them a&s;tray by their own example. Let ma&s;ters of families wor&s;hip God in their own hou&s;es, in pre&s;ence of, and jointly with tho&s;e that live with them. This will tend to &s;ugge&s;t the pre&s;ence of God twice in the twenty-four hours to all in the family, and nothing has a greater tendency to deter men from iniquity than a &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence. It is a melancholy reflection, that per&s;ons of high life think them&s;elves above wor&s;hiping God in their own fami|lies, and their inferiors take &s;pecial care to follow them; that even beggars are now a&s;hamed of &s;erving God. The world in general, and this nation in particular, are turned &s;o very <HI>polite,</HI> that there are but few hou&s;es where the wor&s;hip of God is ob&s;erved. And I make no doubt but I &s;hall receive &s;ome <HI>genteel</HI> cur&s;es for this reflection; But till this duty is better ob&s;erved, and more punctually performed, there is little hope of the following generation being better than their fathers. Tho&s;e who rob God of his &s;ervice, mu&s;t not expect that the&s;e whom they learn by their example
<PB N="25" REF="24">to proceed in the &s;ame path, will prove hone&s;t to them, any farther than the fear of puni&s;hment may in|fluence them.</P>
<P N="2">2. LET the education of youth be more attended to; let the tender minds o$ children be early &s;ea&s;oned with &s;ound principles and the love of truth. Among other things let them be made to read the &s;criptures, the pure word of God, among their fir&s;t exerci&s;es, af|ter they are taught to read their own language. This is a profitable &s;tudy, for the &s;criptures contain <HI>all things nece&s;&s;ary to make the man of God perfect.</HI> The &s;criptures &s;hould be made a &s;chool book, and u&s;ed in all &s;chools; for it contains a great variety of enter|tainment, and our tran&s;lation of the bible is the be&s;t Engli&s;h author that we have. All our be&s;t au|thors, partake of &s;ublimity in proportion as they imi|tate or borrow from the &s;criptures. And what is more than all, it is in the word of God that we have a rea&s;on of good hope, and the be&s;t rules for keeping a good con&s;cience. The&s;e are things that cannot be too early learned. The be&s;t moral precepts that are contained in other writings though they are valuable and have their u&s;e, are yet dry and in&s;ipid when compared with the doctrines of the &s;acred oracles. The &s;criptures afford us &s;ketches of the mo&s;t ancient hi&s;tory, and in|forms us of what never could have been known with|out them; moreover they warn us how to frame our lives, and &s;hew us that there is a great reward laid up for them that keep the divine commandments. Tho&s;e who know not the &s;criptures, may be &s;aid to know
<PB N="26" REF="25">nothing as they ought to know; and it will &s;eldom or never be found in experience, that tho&s;e that are much given to the reading of the &s;criptures, are wick|ed and unruly. It is a remark exceedingly obvious, that a man makes but a ridiculous figure in the character of an eminent hi&s;torian, who is not well acquainted with the &s;criptures, but in the character of a chri&s;tian he can make no figure at all without that knowledge. Even infidels and dei&s;ts, cannot enliven their own conver&s;ation without &s;ome acquaintance with the &s;acred oracles; for when they intend to &s;ay a <HI>witty</HI> or a <HI>&s;mart</HI> thing, they generally have recour&s;e to the &s;criptures, for &s;ome of their allu&s;ions, &s;imilies, or metaphors, which though they pervert them to their own de&s;truction, yet they plainly &s;hew that they cannot be witty and &s;mart without them. There is not as much u&s;eful knowledge in all the literature in the world as there is in the word of God, it ought therefore to be early &s;tudied.</P>
<P>All the duties which we owe to God and one another are there fully &s;et forth at fir&s;t hand by God him&s;elf. The whole duty of man from the beginning of the world to the end thereof is to be found therein; and and what is more, there is a de&s;cription of the glory that &s;hall be at la&s;t revealed, and a &s;ecurity thereof mo&s;t fully and perfectly delineated.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE mini&s;ters of the word, ought to attend to exhortation, admonition, and rebuke; the pa&s;tors of the churches ought to &s;peak freely to their people, and &s;hew the$ the whole coun&s;el of God. Every pari&s;h
<PB N="27" REF="26">mini&s;ter ought to have no more hearers under his charge, than he can know and do duty to per&s;onally, who&s;e places of abode and manner of life he ought to be acquainted with. As tho&s;e mini&s;ters are &s;aid to have the cure of Soul, they ought to &s;tudy to know in what manner they behave, how they improve in knowledge, encrea&s;e in chri&s;tian practice, and if they attend divine ordinances. They ought particularly to enquire, if parents do their duty, rule well their own hou&s;es, hav|ing their children in &s;ubjection; whether they wor|&s;hip God, read the &s;criptures, and walk humbly. Tho&s;e that are unruly, mu&s;t be admoni&s;hed, and if they are ob&s;tinate rebuked before all, according to the apo&s;tles direction; <HI>Them that &s;in rebuke before all, that others al&s;o may fear.</HI> From the number of loo&s;e, idle and unruly per&s;ons that every where are to be &s;ound committing open wickedne&s;s in the face of the &s;un, it is manife&s;t that the pa&s;tors of the churches do not di&s;|charge their duty. Is it po&s;&s;ible that &s;o many hundred, might &s;ay thou&s;ands of all ranks of men and women, I would &s;o openly profane divine ordinances, &s;pend the &s;abbath day in idlene&s;s wickedne&s;s or plea&s;ure, if they had been early and con&s;tantly in&s;tructed by their teach|ers in the fear and &s;ervice of God? What is the rea|&s;on that we &s;ee &s;o many taking their &s;light on the &s;abbath morning, from the ordinances of the church, but that the church gives them no entertainment, and has no authority over them? Has the church <HI>only</HI> authority over tythes and offerings, and none over the morals and behaviour of her children; Has &s;he no di&s;cipline for profane &s;wearers, &s;abbath breakers, and drunkards;
<PB N="28" REF="27">no cen&s;ures for the di&s;&s;olate, la&s;civious and vile? Or is &s;he rather willing to allow a commutation to conceal the wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e that can &s;pare a little money, and hide their &s;hame under the cloak of forbearance? Can &s;he &s;o far forget her original in&s;titution, as to &s;uf|fer the la&s;civious, the irreligious, the prophaner of the Lord's-day, the coveteous gambler, the &s;wearer and drunkard to eat and drink judgment to them&s;elves, by admitting them promiou&s;ly to the communion of the Lords &s;upper? after &s;eeing of this what may we not expect to follow? What will not men do when they &s;o daringly make free with the ordinances of God, when living in the practice of gro&s;s iniquity?</P>
<P>IT is in the power of the clergy to reform many a|bu&s;es without any other weapons than the word of God. Let them pur&s;ue its doctrines and di&s;cipline con&s;cientiou&s;ly and &s;teadily, and they will &s;oon &s;ee what effect it will produce. Till this is done we mu&s;t not expect good order, peace, and quietne&s;s, in &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P N="4">4. LET magi&s;trates attend &s;trictly to the duty of their office. The magi&s;trate is the mini&s;ter of God for good to dutiful &s;ubjects, and is a terror to evil doers. This is the end of his office. For this end he o$ght to make u&s;e of their authority to &s;ee that the &s;ab|bath day be kept holy; that no unlawful thing be avow|edly done on that holy day: that tho&s;e &s;ports and diver|&s;ions that may be lawful on other days be re&s;trained on the Lord's-day. It has but an ungodly like ap|pearance
<PB N="29" REF="28">to &s;ee the children of many of the lower ranks of the people, come the length of &s;ixteen and eighteen years of age, &s;porting them&s;elves with the ball at the very time that others are going to church, and &s;ome of them by the very walls of the church with|out check or rebuke. Even that ungodly offspring will in&s;ult &s;ober per&s;ons if they but &s;peak to them as they go along. It is owing to &s;uch idle practices on the &s;abbath day, that a number of young per&s;ons, who&s;e parents take no care of them, are gradually initiated in vice and wickedne&s;s. The political parents of the nation &s;hould look after tho&s;e children whom their own parents do not re&s;train. It is true that the church of|ficers give a &s;ide glance to the taverns occa&s;ionally, but they frequently wink with one eye, and are not very &s;trict in their enquiries, on which account many idle and di&s;&s;olute people &s;pend the whole &s;abbath in pub|lic hou&s;es to the ruin of both &s;oul and body.</P>
<P>MAGISTRATES who profe&s;s the chri&s;tian religion ought to &s;hew al&s;o a chri&s;tian example to the &s;ubjects, by living &s;oberly and righteou&s;ly them&s;elves, &s;hewing no partiality in the di&s;charge of their office. They ought to have no re&s;pect of per&s;ons, nor regard the rich more than the poor, but do ju&s;tice to every one. This will create them true e&s;teem, and make them re&s;pected by all ranks of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>LASTLY, Let all who profe&s;s religion obey the laws and lawful authority for con&s;cience &s;ake. Re|member that he is not a good &s;ubject that only re|verences
<PB N="30" REF="29">magi&s;trates through fear of the laws; he mu&s;t do it becau&s;e it is a commandment of God, and an in&s;titution of the go&s;pel: obedience to lawful magi|&s;trates is not merely a political in&s;titution, it is an or|dinance of God and of Chri&s;t, and is binding upon chri&s;tians by the appointment of the Saviour of the world, who both by his example and authority hath laid an obligation upon all his di&s;ciples to obey law|ful magi&s;trates. They are the mini&s;ters of God for good&mdash;A terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to tho&s;e that do well, &s;uch as belong to this congregation know that they cannot tran&s;gre&s;s in this point with|out cea&s;ing to be members of our church, or undergo|ing the &s;eveare&s;t cen&s;ure; but as there are many others here who may think them&s;elves more at liberty, allow me to tell you, that you renounce the chri&s;tian religion when you refu&s;e obedience to magi&s;trates as an ordinance of God. If you choo&s;e to do this, we can only pity your condition and leave you to the mercy of God, but cannot determine you of any other character than unbelievers and enemies to Chri&s;t&mdash; which may God prevent. Amen.</P>
