<P>AN ACCURATE AND DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF THE SEVERAL PAINTINGS IN THE KING OF SPAIN's PALACE AT MADRID; WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE PICTURES IN THE BUEN-RETIRO.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Catalogue was made at my reque&s;t by the Gentleman, who has the &s;uperintendance of the Royal Collection in the Palace at Madrid; and by his favour tran&s;mitted to me after my return out of Spain, but too late to be in&s;erted in my <HI>Anecdotes of Spani&s;h Painters:</HI> There can be no doubt therefore of its being accurate; and I have accordingly &s;o &s;tated it in the title of this publication. If the <HI>de&s;criptive</HI> part had been executed by
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
the &s;ame hand, I might have &s;afely re|commended this performance even to <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors</HI> of the Art; I mu&s;t now ad|dre&s;s it to the <HI>Lovers</HI> only, and &s;ub|mit my weak attempt, with all its errors, to the candour of the Public.</P>

<HEAD>1. Great Stair-Ca&s;e; by D. Cor|rado Giaciunto.</HEAD>
<P>THE compo&s;ition of this bril|liant ceiling repre&s;ents the ri&s;ing of the Sun: Apollo, &s;ur|rounded by various allegorical fi|gures and emblems, gives life and motion to the Elements. Spain, as a matron, habited in an imperial
<PB N="2" REF="5">
mantle, with &s;everal attributes and in&s;ignia proper to her character. The colouring, drawing and de&s;ign very ma&s;terly.</P>
<P>The &s;tair-ca&s;e it&s;elf is a very magnificent work, projected and executed by the celebrated <HI>Sabatini,</HI> a Neapolitan, Architect to His Ca|tholic Maje&s;ty.</P>

<HEAD>2. Great Guard-Chamber; by D. Juan Bauti&s;ta Tiepolo.</HEAD>
<P>Vulcan forging the armour of Aeneas at the reque&s;t of Venus: Mars, in a triumphal character, &s;u|perintending and protecting the work. Various figures, emblema|tic of the Provinces, Religion, Va|lour, Victories and Productions of Spain.</P>

<HEAD>3. Ball-Room; by Corrado.</HEAD>
<P>In the center of this ceiling Re|ligion is &s;eated, and the Church triumphant, enthroned amid&s;t the clouds; to which Spain is offering gifts and incen&s;e in an attitude of adoration: The nations, &s;ubject to her empire, are introduced with their re&s;pective emblems: In the four corners are the Elements, in medallic compartments: Over one of the entrances there is a group of various figures, with Boys em|ployed in placing crowns of palm upon the principal characters: Over another entrance, Hercules is de|&s;cribed in the act of pulling down his pillars at the command of Nep|tune, who in his chariot pa&s;&s;es the
<PB N="4" REF="7">
Streights, making his way through the barrier of antient navigation. This is a very brilliant de&s;ign, rich and glowing in colour and execu|tion, and producing a very &s;uperb and &s;triking effect.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="room">
<HEAD>4. King's Anti-Chamber; by Tie|polo.</HEAD>
<P>The Monarchy of Spain, as a maje&s;tic Matron in an imperial mantle, with a Lion at her &s;ide: An attendant figure in the act of placing a crown on her head: Apollo with his lyre and the Mu&s;es form a &s;eparate group: Ca&s;tile in the character of a female, with her proper attributes: Hercules break|ing down his pillars for the purpo&s;e of laying open the barrier of Africa:
<PB N="5" REF="8">
Sacrifices and Oblations repre|&s;ented in four medallic compart|ments, and addre&s;&s;ed to the Deities, who appear in the principal com|po&s;ition.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="room">
<HEAD>5. Grand Saloon; by the &s;ame Ma&s;ter.</HEAD>
<P>The painter has here per&s;onified the various characters of the Spa|ni&s;h monarchy: The figures are emblematic of Power, Religion, Wealth, Plenty, Victory, &amp;c. &amp;c. The provinces of Spain are di&s;po&s;ed over the cornice with their proper attributes: The medals in the an|gles are by the &s;ame ma&s;ter; but the Boys that &s;upport them, and the naked River-Gods, as likewi&s;e the gilt compartments, where the Ele|ments
<PB N="6" REF="9">
are repre&s;ented, are by the hand of <HI>Robert Mitchell.</HI> This ceil|ing and all the embelli&s;hments are profu&s;ely rich and &s;plendid.</P>
<P><HI>Tiepolo</HI> was a &s;tudent of the Ve|netian &s;chool, and died at Madrid, in the king's &s;ervice, on the 27th of March 1770.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="room">
<HEAD>6. King's Dining-Room; by A. R. Mengs.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Apotheo&s;is of Trajan.</HI> The deified Hero is &s;eated on a throne of re&s;plendent glory: The virtues and attributes of a perfect monarch &s;urround his throne: A chaplet of laurel is &s;upported in the air by five imaginary beings, under which the arti&s;t has contrived to deli|neate the victories of this imperial
<PB N="7" REF="10">
Spaniard: The temple of Immor|tality appears in view, and the choir of Mu&s;es are &s;een in the act of ce|lebrating his glories. Other alle|gorical figures are inter&s;per&s;ed in the compo&s;ition with extraordinary judgment and contrivance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="room">
<HEAD>7. King's Supper-Room; by the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Apotheo&s;is of Hercules.</HI> He is conducted by Mercury to Jupi|ter, who inve&s;ts him with the crown of immortality, as a reward for his labours and conque&s;ts: A group of Deities a&s;&s;i&s;t in the ceremony; the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tics of the &s;everal Deities, male and fe|male, are marked with great ta&s;te and much cla&s;&s;ical preci&s;ion: The
<PB N="8" REF="11">
arti&s;t has given proof of his pro|found &s;tudy and experience in the antique: The colouring, per&s;pec|tive, and general di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e two ceilings are inimitable: There is no crowd, flutter, or deficiency in the whole or part; the &s;everal groups con&s;pire and harmonize in the mo&s;t perfect and beautiful man|ner; the eye is not di&s;tracted by any predominance of detached parts, but receives the whole magnificent compo&s;ition, as one compleat pic|ture, at a glance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="note">
<P>The&s;e Fre&s;cos (e&s;pecially the Apotheo&s;is of Trajan) are, as I conceive, far &s;uperior to his Paint|ings in oil; and in this province of his art, Mengs appears a very ca|pital ma&s;ter: I have never &s;een any

thing equal to them; and &s;o admi|rable they appeared to me upon re|peated vi&s;its, that I mu&s;t believe there are few productions in art, which can better gratify the curio|&s;ity of a traveller.

<P><HI>Titian.</HI> Two large pictures of Si&s;yphus and Prometheus in their torments: the figures above hu|man &s;ize: They were painted by this ma&s;ter in Spain, and are fi|gures of great force, colouring and expre&s;&s;ion. The manner of treat|ing the Prometheus much re&s;embles that of a celebrated picture on the &s;ame &s;ubject at Kimbolton Ca&s;tle: As the noble owner has no deter|mined tradition of its author, I &s;hall hazard a conjecture, that it

Mirror, which Cupid holds up to her face. With one of her hands &s;he pre&s;&s;es her bo&s;om, which is un|covered, and the action is delicately expre&s;&s;ed. The&s;e pictures hang level with the eye on each &s;ide of a door fronting the great entrance; the effect is remarkably &s;triking, the relief bold, and the colouring nature it&s;elf; but perhaps the exe|cution has not that fini&s;hed delica|cy, which many of his earlier com|po&s;itions have: The characters, both of one and the other, are cer|tainly of a wanton ca&s;t; the per|&s;on half-uncovered, half-concealed, with &s;uch a &s;tudied negligence of dre&s;s, and &s;o much playfulne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion and attitude, that the draperies &s;eem introduced &s;or no
<PB N="19" REF="22">
other purpo&s;e but to attract the at|tention more &s;trongly to the charms they do not &s;erve to hide.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Titian.</HI> Venus pre&s;ents a cup to a Nymph: Two Satyrs in the back ground with ba&s;kets of fruit: This, like the former, is the <HI>Venus la&s;civa.</HI> The contra&s;t of hues between the prominent figure and the Satyrs in &s;hades is managed with ma&s;terly addre&s;s.</P>
<P>All who are conver&s;ant in the works of this ma&s;ter will better conceive the &s;triking effect of the&s;e three compo&s;itions, than any de|&s;cription of mine can convey: In whatever collection they hung, they would certainly be very dangerous neighbours to mo&s;t other colouri&s;ts who came in contact with them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<PB N="20" REF="23">
<P><HI>Titian.</HI> Adam and Eve in Pa|radi&s;e; the &s;ize of life; a very ca|pital picture, upon a large canva&s;s; both figures of con&s;ummate beauty, and of a &s;ublime and cha&s;te charac|ter; their attitudes &s;imple, natural, without any trace of the Academy in their di&s;po&s;ition: The carna|tions are not florid, and the whole hue of the piece rather du&s;kier than is u&s;ual with this ma&s;ter: The back-ground pre&s;ents a noble land|&s;cape; the &s;cenery finely character|ed, and in beautiful harmony.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="artist">
<P><HI>Rubens.</HI> A copy of the above on a cloth of the &s;ame &s;ize; this copy hangs between the windows in an unfavourable light, and op|po&s;ite to the original. It is a ma&s;|terpiece of colouring, and though
<PB N="21" REF="24">
it has mi&s;&s;ed the delicacy of the model, I am inclined to think it has &s;urpa&s;&s;ed it in force and effect. It is evident that Rubens has put his whole &s;trength to the work, and as his efforts have been decidedly ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the colouring, his figures have a broader nakedne&s;s (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it), than they have in the original; whereas there is a purity in Titian's nakedne&s;s, which is in character with the &s;ubject, and fully corre&s;ponds with the mo&s;t refined conceptions of human nature in it's primitive &s;tate of innocence and beauty: When we contemplate Titian's Adam and Eve, we are convinced they never wore cloaths; turn to the copy, and the &s;ame per|&s;ons appear to have laid theirs
<PB N="22" REF="25">
a&s;ide, and expo&s;ed them&s;elves to &s;hame for the credit of the painter.</P>

<P><HI>Tintoret.</HI> Two noble compo&s;i|tions from &s;acred hi&s;tory, compa|nions.

A copy of this famous picture, upon a &s;mall &s;cale, was taken for the late Lord Grantham, when he was amba&s;&s;ador in Spain, and brought over by his Lord&s;hip to England.

<P><HI>Titian.</HI> Charles V. in complete armour; his lance in his hand, his vizor up, and him&s;elf mounted on a beautiful hor&s;e; he is preparing to pa&s;s his troops over a river, which is de&s;cribed in the &s;cenery of the back-ground, of the &s;ize of life, upon a very large canva&s;s: This picture &s;ets all de&s;cription at de|fiance,

<P>In the countenance of the mo|narch we read his hi&s;tory, or (which perhaps is nearer to truth) recol|lecting his hi&s;tory, we acknowlege the agreement of character in every line, and in the reflection of his features we find the painter has re|corded the annals of his life: Ne|ver was more expre&s;&s;ion of a mind committed to canva&s;s. A pen&s;ive dignity prevails, traced with marks of pain and bodily decay: He is
<PB N="32" REF="35">
deep in thought; his eyes gloomy and &s;evere, the lids heavy, inflated and remarkably low over the eye|balls; the under-lip projecting, and the mouth characteri&s;tic of revenge and re&s;olution: He is advancing to give battle to the unfortunate Elec|tor of Saxony and the Landgrave, tho&s;e oppo&s;ers of his power and of his faith; external objects have no &s;hare in his attention; the whole man is engro&s;&s;ed by the deepe&s;t meditation: His lance is poi&s;ed pa|rallel with the ground, and ranges along the &s;ide of his hor&s;e, with the point advanced beyond its brea&s;t; the action of the animal harmonizes with the character of his rider, &s;lowly and compo&s;edly &s;tepping forward, the head low

<DIV1 TYPE="conclusion">
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>I have now gone through the Ca|talogue of this noble collection; and, as I have rea&s;on to think it is the only correct and entire account yet
<PB N="106" REF="109">
publi&s;hed, I hope it will be accept|able to the curious reader. Mengs's remarks only go to a few pictures, and the account of them in the <HI>Viage de E&s;pan~a,</HI> by <HI>Don Antonio Ponz,</HI> is very far from perfect, though it is a work otherwi&s;e replete with in|tere&s;ting information; and, as a ge|neral directory to travellers in Spain, no book can be better contrived.</P>
<P>If the lovers of the art are curi|ous to analyze this account, and &s;e|parate the re&s;pective works of the &s;everal great ma&s;ters, they will find it to be a va&s;t collection, which the Spani&s;h monarchs Charles V. Phi|lip II. III. and IV. ama&s;&s;ed within the periods of their reigns: And if we add to this the great collection in the E&s;corial, that of the Buen-Retiro,
<PB N="107" REF="110">
the many fine pictures which were burnt in the Pardo, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t capital which have been di&s;carded in the pre&s;ent reign, the amount will appear prodigious, and, I apprehend, is not to be equalled by any other &s;ingle collection in Europe.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Titian, Vela&s;quez, Rubens, Mu|rillo</HI> and <HI>Spagnolet,</HI> I find above one hundred and forty pictures in this &s;in|gle Catalogue; forty-three of which are by the hand of <HI>Titian:</HI> I mu&s;t take the liberty notwith&s;tanding to &s;ugge&s;t that this collection would &s;till allow of many draughts to be made; and if the&s;e vacancies were filled up from the Buen-Retiro only (not to mention the E&s;corial) it would be much more perfect.
<PB N="108" REF="111">
Some of <HI>Luca Jordano</HI>'s pictures might well be &s;pared; <HI>Corrado</HI>'s &s;ketches, the pourtraits of <HI>Vanlo</HI> and <HI>Ynza,</HI> and &s;ome of <HI>Mengs</HI>'s inferior performances, would be well ex|changed for a &s;elect number of <HI>Ba&s;|&s;an</HI>'s from the old Palace, for a ca|pital <HI>Lucretia</HI> by <HI>Guido,</HI> which hangs there in ob&s;curity, and many others that might be named.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be regretted, that <HI>Ve|la&s;quez</HI>'s famous picture of Jacob re|ceiving the bloody Coat of his Son Jo&s;eph, and a very fine <HI>Guercino</HI> on the &s;ubject of Su&s;anna and the El|ders, both which now hang in a wretched hole in the E&s;corial, not appropriated to any &s;acred u&s;es, &s;hould not be removed from thence, and added to the royal collection.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="112">
Advantageous changes might al&s;o be made in the arrangement of the pictures; for in the quarter belong|ing to the Prince and Prince&s;s many capital pictures of <HI>Raphael, Corregio, Leonardo de Vinci, Julio Romano, An|drea Sacchi, Andrea del Sarto,</HI> and others, are very unfavourably hung; the chamber in which the principal pieces are, being a mean ob&s;cure room, filled with lumber, and not in the &s;uite of great apartments: The ma&s;ters are cla&s;&s;ed, in general, with|out much &s;cientific attention to their &s;tiles of colouring; &s;o that the florid pictures oftentimes brow-beat the more tender; and the cold, laboured regularity of Mengs ill contra&s;ts the warm and glowing canva&s;&s;es of <HI>Ti|tian, Rubens,</HI> and <HI>Vela&s;quez.</HI> But if
<PB N="110" REF="113">
this remark holds good again&s;t the &s;orting of the pictures in this palace, how much more to be lamented is the condition of the capital pictures in the E&s;corial, where the inimitable <HI>Perla</HI> of <HI>Raphael,</HI> the Holy Family of <HI>Andrea del Sarto,</HI> and the famous <HI>Tintorett</HI> of Chri&s;t wa&s;hing his Di&s;ciples' Feet, hang aloft in du&s;t and darkne&s;s over the pre&s;&s;es that contain the Reliques in the Sacri&s;ty, and are almo&s;t totally out of &s;ight. This mu&s;t be painful to every lover of the art, but to the Engli&s;h tra|veller more than any, who will na|turally ca&s;t a look of pity and af|fection towards the&s;e intere&s;ting ob|jects, once in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an elegant and unhappy monarch, who left them as monuments of his
<PB N="111" REF="114">
ta&s;te, to be alienated from his crown and nation by an unfeeling crew of fanatics, as barbarous as they were bloody.</P>
<P>It is to be regretted, that &s;o few engravings have been taken from the capital pictures in Spain; I procured all that were to be had, and the col|lection is very &s;mall: Two more may be &s;oon expected by the hand of <HI>Zelma,</HI> an eminent arti&s;t; viz. of the <HI>Pa&s;mo de Sicilia</HI> and the <HI>Perla:</HI> The <HI><ABBR>Nra</ABBR> Sen~ora del pez</HI> has been en|graved by Bartolozzi. It were greatly to be wi&s;hed that proper encourage|ment &s;hould be given to our young arti&s;ts of talents to take drawings of &s;ome of the&s;e pictures above de|&s;cribed; in which I am confident they would meet every po&s;&s;ible fa|vour
<PB N="112" REF="115">
and protection from the royal owner of the collection. Several pictures might be pointed out in this Catalogue, and el&s;ewhere, which would be admirable &s;ubjects, and rai&s;e the credit of our arti&s;ts, already &s;o high in e&s;timation: At the &s;ame time that I venture to recommend this undertaking, I am not without &s;ome grounds to hope that it is in contemplation.</P>
<P>I &s;hould here take notice, that in the above Catalogue no account is taken of the pictures in the apart|ments of the Infants Don Gabriel; Don Antonio and Don Luis: In the former there are &s;ix Sacred Hi&s;tories by <HI>Luca Jordano,</HI> from pa&s;&s;ages in the Life of the Virgin Mary; al&s;o an Ab&s;alom, and a &s;mall &s;ketch by

Among&s;t the works of <HI>Rubens</HI> there is an Ar|chimedes, a Mercury, Hercules kil|ling the Hydra, Apollo and Pan, and two pourtraits of Ladies of the Hou&s;e of Medici, with &s;ome &s;ketches; two pourtraits by <HI>Vandyke,</HI> one very capital of the Infant Don Ferdinand.
