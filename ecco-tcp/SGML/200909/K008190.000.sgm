<P>_THE Author of the &s;ub&s;equent &s;heets remem|bering &s;omewhere to have met with an anecdote greatly parallel with his own ca&s;e, humbly begs leave to recite it. And this he is the more de&s;irous of, as he thinks it will &s;ufficiently <HI>&s;hew cau&s;e</HI> why he has mi&s;|employed &s;o much of his Time, on &s;ubjects wholly un|worthy his, and the publick's attention. An a&s;&s;ertion &s;trongly confirmed by a <HI>quaere</HI> the author had put to him the other day by a Gentleman conver&s;ing with him upon the intended plan of his Retort. Who immediately (and <HI>with great ju&s;tice it mu&s;t be admitted) interrogated</HI> him in the following words from <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q><L>Ten' moveat cimex PANTILIUS? (1) aut cruciet, q&ugrave;od</L>
<L>Vellicet ab&s;entem DEMETRIUS? (2) aut quod ineptus</L>
<L>FANNIUS (3) Hermogenis laedat conviva Tigelli?</L>
<BIBL>SAT. X. Lib. 1.</BIBL></Q> 3nhich at fir&s;t almo&s;t bia&s;&s;ed the author into a re&s;olution to &s;uppre&s;s his intended publication. But at length, like <HI>Chal|cas</HI> in the &s;econd Aeneid of <HI>Virgil, Magnis Clamoribus actus,</HI> of <HI>the Reverend cimex Pantilius</HI> and Co. <HI>compo&s;ito rumpit vocem.</HI> And now mo&s;t humbly &s;ubmits him&s;elf and piece to the candor of the <HI>ingenuous</HI> public; avoiding <HI>their</HI> cen&s;ure, being the height of his ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="5">THE anecdote intended to be recited, is as follows&mdash;<Q>When Demetrius was arraigned at Athens for tyranny, Menander was upon the verge of &s;uffering death, on no other account whatever, than from a &s;uppo&s;ition and report prevailing of his being a friend and intimate of the traitor's.</Q> Like him has the pre&s;ent author been mo&s;t illiberally brought under the &s;ame la&s;h with a Gen|tleman, whom the NOBLE TRIUMVIRATE have thought proper to cen&s;ure, vilify, and defame. And like Me|nander too, has he &s;uffered this, on no other <HI>apparent</HI> ac|count, than from a &s;eeming intimacy and friend&s;hip &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between him and this Gentleman.
<Q><L>Hinc <HI>&s;ibi</HI> prima Mali Labes, hinc &s;pargere Voces</L>
<L>In vulgum ambiguas.</L>
<BIBL>VIRG.</BIBL></Q>
But the Author would recommend it to this <HI>literary Po|lyphemus</HI> and his two <HI>nefandi Cyclopes</HI> for the future, to be &s;ure they &s;trike a foe, and to act upon more liberal prin|ciples, remembering,
<Q><L>If Maevius &s;cribble in Apollo's &s;pight,</L>
