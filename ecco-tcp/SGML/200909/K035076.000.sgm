<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Pre&s;ent Importance of the Subject.</HEAD>
<P>THE difference of the effects of war and peace on the prices of bread-corn, is, from the &s;ingular rates of the market at this time, a &s;ubject of di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t importance. An opinion is entertained by &s;ome, and encouraged by others of better information, that the natural tendency of the &s;tate of war has been at all periods, to rai&s;e the rates of the market: this is propagated, not in ob&s;cure meetings, but legal a&s;&s;emblies: and the committee appointed by the corporation of London, to inquire into the rife of the price of provi&s;ion, has been openly cen&s;ured in court, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing in their report all mention of the war, which was a&s;&s;erted to be the leading cau&s;e of it, and the &s;ame per&s;ons have returned to the repetition of this erro|neous and inflammatory po&s;ition, on occa&s;ion of a plan now under the con&s;ideration of the cor|poration.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">The circum&s;tances of the&s;e times, in which we are attacked by foreign was and by &s;edition at home, render this an error pregnant with the wor&s;t of dangers: the populace will yield a ready ear to the demagogue or agitator who is able to per&s;uade them, that he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a cure for any &s;uffer|ings they may labour under: and this kingdom never contained in it, &s;uch an army of enemies of this de&s;cription. The calamities of adver&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, they per&s;uade the uninformed cla&s;s to be the guilt of their governors; and that they them&s;elves are their only true protectors; the only per&s;ons attentive to their intere&s;ts, which can be &s;ecured &s;olely by em|bracing their mea&s;ures. The ruin the diffu&s;ion of &s;uch a belief may bring upon us needs not to be enlarged on: in this &s;tate of &s;uffering of the poor, the &s;eeds of commotion are widely &s;own; and the eruption of a &s;ingle riot may be the commencement of a formidable in&s;urrection; and that the &s;ignal of more.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> The Que&s;tion, whether war increa&s;es the price of Corn? treated on general principles.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two ways which may be employed to inve&s;tigate the difference of the effects of war and peace on the prices of wheat in pa&s;t periods,
<PB N="3" REF="6">in order to determine how far its pre&s;ent rate is to be a&s;cribed to the former. The fir&s;t by general principles, as they are called; the &s;econd from yearly regi&s;ters of prices for periods of &s;ufficient duration. In the fir&s;t mode, the cau&s;es tending to advance or depre&s;s the rates of the market both in war and peace, may be enumerated: but when we have done this, no preci&s;e re&s;ult can be de|duced from them; we being unable to a&s;&s;ign, <HI>numerically,</HI> the effects of any one of either kind; and con&s;equently to &s;trike a balance between the re&s;pective &s;ums of both. An advantage may indeed probably appear on the one &s;ide or the other: &s;till the conclu&s;ion from the nature of &s;uch arguments, the re&s;ults of which are probabilities of an indefinite magnitude only, will not be &s;o cogent as to &s;ilence a determined opponent.</P>
<P>The general allegations, on which I conceive it will be attempted to &s;how, that war rai&s;es the price of provi&s;ions, and principally corn, are the following. <Q>It always is attended with a train of new taxes, which although they be not primarily laid upon corn, yet circuitou&s;ly rai&s;e the market; for if the tax be laid on leather, tea, &s;ugar, or any other article of his con&s;umption, the farmer mu&s;t &s;ell his corn for &s;o much more to the &s;hoe|maker, the grocer, or other vender of the newly taxed article. War be&s;ide, by dimini&s;hing the number of the cultivators of the land, mu&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="7">dimini&s;h the quantity of its product and enhance its prices: whereas in peace, the capital of the farmer annually increa&s;ing, new lands are yearly cultivated, old ones improved, and the quantity of corn rai&s;ed greatly augmented. And la&s;tly, the demand for the army and navy is great, and mu&s;t produce an effect on the rate of the market proportionally great.</Q></P>
<P>On the contrary, it is to be urged, that this circuitous effect of taxes, if not ab&s;olutely an ideal allegation, can be in amount very little. If the con&s;umption of the newly taxed commodities be not dimini&s;hed, an effect which very &s;eldom takes place, in proportion to the augmentation of their prices, and frequently not at all, the whole body of the con&s;umers will have &s;o much the le&s;s to expend for all other articles jointly; the prices of which mu&s;t be reduced, or part of them remain un&s;old: a point fully confirmed by the experience of the fir&s;t (A) 56 years following the revolution. A part of our &s;oldiers and land-men for the navy are taken from the cultivation of the land, but a greater number is taken from cities and great towns, in proportion to their population. As the former are the producers, &s;o the latter are the con&s;umers of corn: the inhabitants of the villages are e&s;timated to be in number double to tho&s;e in the cities and great towns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Price, Rev. Payments, v. ii, p. 178.</NOTE> Now if all &s;o taken had
<PB N="5" REF="8">been employed in foreign countries and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on their products, and if it &s;hould be gratuitou&s;ly allowed, that the product of corn would be dimini&s;hed in the proportion of the hands em|ployed in cultivation; yet the demand of the people remaining in their dwellings, will decrea&s;e with the number of non-productive con&s;umers, that is, in a greater proportion. Therefore, if all our &s;oldiers and &s;ailors had been employed on foreign &s;ervices, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on foreign product, there would be a great fall of the price of bread-corn. But a great part of them have actually been during the war &s;o employed in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, our garri&s;ons, on the continent, and in Ireland. To the&s;e are to be added the ordinary and able &s;eamen of the navy on many foreign &s;tations; who having been &s;ea-faring men before, were chiefly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by the corn of this i&s;land, and are now chiefly &s;upported by that of other countries: and there remains another con&s;iderable article to be brought to account, the &s;upply of that part of the whole body of officers, which may be taken as permanently ab&s;ent; and who were before con|&s;umers not producers of corn. Thus on the aggregate it appears, if the quantity of corn rai&s;ed be taken to be a little dimini&s;hed, the demand for it is reduced in a much greater ratio.</P>
<P>And in what is already &s;aid, the an&s;wer to the la&s;t rea&s;on alledged to &s;hew that war mu&s;t rai&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="9">the price of corn, is in a great mea&s;ure antici|pated. Our land and &s;ea forces are greatly in|crea&s;ed in war; and the augmentation, it is certain, is partly &s;upplied by corn purcha&s;ed by public contract; but in peace tho&s;e men had intirely been fed by corn purcha&s;ed by them&s;elves of the farmers, or by private contract by millers and merchants; and, if a &s;mall diminution of the pro|duct be admitted, the diminution of the purcha&s;es will counterbalance it. Be&s;ide, the corn being purcha&s;ed by great contractors to &s;upply govern|ment, they will procure it cheaper than the con|&s;umer, who buys his wheat of the farmer, or even than the merchant in exten&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s; which tends to keep the market lower.</P>
<P>There remains to be con&s;idered only a &s;ingle allegation brought to &s;how that war rai&s;es the price of corn. It is con&s;tended <Q>that war, by dimini&s;h|ing or &s;u&s;pending the increa&s;e of the productive capital of the farmer, prevents his being able to break up and cultivate new lands, or improve the cultivation of old ones.</Q> But this may be produced as an in&s;tance to &s;how how &s;peciou&s;ly a po&s;ition in its general terms may appear, which is totally contrary to fact. If war dimini&s;h the capital of the farmers, it mu&s;t affect equally tho&s;e who re&s;ide near wa&s;te lands proper for inclo&s;ure, and tho&s;e who do not. If the former &s;o abound in capital, that the number of tho&s;e who can enter
<PB N="7" REF="10">on the expen&s;ive operation of breaking up wa&s;te lands be, in war, increa&s;ed beyond any example of a former term of peace, the latter have the ability of pur&s;uing other improvements increa&s;ed in the &s;ame proportion. It appears, on the be&s;t authority, that the number of the bills of inclo&s;ure in the latter half or five years of the la&s;t peace, ex|ceeded that of the former, in the proportion of 17 to 10: Now the number of the&s;e bills in that la&s;t term of five years was 173, and the annual average 34<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;timate, Chalmers, 1794, p. 275, Bills for Inclo&s;ures and Draining, &amp;c. the total of the la&s;t five years was 179. The inclo&s;ing bills of the period were 173.</NOTE>; but in the fir&s;t four years of war, or to the end of 1796, 283, and the yearly average 70<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Report of the Secret Committee of the Hou&s;e of Lords, Appendix. No. 44, p. 245.</NOTE>: the&s;e improvements in the la&s;t peace had exceeded all former precedents; but in war the farmers were able to command a capital &s;ufficient to execute more than twice as much: and they who had occa&s;ion for money for improvements of another kind, in like manner either had it, or were able to acquire it with equal facility. War there|fore had not, until the end of the year 1796, re|tarded the celerity with which improvements in agriculture were going on at the end of the peace: it was, in fact, from that term, greatly accele|rated.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11">From the commencement of 1797 to the pre&s;ent time, the evidence of this point is of another kind: we po&s;&s;e&s;s no documents for tho&s;e years, &s;o particu|lar as the E&s;timate of Mr. Chalmers, or the Report of the Lords' Committee. But immediately before the beginning of the term, the intere&s;t made by pur|cha&s;es in the funds was higher than at any period &s;ince the death of William: the inducement to em|ploy money in the purcha&s;e of fixed income, rather than as productive capital, was therefore greater: but this inducement decrea&s;es the frequency of making an active u&s;e of capital in commerce or agriculture: the facility of acquiring which, in|crea&s;es in proportion as the price of &s;tock in|crea&s;es. And taking the pre&s;ent rate of the three per cents in the market at &pound;63 per cent, it has been augmented, during the term, nearly in the proportion of 4 to 3. The facility therefore of making inclo&s;ures and improvements of land has, &s;ince the beginning of 1797, been greatly aug|mented: inability in the farmers, to make im|provements, occa&s;ioned by the war, cannot there|fore be among the cau&s;es of the high price of corn.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> The Prices of Wheat for the period &s;ince the Revolution, and its divi&s;ion into terms of War and Peace.</HEAD>
<P>THUS rea&s;oning in general terms, there appears ground to infer, that war does not tend to increa&s;e the price of corn. But the evidence ari&s;ing from the compari&s;on of the rates of the market, in the terms of war and peace occurring in a pa&s;t period of &s;ufficient length, is much &s;uperior by its definitive preci&s;ion, and higher in its nature. From that evidence there lies no appeal to other di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of any kind.</P>
<P>The period to be taken for that properly com|mences with the revolution, and terminates with the la&s;t completed period or peace. It was then Great Britain took her natural po&s;ition in the &s;y&s;tem of the European powers, which in con|junction with her individual intere&s;ts, or &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;ts, has determined the frequency, extent, and duration of her &s;ub&s;equent wars, and will con|tinue to determine them.</P>

<P>The prices of the quarter of wheat, to the year 1764 inclu&s;ive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 404. Edit. 3d.</NOTE>, are taken from Dr. Adam Smith's work on the Wealth of Nations: the &s;ame prices have been copied and continued to the pre&s;ent time, by the Rev. S. Hod&s;on<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Appendix to Sermon, "Dearne&s;s occa&s;ioned by Scarcity, not Monopoly," p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&mdash;1800.</NOTE>, but he quotes for it the authority of Smith's Corn Tracts. And the quarter he &s;tates to be of eight &s;tandard Winche&s;|ter bu&s;hels: It is material to add, that in this he is &s;uppo&s;ed here to be correct.(B.)</P>
<P>Mr. Hod&s;on has given a &s;upplement to the tables of Smith, to the end of the year 1798; in which he takes the price of the year 1765 from that of Wind&s;or market; of the following years, to 1770 inclu&s;ive, from Lord Hawke&s;bury's office; and of the remaining years from Mr. Catherwood's tables.</P>
<P>Some remarks are nece&s;&s;ary to be made on the divi&s;ion of the whole period, con&s;i&s;ting of 111 years, into terms of war and peace. The duration of a term of war, is not properly that elap&s;ed be|tween
<PB N="15" REF="18">the formality of its proclamation, and the proclamation of the following peace: it more ac|curately is taken to begin at the fir&s;t noted act of ho&s;tilities, and to end at the day of their ce&s;&s;ation by compact. Be&s;ide, no &s;uch declaration was made of the la&s;t war with France.</P>
<P>Our greater wars only are to be admitted into the account, or all tho&s;e in which that power took part again&s;t us. Our petty ho&s;tilities again&s;t Spain, taking place in the long term between the peace of Utrecht and the year 1740, are totally pa&s;&s;ed by and not admitted as &s;uch. The&s;e, which a &s;atyrical writer in the Craftsman, called "our peaceful wars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Our peaceful wars and warlike peace."&mdash;loc. incert.</NOTE>," are included in the term of 27 years of peace. It is true, war was declared again&s;t Spain in the month of December, 1718: the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment of the navy was at that time 10,000 men<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Po&s;t. Hi&s;t. Rev. p. 114, 121.</NOTE>, and for the years of war 1719, and 1720, there were voted 13,500<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 116, 117.</NOTE>: it was ter|minated in the &s;ummer of 1721. The treaty of Hanover, in 1725, led to new cho&s;tilities again&s;t that power: in 1726, 10,000 men were voted for the navy; and in the following year 20,000: and after &s;ome ineffectual ho&s;tilities, articles of agree|ment were &s;igned in May, 1727. The peace e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the navy was in 1733, of 8000 men;
<PB N="16" REF="19">but in con&s;equence of a di&s;pute breaking out with the &s;ame kingdom in that year, it was increa&s;ed in 1734, to 20,000; and in 1735, to 30,000 men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Po&s;t. Hi&s;t. Rev. p. 131, 133, 159, 161, 163, 165.</NOTE>. The two la&s;t terms of peace together, amounted to twenty two years; but our occa&s;ional armaments were much more important. The&s;e equipments again&s;t Spain therefore are to be con&s;idered only, as &s;maller armaments in a long peace: and the three terms are to be here regarded as wars in name only; for the effects of war in the corn market will be as our exertions; and when tho&s;e are &s;mall, the former will not be di&s;cernible in the prices; being intirely concealed by the much greater effect of the variation of the products of &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>James the &s;econd had a &s;trong army on foot during the whole of the year 1688; and a navy fully equipped for &s;everal months of it. Moreover, the Dutch army was in the kingdom, and their navy in our ports at the conclu&s;ion of it: this is therefore taken as an effective year of war.</P>
<P>The duration of war, determined as above, mu&s;t generally con&s;i&s;t of an integer number of years with an added fraction: for ho&s;tilities may break out nearly at the conclu&s;ion of a certain year; continue uninterrupted for a number of in|tire years, as eight, and terminate in the beginning of the next: thus there will have been war in ten
<PB N="17" REF="20">&s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, but its duration may not be more than nine, or very little exceed eight. A &s;uperior accuracy in tables of this kind might be obtained, by giving an account of the duration of ho&s;tilities in months; but the neglect of it will here produce no di&s;cernible effect on the re&s;ults to be derived from this; where an integer number of years is a&s;&s;igned to every war, approaching the mo&s;t nearly to its true duration.</P>

<P>Hence it appears, that in a period of 106 years, in every war on the average of the whole time, the price of wheat has been 2 &pound;. 2 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI> a quarter; and in every &s;ub&s;equent peace, 2 &pound;. 5 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> the latter rate exeeding the former 5 &pound;. 8 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> &frac12; <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who loudly contend that war rai&s;es the price of corn, must at the &s;ame time admit, that the two different &s;tates of peace and war, have different but permanent and natural effects on the rates of the market: and what tho&s;e effects are they cannot deny to be demon&s;trated by the rates them&s;elves; nor that an average of 106 years is on a &s;cale exten&s;ive enough to exclude the effects of the accidents of &s;ea&s;ons. Or, in other words, that the number of years of great abundance and of great &s;carcity &s;hall be found therein, in the &s;ame proportion to each other, which from natural cau&s;es unknown to us, permanently obtains. And
<PB N="19" REF="22">that therefore the above table exhibits to us what is the true nature of the effect of each &s;tate, and its mea&s;ure, indefinitely near the truth. And the difference of the two &s;tates, if unchecked, will operate in the &s;ame manner and with the &s;ame force in the market, whatever the plenty or the &s;carcity of a year of war may be: that is, keep the proportion of its price in war to that in peace the &s;ame: unle&s;s the danger or apprehen&s;ion of a commotion in war, on account of high prices, may induce the government of a country to u&s;e greater vigilance, and employ more effective mea&s;ures to keep them down. Wherefore if a due com|pari&s;on could be in&s;tituted between the prices of wheat, in two equal terms of years immediately following each other, the fir&s;t of war and the &s;e|cond of peace; in which every circum&s;tance, &s;uch as the product and all others affecting the market (the two &s;tates exclu&s;ively excepted) &s;hould be the &s;ame; the exce&s;s of the rate of the latter term above the former &s;hall be 5 &pound;. 8 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> &frac12; <HI>per centum,</HI> as before determined.</P>
<P>Therefore, taking the price of wheat at this time at 6 &pound;. 6 <HI>s.</HI> the quarter, it appears that if peace had been made in the la&s;t or any preceding year of the war, the market value at the lowe&s;t pro|bable rate, would have exceeded that now taking place by 5 &pound;. 8 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> &frac12; <HI>per cent;</HI> and amounted to 6 &pound;. 12 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d.</HI> or 6 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d.</HI> more: according to the
<PB N="20" REF="23">actual average proportion of the prices of war and peace, which has taken place during 106 years before its commencement (c).</P>
<P>It is &s;een in the table, that there was one term of peace in five, that of 1713, in which the price of corn fell below that of the preceding war; and one of war wherein the average was higher than in the preceding peace, the war of 1755. The con&s;ideration of the&s;e anomalies would run to a length &s;eparating the la&s;t conclu&s;ion too far from that next to be inve&s;tigated, which is very clo&s;ely connected in its nature to it: It is therefore po&s;t|poned for the pre&s;ent.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>One remark is to be made on the formation of this table, before any deductions are drawn from it: the columns mu&s;t contain an equal number of terms, and each line two; the average of a com|pleted term of peace, and of the war which fol|lowed it. Hence that of the peace of 1783 is of nece&s;&s;ity excluded for two rea&s;ons: the average of the war following it is yet unknown; and until it be concluded, it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign it: and &s;econdly, the object of the&s;e inve&s;tigations is to compare the prices of the pre&s;ent war, and their relations, with what experience has pointed out tho&s;e of others to have been for a very long term pa&s;t: therefore in order to in&s;titute that compari&s;on rightly, tho&s;e pa&s;t rates are to be kept apart from the former: for from &s;uch &s;eparate &s;tatement alone
<PB N="22" REF="25">it can be clearly determined, whether the pre&s;ent high prices be the effect of war, as &s;uch, or of other cau&s;es operating at the &s;ame time, and rai&s;ing the market.</P>
<P>This being premi&s;ed, we may proceed to the deductions from the table.</P>
<P>The fifth war ended with the year 1782; whence it appears, that during the whole period of 85 years then elap&s;ed, the average price of the quarter of corn in every term of peace having been 2 &pound;. 5 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> and in the &s;ucceeding war 2 &pound; 1 <HI>s.</HI> the former rate exceeded the latter by 9 &pound; 19 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d. per cent.</HI> And if in any one year of tho&s;e four terms of war, the &s;carcity of corn had been &s;uch, as to have rai&s;ed its price to 6 &pound;. 6 <HI>s.</HI> per quarter; &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ame deficiency, or other circum|&s;tances determining the rate, had taken place in the preceding peace, the &s;elling price would have been 6 &pound; 18 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> &frac12; per quarter: and if &s;uch an event had happened in any year of the la&s;t peace, &s;uch is the price to which wheat would have ri&s;en. Hence if this proportion be applied to the average price of wheat in the la&s;t peace, 2 &pound;. 6 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d.</HI> it will appear, that according to the variation of the term of 85 years found above, that average rate of the following or pre&s;ent war, would not have ex|ceeded 2 &pound;. 1 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> &frac34;. Nor is it to be pre&s;umed that its effect totally differs in nature and kind from the average effect of preceding wars; the difference
<PB N="23" REF="26">therefore between the above rate, and that now obtaining in the market, is to be attributed to cau&s;es independent of the war.</P>
<P>In the former part of the intire period of 106 years, the price of wheat was decrea&s;ing: in the latter it increa&s;ed again, but the re-augmentation appears, upon the face of the table, not to have been equal to the decrement. Thus we &s;ee the mean average of a preceding peace, exceeds that of the intermediate war, by 9&pound;. 19 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d. per cent;</HI> and that of a following peace, exceeds that inter|mediate price, by 5&pound;. 8 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI>&frac12; only: the arith|metic mean of which two rates, is 7&pound;. 13 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI> &frac12; <HI>per cent.</HI> Now by the con&s;truction of the table, the&s;e are the relations of the prices when the ordi|nary circum&s;tances of peace and war obtain: there|fore, when the two terms of peace and the interme|diate war are of the average length, be that what may; whence the lengths of the two terms of peace are to be taken equal. And the average price of every peace, is evidently that of the middle of the term: and the di&s;tance in time from the fir&s;t peace average to the &s;econd, will be compounded of the following three parts: Fir&s;t, the latter half of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r&s;t term of peace; &s;econdly, the whole intermediate term of war; and la&s;tly, the fir&s;t half of the &s;uc|ceeding peace, equal to the latter half of the pre|ceding; becau&s;e their whole terms are equal. And between the extreme in&s;tants of each of the
<PB N="24" REF="27">half terms, or middle of the two terms of peace, a decrement of prices had taken place. Now if peace had continued during the whole of this compounded period, and the decrement had been &s;uppo&s;ed to have gone on equally in every year, which, in that circum&s;tance, is the due a&s;&s;umption; then the price in the middle of the intermediate years, now taken as a term of peace in&s;tead of war, would have been the arith|metic mean between that of the fir&s;t year of the fir&s;t, and the la&s;t of the &s;econd half term of peace as above: which al&s;o would be the average price of the whole intermediate term, if the fir&s;t peace had continued throughout the whole of it; and would have exceeded the actual average of the war by 7&pound;. 13 <HI>s.</HI> 11&frac12; <HI>d. per cent.</HI> taking therefore the price of wheat at any a&s;&s;igned rate in a year of war, if the preceding peace had continued to the end of that year, the rate would have been higher by 7&pound;. 13 <HI>s.</HI> 11&frac12; <HI>d. per cent.</HI> Thus the price of wheat in any year of war being &s;ix guineas a quarter, the price in that year, if peace had been prolonged thereto, would have been 6&pound;. 15 <HI>s.</HI> 8&frac14; <HI>d.;</HI> exceed|ing the former by 9 <HI>s.</HI> 8&frac14; <HI>d.</HI> the quarter.

<P>AMONG ten terms of war and peace a &s;ingle in|&s;tance is found, in which the average price of wheat in peace has fallen below that of the pre|ceding war. That of the peace of 1713 was 2&pound;. 0 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> per quarter, but of the preceding war 2&pound;. 4 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>But the particular circum&s;tances of the account &s;how the &s;eeming irregularity to form no exception to the general conclu&s;ion, that peace does not tend to reduce the price of bread-corn: for from the end of the year 1699 to that of 1744, or during an entire period of forty-five years, a great fall took place in the price of wheat, having been in the fir&s;t term 2&pound;. 12 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> the quarter, and in the la&s;t 1&pound;. 15 <HI>s.</HI> 5 <HI>d.</HI>: and its progre&s;s, it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved, was not uniform but undulating. And in &s;uch a ca&s;e, if the price of the fir&s;t war fall below that of the fir&s;t peace, and the rate ri&s;e again at the beginning of the &s;econd; and after &s;uch fir&s;t increa&s;e it begins again to fall, and the fall be continued a certain number of years, it may at length become le&s;s than the War price: and the operation of the cau&s;es of this decline being
<PB N="26" REF="29">&s;ufficiently further prolonged, the average of the whole term may fall below that of the preceding war; as will appear to have been the ca&s;e in the in&s;tance given above.</P>
<P>For the war of Anne being effectively ended by the ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities in 1712, its average was 2&pound;. 4 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI> Six years of peace followed; the average of which term was 2&pound;. 6 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> In the &s;hort ho&s;tilities, not noticed in the table, which broke out with Spain, that rate amounted to 1&pound;. 16 <HI>s.</HI> 0 <HI>d.</HI> only: and between that and the little war of 1734, there was another term of thirteen years, in which the average price of wheat ro&s;e again 2 <HI>s.</HI> and 11 <HI>d.</HI> the quarter. War recom|menced in 1734; but corn advanced in the two years it continued 2 <HI>s.</HI> the quarter, owing to &s;ome con&s;iderable falling off of the crops of 1735; an event again&s;t which it is not contended that war is a pre&s;ervative. A peace of four years en&s;ued, in which it fell to 1&pound;. 18 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Upon account of the &s;mall &s;cale on which the&s;e wars were carried on, the years in which they took place are, in the general table, included in the long term of twenty-&s;even years of peace. But if the years elap&s;ed between the conclu&s;ion of 1712, and that of 1733, had been divided therein into two terms of peace, and one of war, and their averages taken; the war price of corn would have been found to be le&s;s than either that of the preceding
<PB N="27" REF="30">or following peace. But that of the &s;hort war of 1734 will thus appear anomalous. (E)</P>
<P>To put this in another point of view: it is now to be proved, that taking the duration of the peace of Utrecht at twenty-&s;even years, as in the tables; the price of wheat having been falling from the be|ginning of the peace of Ry&s;wick, to the end of the former; the great war of the Spani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion did not retard that fall.</P>
<P>From the prices of the three terms given, and the duration of each, we are able by a method of calculation fir&s;t given by Sir I&s;aac Newton, to a&s;&s;ign the mo&s;t probable price, on any in&s;tant of time between the middle of the fir&s;t and la&s;t term: and thence to get the prices of the fir&s;t and la&s;t day of the war. (F)</P>
<P>The average price of the war of 1702 (which will be here mo&s;t conveniently &s;o expre&s;&s;ed) was 539 <HI>d.;</HI> and it is to be taken as that of the middle term thereof: and its duration being eleven years, there were five years and a half of it unexpired. The length of the following peace was twenty-&s;even years: of which, at the middle term, there were thirteen years and a half unexpired; when the rate was fallen to 484 <HI>d.:</HI> and the period from the middle of the preceding war to the middle of the peace was nineteen years. Moreover the average price of the term, in the middle of the war of 1740 was 425 <HI>d.;</HI> and the &s;emi-term of war four years
<PB N="28" REF="31">and a half: the di&s;tance of time, therefore, from the middle of the peace to that of the following war, was eighteen years.</P>
<P>From the&s;e elements, proceeding by the method of calculation above referred to, it appears, that at the in&s;tant of the commencement of the peace, or when five years and a half were expired after the middle of the war; the average price of corn is mo&s;t ju&s;tly to be a&s;&s;igned at 523.84 <HI>d.:</HI> and at at the end of the peace, or thirty-two years and a half after that term, it became 440.41 <HI>d.</HI> Its de|crea&s;e therefore, during a peace of twenty-&s;even years, was 83.43 <HI>d.:</HI> or its mean annual decre|ment, 3.09 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Again the price in the middle of the fir&s;t war having been 539 <HI>d.;</HI> and in that of the &s;econd 425 <HI>d.;</HI> the difference was 114 <HI>d;</HI> the &s;um of the decrements of peace and the two half terms of war. And the former having been 83.43 <HI>d.</HI> the lat|ter was 30.57 <HI>d.</HI> But the two whole terms of war having been together twenty years, and the two halves ten; their mean annual decrement was 3.057 <HI>d.:</HI> nearly equal to that of the interven|ing peace, 3.09 <HI>d.:</HI> the former having fallen &s;hort of the latter by 1&pound;. 1 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d. per cent.</HI> only.</P>
<P>By the in&s;pection of the original table it al&s;o appears, that the price of corn ro&s;e, in the war of 1755, above the average of the preceding peace: and that exce&s;s was con&s;iderable, 3 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> the quarter. This &s;eems an objection again&s;t what is
<PB N="29" REF="32">here advanced, on which &s;ome may be di&s;po&s;ed to dwell with pertinacity.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider this in a popular way: it is &s;een by the &s;ame table, that in the term of peace following that war, the average ro&s;e &s;till higher; exceeding that of the war by 7 <HI>s.</HI> 7 <HI>d.</HI> the quarter; or &s;ome|thing more than double the advance taking place in the war. The three terms form a period of twenty-&s;ix years, in which the price of corn was increa&s;ing with con&s;iderable celerity: this mu&s;t have been owing to &s;ome cau&s;e, the effects of which, war, although it could not preclude en|tirely, might by its proper tendency dimini&s;h: and the advance of twelve years in the following peace, having been more than double that of eight years of war, indicates this to have been the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>And the ju&s;tice of this conclu&s;ion is fully proved, by a compari&s;on of the mean annual increment of the price of corn, in the two half terms of the peace of 1749 and 1763, and that of the inter|vening war of 1755. For proceeding as before, we find the price of corn at the middle in&s;tant of the fir&s;t peace, or the beginning of the year 1752, to have been 458 <HI>d.</HI> per quarter: the term of the middle of the war 1755 was &s;even years, and the price 502 <HI>d.:</HI> from thence to the middle of the fol|lowing peace, there elap&s;ed ten years; and the value of corn was now become 593 <HI>d.</HI> Whence by
<PB N="30" REF="33">the Newtonian method of differentials as before, at the end of three years after the middle of the fir&s;t peace, or the in&s;tant of the termination thereof, the price of wheat was become 474.87 <HI>d.;</HI> and at the end of the war, which la&s;ted eight years, or at the end of eleven years after the middle of the fir&s;t peace, that price had increa&s;ed to 534.39 <HI>d.</HI> or its increment in eight years of war, was 59.52 <HI>d.;</HI> the yearly average of which was 7.44 <HI>d.</HI> But the total advance of price, between the middle of the fir&s;t and &s;econd of the&s;e terms of peace, was 135 <HI>d.;</HI> and that of eight years of war having been 59.52 <HI>d.,</HI> that taking place in the nine years of peace, was 75.48 <HI>d.;</HI> and its yearly average 8.38 <HI>d.</HI>&mdash;therefore the annual augmenta|tion in peace, exceeded that in war 12&pound;. 12 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> per cent.</P>
<P>It has been &s;een above, that war does not tend to retard a fall of the price of corn taking place from cau&s;es, be they what they may, operating for long periods: for in the only period, that of the war of 1702, in which &s;uch an effect could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have attended it, the annual mea&s;ures of the fall in war and peace were found to be &s;ub-equal. And as in the other four periods, the price of wheat, in peace, is con&s;tantly found to ri&s;e above that of the preceding war, that equality mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to &s;ome <HI>cau&s;e perturbing</HI> the rates of the market; &s;uch as con&s;iderable variations of the quantity of the
<PB N="31" REF="34">product in the period in which it took place, or other circum&s;tances affecting prices in an unu&s;ual but &s;imilar manner. And as to the re&s;ults of the compari&s;on for the war of 1755, it is to be noted, that although a war appears, in every in&s;tance, to generate a fall, or retard an advance, it cannot to|tally prevent; yet the mea&s;ure of the exce&s;s of the annual augment in peace, above that in war, found for that period 12&pound;. 12 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> per cent. &s;eems al&s;o to have been increa&s;ed by a perturbing cau&s;e, but acting in an oppo&s;ite direction to the former, and affecting the market anomalou&s;ly, and with great &s;trength.</P>
<P>For in all other periods comprehended in the table, except tho&s;e above examined, a fall of prices in war, is con&s;tantly ob&s;erved to take place: and from this it &s;hould follow, that its effects are to accelerate a decrea&s;e, and retard a ri&s;e of prices taking place in peace, which are operations of the &s;ame power. It is now to be inquired, how far this agrees with the two la&s;t re&s;ults combined with each other.</P>
<P>In order to this let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the mea|&s;ure of this effect of war was con&s;tant or equal at both periods above con&s;idered; and that the ef|fects of the perturbing cau&s;es mentioned above, although &s;hewn to be contrary in direction at the two periods, were equal in magnitude: and of the&s;e a&s;&s;umptions, the mo&s;t natural and legitimate
<PB N="32" REF="35">which can be made, let the con&s;equence be &s;ought. Calling here the rate per cent. by which the an|nual increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of prices, actually varied in peace and war, in each of the two periods, its <HI>mea&s;ure of variation;</HI> it follows, that in the fir&s;t period (the perturbing cau&s;e then in operation tending to counteract the effect of war) 1&pound;. 1 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> the actual variation taking place, was the dif|ference of the variations which each acting &s;epa|rately would have produced; but their combined effect having been to retard a fall of rates, that of the perturbing force was the greater of the two. In the &s;econd in&s;tance they acted in conjunction, re|tarding a ri&s;e of rates; and the mea&s;ure of varia|tion, 12&pound;. 12 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> per cent. was the &s;um of their effects. The mea&s;ure of this effect of war therefore, retarding an increa&s;e or accelerating a fall of prices, being the &s;maller of the two, would be a variation equal to half the latter &s;um, dimi|ni&s;hed by half the former, or (6&pound;. 6 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI>&mdash;o&pound;. 10 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d.</HI>) 5&pound;. 15 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> and at this rate per cent. in the pound, on the a&s;&s;umption made above, it would have increa&s;ed the fall of prices in the fir&s;t term, if it had not been counteracted; and dimini&s;hed the fall no more in the &s;econd, if it had not been aided by perturbing cau&s;es; &s;uch as di&s;|ferences of annual product from the average quan|tity, and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ure of the perturbing cau&s;e, equal at
<PB N="33" REF="36">both times in magnitude, being the greater of the two operating forces, was equal to half the &s;um of the ob&s;erved variations, or 6&pound;. 17 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d. per cent.</HI> and hence the truth of the deduction may be proved: for the variation of the annual decrement in war in the fir&s;t period, was equal to the dif|ference of the mea&s;ures here found, 6&pound;. 17 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d.</HI> and 5&pound;. 15 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI>; or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&pound;. 1 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI>: and in the &s;econd to their &s;um, 12&pound;. 12 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d. per cent.</HI></P>
<P>And by &s;ection 4th it was &s;hewn, from the rates of 105 years, that the average price of wheat, in every peace, exceeds that of the pre|ceding war, by 5&pound;. 8 <HI>s.</HI> 8&frac12; <HI>d. per cent.;</HI> very nearly equal to 5&pound;. 15 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.,</HI> the mea&s;ure of the effect of war, thus found to a&s;&s;i&s;t the fall, or coun|teract the increa&s;e of prices.</P>
<P>It will be objected, that this con&s;equence holds only on the a&s;&s;umption of a &s;ingle ca&s;e; that the mea&s;ures of the effect of the perturbing cau&s;es were equal: and that the probability is very little, that they were actually &s;o proportioned at the two pe|riods. To this it may be replied, that thus much is proved hereby, that even the &s;eeming irregula|rities in the table, when combined, give a re&s;ult reconcileable to what is &s;aid of the tendency of war, by making u&s;e of an a&s;&s;umption, the mo&s;t cu&s;tomary and obvious; and therefore no argu|ment again&s;t it re&s;ults from them. But this a&s;&s;ump|tion
<PB N="34" REF="37">of the equality of the perturbing cau&s;es at the two periods, it mu&s;t be further urged, is not nece&s;|&s;ary to obtain probable re&s;ults: they might have been taken unequal; as for example, let the mea&s;ure of that of the fir&s;t period have been 8&pound;. 15 <HI>s.</HI> 7 <HI>d.</HI> and of the &s;econd, 4&pound;. 18 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d. per cent.</HI> From either of the&s;e it follows, that the depre&s;&s;ing power of war was 7&pound;. 13 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d. per cent.</HI> the rate found by the tables, as that by which the price of wheat in a year of war, would have been exceeded by the rate of the market, if the preceding peace had been continued to that term: and it is only nece&s;&s;ary, that the mea&s;ure of the effect of the fir&s;t perturb|ing cau&s;e be taken at more than 1&pound;. 1 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> and le&s;s than 12&pound;. 12 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d. per cent.</HI> in order to obtain a &s;eries of other re&s;ults, alike con&s;i&s;tent with what is &s;aid of this tendency of war. Within the&s;e limits, the a&s;&s;umptions which may be made are in number infinite; and the mea&s;ures of the two powers may be taken in any po&s;&s;ible propor|tion between the numbers 261 and 1879.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VII.</HI> On the decrea&s;e of the Price of the Quarter of Wheat to the War of <HI>1740,</HI> and its &s;ub&s;equent advance; and on their Magnitudes.</HEAD>
<P>THE original table contains the prices of wheat for 105 years: that period is apparently divided into two great parts, hitherto uncon&s;idered. In the fir&s;t the price of wheat was decrea&s;ing: and as the nature of the &s;ubject determined it, with an undulating diminution. In the &s;econd part, in ap|pears to have become reaugmented in a manner the conver&s;e of the former: a divi&s;ion, the con&s;e|quences of which de&s;erve attention.</P>
<P>The prices of wheat in the years 1743 and 1744 are the lowe&s;t in the whole table: and if we re|&s;pect intirely entries of &s;ingle years, we mu&s;t fix the minimum, or lowe&s;t price of the period com|prized in it, between them; and at the end of the former year. But the rates of &s;ingle years are too much affected by &s;ea&s;ons and other accidents of the market, to fix from them the boundaries of great periods: and recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to the more accurate method of interpolation, which has before been applied to the &s;ubject. From the in|&s;pection of the table it is evident, that the lowe&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="39">price took place, in &s;ome one year, between the mid|dle of the &s;econd peace and that of the third; two terms of time di&s;tant twenty one years: the prices of which are determined from tho&s;e of thirty-three years given. And from the&s;e, and that of the intermediate war, this minimum or lowe&s;t price, and its period, are to be a&s;&s;igned; which will be thus determined from the prices of forty-two years. And in &s;o long a period, the anomalies of the market, ari&s;ing from the &s;ingular &s;carcity or abundance of particular years, and &s;uch other cau&s;es as accidentally depre&s;s or rai&s;e its rates; being probably equally mixed, will counterbalance and de&s;troy each other; and thus the re&s;ults ob|tained will approximate nearly enough to tho&s;e which would have been found, if the permanent cau&s;es of the progre&s;&s;ive variations had operated without di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>The middle of the year 1726, (or 1725&frac12;) was that of the &s;econd peace; the duration of the &s;econd half was thirteen years and a half; and the price of wheat at that time was 484 <HI>d.</HI> the quarter: the following war la&s;ted nine years; the price at the middle in&s;tant whereof was 425 <HI>d.</HI> and its di&s;tance from that of the fir&s;t peace eighteen years: there remained of the term four years and a half; and the half of the next or third peace was three years; the di&s;|tance between which, and the middle of the pre|ceding war, was &s;even years and a half. And the
<PB N="37" REF="40">price of wheat at the end of the third year of peace; was 458 <HI>d.</HI> pence. Now with the&s;e elements pro|ceeding as before, the price for every term of the whole period of twenty-five years and a half will be found: and when 14.4 years of this period were expired, the price of wheat, according to the equation of the term, was fallen to 421 <HI>d.</HI> or 1 <HI>&pound;.</HI> 15 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> per quarter; the lowe&s;t rate or minimum thereof (1). Hence, whatever rates are &s;een in the table below that minimum; their depre&s;&s;ion is to be attributed to the variations of the &s;ea&s;ons and markets from their average &s;tate: and the lowe&s;t depre&s;|&s;ion of the market, is mo&s;t truly to be taken to have been at the end of the year 1740 (1739. 9)</P>
<P>And, if the whole period of 105 years com|pri&s;ed in the table, be divided into two equal parts, the divi&s;ion will fall in the middle of the year 1740, being extremely near to the term of the lowe&s;t price a&s;&s;igned above. Therefore as all other con&s;iderations &s;et a&s;ide, this divi&s;ion into equal periods is familiarized to us by cu&s;tom, and approaches very near to that which is mo&s;t accu|rate, it is here exclu&s;ively followed: no further re|gard being paid, either to the true in&s;tant of the minimum by interpolation, or that exhibited by the original table.</P>
<P>This being taken as a proper divi&s;ion of the period, the variation of a its prices &s;hall be now ex|amined; fir&s;t by comparing the average of the
<PB N="38" REF="41">two equal terms it contains; and &s;econdly, the ce|lerity of the fall of the fir&s;t, and that of the ad|vance taking place in the &s;econd.</P>
<P>The number of years contained in the table to the end of the la&s;t peace are 105; the &s;um of the fir&s;t fifty-two prices, with the half of the fifty-third, or that of the year 1740, 1&pound;. 5 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> is 116&pound;. 7 <HI>s.</HI> and the average of the term, being of fifty-two years and a half, 2&pound;. 4 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> The like &s;um of the prices of the la&s;t fifty-two years and a half, is 112&pound;. 10 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> and the average 2&pound;. 2 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d.</HI> Whence the average price of wheat in the fir&s;t term exceeded that of the la&s;t, by 1 <HI>s.</HI> 5 <HI>d.</HI> the quarter; and by 3&pound;. 6 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d. per cent.</HI></P>
<P>The celerity of the fall in the fir&s;t term, and of the advance in the &s;econd, is thus found. The price of wheat in the middle of the war of the re|volution, or at the end of the year 1692, was the average of that term, 2&pound;. 10 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> In forty-&s;even years and a half after, or in the middle of the year 1740, it fell to its lowe&s;t rate: but this is to be determined, not from the actual price of the year, but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound for it by the interpolation of three terms of peace and war, each of con&s;iderable du|ration, which is thus to be taken as 1&pound;. 15 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> the amount of the minimum determined by another mode above. The total fall therefore in forty-&s;even years and a half, was 15 <HI>s.</HI> 7 <HI>d.</HI> and the an|nual average decrement of prices 3.936 <HI>d.</HI> In the
<PB N="39" REF="42">middle of the la&s;t peace, or at the end of the year 1787, the price of wheat per quarter was 2&pound;. 6 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d.</HI> the augment was 11 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> and the term in which it was generated forty-&s;even years and a half: whence the mean annual augment of prices was 2.8 <HI>d.</HI> and the annual fall of prices in the fir&s;t term, exceeded the advance in the &s;econd, by 40&pound;. 11 <HI>s.</HI> 5 <HI>d. per cent</HI> (K).</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VIII.</HI> On the Cau&s;es of this fall of the Markets, and of their &s;ub&s;equent advance; and on &s;ome of their con&s;equences.</HEAD>
<P>THE mea&s;ures of this advance and fall of the price of wheat having been a&s;&s;igned, in conclu&s;ion &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the cau&s;es and effects thereof will be given. Dr. Adam Smith con&s;iders the de|crement of the fir&s;t period, as a proof of an increa&s;e of the value of the precious metals commencing long before the revolution. Nor is this incon&s;i&s;tent, as it may be at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected, with a fact which mu&s;t be admitted, &s;ome increa&s;e of the national coin during the whole period of the fall: for if the national product had been increa&s;ed in that period
<PB N="40" REF="43">with greater celerity, prices mu&s;t fall, or the value of coin increa&s;e; in the &s;ame manner, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, as a like increa&s;e of the value of money and fall of prices mu&s;t take place; if the product were to remain unincrea&s;ed, while the quantity of coin is dimini&s;hed: for in both ca&s;es alike, a relative decrea&s;e, a decrement of the propor|tion of money to commodities takes place: and the variation of prices depends on the variation of the proportion, not of the ab&s;olute quantity of each.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that after the quantity of the precious metals annually imported has been for a cour&s;e of years fixed; the latter imports may increa&s;e the &s;tock of money in the general market of Europe very little. For that &s;tock being toward the end of the term con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, its wa&s;te by wear will al&s;o be increa&s;ed in the &s;ame proportion; together with its diminution by acci|dents; as ca&s;ual lo&s;&s;es, fires, and &s;hipwrecks. Some coin is melted down, and together with much bullion wa&s;ted by the arts: and the di|minution in the la&s;t mode will be perpetually in|crea&s;ing, by the relative fall of the price of the metals, compared with that of every other thing. Moreover from the revolution to the year 1740, the bullion exported to China and India, from Britain and the re&s;t of Europe, was annually aug|menting: and it has been well ob&s;erved, that the Europeans dig &s;ilver in the We&s;t, to carry it to be buried in the Ea&s;t. Hence even the in|crea&s;e
<PB N="41" REF="44">of the quantity of coin in a &s;tate, might go on with a celerity perpetually retarded, until it ul|timately cea&s;ed; although its imports of the pre|cious metals were every year equal.</P>
<P>Thus, equal quantities of bullion dug from the mines, will increa&s;e the European &s;tock of coin by an annual augment perpetually decrea&s;ing. But if it all were converted into money, not &s;ubject to wear, exportation, or accidental lo&s;s; the annual increa&s;e of the &s;tock being perpetually equal in amount, its increa&s;e <HI>per cent.</HI> would be perpetually dimini&s;hed: and the truth of this po&s;ition may be very ea&s;ily &s;hown. Monte&s;quieu &s;ays, that by the di&s;covery of America, the &s;tock of money was increa&s;ed in two centuries, in the proportion of thirty-two to unity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;prit des Loix, l. 21. c. 22.</NOTE>; and he con&s;iders this to have been effected by equal annual imports; which con|&s;equently amounted to 16&pound;. <HI>per cent.</HI> of the initial &s;tock annually. This &s;eems too great an increa&s;e, even for an a&s;&s;umption to illu&s;trate this propo&s;ition. Let it therefore for that purpo&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the average annual import has been 1/20 or 5&pound;. <HI>per cent.</HI> of the initial European &s;tock of coin: and that this influx commenced with the conque&s;t of Peru, in the year 1532: then the con&s;tant annual augment being taken as five, and the original &s;tock of coins as 100, it mu&s;t have been as follows:

<P>Thus the ratio of the increa&s;e to the &s;tock will be perpetually dimini&s;hing, and at fir&s;t rapidly: it is only when that proportion becomes very minute, that the annual augment <HI>per cent.</HI> approaches to equality. But there are two cau&s;es which will &s;top that augment altogether: Fir&s;t, the decrea&s;e of coin by wear, ca&s;ualties and the export to the ea&s;t, which jointly may be taken at a fixed rate <HI>per cen|tum</HI> of its whole amount: let the yearly aggre|gate of all the&s;e be only &frac12;&pound;. <HI>per cent.</HI> of the whole coin; the ratios of the annual augments to the &s;tock in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods, are the terms of the reciprocal &s;eries, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4&pound;. &amp;c. <HI>per cent.</HI> the tenth term of which is 5/10&pound;. or one half <HI>per cent.</HI> Thus the annual augment of the coin will ulti|mately become equal to its annual decrea&s;e: and the final &s;tock will be as 1,100 or eleven times the initial &s;tock. An event which would by this hypo|the&s;is for illu&s;tration, have taken place in 200 years after the conque&s;t of Peru, or in the Year 1732.</P>
<P>But there are cau&s;es both accelerating and retard|ing this period. Among the accelerating cau&s;es, one of the mo&s;t powerful is, the increa&s;e of the
<PB N="43" REF="46">&s;tock of metal it&s;elf: and if the quantity of com|modities to be purcha&s;ed by it, continue fixed or increa&s;e in a le&s;s proportion than coin; the real value for which this univer&s;al equivalent will ex|change, will perpetually dimini&s;h. And the ftock of money, compared with commodities, will probably increa&s;e with as great celerity in the country of the mines, by what is retained for its u&s;e, as in Europe: and if Dr. Smith had been followed here, it might be affirmed, with greater. Thus the charge of working the mines will increa&s;e, and even the undertaker's remainder thus dimini&s;hed be reduced in proportional value to him; and if at fir&s;t the &s;hare of the miner, after paying the king's tax, were eight times the charge of procuring the metal; and prices ro&s;e as in Europe; after eight periods of twenty years, the expence of working a mine becoming eight times as much, would equal his &s;hare of the product; the tax being here con&s;tantly taken to continue unreduced. And the quantity of his &s;urplus would be in each &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive period, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 eighths of the exce&s;s of the product above the tax. But the value of the metals falling, as the terms of the reciprocal &s;eries 1, &frac12;, &frac13;, &amp;c. the value of his &s;ur|plus, or the quantity of commodities it will pro|cure him, will in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive terms be as tho&s;e of the &s;eries, 7/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 6/2, 5/3, 4/4, &frac35;, 2/6, 1/7, 0/8: And the work|ing of the mines mu&s;t be abandoned, long before
<PB N="44" REF="47">the end of the term; but if the advance of prices in America, con&s;tantly follow that of Europe at a certain di&s;tance, as twenty or thirty years; the period of working the mines will be protracted &s;o much longer.</P>
<P>But there are cau&s;es al&s;o retarding this term: the total quantity of gold to be divided between the king and the adventurer remaining the &s;ame, whatever increa&s;es the &s;hare of the latter, dimi|ni&s;hes the charge of extracting it, or makes it ab|&s;olutely of greater value to him, will encourage him to continue his undertaking. Reductions of the king's tax are of the fir&s;t kind; improvements in the proce&s;s of the extraction of the metals are of the &s;econd; and an increa&s;e of the product of other branches of indu&s;try, and principally &s;uch improvements, as procure greater products from the &s;ame quantity of labour, are of the la&s;t. And the&s;e may go on for many years, at particular periods; &s;o that the general quantity of products &s;hall increa&s;e with greater celerity than that of coin, although con&s;tantly augmented: thus the latter will ri&s;e again in its value; and the &s;hare of the proprietor of the mine, though not increa&s;ed, become more valuable to him.</P>
<P>And to the miner, the ultimate effects of each of the&s;e are alike; but they are very different on the prices of commodities. The la&s;t reduces them; the two fir&s;t by &s;udden augmentations of
<PB N="45" REF="48">the profits of mining, enable former adventurers to increa&s;e their undertakings, and attract new capital to new ones; increa&s;ing the product of the metals, and accelerating the fall of money.</P>
<P>Since the di&s;covery of America, the product of the mines has generally increa&s;ed with more cele|rity, than that of the products of Europe: whence on the whole, there has been a great in|crea&s;e of prices. There may al&s;o have been periods, in which &s;uch products have increa&s;ed fa&s;te&s;t: the proportion of the augments of each has al&s;o frequently varied: &s;o that the line de|&s;cribing the fall of the value of money will be un|dulated, and even have &s;ome points of retro|gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, as explained above, while the quantity of coin in a &s;tate ab&s;olutely increa&s;es, if its product be augmented with greater celerity, it relatively falls, and the price of corn with it. This was our &s;tate from 1688 to 1740: and the fall is accounted for on the &s;ame principle by Dr. A. Smith, al|though he takes it as terminating later. But an increa&s;e of the produce of the mines will rai&s;e again the rates of the market, and they will con|tinue ri&s;ing, until the annual import of the metals, &s;uppo&s;ed again uniform but of a greater amount, &s;hall have produced its utmo&s;t effect.</P>
<P>It is to &s;uch an augmentation, which was not heeded by that writer, that the increa&s;e of the
<PB N="46" REF="49">price of wheat during the latter half of the term here con&s;idered, is to be attributed.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this event, from the facts I have been able to collect, is as follows.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dod&s;ley's Annual Regi&s;ter, 1783, part 3, p. 165, 166.</NOTE> In the year 1723, the court of Spain determined to reduce the duties paid on the precious metals, at the mint of Goanaxuato in Mexico. They probably had imagined, that by a reduction of the duties, the increa&s;e of the quantity would be &s;uch, as even to produce a con&s;iderable increa&s;e of the revenue. The quantity of the gold and &s;ilver brought an|nually to this mint, was, on an average of &s;ixty-five years before the experiment, in value 193, 103&pound;. &s;terling. It was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">refore &s;ufficient for a trial of the mea&s;ure upon an adequate &s;cale, and that with little hazard to the general amount of the tax on the mines. The aggregate duties on gold bullion were then reduced from 227/10 to 12&frac23; <HI>per cent;</HI> and on the &s;ilver in ingots, from 20 and 22 <HI>per cent,</HI> to a rate varying from 127/24 to 102/15 <HI>per cent,</HI> at different periods.</P>
<P>In Dod&s;ley's annual regi&s;ter of the year 1783, there is a table &s;hewing the weight of gold and &s;ilver, on which duties have been paid, by the accounts made up every five years, from 1665 to 1778 each inclu&s;ive, being an ab|&s;tract of the King's books at the mint. This

<P>The yearly average of the metals in the fir&s;t period having been 193,103&pound;. and of the &s;econd 657,425&pound;. the increa&s;e was in the proportion of 340.45 to 100, or about 240&frac12;&pound;. <HI>per cent.</HI> Now the mean tax on each of the metals for the fir&s;t period, may be well enough taken at 2155/100 <HI>per cent,</HI> and for the &s;econd at 1247/100; thus it appears in 1723 to have been reduced nearly in the ratio of 57 to 100: and the product of the duties in the fir&s;t period was 42,192&pound;. &s;terling, and in the &s;econd 81,980&pound;. having been increa&s;ed 94&pound;. 6 <HI>s. per cent.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="51">In the original table two columns are added under the titles of duties on &s;ilver and duties on gold: on a due compari&s;on with the value of the metals for which the&s;e duties were paid, they are found both before and after the year 1723, to have been nearly at the equal rate of 1&frac12;&pound;. <HI>per cent</HI> on the total of that value. The columns are therefore the amount of the &s;overeignty duty mentioned in the memoir (L); a di&s;tinct payment from the greater taxes of the fifth and tenth of the amount; of which the table contains nothing.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of this operation determined the crown of Spain to extend the reduction of the duty to all the mints of America: for we find, that the tax upon &s;ilver in Peru, was in the year 1736 reduced from one fifth to one tenth of the metals ex|tracted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wealth of Nations, v. i. p. 315.</NOTE> This mea&s;ure mu&s;t have produced great ef|fects on the quantity of the annual product: for tho&s;e who before entered the product of their mines legally, mu&s;t certainly then have derived &s;ome profit from them: its rate was now increa&s;ed 10&pound;. <HI>per cent;</HI> and they extended and multiplied their adventures. The mu&s;t likewi&s;e have been a numerous cla&s;s of men in tho&s;e colonies, whom the legal gain could not before induce to embark in the &s;earch and
<PB N="49" REF="52">working of mines, and who would not run the &s;muggler's hazard; whom this great addition to the regular profits of mining, induced to embark in it. The additional product of the adventurers of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, and the intire product of that of the &s;econd, is a real augmentation of the metals dug up every year; a great part of which mu&s;t have increa&s;ed the European import.</P>
<P>The augmentation however cannot be equal to that of the quantity paying duty: part will be retained in America for the u&s;e of the coloni&s;ts: and many engaged in the clande&s;tine trade, when the &s;uperiority of its profits were dimini&s;hed &pound;. 10 <HI>per cent,</HI> mu&s;t have declined the the hazard of continuing it, and brought their gold and &s;ilver to the mints according to law. But their works, before clande&s;tinely carried on, being now openly wrought, would be continued on a larger &s;cale: and here an ab&s;olute increa&s;e of pro|duct would be obtained. Yet &s;till the remaining tax of &pound;. 10 <HI>per cent,</HI> might operate with con&s;idera|ble power, and much gold and &s;ilver would con|tinue to be &s;muggled. And hence it is to be concluded, that the reduction of the tax in Peru, had con&s;equences &s;imilar to tho&s;e, which followed the previous adoption of that mea&s;ure at Goan|axuato; although the augmentation of the metals paying duty, might fall in &s;ome proportion which
<PB N="50" REF="53">cannot be a&s;&s;igned, below that which followed the reduction of 1723. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Portugue&s;e do not &s;eem either to have anticipated or copied this great mea&s;ure. In 1761, the tax on the mines of the Brazils was one fifth of the metal extracted. Account of the European &s;ettlements, probably written by Mr. William Burke, 5th edit. 1770, p. 313.</NOTE></P>
<P>In four years after the diminution of the tax in Peru, which took place in 1736; or clo&s;ely ad|hering to the yearly prices in the fir&s;t corn table, in &s;even years and a half; the augmented import of the metals began to produce its natural effect in our corn market; and continued to augment its prices, until it had rai&s;ed them, to the highe&s;t rate the new annual &s;upply of the metals could &s;upport. This took place about the beginning of 1769, ac|cording to the fir&s;t table.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t half of the term compri&s;ed therein, the improvements in agriculture and its product being progre&s;&s;ive, the demand for the precious metals was increa&s;ing; the annual &s;upply being fixed, or perhaps decrea&s;ing from its nature, as ex|plained above. Hence the price of corn fell, but that annual &s;upply ri&s;ing <HI>per &s;altum</HI> in 1736, with greater celerity than the products of agriculture, the value of the metals mu&s;t have begun to fall. The ju&s;tice of this principle is recognized by
<PB N="51" REF="54">Smith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wealth of Nations, v. i, p. 275.</NOTE>. He al&s;o repeatedly mentions the reduc|tion of the duties upon gold and &s;ilver in 1736. But he enters into no inquiry into the effect of that mea&s;ure, upon the annual &s;upply of Europe: and when he comes to con&s;ider the prices of corn, from 1688 to the peace of 1763, and the import of the metals conjointly; he all along proceeds upon an a&s;&s;umption tacitly made, that this import con|tinued uniform. This led him to attribute the ri&s;e of prices actually commencing about 1740, and continued according to his tables to the year 1764, to a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of indifferent or bad &s;ea&s;ons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wealth of Nations, v. i., p. 310.</NOTE>; not for ten or twelve years, but for twenty-four; a cir|cum&s;tance not to be lightly admitted. But as the prices of corn were &s;upported, at a rate not much inferior to what it had ri&s;en to, to the end of the la&s;t peace, or for a further term of twenty-eight years; and the continuance of the effect, mu&s;t ari&s;e from the continuance of the &s;ame cau&s;e; the error of his account of that ri&s;e of the corn mar|ket, is now, much more obvious, than at the time of his writing.</P>
<P>To conclude the&s;e remarks on the cau&s;e of the ri&s;e of market rates, after the year 1740. By the table, of the accounts of the mint of Goanaxuato, it ap|pears, that the intire &s;ucce&s;s of the operation of
<PB N="52" REF="55">1736, had induced the court of Spain in September 1777, to try what would be the effect of re|ducing the duties on gold and &s;ilver &s;till further. That on gold bullion was lowered from 12&frac23; to three <HI>per cent;</HI> and the &s;eignorage taken off &s;ilver. The quantity of both, on which the duties were paid, is given in the la&s;t article of the table, for four years only, ending with 1778; including 2&frac34; years at the old, and five quarters at the reduced rates. And as far as any con&s;equences can be drawn from the experience of &s;o &s;hort a period, the increa&s;e of the product of the mines by this &s;econd mea&s;ure, may be expected nearly to equal that of the fir&s;t (M): for there is little probability that in the following years it became le&s;s effective. This &s;econd experiment had undoubtedly the &s;ame ob|ject as the fir&s;t; and if it &s;ucceeded, it mu&s;t be in|ferred, it was in like manner copied in Peru, in &s;ome period of the la&s;t peace. This &s;oon pro|duced a &s;econd important augmentation of the Spani&s;h import of the precious metals, which in five or &s;ix years again affected the corn market of Britain; and continuing its operation, is now a &s;trong and concurring cau&s;e of the high prices of wheat in the pre&s;ent war. For the reduction of the tax on the metal in Peru, in 1736, is to be taken by the table, to have produced its utmo&s;t effect in the wheat market, about the middle of the peace
<PB N="53" REF="56">of 1763; or the year 1768, or in thirty-two years.</P>
<P>But Robert&s;on, in his Hi&s;tory of America, has pointed out another probable &s;ource of the increa&s;e of the influx of gold and &s;ilver into Europe, "but little known" to us at the time of his writing: and of which he &s;ays, it "may be productive of great effects;" and that "it merits attention:" and it certainly merits it here. In the year 1765, the Spaniards, engaged in a war with the Indians on the borders of Mexico, were led into the mountainous di&s;tricts of the province of Sonora; and <Q>in the cour&s;e of this &s;ervice, marched through countries into which they &s;eem not to have penetrated before that time, and di&s;covered mines of &s;uch value, as was a&s;toni&s;hing even to men acquainted with the riches contained in the mountains of the new world. At Cineguilla, in that province, they en|tered a plain of fourteen leagues in extent, in which they found gold in grains at the depth of only &s;ixteen inches, of &s;uch a &s;ize that &s;ome of them weighed nine marks, and in &s;uch quantities, that in a &s;hort time, with a few labourers, they col|lected a thou&s;and marks of gold in grains, even without taking time to wa&s;h the earth that had been dug, which appeared to be &s;o rich, that per&s;ons of &s;kill computed that it might yield what would be equal in value to a million of Pezos (N). Before the end of the year 1771,
<PB N="54" REF="57">above two thou&s;and per&s;ons were &s;ettled there, under the government of proper magi&s;trates.</Q> He adds, <Q>as &s;everal other mines, not inferior in riches, have been di&s;covered both in Sonora and Cinaloa, it is probable, that the&s;e neglected and thinly-inhabited provinces, may &s;oon become as populous and valuable, as any part of the Spani&s;h empire in America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of America, v. iii, p. 262, 8vo, 3d edit.</NOTE>.</Q> It is evident, that the great effects Robert&s;on had in contemplation when he wrote, were tho&s;e of a future fall of the value of money: which the experience of above a century, &s;hows to be more manife&s;ted by the increa&s;e of the rates of the wheat market in peace than in war, the product of the year being equal in each; be it either deficient; of the average quantity; or even abundant.</P>
<P>But to what has been &s;aid of the increa&s;e of the European import of the metals, one objection will be urged. It appears by the evidence of Sir John Hort, who had many years been his Maje&s;ty's con|&s;ul at Li&s;bon, which was delivered before the Lords' Committee, on the &s;toppage of payments in ca&s;h at the Bank, that <Q>the raw articles of the Brazils have been greatly increa&s;ed of late years, and con&s;equently, that con&s;iderable &s;ums of gold have been &s;ent back to that country from Por|tugal, in payment of its debts and balances.
<PB N="55" REF="58">This naturally, (he ob&s;erves,) &s;hould dimini&s;h the import of gold into Portugal, <HI>but of this fact,</HI> (he adds,) <HI>he is not informed.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Yet it will be &s;een that this leaves it intirely un|certain whether the quantity of the metals from the Portugue&s;e mines, re&s;ting in Europe, be in|crea&s;ed or dimini&s;hed. For by his evidence it ap|pears, that in his opinion, the annual import of the metals is al&s;o increa&s;ed. <Q>Some of the mines, he informed the committee, are under&s;tood to have decayed in their produce, but <HI>new ones to a con&s;iderable amount</HI> have been opened.</Q> And on the whole he concludes, <Q>the importation of gold from Brazil to Portugal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Report, p. 101.</NOTE> to have been <HI>at lea&s;t equal</HI> to what it has been for many years.</Q> This mode of &s;peaking admits an increa&s;e to be mo&s;t probable, but &s;ugge&s;ts nothing as to its mag|nitude. And be&s;ide it appears by the &s;ame evi|dence, that the total <Q>quantity is kept &s;ecret, and has been particularly &s;o for &s;ome years pa&s;t.</Q> It does not follow from this, that even the increa&s;e of the import of bullion does not exceed that of the adver&s;e balance of the export of commodities, if &s;uch a balance have taken place; and con&s;e|quently not that it equals the former; or much le&s;s that it con&s;iderably exceeds it: which latter mu&s;t be affirmed, or the objection, if allowed, is of little weight. From this evidence it cannot there|fore
<PB N="56" REF="59">be maintained, that the yearly re&s;ting balance in Portugal is decrea&s;ed. And that of Mr. Whit|more, the principal part of who&s;e tran&s;actions had been remittances from Portugal in coin and bul|lion for twenty-five years, leaves the matter in the &s;ame uncertainty. He &s;tates him&s;elf to have <Q>rea&s;on to believe that coin has gone back from Portugal to the Brazils; but declares he can &s;ay nothing as to the quantity imported<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Report, p. 105.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It is moreover to be ob&s;erved, that the reflux of coin into the Brazils, is not a legitimate proof of the overbalance of its commodities again&s;t Por|tugal, in the ca&s;e &s;tated to obtain: for (if it exi&s;t) it depends upon circum&s;tances, from which the &s;ame effect mu&s;t follow likewi&s;e in the oppo&s;ite ca&s;e. While the bullion coming annually from Brazil exceeds the value of the coin returned, which is here admitted; no &s;uch return would take place, unle&s;s the exertions of the two provincial mints of Rio Janeiro and the bay of All Saints, were totally inadequate to the commerce of the colony; or no proper exchange were e&s;tabli&s;hed between it and the mother country; whereby the export of a great and &s;uperfluous quantity of bullion by the former, and of coin by the latter the following year, mu&s;t take place: when the bu&s;ine&s;s might have been done by the &s;imple<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Philof. et Pol. Raynal, v. iii, 409, edit. 1770, Am&s;t.</NOTE>
<PB N="57" REF="60">tran&s;it of the difference. This bringing of gold acro&s;s the Atlantic, and &s;ending it back again in the &s;hape of coin, is only a proof that the debts on both &s;ides are liquidated in a bad manner; but not that the annual balance is either increa&s;ing or de|crea&s;ing. And there is &s;ome rea&s;on to conjecture a &s;top has been put to the mints in the Brazils: for it appears, coin was formerly imported into Por|tugal from them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Report, p. 105.</NOTE>: but at pre&s;ent, we have the te&s;timony of Sir John Hort, that gold comes over only in bars and du&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 103.</NOTE>. And as a rea&s;on why the import of coin was le&s;&s;ened, Mr. Whitmore alledged, that all the gold pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>King's mint</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 105.</NOTE>: by which it is to be naturally under&s;tood, not the provincial mints, but that of the mother country. Now Smith ob&s;erves, that the greate&s;t cu&s;tomers for the new coin of American gold, are the inhabitants of the gold colonies: if Por|tugal therefore undertook to &s;upply her own, &s;he of nece&s;&s;ity was obliged to begin to export it to them; but at the &s;ame time, her own im|port was increa&s;ed by the metal formerly coined in her &s;ettlements. And the recently flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the Brazils, proved by the increa&s;e of its commodities, has probably drawn the magnitude of this reflux of gold more di&s;tinctly into notice.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61">In fine, a con&s;iderable increa&s;e of the balance of the value of commodities, in the trade between Portugue&s;e America and Europe, may be admitted in favor of the former, and even &s;ome diminution of its export of gold; yet it will not nearly equal the probable increa&s;e of the European import of bul|lion from Spani&s;h America.</P>
<P>Other cau&s;es have concurred to render this cala|mity of the weight we feel it to be: the de&s;olation which the incur&s;ions of France have &s;pread over the fine&s;t provinces of Flanders, Germany, and Italy, have greatly dimini&s;hed their product: and in&s;tead of our being able to draw any &s;upplies from them to relieve our nece&s;&s;ities, they mo&s;t probably them|&s;elves are obliged to &s;acrifice &s;ome part of the re|mainder of the &s;pecie or effects rapine has left them, for their own &s;upply: and they are become competitors with us in other foreign markets to a certain degree. The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Naples will call for mo&s;t of the corn the known fertility of Sicily can &s;pare: nor are the ravages of Egypt and Syria, without their circuitous con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The la&s;t calamities of Poland deprived us of much of the &s;uccour, we might have derived from thence to alleviate the burthen we labour under: and they far exceeded tho&s;e produced by its fir&s;t internal commotions, to which Dr. A. Smith a&s;cribed con&s;iderable effect in our corn market. It our protection and that of Pru&s;&s;ia could have
<PB N="59" REF="62">been continued to the &s;oberly ameliorated con&s;titu|tion of that country, it might have been now &s;o far recovered, as to have become in this hour of our nece&s;&s;ity, the granary of Britain, as it has for|merly been of Europe. But for that protection the junction of both tho&s;e great powers was nece&s;&s;ary. The criminal intrigues of an individual rai&s;ed an impolitic clamour again&s;t this junction at home: by his known agent abroad, he oppo&s;ed and in part defeated the negociations of his country. Thus by a treachery to his uncon&s;cious party, of which he was the often&s;ible leader in a certain a&s;&s;embly, he expo&s;ed them to the hazard of the reproach of be|coming a Ru&s;&s;ian faction there, and of having lowered them&s;elves to the level of Swedi&s;h &s;enators, pen&s;ioners of that power; he delivered over the un|fortunate kingdom, to the &s;words of the depo&s;ers and the foreign enemies of its king; and de&s;troyed the ample and broad foundation of amound which poli|tical wi&s;dom had laid, and mu&s;t have completed, to &s;top a new deluge from the North, perpetually threatening to overflow all Europe. For Pru&s;&s;ia di&s;|graced, injured, and irritated, by this forced de&s;ertion of the Briti&s;h government, and not over &s;olicitous of the ju&s;tice of the means whereby it &s;hould gratify its re&s;entment, and indemnify it&s;elf for its pa&s;t expences incurred, joined ultimately to de&s;troy that con&s;titution, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of which it had &s;o much promoted, and to divide the unhappy
<PB N="60" REF="63">kingdom with its former antagoni&s;t. A con&s;idera|ble part of a nation &s;eldom falls into great political errors, without experiencing the bad effect of them in &s;ome &s;hape: our ungrounded clamours again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ian armament, contributed to di&s;&s;olve our: connection with Pru&s;&s;ia, to make Poland the &s;cene of new revolutions, and at la&s;t to deliver her to the dominion of foreign conquerors: the deva&s;tations which then laid that country wa&s;te, which had been much harra&s;&s;ed and afflicted before, render it totally unable to be of any con&s;iderable aid to us, in the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on of our di&s;tre&s;s for corn.</P>
<P>Among the con&s;equences of the fall of prices, which has been &s;hewn to have continued for half a century, there is one which is of weight enough at this cri&s;is to de&s;erve to be entered into. Until the year 1765 we had a great export trade of corn; &s;ince the year 1771 a con&s;tant import has been ne|ce&s;&s;ary for our &s;upply<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hod&s;on's Sermon, Appendix, p. 29.</NOTE>; in the interval, the balance of import and export may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been fluctuating.</P>
<P>Two cau&s;es may be a&s;&s;igned for this; the fir&s;t of which &s;hall be barely &s;tated, without entering into any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion upon it. Although the number of the inhabitants of the villages be increa&s;ed, to|gether with their &s;kill in agriculture, whereby its product is con&s;iderably augmented; yet it appears
<PB N="61" REF="64">evident, that our manufactures and manufacturers, who are here to be taken only as con&s;umers thereof, have increa&s;ed with greater celerity: thus the pro|duct of the country is not &s;o great as formerly, in pro|portion to the number of per&s;ons to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is, that a greater con&s;umption of wheat has taken place, by equal numbers of the lower cla&s;s, in the latter period than the former. This may be &s;hown to be in the highe&s;t degree probable, from the prices of the table to the end of the war of 1740. For, from the beginning to the end of that term, which con&s;iderably exceeded half a century, &s;ome advance, and that not incon|&s;iderable, was made in the wages of artizans and labourers in hu&s;bandry. But if, contrary to all te&s;|timony, and the rea&s;on of the thing, we &s;uppo&s;e them to have for that term remained fixed, the effect of this long fall of prices would be the &s;ame in kind, but inferior in degree only.</P>
<P>While the price of the grain reputed the be&s;t for bread, was decrea&s;ing in every period, and the weekly income of the lower cla&s;s, who had before very much &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on &s;ub&s;titutes for it, was en|crea&s;ing, or even remaining fixed; it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that they would de&s;ert the u&s;e of the latter, or at lea&s;t greatly dimini&s;h it, and indulge them&s;elves in that of the former in its &s;tead. At the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t and the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, a mixture of rye or barley with
<PB N="62" REF="65">wheat was very common in the bread of the lower cla&s;s: the former was called ma&s;lin. Houghton, in his collections on trade and hu&s;bandry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. No. 90, April 20, 1694.</NOTE>, informs us, that barley bread was in &s;uch general u&s;e in &s;ome parts of England, that of &s;eventeen quarters of corn ground weekly, at a mill in one pari&s;h in Buckingham&s;hire, &s;ixteen were of barley: and in Wales, that a bread had been long in u&s;e, made of equal weights of wheat meal and of boiled turnips, the juice being pre&s;&s;ed out of them. That bread intirely of wheat was not much eaten by the poor, may be al&s;o inferred, from what he &s;ays of that which was made of wheat meal, with the coar&s;e bran &s;i&s;ted out. "This &s;ort," he informs us, "is chiefly in the country, <HI>among able folk, that do value good bread.</HI>"</P>
<P>But the principal grain u&s;ed in making bread, together with wheat or by it&s;elf was rye. In the year 1688, Mr. King computed the quantity of wheat grown for con&s;umption at fourteen millions of bu&s;hels; and of rye at ten millions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Whitworth's Davenant, Vol. II. p. 216.</NOTE>. Thus taking the con&s;umption to have been as the pro|duct, the wheat was only 593/1000 of the bread corn con&s;umed: but previous to the year 1772, the author of the Political E&s;&s;ays on the Briti&s;h Em|pire, informs us, that the con&s;umption of wheat had been encrea&s;ed to 3,840,000, while that of rye
<PB N="63" REF="66">had been dimini&s;hed to 1,030,000 quarters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 97, 98. Account of Wheat from the three tracts on the Corn Trade: that of Rye probably from the &s;ame writer.</NOTE>: there fore the con&s;umption of wheat was now become 788/1000 of the whole of our bread corn; or the average con&s;umption of wheat per head, was now increa&s;ed in the proportion of 788 to 583; or that of four to three nearly. This circum&s;tance, oined to the relative increa&s;e of our artizans and manufacturers, has chiefly contributed change our export trade of wheat, into an import. The u&s;e of the inferior corns in bread is now confined to a narrow di&s;trict; continually encroached upon and dimini&s;hing, by the borderers falling into the intire u&s;e of wheat.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the labourer in every department, mu&s;t have been extremely ea&s;y in the fir&s;t of the terms, that of the fall of prices, ending in the war of 1740. This brought on an augmentation of their indulgences, in the u&s;e of wheat for rye; which becoming cu&s;tomary in certain parts of the kingdom, now became to be reputed at lea&s;t as a nece&s;&s;ary. This was not the only one of which they contracted &s;uch fixed habits, that it became &s;uch; others might be mentioned. When the price of wheat and other commodities began to ri&s;e greatly, great additions in the poor's rate took place on tho&s;e two accounts jointly (O). This con&s;equence of what has been &s;aid, is of too much general importance to have been pa&s;&s;ed by un|noticed,
<PB N="64" REF="67">but not enough connected with the &s;ubject to dilate any further upon it.</P>
<P>In the latter part of the &s;econd period, as it has been before &s;tated, it had become permanently ne|ce&s;&s;ary to import corn in war and peace. The fir&s;t war in which this nece&s;&s;ity took place was that of 1775: it may be by &s;ome contended, that this nece&s;&s;ity will rai&s;e the war prices above tho&s;e of peace. On this &s;ubject one party will argue thus: <Q>when we carry on an export trade in war, our wheat mu&s;t in the foreign market pay the home prices, freight and mercantile profit, with the ad|dition of in&s;urance again&s;t captures: which la&s;t addition tends to rencer it in war too dear for foreign markets. Thus our &s;uperabundance is kept at home, and the prices fall. But when we carry on an import trade in war, the in&s;urance being added to the import price, the effect of the import to keep down the price of our own pro|duct is dimini&s;hed, and an increa&s;e of them takes place.</Q></P>
<P>This conclu&s;ion holds good only, as to that part of the corn not imported in neutral bottoms, but in our own ve&s;&s;els, &s;ailing without convoy; which was much more frequent in the la&s;t war, than now &s;ince the convoy tax. It al&s;o implies that the na|tions with which we are at war, carry on neither an export or import trade in corn. For in that ca&s;e, there will be corn &s;hips taken on both &s;ides; and
<PB N="65" REF="68">the balance of captures of &s;uch ve&s;&s;els is to be con&s;idered. And being mo&s;t powerful at &s;ea that balance will be in our favour, and counteract the effect of the in&s;urance. But this in&s;urance, and the balance of captures, are only oppo&s;ite articles of account, the &s;pecific amount of which cannot be annexed to either; and con&s;equently it cannot be known which &s;ide exceeds the other. This is capable of being determined only one way, by a compari&s;on of the prices of corn, in wars during which we &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in part by wheat imported; with tho&s;e of the terms of peace preceding and following them, in which the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity took place. Only one &s;uch in&s;tance has occurred: if the ba&s;is of the conclu&s;ion be narrow, it is the wide&s;t on which any can legitimately be founded: and the circum&s;tances of it go as far as po&s;&s;ible, to compen&s;ate for its being a &s;ingle in&s;tance only. In the war of 1775, we were en|gaged again&s;t four powers; and, as far as the cap|ture of corn ve&s;&s;els only is concerned, they were naval powers: for by the knowledge the American &s;ailors po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of our coa&s;ts, their privateers which were were numerous, were in proportion to their numbers more formidable than tho&s;e of any one of our other three enemies: while the royal navy, which gallantly, but with unequal force, &s;upported a difficult defen&s;ive again&s;t the fleets of France, Holland, and Spain, united, could not be applied,
<PB N="66" REF="69">as u&s;ual, to &s;cour the &s;eas of the&s;e little predatory crui&s;ers: a duty which it now performs with &s;o much effect; while the protection it gives to the corn trade, among others, goes &s;o far beyond all former example.</P>
<P>It remains to examine what effect this accumu|lation of adver&s;e circum&s;tances tending to increa&s;e the in&s;urance, and to turn a favourable into an ad|ver&s;e balance of captures of corn &s;hips, produced. The average price of wheat during the peace of 1763, was 2&pound;. 9 <HI>s.</HI> 5 <HI>d.</HI> and of the following war, 2&pound;. 1 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI> per quarter: the price of the pre|ceding peace therefore exceeded that of war, by the very high rate of 17&pound;. 17 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d. per cent.</HI> The con&s;tant importation is here taken to com|mence with the peace; in fact it has continued only for thirty-two years to the pre&s;ent time, for which "we have the undoubted autho|rity of Lord Liverpoole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hod&s;on's Sermon, Appendix, p. 29.</NOTE>." It therefore com|menced with the year 1768, the &s;eventh before the commencement of the war: and the average price of wheat for who&s;e years was 2&pound;. 10 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI> per quarter; exceeding that of the following war by 21&pound;. 9 <HI>s.</HI> 5 <HI>d. per cent.</HI> The nece&s;&s;ity of impor|tation was indicated by the ri&s;e of prices, and it was &s;o demon&s;trated to take place <HI>at fir&s;t,</HI> in the middle of a term of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70">The price of corn after having fallen in the fir&s;t war, during which we were under a nece&s;&s;ity of importing it, to 2&pound;. 1 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI> as above; ro&s;e again in the following peace to 2&pound;. 6 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d.</HI> the average of the term: or 10&pound;. 2 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> &frac12; <HI>per cent.</HI> If therefore a nation is &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in part by corn imported, this example &s;hows that a war, of which every circum|&s;tance &s;eemed to tend to increa&s;e the in&s;urance to the utmo&s;t, did notwith&s;tanding greatly reduce the price.</P>
<P>From what is &s;tated the conclu&s;ion is, that the effect of war is to reduce the price of wheat; and it is probable, by parity of rea&s;on, that of all the prime nece&s;&s;aries of life which are not directly taxed. And that the prices of wheat have exhibited in the time of no war any appearance of being affected by the circuitous effect of any taxes it has brought upon us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our taxes increa&s;ed rapidly in the fir&s;t century after the revolution; the price of wheat fell in the &s;ame manner; this indicates that taxes impo&s;ed in war, have no effect on it in the following peace. (See Note A.)</NOTE>. And it will hardly be alledged that there is any thing in the nature or circum&s;tances of the pre&s;ent war, &s;o far differing from all pre|ceding wars &s;ince the abdication, as to render its effect diametrically oppo&s;ite to all &s;uch, or make it tend to advance prices. The true cau&s;es of the melancholy &s;tate of the market are a deficiency of the product of la&s;t year, (P) joined perhaps to &s;ome others; among which mu&s;t be reckoned that &s;pirit
<PB N="68" REF="71">of &s;peculation, &s;ea&s;ons favourable to its effects never fail to excite. Whether its &s;y&s;tem has not received great improvements, its combinations become more exten&s;ive, and its &s;pirit more keen, are inquiries not purpo&s;ed to be entered upon.</P>
<P>There are a &s;et of per&s;ons, it mu&s;t be here in conclu&s;ion added, who have lately con&s;idered it as matter of no &s;mall criminality, to urge any argu|ments which may be employed afterwards as topics to defend the continuance of war, <HI>in any ca&s;e.</HI> Peace con&s;idered in the ab&s;tract is preferable to war. But if any one &s;hould now, with Era&s;mus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Moriae encomion.</NOTE>, have the temerity to deny this; before it could be &s;hown to be true, it would be nece&s;&s;ary accurately to enu|merate what are the leading con&s;equences of both. No fal&s;ity in that enumeration, can afford a le|gitimate ba&s;is of an argument for this truth: we have the experience of above a century to de|mon&s;trate the gro&s;s error, of reckoning an augmen|tation of the price of corn among the con&s;equences of war; and if we were involved in a war, ever &s;o unju&s;t and unnece&s;&s;ary, it would be betraying a good cau&s;e to argue for its being put an end to, from &s;o fal&s;e a po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Admit now that it were true that war rai&s;es the rates of the corn market, what is that con&s;equence thereof to &s;ociety? a phy&s;ical or natural evil. But
<PB N="69" REF="72">if the war a nation be engaged in be ju&s;t and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> from the nature of nece&s;&s;ity, that evil and the others incident to war would be overbalanced by different evils, but the &s;ame in kind, if we did not exert our &s;trength by war to repel them. It is therefore, even in conjunction with others, in a ju&s;t cau&s;e to be vo|luntarily &s;ubmitted to, as the le&s;s of two evils.</P>
<P>But it is only one cla&s;s of tho&s;e who will cen&s;ure the conclu&s;ion here deduced, to whom this is a reply. Others may &s;ay, that <Q>arguments liable to be perverted into a recommendation of the &s;tate of war, ought not to be urged by the mini&s;ters of our church. That it is of little avail to admit in general terms the criminality of an unju&s;t war, when among its con&s;equences, a fall of the price of wheat is a&s;&s;erted to be one; it being an object which a great cla&s;s of &s;ociety always reckons among its fir&s;t intere&s;ts to &s;ecure.</Q> To this it is replied, that by parity of rea&s;oning, if a moral writer or a preacher, in treating on &s;ome of the greater vices, were to admit that they in a certain &s;hape, and under certain circum&s;tances, promote a man's pre&s;ent intere&s;t, he might be re|proached as favouring the exten&s;ion of tho&s;e vices. If it is here &s;aid that war reduces the price of wheat by a certain number of pence in the pound, or a certain rate <HI>per cent,</HI> the mo&s;t applauded writers have &s;aid much more without reprehen&s;ion.

<P>(B) The prices are tho&s;e of Wind&s;or market. But a very material difference in the title of the tables of Smith and Hod&s;on cannot be pa&s;&s;ed over. It is &s;tated above that the quarter is of eight bu&s;hels: which &s;eems con|firmed by a copy of the &s;ame original account in M. Po&s;tlethwayte's Dictionary, ending with the year 1753. Smith expre&s;sly &s;ays it was of nine bu&s;hels. This was not an error of the pre&s;s, he every where in his computations takes it at nine. The &s;tatement of Mr. H. is adhered to in the text, on a pre&s;ump|tion that it is a ju&s;t but tacit correction of an error which had crept into Dr. Smith's work, which was di&s;covered by the author of the Corn tracts. But the evidence of this is not &s;o complete as to preclude all regard to the autho|rity of &s;o celebrated a writer. As further evidence, to decide which is right, is not attainable by me, in the notes every computation is repeated, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that all the prices of the table, to the year 1765 inclu&s;ive,
<PB N="75" REF="77">are of quarters of nine bu&s;hels; which therefore require to be reduced to eight the legal quarter by the deduc|tion of one ninth of their amount. It is proper to add to this notice, that the conclu&s;ion derived from both the tables (for the variation in the title makes them effectively two) with re&s;pect to the effect of war on the price of corn is the &s;ame, that its tendency is to reduce it: although the mea&s;ures of the effect deduced by each nece&s;&s;arily differ; that re&s;ulting from Dr. A.

<P><HI>(F)On the mode of finding the price of corn for any required year, having the correct prices of two given between which it &s;omewhere falls. Al&s;o if three &s;uch yearly prices be given, to determine that of any intermediate year, between the fir&s;t and la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The rates of the wheat market on certain years, are more correctly given by averages formed from tho&s;e of an equal number of years before and after, than by the ab&s;o|lute price of the year; which is &s;ubject to an irregular and con&s;iderable ri&s;e or fall from accidents. But the principles on which the prices of other years are found lying between tho&s;e of which the correcter rates are given, require &s;ome explanation; as perhaps no political arithmetician has applied them but Mr. Gregory King; and he concealed his proce&s;s, giving only re&s;ults: the mo&s;t &s;imple ca&s;e of its application is to be begun with: of it&s;elf it &s;eems plain enough to have been left without
<PB N="78" REF="80">any explanation: it is therefore only given here, as opening the way to that of the &s;econd, which is &s;omewhat more complicated.</P>
<P>Having two correct prices of a commodity given; one for an a&s;&s;igned year, and the other taking place at a cer|tain number of years after it; if they be equal, the mar|ket is to be taken not to have varied in the whole term: if the &s;econd exceed the fir&s;t, the rates are to be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been augmented equally in equal times, if no cau&s;e appear to indicate otherwi&s;e; or their annual aug|ments to have been equal; whereby the rate of any in|termediate year will be a&s;&s;igned with the greate&s;t pro|bability. For both the given prices being taken from averages of &s;ufficient length, the increa&s;e of the latter indicates the operation of a permanent cau&s;e; which is to be taken to operate equally or produce equal effects in all equal times of the whole period, if there exi&s;t no adequate indication to the contrary: becau&s;e when an a&s;&s;umption is to be made, it ought to be the mo&s;t &s;imple that can be &s;ound to agree with the nature of the &s;ubject; to which de&s;cription this conforms. And the &s;ame thing which is true of augments in this ca&s;e, is true al&s;o of decrements in the conver&s;e; or when the fir&s;t given rate is greate&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus it the price of wheat at the beginning of a term of twenty-&s;even years be 523.84 <HI>d.</HI> per quarter (which is the mo&s;t commodious way in &s;uch in&s;tances of denoting its value, and at the end of the term it fall to 440.41 <HI>d.</HI>; the decrea&s;e at the end of the twenty-&s;eventh year will be 83.4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>d.</HI> and its con&s;tant annual decrement be 3.09 <HI>d.</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nce its price at the end of any year may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound; as f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r in&s;tance the tenth.

<P>Here the annual augments or decrements are taken equal, nothing indicating the contrary. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is now to be &s;hown how tho&s;e indications are to be followed, when di&s;covered. Suppo&s;e, be&s;ide the prices at the beginning and end of a term of time, given as before, at &s;ome in|termediate in&s;tant thereof, there be a third price given; if this be equal to what would be found from the two ex|tremes, by the former proce&s;s, there is no indication that the annual augments are not equal; but the contrary: but if it be either greater or le&s;s, it indicates that they are une|qual; and that they are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively increa&s;ed or decrea&s;ed. as the ca&s;e may be. And the &s;ame rea&s;ons which proved, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive augments ought to be taken equal in the fir&s;t ca&s;e; &s;hew al&s;o, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive differences of the augments ought to be taken equal in the &s;econd. When therefore two prices, and a &s;ingle interval of time only are given, the price in any intermediately time is to be found, by &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive augments equal; as in the fir&s;t ca&s;e: but when three prices and two inter|vals are given, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive augments then vary, but their differences are now perpetually to be &s;uppo&s;ed equal, as tho&s;e of the prices them&s;elves had been made in the former ca&s;e. For arguing as before, the mo&s;t &s;imple a&s;&s;umption is to be made, that will bring out a re&s;ult agreeing in every in&s;tance with what is given, or the nature of the &s;ubject as far as known. The mode of a&s;&s;igning the price at any given point of time, in the two intervals, and of pre&s;erving the condition de&s;cribed, is delivered in the lemma referred to in the text. When the fir&s;t calculation upon it is given, it &s;hall be proved by an arithmetical illu&s;tration, that this condition is ob|&s;erved;
<PB N="80" REF="82">although it will not be repeated in the &s;ub&s;equent applications of it.</P>
<P>As the u&s;e of this mode of proceeding has been long intermitted by political arithmeticians, here &s;hall be given &s;ome further account of it: which may be of u&s;e, not in|deed even to moderate proficients in a particular &s;cience, but to many others. When a &s;eries of prices of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive years are given, the augments are their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive differences, and are called fir&s;t differences; and when the latter are equal, or have no difference, the &s;econd differences of the prices are nothing; and when the differences of the augments are equal, the&s;e being what are called the &s;econd differences of the prices, they are equal al&s;o: but now, the third differences are nothing.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t differences are equal, any term of the &s;eries of prices is to be found by the &s;imple&s;t ca&s;e of the method of differentials. When their &s;econd differences are equal; it falls under the &s;econd; the next approach|ing to the preceding in &s;implicity, and the facility of proceeding by it. The operation by which the price for any required year is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> found, is called an interpolation; and after &s;peaking of the application of this method to the purpo&s;es for which it was originally invented, Stir|ling thus de&s;cribes the further exten&s;ion of its u&s;e. <Q>After this mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, many things that are difficult to ob&s;erve at a certain time, may be determined accu|rately enough from certain ob&s;ervations taken before and after that time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ff.

<P>But the application of this mode will be condemned as a u&s;ele&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary refinement; as an intricate de|duction of re&s;ults, which might be obtained in a plainer manner.

<P>The equation of prices is of the &s;econd power.

<P>It mu&s;t therefore be now &s;hown, that in each ca&s;e the celerity of the fall is the &s;ame.

<P>(K) The compari&s;on in the text would &s;tand thus ac|cording to Dr. A. Smith.

<P>The amount and proportion of the annual oppo&s;ite variations, are thus found from Smith's table. The price of the quarter of wheat at the end of 1692 was 2 &pound;. 5 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> in forty-&s;even years and a half it fell to 1 &pound;. 11 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d.</HI> or 13 <HI>s.</HI> 11 <HI>d.</HI> nearly.

<P>From the year 1740 to the pre&s;ent time, the operation of a permanent cau&s;e augmented the rates of the market: its mea&s;ure is different according to Hodg&s;on and to Smith; and greater by the latter. By both it appears to
<PB N="89" REF="91">have operated in war as well as peace, but with mo&s;t effect in peace: therefore the main que&s;tion whether war tends to increa&s;e or depre&s;s the price of wheat, is not at all implicated in this difference of the two tables.

<P>(L) The &s;ums entered in the columns of duties are the &s;eignorage of the metal, or coinage duties only; and their title is too comprehen&s;ive. For in the fir&s;t period of &s;ixty-five years, when the metals paid the double tax or one fifth to the king, with the coinage duty of one and a half <HI>per cent.,</HI> and in the latter of forty-nine years, when it was &s;ingle, with the &s;ame addition; the only duties charged in the table are one and a half <HI>per cent.</HI> nearly upon the product: which is thus &s;hown in the mo&s;t im|portant article, the &s;ilver. In the fir&s;t &s;ixty-five years, while the king's greater duty was one fifth nearly, the quantity of &s;ilver on which it was paid was 6, 222, 297 marks. The mark was at various rates, in different pe|riods, but the mo&s;t permanent was eight dollars, five rials, and thirty mervadies; taken al&s;o as its con&s;tant value in the text. That &s;um therefore amounted to 429, 840, 267 rials; and the tax the table &s;tates to have been received
<PB N="90" REF="92">on this &s;um, was 6,360,638 rials. Here neglecting all places of figures after the fifth, the tax of which an ac|count is given, appears to have been (1.4797) one and a half <HI>per cent.</HI> Likewi&s;e in the &s;econd term, after the great duty was reduced to a tenth of the &s;ilver nearly, the product in forty-nine years was 15, 471,791 marks, or 1068,801,289 rials; and the duty charged 16,389,006 rials, being at the rate of (1, 5334) one and a half <HI>per cent.</HI> The greater tax, reduced from one fifth to one tenth, is therefore not noticed in the table.</P>
<P>The mean of the two rates 1.4797 and 1.5334 is 1.5060 <HI>per cent.</HI> or one and a half <HI>per cent.</HI> very nearly: the rea&s;on that the re&s;ult is not exactly at that rate in each period, is, that the value of a mark, e&s;timated in dollars, rials, and merva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s, varied in particular terms. The allowance to be made for tho&s;e variations is not worth &s;earching after.</P>
<P>As the &s;ums in the columns of duties, bear a fixed proportion to the value of the products; nothing can be di&s;covered from the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rmer, but what is deducible al&s;o from the latter: no u&s;e therefore is made of them&mdash;it was nece&s;&s;ary however to give an account why they are pa&s;&s;ed over.</P>

<P>In the year 1775, and the three following, duties were paid on 330, 912 gold ca&s;tellans: during the fir&s;t two years and three quarters, at the old or higher, and the la&s;t five quarters, at the reduced rates: the product of the two terms is not di&s;tingui&s;hed, the &s;um of both only is given. But from the annual average of the preceding
<PB N="91" REF="93">twenty years, the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;ums may be determined with con&s;iderable probability. The total of the whole term was 816, 158, and the yearly average 40, 807 ca&s;tellans: in the term of two years and three quarters, duties were therefore paid on 112, 217; and in the la&s;t five quarters after the reduction of the tax on 218, 695; or on 174, 956 ca&s;tellans in one year: which exceeds the average of twenty years, 40, 807, in the proportion of 428.72 to 100. If the average of thirty years be taken, the re&s;ult is very nearly the &s;ame. But if ten years further back had been admitted into it, the proce&s;s would have become vitiated, For that term of ten years commenced in 1735; and the table here followed indicates, that in the fir&s;t five years of the term a new gold mine or mines were di&s;|covered, of &s;uch fertility, as that &s;uddenly the taxed total product, was much more than trebled; and in the &s;econd equal time more than doubled: but in the following five years, this new &s;ource appears to have been nearly ex|hau&s;ted.</P>
<P>The effect of this anomalous increa&s;e is &s;uch, that divided in the average of forty-nine years, it rai&s;ed it nearly in the proportion of &s;ix to four. That average is given in the text, 61, 344 ca&s;tellans a year: if it &s;hall be contended that it ought to be made the ba&s;is of computa|tion, the product of a year after the la&s;t reduction, will appear to be 129, 772 ca&s;tellans, or the double thereof only: but this &s;uppo&s;es two augments of the average of the la&s;t twenty years to have taken place, in the five quarters the reduction of the tax had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted: the fir&s;t the effect of that mea&s;ure, doubling the quantity of the gold paying duty; and the &s;econd, accidental di&s;coveries or increa&s;e of the product of the old mines, which at the &s;ame
<PB N="92" REF="94">time increa&s;ed that amount about fifty <HI>per cent.</HI> a circum|&s;tance not to be gratuitou&s;ly admitted.</P>
<P>It is certain however that the ba&s;is on which the &s;pe|cifie proportion a&s;&s;igned &s;tands, is &s;o narrow, that if ever an average re&s;ult of the mea&s;ure on an adequate term of time can be obtained, it mu&s;t probably be found to vary con&s;iderably from it. Whether the variation will &s;how an exce&s;s or deficiency in the former, cannot be on any firm ground conjectured; but the evidence from what is known, is &s;ufficient proof that the quantity of gold from the&s;e mines, imported into Europe, mu&s;t be greatly in|crea&s;ed by this reduction of duties; although the de&s;inite proportion of the increa&s;e cannot be fixed.</P>
<P>A like but inferior increa&s;e is in the &s;ame manner found to have taken place, in the product of &s;ilver at that time. Its average for the twenty years preceding 1775, had been 297, 817 marks; which by the reduction of the tax, ap|pears to have been augmented to 1, 043, 032 marks; or in the ratio of 350.22 to 100.</P>

<P>(O) A near approach may be made to the determination of the rate of advance <HI>per cent.</HI> by which the change of the proportion of the con&s;umption of wheat in bread to that of rye and barley, has increa&s;ed the charge of the main|tenance of labourers in that article, in the following manner.</P>
<P>Let the total product of wheat and rye in 1688, be fir&s;t taken to have been con&s;umed as food for man: and as the barley &s;o u&s;ed was at the &s;ame time con&s;i|derable, let it be admitted to have been one fourth the quantity of the latter. The con&s;umption of wheat, rye and barley was of 14, 10<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King, See Davenant, v. 2. p. 217.</NOTE>, and 2 &frac12; millions of bu&s;hels re&s;pectively; and the total twenty-&s;ix millions and a half.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96">But the u&s;e of the inferior kinds of grain was not, at that period, intirely confined to the cla&s;s of people labouring for hire: a con&s;iderable quantity was al&s;o con|&s;umed, by the lower orders of tho&s;e whom Mr. King enumerates in the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of his table of cla&s;&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King. See Davenant, v. 2. p. 184, table.</NOTE>, who&s;e intire income to &s;upport their families; did not amount to 50 &pound;. yearly; although they u&s;ed wheaten bread in a much greater proportion than the labourers. Let it be therefore admitted that two thirds of their con|&s;umption was intirely of wheat; and the remaining third, of bread of the &s;everal &s;pecies of corn, mixed in the &s;ame proportion as that eaten by the lower cla&s;s: or, which amounts to the &s;ame thing, that two thirds of tho&s;e who fell under this de&s;cription, con&s;umed no other grain but wheat; and the remaining third the &s;ame bread as the labourers. The&s;e individuals form three orders in Mr. King's table: a third of the number comprehended in the whole of which is 405, 000. Therefore in a po|pulation of five millions and a half, the number &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing upon wheat entirely was 2, 270, 520 per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Now wheat is more nutritious than either of the in|ferior grains; but this richer cla&s;s are le&s;s par&s;imonious in their con&s;umption than the lower; and the one cir|cum&s;tance &s;hall be taken to balance the other. Where|fore the quantity of bread corn u&s;ed by them was as the numbers of each. Now our whole population at the time Mr. King wrote, having been five millions and a half; and our con&s;umption having been twenty-&s;ix mil|lions and a half of bu&s;hels of bread corn; that of 2, 270, 520 per&s;ons, was 10, 939, 000 bu&s;hels very nearly: and this being intirely of wheat, there remained for
<PB N="95" REF="97">the 3,229,480 per&s;ons who eat the inferior bread; of wheat 3,061,000 bu&s;hels; of rye 10,000,000; and of barley 2,500,000; the total of which is 15,561,000 bu&s;hels.</P>
<P>The bu&s;hel of wheat <HI>"was worth three &s;hillings and &s;ixpence upon the &s;pot where it grew,"</HI> at that time: <Q>but this value was increa&s;ed by carriage to the place where it was la&s;t &s;pent at lea&s;t one-fourth more<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King in Davenant, v. ii, p. 217.</NOTE></Q> The former, although the mode of expre&s;&s;ion is &s;ingular, was the value of the corn &s;tanding on the ground. The ad|dition is the aggregate of the in&s;urance again&s;t the hazard of weather in getting it into the barn, the charges of harve&s;t, of thre&s;hing and carriage to market. The average market price of wheat was therefore 4 <HI>s.</HI> 4&frac12; <HI>d.</HI> the bu&s;hel.

It was nece&s;&s;ary to go into the&s;e parti|culars; for Dr. A. Smith has &s;uppo&s;ed the former rates to have been what he calls contract prices; or the rates at which the farmer will &s;ell his wheat to the merchant at home. He &s;uppo&s;es him therefore to abate 20&pound;. <HI>per cent,</HI> "to avoid the trouble and expence of marketing<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. i. p. 307.</NOTE>:" his defence of this is by a &s;econd error: he &s;hows this rate to be higher than that of the particular year 1687; but the table he gives, proves that year to have fallen below the average of the ten years which it fini&s;hes, in the great proportion of five to eight and a half<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 404.</NOTE>: and &s;till more below that of the eight years preceding tho&s;e ten.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="98">But in the year 1772, barley had grown into total di&s;u&s;e as food for man. The author of the political e&s;&s;ays quoted above &s;peaks of it as that of animals only<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 100.</NOTE>. The proportion of wheat then rai&s;ed, to that of rye, was con&s;iderably increa&s;ed; and had become as 384 to 103. A proportion which al&s;o would have obtained in 1688, if the &s;uperior kind of corn, wheat, had been as commonly con&s;umed then, as at that &s;ub&s;equent period; as the pro|duction of both would have been as the demand for each. Therefore, of the 26&frac12; millions of bu&s;hels required to feed the whole people, 5, 604, 700 only would have been of rye; and the remainder wheat; the demand for barley as human food cea&s;ing intirely. And the con&s;umption of the eaters of inferior bread 15, 561, 000 bu&s;hels would have exhau&s;ted the whole of the rye 5, 604, 700, together with 9, 956, 300 bu&s;hels of wheat: the value of which, at the rates given above, is 3, 053, 673&pound;. Whence by decrea&s;ing the proportion of the inferior grains in their food, the charge of &s;upplying this number of per&s;ons with bread-corn, was increa&s;ed in the proportion of 3, 053, 673&pound;. to 2, 544, 593&pound;.; or (20.007) 20&pound;. <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>This augment had taken place in eighty-four years; and there has &s;ince elap&s;ed twenty-eight, in which &s;ome further increa&s;e of its amount has taken place. It un|doubtedly advanced with the greate&s;t celerity in the fir&s;t period: and if that fir&s;t celerity may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in mea&s;ure the double of the latter, the advance in the la&s;t twenty-eight years, will be equal to that of fourteen of the former term; or one-&s;ixth of its whole amount. Therefore e&s;timated in this mode, the effect of the
<PB N="97" REF="99">change of food, has rai&s;ed the charge of the bread-corn con&s;umed by this body of men, 23&pound;. 6 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d. per cent.</HI></P>
<P>If any proportional part of the product of wheat and rye, as a twentieth or twenty-fifth of each, were em|ployed for any other u&s;e than food for man at both periods; the &s;ame rate of advance of the charge per head would have been found. Any variation from this would have made a proportional variation in the re&s;ult, but it was probably &s;o little that its effect may very well be ne|glected: yet &s;ome greater proportion of wheat, than of rye, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been applied to &s;uch other u&s;es. Therefore fir&s;t let the quantity of the inferior grains u&s;ed in food, be &s;uppo&s;ed to continue fixed; and the wheat alone &s;o con&s;umed to have been dimini&s;hed: the total con&s;umption of the three &s;pecies will have been dimini&s;hed by the &s;ame quantity; together with the &s;hare of the lower cla&s;s, in proportion of its numbers to the whole population. This &s;hare being therefore le&s;s, and its con&s;umption of the two inferior grains the &s;ame, its proportional part of their whole expenditure was le&s;s: therefore the rate <HI>per cent.</HI> of the increa&s;e of the charge, from the change from the former to the pre&s;ent propor|tion, was greater.</P>
<P>And if the two products be dimini&s;hed in two different proportions, the wheat will have been dimini&s;hed in the greater: the con&s;equence whereof will be the &s;ame as if the inferior corn eaten, had remained undimini&s;hed; but the wheat had been decrea&s;ed by the difference of the two ratios alone; the increa&s;e of the charge in this &s;econd ca&s;e would have been greater al&s;o.</P>
<P>If the number of per&s;ons &s;o fed be reduced or increa&s;ed one half, or in any other proportion, the ab&s;olute charge of the fir&s;t or &s;econd mode of providing bread-corn for
<PB N="98" REF="100">them, would be reduced or increa&s;ed in the &s;ame propor|tion: but &s;till that of the &s;econd would exceed the fir&s;t, by the &s;ame rate <HI>per cent:</HI> which rate is al&s;o the mea&s;ure of the increa&s;e of charge for an individual, or any equal number of individuals, as far as it ari&s;es from the difference of the proportions of the &s;pecies of corn con&s;umed only.</P>
<P>The prices of wheat, rye, and barley, as taken from Mr. King, are re&s;pectively as 7, 5, and 4: and in what|ever manner the prices &s;hall vary, &s;till pre&s;erving the &s;ame proportions to each other, &s;o that each &s;hall become one half or one third of tho&s;e given by him, or in any other ratio more or le&s;s; the advance of the charge <HI>per cent.</HI> will be found the &s;ame. The three la&s;t conclu&s;ions follow from the nature of proportionals.</P>
<P>But the ratio of the prices of the three grains, a&s;&s;igned by him in 1688, &s;eems to hold to this day. This ap|pears from the two following extracts from Mr. Cather|wood's regi&s;ter, which are the only ones I can now give.</P>

<P>(P) From the accounts of Mr. Glover, pro-in&s;pector general of exports and imports, pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e of Lords July 10th la&s;t, of foreign wheat imported into the port of London, in the la&s;t nineteen years and a half; an evident proof is derived of the reality of a great failure of crops in the la&s;t &s;even years and a half.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t twelve years contained in this account, be|ginning with 1781, there were imported into the port of London 510, 123 quarters of foreign wheat; and on the average 42, 510 annually: during the la&s;t &s;even years and a half, the total import was 1, 676, 289; or 223, 505 quarters yearly. But the import of the year 1794, in the copy of the account here followed, being only 19, 654 quarters, is certainly erroneou&s;ly given<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. James's Evening Po&s;t, July 12, 1800. The import of London is nearly two-thards of that of the kingdom: the latter in this year was 324, 637: there is therefore a figure omitted in the printing.</NOTE> As therefore we are &s;earching for the mea&s;ure of the deficiences of certain years of &s;carcity, it is to be left out of the average, determining its mean degree: whence the import of 6&frac12; years of the pre&s;ent war correctly known, appears to have amounted to 254, 866 quarters; which is to the import in ordinary years, as 599&frac12; to 100; or 6 to unity.</P>
<P><HI>But the mean deficiency of the crop during the pre&s;ent war, has exceeded that of the preceding peace, in a ratio con&s;iderably exceeding that of &s;ix to one.</HI> Becau&s;e the high prices con|&s;iderably
<PB N="100" REF="102">dimini&s;hed the total con&s;umption; and the de|ficiency was equal the &s;um of the import, and the de|crement of con&s;umption jointly.</P>
<P>It does not however appear, that there was a pro|gre&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of the imports during this period of nineteen years and a half. Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t and la&s;t terms four years of the fir&s;t twelve, were the greate&s;t: and of the&s;e two, the former much exceeded the latter; and at lea&s;t they mu&s;t be taken as &s;tationary. In the year 1793, the import ro&s;e <HI>per &s;altum;</HI> pointing out a failure of production from natural cau&s;es. That of the year 1796, it &s;hould &s;eem, will exceed what that of the pre&s;ent year will ultimately be found to amount to; and perhaps in the proportion of 477 to 442, very nearly.</P>
<P>In 1795 there were imported into the kingdom, 287, 930 quarters of foreign wheat; and into the port of London 198, 911; and the exce&s;s of the former above the latter, was in the proportion of 144&frac34; to 100. In the following year, 1796, which was a year of great &s;carcity, the total import of the kingdom was 814, 265, and of London 477, 877 quarters; and the proportion of the fir&s;t to the &s;econd import is that of 170&frac13; to 100: ratios not &s;o differing from each other, as that either &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed very remote from that which generally obtains: the total import may therefore be taken, with con&s;iderable probability, to that of Lon|don, as 157 (or more nearly 157.57) to 100. The an|nual average import of the port of London having been 254, 866 quarters, as above; that of England appears to have been 401,570.</P>
<P>This proportion &s;eems for general purpo&s;es accurate enough; although its intire coincidence with the fact is
<PB N="101" REF="103">accidental. After the above computation was fini&s;hed, I found that Lord Liverpool<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See account of his &s;peech on the Flour Company Bill, July 21.&mdash; St. James's Chronicle.</NOTE> had averaged the importation of wheat, for the la&s;t five years, at 400, 000 quarters.</P>

<P>It is &s;aid in note F, that Mr. King had applied the method of differentials, of which &s;ome u&s;e has been made above, to political arithmetic. Of the&s;e applica|tions the mo&s;t curious is, the determination of the price <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f corn from the rate of deficiency of the harve&s;t given: his equation for this purpo&s;e &s;hall be here added, with an example of the u&s;e of it, in the &s;olution of the follow|ing que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>The average price of wheat in the la&s;t peace being given, and the current e&s;timate of the defalcation of the crop of la&s;t year in this part of the country, being admitted to be true for the whole kingdom; that it effectively fell &s;hort one third of its ordinary quantity; required the average price of corn of the year, being a year of war?</HI></P>
<P>By the fir&s;t table, the price of wheat per quarter in the la&s;t peace was 554 <HI>d.</HI>; the product of the year being of the average quantity: which by Section V, p. 23, exceeded the price of a like year of the following war, by 9 &pound;. 19 <HI>s.</HI> 2 <HI>d. per cent.</HI> If therefore the product of the la&s;t year had been of the mean quantity, the price of wheat would have been 505&frac12; <HI>d.</HI> the quarter. Which &s;um, according to Mr. King, is to be taken as 10; and the re|quired price as P. And again that product al&s;o being taken as 10, the deficiency having been one third thereof, take D=3.333: and it &s;hall be univer&s;ally P=10 &plus;
<PB N="102" REF="104">2&frac13;D &plus; &frac12;D^2 &plus; &frac16;D^3. Which is the equation from which he calculated the table of advance of prices corre&s;pond|ing to "Detects" given by Davenant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whit. Davenant, v. 2, p. 225.</NOTE>. Here putting D &equals;3&frac12; as above, we have P &equals;29.504. Therefore the price of wheat in ordinary &s;ea&s;ons being as 10, in years of &s;uch deficiency will be as 29.504: moreover as 10 to 42 <HI>s.</HI> 1&frac12; <HI>d.</HI>; &s;o is 29.504, to 124 <HI>s.</HI> 7 <HI>d.</HI>; the average price of wheat per quarter, corre&s;ponding to the crop of the la&s;t year.</P>
<P>I had on a former occa&s;ion noted, that Mr. King un|doubtedly obtained this equation, from the prices of malt for four different years or &s;ets of years, when different prices took place; the amount of the Malt tax giving him the quantity made in each term.</P>
