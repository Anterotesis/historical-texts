<P>THERE are &s;o many young men of fortune and &s;pirit in this kingdom, who, without the trouble of re&s;orting to the founder of their philo&s;ophy, or giving them&s;elves any concern about the <HI>Graius homo</HI> in my motto, have never|thele&s;s fallen upon a practice &s;o con&s;entaneous to the doctrines, which he laid down by &s;y&s;tem, that

I much que&s;tion if any of his profe&s;t &s;cholars ever did him greater credit, &s;ince the time he fir&s;t &s;truck out the popular project of driving all reli|gion out of the world, and introducing plea&s;ure and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s in its &s;tead.</P>

<P>So far from meaning to oppo&s;e my&s;elf to &s;uch a ho&s;t of gay and happy mortals, I wi&s;h to gain a merit with them by adding to their &s;tock of plea&s;ures, and &s;ugge&s;ting &s;ome hints of enjoy|ments, which may be new to them; a di&s;covery which they well know was con&s;idered by the kings of Per&s;ia, (who practi&s;ed their philo&s;ophy in very antient times) as a &s;ervice of &s;uch im|portance to all the &s;ect, (who had even then worn out mo&s;t of their old plea&s;ures) that a very con&s;iderable reward was offered to the inventor of any new one. How the &s;tock at pre&s;ent &s;tands with our modern voluptuaries I cannot pretend to &s;ay but I &s;u&s;pect from certain &s;ymp|toms, which have fallen under my ob&s;ervation, that it is nearly run out with &s;ome among&s;t them; to &s;uch in particular I flatter my&s;elf my di&s;coveries will prove of value, and I have for

their u&s;e compo&s;ed the following meditation, which I have put together in the form of a &s;oli|loquy, &s;olving it &s;tep by &s;tep as regularly as any propo&s;ition in Euclid, and I will boldly vouch it to be as mathematically true. If there is any one <HI>po&s;tulatum</HI> in the whole, which the true&s;t voluptuary will not admit to be orthodox Epi|curi&s;m, I will con&s;ent to give up my &s;y&s;tem for non&s;en&s;e and my&s;elf for an impo&s;tor; I condition only with the pupil of plea&s;ure, that whil&s;t he reads he will reflect, that he will deal candidly with the truth, and that he will once in his life permit a certain faculty called rea&s;on, which I hope he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, to come into u&s;e upon this occa&s;ion; a faculty, which, though he may not hitherto have employed it, is yet capable of &s;upplying him with more true and la&s;ting plea|&s;ures, than any his philo&s;ophy can furni&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>THE VOLUPTUARY'S SOLILOQUY.</HEAD>
<P>I FIND my&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an e&s;tate, which has devolved upon me without any pains of my own: I have youth and health to enjoy it, and I am determined &s;o to do: Plea&s;ure is my object, and I mu&s;t therefore &s;o contrive as to make that object la&s;ting and
<PB N="4" REF="11">
&s;atisfactory: If I throw the means away, I can no longer compa&s;s the end; this is &s;elf-evident; I perceive therefore that I mu&s;t not game; for though I like play, I do not like to lo&s;e that, which alone can purcha&s;e every plea&s;ure I propo&s;e to enjoy; and I do not &s;ee that the chance of winning other people's money can compen&s;ate for the pain I mu&s;t &s;uffer if I lo&s;e my own: An addition to my fortune can only give &s;uperfluities; the lo&s;s of it may take away even nece&s;&s;aries; and in the mean time I have enough for every other gra|tification but the de&s;perate one of deep play: It is re&s;olved therefore that I will not be a game&s;ter: There is not common &s;en&s;e in the thought, and therefore I renounce it.</P>
<P>But if I give up gaming, I will take my &s;wing of plea&s;ure; that I am determined upon. I mu&s;t therefore a&s;k my&s;elf the que&s;tion, what is plea&s;ure? Is it high living and hard drink|ing? I have my own choice to make, there|fore I mu&s;t take &s;ome time to con&s;ider of it. There is nothing very elegant in it I mu&s;t confe&s;s; a glutton is but a &s;orry fellow, and a drunkard is a bea&s;t: Be&s;ides I am not &s;ure my con&s;titution can &s;tand again&s;t it: I &s;hall get the gout, that would be the devil; I &s;hall grow out of all &s;hape; I &s;hall have a red face full of
<PB N="5" REF="12">
blotches, a foul breath and be loath&s;ome to the women: I cannot bear to think of that, for I doat upon the women, and therefore adieu to the bottle and all its concomitants; I prefer the favours of the fair &s;ex to the company of the &s;oakers, and &s;o there is an end to all drinking; I will be &s;ober, only becau&s;e I love plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But if I give up wine for women, I will re|pay my&s;elf for the &s;acrifice; I will have the fine&s;t girls that money can purcha&s;e&mdash;Money, did I &s;ay? What a &s;ound has that!&mdash;Am I to buy beauty with money, and cannot I buy love too? for there is no plea&s;ure even in beauty without love. I find my&s;elf gravelled by this unlucky que&s;tion: Mercenary love! that is non&s;en&s;e; it is flat hypocri&s;y; it is di&s;|gu&s;ting. I &s;hould loath the fawning care&s;&s;es of a di&s;&s;embling harlot, whom I pay for fal&s;e fondne&s;s: I find I am wrong again: I cannot fall in love with a harlot; &s;he mu&s;t be a mode&s;t woman; and when that befals me, what then? Why then, if I am terribly in love indeed, and cannot be happy without her, there is no other choice left me; I think I mu&s;t even marry her! nay I am &s;ure I mu&s;t; for if plea|&s;ure leads that way, plea&s;ure is my object, and marriage is my lot: I am determined therefore to marry, only becau&s;e I love plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="13">
Well! now that I have given up all other women for a wife, I am re&s;olved to take plea&s;ure enough in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her; I mu&s;t be cau|tious therefore that nobody el&s;e takes the &s;ame plea&s;ure too; for otherwi&s;e how have I bettered my&s;elf? I might as well have remained upon the common. I &s;hould be a fool indeed to pay &s;uch a price for a purcha&s;e, and let in my neighbours for a &s;hare; therefore I am deter|mined to keep her to my&s;elf, for plea&s;ure is my only object, and this I take it is a &s;ort of plea|&s;ure, that does not con&s;i&s;t in participation.</P>
<P>The next que&s;tion is, how I mu&s;t contrive to keep her to my&s;elf.&mdash;Not by force; not by locking her up; there is no plea&s;ure in that notion; compul&s;ion is out of the ca&s;e; in|clination therefore is the next thing; I mu&s;t make it her own choice to be faithful: It &s;eems then to be incumbent upon me to make a wi&s;e choice, to look well before I fix upon a wife, and to u&s;e her well, when I have fixed; I will be very kind to her, becau&s;e I will not de&s;troy my own plea&s;ure; and I will be very careful of the temptations I expo&s;e her to, for the &s;ame rea&s;on. She &s;hall not lead the life of your fine town ladies; I have a charm|ing place in the country; I will pa&s;s mo&s;t of my time in the country; there &s;he will be &s;afe
<PB N="7" REF="14">
and I &s;hall be happy. I love plea&s;ure, and therefore I will have little to do with that cur&s;t intriguing town of London; I am deter|mined to make my hou&s;e in the country as plea&s;ant as it is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But if I give up the gaieties of a town life, and the club, and the gaming-table, and the girls, for a wife and the country, I will have the &s;ports of the country in perfection; I will keep the be&s;t pack of hounds in England, and hunt every day in the week.&mdash;But hold a mo|ment there! what will become of my wife all the while I am following the hounds? Will &s;he follow nobody; will nobody follow her? A pretty figure I &s;hall make, to be chacing a &s;tag and come home with the horns. At lea&s;t I &s;hall not ri&s;que the experiment; I &s;hall not like to leave her at home, and I cannot take her with me, for that would &s;poil my plea&s;ure; and I hate a hor&s;e-dog woman; I will keep no whipper-in in petticoats. I perceive there|fore I mu&s;t give up the hounds, for I am de|termined nothing &s;hall &s;tand in the way of my plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Why then I mu&s;t find out &s;ome amu&s;e|ments that my wife can partake in; we mu&s;t ride about the park in fine weather; we mu&s;t vi&s;it the grounds, and the gardens, and plan
<PB N="8" REF="15">
out improvements, and make plantations; it will be rare employment for the poor people&mdash;That is a thought that never &s;truck me before; methinks there mu&s;t be a great deal of plea&s;ure in &s;etting the poor to work&mdash;I &s;hall like a farm for the &s;ame rea&s;on; and my wife will take plea&s;ure in a dairy; &s;he &s;hall have the mo&s;t elegant dairy in England; and I will build a con&s;ervatory, and &s;he &s;hall have &s;uch plants and &s;uch flowers!&mdash;I have a notion I &s;hall take plea&s;ure in them my&s;elf&mdash;And then there is a thou&s;and things to do within-doors; it is a fine old man&s;ion that is the truth of it: I will give it an entire repair; it wants new furniture; that will be very plea&s;ant work for my wife: I perceive I could not afford to keep hounds and do this into the bargain. But this will give me the mo&s;t plea&s;ure all to nothing, and then my wife will partake of it&mdash;And we will have mu&s;ic and books&mdash;I re|collect that I have got an excellent library&mdash;There is another plea&s;ure I had never thought of&mdash;And then no doubt we &s;hall have children, and they are very plea&s;ant company, when they can talk and under&s;tand what is &s;aid to them; and now I begin to reflect, I find there is a va&s;t many plea&s;ures in the life I have chalked out, and what a fool &s;hould I be to throw
<PB N="9" REF="16">
away my money at the gaming-table, or my health at any table, or my affections upon har|lots, or my time upon hounds and hor&s;es, or employ either money, health, affections, or time, in any other plea&s;ures or pur&s;uits, than the&s;e, which I now perceive will lead me to &s;olid happine&s;s in this life, and &s;ecure a good chance for what may befal me hereafter!</P>

<P>GEMINUS and Gemellus were twin-&s;ons of a country gentleman of fortune, whom I &s;hall call Euphorion; when they were of age to begin their grammar learning, Euphorion found him&s;elf exceedingly puzzled to decide upon the be&s;t mode of education; he had read &s;everal treati&s;es on the &s;ubject, which in&s;tead of clearing up his difficulties had encrea&s;ed them;
<PB N="10" REF="17">
he had con&s;ulted the opinions of his friends and neighbours, and he found the&s;e &s;o equally divided, and &s;o much to be &s;aid on both &s;ides, that he could determine upon neither; unfortunately for Euphorion he had no partialities of his own, for the good gentleman had had little or no educa|tion him&s;elf: The clergyman of the pari&s;h preached up the moral advantages of private tuition, the lawyer, his near neighbour, dazzled his imagination with the connections and know|ledge of the world to be gained in a public &s;chool. Euphorion perceiving him&s;elf in a &s;treight between two roads, and not knowing which to prefer, cut the difficulty by taking both; &s;o that Geminus was put under private tuition of the clergyman above mentioned, and Gemellus was taken up to town by the lawyer to be entered at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool.</P>
<P>Euphorion having thus put the two &s;y&s;tems fairly to i&s;&s;ue waited the event, but every time that Gemellus came home at the breaking-up, the private &s;y&s;tem ro&s;e and the public &s;unk on the compari&s;on in the father's mind, for Gemel|lus's appearance no longer kept pace with his brother's; wild and ragged as a colt, battered and brui&s;ed and di&s;hevelled he hardly &s;eemed of the &s;ame &s;pecies with the &s;pruce little ma&s;ter in the parlour; Euphorion was &s;hocked to find that his
<PB N="11" REF="18">
manners were no le&s;s altered than his per&s;on, for he herded with the &s;ervants in the &s;table, was for ever under the hor&s;es' heels, and foremo&s;t in all games and &s;ports with the idle boys of the pari&s;h; this was a &s;ore offence in Euphorion's eyes, for he abhorred low company, and being the fir&s;t gentleman of his family &s;eemed deter|mined to keep up to the title: Misfortunes multiplied upon poor Gemellus, and every thing con&s;pired to put him in complete di&s;grace, for he began to corrupt his brother, and was detect|ed in debauching him to a game at cricket, from which Geminus was brought home with a brui&s;e on the &s;hin, that made a week's work for the &s;urgeon; and what was &s;till wor&s;e, there was conviction of the blow being given by a ball from Gemellus's batt; this brought on a &s;evere interdiction of all further fellow&s;hip between the brothers, and they were effectually kept apart for the future.</P>
<P>A &s;u&s;picion now took place in the father's mind, that Gemellus had made as little progre&s;s in his books, as he had in his manners; but as this was a di&s;covery he could not venture upon in per&s;on, he &s;ub&s;tituted his proxy for the under|taking. Gemellus had &s;o many eva&s;ions and <HI>alibis</HI> in re&s;ource, that it was long before the clergyman could bring the ca&s;e to a hearing, and
<PB N="12" REF="19">
the report was not very favourable in any &s;en&s;e to the unlucky &s;chool-boy, for Gemellus had been &s;eized with a violent fit of &s;neezing in the cri&s;is of examination, to the great annoyance of the worthy preceptor, who was forced to break up the conference <HI>re infect&acirc;</HI> and in &s;ome di&s;order, for among&s;t other damages, which had accrued to his per&s;on and apparel, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the wondering eyes of Euphorion with a huge black bu&s;h wig &s;tuck full of paper darts, and as thickly &s;piked as the back of a porcupine. The culprit was in&s;tantly &s;ummoned and made no other defence, than that <HI>they &s;lipt out of his hand, and he did not go to do it.</HI>
<Q REND="inline">"Are the&s;e your We&s;tmin&s;ter tricks, &s;irrah?"</Q>
cried the angry father, and aiming a blow at his &s;cull with his crutch, brought the wrong per&s;on to the ground; for the nimble culprit had &s;lipt out of the way, and Euphorion, being weak and gouty, literally followed the blow and was laid &s;prawling on the floor: Gemellus flew to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and joint|ly with the par&s;on got him on his legs, but his anger was now &s;o enflamed, that Gemellus was ordered out of the room under &s;entence of im|mediate di&s;mi&s;&s;ion to &s;chool; Euphorion declared he was &s;o totally &s;poilt, that he would not be troubled with him any longer in his family, el&s;e he would in&s;tantly have rever&s;ed his education;
<PB N="13" REF="20">
it was now too late, (he ob&s;erved to the par&s;on, whil&s;t he was drawing the paper darts from his wig,) and therefore he &s;hould return to the place from whence he came, and order was given for pa&s;&s;ing him off by the &s;tage next morning.</P>
<P>A que&s;tion was a&s;ked about his holiday-ta&s;k, but Geminus, who had now entered his father's chamber, in a mild and pacifying tone a&s;&s;ured Euphorion that his brother was provided in that re&s;pect, for that he him&s;elf had done the ta&s;k for him: This was pouring oil upon flame, and the idle culprit was once more called to the bar to receive a mo&s;t &s;evere reprimand for his meanne&s;s in impo&s;ing on his brother's good-nature, with many dunces and blockheads ca&s;t in his teeth, for not being able to do his own bu&s;ine&s;s. Gemellus was nettled with the&s;e reproaches, but more than all with his brother for betraying him, and, drawing the ta&s;k out of his pocket, rolled it in his hand and threw it towards the author, &s;aying
<Q REND="inline">"he was a &s;habby fellow; and for his part he &s;corned to be obliged to any body, that would do a favour and then boa&s;t of it."</Q>&mdash;Re|collecting him&s;elf in a moment afterwards, he turned towards his father, and begged his pardon for all offences;
<Q REND="inline">"he hoped he was not &s;uch a blockhead, but he could do his ta&s;k, if he plea&s;ed, and he would in&s;tantly &s;et about it

Gemellus &s;tood his ground, and after a &s;evere caning was ordered to a&s;k par|don of his brother: This he peremptorily re|fu&s;ed to do, alledging that he had been puni&s;hed already, and to be beaten and beg pardon too was more than he would &s;ubmit to. No me|naces being able to bring this refractory &s;pirit to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he was &s;ent off to &s;chool pennile&s;s, and a letter was written to the ma&s;ter, &s;etting forth his offence, and in &s;trong terms cen&s;uring his want of di&s;cipline for not correcting &s;o &s;tub|born a temper and &s;o idle a di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<P>THIS letter fixed the fate of Gemellus: Re|&s;entments are not ea&s;ily di&s;lodged from narrow minds; Euphorion had not penetration to di&s;tingui&s;h between the characters of his children; he &s;aw no meanne&s;s in the &s;ly in&s;idious manners of his homebred favourite, nor any &s;parks of generous pride in the &s;teady inflexibility of Gemellus; he little knew the high principle of honour, which even the younge&s;t &s;pirits com|municate to each other in the habits and man|ners of a public &s;chool. He bitterly inveighed again&s;t his neighbour the lawyer for per&s;uading him to &s;uch a fatal &s;y&s;tem of education, and whenever they met in company their conver&s;a|tion was engro&s;&s;ed with continual arguings and reproachings; for neither party receded from his point, and Gemellus's advocate was as little di&s;po&s;ed to give him up, as his father was to ex|cu&s;e him. At la&s;t they came to a compromi&s;e, by which Euphorion agreed to charge his e&s;tate
<PB N="18" REF="25">
with an annuity for the education and &s;upport of Gemellus, which annuity during his nonage was to be received and admini&s;tered by the &s;aid awyer, and Geminus left heir of his whole for|tune, this moderate encumbrance excepted.</P>
<P>The di&s;intere&s;ted and pro&s;cribed offender was now turned over to the care of the lawyer, who regularly defrayed his &s;chool expences, and ne|ver failed to vi&s;it him at tho&s;e periods, when country practitioners u&s;ually re&s;ort to town. The boy, apprized of his &s;ituation, took no fur|ther pains to a&s;&s;uage his father's re&s;entment, but full of re&s;ources within him&s;elf, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an active and a&s;piring genius, pre&s;&s;ed forward in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;oon found him&s;elf at the head of the &s;chool, with the reputation of being the be&s;t &s;cholar in it.</P>
<P>He had formed a clo&s;e friend&s;hip, according to the cu&s;tom of great &s;chools, with a boy of his own age, the &s;on of a nobleman of high di&s;tinc|tion, in who&s;e family Gemellus was a great fa|vourite, and where he never failed to pa&s;s his holidays, when the &s;chool adjourned. His good friend and guardian the lawyer &s;aw the advan|tages of this early connection in their proper light, and readily con&s;ented to admit his ward of the &s;ame college in the univer&s;ity, when Gemel|lus and his friend had compleated their &s;chool
<PB N="19" REF="26">
education. Here the attachment of the&s;e young men became more and more &s;olid, as they ad|vanced nearer to manhood, and after a cour&s;e of academical &s;tudies, in which Gemellus &s;till im|proved the reputation he brought from We&s;t|min&s;ter, it was propo&s;ed that he &s;hould accom|pany his friend upon his travels, and a proper governor was engaged for that &s;ervice. This propo&s;al rather &s;taggered Gemellus's guardian on the &s;core of expence, and he now found it nece&s;&s;ary for the fir&s;t time to open him&s;elf to Euphorion. With this intent he called upon him one morning, and taking him a&s;ide, told him, he was come to confer with him on the &s;ubject of Gemellus&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry for it,"</Q> inter|po&s;ed Euphorion. <Q REND="inline">"Hold, Sir,"</Q> an&s;wered the lawyer,
<Q REND="inline">"interrupt me not, if you plea&s;e; tho' Gemellus is my ward, he is your &s;on; and if you have the natural feelings of a father, you will be proud to acknowledge your right in him as &s;uch."</Q>&mdash;As he was &s;peaking the&s;e words, an awkward &s;ervant bur&s;t into the room, and &s;taring with fright and confu&s;ion, told his ma&s;ter there was a great lord in a fine equipage had actually driven up to the hall door, and was a&s;king to &s;peak with him. Euphorion's &s;urprize was now little le&s;s than his &s;ervant's, and not being in the habit of receiving vi&s;its from people
<PB N="20" REF="27">
of di&s;tinction, he eagerly demanded of the lawyer who this vi&s;itor could po&s;&s;ibly be, and ca&s;ting an eye of embarra&s;&s;ment upon his gouty foot&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I am not fit to be &s;een,"</Q>
&s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline">"and cannot tell how to e&s;cape; for heaven's fake! go and &s;ee who this vi&s;itor is, and keep him from the &s;ight of me, if it be po&s;&s;ible."</Q></P>
<P>Euphorion had &s;carce done &s;peaking, when the door was thrown open, and the noble &s;tran|ger, who was no le&s;s a per&s;on than the father of Gemellus's friend, made his approach, and hav|ing introduced him&s;elf to Euphorion, and apolo|gized for the abruptne&s;s of his vi&s;it, proceeded to explain the occa&s;ion of it in the following words:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I wait upon you, Sir, with a reque&s;t, in which I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall be &s;econded by this worthy gentleman here pre&s;ent: You have the honour to be father to one of the mo&s;t amiable and accompli&s;hed young men I ever knew; it may not become me to &s;peak &s;o warmly of my own &s;on as perhaps I might with truth, but I flatter my&s;elf it will be &s;ome recommendation of him to your good opinion, when I tell you that he is the friend and inti|mate of your Gemellus: They have now gone through &s;chool and college together, and ac|cording to my notions of the world &s;uch early connections, when they are well cho&s;en, are
<PB N="21" REF="28">
among&s;t the chief advantages of a public edu|cation; but as I now purpo&s;e to &s;end my &s;on upon his travels, and in &s;uch a manner as I flatter my&s;elf will be for his benefit and im|provement, I hope you will pardon this intru|&s;ion, when I inform you that the object of it is to &s;olicit your con&s;ent that Gemellus may accompany him."</Q></P>
<P>Euphorion's countenance, whil&s;t this &s;peech was addre&s;&s;ed to him, underwent a variety of changes; &s;urprize at hearing &s;uch an unexpected character of his &s;on was &s;trongly expre&s;t; a gleam of joy &s;eemed to break out, but was &s;oon di&s;pelled by &s;hame and vexation at the reflection of having abandoned him; he attempted to &s;peak, but confu&s;ion choaked him; he ca&s;t a look of embarra&s;&s;ment upon the lawyer, but the joy and triumph, which his features exhibited, appeared to him like in&s;ult, and he turned his eyes on the ground in &s;ilence and de&s;pair. No one emotion had e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of Gemellus's pa|tron, who, turning to the lawyer, &s;aid he believed he need not affect to be ignorant of Gemellus's &s;ituation, and then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf again to Euphorion&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I can readily under&s;tand,"</Q> &s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline">"that &s;uch a propo&s;al as I have now opened to you, however advantageous it might promi&s;e to be to your &s;on, would not corre&s;pond with
<PB N="22" REF="29">
your ideas in point of expence, nor come within the compa&s;s of that limited provi&s;ion, which you have thought fit to appoint for him: This is a matter, of which I have no preten|&s;ions to &s;peak; you have di&s;po&s;ed of your for|tune between your &s;ons in the proportions you thought fit, and it mu&s;t be owned a youth, who has had a dome&s;tic education, &s;tands the mo&s;t in need of a father's help, from the little chance there is of his being able to take care of him&s;elf: Gemellus has talents that mu&s;t &s;ecure his fortune, and if my &s;ervices can a&s;&s;i&s;t him, they &s;hall never be wanting; in the mean time it is very little for me to &s;ay that my pur&s;e will furni&s;h their joint occa&s;ions, whil&s;t they are on their travels, and Gemellus's little fund, which is in hone&s;t and friendly hands, will accumulate in the interim."</Q></P>
<P>The length of this &s;peech would have given Euphorion time to recollect him&s;elf, if the matter of it had not pre&s;ented &s;ome unplea&s;ant truths to his reflection, which incapacitated him from making a deliberate reply; he made a &s;hift how|ever to hammer out &s;ome broken &s;entences, and with as good a grace as he could, attempted to palliate his neglect of Gemellus by pleading his infirm &s;tate of health, and retirement from the
<PB N="23" REF="30">
world&mdash;he had put him into the hands of his friend, who was pre&s;ent, and as he be&s;t knew what an&s;wer to give to the propo&s;al in que&s;tion, he referred his lord&s;hip to him and would abide by his deci&s;ion&mdash;he was glad to hear &s;o favourable an account of him&mdash;it was far beyond his expec|tations; he hoped his lord&s;hip's partiality would not be deceived in him, and he was thankful for the kind expre&s;&s;ions he had thrown out of his future good offices and protection.&mdash;The noble vi&s;itor now de&s;ired leave to introduce his &s;on, who was waiting in the coach, and hoped Ge|mellus might be allowed to pay his duty at the &s;ame time. This was a &s;urprize upon Eupho|rion, which he could not parry, and the young friends were immediately u&s;hered in by the exulting lawyer. Gemellus commanded him&s;elf with great addre&s;s; but the father's look, when be fir&s;t di&s;covered an elegant and manly youth in the bloom of health and comeline&s;s, with an open countenance, where genius, courage and philanthropy were characterized, is not to be de|&s;cribed: It was a mixt expre&s;&s;ion of &s;hame, con|viction and repentance; nature had her &s;hare in it; parental love &s;eemed to catch a glance, as it were, by &s;tealth; he was &s;ilent, and his lips qui|vered with the &s;uppre&s;t emotions of his heart. Gemellus approached and made an humble
<PB N="24" REF="31">
obei&s;ance; Euphorion &s;tretched forth his hand; he &s;eized it between his, and reverently pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips. Their meeting was not interrupt|ed by a word, and the &s;ilence was only broken by my lord, who told Gemellus in a low voice, that his father had con&s;ented to his reque&s;t, and he had no longer cau&s;e to apprehend a &s;eparation from his friend: The hone&s;t lawyer now could no longer repre&s;s his ec&s;tacy, but running to Gemellus, who met his embrace with open arms, &s;howered a flood of tears upon his neck, and received the tribute of gratitude and affec|tion in return upon his own.</P>
<P>When their &s;pirits were a little compo&s;ed, Gemellus reque&s;ted to &s;ee his brother; a &s;um|mons was accordingly i&s;&s;ued, and Geminus made his entrance. The contra&s;t which this meeting exhibited, &s;poke in &s;tronger terms than language can &s;upply the decided preference of a public and liberal &s;y&s;tem of education, to the narrow maxims of private and dome&s;tic tuition. On Gemellus's part all was candour, openne&s;s and cordiality; he hoped all childi&s;h differences were forgiven; for his &s;hare, if he called them to re|membrance, it was only to regret, that he had been &s;o long &s;eparated from a brother, who was naturally &s;o dear to him; for the remainder of their lives he per&s;uaded him&s;elf they &s;hould be
<PB N="25" REF="32">
twins in affection, as well as in birth. On the &s;ide of Geminus there was &s;ome acting, and &s;ome nature; but both were &s;pecimens of the wor&s;t &s;ort; hypocri&s;y played his part but awk|wardly, and nature gave a &s;orry &s;ample of her performances.</P>
<P>A few words will &s;uffice to wind up their hi&s;tories, &s;o far at lea&s;t as they need be explain|ed: Euphorion died &s;oon after this interview; Geminus inherited his fortune, and upon his very fir&s;t coming to London was cajoled into a di&s;graceful marriage with a ca&s;t-off mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he became acquainted with; duped by a profligate and plundered by &s;harpers, he made a mi&s;erable wa&s;te both of money and reputation, and in the event became a pen&s;ioner of his bro|ther. Gemellus with great natural talents, im|proved by education and experience, with an excellent nature and a laudable ambition, &s;e|conded by a very powerful connection, &s;oon ro&s;e to a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ituation in the &s;tate, where he yet continues to act a con&s;picuous part, to the honour of his country, and with no le&s;s reputa|tion to him&s;elf.</P>

<P>It is to the honour of our nation, that we tolerate them in the exerci&s;e of their religion, for which the Inqui&s;ition would tie them to a &s;take and commit them to the flames. In &s;ome parts of the world the burning of a few makes a fe&s;tival for all good Chri&s;tians; it brings rain and plenty in &s;ea&s;ons of drought and famine; it makes atonement for the &s;ins of the people, and mitigates the wrath of an avenging Providence. Wherever they are obliged to conceal their re|ligion, they generally overact their hypocri&s;y, and crowd their hou&s;es with &s;aints and virgins, whil&s;t crucifixes, charms and relicks are hung in numbers round their necks. The &s;on of Jewi&s;h parents is brought up in the mo&s;t rigid exerci&s;es of mortification and penance, and when the de&s;tined moment is in near approach, when the parent mu&s;t impart the dreadful &s;ecret of his faith, every contrivance is put in practice to di&s;gu&s;t and weary him with the laborious func|tions of their o&s;ten&s;ible religion: When this preparatory rigour is perceived to take effect, and the age of the &s;on is ripe for the occa&s;ion, the father takes him into the inmo&s;t chamber of

<P>If I had really that intere&s;t with my ingenious contemporaries, which <HI>Mr. Abrahams</HI> gives me credit for, I would not he&s;itate to exert it in his &s;ervice; but as I am afraid this is not the ca&s;e,
<PB N="33" REF="40">
I have taken the only method in my power of being u&s;eful to him, and have publi&s;hed his letter.</P>
<P>As for Shylock, who is &s;o obnoxious to my corre&s;pondent, I wi&s;h I could prove him the &s;on of a Samaritan as clearly as Simon Magus; but I flatter my&s;elf the next be&s;t thing for his pur|po&s;e is to prove him the &s;on of a poet, and that I will endeavour to do in my very next paper, with this further &s;atisfaction to <HI>Mr. Abrahams,</HI> that I do not de&s;pair of taking him down a &s;tep in his pedigree, which for a poetical one is, as it now &s;tands, of the very fir&s;t family in the king|dom.</P>
<P>As for the vulgar fun of <HI>&s;moaking a Jew,</HI> which &s;o prevails among&s;t us, I am per&s;uaded that my countrymen are much too generous and good-natured to &s;port with the feelings of a fel|low-creature, if they were once fairly convinced that a Jew is their fellow-creature, and really has fellow-feelings with their own: Satisfy them in this point, and their humanity will do the re&s;t: I will therefore hope that nothing more is wanting in behalf of my corre&s;pondent, (who &s;eems a very worthy man) than to put the fol|lowing &s;hort que&s;tions to his per&s;ecutors&mdash;<HI>Hath not a Jew eyes?

<HI>the &s;ame food, hurt with the &s;ame weapons, &s;ubject to the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es, healed by the &s;ame means, warmed and cooled by the &s;ame &s;ummer and win|ter, as a Chri&s;tian is? If you prick them, do they not bleed? If you tickle them, do they not laugh? If you poi&s;on them, do they not die?</HI>&mdash;The man, who can give a &s;erious an&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;tions, and yet per&s;i&s;t in per&s;ecuting an unoffending being, becau&s;e he is a Jew, whatever country he may claim, or whatever religion he may profe&s;s, has the &s;oul of an inqui&s;itor, and is fit for no|thing el&s;e but to feed the fires of an <HI>Auto da F&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>When I turn my thoughts to the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent &s;ituation of this peculiar people, I do not &s;ee how any Chri&s;tian nation according to the &s;pirit of their religion can refu&s;e admi&s;&s;ion to the Jews, who, in completion of tho&s;e very pro|phecies, on which Chri&s;tianity re&s;ts, are to be &s;cattered and di&s;&s;eminated among&s;t all people and nations over the face of the earth. It &s;eems therefore a thing as incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of tho&s;e prophecies for any one nation to attempt to expel them, as it would be to incorporate them.</P>
<P>The &s;in and obduracy of their forefathers are among&s;t the undoubted records of our go&s;pel, but I doubt if this can be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on,
<PB N="35" REF="42">
why we &s;hould hold them in &s;uch general odium through &s;o many ages, &s;eeing how naturally the &s;on follows the faith of the father, and how much too general a thing it is among&s;t mankind to profe&s;s any particular form of religion, that de|volves upon them by inheritance, rather than by free election and conviction of rea&s;on founded upon examination.</P>
<P>Let me put the ca&s;e of a man born a Jew and &s;ettled in a kingdom, where the Inqui&s;ition is in force; can he reconcile his natural feelings to a conver&s;ion in favour of that church, which de|nounces everla&s;ting damnation again&s;t him, if he does not betray the &s;ecrets of his parents, and impeach them to the Inqui&s;ition for the concealed religion, which he knows they prac|ti&s;e, though they do not profe&s;s.</P>
<P>If we as Chri&s;tians owe &s;ome re&s;pect to the Jews as the people cho&s;en by God to be the keepers of tho&s;e prophetic records, which an|nounce the coming of the Me&s;&s;ias, we owe it al&s;o to the truth of hi&s;tory to confe&s;s, that the hope indulged by them that his coming would bring temporal as well as &s;piritual &s;alvation, was general to all the nation. Their antient &s;ages had united the military with the prophetic cha|racter; &s;ome had headed their armies; all had gone forth with them, and even their women
<PB N="36" REF="43">
had contributed to the downfal of their enemies and oppre&s;&s;ors: They had been delivered from their Egyptian and Babyloni&s;h thraldom by the arm of God; the yoke of Rome laid no le&s;s heavy on their necks; and they regarded their former deliverances as types and forerunners of the greater deliverance to come, when the Son of God &s;hould de&s;cend upon earth in the pleni|tude of his power to rid them from their enemies and oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>In place of this glittering but delu&s;ive vi&s;ion they beheld a meek and humble man, a teacher of peaceful doctrines, who went about preaching forgivene&s;s of injuries and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to autho|rities. They a&s;ked him (and the que&s;tion was a proving one) whether he would have them render tribute unto Cae&s;ar: He told them in reply they &s;hould render unto Cae&s;ar the things that were Cae&s;ar's, tribute to whom tribute was due: Mortifying reply! extingui&s;hing at once their hopes and their ambition. Still there was &s;omething about him that converted many and &s;taggered all; never man &s;poke as he &s;poke, ne|ver man did what he did; he had evident power of working miracles; the hand of God was with him and the operations of nature were under his controul: His power was great, but was not great to their purpo&s;es, and therefore they denied that
<PB N="37" REF="44">
it was derived from God; they charged him with being a magician, and ca&s;ting out devils by the aid of the prince of the devils: A likely inter|cour&s;e between the repre&s;entatives of light and of darkne&s;s; a notable collu&s;ion between heaven and hell; if Beelzebub was to be charged with con&s;piring to ca&s;t out Beelzebub, it was at lea&s;t incumbent on the abettors of the charge to prove that any being, endowed with &s;uch power could be &s;o devoid of intelligence.</P>
<P>Conviction and rebuke only rendered them more furious and inveterate; de&s;pairing at length of employing his power again&s;t Rome, they re|&s;olved upon turning the power of Rome again&s;t him: They impeached him before Pilate the Roman procurator; Pilate unwillingly at their urgent requi&s;ition &s;entenced him to ignominious execution; di&s;avowing in the &s;tronge&s;t terms his &s;hare in the act, and by the figurative exculpa|tion of wa&s;hing his hands in public view, puri|fying, (as far as &s;uch a ceremony could purify) his tribunal from the guilt of &s;pilling innocent blood.</P>
<P>Can it be a wonder with us at this hour that the Jews &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in avowing their unbelief in the Me&s;&s;ias? If they admit the evidences of the Chri&s;tian religion, do they not become their own accu&s;ers? And this, although it be no rea|&s;on
<PB N="38" REF="45">
why a man &s;hould &s;hut his eyes again&s;t the truth, will yet be a motive, allowing for the im|perfection of human nature, why he &s;hould not &s;eek for it.</P>

<P>I SLIGHTLY hinted in my former paper that the Jew of Venice would not turn out to be the proper offspring of Shake&s;pear, and as the re&s;earches of his commentators have &s;ettled this point &s;o clearly again&s;t the legitimacy of Shylock, I may leave it with the reader's judg|ment to decide, whether he formed his drama immediately from the <HI>Pecorone</HI> of <HI>Fiorentina,</HI> borrowing the incident of the ca&s;kets from Boc|cace; or at &s;econd hand, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, from an old ballad formed upon that &s;tory.</P>
<P>But I had a further object in the hint I then dropt, &s;ugge&s;ted to me by the peru&s;al of a very curious old novel written by <HI>Thomas Na&s;he,</HI> and publi&s;hed in 1594, intitled <HI>The Unfortunate Tra|veller, or the Life of Jacke Wilton.</HI> The hero is de&s;cribed to be one of the court-pages belong|ing to Henry the Eighth, and is made to play a number of rogui&s;h pranks in the camp of that

monarch before Tournay. He travels to Mun|&s;ter in Germany, where he falls in with John of Leyden the famous fanatic, and is pre&s;ent at his defeat by the Imperiali&s;ts; here he meets Lord Henry Howard, Earl of Surry, and accom|panies him to Venice, pa&s;&s;ing through Witten|berg, where he has an interview with Luther and Carlo&s;tadius; from thence he repairs to Rome, where he relates a &s;eries of &s;trange ad|ventures, by which he is thrown into the hands of a Jew named Zadock, phy&s;ician to Pope Clement VIII. and having forfeited his life to him by the law, the Jew gets the per&s;on of Jack Wilton in limbo with an intent to anatomize him, and whil&s;t he is dieting and bleeding him for that purpo&s;e, the Marchione&s;s of Mantua, the Pope's mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;pies him out from her bal|cony, and being &s;mitten with his appearance, contrives to get him out of Zadock's hands, by per&s;uading his holine&s;s to bani&s;h all the Jews from Rome and confi&s;cate their effects, upon a charge &s;he &s;ets up again&s;t them.</P>
<P>With this intelligence Zadock is acco&s;ted by a brother Jew called Zachary,
<Q REND="inline">"who comes running to him in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes, pre|&s;ently after his goods were confi&s;cated, and tells him how he is &s;erved and what decree is coming out again&s;t them all."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="47">I have made an extract of this interview be|tween Zadock and Zachary, which the reader will ob&s;erve by the date was publi&s;hed before Shake&s;pear wrote his Merchant of Venice, and as the critics &s;eem agreed that he was conver&s;ant in other works of Na&s;he, it is highly probable that this hi&s;tory of <HI>Jacke Wilton</HI> had al&s;o been in his hands: I do not mean to infer that Shake|&s;pear took his character of Shylock from this of Na&s;he's Zadock, for there is nothing that can warrant &s;uch an inference; but I &s;hall &s;ubmit the following dialogue as an extraordinary &s;pecimen of &s;trong empa&s;&s;ioned writing, which, though it will not &s;tand by Shake&s;pear's &s;cene between Shylock and Tubal in dramatic ter&s;ene&s;s, has neverthele&s;s a force of expre&s;&s;ion, that will bear a compari&s;on with that or any other pa&s;&s;age in our old dramatic writers.</P>

<P>From Spain what bringeth our traveller? A &s;cull-crowned hat of the fa&s;hion of an old deep porringer; a diminutive alderman's ru&s;t with &s;hort &s;trings, like the droppings of a man's no&s;e; a clo&s;e-bellied doublet coming down with a peake behind as far as the crup|per, and cut off before by the brea&s;t-bone like a partlet or neckercher; a wide pair of ga&s;|coynes, which ungathered would make a cou|ple of women's riding-kirtles; huge hangers, that have half a cow-hide in them; a rapier that is lineally de&s;cended from half a dozen dukes at the lea&s;t: Let his cloak be as long or as &s;hort as you will; if long, it is faced with Turkey grogeran ravelled; if &s;hort, it hath a cape like a calf's tongue, and is not &s;o

<P>I WAS &s;ome nights ago much entertained with an excellent repre&s;entation of Mr. Congreve's comedy of <HI>The Double Dealer.</HI> When I reflected upon the youth of the author and the merit of the play, I acknowledged the truth of what the late Dr. Samuel John&s;on &s;ays in his life of this poet, that <HI>among&s;t all the efforts of early genius, which literary hi&s;tory records, I doubt whether any one can be produced that more &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="54">
<HI>the common limits of nature than the plays of Congreve.</HI></P>
<P>The author of this comedy in his dedication informs us, that he <HI>de&s;igned the moral fir&s;t, and to that moral invented the fable</HI>; and does not know <HI>that he has borrowed one hint of it any where.&mdash;I made the plot,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>as &s;trong as I could; becau&s;e it was &s;ingle; and I made it &s;ingle becau&s;e I would avoid confu&s;ion, and was re&s;olved to pre&s;erve the three unities of the drama.</HI> As it is impo&s;&s;ible not to give full credit to this a&s;&s;ertion, I mu&s;t con&s;ider the re&s;emblance which many circum&s;tances in <HI>The Double Dealer</HI> bear to tho&s;e in a comedy of Beaumont and Fletcher, intitled <HI>Cupid's Revenge,</HI> as a ca&s;ual coinci|dence; and I think the learned biographer above quoted had good rea&s;on to pronounce of Congreve, <HI>that he is an original writer, who borrowed neither the models of his plot, nor the manner of his dialogue.</HI></P>
<P>Mellafont, the nephew and heir of Lord Touchwood, being engaged to Cynthia, daugh|ter of Sir Paul Pliant, the traver&s;ing this match forms the object of the plot, on which this co|medy of <HI>The Double Dealer</HI> is con&s;tructed; the intrigue con&s;i&s;ts in the various artifices employed by Lady Touchwood and her agents for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="55">That the object is (as the author him&s;elf &s;tates it to be) <HI>&s;ingly</HI> this, will appear upon con|&s;idering, that, although the ruin of Mellafont's fortune is for a time effected by the&s;e contri|vances, that are employed for traver&s;ing his marriage, yet it is rather a mea&s;ure of nece&s;&s;ity and &s;elf-defence in Lady Touchwood, than of original de&s;ign; it &s;prings from the artifice of incident, and belongs more properly to the in|trigue, than to the object of the plot.</P>
<P>The making or ob&s;tructing marriages is the common hinge, on which mo&s;t comic fables are contrived to turn, but in this match of Mella|font's, which the author has taken for the ground-work of his plot, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that it would have been better to have given more in|tere&s;t to an event, which he has made the main object of the play: He has taken little pains to recommend the parties to his &s;pectators, or to paint their mutual attachment with any warmth of colouring. Who will feel any concern whe|ther Mellafont marries Cynthia or not, if they them&s;elves appear indifferent on the occa&s;ion, and upon the eve of their nuptials conver&s;e in the following &s;train?<Q><PB N="49" REF="56"><SP>

</SP></Q> This &s;cene, which proceeds throughout in the &s;ame &s;train, &s;eems to confirm Dr. John&s;on's re|mark, that <HI>Congreve formed a peculiar idea of comic excellence, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t in gay remarks and unexpected an&s;wers</HI>&mdash;that <HI>his &s;cenes exhibit not much of humour, imagery or pa&s;&s;ion; his per&s;onages are a kind of intellectual gladiators; every &s;entence is toward or &s;trike; the conte&s;t of &s;martne&s;s is never intermitted; and his wit is a meteor playing to and fro with alternate coru&s;|cations.</HI></P>
<P>There is but one more interview between Cynthia and Mellafont, which is the opening of the fourth act, and this is of &s;o flat and in&s;ipid a &s;ort, as to be with rea&s;on omitted in repre|&s;entation: I think therefore it may be ju&s;tly ob|&s;erved,

<P>Having remarked upon the object of the plot, I &s;hall next con&s;ider the intrigue; and for this purpo&s;e we mu&s;t methodically trace the conduct of Lady Touchwood, who is the poet's chief engine, and that of her under-agent Ma&s;kwell.</P>
<P>The &s;cene lies in Lord Touchwood's hou&s;e, but whether in town or country does not appear. Sir Paul Pliant, his lady and daughter, are natu|rally brought thither, upon the day preceding Cynthia's marriage, to adju&s;t the &s;ettlement: Lord and Lady Froth, Carele&s;s and Bri&s;k, are vi&s;iters on the occa&s;ion; Mellafont and Ma&s;k|well are inmates: This di&s;po&s;ition is as happy as can be devi&s;ed. The incident related by Mellafont to Carele&s;s, of the attempt upon him made by Lady Touchwood, artfully prepares us to expect every thing that revenge and pa&s;&s;ion can &s;ugge&s;t for fru&s;trating his happine&s;s; and it is judicious to repre&s;ent Mellafont incredulous as to the criminality of Ma&s;kwell's intercour&s;e with Lady Touchwood; for if he had believed it upon Carele&s;s's &s;ugge&s;tion, it would have made his

blindne&s;s to the character of Ma&s;kwell not only weak, (which in fact it is) but unnatural and even guilty.</P>
<P>Ma&s;kwell in the fir&s;t act makes general pro|mi&s;es to Lady Touchwood that he will defeat Mellafont's match&mdash;<HI>You &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s and ruin him too.</HI>&mdash;The lady pre&s;&s;es him to explain par|ticulars; he opens no other re&s;ource but that of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Lady Pliant with an idea that Mellafont is fond of her&mdash;<HI>She mu&s;t be thoroughly per&s;uaded that Mellafont loves her.</HI>&mdash;So &s;hallow a contri|vance as this cannot e&s;cape the lady's penetra|tion, and &s;he naturally an&s;wers&mdash;<HI>I don't &s;ee what you can propo&s;e from &s;o trifling a de&s;ign; for her fir&s;t conver&s;ing with Mellafont will convince her of the contrary.</HI>&mdash;In fact, the author's good &s;en&s;e was well aware how weak this expedient is, and it &s;eems applied to no other purpo&s;e than as an incident to help on the under-plot, by bringing forward the comic effect of Lady Pliant's character, and that of Sir Paul: Ma&s;kwell him&s;elf is &s;o fairly gravelled by the ob&s;ervation, that he confe&s;&s;es he <HI>does not depend upon it</HI>; but he ob&s;erves that <HI>it will prepare &s;ome|thing el&s;e, and gain him lei&s;ure to lay a &s;tronger plot; if I gain a little time,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I &s;hall not want contrivance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="59">In the &s;econd act this de&s;ign upon Lady Pliant is played off, and Ma&s;kwell in an interview with Mellafont avows the plot, and &s;ays&mdash;<HI>to tell you the truth, I encouraged it for your diver&s;ion.</HI> He proceeds to &s;ay, that in order to gain the confi|dence of Lady Touchwood, <HI>he had pretended to have been long &s;ecretly in love with Cynthia</HI>; that thereby he had drawn forth <HI>the &s;ecrets of her heart,</HI> and that <HI>if he accompli&s;hed her de&s;igns, &s;he had engaged to put Cynthia with all her fortune into his power:</HI> He then di&s;clo&s;es by &s;oliloquy that his motive for <HI>double dealing</HI> was founded in his pa&s;&s;ion for Cynthia, and ob&s;erves that <HI>the name of rival cuts all ties a&s;under and is a general acquittance.</HI> This proceeding is in nature and is good co|medy.</P>
<P>The third act opens with a &s;cene between Lord and Lady Touchwood, which is admirably con|ceived and executed with great &s;pirit; I que&s;tion if there is any thing of the author &s;uperior to this dialogue. The de&s;ign of alarming the jealou&s;y and re&s;entment of Lord Touchwood now appears to have originated with the lady, although Ma&s;kwell was privy to it, and <HI>ready for a cue to come in and confirm all, had there been occa&s;ion</HI>; he propo&s;es to her to &s;ay that he was <HI>privy to Mellafont's de&s;ign, but that he u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours to di&s;&s;uade him from it</HI>; and on the credit, he thinks to
<PB N="53" REF="60">
e&s;tabli&s;h by this proof of his honour and hone&s;ty, he grounds another plot, which he keeps as his ultimate and mo&s;t &s;ecret re&s;ource, that <HI>of cheating her</HI> [Lady Touchwood] <HI>as well as the re&s;t.</HI> He now reveals to Mellafont a criminal a&s;&s;ignation with Lady Touchwood in her chamber at eight, and propo&s;es to him to come and &s;urprize them together, <HI>and then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>it will be hard if you cannot bring her to any conditions.</HI></P>
<P>This appears to me to be a very dangerous experiment, and &s;carce within the bounds of nature and probability. If Ma&s;kwell, under co|ver of the propo&s;al, had in view nothing more than the introduction of Mellafont into Lady Touchwood's bedchamber, there to put them together, and then to bring Lord Touchwood &s;ecretly upon them in the moment of their inter|view, his contrivance could not have been better laid for the purpo&s;e of confirming the impre&s;&s;ion, which that lord had received again&s;t his nephew; in which Ma&s;kwell had nothing more to do than to appri&s;e the lady of his de&s;ign, and &s;he of cour&s;e could have managed the interview to the purpo&s;es of the plot, and effectually have com|pleated the ruin of Mellafont: This, it &s;hould &s;eem, would have an&s;wered his object compleatly, for he would have ri&s;en upon the ruin of Mella|font, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of Lord Touchwood's

favour, bound Lady Touchwood to concealment of his villainy, and been as able to lay his train for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cynthia, as by any other mode he could chu&s;e for obtaining her; but if he put it to the i&s;&s;ue of a &s;urprize upon Lady Touchwood, when &s;he was not prepared for the management of that &s;urprize, what was he to expect from the introduction of Lord Touch|wood, but di&s;covery and defeat? Was it not natural to &s;uppo&s;e Mellafont would &s;eize the opportunity of reproaching her with her crimi|nality with Ma&s;kwell? It was for that very pur|po&s;e he brings him thither; he tells him <HI>it will be hard if he cannot then bring her to any condi|tions</HI>;&mdash;and if this was to pa&s;s under the terror of his reproaches, how could Ma&s;kwell &s;et Lord Touchwood upon li&s;tening to their conver&s;ation and not apprehend for a con&s;equence apparently &s;o unavoidable? He puts every thing to ri&s;que by propo&s;ing to Mellafont to conceal him&s;elf in Lady Touchwood's bedchamber, whil&s;t &s;he is in the clo&s;et; he then meets Lord Touchwood, ap|points him to come to the lobby by the bed-chamber in a quarter of an hour's time; he keeps his a&s;&s;ignation with the lady, Mellafont &s;tarts from his hiding-place, and Ma&s;kwell e&s;capes, but &s;oon returns, &s;ecretly introducing Lord Touchwood to li&s;ten to the dialogue be|tween

his lady and nephew: She accidentally di&s;covers him without his being &s;een by Mella|font, and turns that accidental di&s;covery again&s;t Mellafont. What a combination of improbabili|ties is here fortuitou&s;ly thrown together to pro|duce this lucky incident! Could Ma&s;kwell rea|&s;onably pre&s;ume upon a chance &s;o beyond ex|pectation? Every thing is made to turn upon the precarious point of a minute: If Lord Touch|wood, who was appointed for a quarter of an hour, had anticipated that appointment, if Lady Touchwood had been le&s;s punctual to her a&s;|&s;ignation, if Mellafont had happened to have dropt one word in his uncle's hearing, charging her with his di&s;covery, as had been agreed, or if either &s;he had happened not to have &s;een Lord Touchwood, of Mellafont had &s;een him; in &s;hort, if any one thing had turned up, which ought to have come to pa&s;s, or otherwi&s;e than it was made to come to pa&s;s by the greate&s;t violence to probability, Ma&s;kwell was inevitably undone: It mu&s;t be owned he laid a train for his own de&s;truction, but &s;tage incident re&s;cued him; and this, with the lady's adroitne&s;s, effaces the improbability, when it pa&s;&s;es in repre&s;enta|tion, and keeps nature out of &s;ight. Had Mel|lafont told the plain &s;tory to his uncle, after Lady Touchwood had &s;o unexpectedly turned it
<PB N="56" REF="63">
again&s;t him, it would at lea&s;t have put the plot to ri&s;que, and of this the author &s;eems &s;o con|&s;cious, that he does not &s;uffer him to attempt a &s;ingle word in his defence; to &s;ave his villain, he is compelled to &s;acrifice his hero.</P>
<P>It is not &s;ufficient to &s;ay that a poet has his characters in his power, and can fa&s;hion inci|dents according to his own di&s;cretion; he mu&s;t do no violence to nature and probability for the purpo&s;es of his plot.</P>
<P>Ma&s;kwell having in this manner e&s;caped with &s;ucce&s;s, begins next to put in execution his plot for obtaining Cynthia, and this con&s;titutes the intrigue and cata&s;trophe of the fifth act: His plan is as follows&mdash;Having imparted to Lord Touchwood his love for Cynthia by the vehicle of a &s;oliloquy, which is to be overheard by his lord&s;hip, he propo&s;es to him&s;elf to carry off Cyn|thia to St. Albans with the chaplain in the coach, there to be married; this &s;he is to be trepanned into by per&s;uading her that the chap|lain is Mellafont, and Mellafont is brought to co-operate, by a promi&s;e that he &s;hall elope with Cynthia under that di&s;gui&s;e, and that the chap|lain &s;hall be made to follow on the day after and then marry him to Cynthia; with this view Mel|lafont is appointed to meet Ma&s;kwell in one chamber, and Cynthia in another; the real chap|lain
<PB N="57" REF="64">
is to be pa&s;&s;ed upon the lady for Mellafont, and Mellafont is to be left in the lurch; this plot upon Cynthia Ma&s;kwell confides to Lord Touchwood, telling him there is no other way to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of her but by &s;urprize.</P>
<P>Though the author undoubtedly meant his villain &s;hould in the end outwit him&s;elf, yet he did not mean him to attempt impo&s;&s;ibilities, and the ab&s;urdities of this contrivance are &s;o many, that I know not which to mention fir&s;t. How was Ma&s;kwell to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of Cynthia by this &s;cheme? By what force or fraud is he to ac|compli&s;h the object of marrying her? We mu&s;t conclude he was not quite &s;o de&s;perate as to &s;acrifice all his hopes from Lord Touchwood by any violence upon her per&s;on; there is nothing in his character to warrant the conjecture. It is no le&s;s unaccountable how Mellafont could be caught by this project, and induced to equip him&s;elf in the chaplain's gown to run off with a lady, who had pledged her&s;elf to him never to marry any other man: There was no want of con&s;ent on her part; a reconciliation with Lord Touchwood was the only object he had to look to, and how was that to be effected by this elopement with Cynthia?</P>
<P>The jealou&s;y of Lady Touchwood was another rock on which Ma&s;kwell was &s;ure to &s;plit: It
<PB N="58" REF="65">
would have been natural for him to have pro|vided again&s;t this danger by binding my lord to &s;ecrecy, and the lady's pride of family was a ready plea for that purpo&s;e; when he was talking to him&s;elf for the purpo&s;e of being overheard by Lord Touchwood, he had nothing to do but to throw in this ob&s;ervation among&s;t the re&s;t to bar that point again&s;t di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The reader will not &s;uppo&s;e I would &s;ugge&s;t a plan of operation for <HI>The Double Dealer</HI> to &s;ecure him again&s;t di&s;covery; I am only for adding pro|bability and common precaution to his projects: I allow that it is in character for him to grow wanton with &s;ucce&s;s; there is a moral in a villain outwitting him&s;elf; but the cata&s;trophe would in my opinion have been far more brilliant, if his &s;chemes had broke up with more force of contrivance; laid as they are, they melt away and di&s;&s;olve by their own weakne&s;s and incon|&s;i&s;tency; Lord and Lady Touchwood, Carele&s;s and Cynthia, all join in the di&s;covery; every one but Mellafont &s;ees through the plot, and he is blindne&s;s it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Congreve, in his dedication above men|tioned, defends him&s;elf again&s;t the objection to &s;oliloquies; but I conceive he is more open to critici&s;m for the frequent u&s;e he makes of li&s;ten|ing;

Lord Touchwood three times has recour&s;e to this expedient.</P>
<P>Of the characters in this comedy Lady Touch|wood, though of an unfavourable ca&s;t, &s;eems to have been the chief care of the poet, and is well pre&s;erved throughout; her elevation of tone, nearly approaching to the tragic, affords a &s;trong relief to the lighter &s;ketches of the epi&s;odical per&s;ons, Sir Paul and Lady Pliant, Lord and Lady Froth, who are highly entertaining, but much more loo&s;e than the &s;tage in its pre&s;ent &s;tate of reformation would endure: Nothing more can be &s;aid of Carele&s;s and Bri&s;k, than that they are the young men of the theatre, at the time when they were in repre&s;entation. Of Ma&s;kwell enough has been &s;aid in the&s;e remarks, nor need any thing be added to what has been already ob&s;erved upon Mellafont and Cynthia. As for the moral of the play, which the author &s;ays he de&s;igned in the fir&s;t place and then ap|plied the fable to it, it &s;hould &s;eem to have been his principal object in the formation of the co|medy, and yet it is not made to reach &s;everal characters of very libertine principles, who are left to reform them&s;elves at lei&s;ure; and the plot, though &s;ubordinate to the moral, &s;eems to have drawn him off from executing his good inten|tions

&s;cruple to convert one of the chief temples to this generous u&s;e, and gave it in charge to the prie&s;ts belonging to it to dige&s;t and arrange his collection; when this was done, he laid it open to the public, and by a very appo&s;ite and ingeni|ous device, which he cau&s;ed to be in&s;cribed upon the front of the edifice, invited all his &s;ubjects to enter in and partake of his benefaction: He con&s;idered it as the duty of a good king to pro|vide again&s;t the mental as well as bodily ail|ments of his people; it appeared to him that books were the be&s;t medicines for the mind of man, and con&s;equently that a collection of books, &s;uch as his library contained, might well be in|titled <HI>a magazine or warehou&s;e of medicines for the mind</HI>; with this idea he directed the follow|ing words to be engraved over the door of his li|brary in con&s;picuous characters&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.

<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed that this library of the venerable <HI>O&s;ymanduas</HI> de&s;cended to the Ptolemies, aug|mented probably by the intermediate monarchs, and ultimately brought to perfection by the learned and munificent Philadelphus, &s;on of Ptolemy Lagus, &s;o well known for his Greek tran&s;lation of the Hebrew Septuagint.</P>
<P>Little attention was paid to literature by the Romans in the early and more martial ages: I read of no collections antecedent to tho&s;e made by Aemilius Paulus and Lucullus, the latter of whom, being a man of great magnificence, al|lowed the learned men of his time to have free acce&s;s to his library, but neither in his life time, nor at his death, made it public property. Cornelius Sylla before his dictator&s;hip plun|dered Athens of a great collection of books, which had been accumulating from the time of the tyranny, and the&s;e he brought to Rome, but did not build or endow any library for public u&s;e. This was at la&s;t undertaken by Julius Cae&s;ar upon an imperial &s;cale not long
<PB N="66" REF="73">
before his death, and the learned M. Varro was employed to collect and arrange the books for the foundation of an ample library; its completion, which was interrupted by the death of Julius and the civil wars &s;ub&s;equent thereto, was left for Augu&s;tus, who a&s;&s;igned a fund out of the Dalmatian booty for this purpo&s;e, which he put into the hands of the celebrated A&s;inius Pollio, who therewith founded a temple to Li|berty on Mount Aventine, and with the help of Sylla's and Varro's collections in addition to his own purcha&s;es, opened the fir&s;t public library in Rome in an apartment annexed to the temple above mentioned. Two others were afterwards in&s;tituted by the &s;ame emperor, which he called the <HI>Octavian</HI> and <HI>Palatine Libraries</HI>; the fir&s;t, &s;o named in honour of his &s;i&s;ter, was placed in the temple of Juno; the latter, as its title &s;pecifies, was in the imperial palace: The&s;e libraries were royally endowed with e&s;tabli&s;hments of Greek and Latin librarians, of which C. Julius Hyginus the grammarian was one.</P>
<P>The emperor Tiberius added another li|brary to the palace, and attached his new build|ing to that front which looked towards the <HI>Via &s;acra,</HI> in which quarter he him&s;elf re&s;ided. Ve&s;pa&s;ian endowed a public library in the temple

of peace. Trajan founded the famous <HI>Ulpian Library</HI> in his new forum, from whence it was at la&s;t removed to the <HI>Collis Viminalis</HI> to furni&s;h the baths of Diocle&s;ian. The <HI>Capitoline Li|brary</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been founded by Do|mitian, and was con&s;umed, together with the noble edifice to which it was attached, by a &s;troke of lightning in the time of Commodus. The emperor Hadrian enriched his favourite villa with a &s;uperb collection of books, and lodged them in a temple dedicated to Hercules. The&s;e were in &s;ucceeding times &s;o multiplied by the munificence and emulation of the &s;everal emperors, that in the reign of Con&s;tantine, Rome contained no le&s;s than twenty-nine pub|lic libraries, of which the principal were the <HI>Palatine</HI> and <HI>Ulpian.</HI></P>
<P>Though books were then collected at an im|men&s;e expence, &s;everal private citizens of for|tune made con&s;iderable libraries. Tyrannio the grammarian even in the time of Sylla was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of three thou&s;and volumes; Epaphroditus, a grammarian al&s;o, had in later times collected thirty thou&s;and of the mo&s;t &s;elect and valuable books; but Sammonicus Serenus bequeathed to the emperor Gordian a library containing no le&s;s than &s;ixty-two thou&s;and volumes. It was not always a love of literature that tempted

people to the&s;e expences, for Seneca complains of the vanity of the age in furni&s;hing their ban|quetting rooms with books, not for u&s;e, but for &s;hew, and in a mere &s;pirit of profu&s;ion. Their baths, both hot and cold, were always &s;upplied with books to fill up an idle hour among&s;t the other recreations of the place; in like manner their country hou&s;es and even public offices were provided for the u&s;e and amu&s;ement of their gue&s;ts or clients.</P>
<P>The Roman libraries in point of di&s;po&s;ition much re&s;embled the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion ob&s;erved in our public ones, for the books were not placed again&s;t the walls, but brought into the area of the room in &s;eparate cells and compartments, where they were lodged in pre&s;&s;es: The in|tervals between the&s;e compartments were richly ornamented with inlaid plates of gla&s;s and ivory, and marble ba&s;&s;o-relievos. In the&s;e compart|ments, which were furni&s;hed with de&s;ks and couches for the accommodation of readers, it was u&s;ual to place the &s;tatues of learned men, one in each; and this we may ob&s;erve is one of the few elegancies, which Rome was not indebted to Greece for, the fir&s;t idea having been &s;tarted by the accompli&s;hed Pollio, who in his library on Mount Aventine &s;et up the &s;tatue of his illu&s;trious contemporary Varro,

<P>There is one more circum&s;tance attending the&s;e public libraries, which ought not to be omitted, as it marks the liberal &s;pirit of their in&s;titution: It was u&s;ual to appropriate an ad|joining building for the u&s;e and accommodation of &s;tudents, where every thing was furni&s;hed at the emperor's co&s;t; they were lodged, dieted and attended by &s;ervants &s;pecially appointed, and &s;upplied with every thing, under the eye of the chief librarian, that could be wanting, whil&s;t they were engaged in their &s;tudies and had occa&s;ion to con&s;ult the books: This e&s;tabli&s;h|ment was kept up in a very princely &s;tile at Alexandria in particular, where a college was endowed and a &s;pecial fund appointed for its &s;upport, with a pre&s;ident, and proper officers under him, for the entertainment of learned &s;trangers, who re&s;orted thither from various parts to con&s;ult tho&s;e invaluable collections, which that famous library contained in all branches of &s;cience.</P>

<P>PEOPLE have a cu&s;tom of excu&s;ing the enormities of their conduct by talking of their pa&s;&s;ions, as if they were under the con|troul of a blind nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;inned becau&s;e they could not help it. Before any man re&s;orts to this kind of excu&s;e it behoves him to exa|mine the ju&s;tice of it, and to be &s;ure that the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which he thus attempts to palliate, are &s;trictly natural, and do not &s;pring either from the neglect of education or the crime of &s;elf-indulgence.</P>
<P>Of our infancy, properly &s;o called, we either remember nothing, or few things faintly and imperfectly; &s;ome pa&s;&s;ions however make their appearance in this &s;tage of human life, and appear to be born with us, others are born after us; &s;ome follow us to the grave, others for&s;ake us in the decline of age.</P>
<P>The life of man is to be reviewed under three periods, infancy, youth, and manhood; the fir&s;t includes that portion of time before rea&s;on &s;hews it&s;elf; in the &s;econd it appears indeed, but being incompetent to the proper government of the creature, requires the aid,
<PB N="71" REF="78">
&s;upport and correction of education; in the third it attains to its maturity.</P>
<P>Now as a per&s;on's re&s;pon&s;ibility bears re&s;pect to his rea&s;on, &s;o do human puni&s;hments bear re&s;pect to his re&s;pon&s;ibility: Infants and boys are cha&s;ti&s;ed by the hand of the parent or the ma&s;ter; rational adults are amenable to the laws, and what is termed mi&s;chief in the fir&s;t ca&s;e becomes a crime in the other. It will not avail the man to plead lo&s;s of rea&s;on by temporary intoxication, nor can he excu&s;e him|&s;elf by the plea of any &s;udden impul&s;e of pa&s;|&s;ion. If a pri&s;oner tells his judge that it is his nature to be cruel, that anger, lu&s;t or malice are inherent in his con&s;titution, no human tri|bunal will admit the defence; yet thus it is that all people deal with God and the world, when they attempt to palliate their enormities, by pleading the uncontroulable propen&s;ity of their natural de&s;ires, as if the Creator had &s;et up a tyrant in their hearts, which they were nece&s;&s;i|tated to obey.</P>
<P>This mi&s;erable &s;ubterfuge is no le&s;s abject than impious; for what can be more degrading to a being, who&s;e inherent attribute is free-agency and who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing faculty is rea|&s;on, than to &s;helter him&s;elf from the dread of re&s;pon&s;ibility under the humiliating apology of

<P>The pa&s;&s;ion of fear &s;eems coaeval with our nature; if they, who have our infancy in charge, &s;uffer this pa&s;&s;ion to fix and increa&s;e upon us; if they augment our infant fears by invented terrors, and pre&s;ent to our &s;ight frightful objects to &s;care us; if they practi&s;e on our natural and defencele&s;s timidity by blows and menaces, and cru&s;h us into ab&s;olute &s;ubjection of &s;pirit
<PB N="73" REF="80">
in our early years, a human creature thus abu&s;ed has enough to plead in excu&s;e for cow|ardice; and yet this, which is the &s;tronge&s;t defence we can make upon the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, is perhaps the only one we never re&s;ort to: In mo&s;t other pa&s;&s;ions we call that con&s;ti|tution, which is only habit.</P>
<P>When we reflect upon the variety of pa&s;&s;ions, to which the human mind is liable, it &s;hould &s;eem as if rea&s;on, which is expre&s;sly implanted in us for their correction and controul, was greatly overmatched by &s;uch a ho&s;t of turbulent in&s;urgents; but upon a clo&s;er examination we may find that rea&s;on has many aids and allies, and though her antagoni&s;ts are al&s;o many and mighty, yet that they are divided and di&s;tracted, whil&s;t &s;he can in all ca&s;es turn one pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t another, &s;o as to counterbalance any power by its oppo&s;ite, and make evil in&s;tru|ments in her hands conducive to moral ends: Avarice for in&s;tance will act as a counterpoi&s;e to lu&s;t and intemperance, whil&s;t vanity on the other hand will check avarice; fear will keep a bad man hone&s;t, and pride will &s;ometimes make a coward brave.</P>

ca&s;e, when the provocation thereunto &s;prings from jokes of a man's own making; but there was this peculiarity in <HI>Mr. Chatter</HI>'s di&s;ea&s;e, that he would laugh where no je&s;t was, or even at the je&s;ts of other people, rather than not laugh at all. I &s;oon perceived this to be oc|ca&s;ioned by exceedingly weak intellects, and an even row of very white teeth. As his malady would not yield to the ordinary pre&s;criptions, I was forced to throw him into a regimen of <HI>&s;kating,</HI> for which the &s;ea&s;on was then fa|vourable: The operation &s;ucceeded to my warm|e&s;t wi&s;hes, and the patient was effectually &s;ilenced by a happy di&s;location of two of his fore-teeth from a fall on the ice.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Kitty Scandal</HI> was put into my hands by her acquaintance in a very deplorable con|dition; it was the <HI>Caco&euml;thes defamationis &s;ca|bio&s;um:</HI> The common antidotes had no effect upon her; I admini&s;tered <HI>detergents</HI> out of Mi&s;s Carter's Epictetus and Mrs. Chapone's Letters, but the do&s;e would not &s;tay upon her &s;tomach; I tried the <HI>Pythagorean pill,</HI> but with no better &s;ucce&s;s.

<P><HI>Tom Belfry</HI> was the nui&s;ance of &s;ociety; he applied to me when he was far gone indeed; he had been black-balled by half the clubs in town, and <HI>&s;ent to Coventry</HI> by the other half. I examined his ca&s;e, and found it under the fol|lowing cla&s;s&mdash;<HI>Vox &s;tentoria, &s;empiterna, cum ce|rebello vacuo, necnon auribus obtu&s;is admod&ugrave;m ac inertibus.</HI>&mdash;As his organs of &s;peech &s;eemed in want of immediate modulation, I tried the pitch|pipe upon him repeatedly, but the vehemence of his complaint baffled all my efforts; I could never bring him down within a full octave of &s;ound health. I was unwilling to proceed to extremities, till I had done all that my more regular practice could &s;ugge&s;t for his relief; but when I found none but de&s;perate remedies could &s;ave him, I cau&s;ed a vein to be opened in his right arm, and drew out fourteen ounces of blood: This was in the month of March la&s;t, and the wind was then in the ea&s;t with &s;leet and rain: I immediately ordered the patient to take boat at Black-friars, and be rowed to Chel&s;ea-Reach and back again in an open wherry: The expected con&s;equence en&s;ued; a total deprivation of voice took place, and <HI>Mr. Belfry,</HI> being no longer able to articulate, is

<P><HI>Captain Swagger</HI> was continually talking of battles, and fieges, and campaigns, though he had never &s;een either: He arraigned the con|duct of every enterprize; and proved to de|mon&s;tration, by the force of oaths, how much better it would have been managed, had he been the commander: The &s;ymptoms were too apparent to be mi&s;taken&mdash;<HI>Os grandiloquum, ro|tundum, cum dextr&acirc; bello frigid&acirc;.</HI>&mdash;In this &s;tate of his di&s;order he was recommended to my care by the officers of his me&s;s. I found the tumefaction &s;o vehement, that I pre&s;cribed an

opening by inci&s;ion. The captain was ac|cordingly &s;ent out by his commanding officer upon a &s;couting-party, and &s;uffered a &s;urprize, which effectually repelled the tumefaction: <HI>Mr. Swagger</HI> threw up his commi&s;&s;ion, and has been a very &s;ilent member of the civil community ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent you the&s;e ca&s;es out of many, as being peculiar; in common ca&s;es, the general method I take to bring any gentleman to a pa|tient hearing, is to entertain him with his own commendations: If this &s;imple medicine will not &s;erve, I am forced to da&s;h it with a few drops of &s;lander, which is the be&s;t appea&s;er I know; for many of my patients will li&s;ten to that, when nothing el&s;e can &s;ilence them. This recipe however is not palatable, nor ought it to be u&s;ed but with caution and di&s;cretion; I keep it therefore in re&s;erve like laudanum for &s;pecial occa&s;ions. When a patient is far ad|vanced towards his cure, I take him with me to the gallery of the Hou&s;e of Commons, when certain orators, whom I have in my eye, are upon their legs to harangue; and I have always found if a convale&s;cent can hear that, he can hear any thing.</P>

forwardne&s;s, which this practice of our's is &s;ure to create, pa&s;&s;es off agreeably for a time; but, when infancy cea&s;es, it begins to annoy us, and Mi&s;s or Ma&s;ter appear in&s;upportably pert. The parent then finds him&s;elf obliged to turn the other &s;ide of his countenance upon the wit|tici&s;ms of his child; this is not only a painful ta&s;k, but probably a fruitle&s;s one; for the child by this time has made its party, and can find its admirers el&s;ewhere: Every obliging vi&s;itor makes intere&s;t with the clever little creature; the nur&s;ery, the kitchen, the &s;tables echo with applau&s;e; it can chatter, or mimic, or act its tricks before the &s;ervants, and be &s;ure of an audience: The mi&s;chief is done, and the parent may &s;nub to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Let parents therefore fir&s;t correct them&s;elves, before they undertake that office for their chil|dren: Education is incompatible with &s;elf-indul|gence, and the impul&s;e of vanity is too often mi&s;taken for the impul&s;e of nature: When Mi&s;s is a wit, I am apt to &s;u&s;pect that her mother is not over-wi&s;e.</P>

&s;he was thinking of &s;omething el&s;e, and the &s;tory I &s;hould gue&s;s had been very circum&s;tan|tial; &s;o that I heartily forgave her.

<P>As for the &s;tory, which now followed, there is no occa&s;ion to repeat it; if it had made its entrance without a herald; if it had grown out of the conver&s;ation naturally, and not been grafted in again&s;t nature; and if it had been le&s;s prolix, or told with more point, the &s;tory had not been ami&s;s; it was a good one in its own country, but it was lamed in its journey, and Vane&s;&s;a did not &s;eem exactly to know when it was fini&s;hed, until the relater made a &s;econd apo&s;trophe, hoping he had now repaired all former damages, and rein&s;tated the ladies in their u&s;ual good &s;pirits.

On the day appointed, Jupiter, in the per&s;on of an elderly Athenian gentleman, and Apollo as his &s;on, pre&s;ented

them&s;elves in the great &s;aloon of the palace: Midas, &s;urrounded by his courtiers, and glit|tering in his riche&s;t robes, received the gods habited in this &s;imple attire, and unattended. The injunctions of Mercury were neglected, for the fea&s;t was the mo&s;t &s;umptuous that art and luxury could devi&s;e; and the gods were di&s;gu&s;ted with the vanity of their ho&s;t, and the profu&s;ion of his entertainment. When Midas had thus contrived to di&s;play the wealth and &s;plendor of his court to his cele&s;tial gue&s;ts, his next &s;tudy was to impre&s;s them with an opinion of his talents and accom|pli&s;hments: He di&s;cour&s;ed to Jupiter, without cea&s;ing, upon his maxims and rules of govern|ment; he treated him with innumerable anec|dotes and events, calculated to &s;et off his own wi&s;dom, con&s;equence, and good policy, and of every tale he made him&s;elf the hero. The courtiers kept &s;ilence through fear, the deities through contempt; no voice was heard but the voice of Midas. He had not the &s;en&s;e to di&s;cern the impropriety of his being an in|ce&s;&s;ant talker, when he ought only to have been a re&s;pectful hearer; and &s;o con&s;ummate was his vanity, that having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Jupiter with impre&s;&s;ions, as he fooli&s;hly imagined, of his wi&s;dom and &s;cience, he flattered him&s;elf

nothing was wanting but to recommend him|&s;elf to Apollo by a &s;pecimen of his accom|pli&s;hments in mu&s;ic and poetry.

<P>At Warblington, near Havant in Hamp|&s;hire, within &s;ix miles of Port&s;mouth, in the par&s;onage hou&s;e dwelt Thomas Perce the tenant, with his wife and a child, a man-&s;er|vant
<PB N="95" REF="102">
Thomas . . . . and a maid-&s;ervant. About the beginning of Augu&s;t, Anno 1695, on a Monday, about nine or ten at night, all being gone to bed, except the maid with the child, the maid being in the kitchen, and having raked up the fire, took a candle in one hand, and the child in the other arm, and turning about &s;aw one in a black gown walking through the room, and thence out of the door into the orchard: Upon this the maid, ha&s;ting up &s;tairs, having recovered but two &s;teps, cried out; on which the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s ran down, found the candle in her hand, &s;he gra&s;ping the child about its neck with the other arm: She told them the rea&s;on of her crying out; &s;he would not that night tarry in the hou&s;e, but removed to another belonging to one Henry Salter, far|mer; where &s;he cried out all the night from the terror &s;he was in, and &s;he could not be per&s;uaded to go any more to the hou&s;e upon any terms.</P>
<P>On the morrow, (i. e. Tue&s;day) the tenant's wife came to me, lodging then at Havant, to de&s;ire my advice, and have con|&s;ult with &s;ome friends about it; I told her I thought it was a flam, and that they had a mind to abu&s;e Mr. Brereton the Rector,
<PB N="96" REF="103">
who&s;e hou&s;e it was; &s;he de&s;ired me to come up; I told her I would come up and &s;it up or lie there, as &s;he plea&s;ed; for then as to all &s;tories of gho&s;ts and apparitions I was an in|fidel: I went thither and &s;ate up the Tue&s;day night with the tenant and his man-&s;ervant: About twelve or one o'clock I &s;earched all the rooms in the hou&s;e to &s;ee if any body were hid there to impo&s;e upon me: At la&s;t we came into a lumber-room, there I &s;miling told the tenant that was with me, that I would call for the apparition, if there was any, and oblige him to come: The tenant then &s;eemed to be afraid, but I told him I would defend him from harm! and then I repeated <HI>Barbara, celarent Darii,</HI> &amp;c. je&s;tingly; on this the tenant's countenance changed, &s;o that he was ready to drop down with fear: Then I told him I perceived he was afraid, and I would prevent its coming, and repeated <HI>Ba|ralipton,</HI> &amp;c. then he recovered his &s;pirits pretty well and we left the room and went down into the kitchen, where we were before, and &s;ate up there the remaining part of the night and had no manner of di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day night the tenant and I lay toge|ther in one room and the man in another room, and he &s;aw &s;omething walk along in a
<PB N="97" REF="104">
black gown and place it&s;elf again&s;t a window, and there &s;tood for &s;ome time, and then walked off. Friday morning the man re|lating this, I a&s;ked him why he did not call me, and I told him I thought that was a trick or flam; he told me the rea&s;on why he did not call me was, that he was not able to &s;peak or move. Friday night we lay as be|fore, and Saturday night, and had no di&s;turb|ance either of the nights.</P>
<P>Sunday night I lay by my&s;elf in one room (not that where the man &s;aw the apparition) and the tenant and his man in one bed in another room; and betwixt twelve and two the man heard &s;omething walk in their room at the bed's foot, and whi&s;tling very well; at la&s;t it came to the bed's &s;ide, drew the cur|tain and looked on them; after &s;ome time it moved off; then the man called to me, de&s;ir|ed me to come, for that there was &s;ome|thing in the room went about whi&s;tling: I a&s;ked him whether he had any light or could &s;trike one, he told me no; then I leapt out of bed, and, not &s;taying to put on my clothes, went out of my room and along a gallery to the door, which I found locked or bolted; I de&s;ired him to unlock the door, for that I could not get in; then he got out
<PB N="98" REF="105">
of bed and opened the door, which was near, and went immediately to bed again; I went in three or four &s;teps, and, it being a moon|&s;hine night, I &s;aw the apparition move from the bed &s;ide, and clap up again&s;t the wall that divided their room and mine: I went and &s;tood directly again&s;t it within my arm's length of it, and a&s;ked it in the name of God what it was, that made it come di&s;turbing of us; I &s;tood &s;ome time expecting an an&s;wer, and receiving none, and thinking it might be &s;ome fellow hid in the room to fright me, <HI>I put out my arm to feel it, and my hand &s;eemingly went through the body of it, and felt no manner of &s;ub&s;tance, till it came to the wall; then I drew back my hand, and &s;till it was in the &s;ame place:</HI> Till now I had not the lea&s;t fear, and even now had very little; then I adjured it to tell me what it was: When I had &s;aid tho&s;e words, it, keeping its back again&s;t the wall, moved gently along towards the door: I followed it, and it, going out at the door, turned its back toward me: It went a little along the gallery; I followed it a little into the gallery, and it di&s;appeared, where there was no corner for it to turn, and before it came to the end of the gallery, where was the &s;tairs. Then I found my&s;elf very cold
<PB N="99" REF="106">
from my feet as high as my middle, though I was not in great fear; I went into the bed betwixt the tenant and his man, and they complained of my being exceeding cold. The tenant's man leaned over his ma&s;ter in the bed, and &s;aw me &s;tretch out my hand towards the apparition, and heard me &s;peak the words; the tenant al&s;o heard the words. The apparition &s;eemed to have a morning gown of a darki&s;h colour, no hat nor cap, &s;hort black hair, a thin meagre vi&s;age of a pale &s;warthy colour, &s;eemed to be of about forty-five or fifty years old; the eyes half &s;hut, the arms hanging down; the hands vi&s;ible beneath the &s;leeve; of a middle &s;tature. I related this de&s;cription to Mr. John Lardner, rector of Havant, and to Major Battin of Lang&s;tone in Havant pari&s;h; they both &s;aid the de&s;cription agreed very well to Mr. P. a former rector of the place, who has been dead above twenty years: Upon this the tenant and his wife left the hou&s;e, which has remained void &s;ince.</P>
<P>The Monday after la&s;t Michaelmas-day, a man of Chod&s;on in Warwick&s;hire having been at Havant fair, pa&s;&s;ed by the fore&s;aid par&s;onage-hou&s;e about nine or ten at night, and &s;aw a light in mo&s;t of the rooms of the hou&s;e; his

pathway being clo&s;e by the hou&s;e, he, won|dering at the light, looked into the kitchen window, and &s;aw only a light, but turning him&s;elf to go away, he &s;aw the appearance of a man in a long gown; he made ha&s;te away; the apparition followed him over a piece of glebe land of &s;everal acres, to a lane, which he cro&s;&s;ed, and over a little meadow, then over another lane to &s;ome pales, which belong to farmer Henry Salter my landlord, near a barn, in which were &s;ome of the farmer's men and &s;ome others; this man went into the barn, told them how he was frighted and followed from the par&s;onage-hou&s;e by an apparition, which they might &s;ee &s;tanding again&s;t the pales, if they went out; they went out, and &s;aw it &s;cratch again&s;t the pales, and make a hideous noi&s;e; it &s;tood there &s;ome time and then di&s;appeared; their de&s;cription agreed with what I &s;aw.

<P>I SHALL now proceed to lay before the public, &s;uch an account as I have been enabled to collect of the &s;everal Greek writers of comedy.</P>
<P>The learned reader needs not to be informed, how little is to be found in Ari&s;totle's Poetics on the &s;ubject of comedy; that treati&s;e by no means an&s;wers to the general profe&s;&s;ion of its title; if it had come down to us as perfect and entire, as it probably was when the author put the la&s;t hand to it, and pre&s;ented a correct copy of his work to Alexander, we might conclude otherwi&s;e of it; but to &s;peak of it as it is, we can call it nothing more than a di&s;&s;ertation upon tragedy, in which many things are evidently out of place and order, &s;ome no doubt lo&s;t, and others mutilated: It is thus con&s;idered by the learned commentator Daniel Hein&s;ius, who in his &s;upplementary treati&s;e annexed to his edi|tion,
<PB N="102" REF="109">
profe&s;&s;edly &s;peaks only of the con&s;truction of tragedy, and endeavours with great diligence and per&s;picuity to methodize the whole work, and di&s;po&s;e his author's &s;y&s;tem into &s;ome order and regularity.</P>
<P>With the exception of a few obvious re|marks upon the epic, as tending to illu&s;trate the drama, and two or three pa&s;&s;ages where comedy is &s;poken of only as contra&s;ted with tragedy, the whole of this celebrated di&s;&s;ertation is nothing more than a &s;et of rules for the drama, which are mere tran&s;cripts from the compo&s;itions of the great writers of the Ho|meric tragedy, Ae&s;chylus, Sophocles, and Euri|pides: He analyzes and defines a poem, then actually carried to its perfection; but gives no new lights, no leading in&s;tructions, for the fur|therance and improvement of what had not ar|rived to the like &s;tate of maturity.</P>
<P>With the remains of the three tragic poets above mentioned in our hands, I profe&s;s I do not &s;ee how we are edified by Ari&s;totle's di&s;&s;er|tation, which offers nothing but what occurs upon the reading of their dramas; unle&s;s po&s;te|rity had &s;een fit to abide by the &s;ame laws, which they ob&s;erved, and the modern tragedy had been made exactly to conform to the Greek model.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="110">Ari&s;totle, as we have before remarked, &s;peaks of no comedy antecedent to the comedy of Epi|charmus: There is rea&s;on to think that this author did not fall in with the per&s;onal comedy in the licentious manner it prevailed upon the Athenian &s;tage, even to the time of Ari&s;totle; for it was not reformed there, till the per&s;onal &s;atiri&s;ts were awed into better re&s;pect by the Ma|cedonian princes, who &s;ucceeded to Alexander; whereas Epicharmus wrote for the court of an ab&s;olute prince.</P>
<P>Now it is remarkable, that Ari&s;totle makes no &s;trictures upon the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Athe|nian comedy, nor offers any rules for the cor|rection of the &s;tage, though the &s;chools pro|&s;cribed it, and the tribunals were at open ho&s;ti|lity with it. It is plain he &s;tates things as they were, not as they ought to have been; for he pronounces of comedy&mdash;<HI>that it is a picture of human nature, wor&s;e and more deformed than the original.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot hold this to be a ju&s;t character of comedy, as it &s;tood at the time when Ari&s;totle pronounced it: The only entire comedies we have to refer to, are a contradiction to the a&s;|&s;ertion; for no one will contend that the cor|rupt and abominable manners of the times in which Ari&s;tophanes wrote, did not fully warrant
<PB N="104" REF="111">
the &s;everity of his &s;atire, or that his characters of depravity are in general overcharged, <HI>and his pictures of human nature more deformed than their originals.</HI> As for the re&s;t of the comic fraternity, their fragments only can plead for them; but they are fragments of &s;uch a nature, as prove them to have been morali&s;ts of the &s;ublime&s;t &s;ort, and they have been collected, tran&s;lated, and applauded, by the grave&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ententious of the Chri&s;tian writers for many ages. I will venture to &s;ay, that in the&s;e &s;cattered reliques of the comic &s;tage, more u&s;eful knowledge and good &s;en&s;e, better maxims for right conduct in life, and a more generous di&s;play of benevolence, ju&s;tice, public &s;pirit, and all the moral virtues of natural religion are to be found, than in all the writings of the philo&s;ophers, which are &s;o much more entire.</P>
<P>Socrates, it is true, could hardly be prevailed upon to enter the comic theatre, but I infer very little again&s;t the poets on that account; Plato, I am aware, though an intimate of Ari&s;tophanes, bani&s;hed the drama out of his vi&s;ionary republic; but what is that more than to &s;ay, that if all men were virtuous there would be no need of &s;atiri&s;ts? The comic poets in return la&s;hed the philo&s;ophers over the &s;tage, and they had what they merited, the
<PB N="105" REF="112">
public applau&s;e on their &s;ide; the &s;chools and academies of &s;ophi&s;ts furni&s;hed an inexhau&s;tible fund for whole&s;ome ridicule; their contradictory fir&s;t principles, their daemons and clouds, and water and fire, with all their idle &s;y&s;tems and hypothe&s;es, their fabulous conceits, dreams and devices to catch the vulgar, and the affected rigour of their manners, whil&s;t in &s;ecret they were addicted to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t debauchery and impurity, were continual &s;ubjects of &s;atire; and if hypocri&s;y is not the comic poet's lawful game, what is? There is not a play of Ari|&s;tophanes to be named, in which the&s;e &s;anctified &s;inners have not their &s;hare in the ridicule; and among&s;t the fragments above mentioned, a very large proportion falls to their lot.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle, who had very little feeling for Plato and his academy, or indeed for practical philo&s;ophy in general (which he &s;eems to have profe&s;&s;ed only in oppo&s;ition to Xenocrates) con|cerned him&s;elf no further about the &s;tate of the &s;tage, than to comment and remark upon the tragedies of the three chief writers above mentioned; and it is humiliating enough to the pride of critici&s;m to ob&s;erve, that tragedy, after all his pains to hold it up to the &s;tandard of Sophocles and Euripides, &s;unk with tho&s;e au|thors, and was no more heard of; whil&s;t co|medy,

<P>I have &s;poken of tragedy as a <HI>written poem</HI> before comedy of the &s;ame de&s;cription, becau&s;e I think that Su&s;arion did not <HI>write</HI> comedy, though he acted it &s;o early as the fiftieth Olym|piad; and I al&s;o think that The&s;pis did <HI>write</HI> tragedy in the &s;ixty-fir&s;t Olympiad, if not &s;ooner; in other words, although the com|plexion of the original drama was comic in the mo&s;t extravagant degree, yet it appears pro|bable that tragedy had the &s;tart in point of pub|lication. The nature of the fir&s;t comedy, compared with that of the fir&s;t tragedy, &s;eems to warrant this opinion; for it is ea&s;y to &s;up|po&s;e that the raillery and &s;atire of the village ma&s;ques, which would pa&s;s off at a lawle&s;s fe&s;tival, &s;poken off-hand and without the malice of premeditation, would not &s;o readily have been committed to writing by the poet, as the tragic drama; which being compo&s;ed in honour of decea&s;ed heroes, or on religious and grave &s;ubjects, not only called for greater deliberation on the part of the author, but would al&s;o be made public without danger or offence.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="114">It now remains to enquire into the chronology of the <HI>written</HI> comedy.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that Ari&s;totle a&s;|cribes the fir&s;t written comedy to Epichar|mus.</P>
<P>Both Ari&s;totle and Horace call him a <HI>Sicilian,</HI> but in what particular place he was born is not agreed; &s;ome contend that he was a Syracu&s;an, &s;ome that he was a native of Cra&s;tum, others of Megara in Sicily: Diomedes the gramma|rian &s;ays he was born in Cos, and derives the word comedy from the name of that i&s;land, a derivation that &s;ets a&s;ide his authority altoge|ther. The father of Epicharmus was named Chimarus, or according to others Tityrus, and his mother Sicida. Cicero in his Tu&s;culans calls him, <HI>acutum nec in&s;ul&s;um hominem:</HI> Deme|trius Phaleraeus celebrates him for the elegant and appo&s;ite choice of his epithets, on which account the Greeks gave the name of <HI>Epichar|mion</HI> to his &s;tile, making it proverbial for its beauty and purity. It is difficult to fix the preci&s;e time when he began to write comedy, e&s;pecially as he lived to the great age of ninety-&s;even: It is certain however he was &s;till writing in the reign of Hiero, in or about Olymp. LXXIV. at which time Phormis al&s;o wrote comedy in Sicily; and Chionides, Dinolo|chus
<PB N="108" REF="115">
and Magnes, comic poets, flouri&s;hed at Athens.</P>
<P>Suidas's chronology does not agree with Ari&s;totle's, for he makes Chionides antecedent to Epicharmus, and calls him the fir&s;t writer of comedy; adding, that Evetes, Euxenides and Mylus, all Athenians, were his contempo|raries; he allows, however, that Epicharmus and Phormis were the fir&s;t writers in the i&s;land of Sicily; but this is in the vague manner of his dates, and not to be relied upon: He takes no notice of Ari&s;totle's expre&s;s a&s;&s;ertion, that Epicharmus was long &s;enior to Chionides; and yet he might have recollected, that facts are &s;o far in favour of Ari&s;totle's chronology of the&s;e poets, that there is a title upon record of one of Chionides's plays called <HI>The Per&s;ians,</HI> which mu&s;t have been po&s;terior to the Per&s;ian aera, when it is on all hands agreed that Epicharmus was living.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the epigrams of Theocritus, pub|li&s;hed by Henry Stevens in 1579, there are &s;ome lines upon Epicharmus, which appear to have been in&s;cribed upon the pede&s;tal of a &s;tatue of bra&s;s, which the Syracu&s;ans had &s;et up in his honour as their fellow-citizen: It con&s;i&s;ts of ten lines in the Doric dialect, which he u&s;ed; it &s;ettles the point of his birth, expre&s;sly

<Q>Epicharmus, the man who invented Comedy.</Q> In the conclu&s;ion, it celebrates him for the many u&s;eful maxims which he gave for the in|&s;truction of youth; but this I am di&s;po&s;ed to think may apply to the circum&s;tance of his having been a &s;choolma&s;ter at Syracu&s;e; for if we are to take our judgment of Epicharmus's drama from his imitator Plautus, perhaps its morality, though not to be overlooked among&s;t other excellencies, is neverthele&s;s not the mo&s;t &s;triking feature in its character. And though it is probable that Epicharmus did not launch out into that per&s;onality, which the freer Athenians indulged to &s;uch exce&s;s, yet I can &s;uppo&s;e him to have been not very cha&s;te in his dialogue, from the anecdote which Plutarch gives us, of his being heavily fined and com|pelled to manual labour by order of Hiero for certain ob&s;cene je&s;ts, which he &s;uffered to pa&s;s in hearing of his queen: I mu&s;t ground another remark upon this anecdote, re&s;pecting the time in which he is generally thought to have &s;truck
<PB N="110" REF="117">
out his comedy, as being long antecedent to the time of Hiero; which being admitted, it will follow that he was near the clo&s;e of his life, when this &s;entence of manual labour was exe|cuted upon him; a kind of puni&s;hment &s;o very unlikely to be inflicted on a man of ninety-&s;ix years by a prince of Hiero's magnanimity and benevolence, that if I am to take the anecdote for granted, I cannot a&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e authorities that have placed him &s;o high in time, for the purpo&s;e only of putting his title of fir&s;t founder of comedy out of di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I think it likely the Athe|nians wrote comedy as &s;oon as the Sicilians, but that Epicharmus was the fir&s;t, who formed his drama upon the poems of Homer: It is al&s;o clear, that his countryman and contempo|rary Phormis wrote comedy as &s;oon, or nearly as &s;oon as he did; for although Theocritus, in the epigram above cited, &s;ays expre&s;sly that Epicharmus &s;truck out comedy, yet it mu&s;t be remarked that Theocritus was a Syracu&s;an by birth, living in the time of Ptolemy Lagus; and in giving this te&s;timony for his fellow-citizen, it is more than probable he &s;poke lo|cally of the <HI>Sicilian</HI> comedy only, as Suidas did in after times, when he &s;aid that Epichar|mus
<PB N="111" REF="118">
and Phormis fir&s;t &s;truck out comedy <HI>in Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>I would therefore fix Epicharmus's fir&s;t co|medy antecedent to Olymp. LXXV. at the lowe&s;t date, becau&s;e we have it from good authority that he was teaching &s;cholars at Sy|racu&s;e four years before the Per&s;ian aera; and this date is confirmed by the age of Phormis, who certainly flouri&s;hed in the time of Gelon, and was in great favour in the court of that prince, who was predece&s;&s;or to Hiero, and was &s;ucceeded by him in Olymp.

<P>The &s;ame re&s;pect, which led me to in&s;ert the&s;e titles, led me al&s;o to &s;earch with all po&s;&s;ible di|ligence for every fragment which I could find of Epicharmus. I wi&s;h they had been more in number, and of greater importance than they are; but &s;uch as they are, I have rea&s;on to believe they are the whole amount of what can be picked up from the wreck of this once valu|able poet. The reader mu&s;t not expect, that either in this author's in&s;tance, or that of any other Greek comedian, except in very few ca&s;es, that the particular play can be a&s;certained, to which the fragments belong; for the gramma|rians and others, who quote them, only give the name of the author, and not that of the co|medy from which they extract them. I mu&s;t in this place once for all give vent to an anxiety, which pre&s;&s;es on my mind re&s;pecting the&s;e frag|ments of the Greek comedy, whether the in|&s;ertion of them will or will not be approved of by the generality of my readers: My &s;ole ob|ject is to furni&s;h them with rational and moral amu&s;ement, and if I fail of that object in the&s;e my hearty endeavours, I have taken a great deal of pains to render the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages into

Engli&s;h in the be&s;t manner my capacity enabled me to do, to a very unfortunate purpo&s;e indeed.

I have &s;tudied &s;o to cla&s;s them, as not to burthen or di&s;tract the reader with a mere &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mi&s;cellaneous quotations without any reference or connection, which I am &s;en&s;ible could not be an agreeable mode of publication, though Stobaeus, Hertelius and &s;ome others have taken it up; but on the contrary, I have endeavoured to introduce them with &s;ome anec|dote or other, which &s;erves to weave them into the thread of the work. Mo&s;t of the tran&s;la|tions will be found in metre, in which I have &s;trove to copy the free &s;tile of our old metrical comic poets: Some I have turned into rhime, where the thought allowed it, and the expre&s;&s;ions were ter&s;e and epigrammatical: Others I have put into pro&s;e; and in all I have been as clo&s;e and faithful to the original, as the language and my con&s;truction of the author would per|mit.

<P><HI>Cratinus</HI> was the &s;on of Callimedes an Athe|nian; we have the titles of at lea&s;t thirty co|medies of his writing, &s;o that Suidas is mi&s;taken in a&s;cribing to him only twenty-one; he was a poet of &s;trong imagination, and a florid lively &s;tile; he carried away no le&s;s than nine prizes, which is a large proportion of &s;ucce&s;s, com|pared with others, who rank among&s;t the highe&s;t both in the comic and tragic line. A &s;econd edict came out in his time for re&s;training the
<PB N="123" REF="132">
licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;tage in point of per&s;ona|lity, and Cratinus, in common with the re&s;t of his contemporaries, found him&s;elf obliged to divert his &s;atire from the living to the dead: Sarca&s;ms were now levelled at men's productions, not at their per&s;ons; the tragic authors felt the chief weight of the attack, though even Homer did not e&s;cape, as may be gathered from <HI>The Uly&s;&s;es</HI> of Cratinus, in which he parodies and ridicules the Ody&s;&s;ey.</P>
<P>Cratinus lived to an extreme old age, though according to the loo&s;e morals of the Greeks he indulged his pa&s;&s;ions both natural and un|natural without re&s;traint: He carried his love of wine to &s;uch exce&s;s, that he got the name of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, launching out in prai&s;e of drinking, and rallying all &s;obriety out of countenance, a&s;&s;erting that no author can be good for any thing, who does not love his bottle, and that dramatic poets in particular ought to drink hard, as a duty due to Bacchus for his peculiar patronage and protection of the &s;tage. Horace, who was not very aver&s;e from his doctrine, quotes his authority in the fir&s;t lines of an epi&s;tle to Mecaenas.</P>
<Q><L>Pri&s;co &s;i credis, Mecaenas docte, Cratino,</L>

<L>Which coldly flows from water-drinker's brain.</L></Q>
<P>As for the love of wine, it &s;eems to have &s;tood in the place of a merit with the Greeks; but Cratinus's exce&s;s was attended in his old age with &s;ome marks of weakne&s;s and want of re|tention, incidental to an exhau&s;ted con&s;titution, which gave a handle to Ari&s;tophanes, who was a younger man (and not much more ab&s;te|mious) to bring his old competitor on the &s;tage, and hold him up to ridicule for this infirmity. The charge was unmanly, and rou&s;ed the aged veteran to return the attack: Cra|tinus, then nearly approaching to an hundred, had left off writing, but he was not yet &s;uper|annuated, and lived to compleat a comedy, which he appo&s;itely entitled <HI>The Flaggon.</HI> In the plot of this piece he feigns him&s;elf married to Comedy, whom he per&s;onifies, and repre&s;ents the lady in di&s;gu&s;t with her hu&s;band for his unconjugal neglect, on which account &s;he &s;tates her charge, and roundly &s;ues for an actual divorce: Upon this hearing, certain friends and advocates are introduced on the &s;cene in be|half of the party accu&s;ed, who make &s;uit to the dame to &s;tay her proceedings, and not be over|ha&s;ty

<P><HI>Eupolis</HI> became a very popular author &s;ome years before the death of Cratinus: The bold &s;trong &s;pirit of his &s;atire recommended him to the public more than the beauties and graces of his &s;tile, which he was not &s;tudious to poli&s;h. He attacked the mo&s;t obnoxious and profligate characters in Athens, without any re|gard to his per&s;onal &s;afety; to expo&s;e the cheat, and ridicule the impo&s;tor was the glory of his mu&s;e, and neither the terrors of the magi&s;tracy, nor the my&s;teries of &s;uper&s;tition

could divert him from it. He wrote two co|medies profe&s;&s;edly again&s;t Autolycus the Areo|pagite, who&s;e mi&s;behaviour in the Chaeronen|&s;ian war had made him infamous, and he called them after his name <HI>The fir&s;t and &s;econd Autolycus.</HI> In his famous comedy called <HI>The Baptae</HI> he in|veighs again&s;t the effeminate turpitude of his countrymen, whom he exhibits dancing after the manner of the la&s;civious prie&s;ts of Cotytto (viz. <HI>the Baptae</HI>) in the habits and fa&s;hion of female min&s;trels.</P>

<P>The prevailing account of his death is, that the per&s;ons, whom he had &s;atirized in this play of the <HI>Baptae,</HI> &s;uborned certain a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to throw him into the &s;ea, as he was pa&s;&s;ing the Helle&s;pont with the Athenian forces then on an expedition again&s;t the Lacedaemonians; and &s;everal autho|rities impute this revengeful deed to Alcibiades, who had been &s;everely handled in that piece; but Cicero in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle of the &s;ixth book to Atticus &s;peaks of this report as a vulgar error, and quotes Erato&s;thenes for the fact of Eupolis having written certain comedies after the time, when the event of his death is dated
<PB N="128" REF="137">&mdash;<HI>redarguit Erato&s;thenes; affert enim quas ille po&s;t id tempus fabulas docuerit.</HI></P>
<P>Pau&s;anias tells us, that his tomb was erected upon the banks of the Ae&s;opus in Sicyonia, and as it is not likely this honour &s;hould be paid to his memory by the Sicyonians, he being an Athenian born, unle&s;s he had died in their country; the authority of Pau&s;anias &s;eems to confirm the account of Erato&s;thenes, and di&s;|credit the fable of his being thrown into the Helle&s;pont.</P>
<P>In his comedy called <HI>The People,</HI> by the fiction of the &s;cene he rai&s;es the &s;hades of their departed orators and daemagogues from the dead; and when Pericles, la&s;t of the troop, ari&s;es, the poet demands,
<Q REND="inline">"Who it is that ap|pears?"</Q>
The que&s;tion being an&s;wered, and the &s;pirit of Pericles di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, he pronounces his encomium&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That he was pre-eminent as an orator, for man never &s;poke as he &s;poke: When he &s;tarted like a cour&s;er in the race, he threw all competitors out of &s;ight, &s;o rapid was the torrent of his eloquence; but with that rapidity there &s;lowed &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s and per&s;ua&s;ion from his lips, that He alone of all orators &s;truck a &s;ting into the very &s;ouls of his hearers, and left it there to remain for ever."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="138">I think it probable the following fragment has been the opening &s;peech of this very co|medy; for in it he addre&s;&s;es <HI>the People,</HI> and complains of the preference they are apt to be|&s;tow upon foreigners, to the neglect of their own countrymen&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Receiving every thing with favour that falls from their lips, and applauding them as oracles of human wi&s;|dom; whereas, if any one of your own countrymen addre&s;&s;es you (though in no re&s;pect their inferior) you look down upon him with contempt; nay, you are ready to pronounce that the man is in his dotage; a fool who never had &s;en&s;es, or a madman who has lo&s;t them&mdash;but hark ye, gentlemen! let me have a word with you at &s;tarting; let me prevail with you to revoke the&s;e un|ju&s;t proceedings, and give a fellow-citizen and your humble &s;ervant a fair hearing and impartial judgment."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pect this to be a fly blow at Ari&s;tophanes, who was not an Athenian born, and perhaps at this time had not his adoption. He proceeds to lament the &s;tate of public affairs, and the degeneracy of the times; for in the old co|medy it was u&s;ual for the poet to harangue the theatre, either in the opening of the piece, or at any convenient interval between the &s;cenes,

<P>THIS is an eulogy the more honourable to Ari&s;tophanes, as it fell from Plato, the di&s;ciple of Socrates. If I were to collect all the te&s;timonies, that are &s;cattered through the works of the learned in behalf of the author we are now about to review, I &s;hould fill my pages with panegyric; but this I am the le&s;s concerned to do, as the reader has a part of him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which as it is near a fourth of the whole man, he has more than the foot by which to mea&s;ure this Hercules.</P>
<P>Both the parentage and birth-place of Ari|&s;tophanes are doubtful: He was an adopted, not a natural, citizen of Athens, and I incline to think he was the &s;on of Philippus, a native
<PB N="136" REF="145">
of Aegina, where our poet had &s;ome patrimony. He was in per&s;on very tall, bony and robu&s;t, and we have his own authority for his baldne&s;s; but whether this was as di&s;graceful at Athens, as it was among&s;t the Romans, I have not been anxious to enquire. He was in private life of a free, open and companiable temper, and his company was &s;ought after by the greate&s;t characters of the age with all po&s;&s;ible avidity: Plato, and even Socrates, &s;hared many &s;ocial hours with him; he was much the mo&s;t popular character in Athens, as the great dae|magogue Cleon experienced to his co&s;t, not to mention Socrates him&s;elf: Every honour that could be paid to a poet was publicly be&s;towed upon Ari&s;tophanes by the Athenian people; nor did they confine their rewards to honorary prizes only, but decreed him fines and pecu|niary confi&s;cations from tho&s;e, who ventured to attack him with &s;uits and pro&s;ecutions: Diony&s;ius of Syracu&s;e in vain made overtures to him of the mo&s;t flattering &s;ort, at the time when Ae&s;chines and Ari&s;tippus, Socratic philo|&s;ophers, were retained in his court with &s;o much infamy to their private characters, and when even Plato him&s;elf had &s;olicited his notice by three &s;everal vi&s;its to Syracu&s;e, where he had not the good fortune to render him&s;elf

very agreeable. The fame of Ari&s;tophanes had reached to the court of Per&s;ia, and his prai&s;es were there &s;ounded by the great king him&s;elf, who con&s;idered him not only as the fir&s;t poet, but as the mo&s;t con&s;picuous per&s;onage at Athens. I do not find him marked with any other immorality, than that of intemperance with regard to wine, the fa&s;hionable exce&s;s of the time, and in &s;ome degree a kind of pre|rogative of his profe&s;&s;ion, a <HI>licentia poetica:</HI> Athenaeus the Deipno&s;ophi&s;t &s;ays he was drunk when he compo&s;ed, but this is a charge that will not pa&s;s upon any man who is &s;ober; and if we rejected it from Sophocles in the ca&s;e of Ae&s;chylus, we &s;hall not receive it but with contempt from &s;uch an accu&s;er as Athenaeus.

Amip|&s;ias and Ari&s;tonymus, both rival authors, charged him with availing him&s;elf of the talents of other people from con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own in&s;ufficiency: Their raillery could not draw him out, till his favourite actor Calli&s;tratus declined undertaking the part of Cleon in his per&s;onal comedy of <HI>The Knights,</HI> dreading the re&s;entment of that powerful daemagogue, who was as unforgiving as he was imperious: In this dilemma Ari&s;tophanes conquered his re|pugnance, and determined upon pre&s;enting him|&s;elf on the &s;tage for the fir&s;t time in his life: He dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the character of this for|midable tribune; and having coloured his face with vermilion up to the hue of the brutal per&s;on he was to re&s;emble, he entered on the part in &s;uch a &s;tile of energy, and with &s;uch natural expre&s;&s;ion, that the effect was irre&s;i&s;tible; and the proud factious Cleon was &s;tript of his popularity, and &s;entenced in a fine of five talents by the knight's decree, as damages for the
<PB N="139" REF="150">
charge he had preferred again&s;t the author touching his right of citizen&s;hip, which was awarded and &s;ecured to him by the &s;ame in&s;tru|ment.</P>
<P>Such was Ari&s;tophanes in per&s;on, manners and character: As a poet I might refer the learned reader to his works, which &s;peak &s;o ably for them&s;elves: They are not only valuable as his remains, but when we con&s;ider them as the only remains, which give us any complete &s;pe|cimens of the Greek comedy, they become ine&s;timable through the misfortunes of all the re&s;t. We receive them as trea&s;ures thrown up from a wreck, or more properly as one pa&s;&s;enger e&s;caped out of a fleet, who&s;e narrative we li&s;ten to with the more eagerne&s;s and curio&s;ity, be|cau&s;e it is from this alone we can gain intelli|gence of the nature of the expedition, the quality of the armament, and the characters and talents of the commanders, who have peri&s;hed and gone down into the aby&s;s together.</P>
<P>The comedies of Ari&s;tophanes are univer&s;ally e&s;teemed to be the &s;tandard of Attic writing in its greate&s;t purity; if any man would wi&s;h to know the language as it was &s;poken by Pericles, he mu&s;t &s;eek it in the &s;cenes of Ari&s;tophanes, where he is not u&s;ing a foreign or affected diction, for the purpo&s;e of accommodating it to
<PB N="140" REF="151">
&s;ome particular or extravagant character. The antient authors, both Greek and Roman, who had all the productions of the Athenian &s;tage before them, &s;peak of him with &s;uch rapture and admiration, as to give him a decided pre|ference before all other comic poets, with an exception as I believe of Plutarch only, who brings him into compari&s;on with Menander, and after di&s;cu&s;&s;ing their different preten&s;ions decides peremptorily for Menander: This cri|tici&s;m of Plutarch's I &s;hall re&s;erve for future con&s;ideration; and when I &s;aid that he is &s;ingle in his preference of Menander, perhaps I ought to recal the expre&s;&s;ion, as that poet has his ad|mirers, but none that I know of, who have de|liberately given judgment in his favour upon a critical compari&s;on with Ari&s;tophanes, except Plutarch above mentioned.</P>
<P>The drama of Ari&s;tophanes is of a mixed &s;pecies; &s;ometimes per&s;onal, at other times in|clining to parody, according to the character of the middle comedy: He varies and accommo|dates his &s;tile to his &s;ubject and the &s;peakers on the &s;cene; on &s;ome occa&s;ions it is elevated, grave, &s;ublime and poli&s;hed to a wonderful degree of brilliancy and beauty; on others it &s;inks and de&s;cends into humble dialogue, pro|vincial ru&s;ticity, coar&s;e naked ob&s;cenity, and
<PB N="141" REF="152">
even puns and quibbles: The ver&s;atility of his genius is admirable; for he gives us every rank and de&s;cription of men in his &s;cenes, and in every one is &s;trictly characteri&s;tic. In &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, and frequently in his choru&s;&s;es, he &s;tarts out of the ordinary province of comedy into the loftie&s;t flights of poetry, and in the&s;e I doubt if Ae&s;chylus or Pindar have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him: In &s;entiment and good &s;en&s;e he is not inferior to Euripides, and in the acutene&s;s of his critici&s;ms equalled by none: In the general purport of his moral he &s;eldom, if ever, fails; but he works occa&s;ionally with unclean tools, and, like Juvenal in the lower ages, cha&s;ti&s;es vice by an open expo&s;ure of its turpitude, offending the ear, whil&s;t he aims to mend the heart. This habit of plain &s;peaking was the fa&s;hion of the times he wrote in, and the au|dience demanded and would have it; that he may be &s;tudied by the pure&s;t readers we &s;hould conclude, when we are told he was the pillow companion of a Chri&s;tian &s;aint, as the well-known anecdote of Chry&s;o&s;tom will te&s;tify. If we cannot entirely defend the indelicacy of his mu&s;e, we cannot deny but that a great &s;hare of the blame re&s;ts with the &s;pectators: A dramatic poet cannot model his audience, but in a certain degree mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity con|form
<PB N="142" REF="153">
to their ta&s;te and humour: It can be proved that Ari&s;tophanes him&s;elf laments the hard ta&s;k impo&s;ed upon him of gratifying the public at the expence of decency; but with the example of the poet Cratinus before his eyes, who was driven from the &s;tage becau&s;e he &s;crupled to amu&s;e the public ear with tawdry je&s;ts, it is not to be wondered at, if an author, emulous of applau&s;e, &s;hould fall in with the wi&s;hes of the theatre, unbecoming as they were: Let me add in further palliation of this fault, that he never puts ob&s;cenity but in the mouths of ob&s;cene characters, and &s;o applies it as to give his hearers a di&s;gu&s;t for &s;uch un&s;eemly habits. Morality I confe&s;s de&s;erves a purer vehicle, yet I contend that his purpo&s;e was hone&s;t, and I dare believe went farther towards reforming the loo&s;e Athenians, than all the in|deci&s;ive po&s;itions of the philo&s;ophers, who being enli&s;ted into &s;ects and factions &s;carce agreed in any one point of common morality.</P>
<P>This part of his defence would have been very ea&s;ily handled a century or two ago; Ben Jon&s;on for in&s;tance could have helped his argument out with his own example, if oc|ca&s;ion had required; but the ta&s;k falls very heavy upon an advocate in this age, which is of purer ears than to li&s;ten to ob&s;cenity; and

though my particular difficulties have thereby been encrea&s;ed, I &s;hall never repine under the weight of any burthen, which the merit of my contemporaries lays upon me.</P>
<P>His wit is of various kinds; much is of a general and permanent &s;tamp; much is local, per&s;onal and untransferable to po&s;terity: No author &s;till retains &s;o many brilliant pa&s;&s;ages, yet none has &s;uffered &s;uch injury by the de|predations of time: Of his powers in ridicule and humour, whether of character or dialogue, there might be no end to in&s;tances: If Plautus gives us the model of Epicharmus, he does not equal him; and if Ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nce tran&s;lates Me|nander, his original does not approach him in the&s;e particulars: I doubt if the &s;um total of wit and humour in all their &s;tage-lacqueys would together balance the &s;ingle character of <HI>Cario</HI> in the <HI>Plutus.</HI> His &s;atire, whether le|velled again&s;t the vices and follies of the people at large, again&s;t the corruption of the daema|gogues, the turpitude and chicanery of the philo&s;ophers, or the arrogant &s;elf-&s;ufficiency of the tragic poets, cuts with an edge that pene|trates the character, and leaves no &s;helter for either ignorance or criminality.</P>
<P>Ari&s;tophanes was author of above &s;ixty co|medies, though they are erroneou&s;ly &s;tated under

<P>I SAID in my former Paper that Plutarch had made a compari&s;on between Ari&s;topha|nes and Menander, and given his decided judg|ment for the latter. It might well be expected, that a Greek of the lower ages, living in the time of Trajan, and in court-favour with that emperor, &s;hould prefer a poli&s;hed elegant author like Menander to one &s;o bold, per&s;onal and &s;arca&s;tic as the poet he compares with him. Horace even in the time of Augu&s;tus had begun to decry the <HI>Plautinos Sales,</HI> and the manners were much more refined in Plutarch's time than in his. As we can take little e&s;timate of Menander from the fragments only of his comedies which now remain, we cannot &s;ee what general rea&s;ons Plutarch, or any other critic of his time, might have for preferring him; but as far as he has entered into &s;trictures and objections in his examination of Ari&s;to|phanes, &s;o far we can follow him; this part at lea&s;t of his critici&s;m is &s;till open to be contro|verted, and if it &s;hall appear that he has con|demned one party without rea&s;on, it may be pre&s;umed he has preferred the other without ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="157">Plutarch a&s;&s;erts that Ari&s;tophanes is a pun&s;ter, a quibbler upon words, and ridiculou&s;ly given to parody. It is unfortunate for this charge that he follows it up with quotations, in every one of which Ari&s;tophanes is not only to be defended but applauded; he could not have &s;elected pa&s;&s;ages le&s;s to the purpo&s;e; and the accu&s;ation has accordingly been turned again&s;t him by Fri&s;chlinus and other advocates of the poet.</P>
<P>He arraigns the &s;tile of Ari&s;tophanes on ac|count of its inequalities and variations, ob|&s;erving that it is &s;ometimes high and &s;ometimes low, now turgid and inflated, now grovelling and depre&s;&s;ed&mdash;as if he had not been aware that the great variety of characters, which his comedy exhibits, naturally demands as great a variety of &s;tile: He applauds Menander for the uniform and equal tenor of his &s;tile, not &s;eeming to recollect that his comedy on the contrary had one uniform complexion, con|tained no choru&s;&s;es and introduced no living characters; whereas Ari&s;tophanes, according to the &s;pirit of the old comedy, makes u&s;e of cho|ru&s;&s;es, many of which are of &s;o fanciful and imaginary a nature, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to employ all the powers of poetry in their di&s;|play, and in &s;ome ca&s;es even to create a new
<PB N="147" REF="158">
&s;tile (and almo&s;t language) for the occa&s;ion: He al&s;o introduces gods, heroes, poets, ora|tors, philo&s;ophers, amba&s;&s;adors, prie&s;ts on his &s;cene; &s;ome of the&s;e profe&s;&s;edly demand a &s;welling tragic pomp of words, for in&s;tance Ae&s;chylus, Sophocles and Euripides: In &s;hort, the very excellence of Ari&s;tophanes is di&s;crimi|nation of &s;tile and character. Should Socrates and a &s;lave &s;peak in the &s;ame phra&s;e? Should Lamachus (a mere <HI>miles glorio&s;us</HI>) talk in the tone of a beggarly Megaren&s;ian pedlar? Cer|tainly not; nor is there any need to dwell longer on this critici&s;m of Plutarch's, in which the ingenious author has &s;hewn little of his u&s;ual candour or judgment. That he &s;hould be prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the new comedy is very natural; elegant and moral fictions are both more plea&s;ing and more proper &s;ubjects for the drama, than bold and coar&s;e truths and living realities: The even &s;uavity of Menander's &s;tile might be more to his ta&s;te than the irregular &s;ublimity of Ari&s;tophanes's; but when I &s;ee him manage the argument in a manner &s;o much be|low his u&s;ual &s;agacity, I cannot help &s;u&s;pecting there might be &s;ome other be&s;ides general pre|judice in his mind again&s;t Ari&s;tophanes, and I make no doubt he had fo&s;tered &s;trong re&s;ent|ments again&s;t him for his attacks upon Socrates;
<PB N="148" REF="159">
I al&s;o &s;ee &s;ome grounds for believing that he had been oppo&s;ed by Pliny in his partiality for Me|nander, whom that author calls <HI>omnis luxuriae interpres</HI>; a charge which was re&s;ented by Plu|tarch, who neverthele&s;s was compelled to admit it: It is not improbable therefore that this might have given &s;ome occa&s;ion to him for en|tering into a more formal compari&s;on between the two authors, and for publi&s;hing his &s;trictures upon Ari&s;tophanes. Upon looking over the titles of the comedies of the la&s;t-named author, which are lo&s;t, I find one intitled <HI>Boeotia,</HI> which play was tran&s;lated and brought upon the Roman &s;tage by Plautus, as it is generally thought, though we are told that M. Varro gave it to one Aquilius; be this as it may, the comedy was produced by one or the other, and there is a fragment of it in proof, which will be found in Pareus's edition of Plautus: Here is fre&s;h rea&s;on for Plutarch (who was a Boeotian) to take up a re&s;entment again&s;t Ari&s;tophanes; and, if it were a &s;ubject worth following, I could &s;hew that Plutarch's national prejudices were uncommonly &s;trong: The comedy indeed is not in exi&s;tence, both original and tran&s;lation being peri&s;hed; but we can ea&s;ily believe that Boeotia did not e&s;cape out of Ari&s;tophanes's hands without a pretty &s;mart flagellation; and this was the more

galling to Plutarch, becau&s;e it was naturalized on the Roman &s;tage, and, if it was &s;till in re|pre&s;entation, might give a handle to the wits of the time for a run upon his native country. But I perceive my zeal is carrying me into an unprofitable re&s;earch, and I proceed with my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Ari&s;tophanes has &s;ometimes been reproached for his attacks upon Euripides; but this author was a fair &s;ubject for &s;atire in his literary cha|racter, and, though he was the friend of Socrates, his private morals were no le&s;s open to reproof. The voice of the heathen world has been &s;o loud in the prai&s;e of Socrates; he is &s;o decidedly the hero of all the Ciceros and declaimers upon morality, that even now, after &s;o many centuries of Chri&s;tianity, it is with a kind of &s;uper&s;titious reverence we approach his character. His con|temporaries, who &s;aw him in the neare&s;t light, treat him with the lea&s;t re&s;pect: Ari&s;tophanes (as Ben Jon&s;on expre&s;&s;es it) <HI>hoi&s;ted him up with a pulley, and made him play the philo&s;opher in a ba&s;ket; mea&s;ure how many foot a flea could &s;kip geometrically by a ju&s;t &s;cale, and edify the people from the engine.</HI>&mdash;Time and prejudice have &s;ince ca&s;t a veil before him, that it would be a hardy deed to attempt to withdraw.</P>
<P>This attack of Ari&s;tophanes has doomed him
<PB N="150" REF="161">
to almo&s;t univer&s;al dete&s;tation; the prai&s;e we give him is no more than his &s;uperior genius extorts, and it is paid grudgingly, like a tax, without cordiality or good-will: We admire him for his bold attacks upon Cleon, and we can find &s;ome palliation for his &s;trictures upon Euripides; the languid affectation of the poet, and the turbulent ferocity of the daemagogue, ju&s;tify the &s;atiri&s;t; but when he a&s;&s;aults the &s;acred character of Socrates, when he arraigns the un&s;potted purity of the great ma&s;ter of mo|rality, it is no longer &s;atire, it is &s;acrilege. But is all this to pa&s;s without one word for the poet? Was he given up by his contemporaries for this atrocious act? was he given up by the friends and di&s;ciples of Socrates? By none; not even by Plato him&s;elf, who on the contrary care&s;&s;ed, admired and extolled him both in ver&s;e and pro&s;e; he adopted his &s;entiments on the &s;ubject of <HI>Love,</HI> and engrafted them into his own <HI>Sym|po&s;ium:</HI> He applauded him to Diony&s;ius of Sy|racu&s;e, and put his comedies into his hands as the only pure and perfect model of Attic ele|gance: The tyrant read them, admired them and even rehear&s;ed them by heart; nay he did more, he turned poet him&s;elf, and wrote a play for the Athenian &s;tage, which of cour&s;e was honoured with a prize. And now why &s;hould
<PB N="151" REF="162">
we be more angry than Plato was? What have we di&s;covered, which he did not know, that we &s;hould take the matter up &s;o high? We have di&s;covered that Ari&s;tophanes took a bribe of Melitus and his faction to attack Socrates, and pave the way for their criminal charge, by which he &s;uffered; and this we take upon credit from Aelian's in&s;inuations in an article of his <HI>Various Hi&s;tory,</HI> which for its authority in this ca&s;e is about as good an evidence, as any &s;tory out of the <HI>Incredibilia</HI> of <HI>Palaephatus Heraclitus.</HI> Aelian however does not hardily advance this as a fact, but hooks it in by way of que&s;tion&mdash;<HI>Where is the ab&s;urdity,</HI> he a&s;ks, <HI>of &s;uppo&s;ing that the poet, who was known to be needy, had taken a bribe?</HI>&mdash;This is a mere in&s;inuation, by which he tries the credulity of his readers: If they will believe it, &s;o much the better for his purpo&s;e; if not, he has nothing el&s;e to offer; he has done his be&s;t to blacken the character of Ari&s;tophanes in this ca&s;e, as he did in that of his intemperance: He has accu&s;ed him of writing plays when he was drunk, and now he accu&s;es him of taking a bribe for writing them: The man who believes the one, may take the other into the bargain; for his own part, the improbability &s;tares him &s;o fully in the face, that he immediately &s;ubjoins to his in&s;inuation above quoted&mdash;<HI>That for the</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="163">
<HI>truth of this, it was be&s;t known to Ari&s;tophanes him&s;elf.</HI>&mdash;This can never pa&s;s with any candid reader. As for the &s;ucce&s;s of the attack, that he confe&s;&s;es was beyond all example; the co|medy was applauded to the &s;kies; never did any poet receive &s;uch honours from the public, as Ari&s;tophanes for this play of <HI>The Clouds.</HI></P>
<P>As to the charge of the bribe, I need not ob&s;erve, that if it was not an ea&s;y thing for any advocate of the poet to prove the negative in Hadrian's days, when Aelian threw it out, it cannot be le&s;s difficult now to do it, when more than two millenniums have interpo&s;ed between the fact and our examination of it: And yet we know that Ari&s;tophanes, in a &s;hort time after the repre&s;entation of his <HI>Clouds,</HI> brought this very Melitus, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;uborned him by a bribe, before the audience, and ex|po&s;ed his vicious character with the mo&s;t un|&s;paring &s;everity. If this is not proving a ne|gative, it is as near it as circum&s;tance and pre&s;umption can go.</P>
<P>But there is another part of Aelian's charge which can be more clearly di&s;proved than the above, and this is the a&s;&s;ertion he advances, that this attack upon Socrates from the &s;tage was contrived by Anytus and Melitus as a pre|lude to their criminal accu&s;ation of him: This
<PB N="153" REF="164">
Aelian expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts, adding that the faction were afraid of his popularity, and therefore &s;et Ari&s;tophanes upon him to feel the pul&s;e of the people, before they ventured to bring their public charge again&s;t him. Here he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">atly con|futes him&s;elf; for had this been the proving attack, what experiment could an&s;wer more completely, when even by his own account all Athens was in raptures with the poet, and the comedy went off with more general applau&s;e than any was ever known to receive? nay, more than this, Socrates him&s;elf according to Aelian's own account was pre&s;ent in the theatre, and &s;tood up in view of the people all the while; yet in &s;pite of his pre&s;ence, in defiance of this bold appeal, the theatre rung with plaudits, and the philo&s;opher only &s;tood up to be a more con&s;pi|cuous mark of raillery and contempt. Why then did not the faction &s;eize the opportunity and &s;econd the blow? Could any thing an&s;wer more fully to their wi&s;hes? or rather, could any event turn out more beyond their expecta|tion? From Aelian's account we are left to conclude that this was the ca&s;e, and that this attack was literally a prelude to their charge; but this inference is alike di&s;ingenuous with all the re&s;t, for we know from indubitable dates that <HI>The Clouds</HI> were acted at lea&s;t <HI>eighteen years</HI>

before the death of Socrates: It was in the fir&s;t year of Olymp.

<P><HI>THE Clouds</HI> is a &s;atirical and per&s;onal co|medy, the moral of which is to &s;hew how the &s;ophi&s;try of the &s;chools may be employed as an in&s;trument of fraud and eva&s;ion in matters of right and property; this is its principal ob|ject: But it touches al&s;o upon other points by the way, and humorou&s;ly expo&s;es certain new and chimerical notions about the relation of children to their parents, and of the influence of <HI>The Clouds,</HI> as &s;uperior to the &s;uperintending power of Jupiter.</P>
<P>Of its moral therefore, &s;eparately con&s;idered (comprehending the chief duties and relations of men, whether to the gods, to their parents or to &s;ociety at large) there can be no doubt; its excellence and importance &s;peak for them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The comedy being written before the practice was re&s;trained of bringing living characters on the &s;tage, a &s;chool is here introduced, and the greate&s;t philo&s;opher of the time is repre&s;ented in per&s;on on the &s;tage: This philo&s;opher is Socrates him&s;elf, and the &s;chool is the &s;chool of Socrates.</P>
<P>Socrates is made to advance the hypothe&s;is of
<PB N="156" REF="167">
<HI>The Clouds</HI> before mentioned; but it &s;hould be con&s;tantly kept in remembrance, that he lays down no doctrines, as principles of fraud or inju&s;tice: It is not the teacher who recom|mends, but his di&s;ciples who pervert his in|&s;tructions to the evil purpo&s;e of defrauding and cluding their creditors: The like remark holds good in the ca&s;e of the natural duty of children to their parents: The &s;on in the play it is true &s;trikes and beats his father on the &s;tage, and he quotes the maxims of Socrates in ju&s;tification; but he does not quote them as po&s;itive rules and injunctions for an act &s;o atrocious; he only &s;hews that &s;ophi&s;try may be turned to defend that, or any other thing equally violent and out|rageous.</P>
<P>There are two lights in which Socrates is to be viewed; fir&s;t, in his public character as a teacher; &s;econdly, in his private one as a man. It is chiefly in the former of the&s;e that Ari|&s;tophanes has attacked him; and (as I before ob&s;erved) it is to expo&s;e the evil u&s;es rather than the evil nature of his doctrines, that he brings his &s;chool upon the &s;tage; for when the di&s;ciple is que&s;tioned about the &s;tudies which his ma&s;ter is employed in, he makes report of &s;ome frivolous and minute re&s;earches, which are introduced only for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a

<P>After all it mu&s;t be allowed, that the&s;e &s;emi|naries of &s;ophi&s;try, which the &s;tate of Athens thought it nece&s;&s;ary to put down by public edict, could not have been improper &s;ubjects for dramatic ridicule; for if the &s;chools were found &s;o detrimental to the morals of youth, that the archons and their council, after due deliberation, re&s;olved upon a general expul&s;ion of all ma&s;ters and teachers thereunto belonging, and effectually did expel them, &s;urely the poet may be ac|quitted, when he &s;atirizes tho&s;e obnoxious par|ties, whom the laws of his country in a &s;hort time after cut off from the community.</P>
<P>There can be little doubt but this was a public mea&s;ure founded in wi&s;dom, if it were for no other rea&s;on, than that the Lacedaemo|nians never &s;uffered a ma&s;ter of philo&s;ophy to open &s;chool within their realm and juri&s;diction, holding them in abhorrence, and pro&s;cribing their academies as &s;eminaries of evil manners; and tending to the corruption of youth: It is well known what peculiar care and attention were be&s;towed upon the education of the Spartan youth, and how much more moral this people was, who admitted no philo&s;ophers to &s;ettle among&s;t them, than their Athenian neigh|bours,
<PB N="158" REF="169">
in who&s;e di&s;&s;olute capital they &s;warmed. In fact, the enormity became too great to be redre&s;&s;ed; the whole community was infected with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the&s;e &s;ectaries; and the liberties of Athens, which depended on the public virtue of her citizens, fell a &s;acrifice to the corruptions of fal&s;e philo&s;ophy: The wi&s;er Lacedaemonians &s;aw the fatal error of their rivals, and availed them&s;elves of its con&s;equen|ces; they ro&s;e upon the ruins of Athens, and it was the triumph of wi&s;dom over wit: The&s;e philo&s;ophers were ingenious men, but execrable citizens; and when the raillery of the &s;tage was turned again&s;t them, the weapons of ridicule could not be more laudably employed.</P>
<P>As for the &s;chool of Socrates in particular, though it may be a fa&s;hion to extol it, there is no rea&s;on to believe it was in better credit than any other; on the contrary, it was in &s;uch public di&s;repute on account of the infamous characters of many of his di&s;ciples, and of the di&s;graceful attachments he was known to have, that it was at one time de&s;erted by every body except Ae&s;chines, the para&s;ite of the tyrant Diony&s;ius, and the mo&s;t worthle&s;s man living: This Ae&s;chines, his &s;ole and favourite di&s;ciple, was arraigned by the pleader Ly&s;ias, and convicted of the vile&s;t frauds, and branded as a public cheat:
<PB N="159" REF="170">
He was a wretch, who employed the &s;ophi&s;try and cunning argumentation, which he learnt of his ma&s;ter, to the purpo&s;e only of evading his debts, contracted by the mo&s;t profligate extra|vagancies: He afterwaads went over to the &s;chool of Plato, and when Socrates was dead, had influence enough with Xantippe to obtain of her &s;ome dialogues from her hu&s;band's papers, which he publi&s;hed as his own, and &s;et up for an author and preceptor in philo&s;ophy. It is very probable Ari&s;tophanes had in view the character of this very Ae&s;chines, when he brings his old man on the &s;cene, con&s;ulting Socrates for &s;ophi&s;tical eva&s;ions how to elude his cre|ditors.</P>
<P>Another of the &s;cholars of Socrates was <HI>Simon</HI> the &s;ophi&s;t, a man who&s;e rapacity be|came a proverb (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>Simoni rapacior</HI>).

<P>Ari&s;tippus, the Cyrenaic founder, was a di&s;|tingui&s;hed di&s;ciple of the Socratic &s;chool, a pa|ra&s;ite al&s;o in the court of Diony&s;ius, a buffoon and drunkard, the avowed oppo&s;er of every thing virtuous, a ma&s;ter and profe&s;&s;or of immo|rality, who laid down in&s;titutes of &s;en&s;uality and reduced it to a &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Of Alcibiades I &s;hall briefly &s;peak, for the &s;tories of Socrates's attachment to him are &s;uch as need not be enlarged upon; they obtained &s;o generally, that he was vulgarly called Alcibiades's Sile&s;ius: When I glance at the&s;e reports in disfavour of a character, which probably &s;tands &s;o high in the opinion of the learned reader, I mu&s;t hope for a candid interpretation of my motives for collecting the&s;e anecdotes, which I do not wi&s;h to apply to any other purpo&s;e than merely to &s;hew that Ari&s;tophanes was not &s;in|gular
<PB N="161" REF="172">
in his attack upon this celebrated philo|&s;opher; neither did this attack bear &s;o hard again&s;t him, as many &s;tories, then in general circulation, otherwi&s;e did: Great authorities have a&s;cribed his attachment to Alcibiades to the mo&s;t virtuous principle; common fame, or perhaps (more properly &s;peaking) common de|famation, turned it into a charge of the im|pure&s;t nature: In like manner we find him ri|diculed for his devotion to the noted A&s;pa&s;ia, in who&s;e company he is &s;aid to have pa&s;&s;ed much of his time; and Athenaeus quotes &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of his dialogues with her, which he tells us were publi&s;hed by Herodicus, and which we mu&s;t either totally reject, or allow him to have been &s;ubject to &s;uch private weakne&s;&s;es and frailties, as were very un&s;uitable to his public character: What were the real motives for his frequent vi&s;its to A&s;pa&s;ia, as well as for his &s;eeming attachment to the &s;trumpet Theodote, mu&s;t be left to conjecture; of the fact there is no room to doubt. He is &s;tigmatized for his guilty connections in his youth with his pre|ceptor Archelaus, and yet this charge (how|ever improbable it may &s;eem) re&s;ts upon the authority of Ari&s;toxenus, a man of the mo&s;t candid character, and who&s;e credit &s;tands high with all true critics. Herodicus the hi&s;torian,
<PB N="162" REF="173">
whom I have before mentioned, and who lived about three hundred and fifty years before the Chri&s;tian aera, &s;eems to have treated Socrates with the greate&s;t &s;everity, charging him with &s;itting up all night drinking and carou&s;ing with Agatho and others, whom when he had left drunk and a&s;leep, he reeled into the Lyceum, more fit (in the words quoted from the relater) for the &s;ociety of Homer's cannibals, than of tho&s;e he found there: In this debauch it is pre|tended, that although Phedrus, Eryximachus and many other potent drinkers fled the com|pany, Socrates &s;ate to the la&s;t, &s;wallowing drenches of wine out of enormous goblets of &s;ilver: He de&s;cribes him &s;itting among&s;t la&s;ci|vious revellers at a banquet, where dancing-girls and boys were exhibiting their indecent attitudes to the mu&s;ic of harpers and min&s;trels: He expo&s;es this ma&s;ter of morality entering into a controver&s;y with his &s;cholar Critobulus upon the &s;ubject of male beauty; and becau&s;e Critobulus had ridiculed him for his ugline&s;s, he a&s;&s;erts that Socrates challenged him to a naked exhibition, and that he actually expo&s;ed his un&s;eemly per&s;on to a Pathic and a dancing-girl, the appointed umpires of the di&s;pute; the conqueror was to be rewarded with an embrace from each of the&s;e umpires, as the prize of &s;u|perior

beauty, and the deci&s;ion was of con&s;e|quence given <HI>ex ab&s;urdo</HI> to the philo&s;opher, in preference to one of the hand&s;ome&s;t young men in Greece, and he enjoyed the prize annexed to the decree. If we can believe this anecdote to have been gravely related by an hi&s;torian, who lived &s;o near to him in point of time, we &s;hall cea&s;e to wonder that Ari&s;tophanes had the whole theatre on his &s;ide, when &s;uch &s;tories were in circulation again&s;t the character of Socrates.</P>
<P>As I have no other object in view but to offer what occurs to me in defence of Ari&s;tophanes, who appears to have been mo&s;t unju&s;tly accu&s;ed of taking bribes for his attack upon Socrates, and of having paved the way for the cruel &s;en|tence by which he &s;uffered death, I &s;hall here conclude an invidious ta&s;k, which my &s;ubject, not my choice, has laid upon me.</P>
<P>In our volume of Ari&s;tophanes, the comedies are not placed according to the order of time in which they were produced: There is rea&s;on to think that <HI>The Acharnen&s;ians</HI> was the fir&s;t of its author; it was acted in the la&s;t year of Olymp. LXXXV. when the edict was rever&s;ed which prohibited the repre&s;entation of comedies; and it is &s;aid that Ari&s;tophanes brought it out in the name of Calli&s;tratus the comedian.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t year of Olymp. LXXXVIII. he
<PB N="164" REF="175">
produced his comedy of <HI>The Knights,</HI> in which he per&s;onally attacks the tribune Cleon.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t year of Olymp. LXXXIX. he produced his fir&s;t comedy of <HI>The Clouds,</HI> and in the year following his &s;econd of that title, which is now in our hands, and ranks as third in the volume.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year was acted his comedy of <HI>The Wa&s;ps,</HI> in which he &s;atirizes the General Chares for his conduct in the unfortunate expe|dition to Sicily.</P>
<P>In the fourth year of Olymp. XC. we may place his comedy intitled <HI>The Peace.</HI> In the fir&s;t of Olymp. XCI. <HI>The Ly&s;i&s;trata</HI>; and in the &s;econd of the &s;ame Olympiad that of <HI>The Birds.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The The&s;mophoriagu&s;ae,</HI> or <HI>Cerealia Celebrantes,</HI> and <HI>Concionatrices,</HI> fall within the period of Olymp. XCII. before the death of Euripides, who is &s;atirized in the former of the&s;e pieces.</P>

<P><HI>The Plutus,</HI> which completes the eleven co|medies &s;till remaining, and the la&s;t, to which he prefixed his own name, was produced in the fourth year of Olymp. XCVII.</P>

happily re&s;cued this valuable, though &s;mall, por|tion of his favourite author from his more &s;cru|pulous Chri&s;tian contemporaries, who&s;e zeal was fatally too &s;ucce&s;sful in de&s;troying every other comic author, out of a very numerous collection, of which no one entire &s;cene now remains.</P>

<P>I SHALL now proceed to mention &s;ome other principal writers of the old comedy, of who&s;e works, though once the favourites of the Athenian &s;tage, few memorials &s;urvive, and the&s;e &s;o &s;mall and imperfect, and withal &s;o &s;epa|rated from each other (con&s;i&s;ting only of &s;hort quotations in the &s;cholia&s;ts and grammarians) that it is a ta&s;k to collect them, which nothing would compen&s;ate but the hope of being in &s;ome degree the in&s;trument of &s;aving from ab|&s;olute extinction the names of authors once &s;o illu&s;trious.</P>
<P>AMIPSIAS was a contemporary of Ari&s;topha|nes, and no mean rival; we have the titles of ten comedies of this author. In &s;ome of the&s;e

<P>PLATO was a comic poet, high in time and character; a collection of no le&s;s than forty titles of his comedies has been made by the learned Meur&s;ius, but very few fragments of the&s;e are remaining. Clemens a&s;&s;erts that Ari|&s;tophanes and Plato were mutually charged of borrowing from each other, which in one &s;en&s;e makes greatly to the reputation of our poet. He is quoted by Plutarch in his Alcibiades, and very honourably mentioned by the famous Galen, by Athenaeus, Clemens, Julius Pollux and Suidas.

<P>CRATES, by birth an Athenian, was fir&s;t an actor, and afterwards a writer of the old co|medy; he performed the principal characters in Cratinus's plays, and was the great rival of Ari&s;tophanes's favourite actors Calli&s;tratus and Philonides; we have the titles of more than twenty comedies, and but four &s;mall fragments of this author: I have &s;earched for his remains more diligently, from the circum&s;tance of his having been &s;o celebrated an actor; a pro|fe&s;&s;ion which centers in it&s;elf more gifts of nature, education, art and &s;tudy, than any other. His comedies are &s;aid to have been of a very gay and facetious ca&s;t; and the author of the <HI>Prolegomena</HI> to Ari&s;tophanes informs us, that he was the fir&s;t who introduced a drunken character on the Athenian &s;tage; to this anec|dote I give credit, becau&s;e no one could better know how entirely &s;uch an attempt depends upon the di&s;cretion and addre&s;s of the actor, who has &s;uch a part in his keeping: It is plain the experiment &s;ucceeded, becau&s;e even the tra|gedians exhibited &s;uch characters in &s;ucceeding times. Modern experience &s;hews us, how &s;ub|ject &s;uch repre&s;entations are to be outraged;
<PB N="170" REF="181">
the performer generally forgetting, or not know|ing, that his own &s;obriety &s;hould keep the drunkenne&s;s he counterfeits within its proper bounds. Ari&s;totle a&s;cribes to Crates another innovation with re&s;pect to the iambic metre of the old comedy, which he made more free and appo&s;ite to familiar dialogue; this al&s;o corre|&s;ponds with the natural and facetious character of his drama. I cannot &s;ay the four &s;mall fragments which I have collected bear that &s;tamp; on the contrary, they are of a grave and &s;ententious ca&s;t: One of them is an ob&s;er|vation on the effects of poverty, which Horace has either literally tran&s;lated, or &s;truck upon the very &s;ame thoughts in the following pa&s;|&s;age:

<P>Athenaeus has pre&s;erved a con&s;iderable frag|ment from this author, extracted from his co|medy of <HI>The Miners,</HI> which I look upon to be as curious a &s;pecimen of the old comedy as I have met with. It is a very luxuriant de&s;crip|tion of the riches and abundance of &s;ome former times to which he alludes, &s;trongly da&s;hed with comic &s;trokes of wild extravagance and hyper|bole. The&s;e <HI>Miners</HI> were probably the chorus of the drama, which no doubt was of a &s;atirical &s;ort, and pointed at the luxuries of the rich. By the mention made of Plutus in the fir&s;t line, we may &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e <HI>Mines</HI> were of gold, and probably the deity of that precious metal was one of the per&s;ons of the drama.</P>

<P>AMPHIS, the &s;on of Amphicrates an Athenian, was a celebrated comic poet: We have the titles of one and twenty comedies, and he probably wrote many more: By the&s;e titles it appears that he wrote in the &s;atirical vein of the old comedy, and I meet with a &s;troke at his contemporary Plato the philo&s;opher. He has a play intitled <HI>The Seven Chiefs again&s;t Thebes,</HI> which is pro|bably a parody upon Ae&s;chylus, and proves that he wrote after the per&s;onal drama was prohi|bited: There is another called <HI>The Dicers</HI>; and by &s;everal &s;cattered pa&s;&s;ages he appears to have expo&s;ed the per&s;ons of drunkards, game&s;ters, courte&s;ans, para&s;ites, and other vicious characters of his time, with great moral &s;everity: There are al&s;o two comedies, intitled <HI>Women's Love</HI> and <HI>Women's Tyranny.</HI></P>
<P>HERMIPPUS was a writer of the old comedy, and an Athenian. No le&s;s than forty comedies are given to this author by Suidas; he attacks Pericles for his di&s;&s;olute morals, and in one of his plays calls him <HI>King of the Satyrs,</HI> advi&s;ing him to a&s;&s;ume the proper attributes of his la&s;ci|vious character: He was the &s;on of Ly&s;ides, and the brother of Myrtilus, a comic writer al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="188">HIPPARCHUS, PHILONIDES and THEOPOM|PUS complete the li&s;t of poets of the old comedy. Philonides, before he became a votary of the mu&s;e, followed the trade of a fuller, and, if we are to take the word of Ari&s;tophanes, was a very &s;illy vulgar fellow, illiterate to a proverb. Athe|naeus and Stobaeus have however given us &s;ome &s;hort quotations, which by no means favour this account, and it is probable there was more &s;atire than truth in Ari&s;tophanes's character of him. Theopompus is de&s;cribed as a man of ex|cellent morals, and though he was long afflicted with a defluxion in his eyes, which put him from his &s;tudies, time has pre&s;erved the titles of twenty-four comedies of his compo&s;ing: Very little remains upon record either of him or his works.</P>
<P>One &s;hort fragment of Philonides is all that remains of his works, and it is a &s;pecimen which convinces me that we mu&s;t not always take the character of a poet from a contemporary wit, engaged in the &s;ame &s;tudies.<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<P>PREJUDICE is &s;o wide a word, that if we would have our&s;elves under&s;tood, we mu&s;t always u&s;e &s;ome auxiliary term with it to define our meaning: Thus when we &s;peak of national prejudices, prejudices of education, or religious prejudices, by compounding our expre&s;&s;ion we convey ideas very different from each other.</P>
<P>National prejudice is by &s;ome called a virtue, but the virtue of it con&s;i&s;ts only in the proper application and moderate degree of it. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed a happy attachment, which can reconcile the Laplander to his freezing &s;nows, and the African to his &s;corching &s;un. There are &s;ome portions of the globe &s;o partially en|dowed
<PB N="179" REF="190">
by Providence with climate and pro|ductions, that were it not for this prejudice to the <HI>natale &s;olum,</HI> the greater part of the ha|bitable world would be a &s;cene of envy and repining. National predilection is in this &s;en&s;e a ble&s;&s;ing, and perhaps a virtue; but if it ope|rates otherwi&s;e than in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e of its defi|nition, it perverts the judgment, and in &s;ome ca&s;es vitiates the heart. It is an old &s;aying, that <HI>charity begins at home,</HI> but this is no rea&s;on it &s;hould not go abroad: A man &s;hould live with the world as a citizen of the world; he may have a preference for the particular quarter, or &s;quare, or even alley in which he lives, but he &s;hould have a generous feeling for the welfare of the whole; and if in his rambles through this great city (the world) he may chance upon a man of a different habit, language or complexion from his own, &s;till he is a fellow-citizen, a &s;hort &s;ojourner in common with him|&s;elf, &s;ubject to the &s;ame wants, infirmities and nece&s;&s;ities, and one that has a brother's claim upon him for his charity, candour and relief. It were to be wi&s;hed no traveller would leave his own country without the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, and it would be &s;till better if all who live in it would adopt them; but as an <HI>Ob&s;erver</HI> of mankind (let me &s;peak it to the honour of my country|men)
<PB N="180" REF="191">
I have very little to reproach them with on this account: It would be hard if a nation, more addicted to travel than any other in Eu|rope, had not rubbed off this ru&s;t of the &s;oul in their excur&s;ions and colli&s;ions; it would be an indelible reproach, if a people, &s;o ble&s;t at home, were not benevolent abroad. Our ingenious neighbours the French are le&s;s agreeable gue&s;ts than ho&s;ts: I am afraid their national prejudices reach a little beyond candour in mo&s;t ca&s;es, and they are too apt to indulge a vanity, which does not become &s;o enlightened a nation, by &s;hutting their eyes again&s;t every light except their own; but I do a violence to my feelings, when I ex|pre&s;s my&s;elf unfavourably of a people, with whom we have long been implicated in the mo&s;t ho|nourable of all connections, the mutual pur&s;uits of literary fame, and a glorious emulation in arts and &s;ciences.</P>
<P>Prejudices of education are le&s;s dangerous than religious prejudices, le&s;s common than na|tional ones, and more excu&s;able than any; in general they are little el&s;e than ridiculous habits, which cannot obtain much in a country where public education prevails, and &s;uch as a com|merce with the world can hardly fail to cure: They are characteri&s;tic of &s;eraglio princes; the property of &s;eque&s;tered beings, who live in
<PB N="181" REF="192">
celibacy and retirement, contracted in childhood and confirmed by age: A man, who has pa&s;&s;ed his life on &s;hipboard, will pace the length of his quarter-deck on the terrace before his hou&s;e, were it a mile in length.</P>
<P>The&s;e are harmle&s;s peculiarities, but it is ob|vious to experience that prejudices of a very evil nature may be contracted by habits of edu|cation; and the very defective &s;tate of the po|lice, which is &s;uffered yet to go on without re|form in and about our capital, furni&s;hes too many examples of our fatal inattention to the morals of our infant poor: Among&s;t the many wretched culprits who &s;uffer death by the law, how many are there, who, when &s;tanding at the bar to receive &s;entence of execution, might urge this plea in extenuation of their guilt!</P>
<Q>This action, which you are plea&s;ed to term criminal, I have been taught to con&s;ider as meritorious: The arts of fraud and thieving, by which I gained my living, are arts in|&s;tilled into me by my parents, habits wherein I was educated from my infancy, a trade to which I was regularly bred: If the&s;e are things not to be allowed of, and a violation of the laws, it behoved the laws to prevent them, rather than to puni&s;h them; for I can|not &s;ee the equity of putting me to death for
<PB N="182" REF="193">
actions, which, if your police had taken any charge of me in my infancy, I never had committed. If you would &s;ecure your&s;elves from receiving wrong, you &s;hould teach us not to do wrong; and this might ea&s;ily be effected, if you had any eye upon your pari&s;h poor. For my part, I was born and bred in the pari&s;h of Saint Giles; my parents kept a &s;hop for the retail of gin, and old rags; chri&s;tening I had none; a church I never entered, and no pari&s;h officer ever vi&s;ited our habitation: If he had done &s;o, he would have found a &s;eminary of thieves and pick-pockets, a magazine of &s;tolen goods, a hou&s;e of call where nightly depredators met together to compare accounts, and make merry over their plunder: Among&s;t the&s;e and by the&s;e I was educated; I obeyed them as my ma&s;ters, and I looked up to them as my examples: I be|lieved them to be great men; I heard them recount their actions with glory; I &s;aw them die like heroes, and I attended their execu|tions with triumph. It is now my turn to &s;uffer, and I hope I &s;hall not prove my&s;elf unworthy of the calling in which I have been brought up: If there be any fault in my conduct, the fault is yours; for, being the child of poverty, I was the &s;on of the public:
<PB N="183" REF="194">
If there be any honour, it is my own; for I have acted up to my in&s;tructions in all things, and faithfully fulfilled the purpo&s;es of my education.</Q>
<P>I cannot excu&s;e my&s;elf from touching upon one more prejudice, which may be called na|tural, or &s;elf-prejudice: Under correction of the <HI>Dampers</HI> I hope I may be allowed to &s;ay, that a certain portion of this is a good quickener in all con&s;titutions; being &s;ea&s;onably applied, it acts like the &s;pur in the wing of the o&s;trich, and keeps indu&s;try awake: Being of the nature of all volatiles and provocatives, the merit of it con&s;i&s;ts in the moderation and di&s;cretion which admini&s;ter it: If a man rightly knows him&s;elf, he may be called wi&s;e; if he ju&s;tly confides in him&s;elf, he may be accounted happy; but if he keeps both this knowledge and this confidence to him&s;elf, he will neither be le&s;s wi&s;e nor le&s;s happy for &s;o doing: If there are any &s;ecrets, which a man ought to keep from his neare&s;t friends, this is one of them. If there were no better rea&s;on why a man &s;hould not vaunt him&s;elf, but becau&s;e it is robbing the poor mountebanks of their livelihood, methinks it would be rea&s;on enough: If he mu&s;t think aloud upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, let him lock him&s;elf into his clo&s;et, and take it out in &s;oliloquy: If
<PB N="184" REF="195">
he likes the &s;ound of his own prai&s;es there, and can reconcile him&s;elf to the belief of them, it will then be time enough to try their effect upon other people.</P>
<P>Ventidius is the mode&s;te&s;t of all men; he blu&s;hes when he &s;ees him&s;elf applauded in the public papers; he has a better rea&s;on for blu&s;h|ing than the world is aware of; he knows him&s;elf to be the author of what he reads.</P>
<P>It &s;eems a matter pretty generally agreed between all tellers and hearers of &s;tories, that one party &s;hall work by the rule of addition, and the other by that of &s;ub&s;traction: In mo&s;t narratives, where the relater is a party in the &s;cene, I have remarked that the <HI>&s;ays-I</HI> has a decided advantage in a dialogue over the <HI>&s;ays-he</HI>; few people take an under-part in their own fable. There is a &s;alvo, however, which &s;ome gentlemen make u&s;e of (but I cannot recommend it) of hooking in a word to their own advantage, with the preface of <HI>I think I may &s;ay without vanity</HI>&mdash;and after all, if it was not for the vanity of it, there would be no need to &s;ay it at all.</P>
<P>I knew a gentleman who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more real accompli&s;hments, than fall to one man's lot in a thou&s;and; he was an excellent painter, a fine mu&s;ician, a good &s;cholar, and more than all a
<PB N="185" REF="196">
very worthy man&mdash;but he could not ride: It &s;o happened, that upon a morning's airing I detected him in the attempt of mounting on the back of a little pony, no taller than his whip, and as quiet as a lamb: Two &s;tout fellows held the animal by the head, whil&s;t my friend was performing a variety of very inge|nious manoeuvres for lodging him&s;elf upon the &s;addle by the aid of a &s;tirrup, which nearly touched the ground: I am afraid I &s;miled, when I ought not &s;o to have done, for it is certain it gave offence to my worthy friend, who &s;oon after joined me on his pony, which he a&s;&s;ured me was remarkably vitious, particu|larly at mounting; but that he had been giving him &s;ome proper di&s;cipline, which he doubted not would cure him of his evil tricks;

<HEAD>TO THE OBSERVER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a plain man without preten&s;ions, and lead a retired life in the country: The &s;ports of the &s;ea&s;on, a &s;mall farm, which I hold in my own hands, and a pretty good kitchen garden, in which I take amu&s;ement, with the help of a few Engli&s;h books, have hitherto made my life, though it is that of a bachelor, pa&s;s off with more than tolerable comfort. By this account of my time you will perceive that mo&s;t of my enjoy|ments depend upon the weather; and though the wear-and-tear of age may have made me more &s;en&s;ible to the &s;ea&s;ons than I have been, yet I cannot help thinking that our climate in England is as much altered for the wor&s;e, as my con&s;titution may be. I do not pretend to rea&s;on upon natural cau&s;es, but &s;peak upon ob&s;ervation only; for by an exact journal of my time (which I keep more for a check upon my actions than for any importance which appertains to them) I can find that I am obliged to my books for helping me through more rainy hours in the
<PB N="187" REF="198">
cour&s;e of years la&s;t pa&s;t, than I have been ac|cu&s;tomed to be, or indeed than I could wi&s;h; for you mu&s;t know I never read, when I can amu&s;e my&s;elf out of doors.</P>
<P>My &s;tudies are but trifling, for I am no &s;cho|lar, but in bad weather and dark evenings they have &s;erved to fill up time; a very little di&s;cou|ragement however &s;uffices to put me out of con|ceit with my books, and I have thoughts of lay|ing them totally on the &s;helf, as &s;oon as ever I can provide &s;ome harmle&s;s &s;ub&s;titute in their place: This you &s;ee is not &s;o ea&s;y for me to do, being a &s;olitary man, and one that hates drinking, e&s;pecially by my&s;elf; add to this that I &s;moke no tobacco, and have more rea&s;ons than I chu&s;e to explain again&s;t engaging in the nuptial &s;tate: My hou&s;ekeeper it is true is a decent conver&s;ible woman, and plays a good game at all-fours; and I had begun to fill up an hour in her company, till I was &s;urpri&s;ed unawares by a neighbour, who is a wag and has never cea&s;ed jeering me upon it ever &s;ince: I took next to making nets for my currant bu&s;hes, but alas! I have worked my&s;elf out of all employ and am got weary of the trade: I have thought of making fi&s;hing-rods; but I have a neighbour &s;o tenacious of his trout, that I &s;hould only breed a quarrel, and fi&s;h in troubled waters, were I to attempt it. To
<PB N="188" REF="199">
make &s;hort of my &s;tory, Sir, I have been obliged after many efforts to go back to my books, tho' I have lo&s;t all the little reli&s;h I had for them ever &s;ince I have been honoured with the vi&s;its of a learned gentleman, who is lately &s;ettled in my neighbourhood. He mu&s;t be a prodigious &s;cho|lar, for I believe in my con&s;cience he knows every thing that ever was written, and every body that ever writes. He has taken a world of kind pains I mu&s;t confe&s;s to &s;et me right in a thou&s;and things, that I was ignorant enough to be plea&s;ed with: He is a fine-&s;poken man, and in &s;pite of my &s;tupidity has the patience to con|vince me of the faults and blunders of every author in his turn: When he &s;hews them to me, I &s;ee them as clear as day, and never take up the book again; he has now gone pretty nearly through my whole ne&s;t of &s;helves, pointing out, as he proceeds, what I like a fool never &s;aw before, nor ever &s;hould have &s;een but for him. I u&s;ed to like a <HI>Spectator</HI> now and then, and generally &s;ought out for <HI>Clio,</HI> which I was told were Mr. Addi&s;on's papers; but I have been in a gro&s;s mi&s;take, to lo&s;e my time with a man that cannot write common Engli&s;h; for my friend has proved this to me out of a fine book, three times as big as the <HI>Spectator</HI>; and, which is
<PB N="189" REF="200">
more, this great book is made by a foreign gen|tleman, who writes and &s;peaks clear another lan|guage from Mr. Addi&s;on; &s;urely he mu&s;t be a dunce indeed, who is to be taught his mother tongue by a &s;tranger! I was apt to be tickled with &s;ome of our Engli&s;h poets, Dryden and Pope and Milton, and one Gray, that turns out to be a very contemptible fellow truly, for he has &s;hewn me all their &s;ecret hi&s;tories in print, written by a learned man greater than them all put together, and now I would not give a ru&s;h for one of them; I could find in my heart to &s;end <HI>Bell</HI> and all his books to the devil. As for all the writers now living, my neighbour, who by the way has a hand in reviewing their works, a&s;&s;ures me he can make nothing of them, and indeed I wonder that a man of his genius will have any thing to &s;ay to them. It was my cu&s;|tom to read a chapter or two in the Bible on a Sunday night; but there I am wrong again; I &s;hall not enter upon the &s;ubject here, but it won't do, that I am convinced of, Sir; it po&s;i|tively will not do.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of my writing to you at all is only to let you know, that I received a volume of your Ob&s;erver by the coach; my friend has ca&s;t his eye over it, and I have returned it by the

<P>I &s;hall give no other an&s;wer to my corre&s;pon|dent but to lament his lo&s;s of &s;o innocent a re|&s;ource as reading, which I &s;u&s;pect his new ac|quirements will hardly compen&s;ate. I &s;till think that half an hour pa&s;&s;ed with Mr. Addi&s;on over a <HI>Spectator,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all his fal&s;e gram|mar, or even with one of the poets, notwith|&s;tanding their infirmities, might be as well em|ployed as in weaving nets for the currant-bu&s;hes, or playing at all-fours with his hou&s;ekeeper. No man has a right to complain of the critic, who&s;e &s;agacity di&s;covers inaccuracies in a favourite au|thor, and &s;ome readers may probably be edified by &s;uch di&s;coveries; but the bulk of them, like my corre&s;pondent Ru&s;ticus, will get nothing but di&s;gu&s;t by the information: Every man's work is fair game for the critic; but let the critic beware that his own production is not open to retaliation. As for our late ingenious bio|grapher of the poets, when I compare his life of Savage with that of Gray, I mu&s;t own he has exalted the low, and brought down the lofty;
<PB N="191" REF="202">
with what ju&s;tice he has done this the world mu&s;t judge. On the part of our authors now living, whom the learned gentleman in the letter condemns in the lump, I have only this to ob|&s;erve, that the wor&s;e they fare now, the better they will &s;ucceed with po&s;terity; for the critics love the &s;port too well to hunt any but tho&s;e, who can &s;tand a good chace; and authors are the only objects in nature, which are magnified by di&s;tance and dimini&s;hed by approach: Let the illu&s;trious dead change places with the illu&s;trious living, and they &s;hall e&s;cape no better than they have done who make room for them; the more merit they bring among&s;t us, the heavier the tax they &s;hall pay for it.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e for a moment that Shake&s;pear was now an untried poet, and opened his career with any one of his be&s;t plays: The next morning u&s;hers into the world the following, or &s;omething like the following, critique.</P>

<P>La&s;t night was pre&s;ented for the fir&s;t time a tragedy called <HI>Othello or the Moor of Venice,</HI> avowedly the production of <HI>Mr. William Shake&s;pear,</HI> the actor.

In this la&s;t reply we agree with Mr. Shake|&s;pear that <HI>'tis nothing,</HI> and our philo&s;ophy tells us <HI>ex nihilo nihil fit.</HI></P>
<P>For the plot of this tragedy the mo&s;t we can &s;ay is, that it is certainly of the <HI>moving</HI> &s;ort, for it is here and there and every where; a kind of theatrical <HI>hocus-pocus</HI>; a creature of the pye-ball breed, like Jacob's muttons, be|tween a black ram and a white ewe. It brought to our mind the children's game of &mdash; <HI>I love my love with an A</HI>&mdash;with this difference only, that the young lady in this play loves her love with a B, <HI>becau&s;e he is black.&mdash;Ri&s;um teneatis?</HI></P>
<P>There is one <HI>Iago,</HI> a bloody-minded fellow, who &s;tabs men in the dark behind their backs; now this is a thing we hold to be mo&s;t vile
<PB N="193" REF="204">
and ever-to-be abhorred. Othello &s;mothers his white wife in bed; our readers may think this a &s;habby kind of an action for a general of his high calling; but we beg leave to ob|&s;erve that it &s;hews &s;ome &s;pirit at lea&s;t in Othello to attack the enemy in her <HI>&s;trong quarters</HI> at once. There was an incident of a <HI>pocket-handkerchief,</HI> which <HI>Othello</HI> called out for mo&s;t lu&s;tily, and we were rather &s;orry that his lady could not produce it, as we might then have &s;een one <HI>handkerchief</HI> at lea&s;t employed in the tragedy. There were &s;ome <HI>vernacular</HI> phra&s;es, which caught our ear, &s;uch as where the black damns his wife twice in a breath&mdash;<HI>Oh damn her, damn her!</HI>&mdash;which we thought &s;avoured more of the language &s;poken <HI>at</HI> the doors, than <HI>within</HI> the doors of the theatre; but when we recollect that the author u&s;ed to amu&s;e a lei&s;ure hour with calling up gentlemen's coaches after the play was over, before he was promoted to take a part in it, we could readily account for old habits. Tho' we have &s;een many gentlemen and ladies kill them&s;elves on the &s;tage, yet we mu&s;t give the author credit for the new way in which his hero puts him&s;elf out of the world: Othello, having &s;mothered his wife, and being taken up by the officers of the &s;tate, prepares to di&s;patch
<PB N="194" REF="205">
him&s;elf and e&s;cape from the hands of ju&s;tice; to bring this about, he begins a &s;tory about his killing a man in Aleppo, which he illu&s;trates <HI>par example</HI> by &s;tabbing him&s;elf, and &s;o winds up his &s;tory and his life in the &s;ame moment. The author made his appearance in the per&s;on of one <HI>Brabantio</HI> an old man, who makes his fir&s;t entry from a window; this occa&s;ioned &s;ome ri&s;ibility in the audience: The part is of an inferior kind, and Mr. Shake&s;pear was more indebted to the exertions of his brethren, than to his own, for carrying his play through. Upon the whole, we do not think the pa&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y, on which the plot turns, &s;o proper for tragedy as comedy, and we would recom|mend to the author, if his piece &s;urvives its nine nights, to cut it down to a farce and &s;erve it up to the public <HI>cum mic&acirc; &s;alis</HI> in that &s;hape. After this &s;pecimen of Mr. William Shake&s;pear's tragic powers, we cannot encou|rage him to pur&s;ue his attempts upon Mel|pomene; for there is a good old proverb, which we would advi&s;e him to bear in mind&mdash;<HI>ne &s;utor ultra crepidam</HI>&mdash;If he applies to his friend <HI>Ben,</HI> he will turn it into Engli&s;h for him.</P>

<P>THE conduct of a young lady, who is the only daughter of a very worthy fa|ther, and &s;ome alarming particulars re&s;pecting her &s;ituation which had come to my knowledge, gave occa&s;ion to me for writing my Paper, N^o XLVI. in which I endeavour to point out the con&s;equences parents have to apprehend from novels, which, though written upon moral plans, may be apt to take too &s;trong a hold upon young and &s;u&s;ceptible minds, e&s;pecially in the &s;ofter &s;ex, and produce an affected character, where we wi&s;h to find a natural one.</P>
<P>As the young per&s;on in que&s;tion is now happily extricated from all danger, and has &s;een her error, I &s;hall relate her &s;tory, not only as it contains &s;ome incidents which are amu&s;ing, but as it tends to illu&s;trate by example the &s;e|veral in&s;tructions, which in my Paper before mentioned I endeavoured to convey.</P>
<P><HI>Sappho</HI> is the only child of <HI>Clemens,</HI> who is a widower; a pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s for this daughter, tempered with a very &s;mall &s;hare of ob&s;ervation or knowledge of the world, determined Clemens to an attempt (which has &s;eldom been found to
<PB N="196" REF="207">
&s;ucceed) of rendering Sappho a miracle of ac|compli&s;hments, by putting her under the in|&s;tructions of ma&s;ters in almo&s;t every art and &s;cience at one and the &s;ame time: His hou&s;e now became an academy of mu&s;icians, danc|ing-ma&s;ters, language-ma&s;ters, drawing-ma&s;ters, geographers, hi&s;torians, and a variety of infe|rior arti&s;ts male and female; all the&s;e &s;tudies appeared the more de&s;irable to Clemens, from his own ignorance of them, having devoted his life to bu&s;ine&s;s of a very different nature. Sappho made ju&s;t as much progre&s;s in each, as is u&s;ual with young ladies &s;o attended; &s;he could do a little of mo&s;t of them, and talk of all: She could play a concerto by heart with every grace her ma&s;ter had taught her, note for note, with the preci&s;e repetition of a barrel|organ: She had &s;tuck the room round with drawings, which Clemens prai&s;ed to the &s;kies, and which Sappho a&s;&s;ured him had been only <HI>touched up a little</HI> by her ma&s;ter: She could tell the capital of every country, when he que&s;tioned her out of the new&s;paper, and would point out the very &s;pot upon the terre&s;trial globe, where Paris, Madrid, Naples and Con&s;tantinople ac|tually were to be found: She had as much French as puzzled Clemens, and would have &s;erved her to buy blonde-lace and Paris netting
<PB N="197" REF="208">
at a French milliner's; nay, &s;he had gone &s;o far as to pen a letter in that language to a young lady of her acquaintance, which her ma&s;ter, who &s;tood over her whil&s;t &s;he wrote it, declared to be little inferior in &s;tile to Madame Sevign&eacute;'s: In hi&s;tory, both antient and modern, her progre&s;s was proportionable; for &s;he could run through the twelve Cae&s;ars in a breath, and reckon up all the kings from the conque&s;t upon her fingers without putting one out of place; this appeared a prodigy to Clemens, and in the warmth of his heart he fairly told her &s;he was one of the world's wonders; Sappho aptly &s;et him right in this mi&s;take, by a&s;&s;uring him that there were but &s;even wonders in the world, all of which &s;he repeated to him, and only left him more convinced that &s;he her&s;elf was de&s;ervedly the eighth.</P>
<P>There was a gentleman about fifty years old, a friend of Clemens, who came frequently to his hou&s;e, and, being a man of talents and lei|&s;ure, was &s;o kind as to take great pains in di|recting and bringing Sappho forward in her &s;tudies: This was a very acceptable &s;ervice to Clemens, and the vi&s;its of <HI>Mu&s;idorus</HI> were al|ways joyfully welcomed both by him and Sappho her&s;elf: Mu&s;idorus declared him&s;elf overpaid by the delight it gave him to contem|plate
<PB N="198" REF="209">
the opening talents of &s;o promi&s;ing a young lady; and as Sappho was now of years to e&s;tabli&s;h her preten&s;ions to ta&s;te and &s;enti|ment, Mu&s;idorus made &s;uch a &s;election of au|thors for her reading, as were be&s;t calculated to accompli&s;h her in tho&s;e particulars: In &s;ettling this important choice, he was careful to put none but writers of delicacy and &s;en&s;ibility into her hands; intere&s;ting and affecting tales or novels were the books he chiefly recommended, which by exhibiting the faire&s;t patterns of female purity (&s;uffering di&s;tre&s;s and even death it&s;elf from the attacks of licentious pa&s;&s;ion in the gro&s;&s;er &s;ex) might in&s;pire her &s;ympathetic heart with pity, and guard it from &s;eduction by di&s;|playing profligacy in its mo&s;t odious colours.</P>
<P>Sappho's propen&s;ity to the&s;e &s;tudies fully an&s;wered the intentions of her kind director, and &s;he became more and more attached to works of &s;entiment and pathos. Mu&s;idorus's next &s;olicitude was to form her &s;tile, and with this view he took upon him&s;elf the trouble of carrying on a kind of probationary corre&s;pon|dence with her; this happy expedient &s;ucceeded beyond expectation, for as two people, who &s;aw each other every day, could have very little matter to write upon, there was &s;o much the more exerci&s;e for invention; and &s;uch was
<PB N="199" REF="210">
the copiou&s;ne&s;s and fluency of expre&s;&s;ion which &s;he became mi&s;tre&s;s of by this ingenious prac|tice, that &s;he could fill four &s;ides of letter paper with what other people expre&s;s upon the back of a card: Clemens once, in the exultation of his heart, put a bundle of the&s;e manu&s;cripts into my hands, which he confe&s;&s;ed he did not clearly under&s;tand, but neverthele&s;s believed them to be the mo&s;t elegant things in the lan|guage; I &s;hall give the reader a &s;ample of two of them, which I drew out of the number, not by choice, but by chance; they were carefully folded, and labelled at the back in Sappho's own hand as follows, <HI>Mu&s;idorus to Sappho of the</HI> 10<HI>th of June</HI>; underneath &s;he had wrote with a pencil the&s;e words:

<HEAD>SAPPHO IN REPLY TO MUSIDORUS.</HEAD>
<P>If nature holds her cour&s;e till Sappho for|feits her word to Mu&s;idorus, neither the &s;etting nor the ri&s;ing &s;un &s;hall vary from his appointed time. But why does Mu&s;idorus a&s;cribe to me &s;o flattering an influence, when, if I have any intere&s;t with Apollo, it mu&s;t be to his good offices only that I owe it? If he bears the me&s;&s;ages of Mu&s;idorus to me, is it not a mark of his re&s;pect to the per&s;on who &s;ends him, rather than to her he is &s;ent to? And whom &s;hould he &s;o willingly obey, as one whom he &s;o copiou&s;ly in&s;pires?

to wait upon us in our evening ramble, be|lieve me he will not &s;top for the unworthy purpo&s;e of looking back upon Sappho, but for the nobler gratification of li&s;tening to Mu&s;idorus.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The evening walk took place as u&s;ual, but it was a walk in the du&s;ty purlieus of London, and Sappho &s;ighed for a cottage and the coun|try: Mu&s;idorus &s;econded the &s;igh, and he had abundance of fine things to &s;ay on the occa&s;ion: Retirement is a charming &s;ubject for a &s;enti|mental enthu&s;ia&s;t; there is not a poet in the language, but will help him out with a de&s;crip|tion; Mu&s;idorus had them all at his fingers ends, from <HI>He&s;perus that led the &s;tarry ho&s;t,</HI> down to a glow-worm.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion took &s;o &s;trong a hold of Sappho's mind, that &s;he actually a&s;&s;ailed her father on the &s;ubject, and with great energy of per&s;ua&s;ion moved him to adopt her ideas: It did not exactly &s;uit Clemens to break up a very lucra|tive profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;et out in &s;earch of &s;ome &s;olitary cottage, who&s;e romantic &s;ituation might &s;uit the &s;piritualized de&s;ires of his daughter, and I am afraid he was for once in his life not quite &s;o re&s;pectful to her wi&s;hes, as he might have been: Sappho was &s;o unu&s;ed to contra|diction,
<PB N="203" REF="214">
that &s;he explained her&s;elf to Mu&s;idorus with &s;ome a&s;perity, and it became the &s;ubject of much debate between them: Not that he held a contrary opinion from her's; but the difficulty which embarra&s;&s;ed both parties was, where to find the happy &s;cene &s;he &s;ighed for, and how to obtain it when it was found. The fir&s;t part of this difficulty was at la&s;t &s;urmount|ed, and the cho&s;en &s;pot was pointed out by Mu&s;idorus, which according to his de&s;cription was the very bower of felicity; it was in a northern county at a di&s;tance from the capital, and its &s;ituation was mo&s;t delectable: The next mea&s;ure was a &s;trong one; for the que&s;tion to be decided was, if Sappho &s;hould abandon her project or her father; &s;he called upon Mu&s;i|dorus for his opinion, and he delivered it as follows:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If I was not convinced, mo&s;t ami|able Sappho, that a &s;econd application to Clemens would be as un&s;ucce&s;sful as the fir&s;t, I would advi&s;e you to the experiment; but as there is no doubt of this, it mu&s;t be the heighth of imprudence to put that to a trial, of which there is no hope: It comes there|fore next to be con&s;idered, if you &s;hall give up your plan, or execute it without his pri|vity; in other words, if you &s;hall or &s;hall not do that, which is to make you happy:
<PB N="204" REF="215">
If it were not con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;t purity of character, I &s;hould an&s;wer no; but when I reflect upon the innocence, the &s;im|plicity, the moral beauty of the choice you make, I then regard the duty you owe to your&s;elf as &s;uperior to all others, which are fal&s;ely called natural; whereas, if you follow this in preference, you obey nature her&s;elf: If you were of an age too childi&s;h to be al|lowed to know what &s;uits you be&s;t, or, if being old enough to be intitled to a choice, you wanted wit to make one, there would be no doubt in the ca&s;e; nay, I will go &s;o far as to &s;ay, that if Clemens was a man of judg|ment &s;uperior to your own, I &s;hould be &s;taggered with his oppo&s;ition; but if truth may ever be &s;poken, it may on this occa&s;ion, and who is there that does not &s;ee the weak|ne&s;s of the father's under&s;tanding; who but mu&s;t acknowledge the pre-eminence of the daughter's? I will &s;peak yet plainer, mo&s;t incomparable Sappho, it is not fitting that folly &s;hould pre&s;cribe to wi&s;dom: The que&s;|tion therefore is come to an up&s;hot, Shall Sappho live a life &s;he de&s;pi&s;es and dete&s;ts, to humour a father, who&s;e weakne&s;s &s;he pities, but who&s;e judgment &s;he cannot re&s;pect?"</Q></P>

<P>The hou&s;e, in which &s;he had taken &s;helter, was of the meane&s;t &s;ort, but the good people were humane and a&s;&s;iduous, and the village af|forded a medical a&s;&s;i&s;tant of no contemptible &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion: There was another con&s;olation attended her &s;ituation, for in the &s;ame inn was quartered a dragoon officer with a &s;mall recruit|ing party; this young cornet was of a good fa|mily, of an engaging per&s;on and very elegant addre&s;s; his humanity was exerted not only in con&s;oling Sappho, but in nur&s;ing and cheering Mu&s;idorus. The&s;e charitable offices were per|formed with &s;uch a natural benignity, that Sap|pho mu&s;t have been mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible if &s;he could have overlooked them; her gentle heart on the

contrary overflowed with gratitude, and in the extremity of her di&s;tre&s;s &s;he freely confe&s;&s;ed to him, that but for his &s;upport &s;he mu&s;t have &s;unk outright. Though the extremity of Mu&s;idorus's danger was now over, yet he was incapable of exertion; and Sappho, who was at lei&s;ure to re|flect upon her &s;ituation, began to waver in her re&s;olution, and to put &s;ome que&s;tions to her&s;elf, which rea&s;on could not readily an&s;wer. Her thoughts were &s;o di&s;tracted and perplexed, that &s;he &s;aw no re&s;ource but to unburthen them, and throw her&s;elf upon the honour and di&s;cretion of Lionel, for &s;o this young officer was called. This &s;he had frequently in mind to do, and many opportunities offered them&s;elves for it, but &s;till her &s;en&s;ibility of &s;hame prevented it. The con&s;tant apprehen&s;ion of pur&s;uit hung over her, and &s;ometimes &s;he meditated to go back to her father; in one of the&s;e moments &s;he had begun to write a letter to Clemens to prepare him for her return, when Lionel entered the room and in|formed her that he perceived &s;o vi&s;ible an amend|ment in Mu&s;idorus, that he expected to congra|tulate her on his recovery in a very few days&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"and then, Madam,"</Q> added he,

<P>Whil&s;t Lionel was uttering the&s;e words, his action, his emotion, and that hone&s;t glow of pa&s;&s;ion, which nature only can a&s;&s;ume and arti|fice cannot counterfeit, had &s;o &s;ubdued the yield|ing heart of Sappho, that he mu&s;t have been dull indeed, if he could have wanted any &s;tronger confirmation of his &s;ucce&s;s, than what her looks be&s;towed: Never was &s;ilence more eloquent; the labour of language and the forms of law had no &s;hare in this contract: A &s;igh of &s;peechle&s;s ec&s;ta&s;y drew up the nuptial bond; the operations of love are momentary: Tears of affection in|terchangeably

<P>Every moment now had wings to waft them to that happy &s;pot, where the unholy hand of law has not yet plucked up the root of love: Freedom met them on the very extremity of her pre|cincts; Nature held out her hand to welcome them, and the Loves and Graces, though exiled to a de&s;art, danced in her train.</P>
<P>Thus was Sappho, when brought to the very brink of de&s;truction, re&s;cued by the happy inter|vention of Providence. The next day produced an interview with Clemens, at the hou&s;e to which they returned after the ceremony in Scot|land: The meeting, as might well be expected, was poignant and reproachful; but when Sappho, in place of a &s;uperannuated &s;entimentali&s;t, pre|&s;ented to him a &s;on-in-law, in who&s;e martial form and countenance he beheld youth, honour, manly beauty, and every attractive grace that could ju&s;tify her choice, his tran&s;ports became exce&s;&s;ive; and their union, being now &s;anctified by the ble&s;&s;ing of a father, and warranted by love and nature, has &s;natched a deluded victim from mi&s;ery and error, and added one conjugal in|&s;tance to the &s;canty records of unfa&s;hionable felicity.</P>

<P>THE dei&s;tical writers, who would fain per|&s;uade us that the world was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of as pure a &s;y&s;tem of morality before the intro|duction of Chri&s;tianity as &s;ince, affect to make a great di&s;play of the virtues of many eminent heathens, particularly of the philo&s;ophers So|crates, Plato, and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>When they &s;et up the&s;e characters as examples of perfection, which human nature with the aids of revelation either has not attained to, or not exceeded, they put us upon an invidious ta&s;k, which no man would voluntarily engage in, and
<PB N="217" REF="228">
challenge us to di&s;cu&s;s a que&s;tion, which, if tho|roughly agitated, cannot fail to &s;trip the illu&s;tri|ous dead of more than half the honours which the voice of ages has agreed to give them.</P>
<P>It is therefore to be wi&s;hed that they had held the argument to its general terms, and &s;hewn us where that &s;y&s;tem of ethics is to be found, which they are prepared to bring into compari&s;on with the moral doctrines of Chri&s;t. This I take to be the fair ground whereon the controver&s;y &s;hould have been decided, and here it would in|fallibly have been brought to i&s;&s;ue; but they knew their weapons better than to tru&s;t them in &s;o clo&s;e a conflict.</P>
<P>The maxims of &s;ome heathen philo&s;ophers, and the moral writings of Plato, Cicero and Seneca, contain many noble truths, worthy to be held in veneration by po&s;terity; and if the dei&s;t can from the&s;e produce a &s;y&s;tem of morality as pure and perfect as that which claims its origin from divine revelation, he will prove that God gave to man a faculty of di&s;tingui&s;hing between right and wrong with &s;uch correctne&s;s, that his own immediate revelation added no lights to tho&s;e, which the powers of rea&s;on had already di&s;cover|ed. Let us grant therefore for a moment, that Chri&s;t's religion revealed to the world no new truths in morality, nor removed any old errors,
<PB N="218" REF="229">
and what triumph accrues to the dei&s;t by the ad|mi&s;&s;ion? The mo&s;t he gains is to bring rea&s;on to a level with revelation, as to its moral doc|trines; in &s;o doing he dignifies man's nature, and &s;hews how excellent a faculty God gave his creatures in their original formation, to guide their judgments and controul their actions; but will this dimini&s;h the importance of revealed religion? Certainly not, unle&s;s he can prove one or both of the following po&s;itions; viz.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the moral tenets of Chri&s;tianity either fall &s;hort of, or run counter to, the moral tenets of natural religion; or,</P>
<P>Secondly, That Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion was nugatory and &s;uperfluous, becau&s;e the world was already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of as good a &s;y&s;tem of morality as he imparted to mankind.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, I believe it has never been at|tempted by any heathen or dei&s;tical advocate to convict the Go&s;pel &s;y&s;tem of fal&s;e morality, or to alledge that it is &s;hort and defective in any one particular duty, when compared with that &s;y&s;tem which the world was po&s;&s;e&s;t of without its aid. No man, I believe, has controverted its truths, though many have di&s;puted its di&s;coveries: No man has been hardy enough to &s;ay of any of its doctrines&mdash;<HI>This we ought not to practi&s;e</HI>; though many have been vain enough to cry out&mdash;<HI>All</HI>
<PB N="219" REF="230">
<HI>this we knew before.</HI>&mdash;Let us leave this po&s;ition therefore for the pre&s;ent, and pa&s;s to the next, viz. Whether Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion was nugatory and &s;uperfluous, becau&s;e the world already knew as much morality as he taught them.</P>
<P>This will at once be an&s;wered, if the Go&s;pel a&s;&s;ertion be e&s;tabli&s;hed, that life and immortality were brought to light. We need not adduce any other of the my&s;teries of revelation; we may &s;afely re&s;t the que&s;tion here, and &s;ay with the apo&s;tle to the Gentile world&mdash;<HI>Behold! I &s;hew you a my&s;tery: We &s;hall not all &s;leep, but we &s;hall all be changed; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the la&s;t trump (for the trumpet &s;hall &s;ound) and the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed incorruptible, and we &s;hall be changed.</HI> Mark to how &s;hort an i&s;&s;ue the argument is now brought! Either the apo&s;tle is not warranted in calling this a <HI>my&s;tery,</HI> or the dei&s;t is not warranted in calling Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion nugatory and &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>It now re&s;ts with the dei&s;t to produce from the writings and opinions of mankind antecedent to Chri&s;tianity, &s;uch a revelation of things to come, as can fully anticipate the Go&s;pel revela|tion, or el&s;e to admit with the apo&s;tle that <HI>a my&s;tery was &s;hewn</HI>; and if the importance of this <HI>my&s;tery</HI> be admitted, as it &s;urely mu&s;t, the im|portance of Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion can no longer be

di&s;puted; and though revelation &s;hall have added nothing to the heathen &s;y&s;tem of morality, &s;till it does not follow that it was &s;uperfluous and nugatory.</P>

What does it avail, though Seneca had taught as good morality as Chri&s;t him&s;elf preached from the Mount? How does it affect revealed religion, though Tully's Offices were found &s;uperior to Saint Paul's Epi&s;tles?

<P>When we con&s;ider the ages, which have elap&s;ed &s;ince the introduction of Chri&s;tianity, and the events attending its propagation, how wonderful is the hi&s;tory we contemplate! We &s;ee a mighty light &s;preading over all mankind from one &s;park kindled in an ob&s;cure corner of the earth: An humble per&s;ecuted teacher preaches a religion of peace, of forgivene&s;s of injuries, of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to temporal autho|rities, of meekne&s;s, piety, brotherly love and univer&s;al benevolence; he is tried, condemned and executed for his doctrines; he ri&s;es from the tomb, and, breaking down the doors of death, &s;ets open to all mankind the evidence of a life to come, and at the &s;ame time points out the &s;ure path to everla&s;ting happine&s;s in that future &s;tate: A few unlettered di&s;ciples, his adherents and &s;urvivors, take up his doctrines, and going forth among&s;t the provinces of the Roman empire, then in its zenith, preach a religion to the Gen|tiles, directly &s;triking at the foundation of the mo&s;t &s;plendid fabric Super&s;tition ever reared on earth: The&s;e Gentiles are not a rude and bar|barous race, but men of illuminated minds, acute philo&s;ophers, eloquent orators, powerful rea&s;oners, eminent in arts and &s;ciences, and

Now when the mind of any man is endued with a fine na|tural ta&s;te, and all means of profiting by other men's ideas are out of the que&s;tion, that ta&s;te will operate by di&s;po&s;ing him to &s;elect the faire&s;t &s;ubjects out of what he &s;ees either for art or imagination to work upon: Still his production will be marked with &s;implicity; but as it is the province of ta&s;te to &s;eparate deformity or vulgarity from what is merely &s;imple, &s;o accord|ing to the nature of his mind who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, beauty or &s;ublimity will be the re&s;ult of the operation: If his ta&s;te inclines him to what is fair and elegant in nature, he will produce beauty; if to what is lofty, bold and tremen|dous, he will &s;trike out &s;ublimity.</P>

As Apollo is made ho&s;tile to the Greeks, and the cau&s;e of his offence is introduced by Homer in the opening of the Iliad, &s;o Juno in the Aeneid &s;tands in his place with every cir|cum&s;tance of imitation. It would be an end|le&s;s ta&s;k to trace the various in&s;tances through|out the Aeneid, where &s;carce a &s;ingle incident can be found which is not copied from Homer:
<PB N="227" REF="238">
Neither is there greater originality in the executive parts of the poem, than in the con|&s;tructive; with this difference only, that he has copied pa&s;&s;ages from various authors, Roman as well as Greek, though from Homer the mo&s;t. Among&s;t the Greeks, the dramatic poets Ae&s;|chylus, Sophocles, and principally Euripides; have had the greate&s;t &s;hare of his attention; Ari&s;to|phanes, Menander and other comic authors, Callimachus and &s;ome of the lyric writers, al&s;o may be traced in his imitations. A va&s;t col|lection of pa&s;&s;ages from Ennius chiefly, from Lucretius, Furius, Lucilius, Pacuvius, Suevius, Naevius, Varius, Catullus, Accius and others of his own nation, has been made by Macro|bius in his <HI>Saturnalia,</HI> where Virgil has done little el&s;e but put their &s;entiments into more elegant ver&s;e; &s;o that in &s;trictne&s;s of &s;peaking we may &s;ay of the Aeneid,
<Q REND="inline">"that it is a mi&s;|cellaneous compilation of poetical pa&s;&s;ages, compo&s;ing all together an epic poem, formed upon the model of Homer's Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey; abounding in beautiful ver&s;ification, and ju&s;tly to be admired for the fine <HI>acquired ta&s;te</HI> of its author, but devoid of originality either of con&s;truction or execution."</Q>
Be&s;ides its ge|neral inferiority as being a copy from Homer, it particularly falls off from its original in the

conception and pre&s;ervation of character: It does not reach the &s;ublimity and maje&s;ty of its model, but it has in a great degree adopted the &s;implicity, and entirely avoided the ru&s;ticity of Homer.</P>
<P>Lucan and Claudian in later ages were per|haps as good ver&s;ifiers as Virgil, but far in|ferior to him in that fine acquired ta&s;te, which he excelled in: They are ingenious, but not &s;imple; and execute better than they contrive. A pa&s;&s;age from Claudian, which I &s;hall beg the reader's leave to compare with one from Virgil (where he per&s;onifies the evil pa&s;&s;ions and plagues of mankind, and po&s;ts them at the entrance of hell, to which Aeneas is de&s;cending) will ex|emplify what I have &s;aid; for at the &s;ame time that it will bear a di&s;pute, whether Clau|dian's de&s;cription is not even &s;uperior to Virgil's in poetical merit, yet the judicious manner of introducing it in one ca&s;e, and the evident want of judgment in the other, will help to &s;hew, that the rea&s;on why we prefer Virgil to Claudian, is more on account of his &s;uperiority of ta&s;te than of talents.</P>
<P>Claudian's de&s;cription &s;tands in the very front of his poem on Ruffinus; Virgil's is woven into his fable, and will be found in the &s;ixth book of his Aeneid, as follows:</P>

<P>The productions of the human genius will borrow their complexion from the times in which they originate.

My an&s;wer hath been</HI> (adds he) <HI>Would he had blotted out a thou&s;and! which they thought a malevolent &s;peech. I had not told po&s;terity this, but for their ignorance, who cho&s;e that circum&s;tance to commend their friend by, wherein he mo&s;t faulted; and to ju&s;tify mine own candour, for I loved the</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="242">
<HI>man, and do honour his memory on this &s;ide ido|latry as much as any: He was indeed hone&s;t, and of an open and free nature; had an excellent phanta&s;ie, brave notions and gentle expre&s;&s;ions, wherein he flowed with that facility, that &s;ome|time it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be &s;topped</HI>; Suf|flaminandus erat, <HI>as Augu&s;tus &s;aid of Haterius: His wit was in his own power; would the rule of it had been &s;o too!</HI></P>
<P>I think there can be no doubt but this kind of indignant negligence with which Shake&s;pear wrote, was greatly owing to the &s;light con&s;i|deration he had for his audience. Jon&s;on treated them with the dictatorial haughtine&s;s of a pedant; Shake&s;pear with the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of a gentleman who wrote at his ea&s;e, and gave them the fir&s;t flowings of his fancy with|out any dread of their correction. The&s;e were times in which the poet indulged his genius without re&s;traint; he &s;tood alone and &s;uper|eminent, and wanted no artificial &s;caffold to rai&s;e him above the heads of his contempora|ries; he was natural, lofty, carele&s;s, and daringly incorrect. Place the &s;ame man in other times, among&s;t a people poli&s;hed almo&s;t into general equality, and he &s;hall begin to he&s;itate and re|tract his &s;allies; for in this re&s;pect poetical are like military excur&s;ions, and it makes a wide

difference in the movements of a &s;kilful general, whether he is to &s;ally into a country defended by well-di&s;ciplined troops, or only by an irre|gular mob of unarmed barbarians. Shake&s;pear might vault his Pega&s;us without a rein; moun|tains might ri&s;e and &s;eas roll in vain before him; Nature her&s;elf could neither &s;top nor circum&s;cribe his career. The modern man of ver&s;e mounts with the precaution of a riding-ma&s;ter, and prances round his little circle full-bitted and capari&s;oned in all the formality of a review. Whil&s;t he is thus pacing and <HI>piaffering</HI> with every body's eyes upon him, his friends are calling out every now and then&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Seat your|&s;elf firm in the &s;addle!

<P>I WAS in company the other day with a young gentleman, who had newly &s;ucceeded to a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, and was a good deal &s;truck with the conver&s;ation of an elderly per&s;on pre&s;ent, who was very deliberately ca&s;ting up the &s;everal demands that the community at large had upon his property.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Are you aware,"</Q> &s;ays he,

Part of your income will be &s;topt for the maintenance of them who have none, under the denomination of poor|rates; this may be called a fine upon the par|tiality
<PB N="234" REF="245">
of fortune, levied by the law of &s;ociety, which will not tru&s;t its poor members to the precarious charity of the rich: Another part mu&s;t go to the debts and nece&s;&s;ities of the go|vernment, which protects you in war and peace, and is al&s;o a fine, which you mu&s;t be content to pay for the honour of being an Engli&s;hman, and the advantage of living in a land of liberty and &s;ecurity. The learned profe&s;&s;ions will al&s;o have their &s;hare; the church for taking care of your &s;oul, the phy|&s;ician for looking after your body, and the lawyer mu&s;t have part of your property for &s;uperintending the re&s;t. The merchant, trade&s;|man and arti&s;an will have their profit upon all the multiplied wants, comforts and indulgen|ces of civilized life; the&s;e are not to be enu|merated, for they depend on the humours and habits of men; they have grown up with the refinements and elegancies of the age, and they will further encrea&s;e, as the&s;e &s;hall advance: They are the conductors, which, like the blood-ve&s;&s;els in the human frame, cir|culate your wealth, and every other man's wealth, through every limb and even fibre of the national body: The hand of indu&s;try creates that wealth, and to the hand of
<PB N="235" REF="246">
indu&s;try it finally returns, as blood does to the heart."</Q></P>
<P>If we trace the &s;ituation of man from a mere &s;tate of nature to the highe&s;t &s;tate of civilization, we &s;hall find the&s;e artificial wants and dependen|ces encrea&s;e with every &s;tage and degree of his improvements; &s;o that if we con&s;ider each na|tion apart as one great machine, the &s;everal parts and &s;prings, which give it motion, naturally be|come more and more complicated and multifari|ous, as the u&s;es to which it is applied are more and more diver&s;ified. Again, if we compare two nations in an equal &s;tate of civilization, we may remark, that where the greater freedom ob|tains, there the greater variety of artificial wants will obtain al&s;o, and of cour&s;e property will cir|culate through more channels: This I take to be the ca&s;e upon a compari&s;on between France and England, ari&s;ing from the different con&s;titutions of them and us with re&s;pect to civil liberty.</P>
<P>The natural wants of men are pretty much the &s;ame in mo&s;t &s;tates, but the humours of men will take different directions in different coun|tries, and are governed in a great degree by the laws and con&s;titution of the realm in which they are found: There are numbers of people in England, who get their living by arts and occu|pations, which would not be tolerated in a de|&s;potic
<PB N="236" REF="247">
government. Men's manners are &s;impli|fied in proportion to the re&s;traint and circum|&s;cription under which they are kept. The coun|try &s;ports of Engli&s;h gentlemen furni&s;h mainte|nance and employment to va&s;t numbers of our people, whereas in France and other arbitrary &s;tates, men of the fir&s;t rank and fortune re&s;ide in the capital, and keep no e&s;tabli&s;hments of this &s;ort. What a train of grooms, jockies and &s;table-boys follow the heels of our hor&s;es and hounds in tight boots and leather breeches! each of which carries the clothes of &s;ix men upon his back, ca&s;ed in one &s;kin of flannel under another, like the coats of an onion. The loco|motive mania of an Engli&s;hman circulates his per&s;on, and of cour&s;e his ca&s;h, into every quarter of the kingdom: A Frenchman takes a journey only when he cannot help it, an Engli&s;hman has no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e he likes it; he moves with every &s;hift of the weather, and fol|lows the changes of the mo&s;t variable climate in the world; a fro&s;ty morning puts him from his hunting, and he is in London before night; a thaw meets him in town, and again he &s;campers into the country: He has a hor&s;e to run at Ep&s;om, another at Sali&s;bury, and a third at York, and he mu&s;t be on the &s;pot to back every one of them; he has a &s;tud at Newmarket, a mi&s;tre&s;s in Lon|don,
<PB N="237" REF="248">
a &s;hooting-box in Norfolk, and a pack of fox-hounds in the New Fore&s;t: For one wheel that real bu&s;ine&s;s puts in motion, plea&s;ure, whim, <HI>ennui</HI> turn one hundred: Sickne&s;s, which con+fines all the re&s;t of the world, &s;ends him upon his travels; one doctor plunges him into the &s;ea at Brighthelm&s;tone, a &s;econd &s;teeps him in warm water at Buxton; and a third &s;ends him to Bath; for the gentlemen of the learned faculty, whether they help us into life, or help us out of it, make us pay toll at each gate; and if at any time their art keeps us alive, the fine we mu&s;t pay to their ingenuity makes the renewal in &s;ome ca&s;es too hard a bargain for a poor man to profit by. In all other countries upon earth a man is content|ed to be well and pay nothing for being &s;o, but in England even health is an expen&s;ive article, as we are for ever contriving how to be a little better, and phy&s;icians are too con&s;cientious to take a fee and do nothing for it. If there is any th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">g like ridicule in this, it is again&s;t the pa|tient and not again&s;t the phy&s;ician I would wi&s;h to point it; it is in England that the profe&s;&s;ion is truly dignified, and if it is here accompanied with greater emoluments, it is proportionably practi&s;ed with &s;uperior learning; if life is more valuable in a land of freedom than in a land of &s;lavery, why &s;hould it not be paid for ac|cording
<PB N="238" REF="249">
to its value? In de&s;potic &s;tates, where men's lives are in fact the property of the prince, all &s;ubjects &s;hould in ju&s;tice be cured or killed at his proper charge; but where a man's hou&s;e is his ca&s;tle, his health is his own concern.</P>
<P>As to the other learned profe&s;&s;ion of the law, to its honour be it &s;poken, there is that charm|ing perplexity about it, that we can ruin one another and our&s;elves with the greate&s;t certainty and facility. It is &s;o &s;uperior to all other &s;ciences, that it can turn demon&s;tration into doubt, truth into contradiction, make improbability put mat|ter of fact out of countenance, and hang up a point for twenty years, which common &s;en&s;e would decide in as many minutes. It is the glorious privilege of the freemen of England to make their own laws, and they have made &s;o many, that they can neither count them up nor comprehend them. The parliament of England is without compari&s;on the mo&s;t voluminous au|thor in the world; and there is &s;uch a happy am|biguity in its works, that its &s;tudents have as much to &s;ay on the wrong &s;ide of every que&s;tion as upon the right: In all ca&s;es of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion it is one man's bu&s;ine&s;s to puzzle, and another's to explain, and though victory be ever &s;o certain, it is agreed between the parties to make a long battle: There mu&s;t be an extraordinary faculty
<PB N="239" REF="250">
of expre&s;&s;ion in the law, when the only parts clearly under&s;tood are tho&s;e which it has not committed to writing.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay very little in this place upon the &s;acred profe&s;&s;ion of divinity: It is to be lamented that the church of England is not provided with a proper competency for all who are engaged in performing its functions; but I cannot clo&s;e with their opinion, who are for &s;tripping its dig|nities, and equalizing tho&s;e &s;plendid benefices, which are at once the glory and the &s;upport of its e&s;tabli&s;hment. Levellers and reformers will always have the popular cry on their &s;ide, and I have good rea&s;on to know with what inveteracy a man is per&s;ecuted for an opinion which oppo&s;es it; and yet it is hard to give credit to the &s;in|cerity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of him who courts popularity, and deny it to the man who &s;acri|fices his repo&s;e and &s;tands the brunt of abu&s;e in defence of what he believes to be the truth.</P>
<P>And now having fallen upon the mention of Popularity, I &s;hall take leave to addre&s;s that divinity with a few lines picked up from an ob|&s;cure author, which, though below poetry, are not quite pro&s;e, and on that account pretty nearly &s;uited to the level of their &s;ubject.</P>

<P>WHEN it had entered into the mind of Shake&s;pear to form an hi&s;torical play upon certain events in the reign of Henry the fourth of England, the character of the Prince of Wales recommended it&s;elf to his fancy, as likely to &s;upply him with a fund of dramatic incidents; for what could invention have more happily &s;ug|ge&s;ted than this character, which hi&s;tory pre|&s;ented ready to his hands? a riotous di&s;orderly young libertine, in who&s;e nature lay hidden tho&s;e &s;eeds of heroi&s;m and ambition, which were to bur&s;t forth at once to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the world and to atchieve the conque&s;t of France. This prince, who&s;e character was de&s;tined to exhibit a revolution of &s;o brilliant a &s;ort, was not only in him&s;elf a very tempting hero for the dra|matic poet, who delights in incidents of novelty and &s;urprize, but al&s;o offered to his imagination a train of attendant characters, in the per&s;ons of his wild comrades and a&s;&s;ociates, which would be of them&s;elves a drama. Here was a field for invention wide enough even for the genius of Shake&s;pear to range in. All the humours, pa&s;|&s;ions and extravagancies of human life might be
<PB N="243" REF="254">
brought into the compo&s;ition, and when he had grouped and per&s;onified them to his ta&s;te and liking, he had a leader ready to place at the head of the train, and the truth of hi&s;tory to give life and intere&s;t to his drama.</P>
<P>With the&s;e materials ready for creation the great arti&s;t &s;ate down to his work; the canva&s;s was &s;pread before him, ample and capacious as the expan&s;e of his own fancy; nature put her pencil into his hand, and he began to &s;ketch. His fir&s;t concern was to give a chief or captain to this gang of rioters: this would naturally be the fir&s;t outline he drew. To fill up the draw|ing of this per&s;onage he conceived a voluptu|ary, in who&s;e figure and character there &s;hould be an a&s;&s;emblage of comie qualities; in his per&s;on he &s;hould be bloated and blown up to the &s;ize of a <HI>Silenus,</HI> lazy, luxurious, in &s;en&s;u|ality a &s;atyr, in intemperance a bacchanalian: As he was to &s;tand in the po&s;t of a ringleader among&s;t thieves and cutpur&s;es, he made him a notorious liar, a &s;waggering coward, vain-glori|ous, arbitrary, knavi&s;h, crafty, voracious of plunder, lavi&s;h of his gains, without credit, ho|nour or hone&s;ty, and in debt to every body about him: As he was to be the chief &s;educer and mi&s;leader of the heir apparent of the crown, it was incumbent on the poet to qualify him for
<PB N="244" REF="255">
that part in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould give proba|bility and even a plea to the temptation; this was only to be done by the &s;tronge&s;t touches and the highe&s;t colourings of a ma&s;ter; by hitting off a humour of &s;o happy, &s;o facetious and &s;o alluring a ca&s;t, as &s;hould tempt even royalty to forget it&s;elf and virtue to turn reveller in his company. His lies, his vanity and his coward|ice, too gro&s;s to deceive, were to be &s;o ingenious as to give delight; his cunning eva&s;ions, his witty re&s;ources, his mock &s;olemnity, his vapour|ing &s;elf-con&s;equence, were to furni&s;h a continual fea&s;t of laughter to his royal companion; he was not only to be witty him&s;elf, but the cau&s;e of wit in other people; a whet&s;tone for raillery; a buffoon, who&s;e very per&s;on was a je&s;t: Com|pounded of the&s;e humours, Shake&s;pear produced the character of <HI>Sir John Fal&s;taff</HI>; a character, which neither ancient nor modern comedy has ever equalled, which was &s;o much the favourite of its author as to be introduced in three &s;everal plays, and which is likely to be the idol of the Engli&s;h &s;tage, as long as it &s;hall &s;peak the language of Shake&s;pear.</P>
<P>This character almo&s;t &s;ingly &s;upports the whole comic plot of the fir&s;t part of Henry the fourth; the poet has indeed thrown in &s;ome auxiliary humours in the per&s;ons of Gad&s;hill,
<PB N="245" REF="256">
Peto, Bardolph, and Ho&s;te&s;s Quickly; the two fir&s;t &s;erve for little el&s;e except to fill up the action, but Bardolph as a butt to Fal&s;taff's rail|lery, and the ho&s;te&s;s in her wrangling &s;cene with him, when his pockets had been emptied as he was a&s;leep in the tavern, give occa&s;ion to &s;cenes of infinite plea&s;antry: Poins is contra&s;ted from the re&s;t of the gang, and as he is made the com|panion of the prince, is very properly repre&s;ented as a man of better qualities and morals than Fal&s;taff's more immediate hangers-on and de|pendants.</P>
<P>The humour of Fal&s;taff opens into full di&s;play upon his very fir&s;t introduction with the prince; the incident of the robbery on the highway, the &s;cene in Ea&s;tcheap in con&s;equence of that ridicu|lous encounter, and the whole of his conduct during the action with Percy, are &s;o exqui&s;itely plea&s;ant, that upon the renovation of his dramatic life in the &s;econd part of Henry the fourth, I que&s;tion if the humour does not in part evapo|rate by continuation; at lea&s;t I am per&s;uaded that it flattens a little in the out&s;et, and though his wit may not flow le&s;s copiou&s;ly, yet it comes with more labour and is farther fetcht. The poet &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible how difficult it was to pre&s;erve the vein as rich as at fir&s;t, and has therefore &s;trengthened his comic plot in the

&s;econd play with &s;everal new recruits, who may take a &s;hare with Fal&s;taff, to whom he no longer entru&s;ts the whole burthen of the humour. In the front of the&s;e auxiliaries &s;tands Pi&s;tol, a character &s;o new, whim&s;ical and extravagant, that if it were not for a commentator now living, who&s;e very extraordinary re&s;earches, among&s;t our old authors, have &s;upplied us with pa&s;&s;ages to illumi|nate the &s;trange rhap&s;odies which Shake&s;pear has put into his mouth, I &s;hould for one have thought Antient Pi&s;tol as wild and imaginary a being as Caliban; but I now perceive, by the help of the&s;e di&s;coveries, that the character is <HI>made up in great part of ab&s;urd and fu&s;tian pa&s;&s;ages from many plays, in which Shake&s;pear</HI> was ver&s;ed and perhaps <HI>had been a performer:</HI> Pi&s;tol's dialogue is a ti&s;&s;ue of old tags of bomba&s;t, like the middle comedy of the Greeks, which dealt in parody. I abate of my a&s;toni&s;hment at the invention and originality of the poet, but it does not le&s;&s;en my re&s;pect for his ingenuity. Shake&s;pear founded his bully in parody, Jon&s;on copied his from nature, and the palm &s;eems due to Bobadil upon a compari&s;on with Pi&s;tol; Congreve copied a very happy like|ne&s;s from Jon&s;on, and by the faire&s;t and mo&s;t laudable imitation produced his Noll Bluff, one of the plea&s;ante&s;t humouri&s;ts on the comic &s;tage.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="258">Shallow and Silence are two very &s;trong aux|iliaries to this &s;econd part of Fal&s;taff's humours, and though they do not ab&s;olutely belong to his family, they are neverthele&s;s near of kin, and derivatives from his &s;tock: Surely two plea&s;ant|er fellows never trode the &s;tage; they not only contra&s;t and play upon each other, but Silence &s;ober and Silence tip&s;ey make the mo&s;t comical rever&s;e in nature; never was drunkenne&s;s &s;o well introduced or &s;o happily employed in any drama: The dialogue between Shallow and Fal&s;taff, and the de&s;cription given by the latter of Shallow's youthful frolicks, are as true nature and as true comedy as man's invention ever produced: The recruits are al&s;o in the literal &s;en&s;e the recruits of the drama. The&s;e per&s;onages have the further merit of throwing Fal&s;taff's character into a new ca&s;t, and giving it the &s;ea&s;onable relief of va|riety.</P>
<P>Dame Quickly al&s;o in this &s;econd part re&s;umes her r&ocirc;le with great comic &s;pirit, but with &s;ome variation of character for the purpo&s;e of intro|ducing a new member into the troop in the per|&s;on of Doll Tear&s;heet, the common trull of the times. Though this part is very &s;trongly co|loured, and though the &s;cene with her and Fal|&s;taff is of a loo&s;e as well as ludicrous nature, yet if we compare Shake&s;pear's conduct of this in|cident
<PB N="248" REF="259">
with that of the dramatic writers of his time, and even &s;ince his time, we mu&s;t confe&s;s he has managed it with more than common care, and exhibited his comic hero in a very ri|diculous light, without any of tho&s;e gro&s;s inde|cencies which the poets of his age indulged them&s;elves in without re&s;traint.</P>
<P>The humour of the Prince of Wales is not &s;o free and uncon&s;trained as in the fir&s;t part; though he &s;till demeans him&s;elf in the cour&s;e of his revels, yet it is with frequent marks of repugnance and &s;elf-con&s;ideration, as becomes the conqueror of Percy, and we &s;ee his cha|racter approaching fa&s;t towards a thorough re|formation; but though we are thus prepared for the change that is to happen, when this young hero throws off the reveller and a&s;&s;umes the king, yet we are not fortified again&s;t the weakne&s;s of pity, when the di&s;appointment and bani&s;hment of Fal&s;taff takes place, and the poet executes ju&s;tice upon his inimitable delinquent, with all the rigour of an unrelenting morali&s;t. The reader or &s;pectator, who has accompanied Fal&s;taff through his dramatic &s;tory, is in debt to him for &s;o many plea&s;ant moments, that all his failings, which &s;hould have rai&s;ed contempt, have only provoked laughter, and he begins to think they are not natural to his character, but

a&s;&s;umed for his amu&s;ement. With the&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions we &s;ee him delivered over to mortifi|cation and di&s;grace, and bewail his puni&s;hment with a &s;en&s;ibility, that is only due to the &s;uffer|ings of the virtuous.</P>
<P>As it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the limits of Shake&s;pear's genius, I will not pre&s;ume to &s;ay he could not have &s;upported his humour, had he cho&s;en to have prolonged his exi&s;tence thro' the &s;ucceeding drama of Henry the Fifth; we may conclude, that no ready expedient pre|&s;ented it&s;elf to his fancy, and he was not apt to &s;pend much pains in &s;earching for &s;uch: He therefore put him to death, by which he fairly placed him out of the reach of his contempo|raries, and got rid of the trouble and difficulty of keeping him up to his original pitch, if he had attempted to carry him through a third drama, after he had removed the Prince of Wales out of his company, and &s;eated him on the throne. I cannot doubt but there were re|&s;ources in Shake&s;pear's genius, and a latitude of humour in the character of Fal&s;taff, which might have furni&s;hed &s;cenes of admirable co|medy by exhibiting him in his di&s;grace, and both Shallow and Silence would have been ac|ce&s;&s;aries to his plea&s;antry: Even the field of Agincourt, and the di&s;tre&s;s of the king's army
<PB N="250" REF="261">
before the action, had the poet thought proper to have produced Fal&s;taff on the &s;cene, might have been as fruitful in comic incidents as the battle of Shrew&s;bury; this we can readily be|lieve from the humours of Fluellen and Pi&s;tol, which he has woven into his drama; the former of whom is made to remind us of Fal&s;taff, in his dialogue with Captain Gower, when he tells him that&mdash;<HI>As Alexander is kill his friend Clytus, being in his ales and his cups, &s;o al&s;o Harry Mon|mouth, being in his right wits and his goot judge|ments, is turn away the fat Knight with the great pelly-doublet: He was full of je&s;ts and gypes and knaveries, and mocks; I am forget his name.&mdash;Sir John Fal&s;taff.&mdash;That is he.</HI>&mdash;This pa&s;|&s;age has ever given me a plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation, as it marks a regret in the poet to part with a fa|vourite character, and is a tender farewel to his memory: It is al&s;o with particular propriety that the&s;e words are put into the mouth of Fluellen, who &s;tands here as his &s;ub&s;titute, and who&s;e humour, as well as that of Nym, may be &s;aid to have ari&s;en out of the a&s;hes of Fal&s;taff.</P>

<P>OF all our dealers in &s;econd-hand wares, few bring their goods to &s;o bad a market, as tho&s;e humble wits who retail other people's worn-out jokes. A man's good &s;ayings are &s;o per&s;onally his own, and depend &s;o much upon manner and circum&s;tances, that they make a poor figure in other people's mouths, and &s;uffer even more by printing than they do by repeat|ing: It is al&s;o a very difficult thing to pen a wittici&s;m; for by the time we have adju&s;ted all the de&s;criptive arrangements of <HI>this man &s;aid,</HI> and <HI>t'other man replied,</HI> we have mi&s;erably blunted the edge of the repartee. The&s;e diffi|culties however have been happily overcome by <HI>Mr. Jo&s;eph Miller</HI> and other facetious compi|lers, who&s;e works are in general circulation, and may be heard of in mo&s;t clubs and com|panies where gentlemen meet, who love to &s;ay a good thing without the trouble of inventing it. We are al&s;o in a fair train of knowing every thing that a <HI>late celebrated author</HI> &s;aid, as well

as wrote, without an exception even of his mo&s;t &s;ecret ejaculations. We may judge how valuable the&s;e diaries will be to po&s;terity, when we reflect how much we &s;hould now be edified, had any of the antients given us as minute a <HI>collectanea</HI> of their illu&s;trious contemporaries.</P>
<P>We have, it is true, a few of <HI>Cicero</HI>'s table-jokes; but how delightful would it be to know what he &s;aid, when nobody heard him! how piou&s;ly he reproached him&s;elf when he laid in bed too late in a morning, or eat too heartily at <HI>Horten&s;ius</HI>'s or <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s table. We are told indeed that <HI>Cato the Cen&s;or</HI> loved his je&s;t, but we &s;hould have been doubly glad to have par|taken of it: What a pity it is that nobody thought it worth their while to record &s;ome plea&s;anter &s;pecimen than <HI>Macrobius</HI> has given us of his retort upon <HI>Q. Albidius,</HI> a glutton and a &s;pendthrift, when his hou&s;e was on fire&mdash;<HI>What he could not eat, he has burnt,</HI> &s;aid Cato; where the point of the je&s;t lies in the allu&s;ion to a par|ticular kind of &s;acrifice, and the good-humour of it with him&s;elf. It was better &s;aid by <HI>P. Syrus</HI> the actor, when he &s;aw one <HI>Mucius,</HI> a malevolent fellow, in a very melancholy mood&mdash;<HI>Either &s;ome ill fortune has befallen Mucius, or &s;ome good has happened to one of his acquaint|ance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="264">A man's fame &s;hall be recorded to po&s;terity by the trifling merit of a je&s;t, when the great things he has done would el&s;e have been buried in oblivion: Who would now have known that <HI>L. Mallius</HI> was once the be&s;t painter in Rome, if it was not for his repartee to <HI>Servilius Ge|minus?&mdash;You paint better than you model,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Geminus,</HI> pointing to <HI>Mallius</HI>'s children, who were crooked and ill-favoured.&mdash;<HI>Like enough,</HI> replied the arti&s;t; <HI>I paint in the daylight, but I model, as you call it, in the dark.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI> it is well known was a great joker, and &s;ome of his good &s;ayings have reached us; it does not appear as if his wit had been of the malicious &s;ort, and yet <HI>Pompey,</HI> who&s;e temper could not &s;tand a je&s;t, was &s;o galled by him, that he is reported to have &s;aid with great bit|terne&s;s&mdash;<HI>Oh! that Cicero would go over to my enemies, for then he would be afraid of me.</HI>&mdash;If <HI>Cicero</HI> forgave this &s;arca&s;m, I &s;hould call him not only a better-tempered, but a braver man than <HI>Pompey.</HI></P>

When <HI>Pacuvius Taurus</HI> greedily &s;olicited a large&s;s from the emperor, and to urge him to the greater liberality added, that all the world would have it, that he had made him a very bountiful donation&mdash;<HI>But you know better,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Augu&s;tus, than to believe the world</HI>&mdash;and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ycophant without his errand. I &s;hall mention one more ca&s;e, where, by a very courtly eva&s;ion, he parried the &s;olici|tation of his captain of the guard, who had been ca&s;hiered, and was petitioning the em|peror to allow him his pay; telling him that he did not a&s;k that indulgence for the &s;ake of the money which might accrue to him, but that he might have it to &s;ay he had re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, and not been ca&s;hiered&mdash;<HI>If that be all your rea&s;on,</HI> &s;ays the emperor, <HI>tell</HI>

<P><HI>Vatinius,</HI> who was noted to a proverb as a common &s;landerer, and particularly obnoxious for his &s;currility again&s;t <HI>Cicero,</HI> was pelted by the populace in the amphitheatre, whil&s;t he was giving them the Gladiators: He complained to the Aediles of the in&s;ult, and got an edict for|bidding the people to ca&s;t any thing into the area but apples. An arch fellow brought a fu|rious large fir-apple to the famous lawyer <HI>Ca&s;|cellius,</HI> and demanded his opinion upon the edict.&mdash;<HI>I am of opinion,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Ca&s;cellius, that your fir-apple is literally and legally an apple, with this provi&s;o however, that you intend to throw it at Vatinius's head.</HI></P>
<P>As there is &s;ome danger in making too free with <HI>old jokes,</HI> I &s;hall hold my hand for the pre&s;ent; but if the&s;e &s;hould &s;ucceed in being acceptable to my readers, I &s;hall not be afraid of meeting <HI>Mr. Jo&s;eph Miller</HI> and his modern wittici&s;ms with my antients. In that ca&s;e I &s;hall not de&s;pair of being able to lay before the public a veritable Roman new&s;paper, com|pounded of events in the days of Julius Cae&s;ar: By what happy chance I traced this valuable relick, and with what pains I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my&s;elf of it, may be matter of future explanation:
<PB N="256" REF="267">
I have the &s;atisfaction however to premi&s;e to the reader, that it is written with great freedom, and as well &s;prinkled with private anecdotes as any of the pre&s;ent day, who&s;e agreeable fa|miliarity is &s;o charming to every body but the parties concerned: It has al&s;o a good da&s;h of the dramatic; and as &s;ome fa&s;tidious people have been inclined to treat our intelligencers and reviewers with a degree of neglect bor|dering upon contempt, I &s;hall have plea&s;ure in &s;hewing that they have cla&s;&s;ical authority for all their quirks and conceits, and that they are all written in the true quaint &s;pirit of cri|tici&s;m: It is to be lamented that the Roman theatre furni&s;hes no ladies to match the he|roines of our &s;tage; but I can produce &s;ome encomiums upon <HI>Laberius, Ro&s;cius</HI> and the famous <HI>Publius Syrus,</HI> which would not be unapplicable to &s;ome of our pre&s;ent capital actors: I am &s;orry to be obliged to confe&s;s, that they were not in the habit of &s;peaking epilogues in tho&s;e days; but I have a &s;ub&s;ti|tute in a prologue written and &s;poken by <HI>Decimus Laberius,</HI> which I am tempted to throw out as a lure to my new&s;paper; but I mu&s;t fir&s;t explain upon what occa&s;ion it was com|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>This <HI>Laberius</HI> was a Roman knight of good

family, and a man withal of high &s;pirit and pre|ten&s;ions, but unfortunately he had a talent for the drama: He read his own plays better than any man then living could act them, for neither <HI>Garrick</HI> nor <HI>Hender&s;on</HI> were yet born. <HI>P. Clodius,</HI> the fine gentleman and rake of the age, had the indecorum to pre&s;s <HI>Laberius</HI> to come forward on the public &s;tage, and take the principal character in one of his own plays: <HI>Laberius</HI> was indig|nant, and <HI>Clodius</HI> proceeded to menaces:&mdash;<HI>Do your wor&s;t,</HI> &s;ays the Roman knight, <HI>you can but &s;end me to Dyracchium and back again</HI>&mdash;proudly intimating that he would &s;uffer the like bani&s;h|ment with <HI>Cicero</HI> rather than con&s;ent to his de|mand; for acting was not then the amu&s;ement of people of fa&s;hion, and private theatres were not thought of. <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> was no le&s;s captivated with <HI>Laberius</HI>'s talents than <HI>Clodius</HI> had been, and being a man not apt to be di&s;couraged by common difficulties, took up the &s;ame &s;olicita|tion, and a&s;&s;ailed our Roman knight, who was now &s;ixty years of age, and felt his powers in their decline: Con&s;cious of this decline no le&s;s than of his own dignity, he re&s;i&s;ted the degrading reque&s;t; he interceded, he implored of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> to excu&s;e him: It was to no purpo&s;e, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> had made it his point, and his point he would carry: The word of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was law, and <HI>Laberius,</HI>

<HEAD>N^o LXXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>DR. Samuel John&s;on, in his life of Rowe, pronounces of <HI>The Fair Penitent, that it is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing tragedies on the &s;tage, where it &s;till keeps its turns of appearing, and pro|bably will long keep them, for that there is &s;carcely any work of any poet at once &s;o intere&s;ting by the fable, and &s;o delightful by the language. The &s;tory,</HI> he ob&s;erves, <HI>is dome&s;tic, and therefore ea&s;ily received by the imagination, and a&s;&s;imilated to common life; the diction is exqui&s;itely harmonious, and &s;oft or &s;prightly as occa&s;ion requires.</HI> Few people, I be|lieve, will think this character of <HI>The Fair Peni|tent</HI> too lavi&s;h on the &s;core of commendation; the high degree of public favour in which this tragedy has long &s;tood, has ever attracted the be&s;t audiences to it, and engaged the talents of the be&s;t performers in its di&s;play. As there is no drama more frequently exhibited, or more gene|rally read, I propo&s;e to give it a fair and impar|tial examination, jointly with the more unknown and le&s;s popular tragedy from which it is derived.</P>
<P><HI>The Fair Penitent</HI> is in fable and character &s;o clo&s;ely copied from <HI>The Fatal Dowry,</HI> that it is impo&s;&s;ible not to take that tragedy along with it; and it is matter of &s;ome &s;urprize to me that Rowe
<PB N="264" REF="275">
&s;hould have made no acknowledgment of his imitation either in his dedication or prologue, or any where el&s;e that I am appri&s;ed of.</P>
<P>This tragedy of <HI>The Fatal Dowry</HI> was the joint production of Ma&s;&s;inger and Nathaniel Field; it takes a wider compa&s;s of fable than <HI>The Fair Penitent,</HI> by which means it pre&s;ents a very af|fecting &s;cene at the opening, which di&s;covers young Charalois attended by his friend Romont, waiting with a petition in his hand to be pre|&s;ented to the judges, when they &s;hall meet, pray|ing the relea&s;e of his dead father's body, which had been &s;eized by his creditors, and detained in their hands for debts he had incurred in the pub|lic &s;ervice, as Field Mar&s;hal of the armies of Burgundy. Ma&s;&s;inger, to who&s;e &s;hare this part of the tragedy devolved, has managed this pa|thetic introduction with con&s;ummate &s;kill and great expre&s;&s;ion of nature; a noble youth in the la&s;t &s;tate of worldly di&s;tre&s;s, reduced to the hu|miliating yet pious office of &s;oliciting an unfeel|ing and unfriendly judge to allow him to pay the &s;olemn rites of burial to the remains of an illu&s;|trious father, who had fought his country's bat|tles with glory, and had &s;acrificed life and fortune in defence of an ingrateful &s;tate, impre&s;&s;es the &s;pectators mind with pity and re&s;pect, which are felt through every pa&s;&s;age of the play: One thing
<PB N="265" REF="276">
in particular &s;trikes me at the opening of the &s;cene, which is the long &s;ilence that the poet has artfully impo&s;ed upon his principal character (Charalois) who &s;tands in mute &s;orrow with his petition in his hand, whil&s;t his friend Romont, and his advocate Charmi, urge him to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to the judges and &s;olicit them in per&s;on: The judges now make their entrance, they &s;top upon the &s;tage; they offer him the faire&s;t oppor|tunity for tendering his petition and &s;oliciting his &s;uit: Charalois remains fixed and &s;peechle&s;s; Romont, who is all eagerne&s;s in his cau&s;e, pre&s;&s;es him again and again&mdash;<Q><SP>

What could Chara|lois have uttered to give him that intere&s;t in the hearts of his &s;pectators, which their own conclu|&s;ions during his affecting &s;ilence have already im|pre&s;&s;ed?

<PB N="267" REF="278">
This is Hamlet him&s;elf, his <HI>inky cloak,</HI> and <HI>cu&s;tom|ary &s;uits of &s;olemn black.</HI> The character of Charalois is thus fixed before he &s;peaks; the poet's art has given the prejudice that is to bear him in our affections through all the &s;ucceeding events of the fable; and a &s;triking contra&s;t is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed between the undi&s;cerning fiery zeal of Romont, and Charalois' fine &s;en&s;ibility and high|born dignity of &s;oul.</P>
<P>A more methodical and regular dramati&s;t would have &s;topped here, &s;atisfied that the impre&s;|&s;ion already made was fully &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es of his plot; but Ma&s;&s;inger, according to the bu&s;y &s;pirit of the &s;tage for which he wrote, is not alarmed by a throng of incidents, and pro|ceeds to open the court and di&s;cu&s;s the pleadings on the &s;tage: The advocate Charmi in a &s;et ha|rangue moves the judges for di&s;pen&s;ing with the rigour of the law in favour of creditors, and for re&s;cuing the Mar&s;hal's corp&s;e out of their clutches; he is brow-beaten and &s;ilenced by the pre&s;iding judge old Novall: The plea is then taken up by the impetuous Romont, and urged with &s;o much per&s;onal in&s;olence, that he is arre&s;ted on the &s;pot, put in charge of the officers of the court, and taken to pri&s;on. This is a very &s;triking mode of introducing the &s;et oration of Charalois; a &s;on re|counting the military atchievments of a newly

decea&s;ed father, and imploring mercy from his creditors and the law towards his unburied re|mains, now claims the attention of the court, who had been hitherto unmoved by the feeble formality of a hired pleader, and the turbulent pa&s;&s;ion of an enraged &s;oldier. Charalois' argument takes a mid|dle cour&s;e between both; the pious feelings of a &s;on, tempered by the mode&s;t manners of a gentle|man: The creditors however are implacable, the judge is ho&s;tile, and the law mu&s;t take its cour&s;e.</P>

<P>There was yet another incident, which the poet's pa&s;&s;ion for bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;pectacle induced him to avail him&s;elf of, viz. the funeral of the Mar&s;hal; this he di&s;plays on the &s;tage, with a train of captains and &s;oldiers following the body of their general: Charalois and Romont, under cu&s;tody of their jailors, appear as chief mourners, and a party of creditors are concerned in the groupe.</P>
<P>After this &s;olemnity is di&s;patched, the poet pro|ceeds to develop the amiable genero&s;ity of old Rochfort, who being touched with the gallant &s;pirit of Romont, and &s;till more penetrated with the filial piety of young Charalois, delivers them both from impri&s;onment and di&s;tre&s;s, by di&s;charg|ing the debts of the Mar&s;hal and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the creditors: This al&s;o pa&s;&s;es before the eyes of the &s;pectators. Before Charalois has given full ex|pre&s;&s;ion to his gratitude for this extraordinary be|nefaction, Rochfort follows it with a further act of bounty, which he introduces in the &s;tile of a reque&s;t&mdash;<Q><PB N="270" REF="281">
<SP>
<L>Call in my daughter&mdash;Still I have a &s;uit to you,</L>
<L>Would you requite me&mdash;</L>
<L>This is my only child.</L>
</SP></Q>
Beaumelle, Rochfort's daughter, is pre&s;ented to Charalois; the &s;cene is hurried on with a pre|cipitation almo&s;t without example: Charalois a&s;ks the lady,
<Q><SP>
<L>Fair Beaumelle, can you love me?</L>

<L>You need not que&s;tion me if I can you:</L>
<L>You are the faire&s;t virgin in Dijon,</L>
<L>And Rochfort is your father.</L>
</SP></Q>
The match is agreed upon as &s;oon as propo&s;ed, and Rochfort ha&s;tens away to prepare the cele|bration.</P>
<P>In this clu&s;ter of incidents I mu&s;t not fail to remark, that the poet introduces young Novall upon the &s;cene, in the very moment when the &s;hort dialogue above quoted was pa&s;&s;ing: This Novall had before been exhibited as a &s;uitor to Beaumelle, and his vain frivolous character had been di&s;played in a very ridiculous and contempt|ible light; he is now again introduced to be a witne&s;s of his own di&s;appointment, and his only ob&s;ervation upon it is&mdash;<HI>What's this change?</HI>&mdash;Upon the exit of the father however he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the lady, and her reply gives the alarm|ing
<PB N="271" REF="282">
hint, that makes di&s;covery of the fatal turn which the plot is now about to take; for when Novall turning a&s;ide to Beaumelle, by one word&mdash;<HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s!</HI>&mdash;conveys the reproach of incon&s;tan|cy, &s;he replies,
<Q><SP>
<L>Oh, Servant! Virtue &s;trengthen me!</L>
<L>Thy pre&s;ence blows round my affection's vane:</L>
<L>You will undo me if you &s;peak again.</L>
<STAGE>(Exit.)</STAGE>
</SP></Q>
Young Novall is left on the &s;cene with certain followers and dependants, which hang upon his fortune, one of which (Pontalier by name) a man under deep obligations to him, yet of an ho|ne&s;t nature, advi&s;es him to an honourable renun|ciation of all further hopes or attempts to avail him&s;elf of the affections of Beaumelle&mdash;<Q><SP>
<L>Tho' you have &s;av'd my life,</L>
<L>Re&s;cu'd me often from my wants, I mu&s;t not</L>
<L>Wink at your follies, that will ruin you.</L>
<L>You know my blunt way, and my love to truth:</L>
<L>For&s;ake the pur&s;uit of this lady's honour,</L>
<L>Now you do &s;ee her made another man's.</L>
</SP></Q>
This honourable advice is rejected with con|tempt: Novall, in who&s;e mean bo&s;om there does not &s;eem a trace of virtue, avows a determined per&s;everance; and the poet having in this ha&s;ty manner compleated the&s;e inau&s;picious nuptials, clo&s;es the &s;econd act of his tragedy.</P>

<HEAD>N^o LXXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now expended two entire acts of <HI>The Fatal Dowry</HI> in advancing to that period in the fable, at which the tragedy of <HI>The Fair Penitent</HI> opens. If the author of this tra|gedy thought it nece&s;&s;ary to contract Ma&s;&s;inger's plot, and found one upon it of a more regular con&s;truction, I know not how he could do this any otherwi&s;e than by taking up the &s;tory at the point where we have now left it, and throwing the antecedent matter into narration; and though the&s;e two prefatory acts are full of very affecting incidents, yet the pathos, which properly apper|tains to the plot and conduces to the cata&s;trophe of the tragedy, does not in &s;trictne&s;s take place before the event of the marriage. No critic will &s;ay that the pleadings before the judges, the in|terference of the creditors, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Cha|ralois, or the funeral of the Mar&s;hal, are nece&s;&s;ary parts of the drama; at the &s;ame time no reader will deny (and neither could Rowe him&s;elf overlook) the effect of the&s;e incidents: He could not fail to fore&s;ee that he was to &s;acrifice very much of the intere&s;t of his fable, when he was to throw that upon narration, which his original had given in &s;pectacle; and the lo&s;s was more enhanced by
<PB N="273" REF="284">
falling upon the hero of the drama; for who that compares Charalois, at the end of the &s;econd act of Ma&s;&s;inger, with Rowe's Altamont at the opening &s;cene of <HI>The Fair Penitent,</HI> can doubt which character has mo&s;t intere&s;t with the &s;pec|tators? We have &s;een the former in all the mo&s;t amiable offices which filial piety could perform; enduring in&s;ults from his inveterate oppre&s;&s;ors, and voluntarily &s;urrendering him&s;elf to a pri&s;on to ran&s;om the dead body of his father from un|relenting creditors. Altamont pre&s;ents him&s;elf before us in his wedding &s;uit, in the &s;plendour of fortune and at the &s;ummit of happine&s;s; he greets us with a bur&s;t of exultation&mdash;<Q><SP>
<L>Let this au&s;picious day be ever &s;acred,</L>
<L>No mourning, no misfortunes happen on it;</L>
<L>Let it be mark'd for triumphs and rejoicings!</L>
<L>Let happy lovers ever make it holy,</L>
<L>Choo&s;e it to ble&s;s their hopes and crown their wi&s;hes;</L>
<L>This happy day, that gives me my Cali&s;ta!</L>
</SP></Q>
The re&s;t of the &s;cene is employed by him and Horatio alternately in recounting the benefits conferred upon them by the generous Sciolto; and the very &s;ame incident of the &s;eizure of his father's corp&s;e by the creditors, and his redemp|tion of it, is recited by Horatio&mdash;<Q><PB N="274" REF="285">
<SP>
<L>When his hard creditors,</L>
<L>Urg'd and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Lothario's father,</L>
<L>(Foe to thy hou&s;e and rival of their greatne&s;s)</L>
<L>By &s;entence of the cruel law forbade</L>
<L>His venerable corp&s;e to re&s;t in earth,</L>
<L>Thou gav'&s;t thy&s;elf a ran&s;om for his bones;</L>
<L>With piety uncommon did&s;t give up</L>
<L>Thy hopeful youth to &s;laves, who ne'er knew mercy.</L>
</SP></Q>
It is not however within the reach of this, or any other de&s;cription, to place Altamont in that inte|re&s;ting and amiable light, as circum&s;tances have already placed Charalois; the happy and exulting bridegroom may be an object of our congratula|tion, but the virtuous and &s;uffering Charalois engages our pity, love and admiration. If Rowe would have his audience credit Altamont for that filial piety, which marks the character he copied from, it was a &s;mall over&s;ight to put the following expre&s;&s;ion into his mouth&mdash;<Q><SP>
<L>Oh, great Sciolto! Oh, my more than father!</L>
</SP></Q>
A clo&s;er attention to character would have re|minded him that it was po&s;&s;ible for Altamont to expre&s;s his gratitude to Sciolto without &s;etting him above a father, to who&s;e memory he had paid &s;uch devotion.</P>
<P>From this contraction of his plot, by the de|falcation of &s;o many pathetic incidents, it became

impo&s;&s;ible for the author of the Fair Penitent to make his Altamont the hero of his tragedy, and the leading part is taken from him by Horatio, and even by Lothario, throughout the drama. There are &s;everal other rea&s;ons, which concur to &s;ink Altamont upon the compari&s;on with Charalois, the chief of which ari&s;es from the captivating colours in which Rowe has painted his libertine: On the contrary, Ma&s;&s;inger gives a contemptible picture of his young Novall; he makes him not only vicious, but ridiculous; in foppery and impertinence he is the counterpart of Shake&s;pear's O&s;rick; vain-glorious, pur&s;e|proud, and overbearing among&s;t his dependants; a &s;piritle&s;s poltroon in his interview with Ro|mont. <HI>Lothario</HI> (as John&s;on ob&s;erves) <HI>with gaiety which cannot be hated, and bravery which cannot be de&s;pi&s;ed, retains too much of the &s;pectator's kindne&s;s.</HI> His high &s;pirit, brilliant qualities and fine per&s;on are &s;o de&s;cribed, as to put us in dan|ger of fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ions in his favour, and to &s;et the pa&s;&s;ions in oppo&s;ition to the moral of the piece: I &s;u&s;pect that the gallantry of Lothario makes more advocates for Cali&s;ta than &s;he ought to have. There is another con&s;ideration, which operates again&s;t Altamont, and it is an indelicacy in his character, which the poet &s;hould have pro|vided again&s;t: He marries Cali&s;ta with the full

<L>Oh! could I hope there was one thought of Altamont,</L>

<L>With all the tendere&s;t eloquence of love</L>
<L>I beg'd to be a &s;harer in her grief:</L>
<L>But &s;he, with looks aver&s;e and eyes that froze me,</L>
<L>Sadly replied, her &s;orrows were her own,</L>
<L>Nor in a father's power to di&s;po&s;e of.</L>
</SP></Q>
I am aware that Sciolto attempts to parry the&s;e facts by an interpretation too gro&s;s and unbe|coming for a father's character, and only fit for the lips of a Lothario; but yet it is not in nature to &s;uppo&s;e that Altamont could mi&s;take &s;uch &s;ymptoms, and it fixes a meanne&s;s upon him, which prevails again&s;t his character throughout the play. Nothing of this &s;ort could be di&s;co|vered by Ma&s;&s;inger's bridegroom, for the cere|mony was agreed upon and performed at the very fir&s;t interview of the parties; Beaumelle gave a full and unre&s;erved a&s;&s;ent, and though her character &s;uffers on the &s;core of hypocri&s;y on that account, yet Charalois is &s;aved by it: Le&s;s
<PB N="277" REF="288">
hypocri&s;y appears in Cali&s;ta, but hers is the deeper guilt, becau&s;e &s;he was already di&s;honoured by Lothario, and Beaumelle's coquetry with No|vall had not yet reached the length of criminality. Add to this, that Altamont appears in the con|temptible light of a &s;uitor, whom Cali&s;ta had apprized of her aver&s;ion, and to whom &s;he had done a deliberate act of di&s;honour, though his per&s;on and character mu&s;t have been long known to her. The ca&s;e is far otherwi&s;e between Cha|ralois and Beaumelle, who never met before, and every care is taken by the poet to &s;ave his hero from &s;uch a deliberate injury, as might convey contempt; with this view the marriage is precipitated; nothing is allowed to pa&s;s, that might open the character of Charalois to Beau|melle: She is hurried into an a&s;&s;ignation with Novall immediately upon her marriage; every artifice of &s;eduction is employed by her confi|dante Bellaperte, and Aymer the para&s;ite of No|vall, to make this meeting criminal; &s;he falls the victim of pa&s;&s;ion, and when detection brings her to a &s;en&s;e of her guilt, &s;he makes this penitent and pathetic appeal to Charalois&mdash;<Q><SP>

Compare this with the conduct of Cali&s;ta, and then decide which frail fair-one has the better title to the appellation of a <HI>Penitent,</HI> and which drama conveys the better moral by its cata|&s;trophe.</P>
<P>There is indeed a gro&s;&s;ne&s;s in the older poet, which his more modern imitator has refined; but he has only &s;weetened the poi&s;on, not re|moved its venom; nay, by how much more pa|latable he has made it, &s;o much more pernici|ous it is become in his tempting &s;parkling cup, than in the coar&s;e deterring do&s;e of Ma&s;&s;inger.</P>
<P>Rowe has no doubt greatly out&s;tepped his original in the &s;triking character of Lothario,
<PB N="279" REF="290">
who leaves Novall as far behind him as Chara|lois does Altamont: It is admitted then that Cali&s;ta has as good a plea as any wanton could wi&s;h to urge for her criminality with Lothario, and the poet has not &s;pared the ear of mode&s;ty in his exaggerated de&s;cription of the guilty &s;cene; every luxurious image, that his inflamed ima|gination could crowd into the glowing rhap&s;ody, is there to be found, and the whole is recited in numbers &s;o flowing and harmonious, that they not only arre&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions but the memory al&s;o, and perhaps have been, and &s;till can be, as gene|rally repeated as any pa&s;&s;age in Engli&s;h poetry. Ma&s;&s;inger with le&s;s elegance, but not with le&s;s regard to decency, &s;uffers the guilty act to pa&s;s within the cour&s;e of his drama; the greater re|finement of manners in Rowe's day did not allow of this, and he anticipated the incident; but when he revived the recollection of it by &s;uch a &s;tudied de&s;cription, he plainly &s;hewed that it was not from moral principle that he omitted it; and if he has pre&s;ented his heroine to the &s;pectators with more immediate delicacy during the com|pa&s;s of the play, he has at the &s;ame time given her greater depravity of mind; her manners may be more refined, but her principle is fouler than Beaumelle's. Cali&s;ta, who yielded to the gallant gay Lothario, <HI>hot with the Tu&s;can grape,</HI> might

The letter of Cali&s;ta (which brings about the di&s;covery by the poor expedient of Lothario's dropping it and Horatio's finding it) has not even the merit of being characteri&s;tically wicked, and is both in its matter and mode below trage|dy. It is <HI>Lothario's cruelty has determined her to yield a perfect obedience to her father, and give her hand to Altamont, in &s;pite of her weakne&s;s for the fal&s;e Lothario.</HI>&mdash;If the lady had given her <HI>perfect obedience</HI> its true denomination, &s;he had called it a mo&s;t di&s;honourable compliance; and if we may take Lothario's word (who &s;eems full correct enough in de&s;cribing facts and particulars) &s;he had not much cau&s;e to complain of his being fal&s;e; for he tells Ro&s;&s;ano&mdash;<Q><PB N="281" REF="292">

It appears by this that Lothario had not been <HI>fal&s;e</HI> to her in the article of marriage, though he might have been <HI>cruel</HI> to her on the &s;core of pa&s;&s;ion, which indeed is confe&s;t on his part with as much <HI>cold indifference,</HI> as the mo&s;t barefaced avowal could expre&s;s.&mdash;But to return to the letter: She proceeds to tell him&mdash;<HI>that &s;he could almo&s;t wi&s;h &s;he had that heart, and that honour to be&s;tow with it, which he has robbed her of</HI>&mdash;But le&s;t this half wi&s;h &s;hould &s;tartle him, &s;he adds&mdash;<HI>But oh!

<P>THOUGH the part which Horatio takes in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the drama is exactly that which falls to the &s;hare of Romont in the Fatal Dowry, yet their characters are of a very different ca&s;t; for as Rowe had be&s;towed the fire and impetuo&s;ity of Romont upon his Lo|thario, it was a very judicious oppo&s;ition to contra&s;t it with the cool deliberate courage of the &s;ententious Horatio, the friend and bro|ther-in-law of Altamont.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="294">When Horatio has read Cali&s;ta's letter, which Lothario had dropped (an accident which more frequently happens to gentlemen in comedies than in tragedies) he falls into a very long me|ditation, and clo&s;es it with putting this que&s;tion to him&s;elf:

At this moment he is interrupted in his re|flections by the pre&s;ence of Lavinia, who&s;e tender &s;olicitude fills up the remaining part of the dialogue, and concludes the act without any deci&s;ive re&s;olution on the part of Horatio; an incident well contrived, and introduced with much dramatic &s;kill and effect: Though pre&s;&s;ed by his wife to di&s;clo&s;e the cau&s;e of his unea&s;i|ne&s;s, he does not impart to her the fatal di&s;|covery he has made; this al&s;o is well in cha|racter.

This &s;oliloquy is &s;ucceeded by the much-admired and &s;triking &s;cene between him and Lothario; rigid critici&s;m might wi&s;h to abridge &s;ome of the &s;ententious declamatory &s;peeches of Horatio, and &s;horten the dialogue to quicken the effect; but the moral &s;entiment and har|monious ver&s;ification are much too charming to be treated as intruders, and the author has al&s;o &s;truck upon a natural expedient for pro|longing the dialogue, without any violence to probability, by the interpo&s;ition of Ro&s;&s;ano, who acts as a mediator between the ho&s;tile parties. This interpo&s;ition is further nece&s;&s;ary to pre|vent a deci&s;ive rencounter, for which the fable is not ripe; neither would it be proper for Ho|ratio to anticipate that revenge, which is re|&s;erved for Altamont: The altercation therefore clo&s;es with a challenge from Lothario&mdash;<Q><SP>

Whether this be a mea&s;ure altogether in cha|racter with a man of Horatio's good &s;en&s;e and di&s;cretion, I mu&s;t own is matter of doubt with me. I think he appears fully &s;atisfied of her actual criminality; and in that ca&s;e it would be more natural for him to lay his mea&s;ures for intercepting Lothario, and preventing the a&s;&s;ig|nation, than to try his rhetoric in the pre&s;ent

cri&s;is upon the agitated mind of Cali&s;ta. As it has ju&s;tly occurred to him, that he has been over-reached by Lothario in the po&s;tponement of the duel, the mea&s;ure I &s;ugge&s;t would natu|rally tend to ha&s;ten that rencounter. Now, though the bu&s;ine&s;s of the drama may require an explanation between Horatio and Cali&s;ta, whereupon to ground an occa&s;ion for his in|tere&s;ting quarrel with Altamont, yet I do not &s;ee any nece&s;&s;ity to make that a premeditated explanation, nor to &s;acrifice character by a mea|&s;ure that is incon&s;i&s;tent with the better judg|ment of Horatio. The poet, however, has decreed it otherwi&s;e, and a deliberate interview with Cali&s;ta and Horatio accordingly takes place.

Charalois is a cha|racter at lea&s;t as high and irritable as Altamont, and Romont is out of all compari&s;on more rough and plain-&s;poken than Horatio: Chara|lois might be deceived into an opinion of Beaumelle's affection for him, Altamont could not deceive him&s;elf into &s;uch a notion, and the lady had te&s;tified her di&s;like of him in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, accompanied with &s;ymptoms which he him&s;elf had de&s;cribed as indicating &s;ome rooted and concealed affliction: Could any &s;olution be more natural than what Ho|ratio gives? Novall was a rival &s;o contemptible, that Charalois could not, with any degree of probability, con&s;ider him as an object of his jealou&s;y; it would have been a degradation of his character, had he yielded to &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion: Lothario, on the contrary, was of all men living the mo&s;t to be apprehended by a hu&s;band, let his confidence or vanity be ever &s;o great. Rowe, in his attempt to <HI>&s;urprize,</HI> has &s;acrificed

nature and the truth of character for &s;tage-effect; Ma&s;&s;inger, by pre&s;erving both nature and character, has conducted his friends through an angry altercation with infinitely more &s;pirit, more pathos and more dramatic effect, and yet di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with the following animated and affecting &s;peech from Charalois to his friend:
<Q><SP>
<L>Thou'rt not my friend;</L>
<L>Or being &s;o, thou'rt mad. I mu&s;t not buy</L>
<L>Thy friend&s;hip at this rate. Had I ju&s;t cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Thou know'&s;t I dur&s;t pur&s;ue &s;uch injury</L>
<L>Thro' fire, air, water, earth, nay, were they all</L>
<L>Shuffled again to chaos; but there's none.</L>
<L>Thy &s;kill, Romont, con&s;i&s;ts in camps, not courts.</L>
<L>Farewel, uncivil man! let's meet no more:</L>
<L>Here our long web of friend&s;hip I untwi&s;t.</L>
<L>Shall I go whine, walk pale, and lock my wife</L>
<L>For nothing from her birth's free liberty,</L>
<L>That open'd mine to me? Yes; if I do,</L>
<L>The name of cuckold then dog me with &s;corn:</L>
<L>I am a Frenchman, no Italian born.</L>
<STAGE>(Exit.)</STAGE>
</SP></Q>
It is plain that Altamont at lea&s;t was an ex|ception to this remark upon <HI>Italian</HI> hu&s;bands, I &s;hall pur&s;ue this compari&s;on no further, nor offer any other remark upon the incident of the blow given by Altamont, except with regard to Horatio's conduct upon receiving it; he draws his &s;word, and immediately &s;u&s;pends re&s;entment upon the following motive:
<Q><PB N="293" REF="304">
<SP>
<L>Yet hold! By Heav'n, his father's in his face!</L>
<L>Spite of my wrongs, my heart runs o'er with tender|ne&s;s,</L>
<L>And I could rather die my&s;elf than hurt him.</L>
</SP></Q>
We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it was the martial attitude that Altamont had put him&s;elf into, which brought the re&s;emblance of his father &s;o &s;trongly to the ob&s;ervation of Horatio, otherwi&s;e it was a very unnatural moment to recollect it in, when he had ju&s;t received the deepe&s;t in&s;ult one man can give to another: It is however worth a remark, that this father of Altamont &s;hould act on both &s;ides, and yet mi&s;carry in his me|diation; for it is but a few pa&s;&s;ages before that Altamont &s;ays to Horatio,
<Q><SP>
<L>Thou wert my father's friend; he lov'd thee well;</L>
<L>A venerable mark of him</L>
<L>Hangs round thee, and protects thee from my ven|geance.</L>
<L>I cannot, dare not lift my &s;word again&s;t thee.</L>
</SP></Q>
What this <HI>mark</HI> was is left to conjecture; but it is plain it was as &s;ea&s;onable for Horatio's re&s;cue at this moment, as it was for Altamont a few moments after, who had certainly over|looked it when he &s;truck the very friend again&s;t whom he could not, dared not <HI>lift his &s;word.</HI></P>
<P>When Lavinia's entrance has parted Alta|mont

<L>He, who was all to me, child, brother, friend,</L>
<L>With barbarous bloody malice &s;ought my life.</L>
</SP></Q>
The&s;e are very extraordinary terms for a man like Horatio to u&s;e, and &s;eem to convey a charge very unfit for him to make, and of a very differ|ent nature from the ha&s;ty in&s;ult he had received; in fact it appears as if the blow had totally re|ver&s;ed his character, for the re&s;olution he takes in con&s;equence of this per&s;onal affront is ju&s;t &s;uch an one as would be only taken by the man who dared not to re&s;ent it&mdash;<Q><SP>

<L>To &s;ome more hone&s;t di&s;tant clime we'll go:</L>
<L>Nor will I be beholden to my country</L>
<L>For aught but thee, the partner of my flight.</L>
</SP></Q>
That Horatio's heroi&s;m did not con&s;i&s;t in the ready forgivene&s;s of injuries is evident from the ob&s;tinate &s;ullenne&s;s with which he rejects the penitent apologies of Altamont in the further progre&s;s of the play; I am at a lo&s;s therefore to know what colour the poet meant to give his character by di&s;po&s;ing him to quit his country with this in&s;ult unatoned for, and the additional
<PB N="295" REF="306">
&s;tigma upon him of running away from his ap|pointment with Lothario for the next morning <HI>among&s;t the rocks.</HI> Had he meant to bring him off upon the repugnance he felt of re&s;enting any injury again&s;t the &s;on of a father, who&s;e image was &s;o vi&s;ible <HI>in his face,</HI> that his <HI>heart ran o'er with fondne&s;s in &s;pite of his wrongs, and he could rather die than hurt him</HI>; &s;urely that image would have interceded no le&s;s powerfully for him, when, penetrated with remor&s;e, he intercedes for pity and forgivene&s;s, and even faints at his feet with agony at his unrelenting coduracy: It would be unfair to &s;uppo&s;e he was more like his father when he had dealt him an in&s;ulting blow, than when he was atoning for an injury by the mo&s;t ample &s;atisfaction and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This is the light in which the conduct of Horatio &s;trikes me; if I am wrong, I owe an atonement to the manes of an elegant poet, which, upon conviction of my error, I will &s;tudy to pay in the fulle&s;t manner I am able.</P>
<P>It now remains only to &s;ay a few words upon the cata&s;trophe, in which the author varies from his original, by making Cali&s;ta de&s;troy her&s;elf with a dagger, put into her hand for that pur|po&s;e by her father: If I am to moralize upon this proceeding of Sciolto, I know full well the incident cannot bear up again&s;t it; a Roman
<PB N="296" REF="307">
father would &s;tand the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion better than a Chri&s;tian one; and I al&s;o know that the mo&s;t natural expedient is unluckily a mo&s;t undramatic one; yet the poet did not totally overlook it, for he makes Sciolto's fir&s;t thought turn upon a convent, if I rightly under&s;tand the following pa&s;&s;age&mdash;<Q><SP>
<L>Hence from my &s;ight! thy father cannot bear thee:</L>
<L>Fly with thy infamy to &s;ome dark cell,</L>
<L>Where, on the confines of eternal night,</L>
<L>Mourning, misfortunes, cares and angui&s;h dwell;</L>

</SP></Q>
Whil&s;t I am tran&s;cribing the&s;e lines a doubt &s;trikes me that I have mi&s;interpreted them, and yet Cali&s;ta's an&s;wer &s;eems to point to the mean|ing I had &s;ugge&s;ted; perhaps however they are mere ravings in fine numbers without any deter|minate idea: Whatever they may be, it is clear they do not go to the length of death: He tells Altamont, as &s;oon as &s;he is departed&mdash;<Q><SP>
<L>I wo' not kill her;</L>

He &s;eems in this moment to have formed the re&s;olution, which he afterwards puts into execu|tion; he prompts her to &s;elf-murder, and arms her for the act: This may &s;ave the &s;pectators a &s;ight too &s;hocking to behold, but does it convey le&s;s horror to the heart, than if he had put her to death with his own hand? A father killing his child for incontinence with the man whom he had not permitted to marry her, when he &s;olicit|ed his con&s;ent, is an act too mon&s;trous to reflect upon: Is that father le&s;s a mon&s;ter, who, deli|berately and after full reflection, puts a dagger into her hand and bids her commit &s;elf-murder?

I need not point out the contra&s;t between this and the quotations from Cali&s;ta.

<P>I Believe there are few people, who have not at &s;ome time or other felt a propen&s;ity to humour them&s;elves in that kind of melancholy, which ari&s;es in the mind upon revi&s;iting the &s;cene of former happine&s;s, and contemplating the change that time has wrought in its appearance by the mournful compari&s;on of pre&s;ent with pa&s;t impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In this train of thought I was the other day car|ried almo&s;t imperceptibly to the country &s;eat of a decea&s;ed friend, who&s;e lo&s;s I mu&s;t ever lament. I had not been there &s;ince his death, and there was a drearine&s;s in the &s;cene as I approached, that might have almo&s;t tempted me to believe even
<PB N="303" REF="314">
things inanimate partook of my &s;en&s;ations. The traces of my friend, who&s;e &s;olicitude for order and &s;eemline&s;s reached to every thing about him, were no longer to be &s;een: The cottages and little gardens of his poor neighbours, which u&s;ed to be &s;o trim and neat, whil&s;t his eye was over them, &s;eemed to be falling into neglect; the lawn before his hou&s;e was now become a &s;oli|tude; no labourers at their work; no dome&s;tics at their &s;ports and exerci&s;es: I looked around for my old acquaintance, that u&s;ed to be grazing up and down upon their pen&s;ions of pa&s;turage; they had probably been food for hounds long ago; Nature had lo&s;t her &s;mile of ho&s;pitality and benevolence; methought I never &s;aw any thing more di&s;con&s;olate.</P>
<P>As I entered the hou&s;e, an aged woman, whom I had long remembered as one of the family, met me in the pa&s;&s;age, and, looking me in the face, cried out, <Q REND="inline">"Is it you, Sir?"</Q>&mdash;and bur&s;t into tears: She followed me into the common &s;itting-room, and as &s;he was opening the &s;hut|ters, ob&s;erved to me&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That it did not look as it u&s;ed to do, when my lord was living."</Q>
It was true; I had already made the remark in &s;ilence:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"How the face of a friend,"</Q> &s;aid I within my&s;elf,
<Q REND="inline">"enlivens all things about him! What hours of placid delight have I pa&s;&s;ed

within the&s;e walls! Have I ever heard a word here fall from his lips, that I have wi&s;hed him to recall? Has the reputation of the ab&s;ent ever bled by a &s;tab of his giving? Has the &s;en&s;ibility of any per&s;on pre&s;ent &s;uffered for an expre&s;&s;ion of his? Once, and only once, in this very &s;pot, I drew from him the circum|&s;tantial detail of an unfortunate period in his life: It was a recital &s;o manly and ingenuous, &s;o void of colouring, &s;o di&s;dainful of complaint and &s;o untainted by a&s;perity, that it carried conviction to my mind, and I can &s;carce con|ceive a degree of prejudice that could have held out again&s;t it; but I could perceive that the greate&s;t event in a man's hi&s;tory may turn by &s;prings &s;o &s;ubtle and concealed, that they can never be laid open for public exculpation, and that in the proce&s;s of all human trials there may be things too &s;mall for the fingers of the law to feel; motives, which produce the good or ill fortunes of men and govern their actions, but which cannot guide the judgments, or even come under the con|templation of tho&s;e who are appointed to de|cide upon them."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;oon quitted this apartment, and entered one which I contemplated with more &s;atisfaction, and even with a degree of veneration; for it was
<PB N="305" REF="316">
the chamber, in which I had &s;een my friend yield up the la&s;t breath of life. Few men had endured greater per&s;ecution in the world; none could leave it in greater peace and charity: If forgivene&s;s of injuries con&s;titutes a merit, our enemies &s;urely are tho&s;e to whom we are mo&s;t beholden. How awful is the la&s;t &s;cene of a man's life, who has filled a dubious and im|portant part on the &s;tage of the world!&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Of a truth,"</Q>
thought I,
<Q REND="inline">"thou art happily re|moved out of an unfriendly world; if thou had&s;t deceived my good opinion, it had been an injury to my nature: But though the living man can wear a ma&s;k and carry on deceit, the dying Chri&s;tian cannot counterfeit: Sudden death may &s;mite the hypocrite, the &s;en&s;uali&s;t, the impo&s;tor, and they may die in their &s;hame; but &s;low and gradual di&s;&s;olution, a lingering death of agony and decay, will &s;trip the human heart before it &s;eizes it; it will lay it naked, before it &s;tops it. There is no trifling with &s;ome &s;olemnities; no prevaricating with God, when we are on the very thre&s;hold of his pre|&s;ence: Many worldly friend&s;hips di&s;&s;olve away with his breath to whom they were pledged; but thy la&s;t moments, my friend, were &s;o em|ployed as to &s;eal my affection to thy memory clo&s;er than it was ever attached to thy per&s;on;

and I have it now to &s;ay, there was a man, whom I have loved and &s;erved, and who has not deceived or betrayed me."</Q></P>
<P>And what mu&s;t I now think of popularity, when I reflect upon tho&s;e who had it, and upon this man, who had it not? Fallacious te&s;t!&mdash;Contemptible pur&s;uit!

<P>What a contra&s;t to the death I have now been reviewing, occurs to my mind, when I re|flect upon the dreadful con&s;ummation of the once popular <HI>Antithe&uuml;s!</HI> I remember him in the height of his fame, the hero of his party; no man &s;o care&s;&s;ed, followed and applauded: He was a little loo&s;e, his friends would own, in his moral character, but then he was the hone&s;te&s;t fellow in the world; it was not to be denied, that he was rather free in his notions, but then he was the be&s;t creature living. I have &s;een men of the grave&s;t characters wink at his &s;allies, becau&s;e he was &s;o plea&s;ant and &s;o well bred, it was impo&s;&s;ible to be angry with him.

<P>A merchant's daughter of great fortune mar|ried him for love; he ran away with her from a boarding-&s;chool, but her father after a time was reconciled to his &s;on-in-law, and Jack, during the life of the good man, pa&s;&s;ed his time in a &s;mall country hou&s;e on Clapham Common, &s;uperin|tending the concerns of about &s;ix acres of ground; being very expert however in the gar|dens and grape-hou&s;e, and a very &s;ociable fellow over a bottle with the citizen and his friends on a Saturday and Sunday, he became a mighty fa|vourite: All this while he lived upon the be&s;t terms with his wife; kept her a neat little pal|frey, and regularly took his airing on the com|mon by her &s;ide in the mo&s;t uxorious manner: She was in fact a mo&s;t excellent creature, of the &s;weete&s;t temper and milde&s;t manners, &s;o that there &s;eemed no interruption to their happine&s;s, but what aro&s;e from her health, which was of a delicate nature. After a few years the citizen died, and Jack, who&s;e conviviality had given him a helping hand out of the world, found him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very hand&s;ome &s;um of money up|on ca&s;ting up his affairs at his decea&s;e.</P>

longer, and began to form connexions, in which he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary for his wife to have a &s;hare. He now &s;et out upon the pur&s;uit of what the world calls plea&s;ure, and &s;oon found him&s;elf in the company of tho&s;e whom the world calls the Great. He had the addre&s;s to recom|mend him&s;elf to his new acquaintance, and u&s;ed great di&s;patch in getting rid of his old ones: His wife was probably his greate&s;t incumbrance on this occa&s;ion; but Jack po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one art in perfection, which &s;tood him in great &s;tead; he had the ci|ville&s;t way of in&s;ulting that could be imagined; and as the feelings of his wife were tho&s;e of the fonde&s;t &s;u&s;ceptibility, operating upon a weak and delicate con&s;titution, he &s;ucceeded to admiration in tormenting her by neglect, at the &s;ame time that he never gave her a har&s;h expre&s;&s;ion, and in par|ticular, when any body el&s;e was pre&s;ent, behaved him&s;elf towards her in &s;o obliging a manner, that all his acquaintance &s;et him down as the be&s;t tempered fellow living, and her as a lady, by his report, rather captious and querulential. When he had thus got the world on his &s;ide, he detach|ed him&s;elf more and more from her &s;ociety, and became le&s;s &s;tudious to di&s;gui&s;e the in&s;ults he put upon her: She declined fa&s;t in her health, and certain &s;ymptoms began to appear, which convinced Jack that a per&s;everance in his &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="315" REF="326">
would in a &s;hort time lay her in the grave, and leave him without any further mole&s;tation. Her habit was con&s;umptive, for where is the human frame that can long re&s;i&s;t the agony of the heart? In this extremity &s;he reque&s;ted the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a certain phy&s;ician, very eminent in the&s;e ca&s;es: This little gentleman has a way of hitting off the complaints of his patients, which is not always &s;o convenient to tho&s;e expectant parties, who have made up their minds and reconciled them&s;elves to the call of nature. As Jack had one object, and the Doctor another, they did not en|tirely agree in their proce&s;s, and &s;he was &s;ent down by her hu&s;band into a di&s;tant county for the benefit of the air, in a low &s;ituation and a damp hou&s;e. Jack and the phy&s;ician had now a &s;cene of altercation, in which it was evident that the lea&s;t man of the two had the greate&s;t &s;pirit and the large&s;t heart, and Jack certainly put up with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, which could only be pa&s;&s;ed over by perfect innocence or ab&s;olute cowardice: The little Doctor, who had no objection to &s;end Jack out of the world, and a very longing de&s;ire to keep his lady in it, &s;poke like a man who had long been in the practice of holding death at de|fiance; but what Jack lo&s;t in argument he made up in addre&s;s, and after profe&s;&s;ing his acquie&s;cence in the mea&s;ures of his antagoni&s;t, he &s;ilently de|termined
<PB N="316" REF="327">
to pur&s;ue his own, and the Doctor's departure was very &s;oon followed by that of his patient. The dying wife made a feeble &s;tand for a while, but what can a broken heart do again&s;t a hardened one?</P>
<P>After Jack had taken &s;uch zealous pains to over-rule the Doctor's advice, it is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed but he would have accompanied his wife to the place of her de&s;tination, if it had been only for the &s;atisfaction of contemplating the effects of his own greater &s;agacity in her ca&s;e; and he prote&s;ted to her, in the kinde&s;t manner, that nothing &s;hould have robbed him of the plea&s;ure of attending her on the journey, but the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able and unexpected bu&s;ine&s;s: He had ju&s;t then received letters from two friends, which would be attended with the greate&s;t breach of honour, if neglected; and &s;he knew his nicety of principle in tho&s;e affairs: He would not read them to her, as &s;he was in too weak a condition (he ob&s;erved) to attend to bu&s;ine&s;s, but &s;he might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, he would, if po&s;&s;ible, overtake her on the way, or be with her in a few hours after her arrival, for he &s;hould be impatient to be a wit|ne&s;s of her recovery, which he per&s;uaded him&s;elf would &s;oon take place, when &s;he had made ex|periment of the place he had cho&s;en for her. When he had fini&s;hed his apology, his wife
<PB N="317" REF="328">
rai&s;ed her eyes from the ground, where &s;he had fixed them whil&s;t he was &s;peaking, and with a look of &s;uch mild languor, and &s;uch dying &s;oft|ne&s;s, as would almo&s;t have melted marble into pi|ty, mournfully replied&mdash;<HI>farewell!</HI>&mdash;and re&s;igning her&s;elf to the &s;upport of her maid and a nur&s;e, was lifted into her carriage, and left her hu&s;band to pur&s;ue his bu&s;ine&s;s without reproach.</P>
<P>Jack Gayle&s;s now lo&s;t no further time in ful|filling the promi&s;e he had made to his wife, and immediately began to apply him&s;elf to the letters, which had &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably prevented him from paying her tho&s;e kind offices, which her &s;ituation was in &s;o much need of. The&s;e letters I &s;hall now in&s;ert, as &s;ome of my readers may probably think he wants a ju&s;tification on this occa&s;ion. The fir&s;t was from a great lady of unblemi&s;hed reputation, who has a character for public chari|ty and dome&s;tic virtues, which even malice has not dared to impeach. Her lady&s;hip was now at her country &s;eat, where &s;he pre&s;ided at a table of the mo&s;t &s;plendid ho&s;pitality, and regulated a princely e&s;tabli&s;hment with con&s;ummate judg+ment and decorum: In this great family jack had long been a welcome vi&s;iter, and as he had received a thou&s;and kindne&s;&s;es at her hands, gratitude would di&s;po&s;e him to con&s;ider her re|que&s;ts

There was a certain young lady of ea&s;y virtue, who had made a tender impre&s;&s;ion on his heart as he was innocently taking the air in Hyde Park: He had prevailed &s;o far with her as to gain her con&s;ent to an appointment for that day; not fore&s;eeing, as I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, or per|haps not ju&s;t at that moment recollecting his wife's journey, and the call there would be upon him on that account.

<P>The &s;tile of this letter &s;eemed &s;o extraordinary to Jack, and &s;o unlike what he had been u&s;ed to receive from corre&s;pondents of this lady's de|&s;cription, that it is not to be wondered at, if it threw him into a profound meditation: Not that the rebuke made any other impre&s;&s;ion on him, than as it &s;eemed to involve a my&s;tery,

which he could not expound; for it never en|tered into his head to &s;uppo&s;e that the writer was in earne&s;t. In this dilemma he imparted it to a friend, and with his u&s;ual gaiety de&s;ired his help to unriddle it: His friend peru&s;ed it, and with a &s;erious countenance told him he was ac|quainted with the lady, and gave her perfect credit for the &s;incerity of the &s;entiments it con|tained: She was a romantic girl, he told him, and not worth a further thought; but as he per|ceived he was chagrined with the affair, he ad|vi&s;ed him to take po&s;t for the country, and attend the &s;ummons of his noble corre&s;pondent, for that he him&s;elf had always found the di&s;&s;ipation of a journey the be&s;t remedy in all ca&s;es of vexation, like the pre&s;ent. This friendly advice was im|mediately followed by an order for the journey, and Jack Gayle&s;s put him&s;elf into his po&s;t-chai&s;e, with his tarrier by his &s;ide, ordering his groom to follow with Moll Ro&s;s by ea&s;y &s;tages.</P>

<P>Jack was &s;till upon his vi&s;it, when he received the news of her death: This event obliged him to break off from a mo&s;t agreeable party, and take a journey to London; but as the &s;ea&s;on had happened to &s;et in for a &s;evere fro&s;t, and the fox|hounds were confined to their kennel, he had the con&s;olation to reflect that his amu&s;ements were not &s;o much interrupted as they might have been.

many) he hopes they will be found errors of the under&s;tanding, not of the heart: They are the fir&s;t-fruits of his lei&s;ure and retirement; and as the mind of a man in that &s;ituation will natu|rally bring the pa&s;t &s;cenes of active life under its examination and review, it will &s;urely be con&s;idered as a pardonable zeal for being yet &s;erviceable to mankind, if he gives his expe|rience and ob&s;ervations to the world, when he has no further expectations from it on the &s;core of fame or fortune. The&s;e are the real motives for the publication of the&s;e Papers, and this the Author's true &s;tate of mind: To &s;erve the cau&s;e of morality and religion is his fir&s;t ambition; to point out &s;ome u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons for amending the education and manners of young people of either &s;ex, and to mark the evil habits and un|&s;ocial humours of men, with a view to their reformation, are the general objects of his un|dertaking. He has formed his mind to be con|tented with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e hone&s;t endeavours, and with a very moderate &s;hare of &s;ucce&s;s: He has ample rea&s;on notwith&s;tanding to be more than &s;atisfied, with the reception the&s;e Papers have already had in their proba|tionary excur&s;ion; and it is not from any di&s;|gu&s;t, taken up in a vain conceit of his own merits, that he has more than once ob&s;erved
<PB N="325" REF="336">
upon the frauds and follies of popularity, or that he now repeats his opinion, that it is the wor&s;t guide a public man can follow, who wi&s;hes not to go out of the track of hone&s;ty; for at the &s;ame time that he has &s;een men force their way in the world by effrontery, and heard others ap|plauded for their talents, who&s;e only recom|mendation has been their ingenuity in wicked|ne&s;s, he can recollect very few indeed, who have &s;ucceeded, either in &s;ame or fortune, under the di&s;advantages of mode&s;ty and merit.</P>
<P>To &s;uch readers, as &s;hall have taken up the&s;e E&s;&s;ays with a candid di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed, he will not &s;cruple to expre&s;s a hope that they have not been altogether di&s;appointed; for though he has been una&s;&s;i&s;ted in compo&s;ing them, he has endeavoured to open a variety of re&s;ources, &s;en&s;ible that he had many different palates to provide for. The &s;ubject of politics, however, will never be one of the&s;e re&s;ources; a &s;ubject which he has neither the will nor the capacity to meddle with. There is yet another topic, which he has been no le&s;s &s;tudious to avoid, which is per&s;onality; and though he profe&s;&s;es to give occa&s;ional delineations of living manners, and not to make men in his clo&s;et (as &s;ome E&s;&s;ayi&s;ts have done) he does not mean to point at individuals; for as this is a practice
<PB N="326" REF="337">
which he has ever rigidly ab&s;tained from when he mixed in the world, he &s;hould hold him&s;elf without the excu&s;e, even of temptation, if he was now to take it up, when he has withdrawn him&s;elf from the world.</P>
<P>In the E&s;&s;ays (which he has pre&s;umed to call <HI>Literary,</HI> becau&s;e he cannot &s;trike upon any appo&s;ite title of an humbler &s;ort) he has &s;tudied to render him&s;elf intelligible to readers of all de&s;criptions, and the deep-read &s;cholar will not fa&s;tidiou&s;ly pronounce them &s;hallow, only be|cau&s;e he can fathom them with ea&s;e; for that would be to wrong both him&s;elf and their author, who, if there is any vanity in a pedantic margin of references, certainly re&s;i&s;ted that va|nity, and as certainly had it at his choice to have loaded his page with as great a parade of authorities, as any of his brother writers upon cla&s;&s;ical &s;ubjects have o&s;tentatiou&s;ly di&s;played. But if any learned critic, now or hereafter, &s;hall find occa&s;ion to charge the&s;e E&s;&s;ays on the &s;core of fal&s;e authority or actual error, their author will mo&s;t thankfully meet the inve&s;tigation; and the fair Reviewer &s;hall find that he has either candour to adopt correction, or materials enough in re&s;erve to maintain every warrant|able a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The Morali&s;t and the Divine, it is hoped, will
<PB N="327" REF="338">
here find nothing to except again&s;t; it is not likely &s;uch an offence &s;hould be committed by one, who has re&s;ted all his hope in that Revela|tion, on which his faith is founded; whom nothing could ever divert from his aim of turning even the gaye&s;t &s;ubjects to moral pur|po&s;es, and who reprobates the je&s;t, which pro|vokes a laugh at the expence of a blu&s;h.</P>
<P>The E&s;&s;ays of a critical &s;ort are no le&s;s ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the moral objects of compo&s;ition, than to tho&s;e which they have more profe&s;&s;edly in view: They are not undertaken for the invidious purpo&s;e of developing errors, and &s;tripping the laurels of departed poets, but &s;imply for the u&s;es of the living. The &s;pecimens al|ready given, and tho&s;e which are intended to follow in the further pro&s;ecution of the work, are propo&s;ed as di&s;qui&s;itions of in&s;truction rather than of &s;ubtlety; and if they &s;hall be found more particularly to apply to dramatic com|po&s;itions, it is becau&s;e their author looks up to the &s;tage, as the great arbiter of more im|portant delights, than tho&s;e only which con|cern the ta&s;te and talents of the nation; it is becau&s;e he &s;ees with &s;erious regret the buffoonery and low abu&s;e of humour to which it is &s;ink|ing, and apprehends for the con&s;equences &s;uch an influx of folly may lead to. It will be rea|dily
<PB N="328" REF="339">
granted there are but two modes of com|bating this aba&s;ement of the drama with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s: One of the&s;e modes is, by an expo&s;ition of &s;ome one or other of the productions in que&s;tion, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to contribute to its degradation; the other is, by inviting the attention of the public to an exa|mination of better models, in which the &s;tandard works of our early dramati&s;ts abound. If the latter mode therefore &s;hould be adopted in the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, and the former altogether omitted, none of their readers will regret the preference that has been given upon &s;uch an alternative.</P>
<P>If the ladies of wit and talents do not take offence at &s;ome of the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, it will be a te&s;t of the truth of their preten&s;ions, when they di&s;|cern that the raillery, pointed only at affectation and fal&s;e character, has no concern with them. There is nothing in which this nation has more right to pride it&s;elf, than the genius of its women; they have only to add a little more attention to their dome&s;tic virtues, and their &s;ame will fly over the face of the globe. If I had ever known a good match broken off on the part of the man, becau&s;e a young lady had too much mode&s;ty and di&s;cretion, or was too &s;trictly educated in the duties of a good wife, I hope I under&s;tand my&s;elf too well to obtrude
<PB N="329" REF="340">
my old-fa&s;hioned maxims upon them. They might be as witty as they plea&s;ed, if I thought it was for their good; but if a racer, that has too great a &s;hare of heels, mu&s;t lie by becau&s;e it cannot be matched, &s;o mu&s;t every young &s;pin&s;ter, if her wits are too nimble. If I could once di&s;cover that men chu&s;e their wives, as they do their friends, for their manly atchiev|ments and convivial talents, for their being jolly fellows over a bottle, or topping a five-barred gate in a fox-chace, I &s;hould then be able to account for the many Amazonian figures I encounter in &s;louched hats, great-coats and half-boots, and I would not pre&s;ume to &s;et my face again&s;t the fa&s;hion; or if my experience of the fair-&s;ex could produce a &s;ingle in&s;tance in the &s;ect of Sentimentali&s;ts, which could make me doubt of the pernicious influence of a <HI>Mu&s;i|dorus</HI> and a <HI>Lady Thimble,</HI> I would not &s;o ear|ne&s;tly have pre&s;&s;ed the examples of a <HI>Sappho,</HI> a <HI>Calliope</HI> or a <HI>Meli&s;&s;a.</HI></P>
