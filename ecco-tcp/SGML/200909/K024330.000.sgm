<P>Thus have I an extempore Comedy in my hou&s;e, nature not only
  &s;upplying me with matter but &s;cenes and decorations, and here comes a

  Heptarchy, prodigal of plea&s;ure as Henry the 5th with his mad a&s;&s;ociates,
  and e&s;timable as that exemplary prince after he had renounced his

  never &s;ee London, that you &s;hould dine four times a year with the ve&s;try,
  hang a &s;tag's horns in your hall, brew your own October, and roa&s;t an ox at
  Chri&s;t|mas. Mine, I thank him, enjoin'd me no &s;uch con|duct&mdash;he went

<P>Why really, Lucy, this is very unaccountable. I have noticed a
  &s;ort of coolne&s;s between you and your father, but it looked rather like
  unhappine&s;s than anger; let me intercede. You know, Lucy, you are my
  god-daughter, and &s;hould con&s;ider me as a &s;econd father; come, come, be

<P>Sir, I am obliged to you for your advice, but the be&s;t
  precepts are thrown away upon an impractica|ble &s;ubject; you add to my griefs
  by bringing them to my recollection, but when the thorn of affliction rankles
  in the heart, bu&s;y remembrance may irritate, but con|not extract it.</P>

<P>My dear Aurelia, a thou&s;and impertinent things have

<P>In the&s;e arms what Nabob can boa&s;t &s;o exten&s;ive an

<P>Charming!&mdash;you are not a bit like an Indian

<P>Very well, Sir; I'll wait for your ma&s;ter here&mdash;There is
  a noble, bold honour, in the actions of Engli&s;h, which I vainly endeavour to

  blu&s;h, and confe&s;s&mdash;but I hate to be forced into any thing&mdash;we
  &s;hall &s;ee what's to be done.&mdash;So, Engli&s;h, where are the mighty
  perils I was threatened with? every thing here wears an air of tranquillity,
  and the place announces it&s;elf by the title you have given it&mdash;the
  Man&s;ion of Content.</P>

<P>Mr. Rupee, be a&s;&s;ur'd, the ta&s;k I have under|taken is an
  unwilling one; but it proceeds from the pure&s;t e&s;teem&mdash;I &s;hall touch
  you home, but you ought to thank me&mdash;he who has the courage to wring his
  friend's heart, merits more from him, than he who flat|ters his vanity.</P>
