<P>CUSTOM has long given a Preface to every book that has been

always thought the la&s;t made the fir&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary&mdash;Indeed both
may <PB N="4" REF="4"> be di&s;pen&s;ed with, if an author does not think his
&s;tile requires an apology for offering to the Public a work, which his
humility or ju&s;tice may lead him to think fit only to put his readers to
&s;leep&mdash;The greate&s;t part of the public has my permi&s;&s;ion to doze
over the following &s;heets, as I expo&s;e them to the malice of my enemies,
without re&s;erve, merely to oblige many of my friends; who, know|ing I had
taken a long and extraordi|nary journey, have de&s;ired me to give them &s;ome
account of it. The be&s;t I could give, and in the mo&s;t agreeable manner to
my&s;elf, was by tran&s;cribing part of my letters to you&mdash;in which,
though in a cur&s;ory manner, I have gi|ven you a faithful picture of what I
have &s;een. Be&s;ide curio&s;ity, my friends <PB N="5" REF="5"> will in
the&s;e Letters &s;ee at lea&s;t for &s;ome time where the real Lady Craven has
been, and where &s;he is to be found&mdash;it having been a practice for &s;ome
years pa&s;t, for a Birmingham coin of my&s;elf to pa&s;s in mo&s;t of the inns
in France, Switzerland, and England, for the wife of my hu&s;band&mdash;My arms
and coronet &s;ometimes &s;upport|ing, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, this in&s;olent
de|ception; by which, probably, I may have been &s;een to behave very
improperly. I think it my duty to aver upon my ho|nour, that it has frequently
happened to me, travelling with my &s;weet child, to find a landlady, who has
&s;hewn a parti|cular de&s;ire of &s;erving me in the mo&s;t menial offices,
with tears in her eyes, and upon my a&s;king the rea&s;on, in the ho|ne&s;t
indignation of her heart, &s;he &s;aid, <PB N="6" REF="6"> &s;he had been
impo&s;ed upon, at &s;uch a time, by a traveller who called her&s;elf by my

my real brother&mdash;this curious and unheard of trea&s;on to my birth and
character would long &s;ince have been puni&s;hed in the per&s;on who could
only countenance the deceit. But let me thank Heaven that I have found in you,
Sir, all the virtues which I could de&s;ire in a <HI>brother,</HI> and that
affection and re&s;pect which leads me to dedicate the&s;e Letters to you. My
actions in future will prove more than this feeble tribute, how deeply
im|pre&s;&s;ed I am with all the feelings of e&s;|teem that can fill a grateful
heart; your people, Sir, your many virtues, that make <PB N="7" REF="7"> all

<P>THE honour you do me, in wi&s;hing to hear from me, de&s;erves in

for the precious name of &s;i&s;ter, which you order me to take, I &s;hould

<P>I SLEPT at Orleans la&s;t night&mdash;and as the weather is
extremely hot, I re&s;ted in the middle of the day at Blois, where I examined
the Royal <HI>Chateau,</HI> a hou&s;e com|po&s;ed of different orders of
architecture, built at different periods of time, and by various per&s;ons. The
mo&s;t modern ad|dition has been made by Ga&s;ton Duc d'Or|leans, who cho&s;e
to place an Italian &s;truc|ture in the mid&s;t of the various irregu|larity
belonging to the ancient Gothic, one part of which was built by Francis the
Fir&s;t&mdash;The ornaments of this (&s;eve|ral of them) were to me as
incompre|hen&s;ible as Egyptian hieroglyphics would have been. I wi&s;hed my
friend Mr. W. at my elbow, who&s;e knowledge in, and ta&s;te for the Gothic,
might have explained them. The porter who conducted me <PB N="5" REF="13">
about, &s;eemed a good hi&s;torian for a per|&s;on of his condition. I need not
tell you, how many extraordinary per&s;onages and events this <HI>Chateau</HI>
called to my mind. If the confu&s;ion which ambition naturally creates in
hi&s;tory, &s;hould at this moment prevent your memory from placing them before
you&mdash;I refer you to the <HI>Nouveau Voyage de la France, par Mr. Piganiol
de la Force,</HI> who gives a cur&s;ory account of Blois, and this
Chateau&mdash;but he does not &s;ay, what I can a&s;&s;ert, that &s;o many
per|&s;ons have &s;craped the &s;tone on which Henry Duc de Gui&s;e's blood
fell, that there remains but one half of it. My old conductor told me tho&s;e
who pre&s;erved the powder as a relick, were people related to the Gui&s;e
family, and curious travel|lers&mdash;I was not one of them. This let|ter would
be too long if I in&s;erted an ad|venture which happened to me at the po&s;t
beyond Blois. You &s;hall have it in my next. I will only add to this, that if
ever you go from Blois to Tours, do not go by night&mdash;the road is on a
cau&s;eway, the Loire on your left, and a precipice into <PB N="6" REF="14">
meadows on your right, without any fence to prevent an accident, if your
po&s;tillions were drunk, or your hor&s;es frightened.</P>
<P>The uncommon dryne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on prevented my judging of the
much boa&s;ted beauties of the Loire, which is now re|duced to the narrowe&s;t
rivulet I have &s;een&mdash;There are many ca&s;tles on the banks which
ornament the land&s;cape&mdash;and were probably fortified, in former days; one
in particular put me in mind of dear B. Ca&s;tle. I &s;uppo&s;e they are left
now, as mo&s;t habi|tations in France are (di&s;tant from Ver|&s;ailles) for a

<P>AT the po&s;t beyond Blois, while the hor&s;es were changing, (an

ordered my maid to bring me a &s;oup. I had lain half an hour; the room was
dark; and when the door opened, the fir&s;t thing I &s;aw was Ca&s;&s;ius
holding two wax-lights, preceding my maid. He &s;aid, Mademoi&s;elle might go
to her &s;upper, and he would wait upon me, and his countenance had a mixture
of comfort, joy, and gratitude in it, &s;carcely to be &s;een but in the
candour of youth. This morning I had &s;ettled with the mi&s;|tre&s;s of the
inn that &s;he &s;hould agree with a waggoner to take Ca&s;&s;ius &s;afe to
Ro|chelle&mdash;I had given him &s;ome money (too <PB N="11" REF="19"> little

while I was &s;ettling matters with her, one of the old fa&s;hioned French

pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by the church from whence Joan of Are took her invincible
&s;word, placed there by Divine Power. Lillebouchar is only two leagues from
Richelieu; where at the fir&s;t gate of the avaunt-cour two old guards, with
clothes <PB N="21" REF="29"> as ancient as their faces, their bayonets on their
&s;houlders, precede the company to the inner court. Here the concierge &s;hews
fir&s;t, &s;tatues of the Roman emperors and heroes, tolerable copies. The
chapel is next &s;hewn, where there is a picture that plea&s;ed me much, and
which is &s;aid to have been painted by Michael Angelo&mdash;I take it to be a
copy&mdash;It is &s;poiling for want of care&mdash;and I was told mo&s;t of the
good pictures were &s;ent to Paris. I was led through many rooms&mdash;the
palace is immen&s;ely large. One apartment was called the Queen's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the Queen's apartment, and all the rooms, accord|ing to their
de&s;tinations, are &s;hewn.</NOTE>&mdash;It was the Car|dinal's fir&s;t
intention to bring the whole court to Richelieu&mdash;Every beam of wood was
&s;hewn in the cielings of tho&s;e times&mdash;Here they are almo&s;t all
carved and gilt over&mdash;judge of the expence. There is a whole-length
picture of the Cardinal, by an Italian ma&s;ter, and a good one. After being
walked over the hou&s;e, large enough to tire a very able walker, I was offered
<PB N="22" REF="30"> to &s;ee the <HI>Jardins;</HI> but from the windows I had
perceived the ta&s;te of them, and therefore declined that plea&s;ure&mdash;I
ima|gine the rea&s;on why the Cardinal prevented the court from ever coming to
Richelieu, was the &s;ame policy that he introduced, and that exi&s;t even now,
of drawing all the rich nobles from the &s;eats of their
an|ce&s;tors&mdash;involving them in all the ex|pences of the court at
Ver&s;ailles, that they might not feel they had a protection in their
home&mdash;but look for that, and &s;up|port likewi&s;e, from royal favour
alone&mdash;A cunning idea of making the nobles &s;up|port him in his
mea&s;ures, and particularly if he acted contrary to the good of his
country.</P>
<P>The nobles of my country may thank heaven, when they reflect that
they are members of a great nation, enjoying their ancient &s;eats, and
expecting honours and emoluments from the court as they may de&s;erve them from
their country.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="31"> The French noble&s;&s;e, at pre&s;ent, indeed
have a comfort under the weight of debts their fathers may have left
them&mdash;they have a young monarch, generous and ju&s;t&mdash;and I really
believe one of the be&s;t kings that ever exi&s;ted. As his power is

<P>I AM &s;afely arrived here, and to avoid going round &s;ome leagues
I came a cro&s;s-country road; look on your po&s;t-map for Cormery, Loches,
Buxancely, Chateau|roux, Ardante, la Chatre, Montmarau-Culan, Roanne&mdash;But,
dear Sir, follow me only on paper; for the roads in &s;ome places were &s;o
bad, and the lanes &s;o narrow, that my coach is &s;cratched&mdash;and the
drivers, with difficulty per&s;uaded to go to the places I ordered them,
&s;ometimes lo&s;t their way. I went through great part of the
Bourbonnais&mdash;and within ten miles of Vichy, where the king's aunts were
taking the waters. The Auvergne mountains were fine objects to the right. On my
approach|ing Lyons, I felt a great difference in the air&mdash;A warmer climate
was ea&s;ily to be <PB N="26" REF="34"> perceived&mdash;The &s;mall conic
winding hills, round which the country girls with their &s;trange &s;traw hats,
and their di&s;taff at their &s;ide, were conducting their goats as they
&s;pun, formed a land&s;cape new to me&mdash;particularly as the flat roofs to
the cottages gave a lightne&s;s to the buildings that plea&s;ed me
much&mdash;</P>
<P>A &s;imple kind of plough likewi&s;e, drawn by two oxen, brought
that period to my mind, when the Romans were conquering towns, or founding
colonies&mdash;The even|ing coming on, with a &s;tormy &s;ky, made me almo&s;t
fancy that a Roman legion was here and there concealed by the rocks, which
crown almo&s;t every one of the conic hills I have before mentioned, and which
might &s;erve as &s;mall batteries; nay the very clouds, which I often &s;aw
re&s;ting between the hills, might have &s;erved for momentary concealment.</P>

<P>ON the &s;ixteenth I was too much fa|tigued to look at any thing but

in the <HI>Hotel de Ville,</HI> mo&s;tly by Blanchet: his works are &s;poiling
under the cold hands of neglect and time&mdash;The Taurobolum may be very fine,
and much to be admired by all lovers of antiquity; but I, who cannot admire
what I do not think beautiful, looked at it with great indifference&mdash;Spon
and other writers give a learned ac|count of this, and of the bra&s;s-plate on
which is engraved the &s;peech made by Claudius in favour of the town, and
which is le&s;t within the reach of mi&s;chievous boys or idle beggars. The
people of Lyons &s;eem to pay a greater regard to the vanity 
<PB N="29" REF="37"> of the moderns than to the pride of the ancients. I &s;aw
a beautiful &s;arcophagus in a lawyer's court-yard that &s;erved as a
ci&s;tern&mdash;and, in many old walls and hou&s;es, carvings or in&s;criptions
which I wi&s;hed to examine, while the trade&s;men within the&s;e habitations
&s;iared at the &s;trangers, who could be more anxious about ruins than the new
&s;ilks or embroidery they wi&s;hed to &s;ell. I cannot help thinking any
anti|quary might find many more things well worthy of the cabinet of the
curious here than have already been di&s;covered. As to the town's being
hand&s;ome, which I was told it was, I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ert that many parts of it
are po&s;itively frightful; that the hou&s;es are crouded together; each
&s;tory, as it ri&s;es, projecting over the other&mdash;and the &s;treets, as
narrow and &s;tinking as tho&s;e of Paris; but the environs are beautiful, and
it is extremely amu&s;ing to go in a boat every way out of the town&mdash;I
took &s;eve|ral &s;ketches from different points, one from a little i&s;land,
which was formerly called In&s;ula Barbara. You recollect a large round 
<PB N="30" REF="38"> tower which crowns the pri&s;on of Pierre|enci&s;e. The
proportions of it &s;truck my ideas of &s;ymmetry very much&mdash;and after
looking at it for &s;ome time, I landed at the foot of the pri&s;on, and walked
up a hun|dred and twenty &s;teps cut in the rock: the guards let me in very
civilly, and, to my utter &s;urpri&s;e, among the pri&s;oners I found the

<P>I had been told Pierre-enci&s;e was a &s;tate pri&s;on, but it is no
&s;uch thing: it &s;erves as a temporary retreat for people of fa&s;hion who

de|light&mdash;And did you ever ob&s;erve that all the fine pictures in France

my hor&s;e by the <HI>coche d'eau</HI>&mdash;Do not &s;uppo&s;e that my love
for the ancients has totally made me over|look the modern arti&s;ts here; a
Lyonnais merchant, whom I bought &s;ilks of in Lon|don, has &s;hewn me all the

<P>Every ancient building here is &s;tuck upon a rock; and I cannot
help thinking they look like teeth, the rocks &s;erving as roots to
them.&mdash;I was a&s;&s;ured the Saone ran in a different channel from what it
now does, and that it was the Swi&s;s who had cut through the rocks to give the
river its pre&s;ent cour&s;e&mdash;but if it ever was turned, I &s;hould think

<P>DEAR Sir, I thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to give you any de&s;cription
of Avignon, becau&s;e you have been there, but as you did not take the &s;ame
road to it as I did in coming from it, I will endeavour to give you &s;ome
faint idea of a natural curio&s;ity that I have &s;een, and which plea&s;ed me
highly&mdash;the much famed Fontaine de Vau|clu&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;et out from Avignon in the middle of the day, and arrived at a
town called Lille, where I took a French po&s;t chai&s;e, and went in it by the
&s;ide of the Sorgue's clear &s;tream, till the road was too narrow for the
carriage to proceed; I then walked in a narrow path winding <PB N="42" REF="50"> round the immen&s;e rocky mountains to the left, with the &s;tream
rapidly flying by me to the right about a mile, till a ca|vern, pretty much in
the &s;hape of tho&s;e which lions come out of in an opera, pre|&s;ented
it&s;elf to my view, and from that flows the river. I am told it is an
unfathom|able aby&s;s. Why it is called a <HI>Fontaine,</HI> I am at a lo&s;s
to gue&s;s.</P>
<P>Mon&s;trous rocks ri&s;e over and on each &s;ide of this craggy
arch; the&s;e &s;eem to bend forward to meet or cru&s;h the
cu|rious.&mdash;Which ever way I turned my eyes, I &s;aw gigantic and
fanta&s;tic &s;hapes, which nature &s;eems to have placed there to
a&s;|toni&s;h the gazer with a mixture of the me|lancholy, terrible, and
cheerful; for the clearne&s;s and rapidity of the river make it a lively
object, and where there is a flat place on the banks, though not above a few
feet in circumference, the pea&s;ants have planted trees or &s;owed
gardens&mdash;you lift up your eyes, and &s;ee the mo&s;t perfect contra&s;ts
to them&mdash;the birds, which hovered towards the upper part of the

cavern, it appears horrible and gloomy; I could almo&s;t have fancied the river
ran thus fa&s;t, rejoiced to quit the man&s;ion from whence it &s;prung. No
won|der Petrarch's &s;ong was plaintive, if he courted his mu&s;e with this
&s;cene perpetually before his eyes; Love and all his laughing train mu&s;t fly
the human imagination, where nature di&s;plays her features in the maje&s;tic
and terrible &s;tile, and I was very glad to find &s;o good an excu&s;e as this
&s;ituation for Petrarch's eternal complaint&mdash;till now I was puzzled to
gue&s;s, how a man of his &s;en&s;e could pa&s;s the greate&s;t part of his
life in eternizing a lady's contempt of a faithful pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;but I now
believe there was no Laura&mdash;or if there exi&s;ted one, he found in either
ca&s;e his imagination parti|cularly turned to poetry, and that of the
melancholy kind, in this, probably his &s;ummer's re&s;idence. I, who you know

takes its winter-cour&s;e: as I &s;aw it, it creeps humbly from the cavern
under part of the rock, and becomes rapid as it finds its level and forms a

<P>I was informed by the inhabitants of Vauclu&s;e, that people, who

before, the water is unfathomable; upon this information, I a&s;ked if bodies

<P>I HAVE examined the rocks ju&s;t out of this harbour, and think
&s;ome of them mo&s;t fortunately &s;ituated to defend the port, but what
&s;urpri&s;ed me much, was being a&s;&s;ured by the boatmen who row me out
twice a day (to get a breath of air) that, at all times of the night, boats are
&s;uffered to come in and out of the harbour with|out being examined
&mdash;</P>
<P>People of all nations, that fili every day the great walk leading to
the quay, made me think on my arrival that &s;ome impor|tant event had drawn
all the people from the hou&s;es and the &s;hips together&mdash;but a
repetition of the &s;ame &s;cene &s;oon convinced me of my mi&s;take. There are
two very <PB N="48" REF="56"> fine pictures, painted by Puget, repre&s;ent|ing
&s;ome of the horrid &s;cenes at the time of the plague at Mar&s;eilles; they
are only too well executed; I &s;aw &s;everal dying figures taking leave of
their friends and looking their la&s;t anxious kind and wi&s;hful prayer on
their &s;ick infants, that made the tears flow down my cheeks&mdash;I was told
the phy&s;icians and noblemen who were a&s;|&s;i&s;ting the &s;ick and dying
were all portraits. I can ea&s;ily conceive it, for in &s;ome of the faces
there is a look of reflexion and con|cern which could only be drawn from the
life&mdash;</P>
<P>I have &s;poke to Captain &mdash;, who com|mands the King-Fi&s;her;
he is obliged to perform quarantine here, though he had already done his duty
in that way at Leg|horn and Genoa before; but the plague rages very much all
along the Barbary coa&s;t, from whence he is come; and one cannot be
&s;urpri&s;ed at any precaution taken at Mar&s;eilles to avoid this
danger&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="57"> I do not think Mar&s;eilles a beautiful town;

<P>I STOPPED in my way here at Toulon, and intended to look at the
dock-yards, but was refu&s;ed, which &s;urpri&s;ed me very much, as an
Engli&s;h lady of my acquain|tance was &s;uffered to go into them at the time
of the la&s;t war with France, when her hu&s;band and all the gentlemen with
her were &s;ent out of the town&mdash;I could get no other rea&s;on
a&s;&s;igned for the refu&s;al, but this&mdash;that &s;ince Lord &mdash; had
&s;een them, nothing of <HI>Engli&s;h blood</HI> &s;hould ever be permitted to
go into them. So I walked about, and all I could &s;ee was that the fine&s;t
ports in the world, and &s;hips worthy of being commanded by our admirals, will
never make (at lea&s;t for a great while to come) good &s;ailors of the
French&mdash;my rea|&s;ons I will tell you, when we meet. &mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="59"> Mr. de S&mdash;, who refu&s;es to let any
Engli&s;h per&s;on &s;ee the dock-yards at Toulon, expre&s;&s;ed a great
di&s;like to our nation, &s;aying he had rea&s;on; you will laugh when I tell
you, that his rea&s;on for hating us is, that in the late war two thirds of his
&s;quadron were taken, with the greate&s;t part of his convoy, de&s;tined for
the Ea&s;t-Indies, and had he not bravely ran away him&s;elf, he would
certainly have fallen a prey to tho&s;e <HI>opiniatres, feroces matelots</HI>
as he calls our &s;ailors&mdash;</P>
<P>The gentleman who waited upon Sou|langes to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion and
plead my cau&s;e, wi&s;hing to recollect what defence Mr. de Soulange's
&s;quadron had made, a&s;ked an officer in the room the name of the French
&s;hips, which the poor Mr. de Soulanges &s;o bitterly lamented, he an&s;wered
he &s;hould recollect them if he heard their names, but could not exactly
remember&mdash;</P>
<P>My friend a&s;ked if it was&mdash;the Ville de Paris, le
Glorieux&mdash;le Centaur&mdash;l'Ar|tois&mdash;le

Pega&s;e&mdash;here the gentleman &s;tared at him, and &s;aid, le Pega&s;e was
one of them&mdash;</P>
<P>Soulanges &s;aid, yes, but the Foudroyant that took her was one of
the large&s;t &s;hips in our navy, and commanded by that <HI>feroce
matelot</HI> Captain Jervais, who would attack the devil, if he met him at
&s;ea; but, added he, Jervais could not have taken the <HI>Pega&s;e,</HI>
unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted by other &s;hips&mdash;</P>
<P>My friend told him, the Foudroyant was a two decker and carried only
&s;ix more guns than the Pega&s;e, and was taken in the war before the la&s;t,
by the Engli&s;h &s;hip the Monmouth, commanded by Captain Gardiner, that
carried but 64 guns&mdash;that, though he had not the plea|&s;ure of being
per&s;onally known to Captain Jervais, from his public character he was &s;ure
he would do his be&s;t in time of war to burn, &s;ink, or take the devil, if
under French colours&mdash;He had a great incli|nation to have told Mr. de
Soulanges what is very well known, that Captain Jervais took the Pega&s;e after
an action of little <PB N="53" REF="61"> more than half an hour, without any
help what&s;oever, but his commands to a gal|lant crew&mdash;and that the other
&s;ail of the line under Soulange's command &s;truck to the Queen, Captain
Maitland, after re|ceiving a &s;ingle broad&s;ide; but he thought a repetition
of naval actions, fairly &s;tated, might be painful to many officers who were
pre&s;ent, and who paid the tribute due to our navy, in expre&s;&s;ing the
highe&s;t e&s;teem for it; and &s;o took his leave.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pega&s;e</HI> in que&s;tion is the very &s;hip my brother
commanded la&s;t war. I have often been told that &s;he could not &s;ail, by
the French&mdash;but I always a&s;&s;ured them, that &s;he has profited &s;o
much by the trim he gave her, that &s;he goes now perfectly well&mdash;</P>
<P>They have al&s;o talked much of the im|provement made in their
marine the la&s;t war; but unle&s;s it is in the cloathing their &s;hips'
company, I cannot find out in what&mdash;Old Engli&s;h officers have told me,
they always found their hearts lay in the <PB N="54" REF="62"> &s;ame place as
heretofore&mdash;and that when|ever they could &s;ail fa&s;t enough to get
along &s;ide of the enemy, the bu&s;ine&s;s was pre|&s;ently &s;ettled&mdash;I
think I need no better proof of this a&s;&s;ertion than one, which I hope may
&s;tand unaltered in the book of Fame for centuries to come; it is
this&mdash;our marine is in part compo&s;ed of line-of-battle &s;hips taken
from our enemies; whereas there exi&s;ts not a power upon the face of the globe
that can boa&s;t of having in their marine one &s;hip of the line taken from
the Briti&s;h nation&mdash;</P>
<P>I do not doubt but that the <HI>Mini&s;tre de la marine de
France,</HI> and French officers, are excellent naval officers in
theory&mdash;but when that is to be put in practice, I hope events will prove,
that we remember we have no other ramparts to defend our coun|try and our
liberties but the ocean, and that we ever were, are, and mu&s;t be, a race of
<HI>feroces, opiniatres, matelots</HI>&mdash;You &s;ay amen to this wi&s;h, I
am &s;ure&mdash;&s;o remain yours mo&s;t affectionately.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="63"> I think the drive from Mar&s;eilles to Toulon
is beautiful&mdash;the rocks are as &s;tu|pendous and nearly as fanta&s;tic as
tho&s;e about Vauclu&s;e, and for &s;ome miles they are covered with fir
trees&mdash;</P>
<P>You may form &s;ome idea of the magni|tude of the hills and rocks by
my prote&s;t|ing, that the trees and a few cottages which adorn them, look, the
fir&s;t like tooth-picks, and the latter like the &s;malle&s;t Dutch
toys&mdash;the road winds round mo&s;t gracefully; wherever there was a little
valley, I &s;aw large flocks of goats&mdash;As I came nearer to Toulon, I began
to &s;ee many orange and pomegranate trees in the gardens; and the caper, which
is a pretty but &s;tinking creeper, grows wild, wherever it is permitted to
take root&mdash;</P>
<P>From Toulon to Hyeres I was gradually appri&s;ed of the charming
&s;ituation of the latter place, by the approach to it, which grew more and
more lovely every &s;tep I took&mdash;The hedges on the road are com|po&s;ed of
myrtle, pomegranate, and wild <PB N="56" REF="64"> vine; I pa&s;&s;ed by
&s;everal neat-looking white hou&s;es, the gardens of which are full of large
orange trees.</P>
<P>The town of Hyeres is about a league from the &s;ea, placed on the
&s;ide of a hill. I &s;hall wait patiently here for that letter I expected at
Mar&s;eilles&mdash;This happy &s;pot is refre&s;hed by &s;ea-breezes&mdash;and

ignorance and &s;implicity amu&s;ed me very much; but I pity tho&s;e who
tru&s;t to his phy&s;ical knowledge; I gave him &s;ome very curious receipts,
all impromptu, as you may gue&s;s, a&s;&s;uring him, among other things, that
bathing people in aqua fortis was an in|fallible remedy for the di&s;order he
cured&mdash;</P>

objects, and a penin|&s;ula called Gien which is joined to the land only by a
narrow road, forms a land&s;cape worthy of a great ma&s;ter's pencil&mdash;On
looking towards the land, mountains on every &s;ide, who&s;e tops are decorated
with firs and rocks alternately, and towards the bottom, with olive, orange,

prevent the &s;ea from extend|ing any farther&mdash;At a little di&s;tance,

<P>DEAR Sir! I am extremely &s;urpri&s;ed that invalids, who fly to the
&s;outh in winter, do not choo&s;e Hyeres in pre|ference to Montpellier or
Nice; it is true that it is more &s;olitary than either of the&s;e places; but
I am &s;ure, by the ac|counts I have had of the la&s;t, its lying,
go&s;&s;iping, mi&s;chievous &s;tile of the &s;ociety mu&s;t be a mo&s;t horrid
thing for nerves &s;ha|ken by illne&s;s. There is an uncommon clearne&s;s in
the air here; the i&s;lands ap|pear to the eye to be not above three miles
di&s;tant, and I am a&s;&s;ured they are &s;even leagues&mdash;Provi&s;ions are
excellent here, par|ticularly fi&s;h; among the&s;e, the John-dory and the red
Mullet are of an amazing &s;ize, and excellent; I thought the Dory was called
the Dorade, but it is called the Poi&s;&s;on de St. <PB N="74" REF="82">
Pierre; and the Dorade, of which there is plenty, is a very indifferent
fi&s;h&mdash;They &s;poil the red Mullet by con&s;tantly pulling out the
livers. The land is too precious here to be &s;pared for building, yet there
are hou&s;es enough to lodge &s;e|veral families&mdash;</P>
<P>There is very &s;eldom any rain at Hyeres, and the rides of the
environs are the mo&s;t beautiful that your imagination can
form&mdash;particularly one towards the re&s;idence of a Mr. Glapiere de St.
Trop&eacute;s&mdash;who has near his hou&s;e a beautiful large valley between
the mountains, which he might with little expence turn into a charming park
with a river running through it&mdash;You mo&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e from the want
of rain here, that there is no verdure, or that the orange-gardens look burnt
by the &s;un; the natives of this happy &s;pot are extremely in|genious in
turning every little &s;pring that comes from the mountains (and the&s;e
&s;prings are numerous) over their fields and gardens, &s;o that the con&s;tant
want of rain here is <PB N="75" REF="83"> the very rea&s;on why every
vegetation ne|ver fails of being refre&s;hed perpetually.&mdash;</P>
<P>Put all the&s;e circum&s;tances together, with another, which I
think mu&s;t weigh with every rea&s;onable per&s;on, out of their own country,
which is, that provi&s;ions are very cheap, and you will agree with me, that
Hyeres is a very good place for an invalid to pa&s;s a winter in.&mdash;</P>

them&mdash;I have had the greate&s;t plea&s;ure in looking at
&s;ome&mdash;there are two Vandykes in one of the Brignoli palaces, that I
think invaluable. The man is on a grey hor&s;e, the lady his wife, is a whole
length&mdash;there is as much grace and beauty in her face and figure, as his
pencil could expre&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>All the magnificence of the Genoe&s;e is confined to their palaces;
by their laws, they cannot have gold either on their clothes, carriages, or
liveries. The chief amu&s;ement of ladies here is walking the &s;treets in the
evening, with their &s;edan|chair and &s;everal &s;ervants behind them,
ac|companied by one or more gentlemen&mdash;it is very much the fa&s;hion
likewi&s;e, for every per&s;on who can afford it, to have one or &s;everal
country-hou&s;es&mdash;as they call them; but the &s;ituations of them, perched
about the &s;teep rocks, gives me but little idea of the country. The people in
general do not <PB N="85" REF="93"> look healthy&mdash;All the women wear what
is called a mezzaro, viz. about two yards or more of black &s;ilk or chintz,
wrapped about their heads and &s;houlders, in&s;tead of a cloak, it is
extremely graceful, if well put on. Every woman has an opportunity of hiding a
defect, or &s;hewing a beauty, as they may conceal one eye, the throat, the
forehead, the chin, or in &s;hort &s;uffer tho&s;e they meet to &s;ee only what
they choo&s;e to di&s;play. The mezzaro too has a great con|venience, which is,
that a woman can &s;o hide her&s;elf in it, that &s;he may walk all over the
town unknown; this mezzaro is particularly advantageous to a per&s;on with fine
&s;houlders and eyes. There are but two &s;treets in the town where carriages
can go; &s;o that &s;edan chairs or walking are the principal methods of going
from one place to another.&mdash;</P>
<P>The females among the lower cla&s;s di&s;|gu&s;ted me much by their
head-dre&s;s&mdash;their hair is &s;trained up to a point on the top of their
head, and fa&s;tened to a pin&mdash;judge what a figure an old greyheaded or
bald woman mu&s;t make.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="94"> I cannot help thinking this once flouri&s;h|ing
republic, notwith&s;tanding the opulence of &s;ome of its noble families, is
becoming very fa&s;t a dependent on, or a creature of the court of France. Some
of their nobles marry into French families&mdash;and &s;oon lo&s;e their
fortune and their patriotic ideas in the extravagance and &s;ervility of that
court&mdash;Cor&s;ica is a melancholy proof of this opi|nion&mdash;</P>
<P>Of the two noble Genoe&s;e, to whom I had letters, the lady is dead,
and the gen|tleman is not here; &s;o that I have announc|ed my&s;elf no where,
as I would not be de|tained here longer than ju&s;t to &s;ee the churches and
pictures, and though I &s;hould have been plea&s;ed to have &s;een the manner
of living of the Genoe&s;e nobles, I would not upon any account get into a
train of mi|ni&s;ters dinners and vi&s;its&mdash;</P>
<P>I have been much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a black Virgin and child in
one of the churches here: unle&s;s it be to tempt Negroes to turn Chri&s;tians.
I cannot conceive why they &s;uf|fer it to remain&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="95"> I have been on board the
<HI>Gal&eacute;res</HI>&mdash;and if the variety of very fine pictures have
de|lighted me, the &s;ight of heavy chains, and &s;o many human beings enduring
&s;lavery for years, has &s;hocked me beyond de&s;cription; yet they do not
look unhappy; and I think &s;ervitude a more rational puni&s;hment for &s;ome
crimes than death; but &s;lavery to an Engli&s;h mind, I &s;uppo&s;e, mu&s;t be
very horrible by what I feel&mdash;</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday two Algerine &s;laves came to my apartment to &s;ell
&s;lippers; the olde&s;t of the two was one of the hand&s;ome&s;t brown men,
with the be&s;t countenance I ever &s;aw; he has been a &s;lave five-and-twenty
years, and is &s;uffered to go about without the u&s;ual attendant, which is a
man with a &s;tout &s;tick in his hand, who follows the &s;laves who walk about
the town chained together, always in pairs&mdash;</P>
<P>When I thought upon the fate of this old man; guilty of no crime; a
pri&s;oner of war; his looks &s;o noble and &s;o hone&s;t; I wept, and wi&s;hed
I might have had intere&s;t <PB N="88" REF="96"> enough with the Doge and
Senate of Genoa to have &s;ent him home to Al|giers&mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ort of pictures in real life, are of a dark hue: I mu&s;t
therefore again turn to tho&s;e I have &s;een in the palaces; I confe&s;s I
&s;hould not di&s;like to pa&s;s three winter months here to examine them at
lei&s;ure, and copy a few. There is a bu&s;t of Vitellius in one of the
palaces, for which I am a&s;&s;ured the Duke of Marlborough offered to give its
weight in gold. The &s;um mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been very large, for the
bu&s;t is &s;o ma&s;&s;y that it probably weighs above half any other marble
&s;tatue: But it does much honour to the duke's ta&s;te, as the work is
perfect; and much likewi&s;e to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, to prize &s;o highly
what de&s;erves &s;o well to be e&s;teemed. I have been offered any price I
choo&s;e to a&s;k for a che&s;tnut Suffolk-hor&s;e here; the &s;table it is in
is crowd|ed every day, and it grieves &s;ome of the Genoe&s;e very much that I
will not part with him; but I think a good woman's <PB N="89" REF="97"> hor&s;e
is &s;o difficult to be had, that I never can under&s;tand how any per&s;on can
part with one&mdash;</P>

<P>I Set out again in a felucca, intending to land at Leghorn, but
contrary winds or calms became &s;o tire&s;ome to me, that I landed at an
Italian port called Via regia, had my coach taken out, and &s;et out by land
for this place. I have pa&s;&s;ed through a fore&s;t of oaks, belonging to the
Grand Duke.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e oaks are the large&s;t and fine&s;t looking
timber-trees I ever &s;aw; I am a&s;&s;ured here the wood is not hard and good,
like our Engli&s;h oak; if &s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e it is affected by the
climate&mdash;</P>
<P>I could not help reflecting in one of the fine&s;t palaces at Genoa
on the want of unity and order, the two principles on <PB N="91" REF="99">
which good ta&s;te is founded, that is ever di&s;covered in the dre&s;s and
ornaments of all kinds which foreigners have&mdash;</P>
<P>I had pa&s;&s;ed through an immen&s;e &s;uite of rooms, each more
magnificent than the other; when coming into the bed-chamber of the
mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, her dre&s;s which &s;he had pulled off the night
before, even her bracelets and rings lay upon a table, and I can with truth
a&s;&s;ert, no village-girl could have adorned her&s;elf with more mean,
ordinary, paltry finery than was exhi|bited. The heir to this noble hou&s;e, a
child of about two years old, that had taken a fancy to my looks, and
accompanied me through the apartments, was dre&s;&s;ed like|wi&s;e in a
coar&s;e coloured linen&mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances were &s;uch contra&s;ts to the hou&s;e, that
it brought to my mind a hundred examples of the like in France, where often, to
get at the mo&s;t elegant <HI>Salle de Compagnie,</HI> you are obliged to
pa&s;s through a dirty antichamber, where you are forced to hold up your
petticoats, <PB N="92" REF="100"> that you may not &s;weep in to the inner
rooms a load of filth. In the &s;treets you meet a magnificent carriage,
attended by &s;ervants in co&s;tly liveries, drawn by a pair of dog-hor&s;es,
the harne&s;s of which a hack|ney-coachman would not u&s;e with us; and
frequently at Paris the fine&s;t hotels have their architecture di&s;graced by
the black funnel of a temporary chimney, run|ning out at a window or through a
cor|nice&mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e incongruities cannot be imagined, nor believed, but by
tho&s;e that have &s;een them. With us cleanline&s;s con&s;titutes our fir&s;t
elegance; and fitne&s;s of things is next con&s;idered; and I believe it is the
combi|nation of the&s;e two circum&s;tances which enchants foreigners of
&s;en&s;e and parts &s;o much in England&mdash;</P>
<P>The Grand Duke and Duche&s;s are here, &s;o that the apartments
u&s;ually let out to company are taken up by them and their &s;uite&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="101"> I have hired a comfortable hou&s;e here by the
week; the&s;e baths, fir&s;t built by the Roman Emperors, are kept in excellent
re|pair; and well they may, for the bathing is exce&s;&s;ively dear&mdash;</P>
<P>There is a public room at the palace, where the company a&s;&s;emble
about nine in the evening; the heat in the day is exce&s;|&s;ive; all the
Italians lie down and &s;leep after dinner, and get up to dre&s;s about &s;ix,
walk afterwards, and meet in the great room. I met the Grand Duche&s;s la&s;t
night, with another lady; I had not the lea&s;t idea who &s;he was, being
followed by a &s;ingle foot|man in grey; &s;he looked at me with the greate&s;t
attention, and curt&s;ied very civil|ly; I curt&s;ied and &s;tared at her, from
her extreme likene&s;s to my cou&s;in of witty me|mory, the late lady

<P>I was pe&s;tered to death with que&s;tions about my harp at night. I
find a harp with pedals is a very rare thing in Italy, and an Engli&s;h
per&s;on meets with homage little &s;hort of adoration. The very &s;hopkeepers 
<PB N="94" REF="102"> and pea&s;ants look in my face and

<P>I Have rode over to Pi&s;a, where I have been much entertained; the
cathedral, the bapti&s;tery, and the Campo Santo are well worthy a voyage from
England&mdash;</P>
<P>The leaning tower, which you may probably have &s;een, or at lea&s;t
read and heard many accounts of, is a proof, among many others, that in all
ages fancy is too often mi&s;taken for ta&s;te&mdash;It has the appearance of
patchwork, from the variety of orders of architecture di&s;played in the
pillars, which &s;tand in rows one above the other, from the ba&s;e to the
top&mdash;As to the learned in building pretending to &s;ay the tower was built
leaning, only to &s;hew the excellence of the workman&s;hip, they 
<PB N="96" REF="104"> certainly delude them&s;elves, or de&s;ire to im|po&s;e
upon credulous per&s;ons&mdash;There are many proofs of the ground having
&s;unk; one infallible, according to my judgment; and that is, the fir&s;t row
of pillars being above half buried in the earth&mdash;This tower &s;tands by
it&s;elf&mdash;&s;ome paces from it I entered the cathedral through bra&s;s
doors brought from Jeru&s;alem, repre&s;ent|ing, in relievo, the hi&s;tory of
Chri&s;t&mdash;but I would prefer the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one pannel of the
folding doors on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the cathedral to the whole of
the&s;e; for the modern relievo, executed by John of Bologna, is full of grace
and nature; while the ancient &s;eems chi&s;eled out by an awkward
carpenter&mdash;There is a beau|tiful urn placed on a pillar on the out&s;ide
of the church, which was &s;hewn formerly as the cup which mea&s;ured the
tribute paid to Cae&s;ar&mdash;but that mi&s;take is now rec|tified, and the
true ancient u&s;e re&s;tored to it&mdash;it contained the a&s;hes of &s;ome
illu&s;tri|ous per&s;onage&mdash;A fine &s;arcophagus is likewi&s;e placed at
the door of the cathe|dral, as a monument to the Comte&s;&s;e 
<PB N="97" REF="105"> Matilda&mdash;who was &s;overeign of this
coun|try&mdash;and is &s;aid piou&s;ly to have added much to the magnificence
of the&s;e buildings&mdash;but the croi&s;ades have afforded their mo&s;t
curious relics&mdash;</P>
<P>I refer you to books for a preci&s;e and minute account of all that
is to be &s;een in this va&s;t and magnificent cathedral; I have only time to
give you a few ob&s;er|vations&mdash;</P>
<P>The chief altar is compo&s;ed mo&s;tly of lapis lazuli and all that
is rare and co&s;tly&mdash;Some of the pictures are fine, but the ca|thedral is
too dark to permit them to be &s;een to advantage&mdash;At the lower end is a
hand&s;ome &s;arcophagus to the memory of the Emperor Henry VII. who was
poi&s;oned by a prie&s;t at the holy table with a con&s;c|crated
wafer&mdash;</P>
<P>I quitted the Cathedral to go into the Bapti&s;tery, a building
&s;tanding like the tower at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the cathedral; it is
&s;haped like a hand&s;ome bell&mdash;the fir&s;t and <PB N="98" REF="106">
&s;econd row of pillars on the out&s;ide of this, one above the other, are in a
good &s;tile; but the man dying without leaving a drawing, or plan of his
intentions towards the fini&s;hing, the upper part is fini&s;hed in the gothic
&s;tile, and ill done&mdash;</P>
<P>There are granite pillars at the entrance, very fine
indeed&mdash;</P>
<P>The front is very remarkable, it is im|men&s;ely large, of white
marble, beautiful Mo&s;aic &s;culpture in different pannels, which &s;urround
the out&s;ide&mdash;and the de|&s;ign of every one differs from the others,
&s;o that there are not two alike&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;culpture too of the pulpit is very fine; it repre&s;ents a
groupe of per&s;onages&mdash;I was told they were all portraits&mdash;many of
the faces are ridiculous caricaturas&mdash;but &s;ome barbarous travellers have
plucked off &s;everal of the heads; a thing ea&s;ily done by a &s;trong hand,
as they are not &s;o large as my fi&s;t, when doubled; if <PB N="99" REF="107">
you have never &s;een that, you may gue&s;s at the &s;ize from what I
&s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P>The Campo Santo is earth brought from Jeru&s;alem, which had the
&s;ingular pro|perty of de&s;troying the dead bodies put into it,
four-and-twenty hours after they had lain there. It was the burying-place of
the noble Pi&s;ans, when Pi&s;a was a flou|ri&s;hing republic; at pre&s;ent no
u&s;e is made of it; it is an oblong &s;quare built round with a cloi&s;ter;
the length is three hundred and fifty feet, in the center is depo&s;ed the holy
earth, round which reign Gothic arches forming doors and windows, the&s;e
arches are &s;o light and &s;imple, that they &s;eem to hold together by magic
power; and if any thing could reconcile me to the Gothic, the&s;e arches would:
again&s;t the wall on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide from the cloi&s;ter, there are the
remains of a painting <HI>en fre&s;que</HI> upon the pla&s;ter, which is very
fine.&mdash;This pla&s;ter or &s;tucco is broken off in &s;everal places, and
di&s;covers that the outlines of the painting were done upon the wall,
be|&s;ore the &s;tucco was laid on; this appears <PB N="100" REF="108">
perfectly incomprehen&s;ible, as the &s;tucco is thick, and can never have been
tran&s;parent&mdash;but I am affured that the red lines un|derneath, which
appear to me to be com|mon chalk pencil, were done with a com|po&s;ition which
pierced through the &s;tucco when wet, in a faint line, the only way of
accounting for this &s;ingular circum&s;tance&mdash;I confe&s;s the drawing on
the wall is done with &s;o much more freedom and boldne&s;s than the painting
expre&s;&s;es, that I wi&s;hed all the &s;tucco fallen off, that I might &s;ee
all the &s;pirit of the de&s;ign at once.&mdash;As I walked back through the
town, I was &s;hewn an ugly &s;trange-&s;haped tower, where Ugo|lino and his
innocent family were &s;tarved to death&mdash;As I looked at it, I thought,
that if every man in the&s;e days, who did not exert his utmo&s;t abilities to
&s;ave his country, was &s;tarved to death, there might be formed a large
regiment of good cooks wanting employment&mdash;</P>
<P>The gra&s;s grows in every &s;treet in the town; a melancholy proof
of the &s;ad rever&s;e <PB N="101" REF="109"> this city exhibits to that
picture it once gave the admiring world&mdash;</P>
<P>There are many remarkable mouments placed in the cloi&s;ters of the
Campo Santo. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia has erected one in memory of
Algarotti&mdash;I cannot po&s;&s;ibly give you a li&s;t of them&mdash;I only
mean to be your finger po&s;t, ju&s;t to point out to you what is worth
&s;eeing, if chance or choice &s;hould lead you this way&mdash;</P>

<P>SINCE I wrote la&s;t, I have been to &s;ee Lucca&mdash;a virgin
republic, for it has never lo&s;t its liberty. The motto over the gates, or
wherever it can be placed, is <HI>Libertas.</HI> The territories belonging to
it are only for|ty-&s;ix miles long from St. Pellegrins to the Pi&s;an
mountains, and nineteen from Via regia to Porquetto, the half of which town
belongs to the Tu&s;can dominion&mdash;</P>
<P>Lucca is extremely well fortified; crouds of people in the &s;treet,
and a look of opu|lence among the <HI>bourgeoi&s;ie</HI> prove the good effect
of their motto. The oil is remark|ably good here. I was &s;hewn the Cathedral,
which has nothing very remarkable in it but a circular chapel, the &s;hape of
which is <PB N="103" REF="111"> plea&s;ing, and it has four &s;tatues of the
Apo&s;tles, good. I was told this chapel, dedicated to the Virgin, was
tran&s;ported in one night, entire, from another church at &s;ome di&s;tance.
The figure of the Virgin I could not &s;ee, it was covered up; &s;he wears
con&s;tantly golden &s;lippers, and there is a &s;kull of one of the &s;enators
of Lucca, who was hung for &s;tealing one of them, though he declared that
&s;he flung it at him, as he was praying at her feet for more wealth&mdash;</P>
<P>I met in the inn &mdash;, whom I cer|tainly &s;hould not have
recollected again, his countenance is &s;o altered: I believe the Mu&s;es
&s;hould not marry, and he certainly is one &mdash;</P>
<P>There is &s;omething romantic and <HI>pitto|re&s;que</HI> in the
manner of training the vines here. In the low grounds they twine round the
trees which &s;urround the little enclo&s;ures, and hang in fe&s;toons from one
tree to another. The oxen too are of a particular kind, very large, and of no
other colour but a light grey; in a &s;mall field I <PB N="104" REF="112"> have
&s;een the&s;e yoked to a plough, prepar|ing one corner of it for corn, while
the re&s;t was filled with melons, olive, and fig-trees: I am told the &s;un is
powerful enough to bring the fruits of the earth to perfection through the
branches of the trees; if &s;o, they are extremely carele&s;s in making their
wine; there is little or none to be bought good.&mdash;</P>
<P>I do not know what people mean by &s;ay|ing Italy is a beautiful
country; a want of fine trees and turf makes it in general very ugly. If
travellers would content them|&s;elves with &s;aying, that in Italy, a per&s;on
who is pa&s;&s;ionately fond of the fine arts might find con&s;tant
amu&s;ement, I believe the prai&s;e would be ju&s;t; but when led by their
enthu&s;ia&s;m for them, they &s;ay, Italy is the fine&s;t country in the
world, they prepare many people, as ea&s;y in their faith as I am, to be as
much di&s;appointed as I have been&mdash;</P>
<P>A lady on a &s;ide-&s;addle is an object of great wonder here; the
pea&s;ants who pa&s;s <PB N="105" REF="113"> me on the right hand, when I am on
hor&s;e|back, the women, particularly, &s;ay, <HI>Pove|rina&mdash;Je&s;u
Maria&mdash;Povera&mdash;una gambia&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>They actually fancy I have one leg only; their &s;tare of concern
always makes me laugh; and then they add <HI>cara</HI> to their la|mentations.
In a day or two I &s;hall &s;et out for Florence, from whence I &s;hall write
to you. I confe&s;s I long to &s;ee the Venus de Medicis, and the Niobe family.
I do not envy the Grand Duke his &s;overeignty; but his collection of

<P>I &s;et out from the Pi&s;a baths on the 23d in the afternoon; I
&s;ent on my coach and &s;ome of my &s;ervants two po&s;ts, and went on
hor&s;eback my&s;elf: when I got about half way, I pa&s;&s;ed by a gentleman in

the left &s;ide of the phaeton as fa&s;t as my hor&s;e could go, 
<PB N="108" REF="116"> with my hat and head &s;o low, that the fooli&s;h man
could not &s;ee me. My hor&s;e is a mo&s;t excellent and fleet one, and I kept
him on till my pur&s;uer gave up the cha&s;e; and I then, when out of his
&s;ight, turned into a farm-yard, and hid my&s;elf, till I &s;aw the phaeton
pa&s;s again; &s;o I po&s;itively got to my carriage without being &s;een by
this curious gentleman&mdash;</P>
<P>The man at the po&s;t-hou&s;e, upon my a&s;king for &s;omething to
drink, brought me a bottle of white wine, which he told me he had made
him&s;elf, and which he would have given to no one but me; it was the very
be&s;t white I ever ta&s;ted &s;ince I drank <HI>vin d'Arbois,</HI> with which
Henry <HI>quatre</HI> u&s;ed to drink to his fair Gabrielle; but I mixed it
with water, <HI>parcequ'il faut que les Dames mettent un peu d'eau dans leur
vin&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>The man was quite offended at my of|fering to pay for it&mdash;</P>
<P>So I thanked him with one of my be&s;t &s;miles, and got into my
coach, where I had <PB N="109" REF="117"> not been above two hours before I was
fa&s;t a&s;leep, and waked only to &s;ee the walls of Florence, which do not
&s;eem calculated to defend it from any enemies, but tho&s;e which &s;muggling
might create to the Tu&s;|can &s;overeign's pur&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>I went to Meggit's inn, and got into bed about four o'clock in the
morning. I have the &s;ame apartment my mother and Lady Loui&s;a H&mdash;
occupied&mdash;when there.</P>
<P>The next day, the fir&s;t thing I did, was to go and &s;ee the Venus
de Medicis: I was &s;hewn a youthful figure oppo&s;ite as an Apollo; and after
I had examined it &s;ome time, I a&s;ked why it was called an Apollo. Does not
Eccelenza &s;ee, &s;ays the guide, his attribute the lyre? I do, returned I,
but that is modern to the &s;tatue; I made my ob&s;ervation; the man laughed.
You are perfectly right, &s;aid he, and I do not know any other rea&s;on for
its being an Apollo, than becau&s;e probably that God was thought a proper
companion for the Venus. But how did you know tho&s;e pieces were
re&s;|&s;tored? <PB N="110" REF="118"> &s;aid he; I told him from &s;ome
ob|&s;ervations I had made upon other fine works of that &s;ort&mdash;</P>
<P>However this &s;tatue is very plea&s;ing; but I do not think it has
the commanding look of the God of day. I looked at the face with delight; for
about the no&s;e and upper lip it put me in mind of my dear &s;on William, who,
probably, is now nearly as tall&mdash;</P>
<P>It is lucky for my friends that I have that &s;on and &s;ome others,
for in the humour I am in, I could almo&s;t be tempted to remain a pri&s;oner
for life, upon condition my <HI>ca|cbot</HI> was the Tribune; and I would a&s;k
for no other company than the heavenly inani|mate figures in it, their
&s;ilence is &s;o much more eloquent than language, their forms &s;o
harmonious. I think you begin not to under&s;tand me, and as I am not at all
cer|tain, if your ear and your eye agree toge|ther, as mine do, I will not
attempt to ex|plain what may be felt, but not de&s;cribed; &s;o I beg you would

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> Apropos, on looking over my let|ter, I find that I
have forgot to tell you, the only object I took notice of, from my coach going
to Florence, was the moon; it put me in mind of what Mr. de Caraccioli &s;ays;
<HI>que la lune de Naples valait bien le &s;o|leil d' Angleterre;</HI> however
our Engli&s;h &s;un has but one fault notwith&s;tanding the Mar|quis's witty
remark; and that is the &s;ame that an Engli&s;h mind has&mdash;peeping through
a cloud too often. The Venus &s;uited the ideas I had formed of her; but the
Niobe family &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them; there is a hor&s;e be|longing to that, which
is not placed in the <PB N="112" REF="120"> room with them, and which certainly

<P>THIS city is very clean and chearful; the &s;treets are paved with
large flat pieces of rock, unlike any other pavement I have &s;een, and much
&s;moother; fine &s;tatues and relievos in marble &s;tand in the &s;quares and
angles of &s;treets, without having any thing to protect them but the re&s;pect
the very lowe&s;t people have for them&mdash;Sir Horace Mann, Lord Cowper, the
Prince Cor&s;ini, the Lucca mini&s;ter Comte Santini, and the Comte d'Albany,
give great dinners here to all foreigners of di&s;tinction; but the Floren|tine
noble&s;&s;e never invite any one to dine or &s;up at their hou&s;es&mdash;When
they give an entertainment, it is an a&s;&s;embly, where every creature that
can call it&s;elf a gentle|man or gentlewoman, can ea&s;ily go&mdash;I was at
one the other night given on account of a wedding, and though it was but a few 
<PB N="114" REF="122"> paces from our Engli&s;h mini&s;ter's hou&s;e, all his

curt&s;ey to them as they pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;The number of rooms opened and
illuminated upon &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion is incredible&mdash;I was told in this
hou&s;e there were eleven rooms which were not &s;een, becau&s;e they were not
fini&s;hed&mdash;I could not help ob&s;erving that all the hand|&s;ome
Florentines are very like the Engli&s;h, an effect perhaps of the great
partiality the Italian ladies have for my country people. What I mean is, that
as they have con|&s;tantly &s;o many Engli&s;h people here, their looking at
them con&s;tantly may very natu|rally occa&s;ion the likene&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>The Italian ladies are very good-humored, which is more than I can
&s;ay for their neigh|bours the French, and they have likewi&s;e more natural
civility to &s;trangers; for they do not &s;tare at them, and whi&s;per to one
another, &s;o as to leave no doubt to the <PB N="115" REF="123">
<HI>Anglai&s;e</HI> that her dre&s;s is critici&s;ed; but they &s;peak to her,

pas a-la-mode</HI>&mdash;but they &s;uppo&s;e it is the fa&s;hion of the
country &s;he is come from&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;overeign might make Florence a paradi&s;e; but he keeps no
court&mdash;There is nothing about his manner of living that betrays either the
gaiety or magnificence that naturally belong to royalty&mdash;Any per&s;on

Duche&s;s, but I &s;hall certainly not be &s;o; for &s;ove|reigns, like the
&s;un, &s;hould chear with their rays the people who look up to them; and when
they choo&s;e to hide tho&s;e rays in a corner, &s;trangers mu&s;t be very
fooli&s;h to go and &s;eek them out, di&s;turb their privacy, and gain neither
plea&s;ure nor amu&s;ement by it. Florence &s;warms with Engli&s;h&mdash;The
operas here are very indifferent&mdash;</P>
<P>In the palaces here, there are generally &s;everal indifferent
pictures mixed with a few good ones&mdash;There are two Apo&s;tles out of four,
painted by Carlo Dolci, in the <PB N="116" REF="124"> Palazzo Riccardi, which I
think invaluable; there is a Mu&s;e by the &s;ame in the Palazzo
Cor&s;ini&mdash;</P>
<P>The Grand Duke has ju&s;t purcha&s;ed from the Dini family a picture
done by Guercino da Cento, and placed it in the Tribune; it is an Endymion
&s;leeping the &s;weetne&s;s and beauty of the countenance are enchant|ing; but
Guercino was &s;o taken up with the mortal, that he has repre&s;ented the
Godde&s;s in one corner of the &s;ky, like the paring of of a nail, however
this new pur|cha&s;e is well worthy a place in the Tribune; It co&s;t the Grand
Duke not quite an hun|dred guineas&mdash;</P>
<P>I have been obliged again to a&s;&s;ure the French, at the French
mini&s;ter's table the other day, that Sir George Elliot was not born of French
parents&mdash;</P>
<P>Sterne's adventure about Yorick, I have now good rea&s;on to believe
was a fact; for I was a&s;ked too by a Frenchman if Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds did
not build St. Paul's. <PB N="117" REF="125"> I think Frenchmen &s;hould never
quit Paris; for they do not choo&s;e to be acquainted with the chronology or
genealogies of any other nation but their own. The only thing which &s;eems to
delight the French mini&s;ter here is, that the bridge over the Arno, which is
ju&s;t before his windows, puts him in mind of the Pont-neuf at Paris; the only
ob&s;ervation I have ever heard him make upon the beauties of this
town&mdash;</P>
<P>Judge of my &s;urpri&s;e the other morning. Meggit came running in
ha&s;te to my apart|ments, to a&s;&s;ure me, that Lord B&mdash; would be here
in two or three days, he was at Venice he &s;aid, and produced a letter to
prove his a&s;&s;ertion; but as I thought I was more likely to have
intelligence than he was, and as the name was not &s;pelt right, I contented
my&s;elf with telling him to re|&s;erve, as long as he could, an apartment
adjoining to mine, then empty, and pro|mi&s;ed him I &s;hould endeavour to make
him lodge there; though my brother wrote me <PB N="118" REF="126"> word, he
&s;hould have <HI>une mai&s;on mont&eacute;e</HI> if he &s;hould pa&s;s the
winter in Italy; but I think it will be le&s;s trouble for him and me to be
here, if Florence is the place he fixes in&mdash;</P>
<P>There is a charming ride here about a mile from the town, in a wood
of the Grand Duke's, called the Ca&s;hins, (where the ladies walk or go in
phaetons, called here <HI>Bir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">hes</HI>)&mdash;but its chief-beauty, the mo&s;t enormous firs I
ever beheld, are now felling; &mdash; There is al&s;o a dairy, where cream,
milk, and butter are &s;old, at a royal price indeed. There is an excellent
invention in it to keep the milk &s;weet in this hot climate, the pans are
placed in a trough or frame, full con&s;tantly of fre&s;h water, which runs in
at one end and out at the other.&mdash;Talking of inventions too; I wonder why
in all great cities they do not copy one from the clock in the Piazza <HI>di
gran Duca</HI> here, the figures &s;hewing the hour are tran&s;parencies, with
a light behind them; &s;o that in the darke&s;t night, the &s;ober citizen can
&s;ee what hour of the night it is&mdash;</P>

becau&s;e he ended in three weeks what mo&s;t painters would have been two

attendant on &s;tudy &s;eldom can give&mdash;</P>

<P>I Received about a week &s;ince a letter from Lord B&mdash;,
informing me that he could not pa&s;s this winter in Italy; &s;o I im|mediately
determined my cour&s;e; and it is North. Now I am on the wing, I will &s;ee
courts and people that few women have &s;een, as I may never have an
opportunity of travelling again; and I will make the be&s;t u&s;e of my time;
few as the months are I can allow my&s;elf to run about in, I will employ them,
I hope, to my &s;atisfaction and your amu&s;ement&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;topped my coach to look at the flame which i&s;&s;ues
con&s;tantly from the ground <PB N="121" REF="129"> about four miles from
Fillegara: Mr. Dutens mentions it in his Itinerary. From Florence to Fillegara
the road winds round one brown mountain to another; but to-day the land&s;cape
improved much on my ap|proaching Loianc. Some &s;pots were not unworthy the
pencil of Salvator Ro&s;a.&mdash;There is a beautiful de&s;cent of a mile and a
half to Pianoro; I there got upon my hor&s;e and rode to this place; and I can
never believe it is ten miles from Pianoro here, which I am a&s;&s;ured it is.
I lodge at the Locando Reale, a large inn, the mi&s;tre&s;s of which
a&s;&s;ured me the Prince&s;s Czartori&s;ka was in Bologna; but it proves to be
the Prince&s;s Lubomir&s;ka, her &s;i&s;ter-in-law, whom I do not know; I have
only time to tell you, if you &s;hould ever pa&s;s through this city, that you
mu&s;t a&s;k to &s;ee the Palazzo Zampieri, the church of St. Giovanni in
monte, and a few others. This is a clean looking town, but I do not comprehend
the dialect; I had accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to the Tu&s;can manner of

what letters they put in <PB N="122" REF="130"> the place of tho&s;e which they

<P>I can tell you no more at pre&s;ent. I mean to get to Venice as

proceed to War&s;aw and Peter&s;burgh. I take the advantage of the winter, in

<P>I Stopped for a moment at Cento, to &s;ee the picture which is
called Guercino's <HI>chef d'oeuvre;</HI> he was born there, and is buried in
the Cathedral. From thence I proceeded to Ferrara, my road to which I advi&s;e
none to go by night; the country all about is &s;o low and flat, that the road,
to be pa&s;&s;a|ble, is rai&s;ed upon a cau&s;eway, with nothing to prevent
your hor&s;es from rolling down on one &s;ide or the other; it is extremely
narrow likewi&s;e. Ario&s;to, who was born and died at Ferrara, did not gallop
his Pega&s;us, or invoke his Mu&s;e in the clay, and among the di&s;mal poplars
to be &s;een in the &s;mall fields thereabouts; I went about three miles an
hour, I &s;lept at Ferrara, and among twenty things &s;erved up to my table at
&s;upper, I could eat nothing but celery. In <PB N="125" REF="133"> Italy
cinnamon is an ingredient they put into every di&s;h, which I have a mortal
aver|&s;ion to, woodcocks &s;tewed in &s;ugar, and chickens roa&s;ted till they
are as hard and as dry as wood&mdash;<HI>voila la cui&s;ine&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>I embarked with my coach in a very good boat at a place called
Francolino, and was rowed down the Po; I had a fine clear &s;ky, and did not
feel that I was in the month of November: From the Po I came into a canal, and
from thence into the Brenta, a pretty but narrow river; except the Sorgue, it
was the only clear &s;tream I had looked into &s;ince I had left my native
Thames; I heard much of the beautiful villas on the borders of the Brenta; but
I &s;aw none that gave me the idea of elegance or beauty on the
out&s;ide&mdash;</P>
<P>A mile before I arrived at Fu&s;ino, a vil|lage, where I was obliged
to leave my coach and &s;addle-hor&s;es, I pa&s;&s;ed a lock which &s;eparates
the &s;alt water from the fre&s;h, and there quitted the land, going five miles
acro&s;s the &s;ea, intermixed with flat &s;ands, <PB N="126" REF="134"> to get
into the great canal at Venice. I had ju&s;t read the Abb&eacute; Coyer, who
&s;ays, <HI>Rome e&s;t batie par les hommes; mais Veni&s;e par les Dieux,</HI>
and I had formed &s;ome idea of it from the pictures I had &s;een, and expected
to &s;ee a gay clean looking town, with quays on each &s;ide of the canals; but
was ex|tremely di&s;appointed; the hou&s;es are in the water, and look dirty
and uncomfortable on the out&s;ide; the fine palaces have mo&s;t of them above
half their windows &s;hut up by dirty &s;hutters not painted.</P>
<P>The innumerable quantity of gondolas too, that look like &s;wimming
coffins, added to the di&s;mal &s;cene; and, I confe&s;s, Venice on my arrival
&s;truck me rather with horror than with plea&s;ure; but now that I am
ac|cu&s;tomed to a gondola, have &s;een the in&s;ide of the <HI>Ca&s;ini,</HI>
and have tru&s;ted to my own eyes about &s;everal things, I cannot &s;ay I
di&s;like Venice in the lea&s;t. The whole &s;cene is unlike any thing I could
have ima|gined: I walk all the morning, and that is the be&s;t way of &s;eeing
the town and peo|ple. There are narrow pa&s;&s;ages that you 
<PB N="127" REF="135"> arrive at from one to another by bridges which cro&s;s
the &s;mall canals; the famed Rialto is built acro&s;s the large canal, the
arch of which is very noble and light; but there are three di&s;tinct
pa&s;&s;ages over it, formed by rows of &s;hops, the tops of which are &s;o
heavy that they disfigure this fine bridge very much; you may walk quite from
one end of Venice to the other. The extraordinary figures I &s;aw in the Piazza
San Marco would tempt one to believe, it is a <HI>bal ma&s;qu&eacute; en plein
air.</HI> We are not now in the time of the Carnaval; but I meet as many men in
black dominos and ma&s;ks as without them; the&s;e are the no|ble Venetians,
who, con&s;tantly watched by the &s;tate-&s;pies, dare not go about
un|ma&s;ked; for if an amba&s;&s;ador's &s;ervant, or a mini&s;ter, or con&s;ul
of any other nation, was &s;een &s;peaking to a noble Venetian, he might be
impri&s;oned: The laws are &s;o ex|ce&s;&s;ively &s;trict upon this &s;ubject,
that the <HI>Corps diplomatique</HI> are confined extremely in their &s;ociety,
and I am amazed any gen|tleman can accept of an emba&s;&s;y to a place where
the natives mu&s;t avoid them, as if <PB N="128" REF="136"> they were infected
with the plague.&mdash;Strangers pa&s;s their time well here; for nothing can
be more &s;ociable, civil, and magnificent, than the mini&s;ters are to one
another, and &s;trangers pre&s;ented to them&mdash;</P>
<P>The Ca&s;ini are very &s;mall hou&s;es hired by one per&s;on, or a
&s;et of people, to meet in of an evening, where cards, conver&s;ation, tea,
coffee, lemonade, &amp;c. and a well &s;e|lected &s;ociety con&s;pire to give
plea&s;ure: The&s;e Ca&s;ini are fitted up with an elegance of which you can
form no idea; I have dined in one, which has &s;o fine a view from it, that
from the neatne&s;s and ta&s;te of the in&s;ide, and of the magnificence of the
objects on the without, I could almo&s;t have fancied a little fairy's palace.
Venice &s;eems to me to be a new world, retired and different from any other I
have &s;een; the Venetian ladies are &s;ome of them very hand&s;ome, and a few
of them are mo&s;t re|markably determined in their re&s;olutions. It is not an
uncommon thing here for a lady, married in the morning, to declare to her
parents before night that &s;he has taken <PB N="129" REF="137"> an aver&s;ion
to her hu&s;band, who, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, is forced with the parents to
apply to the great ma&s;ter of the church (the Pope) who is always good enough
to admit of the rea&s;ons given him, as &s;uffi|cient to grant a divorce; the
lady, once out of her convent, bears the name of her own family in the world,
and the gentle|man looks out for another wife&mdash;</P>
<P>Nothing is more frequent here than to &s;ee a Venetian lady quit her
palace, for months together, to live in a ca&s;ino; of which the hu&s;band
perhaps does not even know the &s;ituation; I could divert you ex|tremely with
&s;ome Venetian anecdotes, but I have no lei&s;ure to make this letter much
longer; for between my Venetian acquaintance and the amba&s;&s;adors I have
&s;carcely time to breathe. The Comte Ju&s;tiniani was delighted to &s;ee me
again; he has promi&s;ed to accompany me to the Ar&s;enal, which is extremely
large, and where the man, who &s;hewed it to me, was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, the
State was building frigates of a hundred guns each, and twenty 
<PB N="130" REF="138"> &s;uch lies. The ancient families of Venice are the
mo&s;t pure noble&s;&s;e in Italy, and that idea, together with their natural
&s;pirit and extraordinary &s;ituation, will produce many brave and gallant
&s;oldiers among them, whenever a good cau&s;e calls them into the
field&mdash;</P>

<P>I Have been to &s;ee the Doge's palace, and the church in the Piazza
San Marco, both Gothic, and what is very &s;hocking to the eye, the fine bronze
hor&s;es brought from Con&s;tantinople are perched over the door of the church.
Books will inform you more minutely than I can of the pictures to be &s;een in
Venice. The council chamber is a very fine room; but all the paintings in it
are dirty; I went likewi&s;e into the court of ju&s;tice, becau&s;e every body
was running to hear l'Avocato Stephano; and I thought from the grimaces and

<PB N="132" REF="140"> two thumbs which he had &s;tuck upright, and moved very
quickly from and near his brea&s;t, was perhaps the mo&s;t ridiculous ac|tion
that ever was imagined, nor can I con|ceive how any per&s;ons, much le&s;s the
judges, could keep their countenances.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for you to imagine any thing more entertaining
than the Piazza San Marco: people of every nation, and in dre&s;&s;es I never
&s;aw, and indeed never can &s;ee but at Venice, are lounging in the &s;hops
and coffee-hou&s;es; and it is a great amu&s;e|ment to me as I walk there every
morning. But I never &s;tay long, for they read Engli&s;h in my looks; and
their love for any thing of that nation is &s;o great, that they will come from
the other end of the Piazza to look at an Engli&s;h woman&mdash;</P>
<P>There are two fine lions at the door of the Ar&s;enal, in marble,
brought from the entrance of the Piraean port: it is a pity I cannot make them

<P><PB N="133" REF="141"> The hou&s;e I lodge in is mi&s;erably cold,
it is upon the grand canal&mdash;and as the gla|ziers here &s;eldom put putty

perfectly well with me &mdash; Provi&s;ions are very good here; every lady
&s;eems determined to be amu&s;ed and chear|ful, and I think I could pa&s;s a
very merry winter here; there are &s;everal theatres, and I have been to an
opera&mdash;very good. The Ru&s;&s;ian mini&s;ter's wife is Madame de &mdash;'s

from Vienna is likewi&s;e extremely &s;en|&s;ible and polite, and her hu&s;band
the be&s;t man in the world; and I mu&s;t not forget, for the honour of our

ab&s;olutely love &s;o much, that it will be a grief to me to part with her.

<OPENER><DATELINE>VIENNA, 
<DATE>Dec. 14, 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Came, as I told you I was advi&s;ed, by a new road; but I &s;hould
imagine from the difficulties I met with it was the wor&s;t. It is true, &s;ome
of them were owing to rivers, which, &s;welled by the late rains, are be|come
torrents which have carried whole vil|lages and many miles of the road before
them&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;et out from Venice on the 30th of la&s;t month, going by water
to Me&s;tre, where my coach and hor&s;es met me. I meant that night to have
&s;lept at Mr. &mdash;, at Cor|negliano; but the weather was &s;o bad that I
was obliged to &s;tay at a village called Tre|vi&s;a, where there is an
excellent and clean inn. The next day, I endeavoured to cro&s;s the river, but
the boatmen would not ven|ture <PB N="137" REF="145"> over, though I had my
coach embark|ed, and would have gone my&s;elf, knowing I was expected by Mr.
&mdash;, &s;o I was obliged to return to the good inn&mdash;where I was
&s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee, what I thought a fine large chicken &s;erved up to my
table, which upon cutting, I found to have brown fle&s;h; I a&s;ked what it
was, and was an&s;wered&mdash;<HI>una Colombina</HI>&mdash;it was a pigeon. I
begged to &s;ee one alive, or at lea&s;t with the feathers on, for it mu&s;t
have been a mo&s;t extraordi|nary &s;ight; but the people &s;eemed more
a&s;toni&s;hed at my admiration of this bird than I was at the &s;ize of it;
for it is the com|mon pigeon there&mdash;</P>
<P>The next day, the rain and wind being &s;omewhat abated, I got to
Cornegliano, and you may imagine the real plea&s;ure I was re|ceived with by a
countryman, who had not &s;een me for many years, and that in my own hou&s;e in
the country. I never was more delighted in my life than by the mu&s;ic I heard
there; his elde&s;t daughter, a child about &s;even years old, plays on the
harp&s;i|chord with a ta&s;te and feeling at which few <PB N="138" REF="146">
people, more advanced in age and mu&s;ic, ever arrive. Her &s;i&s;ter too, an
infant of five years of age, played and &s;ung her part afterwards wonderfully
for her years&mdash;</P>
<P>In the evening many of the Venetian no|ble&s;&s;e came to partake of
the concert, and &s;ee the Donna Ingle&s;e; among Mr. &mdash;'s country
neighbours there were &s;everal who were as fat, fair, and heavy as many of our
Engli&s;h Country 'Squires, and, like them, had never &s;tirred from their
family man&s;ion; and I fancy the Engli&s;h lady and her hor&s;es, will be the
&s;ubject of their fire-&s;ide conver|&s;ation for &s;ome time&mdash;</P>
<P>The next day I pa&s;&s;ed the Taillamanta, a river which had torn
and wa&s;hed away the road for nine miles before I came to it; &s;o I travelled
in a bed of gravel, every now and then jumping into and out of a little ditch
formed by the different torrents. The river was frightful to pa&s;s. I got to
San Daniello, from which place, this new road is called the San Daniello road;
from thence <PB N="139" REF="147"> to Pontiebba, the road is good; but winds
round rocks according to the turns of a ri|ver, which was &s;ometimes on the
right, &s;ometimes on the left, in a mo&s;t beautiful manner. It is &s;o
narrow, that I think it the mo&s;t dangerous I ever went, nothing between the
precipice and the carriage to prevent an accident. It would be well worth any
per&s;on's while, who is as fond of the beauties of nature as I am, to ride
along this road. The views are romantic and maje&s;tic beyond
de&s;cription&mdash;</P>
<P>Trevi&s;a, which is the place I next &s;lept at, I arrived at with
much difficulty; my coach drawn with ten hor&s;es and four oxen; and you can
form to your&s;elf no idea of the ob&s;tinacy, and provoking phlegm of a
Ger|man po&s;tillion or po&s;tma&s;ter. At one place, tired of the &s;nail-like
pace I went, I hired a traineau of a pea&s;ant, and went on before my carriage.
It &s;eems there is an order at every frontier town in Germany, not to &s;uffer
&s;trangers who travel without po&s;t|hor&s;es, to leave the town without
&s;taying in it two hours; this the German po&s;t-ma&s;|ter 
<PB N="140" REF="148"> did not choo&s;e to tell me, nor did he re|fu&s;e me
another traineau and hor&s;es, but &s;at with two other fat Germans playing at
cards, without deigning to give me any other an|&s;wer
than&mdash;<HI>Patienza,</HI> to any thing I could &s;ay to him. When I
recollect the &s;cene of the&s;e three fat men playing at cards, their figures,
and all I &s;aid in Italian to per&s;uade the man and his <HI>patienza</HI> I
could die with laughing; however, in about an hour, an officer came in, who
looking at me &s;ome time, &s;aid, <HI>Parles vous Francais?&mdash;Mon Dieu,
oui Mon&s;ieur,</HI> &s;ays I; and I found, the po&s;t-ma&s;ter's deafne&s;s
proceeded from his not being able to talk Italian very well, French not at all;
&s;o he took me for an im|patient boy, and &s;ent me to Coventry. When the
gentleman called me <HI>Miladi,</HI> the&s;e three fat Germans deigned to look
at me; for I mu&s;t tell you that in this coun|try, the re&s;pect paid to our
&s;ex is &s;uch, that it is enough for a woman to &s;peak, &s;he is obeyed
immediately; and I had a traineau, and &s;ix hor&s;es for my coach ready in an
in|&s;tant. One night I &s;lept at Klagenfurt, a large town, where one of the
Emperor's <PB N="141" REF="149"> unmarried &s;i&s;ters lives. I am arrived here
at la&s;t, through a very beautiful country; but mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that whoever
wrote L. M&mdash;'s Letters (for &s;he never wrote a line of them)
mi&s;repre&s;ents things mo&s;t terribly; I do really believe, in mo&s;t things
they wi&s;hed to impo&s;e upon the credulity of their readers, and laugh at
them. The &s;toves of this country, which &s;he prai&s;es &s;o much, are the
mo&s;t horrid invention you can conceive. The country people in Ger|many &s;eem
to fear the cold very much; the ca&s;ements of their windows are double; and
there being no chimney in the rooms, there is no vent for fumes of any &s;ort,
&s;o that the breath of the inhabitants of them re&s;ts in drops of &s;team on
all the tables, &amp;c. and the &s;tink and &s;uffocating heat that
a&s;|&s;ails the traveller's &s;en&s;es when he enters any room, particularly
where people are, cannot be conceived. I do not believe the German women, of
the lower order, are very gentle tempers; for &s;everal of them flew into the
mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ions, when I opened a door or window, and &s;hut them
again immediately. My only re&s;ource upon <PB N="142" REF="150"> the&s;e
occa&s;ions was to go out into the yard&mdash;</P>
<P>As to the &s;toves being ornamental; I think they are frightful from
the compo&s;iti|on of them, the ground work of which mu&s;t be iron to
re&s;i&s;t the fire within; the glaz|ing, painting, and varni&s;h &s;oon
moulder off; and I leave you to judge, from this in|evitable circum&s;tance,
together with ano|ther, which is the &s;ize of them, how it is po&s;&s;ible
they can repre&s;ent either China jars or any other thing that may be elegant
or pretty, as a &s;tove fills up one corner of the room&mdash;</P>
<P>In this town, &s;everal of the fir&s;t hou&s;es have fine
comfortable chimnies, and &s;toves are, where they &s;hould be&mdash;in the
anti|chamber. The difference of the chearful|ne&s;s which a good fire gives to
a room, to that which reigns in one where there is only a &s;tove, is very
vi&s;ible. I think things mu&s;t be very much altered &s;ince that lady or
gentleman wrote about Vienna. The German ladies are hand&s;ome, accompli&s;hed,
<PB N="143" REF="151"> and civil to a degree you have no idea of; &s;everal of
them, be&s;ides po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing many other languages, read, write, and
&s;peak Engli&s;h well; and I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find my connections, and
other circum&s;tances flattering to my pride, better known here than they are
by half my acquaintances in London&mdash;</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Germans are naturally mu&s;i|cians, and I am &s;ure a
young Engli&s;hman, with good manners, may every evening here pa&s;s his hours
in a circle of hand&s;ome and accompli&s;hed women of the fir&s;t rank. I have
&s;een no place yet I &s;hould &s;o much wi&s;h my &s;on to come to as Vienna.
Sir Robert Keith a&s;&s;ures me he has pre&s;ented above four hundred noblemen
and gentle|men, young countrymen of mine, and has never had rea&s;on to
complain of them, while we hear and &s;ee con&s;tantly the follies of the

<HI>Duche&s;&s;e</HI> or the <HI>fille d'opera,</HI> and only to be laughed at
&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="152"> The ladies are tall and fair&mdash;more
hand|&s;ome than pretty. There is a great &s;upper at Prince Galitzin's every
Sunday night; and at Prince Par's every Monday; the fir&s;t is the Ru&s;&s;ian

<DATE>Dec. 15, 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Went with Madame Granieri, the Sar|dinian Mini&s;ter's wife, to
court. Nothing is more &s;triking, I think, than the variety of the officers
dre&s;&s;es in the Emperor's anti-chamber. The Hungarian and Poli&s;h I think
beautiful, and I now am &s;trengthen|ed in the opinion I always had, though
pro|bably I have never told it, even to you, that every nation ought to
pre&s;erve the fa&s;hion of their country, and that there is no nece&s;&s;ity
for mankind to ape one ano|ther in dre&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>The Emperor gives a private audi|ence for ladies that are
pre&s;ented to him. There was only my&s;elf and the lady who accompanied me
that went into his room together; we met a Prince&s;s E&s;ter|hazi coming out.
The Emperor was clo&s;e <PB N="147" REF="155"> to the door; and after bowing
very civilly, he made us &s;it upon a &s;ofa, and &s;tood the whole time
him&s;elf; I &s;taid three quarters of an hour; there is no occa&s;ion to fear
&s;taying too long; for when he cannot &s;pare any more for the audience, or
for any other rea&s;on choo&s;es to end it, he very ci|villy &s;ays, he will
detain you no longer; you then get up, and go to the door, which he opens
him&s;elf, and thus ends the pre&s;en|tation, I think much more agreeably than
to an&s;wer any que&s;tions a Sovereign choo&s;es to make before a hundred
people that are within hearing in the circle of a drawing-room, who generally
repeat what they hear, according to the folly or malice they po&s;|&s;e&s;s;
and I &s;hould think it totally impo&s;&s;ible for a monarch to conver&s;e with
any &s;atisfac|tion &s;urrounded by &s;o many ears, which have often no brains
belonging to them. The Emperor is like the Queen of France, and the only thing
that <HI>gen&eacute;d</HI> me at was his not being &s;eated. He conver&s;es
politely and agreeably&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="156"> The fir&s;t mini&s;ter here, Prince
Kaunitz&mdash;is a very extraordinary per&s;onage; he is reckoned an able

con&s;tant attendants on a mind truly great&mdash;and I believe the we fare of
the people at large is his delight; for he a&s;ked me what I thought of Vienna;
I told him that I had not time to make many ob&s;ervations, but that there was
an air of plenty and comfort among the lower &s;ort of people very &s;triking;
<HI>meme les vendeu&s;es de pommes out l'air ai&s;e, mon Prince;</HI> on my
&s;aying this, there was a &s;mile upon his coun|tenance, which I am &s;ure
came from his heart; and he conde&s;cendingly told me &s;e|veral particulars
relative to the markets and provi&s;ions, one of which I cannot help thinking
very nece&s;&s;ary in all large cities, which is, that there is an in&s;pector
for the garden-&s;tuff&mdash;another for meat&mdash;and &s;o on, for all
provi&s;ions expo&s;ed to &s;ale; and if they are not found perfectly good they
are fiung away. And now we are upon the &s;ubject of provi&s;ions, I mu&s;t
&s;ay, that I never &s;aw &s;uch a profu&s;ion of things, and 
<PB N="149" REF="157"> tho&s;e &s;o excellent in their kind, as are &s;erved up
at the tables here. Green peas, artichokes, and a&s;paragus, I eat every day.
The crawfi&s;h are as large as the Chiche&s;ter lob&s;ters; and the phea&s;ants
from Bohemia have a flavour you can form no idea of. Yet I do not think the
people are <HI>gourmands;</HI> but they pique them&s;elves on having the
greate&s;t abundance and the be&s;t &s;ort of eat|ables of every kind. The
fore&s;ts and rivers of this country do not in a &s;mall degree contribute to
the po&s;&s;ibility of the&s;e things; for with us, our cooks cannot produce
wild boar and veni&s;on, <HI>gelinottes,</HI> and <HI>coqs de bruyeres;</HI> or
crawfi&s;h as big as lob&s;ters&mdash;</P>
<P>There is one thing here that &s;hocks me and that is, that every
lower cla&s;s of wo|men paint white; and even girls of ten years old going of
errands in the &s;treet are painted. What their rea&s;on for &s;o doing is I
cannot gue&s;s; for the Germans are gene|rally fair. I dine very often with
Prince Kaunitz; and as I am naturally as &s;incere as he is, our
conver&s;ations do not grow languid. There is nothing that ever did 
<PB N="150" REF="158"> really flatter me &s;o much, as when people of his age

<P>There are great a&s;&s;emblies here as in London; and I repeat it,
there are women here with whom I could pa&s;s my life. They have not the cold

<P>I Got away as fa&s;t as I po&s;&s;ibly could from Vienna; for if I
had &s;taid a week longer, I am convinced I &s;hould have &s;taid the whole
winter. The country between Vienna and Cracow is very fine; chiefly open, here
and there the plain beautifully varied with hills of gentle a&s;cent, and
&s;mall woods; the &s;port&s;man and the painter would be plea&s;ed with it, as
it affords a variety of land&s;capes and game, equally favourable to both. The
firs and deciduous trees do not &s;eem to flouri&s;h in the &s;ame &s;pot; I
frequently &s;aw a wood of the one to my right, and of the other to my left; I
ob&s;erved, that cattle of all &s;orts are &s;uffered to eat the green corn
during the hard weather&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="162"> The herd&s;man with his cows, and the

when very young, pointed out by Mr. Brown, who certainly never learnt their
value in the gardens of my an|ce&s;tors&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;lept the fir&s;t night at Nicol&s;bourg, a &s;mall town, &s;ix
po&s;ts, or &s;ixty miles from the capital; the next at Brun, a neat for|tified
town, commanded by a fort, and &s;teep hill we&s;t of the city, that is watered
by a branch of the river Thaja, which &s;tream, a few miles lower, mixes with
the river Ma&s;h, at a &s;hort di&s;tance we&s;t of Pre&s;|burgh, and by
uniting afterwards with the Danube, adds con&s;iderably to the rapidity of that
river.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the villages are &s;ituated under the &s;helter of hills;
the hou&s;es are chiefly built of logs of the fir-trees, laid horizon|tally
upon one another, the inter&s;tices filled <PB N="155" REF="163"> up with
mo&s;s or clay. The road from Brun to Olmutz is bordered with large old
cherry-trees. After quitting Olmutz, I pa&s;&s;ed a large convent on the plain

of all others the &s;ure&s;t &s;ource of confu&s;ion that ever yet was imagined
by mankind; an elected King from the noble families, mo&s;t of which think they
have a right to royalty, and &s;everal really are en|titled to it &mdash;</P>
<P>I think, Sir, had I been born a Poli&s;h nobleman, rather than have
&s;een my exten|&s;ive country divided between ambitious neighbours, I would
have called my coun|trymen together, propo&s;ed to have relin|qui&s;hed (for us
and for our heirs for ever) that unfortunate privilege; have invited &s;ome
&s;pirited prince from Germa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> in 
<PB N="157" REF="165"> whom hereditary courage and all the virtues belonging to
a good &s;oldier were blended, and made him and his de&s;cendants the law|ful
Sovereigns of this kingdom&mdash;</P>
<P>Dirty &s;uburbs filled with Jews; and the Emperor's eagle, are the
only objects that precede the gates of Cracow; the&s;e gates are pierced by
many a ball, and probably, if each bore the name of his &s;ender, the gateway
might be divided into as many pieces for tho&s;e who have claims to it, as
Poland her&s;elf is divided into parties; I had letters for &s;everal Poli&s;h
ladies at Cracow, but I &s;taid only to re&s;t my&s;elf, and get a traineau
made; for I was told I might go thus, but a couple of miles from the town I was
obliged to take my coach off the &s;ledge; and here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, Sir,
that the Prince Galitzin at Vienna, was very much mi&s;taken, when he told me,
he &s;hould advi&s;e me to have ju&s;t &s;uch a coach as mine made if I were
not already mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;uch a one&mdash;</P>
<P>I hung more than once upon fir-trees; the track of the road being
too narrow for <PB N="153" REF="166"> my wide carriage; and when travellers
come into Germany, I think they ought to part with their French and Engli&s;h
carriages, as the carriages of our northern countries are liable to
inconveniencies and accidents&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;taid two hours one night, &s;o fa&s;tened with the hind-wheel
upon a fir-tree, that &s;ix men could not &s;tir it, and pea&s;ants were called
to cut down the tree, before I could proceed&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hall refer you to Mr. Coxe's book for the accommodations I met
with on the road, and confine my de&s;criptions to agreeable
circum&s;tances&mdash;</P>
<P>When I arrived at War&s;aw, I found my apartments had been warmed
and ready two days before my arrival; the Comte de Stackelberg having be&s;poke
them, by the de&s;ire of Prince Galitzin, and the Ru&s;&s;ian Mini&s;ter
C&mdash; de S&mdash; waited on me. The King received us in his &s;tudy; I was
accompanied by the Grand Marechal's <PB N="159" REF="167"> wife, who is one of
the King's nieces&mdash;You, Sir, do not &s;peak better French and Eng|li&s;h
than that amiable Sovereign; he told me he had been in England thirty years
pa&s;t, and a&s;ked me if Mr. W&mdash; was &s;till living? not only living I
replied, Sir; but in good &s;pirits; for I have a charming letter in my pocket
from him&mdash;He &s;aid, if there was nothing imprudent in his reque&s;t, he
would a&s;k to &s;ee it. He imagined Mr. W's &s;tile mu&s;t be uncommon; I gave
him the letter, he put it into his pocket after reading it, and told me, as his
&s;i&s;ter, the Prince&s;s of Cracovia did not under&s;tand Engli&s;h, he
&s;hould tran&s;late it into French for her; and if I would dine with him two
days after, he would read me his tran&s;lati|on, which indeed &s;urprized me;
he mu&s;t be a very elegant writer in every language he choo&s;es to profe&s;s;
I wi&s;h I had dared to have a&s;ked him for a copy. Well, Sir, he is the
&s;econd per&s;on I have &s;een, whom I wi&s;hed were not &s;overeigns, for it
is impo&s;|&s;ible that the many di&s;agreeable per&s;ons and circum&s;tances,
that &s;urround them, &s;hould <PB N="160" REF="168"> not deprive them of the
&s;ociety of people who, &s;acrificing only to the Mu&s;es, are better company
than tho&s;e who only &s;acri|fice to ambition, when they give their time to
&s;overeigns. We were only fourteen people at the King's dinner, and we
con|ver&s;ed as chearfully and as rationally as if we had not been at
court&mdash;</P>
<P>The King, in his face, is very like the Duke of Marlborough, and
there is an ele|gance in his language, with a &s;oftne&s;s in the tone of his
voice, that plea&s;es the ear to the highe&s;t degree. My old acquaintance, the
prince&s;s C&mdash;, will be the occa&s;ion of my &s;hortening my &s;tay here;
for it is many years &s;ince I &s;aw her, and as &s;he does not come here on
account &mdash; I &s;hall give her the meeting in the country, and afterwards
&s;et out for Peter&s;burgh. I told the King I &s;hould &s;ee her, as he
&s;poke to me of her: I hate party affairs&mdash;and &mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="169"> I make vi&s;its in a new &s;tile here, in the
Comte de Stackelberg's coach and &s;ix, and a couple of equerries at the two
coach win|dows on hor&s;eback. The Poli&s;h ladies &s;eem to have much ta&s;te,
magnificence, &s;pirit and gaiety; they are polite and lively, ex|ce&s;&s;ively
accompli&s;hed, partial to the Eng|li&s;h. There is a Prince&s;s de Radzivil,
who, if I were a man, I &s;hould certainly be de|voted to&mdash;I could be very
happy here, Sir, if my heart could forget maternal duties, or tho&s;e of
friend&s;hip &mdash;</P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;everal dwarfs here, who with equerries &s;tand in
drawing-rooms of the great hou&s;es, and hear all the conver|&s;ation that
pa&s;&s;es, an uncomfortable cu&s;tom I think; and which in any other country
would be dangerous; but here &s;ervants and dependants are the ab&s;olute
property of the ma&s;ter&mdash;and their fidelity in general is equal to their
&s;ubjection; to the credit of the Poli&s;h nobles, I believe there are few
&s;er|vants that, having proved for eight or ten <PB N="162" REF="170"> years
their attachment, are not di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a pen&s;ion for life. I found
the French maid, the Prince&s;s C&mdash; had from me, in this &s;ituation; nine
years &s;ervice had ob|tained a hundred pounds a year, and a farm of &s;ixty
acres of land for the re&s;t of her life; &s;he &s;eems the happie&s;t creature
in the world. The King has a manner of &s;aying things obliging or flattering,
pecu|liar to him&s;elf; he tells me he thinks men, animals, trees, every thing
in &s;hort, that takes its birth or is produced by England, is more perfect
than the produce of other countries; the climate, the &s;oil probably, he
&s;ays, may occa&s;ion this; his partiality to the Engli&s;h, together with
your's, Sir, would make me prejudiced in favour of my own country, if I could
love it better than I do; but the word comfort which is under|&s;tood there
only, has long &s;tamped the value of it in my mind&mdash;</P>
<P>I am going to &s;ee the Prince&s;s to-mor|row, and am &s;orry to
quit this place &s;o &s;oon; not that there is any thing in this flat 
<PB N="163" REF="171"> country that would tempt me to &s;ee the beauties of it
in the &s;pring, but the King's acquaintance, with that of &s;ome of the

<P>THE road between War&s;aw and this place is one in&s;ipid flat,
except ju&s;t in and about the town of Nerva, where I took a &s;ledge and flew
hither. When I wrote la&s;t, dear Sir, I think I was upon the point of going to
&s;ee the Prince&s;s C&mdash;, I pa&s;&s;ed two days with her at a country
hou&s;e of the Prince&s;s Lubomir&s;ka's, her &s;i&s;ter-in-law; I was mo&s;t
&s;incerely glad to &s;ee her, and we parted with regret. I received a very
civil me&s;&s;age from the King, and M. de Stackel|berg &s;ent me &s;ix bottles
of bi&s;hop, which I can a&s;&s;ure you was very &s;erviceable to me; I did not
&s;top at War&s;aw on my re|turn from the P&mdash;, and the me&s;&s;enger
caught me ju&s;t one po&s;t on this &s;ide of War&s;aw; I can conceive nothing
&s;o <HI>enuyant</HI> as travelling in &s;uch a country as this, one 
<PB N="165" REF="173"> flat plain; the view terminated by a fore&s;t, which you
drive through, only to arrive at the &s;ame &s;cene you have quitted, the
fro&s;t was not hard enough to make the road good, till I came to Nerva. I am
&s;omething like a country Mi&s;s, gaping at the window all day here, every
creature that goes about the &s;treets, &s;eem as if they were in a violent
hurry, they drize full gallop, traineaus with one hor&s;e ply at the corners of
the &s;treets as do your hackney-coaches and chairs. Mr. S&mdash; informed me,
it belonged to my dignity to have &s;ix hor&s;es to my coach, in order to pay
my vi&s;its; and I beg you will imagine my &s;urpri&s;e, when I found I had a
coachman on the box, with three po&s;til|lions, one to each pair of hor&s;es;
and the&s;e &s;itting on the right hand, I go thus, full gallop, running races
with every other <HI>attelage</HI> that falls in my way; the &s;treets are
luckily wide, and cu&s;tom makes the danger le&s;s than one &s;hould

<P>I Was to have been pre&s;ented to the Em|pre&s;s next Sunday, but
&s;he graciou&s;ly &s;ent me word to come to the Hermitage on Thur&s;day, where
&s;he keeps her court in the evening every week; and has alternate|ly a French
play or an Italian opera&mdash;Marche&s;ini and Madame Todi are the fir&s;t
&s;ingers. It is but ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that no|thing can be more magnificent
than the appearance the Empre&s;s makes when &s;he comes into the drawing-room;
&s;he has a lively and good-humoured look, and her politene&s;s to me was very
great; but I could plainly &s;ee that &s;ome one had told her I was not an
Engli&s;h woman, for &s;he a&s;ked me if I was not of a Scotch family. I
can|not conceive why this building which &s;he has added to the palace is
called the Hermi|tage; <PB N="167" REF="175"> it is a long &s;uite of rooms,
full of fine pictures. You are not ignorant, dear Sir, of the many collections
the Empre&s;s has purcha&s;ed; among the re&s;t Lord Orford's; all the&s;e fine
works want at pre&s;ent, a per|&s;on to arrange them according to their
&s;hades and &s;ize, and I doubt not but the Empre&s;s will find one&mdash;</P>
<P>Peter&s;burgh is a chearful and fine looking town; the &s;treets are
extremely wide and long, the hou&s;es &s;tucco'd to imitate white &s;tone; none
above three &s;tories high, which certainly adds to the lively and airy
appear|ance of them; I think, Sir, if a young woman may permit her&s;elf to
judge of things otherwi&s;e than <HI>en detail</HI>&mdash;that not only the
town, but the manner of living is upon too large a a &s;cale; the nobles &s;eem
to vie with one another in extravagancies of every &s;ort, particularly in
foreign luxuries and fa&s;hion. The fa&s;hion of the day is mo&s;t ridiculous
and improper for this cli|mate; French gauzes and flowers were not intended for
Ru&s;&s;ian beauties, and they are &s;old at a price here which mu&s;t ruin the
buyers.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="176"> There are buildings erected for the
re|ception of Arts and Sciences of every kind; for arti&s;ts or amateurs,
though but the &s;ur|plus of Italy, France, and England, would find hand&s;ome
encouragement and hou&s;e|room from the Empre&s;s, who&s;e re&s;pect for
talents, and genero&s;ity to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them, have induced
&s;ome, and would many more, to fix in the pre&s;ent capital of this va&s;t
empire; but, alas! Sir, eight months of winter, and the horrid cold I feel,
mu&s;t congeal the warme&s;t imagination; poets and painters require verdant
lawns; and the flowers of fancy mu&s;t fade and die, where &s;pring is not to
be found&mdash;</P>
<P>The Empre&s;s and the Prince&s;s d'A&s;hkow are the only ladies who
wear the Ru&s;&s;ian dre&s;s; it is I think a very hand&s;ome one; and I am
more &s;urpri&s;ed every day, that nations do not each pre&s;erve their own
fa&s;hions, and not copy one country that is at pre&s;ent only the ape of every
other&mdash;From Cher&s;on, the new town on the Tur|ki&s;h frontiers, which is
one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred miles from hence, are brought 
<PB N="169" REF="177"> many provi&s;ions; from Archangel likewi&s;e this town
is provided, and from A&s;tracan on the Ca&s;pian Sea, near two thou&s;and
miles, all the dainties, &s;uch as grapes, pea&s;e, beans, artichokes, are
brought. It is na|tural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the nece&s;&s;aries of life are
dear, from the&s;e circum&s;tances; but &s;ome of them are extremely cheap, and
I believe Ru&s;&s;ia is one of the cheape&s;t coun|tries in the world to live
in; if French wines and fa&s;hions, and Engli&s;h comforts can be di&s;pen&s;ed
with. To the&s;e la&s;t I never felt &s;o much attachment as at this
moment&mdash;<HI>Dans le Ligne Anglais,</HI> a quarter of this town, where the
Engli&s;h merchants live, I find Engli&s;h grates, Engli&s;h coals, and
Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality, to make me wel|come, and the fire-&s;ide chearful; I
have never yet been fortunate enough to make any acquaintance in the world of
com|merce; but if all Engli&s;h merchants and their families are as well
informed and civil as tho&s;e I find here; I &s;hould be very glad to be
admitted into the city of London as a vi&s;itor, to enjoy a little rational
conver&s;a|tion, which at the court-end is &s;eldom to <PB N="170" REF="178">
be found. How &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e? A little Latin and Greek in the
&s;chools of We&s;tmini&s;ter and Eton, and a great deal of vulgar rioting,
make our young men a &s;trange mixture of pedanti&s;m and vice, which can only
produce impudence and folly. Thus tutored, at &s;ixteen they are turned upon
the hands of &s;ome unhappy man, who is to pre&s;ent them at foreign courts,
with no other improvement or alte|ration in the boys heads, than that of their
hair being powdered and tied behind&mdash;</P>
<P>The careful citizen, con&s;cious that fair dealing and knowledge
only can promote the well-being of his family, brings up his &s;on to
bu&s;ine&s;s, and that only, as you know well, makes the idle moments of life
happy. Peter the Fir&s;t thought commerce an e&s;&s;en|tial pillar to his
empire, and the Engli&s;h trader was encouraged; our little i&s;land is a proof
of the con&s;equence which trade alone can give any country; and the new
ac|quired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the large&s;t empires may only become
additional trouble to their ma&s;ters, unle&s;s the advantages of trade give
them new life&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="179"> The French Amba&s;&s;ador, and the Comte
Serg&eacute; de Romanzow (named to Berlin) are men of wit. Mr. Ellis is with
Mr. Fitzher|bert; and conver&s;ation does not langui&s;h or grow in&s;ipid in
their company. We are in the la&s;t part of the carnival and balls; tho&s;e
given by the Amba&s;&s;adors are very &s;uperb. Mr. de Segur, and the Duc de
Serra Capriola, the Neapolitan Mini&s;ter, have each given one in a very
magnificent &s;tyle&mdash;</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ented to the Grand Duche&s;s the &s;ame night that I
waited upon the Em|pre&s;s; &s;he has &s;ince been brought to bed. There are
&s;ome young Ru&s;&s;ian ladies very pretty and much accompli&s;hed; many of
them &s;igh after a different climate from their own, and &mdash; told me he
had no idea of happine&s;s in the world like that of re|turning to England as a
private man, and purcha&s;ing a farm; he &s;peaks very good Engli&s;h. Indeed,
Sir, the elegance which is produced by the cleanline&s;s and order &s;een with
us, is found no where out of England; here the hou&s;es are decorated 
<PB N="172" REF="180"> with the mo&s;t &s;umptuous furniture from every
country; but you come into a draw|ing-room, where the floor is of the fine&s;t
inlaid woods, through a &s;tairca&s;e made of the coar&s;e&s;t wood in the
rude&s;t man|ner, and &s;tinking dirt&mdash;The po&s;tillions wear
&s;heep-&s;kins; and at a ball, when a nobleman has propo&s;ed his hand to a
fair lady, he often ki&s;&s;es her before the whole company&mdash;<HI>&agrave;

<P>Adieu, Sir&mdash;I will give you &s;ome ac|count in my next of what
I have &s;een at the Mu&s;eum&mdash;</P>
<P>You may have heard much of Prince Potemkin; I &s;ee him every where,
but he is re&s;erved and conver&s;es very little with ladies. I was invited by
him to dine in an <PB N="173" REF="181"> immen&s;e palace he is building in the
&s;ub|urbs; the only room fini&s;hed is too particu|lar not to be de&s;cribed;
it is three hundred feet in length, and on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite the windows
there are two rows of &s;tone pillars, who&s;e height and breadth are
proportioned to the immen&s;e &s;ize of the room, which is an oblong &s;quare;
in the centre of which on the &s;ide where the windows are, it is formed into a
&s;emi-circle or what we call a bow&mdash;which bow forms another large &s;pace
independent of, though in the room; this &s;pace was laid out by his Engli&s;h
gardener into a &s;hrubbery, with borders of flowers, hyacinths, and
narci&s;&s;u&s;es&mdash;myrtles, orange-trees, &amp;c. &amp;c. were in plenty.
We were &s;even or eight ladies, and as many men&mdash;immen&s;e &s;toves
concealed by the pillars, were heated in order to make &s;uch a hall in &s;uch
a climate &s;upportable&mdash;but I came home quite ill with cold. It was there
I heard that extraordinary mu&s;ic performed by men and boys, each blowing a
&s;traight horn adapted to their &s;ize&mdash;&s;ixty-five of the&s;e
mu&s;icians produce a very harmonious melody, &s;omething like an immen&s;e
organ. <PB N="174" REF="182"> The mu&s;ic, the room, the cold, all was
gi|gantic I &s;at by Prince Potemkin at din|ner; but except a&s;king me to eat

transferred his capital to this place, and that the Empre&s;s, Prince Potemkin,

contain the produce of learning and commerce, that a time will

<P>I forgot to tell you. Sir, that the Grand Duche&s;s was brought to
bed five days after my arrival; &s;o I have only &s;een her the night I was
pre&s;ented to her, which was the &s;ame on which I was pre&s;ented to the
Empre&s;s; her affability is great to &s;trangers; for Mr. S&mdash; had not
announced me to her; but &s;eeing me move from one &s;eat to another at the
opera, by the Empre&s;s's de&s;ire, and probably being informed who I was,
&s;he &s;ent for me to come to her after the &s;pecta|cle&mdash;which I did. A
mo&s;t ridiculous thing happened to me; for though I had no le&s;s than three
carriages as I thought waiting for <PB N="180" REF="188"> me, I was above an
hour getting at one, owing to the great di&s;tance of the Grand Duche&s;s's
apartments from the Hermitage, where the theatre is&mdash;and Mr. S&mdash;'s
telling me he waited for me at the Hermi|tage. I went three times through the
whole palace, and while I was at one door, two of the carriages were at the
other. Prince Kourakin, who had offered to conduct me back to the Hermitage
from the Grand Du|che&s;s, and who was engaged to &s;up with the Grand Duke,
was not a little embarra&s;&s;ed; for the doors, opened to let in company, were
&s;hut; and I had no other re&s;ource but to &s;it in the guard-room of the
Duche&s;s, till Prince Kourakin's &s;ervant &s;hould find one of the carriages
belonging either to me or my party. The Prince went in to &s;up, but the Grand
Duche&s;s hearing this circum&s;tance &s;ent me a very fine peli&s;&s;e, which
I told the Prince I really did not want; but he in|formed me I mu&s;t put it
on, &s;o I did; and in a few minutes I had a carriage; but the mo&s;t
ridiculous circum&s;tance was, that the Saxon Mini&s;ter's wife, whom I had
come to court with, thought I was gone home <PB N="181" REF="189"> in my own
carriage&mdash;the company in that, thought I was gone home with her, and gave
me up, after having paraded on the out&s;ide of the palace from door to door,
as I had on the in&s;ide. My &s;ervants at home I thought I had been invited to
&s;up at the palace&mdash;</P>
<P>The Grand Duche&s;s is fair and tall; the Duche&s;s of Wirtemberg,

not to regret infinitely, that I could not &s;tay any longer, to &s;hew how
&s;en&s;ible I was of the ho&s;pitality and magnificence with which I was
treated. The Vicechancellor, Comte d'Ofterman, is obliged to have a table for
&s;ixty foreigners every Wedne&s;day; and a widow Prince&s;s de Galitzin, a

night. The Empre&s;s is at the expence of the&s;e dinners and &s;uppers; and I
confe&s;s, I think it an excellent and royal idea, to be certain of having
hou&s;es open for the entertainment of foreign mini&s;ters and &s;trangers of

people whom they leave a card with, to dine with them upon &s;uch a day; but,
if I was to &s;tay here ten years, I &s;hould never be prevailed upon to go to
tho&s;e hou&s;es to dine without invitation; nor can I believe it po&s;&s;ible
the ma&s;ters of them can expect a foreigner to grace their table, without
being de&s;ired even by word of mouth. I am a&s;|&s;ured I &s;hall affront
&mdash; and &mdash; but as I meet them every where, I cannot think they
&s;hould be &s;o totally ignorant of the manners of other countries, to expect
me to dine at their hou&s;e without a&s;king me. There is a cu&s;tom here which
I think very abominable; noblemen, who are engaged to marry young ladies, make
no ceremony, but embrace them in the mid&s;t of a large company at a

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>MOSCOW, 
<DATE>Feb. 29, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Left my coach at Peter&s;burgh, and hi|red for my&s;elf and my
&s;mall &s;uite, the car|riages of the country, called Kibitkas; they are
exactly like cradles, the head having windows to the front which let down; I
can &s;it or lie down, and feel in one like a great child, very comfortably
defended from the cold by pillows and blankets. The&s;e car|riages are upon
&s;ledges, and where the road is good, this conveyance is comforta|ble and not
fatiguing; but from the incre|dible quantity of &s;ledges that go con&s;tantly
upon the track of &s;now, it is worn in tracks like a road; and from the
&s;haking and vio|lent thumps the carriage receives, I am con|vinced the
harde&s;t head might be broken. I was overturned twice; the po&s;tillions I
fancy are u&s;ed to &s;uch accidents; for they <PB N="186" REF="194"> get
quietly off their hor&s;e, &s;et the carriage up again, and never a&s;k if the
traveller is hurt. Their method of driving is &s;ingu|lar: they &s;it behind
three hor&s;es that are harne&s;&s;ed abrea&s;t&mdash;a &s;hrill whi&s;tling
noi&s;e, or a &s;avage kind of &s;hriek is the &s;ignal for the hor&s;es to
&s;et off, which they do full gal|lop; and when their pace &s;lackens, the
dri|ver waves his right-hand, &s;hrieks or whi&s;tles, and the hor&s;es obey. I
am told the whip is unmercifully u&s;ed in the &s;tables; I ob|&s;erved a
po&s;tillion never &s;trikes a hor&s;e in driving; which cau&s;ed my
a&s;toni&s;hment at their being &s;o tractable to the rai&s;ing of a hand only.
I would never advi&s;e a travel|ler to &s;et out from Peter&s;burgh as I have,
ju&s;t at the end of the carnival; he might with &s;ome rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;e it
is a religious duty for the Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ant to be drunk; in mo&s;t
villages I &s;aw a &s;ledge loaded with young men and women in &s;uch a manner,
that four hor&s;es would have been more pro|per to draw it than one, which
wretched bea&s;t was obliged to fly with this noi&s;y company up and down the
village, which is generally compo&s;ed of hou&s;es in &s;traight 
<PB N="187" REF="195"> rows on each &s;ide of the public road. The girls are
dre&s;&s;ed in their holiday-clothes, and &s;ome are beautiful, and do not look
le&s;s &s;o from various coloured handkerchiefs tied over their forehead, in a
becoming and <HI>pittore&s;que</HI> manner. There is one particular piece of
roguery practi&s;ed after this diver&s;i|on upon travellers, which ought to be
put an end to: the hor&s;e employed upon the&s;e fe&s;tive occa&s;ions is
generally upon the point of death; and the fir&s;t po&s;t-hor&s;e that is
wanted, that hor&s;e is harne&s;&s;ed to a kibitka in his place, becau&s;e a
traveller is obliged to pay the value of any hor&s;e that dies in his
&s;ervice. I had one that died thus, though I remon&s;trated upon his being put
to the collar, &s;eeing that he was dying&mdash;but unle&s;s I could have armed
&s;ix &s;ervants with good cudgels, my arguments were as fruitle&s;s as tho&s;e
employed at the next po&s;t, to prove how unrea&s;onable it was, that I
&s;hould pay a great deal of money for a dead hor&s;e, that was dying when he
was put to the car|riage&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="196"> The Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ant is a fine, &s;tout,
&s;traight, well-looking man; &s;ome of the women, as I &s;aid before, are
uncommonly pretty; but the general whitene&s;s of their teeth is &s;omething
that cannot be conceiv|ed; it frequently happened that all the men of the
village were in a circle round my car|riages&mdash;and rows of the mo&s;t
beautiful ori|ental pearl cannot be more regular and white than their teeth. It
is a matter of great a&s;toni&s;hment to me, how the infants outlive the
treatment they receive, till they are able to crawl into the air; there is a
kind of &s;pace or <HI>entre&s;ol</HI> over every &s;tove, in which the
hu&s;band, wife, and children lie the greate&s;t part of the day, and where
they &s;leep at night&mdash;the heat appeared to me &s;o great that I have no
conception how they bear it; but they were as much &s;urpri&s;ed at me for
&s;eeking a door or window in every hou&s;e I was obliged to go into, as I
could po&s;&s;ibly be at their living in a manner with|out air. The children
look all pale and &s;ickly, till they are five or &s;ix years old. The hou&s;es
and dre&s;&s;es of the pea&s;ants are by no means uncomfortable; the fir&s;t is
ge|nerally <PB N="189" REF="197"> compo&s;ed of wood, the latter of
&s;heep-&s;kins; but trees laid horizontally one upon another makes a very
&s;trong wall, and the climate requires a warm &s;kin for cloth|ing. It might
appear to Engli&s;h minds, that a people who are in a manner the pro|perty of
their lord, &s;uffer many of the af|flictions that attend &s;lavery; but the
very circum&s;tance of their per&s;ons being the pro|perty in&s;ures them the
indulgence of their ma&s;ter for the pre&s;ervation of their lives; and that
ma&s;ter &s;tands between them and the power of a de&s;potic government or a
brutal &s;oldiery. Be&s;ide, my dear Sir, the invaluable advantage which
the&s;e pea&s;ants have, as in paying annually a very &s;mall &s;um each, and
cultivating as many acres of land as he thinks fit, his fortune depends
entirely upon his own indu&s;try; each man only pays about the value of
half-a-guinea a year. If his lord would rai&s;e this tax too high, or make
their va&s;&s;als &s;uffer; mi&s;ery and de&s;ertion would ruin his fortune,
not theirs; it is true, that a lord is obliged to give one man as a recruit
yearly out of &s;uch a number; but it is one out of three or 
<PB N="190" REF="198"> four hundred; &s;o that notwith&s;tanding this great
empire is &s;aid not to be popu|lated in proportion to the extent of it; when
you reflect what a number of troops the Empre&s;s has, and the&s;e kept up by
this method; the Ru&s;&s;ian people mu&s;t be more numerous than &s;trangers
may imagine, in travelling through this country. It is very amu&s;ing to me to
reflect, without prejudices of any kind, upon the ridiculous ideas of liberty
and property that our Engli&s;h com|mon people have; for &mdash;</P>
<P>And now, my mo&s;t honoured and dear brother, that I have given you
&s;o pretty a picture of Engli&s;h liberty&mdash;I &s;hall wi&s;h you a good

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>MOSCOW, 
<DATE>March 3, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Believe I have not told you, that I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all
the in&s;tructions to proceed upon this new journey in a very plea&s;ant
manner. The commanders at Krement-chouck and at Cher&s;on are informed of my
intention to proceed to Perekop, where I &s;hall enter into that penin&s;ula
called the Tauride, which, from the climate and &s;itu|ation, I look upon to be
a delicious coun|try; and an acqui&s;ition to Ru&s;&s;ia which &s;he &s;hould
never relinqui&s;h. I mu&s;t take off your attention, for &s;ome time from your
own people and my journey, and, in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, &s;hew by
remote and pa&s;t ages, that the Tauride mu&s;t naturally become a trea&s;ure
to po&s;terity. Long be|fore Homer, the fir&s;t inhabitants of it that can be
traced were the Cimmerians; a nu|merous <PB N="192" REF="200"> and warlike
people, de&s;cendants of the Thracians; in their incur&s;ions into A&s;ia
Minor, they were robbed by the Scy|thians of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but
pre&s;erved the Crimea longer than the re&s;t of them; the Scythians drove them
from the flat country 656 years before Chri&s;t; but they remained concealed in
the mountains, calling them|&s;elves Taourians&mdash;and from thence the
pen|in&s;ula took the name of Taourica&mdash;Taou|rinia&mdash;or Tauris. The
Greeks began to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in the &s;ixth century be|fore
Chri&s;t. The Mile&s;ians built a town called Panticapoeum or Bo&s;porus, now
called Kierche; and Theodo&s;ia, which at pre&s;ent is mo&s;tly called Kaffa.
The Em|pre&s;s has ordered this town to be re&s;tored to the original Greek
name Theodo&s;ia; it is at pre&s;ent a town of no incon&s;iderable com|merce.
Before I proceed to follow the vari|ations which the changes, and I may &s;ay
mixtures of nations that have governed this country, and have produced the
pre&s;ent an|nexion of it to Ru&s;&s;ia, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that, according to
my u&s;ual mode of tracing ex|traordinary appearances to their primitive 
<PB N="193" REF="201"> cau&s;es&mdash;I yet think I am perfectly right in
perceiving a lineal de&s;cent in many Ru&s;&s;ians from the Greeks. The
darkne&s;s in which we are lo&s;t, when we turn back to nations conquered by
&s;avage unlettered people, puts a &s;top to all certainty as to genealogy; but
when the Greeks by terror and oppre&s;|&s;ion were driven from Theodo&s;ia, and
other towns on the &s;ea&mdash;coa&s;t&mdash;is it not very natu|ral to
&s;uppo&s;e that they wandered, or were driven farther up into the country, and
that by degrees their de&s;cendants peopled a country, which nothing but
nece&s;&s;ity forced them to inhabit? Many marks of &s;uperior genius have
pierced through all the diffi|culties that ignorance and the climate have
occa&s;ioned, and &s;hewn them&s;elves in the Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ant, nor
&s;hould I wonder to find, if their genius was traced, it de&s;cend|ed from a
Thales or an Alcibiades. Let us return to hi&s;tory&mdash;480 years before the
birth of Chri&s;t, the people from Mitylene &s;ounded a monarchy in the Crimea,
which was governed forty-two years afterwards by Spartacus. This King and his
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors, we are told, favoured the Greeks, particu|larly 
<PB N="194" REF="202"> the Athenians, and drove away the Scythians in a great
mea&s;ure; but they were entirely exterminated by the Sarmati|ans. At this
period, the Taourians from the mountains mole&s;ted the new monarchy, till
Mithridrates, King of Pontus, about 112 years before the birth of Chri&s;t
&s;ubdued them, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole penin&s;ula. About the
birth of Chri&s;t, the Alains made the Kings, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of
Bo&s;|phorus, his tributaries, and drove away the Taourians. The&s;e new
ma&s;ters held their power about a century and a half. In the &s;econd century
the Goths &s;ucceeded to the Alains, and it was under their dominion that
Chri&s;tianity was fir&s;t introduced into the Crimea. During the lives of
Diocletian and Con&s;tantine the Great, bi&s;hopricks were created. But the
Goths were obliged to &s;ubmit to the Huns, and like all other
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Crimea, when driven from the plains, they, in their
turn, took refuge in the mountains, where they had their own &s;overeigns, who
were Chri&s;tians; at that time there remained &s;ome of the Alains in the
mountains likewi&s;e, and a few were di&s;|per&s;ed <PB N="195" REF="203"> over
the plains. About the fourth century, what was called the kingdom of
Bo&s;phorus cea&s;ed to exi&s;t as a kingdom; the Hungarians entered the Crimea
in 464, they having, with the Bulgarians, all the country between the Don and
the Dnei&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Goths and Alains went to Taman, where they &s;ettled
habitations. The de&s;cen|dants of the Hungarians took the name of
Aoultziagrians, and led a wandering life in the Crimea, but were obliged to
&s;ubmit to the Khatyares, who made likewi&s;e the Goths in the mountains, and
the Grecian towns on the coa&s;t, their tributaries. About the eighth century
the Goths attempted a revolt, but were &s;ubdued, yet were go|verned among
them&s;elves by their own Kings. In the year 840, the Emperor Theophilus
erected a government at Cher|&s;on, to which he &s;ubjected all the other towns
of the Crimea and Kouban, for though the&s;e countries were tributary to the
Khatyares, they acknowledged the &s;o|vereignty of the Byzantian court.
Not|with&s;tanding <PB N="196" REF="204"> this, from the time the Khat|yares
had fir&s;t conquered the Crimea, that penin&s;ula had taken the name of Khat,
or Gatyaria, except the mountainous part, which was called Gothia, from the
Goths, and T&s;ikia, from the remaining Alains&mdash;Jews were then numerous in
the Crimea&mdash;</P>
<P>The Petchenegues or Kanglis, in 882, drove the Hungarians from the
Crimea; but beyond the I&s;thmus of Or, remained two detached branches of
Bulgarians and Hungarians, known in the annals of Ru&s;&s;ia by the name of
Berendec, or Black Bul|garians; from this period the Khatyares pre&s;erved no
power but in A&s;ia, where it was likewi&s;e annihilated in 1015; yet even then
the Crimea pre&s;erved the name of Khatyaria&mdash;</P>
<P>About the eleventh century, the Petche|negues were obliged to give
up that penin&s;ula and mo&s;t of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to the Ko|manes,
otherwi&s;e called Butyes or Polouzes, who likewi&s;e &s;ubdued the Goths and
Greeks that were left in it. At this period of time the town of Sougdaia, now
called Soudak, <PB N="197" REF="205"> became &s;o con&s;iderable from the
commerce and trade carried on there, that all the land po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the
Greeks in the Crimea was called after it Soudak&mdash;</P>
<P>Till the year 1204 they acknowledged the &s;overeignty of the
Byzantian empire; but then they made them&s;elves indepen|dent, or &s;ubmitted
to the power of different princes, &s;o that when the Ottomans con|quered that
country, there exi&s;ted two principalities, one called Theodor, now Inkerman;
and the other Gothia, now called Mangoute. In 1237, the Polouzes were &s;ubdued
in the Crimea by the Mon|gouls or Tartars, who were governed in clans by their
princes, by the titles of Ouloug Beigh, in the plains, till Menguelci-Ghierai
converted the Crimea into a kind of &s;tate. The Goths and Greeks paid a
tribute to the Mongouls, as they had be|fore to the Polouzes. In the fir&s;t
part of the Tartarian reign, a number of Tcher, Kafes or Circa&s;&s;ians,
e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the Crimea in 1333; that part called Kierche
was governed by a Prince of that <PB N="198" REF="206"> nation; and, as the
Tartars carried on a great trade in the town of Krim, the pen|in&s;ula took the
name of Krim, by which only it is known to the Orientals at this hour. While
the Latins were ma&s;ters of Con&s;tantinople, they carried on a
con&s;ide|rable trade at Krim, Tamane, and Tana; the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
traders were the Ve|netians. But when the Genoe&s;e, by a treaty with the
Emperor Michael Paleologus, had obtained an exemption of all duties in the
Grecian &s;tates, and a free navigation in the Black Sea, they began to
monopolife all the trade of the Crimea; bloody wars en|&s;ued, in which they
were almo&s;t con&s;tantly victorious. They rebuilt, with the con&s;ent of the
Mongoul Khan, the town of Kaffa; made it the chief repo&s;itory or capital of
their commerce, and at la&s;t of &s;uch con&s;e|quence, that Kaffa, for a time,
was the name by which the penin&s;ula was called. By degrees they conquered
Soudak, and Cembals, now called Balouklava; it is true, they paid a tribute to
the Mongouls, while the&s;e pre&s;erved their power; but when their own
inte&s;tine divi&s;ions had weakened <PB N="199" REF="207"> it, the Genoe&s;e
&s;hook off their yoke, and the Mongoulian or Tartarian Princes were elected or
depo&s;ed as the Genoe&s;e thought fit. It was at this period that the trade
from India to the Crimea was divided into two branches by the Amou, the
Ca&s;pian Sea, and A&s;trakan&mdash;one ended at Tana; the other proceeded by
Bagdad and Tauris to Trape&s;ond and Sava&s;topolis. Tana be|longed to the
Genoe&s;e and Venetians, un|der the &s;upremacy of the Mongouls; the Genoe&s;e
had their con&s;uls at Trapo&s;ond and Sava&s;topolis.</P>
<P>In 1575 the Genoe&s;e lo&s;t their power in the Crimea, by the Turks
having con|quered Kaffa, Soudak, and Balouklava, and Tana upon the Don. The&s;e
new con|querors put an end to the principalities of the Goths and of Theodori,
e&s;tabli&s;hed garri&s;ons in all the principal towns upon the coa&s;t, and by
that mea&s;ure checked the power of the Khans of the Crimea; the&s;e however,
till the year 1584, were rather the allies than the &s;ubjects of the Porte,
till it attained the power of naming them, or <PB N="200" REF="208"> confirming
their nomination, when they ventured to be cho&s;en without having
pre|viou&s;ly obtained the &s;anction of the Ottoman council&mdash;</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h cabinet began by e&s;tabli&s;h|ing at Kaffa a Sandjak,
and then a Behjler|beghjilik, which governed all the domains belonging to the
Porte either in the Crimea, on the borders of the Don, or upon the &s;ea of
A&s;oph, and left a very &s;trong garri&s;on in that town to intimidate the
Khans. But from the wretched policy of the Turks, they at the &s;ame time
&s;hut up the entrance of the Black Sea to other European nati|ons, &s;o that
trade and commerce were almo&s;t ruined in the Crimea, and the ex|ports, from
that time to this, were con|fined to the productions of the country and
&s;laves&mdash;</P>
<P>The great market for the Circa&s;&s;ians, of which we have heard
&s;o much and know &s;o little, was at Kaffa; where they came and &s;old their
children to Greeks, Genoe&s;e, Jews, or Armenians, who &s;old them in their
turn <PB N="201" REF="209"> at Con&s;tantinople, but that was before the Turks
had extended their power over the Crimea&mdash;</P>
<P>When the &s;overeignty of the penin&s;ula pa&s;&s;ed to
Mengheli-Gherai, there were but few Tartarian inhabitants; but the wars he was
engaged in again&s;t them, on the borders of the Volga, gave him an
oppor|tunity to bring back into the Crimea with him many thou&s;and Nogais,
which he oblig|ed to fix there, in this method of peo|pling the country, he was
followed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who furni&s;hed the Kouban, and the country
between the Don and the Dnei&s;ter with their pri&s;oners&mdash;</P>
<P>The Crimea was for a long time a formi|dable power to the
Ru&s;&s;ians and Poles, till the&s;e nations became improved in military
&s;cience. Until the peace of Karlowitz, both the&s;e nations were obliged to
pay the Khan to the amount of 100,000 rixdollars, to in&s;ure their countries
from the incur&s;ions of the Tartars; Ru&s;&s;ia has gained ground by degrees,
and by arms and policy is be|come <PB N="202" REF="210"> ma&s;ter of the
penin&s;ula; the la&s;t Khan has a pen&s;ion from the Empre&s;s, and is
re|tired to live as a private gentleman; long before he re&s;igned his
&s;overeignty; the Turki&s;h cabinet on one &s;ide; the crafty policy of the
Ru&s;&s;ians on the other, left him no peace; even &s;ome hordes of Tartars
in&s;ulted his tottering power. Thus, my dear Sir, I have &s;ummed up as well
as I am able, a &s;ketch of the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent revo|lutions that happened
in the country I am proceeding to, in which there are at pre&s;ent about thirty
thou&s;and of the Empre&s;s's troops, including five thou&s;and Co&s;&s;acks in
her pay; which I am very curious to &s;ee. The Khan's palaces, noble Tartar
hou&s;es, and others are prepared for her re|ception, in which I am a&s;&s;ured
I &s;hall be received and treated perfectly well. Not|with&s;tanding all that
has been &s;aid to deter me from continuing my tour, I &s;hall certain|ly go
on, and if I am not poi&s;oned by the waters in Tartary, or drowned in my
pa&s;|&s;age by the Black Sea to Con&s;tantinople, I &s;hall, I hope, afford
you &s;ome amu&s;ement <PB N="203" REF="211"> in the geographical
de&s;criptions I &s;hall give you, and variety of military figures: who though
not ver&s;ed in tactics like your Pru&s;|&s;ian troops, may always entertain
any per|&s;on, who, like you, are a good &s;oldier by in|heritance, example,

<P>I Was obliged to put my kibitkas on wheels at a vile little town
called Soumi, before I arrived at Pultawa. Notwith&s;tand|ing there might have
been many things worth &s;topping to look at in the immen&s;e town of Mo&s;cow,
I was &s;o impatient to meet the &s;pring, that I would not &s;end my name to
any per&s;on who&s;e civilities would have obliged me to &s;tay. I cannot &s;ay
that Mo&s;|cow gives me any other idea than of a large village, or many
villages joined, as the hou&s;es &s;tand at &s;uch a di&s;tance, and it is
&s;uch a ter|rible way to go to vi&s;it things or people, that I &s;hould have
made as many long journeys in a week, as there are days in one, had I &s;taid.
What is particularly gaudy and ugly at Mo&s;cow are the &s;teeples, &s;quare
lumps of <PB N="205" REF="213"> different coloured bricks and gilt &s;pires or
ovals; they make a very Gothic appearance, but it is thought a public beauty
there; a widow lady was ju&s;t dead, who having outlived all the people that
&s;he loved, &s;he left an immen&s;e &s;um of money to gild with the pure&s;t
gold, the top of one of the &s;teeples&mdash;</P>
<P>At Pultawa I was &s;hewn the ground on which the armies moved, a
memorable check to the wild &s;pirit of Charles the Twelfth. A private
per&s;on, one Paul Budenkof, has, at his own expence, erected a monument in
remembrance of that event; it is a plate of bra&s;s, on which is repre&s;ented
the battle in a good engraving, the plate is fixed into a pillar. At Soumi I
conver&s;ed with a brother of Prince Kourakin's and a Mr. Lan&s;koy, both
officers quartered there; and to whom I was indebted for a lodging: they
obliged a Jew to give me up a new little hou&s;e he was upon the point of
inha|biting. The thaw had come on &s;o quickly <PB N="206" REF="214"> that I
was obliged to &s;tay two days while my carriages were taken off the
&s;ledges&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Lan&s;koy has a little of the beauty and &s;weetne&s;s of
countenance of his cou&s;in who died; the favourite of the Empre&s;s; and who,
if his pictures and the medal do not flatter him, was perfectly beautiful. Both
Prince Kourakin and Lan&s;koy are very impatient to quit &s;uch di&s;mal
quarters, and &s;eem to de&s;ire &s;ome event in which they may di&s;play a
military ardour, very natural to &s;oldiers, and increa&s;ed in them by having
no poli&s;hed people to conver&s;e with; as I found, upon my a&s;king what
&s;ociety they had, their account of the country nobles thereabout was truly
laugh|able&mdash;</P>
<P>There is no gentleman's hou&s;e at Pul|tawa; I &s;lept at my
banker's, and walked all about the &s;kirts of the town&mdash;</P>
<P>At Chrementchouk, the general who commands has a very pretty
well-bred wife, <PB N="207" REF="215"> who did the honours of her hou&s;e and
the place perfectly well. Prince Potemkin has a large hou&s;e ju&s;t out of the
town, which I went to &s;ee; at the Governor's I a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a dinner
where there was &s;uch a num|ber of people, and &s;o much company after dinner,
that I was heartily tired; there I began to find the manner in which I was
recommended by the prince; the greate&s;t attentions and re&s;pect were paid
me. An Engli&s;h woman, married to a Ru&s;&s;ian who was there, came to my
lodging, and looking earne&s;tly at me, &s;aid, are you an Engli&s;h lady? I
&s;miled and &s;aid, quite &s;o: &s;he flung her arms round my neck, and
almo&s;t &s;mo|thered me with ki&s;&s;es; forgive me, &s;aid &s;he, I too was
born in England, and have never had the happine&s;s of &s;eeing a
country-wo|man &s;ince I left it; I am married, have children here, and
probably &s;hall never &s;ee England again. I was intreated to &s;tay by all
the ladies at lea&s;t &s;ome days; but I can|not defer too long letting &mdash;
know what is become of me; I concealed from &mdash; and &mdash; my intended
journey, and only wrote word from Peter&s;burgh, that I was 
<PB N="208" REF="216"> going to make a little tour to a warmer part of that
country; and I mean not to let either of them know where I am till I get &s;afe
to Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>I am going to &s;ee the Dock-Yard here and the fortifications, which
are to be new done by a Colonel Kor&s;akof, a very civil &s;pirited young man
here, who &s;eems to have the welfare of this place and the honour of his
nation very much at heart. I &s;hall give you an account of what I have &s;een

<P>THIS place is &s;ituated upon the Dneiper, called by the ancients,
the Bori&s;thenes; which falls into the Black Sea; the only inconvenience of
the Docks here is that the &s;hips, when built, are obliged to be taken with
camels into that part of the channel deep enough to receive them. The town is
not at pre&s;ent very large, though there are many new hou&s;es and a church
built after pretty models; good architecture of white &s;tone. There are no
trees near this place; Kor&s;akof is trying to make large plantations; the town
is intirely furni&s;hed with fuel by reeds, of which there is an
in|exhau&s;tible fore&s;t in the &s;hallows of the Bori&s;thenes, ju&s;t facing
Cher&s;on; Rails, and even temporary hou&s;es are made of them. The&s;e reeds
are &s;trong and tall, and are a <PB N="210" REF="219"> harbour for birds of
various kind, particu|larly aquatics; of which there are &s;uch a number, and
of &s;uch beautiful kinds, that I can conceive nothing &s;o entertaining as
&s;hooting parties in boats here; Kor&s;akof, and a Captain Mordwinof, who both
have been educated in England, will, I have no doubt, make a di&s;tingui&s;hed
figure in the military annals of Ru&s;&s;ia; Mordwinof is a &s;ea-officer, and
&s;uperintends the &s;hip-build|ing here; there are &s;ome very pretty frigates
on the &s;tocks. Repnin&s;kai is the gover|nor's name, and he has a young wife,
who is very civil; my loding is a large hou&s;e built for a Greek Archbi&s;hop;
but, being empty, was appropriated to my u&s;e: I have remon&s;trated here, but
in vain, again&s;t having centinels, and the guard turning out as I pa&s;s
through the gates. I hate all kind of ceremony and honours, particularly &s;uch
as I am not accu&s;tomed to, but I am told here I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with
not refu&s;|ing the orders that are given; the Empe|ror's Con&s;ul has a wife
who wears a Greek dre&s;s here; I think it by no means
becom|ing&mdash;Cher&s;on may in time become a very <PB N="211" REF="220">
beautiful town, and furni&s;h the borders of the Bori&s;thenes with examples of
com|merce; that ine&s;timable and only real &s;ource of greatne&s;s to an

fortifications, &s;o that they are intirely to be done anew&mdash;but by the
active and &s;tudious &s;pirit of Kor&s;akof, I have no doubt that they will be
executed in a ma&s;terly manner&mdash;</P>
<P>I can conceive nothing &s;o plea&s;ant to a young &s;oldier, as to

<P>I have nothing but maps and plans of various &s;orts in my head at
pre&s;ent, having looked over all &s;uch as my curio&s;ity could induce me to
a&s;k for. The fortifications and plantations are executed here by

horror into my heart, as I walked over them, particularly when I was inform|ed
there are between three and four thou|&s;and. Yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I think

<P>Mordwinof informs me, the frigate which is to convey me to

&s;eaports in the Crimea, and that the Comte de Wynowitch, who commands at
Seva&s;topole has directions to accommodate me in the be&s;t manner; Mordwinof

<P>I Went in a barge for about two hours down the Bori&s;thenes, and
landed on the &s;hore oppo&s;ite to that on which Cher&s;on &s;tands. A
carriage and hor&s;es belonging to a Major who commands a po&s;t about two
hours drive from the place where I landed were waiting, and the&s;e conveyed me
to his hou&s;e, where I found a great dinner prepared, and he gave me &s;ome
excellent fre&s;h-butter made of Buffalo's milk; this poor man has ju&s;t
lo&s;t a wife he loved, and who was the only delight he could po&s;&s;e&s;s in
a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;pot, mar&s;hy, low, and where he can have no other
amu&s;e|ment but the troops. From thence I cro&s;&s;ed the plains of Perekop,
on which nothing but a large coar&s;e gra&s;s grows, which is burnt at certain
periods of the year. All <PB N="214" REF="223"> this country, like that between
Cher&s;on and Chrementchruh, is called Steps, I &s;hould call it de&s;ert;
except where the po&s;t-hor&s;es are found, not a tree not a habita|tion is to
be &s;een. But one thing which delighted me much, for &s;everal miles after I
had quitted Cher&s;on, was the immen&s;e flocks of birds; bu&s;tards, which I
took at a certain di&s;tance for herds of calves, and millions of a &s;mall
bird about the &s;ize of a pigeon, cinnamon colour and white; droves of a kind
of wild &s;mall goo&s;e, cinnamon colour, brown, and white. As I went farther
on, the&s;e multitudes decrea&s;ed, not choo&s;ing I &s;uppo&s;e to go too far
from their &s;helter, the reeds&mdash;</P>
<P>Perekop is &s;ituated upon an eminence; the ditch of it &s;eems
rather calculated for the lodgment of an enemy than a defence. The governor did
every thing he could to detain me a few hours; but, as there was nothing to
&s;ee, I went on. Ju&s;t without the fortre&s;s of Perekop I was obliged to
&s;end one of my &s;ervants to a Tartar village to get a pa&s;s; the &s;ervant
whom I &s;ent, who&s;e <PB N="215" REF="224"> ridiculous fears through the
whole journey have not a little amu&s;ed me, came back as pale as death. He
told me the chiefs were &s;it|ting in a circle &s;moaking, that they were very
ill black-looking people; I looked at the pa&s;s, it was in Turki&s;h or
Tartarian characters. I &s;aw there two camels drawing a cart; this village
gave me no great opinion of Tartarian cleanline&s;s, a more dirty mi&s;era|ble
looking place I never &s;aw. The land at Perekop is but &s;ix miles acro&s;s
from the &s;ea of A&s;oph, or rather an arm of it called the Sua&s;h, to the
Black Sea. The Crimea might with great ea&s;e be made an i&s;land; after
leaving Perekop, the country is exactly like what we call downs in England, and
the turf is like the fine&s;t green velvet. The hor&s;es flew along; and though
there was not a hor&s;e in the &s;tables of the po&s;t-hou&s;es, I did not wait
long to have them harne&s;&s;ed; the Co&s;&s;acks have the furni&s;hing of the
hor&s;es, and ver&s;ts or mile-&s;tones are put up; the hor&s;es were all
gra&s;ing on the plain at &s;ome di&s;tance, but the in&s;tant they &s;ee their
Co&s;&s;ack come out with a little corn the whole herd &s;urrounds him, and he
takes <PB N="216" REF="225"> tho&s;e he plea&s;es. The po&s;ts were &s;ometimes
in a de&s;erted Tartarian village, and &s;ome|times the only habitation for the
&s;table-keeper was a hut made under ground, a common habitation in this
country, where the &s;un is extremely hot, and there is no &s;hade of any
&s;ort. To the left of Perekop I &s;aw &s;everal lakes about the third po&s;t;
it was a mo&s;t beautiful &s;ight. About &s;un-&s;et I arrived at a Tartarian
village, of hou&s;es or rather huts &s;traggling in a circle without fence of
any kind. At different &s;pots upon the downs, large herds of hor&s;es, cows,
and &s;heep were approaching, with a &s;low pace, the village; making at once a
&s;imple and maje&s;tic land&s;cape, full of that peace and plenty which
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the primitive &s;tate of the world might have
en|joyed&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;topped there and made tea; that I might go on, as far as I
could that night. You mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e, my dear Sir, though I have left
my coach and harp at Peter&s;|burgh, that I have not all my little
nece&s;&s;a|ries even in a kibitka&mdash;a tin-kettle in a ba&s;|ket

<P>ABOUT half an hour after ten la&s;t night I ordered my &s;ervants
not to have the hor&s;es put to, as I intended to &s;leep, for the only thing
in which I am a bad travel|ler is, that I cannot go to &s;leep while the
carriage is in motion. I had not an idea of getting out of it, as our Po&s;t
was a vile Tartar village; in a few minutes the &s;er|vants called me, and
&s;aid, the General's ne|phew and &s;on were arrived to meet me, and very
&s;orry to find I had quitted Perekop, as they had orders to e&s;cort me from
thence. I opened my carriage and &s;aw two very pretty looking young men; I
told them I &s;hould certainly not think of detaining them; and we &s;et off,
nor did I &s;u&s;pect that there were any per&s;ons with me but them: at
&mdash; o'clock I let down the forepart of my carriage to &s;ee the &s;un
ri&s;e; when, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, I &s;aw a guard of between twenty and
thirty Co&s;&s;acks, with an officer, who was clo&s;e to the fore-wheel of the
car|riage; <PB N="219" REF="228"> upon &s;eeing me he &s;miled and pulled off
his cap&mdash;his companions gave a mo&s;t vi|olent &s;hriek, and hor&s;es,
carriages, and all increa&s;ed their pace, &s;o that the hor&s;es in the
carriage behind mine took fright, ran away, and running again&s;t my carriage
very nearly overturned it; and when I a&s;k|ed what occa&s;ioned this event, I
found my Co&s;&s;ack e&s;cort, &s;eeing my carriage &s;hut, thought I was dead;
as a Co&s;&s;ack has no idea that a per&s;on in health can travel in a carriage
that is not open, and the &s;hout I had heard, the &s;mile I had &s;een, was
the &s;urpri&s;e they had felt, that the young Eng|li&s;h prince&s;s, as they
called me, was alive; as they believed it was only my corp&s;e that was
conveying to Kara&s;bazar to be buried. They always ride with long pikes,
holding the points upwards; the Tartars ride with pikes, but they hold the ends
of theirs to the ground. About &s;ix I pa&s;&s;ed the Tartar town of
Kara&s;bazar, lying to the left&mdash;and arrived at the General's hou&s;e, a
very good one, newly built for the recepti|on of the Empre&s;s; the General
Kokotch|ki, his brother the governor, and almo&s;t all the general officers
were up and dre&s;&s;ed; <PB N="220" REF="229"> upon the &s;teps of the hou&s;e
I found my&s;elf in my night-cap, a mo&s;t tired and forlorn figure, in the
mid&s;t of well-powdered men, and as many &s;tars and ribbons around me as if I
had been at a birth-day at St. James's. I retired, but ro&s;e again at one,
dre&s;&s;ed and dined, and looked about me; this hou&s;e is &s;ituated near the
river Kara&s;ou or Black|water, which bathes the lawn before the hou&s;e, and
runs in many windings towards the town; it is narrow, rapid, and very clear;
this is a mo&s;t rural and lovely &s;pot, very well calculated to give the
Empre&s;s a good opinion of her new kingdom, for &s;o it may be called. I had a
Co&s;&s;ack chief pre|&s;ented to me, a &s;oldier-like fine white|haired
figure, he wore a ribband and order the Empre&s;s had given him &s;et round
with brillants. The general told me he was &s;orry he was not thirty years
younger, as the Empre&s;s had not a braver officer in her &s;ervice. In the
evening, in an amazing large hall, &s;everal different bands of mu&s;ic played;
and I heard the national &s;ongs of the Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ants, which are &s;o
&s;ingular that I cannot forbear endeavouring to give <PB N="221" REF="230">
you &s;ome idea of them. One man &s;tands in the mid&s;t of three or four, who
make a circle round him; &s;even or eight more make a &s;econd round tho&s;e; a
third is compo&s;ed of a greater number; the man in the mid|dle of this groupe
begins, and when he has &s;ung one ver&s;e, the fir&s;t circle accompany him,
and then the &s;econd, till they become &s;o animated, and the noi&s;e &s;o
great, that it was with difficulty the officers could &s;top them. What is very
&s;ingular they &s;ing in parts, and though the mu&s;ic is not much varied nor
the tune fine, yet as &s;ome take thirds and fifths as their ear direct, in
per|fect harmony, it is by no means unplea&s;ing. If you a&s;k one of them why
he does not &s;ing the &s;ame note as the man before him, he does not know what
you mean. The &s;ubjects of the&s;e ballads are, hunting, war, or
counterfeiting the gradations between &s;oberne&s;s into intoxication, and very
di|verting. As the&s;e &s;ingers were only young Ru&s;&s;ian pea&s;ants, they
began with great timidity, but by little and little ended in a kind of wild
jollity, which made us all laugh very heartily. The Governor's re&s;idence is 
<PB N="222" REF="231"> not here, but at a place called Atchmechet; he is only
come here to meet and conduct me through the Crimea; he is a grave
&s;en|&s;ible mild man. I am told he has conciliated the Tartars to their
change of &s;overeign very much by his gentlene&s;s and firmne&s;s. To their
honour, I find none would &s;tay who could not bear the idea of taking the
oaths of allegiance, but are gone towards Mount Cauca&s;us. They have repented
&s;ince, but it was too late. All the country here is downs except the borders
of vallies, where rice is cultivated, and what the Tartars call gardens, which
I call orchards. I cannot tell you, Sir, with what re&s;pect and atten|tion I
am treated here, and how good-na|turedly all the que&s;tions I a&s;k are
an&s;wer|ed&mdash;</P>
<P>There is an Albanian Chief here, though his po&s;t is at Bilaklava,
a &s;ea-port; he is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Empre&s;s likewi&s;e for his
bravery; his dre&s;s differs much from the Co&s;&s;ack; it is &s;omething like
the ancient Romans&mdash;he is an elderly man too. In a day or two I &s;hall
give you an account of <PB N="223" REF="232"> the &s;ource of the Kara&s;ou,
and take my leave of this place for Batcheferai, the prin|cipal town and

<P>YESTERDAY I went to &s;ee the &s;ource of the river, it lies in the
rece&s;s of a rock, which is placed between many others that line the &s;teep
&s;ides of a valley; a Major Ri|bas, a very lively hand&s;ome officer of the
Cha&s;&s;eurs, has drawn it for me. I rode a white hor&s;e of the general's, a
very quiet creature, but awakward, not being u&s;ed to a
&s;ide-&s;addle&mdash;</P>
<P>I never &s;aw a &s;cene &s;o lively as this vi&s;it; there were near
forty people on hor&s;eback; the variety of dre&s;&s;es and colours upon the
green carpet was gay and picture&s;que. We continued going up hill to the
&s;ource, till we perceived the rocks, but the &s;ides of them were &s;o
&s;teep that we were obliged to di&s;|mount and &s;cramble down as we could; 
<PB N="225" REF="234"> this &s;pring does not pre&s;ent it&s;elf like the
Vauclu&s;e, maje&s;tic and terrible, but pretty and romantic; and might be
copied in a park where huge fragments of &s;tone could be had. As we returned,
I got off and walked be&s;ide the &s;oldiers hou&s;es, and went into &s;ome;
they are placed in a line on the declivity of the down, as they de&s;cend to
the General's hou&s;e; all things were very neat and orderly. The old
Co&s;&s;ack chief had looked with the greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment at my riding,
and when I jumped down from my hor&s;e on returning home, he ki&s;&s;ed the
edge of my petticoat, and &s;aid &s;omething in his language which I did not
comprehend, but the general told me he had paid me the highe&s;t compliment
imaginable, viz. I was worthy of being a Co&s;&s;ack&mdash;</P>
<P>In the evening I went in a carriage with the governor and general to
Kara&s;bazar; and on the road &s;aw a mock battle between the Co&s;&s;acks. As
I was not appri&s;ed before|hand, I confe&s;s the beginning of it
a&s;toni&s;h|ed me very much. I &s;aw the Co&s;&s;ack guard 
<PB N="226" REF="235"> on each &s;ide the carriage &s;pring from their
&s;tirrups, with their feet on the &s;addle and gallop away thus with a loud
&s;hriek. The General &s;miled at my a&s;toni&s;hed looks; and told me the
Co&s;&s;ack Chief had ordered an entertainment for me, and de&s;ired me to get
out and &s;tand on the ri&s;ing part of the down, facing that where a troop of
Co&s;&s;acks was po&s;ted, which I &s;aw advancing with a &s;low pace; a
detached Co&s;&s;ack of the adver&s;e party approached the troop, and turning
round &s;ought his &s;cattered compa|nions, who were in &s;earch like him of
the little army; they approached, but not in a &s;quadron, &s;ome on the left,
&s;ome on the right, &s;ome before, &s;ome behind the troop&mdash;a
&s;hriek&mdash;a pi&s;tol fired, were the &s;ignals of battle&mdash;the troop
was obliged to divide in order to face an enemy that attacked it on all
&s;ides. The greate&s;t &s;cene of hurry and agility en&s;ued; one had &s;eized
his enemy, pulled him off his hor&s;e, and was upon the point of &s;tripping
him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Co&s;&s;ack, if he can avoid it, never kills his
enemy be|fore he has &s;tripped him, becau&s;e the &s;poils are his property,
and he fears the blood &s;hould &s;poil the dre&s;s&mdash;</NOTE>, when 
<PB N="227" REF="236"> one of the pri&s;oner's party came up, laid him to the
ground, remounted his compa|nion, and rode off with the hor&s;e of the fir&s;t
victor. Some flung them&s;elves off their hor&s;es to tear their foe to the
ground; alternately they pur&s;ued or were pur&s;uing, their pikes, their
pi&s;tols, their hangers all were made u&s;e of; and when the parties were
completely engaged together, it was difficult to &s;ee all the adroit
manoeuvres that pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;</P>
<P>I was much entertained and plea&s;ed; and de&s;ired the Co&s;&s;ack
Chief might have my be&s;t thanks. I arrived at the town, and was led to the
Kadis' hou&s;e, where his wife received me, and no male creature was &s;uffered
to come into the room, except the interpreter and a young Ru&s;&s;ian nobleman
only twelve years of age. This woman had a kind of turban on, with &s;ome
indif|ferent diamonds and pearls upon it. Her nails were dyed &s;carlet, her
face painted white and red, the veins blue; &s;he appear|ed to me to be a
little &s;hrivelled woman of near &s;ixty, but I was told &s;he was not above 
<PB N="228" REF="237"> fifty. She had a kind of robe and ve&s;t on, and her
girdle was a handkerchief embroi|dered with gold and a variety of colours. She
made me a &s;ign to &s;it down; and my gloves &s;eeming to excite much
unea&s;ine&s;s in her I took them off; upon which &s;he drew near, &s;miled,
took one of my hands be|tween her's, and winked and nodded as a &s;ign of
approbation; but &s;he felt my arm up beyond the elbow, half way up my
&s;houlder, winking and nodding. I began to wonder where this extraordinary
exami|nation would end, which it did there. Coffee was brought, and after that
ro&s;e-leaves made into &s;weetmeats, both of which the interpreter obliged me
to ta&s;te. The &s;weetmeats are introduced la&s;t, and among the Orientals
they are a &s;ignal that the vi&s;it mu&s;t end. Our conver&s;ation by the
inter|preter was not very entertaining. She a&s;ked if I had a child, and told
me what I have been told &s;o often before, though I confe&s;s not by
women<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tartarian and Turki&s;h women, deriving the only
plea|&s;ures of &s;ociety from women, have none of that envy which prevails in
European female brea&s;ts&mdash;and among the Tartarian and Turki&s;h women,
the extravagant encomiums which fall from the lips of a man de&s;perately in
love with a pretty woman, are to be heard and are in frequent u&s;e.</NOTE>,
that would be <PB N="229" REF="238"> unnece&s;&s;ary to repeat it. A Tartar
hou&s;e is a very &s;light building of one &s;tory only; no chair, table, or
piece of furniture in wood to be &s;een; large cu&s;hions are ranged round the
room, on which we &s;at or reclined; but what is extremely convenient, I
ob|&s;erved more than double the &s;pace of the room behind the wain&s;cot,
which drew back in mo&s;t places, &s;o that in a &s;mall room, where it appears
there is nothing but the cu&s;hions, every nece&s;&s;ary is to be found. As the
vi&s;it was at an end, I curt&s;ied and &s;he bowed. In the court-yard there
was a dancer, a woman accompanied in her ge&s;|tures by a boy, but it was
impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee them either with plea&s;ure or propriety; &s;he never
lifted her feet off the ground but once in four minutes, and then only one foot
at a time, and every part of her per&s;on danced except her feet. I went to a
Mo&s;que, where &s;everal pious Mu&s;&s;ulmen were going round in a circle in
the mid&s;t of the build|ing, <PB N="230" REF="239"> groaning and &s;linging
their heads al|mo&s;t to the ground and then up again, a con&s;tant motion
which with the moving round one way &s;oon puts them into a kind of torture,
under which they fall to the ground; and then are dragged into rece&s;&s;es in
the Mo&s;que, made on purpo&s;e to receive the&s;e boly men, who &s;acrifice
&s;o many hours, and their per&s;ons to idle pain, in order to prove their
devotion to Mahomet. They frequently pronounced Allah&mdash;</P>
<P>In one of the rece&s;&s;es I &s;aw a man lying, that I was told had
been there without eating or drinking forty hours; which ab|&s;tinence is
another pious act, and if their courage is exce&s;&s;ive, and Allah can
in&s;pire them with &s;trength enough, they endeavour in getting out of the
dark and damp hole where they lay for many hours, to join in the circle, and
begin to move, but in this attempt they generally fall &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the
ground, and are carried home to recover their &s;trength. This kind of mummery
in|&s;pires the people with a great reverence and e&s;teem for tho&s;e who
practi&s;e it. I return|ed <PB N="231" REF="240"> home as much di&s;gu&s;ted
with this non|&s;en&s;e as I was di&s;plea&s;ed with the dirt of the town. The
Mo&s;que was &s;habby on the out&s;ide and gloomy within, notwith&s;tand|ing
many lamps in it. The Minaret, which we &s;hould call a &s;teeple, and all the
other Minarets I &s;aw in the town, are uncom|monly light, being very high and
narrow. A man &s;tands at the top and calls to pray|ers, in&s;tead of tolling
bells as we do, at par|ticular hours, and makes a noi&s;e to the full as
agreeable&mdash;</P>
<P>The chief traffic of this town is the lea|ther which we call
Morocco, of various co|lours, yellow, red, green, and blue; it is to be had
very cheap, and is like &s;attin. The innumerable &s;heep with which the&s;e
plains are covered furni&s;h much leather, which is a cheap commodity, as well
as the mo&s;t beautiful and co&s;tly peli&s;&s;es. The &s;heep are all
&s;potted. The lamb-&s;kins are beautiful, and they kill the ewes to have the
lamb-&s;kins before the birth; the&s;e have &s;mall &s;pots, and are &s;mooth
like the lighte&s;t and fine&s;t &s;attins. As many of the&s;e little 
<PB N="232" REF="241"> animals mu&s;t be &s;kinned to make the lin|ing of one
coat, it is no wonder this is one of the mo&s;t &s;umptuous pre&s;ents the
Empre&s;s can make to an amba&s;&s;ador. I wi&s;h I was rich enough to &s;end

<P>IN my way hither I dined at the Co&s;&s;ack Chief's po&s;t, and my
entertainment was truly Co&s;&s;ack. A long table for thirty peo|ple; at one
end a half-grown pig roa&s;ted whole; at the other a half-grown &s;heep, whole
likewi&s;e; in the middle of the table an immen&s;e tureen of curdled milk;
there were &s;everal &s;ide-di&s;hes made for me and the Ru&s;&s;ians, as well
as the cook could imagine to our ta&s;te. The old warrior would fain have made
me ta&s;te above thirty &s;orts of wine from his country, the borders of the
Don; but I contented my&s;elf with three or four, and &s;ome were very good.
After dinner from the windows, I &s;aw a fine mock battle between the
Co&s;&s;acks; and I &s;aw three Calmoucks, the uglie&s;t fierce&s;t looking men
imaginable, with <PB N="234" REF="243"> their eyes &s;et in their head,
inclining down to their no&s;e, and uncommonly &s;quare jaw|bones. The&s;e
Calmoucks are &s;o dexterous with bows and arrows that one killed a goo&s;e at
a hundred paces, and the other broke an egg at fifty. The young Co&s;&s;ack
officers tried their &s;kill with them, but they were perfectly novices in
compari&s;on to them; they &s;ung and danced, but their &s;teps and their tones
were equally in&s;ipid, void of grace and harmony.</P>
<P>When a Co&s;&s;ack is &s;ick he drinks &s;our milk for a few days,
and that is the only remedy the Co&s;&s;acks have for fevers&mdash;</P>
<P>At night I lodged at a hou&s;e that had belonged to a noble Tartar,
where there is a Ru&s;&s;ian po&s;t, with about twelve hundred of the fine&s;t
men I ever &s;aw, and uncom|monly tall. A Tartarian hou&s;e has always another
building at a little di&s;tance from it for the convenience of travellers or
&s;trangers, whom the noble Tartar always treats with the greate&s;t
ho&s;pitality; here the General parted from us. I proceeded in the Go|vernor's 
<PB N="235" REF="244"> carriage with him thus far, the re&s;t of our company
went to &s;ee Kaffa or The|odo&s;ia. I go to meet them to-morrow, at a place
called Mangou&s;s. We had only two Co&s;&s;acks with us, as the General, to
plea&s;e the Tartars, never is e&s;corted by a military party. Batche&s;crai is
&s;ituated in &s;o &s;teep a valley, that &s;ome of the hanging pieces of rock
&s;eem ready to fall and cru&s;h the hou&s;es. About a mile from the town on
the left, I &s;aw a troop of well-dre&s;&s;ed Tartars, there were above a
hundred on hor&s;eback; the Kaima-Kan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That word means
the Khan's fir&s;t mini&s;ter&mdash;a per&s;on called him cream of
Tartar&mdash;which I fearing he &s;hould be told of, turned into the cream of
the Tartars&mdash;which he &s;aid was no wonder; as he was &s;o&mdash;</NOTE>
was at the head of this company, who were come out to meet and e&s;cort us, but
I who did not know this, a&s;ked the Governor if there was a Ru&s;&s;ian po&s;t
here; which there is above the town, of a thou&s;and men. There are five
thou&s;and Tartar inhabitants here; I do not believe there was a man left in
his hou&s;e, the &s;treets being lined with Tartarian men on each &s;ide; their
countenances were very <PB N="236" REF="245"> &s;ingular, mo&s;t of them kept
their eyes fixed on the ground, as we pa&s;&s;ed; but &s;ome ju&s;t looked up,
and, as if they were afraid of &s;eeing a woman's face uncovered, ha&s;tily
ca&s;t their eyes downward again; &s;ome diverted at the novelty, looked and
laughed very much&mdash;There is a great trade here of blades for &s;words,
hangers, and knives&mdash;I am a&s;&s;ured many made here are not to be
di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of Dama&s;cus&mdash;</P>
<P>The Khan's palace is an irregular build|ing, the greate&s;t part of
it is one floor rai&s;ed upon pillars of wood painted and gilt in a fanciful
and lively manner, the arch, or la&s;t door-way, has fine proportions, a large
in|&s;cription in gilt letters is the chief ornament&mdash;I am told it was
perfectly in ruins, but the governor has had it repaired, new gilt, and painted
for the Empre&s;s's reception. Court within court, and garden within gar|den,
make a variety of apartments where the Khan walked from his own re&s;idence to
the Harem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harem means that apartment where the women
re&s;ide; which is always a &s;eparate building from that which the ma|&s;ter
inhabits&mdash;and &s;i&s;ters, mothers, wives, or mi&s;tre&s;&s;es all inhabit
the Harem&mdash;</NOTE>, which is &s;pacious and higher <PB N="237" REF="246">
than the other buildings. What I thought pretty enough was that &s;everal of
the &s;quare places under his apartment were paved with marble, and have in the
center fountains which play con&s;tantly. My room is a &s;quare of more than
forty feet, having two rows of windows one above the other on three &s;ides,
and it was with diffi|culty I found a place to have my bed put up in&mdash;</P>
<P>I never &s;aw &s;uch a variety of colours&mdash;different coloured
gold and &s;ilver mixed to|gether. The Kaima-Kan, and two other principal
Tartars, &s;upped with us, and I find nothing can exceed the ignorance and
&s;implicity of the&s;e people. The Kaima-Kan is the Khan's fir&s;t mini&s;ter;
he is total|ly ignorant of the geography of his own country; and &s;ays that
England and Peter|&s;burgh are the &s;ame thing; I am to dine with his
&s;i&s;ter to-morrow; &s;he is married to a rich Tartar, who has given a
certain yearly &s;um to po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;olely, the profits of the &s;oap
mines. For among the excellent productions of this penin&s;ula, there is a mine
of earth exactly like &s;oap, and reckoned <PB N="238" REF="247"> very good for
the &s;kin; the Turki&s;h wo|men con&s;ume a great quantity of it at
Con|&s;tantinople; and I am told this Tartar makes an immen&s;e income from it.
I &s;aw from the windows a kind of dome which rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity, and I am
told it is a monument built to the memory of a Chri&s;|tian wife, which the
Khan loved &s;o tender|ly that he was incon&s;olable for her lo&s;s; and that
he had placed it there, that he might have the &s;atisfaction of looking at the
building which contained her remains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many buildings

<P>THE la&s;t time I wrote I was at Batche|&s;erai, &s;ince which I
have been at another Ru&s;&s;ian po&s;t, at the place where the ancient town of
Krim &s;tood, of which there is not a ve&s;tige left. A General Schlikt
commands a fine regiment of Ru&s;&s;ian cavalry there, and lodges in an outer
building belonging to a good hou&s;e prepared for the Empre&s;s. This general
fought very valiantly in the Poli&s;h Confederacy again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians,
and his bravery induced the Empre&s;s to take him into her &s;ervice. He
&s;hewed me among his hor&s;es a fine che&s;tnut or rather gold-coloured
Arabian, &s;o beautiful an ani|mal I never before &s;aw. I mu&s;t not forget to
tell you that I went, as I told you I &s;hould, to dine with the Kaima-Kan's
&s;i&s;ter, who&s;e harem, with her hu&s;band's hou&s;e, <PB N="241" REF="250">
is &s;ituated in a very romantic manner at the foot of &s;ome very
extraordinary rocks, from which i&s;&s;ue many clear &s;prings, that &s;upply
the hou&s;es and her bath with perpe|tual fre&s;h water; there is a &s;trange
ap|pearance on the &s;ummit of tho&s;e rocks, places where immen&s;e cables
have certainly pa&s;&s;ed and been tied. The Tartarians in|&s;i&s;t upon it
that the &s;ea once lay at the foot of them; and &s;hips were fa&s;tened to
them. We dined in the hu&s;band's apartment, a very dirty &s;habby place for
&s;o rich a gentle|man&mdash;Tartarian cookery con&s;i&s;ts in much grea&s;e
and honey; after dinner, the Kaima-Kan walked acro&s;s a yard, and I was bid to
follow. I did &s;o into another court, where four women and &s;ome young girls
met us, and la&s;t of all his &s;i&s;ter. Her dre&s;s was magnificent,
particularly her girdle, in the front of which were two circles like bracelet
lockets; the centers of them contained two fine emeralds. She offered me a
large gob|let which held two quarts of &s;herbet, an in|different kind of
lemonade; after that coffee, and la&s;t of all &s;weetmeats. We conver&s;ed
very well by &s;igns, &s;he was neither old nor <PB N="242" REF="251"> ugly,
but how is it po&s;&s;ible to judge of a countenance hid under bad painting,
and eyebrows which join into one &s;traight line drawn acro&s;s the no&s;e? My
gloves gave her the &s;ame unea&s;y appearance I had &s;een in the other
Tartarian woman, &s;o I pulled them off, but &s;he was not &s;o curious as the
other, and it &s;eemed to be a high entertain|ment to her brother to &s;ee us
conver&s;e by &s;igns. I wore a <HI>chemi&s;e</HI> with two rows of very fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e lace at the bo&s;om, which I thought
would &s;urpri&s;e her, but lace, and every magnificence which is not gold,
&s;ilver, pearls, or diamonds, I am told pa&s;&s;es unnoticed&mdash;Linen is
not much in u&s;e; their &s;hifts, and the &s;hirts of the men, are generally
made of very thin &s;ilk, or &s;ilk mixed with cotton, which is &s;eldom
changed; but the very &s;requent u&s;e of baths makes this cu&s;tom le&s;s
loath&s;ome than it would otherwi&s;e be, When &s;he had quitted the harem, her
bro|ther &s;taid behind a little, and afterwards came up to me, ki&s;&s;ed the
bottom of my gown, and pre&s;ented me a very beautiful handkerchief of his
&s;i&s;ter's embroidery, which the governor told me I mu&s;t accept; 
<PB N="243" REF="252"> I de&s;ired the Kaima-Kan to thank her, and tell her I
would keep it for her &s;ake; it is of mu&s;lin, the borders embroidered with
different coloured &s;ilks and gold, and what I cannot comprehend, both &s;ides
are the &s;ame&mdash;</P>
<P>I have been at Soudak, where the foun|dations yet remain of a very
large town, which was rebuilt by the Genoe&s;e, on the de&s;cent of &s;teep
rocks. When you get to the &s;ummit of the&s;e you look down to the &s;ea, and
there are the remains of a chapel, where a granite pillar is &s;o placed that
the fir&s;t &s;hake it receives it mu&s;t fall perpendicu|larly into it This
town mu&s;t have been in|acce&s;&s;ible to a fleet, and from the po&s;ition of
the fortifications and out-po&s;ts, of which there are remains, mu&s;t have
been ex|tremely well defended from the inhabitants of the interior part of the
country&mdash;</P>
<P>To the left of the town there is a fine harbour; it is upon this
&s;outhern part of the penin&s;ula that vines are cultivated, and grow wild in
great abundance; at pre&s;ent only a few private people there have vine|yards 
<PB N="244" REF="253"> of their own. There is little good wine made, and the
Empre&s;s has indeed a Frenchman, who &s;eems to care only about the &s;trength
of the wine being &s;ufficient to make brandy, which he di&s;tils in great
quantities. He is &s;ettled at Soudak at pre|&s;ent, and probably will make a
great for|tune, but not teach the culture of vines to the Ru&s;&s;ians. From
Soudak I went to Atchmetchet, the re&s;idence of the gover|nor; it is prettily
&s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground, not far from the valley which borders the
river Salguir; and the &s;oil on the borders of this river is exactly like the
black mould of our kitchen gardens, and extremely fer|tile. The governor's
hou&s;e is comfortable, and the barracks with the other buildings erected by
the Ru&s;&s;ians make a good ap|pearance; I &s;aw &s;ome people cour&s;ing with
Tartarian greyhounds, which are remarka|bly tall, and reckoned very good. The
go|vernor &s;hewed me likewi&s;e a pretty collec|tion of &s;tuffed birds, and
other pre&s;ervati|ons; with &s;tones, minerals, the produce of the Crimea; but
the fine turf, the excel|lent &s;oil, the orchards, the climate, are 
<PB N="245" REF="254"> &s;ufficient inducements to be partial to this country.
One very particular thing I took notice of was a &s;mall pink flower, that
&s;pread like net-work over the turf&mdash;and, a&s;king what it was, found
they were peach|trees, which when very young, being nip|ped by the &s;heep,
grow into little bu&s;hes&mdash;I was really &s;orry to quit the governor;
grave, &s;teady, and cold in his manner, there was a dignity in it which made
his extreme attention and re&s;pect for me the more acceptable, nor can I &s;ay
that he for|got any thing that could make me take a true impre&s;&s;ion of the
country, or a favour|able one of the Ru&s;&s;ian officers, who have given me
&s;everal maps, and every infor|mation I dould de&s;ire&mdash;I wi&s;h it may
ever be in my power to &s;hew him in my country any marks of the &s;en&s;e! I
have of his goodne&s;s&mdash;I have promi&s;ed to take a barrel of wine
belonging to Mr. de Bullako&s;, the Ru&s;&s;ian Mini&s;ter at the
Porte&mdash;and a root of hor&s;e-radi&s;h from him&mdash;</P>
<P>I find a thirty-&s;ix gun frigate, under the di&s;gui&s;e of a
merchant-&s;hip, had been fitted <PB N="246" REF="255"> out for me, and had
been ready above a fortnight; the governor accompanied me to this place, which
the de&s;cription of would be too long for this letter, &s;o I &s;hall take my
leave of you for the pre&s;ent, only ob&s;erving that I have a whole hou&s;e to
my|&s;elf, where the architecture and furniture are Engli&s;h; it belonged to
an Admiral Mackenzie, who is ju&s;t dead&mdash;I cro&s;&s;ed an arm of the
&s;ea in the Comte de Wynowitch's barge to arrive here&mdash;and upon landing,
at the bottom of a flight of &s;everal &s;teps, I was &s;urpri&s;ed by two or
three voices, who &s;aid. we are your countrymen, my Lady&mdash;and in fact,
there are &s;everal of my country|men as captains or lieutenants in this navy.

<P>I Should be very glad you could &s;ee this place&mdash;From the

con&s;iderable and extraordinary town; at pre&s;ent the only remains of it are
rooms hewn out of the rock. Here is a large chapel, the pillars and altars of
which are extremely curious; the &s;tone is whiti&s;h, and not unlike marble. I
climbed up a &s;tair-ca&s;e, and crept into and out of very extraordinary

co&s;t me not a little trouble in turning and climbing up &s;o high, I had no

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;et out the day before ye&s;terday to &s;ee a mo&s;t beautiful
valley called Baydar, but when we had gone a con&s;iderable way acro&s;s the
mountains in carriages, the Comte de Wynowitch told me that we were
five-and-twenty miles from the place we were going to, and that we mu&s;t take
the Co&s;&s;ack hor&s;es, of which we had five with us, and ride them. As I was
not appri&s;ed of this, I had not brought my &s;ide-&s;addle with me. I told
him it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to ride a&s;tride, and the Co&s;&s;ack
&s;addles I could not &s;it upon, &s;o we returned back to Seva&s;topole. We
&s;et out again ye&s;ter|day for the valley of Baydar, and at the &s;ame place
where we had left the carriages the day before, I had my &s;ide-&s;addle put 
<PB N="252" REF="261"> upon the talle&s;t of the Co&s;&s;ack hor&s;es, and
after going about twelve miles among the mo&s;t beautiful mountains imaginable,
a &s;mall valley appeared a little to the right of us infinitely pretty. We
cro&s;&s;ed that and went through a thick wood, which led to the valley of
Baydar; a mo&s;t enchanting and magnificent &s;pot, intended by nature for
&s;ome indu&s;trious and happy nation to enjoy in peace. A few Tartar villages
le&s;&s;en the wildne&s;s of the &s;cene, but, in &s;uch a place, the meadow
part &s;hould be covered with herds, and the mountainous with &s;heep. When we
were come into this valley we found the mountains to the left le&s;s high, and
le&s;s rocky than tho&s;e to the right, which run in a line with tho&s;e to
Soudak, and form the coa&s;t. When we were in the valley we could not have
ima|gined that we were &s;o near the &s;ea; as the rocks which are above it are
covered with wood of every &s;ort, wild vine, pomegranate, and many &s;weet
&s;hrubs; I rode up to an elevation, which is, for as much as I can gue&s;s,
the centre of the valley, and &s;at there <PB N="253" REF="262"> with my
companions contemplating the beautiful &s;cene. The valley is above twenty
miles long, wide enough to form it into a graceful oval&mdash;two or three
&s;mall rivers run through it, and there are fine clear &s;prings in every
village. The Albanian Colonel, who had been pre&s;ented to me at
Kara&s;|ba&s;ar, met us with his &s;on; and I &s;hall ne|ver forget their
appearance. When they heard us coming they got off their hor&s;es. I &s;aw the
&s;on fir&s;t, a tall lad about thirteen years old, in a kind of Roman
warrior's dre&s;s, with rows of gold like armour all down the fore part of the
ve&s;t&mdash;He had a helmet on&mdash;As I was not appri&s;ed of this, I had no
idea what the vi&s;ion was that pre|&s;ented it&s;elf, till I &s;aw the father.
They were both leading their hor&s;es, and came to me to in&s;i&s;t on my
dining at Balaklava, on my way home, which I did; and if I had not been obliged
to quit this country in a &s;hip, I &s;hould certainly have bribed my
Co&s;&s;ack to have &s;old his hor&s;e to me; the animal was &s;o excellent a
galloper that I was obliged &s;everal times to &s;top till the re&s;t of the
company came up&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="263"> The Co&s;&s;acks, Sir, are extremely proud of
their hor&s;es, as they &s;ay &s;ince your im|mortal uncle the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia fir&s;t rode one, he never has, in time of war, made u&s;e of any
other than a hor&s;e from the borders of the Don. I do not know who was mo&s;t
plea&s;ed, the Co&s;&s;ack that lent me his hor&s;e, or I who rode him. We
turned to the left to go to the Colonel's hou&s;e, and winding round &s;ome
beautiful rocks, the de&s;cent of which was gentle, we &s;aw before us the
harbour of Balaklava. The Albani|an Chief had ranged his regiment in one
&s;traight line, at the foot of the rocks to the left facing the &s;ea, on the
edge of which his hou&s;e &s;tood. I can conceive nothing &s;o &s;in|gular to a
regular corps as the &s;ight of an Albanian troop; they had firelocks of every
country; each man is at liberty to dre&s;s and arm him&s;elf as he plea&s;es.
Oriental and Italian poniards, with the odde&s;t pi&s;tols in the world were
&s;tuck in their girdles; &s;ome had hats, others caps, and helmets upon their
heads. Gregorio Chapone, the colonel, de&s;ired I might be told they were 
<PB N="255" REF="264"> alert, &s;pirited, and brave; his po&s;t indeed was of
infinite con&s;equence, and he was placed there on that account; opinions were
unanimous concerning his military re|putation. The Albanians wear &s;hort
jack|ets, with two, three, or four rows of filla|gree buttons, an ornament they
like much, and I thought them pretty. The Colonel's wife and &s;everal other
women received me at the door, and we conver&s;ed by interpre|ters. There were
&s;everal Turki&s;h boats in the harbour, but there was a line on the &s;hore
marked with fires which they were not permitted to pa&s;s. The Turks came to
&s;ell oranges, and every precaution is taken to prevent their communicating
the plague; &s;o that although they may come on &s;hore, they are obliged to
heap their oranges with|in the &s;pace allotted to them, and bargain at a
di&s;tance. We were above thirty people at table, and I returned with my
company to Seva&s;topole in carriages. I called ju&s;t now the Turki&s;h
ve&s;&s;els boats, but I am told they are &s;hips; a mo&s;t dangerous &s;ort of
conveyance for men or merchandi&s;e in <PB N="256" REF="265"> my opinion, long,
narrow, and top-heavy. The frigate prepared for me &s;eems a good &s;hip; the
three &s;ea-officers who go with me, have never been at Con&s;tantinople; we go
as merchants, for by a treaty be|tween the Forte and Ru&s;&s;ia, trading
ve&s;&s;els may come from the Black Sea into the Canal of Con&s;tantinople, but
not men of war. We have a Greek pilot on board, who is to &s;teer us &s;afe,
plea&s;e Heaven. I am told we are not to be much more than two days in our
pa&s;&s;age; but I have told my company I expect to be &s;even. Why I have
cho&s;en the number &s;even I cannot gue&s;s; but I can give no other rea&s;on
to you than that I have long re&s;olved in my mind to expect a triple do&s;e of
any bitter draught I am obliged to &s;wallow; and I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, in
this method of calculating events, I &s;hall not be &s;o often di&s;appointed

<OPENER><DATELINE>PALAIS DE FRANCE, PERA, 
<DATE>April 20, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am &s;afely arrived, dear Sir, and ha&s;ten to inform you how I
made my voyage. I &s;et out the 13th at five in the morning; Mr. de Wynowitch
took me out of the harbour in a &s;mall frigate, and after &s;eeing me &s;afe
in my cabbin took leave. I gave him many thanks for the attentions he had paid
me, and wi&s;hed him an opportunity of &s;ignalizing his courage at &s;ea,
which &s;eemed to be the thing he had mo&s;t at heart. He gave me a royal
&s;alute, and as his guns fired, we &s;et &s;ail with a fair wind; we had not
been two days at &s;ea before we were becalmed; and we lay three days and three
nights, wi&s;hing for wind, which came on at la&s;t very fre&s;h with rain. It
was a &s;ide-wind, the rain prevented us from &s;eeing the Turki&s;h &s;hore
&s;ometimes, and &s;ometimes <PB N="260" REF="269"> we could &s;ee it very
di&s;tinctly; but we ran thus four-and-twenty hours to the left, without
&s;eeing the objects that precede the entrance of the Canal. On the &s;eventh
day, the Greek pilot, the only per&s;on on board who had ever been at
Con&s;tantino|ple, was dead drunk and incapable of &s;peak|ing, much le&s;s of
&s;teering the &s;hip. The officers were greatly alarmed, and there was a long
con&s;ultation between them and the re&s;t of the company. I luckily had a
&s;mall map of the Black Sea, and the entrance of the Canal, which alone was
our guide. As to me I had dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in a riding habit, and had a
&s;mall box in one hand, an um|brella in the other, and had told the cap|tain I
was determined to get into the boat and land on the Turki&s;h &s;hore, rather
than lo&s;e &s;ight of the Canal, or &s;ail into it with|out being quite &s;ure
that we were right. There is a large rock on the European &s;hore, which is
&s;o far di&s;tant from it that, unle&s;s a map or pilot directs the mariner,
he mu&s;t infallibly take it for the entrance of the Bo&s;phorus, and &s;everal
hundreds of Turk|i&s;h boats are wrecked upon it yearly.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="270"> The gentlemen and officers &s;tood all the
morning upon deck, watching the &s;hore; we had ran then above ninety leagues
to the left, always &s;eeing land, which was owing to the currents which had
taken our &s;hip during the three days calm, &s;o much more to the right. As to
me I &s;tood be|tween decks, till the Captain told me to come and look at a
village, church, or &s;omething. It was a Turki&s;h Minaret, and a few moments
afterward we &s;aw that rock I dreaded &s;o much, upon which there are about a
thou&s;and Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;els that pe|ri&s;h con&s;tantly every year, as the
Turks for|get as they leave it to the left in coming out, they mu&s;t leave it
to the right in going in. Perhaps they are like an Iri&s;h acquaint|ance of
mine, who going up a very &s;teep hill in a carriage to pay a vi&s;it, could
never be made to under&s;tand that he was to go down the hill in returning; the
only argu|ment he made u&s;e of was, that as the road was the &s;ame, he mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily go up the hill, having done &s;o, in going over that &s;ame
road&mdash;</P>
<P>To return to my voyage, Sir: you may judge how infinitely
comfortable I felt, in <PB N="262" REF="271"> being at anchor about &s;ix in
the evening; e&s;caped from all the dangers I had been threatened with upon the
Black Sea; and the ugly circum&s;tance that attended us when we were about to
take our leave of it. I had &s;o many birds, among which was a mo&s;t beautiful
milk-white &s;mall heron, that had taken refuge in the &s;hip, that my cabbin
looked like a bird-&s;hop. We &s;up|ped on board very comfortably, and I took
&s;ome hours re&s;t; and the next morning we put our&s;elves in the long-boat,
and were rowed to Mr. de Bukalow's hou&s;e at Bou|yukdere, but he was at Pera,
&s;o we were rowed by a Turki&s;h boat down to Pera. The Bo&s;phorus takes a
&s;udden turn at Bou|yukdere&mdash;I refer you to Mr. Gibbon, Sir, for his
account of the &s;ingular &s;ituation of Con&s;tantinople, my pen will repeat
feebly what he has de&s;cribed in language maje&s;tic as the &s;ubject
de&s;erves. But I am certain no land&s;cape can amu&s;e or plea&s;e in
compa|ri&s;on with the varied view, which the bor|ders of this famed Straight
compo&s;e. Rocks, verdure, ancient ca&s;tles, built on the &s;ummit of the
hills by the Genoe&s;e&mdash;modern Kio&s;ks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kio&s;k
means a &s;ummer-hou&s;e with blinds all round.</NOTE>, <PB N="263" REF="272">
Minarets, and large platane-trees, ri&s;ing promi&s;cuous in the
vallies&mdash;large meadows&mdash;multitudes of people, and boats &s;warm|ing
on the &s;hore and on the water; and what was particular, nothing to be &s;een
like a formal French garden. The Turks have &s;o great a re&s;pect for natural
beauties, that if they mu&s;t build a hou&s;e where a tree &s;tands, they leave
a large hole for the tree to pa&s;s through and increa&s;e in &s;ize, they
think the branches of it the prettie&s;t ornament for the top of the hou&s;e;
in truth, Sir, contra&s;t a chimney to a beauti|ful foliage, and judge if they
are right or wrong. The coa&s;t is &s;o &s;afe that a large fleet of Turki&s;h
ve&s;&s;els is to be &s;een in every creek, ma&s;ts of which are intermingled
with the trees, and a graceful confu&s;ion and va|riety make this living
picture the mo&s;t poignant &s;cene I ever beheld.</P>
<P>Judge of Mr. de Bukalow's &s;urpri&s;e, when he had opened his
letters and read my name, he had &s;carcely time to offer me his &s;ervices,
when Mr. de Choi&s;eul's people came and claimed me from their ma&s;ter,

ex|tremely glad that I am to profit by his con|ver&s;ation and company, both of
which are as much to be de&s;ired as talents and polite|ne&s;s can make them.

of Venice; it &s;tands near the port, and in good pre&s;ervation. The Temple of
Augu&s;tus and Triumphal Arch, both of the Corinthian order, belonging to the
&s;ame town, are fine monuments of antiquity&mdash;Mr. Ca&s;as has taken
drawings of them. At night when we have no vi&s;itors, and all the
amba&s;&s;ador's bu&s;ine&s;s is done, he comes into my room, followed by Mr.
Ca&s;as and a few more people, with large <HI>portefeuilles</HI> full of
the&s;e mo&s;t beautiful drawings, and we pa&s;s three or four hours looking
over them, and conver&s;ing upon topics which are my &s;avourites. It is a
&s;ingular in&s;tance of good ta&s;te in a Frenchman, to have given him|&s;elf
up ten years ago to the finding and col|lecting all that is really be&s;t
worthy of re|cord, <PB N="267" REF="276"> as to the ancient architecture. Mr.
de Choi&s;eul's <HI>Voyage Pittore&s;que de la Grece,</HI> and when he was but
two-and-twenty, taking the mo&s;t perilous journeys to find out new
antiquities, if I may &s;o call them, mu&s;t endear him to all lovers of the
fine arts&mdash;but now that his judgment is formed, and that he &s;its down to
collect all his materials together, I doubt not the work he is about to
publi&s;h, which is an addition to the fir&s;t, will be the mo&s;t perfect
thing of the kind exi&s;ting. You will wonder that I do not begin this letter
by giving you a magnifi|cent account of the view from my windows; but my eyes
and ears both are &s;o much better plea&s;ed within than without doors, that I
mu&s;t fir&s;t give you an account of what pa&s;&s;es there. Mr. de Choi&s;eul,
be&s;ide being a very fine &s;cholar, is a very lively and polite man; and has
none of that kind of mo&s;t odious attention which young Frenchmen di&s;play,
thinking it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay fine things to, or admire ladies upon the
&s;lighte&s;t acquaintance; he has the dig|nity of the <HI>Vieille cour,</HI>
with the ea&s;e of modern manners; and, if I was the Em|pre&s;s 
<PB N="268" REF="277"> of Ru&s;&s;ia, he could not treat me with more
re&s;pect, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> if I was his
&s;i&s;ter with more regard. His hou&s;e is like a very fine French Hotel at
Paris, built with good &s;tone and wood, rare materials here, where every
hou&s;e is in the con&s;truction like a &s;tage, and compo&s;ed of as &s;light
materials From &s;ome of the windows I look acro&s;s that harbour called the
Golden Horn by the ancients, and from others can &s;ee the &s;ea of Marmo|ra,
the i&s;lands therein, and part of the Se|raglio&mdash;from mine I &s;aw
ye&s;terday the Sul|tan &s;itting on a &s;ilver &s;ofa, while his boats, and
many of the people who were to ac|company him, were lining the banks of the
garden. A magnificent &s;ight, as they are of a light &s;hape, gilt, and
painted very beautifully. We had a large tele&s;cope, and &s;aw the Ottoman
&s;olendour very di&s;tinctly. The Sultan dyes his beard black, to give
him&s;elf a young look&mdash;and he is known at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance by
that, which con|tra&s;ts &s;ingularly with his face, that is ex|tremely livid
and pale. The kio&s;k, which contained him and his &s;ilver &s;ofa, was not
very large, and like a hundred others to be <PB N="269" REF="278"> &s;een on
the Canal. It is &s;trange, Sir, how words gain in other countries a
&s;ignification different from the meaning they po&s;&s;e&s;s in their own.
Serail, or Seraglio, is generally under&s;tood as the habitation, or rather the
confinement of women; here it is the Sul|tan's re&s;idence; it cannot be called
his pa|lace, for the kio&s;ks, gardens, courts, walls, &s;tables, are &s;o
mixed, that it is many hou&s;es in many gardens.</P>
<P>The &s;treets both of Pera and Con&s;tanti|nople are &s;o narrow
that few of them admit of a carriage&mdash;the windows of every &s;tory project
over tho&s;e under them, &s;o that at the upper people may &s;hake hands
&s;ome|times acro&s;s the &s;treet. No Turk of any con&s;equence makes a
vi&s;it, if it is only four doors from his own, but on hor&s;eback; and, on my
arrival here, I &s;aw one who landed in a boat, and had a fine grey hor&s;e led
by four men, that went a long way round, which he mounted gravely, to get off
in a few moments.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="279"> As to women, as many, if not more than men,
are to be &s;een in the &s;treets&mdash;but they look like walking mummies. A
large loo&s;e robe of dark green cloth covers them from the neck to the ground,
over that a large piece of mu&s;lin, which wraps the &s;houlders and the arms,
another which goes over the head and eyes; judge, Sir, if all the&s;e
co|verings do not confound all &s;hape or air &s;o much, that men or women,
prince&s;&s;es and &s;laves, may be concealed under them. I think I never &s;aw
a country where women may enjoy &s;o much liberty, and free from all reproach,
as in Turkey. A Turki&s;h hu&s;band that &s;ees a pair of &s;lippers at the
door of his harem mu&s;t not enter; his re&s;|pect for the &s;ex prevents him
from intrud|ing when a &s;tranger is there upon a vi&s;it; how ea&s;y then is
it for men to vi&s;it and pa&s;s for women! If I was to walk about the
&s;treets here I would certainly wear the &s;ame dre&s;s, for the Turki&s;h
women call others names, when they meet them with their faces uncovered. When I
go out I have the Amba&s;&s;ador's &s;edan-chair, which is like mine in London,
only gilt and varni&s;hed <PB N="271" REF="280"> like a French coach, and &s;ix
Turks carry it; as they fancy it impo&s;&s;ible that two or four men can carry
one; two Jani&s;&s;aries walk before with high fur caps on. The Amba&s;&s;adors
here have all Jani&s;&s;aries as guards allowed them by the Porte. Thank Heaven
I have but a little way to go in this pomp, and fearing every moment the Turks
&s;hould fling me down they are &s;o awkward; for the platform, where people
land and embark from and to Pera is not far from this hou&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>There the Amba&s;&s;ador's boat waits for us, and we row out: boats
here are to be hired as hackney-coaches are in London, and all very beautifully
carved, mo&s;t of them with &s;ome gilding; the &s;hape of the&s;e boats is
light and beautiful, and the Turks row very well, which is a thing quite
in|compatible with the idlene&s;s vi&s;ible in all ranks of people. I &s;aw a
Turk the other day lying on cu&s;hions, &s;triking &s;lowly an iron which he
was &s;haping into an hor&s;e|&s;hoe, his pipe in his mouth all the
time&mdash;nay, among the higher order of Turks, <PB N="272" REF="281"> there
is an invention which &s;aves them the trouble of holding the pipe, two &s;mall
wheels are fixed on each &s;ide the bowl of the pipe, and thus the &s;moaker
has only to puff away, or let the pipe re&s;t upon his under lip, while he
moves his head as he plea&s;es. Perhaps, Sir, it is lucky for Europe that the
Turks are idle and ignorant; the immen&s;e power this empire might have, were
it peopled by the indu&s;trious and ambitious, would make it the mi&s;tre&s;s
of the world. At pre&s;ent it only &s;erves as a dead wall to intercept the
commerce and battles which other powers might create one another&mdash;</P>
<P>The quiet &s;tupid Turk will &s;it a whole day by the &s;ide of the
Canal, looking at flying kites or children's boats&mdash;and I &s;aw one who
was enjoying the &s;hade of an im|men&s;e platane-tree&mdash;his eyes fixed on
a kind of bottle, diverted by the noi&s;e and motion of it, while the &s;tream
kept it in con&s;tant motion. How the bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation goes on at all
I cannot gue&s;s, for the cabinet is compo&s;ed generally of ignorant
mercenaries; the Vi&s;ir was a water-carrier <PB N="273" REF="282"> to
Ha&s;&s;an Bey, the Capitan Pacha, or high|admiral. Ha&s;&s;an him&s;elf was
only a &s;er|vant at Algiers. Places are obtained at the Porte by intrigue;
each placeman, each Sultane&s;s has her creatures, and plots for placing them;
and Ver&s;ailles has not more intricate intrigue than the Porte. A rebel|lious
ba&s;haw rai&s;es troops and lives in open defiance of the &s;overeign who
inve&s;ted him with his authority. There is one at this moment, at the head of
forty thou&s;and men in Albany, who might with the greate&s;t ea&s;e make
him&s;elf king of a large country&mdash;his name is Ma&s;moud, not above thirty
years of age&mdash;and he &s;ucceeded his father in the government, which he
now holds in defiance of the Porte. Is it to be won|dered at if the Turk is a
prede&s;tinarian in mo&s;t things, &s;ince it is neither birth or abi|lities
that can give him place or power&mdash;nor is there generally any vi&s;ible
ju&s;t rea&s;on why heads are &s;truck off. There is a re|cent example here,
proving that the confi|dence of the Sultan is not the &s;ure&s;t way to
e&s;cape a &s;udden and unexpected death. One Petraki, a Greek, a kind of
banker to <PB N="274" REF="283"> the court, by his frequent acce&s;s to Achmet,
rai&s;ed the jealou&s;y of the mini&s;try, who, upon various pretences, one day
in council, de&s;ired Petraki's head might fall&mdash;</P>
<P>The Sultan, who&s;e private rea&s;ons for keeping it on, were
infinitely better than tho&s;e Petraki's enemies had alledged, was extremely
aver&s;e to &s;uch a thing; but the Capitan Pacha and his friends were bold
enough to declare, they would not &s;tir out of the council till Achmet had
&s;igned the order; which he did, with the tears &s;tream|ing down his cheeks.
Upon &s;uch occa|&s;ions, there is a per&s;on who&s;e place it is to go to the
hou&s;e of the unfortunate dead man, and examine the papers of any per&s;on who
in his life-time had dealings with the cabinet&mdash;</P>
<P>The man found &s;ome, which he &s;eal|ed up with four large &s;eals,
and de|&s;ired they might be delivered into the <PB N="275" REF="284"> Sultan's
own hands; very much alarmed at having &s;een them; for Petraki was the
pri|vate agent of the Sultan, who received the money, which Petraki &s;eemed
only to re|ceive for places which his intere&s;t pro|cured; and Petraki's
accounts were &s;o regularly kept, that the money he deli|vered, with the dates
and the places, were regi&s;tered&mdash;</P>
<P>The vile low intrigues of the mini&s;ters here are not to be
imagined. The Sultan has the highe&s;t opinion of the &s;en&s;e and courage of
the Capitan Pacha; when he quits Con&s;tantinople the Sovereign thinks his
capital in danger. But I find all ranks of people agree in his having
introduced a better police for the town than hitherto exi&s;ted. At a fire
&s;ome Jani&s;&s;aries not do|ing their duty properly, he had four of them
flung into it. <HI>Pour encourager les autres,</HI> as Voltaire has ob&s;erved
upon ano|ther occa&s;ion. He is always accompanied by a lion, who follows him
like a dog; the other day he &s;uffered him to accompany him 
<PB N="276" REF="285"> to the Divau, but the mini&s;ters were &s;o terrified
that &s;ome jumped out of the windows, one was near breaking his neck in flying
down &s;tairs, and the High Admiral and his lion were left to &s;ettle the
councils of the day to|gether&mdash;</P>
<P>I think it a lucky thing for the Am|ba&s;&s;adors that the Turks
neither pay nor receive vi&s;its.&mdash;Could any thing be &s;o terrible as the
&s;ociety of the mo&s;t ignorant and uninformed men upon earth?</P>
<P>You know, I &s;uppo&s;e, that they were always per&s;uaded it was
impo&s;&s;ible for a Ru&s;&s;ian fleet to come to Con&s;tantinople by any other
&s;ea than the Black Sea; and though the French endeavoured to prove to them by
maps, the pa&s;&s;age of their enemies to the Archipelago; till the Turki&s;h
fleet was engaged with the Ru&s;&s;ian in the Bay of Tche&s;me, no Turk would
believe the po&s;|&s;ibility of the thing&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="286"> I am told here that a Mr. Bouverie, who
de&s;ired to &s;ee Con&s;tantinople, came and looked at it from the frigate he
was in&mdash;but never landed&mdash;I really do not think he was to blame.
Con&s;tantinople, and the en|trance of the Bo&s;phorus by the &s;ea of
Mar|mora, is the mo&s;t maje&s;tic, magnificent, graceful, and lively &s;cene
the mo&s;t luxuriant imagination can de&s;ire to behold.</P>
<P>It was no wonder Con&s;tantine cho&s;e it for the &s;eat of empire.
Nature has com|po&s;ed of earth and water &s;uch a land&s;cape, that ta&s;te,
una&s;&s;i&s;ted by ambitious reflecti|ons, would naturally de&s;ire to give

<P>THE harbour called the Golden Horn, which &s;eparates Pera and
Con&s;tantinople, has a &s;ingularity I wi&s;h much to have ex|plained to me.
All the filth and rubbi&s;h of both towns are con&s;tantly flung into it;
cu&s;tom-hou&s;es, barracks, &s;tore-hou&s;es, the dock-yard, all the&s;e are
placed on the bor|ders of it; whole dunghills are &s;wept into it; no
mea&s;ures for keeping it clean are taken, no quays are formed by men; yet by
the &s;trength or variety of currents, or &s;ome other natural cau&s;e, this
port is always clean, and deep enough to admit of the en|trance of the
large&s;t merchantmen; which, like as in all the other harbours in the canal,
may be hooked on, clo&s;e to the &s;hore&mdash;This harbour grows narrower as
it meets the fre&s;h water, and ends at la&s;t in a &s;mall 
<PB N="280" REF="289"> rivulet; but where it is ju&s;t wide enough to have the
appearance of a &s;mall river, the French &s;ome time pa&s;t have dammed the
fre&s;h water up, making of it &s;quare pieces of water, to imitate tho&s;e of
Marly. Here kio&s;ks and trees have been placed in great regularity, and it is
here that on a Friday Turks in groupes are to be &s;een dining, taking coffee,
or &s;moaking upon carpets, &s;pread under the &s;hade of the immen&s;e and
lofty platane. I can give you no other idea of the &s;ize of &s;ome of the&s;e
beautiful trees, but by telling you it corre&s;ponds to the gigantic
land&s;cape of which they make the fine&s;t ornament; yes, my dear Sir, the
large&s;t oaks you can have &s;een would look, &s;et down by the&s;e, as little
broom&s;ticks. Women in groupes likewi&s;e, apart from the men, meet here; but
when they come to the&s;e places, of which there are a great number near
Con&s;tantinople, they hire what they imagine to be coaches, called
<HI>arabats</HI>&mdash;A vile machine like a covered cart, with rows of benches
in the in&s;ide There are no &s;prings to them; and one day in a valley called
<HI>l' Echelle du grand Seigneur,</HI> I <PB N="281" REF="290"> got into one,
but cho&s;e rather to get out and walk &s;ix miles, than be jolted
unmer|cifully. All the Amba&s;&s;adors &s;ince my arrival here have given balls
and dinners. Madame d'Herbert, the Imperial Mini&s;ter's wife, is lively, and I
&s;ee her often. The Dutch Amba&s;&s;ador's wife is a very good woman; and I am
very comfortable, think|ing people extremely good to me to an&s;wer the million
of que&s;tions I a&s;k. There is but one per&s;on here to whom I never ap|ply

<P><PB N="282" REF="291"> By the by, Sir, I forgot to tell you I found
Sir Richard Wor&s;ley here, who has travelled much, with a per&s;on to take

knife handles&mdash;and I obtained for him a permi&s;&s;ion to go in the

<P>I am told there is an Engli&s;h merchant here extremely offended at
my loding <HI>au Palais de France,</HI> and &s;ays, if Sir R. Ain&s;tie's

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would &s;eem that every thing in nature which has remarkable
advantages, has like|wi&s;e &s;ome misfortunes attending it that counterbalance
the good, &s;o as to reduce the portion of happine&s;s to a level for man|kind.
This beautiful enchanting country, the climate, the objects, the &s;ituation of
it, make it an earthly Paradi&s;e; but the plague&mdash;but
earthquakes&mdash;what terrifying &s;ub|jects, to make the thinking part fly it
for ever. If things and per&s;ons may be compa|red, it is not a beautiful
woman, who is hand&s;omer than mo&s;t of her &s;ex, with ac|compli&s;hments
equal to her beauty; but whom the world, her very inmates envy tho&s;e
advantages&mdash;and might not the ba&s;e <PB N="285" REF="294"> pa&s;&s;ions
that &s;urround her frighten her greate&s;t admirers from tru&s;ting to her
be|witching charms&mdash;</P>
<P>I was led to this compari&s;on by talking about the Grecian
I&s;lands, which I mean to vi&s;it&mdash;they are all I am told volcanos;
&s;ome of them have di&s;appeared; and tho&s;e who have furni&s;hed Greece with
their men of greate&s;t genius, only like them, are to be found in books; and
by an adventure which happened to us ye&s;terday, as we em|barked at Tophana.
There are &s;mall plat|forms of wood fixed on to the edge of the water, where
people leave or take boats. As we arrived a boat full of Turks landed with a
corp&s;e, &s;eemingly in great ha&s;te, and as they pa&s;&s;ed, touched Mon&s;
de Choi|&s;eul and me. He &s;tarted, and I a&s;ked him what was the
matter&mdash;He told me he was &s;ure it was a man dead of the plague; and in
truth it was &s;o. Judge how di&s;agreeable to one who had not been out for
&s;ix months&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="295"> I have been to &s;ee the Mo&s;que of St.
So|phia, with two others. The dome of St. Sophia is extremely large, and well
worth &s;eeing, but &s;ome of the fine&s;t pillars are &s;et top&s;y-turvy, or
have capitals of Turki&s;h architecture. In the&s;e holy temples neither the
beautiful &s;tatues belonging to Pagan times, nor the co&s;tly ornaments of
modern Rome, are to be &s;een: &s;ome &s;habby lamps, hung irregularly, are the
only expence the Mahometans permit them&s;elves, as a proof of their re&s;pect
for the Deity or his Prophet. I went and &s;at &s;ome time up &s;tairs, to look
down into the body of the temple&mdash;I &s;aw &s;everal Turks and women
kneeling, and &s;eemingly praying with great devotion. Mo&s;ques are
con&s;tantly open; and I could not help reflecting that their mode of
wor|&s;hip is extremely convenient for the carry|ing on a plot of any &s;ort. A
figure, wrap|ped up like a mummy, can ea&s;ily kneel down by another without
being &s;u&s;pected, and mutter in a whi&s;per any &s;ort of thing; the longer
the conver&s;ation la&s;ts the more edified a &s;ilent ob&s;erver may be. No
par|ticular hour for divine &s;ervice, or per&s;on to <PB N="287" REF="296">
officiate, is appointed. It is true, that at certain hours of the day men are
&s;een on the minarets or &s;teeples, bawling and hal|looing to all good
Mu&s;&s;ulmen, that it is the hour appointed for prayer; but they follow their
own convenience or devout humour, and &s;ay their prayers not only when but
where they choo&s;e&mdash;for I have &s;een &s;everal Turks, in the mo&s;t
public and noi&s;y places about Con&s;tantinople, kneeling and praying, without
being the lea&s;t deranged or di&s;turb|ed by the variety of objects or
noi&s;es that &s;urrounded or pa&s;&s;ed by them. In order to procure me a
&s;ight of the Mo&s;ques, the Amba&s;&s;ador was obliged to apply for a
permi&s;&s;ion; the Porte graciou&s;ly gave one; in which I had leave to &s;ee
&s;eventy-five. The burial places for the dead are very nu|merous, and in a
manner &s;urround Con|&s;tantinople and Pera, forming very &s;hady romantic
walks, as the trees and grave-&s;tones are huddled together in a confu&s;ed
manner; both pre&s;enting great variety to tho&s;e who ramble among them. Each
grave-&s;tone is crowned with a turban, the form of which &s;hews the
employment or <PB N="288" REF="297"> quality of the corp&s;e when
living&mdash;I &s;hall &s;end you a drawing that will give you &s;ome idea of
them&mdash;</P>
<P>I can give you no ju&s;t idea of the beauty of the trees; which,
particularly in the&s;e burial places, are never touched, therefore &s;pread
and grow in the mo&s;t luxuriant and graceful di&s;order. There are no bounds
&s;et, or fences to re&s;train or de&s;ign the form of the&s;e burial places,
&s;ome extend a mile or two; and, if it was not for one di&s;agreeable
reflexion, would be as plea&s;ant to a foreign|er as to a Turk; but when we
con&s;ider that it is pe&s;tiferated earth we tread on; that every new made
grave may contain a body rotting with the plague, and the &s;light man|ner in
which it is covered with earth, from the hurry with which it is thrown in, we
cannot with rea&s;on &s;tay therein. Turks are prede&s;tinarians, and therefore
imagine it is fate, and not the care which is taken in Chri&s;tian hou&s;es
that prevents them from dying of this horrid di&s;order; therefore walk
unconcerned, under the dangerous &s;hade of the trees that hang over their
decea&s;ed neighbours&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="298"> Con&s;tantinople is almo&s;t &s;urrounded by
a very high wall, turreted and flanked by large &s;quare towers, built by the
Greek Emperors&mdash;the &s;tyle of architecture exactly like that of Warwick
and Berkeley Ca&s;tle; but many of the &s;quare towers, which &s;erve as
gateways, are mouldering away under the negligence of the Turks; mo&s;t of whom
believe in an ancient prophecy, which announces that the time is near when the
Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia is to make her public and triumphal entry through one
of the&s;e towers, as Empre&s;s of Greece, into Con|&s;tantinople. Many have
made up their minds, and taken their mea&s;ures to tran&s;port them&s;elves
acro&s;s the Bo&s;phorus into A&s;ia; nay, &s;ome go &s;o far as to point to
the very identical gateway through which &s;he is to proceed. To &s;ome nations
it would be very agreeable that the Turki&s;h empire was to be driven from a
&s;ituation, which &s;eems by nature formed as an univer&s;al pa&s;&s;age for
trading nations, which the inactivity of the Turks has too long ob&s;tructed.
And it is to be wi&s;hed by all tho&s;e who bear any re&s;|pect to the be&s;t
monuments of &s;culpture, <PB N="290" REF="299"> that Athens, and all it yet
contains, might not by Mahometan ignorance be entirely de&s;troyed: at
pre&s;ent, ruins, that would adorn a virtuo&s;o's cabinet, are daily burnt into
lime by the Turks; and pieces of ex|qui&s;ite workman&s;hip &s;tuck into a wall
or fountain. There remains but a very little of that pillar that once probably
was a fine ornament to the Atmeidan, or market for hor&s;es.</P>
<P>I have &s;een likewi&s;e the Sultan go in ce|remony to
prayers&mdash;from the gate of the Seraglio to the door of the
Mo&s;que&mdash;it was but a few paces. He was preceded by a double row of
Jani&s;&s;aries, to the amount of about an hundred and fifty, with other
at|tendants; he was mounted on a grey hor&s;e led by two per&s;ons, and
followed by his &s;on, a &s;ickly looking child, &s;itting on a milk-white
hor&s;e; over his head was held a green umbrella, the ribs of which were &s;et
with diamonds. You mu&s;t know diamonds are the things which the Turks are
mo&s;t fond of. While the Porte delays erecting batteries upon the mo&s;t
important po&s;ts, under the <PB N="291" REF="300"> pretence of wanting money
to pay for the pieces and work nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the empire, the
jewellers cannot find diamonds enough to &s;upply the demands of the Harem, for
which they are paid ready money. It is the quantity, and not the quality of
this &s;tone, which they prize: &s;carcely any other than ro&s;e diamonds are
to be &s;een here&mdash;</P>
<P>I have been with a large party to &s;ee the Captain Pacha's wife,
but as this letter will not contain an account of this curious vi&s;it, I

<DATE>May 7, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONSIEUR de Choi&s;eul propo&s;ed to the Amba&s;&s;adors wives and
me to go and &s;ee the Capitan Pacha's country &s;eat; accord|ingly we &s;et
out with &s;everal carriages, and about a league from Con&s;tantinople,
to|wards Romelia, we arrived there: The hou&s;e and plantations about it are
new and irregular. The Amba&s;&s;adors and the re&s;t of the male party were
&s;uffered to walk in the garden; but the Mini&s;ter's wives and my&s;elf were
&s;hewn into a &s;eparate building from the hou&s;e, where the ground floor was
made to contain a great quantity of water, and looked like a large clean
ci&s;tern. We then were led up &s;tairs, and upon the land|ing-place, which was
circular, the doors of <PB N="293" REF="302"> &s;everal rooms were open. In
&s;ome there was nothing to be &s;een, in others two or three women &s;itting
clo&s;e together; in one, a pretty young woman, with a great quan|tity of
jewels on her turban, was &s;itting al|mo&s;t in the lap of a frightful negro
woman; we were told &s;he was the Capitan Pacha's &s;i&s;ter-in-law; &s;he
looked at us with much &s;urpri&s;e; and at la&s;t, with great fear, threw
her&s;elf into the arms of the Black woman, as if to hide her&s;elf. We were
called away into a larger room than any we had &s;een, where the Capitan
Pacha's wife, a middle|aged woman, dre&s;&s;ed with great magnifi|cence,
received us with much politene&s;s; many women were with her, and &s;he had by
her a little girl, dre&s;&s;ed as magnificently as her&s;elf, her adopted
child. She made an excu&s;e for not receiving us at the door, as &s;he was
dining with her hu&s;band when we arrived. Coffee, &s;herbet, and &s;weetmeats
were offered, and we ha&s;tened to take our leave, as our cavaliers were
cooling their heels in the garden.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="303"> You can conceive nothing &s;o neat and clean
to all appearance as the interior of this Harem; the floors and pa&s;&s;ages
are cover|ed with matting of a clo&s;e and &s;trong kind; the colour of the
&s;traw or reeds with which they are made is a pale &s;traw. The rooms had no
other furniture than the cu&s;hions, which lined the whole room, and tho&s;e,
with the curtains, were of white linen. As the Turks never come into the room,
either men or women, with the &s;lippers they walk abroad with there is not a
&s;peck of &s;and or dirt within doors. I am <HI>femmelette</HI> enough to have
taken particular notice of the dre&s;s, which, if female envy did not &s;poil
every thing in the world of women, would be graceful. It con&s;i&s;ts of a
petticoat and ve&s;t, over which is worn a robe with &s;hort &s;leeves; the one
belonging to the lady of the hou&s;e was of &s;attin, embroidered richly with
the fine&s;t colours, gold and diamonds&mdash;A girdle under that, with two
circles of jewels in front, and from this gir|dle hangs an embroidered
handkerchief&mdash;A turban with a profu&s;ion of diamonds and pearls, &s;eemed
to weigh this lady's head <PB N="295" REF="304"> down; but what &s;poiled the
whole was a piece of ermine, that probably was origi|nally only a cape, but
each woman increa|&s;ing the &s;ize of it, in order to be more mag|nificent
than her neighbour, they now have it like a great &s;quare plai&s;ter that
comes down to the hips; and the&s;e &s;imple igno|rant beings do not &s;ee that
it disfigures the <HI>tout en&s;emble</HI> of a beautiful dre&s;s. The hair is
&s;eparated in many &s;mall braids hang|ing down the back, or tied up to the
point of the turban on the out&s;ide. I have no doubt but that nature intended
&s;ome of the&s;e women to be very hand&s;ome, but white and red ill applied,
their eye-brows hid under one or two black lines&mdash;teeth black by
&s;moaking, and an univer&s;al &s;toop in the &s;houlders, made them appear
rather di&s;gu&s;ting than hand&s;ome. The la&s;t defect is cau&s;ed by the
po&s;ture they &s;it in, which is that of a taylor, from their
infancy&mdash;</P>
<P>The black powder with which they line their eyelids gives their eyes
likewi&s;e a har&s;h expre&s;&s;ion. Their que&s;tions are as &s;imple as their
dre&s;s is &s;tudied&mdash;Are you marri|ed? <PB N="296" REF="305"> Have you
children? Have you no di&s;order? Do you like Con&s;tantinople? The Turki&s;h
women pa&s;s mo&s;t of their time in the bath or upon their dre&s;s; &s;trange
pa&s;times! The fir&s;t &s;poils their per&s;ons, the la&s;t disfigures them.
The frequent u&s;e of hot-baths de&s;troys the &s;olids, and the&s;e women at
nineteen look older than I am at this moment. They endeavour to repair by art
the mi&s;chief their con&s;tant &s;oaking does to their charms; but till &s;ome
one, more wi&s;e than the re&s;t, finds out the cau&s;e of the premature decay
of that inva|luable gift, beauty, and &s;ets an example to the ri&s;ing
generation of a different mode of life, they will always fade as fa&s;t as the
ro&s;es they are &s;o ju&s;tly fond of&mdash;</P>
<P>Our gentlemen were very curious to hear an account of the Harem, and
when we were driving out of the court-yard, a me&s;|&s;enger from the Harem
came running after us, to de&s;ire the carriages might be driven round the
court two or three times, for the amu&s;ement of the Capitan Pacha's wife and
the Harem, that were looking through <PB N="297" REF="306"> the blinds; this
ridiculous me&s;&s;age was not complied with, as you may imagine; and we got
home, laughing at our adventures.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e that carriages may proceed in the
&s;treets of Pera, or Con&s;tan|tinople, as fa&s;t as in tho&s;e of London or
Paris. A race of dogs, belonging to no one in particular but to every Turk
indifferent|ly, &s;warm in the &s;treets; and &s;o accu&s;tom|ed are they to
have the Turks on hor&s;eback turn out of the middle of the &s;treet, where
they lie ba&s;king in the &s;un, that our &s;ervants were obliged to &s;top the
carriages and lift the dogs out of the way, &s;everal times, be|fore we reached
the <HI>Palais de France.</HI> No|thing is more horrible than the &s;pecies of
this animal here, all of the &s;ame race, an ugly curri&s;h breed; nothing more
ab&s;urd than the general protection afforded them; on every dunghill you may
&s;ee a hundred fighting and &s;crambling for the filth they can &s;cratch out
of it; for the ill-under&s;tood charity, publickly given them, is by no means
&s;ufficient to feed them, and many hundreds die with hunger. No man has a 
<PB N="298" REF="307"> dog belonging to him, but all dogs are &s;uf|fered to
lie and breed about the &s;treets. Turtle-doves are likewi&s;e an object of
re&s;pect with the Turks, and they are &s;een di&s;put|ing the crumbs with the
hungry curs in the &s;treets&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER L.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have &s;een a very horrible &s;ight, though not a new one to
tho&s;e who inhabit Con|&s;tantinople or Pera. Ye&s;terday I went upon the
Canal to &s;ee the departure of the Capitan Pacha, commanding the Turki&s;h
fleet, which &s;et &s;ail for Egypt; and at night a mo&s;t dreadful fire broke
out in Con&s;tan|tinople, probably kindled by the partizans of the commander,
in order to per&s;uade the Sultan that in the ab&s;ence of this favourite, he
is not in the &s;ame &s;ecurity as when he is at pre&s;ent&mdash;</P>
<P>You may be &s;urpri&s;ed at this &s;uppo&s;ition, but nothing is
more frequent than tricks of this kind: I went up with the Amba&s;&s;ador and
many more per&s;ons into the Ob&s;erva|tory, and &s;taid till three in the
morning, <PB N="300" REF="309"> to make my remarks. The hou&s;es are like
tinder, and burn as fa&s;t as matches from their &s;light con&s;truction and
the material which is wood. The &s;cene of horror and confu|&s;ion was great,
and though the fire began at the edge of the water, and the Jani&s;&s;aries
were very diligent, above &s;eventy hou&s;es were burnt pre&s;ently&mdash;</P>
<P>The Sultan, when he wants to make the common people believe he has
no fears, goes out incognito, in a hired boat with only two or three
attendants. I had &s;een him come out thus of a back-door of his garden, ju&s;t
after the fleet had &s;ailed; the fire at night was calculated to renew his
fears, if he had lo&s;t them. But here it is known when he &s;allies forth
without guards and ceremony: it is like children that &s;ing in the dark, to
make their nur&s;es believe they are not afraid&mdash;</P>
<P>Upon new buildings or children, the Turks imagine the looks of
Chri&s;tians bring ill luck&mdash;and &s;o to attract what they call the
<HI>evil fight,</HI> upon arches or hou&s;es they &s;u&s;|pend 
<PB N="301" REF="310"> a ball, or &s;ome fanta&s;tic thing to fix the attention
of tho&s;e who pa&s;s, in order that the eyes may not be fixed too long on the
building. As to children, particularly the Sultan's, the guards hide them when
Chri&s;tian men or women would look at them&mdash;</P>
<P>All this is very childi&s;h indeed; but there are a thou&s;and
&s;uper&s;titious ideas the Turks have relative to the Franks, which is the
name by which they di&s;tingui&s;h every one who wears an European dre&s;s.
Among others, they imagine them to have an in|tuitive knowledge in
phy&s;ic&mdash;and a&s;k Chri&s;|tians oftener to give them a cure for
di&s;or|ders than any other que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The red leather pocket-books, embroi|dered with gold &s;o neatly,
and which you may have &s;een, are to be had cheap here; half-a-guinea or
fifteen &s;hillings is the high|e&s;t price for them: I &s;hall &s;end you one
or two, and beg you will keep my letters to you in them. I know, dear Sir, the
mag|nificent <PB N="302" REF="311"> out&s;ide of them will not plea&s;e you
half &s;o well as the &s;imple &s;crawl within&mdash;</P>
<P>Among many ab&s;urdities the Turks are guilty of, there is one for
which I &s;ee no rea&s;on. The Sultans formerly built diffe|rent palaces on the
borders of the Canal, which are now for&s;aken. There is one on the A&s;iatic
&s;ide in the mid&s;t of a fine gar|den, falling to ruin very fa&s;t: In it
there are yet co&s;tly looking-gla&s;&s;es and furniture, the&s;e are not
removed but &s;uffered to fall and peri&s;h as it may plea&s;e the winds and
ruin to direct. As no one is to touch or remove any thing, the Porte and public
are equally lo&s;ers; the garden, large enough to make a beautiful park, is
quite wild; and as no one goes into it, one of the fine&s;t &s;pots on that
coa&s;t, ju&s;t facing the Seraglio, is lo&s;t to every one. I find this is the
ca&s;e with every royal re&s;idence, which, when abandoned by the caprice of
the &s;overeign, is not demoli&s;hed or unfurni&s;hed, but left in the &s;ame
manner&mdash;</P>
<P>If there are many &s;imple and ab&s;urd cu&s;|toms and opinions
among the Turks, there <PB N="303" REF="312"> exi&s;ts likewi&s;e much
genero&s;ity and magni|ficence in their conduct when in an opulent &s;ituation.
No mini&s;ter of the Porte has an interview with a foreign amba&s;&s;ador, or
&s;tranger of any rank, without making pre|&s;ents; which the&s;e return
according to their opulence, or inclination to be noble. Mr. de Choi&s;eul will
not avail him&s;elf of this op|portunity of becoming rich, for I am told he
never receives any thing without giving in return a pre&s;ent of double the
value; and I am &s;ure more from the noble di&s;po&s;i|tion of his own mind,
than for the honour of his King and country&mdash;though both in him would
weigh greatly towards this con|duct. It is not &s;o with &mdash; and
&mdash;</P>
<P>You &s;ee nothing is more ea&s;y here than for a Mini&s;ter to
<HI>make money</HI> of <HI>interviews,</HI> and turn political conver&s;ations
into <HI>&s;olid gold&mdash;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="313"> The Turks in their conduct towards our &s;ex
are an example to all other nations. A Turk has his head cut off&mdash;his
papers are examined&mdash;every thing in his hou&s;e &s;eized&mdash;but the
wife is provided for; her jewels are left her&mdash;</P>
<P>The Harem is &s;acred even to that rapaci|ous power which has
&s;eized the ma&s;ter's life, only becau&s;e he was rich. It may be &s;aid,
that in Turkey likewi&s;e, women are perfectly &s;afe from an idle, curious,
imper|tinent public, and what is called the <HI>world</HI> can never di&s;turb
the ea&s;e and quiet of a Turki&s;h wife. Her talents, her beauty, her
happine&s;s, or mi&s;ery, are equally concealed from malicious ob&s;ervers. Of
mi&s;ery, un|le&s;s a Turki&s;h woman is beyond conception unrea&s;onable, I
cannot imagine that her portion can be great; for the wife who&s;e wretched
hu&s;band earns &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by car|rying water, or burthens, &s;its at
home be|decked with jewels, or goes out as her fan|cy directs, and the fruits
of his labour are appropriated to her u&s;e. In great hou&s;es, the wives of
the Turks, who compo&s;e the <PB N="305" REF="314"> train of a Turki&s;h
hu&s;band, are de&s;tined to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;tate of the fir&s;t
wife, and &s;he treats them as &s;he plea&s;es in her Harem. According to what
I hear, a Turki&s;h hu&s;band does not care for his wife, as the object of his
pa&s;&s;ion, except for a very &s;hort &s;pace of time; but as wife &s;he
enjoys all the luxury of his fortune; and I repeat it, Sir, I think no women
have &s;o much li|berty, &s;afe from apprehen&s;ion, as the Turki&s;h&mdash;and
I think them, in their man|ner of living, capable of being the happie&s;t
creatures breathing.</P>
<P>I have been to &s;ee two Greek brides in Con&s;tantinople: Their
cu&s;tom is to receive every body who has any curio&s;ity to &s;ee their
wedding clothes. The&s;e were very magni|ficent, and the women pretty; and
looked prettier from a &s;ingular contra&s;t in the turn of their features. One
had a true Greek face, her head &s;mall, her no&s;e &s;traight, large blue
eyes, with dark or rather black eyelids and hair, and her eyebrows &s;traight;
her neck long and round, her per&s;on rather inclining to lean than fat; a
&s;oft and &s;ad <PB N="306" REF="315"> countenance. The other was fatti&s;h;
had black lively eyes, with a chearful laughing countenance, her blood &s;eemed
to ebb and flow with more vivacity than her &s;i&s;ter's-in-law. Her mouth,
rather large, &s;hewed a fine &s;et of teeth, while the one with a &s;maller
mouth and prettier teeth, &s;eemed as unwilling to &s;hew them, or light up her
fine features with &s;miles, as the black-eyed bride was ready to laugh upon
every or no occa&s;ion. They had both very little red on, and the pallid &s;kin
of the delicate Greek was perfectly &s;uited to the form of the one&mdash;the
other blu&s;hed often. They might have &s;erved for good models of the Tragic
and Comic Mu&s;e. I would Sir Jo&s;hua had been at my elbow, his compo&s;itions
are fine enough to &s;atisfy a youthful poet's imagi|nation, but here his
pencil might not have di&s;dained to copy two &s;uch charming origi|nals. It is
a very rare thing in this country to find fair or auburn hair. I am told if a
&s;lave can be bought with &s;uch&mdash;many more pur&s;es are given for them
than for any other. A large &s;um of money here is reckoned by pur&s;es. Adieu
for the pre&s;ent, dear Sir&mdash;<PB N="307" REF="316"> may you receive have
the &s;atisfaction in reading my letters, that I feel in devoting my &s;olitary

<P>YOU mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e, my dear Sir, that I am &s;o delighted
with the &s;cene before me, that I mean not to avail my&s;elf of being &s;o
near the Grecian I&s;lands. I had con&s;ulted Mr. de Choi&s;eul upon the be&s;t
method of hiring a ve&s;&s;el, but the difficulties were &s;o great that, with
his u&s;ual goodne&s;s and po|litene&s;s, he has &s;ound a method of
oblite|rating them all by lending me a little frigate called the Tarleton, of
fourteen guns, com|manded by a very plea&s;ant civil little man, and his
friend, Mr. de Truguet; this little frigate is Engli&s;h built, and was taken
in America. Mon&s; de Choi&s;eul, who&s;e health requires the hot-baths of
Bur&s;a, is to ac|company <PB N="309" REF="318"> us to the port of Moudagna,
and when he is landed &s;afely, I &s;hall &s;ail for the places which he, as
the be&s;t director I can have, will order: I &s;hall take two of his arti&s;ts
with me, and in all things be guided by him. You &s;ee, Sir, my happy &s;tar is
then to permit me to &s;ee places in an agree|able manner, with le&s;s
difficulty, and more comfort than generally falls to the lot of one per&s;on.
Some old <HI>wi&s;e</HI> ob&s;erver &s;ays, a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> misfortune
never comes alone: I may &s;ay &s;o of plea&s;ant circum&s;tances&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hould imagine the different &s;tile of life here to that in
Europe mu&s;t influence Mr. de Choi&s;eul's &s;pirits, and of cour&s;e his
health. I cannot call this a &s;ocial place, the Am|ba&s;&s;adors are totally
confined for conver&s;a|tion or &s;ociety to them&s;elves, and you know very
well, it is not being incorporated into the <HI>corps diplomatique</HI> that
gives a per&s;on the qualities nece&s;&s;ary to make them good company. The
different intere&s;ts of their different courts mu&s;t inevitably make them
di&s;agree in public matters, and that di&s;a|greement <PB N="310" REF="319">
may produce re&s;erve in private life. I &s;hall give you a &s;ketch of all the
Mini&s;ters at pre&s;ent here &mdash;</P>
<P>And now, Sir, we will turn to the Greeks, which are as numerous as
the Turks here. The remains or rather renovation of Greek beauty is often to be
&s;een among them, but their patriotic &s;pirit &s;eems all centered in this
age, in a violent attachment to the borders of the Canal. It is always among
them that a prince is named by the Porte to reign in Moldavia and Wallachia;
they &s;tay generally three years, and retire with great fortunes, which they
lay out in hou&s;es and gardens in the neighbourhood of Con&s;tanti|nople,
where they are pretty &s;ure they &s;hall not be &s;uffered to die in peace,
but are generally beheaded; repeated examples do <PB N="311" REF="320"> not
deter them from &s;taying, and leading a life of continual fear. They conceal
as much as po&s;&s;ible their riches, but the Se|raglio has good &s;pies, and
the&s;e wretched Greeks are ab&s;olutely, through a ju&s;t fear, pri&s;oners in
their own hou&s;es. It &s;eems po&s;&s;ible that the &s;ight of the Bo&s;phorus
makes up to them for the lo&s;s of every other plea&s;ure. A &s;trange
infatuation, when there is another empire who&s;e religion is theirs, where
they would meet with protec|tion, and into which they might retire with their
fortunes&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;aw the other day the public departure of a new named Prince for
Wallachia. The proce&s;&s;ion was very fine, his own court and guards, with
many e&s;corts from the Porte, preceded and followed him two by two, a great
number of hor&s;es, Jani&s;&s;aries, and cooks&mdash;the hor&s;es coverings
were of cloth of gold or rich embroideries; two white hor&s;es tails on
&s;ticks, and a kind of cap like a helmet, the emblem of his dignity, were
carried before him. He was an elderly <PB N="312" REF="321"> man, and knowing
the Amba&s;&s;ador, he looked up at the windows where we were &s;itting, and
nodded. This <HI>cort&eacute;ge</HI> la&s;ted a long time, and was really as

<P>I Intended not to have written before I reached the Trojan coa&s;t
at lea&s;t, but as &s;ome account of the Sultan will not be un|intere&s;ting, I
&s;hall tell you what I have heard. He is extremely fearful, <HI>timid,</HI>
and igno|rant, totally unable to quell the intere&s;ted little intrigues of his
mini&s;ters, and direct the interior policy of his cabinet or empire. His
exce&s;&s;ive ignorance makes it impo&s;&s;ible for him to imagine it
nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be acquainted with any thing out of
Con&s;tan|tinople. He has an implicit faith in Ha&s;&s;an, the admiral or
Capitan Pacha&mdash;that man's per&s;onal bravery being a kind of refuge for
the Sultan's fears. The body of Jani&s;&s;aries &s;ometimes make a
revolt&mdash;&s;everal governors of provinces or Pachas have revolted at one
time&mdash;fires are &s;o frequent in Con&s;tantino|ple&mdash;and 
<PB N="315" REF="324"> at pre&s;ent the Ru&s;&s;ian cabinet is &s;o
<HI>exigeant,</HI> that the moment is not far off when the Turks mu&s;t be
trampled upon, or break out with an hone&s;t indignation. There is a large
party now murmuring loudly again&s;t the patience of the Porte; amid&s;t this
confu&s;ion is it to be wondered at that a man who has never been out of the
Seraglio, of cour&s;e le&s;s re&s;olute than half the women in it, &s;hould
tremble on his throne?</P>
<P>Selim, his nephew, who is to &s;ucceed him, is about
&s;ix-and-twenty, and I am told has an under&s;tanding that breaks through the
effeminate education he has received. Among other proofs of his being of a
re&s;o|lute di&s;po&s;ition, as &s;oon as he knew the hor|rid cu&s;tom of
&s;trangling every infant which is born in the Seraglio, not the child of the
reigning Sultan, he declared he would never be the cau&s;e of a human
creature's death; and has con&s;tantly avoided any opportuni|ties of becoming a
father.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="325"> To night all the people who have been

and that the rocks and &s;torms in the Archipelago were the mo&s;t dangerous in

<P>I Set out on the 12th, at half pa&s;t &s;ix in the evening, on board
the Tarleton, which contained Mr. de Choi&s;eul and great part of his
hou&s;ehold, my&s;elf, my fellow-tra|veller, and the officers; how this little
fri|gate contained us all I do not know, but &s;o it was, and all our
&s;ervants. It was the fine&s;t weather in the world, and we pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e
i&s;lands, called the Princes, to the left, which are &s;even miles and a half
from Con|&s;tantinople; from tho&s;e to Cape Bourbou|ron, which is the
promontory of land that forms part of the port of Moudagna, it is
four-and-twenty miles and a half; from Cape Bourbouron to the port of Moudagna,
thirteen. As we had but little wind, we did not make the&s;e four-and-forty
miles <PB N="319" REF="328"> and a half in le&s;s than &s;eventeen hours; and
after having landed our &s;ick but amia|ble Amba&s;&s;ador, we &s;et &s;ail
again, and when fairly out at &s;ea, we had a mo&s;t vio|lent &s;torm, and with
difficulty &s;aved our|&s;elves from the I&s;land of Marmora, a mo&s;t
tremendous naked rock, which &s;eems only placed in the mid&s;t of that &s;ea
to re|ceive a wreck from a thunder-&s;torm. I was heartily &s;ick and tired,
for the &s;haking of &s;o &s;mall a ve&s;&s;el &s;hocks my &s;light per&s;on
mo&s;t horridly. When we were ju&s;t over again&s;t the Trojan &s;hore, I would
fain have landed, but as there is nothing to &s;ee on the &s;urface of the
ground, and we had not time to &s;tay, and dig for the a&s;hes of the heroes'
buried there, we contented our&s;elves with &s;uppo&s;ing what we might have
found; we deplored Leander's fate as we pa&s;&s;ed the Straits, and found there
the Capitan-Pacha and his fleet: our little frigate &s;aluted him, he returned
our &s;alutation. We pa&s;&s;ed the we&s;tern points of the I&s;lands of
Mittelina and Ip&s;era, leaving to the left the I&s;land of Scio; to the right
that of Miconia, and the little <PB N="320" REF="329"> one of Dragoni&s;&s;a,
and landed at the I&s;land of Naxia or Naxos. I &s;aw but little re|mains of
the temple dedicated to Bacchus, which &s;tands on the point of a rock, which
probably was part of the i&s;land when the temple was built; at pre&s;ent one
mu&s;t &s;cram|ble in a boat to reach that point where it &s;tands; a fine
proportion gives room to &s;up|po&s;e it might have been very maje&s;tic. I was
&s;hewn the fountain be&s;ide which it is &s;aid the for&s;aken Ariadne wept
her lover's flight, and where Bacchus found her; it is of white marble, too
much de&s;troyed by time to admit of de&s;cription, and contains a &s;pring of
clear water.</P>
<P>The town of Naxos is a poor place; we waited near four hours to
&s;ee a Naxiote maiden dre&s;&s;ed in her holiday clothes, which are neither
decent nor pretty: A &s;hort &s;hift reaching to her knees &s;erved as a
petticoat; her ve&s;t was fanta&s;tic beyond conception, pearls, feathers,
beads, &s;owed on, in vari|ous forms; and two wings like tho&s;e of a
butterfly, &s;tuck between her &s;houlders, added to the &s;trange appearance.
Her head <PB N="321" REF="330"> and neck were adorned with gold, chains,
pearls, &s;tones, ribbands; in my life I never &s;aw &s;o bizarre a figure. We
took our leave of her, making many excu&s;es for the trou|ble we had given her,
and &s;ailed for the &s;mall i&s;land of Antiparos, which is to the right of
Paros, where I could plainly di&s;co|ver the mouths of &s;everal quarries of
that famous marble, of which, had I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a fairy's wand, I would
have conveyed large blocks to England, and laid them at the feet of my friend
Mrs. Damer, who&s;e talent for &s;culpture makes her as di&s;tingui&s;hed in
that art as in every other which &s;he has cho&s;en to profe&s;s&mdash;though
her mode&s;ty has concealed many from the world&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. de Choi&s;eul's arti&s;ts were to take a&s;|tronomical and
geometrical ob&s;ervations of the famous grotto, and I had promi&s;ed to
de&s;cend into it with them. An a&s;s led by two Greeks was waiting on the
&s;hore for me, as the heat was exce&s;&s;ive, and my com|panions were afraid I
&s;hould be too much fatigued if I had walked. Indeed it was a league di&s;tant
from the &s;hore, and we a&s;|cended <PB N="322" REF="331"> con&s;tantly;
turning &s;uddenly to the left, we de&s;cended a little, and a &s;cene truly
romantic offered it&s;elf; a vaulted &s;emicircle formed by craggy rocks,
&s;ome bearing the appearance of pillars, which &s;eemed to &s;upport the
pendant roof, and caverns which afforded a refre&s;hing &s;hade to diffe|rent
flocks of goats which the Greek &s;hep|herds had driven in, and were re&s;ting
by, was an object worthy the pencil of my companions&mdash;</P>
<P>Here we re&s;ted, and a &s;mall hole on the ground was pointed to me
as the entrance of the grotto. I was obliged to crawl in, a &s;trong cord was
fa&s;tened to the out&s;ide, and &s;everal &s;ailors and Greeks preceded us
with flambeaux; it required a good deal of courage and dexterity to proceed,
&s;ometimes I &s;at, and &s;lid down &s;mall points of rock, which were the
only &s;upport for hands or &s;eet; in two places the de&s;cent was
perpen|dicular; there rope ladders were fa&s;tened, and in one or two places,
through holes on the left, we could look down perpendicu|larly into the grotto,
where I arrived &s;afely, <PB N="323" REF="332"> refu&s;ing con&s;tantly to be
a&s;&s;i&s;ted, for I thought my&s;elf in greater &s;afety in tru&s;ting to my
own hands and feet than to the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of others, who had enough to
do in preventing them&s;elves from &s;lipping&mdash;</P>
<P>Tournefort &s;ays the grotto is three hun|dred fathoms perpendicular
from the en|trance; it is three hundred feet only; but as there are &s;everal
windings in the pa&s;&s;age, in times when mathematical calculations were in
le&s;s perfection than at pre&s;ent, the mi&s;take was an ea&s;y one. The
feeble de|&s;cription my pen may trace of this famous grotto I mu&s;t defer at
pre&s;ent; I yet remem|ber with plea&s;ure its gloomy fre&s;hne&s;s, and the
&s;weet &s;pring of &s;oft water we found in one corner of it, that made us
reli&s;h our cold collation with much plea&s;ure. My patient contemplation of
objects, which the &s;ilent and cold hand of time only can pro|duce, was very
favourable to the arti&s;t who was taking a drawing of the interior of the
grotto, intended for Mr. de Choi&s;eul's &s;e|cond volume of his publication,
<HI>du Voyage Pittore&s;que de la Grece,</HI> where I am to be &s;eated at the
foot of what they call <HI>le</HI> <PB N="324" REF="333"> <HI>Grand Autel.</HI>
Would, my dear and ho|noured friend, you had been &s;itting by my &s;ide, for!
fear no pen or pencil can do ju&s;tice to the immen&s;ity of objects I &s;aw,

<P>THE water, which di&s;tils drop by drop con&s;tantly from the top of
the grotto, hard|ens, and by degrees the fir&s;t drop acquires a
con&s;i&s;tency like a brittle and thin &s;hell; the the next extends round the
fir&s;t, &s;o that upon breaking off and examining the pen|dent point, at the
end of which there was con&s;tantly a drop of clear water, it re&s;em|bles many
gla&s;s quills that are made to go within each other; the la&s;t forming a more
con&s;iderable circle than that hardened to precede it. The&s;e are of a
beautiful colour like alaba&s;ter. The altars and pillars which ri&s;e from the
ground upwards, &s;ome of them being taller than the talle&s;t men, are of a
different colour to tho&s;e which de&s;cend, a greyi&s;h brown, and &s;eemingly
more hard than the harde&s;t &s;tone; but evidently <PB N="326" REF="335">
cau&s;ed by the dropping of the water like|wi&s;e; and it mu&s;t be a curious
&s;peculation for naturali&s;ts to explain why the &s;ame matter, in the &s;ame
atmo&s;phere, &s;hould, in their congelation, produce &s;uch different
petrifactions; the cau&s;e &s;eems perfectly natural to me; for the fir&s;t is
&s;u&s;pended, and as it were congeals in the air, while the other re&s;ts upon
the rock, and &s;ettles gra|dually into &s;tone, like &s;and in the bowels of
the earth.</P>
<P>When the Ru&s;&s;ian fleet was here, &s;ome of the officers broke
off &s;ome glorious pil|lars, which by a &s;low proce&s;s, and proba|bly by the
di&s;tillations going in the &s;ame perpendicular line downwards for ages, had
reached from the top to the bottom of the <HI>grande &s;alle</HI>&mdash;I &s;aw
them in a very imper|fect &s;tate at Peter&s;burgh, and in the grotto the tops
and bottoms of them; for the ma|terial being &s;o brittle they could not be
broken off in their length. If the Empre&s;s could know how little
&s;atisfaction the curi|ous mu&s;t receive by &s;eeing them in an im|perfect
and mutilated &s;tate in her Mu&s;eum&mdash;<PB N="327" REF="336"> and what
beautiful things they mu&s;t have been in the grotto&mdash;&s;he would grieve
with me, that ever a de&s;ire of obliging could in|duce her officers to commit
what I think a &s;acrilege again&s;t antiquity. Nothing can be more beautiful
than the &s;hapes the chry&s;ta|li&s;ations have taken in &s;ome parts of the
ceiling, if I may &s;o call it, of this place&mdash;Wherever by any accident
the congealing drop has been removed from its direction, it takes another
cour&s;e&mdash;As there are mil|lions con&s;tantly oozing out and congealing,
&s;ome of which are removed accidentally, the petrifactions repre&s;ent the
folds of dra|pery curtains, hanging fe&s;toons, &amp;c. As to the altars, as
the French call them, which mount &s;pirally towards the cieling, their ends
have been deranged likewi&s;e, and wherever the congelation has cea&s;ed at the
point, it is like a cauliflower head; and mo&s;t of them look like pyramids
compo&s;ed of cauliflowers, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be brown; the contra&s;t of
this form, as well as the colour of the &s;uperior part, is a great addition to
the beauty of the place. After the drawings were taken, the mea&s;ures 
<PB N="328" REF="337"> a&s;certained, and the arti&s;ts had perfectly
fini&s;hed what Mon&s;. de Choi&s;eul had com|manded them to do, we &s;earched
in every corner of the grotto, and found another chamber lower than that we
were in, with &s;everal rece&s;&s;es un&s;u&s;pected by us; names were engraven
on the mo&s;t con&s;picuous parts of the <HI>grande &s;alle,</HI> and we left
ours engraved in the rock, and burnt into a board, for any bold adventurer to
read after us&mdash;and rea&s;cended, but with much more difficulty than we had
entered, for one of the rope-ladders was &s;o contrived that I could not reach
from one &s;tep while my foot was on the other; how I &s;crambled up at la&s;t
I cannot very well tell&mdash;but I was not &s;orry to &s;ee the light of the
&s;un again&mdash;I was now much &s;urpri&s;ed to find my&s;elf &s;ur|rounded
by Greek pea&s;ant women, one pointing to her head, another to her &s;to|mach,
a third to her arm, all bewailing their ill &s;tate of health, and touching my
clothes with devotion&mdash;I found at la&s;t, that hearing a woman had
de&s;cended, they took her to be a &s;upernatural being, and was perfectly
convinced I could cure all di&s;or|ders; <PB N="329" REF="338"> nor could I
<HI>tirer my&s;elf d'affaire,</HI> other|wi&s;e than by di&s;tributing &s;ome
thieves vinegar which I had in my pocket&mdash;</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t &s;ingular &s;cenes I ever &s;aw, was the
de&s;cending of about five-and-twenty people after I was at the bottom of the
grotto, mo&s;t of them with torches; as there was but one rope to hold by, when
we were obliged to have recour&s;e to it, I in&s;i&s;ted that only five people
&s;hould go down with me&mdash;and the re&s;t &s;et out when we were &s;afely
landed, le&s;t the rope &s;hould break. As the pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>grande
&s;alle</HI> is winding, and as there are many gaps in it, we caught and lo&s;t
&s;ight of the&s;e people alternately and of the torches&mdash;The brilli|ancy
of the petrifactions, the jagged &s;hapes of the rocks, through which we &s;aw
the men, the darkne&s;s of part of the grotto, and the illuminations which
reflected light in new places every moment, di&s;played the &s;trange&s;t and
mo&s;t beautiful &s;cencry that can be imagined. Doubtle&s;s, my dear Sir,
there are many ob&s;ervations, ea&s;y to make, which my ignorance prevents me
from at|taining <PB N="330" REF="339"> to, but you will be amply &s;atisfied,

<P>He has promi&s;ed me two copies of his works; and there his pencil
will give you a better idea of this remarkable curio&s;ity than my pen
po&s;&s;ibly can. And now I confe&s;s to you, that had it not been that my
pride ro&s;e &s;uperior to my fears, I never &s;hould have gone down. Mr. de

of the cavern, the &s;moke of the torches, which could only find i&s;&s;ue
there, almo&s;t took my breath away, and I was forced to &s;et my&s;elf down,
or rather lie upon the rock&mdash;as I fell almo&s;t &s;uffo|cated&mdash;and I
was upon the point of going out again: but I &s;hould have been a&s;hamed to

re|turned without &s;eeing the <HI>Grotte d' Antiparos,</HI> and I took courage
and de&s;cended&mdash;</P>
<P>We &s;upped very agreeably on board the Tarleton, and looked over
the pieces we had brought out of the Grotto; but they were &s;o brittle, they
almo&s;t mouldered away at the touch; I put &s;ome into a box with cotton. As
we &s;ailed for this place we pa&s;&s;ed the i&s;lands of Siphanto, Milos,
Argentiera, St. George of Arbora&mdash;and arrived happily in the Piraean port,

<P>THE Temple of Minerva, in the citadel of Athens, was u&s;ed by the
Turks as a ma|gazine for powder, which blowing up has flung down &s;uch a
quantity of beautiful &s;culpture that I &s;hould be very happy to have
permi&s;&s;ion to pick up the broken pieces on the ground&mdash;but, alas, Sir,
I cannot even have a little finger or a toe, for the Amba&s;&s;ador who had
been a whole year negociating for permi&s;&s;ion to convey to Con&s;tantinople
a fragment he had pitched upon, and thought him&s;elf &s;ure of, will be
&s;adly di&s;appointed. The &s;ailors were pre|pared with cranes, and every
thing nece&s;|&s;ary to convey this beautiful relick on board the Tarleton;
when after the governor of the citadel, a Turk, had received us with great
politene&s;s, he took Mr. de Truguet <PB N="334" REF="343"> a&s;ide, and told
him, unle&s;s he cho&s;e to endanger his life, he mu&s;t give up the thoughts
of touching any thing&mdash;That there was an intrigue in the Seraglio to
di&s;place him, and that if any thing was removed, that plea would be
&s;ufficient for his enemies to get his head &s;truck off&mdash;Chagrined and

the performance of the promi&s;e; and we returned to the Con&s;ul's, very much
concerned at the exce&s;&s;ive inju&s;tice and ignorance of the Turks, who have
really not the &s;malle&s;t idea of the value of the trea&s;ures they
po&s;&s;e&s;s, and de&s;troy them wantonly on every occa&s;ion; for, from one
of the pillars of the temple of The&s;eus, they have &s;liced a piece of
marble, to burn into lime for the con&s;truction of a Turki&s;h fountain; and
&s;uch is the fate of many a <HI>chef d'oeuvre</HI> of the be&s;t Grecian
&s;culp|tors&mdash;</P>
<P>The citadel is in an extremely elevated &s;ituation, and if
<HI>wi&s;dom</HI> was the virtue the Athenians prized mo&s;t, the temple could 
<PB N="335" REF="344"> not be better placed, for the Godde&s;s to direct and
overlook their actions&mdash;The Go|vernor's daughters received me, and the
Con&s;ul's wife, and a relation of theirs was brought in who was a melancholy
prey to &s;ome inward di&s;ea&s;e, that was wa&s;ting a fine form and features
to decay. I was applied to, and pre&s;&s;ed to give a receipt to cure her; and,
when our vi&s;it was ended, the Governor and his &s;ons were as impor|tunate as
the women had been; &s;o I ad|vi&s;ed cream of tartar whey, being &s;ure it
could not hurt her. I am &s;ure you laugh if you think there is any thing in my
coun|tenance that may lead people to take me for a phy&s;ician&mdash;but the
fact is, that the Turks a&s;k every &s;tranger for pre&s;eriptions&mdash;I will
give you no account of our interview with the Turki&s;h women&mdash;dre&s;s,
manners, reception is the &s;ame every where, the clothes and jewels more or
le&s;s magni|ficent according to the quality of the hu&s;|band&mdash;</P>
<P>In many authors you will find an account of the Temple of Minerva;
of a &s;weet little <PB N="336" REF="345"> temple called the Lanthorn of
Diogenes, which is in good pre&s;ervation; and of the Temple of the Winds
likewi&s;e, the interior of which is not at all damaged, but the out&s;ide is
half &s;unken in the ruins of Athens, which has often been ruined, and many
things bearing the &s;tamp of the arti&s;t, are, like the arti&s;t, buried in
the earth&mdash;From my bed-chamber window I look down upon the ruins of a
beautiful gateway, the half of who&s;e pillars are only to be &s;een, on the
&s;uperior part much damaged, and, three large &s;torks ne&s;ts, with the old
and young&mdash;their filth and habitation fini&s;hing the me|lancholy &s;hade,
which the ru&s;t of time and the abominable ignorance of the Turks have ca&s;t
over them&mdash;</P>
<P>The few remaining pillars of the Temple of Jupiter Olympus, or
rather &s;uppo&s;ed to be that which contained the &s;tatues of all the Gods,
give one a very good idea of the incredible &s;ize of that temple. A hermit,
not thinking the earth mortifying enough, had perched him&s;elf upon the top of
one of the&s;e pillars, and never de&s;cended for above <PB N="337" REF="346">
twenty years; he is long &s;ince dead, but his habitation was quite large
enough for one man. Nothing can exceed the magnitude of the&s;e enormous
columns; all fluted of the Corinthian order. I think there were two very
natural rea&s;ons why our a&s;toni&s;h|ment at the&s;e &s;tupendous works
&s;hould cea&s;e&mdash;The fir&s;t is, in ancient days, &s;laves or helotes
were by hundreds or thou&s;ands to be fed, the ma&s;ters of them, it is
rea&s;on|able to &s;uppo&s;e, would keep them employed; the &s;econd is, the
climate and &s;oil were un|fit for gardens, marble of the pure&s;t and
white&s;t kind was not only found at Paros, but clo&s;e to Athens&mdash;May we
not ima|gine that this was dug out and worked up, under the direction of the
Athenian archi|tects and &s;culptors, by the&s;e &s;laves; the ornamental part,
and perhaps only the fini&s;hing &s;trokes of that, was only done by the hand
of a ma&s;ter, in either &s;culpture or architecture. We produce effects for
the pencil by the trees we plant in our parks or gardens; the Athenians could
neither form land&s;cape or &s;hade by the&s;e&mdash;but they brought to
perfection an art which gave <PB N="338" REF="347"> them &s;eats and walks,
&s;ecured from the &s;corching rays of the &s;un, by their marble edifices,
which were both u&s;eful and orna|mental&mdash;A little orange-garden, not
twenty feet &s;quare, is &s;hown at Athens, as a more delicious thing in
the&s;e days than a new temple, a pillar con&s;ecrated, or a prize gained in
the Olympic games. We make a lawn, or plant a clump&mdash;they rai&s;ed an
edifice. The variety of the&s;e, and the number of pillars, de&s;tined only to
comme|morate the mo&s;t trifling events, prove that it was the natural produce
of the &s;oil; and the impo&s;&s;ibility of their ingenuity being employed in
any thing but that which cau&s;ed architecture and &s;culpture to be brought to
that exqui&s;ite perfection in which we find it to this hour&mdash;</P>
<P>A book written by Guilletere, which you probably have, gives a very
good account of the port; but the lion and many things he &s;aw do not exi&s;t
at pre&s;ent&mdash;and the Ily&s;&s;us, that river on who&s;e banks &s;o many
philo&s;ophers and heroes have walked in <PB N="339" REF="348"> times of peace,
when the one encouraged, and the other protected, the arts and &s;cien|ces, is
now no more&mdash;it has been drained to water the gardens of Athens by many
cuts, which with the bed of the river are &s;carcely now to be
traced&mdash;</P>
<P>It was Pericles that built the Temple of Minerva; in the Citadel, on
the principal entrance, the ba&s;&s;o-relievos are executed in the mo&s;t
ma&s;terly manner; there is a female figure holding the reins to drive two
fiery &s;teeds, which &s;eem to &s;nort and prance in marble&mdash;</P>
<P>As to the ba&s;&s;o-relievos of the Temple of The&s;eus, the few
that remain are muti|lated, and repre&s;ent the combats between The&s;eus and
the Amazons&mdash;Part of the Theatre remains&mdash;and every object that I
&s;aw made me grieve mo&s;t truly that I could not re&s;tore things to their
primitive &s;tate of perfection&mdash;As to the many rece&s;&s;es and arches
over one another, that &s;eem to be|long to the Theatre, it is impo&s;&s;ible
to a&s;cer|tain the u&s;e that was made of them; nor <PB N="340" REF="349"> do
I think it a &s;earch worthy of our times. But it would be worthy the Emperor's
&s;itu|ation to take advantage of the de&s;ire the Porte has to oblige him, in
order to collect the fragments of the &s;culpture of the Temple of Minerva, to
pre&s;erve them as examples to this or ri&s;ing generations, and as models for
the ingenious workman to &s;tudy from&mdash;I am called away to &s;ee the

<P>THE Baths here are very well contrived to &s;tew the rheumati&s;m
out of a per&s;on's con&s;titution&mdash;but how the women can &s;up|port the
heat of them is perfectly incon|ceivable&mdash;The Con&s;ul's wife, Madame
Ga&s;pari, and I went into a room which precedes the Bath, which room is the
place where the women dre&s;s and undre&s;s, &s;itting like tailors upon
boards&mdash;there were above fifty; &s;ome having their hair wa&s;hed, others
dyed, or plaited; &s;ome were at the la&s;t part of their toilet, putting with
a fine gold pin the black dye into their eyelids; in &s;hort, I &s;aw here
Turki&s;h and Greek nature, through every degree of concealment, in her
primitive &s;tate&mdash;for the women &s;itting in the inner room were
ab&s;olutely &s;o many Eves&mdash;and as they came out their fle&s;h 
<PB N="342" REF="351"> looked boiled&mdash;The&s;e Baths are the great
amu&s;ement of the women, they &s;tay gene|rally five hours in them; that is in
the water and at their toilet together&mdash;but I think I never &s;aw &s;o
many fat women at once together, nor fat ones &s;o fat as the&s;e. There is
much art and coquetry in the ar|rangement of their dre&s;s&mdash;the &s;hift
parti|cularly, which clo&s;es by hooks behind be|tween the &s;houlders; after
it is fa&s;tened round the wai&s;t, there is a &s;pecies of &s;tay or cor&s;et,
that I had no idea of, but which to whom melted down as the&s;e were, was
perfectly nece&s;&s;ary. We had very pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations to undre&s;s
and bathe, but &s;uch a di&s;gu&s;ting &s;ight as this would have put me in an
ill humour with my &s;ex in a bath for ages. Few of the&s;e women had fair
&s;kins or fine forms&mdash;hardly any&mdash;and Madame Ga&s;pari tells me,
that the encomiums and flattery a fine young woman would meet with in the&s;e
baths, would be a&s;toni&s;hing&mdash;I &s;tood &s;ome time in the door-way
between the dre&s;&s;ing-room and the Bath, which la&s;t was circular, with
niches in it for the bathers to &s;it in; it was a very fine room with a 
<PB N="343" REF="352"> &s;tone dome&mdash;and the light came through &s;mall
windows at the top&mdash;</P>
<P>In the evening, the Athenian girls were invited to perform before me
the ancient dance called Ariadne's dance. A more &s;tu|pid performance as a
dance I never &s;aw; but I can conceive that the pantomime of it repre&s;ents
the de&s;pair of Ariadne, when &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf for&s;aken. A woman, that
is to &s;ay &s;he who is the mo&s;t e&s;teemed dan|cer, gets up, and with a
handkerchief in one hand, waves it about in a languid man|ner; with the other
&s;he holds the hand of a &s;econd, who leads a third, and &s;o on; they move
in a &s;tring, ten, twelve, &s;ix, eight, the number is indifferent, and this
female line moves in a circle, or according to the direction it &s;hall
plea&s;e the girl with the handkerchief to give; her eyes are fixed on the
ground, and her &s;tep is a &s;ort of &s;wim or &s;ink; the mu&s;ic is as dull
and uniform as her &s;teps, which like her eyes, never lo&s;e the
ground&mdash;</P>
<P>A &s;weet little Greek, a girl of five years old, the adopted child
of Madame Rogne, <PB N="344" REF="353"> the French Con&s;ul's &s;i&s;ter,
joined in this dance, and then came and &s;at in my lap, and went to &s;leep in
my arms; &s;he was &s;omething like my Keppel, and her little care&s;&s;es gave
me more plea&s;ure than all the languid figures of the dancers before my eyes.
To-morrow I &s;et out again upon the&s;e &s;eas, where at this hour Turki&s;h

<P>THIS place &s;eems much more alive than any I have been at yet; a
great number of commercial people, and many good hou&s;es, with a con&s;tant
variety of ve&s;&s;els arriving and departing, make the lazy Turk pa&s;s
unnoticed. The French Con&s;ul has a young wife, very lively and civil. There
is lying at anchor here the Minerva, a beautiful French &s;hip of
&s;eventy-five guns, com|manded by the Chevalier de Lygondes, a Knight of
Malta, an elderly and polite man, who happens to be a near relation of Lord
Huntingdon, and we were not a little plea&s;ed to talk of him, and claim a
relati|on&s;hip with a per&s;on which any one might be honoured to call friend
or parent. He had five-and-twenty young French officers with him, when I &s;aw
him fir&s;t&mdash;and a mo&s;t <PB N="347" REF="356"> ridiculous circum&s;tance
happened. I was &s;itting by Mr. de Lygondes and talking to him; the other
Frenchmen were laughing with the Con&s;ul's wife, when a little man came into
the room and addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, but &s;o low that I could not
di&s;tin|gui&s;h what he &s;aid, and took him to be &s;ome interpreter (of
which I believe I had &s;een a dozen in the morning) who complimented me upon
my arrival; but he &s;eeing that I mi&s;took the purport of his &s;peech,
rai&s;ed his voice, and in good Engli&s;h &s;aid, My lady, hearing that you
were here, I would not depart without offering you any &s;ervi|ces in my power;
I an&s;wered I was much obliged to him; he made his bow, and went out again;
upon which the giddy part of the company laughed very much, none of them
knowing either the per&s;on or the language. I &s;ent after him, and found out
that it was the worthy Mr. Howard, who has &s;acrificed &s;o much of his time
to the mo&s;t humane purpo&s;e; I begged he might be informed I returned to
Con&s;tanti|nople and from thence to Vienna, and if I could be of the lea&s;t
u&s;e to him in his return, <PB N="348" REF="357"> I begged he would command
me; but he &s;ent me word his route lay to Venice, meaning to vi&s;it all the
lazarettos and pri|&s;ons on the coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>There are no remains of antiquity here, but a &s;pring called
Homer's Fountain; a broken pillar on the ground, by a clear rill, &s;eems to
indicate that a temple may have been dedicated to this &s;ource, which
proba|bly bore the name of a Deity&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;pare you an account of my voyage hither from Athens, a violent
&s;quall of wind forced us to lie two days in the Port Gabrio, where I amu&s;ed
my&s;elf with going on &s;hore, and up to a convent of Greek Monks. The I&s;le
of Andros and this port, is well marked in the Grecian annals, by the
extraordinary &s;ummons Alcibiades gave the inhabitants, and the very ingenious
excu&s;e they made, in order to obviate complying with his demands.</P>
<P>The only pretty &s;hrub to be found on the i&s;lands is the
ro&s;e-laurel, which is now <PB N="349" REF="358"> covered with the flower, but
the Greeks imagine it diffu&s;es a noxious vapour, and avoid touching or going
near it. I found out one thing which may be of u&s;e to &s;ol|diers or
&s;ailors. We had endeavoured in vain to get fruit or garden-&s;tuff; a
prodi|gious quantity of large thi&s;tles was the only thing that pre&s;ented
it&s;elf: I de&s;ired the large&s;t heads might be picked, and had them boiled,
which, without being partial, I can a&s;&s;ure you, were infinitely better than
artichokes; but they mu&s;t be dre&s;&s;ed im|mediately, for if they are kept
till the next day they become &s;o hard that twelve hours boiling will not make
them tender.</P>
<P>The Chevalier de Lygondes gave me a very fine dinner on board the
Minerva. I &s;hall &s;et out again the day after to-morrow to take up Mr. de
Choi&s;eul at Bur&s;a; and hope I &s;hall meet with no more &s;torms, for I am

<P>I Arrived at Bur&s;a ju&s;t three weeks after I left the port of
Moudagna, and found the Amba&s;&s;ador rather better than I left him. The
&s;ituation of Bur&s;a is very beautiful, in a valley between two hills, and is
now a very con&s;iderable town. The waters are boiling hot; almo&s;t every
hou&s;e has a circu|lar bath under it, that adds to the heat of the climate, I
found it intolerable, and Mon&s;. de Choi&s;eul &s;et out a day or two &s;ooner
than he intended, becau&s;e the inconveniencies of the hou&s;e were too great;
he laughed very much at my &s;aying <HI>Bon dieu, nous &s;ommes tous ici au
Bain.</HI> To my great &s;urpri&s;e, I found there &mdash; who intends to
travel by land into Egypt&mdash;he &s;et out at twelve <PB N="352" REF="361">
o'clock at night&mdash;a few hours after my ar|rival &mdash;</P>
<P>I had a very plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age from Smyr|na to Moudagna. Ju&s;t
as the Tarleton ar|rived at the entrance of the Straits the wind dropped
entirely, and we found our&s;elves in the mid&s;t of a large fleet, compo&s;ed
of ve&s;&s;els of every &s;ize and nation, that waited for a &s;outh wind to
pa&s;s the Dardanels&mdash;luckily we did not lie a con&s;iderable time at
anchor, a &s;outherly breeze &s;prung up, and our &s;wift Tarleton left all the
other &s;ails, <HI>lo&s;t &s;oon to our &s;ight,</HI> far behind us; nothing
could be more pretty and lively than the &s;cene; and I told Mr. de Choi&s;eul
no fri|gate in the Engli&s;h or French &s;ervice could be a better
me&s;&s;enger than this, which I &s;hall ever be obliged to him for having
&s;ent with me. You may think it &s;omewhat &s;trange that the Mount Olympus,
which ri&s;es above the town of Bur&s;a, is con&s;tantly <PB N="353" REF="362">
covered with &s;now, but &s;o it is. This is not the famed Olympus of the
Heathen Gods, but named after it, probably by a colony, which &s;ettled there,
originally from the other Olympus. It is very common to find &s;everal places
called by one name in all this part of the world, and to this hour you know, my
dear Sir, the names of France, Scotland, and England, are given by &s;ettlers
in newly acquired coun|tries&mdash;</P>
<P>We did not &s;top at Pera, but came to the Amba&s;&s;ador's hou&s;e
upon the Canal in his boat, leaving the Tarleton at anchor where &s;he is
con&s;tantly placed. This is the only cool hou&s;e I believe in the environs of
Con&s;tantinople. The &s;ea beats again&s;t the foundation con&s;tantly, and
from my windows I &s;ee the entrance of the Canal by the Black Sea, in which,
between ten and eleven, a north wind con&s;tantly ri&s;es, blowing pretty
fre&s;h till the evening. And it is a very &s;trange thing to aver, but ju&s;t
over again&s;t the hou&s;e, ve&s;&s;els are &s;ailing, <PB N="354" REF="363">
&s;ome with a &s;outh and others with a north wind; a circum&s;tance only to be
account|ed for by the &s;hores, which form a kind of horizontal funnel, drawing
in a large body of air from the Black Sea, which lo&s;es its force after it has
gone a certain length, and cea&s;es intirely ju&s;t oppo&s;ite this hou&s;e. It
is quite diverting to &s;ee the Turki&s;h fi&s;hing boats &s;ailing very
fa&s;t, and endeavouring to weather this &s;pot when the wind is &s;outh|erly,
but in vain; they are obliged to lower their canva&s;s and tug at the oar, or
anchor in &s;ome valley, till the wind or their &s;trength permit them to
proceed&mdash;</P>
<P>If any thing could excu&s;e the infatuation of the Greeks to remain
here at the ri&s;que of their lives, this &s;ituation would plead for them; but
&s;till their manner of life mu&s;t be a torment even in Paradi&s;e it&s;elf;
there is one who, fearing the Porte &s;hould think him opulent, yet too proud
to appear in public without his attendants, rides round his court-yard every
morning with twenty hor&s;emen at his heels&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="364"> Another &s;ent me word he begged I would not
walk in his garden, for as I generally was accompanied by &s;ome of the foreign
mini&s;ters, the Porte might imagine he was carrying on &s;ome trea&s;on
again&s;t the empire, if &s;trangers were &s;een within his enclo&s;ures. This
me&s;&s;age was told me by a per&s;on who added that, all the time I was in his
kitch|en garden with my company, this wretched Greek had retired into the
mo&s;t remote clo|&s;et in his hou&s;e, fearing our curio&s;ity &s;hould prompt
us to look at the build|ing&mdash;</P>
<P>This Greek Prince had hired a French gardener, and we &s;eeing an
European gar|den clo&s;e to the Amba&s;&s;ador's, it induced us to walk into
it, as the door was open. When the Turks or Greeks have one, they walk into it,
and eat their &s;al|lads there. Fruit and vegetables are luxuries unknown in
general to them&mdash;</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been to &s;ee the fore&s;t of Belgrade, where the oaks are
extremely venerable, and, from a &s;uper&s;titious idea, not one of them is
ever felled, &s;o that the greate&s;t part of them are &s;poiling. The Dutch
Amba&s;|&s;ador has a hou&s;e there, and the Engli&s;h Mini&s;ter, both of whom
I have promi&s;ed to dine with. At the latter end of the &s;um|mer the&s;e
country-hou&s;es are de&s;erted, for there is a lake in the fore&s;t that
produces &s;uch unwhole&s;ome exhalations that, if peo|ple &s;tay in the

the Sultan's at the end of the lake, which would be pretty enough with a little
alteration&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="366"> We are now at the beginning of what is called

not even a drop of water; but at night all the &s;hops for eatables, and the
places where coffee is &s;old, are illuminated with many little lamps; and it
is a pretty &s;ight to go in a boat at &s;un&s;et along the Ca|nal. Terrapia,
Buyekdere, and all the places where &s;everal people live, look like &s;o many
Vauxhalls; and if the boat draws near enough to the &s;hore, one is apt to
imagine all the world is &s;upping together, the &s;mell of fried fi&s;h, and
mutton, and other Turki&s;h eatables is &s;o &s;trong. The Amba&s;&s;ador's
fir&s;t oar is an old venerable Turk with a long white beard, who has rowed

de Choi&s;eul's &s;tricte&s;t orders can keep him from his duty&mdash;though it
is horrible to think that if he were permitted to attend the boat, he would row
&s;everal hours in the day, in the heat of the &s;un, without taking a drop of
water to refre&s;h him&s;elf; for whether a Turk <PB N="358" REF="367"> be
obliged to the harde&s;t labour, or whether he do nothing, the law of the
Ramazan is equally ob&s;erved by him&mdash;This fa&s;t la&s;ts &s;ix

<P>With re&s;pect to coffee, which you may imagine is good in Turkey, I
a&s;&s;ure you, prepared by the Turks, it is the na&s;tie&s;t potion ever
invented&mdash;They make it weak and muddy, and drink it without &s;ugar. As to
the Moka coffee, not enough of that comes into Con&s;tantinople to &s;upply the
Seraglio, and all the re&s;t is furni&s;hed by France from her We&s;t-Indian
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, no incon&s;iderable branch of commerce as you may ea&s;ily
believe, when I tell you that every fifty yards upon a public road, under the
&s;hade of a tree or a tent, coffee is &s;old, and at mo&s;t of the&s;e places
the Turki&s;h traveller or vi&s;itor &s;tops and takes a cup&mdash;it is true
the&s;e cups are not much bigger than egg cups&mdash;but four-and-twenty in a
day to each per&s;on travelling, vi&s;iting, or &s;taying at home, mu&s;t
con&s;ume an im|men&s;e quantity&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="368"> Mr. de Bukalow has given me a very fine ball

much there? Mr. de Choi&s;eul brought him to me the other morning; he entered
my room fol|lowed by this I&s;aac, a lively, and rather well-looking man, who,
after being &s;eated a few minutes, pro&s;trated him&s;elf at my feet,
ki&s;&s;ed the hem of my garment, and laid a fine embroidered mu&s;lin
handkerchief there for my acceptance. He has been at Peter&s;burgh, and in
London, which he di&s;|likes of all places in the world, becau&s;e the common
people would not let him walk along the &s;treets without calling him,

<P>I Shall certainly not return by the way of Semlin and Belgrade, for
I am informed that four hundred robbers infe&s;t that coun|try, and what
e&s;cort could I have which would &s;ecure me from &s;o many ruffians? I have
con&s;ulted maps, and the be&s;t inform|ed travellers here, and am a&s;&s;ured
I can go through Bulgaria, Wallachia, and Tran&s;yl|vania to Vienna with great
ea&s;e and di&s;patch, with a firman or order from the Porte. This &s;ubject
was in agitation two days ago, in pre&s;ence of the &s;ame tall gloomy figure
that promi&s;ed me the plague in Greece, who gravely told me I &s;hould run
much greater ri&s;ques in taking this new route, for that I &s;hould find heads
&s;tuck up on poles at every mile, tho&s;e countries being much more infe&s;ted
with robbers and murderers <PB N="362" REF="371"> than the other. I would not
for the world have given him the mortification to &s;ee that I did not believe
a word he &s;aid, and I hope he thinks I was extremely terrified. &mdash;</P>
<P>Nothing is more diverting than to &s;ee the Greeks in
plea&s;ure-boats here, &s;topping to hear the Amba&s;&s;ador's mu&s;icians
play, which they do every evening. I mu&s;t fir&s;t tell you that they are
Germans, &s;ent to Mr. de Choi&s;eul from Vienna, and the be&s;t per|formers I
have heard, playing always the fine&s;t Italian or German mu&s;ic. The Greeks,
in their parties upon the water, have generally a lyre, a fiddle, and a guittar
or two in the boats. With the&s;e in&s;truments they make a horrid noi&s;e,
each performer playing in a different key, and if they &s;ing, all in
di&s;cordant tones; the &s;ound of the clarinets &s;tops them before the
windows, but after li&s;tening a little time, they &s;hake 
<PB N="363" REF="372"> their heads, and with one accord begin their abominable
noi&s;es again, and row away from &s;ounds which they think much inferior to
tho&s;e they produce. The &s;ervants often a&s;k them if their ma&s;ter's
mu&s;ic is not fine, but they are all of opinion it is very di&s;a|greeable.
This puzzles all my ideas con|cerning harmony; becau&s;e nature has fixed the
rules of it &s;o well that any per&s;on, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing a good ear for
mu&s;ic, will compo&s;e in all the perfection of harmony without knowing the
rules of compo&s;ition, or even a note of mu&s;ic. Why then do not the&s;e
Greeks find out they make nothing but di&s;|cordant &s;ounds when they &s;ing
or play?&mdash;I confe&s;s it &s;eems to me a very &s;trange thing.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h the Turki&s;h &s;alute was in fa&s;hion in&s;tead of the
ridiculous bow and curte&s;ey we have which indicates nothing, and is &s;eldom
executed gracefully. A Turk puts his right-hand upon his heart, and bends
forward a little&mdash;and I a&s;&s;ure you if this kind of &s;alutation is
accompanied with a &s;mile or a re&s;pectful look, it conveys to me 
<PB N="364" REF="373"> more <HI>greeting</HI> than all our <HI>bonjours</HI>
and <HI>how d'ye do's,</HI> which would be often excu&s;ed with plea&s;ure by

<P>I am not &s;orry to think the time is not far off when I &s;hall
draw nearer to Franconia; where I hope to &s;ee you; where I &s;hall tell you
many particulars which I do not choo&s;e to tru&s;t to the po&s;t. But I

a Tchouadar being &s;ent to e&s;|cort a traveller; none being found, my two

<P>You think, my dear Sir, that it was my birth, or con&s;equence of

told me laughing, he made &s;o fa|vourable a report of me, that the Vi&s;ir
&s;aid according to accounts he could not do enough for me. I have hired two
Greek boats with Greek &s;ailors, that are to row when the wind is contrary,

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Take the opportunity of my Greek &s;ailors return to write to my
good friends at Con|&s;tantinople and to you. On Monday la&s;t, which was the
third of July, I &s;et out about &s;ix o'clock in the evening in Mr. de
Choi&s;eul's boat, accompanied by him and Mr. le Hocq, a very amiable and
&s;en&s;ible man, who is <HI>Secretaire d'Amba&s;&s;ade,</HI> and the good
little Truguet. I took leave of them at the mouth of the Canal, and &s;tepped
into the large&s;t of the two Greek boats I had hired. The wind, blowing
con&s;tantly north, makes the navigation of the Rome|lian coa&s;t extremely
tedious. The idlene&s;s and fears of my Greek &s;ailors increa&s;ed the
inconvenience, for in&s;tead of turning the <PB N="371" REF="380"> point of
Kara-buron they lay-to all night, and on the fourth I made but thirty Turki&s;h
leagues. Kara-buron is a rock &s;tanding over the bay of that name, where the
Turks are now erecting a fort. Nothing can be more &s;afe or plea&s;ant than
coa&s;ting in this manner. The &s;hores of Romelia abound with many delicious
bays and fine harbours, where, upon the appearance of danger from the Black
Sea, ve&s;&s;els may run in and lie at anchor. The Bay of Agatopoly of Miolick
of Va&s;ilico I re&s;ted in likewi&s;e; and the la&s;t day I came
&s;even|ty-five miles in &s;ix hours, but not without having many quarrels with
my Greek &s;ailors, who would have delayed me more than they really did, if I
had permitted them&mdash;I am convinced a traveller might ea&s;ily reach Varna
from Con&s;tantinople in two days; particularly if he has not the honour of
being accompanied by a Tchouadar, who &s;eems to promi&s;e me much more delay
and inconvenience than his pre&s;ence can make repay. As the Greeks and Turks
know his con&s;equence, it is his wants that are at|tended to, and not mine. I
po&s;itively was <PB N="372" REF="381"> extremely diverted at my fir&s;t
occa&s;ion of finding this out&mdash;The day after we had left
Con&s;tantinople, we were at anchor in a little bay to breakfa&s;t, when upon
a&s;king my valet de chambre where the boiling water was to make my chocolate,
he could not find it, and began to make a great riot for the lo&s;s of his
kettle; when the inter|preter pointed to a flat rock where my Tchouadar was
&s;itting on a carpet &s;moak|ing his pipe and drinking his coffee, very
quietly, made with the water my &s;ervants had prepared for me&mdash;You mu&s;t
not &s;up|po&s;e he ever a&s;ks if I want any thing. If any travellers were to
meet us, they would certainly take him for &s;ome <HI>Grand Seigneur,</HI> and
that I am of his &s;uite, by the care taken of him, and the perfect
indifference all, but my two companions and my &s;ervants, &s;how for my ea&s;e
and convenience. As to me, I now and then have a&s;ked him &s;ome que&s;tions
about the places I &s;aw, to which I get the mo&s;t laconic an&s;wers; however,
I thought it right to point to two mo&s;t ex|cellent little Engli&s;h pi&s;tols
I wear at my girdle, and a&s;&s;ure him they would be well 
<PB N="373" REF="382"> employed again&s;t any offence I met with. And when the
interpreter had done I could not help calling him a &s;tupid di&s;agreeable
Turk, in Engli&s;h, which he took for a com|pliment, and bowed his head a
little&mdash;When I arrived here, he took me to a &s;habby Greek hou&s;e, where
a landing-place on the top of a &s;tair-ca&s;e was the only lodging he &s;aid
he could find for &s;ix people&mdash;but I told him I &s;hould &s;end to the
go|vernor, upon which I was taken to another hou&s;e, where a long gallery
looking towards the harbour, with rooms adjoining to it, compo&s;ed a very good
apartment. Here I found my Tchouadar had e&s;tabli&s;hed his carpet, his pipe,
his coffee, and his tra|velling bags and pi&s;tols. I thanked him in good
Engli&s;h, as I &s;hould, for his civility; and then ordered the interpreter to
tell him he might lodge upon the &s;tair-ca&s;e he had de&s;tined for me. The
Governor &s;ent to know if I cho&s;e to have a guard of Jani&s;&s;aries for the
hou&s;e, but I thought my&s;elf quite &s;e|cure, being &s;hut in by two
court-yards&mdash;However, in the evening, I was not a little 
<PB N="374" REF="383"> &s;urpri&s;ed to hear a great noi&s;e; the old Greek,
who lodged me, my interpreter, and &s;ervants, came running with great hor|ror
in their looks, &s;aying, that the Turks had broke the gates of the court open,
and were looking for me&mdash;I was, at that mo|ment, &s;itting with
Mademoi&s;elle by me, on a trunk ju&s;t facing the door; I had &s;carcely time
to under&s;tand what was &s;aid to me, when I &s;aw above fifty Turki&s;h heads
at the door, with eager eyes looking about for &s;omething&mdash;<HI>Que
veulent ils done?</HI> &s;aid Mademoi&s;elle&mdash;<HI>car n'e&s;t pas
nous</HI>&mdash;I be|lieve I told you &s;he had a mo&s;t beautiful little
milk-white rough dog&mdash;It was this animal that &s;ome Turk had &s;een
carrying along the &s;treets, which had awakened the curio&s;ity of the Turks;
and two or three parties, as I found afterwards, had endea|voured to come into
the hou&s;e to &s;ee him. This la&s;t, bolder than the re&s;t, had forced the
doors open. The little dog, as great a coward in his nature as my &s;ervants
(and that is &s;aying all I can to prove his <HI>poltron|nerie)</HI> upon the
fir&s;t noi&s;e had taken refuge under the &s;kirts of Mademoi&s;elle's
petti|coats&mdash;But <PB N="375" REF="384"> one of them, taking her by the
arm, made her get up, the dog appeared; when the Turks, with a &s;avage &s;hout
of joy, all pointed to him; and I had no doubt but he was the object they had
in view&mdash;However, when I thought they had &s;tared enough at him, I grew
out of patience, and made a &s;ign for the Turks to leave the door, which they
did immediately; and I think a Turki&s;h rabble very civil, as not one of the
party pa&s;&s;ed the thre&s;hold of the door.&mdash;</P>
<P>People imagine this coa&s;t to be inhabited by &s;avage Turks, who
live by rapine and plunder, uncontrolled by the Porte; but it is no &s;uch
thing; Greeks and Armenians, very inoffen&s;ive, live in habitations thinly
&s;cattered&mdash;Wine and corn are cultivated, but in no great abundance.
There is a place called Shiumla, eghteen leagues we&s;t of Varna, remarkable
for the retreat which eighty thou&s;and Turks made in the la&s;t war, when
twelve thou&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians, un|der Romanzof, cro&s;&s;ed the Danube to
at|tack them&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="385"> My Greek &s;ailors lived upon nothing but
dried fi&s;h during the voyage, and it is very excellent provi&s;ion, and
better than any pre&s;erved fi&s;h I ever ta&s;ted; I had often &s;een great

un|like food than the&s;e fi&s;h; but I a&s;&s;ure you they are extremely good,
having much more flavour than any &s;alted fi&s;h I ever eat.&mdash;</P>

with Jani&s;&s;aries and hor&s;es; and I hope my good &s;tar will lead me

two Turks, at the la&s;t po&s;t on leaving the Ottoman empire&mdash;By the by,

not &s;uppo&s;e that I mean to <HI>murder</HI> any one, but I think of all the
two-legged animals I have &s;een I &s;hould re|gret killing a Turk the lea&s;t.
Mo&s;t women would be frightened with the journey I am taking; but I mu&s;t get
out of this country of Mahomet's now I am in it, and &s;o I &s;hall proceed
chearfully and merrily&mdash;If my Tchouadar could but know the pretty things I

mean|ing of their &s;udden departure? He &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders, and
&s;aid he &s;uppo&s;ed it was the Governor's orders. However, I re&s;ted near a
hedge, where a caravan of merchants halted likewi&s;e, that evening, without
&s;eeing any thing that could alarm <PB N="379" REF="388"> me. When I left
Varna in the morning, my lazy Tchouadar had a whole arabat to him&s;elf, where
he would not &s;uffer my &s;er|vants to put the &s;malle&s;t parcel&mdash;I
order|ed the interpreter to tell him, if I had known his intention I &s;hould

arabat. Ye&s;terday, in the middle of a plain where the coachmen had halted,

them, and my interpreter upon a&s;k|ing what it was occa&s;ioned the di&s;pute,
I found one coachman cho&s;e to return with three hor&s;es to Varna. My vile
Tchouadar &s;at upon his carpet &s;moaking his pipe, without attempting to

in the fields, he was armed with a gun, pi&s;tols, and hang|ers, &s;ometimes a
Jani&s;&s;ary or two guarded the pea&s;ant at his work. Such a &s;ight, and a
wood I pa&s;&s;ed through, &s;o little worn by travellers, that the trees and
bu&s;hes tore off the door of my carriage, were circum&s;tances that might have
made any fine lady trem|ble; but you know, Sir, that my &s;pirits and courage
increa&s;e with difficulties, and my female companion is by much the be&s;t
tra|veller <PB N="381" REF="390"> I ever &s;aw. She expre&s;&s;ed no fears if
&s;he had any, and the &s;trange manner in which we travelled, with our manner
of re&s;ting at night, made us laugh in&s;tead of alarming us. Every ten
minutes, as I told you, our hor&s;es were taken from the car|riage, and with
the coachmen re&s;ted under trees, if they were at hand. The heat was beyond
any I ever felt. At night we halted with the caravans, and then my &s;ervants
picked up &s;ticks to make the fire for my &s;upper, and after I had
&s;tretched my legs a little, I drew my carriage clo&s;e, and had a very
comfortable bed; my companions and &s;ervants lay on the ground with their
heads under the body of my carriage, and in the morning before day-break, we
&s;et off again. But when day-light permitted us to look at one another, it was
impo&s;&s;ible not to laugh, the dew was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive that we all looked
as if we had been drawn through a river. When we arrived near this town, I
order|ed my Tchouadar to get out, and go into the town to find me a
lodging&mdash;and here I &s;aw that if his pre&s;ence had been of any u&s;e to
me, his courage would not have &s;erved me <PB N="382" REF="391"> greatly, for
in&s;tead of getting upon the hor&s;e prepared for him, he gravely turned about
and &s;eated him&s;elf in the arabat again. I a&s;ked why he did &s;o; he
an&s;wered he might be robbed and murdered before he reached the town; which we
were &s;o near to that a whole &s;tring of arabats and caravans were halting
there for the night. At la&s;t we reached the gateway, and then my
trouble|&s;ome Turk conde&s;cended to go and look me out a lodging&mdash;a
tolerable good one. Here I had a new conte&s;t with him; he intended to
e&s;cort me from hence to Buccore&s;t, but I was determined to &s;end him from
this place back to Con&s;tantinople. I enquired for the Prince of Wallachia's
agent this morning, he came, but I found I could get no intelligence from him
before my Turk&mdash;&s;o I ordered him into another room, and there found he
had received orders from the Prince to furni&s;h me with boats, hor&s;es, or
any kind of thing I &s;hould a&s;k for. My abominable Tchouadar had
con&s;tantly deni|ed that any &s;uch orders were given, in order to per&s;uade
me I could not proceed in my journey without him. However I was 
<PB N="383" REF="392"> heartily glad I had gue&s;&s;ed the truth, and &s;o
returning with my interpreter to him, I gave him the twenty guineas I had
promi&s;ed him, for the <HI>favour</HI> of his agreeable compa|ny, and told him
to wait till I had written to the Mini&s;ters at Con&s;tantinople, which I did,
and now write to you, dear Sir. This town &s;tands in a valley; upon a hill
which we de&s;cended to come here, there is a fine view of the Danube with
i&s;lands. Sili&s;tria is beautifully &s;ituated upon this river&mdash;and I am

<P>WHEN I landed in Wallachia I found hor&s;es, provi&s;ions, and
guards, provided for me, and I rather flew than drove along. From Karala&s;h,
for a con&s;iderable way, the route lay on the borders of the Danube, where
cattle of all &s;orts were feeding upon the fine&s;t &s;orts of clover,
intermixed with various flowers. There is no road made, and I &s;aw no carriage
track, but a fine &s;oil without &s;tones or ruts, made the journey very
plea&s;ant. As I came near to Bucco|re&s;t I quitted the meadows, and &s;aw a
mo&s;t beautiful country, where &s;mall woods of fine timber and Turki&s;h
corn, &s;tanding above &s;ix feet high, formed a rich and varied pic|ture.
Several boyards came to meet me, and my Arnauts, or guards, were extreme|ly
alert and clever; though their u&s;ual mode of &s;upplying my carriages with
hor&s;es often <PB N="386" REF="395"> gave me great di&s;plea&s;ure; for it
frequently happened, that a pea&s;ant mounted on a good-looking hor&s;e, with
his &s;ack of flour behind him, was di&s;mounted in an in&s;tant, a tired
hor&s;e left him, and his fre&s;h hor&s;e harne&s;&s;ed to my carriage. I
wanted at lea&s;t to have &s;ome money given the man, and an explanation of the
affair, but it &s;eems the Prince of Wallachia had ordered that I &s;hould have
no trouble or delay&mdash;and not be &s;uffered to pay for any thing, &s;o that
the little money I gave away was privately, and not without much management
could I con|trive it. Ju&s;t as I was about to enter Bucco|re&s;t, I found a
party of Jani&s;&s;aries with a tent pitched about a mile from the town, who
quarrelled with all my attendants, and made the po&s;tillions drive back to
enter the town another way as I was told, that road having been &s;hut by order
of the Prince. My &s;ur|pri&s;e increa&s;ed, when I found my&s;elf drove under
a large gateway belonging to a Greek convent, the inner court of which was very
fine and &s;pacious &s;urrounded by cloi&s;ters with Gothic arches&mdash;My
carriage was pre|&s;ently &s;urrounded by people of various na|tions, talking
all languages to me&mdash;At la&s;t <PB N="387" REF="396"> I addre&s;&s;ed
my&s;elf to one in a French dre&s;s; pray, Sir, &s;aid I, where am I? A German
&s;ervant of mine &s;poke to him in German, and I found I was driven in there
to per|form quarantine, for five days at lea&s;t. The &s;uperior of the
convent, by this time had come up to the door of the carriage: fancy|ing by my
looks, I &s;uppo&s;e, that I had not the plague, he de&s;ired me to make u&s;e
of his rooms till I had cho&s;en my lodging for the night. The old venerable
man &s;at by me and Mademoi&s;elle while we dined; and I had then &s;ent down
to the town to inform the Prince of my &s;ituation&mdash;But I a&s;ked my
re&s;pectable ho&s;t where I &s;hould lodge if I &s;taid&mdash;He pointed to a
&s;mall mi&s;erable room acro&s;s the court, with only bare walls, and the
windows of it were all broken. This room was to contain all my &s;uite with me;
for every company I found that arrived, was kept apart from the re&s;t. Clo&s;e
to the door of this room I &s;aw a wretched crea|ture alone, with death in his
countenance. And pray, &s;ays I, what is that mi&s;erable figure?&mdash;A man
&s;u&s;pected to have the plague, who was put away as far from the 
<PB N="388" REF="397"> others as po&s;&s;ible, with a little clean &s;traw to
lie upon. I confe&s;s I was heartily glad when the Imperial agent came from the
town, to inform me the Prince was very &s;orry for the mi&s;take&mdash;that it
never was his intention I &s;hould be &s;ent to the convent. I thanked my old
father for his civilities, and ha&s;tened to the town, where I had been but a
few moments, before a gold coach, made I believe in the year one, came to the
door, with a &s;et of brown-bay &s;tone-hor&s;es, that &s;eemed to &s;purn the
earth. There was a Turki&s;h groom that held the bridle of each hor&s;e. A kind
of chamberlain, with a gold robe on, and a long white &s;tick in his hand, and
the Prince's private &s;ecretary came to fetch me. The whole town, I believe,
by this time was got round the equipage, and we proceeded very &s;lowly to the
fir&s;t court of the palace, in which I went through a double row of guards,
&s;ome of them Jani&s;|&s;aries, and the others Arnauts and Albani|ans. In the
&s;econd court was another dou|ble row of guards, and the&s;e extended up a
large flight of &s;teps that conducted us to the great audience-chamber, in the
corner of <PB N="389" REF="398"> which, a &s;pace was divided off with
cu&s;hi|ons, upon which &s;at the Prince, dre&s;&s;ed and attended <HI>&agrave;

la Turque;</HI> over his head were ranged the hor&s;es tails, the great helmet
and feather, the magnificent &s;abre, and other arms which I had &s;een parade
before him in the &s;treets of Con&s;tantinople. He a&s;ked me by the
interpreter, how Mon&s;. de Choi&s;eul did&mdash;and if I would not make &s;ome
&s;tay in Wallachia. Coffee and &s;weetmeats were &s;erved, and when I ro&s;e
to take my leave, one of his chamberlains told me in a whi&s;per to &s;it down
again, when my ears were a&s;&s;ailed by the mo&s;t diabolical noi&s;e I ever
heard; upon which with a very grave loud voice the &s;ecretary &s;aid,
<HI>c'e&s;t pour vous Madame&mdash;c'e&s;t la mu&s;ique du Prince;</HI> and the
Prince de&s;ired me to look out into the court&mdash;There I &s;aw trumpets of
all kinds, bra&s;s plates &s;triking together, and drums of all &s;izes, &s;ome
of which, not larger than breakfa&s;t-cups, were ranged on the ground, and the
&s;trikers of them &s;quatted on the ground to beat them. Each mu&s;ician was
endeavouring to drown the noi&s;e of his neigh|bour, by making a louder if
po&s;&s;ible; and <PB N="390" REF="399"> I do not know that my nerves ever were
&s;o tried before; for my companion, who &s;aw the difficulty I had to refrain
from laughing, was &s;aying, for God's &s;ake do not laugh&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. de Choi&s;eul's excellent German mu|&s;icians came into my head
too at that mo|ment, and the contra&s;t of his mu&s;ic to the noi&s;e I heard,
added to the ab&s;urdity of the thing, &s;o that I &s;uffered extremely;
how|ever this &s;cene did not la&s;t long, I was called to have an audience of
the Prince&s;s&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Prince&s;s was &s;itting <HI>&agrave; la Turque,</HI> with three
of her daughters by her, they were about nine, ten, and eleven years old. The
Prince&s;s might be about thirty, a very hand&s;ome face, &s;omething like the
Duche&s;s of Gordon, only her features and counte|nance had more &s;oftne&s;s,
and her &s;kin and hair were fairer. Her per&s;on was rather fat, and &s;he was
above &s;ix months ad|vanced in her eighth pregnancy. She took my hand and
&s;eated me by her&mdash;The Prince, to &s;hew me an extraordinary degree of
re&s;pect, had &s;uffered Mr. V&mdash; to come into the Harem, and he &s;at
down by him. There were near twenty women in the room, one of whom, in&s;tead
of a turban, had a high cap of &s;able put behind her hair, that was combed up
&s;traight over a kind of <PB N="392" REF="401"> roll&mdash;This head-dre&s;s
was far from being ugly or unbecoming&mdash;The Prince&s;s told me it was a
lady of Wallachia, and that the cap was the dre&s;s of the country. After the
Prince&s;s had a&s;ked me all the &s;imple que&s;ti|ons generally a&s;ked by
the Ea&s;tern females&mdash;&s;he a&s;ked me if I was dre&s;&s;ed in the French
fa&s;hion; and told me &s;he &s;hould be happy to know any thing &s;he could do
to detain me in Wallachia a whole year&mdash;The Prince &s;eemed to de&s;ire it
as much as &s;he did&mdash;But I a&s;&s;ured them I &s;hould not &s;tay
four-and-twenty hours in Buccore&s;t. They then de|&s;ired me to &s;up with
them, which I con&s;ent|ed to, but de&s;ired I might return to my lodgings to
write to Con&s;tantinople, as I had promi&s;ed immediately upon my arrival to
this place. I was conducted back to my coach, and through the courts with the
&s;ame ceremony as I came. And being &s;eated, the &s;ecretary told me he was
ordered to &s;hew me a fine Engli&s;h garden belonging to an old boyard, which
we went to. A country curate's kitchen-garden in England and that were the
&s;ame&mdash;But the ma&s;ter of it was a venerable figure with a beard as
white as <PB N="393" REF="402"> &s;now, dre&s;&s;ed in a long mu&s;lin robe,
&s;up|ported by his &s;ervants, as he walked with difficulty. He pre&s;ently
ordered all the fruit in his garden to be pre&s;ented to me; and when I was
going out of the garden, I met the very lady, with her fur cap, I had &s;een in
the palace. She &s;hewed &s;uch tran&s;|ports of joy upon finding me at her
father's hou&s;e, that it was with difficulty I could get from her; &s;he had
taken me in her arms, and almo&s;t &s;mothered me with ki&s;&s;es&mdash;</P>
<P>The re&s;pectable father's name is Bano Dede&s;colo, and one of the
principal noble|men in Wallachia; however I got to my lodgings at la&s;t, and
&s;carcely had fini&s;hed a letter to Mr. de Choi&s;eul, when two of the
Prince's people with the &s;ecretary came in, followed by many more of his
hou&s;ehold. The &s;ecretary de&s;ired me to go and look over a gallery that
&s;urrounded the back court of the hou&s;e, I did &s;o; and I &s;aw a beautiful
Arabian hor&s;e, in the mid&s;t of a great mob; two Turks held his bridle. The
&s;ecretary told me the Prince hearing that I <PB N="394" REF="403"> was fond
of hor&s;es de&s;ired me to accept that, which a Pacha of three Tails had given
him a few days before; and he hoped I &s;hould accept of it with the regard
with which it was pre&s;ented. I gave him as civil an an|&s;wer as I could
imagine, and very hand&s;ome pre&s;ents in money to the grooms that brought
him, and to the whole &s;et of &s;table people. The &s;upper was &s;erved in a
more European manner than I &s;hould have imagined; a ta|ble upon legs, and
chairs to &s;it on were things I did not expect. The Prince &s;at at the end of
the table, his wife on one &s;ide, and I on the other. Mr. V&mdash; was
like|wi&s;e invited, and &s;at at my left. Several women &s;at down to &s;upper
with us. The Prince&s;s had nine females behind her chair to wait upon her;
&s;everal &s;ilver things, evi|dently the produce of England, were &s;et upon
the table, &s;uch as &s;alt-&s;ellers, cruets, &amp;c. &amp;c. but there were
four candle&s;ticks that &s;eemed to be made of alaba&s;ter, &s;et with flowers
compo&s;ed of &s;mall rubies and eme|ralds, that were very beautiful.
Dete&s;table Turki&s;h mu&s;ic was played during the whole &s;upper, but
relieved now and then by Bo|hemians, <PB N="395" REF="404"> who&s;e tunes were
quite delightful, and might have made the heavie&s;t clod of earth de&s;ire to
dance. The Prince &s;aw the impre&s;&s;ion this mu&s;ic made upon me, and
de&s;ired they might play oftener than the Turks. It &s;eems the&s;e Bohemians
are born &s;laves, the property of the reigning Prince of Wallachia, while his
power la&s;ts. There are, as he told me, five thou&s;and of them left, formerly
there were five-and-twenty thou&s;and. After the &s;upper was over we &s;at
&s;ome time in the large room the Prince&s;s fir&s;t received me in, but the
Prince and Mr. V&mdash; &s;at on one &s;ide, and the Prince&s;s, my&s;elf, and
the other women on the other. The Prince&s;s, I believe, thought I gave
my|&s;elf the liberties of a traveller, when I told her the ladies with us
learned to dance and write&mdash;with &s;ome other things which &s;he doubted
of, likewi&s;e &mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="405"> Her hu&s;band &s;moaked his pipe, and I was
&s;orry &s;he did not too, for I &s;aw that it was her civility to a &s;tranger

Kaunitz? and upon my an&s;wering in the affirmative, he a&s;ked me&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Should I &s;ee them?"&mdash;"Probably"&mdash;"Why
then (&s;aid he) do you tell the Prince I am devoted to his commands&mdash;and
tell the Emperor, I hope now we are &s;o near one another, we &s;hall be good
friends."</Q>&mdash;The odne&s;s of the&s;e me&s;&s;ages was very near making
me laugh; but I gravely a&s;&s;ured him I &s;hould deliver them faithfully, if
I had an opportunity&mdash;About half pa&s;t eleven I ro&s;e to take my leave,
and received from the Prince&s;s &s;ome very beautiful embroidered
handkerchiefs, and was obliged again to excu&s;e my&s;elf from &s;taying only a
twelvemonth with her, which &s;he &s;aid would be a great amu&s;ement to her,
as my pre&s;ence was full of graces. I retired with all the attendants I had
before, only with the addition of I believe a hundred flam|beaux, and all the
Turki&s;h and Bohemian mu&s;ic playing by the &s;ide of the large gold 
<PB N="397" REF="406"> coach. The horrid di&s;order and comical proce&s;&s;ion
got the better of all my gravity; and though the &s;ecretary was there, I
laugh|ed all the way to the French Con&s;ul's hou&s;e, where I now write, the
civil man and wife in&s;i&s;ting upon giving me a bed. Mr. V&mdash;'s ideas of
good-breeding were &s;o di&s;compe&s;ed, by my laughing, that he a&s;&s;ured
the &s;ecre|tary the <HI>perfection</HI> of my ear for mu&s;ic was &s;uch, that
the lea&s;t di&s;cord in it made me laugh; and he repeated this in all the ways
he could turn it. I &s;aid, <HI>oh! out, c'e&s;t bien vrai;</HI> but between
whiles I &s;aid in Engli&s;h, what would you have me do, I feel like Punch
parading through the &s;treets, with all the&s;e trumpets and this mob about
me. However, the &s;ecretary and Mr. V&mdash; at la&s;t caught the infection,
and we arrived laughing all three at the hou&s;e, where the Con&s;ul's wife had
prepared me a comforta|ble bed, and I got rid of my mu&s;ic by giving them a
handful of money.</P>
<P>It is &s;o hot that I cannot &s;leep, and I am writing to you, dear

unmercifully from the natives, through the nece&s;&s;ities of the Porte, if not
by the rapine of the Princes, and pre&s;&s;es plenty from her &s;ource, driving
often the wretched Wallaques to fly into the mountains, where, at lea&s;t for a

puni&s;hes <PB N="399" REF="408"> them for the deficiencies the extortions of

<OPENER><DATELINE>HERMANSTADT, 
<DATE>July, 18, 1786.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE fir&s;t po&s;t from Buccore&s;t is a place called Flore&s;ty,
&s;ituated eight leagues we&s;t of Buccore&s;t. I pa&s;&s;ed two &s;mall
rivers, that unite and increa&s;e the current of the river Argis, which river
runs many leagues along the bottom of the Wallachian and Tran&s;ylvanian
mountains. I was overtaken by the mo&s;t terrible &s;torm of thunder and rain
that I think I ever &s;aw, and in&s;tead of reaching a boyard's hou&s;e
prepared for me, the fir&s;t night, I was obliged to halt, and wait patiently
till the elements cho&s;e to abate their fury. I was le&s;s incommoded than my
fellow-travellers, who&s;e carriages were quite open; and the wind, rain,
thunder, and lightning delayed us the greate&s;t part of the night. When we
could proceed we went on, and re&s;ted under the ho&s;pita|ble 
<PB N="401" REF="410"> roof of a boyard, who&s;e hou&s;e was beau|tifully
&s;ituated on the river Argis, at the foot of the mountains. Here ended the
flat part of the country, which extends from the Danube, and we began gradually
to a&s;cend. I re&s;ted at another boyard's hou&s;e, and &s;aw, to the right as
I pa&s;&s;ed, a large Greek mona&s;tery, &s;ituated on the declivity of a
mountain, &s;urrounded by &s;ome well cul|tivated lands; I &s;hall not attempt
to de|&s;cribe the maje&s;tic beauties of the moun|tains; timber and &s;hrubs
of all kinds gave them a variety of greens, when we got to the bottom we
followed the cour&s;e of the river, which ran with rapidity, and its
&s;erpentine meanders were as graceful and &s;ublime as the mountains that
poured forth the &s;tream. Here and there, indeed, the &s;ides of the
moun|tains were perpendicular, and accidents, or tempe&s;ts, had thrown down
huge trees that lay acro&s;s the river, and damming up the water made it fall
in ca&s;cades. Nothing more wild or romantic can be conceived, than many places
of this &s;ort by which I pa&s;&s;ed; but &s;uch &s;cenery could &s;carcely
compen&s;ate for the dreadful road. You <PB N="402" REF="411"> may conceive, my
dear Sir, what a &s;low progre&s;s I made in the mountains, about twenty
pea&s;ants on foot held up my carriage, the wheels of which were lifted over
&s;tones as big as the carriage; the night before la&s;t, ju&s;t upon a little
plain, when my guides thought they might venture to let the carriage go, I was
overturned, and as it was for the fir&s;t time in my life, upon the ground, I
was &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed, though not hurt, that I never thought of getting
out, till Mademoi&s;elle D&mdash; repeatedly crying out, <HI>Je &s;uis
morte,</HI> rai&s;ed me out of my &s;tupid &s;urpri&s;e; &s;he had received a
blow in the middle of her &s;tomach, but it was only an outward brui&s;e, and
in two hours &s;he felt no inconvenience. This road be|tween Tran&s;ylvania and
Wallachia is torn up and de&s;troyed; it was an article in the la&s;t peace
concluded between the Emperor and the Porte, I &s;uppo&s;e to make the
con|veyance of heavy artillery impo&s;&s;ible. How|ever convenient this may be
to either power, the inconvenience to travellers mu&s;t be dreadful. One of the
carriages that fol|lowed mine was broken into a thou&s;and 
<PB N="403" REF="412"> pieces, and my new interpreter with one &s;ervant came
upon hor&s;es, having put the baggage upon others, ju&s;t in time to &s;ee my
carriage &s;et up again; as to theirs it re|mains in fragments in the place
where it broke to pieces. If any German of your acquaintance, for bu&s;ine&s;s
or curio&s;ity, comes into the&s;e countries, let him make his journey on
hor&s;eback; I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, the&s;e beautiful mountains are well worth
&s;eeing; from the foot to the crown of them they bear the riche&s;t foliage.
And in Wallachia, where the wood has been cut, and agriculture has been
employed, the fine&s;t turf, the fine&s;t crops of grain, prove the &s;oil to
be what it is, when you can &s;ee it fre&s;hly flung up; a rich black mould.
This country may be called indeed a jewel ill &s;et, what would it be under the
hands of ta&s;te and indu&s;try&mdash;</P>
<P>The timber at pre&s;ent is but little em|ployed, the trouble of
conveying it away from the mountains being exce&s;&s;ive; the 
<PB N="404" REF="413"> river is too &s;hallow, and too much ob&s;tructed to
admit of rafts. I &s;lept the night before la&s;t, after my overturn, at a
place where there were only two mi&s;erable huts; one had a kitchen ju&s;t big
enough to hold one mat|tre&s;s, which Mademoi&s;elle and I divided. The morning
waked me, and I &s;aw my Arabian gra&s;ing clo&s;e to my window, upon a little
green plain; the two Arnauts that conducted him were fa&s;t a&s;leep under his
feet; he was tethered by a rope, and &s;eemed to be much accu&s;tomed to have
attendants waiting upon him. A few hours brought me to a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e of
the Emperor's, that is upon the frontiers, &s;till at the edge of the river
that I had followed, and at the bottom of tho&s;e enchanting mountains,
de&s;tined certainly for other purpo&s;es than harbouring oppre&s;&s;ed
&s;ubjects or fugitive murderers. I cannot tell you, Sir, how glad I was to
&s;ee the eagle upon a po&s;t, and feel my&s;elf under the Imperial protection,
though I never travelled &s;o well attended, and &s;o courteou&s;ly treated as
in Wallachia. The ill-admini&s;tered government of the <PB N="405" REF="414">
Porte can never &s;ecure travellers per|fectly from the outrages of rebellious
provinces&mdash;</P>
<P>From the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e I reached a for|tre&s;s, where an old
grey-headed major re|ceived me with the greate&s;t re&s;pect and attention, and
I walked up above eighty &s;teep &s;tone &s;teps to come to his apartments.
There he gave me a &s;upper, and had &s;ome clean comfortable beds prepared for
me and all my &s;uite&mdash;This old gentleman told me he had commanded there
three-and-twenty years, and I was the fir&s;t lady he had &s;een or heard of

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been extremely well entertained here by the Governor, who is
a &s;en&s;ible old man, and the only governor remaining in the Imperial
&s;ervice, as I am told, that was &s;o named by the late Empre&s;s&mdash;He is
a Prote&s;tant&mdash;He has a well arranged cabinet of &s;pecimens from all the
mines of Tran|&s;ylvania; the gold is very fine, the gold mines are rich, I am
told they pay annu|ally two hundred and fifty thou&s;and ducats to the Emperor;
this is a tax upon the proprietors of the mines, which is about the rate of a
third of the &s;olid weight of ore extracted&mdash;viz. three florins out of
nine&mdash;a much more &s;en&s;ible plan than making all the gold or &s;ilver
mines in a country the <PB N="409" REF="418"> property of the &s;overeign, if
once di&s;co|vered; the natural con&s;equence of which law is, that the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the land which contain tho&s;e precious mines, take great
care they &s;hould never be found &mdash;</P>
<P>He is very fond of pictures, and has a collection among which a
Charles the Fir&s;t and his wife are extremely fine&mdash;and a St. Jerome, by
Guido, with a lion, is in|valuable&mdash;indeed he &s;aid he had been of|fered
four thou&s;and pounds for the la&s;t&mdash;A noble Hungarian, a Comte de
Vitzay, and his wife, who was an E&s;terhazy, with &s;ome more nobility, dined
with me at the Governor's, and the Comte de Vitzay has taken the charge of my
Arabian to Vienna. I believe I told you in my la&s;t that the Emperor had
&s;ent me word he &s;hould wait upon me, which he did. He came on foot,
attended only by General Brown, and &s;at two hours and a half looking over the
maps and pre&s;ents I have received; the maps &s;eemed to plea&s;e him very
much; and <PB N="410" REF="419"> when I delivered to him the Prince of
Wallachia's me&s;&s;age he laughed, as I was a very faithful amba&s;&s;ador.
Ye&s;terday mor|ning I was at the review, but the day was wet, &s;tormy, and
uncomfortable. The Emperor quitted Herman&s;tadt after the review was over. He
&s;ent General Brown to tell me, he had been &s;o good to order him to write to
the Comte de Soro, that commanded at Teme&s;war, and to the Comte de Colloredo,
at Peterwaradin, that po&s;t-hor&s;es might be ready for me, if I cho&s;e to go
round by Peterwaradin to &s;ee the Croat troops; which I &s;uppo&s;e you know
form a kind of militia, that, guarding the frontiers in time of peace,
cultivate the land; and in time of war are the troops mo&s;t to be depended
upon. The Emperor had given me an account of the&s;e troops, and &s;eemed to
wi&s;h I &s;hould go round to &s;ee them; but I confe&s;s I long much to reach
Vienna, having letters I am &s;ure which intere&s;t me very much, waiting for
me &mdash;</P>

<P>I Am arrived very &s;afely and plea&s;antly here, and was only
delayed upon the road by the Comte de Soro, who in&s;i&s;ted upon my dining
with him. I think Hungary a noble country, and only wants navigations made
acro&s;s from the Adriatic to the Da|nube, to be one of the riche&s;t and
be&s;t peo|pled countries upon earth. Turki&s;h idle|ne&s;s, which probably
ever will remain the &s;ame, gives a fine opportunity for the in|habitants of
Hungary to become the riche&s;t and happie&s;t people in the world&mdash;If
fate had made me mi&s;tre&s;s of that particular &s;pot, I &s;hould form a
&s;trict alliance with the Porte, a&s;king nothing but a free trade 
<PB N="413" REF="422"> upon the Black &s;ea&mdash;Can you conceive, Sir, any
thing &s;o comfortable as to have an immen&s;e wall or barrier, &s;uch
Turki&s;h &s;upinene&s;s creates, between my kingdom and an ambitious
neighbour?&mdash;How I would encourage A&s;iatic &s;plendour,
&s;uper|&s;tition, and lazine&s;s, and never do any thing that could weaken
&s;uch a barrier&mdash;Ambition, which often leads men into many wrong paths in
politics, may &s;ugge&s;t to the Imperial courts that the Turks &s;hould be
confined to their A&s;iatic &s;hore, and all European Turkey &s;hould belong to
the Chri&s;tians&mdash;but I am not of that opinion; and after the &s;ea, I
would not wi&s;h to &s;urround my country with any other de|fence than that
which Mahometan idlene&s;s could form&mdash;The Turks are faithful to their
treaties, and do not &s;eek war under fal&s;e pretences&mdash;Their revolted
pachas give them too much trouble, con&s;tantly, not to make them de&s;ire
eternal peace with their foreign neighbours&mdash;A gentleman with a fooli&s;h
trouble&s;ome wife to make his fire&s;ide uncomfortable, does not go out 
<PB N="414" REF="423"> of his hou&s;e to &s;eek new di&s;contents&mdash;Such is
the &s;ituation of the Porte&mdash;The per|petual di&s;quietude of the empire
makes the thinking Turk find a comfort in the dull moments of re&s;t he finds
upon his carpet, &s;pread under the lofty plantane&mdash;and we mu&s;t not
wonder to &s;ee &s;o many of them &s;eemingly to enjoy moments, which to us
would be death-like &s;tupidity. But as I am not the &s;overeign of any
country, I will not take up more of your time with my reflections, but tell you
that I found Prince Kaunitz here very glad to &s;ee me; he &s;aluted me with
a&mdash;<HI>Ah, vous voila ma noble Dame</HI>&mdash;I have a great
&s;atisfaction here in &s;eeing the young Counte&s;s of C&mdash; and her

opportunity of &s;eeing &s;ince her new connection with me&mdash;She is gentle,
mode&s;t, and amiable, and I find both her and her &s;i&s;ter plea&s;e very
much here&mdash;I &s;hall &s;tay only till I receive letters from &mdash; and
