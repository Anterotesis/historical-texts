<P>I HEAR there is another RIGHTS OF MAN by <HI>Spence,</HI> that goes far|ther than <HI>Paine's.</HI></P>

<SP>

<P>Yet it goes no farther than it ought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand it &s;uffers <HI>no</HI> private Property in Land, but gives it all to the Pari&s;hes.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In &s;o doing it does right, the earth was not made for Individuals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But people of all conditions have been &s;o accu&s;tomed to think that the completion of all earthly felicity con&s;i&s;ts in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Landed Propriety, that it is not likely they will generally be brought to give up the da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling hopes of one time or other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;nug E&s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, if there were no inju&s;tice at|tending the &s;tate of a Landlord, it is the mo&s;t de|&s;irable and enviable &s;tate in the world, even infinitely more &s;o than that of a King, or any Placeman or Pen&s;ioner what&s;oever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed. Every body knows that well. For the Landlord is entirely &s;upreme, inde|pendent, and arbitrary, in his own Domains, hence the title <HI>Lord,</HI> and nothing binds him but his <HI>own</HI> Lea&s;es, which he for his <HI>own</HI> intere&s;t grants. He
<PB N="4" REF="4" MS="y">is in <HI>no</HI> danger of lo&s;ing his revenues, for he pays him&s;elf in a mo&s;t haughty and lordly manner, with|out proce&s;s, and without hardly conde&s;cending to a&s;k. And when his rents are brought to him on the very hour they are due, his Dignity will not permit him to be thankful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I find you are at lea&s;t half a Spen|&s;onian: You under&s;tand &s;omething of the nature of the enemy: and I dare &s;ay we &s;hall not differ much in opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard, read, and &s;een enough of their oppre&s;&s;ions to make me wi&s;h them at an end, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether it be po&s;&s;ible we &s;hall &s;ee by and by. But for the rea&s;ons beforementioned, unle&s;s it be nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be in a State Free|men and Slaves, <HI>lordly</HI> Men, and <HI>mean</HI> Men, Land|lords cannot be &s;uffered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But mo&s;t people believe it would be unju&s;t to deprive Landed Men of their Property, as many of them have purcha&s;ed their E&s;tates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Landed Property always was originally acquired, either by conque&s;t or encroachment on the common Property of Mankind. And as tho&s;e public Robbers did never &s;hew any degree of con&s;cience or moderation in their u&s;urpations, it cannot be ex|pected that the multitudes thus di&s;inherited and en&s;laved for ages, &s;hould in the day of reclamation, through an effeminate and fooli&s;h tenderne&s;s, ne|glect the precious opportunity of recovering at once the <HI>whole</HI> of their Rights.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am &s;peaking of the &s;eeming hard|&s;hips of depriving modern Purcha&s;ers of their Pro|perty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho&s;e modern Purcha&s;ers are not ignorant of the manner in which Landed Property was ori|ginally obtained, neither are they &s;orry for it, nor for any other impo&s;ition by which they can get
<PB N="5" REF="5">Revenue. And every one knows that buying &s;tolen Goods is as bad as &s;tealing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are entirely right. The conduct of our rich Men is not &s;uch as to create much re&s;pect for their Property. The whole of their &s;tudy is to create Monopolies and to rai&s;e Rents and Revenues; and, like the Grave, their endle&s;s cry is, Give! Give!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what was originally obtained by the Sword, they determine to detain by the Sword. Are not they and their Minions now in Arms under the name of Yeomanry, Volunteers &amp;c.? And what means the inveterate War commenced by the Ari&s;|tocracy of the World again&s;t France? They know that Mankind once enlightened will not brook their lordline&s;s, nor be content with their Rights by piece-meal; therefore they exert every nerve to prevent light from &s;preading, and the union of the People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed there cannot be any thing &s;aid for them. They exhibit to us too plainly all the pro|perties and practices of Robbers. Plunder, &s;poil and contributions they will at all events have though their ill-gotten Lands &s;hould &s;wim with blood; fully declaring them&s;elves the true Heirs and Succe&s;|&s;ors of the ancient Nimrods from whom they hold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let all Men &s;ay, Spence has done right in rooting up &s;uch a combination of Spoilers, and &s;etting the world free from all exactions, im|po&s;ts, and abu&s;es, at once and for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is amazing that Paine and the other Democrats &s;hould level all their Artillery at Kings, without &s;triking like Spence at this root of every abu&s;e and of every grievance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The rea&s;on is evident: They have no chance of being Kings; but many of them are al|ready, and the re&s;t fooli&s;hly and wickedly hope to be &s;ometime or other Landlords, le&s;&s;er or greater.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you think Mankind will ever en|joy any tolerable degree of Liberty and Felicity, by having a Reform in Parliament, if Landlords be &s;till &s;uffered to remain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hould fir&s;t a&s;k if the Landed Intere&s;t will let you have a reform, which they will take care to prevent. For a Convention or Parliament of the People would be at eternal War with the Ari&s;tocracy. But granting they &s;hould &s;o far for|get their intere&s;t, they would &s;oon recollect their mi&s;take, and &s;et about their true intere&s;t again, which is to counteract every &s;pecies of public good. And full well are they furni&s;hed with every requi|&s;ite for the diabolical Work. The perpetual influx of wealth by their Rents without toil or &s;tudy, leaves them at full Liberty and Lei&s;ure to plot, and &s;upplies them al&s;o with the means of fighting &s;uc|ce&s;sfully again&s;t the intere&s;ts of the working part of the Community, and turn their labours to their own advantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it is natural to expect that whether in the legi&s;lature or out of it, their whole &s;tudy will be, under every kind of Government, to en|crea&s;e the prices of what their E&s;tates produce, that their rents may ri&s;e. What &s;hall we then account &s;uch a body of People, who&s;e intere&s;ts are only their own, and &s;o oppo&s;ite to all others, but a pub|lic Enemy, a Banditti that mu&s;t always be watched and &s;ometimes re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you are wrong with your watch|ing and re&s;i&s;ting. Who is to watch and re&s;i&s;t? Mu&s;t not all the re&s;t of the world do &s;omething for their Bread? And are they not di&s;armed by the Game Laws, awed by the Military, and by Monopolies, State Tricks, Rents and Taxes reduced to continual Drudgery and Starvation? How many days do you think &s;uch a brood of Beggars could maintain them|&s;elves in a &s;tate of In&s;urrection again&s;t their Op|pre&s;&s;ors?
<PB N="7" REF="7">They mu&s;t away to their work again. The cries of their fami&s;hed Families break up their Campaigns before they are well begun, and they mu&s;t again return to the yoke, like other &s;tarved animals, for mere &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>O hopele&s;s &s;tate of Mankind!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it is not yet hopele&s;s, though the ene|my, like a numerous Army, be garri&s;oned and quartered every where among us, and have all the &s;trong Holds, all the Arms, and every advantage that triumphant and cruel Invaders could wi&s;h for, yet will a true and univer&s;al knowledge of Spence's plain and &s;imple Sy&s;tem overturn them, and &s;weep all their Greatne&s;s and Lordline&s;s away in one Day, and leave the world in perpetual and perfect Peace:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some &s;eem to apprehend the mi&s;manage|ment of the Pari&s;h Revenues, and &s;o di&s;courage People from thinking of that Sy&s;tem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the natural work of the Enemy, and mu&s;t be expected. But it does not become Demo|crats to doubt concerning it. For if Men cannot manage the Revenues and affairs of a Pari&s;h, what mu&s;t they do with a State? It is almo&s;t as ab&s;urd to an&s;wer &s;uch quibbles as to make them. How &s;trange that Men will turn the world up&s;ide down to get the management of a Nation, and yet pretend to de&s;pair concerning a Pari&s;h!!! It is too bad. The villainy is too barefaced, I am weary with combatting the vile &s;ophi&s;try of Scoundrels that are Oppre&s;&s;ors, and of Scoundrels that would be Oppre&s;&s;ors. But in Spence's Pigs' Meat, you will find the Pari&s;h Sy&s;tem repre&s;ented in &s;uch a variety of ways, and &s;o plainly evidencing to every Reader, the ea&s;y and practicable tran&s;ition from this &s;cene of Oppre&s;&s;ion and Woe, to perfect Freedom and Felicity, that I mu&s;t refer you to that incomparable Work for complete &s;atisfaction on the Subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you. I will take the fir&s;t oppor|tunity of peru&s;ing that excellent Book. But in the mean time, for the &s;ake of conver&s;ation, let us &s;up|po&s;e that a whole Nation no matter whether Ame|rica, France, Holland, or any other, but as to En|gland, it is entirely out of the Que&s;tion, were fully convinced of the excellence of this Sy&s;tem, and univer&s;ally wi&s;hing its e&s;tabli&s;hment, I &s;hould be glad to know the mo&s;t ea&s;y method of doing &s;o, and with lea&s;t blood&s;hed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a Country &s;o prepared, let us &s;uppo&s;e a few Thou&s;ands of hearty determined Fellows well armed and appointed with Officers, and having a Committee of hone&s;t, from, and intelligent Men to act as a provi&s;ionary Government, and to direct their Actions to the proper Object. If this Com|mittee publi&s;hed a Manife&s;to or Proclamation, di|recting the People in every Pari&s;h to take, on receipt thereof, immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole Landed Property within their di&s;trict, appointing a Com|mittee to take charge of the &s;ame, in the name and for the u&s;e of the Inhabitants; and that every Landholder &s;hould immediately, on pain of Con|fi&s;cation and Impri&s;onment, deliver to the &s;aid pa|rochial Committee, all Writings and Documents relating to their E&s;tates, that they might immedi|ately be burnt; and that they &s;hould likewi&s;e di&s;|gorge at the &s;ame time into the Hands of the &s;aid Committee, the la&s;t payments received from their tenants, in order to create a parochial Fund for im|mediate u&s;e, without calling upon the exhau&s;ted People. If this Proclamation was generally attended to, the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;ettled at once; but if the Ari&s;tocracy aro&s;e to contend the matter, let the People be firm and de&s;perate, de&s;troying them Root and Branch, and &s;trengthening their Hands by the rich Confi&s;cations, Thus the War would be carried on at the expence of the wealthy enemy; and the
<PB N="9" REF="9">Soldiers of Liberty be&s;ide the hope of &s;haring in he future felicity of the country, being well paid, would be &s;teady and bold. And wherever the Lands were taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by the People, (which by all means &s;hould be as early accompli&s;h|ed as po&s;&s;ible) the grand re&s;ource of the Ari&s;tocracy, the Rents, would be cut off, which would &s;oon re|duce them to Rea&s;on, and they would become as harmle&s;s as other men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If People could but thus become hone&s;t and wi&s;e enough to cut off at once the re&s;ources of the enemy, they might &s;oon get rid of Oppre&s;&s;ion. But it is a pity they do not perceive the immediate and inexpre&s;&s;ible ble&s;&s;ings that would infallably re&s;ult from &s;uch a Revolution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The good Effects of &s;uch a change, would be more exhilirating and reviving to the hunger-bitten and de&s;pairing Children of Oppre&s;&s;ion, than a be|nign and &s;udden Spring to the fro&s;t-bitten Earth, after a long and &s;evere Winter. Only think of the many millions of Rents that are now paid to tho&s;e &s;elf-created Nephews of God Almighty, the Land|ed Intere&s;t, which is literally paid for nothing but to create Ma&s;ters.&mdash;I &s;ay only think of all this Mo|ney, circulating among the People, and there pro|moting Indu&s;try and Happine&s;s, and all the arts and callings u&s;eful in Society; would not the change be un&s;peakable? This would neither be a barren Revolution of mere unproductive Rights, &s;uch as many contend for, nor yet a glut of &s;udden and temporary Wealth as if acquired by conque&s;t; but a continual flow of permanent Wealth establi&s;hed by a System of Truth and Justice, and guaranteed by the interest of every Man, Woman, and Child in the Nation. The Government al&s;o of &s;uch a People could no longer be oppre&s;&s;ive. The demo|cratic Pari&s;hes would take care how they &s;uffered their Money to be lavi&s;hed away upon State &s;pe|culations.
<PB N="10" REF="10">And their Senators, who could not be Men of landed Property, would be found to be much more honest and true to the &s;ervices of their Constituents than our now-a-days &s;o much boasted Gentlemen of independent Fortunes.</P>
<P>When a People create Landlords, they create a numerous host of hereditary Tyrants and Oppre&s;|&s;ors, who not content with their Lordly Revenues of Rents, &s;eize al&s;o upon the Government, and parcel it out among them&s;elves, and take as enor|mous &s;alaries for the Places they occupy therein, as if they were poor Men; &s;o that the Rents which the fooli&s;h People fooli&s;hly pay, they pay for no|thing, and the poor dull A&s;s the Public, become thus loaded, as it were, with two pair of Panyers. So then, whoever will be &s;o &s;illy good-natured and over-generous as to pay Rents to a &s;et of Individuals, must not be &s;urprized, if their Masters by all ways and means and pretences &s;hould keep them to it, and give Scope &s;ufficient to their liberal propen&s;i|ties.</P>
