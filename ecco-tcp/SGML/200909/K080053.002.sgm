<P>MY adoption of the word <HI>Pater,</HI> in the Hexham In&s;cription, engraved, and facing page 91, vol. I. having been objected to by an anonymous writer, in order to &s;hew it was by no means improper or &s;ingular, I beg leave to refer the reader to the 2d volume of the Archaeologia, page 190, where in the <HI>Sa|li&s;bury In&s;cription</HI> commented on by <HI>Mr Gough,</HI> the words are <HI>Pater Eccle&s;iae Sali&s;birien&s;is;</HI> and that writer gives it the antiquity of the beginning of the 12th century, the &s;uppo&s;ed per&s;onage for whom that tomb was erected, Roger third Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, having been elected A. D. 1102 to that See. <Q>His munifi|cence to his infant church intitled him to the name of Pater Eccle&s;iae Sali&s;birien&s;is,</Q> are his words. The aera and occa&s;ion agree critically in the two in&s;tances: others might be pointed out; but this, from its pertinence, may &s;eem &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>In my account of <HI>Blanchland,</HI> page 119, by former writers I was led into an error, touching the family of For&s;ters, to whom it formerly appertained. This, I pre&s;ume, will appear to be duly rectified, in the account of Bambrough, in this volume.</P>
<P>The liberal minded reader, I flatter my&s;elf, will make allowances for &s;uch errors as appear in this work, which, con&s;i&s;tent with its title, is <HI>a View</HI> of the County.</P>

As being on the borders, this ca&s;tle was &s;ubject to repeated a&s;&s;aults.</P>
<P>On King Stephen's u&s;urpation of the Engli&s;h crown, David of Scot|land, with great indignation, entered the borders, and among other fortre&s;&s;es a&s;&s;aulted and took <HI>Carrum,</HI> which Richard of Hexham &s;ays was by the Engli&s;h called <HI>Werk.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is an error in the Hi&s;torian, the places are di&s;tinct, and &s;eparate a con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</NOTE> On a treaty held whil&s;t Stephen lay at <HI>Durham</HI> and David at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> the&s;e conque&s;ts were re&s;tored by the Scotch King, who took as a compen&s;ation, <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> and &s;ome other places of le&s;s import, as additions to the <HI>Earldom of Huntington,</HI> which was then ratified to him: Stephen al&s;o engaged, that before any di&s;po|&s;ition was made of the <HI>Earldom of Northumberland,</HI> he would cau&s;e the claim of Henry (David's &s;on) thereto, in right of his mother, to be fairly heard by his Judges. David received in marriage, from King Henry I. of England, his brother-in-law, Maud, the elde&s;t daughter of Waltheof Earl of Northumberland, from whom Henry his &s;on de|rived his preten&s;ions to that Earldom. Henry, by the re&s;ignation of his father, and King Stephen's ratification, held the Earldom of Hunting|ton.</P>
<P>The determination of Henry's claim to Northumberland being &s;u&s;|pended, and Stephen unwilling to bring it to a fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, &s;en&s;ible of the great power it would give to the Scotch crown, irritated David to &s;upport his &s;on's preten&s;ions by force of arms. Stephen's ab&s;ence in Normandy favoured his purpo&s;e; and &s;oon after Ea&s;ter, in the year 1137, he levied a great army, with intent to invade England. The northern Barons, with Thur&s;tan Archbi&s;hop of York, a&s;&s;embled the Engli&s;h forces at Newca&s;tle; and the Archbi&s;hop proceeding to Rox|burgh, then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Scotch King, in conference with David and his &s;on, prevailed on them to enter into a truce till Stephen's return, when it was pre&s;umed the matter in conte&s;t would be honour|ably accommodated: but Stephen per&s;i&s;ting in a denial of Henry's right, war immediately en&s;ued.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">The winter was &s;et in, when David, flattered with hopes of an in|&s;urrection in England, a plot <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ordericus Vitalis.&mdash;L. 13. p. 912.</NOTE> having been laid to ma&s;&s;acre all the <HI>Normans,</HI> and deliver the kingdom to him, who was neare&s;t heir in the <HI>Saxon line,</HI> not regarding the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, di&s;patched his ne|phew William, &s;on of Duncan, with part of his army, again&s;t the Ca&s;tle of Wark.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Richard of Hexham, John of Hexham.&mdash;Redpath's Border Hi&s;tory.</NOTE></P>
<P>William inve&s;ted this fortre&s;s early in the morning, and David with a numerous army and engines of war, advanced &s;oon afterwards to maintain the &s;iege. This inve&s;titure continued three weeks, during which time the mo&s;t vigorous a&s;&s;aults were &s;u&s;tained by the garri&s;on, under command of Jordan de Bu&s;&s;is, nephew of Walter D'E&s;pec, Lord of Wark.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Walter D'E&s;pec had great e&s;tates in York&s;hire, and was founder of the Abbey of Rievalle, which he filled with Monks from St. Barnard. The &s;cite of this abbey is by ancient writers de|&s;cribed to be melancholy and de&s;ert, on a tract of land called Blackowmor, on the banks of the river Rie, from whence the mona&s;tery had the name of Rievalle. Rie empties it&s;elf into Derwent. The abbey, of which there are fine remains to this day, &s;tands near Helm&s;ley, in York&s;hire. We find a particular de&s;cription of Walter D'E&s;pec given by Ethelred or Ailred, &s;econd Abbot of Rievalle, an elegant and &s;pirited writer, in his Hi&s;tory of the Battle of the Standard. He is there repre&s;ented as a per&s;on of the fir&s;t eminence and e&s;teem in the Engli&s;h army, harangu|ing them before the battle from the carriage in which the famous &s;tandard was erected. <Q>Vir &s;enex et plenus Dierum, acer ingenio, in Con&s;iliis prudens, in Bello Amicitiam Sociis, fidem &s;em|per Regibus &s;ervans.

<P>An account of the di&s;po&s;itions made by both armies before the battle known by the name of <HI>Bellum Standardi,</HI> as collected from Hi&s;torians of character, may not be di&s;agreeable to the reader in this place, though not pertinent to this work.</P>
<P>This expedition of <HI>David</HI>'s was unfortunate to the <HI>Scotch:</HI> they were joined by <HI>Eu&s;tace Fitz-John Lord of Alnwick,</HI> who re&s;ented <HI>Stephen</HI>'s taking from him <HI>Bambrough,</HI> and who hoped to have regained that fortre&s;s by the arms of the Scotti&s;h King. The <HI>ca&s;tle</HI> &s;u&s;tained the a&s;&s;ault of the whole army, and remained impregnable. <HI>David</HI> with fire and &s;word laid wa&s;te the country to <HI>Durham,</HI> where he was joined by the men of <HI>Galloway, Cumberland,</HI> and <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> augment|ing his army &s;o, that it con&s;i&s;ted of 26,000 men at the lea&s;t. He was oppo&s;ed near <HI>Northaller|ton</HI> by a much &s;maller number, chiefly con&s;i&s;ting of the nobles and men of York&s;hire, headed by their <HI>Archbi&s;hop Thur&s;ton,</HI> who&s;e pre&s;ence animated them to the highe&s;t pitch of bravery. The ma&s;t of a &s;hip, having on its top a cro&s;s, wherein was the con&s;ecrated ho&s;t in a &s;ilver pix, and the banners of St. Peter, St. John of Beverley, and St. Wilfrid of Ripon waving below it, was erected on the beam of a va&s;t chariot. Around this &s;tandard, and &s;ome of them upon the carriage on which it &s;tood, were placed the more aged of the Engli&s;h Barons, and with the&s;e <HI>Roger de Moubrai</HI> the infant Earl of <HI>Northumberland. Roger</HI> was the &s;on of <HI>Negel de Albanei,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="6">who at the battle of <HI>Tinchebrai,</HI> in Normandy, took Duke Robert pri&s;oner; for which and other great &s;ervices, King Henry rewarded him by a gift of the lands of <HI>Robert de Moubrai</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> which had been forfeited on account of his rebellion again&s;t William Rufus. His pre&s;ence drew around him all his va&s;&s;als, who made no incon&s;iderable part of the Engli&s;h army. Immediately before the battle, <HI>Ralph Bi&s;hop of the Orkneys,</HI> deputed by the aged and infirm <HI>Thur&s;tan,</HI> having a&s;&s;ured the army that by fighting bravely they would purcha&s;e the remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, did, on receiving their confe&s;&s;ions, actually pronounce their ab&s;olution, joining to it his benediction; at the &s;ame time the prie&s;ts in their white ve&s;tments carrying cro&s;&s;es and relics, went among the ranks, encouraging the &s;oldiers by their exhortations and prayers. The&s;e pious acts were accompanied with a wi&s;e arrangement of the Engli&s;h warriors, adapted to &s;u&s;tain and repel the fir&s;t fierce on&s;et of their enemies. The <HI>Abbot of Rievalle</HI> re|lates, that <HI>David</HI> was prevented making the di&s;po&s;ition he intended by the ob&s;tinacy of the <HI>Gall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">waymen,</HI> who claimed it as their right to fight in the van, a &s;tation which <HI>David</HI> and his be&s;t officers perceived they were not fit for, on account of their wanting heavy armour, &s;uch as was borne by tho&s;e who &s;tood in the fir&s;t rank of the Engli&s;h army. The King however fear|ing &s;edition, at a time when it might have proved &s;o fatal, was obliged to grant the&s;e troops their reque&s;t. The next line was commanded by <HI>Prince Henry,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting, as <HI>Aulred</HI> &s;ays, of knights and archers, or according to <HI>Huntington,</HI> of Engli&s;h and Norman hor&s;emen, who be|longed to his father's hou&s;ehold, and with them the men of <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Tiviotdale.</HI> In this divi&s;ion was al&s;o <HI>Eu&s;tace Fitz-John.</HI> The third line con&s;i&s;ted of the <HI>Laodomains</HI> with the <HI>I&s;landers</HI> and <HI>Lavernans.</HI> The King had in his own line the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Murraymen,</HI> and for his body guard a band of Engli&s;h and Scotch Knights. <HI>Robert Brus</HI> and <HI>Bernard Baliol,</HI> both of whom, be&s;ides the great e&s;tates they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in England, did al&s;o hold lands of the Scotti&s;h King, went to him before the battle, and endeavoured to per&s;uade him to retire, a&s;&s;uring him that <HI>Northumberland</HI> &s;hould be delivered to his &s;on <HI>Henry;</HI> but not being able to prevail, they renounced their fealty to <HI>David,</HI> and returned to fight under the Engli&s;h &s;tandard."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Richard Hagul&s;t.&mdash;Ailz.

<P><PB N="4" REF="6">David was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege with di&s;grace; his forces were much reduced, and his Standard-bearer fell among the &s;lain. The bor|der conflicts were all after one mode, rendered horrible by ravage and rapine. David, after his departure from before <HI>Wark,</HI> led his forces to the we&s;tern parts of Northumberland, where he &s;pread de&s;olation and ruin, and marked his progre&s;s as far as Tyne with acts of &s;avage cruelty.</P>
<P>To oppo&s;e the&s;e invaders, Stephen at the head of a numerous army advanced to <HI>Wark,</HI> which obliged David to abandon Northumberland, and prepare to defend his own territories: but Stephen, apprized of a plot which was laid to entrap him at <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> returned to England without effecting any thing again&s;t his enemy. David &s;eeing the Eng|li&s;h forces had abandoned the border, after taking and demoli&s;hing <HI>Norham,</HI> advanced again&s;t <HI>Wark,</HI> to revenge an in&s;ult the garri&s;on had committed, by taking &s;ome baggage, and giving annoyance to his troops, marching under his &s;on Henry. His &s;ucce&s;s in this &s;econd at|tempt was no better than in his former a&s;&s;ault; he exerted his powers, employed every engine the art of war had introduced, and with much
<PB N="5" REF="7">
blood&s;hed per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;iege; till conceiving the fortre&s;s was im|pregnable to every other manoeuvre than a blockade, which could cut off provi&s;ions and reinforcement, he determined thereon; and march|ing &s;outhward with the main body of his army, left there a circumval|lation of troops, under the care of two of his Barons.</P>
<P>David &s;oon after had a dreadful defeat near <HI>Northallerton,</HI> at the <HI>Battle of the Standard;</HI> after which he retreated with the &s;hattered remains of his troops to <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> through a country enraged at the barbarities he had been guilty of in his former incur&s;ion: the pea&s;ants in every avenue revenging on his flying troops, the &s;ufferings their families had &s;u&s;|tained. After a &s;hort re&s;pite, and a collection of his &s;cattered army at <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> he commanded the &s;iege of <HI>Wark</HI> to be re&s;umed, in which many new-invented engines and machines were employed. The be|&s;ieged with unparallelled fortitude &s;u&s;tained the &s;hock: their &s;kilfulne&s;s is as admirable as their courage, for they lo&s;t but one Knight, who&s;e in|trepidity in attacking a machine, expo&s;ed him to numbers of a&s;&s;ailants, in the mid&s;t of whom he fell, after te&s;tifying the highe&s;t human valour. The &s;laughter made by the garri&s;on was terrible; in&s;omuch that David, relaxing his rigorous command, cea&s;ed all a&s;&s;aults, and again formed a &s;trong blockade. The garri&s;on were reduced to great extremities; they had killed their hor&s;es, and &s;alted their fle&s;h for food, and when that was nearly con&s;umed, re&s;olved, as &s;oon as all provi&s;ion was exhau&s;ted, to make a general &s;ally, and cut their pa&s;&s;age through the lines of the a&s;&s;ailants, or die &s;word in hand. During this interval, <HI>Walter D'E&s;pec,</HI> their Lord, willing to pre&s;erve &s;o brave a corps, &s;ent the Abbot of Rie|valle with his command, that the garri&s;on &s;hould &s;urrender the place: on who&s;e arrival a treaty was entered into, in con&s;equence of which the garri&s;on capitulated, and were permitted to march out of the ca&s;tle un|der arms, with 20 hor&s;es provided them by the Scotch King. On this evacuation, the ca&s;tle was demoli&s;hed, and the fortifications were ra&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>King Henry</HI> II. to &s;trengthen the frontiers of his kingdom again&s;t the Scots, ordered the fortifications of the ca&s;tle of <HI>Wark</HI> to be re&s;tored.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A.D. 1158, Iterum firmatum e&s;t ca&s;tellum de Werk praecepto Regis. Lel. Collecta. 206.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>King John,</HI> in the year 1215, in re&s;entment of the defection of the northern Barons, who had done homage to Alexander II. at <HI>Mailro&s;s,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
advanced to the borders, and, among&s;t other places, reduced <HI>Wark</HI> to a&s;hes. M. Paris gives the following account of this horrid expedition: <Q>Deinde Rex Ira &s;uccen&s;us, vehementi apud partes Scotiae tendebat ci&s;marinas, et captis Ca&s;tris de Berwic, et aliis quae videbantur inex|pugnabilia, improperavit Regi Alexandro, et quia erat Rufus, &s;igni|cavit ei, dicens, &s;ic &s;ic fugabimus rubeam vulpeculam latibulis &s;uis, multum igitur ibidem &s;tragem et exterminium exercui&s;&s;et, ni&s;i eundem nece&s;&s;itas magna dilationem non capiens revoca&s;&s;et.</Q></P>
<P><HI>King Edward,</HI> on the breach of fealty by John Baliol, in the year 1296, having levied a great army, advanced towards the Scotch bor|ders; and halting at <HI>Bamburgh,</HI> received intelligence that Robert de Ro&s;s, Lord of <HI>Wark,</HI> had abandoned his ca&s;tle, and gone over to the Scots, being enamoured of a Scotch woman, who&s;e affection he pre|ferred to his duty and allegiance: his brother William remaining in the fortre&s;s, di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to require immediate aid of the King, as he apprehended Robert would attempt to deliver <HI>Wark</HI> to the enemy. King Edward immediately ordered 1000 men to march to &s;u&s;tain William and his garri&s;on, who, on their arrival, were attacked in their quarters in the night, in a &s;mall village called <HI>Pre&s;tfeu,</HI> by Ro|bert de Ro&s;s, with a detachment from <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> who burnt the village, and put the reinforcement to the &s;word. King Edward &s;oon after this di&s;a&s;ter marched with his whole army to <HI>Wark,</HI> where he continued to celebrate the fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the reign of King Edward II. 1318, <HI>Wark</HI> was taken by the Scots, under King Robert Brus, by a&s;&s;ault. In Leland's Collecta. p. 548, it is &s;aid, that the Scottes came into the Marches of England, and de|&s;troyed the ca&s;telles of Wark and Harbottle.</P>
<P>As King David Bruce with his victorious army was returning from Durham in the &s;ummer of the year 1341, where he had imbrued his hands in the horrid ma&s;&s;acre of all ages and both &s;exes, had &s;poiled and plundered the &s;acred places, and put the religious to mi&s;erable deaths, the rear of his army pa&s;&s;ing the ca&s;tle of <HI>Wark</HI> loaden with &s;poils, were &s;een by the garri&s;on with the greate&s;t indignation. Sir William Mon|tague was then Governor, and the Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, who&s;e Lord the fortre&s;s then belonged to, re&s;ided there. The Governor with 40 hor&s;emen made a &s;ally, attended with con&s;iderable &s;laughter, bringing into the ca&s;tle 160 hor&s;es laden with booty. King David, incen&s;ed at
<PB N="7" REF="9">
this in&s;ult, led his army again&s;t the ca&s;tle, and made a general a&s;&s;ault, but met with a repul&s;e attended with great blood&s;hed. David then prepared to fill up the ditches, and bring his battering engines to play upon the walls: the imminent danger of the garri&s;on rendered it nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;end information of their &s;ituation to the Engli&s;h Monarch, who was approaching the borders with a con&s;iderable army. The place be|ing clo&s;e inve&s;ted, rendered &s;uch an attempt perilous, but it was ef|fected by the Governor him&s;elf, on a fleet hor&s;e, in the darkne&s;s and tumult of a &s;tormy night: he pa&s;&s;ed through the enemy's lines, and carried intelligence to King Edward, who redoubled his &s;peed to relieve the place. The Scotch Chieftains, unwilling to hazard the trea&s;ures they had reaped in their expedition, per&s;uaded the King to rai&s;e the &s;iege and pa&s;s the Tweed; which was done only &s;ix hours before the van of the Engli&s;h army appeared. The joy of the Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury for this relief, and her plea&s;ing deportment whil&s;t &s;he entertained the King at Wark, were the beginning of an amour, to which the famous in&s;titution of <HI>the order of the Garter</HI> is &s;aid to owe its origin.</P>
<P>In the reign of King Richard II. 1383,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A. D. 1383 &amp; 7 Rich. Scotti ceperunt ca&s;tellum de Werk &s;uper Fluv Twede &amp; depraedatum incenderunt. Lel. Collecta. 252.</NOTE> it was be&s;ieged by the Scots, and part of the fortifications de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Soon after the acce&s;&s;ion of King Henry IV. the truce made with Richard II. expiring, the Scots made an incur&s;ion, in which they took the ca&s;tle of Wark, and after holding it &s;ome time, utterly demoli&s;hed the works. It was a fortre&s;s of too much con&s;equence to be neglected, and therefore we find it &s;oon after re&s;tored and in a &s;tate of defence: for in the &s;ame reign it &s;u&s;tained many &s;hocks, with various degrees of fortune. In 1419, in the ab&s;ence of the King of England, who was then in France, ho&s;tilities being commenced on the borders, William Haliburton of Fa&s;t Ca&s;tle took the ca&s;tle of <HI>Wark,</HI> which was then in the keeping of Robert Ogle, and put all the garri&s;on to the &s;word; but it was &s;oon recovered by the Engli&s;h, who, from a perfect knowledge of the place, made their way by a &s;ewer which led from the kitchen into the Tweed, and &s;urprizing the garri&s;on, put them all to death, in revenge for their cruelty on Ogle's troops.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">In the reign of Henry VI. 1460, the Scots gathered great booty on the Marches, and among many other ca&s;tles which they a&s;&s;ailed, <HI>Wark</HI> was taken and demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle was afterwards repaired by the Earl of Surry, and in the year 1523, in the 15th year of the reign of King Henry VIII. the Scotch army laying at Cold&s;tream, re&s;olved to attempt the reduction of <HI>Wark,</HI> under the command of the Duke of Albany, Sir John Li&s;le be|ing then Governor. Buchanan the Hi&s;torian, being pre&s;ent at the &s;iege, gives the following de&s;cription of the ca&s;tle: <Q>In the innermo&s;t area was a tower of great &s;trength and height; this was encircled by by two walls, the outer including a large &s;pace, into which the inha|bitants of the country u&s;ed to fly, with their cattle, corn, and flocks, in time of war; the inner of much &s;maller extent, but fortified more &s;trongly by ditches and towers. It had a &s;trong garri&s;on, good &s;tore of artillery and ammunition, and other things nece&s;&s;ary for defence.</Q> The Duke of Albany &s;ent again&s;t it battering cannon, and a cho&s;en band of Scots and French, to the number of 4000, under the command of Andrew Ker of Fairnher&s;t. The French carried the outer inclo&s;ure at the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault, but they were di&s;lodged by the garri&s;on &s;etting fire to the corn and &s;traw laid up therein. The be&s;iegers &s;oon recovered it, and by their cannon effected a breach in the inner wall. The French with great intrepidity mounted the breach, &s;u&s;taining great lo&s;s by the &s;hot of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the tower or keep, and being warmly re|ceived by the forces that defended the inner ballium, were obliged to retire after a great &s;laughter. The attack was to be renewed the &s;uc|ceeding day, but a fall of rain in the night, which &s;welled the Tweed, and threatened to cut off the retreat of the a&s;&s;ailants to the main army, and the approach of the Earl of Surry, who before lay at Alnwick with a large force, obliged the Duke to relinqui&s;h his de&s;ign, and repa&s;s the Tweed.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent remains of <HI>Wark</HI> do not in any wi&s;e &s;trike the traveller with an idea of &s;o formidable a fortre&s;s, as it a&s;&s;uredly was for many centuries. At what time it was di&s;mantled, and thus totally de&s;troyed, I have not been able to learn; but it is probable it was one of the &s;trong|holds ordered to be demoli&s;hed by King James VI. of Scotland, on his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England.</P>

By the e&s;cheats of the 1&s;t year of King Edward I. we find this place mentioned as the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>William de Cornhill.</HI> The <HI>ca&s;tle of Cornhill,</HI> I pre&s;ume, was the fort or tower, near Cornhill Bridge, and oppo&s;ite to <HI>Linnel Hou&s;e.</HI> The remains are &s;urrounded with a ditch, called the <HI>Ca&s;tle Stone Nich.</HI> It has been well &s;ituated for defending the pa&s;&s;age over the river. Here is a &s;eat hou&s;e of <HI>Henry Collingwood, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> commanding a view of the ground we had traver&s;ed on the north &s;ide of Tweed, extended to the Helton Moun|tains; and on the &s;outhern &s;ide of the river having a pro&s;pect of a wide country, over which many Gentlemen's &s;eats are di&s;per&s;ed, the whole clo&s;ed by a range of mountains, of which Cheviots are &s;upreme. In 1549, on an incur&s;ion of the Scots, they took the ca&s;tle of Cornhill, de&s;cribed as being an old hou&s;e of con&s;iderable &s;trength,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ridpath's Border Hi&s;tory.</NOTE> and a valu|able booty was gained.</P>
<P>In 1751, in pulling down Cornhill chapel, there was found, about three feet lower than the old foundation, a coffin of &s;tone, about eight feet long, in which were two urns of coar&s;e pottery, and the &s;hank bones and &s;cull of a per&s;on of great &s;ize.</P>
<P>South-ea&s;t of <HI>Cornhill</HI> is a remarkable encampment, but to what people or to what particular event they appertained, I have gained no certain information. The &s;everal lines are of great extent, but as they form no regular figure, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, do not merit a par|ticular de&s;cription: what is worthy of notice, is the mode in which the

works are defended, by ranges of conic eminences; a thing &s;ingular, and what rather confounds my judgment as to the antiquity of the place, and who were its occupants. Mr Wallis &s;ays they are &s;epulchral Tumuli; from which opinion I mu&s;t beg leave to di&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>In Branxton We&s;t Field is a column, placed as a memorial of the battle fought there on the 9th of September, in the 5th year of the reign of King Henry VIII. called the battle of <HI>Flodden Field,</HI> from the Scotch encampment on Flodden Hill. The di&s;po&s;ition of the Earl of Surry's forces was &s;uch, as to oblige the Scotch to come to an en|gagement, their retreat into their own country being cut off.</P>
<P>James IV. had wa&s;ted much time at <HI>Ford,</HI> captivated, as it is &s;aid, by the beauties of the daughter of <HI>Sir William Heron,</HI> &s;o as give the <HI>Earl of Surry</HI> time and opportunity for advancing towards the borders with a large army. The Scotti&s;h Nobles were aver&s;e to hazarding a battle, and &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on the policy of their return into their own country, loaded as they were with &s;poils, and having gathered many laurels in their campaign: but <HI>James,</HI> fired with re&s;entment at the challenges &s;ent by <HI>Surry,</HI> determined to engage the Engli&s;h, and for that purpo&s;e made choice of an advantageous &s;ituation for his army, in the neighbourhood of <HI>Ford.</HI> The eminence called <HI>Flodden,</HI> lays on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river <HI>Till;</HI> it is the la&s;t and lowe&s;t of tho&s;e hills that extend on the north-ea&s;t of the great mountain of Cheviot, towards the low grounds on the &s;ide of the Tweed; from which river, Flodden is di&s;tant about four miles: The a&s;cent to the top of it, from the &s;ide of the river Till, where it takes a northerly direction, ju&s;t by the foot of the declivity on which the ca&s;tle and village of Ford &s;tands, is about half a mile; and over the Till, at that place, there is a bridge. On the &s;outh of <HI>Flodden,</HI> lays the exten&s;ive and very level plain of <HI>Mil|field;</HI> having on its we&s;t &s;ide high hills, the branches of Cheviot; on the north, Flodden and other moderate eminences adjoining to it; on the &s;outh and ea&s;t, a tract of ri&s;ing grounds, nigh the foot of which is the &s;low and winding cour&s;e of the <HI>Till.</HI> The neare&s;t approach for the Engli&s;h army to <HI>Flodden,</HI> was through this plain, in every part whereof they would have been in full view of the Scots; where they had a great advantage in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an eminence, which on the &s;ide towards the Engli&s;h had a long declivity, with hollow and mar&s;hy grounds at its foot; while its crown contained &s;uch an extent of almo&s;t level ground, as would have &s;ufficed for drawing up in good order the forces that
<PB N="13" REF="15">
occupied it. <HI>Surry</HI> encamped on <HI>Wooler Haugh,</HI> on the 7th of Septem|ber, 1513, &s;ent a Herald with a challenge, to join battle in the plain the next day, between the hours of twelve and three. This challenge was dated the 7th of September, 5 o'clock in the afternoon, as appears by Stowe, p. 493. The names of the &s;ub&s;cribers were, <HI>Surry</HI> and his <HI>Son, Thomas Dacre, Clifford, Henry Scrope, Ralph Scrope, Richard Latimer, William Conyers, John Lumley, R. Ogle, William Percy, Edward Stanley, William Molineux, Marmaduke Con&s;table, William Ga&s;coyne, William Griffith, George Darcy, William Bulmer, Thomas Strangeways,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>James</HI> did not accept the challenge, but lay in his intrenchments, whil&s;t <HI>Surry</HI> ad|vanced his army near to <HI>Barmoor Wood,</HI> about two miles di&s;tant from the Scotch army, and lay there all night. A little hill on the ea&s;t of <HI>Ford,</HI> covered the Engli&s;h army from the ob&s;ervation of their enemies; whil&s;t, from this eminence, the Lord Admiral obtained a di&s;tinct view of all the Scotti&s;h army, and of all the eminences near it. The next morning the Engli&s;h made &s;ome marches to amu&s;e the enemy, and then gained the ground which cut off <HI>James</HI>'s retreat to Scotland. By this po&s;ition of his forces, <HI>Surry</HI> had an acce&s;s opened to the Scotti&s;h camp, much le&s;s difficult and dangerous than on the other &s;ide of <HI>Flod|den.</HI> The batteries rai&s;ed by the Scotch to command the Bridge of of <HI>Ford,</HI> of which the ve&s;tiges &s;till remain, were now rendered of no u&s;e. The Scots, deluded either by the treacherous advice of one <HI>Giles Mu&s;grave,</HI> who engaged the King's confidence, and abu&s;ed the royal ear, or depending that <HI>Surry,</HI> by his mode of marching the army, in|tended to gain <HI>Berwick,</HI> and avoid a battle, appeared now to be con|founded by the manoeuvres of the Engli&s;h, which be&s;poke their deter|mination to come to an engagement; in order to receive them with the greater advantage, and to gain the ground they &s;uppo&s;ed the Engli&s;h would attempt to po&s;&s;e&s;s, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the hill, the Scots &s;et fire to their huts on the ea&s;tern &s;ide, and made a motion to the we&s;t. The &s;moke being driven between the armies, concealed the progre&s;s the Engli&s;h were making, till they had almo&s;t gained the foot of the hill. <HI>Surry</HI> ob&s;erved the confu&s;ion his approach had occa&s;ioned among the Scotch troops, and finding the a&s;cent of the hill &s;hort and mode|rately &s;teep, determined not to delay the on&s;et.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h were di&s;po&s;ed in three divi&s;ions; the van under <HI>Thomas Howard,</HI> the General's elde&s;t &s;on, Lord Admiral of England, the right wing being led by <HI>Sir Edmund Howard,</HI> brother to <HI>Lord Thomas,</HI> and Knight Mar&s;hal of the army. The middle divi&s;ion, or main battle, was
<PB N="14" REF="16">
led by the <HI>Earl of Surry</HI> in per&s;on, and the rear by <HI>Sir Edward Stanley.</HI> The <HI>Lord Dacres</HI> commanded a body of re&s;erve, con&s;i&s;ting of hor&s;emen. The ordnance was placed in the front of the battle, and in the openings of the &s;everal divi&s;ions. After they had pa&s;&s;ed the little brook of <HI>Sandy|ford,</HI> the Lord Admiral perceiving the Scots approaching towards him, drawn up in four great bodies, armed with long &s;pears, like Moori&s;h pikes, &s;ent to his father the Agnus Dei that hung at his brea&s;t, as a token, accompanying a reque&s;t, that as the van of the army was not &s;ufficiently &s;trong or exten&s;ive to receive the brunt of the whole Scotti&s;h army, his father would bring up the forces of his divi&s;ion, and range them in a line with the van. The Engli&s;h General, convinced of the expediency of this di&s;po&s;ition, immediately came forward with his forces, and drew them up to the left of tho&s;e of his &s;on. The mode in which the Scots advanced to battle is variou&s;ly de&s;cribed: Paulus Jovius &s;ays, they were formed in five &s;quare bodies, &s;o that the third of tho&s;e in which the royal &s;tandard was erected, and all the chief men fought, was inclo&s;ed on each &s;ide by a double line, forming, as it were, two wings. Comparing the &s;everal accounts, it &s;eems mo&s;t probable that the battalia was thus arranged: The van of the Scotch army led on the right by <HI>Alexander Gordon Earl of Huntley,</HI> and on the left by the <HI>Earls of Crawford and Montro&s;e,</HI> and &s;ome &s;ay <HI>Lord Hume:</HI> the <HI>King</HI> was in the center or main body: a third divi&s;ion was commanded by the <HI>Earls of Lenox and Argyle</HI> with whom were <HI>Mackenzie, Maclean, and the Highlanders. Adam Hepburn Earl of Bothwell,</HI> with his kindred and clan, and the men of Lothian formed a body of re&s;erve. They had with them a large train of artillery. The Engli&s;h artillery began to play, which made a dreadful carnage, whil&s;t the Scotch cannon, from their high &s;ituation, took little or no effect, the &s;hot going over the heads of the Engli&s;h. This obliged the Scotch to advance, the <HI>Earls of Lenox and Argyle,</HI> to|gether with <HI>Lord Hume,</HI> moving with a body of ten thou&s;and &s;pearmen, &s;upported by &s;ome hor&s;e, down the hill towards <HI>Branxion,</HI> made a fierce attack on the wing commanded by <HI>Sir Edmund Howard.</HI> The &s;hock was violent, the Scots prevailed, and <HI>Sir Edmund</HI> was reduced to the la&s;t extremity, him&s;elf beaten to the ground the third time, and in im|minent peril of Death, when <HI>Lord Dacres, and Heron the Ba&s;tard,</HI> who had joined the Engli&s;h army with a troop of fierce outlaws, his fol|lowers, came in time to his re&s;cue. <HI>Sir Edmund,</HI> thus relieved, imme|diately joined the body commanded by his brother <HI>Lord Thomas,</HI> and they advancing again&s;t the <HI>Earls of Crawford and Montro&s;e,</HI> who&s;e troops were armed with &s;pears, put them to the rout, and both the Earls were
<PB N="15" REF="17">
&s;lain. On the other &s;ide of the field, <HI>Sir William Stanley,</HI> with the forces from Lanca&s;hire and Che&s;hire, being bowmen, forced the Scots to break their array, and de&s;cend to clo&s;er fight, in more even ground, where they were &s;oon thrown into confu&s;ion, and put to flight, after leaving the <HI>Earls of Argyle and Lenox</HI> with the &s;lain. The Engli&s;h attributed this &s;ucce&s;s to the archers, but the Scotch writers alledge, the mi&s;carriage of this part of their army was owing to the undi&s;ciplined ferocity of the Highlanders, who, animated by the &s;ucce&s;s of the attack made on that wing of the Engli&s;h army commanded by <HI>Sir Edmund Howard,</HI> could not be re&s;trained from ru&s;hing impetuou&s;ly forward, in an irre|gular and open manner, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ignals, cries, and menaces of the French Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>La Motte,</HI> who perceived the con&s;equence of &s;uch an improper and loo&s;e attack. <HI>The King</HI> of Scotland, who&s;e bra|very kindled to extravagance of courage at the perils which now &s;eem|ed to &s;urround him, deaf to every advice and remon&s;trance, pre&s;&s;ed forward, and expo&s;ed his royal per&s;on to all the dangers of the field: being &s;u&s;tained by <HI>Bothwell</HI> and his band, he charged on foot, at the head of the be&s;t of his troops, who&s;e armour re&s;i&s;ted the arrows of the Engli&s;h archery; he pre&s;&s;ed forward to the &s;tandards of the <HI>Earl of Surry,</HI> and with &s;uch ardour and valour, that they were nearly gained by this heroic phalanx: but at length the wings of the Scotch army being totally routed, all the Engli&s;h forces were employed again&s;t this valiant band, who were &s;urrounded by the coming in of <HI>Lord Dacre</HI>'s hor&s;e in the rear.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable body of Borderers, commanded by <HI>Lord Hume,</HI> &s;tood aloof during the mo&s;t arduous part of the battle; and when he was required by <HI>Huntley,</HI> to attempt the King's deliverance from the circle of his enemies, he an&s;wered, <Q>that the man did well that day that &s;tood and &s;aved him&s;elf.</Q> Before the battle the <HI>old Earl of Angus,</HI> anxious to di&s;&s;uade the King from engaging, was told by his Sovereign, <HI>that if he was afraid he might go home.</HI> The Earl judging it repugnant to his honour, to fight under the &s;tandard of a Prince from whom he had received &s;o great an affront, reque&s;ted he might be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;er|vice; but as pledges of his loyalty and firm attachment to <HI>James,</HI> left as ho&s;tages of his honour, a large body of kindred and dependents, with his two &s;ons, who both fell in the battle.</P>

"Thomas Howard Earl of Surry was knighted for his remarkable courage at the battle of Barnet; he was made Knight of the Garter 1 King Richard III. He was taken pri&s;oner at the battle of Bo&s;worth, and committed to the Tower by King Henry VII. and attainted by Parliament. King Henry a&s;ked him how he dur&s;t bear arms in behalf of that tyrant Richard? To which he an&s;wered, <Q>He was my crowned King, and if the parliamentary authority of England &s;et the crown upon a &s;tock, I will fight for that &s;tock; and as I fought then for him, I will fight for you, when you are e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;aid authority.</Q> In the rebellion again&s;t the King by the Earl of Lincoln, the Lieutenant of the Tower offered him the keys of the Tower, in order to &s;et him&s;elf at liberty; but he replied, <Q>that he would not be delivered by any power, but by that which had committed him.</Q> After he had been in pri&s;on three years and a half, the King gave him his liberty; and knowing his worth and nice &s;en&s;e of honour, took him into favour, and delivered up to him all his e&s;tates. The Earl took all occa&s;ions of relieving the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects, and was accounted one of the able&s;t and greate&s;t men in the kingdom. The Scots made an irruption into England, and be&s;ieged Norham Ca&s;tle: the Earl rai&s;ed the &s;iege, took the ca&s;tle of Ayton, and made all the country round a de&s;ert. James IV. of Scot|land, incen&s;ed at this, &s;ent a Herald with a challenge to him; to which he made a &s;en&s;ible and &s;pirited an&s;wer, <Q>that his life belonged to the King, whil&s;t he had the command of his army; but when that was ended he would fight the King on hor&s;eback or on foot; adding, that if he took the King pri&s;oner in the combat, he would relea&s;e him without any ran&s;om; and that if the King &s;hould vanqui&s;h him, he would then pay &s;uch a &s;um for his liberty, as was competent for the degree of an Earl.</Q> In the year 1501 the Earl was Lord High Trea&s;urer. In June, 1502, Margaret the King's daughter, a beautiful Prince&s;s, at the age of 14 years, was attended by the Earl of Surry, with a great company of Lords, Ladies, Knights, and E&s;quires, to the town of Berwick: &s;he was conveyed to St Lambert's church in Lamyr Moor, where King James, attended by the chief Nobility, received her, and carried her to Edinburgh. The next day after her arrival there, &s;he was with great &s;olemnity married unto him, in the pre&s;ence of all his Nobles. The King gave great entertainments to the Engli&s;h, whom the Scotch Noblemen and Ladies far out&s;hone, both in co&s;tly apparel, rich jewels, ma&s;&s;ive chains, habiliments &s;et with gold&s;mith's work garni&s;hed with pearl, and &s;tones of price, and in gallant and well-trapped hor&s;es. They made al&s;o great fea&s;ts for the Engli&s;h Lords and Ladies, and &s;hewed them ju&s;tling and other plea&s;ant pa&s;times, as good as could be devi&s;ed after the manner of Scotland. Divers Ladies of Queen Margaret's train remained in Scotland, and were after|wards well married to Noblemen. In 1507, two years before the death of King Henry VII. the Earl was Amba&s;&s;ador to the King of France; 2 King Henry VIII. he was made Earl Mar|&s;hal for life; in 1511 he was one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners at the Court of Arragon. When King Henry VIII. heard that the Scots were preparing to invade England, he &s;aid, <Q>that he had left a Nobleman who would defend his &s;ubjects from in&s;ults.</Q> After the battle of Flodden, the Earl him&s;elf pre&s;ented King James's armour to the Queen Regent. When the King re|turned from France, he gave the Earl an augmentation of his arms, viz. to bear on the bend the upper part of a red lion depicted in the &s;ame manner as the arms of Scotland, pierced thro' the month with an arrow. In 1514 the Earl was created Duke of Norfolk, and a grant was given him in &s;pecial tail of &s;everal manors. He hated and oppo&s;ed Cardinal Wol&s;ey, becau&s;e he advi&s;ed the King to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures hurtful to the liberties of the people: finding that his oppo&s;ition prevailed nothing, he re&s;igned his po&s;t, and retired from Court. He died in the year 1524.</P>

<P>William Bi&s;hop of St. Andrews was a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed youth, hand&s;ome, tall, and genteel, endued with excellent parts, great &s;weetne&s;s of temper, virtue, prudence, and liberality; he was &s;killed in the civil Law, Latin, Greek, and Mu&s;ic. The elegant pen of Era&s;mus, who was one of his Preceptors at Siena, in Italy, has &s;et his incomparable character in a mo&s;t ami|able 
<PB N="18" REF="20">light. By a di&s;pen&s;ation from the Pope, the King created him Archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews, 1509, and made him his Chancellor, 1511: he was al&s;o made the Pope's Legate at Latere.</P>
<P>It was not unu&s;ual, in ancient times, for the Dignitaries of the Church to attend their King in the wars; they were bound to do it by the feudal law. They held the temporalities of their benefices of the King as Barons, by the tenure of military &s;ervice. It appears from many grants to the Clergy, that according to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of Scotland, the clerical and military character were not incon&s;i&s;tent. King Edward III. 1368, ordered all the Clergy to take up arms.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="18"></NOTE> two other Scotch Prelates, four Abbots, twelve Earls, &s;eventeen Lords, four hundred Knights, and &s;eventeen thou&s;and others, among whom were many E&s;quires and men of note.

who were taken pri&s;oners. The royal body was not di&s;covered till the next day, when, in a circle of his &s;lain Nobility, he was found by <HI>Lord Dacres,</HI> who was well acquainted with his per&s;on. After the royal re|mains were removed to Berwick, Sir William Scott, Chancellor of Scot|land, and Sir John Foreman, pri&s;oners there, acknowledged the body of their late Sovereign. He was wounded in many parts, pierced al&s;o by &s;everal arrows; his left hand was almo&s;t &s;evered from the arm by two &s;everal wounds, and his neck was laid open to the middle. How un|fortunate was this race of Kings! James I. was murdered by the Earl of Athol, his uncle, in his palace. James II. died by the bur&s;ting of a piece of his own ordnance. James III. was &s;lain by rebels, headed by his own &s;on, James IV. who&s;e mi&s;erable death is above de&s;cribed. His body was embalmed at Berwick, and from thence conveyed to the mona&s;tery of <HI>Sheene,</HI> where, at the di&s;&s;olution, according to Stowe, it remained uninterr'd, and then thrown into a wa&s;te room among lumber.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>King James was killed in the 25th year of his reign, and the 39th of his age. He was of a maje&s;tic countenance, of a middle &s;ize, and a &s;trong body. By the u&s;e of exerci&s;e, a &s;lender diet, and much watching, he could ea&s;ily bear the extremities of weather, fatigue, and &s;car|city. He excelled in fencing, &s;hooting, and riding. He delighted in fine hor&s;es, the breed of which he endeavoured to propagate in his own country, as it appears from &s;everal letters &s;till extant, which he wrote to the Kings of Spain and Poland, entreating them that they would &s;uffer his &s;ervants to buy &s;uch hor&s;es and mares as their re&s;pective dominions afforded. In re|turn, he made them pre&s;ents of hunting dogs, and of the famous little ambling hor&s;es called galloways, bred in the mountains and i&s;les of Scotland. About the year 1508, the Lord of Campvere &s;ent him many fine large Flanders hor&s;es; and al&s;o King Henry VII. &s;everal fine hor&s;es and rich furniture. He was of a quick wit, which by the negligence of tho&s;e times was uncultivated with letters. He had great &s;kill in the art of curing wounds, which was then common to the Scotch Nobles, always in arms. He was of a high &s;pirit, of ea&s;y acce&s;s, cour|teous, and mild; ju&s;t in his judicial deci&s;ions, merciful in his puni&s;hments, which he inflicted upon offenders always unwillingly. He was poor, from his profu&s;ion in &s;umptuous buildings, public &s;hews, entertainments, and gifts.</P>
<P>As long as he lived he wore an iron chain girdle, to which he every year added one link, in te&s;timony of his &s;orrow for having appeared at the head of the rebels who killed his father, contrary to his expre&s;s orders. Bi&s;hop Le&s;ley concludes his Life of James with telling us, that the Scotch nation lo&s;t in him, a King mo&s;t warlike, ju&s;t, and holy. Certain it is, that he was &s;o dear to his &s;ubjects, that his death was more lamented than that of his predece&s;&s;or ever was.</P>
<P>He married Margaret the elde&s;t daughter of King Henry VII. by whom he left two &s;ons, the elde&s;t not two years old. About a year after King James's death, &s;he married Archibald Douglas Earl of Angus, by whom &s;he had a beautiful daughter, Margaret, born A. D. 1516, at Har|bottle Ca&s;tle, in Northumberland, afterwards the wife of Matthew Stewart Earl of Lenox, and by him mother to Henry Lord Darnley, father to King James I.</P>

<P><HI>St. Gregory</HI> in his letter to <HI>King Ethelbert</HI> in the year 601, had enjoined him to de&s;troy the heathen idols, their temples, and high places, that their influence might be taken away from the people, and their memory effaced. But on reviewing the e&s;tate of the inhabitants, their &s;uper&s;titions, and &s;ettled and habitual cu&s;toms, he thought it expedient not to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures &s;o violent and alarming at fir&s;t; and therefore in a letter wrote to <HI>Mellitus,</HI> an Abbot, who was upon his voyage to <HI>Britain,</HI> he orders him upon his arrival to inform <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> that on more mature deliberation, he had re&s;olved that the <HI>Pagan temples</HI> in Britain &s;hould not be pulled down, it being &s;ufficient that the <HI>Idols</HI> were taken away: therefore <HI>the places of the heathen wor&s;hip</HI> were to be purified with a libation of <HI>holy water, altars</HI> were to be erected therein, and <HI>relics</HI> placed under them; for if the&s;e <HI>temples</HI> were well built, it was fit the property of them &s;hould be altered, the wor&s;hip of Devils aboli&s;hed, and the &s;olemnities changed to the &s;ervice of the true God: that when the natives perceived tho&s;e religious &s;tructures remained &s;tanding, they might keep to the place without retaining the error; and be le&s;s &s;hocked upon their fir&s;t en|trance upon chri&s;tianity, by frequenting the <HI>temples</HI> they had been u&s;ed to e&s;teem. And his injunctions were, that &s;ince it had been their <HI>cu&s;tom</HI> to &s;acrifice oxen to the Devils they adored, this u&s;age ought to be refined on, and altered to an innocent practice. He recommends, that on <HI>the anniver&s;ary of the Saints</HI> who&s;e <HI>relics</HI> are lodged there, or upon the return of the day on which <HI>the church was con&s;ecrated,</HI> the people &s;hould erect booths about the churches lately re&s;cued from idolatry, provide a <HI>fea&s;t,</HI> and keep <HI>a chri&s;tian holiday:</HI> not &s;acrificing their cattle to evil &s;pirits, but killing them for their own refre&s;hment, and prai&s;ing God for the ble&s;&s;ing: and thus by allowing them &s;en&s;ual gratifications, they may reli&s;h chri&s;tianity the better, and be rai&s;ed by degrees to the more noble plea&s;ures of the mind; for unpoli&s;hed and ignorant peo|ple are not to be withdrawn from their habits all at once.

<P>In 1203, King John held a per&s;onal conference with William the Lion, King of Scotland, at this ca&s;tle, touching the demand made by the Scotch King of the northern counties; but nothing was determined, and King John returned in great di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the year 1209, King John came with a great army to Norham; the King of Scotland then a&s;&s;embling his troops at Roxburgh, a dread|ful war &s;eemed to be threatened, from King John's extravagant demands and vehement wrath again&s;t the Scotch; but by the intervention of the Nobility, the two Monarchs agreed to hold a conference for &s;ettling their di&s;putes, at Newca&s;tle; to which place the King of Scotland im|mediately repaired, attended by his brother David and a large train of Nobles; but being taken &s;uddenly ill, a truce was concluded on till his health was re&s;tored.

them to hold another conference at <HI>Norham,</HI> in the &s;ame year, when a treaty of peace was concluded between William King of Scot|land and King John, in which John &s;tipulated not to erect any fortre&s;s at Tweedmouth; William on the other hand depo&s;iting a large &s;um of money as re&s;titution for the ravages he had committed on the Engli&s;h borders.</P>
<P>In the year 1211, the two Kings held another conference at <HI>the ca&s;tle of Norham,</HI> at which Ermengard Queen of Scotland was pre&s;ent, and by her amiable conduct greatly promoted the treaty on which the So|vereigns had met. Here the terms of the former peace were ratified, and &s;everal new articles agreed to.</P>
<P>In the year 1213, King John, in the utmo&s;t terror of an in&s;urrection of his &s;ubjects and an inva&s;ion from France, in con&s;equence of the pa|pal interdict which had been pronounced, came again to <HI>Norham,</HI> earne&s;t to &s;ecure the amity of Scotland. William the Scotch King then lay dangerou&s;ly ill, and was not able to proceed further than Haddington on his engagement to meet the King of England. Highly chagrined at this di&s;appointment, he returned &s;outhward, and it was not long before his &s;entence of depo&s;ition was pronounced, his kingdom given to the king of France, and a croi&s;ade publi&s;hed again&s;t his territories by the Emi&s;&s;aries of the See of Rome. Driven to dreadful dilemma's, John was at length obliged to make his peace with the Holy See; the interdict, which had continued &s;ix years, was revoked, and the lands of tho&s;e who had adhered to the papal authority again&s;t their Sove|reign, and had been pronounced forfeitures to the Crown, of which tho&s;e of Eu&s;tace de Ve&s;ey were part, were re&s;tored. Soon after this event &s;ucceeded that glorious combination of the Barons, under which <HI>the great charter</HI> and <HI>charter of the fore&s;ts</HI> were obtained from the re|luctant hands of this mi&s;erable tyrant. <HI>To tho&s;e patriots, who&s;e names ought to be engraven on the hearts of every Briton, we owe every thing valuable upon earth, the liberty we po&s;&s;e&s;s, and our authentic right to the properties we enjoy.</HI> To men of the North, the memory of <HI>Eu&s;tace de Ve&s;ey, Richard de Percy, Robert de Ros, Peter de Bruis, Nicholas D'E&s;|toute&s;ille, William de Moubrai,</HI> and <HI>Oliver de Vaux,</HI> northern Barons in this combination, &s;hould be immortal.</P>
<P>By Hemingford, and under his authority by Knighton, it is alledged, that the violations and injuries the Barons had &s;u&s;tained, as well touch|ing
<PB N="31" REF="34">
their liberties and properties as in their private and family con|cerns, urged them to appear more readily in the promotion of this great work, the nece&s;&s;ity for which had indeed long been experienced. The ba&s;e tyrant was not content with public oppre&s;&s;ions, but in his mean|ne&s;s of vice, even de&s;cended to the violation of the wives and daughters of his Barons; to which purpo&s;e he practi&s;ed the vile&s;t artifices. He had by &s;tratagem po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the &s;ignet of <HI>Eu&s;tace de Ve&s;ey,</HI> by means of which he attempted to delude his Lady, that he might vio|late her cha&s;tity. Ve&s;ey by a happy di&s;covery gained a knowledge of the King's intentions, and concerting mea&s;ures with the Lady, had addre&s;s enough to put a common pro&s;titute into the arms of the tyrant, and pre&s;erve the honour of his family. Exulting in the &s;ucce&s;s of his project, and amid&s;t the fervour of a generous re&s;entment, he reproached the King to his face with his ba&s;ene&s;s, reviled him for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trumpet, and defied his wrath.</P>
<P>But to return to the hi&s;tory of Norham.&mdash;William King of Scotland dying, was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Alexander II. a youth not more than 15 years of age. The Barons of Northumberland had recour&s;e to him for protection, and thereupon paid their homage at <HI>Felton.</HI> This in|cen&s;ed King John &s;o much, that he prepared for a northern expedition. In the Year 1215, King Alexander came before <HI>Norham</HI> with a mighty army, and after an inve&s;titure for 40 days, was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege. This circum&s;tance is thus mentioned in Leland's Collectanea, v. 1. p. 535. <Q>Alexander King of Scottes, &s;un to King William, did entre ynto England, and did much de&s;pite to King John; he a&s;&s;egid the ca&s;tel of Mitteford and <HI>Norham,</HI> and toke homages.</Q></P>
<P>In 1258, King Henry III. had projected a &s;cheme for &s;urprizing Alexander III.

<P>A convention was appointed to be held at <HI>Norham,</HI> on the 10th day of May 1290, previous to King Edward the Fir&s;t's entering upon a de|ci&s;ion of the claims made by the &s;everal competitors for &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Crown of Scotland, on the death of Margaret of Norway, the in|fant heire&s;s.

The King declared, that the purpo&s;e of his coming was in quality of Superior and direct Lord of Scotland, to maintain the tranquillity of that kingdom, and to do impartial ju&s;tice to tho&s;e who laid claim to the Crown, but previous thereto he demanded their recognition of &s;uch his pretended &s;overeignty; and it is alledged, that his claim was hi&s;torically deduced with great &s;kill and artifice by <HI>Anthony Beck,</HI> then Bi&s;hop of Durham: after which three weeks were given for the Scotch Nobles to deliberate on the demand. On the 2d day of June then next, eight competitors, with &s;everal of the Prelates, Nobles, and Community of Scotland appeared, and held their council on this important matter, <Q>Congregatis ex oppo&s;ito ca&s;tri de Norham, ex alia parte fluminis Tweedae in quadam arda viridi,</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot Turri.</NOTE> when all the competitors made the required recognition, and ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of their &s;everal claims and pretended right to the Scotti&s;h Crown, to his deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day the competitors, together with the whole company, came to the King in the church of <HI>Norham,</HI> and &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent meetings were held there for &s;ettling preliminaries: and the &s;econd day of the &s;ucceeding Augu&s;t was appointed for hearing all claimants at Berwick.</P>
<P>After judgment was given at Berwick in favour of John Baliol, on the 20th of November 1292, he &s;wore fealty to King Edward in the ca&s;tle of <HI>Norham,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of many Nobles of both nations; and a commi&s;&s;ion was thence i&s;&s;ued for enthroning him at Scone.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36">In the following reign, in the year 1318, it was be&s;ieged by the Scots, Sir Thomas Grey being then Governor,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Leland's Collectanea, we have the following curious particulars of this &s;iege.</P>
<P><Q>The Scottes came yn to the Marches of England, and de&s;troyed the ca&s;tels of Werk and Herbotel, and overran much of Northumberland Marches.</Q></P>
<P>"At this tyme Thomas Gray and his friends defended Norham from the Scottes."</P>
<P><Q>It were a wonderful proce&s;&s;e to declare what mi&s;chefes cam by hungre and a&s;&s;eges by the &s;pace of XI yeres in Northumberland; for the Scottes became &s;o proude after they got Ber|wick, that they nothing e&s;teemed the Engli&s;hmen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>About this tyme there was a great fe&s;te made yn Lincoln&s;hir, to which came many Gentle|men and Ladies; and among them a Lady brought a heanlme for a man of were, with a very rich cre&s;te of gold, to William Marmion, Knight, with a letter of commandment of her Lady, that he &s;hould go into the daungere&s;t place in England, and there to let the heanlme to be &s;eene and knowne as famous. So he went to Norham; whither within 4 dayes of cumming, cam Philip Moubray, Guardian of Berwicke, having in his band 140 men of armes, the very flour of men of the Scotti&s;h Marches.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thomas Gray, Capitayne of Norham, &s;eying this, brought his gari&s;on afore the bariers of the ca&s;tel, behynde whom cam William richly arrayed, as al glittering in gold, and wear|ing the heanlme as his Lady's pre&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then &s;ayd Thomas Gray to Marmion, "Sir Knight, ye be cum hither to fame your heanlme, mount upon your hor&s;e, and ryde like a valiant man, to yown even here at hand, and I for&s;ake God, if I re&s;cue not thy body deade or alyve, or I my&s;elf will dye for it."</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whereupon he took his cur&s;ore, and rode among the throng of enemyes; the which layd &s;ore &s;tripes on hym and pulled hym at the la&s;t oute of his &s;adel to the ground.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then Thomas Gray with all the hole garri&s;on lette pryk yn among the Scottes, and &s;o wondid them and their hor&s;es, that they were overthrowen, and Marmion &s;ore beten was hor&s;id agayn, and with Gray per&s;ewid the Scottes in cha&s;e. There were taken 50 hor&s;es of price; and the women of Norham brought them to the foote men to follow the cha&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sir Thomas Gray hym&s;elfe killed one Cryne, a Fleming, an Admiral, and great robber on the &s;e, and yn hy favor with Robert Bru&s;e: the re&s;idew that e&s;caped were cha&s;ed to the Nunnes of Berwick.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Adam de Gordon, a Baron of Scotland, came with 160 men to dryve away the cattel pa&s;turing by Norham, but the young men of the country thereaboute encountered with them, whom Thomas Gray &s;eing to &s;tand in jepardy, wente oute with only 60 men, and killed mo&s;t parte of the Scottes and their hor&s;es.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The &s;ame Thomas was twi&s;e a&s;&s;iged yn the ca&s;tel of Norham by the Scottes, one tyme by the &s;pace almo&s;t of an yere, the other 7 monithes: his enuemies made fortre&s;&s;es before the ca&s;tel, one at Up&s;edlington, another yn the church of Norham. This ca&s;tel was twi&s;e vi|tailied by the Lord Percy and Neville, that he came with very noble men, and rich and great &s;ocorers of the Marches of England.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The utter ward of Norham Ca&s;tel was ons taken in Thomas Gray's tyme, on the vigill of St. Catherine, but they kept yt by 3 days, for theyr purpo&s;e in myning fayllied them.</Q></P></NOTE> by who&s;e brave de|fence, and the timely aid of the Lords Percy and Nevil, it was pre|&s;erved from the hands of the enemy. In order to carry on the &s;iege, the Scots rai&s;ed two forts again&s;t the ca&s;tle; one at the church of Nor|ham, and the other at Up&s;itlington. On a &s;ucceeding &s;iege in 1322, the Scots became ma&s;ters of this fortre&s;s, but held it not long, for King Edward retook it after an a&s;&s;ault of ten days, he having brought before it a very powerful army.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="37">In 1326, on the night of King Edward the Third's coronation, the Scots made an a&s;&s;ault on the ca&s;tle: Robert Manners then Governor had received previous intimation of the intended attempt, and permit|ting 16 of the a&s;&s;ailants to &s;cale the outward wall, put them to the &s;word.</P>
<P>In 1327, &s;oon after their march from Weardale, in the county of Durham, the Scots laid &s;iege to <HI>Norham,</HI> and took it by &s;torm. Three Knights of great military fame in the Scotch army fell in the attack, William de Montalt or Montraud,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert Bruce King of Scotland had a&s;&s;egid the ca&s;tel of Norham, wher Robert Maners was Capytane; which with his garri&s;on i&s;&s;uid oute one day, and di&s;comfited the Scottes, kill|ing William Monhaud, a Baron of Scotland.&mdash;Lel.

In 1355, a party of Scots under the command of Sir William Ram&s;ay burnt and plundered the town of Norham and adjacent country.</P>
<P>In the 13th year of the reign of King Henry VII. the Scots led by King James in per&s;on be&s;ieged <HI>Norham Ca&s;tle,</HI> which had been put into good repair by Fox, then Bi&s;hop of Durham, and was well garri&s;oned.

Some authors a&s;&s;ert the Scotch did not rai&s;e the &s;iege till the Earl of Surry with an army of 20,000 men came to its &s;upport, and obliged the a&s;&s;ailants to retire.

&s;hort &s;tate of their progre&s;s and proceedings in the Mers and Tiviot|dale. The progre&s;s of the Berwick garri&s;on was as far as Dungla&s;s: the garri&s;ons of Wark and Cornhill proceeded as far as the hills of Lammar Muir, and over the dry March of Tiviotdale. The chief Com|manders were Sir George Bowes, Sir Brian Laiton, and Sir Ralph Eure. On the 17th of July, Bowes, Laiton, and others burnt Dun&s;e, the chief town of the Mers; and John Carr's &s;on, with the garri&s;on of Cornhill Ca&s;tle, entered Greenlaw, and carried off a booty of cattle, &s;heep, and hor&s;es. On the 19th of the &s;ame month, the men of Tyndale and Rid&s;dale, returning from a road into Tiviotdale, fought with the Laird of Ferniher&s;t and his followers, and took him and his &s;on John pri&s;oners. On the 24th of July, the garri&s;on of Wark, the Captain of Norham, and Henry Eure burnt Long Edmin, made many pri&s;oners, and took a ba&s;tell-hou&s;e &s;trongly kept, and got a booty of 40 nolt and 30 hor&s;es, be&s;ides tho&s;e on which their pri&s;oners were mounted, each on a hor&s;e. On the 2d of Augu&s;t, the Captain of Norham burnt the town of Home, near to the ca&s;tle gates, with the &s;urrounding &s;teads. Sept. 6th, Sir Ralph Eure burnt Eikford church and town, the barnekin of Orme&s;ton, and won by a&s;&s;ault the Mo&s;s Tower, burnt it, and &s;lew 34 people within it: he likewi&s;e burnt &s;everal other places in that neigh|bourhood, and carried off more than 500 nolt and 600 &s;heep, with 100

hor&s;e load of &s;poils got in the tower. Sept. 27th, the men of the ea&s;t and part of the middle March, won the church of Eccles by a&s;&s;ault, and &s;lew 80 men in the abbey and town, mo&s;t part gentlemen of head &s;irnames; they al&s;o took 30 pri&s;oners, and burnt the abbey and town. On the &s;ame day the garri&s;on of Berwick brought out of the ea&s;t end of the Mers 600 bolls of corn, and took pri&s;oner Patrick Home, brother's &s;on to the Laird of Aiton. November 5th, the men of the middle March burnt Lu&s;&s;edden, in which were 16 &s;trong ba&s;tell hou&s;es, &s;lew &s;everal of the owners, and burnt much corn. November 9th, Sir George Bowes and Sir Brian Laiton burnt Dryburgh, a market town, all ex|cept the church, with much corn, and brought away 100 nolt, 60 nags, 100 &s;heep, and much other booty, &s;poilage, and in&s;ight gear.</P>
<P>The whole number of towns, towers, &s;teads, barnekins, pari&s;h churches, and ba&s;tell hou&s;es &s;eized, de&s;troyed, and burnt, in all the border country, was 192, Scots &s;lain 400, pri&s;oners taken 816, nolt 10,386, &s;heep 12,492, nags and geldings 1296, gayts 200, bolls of corn 850, in&s;ight gear an indefinite quantity.</P>
<P>In Hertford's expedition, places burnt, ra&s;ed, and ca&s;t down 129; among the&s;e Dun&s;e, the abbey and town of Eccles, the tower and bar|nekin of Ni&s;bit, the towers of Dun&s;e, Redbraes, Pollard, and Merting|ton, with the ca&s;tles of Wedderburn and Blackadder were ra&s;ed. On the river Tweed, from Kel&s;o upwards, 33 places were de&s;troyed; among which were the abbey of Kel&s;o, the abbey and town of Dryburgh, the abbey of Mailro&s;s, and the towers of Dawcove and Stotherick: on the river Tiviot 36; among which were the friars near Kel&s;o, the towers of Roxburgh and Orme&s;ton, and the two towers of Boon Jedburgh: 12 places on the Rowle Water: 13 on Jed; among which, the abbey, friars, and town of Jedburgh: 45 places on the Kayle, and between it and the Tweed: 19 on Bowbent (alias Bowmont).

<P>In the 22d year of the reign of King Henry VIII. <HI>Norham</HI> was &s;ur|prized by the Scotch, and &s;oon after recovered by one Franklin, Arch|deacon of Durham.</P>
<P>In the year 1551, a treaty was &s;igned in the church of Norham: the Scotch Commi&s;&s;ioners were Robert Bi&s;hop of Orkney, Robert Lord Max|well,
<PB N="38" REF="41">
Thomas Ma&s;ter of Er&s;kine, and Louis de St. Gelais, Lord of Lan&s;ac, Knt. tho&s;e for England were Thomas Bi&s;hop of Norwich, Robert Bowes, Leonard Beckwith, and Thomas Chaloner, Knt.</P>
<P>In 1552, <HI>the ca&s;tle of Norham,</HI> which from the time of Bi&s;hop Flam|bert had appertained to the See of Durham, appears from Lord Whar|ton's propo&s;als for the better protection of the Marches, to be ve&s;ted in the Crown. The deprivation of Cuthbert Tun&s;tal happened on the 11th of October in this year, &s;oon after the acce&s;&s;ion of Queen Mary, before which time we have no public record to &s;hew how Norham might come into the power of the Crown. The infamous law for the di&s;&s;olution of the bi&s;hopric, is the fir&s;t act of any notoriety I have been able to di&s;cover which could effect the matter: and notwith&s;tanding that law, it appears from &s;everal records that in the reign of Queen Mary the ca&s;tle was repaired and again fortified by Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tal; and that &s;ome very &s;hort time before his death, in the year 1559, he held a treaty there with the Scotch, when were pre&s;ent, Thomas Earl of Northumberland, William Lord Dacres of Gil&s;land, and Croft, Com|mander of the fortre&s;s of Berwick, on the behalf of the Engli&s;h; and for Scotland, the Earls of Morton and Hume, with the Dean of Gla&s;gow.</P>
<P>Camden de&s;cribes <HI>Norham Ca&s;tle</HI> in his time <Q>to be &s;ituate on the top of a high &s;teep rock, and fortified with a trench: the outward wall, of great circuit, was guarded by &s;everal turrets in a canton towards the river, in which another wall much &s;tronger encircled the keep or tower of great height.</Q> This de&s;cription gives a perfect idea of its figure, after the repairs made by Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tal. Towards the river the ruins now hang upon the very verge of the precipice, part of which, by the wa&s;hing of the torrent, has given way, and carried with it the &s;uper&s;tructure on that &s;ide; which with the decay incident to the length of time, has occa&s;ioned a wide breach in the outward wall &s;poken of by Camden: the turrets, as he is plea&s;ed to &s;tile them, appear to be no other than demi-ba&s;tions, a mode of fortification peculiar to the age in which this erection aro&s;e; a perfect model of which, &s;till in good pre&s;ervation, appears at <HI>Hartlepool,</HI> in the county of Durham, of near the &s;ame date, being the palatinate port of the bi&s;hopric.</P>
<P>The wall of the ca&s;tle of Norham, which extended from the water on the &s;outh &s;ide, was guarded with a gate-way and tower, having &s;quare turrets on each &s;ide, and thence a&s;cending the &s;teeps &s;tretching
<PB N="39" REF="42">
ea&s;tward, was al&s;o defended by another gate-way of &s;uperior dimen|&s;ions, fortified by two heavy round flanking towers, the remains of which are &s;till con&s;iderable. This appears to be the chief entrance, and fronts a plain of con&s;iderable extent: it was defended by a draw bridge over a very wide moat, which began here, and was extended round the land &s;ide of the ca&s;tle, enclo&s;ing a &s;pacious area or ballium, with a very &s;trong wall garni&s;hed with demi-ba&s;tions at intervals. Within the area of this outward wall are the remains of a chapel and &s;everal other &s;tructures. To defend the keep or main tower, a very &s;trong wall enclo&s;es a narrow area or interior ballium, which is entered by a gate|way, guarded on each hand by &s;quare towers. The keep is a very large heavy &s;quare building, vaulted underneath, like mo&s;t &s;tructures of this kind. Part of the vaults and &s;ome of the pri&s;ons remain entire, but all the interior parts of the tower above, are laid open and demo|li&s;hed. The remains of an exploratory turret are &s;een on one corner of the keep: it may be pre&s;umed it was originally uniform, bearing a turret at each corner. The height of the great tower is about 70 feet, containing four &s;tories or ranges of apartments. The whole build|ing is con&s;tructed of red free-&s;tone, of a &s;oft nature, and &s;ubject to decay. There is not the lea&s;t ornament about it, and the whole a&s;pect is gloomy to the greate&s;t degree: it wears the countenance of the times of King Stephen, without any embelli&s;hments of the age in which Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tal lived.</P>
<P>This has been a very formidable fortre&s;s, inacce&s;&s;ible from the Tweed; and before the u&s;e of fire arms, from its pre&s;ent remains ap|pears impregnable, if fully garri&s;oned, and duly provided with &s;tores again&s;t a &s;iege. When the outward walls were in repair, and filled with troops; when the oillets and other devices for the garri&s;on's fighting and defence were properly &s;upplied with experienced archers, and the ba&s;tions were kept by men of valour, it &s;eems almo&s;t incredible that this place could ever be taken by a&s;&s;ault. But when there was a re|gular blockade, and time for mining and rai&s;ing engines, the defence then con&s;i&s;ting of different manoeuvres, would con&s;equently harra&s;s the mo&s;t powerful garri&s;on; frequent &s;allies becoming nece&s;&s;ary, by which the troops are expo&s;ed to the &s;uperior numbers of be&s;iegers: ince&s;&s;ant watchings and &s;evere duties wear down the greate&s;t fortitude of &s;oul, and &s;carcity of provi&s;ion with perpetual anxiety &s;ubdue the mo&s;t vigo|rous heart.

<P><Q>Barrwick is the fir&s;t town by which I re-entered England, and be|ing a frontier to England, has been fortified in different manners: there is in it at pre&s;ent a large garri&s;on, as in a place of importance to this kingdom.

<P><HI>Opinions</HI> concerning the aboriginal form of <HI>human habitations</HI> in general, and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> in particular, founded upon the word BURROUGHS, by <HI>the Rev. Mr Conyers Place</HI> of Dorche&s;ter.</P>
<P>Burrough and its contraction <HI>Burgh</HI> (of which al&s;o I take <HI>Burrow, Barrow,</HI> and <HI>Bury</HI> to be &s;o many corruptions) is an allowed note of the antiquity of the place &s;o called, as well by <HI>Cambden</HI> him&s;elf as tho&s;e who are the authors of the annotations upon him; nor can there be a more effectual confirmation of that note, than that tho&s;e <HI>old</HI> and <HI>mother towns</HI> that have the privilege of &s;ending members to parliament, are particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by that name, and are called <HI>Burroughs,</HI> or allowed to be &s;o; the whole title of many of them to their pre&s;ent enjoyment of that right in the &s;tate of decay they are now reduced to, &s;eems to re&s;t in their claim to that title, and in the re&s;pect and veneration which the evidences of antiquity in&s;erted in that name be&s;peaks for them.</P>
<P>I cannot perceive that the name <HI>Burrough</HI> or <HI>Burgh,</HI> was in&s;tituted to denote any kind of eminence in the place &s;o called, beyond others, &s;o as to mean a <HI>Fort</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> or place any way fortified with ramparts, or otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed by any peculiar advantages, as is often &s;ugge&s;ted by <HI>Camden;</HI> or that the name puts the place called by it under any di&s;tinction what|ever, unle&s;s accidentally, be&s;ides that of common habitation, the bare antiquity of which it only implys, becau&s;e it is often confounded with &s;uch appellatives to a&s;certain and di&s;tingui&s;h it, as <HI>Burgh Ca&s;tle, Burgh Fort,</HI> &amp;c. and that it &s;ignifies no more than <HI>hou&s;e, hou&s;es, or a town,</HI> a &s;ettlement where one or more families dwelt. <HI>Burrough</HI> was the <HI>habitation,</HI> and <HI>Bour</HI> was the <HI>inhabitant,</HI> hence <HI>neighbour</HI> i. e. a <HI>nigh-bour</HI> or one that lived in a <HI>Burrough</HI> not far off.</P>
<P>But the name <HI>Burrough,</HI> though at fir&s;t it directly meant only one common habitation, yet carries in it monumental evidences of the original form of &s;uch habitation, and indirectly lets us into that: for our application of the name <HI>Burrough,</HI> to the habitation of &s;uch animals who&s;e natures are incapable of making improvements in their manner of dwelling that is &s;till retained among us, di&s;covers the native and &s;imple &s;ignification of the name <HI>Burrough,</HI> when our ance&s;tors gave their own dwellings that name; for we appropriate it only to the under|ground lodgings of animals, as to the holes of <HI>foxes, badgers,</HI> and <HI>rabbits.</HI> From whence I infer that when it was fir&s;t applied to human habitation, whether in an allu&s;ive &s;en&s;e from them, or their's from it; or whether both were &s;imple and equally original, that it &s;ignified the very &s;ame, or what nearly re&s;embled the habitations of tho&s;e creatures, and con&s;equently that the inhabitants of this land, when the name was given, dwelt chiefly underground, and lived not in hou&s;es rai&s;ed from the ground, but in holes dug in it, which &s;en&s;e of the word &s;eems &s;till to obtain as to the dead, though it has lo&s;t its native idea as to the living; for hence we may call putting a corp&s;e into a hole underground to <HI>bury</HI> or <HI>burrough it:</HI> a <HI>barrow</HI> or <HI>burrough</HI> being a place dug for that purpo&s;e, though the cu&s;tom of monumental tumulation has abu&s;ed the word to expre&s;s the contrary to what it was in&s;tituted to expre&s;s, and to &s;ignify a <HI>hill</HI> in&s;tead of a <HI>hole.</HI></P>
<P>Our original <HI>Burroughs</HI> in the primitive &s;implicity were but as &s;o many human warrens, con|&s;i&s;ting of a &s;et of underground caverns; the lodging part and body at lea&s;t of each dwelling run in, and was underground; and this is but &s;uitable to the &s;avage way of life of the old
<PB N="49" REF="52">Britons in other re&s;pects; &s;uch as their going naked, which alone cuts off all the ends almo&s;t of rai&s;ing hou&s;es: for to what end &s;hould men rai&s;e hou&s;es, who had neither cloaths nor fur|niture, nor wanted any guard again&s;t the inclemency of the air, nor had any intent of re|tirement to an&s;wer, but &s;ecurity from wild bea&s;ts, or noi&s;e whil&s;t they &s;lept? Their painted or rather &s;moke-bound hides, looked as if they lived in rooms where &s;moke had no vent by win|dows or chimneys; to which we may add, as an inducement to natural &s;implicity, that under|ground lodgings were both cooler in &s;ummer (if our clime is ever too hot) and warmer in win|ter; for which latter rea&s;on 'tis pretty near kept to in <HI>Iceland, Lapland,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Purchas</HI> &s;ays of the <HI>Icelanders,</HI> all their hou&s;es are under ground. Lib. 3. ca. 22.</P>
<P>Nor were the inhabitants of this i&s;land &s;ingular in this matter, &s;o no derogation to them, be|cau&s;e it &s;eems to have been Nature's primitive mode of dwelling, common with them to mo&s;t nations. The various notions of <GAP DESC="foreign">, of old, that took their names from the cu&s;tom of living in <HI>holes</HI> or <HI>burroughs,</HI> &s;trictly &s;uch, is an in&s;tance of it: hence it is that the <HI>old Giants</HI> are repre&s;ented to us as under-ground livers all of them, as <HI>Polyphemus's Cave, Cacus's Den,</HI> &amp;c. The ru&s;tic Divinities of the heathen, &s;uch as <HI>Pan, Faunus, the Satyrs,</HI> &amp;c. are propo&s;ed to us as re&s;iding in under-ground &s;eats, and your <HI>Sibylls, Trophonius,</HI> and the re&s;t of them, made choice of caverns to vent their oracles from, as more awful and venerable by their re&s;em|blance of primitive and &s;imple times, when <HI>heaven and earth</HI> corre&s;ponded together more fami|liarly; and I am apt to think, that the notion of your <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <HI>Terrae Filii,</HI> men &s;pringing out of the earth, did ari&s;e hence; and that a great many &s;uddenly bolting out at once from their <HI>burroughs,</HI> like the <HI>Tinners</HI> in Cornwall from their mines, might fir&s;t give occa&s;ion to tho&s;e fables and fancies, of crops of armed troops &s;tarting up from dragons and &s;erpents teeth, to the great &s;urprize of <HI>Cadmus and Ja&s;on.

<P>After the <HI>deluge,</HI> the terror it had &s;truck, and the fear of its return, made men keep chiefly to the mountains, as the &s;afe&s;t: be&s;ides that, the plains and flat countries mu&s;t be all &s;o mixed, and thereby puddled, that a century would &s;carce harden and &s;ettle them again &s;ufficiently for &s;afe and convenient habitation; for till the waters had wrought them&s;elves drains, after &s;uch a thorough blend, they mu&s;t be drawn off very lei&s;urely, and when the fertility of the plains invited them down, the di&s;tru&s;t of the floods returning, fir&s;t put them upon building upwards from the level; of which new project <HI>Babel</HI> &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t in&s;tance, followed by others built after the &s;ame new mode by <HI>Nimrod,</HI> in the plain of <HI>Shinar,</HI> nor does it appear that any &s;uch thing had been practi&s;ed before by the antediluvians; and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s way of men|tioning that piece of architecture does intimate the project to have been entirely new, and that the tower or town of <HI>Babel</HI> was the fir&s;t building that men had rai&s;ed above ground for habita|tion; for <HI>Cain</HI>'s building of a <HI>city</HI> may be accounted for by forming a &s;ociety only, or &s;urround|ing the place where he dwelt with trenches, ramparts, or fortifications, &s;uch as his fears put him upon, and does not determine it to any mode of building. Digging downward for habita|tion, both before and long after the flood, appears to have been the common and general prac|tice, and Nature's fir&s;t genuine method, which men departed from either through di&s;tru&s;t or ignorance of God's providence, le&s;t there &s;hould be a &s;econd deluge; or as the fear of wild

<P>The be&s;t therefore that we can &s;uppo&s;e of our top <HI>Briti&s;h man&s;ions and towns,</HI> when the name of <HI>borroughs</HI> was impo&s;ed on them, in the barbarous &s;tate the inhabitants were then in, is, that they came up to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uts</HI> of the <HI>Hottentots,</HI> or <HI>Indian Savages,</HI> or other uncultivated tribes of men: and if their hou&s;es &s;tood above ground, yet they were &s;uch <HI>conge&s;ta culmina <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;pite,</HI> or extempore hovels, as our beggars now but make again&s;t banks of the road &s;ide; one degree removed from &s;ubterranean, if at all: they lived under earth, if not under ground; and indeed what are our hou&s;es &s;till, but &s;upplemental caves above ground?</P>

<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> indeed repre&s;ent the <HI>Britons,</HI> when they found them, as living in <HI>huts of reeds or wood,</HI> and their <HI>towns</HI> as &s;o many <HI>woods;</HI> but the <HI>Britons,</HI> who knew them&s;elves be&s;t, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, without rea&s;on and propriety, to have given a name to their habitations, that &s;peaks them to have been of another nature; again&s;t which no foreign te&s;timony can &s;o far pre|vail, as to make us think otherwi&s;e, but that in &s;ome period of time or other, either then, be|fore, or &s;ince, the inhabitants notions of dwelling were agreeable to what that name expre&s;&s;ed, and that con&s;iderable di&s;po&s;itions were made actually among them&s;elves accordingly.</P>
<P>The name <HI>burrough</HI> appears to have travelled hither from <HI>Germany</HI> and the <HI>North,</HI> whence we were fir&s;t peopled, and where a great many of their olde&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable towns carry <HI>burgh</HI> and <HI>burrough</HI> in their name; and the thing it&s;elf, in the colder climates, as I have hinted, is pretty near kept up to. The infamous cu&s;tom of <HI>ince&s;tuous community of wives,</HI> which <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> takes notice of among the <HI>Britons,</HI> and &s;ays they had ten or twelve of them wives together in common, e&s;pecially brothers with one another, and parents with their children, very well agrees with <HI>burrough living;</HI> for families cohabiting in one common room together, without partition, and that &s;uited &s;uch works of darkne&s;s, mu&s;t of cour&s;e fall by that means into &s;uch

<P>The invention of this tenure of <HI>Burrough Engli&s;h,</HI> has likewi&s;e rai&s;ed a thought in my head con|cerning the etymology of the name <HI>England</HI> it&s;elf, that falls in with what I have &s;aid of <HI>burroughs,</HI> from an old word &s;till in u&s;e in the North, which is <HI>angle,</HI> and &s;ignifies a hole that runs under ground, on the branch of a mine. From the old word that worm takes its name, who&s;e u&s;e for baits has given the name of angling when we fi&s;h with it, it is not unlikely but the name of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Angle-land</HI> might al&s;o come from living in &s;ubterraneous caverns, a <HI>burrough</HI> differ|ing from an <HI>angle,</HI> as a part from the whole, a <HI>hou&s;e</HI> from a <HI>town,</HI> or one <HI>room</HI> from a <HI>hou&s;e.</HI> If we &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>burroughs,</HI> like the <HI>cave of Machpelah,</HI> double,<NOTE N="&dagger;">Gene&s;is. ch. xxiii. but there is nothing &s;aid of its being dou|ble there.</NOTE> that is running in &s;everal ways from one common mouth, &s;o that <HI>Eng|li&s;hmen,</HI> was as much as to &s;ay <HI>Burroughmen</HI> or <HI>cavern-livers,</HI> the very &s;ame as <GAP DESC="foreign">, which example makes it more likely, and which I think is a much better conjecture than from <HI>Angulus,</HI> or their living in a corner, or from <HI>angling,</HI> or from <HI>Angelus,</HI> the &s;tory of the Pope's admiring the Engli&s;h boys; which <HI>paultry</HI> etymologies yet are thought worthy of a place in our Antiquities.

<P>The accounts given of the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es of King Edward are various, and authors differ much in regard to the &s;laughter which attended them. The King being encamped near the <HI>nunnery,</HI> offered terms of peace, which after being demurred upon for two days, were rejected by the garri&s;on. On the next day, being Thur&s;day after Ea&s;ter, A.

times, on the like occa&s;ions. The navy perceiving the di&s;play of ban|ners from the mouth of the Tweed, where the fleet then lay, and pre|&s;uming the attack was beginning, anxious to win part of the laurels of the day, pu&s;hed over the bar, and gained the haven; by which three &s;hips were lo&s;t, having &s;tranded, where they were burnt by the town&s;|men: the re&s;t were &s;carce able to e&s;cape in the ebb tide. King Edward de&s;irous to &s;ave his fleet, ordered an immediate attack, whil&s;t the chief part of the garri&s;on was employed in defending the town neare&s;t the haven. He is charged by Fordun and other Scotti&s;h writers with u&s;ing a delu&s;ive artifice, in detaching a body of men, under the cover of &s;ome ri&s;ing grounds, to gain an approach on another quarter, and by di&s;|playing Scotch colours, induce the garri&s;on to permit their advanc|ing near the fortifications, under a pre&s;umption that they were a rein|forcement for the town. The Engli&s;h authors take no notice of this &s;tratagem. It appears from the be&s;t authorities, that the fortifications of this place, at that time, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of a ditch, and a rampier of earth with a barricado of timber: through the&s;e the Engli&s;h army made their entrance with very little difficulty, and the garri&s;on and in|habitants, a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;uddenne&s;s of the event, and overwhelmed by &s;uperior force, were &s;laughtered without much re&s;i&s;tance. The chief oppo&s;ition that was made, was by 30 Flandrian Merchants, who held out a &s;trong tower, called the <HI>Red Hall,</HI> till the evening, when fire be|ing &s;et to it, the building was con&s;umed, and all within peri&s;hed. In the reduction of this tower, the brother of the <HI>Earl of Cornwall,</HI> a va|liant Knight, was &s;lain by a &s;pear's piercing his eye, as he looked up to tho&s;e who fought above. All the gentlemen and fighting men of Fife are &s;aid to have been put to the &s;word. The <HI>ca&s;tle,</HI> commanded by <HI>William Douglas,</HI> &s;urrendered the &s;ame day, and its garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of 200 men, were permitted to march out armed, on &s;wearing from thenceforth not to fight again&s;t the King or kingdom of England; but their Governor was detained a pri&s;oner. Fordun &s;ays the number of &s;lain was 7500; that the &s;treets ran with blood two days, and in &s;uch quantities as to make mills go. Boetheus &s;ays al&s;o the &s;lain were about 7000 in number, and &s;ays that mills were actually &s;et a-going with the blood. Matthew We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;ays, that all were &s;lain, without di&s;tinc|tion of &s;ex or age, in number 60,000. In the in&s;tructions from the Regency and Council of Scotland, to their Procurators at Rome, A.

<P>In the year 1310, King Edward II. his Queen, and Nobles, &s;pent their winter at Berwick; the King returning thither from his Scotch expedition.

<P><HI>Sterling Ca&s;tle</HI> had &s;u&s;tained a long &s;iege and blockade, and the Go|vernor was at length obliged to accede to certain articles, under which, if this fortre&s;s was not relieved before an appointed day, it was to be &s;urrendered to <HI>Bruce:</HI> King Edward determined to march to its relief, and with all po&s;&s;ible expedition moved his army from Berwick. <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> informed of the intention of the Engli&s;h Monarch, re&s;olved to abide the event of a battle, rather than rai&s;e the &s;iege. He had viewed the ground, and fixed upon a part near the ca&s;tle, where he &s;hould have only ju&s;t &s;ufficient room to mar&s;hal his troops with advantage, accord|ing to their arms. This place was defended on the one hand by in|acce&s;&s;ible rocks, and on the other by a mora&s;s, having the water of Bannokburn in front. King Edward being informed the country near Sterling was full of mora&s;&s;es, and difficult to be pa&s;&s;ed, &s;o that his hor&s;e could not be of the &s;ervice he wi&s;hed, he levied a reinforcement of foot, 4000 from York&s;hire, 2500 from Northumberland, 1500 from Durham, and 2000 from Derby and Nottingham. In the advance the army was divided into ten columns, 10,000 men in each, commanded by leaders of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed character; the <HI>Earls of Glouce&s;ter and Hereford</HI> led the van, the center was led by the <HI>King</HI> in per&s;on, <HI>Sir Giles D'Argentein</HI> and <HI>Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke,</HI> Generals un|der him. The army under the&s;e divi&s;ions, is &s;aid to have covered a large tract of country, and was a &s;ight augu&s;t and &s;olemn; the whole &s;cene made re&s;plendent, by burni&s;hed arms and di&s;played en&s;igns.</P>
<P>As the Engli&s;h approached, <HI>Bruce</HI> led his troops to occupy the cho&s;en ground, on the Saturday before the battle. To &s;trengthen the &s;tation, he cau&s;ed pits to be dug in front, armed with pointed &s;takes within, covered with hurdles or flakes, and concealed by turfs and ru&s;hes. On the morning of Sunday, being Mid&s;ummer Eve, <HI>Bruce</HI> with his Lords and Chieftains attended &s;olemn devotions and ma&s;s in the front of the army; and the Prie&s;ts went through the ranks, exhorting each &s;oldier <Q>to exert his powers for the relief of his country, and rather die a martyr in the virtuous cau&s;e, than &s;ee the Engli&s;h again become ty|rannical ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, as they had been in the time of King Edward I.

of dete&s;ted memory.</Q> Such arguments and exhortations &s;erved to inflame the Scotch army with enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardour. The Engli&s;h were ordered to advance &s;o near <HI>Bruce</HI>'s &s;tation; on Sunday evening, that though harra&s;&s;ed with a tedious march, they were obliged to lay under arms all night, for fear of a &s;urprize. This evening was not without &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes and re-encounters, in which the Engli&s;h were wor&s;ted: in one of the&s;e <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> engaged and &s;lew <HI>Sir Henry Boynton;</HI> cleav|ing his head with a battle ax. A party of 300 hor&s;e, under the com|mand of <HI>Lord Robert Clifford</HI> and <HI>Henry Beaumont,</HI> attempting to gain the ca&s;tle, were engaged by a cho&s;en band of Spearmen, led by <HI>Earl Murray,</HI> and put to the rout: <HI>Sir William Dayncourt</HI> was &s;lain, and <HI>Thomas Gray</HI> made pri&s;oner;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the Scotch army on the day of battle was in four divi&s;ions: <HI>Sir Thomas Randolph</HI> commanded the van, <HI>Edward Bruce</HI> the right wing, and <HI>Sir James Douglas</HI> the left; <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> was with the body of re&s;erve or rear. The Scotch were all on foot, that by ma|king the danger and di&s;tre&s;s of the engagement equal, the ardour of each might by example be exhilerated. The &s;oldiers of the body of re|&s;erve, were covered with light coats of mail, which a &s;word could not penetrate: they carried an ax in the belt, and lances in their hands. Malm&s;bury de&s;cribes the Scotch army moving, "as thick as a hedge." The leaders were men of that &s;kill and valour, that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the confidence of the troops. In the Engli&s;h army, the foot, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;pearmen and archers, were in the van, the hor&s;e were on each flank; and in the&s;e po&s;itions the armies engaged.</P>
<P>The on&s;et was vigorous and well maintained on both &s;ides. The <HI>Earl of Glouce&s;ter</HI> commanded that part of the line which was attacked by <HI>Sir James Douglas's</HI> corps, con&s;i&s;ting of 7000 Borderers and 3000 Iri&s;h Scots or Katerans, vulgarly called Red&s;hanks, a fierce and valiant race. The Engli&s;h, unable to &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock, began to give way, when the Earl, impatient of di&s;grace and inflamed with ire, accompanied by a cho&s;en band, ru&s;hed into the thicke&s;t of the foes, where he was beaten from his hor&s;e and &s;lain. The covered pits deterred or fru&s;trated his Knights from effecting his re&s;cue. Malm&s;bury &s;ays, with great warmth,

The Engli&s;h archers, who had &s;o often carried victory with them in former conflicts, were attacked in flank, and put to the rout, by a troop of light cavalry clo&s;e armed, who were remounted for this critical &s;ervice, and led by <HI>Sir Robert Keith,</HI> Mar&s;hal of Scotland. The confu&s;ion among the archers, and the fall of &s;uch eminent leaders, &s;truck the Engli&s;h army with a panic, which was not a little increa&s;ed by the &s;ight of a large body of men advancing over the &s;ummit of a di&s;tant eminence, who were no other than the attendants on the carriages and baggage, drawn up in martial array, and di&s;playing pieces of linen on the ends of &s;pears, which at that di&s;tance appeared like a crowd of banners. Confu&s;ion and uproar &s;oon took place, and the Engli&s;h Monarch was advi&s;ed to &s;ecure his retreat, as Victory was declaring on every hand for <HI>Bruce,</HI> and the Engli&s;h forces, wearied and fainting, were giving way. The King with great reluctance and &s;hame con&s;ented to move the royal &s;tandard, the &s;ight of which compleated what the valour of the Scotch phalanx had &s;o gloriou&s;ly begun: the rout became general, and mul|titudes fell as well under the &s;word in the pur&s;uit, as in the waters of <HI>Bannockburn</HI> and <HI>Forth.</HI> The effu&s;ion of blood was greatly &s;pared, by the avarice of plunder, the rich baggage of the Engli&s;h army affording immen&s;e booty to the victors. Of the Scots, only two leaders of note fell, <HI>William Vipont</HI> and <HI>Walter Ro&s;s.</HI> Seven hundred Engli&s;h Gentle|men were mi&s;&s;ing after the battle, the greate&s;t part of whom were among the pri&s;oners. <HI>Sterling</HI> &s;urrendered to the King of Scotland, who ordered the fortifications to be de&s;troyed to their foundations.

<P>King Edward with a body of hor&s;e fled towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> pur&s;ued by <HI>Sir James Douglas</HI> with a party of light cavalry, who effected no|thing but taking up a few &s;tragglers, who fell off from the King's troop.

The Scotch King <HI>Robert Bruce</HI> &s;oon after arrived, and with his Court re&s;ided &s;ome time in the ca&s;tle. He made his &s;on-in-law, <HI>Walter, Steward of Scotland,</HI> Governor, who, ambitious of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;ettlement on the borders, where he might di&s;play his youthful courage, called out 500 Gentlemen his dependents, with others of inferior rank, &s;kilful in &s;hooting with bows and working engines, for the more effectual defence of the place. <HI>Sir John Crab,</HI> a Fleming, of high reputation in his art, was made chief Engineer.</P>
<P>King Edward, in the &s;ucceeding year, prepared to recover <HI>Berwick,</HI> and on the fir&s;t of September approached with a large body of troops, having with him <HI>Lanca&s;ter, Pembroke, Arundell, Hertford, Warren,</HI> and the <HI>Earl Mar&s;hal</HI> the King's brother, <HI>Hugh D'E&s;pencer, Roger de Tam|mori,</HI> and <HI>Hugh Deudeley,</HI> parceners to the earldom of Glouce&s;ter, by marriage of the coheire&s;&s;es, the late Earl's &s;i&s;ters. This force was ac|companied by a fleet from the cinque ports, laden with provi&s;ions and all kind of &s;tores. The Engli&s;h fortified their camp, and then pro|ceeded to an a&s;&s;ault. The walls of the town are de&s;cribed to be &s;o low, that an a&s;&s;ailant might &s;trike the people that defended them, with a &s;pear. On the &s;eventh of September they attempted an e&s;calade, at dif|ferent parts in the &s;ame time, and a &s;hip was directed to approach with an engine, to attempt the walls on the &s;ide next the haven; but all

the&s;e were fruitle&s;s, the &s;hip was left on ground by ebb of tide, and burnt by the garri&s;on. In the next general a&s;&s;ault, which was made on the 13th of September, the Engli&s;h employed a great machine called a <HI>Sow,</HI> con&s;tructed for holding and defending men, who were moved in it towards the foot of the wall, in order to undermine and &s;ap its foundation. Devices were u&s;ed to burn this machine, but by throwing a &s;tone of va&s;t weight from an engine, the Sow was &s;plit, and her oc|cupiers di&s;lodged. On an attack of <HI>Marygate,</HI> the draw bridge was burnt, and the gate in great danger; but forces from the ca&s;tle coming to its defence, the a&s;&s;ailants were obliged to retire. The&s;e efforts har|ra&s;&s;ed and weakened the garri&s;on con&s;iderably, and the town mu&s;t on another a&s;&s;ault, have fallen into the hands of the Engli&s;h, if Lanca&s;ter had not withdrawn his forces from the camp, exerci&s;ing his malignant &s;pirit at this critical time again&s;t the King, whom he hated mo&s;t inve|terately.

The Scots knowing the reduction of this place would be one of the fir&s;t and chief enterprizes of their adver&s;a|ries, to the utmo&s;t of their power put it in a &s;tate of defence, to re&s;i&s;t the great &s;hock they pre&s;umed it would nece&s;&s;arily &s;u&s;tain: they filled it with a garri&s;on of cho&s;en veterans, and made <HI>Sir William Keith</HI> gover|nor of the <HI>town,</HI> and <HI>Patrick Earl of Dunbar</HI> the keeper of the chief fortre&s;s or citadel. The King &s;oon arrived, and remained in per&s;on before the walls about a month, when perceiving from the &s;trength of the garri&s;on, and the vigorous defence they made, that it would not be ea&s;y to reduce the place, he marched part of his army into Scot|land, carrying the horrid ravages of war as far as <HI>Scone, Dundee,</HI> and <HI>Dumbarton.</HI> The mo&s;t &s;avage cruelties mark tho&s;e times; the wild American never devi&s;ed more &s;hocking barbarities than &s;tained the&s;e borders; each nation was ingenious in torture, in modes of deva&s;tation, and in the pro&s;ecution of revenge. Having glutted their avarice of blood, and being loaded with pillage, they again returned to <HI>Berwick,</HI> which King Edward &s;till found un&s;ubdued. After receiving reinforce|ments, he declared his determination was either to be ma&s;ter of <HI>Ber|wick,</HI> or effect &s;omething of con&s;equence, by bringing his adver&s;aries to battle. The &s;iege was changed into a &s;trict blockade: the be&s;ieged di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the cutting off &s;upplies, made many &s;allies, with various fortune; they made a vigorous attack upon the fleet, and mo&s;t of the navy then before <HI>Berwick</HI> was burnt. The garri&s;on &s;till entertained hopes of relief, and refu&s;ed to capitulate, pre&s;uming this key to the kingdom, was of too great con&s;equence to the Scotch, at that time to be neglected, and &s;uffered to fall into the hands of the enemy. <HI>Lord Douglas</HI> had levied a powerful army, with which he marched to the neighbourhood of <HI>Berwick;</HI> but to the great di&s;tre&s;s of the garri&s;on, who believed their day of deliverance was at hand, in&s;tead of attacking the Engli&s;h, <HI>Douglas</HI> cro&s;&s;ed the Tweed, and in &s;ight of the town, marched along the coa&s;t towards <HI>the ca&s;tle of Bambrough,</HI> which being e&s;teemed impregnable, was cho&s;en by the King of England, as a &s;ecure re&s;idence for his Queen. The Scotch wa&s;ted &s;everal days in blocking up that fortre&s;s, and ravaging the adjacent parts, hoping that King Edward's &s;ollicitude for his Queen, would induce him to rai&s;e the &s;iege of <HI>Berwick.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71">The device which had been practi&s;ed with effect in the year 1318, did not now take place; King Edward was not to be moved from his determined purpo&s;e; the garri&s;on reduced to extremities for want of provi&s;ions, and di&s;pirited by the apparent neglect of <HI>Douglas,</HI> propo&s;ed a treaty, which King Edward readily attended to, and the capitulation was concluded on the 15th day of July, under the following condi|tions: That the <HI>town</HI> and <HI>ca&s;tle</HI> &s;hould be &s;urrendered to King Edward on the 20th, if not relieved with 200 men at arms, or by a battle; that in the interval, there &s;hould be a ce&s;&s;ation of arms; that in ca&s;e of a &s;urrender, the lives and properties of the garri&s;on and inhabitants &s;hould be protected, with liberty to &s;uch as were &s;o inclined to leave the place; and that the Governor &s;hould have &s;afe conduct granted him to the Scotch army, to communicate the articles. <HI>Sir William Keith</HI> re|paired to the Scotch camp without delay, and there prevailed that an attempt &s;hould be made to relieve the place: a mea&s;ure totally di&s;ap|proved by &s;ome of the olde&s;t and mo&s;t experienced of the Scotch leaders.</P>
<P>In this interval, a tran&s;action is &s;aid to have taken place, which &s;ullies the lu&s;tre of Edward's military character, and &s;tamps an odium on his memory; it &s;tands recorded to the following effect, by Bucha|nan, Boece, and other Scotch authors of great credit.</P>
<P>Ho&s;tages were given by the Scots, for performance of their part of the treaty, one of whom was the elde&s;t &s;on of <HI>Sir Alexander Seeton,</HI> who was Deputy Governor, and took command on <HI>Keith's</HI> re&s;orting to the camp. King Edward had al&s;o in his camp <HI>Seeton</HI>'s younger &s;on, taken a pri&s;oner at the a&s;&s;ault made on the navy. The King apprehending that by the approach of the Scotch army, he might probably be de|prived of the capture of Berwick, an object of &s;o great importance, &s;oon after the departure of <HI>Keith,</HI> contrary to the faith of Princes, the &s;acredne&s;s of treaties, the common policy of nations, and all private honour, demanded an immediate &s;urrender of the place; threatening if <HI>Seeton</HI> refu&s;ed, that he would immediately hang up his two &s;ons, the ho&s;tage and the pri&s;oner, before the walls. <HI>Seeton</HI> remon&s;trated, but Edward regardle&s;s of all the charges made again&s;t him for the violation of public faith, cau&s;ed a gibbet to be erected in full view of the town, to put in execution his infamous threat. <HI>Seeton</HI> &s;truggling between honour and parental feelings, between duty to his country and love
<PB N="69" REF="72">
for his children, &s;uffered all the pangs ari&s;ing from a conflict, in which every &s;entiment was on the rack: Nature would have prevailed, and <HI>Seeton</HI>'s children been &s;aved by a &s;acrifice of his country's honour and his own, had not the mother, with all the virtue and heroi&s;m of a Roman matron, and the greatne&s;s of the mo&s;t exalted mind, argued forcibly to &s;upport his principle, and &s;u&s;tain his fainting &s;oul; and when yet he &s;eemed to relax, &s;he withdrew him from the horrid &s;pec|tacle, that he might retain his rectitude, though his &s;ons were the in|e&s;timable price by which it was maintained. Edward unrelenting, put them to death, and <HI>Seeton</HI> kept the town.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action is denied by the Engli&s;h Hi&s;torians, who affirm that the Scotch army came in fight before the truce was expired; and there|fore Edward could have no pretence for demanding a &s;urrender.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Smollet, vol. 2. p. 19.</P>
<P>Tyrell &s;ays, on expiration of the truce mentioned by Boece and Buchanan, King Edward &s;ummoned the town to &s;urrender; to which Seeton replied, he could not con&s;ent thereto, as he had a&s;&s;urances of &s;peedy relief. The King in&s;i&s;ted on the terms of the truce, by which the &s;urrender was &s;tipulated, and the time was now expired. Seeton &s;till refu&s;ed, would have pre|varicated and argued; which &s;o incen&s;ed the King, that by advice of his Council he executed one of Seeton's &s;ons. This act is &s;aid to have induced the town&s;men who&s;e &s;ons were ho&s;tages, to &s;olicit new terms, and additional days for ce&s;&s;ation of arms, which King Edward granted.</P>
<P>It does not appear that Seeton's &s;on was an ho&s;tage; his name is not in any record of that treaty: but pre&s;uming there was a former treaty, which was renewed or prolonged, and of which no record is now in being, this difficulty cea&s;es. Fordun expre&s;ly &s;ays, King Edward cau&s;ed Seeton's &s;on Thomas to be executed on a gibbet, in &s;ight of his parents; but agrees with Tyrell, that it was not done till after the time of the treaty was expired.</P></NOTE> This argument is futile, and &s;eems weak in oppo&s;ition to the uniformity of the Scotch Hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>On the 18th of July, <HI>Lord Douglas</HI> led his army over the Tweed, and encamped at a place called <HI>Bothull</HI> or <HI>Bothville:</HI> the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Halydown Hill,</HI> a very con&s;iderable eminence on the we&s;t of Berwick, having an ea&s;y declivity towards the river; the other &s;ides were &s;teeper. The Scotch di&s;regarding this apparent advantage, determined to engage on the Scotch &s;ide of the hill, not only to &s;ecure a retreat, but in ca&s;e of victory, to take advantage of the flow of tide, which would render the Tweed impa&s;&s;able to the Engli&s;h if they &s;hould be routed.</P>
<P>The Scotch army was di&s;po&s;ed in four grand divi&s;ions; <HI>John Murray</HI> commanded the fir&s;t, with <HI>Lord Andrew Frazer</HI> and his &s;ons <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>James;</HI> the &s;econd was commanded by <HI>Robert Lord High Steward of
<PB N="70" REF="73">
Scotland,</HI> with the principal men of his kindred and the <HI>Earl of Monteith;</HI> the third by the <HI>Earls of Ro&s;s, Sutherland, and Strathern;</HI> and the fourth by <HI>Lord Archibald Douglas,</HI> Guardian of the kingdom of Scotland, and Commander in Chief, accompanied by the Earls of <HI>Lenox</HI> and <HI>Carrick.</HI> The whole army amounted to 68,000. The number of King Edward's army is not po&s;itively mentioned by any author. It is &s;uppo&s;ed the number of the Scotch was not &s;o great as Hi&s;torians have a&s;&s;erted, and that they were nearly equal to their adver&s;aries. King Edward al&s;o di&s;po&s;ed his army in four divi&s;ions, each of which was flanked by choice and &s;kilful archers.</P>
<P>When both &s;ides were ready to engage, the on&s;et was a while &s;u&s;|pended, by the appearance of a Scotchman of gigantic &s;tature, who had gained the name of <HI>Turnbull,</HI> on account of a gallant exploit, by which King Robert Bruce was &s;aved from the attacks of a wild bull, which had unhor&s;ed him, as he was hunting. <HI>Turnbull,</HI> attended by a great ma&s;tiff,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of the Borderers on the we&s;tern Marches kept ma&s;tiffs or bull-dogs, which were let loo&s;e on the ravaging parties &mdash;Nichol&s;on and Burn's Hi&s;t.

After a &s;hort pau&s;e, which the &s;ingularity of the cir|cum&s;tance occa&s;ioned, the challenge was accepted by <HI>Sir Robert Benhale,</HI> a young Norfolk Knight, much inferior in &s;tature to the Scotch cham|pion, but of great &s;trength and adroitne&s;s in military atchievements. The ma&s;tiff immediately flew forward, and was received by the Knight with a &s;troke upon the loins with his &s;word, which &s;evered his body. The Scotch champion advanced: <HI>Benhale,</HI> with great agility and &s;kill, eluded the heavy blows aimed at him, and fir&s;t cut off the left arm of his adver&s;ary, and at la&s;t &s;truck off his head.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stowe.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Scotch army began to a&s;cend the hill about the hour of ve&s;pers, with great impetuo&s;ity; their leaders, chieftains, and men at arms di&s;|mounted, the more to animate the troops by rendering the danger equal. They were &s;oon out of breath, in con&s;equence of a&s;cending the &s;teep. The Engli&s;h archers were advantageou&s;ly placed, in different &s;tations on the hill, &s;o as to pour down &s;uch &s;howers of arrows on the clo&s;e bodies of the Scotch troops, as made a terrible &s;laughter: they were al&s;o greatly annoyed by the rolling down of large &s;tones from the emi|nence, and were &s;oon thrown into confu&s;ion.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Smollet, v. 2. p. 19.</NOTE> The Engli&s;h comman|ders

The Scotch often retreated, and again rallied and bravely returned to the fight, fiercely maintaining the battle till their General was pierced by a &s;pear: his fall &s;truck the army with a panic, and a total rout en&s;ued. The carnage was dreadful. The &s;ervants charged with the care of the hor&s;es fled, and left their ma&s;ters to the de&s;troying &s;word of a victorious enemy, who were not accu&s;tomed to mercy. Edward, at the head of a cho&s;en brigade of cavalry, and archers on hor&s;eback, at|tended by <HI>Lord D' Arcy</HI> with his Iri&s;h troops, led on the pur&s;uit, and directed the &s;laughter.

London only three days before he &s;et forward for Berwick; before which place he came on the 14th day of January with a large army, attended by a great naval power, with which he laid &s;iege to the town both by &s;ea and land.

a&s;&s;ault on other quarters: <HI>Sir Walter Manny,</HI> with miners brought from the fore&s;t of Dean, was employed at the &s;ame time, in advancing a mine below the wall. The&s;e vigorous mea&s;ures induced the garri&s;on to &s;urrender the town. Some of the Scotch Hi&s;torians &s;ay, the garri&s;on on the approach of King Edward's army evacuated the place, having

fir&s;t plundered it and beat down the walls. The King added greatly to the fortifications, and &s;trengthened the fortre&s;s with &s;everal new works. The &s;urprize of Berwick by the Scotch, is &s;poken of with &s;ome incredible circum&s;tances: <HI>Steward Earl of Angus,</HI> with <HI>Earl March,</HI> having collected a powerful navy, from different parts of Scotland, in which they embarked a cho&s;en band of &s;oldiers, entered Tweed in a dark night, and landed the forces under the walls unperceived: by break of day, with &s;caling ladders, they mounted the wall at Cowgate, and overpowered the guard; after which they &s;oon made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the whole town.

<P><PB N="78" REF="81"><HI>Berwick Ca&s;tle</HI> afterwards had many changes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. In the year 1377, &s;even intrepid and valiant Scots made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it in the night, killed the Governor, <HI>Sir Robert Boynton,</HI> and gave li|berty to his Lady under a ran&s;om of 2000 marks. But the&s;e heroes did not long po&s;&s;e&s;s their honourable acqui&s;ition, for the <HI>Earls of Nor|thumberland</HI> and <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and the <HI>Lords Lucy, Neville,</HI> and <HI>Stafford,</HI> with &s;everal other Engli&s;h Nobles, &s;oon after inve&s;ted the place, took the fortre&s;s by &s;torm, and put the Scots to the &s;word, who were in|crea&s;ed to the number of 48: but this was not effected till the &s;mall garri&s;on had held out eight days again&s;t 7000 Engli&s;h archers and 3000 hor&s;e, and during the a&s;&s;ault lo&s;t only two of their number. The Nor|thumbrians &s;oon after ravaged the territories of Lord March, in revenge for his de&s;troying the town of Roxburgh. The above-mentioned &s;ur|prize was effected in the night before the fea&s;t of St. Andrew. The leader, &s;ome authors &s;ay, was the valiant <HI>Sir John Gordon,</HI> but the Engli&s;h Hi&s;torians alledge it was <HI>Alexander Ram&s;ey.</HI> When the <HI>Earl of Northumberland</HI> &s;ummoned them to &s;urrender, they an&s;wered with in|&s;olence, <Q>that they would not yield it either to the King of England or Scotland, but would retain and defend it for the King of France.</Q></P>
<P>In 1384, the Scotch gained Berwick, by corrupting the Deputy Go|vernor. The <HI>Duke of Lanca&s;ter,</HI> then in enmity with <HI>Henry Percy</HI> Earl of Northumberland, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the King's ear, improved this circum|&s;tance greatly to the Earl's di&s;advantage, and he was in con&s;equence attainted of high trea&s;on, as having been guilty of treachery; and con|&s;equently his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were forfeited. The Earl thinking his imme|diate pre&s;ence before Berwick was of the fir&s;t con&s;equence, with a nu|merous army be&s;ieged the town; but blood&s;hed was &s;pared by the &s;e|cret application of 2000 marks, which regained the place. This event operated &s;o powerfully as to gain the King's pardon, and re&s;titution to the Earl of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and honours.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A.

<P>A con&s;piracy and in&s;urrection were formed in the year 1405, again&s;t King Henry IV, in which the <HI>Earl of Northumberland,</HI> the <HI>Arch|bi&s;hop of York, Thomas Mowbray,</HI> &s;on of the then Duke of Norfolk He|reditary Earl Mar&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, <HI>Lord Bardolph,</HI> and others, were the leaders.

The Archbi&s;hop, and Earl Mar&s;hal were apprehended, before the Earl of Northumber|land could join them with his forces, and &s;uffered execution at York. <HI>The Earl of Northumberland</HI> held the ca&s;tle of <HI>Berwick.</HI> On the King's arrival at Pontefract, he ordered a confi&s;cation of all the Earl's e&s;tates, and commanded the Sheriff of York&s;hire, to &s;ummon the whole military power of his county, to rendezvous at Newca&s;tle. The force with which the King proceeded on this expedition, was no le&s;s than 37,000 men, with engines and artillery for a &s;iege. This powerful ar|mament alarming the Earl, with his grand&s;on, the &s;on of <HI>Henry Hot|&s;pur,</HI> and <HI>Bardolph,</HI> he retired privily from Berwick, and took refuge in Scotland. <HI>Sir William Grey&s;tock</HI> was left to command the fortre&s;s.

of the fortifications were then new, the &s;ame having been con&s;tructed by King James III. of Scotland, after the &s;urrender above mentioned, who had expended a large &s;um in &s;trengthening and rebuilding the walls of the town, repairing the ca&s;tle, and furni&s;hing it with a compleat arrangement of artillery. The a&s;&s;ailants flattered them&s;elves, from the newne&s;s of the works, they &s;hould be able to beat them down without much difficulty, and ea&s;ily win the place; but although con&s;iderable breaches were effected, the garri&s;on made &s;o brave a defence, that after &s;pending a great part of the winter in carrying on the &s;iege, the Engli&s;h were obliged to rai&s;e it, and retire with di&s;grace.</P>
<P>King Edward IV. in the year 1482, about the beginning of July mar&s;halled his army at <HI>Alnwick,</HI> amounting to 22,000 men, the van of which was led by <HI>Henry Earl of Northumberland.</HI> So great a force appearing unexpectedly on the banks of Tweed oppo&s;ite to <HI>Berwick,</HI> the town made no re&s;i&s;tance, and was immediately &s;eized by the Eng|li&s;h. <HI>Lord Hales,</HI> who commanded the <HI>ca&s;tle,</HI> having an&s;wered that he was determined not to &s;urrender it, 4000 men under the command of <HI>Lord Stanley, Sir John Elrington, and Sir William Parr,</HI> were left to be|&s;iege it, whil&s;t the main army marched into Scotland.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 432.</NOTE> The great con|fu&s;ion which &s;hortly after took place in the Scotti&s;h &s;tate, it is &s;aid, was <HI>Lord Hales</HI>'s &s;ole motive for &s;urrendering the <HI>ca&s;tle</HI> on the 24th day of the &s;ucceeding Augu&s;t, he having no hope of &s;uccours. On the &s;uc|ceeding truce <HI>Berwick</HI> was given up to England, and the Scots engaged never again to attempt by any art the reduction of it.

<P>In the reigns of King Richard III. and King James III. of Scotland, Commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed by the two Crowns, to &s;et the limits of <HI>Berwick;</HI> on which occa&s;ion the di&s;puted ground was agreed to re|main uncultivated, unbuilt, and uninhabited.</P>

<P>On the 10th day of October A. D. 1525, a treaty was concluded at <HI>Berwick,</HI> between the Commi&s;&s;ioners of King Henry VIII. and King James V. for a three-years peace; and in the year 1528, the truce was renewed, and the peace continued for five years.</P>
<P>In the year 1547, King Henry VIII. being dead, leaving his &s;on Edward VI. an infant of ten years of age, the <HI>Earl of Hertford,</HI> then created <HI>Duke of Somer&s;et,</HI> in the month of Augu&s;t, advanced to <HI>Ber|wick</HI> with an army of 18,000 men, attended by a fleet of 34 &s;hips of war, 30 tran&s;ports and a galley, on an expedition to Scotland.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of the deva&s;tations made on this expedition, p. 37.</NOTE> The army lay encamped without the walls of the town.</P>
<P>In the year 1550, great repairs were made in the fortre&s;s of <HI>Berwick,</HI> the expence of which, with the repairs of Calais, are alledged in the King's Journals as the rea&s;on for deba&s;ing the coin; from thence it al&s;o appears, &s;ome of the walls had fallen, the foundations having been &s;haken by working a bulwark. Al&s;o in the year 1552, it appears con|&s;iderable improvements had been made to the fortifications, in which, by the minutes of Secretary Cecil,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hayne, p. 127.</NOTE> 6000l. had been expended. The fort then erected was contrived to have four bulwarks, for erecting which the wall was to have been left open, on the enemy's &s;ide, for a con&s;iderable &s;pace; but as this was dangerous and expen&s;ive, it was re&s;olved the wall &s;hould be &s;trengthened by an additional wall, and two &s;laughter-hou&s;es, to &s;cour the outer cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ains, and a great ditch intervening, that an other wall fortified in the &s;ame manner &s;hould be erected within the former. <HI>Sir Nicholas Sturley</HI> appears to have been nominated Captain of this new fort, <HI>Alexander Brett,</HI> Porter, and one <HI>Rokesby,</HI> Mar&s;hal. No ve&s;tiges of the&s;e works now appearing, it is to be pre&s;umed they were ra&s;ed, when Queen Elizabeth put the fortifica|tions upon a regular and modern plan.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="91">In the reigns of King Edward VI. and Queen Mary of Scotland, <HI>Berwick</HI> by treaty was made <HI>a county town,</HI> and as Rymer's Faedra notes it, "a free town independant of both &s;tates."</P>
<P>In the year 1558, <HI>Lord Wharton</HI> in his reports to the Lord Pre&s;ident of the North, &s;ays, the ordinary officers of the town appointed by let|ters patent, were, a Captain, a Mar&s;hal, a Trea&s;urer, a Chamberlain, a Porter, and a Ma&s;ter of the Ordnance: The&s;e with the Mayor for the year, were coun&s;ellors for the town, each having a yearly &s;alary, and pay for attendants.</P>
<P>In the year 1566, Queen Mary of Scotland came into the neighbour|hood to view <HI>Berwick;</HI> &s;he was met at the extreme of the liberties by the Deputy Governor and his train, who conducted her fir&s;t to <HI>Hallidon Hill,</HI> and thence to the we&s;t of the town, where &s;he had a perfect view of the place, and was &s;aluted by a general di&s;charge of the ordnance.</P>
<P>In 1588, King James VI. of Scotland did the like, and received the &s;ame &s;alute.</P>
<P>Queen Elizabeth having fortified <HI>Berwick,</HI> made the following mili|tary e&s;tabli&s;hment there, in the year 1576, as appears by the archieves of the borough.</P>

<PB N="90" REF="93">
Aldermen, and Commons, dated on the above day, informing the King, <Q>they had, with pre&s;ent expedition, and with what &s;olemnity the lei&s;ure of time would afford, publi&s;hed and proclaimed his &s;acred Maje&s;ty King of England, France, and Ireland; and entreats him to pardon &s;uch defects as by ignorance, omi&s;&s;ion, or otherwi&s;e, by the &s;traitne&s;s of time, had happened in the performance thereof.</Q> To which the King returned the following an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q>To our tru&s;ty friends, the Mayor and Aldermen of the town of Berwick.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Tru&s;ty friends, wee greet you heartily well. We render you thanks for your &s;o dutyfull affection, utterit in a&s;&s;i&s;ting and concur|ring &s;ae willingly with your Governour, in putting the town of Ber|wick in our hands, which we have appointit to be governed in the &s;ame form and manner as heretofore, while we advi&s;e otherwi&s;e to di&s;po&s;e upon the &s;ame; a&s;&s;uring you always to find us a gratious and loving Prince, wha &s;al be careful to maintaine your wonted liberties and privileges, and to &s;ee that the &s;ame be nae ways braugillit, nor otherwaies prejudget. Sua we commit you to God. From Hal|lirude hou&s;e this 27th day of March 1603.</Q></P>
<P>On the King's arrival at the boundary of the liberties of <HI>Berwick,</HI> he was received with every demon&s;tration of duty and welcome, by <HI>Sir John Carey,</HI> then Mar&s;hal, accompanied by the officers of the garri&s;on: their &s;everal corps of hor&s;e and foot were mar&s;halled in due order, and on the King's pa&s;&s;ing &s;aluted him with a <HI>feu de joy,</HI> which was return|ed by a di&s;charge of the artillery on the ramparts. The roads were lined with people, who on all &s;ides joined in the loude&s;t acclamations.</P>
<P>When his Maje&s;ty entered the gate, the keys of the town were deli|vered to him, by <HI>William Selby,</HI> Gentleman Porter; who was immedi|ately knighted, and the keys were returned. In the market-place, he was met by the body corporate of the borough; <HI>Hugh Greg&s;on,</HI> the Mayor, pre&s;ented him with an offering of gold, and &s;urrender of their charter; after which the Recorder made a &s;peech of congratulation: the&s;e the King received mo&s;t graciou&s;ly, at the &s;ame time re&s;toring the charter, and promi&s;ing his royal favour and protection. The King proceeded to the church to return thanks for his peaceful entry into his new dominions, when <HI>Toby Mathews, Bi&s;hop of Durham,</HI> preached an

excellent &s;ermon. From thence his Maje&s;ty went to the <HI>ca&s;tle,</HI> the ordnance were again di&s;charged, and the &s;treets re-echoed with accla|mations of joy. On the following day the King received &s;everal of the Engli&s;h Nobles, among whom were <HI>Lord Cobham,</HI> and <HI>Henry Howard,</HI> brother of the Duke of Norfolk, who came to Berwick to pay their duty to their new Sovereign: his Maje&s;ty in&s;pected the fortifications, magazines, and port, and at the head of the garri&s;on drawn out and under arms, with his own hands, di&s;charged a piece of ordnance.</P>
<P><HI>Berwick</HI> became the ducal title of <HI>James Fitz James,</HI> natural &s;on of King James II. of England, whom he created Duke of Berwick, A. D. 1686.</P>
<P><HI>Berwick</HI> is a borough of very great antiquity, being as before a&s;&s;ert|ed one of the four original Scotch burghs;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The town arms, a dog pa&s;&s;ant by a tree, in fe&s;&s;e point, two e&s;cutcheons with the arms of England and France quarterly, tied together by an arch; in chief a King &s;itting on an arch,' with a &s;cepter in the right hand, and a mound in his left.&mdash;Browne Willis.</NOTE> the corporation was pre|&s;criptive, but after this place became the &s;ettled po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h Crown, the corporate body was e&s;tabli&s;hed by charter; and at pre&s;ent con&s;i&s;ts of a Mayor, Recorder, and four Bailiffs, cho&s;en annually by the burge&s;&s;es. This borough was &s;ummoned to &s;end two members to parliament in the reign of King Henry VIII. the election of repre&s;enta|tives is by the burge&s;&s;es, the Mayor and Bailiffs making the return.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Repre&s;entatives in Parliament for the Town of Berwick.</P>

<P>The public Grammar School of Berwick upon Tweed, being vacant by the re&s;ignation of the late ma&s;ter, the Guild has determined to fill the employment, by the mo&s;t de&s;erving man they can find to undertake the charge.</P>
<P>Notice is hereby given, that the &s;aid employment will be di&s;po&s;ed of on Thur&s;day the 27th of December next, at Berwick, where the candidates are de&s;ired at that day, to make their per&s;onal appearance.</P>
<P>The corporation being duly &s;en&s;ible of the high importance of the charge, and how much the principles of the &s;ociety may be corrupted, their morals debauched, and the public peace di&s;turbed, by the jacobiti&s;m, bigotry, loo&s;e morals, imprudence, or ill temper of the per&s;on that is intru&s;ted with their children, at an age &s;u&s;ceptible of every impre&s;&s;ion, de&s;ire that who|ever is willing to offer them&s;elves as candidates for &s;uch employment, may, on or before the 27th of November, &s;end certificates &s;ealed up and enclo&s;ed, to the Town Clerk of Berwick, under the hands of gentlemen of probity and knowledge, of their zeal for liberty and the pre|&s;ent con&s;titution, their &s;obriety, moderation, good conduct and temper, as the corporation is re&s;olved to commit that care to the per&s;on who &s;hall appear be&s;t qualified: and therefore after the attention to their characters in the&s;e re&s;pects, gentlemen of undoubted honour will be em|ployed to examine into the learning of the per&s;ons be&s;t recommended.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter has a commodious dwelling-hou&s;e and garden; the &s;alary for teaching freemen's children is 60l. per annum, and 10s. a quarter for teaching every unfreeman's child; out of which the ma&s;ter is to provide him&s;elf with an u&s;her, at a yearly &s;alary not le&s;s than 20l. who is to be approved by the Guild.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The chief <HI>imports</HI> of the <HI>port of Berwick</HI> are from Norway and the Baltic, con&s;i&s;ting of timber and deals: the <HI>exports,</HI> corn, wool, &s;almon, and eggs; the latter of which articles, though apparently &s;mall or in|&s;ignificant in the li&s;t, yet brings in an annual &s;um of 13 or 14,000l. they being &s;ent to London for the u&s;e of &s;ugar refiners, &amp;c. packed in boxes the thick end down.</P>
<P>The &s;almon fi&s;hery here is very con&s;iderable. Mr Pennant &s;peaks of it in the following terms: <Q>They lay on each &s;ide the river, and are all private property, except what belongs to the Dean and Chapter of Durham, which in rent and tithe of fi&s;h, brings in 450l. per annum: for all the other fi&s;heries are liable to tithe. The common rents of the&s;e are 50l. a year, for which tenants have as much &s;hore, as &s;erves to launch out and draw their nets on &s;hore; the limits of each are &s;taked, and I ob&s;erved that the fi&s;hers never failed going as near as po&s;&s;ible to their neighbour's limits. One man goes off in a &s;mall flat-bottomed
<PB N="98" REF="101">
boat, &s;quare at one end; and taking as large a circuit as his net admits, brings it on &s;hore at the extremity of his boundary, where others a&s;&s;i&s;t in landing it. The be&s;t fi&s;hery is on the &s;outh &s;ide; very fine &s;almon trout are often taken here, which come up from the &s;ea to &s;pawn, and return in the &s;ame manner as the &s;almon do. For a fuller account of this fi&s;hery, vide Briti&s;h Zoology III. 241. To it may al&s;o be added, that in the middle of the river, not a mile we&s;t of the town, is a large &s;tone, on which a man is placed, to ob&s;erve what is called the <HI>Reck</HI> of the &s;almon coming up.</Q></P>
<P>Hi&s;torians have differed greatly in the etymology of the name of <HI>Berwick.</HI> Camden &s;eems to determine in favour of the Saxon <GAP DESC="foreign">, the town of <HI>the Bernicians.</HI></P>
<P>After having mentioned the evidences of antiquity, it is requi&s;ite, before I quit the &s;ubject, I &s;hould &s;peak of <HI>Berwick</HI> in its natural &s;tate. Being built on an angular point of land, at the mouth of Tweed, on two &s;ides it is bounded by water: the &s;ea in this part of the channel is tempe&s;tuous and rough, the tide &s;etting in very &s;trong, occa&s;ions a heavy &s;urge, which increa&s;ed by frequent &s;torms, renders the coa&s;t tre|mendous. The pro&s;pect of the ocean conveys to the contemplative mind, a grand a&s;&s;ociation of images, which de&s;cribe the might and maje&s;ty of the Creator. As I walked the banks, imagination roved at large, but took a melancholy &s;train; I conceived I heard the alarm guns fired at Bambrough Ca&s;tle, and the &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s waved in my Fancy's eye, from &s;ome ve&s;&s;el at a di&s;tance. The ocean, which before had affected my &s;oul with a &s;cene of magnificent delight, now &s;eemed full of horror and di&s;may; the rolling billows became tremendous, the yawning gulph an object of gloomy terror, the whole conveyed the apprehen&s;ion of imminent peril and di&s;tre&s;s; and in the end, all the agonies of a di&s;tracted crew, who laboured for life, filled my imagina|tion, and the wanderings of Fancy were replete with di&s;may and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of <HI>Berwick</HI> have enough of &s;uch horrid &s;cenes: the coa&s;t is terrible to mariners. After having once been witne&s;s to &s;o me|lancholy an event, one would &s;carce ever look upon the &s;ea again with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>The Land Pro&s;pect</HI> doth not produce a &s;cene wild enough to be called romantic, or &s;ufficiently cultivated, to be &s;mooth, placid, and agreeable.
<PB N="99" REF="102">
The banks of Tweed lo&s;s much of their &s;weetne&s;s in the environs of the town; and Flora re&s;erves mo&s;t of her beauties for the neighbourhood of <HI>Kel&s;o</HI> and <HI>Cold&s;tream.</HI> Below Berwick bridge, there is not enough either of trade or tranquillity; it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the middle &s;tation; neither bu&s;y enough nor enough at re&s;t, is dulne&s;s. Above bridge, in the fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on, the &s;cene is beautifully enlivened. Below, &s;ome few ve&s;&s;els are moored, but too often the heavy hulks are turned up on the dry &s;ands, with ma&s;ts unrigged, waiting for trade and tide. Such are dull objects to the eye, and have no other effect upon the &s;pectator than to promote wearine&s;s and impatiency.</P>
<P>Over the arm of the &s;ea which breaks upon the bar of Tweed, the lands to the &s;outhward are extended for &s;everal miles upon the view, varied with the happy colourings which &s;ucceed to cultivation; but the di&s;tance is &s;o great, that objects are indi&s;tinct, and the beauties of the land&s;kip lay in confu&s;ion: two often indeed the whole is enveloped in &s;ea vapour.</P>
<P>I cannot take my departure from the banks of Tweed, without pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome few thoughts on the carnage and blood&s;hed, which for ages ren|dered them famous to the arms of both the Scotch and Engli&s;h; and to po&s;terity made their hi&s;tory a &s;ubject of horror and dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>Alberic Bi&s;hop of O&s;tia, being &s;ent as Legate from Pope Innocent II. on his vi&s;itation at Carli&s;le, is &s;aid to have taken great pains to remon|&s;trate to the army of King David of Scotland, after the retreat from the battle of Alerton, that they ought to wage war with greater humanity; and prevailed with them &s;o far as to gain the relea&s;e of the female cap|tives, whom they were carrying as &s;laves into Scotland. He al&s;o ob|tained their &s;olemn engagement, that in future inroads they would not violate the churches and religious hou&s;es; and would al&s;o &s;pare from the &s;word, women, infants, and the aged. The&s;e &s;hew to us what were the infamous enormities committed in the&s;e expeditions.</P>
<P>The war carried on between the two nations, was as brutal as any in the annals of the Caribbees, or any &s;avages under the &s;un. The pub|lic injuries of &s;tates, the policy of empires, the balance of trade, the peace of Europe, or the equilibrium of power, were not the objects of warfare: like the wild Arabs, the e&s;tate of the people was that of rob|bers, rapine and plunder their objects; as if devoid of all religious &s;en&s;e
<PB N="100" REF="103">
of oaths and moral obligations, the compacts of &s;tates, and the ties of honour and moral hone&s;ty, they often for&s;ook every principle for plun|der, and like barbarians, levied war for the &s;ake of pillaging, of re|pri&s;al, and retribution. When the wolves de&s;cend the Alps upon the villages, it is the effect of hunger in its extreme; but here the blood of the pea&s;ant was &s;hed without any cogency of cau&s;e, but the lucre of his herds, flocks, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The immortal <HI>King John</HI> burnt, laid wa&s;te, and de&s;troyed half the i&s;land, from York northward: Alexander in all his glory never exhibited a more noble conflagration. Edward contaminated his honours with many of tho&s;e atchievements. Torrents of blood have i&s;&s;ued from the&s;e borders; they were the common char|nel of the two nations. Thirty-three thou&s;and &s;ouls fled in one day to the gates of eternity, di&s;patched by the command of Princes, who could not account to heaven what it was they fought for. The petit ma&s;&s;acres were equally as incon&s;iderate; the heroes of tho&s;e bands walked forth with their adherents, imbruing their hands in human gore, burning and de&s;troying, laying wa&s;te towers, towns and villages, and &s;preading de&s;o|lation, in the mo&s;t &s;avage manner, for the reward of &s;avages: reciprocal &s;laughters, deva&s;tations, and cruelties marked both people. When the mo&s;t valiant atchievements were performed, even in the pre&s;ence of their Princes, revenge appeared to be the only in&s;tigation, and common ju&s;tice was &s;eldom con&s;idered. What was the battle of Allerton, in the reign of Stephen, when David with a mighty &s;laughter was overthrown, after having ravaged Northumberland and Durham, returning like a di&s;|appointed mi&s;creant, with his hands red in the blood of thou&s;ands of his band of robbers! William King of Scotland was a pri&s;oner on one of his incur&s;ions: he witne&s;&s;ed a cruel &s;laughter of his people. Our Edward I. &s;lew 60,000 at Falkirk; Edward III. &s;lew his tens of thou&s;ands at Hally-down Hill; and Penrith and Durham witne&s;&s;ed to the &s;ucceeding de|&s;truction made of the Scots in this reign under their unfortunate David, who in the battle at the la&s;t-mentioned place was made pri&s;oner. The battles of Otterburn and Flodden Field were upon the &s;ame principles as the others.&mdash;How doth this retro&s;pection fully the hero, &s;tain the lu&s;tre of his arms, and the honour of his valour! yet it is too true &s;uch were the conflicts on the borders, and &s;uch the arms that waged the inglorious warfare on this once wretched, but now mo&s;t happy coun|try; at this time abounding with wealth, flowing from peace, by the channels of cultivation, manufactory, and trade: where the brethren of one climate and one i&s;land, under the ble&s;&s;ed protection of one com|mon father, and a con&s;titution admired and envied by all the world,
<PB N="101" REF="104">
are acting together in a &s;tate of mutual offices, to contribute to the general opulence and felicity.</P>
<P>How baneful and obnoxious is he to the common intere&s;ts of this now united family, who attempts to &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;atisfaction and jealou&s;y, and through calumnies ari&s;ing in the venom of malevo|lence and di&s;appointed ambition endeavours to cultivate contempt and aver&s;ion between the brethren of this land!

<P>The acce&s;&s;ion of King James the VI. to the Crown of England, ope|rated powerfully towards the felicity of this part of the i&s;land; cultiva|tion immediately took place, the country &s;o often de&s;olated by war, received new inhabitants, who brought with them not only flocks and herds, but al&s;o manufactories and commerce: the works effected in peace were &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed, the barren wa&s;tes were put under the plough &s;hare, towns and hamlets diver&s;ified the &s;cene, and increa&s;ing population enlivened every valley, which for ages had been marked by works of ho&s;tility. Yet it was not till the union of the two kingdoms, that the&s;e effects of peace were brought to the happy eminence now di&s;covered on every hand. As to political advantages, it is evident, their di&s;cu&s;&s;ion comes not within my plan in this work; I am per|&s;uaded of their va&s;t importance to both nations: Mrs Macauley &s;ays, <Q>on very &s;ound principles of policy, the union had been &s;everal times rejected by both nations; and which was with great difficulty coerced on the Scots: though as Burnet ob&s;erves, the advantages which were offered to Scotland, in the whole frame of it, were great and vi&s;ible. The Scots were to bear le&s;s than the fortieth part of the public taxes, and they were to have the eleventh part of the legi&s;la|ture. Trade was to be free all over the i&s;land, and to the plantations; private rights were to be pre&s;erved; and the judicature and laws of Scotland were &s;till to be continued.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Lord Marchmont</HI> having been pointed at by Hi&s;torians as being one of tho&s;e corrupt par|tizans, who effected the <HI>union</HI> from &s;ini&s;ter views, the following <HI>authentic letter</HI> in the <HI>author</HI>'s cu&s;tody, among many &s;tate papers found in the cabinet of the late <HI>Lord Wharton,</HI> will be thought worthy a place here: To which &s;ome hi&s;torical notes, &amp;c. are added.</P>

<P>I have been long wi&s;hing an opportunity to a&s;&s;i&s;t in that de&s;ign; being convinced that an union of the kingdoms is the only &s;olid way to &s;ecure the religion and liberty,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Duke of Hamilton's &s;peech was &s;pirited: <Q>What! &s;hall we in one day give up what our forefathers maintained with their lives and fortunes for many ages?

<P>Tho&s;e who promoted the union were headed by the Dukes of Queen&s;berry and Argyle, the Earls of Montro&s;e, Seafield, and Stair.</P>

<P>All the delays which we have &s;uffered have not dimini&s;hed our zeal, though they have prolonged our mi&s;e|ries and misfortunes.</P>

<P>I confe&s;s, that after having waited for him for a long while, our &s;ervour began to dimini&s;h, in proportion to our hopes; but his prudence and good conduct joined to his indefatigable diligence, has revived our ardor; and he has put our affairs into &s;o good order, that we hope they will come to an happy i&s;&s;ue.

<PB N="102" REF="105"></NOTE> yet I am of opinion, that the fancies they have taken up will &s;oon vani&s;h, and will not be the hinderance of con|cluding a treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="104">Upon the 4th current the hou&s;e came to a que&s;tion, <Q>Approve the fir&s;t article of the treaty or not?</Q>&mdash;With this provi&s;ion, that if other articles be not adju&s;ted by the parliament, the agreeing to the fir&s;t &s;hould be of no effect.</P>
<P>The voters pre&s;ent were 199, of which 116 were approvers, 83 were oppo&s;ers; of the&s;e 66 entered their di&s;&s;ent and prote&s;ted&mdash;17 would not join in the di&s;&s;ent, becau&s;e they differed from the approvers, only in that they were not for putting a que&s;tion upon the fir&s;t article, till votes &s;hould pa&s;s on the 4th, 5th, and &s;ome other following articles: and I think, the mo&s;t part of, if not all the 17, are for an entire union, if the terms plea&s;e them.</P>
<P>Several very under&s;tanding and well affected members find difficulties in &s;ome of the articles, whereof they apprehend &s;ome to be in&s;uperable, unle&s;s they meet with a remedy from the wi&s;dom of England.</P>
<P>Many of the more judicious members are little moved by the cro&s;s humour rai&s;ed among the people, by the pains of ill-de&s;igning men, while it is founded only upon &s;peculation, for they think that will vani&s;h. But if the mulitude of the lower people, &s;hall at the beginning feel a &s;en&s;ible prejudice by the execution of any article, then the danger may prove greater among a hot &s;tubborn vulgar, than can well be fore&s;een.</P>
<P>I cannot yet conde&s;cend upon particulars, which I will do when I am able to explain them more di&s;tinctly: this I can &s;ay in the general, that I am only apprehen&s;ive of &s;uch things as may univer&s;ally affect the common people, before they can have much reli&s;h of the advantages which certainly will in cour&s;e be the product and fruit of an union.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e who in the la&s;t were called the new party, made up of the Peers and Gentlemen who were laid a&s;ide from public employment and the council in the year 1705, and others their friends upon whom they have influence, who have &s;till &s;tuck toge|ther, above 24 in number, were &s;u&s;pected that they would go cro&s;s to the Mini&s;ters: but God
<PB N="104" REF="107">be thanked they have not done &s;o, for which they merit e&s;teem and thanks from all who wi&s;h well to her Maje&s;ty and her kingdoms. They have carried them&s;elves and concurred as per&s;ons of honour and under&s;tanding, for promoting the common good, without any appearance of re&s;entment towards tho&s;e now employed. Whereas if they had joined with the oppo&s;ers of the union, the promoters of it here were not able to carry it through.</P>

<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The difficulties and warm debates which happened in the hou&s;e, led me to delay the &s;ending my letter, till I could give you this further account.</P>
<P>The 2d, 3d, and 4th articles of the treaty are approved, with the like provi&s;ion as the fir&s;t is; but the carrying of the&s;e votes was with a great deal of wrangle and conte&s;t: even as much upon the 4th (wherein we expected little re&s;i&s;tance) as upon any of the former; whereby it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern the de&s;ign of the oppo&s;ers. Yet our greater difficulty is to keep many by whom we mu&s;t carry our votes, from being mi&s;led by the de&s;igning oppo&s;ers, with the &s;ubtle pretences they make; &s;o plau&s;ible, as are of danger to prevail upon the le&s;s under&s;tanding &s;ort of well-meaning per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The 5th article is this day approved, with this alteration. <Q>The Diet is changed from the time of &s;igning the treaty for the union, to the time of ratifying the treaty.</Q></P>
<P>"I know not how your parliament may like this, but I am hopeful that an affair of &s;o ma|nifold advantages to this i&s;land, as an entire union may prove, will not &s;top upon differences of le&s;&s;er moment.</P>
<P>What I fore&s;ee of this &s;ort, brings to my remembrance a very old treaty betwixt Reheboam and the tribes of I&s;rael; and of the wi&s;e advice which the old Coun&s;ellors gave him. This &s;imilitude halts, as commonly all do; yet I believe your Lord&s;hip will find &s;omething in it that may be of u&s;e.</P>

The rock on which the ca&s;tle &s;tands, is acce&s;&s;ible only by a winding pa&s;s cut on its &s;outhern &s;ide: the narrow limits of its crown will not admit of many works, the whole &s;trength con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;ingle battery on the &s;outh-ea&s;t point, mounted with &s;even or eight guns, which commands the approach to the i&s;land from the &s;ea; but would be of little con&s;equence again&s;t a &s;hip of any con|&s;iderable force.

The pre&s;ent fortifications appear to be the work of the la&s;t century. In the military e&s;tabli&s;hment made by Queen Eliza|beth for <HI>Berwick</HI> in 1576, the ca&s;tle is noted, and a patent for life was granted to <HI>Sir William Read</HI> as keeper of the fortre&s;&s;es of <HI>Holy I&s;land</HI> and <HI>Farn,</HI> with a yearly payment of 362l. 17s. 6d. per annum.</P>

The fir&s;t time it occurs, is in the hi&s;tory of the civil war in the time of Charles I. when it appears to have been &s;eized for the Parliament; and according to Ru&s;hworth, in an order of the Hou&s;e of Commons, May 7th, 1646, for &s;ending forces thither, this rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned, "it being of &s;uch con&s;equence to the northern parts of the kingdom.

<P><Q>In the year 1647, one Captain Batton was Governor of the i&s;land, for the Parliament; to whom Sir Marmaduke Langdale, after the taking of Berwick, wrote the following letter, but without &s;ucce&s;s.

<P><Q>Holy I&s;land does not appear ever to have fallen into the hands of the Royali&s;ts; for it continued in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Parliamenta|rians anno. 1648; when it was (as may be &s;een in Ru&s;hworth) re|lieved with nece&s;&s;aries by Colonel Fenwick's hor&s;e and &s;ome dragoons. From that time nothing memorable &s;eems to have been tran&s;acted here, till the rebellion in the year 1715, when the &s;eizure of this ca&s;tle was planned and performed by two men only. In which ex|ploit, &s;uch policy and courage were exerted, as would have done them much honour, had they been employed in a better cau&s;e. The following particulars of the &s;tory were communicated by a Gentleman who&s;e father was an eye-witne&s;s to the facts, and well knew both the parties.</Q></P>
<P><Q>One Lancelot Errington, a man of an ancient and re&s;pectable fa|mily in Northumberland, and of a bold and enterprizing &s;pirit, en|tered into a con&s;piracy for &s;eizing this ca&s;tle for the Pretender; in which it is &s;aid, he was promi&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance not only by Mr For&s;ter, the rebel General then in arms, but al&s;o by the ma&s;ters of &s;everal French privateers. At this time the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;erjeant, a corporal, and 10 or 12 men only. In order to put this &s;cheme in execution, being well known in that country, he went to the ca&s;tle, and after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with the &s;erjeant, invited him and the re&s;t of the men, who were not immediately on duty, to partake of a treat on board of the &s;hip of which he was ma&s;ter, then lying in the har|bour: this being un&s;u&s;pectingly accepted of, he &s;o well plied his gue&s;ts with brandy, that they were &s;oon incapable of any oppo&s;ition. The&s;e men being thus &s;ecured, he made &s;ome pretence for going on &s;hore; and with Mark Errington his nephew, returning again to the ca&s;tle, they knocked down the centinel, &s;urprized and turned out an old gunner, the corporal, and two other &s;oldiers, being the remain|der of the garri&s;on, and &s;hutting the gates, hoi&s;ted the Pretender's colours as a &s;ignal of their &s;ucce&s;s, anxiou&s;ly expecting the promi&s;ed &s;uccours. No reinforcement coming, but on the contrary a party of the King's troops arriving from Berwick, they were obliged to retreat
<PB N="109" REF="112">
over the walls of the ca&s;tle, among the rocks, hoping to conceal them|&s;elves under the &s;ea weeds till it was dark, and then by &s;wimming to the main land, to make their e&s;cape: but the tide ri&s;ing, they were obliged to &s;wim, when the &s;oldiers firing at Lancelot as he was climb|ing up a rock, wounded him in the thigh. Thus di&s;abled, he and his nephew were taken and conveyed to Berwick gaol, where they con|tinued till his wound was cured. During this time he had digged a burrow quite under the foundations of the pri&s;on, depo&s;iting the earth taken out in an old oven. Through this burrow he and his nephew, with divers other pri&s;oners, e&s;caped; but mo&s;t of the latter were &s;oon after taken. The two Erringtons however had the good fortune to make their way to the Tweed&s;ide, where they found the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e boat; they rowed them&s;elves over, and afterwards turned it adrift. From thence they pur&s;ued their journey to Bam|brough Ca&s;tle, near which they were concealed nine days in a pea|&s;tack; a relation who re&s;ided in the ca&s;tle &s;upplying them with pro|vi&s;ion. At length travelling in the night by &s;ecret paths, they reached Gate&s;head Hou&s;e, near Newca&s;tle, where they were &s;ecreted till they procured a pa&s;&s;age from Sunderland to France. A reward of 500l. was now offered to any one who would apprehend them; notwith|&s;tanding which, Lancelot was &s;o daring as &s;oon after to come into England, and even to vi&s;it &s;ome of his friends in Newgate. After the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the rebellion, when every thing was quiet, he and his nephew took the benefit of the general pardon, and returned to Newca&s;tle, where he died about the year 1746, as it is &s;aid, of grief at the victory of Culloden.</Q></P>
<P>The remains of the old <HI>abbey</HI> in the next place require my attention; &s;uch parts of this cathedral are &s;tanding as give a perfect idea of its original form and appearance. The <HI>mona&s;tery</HI> is in ragged ruins, and not worthy to be delineated, the walls having been robbed for the build|ings in the village, and the erection of the pre&s;ent parochial church.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid by &s;ome authors, that the <HI>mona&s;tery</HI> was built by <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> of a plain model, without ornament, and enclo&s;ed with a high wall, in order that outward objects might not withdraw the attention of the &s;o|ciety from their divine contemplations.</P>
<P>In Mr We&s;t's Antiquities of <HI>Furne&s;s Abbey,</HI> we have this &s;hort account of the ri&s;e and origin of Mona&s;tic Orders. <Q>Soon after the chri&s;tian
<PB N="110" REF="113">
religion had made &s;ome con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the ea&s;t, the policy of the Roman empire expo&s;ed the profe&s;&s;ors of it to many and great in|conveniencies, and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bloody per&s;ecutions: the two la&s;t under Decius and Diocle&s;ian more e&s;pecially obliged many to betake them&s;elves to mountains, de&s;erts, and &s;olitary places, to &s;ecure them|&s;elves from the unrelenting fury of the&s;e bloody tyrants: there they found a &s;afe retreat, with time and liberty to give them&s;elves up to the exerci&s;es of piety and divine contemplation, in a cour&s;e of mo&s;t rigorous mortifications, and preternatural au&s;terities. This kind of life, which nece&s;&s;ity gave ri&s;e to, was afterwards in the time of the Chri&s;tian Emperors, embraced through choice; and <HI>Pacomius</HI> about the middle of the 4th century, committed to writing rules for regu|lar &s;ocieties, and founded &s;ome mona&s;teries in the environs of Thebes in Egypt.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The introduction of Monks into England, is &s;poken of as a ma&s;ter-piece of policy in the court of Rome, as endeavouring thereby to &s;ecure her authority by an increa&s;e of property, which would ari&s;e to her by the pious donations and offerings of the faithful, and the founding of many religious hou&s;es, to be occupied by &s;uch as were, from the nature of their in&s;titute, attached to the Holy See, and might occa&s;ionally &s;erve every purpo&s;e of &s;piritual tyranny. And it is alledged, that the Monks by the au&s;terity of their religion and morals fa&s;cinated the minds of the people, and by their preten&s;ion to extra|ordinary &s;anctity, &s;ecured a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all their deci&s;ions, and an implicit obedience to all their doctrines. This is a heavy charge, and if well grounded, &s;hould have prevented the mona&s;tic rule from ever taking effect in any kingdom, or occa&s;ioned its ruin as &s;oon as the di&s;covery was made, or the charge formed.</Q></P>
<P>This he obviates, by mona&s;teries being e&s;tabli&s;hed here before Au&s;tin's time; and takes for his authorities Gildas and Bede, as to their being &s;chools of chri&s;tian learning. He adds, <Q>in all this, we hear nothing of foreign connections, of &s;ini&s;ter inventions, or hypocri&s;y.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Roman Pontiff knew how to draw from the circum&s;tances of William's afrairs, advantages which the Conqueror never intended; and which his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors could not prevent, as they were equally or more obliged to the church for her &s;upport, than he him&s;elf had been. The foreign Eccle&s;ia&s;tics which the Norman King

introduced, readily gave up the liberty of a country, to which they were &s;trangers, and a happine&s;s the &s;weets whereof they had never known: but from that con&s;equence, of which the Conqueror and his &s;ons had made them, they &s;oon became &s;en&s;ible of ther own impor|tance; the foreign Monks, from the great property conferred upon them, &s;oon found of what weight they were in the &s;cale of govern|ment, and readily turned it to their own advantages, as occa&s;ion of|fered.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The introduction, therefore, of &s;o many new orders of Monks into England by the Norman Kings, was according to their own policy, and not that of the Court of Rome.</Q>&mdash;He then takes occa&s;ion to men|tion the good offices of the church in favour of the Conqueror's younger &s;ons, and the Earl of Moreton and King John.</P>
<P><Q>The Court of Rome could have no direct hand in all this; and the mona&s;tick in&s;titute, of its own nature, can have no part in either a civil or a &s;piritual tyranny, unle&s;s where perverted; as the be&s;t of in&s;titutes may have been, by the malice of men.</Q>&mdash;I have been led to lengthen the quotation beyond the bounds I at fir&s;t intended, to &s;hew with what arguments this &s;ubtle author, and other writers of the like cla&s;s, can put a plau&s;ible countenance on facts, which reflected di&s;ho|nour on the See of Rome. But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The cathedral is in the form of a cro&s;s, the ea&s;t and we&s;t limbs of which are yet &s;tanding, the other parts totally in ruins, and almo&s;t level with the ground. The order of building in this &s;tructure is rude and heavy, and mo&s;t of it in the wor&s;t mode of the early Saxon architecture. Mr Gro&s;e &s;ays, <Q>probably it was the work of different periods; great part of it &s;eems very ancient, the arches being circular, and the co|lumns very ma&s;&s;y and much like tho&s;e at Durham, but richer. On the north and &s;outh walls there are pointed arches, which proves that part of it at lea&s;t was built &s;ince the reign of Henry II.</Q> The pil|lars on which the arches ri&s;e in the center of the cro&s;s are clu&s;tered and plain capitalled, each forming the corner of the great tower; the&s;e arches are of few members. There are two &s;ide ailes, the columns of which are heavy, and the arches circular: the windows are nar|row, and ornamented with a corner pila&s;ter, and a moulding of few members: the walls are very thick, and every part wears a gloomy countenance. The &s;outh wall of the middle tower is &s;tanding about 50

One of tho&s;e arches yet remains, unloaded with any &s;u|per&s;tructure, &s;upported by the &s;outh-ea&s;t and north-we&s;t corner pillars, and ornamented with the dancette or zig-zag moulding, much u&s;ed in old Saxon architecture, extending a fine bow over the cha&s;m and heap of ruins occa&s;ioned by the falling-in of the ailes. The whole &s;tructure is compo&s;ed of a &s;oft red free-&s;tone, which yields much to time, and renders the a&s;pect of the building dark and melancholy. Mr Gro&s;e's account comprehends the following particulars:</P>
<P><Q>Various fragments of the offices of this mona&s;tery are &s;till &s;tand|ing, and foundations of buildings are &s;cattered over a clo&s;e of near four acres; the main walls of the church on the north and &s;outh &s;ides are &s;till &s;tanding, though much out of the perpendicular; inclining outwards &s;o con&s;iderably, as to make the horizontal di&s;tance between them, at the top, exceed, by near two feet, that at the bottom. Ano|ther winter or two &s;eems to be the utmo&s;t they can &s;tand.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This building con&s;i&s;ts of a body and two &s;ide ailes, into which it is divided by a double row of very &s;olid columns, who&s;e &s;hafts are richly ornamented. Each row has five columns of four different con|&s;tructions, and two pila&s;ters in the walls on the ea&s;t and we&s;t ends. The &s;hafts of the&s;e columns are about 12 feet high, their diameters about five, their capitals and pede&s;tals are plain, they &s;upport circular arches, having over each arch two ranges of windows; the lowe&s;t large and in pairs, &s;eparated only by a &s;hort column; the upper &s;mall and &s;ingle. The length of the building is about 138 feet, the breadth of the body 18 feet, and that of the two &s;ide ailes about nine feet each.</Q></P>

<P>The effigies of this Saint were placed at the north door of the entrance into the quire of the cathedral at Durham, underneath which was the following in&s;cription: <Q>Sanctus Aidanus na|tione Scotus, Monachus Mona&s;terii de Hii, Epi&s;copus factus per O&s;waldum vocatus, anno gratiae 635, fundavit &s;edem Epi&s;copalem &amp; Monachorum congregationem in in&s;ula Lindisfar|nen&s;i, ac gentem Berniciorum, co-operante &s;ancto O&s;waldo ad fidem Chri&s;ti convertit.

<P><HI>O&s;wald,</HI> the &s;econd &s;on of <HI>Ethelfrid,</HI> &s;ucceeded to both the kingdoms (<HI>Deira</HI> and <HI>Bernicia</HI>) a noble and virtuous Prince, who&s;e chief &s;tudy was to promote the chri&s;tian religion. To this effect he &s;ent his Emba&s;&s;adors unto Donald IV. then reigning in Scotland, and entreated him by the old familiarity that had been among them, to help him with &s;ome worthy and learned men that could in&s;truct his people in the faith of Chri&s;t. The King recommending the matter to the Clergy, one <HI>Cormanus</HI> was elected to go thither; but his labours proving unprofitable, he returned about the end of the year, and in a &s;ynod of the Bi&s;hops and Clergy, informed them, that they were a people &s;o <HI>indocile and froward,</HI> that the pains taken upon them were lo&s;t, they neither being de&s;irous nor capable of in&s;truction.</P>
<P>It grieved the &s;ynod exceedingly to hear this, and while they were con&s;ulting what to do, <HI>Aidanus,</HI> a learned man and reverend preacher, is &s;aid to have advi&s;ed them not to give over the work at any hands, for that the bad &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Cormanus</HI>'s labours might po&s;&s;ibly proceed from him&s;elf, that had not u&s;ed the people tenderly, nor according to the Apo&s;tle's rules <Q>fed them at fir&s;t with milk;</Q> and therefore de&s;ired &s;ome other approved man might be employed of new, who would probably do good among them.</P>
<P>This opinion allowed by all, none was thought fitter for this &s;ervice than he who had given the advice; and &s;o with common con&s;ent was <HI>Aidan</HI> ordained Bi&s;hop, and appointed to that charge. Being come thither, he &s;et him&s;elf to amend the fault which he &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Corman</HI> had committed, and &s;o tempered his doctrine, as multitudes of people daily did re&s;ort unto him to be in&s;tructed. It was great hinderance unto him at fir&s;t, that he was not &s;killed in the <HI>Saxon</HI> tongue, neither did the people under&s;tand his language; but this defect the King him&s;elf &s;up|plied, interpreting to the auditory all that <HI>Aidanus</HI> delivered in his &s;ermon: &s;o by the King's zeal, and <HI>Aidanus</HI>'s diligence, &s;uch numbers were brought to the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, as in the &s;pace of &s;even days 15,000 per&s;ons were by him baptized.</P>
<P>Whether this people were more happy in their King or in this Bi&s;hop, it is difficult to &s;ay, for the King he did &s;o excel in piety and prudence, that, as <HI>Beda</HI> writes, all the nations and provinces within Britain were at his devotion; and not the le&s;s his heart was never lifted up within him, but &s;till he &s;hewed him&s;elf courteous and affable, and of the poor mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate. Among examples of his liberality towards the&s;e, the &s;ame <HI>Beda</HI> related, that &s;itting at table on Ea&s;ter-day, and <HI>Aidanus</HI> by him, when it was told that a number of poor men were at the gate expecting his alms, he commanded to carry the meat that was &s;et before him unto them, and the platter of &s;ilver wherein it was to be broke in pieces, and di&s;tributed among them. <HI>Ai|danus</HI> beholding it, took the King by the right hand, and ki&s;&s;ing it, &s;aid, <HI>"Nunquam marce&s;ca haec manus,"</HI> never let this hand con&s;ume or wither; which, as he writeth, came al&s;o to pa&s;s, for being killed in battle, and his arm and his hand cut off, the &s;ame was enclo&s;ed in a &s;ilver &s;hrine, and remained for many years uncorrupted, in the church of St. Peter, at <HI>Bambrough.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Aidanus,</HI> he was an en&s;ample of ab&s;tinence, &s;obriety, cha&s;tity, charity, and all other epi&s;copal virtues; for as he taught, &s;o he lived, was idle at no time, nor did he admit any of his retinue to be &s;o, but kept them in a continual exerci&s;e, either reading &s;cripture or learning the p&s;alms of David by heart. If he was invited to any fea&s;t (as rarely he went) he made no &s;tay, but after a little refre&s;hment taken, got him&s;elf away. In preaching he was mo&s;t diligent, travelling through the country, for the greater part on foot, and in&s;tructing the people where|&s;oever he came. In a word, he was deficient in no duty required of a good Pa&s;tor; and having governed the church in tho&s;e parts mo&s;t happily the &s;pace of 17 years, he died in the <HI>I&s;le of Lindisfarne,</HI> the place he chu&s;ed for his re&s;idence, where he was al&s;o buried.</P>
<P>After his death, which happened in the year 651, <HI>Finianus</HI> was ordained Bi&s;hop, and &s;ent to the Northumbers, from Scotland.</P>

Their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in cattle, for money was no longer retained than till a fit oppor|tunity offered to di&s;tribute it to the poor.

audience, and when a Monk was &s;een entering a village on his travels, the inhabitants flocked about him, entreating for his admonitions and prayers.

<P>Wilfred was the preceptor of King <HI>Alfred;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many anecdotes of Wilfrid take place in the account given of Hexham and its Prelates.</NOTE> he was a Northumbrian by birth, and received his education at Lindisfarn: being recommended by Queen <HI>Eanfleda</HI> to a Nobleman called <HI>Cudda,</HI> who retired to this mo|na&s;tery, he attended him thither as his companion, and continued there from the 14th to the 18th year of his age. During this Prelate's epi&s;|copacy there happened great revolutions and changes in the See of <HI>Lin|disfarn;</HI> the death of King <HI>O&s;wy</HI> was only a part of the calamities which fell upon <HI>Northumberland</HI> in his time: <HI>Egfrid</HI> not only obtained the throne of the decea&s;ed Sovereign, but by his powerful intere&s;t and ef|forts depo&s;ed <HI>Alfred,</HI> a&s;&s;uming the &s;econd &s;cepter, and uniting the whole in one &s;overeignty. <HI>Wilfred</HI> was a proud a&s;piring man, and deba&s;ed the pall of the Prelate with ambition. He became obnoxious to Theo|dore, who determined to humble him, and in a &s;hort time got his de|po&s;ition effected. Theodore had great intere&s;t with <HI>Egfrid,</HI> which he u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, to gratify his malice and re&s;entment; and under that ordinary craft of Eccle&s;ia&s;tics, a &s;pecious pretence for the advance|ment of religion and the honour of the church, he obtained the royal mandate to divide <HI>the kingdom of Northumberland</HI> into two dioce&s;es, on a pre&s;umption that one Bi&s;hop had too much power and authority. This ancient dioce&s;e then underwent a &s;everance, and the two parts

Big with the &s;upreme mandate, he obtruded him&s;elf abruptly on the royal pre&s;ence; but to his great mortification, found the King exa&s;perated at his in&s;olence and impudent appeal: not being the va&s;&s;al of the See of Rome, he pro|fe&s;&s;ed his contempt of its commands, reproached <HI>Wilfred</HI> for having procured his credentials by bribery, and as a pre&s;umptuous offender again&s;t the royal dignity, he ca&s;t him into pri&s;on. His lamentable &s;i|tuation excited the interce&s;&s;ion of the devout <HI>Ebba,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>St. Ebba,</HI> daughter of <HI>Edilfrid</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> was Priore&s;s of <HI>Coldingham</HI> in Scotland.

He then fled to the court of <HI>Adelwack</HI> King of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> who&s;e &s;ubjects were ju&s;t receiving the light of conver&s;ion, and that King gave him a Bi&s;hopric called <HI>Sel&s;ey.</HI> Upon <HI>Egfrid</HI>'s demi&s;e, the crown of <HI>Northumberland</HI> de|volved upon <HI>Alfred;</HI> and <HI>Theodore</HI> declining in health and &s;trength, as he approached the grave in the &s;teps of old age, grew anxious to acquit or relieve his con&s;cience of the &s;everities he had exerci&s;ed again&s;t <HI>Wilfred,</HI> &s;ought to gain his friend&s;hip, and by his intere&s;t with the Crown and earne&s;t &s;olicitations, obtained his re&s;toration to the See of <HI>York. Wilfred</HI> had no &s;ooner rea&s;&s;umed his eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity, than his ungovern|able ambition and arrogance blazed out anew: the See of <HI>York,</HI> at his fir&s;t a&s;&s;umption of the epi&s;copal dignity, held in unity the kingdom of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> at his re&s;toration it was di&s;membered by a triple &s;eve|rance, by the di&s;unition of <HI>Lindisfarn</HI> and the new con&s;titution of <HI>Hex|ham. Wilfred</HI> made injudicious preten&s;ions and claims to effect a re|union, which &s;o exa&s;perated the King, and was a thing &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the politics of the times, that he was again expelled, and obliged to fly the realm. He now &s;ought refuge in the court of <HI>Mercia,</HI> where
<PB N="121" REF="125">
he won upon the ear of <HI>Etheldred,</HI> and gained from him the Bi&s;hopric of <HI>Leice&s;ter.</HI> Adver&s;ity is &s;aid to be the &s;chool of wi&s;dom, but it proved not &s;o with <HI>Wilfred;</HI> for in this new in&s;titution he conducted him&s;elf with that in&s;olence and impropriety, that he &s;oon incurred the di&s;plea|&s;ure of the Mercian King and the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who brought him to trial before a &s;ynod, and depo&s;ed him. He was now 70 years of age, and yet his powers were &s;o little debilitated, and his pa&s;&s;ions remained &s;o warm, that he again journeyed to Rome, and in &s;pite of the character of a turbulent and contentious Prelate, which he carried with him, obtained a decree for his re&s;toration. He returned a &s;econd time with the powers of Rome in his favour, and at a more favourable &s;ea&s;on to obtain the rewards of his labour. The Archbi&s;hop found it convenient at that time to adhere to the mandate of &s;upre|macy; the Mercian King had fallen into a &s;tate of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and a&s;|&s;umed the habit of a Monk; the King of <HI>Northumberland</HI> was under the attacks of a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, and feeling compunctions for the &s;uf|ferings <HI>Wilfred</HI> had undergone, became reconciled to him. Appearances were now much in the Prelate's favour, and the propitious hour &s;eemed to await him, but Fate &s;natched off <HI>Alfred</HI> before a re&s;toration was ef|fected. He obtained a council to be held upon the banks of the river <HI>Nidd,</HI> under the mandate of King <HI>O&s;red, Alfred</HI>'s &s;ucce&s;&s;or, where with great difficulty he gained the Bi&s;hoprick of Hexham, a &s;mall and mo|dern member of his former See.</P>

<P>"At which tyme I finde, that <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> was a &s;hepheard, and that in the dead of the night, he &s;aw the &s;oule of the &s;aid Bi&s;hop carryed up with great melody by a quire of angells into heaven; which heavenly vi&s;ion &s;oe &s;eaz'd upon his affection, that re&s;olving upon an holyer cour&s;e of life, he thought he could betake him&s;elf to noe better place then to the abby of <HI>Mail|ro&s;e,</HI> built by <HI>Aidanus</HI> upon the banks of <HI>Tweed;</HI> but the devill to cro&s;&s;e his good intent, meetes him in his journey, and after a good cudgeling, was glad to leave him; for proof whereof, in the &s;ame place to this day (if you will borrowe an optick-gla&s;s from &s;uper&s;tition) you may &s;ee the printe of his cloven foote: Neither did his valour, but al&s;o his humulitie appeare, when overtaken by night and hunger, he was forc'd to &s;uccour him&s;elfe under an old cottage, where he found noe other gue&s;t for entertainment, then an hor&s;e, which turning up the hay, di&s;co|vered a loafe of bread, at which the Saint right glad, &s;aid grace, and giving the hor&s;e one halfe, &s;atisfied him&s;elfe with the other, and the next day came to <HI>Mailro&s;e,</HI> where he had no &s;ooner entred, but <HI>Boy&s;ilus</HI> Prior of the abby, by a propheticall phi&s;iognomy, as if he had read in his face his &s;anctite, &s;olemnly receives him in his armes, and pre&s;ents him to <HI>Eata</HI> the Ab|bat, who committed him to <HI>Boy&s;ilus</HI> for his tutor, who taught him <HI>St. John's</HI> go&s;pell, in that booke, which in honour of the &s;chollar, was kept in the abby at Durham in Prior <HI>Turgots</HI> tyme, on which, after &s;oe many centuries of yeares, noe moth dur&s;t ever pre&s;ume to feede.</P>
<P>"In this abby, after he had &s;pent in the perfection of a mona&s;ticall life 15 yeares, he was prefer'd by <HI>Eata</HI> the Bi&s;hop, to the Priorie of <HI>Lindisfarne.</HI> In this <HI>Holy I&s;land</HI> (&s;o chri&s;tned in after ages for <HI>St. Cuthbert's</HI> &s;anctitie) &s;tood that renouned mona&s;tery founded by <HI>K.

<P>"In this i&s;land <HI>fourteen</HI> Bi&s;hops &s;ucce&s;&s;ively a&s;cended the epi&s;copall &s;eate; among whom, as a glorious &s;tarre of the fir&s;t magnitude, <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> &s;hyned in the firmament of this church; where after twelve yeares he had borne the dignity of the Prior&s;hip, he became a votary to an anachoreticall life, and choo&s;ed the i&s;land <HI>Farne,</HI> &s;eated in the maine ocean, for the place of his hermytage. This i&s;land as voyd of trees, water, and graine, as full of devills, became the &s;tage whereon <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> acted all his miracles; for at his arrival, the &s;pirits that frequented this i&s;le were put to &s;light, the rocks powred out their water, and as if there had beene a return of the golden age, the earth brought forth corne without tillage, with many more wonders, if they might bee reported upon the creditt of a legend: but the&s;e are enough to &s;hewe what ad|vantage
<PB N="124" REF="128">the Monkes took of the blind devotion of that age, who&s;e &s;tudy and whole practi&s;e was to devi&s;e and relate miracles of their Saints, which (as &s;uper&s;tition is alwaies credulous) were as ea&s;ily beleeved: Thus to gaine from the <HI>Pagans</HI> a reverend opinion of chri&s;tianity, they thought it but a pious fraud to co&s;en the people with volumes of wonders, who whiles they defended trueth by forgeries, their impo&s;tures di&s;cover'd to wi&s;er ages, have rather made reli|gion &s;u&s;pected, then any way advanced it: but if I &s;hould proceed in this di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hould leave <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> too &s;olitarie in his cell at <HI>Farne,</HI> where for want of other auditors, I finde him in the hi&s;tory preaching to birds that eate his corne, who &s;oe confuted them out of the text, with <HI>aliena non concupi&s;ces,</HI> that they never after touch'd his harve&s;t. In like manner he reclaymed two crowes from their wonted &s;tealing and rapine, that pull'd thatch of his ancho|rage for to build their ne&s;ts, and made them &s;o penitent, that they lay pro&s;trate at his feete for ab&s;olution.</P>
<P>"In this i&s;le he voluntarilye &s;uffer'd nine yeares impri&s;onment from the &s;ociety of men, &s;oe wholly devoted to heaven, that he remembred not he was upon earth, and for a whole yeare forgott to put off his &s;hoes: but he could not live &s;oe ob&s;curely in his cell, as his &s;ame was re|&s;plendent abroad; and in a &s;ynod at <HI>Alne upon Twy&s;ord</HI> he was in his ab&s;ence cho&s;en Bi&s;hop: This dignity was prophe&s;ied to him long before whiles he was a child, by an infant of three yeares old, who gravely reproved him, <HI>Fye Saint Cuthbert! what a Presbyter and a Bi&s;hop, and playing among boyes?</HI> as if at that tyme he had &s;eene him in his myter and cro&s;ier &s;taffe; but <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> had &s;o wedded his affection to a &s;olitary life, that neither letters nor emba&s;&s;adors from the &s;ynod could per&s;wade or command him to take upon him the government of the church, till King <HI>Egfrid</HI> him&s;elfe, attended with both the Lords temporall and &s;pirituall, &s;ayled to his hermytage, and with the &s;ame company might have be&s;ieged and taken a city whiles they were conquering his re&s;olution.</P>
<P>"The King to enlarge his dioce&s;&s;e gave him a great part of the city of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and the village of <HI>Creca</HI> with three miles compa&s;&s;e about it, as al&s;o the cittie of <HI>Carliel</HI> with the circuit of fif|teen miles about it: but for all this, <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> mind was &s;till on his anchorage, whither &s;hortly he betooke him&s;elfe againe, and in contempt of honour, edded his life in his cell. But it &s;hall be no part of his funerall pray&s;es thus to unman him&s;elfe to contemplate him&s;elfe into a God or <HI>Silvanus,</HI> for what was this el&s;e then to excommunicate him&s;elfe from the common|weale, and to finne again&s;t the definition of a man, to whom &s;ocietie is as naturall, as to bee a creature: and &s;urely religion cannot bee the motive of &s;uch an unnaturall act, but rather in all &s;uch anchorites a melancholy di&s;temper is u&s;ually mi&s;taken for devotion.</P>
<P>"His la&s;t will and te&s;tament was to his Monkes to bury him at the ea&s;t &s;ide of his oratory, in a coffin that venerable <HI>Cudda</HI> the Abbat gave him, which they &s;hould finde hid in the ground at the north &s;ide of his cell, and to putt his corps in the &s;hirt that <HI>Verca</HI> Abbate&s;&s;e of <HI>Tinmouth</HI> had &s;ent him for a token (which for the reverence of that holy woman he had never worn in his life time,) and la&s;tly, if the <HI>Pagans</HI> &s;hould invade them, and force them to flye, that they &s;hould carry with them his bones: All the&s;e de&s;ires were performed; onely at the weeping re|que&s;t of the Monkes, he permitted that his body &s;hould bee tran&s;ported to <HI>Lindisfarne,</HI> where in <HI>St. Peters</HI> church, at the right &s;ide of the high altar, he was &s;olemnly en&s;hrined anno domini 687.</P>
<P>"But to returne to <HI>Saint Cuthbert,</HI> who had now an eleven yeares lyen in his &s;epulchre, when the Monkes thought to place his bones, by this time drye and di&s;robed of fle&s;h, among their other reliques, for ki&s;&s;es and adoration: but behold a wonder! They looke for a &s;keleton, but found an entire body, with joints flexible, and fle&s;h &s;o &s;ucculent, that there onely wanted heate to make his body live without a &s;oule; nay his very funerall weedes were &s;o fre&s;h, as if putrefaction had not dared to pluck him by the coate. This was rather to pay his debt to hea|ven then to nature; who after he had re&s;tored his &s;oule to God, &s;hould keepe back the pay|ment
<PB N="125" REF="129">of his body from corruption. In other men it is true, that &s;leepe is the image of death, but here the grave &s;uffer'd a cheat, and death was the image of &s;leepe.</P>
<P>"This miracle <HI>St. Beda</HI> reports (who was an eleven yeares old at <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> death) in re|lating whereof he made no lye, but perhaps told one. The hi&s;tory of who&s;e life and death, he writ from the information of the Monkes of <HI>Lindisfarne,</HI> who had defloured all the miracles of Saints in holy writt, and be&s;towed them upon their <HI>St. Cuthbert;</HI> who, like man in paradi&s;e, had the bea&s;ts to doe him homage, and the &s;ea mon&s;ters to a&s;ke him ble&s;&s;ing: Like <HI>Abraham</HI> he entertayned three angells at the mona&s;terie of <HI>Rippon:</HI> A raven brought <HI>Elias</HI> fle&s;h, and an eagle brought <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> fi&s;h. As he &s;ayl'd with his mother from <HI>Ireland,</HI> his native &s;oyl, into <HI>Scotland,</HI> he lett the book of P&s;almes fall into the &s;ea, which forthwith was &s;wallowed up of a &s;ea calfe, and by the &s;ame fi&s;h delivered to them at their landing. Take here the p&s;alter for a man, and the &s;ea calfe for a whale, and you have the hi&s;tory of <HI>Ionas,</HI> with many &s;uch hi&s;tories of wonder, with which the Monkes delighted the &s;uper&s;tition of the times.</P>
<P>"After this illu&s;trious miracle of <HI>St. Cuthbert's</HI> incorruption, <HI>Lindisfarne</HI> rais'd it&s;elfe to that height of renowne, that <HI>Ceolwolphus</HI> the King, to whom <HI>Bede</HI> dedicates his Engli&s;h Hi&s;torie, re&s;igned an earthly crowne to gaine a cele&s;tiall one, and tooke upon him the habitt of a Monke in <HI>Lindisfarne;</HI> a welcome man you may be &s;ure to that mona&s;tery, for who&s;e &s;ake, it was graunted the Monkes there to drinke wine or ale, who before were onely to drinke milke or water, though they that dranke after <HI>Saint Cuthbert</HI> in his cupp, found &s;ometimes water turn'd into wyne without a miracle.</P>
<P>"Many kingly trea&s;ures did this devout Prince be&s;towe upon that mona&s;tery, with &s;uch large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as he &s;eem'd rather to re&s;igne his kingdome to the church than to his &s;ucce&s;&s;our, and became a Monke to make <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> a King: for he endowed that mona&s;tery with all the land betweene the rivers of <HI>Tees</HI> and <HI>Weer,</HI> and many townes and lord&s;hips, as <HI>Warkworth Ca&s;tle, Billingham, Gedworth,</HI> (where <HI>Ceolwolphus</HI> built the church,) and diver&s;e other villages, as <HI>Woodce&s;tre, Hutingham, Bre&s;gen, Edulingham,</HI> names that for ought I know, have outlived their townes, or townes that have chang'd their names.</P>
<P>"After the manife&s;tation of this miracle of bodily immortality after death. <HI>Eadfrid</HI> then Bi|&s;hop, cau&s;ed him to be lay'd in a new &s;epulchre, and to be advanced for &s;tate and reverence above the pavement in the &s;anctuary, for it was not fitt that he &s;hould have his grave among the dead, who&s;e body lived by &s;anctity when his &s;oule was gone.</P>
<P>"Now they began to wor&s;hip the very ground <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> had troad upon, who&s;e &s;anctity was &s;uch, that he made every place he came in a church; and <HI>Eadfrid</HI> in honour of <HI>St. Cuth|berts</HI> pre&s;ence, there built up his hermitage; where, as if a genius of &s;anctity had frequented that place, <HI>Ethelwald</HI> a Monke of <HI>Rippon</HI> lived an Hermite twelve yeares.</P>
<P>"Thus for a long tyme flouri&s;hed the Monkes of that church in great repute and pro&s;perity, till the <HI>Danes</HI> di&s;turbed their peace, who now began to make incur&s;ions upon the frontiers of this land, for many yeares continueing their piracies, till they had made a final conque&s;t, which at length yeilded to the <HI>Norman</HI> &s;word. Tho&s;e were the tymes, when &s;o many mona&s;teries (which the devotion of former ages had erected) had their funerals: then peri&s;hed that famous Emporium of <HI>Hartlepoole,</HI> where the religious <HI>Hieu</HI> built a nunnery, of which I may &s;peake as <HI>Hildebert</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI>
<Q>Quam magna fueras integra, fracta doces;</Q>
who&s;e ruines &s;hew how great &s;hee was in her glory, but now remayns to pa&s;&s;engers both a mo|nument of devotion and ho&s;tility: then were demoli&s;hed the two mona&s;teries of <HI>St. Peter</HI> and <HI>St. Paul</HI> at <HI>Weremouth</HI> and <HI>Jarrow,</HI> built by the reverend Abbats <HI>Celfrid</HI> and <HI>Benedict.</HI></P>
<P>"The furie of the <HI>Danes</HI> &s;till encrea&s;ing, continued by the &s;ea co&s;tes to <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> &s;o that it was now tyme for the Monkes of <HI>Lindisfarne</HI> to look about them; for they well under&s;tood by
<PB N="126" REF="130">the lamentable u&s;age of their neighbouring abbyes that the <HI>Danes</HI> would not, like the devill, bee affrighted with holy water, and &s;aw by the bad &s;ucce&s;&s;e of other mona&s;teries, that it was not &s;afe tru&s;ting to the protection of a Saint, and &s;o concluding upon flight, putting all their reliques into <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> coffin, they left the <HI>Pagans</HI> the &s;poyle of an empty church, anno Domini 893.</P>
<P>"It was <HI>Eardulphus</HI> his fortune to bee Bi&s;hop in the&s;e trouble&s;ome tymes, who with his whole Cleargy and families of People, followed this &s;acred bier; which, be&s;ides &s;eaven Monkes, as deputed E&s;quires of his body, none dur&s;t pre&s;ume to touch. The&s;e mi&s;eries had beene enough to have unfainted <HI>St Cuthbert,</HI> when pur&s;ued both by forreine foes, and overtaken with an home-bred enemy, famyne, he could afford them no releife. They were now come to the fir&s;t &s;ea, and might complaine as the old <HI>Brittanes</HI> did to <HI>Actius</HI> the Con&s;ull, <HI>Repellunt nos Barbari ad mare; repellit mare ad Barbaros; inter haec duo oriuntur genero functum, aut jugulamur, aut mergimur.</HI> But becau&s;e the di&s;re&s;pective &s;ea would not divide it&s;elfe at the approach of <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> the Bi&s;hop with &s;ome fewe of his Monkes, determin'd privily to &s;ayle over into <HI>Ire|land</HI> with his corps, that there he might finde re&s;t for his toumbe, where he fir&s;t had his birth. But they had not farre &s;ail'd from the &s;hore, but the winds and the &s;ea were both up in armes again&s;t their &s;hippe, which both <HI>Aeolus</HI> and <HI>Neptune</HI> might have reverenced for her &s;acred car|ryage of a Bi&s;hop and his Clergy: but the &s;ea roared &s;oe loud, that noe prayers for <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> could bee heard, but threaten'd them &s;o near with &s;hipwracke, as they had not that confidence in their Saint, as to encourage the marriners as Cae&s;ar did, <HI>Ne metues, Cuthbertum vehis!</HI> who now him&s;elf wanted &s;ome other Saint to invocate for helpe, and was in daunger to bee drowned after he was dead.

This &s;acrilegious &s;torme &s;trucke this &s;hippe with &s;uch a pal&s;ie, that it &s;hak't out the texts of the Evangeli&s;ts into the &s;ea: This book <HI>Eadfrid</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lindisfarne</HI> had writ out with his own hand, and <HI>Belfrid</HI> the Anchorite had curiou&s;ly paynted and guilded it, in which art the Monkes were admirably expert; not that I taxe in them this quality, but onely, it argued the Monkes were at great lea&s;ure. Thus, whether the &s;ea, as envying the land &s;uch a precious jewell as <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> or he him&s;elf to &s;hew his di&s;like for <HI>Ireland,</HI> had rai&s;ed this &s;torme, it was not long 'till in a calme they were carryed to the &s;hore from whence they &s;ett forth: but great &s;orrow you mu&s;t imagine was for the drowned booke, 'till one <HI>Hundredus</HI> (one of the &s;even that carryed the coffyn) was bid in a night vi&s;ion by <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> to goe &s;eeke it on the &s;hoare at <HI>Whitterne,</HI> where he found it in its former beautie and &s;plendour, which was kept in <HI>Prior Turgots</HI> tyme in Durham, in memory of the miracle; when the water &s;eem'd to run out of her&s;elfe to doe homage to <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> and would rather loo&s;e her nature then wett his book. If this were true, then I am &s;ure that <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> bookes had twice bet|ter fortune in the &s;ea, then they have now in his library at Durham, which was once a little vatican of choyce manu&s;cripts, but now rather a <GAP DESC="foreign"> than a library; rather a &s;epulcher f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r bookes, than a place to con&s;erve them: but this is the di&s;ea&s;e of mo&s;t church libraryes, &s;ince the inventing of printing, by which, men finding a more compendious way, and a cheaper pa&s;&s;age to &s;uperficial learning, have bequeathed old manu&s;cripts to the mothes and jackdawes, the onely &s;tudents at this day in &s;uch libraries.</P>
<P>"But to returne to the forenamed Monkes, who had another oracle by night from <HI>St. Cuth|bert,</HI> to repair to a certaine tree, whereon he &s;hould finde a bridle, at the &s;ight whereof, a dunne hor&s;e &s;hould proffer his &s;ervice (for ea&s;e of the Monkes) to drawe <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> body lay'd upon a wagon: but this was not to &s;teale an hor&s;e, becau&s;e it was an hor&s;e of <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="131">providing, the conduct whereof (as if he under&s;tood more of <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> minde than the re&s;t) they followed whither &s;oever he drew him, and at length, by the providence of the hor&s;e, they came to the mona&s;tery of <HI>Creca,</HI> where for foure moneths they were kindly entertayned by the Abbat and his Covent, and had lea&s;ure to tell &s;toryes of their travailes.</P>
<P>"From this abby, in a revelation by night, <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> &s;ent <HI>Aeadred</HI> Abbat of <HI>Luell,</HI> upon an emba&s;&s;age to the campe of the <HI>Danes,</HI> that they &s;hould crowne <HI>Guthredus</HI> King, whom they had &s;old to a widdow; a thing in tho&s;e days not practiced by the Pope to di&s;po&s;e of kingdomes. But what authority he had to nominate a King, or what rea&s;on they had to believe a dreame, mu&s;t be rank'd among&s;t <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> miracles: for <HI>Guthred</HI> thus to bee made a King, what was it el&s;e then to become <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> &s;ubject, and to oblige his royalty to tho&s;e Monkes that as boldly encroacht upon &s;oe fayre an advantage? For fir&s;t, they require the re&s;tauration of their epi&s;copal &s;eat in <HI>Cuncace&s;tre,</HI> where <HI>Eardulphus</HI> fir&s;t a&s;cended the pontifical chayre. And it was but another dreame, for the fore&s;ayd Abbot to goe to the King from <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> and bid him give all the lands betwixt <HI>Weer</HI> and <HI>Tyne</HI> for ever to his church. This mode&s;t reque&s;t mu&s;t bee graunted, or el&s;e the Monkes would be ready to upbrayd him with ingratitude. Ah poor Prince! to bee thus rob'd of his kingdome, and to receive a diademe, to &s;et it upon <HI>St. Cuth|berts</HI> head! Thus was the religious King cheated of his &s;overaignty by tho&s;e Monkes that had now got the art of an&s;laving the devotion of Princes to their private ends; for at this tyme al&s;o, the great <HI>Alfred</HI> &s;wore fealty to <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> and his Clergy, by who&s;e help they per&s;waded him, that he had got the victory over the <HI>Pagans.</HI> This made them bold al&s;o to a&s;k the privi|ledge of a &s;anctuary for their church, to re&s;kue offenders 37 dayes at <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> &s;epulchre, that neither Ju&s;tice &s;hould curbe the freedome of &s;inning, either again&s;t heaven or the &s;tate; for noe other u&s;e was commonly made of a&s;ylums, than, that men might offend more &s;ecurely, and di&s;loyally appeal from the King and the Lawes to the protection of a Saint. Neither was this enough, 'till King <HI>Alfred</HI> mu&s;t by his royal charter free the inhabitants of <HI>St. Cuthberts</HI> lande from tribute to the King, which he &s;ealed with fearful anathem's to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, that &s;hould infringe the &s;aid liberties. What el&s;e was this, than for a King to bee a Traitour to his own Maje&s;ty, and deprive him&s;elf of that &s;ervice, which even by the law of nature is due from a Subject to his Prince.</P>
<P>"Now in what reverend e&s;teem this Saint was to King <HI>Alfred,</HI> I gather from the con&s;ecra|tion of the chappel to <HI>St Cuthbert</HI> in <HI>Univer&s;ity Colledge</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he is &s;aid to bee the fir&s;t founder: in an antient window whereof <HI>King Alfred</HI> and <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> are painted together, the King be&s;peaking the Saint in a pentameter,
<Q>Hic in honore tui Collegium &s;tatui;</Q>
and <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> thus replying in an hexameter,
<Q>Quod &s;tatui&s;ti in eo, pervertentes maledico;</Q>
and by &s;uch cur&s;es, the Monks maintayn'd their lands in a better tenure than under the Kings broad &s;eale. The like malediction you may read in a di&s;tick in <HI>Trinity Colledge</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> en|graven in wooden letters over the &s;creene,

<P>"Thus after <HI>Eardulphus</HI> (the la&s;t Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lindisfarne,</HI> and the fir&s;t of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI>) had &s;hared with <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> both in his pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, and had &s;eene this new church &s;prung up like a phoenix out of the a&s;hes of the former, he ended his life in a full age, and was &s;o|lemnely enterred anno Domini 894; in which yeare al&s;o died the victorious <HI>Alfred,</HI> who on his death bedd, bequeathed his love of <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> as a precious legacy to his &s;onne <HI>Edward,</HI>

<P>This life of &s;everity excited the reverence and admiration of tho&s;e ages of ignorance. Whether enthu&s;ia&s;m alone could determine the hu|man mind to &s;uch undertakings, or there was a degree of pride mixed in the influenza, I cannnot determine. The vices of tho&s;e times, I pre|&s;ume, were not attended with &s;uch degrees of de&s;pair as are unknown to us; the inducements mu&s;t have been more complicated than the out|ward countenance of piety expre&s;&s;ed. How different the manners of the religious of the &s;ame church in modern times. <Q>An ambitious or hypocritical religious, who makes a profe&s;&s;ion of humility, whil&s;t he is puffed up with pride; a man meanly clad, and who only &s;eeks after riches; a pretender to devotion, who gives him&s;elf out as a &s;ervant of God, while he is no more than a &s;lave to his pa&s;&s;ions, is a mon&s;ter both in church and &s;tate.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Every intriguing Monk or Friar, who thru&s;ts him&s;elf into families, for the purpo&s;e of prying into &s;ecrets, regulating marriages or wills, is as de&s;picable as he is dangerous.</Q>&mdash; The&s;e are the liberal &s;entiments of the immortal Ganganelli, Pope Cle|ment XIV. who&s;e works have placed the Romi&s;h church in a more amiable point of view, than it has appeared in &s;everal pa&s;t ages.</P>
<P>I have frequently ruminated on man's &s;everal affections, and this &s;e|verity of <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI>'s re&s;tores to my memory &s;ome di&s;tant ideas. I have always con&s;idered <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> as comprehending the mo&s;t excellent feelings of the human heart: how a &s;ocial and generous-minded man could live without the enjoyment of friend&s;hip, and totally withdraw him&s;elf from all attachments with the world, is to me truly a &s;everity little to be comprehended. I pre&s;ume the Saint mu&s;t have held the
<PB N="131" REF="135">
very argument <HI>Mr Hume</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume's Ea&s;&s;ays. Nat. Hi&s;t. of Religion, vol. 2. p. 469.</NOTE> adopts to account for the au&s;terities of &s;u|per&s;titious men. <Q>Nor is it &s;atisfactory to &s;ay, that the practice of morality is more difficult than that of &s;uper&s;tition; and is therefore rejected. For, not to mention the exce&s;&s;ive pennances of the <HI>Bach|man</HI>'s and <HI>Talaponis;</HI> it is certain, that the <HI>Rhamadan</HI> of the <HI>Turks,</HI> during which the poor wretches, for many days, often in the hotte&s;t months of the year, and in &s;ome of the hotte&s;t climates in the world, remain without eating or drinking from the ri&s;ing to the &s;etting &s;un; this <HI>Rhamadan,</HI> I &s;ay, mu&s;t be more &s;evere than the practice of any moral duty, even to the mo&s;t vicious and depraved of mankind. The four Lents of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and the au&s;teries of &s;ome <HI>Roman Catho|licks,</HI> appear more di&s;agreeable than <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> and <HI>benevolence.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Perhaps, the following account may be received as a true &s;olution of the difficulty. The duties which a man performs as a friend or parent, &s;eem meerly owing to his benefactor or children; nor can he be wanting to the&s;e duties, without breaking through all the ties of nature and morality. A &s;trong inclination may prompt him to the performance: a &s;entiment of order and moral obligation joins its force to the&s;e natural ties: and the whole man is truly virtuous, is drawn to his duty, without any effort or endeavour. Even with re|gard to the virtues, which are more au&s;tere, and more founded on reflection, &s;uch as public &s;pirit, filial duty, temperance, or integrity; the moral obligation, in our apprehen&s;ion, remove all preten&s;ion to religious merit; and the virtuous conduct is deemed no more, than what we owe to &s;ociety and to our&s;elves. In all this, a &s;uper&s;titious man finds nothing, which he has properly performed for the &s;ake of his Deity, or which can peculiarly recommend him to the divine fa|vour and protection. He con&s;iders not, that the mo&s;t genuine me|thod of &s;erving the Divinity, is by promoting the happine&s;s of his creatures. He &s;till looks out for &s;ome more immediate &s;ervice of the Supreme Being, in order to allay tho&s;e terrors, with which he is haunted. And any practice, recommended to him, which either &s;erves to no purpo&s;e in life, or offers the &s;tronge&s;t violence to his na|tural inclinations; that practice he will the more readily embrace, on account of tho&s;e very circum&s;tances, which &s;hould make him ab|&s;olutely reject it. It &s;eems the more purely religious, becau&s;e it pro|ceeds
<PB N="132" REF="136">
from no mixture of any other motive or con&s;ideration. And if, for its &s;ake, he &s;acrifices much of his ea&s;e and quiet, his claim of merit appears &s;till to ri&s;e upon him, in proportion to the zeal and devotion which he di&s;covers. In re&s;toring a loan, or paying a debt, his Divinity is in no wi&s;e beholden to him; becau&s;e the&s;e acts of ju&s;tice are what he was bound to perform, and what many would have performed, were there no God in the univer&s;e. But if he fa&s;t a a day, or give him&s;elf a &s;ound whipping; this has a direct reference, in his opinion, to the &s;ervice of God. No other motive could engage him to &s;uch au&s;terities. By the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of devotion, he has now acquired the divine favour; and may expect, in recompence, protection and &s;afety in this world, and eternal happine&s;s in the next.</Q></P>
<P>But I will quit this review, to return to the more intere&s;ting features of <HI>Friend&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>If we compare <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> to the other affections of man, we &s;ee <HI>Love</HI> has a powerful influence on the human heart; but its bounds are con|fined, and its conclu&s;ions &s;elfi&s;h; it has but one object to po&s;&s;e&s;s: its attachments are rigorous indeed, but full of prejudice; and its whole influence centers in an <HI>Egoity,</HI> wherein genero&s;ity and honour lo&s;e much of their lu&s;tre.</P>
<P><HI>Gratitude</HI> is an excellent operation of the &s;oul; our obligations are therein duly e&s;timated: it is a confe&s;&s;ion of our former indigence; and &s;elf-importance is refined by &s;uch humiliation: it depends on the com|pari&s;on which is drawn, between our own wants and the bounty re|ceived. <HI>Gratitude</HI> is a branch of <HI>moral hone&s;ty,</HI> a confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>the debt of obligation.</HI></P>
<P>Yet <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> is abundantly &s;uperior to <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Gratitude;</HI> it is an affection of the heart, in which <HI>Benevolence</HI> pre&s;ides: it is accompanied by an openne&s;s of mind, wherein <HI>Genero&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> are exemplary, without &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or price, or con&s;ideration of reward. In <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> the bo&s;om is expanded and elated; &s;ecrecy, guile, and concealment are expelled; and probity, truth, and virtue reign in their place. There is an energy in <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> to which every faculty contributes: it fires the &s;oul with fervour, and fills the heart with gladne&s;s. You act there|in, from the &s;ame principles, as would conduct your own neare&s;t and mo&s;t momentous affairs: it is that <HI>divine perfection,</HI> to which we are
<PB N="133" REF="137">
peculiarly exhorted: <HI>Love your neighbour as your&s;elf.</HI> With our friend all di&s;gui&s;e is thrown off; the political gui&s;e of politene&s;s, which ma&s;ks &s;incerity, is taken away; the heart leaps with affection; the eyes gaze with rapture, approbation, and e&s;teem; the countenance glows with expre&s;&s;ions of delight; the bo&s;om is unlocked, the trea&s;ures of the bo|&s;om are thrown abroad; you fear no treachery, you are open and con|fident; you communicate with the &s;ame joy you receive in&s;truction, and all is plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Such were the feelings my youth experienced in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a friend. How often hath the young mind hung enraptured in the a&s;&s;o|ciation of my friend. The cordiality that then took place was as dear as life. Riper manhood hath retained the whole, though in a graver degree.</P>
<P>I think I hear the Saint reply, <Q>the warmth of our &s;ociability freezes up with declining youth, our cordiality cools as age advances, and our openne&s;s of heart decrea&s;es, as the frauds of mankind, and di&s;|appointments of life, advance upon experience: we grow afraid of the hidden dangers our confidence hath often prompted; and we gra|dually trea&s;ure up in our memories, the le&s;&s;ons of example, and the inferences of experience; which, like the &s;epulchres of the dead, only remind us how many friends are departed, how many di&s;a&s;ters are incident to life, how little dependence there is on man, and how vain is all human confidence in the things of this world.</Q></P>
<P>If &s;uch is the con&s;equence of age; if the delightful ta&s;te of <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> pa&s;&s;eth away; I will cling to the departing foot&s;teps, I will gra&s;p at the &s;acred verge, from whence to fall, is to depart from the fir&s;t, and the fine&s;t enjoyment of human life; the only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion on earth, which gives an idea of the communion of angels.</P>

<P>Thus, after nine years continuance of a &s;olitary life in the I&s;le of Farne, was this pious man induced to a&s;&s;ume an epi&s;copal duty.

<P>Some &s;hort time preceding the con&s;ecration of <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> the mo|na&s;tery of <HI>Coldingham</HI> was con&s;umed by fire. The religious &s;ociety of this hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of Monks and Nuns,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This a&s;&s;ociation of Monks and Nuns is &s;aid to be grounded on the words of our Saviour, John xix. 26, 27.</NOTE> who occupied &s;eparate parts of the edifice; but the &s;everities of a devoted life, and the &s;trict rules profe&s;&s;ed in &s;uch &s;ocieties, were not &s;ufficient to prevent a &s;hameful re|laxation of di&s;cipline, and many gro&s;s abu&s;es and enormities took place; in&s;omuch, that the de&s;truction of this &s;tately edifice was regarded as a judgment, for the crimes and pollutions of its inhabitants. The mo|na&s;tery of <HI>Lindisfarn</HI> looked upon the event with religious horror, and &s;oon after <HI>Cuthbert</HI> was made Bi&s;hop, he forbid the approach of women to the convent, and even denied them acce&s;s to the church where the Monks performed their devotions: he cau&s;ed a &s;mall chapel to be erected in a di&s;tant plain on the i&s;land for the reception of the female &s;ex, from its &s;ituation taking the name of Greenchurch. From thenceforth the women were excluded the churches or cemeteries where St. <HI>Cuthbert</HI>'s body re&s;ted; and &s;ome miraculous puni&s;hments are related which at|tended infringements on this injunction. In the cathedral church at Durham the pavement is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a cro&s;s of black marble, be|yond which women were not allowed to advance towards the choir.</P>
<P><HI>Cuthbert</HI> enjoyed his change of life and dignities but a very &s;hort time, for within two years finding his health declining, and his mind being by habit tempered more for &s;olitude and &s;ilence than the duties of this high office, he re&s;igned the See, and returned to his cell in <HI>Farne,</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="140">
where he &s;urvived only two months, yielding his &s;pirit to God on the 20th day of May, 687, in the 53d year of the creation of the See of <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> and 37 years after he had a&s;&s;umed the mona&s;tic habit at <HI>Mailro&s;s.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>He directed by his la&s;t will, that his body &s;hould be buried at the ea&s;t end of the oratory, in a &s;tone coffin given him by the holy <HI>Tuda,</HI> and wrapped up in a &s;heet pre&s;ented him as a token by <HI>Virca</HI> Abbe&s;s of Tynemouth, which out of reverence to that holy woman he had never u&s;ed: and la&s;tly, if the i&s;land &s;hould be invaded by Pagans, he ordered the Monks to fly from them, and carry his bones away with them. The&s;e directions were none of them performed, his body was tran&s;ported to Lindisfarn, where in St. Peter's church, at the right &s;ide of the high altar, he was &s;olemnly laid in a tomb of &s;tone; but the Monks left behind them the coffin for which he expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch regard, which &s;till continues to be &s;hewn at Farne I&s;land, and it is highly probable they were not more mindful of the &s;heet</P>

<P>Mr Wallis &s;peaking of this portrait, has the following remarks. <Q>King Alfred preferred the&s;e characters to the Saxon, and when he &s;wayed the &s;cepter, brought them in u&s;e. This curious memorial of St. Cuthbert was found in the very place of that glorious Monarch's re|treat and deliverance from the Danes, fortified by him in the time of war, and in time of peace converted into a mona&s;tery. Dr. Mu&s;grave thinks this curious <HI>Cimolium</HI> an undeni|able in&s;tance of the u&s;e of images coming from the heathens into the chri&s;tian church.</Q></P>
<P>St. Cuthbert's &s;hrine had the privilege of &s;anctuary, where fugitives were &s;afe for 37 days. This re&s;pite allowed criminals a time for making re&s;titution, or under the feudal laws they would have &s;uffered immediate pains and puni&s;hments: it was the proce&s;s by which the rigour of common law was moderated; and when kept in due re&s;traint was of great benefit to man|kind: but by an enormous exten&s;ion which took place, it produced infinite mi&s;chiefs to the community and to the &s;tate.</P></NOTE></P>

We expre&s;&s;ed our anxiety at the increa&s;ing waters, yet not daring to leave our guide, on account of the intercepting gullies, and the apprehen&s;ion of quick&s;ands, of the &s;ituation and nature of which we were totally ignorant.

<P>who&s;e venerable remains give the traveller an idea of the &s;tate of pa|laces and &s;trongholds, in the remote&s;t aera of our <HI>Saxon ance&s;tors</HI> in Bri|tain. The &s;cite of this fortre&s;s is on the crown of a high rock, trian|gular in figure, one of the points projecting into the &s;ea. Many of the buildings &s;tand on the very brink of the rocks, to the land &s;ide: the a&s;pect towards the &s;ea is very lofty, being near 150 perpendicular feet above the level of low water mark. Part of the mo&s;t ancient fortifica|tions on the land &s;ide are broken and defaced, by the falling of the cliffs on which they were erected, the &s;ame con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;oft red &s;tone, which peri&s;hes much by the weather. On this &s;ide a circular tower remains, of very antique con&s;truction, its ba&s;e projecting in &s;e|veral tiers. Many of the other buildings appear to be the work of more modern ages, till you approach the gate-way, which is on the only ac|ce&s;&s;ible part of the rock; it was defended by a deep ditch, cut through a narrow neck communicating with the main land, having a draw bridge: this lays to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and on the brink of the precipice above the &s;ea &s;hore. The gate-way is &s;trengthened by a round tower on each &s;ide, from whence pa&s;&s;ing about 12 paces, which &s;pace appears to have been formerly a covered way, you approach a &s;econd and machicolated gate, of a much more modern order of building, having a port-culice. After you have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;econd gate, on the left hand, on a lofty point of the rock, &s;tands a very ancient round tower, of great &s;trength, commanding the pa&s;s. A&s;&s;ailants having won this approach, entered upon a &s;ituation of imminent danger on a tremendous precipice, &s;ub|ject to every kind of annoyance from the be&s;ieged, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the round tower. This part of the fortre&s;s wears the mo&s;t ancient coun|tenance, and challenges the Saxons for its origin. The ingenious Mr

Gro&s;e &s;ays, <Q>this is the &s;pot where, according to the Monki&s;h Hi&s;to|rians, &s;tood the ca&s;tle or palace of the Kings of Northumberland; built, as it &s;aid, by King Ida, who began his reign A. D. 559. Part of the pre&s;ent ruins are by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed to be the remains of King Ida's work.</Q>&mdash;<Q>On the whole, though there was undoubtedly a for|tre&s;s or palace here in the Saxon times, and perhaps earlier, every part of the pre&s;ent buildings, &s;eems to have been the work of the Normans.</Q> On what circum&s;tances Mr Gro&s;e grounds this general determination, I cannot di&s;cover: mo&s;t of the northern Norman &s;truc|tures are of excellent ma&s;onry; the buildings here are various in figure, materials, modes of arching, windows, ba&s;es, and other parts. The round tower I have noted is different in all tho&s;e matters, from the greate&s;t part of the works; and it is to a common ob&s;erver marked with much greater antiquity than the Keep or main tower, which I &s;hall next de&s;cribe. It is impo&s;&s;ible to prevent a di&s;agreement in opinion on &s;ubjects of this kind; where there is no certain rule to fix determi|nation, it mu&s;t be the ca&s;e: I pay the greate&s;t deference to Mr Gro&s;e's judgment, but think he has pa&s;&s;ed this determination ha&s;tily. The Keep or chief tower of this fortre&s;s is a lofty &s;quare &s;tructure, of the &s;ame model with many Norman fortre&s;&s;es founded in or near the time of the Conqueror; it &s;tands on the crown of the rock, having an open area round it, but mo&s;t exten&s;ive towards the north and north-ea&s;t points. Mr Wallis &s;ays, that from the &s;tile of the architecture of its ba&s;e, being of the Doric order, it is believed to be of Roman work. He adds, <Q>that it is well known the Saxons erected their ca&s;tles when they could on Roman foundations, and gave them the name of Burg or Brough.</Q> It is very probable the Romans held this part of the country, to be of &s;ingular importance to their navy; but that they built ca&s;tles here, is not by any means admi&s;&s;ible. They might erect &s;mall towers, like tho&s;e who&s;e remains appear on the wall of Severus, on places of &s;pecial import. I do not doubt the Saxons would enter upon the Roman for|tifications, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons the Normans after them made &s;uch choice: the northern counties furni&s;h a multitude of in&s;tances that the Normans po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of &s;uch &s;ituations; but in tho&s;e places the Roman vallum and fo&s;s only &s;erved for outworks to the Nor|man &s;tructures. The remains of the Roman &s;tation are vi&s;ible at many of tho&s;e fortre&s;&s;es. In mo&s;t of the places I have ob&s;erved, the Roman works are retained as a platform or outward area, to the &s;outh &s;ides of the ca&s;tles. In the northern &s;tations, of the large&s;t &s;ize, there are no re|mains of ca&s;tles. Whether the Saxons or Normans entered upon tho&s;e
<PB N="156" REF="161">
places, I do not pre&s;ume to determine. The &s;cite of the Praetorium is to be traced in many, but without any other appearances, than of erections for dome&s;tic u&s;es, not &s;hewing a &s;ufficient quantity of ruins, to give the lea&s;t idea of a decayed ca&s;tle. Mr Gro&s;e &s;ays, <Q>&s;ome a&s;&s;ert the Keep to have been a Roman &s;tructure, for which &s;uppo&s;ition they give the following rea&s;ons; its great &s;imilarity to the Keep of Dover Ca&s;tle, and the White Tower of London, both allowed to be Roman &mdash;the &s;hape of its arches, which are either flat or &s;emicircular&mdash;a Doric ba&s;e round its bottom, and the great depth of its well, &s;unk 75 feet, through a whin&s;tone rock.&mdash;The fir&s;t of the&s;e is evidently founded on a mi&s;take, neither the White Tower nor the Keep of Dover Ca&s;tle being Roman, but built &s;ince the conque&s;t; the la&s;t in the time of King Henry II. proofs of which are to be met with in Dugdale's Mona&s;ticon, the Textus Roffen&s;is, and divers other authentic records. Nor is the proof drawn from the &s;hape of its arches more conclu&s;ive; &s;emicircular and flat arches are found in almo&s;t every building erected before the time of King Henry II. and from the argument deduced from its Doric ba&s;e, it is not at all wonderful or uncommon, to find the members of Graecian architecture employed in Norman buildings. One in&s;tance of this, among many, may be &s;een at the cathedral of Canterbury, where a ma&s;&s;ive column, placed in the under-croft, to &s;upport &s;ome va&s;t weight, has a rude &s;ort of Ionic capital. Be&s;ides it is well known mo&s;t of the architects of tho&s;e days learned their art at Rome, where they had the Graecian architecture continually before them; of which indeed the Saxon was only a deba&s;ed kind. After the &s;tupendous works carried on by our Norman ance&s;tors, it &s;eems extraordinary, that the digging of the above-mentioned well &s;hould appear &s;o arduous an undertaking, as to be deemed po&s;&s;ible to the Romans only. Be&s;ides, in Bee&s;ton Ca&s;tle, Che&s;hire, there is a well full as deep, cut through the &s;olid rock: and that is univer&s;ally known to be the work of the Normans.</Q></P>
<P>The following remarks, extracted from the &s;ame work, will not be unacceptable to the reader: <Q>The &s;tones with which the Keep or great tower is built, are remarkably &s;mall, and were taken from a quarry three miles di&s;tant. From their &s;mallne&s;s it has been conjectured they were brought hither on the backs of men or hor&s;es. The walls to the front are 11 feet thick, but the other three &s;ides are only nine. The original roof was placed no higher than the top of the &s;econd &s;tory. The rea&s;on for the &s;ide walls being carried &s;o much higher
<PB N="157" REF="162">
than the roof, might be for the &s;ake of defence, or to command a more exten&s;ive look-out, both towards the &s;ea and land. The tower was however afterwards covered at the top. Here were no chimneys, the only fire place in it was a grate in the middle of a large room, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the guard room, where &s;ome &s;tones in the middle of the floor are burned red. This floor was all of &s;tone, &s;up|ported by arches. This room had a window in it near the top, three feet &s;quare, intended to let out the &s;moke. All the other rooms were lighted by &s;lits or chinks in the walls, &s;ix inches broad. The out|works are built of a very different &s;tone from that of the Keep, being a coar&s;e free &s;tone of an inferior quality, ill abiding the injuries of weather; taken from the rock it&s;elf. In all the principal rooms in the outworks there are chimneys, particularly in the kitchen, which mea&s;ures 40 feet by 30 feet, where there are three very large ones, and four windows; over each window is a &s;tone funnel, like a chim|ney open at the top, intended as it is &s;uppo&s;ed to carry off the &s;team. In a narrow pa&s;&s;age near the top of the Keep was found upwards of 50 iron heads of arrows, ru&s;ted together into a ma&s;s; the longe&s;t of them about 7&frac12; inches. In December 1770, in &s;inking the floor of the cellar, the draw well was accidentally found: its depth is 145 feet, cut through the &s;olid rock, of which 75 feet is of hard whin-&s;tone. In the &s;ummer of the year 1773, in throwing over the bank a prodigious quantity of &s;and, the remains of the chapel were di&s;covered, in length 100 feet. The chancel is now quite cleared, is 36 feet long and 20 feet broad; the ea&s;t end, according to the Saxon fa&s;hion, &s;emicir|cular. The altar, which has been likewi&s;e found, did not &s;tand clo&s;e to the ea&s;t end, but in the center of the &s;emicircle, with a walk about it, three feet broad, left for the Prie&s;t to carry the Ho&s;t in proce&s;&s;ion. The font, richly carved, is al&s;o remaining.</Q></P>

He gained an advantageous po&s;t, and with great bravery made &s;uch an attack upon the undi&s;ciplined Scots, that they were &s;oon thrown into confu&s;ion, and after &s;uffering a dreadful &s;laughter, made an inglorious conclu&s;ion of their inva&s;ion, by a precipitate retreat into their own country. <HI>Uchtred</HI> did not conduct his &s;ucce&s;s with temperance; he &s;ullied his victory with cruelty, inhu|manly &s;laughtering in cold blood, the nobility and officers of rank which were among his pri&s;oners, their heads becoming the horrid fur|niture of the walls of <HI>Durham.</HI> King <HI>Ethelred</HI> overlooked this barba|rity, and rewarded his valour by giving him in marriage his daughter <HI>Edgiva,</HI> with a princely portion; his father re&s;igning his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to the young hero, the King added thereto the county of <HI>York.</HI> The &s;a|vage barbarity of tho&s;e times is &s;hocking to humanity; there was &s;el|dom a victory obtained in the reciprocal depredations made on the

borders, but the utmo&s;t cruelty and undi&s;tingui&s;hed &s;laughter was the con&s;equence. The warfare it&s;elf was infamous; for it was no better than robbing by a Banditti commanded by Kings, who &s;ullied the lu&s;tre of a Crown by impious acts which will for ever remain ignomi|nious in &s;tory.</P>

<PB N="164" REF="169">
Irritated at this injury, <HI>Fitz-John</HI> attached him&s;elf to <HI>David</HI> King of Scotland, and levied a great force from his barony of <HI>Alnwick,</HI> with which he openly joined the Scotch invader. They marched towards <HI>Bambrough,</HI> and made a regular attack; but &s;o far from being able to po&s;&s;e&s;s the place, they only forced an outwork, which had been lately erected, and put to the &s;word about 100 of the defenders, by who&s;e re|proachful &s;peeches they were irritated to the a&s;&s;ault. After de&s;troying the corn, hamlets, and erections in the adjacent country, they marched &s;outhward; and in the county of <HI>Durham</HI> being joined by a large body
<PB N="165" REF="170">
of forces from <HI>Galloway</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> with <HI>King David</HI> at their head, they advanced to <HI>Northallerton,</HI> and &s;oon after were defeated at the battle of <HI>the &s;tandard.</HI></P>
<P>In the conditions of peace made between King Stephen and King David I. of Scotland, it was &s;tipulated, that the earldom of Northum|berland &s;hould be conclu&s;ively &s;ettled on Prince Henry, David's &s;on, with all its appendages, except <HI>Bambrough</HI> and <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> which the Engli&s;h Monarch was to retain on Henry's receiving a compen&s;ation by lands in the &s;outh of England. All the Barons within this earldom did homage to Prince Henry for their e&s;tates, with a &s;alvo for the fealty they had &s;worn to King Stephen, it having al&s;o been premi&s;ed, that the laws and cu&s;toms e&s;tabli&s;hed by King Henry I. in Northumberland &s;hould remain in force. This treaty was ratified at Durham, in the month of April, A. D. 1139, in the pre&s;ence of Maude Queen of Eng|land and a great a&s;&s;embly of the Barons of both nations; and there|upon the King of Scotland and his &s;on entered into compact for the maintenance of peace with England during their lives; for the ob&s;erv|ance of which Co&s;patric Earl of March, Hugh de Morvill, Fergus Mel and Mac were given as ho&s;tages.</P>
<P>King Henry II. in the third year of his reign, had re&s;tored to him, by Malcolm IV. King of Scotland, the northern territories which King Stephen had granted to David King of Scotland: and therewith King Henry was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city of Carli&s;le, the ca&s;tle of Bam|brough, and Newca&s;tle upon Tyne. It is pre&s;umed by &s;ome authors, that David having taken advantage of the broils in which King Ste|phen was involved, had &s;eized the ca&s;tle of Bambrough; as in the treaty when the earldom of Northumberland was re&s;igned to Prince Henry, this fortre&s;s and Newca&s;tle were expre&s;sly re&s;erved to the Crown of England.</P>
<P>In the 16th year of <HI>King Henry the Second's</HI> reign, &s;ome great work &s;eems to have been added to this fortre&s;s, as in Madox's Hi&s;tory of the Exchequer, under the article of Amercements, it appears one <HI>William,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Waldef,</HI> was fined five marks for refu&s;ing his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the King's works at <HI>Baenburg Ca&s;tle:</HI> he was fined al&s;o 40s. to have a re|&s;pite touching the &s;aid works.

<P><HI>William Heron,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Jordan Heron,</HI> who held a barony in this county by the &s;ervice of one Knight's fee, as his ance&s;tors had done from the conque&s;t, was in the 32d year of King Henry III. con&s;tituted Governor of <HI>Bambrough Ca&s;tle,</HI> and of <HI>Pickering</HI> and <HI>Scarbrough,</HI> in York&s;hire: in which appointments he was &s;ucceeded in the 37th year of the &s;ame reign, by <HI>John Lexington,</HI> Knt.

<P>In 1296, King Edward I. &s;ummoned <HI>John Baliol,</HI> King of Scotland to renew his homage at this ca&s;tle; but the proud va&s;&s;al forgetting his fidelity, contemned the command, and levied an army to re&s;i&s;t the Engli&s;h arms, if Edward entered his kingdom.

<P><Q>Other apartments are fitted up for &s;hipwrecked &s;ailors, and bedding is provided for 30, &s;hould &s;uch a number happen to be ca&s;t on &s;hore at the &s;ame time. A con&s;tant patrol is kept every &s;tormy night along this tempe&s;tuous coa&s;t, for above 8 miles, the length of the manor, by which means numbers of lives have been pre&s;erved.

In every great &s;torm, two men on hor&s;eback are &s;ent from the ca&s;tle to patrol along the coa&s;t, from &s;un-&s;et to &s;un-ri&s;e, that, in ca&s;e of an accident, one may remain by the &s;hip, and other return to alarm the ca&s;tle.

<P>So exten&s;ive a charity, to flow from a private bounty, is &s;ingular: men in former ages were canonized for trifling acts of benevolence, compared to this. But although the re&s;ources were given by Lord Crew, yet the di&s;po&s;ition was not of his arrangement; to the benevo|lent heart of <HI>the Rev. Dr Sharp,</HI> the chief part of the ble&s;&s;ings derived from his Lord&s;hip's will is to be attributed. He re&s;ides many months in each year in <HI>the ca&s;tle of Bambrough,</HI> &s;uperintends the works of charity, has his eye open upon every new channel by which he may give relief or con&s;olation to his &s;uffering fellow-creatures. The &s;hipwrecked and the di&s;ea&s;ed are comforted by his vi&s;itation, and the calamities of life
<PB N="179" REF="184">
are all alleviated by his care. It is an exalted duty; the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits of heaven are de&s;cribed to us as di&s;pen&s;ing the gifts of univer&s;al bene|volence.</P>

<P>po&s;&s;e&s;s little matter of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to tempt a traveller to &s;ea, e&s;pecially where there is &s;o con&s;tant a ripling and breaking of the waves, as is to be found between them and the continent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The effect of oil on troubled waters, mentioned lately as a modern and accidental di&s;co|very, was known in very di&s;tant ages: it was practi&s;ed in this country, and e&s;teemed a miracle. Indeed mo&s;t of the miraculous works of the religious were deduced from &s;ome knowledge of the &s;imple&s;t principles of nature, di&s;covered and di&s;played in ages of profound ignorance. In Bede's third book of the hi&s;tory of the Church of England, touching the miracles wrought by Aidan, this practice is thus mentioned. <Q>A certain prie&s;t named <HI>Utta,</HI> a man of great gra|vity and &s;incerity, and one who for his qualities and truth was well e&s;teemed, was commi&s;|&s;ioned to go into Kent, for <HI>Eanflede,</HI> King <HI>Edwine</HI>'s daughter, who after her father's death had been &s;ent thither, in order to her e&s;pou&s;al with King <HI>O&s;win.</HI> He was to travel by land to Kent, but to return by &s;ea; on which account he addre&s;&s;ed Bi&s;hop Aidan, be&s;eeching him to put up fervent prayers to God to pro&s;per their Voyage. The Bi&s;hop gave them his ble&s;|&s;ing, and having recommended them devoutly to the protection of God, he al&s;o delivered to Utta &s;ome jars of hallowed oil, &s;aying, I fore&s;ee that whil&s;t you are at &s;ea, a &s;udden tempe&s;t will come upon you; remember to ca&s;t into the troubled waters the oil that I give you, and and &s;peedily the tempe&s;t &s;hall be a&s;&s;uaged, the &s;ea be calmed, and you &s;hall have a plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age. All the&s;e things were fulfilled according to the prophecy. At the beginning of the tempe&s;t, when the waves and &s;urges chiefly raged, the &s;ailors endeavoured in vain to ca&s;t anchor; but the &s;torm increa&s;ed, and the waves multiplied &s;o fa&s;t, that the ve&s;&s;el was almo&s;t filled with water, and nothing but immediate death pre&s;ented it&s;elf. In this di&s;tre&s;s the Prie&s;t had recour&s;e to the Bi&s;hop's directions, and took the pot of oil, &s;ome of which he ca&s;t into the &s;ea, and the &s;ea was immediately calmed, the &s;un &s;oon after &s;hone forth, and the &s;hip proceeded with a pro&s;perous voyage. Thus the man of God, through the &s;pirit of pro|phecy, predicted the tempe&s;t, and by the &s;ame holy &s;pirit, though he was him&s;elf ab&s;ent, appea&s;ed the &s;ame.</Q></NOTE> In the month of

He was born in the town of <HI>Duns,</HI> in the county of <HI>Mers,</HI> and being yet a child, after &s;ome ta&s;te he had got of the Latin tongue, by the per&s;wai&s;ion of two Minorite Friars, went to <HI>Oxford,</HI> &s;tudying Logic in <HI>Morton College:</HI> then applying him&s;elf to &s;chola&s;tic Divinity, grew to &s;uch a perfection therein, as he was called the <HI>&s;ubtle Doctor;</HI> and was followed of a number, who after his name are called to this day <HI>Scoti&s;tae.</HI> After he had profe&s;&s;ed a while at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he was called to read divinity in the univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris,</HI> and from thence went to <HI>Colon,</HI> where he died of the apoplexy. They write that after he was laid in grave, his &s;pirits did re|turn, and that &s;triving to get forth, he was there &s;mothered; whereupon an Italian did write this epigram.</P>
<Q><L>Quaecunque humani fuerant juri&s;que &s;acrati</L>

<P>The Engli&s;h writers contend that this <HI>Scotus</HI> was born in <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>Dun&s;tane</HI> village within the pari&s;h of <HI>Emilden,</HI> in the county of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> and confirm it by the manu|&s;cripts re&s;erved in the Library of <HI>Merton Collge,</HI> in one whereof are written the&s;e words, <HI>Explicit actura &s;ubtilis Doctoris in Univer&s;itate Oxonien&s;i (&s;uper libros &s;ententiarum) Doctoris Joannis Duns nati in villa de Emilden vocata Dun&s;tan contracta Duns, in comitatu Northumbriae, pertinens ad Domum &s;chola&s;ticorum de Marton Hall in Oxonio &amp; quondam dictae Domus &s;ocii.</HI> But this is no &s;ufficient proof; for it may be probably &s;uppo&s;ed, that he living at <HI>Oxford,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> when the wars were &s;o hot betwixt the two kingdoms, did di&s;&s;emble his country, and pretend him&s;elf to be an Engli&s;hman born to e&s;chew the hatred of the Students. In <HI>Colen,</HI> where he might without danger &s;hew of what country he was, he did profe&s;s him&s;elf a <HI>Scot,</HI> and the <HI>Minorites</HI> (of which order he was) did therefor upon his tomb, erected in their church, at the end of the quire nigh unto the high altar, &s;et this in&s;cription, which is there yet to be &s;een:
<Q><L>Scotia me genuit, Anglia &s;u&s;cepit</L>
<L>Gallia edocuit, Germania tenet.</L></Q>
What a fine &s;ubtle wit he had, the monuments left by him to po&s;terity do witne&s;s. He died young in the year 1308.</P>

a plain nearly &s;quare, con&s;i&s;ting of about nine acres.

<BIBL>Gib&s;on's Camden.</BIBL></NOTE> The rocks to the north are per|pendicular, of a columniary form, about 30 feet in height, black and horrible; the &s;hore rugged, covered with broken rocks woven over with &s;ea-weed. From the edge of the &s;ea cliffs on the north-we&s;t point, the we&s;tern wall runs along the brink of an elevated rock; a &s;quare tower ari&s;es near the center of this wall, of a con&s;iderable height, and of ex|cellent ma&s;onry, placed on a projecting point of the cliff, &s;o as to af|ford to the armed men within a means of flanking the wall with their mi&s;&s;ile weapons; on each corner there was an exploratory turret. This &s;eems to be the mo&s;t modern part of the ca&s;tle, built of the be&s;t mate|rials, and by the able&s;t workmen. Where the land ri&s;es to the &s;ummit of the rock on the &s;outh-we&s;t point, the wall turns and makes a long &s;traight front to the &s;outh, as repre&s;ented in the plate: the ground be|fore it is level, and appears to have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by art, to form a more commodious parade for the garri&s;on. In this front there is a gate-way, built in a very remarkable &s;tile, being the great entrance to the ca&s;tle: it is formed by a circular arch, with a portico and interior gate; is defended by two heavy &s;emicircular towers uniting with the &s;uper|&s;tructure of the gate-way: the&s;e towers, after ri&s;ing about 20 feet, and containing two tiers of apartments, &s;upport turrets of a &s;quare form, now &s;o very rugged and ruinous, as not to allow a conjecture what was their original height. This wall extends to the cliffs on the &s;ea banks, is guarded by two &s;quare ba&s;tions and a &s;mall &s;ally-port, and is termi|nated by a &s;quare tower with a gate-way. On the brink of the cliff to the &s;ea, on this quarter, appear the remains of a very &s;trong wall; indeed it is probable the whole Area was originally &s;o enclo&s;ed. The heavy &s;eas which break upon the rocks of the north-we&s;t point have torn them much; and it appears as if the area had been originally of greater extent than at pre&s;ent, many &s;eparate columns of rock &s;tanding near the cliffs, which &s;ome ages ago may have been joined to the main land. At the &s;outh point of the area is the well: near to the ea&s;tern tower are the remains of a chapel. Immediately below this tower is a gully or pa&s;&s;age of perpendicular &s;ides, formed in the rocks, about 60 yards in length and 40 feet deep, where the &s;ea makes a dreadful in&s;et, breaking into foam with a tremendous noi&s;e: the &s;pray
<PB N="189" REF="194">
occa&s;ioned thereby is driven within the ca&s;tle walls. This place is called by the country people <HI>the Rumble Churn.</HI> The gulph, from the walls of the tower, which I a&s;cended to obtain the view, has a very awful appearance: you look immediately down upon the aby&s;s, where, as the tide ru&s;hes up, the waters are lifted many feet above the common level, ri&s;ing towards the walls of the tower, as if they would &s;ur|mount the cliffs and deluge the plain. The breaking of the waves in foam over the extreme point of the rocks, the heavy &s;pray, the noi&s;e of the di&s;turbed waters, and the groan which echo returns through the de&s;olated towers, are noble, though tremendous.</P>
<P>The date of this ca&s;tle is fixed by authors to the beginning of the 14th century, <HI>Thomas Earl of Lanca&s;ter,</HI> General of the confederate army which oppo&s;ed King Edward II. being &s;aid to be the founder. He was al&s;o owner of <HI>Pomfret Ca&s;tle,</HI> where, after being taken by the King's troops at <HI>Burrowbridge,</HI> he was impri&s;oned, and &s;oon after de|collated as a traitor; though afterwards he was canonized, and the place of his martyrdom took the name of <HI>St. Thomas's Hill.</HI> He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e e&s;tates, and was the mo&s;t powerful and opulent &s;ubject in Europe, holding at once the Earldoms of <HI>Lanca&s;ter, Lincoln, Salisbury, Leice&s;ter, and Darby.</HI> The King &s;at per&s;onally on his trial, a remarkable circum&s;tance: he died 25th March, 1322, and was buried on the &s;outh &s;ide of the high altar in the priory church there. Such veneration was paid to his tomb, as the enthu&s;ia&s;ts wa&s;ted on that of Becket. The King of his royal clemency remitted the &s;everities of his &s;entence, by which he was condemned to be hanged and quartered, an infamy which &s;eldom had fallen on tho&s;e of royal de&s;cent, he being grand&s;on of King Henry III. But &s;o fluctuating are human affairs, that the ignominious exit of this Earl, gave exalted honours to his name after his death: he was enrolled in the li&s;t of Martyrs, was canonized, and his portrait placed among tho&s;e of &s;acred memory in the cathedral of St. Paul's.</P>

<P>The Nobles of England &s;eing the infinite covetu&s;nes of the Di&s;pen&s;er, came to Thomas of Lanca&s;tre to treate a meane for it. And after of one a&s;&s;ent made a&s;&s;emble at Shirburne yn Elmede. And &s;ending the Kings &s;upplication, and not hard, the Barons went into the Marches of Wales, and de&s;troyid the Di&s;pen&s;ars landes. Then King Edward, at the motion of the Di&s;|pen&s;ars, bani&s;hid John Mountbray, Roger Clifford, Gofeline Dainville, and dyvers others. And after the Barons caulid by brief to a parlament cam with 3 battayles in order, having ten colourid bandes on theyr &s;leves, wherefore it was caullid the parlement de la Bende. And yn this company were Humfre de Boun Counte of Hereforde, Syr Hugh de Andeley, Sir Roger Damare, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Barons hering (the King had taken the ca&s;tle of Leeds) both the Mortymers toke Brige|north, for the which the King bani&s;hed, by proclamation, Thomas of Lanca&s;tre and Humfrede Boun with al theyr adherents.</P>
<P>And after the King cumming agayn his Barons with a &s;tronge ho&s;te, both Mortymer the uncle, and Mortymer the nephew, put them &s;elf yn the Kinges grace, and were &s;ent to the Toure of London.</P>
<P>The Barons hering this cam to Pontfract, to Thomas of Lanca&s;tre, and theire gathering theire poure, a&s;&s;auted the Kinges ca&s;tel of Tikhille, but not wynning it.</P>
<P>And hering of the Kinges ho&s;te, went to Burton apon Trente, keping the Bridge to let the Kinges pa&s;&s;age. But the Kinge pa&s;&s;id per foro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and thens wente the Barons with Thomas Lanca&s;tre to Tuttebyri, and thens to Pontefract. And yn this gorney Syr Roger Dainmore dyed yn the abbay of Tuttebyry.</P>
<P>After this Thomas Lanca&s;tre and the Barons coun&s;elid together in Blake Freres in Pontfracte, and the Baron concludid to go to Dun&s;tanburg, a ca&s;tel of Thomas of Lanca&s;ters in Northum|berland: but he utterly refu&s;id that coun&s;el, le&s;t it might have be thought, that he had, or wolde have intelligence with the Scottes. Wherefore he intendid to remayne at his ca&s;tel at Pontfract.</P>
<P>Syr Roger Clyfford hering this, toke oute his dagger, and &s;ayde, that he wolde kille him his oune handes in that place, except he woold go with them.</P>
<P>Then Thomas Lanca&s;tre a force granted, and went with them, having in company VII. C. menne to borowbridge.</P>
<P>To Borowbridge came Syr Andrew he Harkeley, Warden of Cairluel and that Marches, and Syr Simon Warde, to encountre with the Barons. Where Thomas Lanca&s;tre told Harkeley his ju&s;te quarel agayne the Di&s;pen&s;ers, promi&s;ing hym, if he would favor his cau&s;e, one of the V Countes that then he had in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But Herkeley refu&s;id his offre. Them Thomas prophe|tied that he wold &s;ore repent, and that &s;hortly, &s;o fair, and that he &s;hould dy a &s;hameful deth, that is to &s;ay, to be hangid, drawn and quartered.</P>
<P>Then Harkeley, whom Thomas of Lanca&s;tre had afore tyme made Knight, made his archiers to &s;hote, and &s;o did the Barons upon the bridge. And emong al other, one gotte unde the bridge, and at a hole thru&s;te with a launce the renounid Knight thorough oute al Chri&s;tentye Humfrede de Boun yn the foundemente, &s;o that his bowels cam oute. And Syr Roger Clifforde was &s;ore wonded on the hedde. And Syr William Sulley and Syr Roger Bernefeld were &s;layne. And then wente Thomas Lanca&s;tre into a chapel, denying to rendre hym&s;elf to Harkeley, and &s;aid, looking on the crucifix, <Q>Good Lord, I render my&s;elf to thee, and put me yn to thy mercy.</Q></P>
<P>Then they toke of his cote armures, and put on hym a ray cote, or goune, one of his mennes lyveryes, and caried hym by water to York, were they threw balles of dyrte at hym. And the re&s;idew of the Barons part were pur&s;uid from place to place, and to the church hold was no reverence gyven, and the father pur&s;uid the &s;unne, and the &s;unne the father.</P>
<P>The King hering of this di&s;cumfiture, cam with the Di&s;penfars and other Nobles his adhe|rentes to Ponfracte.</P>
<P>Syr Andrew of Herkeley brought Thomas of Lanca&s;tre to Pontfracte to the Kinge, and there was put in a towre that he had newly made toward the abbay, and after juged in the haule &s;o|denly by thes Ju&s;tices, Syr Hugh Di&s;pen&s;ar the father, Syr Aimer Counte of Pembroke, Syr Edmunde Counte of Kent, Syr John de Britayne, and Syr Robert Malmethorp, that pro|nouncid his judgement.</P>
<P>Then Thomas Lanca&s;tre &s;ayd, Shaul I dy with owt an&s;wer?"</P>
<P>Then certayne Ga&s;coyne toke hym away, and put a pillid broken hatte or hoode on his hedde, and &s;et hym on a lene white jade with owt bridil, and he than cryed thus, <Q>King of Heaven have mercy on me. For the King of Herth nous ad querpi.</Q></P>

garb in which nature doth not look the mo&s;t lovely. <HI>The ca&s;tle</HI> is a noble &s;tructure, rebuilt on the old foundation, and in the Saxon &s;tyle; the architect has &s;trictly pre&s;erved the whole modes and ornaments of the original: the battlements are crowded with effigies, according to the ta&s;te of the Normans, in who&s;e time it underwent a principal repa|ration: the&s;e repre&s;ent men in the act of defence, wielding &s;uch arms as were then u&s;ed; &s;ome of them are di&s;po&s;ed with great propriety, the guard of one of the gate-ways is in the attitude of ca&s;ting down a mighty &s;tone on the heads of a&s;&s;ailants. The building is of a beautiful free-&s;tone, in chi&s;el'd work; its form is &s;ingular, being compo&s;ed of a clu&s;ter of &s;emicircular and angular ba&s;tions. I cannot, without the ichnography of the place, give the reader a more competent idea of its figure, than by comparing it to a &s;ection of the clu&s;tered Saxon pillar in our cathedrals. This edifice &s;tands in a &s;pacious area, which at the time of its greate&s;t &s;trength, I pre&s;ume, totally &s;urrounded it, defended by a compleat circumvallation and a moat; otherwi&s;e the principal part of the fortre&s;s would have lain unguarded by any outwork, except a moat. At pre&s;ent the front is opened to the north-ea&s;t, and the wall having towers at proper intervals, &s;huts it in on the other quarters. As we viewed the ca&s;tle on our approach, the walls with its towers formed a noble flanking to the principal &s;tructure: to the &s;outhward, the gar|den grounds appeared prettily di&s;po&s;ed; to the north and we&s;t, the town of Alnwick was &s;een &s;preading on the back ground. We lamented the want of &s;ome of tho&s;e fine woodlands, and lofty grey rocks, which impend over the Aln, above Alnwick, to give rural and romantic graces to objects &s;o imperial, if I may be permitted to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, in di&s;tingui&s;hing this noble edifice.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed over an elegant &s;tone bridge, on our approach to the town, the battlements formed of interwoven cre&s;cents: we found the Inn crowded with people of fortune, come from all parts of the county, to pay their compliments to the Duke and Duche&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Her Grace was living when the author made his tour and compiled this work.

me comforteth,</Q> appertained to the arms of the Percies, and was placed there when the repairs were made by that family: the moat is drained, and the ceremony of letting down the draw-bridge is forgot; but the walls which enclo&s;e the area &s;till wear the ancient countenance of &s;trength and defiance. You enter by a machicolated gate, defended by an upper tower, and after pa&s;&s;ing a covered way, approach the in|terior gate which admits you to the area: this entrance is defended by all the devices u&s;ed in ancient times; iron &s;tudded gates, portcullis, open galleries, and apertures in the arching for annoying a&s;&s;ailants. The ingenious traveller, Mr Pennant, had been out of humour when he vi|&s;ited this place. We met with all the inconveniences of a noi&s;y and crowded Inn, with every awkward circum&s;tance which could befall tra|vellers, who had undergone no little fatigue in pur&s;uing the paths of plea&s;ure; and yet we could not &s;ubmit to coincide with that gentle|man's &s;entiments: <Q>You look (&s;ays he) in vain, for any marks of the grandeur of the feodal age, for trophies won by a family eminent in our annals for military prowe&s;s and deeds of chivalry; for halls hung with helms and hauberks, or with the &s;poils of the chace; for exten|&s;ive fore&s;ts and venerable oaks. Ye look in vain for the helmet on the tower, the ancient &s;ignal of ho&s;pitality to the traveller, or for the grey-headed Porter, to conduct him to the hall of entertainment. The numerous train who&s;e countenances give welcome to him on his way, are now no more; and in&s;tead of the di&s;intere&s;ted U&s;her of the old times, he is attended by a Valet, eager to receive the fees of admit|tance.</Q> I mu&s;t beg leave to pronounce, that though the &s;avage fero|city of the feodal ages is taken away, yet not the marks of grandeur: we &s;aw no mi&s;erable dungeons filled with captives, no places of execu|tion groaning under their execrable burthen; the towers remain, but without the cry of captivity and torture: Ho&s;pitality cloathed in princely array, &s;its in the hall, di&s;pen&s;ing with a brow of benignity, mixed with features of the highe&s;t magnificence, gifts worthy her hand: the Duke and Duche&s;s are ea&s;y of acce&s;s, and of an affable deportment; their vi|&s;itants are happy under their &s;miles, without being awed by their emi|nence. The attention they pay to the petitions of dependents, is marked with the greate&s;t benevolence; no vain promi&s;es are given to &s;till im|portunity, no hopes are flattered without &s;incerity&mdash;the &s;tricte&s;t honour attends the mo&s;t trivial actions. A truly great principle di&s;tingui&s;hes the&s;e noble per&s;onages; amid&s;t a happy liberality, there is &s;o exact a propriety, and &s;uch perfect oeconomy, that no tran&s;action pa&s;&s;es in the hou&s;ehold, without a certain rule, and &s;ingular regularity. The innu|merable
<PB N="196" REF="202">
charities they pour forth, are be&s;towed with &s;uch admirable propriety, that each per&s;on relieved at the gate, brings a ticket as an authority to the officer for the di&s;pen&s;ation of his Lord's bounty; &s;o that improper objects cannot deceive, or crafty knaves obtain the por|tion a&s;&s;igned for the relief of the truly nece&s;&s;itous and meritorious ob|ject. To enumerate acts of benevolence is incon&s;i&s;tent with my plan, but &s;ome are &s;o &s;ingularly worthy the world's attention, that I cannot re&s;i&s;t the plea&s;ure of relating a &s;ingle tran&s;action, which on my hearing it, brought tears of joy into my eyes.</P>
<P>Her grace returning from an airing in her chariot, pa&s;&s;ed through the ranks of people in the gate-ways, who attended to receive a daily di&s;tribution to the poor. A widow oppre&s;&s;ed with grievous nece&s;&s;ity, could not leave her dome&s;tic employment, or her labour, to attend with her ticket; &s;he entru&s;ted it to her daughter, a girl about &s;even years of age, who took her parent's place at the gate. Her Grace ob&s;erved this girl employed in knitting, whil&s;t all the re&s;t of the indigent group &s;at with idle hands: &s;he &s;ent a &s;ervant to bring the child to her, who received the me&s;&s;age with a&s;toni&s;hment and apprehen&s;ion; &s;he followed the me&s;|&s;enger with trembling &s;teps, revolving in her mind the &s;uppo&s;ed offences &s;he had committed, and looking with eyes &s;wimming in tears on the ill-fated work, &s;he held in her hand, as the cau&s;e of her Grace's di&s;|plea&s;ure. Pale with apprehen&s;ion of reproof, &s;he approached the Du|che&s;s; confu&s;ion and dread were mixed upon her features, whil&s;t looks of timid innocence lived in her eyes. Her grace perceived the child's di&s;tre&s;s, but conceived not the cau&s;e. When the infant had recollected courage enough to give her the power of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;he began a faul|tering and fearful excu&s;e for the &s;uppo&s;ed crime &s;he had committed, in knitting at the gate: a &s;mile of divine benevolence aro&s;e upon the Du|che&s;s's countenance&mdash;&s;implicity and native innocence have great charms &mdash;&s;he was won by the child's &s;en&s;ibility as well as by her indu&s;try. The girl was taken from her indigent mother, cloathed and put to &s;chool, where &s;he is acquiring tho&s;e accompli&s;hments, which one day will ad|vance her above the rank of her humble progenitors.</P>

<P N="16">"XVI. The We&s;t Garret.</P>
<P><Q>The ca&s;tle properly con&s;i&s;ts of three courts or divi&s;ions; the en|trance into which was defended with three &s;trong ma&s;&s;y gates; called the Utter Ward, the Middle Ward, and the Inner Ward. Each of the&s;e gates was in a high embattled tower, furni&s;hed with a port|cullis, and the outward gate with a draw-bridge al&s;o: they had each of them a porter's lodge, and a &s;trong pri&s;on, be&s;ides other nece&s;&s;ary apartments for the con&s;table, bailiff, and &s;ubordinate officers. Under each of the pri&s;ons was a deep and dark dungeon, into which the more refractory pri&s;oners were let down with cords, and from which there was no exit but through the trap door in the floor above. That of the inner ward is &s;till remaining in all its original horrors.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="211"><Q>This ca&s;tle, like many others in the north, was anciently orna|mented with figures of warriors, di&s;tributed round the battlements, and therefore the pre&s;ent noble proprietors have allowed them to be continued, and have &s;upplied &s;ome that had been de&s;troyed, but to &s;hew what they once were; and, that this is no innovation, they have retained the ancient ones, though defaced, which were placed on the top of the two octagon towers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>From length of time, and the &s;hocks it has &s;u&s;tained in ancient wars, this ca&s;tle was become quite a ruin, when by the death of Al|gernon Duke of Somer&s;et, it devolved, together with all the e&s;tates of this great barony, &amp;c. to the pre&s;ent Duke and Duche&s;s of Northum|berland; who immediately &s;et to repair the &s;ame, and with the mo&s;t con&s;ummate ta&s;te and judgment re&s;tored and embelli&s;hed it, as much as po&s;&s;ible, in the true Gothic &s;tyle; &s;o that it may de&s;ervedly be con&s;idered as one of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t magnificent models of a great baronial ca&s;tle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nothing can be more &s;triking than the effect at fir&s;t entrance within the walls from the town, when through a dark gloomy gateway of con&s;iderable length and depth, the eye &s;uddenly emerges into one of the mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;cenes that can be imagined; and is pre&s;ented at once with the great body of the inner ca&s;tle, &s;urrounded with fair &s;emi-circular towers, finely &s;welling to the eye, and gayly adorned with pinnacles, figures, battlements, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The impre&s;&s;ion is &s;till further &s;trengthened by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive en|trance into the &s;econd and third courts, thro' great ma&s;&s;y towers, till the &s;tranger is landed in the inner court, in the very center of this great citadel.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Here he enters to a mo&s;t beautiful &s;tair-ca&s;e, of a very &s;ingular yet plea&s;ing form, expanding like a fan: the cornice of the ceiling is in|riched with a &s;eries of 120 e&s;cutcheons, di&s;playing the principal quar|terings and intermarriages of the Percy family. The &s;pace occupied by this &s;tair-ca&s;e is 46 feet long, 35 feet 4 inches wide, and 43 feet 2 inches high.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The fir&s;t room that pre&s;ents to the left, is the &s;aloon, which is a mo&s;t beautiful apartment, de&s;igned in the gaye&s;t and mo&s;t elegant
<PB N="206" REF="212">
&s;tyle of Gothic architecture; being 42 feet 8 inches long, 37 feet 2 inches wide, and 19 feet 10 inches high.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To this &s;ucceeds the drawing-room, con&s;i&s;ting of one large oval, with a &s;emicircular projection, or bow-window. It is 46 feet 7 inches long, 35 feet 4 inches wide, and 22 feet high.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hence the tran&s;ition is very properly to the great dining room; which was one of the fir&s;t executed, and is of the pure&s;t Gothic, with nitches and other ornaments, that render it a very noble model of a great Baron's hall. In this room was an irregularity in the form, which has been managed with great &s;kill and judgment, and made productive of beauty and convenience. This was a large bow-window, not in the center, but towards the upper end, which now affords a very agreeable rece&s;s when the family dine alone, or for a &s;econd table at the great public dinners. This room is 53 feet 9 inches long, 20 feet 10 inches wide, (exclu&s;ive of the circular rece&s;s, which is 19 feet in diameter) and 26 feet 9 inches high.</Q></P>
<P><Q>From the dining-room, the &s;tranger may either de&s;cend into the court, by a circular Stair-ca&s;e, or he is u&s;hered into a very beautiful Gothic apartment over the gateway, commonly u&s;ed for a breakfa&s;t or &s;upper-room: this is furni&s;hed with clo&s;ets in the octagon towers, and is connected with other private apartments. It is 38 feet 4 inches long, . . feet wide, and 16 feet 1 inch high.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hence the &s;tranger is conducted into the library, which is a very fine room, in the form of a parallelogram, properly fitted up for books, and ornamented with &s;tucco-work in a very rich Gothic &s;tyle; being 64 feet long, . . wide, and 16 feet 1 inch high. This apart|ment leads to</Q></P>
<P><Q>The chapel; which fills all the upper &s;pace of the middle ward. Here the highe&s;t di&s;play of Gothic ornaments in the greate&s;t beauty has been very properly exhibited; and the &s;everal parts of the chapel have been de&s;igned after the mo&s;t perfect models of Gothic excel|lence. The great ea&s;t window is taken from one of the fine&s;t in York min&s;ter. The ceiling is borrowed from that of King's college, in Cam|bridge; and the walls are painted after the great church in Milan: but the windows of painted gla&s;s will be in a &s;tile &s;uperior to any thing that has yet been attempted, and worthy of the pre&s;ent more im|proved
<PB N="207" REF="213">
&s;tate of the arts. Exclu&s;ive of a beautiful circular rece&s;s for the family the chapel is 50 feet long, 21 feet, 4 inches wide, and 22 feet high.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Returning from the chapel through the library, and pa&s;&s;ing by another great &s;tair-ca&s;e, (that fills an oval &s;pace 22 feet 9 inches long, and 15 feet 3 inches wide) we enter a pa&s;&s;age or gallery which leads to two great &s;tate-bed chambers, each 30 feet long, mo&s;t nobly fur|ni&s;hed, with double dre&s;&s;ing rooms, clo&s;ets, and other conveniencies, all in the highe&s;t elegance and magnificence, but as conformable as po&s;&s;ible to the general &s;tile of the ca&s;tle. From the&s;e bed-chambers the pa&s;&s;age opens to the grand &s;tair-ca&s;e, by which we fir&s;t entered, and compleats a tour not ea&s;ily to be paralleled.</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t now turn my attention to the antiquity and hi&s;tory of this place.</P>
<P>Mr Gro&s;e &s;ays, <Q>it is believed to have been founded in the time of the Romans, although no part of the original &s;tructure is now re|maining. But when part of the dungeon or ca&s;tle keep was taken down to be repaired &s;ome years ago, under the pre&s;ent walls were di&s;covered the foundations of other buildings, which lay in a diffe|rent direction from the pre&s;ent; and &s;ome of the &s;tones appeared to have Roman mouldings. "The dungeon or keep of the pre&s;ent ca&s;tle, is believed to have been founded in the Saxon times. The zigzag fret-work round the arch that leads into the inner court, is evidently of Saxon architecture; and yet this was probably not the mo&s;t an|cient entrance; for under the flag tower, before that part was taken down and rebuilt by the pre&s;ent Duke, was the appearance of a gate|way that had been walled up; directly fronting the pre&s;ent outward gateway into the town."</Q></P>

and in the hou&s;e of the Mini&s;ter, they flew above one hundred men, bed&s;ies women and children. <HI>Bernard Baliol,</HI> a youth of great forti|tude, with about 400 hor&s;emen rai&s;ed at Newca&s;tle, engaged in an en|terprize to &s;urprize the Scotch Monarch: they were favoured in their march by a thick fog, which kept them concealed till they reached the environs of Alnwick, when di&s;covering the King attended by about 60 of his chief followers on a reconnoitering party, they came upon them unexpectedly on Saturday the 5th day of July, whil&s;t the principal parts of his va&s;t army were &s;cattered over the country in acts of rapine and violence, and the others laying in an idle and un&s;u&s;picious &s;ecurity before the ca&s;tle, a conflict en&s;ued, in which the King's hor&s;e was killed under him, and many of his attendants were &s;lain, the King being made pri&s;oner. The &s;traggling parties were put to the route or taken, to a great amount in number, before they gained intelligence of the real force of their opponents: and the King of tho&s;e robbers, after being confined &s;ome time in Richmond Ca&s;tle, was removed to London, and afterwards ran&s;omed for 100,000l. at the &s;ame time doing homage for his crown: as a memorial of which &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he depo&s;ited his arms at the altar in York Min&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the reign of King John, A. D. 1212, <HI>Eu&s;tace de Ve&s;ey</HI> being accu&s;ed of a con&s;piracy again&s;t the King's life, fled into Scotland. His ca&s;tle was ordered to be ra&s;ed; but the apprehen&s;ion of a &s;outhern rebellion diverted the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> with the northern Barons, A. D. 1216, at <HI>Felton</HI> did homage to Alexander II. King of Scotland, his brother-in-law, which &s;o much incen&s;ed King John, that he poured forth into the north a large army, laid <HI>Felton</HI> in a&s;hes, together with the towns of <HI>Mitford, Morpeth, Aln|wick, Wark,</HI> and <HI>Roxburgh.</HI> Whil&s;t John made the&s;e dreadful depreda|tions in Northumberland, the Lord <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> with King Alexander, made an incur&s;ion as far as <HI>Barnardca&s;tle,</HI> in the country of Durham, to which they laid &s;iege; and being out on hor&s;eback, to take a view of the for|tre&s;s, in order to plan an a&s;&s;ault, making too near an approach, <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> lo&s;t his life by an arrow &s;hot from &s;ome of the out-po&s;ts.</P>
<P>What greatly contributed to prolong the inte&s;tine troubles of Henry the Third's kingdom in 1266, was the de&s;pair of the rebel Barons, by the forfeitures of their e&s;tates, under the determinations of the parlia|ment of Winche&s;ter. <HI>John de Ve&s;ey</HI> was one of them, and having been
<PB N="214" REF="220">
deprived of his ca&s;tle and barony of Alnwick, he entered into a combi|nation with &s;everal others labouring under the &s;ame pro&s;cription, for the recovery of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. <HI>Ve&s;ey</HI> rai&s;ed a &s;ufficient force to gain his ca&s;tle, but Prince Edward coming again&s;t him with a &s;trong body of forces, reduced his garri&s;on to &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, that he was obliged to &s;urrender, and &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the Prince's mercy; through who&s;e interce&s;&s;ion he received the royal pardon.</P>
<P>In 1264, this <HI>John de Ve&s;ey</HI> was &s;ummoned to parliament in the 28th year of King Henry the Third's reign. This was the glorious aera in which our mode of parliaments was fir&s;t &s;ettled, and Commons regu|larly admitted to a &s;hare in the legi&s;lative power. He died in the 11th year of the reign of King Edward I. And in the 25th year of that reign, A. D. 1297, died <HI>William de Ve&s;ey,</HI> the la&s;t Baron of that family; who having no ligitimate i&s;&s;ue, but leaving a &s;on born out of wedlock, did, by the King's licence, enfeof <HI>Anthony Beck,</HI> Bi&s;hop of Durham and ti|tular Patriarch of Jeru&s;alem, in the ca&s;tle and Barony of Alnwick, in tru&s;t for &s;uch natural &s;on; but this Right Reverend Guardian got the infant deprived of his barony, and as he acquired other royal favours, al&s;o obtained a confirmation from the King of a &s;ale made thereof to Henry Lord Percy, Baron of Topcliff and Spofford, in York&s;hire, an ance&s;tor of the pre&s;ent illu&s;trious family.</P>
<P>Mr Gro&s;e &s;ays, but from what authority he is not plea&s;ed to point out, <Q>that the appointment of the infant's Guardians, as al&s;o the very words of the deed of enfeofment (now extant) in which the convey|ance is to the Bi&s;hop ab&s;olute and unconditional, confute a report too ha&s;tily taken up by &s;ome Hi&s;torians, that this ca&s;tle and barony were only given to the Bi&s;hop in tru&s;t for William the Ba&s;tard above men|tioned; and that he was guilty of a violation of this tru&s;t in di&s;po&s;ing of them otherwi&s;e.</Q> It would have been well if Mr Gro&s;e could have &s;hewn where this deed was to be &s;een; as it would in &s;ome mea&s;ure have exonerated the Bi&s;hop's memory of this infamous charge, and would have &s;et Hi&s;torians right for the future. Rymer (III. 184&mdash;18-9) au|thorizes the contrary determination. I do not remember an in&s;trument of that antiquity, which contains an expre&s;s tru&s;t; but where a tru&s;t was premi&s;ed, it was merely confidential, or expre&s;&s;ed in &s;ome &s;eparate deed. Tru&s;ts were introduced by the Lawmen to evade the &s;tatute of u&s;es made in the reign of King Henry VIII. and from that period gained their legal acceptation.</P>

<P>The la&s;t remarkable incident in hi&s;tory relative to this ca&s;tle, was in the reign of King Edward IV. and happened after his great victory at <HI>Towton.</HI> One <HI>Peter de Brez&egrave;,</HI> a Frenchman, being under his Sovereign's di&s;plea&s;ure, and in pri&s;on, was re&s;tored to liberty on con|dition of his entering into the &s;ervice of the King of Sicily, the father of Margaret of Anjou, and conducting the troops rai&s;ed for her &s;ervice into England. <HI>Brez&egrave;</HI> landed on the Northumberland coa&s;t with about 500

men at arms: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ca&s;tle of Alnwick, which was &s;oon after be&s;ieged by Lord Ha&s;tings, Sir Ralph Gray, and Sir John Howard. The garri&s;on was reduced to great di&s;tre&s;s, when George Douglas, Earl of Angus, influenced to this &s;ervice by great promi&s;es from Margaret, advanced unexpectedly to the be&s;iegers with 10,000 hor&s;emen, and making &s;uch manoeuvres as induced the Engli&s;h army to apprehend he meant to attack them, whil&s;t they were forming them&s;elves in order of battle, he brought a &s;trong party up to the po&s;tern gate, to whom the garri&s;on made a &s;ally, and being mounted on hor&s;es brought for that purpo&s;e, or behind the armed hor&s;emen, the &s;mall garri&s;on evacuated the fortre&s;s, being only 300 in number, and fled without blood&s;hed. It is believed the garri&s;on, before they retired, endeavoured to de&s;troy all the arms and ammunition they could not carry off: for a few years ago, on opening the principal well in the inner ward, which had been long filled up, the workmen found in it a great number of cannon balls of a large &s;ize, &s;uch as were chiefly u&s;ed after the fir&s;t invention of gun|powder.</P>
<P>Margaret, in the month of October following, making another ef|fort, by the treachery of Sir Ralph Gray, the Governor, was again put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Alnwick Ca&s;tle:</HI> but King Edward &s;oon approaching with a numerous army, and finding no forces in the field to oppo&s;e him, Margaret having again retired into Scotland, he laid &s;iege to the three great fortre&s;&s;es of <HI>Alnwick, Dun&s;tanborough,</HI> and <HI>Bambrough,</HI> at the &s;ame time. The troops which inve&s;ted <HI>Alnwick,</HI> being 10,000 in num|ber, were under the command of the Earl of Warwick, the Earl of Kent, the Lord Powis, the Baron of Gray&s;tock, and Lord Cromwell. <HI>Alnwick</HI> held out till the 6th of January; the French General <HI>Brez&eacute;</HI> having made an ineffectual effort to relieve it.</P>

The &s;ame ceremony pa&s;&s;ed between the Earls of Nor|thumberland and Dunbar, on the 22d February then following. But the death of <HI>Hot&s;pur,</HI> and the neglect &s;hewn the Earl of Northumber|land from the Crown, enraged him &s;o much, that in the &s;ucceeding year he openly joined the northern malcontents, and again took up arms again&s;t the King. The royal army &s;oon appeared in the north, &s;eized the Earl's ca&s;tles of <HI>Alnwick</HI> and <HI>Warkworth,</HI> and drove the party to &s;eek refuge in Scotland. A &s;cheme was projected to &s;urrender up this turbulent Earl, but he gaining intelligence of the de&s;ign, e&s;caped, and afterwards levied a &s;ufficient force to enter England, and recover his ca&s;tles: the&s;e pro&s;perous circum&s;tances were &s;oon &s;ucceeded by a total overthrow at the battle of <HI>Bramham Moor,</HI> on the 2d of March, 8th King Henry IV.

<P>As his brother <HI>Thomas</HI> had been attainted, the earldom of Northum|berland for &s;ome time remained dormant: Queen Mary re&s;tored <HI>Thomas</HI> the nephew to the honours and e&s;tates of his ance&s;tors, the patent &s;et|ting forth that the &s;ame was done <Q>in con&s;ideration of his noble de&s;cent, con|&s;tancy of virtues, valour in deeds of arms, and other &s;hining qualifications.</Q> The ceremony of his creation at Whitehall was attended with great pomp: <HI>the proce&s;&s;ion was preceded by</HI> 8 <HI>heralds and</HI> 12 <HI>trumpeters: he was accompanied by the Earls of Pembroke, Arundel, and Rutland, and the Lord Montague, walking in the middle, dre&s;&s;ed in robes of crim&s;on velvet, a hat of crim&s;on velvet, and a coronet of gold.</HI> He was joined with Lord Wharton as Wardens General of the Marches, with very exten&s;ive powers, A. D. 1557. He commanded again&s;t the Scots who made an incur&s;ion the &s;ame year, and giving them battle near <HI>Cheviot,</HI> obtained a compleat victory: Sir John For&s;ter was &s;hot through the mouth, and had his hor&s;e killed under him. Sir Andrew Kerr, the Scotch leader, was taken pri&s;oner. He with his brother <HI>Henry</HI> having entered Scotland in the following year, obtained a victory over the Scotch near <HI>Swinton;</HI> and the &s;ame year engaged the French auxiliaries with equal &s;ucce&s;s, near <HI>Grindon.</HI> In jealou&s;y of Lord Cecil's power with Queen Elizabeth, he entered into the northern con&s;piracy, and at length appeared in open rebellion. It would be incon&s;i&s;tent with my plan, in this place to &s;peak upon that matter; it will &s;uffice to add, that the Earl having fled into Scotland, was betrayed and delivered up, and in the 13th year of Queen Elizabeth, he and his Counte&s;s were convicted of high trea&s;on and out|lawed;

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding your worthy Chairman has &s;o fully expatiated. on the cau&s;e of this chearful and re&s;pectable meeting, I feel my&s;elf animated, not le&s;s from inclination than duty, to offer a few words with your permi&s;&s;ion, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>Public virtues and &s;ingular acts of greatne&s;s, have ever kindled in the mind of man, an ardent de&s;ire of beholding the per&s;ons, or repre|&s;entations of tho&s;e in whom they &s;hone: hence examples of great and generous actions, have been continually handed down to po&s;terity for their imitation, and incitement to glory:&mdash;hence Cae&s;ar&mdash;hence Cato live; and their virtues remain un&s;ullied by the grave, amid&s;t the ru&s;t of time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Rome had its heroes&mdash;Britain boa&s;ts of hers; and when Percy is no more, that picture &s;hall record his deeds.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At a time when the &s;upreme legi&s;lative authority of parliament over the whole Briti&s;h empire was called in que&s;tion; at a time when
<PB N="243" REF="249">
di&s;cord, di&s;obedience, nay rebellion it&s;elf prevailed in America;&mdash;at a time when di&s;&s;ipation and every &s;pecies of luxury pervaded this great nation, and its direful influence was vi&s;ibly increa&s;ing;&mdash;Earl Percy, di&s;daining every con&s;ideration that was unconnected with the com|mon weal, boldly &s;tood forth a champion for his country, a friend to his King, and enemy to tho&s;e who had fallen from their duty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It was not wealth, gentlemen, that could urge him to &s;o dangerous an undertaking&mdash;Fortune had placed him above the pur&s;uit of it:&mdash; it could not be ambition, for rank and titles were already his own; &mdash;but it was public &s;pirit that called him forth;&mdash;for he had <HI>all to lo&s;e,</HI> but <HI>nothing to gain;</HI>&mdash;nothing but the true intere&s;t of his country to acquire. He gave up his own &s;afety, he made a &s;acrifice of every thing;&mdash;plea&s;ures, profit, and intere&s;t&mdash;all were &s;ub&s;ervient to the common good.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Without flattery, gentlemen, I may a&s;&s;ert Rome would have gloried in &s;uch a real Patriot; Rome would have rejoiced to have &s;een one of their Nobility &s;o &s;trenuous in their country's cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But this was not all; and what I have &s;aid would bear but little re&s;emblance to that great man, were I not to take notice of his un|bounded humanity as well as public &s;pirit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>His tenderne&s;s in a time of the greate&s;t calamity; his readine&s;s in &s;haring whatever his ample fortune afforded him with the common &s;oldier, the widow, and the orphan, has rai&s;ed his name almo&s;t above the reach of prai&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Great as his own di&s;tre&s;s was, he overlooked it, in commi&s;erating and relieving that of others: indeed every humane and generous fea|ture of the noble Duke his father, are clearly &s;een in the actions of the &s;on.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But it is not to be wondered at, gentlemen, that humanity, genero|&s;ity, and magnificence, &s;hould &s;hine forth with &s;o much lu&s;tre in the noble Earl, when they are the acknowledged characteri&s;tics of <HI>the Hou&s;e of Northumberland.</HI></Q></P>

to get up &s;ome &s;tone. After having dug about half a yard deep in the ground, he came to 20 &s;word blades, and 16 &s;pear heads lying clo&s;e to the top of the rock, without any ca&s;e or cover than the &s;oil. The &s;words were exactly of the &s;ame &s;hape as tho&s;e in the 51&s;t plate of Mr Gordon's book. N^o 2, 3, and 17 or 18 inches long. Some of the &s;pears re&s;embled 4 and 5 in the &s;ame, but others were broader and cut thro' as in the margin. Dig|ging about a foot lower on the hill &s;ide, he found 42 bra&s;s wedges or chiz|zels, with a ring near their thicker end, of which I doubt not, but you have &s;een many, and &s;o need not give you any de&s;cription of them, but that they are not unlike N^o 4 in Mr Gordon's 50th plate. How and for what they were u&s;ed, I will not take upon me to determine ab&s;olutely, but by their edges which are much broken and battered, they &s;eem to have been employed as chizzels for cutting &s;tone. I believe they put a wooden &s;haft in the hollow end of them, and &s;o drove them with a mallet.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Laurence's Sy&s;tem of Agriculture and Gardening, where he mentions &s;ome of the&s;e found in the &s;mall joints and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vices of the &s;tone in a quatry near Bi&s;hop Weremouth, which is no weak confirmation of my conjecture.</NOTE> If the &s;oft|ne&s;s of the metal and con&s;equently its unfitne&s;s for &s;uch work is objected, I an&s;wer, that when they had not a harder, nece&s;&s;ity would compel them to u&s;e &s;uch as they had; be&s;ides mo&s;t &s;orts of &s;tone are &s;o &s;oft when they lie bedded in, and at their fir&s;t coming out of the quarry, that they might make a very good &s;hift to cut it and cleave it with their tools, while it was under tho&s;e ea&s;y circum&s;tances; to which I may add, that the&s;e bra&s;s chiz|zels are of a much harder temper than we know how to give that metal, as are al&s;o their &s;words which are made of it, and other weapons.</P>
<P>The &s;haft when not employed might be drawn out of the chizzel, and by running a &s;tring thro' the ring on their &s;ides, &s;everal of them might be tied together, and conveniently carried by the workman at his girdle, or otherwi&s;e, and one &s;haft &s;erve them all. About eight years ago near a bu&s;hel of them were found at Cave, upon the banks of the Humber in York&s;hire, under a little Tumulus by the highway &s;ide; and what is very remarkable, every one of them was enclo&s;ed in a matrix of the &s;ame metal, or ca&s;e, fitting it &s;o exactly, that it &s;eemed to be ca&s;t in it, and &s;o fre&s;h and whole were the edges of them, all as if they had never been u&s;ed.</P>
<P>A little above the place where the &s;words and &s;pears were buried at Alnwick, was deeply and rudely cut in the rock 1115, but I cannot think the&s;e figures had any relation to what was &s;ound below. I have had the good fortune to get a &s;word and &s;pear, and 3 chizzels,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Sword, Spear Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and 2 of the Chi&s;&s;els I pre&s;ented to my Lord H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtford.</NOTE> for a crown piece, the re&s;t were &s;eized by the Duke of Somer&s;et's Steward, upon pretence of &s;ecuring them for his Grace, but were never &s;ent to him. So many of the&s;e bra&s;s chizzels have been found in this i&s;land, and &s;o few any where el&s;e, and tho&s;e only in France, that they &s;eem almo&s;t to have been the peculiar tools of the Britons; their near alliance and intercour&s;e with the Gauls ea&s;ily accounting why they have been &s;ometimes di&s;covered in the antient &s;eat of the latter. The &s;words and &s;pear heads afore-mentioned being found &s;o near the&s;e chizzels, and of the very &s;ame metal, is an argument that they belonged to the &s;ame people, which I can|not think to have been Romans, who, as I formerly ventured to give you my opinion, &s;eem to have left off the u&s;e of bra&s;s in their weapons, before their arrival in this i&s;land. The word Ferrum much earlier than that time, denoted in their authors all manner of military weapons, and was a general name for them, which I think is &s;ome additional &s;trength to my former argu|ments on that &s;ubject.</P>

<P>I return you thanks for the account you &s;ent me of the Antiquities found at Alnwick, their number &s;urpri&s;ed me much. Some of the &s;ame kind have been found here in Cairns, nothing in Antiquity is more my&s;terious than the u&s;e of the&s;e In&s;truments of bra&s;s, which re&s;emble &s;mall hatchets or chi&s;&s;els. I incline to think them warlike in&s;truments, as we generally take the &s;tone hatchets to be: I have 3 or 4 of both kinds. When they came fir&s;t into my hands, I &s;et about reading &s;uch accounts as had been given of them, and found that one Mr Hearne had taken a good deal of pains to prove they were Roman. His di&s;&s;ertation is printed in Mott's Collection of the Tran&s;actions of the Royal Society, v. 2. part 4. p. 70. But I cannot be of that gentleman's opinion. The Romans under&s;tood better the expeditious ways of doing things, than to make u&s;e of &s;uch &s;light and brittle tools: We mu&s;t then a&s;cribe them to the ancient Bri|tons who u&s;ed in&s;truments of bra&s;s before iron came to take place: What makes me judge they were not chi&s;&s;els, is, that the Britons made very little u&s;e of hewn <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Stones at Stonehenge are hewen.</NOTE> &s;tone, and for that rea&s;on little or nothing of their &s;tone monuments does remain.

The road by traver&s;ing the hills obliquely, renders the way ea&s;y to the pa&s;&s;enger: it is cloathed on each hand with plantations of various kinds of fore&s;t trees, mingled with great judgment, and &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that the pines and evergreens give an agreeable variegation of colour in the foliage, without deadening the &s;cene. Nothing can be more gloomy than long-extended lines of du&s;ky firs, which, as the Poet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ma&s;on.</NOTE> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <Q>blot the horizon.</Q> The&s;e plantations are bordered on each &s;ide of the road with a variety of flowering &s;hrubs and tufts of flowers.

On the right hand the river forms a &s;emi|circle, the oppo&s;ite &s;hore compo&s;ed of &s;haken and perpendicular rocks, over who&s;e brink impends a fore&s;t of oaks, ri&s;ing &s;hade above &s;hade up to the crown of the mountains. As the <HI>Aln</HI> pa&s;&s;es away from this &s;weet vale, and glides from under the feet of tho&s;e romantic rocks, &s;he doth not even yield a murmur or a &s;igh; except where con&s;trained by &s;ome artificial wears, &s;he turns over with indolence, and falls again to &s;leep on the &s;ucceeding lake.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing this plain, the vale grows narrow, the hills and woods are loftier, and the river here and there frets over a few pebbles which im|pede her pa&s;&s;age.

We a&s;cended to the &s;ummit of the hill, and being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the keys, by which alone we could have had acce&s;s to the&s;e retreats, we flattered our&s;elves no ob&s;tacle could ari&s;e that might deprive us of the &s;ight of the ruins of this religious hou&s;e, and every thing curious there; but the whole is enclo&s;ed with a lofty wall, the interior ground being di&s;po&s;ed in gardening: we found the keeper of this place a little man, of a mean and in&s;olent a&s;pect; he heard our reque&s;t with the door in his hand, after which, with a contemptuous &s;ilence, he walked in and turned the key again&s;t us, as if he was afraid we &s;hould di&s;cover &s;ome theft he was committing again&s;t his Lord. Thus excluded and looking ridiculous enough, we could do nothing more than ride round the walls, by which we ob|&s;erved that the ruins chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;mall chapel, wanting little be&s;ides a roof: the tower a &s;quare building, with exploratory turrets at each corner, is in good repair, fitted up as a plea&s;ure room, command|ing a beautiful pro&s;pect, as we could &s;ufficiently judge from our lower &s;ituation.</P>

<P><PB N="250" REF="256">I will pur&s;ue the account given by Mr Gro&s;e of this <HI>Abbey,</HI> as the mo&s;t perfect one extant. <Q><HI>Hulne</HI> was the fir&s;t mona&s;tery of Carmelite Friars in this kingdom. The account of its foundation is thus given by ancient writers: Among the Briti&s;h Barons who went to the Holy Wars in the reign of King Henry III. were William de Ve&s;ey Lord of Alnwick, and Richard Gray, two eminent chieftains in the chri&s;tian army: led by curio&s;ity or devotion, they went to vi&s;it the Monks of Mount Carmel, and there unexpectedly found a country|man of their own, one Ralph Fre&s;born, a Northumberland-man, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in a former cru&s;ade; and in con&s;e|quence of a vow had afterwards taken upon him the mona&s;tic pro|fe&s;&s;ion in that &s;olitude. When Ve&s;ey and Gray returned to England, they &s;trongly importuned the &s;uperior of the Carmelites to let their countryman accompany them home; which was at length granted, upon condition that they would found a mona&s;tery for Carmelites in their own country. Soon after their return, Fre&s;born, mindful of their engagement, began to look out for a place for their Convent. After examining all the circumjacent &s;olitudes, he at length fixed upon the pre&s;ent &s;pot, induced, it is &s;aid, by the great re&s;emblance which the adjoining hill bore to Mount Carmel: and indeed whoever looks into Maundril's travels, will find that the draught of that mountain, given in his book, bears a &s;trong likene&s;s to this be|fore us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The above William de Ve&s;ey gave a grant of the ground, con|&s;i&s;ting of twelve or thirteen acres, in his park of Holne; but Fre&s;|born is &s;aid to have erected the building him&s;elf. The foundation was laid about A. D. 1240, and Fre&s;born gathering a proper number of Monks, became the fir&s;t Abbot of the Order; and having pre|&s;ided here with great reputation of &s;anctity, at length died, and was buried in the mona&s;tery about the year 1274.</Q></P>
<P>The original grant of William de Ve&s;ey, was confirmed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors Ve&s;eys; and by the Percies, after their becoming proprietors of Alnwick: many additional privileges and immunities were added by the &s;ucceeding grants, particulari&s;ed in Mr Gro&s;e's work, but too

<FIGDESC>depiction of Alnwick Abbey gateway</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>There are no remains of the <HI>Abbey,</HI> but a <HI>Gateway and Tower,</HI> which by the architecture and arms &s;culptured upon the building, &s;hew it is of much more modern date than the foundation of the hou&s;e. This tower is not &s;quare, but oblong, having an exploratory turret on each corner. The north &s;ide is ornamented with a nich, canopy'd, capable of receiving a &s;tatue five feet high: mo&s;t probable it contained the effi|gies of the dedicatory Virgin. Beneath is a figure of an angel in relief, with expanded wings. Over this entrance are &s;hields of arms, a cro&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the arms of the Ve&s;eys, and a cro&s;s molin. On the &s;outh &s;ide, in a nich, is the figure of one of the Religious, of the order of White Friars of Premon&s;traten&s;es, in his proper habilament, in pretty good pre&s;ervation. This front is ornamented with &s;hields of arms, the arms of Brabant adopted by the Percys, with the arms of Lucys quar|terly, the principal; and al&s;o the arms of Ve&s;ey.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="262">A gate opens to the ea&s;t, on each &s;ide of which are the figures of cherubs &s;upporting armorial &s;hields: on this front is al&s;o a canopy and nich for a &s;tatue. Here are the arms of Brabant and the arms of Lucys on &s;eparate &s;hields. At this entrance, as al&s;o on the north &s;ide, were machicolations; and in the center of the arching of the gateway is a &s;quare aperture, from whence the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors could annoy a&s;&s;ailants. The ma&s;onry of this tower is excellent; the gates of lattice braced with iron &s;till remain.</P>
<P>Above the gate going into the court of the hou&s;e, is an e&s;cutcheon of white marble, much injured by the weather, but retaining &s;ome marks of the Sculptor, to di&s;tingui&s;h that it once contained the cre&s;t of the Doubledays, an arm in armour &s;u&s;pending a mullet. The antiquity of this piece has been much doubted, but the materials determine that point clearly.</P>
<P>This &s;eat of <HI>the Doubleday family</HI> has nothing very &s;ingular to mark it, but the beauty of the retirement, under the hanging woods of the river Aln. The ground plot of the religious hou&s;e is now included in the orchard; the ruins of which probably afforded materials for the pre|&s;ent man&s;ion; but there are not the lea&s;t remains to denote the exact &s;cite of the mona&s;tic buildings, or the place of interment of the illu&s;tri|ous per&s;onages before mentioned.</P>
<P>Solemn &s;ituations like this, and the ruins of religious hou&s;es, always affect my mind with a degree of langui&s;hment. Such a &s;eclu&s;ion, &s;uch a retirement, would have filled my wi&s;h. The life of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tic is mo&s;t de&s;irable, and &s;eems calculated to be the happie&s;t. No natural tendency to indolence and ea&s;e prompts this determination; but the &s;e|renity of a Churchman's life, under the entire preclu&s;ion of all worldly concerns, affords that tranquillity of mind, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to contemplation and &s;tudy, to philo&s;ophic re&s;earches, and divine meditation&mdash;without the poi&s;on of ambition, &s;ome minds can enjoy a mediocrity with con|tent&mdash;without an impertinent wi&s;h to intermeddle with public affairs, &s;ome men can &s;it within the little man&s;ion, bu&s;ied only in pious duties and contemplations; and amid&s;t dome&s;tic peace, living each day, in gratitude for the enjoyment of the rural beauties of &s;ome &s;ylvan &s;cene, the plain, the mead, the grotto, and the &s;tream&mdash;call it luxury: but the bu&s;y world ince&s;&s;antly rolls the heavy wheels of care too near my thre&s;hold&mdash;I am frequently induced to adopt Horace's de&s;cription:

<P><PB N="258" REF="265">An account of this place, publi&s;hed in the Newca&s;tle Courant in the year 1772, contains the following particulars: <Q>It is about three quar|ters of a mile from the &s;ea. The principal &s;treet &s;tands upon a ri&s;ing ground, at the higher end of which, upon an eminence, are the re|mains of an ancient ca&s;tle. The market place is in the middle of the town, where is a fine &s;tone cro&s;s on a &s;pacious area at the meeting of two &s;treets, the one leading to the church, which is an elegant &s;truc|ture, who&s;e &s;pire is upwards 100 feet high; the other to the bridge, where is an ancient tower. Contiguous to the bridge is a large free|&s;tone quarry, the &s;tones of which are &s;o much e&s;teemed, that great quantities thereof are &s;hipped for London. The &s;almon fi&s;hery here is carried to a very great extent, &s;o that at the mouth of the Coquet, in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, as well as in the river it&s;elf, are &s;ome thou&s;ands caught, which gives employment to a number of hands. The river, which almo&s;t &s;urrounds the town, directs its cour&s;e in a &s;traight line for about half a mile, then leaving the fine and plea&s;ant villas of Glo&s;terhill and Amble on its &s;outhern banks, while it lo&s;es it&s;elf in the ocean. In the year 1764, it left its old cour&s;e, and forced its way between two &s;andy hills overgrown with bent, that had ob|&s;tructed its pa&s;&s;age for ages, and is now &s;ettled in a very deep channel, with a fine clay bottom, which makes it navigable for &s;mall craft. It is &s;aid there is upwards of 14 feet of water upon the bar at full &s;ea, and continues that depth very near the town; &s;o that with a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, it might be made to admit &s;hips of a con&s;i|derable burthen; and as Coquet I&s;land is &s;ituated a little to the &s;outh|ward, forms a fine bay at the very mouth of the river. The grounds adjoining thereto abound with a fine &s;eam of coal; and &s;o plentiful is corn, that few counties can equal its fertility. From the&s;e con&s;i|derations, what pity it is that Warkworth was not made a &s;ea-port, &s;ince nature has almo&s;t half fini&s;hed the de&s;ign.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This little borough is governed by a Mayor, who is cho&s;en annually at a Court Leet, and enjoys great privileges by an exten&s;ive common, the property of the village, and &s;ome little indulgencies from his Grace the Duke of Northumberland; and as the town con&s;i&s;ts all of free burge&s;&s;es, is capable of great improvements.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>John Fitz Robert, in 7 King Henry III. obtained licence that the market which had been u&s;ually kept upon the <HI>Sunday</HI> at his manor of Werkworth, &s;hould be held upon the Wedne&s;day every week.</P>

<P><PB N="259" REF="266">The ca&s;tle &s;tands on the crown of a rock, of an oblong figure; the great tower to the north, placed on the brink of the cliff above the town, is of fine architecture in chi&s;el-work, of a &s;ingular figure, being octangular, and from the center of four oppo&s;ite &s;ides, a turret projects, of a &s;emi-hexagonal form; from the middle of the building a very lofty exploratory turret ari&s;es. This part of the ca&s;tle owes its origin to the <HI>Percys,</HI> as appears by the <HI>Lion of Brabant</HI> above the gate, and the arms di&s;per&s;ed over the building. The we&s;tern &s;ide is formed of various irregular towers and walling of different ages, extending along the brink of the cliff, who&s;e foot is wa&s;hed by the river <HI>Coquet.</HI> On the &s;outh, the ground ri&s;es gradually to the height of the rocks on which the we&s;tern buildings are founded. This &s;ide of the ca&s;tle fronts to a &s;pacious plain or platform, and is defended by a high wall with an outward moat. The ancient gateway and chief entrance to the ca&s;tle is on this &s;ide; the gate defended by circular towers and a draw bridge. The ea&s;tern &s;ide is placed on the brink of a &s;teep declivity, defended by an outward moat, and a lofty wall guarded by a &s;quare ba&s;tion near the center, and an angular tower at the &s;outh point. The walls enclo&s;e a &s;pacious area, almo&s;t &s;quare, within which the ancient parts of the fortre&s;s are very ruinous.</P>
<P>The view from hence is &s;o exten&s;ive and various, that de&s;cription can carry but a very imperfect idea of its members or its beauties: to the ea&s;t and north-ea&s;t, there is a &s;ea pro&s;pect, with which you take in all the &s;hore we had traver&s;ed, with <HI>Dun&s;tanbrough</HI> and <HI>Bambrough Ca&s;tles</HI> at the mo&s;t di&s;tant point of land: the <HI>Farn I&s;lands</HI> lie &s;cattered like patches on the face of the waters. The port of <HI>Alemouth</HI> is a nearer object, and at a little di&s;tance the mouth of the river <HI>Coquet</HI> and <HI>Coquet I&s;land</HI> with its ruined mona&s;tery are &s;een. To the north, you view a rich cultivated country to <HI>Alnwick;</HI> we&s;tward, the banks of <HI>Coquet</HI> river, graced with little woodlands, which here and there impend on its winding channel; to the &s;outh, you view an exten&s;ive plain, in|clining towards the &s;ea, crowded with villages, and inter&s;per&s;ed with woods; the &s;hore indented by many little ports and creeks; the higher grounds are &s;cattered over with innumerable hamlets, churches, and other buildings, mingling with a variety highly plea&s;ing; whil&s;t on the extreme di&s;tance, the different teints of the land&s;kip, ari&s;ing from va|rious objects, require colours to convey their picture to the mind.</P>

<PB N="260" REF="267">
what part &s;oever it is viewed; and though when entire it was far from being de&s;titute of &s;trength, yet its appearance does not excite the idea of one of tho&s;e rugged fortre&s;&s;es de&s;tined &s;olely for war, who&s;e gloomy towers &s;ugge&s;t to the imagination only dungeons, chains, and executions: but rather that of &s;uch an ancient ho&s;pitable man&s;ion as is alluded to by Milton,</Q>

<P><Q>The ca&s;tle and mote, according to an ancient &s;urvey, contained 5 acres 17&frac34; perches of ground. Its walls on the &s;outh, ea&s;t, and we&s;t &s;ides are garni&s;hed with towers. The great gate of the ca&s;tle is on the &s;outh &s;ide, between two polygonal towers, and is al&s;o defended with ma|chicolations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The keep or dungeon forms the north front; its figure is a &s;quare with the angles canted off. Near the middle of each face of this &s;quare there is a turret, projecting at right angles, its end terminating in a &s;emi-hexagon: the&s;e projections are of the &s;ame height as the re&s;t of the keep. This keep is very large and lofty, and contains a variety of magnificent apartments.</Q></P>

lofty perpendicular rocks on the other hand confining the walk to about the width of four feet. From the &s;ummit of the cliffs a grove

of oaks is &s;u&s;pended, giving a &s;olemn &s;hade; and at their feet i&s;&s;ues a &s;pring of the pure&s;t water, which formerly &s;upplied the Reclu&s;e. The &s;teps, ve&s;tibule, and chief apartments of the Hermitage, are hewn out of the bo&s;om of a free-&s;tone rock, who&s;e out&s;ide face is about 20 feet high, embowered with &s;tately trees, which impend from the top of the preci|pice and fi&s;&s;ures of the cliffs. One lower and outward apartment is of ma&s;onry. We entered into this lower apartment by a pa&s;&s;age of three paces, the doorway marked with the remains of bolts and iron hinges: it is built up again&s;t the &s;ide of the rock, about 18 feet &s;quare, and ap|pears to have been the kitchen or principal dwelling, having a range or fire-place &s;ix feet wide. On the &s;outh &s;ide of this apartment, oppo&s;ite to our entrance, is a doorway leading to an outward &s;eat formed in the rock, and opening upon the walk on the river's brink. On this &s;ide
<PB N="264" REF="271">
of the room are two windows, which bear the marks of iron-grating, and al&s;o a clo&s;et. By holes cut in the rock, it &s;eems as if timbers had been lodged therein for the flooring of an upper chamber. This &s;truc|ture is built of a&s;hler-work, and appeared to us of much more modern date than the cells formed in the rock. Pa&s;&s;ing from this outward build|ing the way we entered, we a&s;cended by 17 &s;teps to a little ve&s;tibule, with a &s;eat on each &s;ide capable of holding one per&s;on only. Above the inner doorway &s;ome letters appear, the remains of a phra&s;e which may be thus rendered in Engli&s;h: <HI>"My tears have been my food day and night."</HI> From thence we entered the principal apartment or <HI>chapel,</HI> about 18 feet in length, and not more than &s;even feet and an half wide, and of the &s;ame height. Two pila&s;ters of &s;emi-hexagonal form project from the oppo&s;ite walls in the center, and one from each corner, from whence &s;pring the inter&s;ecting groins of the roof, the joinings ornamented with ro&s;es. The pila&s;ters have plain capitals and ba&s;es, in the old Gothic &s;tile. All the work is chi&s;elled, and done with mechanic ex|actne&s;s and regularity: the wall or out&s;ide rock as you enter is left &s;o thick, as to admit the ve&s;tibule before de&s;cribed. At the ea&s;t end is an altar, formed cro&s;s the whole apartment, a&s;cended by two &s;teps; the upper plane edged with a moulding. In the center of the wall behind is a nich for a crucifix or image, with the remains of a glory. On the

right hand as you approach the altar, cut out of the thickne&s;s of the wall, is a nich or cavity, like tho&s;e often de&s;cribed in the progre&s;s of this work, left in the walls of the ailes of churches; within which there is repre&s;ented a table monument (no chink or cavity appearing, to give a &s;uppo&s;ition that it is hollowed to receive any human remains) with a recumbent female figure,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Wallis's de&s;cription is in the following words. <Q>In the fole of a window, at the &s;outh end of the altar, is the effigies of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, &s;culptured in &s;tone, recumbent; another of the child Je&s;us on her right hand, &s;tanding, his left re&s;ted upon her &s;houlder; at her feet, in a nich in the wall, is the effigies of an Hermit, in the attitude of prayer.</Q> Mr Wallis is in an error here, for the female recumbent figure, having its head towards the ea&s;t, lays with the right hand to the chapel: if any figure has &s;tood on the &s;ide of the effigies, it mu&s;t have been again&s;t the pillar which divides the windows.

<PB N="266" REF="273">
for holy water, and the feet of the effigies re&s;t again&s;t an animal (mo&s;t likely a dog, as an emblem of fidelity) as is u&s;ual on monuments of the like form. I pay great deference to the opinions of other vi&s;itants, but cannot agree with the author of the poem, that this is a bull's head, or the u&s;ual place for cre&s;ts: on the contrary, according to the virtues of the decea&s;ed, ancient tombs are decorated with an animal at the foot of the effigies, as a lion for fortitude, a dog for fidelity, &amp;c. and this &s;ame figure appeared to me no other than that of a crouching dog; as is to be &s;een on multitudes of ancient tombs. The u&s;ual place of the cre&s;t on tombs, is under the head of the effigies. The examples in the northern counties are mo&s;t likely to point out to us the prevailing fa&s;hion. The bull's head is in that po&s;ition on the tombs of the family of Nevils, in Brancepeth and Staindrop churches, in the county of Dur|ham; and a dog lays at the feet. The &s;ame on the fine tomb of Ogle, in Bothal church, and al&s;o the Ram's head on the elegant tomb of Gray, at Chillingham, with many other in&s;tances in Northumberland. Under the head of the effigies no cre&s;t appears; a double cu&s;hion is the &s;upport. By length of time, and the weather beating through the windows, the figures are greatly injured. In a nich at the foot of the monument, and cut in the wall, is the figure of an Hermit on his knees, re&s;ting his head on his right hand, and his left hand placed on his bo&s;om, as in a lamenting or pen&s;ive po&s;ture. The author of the poem has racked invention to conceive a cau&s;e for our Hermit's vow of &s;everity and retirement.</P>

<L>Young Lord, thy grand&s;ire had a friend,</L>
<L>In days of youthful fame;</L>
<L>Yon di&s;tant hills were his domains;</L>
<L>Sir Bertram <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>From the adverti&s;ement to the Poem.</P>
<P>About a mile from the ca&s;tle, in a deep romantic valley, are the remains of a hermitage; of which the chapel is &s;till entire. This is hollowed with great elegance, in a cliff near the river; as are al&s;o two adjoining apartments, which probably &s;erved for the &s;acri&s;ty and ve&s;try, or were appropriated to &s;ome other &s;acred u&s;es: for the former of the&s;e, which runs parallel with the chapel, appears to have had an alter in it, at which ma&s;s was occa&s;ionly celebrated, as well as in the chapel it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e apartments is extremely &s;mall; for that which was the principal chapel does not in length exceed 18 feet, nor is more than 7&frac12; feet in breadth and height: it is, however, very beautifully de&s;igned and executed, in the &s;olid rock; and has all the decorations of a com|pleat Gothic church or cathedral in miniature.</P>
<P>But what principally di&s;tingui&s;hes the chapel, is a &s;mall tomb or monument on the &s;outh &s;ide of the altar; on the top of which lies a female figure, extended in the manner that effigies are u&s;ually exhibited praying on ancient tombs. This figure, which is very delicately de&s;igned, &s;ome have ignorantly called an image of the Virgin Mary, though it has not the lea&s;t re&s;em|blance to the manner in which &s;he is repre&s;ented in the Romi&s;h churches; who is u&s;ually erect, as the object of adoration, and never in a pro&s;trate or recumbent po&s;ture. Indeed the real image of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin probably &s;tood in a &s;mall nich, &s;till vi&s;ible behind the altar: whereas the figure of a bull's head, which is rudely carved at this lady's feet, the u&s;ual place for the cre&s;t in old monuments, plainly proves her to have been a very different per&s;onage.</P>
<P>About the tomb are &s;everal other figures, which, as well as the principal one above men|tioned, are cut in the natural rock, in the &s;ame manner as the little chapel it&s;elf, with all its ornaments, and the two adjoining apartments. What &s;light traditions are &s;cattered through the country, concerning the origin and foundation of this hermitage, tomb, &amp;c. are delivered to the reader in the following rhimes.</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally agreed, that the founder was one of the Bertram family, which had once con&s;iderable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Northumberland, and were anciently Lords of Bothal ca&s;tle, &s;ituate about ten miles from Warkworth. He has been thought to be the &s;ame Bertram that endowed Brinkburn Priory, and built Brenk&s;haw chapel; which both &s;tand in the &s;ame winding valley, higher up the river.</P>
<P>But Brinkburn Priory was founded in the reign of King Henry I. whereas the form of the Gothick windows in this chapel, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e near the altar, is found rather to re&s;emble the &s;tile of architecture that prevailed about the reign of King Edward III. and indeed that the &s;culpture in this chapel cannot be much older, appears from the cre&s;t which is placed at the lady's feet on the tomb; for Camden informs us, that armorial cre&s;ts did not become here|ditary till about the reign of King Edward II.</P></NOTE> was his name.</L>

<P>In Mr Gro&s;e's account of this Hermitage, it is alledged, that it was univer&s;ally believed the fir&s;t Hermit enjoined him&s;elf this life of pennance and &s;everity, in contrition for the murder of his own brother. I mu&s;t &s;ay, I was &s;truck with an idea on my fir&s;t entrance, which grew upon me whil&s;t I remained in the&s;e &s;acred vaults, and drew on a train of pen&s;ive thoughts: There needed nothing barbarous, &s;avage, or mur|derous to induce a man to &s;uch a life&mdash;di&s;appointed love was &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to incite it: Conceive the per&s;onage &s;culptured upon the tomb or monument, to be the devoted bride or beloved wife of the Reclu&s;e, cut off in the prime of life by &s;ome common ca&s;ualty, perhaps after a &s;hort life of harmony and love in the marriage &s;tate, in the in&s;tant of bringing into the world the i&s;&s;ue of an happy intercour&s;e, and the heir of an opulent race&mdash;this was cau&s;e &s;ufficient. Under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, we &s;hould entertain more feelings for the tender &s;orrows and di&s;appointed love of the Hermit, than we can experience when we &s;ee him &s;tained with bloody crimes, ari&s;ing from wrath, revenge, ra&s;hne&s;s, or indi&s;cretion&mdash;mad with jealou&s;y, even to &s;uch a blindne&s;s, that he could not know his own brother, though gone forth in di&s;gui&s;e at his in&s;tance on the &s;ame errand with him&s;elf. I own my ideas furni&s;hed me with a very different picture of the Hermit's woes&mdash;I &s;tood over the monument with an eye flooded in tears, and a mind di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the tendere&s;t touches of commi&s;eration. After mu&s;ing for &s;ome time, I imagined I could hear the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed inhabitant exclaim: <Q>In the du&s;t re&s;ts for ever the beloved remains of the be&s;t of women&mdash;united to me by love and wedloc&mdash;the hopes of my youth, the joy of my de|&s;ire, and the felicity of my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; with her I had flattered my mind, life would pa&s;s away &s;erenely, and the evening of the human day advance in peace: but alas! when my happine&s;s was at its height, &s;he was &s;natched from me, and forlornne&s;s be&s;et my &s;teps.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="282">But to return to my de&s;cription: The we&s;t end of the chapel is lighted by a window formed of four conjoining circles: above the inner door of the ve&s;tibule is a &s;hield, bearing the remains of &s;ome arms; by &s;ome taken to be the figure of a gauntlet; but as it is generally believed one of the Bertrams formed this hermitage, &s;o it is probable this &s;hield (the remains of which &s;eem to corre&s;pond therewith) bore the Bertrams' arms, Or, an orl, azure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Bertrams were an ancient family in this country: they held great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions under the &s;avour of William the Conqueror, with whom Sir Richard Bertram; a Norman Knight, came over to England. He had in marriage, as a royal ward, Sibel, the daughter and heire&s;s of the Mitford family. Sir William his &s;on obtained his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Mitford to be created a Barony by King Henry I. He married Alice the daughter of Sir William Merley, by whom he had i&s;&s;ue two &s;ons. This Sir William was, or O&s;bertus Colutarius, under his grant, the foun|der of Brinkburn Priony, afterwards de&s;cribed.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the left hand of the altar, a window is formed in the partition of the apartments, divided by two mullions, the &s;ummit of each light or divi&s;ion ornamented with work formed of &s;ections of circles, like tho&s;e &s;een in cathedrals of the tenth century. From the chapel we en|tered an inner apartment, by a neat door-ca&s;e, over which is &s;culptured a &s;hield, with the crucifixion and &s;everal in&s;truments of torture. At the ea&s;t end of this inner apartment, is an altar like that in the chapel, lighted by the la&s;t-de&s;cribed window, and through which the per&s;on kneeling at the inner altar, could view the cenotaph in the chapel: this apartment is about five feet wide and nine paces in length: here is al&s;o a nich or ba&s;on for holy water. On the northern &s;ide of this inner chamber, a rece&s;s is cut in the rock, of &s;ize &s;ufficient to hold the couch of a per&s;on of middling &s;tature. I have &s;een &s;everal of the like form, alcoved above, and a &s;ole about two feet above the level of the floor to hold the matra&s;s and bedding of the Reclu&s;e. This rece&s;s is &s;o placed, that whil&s;t I &s;at therein to make my notes, by a nich cut &s;lantwi&s;e in the partition wall which &s;eparates the two apartments, I had a view of the cenotaph and effigies thereon. The nich &s;eemed calculated for this very purpo&s;e; being cut through the wall a&s;&s;ant, it could not be conceived intended to convey the light. By &s;ome it has been imagined to be de|&s;igned for confe&s;&s;ion, but it is my &s;entiment that the Hermit was prie&s;t and penitent in one; and that he had devi&s;ed tho&s;e apertures, that the effigies &s;hould be con&s;tantly in his &s;ight. In this inner apartment, is a &s;mall clo&s;et cut in the &s;ide wall to the north: from this interior cham|ber is a doorway leading to an open gallery, having a pro&s;pect up the
<PB N="276" REF="283">
river; but by the falling of &s;ome of the rock above, this part is greatly damaged. It is &s;aid by old people, that the roof was &s;upported by a fine pillar, and formed a &s;mall piazza cloi&s;ter or open gallery&mdash;&s;uch galleries are &s;een in very ancient man&s;ions, in the centre of the front: one is yet perfect in the remains of Bradley Hall, in the county of Dur|ham, the man&s;ion of the elde&s;t branch of the family of Bowes, built, as it is pre&s;umed, &s;oon after the conque&s;t.</P>
<P>From the&s;e cells, through a neat doorway, there are winding &s;tairs cut in the rock, leading to its &s;ummit, &s;uppo&s;ed to conduct to the Hermit's olatory or garden. A channel is ingeniou&s;ly formed on the &s;teps to carry off the water.</P>
<P>It &s;eems evident that the original hermitage con&s;i&s;ted of no more than the apartments hewn in the rock, the inner one being the dwelling-place, and the little cloi&s;ter the &s;ummer &s;eat, facing we&s;tward, and commanding a beautiful view up the river Coquet, which here forms a fine curve, in extent near half a mile, on this &s;ide bordered by rocks, on the other by cultivated lands, of an ea&s;y inclination; on the extremity &s;tands a pretty farmhold, to terminate the &s;eque&s;tered rural pro&s;pect. The &s;tyle of architecture adopted in this hermitage is of the Saxon Go|thic, which proves its antiquity. In the po&s;t&s;cript to the <HI>poem</HI> of the Hermit of Warkworth, the author a&s;&s;erts, <Q>that the memory of the fir&s;t Hermit was held in &s;uch regard and veneration by the <HI>Percy</HI> fa|mily, that they afterwards maintained a chantry prie&s;t, to re&s;ide in the hermitage and celebrate ma&s;s in the chapel; who&s;e allowance, uncommonly liberal and munificent, was continued down to the di&s;|&s;olution of the mona&s;teries; and then the whole &s;alary, together with the hermitage and all its dependencies, reverted back to the family; having never been endowed in mortmain. On this account we have no record which fixes the date of the foundation, or gives any parti|cular account of the fir&s;t Hermit.</Q> The patent is extant, which was granted to the la&s;t Hermit in 1532, by the &s;ixth Earl of Northumber|land.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Henry Earl of Northumberland, &amp;c.

of the above patent, it will perhaps be needle&s;s to caution the reader again&s;t a mi&s;take &s;ome have fallen into, of confounding the hermitage near Warkworth, with a chantry founded within the town it&s;elf, by Nicholas de Farnham, Bi&s;hop of Durham, in the reign of King Henry III. who appropriated the church of Branxton for the maintenance there of two Benedictine Monks from Durham. That &s;mall mona&s;tic foundation is indeed called a cell by Bi&s;hop Tanner; but he mu&s;t be very ignorant, who &s;uppo&s;es that by the word cell, is nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood a hermitage; whereas it was commonly applied to any &s;mall conventual e&s;tabli&s;hment, which was dependant on another. As to the chapel belonging to this endowment of Bi&s;hop Farnham, it is mentioned as in ruins in &s;everal old &s;urveys of Queen Elizabeth's time; and its &s;cite not far from Warkworth church, is &s;till remembered.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A Cell of two Benedictine Monks from Durham, for who&s;e maintenance here Nicholas de Farnham, Bi&s;hop of Durham, who died A.

The walls are almo&s;t entire; the great tower is very perfect: there are &s;ome remains of the dormitory, now converted into a cellar. Mr Gro&s;e ob&s;erves, that <Q>the&s;e ruins exhibit one among the many in|&s;tances wherein circular and pointed arches occur in the &s;ame build|ing, and that in parts manife&s;tly con&s;tructed at the &s;ame time; which &s;hews, that about the period of its erection, there was a kind of &s;truggle between the ancient mode or Saxon, and what is called Go|thic architecture; in which neither &s;tyle then thoroughly prevailed. The upper range of windows in this church are all circular; tho&s;e immediately under them are pointed. Two doors, one on the north, the other on the &s;outh, have circular arches, (of various members, falling back, &s;upported on pila&s;ters) richly adorned with variety of Saxon ornaments, particularly that on the north, which has among others the heads of animals. The&s;e are generally deemed the mo&s;t ancient decorations of that &s;tyle. The great tower has four pointed arches, and others of the &s;ame &s;hape are &s;upported by ma&s;&s;y octa|gonal pillars in the body of the church. There have been burials here as late as the year 1745. At the ea&s;t end, and in the north and &s;outh cro&s;&s;es, were chapels; in one of which are divers fragments of coffins and human bones. On the whole, though this building, ex|cept about the doors, is remarkably plain, it has a &s;ober and &s;olemn maje&s;ty, not always found in buildings more highly decorated. Part of this, perhaps, it may owe to its romantic &s;ituation, which is the mo&s;t proper in the world for retirement and meditation. Near the &s;outh|we&s;t

<P>The Chantry founded at Morpeth, was &s;ituated on the north ea&s;t of the bridge, as you enter the town, very near the &s;ide of the river Wan&s;beck, in a beautiful vale of wood and water, as mo&s;t of the religious hou&s;es in the north are. It was partly pulled down at the di&s;|&s;olution of the Mona&s;teries, and remained in that &s;ituation till the 6th year of King Edward VI. when a Grammar School was founded here, and endowed with the whole e&s;tates, as appears by the Grant annexed. The middle area to the we&s;t is entire, enlarging the windows, and break|ing convenient doors, for the original entrance to the we&s;t, is built up with a window in the Belfrey. The north area is almo&s;t demoli&s;hed, and many hou&s;es built out of the materials on the ground; in a yard behind the&s;e hou&s;es the ground plan may be traced with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, which has been cruciform. A very hand&s;ome modern-built Chapel, for the u&s;e of the town, was built &s;ome years ago on the &s;outh, and the Grammar School is kept in the we&s;t part, which is entire. I am well informed that &s;ome of the e&s;tates and revenues mentioned in the Grant of King Edward VI. have been alienated from the good purpo&s;es of the founder, are fallen at la&s;t into private property, and are &s;o held to this day.</P>

The tower has formerly had angular turrets at the north-ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t corners, with a com|munication by an open gallery which was &s;upported by projecting cor|bles: there is no portcullis. In the centre of the arched roof of the gateway is a &s;quare aperture, calculated to annoy a&s;&s;ailants who &s;hould gain the outward gate.

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BOTHALL,</HEAD>
<P>the <HI>baronial inheritance</HI> of the family of <HI>Ogles,</HI> di&s;tant from <HI>Morpeth</HI> about four miles. This ride is extremely beautiful, lying within a little di&s;|tance of the river Wan&s;beck, the banks of which to the &s;outh are lofty, and cloathed with fine hanging woods, through which here and there you &s;ee a bold promontory or rocky precipice. All the environs of the river to Bothal are romantic and beautiful. The <HI>ca&s;tle,</HI> though placed on a con&s;iderable eminence, yet &s;tands in a very deep vale; hanging woods forming an amphitheatre at the di&s;tance of about half a mile. Its pre|&s;ent remains chiefly con&s;i&s;t of the great gateway, flanked on the north &s;ide by two polygonal towers, 53 feet high; and on the &s;outh-we&s;t angle by a &s;quare turret, who&s;e height mea&s;ures 60 feet. From the towers of this gate the outward wall extends along the brink of the eminence, in
<PB N="306" REF="313">
a circular form, enclo&s;ing the area and interior buildings of the ca&s;tle. This enclo&s;ure contains about half an acre, in which are &s;ome &s;cattered fragments of the inner buildings, now affording no degree of certainty what were their original form and u&s;e. To the north-we&s;t of the gate|way, was formerly another tower, pulled down within the memory of per&s;ons living, which bore the denomination of Ogle's Tower. The &s;cite of this ca&s;tle to the &s;outh is very lofty, on the brink of a rock, who&s;e foot is wa&s;hed by the river: the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ides of the emi|nence have been defended by a moat. Mr Gro&s;e, to his &s;econd plate of this ca&s;tle, which chiefly repre&s;ents the gateway tower, &s;ays, <Q>the wood &s;cene in the back ground &s;lopes to the water's edge, here and there &s;kirted by picture&s;que rocks; and in many places the trees overhang the &s;tream, which here runs bri&s;kly, breaking again&s;t the huge &s;tones plentifully &s;cattered throughout its channel; at once cap|tivating the eye, and by its gentle murmurs &s;weetly &s;oothing the ear. Indeed the banks of the Wan&s;beck, between this place and Morpeth, afford a variety of &s;ylvan &s;cenes, equal in beauty to any in the king|dom.</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t de&s;cend to more minute de&s;criptions of the gateway with its towers;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This gate-way is of the &s;ame model as the gate of Alnwick ca&s;tle, and by its architecture and ornaments appears to be nearly of the &s;ame date.</NOTE> they bear a certain appearance of being the mo&s;t modern parts of this ca&s;tle; the architecture is excellent, and the edifice built of a durable &s;tone, well dre&s;t, and in good pre&s;ervation: the a&s;cent from the town is ea&s;y and gradual. The outward gate was defended by a portcullis; in the arching of the roof of the gateway, are three &s;quare apertures, from whence the garri&s;on could annoy the a&s;&s;ailants, when they had gained the fir&s;t gate; a door on each hand leads to the flank|ing towers. On the right hand, is a pa&s;&s;age and &s;tairca&s;e in the &s;outh|we&s;t tower; at the foot of the &s;tairs is a door into the pri&s;on, which is not &s;o horrible an enclo&s;ure as mo&s;t of tho&s;e &s;een in baronial ca&s;tles: it is above ground, and clo&s;ely arched, having narrow apertures, like loop|holes, to admit light and air from the gateway pa&s;&s;age. Oppo&s;ite to the&s;e &s;tairs, on the other &s;ide of the gateway, is a large hall. Pa&s;&s;ing the winding &s;tairs, we entered the &s;tate-room, above the gateway: this apartment is lighted by four windows, none of them of any con&s;ider|able &s;ize; the principal one is to the north, in the centre: by means of the thickne&s;s of the wall, the rece&s;s formed for the window is benched
<PB N="307" REF="314">
with &s;tone at the &s;ides, with &s;eats for &s;ix per&s;ons at lea&s;t. From this window you view the town, the church, and a narrow vale, through which the river flows. On each &s;ide of this window, is a door leading to the chambers of the flanking towers. The fire-place, of a very &s;pa|cious range, is to the ea&s;t, on the left &s;ide of which is another window with a rece&s;s, benched like that before de&s;cribed. A third window like the two former, is to the right of the door as you enter, looking into the area of the ca&s;tle; a large window to the we&s;t commands the wider part of the vale, and the fine hanging woods by which it is is bounded. Three large &s;tones cover the apertures in the floor, which open upon the pa&s;&s;age of the gateway. The upper rooms being more ruinous, are not &s;o ea&s;y to de&s;cribe, or their form capable of being a&s;|certained. I walked the&s;e apartments with a veneration, proceeding from the tendere&s;t obligations; an alliance with a lineal de&s;cendant of tho&s;e illu&s;trious families, who for ages po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this inheritance.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>In the front of the gateway, are &s;everal &s;hields of arms arranged in the following order; which I apprehend, like tho&s;e at <HI>Alnwick,</HI> perfectly point out to us the time when this part of the ca&s;tle was built. In the centre, in a large &s;hield, are the arms of <HI>England and France</HI> quarterly. It is ob&s;ervable that England takes the fir&s;t quarter, a thing I have never ob&s;erved an in&s;tance of before. On the dexter &s;ide, a &s;hield with the arms of <HI>England, three lions pa&s;&s;ant gardant;</HI> on the &s;ini&s;ter, a &s;hield with the arms of the Grays, <HI>barry of &s;ix argent and azure, three torteauxes in chiefe.</HI> This denotes that the erection was made in the time of Edward IV. who&s;e con&s;ort was a Gray, mother of Thomas Gray, who in the 15th year of that reign was created Marquis of Dor&s;et. Beneath, in the
<PB N="308" REF="315">
centre, the arms of Bertram, <HI>Or, an orl, azure.</HI> On the dexter and &s;ini&s;ter &s;ides of this, are three &s;hields, which denote the alliances of the Bertram family.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, on the dexter &s;ide, the arms of Percy</P>
<P>The &s;econd of Dacre</P>
<P>The third of Ve&s;ey, Or, a cro&s;s, &s;able.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, on the &s;ini&s;ter &s;ide, of Darcy</P>
<P>The &s;econd of Ha&s;tings</P>
<P>The third, two lions pa&s;&s;ant gardant in a tre&s;&s;ure; but to what fa|mily this coat armour appertains, I cannot form any probable a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>On the tower on the right hand of the gateway, are four &s;hields, the chief of which is of the Ogles; but as they are greatly defaced by time, and on my view did not &s;eem to have any material relation to the date or hi&s;tory of this erection, I pa&s;&s;ed them without particular atten|tion: but on con&s;idering the matter, I am induced to believe that John Ogle, the grand&s;on of the heire&s;s of Bertram, and who a&s;&s;umed the name of Bertram, erected this gateway. In the family of Ogles after|wards mentioned, he is particularly noticed.</P>
<P>In the centre, on the battlement, is the figure of a man, in &s;tone, in the attitude of &s;ounding a horn; on the right hand tower is another figure, holding a ball between his hands: the&s;e figures are greatly in|jured by the weather.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following curious &s;urvey of this ca&s;tle was publi&s;hed in the Antiquarian Repertory.</P>
<P>The following extract is copied from a &s;urvey called the book of Bothool Baronrye, in Nor|thumberland, mo&s;t beautifully written, and in high pre&s;ervation, the property of his Grace the Duke of Portland, to whom that barony now belongs. It was taken the 20th day of June; 1576, by Cuthbert Carnable, Robert Maddi&s;on, and John Law&s;on, tenants to that manor, by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion granted by Cuthbert Lord Ogle, and directed to the afore-named Cuth|bert Carnabie, Robert Maddi&s;on, Jacob Ogle, E&s;qrs Anthony Ratcliff and John Law&s;on, Gents. the whole 5, or any 4, 3, or 2 of them.

<P><Q>This <HI>barony</HI> was held by Robert of the King in capite, by the &s;er|vice of three Knights fees, as his ance&s;tors had formerly held it; the &s;aid lands being <HI>de veteri feofmento,</HI> and paying yearly for the ca&s;tle guard at <HI>Newca&s;tle upon Tyne</HI> for <HI>cornage</HI> 5l. 15s. 4d.</Q></P>

<P>A delightful &s;hady walk, of a mile long, leads to Sir John's port of <HI>Hartley,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a periodical publication, printed for Snagg, in Fleet-&s;treet, I find the following ac|count: <Q><HI>Cullicoats,</HI> a place otherwi&s;e of no great di&s;tinction, but worthy remembrance in this re&s;pect, that it is a very commodious little port, of artificial con&s;truction, or as the common people &s;tile it, an harbour made by hand. It is dry at low water and difficult at the entrance; but it &s;erves for coals and &s;alt belonging to the works of particular per&s;ons, at who&s;e expence it was con&s;tructed. <HI>Seaton Sluice</HI> was originally of the &s;ame kind. Sir Ralph Delaval was continually contriving new improvements, in the exerci&s;e of which he never he&s;itated at expence; and among&s;t the re&s;t made this port, on his own plan, and entirely at his own charge, for the benefit of his tenants and him&s;elf immediately, but with|out excluding others who cho&s;e to u&s;e it. In the con&s;truction of this &s;mall harbour he found enough to exerci&s;e his &s;kill and patience; the &s;tone pier which covered it from the north ea&s;t wind, being carried away by the &s;ea more than once; and when he had overcome this diffi|culty by u&s;ing timber as well as &s;tone, he felt a new inconvenience by his port's filling up with mud and &s;and, though a pretty &s;harp rill ran through it, which had &s;o hollowed the rock as to produce the very ba&s;on which Sir Ralph would convert into a haven. In order to remove this mi&s;chief, he placed a new &s;trong &s;luice, with flood-gates upon his brook, and the&s;e being &s;hut by the coming in of the Tyde, the back water collected it&s;elf into a body, and forcing a pa&s;&s;age at the ebb, carried all before it; and twice in 24 hours &s;coured the bed of the haven clean. King Charles II. who had a great ta&s;te for matters of this kind, made him collector and &s;urveyor of his own port.</Q></NOTE> whence his coals, well known in London by that name, are
<PB N="334" REF="346">
&s;hipped. There are al&s;o large &s;alt works and copperas works, and like|wi&s;e very con&s;iderable gla&s;s works, which were built by Thomas Delaval, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and purcha&s;ed of him by Sir John, who has cut through a &s;olid and hard rock a new entrance into his harbour, which is 52 feet deep 30 feet broad, and 900 feet long: this great work he did at his own private expence, which no per&s;on has any &s;hare or concern in but him|&s;elf: no &s;hips come hither except for his coals, &s;alt, gla&s;s, and copperas; the three la&s;t-mentioned works are carried on here for the &s;ake of con|&s;uming the &s;mall coals of his colliery, which would without them be of no value. Before this new entrance was effected, the opportunity for exportation here was very confined, as the &s;hips, for want of a &s;uf|ficient depth of water in the old entrance, were obliged to be loaded with keels, whereas they can now &s;ail out with their full loadings. The&s;e works produce to the public <HI>a revenue of above</HI> 20,000<HI>l. a year,</HI> and afford Sir John the means of con&s;tantly &s;upporting &s;everal hundred people who live upon his e&s;tate in hone&s;t indu&s;try, in which he and Lady Hu&s;&s;ey Delaval take great delight.</P>
<P>Sir John has al&s;o made a little harbour of refuge in <HI>St. Mary's I&s;land,</HI> for the &s;afety of the Fi&s;hermen upon this coa&s;t, by which many have been &s;aved who could not po&s;&s;ibly, in certain winds, have reached any other harbour.</P>

<P><PB N="335" REF="347">From <HI>Yevering Bell,</HI> and the eminences beyond <HI>Wooler,</HI> it has a noble appearance, ari&s;ing from a fine cultivated plain. <HI>This Ca&s;tle</HI> was re-edified by Sir John, the antique &s;tile being well pre&s;erved in the de&s;ign; two towers, one on the ea&s;t flank, and one on the we&s;t, being the only remains of the old ca&s;tle which are retained in this edifice. The work was begun in the year 1761, and compleated in two or three years. The front is to the &s;outh, the centre of which is formed by a &s;emi|hexagonal projection, and its terminations are &s;quare turrets; from whence, on each hand, a regular wing is advanced. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the area in front, is an old &s;quare tower of &s;ingular form, it being compo&s;ed of two turrets, one ari&s;ing above another; the upper one being &s;o much le&s;s than that which &s;upports it, as to afford a &s;pacious battlement. The area is enclo&s;ed by a wall embrazured and garni&s;hed with turrets, the entrance to which is by a &s;pacious gateway: the wall is defended by corner towers.</P>
<P>This ca&s;tle is &s;eated on the ea&s;t banks of the river Till: It appears by Madox's Exch. p. 647, that <HI>Sir William Heron</HI> built it in the 12th year of the reign of King Henry III. A.

<P>The ca&s;tle commands a fine pro&s;pect up the valley as far as Wooler bounded by lofty eminences, which ri&s;ing &s;wiftly, are broken in the mo&s;t agreeable and romantic manner. To the we&s;tward, at about the di&s;tance of a mile and a half, you view <HI>Flodden Hill,</HI> marked to the eye by a ri&s;ing plantation of firs,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Made by Sir John Hu&s;&s;ey Delaval.</NOTE> which crowns the eminence, and gives a beautiful object upon the land&s;kip. In great floods the Till over|flows &s;everal hundreds of acres of flat ground; the exten&s;ive &s;heet of water makes a grand appearance from the ca&s;tle: when it &s;ub&s;ides, the plain is left covered with a mo&s;t fertilizing mud, by which the &s;oil is greatly enriched.</P>
<P>From the happy ta&s;te her Lady&s;hip po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es for a rural life, Sir John has advanced the more rapidly in tho&s;e works of improvement which
<PB N="336" REF="348">
mark the adjacent country. The fair example becomes illu&s;trious, by the contra&s;t which is &s;een in the lives of per&s;ons of equal rank and opulence. The works which are &s;pread around <HI>Ford</HI> and <HI>Seaton Delaval,</HI> whil&s;t they di&s;pen&s;e felicity to innumerable laborious families, contri|bute greatly to the general opulence of the &s;tate. No panegyric can pay due prai&s;e to tho&s;e who thus employ their abundant wealth: the effect is not contracted within the circle of Sir John's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the example influences as it carries with it conviction, and many are thereby induced to cultivate and improve the adjacent e&s;tates, recovering from a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ages of ignorance, that the nature of the &s;oil and cli|mate would fru&s;trate their attempts. A va&s;t tract of land, on which you look from <HI>Ford,</HI> was within 20 years la&s;t pa&s;t, one continued &s;heep-walk; now inter&s;ected and enclo&s;ed with excellent quick-wood fences; the eminences adorned with fine plantations; the large and open farms which heretofore gave the country the a&s;pect of poverty and de&s;olation, are now &s;ubdivided, and let out into &s;maller allotments from 60l. to 200l. a year each, by which the country has become well peopled, and the lands, which for pa&s;turage did not yield above one &s;hilling per acre, now let for twenty-five &s;hillings. The vice of enlarg|ing farms, de&s;troying villages, and thereby depopulating a country, was advanced to &s;uch enormity in the reigns of King Henry VII. and King Henry VIII. that it called for a parliamentary inquiry and re&s;tric|tion. No language can more &s;trongly expre&s;s the error, than the pre|amble of the &s;tatute of the 25th of King Henry VIII. cha. 14. <Q>For as much as divers and &s;undry per&s;ons of the King's &s;ubjects of this realm, to whom God of his goodne&s;s hath di&s;po&s;ed great plenty and abundance of moveable &s;ub&s;tance, now of late within few years have daily &s;tudied, practi&s;ed, and invented ways and means how they might accumulate and gather together into few hands as well great multitude of farms as great plenty of cattle, and in e&s;pecial &s;heep, putting &s;uch lands as they can get to pa&s;ture, and not to tillage, whereby they have not only pulled down churches and towns, and enhanced the old rates of the rents of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of this realm, or el&s;e brought it to &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive fines, that no poor man is able to meddle with it, but al&s;o have rai&s;ed and enhanced the prices of corn, cattle, wool, pigs, gee&s;e, hens, chickens, eggs, and &s;uch other, almo&s;t double above the prices which have been accu&s;tomed; by rea&s;on whereof a marvelous multitude and number of the people of this realm be not able to provide meat, drink, and cloaths nece&s;&s;ary for them&s;elves, their wives and children; but be &s;o di&s;couraged with

It appears to me to be the ancient boundary mark of the priory di&s;trict: many obeli&s;ks of this kind being fixed on the boundaries of church lands in the northern counties.</P>
<P><Q>A gentleman in the neighbourhood remembers it &s;tanding, though in a tottering condition, and much out of the perpendicular: he thinks it was then near ten feet high: it has lately been thrown down and broken; two pieces of it are now remaining, one of which, mea&s;uring three feet and a half, has been &s;et up, the other, of about three feet, is the part repre&s;ented (in Mr Gro&s;e's plate) lying on the ground; on the pede&s;tal is the in&s;cription, <HI>O horror, to kill a man for a pigges head:</HI> the characters &s;eem more modern than the obeli&s;k. This monument is of a whin &s;tone; its plan, what is called an ob|long &s;quare: it is injured by time, and be&s;ides which, the country people have punched it &s;o full of round holes, and otherwi&s;e &s;o defaced it, as not only to render its ornaments unintelligible, but al&s;o to make it doubtful, whether all its &s;ides, or only the two broade&s;t were ornamented.</Q> The following traditionary &s;tory, relative to this monument, is al&s;o given by Mr Gro&s;e. <Q>A Monk of this mona&s;tery, &s;trolling abroad, came to the hou&s;e of Mr Delaval, an ance&s;tor of the ancient family of that name, who was then ab&s;ent on an hunting party, but was expected back to dinner: among the many di&s;hes preparing in the kitchen, was a pig ordered purpo&s;ely for Mr Delaval's own eating: this alone &s;uiting the liquori&s;h palate of the Monk, and though admoni&s;hed and informed for whom it was intended, he cut off the head, reckoned by epicures the mo&s;t delicious part of the animal, and putting it into a bag, made the be&s;t of his way towards the mona&s;tery. Delaval, at his return, being informed of the tran&s;action, which he looked upon as a per&s;onal in&s;ult, and

being young and fiery, remounted his hor&s;e, and &s;et out in &s;earch of the offender; when overtaking him, about a mile ea&s;t of Pre&s;ton, he &s;o belaboured him with his &s;taff, called a hunting gad, that he was hardly able to crawl to his cell. The Monk dying within a year and a day, although as the &s;tory goes the beating was not the cau&s;e of his death, his brethren made it a handle to charge Delaval with his murther; who before he could get ab&s;olved, was obliged to make over to the mona&s;tery, as an expiation of this deed, the manor of El&s;ig, in the neighbourhood of Newca&s;tle, with &s;everal other valuable e&s;tates; and by way of <HI>amende honourable,</HI> to &s;et up an obeli&s;k, on the &s;pot where he properly corrected the Monk. El&s;ig was afterwards made the &s;ummer retreat of the Priors of Tynmouth.</Q> <Q>This &s;tory, like many others of the like kind, is very defective in &s;everal parts; no date is affixed, and the above-mentioned monument is &s;hewn in &s;upport of it; it &s;eems difficult to account for this Monk being &s;o far from his mona&s;tery, e&s;pecially alone, which was &s;trictly prohibited by their rules: and this not being of the Mendicant order, he could not be going on the que&s;t. The only method of reconciling it, is to &s;uppo&s;e that this per&s;onage was a lay-brother, and &s;ervant to the hou&s;e. It however &s;hews how dangerous it was to injure the meane&s;t retainer to a religious hou&s;e: a peril very ludicriou&s;ly, though ju&s;tly expre&s;&s;ed in the following old Engli&s;h adage, which I have &s;omewhere met with: "<HI>If perchaunce one offende a Freeres Dogge, &s;treight clameth the whole brotherhood, an here&s;y! an here&s;y!"</HI></Q></P>

The approach to the priory in its pre&s;ent &s;tate is from the we&s;t, by a gateway tower of a
<PB N="342" REF="356">
&s;quare form, having a circular exploratory turret on each corner: from this gateway, on each hand, a &s;trong double wall has extended to the rocks on the &s;ea &s;hore, which from their great height have been e&s;teemed in former times inacce&s;&s;ible. The gate with its walls was fortified by a deep outward ditch, over which there was a drawbridge, defended by moles on each &s;ide. The tower comprehends an outward and interior gateway, the outward gateway having two gates at the di&s;tance of about &s;ix feet from each other, the inner of which is defended by a portcullis and an open gallery: the interior gateway is in like manner &s;trengthened by a double gate. The &s;pace between the gateways, being a &s;quare of about &s;ix paces, is open above, to allow tho&s;e on the top of the tower and battlements to annoy a&s;&s;ailants who had gained the fir&s;t gate. By dif|ferent accounts it appears, that there was a place of con&s;iderable &s;trength here in very remote antiquity: Camden &s;ays, <Q>there are &s;ome appre|hend that the rampier, not the (Roman) wall, went as far as to the very mouth of Tyne, and affirm it was called <HI>Pen-bal-crag,</HI> that is, <HI>the head of the rampier on the rock.</HI> I dare avouch, this was in the time of the Romans <HI>Tunnocellum,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing <HI>the promontory of Tunn or Tyne,</HI> where lay the fir&s;t cohort <HI>Aela Cla&s;&s;ica,</HI> enrolled (probably from the name) by <HI>Aelius Hadrianus,</HI> the Emperor, and in pay for &s;ea &s;er|vices: for the Romans had certain light pinnaces, termed <HI>Luforiae,</HI> upon the rivers.</Q>&mdash;What it was in the time of the Saxons, as a forti|fication, we have little or no evidence to be depended upon. The &s;i|tuation on the <HI>o&s;tium</HI> of &s;o important a river, and &s;o well calculated for the command of this &s;hore, induced <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> to order it &s;hould be converted into a fortre&s;s: the religious inhabitants were ill &s;uited to this plan, and the fir&s;t degradation of this mona&s;tery was by WALTHEOF Earl and Governor of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> at the command of his Sovereign, who it is known had very little veneration for religious in&s;titutions. At this period it was fortified with the wall and tower before de&s;cribed. <HI>Robert Mowbray,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> made choice of it for his &s;tronghold, when he rebelled again&s;t King William Rufus. But as it u&s;ually happens with rebels, he had ill &s;ucce&s;s: being clo&s;ely be&s;ieged, he withdrew him&s;elf into the mona&s;tery, and claimed the be|nefit of &s;anctuary, a protection pre&s;umed to be inviolable in tho&s;e days.

the name of Tynemouth Ca&s;tle; it belonged to the Earls of Northum|berland from the time of <HI>Waltheof</HI> for &s;everal generations.

In Camden's time it was in good repair: he &s;ays, <Q>it is now called Tynemouth Ca&s;tle, and glories in a &s;tately and &s;trong ca&s;tle.</Q> It was be&s;ieged by the Scots in 1644, when the garri&s;on were obliged to &s;ur|render to the arms of the Parliament, and &s;ubmit to their in&s;tructions. On this occa&s;ion there was delivered up 38 pieces of cannon, a great &s;tand of arms, with &s;tores of ammunition and provi&s;ion of very con&s;i|&s;iderable amount. Several of the garri&s;on, (it is &s;aid during a violent &s;torm) e&s;caped by the privies. A large &s;um was appropriated by Par|liament to re&s;tore the injury this fortre&s;s &s;u&s;tained in the &s;iege, and <HI>Colonel Henry Lilburn</HI> was made Governor: but he de&s;erting his party, the garri&s;on &s;oon after revolted. <HI>Sir Arthur Hezelrig,</HI> who lay at New|ca&s;tle, marched immediately to reduce them, and took the place by &s;torm: the men &s;caling the walls in the mo&s;t intrepid manner, at the mouths of the cannon, entered by the embrazures and port-holes; and after a &s;hort engagement with the garri&s;on within the fortifications, &s;oon became ma&s;ters of it. In the conflict <HI>Lilburn</HI> was &s;lain.</P>
<P>On pa&s;&s;ing the gateway, the &s;cene is &s;trikingly noble and venerable; the whole enclo&s;ed area may contain about &s;ix acres; the walls &s;eem as well calculated for defence as the gateway tower; the view is crowded with augu&s;t ruins; many fine arches of the priory are &s;tanding; the mo&s;t beautiful part of the&s;e remains is the ea&s;tern limb of the church, of elegant workman&s;hip. The ruins are &s;o di&s;united, that it would be very difficult to determine to what particular offices each belonged. On the &s;outh &s;ide, adjoining the wall which &s;tands on the brink of the cliff, are &s;everal &s;pacious vaulted chambers, one of which I conceived was the kitchen, from the large extended fire-place; another the pri&s;on, with an aperture in the top of the vault, by which the mi&s;erable cap|tive de&s;cended to his horrid dungeon. On the north and ea&s;t &s;ides, the cliffs appear to be about 10 perpendicular fathoms in height, at the feet of which, on a broken rocky &s;hore, the &s;ea beats impetuou&s;ly.

Two walls of the ea&s;t end of the church are &s;tanding; the end wall to the ea&s;t con|tains three long windows; the centre window, the loftie&s;t, is near 20 feet high, richly ornamented with mouldings; &s;ome of ro&s;e-work, and others of the dancette, as the figure is termed in heraldry, or zig-zag, a decoration common to old Saxon architecture. The divi&s;ions or pil|lars between the windows are enriched with pila&s;ters of five members, with highly fini&s;hed foliated capitals and cornices. Above the centre win|dow, is an oval one with like mouldings, and the openings of a gallery on each &s;ide. Part of the &s;outh &s;ide wall of the choir is al&s;o &s;tanding, illuminated with four windows of like form as tho&s;e to the ea&s;t, and equally ornamented, though not of the &s;ame height; for above them are an equal number of &s;mall windows: the divi&s;ions or pillars between the larger windows are decorated with pila&s;ters, of the &s;ame kind as
<PB N="345" REF="360">
tho&s;e at the ea&s;t end; in the divi&s;ions or pillars between the &s;maller windows, &s;pring the groins of the arches which formed the roof, by their remains &s;hewing they were ornamented with rich mouldings. The arches of the windows in this part are circular; the blank arches which are thrown upon the wall beneath the windows are pointed. The architecture through the whole of this part of the building is &s;ingularly light and beautiful; the erection con&s;i&s;ts of a red free&s;tone, which en|dures the weather well, in this &s;tormy &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Beneath the centre window at the ea&s;t end, is a doorway, of like ex|cellent workman&s;hip, conducting to a &s;mall but elegant apartment, which I conceive has contained the &s;hrine and tomb of St. O&s;wine. On each &s;ide of the door, is a human head, cut in a &s;tile much &s;uperior to that of the general ta&s;te of the age in which they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been executed. The apartment within is 18 feet in length, and nine feet in breadth and height. On the &s;outh &s;ide is an entrance from the open yard with two windows, on the north &s;ide three windows, and a cir|cular window to the ea&s;t, &s;o elevated as to give place for an altar be|neath: there are two niches for &s;tatues at the ea&s;t end, a clo&s;et for the ve&s;&s;els for &s;acred offices, and a ba&s;on for holy water: on each &s;ide of the window is the figure of a Monk kneeling, and two of the emble|matical animals commonly depicted with the Evangeli&s;ts: the &s;ide walls are ornamented with pila&s;ters, from whence &s;pring the groins and arches of &s;tone, which in various inter&s;ections form the roof; the joinings of which are enriched with circles of carved work, and the inter&s;tices of the roof are arched and con&s;tructed with thin bricks. The circles con|tain &s;culptures of the divine Per&s;onages with the Apo&s;tles, of workman|&s;hip far from being de&s;picable, and all the figures are in good pre&s;er|vation. Round each &s;culpture is a circular belt with a &s;entence in the old Engli&s;h character, well rai&s;ed, viz. <HI>Sanct. Petrus ora P. nobis,</HI> &amp;c. each varied by the name of the per&s;onage to whom it is in&s;cribed. The centre row con&s;i&s;ts of four circles; in one is the effigies of <HI>John the Bap|ti&s;t,</HI> with the like &s;entence; in a &s;econd, towards the we&s;t, the effigies of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> with a Monk kneeling; in a third, to the ea&s;t, the effigies of the <HI>Supreme,</HI> with the Lamb bearing an en&s;ign; and in the fourth, a repre&s;entation of the la&s;t judgment, with this &s;entence: <HI>In die judicii liberare nos.</HI> Above the door is the effigies of our Saviour with a globe in his hand, with <HI>morit P. nobis,</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed; on each &s;ide of the door, an emblematical figure, as to the ea&s;t. There are two e&s;cutcheons, the dexter one charged with bearings of Ve&s;ey, a cro&s;s &s;able; the &s;i|ni&s;ter,

<P>which is not improperly compared to Wapping: the &s;treets, lanes, and alleys are narrow, dirty, populace, and noi&s;y. It is a&s;toni&s;hing what bu&s;ine&s;s is ince&s;&s;antly going on here: we were told there lay in har|bour, even at that &s;ea&s;on of the year, above 400 &s;ail of &s;hips of con&s;i|derable burthen.

church was begun to be built in the year 1659: in the beginning of the reign of King Edward I. it con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ix fi&s;hermen's hovels. By the arguments in a cau&s;e depending between the King and his Bur|ge&s;&s;es of Newca&s;tle and the Prior of Tynemouth, in the 20th year of that reign, it appears, that the Prior had built a town upon the bank of the water of Tyne on one &s;ide, and the Prior of Durham another on the other &s;ide, where no towns ought to be, only lodges for fi&s;her|men; and that the fi&s;hermen had there &s;old their fi&s;hes, which ought to have been &s;old at Newca&s;tle: and that both the &s;aid Priors had cau&s;ed to be made breweries and fi&s;heries, having great &s;hips, whereas they ought to have had but boats; and had cau&s;ed bread to be baked there, which ought to have been baked at Newca&s;tle. It was decreed, that neither at Tynemouth or Shields there be any &s;ale of things &s;aleable, as in meats, drinks, &amp;c. and that &s;hips &s;hould not be laden or unladen there. This will &s;erve to &s;hew what was the &s;tate of this place in the 13th century.</P>
<P>We took a boat to examine this bu&s;y &s;cene upon the water: the &s;ight of &s;o many ve&s;&s;els, and &s;uch a concour&s;e of people, is very plea&s;ing: it con&s;equently brings to one's mind, reflections on the powers of human faculties. The genius of man is infinite; if we could be taught for 1000 years, we &s;hould di&s;cover at that period, from the learning we had acquired, that we had an infinity of &s;ubjects yet to learn: for the more knowledge man attains, the wider circle of objects unattained opens upon him. As the &s;cale of numerical calculation is without end; as the variations of mu&s;ical tones are infinite; &s;o is man's genius. By the u&s;e of letters we have accumulated the learning of ages; yet after the conclu&s;ion of a few centuries, all our acqui&s;itions will perhaps appear to po&s;terity, as but minute members of the &s;cience of mankind. Before the u&s;e of letters, with the fall of empires, the accumulated knowledge of ages expired with them; but henceforth it will not be &s;o.</P>

The ark of Noah was little better than a huge ca&s;k rolling on the face of the deep; who&s;e pre&s;ervation was miraculous, and not me|chanical, amid&s;t the perils of an univer&s;al ocean. The ve&s;&s;els of the Phoenicians were little &s;uperior to our lime-boats; their rigging and devices for &s;ailing greatly inferior: and the mo&s;t excellent of the Roman gallies comparable only to the gilded barges of a Lord Mayor's &s;hew. The mo&s;t &s;uperb ve&s;&s;el we read of in antiquity was con&s;tructed by Archimedes: <Q>it was a whole year in building&mdash;had twenty benches of oars; the enormous pile was fa&s;tened together on all &s;ides with huge nails of copper, that weighed each ten pounds and upwards: the in&s;ide had in it three galleries or corridors; the lowe&s;t of which led to the hold by a de&s;cent of &s;tairs; the &s;econd to apartments, and the fir&s;t to &s;oldiers lodgings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On the right and left &s;ide of the middle gallery, there were to the number of thirty apartments; in each of which were four beds for men. The apartment for the officers and &s;eamen had 15 beds, and three great rooms for eating; the la&s;t of which that was at the poop &s;erved for a kitchen. All the floors of the&s;e apartments were laid with &s;mall &s;tories in different colours, taken from the Iliad of Homer. The ceilings, windows, and all the other parts were fini&s;hed with wonderful art, and embelli&s;hed with all kinds of ornaments.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the uppermo&s;t gallery there was a gymna&s;ium or place of exer|ci&s;e, and walks proportionate to the magnitude of the &s;hip. In them were gardens and plants of all kinds, di&s;po&s;ed in wonderful order. Pipes, &s;ome of hardened clay and others of lead, conveyed water all round to refre&s;h them. There was al&s;o arbours of ivy and vines, that had their roots in great ve&s;&s;els filled with earth. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els were watered in the &s;ame manner with the gardens.

<P><Q>After the&s;e came the apartments of Venus with three beds. This was floored with agates and other precious &s;tones, the fine&s;t that could be found in the i&s;land.

In another apartment there was a library, at the top of which, on the out&s;ide, was fixed a &s;un-dial.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="374"><Q>There was al&s;o an apartment with three beds for a bath, in which were three great coppers, and a bathing ve&s;&s;el made of a &s;ingle &s;tone of various colours. This ve&s;&s;el contained 250 quarts. At the &s;hip's head was a great re&s;ervoir of water, which held an hundred thou&s;and quarts. All round the &s;hip, on the out&s;ide, were atla&s;&s;es of &s;ix cubits or nine feet in height, which &s;upported the &s;ides of the &s;hip: the&s;e atla&s;&s;es were at equal di&s;tance from each other. The &s;hip was adorned on all &s;ides with paintings, and had eight towers, proportioned to its bigne&s;s; two at the head, two at the &s;tern, and four in the middle, of equal dimen&s;ions. Upon the&s;e towers were parapets, from which &s;tones might be di&s;charged upon the &s;hips of an enemy that &s;hould approach too near. Each tower was guarded by four young men compleatly armed and two archers; the in&s;ide of them was filled with &s;tones and arrows.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Upon the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el, well &s;trengthened with planks, was a a kind of rampart, on which was an engine to di&s;charge &s;tones, made by Archimedes: it threw a &s;tone of 300 weight and an arrow of 12 cubits the di&s;tance of a &s;tadium or 125 paces. The &s;hip had three ma&s;ts, at each of which were two machines to di&s;charge &s;tones. There al&s;o were the hooks and great lumps of lead to throw upon &s;uch as approached. The whole &s;hip was &s;urrounded with a ram|part of iron to keep off tho&s;e who &s;hould attempt to board it. All round were iron graplings di&s;po&s;ed, which being thrown by the ma|chines, might catch hold on the enemy's ve&s;&s;el, and draw them clo&s;e to the &s;hip, from whence it was ea&s;y to de&s;troy them.

Severus's wall has very manife&s;tly terminated in a &s;quare fort or &s;tation, above a furlong to the ea&s;t of the man&s;ion called Cou&s;ins's Hou&s;e. The ruins of a Roman &s;tation and town at this place are very di&s;cernible, though it has all been ploughed, and is now a very rich meadow. The &s;tones and rubbi&s;h of the buildings are levelled, and covered with earth and gra&s;s, but yet the ramparts of the fort may be di&s;tinctly traced out, both they and the ditch being vi&s;ible, almo&s;t quite round.</P>
<P>In Mr Warburton's Vallum Romanum, and Mr Hor&s;ley's Brit. Rom. are the following particulars, which I will tran&s;cribe, as at the time I vi&s;ited this &s;tation I could not traver&s;e the ground without injuring the crops growing. <Q>There are very evident remains of two turrets at the we&s;tern and ea&s;tern entries to the &s;tation, and of another at the &s;outh|we&s;t corner. The we&s;t entry has been clo&s;e to the wall, and the ea&s;tern one directly oppo&s;ite to it. The fort has been about 140 yards, or perhaps &s;ix chains &s;quare, and &s;o the contents of it above three acres and an half. About 60 yards of the we&s;tern and ea&s;tern &s;ides lie without, or to the north of the line of the wall, and eighty within it; &s;o that the wall falls upon the &s;ides of the &s;tation, not far from the middle of them. The &s;outh rampart of this fort is about three quarters of a furlong from the river &s;ide, and runs along the brow of the hill, or at the head of a con&s;iderable de&s;cent from thence to the river. There have been ruins of buildings on this part and to the &s;outh-we&s;t of the fort; but they are now &s;o levelled and covered, that little evidence appears above ground; yet the &s;tones and remains of rubbi&s;h are ea&s;ily di&s;covered, when the &s;urface is any where removed: and &s;ome of the&s;e inequalities in the &s;urface, which u&s;ually ari&s;e from ruins, yet remain, and may ea&s;ily be perceived to be hillocks of &s;tones or rubbi&s;h.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr Hor&s;ley gives the following in&s;criptions as belonging to this place:</P>
<P>I. Cohortis primae centuria Fiari po&s;uit.</P>
<P>This &s;tone with the five next (as al&s;o a piece of an altar and part of a pede&s;tal) are all placed in niches in the out&s;ide of the wall belonging to Cou&s;ins Hou&s;e, where they have &s;tood unob|&s;erved and neglected for many years, and being expo&s;ed to the winds and weather, have &s;uffered very much by that means. I cannot find that the lea&s;t notice has been taken of them before; the four fir&s;t are plainly centurial, &s;uch as were generally placed in the face of the wall, and are rarely found in any other &s;tation. Hence we have one argument, that this &s;tation was built at the &s;ame time with the wall, in the reign of Severus. The cohorts mentioned in the&s;e in|&s;criptions were certainly legionary. The mark for the century is very clear and di&s;tinct in all of them, and the names of the centurions, as in mo&s;t others of the &s;ame kind, are in the geni|tive. For which rea&s;on, I think, that the mark is not to be read centurio, but centuria, (as it is frequently read in Gruter) and that <HI>po&s;uit</HI> is to be &s;upplied or under&s;tood at the end; &s;o that <HI>cohortis primae centuria fiari,</HI> is much the &s;ame as to &s;ay, &s;uch a Captain's company of &s;uch a regiment. Indeed <HI>centurio cohortis,</HI> or the centurion of a cohort, does often occur in in&s;crip|tions, but does not nece&s;&s;arily imply, that the whole command of the cohort was in a &s;ingle centurion; for we have al&s;o <HI>centurio legionis</HI> and <HI>miles legionis,</HI> which can &s;ignify no more than &s;uch a per&s;on was a centurion or a &s;oldier in &s;uch a legion.</P>

a right angle, and then is continued down to the &s;ide of the river: but it is the we&s;tern rampart of the &s;tation which makes that angle with the wall: nor does this rampart reach the river, though it is likely the town or buildings without the fort may have extended &s;o far. On the north &s;ide of the &s;tation there are &s;ome crooked ri&s;ings and &s;etlings of the ground, which at fir&s;t view appeared to me not unlike a round fort or tower, projecting from the &s;tation with a triple rampart and ditch. The two clo&s;es in which the Roman town and &s;tation have &s;tood, are called Wall Lawes. If the name Lawes be owing to the ri&s;ing ground only, the termination Lawes or Lowes, which &s;ignifies hills, &s;o far cor|re&s;ponds to the Roman name Segedunum. But as there were two di&s;|tinct Tumuli ob&s;erved by Mr Warburton remaining near a place he calls the Beehou&s;es, and not far from the&s;e clo&s;es, he apprehends that from them they have borrowed this name; a Lawe or Lowe being one of tho&s;e names by which Tumuli are frequently expre&s;&s;ed. There was an altar and &s;ome centurial in&s;criptions at Cou&s;ins's Hou&s;e, in Mr Hor&s;leys time.</P>

The following account of this place and its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, I have extracted from the notes of Mr Bourne's Hi&s;tory of Newca&s;tle, page 114:</P>
<P><Q>It has been handed down by tradition to the pre&s;ent day, that this was a place of retreat for King John, when he came into this coun|try; and there are &s;till to be &s;een the ruins of an ancient building, which carries the name of King John's palace. On the north &s;ide of this old building are the remains of a fortification, which 'tis natural to conjecture was built for the &s;afety and &s;ecurity of this hou&s;e, and con&s;equently this hou&s;e mu&s;t have been of &s;ome great di&s;tinction. Robert de Gaugy was a great man in the reign of King John, and had &s;pecial tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him by his Sovereign, and it is not im|probable when the King came to the&s;e parts he lodged at this hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The pre&s;ent hou&s;e was built in the year 1713, and is &s;o &s;ituated, that on the we&s;t it overlooks the Town Moor, Fenham, and part of the lands of the Prior of Tinmouth; on the ea&s;t it faces the Shields road; on the north it has a mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pect to the windings of the Ou&s;e burn, of its woods and banks, and of the villages &s;ituated on it; on the &s;outh it faces the river Tyne.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hardriding, near Haltwhi&s;tle, is the ancient &s;eat of the Ridley fa|mily: above one of the old doors there a date earlier than the con|que&s;t appears, and the initial letters of the builder N. R. This was a younger branch of the Ridleys of Willimote&s;wicke: of which branch was John Ridley, a Major in the &s;ervice of King Charles I. in the Duke of Newca&s;tle's army.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Bi&s;hop Nicholas Ridley was of this branch, and was born <HI>here</HI> (Mr Bourn &s;ays) I pre&s;ume he means at Hardriding. He was educated

<P>As to the two in&s;criptions you &s;ent me, I will venture to give you my thoughts on them, not doubting but you will excu&s;e me where I differ from you, &s;ince what I offer proceeds only from a love of truth, and no &s;pirit of altercation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them is very curious, as it gives us the name of a <HI>Legatus Augu&s;talis &amp; Propraetor,</HI> hitherto unknown in Britain, and which ought, as I think, to be read as follows.</P>

<P>To read G R in the 4th line <HI>Gregulium</HI> is not a little doubtful; it cannot well be &s;uppo&s;ed that the tribune of the cohort would dedicate an alter to the deity of the Emperor, and at the &s;ame time to the genius of the common &s;oldiers, exclu&s;ive of the genius of the officers, of which he him&s;elf was one; and how to read it otherwi&s;e is as uncertain, if the letters are G R as in your copy: but if they are C R, as on the altar given us by <HI>Mr Hor&s;ley,</HI> Durham, No. 26, in his Brit.

</LETTER></NOTE> but of what importance or magnitude the Roman &s;tation was which

occupied a part of this ground, no evidence appears.

If there was once a Roman &s;tation here, every ve&s;tigia thereof mu&s;t long &s;ince have been de&s;troyed, by the works of a large populous and ancient town. The remains of the <HI>Roman wall,</HI> or wall of <HI>Severus,</HI> have frequently been di&s;covered by workmen, in digging the foundations of buildings in tho&s;e parts of the town through which it lay. It pa&s;&s;ed from the we&s;t through the Vicarage gardens, the Groat Market, the north part of St. Nicholas's church, and from thence to <HI>Pandon Gate.</HI> This gate bears &s;ingular marks of antiquity; the &s;uper&s;tructure is of different workman&s;hip and model from any others on the town wall; the arches are circular, and there appears that natural decay on the whole &s;truc|ture, which might happen in &s;uch a number of years. Camden &s;ays, <Q>at Pandon Gate there remains, it is pre&s;umed, one of the turrets of the Roman wall, differing in form and workman&s;hip from the others on the walls of the town.</Q> By the dimen&s;ions which I took of this gateway, I find it nearly-corre&s;ponds with the other ports or gates in the Roman wall. It is &s;aid the Carpenters Tower is al&s;o of Roman ori|ginal. The reputed antiquity of <HI>Pandon Gate</HI> is denoted in a proverb of common acceptation: <HI>"As old as Pandon Yates."</HI></P>
<P>We have no authorities to fix the certain aera when or by whom this place was fir&s;t inhabited from the evacuation of the Romans, or how long it remained de&s;erted after their departure: like other &s;trongholds within the defence of the Roman wall, it is rea&s;onable to conceive it was very early re&s;orted to by the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Britons, and was kept up by them as a place of &s;ecurity again&s;t the northern rovers. The fir&s;t name we find it di&s;tingui&s;hed by in hi&s;tory was <HI>Monkche&s;ter,</HI> <Q>which &s;hews that it was noted for being the habitation of religious men.</Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE> What &s;ociety of religious (and whether Saxons or not) took up their

re&s;idence here, at what time they fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the place, or when they were expelled, are circum&s;tances unknown: all the evidence re|maining is the name only. <HI>Bede</HI> in his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory and Life of St. Cuthbert is totally &s;ilent relative to them; and as his re&s;idence was at <HI>Jarrow,</HI> &s;ituated within a few miles, and he died in 735, the name of <HI>Monkche&s;ter</HI> and the re&s;idence of tho&s;e religious mu&s;t have &s;uc|ceeded his death. Mr Pennant &s;ays, <Q>their de&s;truction mu&s;t have been early, for the venerable Bede takes no notice of the place. The ruin therefore of this place cannot be attributed to the Danes, who&s;e fir&s;t inva&s;ion did not take place till after the death of that Hi&s;torian.</Q> It appears to me the argument holds the other way; for had it been the re&s;idence of any religious &s;ociety who &s;uffered per&s;ecution, before or in the time of <HI>Bede,</HI> he would have noticed it. Fifty-nine years elap&s;ed between the time of <HI>Bede</HI>'s death and the fir&s;t de&s;cent of the Danes on Northumberland: in this period of time the increa&s;e of reli|gious hou&s;es was very rapid, and it is rea&s;onable to conceive &s;uch ex|amples as <HI>Landisfarn</HI> and <HI>Jarrow</HI> had produced, would greatly promote like in&s;titutions in their neighbourhood. From Hollin&s;head's authority we are induced to believe, that on the vi&s;itation of <HI>Aldwin, Alfrin,</HI> and <HI>Remfrid,</HI> in 1074, <Q>there was not a mona&s;tery remaining in this part of Northumberland, and &s;carce a church was left &s;tanding.</Q></P>
<P>This was a de&s;irable &s;ituation for the Danes, when they entered the Tyne: and to that aera I am inclined to fix the de&s;truction of the reli|gious &s;ociety which had &s;ettled here, and from who&s;e re&s;idence the name of <HI>Monkche&s;ter</HI> was derived.</P>
<P>In 1080, when <HI>Robert Courtho&s;e,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> re|turned from his Scotch expedition, he halted here to refre&s;h his army; and finding the &s;ituation proper for a fortre&s;s to command the turbu|lent Borderers, and the river well adapted for the reception of &s;uccours by &s;ea, as well as trade, built a <HI>ca&s;tle</HI> here, to which he gave the name of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> in contradi&s;tinction (it is &s;aid) to a &s;mall circular tower<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bourne.</NOTE> which the Monks held, or to the Roman turrets on the wall.</P>
<P>From this period we may date the growing importance of the place: the protection of a fortre&s;s on the banks of &s;o fine a river, would draw thither a great number of &s;etlers, and trade would &s;oon begin to flouri&s;h
<PB N="371" REF="386">
under &s;uch propitious circum&s;tances. There was &s;o rapid a progre&s;s in its improvements, that before the death of King David I. of Scotland, who held it as a member of his <HI>earldom of Northumberland,</HI> it was be|come a place of great importance, David having founded here two mona&s;teries.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tanner, 391. Keith.</NOTE> Tanner &s;ays a nunnery was founded here as early as the conque&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> was defended by a &s;trong wall, and an outward ditch of great depth, now much gone to decay. From Leland's account it appears, that this fortification was begun in the reign of King Edward I. and compleated in the reign of King Edward III. A rich citizen hav|ing been taken pri&s;oner in the middle of the town, by the ha&s;ty irrup|tion of a hardy band of Scots, who would not &s;et him at liberty with|out a con&s;iderable &s;um for his ran&s;om, on his return he &s;et about to &s;ecure his native place by a wall; his fellow-citizens promoting &s;o important a work for the protection of their merchandize and riches. In the 19th year of the reign of King Edward I. the royal licence for fortification was obtained.

<P>Having de&s;cribed the walls, I mu&s;t in the next place con&s;ider the interior fortre&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> all authors agree, was built by <HI>Robert Carthou&s;e,</HI> &s;on of William the Conquerer, in the year 1080, on his return from his Scotch expedition: he perceived the great con&s;equence of &s;uch a for|tre&s;s on the frontiers, commanding &s;o fine a river, and in a &s;ituation excellently calculated for a&s;&s;embling the northern levies on any di&s;|turbance on the borders. The tower built by <HI>Robert</HI> was of great &s;trength, &s;quare, and &s;urrounded by two walls: the height of the tower is 82 feet, the &s;quare on the out&s;ide 62 feet by 54, the walls 13 feet thick, with galleries gained out of them: there was a chapel within the tower.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE> The outward fortifications are now defaced, and their &s;cite crowded with buildings. The tower &s;till remains entire, the corners projecting from the plane of the &s;quare, a mode much practiced in the Norman &s;tructures. It is &s;ituate on a lofty eminence, commanding the whole town: the principal entrance is on the &s;outh. What num|ber of gates were in the outward wall we cannot now determine, but from Bourne's account of it, which I &s;hall quote in its proper place: the area inclo&s;ed by this wall contained three acres and one rood. The Ca&s;tle belongs to the county of Northumberland, and makes no part of the liberties of Newca&s;tle, or its Sheriffdom: the government of it, 21&s;t September, 1&s;t of King Henry VII. was granted to William
<PB N="377" REF="392">
Clo&s;e, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for life as Con&s;table; and in the 9th year of the &s;ame reign it was granted to Roger Fenwick, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> with 20l. per annum &s;alary; &s;ince which time I do not find that any Con&s;table has been appointed, but the Sheriffs of Northumberland had cu&s;tody of the Ca&s;tle. It now &s;erves for the county pri&s;on, and in the great hall the Judges of a&s;&s;ize hold the gaol delivery.</P>
<P>Soon after the building of this ca&s;tle, it is &s;aid by Bourne that <HI>Robert de Mowbray</HI> Earl of Northumberland, when in rebellion again&s;t King William Rufus, was be&s;ieged therein, and this fortre&s;s after &s;uffering much damage was taken: but I confe&s;s I do not find &s;ufficient autho|rities to &s;upport this a&s;&s;ertion of my author, and think it is much to be doubted. The Scots by treachery A. D. 1135, in the 1&s;t year of the reign of King Stephen, gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle and town, which they held to the year 1156, when Malcolm IV. ceded the northern counties to King Henry II.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the 3 yere of Henry the 2. the King of Scottes had the Erledom of Lanca&s;tre yn his handes, the cite of Cairluel, Bamburgh Ca&s;tel and Newca&s;tel.</P>

<P>The ca&s;tle having &s;uffered much by neglect in that and the &s;ucceed|ing reign, King John re&s;tored it, and added a ditch to the fortifica|tions, in doing which he was obliged to de&s;troy &s;everal hou&s;es: as a compen&s;ation to the owners of the&s;e tenements he ordered 110s. 6d. rents in e&s;cheats to be paid yearly, as is &s;et forth in his charter to the town.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The records have of late years been &s;trictly kept, and much intere&s;t mu&s;t be u&s;ed to have acce&s;s to the archieves: to me, who&s;e intention was chiefly to make a de&s;criptive view, &s;uch applications were not of &s;uch moment as they are to the learned compiler from whom we may in a little time hope to receive a compleat <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of Newca&s;tle.</NOTE> This ca&s;tle was con&s;idered of &s;uch con&s;equence, that mo&s;t of the neighbouring Baronies paid con&s;iderable &s;ums towards its &s;upport, under the articles of Ca&s;tleward and Cornage: the &s;everal &s;ums are mentioned in Bourne's hi&s;tory.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P><PB N="378" REF="393">Bourne &s;ays, <Q>In the 9th of King Edward III. an inqui&s;ition was taken at this town, whereby it was found that at the time of the battle of Bannockburn, which was in the year 1313, when John de Kenont, Knight, was High Sheriff of Northumberland, the Ca&s;tle and all its edifices about it were in good repair: that after that time Nicholas Scot, Adam de Swinburn, William Riddel, Johannes de Fenwick, Cuthbert de Broughdon, Johannes de Fenwick, Johannes de Woodhorn, Johannes de Lilleburn, Willielmus de Tynedale, Roger Mauduit, and Robertus Darreius, were High Sheriffs of Northum|berland, during which time the great tower, and al&s;o the le&s;&s;er ones of the &s;aid Ca&s;tle, the great hall, with the King's chamber adjoining to it, together with divers other chambers below in the Queen's mantle, and the buttery cellar and pantry: the King's chapel within the ca&s;tle, a certain hou&s;e beyond the gate which is called the chequer hou&s;e, with the bridges within and without the gate, with three gates and one po&s;tern, were 300l. wor&s;e than before. They al&s;o &s;ay that there are in the cu&s;tody of Roger Mauduit, late High Sheriff, 420 fother of lead: they &s;ay al&s;o, that it was thought highly nece&s;&s;ary that the Baron Heron of Hudde&s;ton, the Baron of Walton, Lord Robert Clifford of the New Place, Chief Lord of the Barony of Gaugie, the Lords of the Barony of &mdash; and Devil&s;ton, that the Lord of Werk upon Tweed, the Lord of the Barony of Bol|beck alias Bywell, the Baron of Bothal, and la&s;tly the Baron of Delaval, &s;hould build each of them a hou&s;e within the liberties of the ca&s;tle for the defence of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There were two great &s;trong walls which &s;urrounded the ca&s;tle: the interior wall was of no great di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle it&s;elf, as may be &s;till &s;een in &s;everal places. The exterior wall &s;urrounds the verge of the ca&s;tle borders. From this outer wall were four gates, the great gate and three po&s;terns. The north &s;ide of the ca&s;tle is the main gate, called now the Black Gate; it had two port culice&s;&s;es, one without the gate, as may be &s;till &s;een, and another within it, at a little di&s;|tance from it, the ruins of which were to be &s;een a few years ago. There &s;till remains a piece of the old wall, which &s;hews its &s;ituation to have been where that hou&s;e is, which was lately purcha&s;ed by Mr Ja&s;per Harri&s;on. The &s;hop belonging to this hou&s;e was dug (as I am informed) out of the wall ju&s;t now mentioned. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the ca&s;tle there was a po&s;tern, which led down to the &s;treet called the Side, which is &s;till to be &s;een: it was once called (but many years
<PB N="379" REF="394">

On the &s;outh &s;ide of the ca&s;tle is another gate, which leads down the Ca&s;tle Stairs to the &s;treet called the Clo&s;e: this was the &s;outh po&s;tern. There is a building upon it, which was the county Goaler's hou&s;e. On the we&s;t &s;ide was the po&s;tern facing Bailiff Gate; now the dwelling-hou&s;e of James Lid&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is an hou&s;e in the yard, which they &s;ay was the chapel of of the garri&s;on, which is called the chapel hou&s;e to this day: it &s;tands north-ea&s;t from the chapel; its common name now is the Three Bulls-heads.</Q></P>
<P>By an inqui&s;ition taken in the reign of King James I. it appears this ca&s;tle was then much out of repair; and in the 18th of the &s;ame reign another having been taken, complaint was made that a great dunghill, heaped up again&s;t the wall on the we&s;t &s;ide of the ca&s;tle, had done damage to the amount of 120l. it was under the &s;ame inqui&s;ition com|plained, that the great &s;quare tower was full of chinks and crannies, and that one-third of it was almo&s;t taken away; that all the lead and coverings which it had of old, were embezzled and carried off, in&s;o|much, that the pri&s;oners of the county of Northumberland were mo&s;t mi&s;erably lodged, by rea&s;on of the &s;howers of rain falling on them. The computation made for repairs was 809l. 15s. In 1644, the dung|hill was taken away by Sir John Morley, and it is &s;aid was u&s;ed to make a rampart on the town walls again&s;t the Scots: he al&s;o repaired the round tower under the Moothall, now called the Half-moon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wallis</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>It has been (continues Bourne) a building of great &s;trength, and no little beauty; the va&s;t thickne&s;s of the walls &s;peaks the one, and the ruins of &s;ome curious workman&s;hip the other. The grand en|trance into the ca&s;tle was at the gate facing the &s;outh, which leads up a pair of &s;tairs (which &s;till &s;hews the magnificence of the builder) to a very &s;tately door of curious ma&s;onry. The room this leads into, has its floor broken down clo&s;e to the ca&s;tle wall, as indeed all the other floors are, to the top of the ca&s;tle; &s;o that excepting the floor above the county gaol, there is not one left, though there have been five divi&s;ions or &s;tories of the ca&s;tle, be&s;ides this.

<ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> when he was Mayor in 1722, &s;eems to me, without any doubt, to have been the common hall of the ca&s;tle, becau&s;e on the north &s;ide of the &s;ame room, there is an entrance by a de&s;cent of &s;ome &s;teps into a room, where is the large&s;t fire place I &s;aw in the ca&s;tle, which plainly &s;peaks it to have been the kitchen. At the end of this there are &s;everal &s;tairs, which lead into a place under the kitchen, which I think goes down as low as the bottom of the ca&s;tle: this I take to have been a cellar, as I do al&s;o that little dark place on the right hand coming up again, to have been a &s;ort of pantry. The door I mentioned ju&s;t now on the ea&s;t of the ca&s;tle, which leads to the fir&s;t broken down floor, is becau&s;e of its grandeur and beauty, an argument that this room has been the mo&s;t &s;tately one in the whole ca&s;tle: another rea&s;on for its being &s;o is, becau&s;e of the win|dows which gave light into it; tho&s;e of them that face the ea&s;t are the mo&s;t beautiful of the whole ca&s;tle be&s;ide. On the &s;outh of this room there is an entrance into a &s;ort of a parlour or withdrawing room, which has a fire place in it, and has been a piece of curious workman&s;hip, as is vi&s;ible to this day; and this place has no com|munication with any part of the ca&s;tle but this room. On the north &s;ide of this room, is a door leading into an apartment where &s;tands a well of con&s;iderable depth; it was 18 yards before we touched the &s;urface of the water; which &s;eems to have been placed there on pur|po&s;e for the more immediate &s;ervice of this room. There are &s;ome little ba&s;ons on the top of the well, with pipes leading from them, which conveyed water to different apartments of the ca&s;tle: this is plain from what may be ob&s;erved in the county gaol, at the bottom of the ca&s;tle; the round &s;tone pillar in it having an hollow in the middle, of a foot wide, with a lead &s;pout in the &s;ide of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the inqui&s;ition made in the 9th of King Edward III. above men|tioned, among other things that were complained of for being ne|glected, one was, Capella Domini Regis infra ca&s;trum.

The door of it is at the bottom of the &s;outh wall of the ca&s;tle, adjoining to the &s;tairs which lead into the &s;tate chamber. It has been a work of great beauty and ornament, and is &s;till, in the mid&s;t of du&s;t and darkne&s;s, by far the mo&s;t beautiful place in the whole building; the in&s;ide of it being cu|riou&s;ly adorned with arches and pillars.

parts of it, the entrance, the body of it, and the chancel: on the left &s;ide of the entrance you go into a dark little room, which undoubtedly was the ve&s;try; the full length of it was 15 yards, the breadth &s;ix yards and a half; it had three or four windows towards the ea&s;t, which are now all filled up; nor is there any light but what comes in at a little cranny in the wall.

capital Bailiff 1269; but the &s;cite of it was given by three &s;i&s;ters, who&s;e names have long &s;ince been ungratefully buried in oblivion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When was the particular time of its building, I have met with no account; but it is not difficult to give a probable gue&s;s. The order it&s;elf, of the Dominicans or Black Friars, came into England in the year 1221; con&s;equently it mu&s;t have been founded after that time: and that it mu&s;t have been founded &s;ome years before the year 1280, is plain to a demon&s;tration; for in that year, which was the 8th of King Henry I. the Black Friars had licence from the King, to break a door through this new or town wall into their garden; which proves them a regular &s;ettled body at that time; and therefore that their priory was built &s;ome years before that licence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We are told that this mona&s;tery was in old time called the Grey Friars, which, in my opinion, is a thing highly improbable; for the Grey Friars or Franci&s;cans came not into England till about the year 1224; and if, as I have proved above, the Black Friars were a &s;et|tled body &s;ome years before 1280, how is it po&s;&s;ible, to have been called of old time, the Grey Friars? This is therefore a mi&s;take: and be&s;ides, the Dominicans came into England before the Franci&s;cans or Grey Friars, and therefore more probably were &s;ooner in this place.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It has been a very &s;tately building, as appears by the pre&s;ent re|mains of it. The area or gra&s;s plot is about 87 feet in length, and as many in breadth. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of it was the chapel, which is now the hall of the company of Smiths in this town. On the we&s;t &s;ide of it, is a curious old well, which &s;erved the mona&s;tery with water, called our Lady's Well. On the &s;outh may &s;till be &s;een, the ruins of a curious front, on which &s;ide is the hall of the Cordwainers; in which I &s;aw a pair of winding &s;tairs, which they told me (before they were walled up) led by a vault as far as the nunnery of St. Bar|tholomew. On the north of it were their gardens, a part of which was the Warden's Clo&s;e, before the building of that part of the town wall. This appears by the charter granted to the mona&s;tery in the reign of Edward I. about the breaking out that narrow gate in the wall between We&s;tgate and Newgate; in which grant it is &s;aid, that the wall went through the middle of their garden. The mona&s;tery was dependant on the priory of Tynemouth.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="400"><Q>In the reign of Edward II. the brethren of this mona&s;tery had li|cence granted them for the building of a draw bridge beyond the new ditch of the ca&s;tle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Who were the Priors of this mona&s;tery; what eminent men be|longed to them; or what things were tran&s;acted by them from their beginning till their di&s;&s;olution; were things undoubtedly pre&s;erved among them&s;elves whil&s;t they were a body; but after their &s;urrender, were either de&s;troyed, or have not yet come to light.</Q></P>
<P><Q>One of the Priors of this mona&s;tery was one Richard Mar&s;hall. I take this gentleman to have been the la&s;t Prior of this mona&s;tery; for in the 28th of King Henry VIII. a grant of a tenement near the White Cro&s;s (&s;igned by Friar Richard Mar&s;hall, Doctor and Prior; and Friar David Simp&s;on, and Friar John Sourby) was given to An|thony God&s;alve, upon his paying to the &s;aid priory or mona&s;tery 9s. per annum. This grant is now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr Thomas Mar|&s;hall of Newca&s;tle, Joiner, who purcha&s;ed this tenement, and has lately rebuilt it. He pays the &s;ame rent to the town of Newca&s;tle, which the tenement paid to the mona&s;tery. About two years after the &s;igning of this deed, in January, the 30th of this reign, this mo|na&s;tery &s;urrendered. It con&s;i&s;ted of a Prior and 12 Friars.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What became of the brethren of this friary, after their &s;urrender; what they had allowed them annually for a maintenance; or whether they had any thing allowed at all does not appear. Some account in|deed I met with afterwards of the Prior him&s;elf, but none of the Friars.</Q> It is this which follows.</P>
<P><Q>Richard Mar&s;hall, Prior of the Black Friars in Newca&s;tle about the year 1551, went into Scotland and preached at St. Andrew's, that the Pater-no&s;ter &s;hould be addre&s;t to God and not to the Saints. Some Doctors of the univer&s;ity being di&s;gu&s;ted at this a&s;&s;ertion, pre|vailed with one Tofts, a Grey Friar, to undertake to prove that the Pater-no&s;ter might be &s;aid to the Saints; who&s;e ignorance in doing the &s;ame was &s;o manife&s;t, that he became the common je&s;t, and quitted the town.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After the &s;urrender of this mona&s;tery, the Black Friars was granted to the town of Newca&s;tle, in con&s;ideration of 53l. 7s. 6d. The annual value of it was 2l. 19s. 6d.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="401"><Q>The King &s;ays in his grant, that he gives to the Mayor and Bur|ge&s;&s;es of Newca&s;tle, the whole hou&s;e and &s;cite lately a priory, or hou&s;e of brethren, called vulgarly the Black Friars, in Newca&s;tle upon Tyne; the chapel-hou&s;es, edifices, gardens, &amp;c. the hall, two chambers, a chamber called the Cro&s;s Chamber; and two gardens with their ap|purtenances; and the whole clo&s;e within the We&s;tgate, and another clo&s;e near the &s;cite of the &s;aid priory, on the north; and a clo&s;e con|taining three acres, and a hou&s;e in the &s;ame clo&s;e, without the walls of the &s;aid town; and a hou&s;e called the Gatehou&s;e &s;ituated near the &s;aid &s;treet. It al&s;o appears from the fir&s;t grant, that the King re|&s;erved to him&s;elf and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors the bells and lead that was upon the church belonging to this friary, and the other buildings of it; the lead in the gutters, together with the &s;tones and iron of the church, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Nine Crafts of this town had their meeting-hou&s;es or halls in it, and &s;till have except two of them, the Taylors and the Cordwainers, who have be&s;towed the&s;e upon &s;ome poor widows, and got them&s;elves others in their places. The&s;e halls are of great &s;ervice to this ancient building, in pre&s;erving it from intire ruin. Such is the hall of the Smiths, which was repaired by them in the year 1709: the hall of the Dyers; the hall of the Bakers and Brewers, which was repaired by them in the year 1711: the&s;e halls are on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the friary. Such al&s;o are tho&s;e on the we&s;t &s;ide of it, viz. the hall of the Sadlers, which was repaired by them in the year 1729, and the hall of the Skinners and Glovers, which was repaired by them in the year 1721. Such are tho&s;e al&s;o on the &s;outh &s;ide of it, viz. the Cordwainers hall, which was turned into apartments for three widows in the year 1729: the hall of the Butchers and the hall of the Tanners were repaired in the year 1717.</Q></P>

King Henry I. founded an ho&s;pital here for the reception of lepers, called the Ho&s;pital of St. Mary Magdalen, &s;ituated near Barras Bridge, without Pilgrim-&s;treet Gate, and therein fixed a Ma&s;ter, Bre|thren, and Si&s;ters.

So happy a relief has this charitable in&s;titution proved, that from the time of its commencement to April 1778, 17,331 patients have been di&s;charged cured.</P>
<P>To the&s;e may be added the Ho&s;pital for Lunatics, and the Ho&s;pital for Married Women lying-in: as al&s;o the fund rai&s;ed for the &s;upport of tho&s;e who lie-in at their own hou&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="419"><HI>An elegant Hall</HI> has lately been erected in High Friar Chair, by the &s;ociety of <HI>Free and Accepted Ma&s;ons</HI> of the Lodge of St. John: it is richly ornamented, and has an excellent organ for their &s;olemn rites. It was dedicated in the year 1777; to attend which ceremony, there was the mo&s;t re&s;pectable and numerous convention of that order that ever ap|peared in the northern parts of this kingdom. The mu&s;ic was per|formed by an excellent band, the vocal parts of which were done by the be&s;t voices from the quire of Durham cathedral. A pathetic exhor|tation was delivered by Mr Huntley, and an elegant oration, di&s;play|ing the antiquity, progre&s;s, and excellence of the order, by the Rev. Dr Scott of Simonburn. The fe&s;tival was held in the new a&s;&s;embly room, when at three tables near 400 of the brethren dined together; at which time that regularity, order and harmony were maintained, for which this &s;ociety, above all others in the world, is remarkable: where men of all ranks, political opinions, and religious per&s;ua&s;ions meet, without envy or contention; and pre&s;erve a unanimity and bro|therly love, in de&s;pite of the frailties and ficklene&s;s of the human heart.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this place is very dark, antecedent to the time of Ro|bert Carthou&s;e, and the building of the ca&s;tle, from whence it is pre|&s;umed the name of Newca&s;tle was derived. The advantages of a fine navigable river, with a &s;ituation defended by &s;o &s;trong a fortre&s;s, would &s;oon induce Merchants and others to fix there; yet we find no record of any royal charter, liberty, or franchi&s;e granted to the &s;ettlers, till the reign of King Henry II. when they obtained a royal charter, which is &s;aid to have comprehended great privileges;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gardiner, ch. 2. p. 7.</NOTE> but of what nature the&s;e were, our author is &s;ilent. King John, in the 3d year of his reign, confirmed the above charter, on payment of 100 marks and two palfreys.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Madox Firma Burgi, p. 54.</NOTE> In the 14th year of his reign he greatly enlarged tho&s;e li|berties and powers, and expre&s;sly <Q>in con&s;ideration of the loyalty and faithful &s;ervices of his burge&s;&s;es there,</Q> he granted them &s;everal ex|clu&s;ive privileges; among which are, an exemption from the power of the Sheriff of the county at large, and that they &s;hould be amenable to the Courts only within their own juri&s;diction, except in matters rela|tive to the rights of the Crown. The government of the borough was then under four Bailiffs only.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="420">King Henry III. by charter, appointed a Mayor to pre&s;ide in the government of this borough, together with four Bailiffs. From this Prince the Burge&s;&s;es derived two mo&s;t excellent bounties, viz. the Ca&s;tle Deme&s;nes, containing 850 acres, for free pa&s;turage, with liberty of win|ning coal and &s;tone; as al&s;o a plot of ground called the Forth, contain|ing about 11 acres. Here the Infirmary &s;tands: a portion of the ground is inclo&s;ed, and converted into a public walk. One thing very &s;ingular in this royal charter, is the prohibition again&s;t Jews re&s;iding within the borough.</P>
<P>This was one of the boroughs that received the fir&s;t &s;ummons to &s;end Repre&s;entatives to &s;it in a Hou&s;e of Commons, in the 10th year of the reign of King Edward I. A. D. 1282.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><TABLE>

But that neither the &s;entence of deprivation, nor the Queen's letters patents were of &s;ufficient force to recover the honours, lands, &amp;c. to the See of Durham; therefore to re&s;tore the Bi&s;hoprick to its former intere&s;t, privileges, and revenues, the two di&s;&s;olution &s;tatutes of the la&s;t reign are hereby repealed."</NOTE></P>
<P>Queen Elizabeth confirmed to the Burge&s;&s;es all the liberties and im|munities granted by her predece&s;&s;ors, and added thereto many privileges by her charter dated, as Mr Wallis &s;ays, on the 22d March, in the 42d year of her reign; but as it appears by a note to Bourne's Hi&s;tory, in the 31&s;t year of that reign.

<P><PB N="415" REF="430">Two ancient puni&s;hments, inflicted on the di&s;turbers of the peace here, are worthy notice.</P>
<P>A common Drunkard was led through the &s;treets as a &s;pectacle of contempt, covered with a large barrel, called a Newca&s;tle cloak&punc; one end being out, and the other having a hole made through it, &s;ufficient for the offender to pa&s;s his head through; by which means the ve&s;&s;el was re&s;ted on his &s;houlders.</P>

<P>Queen Elizabeth granted a charter to the Fraternity called Free Ho&s;tmen for the vending of Coals, re&s;erving a duty of 12d a chaldron.</P>

<P>The quantity of a Ten of coals is uncertain, and not always the &s;ame, but commonly 16 Newca&s;tle chaldrons make a ten. Two keels al&s;o make a ten, and 11 waggons a keel. Each waggon contains 19 bolls and upwards, at 36 gallons to a boll, and 9 bolls or thereabouts go to a fother, and three fothers and a quarter make a chaldron; 21 corves to a &s;core, and 55 fother make a ten.</P>

ve&s;&s;els find con&s;tant employ on this river. No ve&s;&s;els exceeding 400 tons come up to the Quay.</P>
<P>The collieries which &s;upply this exportation, about 24 in number, lie at con&s;iderable di&s;tances from the river. From the mines, the coals are &s;ent to the places of lading in large unwieldy carriages or waggons, of the form of a common mill-hopper, carried on four wheels of iron, the fellies or rims of which are hollow, &s;o as to run upon &s;trings of wood adapted thereto, with which the roads are laid. By this means, the&s;e carriages on an ea&s;y de&s;cent run without hor&s;es, and &s;ometimes with that rapidity, that a piece of wood, called a tiller, is obliged to be applied to one wheel, and pre&s;&s;ed thereon by the weight of the at|tendant who &s;its on it, to retard the motion: by the friction of which frequently the tiller and &s;ometimes the carriage is &s;et on fire.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the year 1775, 697, 608 chaldrons of coals were im|ported in the port of London from Newca&s;tle, and Sunderland on the the river Wear, in the county of Durham; which is 37,237 chaldrons more than the year 1773, and 77,237 chaldrons more than in the year 1774. In the year 1776, 600,000 chaldrons were imported at London.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A manu&s;cript note in the margin of Bourne's Hi&s;tory of Newca&s;tle, in Fi&s;her's Circulating Library, p. 159.</NOTE></P>
<P>In 1775, 4773 &s;hips were cleared at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e of Newca&s;tle; of which 4343 were coa&s;tways, and 430 for foreign parts; being upon the whole 270 le&s;s than in the year 1774.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The great export of this place is coal, for which it has been noted for &s;ome centuries. It is not exactly known at what time that &s;pecies of fuel was fir&s;t dug. It is probable that it was not very early in general u&s;e. That the Romans &s;ometimes made u&s;e of it appears in our for|mer volume, p. 55: but &s;ince wood was the fuel of their own country, and Britain was over|run with fore&s;ts, it was not likely that they would pierce into the bowels of the earth for a le&s;s grateful kind. But it was exported to foreign parts long before it was in u&s;e in London; for London likewi&s;e had its neighbouring fore&s;ts. We find that in 1234, King Henry III. confirms to the good people of Newca&s;tle, the charter of his father King John, granting them the pri|vilege of digging coals in the Ca&s;tle Moor, and converting them to their own profit, in aid of their fee-farm rent of one hundred a year; which moor was afterwards granted to them in property by Edward III. The time of the fir&s;t exportation of coals to London does not appear. In 1307, the 35th year of Edward I. they were con&s;idered in the capital as a nui&s;ance; for on the repeated complaints of Prelates, Nobles, Commons of Parliament, and Inhabitants of Lon|don, again&s;t the &s;tench and &s;moke of coals u&s;ed by Brewers, Dyers, and other Artificers, the King i&s;&s;ued out his proclamation again&s;t the u&s;e of them: which being di&s;regarded, a com|mi&s;&s;ion of Oyer and Terminer was i&s;&s;ued, to puni&s;h the di&s;obedient with fines for the fir&s;t of|fence, and for the &s;econd, by the de&s;truction of their furnaces. In 1379, we find that their u&s;e was not only tolerated, but their con&s;umption made beneficial to the &s;tate; for in that year a duty of &s;ix-pence per ten each quarter of a year was impo&s;ed on &s;hips coming from Newca&s;tle. In 1421, the trade became &s;o important as to engage the regulations of government, and or|ders were given about the lengths of the keels, &s;o that the quantity of coal might be a&s;cer|tained. From that period the commerce advanced continually.

<P>Newca&s;tle was the &s;eat of many remarkable occurrences and events. On the incur&s;ion made by David I. King of Scotland, A.

David having made this place his head quarters, remained there till a truce was entered into with King Stephen, who lay with his army at Dur|ham.</P>
<P>On the re&s;titution of Newca&s;tle to the Crown of England, King Henry II. confirmed to the burge&s;&s;es and inhabitants their e&s;tates, and granted them an exemption from tolls and duties.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="434">King John and William the Lion King of Scotland, about the year 1209, met at Newca&s;tle, and held a conference. The Scotch King lay ill here for a con&s;iderable time.</P>

<P>In the year 1244, King Henry III. a&s;&s;embled a great army and marched to Newca&s;tle, whil&s;t the King of Scotland marched to Ponte|land. There were 5000 hor&s;e among the Engli&s;h troops finely armed. In the Scotch army were 1000 hor&s;e with armour of iron or network, to which were added 100,000 foot; but no engagement en&s;ued, as Alex|ander, who before had denied King Henry's &s;upremacy, now &s;ubmitted to acknowledge Henry as his liege Lord, and agreed to bind him&s;elf not to enter into any league with any of the enemies of the King of England.</P>
<P>In the year 1251, Newca&s;tle had its fir&s;t Mayor, Petrus Scott, Knt.</P>
<P>In 1276, on the eve of St. Nicholas, great earthquakes were felt here, accompanied with dreadful lightnings and thunders, the appear|ance of a fiery dragon in the heavens, and a blazing &s;tar.</P>
<P>In the year 1292, after the Regency of Scotland was di&s;&s;olved, Baliol &s;wore fealty to King Edward I. in the ca&s;tle of Norham, in the pre|&s;ence of many of the Nobility of both nations. The next day the royal commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued, directing John St. John to place Baliol in the royal chair at Scone, according to the ancient mode of inauguration of the Kings of Scotland: in which duty St. John repre&s;ented Duncan Earl of Fife, then a minor, who&s;e hereditary office it was gained by his ance&s;tors for their di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervices. This ceremony was &s;oon after performed on St. Andrew's day; after which Baliol pa&s;&s;ing into England, did homage to King Edward on Chri&s;tmas day at Newca&s;tle, in the hall of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In the year 1296, an open rupture taking place between the two kingdoms, the Scots profe&s;&s;ing to throw off the Engli&s;h yoke, King Edward appointed the 1&s;t day of March for his rendezvous at New|ca&s;tle,

<P>An act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed 3d June 1772, to enable the Bi&s;hop of Durham and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to rai&s;e a competent &s;um of money, to be applied for the repairing, improving, or rebuilding &s;uch part of Tyne Bridge as belongs to the See of Durham.</P>
<P>On the 10th June 1772, one Stephen&s;on contracted to build a tem|porary bridge over the Tyne in four months time, under a great pe|nalty; which was performed.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day 25th April 1775, the fir&s;t &s;tone of the &s;outh pier of the new bridge, within the boundaries of this Corporation, was laid by Sir Matthew White Ridley, Mayor.</P>
<P>From the evidence of the ancient name of Pons Aelii and the Roman road from Che&s;ter leading thereto, it is conjectured that the Romans had a bridge here.</P>
<P>Mr Pennant is of opinion, <Q>that part of the Roman bridge remained till the late inundation; for from the ob&s;ervation of workmen upon the old piers, tho&s;e as well as the piers of the bridge at Bywell, &s;eem originally to have been formed without any &s;prings for arches. This

was a manner of building u&s;ed by the Romans, witne&s;s the bridge built over the Danube by Trajan at Severin, who&s;e piers (he believes) &s;till exi&s;t. Adrian was probably the founder of the bridge at New|ca&s;tle, which was called after his family name Pons Aelii, in the &s;ame manner as Jeru&s;alem was &s;tyled Elia Capitolina, and the games he in&s;tituted at Pincum in Mae&s;ia, Aeliana Pincen&s;ia. The coins di&s;co|vered on pulling down &s;ome of the piers in 1774, confirm my opinion. Several were di&s;covered, but only three or four re&s;cued from the hands of the workmen. All of them are coins po&s;terior to the time of Adrian, probably depo&s;ited there in &s;ome later repairs. One of them is a beautiful Fau&s;tina the Elder after her deification.

<P>This &s;tone was found near the highway &s;ide by <HI>Denton,</HI> and is now in my own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. <HI>Herennius Herennianus</HI> occurs in a remarkable in&s;cription found in <HI>Spain,</HI> and publi&s;hed in the Tran&s;actions.

<P>This &s;tation on <HI>Benwell Hill</HI> has furni&s;hed a good many in&s;criptions; but I remember not to have &s;een or heard of any <HI>Roman coins</HI> found here, nor can I &s;ay in the general that Roman coins are &s;o frequent in the &s;tations on the wall as in &s;ome other places; but <HI>the fine urn</HI> which they now pre&s;erve in <HI>the Library at Durham</HI> was found at this place. The cut of the letters in the in&s;criptions belonging to <HI>Benwell</HI> is tolerably good, and the in&s;criptions them&s;elves are not &s;o much perplexed with ligatures of letters, as tho&s;e of later dates often are, though the&s;e are not wholly free from them. But the mo&s;t curious in&s;criptions have been removed out of this county: many were carried off by <HI>Sir Robert Cotton,</HI> &s;everal of which are yet remaining at <HI>Connington</HI> near <HI>Stilton</HI> in <HI>Hantingdon&s;hire;</HI> but they al&s;o are going to ruin, for the &s;ummer-hou&s;e where they were carefully placed by <HI>Sir Robert</HI> being now uncovered, and in a ruinous &s;tate, the &s;tones and in&s;criptions have already &s;uffered very much.</P>
<P><HI>Mr Warburton</HI> had made the large&s;t collection, who was at a great deal of pains and expence to collect the mo&s;t curious Roman &s;tones he could find in this county, but he unhappily broke many of them in order to make them more portable, and &s;o carried off only that part of the &s;tone which had the in&s;cription; by this means it has happened that many of the &s;tones col|lected by him are only faces of altars, and in &s;everal in&s;tances the in&s;criptions them&s;elves have &s;uffered damage by this unhappy frugality. What this gentleman had collected together at <HI>Hexham</HI> have &s;ince been removed to <HI>the Library at Durham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mr Warburton</HI> in his <HI>Vallum Romanum</HI> ju&s;tifies him&s;elf again&s;t this charge in the following manner: <Q>The editor, in vindication of him&s;elf from this unju&s;t accu&s;ation of a par&s;imonious incurio&s;ity, denies the charge in every part; and as a proof of the truth thereof refers him&s;elf 
<PB N="437" REF="452">to the draughts of the altars he di&s;covered, as the &s;ame are repre&s;ented in the plates.

feint marks of the Ditch and north Agger begin to appear, but chiefly of the latter; and this &s;tate of the Vallum extends to <HI>Benwell Fort.</HI> As to Severus's Wall, little or nothing relating to it can be di&s;covered be|tween
<PB N="437" REF="452">
the town and the Quarry Hou&s;e: &s;ome vi&s;ible remains of a ca&s;|tellum are di&s;coverable ju&s;t behind the Quarry Hou&s;e, and the line of the wall appeared to go through the mid&s;t of the hou&s;e. The ca&s;tellum is conveniently placed for pro&s;pect, and is the only one that is vi&s;ible between <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> and the next &s;tation: by the di&s;tance there &s;hould have been another, but it is quite demoli&s;hed. From the <HI>Quarry Hou&s;e</HI> to <HI>El&s;wick</HI> Windmill, Severus's wall is difficult to trace; but from thence to the fort on <HI>Benwell Hill,</HI> the appearance of the ditch is fre|quently very di&s;tinct, and the track of wall (which keeps much upon the high road) pretty certain.</P>
<P>From the &s;tation at <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> (which is placed by the&s;e Antiquaries near the ca&s;tle) to <HI>Benwell Hill,</HI> is near two miles and a furlong, and no in&s;criptions have been di&s;covered in this &s;pace; at lea&s;t none now remain, nor even the remembrance of any.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the &s;tation on <HI>Benwell Hill</HI> is high, and the pro&s;pect con&s;iderable: the ramparts are large and di&s;tinct, but the ditch &s;carce to be di&s;cerned. Hadrian's vallum &s;eems to have fallen in with the &s;outh &s;ide of it, and Severus's wall &s;trikes upon the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ides, &s;o as to leave three chains to the north and &s;ix to the &s;outh; but there is no appearance of the wall and its ditch being continued through the fort, though <HI>Mr Gordon</HI> has &s;o repre&s;ented it. There are &s;tones in the road that now cro&s;&s;es this fort, but the&s;e &s;eem only to have been taken
<PB N="438" REF="453">
out of the ruins to repair the highway. This &s;tation falls in cour&s;e to be <HI>Condercum,</HI> the name given in the <HI>Notitia</HI> to be the third in the &s;e|ries, where the <HI>Ala Prima A&s;torum</HI> was quartered.</P>
<P>From the &s;tation at <HI>Benwell Hill,</HI> Severus's wall and ditch, in going down to <HI>Denton,</HI> continue much in the &s;ame &s;tate as before; but Ha|drian's work on this &s;ide begins to appear more con&s;picuous; both the walls pa&s;s to the north of the hill and village of <HI>Benwell;</HI> from <HI>Denton</HI> to the <HI>Chapel Hou&s;es,</HI> both the walls and their ditches are almo&s;t all the way vi&s;ible and di&s;tinct: over-again&s;t <HI>We&s;t Denton Hall</HI> there &s;eemed to be the vi&s;ible remains of a ca&s;tellum, and &s;omewhat like the ruins of a Turret not very far from it.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Chapel Hou&s;es,</HI> about a furlong &s;outh from Severus's wall, and le&s;s from Hadrian's, are &s;omewhat like the ruins of a rampart: it is called <HI>the Ca&s;tle Steads,</HI> the name u&s;ually given to tho&s;e ca&s;tella that are regularly placed along Severus's wall; but this (be&s;ides its being at &s;ome di&s;tance from the wall, which the others never are) appears to have been of a quite different form and dimen&s;ions; for it is about four chains long, with an interval in the middle, that looks like a gate, and &s;o makes it appear very like the &s;outh rampart of a &s;mall fort: but if there have been ramparts on the other &s;ides, no traces of them ap|pear at pre&s;ent. The pro&s;pect here, e&s;pecially to the &s;outh, is very con|&s;iderable; perhaps it has been an exploratory tower belonging to Ha|drian's work, and prior to Severus's, and &s;o neglected in his time. The u&s;ual ca&s;tellum belonging to Severus's wall, is about a furlong we&s;t from the <HI>Chapel Hou&s;es,</HI> and vi&s;ible there; &s;o that the other can neither be one of the&s;e, nor intended to &s;upply the place of one. From the name <HI>Chapel Hou&s;es,</HI> one would expect to find &s;ome ruinous <HI>chapel</HI> there; and I &s;hould have &s;u&s;pected &s;omewhat of the&s;e ruins to have been of that nature, if the name <HI>Ca&s;tle Steads</HI> had not determined again&s;t it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Chapel Hou&s;es</HI> to <HI>Wallbottle</HI> both walls and ditches are pretty vi&s;ible, and continue &s;o to <HI>Newburn Dean:</HI> but on the de&s;cent from the <HI>Chapel Hou&s;es</HI> to <HI>Wallbottle,</HI> Hadrian's north Agger becomes very con|&s;picuous, and holds &s;o for the mo&s;t part to <HI>Newburn Dean.</HI> Between <HI>Wallbottle</HI> and this <HI>Dean</HI> is a ca&s;tellum &s;till very vi&s;ible; and from the Dean to <HI>Throcklow,</HI> Hadrian's vallum and ditch are di&s;cernible, but not very large, and Severus's wall not quite &s;o plain.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="454">Over-again&s;t <HI>Throcklow,</HI> in a convenient high place, there &s;eems to be the ruins of another ca&s;tellum; but near the village the vallum is very ob&s;cure. From <HI>Throcklow</HI> to <HI>Heddon on the Wall,</HI> Severus's wall and ditch are very con&s;picuous, and Hadrian's vallum and ditch near as vi&s;ible. The north Agger is al&s;o di&s;cernible for part of the way, and near <HI>Heddon</HI> it is very con&s;iderable. Before we come to <HI>Heddon,</HI> there is on the north &s;ide of the wall, another place of the &s;ame nature with that at <HI>Chapel Hou&s;es,</HI> and called likewi&s;e <HI>Ca&s;tle Steads.</HI> The re|mains are very confu&s;ed, and as it is altogether on the north of the wall, and detached a little from it, it &s;eems to be a ca&s;tellum erected prior to the wall, and neglected after the building of it. The pro&s;pect from this place is very good, which makes it the more likely to have been of the exploratory kind. However there &s;eems to have been an u&s;ual ca&s;tellum in Severus's wall, very near to the&s;e ruins; which is a further proof, that the other has not been u&s;ed after the wall was erected. It &s;eems to have been twice as large as one of Severus's ca&s;|tella, and yet not large enough for a &s;tation. Three &s;ides, the north, ea&s;t, and we&s;t, may be traced out, but the other is entirely levelled.</P>

<P>Near <HI>Heddon on the Wall</HI> &s;omewhat appears like Severus's military way, pretty near to his wall; but it is rather probable this appearance is nothing but the &s;tones and ruins of the wall, and that the military ways have here coincided, becau&s;e the north Agger is &s;o large, though in a ploughed field: not far from this place there have been &s;ome re|markable <HI>Tumuli.</HI> The village <HI>Heddon Lawes,</HI> which &s;tands upon a

<P>At this village, on the 28th of Augu&s;t, 16 King Charles I. A. D. 1640, Lord Conway with an army of 3000 foot and 1500 hor&s;e, oppo&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age of the Scots over the river Tyne, led by Le&s;ley.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Ru&s;hworth's Hi&s;torical Collections, there is a very particular relation of this affair, p. 1236.</P>
<P><Q>On the twenty &s;eventh of Aug. (1640) in the forenoon, his Maje&s;ty received intelligence from the Lord Conway, that the Scots would that night be near Newca&s;tle with their army, craving his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure and directions about the di&s;po&s;ing of his army to the interrup|tion of the march of the Scots.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The King immediately called the Gentry of York&s;hire, then at York, together, to wait upon his Maje&s;ty, to whom the Earl of Strafford made a &s;peech, pre&s;ently after he prepared a pacquet to be &s;ent po&s;t to the Lord Conway, then under&s;tanding the Scots were come near Newca&s;tle; and the author of the&s;e Collections being newly come po&s;t from London to York, and hearing a pacquet was about to be &s;ent to Newca&s;tle, took the opportunity to bear the me&s;&s;enger company therewith: but when the author and the me&s;&s;enger with the pacquet came to Newca&s;tle upon the 28th of Augu&s;t in the morning, they were informed, that the Lord Conway was gone to the army near Newburn, whither we went immediately, and found the Lord Conway and the Field Officers at a Council of War at Stella, half a mile di&s;|tant from the army, and delivered the Lord Conway the pacquet, which being opened, it contained &s;pecial orders to prepare the army for an engagement with the Scots. Whil&s;t 
<PB N="442" REF="457">they were in debate in this matter an Herald came in all ha&s;te from the army, to acquaint the Lord Conway and Council of War, that the army was already engaged with the Scots; which &s;eemed &s;trange to them, becau&s;e orders were given not to fight but upon the defence.</Q></P>
<P>On the 27th of Augu&s;t, <Q>The Scots pitched their tents on Heddon Law, above Newborne, from whence there went a continued de&s;cent to the river of Tyne. In the night time they made great fires in and round about their camp, on an open moori&s;h ground, (having coals plenty thereabouts) &s;o that the camp &s;eemed to be of large compa&s;s and extent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That night and the next morning they &s;uffered any Engli&s;hman to come into their camp, and made them welcome, with expre&s;&s;ions of great love and prote&s;tations of doing harm to none but tho&s;e who &s;hould oppo&s;e them in demanding ju&s;tice of the King again&s;t incendiaries.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The &s;ame night part of the King's army, con&s;i&s;ting of 3000 foot and 1500 hor&s;e, were drawn forth into a plain meadow ground, which was near a mile in length, clo&s;e on the &s;outh &s;ide of Tyne, called Newborne Haugh or Stella Haugh, to hinder the Scots from pa&s;|&s;ing the river in the night time, where were two &s;everal &s;conces or brea&s;t-works, rai&s;ed by the Engli&s;h again&s;t the two fords, which the Scots might pa&s;s over at low water, for 'till then they could not pa&s;s the Tyne, and into each &s;conce were put four hundred mu&s;queteers and four pieces of ordinance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The hor&s;e were drawn into &s;quadrons in the &s;aid Haugh, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the foot; in this po&s;ture hor&s;e and foot guarded the river all that night and the next day, till the engagement.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Scots all the forenoon watered their hor&s;es at one &s;ide of the river, and the Engli&s;h on the other &s;ide, without affronting one another, or giving any reproachful language.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Scots having the advantage of the ri&s;ing ground above Newborne, ea&s;ily di&s;cerned the po&s;ture and motion of the Engli&s;h army below in the valley, on the &s;outh &s;ide the river; but the po&s;ture of the Scots army the Engli&s;h could not di&s;cern by rea&s;on of the hou&s;es, hedges, and inclo&s;ures in and about Newborne. The Scots brought down cannon into Newborne town, and planted &s;ome in the church &s;teeple, a &s;mall di&s;tance from the river Tyne: their mu&s;|queteers were placed in the church, hou&s;es, lanes, and hedges, in and about Newborne.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The &s;kirmi&s;h began thus, (as the author of the&s;e Collections was informed, being then upon the place) a Scotti&s;h officer, well mounted, having a black feather in his hat, came out of one of the thatcht hou&s;es in Newborne, and watered his hor&s;e in the river Tyne, as they had done all that day; an Engli&s;h &s;oldier perceived he fixed his eye towards the Eng|li&s;h trenches on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river, fired at him, (whether in earne&s;t or to fright him is not known) but wounded the Scotchman with the &s;hot, who fell off his hor&s;e, where|upon the Scotti&s;h mu&s;queteers immediately fired upon the Engli&s;h, and &s;o the fight begun with &s;mall &s;hot, but was continued with great &s;hot as well as &s;mall.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The Scots played with their cannon upon the Engli&s;h brea&s;t-works and &s;conce; the King's army played with their cannon to beat the Scots out of the church &s;teeple; thus they con|tinued firing on both &s;ides, 'till it grew to be near low water, and by that time the Scots, with their cannon, had made a breach in the greater &s;conce, which Colonel Lunsford com|manded, wherein many of his men were killed and began to retire, yet the Colonel prevailed with them to &s;tand to their arms; but pre&s;ently after a Captain, a Lieutenant, and &s;ome other officers were &s;lain in that work: then the &s;oldiers took occa&s;ion to complain, that they were put upon double duty, and had &s;tood there all night and that day to that time, and that no &s;oldiers were &s;ent from the army at Newca&s;tle to relieve them; but Col. Lunsford again prevailed with them not to de&s;ert their works, but another cannon &s;hot hitting in the works among&s;t the &s;ouldiers, and killing &s;ome more of them, they threw down their arms, and would abide in the fort no longer.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="458"><Q>The enemy on the ri&s;ing ground above Newbourne, plainly di&s;cerned the po&s;ture of the King's army, and how the &s;ouldiers had quit the great work, and being low water, the Scots commanded a forlorn party of 26 hor&s;e, being gentlemen of the College of Ju&s;tice Troop, to pa&s;s the river, which they did with &s;ome &s;wiftne&s;s; their orders were only to make di&s;covery in what po&s;ture the &s;ouldiers were about the uppermo&s;t work, but not to come to clo&s;e engagement, but fire at a di&s;tance and retreat.</Q></P>
<P>The Scots playing at this time very hard upon the furthermo&s;t trench, forced the Engli&s;h <Q>foot to retreat from that work al&s;o, which the Scots di&s;cerning on the ri&s;ing ground at Newborne, commanded by Sir Thomas Hope, and two regiments of foot commanded by the Lord Craford, Lind&s;ey, and Lord Lowdon, waded through the river, and General Le&s;ley at this in&s;tant of time played hard with nine pieces of cannon, from a new &s;conce which they had rai&s;ed on a hill to the ea&s;t, and &s;o galled the King's hor&s;e, drawn up in plain meadow ground, that it much di&s;ordered them, and &s;ending more forces over the river, a retreat was &s;ounded, and Colonel Lunsford drew off the cannon. Immediately Commi&s;&s;ary Wil|mot, &s;on to the Lord Wilmot, Sir John Digby, a Romi&s;h Recu&s;ant, and Daniel O'Neal, an Iri&s;hman, jointly engaged the enemy, and had a &s;harp encounter with their hor&s;e, they being commanded to bring up the rear, whil&s;t the foot retreated up Ryton and Stella Banks; but the Scots, with their fre&s;h &s;upply newly come over the river, environed the&s;e three com|manders, and took them and &s;ome others of their troops pri&s;oners. General Le&s;ley treated the&s;e commanders nobly in the Scots camp, and afterwards gave them their liberty freely to return to the King's army.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In this engagement Cornet Potter, &s;on of Endymion Potter of the Bed-chamber, was &s;lain, and during the whole fight about 60 men more, as the Scots told us, after the ce&s;&s;ation of arms was agreed unto, for the Scots buried the dead; and afterwards they further told us, that mo&s;t of them that were killed lay about the works: how many of the Scots were &s;lain we know not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After this retreat the Lord Conway called a Council of War, and it was there re&s;olved, at twelve at night, that the whole army &s;hould retreat to Durham, hor&s;e, and foot, and train of artillery, and to quit Newca&s;tle.</Q></P>

<HEAD>ANCIENT CUSTOMS Which prevail in the COUNTY of NORTHUMBERLAND, WITH CONJECTURES THEREON.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="494">ANCIENT CUSTOMS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MANY ancient Cu&s;toms prevail in this County, the familiarity or outward in&s;ignificance of which occa&s;ion them to pa&s;s without much attention: but as they are the &s;tronge&s;t traditional memorials of antiquity, I thought them worth collecting, and pre&s;ent them to the Reader with &s;ome &s;hort Conjectures on their origin, and the hi&s;torical facts to which they have relation.</P>
<P>Mr Bryant's words are, <Q>We talk indeed of ancient times, and times of Antiquity; but that time is mo&s;t aged which has endured longe&s;t, and the&s;e are the mo&s;t ancient days in which we are our&s;elves conver&s;ant. We enjoy now an age of accumulated experience, and we are to make u&s;e of the helps which have been tran&s;mitted, to di&s;pel the mi&s;t which has preceded.</Q> Let|ters have afforded the accumulation; before their u&s;e, the di&s;&s;olution of every &s;tate was the di&s;&s;ipation of its &s;cience and wi&s;dom: arts and collective know|ledge were de&s;troyed with the empire in which they flouri&s;hed, and only a few &s;cattered fragments and di&s;tracted ruins remained to &s;ave them from total oblivion. By letters we po&s;&s;e&s;s the wi&s;dom of all quarters of the earth; times which have preceded their u&s;e left us chiefly traditional fragments, &s;cattered abroad in national cu&s;toms, and provincial names and phra&s;es.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this Collection I &s;hall remark whatever Mr Bourne, in his "Popular Antiquities," has noticed, with &s;ome of the illucidations and judi|cious con&s;tructions given by his late Editor, the Rev. Mr John Brand.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BABBA.</HEAD>
<P>The common and mo&s;t tender appellation of an infant is <HI>Babba.</HI> This name Mr Bryant, in his Analy&s;is of ancient Mythology, &s;ays, is derived from the exclamation made by the congregation during the ceremony of purification, by pa&s;&s;ing infants through the fire of Molock. Fire wor&s;hip was u&s;ed in this country, and in the Druidical rites &s;uch ceremony might be retained; for they held many cu&s;toms &s;o &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Hebrews, that it &s;trengthens the idea greatly they were communicated by the Phoenecians, or introduced from Germany, where the Amonians mo&s;t certainly were well known. The Saxons al&s;o introduced their cu&s;toms; they were wor&s;hippers of fire, and might hold &s;uch office of purification.</P>

<HEAD>GIFTS to INFANTS.</HEAD>
<P>Children when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;t &s;ent abroad in the arms of the nur&s;e to vi&s;it a neigh|bour, are pre&s;ented with an egg, &s;alt, and fine bread. The egg was a &s;acred emblem, and &s;eems a gift well adapted to infancy. Mr Bryant &s;ays, <Q>An egg, containing in it the elements of life, was thought no improper emblem of the ark, in which were pre&s;erved the rudiments of the future world: hence in the Dionu&s;iaca, and in other my&s;teries, one part of the nocturnal ceremony con&s;i&s;ted in the con&s;ecration of an egg. By this, as we are in|formed by Porphyry, was &s;ignified the world. It &s;eems to have been a favourite &s;ymbol, and very ancient, and we find it adopted among many nations. It was &s;aid by the Per&s;ians of Oroma&s;des, that he formed mankind and inclo&s;ed them in an egg.</Q> Cakes and Salt were u&s;ed in religious rites by the ancients: The Jews probably adopted their appropriation from the Egyptians; <Q>And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it &s;hall be unleavened cakes of fine flour, &amp;c. <BIBL>Lev. ii. 4.</BIBL></Q> <Q>With all thine offerings thou &s;halt offer &s;alt. <BIBL>Ibid. 13.</BIBL></Q> There was a cu&s;tom in the Romi&s;h church of making a cake in honour of the Holy Virgin's time of child-birth, which was condemned by a canon in the Council of Trullus.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p.

<HEAD>DOUBLING the THUMB.</HEAD>
<P>Children, to avoid approaching danger, are taught to double the thumb within the hand. This was much practi&s;ed whil&s;t the terrors of witchcraft remained; and even in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, much of tho&s;e unhappy prejudices po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the minds of the vulgar. It was a cu&s;tom to fold the thumbs of dead per&s;ons within the hand, to prevent the power of evil &s;pirits over the decea&s;ed; the thumb in that po&s;ition forming the &s;imilitude of the character in the Hebrew Alphabet, which is commonly u&s;ed to denote the name of God.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>NEW YEAR's DAY.</HEAD>
<P>The celebration of New Year's Day is pre&s;erved in this country as a rural fe&s;tival. Gifts are made to children, &s;ervants, and dependants, called New Year's Gifts. Mr Bourne quotes what Stillingfleet &s;ays, <Q>That among the Saxons of the northern nations, the fea&s;t of the New Year was ob&s;erved with more than ordinary jollity;</Q> and, from Ho&s;pinian, &s;ays, <Q>It was an ancient cu&s;tom of the Heathens, and afterwards practi&s;ed by the Chri&s;|tians.</Q> Servants were exempt from their labour, and partook of the fea&s;t and rural &s;ports with their ma&s;ters: they were pre&s;ented with tokens of appro|bation and favour. On certain fe&s;tivals, the Romans gave pieces of money to travellers and &s;trangers who were pre&s;ent at the &s;acrifice. On our day of fe&s;tivity, mirth is excited by a ru&s;tic ma&s;querading and playing tricks in di&s;|gui&s;e: the hide of the ox &s;lain for the winter cheer, is often put on, and the
<PB N="5" REF="496">
per&s;on thus attired, attempts to &s;hew the character of the devil, by every hor|rible device in his power. All the winter &s;ports &s;eem to expre&s;s a &s;trong opi|nion of the ancients, that Genii of very contrary natures prevailed on earth, that the one was con&s;tantly concomitant to light as the other was to dark|ne&s;s; and this image of the devil, which is frequently permitted to expel the inhabitants and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e, is typical of the power of the evil genius, in the &s;ea&s;on when the &s;un is longe&s;t ab&s;ent from our hemi&s;phere. This corre&s;ponds with the lamentation u&s;ed by tho&s;e who held the Elu&s;inian my&s;teries, and mourned for Adonis. It is very difficult to make any probable determination to what people we owe the&s;e cu&s;toms. In the Roman Saturnalia and Sigillaria, this kind of frolicking was practi&s;ed. Among the ob&s;ervations made by Mr Brand on Bourne's XIV Chap. he remarks, that there was an ancient cu&s;tom for young women to go about with a waffail bowl, that is, "a bowl of &s;piced ale," on New Year's Eve, with &s;ome &s;ort of ver&s;es that were &s;ung by them in going from door to door. Waffail is derived from the Anglo Sax. <GAP DESC="foreign"> that is, "Be in health."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>TWELFTH DAY.</HEAD>
<P>The twelfth day after the day of our Saviour's birth is attended with great fe&s;tivity. There are diver&s;ions u&s;ed in the &s;outhern parts of England, which have not reached this northern county. The mirth of the day here con&s;i&s;ts of fea&s;ting and a &s;ocial intercour&s;e between neighbouring families. Mr Brand makes a happy quotation from Collier's Eccl. Hi&s;t. vol. I. p. 163, in his ob&s;er|vations on Bourne's Chap. XVII. <Q>In the days of King Aelfrid a law was made with relation to the holydays, by virtue of which the 12 days after the nativity of our Saviour were made fe&s;tivals.</Q> So much as the&s;e fea&s;ts have been decried, I cannot &s;ee them in the de&s;picable light many modern authors have been plea&s;ed to place them. They were the occa&s;ion of gathering neigh|bours together, in good humour with each other, and the means of keeping them on terms of intimacy: friend&s;hip and benevolence were thereby increa&s;ed, and good offices multiplied: public matters at &s;uch times were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and amicably determined; and tho&s;e happy effects re&s;ulted which tended not only to the advantage of the individual, but to the good of &s;ociety at large. This age is refined into in&s;ipidity: few of the old ho&s;pitable days return: &s;ociability is &s;ickened into unmeaning ceremony. In ancient times the bard was brought to the fe&s;tive hall, to rehear&s;e the Excellencies of our ance&s;tors, to fire the brea&s;t with emulation, to in&s;pire noble and bounteous &s;entiments, and lift us, through example, into an adoption of the character of tho&s;e heroes and men of honour from whom we were de&s;cended: then it was the genial &s;pirit was rou&s;ed, and benevolence prevailed. The name of friend&s;hip is retained in our language, and the real character is &s;omewhere &s;till found to exi&s;t; but it is chiefly in middle life; the great and opulent in general have little experience of it: each apparently &s;eparates him&s;elf from community, and is involved in his own circle. The di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;ticks, which in former days pur|cha&s;ed a man fortune and fame, are become intrin&s;ic trifles, with which he
<PB N="6" REF="497">
may amu&s;e him&s;elf, but purcha&s;e little patronage: the vice is contaminating, it is creeping into the vitals of lower life, and where the in&s;ipidity will end is beyond modern magic to divine. What would be the con&s;equence, &s;hould adver&s;e ages ever bring on exigences of &s;tate? The old popular influence of the great no longer exi&s;ting! the di&s;tances between ranks of men &s;till extend|ing their &s;eparation! The celebrated fable points out the politics which would prevail with the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of men, <Q>If we are only to be regarded for &s;ervility, it is indifferent to us to whom we are &s;ervants.</Q> There is nothing keeps this part of the &s;tate within rule, but the fear of &s;till wor&s;ning the condition.</P>

<HEAD>BLACK MAILE PAYMENT.</HEAD>
<P>This cu&s;tomary collection of money, corn, and cattle, was taken away in con&s;equence of the acce&s;&s;ion of King James I. There was a law indeed made in the 43d year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to re&s;train the Black Maile Payment, and correct the enormities from whence it aro&s;e; but whil&s;t the contentions between the nations continued it had little effect. This was a levy made within this county by the chieftains on the borders, for protections again&s;t the depredations made by the robbers and &s;poil-takers, afterwards called Mo&s;s Troopers. The receivers were in league with the banditti.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>HEAD PENCE PAYMENT.</HEAD>
<P>This was an exaction made by the Sheriff of Northumberland, amounting to 40l. or more, twice in &s;even years. It was received for an exemption from attendance at the Sheriff's torn; and thereupon the Lords of Manors held their leet, where the &s;uitors, for their greater convenience, were permitted to attend and make what in the law books is called their <HI>Suit Royal.</HI> This exaction was totally &s;urpre&s;&s;ed by the Statute made in the 23d year of King Hen. VI. c. 7.</P>
<P>I have noticed the&s;e two ob&s;olete cu&s;toms, becau&s;e not only their names, but al&s;o &s;ome memorials of them remain on the borders, and in the moun|tainous parts of the county.</P>

<HEAD>CANDLEMAS DAY.</HEAD>
<P>It is little noted in this county, but by name. Several religious rites were made peculiar to it in the Romi&s;h church. In the quotation of St Gregory's Letter, in the notes to p. 27 in the &s;econd volume of the work, a rea&s;on is given for not aboli&s;hing the Pagan ceremonies, in countries where conver&s;ion was taking place; but it was commanded to adapt them to chri&s;tian ceremo|nies: and this &s;eems to carry with it a &s;trong rea&s;on for the &s;imilarity there was in many of the ceremonies of the chri&s;tian church in the fir&s;t ages and the Pagan rites.

Bacon's Reliques of Rome, fo. 164, makes a quotation which informs us, that the Romans, in the &s;ervice of their God Mars, and his mother Februa, made proce&s;&s;ions in the city of Rome with lighted torches; the remains of which cu&s;tom &s;till exi&s;ting with the vulgar in the time of Pope Sergius: he com|manded that it &s;hould be converted into an holy office of the chri&s;tian church, and that the congregation on the &s;ame day made their approach to the high altar with lighted tapers, in honour of the Holy Virgin. Tho&s;e who &s;igh for the &s;anctity of the church in &s;uch reviews of her ceremonies, mu&s;t con&s;ider this was done to conciliate the minds of tho&s;e long u&s;ed in &s;uch &s;pectacles and &s;olemn &s;hews; and that an au&s;terity which &s;hould at once have aboli&s;hed &s;uch acts, to which almo&s;t every mind was prejudiced, would have greatly re|tarded, if not totally prevented the progre&s;s of conver&s;ion.</P>

<P>It is not yet pointed out when or where this had its ri&s;e. It is a fa&s;t kept by women de&s;irous of dreaming of their lovers, and thence to derive pro|pitious indications touching wedlock.

<HEAD>VALENTINE DAY</HEAD>
<P>is an anniver&s;ary day of divination by lots. It is a common &s;aying, that birds on this day choo&s;e their mates. It may have relation to &s;ome dome&s;tic birds, and al&s;o rooks and pigeons. The cu&s;tom now is, that the names of young people are wrote on &s;crols of paper, and each draws one, confident that marriages are made in heaven, and in full hope the lot of life will be pointed out. What particular attention the allotted &s;wain in former days was obliged to pay the fair one, to who&s;e hands his name had fallen, I have not di&s;covered. Mr Brand, in his ob&s;ervations on Bourne's XXth chap. quotes a pa&s;&s;age in More&s;in to this purpo&s;e: <Q>That at this fe&s;tival, the men u&s;ed to make the women pre&s;ents, as upon another occa&s;ion the women u&s;ed to do to the men; but that in Scotland on this day pre&s;ents were reciprocal.</Q> Mr Pen|nant &s;peaks of this cu&s;tom in Scotland, by which young people try progno&s;ti|cations of their future fortunes in the nuptial &s;tate. The fir&s;t inventor of this cu&s;tom mu&s;t have been &s;ome benevolent female, who &s;tudied to encourage the intercour&s;e of the &s;exes; for by &s;uch means intimacies might ari&s;e, productive of love and marriage engagements: or otherwi&s;e the fir&s;t de&s;ign of tho&s;e lots was, that tho&s;e who &s;hared in the dances and diver&s;ions, might have their proper partners a&s;&s;igned, without hazarding the confu&s;ion and di&s;plea&s;ure which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e in the liberty of choice.</P>
<P>There was a religious &s;ect of Valentinians, but I find no ceremony u&s;ed by them or tenet they embraced, which could have any relation to the&s;e cu&s;toms.</P>

<HEAD>SHROVE TIDE.</HEAD>
<P>It is particularly ob&s;erved. Shrove is derived from <HI>Shrive,</HI> confe&s;&s;ion; a preparation enjoined in the Romi&s;h church, previous to the duties of Lent. It was particularly pre&s;cribed, that all offences &s;hould be mutually forgiven, and reconciliation take place, before they entered upon the &s;olemnities of Lent; and this was con&s;equently a day of mutual intercour&s;e and amity. In &s;everal ancient Roman Catholic families, the kitchen is opened, and every neighbour and pa&s;&s;enger is permitted to enter and fry a pancake, for which the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion is made ready. This &s;eems to be derived from a cu&s;tom in the refectory of religious hou&s;es, where the table was &s;pread on this day for all pilgrims, travellers, and vi&s;itants. In Newca&s;tle, Durham, and other places, the great bell of the church is tolled, the &s;ervants have holyday, and whoever partakes of the pancakes of the day mu&s;t fry them; a circum&s;tance which occa&s;ions high kitchen mirth. In the keeping of the vigils of all &s;olemn days, the ceremony began at noon. The ringing of the great bell at noon was a &s;ignal to clear the larder of fle&s;h meat, from which time its u&s;e was prohibited. In Mr Brand's Appendix to Bourne's Pop. Antiq. he &s;ays, <Q>A kind of pan|cake fea&s;t preceding Lent was u&s;ed in the Greek church, from whence probably we have borrowed it.</Q> One of the chief diver&s;ions of the day is fighting of cocks. More&s;in &s;ays this was derived from the Athenians, who exhibited cock fightings on one day in each year, an in&s;titution of The|mi&s;tockley; and that tho&s;e of the Romi&s;h church derived the cu&s;tom on this day from thence. The inference is ridiculous. It was a general holyday, and this was one of the vulgar di&s;&s;ipations, no otherwi&s;e peculiar to the &s;ea&s;on, than that the animal was in good feather at this time of the year, and in condition for the greate&s;t exertion of powers.</P>

<P>The name only remains, the peculiar cu&s;toms are forgotten. Penitents expre&s;&s;ed their humiliation by &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes. Fuller in his Church Hi&s;t. p. 222, mentions a cu&s;tom <Q>Of giving a&s;hes on A&s;h Wedne&s;day, to put in remembrance every chri&s;tian man in the beginning of Lent and Pennance, that he is but a&s;hes and earth, and thereto &s;hall return.</Q> In the prote&s;tant church the commination or &s;ervice contains a public rehear&s;al of tho&s;e cur&s;es which we find denounced in the &s;criptures, and which, with an impious arro|gance, we interlard with an amen; (not with a petition for ever&s;ion) a&s;&s;uming a right of denunciation and judgment, when humiliation, contrition, and tears would better befit the congregation in the rehear&s;al of the very cur&s;es by which the mo&s;t of them probably &s;tand condemned.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="500">
from the &s;everities of the Romi&s;h church in the early ages, at this period in Lent, in their ab&s;tinence and mortification u&s;ing &s;uch food. This was called Pa&s;&s;ion Sunday; and Mr Brand quotes Mar&s;hall on the Saxon Go&s;pels, vol. I. p. 536, where it is &s;aid, Care or Carr Sunday was not unknown to the Engli&s;h in his time. Mr Brand adds, It was u&s;ual to give away beans in the dole at funerals, both with the Heathen and the people of the Romi&s;h church. They are u&s;ed as a kind of mourning dole on this day. Era&s;mus mentions an ob&s;ervation of Pliny's, concerning Pythagoras's Interdiction of the u&s;e of Beans, "that they contain the &s;ouls of the dead." Thence they were u&s;ed in the Parentalia. Plutarch held, that pul&s;e was of the highe&s;t efficacy for in|voking the manes. The adoption by Chri&s;tians can only be reconciled by the preceding arguments touching Heathen rites. The modern Greeks carry in funeral proce&s;&s;ions parboiled wheat.</P>

<HEAD>PALM SUNDAY.</HEAD>
<P>On this day is &s;till retained the ancient u&s;age of dre&s;&s;ing windows with ever-greens, &amp;c. in commemoration of our Saviour's entry into Jeru&s;alem. It was the cu&s;tom of the ancient Chri&s;tian church to repre&s;ent, by &s;olemn &s;hews, even the mo&s;t tremendous occurrences in the hi&s;tory of our Saviour &mdash;a proce&s;&s;ion with palms was u&s;ed. In this country the buds of the &s;augh, which is one of the earlie&s;t marks of vegetation the trees of the climate &s;hew, are gathered and adopted for branches of palm. Mr Bourne &s;ays, the branch of palm was u&s;ed in the country near Jeru&s;alem as an emblem of victory. Our adoption of the &s;augh buds may ari&s;e from their being the fir&s;t bloom the woods wear after winter is &s;ubdued, and might be u&s;ed al&s;o typically, from their bearing te&s;timony of renovation, as a &s;acred emblem of victory over death.</P>

<HEAD>EASTER DAY</HEAD>
<P>is attended with &s;everal &s;ingular cu&s;toms. The people ri&s;e before the &s;un, in hopes to &s;ee the great luminary a&s;cend the horizon, dancing for joy. This has been an innocent artifice to draw forth the vulgar to early devotion; and what could be more powerfully typical and figurative to ignorant minds that conceive few images of the re&s;urrection of our Lord, than that of a glo|rious and re&s;plendent &s;un, ri&s;ing from a gilded horizon, di&s;pelling every gloom and &s;hade, and di&s;pen&s;ing light, beauty, and joy over the face of the earth. It was a &s;ea&s;on and a &s;pectacle, under the immediate impre&s;&s;ions of which, well adapted and pathetic exhortations would take a deep root. The Druids and Saxons both had made it a chief object of wor&s;hip, and the time of &s;un ri&s;ing the chief &s;ea&s;on for their religious rites and adorations; of the&s;e, &s;trong prejudices would remain with the vulgar. Bourne &s;ays, the &s;alutation of the ea&s;tern church on this day was, "The Lord is ri&s;en," and the u&s;ual an&s;wer was, "The Lord is ri&s;en indeed;" and no doubt they were peculiar to the morning.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="501">The children have dyed and gilded eggs given them, which are called <HI>Pa&s;te Eggs,</HI> a &s;uppo&s;ed corruption of <HI>Pa&s;che Eggs.</HI> Eggs were held by the Egyptians as a &s;acred emblem of the renovation of mankind after the deluge. The Jews adopted it to &s;uit the circum&s;tances of their hi&s;tory, as a type of their depar|ture from the land of Egypt; and it was u&s;ed in the Fea&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;over as part of the furniture of the table with the pa&s;chal lamb. The Chri&s;tians have certainly u&s;ed it on this day, as retaining the elements of future life, for an emblem of the re&s;urrection. Mr Brand has many well cho&s;en quotations on this &s;ubject, among which is a prayer extracted from the ritual of Pope Paul the Vth, made for the u&s;e of England, Ireland, and Scotland.</P>
<P><Q>Ble&s;s, O Lord, we be&s;eech thee, this thy creature of eggs, that it may become a whole&s;ome &s;u&s;tenance to thy faithful &s;ervants, eating it in thank|fulne&s;s to thee, <HI>on account of the re&s;urrection</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who with thee,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>He quotes from Dr Chandler's Travels in A&s;ia Minor a pa&s;&s;age, in which it appears, tho&s;e of the Greek church on this day pre&s;ented coloured eggs. In Ru&s;&s;ia there is the like cu&s;tom, which he &s;hews in two quotations, one from the Abb&egrave; d' Auteroche, in his Journey to Siberia, and the other from Hakluyt's Voyage 1589. But from all the quotations no determination is drawn why the <HI>painted Eggs</HI> were u&s;ed on this day peculiarly, and e&s;pecially being no part of the day's repa&s;t. The field of conjecture is open and at large to every one. It &s;eems as if the Egg was thus decorated for a religious trophy after the days of mortification and ab&s;tinence were over, and fe&s;tivity had taken place; and as an emblem of the renovation of life, certified to us by the re&s;urrection from the regions of death and the grave.</P>
<P>Mr Brand, p. 252, gives us the following note: <Q><HI>Era&s;mus &s;peaking of the proverb,</HI> Mea e&s;t Pila, <HI>that is,</HI> I have got the ball, <HI>tells us that it &s;ignifies</HI> I have obtained the victory, I am ma&s;ter of my wi&s;hes.</Q> The Romani&s;ts certainly erected a &s;tandard on Ea&s;ter Day in token of our Lord's victory; but it would perhaps be indulging fancy too far to &s;uppo&s;e that the Bi&s;hops and Governors of churches, who u&s;ed to conde&s;cend to play at <HI>hand ball</HI> at this time, did it in a my&s;tical way, and with reference to the triumphal joy of the &s;ea&s;on. Cer|tain it is, however, that many of their cu&s;toms and &s;uper&s;titions are founded on &s;till more trivial circum&s;tances than even this imaginary analogy.</P>
<P>It was an ancient cu&s;tom for the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriff of New|ca&s;tle, accompanied with great numbers of the Burge&s;&s;es to go every year at the fea&s;ts of Ea&s;ter and Whit&s;untide to the Forth, the little mall of the town, with the maces, &s;word, and cap of maintenance carried before them. The young people of the town &s;till a&s;&s;emble there, at this &s;ea&s;on particularly, play at hand ball, dance, &amp;c. but are no longer countenanced in their innocent fe&s;tivity by the pre&s;ence of their Governors, who no doubt in ancient times
<PB N="11" REF="502">
u&s;ed to unbend the brow of authority, and partake with their happy and con|tented people, the puerile plea&s;ures of the fe&s;tive &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o u&s;ual among the &s;ports of the day to have foot cour&s;es, &amp;c. the prize being a <HI>tan&s;ey cake.</HI> It has been alledged, that the u&s;e of <HI>tan&s;ey</HI> was adopted from the Jewi&s;h me&s;s of bitter herbs at this &s;ea&s;on. A di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this practice of the Jews would be too tedious in this place, and articles of mortification &s;eem not to corre&s;pond with the univer&s;al fe&s;tivity of the time; I rather conceive that the prizes were the ancient &s;weet bread, concerning the u&s;e of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to make &s;ome remarks in the &s;equel, and that <HI>tan&s;ey</HI> was u&s;ed for its flavour and &s;alubrity only.</P>
<P>Mr Brand quotes Durand Lib. 6. c. 86. 9. for a very &s;ingular and unrea&s;on|able cu&s;tom, <Q>That on Ea&s;ter Day wives u&s;ed to beat their hu&s;bands, and on the day following hu&s;bands their wives:" and he adds, "There is a cu&s;tom &s;till retained at the city of Durham on the&s;e holydays, on one day the men take off the women's &s;hoes, which are only to be redeemed by a pre&s;ent, and on another day the women take off the men's in like manner.</Q> This cu&s;tom is not a peculiarity of the city of Durham only, but extends into other parts of that county, as well as Northumberland. As it &s;eems to be the remains of &s;ome religious ceremony, if peculiar to the cathedral it would pro|bably travel with the See from Lindisfarn by Che&s;ter to Durham, and its re|mains would be found &s;cattered through this pa&s;&s;age. In Lanca&s;hire the cu&s;|tom of the day is to lift the pa&s;&s;enger from the ground: this &s;hews of it&s;elf of what it is emblematical. But our cu&s;tom leaves us wide and indeterminate conjectures. In the cathedral of Durham there was a cu&s;tom on Good Friday for the Monks to approach the high altar, then decorated with all the &s;olemn emblems of that tremendous day, on their knees, being bare footed. On Ea&s;ter Day they made a &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, when all the &s;pectators pulled off their &s;hoes, as treading on holy ground. King Canute approached the &s;hrine of St. Cuthbert from Garmond&s;way, the di&s;tance of five miles, with all his re|tinue and attendants bare-footed; when he gave great territories and donations to that church. Lel. Col. vol. I. p. 331. The&s;e are the mo&s;t memorable circum|&s;tances I have been able to collect. Preparatory to the pa&s;&s;over, our Saviour wa&s;hed the feet of the Di&s;ciples; after which he gave them this ordonance: "For I have given you an example, that you &s;hould do as I have done to you." The Monks of Durham are &s;aid to have wa&s;hed the feet of the poor, within the cloi&s;ter, in commemoration of our Saviour's act. In the ages immediately &s;uc|ceeding the conver&s;ion of the Britons, an inveterate hatred and contempt was &s;hewn to all Jews, who by &s;hipwreck or other ca&s;ualty came among them; even to a greater bitterne&s;s the aver&s;ion was carried, than again&s;t the uncon|verted Heathen. The order of the pa&s;&s;over ceremonies, as &s;et forth in the 12th chapter of Exodus, enjoins the Jews to have their &s;hoes upon their feet: per|haps in contradi&s;tinction, or in reproach of the Jews, the &s;hoes of pa&s;&s;engers are pulled off.</P>

<P>I intimated in the preceding pages, an intention of remarking the <HI>Sweet Bread</HI> u&s;ed in religious rites. Small loaves of bread, peculiar in their form, being long and &s;harp at both ends, are called Buns. This name takes place where old religious ceremonies have been &s;olemnized, derived from the con&s;ecrated &s;weet bread, which was offered on high fe&s;tivals. It is of the highe&s;t antiquity; according to Mr Bryant, <Q>the offerings which people in ancient times u&s;ed to pre&s;ent to the Gods, were generally purcha&s;ed at the entrance of the temple; e&s;pecially every &s;pecies of con&s;ecrated bread, which was denominated accord|ingly.

The prophet Jeremiah takes notice of this kind of offering, when he is &s;peaking of the Jewi&s;h women at Pathros in Egypt, and of their ba&s;e idolatry; in all which their hu&s;bands had encouraged them; the women in their expo&s;tulation upon his rebuke tell him, <HI>Did we make her cakes to wor&s;hip her?</HI> &amp;c.

<HEAD>MAY-DAY.</HEAD>
<P>It &s;till retains &s;ome of its ancient &s;ports. The young people of both &s;exes go out early in the morning of the 1&s;t day of May, to gather the flowering thorns and the dew of the gra&s;s, which they bring home with mu&s;ic and acclamations; and having dre&s;&s;ed a poll on the town-green with garlands, dance around it. The dew was con&s;idered as a grand co&s;metick, and pre|&s;erved the face from wrinkles, blotches, and the traces of old age: the hap|pie&s;t gift Flora could be&s;tow on her votaries. It &s;eems from the&s;e remains, that this fe&s;tival was introduced by the Romans, who ob&s;erved it in honour of Flora. What particular rites originally attended it with that people we &s;hall not enquire: at pre&s;ent it is celebrated only with mirth, innocence, and love. The Druids, who were the prie&s;ts of the God of nature, and celebrated every remarkable period in the change of &s;ea&s;ons, left a memorial of their reli|gious rites on this day, very different from tho&s;e in&s;tituted in honour of the notorious divinity Flora; that is, a Bel-tein rural &s;acrifice. It is to be traced in the mountainous and uncultivated parts of Cumberland, among the Cheviots, and in many parts of Scotland. Mr Pennant gives a particular de&s;cription in his Tour in Scotland: <Q>On the fir&s;t of May, in the Highlands of Scotland, the herd&s;men of every village hold their Beltein: they cut a &s;quare trench in the ground, leaving the turf in the middle: on that they make a fire of wood, on which they dre&s;s a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal, and milk, and bring, be&s;ides the ingredients of the caudle, plenty of beer and whi&s;ky; for each of the company mu&s;t contribute &s;omething. The rites begin with &s;pilling &s;ome of the caudle on the ground, by way of liba|tion;
<PB N="14" REF="505">
on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which are rai&s;ed nine &s;quare knobs, each dedicated to &s;ome particular being, the &s;uppo&s;ed pre|&s;erver of their flocks and herds, or to &s;ome particular animal, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">al de&s;troyer of them; each per&s;on then turns his face to the fire, breaks off a knob, and flinging it over his &s;houlder, &s;ays, this I give to thee, pre&s;erve thou my hor&s;es; this to thee, pre&s;erve thou my &s;heep, and &s;o on. After that they u&s;e the &s;ame ceremony to the noxious animals: this I give to thee, O fox! &s;pare thou my lambs: this to thee, O hooded crow! this to thee, eagle! when the ceremony is over, they dine on the caudle,</Q> &amp;c.</P>

Here it was that people, if they &s;aw cau&s;e, depo&s;ed or puni&s;hed their Governors, their Barons, their Kings. The garland or crown when hung on the top of the <HI>May</HI> or Pole, was the great &s;ignal for convening the people. This was one of the anciente&s;t cu&s;toms, which from the remote&s;t ages, has been by repetition from year to year perpetuated.</Q> <Q>It was con&s;idered as the boundary day that divided the confines of winter and &s;ummer, allu&s;ively to which, there was in&s;tituted a &s;portful war between two parties; the one in defence of the continuance of winter, the other for bringing in the &s;ummer. The youth were divided into troops, the one in winter livery, the other in the gay habit of the &s;pring. The mock battle was always fought booty, the &s;pring was &s;ure to obtain the victory, which they celebrated by carrying triumphally green branches with May flowers, proclaiming and &s;inging the &s;ong of joy, of which the burthen was in the&s;e or equivalent terms.</Q></P>

<HEAD>MIDSUMMER.</HEAD>
<P>The ceremonies of the eve and day of Mid&s;ummer were various, and worthy attention. In all the&s;e fe&s;tivals, it was the cu&s;tom to keep the wake, as it was called, or watch, 'till after midnight, and to begin the &s;ports and ceremonies of the day in the fir&s;t hour of the morning.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tice was the grand fe&s;tival and jubilee of the Druids, and all tho&s;e who retained any of the Amonian rites, of which we trace &s;everal in the religious ceremonies of the Saxons. This day was celebrated with peculiar magnificence and &s;olemnity, when the adored luminary was at his greate&s;t altitude. It has been alledged by &s;ome, that the Elu&s;inian rites, in celebrating the return of Pro&s;erpine, gave part of the ceremony of this day; and that the u&s;e of garlands is derived from the cu&s;tom of the initiated in the Elu&s;inian mi&s;teries, being crowned with flowers.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ual to rai&s;e fires on the tops of high hills and in the villages, and &s;port and dance around them; this is of very remote antiquity, and the fir&s;t cau&s;e lo&s;t in the di&s;tance of time. Many rea&s;ons have been a&s;&s;igned in different periods. Bourne quotes a pa&s;&s;age of Durand to the following purport, <Q>In ancient times the dragons, being incited to lu&s;t through the heat of the &s;ea&s;on, did frequently as they flew through the air, &s;pertmatize in the wells and fountains; by this means the water became infected, and the air pol|luted, &s;o that whoever drank the waters was either tormented with a grievous di&s;temper, or lo&s;t his life. As &s;oon as the phy&s;icians perceived this, they ordered fires to be made every where about the wells and fountains, and tho&s;e things which occa&s;ioned the noi&s;ome&s;t &s;mell to be burnt, knowing that thereby the dragons would be driven away: and fora&s;much as this cu&s;|tom was ob&s;erved about the time we now celebrate St John Bapti&s;t's fea&s;t, it is therefore &s;till ob&s;erved among &s;ome people.</Q> In this enigmatical and mi&s;terious account we plainly trace, the fires were originally kindled for &s;acred rites and &s;acrifice, in order to avert the horrors of pe&s;tilence, which in early ages frequently attended the advancing heat of &s;ummer, in a country covered with fore&s;ts and &s;wamps, who&s;e re&s;piration and exhalations brought on various di&s;tempers, of which Epilep&s;ies was one of the mo&s;t general; to prevent which, the darkne&s;s of tho&s;e times had received few di&s;coveries of medi|cine. In Scotland they u&s;ed to run about the mountains and higher grounds with lighted torches, like the Sicilian women of old in &s;carch of Pro&s;erpine.&mdash; The prophete&s;&s;es in Mona, at the approach of the Romans, ran about with di&s;hevelled hair in a frantic mode with lighted torches, performing various rites to execrate the enemy. It was a cu&s;tom not many years ago in this county, for the villagers to run with burning firebrands round their fields, and then in a forcible manner taking the a&s;hes from &s;ome neighbouring fire, they u&s;ed to exclaim, <HI>"We have won the flower (alias flour) of the wake."</HI> More&s;in conceives we trace the ancient <HI>Cerealia</HI> in this ceremony. It is not
<PB N="16" REF="507">
to be wondered, that the Druid rites &s;hould in cour&s;e of time be mixed with the Roman. Mr Borlace, &s;peaking of this cu&s;tom in Wales, &s;ays, <Q>He takes it to be the remains of the Druid &s;uper&s;tition.</Q> More&s;in is of opinion, the cu&s;tom of leaping over the fires is a ve&s;tige of the ordeal, and tho&s;e perform|ing the&s;e feats were &s;hewing tokens of innocence and virtue, by being neither burnt or &s;ullied. The act of leaping through the flames was certainly a reli|gious one, and was meant as a kind of purification, and not merely a &s;port and di&s;play of agility. Mr Pennant mentions another remarkable cu&s;tom in Scotland, of which he was an eye witne&s;s: they take the new baptized infant, and wave it three or four times gently over a flame, &s;aying thrice, <HI>"Let the fire con&s;ume thee now or never:"</HI> this &s;eems to be the direct act of purification in pa&s;&s;ing the fire of Molock. Like other heatheni&s;h cu&s;toms appropriated to fe&s;tivals of the chri&s;tian church, the&s;e are adopted on the day of St John, or rather u&s;ed on the &s;ame anniver&s;ary, and the name of that Saint a&s;&s;umed to give them new &s;anctity. Mr Brand quotes &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages from <HI>Gebelin's Alle|gories Orientales:</HI> <Q>Can one (&s;ays he) overlook here the St John fires, kindled about midnight, on the very moment of the &s;ol&s;tice, by the greate&s;t part both of ancient and modern nations? A religious ceremony, which goes backward thus to the mo&s;t remote antiquity, and which was ob&s;erved for the pro&s;perity of States, and to di&s;pel every kind of evil.</Q> Divinations were al&s;o u&s;ed on the vigil of this day: <Q>Men and women were accu&s;tomed to gather together in the evening by the &s;ea &s;ide, or in &s;ome certain hou&s;es, and there adorn a girl, who was her parent's fir&s;t begotten child, after the manner of a bride. Then they fea&s;ted, and leaped after the manner of bac|chanals, and danced and &s;houted as they were wont to do on their holidays; after this they poured into a narrow necked ve&s;&s;el, &s;ome of the &s;ea water, and put al&s;o into it certain things belonging to each of them; then, as if the devil gifted the girl with the faculty of telling future things, they would enquire with a loud voice, about the good or evil fortune that &s;hould attend them; upon this the girl would take out of the ve&s;&s;el the fir&s;t thing that came to hand, and &s;hew it and give it to the owner, who, upon receiving it, was &s;o fooli&s;h as to imagine him&s;elf wi&s;er, as to the good or evil fortune that &s;hould attend him.</Q> Bourne, p. 226.</P>
<P>Another cu&s;tom u&s;ed on this day, is to dre&s;s out &s;tools with a cu&s;hion of flowers. A lair of clay is placed on the &s;tool, and therein is &s;tuck, with great regularity, an arrangement of all kinds of flowers, &s;o clo&s;e as to form a beauti|ful cu&s;hion: the&s;e are exhibited at the doors of hou&s;es in the villages, and at the ends of &s;treets and cro&s;s lanes of larger towns, where the attendants beg money from pa&s;&s;engers, to enable them to have an evening fea&s;t and dancing. This cu&s;tom is evidently derived from the <HI>Ludi Compitalii</HI> of the Romans: this appellation was taken from the <HI>Compita</HI> or cro&s;s lanes, where they were in|&s;tituted and celebrated by the multitude a&s;&s;embled before the building of Rome. <HI>Servius Tullius</HI> revived this fe&s;tival after it had been neglected for many years. It was the fea&s;t of the <HI>Lares</HI> or hou&s;hold Gods, who pre&s;ided as
<PB N="17" REF="508">
well over hou&s;es as &s;treets. This mode of adorning the &s;eat or couch of the <HI>Lares</HI> was beautiful, and the idea of repo&s;ing them on aromatic flowers and beds of ro&s;es was excellent. The chief port of the ceremonies and &s;olemnities of this fea&s;t u&s;ed by the Romans, as we are told by the Poets and Hi&s;torians, was exhibiting the hou&s;hold Gods, crowning and adorning them with chaplets and garlands of flowers, and offering &s;acrifices up and down the &s;treets. The Briti&s;h remains of the ceremony are more refined&mdash;that of repo&s;ing them on tho&s;e delicious beds. Suetonius tells us, that Augu&s;tus ordered the <HI>Lares</HI> to be crowned twice a year. We are not told there was any cu&s;tom among the Romans, of &s;trangers or pa&s;&s;engers offering gifts. Our modern u&s;age of all the&s;e old cu&s;toms terminates in &s;eeking to gain money for a merry night.</P>

<P>After harve&s;t the Heathens are &s;aid to have &s;acrificed to the Deity Vacina or Vacuna, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to pre&s;ide over Re&s;t and Ea&s;e. It is now a cu&s;tom on the la&s;t day of reaping, to dre&s;s up an image of the corn, and bear it home in triumph, which is called the Kern (properly Corn) Baby. In &s;ome places I have &s;een an image apparelled in great finery, crowned with flowers, a &s;heaf of corn placed under her arm, and a &s;cycle in her hand, carried out of the village on the morning of the conclu&s;ive reaping day, with mu&s;ic and much clamour of the reapers into the field, where it &s;tands fixed on a poll all day, and when the reaping is done, is brought home in like manner: This they call the <HI>Harve&s;t Queen,</HI> and repre&s;ents the Roman Ceres. The &s;ervants having performed the mo&s;t valuable part of their labour, are entertained by their ma&s;ters, when all di&s;tinction is laid a&s;ide. This fea&s;t is called the Mell-Supper, at which there are dancing, ma&s;quing, and di&s;gui&s;ing, and all other kinds of rural mirth. The name of this &s;upper is derived from the rites of <HI>Ceres,</HI> when an offering of the fir&s;t-fruits was made; the word <HI>Melle</HI> being a provincial word, and &s;ignifies in this country <HI>mingled;</HI> implying that the cakes u&s;ed at this fe&s;tival are mingled or made of new corn, and that it is the fea&s;t of the fir&s;t mingling of flour of the new reaped wheat. The Romans held a &s;olemn day after harve&s;t, dedicated to Ceres and Ops, the accu&s;tomed victim a boar: but we cannot from any part of the above rural fea&s;t gather the lea&s;t Roman remains, &s;ave only the &s;ea&s;on and the image of the Godde&s;s. The re|joicing after harve&s;t may have an origin as high in antiquity as reaping it&s;elf: The fir&s;t in&s;tance we read of is in the 4th chapter of Gene&s;is, ver. 3, 4.</P>

It has had a more di&s;tant implication, and intended to keep up the wake, and drive away malevolent &s;pirits, and &s;pirits of darkne&s;s. The Druids held a &s;olemn fe&s;tival at this time, and fires were lighted to fill up the &s;pace between the la&s;t night and fir&s;t morn|ing of the year, that the evil genius might not prevail. The Elu&s;inian my&s;te|ries were typical of the renewing year; and the howlings and lamentations made in the hours of darkne&s;s for the lo&s;s of Adonis, were like our &s;olemn wake over the yule clog, which was to bani&s;h the &s;pirits of darkne&s;s whil&s;t the &s;un was in his deepe&s;t rece&s;s. In tho&s;e rites, the return of Adonis, or the &s;un, was repre&s;ented by the approach of a Prie&s;t with a lighted torch, thereby di&s;pelling the horrid darkne&s;s, in which the prevalency of the evil genius was de&s;cribed by horrid noi&s;es, and all the dreadful &s;pectacles ingenuity could de|vi&s;e, to &s;ecure the &s;uper&s;tition of the a&s;&s;embly. Among all nations there has appeared a prevalent &s;uper&s;tition touching good and evil &s;pirits, one &s;uperin|tending the hours of light, the others darkne&s;s; one the guides of man's recti|tude and virtues, the other his malevolence and vice.</P>
<P>On the word Yule or Gule, there have been innumerable controver&s;ies with the learned, from who&s;e arguments I am induced to believe it is a word de|rived from the old Briti&s;h language, and implies a Fe&s;tival; and thence that Yule Clog expre&s;&s;es the fe&s;tive fuel.</P>
