<HEAD>HESIOD: OR, THE RISE OF WOMAN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHAT antient times (tho&s;e times we fancy wi&s;e)</L>
<L>Have left on long record of Woman's ri&s;e,</L>
<L>What morals teach it, and what fables hide,</L>
<L>What author wrote it, how that author dy'd,</L>
<L>All the&s;e I &s;ing. In Greece they fram'd the tale</L>
<L>(In Greece, 'twas thought a Woman might be frail.)</L>
<L>Ye modern beauties! where the poet drew</L>
<L>His &s;ofte&s;t pencil, think he dreamt of you;</L>
<L>And warn'd by him, ye wanton pens, beware</L>
<L>How Heav'n's concern'd to vindicate the fair.</L>
<L>The ca&s;e was He&s;iod's; he the fable writ;</L>
<L>Some think with meaning, &s;ome with idle wit:</L>
<L>Perhaps 'tis either, as the ladies plea&s;e;</L>
<L>I wave the conte&s;t, and commence the lays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In days of yore, (no matter where or when,</L>
<L>'Twas ere the low creation &s;warm'd with men)</L>
<L>That one Prometheus, &s;prung of heav'nly birth,</L>
<L>(Our author's &s;ong can witne&s;s) liv'd on earth.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8">He carv'd the turf to mold a manly frame,</L>
<L>And &s;tole from Jove his animating flame.</L>
<L>The &s;ly contrivance o'er Olympus ran,</L>
<L>When thus the monarch of the &s;tars began.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh vers'd in arts! who&s;e daring thoughts a&s;pire</L>
<L>To kindle clay with never-dying fire!</L>
<L>Enjoy thy glory pa&s;t, that gift was thine;</L>
<L>The next thy creature meets, be fairly mine:</L>
<L>And &s;uch a gift, a vengeance &s;o de&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>As &s;uits the coun&s;el of a God to find;</L>
<L>A plea&s;ing bo&s;om-cheat, a &s;pecious ill,</L>
<L>Which felt thy cur&s;e, yet covet &s;till to feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He &s;aid, and Vulcan &s;trait the &s;ire commands,</L>
<L>To temper mortar with etherial hands;</L>
<L>In &s;uch a &s;hape to mold a ri&s;ing fair,</L>
<L>As virgin-godde&s;&s;es are proud to wear;</L>
<L>To make her eyes with diamond-water &s;hine,</L>
<L>And form her organs for a voice divine.</L>
<L>'Twas thus the &s;ire ordain'd; the pow'r obey'd;</L>
<L>And work'd, and wonder'd at the work he made;</L>
<L>The faire&s;t, &s;ofte&s;t, &s;weete&s;t frame beneath,</L>
<L>Now made to &s;eem, now more than &s;eem, to breathe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As Vulcan ends, the chearful Queen of Charms</L>
<L>Cla&s;p'd the new-panting creature in her arms;</L>
<L>From that embrace a fine complexion &s;pread,</L>
<L>Where mingled whitene&s;s glow'd with &s;ofter red.</L>
<L>Then in a ki&s;s &s;he breath'd her various arts,</L>
<L>Of trifling prettily with wounded hearts;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9">A mind for love, but &s;till a changing mind;</L>
<L>The li&s;p affected, and the glance de&s;ign'd;</L>
<L>The &s;weet confu&s;ing blu&s;h, the &s;ecret wink,</L>
<L>The gentle-&s;wimming walk, the courteous &s;ink,</L>
<L>The &s;tare for &s;trangene&s;s fit, for &s;corn the frown,</L>
<L>For decent yielding looks declining down,</L>
<L>The practis'd langui&s;h, where well-feign'd de&s;ire</L>
<L>Wou'd own its melting in a mutual fire;</L>
<L>Gay &s;miles to comfort; April &s;how'rs to move;</L>
<L>And all the nature, all the art, of love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Gold-&s;cepter'd Juno next exalts the fair;</L>
<L>Her touch endows her with imperious air,</L>
<L>Self-valuing fancy, highly-cre&s;ted pride,</L>
<L>Strong &s;ov'reign will, and &s;ome de&s;ire to chide:</L>
<L>For which, an eloquence, that aims to vex,</L>
<L>With native tropes of anger, arms the &s;ex.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Minerva (&s;kilful godde&s;s) train'd the maid</L>
<L>To twirl the &s;pindle by the twi&s;ting thread,</L>
<L>To fix the loom, in&s;truct the reeds to part,</L>
<L>Cro&s;s the long weft, and clo&s;e the web with art,</L>
<L>An u&s;eful gift; but what profu&s;e expence,</L>
<L>What world of fa&s;hions, took its ri&s;e from hence!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young Hermes next, a clo&s;e-contriving god,</L>
<L>Her brows encircled with his &s;erpent rod:</L>
<L>Then plots and fair excu&s;es, fill'd her brain,</L>
<L>The views of breaking am'rous vows for gain,</L>
<L>The price of favours; the de&s;igning arts</L>
<L>That aim at riches in contempt of hearts;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="10">And for a comfort in the marriage life,</L>
<L>The little, pilf'ring temper of a wi&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Full on the fair his beams Apollo flung,</L>
<L>And fond per&s;wa&s;ion tip'd her ea&s;y tongue;</L>
<L>He gave her words, where oily flatt'ry lays</L>
<L>The plea&s;ing colours of the art of prai&s;e;</L>
<L>And wit, to &s;candal exqui&s;itely prone,</L>
<L>Which frets another's &s;pleen to cure its own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho&s;e &s;acred virgins whom the bards revere,</L>
<L>Tun'd all her voice, and &s;hed a &s;weetne&s;s there,</L>
<L>To make her &s;en&s;e with double charms abound,</L>
<L>Or make her lively non&s;en&s;e plea&s;e by &s;ound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To dre&s;s the maid, the decent Graces brought</L>
<L>A robe in all the dies of beauty wrought,</L>
<L>And plac'd their boxes o'er a rich brocade</L>
<L>Where pictur'd Loves on ev'ry cover play'd;</L>
<L>Then &s;pread tho&s;e implements that Vulcan's art</L>
<L>Had fram'd to merit Cytherea's heart;</L>
<L>The wire to curl, the clo&s;e indented comb</L>
<L>To call the locks that lightly wander, home;</L>
<L>And chief, the mirrour, where the ravi&s;h'd maid</L>
<L>Beholds and loves her own reflected &s;hade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair Flora lent her &s;tores, the purpled Hours</L>
<L>Confin'd her tre&s;&s;es with a wreath of flow'rs;</L>
<L>Within the wreath aro&s;e a radiant crown;</L>
<L>A veil pellucid hung depending down;</L>
<L>Back roll'd her azure veil with &s;erpent fold,</L>
<L>The purfled border deck'd the floor with gold.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="11">Her robe (which clo&s;ely by the girdle brac't</L>
<L>Reveal'd the beauties of a &s;lender wa&s;te)</L>
<L>Flow'd to the feet; to copy Venus' air,</L>
<L>When Venus' &s;tatues have a robe to wear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The new-&s;prung creature fini&s;h'd thus for harms,</L>
<L>Adju&s;ts her habit, practi&s;es her charms,</L>
<L>With blu&s;hes glows, or &s;hines with lively &s;miles,</L>
<L>Confirms her will, or recollects her wiles:</L>
<L>Then con&s;cious of her worth, with ea&s;y pace</L>
<L>Glides by the gla&s;s, and turning views her face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A finer flax than what they wrought before,</L>
<L>Thro' time's deep cave the Si&s;ter Fates explore,</L>
<L>Then fix the loom, their fingers nimbly weave,</L>
<L>And thus their toil prophetic &s;ongs deceive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Flow from the rock, my flax! and &s;wiftly flow,</L>
<L>Pur&s;ue thy thread; the &s;pindle runs below.</L>
<L>A creature fond and changing, fair and vain,</L>
<L>The creature Woman, ri&s;es now to reign.</L>
<L>New beauty blooms, a beauty form'd to fly;</L>
<L>New love begins, a love produc'd to dye;</L>
<L>New parts di&s;tre&s;s the troubled &s;cenes of life,</L>
<L>The fondling mi&s;tre&s;s, and the ruling wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Men, born to labour, all with pains provide;</L>
<L>Women have time, to &s;acrifice to pride:</L>
<L>They want the care of man, their want they know,</L>
<L>And dre&s;s to plea&s;e with heart-alluring &s;how,</L>
<L>The &s;how prevailing, for the &s;way contend,</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OUR defects and follies are too often unknown to us; nay, they are &s;o far from being known to us, that they pa&s;s for demon&s;trations of our worth. This makes us ea&s;y in the mid&s;t of them, fond to &s;hew them, fond to improve in them, and to be e&s;teemed for them. Then it is that a thou&s;and unaccountable con|ceits, gay inventions, and extravagant actions mu&s;t af|ford us plea&s;ures, and di&s;play as to others in the colours which we our&s;elves take a fancy to glory in: and in|deed there is &s;omething &s;o amu&s;ing for the time in this &s;tate of vanity and ill-grounded &s;atisfaction, that even the wi&s;er world has cho&s;en an exalted word to de&s;cribe its enchantments, and called it THE PARADISE OF FOOLS. Perhaps the latter part of this reflection may &s;eem a fal&s;e thought to &s;ome, and bear another turn
<PB N="110" REF="113">than what I have given; but it is at pre&s;ent none of my bu&s;ine&s;s to look after it, who am going to confe&s;s that I have been lately among&s;t them in a vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Methought I was tran&s;ported to a hill, green, flowery, and of an ea&s;y a&s;cent. Upon the broad top of it re&s;ided &s;quint-eyed ERROR, and popular OPINION with many heads; two that dealt in &s;orcery, and were famous for bewitching people with the love of them&s;elves. To the&s;e repaired a multitude from every &s;ide, by two dif|ferent paths which lead towards each of them. Some who had the mo&s;t a&s;&s;uming air went directly of them|&s;elves to ERROR, without expecting a conductor; o|thers of a &s;ofter nature went fir&s;t to popular OPINION, from whence as &s;he influenced and engaged them with their own prai&s;es, &s;he delivered them over to his go|vernment.</P>
<P>When we had a&s;cended to an open part of the &s;um|mit where OPINION abode, we found her entertaining &s;everal who had arrived before us. Her voice was plea|&s;ing; &s;he breathed odours as &s;he &s;poke: &s;he &s;eemed to have a tongue for every one; every one thought he heard of &s;omething that was valuable in him&s;elf, and expected a paradi&s;e which &s;he promi&s;ed as the reward of his merit. Thus we were drawn to follow her, 'till &s;he &s;hould bring us where it was to be be&s;towed: and it was ob&s;ervable, that all the way we went, the com|pany was either prai&s;ing them&s;elves in their qualifica|tions, or one another for tho&s;e qualifications which they
<PB N="111" REF="114">took to be con&s;picuous in their own characters, or di&s;|prai&s;ing others for wanting theirs, or vying in the de|grees of them.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we approached a bower, at the entrance of which ERROR was &s;eated. The trees were thick wo|ven, and the place where he &s;at artfully contrived to darken him a little. He was di&s;gui&s;ed in a whiti&s;h robe, which he had put on, that he might appear to us with a nearer re&s;emblance to TRUTH: and as &s;he has a light whereby &s;he manife&s;ts the beauties of nature to the eyes of her adorers, &s;o he had provided him&s;elf with a magi|cal wand, that he might do &s;omething in imitation of it, and plea&s;e with delu&s;ions. This he li&s;ted &s;olemnly, and muttering to him&s;elf, bid the glories which he kept un|der enchantment to appear before us. Immediately we ca&s;t our eyes on that part of the &s;ky to which he pointed, and ob&s;erved a thin blue pro&s;pect, which cleared as mountains in a Summer morning when the mi&s;ts go off, and the palace of VANITY appeared to &s;ight.</P>
<P>The foundation hardly &s;eemed a foundation, but a &s;et of curling clouds, which it &s;tood upon by magical contrivance. The way by which we a&s;cended was paint|ed like a rainbow; and as we went the breeze that play|ed about us bewitched the &s;en&s;es. The walls were gild|ed all for &s;how; the lowe&s;t &s;et of pillars were of the &s;light fine Corinthian order, and the top of the build|ing being rounded, bore &s;o far the re&s;emblance of a bubble.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="115">At the gate the travellers neither met with a porter, nor waited 'till one &s;hould appear; every one thought his merits a &s;ufficient pa&s;&s;port, and pre&s;&s;ed forward. In the hall we met with &s;everal phantoms, that rov'd a|mong&s;t us, and rang'd the company according to their &s;entiments. There was decrea&s;ing HONOUR, that had nothing to &s;hew in but an old coat of his ance&s;tor's at|chievements: there was OSTENTATION, that made him&s;elf his own con&s;tant &s;ubject, and GALLANTRY strutting upon his tip-toes. At the upper end of the hall &s;tood a throne, who&s;e canopy glitter'd with all the riches that gayety could contrive to lavi&s;h on it; and between the gilded arms &s;at VANITY deck'd in the Pea|cock's feathers, and acknowledged for another Venus by her votaries. The boy who &s;tood be&s;ide her for a Cupid, and who made the world to bow before her, was called SELF-CONCEIT. His eyes had every now and then a ca&s;t inwards, to the neglect of all objects about him; and the arms which he made u&s;e of for conque&s;t, were borrowed from tho&s;e again&s;t whom he had a de|&s;ign. The arrow which he &s;hot at the &s;oldier, was fledg'd from his own plume of feathers; the dart he di|rected again&s;t the man of wit, was winged from the quills he writ with; and that which he &s;ent again&s;t tho&s;e who pre&s;umed upon their riches, was headed with gold out of their trea&s;uries: he made nets for &s;tate&s;men from their own contrivances; he took fire from the eyes of ladies, with which he melted their
<PB N="113" REF="116">hearts; and lightning from the tongues of the eloquent, to enflame them with their own glories. At the foot of the throne &s;at three fal&s;e Graces. FLATTERY with a &s;hell of paint, AFFECTATION with a mirrour to prac|ti&s;e at, and FASHION ever changing the po&s;ture of her cloaths. The&s;e applied them&s;elves to &s;ecure the con|que&s;ts which SELF-CONCEIT had gotten, and had each of them their particular polities. FLATTERY gave new colours and complexions to all things; AFFECTATION new airs and appearances, which, as &s;he &s;aid, were not vulgar; and FASHION both concealed &s;ome home de|fects, and added &s;ome foreign external beauties.</P>
<P>As I was reflecting upon what I &s;aw, I heard a voice in the crowd, bemoaning the condition of man|kind, which is thus managed by the breath of OPINION, deluded by ERROR, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir'd by SELF-CONCEIT, and given up to be trained in all the cour&s;es of VANITY, 'till SCORN or POVERTY come upon us. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions were no &s;ooner handed about, but I immediately &s;aw a general di&s;order, till at la&s;t there was a parting in one place, and a grave old man, decent and re&s;olute, was led forward to be puni&s;hed for the words he had uttered. He appeared inclined to have &s;poken in his own defence, but I could not ob&s;erve that any one was willing to hear him. VANITY ca&s;t a &s;cornful &s;mile athim; SELF-CONCEIT was angry; FLATTERY, who knew him for PLAIN-DEALING, put on a vizard, and turned away; AFFECTATION to&s;&s;ed her fan, made mouths, and cal|led
<PB N="114" REF="117">him ENVY or SLANDER; and FASHION would have it, that at lea&s;t he mu&s;t be ILL-MANNERS. Thus &s;light|ed and de&s;pi&s;ed by all, he was driven out for abu&s;ing people of merit and figure; and I heard it firmly re&s;olv|ed, that he &s;hould be u&s;ed no better where-ever they met with him hereafter.</P>
<P>I had already &s;een the meaning of mo&s;t part of that warning which he had given, and was con&s;idering how the latter words &s;hould be fulfilled, when a mighty noi&s;e was heard without, and the door was blackned by a numerous train of harpies crowding in upon us. FOLLY and BROKEN CREDIT were &s;een in the hou&s;e before they entered. TROUBLE, SHAME, INFAMY, SCORN and POVERTY brought up the rear. VANITY, with her Cupid and Graces, di&s;appeared; her &s;ubjects ran into holes and corners; but many of them were found and carried off (as I was told by one who &s;tood near me) either to pri&s;ons or cellars, &s;olitude, or little company, the mean arts or the viler crafts of life. But the&s;e, added he with a di&s;dainful air, are &s;uch who would fondly live here, when their merits neither matched the lu&s;tre of the place, nor their riches its expences. We have &s;een &s;uch &s;cenes as the&s;e before now; the glory you &s;aw will all return when the hurry is over. I thank'd him for his information, and be|lieving him &s;o incorrigible as that he would &s;tay till it was his turn to be taken, I made off to the door, and overtook &s;ome few, who, though they would not hear|ken
<PB N="115" REF="118">to PLAIN-DEALING, were now terrified to good purpo&s;e by the example of others: but when they had touched the thre&s;hold, it was a &s;trange &s;hock to them to find that the delu&s;ion of ERROR was gone, and they plainly di&s;cerned the building to hang a little up in the air without any real foundation. At fir&s;t we &s;aw no|thing but a de&s;perate leap remained for us, and I a thou|&s;and times blamed my unmeaning curio&s;ity that had brought me into &s;o much danger. But as they began to &s;ink lower in their own minds, methought the pa|lace &s;unk along with us; till they were arrived at the due point of ESTEEM which they ought to have for them&s;elves; then the part of the building in which they &s;tood touched the earth, and we departing out, it re|tired from our eyes. Now, whether they who &s;tayed in the palace were &s;en&s;ible of this de&s;cent, I cannot tell; it was then my opinion that they were not. However it be, my dream broke up at it, and has given me oc|ca&s;ion all my life to reflect upon the fatal con&s;equences of following the &s;ugge&s;tions of VANITY.</P>

<P>HOW are we tortured with the ab&s;ence of what we covet to po&s;&s;e&s;s, when it appears to be lo&s;t to us! what excur&s;ions does the &s;oul make in imagina|tion after it! and how does it turn into it&s;elf again, more fooli&s;hly fond and dejected, at the di&s;appoint|ment! our grief, in&s;tead of having recour&s;e to rea&s;on, which might re&s;train it, &s;earches to find a further nou|ri&s;hment. It calls upon memory to relate the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages and circum&s;tances of &s;atisfactions which we formerly enjoyed; the plea&s;ures we purcha&s;ed by tho&s;e riches that are taken from us; or the power and &s;plen|dour of our departed honours; or the voice, the words, the looks, the temper, and affections of our friends that are decea&s;ed. It needs mu&s;t happen from hence, that the pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould often &s;well to &s;uch a &s;ize as to bur&s;t the heart which contains it, if time did not make the&s;e circum&s;tances le&s;s &s;trong and lively, &s;o that rea&s;on &s;hould become a more equal match for the pa&s;&s;ion, or
<PB N="117" REF="120">if another de&s;ire which becomes more pre&s;ent did not overpower them with a livelier repre&s;entation. The&s;e are thoughts which I had, when I fell into a kind of vi&s;ion upon this &s;ubject, and may therefore &s;tand for a proper introduction to a relation of it.</P>
<P>I found my&s;elf upon a naked &s;hore, with company who&s;e afflicted countenances witne&s;&s;ed their conditions. Before us flowed a water deep, &s;ilent, and called the ri|ver of TEARS, which i&s;&s;uing from two fountains on an upper ground, encompa&s;&s;ed an i&s;land that lay before us. The boat which plied in it was old and &s;hatter'd, having been &s;ometimes over&s;et by the impatience and ha&s;te of &s;ingle pa&s;&s;engers to arrive at the other &s;ide. This immediately was brought to us by MISFORTUNE who &s;teers it, and we were all preparing to take our places, when there appeared a woman of a mild and compo&s;ed behaviour, who began to deter us from it, by repre&s;enting the dangers which would attend our voyage. Hereupon &s;ome who knew her for PATIENCE, and &s;ome of tho&s;e too who 'till then cry'd the loude&s;t, were per&s;uaded by her, and return'd back. The re&s;t of us went in, and &s;he (who&s;e good-nature would not &s;uffer her to for&s;ake per&s;ons in trouble) de&s;ired leave to ac|company us, that &s;he might at lea&s;t admini&s;ter &s;ome &s;mall comfort or advice while we &s;ailed. We were no &s;ooner embarked but the boat was pu&s;hed off, the &s;heet was &s;pread; and being filled with &s;ighs, which are the winds of that country, we made a pa&s;&s;age to the far|ther

<P>When we landed, we perceived the i&s;land to be &s;trangely over-ca&s;t with fogs, which no brightne&s;s could pierce, &s;o that a kind of gloomy horror &s;at al|ways brooding over it. This had &s;omething in it very &s;hocking to ea&s;y tempers, in&s;omuch that &s;ome others, whom PATIENCE had by this time gain'd over, left us here, and privily convey'd them&s;elves round the verge of the i&s;land to find a ford by which &s;he told them they might e&s;cape.</P>
<P>For my part, I &s;till went along with tho&s;e who were for piercing into the centre of the place; and joining our&s;elves to others whom we found upon the &s;ame journey, we marched &s;olemnly as at a funeral, thro' bordering hedges of ro&s;emary, and thro' a grove of yew-trees, which love to over-&s;hadow tombs and flou|ri&s;h in church-yards. Here we heard on every &s;ide the wailings and complaints of &s;everal of the inhabitants, who had ca&s;t them&s;elves di&s;con&s;olately at the feet of trees; and as we chanc'd to approach any of the&s;e, we might perceive them wringing their hands, beating their brea&s;ts, tearing their hair, or after &s;ome other manner vi&s;ibly agitated with vexation. Our &s;orrows were heigh|tened by the influence of what we heard and &s;aw, and one of our number was wrought up to &s;uch a pitch of wildne&s;s, as to talk of hanging him&s;elf upon a bough which &s;hot temptingly a-cro&s;s the path we travelled in;
<PB N="119" REF="122">but he was re&s;train'd from it by the kind endeavours of our above-mentioned companion.</P>
<P>We had now gotten into the mo&s;t du&s;ky &s;ilent part of the i&s;land, and by the redoubled &s;ounds of &s;ighs, which made a doleful whi&s;tling in the branches, the thickne&s;s of air which occa&s;ioned fainti&s;h re&s;piration, and the violent throbbings of heart which more and more affected us, we found that we approach'd the GROTTO OF GRIEF. It was a wide, hollow, and me|lancholy cave, &s;unk deep in a dale, and watered by ri|vulets that had a colour between red and black. The&s;e crept &s;low, and half congealed among&s;t its windings, and mixed their heavy murmur with the echo of groans that rolled thro' all the pa&s;&s;ages. In the mo&s;t retired part of it &s;at the DOLEFUL BEING her&s;elf; the path to her was &s;trewed with goads, &s;tings, and thorns; and the throne on which &s;he &s;at was broken into a rock with ragged pieces pointing upwards for her to lean upon. A heavy mi&s;t hung above her, her head oppre&s;&s;ed with it reclined upon her arm: thus did &s;he reign over her di&s;con&s;olate &s;ubjects, full of her&s;elf to &s;tupidity, in e|ternal pen&s;ivene&s;s, and the profounde&s;t &s;ilence. On one &s;ide of her &s;tood DEJECTION ju&s;t dropping into a &s;woon, and PALENESS wa&s;ting to a &s;keleton; on the other &s;ide were CARE inwardly tormented with imagi|nations, and ANGUISH &s;uffering outward TROUBLES to &s;uck the blood from her heart in the &s;hape of VUL|TURES. The whole vault had a genuine di&s;malne&s;s in
<PB N="120" REF="123">it, which a few &s;cattered lamps, who&s;e bluei&s;h flames aro&s;e and &s;unk in their urns, di&s;covered to our eyes with encrea&s;e. Some of us fell down, overcome and &s;pent with what they &s;uffer'd in the way, and were gi|ven over to tho&s;e tormenters that &s;tood on either hand of the pre&s;ence; others, galled and mortified with pain, recover'd the entrance, where PATIENCE, whom we had left behind, was &s;till waiting to receive us.</P>
<P>With her (who&s;e company was now become more grateful to us by the want we had found of her) we winded round the grotto, and a&s;cended at the back of it, out of the mournful dale in who&s;e bottom it lay. On this eminence we halted, by her advice, to pant for breath; and li&s;ting our eyes, which till then were fixed downwards, felt a &s;ullen &s;ort of &s;atisfaction, in ob&s;erving thro' the &s;hades what numbers had entered the i&s;land. This &s;atisfaction, which appears to have ill-nature in it, was excu&s;able, becau&s;e it happened at a time when we were too much taken up with our own concern, to have re&s;pect to that of others; and there|fore we did not con&s;ider them as &s;uffering, but our|&s;elves as not &s;uffering in the mo&s;t forlorn e&s;tate. It had al&s;o the groundwork of humanity and compa&s;&s;ion in it, though the mind was then too deeply engaged to perceive it; but as we proceeded onwards it began to di&s;cover it&s;elf, and from ob&s;erving that others were un|happy, we came to que&s;tion one another, when it was that we met, and what were the &s;ad occa&s;ions that
<PB N="121" REF="124">brought us together. Then we heard our &s;tories, we compared them, we mutually gave and received pity, and &s;o by degrees became tolerable company.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable part of the trouble&s;ome road was thus deceived; at length the openings among the trees grew larger, the air &s;eemed thinner, it lay with le&s;s oppre&s;|&s;ion upon us, and we could now and then di&s;cern tracts in it of a lighter greyne&s;s, like the breakings of day, &s;hort in duration, much enlivening, and called in that country GLEAMS OF AMUSEMENT. Within a &s;hort while the&s;e gleams began to appear more frequent, and then brighter and of a longer continuance; the SIGHS that hitherto filled the air with &s;o much dolefulne&s;s, al|tered to the &s;ound of common breezes, and in general the horrors of the i&s;land were abated.</P>
<P>When we had arrived at la&s;t at the ford by which we were to pa&s;s out, we met with tho&s;e fa&s;hionable mourners who had been ferried over along with us, and who being unwilling to go as far as we, had coa&s;t|ed by the &s;hore, to find the place, where they waited our coming; that by &s;hewing them&s;elves to the world only at that time when we did, they might &s;eem al&s;o to have been among the troubles of the grotto. Here the waters, that rolled on the other &s;ide &s;o deep and &s;i|lent, were much dried up, and it was an ea&s;ter matter for us to wade over.</P>
<P>The river being cro&s;&s;ed, we were received upon the further bank by our friends and acquaintance, whom
<PB N="122" REF="125">COMFORT had brought out to congratulate our appear|ance in the world again. Some of the&s;e blamed us for &s;taying &s;o long away from them, others advi&s;ed us a|gain&s;t all temptations of going back again; every one was cautious not to renew our trouble, by a&s;king any particulars of the journey; and all concluded, that in a ca&s;e of &s;o much affliction, we could not have made choice of a fitter companion than PATIENCE. Here PATIENCE, appearing &s;erene at her prai&s;es, delivered us over to COMFORT. COMFORT &s;miled at his re|ceiving the charge; immediately the &s;ky purpledon that &s;ide to which he turned, and double day at once broke in upon me.</P>

<P>I Was con&s;idering la&s;t night, when I could not &s;leep, how noble a part of the creation Man was de&s;ign'd to be, and how di&s;tingui&s;hed in all his actions above other earthly creatures. From whence I fell to take a view of the change and corruption which he has in|troduced into his own condition, the groveling appe|tites, the mean characters of &s;en&s;e, and wild cour&s;es of pa&s;&s;ions, that ca&s;t him from the degree in which Pro|vidence had placed him, the deba&s;ing him&s;elf with qua|lifications not his own, and his degenerating into a lower &s;phere of action. This in&s;pired me with a mix|ture of contempt and anger; which, however, was not &s;o violent as to hinder the return of &s;leep, but grew confu&s;ed as that came upon me, and made me end my
<PB N="124" REF="127">reflections with giving mankind the opprobrious names of incon&s;iderate, mad and fooli&s;h.</P>
<P>Here methought, where my waking rea&s;on left the &s;ubject, my fancy pur&s;ued it in a dream; and I ima|gined my&s;elf in a loud &s;oliloquy of pa&s;&s;ion, railing at my &s;pecies, and walking hard to get rid of the com|pany I de&s;pi&s;ed; when two men who had over-heard me made up on either hand. The&s;e I ob&s;erved had many features in common, which might occa&s;ion the mi&s;take of the one for the other in tho&s;e to whom they appear &s;ingle, but I, who &s;aw them together, could ea|&s;ily perceive, that tho' there was an air of &s;everity in each, it was tempered with a natural &s;weetne&s;s in the one, and by turns con&s;trained or tu&s;&s;led by the de&s;igns of malice in the other.</P>
<P>I was at a lo&s;s to know the rea&s;on of their joining me &s;o bri&s;kly, when he who&s;e appearance di&s;plea&s;ed me mo&s;t, thus addre&s;&s;ed his companion. Pray, brother, let him alone, and we &s;hall immediately &s;ee him tran&s;|formed into a Tyger. This &s;truck me with horror, which the other perceived, and pitying my di&s;order, bid me be of good courage, for tho' I had been &s;avage in my treatment of mankind, (whom I &s;hould rather reform than rail again&s;t) he would, however, endeavour to re|&s;cue me from my danger. At this I looked a little more chearful, and while I te&s;tified my re&s;ignation to him, ve &s;aw the angry brother &s;ling away from us in a pa&s;|&s;ion for his di&s;appointment. Being now left to my
<PB N="125" REF="128">friend, I went back with him at his de&s;ire, that might know the meaning of tho&s;e words which &s;o affright|ted me.</P>
<P>As we went along, to inform you, &s;ays he, with whom you have this adventure, my name is REPROOF and his REPROACH, both born of the &s;ame mother, but of different fathers. TRUTH is our common parent. FRIENDSHIP. who &s;aw her, fell in love with her, and &s;he being plea&s;ed with him, he begat me upon her; but a while after ENMITY lying in ambu&s;h for her, be|came the father of him whom you &s;aw along with me. The temper of our mother enclines us to the fame &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s, the informing mankind of their faults; but the differing complexions of our fathers make us dif|fer in our de&s;igns and company. I have a natural be|nevolence in my mind which engages me with friends, and he a natural impetuo&s;ity in his, which ca&s;ts him among enemies.</P>
<P>As he thus di&s;cour&s;ed he came to a place where there were three entrances into as many &s;everal walks, which lay be&s;ide one another. We pa&s;&s;ed into the middlemo&s;t, a plain, &s;trait, regular walk, &s;et with trees, which ad|ded to the beauty of the place, but did not &s;o clo&s;e their boughs over head as to exclude the light from it. Here as we walked I was made to ob&s;erve, how the road on one hand was full of rocks and precipices, o|ver which REPROACH (who had already gotten thither) was furiou&s;ly driving unhappy wretches; the other &s;ide
<PB N="126" REF="129">was all laid out in gardens of gaudy tulips, among&s;t who&s;e leaves the &s;erpents wreath'd, and at the end of every gra&s;&s;y walk the enchantre&s;s FLATTERY was weav|ing bowers to lull &s;ouls a&s;leep in. We continued &s;till walking on the middle way, 'till we arrived in a build|ing in which it terminated. This was formerly erected by TRUTH for a watch tower, from whence &s;he took a view of the earth, and, as &s;he &s;aw occa&s;ion, &s;ent out REPROOF, or even REPROACH, for our reformation. Over the door I took notice that a face was carved with a heart upon the lips of it, and pre&s;ently call'd to mind that this was the ancients emblem of SINCERITY. In the entrance I met with FREEDOM OF SPEECH and COMPLAISANCE, who had for a long time looked upon one another as enemies; but REPROOF has &s;o happily brought them together, that they now act as friends and fellow-agents in the &s;ame family. Before I a&s;cend|ed up the &s;tairs, I had my eyes purified by a water which made me &s;ee extremely clear, and I think they &s;aid it &s;prung in a pit, from whence (as Democritus had reported) they formerly brought up TRUTH, who had hid her&s;elf in it. I was then admitted to the upper chamber of pro&s;pect, which was called THE KNOW|LEDGE OF MANKIND; here the window was no &s;ooner opened but I perceived the clouds to roll off and part before me, and a &s;cene of all the variety of the world pre&s;ented it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But how different was mankind in this view, from
<PB N="127" REF="130">what it u&s;ed to appear! methought the very &s;hape of mo&s;t of them was lo&s;t; &s;ome had the heads of Dogs, o|thers of Apes or Parrots, and in &s;hort, where-ever any one took upon him the inferior and unworthy qualities of other creatures, the change of his &s;oul became vi|&s;ible in his countenance. The &s;trutting pride of him who is endued with brutality in&s;tead of courage, made his face &s;hoot out in the form of a Hor&s;e's; his eyes be|came prominent, his no&s;trils widened, and his wig un|tying flowed down on one &s;ide of his neck in a waving mane. The talkativene&s;s of tho&s;e who love the ill-na|ture of conver&s;ation made them turn into a&s;&s;emblies of Gee&s;e, their lips hardened into bills by eternal u&s;|ing, they gabbled for diver&s;ion, they hi&s;s'd in &s;candal, and their ruffles falling back on their arms, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of little feathers appeared, which formed wings for them to flutter with from one vi&s;it to another. The envious and malicious lay on the ground with the heads of different &s;orts of Serpents, and not endeavouring to erect them&s;elves, but meditating mi&s;chief to others, they &s;uck'd the poi&s;on of the earth, &s;harpened their tongues to &s;tings upon the &s;tones, and rolled their trains unperceivably beneath their habits. The hypo|critical oppre&s;&s;ors wore the faces of Crocodiles, their mouths were in&s;truments of cruelty, their eyes of de|ceit; they committed wickedne&s;s, and bemoaned that there &s;hould be &s;o much of it in the world; they de|voured the unwary, and wept over the remains of them.
<PB N="128" REF="131">The covetous had &s;o hook'd and worn their fingers by counting intere&s;t upon intere&s;t, that they converted to the claws of Harpies, and the&s;e they &s;till were &s;tretch|ing out for more, yet &s;eem'd un&s;atisfied with their ac|qui&s;itions. The &s;harpers had the looks of Camelions; they every minute changed their appearance, and fed on &s;warms of Flies which fell as &s;o many Collies a|mong&s;t them. The bully &s;eemed a dunghil Cock, he cre&s;ted well, and bore his comb aloft; he was beaten by almo&s;t every one, yet &s;till &s;ung for triumph; and only the mean coward prick'd up the ears of a Hare to fly before him. Critics were turned into Cats, who&s;e plea|&s;ure and grumbling go together. Fopes were Apes in embroidered jackets. Flatterers were curled Spaniels, &s;awning and crouching. The crafty had the face of a Fox, the &s;lothful of an A&s;s, the cruel of a Wolf, the ill-bred of a bear, the leachers were Goats, and the gluttons Swine. Drunkenne&s;s was the only vice that did not change the face of its profe&s;&s;ors into that of another creature; but this I took to be far from a pri|vilege, for the&s;e two rea&s;ons; becau&s;e it &s;ufficiently deforms them of it&s;elf, and becau&s;e none of the lower ranks of beings is guilty of &s;o fooli&s;h an intempe|rance.</P>
<P>As I was taking a view of the&s;e repre&s;entations of things, without any more order than is u&s;ual in a dream, or in the confu&s;ion of the world it&s;elf, I per|ceived a concern within me for what I &s;aw; my eyes
<PB N="129" REF="132">began to moi&s;ten, and as if the virtue of that water with which they were purified was lo&s;t for a time, by their being touched with that which aro&s;e from a pa&s;|&s;ion, the clouds immediately began to gather again, and clo&s;e from either hand upon the pro&s;pect I then turn|ed towards my guide, who addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me af|ter this manner. You have &s;een the condition of man|kind when it de&s;cends from its dignity; now there|fore guard your&s;elf from that degeneracy by a mode&s;t greatne&s;s of &s;pirit on one &s;ide, and a con&s;cious &s;hame on the other. Endeavour al&s;o with a genero&s;ity of goodne&s;s to make your friends aware of it; let them know what defects you perceive are growing upon them; handle the matter as you &s;ee rea&s;on, either with the airs of &s;evere or humourous affection; &s;ometimes plainly de&s;cribing the degeneracy in its full proper co|lours, or at other times letting them know that if they proceed as they have begun, you give them to &s;uch a day or &s;o many months to turn Bears, Wolves, or Foxes, &amp;c. Neither neglect your more remote ac|quaintance, where you &s;ee any worthy and &s;u&s;ceptible of admonition; expo&s;e the bea&s;ts who&s;e qualities you &s;ee them putting on, where you have no mind to en|gage with their per&s;ons. The po&s;&s;ibility of their ap|plying this is very obvious: the Egyptians &s;aw it &s;o clearly, that they made the pictures of animals explain their minds to one another in&s;tead of writing; and
<PB N="130" REF="133">indeed it is hardly to be mi&s;&s;ed, &s;ince Ae&s;op took them out of their mute condition, and taught them to &s;peak for them&s;elves with relation to the actions of mankind.</P>

<P>THERE is a &s;ett of mankind, who are wholly employed in the ill-natured office of gathering up a collection of &s;tories that le&s;&s;en the reputation of others, and &s;preading them abroad with a certain air of &s;atisfaction. Perhaps, indeed, an innocent and unmean|ing curio&s;ity, a de&s;ire of being informed concerning tho&s;e we live with, or a willingne&s;s to pro&s;it by reflection upon the actions of others, may &s;ometimes afford an excu&s;e, or &s;ometimes a defence, for inqui&s;itivene&s;s; but certainly it is beyond all excu&s;e, a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion again&s;t huma|nity, to carry the matter further, to tear off the dre&s;|&s;ings, as I may &s;ay, from the wounds of a friend, and expo&s;e them to the air in cruel fits of diver&s;ion; and yet we have &s;omething more to bemoan, an outrage of an higher nature, which mankind is guilty of when they are not content to &s;pread the &s;tories of folly, frail|ty and vice, but even enlarge them, or invent new ones, and blacken characters that we may appear ri|diculous,
<PB N="132" REF="135">or hateful to one another. From &s;uch prac|tices as the&s;e it happens, that &s;ome feel a &s;orrow, and others are agitated with a &s;pirit of revenge; that &s;can|dals or lies are told, becau&s;e another has told &s;uch be|fore; that re&s;entments and quarrels ari&s;e, and injuries are given, received, and multiplied, in a &s;cene of ven|geance.</P>
<P>All this I have often ob&s;erved with abundance of concern; and having a perfect de&s;ire to further the hap|pine&s;s of mankind, I lately &s;et my&s;elf to con&s;ider the cau&s;es from whence &s;uch evils ari&s;e, and the remedies which may be applied. Whereupon I &s;hut my eyes to prevent di&s;traction from outward objects, and a while after &s;hot away, upon an impul&s;e of thought, into the WORLD OF IDEAS, where ab&s;tracted qualities became vi&s;ible in &s;uch appearances as wer agreeable to each of their natures.</P>
<P>That part of the country, where I happened to light, was the mo&s;t noi&s;y that I had ever known. The winds whi&s;tled, the leaves ru&s;tled, the brooks rumbled, the birds chatter'd, the tongues of men were heard, and the echo mingled &s;omething of every &s;ound in its repe|tition, &s;o that there was a &s;trange confu&s;ion and up|roar of &s;ounds about me. At length, as the noi&s;e &s;till encrea&s;ed, I could di&s;cern a man habited like a herald (and as I afterwards under&s;tood) called NOVELTY, that came forward proclaiming a &s;olemn day to be kept at the hou&s;e of COMMON FAME. Immediately behind him
<PB N="133" REF="136">advanced three nymphs, who had mo&s;trous appear|ances. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was CURIOSITY, habited like a virgin, and having an hundred ears upon her head to &s;erve in her inquiries. The &s;econd of the&s;e was TAL|KATIVENESS, a little better grown, &s;he &s;eemed to be like a young wife, and had an hundred tongues to &s;pread her &s;tories. The third was CENSORIOUSNESS, habited like a widow, and &s;urrounded with an hundred &s;quinting eyes of a malignant influence, which &s;o ob|liquely darted on all around, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay which of them had brought in the informations &s;he boa&s;ted of. The&s;e, as I was informed, had been very in&s;trumental in pre&s;erving and rearing COMMON FAME, when upon her birth-day &s;he was &s;huffled into a crowd, to e&s;cape the &s;earch which TRUTH might have made after her and her parents. CURIOSITY found here there, TALKATIVENESS convey'd her a|way, and CENSORIOUSNESS &s;o nur&s;ed her up, that in a &s;hort time &s;he grew to a prodigious &s;ize, and obtain|ed an empire over the univer&s;e; wherefore the POWER, in gratitude for the&s;e &s;ervices, has &s;ince advanced them to her highe&s;t employments. The next who came for|ward in this proce&s;&s;ion was a light dam&s;el, called CRE|DULITY, who carried behind them the lamp, the &s;il|ver ve&s;&s;el with a &s;pout, and other in&s;truments proper for this &s;olemn occa&s;ion. She had formerly &s;een the&s;e three together, and conjecturing from the number of their ears, tongues and eyes, that they might be the
<PB N="134" REF="137">proper Genii of ATTENTION, FAMILIAR CONVERSE, and OCULAR DEMONSTRATION, &s;he from that time gave her&s;elf up to attend them. The la&s;t who followed were &s;ome who had clo&s;ely muffled them&s;elves in up|per garments, &s;o that I could not di&s;cern who they were; but ju&s;t as the &s;oremo&s;t of them was come up, I am glad, &s;ays &s;he, calling me by my name, to meet you at this time, &s;tay clo&s;e by me, and take a &s;trict ob|&s;ervation of all that pa&s;&s;es. Her voice was &s;weet and commanding, I thought I had &s;omewhere heard it; and from her, as I went along, I learned the meaning of every thing which offered.</P>
<P>We now marched forward thro' the ROOKERY OF RUMOURS, which flew thick and with a terrible din all around us. At length we arrived at the hou&s;e of COMMON FAME, where a hecatomb of REPUTATIONS was that day to fall for her plea&s;ure. The hou&s;e &s;tood upon an eminence, having a thou&s;and pa&s;&s;ages to it, and a thou&s;and whi&s;pering holes for the conveyance of found. The hall we entered was formed with the art of a mu&s;ic chamber for the improvement of noi&s;es. REST and SILENCE are bani&s;hed the place. STORIES of different natures wander in light flocks all about, &s;ometimes truths and lies, or &s;ometimes lies them&s;elves cla&s;hing again&s;t one another. In the middle &s;tood a table painted after the manner of the remote&s;t A&s;iatic countries, upon which the lamp, the &s;ilver ve&s;&s;el, and cups of a white earth, were planted in order. Then
<PB N="135" REF="138">dried herbs were brought, collected for the &s;olemnity in moon-&s;hine, and water being put to them, there was a greeni&s;h liquor made, to which they added the flower of milk, and an extraction from the canes of America, for performing a libation to the infer|nal POWERS OF MISCHIEF. After this, CURIOSITY, retiring to a withdrawing-room, brought forth the VICTIMS, being to appearance a &s;ett of &s;mall waxen images, which &s;he laid upon the table one after ano|ther. Immediately TALKATIVENESS gave each of them the name of &s;ome one, whom for the time they were to repre&s;ent; and CENSORIOUSNESS &s;tuck them all about with black pins, &s;till pronouncing at every one &s;he &s;tuck, &s;omething to the prejudice of the per|&s;ons repre&s;ented. No &s;ooner were the&s;e rites perform|ed, and incantations uttered, but the &s;ound of a &s;peak|ing trumpet was heard in the air, by which they knew the Deity of the place was propitiated and a&s;&s;i&s;ting. Upon this the &s;ky grew darker, a &s;torm aro&s;e, and mur|murs, &s;ighs, groans, cries, and the words of grief or re|&s;entment were heard within it. Thus the three Sor|cere&s;&s;es di&s;covered, that they, who&s;e names they had given to the images, were already affected with what was done to them in e&s;&s;igy. The knowledge of this was received with the loude&s;t laughter, and in many congratulatory words they applauded one another's wit and power.</P>
<P>As matters were at this high point of di&s;order, the
<PB N="136" REF="139">muffled lady, whom I attended on, being no longer able to endure &s;uch barbarous proceedings, threw off her upper garment of RESERVE, and appeared to be TRUTH. As &s;oon as &s;he had confe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf pre&s;ent, the &s;peaking trumpet ceas'd to &s;ound, the &s;ky cleared up, the &s;torm abated, the noi&s;es which were heard in it ended, the laughter of the company was over, and a &s;erene light, till then unknown to the place, was dif|fu&s;ed around it. At this the detected Sorcere&s;&s;es en|deavoured to e&s;cape in a cloud which I &s;aw began to thicken about them, but it was &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed, their charms being controuled and prevailed over by the &s;u|perior Divinity. For my part I was exceedingly glad to &s;ee it &s;o, and began to con&s;ider what puni&s;hments &s;he would inflict upon them. I fancied it would be proper to cut off CURIOSITY'S ears, and &s;ix them to the eaves of the hou&s;es, to nail the tongue of TALKATIVENESS to Indian tables, and to put out the eyes of CENSO|RIOUSNESS with a fla&s;h of her light. In re&s;pect of CREDULITY I had indeed &s;ome little pity, and had I been judge, &s;he might, perhaps, have e&s;caped with a hearty reproof.</P>
<P>But I &s;oon found that the di&s;cerning Judge had o|ther de&s;igns, &s;he knew, them for &s;uch as will not be de|&s;troyed entirely while mankind is in being, and yet ought to have a brand and puni&s;hment affixed to them that they may be avoided. Wherefore &s;he took a &s;eat for judgment, and had the Criminals brought forward
<PB N="137" REF="140">by SHAME ever blu&s;hing, and TROUBLE with a whip of many la&s;hes, two phantoms who had dogged the Proce&s;&s;ion in di&s;gui&s;e, and waited till they had an au|thority from TRUTH to lay hands upon them. Imme|diately then &s;he ordered CURIOSITY and TALKATIVE|NEES to be fettered together, that the one &s;hould never &s;uffer the other to re&s;t, nor the other ever let her re|main undi&s;covered. Light CREDULITY &s;he linkt to SHAME at the tormenter's own reque&s;t, who was plea&s;|ed to be thus &s;ecure that her pri&s;oner &s;hould not e|&s;cape; and this was done partly for her puni&s;hment, and partly for her amendment. CENSORIOUSNESS was al&s;o in like manner begged by TROUBLE, and had her a&s;&s;ign'd for an eternal companion. After they were thus chain'd with one another, by the judge's order, &s;he drove them from the pre&s;ence to wander for ever thro' the world, with NOVELTY &s;talking before them.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e being now over, &s;he retreated from &s;ight within the &s;plendor of her own glory, which leaving the hou&s;e it had brightned, the &s;ounds that were pro|per to the place began to be as loud and con&s;u&s;ed as when we entered, and there being no longer a clear di&s;tingui&s;hed appearance of any objects repre&s;ented to me, I returned from the excur&s;ion I had made in fancy.</P>

<HEAD>VISION V.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER indu&s;try and eagerne&s;s the modern di&s;coverers have &s;hewn for the knowledge of new countries, there yet remains an ample field in the creation to which they are utter &s;trangers, and which all the methods of travelling hitherto invented, will never bring them acquainted with. Of this I can give a very particular in&s;tance in an accident which lately happened to me.</P>
<P>As I was on the 6th of this in&s;tant, being Febru|ary 1715, walking with my eyes ca&s;t upward, I fell into a reflection on the va&s;t tracts of air which ap|pear'd before me as uninhabited. And wherefore, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, &s;hou'd all this &s;pace be created? can it only be for an odd bird to fly through, as now and then a man may pa&s;s a de&s;art? Or are there al&s;o kingdoms with their particular polities and people of a &s;pecies which we know nothing of, ordain'd to live in it?</P>
<P>It was in this manner I continued my thought, when my feet for&s;ook the level, and I was in&s;en&s;ibly mounted in the air, till I arriv'd at a footing as firm
<PB N="139" REF="142">and level as what I had left. But with what &s;urprize did I find my&s;elf among creatures di&s;tinct from us in &s;hape and cu&s;toms?</P>
<P>The inhabitants are of a &s;mall &s;tature, below tho&s;e which hi&s;tory de&s;cribes for Pigmies. The talle&s;t of them exceed not fourteen or fifteen inches, and the lea&s;t are hardly three. This difference proceeds only from their growth before they are brought to light; for af|ter we never ob&s;erve them to grow, unle&s;s it plea&s;e their parents, who have this uncommon method of enabling them: they recall them to the womb, where having been for &s;ome time, they receive an addition to their bulk, then go back to their hou&s;es, and continue at a &s;tand as they did before. The experiment has been often try'd with &s;ucce&s;s, but &s;ome have &s;uffered ex|tremely by undergoing it.</P>
<P>Their &s;kins are like the ancient Britain, all drawn over with a variety of figures. The colour made u&s;e of for this end, is generally black. I have indeed ob&s;erv|ed in &s;ome of the religious, and lawyers of the country, red here and there intermingled, tho' not &s;o common|ly of late. They tell me too, they often us'd to paint with all colours; and I vi&s;ited two or three of the old inhabitants, who were adorn'd in that fa&s;hion: but this is now di&s;u&s;ed, &s;ince the new inventions, by which the u&s;e of a black fountain that belongs to that coun|try, is render'd more u&s;eful and &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>The Cloaths in which they go clad, are the &s;kins
<PB N="140" REF="143">of bea&s;ts; worn by &s;ome plain, by others with figure: wrought upon them. Gold is al&s;o made u&s;e of by &s;ome, to beautify their apparel; but very &s;eldom &s;ilver, un|le&s;s, as buckles are by us, for fa&s;tening the garment be|fore. I have &s;een &s;ome of them go like &s;eamen in thin blue &s;hirts, others like Indians in a party-colour'd loo&s;e kind of apparel, and others who they told me were the Politicians of the country, go about &s;tark naked.</P>
<P>The manner of dre&s;&s;ing them is this: at fir&s;t when they come into the world, they have a &s;uit given them, which if it do not fit exactly, is not, as with us, fitted up again, but the children are in a cruel manner cut and &s;queez'd to bring them to its proportion. Yet this they &s;eem not much to regard, provided their princi|pal parts are not affected. When the dre&s;s is thus &s;et|tled on them, they are clad for life, it being &s;eldom their cu&s;tom to alter it, or put it off: in &s;hort, they live in it night and day, and wear it to rags rather than part with it, being &s;ure of the &s;ame torture, and a great|er danger if they &s;hould be dre&s;s'd a &s;econd time. I have further taken notice, that they delight to go o|pen brea&s;ted, mo&s;t of them &s;hewing their bo&s;oms &s;peck|led. Some Lawyers indeed wear them quite white, perhaps for di&s;tinction &s;ake, or to be known at a di&s;|tance. But the fine&s;t &s;hew is among the beaux and la|dies, who mightily affect &s;omething of gold, both be|fore and behind them.</P>
<P>Food I never &s;aw them eat; they being a people,
<PB N="141" REF="144">who, as I ob&s;erved, live in air: their hou&s;es are all &s;ingle and high, having no back rooms, but frequent|ly &s;even or eight &s;tories, which are all &s;eparate hou&s;es above one another. They have one gate to their city, and generally no doors to their hou&s;es; tho' I have &s;ometimes &s;een them have particular doors, and even made of gla&s;s, where the inhabitants have been ob|&s;erv'd to &s;tand many days, that their fine apparel may be &s;een thro' them. If at any time they lie down, which they do when they come from their habitations (as if coming abroad were their greate&s;t fatigue) they will lie together in heaps without receiving hurt: though the &s;ounde&s;t &s;leep they get, is when they can have du&s;t e|nough to cover them over.</P>
<P>The females among&s;t them are but few, nothing be|ing there produced by a marriage of &s;exes. The males are of a different &s;trength or endowment of parts, &s;ome having knowledge in an extream degree, and others none at all; yet at the &s;ame time, they are mighty pre|tenders to in&s;truct others. Their Names, (for as many as wou'd di&s;cover them to me) I ob&s;erv'd to be the very &s;ame as ours are upon earth; I met a few who made theirs a my&s;tery, but why, I am yet to learn. They are &s;o communicative, that they will tell all the knowledge they boa&s;t, if a &s;tranger apply him&s;elf to their conver&s;ation: and this may be worth his while, if he con&s;iders that all languages, arts, and &s;ciences, are profe&s;t among&s;t them. I think I may &s;ay it with|out
<PB N="142" REF="145">vanity, that I knew a certain Tali&s;man, with pro|per figures and characters in&s;crib'd, whereby their great|e&s;t people may be charm'd, brought to re&s;ide with a man, and &s;erve him like a familiar in the conduct of life.</P>
<P>There is no &s;uch thing as fighting among&s;t them, but their controver&s;ies are determin'd by words, where|in they &s;eldom own them&s;elves conquer'd, yet proceed no further than two or three replies: perhaps indeed two others take up their neighbour's quarrel, but then they de&s;i&s;t too after the &s;ame manner; &s;ometimes how|ever, blows have en&s;u'd upon their account, though not among&s;t them: in &s;uch a ca&s;e they have de&s;cended to in&s;pire mankind with their &s;entiments, and cho&s;en champions from among us, in order to decide it.</P>
<P>The time of their life is very different, &s;ome die as &s;oon as born, and others in their youth; &s;ome get a new lea&s;e of life by their entring into the womb again, and if any weather it out to a hundred years, they ge|nerally live on to an extreme age. After which it is remarkable, that in&s;tead of growing weaker as we do, by time, they increa&s;e in &s;trength, and become at la&s;t &s;o confirm'd in health, that it is the opinion of their country, they never can peri&s;h while the world re|mains.</P>
<P>The &s;ickne&s;&s;es which may take them of, be&s;ides what happens from their natural weakne&s;s of body, are of different &s;orts. One is over-moi&s;ture, which affec|ting their man&s;ions; makes them lo&s;e their complexi|ons,
<PB N="143" REF="146">become deform'd, and rot away in&s;en&s;ibly: this is often obviated by their not keeping too much with|in doors. Another is the Worms, which prey upon their bowels: if they be maimed by accidents, they become like us, &s;o far u&s;ele&s;s; and that maim will &s;ome time or other be the occa&s;ion of their ruin. However, they peri&s;h by the&s;e means only in appearance, and like &s;pirits, who vani&s;h in one place, to be &s;een in a|nother. But as men die of pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o Di&s;e&s;teem is what the mo&s;t nearly touches them; then they with|draw into holes and corners, and con&s;ume away in darkne&s;s. Or if they are kept alive a few days by the force of Spices, it is but a &s;hort reprieve from their peri&s;hing to eternity; without any honour, but that in&s;tead of a burial, a &s;mall pyre of Pa&s;t &s;hould be erec|ted over them, while they, like the antient Romans, are reduc'd to a&s;hes.<NOTE PLACE="foot">N.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<PB REF="148">
<P>HAVING &s;ome time ago heard, that the Tran&s;lation of HOMER'S ILIAD would be attempted, I re&s;olv'd to confer with the gentleman who undertook it. I found him of a tall pre&s;ence, and thoughtful countenance, with his hands folded, his eyes fix'd, and his beard untrimm'd. This I took to be a good omen, becau&s;e he thus re&s;embled the Con&s;tantino|politan &s;tatue of Homer which Cedrenus de&s;cribes; and &s;ure|ly nothing cou'd have been liker, had he but arriv'd at the character of age and blindne&s;s. As my bu&s;ine&s;s was to be my introduction, I told him how much I was acquainted with the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of Homer; that no one better knows his own hor&s;e, than I do the camel of Bactria, in which his &s;oul re&s;ided at the time of the Trojan wars; that my acquaintance conti|nued with him, as he appear'd in the per&s;on of the Grecian poet; that I knew him in his next tran&s;migration into a pea|cock; was pleas'd with his return to manhood, under the name of Ennius at Rome; and more pleas'd to hear he wou'd &s;oon revive under another name, with all his full lu&s;tre, in England. This particular knowledge, added I, which &s;prung from the love I bear him, has made me fond of a conver&s;ation with you, in order to the &s;ucce&s;s of your tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>The civil manner in which he received my propo&s;al en|couraging me to proceed, I told him, there were arts of &s;uc|ce&s;s, as well as merits to obtain it; and that he, who now dealt in Greek, &s;hould not only &s;atisfy him&s;elf with being a good Grecian, but al&s;o contrive to ha&s;ten into the repute of it. He might therefore write in the title-page, TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL GREEK, and &s;elect a motto for his purpo&s;e out of the &s;ame language. He might obtain a copy of ver&s;es written in it to prefix to the work; and not call the titles of each book, the fir&s;t, and &s;econd, but ILIAD ALPHA, and BETA. He might retain &s;ome names which the world is lea&s;t acquainted with, as his old tran&s;lator Chapman u&s;es E|phai&s;tus
<PB N="148" REF="149">in&s;tead of Vulcan, Baratrum for Hell; and if the notes were filled with Greek ver&s;es, it wou'd more increa&s;e the wonder of many readers. Thus I went on; when he told me &s;miling, I had &s;hewn him indeed a &s;et of arts very diffe|rent from merit, for which rea&s;on, he thought, he ought not to depend upon them. A &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ays he, founded on the ig|norance of others, may bring a temporary advantage, but nei+ther a con&s;cious &s;atisfaction, nor future fame to the author. Men of &s;en&s;e de&s;pi&s;e the affectation which they ea&s;ily &s;ee through, and even they who were dazzled with it at fir&s;t, are no &s;ooner inform'd of its being an affectation, but they ima|gine it al&s;o a veil to cover imperfection.</P>
<P>The next point I ventur'd to &s;peak on, was the &s;ort of poe|try he intended to u&s;e; how &s;ome may fancy, a poet of the greate&s;t fire would be imitated better in the freedom of blank ver&s;e, and the de&s;cription of war &s;ounds more pompous out of rhime. But, will the tran&s;lation, &s;aid he, be thus remov'd e|nough from pro&s;e, without greater inconveniences? what tran&s;po&s;itions is Milton forc'd to, as an equivalent for want of rhime, in the poetry of a language which depends upon a natural order of words? And even this would not have done his bu&s;ine&s;s, had he not given the fulle&s;t &s;cope to his genius, by chu&s;ing a &s;ubject upon which there could be no hyperboles. We &s;ee (however he be de&s;ervedly &s;ucce&s;sful) that the ridi|cule of his manner &s;ucceeds better than the imitation of it; becau&s;e tran&s;po&s;itions, which are unnatural to a language, are to be fairly derided, if they ruin it by being frequently in|troduced; and becau&s;e hyperboles, which outrage every le&s;|&s;er &s;ubject where they are &s;eriou&s;ly us'd, are often beautiful in ridicule. Let the French, who&s;e language is not copious, tran&s;late in pro&s;e; but ours, which exceeds it in copiou&s;ne&s;s of words, may have a more frequent likene&s;s of &s;ounds, to make the uni&s;on or rhime ea&s;ier; a grace of mu&s;ic, that atones for the har&s;hne&s;s our con&s;onants and mono&s;yllables occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>After this, I demanded what air he would appear with? whether antiquated, like Chapman's Ver&s;ion, or modern, like
<PB N="149" REF="150">La Motte's Contraction. To which he an&s;wer'd, by de&s;iring me to ob&s;erve what a painter does who would always have his pieces in fa&s;hion. He neither chu&s;es to draw a beauty in a ruff, or a French-head; but with its neck uncover'd, and in its natural ornament of hair curl'd up, or &s;pread becoming|ly &s;o may a writer chu&s;e a natural manner of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf which will always be in fa&s;hion, without affecting to borrow an odd &s;olemnity and unintelligible pomp from the pa&s;t times, or humouring the pre&s;ent by falling into its af|fectations, and tho&s;e phra&s;es which are born to die with it.</P>
<P>I a&s;k'd him, la&s;tly, whether he would be &s;trictly literal, or expatiate with further licences? I would not be literal, re|plies he, or ty'd up to line for line in &s;uch a manner wherein it is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s in one language what has been de|liver'd in another. Neither wou'd I &s;o expatiate, as to alter my Author's &s;entiments, or add others of my own. The&s;e errors are to be avoided on either hand, by adhering not only to the word, but the &s;pirit and genius of an author; by con|&s;idering what he means, with what beautiful manner he has expre&s;s'd his meaning in his own tongue, and how he wou'd have expre&s;s'd him&s;elf, had it been in ours. Thus we ought to &s;eek for Homer in a ver&s;ion of Homer: other attempts are but transformations of him; &s;uch as Ovid tells us, where the name is retain'd, and the thing alter'd: this will be really what you mention'd in the compliment you began with, a tran&s;migration of the Poet from one country into another.</P>
<P>Here ended the &s;erious part of our conference. All I re|member further was, that having a&s;k'd him, what he de&s;ign'd with all tho&s;e editions and comments I ob&s;erv'd in his room he made an&s;wer, that if any one, who had a mind to find fault with his performance, wou'd but &s;tay 'till it was entirely fi|ni&s;h'd, he &s;hou'd have a very cheap bargain of them.</P>
<P>Since this di&s;cour&s;e, I have often re&s;olv'd to try what it was to tran&s;late in the &s;pirit of a writer, and at la&s;t, cho&s;e THE BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND MICE, which is a&s;crib'd to Homer; and bears a nearer re&s;emblance, to his Iliad, than
<PB N="150" REF="151">the Culex does to the Acneid of Virgil. Statius and others think it a work of youth, written as a prelude to his greater poems. Chapman thinks it the work of his age, after he found men ungrateful; to &s;hew he cou'd give &s;trength, line|age and fame as he pleas'd, and prai&s;e a Mou&s;e as well as a Man. Thus, &s;ays he, the Poet profe&s;&s;edly flung up the world, and apply'd him&s;elf at la&s;t to hymns. Now, tho' this rea&s;on of his may be nothing more than a &s;cheme form'd out of the order in which Homer's works are printed, yet does the con|jecture that this poem was written after the Iliad, appear probable, becau&s;e of its frequent allu&s;ions to that poem; and particularly that there is not a Frog or a Mou&s;e kill'd, which has not its parallel in&s;tance there, in the death of &s;ome war|rior or other.</P>
<P>The poem it&s;elf is of the Epic kind; the time of its action the duration of two days; the &s;ubject (however its nature fri|volous, or ridiculous) rais'd, by having the mo&s;t &s;hining words and deeds of Gods and Heroes accommodated to it: and while other poems often compare the illu&s;trious exploits of great men to tho&s;e of brutes, this always heightens the &s;ub|ject by compari&s;ons drawn from things above it. We have a great character given it with re&s;pect to the fable in Gaddius de Script non Eccle&s;. It appears, &s;ays he, nearer perfection than the Iliad, or Ody&s;&s;es, and excels both in judgment, wit, and exqui&s;ite texture, &s;ince it is a poem perfect in its own kind. Nor does Cru&s;ius &s;peak le&s;s to its honour, with re&s;pect to the moral, when he cries out in an apo&s;trophe to the reader; <Q>Whoever you are, mind not the names of the&s;e little ani|mals, but look into the things they mean; call them men, call them kings, or coun&s;ellors, or human polity it&s;elf, you have here doctrines of every &s;ort.</Q> And indeed, when I hear the Frog talk concerning the Mou&s;e's family, I learn, e|quality &s;hou'd be ob&s;erv'd in making friend&s;hips; when I hear the Mou&s;e an&s;wer the Frog, I remember, that a &s;imilitude of manners &s;hou'd be regarded in them; when I &s;ee their coun|cils a&s;&s;embling, I think of the bu&s;tles of human prudence:
<PB N="151" REF="152">and when I &s;ee the battle grow warm and glorious, our &s;trug|gles for honour and empire appear before me.</P>
<P>This piece had many imitations of it in antiquity, as the &s;ight of the Cats, the Cranes, the Starlings, the Spiders, &amp;c. That of the Cats is in the Bodleian library, but I was not &s;o lucky as to find it. I have taken the liberty to divide my tran&s;|lation into books (tho' it be otherwi&s;e in the original) accord|ing as the fable allow'd proper re&s;ting-places, by varying its &s;cene, or nature of action: this I did, after the example of Ari&s;tarchus and Zenodotus in the Iliad. I then thought of carrying the grammarians example further, and placing ar|guments at the head of each, which I fram'd as follows, in imitation of the &s;hort ancient Greek in&s;criptions to the Iliad,
<LIST>
<ITEM><LABEL>BOOK I.</LABEL> In ALPHA, the ground Of the quarrel is found.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>BOOK II.</LABEL> In BETA, we The council &s;ee.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>BOOK III.</LABEL> Dire GAMMA relates The work of the fates.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But as I am aver&s;e from all information which le&s;&s;ens our &s;urprize, I only mention the&s;e for a handle to quarrel with the cu&s;tom of long arguments before a poem. It may be nece&s;&s;ary in books of controver&s;y or ab&s;tru&s;e learning, to write an epi|tome before each part; but it is not kind to fore&s;tal us in the work of fancy, and make our attention remi&s;s, by a previous account of the end of it.</P>
<P>The next thing which employ'd my thoughts was the he|roes names. It might perhaps take off &s;omewhat from the maje&s;ty of the poem, had I ca&s;t away &s;uch noble &s;ounds as, Phy&s;ignathus, Lycopinax, and Crambophagus, to &s;ub&s;titute Bluffcheek, Lickdi&s;h and Cabbage-eater in their places. It is for this rea&s;on I have retain'd them untran&s;lated: however, I place them in Engli&s;h before the poem, and &s;ometimes give
<PB N="152" REF="153">a &s;fort character extracted out of their names; as in Poly|phonus, Pternophagus, &amp;c. that the reader may not want &s;ome light of their humour in the original.</P>
<P>But what gave me a greater difficulty was, to know how I &s;hou'd follow the poet, when he in&s;erted pieces of lines from his Iliad, and &s;truck out a &s;prightline&s;s by their new applica|tion. To &s;upply this in my tran&s;lation, I have added one or two of Homer's particularities; and us'd two or three allu&s;i|ons to &s;ome of our Engli&s;h poets who mo&s;t re&s;emble him, to keep up &s;ome image of this &s;pirit of the original with an e|quivalent beauty. To u&s;e more, might make my perfor|mance &s;eem a cento rather than a tran&s;lation, to tho&s;e who know not the nece&s;&s;ity I lay under.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant, after all my care, how the world re|ceives the be&s;t compo&s;itions of this nature. A man need only go to a painter's, and apply what he hears &s;aid of a pic|ture to a tran&s;lation, to find how he &s;hall be us'd upon his own, or his author's account. There one &s;pectator tells you, a piece is extremely fine, but he &s;ets no value on what is not like the face it was drawn for; while a &s;econd informs you, &s;uch another is extremely like, but he cares not for a piece of deformity, tho' its likene&s;s be never &s;o exact.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding all which happens to the be&s;t, when I tran&s;late, I have a de&s;ire to be reckon'd among&s;t them; and I &s;hall obtain this, if the world will be &s;o good-natur'd as to believe writers that give their own characters: upon which pre&s;umption, I an&s;wer to all objections beforehand, as follows:</P>
<P>When I am literal, I regard my author's words; when I am not, I tran&s;late in his &s;pirit. If I am low, I chu&s;e the nar|rative &s;tyle; if high, the &s;ubject requir'd it. When I am e|nervate, I give an in&s;tance of ancient &s;implicity; when affec|ted, I &s;how a point of modern delicacy. As for beauties, there never can be one found in me which was not really intended; and for any faults, they proceeded from too unbounded fan|cy, or too nice judgment, but by no means from any defect in either of tho&s;e faculties.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF ZOILUS.</HEAD>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THEY who have di&s;cours'd concerning the na|ture and extent of critici&s;m, take notice, that editions of authors, the interpretations of them, and the judgment which is pa&s;s'd upon each, are the three branches into which the art divides it&s;elf. But the la&s;t of the&s;e, that directs in the choice of books, and takes care to prepare us for reading them, is by the learned Bacon call'd the Chair of the Critics. In this chair (to carry on the figure) have &s;ate Ari&s;totle, De|metrius Phaleraeus, Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;en&s;is, Ci|cero, Horace, Quintilian, and Longinus; all great names of antiquity, the cen&s;ors of tho&s;e ages which went before, and the directors of tho&s;e that come after them, with re&s;pect to the natural and per&s;picuous man|ners of thought and a expre&s;&s;ion, by which a correct and
<PB N="154" REF="155">judicious genius may be able to write for the plea&s;ure and profit of mankind.</P>
<P>But whatever has been advanc'd by men really great in them&s;elves, has been al&s;o attempted by others of capacities either unequal to the undertaking, or which have been corrupted by their pa&s;&s;ions, and drawn away into partial violences: &s;o that we have &s;ometimes &s;een the province of Critici&s;m u&s;urp'd, by &s;uch who judge with an ob&s;cure diligence, and a cer|tain dryne&s;s of under&s;tanding, incapable of compre|hending a figurative &s;tile, or being mov'd by the beau|ties of imagination; and at other times by &s;uch, who&s;e natural moro&s;ene&s;s in general, or particular de&s;igns of envy, has render'd them indefatigable again&s;t the repu|tation of others.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t manner is ZOILUS repre&s;ented to us by antiquity, and with a character &s;o abandon'd, that his name has been &s;ince made u&s;e of to brand all &s;ucceed|ing critics of his complexion. He has a load of in|famy thrown upon him, great, in proportion to the fame of HOMER, again&s;t whom he oppos'd him&s;elf: if the one was e&s;teem'd as the very re&s;idence of wit, the other is de&s;crib'd as a profligate, who wou'd de&s;troy the temple of Apollo and the Mu&s;es, in order to have his memory pre&s;erv'd by the envious action. I imagine it maybe no ungrateful undertaking to write &s;ome ac|count of this celebrated per&s;on, from whom &s;o many derive their character; and I think the life of a Cri|tic
<PB N="155" REF="156">is not un&s;ea&s;onably put before the works of his Poet, e&s;pecially when his cen&s;ures accompany him. If what he advances be ju&s;t, he &s;tands here as a cen&s;or; if otherwi&s;e, he appears as an addition to the poet's fame, and is placed before him with the ju&s;tice of an|tiquity in its &s;acrifices, when, becau&s;e &s;uch a bea&s;t had offended &s;uch a deity, he was brought annually to his altar to be &s;lain upon it.</P>
<P>ZOILUS us was born at Amphipolis a city of Thrace, during the time in which the Macedonian empire flou|ri&s;h'd. Who his parents were, is not certainly known; but if the appellation of Thracian Slave, which the world apply'd to him, be not merely an expre&s;&s;ion of contempt, it proves him of mean extraction. He was a di&s;ciple of one Polycrates a &s;ophi&s;t, who had di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd him&s;elf by writing again&s;t the great names of the ages before him; and who, when he is mention'd as his ma&s;ter, is &s;aid to be particularly famous for a bitter accu&s;ation or invective again&s;t the memory of Socrates. In this manner is ZOILUS &s;et out to po&s;te|rity, like a plant naturally baneful, and having its poi|&s;on render'd more acute and &s;ubtle by a preparation.</P>
<P>In his per&s;on he was tall and meagre, his comple|xion was pale, and all the motions of his face were &s;harp. He is repre&s;ented by Aelian, with a beard nou|ri&s;h'd to a prodigious length, and his head kept clo&s;e &s;hav'd, to give him a magi&s;terial appearance: his coat hung over his knees in a &s;lovenly fa&s;hion; his man|ners
<PB N="156" REF="157">were form'd upon an aver&s;ion to the cu&s;toms of the world. He was fond of &s;peaking ill, diligent to &s;ow di&s;&s;en&s;ion, and from the con&s;tant bent of his thought, had obtain'd that &s;ort of readine&s;s for &s;lander or re|proach, which is e&s;teem'd wit by the light opinion of &s;ome, who take the remarks of ill-nature, for an un|der&s;tanding of mankind, and the abrupt la&s;hes of rude|ne&s;s for the &s;pirit of expre&s;&s;ion. This, at la&s;t, grew to &s;uch a height in him, that he became carele&s;s of con|cealing it; he threw off all re&s;erves and managements in re&s;pect of others, and the pa&s;&s;ion &s;o far took the turn of a frenzy, that being one day ask'd, why he &s;poke ill of every one? <Q>It is (&s;ays he) becau&s;e I am not able to do them ill, tho' I have &s;o great a mind to it.</Q> Such extravagant declarations of his general enmity made men deal with him as with the creature he affected to be; they no more &s;poke of him as be|longing to the &s;pecies he hated; and from henceforth his learned &s;peeches or fine remarks cou'd obtain no other title for him, but that of THE RHETORICAL DOG.</P>
<P>While he was in Macedon he employ'd his time in writing, and reciting what he had written in the &s;chools of &s;ophi&s;ts. His oratory (&s;ays Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;|&s;en&s;is) was always of the demon&s;trative kind, which concerns it&s;elf about prai&s;e or di&s;prai&s;e. His &s;ubjects were the mo&s;t approv'd authors, whom he cho&s;e to a|bu&s;e upon the account of their reputation; and to
<PB N="157" REF="158">whom, without going round the matter in faint prai&s;es or artificial in&s;inuations, he us'd to deny their own characteri&s;tics. With this gallantry of oppo&s;ition did he cen&s;ure Xenophon for affectation, Plato for vulgar notions, and I&s;ocrates for incorrectne&s;s. Demo&s;the|nes, in his opinion, wanted fire, Ari&s;totle &s;ubtilty, and Ari&s;tophanes humour. But, as to have reputation was with him a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of enmity, &s;o to have that reputation univer&s;al, was what wrought his frenzy to its wilde&s;t degree; for which rea&s;on it was HOMER with whom he was mo&s;t implacably angry. And cer|tainly, if envy choo&s;e its object for the power to give torment, it &s;hou'd here (if ever) have the glory of ful|ly an&s;wering its intentions; for the Poet was &s;o wor|&s;hip'd by the whole age, that his Critic had not the common alleviation of the opinion of one other man, to concur in his condemnation.</P>
<P>ZOILUS however went on with indefatigable indu&s;|try in a voluminous work, which he intitled, THE <GAP DESC="foreign">, or CENSURE OF HOMER: 'till having at la&s;t fini&s;h'd it, he prepares to &s;end it into the world with a pompous title at the head, invented for him&s;elf by way of excel|lency, and thus in&s;erted after the manner of the anci|ents.</P>
<Q>ZOILUS, the &s;courge of HOMER, writ this again&s;t that lover of fables.</Q>
<P>Thus did he value him&s;elf upon a work, which the world has not thought worth tran&s;mitting to us, and
<PB N="158" REF="159">but ju&s;t left a &s;pecimen in five or &s;ix quotations, which happen to be pre&s;erv'd by the commentators of that Poet again&s;t whom he writ it. If any one be fond to form a judgment upon him from the&s;e in&s;tances, they are as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>IL. 1. He &s;ays, HOMER is very ridiculous (a word he was noted to apply to him) when he makes &s;uch a God as APOLLO employ him&s;elf in killing dogs and mules.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IL. 5. HOMER is very ridiculous in de&s;cribing DIO|MEDES' helmet and armour, as &s;parkling, and in a blaze of fire about him; for then why was he not burn'd by it?</ITEM>
<ITEM>IL. 5. When IDAEUS quitted his fine chariot, which was entangl'd in the fight, and for which he might have been &s;lain, the Poet was a fool for making him leave his chariot, he had better have run away in it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IL. 24. When ACHILLES makes PRIAM lie out of his tent, le&s;t the Greeks &s;hou'd hear of his being there, the Poet had no breeding, to turn a king out in that manner.</ITEM>
<ITEM>OD. 9. The Poet &s;ays, ULYSSES lo&s;t an equal num|ber out of each &s;hip. The Critic &s;ays, that's impo&s;|&s;ible.</ITEM>
<ITEM>OD. 10. He derides the men who were turn'd into &s;wine, and calls them HOMER'S poor little blubbering pigs. The fir&s;t five of the&s;e remarks are found in DI|DYMUS, the la&s;t in LONGINUS.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="160">Such as the&s;e are the cold je&s;ts and trifling quar|rels, which have been regi&s;tred from a compo&s;ition, that (according to the repre&s;entation handed down to us) was born in envy, liv'd a &s;hort life in contempt, and lies for ever bury'd with infamy.</P>
<P>But, as his de&s;ign was judg'd by him&s;elf wonder|fully well accompli&s;h'd, Macedon began to be e&s;teem'd a &s;tage too narrow for his glory; and Egypt, which had then taken learning into its patronage, the proper place where it ought to diffu&s;e its beams, to the &s;ur|prize of all whom he wou'd per&s;uade to reckon them|&s;elves hitherto in the dark, and under the prejudices of a fal&s;e admiration. However, as he had prepar'd him&s;elf for the journey, he was &s;uddenly diverted for a while by the rumour of the Olympic games, which were at that time to be celebrated. Thither he &s;teer'd his cour&s;e, full of the memory of Herodotus, and o|thers who had &s;ucce&s;sfully recited in that large a&s;&s;em|bly; and pleas'd to imagine he &s;hou'd alter all Greece in their notions of wit before he left it.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival, he found the field in its prepara|tion for diver&s;ion. The chariots &s;tood for the race, carv'd and gilded, the hor&s;es were led in co&s;tly trap|pings, &s;ome practis'd to wre&s;tle, &s;ome to dart the &s;pear, (or whatever they de&s;ign'd to engage at) in a kind of flouri&s;h beforehand: others were looking on, to amu&s;e them&s;elves; and all gaily dre&s;s'd, according to the cu&s;|tom of tho&s;e places. Through the&s;e did ZOITUS move
<PB N="160" REF="161">forward, bald-headed, bearded to the middle, its a long &s;ad-colour'd ve&s;tment, and inflexibly &s;tretching forth his hands fill'd with volumes roll'd up to a va&s;t thick|ne&s;s: a figure mo&s;t venerably &s;lovenly! able to de|mand attention upon account of its oddne&s;s. And in|deed, he had no &s;ooner fix'd him&s;elf upon an eminence, but a crowd flock'd about him to know what he in|tended. Then the Critic ca&s;ting his eyes on the ring, open'd his volume &s;lowly, as con&s;idering with what part be might mo&s;t properly entertain his audience. It happen'd, that the games at Patroclus' ob&s;equies came fir&s;t into his thought; whether it was that he judg'd it &s;uitable to the place, or knew that he had fall'n as well upon the games them&s;elves, as upon HOMER for celebrating them, and cou'd not re&s;i&s;t his natural di&s;po|&s;ition to give mankind offence. Every one was now intently fa&s;ten'd upon him, while he undertook to prove, that tho&s;e games &s;ignify'd nothing to the taking of Troy, and therefore only furni&s;h'd an impertinent Epi&s;ode: that the fall of the le&s;&s;er Ajax in cow-dung, the &s;quabble of the chariot-race, and other accidents which attend &s;uch &s;ports, are mean or trifling: and a world of other remarks, for which he &s;till affirm'd HOMER to be a fool, and which they that heard him took for &s;tudy'd invectives again&s;t tho&s;e exerci&s;es they were then employ'd in. Men who frequent &s;ports, as they are of a chearful di&s;po&s;tion, &s;o are they lovers of poetry: this, together with the opinion they were af|fronted,
<PB N="161" REF="162">wrought them up to impatience and further licences: there was particularly a young Athenian gentleman, who was to run three chariots in tho&s;e games, who being an admirer of HOMER, could no longer contain him&s;elf, but cry'd out, <Q>What in the name of CASTOR have we here, ZOILUS from Thrace?</Q> and as he &s;aid it, &s;truck him with a chariot-whip. Immediately then a hundred whips were &s;een curling round his head; &s;o that his face, natural|ly deform'd, and heighten'd by pain to its utmo&s;t Ca|ricatura, appear'd in the mid&s;t of them, as we may fancy the vi&s;age of Envy, if at any time her &s;nakes ri&s;e in rebellion to la&s;h their mi&s;tre&s;s. Nor was this all the puni&s;hment they decreed him, when once they imagin'd he was ZOILUS: the Scyronian rocks were near 'em, and thither they hurried him with a general cry, to that &s;peedy ju&s;tice which is practis'd at places of diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is here, that, according to SUIDAS, the critic ex|pir'd. But we following the more numerous te&s;timo|nies of other authors, conclude he e&s;cap'd either by the lowne&s;s of tho&s;e rocks whence he was thru&s;t, or by bu&s;hes which might break his fall; and &s;oon after following the cour&s;es of his fir&s;t intention, he &s;et &s;ail for Egypt.</P>
<P>Egypt was at this time govern'd by Ptolemy Phi|ladelphus, a prince pa&s;&s;ionately fond of learning, and learned men; particularly an admirer of HOMER, to
<PB N="162" REF="163">adoration. He had built the fine&s;t library in the world, and made the choice&s;t, as well as mo&s;t numerous col|lection of books. No encouragements were wanting from him to allure men of the brighte&s;t genius to his court, and no time thought too much which he &s;pent in their company. From hence it is that we hear of ERATOSTHENES and ARISTOPHANES, tho&s;e univer|&s;al &s;cholars, and candid judges of other mens perfor|mances: CALLIMACHUS, a poet of the mo&s;t ea&s;y, courteous delicacy, famous for a poem on the cutting of Berenice's hair, and whom OVID &s;o much admired as to &s;ay, <Q>It was rea&s;on enough for him to love a woman, if &s;he would but tell him he exceeded CAL|LIMACHUS;</Q> THEOCRITUS, the mo&s;t famous in the pa&s;toral way of writing; and among the young men, ARISTARCHUS and APOLLONIUS RHODIUS, the one of whom prov'd a mo&s;t judicious critic, the other a poet of no mean character.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many more fill'd the court of that mu|nificent prince, who&s;e liberal di&s;pen&s;ations of wealth and favour became encouragements to every one to exert their parts to the utmo&s;t; like &s;treams which flow through different &s;orts of &s;oils, and improve each in that for which it was adapted by nature.</P>
<P>Such was the court when ZOILUS arriv'd; but be|fore he enter'd Alexandria, he &s;pent a night in the temple of I&s;is, to enquire of the &s;ucce&s;s of his under|taking; not that he doubted the worth of his works,
<PB N="163" REF="164">but his late misfortune had in&s;tructed him, that others might be ignorant of it. Having therefore perform'd the accu&s;tom'd &s;acrifice, and compos'd him&s;elf to re&s;t upon the hide, he had a vi&s;ion which foretold of his future fame.</P>
<P>He found him&s;elf &s;itting under the &s;hade of a dark yew, which was cover'd with hellebore and hemlock, and near the mouth of a cave, where &s;at a mon&s;ter, pale, wa&s;ted, &s;urrounded with &s;nakes, fo&s;t'ring a cocka|trice in her bo&s;om; and cur&s;ing the &s;un, for making the work of the deities appear in its beauty. The &s;ight of this bred fear in him; when &s;he &s;ubddenly turn|ing her &s;unk eyes, put on a hideous kind of a loving grin, in which he di&s;cover'd a re&s;emblance to &s;ome of his own features. Then turning up her &s;nakes, and interlacing them in the form of a turbant, to give him le&s;s di&s;gu&s;t, thus &s;he addre&s;s'd her&s;elf: <Q>Go on, my &s;on, in whom I am renew'd, and pro&s;per in thy brave undertakings on mankind: a&s;&s;ert their wit to be dulne&s;s; prove their &s;en&s;e to be folly; know truth only when it is on thy own &s;ide; and acknow|ledge learning at no other time to be u&s;eful. Spare not an author of any rank or &s;ize; let not thy tongue or pen know pity; make the living feel thy accu&s;a|tions; make the gho&s;ts of the dead groan in their tombs for their violated fame. But why do I &s;pend time in needle&s;s advice, which may be better u&s;ed in encouragement? Let thy eyes delight them&s;elves with
<PB N="164" REF="165">the future recompence which I have re&s;erv'd for thy merit.</Q> Thus &s;poke the mon&s;ter, and &s;hriek'd the name of ZOILUS: the &s;hades, who were to bear the &s;ame name after him, became obedient; and the mouth of the cave was fill'd with &s;trange &s;upercilious counte|nances, which all crowded to make their appearance. The&s;e began to march before him with an imitation of his mien and manners: &s;ome crowned with wild &s;or|rel, others having leaves of dead bays mingled among&s;t it; whil&s;t the mon&s;ter &s;till de&s;crib'd them as he pa&s;s'd, and touch'd each with a livid track of malignant light, that &s;hot from her eye, to point where &s;he meant the de&s;cription. <Q>They (&s;ays &s;he) in the chaplets of wild &s;orrel, are my writers of pro&s;e, who erect &s;candal into critici&s;m: they who wear the wither'd bay with it, are &s;uch who write poems, which are profe&s;&s;ed|ly to an&s;wer all rules, and be left for patterns to men of genius. The&s;e that follow &s;hall attack others, becau&s;e they are excell'd by them. The next rank &s;hall make an author's being read, a &s;ufficient ground of oppo&s;ition. Here march my grammarians, &s;kill'd to torture words; there my &s;ons of &s;ophi&s;try, ever ready to wre&s;t a meaning. Ob&s;erve how faint the foremo&s;t of the proce&s;&s;ion appear; and how they are now lo&s;t in yonder mi&s;ts, which roll about the cave of oblivion! this &s;hews, it is not for them|&s;elves that they are to be known; the world will con&s;ider them only as managing a part of thy en|dowments,
<PB N="165" REF="166">and &s;o know them by thy name while they live, that their own &s;hall be lo&s;t for ever. But &s;ee how my cave &s;till &s;warms! how every age pro|duces men, upon whom the pre&s;ervation of thy me|mory devolves. My darling, the fates have decreed it! thou art ZOILUS, and ZOILUS &s;hall be eternal. Come, my &s;erpents, applaud him with your hi&s;&s;es, that is all which now can be done; in modern times, my &s;ons &s;hall invent louder in&s;truments, and artificial imitations; noi&s;es which drown the voice of merit, &s;hall furni&s;h a concert to delight them.</Q> Here &s;he aro&s;e to cla&s;p him in her arms, a &s;trange noi&s;e was heard, the critic &s;tarted at it, and his vi&s;ion for|&s;ook him.</P>
<P>It was with &s;ome confu&s;ion, that he lay mu&s;ing a while upon what he had &s;een; but reflecting, that the Godde&s;s had given him no an&s;wer concerning his &s;uc|ce&s;s in Egypt, he &s;trengthen'd his heart in his ancient &s;elf-love and enmity to others, and took all for an idle dream born of the fumes of indige&s;tion, or produc'd by the dizzy motion of his voyage. In this opinion, he told it at his departure to the prie&s;t, who admiring the extraordinary relation, regi&s;tred it in hieroglyphics at Canopus.</P>
<P>The day when he came to Alexandria was one on which the king had appointed games to APOLLO and the MUSES, and honours and rewards for &s;uch writers as &s;hou'd appear in them. This he took for a happy
<PB N="166" REF="167">omen at his entrance, and, not to lo&s;e an opportunity of &s;hewing him&s;elf, repair'd immediately to the public theatre; where, as if every thing was to favour him, the very fir&s;t accident gave his &s;pleen a diver&s;ion, which we find at large in the proem of the &s;eventh book of VITRUVIUS. It happen'd that when the poets had re|cited, &s;ix of the judges decreed the prizes with a full ap|probation of all the audience. From this, Ari&s;topha|nes alone di&s;&s;ented, and demanded the fir&s;t prize for a per&s;on who&s;e ba&s;hful and interrupted manner of &s;peaking made him appear the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful: for he (&s;ays the judge) is alone a poet, and all the re&s;t re|citers; and they who are judges, &s;hou'd not approve thefts, but writings. To maintain his a&s;&s;ertion, tho&s;e volumes were produc'd from whence they had been &s;toll'n: upon which, the king order'd them to be for|mally try'd for theft, and di&s;mi&s;s'd with infamy; but placed Ari&s;tophanes over his library, as one, who had given a proof of his knowledge in books. This pa&s;|&s;age ZOILUS often afterwards repeated with plea&s;ure, for the number of di&s;graces which happen'd in it to the pretenders in poetry; tho' his envy made him &s;till careful not to name Ari&s;tophanes, but a judge in ge|neral.</P>
<P>However, critici&s;m had only a &s;hort triumph over poetry, when he made the next turn his own, by &s;tep|ping forward into the place of reciting. Here he im|mediately rais'd the curio&s;ity, and drew the attention
<PB N="167" REF="168">of both king and people: but, as it happen'd, neither the one nor the other la&s;ted; for the fir&s;t &s;entence where he had regi&s;tred his own name, &s;atisfied their cu|rio&s;ity; and the next, where he offer'd to prove to a court &s;o devoted to HOMER, that he was ridiculous in every thing; went near to fini&s;h his audience. He was neverthele&s;s heard quietly for &s;ome time, till the king &s;eeing no end of his abu&s;ing the prince of philological learning, (as Vitruvius words it) departed in di&s;dain. The judges follow'd, deriding his attempt as an ex|travagance which cou'd not demand their gravity; and the people taking a licence from the precedent, hooted him away with obloquy and indignation. Thus ZOILUS fail'd at his fir&s;t appearance, and was forc'd to retire, &s;tung with a mo&s;t impatient &s;en&s;e of public contempt.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, he did not omit his attendance at court on the day following, with a peti|tion that he might be put upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment of learning, and allow'd a pen&s;ion. This the king read, but return'd no an&s;wer: &s;o great was the &s;corn he conceiv'd again&s;t him. But ZOILUS &s;till undauntedly renew'd his petitions, 'till PTOLEMY, being weary of his per&s;ecution, gave him a flat denial. HOMER, (&s;ays the prince) who has been dead the&s;e thou&s;and years, has maintain'd thou&s;ands of people; and ZOILUS, who boa&s;ts he has more wit than he, ought not only to maintain him&s;elf, but many others al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169">His petitions being thrown carele&s;ly about, were fall'n into the hands of men of wit, whom, according to his cu&s;tom, he had provok'd, and whom it is un&s;afe to provoke if you wou'd live unexpos'd. I can com|pare them to nothing more properly, than to the Bee, a creature wing'd and lively, fond to rove through the choice&s;t flowers of nature, and ble&s;t at home among the &s;weets of its own compo&s;ition: not ill-natur'd, yet quick to revenge an injury; not wearing its &s;ting out of the &s;heath; yet able to wound more &s;orely than its appearance would threaten. Now the&s;e being made per&s;onal enemies by his malicious expre&s;&s;ions, the court rung with petitions of ZOILUS tran&s;vers'd; new peti|tions drawn up for him; catalogues of his merits, &s;up|pos'd to be collected by him&s;elf; his complaints of man's inju&s;tice &s;et to a harp out of tune, and a hundred other &s;ports of fancy, with which their epigrams play'd upon him. The&s;e were the ways of writing which ZOILUS hated, becau&s;e they were not only read, but retain'd ea&s;ily, by rea&s;on of their &s;pirit, humour, and brevity; and becau&s;e they not only make the man a je&s;t upon whom they are written, but a farther je&s;t, if he attempt to an&s;wer them gravely. However, he did what he cou'd in revenge, he endeavour'd to &s;et tho&s;e whom he envy'd at variance among them&s;elves, and invented lyes to promote his de&s;ign. He told Erato&s;|thenes, that Callimachus &s;aid, his extent of learning con&s;i&s;ted but in a &s;uperficial knowledge of the &s;ciences;
<PB N="169" REF="170">and whi&s;per'd Callimachus, that Erato&s;thenes only al|low'd him to have an artful habitual knack of ver&s;ify|ing. He would have made Ari&s;tophanes believe, that Theocritus rally'd his knowledge in editions, as a cu|rious kind of trifling; and Theocritus, that Ari&s;to|phanes derided the ru&s;tical &s;implicity of his &s;hepherds. Tho' of all his &s;tories, that which be mo&s;t valu'd him|&s;elf for, was his con&s;tant report, that every one whom he hated was a friend to ANTIOCHUS king of Syria, the enemy of PTOLEMY.</P>
<P>But malice is un&s;ucce&s;sful when the character of its agent is known: they grew more friends to one ano|ther, by imagining, that even what had been &s;aid, as well as what had not, was all of ZOILUS'S invention; and as he grew more and more the common je&s;t, their deri&s;ion of him became a kind of life and cement to their conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Contempt, poverty, and other misfortunes had now &s;o a&s;&s;aulted him, that even they who abhorr'd his tem|per, contributed &s;omething to his &s;upport, in common humanity. Yet &s;till his envy, like a vitiated &s;tomach, converted every kindne&s;s to the nouri&s;hment of his di&s;|ea&s;e; and 'twas the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of his life to revile HOMER, and tho&s;e by whom he him&s;elf &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. In this humour he had days, which were &s;o given up to impatient ill-nature, that he could neither write any thing, nor conver&s;e with anyone. The&s;e he &s;ometimes employ'd in throwing &s;tones at children; which was
<PB N="170" REF="171">once &s;o unhappily return'd upon him, that he was ta|ken up for dead: and this occa&s;ion'd the report in &s;ome authors, of his being &s;toned to death in Egypt. Or, &s;ometimes he convey'd him&s;elf into the library, where he blotted the name of HOMER wherever he could meet it, and tore the be&s;t editions of &s;everal volumes; for which the librarians debarr'd him the privilege of that place. The&s;e and other mi&s;chiefs made him univer&s;al|ly &s;hunn'd; nay, to &s;uch an extravagance was his cha|racter of envy carry'd, that the more &s;uper&s;titious E|gyptians imagin'd they were fa&s;cinated by him, if the day were darker, or them&s;elves a little heavier than ordinary; &s;ome wore &s;prigs of rue, by way of preven|tion; and others, rings made of the hoof of a wild a&s;s for amulets, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;uffer, by his fixing an eye upon them.</P>
<P>It was now near the time, when that &s;plendid temple which PTOLEMY built in honour of HOMER, was to be open'd with a &s;olemn magnificence: for this the men of genius were employ'd in finding a proper pageant. At la&s;t, they agreed by one con&s;ent, to have ZOILUS, the utter enemy of HOMER, hang'd in effigy; and the day being come, it was on this manner they form'd the proce&s;&s;ion. Twelve beautiful boys, lightly habited in white, with purple wings repre&s;enting the HOURS, went on the foremo&s;t: after the&s;e, came a chariot ex|ceeding high and &s;tately, where &s;at one repre&s;enting APOLLO; with another at his feet, who in thig pomp
<PB N="171" REF="172">&s;u&s;tain'd the per&s;on of HOMER: Apollo's laurel had little gilded points, like the appearance of rays between its leaves; HOMER's was bound with a blue &s;illet, like that which is worn by the prie&s;ts of the Deity: Apollo was di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the golden harp he bore; Homer, by a volume, richly beautify'd with horns of inlaid ivo|ry, and ta&s;&s;els of &s;ilver depending from them. Behind the&s;e came three chariots, in which rode nine dam&s;els, each of them with that in&s;trument which is proper to each of the Mu&s;es; among whom, CALLIOPE, to give her the honour of the day, &s;ate in the middle of the &s;econd chariot, known by her richer ve&s;tments. Af|ter the&s;e march'd a &s;olemn train aptly habited, like tho&s;e &s;ciences which acknowledge their ri&s;e or improve|ment from this Poet. Then the men of learning who attended the court, with wreaths, and rods or &s;cepters of laurel, as taking upon them&s;elves the repre&s;entation of Rhap&s;odi&s;ts, to do honour, for the time, to HOMER. In the rear of all was &s;lowly drawn along an odd car|riage, rather than a chariot, which had its &s;ides art|fully turn'd, and carv'd &s;o as to bear a re&s;emblance to the heads of &s;narling ma&s;tiffs. In this was borne, as led in triumph, a tall image of deformity, who&s;e head was bald, and wound about with nettles for a chaplet. The tongue lay lolling out, to &s;hew a contempt of man|kind, and was fork'd at the end, to confe&s;s its love to detraction. The hands were manacled behind, and the fingers arm'd with long nails, to cut deep through
<PB N="172" REF="173">the margins of authors. Its ve&s;ture was of the paper of Nilus, bearing in&s;crib'd upon its brea&s;t in capital letters, ZOILUS THE HOMERO-MASTIX; and all the re&s;t of it was &s;crawl'd with various mon&s;ters of that river, as emblems of tho&s;e productions with which that critic us'd to fill his papers. When they had reach'd the temple, where the king and his court were already plac'd to behold them from its galleries, the image of ZOILUS was hung upon a gibbet, there erected for it, with &s;uch loud acclamations as witne&s;s'd the people's &s;atisfaction. This being fini&s;h'd, the HOURS knock'd at the gates; which flew open, and di&s;cover'd the &s;tatue of HOMER magnificently &s;eated, with the pictures of tho&s;e cities which contended for his birth, rang'd in order around him. Then they who repre&s;ented the Deities in the proce&s;&s;ion, laying a&s;ide their en&s;igns of divinity, u&s;her'd in the men of learning with a &s;ound of voices, and their various in&s;truments, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at a &s;acrifice in honour of APOLLO and his favourite HOMER.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily believ'd, that ZOILUS concluded his affairs were at the utmo&s;t point of de&s;peration in Egypt; wherefore, fill'd with pride, &s;corn, anger, vexa|tion, envy, (and whatever cou'd torment him) except the knowledge of his unworthine&s;s) he flung him&s;elf a|board the fir&s;t &s;hip which left that country. As it hap|pen'd, the ve&s;&s;el he &s;ail'd in was bound for A&s;ia Minor, and this landing him at a port the neare&s;t to Smyrna, he was &agrave; little pleas'd amid&s;t his mi&s;ery to think of de|crying
<PB N="173" REF="174">HOMER in another place where he was ador'd, and which chiefly pretended to his birth. So incorri|gible was his di&s;po&s;ition; that no experience taught him anything which might contribute to his ea&s;e and &s;afety.</P>
<P>And as his experience wrought nothing on him, &s;o neither did the accidents, which the opinion of tho&s;e times took for ominous warnings: for, he is reported to have &s;een, the night he came to Smyrna, a venerable per&s;on, &s;uch as HOMER is de&s;cribed by antiquity, threatning him in a dream; and in the morning he found a part of his works gnaw'd by Mice, which, &s;ays Aelian, are of all bea&s;ts the mo&s;t prophetic; in&s;omuch. that they know when to leave a hou&s;e, even before its fall is &s;u&s;pected. Envy, which has no relaxation, &s;till hurry'd him forward; for it is certainly true that a man has not firmer re&s;olution from rea&s;on, to &s;tand by a good principle, than ob&s;tinacy from perverted nature, to adhere to a bad one.</P>
<P>In the morning as he walk'd the &s;treet, he ob&s;erv'd in &s;ome plates in&s;criptions concerning HOMER, which inform'd him where he liv'd, where he had taught &s;chool, and &s;everal other particularities which the Smyr|neans glory to have recorded of him; all which awa|ken'd and irritated the pa&s;&s;ions of ZOILUS. But hit temper was quite overthrown, by the venerable ap|pearance which he &s;aw, upon entring the Homereum: which is a building compos'd of a library, porch, and temple erected to HOMER. Here a phrenzy &s;eited him
<PB N="174" REF="175">which knew no bounds; he rav'd violently again&s;t the Poet, and all his admirers; he trampled on his works, he &s;purn'd about his commentators, he tore down his bu&s;ts from the niches, threw the medals that were ca&s;t of him out of the windows, and pa&s;&s;ing from one place to another, beat the aged prie&s;ts, and broke down the altar. The cries which were occa&s;ioned by this means brought in many upon him; who ob&s;erv'd with horror how the mo&s;t &s;acred honours of their city were pro|phan'd by the frantic impiety of a &s;tranger; and im|mediately dragg'd him to puni&s;hment before their ma|gi&s;trates, who were then &s;itting. He was no &s;ooner there, but known for ZOILUS by &s;ome in court, a name a long time mo&s;t hateful to Smyrna; which, as it valu'd it&s;elf upon the birth of HOMER, &s;o bore more impatiently than other places, the abu&s;es offer'd him. This made them eager to propitiate his &s;hade, and claim to them&s;elves a &s;econd merit by the death of ZOILUS; wherefore they &s;entenc'd him to &s;uller by fire, as the due reward of his de&s;ecrations; and order'd, that their city &s;hou'd be purify'd by a lu&s;tration, for having entertain'd &s;o impious a gue&s;t. In pur&s;uance to this &s;entence, he was led away with his compo&s;i|tions born before him by the public executioner: then was he fa&s;ten'd to the &s;take, prophe&s;ying all the while how many &s;hou'd ari&s;e to revenge his quarrel; parti|cularly, that when Greek &s;hou'd be no more a lan|guage, there &s;hall be a Nation which will both tran&s;|late
<PB N="175" REF="176">HOMER into Pro&s;e, and contract him in Ver&s;e. At la&s;t, his compo&s;itions were lighted to &s;et the pile on fire, and he expir'd &s;ighing for the lo&s;s of them, more than for the pain he &s;uffer'd: and perhaps too, be|cau&s;e he might fore&s;ee in his prophetic rapture, that there &s;hou'd ari&s;e a poet in another nation, able to do HOMER ju&s;tice, and make him known among&s;t his people to future ages.</P>
<P>Thus dy'd this noted critic, of whom we may ob|&s;erve from the cour&s;e of the hi&s;tory, that as &s;everal ci|ties contended for the honour of the birth of HOMER, &s;o &s;everal have contended for the honour of the death of ZOILUS. With him likewi&s;e peri&s;h'd his great work on the ILIAD, and the ODYSSE; concerning which we ob&s;erve al&s;o, that as the known worth of HOMER'S poetry makes him &s;urvive him&s;elf with glory; &s;o the bare memory of ZOILUS'S critici&s;m makes him &s;ur|vive him&s;elf with infamy. The&s;e are de&s;ervedly the con&s;equences of that Ill-nature which made him fond of detraction; that Envy, which made him choo&s;e &s;o excellent a character for its object; and tho&s;e partial Methods of Inju&s;tice, with which he treated the object he had cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Yet how many commence critics after him, upon the &s;ame unhappy principles? How many labour to de&s;troy the monuments of the dead, and &s;ummon up the great from their graves to an&s;wer for trifles before them? how many, by mi&s;repre&s;entations, both hinder the world
<PB N="176" REF="177">from favouring men of genius, and di&s;courage them in them&s;elves; like boughs of a baneful and barren nature, that &s;hoot a-cro&s;s a fruit-tree; at once to &s;creen the &s;un from it, and hinder it by their droppings from producing any thing of value? but if the&s;e who thus follow ZOILUS, meet not the &s;ame &s;everities of fate, becau&s;e they come &s;hort of his indefatigablene&s;s, or their object is not &s;o univer&s;ally the concern of man|kind; they &s;hall neverthele&s;s meet a proportion of it in the inward trouble they give them&s;elves, and the outward contempt others fling upon them: a puni&s;h|ment which every one has hitherto felt, who has real|ly de&s;erv'd to be call'd a ZOILUS; and which will al|ways be the natural reward of &s;uch mens actions, as long as ZOILUS is the proper name of Envy.</P>

<P>I MUST do my Reader the ju&s;tice, before I enter upon the&s;e NOTES of ZOILUS, to inform him, that I have not in any author met this work a&s;crib'd to him by its title, which has made me not mention it in the LIFE. But thus much in general appears, that he wrote &s;everal things be&s;ides his cen&s;ure on the ILIAD, which, as it gives ground for this opinion, encourages me to offer an account of the Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>Being acquainted with a grave gentleman who &s;earches after Editions, purcha&s;es Manu&s;cripts, and collects Copies, I apply'd to him for &s;ome Editions of this Poem, which he readily oblig'd me with. But, ad|ded he, taking down a paper, I doubt I &s;hall di&s;cou|rage you from your tran&s;lation, when I &s;how this work, which is written upon the original, by ZOILUS, the famous adver&s;ary of HOMER. ZOILUS! &s;aid I with
<PB N="178" REF="179">&s;urprize; I thought his works had long &s;ince peri&s;h'd. They have &s;o, an&s;wer'd he, all, except this little Piece, which has a PREFACE annex'd to it accounting for its pre&s;ervation. It &s;eems, when he parted from Macedon, he left this behind him where he lodg'd, and where no one enter'd for a long time, in dete&s;tation of the odi|ou&s;ne&s;s of his character, 'till Maevius arriving there in his travels, and being de&s;irous to lie in the &s;ame room, luckily found it, and brought it away with him. This the author of the PREFACE imagines the rea&s;on of Ho|race's wi&s;hing Maevius, in the 10th EPODE, &s;uch a &s;hipwreck as HOMER de&s;cribes; as it were with an eye to his having done &s;omething di&s;advantageous to that Poet. From Maevius, the piece came into the hand of Carbilius Pictor, (who, when he wrote again&s;t Virgil, call'd his book, with a re&s;pectful imitation of ZOILUS, the AENEIDOMASTIX) and from him into the hands of others who are unknown, becau&s;e the world apply'd to them no other name than that of ZOILUS, in order to &s;ink their own in oblivion. Thus it ever found &s;ome learned philologi&s;t or critic, to keep it &s;ecret from the rage of HOMER's admirers; yet not &s;o &s;ecret, but that it has &s;till been communicated among the LITERATI. I am of opinion, that our great SCALIGER borrow'd it, to work him up when he writ &s;o &s;harply again&s;t Cardan; and perhaps Le Clerc too, when he prov'd Q.

<HEAD>THE REMARKS OF ZOILUS UPON HOMER'S BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND MICE.</HEAD>
<P>Pag. 43. Ver, 1.</P>
<P>TO FILL MY RISING SONG.] <Q>As Protagoras the &s;ophi&s;t found fault with the beginning of the ILIAD, for its &s;peaking to the Mu&s;e rather with an abrupt command, than a &s;olemn invocation; &s;o I, &s;ays ZOILUs, doon the other hand find fault with him for u&s;ing any invocation at all before this poem, or any &s;uch trifles as he is the author of If he mu&s;t u&s;e one, Protagoras is in the right; if not, I am: this I hold for true critici&s;m, notwith&s;tanding the opinion of Ari&s;totle again&s;t us. Nor let any one lay
<PB N="181" REF="182">a &s;tre&s;s on Ari&s;totle in this point; he alas ! knows nothing of Poetry but what he has read in HOMER; his rules are all extracted from him, or founded in him. In &s;hort, HOMER'S works are the examples of Ari&s;totle's precepts; and Ari&s;totle's precepts the methods HOMER wrought by.</Q> From hence it is to be concluded as the opinion of this Critic, that who|ever wou'd entirely de&s;troy the reputation of HOMER, mu&s;t renounce the authority of Ari&s;totle before-hand. The rules of building may be of &s;ervice to us, if we de&s;ign to judge of an edifice, and di&s;cover what may be ami&s;s in it for the advantage of future artificers; but they are of no u&s;e to tho&s;e who only intend to o|verthrow it utterly.</P>
<P>After the word [SONG,] in the fir&s;t line the ori|ginal adds, [WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IN MY TA|BLETS.] The&s;e words, which are dropp'd in the tran&s;|lation as of no con&s;equence, the great ZOILUS has thought fit to expunge; a&s;&s;erting for a rea&s;on, with|out backing it with farther proof, <Q>That tablets were it not of fo early invention.</Q> Now, it mu&s;t be grant|ed, this manner of proving by affirmation is of an ex|traordinary nature; but however it has its end with a &s;et of readers for whom it is adapted. One part of the world knows not with what a&s;&s;urance another part can expre&s;s it&s;elf. They imagine a rea&s;onable creature will not have the face to &s;ay any thing which has not &s;ome &s;hadow of rea&s;on to &s;upport it; and run impli|citly
<PB N="182" REF="183">into the &s;nare which is laid for good-nature, by the&s;e daring authors of definitive &s;entences upon bare a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Pag. 43. Ver. 15. WHOM CATS PURSU'D.] The Greek word here expre&s;ly &s;ignifies a Cat: ZOILUS, whom Perizonius follows, affirms, <Q>It was Weezels which the Mou&s;e fled from;</Q> and then objects a|gain&s;t its probability. But it is common with one &s;ort of Critics, to &s;hew an author means differently from what he really did; and then to prove, that the mean|ing which they find out for him is good for nothing.</P>
<P>Pag. 44. Ver. 7. IF WORTHY FRIENDSHIP.] In this propo&s;al begins the moral of the whole piece, which is, that ha&s;ty, ill-founded, or unnatural friend|&s;hips and leagues, will naturally end in war and di&s;|cord. But ZOILUS, who is here mightily concern'd to take off from HOMER all the honour of having de&s;ign'd a moral, a&s;&s;erts on the other hand, <Q>That the Poet's whole intent was to make a Fable; that a Fable he has made, and one very idle and trifling; that many things are a&s;crib'd to HOMER, which poor HOMER never dream'd of; and he who finds them out, ra|ther &s;hews his own parts than di&s;covers his author's beauties.</Q> In this opinion has he been follow'd by &s;everal of tho&s;e Critics, who only dip into authors when they have occa&s;ion to write again&s;t them: and yet even the&s;e &s;hall &s;peak differently concerning the writers, if the que&s;tion be of their own performances;
<PB N="183" REF="184">for to their own works they write Prefaces, to di&s;|play the grandne&s;s of the moral, regularity of the &s;cheme, number and brightne&s;s of the figures, and a thou&s;and other excellencies, which if they did not tell, no one wou'd ever imagine. For others, they write Remarks, which tend to contract their excellencies within the narrow compa&s;s of their partial appre|he&s;ion. It were well if they cou'd allow &s;uch to be as wi&s;e as them&s;elves, whom the world allows to be much wi&s;er; but their being naturally friends to them&s;elves, and profe&s;&s;edly adver&s;aries to &s;ome greater genius, ea&s;ily accounts for the&s;e different man|ners of &s;peaking. I will not leave this note, without giving you an in&s;tance of its practice in the great JU|LIUS SCALIGER: he has been free enough with HO|MER in the Remarks he makes upon him; but when he &s;peaks of him&s;elf, I de&s;ire my reader wou'd take no|tice of his mode&s;ty; I give his own words, Lib. 3. Poet. Cap. 112. <Q>In Deum Patrem Hymnum cum &s;criberemus, tanquam rerum omnium conditorem, ab orbis ip&s;ius creatione ad nos no&s;traque u&s;que duxi|mus. &mdash;In quo abduximus animum no&s;trum a cor|poris carcere ad liberos campos contemplationis, quae me in illum transformaret.

<P>Pag. 46. Ver. 1. BUT ME, NOR STALKS.] In this place ZOILUS <Q>laughs at the ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of the Poet, who (according to his repre&s;entation) makes a prince refu&s;e an invitation in heroics, becau&s;e he did not like the meat he was invited to.</Q> And, that the ridicule may appear in as &s;trong a light to others
<PB N="185" REF="186">as to him&s;elf, he puts as much of the &s;peech as con|cerns it into burle&s;que airs, and expre&s;&s;ions. This is indeed a common trick with Remarkers, which they either practi&s;e by precedent from their ma&s;ter ZOILUS, or are beholden for it to the &s;ame turn of temper.

O great POLYCRATES, how happily ha&s;t thou ob|&s;erv?d in thy accu&s;ation again&s;t SOCRATES, That whatever he was before, he de&s;erv'd his poi&s;on when he began to make ver&s;es!</Q> Now, if the que&s;tion be concerning HOMER'S good or bad Poetry, this is an unqualifying &s;peech, which affords his friends ju&s;t grounds of exception again&s;t the Critic.

It is ei|ther this notion, or a care which the Gods may take to abate the pride of in&s;ulting adver&s;aries, which a
<PB N="187" REF="188">Poet goes upon, when he makes his leaders die fore|telling the end of tho&s;e by whom they are &s;lain. ZOI|LUS however is again&s;t this pa&s;&s;age. He &s;ays, <Q>That every character ought to be &s;trictly kept; that a ge|neral ought not to invade the character of a prophet, nor a prophet of a general.</Q> He is po&s;itive, <Q>that nothing &s;hou'd be done by any one, without having been hinted at in &s;ome previous account of him.</Q> And this he a&s;&s;erts, without any allowance made either for a change of &s;tates, or the de&s;ign of the Gods. To confirm this ob&s;ervation, he &s;trengthens it with a quo|tation out of his larger work on the ILIAD, where he has the&s;e words upon the death of HECTOR: <Q>How fooli&s;h is it in HOMER to make HECTOR (who thro' the whole cour&s;e of the ILIAD had made u&s;e of HE|LENUS, to learn the will of the Gods) becomes pro|phet ju&s;t at his death? Let every one be what he ought, without falling into tho&s;e parts which others are to &s;u&s;tain in a poem.</Q> This he has &s;aid, not di|&s;tingui&s;hing rightly between our natural di&s;po&s;tions and accidental offices. And this he has &s;aid again, not minding, that tho' it be taken from another book, it is &s;till from the &s;ame author. However, vanity loves to gratify it&s;elf by the repetition of what it e&s;teems, to be written with &s;pirit, and even when we repeat it our|&s;elves, provided another hears us. Hence has he been follow'd by a magi&s;terial &s;et of men who quote them|&s;elves, and &s;well their new perfomances with what
<PB N="188" REF="189">they admire in their former Treati&s;es. This is a mo&s;t extraordinary knack of arguing, whereby a man can never want a proof, if he be allow'd to become an au|thority for his own opinion.</P>
<P>Pag. 48. Ver. 16. AND NO KIND BILLOW.] <Q>How impertinent is this ca&s;e of pity, &s;ays ZOILUS, to be|moan, that the prince was not to&s;s'd towards land: It is enough he lo&s;t his life, and there is an end of his &s;uffering where there is an end of his feeling. To carry the matter farther, is ju&s;t the &s;ame fooli&s;h management as HOMER has &s;hewn in his ILIADS, which he &s;pins out into forty trifles beyond the death of HECTOR.</Q> But the Critic mu&s;t allow me to put the renders in mind, that death was not the la&s;t di&s;tre&s;s the Ancients believ'd was to be met upon earth. The la&s;t was the remaining unbury'd, which had this mi&s;ery an|nex'd, that while the body was without its funeral-rites in this world, the &s;oul was &s;uppos'd to be without re&s;t in the next. which was the ca&s;e of the Mou&s;e be|fore us. And accordingly the AJAX of SOPHOCLES continues after the death of its hero more than an act, upon the conte&s;t concerning his burial. All this ZOI|LUS knew very well: but ZOILUS is not the only one, who di&s;putes for victory rather than truth. The&s;e fooli&s;h, to &s;hew how much they can write again&s;t an author. They act unfairly, that they may be &s;ure to be &s;harp enough; and trifle with the reader, in order
<PB N="189" REF="190">to be voluminous. It is needle&s;s to wi&s;h them the re|turn they de&s;erve: their di&s;regard to candour is no &s;ooner di&s;cover'd, but they are for ever bani&s;h'd from the eyes of men of &s;en&s;e, and condemn'd to wander from &s;tall to &s;tall, for a temporary refuge from that oblivion which they can't e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Pag. 49. Ver. 1. OUR ELDEST PERISH'D.] ZOI|LUS had here taken <Q>the recapitulation of tho&s;e mi&s;|fortunes which happen'd to the Royal Family, as an impertinence that expatiates from the &s;ubject;</Q> tho' indeed there &s;eems nothing more proper to rai&s;e that &s;ort of compa&s;&s;ion, which was to in&s;lame his audience to war. But what appears extremely plea&s;ant is, that at the &s;ame time he condemns the pa&s;&s;age, he &s;hou'd make u&s;e of it as an opportunity, to fall into <Q>an ample digre&s;&s;ion on the various kinds of Mou&s;e|traps,</Q> and di&s;play that minute learning which e|very Critic of his &s;ort is fond to &s;hew him&s;elf ma&s;ter of. This they imagine is tracing of knowledge thro' its hidden veins, and bringing di&s;coveries to day|light, which time had cover'd over. Indefatigable and u&s;ele&s;s mortals! who value them&s;elves for knowledge of no con&s;equence, and think of gaining applau&s;e by what the reader is careful to pa&s;s over unread. What did the di&s;qui&s;ition &s;ignify formerly, whether Uly&s;&s;es's Son, or his Dog, was the elder? or how can the ac|count of a Ve&s;ture, or a Player's Ma&s;que, de&s;erve that any &s;hou'd write the bulk of a treati&s;e, or others read

<P>Pag. 49. Ver. 15, 16. QUILLS APTLY BOUND&mdash;FAC'D WITH THE PLUNDER OF A CAT THEY FLAY'D.] This pa&s;&s;age is &s;omething difficult in the original, which gave ZOILUS the opportunity of inventing an expre&s;&s;ion, which his followers conceitedly u&s;e when any thing appears dark to them. <Q>This, &s;ay they, let Phoebus explain;</Q> as if what exceeds their capa|city mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity demand oracular interpretations, and an interpo&s;al of the God of Wit and Learning. The ba&s;is of &s;uch arrogance is the opinion they have of that knowledge they a&s;cribe to them&s;elves. They take Critici&s;m to be beyond every other part of learn|ing, becau&s;e it gives judgment upon books written in every other part. They think in con&s;equence, that every Critic mu&s;t be a greater Genius than any Au|thor whom he cen&s;ures; and therefore if they e&s;teem them&s;elves Critics, they &s;et enthron'd Infancy at the head of Literature. Critici&s;m indeed de&s;erves a noble Elogy, when it is enlarg'd by &s;uch a comprehen&s;ive learning as Ari&s;totle and Cicero were ma&s;ters of; when it adorns its precepts with the con&s;ummate exactne&s;s of Quintilian, or is exalted into the &s;ublime &s;entiments of Longinus. But let not &s;uch men tell us they parti|cipate in the glory of the&s;e great men, and place them|&s;elves
<PB N="191" REF="192">next to PHOEBUS, who, like ZOILUS, entangle an author in the wrangles of grammarians, or try him with a po&s;itive air and barren imagination, by the &s;et of rules they have collected out of others.</P>
<P>Pag. 50. Ver. 1. YE FROGS! THE MICE.] At this &s;peech of the Herald's, which recites the cau&s;e of the war, ZOILUS is angry with the Author, <Q>for not finding out a cau&s;e entirely ju&s;t; for, &s;ays he, it appears not from his own Fable, that Phy&s;ignathus invited the prince with any malicious intention to make him away.</Q> To this we an&s;wer, 1&s;t, That it is not nece&s;&s;ary in relating facts to make every war have a ju&s;t beginning. 2dly, This doubtful cau&s;e a|grees better with the moral, by &s;hewing that ill-found|ed leagues have accidents to de&s;troy them, even with|out the intention of parties. 3dly, There was all ap|pearance imaginable again&s;t the frogs; and if we may be allow'd to retort on our adver&s;ary the practice of his po&s;terity, there is more humanity in an ho&s;tility pro|claim'd upon the appearance of inju&s;tice done us, than in their cu&s;tom of attacking the works of others as &s;oon as they come out, purely becau&s;e they are e&s;teem'd to be good. Their performances, which cou'd derive no merit from their own names, are then &s;old upon the merit of their antagoni&s;t: and if they are &s;o &s;en|&s;ible of fame, or even of envy, they have the morti|fication to remember, how much by this means they be|come indebted to tho&s;e they injure.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="193">Pag. 50. Ver. 21. WHERE HIGH THE BANKS.] This project is not put in practice during the follow|ing battle, by rea&s;on of the fury of the combatants: yet the mention of it is not impertinent in this place, fora&s;much as the probable face of &s;ucce&s;s which it car|ties with it tended to animate the Frogs. ZOILUS however cannot be &s;o &s;atisfied; <Q>It were better, &s;ays he, to cut it intirely out; nor won'd HOMER be the wor&s;e if half of him were &s;erv'd in the &s;ame man|ner; &s;o, continues he, they will find it, whoever in any country, &s;hall hereafter undertake &s;o odd a ta&s;k, as that of tran&s;lating him.</Q> Thus Envy finds words to put in the mouth of Ignorance; and the time will come, when Ignorance &s;hall repeat what Envy has pronounced &s;o ra&s;hly.</P>
<P>Pag. 51. Ver. 13. AND TAP'RING SEA-REEDS.] If we here take the reed for that of our own growth, it is no &s;pear to match the long &s;ort of needles with which the Mice had arm'd them&s;elves; but the cane, which is rather intended, has its &s;plinters &s;tiff and &s;harp, to an&s;wer all the u&s;es of a &s;pear in battle. Nor is it here to be lightly pa&s;t over, &s;ince ZOILUS moves a que&s;tion upon it, that the Poet cou'd not choo&s;e a more proper weapon for the Frogs, than that which they choo&s;e for them&s;elves in a defen&s;ive war they maintain with the &s;erpents of Nile. <Q>They have this &s;tratagem, &s;ays Aelian, to protect them&s;elves; they &s;wim with pieces of cane acro&s;s their mouths, of too great a length
<PB N="193" REF="194">for the breadth of the &s;erpents throats; by which means they are pre&s;erv'd from being &s;wallow'd by them.</Q> This is a quotation &s;o much to the point, that I ought to have u&s;her'd in my Author with more pomp to dazzle the reader. ZOILUS and his follow|ers, who &s;eldom prai&s;e any man, are however careful to do it for their own &s;akes, if at any time they get an author of their opinion: tho' indeed it mu&s;t be al|low'd, they &s;till have a draw-back in their manner of prai&s;e, and rather choo&s;e to drop the name of their man, or darkly hint him in a periphra&s;is, than to have it ap|pear that they have directly a&s;&s;i&s;ted the perpetuating of any one's memory. Thus, if a Dutch Critic were to introduce for example MARTIAL, he would, in&s;tead of naming him, &s;ay, INGENIOSUS ILLE EPIGRAMMATI|CUS BILBILICUS. Or, if one of our own were to quote from among our&s;elves, he wou'd tell us how it has been remark'd <Q>in the works of a learned Writer, to whom the world is obliged for many excellent productions,</Q> etc. All which proceeding is like boa&s;ting of our great friends, when it is to do our&s;elves an honour, or the &s;hift of dre&s;&s;ing up one who might otherwi&s;e be di&s;regarded, to make him pa&s;s upon the world for a re&s;pon&s;ible voucher to our own a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>Pag. 51. Ver. 17. BUT NOW WHERE JOVE'S.] At this fine Epi&s;ode, in which the Gods are introduced, ZOILUS has no patience left him to remark; but runs &s;ome lines with a long &s;tring of &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, as
<PB N="194" REF="195">"Trifler, Fabler, Lyar, fooli&s;h, impious," all which he lavi&s;hly heaps upon the Poet. From this knack of calling names, join'd with the &s;everal arts of finding fault, it is to be &s;u&s;pected, that our ZOILUS'S might make very able libellers, and dangerous men to the government, if they did not rather turn them&s;elves to be ridiculous cen&s;ors: for which rea&s;on I cannot but reckon the &s;tate oblig'd to men of wit; and under a kind of debt in gratitude, when they take off &s;o much &s;pleen, turbulency, and ill-nature, as might otherwi&s;e &s;pend it&s;elf to the detriment of the public.</P>
<P>Pag. 52. Ver. 5. IF MY DAUGHTER'S MIND.] This &s;peech, which Jupiter &s;peaks to Pallas with a plea&s;ant kind of air, ZOILUS takes gravely to pieces; and affirms, <Q>It is below Jupiter's wi&s;dom, and on|ly agreeable with HOMER'S folly, that he &s;hou'd bor|row a rea&s;on for her a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Mice from their at|tendance in the temple, when they waited to prey upon tho&s;e things which were &s;acred to her.</Q> But the air of the &s;peech rendering a grave an&s;wer unne|ce&s;&s;ary; I &s;hall only offer ZOILUS an ob&s;ervation in return for his.

Now if &s;uch can be compar'd to Mice, let the words of ZOILUS be brought home to him&s;elf and his fol|lowers
<PB N="195" REF="196">for their mortification. <Q>That no one ought to think of meriting in the &s;tate of learning only by de|ba&s;ing the be&s;t performances, and as it were prey|ing upon tho&s;e things which &s;hou'd be &s;acred in it.</Q></P>
<P>Pag. 52. Ver. 13. IN VAIN MY FATHER.] The &s;peech of Pallas is di&s;lik'd by ZOILUS, <Q>becau&s;e it makes the Godde&s;s carry a re&s;entment again&s;t &s;uch incon&s;iderable creatures;</Q> tho' he ought to e&s;teem them otherwi&s;e when they repre&s;ent the per&s;ons and actions of men, and teach us how the Gods, di&s;regard tho&s;e in their adver&s;ities who provoke them in pro&s;pe|rity. But, if we con&s;ider Pallas as the patrone&s;s of learn|ing, we may by an allegorical application of the Mice and Frogs, find in this &s;peech two &s;orts of enemies to learning; they who are maliciou&s;ly mi&s;chievous, as the Mice; and they who are turbulent through o&s;tentation, as the Frogs. The fir&s;t are enemies to excellency up|on principle; the &s;econd accidentally by the error of &s;elf-love, which does not quarrel with the excellence it&s;elf, but only with tho&s;e people who get more prai&s;e than them&s;elves by it. Thus, tho' they have not the &s;ame perver&s;ene&s;s with the others, they are however drawn into the &s;ame practices, while they ruin reputa|tions, le&s;t they &s;hou'd not &s;eem to be learn'd; as &s;ome women turn pro&s;titutes, le&s;t they &s;hou'd not be thought hand&s;ome enough to have admirers.</P>
<P>Pag. 54. Ver. 5. THEIR DREADFUL TRUMPETS.] Upon the reading of this, ZOILUS becomes full of di&s;|coveries.
<PB N="196" REF="197">He recollects, <Q>that Homer makes his Greeks come to battle with &s;ilence, and his Trojans with &s;houts;</Q> from whence he di&s;covers, <Q>that he knew nothing of trumpets.</Q> Again, he &s;ees, <Q>that the hornet is made a trumpeter to the battle;</Q> and hence he di&s;covers, <Q>that the line mu&s;t not be HO|MER'S.</Q> Now had he drawn his con&s;equences fair|ly, he cou'd only have found by the one, that trum|pets were not in u&s;e at the taking of Troy; and by the other, that the battle of Frogs and Mice was laid by the Poet for a later &s;cene of action than that of the ILIAD. But the boa&s;t of di&s;coveries accompanies the affectation of knowledge; and the affectation of know|ledge is taken up with a de&s;ign to gain a command o|ver the opinions of others. It is too heavy a ta&s;k for &s;ome Critics to &s;way our rational judgments by ratio|nal inferences; a pompous pretence mu&s;t occa&s;ion ad|miration, the eyes of mankind mu&s;t be ob&s;cur'd by a glare of pedantry, that they may con&s;ent to be led blind|fold, and permit that an opinion &s;hou'd be dictated to them without demanding that they may be rea&s;on'd into it.</P>
<P>Pag. 54. Ver. 24. BIG SEUTLAEUS TUMBLING.] ZOILUS has happen'd to bru&s;h the du&s;t of &s;ome old manu&s;cript, in which the line that kills SEUTLAEUS is wanting. And for this cau&s;e he fixes a general conclu|&s;ion, <Q>that there is no dependance upon any thing which is handed down for HOMER'S, &s;o as to allow it
<PB N="197" REF="198">prai&s;e; &s;ince the different copies vary among&s;t them|&s;elves.</Q> But is it fair in ZOILUS, or any of his fol|lowers, to oppo&s;e one copy to a thou&s;and? and are they impartial who wou'd pa&s;s this upon us for an ho|ne&s;t balance of evidence? When there is &s;uch an in|equality on each &s;ide, is it not more than probable that the number carry the author's &s;en&s;e in them, and the &s;ingle one its tran&s;criber's errors? It is folly or mad|ne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion to be thus given over to partiality and prejudices. Men may flouri&s;h as much as they plea&s;e concerning the value of a new-found edition, in or|der to bya&s;s the world to particular parts of it; but in a matter ea&s;ily decided by common &s;en&s;e, it will &s;till continue of its own opinion.</P>
<P>Pag. 56. Ver. 17. WITH BORBOCAETES FIGHTS] Through the grammatical part of ZOILUS'S work he frequently rails at HOMER for his dialects. "The&s;e," &s;ays he in one place, <Q>the Poet made u&s;e of becau&s;e he could not write pure Greek;</Q> and in another, <Q>they &s;trangely contributed to his fame, by making &s;e|veral cities who ob&s;erv'd &s;omething of their own in his mix'd language, contend for his being one of their natives.</Q> Now &s;ince I have here practis'd a licence in imitation of his, by &s;hortning the word BORBO|CAETES a whole &s;yllable, it &s;eems a good opportunity to &s;peak for him where I defend my&s;elf. Remember then, that any great genius, who introduces Poetry into a language, has a power to poli&s;h it, and of all the
<PB N="198" REF="199">manners of &s;peaking then in u&s;e, to &s;ettle that for Poe|tical which he judges mo&s;t adapted to the art. Take notice too, that HOMER has not only done this for ne|ce&s;&s;ity, but for ornament, &s;ince he u&s;es various dialects to humour his &s;en&s;e with &s;ounds which are expre&s;&s;ive of it. Thus much in behalf of my Author to an&s;wer ZOILUS: as for my&s;elf, who deal with his followers, I mu&s;t argue from nece&s;&s;ity, that the word was &s;tub|born and wou'd not ply to the quantities of an Engli&s;h Ver&s;e, and therefore I alter'd it by the Dialect we call Poetical, which makes my line &s;o much &s;moother, that I am ready to cry with their brother LIPSIUS, when he turn'd an O into an I, <Q>Vel ego me amo, vel me amavit Phoebus quando hoc correxi.</Q> To this let me add a recrimination upon &s;ome of them: As 1&s;t, &s;uch as choo&s;e words written after the manner of tho&s;e who preceded the pure&s;t age of a language, without the nece&s;&s;ity I have pleaded, as <Q>regundi for regendi, per|duit for perdidit,</Q> which re&s;toration of ob&s;olete words de&s;erves to be call'd a Critical Licence or Dia|lect. 2dly, Tho&s;e who pretending to ver&s;e without an ear, u&s;e the Poetical Dialect of Abbreviation, &s;o that the lines &s;hall run the rougher for it. And 3dly, tho&s;e who pre&s;ume by their Critical Licences to alter the &s;pellings of words; an affectation which de&s;troys the etymology of a language, and being carry'd on by pri|vate hands for fancy or fa&s;hion, wou'd be a thing we &s;hou'd never have an end.</P>

<P>Pag. 61. Ver. 11.

In &s;hort, an author who writes for every age, may even erect him&s;elf a monument of tho&s;e &s;tones which Envy throws at him: while the Critic who writes again&s;t him can have no fame becau&s;e he had no &s;ucce&s;s; or if he fancies he may &s;ucceed, he &s;hou'd remember, that by the nature of his undertaking he wou'd but undermine his own foundation; for he is to &s;ink of cour&s;e, when the book which he writes again&s;t, and for which alone he is read, is lo&s;t in di&s;repute or oblivion.</P>

<L>And now the &s;un and now the &s;tars are gone;</L>
<L>Yet &s;till methinks the &s;pirit bears me on,</L>
<L>Where tracts of aether purer blue di&s;play,</L>
<L>And edge the golden realm of native day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O &s;trange enjoyment of a bli&s;s un&s;een!</L>
<L>O ravi&s;hment! O &s;acred rage within!</L>
<L>Tumultuous plea&s;ure, rais'd on peace of mind,</L>
<L>Sincere, exce&s;&s;ive, from the world refin'd!</L>
<L>I &s;ee the light that veils the throne on high,</L>
<L>A light unpierc'd by man's impurer eye;</L>
<L>I hear the words that i&s;&s;uing thence proclaim,</L>
<L>"Let God's attendants prai&s;e his awful name;"</L>
<L><PB N="231" REF="231">Then heads unnumber'd bend before the &s;hrine,</L>
<L>My&s;terious &s;eat of Maje&s;ty Divine!</L>
<L>And hands unnumber'd &s;trike the &s;ilver &s;tring,</L>
<L>And tongues unnumber'd Hallelujah &s;ing.</L>
<L>See, where the &s;hining &s;eraphim appear,</L>
<L>And &s;ink their decent eyes with holy fear;</L>
<L>See flights of angels all their feathers rai&s;e,</L>
<L>And range the orbs, and as they range they prai&s;e;</L>
<L>Behold the great Apo&s;tles joyful met,</L>
<L>And high on pearls of azure aether &s;et;</L>
<L>Behold the Prophets full of heav'nly fire</L>
<L>With wand'ring fingers wake the trembling lyre;</L>
<L>And hear the Martyrs tune; and all around</L>
<L>The church triumphant makes the region &s;ound;</L>
<L>With harps of gold, with boughs of ever-green,</L>
<L>With robes of white, the pious throngs are &s;een;</L>
<L>Exalted anthems all their hours employ,</L>
<L>And all is mu&s;ic, and exce&s;s of joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Charm'd with the &s;ight I long to bear a part,</L>
<L>The plea&s;ure flutters at my ravi&s;h'd heart.</L>
<L>Sweet &s;aints and angels of the heav'nly quire!</L>
<L>If Love has warm'd me with cele&s;tial fire,</L>
<L>A&s;&s;i&s;t my words, and as they move along,</L>
<L>With Hallelujah crown the burthen'd &s;ong.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Father of all above and all below!</L>
<L>O great beyond expre&s;&s;ion!&mdash;</L>
<L>No bounds thy knowledge, none thy pow'r confine,</L>
<L>For pow'r and knowledge in their &s;ource are thine:</L>
<L><PB N="232" REF="232">Around thee glory &s;preads her golden wing.</L>
<L>Sing, glitt'ring angels, Hallelujah &s;ing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Son of the Father! fir&s;t begotten Son,</L>
<L>Ere the &s;hort meas'ring line of time begun!</L>
<L>The world has &s;een thy works, and joy'd to &s;ee</L>
<L>His bright effulgence manife&s;t in thee.</L>
<L>The world mu&s;t own thee Love's unfathom'd &s;pring.</L>
<L>Sing, glitt'ring angels, Hallelujah &s;ing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Proceeding Spirit! equally divine,</L>
<L>In whom the Godhead's full perfections &s;hine;</L>
<L>With various graces, comforts unexpre&s;t,</L>
<L>With holy tran&s;ports you refine the brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And earth is heav'nly where your gifts you bring.</L>
<L>Sing, glitt'ring angels, Hallelujah &s;ing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But where's my rapture? where my wond'rous heat?</L>
<L>What interruption makes my bli&s;s retreat?</L>
<L>This world's got in, the thought of t'other's cro&s;t,</L>
<L>And the gay picture's in my fancy lo&s;t.</L>
<L>With what an eager zeal the con&s;cious &s;oul</L>
<L>Would claim its &s;eat, and &s;oaring pa&s;s the pole?</L>
<L>But our attempts the&s;e chains of earth re&s;train,</L>
<L>Deride our toil, and drag us down again.</L>
<L>So from the ground a&s;piring meteors go,</L>
<L>And rank'd with planets, light the would below;</L>
<L>But their own bodies &s;ink them in the &s;ky,</L>
<L>When the warmth's gone that taught them how to fly.</L>
