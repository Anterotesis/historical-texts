<P>THE baths in Per&s;ia are very commodious, and well worth the attention of a &s;tranger. They con&s;i&s;t gene|rally of two large apartments, one of which furni&s;hes a place for undre&s;&s;ing, the other is the bath. On the &s;ide of the fir&s;t are &s;tone benches, rai&s;ed two feet from the ground, covered with mats and carpets, where the bathers &s;it to undre&s;s, and thence they proceed to the bath, through a long, narrow pa&s;&s;age. The bath is a large room, of an octagon form, with a cupola at top, through which the light and air are admitted. On the &s;ides of this room
<PB N="4" REF="5">
are &s;mall platforms of wood, rai&s;ed about a foot from the ground, on which the people, who enter to bathe, per|form their devotions, a ceremony the Per&s;ians always previou&s;ly ob&s;erve. At the upper-end of the room is a large ba&s;on, or re&s;ervoir of water, built of &s;tone, well-heated by means of &s;toves, made at the bottom, with iron gratings over them; and adjoining is another of cold water, of either of which the bather has his choice. In the morning, before day, a &s;ervant goes to the terrace, on the top of the hou&s;e, and &s;ounds a &s;hell, or horn, to give notice that the bath is ready. When any per&s;on comes to bathe, he undre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the front room, as was &s;aid, ties a cloth about his middle, which reaches down to his knees, and proceeds to the &s;tove. When he comes out of the hot bath, which is generally in the &s;pace of ten or twelve minutes, the people of the hou&s;e &s;tand ready to perform the operation of rubbing, and, to effect this, he is laid on his back, at full length, with a pillow to &s;upport his head; a bru&s;h made of camel's hair is then u&s;ed, which completely cleans the body. After &s;ome time rubbing, they rin&s;e the whole body with &s;everal ba&s;ons of warm water, and the per|&s;on is reconducted to the dre&s;&s;ing-room, where he &s;hifts, and dre&s;&s;es at lei&s;ure, receiving a calean to &s;moke.</P>
<P><HI>Chardin</HI> &s;ays, that the &s;ervants of the bath rub the bather from head to foot, in &s;o rough a manner, that tho&s;e, who are not u&s;ed to it, think he is about to flea them. Afterwards he &s;haves the per&s;on's head and face,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
if he de&s;ires it, cuts his finger and toe-nails, handles his body, &s;queezes and rubs it, and &s;tretches every finger and limb, as if he was about to di&s;locate them, and this takes up a quarter of an hour. After the per&s;on has been thus &s;tretched and &s;queezed, he plunges into the bath again, and, being wiped dry, returns to the dre&s;&s;ing-room, and puts on his cloaths. The time for the men's bathing is from day-break to four in the afternoon, and that for the women, from four till midnight. When it is the women's turn to bathe, the male &s;ervants of the bagnio withdraw, and are &s;ucceeded by girls. The ladies are never &s;o finely dre&s;&s;ed as when they come to bathe. This is the only opportunity they have of vying with each other in the article of cloaths; and their per|fumes and e&s;&s;ences are enough to &s;tifle one who is not u&s;ed to them.</P>
<P>Great men have bagnios in their own hou&s;es; and tho&s;e of a lower rank have them adjoining to their hou&s;es, re&s;erve them to them&s;elves at certain times, but let them out to others, on condition only of keeping a con&s;tant fire, with ve&s;&s;els and other implements ne|ce&s;&s;ary for bathing.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians are much more &s;crupulous than any other ea&s;tern nation, in permitting foreigners to go into their baths, which, if attempted without their knowledge, they prevent, alledging, in excu&s;e, that if it was known that they admitted a <HI>Ferengy</HI> (this is the word they expre&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="7">
chri&s;tians by) they &s;hould lo&s;e both their cu&s;tom and reputation, as the bath would be thereby deemed polluted.</P>
<P>During the &s;pring, the baths are dre&s;&s;ed out in great finery, a cu&s;tom di&s;tingui&s;hed by the natives under the name of <HI>Gul Re&agrave;zee,</HI> or the &s;cattering of ro&s;es, from the va&s;t quantity of tho&s;e flowers &s;trewed in the apartments. This ceremony continues a week, or ten days, during which time, the gue&s;ts are entertained with mu&s;ic, dancing, coffee, &s;herbet, &amp;c. and the dre&s;&s;ing-room is decked out with paintings, looking-gla&s;&s;es, &s;treamers, and other ornaments, at the expence of the ma&s;ter of the <HI>huma&ugrave;m,</HI> or hummum, as we call it, who compliments his cu&s;tomers on the occa&s;ion, though a &s;mall pre&s;ent is made by them to the mu&s;icians. In Shirauz the baths are u&s;ed alternately by men and women, every other day.</P>
<P>In the centre of the city of Shirauz is a large building, called by the Per&s;ians <HI>Sh&agrave;h Chera&ugrave;g,</HI> or the King's lamp, and is con&s;idered as a place of the greate&s;t &s;anctity, being the mau&s;oleum of the mother of one of their Imaums, or heads of the faith: it is a place of high antiquity, but the exact date of its foundation cannot be a&s;certained. The tomb of the celebrated and de&s;ervedly admired Hafiz, one of the mo&s;t famous of the Per&s;ian poets, &s;tands about two miles from Shirauz. Here govern|ment has erected a mo&s;t elegant aivan, or hall, with apartments adjoining. No co&s;t has been &s;pared to ren|der
<PB N="7" REF="8">
it agreeable. It &s;tands in the middle of a large gar|den. In the front of the apartments is a &s;tone re&s;ervoir, with a fountain in the centre. In the garden are many cypre&s;s trees, of extraordinary &s;ize and beauty, as well as of great antiquity. Under the &s;hade of the&s;e trees is the tomb of Hafiz, of fine white marble, from Tauris, eight feet long, and broad, covering the original tomb. On the top and &s;ides are &s;elect pieces from the poet's own works, mo&s;t beautifully cut in the Per&s;ian Nu&s;taleek character. During the &s;pring and &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, the inhabitants vi&s;it this &s;pot, and amu&s;e them&s;elves with &s;moaking, playing at che&s;s, and other games, reading al&s;o the works of Hafiz, whom they e&s;teem more than any of their poets, and whom they venerate almo&s;t to adoration, never &s;peaking of him, but in the highe&s;t terms of rapture and enthu&s;ia&s;m. A mo&s;t elegant copy of his works is kept upon the tomb, for the purpo&s;e and in&s;pection of all who go there. The principal youth of the city a&s;&s;emble here, and &s;hew every po&s;&s;ible mark of re&s;pect for their favourite poet, making plentiful libations of the delicious wine of Shirauz to his memory.</P>
<P>Sadi's tomb, another of their famous poets, who flouri&s;hed about five hundred and fifty years ago, is al&s;o in being, though out of repair. It is &s;ituated at the foot of the mountains that border the plain, or valley, of Shirauz. It is a large &s;quare building, at the upper-end of which are two alcoves, or rece&s;&s;es in the wall.
<PB N="8" REF="9">
That on the right is the tomb of Sadi, ju&s;t in the &s;tate it was in, when he was buried, built of &s;tone, &s;ix feet long, and two and a half broad. On the &s;ides are en|graved many &s;entences in the old Nu&s;khi character, relating to the poet and his works. On the tomb is placed, for the in&s;pection of all who vi&s;it it, a manu&s;cript copy of his works, mo&s;t elegantly tran&s;cribed. And this place the people of Shirauz vi&s;it occa&s;ionally, as they do the tomb of Hafiz.</P>
<P>Not far from Hafiz's tomb, is a magnificent building, called <HI>Heft Tun,</HI> or &s;even bodies, erected in commemo|ration of &s;even dervi&s;es, who came from a great di&s;tance, to re&s;ide in this country, and took up their abode on this &s;pot, and there continued till they all died, each burying the other &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, until the only &s;urvivor was buried there by the neighbours. This hall is lined one third of the height with white Tauris marble, and the cieling ornamented with blue and gold enamel. It has &s;ome tolerable paintings executed in the Per&s;ian &s;tyle, among&s;t which, is one of Abraham's offering up his &s;on I&s;aac, and another of Mo&s;es, when a boy, tending the flocks of his father-in-law, Jethro. Over the doors are the portraits of the two celebrated poets Hafiz and Sadi, at full length; that of Hafiz habited in the old Per&s;ian dre&s;s, painted with a ro&s;y complexion, and a large pair of whi&s;kers, apparently about thirty-&s;ix years old. Sadi is the figure of a venerable old man, with a long beard, turned white with age, in a religious dre&s;s, with long
<PB N="9" REF="10">
flowing robes, holding a &s;mall crook, or ivory &s;taff in his right hand, and a charger of incen&s;e in the other.</P>
<P>Derbend is the capital of Shirvan, and &s;ituated in 42 degrees of north latitude; it is a city of great antiquity, and the only place now &s;tanding on the &s;hores of the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, which has any thing to boa&s;t of. It &s;eems to be admitted, that the greate&s;t part of it was built by Alexander the Great. Derbend has often changed its ma&s;ters, having been &s;everal times in the hands of the Turks. The Tartars are &s;aid to have had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The Ru&s;&s;ians kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for &s;everal years during this century, but it is now again in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Per&s;ians. It is about three Engli&s;h miles long, but not more than half a mile broad, extending from the verge of the &s;hore due we&s;t, up to the foot of a lofty mountain, the whole in a declivity, and its natural &s;ituati|on, is &s;uch, as to form in &s;trict propriety, the gates of Per&s;ia, on this &s;ide; for there is no pa&s;&s;age to the we&s;tward, without going deep into the mountains, which are guarded by their proper inhabitants, who have not &s;ub|mitted to the Per&s;ian yoke. Here is a citadel (with a governor) that mounts 40 pieces of cannon. This city is divided into three parts, each part having its di&s;tinct wall; the upper town, which is half a mile &s;quare, con&s;titutes the citadel; and no per&s;on can enter it, but the &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">The walls of the middle town are about 30 feet high, 20 feet thick at the ba&s;e, and from 12 to 15 at top, having a brea&s;t-work, with port-holes three feet thick. It is defended al&s;o by about &s;ix flanking ba&s;tions. The walls are of a &s;helly &s;tone, &s;trongly ce|mented. How nature has produced the&s;e, or whether they have remained &s;ince the deluge, mu&s;t be left to the curious to determine; we can only ob&s;erve, that &s;uch &s;hells do not appear on any of the Ca&s;pian &s;hores. The rocks about the town are of the &s;ame compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The city gates are very &s;trong, and well made arches, with &s;liding holes to &s;hoot arrows, or throw down &s;tones, from. The &s;treets are not regular, nor were they paved in 1746, though they had been &s;o formerly. It was in this year that the Ru&s;&s;ian amba&s;&s;ador made his entry into Per&s;ia; and Mr. <HI>Van Mierop,</HI> who accompanied him, tells us, that though many of the hou&s;es are &s;up|ported on one &s;ide by the hills, numbers were fallen down, and the greate&s;t part in ruins. It is hardly po&s;|&s;ible to de&s;cribe the mi&s;eries which this place &s;uffered about four years before, when <HI>Nadir Shah,</HI> the Per&s;ian King, came in per&s;on again&s;t the Le&s;gee Tartars. We &s;aw a &s;pecimen of it, &s;ays he, by the carca&s;es of hor&s;es and other animals, which was &s;uffered to remain in the &s;treets, and ruined hou&s;es. We found in this town near 500 men who&s;e eyes <HI>Nadir Shah</HI> had cau&s;ed to be put out at one time. Here is a very mag|nificent mo&s;que, who&s;e roof is &s;upported by 84
<PB N="11" REF="12">
arches, <HI>Nadir</HI> converted it into a barn, and we rode into it, without giving offence. Here are al&s;o &s;everal cara|van&s;eras belonging to the Armenians.</P>
<P>The ea&s;termo&s;t part of the lower town is wa&s;hed by the &s;ea; the walls are guarded by two round ba&s;tions, without which was formerly a harbour for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. <HI>Nadir</HI> built a palace here; cau&s;ed &s;everal &s;treets, or hou&s;es to be erected, and made it a free port, with a view of e&s;tabli&s;hing a great commerce, but it came to nothing, and this part of the town is uninhabited.</P>
<P>On the &s;outh &s;ide of Derbend are many vineyards and gardens, for an extent of eight miles; but the&s;e, as well as their arable lands have partaken the common fate of war. As the neighbourhood of this city is the country of the Le&s;gee Tartars, and as we had not an opportunity of &s;peaking of them, when de&s;cribing the va&s;t extent of Tartary, the reader will doubtle&s;s not be di&s;plea&s;ed at having here &s;ome little account of them, particularly, as it will relieve him from a continued dry de&s;cription of towns and places.</P>
<P>The&s;e Tartars are known to be &s;ome of the brave&s;t people in the world. Their country extends &s;outh from near the latitude of Tarku, about 40 leagues, and 25 we&s;tward. They are under different chiefs, who in ca&s;e of danger to their own common liberty, unite their forces. Some few have been &s;ubjected to the Per&s;ians; but tho&s;e to the north
<PB N="12" REF="13">
and we&s;t of the Per&s;ian dominions, have never &s;ubmitted. They are able to bring 30 or 40,000 men into the field. They have had frequent wars with the Per&s;ians; and, la&s;tly, with <HI>Nadir Shah,</HI> who with 15,000 men pur|&s;ued a great body of them into the hills, but was at la&s;t obliged to retreat with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e Tartars, in flying parties, pillage the Armenians and Georgians, if any &s;tranger travelling into their country, or on the borders of it, &s;eeks their protection, and chu&s;es a guide from among them, let him meet never &s;o &s;trong a party, it is enough, if the guide declares he is his gue&s;t. They are hardly ever known to violate the laws of ho&s;pitality, in any in&s;tance of this nature.</P>
<P>In their per&s;ons, they are well-made, of good &s;tature, and extremely active; their countenance is &s;warthy, their features are regular, and their eyes black, and full of life.</P>
<P>Their dre&s;s re&s;embles the Greek or Arabian manner, many of them wearing the &s;ame kind of drawers, reach|ing to their ancles. Their caps are not &s;o lofty as tho&s;e of the Per&s;ians; neither do all of them wear their beard, &s;ome preferring whi&s;kers only.</P>
<P>They live after the manner of Per&s;ians, profe&s;&s;ing the Mahomedan religion. Their vallies are exceedingly fer|tile,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
producing plenty of wheat, barley, and oats, with abundance of &s;heep, and their hills are covered with vines. They are ingenious in &s;everal manufactures of wool and camels hair; and none of the neighbouring nations equal them in making fire-arms, which they fell to the Per&s;ians. They deal largely in madder. The Armenians trade with the&s;e Tartars, and the&s;e Tartars with the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit Tauris, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ancient Ecbatana. It is called, by the Turks and Per&s;ians, <HI>Ta|briz,</HI> and was the metropolis of Media. <HI>Diodorus Sicu|lus</HI> is of opinion, it was founded by <HI>Semiramis,</HI> who, with incredible labour, brought water there from the moun|tain Orontes; whil&s;t <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that it was built, at lea&s;t a royal palace in it, by the prophet <HI>Daniel.</HI> It was formerly be&s;t known by the name of Ecbatana, and was then in the greate&s;t &s;plendor. The ancients &s;ay, it was 15 miles about, and had walls 70 cubits high and 50 broad: but there is now little or nothing left, either of the walls or palaces. However, Tauris is &s;till a con|&s;iderable town, being five miles round, populous, and a place of great trade. The inhabitants amount to about 80,000.</P>
<P>Tauris, like mo&s;t other cities in Per&s;ia, &s;tands in a plain, &s;urrounded by mountains, from whence there falls a &s;mall &s;tream, which runs through the middle of it; but, when the &s;nows melt, is increa&s;ed to a torrent.
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Here are &s;everal noble meydans or &s;quares, one of them almo&s;t equal to the royal meydan at I&s;pahan. They have al&s;o their covered &s;treets or exchanges, where abun|dance of rich merchandize is expo&s;ed to &s;ale; and their mo&s;ques and bagnios are much after the model of tho&s;e in other cities already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The city of Tauris has al&s;o often changed its ma&s;|ter. Sometimes the Turk, and at others the Per&s;ian has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it; but, as the citizens &s;eem attached to the Per&s;ians, the Turks have &s;everal times burnt and plundered it. Tauris &s;tands about 400 miles north of I&s;pahan, which the caravans u&s;ually travel in 24 days. Its latitude is 38 degrees odd minutes. From the towns and buildings already de&s;cribed, it will be ea&s;y to form a judgment of the re&s;t. I will proceed, therefore, to mention</P>
<P>Teflis, which is the capital of Georgia, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Acropolis of the ancients, which was taken by Pompey, but under the dominion of the Per&s;ians, though inhabited chiefly by chri&s;tians, there being 14 chri&s;tian churches, and not one mahomedan mo&s;que, except that in the ca&s;tle, which &s;tands on an eminence in the center. It is a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, and has a hand&s;ome cathedral, built in form of a cro&s;s. The other churches belong partly to the Georgians, and partly to the Ar|menians. The&s;e, as well as the other public buildings are built of &s;tone, as are their bazars, caravan&s;eras, bag|nios,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
&amp;c. which are after the &s;ame model with tho&s;e in other towns of Per&s;ia. It is large, well peopled, and the hou&s;es built with brick.</P>
<P>The climate of this country, (Georgia,) is &s;oft, not very different from that of Italy. The men are re|markably tall, comely, robu&s;t, and well-made, o&s;ten|tatious, and proud of a &s;plendid appearance. The wo|men, under the name of Circa&s;&s;ians, are celebrated for their beauty all over A&s;ia. I have already treated of Circa&s;&s;ia, which lies much further to the north-we&s;t than Teflis, and have &s;poken of the women of this country.</P>
<P>Teflis is &s;ituated in 44 degrees of north latitude, on the river Kur or Cyrus, at the foot of a mountain; it is not of very large extent, but elegantly built. On the &s;outh &s;ide, on the declivity of the mountain, &s;tands the ca&s;tle, once a place of &s;trength, but hardly tenable at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The next place I &s;hall notice is Gombron, a &s;ea-port town, mo&s;t re&s;orted to of any in the Per&s;ian dominions, and where the Ea&s;t-India Company had a factory above 100 years. It is &s;ituated in 27 degrees 30 minutes north latitude, about 300 miles from Shirauz, is two or three miles round, and &s;tands on a level ground, clo&s;e to the &s;ea, the narrowe&s;t part of the Gulph of Per&s;ia, the country almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly ri&s;ing, every way, for &s;ome
<PB N="16" REF="17">
miles, without any con&s;iderable hill, except towards the north. The coa&s;t of Arabia lies oppo&s;ite to it, at about 10 leagues di&s;tance; but it does not &s;eem to be further over than from Dover to Calais. Be&s;ides the natives, it is inhabited by Engli&s;h, Dutch, Portugue&s;e, Arabs, Jews, Armenians, Banians, and &s;everal other nations, of which the Armenians and Banians are much the greate&s;t merchants. It has a wall towards the land; and towards the &s;ea there are three &s;mall forts, mounted with five guns each, and a platform of eight. There is al&s;o a ca&s;tle, mounted with 35 guns, for the &s;ecurity of the road. The hou&s;es in many of the &s;treets are falling down, the people having the &s;ame humour here as in other parts of Per&s;ia, to let tho&s;e of their ance&s;tors drop, and erect new ones for them&s;elves, through a &s;uper&s;ti|tious opinion, that if the per&s;on who inhabited a hou&s;e, was, in their conceit, unlucky; the next inhabitant of the hou&s;e will be unlucky al&s;o.</P>
<P>The be&s;t hou&s;es are built of &s;tone, brought from the i&s;lands of Ki&s;hee or Larrak; but they are generally built of brick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;un-dried. They have &s;ometimes two &s;tories, and a wooden contrivance to &s;trike the wind down into the lower rooms. The&s;e machines are about 10 feet high, and look like towers. The hou&s;es belonging to the Engli&s;h and Dutch Ea&s;t-India companies, are as well built as any in the town. But the Engli&s;h Factors, are mo&s;t of them removed to Bo&s;&s;ora, at the bottom of the
<PB N="17" REF="18">
Gulph, in the Turki&s;h territories, which is the la&s;t city I &s;hall take any notice of.</P>
<P>Bo&s;&s;ora, or Bu&s;&s;ora, is &s;ituated in latitude 31 degrees 30 minutes north, on the banks of a fre&s;h-water river, which is a branch of the Euphrates. The city is a large one, but indifferently fortified. A mud-wall encircles the town, with mud-ba&s;tions and turrets. It had former|ly a wet fo&s;&s;e, which is now dried up in many parts; but notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;advantages, it held out upwards of eight months in 1777, when be&s;ieged by the Per&s;ians. Here is a grand mo&s;que, and a convent of Italian mi&s;|&s;ionaries. Although the Great De&s;art extends to the walls of the city, the banks of the river, on each &s;ide, are very fertile and plea&s;ant. Their fields produce corn, pul&s;e, rice, and &s;everal European fruits; and the coun|try round abounds in game.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the principal cities in exi&s;tence, I will mention one now in ruins; but for its antiquity and grandeur, better worth a de&s;cription than any we have dwelt on. This is the famous city of Per&s;epolis, where are found the noble&s;t ruins, of an ancient palace or tem|ple, that are now to be &s;een on the face of the earth. Even Rome it&s;elf, they &s;ay, is nothing, compared with the&s;e venerable remains of antiquity. The place at this day is called <HI>Chilmanar</HI> or forty pillars. It is &s;ituated about 50 miles north-ea&s;t of Shirauz.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">It is &s;eated at the foot of a mountain, at the north-ea&s;t end of that &s;pacious plain, where Per&s;epolis once &s;tood, and generally held to be part of the palace of <HI>Darius,</HI> who was conquered by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great. It &s;tands on a ri&s;ing ground; and the adjoining mountains encircle it in form of an amphitheatre. We a&s;cend to the pillars, by a grand flight of &s;teps of blue &s;tone, 104 in number, 30 feet in length, and 20 inches broad, &s;o that a hor&s;e may ea&s;ily go up or down them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> &s;ays, it was built upon a mountain of dark coloured marble, and the &s;teps hewed out of the &s;olid rock; but tho&s;e who have viewed it more accurately &s;ince, ob&s;erve that the &s;teps are compo&s;ed of large &s;tones fifteen or &s;ixteen feet long, and of &s;uch a thickne&s;s that &s;ix or &s;even &s;teps are cut out of one &s;tone; and the whole being &s;o artificially joined, that they appear to be but one piece.</P>
<P>The &s;tairca&s;e divides, as you a&s;cend, one flight wind|ing to the right, and the other to the left, having a wall on each &s;ide, and a ballu&s;trade on the other. After|wards both flights, or branches, turn again, and end at a &s;quare landing-place, from whence you go into a portico of white marble, 20 feet wide. On it are carved in <HI>ba&s;&s;o relievo</HI> two bea&s;ts, as large as elephants, but their bodies like hor&s;es, with the feet and tails of oxen. Ten feet farther &s;tand two fluted columns of whiti&s;h &s;tone, about &s;ix feet high, be&s;ide their capitals and
<PB N="19" REF="20">
ba&s;es, and as thick as three men can fathom round. A little farther, &s;tand two pilla&s;ters, embelli&s;hed with two &s;phinxes of an immen&s;e &s;ize, dre&s;&s;ed out with a profu&s;ion of bead-work, repre&s;ented &s;tanding. On the &s;ides above are in&s;criptions of an ancient character, which no one yet hath been able to decypher. Beyond this portal, is another flight of &s;teps, leading to the grand hall of co|lumns, on its &s;ides, or walls, are a variety of figures in <HI>ba&s;&s;o relievo,</HI> a kind of triumph, con&s;i&s;ting of a great train of people, in di&s;tinct companies, &s;ome carrying banners, others offerings; after all, comes a car drawn by &s;everal hor&s;es, with a little altar on it, from whence fire &s;eems to a&s;cend. At the head of the &s;tair-ca&s;e is another <HI>ba&s;&s;o relievo,</HI> repre&s;enting a lion &s;eizing a bull, cut with great exactne&s;s, and clo&s;e to this, are other in&s;criptions in ancient characters. On the top of the &s;econd &s;taircai&s;e is a &s;quare place, which has been &s;ur|rounded with columns, to which the name of forty pillars has been given. Although a va&s;t number of ages have elap&s;ed &s;ince the foundation of this building, fifteen of the colums remain yet entire; they are from &s;eventy to eighty feet in height, and are ma&s;terly pieces of ma&s;onry; their pede&s;tals are curiou&s;ly worked, and appear little injured by the hand of Time; the &s;hafts are fluted to the top, and the capitals are adorned with a profu&s;ion of frieze-work.</P>
<P>From this hall we proceed ea&s;tward, till we arrive at the remains of a large &s;quare building, to which we
<PB N="20" REF="21">
enter through a door of granite. Mo&s;t of the doors and windows of this apartment are &s;till &s;tanding; they are of black marble, and poli&s;hed like a mirror: on the &s;ides of the entrance are ba&s;s-reliefs of two figures at full length, repre&s;enting a man &s;tabbing a goat: over another door is the repre&s;entation of two men at full length; behind &s;tands a dome&s;tic, holding a &s;pread umbrella. At the &s;outh entrance of this room, are two large pillars, on which are cut four figures dre&s;&s;ed in long garments, holding in their hands &s;pears ten feet in length. Va&s;t numbers of broken pillars, &s;hafts and capitals are &s;cattered over a con&s;iderable extent of ground, &s;ome of them of &s;uch enormous &s;ize, that it is wonderful how they could have been brought whole, and &s;et up together. Indeed, every part of the remains of the&s;e noble ruins indicate their former grandeur, truly worthy of being the re&s;idence of a great and powerful monarch, and whil&s;t viewing them, the mind becomes impre&s;&s;ed with an awful &s;olemnity. When we con&s;ider the celebrity of this va&s;t empire, once the patron of the arts and &s;ciences, and the &s;eat of a wi&s;e and flouri&s;hing government; when we reflect on the various changes and revolutions it has undergone; at one period, a field for the daring ambition of an <HI>Alex|ander,</HI> at another, for the enthu&s;ia&s;m of an <HI>Omar;</HI> we mu&s;t feel the &s;tronge&s;t conviction of the mutability of all human events. There are the remains of other buildings, reaching up the &s;ide of the mountains, equally magnificent and beautiful in their ruins, with
<PB N="21" REF="22">
human figures cut on the walls, carrying bows and arrows and &s;pears in their hands, all of them with caps in the form of turrets, which was the mode of head|dre&s;s among the ancient Medes. Sir <HI>John Chardin,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Le Brun,</HI> have given it as their opinion, that this place was the &s;epulture of the ancient kings of Per&s;ia. The modern natives call this place the a&s;&s;embly of king <HI>Gem&s;heed,</HI> and &s;ay, that prince u&s;ed to vi&s;it it, with the nobles and great men of his court, in order to enjoy a delightful view of the adjacent country, of which there cannot be a finer pro&s;pect than from hence. In another place, clo&s;e by, we a&s;cend by a &s;tone &s;taircai&s;e, into a magnificent court of a quadrangular form, &s;everal pe|de&s;tals of pillars, and the remains of two grand portals, all of granite, are &s;till vi&s;ible, and the cornices of the portals are perfect. On many of the broken pieces of the pillars are ancient in&s;criptions. In &s;everal parts of this palace are &s;tone aqueducts, cut under ground, eight feet deep, and a half broad, made with a de&s;ign to carry off the water running down from the mountains.</P>
<P>The&s;e venerable ruins have &s;uffered much from the ravages of time; but what &s;till remains of them are as hard and durable as the &s;oil they &s;tand on; they are covered with in&s;criptions, Mr. <HI>Niebur</HI> has given them all in his &s;econd volume, mo&s;t elegantly and accurately copied; but the mo&s;t learned, and be&s;t acquainted with the ea&s;tern languages have been baffled in every attempt to make out their meaning. It is one of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
<PB N="22" REF="23">
difficulties to &s;olve, when, and by whom, this palace was originally built. The Grecian hi&s;torians have given very imperfect accounts of it; and the Per|&s;ians no le&s;s &s;o. By the pre&s;ent natives, Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;ays, the place is called <HI>Tukht Gem&s;heed,</HI> or the throne of King <HI>Gem&s;hed,</HI> who they affirm built it, between three and four thou&s;and years ago. It is related in Grecian hi&s;tory, that <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, &s;et fire to, and de|&s;troyed, the whole city of Per&s;epolis, the noble&s;t and wealthie&s;t city in the world, with this rich and &s;plendid palace, about the year of the world 3724, or 280 years before Chri&s;t; in&s;tigated to it in a fit of de|bauchery, by the celebrated courtezan <HI>Thais,</HI> the Athe|nian, in revenge for the towns the Per&s;ian emperor had &s;troyed in Greece. But this &s;tory, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> though it has the &s;anction of hi&s;tory, if we reflect on what &s;till remains of the&s;e ruins, any one on viewing them would &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch an event impo&s;&s;ible to have taken place. He might have burned the city, but of &s;uch a nature are the remains of the palace, that all the fire that could be applied to them, would not make the &s;malle&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the&s;e huge ma&s;&s;es of &s;tone, equal in point of durability and hardne&s;s to the &s;olid rock.</P>
<P>It is to be remarked, that in the figures throughout the whole of the palace, the rules of art are not attended to. The mu&s;cles of the figures are wanting; yet the drapery is finely done; and the proportions, in general, are well kept up, though the contour is only ob&s;erved, which gives a &s;amene&s;s to the whole. Sir <HI>John Chardin</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="24">
&s;ays, whoever was the architect, was ignorant of Grecian and of Roman architecture, and &s;uppo&s;es the defects I have mentioned, were occa&s;ioned by fini&s;hing the work in a hurry; but, on the other hand, it is more natural to conceive the work altogether to have been the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of tho&s;e days, as the ornaments of the palace of Shirauz, are in the &s;ame &s;tile as the&s;e at Per&s;epolis, and as the architecture of the pre&s;ent Per&s;ians, is &s;imilar to that of ancient times.</P>
<P>The materials of which the ruins con&s;i&s;t, are chiefly hard, blue &s;tone; but the doors and windows of the apart|ments are all of black marble, and &s;o beautiful and highly poli&s;hed, that we may &s;ee our faces in them. One of the principal things worthy admiration, is the immen&s;e &s;trength of the foundation. The whole of the palace takes in a circumference of 1400 &s;quare yards. The front is 600 paces from north to &s;outh, and 390 from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The height of the foundation, in front, is in &s;everal parts from 40 to 50 feet, and con&s;i&s;ts of two immen&s;e &s;tones laid together. It is much to be feared that in the cour&s;e of a few centuries, earthquakes may de&s;troy the columns, and remaining apartments; but, whatever may be their fate, the foundations mu&s;t endure, until the rock on which it is built &s;hall cea&s;e to exi&s;t.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the People.</HEAD>
<P>THE modern Per&s;ians are, in many re&s;pects, a hand&s;ome people; they are per&s;onable men, of a good &s;tature, well-&s;haped, clean-limbed, and of agree|able features; and in Georgia and the Northern Pro|vinces, of an admirable fair complexion; towards the &s;outh, they are a little upon the olive. They are al&s;o robu&s;t, warlike, and hardy; and are now all become &s;oldiers. Their eyes and their hair are generally black. In mo&s;t parts of the country, the men &s;have their heads very clo&s;e; but the young men have often a lock on each temple. Their cheeks are &s;haved, but the beard on their chin reaches up to their temples. Their prie&s;ts and religious men wear their beards long, only clip them into form, and the common people cut theirs pretty &s;hort. But none &s;uffer any hair to grow on their bodies. Mo&s;t of the men have cloth-caps, which ri&s;e ten or twelve inches, and terminate at the top in four corners. They wear a &s;horter cap in &s;ummer, faced with grey Bucharian lamb-&s;kin. Their ears, which are very large, are always left ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and generally hang down, owing to the weight of their caps; and many are proud to &s;hew that their ears are not cut off. Crim&s;on is a colour they much affect in their caps, as well as in their outward garments, and it makes a grand appearance. Deep

blue is the colour of their mourning. The better &s;ort of people wear a &s;ack of Kermania wool, wrapped about their heads as turbans. Some of the&s;e are &s;o exceeding fine as to co&s;t 1000 crowns, (25<HI>l.</HI> Engli&s;h,) and the com|mon price for &s;uch as are good is eight or ten crowns, and their &s;a&s;hes co&s;t from 5<HI>l.</HI> to 12<HI>l.</HI> each. Their heads are thus kept very warm, and the more &s;o as they &s;el|dom pull off their caps, but wear them even in the pre|&s;ence of their King. Next their &s;kins they wear a &s;hirt (if it may be &s;o called) of coloured &s;ilk or callico, ge|nerally blue or chequered, which they wear out without ever wa&s;hing it. This &s;hirt has an open bo&s;om, without neck or wri&s;tbands, and is made clo&s;e to the arm. They have a pair of drawers or trow&s;ers, clo&s;e before, which reaches half down their legs. Their &s;tockings are made of woollen cloth, but not at all &s;haped to the leg, &s;itting loo&s;e like boots, but in general they only wear woollen trow&s;ers, which reach over the ancles. Over the &s;hirt they wear a wai&s;tcoat, and upon the&s;e they wear a coat, with clo&s;e &s;leeves, and buttons and loops before, tied with a &s;a&s;h. This coat is wide at bottom, and hangs like a bell or hoop, a little below their knees. Be&s;ides, they put or frequently another coat, without &s;leeves, the upper coat being the &s;horte&s;t; and in the winter-time, over all, they wear another coat lined with furs. The&s;e fur-coats are as often worn for &s;tate as for warmth; for it is common to &s;ee a great man &s;it in his fable-coat in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer. In&s;tead of &s;hoes they have piqued &s;lippers, without quarters, turned up at the to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and
<PB N="26" REF="28">
made of Turkey leather, neither tied nor buckled; &s;ome are made of &s;hagreen, being the &s;kin of hor&s;e's rumps, prepared hard and tough like &s;eal's &s;kin, and with &s;uch high heels, that though they are calculated to carry them out of the dirt, are extremely uneafy to tho&s;e who are not accu&s;tomed to them. When they ride, they have boots of yellow leather. Their bridles, &s;addles, and hou&s;ings, are immoderately fine, the la&s;t being a cloth of gold, and &s;o large as almo&s;t to hide the hind-quarters of the hor&s;e. The outer garment of the common people is a &s;light cotton: in general, they wear two or three light ve&s;tments, and reaching only to their knees, it gives them a great advantage over the Turks, who wear long effeminate robes. Silk is worn, in &s;ummer, by men of di&s;tinction, e&s;pecially for under-garments; and the&s;e as well as their cotton and woollen under-garments are quilted, of cour&s;e, warm and light. Under the &s;a&s;h, round the wai&s;t, they carry a long, pointed knife, mount|ed with gold or &s;ilver, and &s;heathed; and this, whether on foot or on hor&s;eback. Ladies they &s;ay do the &s;ame. Writers carry their pen and ink about them.</P>
<P>The women about Shirauz have, at all times, been celebrated over tho&s;e of other parts of Per&s;ia, for their beauty, and not without rea&s;on. They are tall and well-&s;haped; but their bright and &s;parkling eyes is a &s;triking beauty. This, however, is, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to art; for they rub their eye-brows and eye-lids with the black flower of antimony, which adds an incomparable
<PB N="27" REF="29">
brilliancy to their natural lu&s;tre. As the women in Mahomedan countries are, down to the meane&s;t, covered with a veil from head to foot, a &s;ight is never to be obtained of them in the &s;treet; but living, as Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> did, in the family of a Per&s;ian, he had many opportunities of &s;eeing them unveiled. The females, &s;ays <HI>Hanway,</HI> who do not labour in the field, are &s;eldom &s;een abroad, except in a morning, before the &s;un ri&s;es, and then they are covered with veils, which reach to their feet. When they travel on hor&s;eback, every lady of di&s;tinction is not only veiled, but has generally a &s;ervant who runs, or rides, before her to clear the way; and on &s;uch occa|&s;ions the men, even in the market-place, always turn their backs till the women are pa&s;t, it being deemed the highe&s;t ill manners to look at them. The care which they take to conceal their faces, to avoid the imputation of acting indelicately, and contrary to cu&s;tom; has made &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion on them, that if a woman was accidentally &s;urprized, &s;he would &s;hew her whole per&s;on rather than her face.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the women is &s;imple, differing from the men, rather for the di&s;tinction of &s;exes, than otherwi&s;e. They wear neither turbans on the head, nor &s;a&s;hes about their wai&s;t, and their coats or ve&s;ts reach almo&s;t down to their heels. They adorn their arms with brace|lets, and their heads with jewels of &s;everal kinds: one of the&s;e is compo&s;ed of a light, gold chain-work, &s;et with &s;mall pearls, with a thin, gold-plate pendant, about the
<PB N="28" REF="30">
&s;ize of a crown-piece, on which is engraved an Arabian prayer; this is fixed to the hair at the upper part of the temple, and hangs upon the cheek, below the ear, or is bound round the arm. They have large ear-rings, and &s;ome, bordering on India, wear gold rings &s;et with pearls in their no&s;trils. The poorer &s;ort wear the &s;ame things in ba&s;er metal. Their hair hangs in tre&s;&s;es, falling down the back. Their &s;hirts, as well as the men's, are of a thin manufacture of &s;ilk and cotton; but the&s;e are open at the brea&s;t, in the manner of men's &s;hirts in Europe, whil&s;t the men's are &s;upported on the left &s;houlder by a &s;mall button: the women al&s;o wear drawers and &s;lippers as the men.</P>
<P>Some girls wear a &s;tiffened cap upon their heads, turned up before like a hunting cap, with a heron's feather in it. Neither men nor women wear gloves, but their fingers are full of rings, as their arms are of brace|lets. They wear necklaces of gold or pearl, hanging down on the bo&s;om, with a locket full of perfume.</P>
<P>As black hair, and large, black eyes are mo&s;t common, &s;o are they mo&s;t in e&s;teem, and the thicke&s;t and broade&s;t eye-brows are thought the fine&s;t. The women, if their eye-brows be not black, will, as I have ob&s;erved, colour them; and are accu&s;tomed to paint their faces, and rub their hands and feet with Hannay, a kind of orange-coloured pomatum.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31">As the cloaths, both of the men and women, are of the riche&s;t flowered and brocaded &s;ilks, it appears that dre&s;s is no incon&s;iderable article in Per&s;ia, particularly as per&s;ons of &s;mall fortune endeavour to vie with their &s;uperiors, and will have fine cloaths, though they want food. Tho&s;e who wear &s;ables, which they will not be without, if they can purcha&s;e them, &s;eldom pay le&s;s than an hundred pounds for a clo&s;e-bodied coat. All this, with the rich trappings of their hor&s;es, when they ride, which they do almo&s;t every day (if they go but a &s;tone's throw) mu&s;t amount to a va&s;t &s;um; and this keeps them poor. However, as there are no where more per&s;onable men, finer hor&s;es, or richer equipages, the Per&s;ians are allowed to make as &s;plendid a figure as any people what|ever. Poverty may prey on them at home, but they are loaded with gold and jewels abroad; and as they have always a clear &s;un-&s;hine and bright heaven, the&s;e ca&s;t a more than ordinary lu&s;tre on their per&s;ons; and their finery is &s;et off to the greate&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>In point of dre&s;s, the Per&s;ians differ remarkably from the Turks; for in Turkey any per&s;on who is not a Sei&ugrave;d, or de&s;cendant of the prophet, wearing the lea&s;t green upon his garments, would mo&s;t probably be &s;toned: whereas in Per&s;ia, green is the general and favourite colour, even to their &s;hoes. A Turk al&s;o thinks him&s;elf defiled by the touch of a chri&s;tian, even on his garments. The Per&s;ians, on the contrary, will
<PB N="30" REF="32">
eat out of the &s;ame plate, drink out of the &s;ame cup, and &s;moak out of the &s;ame calean.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians, in their di&s;po&s;itions, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> are much inclined to &s;udden anger, are quick, fiery, and very &s;en&s;ible of affronts, which they re&s;ent on the &s;pot; but they are not vindictive; and yet, if their kindne&s;s to their be&s;t friends happens to be turned by the fortune of war into enmity, they often become in&s;en&s;ible: this &s;eems to be more owing to a cu&s;tom of cruelty, than a revengeful di&s;po&s;ition. On the other hand, there are not many in&s;tances of the placable temper which the chri&s;tian religion &s;o &s;trongly recommends. In theory, however, they are friends to this virtue, and apparently exceed the chri&s;tians in the duty of re&s;ignation. They are of a &s;edentary turn, and delight in &s;itting &s;till and mu&s;ing. I never found any of them, &s;ays <HI>Hanway,</HI> walk in their apartments, as the Engli&s;h often do. A Turk being on board an Engli&s;h man of war, enquired very &s;eriou&s;ly, if the people were troubled with an evil &s;pirit, becau&s;e, &s;ays he, they are never at re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians are certainly a brave and courageous people; but their frequent wars have much depraved their ancient urbanity of manners, and introduced a &s;trife peculiar to the lower cla&s;s of people: when two per&s;ons begin fighting, it always rai&s;es a great croud, who gene|rally enter into the conte&s;t, and the whole pre&s;ently becomes a &s;cene of tumult and confu&s;ion, until the arrival of the
<PB N="31" REF="33">
D&agrave;roga, or judge of the police, who puts an end to the fray. Ho&s;pitality is a part of their religion. On occa|&s;ions of the lea&s;t intercour&s;e, men of any di&s;tinction invite &s;trangers as well as their friends to their table, and it is remarkable how they pride them&s;elves in other te&s;timonies of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>They are naturally inclined to temperance, and, with regard to diet, &s;eem to be more in a &s;tate of nature than the Europeans. By way of amu&s;ement, they u&s;e opiates, but not near &s;o much as the Turks. The following is their mode of living. They always ri&s;e at day-break, in order to perform their devotions. Their fir&s;t prayer is &s;aid before &s;un-ri&s;e, after which they breakfa&s;t: this con&s;i&s;ts of grapes, or any other fruits of the &s;ea&s;on, with a little bread, and chee&s;e made of goats-milk; they then drink a cup of very &s;trong coffee, without milk or &s;ugar; and then the calean, or pipe, is introduced, the &s;moke of which is contrived to be drawn through a ba&s;on of cold water; for the Per&s;ians of all ranks &s;moak tobacco.</P>
<P>Their &s;econd time of prayer is repeated when the &s;un declines from the meridian, &s;oon after which they dine. Their dinner con&s;i&s;ts of curds, bread, and fruits of va|rious kinds, animal food not being u&s;ual at this meal. The third hour of prayer is about four o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34">The fourth hour of prayer is after &s;un-&s;et. When this is fini&s;hed, the Per&s;ians eat their principal meal, or &s;upper. This generally con&s;i&s;ts of pilau, which is boiled rice, well buttered and &s;ea&s;oned, with a fowl, a piece of mutton, or a kid, &s;erved up with it, and &s;ometimes coloured with &s;affion, or curry; &s;ometimes they eat roa&s;t meat. When the meal is ready, a &s;ervant brings notice of it, and at the &s;ame time brings an ewer and water to wa&s;h their hands, which is an invariable cu&s;tom with them, both before and after eating. They eat very quick, conveying their food to their mouths with their fingers, knives and forks being unknown in Per&s;ia, and grea&s;e their chins and beards as much as their fingers. Sherbets of different &s;orts are introduced, and the meal concludes with a de&s;ert of de|licious fruits. The &s;upper being fini&s;hed, the family &s;it in a circle, and entertain each other by relating &s;tories, (of which they are exce&s;&s;ively fond,) and al&s;o of repeating pa&s;&s;ages from the works of their mo&s;t favourite poets, and amu&s;ing them&s;elves at various kinds of games; and it is worthy of remark, that when the olde&s;t man in com|pany &s;peaks, though poor, and at the lower-end of the room, he is always attended to. The fifth, or la&s;t, prayer is &s;aid about an hour after &s;upper.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hanway</HI> &s;upped once with a man of di&s;tinction, and de&s;cribes it as follows: Supper being brought in, a &s;ervant pre&s;ented a ba&s;on of water, and a napkin hung over his &s;houlders. He went to every one in the com|pany, and poured water on their hands to wa&s;h. In the
<PB N="33" REF="35">
court-yard &s;tood a lamp, which was &s;upplied with tallow, and in the middle of the room, upon the floor, was one large wax candle, which they &s;nuffed with &s;ci&s;&s;ars into a tea-cup of water. A large &s;alver; in form of a tea-board, was &s;et for every per&s;on, covered with a plate of Pilau, in which was a &s;mall quantity of mince-meat, mixed up with fruit and &s;pices. There were al&s;o plates of comfits, &s;everal china ba&s;ons of &s;herbets, as &s;weet, &s;our, and other waters, with cakes of rice, and others of wheat-flour, on which were &s;prinkled the &s;eeds of poppies, and others of the like nature. As they e&s;teem it an abomination to cut either bread, or any kind of meat after it is dre&s;&s;ed, the&s;e cakes are made thin, that they may be ea&s;ily broken with the hand, and their meat, which is generally mutton or fowls, is &s;o prepared that they divide it with their fingers. Pork is never eaten here, nor veal, and beef but &s;eldom; nor do they eat hares, or other animals forbidden by the Jews. They u&s;e no beaten pepper, only whole pepper. They never &s;alt their meat, nor is &s;alt ever brought to table. They dre&s;s their meat and fowls the day they are killed, and put by nothing to be cold. They &s;it down on the floor, cro&s;s-legged, at their meals, and a cloth is &s;pread on the carpet. In common families, the per&s;on who has the pro|vi&s;ion before him, di&s;tributes it to the company. They u&s;e no &s;poons, except for &s;oups or liquid, and take up their rice by handfuls, as do the people in India. They wa&s;h their hands, before and after meals, and wipe them in their handkerchiefs. Common people at I&s;pahan, &s;el|dom
<PB N="34" REF="36">
dre&s;s their food at home, but when they have &s;hut up their &s;hops, go to an eating-hou&s;e, and buy Pilau for their families. It is remarked of the Per&s;ians, that &s;o far from &s;hutting their doors at meal-times, they invite all to eat, that come to their hou&s;es at that time, remem|bering to this day the ho&s;pitality of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and ob|&s;erving, that, had he not been of a ho&s;pitable di&s;po|&s;ition, he, probably, had mi&s;&s;ed the honour of entertaining three angels: every man may retire from an entertain|ment, without ceremony, and what they leave, of meats, is always given to the poor.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on makes an entertainment, it is u&s;ually a &s;upper; notwith&s;tanding which the gue&s;ts generally come at 9 or 10 in the morning and &s;pend the whole day. They di&s;cour&s;e, they &s;moak, eat &s;weat-meats, and pa&s;s away the time, in a thou&s;and amu&s;ements. Some|times they hear heroic poems, in honour of their prince. Sometimes &s;inging-women are introduced, who &s;ing, dance, and play, and &s;hew a number of antic tricks, to divert the company, and if any of the gue&s;ts are di&s;|po&s;ed to withdraw with any of the&s;e dancing girls, they are &s;hewn into a private room, and when they return, no one takes any notice of it. Wine they have none, but their u&s;ual drink is &s;herbets and water, cooled in &s;ummer-time with ice. The officers of the army will indulge with wine, and other per&s;ons drink under a pre|tence of doing it for their health, but the chief of what is here made, is tran&s;ported to neighbouring countries, or
<PB N="35" REF="37">
drank by chri&s;tians in Per&s;ia. But they rai&s;e their &s;pirits with opium. Mankind &s;eem generally to confe&s;s that they cannot &s;u&s;tain the cares and inquietudes of life, without &s;ome &s;uch expedient. What is tobacco but an opiate? It is not the &s;mell or ta&s;te we are enamoured with, but it lulls men into plea&s;ing thoughts. Within an hour after they have taken a pill of opium, it begins to operate; and a thou&s;and plea&s;ant &s;cenes pre&s;ent them|&s;elves to their imagination, they laugh, they &s;ing, and &s;ay abundance of droll things, like men intoxicated with wine; but when the effect of it is gone off, they find their &s;pirits exhau&s;ted, and grow pen&s;ive and melancholy, till they repeat the do&s;e; and the longer they have been u&s;ed to it, the greater proportion they mu&s;t take to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, &s;o that &s;ome take as much at one time as would de&s;troy half a dozen Europeans. A decoction of poppy-&s;eed is &s;old al&s;o in mo&s;t cities in Per&s;ia, and in the&s;e hou&s;es we &s;hall &s;ee people eating and talking as ridiculou&s;ly as men do when they are drunk. If there is any rea&s;on in the prohibition of wine, it is to prevent people playing the fool, and injuring their health, which is as effectually done by opium as by wine.</P>
<P>In their conver&s;ation, the Per&s;ians aim much at ele|gance, and are perpetually repeating ver&s;es and pa&s;&s;ages from the works of their mo&s;t favourite poets, <HI>Hafiz, S&agrave;di,</HI> and <HI>J&agrave;mi,</HI> a practice univer&s;al from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t; for tho&s;e who have not the advantages of education, make &s;hift thus to bear their part in conver&s;a|tion,
<PB N="36" REF="38">
by remembering what they hear. They delight al&s;o in jokes and quaint expre&s;&s;ions, and are fond of playing upon each other, which they &s;ometimes do with great ele|gance and irony. There is one thing much to be ad|mired in their conver&s;ations, which is the &s;trict attention they pay to the per&s;on &s;peaking, whom they never inter|rupt on any account.</P>
<P>They are &s;o accu&s;tomed in their common di&s;cour&s;e to u&s;e extravagant and hyperbolical compliments, on the mo&s;t trifling occa&s;ions, that it would, at fir&s;t, in&s;pire a &s;tranger with an idea, that every inhabitant of the place was willing to lay down his life, &s;hed his blood, or &s;pend his money, in his &s;ervice; and this mode of addre&s;s (which in fact means nothing) is practi&s;ed not only among the genteel people, but even among the meane&s;t artificers. Freedom of conver&s;ation is a thing totally unknown here; as, that walls have ears, is pro|verbially in the mouth of every one. The fear of chains, which bind their bodies, has al&s;o en&s;laved their minds; and their addre&s;s to men of &s;uperior rank to them&s;elves, is marked with &s;igns of the mo&s;t abject and &s;lavi&s;h &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, while, on the contrary, as all men of this &s;tamp are, they are as haughty and overbearing to their inferiors.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians, with re&s;pect to outward behaviour, are certainly the Pari&s;ians of the ea&s;t. Whil&s;t a rude and in&s;olent demeanor marks the character of the Turki&s;h nation towards foreigners and chri&s;tians, the behaviour
<PB N="37" REF="39">
of the Per&s;ians would, on the contrary, do honour to the mo&s;t civilized nations. They are kind, courteous, civil, and obliging, to all &s;trangers, without being guided by tho&s;e religious prejudices &s;o prevalent in every other mahomedan country. They are fond of enquiring after the manners and cu&s;toms of Europe, and, in re|turn, very readily afford any information in re&s;pect to their own country. Ho&s;pitality is, with them, &s;o great a virtue, that a man thinks him&s;elf highly honoured, if you will enter his hou&s;e, and partake of what it affords; whereas, going out of a hou&s;e, without &s;moking a ca|lean, or taking &s;ome refre&s;hment, is a high affront. They &s;ay, that every meal a &s;tranger partakes with them brings a ble&s;&s;ing on the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The ancient Per&s;ians are recorded to have taught their children a mo&s;t exact reverence for truth; but the pre|&s;ent generation are as notorious for fal&s;ehood; they poi&s;on with a &s;weet-meat, in always &s;aying what is plea&s;ing, whether it be true or not. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;ays, they are the greate&s;t liars in the world, practi&s;ing the mo&s;t im|probable fal&s;ities with the grave&s;t air imaginable, and &s;o far from being aba&s;hed by a detection, they always en|deavour to turn it off with a laugh; and even confe&s;s them&s;elves, that they think there is no harm in tel|ling a lie, provided it turns out of any benefit to them&s;elves; and they will always, in every bu&s;ine&s;s they are engaged in, fir&s;t endeavour to bring it about by lying and knavery; which if un&s;ucce&s;sful in, (tho&s;e with whom they have to deal being fully as expert as them|&s;elves,)
<PB N="38" REF="40">
they will then conclude the bargain with truth and hone&s;ty; but either way to them is equally indifferent. In their di&s;po&s;itions, they are chearful, but rather inclined to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s than loud mirth.</P>
<P>They are very eager to gain money, and are lavi&s;h in expending it. When they have furni&s;hed them&s;elves with an equipage, a hou&s;e, and gardens, agreeable to their wi&s;hes, they will, rather than lay by their money, lay it out in building caravan&s;eras, mo&s;ques, and on other public occa&s;ions, in&s;omuch that travellers ob&s;erve, that there are no people in the world that take le&s;s thought for the morrow. A man to whom a fortune of 10,000<HI>l.</HI> &s;hall fall, will in a few months lay it out in purcha&s;ing wives and &s;laves, cloaths and furniture, without con|&s;idering where he is to get more, and in two or three months after this, will di&s;po&s;e of what he has bought, for pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This <HI>Chardin</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, he has &s;een in a thou&s;and in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Another charge again&s;t the Per&s;ians is, that they are much addicted to women, and the rea&s;on alledged is, that they have &s;everal wives and concubines; but whether any other people would not have as many, if their laws per|mitted them, is a que&s;tion, e&s;pecially if they were taught, as the mahomedans are, that the enjoyment of women will con&s;titute a great part of their happine&s;s in the next world, as well as in this. Surely tho&s;e nations may, with more rea&s;on, be charged with la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, who
<PB N="39" REF="41">
break through all re&s;traints both civil and religious, and fly at the whole &s;ex, even the wives and daughters of their mo&s;t intimate friends and acquaintance. But if it be true that the Per&s;ians admire boys, and that every great man has his <HI>Ganymede,</HI> it is a crime, they are ju&s;tly to be dete&s;ted for. This, however, &s;eems to intimate that they have le&s;s re&s;pect for the fair &s;ex than they ought, and contradicts the former charge.</P>
<P>The notion which the Per&s;ians have imbibed con|cerning the female world, prevents their being involved in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of love, &s;uch as lo&s;ing their &s;en&s;es for the &s;ake of a woman, though they are betrayed into many improprieties of conduct on this account. Jealou&s;y, which generally prevails in the warme&s;t climates, is not unknown to the heart of a Per&s;ian; the nearer approach to the &s;un may affect mahomedans as well as chri&s;tians; but as, in the politer countries of Chri&s;tendom, women are generally con&s;idered on an equality with men, and, in Per&s;ia, as much inferior to them, there mu&s;t, con&s;e|quently, among chri&s;tians, be a greater regard to con|jugal love. The difference in religion, as well as in the cu&s;toms and manners of countries, will hardly admit a compari&s;on; but as jealou&s;y &s;ometimes occa&s;ions the in|fidelity of women in Europe, it is always a &s;afeguard to them in A&s;ia, where they are never con&s;tituted the guardians of their own honour.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42">We find cu&s;tom has a great influence on the manners of mankind in all countries. In France, there is a more liberal indulgence to women than in England; and yet, contrary to this rule, it is beyond di&s;pute, that Engli&s;h wives greatly exceed the French in cha&s;tity. This I take to be owing to the natural gaiety of the French, which puts them more off their guard, whereas a more &s;erious turn of mind creates an awe, and keeps the enemy at a di&s;tance. On the other hand, in Portugal, and other countries in the &s;outh of Europe, where jea|lou&s;y mo&s;t abounds, and where the lea&s;t confidence is re|po&s;ed in women, there is the mo&s;t incontinence; &s;o that it is hard to &s;ay, whether jealou&s;y has tended mo&s;t to this immorality, or this immorality e&s;tabli&s;hed jea|lou&s;y as a kind of natural vice.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, whether it is from jealou&s;y, or what other cau&s;e, there is no part of the world where the women are &s;o &s;trictly guarded as in Per&s;ia. Even in the Indies and Turkey, neighbouring kingdoms, they live in free|dom in compari&s;on with the&s;e. For though a hu&s;band &s;hould have the greate&s;t indifference for his wife, yet the reflection a wife's imprudent conduct ca&s;ts upon her hu&s;band, is more than he is able to bear; and as a woman is here con&s;idered as polluted, if &s;he &s;uffers a man to ca&s;t but an eye upon her; and both her and her hu&s;band's honour is lo&s;t by her appearing in public, it is no won|der their apartments are &s;o &s;trictly guarded. If this furious love and jealou&s;y, was the con&s;equence of the
<PB N="41" REF="43">
climate, it would at all times have been the &s;ame; but we find, in the days of the patriarch <HI>Abraham,</HI> who lived on the confines of this country, the women en|joyed as great a liberty as with us, or <HI>Sarah's</HI> beauty would not have brought her hu&s;band's life in danger. We find al&s;o <HI>Aha&s;uerus,</HI> king of this very country, left <HI>Haman</HI> in the room with his beloved queen, whil&s;t he retired to his garden; and <HI>E&s;ther</HI> made entertainment for the great lords of the court, and was there in per&s;on; which &s;ufficiently &s;hews that they allowed the ladies as great liberties in Per&s;ia, in tho&s;e days, as in any part of Europe at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians give this rea&s;on, among others, for &s;hut|ting up their women, that their prophet was heard to &s;ay, in his la&s;t moments, whil&s;t dying, <Q>Take care of your religion, and your wives.</Q> And great care they take of them indeed, for their Harams are not inclo&s;ed with a &s;ingle wall, but frequently have two or three, and the&s;e of an extraordinary height, The men are taught al&s;o, as they value their &s;alvation and the glory of God, never to ca&s;t an eye on their neighbour's women, or even the places where they are kept; and if they &s;hould meet the camels that carry them in the &s;treets or on the road, though they are &s;hut up &s;o clo&s;e that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee them, yet the men turn a&s;ide their faces as they pa&s;s by, or go out of the way. And the women are taught, that their honour and virtue does not con&s;i&s;t in pre&s;erving their cha&s;tity only, but in pre|venting
<PB N="42" REF="44">
their being &s;een, or &s;eeing any man but their lord; and they are accordingly prohibited from conver|&s;ing with their brothers or neare&s;t male relations. We are &s;peaking now of the women kept in the Harams of great men, &s;o great a particularity not being always pre&s;erved with other women.</P>
<P>As the Per&s;ians hold, that women were made only for their plea&s;ure, and for the continuance of the &s;pecies, and that there is no manner of occa&s;ion for them in the management of the affairs of the world, as in bu&s;ine&s;s of any kind whatever, they &s;uffer them to pa&s;s their lives in idlene&s;s and luxury. Accordingly we &s;ee them, almo&s;t all the day, lolling on carpets, with their little &s;laves rubbing and chafing them, which is the common amu&s;e|ment in the ea&s;t. Sometimes they take opium, or &s;moke their country tobacco, which is &s;o mild, that it may be taken from morning till night, without di&s;turbing their heads. Their food is dre&s;&s;ed by their &s;laves, and their cloaths al&s;o made and wa&s;hed by them, &s;o that they have nothing to do but to indulge them&s;elves, and plea&s;e their tyrants.</P>
<P>The women of the Haram are attended chiefly by eunuchs, and there are a va&s;t number of them di&s;per&s;ed throughout the whole kingdom of Per&s;ia, e&s;pecially in the king's palaces, and tho&s;e of the quality, where they have almo&s;t every thing of value entru&s;ted to their care; and, in a manner, govern the affairs of their ma&s;ters.
<PB N="43" REF="45">
The women never &s;tir abroad without them, either on a vi&s;it, or even to the bath: but they are not per|mitted to interrupt their privacy in their chambers.</P>
<P>The eunuchs al&s;o teach the children of the family to read and write, and in&s;truct them in the principles of their religion, till it is thought fit to put them into the hands of the learned; and even then they have the care of the young gentlemen, not &s;uffering them to be at any time out of their &s;ight; and as to the king's children, who never &s;tir out of the Haram till they come to the throne, they have no other ma&s;ters. Some few of the&s;e eunuchs, are ver&s;ed in the liberal and mechanic arts; and it is happy where the prince who &s;ucceeds falls into the hands of &s;uch a one; for, otherwi&s;e, he comes to the throne a meer novice.</P>
<P>Eunuchs are generally cut between &s;even and ten years of age; if not done till they are fifteen, not one in four would &s;urvive the operation. An eunuch between eight and &s;ixteen years of age is &s;old, in Per&s;ia, for 100<HI>l.</HI> Engli&s;h money, at lea&s;t, and &s;ometimes for 200<HI>l.</HI> according to their capacities. People chu&s;e to buy them, in order to train them up to their wi&s;hes, which done, they &s;eldom change their ma&s;ters whil&s;t they live. Not having any friends or relations which they know, their &s;ole dependence is on their lord, and they make it their whole bu&s;ine&s;s to plea&s;e him, and generally manage matters &s;o as to obtain the government of the family.
<PB N="44" REF="46">
They are brought from the coa&s;t of Malabar. Few per|&s;ons have any white eunuchs, except the king, who has &s;eldom le&s;s, of one &s;ort or other, than three or four thou&s;and. Men of the fir&s;t rank have u&s;ually half a dozen in their hou&s;es; tho&s;e of inferior quality two or three. As the&s;e unhappy men are not taken up with amorous pur&s;uits, and can have no views to the rai&s;ing of families of their own, they are generally very diligent in their re&s;pective employments, and faithful to their ma&s;ters.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of their Cu&s;toms, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE u&s;ual &s;alute, in this country, is bowing the body a little, and clapping the right hand to the brea&s;t; but men never &s;tir their cap or their turban. Tho&s;e who are more familiar, pre&s;s the palm of your hand, between both theirs, and then rai&s;e them to their forehead, to expre&s;s the high and cordial re&s;pect they have for you. Before the king, the viceroys of provinces, and other great men, they bow their faces three times to the ground, as they approach them. As to Europeans, if they are not clothed in the Per&s;ian dre&s;s, they expect them to take off their hats, and to be treated with the &s;ame marks of
<PB N="45" REF="47">
re&s;pect, as are &s;hewn to men of quality in their own country. The awful manner in which the Per&s;ians treat their &s;uperiors in rank, &s;carce having any voice or opinion whil&s;t in their pre&s;ence, is a &s;pecimen of the genuine growth of arbitrary power, and a de&s;potic in|va&s;ion of the common &s;en&s;e, as well as the common liberty, of mankind.</P>
<P>Upon any occa&s;ion of mourning, or rejoicing, the Per&s;ians never fail to vi&s;it each other; and people of condition always expect the compliments of their de|pendants on &s;uch occa&s;ions. They are introduced into a large hall, where coffee and tobacco is &s;et before them, and with which they refre&s;h them&s;elves, till the great man appears. As &s;oon as they &s;ee him, every man ri&s;es up, and &s;tands in his place. Having bowed to them, as he pa&s;&s;es by, every one bows much, lower to him again; and after he has taken his &s;eat, he makes a &s;ign to the company to &s;it. If the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e be already in his hall, the vi&s;itor comes in &s;oftly, and, &s;tep|ping to the next vacant place, &s;tands gravely with his feet clo&s;e together and his hands acro&s;s, till the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e makes a &s;ign to him to &s;it down. If a per&s;on receives a vi&s;it from a &s;uperior, he acts different from the Engli&s;h cu&s;tom, in placing him on the right hand, it being a mark of re&s;pect, in Per&s;ia, to place a per&s;on on the left hand.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">The Per&s;ians are not much addicted to gaming, in|deed mo&s;t of the &s;crupulous ones, con&s;ider all games of chance to be unlawful; but there are tho&s;e who play at cards, dice, tables, che&s;s, and other games, not in u&s;e among us. The King, and per&s;ons of rank, divert them&s;elves &s;ometimes with the fights of wild bea&s;ts as in India, and the common people are amu&s;ed, at times, with tumblers, rope-dancers, and jugglers, as with us. They have, al&s;o, martial and rural amu&s;ements. The former I will &s;peak of by and by, the latter con&s;i&s;ts in hunting and cour&s;ing.</P>
<P>Their greyhounds are &s;omething like our Iri&s;h grey|hounds, but the &s;tags and antelopes they cour&s;e are &s;o &s;wift of foot, that the dogs cannot come up with them, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of hawks, of which, they have various kinds brought from Circa&s;&s;ia, Mu&s;covy, and the northern parts of the empire. The&s;e hawks are taught not only to fly at partridges, quails, rabbits, hares, &amp;c. but even at deer, and wild bea&s;ts; and to train them up to this, they &s;tuff the &s;kin of the&s;e animals, fa&s;ten a piece of fle&s;h on the head of it, with which they feed the hawk, drawing the &s;tuffed &s;kin along upon wheels, to u&s;e them to fix them&s;elves on the head whil&s;t it moves. When they have u&s;ed the young hawk to this for &s;ome time, they carry him to the &s;port with &s;ome old &s;taunch hawk that is u&s;ed to the game. The dogs being let loo&s;e, the hawks are &s;oon after thrown off, who pur&s;ue the deer, fa&s;tening on its no&s;e, &s;triking their talons into the
<PB N="47" REF="49">
fle&s;h, and keep beating their wings about his head, &s;o that he cannot &s;ee his way, and thus gives the dogs an oppor|tunity to come up with him. The gentlemen u&s;ually carry a little kettle-drum at their &s;addle-bow, to call off their hawks. Some of them, it is &s;aid, have formerly been taught to fly at men. <HI>Chardin</HI> tells us, that the governor of Tauris, whom he was particularly ac|quainted with, u&s;ed to divert him&s;elf with this &s;port, &s;ometimes not &s;paring even his friends; that one day he let his hawks fly at a gentleman, and they tore his face and eyes in that manner, that he died of it, which the King being made acquainted with, re&s;ented it &s;o far, that he turned him out of office.</P>
<P>When the King, or the great <HI>Omrahs</HI> or lords go a hunting, the country people, for ten or fifteen leagues round, are ordered to drive all the wild bea&s;ts, and game, into a certain place &s;urrounded with &s;trong nets or fences, and, when thus inclo&s;ed, every one of the company &s;hoots at which he plea&s;es, and a horrible &s;laughter is made of them. Many hundreds are often killed at one of the&s;e hunting matches, but they u&s;u|ally wait till the men of the greate&s;t rank in the field come up, and di&s;charges an arrow, after which every one &s;hoots as fa&s;t as he can, there being a &s;trange med|ley of deer, antelopes, wild hogs, wolves, foxes, hares, &amp;c. all driven in a crowd together. As for hounds, and hunting by &s;cent, they know nothing of it; indeed their country &s;eems too dry for this kind of &s;port, even had
<PB N="48" REF="50">
they proper dogs. They frequently, however, train up panthers and leopards to hunt the game, or rather to &s;urprize it, for the&s;e animals creep from one cover to another, 'till they can jump upon their prey, as a cat does on a mou&s;e, but never run after it in a continued cour&s;e.</P>
<P>About A&s;trab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, the pea&s;ants &s;upport them&s;elves by catching wild ducks. They go in boats on the Ca&s;pian, during the night near the mar&s;hy banks, which are co|vered with ru&s;hes, and carry great lights on the &s;tern; then ringing a number of &s;mall bells, the birds are confounded, and fly to their very hands.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic &s;eems to be no part of their genius. Both &s;ing|ing and dancing are con&s;idered, in Per&s;ia, as di&s;graceful. People of condition will not &s;uffer their children to learn either the one or the other; but it is left, almo&s;t entirely, as it is all over the ea&s;t, to common wenches and pro&s;titutes. It is reckoned an indecency, in people of any reputation, to &s;ing, and would render a man contemptible, who &s;hould attempt it in company. They call their &s;inging-women <HI>Caine,</HI> intimating that they derive their &s;kill from the daughters of <HI>Cain,</HI> who, they pretend, were the fir&s;t inventors of &s;inging and mu&s;ic in the ea&s;t. They &s;ing and play by rule, though they make but poor har|mony, at lea&s;t &s;uch as is plea&s;ing to an European ear, yet they are much delighted with our mu&s;ic. There is no &s;uch thing as &s;inging in parts, but &s;ing one after another,
<PB N="49" REF="51">
and generally to &s;ome &s;trung in&s;trument, as the lute, or the viol. Their men &s;ing better than the women, but there are not many of them that practi&s;e it, mu&s;ic being prohibited by their religion. Their eccle&s;ia&s;tics and devo|tees will not &s;o much as be pre&s;ent at &s;uch entertain|ments, which is one rea&s;on that the &s;cience is not arrived at a greater perfection there. They have a great num|ber of in&s;truments both of &s;trung and wind mu&s;ic, &s;ome in &s;hape like our hautboys, and flutes, others, like the viol, harp, virginals, kettle-drum, and trumpet. But the &s;trings of their in&s;truments are not made of gut, touching any thing belonging to a dead animal, e&s;pe|cially the entrails, being held a pollution; the &s;trings, therefore, are made of twi&s;ted &s;ilk or bra&s;s-wire.</P>
<P>Their trumpet is the mo&s;t mon&s;trous in&s;trument for &s;ize and &s;ound that can be met with; it is commonly &s;even or eight feet long and proportionably wide at the great end, and as much as a man can hold up. The&s;e, and their drums, in a manner drown all other &s;ounds, and, indeed, their mu&s;ic, as it is called, &s;erves chiefly, in&s;tead of clocks, to let people know the time of day or night, &s;ounding con&s;tantly at certain hours. Bells they have none, and when the King, or any great man, goes out of his palace, notice is always given of it by the &s;ound of drums and trumpets, placed over the palace-gates, or in &s;ome balcony, or gallery; and their noi&s;e is &s;o great, that it may be heard at a va&s;t di&s;tance. In &s;ome places, mu&s;ic and dancing girls make part of a
<PB N="50" REF="52">
great man's equipage, and run before him when he goes abroad; but, in general, the performers are a ragged, &s;trolling rabble, and, except &s;ome of the King's, are &s;carce worth hearing. However, on any fe&s;tival, as the circumci&s;ing of a child, or other joyful occa&s;ion, they come and play before people's doors, and u&s;ually have &s;omething given them for their pains.</P>
<P><HI>Hanway</HI> &s;ays, that the King's &s;ecretary invited him at Amul, (where there is a palace, and which city is &s;aid to have been founded upwards of 4000 years,) to hear his mu&s;ic, of which, one in&s;trument re&s;embled a flute, another a kettle-drum, and a third a guitar, to which an old man and two boys &s;ung and danced. The boys moved their heads, legs, and arms, whil&s;t &s;inging, in a very extravagant manner. A prie&s;t was next &s;ent for, remarkable for being a good &s;inger; and this man, rai&s;ed his voice to a degree of amazement, his quavers were mixed with a very har&s;h guttural &s;ound, and the di&s;tortions of his vi&s;age &s;uch as created rather horror than delight.</P>
<P>I will take the opportunity here, of &s;aying &s;omething of their mode of travelling. There are no wheel-car|riages in this country, but all per&s;ons travel on camels, hor&s;es, mules, or a&s;&s;es. The women, who are to be concealed as much as po&s;&s;ible, are put into a &s;quare wooden machine, a kind of covered chair, called <HI>Ked|gavay,</HI> about three feet deep, and ju&s;t high enough for
<PB N="51" REF="53">
a per&s;on to &s;it down in. Over head are three or four hoops, like tho&s;e which &s;upport the tilt of a waggon, with a cloth thrown over them. The&s;e are hung over the back of a camel like a pair of paniers. Their a&s;&s;es are much larger and &s;wifter of foot than ours, and will trot ten miles at a pretty good rate, but are very ob|&s;tinate and unlucky, and frequently throw their riders. But if travellers have any great di&s;tance to go, they perform their journey with caravans, or <HI>Cafilas,</HI> as they are called in Per&s;ia. A Cafila is compo&s;ed of camels, hor&s;es, and mules, the whole of which are under the direction of a <HI>Cheharwa D&agrave;r,</HI> or ma&s;ter. It is to him the price of a mule or camel is paid, and he &s;tipulates with the traveller to feed and take care of the bea&s;t during the journey. He has, under him, &s;everal inferior &s;ervants, who help to unload the bea&s;ts of burden, water them, and attend them. Whil&s;t on the journeys, the Cafila keeps as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, and, on its arrival at <HI>Munzil Gah,</HI> or place of encampment for the day, each load is depo&s;ited on a particular &s;pot, marked out by the ma&s;ter, to which the merchant who owns the goods repairs. His luggage forms a cre&s;cent; in the centre are placed the bedding and provi&s;ions, a rope, or line made of hair, is then drawn round the whole, at the di&s;tance of about three yards each way, which &s;erves to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;eparate encampments. During the night, the bea&s;ts are all brought to their &s;tations, op|po&s;ite to the goods they are to carry in the morning, and are made fa&s;t to the hair-rope above mentioned.
<PB N="52" REF="54">
At the hour of moving, which is generally between three and four in the morning, they load the mules and camels; and the pa&s;&s;engers are awakened by the jingling of the bells tied round the necks of the bea&s;ts, in order to prevent their &s;traggling during their march. When all things are ready, the ma&s;ter orders tho&s;e neare&s;t the road to advance, and the whole moves off in regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Where there are caravan&s;eras, travellers find their lodging gratis, and can there purcha&s;e pro|vi&s;ions at the be&s;t hand.</P>
<P>Though the roads, in this country, are &s;teep and mountainous, yet &s;uch care is taken in laying bridges and cau&s;eways, and to level and open the ways, that a traveller &s;eldom meets with any difficulties, but what are ea&s;ily &s;urmounted.</P>
<P>Here are no general po&s;ts, but if any per&s;on has letters to &s;end, he di&s;patches a <HI>Shater</HI> or footman expre&s;s, who will travel a thou&s;and miles in 18 or 20 days, and not a&s;k more than 20<HI>d.</HI> or 2<HI>s.</HI> a day Engli&s;h. They carry with them a bottle of water, and a little bag of provi&s;ion, and this &s;erves them for thirty or forty hours. They generally leave the high road, and cro&s;s the country the neare&s;t way. There are families which make this their only employment, and breed their children up to it, practi&s;ing them to run from their infancy.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55">The king, and all the great men, have &s;everal of the&s;e &s;haters, or running-footmen in their retinue; but before a man can be admitted one of the king's footmen, he mu&s;t give &s;ufficient proof that he wants neither heels nor breath, for he mu&s;t run from the great gate of the palace, to a place a league and a half from the city, twelve times in one day, and each time bring an arrow, which is delivered him by tho&s;e who &s;tand at the end of the race, to &s;hew he has run the whole cour&s;e; and this he performs between the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;un, being no le&s;s than a hundred and eight miles. It is always &s;ome favourite &s;ervant of the king's who is ad|mitted to this honour. On the day of trial, the elephants and hor&s;emen are drawn up in the royal &s;quare, with drums and trumpets &s;ounding, as if it were &s;ome fe&s;|tival. The great men give pre&s;ents to the &s;hater, and &s;ome ride the cour&s;e with him, to ingratiate them&s;elves with the prince, and the mob hail him every time he returns with &s;houts and acclamations. The chams and viceroys, who admit of a &s;hater into their &s;ervice, make him run the &s;ame number of miles, and they are care&s;&s;ed and pre&s;ented by all their dependants in the &s;ame manner the king's &s;haters are, though not &s;o largely; for it is u&s;ual for the &s;hater to receive a thou&s;and pounds on &s;uch an occa&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of their Marriages, Births, Funerals, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS the women are never to be &s;een in Per&s;ia, a man is obliged to be contented with &s;uch an account of his mi&s;tre&s;s's beauty and accompli&s;hments as he receives from others. They are allowed four legal wives, with whom they may enter into formal contracts before the civil magi&s;trate (who is al&s;o an eccle&s;ia&s;tic); but they are generally contented with one, and &s;he &s;eems to be taken on political views, on account of the di&s;tinction or intere&s;t of her family, or to &s;erve as a governe&s;s or mi&s;tre&s;s to the re&s;t of the women who wait upon her, and rank only as concubines, notwith&s;tanding they have the honour of their ma&s;ter's bed and their i&s;&s;ue are equally legitimate; for there is no &s;uch thing as a ba&s;tard in Per&s;ia. Tho&s;e born before, and tho&s;e after marriage, have the &s;ame pri|vileges; nor is it any di&s;avantage to a &s;on, in regard to his inheritance, to be born of a concubine, or even of a black &s;lave.</P>
<P>Love is the lea&s;t motive for entering into a contract with a lawful wife, as &s;he is called, e&s;pecially among the great, nor does &s;he expect much of it; but it is the
<PB N="55" REF="57">
number of &s;laves, the cloaths, the equipage, and figure the man makes in the world, which are the great in|ducements for a woman, or her friends, to ally her&s;elf to any family. If the wife is &s;o unfortunate as to be in love with her hu&s;band, &s;he is u&s;ually very unhappy; for &s;he will frequently have the mortification of &s;eeing him leave her bed for that of a &s;lave, and perhaps for a com|mon &s;trumpet, and, in return for her pa&s;&s;ion, may po&s;&s;i|bly be pre&s;ented with the venereal di&s;ea&s;e; and if &s;he &s;hews any re&s;entment, will probably &s;ee another wife introduced into the hou&s;e, to govern in her &s;tead. For if a man &s;hould be di&s;contented with his wife, after mar|riage, (which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e here as in other countries,) he is at liberty to divorce her; a man be|ing always, by the mahomedan law, enabled to put away his wife at di&s;cretion. This is performed by giving her every thing he had previous to the marriage, (which after her death goes to her children, if &s;he has any,) and by re-demanding the contract of his wife's relations. The ceremony of divorce is called by the Per&s;ians <HI>Tela&agrave;k.</HI> If again, after the divorce, the hu&s;band &s;hould be in|clined to take his wife back, he is at liberty &s;o to do, and this for three times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and when it &s;o hap|pens, the contract mu&s;t be renewed each time; but, after the third time, he is expre&s;sly forbidden to re-marry the &s;ame woman; but it &s;eldom happens that a man who is divorced from his wife, is inclined to take her back again; tho&s;e who do &s;o, being in little e&s;timation with their neighbours: and with re&s;pect to the number of
<PB N="56" REF="58">
wives a man has, that per&s;on is mo&s;t e&s;teemed who at|taches him&s;elf to one.</P>
<P>Contracts of marriage in Per&s;ia, as well as in many other places in the ea&s;t, are often made between families at a very early period; and although con&s;ummation does not take place till many years after, yet the woman contracted cannot divorce her&s;elf, or be ab&s;olved from the contract, unle&s;s with the con&s;ent of her betrothed hu&s;band, except on forfeiture of a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, the &s;ame al&s;o binding on the part of the man.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual &s;ugge&s;tions for a woman to obtain a di|vorce are, that her hu&s;band is impotent, or &s;pends too much of his time with his female &s;laves and concubines, and does not pay her attention &s;ufficient; in either of which ca&s;es the magi&s;trate will grant a divorce, and both parties are at liberty to marry el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>A widow is obliged to wait four months after the death of her hu&s;band, before &s;he is permitted by law to marry again; but the concubine of a per&s;on decea&s;ed, may go to another as &s;oon as &s;he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>When the parents of a young man have determined upon marrying him, they look out among&s;t their kindred and acquaintances for a &s;uitable match; having &s;uc|ceeded, the young man's father, mother, or &s;i&s;ter, a&s;|&s;emble a company of their friends, and go to the young
<PB N="57" REF="59">
woman's hou&s;e, and propo&s;e the match. If her father approves the propo&s;als, as a token of compliance, he orders &s;weet-meats to be brought in, and the company at that time take their leave. Some days after, the fe|males of the man's family a&s;&s;emble at the hou&s;e of the intended bride, when the terms of marriage are &s;ettled, and the cu&s;tomary pre&s;ents on the part of the bride|groom promi&s;ed. The&s;e, if the per&s;on be in middling circum&s;tances, generally con&s;i&s;t of two complete &s;uits of apparel of the be&s;t kind, a ring, a looking-gla&s;s a &s;mall &s;um of money, about ten or twelve tomans, which &s;um is called <HI>Mehr a Kaw&egrave;&egrave;n,</HI> or the marriage-portion, it being given for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of providing for the wife, in ca&s;e of a divorce. There is al&s;o provided a quantity of hou&s;ehold furniture of all &s;orts, as carpets, matts, bedding, kitchen-uten&s;ils, &amp;c. After this, a writing or contract is drawn up, in the pre&s;ence of and witne&s;&s;ed by, the <HI>cadi</HI> or magi&s;trate, or, in his ab&s;ence, by an <HI>akhund</HI> or prie&s;t, which is &s;igned and &s;ealed, and depo&s;ited in the hands of the bride's father. This ce|remony being fini&s;hed, the marriage, by the mahomedan law, is deemed perfect. But, prior to the contract, the per&s;on of the man is examined by the parents or friends of the woman, and that of the woman by the mother or other relations of the man. Nothing now remains, but to celebrate the wedding, which generally takes place the &s;e|cond or third day after &s;igning the contract. The night before the wedding, the friends and relations of the bride a&s;&s;emble at her hou&s;e, attended by mu&s;ic, dancing girls,
<PB N="58" REF="60">
and other &s;igns of fe&s;tivity. This night is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of <HI>Sheb Hinna Bundee,</HI> or the night on which the hands and feet of the bride are &s;tained with the herb of hinna, well known all over the Ea&s;t. Previous to the ceremony, a large quantity of this herb is &s;ent by the bridegroom to the hou&s;e of the bride, and, on the day of &s;taining, &s;he is fir&s;t conveyed to the bath, where, having bathed, &s;he is brought back to her own hou&s;e, and her hands and feet are &s;tained with hinna, and her eye-brows and forehead painted with the antimony powder called <HI>Surma.</HI> This being fini&s;hed, the remains of the herb are &s;ent back to the bridegroom, where the like operation is performed upon him by her friends. The wedding night being come, the friends of both parties, men and women, a&s;&s;emble at the hou&s;e of the bride in order to convey her to her hu&s;band. They are attended with all &s;orts of mu&s;ic, &s;ingers, and dancing girls, and all are dre&s;&s;ed in their &s;marte&s;t apparel, each of the women having on a veil of red &s;ilk. The pre&s;ents which the bridegroom has made are all put into trays' co|vered with red &s;ilk, and carried on men's &s;houlders. After waiting at the door for &s;ome time, the bride is brought forth, covered from head to foot in a veil of red &s;ilk or painted mu&s;lin; a hor&s;e is then pre&s;ented for her to mount, &s;ent by the bridegroom; and, when mounted, a large looking-gla&s;s, is held before her by one of the bridemaids all the way to the hou&s;e of her hu&s;band, as an admonition, that it is the la&s;t time &s;he will look into a gla&s;s as a virgin, being now about to enter into
<PB N="59" REF="61">
the cares of the married &s;tate. The proce&s;&s;ion then &s;ets forward in the following order: Fir&s;t, the mu&s;ic and dancing girls; next, the pre&s;ents on men's &s;houlders; then follow the relations and friends of the bridegroom, all &s;houting and making a great noi&s;e; next to the&s;e comes the bride, &s;urrounded by all her female friends and relations, one of whom leads the hor&s;e by the bridle. Being arrived at the hou&s;e of her hu&s;band, they are met at the door by his father and mother, and from thence conducted up &s;tairs. The bride then enters the room, and the bridegroom, who is at the upper end, makes a low obei&s;ance and then advances, takes her in his arms and embraces her; &s;oon after they retire to a private chamber, and, on their return to the company, it cau&s;es great rejoicing. All then &s;it down to &s;upper in &s;eparate apartments, the men eating with the bridegroom in one room, and the women with the bride in another. The &s;upper is prolonged to a late hour in the night, with cheerfulne&s;s and fe&s;tive mirth; and the rejoicings continue eight or ten days.</P>
<P>The Armenians, who were originally of the Greek church, though now differing a little from it, are &s;ub|jects of Per&s;ia, marry their children u&s;ually in their in|fancy, to prevent their being carried into the harams of the great men; for either the Per&s;ians are &s;o ju&s;t, as not to take any man's wife from him, or too nice to take women who have been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another. But, though the parties are frequently contracted at four or five years of age, the marriage is &s;eldom cele|brated
<PB N="60" REF="62">
till they are eight or ten, and the bridegroom every year at Ea&s;ter &s;ends the bride a fine ve&s;t &s;uitable to her rank; that is, the parents tran&s;act all the&s;e matters among them&s;elves, the con&s;ent of the young people being a&s;ked only for form &s;ake when they are brought to church.</P>
<P>On the day of marriage, the bridegroom being richly dre&s;&s;ed, mounts his hor&s;e, and, attended by his neare&s;t relations, comes to the hou&s;e of the bride's father, when &s;he al&s;o gets on hor&s;eback, being dre&s;&s;ed in the fine&s;t &s;ilks, but covered with a veil, and accompanied by her friends and relations, with lighted torches in their hands, proceeds to the church. Being alighted from their hor&s;es, the bride and bridegroom go up to the altar, where, &s;tanding pretty clo&s;e together, face to face, the bi&s;hop re&s;ting his book upon their heads, reads the &s;ervice, and, having received their con&s;ent, gives them his ble&s;&s;ing, whereupon the drums and trumpets &s;ound, the mu&s;ic plays, and they return to the bridegroom's hou&s;e in the &s;ame order as they came, unle&s;s they hear ma&s;s, and receive the &s;acrament, as they frequently do on the&s;e occa&s;ions; for then the bride is carried back to her father's hou&s;e, and the wedding is not con&s;ummated till &s;ome days after. The gue&s;ts are &s;plendidly enter|tained on the&s;e occa&s;ions as in other countries, only that the men and women eat and drink in &s;eparate rooms. In the evening, the bride and bridegroom are conducted to the nuptial chamber, and the company retire after a
<PB N="61" REF="63">
profu&s;ion of ro&s;e-water being thrown about, and a thou&s;and wi&s;hes for the happine&s;s of the new-married couple.</P>
<P>Some days after the wedding, the bridal portion is &s;ent to the hu&s;band's hou&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of fine cloaths, gold, &s;ilver, and jewels, according to the rank of the parties; &s;ome choice fruits and &s;weet-meats are u&s;ually added, all carried in fine boxes and cabinets, attended by &s;uch mu&s;ic as the country affords.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another people in Per&s;ia, who go under the name of chri&s;tians, but who&s;e religion &s;eems to be compo&s;ed of chri&s;tianity, judai&s;m, and mahomedani&s;m. They are called chri&s;tians of St. John, and inhabit near the gulph of Per&s;ia, in the province of Chu&s;i&s;tan, where it is computed there are not le&s;s than 20,000 families of them. Their marriages, if travellers do not impo&s;e upon us, have &s;omething very particular in them; but as all who &s;peak of this people agree in their accounts, I will venture to give the relation as I find it. It &s;eems, the prie&s;ts and relations of the bridegroom go, in the fir&s;t place, and demand of the bride whether &s;he be a virgin. If &s;he an&s;wers Yes, they make her &s;wear to it; and not contented with this, &s;he undergoes an examination by the prie&s;t's wife. Afterwards the bride and bridegroom are brought to a river, where the prie&s;t baptizes them; then the bridegroom leads the bride home to his hou&s;e, where, being &s;eated clo&s;e together, the prie&s;t reads a long
<PB N="62" REF="64">
&s;ervice upon the occa&s;ion. He next takes a book of divination, and ca&s;ts lots to di&s;cover the happy hour for con&s;ummation. The bridegroom having bedded his &s;pou&s;e, goes with her to the bi&s;hop, acknowledges that he is &s;atisfied of his wife's virtue, and the bi&s;hop, in con|&s;equence, performs the remainder of the marriage cere|mony, putting rings on their fingers, and baptizing them again. But if the hu&s;band will not vouch for the honour and virtue of his wife, the bi&s;hop will have no concern in the celebration of the marriage, but leaves it to an inferior prie&s;t, and the woman lo&s;es her repu|tation.</P>
<P>At the naming of children, among the Per&s;ians, the following ceremony is ob&s;erved. The third birth-day after the child is born, the friends of the lying-in woman a&s;&s;emble at her hou&s;e, attended by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and dancing girls hired for the occa&s;ion. After playing and dancing &s;ome time a mullah or prie&s;t is introduced, who, taking the child in his arms, demands of the mother what name &s;he chu&s;es the infant &s;hould be called by: being told, he begins praying; and, after a &s;hort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pers in the child's ears, telling it di&s;tinctly three times, and calling it by its name, to remember and be obedient to its father and mother, to venerate the Koran and the prophet, to ab&s;tain from tho&s;e things that are unlawful, and practi&s;e tho&s;e things which are good and virtuous. Having repeated the mahomedan profe&s;&s;ion of faith, he re-delivers the child to its mother: after which the
<PB N="63" REF="65">
company are entertained with &s;weet-meats and refre&s;h|ments, a part of which the females carry away with them in their pockets, firmly believing it will be the means of their having children them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The ceremony of the <HI>Sunnut,</HI> or circumci&s;ion, is ge|nerally performed within 40 days from the birth of the child, as being the &s;afe&s;t time; but it is unlawful if not performed before the boy is fourteen years old. The operation is performed by a barber with a razor, there being no &s;urgeons in Per&s;ia, after the Jewi&s;h ritual, and in the manner practi&s;ed by the mu&s;&s;ulmen in India; and at &s;uch times the parents of the child invite their friends to an entertainment, Sir <HI>John Chardin</HI> &s;ays, that in &s;ome parts of Per&s;ia they circumci&s;e old women. With great men this ceremony is uncommonly &s;plendid. Mr. <HI>Franklin</HI> tells us, he was an eye-witne&s;s of the rejoicings made by the inhabitants of Shirauz, in honour of the King of Per&s;ia's &s;on, who was circumci&s;ed on the 27th of April, 1787.</P>
<P>On the 20th, great preparations having previou&s;ly been made, the bazars, or covered market-places, were &s;plendidly illuminated, particularly the grand ba|zar, which was adorned throughout with lu&s;tres of party-coloured lamps, &s;u&s;pended from the roof about half way down. The &s;hops of the merchants, on each &s;ide, were dre&s;&s;ed out in great finery, with &s;ilver paper, rich hangings, &amp;c. the walls on each &s;ide, to a con&s;i|derable
<PB N="64" REF="66">
height covered with tape&s;try, looking-gla&s;&s;es and many paintings, done in the Per&s;ian &s;tyle, mo&s;t of them repre&s;enting the ancient kings of Per&s;ia and India, in the different dre&s;&s;es of their re&s;pective countries, as well as de&s;igns taken from their admired poets. Bands of mu&s;ic and dancing women, were con&s;tantly perform|ing night and day, throughout the different bazars, on &s;caffoldings erected for that purpo&s;e; and the whole was a &s;cene of fe&s;tivity for &s;even days and as many nights. Among &s;everal ingenious things ob&s;ervable on this oc|ca&s;ion, the &s;ight pre&s;ented at the ar&s;enal was mo&s;t wor|thy of notice. In the center of this building, the ar|mourers had &s;u&s;pended in the air a bra&s;s-mortar of 800<HI>lb.</HI> by &s;ome hidden means, as nothing appeared to &s;upport it either above or below, the only vi&s;ible thing being a number of coloured bottles &s;ticking to it, as if to keep it buoyant in the atmo&s;phere. I was told, how|ever, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> that it was effected by means of a wire pa&s;&s;ed from the roof of the place to the mouth of the mortar, but not being vi&s;ible to the &s;pectators, it gave it a very ingenious effect. The decorations on this occa&s;ion co&s;t the &s;hop-keepers and trade&s;men con&s;i|derable &s;ums; as, be&s;ides the illumination, they were obliged to make a hand&s;ome <HI>pie&s;hcu&s;h,</HI> or pre&s;ent, to the King and his &s;on, who al&s;o, on this occa&s;ion, gave a grand entertainment in the citadel, to which the princi|ple men in the city were invited; and the whole was con|cluded by a magnificent di&s;play of fire-works.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67">The funerals of the Per&s;ians are conducted in a &s;imilar manner to tho&s;e in other mahomedan countries. On the death of a mu&s;&s;ulman, the relations and friends of the decea&s;ed, being a&s;&s;embled, make loud lamentations over the corp&s;e. They are generally interred the evening of the day on which they die. They are always wa&s;hed before they are buried. For this purpo&s;e there are re|&s;ervoirs; but the poorer &s;ort are commonly taken to the neare&s;t pond. Being wa&s;hed, the body is wound up in a cotton cloth, on which are &s;tamped &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of the Koran, and it is thus carried to a place of interment, attended by &s;ome of the relations of the decea&s;ed, and a prie&s;t, &s;inging &s;ome parts of the Koran, all the way to the grave. Should any mu&s;&s;ulman chance to meet the corp&s;e during the proce&s;&s;ion, he is obliged, by the precepts of his religion, to run up to the bier, and offer his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to carry it, crying out, at the &s;ame time, <HI>L&agrave;h illah ill L&igrave;llah!</HI> that is, "there is no God but God." After the interment, the relations of the decea&s;ed return home, and the women of the family make a mixture of wheat, honey, and &s;pices, which they eat in memory of the decea&s;ed, &s;ending a part of it to their friends and acquaintance, that they al&s;o may pay him a like honour. This cu&s;tom &s;eems to be derived from very great anti|quity; for we read in <HI>Homer,</HI> of &s;acrifices and libations being frequently made to the memory of departed &s;ouls.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of their Trade and Manufactures.</HEAD>
<P>MANUFACTURES and trade are, at pre&s;ent, greatly decayed in Per&s;ia, owing to the long civil wars; but, as the Per&s;ians are very ingenious, indu&s;trious, and of quick capacities, there is little doubt, but if a regular and permanent government was once again to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, they would flouri&s;h as other nations do. They work in fillagree and ivory remarkably well, and are good turners. At Shirauz, they have a gla&s;s manu|factory, where they ca&s;t great quantities, and convey it to all parts of Per&s;ia. They have neither iron, bra&s;s, nor pewter, in their kitchen-furniture; mo&s;t of their uten&s;ils, being copper, tinned, and their braziers and tin-men are good workmen.</P>
<P>Kom is remarkable for excellent &s;word-blades, and their armourers dama&s;k them, as well as any European. Their fire-arms are but ill contrived; and the locks are made by Europeans, the Per&s;ians not having in|genuity &s;ufficient to make the&s;e, any more than clocks, and watches, which they purcha&s;e from other countries; but all &s;orts of cutlery goods, they are expert in. The
<PB N="67" REF="69">
art of making looking-gla&s;&s;es they do not under&s;tand, but u&s;e little convex &s;teel mirrors, which, owing to the dryne&s;s of the air, &s;eldom ru&s;t or grow dull. As the u&s;e of the bow, is what they value them&s;elves much upon, no country produces better. They are made of wood and horn, bound round with &s;inews, and painted as fine as po&s;&s;ible. The bow&s;tring is made of twi&s;ted &s;ilk, the &s;ize of a goo&s;e-quill, and their quivers are leather, worked with &s;ilk or embroidered.</P>
<P>Embroidery they excel in, both in gold and &s;ilver, either on cloth, &s;ilk, or leather; they almo&s;t cover their &s;addles and hou&s;ings with it; and their &s;titching of leather is beyond any thing we can do. They ride with their &s;tirrups &s;hort, and where we u&s;e bra&s;&s;es about the trap|pings of our hor&s;es, their men of rank have gold.</P>
<P>Silks are the principal manufacture of the country, wrought and unwrought; the wrought are taffeties, tab|bies, &s;atins and &s;ilk mixed with cotton, or camels and goats hair; brocades, and gold ti&s;&s;ue. Of brocades they have a hundred &s;orts, &s;ome of them the riche&s;t any where met with; and the gold velvet here wrought is admirable. All their rich &s;tuffs are very durable. The gold and &s;ilver does not wear off or tarni&s;h whil&s;t the &s;tuff la&s;ts, but keeps its colour and brightne&s;s. The fine&s;t looms for the&s;e &s;tuffs are at I&s;pahan, Ca&s;han, and Ye&s;d. The Turkey carpets which we have in England,
<PB N="68" REF="70">
and the Turkey leather are both made in Per&s;ia, but called Turkey, becau&s;e they are brought to us through that country. Shagreen comes al&s;o from Per&s;ia, which, <HI>Chardin</HI> &s;ays, is made of the &s;kin of an a&s;s's rump. Camel|hair &s;tuffs are made in Carmenia. The&s;e are as &s;oft and &s;mooth, and almo&s;t as fine as tho&s;e made of beaver wool, but are not very &s;trong. There is &s;ome calicoe here, which they figure and dye, but they are not equal to the India callicoes.</P>
<P>Earthen-ware is another manufacture in which the Per&s;ians excel, much beyond the Dutch. Some &s;ay it is equal to China. Their gold wire-drawers and thread-twi&s;ters are capital in their way. <HI>Chardin</HI> &s;ays, they will draw a dram weight of gold into a wire 300 yards long. Their dying is preferable to any thing of the kind in Europe; but this is not &s;o much a&s;cribed to the arti&s;t as the air; which being, as I have ob&s;erved, un|commonly dry and clear, gives a brightne&s;s to the colours and fixes them.</P>
<P>Per&s;ian taylors work very neatly; and as the men's cloaths are made of the riche&s;t flowered and brocaded &s;ilks, which they make to fit &s;o very exact as to do them great credit their &s;ewing is incomparably beyond any thing we can boa&s;t of. They work flowers al&s;o upon their carpets, cu&s;hions, and window-curtains &s;o well, that they &s;eem as if painted. With the taylors, we mu&s;t not forget to mention their barbers, who are no le&s;s ex|cellent
<PB N="69" REF="71">
in their way, for they will &s;have the head almo&s;t at half-a-dozen &s;trokes, and have &s;o light a hand, that you &s;carce feel them. They u&s;e only cold water and hold no ba&s;on under the chin; but have their water in a cup like a tea-cup. After they &s;haved a man, they cut the nails of his feet and hands with a little iron in|&s;trument like a bodkin, &s;harp at the end; which done they rub and chafe his fle&s;h and &s;tretch his arms, a re|fre&s;hment which is as agreeable to Europeans as the na|tives in this hot country.</P>
<P>The gold&s;miths in Per&s;ia are bunglers, they do be&s;t in filligree work; they al&s;o make &s;tone-rings, and en|grave tolerably. Watches and clock-work they are to|tally ignorant of, or any thing which requires &s;prings.</P>
<P>Paper is made of rags, &s;ilk and cotton; is very thin, &s;mooth, and will bear but on one &s;ide. It is not &s;o white as ours, nor in any re&s;pect comparable to it. Their ink is made of galls, vitriol, the rind of the pomegranate, with burnt rice powdered, which being made into a cake, is di&s;&s;olved in gum. In&s;tead of quills they u&s;e a reed, &s;omewhat larger than a quill; their characters are Arabic. The mahomedans con&s;ider paper as &s;acred, think it wrong in any one to burn or tear it, or put it to any improper u&s;e: for &s;ay they, the name of God may be written on it, and it would be impious to prophane it; if it be not written on, it is de&s;igned, they &s;ay, for writing matters on, which concern religion, the laws
<PB N="70" REF="72">
either divine and human, and other venerable purpo&s;es, and ought not to be put to common u&s;e.&mdash;They have not the art of printing, all their books are manu|&s;cript; and writing is con&s;idered as a liberal art. In their rings they wear agates, which &s;erve for &s;eals, and on which is often engraved a ver&s;e from the Koran.</P>
<P>Trade, in Per&s;ia, is generally carried on by brokers and &s;tock-jobbers, who are a very cunning, &s;ubtle gene|neration. After they have agreed at the &s;eller's hou&s;e, they a&s;certain the price, with their fingers, putting their hands under a cloth. The end of the finger &s;tands for one, the bent finger for five, and the &s;trait for ten, the hand open for a hundred; and, if &s;hut, a thou&s;and: during this reckoning, they carry &s;o &s;teady a counte|nance as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for a &s;tranger to gather any thing from it. The mahomedans, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the governing part of the country, are not the great|e&s;t foreign traders. The Armenians engage the Euro|pean trade; for the religion of the mahomedan Per&s;ians forbids them to touch the food, or even the per&s;ons, of tho&s;e whom they look upon to be polluted. Govern|ment find them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity to protect and encourage their chri&s;tian &s;ubjects; for they value their foreign trade, and the revenue attendant on it; of cour&s;e, &s;uffer them to live happy and ea&s;y. Towards Georgia are many chri&s;tians; and the great towns of Julpha and I&s;pahan are inhabited altogether by chri&s;|tians. But of all nations, the Ru&s;&s;ians are mo&s;t advan|tageou&s;ly
<PB N="71" REF="73">
&s;ituated to trade with Per&s;ia, the inte&s;tine broils of that country have often contributed to its advantage; for, be&s;ides cloth and other European goods, the Ru&s;|&s;ians export red leather, furs, &amp;c. and receive, in return, raw-&s;ilk. Hence aro&s;e their jealou&s;y of the Briti&s;h traders; for the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants, particularly tho&s;e of Mo&s;cow, and the trading towns on the Wolga, no &s;ooner ob|&s;erved that the Per&s;ian markets were glutted with European goods, by the Ru&s;&s;ian company of England, than they began to murmur, re&s;olving to make remon|&s;trances to the Court on the &s;ubject. The Armenians ex|tended their trade to the north of Per&s;ia, far beyond the Ru&s;&s;ians, for, by means of their credit in Holland, joined to their own capitals, they employed in commerce about 100,000<HI>l.</HI> This &s;tock was even in&s;ufficient to &s;up|port them; for the exce&s;&s;ive glut of the market in Ghilan, and the terrible oppre&s;&s;ion of the Per&s;ian go|vernment, &s;topped the circulation of their trade, and con&s;equently &s;unk their credit in Holland. At length, they were all con&s;trained to abandon Per&s;ia, and, in 1745, they retired to A&s;trachan, to wait with their effects, till there &s;hould be a fair opportunity of re|turning thither. Whil&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ia company were in &s;ecurity, they could not be in&s;en&s;ible of the benefits of buying raw-&s;ilk of the pea&s;ants of Ghilan, but ad|vantages may be over-rated, and cea&s;e to be &s;uch, when attended with vexations and inconvenience, like tho&s;e which the Ca&s;pian traders experienced.&mdash;It was not, however, the le&s;s ungrateful to ob&s;erve the
<PB N="72" REF="74">
Armenians, a people in them&s;elves de&s;picable, and of no con&s;equence to Ru&s;&s;ia, in competition with the Briti&s;h nation, &s;upported and protected in this trade, when mea&s;ures were &s;o apparently taken to wre&s;t it from the Engli&s;h.&mdash;The Ru&s;&s;ians do indeed alledge, that many of the&s;e Armenians are &s;ubjects of their country, and it is true in general, that &s;uch of them as are engaged in the Ca&s;pian trade do put them&s;elves under the protection of that empire. The&s;e people are educated in all the &s;er|vilities of A&s;ia; and under&s;tanding how to accommodate them&s;elves to indignities, which the genius of a free nation will hardly &s;ubmit to, are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the better qualified to carry on a commerce through foreign dominions. The commencement of our traffic with Per&s;ia happened in 1561, in the third year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and factories were fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed at Shirvan. In 1567, the Turks conquered the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of the Ca&s;pian Sea, and in great mea&s;ure prevent|ed the advancement of that commerce, which the mer|chants naturally flattered them&s;elves would happen, in con&s;equence of a favourable decree, obtained from Ab|dallah Khan, then King of Shirvan and Hyrcania, which la&s;t is now called Ghilan. Several Engli&s;h mer|chants were employed in this traffic, of whom, one Thomas Alcocke was murdered in Per&s;ia. Afterwards, Chri&s;topher Burrough went into Per&s;ia in 1579, and returned home in 1581. He built a ve&s;&s;el on the Wol|ga, at Niezaro-Vogorode in which he tran&s;ported &s;e|veral kinds of merchandi&s;e as far as Baku. At Nie|zabad
<PB N="73" REF="75">
his ve&s;&s;el was &s;tranded, and great part of his cargo lo&s;t. At Derbend, he &s;old a part of his goods, to the Turks, and bought another ve&s;&s;el to bring home his returns of raw &s;ilk; but either through want of experience, or con&s;trained by nece&s;&s;ity, he came to Ru&s;&s;ia, &s;o late as the month of November, which occa&s;ioned his &s;hip to be cut to pieces by the ice; the cargo, however, was &s;aved in a boat, which floating out to &s;ea, with the ice, and being in great danger of peri&s;hing, was, at length, frozen up; the crew left their boat, and the cargo, and went in &s;earch of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but lo&s;ing their way, their lives were much endangered by hunger, as well as by a &s;hower of arrows, from a flying party of Najai Tartars. At la&s;t, they had the good fortune, to bring their car|go &s;afe to A&s;trachan, and thus ended the Briti&s;h, Ca&s;|pian commerce.</P>
<P>Occa&s;ional voyages have &s;ince been made by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, under the Ru&s;&s;ian protection, in the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, but not with any view of e&s;tabli&s;hing trade.&mdash;I &s;hall fini&s;h this &s;hort view of the trade of Per&s;ia, by giving a general idea, of the different kinds of European goods, which the Ru&s;&s;ians and Armenians now &s;end into the northern provinces of that kingdom. The chief demand, next to Dutch cloth, is for Briti&s;h woollens, Gloce&s;ter and ordinary York&s;hire cloths; like|wi&s;e, indigo, cochineal, and, in good times, rick &s;ilks,
<PB N="74" REF="76">
gold and &s;ilver lace, velvets and other rich manufac|tures.</P>
<P>With regard to the quantity of goods imported by the Per&s;ians over the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, whil&s;t the port of Gombroon, was open to the &s;everal nations of Eu|rope; the Ca&s;pian traders, could but ill form an idea, of the general con&s;umption in that kingdom. The Ru&s;&s;ian company, was the mere &s;anguine in it's expectations, from a knowledge, that in the begin|ning of this century, the factors of the Ea&s;t-India company, had extended their trade as far as Tauris on the We&s;tern-coa&s;t of the Ca&s;pian, where they &s;old great quantities of the woollen manufactures of Great-Britain; but when the Briti&s;h factors of Ghilan, who&s;e &s;ituation was now &s;o much more advantageous, would have made an experiment of the like nature, they di&s;covered that city, and it's confines, in &s;o ruinous a &s;tate, as bla&s;ted their hopes of doing any bu&s;ine&s;s in tho&s;e quarters.</P>
<P>When Per&s;ia enjoyed repo&s;e, the agent of the Ea&s;t-India company of England lived in &s;plendor, the re|gal government being held in great veneration, in that empire; he acted, as immediately under the crown of England; and from thence derived an in|fluence, which he could not otherwi&s;e have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; his pompous manner of living, had &s;ome good effects, but the expence was too con&s;iderable, to be long grate|ful to the company.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">The advantages which the Ea&s;t-India company of England, enjoyed beyond the Ru&s;&s;ia company, were &s;uch, as will hardly admit of a compari&s;on, nor in|deed, is it material to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. I &s;hall pa&s;s over in &s;ilence, the trade of Great-Britain, to the gulph of Per&s;ia, as al&s;o that between Per&s;ia and India; ob&s;erving only, that after the Portugue&s;e had &s;ettled them&s;elves in the Ea&s;t-Indies, they took the i&s;land of Ormu, and, being ma&s;ters of the &s;ea, carried on the trade between tho&s;e countries.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XLVIII.</HI> Of their Army and Navy.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tanding forces of Per&s;ia, were never fixed at any determinate number, but were computed in the reign of <HI>Nadir,</HI> at 200,000 men, be&s;ides attendants; the pay given to &s;oldiers, was about 100 crowns, a year, one with another, be&s;ides the allowance, which chiefly con|&s;i&s;ted of rice; but the dearne&s;s of provi&s;ion, and the
<PB N="76" REF="78">
expen&s;ive manner of living in camp, rendered this large pay, ab&s;olutely necee&s;&s;ary. It has been ob&s;erved that &s;oldiers generally fight be&s;t, when they have &s;ome|thing to lo&s;e, if their wealth does not involve them in effeminacy. <HI>Alexander</HI> encouraged the Macedonians, by repre&s;enting the Per&s;ian riches, as an object of plunder, and con&s;equently as a motive to exert them|&s;elves; but under <HI>Nadir,</HI> we do not find that any of their enemies, con&s;idered the valuable effects of the Per&s;ian &s;oldiery in that light. This method &s;erved al&s;o, to keep them dependant, by their being obliged to &s;pend their money in articles of vanity. The late king of Portugal, <HI>John</HI> I. humbled his nobility by in|dulging their pride; and, other Chri&s;tian princes have done the &s;ame by their &s;ubjects, with great &s;ucce&s;s. The riches of a Shah's camp, con&s;i&s;t in hor&s;e-furniture, <HI>Nadir</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Hanway,</HI>) had four complete &s;ets, one mounted with pearls, another with rubies, a third with emeralds, and the la&s;t with diamonds, mo&s;t of which were of &s;o prodigious a &s;ize, as hardly to merit be|lief, for many of them appeared as large as a pid|geon's egg. <HI>Franklin</HI> &s;peaks, of a famous jewel, of <HI>Nadir Shah</HI>'s, called <HI>Dereau Nour,</HI> which has been carried out of Per&s;ia, by &s;ome Armenian merchants, and &s;old to the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, for eighty thou|&s;and pounds. Beautiful as their diamonds are, their lu&s;tre is greatly lo&s;t, by the barbarous manner in which they are &s;et. Some of them are bored through, after
<PB N="77" REF="79">
the manner of the A&s;iatics, who often &s;poil their pre|cious &s;tones by this method.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ual with the Per&s;ian kings, to encourage the army, in the u&s;e of co&s;tly furniture. The officers and even &s;oldiers of rank, have the bridles of their hor&s;es mounted with &s;ilver, with a mane-piece of plate and an ornamental chain; likewi&s;e their &s;word, belts, and other accoutrements, are mounted with the &s;ame metal. The handles of their battle-axes, are &s;tudded, or covered with thin &s;ilver-plates, and in their &s;a&s;hes about their wai&s;t, they wear a knife, the handle and ca&s;e of which, is covered with &s;ilver, but the work|man&s;hip is bad. Officers and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, are obliged to wear gold-ca&s;ed knives, and &s;ome of the great men, have &s;ilver &s;tirrups. <HI>Nadir</HI> particularly encouraged expen&s;ive ornaments among the &s;oldiers, he had the policy to oblige &s;ome by pre&s;ents, which led to a general vanity throughout his army, for all were de&s;irous of co&s;tly trappings, and readily expen|ed their money, to gain the good opinion of their commander.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ian troops not being incumbered with bag|bage, or artillery, make prodigious &s;wift marches, and fall upon the enemy in their camp, with incredible fury, when they lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect &s;uch a vi&s;it. At other times, they will cut off their provi&s;ions, and turn

When an enemy makes head again&s;t them, they will fly, till they have got an advantageous ground, and then return, and charge again. Like the Parthians, they &s;hoot more arrows in their retreat, than when they advance. They never throw intrenchments round their camps, but chu&s;e a mountain or difficult pa&s;s, for that purpo&s;e; but in &s;ieges they intrench, and u&s;ually take a place by under|mining it; and it is thought no people, under&s;tand mining or &s;ubterraneous works better than the Per&s;ians.</P>
<P>In their camps, a general regularity is ob&s;erved, as far as is agreeable to the &s;ize and &s;hape of the ground; it being a rule con&s;tantly pur&s;ued, to place the tents of certain principal mini&s;ters, and officers in the front, or to the right or left of the Shah's quar|ters, that &s;ome of them may be always near him. The circuit of the quarter allotted to the Shah's own tents is very large; the entrance con&s;i&s;ts, on one &s;ide, of a line of uniform tents, &s;erving for guard-rooms; and on the other, of the tents, in which the affairs of chancery, and the like public concerns, are tran&s;acted. About 200 yards beyond this avenue, is the pavillion, in which the Shan u&s;ually &s;its to give audience, and tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s: it is generally oblong, &s;upported by three poles with gilded balls at the top, the cover|ing
<PB N="79" REF="81">
of a cotton cloth, of a brick-colour, and the lining of clouded &s;ilk; the floor covered either with car|pet or cloths, and the body of the pavillion, having on each &s;ide a kind of alley, through which the at|tendants walk round. Sometimes the Shah &s;its upon a large &s;opha or chair, cro&s;s-legg'd, and &s;ometimes on the floor. The hind-part of his tent, is divided into &s;mall apartments, where the officers, who do not appear in his Maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence, attend. There is nothing &s;umptuous in this pavilion, the front of which is always open, even in the wor&s;t of weather; when it is extremely cold, &s;everal pots of lighted charcoal, are placed in the middle. At a con&s;iderable di&s;tance be|hind, are placed the. Shah's private tents, to &s;ome of which he retires at his meals; and in order to ren|der them warm, there are Indian pannels, which are occa&s;ionally &s;et up; but to the&s;e he only admitts his &s;ecret emi&s;&s;aries, when they have any remarkable in|telligence to communicate. Contiguous to the&s;e, are the tents of the Shah's ladies, which differ from the others, in having &s;everal curtains, that form &s;eparate apartments, one without another. The boundaries of the Shah's quarters, are, generally, occupied by his eunuchs, and female &s;laves, and almo&s;t this whole circuit, par|ticularly towards the re&s;idence of the women, are &s;ur|rounded by a &s;trong fence of net-work, round which the night-guard patroles, and &s;everely puni&s;hes all in|truders. As there are no lights in the&s;e parts, nor any tents near them, it frequently happens that peo|ple
<PB N="80" REF="82">
who coming to the camp by night, ignorantly &s;traggle thither, are &s;ure to be ill-treated, when that happens. None but officers in immediate waiting, are permitted to enter the royal pavilion. The officers of &s;tate and people in bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;tand in the open air, in all wea|thers, forming a &s;emi-circle in front of the tent. If they are brought to an&s;wer for their conduct, they are held under the arm, by a proper officer to pre|vent their e&s;cape, or committing any other acts of violence. The &s;ame ceremony is ob&s;erved towards foreign emba&s;&s;adors, and great men, under pretence of re&s;pect; but, in truth, it is done to prevent any accident, or attempt being made on the Shah's life. The tents of per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, are, for the mo&s;t part, oblong, and are &s;upported by three poles, the out&s;ide of coar&s;e, cotton cloth, which is glazed, to prevent the rain from penetrating; the in&s;ide, lined with woollen or &s;ilk, according to the different &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and the circum&s;tances of the owner. The ground is &s;pread, with a thick cotton cloth, or matt, and over that is laid a carpet, or woollen, printed cloth, of &s;everal colours, and of Briti&s;h manufacture; be&s;ides this, the floor is laid with felts, which &s;upply the place of bed&s;teads and feather-beds, though &s;ome have their beds rai&s;ed above the ground, to avoid the damps. The top and &s;ides of the tents of great officers, are &s;ometimes lined with pannels, on which flowers, and a variety of figures
<PB N="81" REF="83">
are wrought. The back is appropriated for women, but &s;uch grandees as have &s;everal women, place a &s;et of tents at a di&s;tance from their own, which are &s;ur|rounded with cotton-cloths, to prevent their being &s;een. The part of the camp call'd the camp market, begins at the end of the &s;quare, fronting the guard-room, and is near half a mile long; it con&s;i&s;ts of tents on each &s;ide, like a &s;treet, running as direct as the nature of the ground will admit, the tents are filled with provi&s;ions, apparel, hor&s;e-furniture and other nece&s;&s;aries brought for &s;ale, together with a va&s;t property ari&s;ing from the daily con|fi&s;cations of the Shah. The care of the market is com|mitted to an officer, who rides up and down, to keep order, and when any di&s;putes ari&s;e, they are brought be|fore the <HI>Deroga Bazar</HI> or &s;uperintendant of the market, who acquires a con&s;iderable income from rents, fees, pre&s;ents and extortions. The &s;hop-keepers are little bet|ter than common &s;utlers; but &s;uch as carry on great bu&s;ine&s;s, are under the protection of the principal cour|tiers, who are the grand dealers in flower of rice, of which there is always a great con&s;umption: and as the&s;e courtiers have frequently &s;upernumerary &s;ervants, camels and mules, they &s;end them to the di&s;tant provinces that produce rice, which they bring to the camp for &s;ale and make great profits. But if the &s;hop-keepers, or traders, interfere with them in the&s;e branches of trade, they gene|rally mark them for de&s;truction. <HI>Nadir</HI> us'd frequently to enquire the price of nece&s;&s;aries, reduc'd them as he thought proper, and fin'd the market-people upon every

tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, but the mo&s;t notorious in&s;tance of inju&s;tice, to &s;hop-keepers was his obliging them, when his tents and their appurtenances were grown old, to take them and pay him the value of new ones.</P>

<P><HI>To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hmas Kouli Khan,</HI> or as he afterwards called him|&s;elf, <HI>Nadir</HI> Shah, was born in the year 1687, at a village, or more probably in a tent, a few days jour|ney to the &s;outh ea&s;t of Me&s;ched, not far from Kaelat. He was de&s;cended from the Affhars, a tribe of Tar|tars, &s;ubject to Per&s;ia, that live by hu&s;bandry, and &s;upply the Per&s;ians with hor&s;es and cattle. <HI>Nadir's</HI> father earned his bread, by making caps, and &s;heep-&s;kin coats, which is the apparel of the lowe&s;t order of common people in Per&s;ia. <HI>Nadir</HI> was bred to no other employment than that of a &s;hepherd, and being only thirteen years of age, when his father died, was left in &s;o poor a condition, that he was obliged to gather &s;ticks in woods, for the &s;upport of him&s;elf,

and mother, and carry them to market, on an a&s;s and a camel, which were his only patrimony.</P>
<P>It is recorded of him, that when he returned, in triumph, from his conque&s;t of India, he chanced to pa&s;s the place of his nativity, where he made a &s;et &s;peech to his chief captains, and particularly men|tioned his father's camel, concluding to this effect, <Q>You now &s;ee to what a height, it has plea&s;ed the Almighty, to exalt me; from hence learn not to de&s;pi&s;e men of low e&s;tate.</Q> When he was &s;even|teen or eight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en years of age, the Ou&s;bec or U&s;bec Tartars, made an inva&s;ion into Khora&s;an, or Chora&s;&s;an; they put many of the inhabitants to the &s;word, and reduced others to &s;lavery; among the la&s;t, <HI>Nadir Kouli</HI> and his mother: &s;he died in captivity, but he made his e&s;cape, in 1708, and returned to Chora&s;&s;an. From this time we hear no more of him, 'till, with &s;ome of his companions, he &s;tole a flock of &s;heep; the mo|ney which this produced, enabled him to retire to the mountains; he, however, did not continue the profe&s;|&s;ion of a robber, but entered into the &s;ervice of a Bey or lord, by whom he was employed as a courier, and was once &s;ent, with di&s;patches of importance, to the Per&s;ian court of I&s;pahan, in company with another courier. Whether <HI>Nadir</HI> was ambitious, of being the &s;ole carrier of the&s;e di&s;patches, or whether his fellow-courier did not travel fa&s;t enough, or for what other &s;ecret rea&s;on, it is unknown, but he killed him. After

his arrival at I&s;pahan, he told his &s;tory &s;o well, as to procure admittance to the Mini&s;ters, of Shah Sul|tan <HI>Hu&s;&s;ein,</HI> to whom he a&s;&s;igned &s;uch plau&s;ible rea&s;ons for his conduct on the road, that he was not only ac|quitted, but received pre&s;ents, and was &s;ent back with an&s;wers, to the letters he had brought. His ma&s;ter received him with &s;uch a countenance, as gave rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect he meditated his de&s;truction. <HI>Nadir</HI> perceived it, and re&s;olved to kill him al&s;o, and he was the more induced to this, from a violent pa&s;&s;ion he had conceived for his daughter, whom he had de|manded in marriage, but was refu&s;ed. After the murder was perpetrated, he took the lady away, and retired to the mountains. The effect of this enterprize, was the birth of <HI>Riza Kouli Myrza,</HI> who&s;e genius and di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o much re&s;embled his father's. This ac|tion acquired him the reputation of courage, and be|ing joined by &s;ome of the dome&s;tics of his late ma&s;ter, he became a robber, and continued &s;o for &s;ome time, at length, he offered his &s;ervices to <HI>Babulu Khan,</HI> go|vernor of Chora&s;&s;an, by whom he was accepted, in the capacity of gentleman-u&s;her.</P>
<P>It may appear &s;trange, that the chief of a gang of robbers, &s;hould have an honourable office be&s;towed on him, by the governor of a province; but when it is con&s;idered, that per&s;onal courage, was the greate&s;t re|commendation, and more prevalent, than virtue, or any polite accompli&s;hments; it may &s;omewhat reconcile the
<PB N="85" REF="87">
conduct of the governor of Chora&s;&s;an. In 1717, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Per&s;ia began to increa&s;e, and he had not been long in the &s;ervice of <HI>Babulu Khan,</HI> before the command of an army was given him, to proceed again&s;t the Tartars, who were making va&s;t inroads on the frontiers of Chora&s;&s;an; many of the officers re|fu&s;ed to &s;erve under their new general, and their places were filled by tho&s;e whom <HI>Nadir</HI> approved of.</P>
<P><HI>Nadir</HI> was &s;ucce&s;sful in his expedition, and elated with victory, returned, in triumph, to Me&s;ched, where he was received with joy. The fire of his ambition blazed, and he demanded to be confirmed in his office of general, under the command of <HI>Babulu Khan:</HI> who a&s;&s;ured him he would write to the court, in his favour, and that nothing &s;hould be wanting on his part, to reward his merit. Whether <HI>Babulu Khan</HI> deceived him, or whe|ther the weak admini&s;tration of Shah &s;ultan <HI>Hu&s;&s;ein</HI> evaded the promotion of <HI>Nadir,</HI> is uncertain, but he retired from Me&s;ched with chagrin, and &s;ought new adventures, after having been beaten, on the &s;oles of his feet, by order of the Khan, for abu&s;ing the go|vernor; declaring it his opinion, that he had not acted as a man of honour. <HI>Nadir</HI> was again turned loo&s;e into the world, and &s;ought to retrieve his fortunes, and to obtain revenge; but we &s;hall pa&s;s over the various and many wonderful vici&s;&s;itudes of his life, and give only his general character, and a few of his tran&s;actions, after he was created king.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88"><HI>Nadir</HI> had always an eye to the crown, but to acquire it, he found it nece&s;&s;ary, to wear an appearance of ju&s;tice; for the di&s;traction he had occa&s;ioned in Per&s;ia, by his con|que&s;ts and cruelties, left him with very few friends whom he could tru&s;t; but his own relations, and tho&s;e whom he had exalted to the principal po&s;ts, were true to the cau&s;e he had undertaken. By his artifice he depo&s;ed the reigning Shah, under the pretence of his incapacity to govern, and crowned the Shah's &s;on, an infant in the cradle; and having corrupted the principal officers of &s;tate, as well as his own generals, he called an a&s;&s;embly the next day and harrangued them, declaring the in&s;ufficiency of the Shah <HI>Toehmas,</HI> whom he advi&s;ed to be dethroned, and his &s;on immediately crowned. The di&s;cour&s;e met with the applau&s;e his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations could &s;ugge&s;t, from tho&s;e who were intirely his creatures. Shah <HI>Toehmas</HI> was declared inca|pable of holding the reins of government; the young in|fant was brought in his cradle, and the diadem fixed on the right &s;ide of his head, as a mark of &s;overeignty. <HI>Nadir</HI> fir&s;t took the oath of allegiance on the Koran, and po&s;tra|ted him&s;elf in homage to the new king, and the great officers followed his example. Thus did this great and wicked man, under the &s;pecious pretence of promoting the honor and intere&s;t of his country, prepare the way to a&s;|cend the giddy heights of his ambition. He &s;eemed already to look down on the in&s;truments of his pride, as wretches who were a&s;&s;iduous in forging their own chains. <HI>Nadir</HI> and his creatures now gave laws, not &s;o much in the form of a regency, as in con&s;equence of their offices; he acquired

the a&s;cendence, and in fact was &s;overeign. Orders were i&s;&s;ued, to notify the acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Abas</HI> III. to the throne. He was now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of unlimited power, and might have gra&s;ped at the crown, but he was not ignorant of the dan|ger that attended the attempt; his ambition and policy, he &s;ea&s;oned with patience, till his army was more accu&s;tomed to his authority, and received more demon&s;trative proofs of his abilities. In the mean while, he marched again&s;t the competitors of the crown, and conquered the neigh|bouring princes, who contended again&s;t his u&s;urpation, and having now the entire regency, quickly &s;eated him&s;elf on the throne.</P>
<P>On the 11th of March, 1736, under the name of <HI>Nadir</HI> Shah, the people paid him homage, and he accepted the crown, with an air of dignity, mixed with arrogance. An Armenian patriarch, performed part of the ceremony, but the plume and diadem, he changed from the left &s;ide, to the right, to &s;hew, that to his own arm only, he was indebted for his exal|tation. This in&s;trument of divine wrath, now accom|pli&s;hed his end, and reached a point which <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> could not obtain, though in valour, genero&s;ity and &s;trength of mind, this celebrated Roman was not inferior to the Per&s;ian u&s;urper; yet he excelled him in learning politene&s;s and humanity, to which <HI>Nadir</HI> had never any preten&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="91"><HI>Cromwel</HI> was baffled in many of his attempts, and neither, by &s;kill or valor, could he &s;ucceed. Rome, though corrupt in the extreme, and ripe for a change of that form of government, by which &s;he had ar|rived at &s;o high a pitch of glory, had yet &s;ome hone&s;t &s;pirits, who thought the killing of a tyrant warrantable, or at lea&s;t not &s;o great an evil as &s;lavery. In Eng|land there were numbers, who&s;e principles were un|tainted, and who &s;aw the error committed, in attempting to change the monarchy, into a republican govern|ment; but in Per&s;ia, ignorance, prevailed with corrup|tion of manners, and prepared the necks of the peo|ple, for the yoke, to which they then &s;ubmitted; and in a few years after, they &s;aw pyramids of human heads erected on the &s;pot, where they cho&s;e their king. <HI>(See the plate, Per&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nadir,</HI> being at the &s;ummit of his glory and ambition, tempered the natural fiercene&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, with &s;ome acts, of munificence; he entertained the people, and among other amu&s;ements, was that of &s;hooting an arrow at a gold plate, which was fixed on a lofty pole; tho&s;e who &s;hot down the mark, were to receive it for their &s;kill, together with a coat of honour.

the king who conquers the world."</P>
<P>Being now at the height of his ambition, <HI>Nadir</HI> thought of nothing but to enrich him&s;elf; accordingly he prepared for an expedition again&s;t India; his &s;ucce&s;s was rapid, like <HI>Caezar,</HI> he came, he &s;aw and conquered; victory now &s;eemed to court the ambitious <HI>Nadir,</HI> and elate with the hope of giving laws to that va&s;t empire, he affected a more than common &s;tate, ob&s;erved a &s;trict admi|ni&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and attended regularly to bu&s;ine&s;s; kept people to proclaim his victories, and a con&s;ider|able number of young men, with &s;tandards of red &s;ilk, were ordered to attend on particular occa&s;ions. The preparations to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s at the court of the Mogul, &s;eemed to give him no concern; on the contrary, he prepared him&s;elf, to receive homage from the Indian lords. Having given battle to the Indian forces, and &s;ubdued them, he &s;ent a letter to their general, &s;aying that he knew the Mogul's trea|&s;ure, and added, "I had intended to put your em|peror and his troops to the &s;word, but I will favour them; go and tell him to come to me, and we will make up our quarrel in a convenient manner." <HI>Mahomed Shah,</HI> the Indian king, was conducted to his tent, and placed by his left &s;ide; he then ad|dre&s;&s;ed him, &s;aying, that riches were his chief object, he wi&s;hed not deprive him of his empire, and a&s;&s;ur|ed him that his life &s;hould be &s;ecure; that after he had received the &s;ub&s;idy he demanded, and which
<PB N="90" REF="93">
mu&s;t be paid, he would leave him in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dominions. <HI>Mahomed Shah</HI> heard his determi|nation, with &s;orrow and confu&s;ion; for language &s;o foreign to a court, could not but touch the heart of a king, who&s;e weakne&s;s did not amount to in&s;en|&s;ibility. <HI>Nadir</HI> had nothing to fear from his military power, for his own army amounted to near one hun|hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and men; he &s;uffered him therefore to retire to his own camp. <HI>Mahomed Shah</HI> gave orders for the dead bodies of his &s;oldiers, which were &s;pread for near twelve miles, to be interred; and at the &s;ame time, gave up the military che&s;t to <HI>Na|dir,</HI> with all it's trea&s;ures. <HI>Nadir Shah,</HI> like <HI>Alexander,</HI> was victorious wherever he went; the Indians gave way at his approach, and quietly &s;ubmitted, a prey to his unbounded avarice. He marched his troops through all their chief cities, where after the manner of the Ea&s;t, every hou&s;e and &s;hop was &s;hut; not a &s;oul appeared in the &s;treets, but a mournful &s;ilence every where prevailed, as if it pre&s;aged &s;ome dreadful calamity. If the unhappy Indian ventured to de|fend him&s;elf, he was in&s;tantly killed, or in torture &s;uffered to linger, with the lo&s;s of his no&s;e and cars. So barbarous was <HI>Nadir,</HI> that the people often went in a body, and, in tears of angui&s;h and di&s;|tre&s;s, pro&s;trated them&s;elves and begg'd for bread. The inhabitants of any con&s;ideration, were obliged to de|clare under their hand-writing, what money and ef|fects they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of, and if they concealed any
<PB N="91" REF="94">
thing, they were puni&s;hed with the utmo&s;t &s;everity. <HI>Nadir</HI> aimed the &s;haft at all, and millions felt the wounds he inflicted; amid&s;t the din of war, all &s;en&s;e of humanity was confounded, and every noble &s;enti|ment, yielded to his in&s;atiable thir&s;t of accumulating riches. <HI>Nadir,</HI> in imitating the celebrated Macedonian here, forgot his virtues; like him, he was the idol of his &s;oldiers, until his cruelties became too enormous, but he never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the genero&s;ity of <HI>Alexander;</HI> where the one was beloved, the other was feared, and where compa&s;&s;ion is due to the memory of <HI>Alexan|der, Nadir's</HI> can only excite our hatred and rai&s;e our indignation. The natural greatne&s;s of mind in men, born to empire, &s;eems to find no object adequate to it, except in conque&s;t, but, to lead to true great|ne&s;s, the mind &s;hould be cultivated by an enlightened education, which <HI>Nadir</HI> never experienced; and even if he had, his heart was by nature, too depraved, to reach the &s;ummit of perfect heroi&s;m.</P>
<P>His cruelty was extreme, and his avarice, no le&s;s &s;o; for, according to <HI>Hanway,</HI> he took from the In|dians, eighty &s;even millions, five hundred thou&s;and pounds, of Engli&s;h money; of which &s;um, &s;even mil|million, five hundred thou&s;and pound, was in gold and &s;ilver, the remainder in the plate, rich manufac|tures, &amp;c. of the great Mogul and the Indian lords. Cruelty was a kind of diver&s;ion to <HI>Nadir,</HI> and was excited by his avarice, and jealou&s;y of his own &s;ecu|rity, as well as a habit of in&s;en&s;ibility: yet, he was
<PB N="92" REF="95">
remarkable for his love of women, and in India he cau&s;ed the bellies of eighty &s;oldiers, to be ripped open, for no other crime, than being pre&s;ent, when one of their comrades, forced an Indian woman. He is &s;aid to have had a virgin brought to his bed, every night, for &s;ome years before his death, but contented him|&s;elf, at the clo&s;e of his life, with thirty-three. In his wars in Turkey, he often carried his &s;eraglio with him. No king ever inflicted puni&s;hments in a grea|ter variety, or with circum&s;tances, more &s;tudied or rever&s;ed than <HI>Nadir;</HI> they are too &s;hocking and nu|merous to relate, but an in&s;tance or two may not be unacceptable. Two per&s;ons of di&s;tinction wrote to him &s;everal times, complaining of each other, he &s;ent for them to the camp, and pronounced them both ra&s;cals. <Q>And &s;ince, &s;aid he, you are &s;o fond of troubling me with epi&s;tles, I will &s;poil your &s;port;</Q> and accordingly he ordered their eyes to be put out. His wantonne&s;s in cruelty was not le&s;s apparent, when he ordered a man's teeth to be pulled out, for no other rea&s;on, than their being buck-teeth. But amid&s;t all his cruelty, he &s;till could feel, and his &s;a|vage ferocity could yield to the dictates of nature; for when his &s;on, <HI>Riza Kouli,</HI> attempted his life, and told him to his face, he was a tyrant, and ought to die, and that the mo&s;t he could do, was to kill him, for an attempt upon his life; the afflicted <HI>Nadir</HI> in|treated him to think of his crime, and a&s;k pardon. <Q>Con&s;ider, &s;ays he, I am your general, your &s;ove|reign, your friend, your father; con&s;ider the duty

The indecent mention of a woman of honour and di&s;tinction, is no le&s;s di&s;re&s;pectful in Per&s;ia, than in the polite parts of Europe; con&s;equently, it is the highe&s;t indignity, to mention, in gro&s;s terms, the fa|vourite wife of a king; and <HI>Riza Kouli</HI>'s expre&s;&s;ion was the mo&s;t in&s;ulting he could u&s;e.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar puni&s;hment, was likewi&s;e, inflicted on the &s;oldier, whom <HI>Riza Kouli</HI> employed, to kill his fa|ther: when he was at the pa&s;s, where <HI>Alexander</HI> pur|&s;ued <HI>Be&s;&s;us,</HI> the Bactrian traitor, he was wounded in the hand, and would have been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, but for the intrepidity of the eunuchs round him; the &s;ol|dier made his e&s;cape, and was not taken, till above a year after the fact; when &s;eized, he was led to the camp,
<PB N="94" REF="97">
and confe&s;&s;ed what he had done. <HI>Nadir,</HI> &s;aid to him <Q>You are a very brave fellow, but to prevent your taking &s;uch good aim again, you mu&s;t lo&s;e your eyes.</Q> Though nece&s;&s;ity obliged <HI>Nadir,</HI> to de|prive his darling &s;on of his &s;ight, he lamented at pa&s;&s;ing &s;o har&s;h a &s;entence, repugnant to his &s;enti|ments of affection, and with a mixture of paternal tenderne&s;s, admired his genius, and intrepidity, and hoped to have pre&s;erved him, to continue the diadem in his family; hut finding him &s;till un&s;haken, he never after permitted him to have any women, nor would he tru&s;t him, in any place, but under his own eye. As he grew old, his avarice and cruelty &s;eemed to vie with each other, for at I&s;pahan, he committed barbarities, beyond any of the former years of his reign.</P>
<P>This ancient city, which the civil wars had nearly reduced to ruin, he &s;eemed determined to complete; he made heavy exactions, put numbers of the in|habitants, to death, and burnt many of the Indian and Armenian merchants alive; re&s;trained by no ties of ju&s;tice, nor the tears of the mi&s;erable; by no re|gard of ho&s;pitality, nor the protection due to &s;tran|gers, he tortured and put to death, by the mo&s;t in|human methods he could devi&s;e. Such oppre&s;&s;ion, bar|barity and tyranny, mu&s;t ever meet with untimely fate, and though <HI>Nadir,</HI> u&s;ed frequently to &s;ay, he con&s;idered him&s;elf &s;ent by Providence, to correct the wickedne&s;s of men, and made that a plea for his inhumanity, yet neither
<PB N="95" REF="98">
his own intrepidity, nor the va&s;t power he commanded, could protect him from that Providence he had in&s;ulted; for, &s;oon after his departure from I&s;pahan, he fell a victim to his own oppre&s;&s;ion, and was killed in the act of the mo&s;t &s;anguine violence. On the plains of Sultan Meydan, about twenty-four miles from Me&s;ched, he called together the chiefs of the Ou&s;begs, Turkumans, and Tartars, who compo&s;ed his army, and, having &s;worn them to &s;ecrecy, di&s;clo&s;ed a de&s;ign of putting to the &s;word, all the Per&s;ians in his camp, and that he would fire a &s;ky-rocket, as a &s;ignal for the ma&s;&s;acre; and when this work was done, he would load them with money and great honors, purpo|&s;ing after he had erected a huge pyramid of Per&s;ian heads, to retire and end his days at Kaelat. A Georgian &s;lave in <HI>Nadir's</HI> tent accidentally overheard part of this bloody plot, and di&s;covered it to another, who at night &s;ent to the principal of the Per&s;ian officers, and communicated the in|telligence. Minds, tinctured with jealou&s;y &s;oon caught the alarm, and belief was &s;oon confirmed; under &s;o fatal an extremity no re&s;olution could be taken, but that <HI>Nadir</HI> him&s;elf &s;hould die.</P>
<P><HI>Saleh Beg,</HI> an officer of courage, and colonel of a body of Afhars, offered his &s;ervice for that purpo&s;e, and de|manded only four cho&s;en men as followers. The time of <HI>Nadir,</HI> going to re&s;t was pa&s;t, and it was but a few hours before the &s;ignal for the intended ma&s;&s;acre was to be given. <HI>Saleh Beg</HI> and his followers, under a pretence of urgent bu|&s;ine&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed the guard and, ru&s;hing into the outward
<PB N="96" REF="99">
partition of the Haram, met an eunuch whom they di&s;|patched, from thence they proceeded through the Haram and, in their way, met an old woman, whom they killed likewi&s;e. They knew not where <HI>Nadir</HI> &s;lept, till by the light of a lamp they di&s;covered jewels; here they ru&s;hed in and found him. When the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins approached him, <HI>Nadir</HI> drew his &s;abre, and demanded what bu&s;ine&s;s they had; <HI>Saleh Beg</HI> made no reply, but cut him with his &s;abre on the left &s;ide of his collar-bone; this did not prevent the Shah's collecting him&s;elf &s;ufficiently, to kill two of the the &s;oldiers, who came up to fini&s;h their leader's bu&s;ine&s;s; he was then going, from the tent, when the cords of it trip|ped him up, and <HI>Saleh Beg,</HI> gave him a mortal wound. <HI>Nadir</HI> cryed "Mercy and I will forgive you all," to which this officer replyed, <Q>You have not &s;hewn mercy, therefore merit none.</Q> <HI>Saleh Beg</HI> having performed this bu&s;ine&s;s, cut off <HI>Nadir's</HI> head; but, the Tartars, to whom the tyrant had always &s;hewn a preference, began to revenge his death, and fell on the Per&s;ians with incredible fury, &s;o that before day-light, above five thou&s;and men on both &s;ides were &s;lain; the Tartars were &s;hewn the &s;laugh|tered body, but in&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing his head al&s;o, when being &s;atisfied he was dead, the whole remaining army in|&s;tantly di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>This ended the life of a man, who&s;e actions made &s;uch a &s;plendid figure, even in the European world; had he been con&s;igned to his grave, in&s;tead of being de&s;tined for a diadem, many a &s;tream of blood, ma|ny

a million of trea&s;ure, had been &s;aved to his coun|try; but we mu&s;t leave him to revi&s;e his own actions, &s;ince he is in the hands of that Judge, who&s;e law it is our honor and happine&s;s to obey, and who&s;e coun&s;els it is impiety to &s;crutinize. As we have be|fore ob&s;erved, it is not our intention to dwell long or enter minutely, into the motives of his actions, and to unravel the foldings of a heart, mixed and compo&s;ed of qualities, unintelligible upon common prin|ciples.&mdash;The reader, will however not be di&s;plea&s;ed with our digre&s;&s;ion, and will forgive the following little narrative, taken from <HI>Hanway,</HI> &s;ince it has been re|marked, that ballads, and the &s;imple tales of the in|ferior part of mankind, often mark the character and &s;pirit of the times, with as much energy as the labor of the hi&s;torian. Mr. <HI>Otter,</HI> of the academy of Pa|ris, received this remarkable &s;peech, from a pea&s;ant of Per&s;ia, on his being que&s;tioned, why he did not cloath his daughter better. "You (&s;ays the Pea&s;ant) a&s;k this que&s;tion much at your ea&s;e, but I fancy you do not know <HI>Nadir Shah.</HI> In&s;tead of thinking of our cloaths, it is well if we can get a mor&s;el of bread; are we not obliged to &s;ell all we have, to find him money, and prevent our being ba&s;tinadoed to death? They now demand of me three Tomans, (30 Crowns) I know not where to get them: my cattle, my flocks and my moveables, are already carried off, by the Shah's collectors. I have only two or three &s;heep left, who&s;e milk &s;erves to nou|ri&s;h
<PB N="98" REF="101">
me, and this poor, little girl, whom I would gladly &s;ell, even to a foreigner, If I could get for her the &s;um they demand of me; &s;he can never be in a wor&s;e condition than &s;he is here, e&s;pecially if &s;he &s;hould have the misfortune to lo&s;e me, which mu&s;t infallibly happen, if I am not in a condition to pay this money." But, to return to our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians have very little maritme &s;trength. In the gulph of Per&s;ia, they once had between 30 and 40 &s;hips, &s;ome built in Europe, and &s;ome in Pegu and Surat, but they were generally navigated by Indians and Portugue&s;e. Their &s;hip-carpenters are mo&s;tly Indians, who perform their bu&s;ine&s;s with neat|ne&s;s, but are very &s;low, and unfit for large work, neither do they under&s;tand much of the &s;tructure of ve&s;&s;els, or the manner of navigating them. They have a &s;ea-coa&s;t of 300 leagues to the &s;outhward, and the Ca&s;pian-Sea, to the North, where they for|merly built &s;hips to protect them&s;elves again&s;t the Co&s;&s;acks. The Mu&s;covites generally tran&s;port Per|&s;ian merchandize in their own ve&s;&s;els, and have the navigation of the &s;ea nearly to them&s;elves; which has rendered their conque&s;ts ea&s;y, on that &s;ide, and if the coa&s;t was fortified, and could be con&s;tantly &s;upplyed with ammunition from Mu&s;covy, it would be difficult for the Per&s;ians to remove them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of their Revenue.</HEAD>
<P>THE lands of Per&s;ia, are either &s;uch as are in occupation, or &s;uch as are not; that is, &s;uch as are cultivated, or &s;uch as are uncultivated, of which the latter, are ten to one more than the former. The lands are of four kinds; the lands of the &s;tate, the deme&s;ne lands, the lands of the church, and tho&s;e of private men. The lands of the &s;tate, are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the governors of provinces, who receive from them, their own revenue, and a&s;&s;ign the re&s;t for the payment of their officers, and the troops they are obliged to maintain; for, every &s;oldier has his pay a&s;&s;igned him, on &s;ome village or farm.</P>
<P>The deme&s;ne lands are the king's e&s;tate, out of which the officers of the hou&s;hold are paid, and the &s;upernumerary troops, which the king maintains; the re&s;idue, is given among the courtiers and favourites, or managed by the vizirs and intendants, who remit the produce of them into the trea&s;ury. The lands of the church, are the donations of their princes, or pri|vate men, and are accounted &s;acred; they are never taxed, on confi&s;cated for any crime; and, after a year's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the title of them cannot be called in que|&s;tion. The lands of private gentlemen, are holden of the crown, for the term of ninety-nine years, paying
<PB N="100" REF="103">
an incon&s;iderable, annual rent, and at the expiration of the above term of years, they are allowed to renew, by advancing one year's income. If a per&s;on wi&s;hes to build on unoccupied lands, he mu&s;t obtain a grant from the Crown, for ninety-nine years, and pay a &s;mall annual rent. So that all ranks of men derive their e&s;tates from the Crown, as among&s;t us, and there &s;eems little other differ|ence, but that the Per&s;ians have a term renewable at plea&s;ure, and our free-holders have an inheritance; but both acquire a perpetuity, by payment of their fines; and accu&s;tom'd rents. The King has a right to a third of the produce of the lands, and the grain of Per&s;ia being &s;ub|ject to much injury from hail, locu&s;ts, and other in&s;ects, the tenants in&s;i&s;t on an abatement in &s;uch ca&s;es, and a&s;&s;em|ble in multitudes of &s;even or eight thou&s;and, round the palace at I&s;phan. The court &s;end orders to the Re|ceivers, to make &s;uch allowances as the ca&s;e requires, and and to inve&s;tigate the truth of the complaints; but the court is always defrauded; for the country-men &s;o well under&s;tand the force of bribes, that they commonly make a pur&s;e and procure a favourable repre&s;entation of the ca&s;e, from the King's officers. The king has likewi&s;e a third of the hu&s;bandman's cattle. Governors of provinces, are obliged, from time to time, to make large pre&s;ents to the court, of the be&s;t the country affords, whether &s;ilk, grain, fruits, cattle, or whatever is in e&s;teem among&s;t than, and the&s;e are &s;ent in gratuities, &s;ufficient for the king's hou&s;ehold, and therefore may be accounted a con|&s;iderable part of the revenue. The King has al&s;o the &s;eventh
<PB N="101" REF="104">
fleece, and the &s;eventh of the breed of the cattle of tho&s;e lands, which are not appropriated to his u&s;e, which adds greatly to the revenue; for the &s;hepherds of Per&s;ia, like the ancient patriarchs, po&s;&s;e&s;s va&s;t flocks and herds, on which they con&s;tantly attend; living in tents, and remov|ing from one place to another, as they can find pa&s;ture; for lands, unoccupied by particular per&s;ons, are free for all men to graze on, and are deemed the King's; the pay|ment of the &s;eventh bea&s;t is an acknowledgement of his dominion and property. The King has an officer in every province, to in&s;pect the &s;hepherds, and to &s;ecure the &s;e|venth of the cattle for his &s;ervice; of hor&s;es, he is entitled only to every third colt.</P>
<P>Minerals and precious &s;tones belong to the King only; and he has two <HI>per cent.</HI> of all money. The money that is rai&s;ed by the waters increa&s;es the revenue; for every per&s;on mu&s;t pay for its being let into his fields and gar|dens; the country being &s;o parched, nothing will grow without &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The tribute of a ducat is paid to the Crown, by tho&s;e who are not of the religion of the country, whether natives or foreigners. The cu&s;toms and port-duties belong to the revenue; but tho&s;e do not amount to much; for they have no con&s;iderable port, except Gombroon. Merchandize, carried in and out of Per&s;ia, pays only a &s;mall &s;um for a camel's load, and in proportion for every mule or ox, without examining the packs. There is a tax of ten-pence on every &s;hop of working trades, and twenty-pence on the re&s;t. All
<PB N="102" REF="105">
handicraft trades pay no duty to the Crown, but they are obliged to work for the King, when he requires it, without pay, which &s;aves the trea&s;ury a great deal of money, and which may well be e&s;teemed a part of the revenue: but that which exceeds all, is the benefit ari&s;ing from contingencies; namely, what is derived from the confi&s;cation of e&s;tates, and the pre&s;ents made by lords, governors of provinces, &amp;c. and particularly tho&s;e on new-years-day. They pre&s;ent the King with wrought &s;ilks, hor&s;es, a&s;&s;es, beautiful boys and girls, gold, &s;ilver, precious &s;tones, perfumes, and every thing rich and curious, or that may contribute to luxury, and the plea&s;ures of life. The people are not oppre&s;&s;ed or impoveri&s;hed by the&s;e pre&s;ents, but appear in ea&s;y cir|cum&s;tances; and there are few, either trade&s;men or hu&s;bandmen, who do not wear rings on their fingers and arms. There is no poll-tax in Per&s;ia, except on tho&s;e who are of a different religion. It is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain the amount of the revenue of the Crown, it depending &s;o much on contingencies; but it may, one year with another, be reckoned at four millions &s;ter|ling; which, con&s;idering that their troops are paid from the lands of the &s;tate, is very con&s;iderable. But, as the &s;plendor and magnificence of the Per&s;ian court is much beyond what we &s;ee in Europe, little remains at the end of the year. The court, with the women, the eunuchs, and other officers and &s;ervants, &s;eldom con|&s;i&s;ts of le&s;s than ten thou&s;and per&s;ons, which belong to the hou&s;hold; and, including the troops of the great
<PB N="103" REF="106">
men, and their dependents, it mu&s;t require an im|men&s;e &s;um to maintain them.</P>
<P>All bargains in Gombroon are made for <HI>&s;hahees,</HI> and the Company keep their accounts in them, reckoning them worth four-pence each; though that coin is rarely met with, but, in its &s;tead, <HI>coz</HI> and <HI>mamoodas</HI> are cur|rent every where; ten coz being equal to one &s;hahee, and two &s;hahees equal to one mamooda; two hundred &s;hahees make a <HI>toman,</HI> equal to 3l. 6s. 8d. Engli&s;h. Hor&s;es, camels, hou&s;es, &amp;c. are generally &s;old by the toman; and they u&s;ually reckon their e&s;tates this way. Such a one, they &s;ay, is worth &s;o many tomans, as we &s;ay pounds, in England.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians have five &s;eals, which are u&s;ed in five &s;everal branches of bu&s;ine&s;s; one concerns the deme&s;ne lands; a &s;econd is u&s;ed for commi&s;&s;ions, letters patent, &amp;c. a third, for military affairs; a fourth, for the reve|nue; and another, for things relative to the hou&s;hold. There are no arms engraven on them; but on one, are the names of the twelve Imans, or Patriarchs; on ano|ther, a &s;crap of the Alcoran; or &s;ome pious expre&s;|&s;ion, &s;hewing their dependence on God, and his pro|phet Mahomet. They are made of turquoi&s;es, rubies, emeralds, or &s;ome precious &s;tone, about the &s;ize of a crown-piece. The principal &s;eal the King always wears round his neck, and on Fridays, all in&s;truments, which require the royal &s;eal, are carried to the palace, and im|pre&s;&s;ed before the King, on a kind of thick ink.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of their Government, Laws, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE government of Per&s;ia is monarchical, and, in every branch of it, &s;trictly de&s;potic. The favor of the Prince, and of tho&s;e on whom his authority de|volves, is e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ecurity of foreign merchants; and this is be&s;t procured by proper and timely pre&s;ents, by a good appearance, and a re&s;olute, di&s;creet &s;upport of their own dignity. The Per&s;ians are not un&s;killed in the laws of ju&s;tice and humanity; but war having been, for many years, their only &s;tudy, and a fondne&s;s for outward &s;hew their predominant pa&s;&s;ion, their laws are but little regarded, when they interfere with their inclinations: hence a good hor&s;e, a &s;ilver-mounted bridle, and a girl, will generally induce a Per&s;ian to violate ju&s;tice, and even to commit that, for which he is morally certain of death.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual title of the king of Per&s;ia is <HI>Shah,</HI> or <HI>Pat|&s;haw,</HI> the Di&s;po&s;er of Kingdoms; which is the highe&s;t in A&s;ia, and equivalent to that of Emperor, in Europe. They add al&s;o to the king's titles, tho&s;e of Sultan, and <HI>Caun,</HI> or <HI>Cham,</HI> which is that of the Tartar Sovereign. To acts of &s;tate, the Per&s;ian monarch does not &s;ub|&s;cribe
<PB N="105" REF="108">
his name; but oftentimes, in his patents, enume|rates the &s;everal kingdoms and provinces under his do|minion. His &s;ubjects addre&s;s him, as The mo&s;t re|nowned of all men living; The &s;ource of power, ma|je&s;ty, and glory, equal to the &s;un, &s;ub&s;titute of hea|ven, Object of all men's vows, Ma&s;ter of the conjunc|tions, Head of the mo&s;t excellent religion, Prince of the faithful, Shadow of the Almighty God, Father of vic|tory, Lord of the revolutions of the world, Di&s;po&s;er of thrones and crowns. With the&s;e, or &s;uch like titles, petitions are given to the throne; but, when they &s;peak to the King, they u&s;ually &s;tile him, The Lieutenant of God, or "the Prince, through whom God di&s;pen&s;es his grace and favor to men." Tho&s;e of the blood Royal, are &s;tiled <HI>Mizza,</HI> which &s;ignifies, the Son of a Prince.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians, like the Romans, prefer all men in|differently to po&s;ts in the &s;tate, and in the army. The gown-men &s;ometimes command as generals, and &s;ol|diers &s;it as judges in the courts of ju&s;tice; and the &s;ame per&s;on has been prime-mini&s;ter and high-prie&s;t: but they generally take care to prefer the native Per&s;ians to civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical employments. The highe&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tic in every town is a judge, and tries civil cau&s;es under the governor, who generally refers the parties to him; and, upon the receipt of his verdict, the governor gives a final judgement. There is &s;eldom any regard paid to a per&s;on's birth or fortune in his promotion; but the King di&s;po&s;es of places, as he apprehends his
<PB N="106" REF="109">
&s;ubjects are qualified for them. They enjoy their po&s;ts during life, and &s;ometimes their children after them, when they have behaved well; and there are in&s;tances where a government has continued in a family for many generations; but, as the favourites of the court are al|ways endeavouring to promote their own creatures, this &s;eldom happens.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t mini&s;ter in the kingdom is the <HI>Atamandoulet,</HI> a word which &s;ignifies the &s;upport of the empire: when he is addre&s;&s;ed, he is &s;tiled the grand Vizir. No bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence is tran&s;acted in the &s;tate, but by the direction of this mini&s;ter, nor any grant or act of &s;tate of the king's, held to be valid, till counter-&s;ealed by him. The rea&s;on is, that their kings, being bred up with women, are perfectly ignorant of affairs of &s;tate; it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary for the welfare of the people and the good order of government, that their commands &s;hould be con&s;idered by a wi&s;e mini&s;ter before they are are inforced. The king is a mere cypher, and of no other u&s;e, but to &s;anction the publick acts, the prime mini&s;ter being, in reality, the king; who when his age renders him unfit to attend public bu&s;ine&s;s, is permit|ted to retire to his family, and end his days in peace. The &s;econd po&s;t in the government is that of the <HI>Divan Bey,</HI> who&s;e office may be compared to that of our lord chief ju&s;tice, and &s;ometimes to that of our lord chancellor, but have <HI>Divans,</HI> or a council, to whom the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice is committed; the&s;e magi&s;trates decide on all cau&s;es, civil, or military, except when the king in per&s;on &s;its in judge|ment.
<PB N="107" REF="110">
The Divan Bey, or Lord, can command any cau&s;e to be removed to his tribunal, from any court in the kingdom; and, during the late reigns, no king has been known to concern him&s;elf, in examining the decrees of the Divan Bey. In the third rank come the generals; and next, the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, who regi&s;ters the public acts, and has the care of the records. He appoints al&s;o a deputy in every province of the empire, who tran&s;mits all affairs of con&s;equence, to be laid before the mini&s;try. The la&s;t great officer is the <HI>mirab,</HI> or lord of the water, who &s;uperintends the aquaducts. Every province has its mirab; for, in &s;o dry a country, it is nece&s;&s;ary all &s;hould have an equal &s;hare of water. Amba&s;&s;adors, and foreigners, tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s with the <HI>nazir,</HI> or trea&s;urer and &s;teward of the hou&s;ehold; who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great influ|ence, but is not permitted to pay any money from the trea&s;ury, unle&s;s the order bears the &s;eal of the prime-mi|ni&s;ter, the chief ju&s;tice, and two other officers of the revenue. The ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e has &s;tuds of hor&s;es in every part of the kingdom, and appoints officers to &s;uper|intend them. The royal-hunt&s;man is not le&s;s powerful, having a thou&s;and hunt&s;men and falconers at his com|mand. They breed for the cha&s;e, lions, ounces, pan|thers, and dogs; and have hawks, and birds of prey, which are bred to attack wild bea&s;ts, as well as birds.</P>
<P>After the&s;e, the principal phy&s;ician holds his &s;eat; to|gether with the a&s;trologer, which are places of great honor and profit. There is al&s;o a high-chamberlain,

who always &s;tands behind the king. A white eunuch likewi&s;e attends his maje&s;ty, who has greater influence than any round the court. He &s;erves the king on his knees at table, ta&s;tes his meat, dre&s;&s;es and undre&s;&s;es him, commands his wardrobe, and has the government of the eunuchs of the palace; he never leaves his maje&s;ty, but when he vi&s;its the ladies. He carries a little box, covered with precious &s;tones, in which he has two or three fine handkerchiefs, opium, perfumes, and cordials, with which he &s;erves him, whenever he may call for them. He is very powerful, becau&s;e he has &s;o many opportunities of ingratiating him&s;elf; and is equally feared and re&s;pected by his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>In every province of Per&s;ia there is a governor, who is often as de&s;potic as a &s;overeign prince. Military cau&s;es are always tried by the&s;e governors, who, though they are accountable for all their actions, and have often their ears cut off, and no&s;es &s;lit, and are &s;everely beaten on the back, ba&s;tinadoed on their feet, till their nails come off, and not unfrequently &s;trangled, yet, they &s;eldom ab&s;tain from acts of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion; &s;o great is their love of cruelty, and their fondne&s;s of &s;hewing the extent of their power.</P>
<P>The governors, in their re&s;pective provinces, live in almo&s;t as much &s;tate as their &s;overeign, having the &s;ame kind of officers as the king. They enjoy the &s;ame titles, and there is &s;carce any difference, but in their numbers,
<PB N="109" REF="112">
and their pen&s;ions. The governor commands the militia of the province, and a&s;&s;igns lands for their maintenance; he reviews them, and &s;ees they are fit for &s;ervice; ex|amines their arms and hor&s;es, and ob&s;erves their manoeu|vres. There are officers under them, appointed to watch their conduct, and to oppo&s;e them, if they commit any thing again&s;t the &s;tate. If a governor returns from his command, which he never does, but by expre&s;s order of the court, he waits without the gate of the palace, and gives notice of his arrival, by &s;ome friend; who reports, that he attends, to throw him&s;elf at his maje&s;ty's feet. Orders are then given for his admittance, unle&s;s he has been guilty of great mi&s;conduct; in which ca&s;e, he is not &s;uffered to appear, but an order is di&s;patched from the prime-mini&s;ter, and &s;ealed by the king, for his imme|diate execution. The per&s;on who bears the mandate, cuts him in pieces with a &s;abre, crying out, when he falls on him, "By the king's command." Whenever a mini&s;ter is di&s;graced, his whole e&s;tate is withheld; and he experiences &s;o great a rever&s;e of fortune, until the king's plea&s;ure be known, that no man dares give him, even a cup of water. If he is acquitted of the charge again&s;t him, he is re&s;tored again to his family and pro|perty.</P>
<P>The civil and canon-laws of the Per&s;ians are blended together. Mahomet contrived this, in imitation of the law-givers of old; who, to enforce their laws, pretended their injunctions were the dictates of heaven. This great
<PB N="110" REF="113">
Impo&s;ter had an eye to the Jewi&s;h law, e&s;pecially the book of Leviticus, where the civil law and ceremonies are mingled together. According to the principle of the Ma|hometans, the &s;ame per&s;on bears the &s;piritual and tempo|ral &s;word, and is both high-prie&s;t and king; he commands in war, and admini&s;ters ju&s;tice, explains the articles of faith, and regulates the eccle&s;ia&s;tical dicipline, as the patriarchs of the Jews did; and, as the patriarch of their religion, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, u&s;ed to do for the fir&s;t five ages.</P>
<P>According to the Per&s;ian doctors, the civil magi&s;trate ought not to concern him&s;elf in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, any further than to execute &s;uch &s;entences as the clergy pronounce. But the temporal power retains its authority, and does not allow the clergy any other &s;hare in the &s;upreme court of ju&s;tice, than to give their opinion in difficult ca&s;es. The Alcoran is their chief law-book; and if their deci&s;ion is not clear, by the precepts it con|tains, they refer to <HI>"The &s;ayings, and acts of Mahomet;"</HI> and afterwards to tho&s;e of the <HI>Imans;</HI> but in general they do not con&s;ult books, determining, without any regard to the writings of the Alcoran. The laws of the Per&s;ians are not always &s;trictly ob&s;erved; for, if they were, Chri&s;tians would not be able to live in Per&s;ia, any more than Jews and Pagans; but would be every day &s;ubject to abu&s;e and plunder, from the precepts of the Alcoran; at lea&s;t, as they are explained and interpreted by their doctors; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the in&s;ults of the vulgar, who are frequently &s;o bigotted to their &s;uper&s;tition, and incen|&s;ed
<PB N="111" REF="114">
by the clergy, again&s;t all who differ from them, that there have been in&s;tances of outrages committed on fo|reigners, purely on account of religion; and the influence of the prie&s;ts is &s;ufficient to &s;creen from puni&s;hment, all offences committed again&s;t Chri&s;tians, as well as Pagans.</P>
<P>The Imans teach, that no faith is be kept with tho&s;e of another per&s;ua&s;ion, and that it is lawful to deprive Infidels of their goods and e&s;tates. From hence, probably our di&s;|&s;enters derive their favourite tenet, that "Dominion is founded in grace; and the world, with its abundance, was intended only for the godly;" &s;o that, with impunity, they defraud and plunder, and think they are fulfilling the de|crees of heaven, and doing a meritorious act, when rob|bing their fellow-creatures. Such baneful doctrine did our di&s;&s;enters avow, in the days of <HI>Cromwell!</HI> But, not|with&s;tanding the bigotry of a few affected puritans, the generality of the Per&s;ians re&s;pect us greatly, and think there is no nation, who&s;e merchants are more ju&s;t, or honorable in their dealings.</P>
<P>All facts are proved in court by living te&s;timony, and a man is at liberty to claim his right. Even the party's own deed will not exclude him, if he can prove any force, fraud, or impo&s;ition. Where there are no witne&s;&s;es, an oath is tendered to the per&s;on who denies the charge; and he is &s;worn upon the Alcoran with great &s;olemnity, the judge fir&s;t ki&s;&s;ing the book, which is enclo&s;ed in a linen cloth, and touching it with his forehead, pre&s;ents it him&s;elf
<PB N="112" REF="115">
to the per&s;on about to &s;wear, who puts his hand on, it when opened, and &s;wears to &s;peak the truth. If he is of a different religion, the judge &s;ends an officer with him to a prie&s;t of that religion. If a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> he &s;wears by the go&s;|pel; if a <HI>Jew,</HI> by the old te&s;tament; if an <HI>Indian Idolater,</HI> by his adored cow; and if a <HI>Gaur,</HI> or a wor&s;hiper of fire, he &s;wears by the flames. The rea&s;on they never &s;wear an unbeliever by the Alcoran, is becau&s;e he does not con&s;ider it as a divine book, and they fear he &s;hould profane it; of cour&s;e, forbid him even to touch the cover of it.</P>
<P>The women plead their own cau&s;es, and it is but decent they &s;hould. They are veiled, that they may acquire more a&s;&s;urance; and &s;et &s;ecluded from the court, collecting their arguments, and enforcing them with the mo&s;t bitter cries and lamentations. They never appear, but to &s;ue for a divorce, and the u&s;ual plea is impotence of the hu&s;band; &s;ailing not mo&s;t bitterly to bewail and lament, and to deafen the judge with cries and clamour.</P>
<P>In criminal cau&s;es the civil magi&s;trate never interferes, neither is the eccle&s;ia&s;tical law at all con&s;ulted. They are left entirely to the temporal courts, which determine ac|cording to the nature of the offence, and former pre&s;idents. The&s;e courts con&s;i&s;t of three per&s;ons, the pre&s;ident of the divan, the governor of the city, and the nazir. They have no public pri&s;on, and con&s;equently no &s;heriffs or jailors, who have the cu&s;tody of pri&s;oners but every magi|&s;trate confines the criminal, in his own hou&s;e, until he is
<PB N="113" REF="116">
brought to trial, which is within twenty-four hours after he is taken, and &s;entence is no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed, than it is executed. The &s;ervants of the judge perform the office of executioner. Criminals of &s;tate have the <HI>Carcan,</HI> or three-cornered yoke, round their necks, to which the right hand is fa&s;tened, and the king in per&s;on, &s;its in judgement, again&s;t &s;uch offenders. All tumults and riots are &s;everely puni&s;hed in Per&s;ia, and of cour&s;e &s;eldom happen; &s;o that murder and hou&s;e-breaking is very unfrequent. If a per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o unfortunate as to kill another, and the fact be proved before the judges, the offender is not puni&s;hed by the court, but is delivered to the friends of the decea&s;ed, who put him to death, in what manner they plea&s;e; all the relatives of the decea&s;ed a&s;&s;emble, and with loud cries, demand the ancient privilege of having the blood of him who had murdered their kin&s;man, which the magi&s;trate &s;eldom fails of promi&s;&s;ing them; but &s;ometimes the mur|derer, by pre&s;ents to the judge, and by giving money to the relations, obtains his pardon. If the relations per&s;i&s;t in having his blood, the judge gives him up, with the&s;e words. "I give you the murderer, according to ourlaw; make your&s;elves &s;atisfaction with his blood; but re|member, God is merciful." The judge's &s;ervants are then ordered to ob&s;erve the directions of the pro&s;ecutors, and guard him to the place they de&s;ire; whither they accompany him, with cur&s;es and abu&s;e. When he arrives at the place of de&s;tination, he is left to their mercy, and they often inflict the mo&s;t cruel tortures on the mi&s;erable wretch; even the women &s;tain their hands with the mur|derer's
<PB N="114" REF="117">
blood: but, &s;hould it &s;o happen, that life &s;hould &s;till remain in the offender after their departure, they cannot, by their laws, again return to complete the ex|ecution.</P>
<P>Ordinary crimes are u&s;ually puni&s;hed by fines, if the parties are men of &s;ub&s;tance; if not, they give them a number of blows on the &s;oles of their feet, not le&s;s than thirty, nor exceeding three hundred. Their feet are often very much &s;wollen with the blows, and turn black, and &s;ometimes the nails of their toes come off. The remedy they u&s;e, is to &s;et the unfortunate man in warm hor&s;e|dung, almo&s;t up to the middle, for &s;everal days; after which, they foment the parts with &s;pirits of wine. Pick-pockets, and pilfering rogues, are marked with a hot iron in the forehead, and hou&s;e-breakers have the right hand cut off. The &s;ame puni&s;hment is inflicted on tho&s;e who coun|terfeit money, for the fir&s;t offence, but, for the &s;econd, their bellies are ripped open.</P>
<P>For capital offences, the criminal's feet are tied to a camel, and, his head hanging down to the ground, his belly is ripped open, and his bowels hang over his head; after being dragged through the &s;treets, he is hung on a tree, by his heels, and is often &s;everal hours before he expires. They have other modes of puni&s;hing for capital crimes, by impailing, ca&s;ting from a rock, and many more too horrid for the feeling mind to dwell on.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="118">In Per&s;ia the deci&s;ion of cau&s;es cannot be protracted, to a tormenting or devouring length. Why they &s;hould be more tedious, in limited, than in ab&s;olute monarchies, ap|pears &s;trange, unle&s;s, in certain in&s;tances, &s;lavery is prefered to liberty, or the name of liberty, to the reality of it. The law is certainly an excellent, and nece&s;&s;ary profe&s;&s;ion, but two many are bred up to it; con&s;equently, in pur&s;uit of &s;upport, they deviate from the original de&s;ign, by perplex|ing, with injurious refinements, that which it is their duty to renderplain and intelligible.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of their liberal Arts, Learning, and Language.</HEAD>
<P>THE Per&s;ians, at this period, know little of painting or &s;tatuary. Their relegion, indeed, di&s;courages painting, &amp; the rigid Imans forbid the repre&s;entation of every created animal. Like the Chine&s;e, they attempt to imitate nature; but &s;he is pourtrayed in &s;o barbarous a manner, that they appear to have con&s;idered her as deformed. The Euro|peans far excel them in every liberal art; yet, their antiqui|ties are &s;omewhat curious, and evince a genius &s;uperior to the arti&s;ts of modern times. All the Mahometans are
<PB N="116" REF="119">
aver&s;e to &s;tatues and pictures, and are more &s;et again&s;t them, than the mo&s;t rigid of our di&s;&s;enters. A Mohe|metan would not, for his life, perform his devotions in a room of paintings; and, in this in&s;tance, they greatly re&s;emble the primitive Chri&s;tians, who, through their abundance of &s;anctity, covered the pictures of their &s;aints, whenever they were in company with their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; thinking thus to veil them&s;elves from their ob&s;ervation. Their pictures are &s;eldom drawn with a full face, becau&s;e they have not the &s;malle&s;t idea of giving life to their per|formances, by the judicious di&s;po&s;ition of light and &s;hade. Their flowers are better painted; and they have the ad|vantage of us in the brilliancy of their colours, which are vivid to a degree of beauty, which cannot be pre&s;erved in damp climates. However, the Per&s;ians have a few good paintings, and pre&s;erve the portraits of their celebrated poets, Hafez and Sadi. They are repre&s;ented at full length, and habited in the old Per&s;ian dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Poetry is held in great e&s;teem in Per&s;ia, and it is cu&s;|tomary, in common di&s;cour&s;e, to introduce moral &s;en|tences, and poetical narrations, from their writers; and a Per&s;ian never thinks he entertains his gue&s;t, unle&s;s he quotes different pa&s;&s;ages, and moral precepts, from &s;ome favourite poet. They &s;till pre&s;erve the &s;pirit of poetry, and have many traces of that fertility and &s;trength of ima|gination, for which, in times pa&s;t, they were de&s;ervedly famous.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="120">They have a number of &s;chools in every town, where Arabic is taught, which is con&s;idered a learned language; but the Alcoran is the &s;tandard of good language, both as to grammar and rhetoric. Men of fortune prefer private tutors for their children; and no nation is more attentive to the education of their young men, and to the training them to manly exerci&s;es. After they have been &s;ome time at &s;chool, they fini&s;h their education at college, where they are in&s;tructed in the principles of their religion. Their colleges are large, and are very richly endowed: the large&s;t of them have fifty or &s;ixty apartments, and to each of them are two chambers. At I&s;pahan there are fifty-&s;even colleges, mo&s;t of them of royal foundation; where there are profe&s;&s;ors of every &s;cience, who are paid annually by the &s;cholars: but many read lectures, and teach the liberal arts, <HI>gratis;</HI> and the&s;e are generally great officers, who have been di&s;carded, or have voluntarily retired from court. The&s;e frequently give books and paper to their pupils, and often entertain them at their hou&s;es, and by this means endeavour to regain their re|putation; for, nothing adds more to the dignity or ho|nour of a Per&s;ian nobleman, than to in&s;truct young men at their own expence, and be thus patrons of learning, and of learned men. They have no public di&s;putations, or lectures, as in England; but, when the collegians have made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the &s;ciences, they di&s;pute with their tutors.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="121">The Turki&s;h language is the mo&s;t common in Per&s;ia, and prevails on the &s;outhern part of the Ca&s;pian, as well as in tho&s;e provinces which were formerly conquered by the Turks. The pure Per&s;ic is little known, but in the &s;outh|ern parts, on the coa&s;t of the Per&s;ian gulph, and the con|fines of Arabia, and particularly at I&s;pahan. In matters of learning, they u&s;e Arabic; in which is depo&s;ited, the greate&s;t part of that knowledge, for which the Per&s;ians were once di&s;tingui&s;hed; and the polite people are fond of Arabian words, which renders their di&s;cour&s;e the le&s;s in|telligible to men of inferior rank. The learned languages, familiar to Europeans, are not known among&s;t them. As time &s;eems to have made no change in the cu&s;toms of A&s;ia, but the &s;ame manners remain, as we read of two thou&s;and years ago; &s;o the language, particularly the Per&s;ian, has the &s;ame ideom, and &s;ublimity of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They write, as the Hebrews did, from the right to the left, and often range their lines in an arbitrary man|ner, &s;o that, upon one leaf of paper, they &s;ometimes write in ten different directions, and this only to &s;how the writer's ability, in ob&s;erving the proportion of words and lines in each.</P>
<P>The language of the Per&s;ians is extremely beautiful; and, it is to be lamented, it is not introduced as an e&s;&s;ential accompli&s;hment, in the &s;y&s;tem of our educa|tion. It is a melancholy reflection, that whil&s;t years
<PB N="119" REF="122">
are be&s;towed in acquiring an in&s;ight into the Greek and Roman authors, that tho&s;e very writers &s;hould have been neglected, from whom the Greeks evidently derived, both the richne&s;s of their mythology, and the peculiar tendency of their expre&s;&s;ions. Mr. <HI>Ri|chard&s;on</HI> has entered into this &s;ubject with great abi|lity; and happy is it, for the advancement of learning, when men of genius differ in opinion, on themes of fair and rea&s;onable inve&s;tigation; for they &s;hew us, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, either to doubt with mode&s;ty, or to di&s;&s;ent with candour. <HI>Sir William Jones</HI> has publi&s;h|ed a beautiful hymn, addre&s;&s;ed to the God <HI>Camdes,</HI> which reflects much light on literary information. This God is the &s;ame as the <HI>Eros</HI> of the Greeks, and the <HI>Cupid</HI> of the Romans. His bow-&s;tring is compo&s;ed of &s;warming bees, and his arrows are tipped with flowers delicious to the &s;mell, but fatal to the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>To the ea&s;tern <HI>Kri&s;hen</HI> and <HI>Gopia,</HI> which are likewi&s;e mentioned in the above mo&s;t elegant compo&s;ition, are we indebted for the names of <HI>Apollo</HI> and the Mu&s;es. But, it is not amid&s;t the tender &s;hades of poetry alone, that the Per&s;ian &s;cholar may find plea&s;ure and in&s;truction. Hi&s;tory and philo&s;ophy &s;tand ready to receive their welcome gue&s;t, and to refre&s;h his weary &s;teps with whatever is curious or intere&s;ting. The etymologi&s;t too, will find an ample field in the &s;tudy of the Oriental tongue; and we hope to &s;ee the au&s;picious moment, when the maje&s;ty of ancient know|ledge &s;hall be again confe&s;&s;ed by mankind; for, learning
<PB N="120" REF="123">
has its link in the golden chain, with which providence has bound every thing together; and we cannot make a more noble or amiable u&s;e of our abilities, than by wiping away that ru&s;t of indolence, which has &s;o long defiled its beauty.</P>
<P>When, under the pretence of commerce, we became the cruel invaders of another's right, was it not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, we &s;hould at lea&s;t have made our&s;elves ac|quainted with the language of the conquered; but, private avarice &s;hut up the gates of public virtue. Victory di&s;|dained to twine around her &s;word, the wreath of &s;cience; and, although the Per&s;ian language is the language in which all bu&s;ine&s;s is nece&s;&s;arily tran&s;acted, yet, there never was any advancement made by us in &s;uch literature, till the publication of Sir <HI>William Jones,</HI> who is now placed at the head of a learned &s;ociety at Bengal, and has it in contemplation, to publi&s;h annually, an A&s;iatic Mi&s;|cellany. What is there we may not hope from his benevolent exertions.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ian <HI>Gazel,</HI> or ode, is very &s;imilar to that of <HI>Anacreon</HI>'s&mdash;"dropping odours, dropping wine;" and, whether <HI>Anacreon</HI> borrowed the gaity of his odes from the Gazel, or whether the divine <HI>Hafez,</HI> inirched his native language, by an imitation of the <HI>Trean</HI> bard, it is not ea&s;y to determine. The &s;imilarity of &s;en|timent is oftentimes wonderful; and it may with equal truth be &s;aid of both, that they wrote not &s;o much
<PB N="121" REF="124">
to the under&s;tanding, as to the heart.</P>
<P>The curious reader will find much entertainment, in the peru&s;al of the very elegant tran&s;lations of the Per&s;ian Gazel, publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Nott,</HI> and to whom I am principally indebted, for the foregoing ingenious ob&s;ervations on the Per&s;ic poetry.</P>
<P>Having conducted our readers over the regions of poetry, the connexion leads us to con&s;ider mu&s;ic, the &s;i&s;ter art; but here we find no dulcet tones to &s;ooth the pen&s;ive ear, but a barbarous mixture of &s;ounds that little &s;uits, the extreme tenderne&s;s and delicacy of their poetry. The tuneful mu&s;e &s;eems to have trembled at their religion, which forbad her to be wooed by the nobles of Per&s;ia. Under &s;uch op|pre&s;&s;ion has the mu&s;ic of this poetical country ever laboured. It is true, they have a number of different in&s;truments, which are &s;o rudely con&s;tructed, as to afford but indifferent harmony. They have no pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the &s;cience; and con&s;equently, its refinement, being in the hands of the inferior cla&s;s of people, can make but little progre&s;s.</P>
<P>A&s;trology is much &s;tudied in Per&s;ia; and particularly by the natives of Chora&s;anwho are celebrated for this art. They teach the art of divination, and interpret dreams; they have charms for all di&s;&s;ea&s;es, and take their &s;pells, and authorities, from the Alcoran, which they render
<PB N="122" REF="125">
as they plea&s;e, according to the nature of the cir|cum&s;tance. They have a number of phy&s;icians, who, with the a&s;trologers, do great injury to the country, in&s;omuch, that they are become proverbial. Yet, &s;o great is their authority and influence over all, that even the King entertains va&s;t numbers in his pay; and they are no le&s;s feared than re&s;pected.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians make u&s;e both of the &s;olar and lunar year; the la&s;t, for their fe&s;tivals, which are appointed on certain days of the month, and for their religious ceremonies. Their months begin, and end, with the moon, and con&s;equently, their years are &s;horter than ours, by eleven days. But their &s;olar year con&s;i&s;ts of 365 days; which is of an ancient date, for <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> &s;peaking of <HI>Darius</HI>'s train, &s;ays, that the <HI>Magi</HI> were followed by 365 particular per&s;ons, according to the number of the days of the year, which, con&s;i&s;ting of 12 months, &s;even had thirty days, and five thirty-one days, a piece, which compleated the 365</P>
<P>The year begins at the time of the equinox; and it is the part of the a&s;trologer to make an exact ob|&s;ervation, by the a&s;trolabe, of the very minute when the &s;un, coming to the equator, enters into Aries. This day they call <HI>Naurus,</HI> or <HI>Neurus;</HI> that is, the new day; and when they are to make any computa|tion of their age, they &s;ay they have lived, or com|pleated, &s;o many Nauru&s;es, or years. Their epoch
<PB N="123" REF="126">
begins with the Hegyra, or flight of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which is coincident with the 10th of July, 622 years after the birth of our Saviour.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians have fallen into a great ab&s;urdity in their manner of in&s;tructing. It is common to &s;ee boys, reading le&s;&s;ons out of the Koran, in Arabic, which they do not under&s;tand; and, to add to this farce, as they &s;it, they make a motion with their head, and body, alledging, that this helps &s;tudy. Thus does affectation &s;upply the place of real learning. They acknowledge, that the Europeans have an univer&s;al &s;kill in arts and &s;ciences, to many of which they are en|tire &s;trangers; and their pre&s;ent mode of education is not likely to remove this evil.</P>
<P>Thus the revolutions of time, and the changes to Which human affairs are &s;ubject, in con&s;equence of men's iniquity, have involved tho&s;e nations in igno|rance, who once enjoyed all the advantages which could grace and adorn human nature; and who were di&s;tingui&s;hed as patterns of learning and politene&s;s.</P>

This great philo&s;opher was &s;truck with the demon|&s;tration of the perfections of that &s;elf-exi&s;ting Being, who is the author of all good. Being at a lo&s;s to account for the introduction of evil into the world, he imagined there were two principles; one, the cau&s;e of good, which he repre&s;ented by light; the other, that of evil, which he figured to him&s;elf by darkne&s;s. He con|&s;idered light as the mo&s;t perfect &s;ymbol of true wi&s;|dom, and intellectual endowment; and darkne&s;s, the repre&s;entative of things hateful and de&s;tructive. From hence he was led to inculcate an abhorence of all images, and to teach his followers to wor&s;hip God, only, under the form of fire, con&s;idering the bright|ne&s;s, purity, and incorruptibility of that element, as bearing the mo&s;t perfect re&s;emblance to the nature and perfection of the good Deity. For the &s;ame rea|&s;on, the Per&s;ians adore the Sun, and think the throne of die Almighty is &s;eated in it. In the compo&s;ition of this world, good and evil, being mixed together, they believed they would continue till the end of all things, when each &s;hould be &s;eperated and reduced
<PB N="125" REF="128">
to it's own &s;phere. The ancient Per&s;ians erected no temples, but offered their &s;acrifices in the open air, and generally on the top of a hill; for they e&s;teemed it injurious to the maje&s;ty of the God of heaven, to &s;hut up, in walls, Him to whom all things are open, whom the world cannot contain, and to whom the whole earth, with regard to man, &s;hould be e&s;teemed a hou&s;e, or temple.</P>
<P>Another philo&s;opher, of the name of <HI>Zoroa&s;ter,</HI> aro&s;e about 600 years after the former, near the conclu|&s;ion of the reign of <HI>Darius,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Hye&s;ta&s;pas,</HI> who undertook to reform the articles of their religion. He maintained, there were two angels, one, of light, the other, of darkne&s;s, who were at perpetual variance with each other; and that, where the angel of light prevails, there good ari&s;es; and where the &s;pirit of darkne&s;s, there evil predominates. He affirmed, that this oppo&s;ition would remain till the clo&s;e of the world, when there would be a day of judgment, on which all would receive a ju&s;t retribution according to their works; after which, the angel of darkne&s;s, and his followers, would be &s;eperated, to eternity, from light; and tho&s;e who cultivated and cheri&s;hed the &s;piritual nature, and obeyed the angel of light, &s;hould go into a world, triumphant, amid&s;t everla&s;ting brightne&s;s, and &s;hould receive rewards due to their good deeds. The&s;e opinions, in &s;ome &s;ort, are &s;till pre&s;erved; and many of the ancient Per&s;ians, &s;till hold a &s;trict veneration for
<PB N="126" REF="129">
fire. To the everla&s;ting fire, near the city of Baku, pilgrims continue to flock, to expiate their own &s;ins, and tho&s;e of others, marking their foreheads with &s;affron, wearing very little apparel, living on wild ce|lery, or a kind of Jeru&s;alem artichoke, and keeping one arm, in &s;ome particular po&s;ition, they remain un|alterably fixed in their attitude.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians acknowledge the Koran, as fir&s;t pro|mulged, to be the great law of their prophet <HI>Maho|met;</HI> but they trace their eccle&s;ia&s;tical divi&s;ions and inveterate animo&s;ities, as high as his immediate &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or <HI>Ali-way, Mohomet</HI>'s brother's &s;on, and married to <HI>Fatima,</HI> the daughter of that fal&s;e prophet. From this, the Per&s;ians naturally infer his right to the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, which was invaded by his uncles, <HI>Abubker, Omar,</HI> and <HI>O&s;man,</HI> the brothers of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> who&s;e u&s;urpation, both, as kings and Prophets, is approved by the Turks. At length, <HI>Ali</HI> &s;ucceeded, and the di&s;pute might have been lo&s;t in oblivion, had he made no difference in the Koran: yet, this produced no extraordinary effects till the 14th century, when <HI>Sheffie,</HI> a man of exemplary life, who pretended a re|gular de&s;cent from <HI>Ali,</HI> began to teach and expound the Mahometan law, and the doctrine of <HI>Ali</HI>'s fol|lowers, in preference to the Turki&s;h doctors of divi|nity. This revived the remembrance of the injury done to <HI>Ali,</HI> by his uncles, whom the Per&s;ians began to cur&s;e in their public prayers. They al&s;o changed
<PB N="127" REF="130">
the form of the Mahometan creed, by giving <HI>Ali</HI> the title of "the friend of God". The&s;e two &s;ects being divided, tho&s;e who maintained the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Abu|beker, Omar</HI> and <HI>O&s;man,</HI> called them&s;elves <HI>Sunnis;</HI> whil&s;t the followers of <HI>Ali</HI> took the name of <HI>Schias.</HI></P>
<P>Experience has proved, how impo&s;&s;ible it is, to keep mankind &s;teady to any form of wor&s;hip, even where they profe&s;s the &s;ame faith in e&s;&s;entials; and if this is the ca&s;e, where religion is founded in truth, as in that of Chri&s;t, it is no wonder, that &s;o ab&s;urd a doc|trine as that of Mohomedani&s;m, profe&s;&s;ed by &s;o many millions of people, &s;pread over &s;uch a va&s;t tract of country, &s;hould create di&s;&s;entions, with regard to ce|remonials, and the con&s;truction of texts in them&s;elves inexplicable: nor is it &s;trange, that this &s;hould produce national, and irreconcillable hatred.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians believe the Mo&s;aic to have been the true religion before Chri&s;t; whom al&s;o they acknow|ledge to have been a true prophet, and teacher, &s;ent by God; but that the religion he taught was contained in a book, which at <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s, coming, was taken by the angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> into heaven, and the Koran brought down in its &s;tead. This however they do not at|attempt to prove. They &s;ay al&s;o, that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> did not die upon the cro&s;s; but that another per&s;on was miraculou&s;ly brought there in his place: thus con|fe&s;&s;ing
<PB N="128" REF="131">
the truth of our Saviour's mi&s;&s;ion, but con|founding it with ab&s;urd fables.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians, in their prayers, acknowledge but one God; <HI>Mahomet</HI> is his prophet, and <HI>Ali</HI> his friend. They appear not to have that mode&s;ty, which pre|vails among chri&s;tians of the be&s;t &s;ort, who, to avoid the imputation of affectation or hypocri&s;y, are as zea|lous not to be &s;een on their knees, as afraid to commit any criminal action. If a bold, ma&s;culine piety, and a &s;incere awful &s;en&s;e of the &s;upreme Being, are ve|ry con&s;i&s;tent things, this excu&s;e of mode&s;ty mu&s;t be owing to an error in education. The re&s;ervedne&s;s of &s;ome chri&s;tians, is often carried to exce&s;s. Per&s;ons, pious before marriage, have been known to be con|fe&s;&s;edly negligent in their devotions afterwards; the prejudices of education being &s;uch, as that neither party cho&s;e to be &s;een on their knees; and neglect, we all know, &s;oon becomes a habit.</P>
<P>Not &s;o does the enlightened <HI>Milton</HI> paint our fir&s;t parents; not &s;o does nature or rea&s;on dictate. Surely this is not, what our Saviour meant by de&s;iring us to retire to our clo&s;et; and is diametrically oppo&s;ite, to what may be inferred from that pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, that the un|believing party, in marriage, is &s;aved by the believ|er. Such an exce&s;s of re&s;erve, if &s;uch is common, mu&s;t be injurious to religion, and highly de&s;tructive
<PB N="129" REF="132">
of the advantages derived to mankind, by the exam|ple of piety; particularly in the matrimonial &s;tate.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians &s;eem to be under the influence of enthu&s;ia&s;m; without which, devotion, in &s;ome men, is but a languid office. Their imaginations are warm; and we mu&s;t not judge of the &s;eeming extravagance of their expre&s;&s;ions, by our colder feelings. Their phra|&s;es and metaphors are highly ju&s;t and beautiful, al|though they may widely differ from the coolne&s;s ob&s;ervable in the Engli&s;h mode of devotion. Pa&s;&s;ion, in matters of religion, is certainly nece&s;&s;ary; and it &s;hould be left to nature her&s;elf to determine how far it &s;hould prevail: but a happy mixture of hope, love, and fear, under the influence and guidance of rea&s;on, con&s;titute that pa&s;&s;ionate warmth, which is not only warrantable, but, in many minds, e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>"Let thy words be few;" is an admonition well &s;uited to the weakne&s;s of human nature; and the ob|&s;ervance of it at the &s;ame time &s;hews the &s;trength of the under&s;tanding. But the Per&s;ians, in contradiction to this precept, and the experience of mankind, make long prayers. After wa&s;hing them&s;elves, and combing their beards, they often count beads, like &s;ome chri&s;tians, who probably learnt it from them. At certain parts of their prayer, they &s;tand; at others kneel; and pro|&s;trating them&s;elves on the earth, &s;et their forehead on
<PB N="130" REF="133">
a bit of clay, near the &s;ize of a crown piece, &s;up|po&s;ed to be brought from Mecca, and con&s;equently to have a charm. This they always carry with them, tied to the upper part of the arm. They have &s;tated hours of prayer, are punctual in their ob&s;ervance of this duty, and, to all appearance, perform it with more attention than chri&s;tians generally do: and although they are extremely immoral, they give one proof of religion greatly &s;uperior, to the chri&s;tians, for they &s;el|dom mention the name of the &s;upreme Being, except, on &s;olemn occa&s;ions, or at lea&s;t in a re&s;pectful man|ner. The Per&s;ians po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome Jewi&s;h rites among&s;t them; and, when they pray, never permit the image of any &s;en&s;ible object to be before them; nor is it allowed to pray, with any thing of gold about them, as if it was e&s;teemed an object of idolatry. They invoke the interce&s;&s;ion of the departed &s;ouls of &s;ome of their prophets and pious men.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to con&s;ider, in how many in&s;tances, the Per&s;ians demon&s;trate the highe&s;t &s;uper&s;tition. Snee|zing is held a mo&s;t happy omen, e&s;pecially when repeated often. The hands, with the fingers, interchanged, and &s;ome particular po&s;ture of the body, are con&s;idered as full of magic power, and, if u&s;ed maliciou&s;ly, of dangerous, con&s;equence. As their minds are tainted with a fondne&s;s of whatever is marvelous, and the belief of the agency of invi&s;ible power, on the mo&s;t trival occa&s;ions; they think the meteor that re&s;embles the falling &s;tars, and
<PB N="131" REF="134">
which are vulgarly called &s;o, are the blows of the angels on the heads of the devils, who would pry into the &s;ecrets of paradi&s;e. Cats are held in great e&s;teem, but dogs in abomination; &s;o that a dog is never permitted to come into a room; yet, they u&s;e them for a, diver&s;ion. The Turks are not much behind them in this folly. In the reign of <HI>Shah Abas,</HI> the grand &s;eignior &s;ent to that prince, to de&s;ire, that as none but their prophet, and his children, had been dre&s;&s;ed in green, none of his &s;ubjects might be permitted to wear that colour; e&s;pecially in &s;tockings. To this <HI>Shah Abas,</HI> who was a man of &s;en&s;e, made an|&s;wer, that, if the grand Seignior would prevent the dogs pi&s;&s;ing on the gra&s;s, in Turkey, he would comply with his reque&s;t. Innumerable are the in&s;tances of their ab|&s;urdity in the belief of invi&s;ible agents, and of their &s;uper|&s;tition in the u&s;ual occurences of life; but, it has ever prevailed, and has been common in a greater or le&s;s degree, to mankind of all religions, and in all countries. Happy it is for tho&s;e people, who profe&s;s a religion, which teaches them to acquie&s;ce in things &s;uperior to the rea&s;on and comprehen&s;ion of mankind. Our condition does not permit us to know every thing; it is again&s;t the laws of our nature, and con&s;equently a crime to attempt it. Thus, where our under&s;tanding is puzzled, in the fearful inve&s;tigation of the things which belong to God, we &s;hould pay our adoration and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the great author of nature, and place our humble and firme&s;t con|fidence in him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Country, Climate, Productions, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE word <HI>Pole,</HI> in the Poli&s;h language, &s;igni|fies a flat, level country; but that the king|dom, and the whole nation, derive their name from that origin, cannot be affirmed with any certainty. This large kingdom, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is two hun|dred German, or geographical miles, in length; and one hundred and forty in breadth, each mile being about four miles and a half Engli&s;h. Towards the north, it borders on Pru&s;&s;ia, Courland, Livonia, and Ru&s;&s;ia; and towards the ea&s;t, on Ru&s;&s;ia, and Little Tartary. To the &s;outh, it is bounded by Moldavia, Tran&s;ylvania and Hungary; to the we&s;t, by Sile&s;ia, Brandenburg, and Pomerania. The air is &s;omewhat cold, but &s;alubrious, and more temperate than might be &s;uppo&s;ed, from its northerly &s;ituation. The country is, for the mo&s;t part, level, and has but few hills. On the Carpath|ian mountains, which &s;eperate Poland from Hun|gary, the air is very cold; for it &s;nows there in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer; and, in &s;ome parts the
<PB N="134" REF="137">
&s;now never melts. The <HI>Bel&s;ciattan</HI> mountains are a continuation of the <HI>Carpathian</HI> hills. The kingdom of Poland con&s;i&s;ts of three principal provinces, Great Po|land, Little Poland, and the grand duchy of Lithu|ania. This divi&s;ion is of great utility, with regard to the public law of Poland; according to which, the nation con&s;i&s;ts of three di&s;tinct people.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of this country is extremely fertile, and yields plenty of grain; of which there cannot be a greater proof, than that near 400 ve&s;&s;els and floats, mo&s;t of which are laden with corn, annually pa&s;s down the Vi&s;tula, to Dantzick. In Podolia, Volkinia, and Ukraine, and the province of Ru&s;&s;ia, corn grows in va&s;t plenty, and with little; culture or manure. In great and little Poland, agriculture receives more attention and labour; but the harve&s;ts make ample amends for the care of the indu&s;trious pea&s;ants; The &s;oil of Lithuania is as fruitful as that of Podolia and Samogitia; though it was formerly very woody, and the greate&s;t part of it lay uncultivated, but having enjoyed much tranqui|lity, and the advantages of agriculture, it is become prodigious fertile, and produces a great quantity of wheat, and other corn, be&s;ides hemp and flax: it is likewi&s;e famous for honey. The meadows and pa&s;|tures afford nouri&s;hment for numerous flocks and herds; and the &s;heep yield fleeces of &s;uperior excellence. Po|dolia abounds with a fine breed of hor&s;es, and horn|ed cattle; but, in all ages, this country has been ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="135" REF="138">
to the inroads of barbarous nations, which, living on plunder, have often ravaged it in the mo&s;t cruel manner. So fruitful are its meadows, that gra&s;s of|ten grows to a wonderful height, and &s;ometimes a per&s;on cannot &s;ee the horns of the cattle that are grazing in the meadows. As an in&s;tance of the plenty of every kind of provi&s;ions, it is a fact, that from the year 1701 to 1718, during which time there were &s;everal armies in Poland, there was not the lea&s;t &s;car|city of bread. Poli&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia, is likewi&s;e a very fruit|ful country, and is remarkable for excellent pa&s;turage. Peat, oker of all kinds, chalk, belemnites, agates, chalcedonies, cornelians, onyxes, opals, ja&s;per, fine rock chry&s;tal, amethy&s;ts, granite, topazes, &s;apphires, and even rubies and diamonds, are found in Poland. This coun|try al&s;o affords, <HI>Mariengla&s;s,</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> gla&s;s, talc, allum, &s;alt-petre, amber, pit-coal, and an inexhau&s;table quantity of chalk, which is hewn out of the rocks in large blocks, and &s;alt &s;prings; al&s;o &s;par, quick&s;ilver, <HI>lapis calaminaris,</HI> iron, lead, a &s;mall quantity of tin gold, and &s;ilver; but there are no mines of the two la&s;t metals wrought in Poland. They have manna, which is produced from an herb that grows in the meadows and fenny grounds, and is gathered, in great quantities, from June, till the end of July. The Po|li&s;h kermes berries are always gathered in May, be|fore they are quite ripe, for in the month of July they &s;warm with in&s;ects, which leave a kind of pro|tuberance behind them, &s;o that the berries are ren|dered

unfit, either for dying or medicine. The coun|try abounds in mines of &s;alt, which is of different colours; but, when pounded, is of a dirty a&s;h-colour, like what we call brown &s;alt. The principal mines are at Boenia and Wieliczka; in the latter, are many &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, and in &s;ome of them are cha|pels and altars, hewn out of the &s;alt-rock. In the chapel, crucifixes, and the images of &s;aints, are &s;et up, carved of &s;alt, and a light is burning perpetually. The places where the &s;alt is hewn out of the mine, and the empty cavities from whence it has been taken, are called chambers; and &s;ome of them are &s;o &s;pa|cious, that a large church might be erected in them. In the&s;e chambers are ware-hou&s;es for the reception of &s;alt ca&s;ks, and magazines for the fodder of hor&s;es; and &s;tables, which contain numbers of hor&s;es em|ployed in the mines. In &s;ome places the tops and bottoms of the chambers are covered with thick moun|tains of &s;alt chry&s;tals, which, by the light of the can|dle, reflect the mo&s;t &s;urprizing lu&s;tre, and the mo&s;t beautiful rays. Pieces of coal, and petrified wood, are occa&s;ionally found buried in the &s;alt. The rocks of &s;alt are &s;o &s;tupendous, and of &s;uch an enormous ma&s;s, that they exhibit a wonderful phenomenon, in the natural hi&s;tory of the globe. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that this &s;pot was formerly covered with the &s;ea, from the appear|ance of the uppermo&s;t bed of the earth, as the &s;ur|face immediately over the mines, is &s;and; the &s;econd, clay, mixed with &s;and and gravel, and containing pe|trifactions

of marine bodies; the third, is of calcari|ous &s;tone. From hence, naturali&s;ts &s;eem to agree, that it is a gradual depo&s;it, formed by the evaporation of its waters. They trace back the working of the&s;e amazing, inexhau&s;table mines, above 600 years. How much earlier they were known, cannot be a&s;cer|tained.</P>
<P>Their profits are immen&s;e, and are appropriated to the King's privy pur&s;e, the annual average amount|ing to &pound;.97,222 4s. 6d. &s;terling. They now belong to the Emperor, being &s;ituated within the province which he di&s;membered from Poland; but are far from yielding a revenue equal to that which they afforded the King of Poland; for the Au&s;trian commi&s;&s;ioners imprudently rai&s;ed the price of &s;alt, from a notion, that Poland could not exi&s;t, without obtaining that commodity, as u&s;ual, from Wielit&s;ka; and would there|fore be obliged to receive it at any Price. This mode of proceeding offended the Poles, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, with his u&s;ual &s;agacity, did not neglect this opportunity of extending his commerce. He immediately imported large quantities of &s;alt, which he procured chiefly from Spain, to Dantzic, Memmel, and Koning&s;burg; from whence it was conveyed up the Vi&s;tula, into the interior provinces: by the&s;e means he furni&s;hed great parts of Poland with &s;alt, at a cheaper rate than the inhabitants could procure it from the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and, in 1778, the mines of Wielit&s;ka
<PB N="138" REF="143">
only &s;upplied the di&s;tricts which immediately border upon Au&s;trian Poland.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common way of manuring the ground, is by bur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">g; and, as they have va&s;t plains which lay un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">vated, and over-run with long gra&s;s, this is done without much labour. When the heart of one piece is worn out, they pur&s;ue the &s;ame method with another; being under no nece&s;&s;ity of continually plough|ing the &s;ame. Their ploughs are nearly &s;uch as ours, but are made of wood. The rea&s;on iron is not u&s;ed, is, that they fear it will damage their crops. Their ground is tilled, with &s;mall hor&s;es, or oxen, two of which are &s;ufficient; and wheat is generally &s;own, becau&s;e it is more profitable than Barley. Poland abounds in wood, &s;uch as oak, beech, pine, and fir-trees. It al&s;o yields abundance of honey and wax; and a great quantity of mead is made of the former; which liquor derives its name from the Poli&s;h word miode, &s;ignifying honey.</P>
<P>Great numbers of cattle are fattened in Poland, and &s;ent for &s;ale into Germany. The horned breed abound &s;o much, that 80 or 90,000 oxen, are annually driven out of the kingdom. Their hor&s;es are very &s;trong, &s;wift, and beautiful, and every where prolific. The fore&s;ts contain, deer, hares, wolves, foxes, bears, elks, wild-a&s;&s;es and oxen; and, in Ukraine, near Nieper, &s;heep and hor&s;es are found wild. The wild ox, was
<PB N="139" REF="144">
formerly very common in Europe; but exi&s;ts no where but in the Lithuanian fore&s;ts, in &s;ome parts of the Carpathian mountains, and in Cau&s;alus. The Bi&s;on, or wild-ox of America, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame, but rendered different by a change of climate. They have likewi&s;e an extraordinary creature, called Bohac, which much re&s;embles the Guinea pig, but is more of the nature of the beaver. They dig holes in the earth, which they generally inhabit in the month of October, and &s;eldom quit them but for food, till April. They have different apartments for their lodgings, provi&s;ions, and their dead; and live together, by ten and twelve in a herd.</P>
<P>In the rivers are innumerable &s;hoals of fi&s;h, and in the the country great quantities of tame and wild fowl. Their partridges, it is &s;aid, often turn white in winter, in the north part of Lithuania, the &s;ame as they do in Mu&s;covy. The eagle and vulture are very common among the birds of prey. Lithuania is remarkable for the beauty of its birds; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the <HI>remiz,</HI> or &s;mall &s;pecies of titmou&s;e, called <HI>parus pendulinus.</HI> It is curious in the &s;tructure of its ne&s;t, which is formed with wonderful art; the &s;hape is like a pur&s;e, compo&s;ed of gos-a-mer, and minute fibres, and lined with mo&s;s. The entrance is on the &s;ide, very &s;mall and round; and &s;o con&s;tructed, as to pre&s;erve the eggs, or little ones, from the &s;malle&s;t injury. It is &s;u&s;pended on the twig of a willow, or at the mo&s;t
<PB N="140" REF="145">
&s;lender extremity of &s;ome other tree, over a river; and &s;eldom lays more than four or five eggs.</P>
<P>There are many capital cities in the three provinces of Poland; War&s;aw and Cracow, which are the prin|cipal in the province of Great Poland. War&s;aw &s;tands on the Vi&s;tula, and in the centre of the kingdom, and is the royal re&s;idence. It is &s;urrounded by a moat, and double wall; and con&s;i&s;ts, of the old and new town, with two hand&s;ome &s;uburbs. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;everal elegant &s;tone buildings, and palaces, a great number of beautiful convents, and churches, an ho&s;pital, an ar&s;enal, and a &s;tatue of King <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> III. The valu|able library of Count <HI>Zulu&s;ki,</HI> opened in the year 1746, is &s;aid to contain about 200,000 volumes, and is both an ornament, and advantage to the city. Some years &s;ince, an academy, for military exerci&s;es, and a literary &s;ociety, were in&s;tituted at War&s;aw. The num|ber of inhabitants are computed at 80,000; among which, there are many foreigners. It wears rather a melancholy appearance, though its &s;ituation is plea&s;ant, being built on an eminence, from the banks of the Vi&s;tula, and occupies a va&s;t extent of ground. The &s;treets are broad and &s;pacious, but ill-paved. The palaces of the nobility are numerous and &s;plendid, but the greater part of the hou&s;es, are ill-con&s;tructed wooden hovels, particularly tho&s;e of the &s;uburbs. On the whole, it exhibits a confu&s;ed &s;cene, with the &s;trong contra&s;t of wealth and poverty, luxury and di&s;tre&s;s.
<PB N="141" REF="146">
A provincial a&s;&s;embly, or diet, and a court of judi|cature, is held here, on which account it is far pre|ferable to Cracow, which city di&s;putes the honor of pre-eminence with War&s;aw, for it was formerly the capital of Poland, where the Kings were elected and crowned; and was once near the centre of the Po|li&s;h dominions, but is now, a frontier town.</P>
<P>The royal palace is a noble edifice, beyond com|pari&s;on, the fine&s;t building in Poland. The apartments are well fitted up, and furni&s;hed in the Engli&s;h man|ner; being executed by the London arti&s;ts, and brought from there at the King's expence. The room called the hall of victory, from formerly having been a hall, is converted into a &s;aloon, hung with tape&s;try from Bru&s;&s;els; the ceiling, pannels, door-ca&s;es, and window frames, are all neatly executed in white carving, gilt. The rooms are very numerous, and all the offices, for a court, extremely convenient.</P>
<P>The fortifications at War&s;aw are &s;ufficient to pre|vent the towns being in&s;ulted by flying parties, or &s;mall armies, but could not &s;tand a &s;iege of any du|ration, again&s;t an army well provided. Its walls are good, and flanked with ba&s;tions, and tolerably lined with artillery; the ditch is broad and deep, and the waters of the Vi&s;tula may be let in at plea&s;ure; but the extent of the&s;e fortifications is too great, to be defended effectually, with le&s;s then eight thou&s;and
<PB N="142" REF="147">
men. War&s;aw is populous, it being the capital of Poland; and the mi&s;erable &s;tate of mo&s;t of the other towns throughout Poland, has contributed greatly to its increa&s;e. There are many Poli&s;h families re&s;ide in it, which were once in af|fluence, but now reduced to live in a very mean way. Speaking of War&s;aw, the re&s;idence of the pre|&s;ent King of Poland, and the city where the court is held; we will take the opportunity of mentioning the court, as de&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> in his enter|taining travels with Lord <HI>Herbert.</HI> "The Engli&s;h mini&s;ter being ab&s;ent, in the country, we carried our letters of recommendation to Count <HI>Rzewu&s;ki,</HI> great mar&s;hal of the crown, who received us with much civility, and appointed Sunday morning to pre&s;ent us to the King, at his levee.&mdash;At the hour appointed, we repaired to the court, and were ad|mitted into the audience-chamber, where the prin|cipal officers of the crown were waiting for his Maje&s;ty's appearance. In this chamber, I ob&s;erved four bu&s;ts, placed by order of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty; namely, tho&s;e of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> queen of England; <HI>Henry,</HI> IV. of France; <HI>John Sobie&s;ky,</HI> and the pre&s;ent Em|pre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia. At length the King made his ap|pearance, and we were pre&s;ented. His Maje&s;ty talked to each of us a con&s;iderable time, in the mo&s;t obliging manner; he &s;aid many hand&s;ome things of the Eng|li&s;h nation, mentioned his re&s;idence in London, with great appearance of &s;atisfaction; and concluded,
<PB N="143" REF="148">
by inviting us to &s;upper in the evening; of which honour we had before had previous intimation from the great mar&s;hal. The King of Poland is hand|&s;ome in his per&s;on, with an expre&s;&s;ive countenance, a dark complexion, roman no&s;e, and penetrating eye; he is uncommonly plea&s;ing in his addre&s;s and manner, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great &s;weetne&s;s of conde&s;cen&s;ion, tempered with dignity. He wore a full dre&s;&s;ed &s;uit; which circum&s;tance I mention, becau&s;e he is the fir&s;t King of this country, who has not worn the national habit, or who has not &s;haved his head, after the Poli&s;h cu&s;tom. His example has, of cour&s;e, had many imitations: and I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o few of the nobility in the national garb. The natives in general are &s;o attached to this dre&s;s, that in the diet of convocation, which a&s;&s;embled previous to the election of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, it was propo&s;ed, to in&s;ert in the <HI>Pacta Conventa,</HI> an article, whereby the king &s;hould be obliged to wear the Poli&s;h garment; but this motion was over-ruled, and he was left at liberty to con&s;ult his own ta&s;te. At his coronation, he laid a&s;ide the ancient regal habit of ceremony, and appeared in robes of a more modern fa&s;hion, with his hair flowing upon his &s;houlders.</P>
<P>The levee being ended, we went over the palace, which was built by <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> III. and which, &s;ince his time, has been the principal re&s;idence of the Poli&s;h
<PB N="144" REF="149">
monarchs. The palace &s;tands upon a ri&s;ing ground, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the Vi&s;tula, and commands a fine view of that river, and the adjacent country. Next to the audience-chamber, is an appartment fited up with marble, which his maje&s;ty has dedicated, by the following in&s;cription, to the memory of his predece&s;&s;ors, the kings of Poland, <HI>Regum memoriae dicavit Stani&s;laus Augu&s;tus bocce momentum,</HI> 1771. The portraits of the &s;overeigns are ranged in chronological order: the &s;eries begins from <HI>Bole&s;laus,</HI> and is carried down to his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, who&s;e picture is not fini&s;hed. The&s;e heads are all painted by <HI>Bacciarelli,</HI> and well executed. The portraits of the earlier kings are &s;ketched from the painter's imagination; but that of <HI>Ladi&s;laus</HI> II. and mo&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, are copied from real originals. Altogether they produce a plea&s;ing effect, and may be con&s;idered as an agreeable &s;pecies of genealogical table. In the adjoining apartment are hung the heads of the members of the king's literary &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The court days do not exhibit any great circle of Po|li&s;h lords. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the kingdom are not only in oppo&s;ition to the crown, but even in open arms again&s;t it: but the officers, who are obliged to at|tend the nobles of the king's party, together with foreign mini&s;ters, and Ru&s;&s;ian officers, fill the room pretty well.</P>
<P>Cracow &s;tands on a &s;pacious plain, near the Vi&s;tula, and occupies a va&s;t extent of ground. The inhabitants
<PB N="145" REF="150">
&s;carcely amount to 16,000, &s;o badly is it peopled. The hou&s;es are, for the mo&s;t part, of &s;tone; and many of them well built, and were once richly furni&s;hed, and very magnificent; but mo&s;t of them, at this period, are unin|habited, or in a melancholy &s;tate of decay. The town exhibits the remains of ancient magnificence; and, from the numbers of falling and fallen hou&s;es, it appears as though it had been lately &s;acked, and looks like a great capital, in ruins. The marks of grape-&s;hot, and cannon, are di&s;cernible on its walls, from the fury of <HI>Charles</HI> XII. who be&s;eiged it, and cau&s;ed great deva&s;tation at the com|mencement of the pre&s;ent century: but it has &s;uffered &s;till more by the repeated &s;ieges it has undergone, when alternately in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ru&s;&s;ians and confede|rates. It is &s;urrounded with high brick walls, fortified with round and &s;quare towers, after the old manner of fortification. The &s;treets are broad and hand&s;ome; but almo&s;t every hou&s;e wears the appearance of ruined gran|deur; yet the churches have retained their original &s;plen|dor. This city is famous for a univer&s;ity, founded and endowed by <HI>Ca&s;&s;imer</HI> the Great, and fini&s;hed about the year 1401, and improved and completed by <HI>Ladi&s;laus Iaghellon.</HI></P>
<P>The cathedral is a noble building, and is dedicated to St. <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> formerly bi&s;hop of the &s;ee, whom <HI>Boli&s;laus</HI> II. killed at the altar with his own hands, becau&s;e the good bi&s;hop's admonitions were grown in&s;upportable to him. The remains of St. <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> are inclo&s;ed in a &s;il|ver
<PB N="146" REF="151">
&s;hrine; and ma&s;&s;es are continually performed, day and night, in this church. In the trea&s;ury of the cathedral, among other things of great value, the regalia, namely the crown and &s;cepter, are depo&s;ited; and, on this occa|&s;ion, the trea&s;urer of the kingdom has the care of it. The kings of Poland are always crowned, and their remains are interred, in this church.</P>
<P>Toward the &s;outhern part of the town, near the Vi&s;tula, ri&s;es a &s;mall eminence, upon who&s;e top is a palace, &s;urrounded with brick-walls, and old towers, which form a kind of citadel to the town. It was founded by <HI>Ladi&s;laus Jaghellon;</HI> the greate&s;t part of it was demoli&s;hed by <HI>Charles</HI> the XII, in 1702, when he entered the town in triumph, after the battle of Cli&s;&s;ow. There are &s;ome remains of the old &s;tructure, con&s;i&s;ting of a few apartments which remain in the &s;tate they exi&s;ted in the la&s;t century. The walls of the apartments are painted with tilts and tournaments, and &s;ome repre&s;ent the coronations of the kings of Poland, others are painted with grote&s;que &s;hapes, and carved heads of extraordinary appearances. They are all of large dimen&s;ions, and &s;hew the remains of an|cient magnificence, but are intirely without furniture. Since the year 1300, the laws of Poland have ex|pre&s;sly enjoined, that Cracow &s;hould be the place of coronation, and &s;uch has been the &s;uper&s;titious attach|ment, of the Poles, to this cu&s;tom, that when <HI>John S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lie&s;ky,</HI> was de&s;irous of being crowned at Leopold,
<PB N="147" REF="152">
on account of its vicinity to the army, which he was to command, again&s;t the Turks, at the time of his election, the Poli&s;h patriots &s;trongly oppo&s;ed any in|novation, and he was obliged to repair to Cracow for the performance of the ceremony. Since <HI>Ladi&s;laus</HI> all the &s;ucceeding Kings, except the pre&s;ent, have been con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ciated at Cracow. It has often been con&s;umed by fire, and was once vi&s;ited by the plague, in 1707 and 1708, which &s;wept away &s;everal thou&s;ands of the inhabit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nts. The city is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been founded by a Poli&s;h or Bohemian prince, of the name of <HI>Cracus,</HI> in the year of Chri&s;t 700, from whom it takes its name; here is likewi&s;e the burial place of <HI>Cracus.</HI> Not far from the city, is another, of his daughter <HI>Venda,</HI> who, it is &s;aid, drowned her&s;elf in the Vi&s;tula, that &s;he might not be compelled to marry a per&s;on, for whom &s;he had entertained an aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es in Poland con&s;i&s;t chiefly of ground-floors, for they &s;eldom live up &s;tairs, neither are their buildings united, but the dwelling hou&s;e is over again&s;t the gate, the kitchen and offices on one &s;ide, a round or &s;quare court, and the &s;tables, on the other, which are all generally built of wood. Some there are who affect to imitate the Italians, and build much higher with &s;tone or brick; and, &s;ome of their towns are very regularly built, and are three or four &s;tories high. The rooms are u&s;ually hung with tape&s;try, and the re&s;t of the furniture is proportionably rich,
<PB N="148" REF="153">
except where they are liable to the incur&s;ions of the Tartars, and there they keep as little furniture as po&s;&s;ible. The hou&s;es of the pea&s;ants are no better than huts, built with poles, in a round form, and open on the top, to let out the &s;moke; they are covered with boards, or thatch; and, as they &s;eldom con&s;i&s;t of more than one room, the people and their cattle &s;leep together.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the People, their Cu&s;toms, Manners, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Poles, in their per&s;ons, make a noble appear|ance, and are rather tall than &s;hort; their com|plexions fair, and their hair u&s;ually of a pale yellow; their deportment is &s;tately, and their countenance of a &s;erious a&s;pect; they po&s;&s;e&s;s great corporal &s;trength, and are long lived. In their features, and general appear|ance, they re&s;emble A&s;iatics rather than Europeans, and are certainly de&s;cended from Tartar ance&s;ters. It has been remarked, that the &s;ingular manner in which they

<PB REF="154">
<HEAD>POLES</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="149" REF="155">
wear their hair, is the mo&s;t ancient token of their ori|gin; for, &s;o early as the fifth century, &s;ome nations, who were comprehended under the name of Sythians, had the &s;ame cu&s;tom; for, at the court of Attila, a Scythian lord is de&s;cribed, who&s;e head was &s;haved in a circular form; which perfectly agrees with the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion in Poland. The dre&s;s of the Poles is rather &s;ingular, but elegant; they wear a ve&s;t, which reaches down to the middle of the leg; and a kind of gown over it, lined with furs, and girded with a &s;a&s;h, with &s;lieves clo&s;e to the arm, like a wai&s;tcoat; al&s;o a fur cap; and their &s;hirts are without collar or wri&s;tbands: they have neither &s;tock, nor neckcloth; their breeches make but one piece with their &s;tockings; and, in&s;tead of &s;hoes, Turkey leather boots are in u&s;e, with their &s;oles, and deep iron heels, bent like a half-moon. They bear a &s;abre and pole-axe, never putting them off, but when they go to bed. The &s;abre hangs by a leathern &s;trap, with their handerchief, knife, and &s;heath, and a &s;mall &s;tone, &s;et in &s;ilver, to whet the knife on. When on hor&s;eback, which is very fre|quent (for a Pole cannot &s;tir a mile without his hor&s;e), they wear over all a &s;hort cloak, which is commonly covered with furs, both within and without. The better &s;ort of people wear &s;ables; and others, the &s;kins of tygers, leopards, &amp;c. The pea&s;ants u&s;ually clothe them&s;elves with a &s;heep-&s;kin, with the wool on, in winter; and in &s;ummer, a thick, coar&s;e cloth; and make bu&s;kins and &s;hoes of the bark of trees: their &s;hirts are of a thick
<PB N="150" REF="156">
linen, and they wear drawers. The habit of the women is &s;imilar to that of the men; but the fa&s;hion of both &s;exes has, of late years, very much imitated the French and Engli&s;h modes. The women of the lower cla&s;s wear on their heads a wrapper of white linen, under which their hair is braided, and hangs down in two plaits; &s;everal of them have a long piece of white linen, hanging by the &s;ide of their faces, and covering their bodies below their knees, which gives them the appearance of doing penance. The dre&s;s of the ladies is a &s;imple Pol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nai&s;e, or long robe, edged with fur.</P>
<P>The common food of Poland, is beef or veal; mutton is not in much e&s;teem; veni&s;on, wild-fowl, and river fi&s;h, they have in great plenty, but no &s;ea-fi&s;h. They eat but little bread, though there is &s;uch a quantity of corn, preferring roots, which they dre&s;s various ways: &s;oup and broth they do not regard, neither are they &s;end of roa&s;ting their meat too much; in their, &s;auces they u&s;e a great deal of &s;affron, and &s;pices, and &s;ea&s;on their di&s;hes very high. They are immoderate lovers of bacon. Peas are re&s;erved for the better rank of people: they are as fond of mu&s;hrooms as the Mu&s;covites, and pickle their cabbage, and pre&s;erve it all the year round. Their u&s;ual drink is beer, which in &s;ome parts, is made only of malt, but in others of ground wheat. In Lithuania, and many provinces of Poland, they have mead, or methe&s;lin; and, at War|&s;aw,
<PB N="151" REF="157">
they frequently mix the juice of cherries, black|berries &amp;c. with their honey, and give it different names. But, be&s;ides the product of the country, beer and mead, they have great quantities of wine, imported from Hungary, France, Spain, Italy and Germany&punc; That of Hungary exceeds the Spani&s;h in &s;trength; and, is brought over the Carpathian mountains, in large ca&s;ks, drawn upon carriages by oxen, which renders it very dear, the be&s;t being &s;old for twenty &s;hillings the Poli&s;h pot, which is three quarts. The Italian wines likewi&s;e come by land, but are not &s;o much drank as the re&s;t. The French and Rheni&s;h wines come by way of the Baltic, to Dantzick, and are much weaker than the others. All their &s;trong waters and &s;pirits are extracted from wheat, barley, oats, cyder, &amp;c. They are drank by the common people; though &s;ometimes, in winter, the higher cla&s;s u&s;e them, when rendered palatable with anni&s;eed, cinnamon, and other &s;pices. Their liquors are all, in general, very &s;trong, and well &s;uited to their hardy manner of living.</P>
<P>The Poles are an animated people, and are, for the mo&s;t part, open-hearted and hone&s;t; more prone to be deceived, than capable of deceit; and not &s;o ea&s;ily provoked, as appea&s;ed; courteous, affable, and mo&s;t ho&s;pitable to &s;trangers; of great &s;pirit, and exceed all other nations in vivacity. They u&s;e much

action in ordinary conver&s;ation, apply them&s;elves early to learning; but, having acquired a complete knowledge of the Latin language, neglect to &s;tudy more. The women &s;peak Latin fluently, and it is &s;aid, they learn it in their nunneries. The nobility and gentry are fond of arms, and po&s;&s;e&s;s a pa&s;&s;ion for travelling, endeavouring to qualify them&s;elves for employments in church and &s;tate; they leave the care of trade and hu&s;bandry to common people; and are, in general, &s;o innured to hard&s;hips, that the Germans are deemed an effeminate race, in compari&s;on of them. Their armies have been often been known to lie abroad in the &s;now, all the win|ter, and, if they were well di&s;ciplined, their troops would be invincible.</P>
<P>Both men and women are fond of parade and extravagance; and in nothing do they evince their di&s;po&s;ition for magnificence, more than in the mul|titudes of their &s;ervants, hor&s;es, and arms. A Po|li&s;h gentleman dre&s;&s;es his &s;ervant equal with him|&s;elf, pre&s;ently reduces his e&s;tate, to keep up the idle ceremonies of his e&s;tabli&s;hment. He him&s;elf has often forty different &s;uits of clothes, the riche&s;t imaginable, but the&s;e are handed down from father to &s;on. The nobles, and chief gentry, have all their hor&s;e and foot guards, which attend, night and day, at their gates and hou&s;es. The&s;e go before their ma&s;ter's coach in the &s;treets, and they never
<PB N="153" REF="159">
appear in greater pomp, than when at the general diet, or a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates. Their numbers vary, from four hundred to a thou&s;and; and they e&s;teem them&s;elves &s;u|perior to German princes; e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the &s;enate, who indeed want little to di&s;tingui&s;h them from &s;overeigns, in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, but the privilege of coining money. At their meals, trumpets, and mu&s;ic, play; and a great number of gentlemen wait on them at table. It is u&s;ual for a nobleman to give meat to his &s;ervant, as he waits behind him, which he receives, and eats &s;tanding; &s;erving his ma&s;ter with the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect, with wine, or whatever he may call for. This circum&s;tance will appear le&s;s &s;trange, when we con&s;ider, that many of the inferior nobility &s;ubmit to enter into the &s;ervice of the &s;uperior: which, in Poland, is con&s;idered as no di&s;grace; for, in general, they are treated liberally, &s;uffered to eat at the &s;ame table, and have a pea&s;ant-boy to wait on them, But, &s;hould any of the&s;e gentlemen-&s;ervants neglect their duty, they are whipped naked, with little regard to their quality. Even this puni&s;hment is not con&s;idered as di&s;|graceful, nor any &s;ituation they may be &s;ubject to, pro|vided they never apply them&s;elves to trade or hu&s;bandry, either employment being deemed infamous for a Poli&s;h gentleman.</P>
<P>The ladies of the Poli&s;h grandees often carry their ex|travagance to a pitch of refinement truly ridiculous. It is not unu&s;ual to &s;ee one of the&s;e ladies attended in her. train of &s;ervants and coach with &s;ix hor&s;es, by an old gen|tleman-u&s;her,
<PB N="154" REF="160">
a governante, and a dwarf, of each &s;ex, to bear a train: and, if it be night, &s;he is &s;urrounded with flambeaux. Her equipage the reader will have an idea of, if he figures to him&s;elf every thing that is &s;hewy in life; every thing that is magnificent, ceremonious, and expen&s;ive. Pomp, in general, is limited only by the ex|tent of the e&s;tate; though that, not unfrequently, falls a victim to the vanity of its owner; who, being forbidden by the rules of honour, to enrich him&s;elf by trade, is re|duced to perfect beggary, or obliged to enter into the &s;er|vice of the nobles.</P>
<P>The mode of &s;alutation among the Poles, is, by inclin|ing their heads, and &s;triking their brea&s;ts with one of their hands, while they &s;tretch the other towards the ground: but, when a common per&s;on meets a &s;uperior, he bows his head almo&s;t to the earth, waving, at the &s;ame time, his hand, with which he touches the bottom of the leg, near the feet of the per&s;on to whom he pays his obei&s;ance Men of all ranks generally wear whi&s;kers, and &s;have their heads, leaving only a circle of hair upon the crown.</P>
<P>They are fond of &s;ociety, and entertain in the mo&s;t friendly manner; they find neither &s;poons, knives, or forks, but every per&s;on brings his own. The moment their gue&s;ts enter the hou&s;e, the gates are immediately &s;hut, nor are &s;uffered to be opened, until the company depart. Every man of di&s;tinction &s;ets his hall apart, for the purpo&s;e of entertainment; in which is a place, railed
<PB N="155" REF="161">
in, where an immen&s;e quantity of plate is &s;hewn; and over it a gallery for mu&s;ic, which con&s;i&s;ts of an organ, violins, &amp;c. Tho&s;e who are invited, bring their &s;ervants with them; and, although there is always a profu&s;ion of every delicacy, there is very little returned to the family; but the gentleman's &s;ervants &s;eize what is left, and they have a napkin, on purpo&s;e to carry off the &s;weet-meats for their ladies. After the cloth is removed, the gentlemen u&s;ually &s;it, and drink a great while, and &s;moke tobacco, when the ladies retire. The women are always admitted to their fea&s;ts, and drink wine in bumpers, which is cu&s;|tomary with the Poles; nor will they ea&s;ily excu&s;e the gentlemen from pledging them.</P>
<P>As a proof of the magnificence and elegance of the Po|li&s;h entertainments, we &s;hall add an account of a <HI>f&ecirc;te cham|p&ecirc;tre,</HI> as de&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> and given by the prince&s;s <HI>Zartori&s;ki,</HI> to lord <HI>Herbert.</HI></P>
<P>Povon&s;ki, the villa of prince <HI>Adam Zartori&s;ki,</HI> is about three miles from War&s;aw, in the mid&s;t of a fore&s;t. The &s;ituation is almo&s;t level, with here and there a gentle &s;lope, which produces an agreeable variety. A river runs through the grounds, which are laid out in the En|gli&s;h ta&s;te, with a beautiful intermixture of lawn and wood; walks are cut through the wood, and carried along the &s;ide of the water. The hou&s;e, which &s;tands upon a gentle ri&s;e, has the appearance of a cottage, con|&s;tructed, like tho&s;e of the pea&s;ants, with trunks of trees piled upon each other, and thatched with &s;traw. Be&s;ides

the principal building, inhabited by the prince and prin|ce&s;s, there are &s;eparate cottages for the children and atten|dants, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch of which has its inclo&s;ures, and a &s;mall garden. This group of &s;tructures bears the re&s;emblance of a vil|lage, compo&s;ed of huts, &s;cattered at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other. Other buildings, &s;uch as &s;ummer-hou&s;es, pavillions, ru&s;tic &s;heds, and ruins, are di&s;per&s;ed through|out the grounds. The &s;tables are con&s;tructed in the form of a half-demoli&s;hed amphitheatre. Several romantic bridges, rudely compo&s;ed of trunks, and bent branches of trees, contribute to heigthen the ru&s;ticity of the &s;ce|nery.</P>
<P>Upon our arrival, we repaired to the principal cottage, where the prince&s;s was, ready to receive us. We ex|pected the in&s;ide to be furni&s;hed in the &s;imple &s;tyle of a pea&s;ant's hovel; but, were &s;urpri&s;ed to find every &s;pecies of elegant magnificence, which riches and ta&s;te could collect. All the apartments are decorated in the mo&s;t co&s;tly manner; but the &s;plendour of the bath-room was peculiarly &s;triking. The &s;ides are covered, from top to bottom, with &s;mall &s;quare pieces of Dre&s;den china, each ornamented with a &s;prig; and the border and cieling are painted with beautiful fe&s;toons. The expence of fitting up this apartment mu&s;t have been prodigious; as I was informed there were at lea&s;t three thou&s;and &s;quare pieces of china u&s;ed, each of which co&s;t, at Dre&s;den, three du|cats, or 1l. 7s. 6d.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="163">After having &s;urveyed all the apartments, we proceeded to an inclo&s;ure near the hou&s;e, &s;urrounded with large blocks of granite, heaped one upon another; and fallen trees, placed in the mo&s;t natural and picture&s;que &s;hapes. Here we drank tea, upon the lawn. From thence we repaired to the &s;everal cottages inhabited by the children; which are fitted up in different &s;tyles, but with equal elegance. Every thing without doors conveyed an idea of a happy pea&s;ant's family; and all within, was co&s;tline&s;s and &s;tate. Such a contra&s;t of &s;implicity and magnificence can hardly be conceived. We next walked round the grounds, which are elegantly laid out, in our ta&s;te of gardening. The company then all adjourned to a Turk|i&s;h tent, of rich and curious workman&s;hip, pitched in a beautiful retired field, near the &s;tables, which repre&s;ent a ruined amphitheatre. This tent belonged to the grand vizier, and was taken during the late war between the Ru&s;&s;ians and the Turks: under it, was a &s;ettee, and a carpet, &s;pread upon the ground. Here we &s;taid, con|ver&s;ing, until it was quite dark, when the prince&s;s pro|po&s;ed returning. She led us, through the hou&s;e, to a &s;mall &s;pot of ri&s;ing ground, where we were &s;uddenly &s;truck with a mo&s;t beautiful illumination. A ru&s;tic bridge, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;ingle arch, over a broad piece of water, was &s;tudded with &s;everal thou&s;and lamps, of different co|lours; while the reflexion of this illuminated bridge, in the water, was &s;o &s;trong, as to deceive the eye, and give the whole the appearance of a brilliant circle, &s;u&s;pended in the air. The effect was &s;plendid, beyond de&s;cription; and
<PB N="158" REF="164">
con&s;iderably heightened by the gloom of the fore&s;t in the back-ground. While we continued admiring this delight|ful &s;cene, a bank of mu&s;ic &s;truck up, at a little di&s;tance' and amu&s;ed us with an excellent concert.</P>
<P>We were then lead from this exchanting &s;pot, acro&s;s the illuminated bridge, to a thatched pavillion, opened at the &s;ides, and &s;upported by pillars, ornamented by gar|lands, and twi&s;ted fe&s;toons of flowers. We found within, a cold collation, and &s;at down to a table, covered with all kinds of delicacies, with the mo&s;t co&s;tly wines, and every &s;pecies of fruit, which art or nature could furni&s;h. The evening was delightful, the &s;cenery picture&s;que, the fare delicious, the company in good &s;pirits; for, who could be otherwi&s;e, when every circum&s;tance which the ta&s;te and ingenuity of our fair ho&s;te&s;s could invent, con&s;pired to heighten the entertainment? The collation being ended, we ro&s;e from table, which I concluded to be the clo&s;e of the entertainment, but was agreeably di&s;appointed. The gardens were &s;uddenly illuminated: we all ranged about, as fancy dictated; and were gratified by the &s;ound of wind in&s;truments, played by per&s;ons di&s;per&s;ed in dif|ferent parts of the grounds. We repa&s;&s;ed the bridge, and returned into the cottage; when the two elde&s;t daughters of the prince&s;s, who were dre&s;&s;ed in Grecian dre&s;&s;es, of the mo&s;t elegant &s;implicity, performed a Poli&s;h and a Co&s;&s;ac dance; the former, &s;erious and graceful; the latter, comic and lively. The elde&s;t &s;on, a boy about eight years old, next performed a hornpipe, with wonderful
<PB N="159" REF="165">
agility; and afterwards a dance, in the &s;tyle of the Poli&s;h pea&s;ants, with much humour. It was now pa&s;t two in the morning. We &s;eemed as if we could &s;tay for ever: but, as there mu&s;t be an end of all &s;ublunary joys, we took our leave, expre&s;&s;ing our thanks and gratitude, in language far unequal to our feelings. I can &s;carce form to my&s;elf a f&ecirc;te champ&ecirc;tre &s;o elegant; and I am &s;atisfied, it will &s;eldom fall to the lot of the &s;ame per&s;on, to partake of &s;uch a plea&s;ing entertainment, twice in his life.</P>
<P>The amu&s;ements and exerci&s;es of the Poles contribute much to their health, their diver&s;ions being warlike and manly. Hunting, and feats of hor&s;eman&s;hip, they value them&s;elves greatly on. Leaping, vaulting, and jump|ing, is much in fa&s;hion; and dancing is a favourite amu&s;e|ment. Mu&s;ic has its charms with this people, and tends much to promote the natural vivacity of their di&s;po&s;itions and conver&s;ation, in which they excel, and are extremely fond of it.</P>
<P>The Poli&s;h noblemen are a&s;&s;iduous to amu&s;e; and it is con&s;idered e&s;&s;ential in the etiquette of ho&s;pitality, to in|vent whatever may be novel, or will tend to the &s;atisfaction of their gue&s;ts. In their endeavours (and indeed in their hou&s;es, decorations, and furniture), they happily blend the Engli&s;h and French modes. Their genero&s;ity is in|timately connected with their politene&s;s; and, as they &s;pare no expence, and have naturally a good ta&s;te, they always &s;ucceed in creating plea&s;ure and &s;urprize.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="166">The Poli&s;h gentlemen generally travel on hor&s;eback; but, the country being open, and but few hills, a cala&s;h, and pair of hor&s;es, is very much u&s;ed on a journey. The pea&s;ants have little wooden waggons, tilted, with a kind of ba&s;ket work; and their wheels, all of a piece, without &s;pokes. Travellers &s;eldom meet with any thing to eat in the country inns in Poland, but are obliged to buy provi&s;ions in the towns, and carry them with their bag|gage. This inconveniency is &s;omewhat obviated, in the per&s;ons of foreigners, who, if they want a &s;upply, &s;end to the lord of the village, who furni&s;hes them with every nece&s;&s;ary. Their inns are but few, and tho&s;e very mi&s;e|rable, the inn-keepers chu&s;ing not to provide more than &s;ufficient for their own family; owing to the want of ho|ne&s;ty in the natives, when they travel; finding, from ex|perience, that their gue&s;ts are &s;eldom in the mind to make any returns for their entertainment. The inns have boarded booths, at the end of which are little rooms, with a fire-place, but without furniture, where the traveller may &s;leep, if he plea&s;es; but the fleas, and other ver|min, will &s;o di&s;turb him, that he had better retire, and contentedly repo&s;e with his cattle.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing through fore&s;ts, the traveller frequently ob|&s;erves the traces of former inclo&s;ures, and &s;ometimes, even the ve&s;tiges of paved &s;treets are di&s;cernible. He is often impeded by waters, who&s;e bridges are kept but in ill re|pair; and it is nece&s;&s;ary to be very careful in pa&s;&s;ing them; and, in winter, a &s;ledge mu&s;t be procured, for the coach,
<PB N="161" REF="167">
or cala&s;h, to pa&s;s over the ice. The cold is extreme in the northern parts of the country; for which rea&s;on, it is nece&s;&s;ary to provide coats, lined with fur, and ca&s;es, to put the feet in, when riding in a cala&s;h. Hor&s;emen line their boots, and &s;eldom travel without a cordial dram. The hor&s;e is &s;ometimes in danger of being frozen; again&s;t which, they u&s;e the &s;ame remedy as the Ru&s;&s;ians, by rubbing it with &s;now.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Coxe</HI> thus &s;peaks of the roads, and of the incon|venience of travelling; "I never &s;aw a road &s;o barren of intere&s;ting &s;cenes, as that from Cracow to War&s;aw; there is not a &s;ingle object throughout the whole tract, which can, for a moment, draw the attention of the mo&s;t inqui|&s;itive traveller. The country, for the mo&s;t part, is level, with little variation of &s;urface; and is chiefly over&s;pread with va&s;t tracts of thick, gloomy fore&s;ts; and, even where the country was more open, the di&s;tant horizon was always &s;kirted with wood. The trees were mo&s;tly pines and firs, intermixed with beech, birch, and &s;mall oaks. The occa|&s;ional breaks in the fore&s;t pre&s;ented &s;ome pa&s;ture-ground, and here and there a few meagre crops of corn."</P>
<P>"Without having actually traver&s;ed it, I could hardly have conceived &s;o comfortle&s;s a region. A forlorn &s;til|ne&s;s and &s;olitude prevailed almo&s;t throughout the whole extent, with few &s;ymptoms of an inhabited, and &s;till le&s;s, of a civilized country. Though in the high road which unites Cracow to War&s;aw, in the cour&s;e of about 258
<PB N="162" REF="168">
Engli&s;h miles, we met, in our progre&s;s, only two car|riages, and about a dozen carts. The country was equally thin of human inhabitants: a few &s;traggling villages, all built of wood, &s;ucceeded one another, at long intervals, who&s;e mi&s;erable appearance corre&s;ponded to the wretch|edne&s;s of the country around them. In the&s;e a&s;&s;emblages of huts, the only places of reception for travellers, were hovels, belonging to Jews, totally de&s;titute of furniture, and every &s;pecies of accommodation."</P>
<P>"We could &s;eldom procure any other room but that in which the family lived. In the article of provi&s;ion, eggs and milk were our greate&s;t luxuries, and could not always be obtained. Our only bed, was &s;traw, thrown upon the ground; and we thought our&s;elves happy, if we could get it clean. Even we, who were by no means delicate, and who had long been accu&s;tomed to put up with all inconveniencies, found our&s;elves di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in this land of de&s;olation. Though, in mo&s;t countries, we made a point to &s;u&s;pend our journey during night, in order that no &s;cene might e&s;cape our ob&s;ervation, yet, we here preferred con|tinuing our rout, without intermi&s;&s;ion, to the penance we endured in the receptacles of penury and filth; and we have rea&s;on to believe, the darkne&s;s of the night deprived us of nothing, but the &s;ight of gloomy fore&s;ts, indifferent crops of corn, and objects of human mi&s;ery. The road bore as few marks of indu&s;try as the country it inter&s;ects. It was be&s;t where it was &s;andy: in other parts, it was &s;carce pa&s;&s;able; and, in the mar&s;hy grounds, where
<PB N="163" REF="169">
&s;ome labour was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make it &s;upport the carriages, it was rai&s;ed with &s;ticks, and boughs of trees, thrown promi&s;cuou&s;ly on the &s;urface, or formed by trunks of trees, laid cro&s;s-ways."</P>
<P>In the marriage ceremonies, or burials of the Poles, there is little that requires a particular de&s;cription, but it is ob&s;ervable, that they celebrate them with va&s;t pomp and expence; and it is cu&s;tomary, for all at the wedding, to contribute to the portion of the bride, by giving pre&s;ent, which are often very mag|nificent. By the laws of Poland, the e&s;tate of the father, is equally divided among his children, except any of them go into a mona&s;tery, and then their portion is divided among the re&s;t; the younger children as in other Popi&s;h countries, are encouraged by their parents to take the vow upon them, that their e&s;tates may be pre&s;erved entire for the elde&s;t &s;on, which would otherwi&s;e dwindle away to nothing, where there happens to be a numerous i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;es of the poles are very few; that of the <HI>Plica,</HI> is the mo&s;t painful; and is &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from an acrid vi&s;cous humour, penetrating into the hair, which is tubular; it then exudes either from its &s;ides or extremities, and clots the whole to|gether, either in &s;eperate folds, or in one undi&s;tin|gui&s;hed ma&s;s. Its &s;ymptoms, more or le&s;s violent, according to the con&s;titution of the patient, or ma|lignity
<PB N="164" REF="170">
of the di&s;ea&s;e; are itchings, &s;wellings, eruptions, ulcers, intermitting fevers, pains in the head, langour, lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, rheumati&s;m, gout, and &s;ometimes with convul&s;ions, pal&s;y, and madne&s;s. The&s;e &s;ymp|toms gradually decrea&s;e as the hair becomes affected, if the patient is &s;haved on the head, he relap&s;es into all the dreadful complaints, which preceded the eruption of the plica, and he continues to labour under them until a fre&s;h growth of hair, ab&s;orbs the ancient humour. This di&s;order is deemed hereditary, and is proved to be contagious, when in a virulent &s;tate. Many phy&s;ical cau&s;es, have been &s;uppo&s;ed, to render the plica, more frequent in the&s;e regions, than in any other parts; and, it would be endle&s;s to enu|merate the various conjectures with which each per|&s;on has &s;upported his favourite hypothe&s;is. But, the mo&s;t probable, are tho&s;e a&s;&s;igned to Dr. <HI>Vicat.</HI> The fir&s;t cau&s;e is the nature of the Poli&s;h air, which is rendered in&s;alubrious, by numerous woods and mora&s;&s;es, and occa&s;ionally derives an uncommon keen|ne&s;s, even in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, from the po&s;i|tion of the Carpathian mountains; for the &s;outhern and &s;outh ea&s;terly winds, which u&s;ually convey warmth in other regions, are in this chilled in their pa&s;&s;age over their &s;nowy &s;ummits. The &s;econd is unwhole|&s;ome water; for although Poland is not deficient in good &s;prings, yet the common people u&s;ually drink that which is neare&s;t at hand, taken indi&s;criminately from rivers, lakes, and even &s;tanding pools. The
<PB N="165" REF="171">
third cau&s;e is the inattention of the natives to clean|line&s;s; for experience &s;hews, that tho&s;e who are not negligent in their per&s;ons, and habitations, are le&s;s liable to be afflicted with the <HI>Plica,</HI> than others who are deficient in that particular. In a word, the <HI>Plica Polonica,</HI> appears to be a contagious di&s;temper, which like the lepro&s;y, &s;till prevails among a people ignorant in medicine, and inattentive to check its progre&s;s; but it is very rarely known in tho&s;e countries where proper precautions are taken to prevent it &s;preading.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of their Trade, Manufactures, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few manufacturers in Poland, and the commodities of the country, are for the mo&s;t part exported, unwrought, out of the kingdom. Religious zeal, or rather bigotry, has greatly injured the trade, and commerce of Poland; but &s;o late as the year 1776, manufactures have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, which &s;eem to pro|mi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s, under the patronag, of the pre&s;ent amia|ble monarch. The&s;e manufactures, employ 3000 per|&s;ons,
<PB N="166" REF="172">
including tho&s;e di&s;per&s;ed in the contiguous villages, who &s;pin linen, and wor&s;ted thread. Here are twenty foreigners, who direct, the different branches; the re&s;t are natives, belonging to the King's deme&s;nes. The ap|prentices are boys and girls, all children of the Poli&s;h pea|&s;ants, who are clothed and fed, and have be&s;ides a &s;mall allowance in money. The directors, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> <Q>complain of their having no emulation among them, and that, although, they are better fed, and cloathed, than the other pea&s;ants, yet, they cannot excite them to indu&s;try, by any other means than force.</Q> Nor is this a matter of wonder; for as they &s;till continue in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, if they acquire any unu&s;ual profit, and carry it to their parents, they are apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t it &s;hould be taken away; it having frequently happened, that any lit|tle pittance, they had gained by their labour, has been wre&s;ted from, in order to pay the quit-rents, which their parents owed to their lords. One of the apprentices, more &s;hrewd than than the re&s;t, &s;aid to the director, who was trying to &s;timulate her indu&s;try, <Q>What advantage &s;hall I attain, if I follow your advice! Let me become ever &s;o &s;killful in my trade, I &s;hall always continue &s;ub|ject to my ma&s;ter: the labour, will be mine, the profit his.</Q>&mdash;To which ob&s;ervation, no reply could be given. Mo&s;t of them, adds Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> appeared with a &s;ettled me|lancholy in their countenances, as made my heart ach to &s;ee them; and, it was ea&s;y to perceive, they worked from compul&s;ion, and not from inclination.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="173">As &s;ome remedy for this evil, it has been propo&s;ed, after a certain time of years, to give liberty to tho&s;e, who particularly excel and di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, by any ex|traordinary exertions. But this humane propo&s;al, has been rejected; from a notion, that &s;uch per&s;ons, when once made free, would do longer continue to work: and that by the&s;e means, the manufactures would be deprived of their be&s;t hands. Though this inconvenience, however, might occa&s;ionally take place, yet the encouragement of &s;uch a regulation, would beget alacrity, and excite indu&s;try, and would therefore create a greater number of arti&s;ts, than it would emancipate. It would now and then occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of a manufacturer; but, it would diffu&s;e &s;uch a know|ledge of the manufacture, as to render the lo&s;s immate|rial.</P>
<P>The manufactures are &s;till in their infancy, but their in&s;titution reflects con&s;iderable lu&s;tre, upon his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's reign; and more particularly, as his attention was not withdrawn from them, during the civil commo|tions, which &s;o lately &s;hook his throne.</P>
<P>The manufactures are chiefly of linen, leather, hard|ware, and earthen-ware; and the&s;e are far from being im|proved as they might be, the better &s;ort of people, look|ing upon every thing that relates to trade, or mechanic employments, as beneath their care; and the lower cla&s;s,
<PB N="168" REF="174">
being va&s;&s;als to the re&s;t, have neither time, nor &s;tock to make any con&s;iderable improvement.</P>
<P>The language of the Poles, is the <HI>Sclavonian,</HI> but there are &s;o many different dialects of it, &s;poken in the different provinces of this kingdom, that one part of the people &s;carce under&s;tand the other. They all, however, agree in multiplying con&s;onants, and if they did not &s;ound more vowels when they &s;peak, than are contained in the words they write, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to utter them. The Latin is as univer&s;ally &s;poken, as the Scla|vonian, there being a &s;chool in every village, for the teach|ing it, and the girls learn it in their nunneries: it is &s;poken even by the the lower cla&s;s of people, but without any re|gard to accent, quantity, or purity of language. From the time of King <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> I. to the reign of <HI>Wladi&s;laus</HI> IV. was the interval, when arts and &s;ciences flouri&s;hed mo&s;t in Poland. Since that aera, the Poli&s;h mu&s;e, &s;eems to have drooped and langui&s;hed. However, they now begin to revive, for at pre&s;ent, the purity and elegance of the Poli&s;h and Latin languages are &s;tudied, the new philo&s;ophy is introduced, the mathematics are taught, and natural philo&s;ophy flouri&s;hes; the learned in this country, al&s;o apply them&s;elves, to the &s;tudy of Poli&s;h hi&s;tory, which they cultivate and improve, endeavouring to make the good writers, of former ages, better known, and u&s;eful to the pre&s;ent; this, and the valuable library of count <HI>Za|lu&s;ki,</HI> at War&s;aw, opens an ine&s;timable trea&s;ure of ancient authors. The Greek language begins to be &s;tudied in
<PB N="169" REF="175">
Poland, and literary corre&s;pondences are carried on with learned foreigners. It is true, the pre&s;s has not produced &s;o many books in Poland, as in other countries; but this may be imputed in a great mea&s;ure, to a want of able pub|li&s;hers, liberal patrons of learning, and well regulated print|ing-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>There are two univer&s;ities, one at Cracow, and the other at Vilna; the former, was under the direction of prie&s;ts, called academicians; and the latter, &s;uperintended by the Je&s;uits: but in both, the cour&s;e of &s;tudy, was chiefly confined to Theology. Since the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Je&s;uits, the King has e&s;tabli&s;hed a committee of education, compo&s;ed of members di&s;tingui&s;hed either by high &s;tation, or enlightened under&s;tandings. This committee has an ab&s;olute power, in matters of education; appoints pro|fe&s;&s;ors, regulates their &s;alaries, and directs their &s;tudies. The advantages of this regulation, have already been ex|perienced. The univer&s;ity of Cracow, has been called the mother of Poli&s;h literature, principally &s;upplying all the other &s;eminaries with profe&s;&s;ors, and learned men; but the removal of the royal re&s;idence to War&s;aw, together, with its civil and inte&s;tine commotions, have greatly ob&s;cured its lu&s;tre. Its mo&s;t flouri&s;hing period, was under <HI>Sigi&s;|mund Augu&s;tus,</HI> in the &s;ixteenth century, when &s;everal German reformi&s;ts fled from the per&s;ecutions of the Em|peror <HI>Charles</HI> V. and took refuge in this city. The&s;e reformi&s;ts gave ver&s;ions of &s;ome of the &s;acred writings, and other theological publications, which &s;pread the re|formed
<PB N="170" REF="176">
religion, over great part of Poland. The protec|tion afforded by <HI>Sigi&s;mund Augu&s;tus</HI> to men of learning of all denominations, and the univer&s;al toleration, to every &s;ect of chri&s;tians, created a &s;u&s;picion, that he was inclined to the new church, had publickly renounced the catholic faith, and avowed the reformed religion.</P>
<P>Although, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> from the nature of the go|vernment, learning has never been widely diffu&s;ed in Po|land; yet, there never have been wanting men of genius and literature, who have been an ornament to their coun|try; and perhaps, no nation can boa&s;t a more regular &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of excellent hi&s;torians, or a greater variety of wri|ters, deeply conver&s;ant, in the laws, &s;tatutes, and con&s;titu|tion. Under <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> I. and his &s;on <HI>Sigi&s;mund Augu&s;tus,</HI> the arts and &s;ciences began to be greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed by Royal patronage. They were cheri&s;hed by &s;ome of the &s;ucceeding monarchs, particularly <HI>John Sobie&s;ki;</HI> but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o prince has paid them more attention, than the pre&s;ent King, <HI>Stani&s;laus Augu&s;tus.</HI> His munificence, in this par|ticular, has been attended with the happie&s;t effects. The Poli&s;h literati, have within a few years, given to the pub|lic, a much greater variety of elegant compo&s;itions, than ever appeared in any former period of the &s;ame length. What is more material, a ta&s;te for &s;cience, has &s;pread it&s;elf among the nobles, and begins to be regarded as an ac|compli&s;hment. The enlargement of mind, derived from the licentious &s;pirit of the nobles, from this new pur&s;uit, has already weaned &s;everal of them, from their habits of
<PB N="171" REF="177">
barbarous turbulence, and greatly civilized their civil de|portment. It may in time teach them, thoroughly to comprehend the true intere&s;t of their country, and the expedience of due &s;ubordination, hitherto deemed incom|patible with liberty; the&s;e petty de&s;pots will, perhaps, be induced to lay a&s;ide, that contempt for their va&s;&s;als; they will perceive, that the burghers, and pea&s;ants, are the true &s;upports of their country: and that Poland, wants nothing but ju&s;tice, and order, to become as flouri&s;hing as the neighbouring &s;tates.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent King, &s;tudiou&s;ly encourages all attempts to refine and poli&s;h his native tongue; and for the promotion of learning, gives a dinner every thur&s;day to men of &s;cience and abilities; his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf pre&s;ides at table, and takes the lead in the graces of conver&s;ation, as much as in rank. The per&s;ons admitted to this &s;ociety, read occa&s;ionally, treati&s;es upon different topics of hi&s;tory, natural philo&s;ophy, and other mi&s;cellaneous &s;ubjects. Poe|try is likewi&s;e cultivated at the&s;e meetings.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion in Poland, is that of the Ro|man catholic; and few people po&s;&s;ibly are more zeaolus or bigotted in their way, which proceeds from the con&s;tant oppo&s;ition, and the provocations they meet with, from the Lutherans and Calvini&s;ts. There is a decree, that no per&s;on &s;hall be elected king of Poland, without fir&s;t ma|king a &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion of the orthodox Roman catholic religion; and that the queen mu&s;t either have been
<PB N="172" REF="178">
brought up in that communion, or publickly declare her&s;elf a member of it. Neither Arians, Socinians, or Anabapti&s;ts, are not tolerated in Poland. The prote&s;tants by virtue of the treaty &s;igned at Oliva, in the year 1735, &s;olicited and obtained, a free exerci&s;e of their religion; but a great num|ber of their churches have been taken from them, and de|moli&s;hed, and &s;uch open violation of the laws of ju&s;tice and equity, are of late become &s;o frequent, that the prote&s;tants at this time po&s;&s;e&s;s only twenty two churches in the cities and towns, and &s;ixty-five in the villages of Poland. The Greeks are equally oppre&s;&s;ed, with the prote&s;tants; whil&s;t the Jews are indulged with innumerable priviliges, and abound &s;o much, that the country is &s;tyled the <Q>Paradi&s;e of the Jews</Q>; it is &s;aid there are above two millions of Jews only in the villages of Poland. But to &s;hew how great is the &s;uperiority of the Popi&s;h religion, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the King is &s;tiled <HI>Orthodoxus,</HI> as a title of honour, that St. <HI>Floridan,</HI> and St. <HI>Adalbert</HI> are wor&s;hip|ped as the patron &s;aints of Poland, that the number of mona&s;teries in this kingdom, amounts to 176, and of nunneries to 117; be&s;ides two hundred and forty-&s;ix &s;e|minaries, and thirty-one abbeys, and la&s;tly, the clergy are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two thirds of the lands and revenues of the kingdom.</P>
<P>There are two archbi&s;hops, and fourteen bi&s;hops. The primate of Poland, is the archbi&s;hop of Gne&s;na, who &s;tiles him&s;elf <HI>the Pope's legate,</HI> borne, by virtue of a decree of the council of Lateran. His power is almo&s;t equal

to the King's, and has a golden cro&s;s carried before him. When he vi&s;its the King, the great chamberlain receives him at the &s;tairs foot, and the King comes into the anti-chamber to meet him. During a vacancy in the throne, he is <HI>Inter-rex.</HI></P>
<P>Neither the regular or &s;ecular clergy of Poland, are to be admired for their morals; though the people, as in all other Popi&s;h countries, give them abundance of re&s;pect; and, in mo&s;t of their courts of judicature, &s;ome of the judges are of the clergy. Pluralities are allowed, and the clergy, make no &s;cruple of living at a di&s;tance from their cures. The laity, on the contrary, are devout, and gene|rous in the benefactions, to their churches, and altars of the &s;aints; but are not very compa&s;&s;ionate towards the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed and poor, &s;uffering frequently their own &s;laves and menial &s;ervants, to peri&s;h for want of nece&s;&s;aries, and be|having to the&s;e unhappy wretches, as if they were of ano|ther &s;pecies. Sociniani&s;m has made a great progre&s;s in this kingdom, during the la&s;t century; and there have been acts of &s;tate, in &s;everal reigns, particularly in the la&s;t, for the extirpation of all people of that per&s;ua&s;ion; notwith|&s;tanding which, they &s;uffer Mahometani&s;m, and there are no le&s;s than 30,000 Tartars in Lithuania, who are allow|ed the free exerci&s;e of that religion. The Armenians, and others of the Greek church, have al&s;o, on the frontiers of Mu&s;covy, and Podolia, bi&s;hops, abbots, and prie&s;ts of their per&s;ua&s;ion, with the free exerci&s;e of their religion; and, all di&s;&s;idents, are permitted to have churches without

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of their Government, Revenues, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Poles, when con&s;idered as members of the com|munity, are either nobles, citizens, (in which cla&s;s merchants, arti&s;ts and mechanics, are included), or pea|&s;ants, who are mo&s;tly va&s;&s;als to the nobles. It is not ea&s;y to e&s;timate the number of inhabitants of Poland; but &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed the kingdom, together with Lithuania, to contain, 15,000,000, and when it is remembered that they have no colonies, have often enjoyed peace for many years, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing no fewer than 2,000,000, Jews, which are &s;aid to dwell in their villages, exclu&s;ive of them in their towns and cities, the calculation may not appear greatly exaggerated.</P>
<P>The nobles of Poland, have from time immemorial re&s;ided in the country, and each, inhabiting his own &s;eat, or ca&s;tle, manages his e&s;tate, by his va&s;&s;als, or hired &s;er|vants,
<PB N="175" REF="181">
and maintains him&s;elf, and his whole family by a|griculture, breeding of bees, grazing, and hunting. Some of the nobility &s;pend part of their time, in the cities or towns. There are among the Poli&s;h nobility, <HI>gentes</HI> or tribes, and the&s;e are divided into di&s;tinct families. Di|&s;tinction is not owing to the different places, or provinces where they live, but are ranked according to the names and arms they bear. Though Poland has its princes, counts, and barons, yet, the whole noble&s;&s;e, are naturally on a level, excepting, the difference ari&s;ing from the po&s;ts &s;ome of them enjoy. Hence all tho&s;e of noble birth call each other brothers.</P>
<P>The Poli&s;h nobility enjoy a great number of privileges, and, indeed, the boa&s;ted liberty of the kingdom, remains only with the nobles; for, they have the power of life and death over their va&s;&s;als, who, on that account groan under an oppre&s;&s;ive &s;lavery. Every nobleman, is ab&s;olute lord of his e&s;tates; in&s;omuch, that the King cannot demand any &s;ub&s;idy from him, nor oblige him to maintain, or find quarter, for any &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants in Poland, as in all feudal governments, are &s;laves; but, they are not all in an equal &s;tate of &s;ub|jection, they are di&s;tingui&s;hed into two &s;orts, the Germans, and the natives. During the reign of <HI>Bole&s;laus</HI> the Cha&s;te, and particularly in that of <HI>Ca&s;&s;imir</HI> the Great, many Ger|mans &s;ettled in Poland, who had the privilege on enjoying their own laws, and their de&s;cendants, &s;till continue the
<PB N="176" REF="182">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal privileges, not given to the Poli&s;h pea&s;ants. The good effects of the&s;e privileges, are very evident, in the general &s;tate of their dome&s;tic oeconomy; their villages are better built, their e&s;tates better cultivated, than tho&s;e of the native Poles, they have more heads of cattle, pay their lords more punctually, and are much neater in their per&s;ons and general appearance. The native pea&s;ant has ever laboured under the tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion of his lord, and his &s;lavery has always been extremely rigorous, until the time of <HI>Ca&s;&s;imir</HI> the Great, when the lord could not put his pri&s;oner to death with impunity. For in 1347, <HI>Ca&s;&s;imir</HI> levied a fine, for the murder of a pea&s;ant, and enacted, that in ca&s;e of his decea&s;e, without i&s;&s;ue, his im|mediate heir &s;hould inherit, and, that becau&s;e he was ca|pable of bearing arms, he &s;hould be con&s;idered as a free|man.</P>
<P>By &s;uch benevolent exertions and regulations, did this amiable monarch, endeavor to alleviate the mi&s;erable va&s;&s;alage of his &s;ubjects; but, they have all proved in|effectual, again&s;t the power and tyranny of the nobles, who have either eluded, or cau&s;ed them to be abrogated. Even now, there are above an hundred laws unfavourable to the pea&s;ants, which, among other greivances, erect &s;ummary tribunals, &s;ubject to no appeals, and impo&s;e the and impo&s;e the &s;evere&s;t penalties on tho&s;e, who quit their habitations without leave. From &s;uch numerous and oppre&s;&s;ive edicts, to prevent their emigration, do the pea|&s;ants &s;uffer &s;uch extreme wretchedne&s;s, who cannot be de|tained

in their native country, but by the terror of the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>The government of Poland is, with very great propriety &s;tiled a republic, becau&s;e the king is &s;o extremely limited in his prerogative, that he more re&s;embles the chief of a common-wealth, than the &s;overeign of a powerful mo|narchy. The &s;upreme legi&s;lative authority of the republic, re&s;ides in the three e&s;tates of the realm, the king, the &s;enate, and eque&s;trian order, a&s;&s;embled in a national diet. The executive power, which was heretofore intru&s;ted to the King and &s;enate, is now, according to the new form of government, inve&s;ted in the permanent council. The crown of Poland is elective, and all order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion pre|&s;cribed: any per&s;on who endeavours to break this law, is con&s;idered as an enemy to his country, and, is liable to be puni&s;hed accordingly. No per&s;on can be cho&s;en King, but a man of noble origin, that is, any gentleman, who is a native of Poland, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es landed property in the kingdom.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's titles are King of Poland; Great Duke of Lithuania; Duke of Ru&s;&s;ia, Pru&s;&s;ia, Ma&s;&s;orie, Samo|gitia, Keivie, &amp;c. The arms of the crown of Poland, are, in the fir&s;t and fourth, <HI>gules,</HI> an eagle <HI>argent,</HI> crowned and armed, <HI>Or,</HI> with &s;ome other bearings for the duke|doms.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="184">The mode of election is &s;omewhat &s;ingular. The place of a&s;&s;embly is in an open field, near the village of Wola, not far from War&s;aw, it is &s;urrounded with a ditch and a rampart, and has three gates, one of which is towards the ea&s;t, for Great Poland; the &s;econd towards the &s;outh, for Little Poland; and the third, facing the we&s;t, is for Lithuania. The &s;enators, or coun&s;ellors of &s;tate, are ac|comodated on this occa&s;ion, with a wooden-hou&s;e built for that purpo&s;e; without this edi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice, the repre&s;entatives a&s;|&s;emble in a place called <HI>Kola,</HI> that is a circle or crown, and tho&s;e noblemen, who attend the election in per&s;on, pitch their tents at a greater di&s;tance from it. The &s;overeign is elected, by the &s;piritual and temporal coun&s;ellors of &s;tate; and, none but Roman catholics, dare appear at the ceremony. The King is elected on hor&s;eback, and in ca&s;e their &s;hould be a turbulent minority, the majority im|mediately quell the tumult, by cut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing them to pieces with their &s;abres. The King elect, then &s;wears to ob&s;erve the <HI>Pacta Conventa,</HI> which are drawn up in the Poli&s;h lan|guage, and admini&s;tred by the &s;tates; after this, he is proclaimed King; and crowned in the cathedral of Cracow, by the arch bi&s;hop of <HI>Gne&s;na.</HI> In &s;igning the <HI>Pacta-Conventa,</HI> he engages to introduce no foreigners into the army or government; &s;o that in fact, he is little more than the pre&s;ident of the &s;enate, which is compo&s;ed of a pri|mate, the arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>L&eacute;mburgh,</HI> the bi&s;hops, and 130 laymen; con&s;i&s;ting, of the great officers of &s;tate, the Pa|latines, and Ca&s;tellans. The King is not permitted to enter into war, to a&s;&s;emble an army, conclude a peace,
<PB N="179" REF="185">
or make any public alliances; neither is he inve&s;ted with the power of &s;ending envoys on any important occa&s;ion, impo&s;ing taxes, contributions or cu&s;toms, or of coining money, without the con&s;ent of the &s;tates. He can make no laws, determine no religious di&s;putes, nor can he alienate any of the royal deme&s;nes. Neither is he per|mitted to undertake, or carry into execution, any matters of importance, that concern the kingdom, without the con&s;ent of the &s;tates, duly convened. His chief preroga|tive is, the having the di&s;po&s;al of the po&s;ts of honour, and royal deme&s;nes; but, without con&s;ulting the &s;tates, he cannot increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the honorary po&s;ts, nor confer upon one per&s;on, more than one office, neither is it in his power to di&s;place any per&s;on, when once appointed.</P>
<P>Should the King be ab&s;ent, his place is &s;upplied by the arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Gne&s;na,</HI> if that &s;ee is vacant, by the bi&s;hop of <HI>Plo&s;ko.</HI></P>
<P>The con&s;titution of Poland, is &s;ubject to &s;o many changes, that it is difficult to &s;peak of it with certainty, for it is new modelled, with every King, according to the <HI>Pacta Conventa</HI> he is obliged to &s;ign, yet it &s;till pre&s;erves the outlines, of a noble and free government.</P>
<P>The diets of Poland, are extraordinary, the former meet once in two or three years, and the latter, is &s;um|moned by the King, upon critical emergencies; but, one di&s;&s;enting voice, renders all their deliberations ineffectual.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="186">On important mea&s;ures, the King &s;ends the heads of the bu&s;ine&s;s that is to be treated of, which are given to the provincial diet a&s;&s;embled for the purpo&s;e of con&s;ultation. The <HI>Staro&s;ts</HI> are governors, and judges in their particular &s;taro&s;ties, or di&s;tricts, and make reports of the opinion of the a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>There are ten principal officers of &s;tate, who are &s;ena|tors; the two great mar&s;halls, one of Poland, the other of Lithuania; the chancellor of the kingdom, and the chan|cellor of the duchy; the trea&s;urer of the kingdom, and of the duchy; the &s;ub-mar&s;hal, or mar&s;hal of the court of the kingdom, and the &s;ame of the court of the duchy. The King pre&s;ides over the public welfare, which is com|mitted to his care, and he con&s;ults the &s;tates about every thing relative to the kingdom. He is the protector both of the laws, and his &s;ubjects, and all courts of judicature are held in his name. He grants titles of nobility, but not privileges annexed to tho&s;e titles, which require the con|&s;ent of the &s;tates; and, when no diet is a&s;&s;embled, he can con&s;ult with the coun&s;ellors, and mini&s;ters of his court, He can &s;ummon the nobility on any emergency, has the chief command of the army, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many other prerogatives of le&s;s importance.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t extraordinary characteri&s;tic, is the con&s;titution of Poland, and, which &s;eems peculiarly to di&s;tingui&s;h this government from all others, both in ancient and modern times, is the <HI>liberum veto,</HI> or tribunal negative,
<PB N="181" REF="187">
that is ve&s;ted in every member of a diet, or <HI>dietine,</HI> and which mu&s;t ever be de&s;tructive of good order, and govern|ment; becau&s;e, they have not only (like the tribunes of ancient Rome), a power of putting a negative upon any law, but even of di&s;&s;olving the a&s;&s;embly. That every member of a numerous &s;ociety, &s;hould be inve&s;ted with &s;uch a dangerous privilege, in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t im|portant national tran&s;actions, is a circum&s;tance, at once incredible, pregnant with anarchy, and detrimental to the public welfare. The privilege originated under the ad|mini&s;tration of <HI>John Ca&s;&s;imir,</HI> in the year 1652, when the diet of War&s;aw, was debating upon tran&s;actions of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, which required a &s;peedy determina|tion, one <HI>Sicin&s;ki,</HI> nuntio of Ulpita in Lithuania, cried out, "I &s;top the proceedings." Having uttered the&s;e words, he quitted the a&s;&s;embly, and repairing immediately to the chancellor, prote&s;ted; that as many acts had been propo&s;|ed, and carried, contrary to the con&s;titution of the repub|lic, if the diet continued to &s;it, he &s;hould con&s;ider it as an infringment of the laws. The members were thunder|&s;truck at a prote&s;t of this nature, hitherto unknown. Warm debates en&s;ued about the continuing or di&s;&s;olving the diet, at length, however, the venal and di&s;contented faction, that &s;upported the prote&s;t, obtained the majority; and the a&s;&s;embly broke up in confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>From the continual revolutions, which the con&s;titution of Poland &s;uffers, we may ea&s;ily infer, that notwith&s;tand|ing their boa&s;ted liberty, the Poles are by no means a free

people. Indeed, their hi&s;torians, however they may differ, in many points, unanimou&s;ly agree in reprobating their affectation of liberty; the &s;hadow, rather than the reality of freedom, which is in fact, merely a turbulent &s;y&s;tem of ari&s;tocratic licentiou&s;ne&s;s, where a few members of the community, are above the controul of law; while the ma|jority, are excluded from its protection. As a proof of this a&s;&s;ertion, and prevailing di&s;content, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, no circum&s;tance can better evince its truth, than the fol|lowing extraordinary attempt upon the life of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty. The particulars of which we beg leave to give our readers, as authentically related by Mr. <HI>Coxe.</HI> The &s;tory is affecting, and intere&s;ting to an Engli&s;hman, be|cau&s;e the per&s;on of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, <HI>Stani&s;laus Augu&s;tus,</HI> is well known to many; and his re&s;idence in England, all mu&s;t be acquainted with.</P>
<P>The King being con&s;idered by a &s;et of confederates, as unlawfully elected, they imputed to his fatal elevation, all the various ills, under which the kingdom groaned, from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Ru&s;&s;ians; and formed a plan, the mo&s;t daring, modern hi&s;tory can mention, by an attempt to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him.</P>
<P>A Poli&s;h nobleman, named <HI>Pula&s;ki,</HI> a general in the army of the confederates, was the per&s;on who formed the dangerous enterprize; and the con&s;pirators who executed it, were about forty in number, headed by three chiefs, <HI>Lukaw&s;ki, Strawen&s;ki,</HI> and <HI>Ko&s;ink&s;i.</HI> The&s;e chiefs had
<PB N="183" REF="189">
been engaged, and hired, by <HI>Pula&s;ki,</HI> who obliged them by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oath, either to deliver up the King alive, into his hands if po&s;&s;ible, or el&s;e put him to death; they were to have thirty-&s;even per&s;ons to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. On the 2d. of November, they obtained admi&s;&s;ion into War&s;aw, un&s;u&s;pected, or undi&s;covered, by di&s;gui&s;ing them&s;elves as pea&s;ants, who came to &s;ell hay, which they brought in waggons, the more effectually to e&s;cape detection.</P>
<P>On Sunday night, the 3d. of September, 1771, a few of the&s;e con&s;pirators remained in the town; and the others, placed them&s;elves, when his maje&s;ty was expected to pa&s;s, at his u&s;ual hour of returning to the palace. The King had been on a vi&s;it to his uncle, prince <HI>Zartori&s;ki,</HI> grand chancellor of Lithuania, and was on his return from thence, between nine and ten o'clock. He was in his coach, ac|companied by his aid-de-camp, and fifteen, or &s;ixteen at|tendants; when attacked by the con&s;pirators, he was only at the di&s;tance of two hundred paces, from the prince's palace, who commanded the coachman to &s;top, on pain of in&s;tant death. They fired &s;everal &s;hots into the car|riage, one of which, pa&s;&s;ed through the body of a Hey|duc, who endeavoured to defend his ma&s;ter from the vio|lence of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. The aid-de-camp, together with all the remainder of the attendants, immediately fled, and endeavoured to &s;ecure them&s;elves. Mean while the King had opened the door of his carriage, to effect his e&s;cape, under the &s;helter of the night, which was extremely dark; he had even alighted, when the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;eized him by the
<PB N="184" REF="190">
hair, exclaiming with horrible execrations, <Q>We have thee now, thy hour is come!</Q> &mdash;One di&s;charged a pi&s;tol at him, &s;o very near, that he felt the heat of the fla&s;h, whil&s;t another cut him acro&s;s the head with his &s;abre, and pe|netrated the bone; then &s;eizing him by the collar, and mounting him on her&s;eback, they dragged him along the ground, between their hor&s;es, at full gallop, for near five hundred paces, through the &s;treets of War&s;aw. All was confu&s;ion and di&s;order, during this time at the palace, where the attendants who had de&s;erted their ma&s;ter, had &s;pread the alarm. The foot-guards ran to the &s;pot from whence the King had been conveyed, but found only his hat, which being bloody, increa&s;ed their apprehen&s;ions for his life. The whole city being in an uproar, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins profitted by the general confu&s;ion; and finding the King almo&s;t incapable of breathing, from the violence with which they had dragged him, they mounted him on hor&s;e|back, and redoubled their &s;peed, fearing to be overtaken. When they came to the ditch at War&s;aw, they forced him to leap his hor&s;e over, which in attempting the hor&s;e fell, and broke his leg. They then mounted his Maje&s;ty on another, all covered with dirt as he was, and having cro&s;&s;ed the ditch, began to rifle the King, by tearing off the eagle of the order of Pru&s;&s;ia, which he wore round his neck, and the diamond cro&s;s hanging to it. He intreated them to leave his handkerchief, to which they con&s;ented; his tablets likewi&s;e e&s;caped their rapacity. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins having thus plundered him, for the mo&s;t part retired, with an intent, probably, to notify to their re|&s;pective
<PB N="185" REF="191">
leaders the &s;ucce&s;s of their enterprize, and the ap|proach of the King, as a pri&s;oner. Only &s;even remained, of which <HI>Ko&s;in&s;ki</HI> was the chief. The night being dark they mi&s;took their way, and, as the hor&s;es could not keep their legs, the King was obliged to follow them on foot, with only one &s;hoe, the other being lo&s;t in the dirt. They continued to wander in uncertain paths, without getting any di&s;tance from War&s;aw; and remounting the King on hor&s;eback, they were proceeding; two of them holding him on each &s;ide by the hand, and a third leading his hor&s;e; when his Maje&s;ty finding they had taken a road which led to a village called Burakow, warned them not to enter it, becau&s;e there were &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ians &s;tationed in that place, who might attempt to re&s;cue him.

This reque&s;t was complied with, and ignorant of their way, they at length found them&s;elves in a wood, a league di&s;|tant from War&s;aw. From the time they had pa&s;&s;ed the ditch, they repeatedly demanded of <HI>Ko&s;inski,</HI> if it was not time to kill the King, and the&s;e demands were reiterated in proportion to the ob&s;tacles and difficulties they encoun|tered.

an oath taken to perpetrate &s;o heinous an action. <HI>Ko&s;in&s;ki</HI> lent attention to his di&s;cour&s;e, and began to betray &s;ome remor&s;e, "but," &s;aid he, <Q>if I &s;hould con&s;ent, and re|conduct you to War&s;aw, I &s;hall be taken and exe|cuted.</Q></P>
<P>This reflection plunged him into new uncertainties and embara&s;&s;ments. "I give you my word," an&s;wered his Maje&s;ty, <Q>that you &s;hall &s;uffer no harm; but, if you doubt my promi&s;e, e&s;cape, while there is yet time. I can find my way to &s;ome place of &s;ecurity, and will certainly direct your pur&s;uers, to take a contrary road to that which you have cho&s;en.</Q>
<HI>Ko&s;in&s;ki</HI> could no longer contain him|&s;elf, but, pro&s;trated at his feet, implored forgivne&s;s for the crime he had committed, and &s;wore to protect him again&s;t every enemy, relying on his genero&s;ity for pardon and pre&s;ervation. His Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ured him of his &s;afety; but judging it prudent to gain &s;ome a&s;ylum without delay, he made towards a mill, at &s;ome di&s;tance off. <HI>Ko&s;in&s;ki</HI> knocked but in vain; no an&s;wer was given; he then broke a pane of gla&s;s in the window; and intreated &s;helter, for a noble|man who had been plundered by robbers. The miller refu&s;ed, thinking them the banditti, and continued for &s;ome time to per&s;i&s;t in his denial. The King then ap|proached, and looking through the broken pane, prevailed with the miller, by &s;aying, <Q>If we were robbers, as you &s;uppo&s;e, it would be very ea&s;y for us to break the whole window, in&s;tead of one pane of gla&s;s.</Q> This argument procured admittance, and the King wrote the following
<PB N="188" REF="195">
note to general <HI>Coccei,</HI> colonel of the foot-guards. <Q>By a kind of miracle, I have e&s;caped from the hands of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and am now at the mill of Mariemont, come as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible and take me from hence. I am wounded, but not dangerou&s;ly.</Q> It was with great difficulty the King could per&s;uade any one to carry the note to War&s;aw, the people of the mill imagining, he was a nobleman, ju&s;t plundered by robbers, they feared lea&s;t they &s;hould fall in with the troop. <HI>Ko&s;in&s;ki</HI> offered to re&s;tore what he had taken; but the King left him all, ex|cept the blue ribbon of the white eagle.</P>
<P>When the me&s;&s;enger arrived with the note, the joy and a&s;toni&s;hment was incredible. <HI>Coccei</HI> in&s;tantly rode to the mill, followed by a detachment of the guards. He met <HI>Ko&s;in&s;ki</HI> at the door, with his &s;abre drawn, who admitted him, as &s;oon as he knew him. The King had &s;unk into a profound &s;leep, from extreme fatigue, and was &s;tretched on the ground, covered with a miller's cloak. <HI>Coccei</HI> threw him&s;elf at his Maje&s;ty's feet, calling him his &s;overeign, and ki&s;&s;ing his hand.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to paint, or de&s;cribe, the a&s;toni&s;hment of the miller, and his family; who in&s;tantly imitated <HI>Coccei</HI>'s example, by throwing them&s;elves on their knees. The King returned to War&s;aw, in the general's carriage and &s;oon recovered the wound and brui&s;es he had received. The diet at the reque&s;t of the King, remitted the capital puni&s;hment of the inferior con&s;pirators, and condemned
<PB N="189" REF="196">
them only to work for life. By his benevolent interce&s;&s;ion, the different modes of torture, and horrible puni&s;hments inflicted on regicides, were mitigated; and both <HI>Lukawski,</HI> and <HI>Strawenski,</HI> were only &s;imply beheaded. <HI>Ko&s;inski</HI> was detained under very &s;trict confinement, and was obliged to give evidence again&s;t his two companions.</P>
<P>On general <HI>Coccei</HI>'s arrival at the mill, the fir&s;t que&s;tion his Maje&s;ty a&s;ked, was, whether any of his attendants had &s;uffered from the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and, upon being informed, one of the Heyducs was killed on the &s;pot, and another dangerou&s;ly wounded, his mind, naturally feeling, now rendered more &s;u&s;ceptible by his late danger, was greatly affected, and his joy, at his own e&s;cape, con&s;iderably di|dimin&s;hed.</P>
<P>Upon his return to War&s;aw, continues Mr. <HI>Coxe,</HI> the &s;treets were illuminated, and crouded with people, who followed, ince&s;&s;antly crying "The King is alive." When he entered the palace, the doors were flung open, and per|&s;ons of all ranks were admitted in his pre&s;ence, to felicitate him on his e&s;cape. The &s;cene was affecting beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion, every one &s;truggled to get near him, to ki&s;s his hand, or even to touch his cloaths; all were &s;o tran&s;ported with joy, that they even loaded <HI>Ko&s;inski</HI> with care&s;&s;es, and called him the &s;aviour of their King. His Maje&s;ty was &s;o affected with the&s;e &s;igns of zeal and affection, that he expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t feeling manner, his &s;trong &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="190" REF="197">
their attachment, and declared it was the happie&s;t hour of his whole life.</P>
<P>The family of the Heyduc, who had &s;aved the King's life, by the lo&s;s of his own, was amply provided for; and, his body was buried with great pomp, with an elegant in|&s;cription, expre&s;&s;ive of the man's fidelity, and his own gratitude. The monument is a pyramid, &s;tanding upon a &s;arcophagus with a Latin and Poli&s;h in&s;cription, the tran&s;lation of which, is as follows.</P>
<P><Q>Here lies <HI>Henry Butzau,</HI> who on the third of No|vember, 1771, oppo&s;ing his own brea&s;t, to &s;hield <HI>Stani|&s;laus Augu&s;tus</HI> from the weapons of nefarious paricides, was pierced with repeated wounds, and gloriou&s;ly ex|pired. The King lamenting the death of a faithful &s;ub|ject, erected this monument as a tribute to him, and an incentive to others.</Q></P>
<P>Having &s;poken of the &s;ufferings of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty of Poland, it may not be unacceptable to give &s;ome ac|count of the remarkable partition of the kingdom, which was planned &s;oon after the King's e&s;cape; and in&s;tigated with &s;uch profound &s;ecrecy, that it was &s;carcely &s;u&s;pected, before it was carried into execution. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, the Empre&s;s Queen, and the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, had en|tered into an alliance to di&s;member the kingdom of Po|land.

upon Brandenburg. For the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, Poli&s;h or we&s;tern Pru&s;&s;ia had long been an object of his ambition; exclu&s;ive of its fertility, commerce, and population, its local &s;ituation rendered it highly valuable to that monarch; it lay between his German dominions, and ea&s;tern Pru&s;&s;ia, and while po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Poles, cut off, at their will, all communication between them. During the cour&s;e of the la&s;t general war, he experienced the mo&s;t fatal effects from the disjointed &s;tate of his territories. By the acqui&s;ition of we&s;tern Pru&s;&s;ia, his dominions would be rendered compact, and his troops in time of war, be able to march from Ber|lin to Koning&s;burg, without interruption. Almo&s;t all the &s;outhern and ea&s;tern parts of the kingdom, bordering upon Hungary, together with the rich &s;alt-works of the crown, were marked out for the Empre&s;s Queen of Hungary and Bohemia; and a large di&s;trict of country about Mohilow, upon the banks of the Dnieper, for the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia. But though each of the&s;e powers, pretended a legal right to the territories allotted to them re&s;pectively, and pub|li&s;hed manife&s;toes in ju&s;tification of the mea&s;ures which they had taken, yet as they were con&s;cious, that the fal&s;e rea&s;onings by which they &s;upported their preten&s;ions, were too gro&s;s to impo&s;e upon mankind, they forced the Poles to a&s;&s;emble a new diet, and threatened them if they did not con&s;ent unanimou&s;ly, to &s;ign a treaty, for the ceding of tho&s;e provinces to them, the whole kingdom &s;hould be laid under a military execution, and treated as a conquered &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="199">In this extremity of di&s;tre&s;s, &s;everal of the Poli&s;h noble|men, prote&s;ted again&s;t this violent act of tyranny, and re|tired into foreign &s;tates, chu&s;ing rather to live in exile, to have their landed property confi&s;cated, than be in&s;trumen|tal, in &s;igning the ruin of their country; but the King was prevailed on, to put his &s;ignature to the act, and his example was followed by many of his &s;ubjects. As the troops of the three courts, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t part of Poland, nothing remained towards compleating the partition, but the acce&s;&s;ion of the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, who regarded with a jealous eye, the introduction of foreign powers into Poland. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an uncontrolled a&s;cen|dancy over the whole country, &s;he could propo&s;e no ma|terial advantage, from the formal acqui&s;ition of a part, and mu&s;t purcha&s;e a moderate addition to her territory, by a con&s;iderable &s;urrender of her authority. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, well acquainted with the intere&s;ts of Ru&s;&s;ia, in re|gard to Poland, and the capacity of the Empre&s;s to di&s;|cern tho&s;e intere&s;ts, forbore opening any negociation, on the &s;ubject of the partition, until &s;he was involved in a Turki&s;h war. He then &s;ent his brother, Prince Henry, to Peter&s;burgh, who &s;ugge&s;ted to the Empre&s;s, that the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria was forming an alliance with the Porte, which, if it took place, would create a mo&s;t formidable combination again&s;t her; that the friend&s;hip of that Hou&s;e was to be purcha&s;ed, by acceding to the partition; that, upon this condition, the Emperor was willing to renounce his connection with the Grand Signior, and would &s;uffer the Ru&s;&s;ians to pro&s;ecute the war without mole&s;tation.
<PB N="193" REF="200">
The Queen, anxious to pu&s;h her conque&s;ts again&s;t the Turks, and dreading the interpo&s;ition of the Emperor in that quarter; perceiving likewi&s;e, between the Courts of Vienna and Berlin, that it would not be in her power, at the pre&s;ent juncture, to prevent the intended partition, clo&s;ed with the propo&s;al, and &s;elected no incon&s;iderable portion of the Poli&s;h territories for her&s;elf. The treaty was &s;igned in Feb. 1772, by the Ru&s;&s;ian, Au&s;trian, and Pru&s;&s;ian plenipotentiaries.</P>
<P>This violent di&s;memberment and partition of Poland, has ju&s;tly been con&s;idered as the fir&s;t great breach in the modern political &s;y&s;tem of Europe, which awaited in anxious expectation, what would be the i&s;&s;ue of this un|expected union; yet &s;uch was the &s;ecrecy with which the partitioning powers proceeded, that for &s;ome time after the ratification of the treaty, only vague conjectures were entertained, even at War&s;aw, concerning their real inten|tions; and the late Lord <HI>Cathcart,</HI> the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter at Peter&s;burgh, was able to obtain no authentic informa|tion of its &s;ignature, until two months after the event.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious to enter into a detail of the pleas urged by the three powers, in favour of their &s;everal demands, and no le&s;s unintere&s;ting to lay before the rea|der, the an&s;wers and remon&s;trances of the King and &s;e|nate, as well as the appeals to the other &s;tates, which had guaranteed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Poland. The courts of London, Paris, Stockholm, and Copenhagen, remon|&s;trated
<PB N="194" REF="201">
again&s;t the u&s;urpations, but remon&s;trances without a&s;&s;i&s;tance can avail but little. Poland &s;ubmitted to the di&s;memberment, not without the mo&s;t violent &s;truggles, and now, for the fir&s;t time, &s;everely felt, and lamented the fatal effects of faction and di&s;cord.</P>
<P>The conduct of the late King of Pru&s;&s;ia, has greatly oppre&s;&s;ed the kingdom; his exactions were enormous, and his penalties the mo&s;t &s;evere. He obliged the prie&s;ts to abandon their abbeys, convents, and cathedrals; and the nobles were forced to quit their lands. From all his pro|ceedings, it would appear, that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty ac|knowledged no right, but his own; no preten&s;ions, but tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e of Brandenburg; and no rule of ju&s;|tice, but his own pride and ambition. Even to his death he had an eye to a change in the con&s;titution, and endeavoured to make the crown hereditary, in&s;tead of being elective.</P>
<P>The revenues of the King ari&s;e chiefly from the crown|lands, the &s;alt-mines in the Palatinate of Cracow, ancient tolls and cu&s;toms, particularly tho&s;e of Elbing and Dant|zic, the rents of Marienburg, Dir&s;hau and Rogenhus, and of the government of Cracow and di&s;trict of Nie|poliomicz; but, by the late di&s;memberment, Poland lo&s;t nearly half her annual income. The King, however, draws from the public trea&s;ury &pound;.74,074 &s;terling; which, in addition to the remaining royal deme&s;nes, and &s;ome &s;tario&s;ties granted for his u&s;e, make the pre&s;ent income the &s;ame as before the di&s;memberment. Out of this income,
<PB N="195" REF="202">
he only pays his hou&s;hold expences, and menial &s;ervants; the &s;alary of the great officers of &s;tate, and the other ge|neral expences, being &s;upplied from the public fund. The whole revenue of the government, including the royal deme&s;nes and &s;tario&s;ties lately granted to the King, amount to &pound;. 443,938; out of which, when the King has received his privy pur&s;e, there remains only &pound;. 248,938: 1 <HI>s.</HI> a &s;um &s;o &s;mall, that it hardly &s;eems in any wi&s;e equal to the purpo&s;es for which it is de&s;igned. And yet it is nearly adequate to the ordinary current expences: for the regu|lar army is &s;mall; the great officers of &s;tate receive little or nothing from the public trea&s;ury, being amply rewarded with the royal fiefs, which are &s;o numerous and profitable; each palatinate pays its own officers, from its private trea|&s;ury; while the &s;everal judges, ju&s;tices of the peace, and other civil officers, who enjoy the territorial juri&s;diction, may enrich them&s;elves &s;ufficiently, by extortions and op|pre&s;&s;ions, without any &s;alary.</P>

<P>THE ordinary army of the Poles con&s;i&s;ts of 36,000 men in Poland, and 12,000 in Lithuania, cantoned into crown-lands. The King has a corps of 2000 troops
<PB N="196" REF="203">
in his own pay, and entirely dependent upon him&s;elf: the&s;e troops chiefly con&s;i&s;t of ulans, or light hor&s;e, who furni&s;h alternately the e&s;cort which accompanies his Maje&s;ty. The ulans are chiefly Tartars, many of them Mahometans, and are greatly to be relied on for their fidelity. The corps is compo&s;ed of gentlemen and va&s;&s;als, all forming in &s;qua|dron together, though differently armed; they both, in|di&s;criminately, carry &s;abres and pi&s;tols, but the gentlemen, only bear lances, of about ten feet long, in&s;tead of which, the others are armed with carabines. Their dre&s;s is a high fur cap, a green and red jacket, pantaloons of the &s;ame colour, which cover the boots as low as the knee, and a petticoat of white cloth, de&s;cending to the knee. Their lances, at the end of which is fa&s;tened a long &s;wal|low-tailed flag, of black or red cloth, are &s;horter and weaker than tho&s;e of the Au&s;trian croats; but they carry and u&s;e them much in the &s;ame manner, and with no le&s;s dexterity. The men are well grown, and hand&s;ome, but, greatly disfigured with their petticoats and pantaloons. The hor&s;es on which they are mounted, are about fourteen hands high, of remarkable &s;pirit, and with great &s;trength of &s;houlder. Poland is much e&s;teemed, for its breed of hor&s;es; and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia procures his light cavalry from this country. The breed has been much injured by the late civil wars, and the nobility are now chiefly &s;upplied from Tartary.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="204">The armies of Poland and Lithuania are independent of each other, being &s;eparately commanded, and under the directions of their re&s;pective generals; but, in time of war, the King in per&s;on generally leads the army. Every Poli&s;h gentleman has a right to maintain as many troops as he plea&s;es, which occa&s;ions perpetual petty di&s;&s;entions and di&s;putes, &s;o that the whole kingdom may be a &s;cene of endle&s;s commotion; it redounds, therefore, greatly to the honour of the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the Poles, that, amid the&s;e incentives to confu&s;ion, a much greater degree of tranquility is maintained, than could well be conceived.</P>
<P>In delineating the military e&s;tabli&s;hment, we &s;hould not omit the Ru&s;&s;ian troops, which, having been long quar|tered in this country, may be con&s;idered as forming part of the national army.</P>
<P>The whole kingdom till lately was under the pro|tection, of Ru&s;&s;ia, who ruled over it, with as much unbounded authority as over one of its own provinces. The King in effect, was but a vice-roy, whil&s;t the Ru&s;|&s;ian amba&s;&s;ador had the real &s;overeignty, and regulated all the affairs of the kingdom, according to his own direction. The empre&s;s maintained within the country near 10,000 &s;oldiers. Every garri&s;on was compo&s;ed of Ru&s;&s;ian and na|tive troops; a thou&s;and of the former were &s;tationed at War&s;aw, and each gate of the town, guarded by a Ru&s;|&s;ian and Poli&s;h centinel. Such was the &s;ituation of Poland, and to what a wretched &s;tate, mu&s;t that country be re|duced
<PB N="198" REF="205">
which owes its tranquility to the interpo&s;ition of a foreign army.</P>
<P>Atrocious crimes &s;uch as murder, &amp;c. are puni&s;hed by beheading or hanging; le&s;&s;er delinquencies, by whipping, hard-labour, and impri&s;onment. The nobles never &s;uffer any corporal puni&s;hment; but are liable only to impri&s;on|ment and death. The criminal cau&s;es of the nobility are decided in the ducal &s;upreme court, to which the &s;uperiors are &s;ummoned as a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; however, an appeal lies to the King, except in cau&s;es of wilful murder, burning of hou&s;es, robbery, rapes or open violence. Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es are tried by the chancellor, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;uperintendant and provo&s;ts. If any di&s;putes happen to ari&s;e between the duke and nobility, they are decided only by the King in per&s;on. The admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in the towns, belong either to the magi&s;trate, or the prefect of the di&s;trict, in which the defendant lives, according to the nature of the cau&s;e; and the &s;econd or la&s;t in&s;tance, or hearing, is at the ducal court. Torture was aboli&s;hed in 1776, by an edict of the diet, introduced by the influence of the King; a re|gulation as expre&s;&s;ive of his Maje&s;ty's judgment, as of his benevolence. It is an infinite &s;atisfaction, to &s;ee the rights of humanity, extending them&s;elves into countries, where they had been but little known; a circum&s;tance that mu&s;t ca&s;t a great reflexion on tho&s;e nations, which like France, have attained the highe&s;t pitch of civilization, and yet, has retained to this period, the u&s;ele&s;s, and barbarous cu&s;tom of torture. In laws relating to debtors, the creditor proceeds
<PB N="199" REF="206">
again&s;t the debtor, at his own expence; and, until the trial is fini&s;hed, allows him three-halfpence a day for his main|tenance; when the debt is proved, the creditor is relea&s;ed from the above-mentioned contribution. The debtor continues in pri&s;on at the di&s;cretion of the creditor, until the debt is di&s;charged; and if he has no means of &s;ub&s;is|tance, is obliged to maintain him&s;elf, by working with the other delinquents in cutting wood, &s;awing &s;tone, or clean|ing the &s;treets. In ca&s;e a gentleman contracts a debt, an action lies again&s;t his lands and goods, and not again&s;t his per&s;on, unle&s;s he gives a note of hand with a double &s;ig|nature, one intended as an a&s;certainment of the debt, the other as a renunciation of his exemption from arre&s;ts; but a per&s;on of high di&s;tinction, even though he &s;hould bind him&s;elf by this engagement, can bid defiance to all danger of impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>From this &s;ketch of the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in this country, the expediency of a thorough reformation is very apparent. But as any innovations in the courts of ju&s;tice, calculated to produce any e&s;&s;ential benefit, mu&s;t materially infringe on the privileges of the nobles, and counter-act the national prejudices, the mo&s;t u&s;eful code can &s;carcely ex|pect to receive the &s;anction of the diet.</P>

Towards the north, it is bor|dered by Samogitia; towards the ea&s;t, by the Lithua|nian Palatinates of Trocko and Podolia; on the &s;outh lies Poland, and Ma&s;ovia; and on the we&s;t, it is bounded by Poli&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia, and the Baltic Sea. Its length from the northern extremity near Deut&s;ch-Krottengen, to Soldau, is forty German miles, and its breadth from the great duchy of Lithuania near Schiwind to the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Samland is twenty-four German miles. In other places it is much narrower. Each German mile is nearly equal to five Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Pru&s;&s;ia thus bounded, does not take in Pru&s;&s;ia Royal, which was &s;ubject to Poland,
<PB N="168" REF="208">
but only that which was called Ducal Ru&s;&s;ia, and belonged to the hou&s;e of Brandenburg. Poli&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia, in the year 1771, was &s;eized, by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, from Poland; as al&s;o the cities of Dantzic, Thorn, and Elbing, free cities, then under the protection of Poland. So that the dominions of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia are the large&s;t of any of the German princes, except tho&s;e of the hou&s;e of Au|&s;tria. They contain 3650 &s;quare German miles, which is equal to the kingdoms of Naples, Sicily, and Portugal, put together.</P>
<P>As many parts of the king of of Pru&s;&s;ia's dominions lie &s;cattered abroad, it may not be improper to enumerate them. In Poland, he has Royal Pru&s;&s;ia; in Upper-Sax|ony, Brandenburg, Pomerania, and Swedi&s;h Pomerania; in Lower-Saxony, Magduberg, and Halber&s;tadt; in We&s;t|phalia, Raven&s;burg, Lingen, Cleves, Meurs, and Mark; in the Netherlands, Gelder; in Switzerland, Neufchatel; and add to the&s;e, Ea&s;t Frie&s;land, Lippe. Gulich, and Tecklenburg.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the climate of Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia, the la&s;t two months of &s;pring, and the fir&s;t two &s;ummer months, are temperate, warm, and plea&s;ant, and the weather gene|rally very favourable to ripen the fruits of the earth: but, before and after the&s;e mouths, the air is cold and piercing, the autumn being often wet, and the winter &s;evere. The air, however, is well purified, by high winds, and fre|quent &s;torms.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="209">The chief rivers are the Vi&s;tula, &s;poken of in our de|&s;cription of Poland, the Pregel, the Memel, the Pa&s;&s;ar|ge and the Alle. The&s;e are partly navigable, but at certain times of the year, and in high winds, are apt to overflow their banks, and cau&s;e dreadful inundations.</P>
<P>The country is watered al&s;o, by &s;everal large bays, lakes, and canals, which yield great plenty of fi&s;h; and the convenience of a water communication between &s;eve|ral towns, for the conveyance of merchandize, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The bay or lake Fri&s;che-Haf, is from one and a quarter, to three German miles in breadth, and twelve in length; and has a communication with the Baltic. Its mouth into the &s;ea, is an Engli&s;h mile over, and its depth twelve feet. The bay Fi&s;che-Haf, is thirteen German miles long, and &s;ix broad; and joins the &s;ea near Memel, where it is and Engli&s;h mile broad, and nineteen feet deep. The coa&s;ts are every where inhabited by fi&s;hermen, called <HI>Curen.</HI></P>
<P>There are a great number of Inland lakes, from one to eight German miles long, and one or two in breadth. Tho&s;e of Spirding, Ange&s;burg, Rein, and Drau&s;en, are the principal.</P>
<P>The &s;oil produces plenty of corn, e&s;culent herbs, fruits, and pa&s;turage. Pru&s;&s;ia abounds with flocks and herds, and exceeding fine hor&s;es. Its chief commodities are
<PB N="170" REF="210">
wool, honey, wax; pitch, pit coal, flax, hemp, hops, and buck-wheat.</P>
<P>This country al&s;o affords plenty of game, as white and common hares, elks, &s;tags, deer, roebucks, and wild boars; is is al&s;o infe&s;ted with bea&s;ts of prey, as lynxes, wolves, foxes, and bears. In Little Lithuania, are fine flocks of &s;heep, and very excellent hor&s;es.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome few woods, but the&s;e are dimini&s;hing, particularly, tho&s;e of oak. Among other productions of this country, the Ru&s;&s;ian manna, called <HI>&s;chwadengru&s;&s;e</HI> is found in the meadows, on the top of a kind of gra&s;s, and gathered in the morning, whil&s;t the dew lies on it. Am|ber is found in great quantities, on the coa&s;ts of the Baltic, in Ru&s;&s;ia, e&s;pecially on the Samland &s;hore. It owes its origin to a &s;ulphurous matter, and is pellucid, and gener|ally of a yellow colour. That it was once in a fluid &s;tate is manife&s;t, from the number of flies, &s;piders, and other in&s;ects, &amp;c. which are found frequently inclo&s;ed in it. Amber is found chiefly in large trees, buried under ground, in a vitriolic earth. The profits ari&s;ing from it, is one of the Pru&s;&s;ian regalia, and amount annually, to about 26,000 dollars. It is chiefly u&s;ed by turners, who make a variety of toys of it.</P>
<P>The beautiful red colour, &s;o renowned in Pru&s;&s;ia, and called St. John's blood, is made of the eggs of a worm, or &s;mall in&s;ect, there found. The country contains &s;ome iron
<PB N="171" REF="211">
ore, but yields neither &s;alt, wine, nor minerals; being for the mo&s;t part, a plain, champaign country.</P>
<P>The late King having taken &s;ome pains, to promote agriculture, the farmer &s;eems more at ea&s;e, than any other cla&s;s of men. The trading part of the people, and the army, are compelled to con&s;ume the productions of their own country; and of cour&s;e, their provi&s;ions are dearer, than tho&s;e of other countries. The late king has cultivated large tracts of wa&s;te land, drained mora&s;&s;es, and built, and improved many hundred villages. In almo&s;t every village, is a nobleman who&s;e principal occupation is agriculture; and &s;eeds are imported from Poland, Ru&s;&s;ia, England, and other countries. There is a privy coun|&s;ellor, by name <HI>Brenkenhoff,</HI> a man, who born without one penny, has made him&s;elf worth millions, by his indu&s;try and agriculture. He &s;ent for rye from Archangel, which &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that his &s;eeds were begged throughout Pomerania, Sile&s;ia, Brandenburg, and Ru&s;&s;ia; and, the country gained con&s;iderable &s;ums, which before u&s;ed to be paid to the Poles and Ru&s;&s;ians, for this commodity. In con&s;equence of this, whenever Mr. <HI>Brenkenhoff,</HI> had any thing to a&s;k of the King, for him&s;elf, or his province, he always couched his reque&s;t, in the following manner. "Had I not brought rye from Archangel, your Maje&s;ty, and your &s;ubjects, would not have had the many thou&s;ands you now po&s;&s;e&s;s. It is fit therefore, and proper, that you &s;hould grant me my reque&s;t." Mr. <HI>Brenkenhoff</HI> has im|ported large quantities of camels, and buffaloes, from A&s;ia;
<PB N="172" REF="212">
the latter of which, &s;eems to thrive very well, but camels do not &s;ucceed &s;o well. Rearing of &s;heep, and the culti|vation of tobacco, are next to the corn trade, the great re&s;ources of the country. Speculative farmers make a great quantity of coar&s;e &s;ilk; 12,000lb. of it are woven here annually.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Cities.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief cities belonging to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, are Koning&s;berg, Berlin, Potsdam, Bre&s;lau, and Dantzic. There are many others, but it would be endle&s;s to de&s;cribe them, and indeed to little purpo&s;e, as they con|tain nothing very curious.</P>
<P>The capital of the whole kingdom is Konning&s;berg; it is &s;ituated in N. Latitude, 54&deg;. 46. It is a fine large city, the rampart round which, is &s;even Engli&s;h miles, it has thirty-two ravelins and eight gates. This rampart in|clo&s;es &s;everal gardens, the large ca&s;tle, moat, and &s;ome meadows and fields. The whole circuit of the city, is above eight Engli&s;h miles; the number of hou&s;es about
<PB N="173" REF="213">
3800, Koning&s;berg properly con&s;i&s;ts of three towns, joined together, and of &s;everal &s;uburbs. One part of the town, which is the mo&s;t modern, &s;tands on an i&s;land, form|ed by the Pregel, and the buildings are erected upon piles of alder, which, by length of time, are become as hard as iron. In this part &s;tands the fine cathedral, in which is a famous organ, con&s;i&s;ting of 5000 pipes, and fini&s;hed in the year 1721.</P>
<P>The city is about the &s;ize of Copenhagen, has &s;everal palaces, and has &s;even bridges over the Pregel, (one of which con&s;i&s;ts of five arches, and is 160 feet long), and being &s;ituated at the mouth, where it di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Fri&s;che-Haf bay; and this bay opening it&s;elf into the Baltic &s;ea, it has a commodious port, and is a place of good trade. It lies about eighty miles ea&s;t of Dantzic, has a univer&s;ity, twenty-five churches, fourteen of which are Lutheran, and eleven Calvini&s;ts, and a Roman Catho|lic church; an academy of &s;ciences of fine arts and paint|ing, with public libraries, fine ho&s;pitals, and many public edifices, with hand&s;ome gardens; here is al&s;o a palace built in the form of an oblong &s;quare, and the area within is 136 paces long, and 75 broad. One &s;ide has apartments for the Royal family, and the three others, are appropriated for offices of &s;tate. In one corner of the quadrangle, is a tower, having 284 &s;teps to the top, which command a view of the whole city and country round. Here is a charitable fund, from which 800 indigent per&s;ons receive weekly pen&s;ions; be&s;ides tho&s;e who are &s;upported in alms-hou&s;es
<PB N="174" REF="214">
and ho&s;pitals. The city is lighted in the manner of Paris, with candles in lanthorns, hung on lines tied acro&s;s the &s;treets.</P>
<P>Koning&s;berg has always made a con&s;iderable figure in commerce, and &s;hipping, and was formerly one of the Hans-towns. Koning&s;berg contains 50,000 inhabitants, and 8000 &s;oldiers. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants are German Lutherans; but here is a &s;mall colony of French Calvi|ni&s;ts. The Poli&s;h and Lithuanian languages are here &s;poken.</P>
<P>The buildings are in a vile &s;tate, and mo&s;tly old; the city is a great collection of hou&s;es and &s;treets, without gance beauty or order; even our grammar &s;chools, are &s;uperior to their academies. Koning&s;berg has a con&s;ider|able trade in hemp and flax. It is &s;even German miles or thirty five Engli&s;h, from Palaw the &s;ea port, &s;o that only one &s;mall ve&s;&s;el can come up to the town. The ri|ver is very narrow here, but there are &s;ome very plea&s;ant gardens on its banks.</P>
<P>Berlin is in the marqui&s;ate of Brandenburg, plea&s;antly &s;ituated in a fruitful country, on the river Spree, having vineyards on one &s;ide, meadows on another, and a fore&s;t on the third, &s;tored with all manner of game. It lies in N. latitude 52&deg;. 30.14 degrees ea&s;t of London, and 45 miles we&s;t of Frankfort upon Oder. It is the capital of the marqui&s;ate, and the re&s;idence of the King. It is di|vided
<PB N="175" REF="215">
into two parts by the river, the north part of which is properly Berlin, the &s;outhern part is called Coln, where &s;tands the electoral palace, a magnificent, free &s;tone &s;truc|ture. The town is well built, and the &s;treets are remark|able large, wide, &s;pacious, and well paved, with plantations of trees. Frederick-&s;treet is two Engli&s;h miles and a half long; others, which go off at the right angles are a mile, or a mile and a half long. The &s;quares and public places are &s;pacious, the whole encompa&s;&s;ed with a wall, and a regular modern fortification. Canals being cut from this city, to the rivers Oder and Elbe, and the one falling into the Baltic, and the other into the German ocean, renders it one of the fir&s;t trading towns in Germany. It may be reckoned one of the cities in Europe. It has a few, very magnificent buildings; the re&s;t are neat hou&s;es, built with a fine white free-&s;tone, generally one, or at mo&s;t two &s;tories high; but the fini&s;hing within, does not cor|re&s;pond with the elegance of the out&s;ide. Soldiers being quartered in private hou&s;es, and are generally on the ground floor looking to the &s;treet, and there being at &s;ome times near 200,000 men, here in arms, the hou&s;es are ge|nerally full of them. Of the public edifices u&s;ually vi&s;ited by travellers, are the King's palace; that of his brothers; the ar&s;enal; the churches of Notra-Dame, St. Nicolas, St. Martin's, the Romi&s;h chapel, the opera hou&s;e, the eque&s;trian &s;tatue of <HI>Fredirick</HI> I. &amp;c. The front of the ar&s;inal, which forms one &s;ide of the palace, would be ex|tremely fine, but is loaded with ornament, &s;imilar to tho&s;e on the &s;creen of the prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s hou&s;e in Pall-Mall.
<PB N="176" REF="216">
The building is full of u&s;eful arms. The Romi&s;h chapel is a very plain, heavy doric edifice, with a cupola at top, and is by far the mo&s;t elegible place of wor&s;hip in the city, but has a very elegant portico. The opera hou&s;e, is a modern building, on a very grand &s;cale, &s;omething like the man&s;ion-hou&s;e in London, but with con&s;iderable more depth, It has this in&s;cription in front. FREDERICUS REX, APOLLINI ET MUSIS. The roof within is &s;upported by pillars, which makes it a fine &s;aloon, but they rather ob|&s;truct the &s;cenes. It has three galleries, and is reckoned to hold, 2000 per&s;ons. The orche&s;tre is paid by the King, and con&s;i&s;ts of fifty performers; indeed the whole expence of the opera is defrayed by the King. In the upper gal|leries, on each &s;ide of the &s;tage, are &s;ix trumpeters &s;eated, who &s;alute the Royal family on their entrance and going out, with martial mu&s;ic; but the late King, would not have this compliment paid to him. The eque&s;trian &s;tatue of <HI>Frederick</HI> I. is a fine performance. The hor&s;e is re|markably well executed, and there is great &s;pirit in the attitude of the figure. It &s;tands upon a pede&s;tal, with four human figures, as large as life, one at each corner. This &s;tatue &s;tands on the Pont Neuf, a new bridge built over the river Spree.</P>
<P>In the corner of one of the &s;quares, is a &s;tatue of Mar|&s;hal <HI>Schwenin,</HI> repre&s;ented, holding the en&s;ign, with which he advanced, at the famous battle of Prague. Perceiving his troops on the point of going, he &s;eized this from the officer's hands, who&s;e duty it was to carry it, and marched
<PB N="177" REF="217">
towards the enemy, calling out "Let all but cowards fol|low me." The troops a&s;hamed to abandon their general, charged once more, and turned the fortune of the day. But the brave old mar&s;hal was killed in the eighty-fourth year of his age.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of &s;aints and crucifixes, the late King intended, to ornament the churches of Berlin, with the portraits of men who had been u&s;eful to the &s;tate. Tho&s;e of the mar&s;hals <HI>Schwerin, Keith, Winterfield,</HI> and &s;ome others, are already placed in the great Lutheran church.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t fa&s;hionable walk in Berlin, is in the middle of one of the principal &s;treets. Before the hou&s;es on each &s;ide, there is a cau&s;way, and between the&s;e two cau&s;eways are fine gravel walks planted with lime-trees. Tents are pitched under the&s;e, and ice, lemonade, and other refre&s;h|ments &s;old. The regimental mu&s;ic practice here, in the &s;ummer, and the company often walk in the evening till it is very late.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers here in garri&s;on, are generally pretty quiet, and the police of the town is tolerably well regulated; but, there are &s;ome kind of irregularities &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> that pre|vail in the highe&s;t degree. Public courtezans are more numerous than in any other town in Europe, in proportion to the number of inhabitants. They appear openly at the windows in the day time, beckon to pa&s;&s;engers as they walk in the &s;treets, and ply for employment, in any way
<PB N="178" REF="218">
they plea&s;e without di&s;turbance from the magi&s;trate. It &s;eems to be a received opinion here, that the peace and happine&s;s of the community, are not interrupted by this &s;pecies of licentiou&s;ne&s;s; therefore no one is allowed to mole&s;t or abu&s;e tho&s;e who have cho&s;en this way of life for a profe&s;&s;ion; and, as little attention is paid to tho&s;e who frequent the chambers of the&s;e ladies, as if they &s;tept into any other hou&s;e or &s;hop, to purcha&s;e any other com|modity.</P>
<P>Another &s;pecies of debauchery is &s;aid al&s;o to prevail in this capital, but Dr. <HI>Moore</HI> imagines what is &s;aid of it, is much exaggerated.</P>
<P>The better kind of citizens and manufacturers, live in|tirely among tho&s;e of their own rank, and without affec|ting the manners of the courtiers, or &s;tooping to the mean debauchery of the commonalty, maintain the decency, plainne&s;s, and mode&s;ty of the German church.</P>
<P>The &s;ociety into which &s;trangers may be admitted, in this capital, is not various or exten&s;ive. The Pru&s;&s;ian officers of the higher ranks, who&s;e time is not intirely engro&s;&s;ed, like that of their inferiors, by the duties of their profe&s;&s;ion, live mo&s;tly with their own families, or with each other. The late king did not approve of their forming intimacies with foreign mini&s;ters, or with &s;tran|gers.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="219">The entrance into Berlin, is airy and elegant; the &s;treets are regular and clean, and the hou&s;es uniform. The number of inhabitants, are reckoned at 100,000, and there are from 12,000, to 30,000 men, always in garri|&s;on. The palace is the fir&s;t object that &s;trikes the eye of the traveller; but one of the &s;quare &s;ides is an old build|ing, and the wall of the grand front, being &s;even or eight feet thick, the rooms within do not receive &s;ufficient light from the windows, to &s;hew them to advantage. When <HI>Hanway</HI> was there in 1750, the apartments in the palace, were adorned with &s;ilver, in every &s;hape; and &s;o ma&s;&s;ive, that the fa&s;hion of it came to no more than &s;even per cent. &s;o that 4,000,000, of dollars might be realized on any emergency; but <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> tells us, that when he was there twenty years afterwards, the late King had melt|ed down the greate&s;t part of it, for the war expences, and that very little of it was re&s;tored. Here are pictures of <HI>Charles</HI> V. and his Empre&s;s, the frames of which are &s;il|ver, and weighed 660lb. each, and a grand crown lu&s;tre, that weighed near a ton weight; al&s;o a mu&s;ic gallery in &s;ilver, and &s;o on: but <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> &s;ays, when he was there in 1760, mo&s;t of the furniture for a royal palace, was very mean. There are &s;ome fine pictures, and &s;everal of <HI>Bar|berini,</HI> the celebrated female dancer. The throne in the audience chamber is velvet embroidered with gold, in a grand ta&s;te, but there is nothing extraordinary otherwi&s;e, but a bed of crim&s;on, and a clock, which has 200 cy|phers with electroral crowns, all &s;et with pearls, and the rooms, are in the &s;ame ta&s;te. In this bed it is u&s;ual to
<PB N="180" REF="220">
lodge per&s;ons of the blood royal on their marriage nights.</P>
<P>The King's, library, would be deemed a mean apart|ment for a common &s;chool. It is open to the public certain hours in the day. Here is a collection of 500 bi|bles, of different languages and editions. Here is the fir&s;t bible printed in America; one printed in 1450; the fir&s;t printed in the German language, and the identical bible which <HI>Charles</HI> I. of England, u&s;ed when he was beheaded; and pre&s;ented to the elector of Brandenburg, by Doctor <HI>Juxlen.</HI></P>
<P>The cabinet of curio&s;ites, has among other things, two cannon balls, which meeting in the air, the warmth of the iron, (or perhaps being made red hot) with the violence of the motion, united them together. An oak with &s;tags horns. The &s;tag having been hunted with great violence, ran his horns into a young tree, and there expired; and the tree growing, the horns at length appeared, as a natural production.</P>
<P>In 1750 the late King, was preparing &s;everal amu&s;e|ments, for the entertainment of <HI>Frederick</HI> marquis of <HI>Bar|rille,</HI> who married his elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of which was the carnival, and the expences amounted to 70,000 crowns. This entertainment con&s;i&s;ted of qua|drilles, or four companies, in the dre&s;&s;es of Romans, Car|pathians, Grecians and Per&s;ians; all mounted on hor&s;es
<PB N="181" REF="221">
richly capari&s;oned, in the &s;ame manner; each party being compo&s;ed of &s;ix combatants. The fir&s;t was con|ducted by the prince of Pru&s;&s;ia; the other three, by his two brothers, and the marquis, the King's cou&s;in. They had al&s;o the arms of the &s;everal nations, and were followed each by a band of mu&s;ic, proper to the re&s;pective coun|tries; and habited and attended, after the &s;ame manner. The proce&s;&s;ion of the whole, made a &s;plendid &s;hew; but to Mr. <HI>Hanway,</HI> who was pre&s;ent, it was only of a thea|trical kind, for he &s;aw but little of the pride and beauty of hor&s;es or hor&s;eman&s;hip, nor was the area alotted for the entertainment, half large enough. What rendered the fir&s;t trial ridiculous, was, its being exhibited by the light of lamps, the greater part of which, was blown out by the wind. However, the next exhibition, of the&s;e tilts and tournaments, was in broad day; and the prizes were allotted to tho&s;e who were judged to perform be&s;t; without any other blood&s;hed, than that of one of the princes cutting his toe with his own &s;word.</P>
<P>A mock battle was afterwards fought, which was in|comparably a more grand entertainment. Four thou&s;and men being marched out in the morning early, about a German mile from the city, near the village Britz, were followed by another detachment, of the &s;ame number. The hu&s;&s;ars and cuira&s;&s;iers had &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes in the way. Both armies plied their field artillery warmly; at length a rivulet was pa&s;&s;ed, a wood was attacked, and the enemy driven from it to a village, which was carried &s;word in hand. After this, they went through all the various
<PB N="182" REF="222">
evolutions, and exerci&s;es, of both cavalry and infantry, as might be &s;uppo&s;ed in a real engagement, changing their po&s;ition, on a tract of about two Engli&s;h miles, during the &s;pace of three hours. At this &s;how almo&s;t the whole city of Berlin was pre&s;ent. There are &s;ometimes reviews here of 30,000 men, and there manoeuvres will continue three days. Dr. <HI>Moore</HI> was at one of the&s;e.</P>
<P>Berlin, by &s;trangers, has been called a little Paris, the French language, being almo&s;t as well under&s;tood, as the German. The city abounds in elegant &s;tructures, and is computed near one third as large as London, yet not con|taining above one eighth part of the inhabitants; from whence it may ea&s;ily be accounted, why gra&s;s is found growing in many of their capital &s;treets. The whole of this city, be&s;peaks but little variety. It is about four miles and a half long, and about three miles broad; but within this inclo&s;ure, are many gardens, and &s;ome fields, but not more than 6000 hou&s;es, whereas in Paris, there are near 30,000. The emptine&s;s of many places, is a &s;ingular contra&s;t to the magnificence of the buildings; nor is the contra&s;t of this magnificence, with the circum&s;tances of the people, le&s;s &s;triking. Whil&s;t you are gazing at the beauty of a build|ing, in the fir&s;t &s;tyle of architecture, finely &s;tuccoed, with a magnificent front, and all the outward appearance of a ducal re&s;idence; on a &s;udden, a window &s;hall open on the lower &s;tory, and a cobler &s;hall bring out a pair of boots, and hang them up under your no&s;e, to dry the leather.

<P><HI>Rie&s;bec,</HI> tells us, that the inns throughout Berlin, are little better than the bignios in London; that they keep li&s;ts of ladies in their neighbourhood, who are &s;eated ac|cording to their prices; and that a &s;ervant is always wait|ing at hand to fetch them.

<P>Potsdam is a fine well built city, where the King has a palace, and has finer hou&s;es than tho&s;e at Berlin, built with free-&s;tone, but are inhabited only as at Berlin, by per|&s;ons of lower rank. It is &s;eated on an i&s;land formed by the Havel, and &s;ome neighbouring lakes, and is about four German miles in circuit. Here is a fine canal of fifty paces wide, and 2000 in length cut from the Havel through the centre of the town, to a branch again of the &s;ame river. This canal is planted, on both &s;ides, with trees, and &s;urrounded with well built hou&s;es. Before the pa|lace which was originally a ca&s;tle, is a large &s;quare, adorned with Roman columns, in which the garri&s;on is daily exerci&s;ed. The plea&s;ure gardens adjoining, are beautifully laid out, and ornamented with water-works, gildings and &s;tatues. In the market-place is erected a pyramid or obeli&s;k of four &s;ides, compo&s;ed of variegated Sile&s;ian marble, &s;eventy-five feet high. On each &s;ide is a marble bu&s;t of the Kings from <HI>Frederick</HI> I. to <HI>Frederick</HI> II. The pede&s;tal is of white Italian marble, and at each cor|ner, a &s;mall &s;tatute of the &s;ame. Here is a velvet and &s;ilk manufactory. The palace is not large but elegant. The King's &s;tudy is partitioned off by ballu&s;trades of &s;ilver, and the frames of the looking-gla&s;&s;es and tables, are of the &s;ame metal. The throne in the audience chamber is mag|nificently adorned with a rich embroidery, of the arms of

the hou&s;e of Brandenburg. In one of the apartments, are two curious figures in copper, of a Chine&s;e man &s;itting, and a Chine&s;e woman, holding an umbrella over him; the whole richly gilt, &s;tanding in an oval niche, inlaid with marble. The&s;e two figures form a very convenient &s;tove. The &s;tair-ca&s;e, and grand &s;aloon, are lined with Sile&s;ian marble.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who &s;hewed the palace, when Dr. <HI>Moore</HI> was at Potsdam, in the late King's reign; a&s;ked him, if he had any de&s;ire to &s;ee the King's wardrobe. This con&s;i&s;ted, of two blue coats, faced with red, the lining of one, a lit|tle torn; two yellow wai&s;tcoats, a good deal &s;oiled with Spani&s;h &s;nuff; three pair of yellow breeches, and a &s;uit of velvet, embroidered with gold for grand occa&s;ions. The velvet &s;uit he had had ten years, and was in good condi|tion.</P>
<P>As I have given a drawing, of <HI>Frederick</HI> II. in his &s;tudy with Voltaire, and the likene&s;s of both is wonderfully pre|&s;erved, it may not be ami&s;s to de&s;cribe his dre&s;s, which is &s;eldom ob&s;erved. It con&s;i&s;ted of a blue coat lined and faced with red, and yellow wai&s;tcoat and breeches. He always wore boots with hu&s;&s;ar tops, which fell in wrinkles about his ancles, and were oftener brown than black.</P>
<P>His hat would be thought extraordinary large in Eng|and, though it is of the &s;ize commonly worn by the Ru&s;|&s;ian officers of cavalry. He generally wore one of the
<PB N="186" REF="227">
large &s;ide corners on his forehead and eyes, and the front cock at one &s;ide. His hair was alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cued behind, and dre&s;&s;ed on each &s;ide with a &s;ingle curl, and &s;eldom was it well dre&s;&s;ed. He had con&s;tantly in his hand a very large gold &s;nuff-box, ornamented with diamonds, and took an immoderate quantity of Spani&s;h &s;nuff, which was &s;cattered about his wai&s;tcoat and breeches; and the&s;e were often marked with the paws of two or three Italian grey-hounds, which he frequently care&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the old chamber, where the late King died, at the lower part of the window, which looks into the garden, four panes have been removed, and a piece of gla&s;s, equal in &s;ize with the four, &s;upplies its place. The King's ex|treme delight through life, had been to &s;ee his troops ex|erci&s;e, and he retained this pa&s;&s;ion till his la&s;t breath. When he was confined to his room, by his la&s;t illne&s;s, he u&s;ed to &s;it and view them through the window, which had been thus formed for the purpo&s;e. Becoming gradually weaker by his increa&s;ing di&s;order, he could not &s;it, but was obliged to lie on a couch the whole day. When at any time, he was uncommonly languid, his head was rai&s;ed to the window, and a &s;ight of the men under arms, was per|ceived to operate like a cordial, and recover his &s;pirits. By frequent repetition, however, even this lo&s;t its effect; his eyes became dim; when his head was rai&s;ed, he could no longer perceive the &s;oldiers, and he expired. This was feeling the ruling pa&s;&s;ion as &s;trong in death, as any man ever felt it!</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="228">In the garden are many rich &s;tatues of a great &s;ize, par|ticularly a Neptune and Amphitrite, erected on a &s;ea-car, in a large ba&s;on, oppo&s;ite the ea&s;t front of the palace. The &s;tables are adjoining, and are well furni&s;hed with good Engli&s;h hunters. Near the town is a number of vine|yards.</P>
<P>Towns, generally, are formed by degrees, as the inha|bitants increa&s;e in number; and hou&s;es are built larger, and more commodious, as they increa&s;e in wealth. But here the matter is rever&s;ed. The hou&s;es are built fir&s;t, and beautifully &s;o, to entice the people; but notwith&s;tand|ing this, few towns are wor&s;e inhabited, though the hou&s;es are let to merchants and trade&s;men, at low rents. The hou&s;es here are chiefly uniform, all new, and of one height; &s;everal &s;treets have been built at once, at the King's ex|pence. The &s;treets are regular and well paved, and here are &s;ome magnificent public buildings. Thus externally Pot&s;dam wears a re&s;pectable appearance, but it is internally, like the hou&s;es at Berlin. The fini&s;hing of the buildings, furniture and conveniencies are poor indeed!</P>
<P>At Pot&s;dam are quartered the King's guards, who are about 2000 men, of great &s;tature and comline&s;s, well cloathed, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ilver-laced hats, and black cockades.</P>
<P>About an Engli&s;h mile from Pot&s;dam, is the palace of Sans-Souci, which pre&s;ents the eye with a remarkable fine
<PB N="188" REF="229">
pro&s;pect. It is built on the top of a de&s;olate mountain, with great ta&s;te both within and without. The offices are at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and are joined to the body of the palace (now completely fini&s;hed,) by a double colo|nade, which has a grand effect. The front of the palace &s;eems rather crowded, by a great number of &s;tatues, de|&s;igned to ornament it, the&s;e are chiefly in groups, repre|&s;enting &s;ome &s;tory from Ovid. This mountain is cut into &s;ix terraces, to each of which we a&s;cend by twelve &s;teps, and again&s;t the walls on each terrace, are planted the be&s;t vines, and are kept under gla&s;s ca&s;es. On the upper part of the mountain, which affords an agreeable view of the town and its vicinage, &s;tands the palace, it is &s;mall and only one &s;tory high, yet, on account of its regularity, elegance, and ornaments, con&s;i&s;ting of the greate&s;t ma&s;ter-pieces in &s;culpture, painting, and other arts, is admirable. The &s;ta|tues from the cabinet of antiquites, formerly in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Cardinal <HI>Polignac,</HI> are depo&s;ited here. In the centre of this palace, is a round hall, lined with marble, who&s;e magnificent columns, excellent paintings, and beautiful marble-floor, di&s;po&s;ed in the form of flowers, in the Floren|tine manner, &s;trikes the eye very agreeably. On the top is a cupola that gives it light, terminated by a large crown, &s;upported by the three graces. One of the apartments in the palace is wain&s;coted with cedar, and ornamented with flowers of gold, and here is a &s;mall library. Behind the palace is a &s;emicircular pa&s;&s;age, adorned on each &s;ide with columns, and three &s;ides of the whole is &s;urrounded with fine gardens, but which have nothing extraordinary, except
<PB N="189" REF="230">
&s;ome fine pieces of &s;tatuary, done by <HI>Nancie</HI> of Paris, par|ticularly Venus drawing a net, and Diana with game; the pede&s;tals of which are in relievo. The garden is about half an Engli&s;h mile in length, terminated by an Egyptian pyramid. Here is very little turf and no gravel, the &s;andy walks robbing the place of half its beauty. What it wants in beauty, however, is made up in re&s;pect, for no one in the late King's life, was &s;uffered to walk in it with a &s;word on, on any pretence; nor did the King him&s;elf ever wear one in that retreat.</P>
<P>Pot&s;dam was the favourite re&s;idence of the late king, where he avoided the empty ceremonies of a court, and where he &s;at down to table with twelve per&s;ons, inviting even his en&s;igns in rotation. His bed, at Sans-Souci, was in a &s;mall niche, con&s;i&s;ting only of two matra&s;&s;es, under the cover of a down quilt, without the lea&s;t common orna|ment, or mark of grandeur.</P>
<P>Dantzic is a famous commercial city and &s;ortre&s;s, &s;itua|ted on the Vi&s;tula, about five miles from the Baltic. It is a &s;ea port town, and has two &s;mall rivers running through it. It is a large, populous, and beautiful city, one of the Han&s;e-towns, and built according to the ancient manner of tho&s;e towns: but mo&s;t of the &s;treets are nar|row, owing to the galleries of the hou&s;es, by which we enter them, projecting ten or twelve feet into the &s;treets. To the&s;e galleries there is an a&s;cent by a foot&s;tep; they
<PB N="190" REF="231">
&s;tand even with the hou&s;es, and under mo&s;t of them are good vaults, or cellars.</P>
<P>The city has a beautiful harbour, carries on a con&s;ide|rable trade, e&s;pecially in corn. The &s;hips belonging to this port are very numerous, and the privileges of the city are of great importance. As the third great city, it &s;ends repre|&s;entatives to the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;enate, or council of &s;tate, who have likewi&s;e a &s;eat in the general diet of Poland, and vote at the election of a king of Poland. It has al&s;o the privilege of coining money, gathering amber, &amp;c. This place was &s;ubject to the crown of Poland, as was al&s;o the city of Thorn; but the late king of Pru&s;&s;ia, by no other right than what a powerful army confers on every tyrant, &s;eized upon them, with the countries on the Vi&s;tula, the Nie&s;ter, and other territories contiguous to his own dominions.</P>
<P>The chief burghers, of which there are one hundred, are &s;tiled nobles, and the city was anciently the principal of the Han&s;e-towns, being one of the fir&s;t that entered into, that a&s;&s;ociation. It was a con&s;iderable place in 997. It has its own garri&s;on, and the fortifications make a good appearance; e&s;pecially towards the South and We&s;t, which parts are &s;urrounded with mountains and eminences; &s;ome of the&s;e hills being higher than the city towers.</P>
<P>According to the bills of mortality, in 1752, 1846 per&s;ons died here. In the &s;ame year, 1288 Poli&s;h
<PB N="191" REF="232">
ve&s;&s;els, &s;mall and great, from the Vi&s;tula, and 1014 &s;hips from the &s;ea arrived at this port, and 58,060 la&s;ts of corn were brought here for exportation. This will give &s;ome idea of its population and commerce.</P>
<P>In this city are twelve Lutheran churches, two Calvini&s;|tic churches, and one Papi&s;t church. The inhabitants are chiefly Prote&s;tants, yet the city &s;tanding in the papi&s;t dio|ce&s;e of Cujaira, is &s;ubject to pay pecuniary impo&s;itions, upon every frivolous pretence. One of the churches is a Lutheran cathedral, and the fir&s;t preacher is called <HI>&s;enior Mini&s;terii;</HI> the re&s;t are equal in dignity, but two of them mu&s;t be doctors in divinity. Here is al&s;o a Lutheran academy, with &s;even profe&s;&s;ors, and one teacher of the Poli&s;h language; though this language is but little u&s;ed, the inhabitants chiefly &s;peaking German. There is an open library, &s;ome publick buildings, and a remarkable water-mill on the river Radaune, with eighteen wheels, which is &s;aid to bring in the proprietors ten &s;hillings every hour. Without the walls of the city are a number of &s;mall towns belonging to it, and a territory between twelve and fifteen miles round. One of the&s;e towns, is that of Oliva, &s;o celebrated for the peace concluded in it. Here is an abbey and a convent. The peace I allude to, was between the Emperor, and the kings of Poland and Swe|den. <HI>Charles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vus,</HI> king of Sweden, dying during the ratification, all the great conque&s;ts made by him, were re&s;tored to the crown of Poland: the particulars of this peace, which happened in the year 1617, are engraved on
<PB N="192" REF="233">
a black marble monument. The Abbot's revenues amoun|ted to &pound;5,000 a year, but the king of Pru&s;&s;ia be&s;ieged the whole, and allotted him a pen&s;ion, for life of 550l. and about a fourth of that &s;um to keep his fine garden in order. <HI>Wraxhall</HI> tells us, on inconte&s;tible authority, that the King confi&s;cated the e&s;tates of a great number, of Poli&s;h nobles, and reduced their families from a revenue of 100,000 ducats, each ducat, nine &s;hillings and three pence, Engli&s;h, to ab&s;olute indigence. The city was crouded with Poli&s;h nobility, who on that &s;ei&s;ure of territory, abandoned their torn and bleeding country, to take refuge in it; but the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, having threatened to &s;eize all their e&s;tates, unle&s;s they returned; they were under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of complying.</P>
<P>In the great church at Dantzic, is a va&s;t pillar hollow|ed, which they &s;ay was anciently u&s;ed to immure eccle|&s;ia&s;tics, guilty of heinous crimes. They let per&s;ons down into it, by a rope, and it is forty feet deep; the &s;quare dimen&s;ions within, about &s;even feet.</P>
<P>Dantzic, though much &s;uperior to Koning&s;berg, is nei|ther elegant, nor hand&s;ome, it very much re&s;embles Hamburgh, both in the loftine&s;s of the hou&s;es, the man|ner of building them, and the narrowne&s;s of the &s;treets; they are however much cleaner than any other in this part of the world, but its neatne&s;s is not carried to that length it is in Holland. The principal &s;treets are plant|ed on each &s;ide in the Dutch way with wild che&s;nuts, about
<PB N="193" REF="234">
thirty feet high; the city is not large, not exceeding three miles in circuit, but fortified with a wall and double ditch. Two thou&s;and &s;oldiers would be &s;carce &s;ufficient to garri&s;on this place, but they have not 700 men, and tho&s;e neither in di&s;cipline, arms, or ammunition, equal to the &s;ame number of any regular, European forces.</P>
<P>Dantzic, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> has &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t no one but the Poles. They have an ar&s;enal full of u&s;eful arms, and they talk of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing two or three hundred pieces of cannon, but a great train of artillery may be as in&s;ignificant, as the&s;e at Dantzic are, and be con&s;idered as a magazine of match-locks.</P>
<P>The commerce of this place, is the only &s;ubject worth attention, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing as they &s;ay, &s;ixteen parts out of twen|ty of all the trade of Poland, owing to the river Vi&s;|tula, and all its branches, which &s;pread through a va&s;t extent of that kingdom, and are navigable almo&s;t where ever they go. They export, wheat &s;ome years, to the amount, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> of five, &s;ix, or 700,000 pounds; and once, the amount ro&s;e to 1,240,000l. but &s;ince the troubles of Poland, the trade has much declined. All the corn comes in &s;loops, and flat-bottomed barges, car|rying from thirty, to &s;ixty tons and more, and wholly on account of the landlords, who are all nobles, in virtue of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing lands. It is rai&s;ed on their e&s;tates, by their pea&s;ants. The barges are their own, and the wa|termen are their own va&s;&s;als. It is &s;old to merchants at Dantzic, who lodge it in granaries built for the purpo&s;e,
<PB N="194" REF="235">
&s;even, or eight &s;tories high. Their boats carry back to their owners, all the commodities and manufactures they have occa&s;ion for. Iron from Sweden, Ea&s;t-India goods &s;upplied by the Dutch, brandy, limes, and We&s;t-India commodities, by the French. The trade of England with Dantzic, is very incon&s;iderable, owing to our not tak|ing off any part of her commodities.</P>
<P><HI>Hanway</HI> &s;ays, the inhabitants of Dantzic are much more agreeable than the place it&s;elf. The women are much like the Engli&s;h in their &s;tature, countenance and air, they have the reputation of being hand&s;ome, and indeed are &s;o; the bad ones make a market of their beauty, in the wor&s;t manner, in the neighbouring empires, where they are remarkably eminent in a profe&s;&s;ion, which is apt to convert beauty into deformity, and health into di&s;ea&s;e. Women of di&s;tinction, affect the manner of the Poles, &s;o that the mo&s;t re&s;pectful way of &s;aluting a lady, is to ki&s;s her hand, unle&s;s you chu&s;e to &s;toop, as do the Poles, to the hem of her petticoat.</P>
<P>There is an Engli&s;h factory here. Within the double works, which defend the town, is a &s;pacious walk, and a road for coaches. In the outer part is a hillock, under which are depo&s;ited the bodies of near 5000 Ru&s;&s;ians, who, in one morning, fell by an ob&s;tinate attack, com|manded by Count <HI>Munich.</HI> The Dantzickers, in 1734, having e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> king of Poland, in his conte&s;t with <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> elector of Saxony, procu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed

the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of 10,000 Troops. The Ru&s;&s;ians, under the command of Count <HI>Munich,</HI> made a de&s;perate and inju|dicious attack upon the Dantzickers, and were cut to pieces.</P>
<P>The ancient city of Magdeburg, is &s;ituated in 52 deg&punc; odd min. n. lat. and 70 miles we&s;t of Berlin; it is the capital of the duchy of that name, the &s;eat of the provincial regen|cy, the con&s;i&s;tory, the war and deme&s;ne office, and one of the mo&s;t principal trading towns in all Germany; it lies on the river Elbe, is &s;trongly fortified, and among other works has a citadel in the i&s;land of the river.</P>
<P>Magdeburg is well built, particularly the broad &s;treet, which makes a grand appearance, though the principal beauty of the town, con&s;i&s;ts in its cathedral-&s;quare orna|mented with large elegant hou&s;es, and its area well paved. Among the mo&s;t remarkable edifices here, are the King's palace, which was anciently the re&s;idence of the bi&s;hops, and is now converted into public offices. The Lu|theran cathedral here, is a &s;uperb &s;tructure in the antique ta&s;te; it was fini&s;hed in the year 1323, is two hundred and eight ells long, the &s;ame in height, and fifty-five ells broad; it is wholly built of free-&s;tone, and contains many curio&s;ities &s;uch as a &s;tone, ba&s;&s;o-relievo of the wi&s;e and fool|i&s;h virgins, the former &s;miling, and the latter di&s;con&s;olate; a number of relics not much regarded; an altar, with a ta|ble of ja&s;per, eighteen feet long, two thick, and eight broad, valued at two tons of gold; a porphyry font, a large

&s;tone &s;aid to be one of the water-pots, in which our <HI>Sa|viour,</HI> turned water into wine; an old wooden &s;lipper of the Virgin Mary's; a piece of wood, on which the cock &s;tood, that crowed on <HI>Peter's</HI> denying our Saviour; the ba&s;on <HI>Pilate</HI> wa&s;hed his hands in, and many others.</P>
<P>Magdeburg has, from time immemorial, enjoyed the &s;taple: in this town is al&s;o a variety of manufactures, woollen cloths, &s;tuffs, cottons, linens, &s;tockings, hats, beautiful leather-gloves, tobacco, &s;nuff, &amp;c. being very advantageous to trade, from its communication with Hamburgh by the Elbe, and lying on the road, between upper and lower Germany. It is the &s;tronge&s;t place, be|longing to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and where his principal magazines and founderies are e&s;tabli&s;hed. In time of war it is the repo&s;itory of whatever he finds nece&s;&s;ary to place out of the reach of &s;udden attack. The country between Magdeburg, and Brandenburg, within two leagues of the former, is well cultivated and fertile, but at a greater di&s;tance, it is as naked and &s;andy as the de&s;arts of Arabia.</P>

<P>WHEN the late king came to the crown, his own ter|ritories contained at lea&s;t 2,200,000 inhabitants; Brandenburg had 600,000, Pru&s;&s;ia, 60,000 Pomerania, 300,000, Magdeburg and Halber&s;tadt, 300,000, and his We&s;tphalian dominions at lea&s;t, 400,000. His in|come con&s;i&s;ted of at lea&s;t, 12,000,000 of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lorins.</P>
<P>As the Pru&s;&s;ian population does not bear any propor|tion to the &s;ize of the country, and as that is not yet all cultivated, the number of people is &s;u&s;ceptible of a great increa&s;e. The King's own revenue now is about 30 mil|lions of florins, that is about 370,833l. Engli&s;h. His civil li&s;t is incredibly &s;mall, and his fir&s;t mini&s;ters appointments are only, 15,000 florins.</P>
<P><HI>Rie&s;bec</HI> &s;ays, he has ob&s;erved no where, throughout the whole Pru&s;&s;ian dominions, &s;o much poverty as in the two cities of Berlin and Pot&s;dam. The high price of the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life in the&s;e places, the great number of idle people, the &s;mall pay of many civil and military &s;ervants, the pinching way in which many of the &s;maller nobility live, who mu&s;t have their &s;ervants, and the great luxury of dre&s;s, may be the cau&s;es of it. The equal di&s;tribu|tion of the coin among many people, makes the &s;um not &s;o &s;triking, as it is in other places, in which a nobleman
<PB N="199" REF="240">
ruins the property of a hundred of his poor countrymen by his di&s;&s;ipation, There are no per&s;ons in the Pru&s;&s;ian do|minions, &s;ome of the large nobles in Sile&s;ia only except|ed, who po&s;&s;e&s;s above 30,000 guilders income, in landed e&s;tates. Indeed we cannot find more than three hou&s;es, which have 20,000 florins, but &s;till the inhabitants are as remote from extreme poverty, as from exce&s;&s;ive riches, and there are as few beggars here, as in any other country in Europe.</P>
<P>Since the year 1719, it is computed that 24,000 colo|ni&s;ts have &s;ettled here, emigrants from Germany, France, and Switzerland, and the&s;e Coloni&s;ts, in Little Lithuania, have erected, four hundred villages, eleven towns, eighty-&s;ix &s;eats, and fifty new churches.</P>
<P>The Pru&s;&s;ian nobility are mo&s;tly de&s;cended from the an|cient Germans, and mo&s;t of the pea&s;ants are va&s;&s;als either to the king, or the nobles.</P>
<P>The cu&s;toms and manners of the people are &s;o &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Germans in general, that as we &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion to &s;peak of them hereafter, it will be needle&s;s to enter on them here at large. I will only mention a few particulars.</P>
<P>On entering the Pru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on towns, you are &s;top|ped at the gate; the officer of the guard a&s;ks your name, whence you came, and where you are going, and takes it down in writing. When the title of Duke, is given in as
<PB N="200" REF="241">
the name, the guard is turned out under arms, not &s;o for my Lord, being a title treated with very little ceremony either in France or Germany, and often a&s;&s;umed by tho&s;e who have no right to it, and given to every Engli&s;hman, of a decent appearance. But Duke, in Germany, implies a &s;overeign, and is more re&s;pectable than Prince.</P>
<P>The French manners and turn of thinking, prevail ve|ry little among the Pru&s;&s;ian officers, but the ladies of the court of Berlin, have greatly the air of the French. Though the late king could not endure the company of a woman, the ladies here, are by no means neglected by the men in general. Many of the married women parti|cularly, have a crowd of admirers who attend them upon all occa&s;ions, are invited with them to all enter|tainments, &s;it next them at table, and whom the ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, takes care to place toge|ther, at the &s;ame card-table. When a lady is not pro|vided with an attendant of this kind, her hu&s;band, as well as her&s;elf, is generally a little out of countenance, and both &s;eem rather in an awkward &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In this country, when both parties are willing, and there are no children, a divorce may be obtained with ve|ry little trouble or expence, and we are frequently in com|pany, where a lady, her pre&s;ent and former hu&s;band are at table, and all parties behave in the mo&s;t polite and friendly manner to each other.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Moore</HI> tells a plea&s;ant, &s;tory of a gentleman, who
<PB N="201" REF="242">
having lived in a &s;tate of dome&s;tic jarring with his wife, got her per&s;waded to concur with him, in applying for a divorce. It was &s;oon obtained. He married again, a woman with whom he was violently in love; and ex|pected, as u&s;ual, endle&s;s happine&s;s. After marriage this pa&s;&s;ion cooled rather &s;ooner than common, and within a few months he became the profe&s;&s;ed admirer of his fir&s;t wife. He now &s;aw a thou&s;and charms in her per&s;on and conver&s;ation, which had entirely e&s;caped his notice, whil&s;t the bonds of wedlock &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. He al&s;o di&s;cerned that certain peculiarities in her manner, which he formerly thought exceedingly aukward, were in reality graceful. He expre&s;&s;ed his remor&s;e for his former blindne&s;s, in the mo&s;t pathetic terms; the lady was &s;oftened and at la&s;t gave the mo&s;t perfect marks of forgivene&s;s, and it was univer&s;ally thought, that he thus contrived to live in adultery, with the very woman, to whom he had been lawfully married.</P>
<P>Here jealou&s;y is held in equal contempt, and dete&s;ta|tion, and &s;candal is very little known. People &s;eem &s;o fully occupied with their own private affairs, that they &s;eldom trouble their heads about the bu&s;ine&s;s of their neighbours. If, in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, an inti|macy of a particular kind is hinted at, between people of different &s;exes, it is mentioned accidently as a fact of no importance, and without the &s;malle&s;t blame, or ill-natured reflections on either of the parties. One rea&s;on of this may be, that there is &s;carce &s;uch a thing as an old maid, throughout all Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="243">Some of the amu&s;ements of Berlin, I have men|tioned, but none delighted <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> more, than the park|walks on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Sprey, I have never yet, &s;ays he, &s;een a finer public walk: the varied beauties of the woods, alleys, groves, and wilderne&s;s, beggar all de&s;cription. It is above three miles round and has water &s;ufficient to give more life than there is in the walks of much larger cities.</P>
<P>In this park, on a Sunday, you &s;ee Berlin in all its glory. It is to the people of this place, what St. James park is to London, and the Thuilleries to Paris, only the mixture of the company is much more &s;triking, as you find all the populace, and all the great world here. You ride or walk through, without any mole&s;tation. In &s;ome parts of the park, you &s;ee rows of ladies magnificently dre&s;&s;ed, &s;itting together, and have the freedom of &s;taring them full in the face, and comparing them to one another: you al&s;o meet with mo&s;t of the literati of the place, at &s;tated times, and there are refre&s;hments of every kind provided.</P>
<P>The opera is open only in winter, and it is reckoned one of the be&s;t in Europe, but there is no theatre, except an indifferent German one. The manager &s;eems to have &s;ome very &s;ingular opinions. He places the &s;trength of his company in the number of his actors, and appears to di&s;tribute the parts among them by lot. Among fifty performers there is &s;carce a tolerable one, and his wardrobe
<PB N="203" REF="244">
is of a piece with the re&s;t. Ab&s;urdity upon ab&s;urdity; the theatre is &s;o &s;mall that the &s;pectators are obliged to take care that the clouds above them do not entangle with their hair; trees are &s;carce big enough for walking &s;ticks, and &s;o poverty-&s;truck are the players, that they are &s;carce able to move their hands or arms, the &s;alaries paid them not being more than from 6 or 8 guilders a week; le&s;s pay than our &s;trolling companies, are not calculated to give them &s;trength. Their forte con&s;equently con&s;i&s;ts in fainting away, which is only excelled by them&s;elves in their dying. Dying is the principal excellence of a German actor, and when he knows how to give life to his death, by beginning the convul&s;ions in his feet, he is &s;ure of the applau&s;e of a German pit.</P>
<P>Though the inhabitants of Berlin, including the Ger|man are about 142,000 per&s;ons, it is not able to keep up a good company of players. This is entirely owing to want of &s;pirit in the manager, who &s;uffers half his company to &s;tarve, and plays in a building, which, in any other city, would be looked on as a barn.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction between the Pru&s;&s;ian and the Au&s;trian character, is not more manife&s;t than in their theatres. Two companies of comedians can &s;carce find exi&s;tence through|out all the fine cities of Pru&s;&s;ia; whereas in Au&s;tria, there is a theatre in every &s;mall town. This difference is not owing to difference of fortunes, for there is much more money in Pru&s;&s;ia then in Au&s;tria, though no &s;ingle hou&s;e
<PB N="204" REF="245">
in the former has an income of 50,100, or even 200,000 guilders. There is an appearance of care amid the mid|dle cla&s;&s;es of the inhabitants of the Pru&s;&s;ian towns, which is not &s;een through Au&s;tria, The only difference con&s;i&s;ts in the greater indu&s;try of the Pru&s;&s;ians and the frugality in&s;eparable from it. The knowledge and manners found among the inhabitants of the Pru&s;&s;ian provinces put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of better plea&s;ures, then are to be met with in the theatre, the dancing-booth and the cellar. In the &s;malle&s;t Pru&s;&s;ian villages, more happine&s;s is met with than in many large &s;tates in Au&s;tria, and there is much more good done by private per&s;ons in the former, than in any of the latter.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;ciences and literature of all kinds, Berlin is, doubtle&s;s, one of the fir&s;t cities in the world; it is obliged to the late king, for its pre-eminence, who e&s;tabli&s;hed a freedom of thinking, not to be met with in any other country, out of England. This king had an academy of men of learning, and there is no &s;tate where the public mini&s;ters, and effective coun&s;ellors, are &s;uch cho&s;en men, that there is hardly one but would be a won|derful writer in his own line: there is &s;carce a &s;ingle cha|racter of eminence but who is well acquainted with the be&s;t French, Engli&s;h, and Italian writers. An advantage which neither the Engli&s;h, French, or Italians can di&s;pute with them.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="246">There is a univer&s;ity at Koning&s;berg under good regu|lations, and in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate; and &s;ome provincial &s;chools.</P>
<P>The religion of this country, is the Lutheran; but as great numbers of the coloni&s;ts, are Calvini&s;ts, they have al&s;o their churches, not only in the cities and towns, but in many of the villages. There are but two or three Popi&s;h churches throughout Pru&s;&s;ia. Indeed the free exerci&s;e of every religion, is allowed all over the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions. Here are no bi&s;hopricks, but all eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters are referred to the con&s;i&s;tories at Koning&s;berg and Saalfield, which are &s;omething like the pre&s;byteries in the kirk of Scotland. The churches in every haupt-amt, or di&s;trict, is &s;ubject to an arch-pre&s;byter or in&s;pector.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of their Trade, Manufactures, and Government.</HEAD>
<P>THE manufactures in Pru&s;&s;ia are daily improving and increa&s;ing, particularly the gla&s;s and iron-works; pa|per,
<PB N="206" REF="247">
powder, copper and bra&s;s mills; manufactures of cloth, camlet, linen, &s;ilk, &s;tockings &amp;c. Pru&s;&s;ia, is very conveniently &s;ituated for trade; a college for commerce and navigation has been erected, which has the cogni|zance of all ca&s;es in, and &s;ettles all di&s;putes relative to, trade and commerce.</P>
<P>The commodities of Pru&s;&s;ia, and Great Lithuania, &s;old to foreign merchants, and annually exported, are all kinds of grain, pine-trees for ma&s;ts, deal boards and other timber, tar, wood-a&s;hes, pot-a&s;h, elk-&s;kins, leather, firs, amber, 12,500 &s;tone of wax, honey, gra&s;s, manna, lin&s;eed|oil, flax, hemp, lin&s;eed, and hemp-&s;eed, 4000 &s;acks of the former, 700 of the latter; yarn, hogs bri&s;tles, &s;tags horns, elks, hor&s;es, oatmeal, mead, dried fi&s;h, &s;turgeon, caviar, lampreys, butter, and about 3400 &s;tone of tal|low.</P>
<P>The number of foreign &s;hips, that re&s;ort here for lad|ing, annually, are about 550, which import wine, &s;alt, &s;pice, linen, cloth and other woollen, &s;tuffs, herrings, tin, copper, lead, tobacco, &s;ugar, rice, coffee and other gro|cery, and Koning&s;berg is the great market.</P>
<P>The Sile&s;ia linens are famous all over the world, and the Sile&s;ia fore&s;ts afford a great deal of wood for &s;hip|building. The Ville de Paris, taken from the French on the celebrated 12th of Augu&s;t, was wholly built of Sile&s;ia wood.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="248">So many thou&s;and of French manufacturers having found protection in this country, gold and &s;ilver lace, and wrought &s;ilks are hardly to be bought in any place &s;o cheap. They talk of prohibiting tho&s;e of France. The environs of Berlin produce annually 400lb weight of raw &s;ilk. The King has indeed taken the manufactory into his own hands, with a view of increa&s;ing it.</P>
<P>The late king having kept his eye on the importation of luxuries into his dominions, making it a rule al|ways to lay an exci&s;e on rich luxuries, in proportion to their increa&s;e, has always kept down the foreign trade, but on the other hand it increa&s;ed the indu&s;try of his &s;ub|jects, a demon&s;trative proof of this is the a&s;toni&s;hing in|crea&s;e of towns and people. No country in Europe of the &s;ame &s;ize, has doubled its population, as Pru&s;&s;ia has done, within the &s;pace of 50 years.</P>
<P>Before I &s;peak of their government, I will pre&s;ent my readers with a &s;hort ab&s;tract of their hi&s;tory. They are called <HI>Poru&s;&s;i</HI> or Pru&s;&s;ians, being clo&s;e neighbours of the Ru&s;&s;ians. <HI>Po</HI> &s;ignifies neighbouring. We hear of the Pru&s;&s;ians in the tenth century, but the Teutonic knights, who made religion a cloak for their ambitious views, and committed the mo&s;t inhuman barbarities, under pretence of propagating the go&s;pel of peace, extirpated the native Pru&s;&s;ians in 1309, and planted the Germans, their coun|trymen, in their &s;tead. In 1454, one half of Pru&s;&s;ia re|volted from the the Teutonic order, and declared for Ca&s;|&s;imir
<PB N="208" REF="249">
III. king of Poland. This occa&s;ioned fre&s;h effu|&s;ions of blood, till in 1466, it was &s;ettled that one part of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;hould continue under the King's protection, and that the Teutonic knights &s;hould retain the other; and after fre&s;h commotions, it was agreed in 1525, that the margrave, grand-ma&s;ter of the Teutonic order, &s;hould be duke, or &s;overeign of the ea&s;tern part of Ru&s;&s;ia, as a fief of Poland. This new duke introduced the re|formed religion in 1544.</P>
<P>Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia, now the kingdom, was added to the hou&s;e of Brandenburg, by the elector Joachim, it having been clo&s;ely connected long before and the elector taking part with the Poles, again&s;t the Swedes, was acknowledged by Poland in 1657, as an independent duke. <HI>Frederick,</HI> his &s;on in 1701, rai&s;ed the duchy to a kingdom, and crowned him&s;elf with his own hands. <HI>Frederick</HI> II. his grand&s;on, the late king, annexed to his dominions the greate&s;t part of Sile&s;ia, and Ea&s;t Friezland, and all Po|li&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia, by the late partition.</P>
<P>The royal arms are a di&s;played eagle, and the King's titles are King of Pru&s;&s;ia, Margrave of Brandenburg, Duke of Sile&s;ia, Arch-chamberlain, and Prince, Elector of the holy Roman Empire, &s;overeign Prince of Orange, Neufchatel, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are here two orders, that of the Black Eagle, in|&s;tituted by the fir&s;t king, a broad orange-coloured rib|bon
<PB N="209" REF="250">
and a &s;ilver &s;tar; and the order of Merit, in&s;tituted by the late king, viz: a golden &s;tar, enamelled with blue, worn appendant to a black ribbon, edged with &s;ilver.</P>
<P>The five members of the royal court of regency, which &s;uperintends the whole kingdom, whether political, civil, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical, are all privy-coun&s;ellors, or mi|ni&s;ters of &s;tate and war, and the&s;e five have two &s;ecreta|ries. There are, be&s;ides, two chambers of war and de|me&s;nes, one of Koning&s;berg, the other of Gumbinnen, which have the direction of the revenue, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The late king e&s;tabli&s;hed a reputation on the &s;ure&s;t foundation, by that bold and generous &s;troke in politics, in delivering his country from the jaws of lawyers, who before his time, at lea&s;t in Brandenburg, &s;ported with the wretched. In Pru&s;&s;ia the deci&s;ion of cau&s;es, cannot be protracted. Suits in Brandenburg are now brought to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue at an ea&s;y expence.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of the crown-lands, mines, manufactures, and other royal revenues, the finance &s;y&s;tem re&s;ts on the taxes and cu&s;toms, which are forty per cent. The land-tax, is about nine &s;hillings in the pound. The&s;e taxes are cer|tainly high, but &s;uch is the regularity of government, and &s;o little oppre&s;&s;ion is met with from revenue-officers, that the people are, neverthele&s;s, happy, for they are very indu&s;trious, and indu&s;try will always accumulate wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="251">Though the King's revenues do not exceed a million and a half &s;terling, apparently a &s;mall &s;um in England, yet, con&s;idering the difference in the value of money, and the uncommon exertions of oeconomy unequalled in any other court, it is as good as five millions with us. The late king, by a ballance of trade in his favour, annually laid by 100,000l. as much as the new buildings, the payment of his troops and the improvements in his country, co&s;t.</P>
<P>The incomes of the Pru&s;&s;ian princes are by no means &s;canty. Every prince has 50,000 rubles (each ruble four &s;hillings and &s;ixpence) a year, &s;ettled on him as &s;oon as of age, and the King's brother, and hereditary prince have e&s;tates and incomes, to the amount of 350,000 livres a year, each livre ten pence-halfpenny Engli&s;h. At Berlin, though money is more &s;carce than at London, or Paris, a &s;tranger will find very little difference in the com|mon expence of living.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the government is not favourable to great and independant lords, for indeed all landlords are prevented from oppre&s;&s;ing their pea&s;ants. As the &s;oldiery are drawn from them, care is taken that they &s;hall not be deprived of the chief &s;ource of health and vigour, and there is no pea|&s;antry in Europe better fed than the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>The Pru&s;&s;ian &s;tate, con&s;idered as a &s;tate, is the riche&s;t in Europe; and it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, that it ever
<PB N="211" REF="252">
&s;hould be expo&s;ed to any inconvenience, from the want of money; its &s;y&s;tem of finance being e&s;tabli&s;hed on &s;uch &s;olid foundations, that it any future king, was to think of introducing a change, it would over-turn the whole. The bank-bills of Berlin are bought up with avidity. No one thinks they will ever lo&s;e their credit. The Dutch are very happy when this bank will take their money. The late king and his father, &s;olved the three mo&s;t difficult problems of &s;tate that exi&s;t, and hi&s;tory affords no examples of their having been &s;olved &s;o quickly, &s;o hap|pily, and &s;o univer&s;ally, as they have been by the&s;e princes. They made a lazy, &s;tupid, and prodigal people, indu&s;trious, active, and alert; they gave to a country, which had been entirely neglected by nature, a value which many, of the mo&s;t highly favoured countries have not, and they placed a &s;mall nation in a &s;ituation, not only to vanqui&s;h in <HI>a favourable moment,</HI> all the combined forces of Europe, but to be able <HI>at any time</HI> to mea&s;ure &s;words with the able&s;t of them, &s;ingly.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Army.</HEAD>
<P>PRUSSIA has no navy, but her military forces, e&s;pe|cially in the reign of the late king, have been no le&s;s formidable for their di&s;cipline than by their number. And it may be a&s;&s;erted with great truth, that for a fine appear|ance, military di&s;cipline and activity, the Pru&s;&s;ian army has not its equal in the world. The corps of cadets at Berlin, is a nur&s;ery for good officers. The number of troops in the pay of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, is generally computed at 120,000, half of which are foreigners. He has a body of eighty &s;quadrons of Hu&s;&s;ars, each &s;quadron 130 men, fine, comely, youthful, &s;trong, and well-&s;haped figures. The arms of the&s;e men are a light mu&s;ket and &s;abre: their cloathing, a coar&s;e, red cloth, made clo&s;e to their bodies, and &s;trengthened at the elbows, by leather, in the &s;hape of a heart; their breeches are, a well-dre&s;&s;ed &s;heep &s;kin; their boots, &s;hort and light, but the &s;oles of them durable; their caps &s;o &s;tout, as to &s;tand a cut.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Hu&s;&s;ars, the King has a &s;mall body of men called Hunters, reputed the mo&s;t faithful couriers in his pay, and are often promoted for their fidelity, in ardu|ous enterpri&s;es. The&s;e with a &s;ingle ball, are very dex|trous
<PB N="213" REF="254">
mark&s;men, and are employed to pick out the officers from the men. When the&s;e hunters are taken, no quarter is granted on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Pru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers are remarkable for their &s;hort cloathing, and their elbows being covered with leather, a &s;oldier is never &s;een the lea&s;t in rags; on the contrary in cleanline&s;s of per&s;on, they all appear like gentlemen.</P>
<P>The Kings guards, and &s;ome few other regiments, are cloathed yearly; but, in general, the army has new regi|mentals only twice in three years. They wear white linen &s;patterda&s;hes in &s;ummer, and black, in winter. In &s;um|mer their breeches are dimity, and in winter, white wool|len: their hair is pig-tailed behind and always powdered, when on duty.</P>
<P>The hats of the foot-&s;oldiers and grenadiers caps are &s;mall; they carry their cartouch-box higher than other troops, but their arms are heavier then common. They are kept &s;o remarkable clean, that a &s;oldier can hardly find time to be idle or wicked. They go through their exerci&s;e twice a day, and when the weather is bad, they are under cover.</P>
<P>None but the natives of Brandenburg, are employed in any other than military duty, but the&s;e in time of peace may, by rotation, follow their re&s;pective employs. In &s;um|mer-time, bodies of cavalry are &s;ent into the field, which
<PB N="214" REF="255">
are on the look-out to prevent di&s;ertion and robberies on the roads. The&s;e detachments are computed at 100 men each, and a watch-guard of two men is placed at certain di&s;tances on the roads, near their body.</P>
<P>The pay of a common &s;oldier is eight gro&s;ch a week. This is fourteen pence Engli&s;h, and his bread. Of this pay three pence is &s;topped for wa&s;hing, and materials to clean his arms. Upon this calculation 120,000 men co&s;t but 364,000&pound;. but if we include their bread, cloathing and the pay of officers, it does not much exceed a million &s;terling.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Duchy of Sile&s;ia.</HEAD>
<P>THE duchy of Sile&s;ia is divided between the two crowns, that of Bohemia, and that of Pru&s;&s;ia; but the greate&s;t part of it is in the dominions of Pru&s;&s;ia, taken from the Queen of Hungary, and ceded to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in 1744. This territory con&s;i&s;ts of 19 prin|cipalities, and contains about 650 geographical &s;quare miles.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="257">Sile&s;ia terminates to the ea&s;t on Poland, where the country is level and open. On the &s;outh it is &s;eparated from Hungary by a chain of mountains, and a wild thicket, in &s;ome parts a German mile wide, which both Crowns have claimed, but which is &s;till di&s;puted, and of cour&s;e remains as a barrier. In the &s;outh and we&s;t, Sile&s;ia is bounded by a chain of hills, for height and extent &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable in Europe. In the&s;e mountains and all over that part of upper Sile&s;ia, lying towards Moravia and Hungary, the winter &s;ets in earlier and is of longer con|tinuance, and much more &s;evere than in the levels. In tho&s;e very months, when at the foot of &s;ome of the&s;e mountains every thing is covered with ice and &s;now; the trees at Bre&s;lau in winter are in full verdure. The inhabi|tants of the mountains are not only confined to their hou&s;es by the &s;nows, though in latitude 50 and 51; but like the Laplanders, and people of Carniola, u&s;e a kind of &s;cates, by which they travel over the &s;nows with amazing &s;wift|ne&s;s. In the principality of Glogau, and beyond the Oder, towards Poland, there are very exten&s;ive lands, but the deficiency of good crops there is amply &s;upplied, by the fertility of the other, and larger parts of Sile&s;ia, which exclu&s;ive of wheat, rye, barley and oats, yields, maize or barley, wheat, &s;pelt, buck-wheat, millet, lin|&s;eed, peas, and beans. The culinary herbs about Bre&s;lau Brieg, Neyze, Franken&s;tein, and Lignitz, are excellent and the neighbourhood of Granberg, and Lower Beuthen affords plenty of fine fruits.

Here are a cathedral, twenty-four churches of different per&s;wa&s;ions, with &s;ome convents, a bi&s;hop's palace, and a Popi&s;h univer&s;ity. The city has a governor, a high court of ju&s;tice, a court of exchequer, a war, a domain, and &s;everal tax-offices, a college of phy&s;icians, and a mint.

The bi&s;hop is a Roman Catholic, but the magi&s;tracy is Lu|theran. It is the centre of all the trade in Sile&s;ia, and carries on divers manufactures.

<P>All the country within thirty miles of the city, is rich, either in corn, meadow, or wool; the arable land is well cultivated, and potatoes are planted, for the con&s;umption of Bre&s;lau, in great quantities.

The winter colds are neither too &s;harp, nor the &s;ummer heats too &s;trong. The air is dry, clear, and temperate. The country is high, and forms a large extent, &s;urrounded, on all &s;ides, by very high hills, covered with rich woods. The vale in the middle, is watered by the Elbe, the Mol|daw, and the Eyer, of which an idea may be ea&s;ily form|ed by looking on the map, that it is protected from the force of the winds; though being an inland country, re|mote, from any other, it is colder than many places in the &s;ame latitude.</P>
<P>The &s;everal hollows in the middle of the vale, contri|bute to let out the waters, &s;o that there are neither lakes, nor mora&s;&s;es, to fill the air with unwhole&s;ome vapours. Some few parts of the country are &s;andy, and &s;ome &s;tony, but the &s;oil in general, is fat and rich.</P>

<P>In this neighbourhood is the famous hill of Bohemia, called Rie&s;enberge, con&s;idered by the inhabitants of this flat country, as a mountain; but in fact, though it is 8000 feet in a&s;cent, and requiring three hours time to climb to the top, yet it is a mole hill, compared with mount St. Gothard in Switzerland, who&s;e elevation, above the Mediterranean Sea, is more than 13,000 feet, and yet, by no means, the highe&s;t mountain of the Alps.

That part of Bohemia, between Prague and Saxony, is infinitely richer, and more beautiful than that which lies between Prague and Au&s;tria. Agriculture like the country it&s;elf, is more varied, the people, live clo&s;er together, and &s;eem to be happier. Hills, woods, plains and vales, form an agreeable contra&s;t with each other, and the vine, not to be &s;een el&s;ewhere, but in the road from Prague to Dre&s;den, here covers the &s;ides of the hills.</P>
<P>Bohemia produces every thing that can contribute to the comfort of life, in a&s;toni&s;hing abundance, wine and &s;alt only excepted. But the&s;e they have brought to them, at a moderate price. There have been many &s;ucce&s;sful experiments made to produce wine, but the country is &s;carce able to produce a &s;ufficiency of this article for its con&s;umption. Bohemian hops, are carried as far as the Rhine, in great quantities, and they export a great deal of &s;trong beer.

On this account, an attentive traveller finds the towns, boroughs, villages, and highways very de&s;olate.</P>
<P>Of 32 royal towns, Prague is the chief, and the capital of the kingdom. It lies almo&s;t in the mid|dle; and on both &s;ides of the river Moldau, which is here &s;hallow, and not navigable, but about 800 paces broad. The &s;tone bridge over it, is 742 common paces long, and &s;o wide that three carriages may pa&s;s a-brea&s;t. It &s;tand on &s;ixteen piers, ornamented on the &s;ides with twenty-eight &s;tatues of &s;aints. It was built by <HI>Charles</HI> IV. in 1357. The fortifications are not

It has broader &s;treets, but fewer &s;tately palaces, than Vienna, and contains 92 churches, and chapels, and about 40 convents. The inhabitants are e&s;timated at 70,000 Chri&s;tians, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 12 and 13&punc;000 Jews. It is a very large city divided into three by the river, is above th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee miles long, two broad, but is by no means populous. In &s;everal parts you &s;eem as in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> village. Near the bridge, which &s;tands at the upper part of the city, the number of people is very great, but the further you go from this, the more de&s;titute is the place. The royal ca&s;tle, which is a very large, irregular building, is built on a hill, that commands an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect. Not far from hence, &s;tands the archbi&s;hop's hou&s;e, (a pretty modern build|ing) and the old cathedral, in which are &s;ome pieces of architecture, which de&s;erve notice. The Bohemian no|bility, who can bear the expence, re&s;ide at Vienna.</P>
<P>Though the city is, in general, ill-built, the &s;ituation is extremely fine; there is a finer pro&s;pect from the bridge, than in many larger cities. The ma&s;s of hou&s;es ri&s;es like an amphitheatre to a con&s;iderable height. To the right, the hill ri&s;es above them, as far as the Imperial palace, maje&s;tically &s;ituated on the top. On the left it is covered, as far as the middle, with beautiful gardens, and plea&s;ure hou&s;es, which have
<PB N="231" REF="273">
a fine effect; and, a mo&s;t exten&s;ive, and magnificent amphitheatre.</P>
<P>From the&s;e gardens, is a very fine pro&s;pect over the oppo&s;ite part of the city. In the mid&s;t of the broad but dry Moldau, there are two &s;mall i&s;lands, called Great and Little Venice, where the inhabitants make parties of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Jews form a con&s;iderable part of the inha|bitants of this place, and live in a quarter by them|&s;elves, called the Jews city. It is plea&s;ant to walk through the place, and &s;ee their taylors and &s;hoe|makers at work in the middle of the &s;treets. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed here from the Chri&s;tians, by a yel|low handkerchief, which they are obliged to wear round their arms. Their indu&s;try is wonderful. In almo&s;t every inn, there is a Jew, who does the bu|&s;ine&s;s of a hou&s;e-&s;ervant, and does every thing, but will take no money: the only reward they will ac|cept, is &s;ome ca&s;t cloaths; which they make money of.</P>
<P>In whatever degree, this city may have dwindled in wealth and magnificence, the piety of the inhabitants certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ouri&s;hes as much as ever. I do not recollect, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> &s;o many glaring acts of devotion in any place. The corners of the &s;treets, bridges, and pub|lic buildings, are all ornamented with crucifixes, ima|ges
<PB N="232" REF="274">
of the Virgin, of all &s;izes, and complexions, and &s;tatues of &s;aints of every country, condition, age, and &s;ex. People are to be &s;een on their knees, before the&s;e &s;tatues, in every part of this city; but particu|larly on the bridge, where there is the greate&s;t con|cour&s;e of pa&s;&s;engers. Not contented with kneeling, I &s;aw &s;ome pro&s;trate on their faces, ki&s;&s;ing the earth. Here is a chapel of Loretto, belonging to the Ca|puchins, in imitation of the holy hou&s;e of Lorretto, in Italy; it is &s;o rich with jewels and trea&s;ure, as to be e&s;timated in value, at &s;everal tons of gold. Here is one pyx, &s;et with 6666 diamonds, repre&s;enting the &s;un, which co&s;t 200,000 guilders, and 10,000 making.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of the nobility, are many of them built after the Italian model. That of the duke of Fried|land, is a &s;tately &s;tructure, built on the ruins of above 100 hou&s;es, which were pulled down to make room for it, and furni&s;h materials. The gardens are ex|ceedingly beautiful. In the &s;tables, which are very large, &s;tands a marble pillar, between each hor&s;e, and to every &s;tanding, is a rack of &s;teel, and a marble manger; and over it, the picture of the hor&s;e that u&s;ed it, as large as life, with his name.</P>
<P>In the hou&s;es of the pea&s;ants, there is a place walled in, to hold the &s;tove, or fire-place, to which they a&s;cend by a few narrow &s;tone &s;teps, as into a
<PB N="233" REF="275">
cock loft, in this warm apartment, they &s;leep away the cold winter-nights, very comfortably.</P>
<P>The church of the Cro&s;s of, is an elegant piece of architecture, adorned with fine marble pillars, and beautiful paintings. Without the town-hou&s;e, is a clock, made at the end of the 15th century, exhibiting the revolutions of the &s;un and moon, the day of the month, the length of the days, nights &amp;c. but great part of the movements are out of order. The hor&s;e-market is a very large, airy place, and is adorned with an eque&s;trian &s;tatue of King <HI>Wence&s;laus</HI> in the centre. The cathedral church of St. Vitus, is very rich in plate, altar-furniture, relics, &amp;c. Among other valuable ornaments, is a crucifix of Hungarian virgin-gold, weighing 10,000 ducats. A con&s;iderable part of St. <HI>Wence&s;laus</HI> chapel, is covered with ja&s;per, ame|thy&s;ts, and cornelian, &s;ome as large as a man's fi&s;t, but irregularly &s;et without order.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect from the royal apartments of the palace, is quite charming, and the hall, where the Emperor entertains the nobility, is well contrived and very &s;plendid. Within the palace is a mu&s;eum.</P>
<P>The whole town, in this city, is a &s;tate-pri&s;on, and it is &s;aid, there was formerly in one of the rooms of this town, a curious machine, made in the &s;hape of a woman, which, when any delinquent was brought

<P>On the Rat&s;chin is the palace of Count <HI>Czernini</HI> which in &s;ize is inferior to Walen&s;tein-Hou&s;e, which &s;tands near it, but in the magnificence of the build|ing, and richne&s;s of the furniture, it has few equals, in any city in Europe. About forty years ago, when <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> was there, the grand hall was not fini&s;hed, though it was 100 years &s;ince it was fir&s;t began, and workmen were generally employed upon it. The noble gallery of pictures in this palace, is 175 paces long. The count's annual income is 300,000 guilders, (each guilder 2s. 4d. Engli&s;h,) and he &s;pared no ex|pence in its embelli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The credulity and &s;uper&s;tition of the Bohemians is a&s;toni&s;hing; here is a pillar in the church of St. Peter, which they &s;ay the devil brought from Rome, and broke, by putting it down too hard; and, it is &s;o univer&s;ally credited, that it would be dangerous to que&s;tion its truth. On the altar of St. <HI>Longinus,</HI> the officer that pierced the &s;ide of Chri&s;t, on the cro&s;s, is a large &s;tone coffin, in which the &s;aint is &s;aid to have &s;ailed on the Moldau. On the bank of this river, which is
<PB N="235" REF="277">
1000 paces broad, they have built a chapel, to comme|morate the leap, which a &s;orcerer took on hor&s;eback, over the river: and they tell you, this hor&s;e had the talent of conver&s;ing with its ma&s;ter. On the para|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the wall, where the hor&s;e allighted, which is of brick, they &s;hew the print of the hor&s;e's feet. The&s;e and &s;uch like fables abound throughout Bohemia, and are not only very frequently related, very gravely in common di&s;cour&s;e, but to obtain greater credit, are publi&s;hed in books. Indeed, many of the Au&s;trian and Bohemian nobility, will &s;wallow improbabilities, with|out examination, or making u&s;e of their rea&s;on, even beyond any other Roman-catholics.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce a bridge in all the Au&s;trian hered<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ditary &s;tates, that has not a &s;tatue of St. <HI>Nepomac,</HI> who is the patron of bridges. This &s;aint &s;uffered martyrdom, by being precipitated from the bridge of Prague by order of King <HI>Wence&s;laus</HI> in 1724, be|cau&s;e he would not reveal what the queen had en|tru&s;ted him with at confe&s;&s;ion. The canonization of this new patron was a great expence to the Bohemians. It was in the pontificate of <HI>Clement</HI> XI.</P>
<P>Prague has been frequently be&s;ieged, and frequently taken; not to mention former times. It was taken by the Saxons in 1631; by the Swedes, in 1648; by the elector of Bavaria, in 1741; by the Au&s;trians, in 1742; and by the Ru&s;&s;ians, in 1744.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="278">An hours-ride from the city, &s;tands the white-hill, where the memorable battle on the 8th of November, 1620, was fought, between the Emperor's forces, commanded by the duke of Bavaria, and the troops of the elector pala|tine, the head of the prote&s;tant league; wherein the elec|tor's army being di&s;per&s;ed, the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Ger|many &s;uffered much, and the elector lo&s;t both the kingdom of Bohemia, and the palatinate. This was the &s;on-in-law of <HI>James</HI> I. of England, from whom the pre&s;ent family on the Engli&s;h throne, is de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Prague has neither an exten&s;ive commerce, nor any ma|nufactory of con&s;equence. There has long been a pro|ject of rendering the Moldau navigable, but the expence has hitherto prevented it. Was it once done, Prague would certainly gain a great deal by it. There is a con|vent of Iri&s;h nuns here; indeed, throughout all Germa|ny, we meet with Engli&s;h and Scotch nuns. The women of this place are hand&s;ome, and &s;trangers may make love much ea&s;ier here than at Vienna, becau&s;e the people here know better how to connect mental enjoyments with &s;en|&s;ual plea&s;ures. Free-Ma&s;onry flouri&s;hes in Prague ex|tremely, and &s;ome per&s;ons doat on it to enthu&s;ia&s;m. The numerous garri&s;on here lodged, contributes not a little to the liveline&s;s of the place. There are about 9000 men con&s;tantly quartered here, the &s;ix regiments of grenadiers, are the fine&s;t of infantry, and the officers are excellent company, and entirely free from tho&s;e prejudices, from which other bodies of men are not totally exempt.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="279">The per&s;ons of the Bohemians, like their neighbours the Germans, are rather of the large&s;t; they are all very corpulent, of a hale complexion, and wonderfully &s;trong built. <HI>Dubravious,</HI> one of their hi&s;torians, who was Bi&s;hop of Olmutz, in the 16th century, compares them to Lions, "as the land," &s;ays he, "according to the writers of tho&s;e times, lies under the influence of <HI>Leo,</HI> &s;o does its inhabitants po&s;&s;e&s;s all the qua|lities of that noble animal.

<P>They are hand&s;ome, &s;trong-built, and an active race of people, evidently de&s;cended from the Croats, who are &s;ome of the hand&s;ome&s;t people upon the earth.

A monument in one of the churches is erected to his me|mory, and under it he is repre&s;ented on a ba&s;&s;o-relievo of marble, in armour, with a long &s;word by his &s;ide, a band and whi&s;kers, leaning with his right hand on a cele&s;tial &s;phere.</P>
<P>Prague, like Vienna, abounds in literati, who are content to line their rooms, with the bu&s;ts, medals, prints and pro|files of learned men, but neither think, or write for them|&s;elves; and are only called Literati from belonging to no other a&s;&s;ociation of men whatever.

In the general acceptation, a man of letters, is only a <HI>nega|tive</HI> quality. I was, continues the Baron, acquainted with a few <HI>po&s;itive</HI> literati at Prague, but their number, in com|panion of the <HI>negative,</HI> is very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The Bohemians, however, who apply them&s;elves to the arts and &s;ciences, are generally &s;peaking, &s;ucce&s;sful in them. They do not want genius, and have uncommon indu&s;try. Their fondne&s;s for mu&s;ic is a&s;toni&s;hing. I have, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> heard &s;everal orche&s;tras here which equalled tho&s;e of Paris in brilliancy of execution, and &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them in accuracy and exactne&s;s of harmony. Bohemian players on the horn and harp, are to be met with throughout all Germany. As they always bring home large &s;ums of money, you &s;eldom &s;ee a mu&s;ician of this kind, who has not travelled. Mo&s;t of the &s;tudents of Rome are mu&s;ici|ans, and begin, very early in life, to give &s;erenades and concerts in the &s;quares, and public places of the city.</P>
<P>Of the religion of this country, I will be more particu|lar. Chri&s;tianity was introduced here, about the year 890, but about 1403, &s;ome &s;cholars who had attended <HI>Richard</HI> of England's Queen (who was a Bohemian) to London, and had conver&s;ed with the di&s;ciples of Wickliffe; on their

return, communicated their doctrine to <HI>John Hu&s;s</HI> a doctor of the univer&s;ity of Prague, who from the hints he thus received, began to reflect on the errors of the church of Rome, and with <HI>Jerome,</HI> a ma&s;ter of arts of that univer&s;ity, began a reformation, by preaching again&s;t the Pope's &s;u|premacy, and other tenets of the Roman-catholic church, and brought over great part of the Bohemians to their way of thinking. This brought <HI>Hu&s;s</HI> and <HI>Jerome</HI> to the &s;take, and put their adherents under the bar, which occa|&s;ioned a bloody war, that continued many years. In 1547 the greater part of the Moravian or Bohemian brethren, were bani&s;hed their country and fled to Poland and Pru&s;|&s;ia. In the &s;ixteenth century the Lutherans increa&s;ed con|&s;iderably in Bohemia, and a toleration was granted in 1575. In 1616, <HI>Matthias,</HI> Emperor of Germany, declar|ed his cou&s;in <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> King of Bohemia, and cau&s;ed him to be crowned, and this <HI>Ferdinand</HI> &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed the pro|te&s;tants, that an in&s;urrection took place, the Prote&s;tants. threw the emperor's chief ju&s;tice out of the ca&s;tle-window two &s;tories high, or 28 ells (<HI>Key&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er</HI> &s;ays, &s;ix &s;tories) and after him, one of the council of &s;tate, and a &s;ecretary of the emperor, (which window they &s;hew to &s;trangers to this day) rai&s;ed an army, and offered the crown to <HI>Frederick</HI> V. Elector Palatine, who married <HI>Elizabeth</HI> daughter of <HI>James</HI> I. King of England. This prince accepted the throne, and was crowned in November, 1619. <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> King of Bohemia, who had &s;ucceeded to the empire, pro|claimed him as a rebel, marched an army again&s;t him, and on the white hill near Prague, as I have mentioned, defeat|ed

In 1627, the Prote&s;tants were deprived of their privileges, and &s;uch as would not &s;ubmit to the Roman-catholic church, were expelled the kingdom. From that time po|pery has been the ruling religion in Bohemia. The few remaining Lutherans were afterwards obliged to conceal them&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop of Prague is legate of the holy apo&s;|tolic &s;ee of Rome, is a prince of the holy Roman empire, primate of the kingdom, and &s;tanding chancellor of the univer&s;ity of Prague. He crowns the King, and has two &s;uffragan bi&s;hops under him, tho&s;e of Leutmeritz and Ko|nigingratz.

<P><PB N="247" REF="290">How &s;trange is the policy of this country! The govern|ment of Bohemia allows the Jews, the profe&s;&s;ed enemies of chri&s;tianity, freedom of thought, and liberty to &s;erve God in their own way, and refu&s;es it to Chri&s;tians like them&s;elves. Whil&s;t a ho&s;tile, dreadful, treacherous peo|ple, are maintained in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their rights and privileges, contracts have been repeatedly violated with the Hu&s;&s;ites.</P>
<P>A word or two of their government, &s;hall clo&s;e our account of this country.</P>
<P>Bohemia is frequently con&s;idered as part of Germany, but, it is one of the Emperor's hereditary countries, and ex|cluded from tho&s;e privileges, which the other circles and electorates enjoy; except that the Imperial family, as Kings of Bohemia, have a voice in the election of a king of the Romans. For near 200 years the Au&s;trian family have claimed the kingdom of Bohemia, with the incorporate provinces of Sile&s;ia and Moravia, as their hereditary dominions, governing them by no other laws than their own will and plea&s;ure. Sile&s;ia indeed has been di&s;puted, and is divided, as I have mentioned, between Pru&s;&s;ia and Bohemia. The King, as elector of Bohemia, precedes all temporal electors, and owns no vicar of the Roman empire. He is arch-cup-bearer of the holy Roman empire, and on this office re&s;ts the King of Bohemia's right to elect a king of the Romans.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="291">The arms of Bohemia are a &s;ilver lion with a double tail on a field, gules.</P>
<P>The crown of Bohemia was pre&s;erved one hundred years elective by the nobility as in Poland, till it &s;ettled in the pre&s;ent Au&s;trian family. Their hu&s;bandmen, trade&s;men and mechanicks were, and &s;till are, in a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage to their re&s;pective lords, who have the entire di&s;po&s;al of them, and admini&s;ter ju&s;tice as they &s;ee fit, in their &s;eve|ral courts. Nor does the government interfere in their deci&s;ions, but in &s;ome extraordinary ca&s;es, where it may affect the &s;tate, or where the life of the &s;ubject may be wantonly taken away; &s;o that every lord is, in effect, a monarch in his own territories.</P>

<P>AUSTRIAN, as well as Pru&s;&s;ian, Sile&s;ia was former|ly a part of the kingdom of Poland, but many German colonies having &s;ettled there in the 13th cen|tury, gave ri&s;e to the &s;eparation which was afterwards thoroughly effected.</P>
<P>The Poles having entertained a di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t the Si|le&s;ian Dukes, on account of their adopting the German manners, &s;oon paved the way for <HI>Wenzel</HI> II. king of Bohemia to a&s;cend the throne of Poland in 1292. This monarch marched an army through Sile&s;ia, where &s;eve|ral Princes &s;ubmitted to him, who&s;e example was gra|dually followed by the re&s;t: thus they all came under the Bohemian government, taking their lands in fief from the crown.</P>
<P>This change was ratified by the Poli&s;h kings, for <HI>Ca&s;imir,</HI> the then reigning king, entered into a cove|nant
<PB N="250" REF="293">
with <HI>John,</HI> king of Bohemia, by virtue of which he re&s;igned Sile&s;ia to him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, as the lat|ter al&s;o on his part di&s;claimed all right to Poland.</P>
<P>By virtue of a Golden Bull, procured by the empe|ror, <HI>Charles</HI> IV. in 1355, Sile&s;ia was &s;olemnly united to the crown of Bohemia: which con&s;titution la&s;ted till the death of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. in 1740. But <HI>Frederick</HI> II. king of Pru&s;&s;ia, revived after this, the claim of the electoral hou&s;e of Brandenburg to the duchies of Jagerndorf, Lignitz, Brieg, and Wohlaw; to accompli&s;h which he marched an army into Sile&s;ia, and a war was the con|&s;equence with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; in which the form|er having &s;ucce&s;sfully reduced all the Lower Sile&s;ia, to|gether with the greate&s;t part of the Upper, and the County of Glatz to his &s;ubjection, he was confirmed in it by the treaties of Bre&s;lau and Dre&s;den, in 1742, and 1745.</P>
<P>Since the latter period, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia has ruled this part of Sile&s;ia, independant of the crown of Bohemia and the German empire. And hence it comes to pa&s;s, that it is only the re&s;idue of Sile&s;ia the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria is now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, as a Bohemian fief: and thus becomes connected with the German Empire.</P>
<P>The territories of Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia con&s;i&s;t of four prin|cipalities, namely, Te&s;chen, Troppau, Jagerndorf, and Grotkau.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="294">There are no con&s;iderable cities in Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia, but many &s;mall towns and villages; however none &s;uffi|ciently intere&s;ting to give the reader a de&s;cription of. The inhabitants are, like their neighbours, the Bohemians and Germans, tall, athletic, and robu&s;t in &s;tature. The people of quality are &s;aid to be naturally brave, and more inclined to arms than to the milder arts and &s;cien|ces; and of an ea&s;y, affable conver&s;ation. On the con|trary, the lower cla&s;s of people are bruti&s;h and very cruel, given to every &s;pecies of vice, particularly tho&s;e that ari&s;e from intemperance in the immoderate u&s;e of &s;piri|tuous liquors. For the mo&s;t part, tho&s;e people are, like the Highlanders of Scotland, very much addicted to the idle fancies of a &s;econd &s;ight, indulging the notions of apparitions and &s;pectres, &s;o that every cave or &s;olitary abode, with which this country greatly abounds, is &s;aid to be haunted: this rai&s;es a continual dread and terror in the inhabitants; &s;olely from the chimerical operations of a di&s;tempered imagination; which to a long indulged habit, create &s;uch lively repre&s;entations of &s;upernatural objects, that the di&s;temper can &s;carcely ever be eradi|cated.</P>
<P>Au&s;trian Sile&s;ia is &s;ubject to Bohemian laws; for neither the arts or laws of the German Diet or empire are of any force here, as with the &s;ubjects of Bohemia; they acknowledge only their own princes of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="295">The manufactures of the country are linen and woollen! in which they are arrived at no great perfection. Cop|per, tin, and iron are al&s;o tolerably well performed in their manufactories. The imports are very incon&s;i|derable.</P>
<P>This country is inter&s;per&s;ed with rocks and moun|tains, which are very barren; but the valleys are fertile, and produce every nece&s;&s;ary of life; with &s;everal mines of copper, lead, and iron.</P>
<P>The cattle are partly of the &s;ame denominations of tho&s;e in England, therefore we &s;hall omit their de&s;crip|tion; their fowls, and game are very numerous.</P>
<P>The buildings are erected in the Italian &s;tile: the u&s;ual dwellings are of wood; but the churches are of &s;tone. Their way of travelling is much the &s;ame as in Germany, but the roads are very bad. The lower grounds are deep in water, and the mountainous part of the country is inconvenient for wheel-carriages; which in winter are &s;upplied by &s;ledges on the ice, both on the higher and lower parts of the country.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of Bohemia, we have noticed that this province principally belongs to Pru&s;&s;ia. It is formed of different &s;ects in their religion. His late maje&s;ty, <HI>Frederick</HI> II. king of Pru&s;&s;ia, at the peace of Berlin, in 1742, permitted the Popi&s;h religion to continue in

<HI>&s;tatu quo,</HI> though without detriment to the freedom of con&s;cience of his Prote&s;tant inhabitants, or to his own prerogative, as &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The reformation in Sile&s;ia was fir&s;t introduced in 1522, by the principality of Lignitz, under the au&s;pices of <HI>Frederick</HI> II. duke of Lignitz. Bre&s;lau and Schwednitz &s;oon embraced Lutherani&s;m: and after the&s;e followed almo&s;t every principal town of the provinces in Sile&s;ia. The Aug&s;burg confe&s;&s;ion was granted by the emperor as a toleration for its free exerci&s;e. Schools were publickly permitted. Yet after the death of <HI>Rodolphus</HI> II. em|peror of Germany, great violence was u&s;ed to bring the prote&s;tants into the pale of the Romi&s;h church.</P>
<P>The celebrated <HI>Charles</HI> the XIIth, king of Sweden, interfered in behalf of the Lutherans in 1707, and ob|tained for them a free exerci&s;e of their religion. In this famous convention, the Calvini&s;ts were not included, con&s;equently the fiery zealots of the Romi&s;h per&s;ua&s;ion &s;oon found means to extirpate them. However, after &s;ome remon&s;trances and petitions the late great <HI>Frede|rick</HI> II. king of Pru&s;&s;ia recalled them, and gave them leave to exerci&s;e their mode of religious wor&s;hip public|ly in Bre&s;lau, and &s;everal other parts of this province.

<P>The Germanic body is obliged to take into its defence and protection the kingdom of Bohemia with all its de|pendencies, and, of cour&s;e, Sile&s;ia is included.

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF HUNGARY. From <HI>Bu&s;ching, Brown, Key&s;ler, Rie&s;bec, Moore, Montagu, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Country, Climate, and Productions.</HEAD>
<P>HUNGARY, with its incorporated countries, Scla|vonia, Dalmatia, Bo&s;nia, Servia, and Tran&s;ylva|nia, &amp;c. is bounded by the Carpathian Mountains in the north, dividing it from Poland; by Walachia on the we&s;t; by Germany on the ea&s;t; by Venetian Dalma|tia and the Adriatic Sea on the &s;outh ea&s;t, and by Euro|pean Turkey on the &s;outh; lying between 45 and 49 de|grees
<PB N="256" REF="299">
of north latitude, and from the 16th to the 22d degree of longitude from the meridian of London. Its northern parts are mountainous and barren; but its &s;outh|ern, level, warm, and fruitful.</P>
<P>The plains of Hungary are clear and open, and if compared with our Engli&s;h plains, as Sali&s;bury, Lin|coln, and Newmarket, exceed them in &s;ize, as a full grown man does a child. I have travelled, &s;ays <HI>Brown,</HI> from Vienna to Belgrade through one continued plain for 400 miles, without any eminencies, except one incon|&s;iderable wood near Bacna, beyond Dotis. Upper Hun|gary has good &s;tore of woods and hills, yet interming|led with large plains. Hungary, with the incorporated provinces, contains 4760 &s;quare Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P>The air is very unwhole&s;ome, e&s;pecially to foreigners; the days in &s;ummer being exce&s;&s;ive hot, and the nights intolerably cold. Hungary has been called the German &s;oldier's grave, generally producing a fever, which fir&s;t &s;hews it&s;elf by nodes and tubercles on the hands and arms. The plague comes here from Turkey, and &s;preads by contagion. The Carpathian mountains are over-run at bottom with common trees; higher up, with larger ones, and at a greater interval, which makes, as it were the third region, with bru&s;h-wood. The &s;ummit is a chaos of frightful crags and precipices, continually covered with &s;now, and lakes of very tran&s;parent water lying between them.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="300">In rivers this country perhaps excells any other in Europe; on the ea&s;t, it has that noble river Teys, or Ti|bi&s;cus, ri&s;ing in the Carpathian mountains, and joining its current with the Danube, between Waradin and Bel|grade; on the we&s;t, is the Araba, which empties into the Danube; on the &s;outh, are two con&s;iderable rivers, the Drave and the Save, which run each a cour&s;e of 300 miles, and empty al&s;o into the Danube; and on the north, are two rivers joining likewi&s;e the Danube.</P>
<P>The Danube is the greate&s;t of the whole, being &s;wel|led by the junction of other rivers. Its runs quite through Hungary, receiving in its cour&s;e 120 rivers, 60 of which are navigable, and di&s;charges it&s;elf by &s;everal outlets with &s;uch violence into the Black Sea, that both the &s;tream and water are perceptible in it for &s;everal miles di&s;tance. It begins to be navigable near Ulm in Suabia, pa&s;&s;es by Ingol&s;tadt, Rati&s;bon, Shawbing, Lentz and Vienna to Pre&s;burg, and thence continues its cour&s;e 300 miles through Hungary to Belgrade.</P>
<P>No river has &s;uch large and well peopled i&s;lands as the Danube, for example, the i&s;le of St. Andrew's, betwixt Vicegrade and Vacia; another a little below Buda, again&s;t the we&s;t &s;ide of which &s;tands Adom, 40 Engli&s;h miles long, and containing many villages; an|other oppo&s;ite to Mohatz, another at the confluence of the Drave and Danube, and another new one near Bel|grade, where, till within this century, there was not the
<PB N="258" REF="301">
lea&s;t trace of an i&s;land to be &s;een. Be&s;ides, no river at &s;uch a di&s;tance from its mouth, can boa&s;t of &s;o many con&s;iderable, naval engagements as the Danube. The Emperor keeping gallies at Vienna, Pre&s;burgh, and Co|morrah, as do the Turks at Strigonum, Buda, Belgrade, &amp;c. In Turki&s;h hi&s;tory we are told, that at a &s;iege of Belgrade, there appeared 200 gallies and other armed ve&s;&s;els, and that the&s;e were &s;o &s;martly engaged by the Chri&s;tian fleet, that be&s;ides what were taken, the Turks were obliged to fire their own &s;hips, to prevent their fall|ing into the hands of the enemy. The Chri&s;tians al&s;o had a fleet of 24 gallies, and 80 other armed ve&s;&s;els, be|&s;ides tenders and &s;hips of burden at the &s;iege of Buda. And when <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent lay before Vienna, the Imperial admiral coming out of Pre&s;burgh, &s;unk the Turki&s;h ve&s;&s;els, which carried the heavy cannon intended for battering the walls.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o two remarkable lakes, one in the pala|latinate of Simigen, eight German miles long, and two broad, and another between the palatinates of Olden|burg and Wie&s;&s;elburg.</P>
<P>The&s;e rivers and lakes abound with fi&s;h. The Teys is &s;o well &s;tocked, that a thou&s;and carps have been &s;old for a crown, and in &s;ome places fi&s;h are &s;o plentiful, that they feed their hogs with them.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="302">Whil&s;t &s;peaking of the waters, I mu&s;t not omit to mention the many &s;alutary hot baths with which this country abounds. The natural baths of Buda are the noble&s;t in Europe, not only in re&s;pect of the large&s;t hot &s;prings, but in the magnificence of the buildings. I will &s;peak of the&s;e when de&s;cribing Buda.</P>
<P>In the di&s;trict of Torner, in the ea&s;tern part of Upper Hungary at Sz&eacute;litz, near Torna, is a wonderful cavern in a mountain. The aperture which fronts the &s;outh is 18 fathoms high, and eight broad, and of cour&s;e wide enough to receive the &s;outh wind, which generally blows here with great violence. Its &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages con&s;i&s;t entirely of &s;olid rock, &s;tretching away further &s;outh than has yet been di&s;covered. As far as it is practicable to go, the height is found to be 50 fathoms, and the breadth 26. But the mo&s;t unaccountable &s;ingularity in this ca|vern is, that, in the heart of winter, the air is warm in the in&s;ide, and, when the heat of the &s;un without is &s;carce &s;upportable, freezing cold within. When the &s;now melts in &s;pring, the in&s;ide of the cavern, where its &s;urface is expo&s;ed to the &s;ultry &s;un, emits a pellucid water, which congeals as it drops, by the extreme cold: the icicles are of the &s;ize of a large ca&s;k, and &s;preading into rarifica|tions, form very odd figures. It is ob&s;erved al&s;o that the greater the heat without, the colder it is within, and in the dog-days all parts are covered with ice. The in|habitants u&s;e it for cooling the warm &s;prings; they thaw it al&s;o and drink the water. In autumn, when the nights
<PB N="260" REF="303">
grow cold, and the diurnal heat abates, the ice in the cave begins to di&s;&s;olve &s;o fa&s;t, that by winter, no more ice is to be &s;een. The cavern then becomes perfectly dry and warm. At this time it is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee the &s;warms of flies and gnats, of bats and owls, of hares and foxes, that make this place their winter-retreat, till in the beginning of &s;pring it grows too cold for them. Above the cavern the hill ri&s;es to a very great height, and on the &s;outhern a&s;pect produces plenty of rich gra&s;s.</P>
<P>The Hungarians have many &s;pecies of wild bea&s;ts, &s;uch as wolves, bears, lynxes, &amp;c. va&s;t plenty of game, great &s;tore of &s;heep, &s;ome with &s;piral horns and long curled wool, and &s;uch prodigious numbers of oxen, that 100,000 are &s;ent annually to other countries; and they are all a&s;h coloured, or white. They have al&s;o plenty of buffalos, with which they plough their &s;tiff lands. Their hor&s;es are rather &s;mall but &s;wift, and in the woods are bred the mo&s;t active, hardy, and &s;pirited race, for their &s;ize, in the world. They have been found very u&s;eful in war, and the Hu&s;&s;ars, or light dragoons, of the Au&s;trian army are mounted on them. They are mo&s;tly mou&s;e-coloured. Even their poultry is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by their &s;ize and &s;hape. In &s;hort, all that breathes here atte&s;ts either by its growth or agility, the wonderful vigour of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="304">Hungary is, without doubt, the riche&s;t part of the Au|&s;trian dominions. It not only produces every thing that is produced in other countries, but feeds them with its overflow, and excels them as much in the quality, as in the quantity of what it produces. It has &s;uch a &s;uper|fluity of the nece&s;&s;aries and enjoyments of life, that a traveller has &s;aid of it, <HI>Extra Hungariam non e&s;t vita, &amp; &s;i e&s;t, non e&s;t ita;</HI> that is, <Q>Out of Hungary there is no living, or if there be living, it is not life.</Q> But here we have great occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve the truth of that ax|iom, that the more nature does for man, the le&s;s he commonly does for him&s;elf. The inhabitant of the Swi&s;s mountains extracts his &s;u&s;tenance from his nakedne&s;s, and has changed wilderne&s;&s;es into cultivated and inhabi|ted lands; the Hollander has turned the muddy &s;ands of the Rhine and Mae&s;e, what the &s;ea is con&s;tantly di&s;|puting with him, into a garden, whil&s;t the excellent grounds in Hungary &s;till lie wa&s;te. Not only a great part of this fruitful land is uncultivated, but even that which is, is not turned to near the advantage it might be. They never dre&s;s their lands, &s;uffer more than half the ground to lie fallow, and their common mode of beating out the grain, is by driving oxen, as did the ancients, among the corn, by which half of it is lo&s;t. In travelling over this country, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> you think your&s;elf going over a wild, though, in fact, you are upon a &s;oil, which with little trouble would produce 50, 60, or even a hundred|fold. The roads are of an immen&s;e breadth, and the fields adjoining them of &s;o little value, that the po&s;til|lions
<PB N="262" REF="305">
drive through them without the lea&s;t ceremony, whenever a little mud or rain, in the highway, reminds them of its being more convenient.</P>
<P>The inhabitants excu&s;e their bad farming, by the little value which grain bears. Every thing indeed is very cheap in this country. They &s;ay that if their har|ve&s;ts were ten times greater, they &s;hould gain nothing by them. There may be &s;ome truth in this, but the fault is certainly owing to bad government, for the va|lue of grain would undoubtedly increa&s;e with an increa&s;ed population, but &s;trange as it is, &s;ays <HI>Ric&s;bec,</HI> government rather &s;eeks to di&s;courage than promote agriculture.</P>
<P>The exportation of Hungarian wines, one of the riche&s;t products of the country, and which if it were free, would ruin the &s;ale of French wines in the north, is clogged with innumerable ob&s;tacles, left the trade of Au&s;trian wines &s;hould be hurt. Their grapes are both large and of a lu&s;cious flavour. Their Tokay wine is in high e&s;timation. There are near 30 &s;orts of Hun|garian wine &s;old at Vienna. They improve their lands only by paring and burning, and in&s;tead of barns or hay and corn-&s;tacks, they &s;tow their harve&s;t away, in deep and &s;pacious caves under-ground, where they retire al&s;o with their families, in ca&s;e of inva&s;ion by the Turks or Tartars. Their bread is very light, owing to their kneading it long, and very cheap; as much may be bought for 2<HI>d.</HI> as is &s;old in England for 12<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="306">The artificial appearance of the country is as re|markable as the natural. In one place, perhaps you &s;ee palaces upon which art has exhau&s;ted all its magnificence, and within a few paces you come to countries where men dwell in caverns like wild bea&s;ts. At Pre&s;burg, Port and O&s;&s;en, which are the large&s;t cities in the country, and each of which contains 30,000 men, you believe your|&s;elf in the mo&s;t enchanted country in the world; and within a few miles of their gates, you &s;eem to be in Mingrelia.</P>

<P>I will now &s;peak of the Hungarian mines. I mean the gold mines of Cremnitz, Konig&s;berg, Schemnitz, &amp;c. all dependant on Au&s;tria, having been formerly mort|gaged to Au&s;tria by the kings of Hungary. There are &s;even of the&s;e mine-towns, to which belong four lord|&s;hips,

three days journey in length, extending to the borders of Poland. The &s;upreme officer here is the commi&s;&s;ioner of the revenue. All monies pa&s;s through his hands, and he judges, without appeal, both in civil and criminal cau&s;es; he has 83 officers under him. His appointment is 4000 guldens a year, and 450 for the expence of his table, (a gulden is 2<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> Engli&s;h.)</P>
<P>The&s;e mines are the &s;upport of many thou&s;ands, and the expence of working the whole amounts yearly to 100,000 guldens. Pure, gold ore, like that of Tran&s;yl|vania is here found in the Hungarian mines, but the lat|ter yields gold ore with a mixture of &s;ilver or lead. A quintal of the riche&s;t ore yields 35 ounces of &s;ilver; but &s;ome that is refined does not yield more than two ounces in a hundred weight. That which yields lea&s;t &s;il|ver, contains mo&s;t gold. The mine of Schemnitz an|nually produces &s;omething above five quintals of gold, and, with the alloy, half an ounce of gold makes five du|cats, each ducat 9s. 6d. Engli&s;h. In the general mint from all the&s;e towns, near 100,000 ducats are coined yearly; yet &s;ome affirm that the annual clear profits of the&s;e works amount to 60,000 guldens, the Emperor's &s;hare only.</P>
<P>As a precaution again&s;t mal-practices, or embezzle|ment, all the officers and per&s;ons employed here, are &s;worn, and excluded from having any &s;hare in the mines. The workmen labour eight hours, and are then relieved.
<PB N="265" REF="308">
One of the mines at Schemnitz, (which is the large&s;t of all the mine-towns; is well built, has three ca&s;tles, and three hand&s;ome churches) is 70 fathoms deep, built and kept open with under-work, at a va&s;t expence; the greate&s;t part of it being a rocky &s;oil. The ore is very rich, and generally blue, covered with a white clay. The ore runs in veins, and as they have no certain method of knowing where they lie, they proceed by gue&s;s, and per|&s;evere in their labour till they meet with them. There is one place where they dug for &s;ix &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, and when they at la&s;t di&s;covered the vein, they found it but two fathoms di&s;tant from the place where they fir&s;t be|gan to dig. There is another place where they dug 12 years, before they found the vein, but this proved &s;o rich, as to pay them well in a &s;hort time. Within the mines, they have large wheels, 36 feet in diameter, turned by &s;ubterranean &s;treams, which work engines that pump up the collected water. The &s;treams that turn the&s;e wheels are not &s;uffered to run into the mines, but are carried off by trunks, and horizontal pa&s;&s;ages. On the top, or out&s;ide of the mines are wheels turned by 10 or 12 hor&s;es, that pump up the water al&s;o.</P>
<P>The gold mine at Chremnitz has been worked near 1000 years, and is nine or ten Engli&s;h miles in length. It has one cuniculus or horizontal pa&s;&s;age, 800 fathoms long, and its depth is 170 fathoms, into which the miners are let down in a kind of leather &s;eat, fa&s;tened at the end of a cable, and the cable turned by a wheel.
<PB N="266" REF="309">
Such cables are worth 7 or 800 guldens each, and will not la&s;t above eight or ten weeks. In the&s;e mines the air is &s;ometimes very cold, and &s;ometimes &s;o hot that the miners work naked.</P>
<P>The gold ore is &s;ometimes white, &s;ometimes black, &s;ome red, and &s;ome yellow, but the white, with black &s;pots, is accounted the be&s;t. There have been pieces of pure gold found in this mine, as large as the palm of the hand, but &s;uch pieces are very rare. In the Empe|ror's mu&s;eum at Vienna, is &s;hewn a vine-&s;tock, with a gold wire twining round it, which it is &s;aid naturally grew thus out of the earth. It was found in a vineyard near Tokay, in the year 1670, and pre&s;ented to the Em|peror as a mo&s;t extraordinary curio&s;ity. Tokay is re|markable for its excellent wine, and the &s;pot of land that produces this wine is &s;even Hungarian, or 56 Eng|li&s;h miles in circumference. This tract is inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;everal towns; and as Tokay is not a proper liquor for common drinkers, if all the wa&s;te lands in this di&s;|trict was cultivated, no part of Europe would be without Tokay wine at a moderate price.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ional damps in the&s;e mines have de&s;troyed numbers of miners at a time, when they have not been prepared again&s;t them. The method of pre&s;erving the gold, is by fir&s;t grinding and draining the ore, then wa&s;hing it, and after all melting the &s;ediment.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="310">The number of the &s;everal labourers, &amp;c. employed in the mines of Schemnitz, amounts to 5 or 6000 men, and tho&s;e without the mines are computed at 2000, ex|clu&s;ive of tho&s;e employed about the carriages: 1500 hor&s;es are u&s;ually taken up for the&s;e works, and a little carriage with two hor&s;es is hired for about &s;ix or &s;even guldens per week. The Emperor's expences in the Schemnitz mines alone, is yearly near 59,000l. Out of 128 &s;hares, the Emperor has 123, the other five are pri|vate property. Some noble families are &s;ettled in the mine-towns, and the greater part of their income ari&s;es from the mines. At Hana, near Eperiez, is dug a whiti&s;h ore, which yields a great deal of quick&s;ilver, extracted <HI>per de&s;cen&s;um.</HI></P>
<P>Within &s;ix Engli&s;h miles of Chremnitz, is a warm bath, about the heat of the king's bath, at Bath, much fre|quented, and where both &s;exes bathe promi&s;cuou&s;ly; the men wearing only a kind of drawers, and the women a &s;hift wrapped over their heads.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Cities.</HEAD>
<P>GRAN was formerly the capital of Hungary, till the Hungarians lo&s;t it; thence Buda became the capital; now Pre&s;burg is the metropolis. It is a regu|lar city, &s;ituated in a &s;pacious plain, on the banks of the Danube, at the foot of a mountain. Pre&s;burg it&s;elf is ill-built, the hou&s;es of the town, properly &s;o called, not much exceeding two hundred, and the whole &s;trength of its fortifications con&s;i&s;ts in a double wall and a moat. But the &s;uburbs are large and hand&s;ome, and contain four univer&s;ities, with churches, and two ho&s;pitals. Pre&s;burg lies in latitude 48 deg. 8 min. and is only 40 Engli&s;h miles di&s;tant from Vienna. Some of the &s;ub|urbs ri&s;e on a &s;teep hill, and the citadel or ca&s;tle &s;tands on the top of it. It is a grand, quadrangular, Gothic building, with four towers at the corners, exactly alike, and is the u&s;ual re&s;idence of Prince <HI>Albert</HI> of Saxony. From this citadel is a very exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, com|manding the va&s;t and fertile plains of Hungary, to|wards Belgrade. The crown, and other regalia of Hungary are left in one of the above-mentioned tow|ers, but as the entrance to this ca&s;tle is through three iron doors, the guards po&s;ted between the two fir&s;t doors, by means of a grate can &s;ee every one that comes up the &s;teps, leading to the entrance. In
<PB N="269" REF="312">
the lower &s;uburbs is a hill, where the king of Hungary, at his coronation, goes in great &s;tate on hor&s;e-back, and brandi&s;hes his &s;word towards the four cardinal points, to &s;ignify that he is determined to protect his frontiers from enemies on all &s;ides. In this city the &s;tates of Hungary hold their a&s;&s;emblies, and in the cathedral church the Sovereign is crowned. The regalia, con&s;i&s;ting of the crown and &s;ceptre of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> their fir&s;t king, are here carefully &s;ecured by &s;even locks, the keys of which are kept by the &s;ame number of Hungarian noblemen. No prince is legally their &s;overeign till he is crowned with the diadem of king <HI>Stephen;</HI> and they have a notion that the fate of their nation depends on the crown's remain|ing in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It has therefore been moved, in times of danger, to places of the greate&s;t &s;afety.</P>
<P>Old Buda is in 47 degrees 40 minutes north latitude, lying on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Danube, ninety miles from Pre&s;burg. It &s;tands in a plain extending it&s;elf from the &s;uburbs of New Buda to the Pellis mountains; at pre&s;ent it is a poor mean place, belonging to the Zichy fa|mily: in, and about it, are many ruins, with &s;everal Roman monuments. New Buda is &s;ituated on a moun|tain on the Danube, was formerly the capital of the kingdom, the re&s;idence of the king, and the large&s;t and fine&s;t of all the Hungarian towns, but having been of|ten be&s;ieged, taken, and de&s;troyed, it is now very much reduced. The city lies on the declivity of the moun|tain, and its ca&s;tle &s;tands on the top of it. The Je&s;uits
<PB N="270" REF="313">
here have an academical college, and a &s;eminary; the Carmelite nuns have convents, and the Franci&s;cans have churches. The city is &s;urrounded with walls and moats, and well fortified. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river &s;tands the town of Pe&s;th, in a plain, the river being cro&s;&s;ed by a bridge of boats: here is the &s;upreme court of appeal, and a large military ho&s;pital, built with &s;tone, 200 paces &s;quare, and three &s;tories high: the town is &s;urrounded with a wall and moat, contains &s;ix convents, and &s;everal churches.</P>
<P>At Buda are &s;ome natural warm baths, which, when the Turks po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the place, from 1529 to 1686, were the noble&s;t in Europe, not only in re&s;pect to the &s;ize and heat of the &s;prings, but in the magnifi|cence of the buildings: the&s;e baths are &s;even in num|ber. The emperor's bath is built in the manner of the rotunda at Rome, with a large aperture in the centre of the cupola, be&s;ides &s;everal &s;mall holes or windows for admitting more light into the dome. The emperor's bath, with a pond of mineral water, has this &s;urprizing property, that when the water is wholly turned off, the warm &s;prings cea&s;e flowing; but when the pond is filled a little above half full, they return again: the heat is nearly that of the water at Bath in England. The exhala|tion of the emperor's baths, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Brown,</HI> reverberated by the cupola, form long &s;tones, like icicles, which hang down from the capitals of the pillars and irons, which extend from one column to another, as is ob&s;erved in
<PB N="271" REF="314">
&s;ome other &s;ubterraneous grottos, for the cupola is &s;up|ported with large columns; and though there are many openings to let out the &s;team, yet the whole &s;eems like a hot &s;tove. In the great bath the anti-chamber is very large, the bathing-room &s;pacious, high arched, and adorned with five cupolas; one over the round bath in the middle, and one le&s;s at each of the four corners, where are bathing rooms for private u&s;es. Twelve pil|lars &s;upport the great cupola, between eight of which are fountains of hot water, and between the others are places to &s;it down, where the barber and &s;ervants of the bath attends, and in each of the&s;e places are two ci&s;terns of free-&s;tone, into which they let hot and cold water, as the company like. In the large bath both &s;exes pub|lickly bathe together, the men wearing only a kind of drawers, and the women what they call a fine &s;hift; but the common people, for whom the Raizen bath is ap|pointed, look even upon this &s;light cloathing as &s;uper|fluous. <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> tells us, a wide &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, leading from Old Buda to the citadel, has been lately di&s;|covered, and that it was a way well-known to the Turks. The wine of this place has a good flavour, is red, and much re&s;embles French wine. Be&s;ides grapes, Buda is famous for fine melons, which &s;ell for one penny Eng|li&s;h, each.</P>
<P>The mode of bathing, according to Dr. <HI>Brown,</HI> is as follows; being brought into the anti-chamber, the ba|ther is furni&s;hed with a cloth and apron; when &s;tripped,
<PB N="272" REF="315">
he puts on the apron, goes into the bath-room, where, &s;itting down between the pillars near a fountain, he is well rubbed, and his hands and arms &s;tretched out by the barber, who next &s;haves his head and beard, ex|cept the upper lip, and then proceeds to rub his brea&s;t, back, arms, and legs, with a hair cloth; the bather ei|ther &s;itting, or lying on his belly. Then, the barber having wa&s;hed the head with &s;oap, and thrown cold water over the body, the bather walks in the &s;team of the bath for &s;ome time, and afterwards bathes.</P>
<P>The nobility here have their villas as in England. The following de&s;cription of one is taken from <HI>Moore,</HI> who went to vi&s;it a nobleman about four miles from Pre&s;burg. His hou&s;e is delightfully &s;ituated, but his gardens laid out a little too methodically; the park, however, and fields, where le&s;s art had been u&s;ed, di&s;|play a va&s;t luxuriancy of natural beauties. Whil&s;t wan|dering over the&s;e, we entered a little wood, in a very retired place, where was a figure of painted wood dre&s;&s;ed in a hermit's garb to deceive pa&s;&s;engers, and well exe|cuted, &s;tretching out his hand, as if to invite people to his hermitage hard by; over the door was this in&s;cription from <HI>Horace;</HI> but which for the ladies is Engli&s;hed:

<P>But of all the rural re&s;idences, that of E&s;therha&s;ie is the fir&s;t, being the palace of the prince of that name. He is the fir&s;t in rank of all the Hungarian nobility, and one of the mo&s;t magnificent &s;ubjects in Europe. He has body-guards of his own, all genteel looking men, richly dre&s;&s;ed in the Hungarian manner.</P>
<P>E&s;therha&s;ie is about 60 miles from Vienna. The pa|lace is a noble building, lately fini&s;hed, and &s;ituated
<PB N="274" REF="317">
near a fine lake. The apartments are grand and con|venient, containing a greater variety of &s;plendid furni|ture than mo&s;t royal palaces can boa&s;t of. In the prince's private apartments are &s;ome mu&s;ical clocks, and one in the form of a bird that whi&s;tles a tune every hour.</P>
<P>Adjoining the palace is an opera-hou&s;e, &s;mall, but neat and elegant; and in the gardens a large &s;aloon, and a commodious &s;uite of rooms for ma&s;querades and balls. In this opera-hou&s;e, the performers of Venice are often engaged by the prince to perform Italian operas. If any &s;trangers are at that time in the town, he &s;ends to them, and invites them to the exhibition, and the doors are open to all the country people around about. The ce|lebrated Haydn is his compo&s;er, at an annual &s;alary.</P>
<P>He has al&s;o another theatre for puppet-&s;hows, much larger, and more commodious than mo&s;t country play|hou&s;es; and Dr. <HI>Moore</HI> tells us it is the mo&s;t &s;plendid of its kind he ever &s;aw. He did not &s;ee any piece per|formed, but was a&s;&s;ured they were the be&s;t comedians in Hungary. "I had" &s;ays he "the curio&s;ity to peep behind the curtain, and &s;aw kings, emperors, turks, and chri&s;tians, all ranged very &s;ociably together: king <HI>Solomon</HI> was in a corner in a very &s;u&s;picious <HI>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</HI> with the queen of Sheba.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="318">Among other curio&s;ities at this palace is a wooden hou&s;e in the garden, built upon wheels. It contains a room, with a table, chairs, a looking gla&s;s, chimney and fire-place, with clo&s;ets, and many nece&s;&s;ary accom|modations. Twelve per&s;ons may &s;it round this table, and the prince has often entertained a company at din|ner, whil&s;t they have taken an airing round the garden, and many parts of his park, which are as level as a bowling green; the vehicle, thus loaded, is drawn ea&s;ily by &s;ix or eight hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The gardens are of va&s;t extent, and beautiful beyond de&s;cription, being diver&s;ified with woods, hills, valleys, walks, fountains, and arbours. And the de&s;cription of Alcina's enchanted i&s;land, will give, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> a very good idea of the romantic fields of E&s;therha&s;ie; and which are inhabited by the &s;ame kind of animals.</P>

<L>To crop, or ruminate their gra&s;&s;y food.</L></Q>
<P>Baron <HI>Rie&s;bech</HI> tells us, that this prince's e&s;tate does not amount to more than 600,000 guldens a year, and yet there is no place in France, except Ver&s;ailles, equal to E&s;therha&s;ie in magnificence. The ca&s;tle is im|men&s;ely
<PB N="276" REF="319">
large, and the garden and grounds contain every thing that human invention could contrive for its improvement, or rather for the pre&s;ervation of nature. The pavillions of all kinds appear to be the habitations of &s;o many fairies, and every thing is &s;o much above what you meet with in general, that when we behold it, we are led to think, we are dreaming. But what ren|ders the magnificence of this place more &s;triking &s;till, is the very extraordinary contra&s;t of the country round it. The lake of Neu&s;redler, which is not far from the ca&s;tle, forms a large mora&s;s, extending &s;everal miles, and threatening in time to lay this great edifice under water, as it has already done great part of the country. The inhabitants of the places around are afflicted annually with a fever, and look like &s;o many &s;pectres, and with|in a day's journey of the ca&s;tle we meet with Calmucks, Cherokees, Hottentots, and the inhabitants of Terra del Fuego, in all their &s;everal occupations and &s;ituations. All the country between the Danube and Lower Au&s;|tria, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Brown</HI> and <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> is one exten&s;ive plain, and in &s;ome places &s;o &s;andy, that the pea&s;ants have their habitations under ground, like the Troglodytes and the &s;ubterranean nations about Egypt; and have wells from whence they draw their water, as we do our&s;elves in England. Their hou&s;es are tolerably well contrived within, divided by partitions with wooden chimnies, and a window at one end a little above ground, all the re&s;t buried in the &s;and. All things within are neatly kept, but betray a poverty: indeed &s;ome hou&s;es are &s;o

We have given a print of &s;uch a &s;cene, and have taken the opportunity of introducing, a &s;ketch of a monument &s;aid to be that of the famous Latin poet, <HI>Ovid,</HI> who be|ing recalled from his bani&s;hment at Tomos, near the Euxine &s;ea, died at Sabaria, in Hungary, in his return home; and where they &s;ay this tomb was found with the following epitaph made by him&s;elf.</P>

<P>In Engli&s;h thus: "Here lies one whom the wrath of Cae&s;ar bani&s;hed from his native country. Often has the wretched wi&s;hed to be buried with his fathers, but in vain. Fate has laid this man here."</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the People, Manners, Cu&s;toms, Trade, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no country in the world which has a greater variety of inhabitants than Hungary. The ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the country were Tartars, and Scla|vonians. Among&s;t the former we may reckon the Hungarians, now properly &s;o called; for their manners and appearance plainly &s;hew that they are of kin to the Calmucks, and de&s;cendants of the old Scythians. Their deep eyes, angular cheek-bones, and yellow &s;kins, di&s;|tingui&s;h them from the Sclavonians, who, be&s;ides, are whiter, more fle&s;hy, and &s;tronger built. There are &s;everal parts of the country, in which both races are continued pure and unmixed. And be&s;ides all the&s;e, there are Germans, Walachians, Bulgarians, Turks, Greeks, Armenians, Jews, and Gyp&s;ies, which la&s;t are the riche&s;t of all foreigners.</P>
<P>All the&s;e people, a few of the German coloni&s;ts, and the higher nobility excepted, who are modelled after the fa&s;hion of the court of Vienna, are &s;till in a barbarous &s;tate. Indeed, it mu&s;t be owned, that the Court, in|&s;tead of &s;ucceeding in improving them, as it has done the re&s;t of its &s;ubjects, has rather done them harm than good, by the attempts it has made for the purpo&s;e.
<PB N="279" REF="323">
Whil&s;t they were left to them&s;elves, they were warlike, and like the children of nature, whom a fal&s;e policy had not &s;poiled, open-hearted, ho&s;pitable, frank, and &s;teady to their purpo&s;es. Experience, as well as true philo&s;ophy teach us that partly by religion any &s;tate may be &s;ucce&s;s|ful in civilizing a barbarian: any other attempt, any other re&s;triction, which tends to cure him of his vices, with|out &s;hewing him the advantage of virtue to him&s;elf, only makes a motley compo&s;ition of the faults of the two &s;tates.</P>
<P>On the very a&s;pect of things one &s;ees that the govern|ment of this country is in&s;idious. The intere&s;ts of the higher nobility are different from tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the country; their under-tenants, which make the greate&s;t part of the people, are not feudal &s;ubjects, neither have they any real property; they are farmers who may be turned out of their farms upon the lea&s;t di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The nobility contributes nothing but free gifts to the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate, though it is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of half the property of the country. It is almo&s;t the only order in the &s;tate, for, from the higher orders of the&s;e the prie&s;thood is cho&s;en, &s;o that the intere&s;t of the&s;e two or|ders is one. In &s;hort, the boa&s;ted freedom of Hungary is only a privilege of the nobility and clergy to live at the expence of the whole country.</P>
<P>In general, the Hungarians are of a good &s;tature, and well proportioned. The men are of a martial appear|ance,
<PB N="280" REF="324">
but the women are exceedingly fair, and &s;ome very beautiful. The dre&s;s of the men, con&s;i&s;ts of a fur cap, a clo&s;e-bodied coat girt about with a &s;a&s;h, and over this a cloak or mantle, which comes no lower than the hips, and is &s;o contrived as to be buc|kled under one arm, &s;o that the right hand is always at liberty.</P>
<P>The colours they affect in their cloaths are red, blue, or green. Young gentlemen have u&s;ually feathers in their caps. The women of fa&s;hion, as well as the men, imitate the French mode of dre&s;s, but neither &s;ex will leave off the &s;hort cloak, or toga. The ladies are ge|nerally veiled, when they go abroad. The men &s;have their beards, but leave whi&s;kers on the upper lip.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide a broad &s;word, the u&s;ual arms of an Hunga|rian are an iron mace, with a round head furrowed, and the balta, made in the form of a hatchet, with fire arms. The women's dre&s;s in the mine towns is not unbecoming. They wear knots of ribbons at their &s;hift &s;leeves, and others likewi&s;e hanging down their backs; but the pea&s;ants, and lower &s;ort of people among&s;t the miners, dre&s;s very meanly. Among the latter, the men are very proud of a furred mantle. Mo&s;t of the wo|men wear boots, and many of them a long furred gown, and have a kind of &s;hift of a very coar&s;e linen next their &s;kin, with a girdle round it at their wai&s;t. Their head
<PB N="281" REF="325">
dre&s;s is a piece of white linen with two lappets hanging down behind.</P>
<P>In this part of the kingdom &s;ky-blue is the mo&s;t u&s;ual colour worn by both &s;exes: the predilection of the peo|ple here for this colour, is, that it is an emblem of a cele&s;tial, or exalted mind.</P>
<P>The Hungarians pique them&s;elves on being de&s;|cended from tho&s;e heroes, who formed the bulwark of Chri&s;tiandom again&s;t the infidels. In the mine-towns both &s;exes among&s;t the lower cla&s;&s;es wear &s;heep-&s;kin garments. The natives, in general, are an indolent peo|ple, and leave trade and manufactures to the Greeks and other &s;trangers &s;ettled in their country. Their di|ver&s;ions are of the warlike and athletic kind.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Teme&s;war, a province lately in|corporated into the kingdom of Hungary, are com|puted at about 450,000. There are in this country many Faraons or Gyp&s;ies, &s;uppo&s;ed to be real de&s;cend|ants of the ancient Egyptians. They are &s;aid to re&s;em|ble the ancient Egyptians in their features, in their pro|pen&s;ity to melancholy, and in many of their manners and cu&s;toms: and it is a&s;&s;erted that the la&s;civious dances of I&s;is, the wor&s;hip of onions, many famous Egyptian &s;uper&s;titions and &s;pecifics, and the Egyptian method of hatching of eggs by means of dung, are &s;till in u&s;e among the female Gyp&s;ies in Teme&s;war.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="326">Hungary being plentifully watered with fine rivers, the u&s;ual way of travelling in &s;ummer is by water, and where they have not this conveniency, an open chariot, drawn by three or four hor&s;es a-brea&s;t, carries the tra|veller over this flat country with great expedition. They have al&s;o a very fleet breed of hor&s;es for riding, but ne|ver trim them, long tails and manes being con&s;idered as great ornaments. The Hu&s;&s;ars, or Hungarian troopers, who&s;e pay is &s;mall, are very trouble&s;ome to travellers, robbing all they meet, where they can do it with &s;e|curity.</P>
<P>Nor are tho&s;e numbers of the &s;turdy gyp&s;ies, that &s;warm in this country le&s;s dangerous, though they live in towns, and generally profe&s;s &s;ome handicraft trade. The wolves too are another great di&s;turbance on the road in the night-time, e&s;pecially where it happens to be through a wood.</P>
<P>The reader may readily conceive by the plenitude of the&s;e voracious animals, that Hungary is not well in|habited, otherwi&s;e this trouble&s;ome race of quadrupeds would be extirpated from off the face of the land. The great extent of uncultivated plains agreeably diver&s;ified with thickets and limpid &s;prings and meandring brooks, as well as the dark rece&s;&s;es of the numerous fore&s;ts, be|&s;peak the &s;afe retreat of the&s;e truly formidable race of quadrupeds: who, when pre&s;&s;ed by the wants of nature and the inclemency of the element, are as ravenous pro|bably
<PB N="283" REF="327">
as the lions were in the den, wherein the prophet Daniel was immerged.</P>
<P>The roads are &s;ometimes only the direction of a mount, a grove, or a po&s;t; as few foot&s;teps mark the beaten track &s;o well known in more populous &s;tates. The lonely woods know few of the human race to walk within their &s;helter. The &s;olitary groves and &s;till more plea&s;ing land&s;capes have no admirers to paint the beau|ties of the golden we&s;t, when the planet of the day &s;inks beneath the towering hill. The luxuriant &s;en&s;e wants no artificial colouring to delineate its beauties; every object con&s;pires to heighten the beauty of the horizontal boundary. On every hand the pro&s;pect varies, yet none to be rejected as le&s;s worthy of mental enjoyment and agreeable per&s;pective. All are equally novel, beautiful, and picture&s;que.</P>
<P>In the mountains near the town of Schemnitz; the hardne&s;s of the water produces wens of a great &s;ize. The&s;e excre&s;cences are almo&s;t univer&s;al among&s;t the in|habitants: but the water in the vallies, near that town, is &s;aid to be an efficacious remedy for them.</P>
<P>As we are under the head of travelling, we can|not omit the noble bridges that are to be met with in this country; particularly the bridge at E&s;&s;eck, built over the river Drave, and the mar&s;hy grounds be|yond
<PB N="284" REF="328">
it, being five miles long, and railed in with towers at every quarter of a mile's di&s;tance.</P>
<P>This has been a pa&s;s much contended for in the Turki&s;h wars, and occa&s;ioned many &s;mart engagements to gain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. There lies al&s;o a bridge of boats, half a mile long, between Buda and Pe&s;th; and a third over the Danube, between Gran and Barcan. But the bridge built over the Danube, 20 Hungarian miles from Belgrade, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the re&s;t, &s;ome of the ruins being vi&s;ible at this day. It con&s;i&s;ted of 20 piles of &s;quare &s;tone an 100 feet in height, the ba&s;is whereof contained 60 feet on every &s;ide of the &s;quare. The di&s;|tance between every one of the&s;e piles, or pillars, was 170 feet, and joined together by arches. And to per|petuate the memory of this bridge, many &s;ilver coins were &s;tamped with this in&s;cription, <HI>"Danubius."</HI></P>
<P>The manufactories of Hungary are very incon&s;ider|able, as hardware and copper are the chief articles of this de&s;cription. Their exports are, wine, oil, metals, minerals, cattle, leather, wool, tallow, and wax; and their imports are &s;pices, tin, &s;ilk, and a few other fo|reign commodities.</P>
<P>That their trade is no greater may be a&s;cribed to &s;e|veral cau&s;es, as fir&s;t, their's being an inland country, at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea. By the Danube indeed a very profitable navigation might be carried on to the coa&s;t
<PB N="285" REF="329">
of the Black &s;ea, and even to the Mediterranean; but as the Turks are ma&s;ters of the mouth of that river, no|thing of that kind can now be attempted.</P>
<P>If we may rely on the veracity of Baron <HI>Rie&s;bec,</HI> the exports amount to 24 millions a year, and the imports to 18, con&s;equently there is a balance of &s;ix millions an|nually in favour of the country.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the exports and imports, if compared, we &s;hall find it impo&s;&s;ible, but that the former is &s;tated too high; for with a balance of trade, as Hungary mu&s;t by this means have, it ought to be one of the riche&s;t countries in Europe. Whereas nothing is &s;carcer than money in this country.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider a little the variety of commodities which Hungary mu&s;t import from abroad, it is impo&s;|&s;ible it &s;hould have an equal trade; it is obliged to pur|cha&s;e all the products of art, be&s;ides an a&s;toni&s;hing num|ber of tho&s;e of nature. The quantity of the natural pro|duce on the other hand, given by Hungary to the &s;tran|ger, is very great; but that there remains a &s;urplus, we &s;cout the idea, as an improbability.</P>
<P>The negligence of the police in not &s;training the tor|rent of luxury is inconceivable. I have often been tempted to believe, &s;ays <HI>Rie&s;bec,</HI> that government did not think it worth its while to attend to the trade and
<PB N="286" REF="330">
commercial intere&s;ts of this country, either becau&s;e it did not yield in proportion to its greatne&s;s, or that the impetuous temper of the Court was &s;uch, as not to al|low of any e&s;tabli&s;hments that were to produce advan|tage to after ages. Be this as it may, whether the Court is all for pre&s;ent enjoyment, or has not political wi&s;dom enough to erect for futurity, the in&s;tances of its neg|lect are mo&s;t glaring. For, notwith&s;tanding the ex|treme poverty of the country, they allow the Jews to go about with coffee, &s;ugar, tobacco, oil, and quack medicines of all kinds, from village to village, where they &s;ell them in &s;mall quantities, and much adulte|rated.</P>
<P>With the power which the pre&s;ent Emperor <HI>Leopold</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es he might at once cut off all the privileges of the Hungarian nobles, which are contrary to the good of the whole, and which it has for &s;o many years been endeavouring to undermine. A few families would mur|mur for a while, but the thing would not go beyond murmurs; the inhabitants of the towns, and the pea|&s;ants would &s;tand up for the intere&s;ts of the Court, which are their own. The religious animo&s;ities, which &s;erved formerly as a pretence for an in&s;urrection, would no longer blind the people to their real good. It would open a liberality of &s;entiment that would &s;oon win over the nobility, whom the artifices now in u&s;e, only alie|nate and corrupt.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="331">If once that part of their privileges which militates again&s;t the good of the whole, was well defined, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, by one &s;ingle act of authority, they would then be &s;u&s;ceptible of patriotic virtues: whereas, at pre|&s;ent, they look upon the government to be ho&s;tile to them, and do nothing but what they are compelled to by power or bribes.</P>
<P>In that ca&s;e, the multitude or the inferior orders of the people would not be the abject &s;laves they now are: e&s;tabli&s;hments for polite accompli&s;hments would become general, and the gloom of de&s;poti&s;m and ignorance would &s;oon be removed by the lights of liberty and knowledge; and Hungary would, ere long, be one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing countries in Europe.</P>
<P>The natives would be no longer poor, in the mid&s;t of a country abounding with every nece&s;&s;ary of life. The poverty of the people, and the exce&s;&s;ive luxury and riches of the nobility, would no longer offend the eyes of the humane by the &s;hocking di&s;proportion between them. Then the lively native, animated by the love of his country, and a &s;en&s;e of his duty, would no longer refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to proper di&s;cipline, but gladly lay down his life in defence of his natural rights, his liberty and property; and, like a Briton, &s;erve his king, be|cau&s;e he is the father of his people, and guardian of their privileges.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="332">There is hardly a Hungarian of rank, at this day, &s;ays <HI>Rie&s;bec,</HI> that is either free from debt, or that does not, like the Au&s;trian man of fa&s;hion, look upon his debts as an honour. The court of Vienna has con&s;equently little to fear from the commotions of the higher ranks here, as all of them are &s;o &s;trongly attached to the modes of the capital of the German empire, that nothing &s;hort of a German lady, and a German equipage is the ton for a noble Hungarian. Therefore, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;|content which reigns in the brea&s;ts of the lower cla&s;s of Hungarians, yet, the want of a leader with power and con&s;equence, will always prohibit their ri&s;ings from being any ways dangerous.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;ipation of the Hungarians has bound them to the court of Vienna by an indi&s;&s;oluble tie, namely, their nece&s;&s;ities, which will no longer allow them to &s;erve for nothing, but make the pay of the Court an object to them. The Au&s;trian nobility, by privilege, take a mo&s;t unfair advantage, whenever they find a proper opportu|nity, and purcha&s;e Hungarian e&s;tates, in proportion as the owners are obliged to rai&s;e &s;upplies for the redemption of their honour, in di&s;charging their debts. Hence the German influence in Hungary is very great: nor is the national court at liberty to &s;hake off the yoke, which their own irregularities has obliged them to be burthened with.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="333">Now, it may be &s;aid of Hungary, that it is a mixed nation, at lea&s;t &s;o far as appertains to the fir&s;t cla&s;s of peo|ple; for the nobility, both laity and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, are nearly equally divided between natives and Au&s;trians.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what has been already &s;tated, the Court u&s;es &s;everal other means that depend upon time and circum|&s;tances. One of the mo&s;t efficacious is, the loading the produce of Hungary with very heavy taxes. The&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions indeed, immediately affect the nobility only, to whom the exports properly belong, as the re&s;t of the people have no property; but they hurt the whole country, and particularly the manufacturers and merchants in great towns, by the diminution of the coin in circulation.</P>
<P>The duties on the exports of Hungarian wines, are &s;o con&s;iderable that the Croats who inhabit the moun|tains are obliged to buy the wine, which, but for the&s;e duties, they might have very cheap from their fellow &s;ubjects in Venetian Dalmatia. The fact is, &s;ays the hone&s;t baron, the court of Vienna had rather let the country lo&s;e money than &s;uffer Hungary to be rich.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the employments of the country which the con&s;titution does not require to be given to natives are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Germans, who often prove the mo&s;t dread|ful de&s;pots. Thus in the cities of Illyria which depend intirely on the council of war, and are all under military
<PB N="290" REF="334">
government, almo&s;t all the employments are held by foreigners.</P>
<P>The Germans have made them&s;elves &s;o odious here by their tyranny, that the Croat knows no wor&s;e epithet, than that of <HI>"a Swabian;"</HI> under which is compre|hended every thing that is dete&s;table and contemptible. By the name of a Swabian the croat defines all the in|habitants of Germany, not excepting the Au&s;trian. For the natives of Au&s;tria who get footing in this country, behave there like Turki&s;h Pacha's, or Ea&s;t Indian Na|bobs. Their pride leads them to make the Hungarians feel that they are the ruling nation. Their di&s;&s;ipation compels them to u&s;e every extortion to procure money; and they are made &s;till wor&s;e than they otherwi&s;e would be, by the difference of their manners and religion. Thus, it is from the oppre&s;&s;ion of foreigners, that the native Illyrian has taken the di&s;hone&s;t and &s;tubborn part of his character, which otherwi&s;e is very unnatural to him.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the principal places are generally occupied by great men, it is impo&s;&s;ible to be more worthle&s;s than the greater number of the public &s;ervants are. Generally &s;peaking there is not a grain of patri|oti&s;m, a grain of knowledge, a grain of good will, or a grain of activity among&s;t them. Pride, vanity, &s;elf in|tere&s;t and hard-heartedne&s;s di&s;tingui&s;h them all. The only thing they look up to, continues the &s;ame author,
<PB N="291" REF="335">
are pay and titles, and treat bu&s;ine&s;s as a matter of indifference.</P>
<P>The native Hungarians who have a &s;hare in the go|vernment of their own country, have infinitely better under&s;tanding of the bu&s;ine&s;s and duties of their places, and more delight in di&s;charging them, than the Au&s;tri|ans; and yet the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s almo&s;t all the places, and the others are expo&s;ed to their tyranny. The Au&s;trians look upon it as indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to bind them in court chains, and take away every feeling of liberty and true honour from them. They do all they can to &s;tifle their national &s;pirit. They have no idea of ruling over a free and &s;entimental people, but conceive they mu&s;t make &s;laves of the whole nation, in order to govern it. The mo&s;t cruel violations of the national contract and the li|berty of mankind, have been tho&s;e which have ari&s;en on a religious account. It may therefore with &s;afety be af|firmed, that it will take two centuries to come, to undo the mi&s;chief which this Court hath done it&s;elf during the la&s;t hundred and fifty years, by the religious per&s;ecu|tions in Hungary. It is indeed one of tho&s;e contra|dictions which mo&s;t &s;eemingly be&s;peaks the debility of the human mind, that whil&s;t the Court of Vienna, on the one hand, does all it can, to promote the population and indu&s;try of this kingdom; on the other, it per&s;ecutes, in every po&s;&s;ible way, the indu&s;trious part of its &s;ubjects, and that part who&s;e religious opinions are the mo&s;t fa|vorable to population.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="336">The great fault of this government is, that they ba|ni&s;h the prote&s;tants who are the mo&s;t u&s;eful part of the &s;ubjects. But the want of freedom in religion explains it: it is greatly owing to this cau&s;e that all the u&s;eful men emigrate and leave Hunga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y only to the worthle&s;s ones. For it mu&s;t be owned the former can have but little de|&s;ire to &s;ettle in a country, in which they mu&s;t often go journies of &s;everal days, to &s;ee a prie&s;t of their own per|&s;ua&s;ion; where they are not allowed to build a church, and where the hatred towards them and their religion effectually and perpetually excludes them from all civil employments.</P>
<P>All the&s;e hindrances are removed under the gentle government of the Engli&s;h and Dutch, who of cour&s;e take all the u&s;eful emigrants, and leave Au&s;tria the mo&s;t inferior order. Tho&s;e that &s;ettle in Hungary, <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> affirms, to be the mo&s;t abandoned people, who emigrate from Bavaria, Swabia, Franconia, and the country about the Rhine. The&s;e, upon their arrival, generally &s;quander away the &s;mall &s;ums of money they have rai&s;ed at home&mdash;hence their exce&s;&s;es occa&s;ion many to die &s;uddenly, and have given the name of an unwhole&s;ome climate to Hun|gary, without any truth; for no country has a more &s;a|lubrious air and whole&s;ome mode of diet.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, &s;uch as they are, would &s;till be a con&s;iderable gain to &s;o poor a country as Hungary is, if Government was &s;ufficiently intere&s;ted in their fate, to
<PB N="293" REF="337">
provide for the exce&s;&s;es they mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to from the danger of the climate, and their own inexperience, and to give them &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their fir&s;t &s;ettlement. Hungary is in it&s;elf not more unwhole&s;ome than Italy, Spain, the &s;outh of France, or any other warm country; only, as there are mora&s;&s;es all over it, the difference be|tween the heat of the day and the cold of the night, mu&s;t be very &s;en&s;ibly felt by a German.</P>
<P>The rich wines and delicious fruits here to be met with, are equally pernicious to the &s;tranger, who mu&s;t guard again&s;t their dangerous influence. The regimen of the emigrant &s;hould be carefully copied from that of the native; for from the u&s;age of the inhabitant the favorable diet and exerci&s;e of any country may be ea&s;ily acquired.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Religion, Learning, Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancient inhabitants of this kingdom had &s;carce any devotion, but what they paid to their &s;word, which they look upon as the great pre&s;erver of their country, and the terror of their enemies.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian religion was introduced here about the year 1000, by king <HI>Stephen.</HI> The Hu&s;&s;ites of Bo|hemia propagated their opinions here in the 15th cen|tury, and in the 16th, <HI>Luther</HI>'s doctrine prevailed; but, like their neighbours, the Bohemians, they were divided into a multitude of &s;ects, and &s;ome of them not ea&s;ily defen&s;ible, having various &s;ingularities not e&s;&s;ential to the cau&s;e they e&s;pou&s;ed: however, all were known under the denomination of Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, about one fourth of the inhabitants of Hungary are Roman-catholics; one fourth, Greeks, Jews, and Anabapti&s;ts; and the other half, Lutherans and Calvini&s;ts. The latter, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, are far behind their brethren in other countries in knowledge and di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>From the circum&s;tance of the religion of the country being formerly catholic, it is natural to expect that
<PB N="295" REF="339">
this religion &s;hould be the e&s;tabli&s;hed one of the &s;tate. With this no &s;en&s;ible man can be offended, notwith|&s;tanding the comparative diminution of its members to that of the reformed church; but, to take away the 300 churches from the Prote&s;tants, whil&s;t the Jews are in|dulged with building as many &s;ynagogues as they plea&s;e, is a very impolitic, and unchri&s;tian-like di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice in the liberty of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>By the re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition of the Je&s;uits, the prote&s;t|ants were not only deprived of the public u&s;e of churches, but their &s;chools were prohibited, &s;o that they were obli|ged to &s;end their youth to foreign &s;eminaries for education. Thus the Court of Vienna was influenced, till within a few months back, to encourage the idle and profligate Calmucks and Gyp&s;ies, rather than laborious and moral prote&s;tants. This mode may be termed, with a good deal of propriety, a de&s;truction of the national character, without improving the external circum&s;tances of the people.</P>
<P>It is now well known, and the example of the Engli&s;h fully proves it, that the only way out of barbari&s;m is through real religion. Judge then what it mu&s;t be to tread this road backwards, and to &s;ub&s;titute the &s;uper|&s;titious &s;pirit of monkery, for the mild, and indu&s;trious &s;pirit of prote&s;tanti&s;m. It is &s;trange to relate, that the late emperor, <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> II. gave &s;anction to this, and or|dered its execution, at the very time when he was en|deavouring
<PB N="296" REF="340">
to curb the power of the prie&s;ts, by di&s;|mantling their religious retirements, both convents and mona&s;teries, in various parts of the German empire, and forming &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments of education, as mu&s;t ulti|mately lead to prote&s;tant principles.</P>
<P>The Greek prie&s;ts, in Hungary arid Illyria, are exactly in the &s;ame &s;tate of ignorance and &s;emi-barbari&s;m as the Roman-catholic prie&s;ts were, in the reign of <HI>Charlemagne</HI> the Great, who laid the fir&s;t foundation for national im|provement, and fir&s;t began with an illumination of the prie&s;thood by knowledge and poli&s;h.</P>
<P>There are, at this time, &s;ays <HI>Ric&s;bec,</HI> many of the &s;pi|ritual pa&s;tors of the Greek church, who know not how to read tolerably; and to write, or calculate, is above their knowledge: for, if engaged in any manner where numbers are requi&s;ite, their fingers &s;erve as a tally.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e pious &s;hepherds of &s;ouls, continues the &s;ame author, a Macedonian by birth, who valued him|&s;elf much on his cla&s;&s;ical erudition of the Greek, and the reputation of his countryman, <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, took it into his head to in&s;truct a young gentleman in the hi&s;tory of the Trojan war. He &s;aid that a prince of the Trojans having run away with a French prince&s;s, the Greek, and Roman emperors, the king of France, and the &s;even Electors, went to Troy, and took the city, after an a&s;toni&s;hing long &s;iege, by means of a wooden
<PB N="297" REF="341">
hor&s;e, filled with armed men. Notwith&s;tanding their gro&s;s ignorance, yet the&s;e prie&s;ts are the idols of the &s;till more ignorant congregations. The catholic prie&s;ts who live at any di&s;tance from the large towns are little behind the Greeks in being illiterate and vulgar in manners. Their whole library con&s;i&s;ts of their breviary, and the only thing they &s;tudy is the Latin language.</P>
<P>The public &s;eminaries, or univer&s;ities for cultivating literature, are tho&s;e of Firnan, Buda, Raab and Ca&s;|cham. All the profe&s;&s;ors are Je&s;uits; &s;o that the Luthe|rans, Calvini&s;ts, and other Prote&s;tants are obliged to go to the German colleges to complete their academical &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Hungarians do not want parts, yet it is ob&s;erved that this country produces but few learned men. The only rea&s;on that can be a&s;&s;igned for this, is the poverty of the knowledge of the profe&s;&s;ors, who neither improve in the &s;ciences them&s;elves, nor ad|mit tho&s;e from other countries, who are adequate to the ta&s;k, to become public members.</P>
<P>The church, by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, is governed by two archbi&s;hops and nine bi&s;hops. The archbi&s;hop of Gran, is primate of all Hungary, and chief &s;ecretary and chan|cellor, <HI>Legatus natus</HI> of the papal &s;ee, and prince of the Holy Roman empire. He alone crowns the king, and is a perpetual count in right of his &s;piritual dignity. He
<PB N="298" REF="342">
can create peers, confer titles and orders of knighthood, &amp;c. Next to him is the archbi&s;hop of Kolacza, who has eight &s;uffragans. The bi&s;hops are of a double cha|racter and are temporal lords as well as &s;piritual ones.</P>
<P>The abbots are ten in number, and have voices in the e&s;tates of the kingdom, and are reckoned after the bi|&s;hops in precedency.</P>
<P>The &s;piritual courts appointed for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, are held in every dioce&s;e and chapter, but with a power of appealing to the archbi&s;hop, and afterwards to the pope's legate; and may at la&s;t be car|ried to the papal court at Rome.</P>
<P>The pure language of the Huns, re&s;embles that of the Hebrew, as it is wholly governed by points and accents. But <HI>Bu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing</HI> &s;ays that it is really a dialect of the ancient Scythia, without the lea&s;t affinity to any of the European tongues and of one unvaried dialect.</P>
<P>In writing, the Hungarians u&s;e the Roman characters; the Germans have their different dialects, according to their nations which are &s;ettled here. There are al&s;o dia|lects of the Sclavonian and Wallachian tongues u&s;ed here. The Latin is not only &s;poken by the literati and gentry, but al&s;o by the commonality; however the latter are not very correct, yet it may be &s;aid that the ancient Roman
<PB N="299" REF="343">
language is &s;till a living one in Hungary, though dead to all the world be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Were &s;y&s;tems of religion not &s;hackled with penalties by Roman-catholic princes, it is certain the &s;un&s;hine of &s;cience, would cha&s;e away the vapours of &s;uper&s;tition and gro&s;s ignorance, which carry &s;uch ab&s;urd, and fre|quently fanta&s;tic characters on the face of them, that more poli&s;hed nations with great rea&s;on laugh at. Can the minds of men be confined to any particular mode of thinking; or &s;hall their ideas be reducible to any pecu|liar form? Surely every moral agent who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of common under&s;tanding and impre&s;&s;ed by the laws of ci|vil &s;ociety will readily acquie&s;ce in the happy plan of univer&s;al toleration. Britain has been long famed for this excellent rule of faith, and leaves open her church doors for all who are willing to come in, and al&s;o to ac|commodate tho&s;e that go out of her pales; for certain it is, free privilege gives life to the name of a chri&s;tian, and a body to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of this our favored land, and all its dependencies.</P>
<P>It appears from the writings of the be&s;t modern au|thors, that this crown has been &s;ometimes hereditary, and at others elective. That &s;ometimes their princes have acted arbitrarily, and at others been limited and re&s;trained by the &s;tates. That there have been innu|merable &s;truggles between the crown and the &s;tates. The former for exerci&s;e of prerogative and the latter for li|miting
<PB N="300" REF="344">
the &s;overeign power. In hi&s;tory it is &s;urprizing to find &s;o many kings depo&s;ed or murdered either by factious &s;ubjects or ambitious rivals. And as their kings could not by their con&s;titution legally oppre&s;s their &s;ub|jects and invade their properties, therefore regicide was le&s;s pardonable here than in any other nation in chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>If the people indeed are ve&s;ted with the &s;upreme pow|er, and the kings are but their officers and accountable to them, they will have &s;ome pretence for re&s;i&s;ting and dethroning them, when they act contrary to the good of the community: and may without imputation of pari|cide do ju&s;tice upon them, in the language of our regi|cides, with Oliver Cromwell at their head, <Q>that the re&s;t of the kings of the earth may hear and fear, and do no more, &s;o wickedly.</Q> But as our republicans go upon that mi&s;take, that kings can have no legal au|thority, but what is conferred on them by the ma|jority of the people, their princes are always ac|countable to the majority of the people. And &s;ince there is &s;carce any in&s;tance in the world that the majority of the people (the multitude) were ever con&s;ulted in the election of a monarch or &s;upreme magi&s;trate, their fan|cied power over their monarchs mu&s;t be a mere chimera.</P>
<P>The elegant pamphlet lately publi&s;hed by the Right Hon. <HI>Edmund Burke,</HI> M. P. relative to the divine right of kings, proclaims a new &s;ort of doctrine as far as it
<PB N="301" REF="345">
touches on the authority and unlimited controul of potentates: which gives a new &s;pecies of rea&s;oning far beyond any thing we have had the peru&s;al of for many years, and in &s;everal particulars may be &s;aid to be truly original. This author, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the political cri&s;is of France, endeavours to overturn the new modelled con&s;titution of that country, merely becau&s;e the govern|ment of it has a&s;&s;igned the king but a nominal &s;ituation in&s;tead of the unbounded field of prerogative he for|merly partook of.</P>
<P>This curious addre&s;s would be more applicable when we come to &s;peak of France; but a &s;hort ab&s;tract of its leading features, we pre&s;ume, will here be con&s;onant to the &s;ubject.&mdash;<Q>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;pecious pretences of maintaining the people's rights and privileges by attempts upon the throne, as if they had, <HI>jure divino,</HI> an unalienable, and a feazible right to call their &s;overeign to account; depo&s;e, and condemn him as their wi&s;doms conceive to be the criterion to promote the public good: for, &s;hould it be admitted that they have &s;uch an authority, &s;urely it is equally perceptible to an enlightened mind how inadequate the major part of mankind are to a di&s;cri|mination of the upright acts of their prince? Ambi|tion is at the botton of the&s;e combinations, and only flatters the public with the notion of their unbounded right to make and un-make kings: till, by their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, the new modellers have got the reigns of
<PB N="302" REF="346">
government; and then the&s;e noble patriots commonly laugh at the many-headed bea&s;t that has advanced them, leaving the people to labour under greater dif|ficulties than they did before; or, perhaps, loading them with in&s;upportable taxes to maintain their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, pretending, that their e&s;tabli&s;hment and the people's happine&s;s are in&s;eparable.</Q> Here we leave the digre&s;&s;ion; and, in the genuine &s;pirit of the author's rea&s;oning, cannot but concur; yet at the &s;ame time we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, much may be &s;aid on both &s;ides the que&s;tion, as circum&s;tances may tend to vary right and wrong very materially.</P>
<P>But on all hands it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that no nation has ever &s;uffered more in the&s;e &s;truggles between the crown and the &s;tates than the Hungarians; for, while one &s;ide called in the emperor, the other called in the grand &s;ignor, to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and made the coun|try a &s;cene of wars and blood-&s;hed for upwards of 200 years together; till, in the end, the German emperor has become ma&s;ter of the country, and has driven the Turks entirely out of Hungary, and reduced it to the form of a province. They have contended with their princes about their rights and privileges, till the Impe|rial eagle has decided the controver&s;y by devouring both, and left them only the &s;hadow of their ancient con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="347">The ceremony of the coronation of the kings of Hun|gary is attended with rather curious formulae.&mdash;The ge|neral a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates appoint a place, u&s;ually Pre&s;burg, or Buda. Here the bi&s;hops, the nobility, and the repre&s;entatives of the &s;everal countries and cities unanimou&s;ly approve of the new monarch, who is al|ways the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding the nece&s;|&s;ary form of election previous to his being crowned. Then the palatinate (who&s;e office we &s;hall pre&s;ently de|&s;cribe) demands, with a loud voice, three times, whe|ther the a&s;&s;embly approves of the new elected king? And, having expre&s;&s;ed their con&s;ent by loud acclama|tions, he delivers a naked &s;word into the king's hand, which the &s;overeign brandi&s;hes E. W. N. and S. After which he is attended by the &s;tates to the great Cathedral church, where, the arch-bi&s;hop of Gran, holding the regal robes in his hand, again demands of the people, whether they are &s;atisfied with the king elect, and are willing to become his &s;ubjects? And, on receiving an an&s;wer in the affirmative, he proceeds to perform the u&s;ual rites ob&s;erved at the coronation of their kings; after which, the prelates and nobility carry the arms and reliques of king <HI>Stephen</HI> I. before the new king, in a &s;plendid proce&s;&s;ion, to the palace.</P>
<P>The crown of <HI>Stephen</HI> I. is &s;till pre&s;erved at Pre&s;burg with great veneration, if not &s;uper&s;tition; and no prince is allowed to be duly crowned with another crown. The Roman-catholics do not he&s;itate to declare openly that
<PB N="304" REF="348">
the fate of the nation depends on the careful pre&s;ervation of it; and in all their calamities took great care to pre|&s;erve it in a place of &s;afety. The legend of this crown runs thus. When <HI>Stephen</HI> I. began to propagate the chri&s;tian religion in his dominions, he &s;ent a tru&s;ty per|&s;on to pope <HI>Benedict</HI> VII. de&s;iring his holine&s;s to confirm him in his kingdom, and &s;end him a crown, and other regal ornaments. <HI>My&s;cha,</HI> duke of Poland, having &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to Rome at this time, on the &s;ame account, and a crown being provided for him: but, an angel appearing to the pope, the night before it was to be &s;ent away, de&s;ired, that the crown de&s;igned for the Pole, &s;hould be &s;ent to <HI>Stephen,</HI> which was done accordingly. The catholic Hungarians believe this tradition equally with any article of their faith, and give this antique relique almo&s;t divine adoration.</P>
<P>The per&s;on of greate&s;t authority, next to the king, is the palatine, or guardian of the kingdom, and is elected by the &s;tates. This officer has the fir&s;t voice in the election of a king, and is always the guardian to the in|fant princes of the blood, and has authority to a&s;&s;emble the &s;tates during an inter-regnum, and admini&s;ter ju&s;tice in every particular, the &s;ame as the monarch him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The fate of the new edition of the bible in the Hun|garian language, is a recent proof of the bigotry of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of this country. In the confu&s;ions of the late wars, and by other calamities, bibles were
<PB N="305" REF="349">
grown &s;o &s;carce, that many communities had not above one, or two at mo&s;t. Upon this, &s;everal of the mo&s;t opulent of the &s;ocieties of Prote&s;tants apprehending that this &s;carcity of the word of God would nece&s;&s;arily be at|tended with the total abolition of true chri&s;tianity, ge|nerou&s;ly undertook to publi&s;h a new edition.</P>
<P>The work was printed in Holland; new types were ca&s;t; and per&s;ons well qualified were &s;ent to &s;uper-intend the pre&s;s. Every thing went on pro&s;perou&s;ly, &s;o that the impre&s;&s;ion was happily fini&s;hed both with accuracy and beauty: and the only difficulty remaining was, how to convey the copies to Hungary before the Roman-catholics &s;hould by fal&s;e repre&s;entations influence the Emperor to prohibit their importation.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual application was made to court for a royal licence, which was readily granted, but the Je&s;uits party found means to ingratiate them&s;elves with &s;ome of the leading men of the Romi&s;h religion, &s;o that the books were not permitted to come within the territories of the kingdom, under a wicked &s;ugge&s;tion that it was an er|roneous tran&s;lation. By this fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertion the bibles were only &s;uffered to reach the city of Dantzic, where many of them are to be found at the pre&s;ent period.</P>
<P>Since the demi&s;e of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> II. the archbi&s;hop of Gran hath &s;ummoned the clergy of Hungary in the Roman-catholic intere&s;t, and in convocation have deliberated
<PB N="306" REF="350">
on a requi&s;ition to the new king <HI>Leopold,</HI> the pre&s;ent Emperor of Germany, in which they conclu&s;ively ad|dre&s;&s;ed the throne very uncharitably, making it an act which &s;hould carry the penalty of death with it, as well as forfeiture of temporalities to any one who &s;hould em|brace the prote&s;tant religion. And again endeavored to revive the frend-like &s;pirit of per&s;ecution with all its con|comitant train of cruelties; but the mildne&s;s of the mo|narch &s;temmed the torrent of the&s;e zealots, and in a &s;tile becoming the dignity of a <HI>Leopold;</HI> his Imperial ma|je&s;ty tempered the &s;harpne&s;s of the religious votaries.</P>
<P>What a mi&s;taken notion is it in the brea&s;t of man, to conceive that the God of all purity, peace, and mercy, &s;hould be honoured by the cruel butcheries of his crea|tures, merely becau&s;e their notions of outward forms, or inward &s;y&s;tems, were not exactly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of &s;ome peculiar mode of their king! Is the outward trappings of woe a proof of the internal &s;orrow? Or is the &s;hape and air of the man, a token of his truth or fal&s;e|hood? Certainly none of the&s;e things carry evidence &s;uf|ficient to take it for granted, that truths are appendages that may be taken conclu&s;ively, as matters of fact. For the contrary frequently proves the in&s;ufficiency of all human &s;y&s;tems to arrange the works of providence, and much le&s;s to attempt a regulation of the &s;tate of &s;pi|ritual communion with the Creator.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="351">In the ear of a moderate Prote&s;tant, how unharmonious mu&s;t it grate, when he is told that the holy office of the inqui&s;ition condemns not only the unhappy victims of their cruelty and malice to the flames, but al&s;o a&s;&s;igns them over to a particular &s;pecies of torment, in a world of mi&s;erable &s;pirits.</P>
<P>If this mode of &s;erving the Deity can be reconciled to the gentle a&s;pect of the go&s;pel, where &s;aith mu&s;t accom|pany good works, and charity be cloathed with mercy, and an univer&s;al benevolence, not only to do good to our friends, but al&s;o to our enemies, and even to pray for their happine&s;s both here, and hereafter; what is the office of Catholic love?</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of Government, Army E&s;tabli&s;hment, and Laws.</HEAD>
<P>THE king of Hungary is &s;tiled Catholic, to which is added the title of Apo&s;tolic, on account of the zeal, which <HI>Stephen</HI> I. &s;hewed in the conver&s;ion of the king. The regalia, namely the golden crown, made in the eleventh century, the &s;ceptre, &s;word, mantle, and &s;hoes; with the &s;ilver cro&s;s, the mark of the Apo&s;tolic function are kept in the ca&s;tle of Pre&s;burg, and u&s;ed al|ways at the coronation of all the kings &s;ince the above period.</P>
<P>The &s;tates are divided into four cla&s;&s;es, which, in the laws of the land, are called collectively, The People. The fir&s;t, are the prelates, who have the direction of religious matters, and have precedence of all others, except the governor of the kingdom. The &s;econd cla&s;s is called the great barons of the kingdom, and officers of the court, according to their precedency, and the counts and inferior barons. The third are &s;tiled gen|try; and the fourth are citizens and burge&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The king, and the&s;e &s;tates, through the channels of the diet, royal councils, exchequer and &s;enates of towns, govern the kingdom. The diet is &s;ummoned every three years, for the di&s;patch of public bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="353">Ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered in civil affairs, in the king's name, after the manner pre&s;cribed by the laws and cu&s;|toms of the kingdom. In the royal free cities, the fir&s;t hearing is before the judge of the town; and the &s;econd before the council, from which they may appeal to the trea&s;urer.</P>
<P>The mine-towns have a court peculiar to them&s;elves, and all di&s;putes between the nobility and their va&s;&s;als may be removed, by writ of error, to the grand court of the archbi&s;hop of Gran.</P>
<P>In public affairs, we may reduce their con&s;titution and law to &s;imilar &s;ituations in our own government. Their diet, like our parliament, is a &s;ort of check on the regal power of the prince. The Hungary office, which is e&s;tabli&s;hed at Vienna, re&s;embles our chancery. The &s;tadholder's council an&s;wers pretty much to a Briti&s;h privy council. The Ga&s;pan chafts are like our ju&s;tices of the peace.</P>
<P>In criminal matters, the judge of the town is, with his council, fully authorized to exerci&s;e his power, and life and death are in his hands; but few ca&s;es, except tho&s;e of murder, witch-craft, or here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, are puni&s;hed with death; the re&s;t of our catalogue the Hungarians con&s;ider a temporary puni&s;hment to be adequate to the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime. And the&s;e exactions are gene|rally confined to money, or articles of u&s;e and value.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="354">The military &s;trength of this kingdom is a&s;certained to be 50,000 Hungarians, but the Emperor &s;eldom draws out more than 10,000; and the&s;e generally are light-hor&s;e, and are well known to modern times by the name of Hu&s;&s;ars. They are not near &s;o large as the German hor&s;e, and therefore &s;tand on their tip-toes in the &s;tirrups when they &s;trike.</P>
<P>Their expedition and alertne&s;s have been found &s;o &s;er|viceable in war, that the greate&s;t powers in Europe have troops that go by the &s;ame name. Their foot are called heydukes, and wear feathers in their caps accord|ing to the number of enemies they pretend to have killed. Both hor&s;e and foot are very good at ravaging and plundering an enemy's country, but not equal to regular troops in a pitched battle: however, they make together an excellent national militia.</P>
<P>It is remarkable enough, that, whil&s;t in imitation of the Hungarian &s;oldiers, the Hu&s;&s;ar has become an e&s;&s;ential part of the Pru&s;&s;ian army, and has al&s;o been received into the French regular troops, the true ori|ginal is lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in his own country. Not one of the 14 or 15 regiments of Hu&s;&s;ars, in the Emperor's &s;ervice, is made up entirely of Hungarians. Experienced officers have, it &s;eems, thought &s;uch regiments could no longer be of any &s;ervice; it may be &s;o, but it is certain that the Hungarians have lo&s;t their &s;pirit by their di&s;cipline: for, like other wild men, they dete&s;t the artificial arms,
<PB N="311" REF="355">
again&s;t which their &s;trength and courage are of no avail; and, if ever they &s;how them&s;elves in their native fierce|ne&s;s, it is only when the firing is over, and they come to clo&s;e engagement: then each oppo&s;es him&s;elf to the armed enemy. Here, indeed, the hero &s;ometimes &s;tarts out again.</P>
<P>A whole army of the&s;e men drawn up in battle array, unpowdered from the general to the common &s;oldier; half their faces covered with long whi&s;kers; a &s;ort of round beaver upon their heads in&s;tead of hats; without ruffles or frills to their &s;hirts: all clad in rough &s;kins; mon&s;trous crooked &s;abres ready drawn and uplifted; their eyes darting fla&s;hes of rage &s;harper than the beams of the naked &s;abre, would be &s;ufficient to di&s;may the hardie&s;t troops, and terrify even veterans. But now the poli&s;hed face of war, puts on a more elegant appearance, and the rough terrors of the warrior are allayed by the be|coming habit of fa&s;hion; the military man knows his &s;ea&s;on of changes to the mode of times, as well as the fop of the day.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h plan is of all others the mo&s;t &s;ound and well adapted to national policy; their principles is to keep up the &s;pirit of the troops, from an idea that the intere&s;ts of government are the &s;ame as tho&s;e of the people, and that they have nothing to fear from a muti|ny. Upon this ground hone&s;t John Bull reduces his
<PB N="312" REF="356">
people to a common &s;tandard, namely, to defend liberty and property generally, as well as particularly.</P>
<P>There cannot be a doubt but in obedient and &s;trong &s;ubordination, the principal &s;trength of an army con|&s;i&s;ts; but it is impo&s;&s;ible to unite them with an idea of feeling for &s;elf, in the &s;ubaltern and underling. Can &s;entiments of per&s;onal honour, bravery, and patrioti&s;m be prejudicial to an army? Surely every &s;en&s;ible man will an&s;wer in the negative. And were it only to meliorate the condition of the poor &s;oldier; were it only to make his hard fate le&s;s &s;evere, it &s;hould be the policy of prin|ces to promote tho&s;e feelings which can &s;weeten &s;o many bitter hours, and alone enable them to meet death.</P>
<P>The Hungarians in general are extremely proper for a military life; they want nothing to be perfect &s;oldiers, but a kind of education which good government might give them. The Croats particularly have all the requi|&s;ites for &s;ervice. Their u&s;ual height is &s;ix feet; they are boney, fle&s;hy, quick and lively, and can bear the extremes of cold and hunger. In a word, there are no better made men in Europe, notwith&s;tanding which they are the mo&s;t mi&s;erable part of the Imperial army; a &s;ure &s;ign that government either neglects them, or does not know how to di&s;cipline them properly.</P>
<P>Sometimes it has been propo&s;ed to incorporate them with other corps, but this would be only to take away
<PB N="313" REF="357">
their natural advantages, and furni&s;h them with arti|ficial ones in their &s;tead. Such a change would put an end to their u&s;ual way of life, to which they are in|debted for their hardine&s;s. They commonly dwell &s;ix or &s;even under the &s;ame roof. As their frugality enables them to bring up many children, they marry early, in the vigour of their youth, and their children are the produce of their unimpaired manhood.</P>
<P>Their juices are &s;till uncorrupt, and the de&s;tructive di&s;tempers which poi&s;on the &s;ources of life, are not yet introduced among&s;t them. The patriarchical go|vernment &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts here, and the grandfather who has grown old amid&s;t his children and grand-children, &s;till retains an authority over them. As by this means their manners are pre&s;erved, uncorrupted, and un|contaminated with any &s;pecies of vice; nothing more is requi&s;ite than to humanize their prie&s;ts; this would render them good &s;ubjects to the &s;tate without com|merce, manufactures, or arts, which the emperor <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> II. lately endeavored to introduce among&s;t them, and which mu&s;t be allowed was not to their advan|tage.</P>
<P>An education more &s;uitable to the nature of their country, and their peculiar con&s;titution would by de|grees deprive them of their native ferocity; and they would become the more tractable, in proportion as they acquired better notions of religion and agriculture.
<PB N="314" REF="358">
Their uncouth manners, the natural con&s;equence of their barbarity, is the true rea&s;on why they are &s;o aver&s;e to di&s;cipline; and the only way of getting the better of this, and making them like the other &s;ubjects of the hou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Au&s;tria, fit for military &s;ervice, is do|me&s;tic education: this alone can bring them out of their barbarity, without depriving them of their other advantages.</P>
<P>Were the Hungarians to be removed from their own prejudices in a military capacity, the cure might probably be wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e, to effect which, no alternative be&s;ide that of incorporating them with other troops remains. Suppo&s;ing this was to be ef|fected, and to make &s;laves of them in the be&s;t years of their lives and when the voice of nature crieth mo&s;t aloud, what would be the con&s;equence? Accu&s;tomed to all their vices, I mean tho&s;e of a &s;tanding army, they would con&s;ume the vigour of their lives in per|nicious indulgencies; they would return to their na|tive country corrupted with a variety of wants they did not know before.</P>
<P>Having acquired a ta&s;te for plea&s;es of forbidden love, they would either not marry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all, or marry later than their ance&s;tors; all the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> dome&s;tic ordi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ances would be aboli&s;hed, nor w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ld their wives be any longer di&s;tingui&s;hed for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ha&s;tity. Their children would imitate them i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their vices; and the con&s;e|quence
<PB N="315" REF="359">
of all would be, that in the &s;econd generation, one would be hardly able to di&s;tingui&s;h them; and in the third, or at mo&s;t the fourth, not know them at all from the other &s;ubjects of the empire; &s;o totally would they have lo&s;t the &s;ize, &s;trength, frugality and fine form which now &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;h them.</P>
<P>To attempt any change that may be propo&s;ed would be taking a dangerous leap from barbarous to civil life, and all that could be expected from it, would be a broken limb, if not a broken neck.</P>
<P>Thus to attempt pruning or lopping off the exu|berant branches which &s;pring from the &s;tock of na|ture, would reduce the &s;ubject to le&s;s than half its pri&s;tine vigour, &s;erving no other purpo&s;e than that of degenerating the noble acqui&s;ition of inbred virtues of hereditary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to the frailties of an artificial form, to &s;erve no good purpo&s;e whatever, nor indulge any other pa&s;&s;ion than that of caprice: and then view the reduction of the noble &s;tructure in its ruins, with|out being ever able to erect the edifice, &s;o as to an&s;wer the end which the native Hungarian, in his pre&s;ent uncultivated &s;tate, happily fulfils in the mo&s;t unlimited &s;en&s;e of the word.</P>
<P>This nation was formerly remarkable for its coin|age, as the cabinets of the curious in all countries clearly &s;hew. Even medals of the exacte&s;t arrange|ment

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> BELGRADE.</HEAD>
<P>BELGRADE, Alba-Graecorum, or Greek Wei&s;|&s;enburg, having been recently the &s;eat of war, in the Turki&s;h dominions, and before who&s;e walls &s;o many Imperiali&s;ts have fallen, it mu&s;t be a gratifi|cation to the reader, altho' an innovation in the regu|larity of our plan, to introduce it here; &s;o <HI>&s;ans cere|monie,</HI> we &s;hall give a minute de&s;cription of this cele|brated fortre&s;s, which at this period is a topic of con|ver&s;ation in every polite circle.</P>
<P>The city and important fortre&s;s of Belgrade, is &s;itu|ate at the conflux of the rivers Save and Danube, and con&s;i&s;ts of three parts, of which one is the citadel, erected on an eminence in the middle of the city.</P>
<P>It is the capital of the province of Servia, or Ra&s;cia, and, previous to the late &s;iege, it was con&s;idered as a &s;trong, populous trading city. It was formerly ac|counted the barrier and key of Hungary, to which it was at fir&s;t annexed by the German emperor in 1440, but be&s;ieged and taken by the Turks in 1521, and till 1688, it remained in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, when the Huns again became ma&s;ters of it; and in 1739, it
<PB N="318" REF="363">
was ceded to the Turks, who have &s;ince been the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it, till taken by the Imperiali&s;ts in the late war.</P>
<P>This city lies in latitude 45 deg. 10 min. N. and longitude 21 deg. 2 min. E. The many vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune which it has experienced, induces us to give a brief account of &s;ome of them. <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent laid &s;iege to it in 1521, as before ob&s;erv|ed, and it was retaken by the Imperiali&s;ts in 1686, un|der the conduct of the duke of Bavaria. The Turks laid &s;iege again to it in the year 1688, and the maga|zine of the town being blown up by one of the ene|my's bombs, with part of the walls, the Turks then took it by &s;torm, and put all the garri&s;on to the &s;word, con&s;i&s;ting of upwards of 6000 men, except the governor and about 300 &s;oldiers, who e&s;caped out of one of the gates, while the enemy was bu&s;y in plundering the town.</P>
<P>About the beginning of June 1717, the Imperial|i&s;ts under the command of Prince Eugene of Savoy, inve&s;ted Belgrade again, and the place being of the la&s;t importance to the Turks, the grand vizir was commanded to relieve it at all hazards, which he at|tempted to do in Augu&s;t following. This brought on a general engagement, wherein the Imperial troops obtained a complete victory.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="364">It is remarked by the able&s;t hi&s;torians that there never were &s;o many Ottomans in the field at one time, as at this memorable battle. The fire was well &s;u&s;|tained on the part of the Turks; and from the num|ber of the killed and wounded, it &s;tands on record to be the mo&s;t bloody of any battle that ever was fought between infidels and chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The Turks lo&s;t about 150 pieces of cannon, 50 mortars, and their whole camp: and what is worthy of remark, the Imperiali&s;ts did not enter the enemy's camp to plunder till the general gave permi&s;&s;ion, nor till the whole army was rallied and put in order.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of this battle was attended with the &s;ur|render of Belgrade, which capitulated two days after|wards. It was computed on a moderate calculation, that there were not le&s;s than 80,000 Mahometans within the walls of Belgrade, among&s;t which near 30,000 were &s;oldiers: and by an exact li&s;t of the artillery taken in the town and in the battle, that it con&s;i&s;ted of 480 pieces of bra&s;s cannon, 250 of iron, and 109 bra&s;s mortars. From all of which, the reader may readily conceive what a large and important city this mu&s;t at that time have been.</P>
<P>We need not give any further hi&s;tory of the &s;ieges of this place, having already ob&s;erved that it fell to the Turks in 1739. The Hungarians were then
<PB N="320" REF="365">
obliged to evacuate it, though not before they had demoli&s;hed its outworks, leaving nothing &s;tanding but its old walls, and &s;ome fortifications in&s;eparable from them. The two ca&s;tles hereafter de&s;cribed, were built &s;ince that period.</P>
<P>The horrors of a &s;iege are ea&s;ier conceived than de|&s;cribed. The dire nece&s;&s;ities of war, obliges the con|tending parties to the exerci&s;e of their inventive facul|ties to form &s;chemes of de&s;truction by all po&s;&s;ible modes of artifice, &s;o as to weaken the oppo&s;ing power. Every hour is applied to havock, deva&s;tation and car|nage. Death &s;talks abroad in all &s;hapes. The pin|ing citizen though in no wi&s;e bu&s;ied in the &s;cenes of war, but active to remove his merchandize to &s;ubter|raneous &s;tores; on his return perhaps beholds his dwel|ling blazing fiercely by the ho&s;tile heated ball that falls within its attic &s;tory. His family, all in tears, la|ment not for the conflagrating &s;cene, but in &s;obbing accents grieve for the untimely fate of the haple&s;s mo|ther of the mourning children. Now mark the dan|gers that await the whole; a deadly &s;hot bereaves the group of life of hope and care, and mingles them with the flying du&s;t or filthy earth unpitied and without no|tice of their fate! Thus war levels all di&s;tinctions, in age, &s;ex, and rank. All are liable to the call of fate.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="366">By the elegant per&s;pective view of the city which we have with great pains procured, the reader may perceive that the Save, which is a large river, runs on the we&s;t &s;ide of the city, and the great river the Da|nube on the north &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Danube is very broad here, and its current &s;o rapid that it &s;eems to cut off that of the Save; ju&s;t as the Rhone does that of the Seine, near Lyons, in France.&mdash;The water of the Danube &s;eems to be yel|low and troubled, and that of the Save greeni&s;h and clear. At the mouth of the Save is an i&s;le made there of the &s;ettling of the &s;ands of both &s;treams, and is now covered over with a kind of a wood.</P>
<P>On the entrance into the town is the water ca&s;tle, which is a &s;trong piece of fortification, well con|&s;tructed for defence; and on a further entrance is the upper ca&s;tle, which is flanked with divers towns, and forms an irregular fortification of great &s;trength al&s;o.</P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t trading &s;treets are covered with a &s;ort of pent-hou&s;es, to keep off the &s;un and rain. The &s;hops are no bigger than taylors' &s;hopboards, and very low, the &s;hop-keepers &s;itting in them as our taylors do, cro&s;s-legged, which have a &s;ingular appearance to an inhabitant of any of the Chri&s;tian &s;tates of this quarter of the globe.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="367">The chapmen or buyers never enter into the&s;e little &s;hops or &s;talls, but view the goods at the door, and make their la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s under the cover of the projecting pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s. But be&s;ides the&s;e, there are two large beza&s;tans, or places where the be&s;t commodities are &s;old; they are built in the form of a cro&s;s, like the old cathedrals, with walks within like the Royal Ex|change at London.</P>
<P>They have two exchanges for merchandize, which are &s;olely occupied by whole&s;ale venders; the&s;e build|ings are elegantly erected on two rows of pilars, the one over the other.</P>
<P>The Turks have built &s;ince their la&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, a very &s;tately caravan&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or the entertain|ment of poor travellers of the Mu&s;&s;elmen; it has a noble fountain, and a &s;pacious court, at the top of which is a grand mo&s;que. To this is annexed, a kind of a college for &s;tudents in the Mahometan di|vinity. The&s;e &s;tudents, as well as the heads of the &s;eminary, wear green gowns and &s;quare caps, differing little in the forms of dre&s;s from our univer&s;ities of Oxford and Cambridge.</P>
<P>The &s;epulchres for the dead are all very properly without the town, a practice highly commendable in all large cities, as the contaminated air, which re|ceives its infection from the putrefaction of the dead,
<PB N="323" REF="368">
is, in its nature, very prejudicial to the living; for the &s;aline particles of the efiluviae are ob&s;erved by every one who walks out, either at an early hour in the morning, or in the cool approach of night.</P>
<P>But, it is to be ob&s;erved, that the trading people and merchants are confined very nearly to the &s;ect of Ar|menians, which are very numerous, and have the privilege of a large church for public wor&s;hip here. Indeed their dealings are far more impartial and fair than either the Greeks or Jews.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Belgrade makes it a place of ex|ten&s;ive trade, being &s;o well furni&s;hed with water con|veyances. For the navigable river Tey&s;e falls into the Danube, near the town; and the Drave and the Meri&s;h are al&s;o di&s;embogued into the Danube, a little below the fortre&s;s. All which advantages contri|bute not a little to the traffic of this place. Added to which, the adjacent country thro' which the&s;e rivers pa&s;s, particularly the Danube in its fall towards the Euxine &s;ea, is &s;o fruitful and well &s;upplied with every production of nature, that the&s;e advantages are &s;ufficient to make it one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing cities in Europe, was it in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an indu&s;|trious nation as the Engli&s;h or Dutch: but whil&s;t it remains in the hands of the Turks, it will never exceed its pre&s;ent &s;tate, of being far below its meridian.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="369">This city was formerly the main bulwark of Hun|gary, which has &s;everal times &s;temmed the torrent of the Turki&s;h victories, even Mahomet the Great, and all his numerous forces.</P>
<P>It is a remarkable Epocha, in 1521, when Maho|met appeared upon the Danube near this city with 200 gallies, and other armed ve&s;&s;els, which were &s;o &s;martly engaged by the Chri&s;tian &s;leet, that be&s;ides what was taken, the Turks were forced to &s;et their own ve&s;&s;els on fire, to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Though the di&s;tance from Belgrade to Vienna is about 400 miles, yet it is one continued plain, without a hill or fore&s;t, &s;o that it &s;eems to be a po&s;t de&s;igned by nature, of the utmo&s;t importance to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. It is about the &s;ame di&s;tance from Con&s;tan|tinople, but by no means &s;o ea&s;ily approached to from thence, as from Vienna. Indeed the Germanic court, &s;hould exert it&s;elf to retain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this key of the empire. For by it the trade of Hungary, Bo|hemia, and Germany, with all their dependancies might be con&s;iderably increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>This great fortre&s;s was with the lo&s;s of &s;everal thou|&s;ands of the flower of the Au&s;trian troops be&s;ieged for nearly two years by the late emperor, <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> II, and at length taken; but not before a lo&s;s of at lea&s;t 50,000
<PB N="325" REF="370">
men, by pe&s;tilence and extreme hard&s;hips, owing to the &s;everity of the different &s;ea&s;ons, in which the Im|periali&s;ts were before the walls: it may therefore with confidence be &s;aid that this ancient city co&s;t the vic|tors an effu&s;ion of blood; for though the Turks, who were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, made a vigorous re|&s;i&s;tance, yet the troops that fell by the fortune of war, in actual &s;ervice were few, when compared with tho&s;e that fell victims to the &s;ickne&s;s that raged in the camp; for the fatigues which <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> II. &s;uffered, were &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that the colds he contracted in the raining &s;ea&s;on, and the night air, were the cau&s;es of his &s;evere illne&s;s, which at la&s;t terminated in a painful death.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not animadvert on the conduct of the decea&s;ed emperor, further than to &s;ay, that he acted his part before this town with extreme heat, and at one time, great duplicity, by which means the poor inhabitants of the Greek and Armenian churches, were cut to pieces by the enraged Turks, as they fal&s;ely &s;uppo&s;ed, tho&s;e Chri&s;tian citizens had a de&s;ign to betray them into the hands of the Au&s;|rians.</P>
<P>This ma&s;&s;acre will ca&s;t a gloom over the memory of a potentate, who under pretence of a flag of truce, could be &s;o mean as to endeavor to deceive the gover|nor,
<PB N="326" REF="371">
and take the place by &s;urprize; but in this point he was him&s;elf deceived, and the Chri&s;tians butchered through his treachery.</P>
<P>By the late treaty with the Turks, the Au&s;trians have con&s;ented to abandon this garri&s;on, but not before the walls are era&s;ed, and the fortifications utterly de|&s;troyed: &s;o that it will in future, in all probabi|lity, be reckoned a frontier city of the Turks, and a mart for European and A&s;iatic goods. But, be this as it may, it will always be &s;ubject to the in|roads of the Imperial &s;ubjects, in ca&s;e of a war with the Porte.</P>
<P>Indeed the only advantages which the Turks reap from this place, is to keep the Hungarians and Bohe|mians from making incur&s;ions into the Turki&s;h do|minions, and protecting their trade on the Danube: as almo&s;t the whole of the merchants, as was before ob&s;erved, of Belgrade, have always been Chri&s;tians and Jews, therefore the Mahometans could not be &s;aid to be the principal gainers by the trade of this great city.</P>
<P>Before we di&s;mi&s;s this article, we cannot help ob|&s;erving, that were the Germans or Hungarians, a maritime people, this &s;ituation would be highly be|neficial to them; but as they are too much like the Turks in point of indolence, the city of Belgrade will
<PB N="327" REF="372" MS="y">
derive but little benefit from the ma&s;ters of it, whe|ther Turks or Germans.</P>
