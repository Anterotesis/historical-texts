<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have often thought that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;peaks to you, as <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s daughter did to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s mother, take this child, and nur&s;e it for me. Con|&s;ider what a precious jewel is committed to your charge, what an advantage you have to &s;hew your love to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to &s;tock the next generation with noble plants, and what a joyful Account you may make, if you be faithful: Remember, &s;ouls, Chri&s;t and grace cannot be overvalued. I confe&s;s you have &s;ome di&s;advantages, but let that only excite your diligence; the &s;alvation of &s;ouls, the com|mendation of your ma&s;ter, the greatne&s;s of your reward and everla&s;ting glory, will pay for all. Re|member the devil is at work hard, wicked ones are indu&s;trious, and a corrupt nature is a rugged, knot|ty piece to hew: But be not di&s;couraged: I am al|mo&s;t as much afraid of your lazine&s;s and unfaithful|ne&s;s, as any thing. Do but go to work in good ear|ne&s;t, and who knows but that rough &s;tone may prove a pillar in the temple of God? In the name of the
<PB REF="4">living God, as you will an&s;wer it &s;hortly at his bar, I command you to be faithful in in&s;tructing and catechizing your young ones; if you think I am too peremptory, I pray read the command from my ma&s;ter him&s;elf, <HI>Deut.</HI> vi. 7. Is not the duty clear? and dare you neglect &s;o direct a com|mand! Are the &s;ouls of your children of no value? Are you willing that they &s;hould be brands of hell? Are you indifferent whether they be damned or &s;aved? Shall the devil run away with them without controul? Will not you u&s;e your utmo&s;t endeavour to deliver them from the wrath to come? You &s;ee that they are not &s;ubjects uncapable of the grace of God; whatever you think of them, Chri&s;t doth not &s;light them; they are not too little to die, they are not too little to go to hell, they are not too little to &s;erve their great ma&s;ter, too little to go to heaven; <HI>For of &s;uch is the kingdom of God;</HI> and will not a po&s;&s;ibility of their conver&s;ion and &s;alva|tion, put you upon the greate&s;t diligence to teach them? Or are Chri&s;t and heaven, and &s;alvation, &s;mall things with you? if they be, then indeed I have done with you: but if they be not, I be&s;eech you lay about you with all your might; the devil knows your time is going apace, it will &s;hortly be too late. O therefore what you do, do quickly, and do it I &s;ay, with all your might; O pray, pray, pray, and live holily before them, and take &s;ome time daily to &s;peak a little to your children, one by one, about their mi&s;erable condition by na|ture; I knew a child that was converted by this &s;entence, from a godly &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;s in the coun|try, <HI>Every mother's child of you are by nature child|dren of wrath.</HI> Put your children upon learning their catechi&s;m, and the &s;criptures, and getting to pray and weep by them&s;elves after <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> take
<PB REF="5">heed of their company; take heed of pardoning a lye; take heed of letting them mi&s;-&s;pend the &s;abbath; put them, I be&s;eech you, upon imita|tating the&s;e &s;weet children; let them read this book over an hundred times, and ob&s;erve how they are <HI>effected,</HI> and a&s;k them what they think of tho&s;e children, and whether they would not be &s;uch? and follow what you do with earne&s;t cries to God, and be in travel to &s;ee Chri&s;t formed in their &s;ouls. I have prayed for you, I have oft prayed for your children and I love them dearly; and I have pray|ed over the&s;e papers, that God would &s;trike in with them, and make them effectual to the good of their &s;ouls. Incourage your children to read this book, and lead them to improve it. What is pre&s;ented, is faithfully taken from experienced, &s;o|lid chri&s;tians, &s;ome of them no way related to the children, who them&s;elves were eye and ear witne&s;&s;es of God's works of wonder; or from my own knowledge, or from reve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end godly mini&s;ters, and from per&s;ons that are of un&s;potted reputation, for holine&s;s, integrity, and wi&s;dom; and &s;everal pa&s;&s;a|ges are taken <HI>verbatim</HI> in writing from their dying lips. I may add many other excellent examples, if I have any encouragement in this piece, which the author had done, in the <HI>Second Part.</HI> That the young generation may be far more excellent than this, is the prayer of one that dearly loves little children.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE, Containing DIRECTIONS TO CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>YOU may now hear (my dear lambs) what other good children have done, and remem|ber how they wept and prayed by them|&s;elves? how earne&s;tly they cried out for an intere&s;t in the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> may you now read how dutiful they were to their parents? how diligent at their books? how ready to learn the &s;cripture and their catechi&s;ms? Can you forget what que&s;tions they were wont to a&s;k? How much they feared a lye, how much they abhorred naughty company, how holy they live, how dearly they were loved, how joyfully they died?</P>
<P>But tell me, my dear children, and tell me truly, do you do as the&s;e children did? Did you ever &s;ee your mi&s;erable &s;tate by nature? Did you ever get by your&s;elf and weep for &s;in and pray for grace and pardon? Did you ever go to your father and mother, ma&s;ter, or mi&s;|tre&s;s, and beg of them to pity you, and pray for you, and to teach you what you &s;hall do to be &s;aved, what you &s;hall do to get Chri&s;t, heaven and glory? Do&s;t
<PB REF="7">thou love to be taught good things? Come tell me truly, my dear child, for I would fain do what I can po&s;&s;ibly to keep thee from falling into everla&s;t|ing fire. I would fain have thee one of the&s;e lit|tle ones, which Chri&s;t will take into his arms and ble&s;s. How do&s;t thou &s;pend thy time? It is in play and idlene&s;s, and with wicked children? Dare you take God's name in vain, or &s;wear, or tell a lye? Dare you do any thing which your parents forbid you, and neglect to do what they command you? Do you dare to run up and down upon the Lord's day? Or do you keep in to read your book, and to learn what your good parents command you? What do you &s;ay, child? Which of the&s;e two &s;orts are you of? Let me talk a little with you, and a&s;k you a few que&s;tions.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>1.</HI> Were not the&s;e children &s;weet children, which feared God, and were dutiful to their parents? Did not their fathers and mothers, and every body that fears God, love them and prai&s;e them? What do you think is become of them, now they are dead and gone? Why, they are gone to heaven, and are &s;inging hallelujahs with the angels: they &s;ee glori|ous things, and having nothing but joy and plea&s;ure, they &s;hall never &s;in any more, they &s;hall never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> beat any more, they &s;hall never be &s;ick, or in pain any more.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>2.</HI> And would you not have your fathers love, your mothers commendation, your ma&s;ters good word? Would you not have God and Chri&s;t love you? And would not you fain go to heaven when you die? And live with your godly parents in glory, and be happy for ever?</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>3.</HI> Whither, do you think, tho&s;e children go when they die, that will not do what they are bid, but play the truant, and lie, and &s;peak naughty words
<PB REF="8">and break the &s;abbath? Whither do &s;uch children go, do you think? why, I will tell you, they which lie, mu&s;t go to their father the devil into everla&s;ting burning; they which never pray, God will p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur out his wrath upon them; and when they beg and pray in hell fire, God will not forgive them, but there they mu&s;t lie for ever.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>4.</HI> And are you willing to go to hell to be burned with the devil and his angels? Would you be in the &s;ame condition as naughty children? O hell is a ter|rible place, that's wor&s;e a thou&s;and times than whip|ping, God's anger is wor&s;e than your father's anger; and are you willing to anger God? O child, this is mo&s;t certainly true, that all that be wicked and die &s;o, mu&s;t be turned into hell; and if any be once there, there is no coming out again.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>5.</HI> Would you not do any thing in the world rather than be thrown into hell fire? Would you not do any thing in the world to get Chri&s;t, grace and glory.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>6.</HI> Well now, what will you do? will you read this book a little, becau&s;e your good mother will make you do it, and becau&s;e it is a little new book, but as &s;oon as ever you have done, run away to play, and never think of it?</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>7.</HI> How art thou now affected, poor child, in the reading of this book? Have you &s;hed ever a tear &s;ince you began reading? Have you been by your&s;elf upon your knees; and begging, that God would make you like tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed children? Or are you, as you u&s;ed to be, as carele&s;s and fooli&s;h, and di&s;obedient, and wicked as ever?</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>8.</HI> Did you never hear of a little child that died? And if other children die, why may not you be &s;ick and die? And what will you do then, child, if you &s;hould have no grace in your heart, and be found like other naughty children?</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>9.</HI> How do you know but that you may be the next child that may die? And where are you then if you be not God's child?</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>10.</HI> Wilt thou tarry any longer, my dear child, before thou run into thy chamber, and beg of God to give thee Chri&s;t for thy &s;oul, that thou may&s;t not be undone for ever? Wilt thou get pre&s;ently into a corner to weep and pray? Methinks I &s;ee that pretty lamb begin to weep, and think of getting by him&s;elf, and will, as well as he can, cry unto the Lord, to make him one of tho&s;e little ones that go into the kingdom of heaven; methinks there &s;tands a &s;weet child, and there another, that are re&s;olved for Chri&s;t and for heaven: methinks that little boy looks as if he had a mind to learn good things: methinks I hear one &s;ay, well, I will never tell a lye more, I will never keep any naughty boys company more, they will teach me to &s;wear, and they will &s;peak naughty words, they do not love God? I'll learn my cate|chi&s;m, and get my mother to teach me to pray, and will go weep and cry to Chri&s;t, and will not be quiet till the Lord hath given me grace. O that's my brave child indeed?</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>11.</HI> But will you not quickly forget your promi&s;e? Are you re&s;olved, by the &s;trength of Chri&s;t, to be a good child? Are you indeed? Nay, but are you indeed? Con&s;ider, dear child, God calls you to remember your Creator in the days of your youth; and he takes it kindly when little ones come to him, and loves them dearly, and godly people, e&s;pecially parents, and ma&s;|ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, they have no greater joy than to &s;ee their children walk in the way of truth.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Now tell me, my pretty dear child, what will you do? Shall I make you a book? Shall I pray for you, and in|treat you? Shall your good mother weep over you? And will not you make us all glad, by your turning quick|ly
<PB REF="10">to the Lord? Shall Chri&s;t tell you that he will love you? And will not you love him? Will you &s;trive to be like tho&s;e children? I am per&s;uaded that God in|tends to do good to the &s;ouls of &s;ome little children by the&s;e papers, becau&s;e he hath laid it &s;o much upon my heart to pray for them, and over the&s;e papers, and through mercy I have already experienced, that &s;ome|thing of this nature hath not been in vain. I &s;hall give a word of directions, and &s;o leave you.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>1.</HI> Take heed of what you know is naught, as ly|ing; O that is a grievous fault indeed, and naughty words, and taking the Lord's name in vain, and play|ing upon the Lord's day, and keeping bad company, and playing with ungodly children: But if you go to &s;chool with &s;uch, tell them, that God will not love them, but thet the devil will have them, if they con|tinue to be &s;o naught.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>2.</HI> Do what your father and mother bids you chear|fully; and take heed of doing any thing that they for|bid you.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>3.</HI> Be diligent in reading the &s;cripture, and learn|ing your catechi&s;m; and what you do not under&s;tand, be &s;ure a&s;k the meaning of.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>4.</HI> Think a little &s;ometimes by your&s;elf about God and heaven, and your &s;oul, and what Chri&s;t came in|to the world for.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>5.</HI> And if you have no great mind to do thus, but had rather be at play, then think, what it is that makes me that I do not care for good things; is this like one of God's dear children? I am afraid I am none of God's child, I feel I do not love to come unto him: O! What &s;hall I do! Either I will be God's child or the devil's: O what &s;hall I do? I would not be the devil's child for any thing in the world.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB REF="11"><HI>6.</HI> Then go to your father or mother, or &s;ome good per&s;on, and a&s;k them what thou &s;halt do to be God's child; and tell them that thou art afraid, and that thou can&s;t not be contented till thou ha&s;t got the love of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>7.</HI> Get by thy&s;elf, into the chamber or garret, and fall upon thy knees, and weep and mourn, and tell Chri&s;t thou art afraid that he doth not love thee, but that thou would fain have his love; beg of him to give thee his grace and pardon for thy &s;ins, and that he would make thee his child: tell God thou do&s;t not care who don't love thee, if God will but love thee, &s;ay to him, father, ha&s;t thou not a ble&s;&s;ing for me thy poor little child? Father, ha&s;t thou not a ble&s;&s;ing for me, even for me? O give me an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t! O let me not be undone for ever! Thus beg, as for your lives, and be not contented till you have an an&s;wer; and do thus every day, with as much earne&s;tne&s;s as you can, twice a-day at lea&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>8.</HI> Give your&s;elf up to Chri&s;t, &s;ay dear Je&s;us, thou did&s;t bid that little children &s;hould be &s;uffered to come unto thee, and Lord, I am come as well as I can, would fain be thy child; take my heart, and make it humble, and meek, and &s;en&s;ible, and obedient. I give my&s;elf unto thee, dear Je&s;us, do what thou wilt with me, &s;o that thou will but love me, and give me thy grace and glory.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="9"><HI>9.</HI> Get acquainted with godly people, and a&s;k them good que&s;tions, and endeavour to love their talk.</P>

And now dear chil|dren I have done, I have written to you, I have pray|ed for you; but what you will do, I can't tell. O children, if you love me, if you love your parents, if you love your &s;ouls, if you would e&s;cape hell fire, and if you would live in heaven when you die, do you go and do as the&s;e good children. And that you may be your parents joy, your country's honour, and live in God's fear, and die in his love, is the prayer of your dear friend,</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="example">
<HEAD><HI>EXAMPLE I.</HI> Of one eminently converted, between eight and nine years old, with an account of her life and death.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. <HI>Sarah Howley,</HI> when &s;he was between eight and nine years old, was carried by her friends to hear a &s;ermon, where the mini&s;ter preach|ed upon <HI>Mat.</HI> xi. 13. <HI>My yoke is ea&s;y, and my burden is light:</HI> in the applying of which &s;cripture, this child was mightily awakened, and made deeply &s;en|&s;ible of the condition of her &s;oul, and her need of Chri&s;t; &s;he wept bitterly to think what a ca&s;e &s;he was in; and went home and got by her&s;elf into a chamber, and upon her knees &s;he wept and cried to the Lord as well as &s;he could, which might ea&s;ily be perceived by her eyes and countenance.</P>
<P N="2">2. She was not contented at this, but &s;he got her little brother and &s;i&s;ter into a chamber with her, and told them of their condition by nature, and wept over them, and prayed with them and for them.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="2" REF="14">3. After this &s;he heard another &s;ermon upon <HI>Prov.</HI> xxix. 1. <HI>He that, being often reproved, hardneth his heart, &s;hall &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed, and that without remedy:</HI> at which &s;he was more affected than before, and was &s;o exceeding &s;ollicitous about her &s;oul, that &s;he &s;pent a great part of the night in weeping and praying, and could &s;carce take any re&s;t day or night for &s;ome time together, de&s;iring with all her &s;oul to e&s;cape from everla&s;ting flames, and to get an intere&s;t in the Lord Je&s;us; O what &s;hould &s;he do for Chri&s;t! what &s;hould &s;he do to be &s;aved?</P>
<P N="4">4. She gave her&s;elf much to attending upon the word preached, and &s;till continued very tender un|der it, greatly favouring what &s;he heard.</P>
<P N="5">5. She was very much in &s;ecret prayer, as might ea&s;ily be perceived by tho&s;e who li&s;tened at the chamber door, and was u&s;ually very importunate, full of tears.</P>
<P N="6">6. She could &s;carce &s;peak of &s;in, or be &s;poke to, but her heart was ready to melt.</P>
<P N="7">7. She &s;pent much time in reading the &s;cripture, and a book called <HI>The be&s;t friend in the wor&s;t of times;</HI> by which the work of God was much pro|moted upon her &s;oul, and was much directed by it how to get acquaintance with God, e&s;pecially to|ward the end of that book. Another book that &s;he was much delighted with, was Mr. <HI>Swinnock</HI>'s <HI>Chri&s;tian Man's Calling,</HI> and by this &s;he was taught in this mea&s;ure to make religion her bu&s;ine&s;s. The <HI>Spiritual Bee</HI> was a great companion of hers.</P>
<P N="8">8. She was exceeding dutiful to her parents, very loath to grieve them in the lea&s;t: and if &s;he had at any time (which was very rare) offended them &s;he would weep bitterly.</P>
<P N="9">9. She abhorred lying, and allowed her&s;elf in no known &s;in.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="3" REF="15">10. She was very con&s;cientious in &s;pending of time, and hated idlene&s;s, and &s;pent her whole time either in praying, reading, in&s;tructing at her needle, at which &s;he was very ingenious.</P>
<P N="11">11. When &s;he was at &s;chool, &s;he was eminent for her diligence, teachablene&s;s, meekne&s;s and mode&s;ty, &s;peaking little; but when &s;he did &s;peak, it was u&s;u|ally &s;piritual.</P>
<P N="12">12. She continued in this cour&s;e of religious duties for &s;ome years together.</P>
<P N="13">13. When &s;he was about fourteen years old, &s;he brake a vein in her lungs (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) and oft did &s;pit blood, yet did a little recover again, but had &s;everal dangerous relap&s;es.</P>
<P N="14">14. At the beginning of <HI>January</HI> la&s;t &s;he was taken very bad again, in which &s;ickne&s;s &s;he was in great di&s;tre&s;s of &s;oul. When &s;he was fir&s;t taken &s;he &s;aid, O mother, pray, pray, pray for me, for Satan is &s;o bu&s;y that I cannot pray for my&s;elf; I &s;ee I am undone without Chri&s;t, and a pardon!

His &s;ickne&s;s la&s;ted long, and at lea&s;t three days before his death he prophe&s;ied his departure, and not only that he mu&s;t die, but the very day. <HI>On the Lord's day,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>look to me:</HI> neither was this a word of cour&s;e, which you may gue&s;s by his often repetition, every day a&s;king till the day came indeed, <HI>What is Sunday c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me?</HI> At la&s;t the looked for day came on; and no &s;ooner had the &s;un beautified that morning with its light, but he falls into a trance, his eyes were fixed, his face chearful, his lips &s;miling, his hands and face cla&s;p|ed in a bow, as if he would have received &s;ome ble&s;&s;ed angel that were at hand to receive his &s;oul. But he comes to him&s;elf, and tells them how he &s;aw the &s;weete&s;t body that ever eyes beheld, who bid him be of good cheer, for he mu&s;t pre&s;ently go with him.</P>
<P N="20">20. One that &s;tood near him, as now &s;u&s;pecting the time of his di&s;&s;olution nigh, bid him &s;ay, Lord, into thy hands I commend my &s;pirit, which is thy

<HEAD><HI>EXAMPLE VI.</HI> Of a poor Child that was awakened when he was about five Years old.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A Certain very poor child, that had a very bad father, but it was to be hoped a very good mother, was, by the providence of God, brought to the &s;ight of a godly friend of mine, who upon the fir&s;t &s;ight of the child had a great pity for him, and took an affection to him, and had a mind to bring him up for Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. At the fir&s;t he did with great &s;weetne&s;s and kindne&s;s allure the child, by which means it was not long before he got a deep intere&s;t in the heart of the child, and he began to obey him with more readine&s;s than children u&s;ually do their parents.</P>
<P N="3">3. By this a door was opened for a farther work,
<PB N="25" REF="37">and he had a greater advantage to in&s;till &s;piritual principles into the &s;oul of the child, which he was not wanting in, as the Lord gave opportunity, and the child was capable of.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was not long before the Lord was plea&s;ed to &s;trike in with the &s;piritual exhortations of this good man, &s;o that the child was brought to a liking of the things of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. He quickly learned great part of the a&s;&s;em|bly's catechi&s;m by heart, and that before he could read his primmer within book; and he took a great delight in learning his catechi&s;m.</P>
<P N="6">6. He was not only able to give a very good ac|count of his catechi&s;m, but he would an&s;wer &s;uch que&s;tions as are not in the catechi&s;m, with greater under&s;tanding than could be expected from one of his age.</P>
<P N="7">7. He took great delight in di&s;cour&s;ing about the things of God; and when my friend had been either praying or reading, expounding or repeat|ing of &s;ermons, he &s;eemed very attentive, and ready to receive the truths of God, and would with in|credible gravity, diligence and affection wait till duties were ended, to the no &s;mall joy and admira|tion of them which ob&s;erved him.</P>
<P N="8">8. He would a&s;k very excellent que&s;tions, and di&s;cour&s;e about the condition of his &s;oul and hea|venly things, and &s;eemed mightily concerned what &s;hould become of his &s;oul when he &s;hould dye: &s;o that his di&s;cour&s;e made &s;ome chri&s;tians even to &s;tand a&s;toni&s;hed.</P>
<P N="9">9. He was greatly taken with the great kindne&s;s of Chri&s;t in dying for &s;inners, and would be in tears at the mention of them; and &s;eemed at a &s;trange rate to be affected with the un&s;peakable love of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="26" REF="38">10. When no body had been &s;peaking to him, he would bur&s;t out into tears, and being a&s;ked the rea&s;on, he would &s;ay, that the very thoughts of Chri&s;t's love to &s;inners in &s;uffering for them, made him that he could not but cry.</P>
<P N="11">11. Before he was &s;ix years old, he made con|&s;cience of &s;ecret duty; and when he prayed, it was with &s;uch extraordinary meltings, that his eyes have looked red and &s;ore with weeping by him&s;elf for his &s;ins.</P>
<P N="12">12. He would be putting of Chri&s;tians upon &s;pi|ritual di&s;cour&s;e when he &s;aw them, and &s;eemed little &s;atisfied unle&s;s they were talking of good things.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is evident, that this poor child's thoughts were very much bu&s;ied about the things of another world, for he would oftentimes be &s;peaking to his bed-follow at mid-night about the matters of his &s;oul; and when he could not &s;leep, he would take hea|venly conference to be &s;weeter than his appointed re&s;t. This was his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, and thus he would provoke and put forward an experienced chri&s;tian to &s;pend waking hours in talk of God, and the ever|la&s;ting re&s;t.</P>
<P N="14">14. Not long after this, his good mother dyed, which went very near his heart, for he greatly ho|noured his mother.</P>
<P N="15">15. After the death of his mother, he would often repeat &s;ome of the promi&s;es that are made unto fatherle&s;s children, e&s;pecially that in <HI>Exod.</HI> xxii. 22. <HI>Ye &s;hall not afflict any widow, or the fa|therle&s;s child; if thou afflict them in any wi&s;e, and they cry at all unto me, I will &s;urely hear their cry.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e words he would often repeat with tears, and &s;ay, I am fatherle&s;s and mother|le&s;s upon earth, yet if any wrong me, I have a fa|ther
<PB N="27" REF="39">in heaven who will take my part; to him I commit my&s;elf, and in him is all my tru&s;t.</P>
<P N="16">16. Thus he continued in a cour&s;e of holy duties, living in the fear of God, and &s;hewed wonderful grace for a child, and died &s;weetly in the faith of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>My friend is a judicious Chri&s;tian of many years experience, who was no ways related to him, but a con&s;tant eye and ear witne&s;s of his godly life, honourable and chearful death, from whom I re|ceived this information.</P>

<HEAD><HI>EXAMPLE VII.</HI> Of a notorious wicked Child, that was taken up from begging, and admirably convert|ed; with an account of his Holy Life and Joyful Death, when he was nine Years old.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A Very poor child of the pari&s;h of <HI>Newington-Butts,</HI> came begging to the door of a dear chri&s;tian friend of mine, in a mo&s;t lamentable con|dition; but it plea&s;ed God to rai&s;e in the heart of my friend a great pity and tenderne&s;s towards this poor child, &s;o that in charity he took him out of the &s;treets, who&s;e parents were unknown, who had no|thing at all in him to commend him to any one's cha|rity but his mi&s;ery. My friend eyeing the glory of God, and the good of the immortal &s;oul of this wretched creature, di&s;charged the pari&s;h of the child, and took him as his own, de&s;igning to bring him up in the fear of the Lord. A noble piece of charity! And that which did make the kindne&s;s far the greater
<PB N="28" REF="40">was, that there &s;eemed to be very little hopes of doing any good upon this child, for he was a very mon&s;ter of wickedne&s;s, and a thou&s;and times more mi&s;erable and vile by his &s;in, than by his poverty. He was running to hell as &s;oon as he could go, and was old in naughtine&s;s when he was young in years; and one &s;hall &s;carce hear of one &s;o like the devil in his infancy, as this poor child was. What &s;in was there (that his age was capable of) that he did not commit? What by the corruption of his nature, and the abominable example of little beg|gar-boys, he was arrived to a &s;trange pitch of im|piety.

<P N="2">2. But this &s;in and mi&s;ery was but a &s;tronger motive to that gracious man to pity him, and to do all that po&s;&s;ibly he could to pluck this fire-brand out of the fire; and it was not long before the Lord was plea&s;ed to let him under&s;tand that he had a de|&s;ign of everla&s;ting kindne&s;s upon the &s;oul of this poor child; for no &s;ooner had this good man taken this creature into his hou&s;e, but he prays for him. and labours with all his might to convince him of his mi&s;erable condition by nature, and to teach him &s;omething of God, the worth of his &s;oul, and that eternity of glory or mi&s;ery that he was born to; and ble&s;&s;ed be free grace, it was not long before the Lord was plea&s;ed to &s;hew-him that it was him&s;elf which did put it into his heart to take in this child, that he might bring him up for Chri&s;t.

<P N="4">4. It was the great care of his godly ma&s;ter to &s;trike in with tho&s;e convictions which the Lord had made, and to improve them all he could; and he was not a little glad to &s;ee his labour was not in vain in the Lord; he &s;till experiences that the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oth carry on his own work mightily upon the heart of the child; he is &s;till more and more bro|ken under a &s;en&s;e of his undone &s;tate by nature; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e is often in tears, and bemoaning his lo&s;t and mi|&s;erable condition.

<P N="6">6. Thus he continued &s;eeking after the know|ledge
<PB N="30" REF="44">of God and Chri&s;t, and practi&s;ing holy du|ties, till the &s;ickne&s;s came into the hou&s;e, with which the child was &s;mitten; at his fir&s;t &s;ickening the poor child was greatly amazed and afraid, and, though his pains were great, and his di&s;temper very tedious, yet the &s;en&s;e of his &s;in, and the thought of the mi&s;erable condition that he feared his &s;oul was &s;till in, made his trouble ten times greater; he was in grievous agonies of &s;pirit, and his former &s;ins &s;tared him in the face, and made him tremble; the poi&s;on of God's arrows did even drink up his &s;pirit; the &s;en&s;e of &s;in and wrath was &s;o great, that he could not tell what in the world to do; the weight of God's di&s;plea&s;ure, and the thoughts of lying under it to all e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ernity, did even break him to pieces, and he did cry out very bitterly, what &s;hould he do? he was a mi&s;erable &s;inner, and he feared that he &s;hould go to hell; his &s;ins had been &s;o great and &s;o many, that there were no hopes for him. He was not by far &s;o much concerned for his life, as for his &s;oul, what would become of that for ever. Now the plague upon his body &s;eemed nothing to that which was in his &s;oul.</P>
<P N="7">7. But in this great di&s;tre&s;s, the Lord was plea&s;ed to &s;end one to take care of his &s;oul, who urged to him the great and precious promi&s;es which were made to one in his condition, telling him, that there was enough in Chri&s;t for the chiefe&s;t of &s;inners, and that he came to &s;eek and &s;ave &s;uch a lo&s;t creature as he was. But this poor child found it a very difficult thing for him to believe that there was any mercy for &s;uch a dreadful &s;inner as he had been.</P>
<P N="8">8. He was made to cry out of him&s;elf, not only for his &s;wearing and lying, and other outwardly notorious &s;ins; but he was in great horror for the &s;in of his nature, for the vilene&s;s of his heart, and
<PB N="31" REF="45">original corruption under it; he was in &s;o great an|gui&s;h, that the trouble of his &s;pirit made him in a great mea&s;ure to forget the pains of his body.</P>
<P N="9">9. He did very particularly confe&s;s and bewail his &s;ins with tears; and &s;ome &s;ins &s;o &s;ecret, that none in the world could charge him with.</P>
<P N="10">10. He would condemn him&s;elf for &s;in, as de|&s;erving to have no mercy, thought that there was not a greater &s;inner in all <HI>London</HI> than him&s;elf, and he abhorred him&s;elf as the vile&s;t creature he knew.</P>
<P N="11">11. He did not only pray much, with &s;trong cries and tears him&s;elf, but he begged the prayers of Chri&s;tians for him.</P>
<P N="12">12. He would a&s;k chri&s;tians, whether they thought there were any hopes for him, and would beg of them to deal plainly with him, for he was greatly afraid of being deceived.</P>
<P N="13">13. Being informed how willing and ready the Lord Je&s;us was to accept of poor &s;inners, upon their repentance and turning, and being coun&s;elled to venture him&s;elf upon Chri&s;t for mercy and &s;alva|tion, he &s;aid he would fain ca&s;t him&s;elf upon Chri&s;t, but he could not but wonder how Chri&s;t &s;hould be willing to die for &s;uch a vile wretch as he was, and he found it one of the harde&s;t things in the world to believe.</P>
<P N="14">14. But at la&s;t it plea&s;ed the Lord to give him &s;ome &s;mall hopes that there might be mercy for him, for he had been the chiefe&s;t of &s;inners; and, he was made to lay a little hold upon &s;uch promi&s;es, as that, <HI>Come unto me all ye that are weary and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">avy laden, and I will give you re&s;t.</HI> But O how did this poor boy admire and ble&s;s God for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;t hopes! How highly did he advance free and rich grace, that &s;hould pity and pardon him! and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t he was full of prai&s;e, and admiring of God,
<PB N="32" REF="46">&s;o that (to &s;peak in the words of a good man, that was an eye and an ear-witne&s;s) to the prai&s;e and glory of God be it &s;poken, the hou&s;e at that day, for all the &s;ickne&s;s in it, was a little lower heaven, &s;o full of joy and prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="15">15. The child grew exceedingly in knowledge, experience, patience, humility, and &s;elf-abhorrence; and he thought he could never &s;peak bad enough of him&s;elf, the name that he would call him&s;elf by, was a toad.</P>
<P N="16">16. And though he prayed before, yet now the Lord poured out upon him the &s;pirit of prayer in an extraordinary manner, for one of his age; &s;o that now he prayed more frequently, more earne&s;t|ly, more &s;piritually than ever. O how eagerly would he beg to be wa&s;hed in the blood of Je&s;us! and that the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, that was over heaven and earth, and &s;ea, would par|don and forgive him all his &s;ins, and receive his &s;oul into his kingdom. And what he &s;poke, it was with &s;o much life and fervour of &s;pirit, as that it filled the hearers with a&s;toni&s;hment and joy.</P>
<P N="17">17. He had no &s;mall &s;en&s;e of the u&s;e and excel|lency of Chri&s;t, and &s;uch longings and breathings of his &s;oul after him, that when mention had been made of Chri&s;t, he hath been ready almo&s;t to leap out of his bed for joy.</P>
<P N="18">18. When he was told, that if he &s;hould reco|ver, he mu&s;t not live as he li&s;t; but he mu&s;t give up him&s;elf to Chri&s;t, and be his child and &s;ervant, bear his yoke, and be obedient unto his laws, and live a holy life, and take his cro&s;s, and &s;uffer mocking and reproach, it may be per&s;ecution for his name &s;ake. Now, child (&s;aid one to him) are you willing to have Chri&s;t upon &s;uch terms? He &s;ignified his willingne&s;s by the earne&s;tne&s;s of his looks
<PB N="33" REF="47">and words, and the ca&s;ting up of his eyes to hea|ven, &s;aying, yes, with all my &s;oul, the Lord help|ing me, I will do this.</P>
<P N="19">19. Yet he had many doubts, and fears, and was ever and anon harping upon that, that though he were willing, yet Chri&s;t he feared was not willing to accept him, becau&s;e of the greatne&s;s of his &s;in; yet his hopes were greater than his fears.</P>
<P N="20">20. The <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> before he died, the child lay as it were in a trance for about half an hour, in which time he thought he &s;aw a vi&s;ion of angels: when he was out of his trance, he was a little un|ea&s;y, and a&s;ked his nur&s;e, why &s;he did not let him go? Go whither, child, &s;aid &s;he? Why along with tho&s;e brave gentlemen, &s;aid he; but they told me, they would come and fetch me away for all you upon <HI>Friday</HI> next. And he doubled his words many times, upon <HI>Friday</HI> next tho&s;e brave gentlemen will come for me; and upon that day the child died joyfully.</P>
<P N="21">21. He was very thankful to his ma&s;ter, and very &s;en&s;ible of his great kindne&s;s in taking him up out of the &s;treets when he was a begging, and he admired at the goodne&s;s of God, which put it into the mind of a &s;tranger to look upon, and to take &s;uch fatherly care of &s;uch a pitiful &s;orry crea|ture as he was. O my dear ma&s;ter, (&s;aid he) I hope to &s;ee you in heaven, for I am &s;ure you will go thither. O ble&s;&s;ed, ble&s;&s;ed be God that made you to take pity upon me, for I might have died, and have gone to the devil, and have been damned for ever, if it had not been for you.</P>
<P N="22">22. The <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> before he died, he a&s;ked a very godly friend of mine what he thought of his condition, and whither his &s;oul was now going? for he &s;aid he could not &s;till but fear, le&s;t he &s;hould deceive dim&s;elf with fal&s;e hopes; at which my friend
<PB N="34" REF="48">&s;poke to him thus: child, for all that I have en|deavoured to hold forth the grace of God in Chri&s;t to thy &s;oul, and given you a warrant from the word of God, that Chri&s;t is as freely offered to you, as to any &s;inner in the world; if thou art but willing to accept of him, thou maye&s;t have Chri&s;t and all that thou do&s;t want, with him; and yet thou give&s;t way to the&s;e thy doubtings and fears, as though I told thee nothing but lyes; thou &s;aye&s;t, thou feare&s;t that Chri&s;t will not accept of thee, I fear thou art not heartily willing to accept of him. The child an&s;wered, indeed I am: why then child, if thou art unfeignedly willing to have Chri&s;t, I tell thee, he is a thou&s;and times more willing to have thee, and wa&s;h thee, and &s;ave thee, than thou art to de&s;ire it. And now at this time Chri&s;t offers him&s;elf freely to thee again, therefore receive him humbly by &s;aith into thy heart, and bid him welcome, for he de&s;erv|eth it: upon which words the Lord di&s;covered his love to the child; and he gave a kind of leap in his bed, and &s;napped his fingers and thumb together with abundance of joy, as much as to &s;ay, well, yea, all is well, the match is made, Chri&s;t is willing, and I am willing too; and now Chri&s;t is mine, and I am his for ever. And from that time forward, in full joy and a&s;&s;urance of God's love, he continued earne&s;tly prai&s;ing God, with de&s;iring to die, and be with Chri&s;t. And on Friday morning he &s;weetly went to re&s;t, u&s;ing that very expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Into thy hands, Lord, I commit my &s;pirit.</HI> He died punctually at that time which he had &s;poke of, and in which he expected tho&s;e angels to come to him; he was not much above nine years old when he died.</P>
<P>This narrative I had from a judicious holy man, unrelated to him, who was an eye and ear-witne&s;s to all the&s;e things.</P>

<P>IN the former part of my <HI>Token</HI> for <HI>Children,</HI> I did in part promi&s;e, that if that piece met with kind entertainment, it might be followed with a &s;econd of the &s;ame nature.

<HEAD>A TOKEN FOR CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Second Part.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="example">
<HEAD><HI>EXAMPLE VIII.</HI> Of a child that was very &s;erious at four years old, with an account of his comforta|ble death when he was twelve years and three weeks old.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>JOHN SUDLOW</HI> was born of religious parents in the county of <HI>Middle&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x,</HI> who&s;e great care was to in&s;til &s;piritual principles into him as &s;oon as he was capable of under&s;tanding of them: who&s;e endeavours the Lord was plea&s;ed to crown with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s: &s;o that (to u&s;e the expre&s;|&s;ion of a holy man concerning him) &s;carce-more could be expected or de&s;ired from &s;o little a one.</P>
<P N="2">2. When he was &s;carce able to &s;peak plain, he &s;eemed to have a very great awe and reverence of God upon his &s;pirit, and a &s;trange &s;en&s;e of the things of another world, as might ea&s;ily be per|ceived by tho&s;e &s;erious and admirable que&s;tions which he would be oft a&s;king of tho&s;e chri&s;tians that he thought he might be bold with.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="2" REF="56">3. The fir&s;t thing that did mo&s;t affect him, and make him endeavour to e&s;cape from the wrath to come, and to enquire what he &s;hould do to be &s;aved, was the death of a little brother; when he &s;aw him without breath, and not able to &s;peak or &s;tir, and when carried out of doors, and put into a pit-hole, he was greatly concerned, and a&s;ked &s;ur|pri&s;ing que&s;tions about him; but that which was mo&s;t affecting of him&s;elf and others, was whether he mu&s;t die too, which being an&s;wered, it made &s;uch a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon him, that from that time forward he was exceeding &s;erious, and this was when he was about four years old.</P>
<P N="4">4. Now he was de&s;irous to know what he might do that he might live in another world, and what he mu&s;t avoid, that he might not die for ever, and being in|&s;tructed by his godly parents, he &s;oon labours to a|void what&s;oever might di&s;plea&s;e God; now tell him that any thing was &s;inful, and that God would not have him to do it, and he is ea&s;ily kept from it, and even at this time of day, the apprehen&s;ions of God, and death, and eternity, laid &s;uch a re&s;traint upon him, that he would not, for a world, have told a lye.</P>
<P N="5">5. He quickly learned to read exactly, and took &s;uch plea&s;ure in reading of the &s;criptures and his catechi&s;m, and other good books, that it is &s;carce to be paralleled; he would naturally run to his book without bidding: when he came home from &s;chool, and when other children of his age and ac|quaintance were playing, he reckoned it his recrea|tion to being that which is good.</P>
<P N="6">6. When he was in coats he would be a&s;king his maid &s;erious que&s;tions, and praying her to teach him his catechi&s;m, or &s;criptures, or &s;ome good thing; common di&s;cour&s;e he took no delight in, but did mo&s;t eagerly de&s;ire to be &s;ucking in of the knowledge of the things of God, Chri&s;t, his &s;oul, and another world.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="3" REF="57">7. He was greatly taken with the reading of the book of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> and would be ready to leave his dinner to go to his book.</P>
<P N="8">8. He was exceeding careful of redceming and improving of time; &s;carce a moment of it but he would give an excellent account of the expence of it; &s;o that this child might have taught elder per|&s;ons, and will que&s;tionle&s;s condemn their idle and unaccountable wa&s;ting of tho&s;e precious hours in which they &s;hould, as this &s;weet child, have been laying in provi&s;ion for eternity.</P>
<P N="9">9. He could not endure to read any thing over &s;lightly, but what&s;oever he read, he dwelt upon it, laboured to under&s;tand it thoroughly, and remem|ber it; and what he could not under&s;tand, he would oft a&s;k his father or mother the meaning of it.</P>
<P N="10">10. When any chri&s;tian friends have been di&s;|cour&s;ing with his Father, if they began to talk any thing about religion, to be &s;ure they &s;hould have his company, and of his own accord he would leave all to hear any thing of Chri&s;t, and crept as clo&s;e to them as he could, and li&s;ten as affectionately, though it were for an hour or two. He was &s;carce ever known to expre&s;s the lea&s;t token of wearine&s;s while he was hearing any thing that was good, and &s;ometimes when neighbours children would come and call him out, and entice him, and beg of him to go with them, he could by no means be per&s;uad|ed, though he might have had the leave of his pa|rents, if he had any hopes that any good boy would come into his father's hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="11">11. He was very mode&s;t whil&s;t any &s;tranger was pre&s;ent, and was loth to a&s;k them any que&s;tions: but as &s;oon as they were gone, he would let his father know, that there was little &s;aid or done but he ob&s;erved it, and would reflect upon what was
<PB N="4" REF="58">pa&s;t in their di&s;cour&s;e, and de&s;ire &s;atisfaction in what he could not under&s;tand at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="12">12. He was a boy of mo&s;t prodigious parts for his age, as will appear from his &s;olid and rational que&s;tions; I &s;hall mention but two of many</P>
<P N="13">13. The fir&s;t was this, when he was reading by him&s;elf in <HI>Draiton</HI>'s poems about <HI>Noah</HI>'s flood and the ark, he a&s;ked who built the ark? It being an|&s;wered it was likely that <HI>Noah</HI> hired men to help him to build it: and would they (&s;aid he) build an ark to &s;ave another, and not go into it them|&s;elves?</P>
<P N="14">14. Another que&s;tion he put was this: whether had a greater glory, &s;aints or angels? It being an|&s;wered, that angels were the mo&s;t excellent of crea|tures, and 'tis to be thought their nature is made capable of greater glory than man's, he &s;aid he was of another mind, and his rea&s;on was, becau&s;e an|gels were &s;ervants, and &s;aints are children; and that Chri&s;t never took upon him the nature of an|gels, but he took upon him the nature of &s;aints, and by being man, he hath advanced human nature a|bove the nature of angels.</P>
<P N="15">15. By this you may perceive the greatne&s;s of his parts, and the bent of his thoughts, and thus he continued for &s;everal years together, labouring to get more and more &s;piritual knowledge, and to prepare for an endle&s;s life.</P>
<P N="16">16. He was a child of an excellent &s;weet tem|per, wonderful dutiful to his parents, ready and joyful to do what he was bid, and by no means would do any thing to di&s;plea&s;e them, and if they were at any time &s;eemingly angry, he would not &s;tir from them till they were thoroughly reconciled to him.</P>
<P N="17">17. He was not only good him&s;elf, but would do what he could to make others &s;o too, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that were neare&s;t to him; he was very watch|ful
<PB N="5" REF="59">over his brethren and &s;i&s;ters, and would not &s;uf|fer them to u&s;e any unhand&s;ome words, or to do any unhand&s;ome action; but he would be putting them upon that which was good, and when he did at any time rebuke them, it was not childi&s;hly and &s;lightly, but with great gravity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, as one that was not a little concerned for God's ho|nour, and the eternal welfare of their &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="18">18. He would go to his father and mother with great tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion (being far from telling of tales) and beg of them to take more care of the &s;ouls of his brethren and &s;i&s;ters, and to take heed le&s;t they &s;hould go on in a &s;inful Chri&s;tle&s;s &s;tate, and prove their &s;orrow and &s;hame, and go to hell when they die, and be ruined for ever.</P>
<P N="19">19. He was exceedingly affected with hearing of the word of God preached, and could not be &s;atis|fied except he could carry home much of the &s;ub|&s;tance of what he heard; to this end he quickly got to learn &s;hort-hand, and would give a very pretty account of any &s;ermon that he heard.</P>
<P N="20">20. He was much engaged in &s;ecret duty, and in reading the &s;criptures; to be &s;ure morning and evening he would be by him&s;elf, and was, no que&s;|tion, wre&s;tling with God.</P>
<P N="21">21. He would get choice &s;criptures by heart, and was very perfect at his catechi&s;m.</P>
<P N="22">22. The providences of God were not pa&s;&s;ed by without con&s;iderable ob&s;ervation by him.</P>
<P N="23">23. In the time of the plague he was exceeding|ly concerned about his &s;oul and everla&s;ting &s;tate; very much by him&s;elf upon his knees. This prayer was found written in &s;hort-hand after his death.</P>
<P><HI>O Lord God and merciful Father, take pity upon me a mi&s;erable &s;inner, and &s;trengthen me, O Lord, in thy faith, and make me one of thy glorious &s;aints in heaven. O Lord keep me from this poi&s;onous in|fection;
<PB N="6" REF="60">however, not my will but thy will be done, O Lord, on earth, as it is in heaven; but, O Lord, if thou ha&s;t appointed me to die by it, O Lord, fit me for death, and give me a good heart to bear up under my afflictions: O Lord God and merciful fa|ther, take pity on me thy child, teach me O Lord thy word, make me &s;trong in faith. O Lord, I have &s;inned again&s;t thee, Lord pardon my &s;ins; I had been in hell long ago if it had not been for thy mercy; O Lord, I pray thee to keep my parents in thy truth, and &s;ave them from this infection, if it be thy will, that they may live to bring me up in thy truth: O Lord I pray thee &s;tay this infection that rageth in this city, and pardon their &s;ins, and try them once more, and &s;ee if they will turn unto thee.

<P N="40">40. She further urged the &s;in and &s;orrow that did attend us in this life, and the longer we live, the more we &s;in; now the Lord will free me from that &s;in and &s;orrow.

She comforted her&s;elf and her father in that excellent &s;cripture, Rom. viii 15, 16, 17. <HI>Ye have not received the &s;pirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the &s;pirit of adoption, by which ye cry</HI> Abba Father. <HI>It is the &s;pirit that witne&s;&s;eth with our &s;pirits, that we are the children of God; and if children, then we are heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chri&s;t.</HI> You &s;ee thence, father, that I &s;hall be a fellow-heir with Chri&s;t, who hath &s;aid, <HI>in my Father's hou&s;e are many man&s;ions, if it were not &s;o, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to my&s;elf, that where I am there ye may be al&s;o.</HI> O Lord, take me to thy&s;elf. Behold, dear mo|ther, he hath prepared a place and dwelling for me.</P>
<P N="44">44. Yea, my dear child, &s;aid her mother, he &s;hall &s;trengthen you with his holy &s;pirit, until he
<PB N="25" REF="79">hath fitted and prepared you fully for that place which he hath provided for you.</P>
<P N="45">45. Yea, mother, it is &s;aid in P&s;alm lxxxiv. <HI>How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of ho&s;ts, my &s;ould doth thir&s;t for the courts of the Lord: one day in thy courts is better than a thou&s;and; yea, I had ra|ther be a door-keeper in the hou&s;e of God, than dwell in the tents of the wicked.</HI> Read that p&s;alm, dear mother, wherewith we may comfort one another. As for me, I am more and more &s;pent, and draw near my la&s;t hour.</P>
<P N="46">46. Then &s;he de&s;ired to be prayed with, and begged that the Lord would give her an ea&s;y pa&s;|&s;age.</P>
<P N="47">47. After this &s;he turned to her mother, and, with much affection, &s;he &s;aid, ah my dear and loving mother, that which cometh from the heart, doth ordinarily go to the heart, once more come and ki&s;s me before I leave you.</P>
<P N="48">48. She was not a little concerned about the &s;ouls of the re&s;t of her relations, and did particularly charge it upon her father to do what he could po&s;|&s;ibly to bring them up in the ways of God. O let my &s;i&s;ter be trained up in the &s;criptures, and cate|chi&s;ing, as I have been.</P>
<P N="49">49. I formerly wept for my &s;i&s;ter, thinking that &s;he would die before me, and now &s;he weepeth for me, and then &s;he ki&s;&s;ed her weeping &s;i&s;ter; al&s;o &s;he took her young little &s;i&s;ter in her arms, a child of &s;ix months old, and &s;he ki&s;&s;ed it with much af|fection, as if her very bowels had moved within her, and &s;poke with many heart-breaking words, both to her parents and the children.</P>
<P N="50">50. Her father &s;pake to one that was by, to take the poor little child away from her, from the hazard of that fiery di&s;temper, and bid his daughter
<PB N="26" REF="80">to give her to them, for he had already too much to bear. Well father, &s;aid &s;he, did not God pre|&s;erve the three children in the fiery furnace; and did you not teach me that &s;cripture? <HI>when thou pa&s;&s;e&s;t through the fire, thou &s;halt not be burnt, neither &s;hall the flame kindle upon thee.</HI></P>
<P N="51">51. She had a very &s;trong faith in the doctrine of the re&s;urrection, and did greatly &s;olace her &s;oul with excellent &s;criptures, which do &s;peak the happy &s;tate of believers, as &s;oon as their &s;ouls are &s;epa|rated from their bodies, and what &s;he quoted out of the &s;cripture, &s;he did excellently and &s;uitably ap|ply to her own u&s;e, incomparably above the com|mon reach of her &s;ex and age. That in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 42. was a good &s;upport to her, <HI>The body is &s;own in corruption, but it &s;hall be rai&s;ed incorruptible; it is &s;own in di&s;honour, it &s;hall be rai&s;ed in glory; it is &s;own in weakne&s;s, but it &s;hall be rai&s;ed in power.</HI> And then &s;he &s;weetly applies it, and takes in this cordial. Behold, thus it is, and thus it &s;hall be with my mortal fle&s;h, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead which die in the Lord, becau&s;e they re&s;t from their labours, and their works do follow them. The righteous peri&s;h, and no man layeth it to heart; and the upright are taken away, and no man regardeth it, that they are taken away from the evil to come, they &s;hall enter into peace, they &s;hall re&s;t in their beds every one who walked in their uprightne&s;s.</HI> Behold, now father, I &s;hall re&s;t and &s;leep in that bed-chamber.</P>
<P N="52">52. Then &s;he quoted <HI>Job</HI> xix. 25, 26, 27. <HI>I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he &s;hall &s;tand at the latter end upon the earth; and though after my &s;kin, worms de&s;troy this body, yet in my fle&s;h &s;hall I &s;ee God; whom I &s;hall &s;ee for my&s;elf, and my eyes &s;hall behold, and not another's, though
<PB N="27" REF="81">my reins be con&s;umed within me.</HI> Behold now, fa|ther, this very &s;kin which you &s;ee, and this very fle&s;h which you &s;ee, &s;hall be rai&s;ed up again; and the&s;e very eyes which now are &s;o dim, &s;hall, on that day, &s;ee and behold my dear and precious re|deemer albeit the worms eat up my fle&s;h, yet with the&s;e eyes &s;hall I behold God, even I my&s;elf, and not another for me.</P>
<P N="53">53. Then &s;he quoted <HI>John</HI> v. 28. <HI>Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in which all that are in their graves &s;hall hear his voice, and come forth; tho&s;e that have done good unto the re&s;urrection of life.</HI> See, father, I &s;hall ri&s;e in that day, and then I &s;hall behold my redeemer; then &s;hall he &s;ay, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my father, inherit the king|dom prepared for you before the beginning of the world.</HI></P>
<P N="54">54. <HI>Behold now I live, yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me, and the life that I now live in the fle&s;h is by the faith of the &s;on of God, who loved me, and gave him&s;elf for me. I am &s;aved, and that not of my&s;elf, it is the gift of God, not of works, lea&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="55">55. My dear parents, now we mu&s;t &s;hortly part, my &s;peech faileth me, pray to the Lord for a quiet clo&s;e to my combat.</P>
<P N="56">56. Her parents replied, ah our dear child! How &s;ad is that to us, that we mu&s;t part? &s;he an&s;wered, I go to heaven, and there we &s;hall find one another again; I go to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="57">57. Then &s;he comforted her&s;elf to think of her &s;eeing her precious brother and &s;i&s;ter again in glory. I go to my brother <HI>Jacob,</HI> who did &s;o much cry and call upon God to the la&s;t moment of his breath: and to my little &s;i&s;ter, who was but three years old when &s;he died: who, when we a&s;ked
<PB N="28" REF="82">her, whether &s;he would die? an&s;wered yes, if it be the Lord's will. I will go to my little brother if it be the Lord's will, or I will &s;tay with my mo|ther, if it be the Lord's will. But I know that I &s;hall die, and go to heaven and to God. O &s;ee, how &s;o &s;mall a babe had &s;o much given it, to be have it&s;elf every way, and in all things &s;o &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ively to the will of God, as if it had no will of its own; but if it be the will of God, if it plea&s;e God; nothing for her, but what was the will and plea|&s;ure of God; and therefore dear father and mother, give the Lord thanks for this his free and rich grace, and then I &s;hall the more gladly be gone. Be gra|cious then, O Lord unto me al&s;o, be gracious to me, wa&s;h me throughly from my unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and clean&s;e me from my &s;in.</P>
<P N="58">58. After this, her &s;pirit was refre&s;hed with the &s;en&s;e of the pardon of her &s;ins, which made her to cry out, behold, God hath wa&s;hed away my &s;ins, O how do I long to die! The apo&s;tle &s;aid, <HI>in this body we earne&s;tly &s;igh and groan, longing for our hou&s;e which is in heaven, that we may be cloathed therewith.</HI> Now I al&s;o lie here &s;ighing and long|ing for that dwelling which is above. In the la&s;t &s;ermon which I heard, or ever &s;hall hear, I heard this, which is matter of great comfort unto me.</P>
<P N="59">59. Then &s;he repeated &s;everal notable &s;criptures which were quoted in that &s;ermon, afterward &s;he de&s;ired to be prayed with, and put petitions into their mouths, <HI>viz.</HI> That all her &s;ins might be for|given, that &s;he might have more abundant faith, and the a&s;&s;urance of it; and the comfort of that a&s;&s;urance, and the continuation and &s;trength of that comfort, according as her nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould require. Afterwards &s;he prayed her&s;elf, and continued &s;ome time.</P>
<P N="60"><PB N="29" REF="83">60. When prayers were ended, &s;he called to her father and mother, and demanded of them, whe|ther &s;he had at any time angred or grieved them, or done any thing that did not become her? And begged of them to forgive her.</P>
<P N="61">61. They an&s;wered her, that if all children had carried them&s;elves &s;o to their parents as &s;he had done, there would be le&s;s grief and &s;orrow on all hands than there is; and if any &s;uch thing had e&s;|caped thee, we would forgive it with all our hearts, you have done as became a good child.</P>
<P N="62">62. Her heart being comforted with her peace with God and he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> parents, &s;he began to di&s;po&s;e of her books; particularly &s;he intreated her mother to keep Mr. <HI>De Wit</HI>'s catechi&s;e lectures, as long as &s;he lived, for her &s;ake, and let my little &s;i&s;ter have my other books, in remembrance of me.</P>
<P N="63">63. Then, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he felt her brea&s;t exceeding|ly pained, by which &s;he knew that her end was very nigh. Her father &s;pake to her as he was able, telling her, the Lord would be her &s;trength in the hour of her nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P N="64">64. Yea, (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>The Lord is my &s;hepherd, al|though I pa&s;s through the valley of the &s;hadow of death, I will not fear, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy &s;taff, they comfort me:</HI> And it is &s;aid, <HI>the &s;ufferings of this pre&s;ent life are not worthy to be compared with the glory that &s;hall be revealed in us.</HI> Shall I not &s;uffer and endure, &s;eeing my glo|rious redeemer was plea&s;ed to &s;uffer &s;o much for me? O how was he mocked and crowned with thorns, that he might purcha&s;e a crown of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s for us: And that is the crown of which <HI>Paul</HI> &s;poke, when he &s;aid, <HI>I have fought the good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith, henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="30" REF="84">which the Lord, the righteous judge &s;hall give unto me in that day; and not only to me, but to all who love his appearing.</HI></P>
<P N="65">65. <HI>Ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God with your &s;ouls and bodies, which are his.</HI> Mu&s;t I not then exalt and ble&s;s him while I have a being, who hath bought me with his blood? <HI>Surely he hath born our griefs, and took our infirmities, and we e&s;teemed him &s;mitten and &s;tricken of God; But he was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and brui&s;ed for our &s;ins: The cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him, and by his &s;tripes are we healed, and the Lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all. Behold the lamb of God that taketh away the &s;ins of the world:</HI> that lamb is Je&s;us Chri&s;t who hath &s;atisfied for my &s;ins. So &s;aith Paul, <HI>Ye are wa&s;hed, ye are &s;ancti|fied, ye are ju&s;tified in the name of our Lord Je&s;us, and through the &s;pirit of our God.</HI></P>
<P N="66">66. My end is now very near, now I &s;hall put on white raiment, and be cloathed before the lamb, that &s;potle&s;s lamb, and with his &s;potle&s;s righteou&s;|ne&s;s. Now are the angels making ready to carry my &s;oul before the throne of God. <HI>The&s;e are they who are come out of great tribulation, who have wa&s;hed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb.</HI></P>
<P N="67">67. She &s;poke this with a dying voice, but full of &s;pirit, and of the power of faith.</P>
<P N="68">68. Her lively a&s;&s;urance &s;he further uttered in the words of the apo&s;tle; <HI>We know that if this earthly hou&s;e of our tabernacle be di&s;&s;olved, we have one which is built of God, which is eternal in the heavens; for in this we &s;ight for our hou&s;e, which is in heaven, that we may be cloathed there|with.</HI></P>
<P N="69">69. There father, you &s;ee that my body is this

<P N="70">70. She died the fir&s;t of <HI>September</HI> 1664, betwixt &s;even and eight in the evening, in the fourteenth year of her age; having obtained that which &s;he &s;o oft intreated of the Lord, a quiet and ea&s;y depar|ture, and the end of her faith the &s;alvation of her &s;oul.</P>

<HEAD><HI>EXAMPLE XII.</HI> Of the excellent carriage of a Child upon his death-bed, when but &s;even years old.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>JAcob Bicks,</HI> the brother of <HI>Su&s;anna Bicks,</HI> was born in <HI>Leiden;</HI> and had a religious educa|tion under his godly parents, the which the Lord was plea&s;ed to &s;anctify to his conver&s;ion, and by it lay in excellent provi&s;ions to live upon in an hour of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. This &s;weet little child was vi&s;ited of the Lord of a very &s;ore &s;ickne&s;s three or four weeks before his &s;i&s;ter, of who&s;e life and death we have given you &s;ome account already: in his di&s;temper he was for the mo&s;t part very &s;leepy and drow&s;y, till near his death, but when he did awake, he was wont to be much engaged in prayer.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="32" REF="86">3. Once when his parents had been praying with him, they a&s;ked him again if they &s;hould &s;end for the phy&s;ician? No (&s;aid he) I will have the doctor no more; the Lord will help me: I know he will take me to him&s;elf, and then he &s;hall help all.</P>
<P N="4">4. Ah my dear child, &s;aid his father, that grie|veth my heart: Well (&s;aid the child) father, let us pray, and the Lord &s;hall be near for my helper.</P>
<P N="5">5. When his parents had prayed with him again, he &s;aid, come now dear father and mother, and ki&s;s me, I know that I &s;hall die.</P>
<P N="6">6. Farewell, dear father and mother, farewell dear &s;i&s;ter, farewell all. Now &s;hall I go to heaven unto God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the holy angels: Father, know you not what is &s;aid by <HI>Jeremiah: Ble&s;&s;ed is he who tru&s;teth in the Lord?</HI> Now I tru&s;t in him, and he will ble&s;s me. And in 1 <HI>John</HI> 2. it is &s;aid, <HI>Little children love not the world, for the world pa&s;&s;eth away.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Away then all that is in the world, away with all my plea&s;ant things in the world: away with my dagger, for where I go, there is nothing to do with daggers and &s;words: men &s;hall not fight there, but prai&s;e God. Away with all my books; there &s;hall I know &s;ufficiently, and be learned in all things of true wi&s;dom, without books.</P>
<P N="8">8. His father being touched to hear his child &s;peak at this rate, could not well tell what to &s;ay; but, my dear child, the Lord will be near thee, and uphold thee.</P>
<P N="9">9. Yea, father (&s;aid he) the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aid, <HI>God re&s;i&s;teth the proud, but he giveth grace to the humble.</HI> I &s;hall humble my&s;elf under the mighty hand of God, and he &s;hall help me and lift me up.</P>

<P N="12">12. Then with a &s;hort word of prayer, Lord be merciful to me a poor &s;inner, he quietly breathed out his &s;oul, and &s;weetly &s;lept in Je&s;us, when he was about &s;even years old.</P>

<HEAD><HI>EXAMPLE XIII.</HI> Of one that began to look towards heaven, when he was very young; with many emi|nent pa&s;&s;ages of his life, and joyful death, when he was eleven years and three quar|ters old.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>JOhn Harvey</HI> was born in <HI>London,</HI> in the year 1654, his father was a <HI>Dutch</HI> merchant; he was piou&s;ly educated under his virtuous mother, and &s;oon began to &s;uck in divine things with no &s;mall delight.</P>
<P N="2">2. The fir&s;t thing very ob&s;ervable in him was, that when he was two years and eight months old,
<PB N="34" REF="88">he could &s;peak as well as other children do u&s;ually at five years old.</P>
<P N="3">3. His parents judging, that he was then a little too young to &s;end out to &s;chool, let him have his liberty to play a little about home. But in|&s;tead of playing, he found out a &s;chool of his own accord hard by, and went to the &s;chool mi&s;|tre&s;s, own accord hard by, and went to the &s;chool mi&s;|tre&s;s, and intreated her to teach him to read: and &s;o he went for &s;ome time to &s;chool without the knowledge of his parents, and made a very great progre&s;s in his learning, and was able to read di&s;|tinctly, before mo&s;t children are able to know their letters.</P>
<P N="4">4. He was wont to a&s;k many &s;erious and weighty que&s;tions, about matters which concerned his &s;oul and eternity.</P>
<P N="5">5. His mother being greatly troubled upon the death of one of his uncles, this child came to his mother, and &s;aid, mother, though my uncle be dead, doth not the &s;criptures &s;ay, he mu&s;t ri&s;e again; yea, and I mu&s;t die, and &s;o mu&s;t every bo|dy, and it will not be long before Chri&s;t will come to judge the world, and then we &s;hall &s;ee one ano|ther again, I pray mother, do not weep &s;o much. This grave coun&s;el he gave his mother, when he was not quite five years old, by which her &s;orrow for her brother was turned into admiration at her child, and &s;he was made to &s;it &s;ilent and quiet un|der that &s;marting &s;troke.</P>
<P N="6">6. After this, his parents removed to <HI>Aberdeen</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;ettled their child under an able &s;chool-ma&s;ter there, who&s;e cu&s;tom was upon the Lord's day in the morning, to examine his &s;cholars concerning the &s;ermons that they had heard the former Lord's day, and to add &s;ome other que&s;tions which might try the under&s;tanding and knowledge of his
<PB N="35" REF="89">&s;cholars. His ma&s;ter was often amazed at this child's an&s;wers, and took an opportunity to go to his mother, to thank her for in&s;tructing her &s;on &s;o well; but &s;he replied, that he improved in his under&s;tanding, not only by her in&s;tructions, but by his own reading and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="7">7. He was a child that was extraordinary inqui|&s;itive, and full of good que&s;tions, and very careful to ob&s;erve and remember what he heard.</P>
<P N="8">8. He had a great hatred of what&s;oever he knew to be di&s;plea&s;ing to God, and he was &s;o greatly concerned for the honour of God, that he would be much di&s;plea&s;ed, if any gro&s;s &s;ins were com|mitted before him. And he had a deep &s;en&s;e of the worth of &s;ouls, and was not a little grieved when he &s;aw any do that which he knew was dangerous to their &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="9">9. One day &s;eeing one of his near relations come into his Father's hou&s;e di&s;tempered with drink, as he thought, he quickly went very &s;eriou&s;ly to him, and wept over him, that he &s;hould &s;o offend God and hazard his &s;oul, and begged of him to &s;pend his time better than in drinking and gaming; and this he did, without any in&s;truction from his pa|rents, but from an inward principle of grace, and love to God and &s;ouls, as it is verily believed.</P>
<P N="10">10. When he was at play with other children, he would be oftentimes putting in &s;ome word to keep them from naughty talk, or wicked actions; and if any did take the Lord's name in vain, or do any thing unbecoming of a good child, they &s;hould &s;oon hear of it from him; nay, once hearing a boy &s;peak very profanely, and that after two or three ad|monitions he would not forbear, nor go out of his company neither, he was &s;o tran&s;ported with
<PB N="36" REF="90">zeal, that he could not forbear falling upon him, to beat him, but his mother chiding of him for it, he &s;aid, that he could not endure to hear the name of God &s;o abu&s;ed by a wretched boy. This is ob&s;erv|ed not to vindicate the act, but to take notice of his zeal.</P>
<P N="11">11. He was a child that took great delight in the company of good men, and e&s;pecially mini&s;ters and &s;cholars; and if he had any lei&s;ure time, he would improve it by vi&s;iting of &s;uch, who&s;e di&s;cour&s;e might make him wi&s;er and better; and when he was in their &s;ociety, to be &s;ure his talk was more like a chri&s;tian and a &s;cholar than a child.</P>
<P N="12">12. One day after &s;chool-time was over, he paid Mr. <HI>Andrew Kent</HI> (one of the mini&s;ters of <HI>Aberdeen</HI>) a vi&s;it, and a&s;ked him &s;everal &s;olid que&s;tions; but the good man a&s;ked him &s;ome que&s;tions out of his catechi&s;m: and finding him not &s;o ready in the an&s;wers as he &s;hould have been, did a little reprove him, and told him, that he mu&s;t be &s;ure to get his catechi&s;m perfectly by heart: the child took the re|proof very well, and went home and &s;et very clo&s;e to his catechi&s;m, and never le&s;t it till he got it by heart; and not only &s;o, but he would be en|quiring into the &s;en&s;e and meaning of it.</P>
<P N="13">13. He was &s;o greatly taken with his catechi&s;m, that he was not content to learn it him&s;elf, but he would be putting others upon learning it al&s;o, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that were neare&s;t to him; he could not be &s;atisfied till he had per&s;uaded the &s;ervants to learn it, and when they were at work, he would be &s;till following them with &s;ome good que&s;tion or other; &s;o that the child &s;eemed to be taken up with the thoughts of his &s;oul, God's ho|nour, and the good of others.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="37" REF="91">14. He was a con&s;cientious ob&s;erver of the Lord's day, &s;pending all the time either in &s;ecret prayer, or reading the &s;criptures, and good books; learning of his catechi&s;m, and hearing of the word of God, and publick duties; and was not only careful in the performance of tho&s;e duties him&s;elf, but was ready to put all that he knew upon a &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day, and was exceedingly grieved at the profanation of it. One Lord's day a &s;ervant of his father's going out of the hou&s;e upon an extra|ordinary occa&s;ion, to fetch &s;omething that was wanted, he took on &s;o bitterly, that he could &s;carce be pacified, becau&s;e that holy day was &s;o abu&s;ed (as he judged) in his father's hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="15">15. When he was between &s;ix and &s;even years old, it plea&s;ed God to afflict him with &s;ore eyes, which was no mall grief to him, becau&s;e it kept him from &s;chool, which he loved as well as many boys do their play; and that which was wor&s;e, he was commanded by the doctor not to read any book what&s;oever at home. But O how was this poor child grieved, that he might not have liberty to read the holy &s;criptures! and for all their charge he would get by him&s;elf, and &s;tand by the window and read the bible and other good books; yea, he was &s;o greedy of reading the &s;criptures, and took &s;o much delight in them, that he would &s;carce allow him&s;elf time to dre&s;s him&s;elf; for reading the word of God was his great delight. Yea, though he had been beat for &s;tudying &s;o much, yet judging it God's command that he &s;hould give him&s;elf up to reading, he could not be beat off from it, till he was &s;o bad that he had like never to have recovered his &s;ight more.</P>
<P N="16">16. It was his practice to be much by him&s;elf in
<PB N="38" REF="92">&s;ecret prayer; and he was careful to manage that work, &s;o as that it might be as &s;ecret as po&s;&s;ibly it could be, but his frequency and con&s;tancy made it to be ea&s;ily ob&s;erved! upon which, one time one having a great mind to know what this &s;weet babe prayed for, got into a place near him, and heard him very earne&s;tly praying for the church of God, de&s;iring that the kingdom of the go&s;pel might be &s;pread over the whole world, and that the kingdom of grace might more and more come into the hearts of God's people, and that the kingdom of glory might be ha&s;tened. He was wont to continue half an hour, &s;ometimes an hour, upon his knees to|gether.</P>
<P N="17">17. He was much above the vanities that mo&s;t children are taken with, and was indeed too much above this world to live long in it.</P>
<P N="18">18. He was very humble and mode&s;t, and did by no means affect finene&s;s in apparel, but hated any|thing more than nece&s;&s;aries either in cloaths or diet.</P>
<P N="19">19. When he perceived either his brother or &s;i&s;|ter plea&s;ed with their new cloaths, he would, with a great deal of gravity, reprove their folly, and when his reproof &s;ignified little, he would bewai their vanity.</P>
<P N="20">20. Once he had a new &s;uit brought him, which, when he looked on, he found &s;ome rib|bons at the knees, at which he was grieved, a&s;k|ing his mother, Whether tho&s;e things would keep him warm? No, child, &s;aid his mother: Why then &s;aid he, do you &s;uffer them to be put here? you are mi&s;taken, if you think &s;uch things plea&s;e me: and, I doubt, &s;ome that are better than us, may wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the money that this co&s;t you, to buy them bread.</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="39" REF="93">21. He would intreat his mother to have a care of gratifying a proud humour in his brother and E&s;ters, he did tell them of the danger of pride, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow little rea&s;on they had to be proud of that which was their &s;hame: for, &s;aid he, if it had not been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or &s;in, we &s;hould have had no need of cloaths.</P>
<P N="22">22. At lei&s;ure times he would be talking to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chool-fellows about the things of God, and urge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he nece&s;&s;ity of a holy life.

<P N="23">23. After this his parents removed not far from <HI>London,</HI> where he continued till that dreadful year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ixty-five; he was then &s;ent to the <HI>Latin</HI> &s;chool, where he &s;oon made a very con&s;iderable progre&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd was greatly beloved of his ma&s;ter; the &s;chool was his beloved place, and learning his recreation. He was never taught to write, but took it of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn ingenuity.</P>
<P N="24">24. He was exceeding dutiful to his parents, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever did in the lea&s;t di&s;pute their commands, except when he thought they might cro&s;s the com|mand of God) as in the forementioned bu&s;ine&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eading the &s;criptures when his eyes were &s;o bad.</P>
<P N="25">25. He was exceedingly contented with any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ean diet, and to be &s;ure he would not touch a bit
<PB N="40" REF="94">of any thing till he had begged God's Ble&s;&s;ing upon it.</P>
<P N="26">26. He would put his brother and &s;i&s;ter upon their duties, and ob&s;erved them whether they per|formed them or no, and when he &s;aw any neglect, he would &s;oon warn them; if he &s;aw any of them take a &s;poon into their hands before he had craved a ble&s;&s;ing, he &s;aid, that is ju&s;t like a hog indeed.</P>
<P N="27">27. His &s;i&s;ter was afraid of the darkne&s;s, and would &s;ometimes cry upon this account; he told her &s;he mu&s;t fear God more, and &s;he need then be afraid of nothing.</P>
<P N="28">28. He would humbly put his near relations upon their duty, and minding the concerns of their &s;ouls and eternity, with more &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and life, and to have a care of doing that which was for the di&s;ho|nour of God, and the hazard of the &s;oul.</P>
<P N="29">29. He was of a compa&s;&s;ionate and charitable di&s;po&s;ition, and very pitiful to the poor, or any tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were in di&s;tre&s;s, but his greate&s;t pity was to poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ouls; and as well as he could he would be putting children, play-fellows, &s;ervants, and neighbours upon minding their precious &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="30">30. One notable in&s;tance of his true charity, I cannot omit. A certain Turk was by the provi|dence of God ca&s;t into the place where he lived which this &s;weet child hearing of, had a great pity to his &s;oul, and &s;tudied how he might be any way in&s;trumental to do it good; at la&s;t finding a man tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> under&s;tood the language of the Turk, he u&s;ed mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to get them together, which he at la&s;t procured; the fir&s;t thing that he did, was to put his friend upon di&s;cour&s;ing with the Turk about his principles, whe|ther he acknowledged a Deity, which the Turk owning; the next thing he enquired was, Wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he thought of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? at which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P N="31">31. He would have a &s;avoury word to &s;ay to very one that he conver&s;ed with, to put them in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind of the worth of Chri&s;t, and their &s;ouls; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir nearne&s;s to eternity. In&s;omuch that good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eople took no &s;mall plea&s;ure in his company.

<P N="32">32. He bewailed the mi&s;erable condition of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nerality of mankind (when he was about ten years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d) that were utterly e&s;tranged from God, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ey called him father, yet they were his children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly by creation, and not by any likene&s;s they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God, or intere&s;t in him.</P>
<P N="33">33. Thus he continued walking in the ways of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od, ingaged in reading, praying, hearing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ord of God, and &s;piritual di&s;cour&s;e, di&s;covering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ereby his &s;erious thoughts of eternity.</P>
<P N="34">34. He had an earne&s;t de&s;ire, if it might be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ord's good plea&s;ure, to give him&s;elf up to the

<P N="36">36.
