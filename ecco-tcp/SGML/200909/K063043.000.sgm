<LG>
<L>WHEN a melodious lark, a&s;cending, &s;ings,</L>
<L>The wide expan&s;e with &s;hrilly echoes rings;</L>
<L>'Till, &s;trongly winging his aerial way,</L>
<L>To &s;ight he's lo&s;t, warbling his heav'n-tun'd lay!</L>
<L>Not &s;o, when the young bird fir&s;t 'ttempts a flight,</L>
<L>Emerging from his ne&s;t to dazzling light&mdash;</L>
<L>With flutt'ring pinions, half-form'd notes, dim'd eyes,</L>
<L>From the too pow'rful glare, he, trembling, hies</L>
<L>To &s;ome thick wood, low cop&s;e, or &s;hady grove,</L>
<L>Where he, &s;ecure from birds of prey, may rove;</L>
<L>Where &s;afely he may try his feeble wings,</L>
<L>There flits from &s;pray to &s;pray, and faintly &s;ings:</L>
<L>Patient remains 'till &s;trength and art are won,</L>
<L>Then &s;oars and warbles 'gain&s;t the noon-day &s;un!</L>
<L>But, when he ventures fir&s;t t'explore the &s;ky,</L>
<L>Should critic-buzzard, hawk, or kite be nigh,</L>
<L>Skimming and winding round, then on him dart,</L>
<L>His beak and talons dig into his heart;</L>
<L>No more he &s;ings, no more can ever fly,</L>
<L>His artle&s;s &s;ong and &s;elf together die!</L>
<L>So will it fare with our green-bird or &s;parrow,</L>
<L>If, grov'ling found, you o'er him draw the harrow;</L>
<L>No more he'll chirrup his in&s;ipid note,</L>
<L>Or vainly gurgle his di&s;cordant throat:</L>
<L>O lo&s;s of lo&s;&s;es!&mdash;ne'er to be recover'd&mdash;</L>
<L>A green-bird in a furrow you have &s;mother'd!</L>
<L>But &s;ay you're merciful, and, '&s;tead of killing</L>
<L>The vent'rous fool, to rear him &s;hould be willing;</L>
<L>Pleas'd, he'll crack rape-&s;eed, bucket rai&s;e of water,</L>
<L>T' amu&s;e your&s;elf, &s;pou&s;e, &s;on, and pretty daughter;</L>
<L>And while he grun&s;ell picks, or chickweed eats,</L>
<L>Will, chirping, thank each gen'rous heart that treats;</L>
<L>May learn the linnet's, lark's, canary's &s;ong,</L>
<L>His tuneful life if kindly you prolong;</L>

<P>HERE, madam, if you plea&s;e, we'll con|clude the labour of the day.</P>

<P>Call it rather the plea&s;ure of the day, &s;ir,&mdash;for &s;uch it is to me, I a&s;&s;ure you&mdash;to you indeed, &s;ir, I fear it mu&s;t be otherwi&s;e&mdash;the in&s;truction of a &s;illy girl, no doubt, is painful and tedious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, madam, I did not call it labour in that &s;en&s;e; &s;o far am I from think|ing it irk&s;ome, the hours I pa&s;s in this our every morning's exerci&s;e, and the duties of my holy function, are the happie&s;t of my life:&mdash;for, believe me, were you my own child, in&s;tead of my honour'd patron's, I could not love you better!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor do I think Sir Thomas's affection (altho' the be&s;t of fathers) exceeds the very pa|ternal regard you have ever been plea&s;ed to expre&s;s for me&mdash;and&mdash;I know not why&mdash;I
<PB N="2" REF="10">think I feel not a more filial love for him, than for your&s;elf, &s;ir!</P>

<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear madam, &s;ay not &s;o:&mdash;the many hours we pa&s;s together in our delightful &s;tudies, beget in you a cu&s;tomary regard&mdash; think it no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps it is no more, &s;ir, nay, it cannot&mdash;for never had a child a kinder parent!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor ever had a man a truer friend! Indeed, &s;o general is his goodne&s;s, he might be a pattern for mankind:&mdash;he never &s;aw an infant without a parent's fondne&s;s, or a grey head, but, like a child, he honour'd it!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha! what, hard at it?&mdash;What is it?&mdash;Ethics or mathematics, a&s;trology or the|ology?&mdash;'tis a thou&s;and pities, Doctor, your pupil is a girl, otherwi&s;e &s;he would certainly be a bi&s;hop in time.</P>

<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not, papa;&mdash;you &s;ee Dr. Goodman, with as much piety, learning, good &s;en&s;e, and, I am &s;ure, as good a heart as any, has hitherto attained to no greater dignities than rector of this pari&s;h, your chaplain, &s;ir, and my tutor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were I, madam, what you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay of me, it does not at all follow I &s;hould ever be &s;o exalted.&mdash;There are, no doubt, an infinitely greater number of de&s;erving mini&s;ters than there are mitres, or even inferior dignities; but whoever has attained to that of an hone&s;t man, will feel, that church or &s;tate can never rai&s;e him higher!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think &s;o too, Doctor; and, in that re&s;pect, there is not a more exalted character than your&s;elf.</P>

<P>Heaven forbid, &s;ir!</P>

<P>But all this while I forget your boy, Doctor.&mdash;I made my morning's airing &s;horter than u&s;ual, that I might be in the way when he arrived.&mdash;He is not come yet, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>

<P>Does young Mr. Goodman come home from Oxford to day, &s;ir?</P>

<P>Ble&s;s me! I thought he was not to have come till next week, &s;ir.</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, yes, he'll be here to day, and then you may have a new tutor, for I &s;uppo&s;e you have almo&s;t tir'd your old one.&mdash;I war|rant, by this time, he can &s;peak Greek as well as his father; what think you, Doctor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>I not only think that of him, &s;ir, but, were he not my own, I could be bold to &s;ay, he is the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed youth I ever &s;aw, and, add to that&mdash;the be&s;t!</P>

<P>Ay, ay, George is a good boy!&mdash; ay, and a clever one too&mdash;every body &s;ays &s;o as well as your&s;elf:&mdash;but if they did not, the crow, you know, always thinks her own young white&s;t, ha, ha, ha!&mdash;Let me &s;ee,

<P>Od! I wish he was come! I have not &s;een him this age:&mdash;and are not you glad he is coming, Emily?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, &s;ir, very glad&mdash;for I think him a mo&s;t amiable young man; and
<PB N="4" REF="12">have often thought it a thou&s;and pities he is not heir to a good fortune; as this idolatrous world of ours, &s;till worshipping a golden calf, would value him much more for inheriting a fund of wealth than virtues:&mdash;and a rich cox|comb is oftner propo&s;ed to us poor girls, than the mo&s;t de&s;erving of our affections, who&s;e me|rits are not back'd with that powerful recom|mendation&mdash;a great e&s;tate!</P>

<P>It's very true, my dear,&mdash;too often the ca&s;e, I mu&s;t confe&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I make no doubt, but even our ridiculous worthle&s;s neighbour, Lord Sealand's addre&s;&s;es, would be e&s;teemed an honour, and plain George Goodman's, an affront, to mo&s;t great families in the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he is a peer of the realm, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, papa; and there are very few &s;o ill-bred, as to think a coronet may &s;ometimes cover a weak head, or a glittering &s;tar, a bad heart!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha! well &s;aid, my little &s;ati|ri&s;t!&mdash;We are to be honour'd with his lord|ship's company to day at dinner, on purpo&s;e to &s;ee George.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>His lordship has been always kind enough to take great notice of my poor boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the only proof of under&s;tand|ing he ever gave&mdash;and, but for that, he would be intolerable, with his unaccountable whims and caprices.&mdash;Now own, papa, don't you think it a &s;trange amu&s;ement he has lately taken to, keeping &s;ailing ve&s;&s;els, to be &s;o often to&s;&s;ing about on the &s;ea as he is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="13">
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why ay, child, I think it rather too boi&s;terous to be called plea&s;ure; but he &s;eldom makes a much longer trip than ju&s;t acro&s;s to Calais, to furnish him&s;elf with &s;ome of their knicknacks and fopperies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, papa; for &s;uch a finical wa|terfly is he, that, when on shore, he lays out more money in powder and perfumes in a week, than, I fear, he gives to the poor in a year.&mdash;I never &s;ee him, papa, but I think of beau Mizen in the play. Ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Thom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, Emily, my dear, you, of all people in the world, should not be &s;o &s;evere upon him: he's a very warm admirer of you, you know; and has almo&s;t a&s;k'd my con|&s;ent to marry you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is not a bit more in my good graces for that, I a&s;&s;ure you, papa; for, could he obtain your con&s;ent, I believe he'd care very little whether he had mine or not.</P>

I began to be a little queer with my lord about it; for the &s;weet cratur look'd as innocent as a &s;ucking dove, ay, or a new-born dove's egg! and I determin'd not to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t at making her otherwi&s;e!</P>
