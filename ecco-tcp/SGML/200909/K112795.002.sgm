<P>Ye&s;terday the Committee of Enquiry on the Gho&s;t in Cock-Lane, met at the Jeru&s;alem Tavern in Clerkenwell; when Mi&s;s P. was put to bed by one of the maids of honour, in the room where

<P>The <HI>knockings</HI> and <HI>&s;cratchings</HI> began about midnight, and the examination was in the following manner:</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Will you go into that pint bottle? <HI>(point|ing to a pint bottle that &s;tood on the table.)</HI>&mdash;One knock.</P>

<HEAD>To the PRINTER of the ST. JAMES's CHRONICLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day, May 20, 1762.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>Mr. Baldwin,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR true-born Engli&s;hmen, your bold Bri|tons, who are lions in the field, and &s;ea lions on the ocean, are, with all their courage, the mo&s;t remarkable of any nation in the world, for being &s;eized with a Panick. A battle lo&s;t, or an i&s;land taken, brings down their high &s;pirits in an in&s;tant, and the nation is undone. An eclip&s;e, or a comet with the help of &s;ome profound philo&s;opher in the magazines, or two or three terrifying paragraphs in the News-papers, &s;hall fill the imagination of all the old women, of both &s;exes, with horrible ap|prehen&s;ions of the immediate de&s;truction of the world; and groaning pro&s;elytes pour in, without number, to Tottenham-Court and Moorfields. It is &s;till fre&s;h in our memories, that two &s;light &s;hocks of an earthquake, the mo&s;t violent of which never &s;hook the pewter off the kitchen-&s;helves in Gro&s;venor-Square, turned the minds of the bold Britons top&s;y-turvy, and all London it&s;elf &s;eemed going out of town. In &s;hort, the &s;pirits ri&s;e and fall, in the barometer of Engli&s;h imaginations, with mo&s;t incredible revolutions.
<PB N="8" REF="14">
Their hopes, unle&s;s perpetually buoyed up by pro&s;perous circum&s;tances, are &s;ure to &s;ink. Publick Opinions are as delicate as Publick Credit; and it &s;eems as impo&s;&s;ible for Engli&s;hmen to pre&s;erve a man|ly evenne&s;s of temper, as to keep the &s;tocks at <HI>par.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e reflections occurred on ob&s;erving the terror, that has diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through mo&s;t fa|milies, on account of the pre&s;ent Epidemical Di&s;|temper; for &s;o, Mr. Baldwin, you, and the re&s;t of your brother new&s;mongers, have taught us to call it. They, into who&s;e hands our journals may fall in foreign countries, mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that a plague is raging among&s;t us. The bills of mortality, &s;ay they, are con&s;iderably &s;welled in their number; ten are buried in one grave: four or five in a family are carried off in one day; with other particulars, which every body believes though nobody knows to be true. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that there mu&s;t be &s;ome noxious qua|lity in the air, and pieces of beef are &s;ent up from Highgate Hill, at the tail of &s;chool-boys kites; though it is the received doctrine of writers on all plagues, that any pe&s;tilential quality in the air affects dogs, hor&s;es, and other animals, before it reaches men, and would con&s;equently &s;hew it&s;elf on the live ox, as well as the dead piece of beef. For my part, as a true Briton, I cannot help being
<PB N="9" REF="15">
mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly offended, that Beef, the &s;taple food of old England, Beef, the glory of our country, &s;hould be pro&s;tituted to &s;uch purpo&s;es. In a time of war, when provi&s;ions of all kinds grow dearer and dearer every day, when the price is artfully rai&s;ed on meat, and fi&s;h is obliged to be brought to town in the machine of Arts and Sciences, I am alarmed, le&s;t this prodigality &s;hould be the means, or at lea&s;t &s;erve the butchers as a pretence, for rai&s;ing the price of meat &s;till higher; and my ap|prehen&s;ions are redoubled, when my maid a&s;&s;ures me, on coming from market, that broth being uni|ver&s;ally pre&s;cribed in the pre&s;ent reigning di&s;order, &s;craigs of mutton are grown &s;o much in reque&s;t, that the wor&s;t end &s;ells for &s;ix-pence and &s;even-pence <HI>per</HI> pound.</P>
<P>In the mean time, to keep our terrors alive, and to prevent the Panick from &s;ub&s;iding in the minds of the people, all the Doctors who are authors, begin to tell us from the pre&s;s, that colds caught at this &s;ea&s;on are extremely dangerous; and all the book&s;ellers who are venders of the medicines, recommend their no&s;trums by fifty different arti|fices, in&s;erted in adverti&s;ements, letters, para|graphs, &amp;c.&mdash;And here, Mr. Baldwin, I cannot but ob&s;erve by the bye what you, who are a prin|ter,
<PB N="10" REF="16">
mu&s;t often have ob&s;erved your&s;elf, and know to be true, that the connection between author and book&s;eller, is as in&s;eparable as that between whore and bawd, a ju&s;tice and his clerk, a coun&s;ellor and attorney, or (according to Congreve) a curate and a tobacco-&s;topper;&mdash;that this connection, I &s;ay, has of late years, begun to di&s;play it&s;elf in a new light: for &s;ince the doctors have pretty gene|rally become authors, book&s;ellers and printers have acted as a kind of ba&s;tard &s;pecies of apothecaries. In the natural cour&s;e of trade and &s;hop-keeping, one would as &s;oon think of &s;ending for a pot of porter to the grocer's, or a leg of mutton to the tallow-chandler's, as for a pill, drop, or an electu|ary, to the printing-office; or for a powder, a bal&s;am, or an elixir, to the book&s;eller's. Yet &s;o it is, medicines and pamphlets are prepared and written by one and the &s;ame hand, and both <HI>pub|li&s;hed</HI> (for that I find is the phra&s;e in each ca&s;e) at one and the &s;ame &s;hop. Two &s;uch ranks of men in combination, who are each of them perpetually addre&s;&s;ing the publick, have opportunities, like mountebank-practi&s;ers, to hawk their own me|dicines. It is their intere&s;t in the fir&s;t place, to per&s;uade you that you are &s;ick, or that you will be &s;ick; and in the next place, to per&s;uade you
<PB N="11" REF="17">
that nothing but their <HI>no&s;trum</HI> will in&s;ure your re|covery, or prevent your taking the di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Now, Mr. Baldwin, having my&s;elf a new di&s;|covery in medicine to recommend to the publick, a preparation that will be of the mo&s;t infinite &s;ervice in the pre&s;ent reigning di&s;temper, and in all other di&s;tem|pers that ever have affected, or ever will, or can affect human nature, I beg leave to make it known to the world through the channel of your mo&s;t u&s;eful, mo&s;t excellent, mo&s;t entertaining, mo&s;t in&s;tructive, paper. Tho&s;e, you know, are the phra&s;es which the corre&s;pondents of all publick journals, from your own down to the Farthing Po&s;t, when there was one, have always made u&s;e of. I cannot boa&s;t a patent for my medicine. But as I &s;hall plainly appear to have only the publick good at heart, by declaring its virtues in your Chronicle, I will an&s;wer for it that the Stamp-Office &s;hall demand no duty, as for an adverti&s;ement, though you in&s;ert it ever &s;o often.</P>

<P>A gentleman who had long been complaining and complaining, and ailing and ailing, and who had taken all the medicines in and out of the di&s;|pen&s;atory, at length applied to the celebrated Doc|tor
<PB N="13" REF="19">
for Radcliffe. The Doctor &s;oon perceiving the na|ture of his ca&s;e, told him, that he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ecret, which was infallible for his di&s;temper; but that unluckily it was at that time in the hands of Doctor Pitcairne at Edinburgh, to whom he would write to apply it in favour of the patient, if he him&s;elf thought it worth while to go &s;o far in que&s;t of it. The patient readily undertook the journey, and travelled to Edinburgh: but when he arrived there, he had the mortification to find that ju&s;t before Doctor Radcliffe's letter reached Edinburgh, Doctor Pitcairne had &s;ent them edicine to Doctor Mu&s;grave of Exeter. The patient how|ever had re&s;olution enough on Doctor Pitcairne's advice, to go acro&s;s the country to Exeter, in fur|ther pur&s;uit of it: but as ill luck would have it, Doctor Mu&s;grave told him, that he had, but the day before, tran&s;mitted it back again to Doctor Radcliffe in London, where the patient naturally returned, to take the benefit of it at home. He could not help laughing with the Doctor at the tour he had taken, and at his &s;trange di&s;appointments. I went after the medicine, &s;aid the patient, to no purpo&s;e; and yet I cannot tell how it happens, but I am much better than I was when I &s;at out. I know it, cries the Doctor, I know it. You have
<PB N="14" REF="20">
got the medicine. The journey was the &s;ecret. And do but live <HI>temperately</HI> and keep your&s;elf in Exerci&s;e, you will have no occa&s;ion for any phy&s;ick in the world.</P>

<P>AND &s;o, Mr. Baldwin, nothing but Politicks will go down with you at pre&s;ent! Your old corre&s;pondents, the Laughers and the Jokers, and the Wits and the Criticks, and the Poets, are all va|ni&s;hed; and in come the Patriots, and the State&s;|men, the Advocates of Liberty, and the Quellers of Sedition. Not a man but writes as if his country was at &s;take; not a pen that is not drawn, as it were, <HI>pro aris &amp; focis</HI>; not a drop of ink, that is not &s;hed in the cau&s;e of Liberty, Property, and Religion. Party has divided the whole town, and <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con</HI> takes up every page of your Chronicle.&mdash;You call
<PB N="15" REF="21">
your&s;elf impartial, that is, you give both parties a fair opportunity to abu&s;e each other. <HI>Audi alteram partem,</HI> is your maxim; that is (in your free tran&s;|lation) <HI>Hear both &s;ides</HI>! and indeed they are well worth hearing, and what infinite delight mu&s;t a Scotchman receive, after reading a certain portion of abu&s;e on his country and countrymen, how charmingly mu&s;t his indignation be &s;oothed and appea&s;ed, to find his opponents equally be&s;pattered in the next column! But as this kind of impar|tiality abu&s;es all parties, the con&s;equence is that all parties abu&s;e you, and each in their turn con&s;ider you as the tool of their adver&s;aries. La&s;t week, in a coffee-hou&s;e near St. James's, I &s;aw a Scotch Colonel, who longs for the next regiment that falls, throw your paper into the fire, provoked by the &s;everity of a letter again&s;t Lord Bute; and the very next morning I &s;aw the &s;ame paper almo&s;t as hardly dealt with in the Alley, on account of an extract from the Auditor, which reflected on the brokers and Mr. Pitt. Let me tell you, Mr. Baldwin, it is very lucky that you are not obliged to follow your paper, wherever it goes; and that your figure is not as univer&s;ally known as the face of your paper. I knew a country printer that ventured to in&s;ert letters on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion in his journal,
<PB N="16" REF="22">
during the county election: and I can a&s;&s;ure you, Mr. Baldwin, that though he was one of the lu&s;|tie&s;t men in that country, and above &s;ix feet high, he could &s;carce put his head out of doors in the cour&s;e of the whole controver&s;y. You, I am told, are a tight built little black man, but by no means &s;uch an able-bodied printer as my friend in the country. If you cannot weild th&eacute; quarter-&s;taff of party with ea&s;e, and have not power fairly to cudgel your enemies into good humour, believe me, Sir, 'tis dangerous to hobble along on the unequal and un|&s;teady crutches of two oppo&s;ite factions. Your fugitive &s;cribblers are unknown, and leave you to &s;tand buff to the Publick for their labours. On the contrary, the authors of the &s;everal political papers now extant, keep the names of their prin|ters as &s;ecret as tho&s;e of their &s;urgeons: and as to them&s;elves, they are a match for any thing. The club of the Monitor, is, I am told, more formida|ble than his pen; the Briton, they &s;ay, is a raw|boned Scot&s;man; the Auditor a tall Iri&s;hman; and the North Briton, or the world hugely belies him, has a broader pair of &s;houlders than any author militant in this great metropolis.</P>
<P>After all, Mr. Baldwin, I believe you are a mighty good &s;ort of man, and mean no harm. If
<PB N="17" REF="23">
the people of this town will write nothing but Politicks, and read nothing but Politicks, you are reduced of nece&s;&s;ity to print nothing but Politicks: becau&s;e your &s;tationer mu&s;t be paid, your hawkers mu&s;t be fee'd, nay you mu&s;t give your very devil his due, and have an hot joint every day and a pud|ding on Sunday. Yet cannot I forbear admiring the publick &s;pirit of our authors; who while, their all is at &s;take, while the very nature of literary property is in que&s;tion, neglecting to refute the &s;trange and unnatural doctrine, that <Q REND="inline">"an author has no right to his own work,"</Q> are all up in arms on another occa&s;ion, &s;ettling the Mini&s;try and agitating the Preliminaries of Peace. For my own part, though I have been equally &s;ollicited by both parties, and though you are ready to in&s;ert my arguments on either &s;ide of the que&s;tion, yet I am re&s;olved, like Scrub, to &s;ay nothing, <HI>Pro</HI> nor <HI>Con,</HI> till we have a Peace.&mdash;In the mean time as no|thing but Politicks will go down, to comply in &s;ome mea&s;ure with the humour of the town, &s;up|po&s;e I oblige you and your readers, with a critical review of our political writers. I do not mean to give a weekly detail of their arguments, to &s;cru|tinize their characters, or critici&s;e particular parts of their productions. Heaven forbid!&mdash;all I
<PB N="18" REF="24">
intend is to draw their general characters; and per|haps, if I happen to be in the right vein for &s;uch a whim, to give a &s;hort &s;ketch of the &s;tyle and manner of each of them. And &s;o, Ma&s;ter Bald|win till you hear from me again I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE NORTH BRITON EXRTAORDINARY,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><DATE>June 4, 1762.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>AN extraordinary circum&s;tance is a &s;uffi|cient apology for a paper extraordinary. The date of this e&s;&s;ay will immediately denote the &s;ubject of
<PB N="19" REF="25">
it, and &s;hew that I mean to congratulate the Pub|lick in general, and my countrymen in particular, on the occa&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's Birth-day. The North-Briton is not one of tho&s;e low &s;cribblers, who like that &s;lave the Briton, or that pro&s;titute the Auditor, mean to write them&s;elves into a place or a pen&s;ion; nor will he be re&s;trained from deliver|ing his &s;entiments by the fear of fire, pillory, or impri&s;onment. The Law &s;hall be his protection; and while Lord Mansfield &s;hall pre&s;ide as Lord Chief Ju&s;tice in the Court of King's Bench, the North Briton &s;hall dread no oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, as well as on every other, I &s;hall &s;tudy to &s;peak out. I have not been u&s;ed to be a re&s;pecter of per&s;ons. I do not, after the manner of the old patriots in the Craft&s;man, make u&s;e of nick-names. The ingenious devices of Lord Gawkee, Colonel Catiline, and Colonel Squintum, Lord Gotham&s;tow, Captain Iago Anni|&s;eed, and Par&s;on Bruin, and Par&s;on Brawn, I leave to the Briton and Auditor. I u&s;e no a&s;te|ri&s;ks; the names of Dukes, and Lords, and Mini|&s;ters, are written at full length, for I am above all eva&s;ion. Wherefore, without further preface or preamble, I gladly &s;eize the opportunity of this great anniver&s;ary, to congratulate tho&s;e of our
<PB N="20" REF="26">
inclining, that we have now a Prince upon the throne, who is an ab&s;olute Jacobite.</P>
<P>However paradoxical &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion may appear, I have no doubt of being able to demon|&s;trate it as clearly as any propo&s;ition in Euclid. <HI>Imprimis,</HI> the groundwork and fir&s;t principle of Jacobiti&s;m, is to cheri&s;h the warme&s;t &s;entiments for the family of Stuart. Lord Bute (I dare venture to a&s;&s;ert it) is of the Stuart family. He is him&s;elf a Stuart. He cannot deny it. It is a circum&s;tance which mini&s;terial advocates may palliate, but which, like that of his being a true Scot, they cannot di&s;&s;emble. Yet, Scot and Stuart as he is, we have &s;een him Secretary of State, and we now &s;ee him at the head of the Trea&s;ury: I &s;ay, we &s;ee a Scot&s;man (the reader may recollect I have written a whole paper on this &s;ubject) at the head of the Trea&s;ury. There is a pa&s;&s;age in Archbi&s;hop Spot&s;wood, p. 180 by which it appears, that during the troubles of that condemned Stuart, Charles I. there was at one time in his Maje&s;ty's Trea&s;ury, the immen&s;e &s;um of &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence.&mdash;A &s;um that might almo&s;t rival the contents of the Bank of Edinburgh, which &s;ometimes di&s;counts bills to nearly that amount Yet Lord Bute is at the head of a trea&s;ury, drawing &s;chemes to rai&s;e at one time
<PB N="21" REF="27">
millions of Engli&s;h pounds (I might &s;ay hundreds of millions, did I mean Scotch pounds) double the number of the above &s;hillings. How then can we doubt his Maje&s;ty's attachment to the family of Stuart? Demo&s;thenes &s;aid of the Pythian oracle, that it Philipi&s;ed: we do not want an En|gli&s;h Demo&s;thenes, who might &s;ay, that his Maje&s;ty Stuarti&s;eth, that is, being interpreted, He is a Jacobite.</P>
<P>To prove this &s;till further, let us con&s;ider, that during the two former reigns of the pre&s;ent family, every Scot&s;man was kept at as great a di|&s;tance from court, as Edinburgh is from London; and all country-gentlemen (commonly called To|ries) were doomed to remain for ever in the coun|try, never receiving the lea&s;t encouragement to come to St. James's. How is all this rever&s;ed at pre&s;ent? It is held no crime to be born on the other &s;ide of the Tweed; nay, the immen&s;e &s;um of four thou&s;and pounds is allowed by parliament towards building a bridge over that &s;tream, to facilitate the communication between the two united king|doms, or rather to pave the way for Scot&s;men to come over into England. And here I would hum|bly &s;ubmit to the commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed by the legi&s;lature, that the bridge may contain only a
<PB N="22" REF="28">
foot-way! for alas! we too well know that their maxim is, <HI>Ve&s;tigia nulla retror&s;um</HI>; and when they have once walked hither, not one of them will drive their carriages back again. <HI>Had Cain been Scot, &amp;c.</HI> The pa&s;&s;age is as well known as any in Fingal, or John Hume's tragedies. Add to all this, that known Tories, men, who during the &s;everal loyal admini&s;trations, were marked for Jacobites, whom Kings were taught to call &s;o, are now daily &s;een at St. James's. The rage of party hath entirely &s;ub&s;ided: places of power and profit are be&s;towed on gentlemen of Oxford&s;hire, and members of the Cocoa-tree. The Univer&s;ity of Oxford it&s;elf, which was declared in the Hou&s;e of Commons <Q REND="inline">"to be paved with Di&s;affection and Jacobiti&s;m,"</Q> begins to receive encouragement; their addre&s;&s;es engage attention, and we hear of Oxford Bi&s;hops and Prebendaries: in a word, how could all the&s;e things be? How could it come to pa&s;s, unle&s;s his Maje&s;ty were a Jacobite, that Tories &s;hould be in place; that Lord Bute &s;hould have power; that knights of the Thi&s;tle &s;hould be created knights of the Garter; and Scot&s;men be &s;een in broad-cloth and breeches?</P>
<P>The Pretender is now &s;aid to be at Avignon. Now in ca&s;e we &s;hould &s;end an emba&s;&s;ador extraor|dinary

<P>NOTHING was ever more evident, than the pre&s;ent partiality to Scot&s;men. To enu|merate all the particulars of it would be endle&s;s. I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to one &s;ingle in&s;tance. You were one of the fir&s;t to cry out again&s;t the mini|&s;try

<P>I Have been in much pain on your account &s;ince the publication of the NORTH BRITON EXTRA|ORDINARY, which I enclo&s;ed to you in my la&s;t. I was at fir&s;t very glad to find that no|body que&s;tioned its authenticity, but &s;oon began to tremble for its con&s;equences. Some &s;aid that the me&s;&s;engers had &s;ei&s;ed you, your compo|&s;itors, pre&s;s-men, devils, &amp;c. Some foretold mo|tions in the King's-Bench provoking vengeance and letting all the terrors of the law loo&s;e upon you.

<P>IT is a di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance to be &s;tationed on guard, like the out-po&s;ts of an army, ju&s;t on the confines of the enemy's camp. Yet are there &s;ome con&s;iderable advantages re&s;ulting from &s;uch a &s;ituation: for in &s;uch a &s;ituation the earlie&s;t intelligence may be obtained, and while <Q REND="inline">"the hum of either army &s;tilly &s;ounds,"</Q> anecdotes of the mo&s;t curious nature may be collected, as hath already more than once been experienced and manife&s;ted by the Auditor. Nor can I think that the perform|ing this kind of duty is, in the phra&s;e of Bobadil, <HI>&s;ervice of danger</HI>; as it is well known, my an|tagoni&s;t, fierce and furious as he is, can take the
<PB N="27" REF="33">
field, and come even within pi&s;tol &s;hot of his ad|ver&s;ary, without the lea&s;t ill con&s;equence to one party or the other.</P>
<P>For my own part, I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a &s;o|vereign contempt for him, or, if you plea&s;e, them, be he or they of the &s;ingular, plural, or (according to the Grecians) of the dual number, that it is not without the utmo&s;t di&s;dain, that I thus de&s;cend, into the <HI>Arena,</HI> with &s;uch paltry opponents. The late Mr. Fielding, of humourous memory, in one of his Covent-Garden Journals (though I do not know whether that paper be extant in the elegant edition of his works, lately publi&s;hed by Arthur Murphy, E&s;q.) hath I remember, comically proved, that the mo&s;t contemptuous animal in the creation is a <HI>Lou&s;e</HI>; and has de&s;cribed one of tho&s;e animalcules overflowing with a true quality-con|tempt of the mean creature, who&s;e head he inha|bited.</P>
<P>I am, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, <HI>the Lou&s;e</HI> to the <HI>North Briton.</HI> I &s;it weekly in judgement on his head; on the produce whereof he perhaps may live, but I cannot: for the deplorable &s;terility of that &s;pot feeds nothing but my <HI>contempt.</HI> I run over the bar|ren region, more barren than the country he con|tinually reviles, with all the avidity of the little
<PB N="28" REF="34">
human blood-&s;ucker. Here, perhaps, I di&s;cover an abortive vein of Pro&s;aick Poetry; there branches out many a Ramification of Political Vi|rulence; and there, in a remote corner of the <HI>Pia Mater,</HI> is lodged a &s;mall portion of Bayes's Spirit of Brains, which (like the Spirit of Laws) would require the pen of a Monte&s;quieu to de&s;cribe its qualities at large, but it is in fact no other than the Spirit of Dulne&s;s, which &s;erves <Q REND="inline">"the lively dunce"</Q> in&s;tead of Wit and Humour, and produces that airy nothingne&s;s, that vivacious &s;tupidity, &s;o evident in all his publications.</P>
<P>It hath, however, been di&s;covered by micro&s;co|pical ob&s;ervers, that a Lou&s;e is a very lou&s;y animal; in con&s;equence whereof, while I am thus banquet|ing on the North Briton, &s;undry le&s;&s;er lice are preying upon me. The engineers of Grub-&s;treet, to change the allu&s;ion, like the garretteers in the ingenious new print of the ingenious Mr. Hogarth, are daily &s;quirting upon me: to all the&s;e, as well as to the Arch-Enemy, I oppo&s;e nothing but <HI>Con|tempt.</HI> I indulge my&s;elf in a warrantable pride, and the virtuous con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my own &s;uperi|ority. I exert all my adroitne&s;s and dexterity to turn their own arms again&s;t them, and they have at length in&s;tructed me, as Charles the Twelfth did
<PB N="29" REF="35">
the Ru&s;&s;ians, to be their conqueror. Complaining eternally of the lamentable dulne&s;s and &s;currility of factious &s;cribblers, I &s;top the tide of political &s;lander, and open afterwards at plea&s;ure the &s;ources for my own u&s;e and benefit. I &s;ilence with a tone of authority, the clamours of the malcontent again&s;t a noble Lord and his coadjutors in employment; and then I immediately rai&s;e my voice to its highe&s;t pitch, and cry out lu&s;tily again&s;t the Grand Pen|&s;ioner and Lord Gawkee. I reprobate the bold practice of licentiou&s;ly printing names at full length, without &s;o much as mode&s;tly embowelling, or rather <HI>emvowelling</HI> them, or plea&s;antly holding their own|ers in greater deri&s;ion, by a contemptuous altera|tion of them; after which doctrine, the next pa|ragraph in my Ayle&s;bury Journal, recites the names of Wilkes and Churchill, and &s;everal others with|out the lea&s;t di&s;gui&s;e, while poor Hodges and Beardmore, and Charles Say, run glibly into almo&s;t every &s;entence.</P>
<P>Contempt then, &s;overeign contempt, is plainly the be&s;t weapon, offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive, in the hands of a writer of controver&s;y. And what ob|jects can be more worthy to excite that pa&s;&s;ion, than tho&s;e on which I have exerci&s;ed my own?
<PB N="30" REF="36">
What is Lord Gawkee? that noun-adjective Lord, joining his fal&s;e con&s;equence, like an idle epithet, to that proud &s;ub&s;tantive, the Grand Pen&s;ioner? His Temple of Worthies, the collection of Wor|thies of Stowe-Temple, is not, I am told, yet complete. Let him fill the vacant niches with his friends! Let him put up his own bu&s;t! and by way of &s;upporters, let him place Colonel Catiline on one hand, and his Reverend Co-adjutor on the other! What is the Grand Pen&s;ioner? that &s;old &s;lave for ever bellowing about liberty; that hireling who receives his regular wages, without doing the &s;ervice for which he is paid. I may perhaps &s;ome time or other, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Cocker's Arithmetick, &s;hew my knowledge in fractions, and &s;trike the balance between him and the nation. Such a political ledger may perhaps prove that he is in|debted to the Publick for more than three thou&s;and <HI>per ann.</HI> and their gold boxes. What are the city of London? <HI>A mob,</HI> a fooli&s;h crew with furs and chains huzzaing their idol, their king in &s;tilts, as Mr. Hogarth has pictured him, in vain endeavouring to &s;et the world on fire, and holding the bellows to blow the dead coal of &s;edition. They &s;ay, I am an advocate for Ari&s;tocracy. I have turned over
<PB N="31" REF="37">
Sidney and Puffendorf, and fifty other writers in the cour&s;e of my little reading, and find no form of government &s;o dangerous as a Mobocracy. The clenched fi&s;ts are indeed the patriot arms of &s;uch a &s;tate: their only law is club law; and their chief logick is the <HI>Argumentum Baculinum,</HI> which is with them the knock down argument. Such is the cu&s;tom of the city of London. What are all the political writers of the pre&s;ent times, except the Briton and <HI>my&s;elf</HI>? The &s;cum of Grub-&s;treet, the dregs of the church, and the refu&s;e of the legi&s;lature. I have convicted the apo&s;tate Monitor, as well as his patron, the Grand Pen&s;ioner, of political tergi|ver&s;ation. I have put to rebuke the petulant flip|pancy of the North Briton, and have proved him to be a haberda&s;her of &s;mall literature, the pub|li&s;her of a <HI>Chronique Scandaleu&s;e,</HI> the conductor of a weekly libel. The reverend half of him I have &s;hewn to be a mere Oldmixon in politicks, diving among the Naiads of Fleet-ditch, in the mud of Scurrility. The <HI>other</HI> half of him, half military and half legi&s;lative, I have &s;hown to be a down|right Catiline, hatching a con&s;piracy or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion plot again&s;t the characters of the fir&s;t per&s;ons in the kingdom, and like Lord Shafte&s;bury in Hudibras,<Q><PB N="32" REF="38">
<L>So politick, as if one eye</L>
<L>Upon the other were a &s;py;</L>
<L>That to trapan the one to think</L>
<L>The other blind, both &s;trove to blink.</L></Q></P>
<P>Sometimes I content my&s;elf with calling him contemptuou&s;ly <HI>an impudent fellow</HI>; and &s;ometimes I find that he wrote his paper when <HI>exceedingly drunk,</HI> and therefore I di&s;dain to give him a &s;ober reply. <HI>Contempt</HI> is the only tribute proper to be paid by men of veracity and honour, to wretches of their character; ba&s;e &s;landerers who have reviled and &s;till continue to revile, all orders of men, the Commonalty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Royal Family, and Me.</P>

<P>THE following Columns contain nothing more than two &s;eparate li&s;ts of the celebrated per&s;onages, who have at any time been honoured with notice, by the AUDITOR or NORTH BRITON. The&s;e li&s;ts I know mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be imperfect, becau&s;e they are taken down merely upon memory; and becau&s;e &s;uch keen Satiri&s;ts cannot &s;o gro&s;sly have mi&s;pent their time, as to have la&s;hed &s;o few people; yet I have been the le&s;s curious to render the&s;e li&s;ts complete, becau&s;e I know that the writers in que&s;tion are &s;uch &s;tirring &s;pirits, that they will each be continually &s;welling their &s;eve|ral catalogues, for which rea&s;on I have contented my&s;elf with leaving certain vacant &s;paces, for the in&s;ertion of &s;uch names already di&s;tingui&s;hed as I mu&s;t without doubt have omitted, or to be filled up as time &s;hall &s;erve, and the AUDITOR or NORTH BRITON, &s;hall hereafter plea&s;e to direct.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="40">Let us, however, do ju&s;tice to the candour, as well as acrimony of our Political Writers. They deal in Panegyrick, as well as Satire. If they throw dirt with the &s;cavenger's &s;hovel, they al&s;o lay on Prai&s;e with a trowel. Every modern con|trover&s;ial writer in Politicks &s;its down with Enco|mium on the right, and Obloquy on the left, like Jupiter between the tubs of Good and Evil; or to lower my &s;imile, like brother Pamphlet in the Up|hol&s;terer with white-wa&s;h in one hand and black|ball in the other. All their characters, or rather caricatures, may be con&s;idered as the Rough Draughts of the ma&s;ters in the modern &s;chool of crayons, who &s;ometimes draw in Chalk, but mo&s;t commonly in Charcoal. It was my fir&s;t intention to have given both the Chalk and Charcoal Por|traits of each of the great ma&s;ters in que&s;tion; but I &s;oon reflected that I might &s;ave that trouble, by de&s;iring your readers to take it for a general rule, that &s;uch as are blackened in the NORTH BRITON are, by Act of Grace, white-wa&s;hed in the AUDITOR, and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;.</HI> Every great character, like a po&s;t or a wain&s;cot, is de&s;tined to be painted, in dif|ferent colours, at lea&s;t twice over: and in this various light, we may at plea&s;ure, con&s;ider the Two Following Columns either as the two principal pillars of the Temple of Slander, or the two tables
<PB N="35" REF="41">
in the Temple of Fame. As we are now, how|ever, at the very opening of Lent, I would have the noble lords and gentlemen, who&s;e names ap|pear in the&s;e li&s;ts, to regard the peru&s;al of them, as an act of humiliation and mortification; and to remember that they have been told their own by the great writers, under who&s;e aweful names they are here arranged.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, however, be premi&s;ed, as our fixt opi|nion, that the AUDITOR is by far the mo&s;t re&s;pectable character, and the mo&s;t polite and learned writer of the two. The NORTH BRITON &s;ounded the Nether Trump of Fame at the very fir&s;t on&s;et, and furiou&s;ly charged the Scots and the Mini&s;try at once. The AUDITOR &s;et out with profe&s;&s;ions of moderation and impartiality: he did not &s;eek for Defamation, but it lay in his way, and he found it: mark his candid declarations in his fir&s;t number! <Q REND="inline">"The malevolent are not to expect to be gratified with Slander, the illiberal with Scurrility, or the incon&s;iderate with Buffoonery. Ingredients like the&s;e can have no admi&s;&s;ion into a paper, which is undertaken upon principles laudable in them&s;elves; which is intended to reconcile the minds of men to their own good, and to one another; to refute or laugh out of counte|nance
<PB N="36" REF="42">
all party-di&s;tinctions; to extingui&s;h na|tional prejudices, and to recommend that &s;pirit of concord, which alone can make us a &s;ucce&s;s|ful and pre&s;erve us an happy people. In &s;hort it is intended in the conduct of this plan, to try whether it is po&s;&s;ible to talk Politicks with tem|per; to delineate characters with Decency; to treat of factions with Good Humour; and to love our Country without hating Individuals."</Q> Here are mild words; and yet in the &s;econd number, he &s;erves up no le&s;s than &s;ix or &s;even individuals, and &s;ome of them no incon&s;iderable per&s;onages neither: and yet even this trifling incon&s;i&s;tency may be ac|counted for, if we recollect that the AUDITOR him&s;elf begins his ninth number with this reflexion: <Q REND="inline">"It is a cur&s;e entailed upon the retainers to de&s;pair|ing faction, that they are not only Mi&s;erable Men, and Wretched Writers, but they mu&s;t be Lyars into the bargain; they mu&s;t forge Crimes to affright the people, they mu&s;t &s;catter abroad the words of prevarication, &amp;c. &amp;c."</Q></P>

<P>The above li&s;ts not only &s;hew who have been the Butts of Satire to each writer, but may al&s;o with due attention to the turnings and windings in the Court Calendar, &s;erve as unerring guide-po&s;ts to point out &s;uch as &s;eem to be in the high road to abu&s;e from either paper. Being made acquainted with the Colour of the heroes of both parties, we
<PB N="39" REF="45">
know that if a great officer of the court &s;hould be turned out, or to u&s;e the more courtly phra&s;e <HI>re&s;ign,</HI> the AUDITOR will immediately tear out the white leaf wherein he &s;o lately &s;ang his prai&s;es, and, like another Peachum, &s;et his name down in his <HI>black book,</HI> and call on him to exerci&s;e the full powers of the Chri&s;tian virtue of <HI>re&s;ignation.</HI> We know too, that if a noble Member of one Hou&s;e &s;hould call for an able Commoner to lead the bu&s;ine&s;s of the other, the NORTH BRITON will immediately open his deep mouth on that leader, and maul a Manager with as great alacrity as Mr. Thady Fitzpatrick. But as rules and precepts are never clearly en|forced, unle&s;s illu&s;trated by example, I will &s;ub|mit a &s;mall Peep into Futurity to your readers; and as I have in &s;ome places above, rather made extra|ordinary di&s;tinctions in favour of the AUDITOR, I &s;hall here pay my particular compliments to the NORTH BRITON. We have already &s;een whom that writer has abu&s;ed (craving his pardon for the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the expre&s;&s;ion;) and the AUDITOR's li&s;t of Scandal (craving his pardon al&s;o) is a pretty exact catalogue of tho&s;e, whom the NORTH BRITON has prai&s;ed. I &s;hall now therefore, Mr. Baldwin, take upon me to predict, with as much &s;agacity as Partridge or even Bicker&s;taff,
<PB N="40" REF="46">
whom he <HI>will</HI> prai&s;e, whom he <HI>will</HI> abu&s;e, and whom he may po&s;&s;ibly prai&s;e or abu&s;e: and for the fulfilling the&s;e my predictions I refer to time, or even appeal to the Second Sight of the NORTH BRITON him&s;elf. Some that are turned out, I know he will take every opportunity to prai&s;e, and that cla&s;s I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h by Chalk; &s;ome that are put in, I know he cannot re&s;i&s;t the temptation of di&s;prai&s;ing, and that cla&s;s I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h by Charcoal. But there are another cla&s;s of a du|bious indeterminate twilight character, who&s;e conduct will not &s;uffer us to &s;peak preci&s;ely of the colour of their intentions; a kind of heteroge|neous or amphibious animals, Hermaphrodites or Otters in Politicks, neither in nor out, <HI>Pro</HI> nor <HI>Con,</HI> Court nor Country, Whig nor Tory, Scotch nor Engli&s;h; who are, like Sir Anthony Branville, in a State of Fluctuation, and hang, like Mahomet's coffin, in &s;u&s;pence; who &s;eem ready to veer and turn, like approved weather-cocks, with every gu&s;t of politicks; who &s;tand between <HI>Ay</HI> and <HI>No,</HI> like the a&s;s of the &s;choolmen between two bundles of hay; or like Prince Vol&s;cius in love, hip-hop, hip-hop, one boot on, and the other boot off. The&s;e State&s;men of the neuter gender, we can place in neither li&s;t; and yet they &s;eem to bid fair
<PB N="41" REF="47">
for a place in both. Where then can we &s;tation the&s;e lovers of the Golden Mean, but in the Middle? In the Middle therefore, upon &s;tilts between both, one foot on one li&s;t, the other foot on the other li&s;t, I have placed one Right Hon. Gentleman, as the grand archetype of political &s;ceptici&s;m. Far be it from me to arraign &s;uch commendable Prudence and Moderation! but as the NORTH BRITON, is not &s;uch an admirer of impartiality, I have rea&s;on to think, that he will not long permit this gentle|man to remain in a &s;tate of indifferency; he will not be content to &s;ay of him <HI>ALBUS an ATER homo &s;it, ne&s;cio!</HI> but having once brought him&s;elf to imagine, that he has di&s;covered the gentleman's bia&s;s, he will &s;oon be induced to favour us with a portrait of &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a per&s;onage either in Chalk or in Charcoal.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day, April 19, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Remember to have &s;een many Letters in your Chronicle, and other of the Publick Papers, again&s;t the Bill for regulating Franks, which Letters I &s;uppo&s;e were written by per&s;ons, who&s;e intere&s;t or convenience was in &s;ome mea&s;ure likely to be affected by the propo&s;ed regulation. I, Mr. Baldwin, with due reverence to the Hon. Hou&s;e I declare it, am a Member of Parliament, one of tho&s;e mem|bers who mo&s;t heartily concurred in pa&s;&s;ing the bill: fir&s;t of all in a patriot view, being per&s;uaded it would make a yearly addition of &s;eventy thou|&s;and pounds to the revenue of the Po&s;t-Office, which is now publick property; and &s;econdly in
<PB N="43" REF="49">
a private light, imagining it would &s;ave my&s;elf a great deal of trouble in Franking Letters for re|lations, friends, acquaintance, con&s;tituents, &amp;c. &amp;c. But, alas, Mr. Baldwin, I find the fir&s;t of the&s;e benefits expected to re&s;ult from the new limi|tations, very uncertain, and the la&s;t, merely ideal: and though I have but little of the leaven of oppo&s;ition in my temper, yet I now mo&s;t &s;incerely repent of the conce&s;&s;ions I have made, and wi&s;h that many others, as well as my&s;elf, had in&s;i&s;ted more &s;teadily on the pre&s;ervation of our Privilege, and not have re&s;igned it almo&s;t entirely to the Clerks of the Po&s;t-Office, who will perhaps be as great gainers by the&s;e new regulations as the members of both Hou&s;es will be lo&s;ers. As to the advantage re&s;ulting to the revenue from the&s;e re&s;trictions, I &s;hall leave them to be determined by Fact and Experience: and I &s;hall al&s;o &s;hew by Fact and woeful Experience, that the trouble u&s;ually given to Members of Parliament, in the article of Franking, in&s;tead of being the lea&s;t dimini&s;hed will be con&s;iderably increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Coming home from the Hou&s;e, a few days ago, I found, lying on my writing-table, a large packet with the following &s;uper&s;cription: <Q REND="inline">"Mr. L's. compliments to Mr. M. and begs the favour of
<PB N="44" REF="50">
him to Frank and Direct the inclo&s;ed covers: a dozen with the following addre&s;s:&mdash;To Mrs. L. at Sir Hugh Llanvilly's, at Llanvilly Park, near Llanvilly, Merioneth&s;hire, Wales.&mdash;Half a dozen&mdash;To Mr. Latitat, Attorney at Law at Bewdly, near Worce&s;ter.&mdash;Half a dozen&mdash;To G. L. E&s;q. of Trinity College, Cambridge.&mdash;A dozen&mdash;To Mr. L. him&s;elf, in Sackville-Street, Piccadilly, to be u&s;ed by his &s;on, when he writes to him from Cambridge; and one dozen more&mdash;To Mi&s;s Trippit, at Sir William Trippit's, Grove-Park, Berk&s;hire, a con&s;tant corre&s;pondent of Mr. L's elde&s;t daughter."&mdash;</Q>Such, Mr. Balwin, was the &s;ub&s;tance of this po|lite card, and give me leave to &s;ay that, con&s;ider|ing Mr. L. is but a common acquaintance, with whom I &s;ometimes take a turn in the Queen's walk, or whom I now and then join in a morning's ride in Hyde-Park, or meet in an evening at the Mount coffee-hou&s;e, I never &s;aw a more con&s;um|mate piece of a&s;&s;urance. The cool impudence of it &s;tartled me at fir&s;t, but on recollection, I de|termined to take no farther notice of it, than to order it, as we do idle papers in the Hou&s;e, to lie upon the table.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51">A very &s;hort period &s;ince has, however, con|vinced me, that I am to expect many &s;uch applica|tions. Several other equally mode&s;t per&s;ons have taken occa&s;ion to hint to me, that they &s;hall expect the like favour; &s;ome of whom are people, whom I by no means chu&s;e to offend, and others are &s;uch whom I am under &s;ome kind of nece&s;&s;ity to oblige. My wife, Mr. Baldwin, if you are a married man, you will ea&s;ily conceive that I cannot refu&s;e: all the fiddle-faddle corre&s;pondence of my four daughters, my nieces, and &s;ome other Mi&s;&s;es of their particular acquaintance, mu&s;t al&s;o pa&s;s under my Franks and Direction. As to my con&s;tituents, as I repre&s;ent the inhabitants of a mo&s;t re&s;pectable city in the We&s;t of England, where I am brought in for Nothing&mdash;that is, where no Bribery prevails, and it only co&s;ts me about 1500l. in treating, &amp;c.&mdash;How, I &s;ay, Mr. Baldwin, can I forbear to comply with the demands of my con&s;tituents?</P>
<P>Some of my friends, to avoid the trouble of writing their names over and over, provided them|&s;elves formerly with a &s;tamp; but if they could not away with the &s;ingle trouble of Franking, how will they dige&s;t the additional one of Directing? Another inconvenience is, that when the Frank and Addre&s;s are both in one hand, the inclo&s;ed
<PB N="46" REF="52">
letter mu&s;t al&s;o naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to come from the &s;ame per&s;on. It is ea&s;y to conceive &s;ituations wherein this circum&s;tance mu&s;t be par|ticularly di&s;agreeable, e&s;pecially to grave old gentlemen, like my&s;elf; whereas before, all letters, however directed, pa&s;&s;ed without the lea&s;t imputa|tion on the characters of the lords or gentlemen, who franked them. I have known a letter to Grub-Street pa&s;s, without a&s;toni&s;hment, under the &s;anction of the Earl of Che&s;terfield; and have &s;een a cover franked by an Archbi&s;hop, filled up, without &s;candali&s;ing even the po&s;t-man, with a direction to Haddock's Bagnio.</P>
<P>Such, and many more, are the inconveniencies likely to ari&s;e on this occa&s;ion to members of par|liament. But we have brought them on our&s;elves, and mu&s;t take them for our pains. For my part, my chief concern is the trouble, which I &s;hall en|deavour to &s;ave by all the means I am able to devi&s;e, or which you, Mr. B. or any of the ingenious corre&s;pondents in your Chronicle are able to &s;ugge&s;t. My pre&s;ent intention is, to &s;end to the fellow whom we committed to Newgate for forging Franks, and who will nece&s;&s;arily be enlarged at the ri&s;ing of the parliament, offering to take him into pay, in
<PB N="47" REF="53">
ca&s;e he wants employment, and promi&s;ing to re|commend him to &s;everal lords and gentlemen of my acquaintance.</P>

<P>I Have &s;een in your paper, the preface to Poems by a Journeyman Shoemaker, and have al&s;o peru&s;ed &s;everal of the Poems them&s;elves with a &s;ingular plea&s;ure, though I mu&s;t own with much le&s;s &s;urpri&s;e than the generality of his readers. That Stephen Duck, the thre&s;her, &s;hould leave the barn for the garret; or that Jones, the bricklayer, &s;hould attempt to Build the Lofty Rhime, were indeed circum&s;tances &s;omewhat extraordinary; unle&s;s the fir&s;t had been contented merely to wield the Flail of Satire, and the la&s;t, to u&s;e the Trowel of Panegyrick, neither of which were the ca&s;e: But that James Woodhou&s;e, the journeyman
<PB N="48" REF="54">
Shoemaker, &s;hould, as the preface tells us, <Q REND="inline">"&s;it at his work with a pen and ink by him, and when he has made a couplet write it down on his knee,"</Q> is not, I think, altogether &s;o miraculous as the other two in&s;tances, &s;ince there always appeared to me to be a very &s;trict analogy between Ver&s;e-making and Shoe-making. Almo&s;t every Cri&s;pin &s;ings at his work; why may not our <HI>Cri&s;pinus</HI> al&s;o compo&s;e? He may &s;urely, by no unnatural a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, think at one and the &s;ame time of the Feet of his Ver&s;es and the Feet of his Cu&s;tomers; or Hammer out a line, while he is Hammering out the &s;ole of a &s;hoe. It is ea&s;y al&s;o for him to adapt his poetical exerci&s;es to the various circum&s;tances of his Sandalian Employments. He may turn his mind to familiar comick &s;ubjects, <HI>privatis &amp; prope Socco car|minibus,</HI> while he is manually operating on a pair of leathern &s;ocks: and he may with the &s;ame kind of &s;ympathy between head and hand, ri&s;e to all the heights of the tragick &s;ublime, <HI>Carmina digna Cothurno,</HI> while he is making a pair of bu&s;kins, which you know, Mr. Baldwin, are now very much in fa&s;hion. If our author's ambition in&s;pires him too &s;oon to Epick, and to &s;ing with Homer (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">) <HI>the well-booted Grecians,</HI> he may work on boots. He would, I doubt not, di&s;patch
<PB N="49" REF="55">
a book, with every pair; e&s;pecially if he throws in a pair or two of &s;hoes, now and then, as he goes along, by way of Epi&s;ode. Pindarick Odes, which are often on Eque&s;trian &s;ubjects, may be di&s;patched with Spatterda&s;hes; light airy Ver&s;es, with Pumps; and all ea&s;y, carele&s;s, Gentleman-like Compo&s;itions with Slippers.</P>
<P>Scholars, Mr. Baldwin, who want to engro&s;s all the provinces of literature, do not care that any body &s;hould write but them&s;elves; and though the Mu&s;es them&s;elves are females, y&egrave;t if a lady makes ver&s;es they are arrogant enough to bid her learn to make a pudding. Ver&s;e-making is in the pre&s;ent age, generally &s;peaking, as mechanical as Shoe-making. Why then &s;hould not a poor me|chanick &s;hew his indu&s;try both ways, e&s;pecially a Shoe-maker, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion as I have endea|voured to &s;hew, is &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with that of a Poet, and who can write ver&s;es without neglecting his other bu&s;ine&s;s, or rendering him&s;elf liable to the cen&s;ure contained in the old adage of <HI>ne &s;utor ultr&agrave; crepidam!</HI></P>

<P>IN a note to one of M. D'Eon's famous letters, written from London, to the Duke of Niver|nois is the following remarkable pa&s;&s;age:</P>
<Q>After the earthquakes which happened here in 1750, a Lifeguard Man took it into his head to foretell a third, which was to overthrow London. He called him&s;elf in&s;pired, and with an enthu|&s;ia&s;tical air fixed the day, the hour, and the mi|nute. London being already in a con&s;ternation at the remembrance of two &s;hocks, at the exact di&s;tance of a month from each other, and &s;till more terrified at the expected approach of a third more terrible earthquake, which the en|thu&s;ia&s;tical &s;oldier had announced for the 5th of April, the Town &s;hewed it&s;elf &s;u&s;ceptible of all kinds of impre&s;&s;ions. More than 50,000 inhabitants on the faith of this oracle, had that day betaken them&s;elves to flight. The greater part of tho&s;e whom the arguments or railleries of their friends had detained, waited with trembling the critical in&s;tant, and &s;hewed no kind of cou|rage
<PB N="51" REF="57">
till it was over. When the day arrived, the prophecy, like mo&s;t other predictions, was not accompli&s;hed; the fal&s;e Samuel was &s;ent &s;omewhat too late to Bedlam, and the heads of the&s;e fierce i&s;landers, &s;o wi&s;e and &s;o philo&s;ophi|cal, were not proof again&s;t the prophecy of a madman.</Q>
<P>Such, Mr. Baldwin, are the pictures, which Frenchmen who come among us, frequently draw of our nation. Taking a hear&s;ay &s;tory for fact, and pa&s;&s;ing off mi&s;repre&s;entations for truth, they pretend to decide from thence, on the manners and character of the people, commonly founding their opinions on vague reports, idle pamphlets and papers, rather than on their own ob&s;ervations on real life. Thus the &s;tory of the Bottle-Conjurer, fir&s;t ridiculed in pamphlets at home, gave us among foreigners the character of a credulous people; and Bielfield mentions it in his letters as an in&s;tance of our rage for Spectacles: as if the whole town had been crammed into the Little Theatre in the Haymarket; and as if every body, there pre&s;ent on that occa&s;ion, really expected to &s;ee a man get into a Quart Bottle. This is the opinion that foreigners generally entertain of that affair; and
<PB N="52" REF="58">
in compliment to their own wi&s;dom they conclude that the Engli&s;h are Fools.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of M. D'Eon's note gives them al&s;o, as they imagine, another &s;pecimen of our charac|ters; and M. D'Eon him&s;elf having, I &s;uppo&s;e, picked up this &s;tory among other table-talk, &s;ince his arrival in England, puts it into French, and flouri&s;hes away upon it mo&s;t triumphantly. But did M. D'on &s;ee the 50,000 who ran out of town? No. Was he in London? No. In England? No. But he has heard that a lifeguardman fore|told a third earthquake, and that &s;ome weak people were frightened at it, The&s;e he calls the Town, and multiplies them into fifty thou&s;and emigrants, and lays on the remaining thou&s;ands, no other re&s;traint than &s;hame and the fear of ridicule. It is ea&s;y for a lively Frenchman, to draw the &s;evere&s;t conclu&s;ions from &s;uch fal&s;e premi&s;es. But let me a&s;k him, where is that wi&s;e and philo&s;ophical me|tropolis, among which there are no weak per&s;ons? and are they the proper per&s;ons to fit for the true portrait of a nation? Suppo&s;e exactly the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances had happened at Paris, would not the <HI>Bois de Boulogne</HI> have been as full of coaches as Hyde-Park was on that occa&s;ion? Would it be candid in an Engli&s;hman re&s;iding at Paris fourteen
<PB N="53" REF="59">
years after not only to multiply 500 to 50,000, but to throw al&s;o the &s;ame ridicule, which they had drawn on them&s;elves, on all the re&s;t of the town? And yet would it not be very ea&s;y for &s;uch an Engli&s;hman to give him&s;elf an in&s;olent air, and to &s;ay <Q REND="inline">"The faith of this bigotted nation was pinned on a prophecy, perhaps not half &s;o ridi|culous as many other articles of their belief: and volatile under&s;tandings, like chaff before the wind, were blown to and fro by the breath of a madman."</Q></P>

<HEAD>INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Drury Lane.</HI> LAST night was performed at this theatre, for the fir&s;t time, a new comick opera, called the Capricious Lovers, written by Mr. Lloyd, and founded, as the author informs us, on a French piece of Mon&s;ieur Favart, called <HI>Les Caprices d' Amour; ou, Ninette &agrave; la Cour.</HI> Being no great admirers of Operas, &s;erious, or comick, we cannot help &s;aying that we think Mr. Robert Lloyd de&s;erves much cen&s;ure on this occa&s;ion, for the&s;e two rea&s;ons, fir&s;t for linking
<PB N="56" REF="62">
his theatrical labours with tho&s;e of a compo&s;er; and &s;econdly for entering the field of Opera with the arms of Sen&s;e and Poetry. There are charms enough in this piece to &s;educe us into a liking of this Species of the Drama; and Mr. Lloyd is un|warily &s;acrificing to a Ca&s;trato Apollo, in&s;tead of that manly vigorous God of Poetry for whom he and his lamented friend Churchill have always pro|fe&s;&s;ed &s;o &s;incere an adoration. And yet after all, Mr. Lloyd has entirely mi&s;taken the matter, in writing elegant words in order to be adapted to mu&s;ick; for it is a fact founded on experience that nothing is &s;o harmonious as non&s;en&s;e; as a recent proof of which maxim we will venture to &s;ay, that Mr. Ru&s;h's compo&s;ition in the &s;erious Opera of the Royal Shepherd, in which Opera there was &s;carce one line of &s;en&s;e, was infinitely &s;uperior to his mu&s;ical labours in the Capricious Lovers: in which la&s;t entertainment we a&s;&s;igned to the author the fir&s;t place; to the performers, who were mo&s;t ex|cellent, the &s;econd; and to the compo&s;er, but not without an interval betwixt them, the third. Not that we mean to depreciate the talents of Mr. Ru&s;h, or that we do not readily allow his having exerted them in the compo&s;ition of &s;everal elegant airs in this Opera, but merely to ob&s;erve that (perhaps
<PB N="57" REF="63">
for want of u&s;e) &s;en&s;e is not &s;o pliant under his hands as non&s;en&s;e, and that he lavi&s;hed much ex|cellent mu&s;ick, on many a melodious <HI>For,</HI> or <HI>The,</HI> or <HI>And,</HI> in the Royal Shepherd la&s;t year, which would have been better be&s;towed, had he re&s;erved it for the excellent poetry of the airs in this Opera.&mdash;The dialogue al&s;o has much merit, as well as the airs, for which the author is partly indebted to the original French; though we cannot but ob&s;erve that much of the part of Li&s;etta, and all the comick &s;cenes between Hobbinol and Damon, together with their lively appearance in the cata|&s;trophe, with all which circum&s;tances the audience were &s;o highly entertained, are entirely new.&mdash;The performers did great ju&s;tice to their characters. It would be great inju&s;tice not to confe&s;s the me|rit and uncommon excellence of Mrs. Clive, Mr. Yates, and Mr. Vernon. Indeed the execution of the whole Opera afforded us much entertainment, and we liked it but too well.</P>
<P>In order to give our country readers a &s;pecimen of the words, we &s;hall &s;ubjoin two &s;ongs, though indeed they may rather be called elegant little poems, than mere airs in the Opera. There are &s;everal others of equal merit.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES on the PREFACE to <HI>Mr. John&s;on's Edition</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> (publi&s;hed this morning.)</HEAD>
<P>JOHNSON's Shake&s;peare! publi&s;hed! when? this morning&mdash;what at la&s;t!&mdash;<HI>vix tandem,</HI> 'egad! he has ob&s;erved Horace's rule of <HI>nonum in annum.</HI> Keep the Piece nine years, as Pope &s;ays&mdash;I know a friend of mine that &s;ub&s;cribed in fifty-&s;ix&mdash;&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Such perhaps is the language of &s;ome little wit|ling, who thinks his &s;atirical &s;allies extremely poignant and &s;evere; but the appearance of any production of Mr. John&s;on cannot fail of being grateful to the literary world; and, come when
<PB N="60" REF="66">
they will, like an agreeable gue&s;t, we are &s;ure to give them a hearty welcome, though perhaps we may have betrayed &s;ome little impatience at their not coming &s;ooner. Nor have the publick in general been deceived. None but &s;ub&s;cribers have a right to complain: and they I &s;uppo&s;e, in general, meant to &s;how their re&s;pect for Mr. John&s;on, rather than to give them&s;elves a title of becoming clamorous creditors.</P>
<P>But granting our editor to be naturally indolent&mdash;and naturally indolent we believe him to be&mdash;we cannot help wondering at the number, va&s;tne&s;s, and excellence of his productions. A Dictionary of our language; a &s;eries of admirable e&s;&s;ays in the Rambler, as well as, if we are not mi&s;informed, &s;everal excellent ones in the Adventurer; an edition of Shake&s;peare; be&s;ides &s;ome le&s;s con&s;iderable works, all in the &s;pace of no very great number of years! and all the&s;e the productions of a mere Idler! We could wi&s;h there were a few more of &s;uch indolent men in the&s;e kingdoms.</P>
<P>Of the general merit of this new edition of Shake&s;peare we cannot now be expected to give any account. It was publi&s;hed but this morning, but as we obtained a &s;ight of the editor's valuable pre|face a few days ago, we &s;hall now oblige our rea|ders
<PB N="61" REF="67">
with a few extracts from it, together with &s;ome remarks which we have taken the liberty to &s;ubjoin; for the freedom of which we make no apology, as Mr. John&s;on need not now be told, that notwith&s;tanding <Q REND="inline">"the tenderne&s;s due to living reputation and veneration to genius and learning, he cannot be ju&s;tly offended at that liberty, of which he has him&s;elf &s;o frequently given an example."</Q></P>
<P>After &s;ome introductory matter concerning the degree of merit, which we may &s;uppo&s;e to be &s;tamped on works by the &s;uffrage of antiquity, the writer proceeds thus:</P>
<Q>SHAKESPEARE is above all writers, at lea&s;t above all modern writers, the Poet of Nature: the Poet that holds up to his readers a faithful Mirrour of Manners and of Life. His characters are not mo|dified by the cu&s;toms of particular places, un|practi&s;ed by the re&s;t of the world, by the pecu|liarities of &s;tudies or profe&s;&s;ions, which can ope|rate but upon &s;mall numbers; or by the accidents of tran&s;ient fa&s;hions or temporary opinions: they are the genuine progeny of common humanity, &s;uch as the world will always &s;upply, and ob&s;erva|tion will always find. His per&s;ons act and &s;peak by the influence of tho&s;e general pa&s;&s;ions and prin|ciples
<PB N="62" REF="68">
by which all minds are agitated, and the whole &s;y&s;tem of life is continued in motion. In the writings of other poets a character is too often an individual; in tho&s;e of Shake&s;peare it is commonly a &s;pecies.</Q>
<P>Having given &s;ome further illu&s;tration of this argument, the editor proceeds in the following terms:</P>
<Q><P>His adherence to general nature has expo&s;ed him to the Cen&s;ure of Criticks, who form their judgments upon narrower principles. Dennis and Rhymer think his Romans not &s;ufficiently Roman; and Voltaire cen&s;ures his Kings as not completely Royal. Dennis is offended, that Menenius, a Senator of Rome, &s;hould play the buffoon; and Voltaire perhaps, thinks decency violated when the Dani&s;h u&s;urper is repre&s;ented as a drunkard. But Shake&s;peare always makes nature predominant over accident; and if he pre&s;erves the e&s;&s;ential character, is not very careful of di&s;tinctions &s;uper-induced and adventitious. His &s;tory requires Ro|mans or Kings, but he thinks only on Men. He knew that Rome, like every other city, had men of all di&s;po&s;itions: and wanting a buffoon, he went into the Senate Hou&s;e for that which the Senate Hou&s;e would certainly have afforded him.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="69">He was inclined to &s;hew an u&s;urper, and a mur|derer, not only odious but de&s;picable, he therefore added drunkenne&s;s to his other qualities, knowing that Kings love wine, like other men, and that wine exerts its natural power upon Kings. The&s;e are the petty cavils of petty minds; a poet over|looks the ca&s;ual di&s;tinction of country and con|dition, as a painter, &s;atisfied with the figure, ne|glects the drapery.</P></Q>
<P>Has not Mr. John&s;on here made too liberal a conce&s;&s;ion to Dennis? and on an examination of the play of Coriolanus, would it not appear that the character of Menenius, though marked with the peculiarities of an hearty old gentleman, is by no means that of a buffoon? Many have defended Polonius, who is much le&s;s re&s;pectable than Menenius.</P>
<P>The editor then enters into a very &s;en&s;ible and &s;pirited vindication of the mingled drama of Shake|&s;peare, and the interchange of &s;erious and comick &s;cenes in the &s;ame play. His reflections on this &s;ubject he clo&s;es in the following terms:</P>
<Q><P>When Shake&s;peare's plan is under&s;tood, mo&s;t of the critici&s;ms of Rhymer and Voltaire vani&s;h away. The play of Hamlet is opened, without impropriety, by two Centinels; Iago bellows at Brabantio's window, without injury to the &s;cheme
<PB N="64" REF="70">
of the play, though in terms which a modern au|dience would not ea&s;ily endure; the character of Polonius is &s;ea&s;onable and u&s;eful; and the Grave Diggers them&s;elves may be heard with applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Shake&s;peare engaged in Dramatick Poetry with the world open before him; the rules of the an|cients were yet known to few; the publick judg|ment was unformed; he had no example of &s;uch fame as might force him upon imitation, nor cri|ticks of &s;uch authority as might re&s;train his extra|vagance: He therefore indulged his natural di&s;po|&s;ition, and his di&s;po&s;ition, as Rhymer has remarked, led him to Comedy. In Tragedy <HI>he often writes with great appearance of toil and &s;tudy, what is written at la&s;t with little facility</HI>; but in his comick &s;cenes, he &s;eems to produce without labour, what no labour can improve. In Tragedy he is always &s;truggling after &s;ome occa&s;ion to be comick, but in Comedy he &s;eems to repo&s;e, or to luxuriate, as in a mode of thinking congenial to his nature. In his tragick &s;cenes there is always &s;omething want|ing, but his Comedy often &s;urpa&s;&s;es expectation or de&s;ire. His Comedy plea&s;es by the thoughts and the language, and his Tragedy for the greater part by incident and action. His Tragedy &s;eems to be &s;kill, his comedy in&s;tinct.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="65" REF="71">This opinion in which Mr. J. concurs with the Arch Zoilus of our author, is however very di&s;putable; and we cannot help thinking that what is &s;aid in this place, as well as what is after|wards thrown out on this head, in &s;peaking of his faults, is infinitely too &s;trong. A good com|ment on parts of Othello, Hamlet, Lear, Mac|beth, and other tragick &s;cenes of Shake&s;peare, or perhaps a mere peru&s;al of them, would be the be&s;t method of confuting the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions.</P>

<P>Does Mr. J. mean to refer his readers to the Fall of Wol&s;ey, the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Lear, the Mur|ders of Duncan and De&s;demona, &amp;c. &amp;c. or was his mind wholly occupied by &s;ome quibbling &s;cenes in Romeo and Juliet, and the Mid&s;ummer's Night's Dream?</P>
<Q>A quibble was to him the fatal Cleopatra for which he lo&s;t the world, and was content to lo&s;e it.</Q>
<P>Has not Mr. J. been as culpably fond of writ|ing upon Quibble, as Shake&s;peare in per&s;uing it? and is not his laboured paragraph upon quibble as puerile as a remnant of a &s;chool-boy's decla|mation? Be&s;ides, was it not a vice common to all the writers of that age?</P>
<Q>Familiar Comedy is often more powerful on the Theatre, than in the page; Imperial Tragedy is always le&s;s.</Q>
<P>Imperial Tragedy, &s;uch at lea&s;t as is attended with the&s;e effects, is of all others the colde&s;t; and

that Tragick Writer has but very ill effected the purpo&s;es of that &s;pecies of Drama, who&s;e produc|tions are more powerful in the Page, than on the Theatre. Cato, perhaps, may po&s;&s;e&s;s more dignity and force in the clo&s;et; but we know that Richard, Lear, Othello, &amp;c. have mo&s;t power on the &s;tage.</P>
<Q>Tho&s;e whom my arguments cannot per&s;uade to give their approbation to the judgement of Shake|&s;peare, will ea&s;ily, if they con&s;ider the condition of his life, make &s;ome allowance for his ignorance.</Q>
<P>There is much good &s;en&s;e, &s;ound critici&s;m, and fine writing in the&s;e ob&s;ervations on the Unities; and it is certain that a &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the Unities of Time and Place have not only <Q REND="inline">"given more trouble to the poet than plea&s;ure to the Auditor,"</Q> but have perhaps created as many ab&s;urdities as they have prevented: yet it were to have been wi&s;hed, that Mr. J. had in this, as in all other in&s;tances, rather maintained the character of a rea&s;oner, than a&s;&s;umed that of a pleader. All liberties may be carried to an exce&s;s, and the violation of the&s;e Unities may be &s;o gro&s;s as to become unpardonable. Shake&s;peare him&s;elf &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible of this; and therefore introduced the Chorus into
<PB N="68" REF="74">
Henry the Fifth to waft us from &s;hore to &s;hore; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on he brings in the per&s;onage of Time in the character of Chorus in the Winter's Tale, to apologi&s;e for the lap&s;e of &s;ixteen years, the di&s;tance between the &s;uppo&s;ed birth of Perdita, and her appearance as the nymph beloved by Florizel. It might have been worth while therefore to have endeavoured in &s;ome mea&s;ure to a&s;certain how far the&s;e Unities may allowably be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. Such an inve&s;tigation by Mr. J. would have &s;till enhanced the value of this excellent Preface, and mu&s;t have been agreeable to all readers.</P>
<Q>There has always prevailed a tradition, that Shake&s;peare wanted learning, that he had no regular education, nor much &s;kill in the dead languages. Jon&s;on his friend, affirms, that he had &s;mall Latin and no Greek.</Q>
<P>Mr. J. certainly quotes from memory in this place. The affirmation of Ben Jon&s;on is, that Shake&s;peare <Q REND="inline">"had &s;mall Latin, and <HI>le&s;s</HI> Greek,"</Q> which implies his having &s;ome &s;hare of both. Even in our times, a man who has &s;ome Greek, has commonly a pretty competent knowledge of Latin.</P>
<Q><PB N="69" REF="75">Such ver&s;e we make when we are writing pro&s;e; we make &s;uch ver&s;e in common conver|&s;ation.</Q>
<P>It is remarkable that Dennis, though perhaps unde&s;ignedly, has here exemplified his own ob|&s;ervation.</P>

In the mean time, if the following ob&s;ervations on &s;ome of our new editor's notes, on the play of Henry the Fifth, appear to be worth your notice, you are welcome to publi&s;h them in your Chronicle. I had no particular rea&s;on for &s;ingling out this play: but when my books, for which I had long &s;ince &s;ub|&s;cribed, came home, the fourth volume happened to be the fir&s;t that I cut open, and Harry V. the

<P>On part of the Second Chorus, Mr. John&s;on has the following note:
<Q><L>And by their hands this grace of kings mu&s;t die,</L>
<L>If Hell and Trea&s;on hold their promi&s;es,</L>
<L>Ere he takes &s;hip for France: and in Southampton.</L>

<L>Is now tran&s;ported, gentles, to Southampton:</L>
<L>There is the play-hou&s;e now.</L></Q></P>
<Q><P>I &s;uppo&s;e every one (&s;ays Mr. J.) that reads the&s;e lines looks about for a meaning which he cannot find. There is no connection of Sen&s;e, nor regularity of Tran&s;ition from one thought to the other. It may be &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome lines are lo&s;t, and in that &s;en&s;e the ca&s;e is irretrievable. I ra|ther think the meaning is ob&s;cur'd by an acci|dental tran&s;po&s;ition, which I would reform thus:<Q><L>And by their hands this grace of kings mu&s;t die,</L>
<L>If Hell and Trea&s;on hold their promi&s;es.</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="80">The &s;um is paid, the traitors are agreed,</L>

<L>Linger your patience on, and well dige&s;t</L>
<L>Th' abu&s;e of di&s;tance, while we force a play,</L>
<L>There is the play-hou&s;e now.</L></Q></P> <P>This alteration (continues Mr. John&s;on) re|&s;tores &s;en&s;e, and probably the true &s;en&s;e. The lines might be otherwi&s;e ranged, but this order plea&s;es me be&s;t.</P></Q>
<P>But the original order plea&s;es Me be&s;t, Mr. Baldwin, nor can I conceive how any reader of the lines can look about for a meaning without finding it; or indeed how he can mi&s;s finding it under his no&s;e, without looking about at all. Where lies the difficulty? In the three fir&s;t lines? Let us examine them,
<Q><L>And by their hands this grace of kings mu&s;t die</L>
<L>If Hell and Trea&s;on hold their promi&s;es,</L>
<L>Ere he takes &s;hip for France; and in Southampton.</L></Q>
The meaning of this is, that there was a plot to kill the King in Southampton before he could em|bark on his French expedition. This the King him&s;elf explains, <Q><PB N="75" REF="81">
<L>&mdash;this man</L>
<L>Hath for a few light crowns lightly con&s;pir'd,</L>
<L>And &s;worn unto the practices of France,</L>
<L>To kill us here in Hampton.</L></Q></P>
<P>Surely the words <Q REND="inline">"And in Southampton"</Q> did not puzzle Mr. John&s;on. Can an editor of Shake|&s;peare be confounded by an Elleip&s;is &s;o frequent in that author, and all other poets? <Q REND="inline">"The King mu&s;t die ere he take &s;hip for France, and mu&s;t die in Southampton."</Q> What can be clearer? Be&s;ides, the arrangement propo&s;ed is much more confu&s;ed and inelegant than that in which the lines &s;tand at pre&s;ent. For in&s;tance,
<Q><L>And by their hands this grace of kings mu&s;t die,</L>
<L>If Hell and Trea&s;on hold their promi&s;es.</L></Q>
By placing a full &s;top in this place, in&s;tead of a comma, and by omitting the third line,
<Q>Ere he takes &s;hip for France; and in Southampton&mdash;</Q>
&mdash;By the&s;e injudicious alterations you are only generally informed of a plot, without the alarm|ing particulars given in the original reading. And only mark how very aukwardly this poor tran&s;|po&s;ed line is &s;queezed into another corner!<Q><L>The &s;um is paid, the traitors are agreed,</L>
<L>The king is &s;et from London, and the &s;cene</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="82">Is now tran&s;ported, gentles, to Southampton</L>
<L>Ere he take &s;hip for France. And in Southampton</L>
<L>Linger your patience on, and well dige&s;t</L>
<L>Th' abu&s;e of di&s;tance, while we force a play.</L>
<L>There is the playhou&s;e now.</L></Q> Here I think comes out, that the unfortunate words <Q REND="inline">"and in Southampton"</Q> were the &s;tumbling-blocks to our editor. But is not this new di&s;po&s;ition of the lines much for the wor&s;e? and would one not almo&s;t be tempted to &s;uppo&s;e from the great di&s;tance between the King and the relative pronoun He, that the Scene was to <Q REND="inline">"take &s;hip for France?"&mdash;</Q>The propo&s;ed alteration therefore introduces con|fu&s;ion, in&s;tead of re&s;toring &s;en&s;e; and the old reading, in this ca&s;e as in mo&s;t others, gives the true &s;en&s;e. The lines indeed might perhaps be otherwi&s;e ranged, but this order is the mo&s;t natu|ral and the be&s;t.</P>

<P>IF you ever, on Sundays or Holydays, be&s;tow eighteenpence a &s;ide on a hor&s;e, and turn his head towards the We&s;t, you may probably have beheld me, your pre&s;ent corre&s;pondent, placed clo&s;e again&s;t Hyde-Park Wall, a little beyond St. George's Ho&s;pital. My travelling name, or ra|ther the name which travellers on the We&s;tern road have given me, is CAPTAIN NOSE, a kind of <HI>Cog|nomen,</HI> derived, after the Roman cu&s;tom, from the mo&s;t remarkable prominence of a certain feature of my face. Tully, from a &s;imilar rea&s;on, was &s;ur|named CICERO; and Ovid was called NASO, from the very &s;ame cau&s;e that I have been chri&s;tened CAPTAIN NOSE. The poet, on account of &s;ome illicit amours, was driven into exile. I, who am a veteran in the military &s;ervice, am rewarded as hand&s;omely as many other veterans; and while the &s;oldiers of the three regiments of Foot Guards are put into wooden boxes to watch the ducks in St. James's Park, I am &s;tationed a perpetual centry
<PB N="78" REF="84">
again&s;t Hyde-Park Wall, to ob&s;erve the motions of all the goers and comers in and out of this exten&s;ive metropolis.</P>
<P>If you ever were at Paris, Mr. Baldwin, you mu&s;t know that it is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s any of the barriers, without an impertinent fellow of an officer tearing open your coach door, to &s;ee that you do not export or import &s;o much as a bottle of &s;our wine, without defraying the duties on it. Were I to take the &s;ame liberty with every coach that pa&s;&s;es by my &s;tation, &s;uch is the jealou&s;y of military e&s;tabli&s;hments in this free country, that I might probably in le&s;s than a week, fall into the hands of the civil power, be &s;eized by Fielding's runners, be carried to give an account of my&s;elf before the Bow-Street Police, and perhaps ulti|mately be conveyed out of town again towards the North-We&s;t, when I might be allotted a more di&s;|agreeable &s;tation, than that which I occupy at pre|&s;ent. To &s;ay the truth, I do not want to take &s;o near an in&s;pection of pa&s;&s;engers as an highwayman's hor&s;e, for it is ea&s;y enough to &s;ee <HI>how the world goes,</HI> even with half an eye; and though you may perceive that I only glance at them in profile, yet they do not drive &s;o ha&s;tily along, but I am able to give a tolerable account of them. Such an account,
<PB N="79" REF="85">
if you think it will be of &s;ervice to your Chronicle, is occa&s;ionally at your &s;ervice. The Tatler pre|tended to maintain an intercour&s;e with a Spirit, called <HI>Pacolet.</HI> Do not you then di&s;dain a corre|&s;pondent in crayons! for perhaps, even the notified Connoi&s;&s;eur, Mr. Town, did not collect more intelligence from his cou&s;in Village, than you may receive from me; nor did even the Spectator reap more advantages from his inqui&s;itive <HI>&s;hort face,</HI> than you may derive from my <HI>long no&s;e,</HI> ma&s;ter Baldwin.</P>

<P>A Reverend E&s;timator of the Manners and Prin|ciples of the Times, lately decea&s;ed, pro|nounced EFFEMINACY to be the characteri&s;tick of the Britons of the pre&s;ent age; how unju&s;tly, Voltaire, no friend to this country, has taken no|tice, ob&s;erving that the Engli&s;h an&s;wered the charge, by carrying their conque&s;ts into every quarter of the globe.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="87">Were I to attempt to a&s;&s;ign the reigning princi|ple, that governs all ranks and orders of men in this kingdom, I &s;hould not he&s;itate to mention the Spirit of Prodigality and Extravagance, which may now be &s;aid to be epidemical, raging with equal violence in court and city, town and coun|try, and confounding high and low, rich and poor, one with another.</P>
<P>Set a beggar on hor&s;eback, &s;ays the old Engli&s;h proverb, and he will ride to the Devil: though the devil him&s;elf, as Sir Francis Wronghead ob&s;erves, would &s;carce imagine that he would ride po&s;t to him: and yet at pre&s;ent, every beggar has got on hor&s;eback, and &s;eems re&s;olved to run a race with his &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>That he, who has nothing, or perhaps is wor&s;e than nothing, &s;hould not be afraid of being ruined, is not very wonderful; but that they, who are as happy as a good fortune can make them, &s;hould take the greate&s;t pains to dive&s;t them&s;elves of the means of that happine&s;s, I have ever thought very extraordinary. That a Frog &s;hould &s;well with envy, and bur&s;t it&s;elf in order to become a Bull, is a fable who&s;e moral one may readily compre|hend; but what Ae&s;op of antiquity would have de&s;cribed the noble Bull tormented with the &s;ame
<PB N="82" REF="88">
mean pride, and roaring, and to&s;&s;ing, and bel|lowing, till it reduced it&s;elf even below the &s;tate of the wretched animal it might-trample on?</P>
<P>Great goings-out, to quote another old &s;aying, mu&s;t have great comings in. He who now lives to the extent of his fortune, if he multiplies his expences, mu&s;t multiply his re&s;ources, or &s;ee ruin before him. Some minds are apt not to be very &s;crupulou&s;&s;y delicate in the choice of tho&s;e re|&s;ources. A &s;hopkeeper's apprentice, perhaps, commits violence on the Till; an attorney's clerk takes to the Gaming-Table; a trade&s;man <HI>makes a break of it,</HI> and cheats his hone&s;t creditors of eighteen &s;hillings in the pound; a genteel buck takes to the Turf; and a true blood to the Heath. As to &s;uperior orders, the gentry and nobility, they are above committing the&s;e petty larcenies on &s;o|ciety. If a great commoner, a lord or a duke, run out, they need not de&s;cend to the&s;e mean &s;hifts. They need not attack individuals, but reali&s;e the wi&s;h of Caligula, and cut off the head of a nation at one blow. They need not be guilty of bur|glaries, turn Rooks and Sharpers, commit fraudu|lent bankruptcies, or put travellers into bodily fear on the king's highway. They have an oppor|tunity of pro&s;tituting their votes, &s;elling boroughs,

&amp;c.&mdash;In &s;hort they may unite all the abovemen|tioned glorious characters in one. They may turn robbers of their country.</P>
<P>One of the chief &s;chools, or rather academies, of Modern Extravagance, is the Gaming-Hou&s;e. The pupils and &s;tudents are the Rich; the pro|fe&s;&s;ors they who want to get their Riches. Game|&s;ters, &s;ay the French, begin by being dupes and end by being &s;harpers: and perhaps it is impo&s;&s;ible even in this country, to become an adept in the &s;cience without going through the degrees. The &s;everal colleges of Arthur's, Almack's, Boodle's, Saunder's, &amp;c. &amp;c. in the two pari&s;hes of St. James, and St. George, have a numerous li&s;t of &s;cholars and di&s;ciples on their books; and &s;hould one ven|ture to point out tho&s;e, whom every body acknow|ledges to be as well read in the my&s;tical parts of the art as Lookup him&s;elf, who knows but one might incur the danger of a <HI>Premunire</HI> or <HI>Scandalum Magnat&ucirc;m?</HI></P>
<P>I beg your pardon, Ladies! I have not &s;aid a &s;yllable about you in particular yet a-while, it is true: but when Extravagance is mentioned as a characteri&s;tick of the Manners of the pre&s;ent age, You mu&s;t be allowed to have your &s;hare of it.

Many an hone&s;t gentleman has been ruined by his wife's inordinate de&s;ire to outvie the wife of his neighbour. A violent pa&s;&s;ion for Dre&s;s, Equi|page, and Company, are avowedly female failings; but Gaming, that fiend, which is too hot even for ma&s;culine &s;ouls, has u&s;urped a dominion over the minds of our country-women. Conver&s;ation, and fire-&s;ide &s;ociety, is almo&s;t quite lo&s;t among us. Family-vi&s;its, Blindman's-buff, and Hot-cockles are no more. Every evening a&s;&s;embly is a route; and cards the occupation of every meeting; at which every body who plays, play higher than they can afford, from the Penny-Quadrille of Blackfriars, to the unlimited Lu in the liberties of We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>Extravagance, however, like many other vices, commonly counter-acts it&s;elf, and defeats its own ends. Prodigals, even during the &s;hort period of their &s;plendor, rather render them&s;elves ridiculous, than important in the eyes of the multitude. The world is commonly furni&s;hed with ma|terials to judge pretty accurately of the income of particulars; and they who &s;eem palpably to exceed the mea&s;ure of their circum&s;tances, in&s;tead of creating admiration excite pity or contempt. It would &s;eem almo&s;t incredible therefore, did not
<PB N="85" REF="91">
experience confute all &s;peculation, that any per&s;ons &s;hould be &s;o mad as to forfeit all the future happine&s;s of their lives, for the &s;ake of expo&s;ing them&s;elves to publick deri&s;ion for a few &s;hort months, or at mo&s;t for a very few years. The patience of creditors is &s;oon exhau&s;ted, and a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed gentleman, who is often put upon Ways and Means, will &s;oon find it very difficult, and at la&s;t quite impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e the Supplies. He that will not take up in good time, and put him&s;elf under a proper regimen for the evils incurred by his extravagance, may be a&s;&s;ured, that the di&s;ea&s;e will at la&s;t cure it&s;elf. An acquaintance of mine, who loves a pun, often compares a prodigal to a clock: he can <HI>go,</HI> &s;ays he, as long as he can <HI>tick</HI>; but when he can <HI>tick</HI> no longer, he mu&s;t <HI>&s;tand.</HI> I would recommend it therefore to every man, who is about to contract debts, to con&s;ider whe|ther he &s;hall be able to pay them; and before he adopts a new &s;y&s;tem of living, to a&s;k him&s;elf &s;eri|ou&s;ly whether he &s;hall be able to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>I cannot better wind up this rambling di&s;&s;erta|tion, than by annexing to it a copy of a manu|&s;cript now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The original, I am told, was written by that famous military

The per&s;onage to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, as a familiar Epi&s;tle, is &s;till liv|ing, and was then in the heighth of his career of youth and plea&s;ure.

<P>MATTER, &s;ay &s;ome naturali&s;ts, never pe|ri&s;hes: the form indeed is eternally varying, but the e&s;&s;ence remains. The face of whole coun|tries may change, animals die, plants decay, and palaces fall to ruin; du&s;t returns to du&s;t, but the &s;everal atoms are not lo&s;t. We may, with Hamlet
<PB N="87" REF="93">
trace Alexander to the &s;topping a Beer-Barrel; or follow the eminent botani&s;t, Dr. Hill, till we leave him among the Compo&s;t of a Hot-bed of Cucumbers.</P>
<P>The moral world, in the opinion of &s;ome Specu|lati&s;ts, re&s;embles the material. They imagine that the certain portion of virtue and vice, good and ill qualities, which originally actuated mankind, is neither increa&s;ed nor dimini&s;hed. Forms of Goverment, and Modes of Politene&s;s, may indeed have turned them to different &s;hapes, tinged them with different colours and transferred them to dif|ferent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; but they have a permanent ex|i&s;tence: and it would be as ab&s;urd to maintain that they are annihilated, becau&s;e they no longer re&s;ide in the &s;ame per&s;ons, or retain their old names, as to contend that Montague-Hou&s;e is pulled down becau&s;e it is rendered the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, or that Sir Hans Sloane's curio&s;ities are all lo&s;t, becau&s;e they are all lodged in Montague-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>To what region the Virtues that have left this i&s;land are flown, it is difficult to di&s;cover; but in the moral &s;y&s;tem there &s;eems at pre&s;ent to be going on a kind of Country-Dance between the Male and Female Follies and Vices, in which they have &s;everally cro&s;&s;ed over, and taken each other's
<PB N="88" REF="94">
places. The men are growing delicate and refined, and the women free and ea&s;y. There is indeed a kind of animal neither male nor female, a thing of the neuter gender, lately &s;tarted up among&s;t us. It is called a Macaroni. It talks without Meaning, it &s;miles without Plea&s;antry, it eats without Appetite, it rides without Exerci&s;e, it wenches without Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I may perhaps, on &s;ome future occa&s;ion, be ample in animadver&s;ion on tho&s;e Lady-like Gentlemen, who, de&s;pairing to be thought men, are ambitious of re&s;embling women. At pre&s;ent I &s;hall rather confine my ob&s;ervations to tho&s;e adventurous and &s;pirited females, who &s;eem re&s;olved to break though the whalebone and buckram fences of Mode&s;ty and Decorum, and would no more endure &s;tarch in their manners than in a pair of laced ruffles. A certain ma&s;culine air now di&s;tingui&s;hes the ladies; and if you &s;ee a female enter a publick place with a bold <HI>knock-me-down</HI> freedom, &s;et her down for a per&s;on of quality!</P>
<P>Bath and Tunbridge, Cheltenham and Scar|borough, the Theatres, Vauxhall, Ranelagh, and of late years Soho and Almack's, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the only Shew-Gla&s;&s;es for youth and beauty. Taverns and coffee-hou&s;es were appropriated en|tirely
<PB N="89" REF="95">
to the men; and a woman, out of the pur|lieus of Covent-Garden, or the hundreds of Drury, would have fainted away at the thoughts of enter|ing &s;uch places of publick entertainment: but in the year 1770 the ladies of the fir&s;t quality, the <HI>mungoes,</HI> the &s;uperiors of the times, have abrogated the old Salick laws of libertini&s;m, and openly &s;et up a tavern in profe&s;t rivalry of Boodle's, Ar|thur's, and Almack's.</P>
<P>Such a convul&s;ion in the moral world is &s;urely as extraordinary as any former change or revolu|tion in the natural or political &s;y&s;tem: but being once effected, who can foretell how far it will proceed, or how rapid will be its progre&s;s? In a few years the common occurrences of a wo|man's life may more nearly re&s;emble tho&s;e of a man's, than her riding-habit now approaches to his dre&s;s. A lady may &s;oon perhaps intrigue, and game, and &s;wear, and drink, and &s;moke tobacco, more openly than her hu&s;band does at pre&s;ent; and &s;ome future papers may perhaps authenticate the following paragraphs:</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday a duel was fought behind Montague-Hou&s;e between two ladies at the We&s;t end of the town. One of the combatants was dangerou&s;ly
<PB N="90" REF="96">
wounded, and the other having ab&s;conded, is &s;up|po&s;ed to have gained the Continent.</P>
<P>La&s;t week a lady of the Coterie lo&s;t 3000 gui|neas at Faro at one &s;itting, to &s;ome other females of that &s;ociety.</P>
<P>La&s;t Saturday was run for, on the Beacon Cour&s;e at Newmarket, the Ladies Sub&s;cription Pur&s;e, which was won by Mi&s;s Charlotte Hayes's Eclip&s;e. The knowing-ones were taken in; and a gentlewoman who has this meeting been convicted of Foul-Play, has been expelled the Side-Saddle Club by the unanimous &s;uffrage of that honourable &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday twenty-one female pri&s;oners were tried at the Old Bailey, when five were capitally con|victed, viz. Mary Wharton for breaking and enter|ing the hou&s;e of Mr. Jenkins, with intent to &s;teal the goods; Margaret Boldboy for a rape on the body of Jo&s;eph Andrews; Rachel Stephens, Su|&s;an Hodges, and Sarah Hughes for the wilful mur|der of Thomas Simple, by &s;hooting him with a blunderbu&s;s. Seven were ca&s;t for tran&s;portation, and nine acquitted.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that great intere&s;t is making by &s;ome ladies of the highe&s;t quality, to obtain a pardon for Mary Flannagan, now lying in Newgate under
<PB N="91" REF="97">
&s;entence of death, her brother, Patrick Flana|gan, being in keeping with two or three dutche&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>A gang of footpads, in Straw Hats and Red Cloaks, have infe&s;ted the New Road near I&s;lington for &s;ome time pa&s;t. Two of them, very de&s;perate viragoes, were taken by Mrs. Ju&s;tice Foolding's wo|men la&s;t night, and by her wor&s;hip's warrant com|mitted to New Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>We hear that Mrs. Catherine Macaulay will cer|tainly be the Middle&s;ex member.</P>
<P>La&s;t night a &s;treet-walker in the Strand, who has long been known among his fellow pro&s;titutes by the name of Black Tom, was very much mal|treated by &s;ome young ladies who had been &s;pend|ing the evening at the Shake&s;peare tavern. The poor wretch now lies dangerou&s;ly ill, and it is thought will not long &s;urvive. One of the young ladies is &s;aid to be the elde&s;t daughter of a popular counte&s;s.</P>
<P>La&s;t week Mi&s;s Theodo&s;ia Forre&s;ter, being on a party of &s;hooting near her mama's &s;eat in Dor|&s;et&s;hire, had the misfortune of lo&s;ing her right brea&s;t by the &s;tock of the barrel of the gun bur&s;t|ing at the time of her firing.</P>

<P>THERE are in every language, ancient and modern, certain heterogeneous words and anomalous expre&s;&s;ions, which render it more difficult to be acquired by &s;tudents and foreigners than even the mo&s;t licentious idiomatick phra&s;es, or the mo&s;t irregular combination of &s;entences. In vain may the laborious Lexicographer boa&s;t of having traced every radical word through a collateral &s;eries of Parallel Ramifications. The Philologi&s;t &s;till toils with hopele&s;s inve&s;tigation, and finds him&s;elf bewil|dered in the maze of petty Familiarity and en|tangled in Colloquial Barbari&s;ms. The Ebullitions of Convivial or Epi&s;tolary Humour, and the Sal|lies of Dramatick Hilarity, the Lucubrations of
<PB N="93" REF="99">
the Periodical E&s;&s;ayi&s;t, the Sportive Vein and Dry Intelligence of our Diurnal, Nocturnal, and Heb|domadal Hi&s;torians, are almo&s;t totally unintelli|gible for want of an adequate interpretation. To remedy this defect in Engli&s;h Literature, I have, with infinite labour, compiled a Vocabulary or Glo&s;&s;ary, intended as a Supplement to a larger and more &s;olemn Dictionary. It is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that the idle and illiterate will complain that I have in|crea&s;ed their labours by endeavouring to dimini&s;h them, and that I have explained what is more ea&s;y by what is more difficult&mdash;<HI>Ignotum per igno|tius.</HI> I expect, on the other hand, the liberal ac|knowledgments of the learned. He who is buried in Shola&s;tick Retirement, &s;ecluded from the a&s;&s;em|blies of the Gay, and remote from the circles of the Polite, will at once comprehend the definitions, and be grateful for &s;uch a &s;ea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary Elucidation of his Mother Tongue. Annexed to this letter is a &s;hort &s;pecimen of the Work, thrown together in a vague and de&s;ultory manner, not even adhering to alphabetical concatenation. The whole will be compri&s;ed in two Folio Vo|lumes, and will appear &s;ome time within the en|&s;uing twenty years. In the mean while, &s;ub&s;crip|tions are taken in at all the mo&s;t eminent book|&s;ellers

<HEAD>A SKETCH OF DR. JOHNSON.</HEAD>
<P>DR. JOHNSON is certainly a genius, but of a particular &s;tamp. He is an excellent cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar, perhaps one of the be&s;t Latini&s;ts in Europe. He has combined in him&s;elf two talents which &s;el|dom meet: he is both a good Engli&s;h and Latin
<PB N="98" REF="104">
poet. Had his inclination led him to have mixed with the fa&s;hionable world (where he was warmly invited) and had he been a nearer in&s;pector of the follies, and vices of high life, he would certainly have been called by the election of the be&s;t criticks to the Poetical Chair, where Pope &s;at without a ri|val till his death; and then the Laurel, like the kingdom of Macedonia, at the death of Alexander, was divided among many. It mu&s;t be owned that Dr. John&s;on's two Satires in imitation of Juvenal, are among the be&s;t titles that have been produced for the poetical inheritance.</P>
<P>Indeed his morals and manners are &s;o ill &s;uited with loo&s;e opinions, and thoughtle&s;s di&s;&s;ipation, that it is no wonder he was &s;oon di&s;gu&s;ted with what he &s;aw and heard, and which he &s;o well painted and felt in his LONDON.&mdash;His &s;econd Satire (the tenth of Juvenal) though written with great force and energy, yet &s;eems more the fruit of &s;tudy than ob&s;ervation. His &s;agacity is wonderful: though <HI>near-&s;ighted,</HI> he can di&s;cover and de&s;cribe with great humour the nice di&s;criminations, and almo&s;t im|perceptible touches of the various characters of both &s;exes: his "<HI>mind's</HI> eye" has a keenne&s;s and certainty that &s;eldom mi&s;&s;es the mark; and did his pen convey his di&s;coveries in characteri&s;tick lan|guage,
<PB N="99" REF="105">
he would be equal to the be&s;t writers&mdash;but <HI>here</HI> he fails.&mdash;In his <HI>Ramblers</HI> and <HI>Idlers,</HI> whenever he introduces characters, their actions, deportment, and thoughts, have a mo&s;t accurate, and minute re&s;emblance to nature, but they all talk one lan|guage, and that language is Dr. John&s;on's. Words are the vehicle of our thoughts, as coaches are of our per&s;ons; <HI>the &s;tate-equipage</HI> &s;hould not be drawn forth but upon &s;olemn occa&s;ions. His peculiarity of diction has given the Publick a &s;u&s;picion that he could not &s;ucceed in Dramatick Compo&s;ition. His Tragedy of <HI>Irene</HI> is a work of great and ju&s;t &s;en|timent, of Poetical, though not Dramatick Lan|guage, fine imagery, and of the <HI>Osmagna Sonaturum</HI>; but the very &s;oul of Tragedy, <HI>Pathos,</HI> is wanting; and without that, though we may admire, our hearts will &s;leep in our bo&s;oms.&mdash;Dr. John&s;on has wit, humour, and a &s;trong imagination, which are often exerted with great effect in conver&s;ation. I will give, in a few words, the be&s;t advice I can to young rea|ders. Let them admire and &s;tudy his Strength of Argument, Richne&s;s of Imagery, and Variety of Sentiment, without being dazzled with the &s;plendor of his diction. Let them li&s;ten with attention and delight to his entertaining and improving conver&s;a|tion, without imitating his <HI>dre&s;s</HI> or <HI>manner!</HI></P>

<P>IN my boyi&s;h days I remember reading in Bu&s;by's Engli&s;h Grammar of the Latin Tongue, that <Q REND="inline">"K was out of fa&s;hion."</Q> That poor unfortunate Letter is now almo&s;t equally unfa&s;hionable in our own language; and unle&s;s you, or &s;ome other po|pular writer as univer&s;ally read, will interpo&s;e in its favour, this old member of the Alphabet will perhaps &s;oon be entirely cut off. The good offices of a Printer, however, are not much to be expected; for though we formerly heard of &s;uch a re&s;pectable Sub&s;tan|tive as <HI>the</HI> PUBLICK, we daily &s;ee one of your fra|ternity rejecting this old &s;ervant, and giving us a Paper entitled <HI>The</HI> PUBLIC <HI>Adverti&s;er.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="107">To reconcile orthography to &s;trict pronunciation is fanta&s;tical, ridiculous, and illiterate. It origi|nally reli&s;hed of etymology, and in written &s;peech &s;ome etymological traces ever &s;hould remain.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not unnatural to imagine that, on the fir&s;t glance of your eye over the adverti&s;ement of a new pamphlet, addre&s;&s;ed to your&s;elf, you are apt to feel &s;ome little emotion; that you be&s;tow more than ordinary attention on the title, as it &s;tands in the news-paper, and take notice of the name of the publi&s;her.&mdash;Is it Compliment or Abu&s;e?&mdash;One of the&s;e being determined, you are perhaps eager to be &s;atisfied, whether &s;ome coar&s;e hand has laid on en|comiums with a trowel, or &s;ome more elegant wri|ter (&s;uch as the author of <HI>The Actor</HI> for in&s;tance) has done credit to him&s;elf and you by his panegy|rick; or, on the other hand, whether any offended Genius has employed tho&s;e talents again&s;t you, which he is ambitious of exerci&s;ing in the &s;ervice of your Theatre; or &s;ome common Scribe has taken your
<PB N="108" REF="113">
character, as he would that of any other Man or Woman, or Mini&s;ter, or the King, if he dur&s;t, as a popular topick of &s;candal.</P>
<P>Be not alarmed on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; nor, with that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your own merit, &s;o na|tural to the Celebrated and Eminent, indulge your|&s;elf in an acquie&s;cence with the ju&s;tice of ten thou|&s;and fine things, which you may &s;uppo&s;e ready to be &s;aid to you. No private Satire or Panegyrick, but the general good of the Republick of Letters, and of the Drama in particular, is intended. Though Prai&s;e and Di&s;prai&s;e &s;tand ready on each &s;ide, like the ve&s;&s;els of Good and Evil on the right and left hand of Jupiter, I do not mean to dip into either: or, if I do, it &s;hall be, like the Pagan Godhead him&s;elf, to mingle a due proportion of each. Some|times, perhaps, I may find fault, and &s;ometimes be&s;tow commendation: but you mu&s;t not expect to hear of the Quickne&s;s of your Conception, the Ju&s;tice of your Execution, the Expre&s;&s;ion of your Eye, the Harmony of your Voice, or the Variety and Excellency of your Deportment; nor &s;hall you be maliciou&s;ly informed, that you are &s;horter than Barry, leaner than Quin, and le&s;s a favourite of the Upper Gallery than Woodward or Shuter.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="114">The following pages are de&s;tined to contain a Vindication of the Works of Ma&s;&s;inger, one of our Old Dramatick Writers, who very &s;eldom falls much beneath Shake&s;peare him&s;elf, and &s;ometimes almo&s;t ri&s;es to a proud rival&s;hip of his chiefe&s;t ex|cellencies. They are meant too as a laudable, though faint, Attempt to re&s;cue the&s;e admirable Pieces from the too general neglect which they now labour under, and to recommend them to the Notice of the Publick. To whom then can &s;uch an E&s;&s;ay be more properly in&s;cribed than to You, whom that Publick &s;eems to have appointed, as its chief <HI>Ar|biter Deliciarum,</HI> to pre&s;ide over the Amu&s;ements of the Theatre?&mdash;But there is al&s;o, by the bye, a private rea&s;on for addre&s;&s;ing you. Your hone&s;t friend Davies, who, as is &s;aid of the provident Comedians in Holland, &s;pends his hours of vacation from the theatre in his &s;hop, is too well acquainted with the Efficacy of your Name at the top of a Play-bill, to omit an opportunity of prefixing it to a new Publication, hoping it may prove a charm to draw in purcha&s;ers, like the head of Shake&s;peare on his &s;ign. My Letter too being anonymous, your name at the head, will more than compen&s;ate for the want of mine at the end of it: and our above|mentioned friend is, no doubt, too well ver&s;ed in
<PB N="110" REF="115">
both his occupations, not to know the con&s;equence of Secrecy in a Book&s;eller, as well as the Nece&s;&s;ity of concealing from the Publick many Things that pa&s;s <HI>behind the Curtain.</HI></P>
<P>There is perhaps no country in the world more &s;ubordinate to the power of fa&s;hion than our own. Every Whim, every Word, every Vice, every Vir|tue, in its turn becomes the mode, and is followed with a certain rage of approbation for a time. The favourite &s;tyle in all the polite Arts, and the reigning ta&s;te in Letters, are as notoriou&s;ly objects of caprice as Architecture and Dre&s;s. A new Poem, or Novel, or Farce, are as incon&s;iderately extolled or decried as a Ruff or a Chine&s;e Rail, a Hoop or a Bow Window. Hence it happens, that the publick ta&s;te is often vitiated: or if, by chance, it has made a proper choice, becomes partially at|tached to one Species of Excellence, and remains dead to the Sen&s;e of all other Merit, however equal, or &s;uperior.</P>
<P>I think I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, with a confidence, that on reflection it will appear to be true, that the eminent Cla&s;s of Writers, who flouri&s;hed at the beginning of this century, have almo&s;t entirely &s;u|per&s;eded their illu&s;trious Predece&s;&s;ors. The Works of Congreve, Vanbrugh, Steele, Addi&s;on, Pope,
<PB N="111" REF="116">
Swift, Gay, &amp;c. &amp;c. are the chief &s;tudy of the Million: I &s;ay, of the Million; for as to tho&s;e few, who are not only familiar with all our own Au|thors, but are al&s;o conver&s;ant with the Ancients, they are not to be circum&s;cribed by the narrow li|mits of the Fa&s;hion. Shake&s;peare and Milton &s;eem to &s;tand alone, like fir&s;t-rate Authors, amid the ge|neral wreck of Old Engli&s;h Literature. Milton per|haps owes much of his pre&s;ent fame to the gene|rous Labours and good Ta&s;te of Addi&s;on. Shake|&s;peare has been tran&s;mitted down to us with &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive Glories; and you, Sir, have continued, or rather increa&s;ed, his Reputation. You have, in no ful&s;ome &s;train of compliment, been &s;tiled the Be&s;t Commentator on his Works: But have you not, like other Commentators, contracted a narrow, ex|clu&s;ive, Veneration of your Author? Has not the Contemplation of Shake&s;peare's Excellencies almo&s;t dazzled and extingui&s;hed your Judgement, when directed to other objects, and made you blind to the Merit of his Cotemporaries? Under your dominion, have not Beaumont and Fletcher, nay even John|&s;on, &s;uffered a kind of Theatrical Di&s;grace? And has not poor Ma&s;&s;inger, who&s;e cau&s;e I have now undertaken, been permitted to langui&s;h in Ob&s;cu|rity, and remained almo&s;t entirely unknown?</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="117">To this perhaps it may be plau&s;ibly an&s;wered, nor indeed without &s;ome foundation, that many of our Old Plays, though they abound with Beauties, and are rai&s;ed much above the humble level of later Writers, are yet, on &s;everal accounts, unfit to be exhibited on the modern Stage; that the Fable, in|&s;tead of being rai&s;ed on probable incidents in real Life, is generally built on &s;ome foreign Novel, and attended with Romantick Circum&s;tances; that the Conduct of the&s;e Extravagant Stories is frequently uncouth, and infinitely offen&s;ive to that Dramatick correctne&s;s pre&s;cribed by late Criticks, and prac|ti&s;ed, as they pretend, by the French Writers; and that the Characters, exhibited in our Old Plays, can have no plea&s;ing effect on a modern Audience, as they are &s;o totally different from the manners of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and &s;uch as the&s;e, might once have ap|peared rea&s;onable objections: but You, Sir, of all per&s;ons, can urge them with the lea&s;t grace, &s;ince your Practice has &s;o fully proved their in&s;ufficiency. Your Experience mu&s;t have taught you, that when a Piece has any &s;triking Beauties, they will cover a multitude of Inaccuracies; and that a Play need not be written on the &s;evere&s;t plan, to plea&s;e in the re|pre&s;entation. The mind is &s;oon familiarized to Ir|regularities,
<PB N="113" REF="118">
which do not &s;in again&s;t the Truth of Nature, but are merely Violations of that &s;trict De|corum of late &s;o earne&s;tly in&s;i&s;ted on. What patient Spectators are we of the Incon&s;i&s;tencies that confe&s;|&s;edly prevail in our darling Shake&s;peare! What critical Catcall ever proclaimed the indecency of in|troducing the Stocks in the Tragedy of Lear? How quietly do we &s;ee Glo&s;ter take his imaginary Leap from Dover Cliff! Or to give a &s;tronger in&s;tance of Patience, with what a Philo&s;ophical Calmne&s;s do the audience do&s;e over the tedious, and unintere&s;t|ing, Love-Scenes, with which the bungling hand of Tate has coar&s;ely pieced and patched that rich Work of Shake&s;peare!&mdash;To in&s;tance further from Shake&s;peare him&s;elf, the Grave-diggers in Hamlet (not to mention Polonius) are not only endured, but applauded; the very Nur&s;e in Romeo and Ju|liet is allowed to be Nature; the Tran&s;actions of a whole Hi&s;tory are, without offence, begun and com|pleated in le&s;s than three hours; and we are agree|ably wafted by the <HI>Chorus,</HI> or oftener without &s;o much ceremony, from one end of the world to an|other.</P>
<P>It is very true, that it was the general Practice of our old Writers, to found their Pieces on &s;ome fo|reign Novel; and it &s;eemed to be their chief aim to
<PB N="114" REF="119">
take the &s;tory, as it &s;tood, with all its appendant incidents of every complection, and throw it into Scenes. This method was, to be &s;ure, rather inar|tificial, as it at once overloaded and embarra&s;&s;ed the Fable, leaving it de&s;titute of that beautiful Drama|tick Connection, which enables the mind to take in all its Circum&s;tances with Facility and Delight. But I am &s;till in doubt, whether many Writers, who come nearer to our own times, have much mended the matter. What with their Plots, and Double-Plots, and Counter-Plots, and Under-Plots, the Mind is as much perplexed to piece out the &s;tory, as to put to|gether the disjointed Parts of our Ancient Drama. The Comedies of Congreve have, in my mind, as little to boa&s;t of accuracy in their con&s;truction, as the Plays of Shake&s;peare; nay, perhaps, it might be proved that, amid&s;t the mo&s;t open violation of the le&s;&s;er critical Unities, one Point is more &s;teadily pur&s;ued, one Character more uniformly &s;hewn, and one grand Purpo&s;e of the Fable more evidently ac|compli&s;hed in the productions of Shake&s;peare than of Congreve.</P>
<P>The&s;e Fables (it may be further objected) founded on romantick Novels, are unpardonably wild and extravagant in their Circum&s;tances, and exhibit too little even of the Manners of the Age in which they
<PB N="115" REF="120">
were written. The Plays too are in them|&s;elves a kind of heterogeneous compo&s;ition; &s;carce any of them being, &s;trictly &s;peaking, a Tra|gedy, Comedy, or even Tragi-Comedy, but rather an indige&s;ted jumble of every &s;pecies thrown together.</P>
<P>This charge mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be true: but upon examination it will, perhaps, be found of le&s;s con&s;equence than is generally imagined. The&s;e Dramatick Tales, for &s;o we may be&s;t &s;tile &s;uch Plays, have often occa&s;ioned much plea&s;ure to the Reader and Spectator, which could not po&s;&s;ibly have been conveyed to them by any other vehicle. Many an intere&s;ting Story, which, from the diver|&s;ity of its circum&s;tances, cannot be regularly re|duced either to Tragedy or Comedy, yet abounds with Character, and contains &s;everal affecting &s;itu|ations: and why &s;uch a Story &s;hould lo&s;e its force, dramatically related and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by repre&s;entation, when it plea&s;es, under the colder form of a Novel, is difficult to conceive. Experience has proved the effect of &s;uch fictions on our minds; and convinced us, that the Theatre is not that barren ground, wherein the Plants of Imagination will not flouri&s;h. The Tempe&s;t, The Mid&s;ummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice, As you like it, Twelfth
<PB N="116" REF="121">
Night, The Faithful Shepherde&s;s of Fletcher, (with a much longer li&s;t that might be added from Shake&s;peare, Beaumont and Fletcher, and their co|temporaries, or immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors) have mo&s;t of them, within all our memories, been ranked among the mo&s;t popular Entertainments of the Stage. Yet none of the&s;e can be denominated Tragedy, Come|dy, or Tragi-Comedy. The Play Bills, I have ob&s;erved, cautiou&s;ly &s;tile them Plays: and Plays indeed they are, truly &s;uch, if it be the end of Plays to delight and in&s;truct, to captivate at once the Ear, the Eye, and the Mind, by Situa|tions forcibly conceived, and Characters truly delineated.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance in Dramatick Poetry, which, I think, the cha&s;ti&s;ed notions of our modern Criticks do not permit them &s;ufficiently to con&s;ider. Dramatick Nature is of a more large and liberal quality than they are willing to allow. It does not con&s;i&s;t merely in the repre&s;entation of real Charac|ters, Characters acknowledged to abound in com|mon life; but may be extended al&s;o to the exhi|bition of imaginary Beings. To create, is to be a Poet indeed; to draw down Beings from another &s;phere, and endue them with &s;uitable Pa&s;&s;ions, Af|fections, Di&s;po&s;itions, allotting them at the &s;ame
<PB N="117" REF="122">
time proper employment; <Q REND="inline">"to body forth, by the Powers of Imagination, the forms of things un|known, and to give to airy Nothing a local Habi|tation and a Name,"</Q> &s;urely requires a Genius for the Drama equal, if not &s;uperior, to the delineation of per&s;onages, in the ordinary cour&s;e of Nature. Shake&s;peare, in particular, is univer&s;ally acknow|ledged never to have &s;oared &s;o far above the reach of all other writers, as in tho&s;e in&s;tances, where he &s;eems purpo&s;ely to have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Laws of Critici&s;m. <Q REND="inline">"He appears to have di&s;dained to put his Free Soul into circum&s;cription and confine,"</Q> which denied his extraordinary talents their full play, nor gave &s;cope to the Boundle&s;ne&s;s of his Imagination. His Witches, Gho&s;ts, Fairies, and other Imagi|nary Beings, &s;cattered through his plays, are &s;o many glaring violations of the common table of Dramatick Laws. What then &s;hall we &s;ay? Shall we confe&s;s their Force and Power over the Soul, &s;hall we allow them to be Beauties of the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite kind, and yet in&s;i&s;t on their being expunged? And why? except it be to reduce the Flights of an exalted Genius, by fixing the Standard of Excellence on the practice of Inferior Writers, who wanted parts to execute &s;uch great de&s;igns; or to accommodate
<PB N="118" REF="123">
them to the narrow ideas of &s;mall Criticks, who want &s;ouls large enough to comprehend them?</P>
<P>Our Old Writers thought no per&s;onage whatever, unworthy a place in the Drama, to which they could annex what may be called a <HI>Seity</HI>; that is, to which they could allot Manners and Employ|ment peculiar to it&s;elf. The &s;evere&s;t of the An|tients cannot be more eminent for the con&s;tant Pre|&s;ervation of Uniformity of Character, than Shake|&s;peare; and Shake&s;peare, in no in&s;tance, &s;upport his Characters with more exactne&s;s, than in the conduct of his Ideal Beings. The Gho&s;t in Ham|let is a &s;hining proof of this excellence.</P>
<P>But, in con&s;equence of the cu&s;tom of tracing the Events of a Play minutely from a Novel, the au|thors were &s;ometimes led to repre&s;ent a mere human creature in circum&s;tances not quite con&s;onant to Nature, of a di&s;po&s;ition rather wild and extravagant, and in both ca&s;es more e&s;pecially repugnant to mo|dern ideas. This indeed required particular indul|gence from the &s;pectator, but it was an indulgence, which &s;eldom mi&s;&s;ed of being amply repaid. Let the writer but once be allowed, as a nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Da|tum,</HI> the po&s;&s;ibility of any Character's being placed
<PB N="119" REF="124">
in &s;uch a &s;ituation, or po&s;&s;e&s;t of &s;o peculiar a turn of mind, the behaviour of the Character is per|fectly natural. Shake&s;peare, though the Child of Fancy, &s;eldom or never dre&s;t up a common mortal in any other than the mode&s;t dre&s;s of Nature: But many &s;hining Characters in the Plays of Beau|mont and Fletcher are not &s;o well grounded on the Principles of the human Heart; and yet, as they were &s;upported by Spirit, they were received with Applau&s;e. <HI>Shylock</HI>'s Contract, with the Penalty of the Pound of Fle&s;h, though not Shake&s;peare's own fiction, is perhaps rather improbable; at lea&s;t it would not be regarded as a happy Dramatick Inci|dent in a modern Play; and yet, having once taken it for granted, how beautifully, nay, how naturally, is the Character &s;u&s;tained!&mdash;Even this objection therefore, of a deviation from Nature, great as it may &s;eem, will be found a plea in&s;ufficient to ex|cu&s;e the total exclu&s;ion of our antient Dramati&s;ts from the Theatre. Shake&s;peare, you will readily allow, po&s;&s;e&s;t Beauties more than nece&s;&s;ary to re|deem his Faults; Beauties, that excite our admira|tion, and obliterate his errors. True, but did no portion of that Divine Spirit fall to the &s;hare of our other old Writers? And can their works be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="120" REF="125">
or concealed, without inju&s;tice to their merit?</P>
<P>One of the be&s;t and mo&s;t plea&s;ing Plays in Ma&s;&s;in|ger, and which, we are told, was originally received with general approbation, is called, <HI>The Picture.</HI> The fiction, whence it takes its title, and on which the &s;tory of the Play is grounded, may be collected from the following &s;hort &s;cene. Mathias, a gen|tleman of Bohemia, having taken an affecting leave of his wife Sophia, with a re&s;olution of &s;erving in the King of Hungary's army again&s;t the Turks, is left alone on the &s;tage, and the play goes on, as follows:</P>

The &s;tory, thus opened, proceeds as follows: Ma|thias departs, accompanied by his friend, and &s;erves

A complete victory being obtained, chiefly by means of his valour, he is brought by the Ge|neral to the Hungarian court, where he not only re|ceives many honours from the King, but captivates the heart of the Queen; who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion is not &s;o much excited by his known valour, or per&s;onal at|tractions, as by his avowed con&s;tancy to his wife, and his firm a&s;&s;urance of her reciprocal affection and fidelity to him. The&s;e circum&s;tances touch the pride, and rai&s;e the envy of the Queen. She re|&s;olves therefore to de&s;troy his conjugal faith by giving up her own, and determines to make him a de&s;perate offer of her per&s;on; and, at the &s;ame time under pretence of notice of Mathias's being detained for a month at Court, &s;he di&s;patches two young noblemen to tempt the virtue of Sophia.

Mathias (not with an unnatural and untheatrical Stoi&s;m, but with the livelie&s;t Sen&s;ibility) nobly with&s;tands the temptations of the Queen. Sophia, though mo&s;t virtuou&s;ly attached to her hu&s;band, becomes unea&s;y at the feigned &s;tories which the young lords recount to her of his various gallantries at court,

<P>The fiction of the PICTURE being fir&s;t allowed, the mo&s;t rigid Critick will, I doubt not, confe&s;s, that the workings of the human heart are accu|rately &s;et down in the above &s;cene.

<P>The &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages will, I hope, be thought by the judicious Reader to be written in the free vein of a true Poet, as well as by the exact hand of a faithful Di&s;ciple of Nature. If any of the above arguments, or, rather, the uncommon excellence of the great Writers them&s;elves, can induce the Critick to allow the Excur&s;ions of Fancy on the Theatre, let him not &s;uppo&s;e that he is here advi&s;ed to &s;ub|mit to the Perver&s;ion of Nature, or to admire tho&s;e who over-leap the mode&s;t bounds, which &s;he has pre|&s;cribed to the Drama. I will agree with him, that Plays, wherein the truth of Dramatick Character
<PB N="131" REF="136">
is violated, can convey neither In&s;truction nor De|light. Shake&s;peare, Jon&s;on, Beaumont and Fletcher, Ma&s;&s;inger, &amp;c. are guilty of no &s;uch violation. In|deed the heroick non&s;en&s;e, which overruns the Theatrical Productions of Dryden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nobody can have a truer veneration for the Poetical Genius of <HI>Dryden,</HI> than the Writer of the&s;e Reflections; but &s;urely that Genius is no where &s;o much ob&s;cured, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome tran&s;ient gleams, as in his Plays; of which he had him&s;elf no great opinion, &s;ince the only plea he ever urged in their favour, was, that the town had ever received with applau&s;e Plays <HI>equally bad.</HI> Nothing, perhaps, but the notion of Heroick Plays, could have carried the immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the Old Cla&s;s of Writers into &s;uch ridiculous contradictions to na|ture. That I may not appear &s;ingular in my opinion of <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Dramatick Pieces, I mu&s;t beg leave to refer the Reader to <HI>the Ramb|ler,</HI> No. 125, where that judicious Writer has produced divers in&s;tances from <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Plays, <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> (to u&s;e <HI>the Rambler</HI>'s own language) <HI>to awaken the mo&s;t torpid ri&s;ibility.</HI></NOTE>, Howard, and the other illu&s;trious Prototypes of Bayes in the Re|hear&s;al, mu&s;t nau&s;eate the mo&s;t indulgent &s;pectator. The temporary rage of fal&s;e ta&s;te may perhaps betray the injudicious into a fooli&s;h admiration of &s;uch extravagance for a &s;hort period: But how will the&s;e Plays &s;tand the blunt of critical indignation, when the per&s;onages of the Drama are found to re&s;emble no character in nature, except, perhaps, the di&s;|ordered inhabitants of Bedlam?</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="137">If then it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, both from rea&s;on and experience, that we cannot only endure, but attend with plea&s;ure to Plays, which are almo&s;t merely Dramatick Repre&s;entations of romantick Novels; it will &s;urely be a further inducement to recur to the works of our Old Writers, when we find among them many pieces written on a &s;everer plan; a plan more accommodated to real life, and approaching more nearly to the modern u&s;age. The Merry Wives of Wind&s;or, of Shake&s;peare; the Fox, the Alchymi&s;t, the Silent Woman, Every Man in his Humour, of Jon&s;on; the New Way to pay Old Debts, the City Madam, of Ma&s;&s;inger, &amp;c. &amp;c. all urge their claim for a rank in the ordinary cour&s;e of our Winter-Evening Entertainments, not only clear of every objection made to the above-mention|ed &s;pecies of Dramatick Compo&s;ition, but adhering more &s;trictly to ancient rules, than mo&s;t of our later comedies.</P>
<P>In point of character (perhaps the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of the Drama) our Old Writers far tran&s;cend the Moderns. It is &s;urely needle&s;s, in &s;upport of this opinion, to recite a long li&s;t of names, when the memory of every reader mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t them to him&s;elf.

Moreover, Fa&s;hion and Cu&s;tom are &s;o perpetually fluctuating, that it mu&s;t be a very accurate piece in|deed, and one quite new and warm from the anvil, that catches the Damon or Cynthia of this minute. Some Plays of our late&s;t and mo&s;t fa&s;hionable Au|thors are grown as ob&s;olete in this particular, as tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Writers; and it may with &s;afety be affirmed, that Bobadil is not more remote from mo|dern Character, than the ever-admired and every|where-to-be-met-with Lord Foppington. It may, al&s;o, be further con&s;idered, that mo&s;t of the be&s;t Characters in our old Plays are not merely fugitive and temporary. They are not the &s;udden growth of ye&s;terday or to-day, &s;ure of fading or withering to-morrow; but they were the delight of pa&s;t ages, &s;till continue the admiration of the pre&s;ent, and (to u&s;e the language of true Poetry)<Q><L>&mdash;To ages yet unborn appeal,</L>

The Comedies of Terence, though we can|not agree to read them after Bi&s;hop Hare, were evi|dently not written without regard to mea&s;ure; which is the invincible rea&s;on, why all attempts to render them into downright pro&s;e have always proved, and ever mu&s;t prove, un&s;ucce&s;sful; and if a faint effort, now under contemplation, to give a ver&s;ion of them in familiar blank ver&s;e (after the manner of our Old Writers, but without a &s;ervile imitation of them) &s;hould fail, it mu&s;t, I am confi|dent, be owing to the lamene&s;s of the execution. The Engli&s;h heroick mea&s;ure, or, as it is commonly called, blank ver&s;e, is perhaps of a more happy con&s;truction than even the Grecian Iambick; ele|vated equally, but approaching nearer to the lan|guage of nature, and as well adapted to the expre&s;|&s;ion of Comick Humour, as to the Pathos of Tragedy.</P>
<P>The mere modern Critick, who&s;e idea of blank ver&s;e is perhaps attached to that empty &s;well of phra&s;eology, &s;o frequent in our late Tragedies, may con&s;ider the&s;e notions as the effect of bigotry to our old authors, rather than the re&s;ult of impartial critici&s;m. Let &s;uch an one carefully read over the works of tho&s;e writers, for whom I am an advo|cate.
<PB N="136" REF="141">
There he will &s;eldom or ever find that tu|mour of blank ver&s;e, to which he has been &s;o much accu&s;tomed. He will be &s;urpri&s;ed with a familiar dignity, which, though it ri&s;es &s;omewhat above or|dinary conver&s;ation, is rather an improvement than perver&s;ion of it. He will &s;oon be convinced that blank ver&s;e is by no mens appropriated &s;olely to the bu&s;kin, but that the hand of a ma&s;ter may mould it to whatever purpo&s;es he plea&s;es; and that in comedy it will not only admit humour, but heighten and embelli&s;h it. In&s;tances might be pro|duced without number. It mu&s;t however be la|mented, that the modern Tragick Stile, free, in|deed, from the mad flights of Dryden, and his co|temporaries, yet departs equally from nature. I am apt to think it is in great mea&s;ure owing to the al|mo&s;t total exclu&s;ion of blank ver&s;e from all modern compo&s;itions, Tragedy excepted. The common u&s;e of an elevated diction in comedy, where the writer was often, of nece&s;&s;ity, put upon expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t ordinary matters, and where the &s;ubject demanded him to paint the mo&s;t ridiculous emotions of the mind, was perhaps one of the chief cau&s;es of that <HI>ea&s;y vigour,</HI> &s;o con&s;picuous in the &s;tyle of the old tragedies. Habituated to poetical dialogue in tho&s;e
<PB N="137" REF="142">
compo&s;itions, wherein they were obliged to adhere more &s;trictly to the &s;implicity of the language of nature, the Poets learnt, in tho&s;e of a more rai&s;ed &s;pecies, not to depart from it too wantonly. They were well acquainted al&s;o with the force as well as elegance of their mother-tongue, and cho&s;e to u&s;e &s;uch words as may be called natives of the lan|guage, rather than to harmoni&s;e their ver&s;es, and agoni&s;e the audience with Latin terminations. Whether the refined &s;tyle of Addi&s;on's Cato, and the flowing ver&s;ification of Rowe, fir&s;t occa&s;ioned this departure from ancient &s;implicity, it is difficult to de|termine: But it is too true, that Southern was the la&s;t of our Dramatick Writers, who was, in any de|gree, po&s;&s;e&s;t of that magnificent plainne&s;s, which is the genuine dre&s;s of nature; though indeed the plays even of Rowe are more &s;imple in their &s;tyle, than tho&s;e which have been produced by his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors. It mu&s;t not, however, be di&s;&s;embled in this place, that the &s;tyle of our Old Writers is not with|out faults; that they were apt to give too much into conceits; that they often pur&s;ued an allegorical train of thought too far; and were &s;ometimes be|trayed into forced, unnatural, quaint, or gigantick expre&s;&s;ions. In the works of Shake&s;peare him&s;elf,
<PB N="138" REF="143">
every one of the&s;e errors may be found; yet it may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that no other Author, antient or modern, has expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on &s;uch a variety of &s;ubjects with more ea&s;e, and in a vein more truly poetical, unle&s;s, perhaps, we &s;hould except Homer: Of which, by the bye, the deepe&s;t Critick, mo&s;t conver&s;ant with idioms and dialects, is not quite a competent judge.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood, by what I have here &s;aid of Poetical Dialogue, to object to the u&s;e of Pro&s;e, or to in&s;inuate that our modern Comedies are the wor&s;e for being written in that &s;tyle. It is enough for me, to have vindicated the u&s;e of a more elevated manner among our Old Writers. I am well aware that mo&s;t parts of Fal&s;taff, Ford, Benedick, Malvolio, &amp;c. are written in pro&s;e; nor indeed would I coun&s;el a modern Writer to attempt the u&s;e of Poetical Dialogue in a mere Comedy: A Dramatick Tale, indeed, chequered, like life it|&s;elf, with various incidents, ludicrous and affecting, if written by a ma&s;terly hand, and &s;omewhat more &s;everely than tho&s;e abovementioned, would, I doubt not, &s;till be received with candour and applau&s;e. The Publick would be agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed with the revival of Poetry on the Theatre, and the oppor|tunity
<PB N="139" REF="144">
of employing all the be&s;t performers, &s;erious as well as comick, in one piece, would render it &s;till more likely to make a favourable impre&s;&s;ion on the audience. There is a gentleman, not unequal to &s;uch a ta&s;k, who was once tempted to begin a piece of this &s;ort; but, I fear, he has too much love of ea&s;e and indolence, and too little ambition of literary fame, ever to complete it.</P>
<P>But to conclude:</P>
<P>Have I, Sir, been wa&s;ting all this ink and time in vain? Or may it be hoped that you will extend &s;ome of that care to the re&s;t of our Old Authors, which you have &s;o long be&s;towed on Shake&s;peare, and which you have &s;o often lavi&s;hed on many a wor&s;e Writer, than the mo&s;t inferior of tho&s;e here recommended to you? It is certainly your intere&s;t to give variety to the Publick Ta&s;te, and to diver|&s;ify the colour of our Dramatick Entertainments. Encourage new attempts; but do ju&s;tice to the old! The Theatre is a wide field. Let not one or two walks of it alone be beaten, but lay open the whole to the Excur&s;ions of Genius! This, perhaps, might kindle a &s;pirit of originality in our modern Writers for the Stage; who might be tempted to aim at more novelty in their compo&s;itions, when the liberality of the popular ta&s;te rendered it le&s;s
<PB N="140" REF="145">
hazardous. That the narrowne&s;s of Theatrical Critici&s;m might be enlarged, I have no doubt. Re|flect, for a moment, on the uncommon &s;ucce&s;s of Romeo and Juliet, and Every Man in his Humour! and then tell me, whether there are not many other Pieces of as antient a date, which, with the like proper curtailments and alterations, would produce the &s;ame effect? Has an indu&s;trious hand been at the pains to &s;cratch up the dunghill of Dryden's Am|phitryon for the few pearls that are buried in it, and &s;hall the rich trea&s;ures of Beaumont and Fletcher, Jon&s;on and Ma&s;&s;inger, lie (as it were) in the ore, untouched and di&s;regarded? Reform your Li&s;t of Plays! In the name of Burbage, Taylor, and Bet|terton, I conjure you to it! Let the veteran Criticks once more have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing The Maid's Tragedy, Phila&s;ter, King and no King, &amp;c. on the Stage!&mdash;Re&s;tore Fletcher's Elder Brother to the rank unju&s;tly u&s;urped by Cibber's Love Makes a Man! and &s;ince you have wi&s;ely de&s;i&s;ted from giv|ing an annual affront to the City by acting The London Cuckolds on Lord-Mayor's Day, why will you not pay them a compliment, by exhibiting The City Madam of Ma&s;&s;inger on the &s;ame occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>If after all, &s;ir, the&s;e remon&s;tances &s;hould prove without effect, and the merit of the&s;e great Au|thors
<PB N="141" REF="146">
&s;hould plead with you in vain, I will here fairly turn my back upon you, and addre&s;s my&s;elf to the Lovers of Dramatick Compo&s;itions in gene|ral. They, I am &s;ure, will peru&s;e tho&s;e Works with plea&s;ure in the clo&s;et, though they lo&s;e the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing them repre&s;ented on the &s;tage: Nay, &s;hould they, together with you, concur in de|termining that &s;uch Pieces are unfit to be acted, you, as well as they, will, I am confident, agree, that &s;uch Pieces are, at lea&s;t, very worthy to be read. There are many modern Compo&s;itions, &s;een with delight at the Theatre, which &s;icken on the ta&s;te in the peru&s;al; and the hone&s;t Country Gentle|man, who has not been pre&s;ent at the repre&s;entation, wonders with what his London friends have been &s;o highly entertained, and is as much perplexed at the Town-manner of writing as Mr. Smith in The Rehear&s;al. The Excellencies of our Old Writers are, on the contrary, not confined to Time and Place, but always bear about them the Evidences of true Genius.</P>
<P>Ma&s;&s;inger is perhaps the lea&s;t known, but not the lea&s;t meritorious of any of the old cla&s;s of Writers. His Works declare him to be no mean proficient in the &s;ame &s;chool. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the beauties and
<PB N="142" REF="147">
blemi&s;hes common to the Writers of that age. He has, like the re&s;t of them, in compliance with the Cu&s;tom of the Times, admitted Scenes of a low and gro&s;s nature, which might be omitted with no more prejudice to the Fable, than the Buffoonry in Venice Pre&s;erved. For his few faults he makes ample atonement. His Fables, are, mo&s;t of them af|fecting; his Characters well conceived, and &s;trongly &s;upported; and his Diction, flowing, various, ele|gant, and manly. His two Plays, revived by Bet|terton, The Bondman, and the Roman Actor, are not, I think, among the number of the be&s;t. The Duke of Milan, The Renegado, The Picture, The Fatal Dowry, The Maid of Honour, A New Way to pay Old Debts, The Unnatural Combat, The Guardian, The City Madam, are each of them, in my mind, more excellent. He was a very popular Writer in his own times, but &s;o unaccountably, as well as unju&s;tly, neglected at pre&s;ent, that the accurate Compilers of a Work, called, The Lives of the Poets, publi&s;hed under the learned name of the late Mr. Theophilus Cibber, have not &s;o much as mentioned him. He is, how|ever, take him for all in all, an Author, who&s;e Works the intelligent Reader will peru&s;e with Ad|miration: And that I may not be &s;uppo&s;ed to with|draw
<PB N="143" REF="148">
my plea for his admi&s;&s;ion to the modern Stage, I &s;hall conclude the&s;e Reflections with one more Specimen of his Abilities; &s;ubmitting it to all Judges of Theatrical Exhibitions, whether the mo&s;t ma&s;terly Actor would not here have an opportunity of di&s;playing his Powers to Advantage.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE WORKS OF BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR 1778.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="155">PREFACE TO THE WORKS OF BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.</HEAD>
<P>CONSIDERING the acknowledged excel|lence of our Authors, loudly acknowledged by the mo&s;t eminent of their contemporaries and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, it appears at fir&s;t &s;ight rather wonderful, that in the &s;pace of a hundred and fifty years, which have elap&s;ed &s;ince the death of the&s;e Poets, no more than three complete editions of their Works have been publi&s;hed; we &s;ay three, becau&s;e the fir&s;t folio profe&s;&s;edly included no more of their Plays, than tho&s;e which had not before been &s;ingly printed in quarto.</P>
<P>To what cau&s;es are we to attribute this amazing di&s;parity between the reputation of the Writers, and the publick demand for their productions? Are libraries furni&s;hed with books, as apartments with furniture, according to the fa&s;hion? or is it nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e plays were originally written to
<PB N="152" REF="156">
be acted, that they mu&s;t continue to be perpetually repre&s;ented, or cea&s;e to be read?</P>
<P>Truth, we fear, obliges us to confe&s;s that the&s;e que&s;tions mu&s;t, without much qualification, be an&s;wered in the affirmative. Shake&s;peare, admira|ble as he is, certainly owes &s;ome part of his pre&s;ent popularity, and the extraordinary preference given to his plays beyond tho&s;e of all our other dramati&s;ts, to the mode adopted by the literary world to extol him. By the changes of fa&s;hion, Nature and right rea&s;on &s;ometimes come into vogue; but the multitude take them, like coin, becau&s;e they are in currency, while men of &s;en&s;e and letters alone appreciate them according to their intrin&s;ick value, and receive merit, wherever they find it, as bul|lion, though it has not the &s;tamp of fa&s;hion im|pre&s;&s;ed on it. To &s;uch men, the genius of Shake|&s;peare, in&s;tead of ob&s;curing, illu&s;trates the kindred talents of Beaumont and Fletcher: Yet &s;uch men are but rare; and one of the mo&s;t acute and learned editors of Shake&s;peare &s;peaking of his own notes <Q REND="inline">"concerned in a critical explanation of the author's beauties and defects; but chiefly of his beauties, whether in &s;tile, thought, &s;entiment,

<P>To the popularity of a Dramatick Writer, no|thing more immediately contributes than the fre|quency of theatrical repre&s;entation. Common readers, like barren &s;pectators, know little more of an author than what the actor, not always his happie&s;t commentator, pre&s;ents to them. Mutila|tions of Shake&s;peare have been recited, and even quoted, as his genuine text; and many of his dramas, not in the cour&s;e of exhibition, are by the multitude not honoured with a peru&s;al. On the &s;tage, indeed, our Authors formerly took the lead, Dryden having informed us, that in his day two of their plays were performed to one of Shake&s;peare. The &s;tage, however, owes its attrac|tion to the actor as well as author; and if the able performer will not contribute to give a poli&s;h and
<PB N="154" REF="158">
brilliancy to the work, it will lie, like the rough diamond, ob&s;cured and di&s;regarded. The arti&s;ts of former days worked the rich mine of Beaumont and Fletcher; and Betterton, the Ro&s;cius of his age, enriched his catalogue of characters from their Dramas, as well as tho&s;e of Shake&s;peare. Unfortunately for our Authors, the Ro&s;cius of our day confined his round of characters in old plays, too clo&s;ely to Shake&s;peare. We may almo&s;t &s;ay of him indeed, in this re&s;pect, as Dryden &s;ays of Shake&s;peare's &s;cenes of magick,
<Q><L>Within that circle none dur&s;t walk but he;</L></Q>
but &s;urely we mu&s;t lament, that tho&s;e extraordinary powers, which have &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully been exerted in the illu&s;tration of Shake&s;peare, and &s;ometimes pro&s;tituted to the &s;upport of the meane&s;t writers, &s;hould not more frequently have been employed to throw a light upon Beaumont and Fletcher. Their Plays, we will be bold to &s;ay, have the &s;ame excellencies, as well as the &s;ame defects, each perhaps in an inferior degree, with the Dramas of their great ma&s;ter. Like his, they are built on hi&s;tories or novels, pur&s;uing in the &s;ame manner the &s;tory through its various circum&s;tances; like his, but not always with equal truth and nature, their characters are boldly drawn and warmly
<PB N="155" REF="159">
coloured; like his, their dialogue, containing every beauty of &s;tyle, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of con&s;truction, is thick &s;own with moral &s;entiments, interchanged with ludicrous and &s;erious, ribaldry and &s;ublime, and &s;ometimes enlivened with wit in a richer vein than even the immortal dramas of Shake&s;peare. In Comedy, the criticks of their own days, and tho&s;e immediately &s;ucceeding, gave Beaumont and Fletcher the preference to Shake&s;peare; and although the &s;low award of time has at length ju&s;tly decreed the &s;uperior excellence of the glo|rious father of our drama beyond all further ap|peal, yet the&s;e his illu&s;trious followers ought not &s;urely to be ca&s;t &s;o far behind him, as to fall into contemptuous neglect, while the mo&s;t carele&s;s works of Shake&s;peare are &s;tudiou&s;ly brought forward. The Maid's Tragedy, King and No King, Love's Pilgrimage, Mon&s;ieur Thomas, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> would hardly di&s;grace that &s;tage which has exhibited The Two Gentlemen of Verona.</P>
<P>Mr. Seward has employed great part of his Pre|face in citing &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages from Shake&s;peare and our Authors, and though we do not entirely agree with him in the compari&s;ons he has drawn, we cannot re&s;i&s;t the temptation of adducing one in|&s;tance,
<PB N="156" REF="160">
in our opinion, more to the advantage of our Authors than any mentioned in that Preface. It is the entire character of the boy HENGO, in the Tragedy of Bonduca; a character whch is, we think (taken altogether) better &s;u&s;tained, and more beautifully natural and pathetick, than the Prince Arthur of Shake&s;peare. The &s;cene in King John between Arthur and Hubert, excellent as it is, almo&s;t pa&s;&s;es the bounds of pity and terror, and becomes horrible; be&s;ides which, Shake&s;peare, to whom <Q REND="inline">"a quibble,"</Q> as Dr. John&s;on &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"was the fatal Cleopatra for which he lo&s;t the world, and was content to lo&s;e it,"</Q> has enervated the dialogue with many frigid conceits, which he has, with more than u&s;ual impropriety, put into the mouth of the innocent Arthur, while he is pleading mo&s;t affectingly for mercy.</P>

<P>The Reader, we imagine, will concur in our di&s;|approbation of the pa&s;&s;ages printed in Italicks. Between Caratach and Hengo we do not remember that a line occurs, affected or unnatural; and no|thing can be more exqui&s;itely tender than the &s;everal &s;cenes between them. The whole play abounds with Dramatick and Poetick Excellence.</P>
<P>Allowing, however, freely allowing, the ge|neral &s;uperiority of Shake&s;peare to Beaumont and Fletcher (and indeed to all other poets, Homer per|haps only excepted) yet we cannot &s;o far degrade our Authors, as to reduce the mo&s;t excellent of their pieces to a level with the meane&s;t effu&s;ions of Shake&s;peare; nor can we believe that there are not many of their long-neglected Dramas that might not, with very incon&s;iderable variations, be accom|modated to the ta&s;te of a modern audience. The
<PB N="159" REF="163">
Publick have been long habituated to the phra&s;e|ology of Shake&s;peare, who&s;e language, in the opinion of Dryden, is a little ob&s;olete in compari|&s;on of that of our Authors; and irregularities of fable have been not only pardoned, but defended. When the great Engli&s;h Actor, of whom we have been &s;peaking, fir&s;t undertook the direction of the &s;tage, his friend (the pre&s;ent Laureat) boldly told him,
<Q><L>A nation's ta&s;te depends on you.</L></Q>
The national ta&s;te, under his happy influence, acquired from day to day, from year to year, an encrea&s;ed reli&s;h for Shake&s;peare; and it is almo&s;t matter of amazement, as well as concern, that &s;o little of his attention was directed to tho&s;e Dra|matick Writers, who&s;e poetical character bore &s;o great an affinity to the ju&s;t object of his admira|tion. A decea&s;ed actor, of great merit, and &s;till greater promi&s;e, very &s;ucce&s;sfully opened his the|atrical career by appearing in the tragedy of Phila&s;ter. At the &s;ame time, the &s;ame tragedy contributed not a little to the growing fame of one of our principal actre&s;&s;es. That play, the Two Noble Kin&s;men, and &s;ome other pieces of Beau|mont and Fletcher, be&s;ides tho&s;e we have already enumerated, would undoubtedly become favourite
<PB N="160" REF="164">
entertainments for the &s;tage, if the theatrical ta|lents of the performers bore any kind of propor|tion to the dramatick abilities of the writers. Since the directors of our theatres in &s;ome &s;ort hold the keys of the Temple of Dramatick Fame, let them do honour to them&s;elves by throwing open their doors to Beaumont and Fletcher! Seeing there are at pre&s;ent but &s;mall hopes of emulating the tran|&s;cendent actor, who &s;o long and &s;o effectually im|pre&s;&s;ed on our minds the excellence of Shake|&s;peare, let them at lea&s;t re&s;cue their performers from an immediate compari&s;on, &s;o much to their di&s;advantage, by trying their force on the charac|ters of our Authors! The Two Noble Kin&s;men indeed, has been a&s;cribed (fal&s;ely, as we think) to Shake&s;peare. <Q REND="inline">"The Two Noble Kin&s;men, (&s;ays Pope) if that play be his, <HI>as there goes a tradi|tion</HI> it was, and indeed <HI>it has little re&s;emblance of Fletcher,</HI> and more of our author, than &s;ome of tho&s;e which have been received as genuine."</Q> Unhappy Poets! who&s;e very excellence is turned again&s;t them. Shake&s;peare's claim to any &s;hare in the Two Noble Kin&s;men we have con&s;idered at the end of that piece, to which we refer the Reader. In this place we &s;hall only enter our prote&s;t again&s;t

In his Preface indeed he has, with a mo&s;t ma&s;terly hand, drawn the out|line of the poetical character of Shake&s;peare; but in that very Preface, by a &s;trange perver&s;ion of ta&s;te, he propo&s;es to throw out of the li&s;t of Shake|&s;peare's plays The Winter's Tale, which he con|&s;iders as &s;purious! On no better foundation, we think, has he a&s;&s;erted, that the play of the Two Noble Kin&s;men <HI>has little re&s;emblance of Fletcher.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"There goes a tradition,"</Q> that <HI>Garth did not write his own Di&s;pen&s;ary</HI>; <Q REND="inline">"there goes a tradition,"</Q> that the admirable tran&s;lator of Homer, like Shake&s;peare him&s;elf, had <HI>little Latin, and le&s;s Greek</HI>; but what candid critick would countenance &s;uch a tradition? And is &s;uch a vague, blind, playhou&s;e tradition a &s;ufficient warrant for one great poet to tear the laurel from the brows of another?</P>
<P>The modern editors of Shake&s;peare contemplate with admiration that indifference to future fame, which &s;uffered him to behold with uncommon

apathy &s;ome of his pieces incorrectly printed dur|ing his life, without attempting to re&s;cue them from the hands of barbarous editors, or preparing for po&s;terity a genuine collection of his Works, &s;upervi&s;ed and corrected by him&s;elf. In our opinion, the Dedication and Preface of Heminge and Con|dell more than in&s;inuate the intention of Shake|&s;peare, had he &s;urvived, to have publi&s;hed &s;uch a collection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>We hope, that they outliving him, and he not having the fate common with &s;ome, to be Exequutor to his own writings, &amp;c. <BIBL>[Dedication of Shake&s;peare's Works by Heminge and Condell.</BIBL></Q><Q>It had been a thing, we confe&s;&s;e, worthy to have been wi&s;hed <HI>that the Author him&s;elf had lived to have &s;et forth, and over|&s;eene his own writings; but &s;ince it has been ordained otherwi&s;e, and he by death departed from that right,</HI> we pray you doe not envy his friends, the office of their care and paine, to have collected and publi&s;hed them. <BIBL>[Preface of Heminge and Condell.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. But, be that as it may, his &s;up|po&s;ed carele&s;&s;ne&s;s concerning the fate of his pieces after they had been repre&s;ented, is not &s;o very &s;ingular; many of the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher al&s;o having been inaccurately printed from &s;tolen copies during the lives of the Authors, and the remainder collected &s;ome years after their deaths, like the Works of Shake&s;peare, by the players. Ben Jon&s;on appears to have been the only
<PB N="163" REF="167">
dramatick Poet of that age, who paid any attention to the publication of his own Compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>The old quarto copies of Beaumont and Fletcher have come down to us exactly in the &s;ame &s;tate with the old quartos of Shake&s;peare. The printers of tho&s;e times not only copied, but multiplied the errors of the tran&s;criber. An Editor, nay even a corrector of the pre&s;s, &s;eems to have been a character of which they had not the &s;malle&s;t conception. Even the title-pages appear to exhibit the very names of the Authors at random, &s;ometimes announcing the play as the work of one Poet, &s;ometimes of another, and &s;ometimes as the joint production of both. A Book&s;eller is &s;omewhere introduced as reprehending <HI>the &s;aving ways of an Ode-writer,</HI> who, he &s;uppo&s;ed, merely to lengthen his work, would often put no more than three or four words into a line. The old printers &s;eem to have con|ceived the &s;ame idea of the par&s;imony of Poets, and therefore often without &s;cruple run ver&s;e into pro&s;e, not adverting to mea&s;ure or harmony, but &s;olely governed by the dimen&s;ions of the page, whether divided into columns, or carried all acro&s;s from one &s;canty margin to another. Their orthography<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Their orthography,</HI> &amp;c.] To this article our ance&s;tors &s;eem to have afforded very little attention: <HI>Ingenions</HI> for <HI>ingenuous, alter</HI> for <HI>altar, cozen</HI> for <HI>cou&s;in, de&s;ert</HI> for <HI>defart, talents</HI> for <HI>talons, then</HI> for <HI>than,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. continually occur in the old books. Nor does there &s;eem to have been any greater regard paid to proper names; one of our Poets, for in&s;tance, we find called <HI>Fleatcher, Flecher,</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI>; and the other, <HI>Beamont, Beamount,</HI> and <HI>Beaumont.</HI> The name of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> is &s;pelt at lea&s;t a dozen ways. We are told, in the fir&s;t note on the Dunciad of <Q REND="inline">"an <HI>autograph</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> him&s;elf, whereby it appeared that he &s;pelt his own name without the fir&s;t <HI>e.</HI>"</Q> Yet even this <HI>auto|graph</HI> is not deci&s;ive. In the Regi&s;ter-book at Stratford upon Avon, the name of the family is regularly entered <HI>Shak&s;pere.</HI> In the Poet's own will, which now lies in the Prerogative-Office, Doctor's Com|mons, his name is &s;pelt THREE different ways. In the body of the will it is always written <HI>Shack&s;pere:</HI> This, however, may be a&s;cribed to the Lawyer. The will con&s;i&s;ts of three &s;heets, the fir&s;t of which is legibly &s;ub&s;cribed <HI>Shack&s;pere</HI>; the two others <HI>Shak&s;peare.</HI> It mu&s;t be acknowledged that the hand-writing, as well as &s;ituation of the fir&s;t &s;ignature, is different from that of the two following; but it appears extraordinary that a &s;tranger &s;hould attempt to fal&s;ify a &s;ig|nature, which is u&s;ually a&s;cribed to each &s;heet for the &s;ake of giving authenticity to &s;o &s;olemn an in&s;trument, and is, therefore, always taken to be the hand-writing of the te&s;tator. Mr. Garrick, how|ever, had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the lea&s;e of a hou&s;e formerly &s;ituated in Black-Friars, and but lately taken down on account of the new bridge, which belonged to that Poet. As a party to that lea&s;e he &s;igns his name <HI>Shak&s;peare</HI>; and the fir&s;t &s;yllable of his name is now pronounced in his native county, Warwick&s;hire, with the &s;hort <HI>a, Sh~ak-</HI> and not <HI>Sh~ake&s;peare.</HI> On the other hand, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the dialect of that county is more provincial than cla&s;&s;ical, and we believe that all the families, who are now known by the Poet's name, both &s;pell and pronounce it <HI>Sh~ake&s;peare</HI>; which indeed &s;eems mo&s;t reconcilable to etimology, if etimology be at all concern|ed in &s;o capricious a circum&s;tance. Many of the quartos publi&s;hed in his life-time, not only followed this mode of &s;pelling, but &s;eemed nicely to mark the proper pronunciation, by printing his name in the title page with a <HI>Hyphen</HI> between the two &s;yllables that compo&s;e it, thus, SHAKE-SPEARE. His cotemporary Jon&s;on, as well as Mil|ton and Dryden his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, adhered to the &s;ame orthography. Every thing, however trivial, intere&s;ts an Engli&s;h reader, from the relation it bears to that Great Poet; which is the only excu&s;e we have to offer for &s;o long a note on a point of &s;o little importance.</NOTE> is

&s;o generally vicious and un&s;ettled, and their punc|tuation &s;o totally defective, that the regulation of either rarely merits the triumphs that have &s;o often been derived from it. On the whole, however, the&s;e old copies of our Poets may by an intelligent Reader be peru&s;ed with &s;atisfaction. The typo|graphical errors are indeed gro&s;s and numerous; but their very number and gro&s;&s;ne&s;s keeps the reader awake to the genuine text, and commonly

<PB N="165" REF="169">
renders &s;uch palpable inaccuracies not prejudicial. The genuine work of the Author is there extant, though the lines are often, like a confu&s;ed multi|tude, huddled on one another, and not mar&s;halled and arrayed by the di&s;cipline of a modern Editor.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Folio, containing thirty-four of our Author's pieces, never till then collected or printed, was publi&s;hed by the Players, obviou&s;ly tran&s;cribed
<PB N="166" REF="170">
from the prompter's books, commonly the mo&s;t inaccurate and barbarous of all manu&s;cripts, or made out piecemeal from the detached parts copied for the u&s;e of the performers. Hence it happens, that the &s;tage-direction has &s;ometimes crept into the text, and the name of the Actor is now and then &s;ub&s;tituted for that of the Character. The tran&s;cribers, knowing perhaps no Language per|fectly, corrupted all Languages; and vitiated the dialogue with fal&s;e Latin, fal&s;e French, fal&s;e Italian, and fal&s;e Spani&s;h; nay, as Pope &s;ays of the old copies of Shake&s;peare, <Q REND="inline">"their very Welch is fal&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>The Players, however, notwith&s;tanding the cen&s;ure of Pope, <Q REND="inline">"yet from Cibber &s;ore,"</Q> &s;eem to have been, at lea&s;t with regard to our Poets, as faithful and able editors as others of that period. It is mo&s;t natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the Playhou&s;e Manu&s;cript contained the real Work of the Author, though perhaps ignorantly copied, and accommodated to the u&s;e of the Theatre. A writer in his clo&s;et often &s;ilently acquie&s;ces in the excellence of a continued Declamation; but if at any time the Audience, like Polonius, cry out <Q REND="inline">"This is too long,"</Q> &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages are afterwards naturally curtailed or omitted in the repre&s;enta|tion;
<PB N="167" REF="171">
but the curious Reader, being le&s;s <HI>fa&s;tidious</HI> <Q REND="inline">"than the <HI>proud</HI> Spectator"</Q> (for in &s;uch terms Horace &s;peaks of the Spectator) is plea&s;ed with the re&s;toration of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in print. <Q REND="inline">"Players, &s;ays Pope, "are ju&s;t &s;uch judges of what is <HI>right,</HI> as tailors are of what is <HI>graceful.</HI>"</Q> The compari&s;on is more ludicrous and &s;arca&s;tick than it is ju&s;t. The Poet him&s;elf, who makes the Cloaths, may rather be called the Tailor: Actors are at mo&s;t but the empty beaux that wear them, and the Spectators cen&s;ure or admire them. A Tailor, however, if players mu&s;t be the Tailors, though not equal in &s;cience to a Statuary or an Anatomi&s;t, mu&s;t yet be conceived to have a more intimate knowledge of the human form than a Black&s;mith or a Capenter; and if many of the actors know but little of the Drama, they would probably have known &s;till le&s;s of it, had they not been retainers to the &s;tage. Some Improvements, as well as Corruptions of the Drama, may undoubtedly be derived from the Theatre. Cibber, <HI>idle</HI> Cibber, wrote for the &s;tage with more &s;ucce&s;s than Pope. Ae&s;chylus, Sophocles, Plautus, and Terence, were &s;oldiers and freedmen; Shake&s;peare and Moliere were Actors.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="172">The Second Folio contained the fir&s;t complete collection of the Works of Beaumont and Fletcher. Concerning that edition we have nothing to add to what has been &s;aid by other Editors.</P>
<P>The Octavo Editors of 1711 &s;eemed to aim at little more than reprinting our Authors' Plays, and giving a collection of them more portable and convenient than the Folios. Their text, however, is more corrupt than that of either the quartos or folios, the errors of which they religiou&s;ly pre|&s;erved, adding many vicious readings of their own, &s;ome of which have been combated in very long notes by their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>In the year 1742, Theobald, on the &s;ucce&s;s and reputation of his Shake&s;peare, projected an edition of the Works of Ben Jon&s;on. What he had executed of it, fell into the hands of Mr. Whalley, and is in&s;erted in that learned and in|genious gentleman's edition. At the &s;ame time he exhibited propo&s;als for a publication of the Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher; in which he was afterwards a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. Seward and Mr. Symp&s;on: but Theobald dying before he had com|mitted more than the fir&s;t and about half the &s;econd volume to the pre&s;s, the undertaking was con|tinued by the two la&s;t-mentioned gentlemen; and
<PB N="169" REF="173">
the edition thus jointly, or rather &s;everally, exe|cuted by Theobald, Mr. Seward, and Mr. Symp&s;on, at length appeared in the year 1750. The&s;e gen|tlemen were the fir&s;t Editors of our Poets who profe&s;&s;ed to collate the old copies, to reform the punctuation, and to amend the corruptions of the text. Some attempts al&s;o were made to elucidate the ob&s;curities, and enforce the excellencies of their Authors. How far we di&s;agree or coincide with them will appear on in&s;pection of the parti|cular pa&s;&s;ages to which their &s;everal ob&s;ervations refer. At pre&s;ent it will be &s;ufficient to declare, that we &s;hould have been inclined to entertain a more re&s;pectful opinion of their labours, if they had not very early betrayed that confidence which every Reader is tempted to repo&s;e in an Editor, not only by their carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, but by the more un|pardonable faults of faithle&s;&s;ne&s;s and mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion. Their reports of the &s;tate of the old copies can never &s;afely be taken on tru&s;t, and on examina|tion many of tho&s;e copies will appear to be both negligently collated, and untruly quoted. Their punctuation al&s;o, notwith&s;tanding their occa&s;ional &s;elf-approbation, is almo&s;t as inaccurate as that of the mo&s;t antient and rude editions; and their criti|cal remarks have, in our opinion, oftener been well
<PB N="170" REF="174">
intended, than conceived. Their work, however, has in the main conduced to the illu&s;tration of our Authors, and we have &s;ei&s;ed every fair occa&s;ion to applaud the di&s;play of their diligence, as well as the efforts of their critical acutene&s;s and &s;agacity. Such of their notes as appeared inconte&s;tible, or even plau&s;ible, we have adopted without remark; to tho&s;e more dubious we have &s;ubjoined additional annotations; tho&s;e of le&s;s con&s;equence we have abridged; and tho&s;e of no importance we have omitted.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent Edition, it has been our chief aim to give the old text as it lies in the old books, with no other variations, but &s;uch as the Writers them&s;elves, had they &s;uperintended an impre&s;&s;ion of their Works, or even a corrector of the pre&s;s, would have made. Yet even the&s;e variations, if at all important, have not been made in &s;ilence. Notes, however, have been &s;ubjoined to the text as briefly and as &s;paringly as po&s;&s;ible; but the lap&s;e of time, and fluctuation of language, have rendered &s;ome Notes nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e of explaining ob&s;olete words, unu&s;ual phra&s;es, old cu&s;toms, and ob&s;cure or di&s;tant allu&s;ions. Critical remarks, and conjectural emendations, have been &s;eldom hazard|ed, nor has any ridicule been wantonly thrown on
<PB N="171" REF="175">
former Editors, who have only &s;ometimes been re|prehended for pompous affectation, and more fre|quently for want of care and fidelity. Every ma|terial comment on the&s;e Plays has been retained in this Edition, though often without the long and o&s;tentatious notes that fir&s;t introduced tho&s;e com|ments to the publick. At the &s;ame time, we have religiou&s;ly attributed every ob&s;ervation, critical or philological, to its due author, not wi&s;hing to claim any prai&s;e as Editors, but by indu&s;triou&s;ly endeavouring, as an act of duty, to collect from all quarters every thing that might contribute to il|lu&s;trate the Works of Beaumont and Fletcher.</P>
<P>To conclude, we have beheld with pity and indignation the mean parade of many modern Editors, and we have endeavoured to fulfil their du|ties without imbibing their arrogance. We are perhaps too proud to indulge &s;o poor a vanity; at lea&s;t, we are too much occupied to litigate read|ings we think of &s;mall importance, and too hone&s;t to claim re&s;torations not our own, or to propo&s;e readings as corrections that are no more than re|&s;torations. The Stationer has not di&s;graced our Authors with Tobacco-Paper; the Pre&s;s, we tru&s;t, has done its duty; and the Rolling-Pre&s;s, at a very con&s;iderable expence, has added its
<PB N="172" REF="176">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Cuts, if we are not deceived, are for the mo&s;t part happily de&s;igned, and well exe|cuted, and will probably be deemed an agreeable addition to the Work: at lea&s;t, we may with truth a&s;&s;ert, that no authors in the Engli&s;h language, publi&s;hed at the &s;ame price, have &s;o many and &s;o valuable engravings.</P>
<P>The province of a Painter and an Editor are directly oppo&s;ite. In the fir&s;t in&s;tance the canvas receives its chief value from the arti&s;t, and in the &s;econd the arti&s;t derives almo&s;t all his con&s;equence from the canvas. The Editor, if he lives, is car|ried down the &s;tream of time by his Author; and if the Author be excellent, and his commentary judicious,
<Q><L>Still &s;hall his little bark attendant &s;ail,</L>
<L>Pur&s;ue the triumph and partake the gale.</L></Q>
For our parts we have been incited to this un|dertaking from a real admiration of the&s;e Poets, grounded, as we apprehend, on their genuine ex|cellencies, and a thorough per&s;ua&s;ion that the Works of Beaumont and Fletcher may proudly claim a &s;econd place in the Engli&s;h Drama, nearer to the fir&s;t than the third, to tho&s;e of Shake&s;peare; &s;ome of their Plays being &s;o much in his manner, that they can &s;carcely be di&s;tingu&s;hed to be the work of another hand.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR 1768.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="178">APPENDIX TO THE SECOND EDITION OF THE TRANSLATION OF THE COMEDIES OF TERENCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE reverend and ingenious Mr. Farmer, in his curious and entertaining <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Learning of Shake&s;peare,</HI> having done me the honour to animadvert on &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the preface to this tran&s;lation, I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this edition with|out declaring how far I coincide with that gentle|man; although what I then threw out carele&s;sly on the &s;ubject of his pamphlet was merely inci|dental, nor did I mean to enter the li&s;ts as a champion to defend either &s;ide of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t true, as Mr. Farmer takes for granted, that I had never met with the old comedy called <HI>The Suppo&s;es,</HI> nor has it even yet fallen into my
<PB N="174" REF="179">
hands; yet I am willing to grant, on Mr. Farmer's authority, that Shake&s;peare borrowed part of the plot of The Taming of the Shrew, from that old tran&s;lation of Ario&s;to's play, by George Ga&s;coign, and had no obligations to Plautus. I will accede al&s;o to the truth of Dr. John&s;on's and Mr. Farmer's ob&s;ervation, that the line from Terence, exactly as it &s;tands in Shake&s;peare, is extant in Lilly and Udall's <HI>Floures for Latin Speaking.</HI> Still, however, Shake&s;peare's total ignorance of the learned languages remains to be proved; for it mu&s;t be granted, that &s;uch books are put into the hands of tho&s;e who are learning tho&s;e languages, in which cla&s;s we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily rank Shake&s;peare, or he could not even have quoted Terence from Udall or Lilly; nor is it likely, that &s;o rapid a genius &s;hould not have made &s;ome further progre&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"Our author (&s;ays Dr. John&s;on, as quoted by Mr. Farmer) had this line from Lilly; which I mention, that it may not be brought as an argu|ment of his learning."</Q> It is, however, an argu|ment that he read Lilly; and a few pages further it &s;eems pretty certain, that the author of <HI>The Taming of the Shrew,</HI> had at lea&s;t read Ovid; from who&s;e epi&s;tles we find the&s;e lines:
<Q><PB N="175" REF="180">
<L>H&agrave;c ibat Simois; hic e&s;t Sigeia tellus;</L>
<L>Hic &s;teterat Priami regia cel&s;a &s;enis.</L></Q>
And what does Dr. John&s;on &s;ay on this occa&s;ion? Nothing. And what does Mr. Farmer &s;ay on this occa&s;ion? Nothing.</P>
<P>In Love's Labour's Lo&s;t, which, bad as it is, is a&s;cribed by Dr. John&s;on him&s;elf to Shake&s;peare, there occurs the word <HI>thra&s;onical</HI>; another argument which &s;eems to &s;hew that he was not unacquainted with the comedies of Terence; not to mention, that the character of the Schoolma&s;ter in the &s;ame play could not po&s;&s;ibly be written by a man who had tra|velled no further in Latin than <HI>hic, haec, hoc.</HI></P>
<P>In Henry the Sixth we meet with a quotation from Virgil,
<Q><L>Tantaene animis coele&s;tibus irae?</L></Q>
But this, it &s;eems, proves nothing, any more than the lines from Terence and Ovid, in the Taming of the Shrew; for Mr. Farmer looks on Shake|&s;peare's property in the comedy to be extremely di&s;|putable; and he has no doubt but Henry the Sixth had the &s;ame author with Edward the Third, which hath been recovered to the world in Mr. Capell's Prolu&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="181">If any play in the collection bears internal evi|dence of Shake&s;peare's hand, we may fairly give him <HI>Timon of Athens.</HI> In this play we have a fami|liar quotation from Horace,
<Q><L>Ira furor brevis e&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>I will not maintain but this hemi&s;tich may be found in Lilly or Udall; or that it is not in the <HI>Palace of Plea&s;ure,</HI> or the <HI>Engli&s;h Plutarch</HI>; or that it was not originally foi&s;ted in by the players: I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tands, however, in the play of <HI>Timon of Athens.</HI></P>
<P>The world in general, and tho&s;e who purpo&s;e to comment on Shake&s;peare in particular, will owe much to Mr. Farmer, who&s;e re&s;earches into our old authors throw a lu&s;tre on many pa&s;&s;ages, the ob|&s;curity of which mu&s;t el&s;e have been impenetrable. No future Upton or Gildon will go further than North's tran&s;lation for Shake&s;peare's acquaintance with Plutarch, or balance between Dares Phrygius, and <HI>the Troye booke of Lydgate. The Hy&s;torie of Ham|blet,</HI> in <HI>black letter,</HI> will for ever &s;uper&s;ede Saxo Grammaticus; tran&s;lated novels and ballads will, perhaps, be allowed the &s;ources of Romeo, Lear, and the Merchant of Venice; and Shake&s;peare him|&s;elf, however unlike Bayes in other particulars, will
<PB N="177" REF="182">
&s;tand convicted of having <HI>tran&s;ver&s;ed</HI> the pro&s;e of Holing&s;head; and at the &s;ame time, to prove <Q REND="inline">"that his <HI>&s;tudies</HI> lay in his own language,"</Q> the tran&s;la|tions of Ovid are determined to be the production of Heywood.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"That his <HI>&s;tudies</HI> were mo&s;t demon&s;tratively confined to <HI>nature,</HI> and his <HI>own language,</HI>"</Q> I readily allow: but does it hence follow that he was &s;o de|plorably ignorant of every other tongue, living or dead, that he only <Q REND="inline">"remembered, perhaps, enough of his <HI>&s;choolboy</HI> learning to put the <HI>hig, hag, hog,</HI> into the mouth of Sir H. Evans; and might pick up in the writers of the time, or the cour&s;e of his conver&s;ation, a familiar phra&s;e or two of French or Italian?"</Q> In Shake&s;peare's plays both the&s;e la&s;t languages are plentifully &s;cattered: but then, we are told, they might be impertinent addi|tions of the players. Undoubtedly they might: but there they are, and, perhaps, few of the players had much more learning than Shake&s;peare.</P>
<P>Mr. Farmer him&s;elf will allow that Shake&s;peare began to learn Latin: I will allow that his <HI>&s;tudies</HI> lay in Engli&s;h: but why in&s;i&s;t that he neither made any progre&s;s at &s;chool; nor improved his acqui&s;i|tions there? The general encomiums of Suckling,

<P>Dr. Warburton is certainly right in his &s;uppo|&s;ition that <HI>Florio</HI> is meant by the character of <HI>Holofernes.

<P>On reading the above note I confe&s;s that I did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult Towers's Panegy|rick on Cartwright, taking it for granted, on the E&s;&s;ayi&s;t's note, that Towers had applied the line to the &s;ubject of his panegyrick, as Jon&s;on had done before him; and yet I cannot even after this frank conce&s;&s;ion account for Dr. Farmer's triumph on &s;o &s;light a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, that does not at all affect the main que&s;tion, or e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of the various reading.

<P>From this quotation it will not only appear that I have at length con&s;ulted the panegyrick on Cart|wright, but that when <HI>talking without book,</HI> I had <HI>not &s;o &s;trangely mi&s;repre&s;ented the Doctor's argument from it.</HI> His own note to the fir&s;t edition of his E&s;&s;ay certainly tended to countenance the various reading of <Q REND="inline">"<HI>&s;mall</HI> Latin and <HI>no</HI> Greek,"</Q> by the adop|tion of the line by Towers. His Comment on the Appendix implies, either from my wilfulne&s;s or carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, <HI>a mi&s;repre&s;entation of his argument</HI>; but &s;urely, whether Towers applied the di&s;puted line to Cartwright, or his &s;uppo&s;ed Rivals in the Drama, was of no real con&s;equence: though by the by his adoption contains more various readings than one; and yet the te&s;timony of Ben Jon&s;on, on which I grounded my opinion, remains unimpeached.

<HEAD>REMARKS OR SHYLOCK's REPLY TO THE SENATE OF VENICE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few pa&s;&s;ages in the plays of Shake&s;peare, that have been more repeat|edly the &s;ubject of critical animadver&s;ion than a part of Shylock's reply to the Duke and the Magnificos in the Merchant of Venice.</P>
<P>The lines in que&s;tion in the &s;econd folio, which now lies before me, run thus: and the &s;econd folio is, I believe, in this in&s;tance, an exact tran&s;cript of the fir&s;t.<Q><L>Some men there are love not a gaping pigge;</L>
<L>Some that are madde, if they behold a cat:</L>
<L><PB N="190" REF="195">And others, when the bagpipe &s;ings i'th' no&s;e,</L>

<L>Mai&s;ters of pa&s;&s;ion &s;wayes it to the moode,</L>
<L>Of what it likes or loaths.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Rowe, the fir&s;t modern Editor, him&s;elf a Poet, willing I &s;uppo&s;e to pre&s;erve the poetical expre&s;&s;ion with no more violation of the text, than what was nece&s;&s;ary to reconcile it to &s;en&s;e and grammar, gives, as was his manner, without quoting any authority, the fifth and part of the &s;ixth line thus.<Q><L><HI>Ma&s;terle&s;s</HI> pa&s;&s;ion &s;ways it to the mood</L>
<L>Of what it likes or loaths.</L></Q></P>
<P>This reading, conveying a clear idea without any great violence to the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, was received and adopted by Pope, Theobald, and Hanmer.</P>
<P>Theobald however willing to &s;upport a propo&s;ed emendation of his ingenious a&s;&s;i&s;tant Dr. Thirlby, and at the &s;ame time to introduce a Comment of Warburton, &s;tarts a difficulty concerning the rela|tive <HI>it</HI> (&s;ways <HI>it</HI>) which, according to Rowe's read|ing, ea&s;ily and nece&s;&s;arily refers to the word <HI>Affec|tion</HI> in the line immediately preceding.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="196">Dr. Thirlby's emendation con&s;i&s;ted in a new mode of punctuation, by which he thus adju&s;ted the doubtful lines in the pa&s;&s;age.<Q><L>And others, when the bagpipe &s;ings i'th' no&s;e,</L>

<L><HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ways it to the mood</L>
<L>Of what it likes or loaths.</L></Q></P>
<P>Warburton, with a refined commentary, rejects the reading of Rowe, pre&s;erves the old pointing, but changes the number of the verb, reading <HI>&s;way</HI> for <HI>&s;ways. Affection,</HI> he interprets to be u&s;ed for <HI>&s;ympathy</HI>; and we learn from the &s;econd edition of Dr. Farmer's E&s;&s;ay on the Learning of Shake&s;peare, that <HI>Affection,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of <HI>&s;ym|pathy,</HI> was formerly <HI>technical,</HI> and &s;o u&s;ed by Lord Bacon, Sir Kenelm Digby, and <HI>many</HI> other writers.</P>
<P>Mr. Steevens, in his republication in 1760, of the twenty plays of Shake&s;peare fir&s;t printed in quarto, from a profe&s;&s;ed collation of four different copies of this play, entitles the Drama "The Comical Hi&s;|tory of The Merchant of Venice," and exhibits the pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion, thus<Q><L>Some men there are love not a gaping pig:</L>
<L>Some that are mad if they behold a cat;</L>
<L><PB N="192" REF="197">And others when the bagpipe &s;ings i'th' no&s;e</L>
<L>Cannot contain their urine for Affection,</L>
<L>Ma&s;ters of pa&s;&s;ion &s;wayes it to the mood</L>
<L>Of what it likes or loathes.</L></Q></P>
<P>Here the old pointing is pre&s;erved, but the &s;pelling is in general more modern than even that of the &s;e|cond folio, which was indeed an earlier publication than two of the collated quartos.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> is exactly conformable to our pre&s;ent orthography; and this noun, governing the verb that follows, is the mo&s;t material in the whole &s;entence: &s;o material indeed that in order to pre&s;erve it, the Modern Editors, while they embrace the punctuation of Thirlby, make a &s;till further devia|tion from the old copies, and, changing the number of both noun and verb, give the pa&s;&s;age thus,<Q><L>For <HI>Affections,</HI></L>
<L>Ma&s;ters of pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>&s;way</HI> it to the mood</L>
<L>Of what it likes OF loaths.</L></Q></P>
<P>This reading &s;eems to have been &s;ugge&s;ted by Sir John Hawkins.</P>
<P>Mr. Malone converting the noun <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> into a verb, and changing <HI>it</HI> into <HI>our</HI> reads thus,<Q><PB N="193" REF="198">
<L>For Affection</L>
<L><HI>Ma&s;ters our</HI> pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ways it to the mood</L>
<L>Of what, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>The patient and laborious Capel, who commenced his re&s;earches long before all the Editors &s;ince Han|mer, and yet &s;uffered tho&s;e Editors to anticipate, and almo&s;t &s;uper&s;ede his own publication, the dili|gent but tardy Capel adopts the punctuation of Thirlby, and regulates the pa&s;&s;age thus,<Q><L>For Affection,</L>
<L><HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ways it to the mood</L>
<L>Of what it likes or loaths.</L></Q></P>
<P>Capel, with his u&s;ual fidelity, gives the rejected reading <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mai&s;ters of</HI>"</Q> at the bottom of the page, and as it &s;hould &s;eem, from the principle e&s;tabli&s;hed in his Introduction, from the olde&s;t quarto. Of Capel the <HI>Variorum</HI> Editors take no notice.</P>
<P>It is remarkable al&s;o that Theobald in his note reporting Thirlby's propo&s;ed emendation, joins an a&s;teri&s;k to the word <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> referring to another various reading or conjecture,&mdash;<HI>Or</HI> MISTRESS; but whether this was the original &s;ugge&s;tion of Thirlby, or of him&s;elf, it is not ea&s;y to determine. In old books the mode of &s;pelling the word <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> often
<PB N="194" REF="199">
approaches very near to the word <HI>Mai&s;ters</HI> in the text; and Mr. Steevens, who reads <HI>Ma&s;ters,</HI> and for the &s;ake of Grammatical Concordance changes <HI>Af|fection</HI> to <HI>Affections,</HI> yet quotes a pa&s;&s;age from Othello, which though produced with another intention, yet countenances in this in&s;tance the reading of Capel.</P>
<Q>And though we have there a Sub&s;titute of mo&s;t allowed &s;ufficiency, yet <HI>Opinion,</HI> a <HI>Sovereign</HI> MIS|TRESS of Effects, throws a more &s;afe voice on you.</Q>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I cannot di&s;cover on what principle all the Editors, &s;ince Theobald and Han|mer, have followed the punctuation of Thirlby. It is impo&s;&s;ible, I think, for any reader, accu&s;tomed to the manner of our old writers, not to feel a cer|tain har&s;hne&s;s in the new regulation of the text, or indeed to doubt for a moment, that the old books gave the &s;econd line correctly, as at that time &s;poken on the &s;tage, and originally written by the Author. <HI>Cannot contain their urine for Affection.</HI> I never heard, excellent and very Shylock as he is, Mack|lin's full &s;top in the middle of this ver&s;e without a &s;hock; and the following words of the line, not only &s;often the expre&s;&s;ion, but are mo&s;t ea&s;y and
<PB N="195" REF="200">
natural. We &s;till apply the verb <HI>affect</HI> in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that Shylock here u&s;es the noun derived from it, and the &s;imple meaning of the line is, that <Q REND="inline">"Others are <HI>&s;o affected</HI> by the &s;ound of the bagpipe that they cannot contain them&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P>The mode of <HI>Affection</HI> here &s;ignified, granting the old text to be genuine, mu&s;t be <HI>Sympathy,</HI> illu&s;trated by an example oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e before enumerated; and the oppo&s;ition marked, like the <HI>hic &amp; ille</HI> of the Latin, by the words <HI>&s;ome and others</HI>; though without the two la&s;t words of the line the contra&s;t is le&s;s clear, and the effect of the bap|pipe might be a third in&s;tance of Antipathy. Thirl|by's punctuation, and Rowe's reading, each &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Affection</HI> to &s;ignify both <HI>Sympathy</HI> and <HI>Antipathy.</HI> Each Critick mu&s;t be allowed to be ingenious: &s;ome word, or phra&s;e, or line, expre&s;&s;ive of an irre|&s;i&s;tible influence over our <HI>likings</HI> and <HI>loathings,</HI> (for Shylock &s;peaks of both) as well as governing the verb <HI>&s;ways,</HI> is mo&s;t certainly the grand <HI>De&s;ideratum,</HI> the one thing requi&s;ite to regulate and explain this difficult pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age, as it &s;tands in the old books, is evidently defective or corrupt, or both, and though
<PB N="196" REF="201">
the reading <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> for <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> may remedy the corruption, and bring the noun and verb, accord|ing to the rules of Syntax, to accord with each other, &s;till there remains an imperfection in the context, which has driven the commentators, as their la&s;t re&s;ource, to a new mode of punctuation. My own method may, perhaps, appear &s;till more de&s;perate; but de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;es require de&s;perate remedies, and without &s;ome topical applications the ca&s;e under con&s;ideration is confe&s;&s;edly incurable: and I cannot well explain my&s;elf without &s;ome di&s;|&s;ection. I mu&s;t beg leave therefore to give a brief analy&s;is of Shylock's reply to the Duke, who tells him that the court recommend lenity to Anthonio, and expect a gentle an&s;wer from the pro&s;ecutor.&mdash;His an&s;wer is to this effect.</P>
<Q>I have taken a &s;olemn oath to exact the penalty on the Bond, and deny me ju&s;tice at your peril! If you demand why I prefer a pound of fle&s;h to three thou&s;and ducats, I an&s;wer, <HI>it is my humour.</HI> Or, if that an&s;wer be un&s;atisfactory; I add that there is an uncontroulable and unaccountable in|fluence, affecting the mind, predominating &s;o ab&s;olutely over the pa&s;&s;ions, as to impell them, in &s;pite of rea&s;on, and of will, acting in &s;ome
<PB N="197" REF="202">
men by <HI>Antipathy,</HI> and in others by <HI>Sympathy.</HI> There are in&s;tances of both. I am an in&s;tance of Antipathy. I abhor, I hate An|thonio: and this Hatred, this Antipathy, is the only an&s;wer that I will, or <HI>can</HI> give, why I prefer a lo&s;ing &s;uit to a lucrative compo&s;ition.</Q>
<P>This I take to be a fair ab&s;tract of Shylock's an|&s;wer, who, waving the <HI>&s;ic volo</HI> with which he follows up his oath, proceeds to defend his conduct by the example of other men, &s;ubject, like him&s;elf, to the irre&s;i&s;tible dominion of <HI>Sympathy</HI> and <HI>An|tipathy.</HI></P>
<P>On the whole therefore I conceive that the ori|ginal punctuation &s;hould be maintained, that the word <HI>Mai&s;ters</HI> in the old copies &s;hould be read <HI>Mi&s;|tre&s;s,</HI> and that the imperfection in the &s;en&s;e, accord|ing to that reading, ari&s;es from a line or two lo&s;t or dropt at the pre&s;s, in which the words <HI>Sympathy</HI> and <HI>Antipathy,</HI> &s;o congenial to the argument, had mo&s;t probably a place.</P>
<P>To &s;ubmit this opinion, and the whole of my comment, fairly to the reader, I &s;hall conclude the&s;e ob&s;ervations with a trans&s;cript of the whole &s;peech from the &s;econd folio, only introducing <HI>in</HI>
<PB N="198" REF="203">
<HI>another character</HI> the variation of <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> for <HI>Mai&s;ters,</HI> together with one intercalary line, meant (like the day in Leap-year) to complete the &s;y&s;tem, and to convey the real meaning of the author. His real words are now irrecoverable.</P>
<P>The Duke concludes the addre&s;s to Shylock, in behalf of the Senate and him&s;elf, with the&s;e words.<Q><L>We do expect a gentle an&s;wer, Jew.</L></Q></P>
<P>Shylock's an&s;wer is as follows:<Q><L>I have po&s;&s;e&s;st your Grace with what I purpo&s;e,</L>
<L>And by our holy Sabbath have I &s;worne</L>
<L>To have the due and forfet of my bond.</L>
<L>If you deny it, let the danger light</L>

<L>You'l a&s;ke me why I rather choo&s;e to have</L>

<L><PB N="199" REF="204">And I be pleas'd to give ten thou&s;and Ducates</L>
<L>To have it bain'd? What, are you an&s;wer'd yet?</L>
<L>Some men there are love not a gaping pigge:</L>
<L>Some that are madde, if they behold a cat:</L>
<L>And others, when the bagpipe &s;ings i'th' no&s;e,</L>

<L><HI>Sovereign Antipathy,</HI> or <HI>Sympathy,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;wayes it to the moode</L>

<L>Why he cannot abide a gaping pigge?</L>
<L>Why he a harmle&s;s nece&s;&s;ary cat?</L>
<L>Why he a woollen bagpipe? but of force</L>

<L>I beare Anthonio, that I follow thus</L>
<L>A loo&s;ing &s;uit again&s;t him? Are you an&s;wered?</L></Q></P>
<P>If this expo&s;ition is not convincing and conclu|&s;ive, it were in vain to add more arguments to en|force it. <HI>Valeat, quantum valere pote&s;t!</HI> The few faults in the punctuation of the old copy are &s;o ob|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ious, that they cannot mi&s;lead the attentive reader; but the defect in the con&s;truction, without addition or alteration, is irremoveable. The la&s;t expedient

having, in my humble opinion, proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, a clo&s;e con&s;ideration of the whole pa&s;&s;age &s;ugge&s;ted the former. With what propriety the reader will determine.</P>
<P>Some difficulties, for Criticks will create difficul|ties, have ari&s;en from other lines in this &s;peech. John&s;on never &s;aw a <HI>woollen</HI> bagpipe, and therefore propo&s;es to read <HI>wooden.</HI> A wooden reading, which Sir John Hawkins converts into <HI>&s;welling</HI> or <HI>&s;wollen</HI>; but though John&s;on never &s;aw a <HI>woollen</HI> bagpipe, Shake&s;peare might have &s;een one, nor is it difficult to conceive. I think I have &s;een one: the bag I mean, for the <HI>pipe,</HI> as he &s;uppo&s;es, was of wood.</P>
<P>The edition al&s;o of 1778, now under my eye, reads,

<P>The twenty plays publi&s;hed by Mr. Steevens in the year 1760, from a collation of the quartos, ex|hibit, printing more elegantly,
<Q><L>As to offend, him&s;elf being offended.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the&s;e matters of critical nicety &s;uch trifles are not unworthy of ob&s;ervation, though perhaps the

THOUGHTS ON PUBLICK EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>LOCKE, who by his intellectual re&s;earches has made his name as memorable in the annals of Engli&s;h Literature as tho&s;e of Bacon or Newton, has among other &s;maller works bequeathed to po&s;te|rity a &s;hort tract entitled "Some Thoughts con|cerning Education." In this tract, containing many excellent remarks, many in&s;tances of &s;hrewd penetration, and much valuable information, he has avowed him&s;elf a declared enemy to Publick
<PB N="206" REF="211">
Education, which he con&s;iders as a &s;acrifice of inno|cency to confidence, concluding <Q REND="inline">"that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to keep a lad from the &s;preading conta|gion, if <HI>you will venture him abroad</HI> IN THE HERD, and tru&s;t to chance or <HI>his own inclination,</HI> for the choice of his company at &s;chool."</Q></P>
<P>Who would not &s;hrink at the thoughts of en|countering &s;o formidable an adver&s;ary, armed at all points with &s;trong natural Sen&s;e, keen Ob&s;ervation, Satire, Humour, and Argument? for &s;uch weapons he has wielded, and with &s;uch armour has he de|fended him&s;elf, on the &s;ubject now under con&s;idera|tion, directing all his attacks again&s;t the principle I have undertaken to defend. Yet exerci&s;ing that freedom, of which he has him&s;elf given both the precept and example, I venture to think for my|&s;elf, and in my turn to &s;ubmit my thoughts to the Publick.</P>
<Q>Nullius addictus jurare in verba Magi&s;tri.</Q>
<P>Locke's <HI>Thoughts on Education,</HI> though publi&s;hed in one continued &s;eries, and &s;plit into &s;ections, according to the cu&s;tom of the times, is yet, as the
<PB N="207" REF="212">
dedication declares, the mere &s;ub&s;tance of a corre|&s;pondence with a private friend, and indeed may now fairly be re&s;olved into three &s;eparate letters: for the writer, at three di&s;tinct periods, reverts to the &s;tate of infancy; and twice leads the babe through child|hood to youth and manhood: this may e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of a cur&s;ory reader, but to a fair and &s;trict examiner is plain and obvious.</P>
<P>The following remarks are, like the tract on which they are founded, &s;omewhat loo&s;e and de&s;ul|tory. It is indeed very difficult to follow a writer, who often re&s;umes a &s;ubject that he &s;eems to have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: yet order and method have been endea|voured to be pre&s;erved, as far as was po&s;&s;ible under &s;uch circum&s;tances. No material part of the que&s;|tion, it is hoped, remains unnoticed: and it may be added with confidence, that no argument has been intentionally mi&s;repre&s;ented.</P>
<P><HI>Virtue, Virtue and Wi&s;dom,</HI> Locke ju&s;tly con&s;iders as the ba&s;is of all good education. They are indeed as nece&s;&s;ary to the operations of the mind, as health and vigour to the exertions of the body. We will not therefore di&s;pute on a &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition; but rather endeavour to prove, on the very principles

<P>All that Locke &s;ays of children, while children, that is while in a mere &s;tate of infancy, is in gene|ral well worth notice. He &s;eems to enter into all their little feelings with as much penetration, and much le&s;s romance, than Rou&s;&s;eau, who&s;e EMILE, with all its merit, and all its originality, is in fact an ingenious amplification of Locke's work, reali&s;|ing in him&s;elf the ideal character of the tutor or governor, and in <HI>Emile</HI> the per&s;on of the pupil, whom he takes up from his cradle, and carries to his mar|riage bed, ju&s;t as Locke advi&s;es, on his return from Late Travel. Rou&s;&s;eau's work however is not merely the little tract of Locke dilated and per&s;oni|fied, but in many in&s;tances a comment; &s;ometimes too laboured and refined, and &s;ometimes acute and plau&s;ible. Few will agree with him that in&s;truction mu&s;t be delayed till the le&s;&s;ons can be attended with experiment, or think it rea&s;onable to refer their little &s;tudents to the open volume of nature, denying them the u&s;e of books, maps, globes, and other helps which Locke recommends. Mo&s;t parents would think Locke's method of teaching Geography as prudent as it is &s;imple and ea&s;y, by &s;hewing children fir&s;t the figure and natural parts of the globe, and
<PB N="210" REF="215">
the imaginary and artificial lines afterwards: but Rou&s;&s;eau de&s;pi&s;es &s;uch in&s;ufficient methods, throws away maps and &s;pheres, and by his own example exhorts teachers to carry their &s;cholars at different &s;ea&s;ons to the top of a mountain, to &s;ee the &s;un ri&s;e at Mid&s;ummer and at Chri&s;tmas. This appears ra|ther extravagant, but, at the &s;ame time, it may be thought that Rou&s;&s;eau properly cen&s;ures Locke's maxim of <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> with children, which he truly &s;ays Locke him&s;elf appears &s;o much embarra&s;&s;ed to defend. With equal ju&s;tice he reprobates Locke's method of recommending and encouraging LIBE|RALITY, <Q REND="inline">"con&s;tantly <HI>taking care that the child lo&s;es nothing by it.</HI>"</Q> Let all the in&s;tances he gives of <Q REND="inline">"&s;uch freene&s;s (continues Locke) <HI>be always repaid and with intere&s;t,</HI> and let him &s;en&s;ibly perceive that the kindne&s;s he &s;hews to others, is no bad hu&s;bandry for him&s;elf; but that it brings a return of kindne&s;s both from tho&s;e who receive it, and tho&s;e who look on!"</Q> This, &s;ays Rou&s;&s;eau, is to teach a child to be generous to appearance, and in reality avaricious. He reprehends al&s;o Locke's opi|nion that <Q REND="inline">"the con&s;ideration of <HI>&s;pirits</HI> ought to go before that of matter and body:"</Q> for what idea, &s;ays he, can a child entertain of a being incorporeal and immaterial?</P>

<P>Locke, while he &s;o openly and &s;everely cen&s;ures Publick Education, &s;lurs over the defects of do|me&s;tick tuition, yet his &s;ubject unavoidably leads him to point out &s;ome imperfections; and particu|larly the danger <HI>from &s;ervants:</HI> to which might be added the too frequent hereditary taint of the mind from the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, and the contagion of their friends and acquaintance.

<P>The chief officer in Locke's hou&s;ehold of private education is a Governour, or Tutor; <Q REND="inline">"and if you find it difficult (&s;ays he) to meet with &s;uch a tutor, you are not to wonder."</Q></P>
<P>His de&s;cription of a Tutor is indeed chimerical. Wi&s;dom, temperance, tenderne&s;s, diligence, and di&s;cretion, are the lead e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites in the character of Locke's governour. Such a man as he delineates is &s;carce to be found; and if found, would hardly undertake the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned him.</P>
<P>His <HI>learning however,</HI> much or little, is no great recommendation. <Q REND="inline">"That a tutor &s;hould have <HI>Latin and learning,</HI> with the reputation of &s;obriety, every one expects: and this generally is thought enough, and is all parents look for.

<P><PB N="214" REF="219">Such is the deri&s;ion be&s;towed by Locke on the <HI>&s;cholar&s;hip</HI> of a tutor; and &s;uch is his con&s;tant con|tempt of literature and erudition, under the &s;neering denominations of <HI>Latin and learning, a deal of tra&s;h, dry &s;y&s;tems, &amp;c.</HI> which appears very &s;trange from a learned, or, as Locke &s;tyles him&s;elf, a <HI>booki&s;h man.</HI> He not only gives the fir&s;t place to <HI>virtue,</HI> without "which no &s;cience, polite learning, or talents, can be of value, but much prefers <HI>breeding</HI> to learning.

<Q>The Tutor therefore ought IN THE FIRST PLACE TO BE WELL BRED? And a young gentleman who gets this ONE qualification from his GOVERNOR, &s;ets out with great advantage; and will find that THIS

ONE ACCOMPLISHMENT will more open his way to him, get him more friends, and carry him farther in the world, than all the HARD WORDS, OR REAL KNOWLEDGE he has got from the liberal arts, or his TUTOR'S learned ENCYCLOPOEDIA.

<P><HI>Knowledge of the world</HI> al&s;o is deemed preferable to <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>languages,</HI> though by the way, he here inadvertently implies the &s;uperior force of Pub|lick Education, and is obliged to confe&s;s that the &s;tudy of the antients contributes both to that <HI>know|ledge</HI> and to <HI>virtue.</HI> The Tutor however, this &s;age and exemplary monitor, de&s;cribed by Locke, mu&s;t enter his pupil into the world, and at the &s;ame time pre&s;erve him, like the Four Thieves, Vinegar, from the contagion of &s;ociety; &s;o that a youth mu&s;t, it &s;eems, after all encounter the danger &s;o much dreaded in a Publick Education, the danger of herding with tho&s;e of his own time of life: and how ill he may be prepared to hazard his morals, his health, and his fortune, in &s;uch company, the following picture of many a lad mewed up in a private family, drawn by the ma&s;terly hand of Locke him&s;elf, will exhibit in the mo&s;t lively colours.</P>

Among&s;t which, there will not be wanting &s;ome birds of prey that will pre&s;ently be on the wing for him.</Q>
<P>The Tutor however is not to neglect our young ma&s;ter's learning, but is to teach him Latin, like French, by <HI>talking</HI> it into him in con&s;tant conver&s;a|tion; for he mu&s;t be con&s;tantly with his pupil, talk nothing el&s;e to him, and make him &s;till an&s;wer in the &s;ame language; though perhaps the compari&s;on is not quite fair and appo&s;ite, French being a living language and Latin a dead one.

And when &s;he under&s;tands the Evangeli&s;ts in LATIN, let her in the &s;ame manner, read AESOP's FABLES, and &s;o proceed on to EUTROPIUS, JUSTIN, and other &s;uch books.

In the lower cla&s;&s;es of Publick Schools mo&s;t of the boys are, during the intervals of the &s;chool hours, under the care of one of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants retained, at a very moderate co&s;t, as a private tutor.

that nobody talks and &s;hould pretend to write, is as little eligible as it is fea&s;ible; and his &s;ub&s;tituted method of <HI>interlining Latin and Engli&s;h,</HI> while it re|quires, according to his own confe&s;&s;ion, a previous explanation of the various terminations of nouns and verbs, their &s;everal genders, ca&s;es, numbers and per&s;ons, proves the nece&s;&s;ity of the rules of Grammar, while it deprives the little &s;tudents of the u&s;e of them. The re&s;ult mu&s;t be perpetual con|fu&s;ion, ari&s;ing from &s;uperficial in&s;tructions, and a total impo&s;&s;ibility of cultivating even their mother tongue, as he afterwards very properly, though in|con&s;i&s;tently with his own doctrine, recommends. Engli&s;h it&s;elf &s;hould be taught by Grammar, though by natives fir&s;t acquired by rote, cu&s;tom, and me|mory. The mother tongue is almo&s;t &s;ucked in with the mother's milk.</P>

<P>This pa&s;&s;age is quite of a piece with every other in which Locke mentions Publick Education, on which occa&s;ion he not only, as he him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es, lo&s;es his temper, but al&s;o drops his u&s;ual liberality and candour. <Q REND="inline">"I cannot with patience think, (he cries in another place) that a young gentleman &s;hould be put into the herd, and be driven with a whip and &s;courge, as if he were to run the gantlet through the different cla&s;&s;es <HI>ad capiendum ingenii cultum.</HI>"</Q> At other times he terms &s;uch youths <HI>ill bred and vicious boys, a mixed herd of unruly boys, learning to wrangle at trap, or rook at &s;hun-farthing, practi&s;ing wagferies and cheats, and con|certing well laid plots of robbing an orchard.</HI></P>

<Q>This I think is &s;ufficiently evident, that chil|dren generally hate to be idle. All the care then is, that their bu&s;ie humour &s;hould be con&s;tantly employed in &s;omething of u&s;e to them, which, if you will attain, you mu&s;t make what you would have them do a <HI>recreation</HI> to them, and not a <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> The way to do this, &s;o that they may not perceive you have any hand in it is this pro|po&s;ed here; <HI>viz.</HI> To make them weary of that which you would not have them do, by enjoyn|ing, and making them, under &s;ome pretence or other do it, till they are &s;urfeited. For example: does your &s;on play at top or &s;courge too much? Enjoin him to play &s;o many hours every day, <HI>and look that he do it</HI>; and you &s;hall &s;ee he will quick|ly be &s;ick of it, and willing to leave it. By this

means making the recreations you di&s;like a <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> to him, he will of him&s;elf with delight betake him&s;elf to tho&s;e things you would have him do; e&s;peci|ally if they be propo&s;ed as rewards for having per|formed his <HI>ta&s;k</HI> in that play is commanded him. For if he be ordered every day to whip his top &s;o long as to make him &s;ufficiently weary, do you not think he will apply him&s;elf with eagerne&s;s to his book, and wi&s;h for it, if you promi&s;e it him as a reward for having whipped his top lu&s;tily, quite out all the time that is &s;et him? Children, in the things they do, if they comport with their age, find little difference &s;o they may be doing. The e&s;teem they have for one thing above another they borrow from others. So that what tho&s;e about them make to be a reward to them, will really be &s;o. By this art it is in their governour's choice; whether <HI>Scotch-hoppers</HI> &s;hall reward their <HI>dancing,</HI> or <HI>dancing</HI> their <HI>Scotch-hoppers</HI>; whether peg-top, or reading, playing at trap, or &s;tudying the globes, &s;hall be more acceptable and plea&s;ing to them. All that they de&s;ire being to be bu&s;ie and bu&s;ie, as they imagine, in things of their own choice, and which they receive as favours from their parents, or others for whom they have re|&s;pect, and with whom they would be in credit.

And the elde&s;t being thus entered, and this made the fa&s;hion of the place, it would be as impo&s;&s;ible to hinder them from learning the one, as it is ordinarily to keep them from the other.</Q>
<P>The&s;e extracts will perhaps convince mo&s;t readers of the vi&s;ionary pro&s;pects pre&s;ented to parental <HI>ima|ginations</HI> in many a <HI>practical treati&s;e</HI> on Private Edu|cation. Several pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ame nature occur in the tract now under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>One of the ready topicks of Locke's cen&s;ure and raillery of Publick Schools is the <HI>correction</HI> occa|&s;ionally be&s;towed on idle, irregular, or ob&s;tinate pupils. But &s;ay what he will of the u&s;e of the <HI>rod</HI> to la&s;h dull boys into nouns and pronouns, verbs, gerunds, and &s;upines, it is rarely exerci&s;ed by a good Schoolma&s;ter but when <HI>wilfulne&s;s</HI> or <HI>ill example</HI> de|mands it: on which occa&s;ions the <HI>continued</HI> &s;everities enjoined by Locke much exceed the utmo&s;t rigours of Publick Education. As for example!</P>
<Q><PB N="229" REF="234"><HI>I would have a</HI> father &s;eldom &s;trike his child, <HI>but upon very urgent nece&s;&s;ity and as the la&s;t remedy;</HI> and then perhaps it will be fit to do it &s;o, that the child &s;hould not quickly forget it.</Q>
<P>And again.</P>
<Q><HI>Whenever you come to that extremity, it is not enough to whip or beat them, you mu&s;t do it, till you find you have &s;ubdued their minds, till with &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion and patience they yield to the correction; which you &s;hall be&s;t di&s;cover by their crying and their cea&s;ing from it upon your bidding.</HI> Without this the beat|ing of children is but a pa&s;&s;ionate tyranny over them; and it is mere cruelty and not correction to put their bodies in pain without doing their minds any good. As this gives us a rea&s;on why children &s;hould &s;eldom be corrected, &s;o it al&s;o prevents their being &s;o. For if whenever they are cha&s;ti&s;ed it were done thus without pa&s;&s;ion, &s;oberly and yet e&s;&s;entially too, <HI>laying on the blows and &s;mart, not furiou&s;ly and all at once, but &s;lowly with rea&s;oning between, and with ob&s;ervation how it wrought, &s;topping when it had made them pliant, pe|nitent, and yielding</HI>; they would &s;eldom need the like puni&s;hment again, being made careful to avoid the fault, that de&s;erved it. Be&s;ides, by this
<PB N="230" REF="235">
means as <HI>the puni&s;hment would not be lo&s;t for being too little and not effectual,</HI> &s;o it would be kept from being too much, <HI>if we gave off as &s;oon as we per|ceived that it reached the mind, and that was bettered.</HI> For &s;ince the chiding or beating of children &s;hould be always the lea&s;t that po&s;&s;ibly may be, that which is laid on in the heat of anger, &s;eldom ob&s;erves that mea&s;ure, but is commonly more than it &s;hould be, though it proves <HI>le&s;s than enough.</HI></Q>
<P>The circum&s;tance of <HI>laying on the blows with rea|&s;oning between</HI> exhibits a whim&s;ical picture, and re|minds one of the pedagogue of Swift concluding every period with a la&s;h. And the idea of perceiv|ing the very moment, when the cure on the mind is effected by the operation on the tail, is &s;till more ludicrous. The young patient however might per|haps wi&s;h to remind the author of another pa&s;&s;age in an early &s;ection of this tract, there applied to the regimen of the body, but not inapplicable on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<Q>When &s;uch a gentle treatment will not &s;top the growing mi&s;chief, nor hinder it from turning into a formed di&s;ea&s;e, it will be time to &s;eek the advice of &s;ome &s;ober and di&s;creet phy&s;ician. In this part I hope I &s;hall find an ea&s;y belief; and
<PB N="231" REF="236">
nobody can have a pretence to doubt the advice of one who has &s;pent &s;ome time in the &s;tudy of Phy|&s;ick when he coun&s;els you, <HI>not to be too forward in making u&s;e of</HI> PHYSICK OR PHYSICIANS.</Q>
<P>I am unwilling to load the page with too many quotations; but as the following is peculiarly in|tere&s;ting and entertaining, I flatter my&s;elf the reader will &s;carce think it demands an apology.</P>
<Q><HI>A prudent and kind mother</HI> of my acquaintance, was on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, forced to whip her little daughter, at her fir&s;t coming home from nur&s;e, <HI>eight times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the &s;ame morning</HI> before &s;he could ma&s;ter her <HI>&s;tubbornne&s;s,</HI> and obtain a com|pliance in a very ea&s;y and indifferent manner. <HI>If &s;he had left off &s;ooner, and &s;topped at the &s;eventh whipping, &s;he had &s;poiled the child for ever</HI>; and by her unprevailing blows, only confirmed her <HI>refractorine&s;s</HI> very hardly afterwards to be cured. But wi&s;ely per&s;i&s;ting till &s;he had bent her mind, and &s;uppled her will, the only end of correction and cha&s;ti&s;ement, &s;he e&s;tabli&s;hed her authority thoroughly in the very fir&s;t occa&s;ion, and had ever after a very ready compliance and obedience in all things from her daughter. For as this was the
<PB N="232" REF="237">
fir&s;t time, &s;o <HI>I think it was the la&s;t too</HI> &s;he ever &s;truck her.</Q>
<P>Correction, when nece&s;&s;ary; is certainly le&s;s pain|ful both to parents and children, when inflicted abroad than at home. It is better that fathers &s;hould &s;eem uncon&s;cious of the knowledge of all their petty tre&s;pa&s;&s;es; and Locke, though he here &s;o much commends the repeated flagellations of <HI>a little daugh|ter by a prudent</HI> and <HI>kind mother,</HI> yet in the &s;ection fir&s;t quoted declares, <Q REND="inline">"I think it is be&s;t the <HI>&s;mart</HI> &s;hould come more immediately <HI>from another's hand,</HI> though by the parent's order <HI>who &s;hould &s;ee it done.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>In confirmation of the lenity of ma&s;ters of Pub|lick Schools, I &s;hall venture to mention a little anecdote that came within my own knowledge, during the time of my education at We&s;tmin&s;ter. A gentleman, not long &s;ince living, was when a &s;chool-boy more di&s;tingui&s;hed by the goodne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, than the brilliancy of his parts. Many of the forms, u&s;ually committed to the care of a&s;&s;i&s;tants, were however now and then vi&s;ited by the head ma&s;ter. On one of the&s;e occa&s;ions, the gentleman I have &s;poken of was called out by Dr. Nicoll, to read and con&s;true a part of the le&s;&s;on to
<PB N="233" REF="238">
the form; which, being in the upper &s;chool, the le&s;&s;on of the day was in Greek. The hone&s;t lad, con&s;cious of his inability, obeyed the call: but in|&s;tead of attempting the le&s;&s;on, went up to the ma&s;ter, and muttered indi&s;tinctly, <HI>Flog me, Sir!</HI>&mdash;Speak out, child! &s;ays the ma&s;ter.&mdash;<HI>Flog me Sir, if you plea&s;e!</HI> repeats the &s;cholar, dropping his book and unbutton|ing. The ma&s;ter, with a cha&s;ti&s;ed &s;mile, laying his hand on his young pupil's head, and gently patting him, cried in a mild tone, Go thy ways, boy! get thee to thy place again! Thou art a very hone&s;t fel|low, but thou never wilt be a Scholar as long as thou live&s;t.</P>
<P>This &s;tory may &s;erve as a companion to Locke's pictures of private correction, and may &s;erve to &s;hew that good hearts may be found in Publick Schools as well as private families; and that the di&s;cipline of <HI>the rod</HI> is not admini&s;tered with more judicious di&s;crimination in one &s;y&s;tem of education than the other.</P>
<P>The <HI>rewards</HI> al&s;o are at Publick Schools as well cho&s;en and as appropriated as the <HI>puni&s;hments</HI>; the latter exhibiting, as Locke enjoins, the <HI>di&s;grace,</HI> and the former adding to the <HI>reputation</HI> of the young
<PB N="234" REF="239">
&s;tudent. The little &s;hining coin of pennies, two-pences, threepences, and groats <HI>in &s;ilver,</HI> given on any occa&s;ional di&s;play of indu&s;try or excellence, are as triumphantly prized and carefully trea&s;ured by the young receiver, as a medal by an antiquarian; and are carefully carried home, with joy and pride, as pledges of their merit in their cla&s;s, and tokens of the approbation of their ma&s;ter. A &s;till higher mark of favour is the &s;ea&s;onable reward of di&s;tingui&s;hing the diligence and abilities of a ri&s;ing lad by promo|tion in the &s;chool, and anticipating his remove to a &s;uperior form. Places and preferments are often gained at We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Emulation,</HI> that great &s;pur to improvement, almo&s;t unknown in Dome&s;tick Tuition, is greatly encouraged in the field of Publick Education. This Locke him&s;elf acknowledges. The cu&s;tom of <HI>challenging,</HI> as it is termed by the &s;chool boys, promotes a won|derful de&s;ire of excelling among&s;t young champions for literary pre-eminence. This <HI>challenging</HI> is thus ordered, and proves a keen incitement to diligence and perfection. The boys of the form are called out to their le&s;&s;on of the day. The fir&s;t boy per|haps mi&s;con&s;trues his Ae&s;op or Ovid, the &s;econd corrects his mi&s;take and takes his rank and place;
<PB N="235" REF="240">
or, the &s;econd failing, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the &s;ixth, or the &s;ixteenth, in due order gives the right con&s;truction, and &s;uper&s;edes all his &s;chool-fellows of the cla&s;s under examination; &s;o that a boy is often tran&s;ported in a moment from the lower or <HI>fag</HI> end to the very top of the form. As the young &s;tudents advance towards the &s;uperior forms, this practice, in re&s;pect to their maturer years and progre&s;s in their &s;tudies, is judiciou&s;ly di&s;con|tinued.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak of the cu&s;tom of Publick Schools, I particularly refer to that of We&s;tmin&s;ter, where I was bred, and with who&s;e cu&s;toms I am be&s;t ac|quainted, not que&s;tioning that other Publick Schools have equal advantages.</P>
<P><HI>Ver&s;es</HI> and <HI>Themes,</HI> &s;o reprobated by Locke, are intended as exerci&s;es to teach &s;cholars better to un|der&s;tand the poetical and pro&s;e compo&s;itions of the antients, and not meant, as he in&s;inuates, to render every &s;cholar a <HI>poet</HI> or <HI>declaimer.</HI> The various mea|&s;ures of poetry are more ea&s;ily comprehended, and more perfectly read, by tho&s;e who reduce the rules of pro&s;ody to practice. For this purpo&s;e metrical centoes, ludicrou&s;ly &s;tyled <HI>jointed dolls,</HI> fitting the end of one line to the beginning or middle of another;
<PB N="236" REF="241">
and even <HI>non&s;en&s;e ver&s;es,</HI> have their u&s;e. For unle&s;s Virgil and Horace are to be prohibited to Engli&s;h pupils, like the Bible to Roman Catholicks, tho&s;e who &s;tudy them &s;hould be in&s;tructed to read them with propriety, not conceiving that they are to be|come Virgils and Horaces them&s;elves. <HI>Themes</HI> tend to open the mind, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly be prejudi|cial. To explain the <HI>the&s;is</HI> to the young &s;tudents is no more ridiculous than the other helps which Locke him&s;elf not only allows, but even pre&s;cribes to be given for the improvement of his pupils. Milton, as well as Locke, objects to <HI>themes and ver&s;es</HI> as &s;chool exerci&s;es, <Q REND="inline">"forcing the empty wits of children to acts of ripe&s;t judgment, and the final work of a head filled, by long reading and ob&s;erving, with elegant maxims, and copious in|vention."</Q> But &s;urely &s;uch objections deny to the improvement and cultivation of the mind, the means nece&s;&s;arily u&s;ed and recommended in the exerci&s;es of the body. <HI>Nec literas didicit nec natare</HI> was, as Locke ob&s;erves, a proverb to denote an ill and imperfect education. It were as con&s;i&s;tent therefore to &s;ay that a lad mu&s;t not go into the water till he can &s;wim, as to forbid all attempts at compo&s;ition, till he has acquired and formed a &s;tyle which de|pends &s;o much, like per&s;onal grace and activity, upon
<PB N="237" REF="242">
practice. Fal&s;e concords and fal&s;e quantities, re|proved and amended, guide the learner by degrees to true pro&s;ody and &s;yntax. <HI>Barbarizing anglici&s;ms,</HI> &s;o offen&s;ive to Milton, lead to pure latinity. <Q REND="inline">"An art, &s;ays Bu&s;by, is the way of doing a thing &s;urely, readily, and gracefully,"</Q> Grammar is the art of &s;peaking and writing: and was that or any other art ever attained without repeated efforts, lead|ing by in&s;en&s;ible gradations through error to per|fection? The Latin pieces of ver&s;e and pro&s;e of Milton now extant were derived no doubt from long reading and ob&s;erving. His <HI>Juvenilia,</HI> admirable as they are, were certainly preceded by more puerile exerci&s;es and imperfect compo&s;itions.</P>
<Q>Didicit prius, extimuitque magi&s;trum.</Q>
<P><HI>Repetitions by heart</HI> are no more than &s;electing, as Locke him&s;elf directs, the beautiful pa&s;&s;ages from authors, and impre&s;&s;ing them on the memory of the reciter. They &s;hould not it is true (and they are not) be too long, nor too frequently exacted: yet &s;uch exerci&s;es undoubtedly &s;erve to &s;trengthen the memory; for every faculty of the mind, as well as every limb of the body, acquires vigour from u&s;e and exertion. If <HI>players,</HI> whom Locke &s;arca&s;tically
<PB N="238" REF="243">
in&s;tances, have not all of them the be&s;t memories in the world, every player perhaps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that fa|culty in a greater degree, than if he had not been called upon to the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of it in his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Greek</HI> ought not to be excluded, as Locke &s;eems to exclude it, from a young gentleman's education. If languages are to be learnt &s;o ea&s;ily and &s;o readily, as Locke a&s;&s;erts, Greek in particular ought not to be omitted; and if tho&s;e who have been initiated in that language do generally, as he &s;ays, &s;eldom after|wards make any proficiency, how can it be expected that they who have not learnt even the rudiments as boys, &s;hould attain that language, when men? This however is his method and propo&s;al. Give then rather in the cour&s;e of their education the power and po&s;&s;ibility of becoming adepts! (for this is all that can be done by education) and you have di&s;|charged your duty. Every &s;cholar, who makes a very con&s;iderable progre&s;s in any language, art, or &s;cience, is chiefly his own ma&s;ter. <HI>Greek</HI> is at lea&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary and ornamental to a gentleman, as a <HI>trade</HI> &s;o earne&s;tly recommended by Locke, and full as polite and beneficial an accompli&s;hment as the art of perfumery, varni&s;hing, graving, working in
<PB N="239" REF="244">
iron, bra&s;s, or &s;ilver, cutting or &s;etting of pre|cious &s;tones, or even grinding and poli&s;hing optical gla&s;&s;es!</P>
<P>Rou&s;&s;eau is particularly partial to the occupation of a <HI>joiner,</HI> one of the trades recommended by Locke, and takes notice, with an air of triumph, that the Czar Peter exerci&s;ed the employment of a &s;hip's carpenter! As to &s;tudy, he denies his pupil all books, except Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe.</P>
<P><HI>Hardine&s;s,</HI> &s;o &s;trongly recommended by Locke, is much more likely to be obtained in a Publick School than at home, where the ill-judged tender|ne&s;s of the parents, of mamas e&s;pecially, often pro|duces effeminacy, which expo&s;es the little ma&s;ter to the ridicule of all his Schoolfellows.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>Sheepi&s;h &s;oftne&s;s</HI> (it is allowed by Locke) often enervates tho&s;e who are bred like foplings, at home."</Q> He owns too on another occa&s;ion that <Q REND="inline">"it is <HI>not unu&s;ual</HI> to ob&s;erve the children of gentle|men's families treat the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e with domineering words, names of contempt, and an imperious carriage: as if they were of another race, and &s;pecies beneath them."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="245">Other vices and weakne&s;&s;es may al&s;o be learnt in the parlour, the kitchen, and the &s;table. Of the contagion from a train of vicious dome&s;ticks Locke him&s;elf always appears extremely &s;en&s;ible. In one place his words are the&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"They frequently learn from unbred or debauched &s;ervants untowardly tricks and vices, as otherwi&s;e they po&s;&s;ibly would be ignorant of all their lives."</Q></P>
<P>Locke well ob&s;erves that <Q REND="inline">"the peculiar <HI>phy&s;iog|nomy of the mind</HI> is mo&s;t di&s;coverable in children, before cunning hath taught them to hide defor|mities and conceal their ill inclinations under a di&s;&s;embled out&s;ide."</Q></P>
<P>Publick Education is infinitely better calculated than Dome&s;tick Tuition for the di&s;covery of the natural features of the mind. If a boy wears a ma&s;k, his Schoolfellows will be &s;ure to tear it off, and betray his real di&s;po&s;ition to general ob&s;ervation; and indeed I &s;carce remember a &s;ingle in&s;tance of a lad bred in a great &s;chool, who did not retain &s;trong traces of his puerile character all his life after. <HI>The fir&s;t &s;cenes of his life</HI> therefore, to u&s;e Locke's own words, are be&s;t acted on a Publick Stage, where his <HI>predominant pa&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>prevailing inclina|tions</HI> being more open and expo&s;ed, are mo&s;t capable
<PB N="241" REF="246">
of correction. His very &s;choolfellows become ma&s;ters in this in&s;tance; for youth commonly in|clines to the benignant and generous &s;ide.</P>
<P>In regard to <HI>morals</HI> and <HI>religion,</HI> tho&s;e great and important con&s;iderations, if it is duly weighed that the mo&s;t nice and dangerous part of human life occurs between the commencement and conclu&s;ion of the period de&s;tined to education, it is not won|derful that publick &s;chool-boys, as well as private pupils, &s;hould &s;ometimes be found to be defective or culpable. The &s;ap will ri&s;e in the &s;pring, blights will &s;trike the noble&s;t plant, and fro&s;ts will nip the faire&s;t flower: all that can be &s;ugge&s;ted by art is whole&s;ome manure, and providently to fence and guard again&s;t the heat or inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on. In publick &s;chools the duties of religion are by no means neglected. All that Locke enjoins is duly taught. The exerci&s;es of Saturday evening, and the le&s;&s;ons of Monday morning, are from the Bible and Prayer book. The daily bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;chool begins, like that of the Hou&s;e of Commons, with reading prayers. One of the &s;enior boys officiates as chaplain, and the prayers are in Latin. Even the Sacrament is at a proper age admini&s;tered to the young di&s;ciples; and I have witne&s;&s;ed, among&s;t
<PB N="242" REF="247">
tho&s;e early communicants, a &s;olemnity of prepara|tion and reception, that would have done them honour at any &s;ucceeding period of their lives.</P>
<P>Locke, with an air of a&s;&s;umed candour towards the ma&s;ter of a &s;chool introduces the following ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<Q>The difference is great between two or three pupils in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and three or four&s;core boys lodged up and down. For let the ma&s;ter's indu&s;try and &s;kill be never &s;o great, it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have fifty or one hundred &s;cholars under his eye any longer than they are in &s;chool together: nor can it be expected that he &s;hould in&s;truct them &s;ucce&s;sfully in any thing but their books. The forming of their minds and manners, requiring a con&s;tant attention and particular application to every &s;ingle boy, which is impo&s;&s;ible in a numerous flock, and would be wholly in vain (could he have time to &s;tudy and correct every one's particular defects and wrong inclinations) when the lad was to be left to him&s;elf, or the prevailing infection of his fellows, the greate&s;t part of the four and twenty hours.</Q>
<P>The ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of <HI>a con&s;tant application and particular attention to every &s;ingle boy,</HI> and it
<PB N="243" REF="248">
may be added the doubt whether &s;uch particular at|tention would not rather injure than benefit the pupil by encouraging his &s;elf-importance, together with many other obvious difficulties, oblige Locke him&s;elf at la&s;t to confe&s;s, as has before been no|ticed, <Q REND="inline">"what &s;hall be re&s;olved in this ca&s;e mu&s;t in a great mea&s;ure be left to the parents to be deter|mined by their circum&s;tances and conveniences."</Q> But not to take advantage of &s;uch a reluctant con|ce&s;&s;ion, let us rather recommend to the ma&s;ter of a great &s;chool, to keep a watchful eye on the conduct of the boys during the intervals of the &s;chool hours, and carefully by him&s;elf and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants to vi&s;it and regulate the boarding hou&s;es. The ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e hou&s;es mu&s;t &s;ubmit to his direc|tions, or abandon their employments: for what parent would commit his &s;on to a family &s;uppo&s;ed to be adver&s;e to the general di&s;cipline of the &s;chool; and who&s;e inmates are indulged in irregularity and di&s;&s;ipation? It is requi&s;ite al&s;o for Schoolma&s;ters to be rather backward in granting leave for too fre|quent vi&s;its at home; for where they too much pre|vail, it has happened that <HI>the home</HI> and <HI>the &s;chool</HI> have each in their turns, been pleaded by the young truant as an apology for his ab&s;ence from both. And this is one of the mo&s;t fatal inroads from private
<PB N="244" REF="249">
mi&s;management on the beneficial influence of Pub|lick Education, where the wi&s;dom of the in&s;titu|tion is counteracted by the indi&s;cretion of indivi|duals.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e an author equally inclined to depreciate Dome&s;tick Tuition, as Locke has in his little tract &s;hewn him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to ridicule and vilify Publick Education, might not &s;uch a writer, abandoning the &s;traight path of candour and impartiality, and a&s;&s;um|ing the manners of a &s;atyrical pleader and declaimer, expre&s;s him&s;elf to the following purport?</P>
<Q>I cannot bear to &s;ee the free &s;pirit and generous nature of a youth, that &s;hould look abroad into the world of which he is him&s;elf a part, <Q REND="inline">"ca|bin'd, cribb'd, confin'd"</Q> in the narrow limits of a private family, a puny fondling dandled on the lap of his mother, or at be&s;t perhaps a tiny &s;port&s;man or &s;oaker in company of his father. If they have a country par&s;on in the hou&s;e, who teaches my young ma&s;ter to read, he teaches him to &s;moke at the &s;ame time, and envelopes in the &s;ame cloud his per&s;on and his under&s;tanding<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> The fir&s;t Latin that he conveys to him is the old axiom of <HI>in vino veritas,</HI> and his Greek (if he
<PB N="245" REF="250">
has any) is all <HI>Anacreontick.</HI> It is odds indeed whether his learning extends &s;o far. He is per|haps a mere <HI>Lingo,</HI> or at be&s;t a <HI>Square</HI> or a <HI>Thwackum</HI> in Mr. Allworthy's &s;plendid man&s;ion. Over the &s;ervants of the family the heir apparent is a little tyrant, and from his &s;ubjects he learns, as &s;oon as he can &s;peak, every &s;pecies of provincial bar|bari&s;m; and as &s;oon as he can think, or act, every kind of vice and meanne&s;s. <HI>Virtue, wi&s;|dom, breeding,</HI> and <HI>learning,</HI> are &s;eldom to be found under a private roof; but mu&s;t be &s;ought, like the Deity, in a &s;olemn temple con&s;ecrated to &s;uch &s;acred wor&s;hip!</Q>
<P>Waving ridicule and irony, and adhering as the &s;ubject requires, to &s;trict truth, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that Publick Education as well as Dome&s;tick Tui|tion, has its faults: but many of the corruptions of &s;chools are brought by the &s;cholars from home. At home are the fooli&s;h, the idle, and vicious &s;er|vants, &s;o much dreaded by Locke. At home indul|gence takes the place of di&s;cipline, and from home they often bring &s;ums of money far beyond their little occa&s;ions, by which artificial wants are created and di&s;orders introduced. This la&s;t evil, wholly owing to the indi&s;cretion of friends and parents, has
<PB N="246" REF="251">
been particularly noxious to Publick Schools. Ma&s;ters can only controul and check its influence. Friends and parents alone can prevent and extirpate it.</P>
<P>Publick Schools ought to cultivate the <HI>mathema|ticks,</HI> as well as the <HI>cla&s;&s;icks.</HI> Both might be taught &s;ufficiently, for the initiation of pupils, during their &s;tay at a Publick School; from whence they ought to be &s;ent to the Univer&s;ities, equally prepared to pur&s;ue their philo&s;ophical as their cla&s;&s;ical &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Publick Schools al&s;o generally detain their pupils too long. Youths &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from &s;chools at the age of &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen at the late&s;t. They are afterwards commencing young men, and will not patiently &s;ubmit to the corrections of children. When the boys at We&s;tmin&s;ter rebelled becau&s;e a &s;enior &s;cholar between eighteen and nineteen years of age would not &s;ubmit to the di&s;cipline of the rod, Dr. Barker, then a prebend, contended that the &s;cholar was in the right. It was wrong he &s;aid, to attempt to &s;courge a youth at that age. It was al|mo&s;t <HI>&s;odomy.</HI> Pity that Dr. Barker was not a Ge|neral!</P>
<P>In general it is unadvi&s;able for parents to &s;end their &s;ons to a Great Publick School, &s;ooner than at
<PB N="247" REF="252">
the period of nine or ten years of age; not that I would wi&s;h the preceding period to be lo&s;t and bu|ried in ignorance and idlene&s;s. Let their children in the mean while be &s;ent to &s;ome preparatory aca|demy, where they may be taught to write, to read, to &s;peak French, to dance, to draw, and the rudi|ments of Latin according to the grammar of the &s;chool for which they are afterwards intended. A ma&s;ter who cannot, by him&s;elf and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, &s;upply his little &s;tudents with the&s;e helps, is unfit to govern &s;uch an academy.</P>
<P>One great rea&s;on for preference of Publick to Private Education is this. Schoolboys, being at in|tervals called home, partake occa&s;ionally of the en|joyments and &s;ociety of a family. Private pupils, con&s;tantly confined within one narrow circle, ac|quire none of the freedom and &s;pirit of a Publick Education.</P>
<P><HI>Travel,</HI> where it can be afforded, cannot be ac|companied with the benefit that ought to attend it from the fir&s;t &s;tage of life, one of the periods to which Locke de&s;tines it: but being certainly im|proper at the u&s;ual time and in the u&s;ual mode, may be re&s;erved to Locke's la&s;t Stage, and therefore
<PB N="248" REF="253">
properly &s;ucceeding to a removal from the Univer|&s;ities; when the young traveller, if not fit and able to go alone, had better not go at all.</P>
<P>Milton has given <HI>A tractate on Education,</HI> contain|ing a plan of a &s;chool and univer&s;ity in one, intended to annihilate all other &s;chools and univer&s;ities, by in&s;tituting as many of &s;uch academies as might be nece&s;&s;ary in different parts of the kingdom. Yet in this plan, romantick as he almo&s;t him&s;elf &s;eems to think it, he has proceeded on principles very dif|ferent from tho&s;e of Locke, and &s;hewn him&s;elf the friend and advocate of Publick Education. He rather follows the principles of Plato and Xenophon, than adopts the &s;y&s;tem of Locke.</P>
<P>His propo&s;ed number of pupils is an hundred and fifty, more or le&s;s. He directs the teaching of lan|guages, <HI>not by rote,</HI> but by <HI>grammar,</HI> and tho&s;e not only modern but ancient, and of the ancient not only Latin, but Greek and Hebrew, with the Chaldean and Syrian dialects. So far from objecting to <HI>repetitions,</HI> that he enjoins Grammar le&s;&s;ons <HI>to be got by heart,</HI> and poems, and orations not merely to be read, but <Q REND="inline">"<HI>put to memory</HI> and &s;olemnly an|nounced with right accent and grace."</Q> And though, like Locke; he regrets the time thrown
<PB N="249" REF="254">
away in learning one or two languages, yet him&s;elf appropriates no le&s;s time than nine years, from twelve to twenty one, to education. He al&s;o fixes the age of twenty three or twenty four as the proper time for travel, if travel be nece&s;&s;ary. So that on the whole, though I have been hardy enough to enter the li&s;ts with &s;uch a giant antagoni&s;t as Locke, I have Milton to &s;upport me.</P>
<P>It appears indeed, on the face of Locke's tract, that the pre&s;ent plan of education is highly prefer|able to the &s;y&s;tem that prevailed at the time of his writing. The medical management of children is &s;o much improved, that many things which he re|commends, as contrary to the practice of tho&s;e times, are now in general u&s;e: and as to the cul|tivation of their minds, were he now living, he would no longer lament the want of a &s;ixpenny Hi&s;tory of the Bible, or an Ae&s;op with pictures to every fable. The book&s;ellers have provided the little &s;tudents a Lilliputian library, and every toy&s;hop and Stationer will &s;upply them with polygons for the vowels, or the whole alphabet in cards or ivory, unle&s;s they &s;hould rather chu&s;e to &s;wallow it in gin|gerbread. Geography is learnt by the dice, like the Game of the Goo&s;e; maps are di&s;&s;ected into
<PB N="250" REF="255">
kingdoms, and provinces; and perhaps to Locke him&s;elf we owe many of tho&s;e valuable atchieve|ments.</P>
<P>Univer&s;ities, tho&s;e dry nur&s;es that &s;ucceed to the fir&s;t feminaries of education, are al&s;o much improved in their principles and practice &s;ince the aeras of Milton and Locke: and if the &s;tudents do not at their departure make due progre&s;s in their &s;everal pur&s;uits and profe&s;&s;ions, the failure mu&s;t be imputed to them&s;elves, who have &s;o ill applied the time they have pa&s;&s;ed there. At one univer&s;ity &s;ince the time of Milton, a great and tran&s;cendent genius has ad|vanced the career of &s;cience as Milton him&s;elf car|ried the flights of poetry, <HI>beyond the vi&s;ible diurnal &s;phere.</HI> At the other an acute and able juri&s;prudent, who&s;e early lo&s;s we &s;till lament, in&s;tituted a cour&s;e of lectures of e&s;tabli&s;hed authority to the profe&s;&s;ional reader, as well as affording, in the mo&s;t elegant terms, a code of law nece&s;&s;ary for the in&s;truction and peru&s;al of every private gentleman. The &s;tudents too are now le&s;s bewildered in the labyrinths of lo|gick and metaphy&s;icks. To their original re&s;i&s;tance to the principles of Locke perhaps we owe much of his prejudice to Publick Education. His prejudices, were he now a living witne&s;s of the cordial reception
<PB N="251" REF="256">
of his doctrines, would perhaps vani&s;h: though he might &s;till in&s;i&s;t, and not without ju&s;tice, accord|ing to the Tirocinium<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Tirocinium</HI> forms part of a collection of poems by W. Cowper, E&s;q. one of which poems is <HI>The Ta&s;k,</HI> a mo&s;t admirable work in blank ver&s;e, which gives a mo&s;t promi&s;ing earne&s;t of the author's intended Tran&s;lation of Homer in that mea&s;ure.</NOTE> of my worthy and ingenious friend Mr. Cowper, that <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> &s;hould &s;tand as porter at the gate of every college.</P>
<P>The &s;tudy of Geography, Chronology, Hi&s;tory, the Elements of Natural Philo&s;ophy and Geometry, may ea&s;ily be reconciled to the plan of the early part of Publick Education, and &s;hould be incorporated with it. As to dancing, fencing, and accounts, the&s;e are generally taught by &s;eparate ma&s;ters, according to the direction of the parents without need of parti|cular injunction or &s;erious di&s;&s;ertation. Painting and mu&s;ick are indeed not in &s;o general reque&s;t, and the truth is that gentlemen practitioners either mi&s;|apply much of their time, or fall infinitely below the mo&s;t common arti&s;ts of either profe&s;&s;ion. If a <HI>trade</HI> is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to a &s;tudent and a gen|tleman, that of a <HI>gardener</HI> &s;eems to be the mo&s;t
<PB N="252" REF="257">
healthy and agreeable, to which in bad weather may be added the occupation of a joiner or car|penter, as on that account both Locke and Rou&s;|&s;eau recommend it. And a &s;choolboy is perhaps more qualified even for &s;uch an apprentice&s;hip, as well as for the more honourable and hazardous avo|cations of the army or navy, than a young gentle|man bred in a private family.</P>
<P>Locke concludes his tract on education with the&s;e words.</P>
<Q>Though I am now come to a conclu&s;ion of what obvious remarks have &s;ugge&s;ted to me con|cerning Education, <HI>I would not have it thought that I look on it as a ju&s;t treati&s;e on this &s;ubject.</HI> There are a thou&s;and other things that may need con&s;ideration, e&s;pecially if one &s;hould take in the various tempers, different inclinations, and par|ticular defaults that are to be found in children, and pre&s;cribe proper remedies. The variety is &s;o great, that it would require a volume; nor would that reach it. Each man's mind has &s;ome peculiarity, as well as his face, that di&s;tingui&s;hes him from all others, and there are po&s;&s;ibly &s;carce two children who can be conducted by exactly the &s;ame method. Be&s;ides that I think a prince, a nobleman, and an ordinary gentleman's &s;on,
<PB N="253" REF="258">
&s;hould have different ways of breeding. But having had here only &s;ome general views in re|ference to the main end, and aims in education, and tho&s;e de&s;igned for a gentleman's &s;on who being then very little, I con&s;idered only as white paper or wax, to be moulded and fa&s;hioned as one plea&s;es, I have touched little more than tho&s;e heads which I judged nece&s;&s;ary for the breeding of a young gentleman of his condition in ge|neral; and have now publi&s;hed the&s;e my occa|&s;ional thoughts with this hope; that though this be far from being a compleat treati&s;e on this &s;ubject, or &s;uch as that every one may find what will ju&s;t fit his child in it, yet it may give &s;ome &s;mall light to tho&s;e who&s;e concern for their dear little ones makes them &s;o irregularly bold, that they dare venture to con&s;ult their own rea&s;on in the education of their children, rather than wholly to rely upon Old Cu&s;tom.</Q>
<P>If Locke could not call his work <HI>a compleat trea|ti&s;e on Education,</HI> much le&s;s can I pre&s;ume to &s;ubmit the&s;e loo&s;e thoughts to the reader in that light; e&s;pe|cially as they are not offered under that idea, but mere|ly to vindicate Publick E&s;tabli&s;hments from cen&s;ures that appeared, coming from whom&s;oever, unju&s;t and illiberal. If the awful and revered name of Locke
<PB N="254" REF="259">
gave a &s;anction to prejudices, it was but acting with the &s;pirit, though without the talents, of Locke, to combat them. Almo&s;t all the &s;y&s;tems of Private Education appear a romantick theory, not reducible to practice. Locke him&s;elf &s;ays <Q REND="inline">"that a prince, a nobleman, and an ordinary gentleman's &s;on &s;hould have a different way of breeding."</Q> Yet the attention enjoined to be given to his pupil, not to dwell on the character of his <HI>Tutor,</HI> are &s;carce to be expected even by a prince, though he con|fe&s;&s;es that his views and main end were to &s;ugge&s;t hints on tho&s;e heads, nece&s;&s;ary for the education of <HI>a gentleman's &s;on.</HI> A Telemachus may obtain a Minerva for a Mentor; an Engli&s;h Prince may command a Markham or a Hurd: but the &s;on of a gentleman, the &s;on of a nobleman I will venture to &s;ay will at lea&s;t derive as much benefit from a Publick Education as from Private Tuition. Neither <HI>themes</HI> nor <HI>ver&s;es,</HI> &s;o dreaded by Locke, impede their progre&s;s to the fir&s;t offices, and mo&s;t important duties. The&s;e are facts founded on experience, and the many illu&s;trious characters that have begun their career on a royal foundation will fully ju&s;tify my a&s;&s;ertion.</P>

<P>CASTING my eye on the London Gazette a few days ago, it gave me infinite plea&s;ure to &s;ee particular Orders i&s;&s;ued from the War-Office, <Q REND="inline">"That all His Maje&s;ty's Regiments of Hor&s;e and Dragoons, except the Light Hor&s;e, &s;hall be mounted only on &s;uch hor&s;es, as have their <HI>full tails, without the lea&s;t part taken from them.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Never &s;urely did the tyrant man exerci&s;e a more wanton piece of cruelty over his &s;ubjects of the brute creation, than in clipping the Tails of the hor&s;es, and robbing them of their fair and natural proportion. Ca&s;tration it&s;elf, cruel as it is, carries to &s;port&s;men and epicures &s;ome apology along with
<PB N="256" REF="261">
it. Fowls become a plumper and more delicious mor&s;el, after being made capons; and hor&s;es, con|verted into geldings, are thereby rendered more tract|able. But we of the <HI>Yahoo</HI> &s;pecies have nothing to plead in our excu&s;e to the generous <HI>Houhnymn</HI> for thus barbarou&s;ly depriving him of a part of his frame, which nature has wi&s;ely given him for &s;everal purpo&s;es both of u&s;e and ornament.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom, it is true, has long authori&s;ed this &s;avage practice; yet it has not been able to reconcile us to it entirely. In &s;culpture, painting, and tape&s;try, hor&s;es &s;till wear <HI>their full tails, without the lea&s;t part taken from them.</HI> Do but contemplate the figure of a king on hor&s;eback on a pede&s;tal, or of a general in a battle piece, either on canvas or in the arras; the mane and tail of the hor&s;e is as full and flowing as the periwig of the rider. The tail of Bucephalus him&s;elf has not a bolder &s;weep than that of the noble bea&s;ts who bear Lewis the Fourteenth, or the duke of Marlborough. What &s;hould we &s;ay to Stubbs, were he to put a &s;et of docked geldings to the chariot of Phaeton? Or how &s;hould we con&s;ider the very &s;ame mutilations, were we to make the experiments on other quadrupeds? Figure to your&s;elf the view of a pa&s;ture covered with bulls, cows, &s;heep, and oxen,
<PB N="257" REF="262">
grazing on a common, or a mountain, as bare|breeched as a highlander!</P>
<P>This practice al&s;o, to the &s;hame of our age and nation be it &s;poken, is both local and recent. In the antient times of chivalry what figure would a knight have made on &s;uch a maimed &s;teed! and what dam&s;el would have deigned to mount a bob|tailed palfry? The beginning even of the pre&s;ent century &s;aw our hor&s;es &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their <HI>full tails.</HI> It was then the <HI>Bon Ton.</HI><Q REND="inline">"Fopping|ton's <HI>long tails</HI> were known on every road in chri&s;tendom."</Q> At pre&s;ent except Lord Fal|mouth's &s;et of duns, and the royal <HI>octave</HI> of cream-coloured hor&s;es, we have, alas, no <HI>long tails</HI> in the kingdom. But the year one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and &s;ixty four is, I hope, the happy aera from whence we may date their re&s;toration. All the Engli&s;h Cavalry, except the Light Hor&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"&s;hall be mounted only on &s;uch hor&s;es, as have their full tails <HI>without the lea&s;t part taken from them.</HI>"</Q> It was indeed, high time for &s;uch a reformation. Many centuries elap&s;ed before our con&s;titution pro|vided a law again&s;t attempts to deface and maim the human body: and it was now become equally ne|ce&s;&s;ary to i&s;&s;ue the above Orders from the War-Office,
<PB N="258" REF="263">
which it is hoped, will operate as a kind of <HI>Coven|try Act,</HI> again&s;t <HI>hogging, docking,</HI> and <HI>nicking,</HI> the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>As a true patriot, I am equally anxious to wipe off a national reflection, as to alter the fa&s;hion. This cruel practice is one of the &s;tains on our man|ners, which has given our enemies occa&s;ion to &s;tyle us <HI>The Savages of Europe.</HI> In France neither hor&s;e, nor man, nor woman, can have too much hair, but all carry it unviolated on their heads and their tails, <Q REND="inline">"without the lea&s;t part taken from them."</Q> In England full-bottoms and full tails vani&s;hed at the &s;ame period. Crop-eared coxcombs and docked hor&s;es, <HI>hogged</HI> manes and <HI>hogged</HI> toupees, came in together. A wonderful analogy between the treat|ment of our fellow countrymen's heads, and their hor&s;es tails! From this analogy it is that our neigh|bours have imbibed the a&s;&s;ociated idea of the &s;avage|ne&s;s of our manners; and an Engli&s;hman at Paris is &s;ure to be reproached with the barbarity of our beheading kings, and docking hor&s;es.</P>
