<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DID this Addre&s;s aim no farther than at the com|mon End of Dedicators, I &s;hould have been proud enough to have declined the Trouble, and <HI>You</HI> too wi&s;e to have approved this public Manner of offering it.</P>
<P>TO prai&s;e You, were <HI>imper|tinent;</HI> and to tell others of my Obligations to You, would have the Appearance rather of <HI>Vani|ty</HI> than <HI>Gratitude.</HI></P>

THE Truth is; I make free with Your Name on this Oc|ca&s;ion, not &s;o much to <HI>protect</HI> my <HI>Book,</HI> as to <HI>complete</HI> my <HI>Argument.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE ventured to criticize the Works of a very celebrated Writer, who took it into his Head to oppo&s;e the &s;olid Wi&s;|dom of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> by the Vi&s;i|ons of <HI>fal&s;e Philo&s;ophy.</HI> As His, at be&s;t, is but the Cau&s;e of <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Eloquence,</HI> all the Sup|port he could give it was only to tell us <HI>how</HI> PLATO <HI>wrote:</HI> Mine being that of <HI>Truth,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> I have the Advan|tage of <HI>realizing</HI> all I &s;ay, in bidding the World take Notice <HI>how</HI> YOU <HI>live.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="6">
IN a Word; I was willing to bring the Que&s;tion to a &s;hort I&s;&s;ue; and &s;hew, by a <HI>known</HI> EXAMPLE, to what an Elevati|on true <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> can exalt human Nature. Till therefore philo&s;ophic <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> can produce a parallel Effect, <HI>Religion</HI> mu&s;t bear the <HI>Palm;</HI> and CHRISTIANITY, like her <HI>Pa|rent</HI> WISDOM, <HI>will be ju&s;tified of her Children.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ESSAYS ON THE Characteri&s;tics, etc.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ESSAY I. On Ridicule, con&s;idered as a Te&s;t of Truth.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>IT hath been the Fate of Lord SHAFTES|BURY's <HI>Characteri&s;tics,</HI> beyond that of mo&s;t other Books, to be idolized by one Party, and dete&s;ted by another. While the fir&s;t regard it as a Work of <HI>perfect Ex|cellence,</HI> as containing every Thing that can render Mankind wi&s;e and happy; the lat|ter are di&s;po&s;ed to rank it among the mo&s;t pernicious of Writings, and brand it as one
<PB N="2" REF="12">
continued Heap of <HI>Fu&s;tian, Scurrility,</HI> and <HI>Fal&s;ehood.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Circum&s;tance hath always appeared to me a Demon&s;tration, that Pa&s;&s;ion and Prejudice have had a greater Share than Rea&s;on, in deciding upon the Merits of this Work; which many read with Di&s;plea&s;ure, more with Admiration, but few with im|partial Judgment. 'Tis probable, the Truth lies between the two Extremes of the&s;e di&s;cordant Opinions: and that the noble Writer hath mingled Beauties and Blots, Faults and Excellencies, with a liberal and un&s;paring Hand.</P>
<P>THESE, &s;o far as they relate to <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Morals,</HI> it is my pre&s;ent Intention to point out, without Regard to the bigoted Cen&s;ures of his Friends or Enemies: While I fore&s;ee, that &s;ome will <HI>frown</HI> upon me for allowing him any Thing, and others treat me with a <HI>contemptuous Smile</HI> for pre|&s;uming to differ with him at all.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Thing that occurs to an unpre|judiced Mind, in the Peru&s;al of the <HI>Cha|racteri&s;tics,</HI> is that generous Spirit of <HI>Free|dom</HI> which &s;hines throughout the whole. The noble Author every where a&s;&s;erts that natural Privilege of Man, which hath been
<PB N="3" REF="13">
&s;o often denied him, of &s;eeing with his own Eyes, and judging by his own Rea&s;on. It may po&s;&s;ibly appear &s;trange to &s;ome, why he &s;hould &s;o extremely labour a Point &s;o plain. But in Ju&s;tice to his Lord&s;hip the&s;e Gentlemen mu&s;t remember, or be informed, that in former Times, &s;ome well-de&s;igning Men among our&s;elves, from a groundle&s;s Dread of an unlimited Freedom of the Pre&s;s, attempted to make a mo&s;t unnatural and cruel Separation between <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Liberty.</HI> Having &s;haken off the Corrup|tions of <HI>Popery,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;hed what they thought a pure and perfect Sy&s;tem, they un|happily &s;topped &s;hort in their full Carrier of Glory; prepo&s;terou&s;ly attempting to deprive others of that common Privilege which they had &s;o nobly exerci&s;ed them&s;elves. This mi&s;taken Spirit &s;eemed entirely &s;ubdued by the excellent LOCKE, and others, about the Time of the Revolution: But at the Period when our noble Author wrote, it not only revived, but was heightened by a terrible Acce&s;&s;ion of Bitterne&s;s and Rancour. Hence tho&s;e frequent Sallies of Invective, which he throws out again&s;t this intolerant Principle, which he ju&s;tly &s;tigmatizeth as equally im|politic, irrational, and unchri&s;tian.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="14">
'TIS the Glory of our Days, that this ac|cur&s;ed Spirit of Per&s;ecution is at lea&s;t dying away. What Pity that we cannot add, it is wholly extingui&s;hed! It is true, we mo&s;t of us profe&s;s our&s;elves Friends to a Free|dom of Inquiry, <HI>in the Main.</HI> But why, <HI>in the Main?</HI> Why that needle&s;s Circum&s;tance of He&s;itation? Would we embrace Error? Or do we think that Truth can &s;uffer by the mo&s;t rigid Scrutiny? On the contrary, not only the Perfection, but the very Being of Knowledge depends on the Exerci&s;e of Freedom. For whatever &s;ome may fear from an open and unlimited Enquiry, it &s;eems evidently the only Means vouch|&s;afed us for the Attainment of Truth. The <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> of it may be <HI>hurtful,</HI> but the <HI>Want</HI> of it is <HI>fatal.</HI> Such, indeed, are the clear and undoubted Principles of our Religion: Nei|ther &s;ure can the&s;e Declarations &s;urprize us. For if human and political E&s;tabli&s;hments had been &s;acred or unviolable, where had been our <HI>Prote&s;tanti&s;m;</HI> nay, where our <HI>Chri&s;tianity?</HI> Dare we then to de&s;ert or di&s;|countenance a Principle, on which not only the Purity, but the very Exi&s;tence of our Religion depends? Nor is this Principle le&s;s con&s;onant with the &s;tricte&s;t Rea&s;on. It
<PB N="5" REF="15">
is Fal&s;ehood only that loves and retires into Darkne&s;s. Truth delights in the Day; and demands no more than a ju&s;t Light, to ap|pear in perfect Beauty. A rigid Exami|nation is its only Te&s;t: For Experience hath taught us, that even <HI>Ob&s;tinacy</HI> and <HI>Error</HI> can endure the <HI>Fires</HI> of Per&s;ecution: But it is genuine Truth, and that alone, which comes out pure and <HI>unchanged</HI> from the <HI>&s;everer Tortures</HI> of Debate.</P>
<P>IT will ever be our true&s;t Prai&s;e there|fore, to join the noble Apologi&s;t in his En|comiums on <HI>Freedom;</HI> the only permanent Ba&s;is on which <HI>Religion</HI> or <HI>Virtue</HI> can be e&s;tabli&s;hed. Nor can we le&s;s approve his frequent Recommendations of <HI>Politene&s;s, Chearfulne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Good-humour,</HI> in the Pro|&s;ecution of our mo&s;t important Enquiries. The moro&s;e, contemptuous, and &s;urly Species of Compo&s;ition is generally an Appendage to Bigotry, as appears in In&s;tances innu|merable, both among the mi&s;taken Friends and Enemies of Religion. On the con|trary, the amiable Qualities of Chearful|ne&s;s and Good-humour, ca&s;t a Kind of Sun|&s;hine over a Compo&s;ition, and naturally en|gage us in Favour of the Writer. They re&s;emble that gentle Smile that often lights
<PB N="6" REF="16">
up the human Countenance, the never-failing Indication of a humane Temper. How naturally then mu&s;t we be di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten; how open our Minds to receive Con|viction, when we perceive our Opponent's Intention is benevolent: When we perceive that his Aim is not <HI>Victory,</HI> but <HI>Informa|tion:</HI> that he means not to <HI>in&s;ult,</HI> but to <HI>in&s;truct</HI> us.</P>
<P>SO far, out of an unfeigned Regard to Truth, it &s;hould be my Boa&s;t to take Party with the noble Writer: On the &s;ame Prin|ciple it will now be nece&s;&s;ary to depart from him. For, not content with e&s;tabli&s;hing the free Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on, and the Way of Chearfulne&s;s, in treating the Subjects of Religion and Morals; he revolts from the Principle on which the rational Advocates for Religion were willing to have joined him, and appeals to a new Te&s;t, <HI>the Te&s;t of Ridicule.</HI> This, in his two fir&s;t Treati&s;es, he attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h as a &s;urer Method of Conviction: And <HI>that</HI> Ridicule, which had hitherto been employed in <HI>di&s;gracing known Fal&s;ehood,</HI> he informs us, may be &s;uc|ce&s;sfully applied to the <HI>Inve&s;tigation</HI> of <HI>un|known Truth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="17">
HE hath gained a numerous Train of Followers in this new Opinion: It may be therefore nece&s;&s;ary to examine its Foun|dations.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS great Pity the noble Author hath not conde&s;cended to a little more <HI>Preci&s;ion</HI> in treating the Que&s;tion now before us. He indulges the Gaiety of Spirit, the Freedom of <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Humour</HI> &s;o far, that a Reader, who &s;eeks Information rather than Amu&s;e|ment, is often at a Lo&s;s to know where his Argument, or even his Opinion, lies. This, no doubt, was in Part owing to a generous Abhorrence of <HI>Pedantry,</HI> which he takes all Occa&s;ions of expo&s;ing to Contempt. Yet a better Rea&s;on may po&s;&s;ibly be alledged: For in recommending and enforcing the <HI>U&s;e of Ridicule,</HI> what could be more natural and proper than the <HI>Power of Ridicule</HI> it&s;elf? To draw a &s;triking Picture of demure Folly and &s;olemn Impo&s;ture, was a Ma&s;terpiece of Prudence: But to have argued <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly,</HI> would have de&s;troyed his Argument: It would have been a tacit Confe&s;&s;ion, that there is a deeper Foundation, on which
<PB N="8" REF="18">
Ridicule it&s;elf mu&s;t re&s;t, he mu&s;t there|fore have overturned, even while he intend|ed to e&s;tabli&s;h this new Pillar, and <HI>Ground of Truth.</HI></P>
<P>HERE then we di&s;cover why the noble Author is &s;o witty in Defence of Wit, and chu&s;es to maintain the Cau&s;e of Raillery by Raillery it&s;elf. He &s;miles at his Adver&s;ary, who had attempted to find Coherence in his fir&s;t Letter<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vol. iii. p. 18, 20.</BIBL></NOTE>. He glories in being an Adventurer in the Way of <HI>Mi&s;cellany;</HI> where <Q REND="inline">"Cuttings and Shreds of Learning, with various Fragments and Points of Wit, are drawn together and tacked in any fanta&s;tic Form. Where the Wild and Whim&s;ical, under the Name of the Odd and Pretty, &s;ucceed in the Room of the Graceful and Beautiful: Where Ju&s;t|ne&s;s and Accuracy of Thought are &s;et a&s;ide, as too con&s;training, and of too painful an A&s;pect, to be endured in the agreeable and more ea&s;y Commerce of Gallantry and modern Wit<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid. p. 5, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Hence with Rea&s;on he proceeds to his Conclu&s;ion, that <Q REND="inline">"Grounds and Foundations are of no Moment, in a Kind of Work, which, ac|cording
<PB N="9" REF="19">
to modern E&s;tabli&s;hment, has pro|perly neither <HI>Top</HI> nor <HI>Bottom, Beginning</HI> nor <HI>End.</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vol. iii. p. 8.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in the Con|duct of the literary Warfare, they who de|pend on the Regularity and Force of <HI>Argu|ments,</HI> have but a &s;orry Chance again&s;t the&s;e nimble Adventurers in the <HI>Sallies</HI> of Wit and Ridicule; the&s;e <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> in Di&s;|putation, who confide more in their Agi|lity, than Strength or Di&s;cipline; and by &s;udden <HI>Evolutions</HI> and timely <HI>Skulking,</HI> can do great Mi&s;chiefs, without receiving any. Ill qualified, indeed, is the <HI>&s;aturnine</HI> Com|plexion of the dry <HI>Rea&s;oner,</HI> to cope with this <HI>mercurial</HI> Spirit of modern <HI>Wit:</HI> The Formali&s;t is under a double Difficulty; not only to <HI>conquer</HI> his Enemy, but to <HI>find</HI> him. Though it mu&s;t be owned, the Search is a harder Ta&s;k than the <HI>Victory;</HI> and more mortifying, as it ends in &s;hewing us that this redoubted Figure of <HI>Ridicule,</HI> armed at all Points like <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> is no other than an airy Phantom, tricked up by the Godde&s;s of Folly, to confound formal Wi&s;dom; as that other in the Poet, to mi&s;lead his Hero:
<Q><PB N="10" REF="20">
<L>Tum dea nube cava <HI>tenuem &s;ine viribus umbram</HI></L>
<L>In faciem Aeneae (vi&s;u mirabile mon&s;trum)</L>
<L><HI>Dardaniis ornat telis:</HI> clypeumque, juba&s;que</L>
<L><HI>Divini</HI> a&s;&s;imilat <HI>capitis;</HI> dat <HI>inania verba,</HI></L>
<L>Dat <HI>&s;ine mente &s;onum,</HI> gre&s;&s;u&s;que effingit euntis.</L>
<L>Illum autem ab&s;entem Aeneas in praelia po&s;cit.</L>
<L>Tunc levis haud ultra <HI>latebras</HI> jam <HI>quaerit</HI> imago,</L>
<L>Sed &s;ublime volans, <HI>nubi</HI> &s;e <HI>immi&s;cuit</HI> atrae<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Virg. Aen. x. &vers; 636, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>SINCE, therefore, the noble Writer de|clines treating this Subject in the Way of clo&s;e Argument; we mu&s;t take our Chance with him upon the Terms he hath been plea&s;ed to pre&s;cribe. We mu&s;t be content to go a <HI>Gleaning</HI> for his Opinions, and <HI>pick them up</HI> as they lie thinly &s;cattered through a wide Extent of Pages.</P>
<P>BUT, however, his Lord&s;hip's high Qua|lity may exempt him from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Forms of Argument, it were the Height of Imprudence in Writers of inferior Rank, to attempt an Imitation of his peculiar Man|ner. His delicate Raillery, therefore, will be&s;t be repayed by &s;ober Rea&s;oning. This, &s;ure, his mo&s;t zealous Admirers cannot take ami&s;s: It is the noble Author's allowed Maxim, that <Q REND="inline">"a Je&s;t which will not bear a &s;erious Examination is certainly fal&s;e Wit<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vol. i. p. 74.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Neither was he a Stranger to
<PB N="11" REF="21">
the methodical Species of Compo&s;ition: As appears from that fine Chain of moral Rea|&s;oning which connects his Enquiry concern|ing Virtue: Where he proceeds through the Work with a Pace equally regular and ma|je&s;tic. Indeed &s;hould we form our Idea of him from the Attitudes in which his &s;orry Mimics pre&s;ent him to our View, we &s;hould &s;ee him labouring through a con|fu&s;ed Ma&s;s of Words and random Half-meanings, entangled in his own Argument, and throwing him&s;elf into every unnatural and awkward Po&s;ture, to make his Way, though in vain, into common Sen&s;e. But this is a very bad Picture of our noble Au|thor: Though it be all his affected Ad|mirers can exhibit of him in their own Productions. Deformities are ea&s;ily copied: True Features and graceful Attitudes are caught by the Hand of a <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> only. For in Reality, none ever knew the Value of Order and Proportion better than Lord SHAFTESBURY. He knew that Confu&s;ion can only tend to <HI>di&s;grace</HI> Truth, or <HI>di&s;gui&s;e</HI> Fal&s;ehood. Method, indeed, may dege|nerate into Stiffne&s;s, but to de&s;pi&s;e Order, is the &s;illie&s;t <HI>Affectation.</HI> E&s;pecially when the &s;lovenly and con&s;u&s;ed Form of the Com|po&s;ition
<PB N="12" REF="22">
(if it may be properly &s;aid to have any) pretends to the Character of <HI>Elegance,</HI> it becomes of all others the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t <HI>contemptible Pedantry.</HI></P>

<P>THE divine Author of our Being having given us &s;everal different Powers, <HI>Sen&s;e, Ima|gination, Memory,</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> as the Inlets, Pre&s;ervers, and Improvers of Knowledge; it may be proper here briefly to remark their re&s;pective Provinces.

<P>FROM this View of Things we may, in pa&s;&s;ing, further &s;ee the <HI>Nature, Limits,</HI> and <HI>comparative Excellence</HI> of the various Kinds of Poetry. The <HI>De&s;criptive</HI> holds entirely
<PB N="19" REF="29">
of the Imagination, and may be termed <HI>pure Poetry</HI> or Imitation: Yet, with regard to the <HI>&s;econdary</HI> End of In&s;truction, it &s;eems to merit only the lowe&s;t Place, becau&s;e it is then perfect when it &s;atisfies the Imagina|tion; and while it offends not Rea&s;on, or the Affections, nothing further with regard to the&s;e Faculties is expected from it. The <HI>Tragic, Comic, Satiric,</HI> and the <HI>Elegy,</HI> as they chiefly regard the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> and the Heart of Man, &s;o they draw much of their Force from the Sources of <HI>Eloquence.</HI> On the other hand, the <HI>Didactic,</HI> as it makes its chief Application to Rea&s;on, though it re|tains &s;o much of the Graces of Imagi|nation, as to merit the Name of Poetry, is principally of the <HI>logical</HI> Species. The <HI>Epic,</HI> by its great Extent, includes all the&s;e Kinds by turns, and is therefore the <HI>noble&s;t,</HI> both in its <HI>primary</HI> and <HI>&s;econdary</HI> Intention.

Their Opinion &s;eems to have

But whoever &s;hall thoroughly examine the Sentiments of the <HI>grand Ma&s;ter,</HI> will find he only meant to a&s;&s;ert, that the <HI>Mode of Imitation</HI> in <HI>Tragedy</HI> is more forci|ble, and therefore &s;uperior to that of the <HI>epic</HI> Kind; becau&s;e in the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> the Action is only <HI>told,</HI> in the former, it is <HI>vi&s;ibly repre|&s;ented.</HI> This is the Truth. But if we con|&s;ider, not the <HI>Mode</HI> of Imitation, but the <HI>Subjects</HI> imitated; if we con&s;ider the com|parative <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> of the Action which the&s;e two Kinds of Poetry can comprehend; and the moral Ends of <HI>In&s;truction,</HI> no le&s;s than the Variety and Beauty of <HI>De&s;cription,</HI> which con&s;titutes the very E&s;&s;ence of Poe|try; we &s;hall find the Epic greatly &s;uperior, on account of the Extent and Importance of tho&s;e <HI>Actions,</HI> and the Variety of <HI>Cha|racters</HI> which it is capable of involving. Thus for In&s;tance, &s;uch an Action as the Death of OEDIPUS or CATO may be more perfectly imitated (becau&s;e <HI>vi&s;ibly</HI> repre|&s;ented) in Tragedy, than in the Epos: But a much greater and more exten&s;ive Action, &s;uch as the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment of an Empire,</HI> with

all its &s;ubordinate Epi&s;odes, religious, poli|tical, and moral, cannot be comprehended or exhibited in <HI>Tragedy,</HI> while yet they may be perfectly de&s;cribed in the <HI>Epop&eacute;e.</HI></P>
<P>SO much concerning <HI>Poetry</HI> will be found to have Relation to our Subject.

<P>ELOQUENCE then is no other than a Species of Poetry applied to the particular End of Per&s;ua&s;ion. For Per&s;ua&s;ion can only be effected by rowzing the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Soul; and the&s;e, we have &s;een, are only to be moved by a Force impre&s;&s;ed on the Ima|gination, a&s;&s;uming the Appearance of Truth; which is the e&s;&s;ential Nature of poetical Compo&s;ition. Thus the Lord VERULAM: <Q REND="inline">"In all Per&s;ua&s;ions that are wrought by Eloquence, and other Impre&s;&s;ion of like Nature, which paint and di&s;gui&s;e the true Appearance of Things, the chief Recom|mendation unto <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> is from the <HI>Ima|gination</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>De Aug.

in Fact <Q REND="inline">"the oratorial Elocution was but an Imitation of the poetical: This ap|peared fir&s;t, and was approved: They who imitated it, took off the Mea&s;ures, but &s;till pre&s;erved all the other Parts of Poetry in their Writings: Such were CADMUS the Mile&s;ian, PHERECYDES, and HECATAEUS. Their Followers then took &s;omething more from what was left, and at length Elocution de&s;cended into the Pro&s;e which is now among us<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> <BIBL>Strabo, lib. i.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THUS as the Pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t have an <HI>ap|parent Object</HI> of Good or Evil offered by the Imagination in order to excite them; &s;o Eloquence mu&s;t offer <HI>apparent Evidence</HI> ere it can be received and acquie&s;ced in: For the Mind cannot embrace known Fal&s;e|hood. So that every Opinion which Elo|quence in&s;tills, though it be the pure Re&s;ult of certain fictitious Images impre&s;&s;ed on the Fancy, is always regarded as the Re&s;ult of rational Conviction, and received by the Mind as Truth.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="33">

<P>HENCE too we may &s;ee where the true Medium lies between the too frequent <HI>U&s;e,</HI> and delicate <HI>Avoidance</HI> of poetical Images, in Eloquence.

For the <HI>Epic,</HI> tending chiefly to Admiration and In|&s;truction, allows a full Di&s;play of Art: But
<PB N="24" REF="34">
the <HI>Tragic,</HI> being of the per&s;ua&s;ive Kind, mu&s;t only regard and touch upon poetical Images in this &s;ingle View, <HI>as they tend to rowze the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Soul.</HI> MACRO|BIUS<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Saturnal. 1. iv. pa&s;&s;im.</BIBL></NOTE> hath collected many elegant Exam|ples of this <HI>poctic Elocution</HI> from the <HI>Eneid:</HI> He hath ranged them in Cla&s;&s;es, and pointed out the Fountains whence the great Poet drew his <HI>Pathos:</HI> And &s;ure, it may with Truth be affirmed, that <Q REND="inline">"the Ma&s;ter|&s;trokes of that divine Work are rather of the <HI>Tragic,</HI> than the <HI>Epic</HI> Species."</Q></P>

<P>THE true Rea&s;on therefore, why Elo|quence gained &s;uch mighty Power in the&s;e famed Republics was, <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e the Ora|tors addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the <HI>People</HI> as their <HI>Judges.</HI>"</Q> Here the Art triumphed: for it had not <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> to in&s;truct, but <HI>Imagi|nation</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> to controul.

For where the Councils of a Nation depend on the united Rea&s;on of elected Repre&s;entatives, or wi&s;e and cunning State&s;men, though the laboured E&s;&s;ays of Eloquence may often <HI>amu&s;e,</HI> they will &s;eldom <HI>determine.</HI> This &s;eems to be the Ca&s;e of our own Age and Country: And were it nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge on this Subject, it might be made appear, that they who complain of the Decay of public Elo|quence among us, a&s;&s;ign a Cau&s;e which hath

<P>THUS Eloquence gains its End of Per|&s;ua&s;ion by offering <HI>apparent</HI> Truth to the Imagination; as Argument gains its proper End of Conviction by offering <HI>real</HI> Truth to the Under&s;tanding. Mr. HOBBES &s;eems to have been well aware of this Di&s;tinction. <Q REND="inline">"This, &s;ays he, <HI>viz.</HI> laying Evidence be|fore the Mind, is called <HI>teaching;</HI> the Hearer is therefore &s;aid to <HI>learn:</HI> But if there be not &s;uch Evidence, then &s;uch teaching is called <HI>Per&s;ua&s;ion,</HI> and beget|teth no more in the Hearer, than what is in the Speaker's <HI>bare Opinion</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Hobbes on Hum.

<P>HERE then we perceive, that the Con&s;e|quences of Eloquence, with regard to &s;pe|culative <HI>In&s;truction</HI> and <HI>Inquiry,</HI> are of a very different Nature from tho&s;e which relate to <HI>Morals</HI> and <HI>Action.</HI> To In&s;truction or In|quiry, every Species of Eloquence mu&s;t for ever be an Enemy: For though it may lead the Mind to acquie&s;ce in a ju&s;t Opinion, yet
<PB N="30" REF="40">
it leads it to acquie&s;ce upon a fal&s;e Foun|dation: It puts the Hearer or Reader in the Speaker's or Writer's Power: And though he be &s;o hone&s;t as to lead him in the Path of Truth, yet &s;till he leads him <HI>blind-fold.</HI> In this Sen&s;e, and under this Limitation, Mr. LOCKE's Remark is true: <Q REND="inline">"We mu&s;t allow that all the Art of Rhetoric, be&s;ides Order and Clearne&s;s, all the artificial and figurative Application of Words Elo|quence hath invented, are for nothing el&s;e but to <HI>in&s;inuate wrong</HI> Ideas, <HI>move the Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and <HI>thereby mi&s;lead</HI> the Judgment, and &s;o indeed are perfect Cheats<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Locke on Hum.

<P>But if we regard what is of more Im|portance to Man, than mere &s;peculative Truth, I mean the <HI>practical Ends</HI> of hu|man Life and moral Action; then Elo|quence a&s;&s;umes a higher Nature: Nor is there, in this practical Sen&s;e, any ne|ce&s;&s;ary Connexion between <HI>moving</HI> the Pa&s;&s;ions, and <HI>mi&s;leading</HI> the Judgment. For though the Ends of Truth and Per&s;ua&s;ion are then e&s;&s;entially different when the Ora|tor &s;trikes the Imagination with fictitious Images, in which ca&s;e Fal&s;ehood becomes apparent Truth, and Eloquence the In&s;tru|ment

of Deceit; yet the Ends of Per&s;ua&s;ion and Conviction, Opinion and Knowledge <HI>concur,</HI> when &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions are made on the Imagination and Pa&s;&s;ions, as con&s;i&s;t with the Dictates of right Rea&s;on. In this ca&s;e, Eloquence comes in to the Aid of Argu|ment, and <HI>impre&s;&s;es</HI> the Truths which Lo|gic teaches, in a warmer and more effectual Manner. It paints real Good and Evil in all the glowing Colours of Imagination, and thus inflames the Heart with double Ardor to embrace the one, and reject the other.</P>
<P>NAY, &s;o far is Eloquence from being the univer&s;al In&s;trument of practical Deceit; that on the contrary, it &s;hould &s;eem, the <HI>moral</HI> is more natural than the <HI>immoral</HI> Ap|plication of it.

<P>IT may be further ob&s;erved, that as Elo|quence is of a vague, un&s;teady Nature,
<PB N="32" REF="42">
merely relative to the Imaginations and Pa&s;|&s;ions of Mankind; &s;o there mu&s;t be &s;everal Orders or Degrees of it, &s;ubordinate to each other in Dignity, yet each perfect in their Kind. The common <HI>End</HI> of each is Per|&s;ua&s;ion: The <HI>Means</HI> are different according to the various Capacities, Fancies, and Af|fections of tho&s;e whom the Arti&s;t attempts to per&s;uade. The pathetic Orator, who throws a <HI>Congregation</HI> of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> into Tears and Groanings, would rai&s;e Affections of a very different Nature, &s;hould he at|tempt to pro&s;elyte an <HI>Engli&s;h Parliament:</HI> As on the other hand, the fine&s;t Speaker that ever commanded <HI>the Hou&s;e,</HI> would in vain point the Thunder of his Eloquence on a <HI>Quaker-meeting.</HI> So again, with re|gard to the Oratory (if it may be called &s;o) of the <HI>Bar,</HI> at a <HI>Country A&s;&s;ize</HI> (for the higher Courts of Ju&s;tice admit not Elo|quence) it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, what a different Tour the learned Council takes, in ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the <HI>Judge</HI> or <HI>Jury:</HI> He is well aware, that what pa&s;&s;es with the <HI>one</HI> for <HI>Argument</HI> of Proof, would be derided by the <HI>other</HI> as pa&s;tboard <HI>Declamation.</HI> This Difference in the Kind, with re&s;pect to the Eloquence of the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> is no le&s;s remark|able

<P>HENCE too, and hence alone, we may account for a Fact, which, however, &s;eem|ingly improbable, is too well-known to be doubted of: <Q REND="inline">"That although in <HI>France,</HI> the applauded Pulpit Eloquence is of the

<P>IN further Proof of this Principle, we may appeal to ancient Fact: To the Pro|gre&s;s of Eloquence in <HI>Greece.</HI> There we find, it fir&s;t appeared, decked in all the glow|ing Colours of Poetry: afterwards, in an
<PB N="35" REF="45">
Age of more poli&s;hed Manners and exten|&s;ive Knowledge, when the Rhetors at|tempted to carry this Kind of Eloquence to a &s;till higher Degree, they found the Times would not bear it: They were baffled in their Attempt. As &s;ucceeding Ages grew more knowing, they grew more fa&s;tidious and refined: The Orators were obliged gradually to lower and bring down Elo|quence from its high Standard: Till at length it gained a Form and Character en|tirely new, as we find it in XENOPHON's cha&s;ti&s;ed Manner of <HI>Attic</HI> Elegance<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See the Pa&s;&s;age quoted above from Strabo, p. 22. &sect; 3.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO conclude with one Proof more in Fa|vour of this Principle. It appears that the&s;e different Kinds were acknowledged &s;uffici|ently in ancient <HI>Rome;</HI> though the true Di&s;tinction between them &s;eems not to have been thoroughly perceived, unle&s;s by TULLY him&s;elf.

<PB N="36" REF="46">
were the Debates concerning the &s;uperior Force and Propriety of <HI>this</HI> or the more <HI>elevated Manner.</HI> The Patrons of the <HI>Attic</HI> Style derided CICERO, as being <HI>loo&s;e, tumid,</HI> and <HI>exuberant</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">Con&s;tat, nec Ciceroni quidem obtrectatores defui&s;&s;e, quibus inflatus et tumens, nec &s;atis pre&s;&s;us, &s;upra mo|dum exultans, et &s;uperfluens, et <HI>parum Atticus</HI> videretur. <BIBL>Dialog. apud Tacit.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE>: On the contrary, he too had his Partizans, who de&s;pi&s;ed the calm and correct Species, as void of Energy and Power<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">Mihi falli multum videntur, qui &s;olos e&s;&s;e Atticos cre|dunt, tenues et lucidos et &s;ignificantes, &s;ed quadam elo|quentiae frugalitate contentos, ac manum &s;emper intra pallium continentes. <BIBL>Quintil.</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE>. Thus by overlooking the <HI>relative</HI> Nature of Eloquence, they mutually fell into an Extreme; both forgetting, that ei|ther of the&s;e Kinds might be of &s;uperior Propriety and Force, according to the Ima|ginations, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Capacities of tho&s;e to whom they &s;hould be applied. But TULLY, with a &s;uperior Sagacity, &s;aw clear|ly where the true Di&s;tinction lay: For, &s;peaking of CALVUS, a Patronizer of the <HI>Attic</HI> Manner, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"HENCE his Elo|quence gained a high Reputation among <HI>the Learned and Attentive;</HI> but among

<P>NOW among the&s;e &s;everal Kinds of Elo|quence, Ju&s;tne&s;s of Thought and Expre&s;&s;ion, &s;triking Figures, Argument adorned with every pathetic Grace, are the Characters of the <HI>highe&s;t:</HI> Sophi&s;try and Buffoonry, am|biguous and di&s;hone&s;t Hints, coar&s;e Lan|guage, fal&s;e and indecent Images, are the Characters of the <HI>lowe&s;t.</HI> Between the&s;e two Extremes, there lies a Variety of inter|mediate Kinds, each a&s;cending towards the highe&s;t, in Proportion as they abound with its proper Characters. For as the Imagi|nation and Pa&s;&s;ions are then mo&s;t refined and ju&s;t, when they bear to the &s;ame Point with Rea&s;on; &s;o, that Species of Eloquence is the noble&s;t which tends to conduct them thither<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">Les Egyptiens comparoient ceux qui preferent le co|loris au de&s;&s;ein dans la peinture, &agrave; ceux qui en matiere d'eloquence et de poe&s;ie preferent les pen&s;&eacute;es brillantes aux pen&s;&eacute;es ju&s;tes.

On this Principle, and on this
<PB N="38" REF="48">
alone, we may with Propriety and Preci&s;ion determine the comparative Excellence and Dignity of tho&s;e who a&s;pire to the Palm of Eloquence. On this Principle it &s;eems to be, that a &s;evere, but able, Judge prefers DEMOSTHENES to TULLY<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Dr. Swift's Letter to a Young Clergyman.</BIBL></NOTE>: and on this Principle he de&s;erves the Preference.</P>
<P>THUS we are at length arrived at the Point where Eloquence and Argument, Per&s;ua&s;ion and Conviction unite; where the Orator's Art becomes &s;ub&s;ervient to the In|tere&s;ts of <HI>Truth,</HI> and only labours to adorn and recommend Her.</P>
<P>WE come now to the third Species of Compo&s;ition, that of <HI>Argument:</HI> Which applying &s;olely to the Rea&s;on of Man, and to the Proof or Inve&s;tigation of Truth, is of a more &s;imple and uncompounded Na|ture in its Principles, and therefore needs not to be &s;o particularly explained. For Plea&s;ure being the primary End of Poetry, and Per&s;ua&s;ion that of Eloquence, the real Nature of Things is often in Part di&s;gui&s;ed, and compelled to bend to the Imagination
<PB N="39" REF="49">
and the Pa&s;&s;ions: But <HI>Truth</HI> being the End of Argument, the varying Colours of Ima|gination and Pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be drawn off; and human Rea&s;on it&s;elf bend to the real, uniform Nature of Things.</P>
<P>YET on this Occa&s;ion it may be proper to remark, that the <HI>rational Faculty</HI> in Man cannot be comprehen&s;ive or perfect in its Operations, without a Union with a <HI>&s;trong Imagination.</HI> And this, not only in the Arts of Poetry or Eloquence, but in the <HI>&s;evere&s;t Inve&s;tigations</HI> of Truth. For Rea&s;on alone cannot &s;earch out new Ideas, but only com|pare and di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e which Sen&s;e and Imagination pre&s;ent to her, and the Sen&s;es being of &s;mall Extent, Imagination is there|fore the great univer&s;al In&s;trument of hu|man Knowledge and human Action. With|out the Aids of Imagination therefore, Rea|&s;on works in a contracted Sphere; being de&s;titute of Materials; unable to make the nece&s;&s;ary Excur&s;ions into the Immen&s;ity of Nature; and wanting that Power which alone can range through the whole Extent of created Being, and bring Home all the po&s;&s;ible and apparent Analogies of Things, &s;etting them before her di&s;cerning Eye, and &s;ubmitting them to her &s;overeign Appro|bation
<PB N="40" REF="50">
or Di&s;like. From this noble Union ari&s;es that <HI>boundle&s;s Penetration,</HI> which &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;eth <HI>mere Judgment:</HI> and which, ac|cording as it is exerted in Poetry, Eloquence, Philo&s;ophy, Morals, or Religion, &s;trikes into the various and untroden Paths of Nature and Truth; forms the di&s;tingui&s;hed Names of HOMER, SHAKESPEAR, MILTON, DE|MOSTHENES, TULLY, ARISTOTLE, BACON, LOCKE, BAYLE, PASCAL, NEWTON, HOOKER, BERKLEY, WARBURTON, giving that e&s;&s;ential Superiority and Preheminence, which hath ever been, fir&s;t the <HI>Envy,</HI> and then the <HI>Admiration</HI> of Mankind.</P>
<P>THUS as it appeared above, how nece&s;&s;ary the Re&s;traints of Rea&s;on are, to the Per|fection of Works of Imagination; &s;o here it is evident, that a full Union of Imagi|nation is nece&s;&s;ary to the perfect Operations of Rea&s;on. Taken &s;ingly, they are each <HI>defective:</HI> When their Powers are joined, they con&s;titute TRUE GENIUS.</P>
<P>BUT, however requi&s;ite the Force of Ima|gination may be, to the Perfection of Rea|&s;on, and the Production of <HI>true Genius,</HI> yet &s;till Rea&s;on remains the &s;uperior and cor|rective Power: Therefore every Repre|&s;entation of Poetry or Eloquence, which
<PB N="41" REF="51">
only apply to the Fancy and Affections, mu&s;t finally be examined and decided upon, mu&s;t be <HI>tried, rejected,</HI> or <HI>received,</HI> as the <HI>rea|&s;oning Faculty</HI> &s;hall <HI>determine.</HI></P>

<P>HE who would judge aright of the Proportions of a &s;pacious Dome, mu&s;t not creep from one Corner to another by the Help of a glimmering Taper, but rather light up a central Branch, which may illu|minate the whole at once. By doing &s;ome|thing like this in our Remarks on the three different Kinds of Compo&s;ition, we have enabled the intelligent Reader to &s;ee with ea&s;e: <Q REND="inline">"That Wit, Raillery, and Ri|dicule, in every Shape they can po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume, are no other than &s;o many Species of <HI>Poetry</HI> or <HI>Eloquence.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>PURE <HI>Wit,</HI> when not applied to the Cha|racters of Men, is properly a Species of Poe|try. It amu&s;es and delights the Imagi|nation by tho&s;e &s;udden A&s;&s;emblages and plea&s;ing Pictures of Things which it creates: and from every common Occa&s;ion can rai&s;e
<PB N="42" REF="52">
&s;uch &s;triking Appearances, as throw the mo&s;t phlegmatic Tempers into a Convul&s;ion of good-humoured Mirth, and <HI>unde&s;igning Laughter.</HI></P>
<P>BUT <HI>Ridicule</HI> or <HI>Raillery,</HI> which is the Subject of our Inquiry, hath a further Scope and Intention. It &s;olely regards the Opi|nions, Pa&s;&s;ions, Actions, and Characters of Men: and may properly be denominated <Q REND="inline">"that Species of Writing which excites Contempt with Laughter."</Q></P>
<P>STILL more particularly we may ob|&s;erve, that as Eloquence in general is but the Application of Poetry to the End of Per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;o Ridicule in particular is no more than the Application of that particu|lar Species of Poetry called Wit, to the &s;ame End of Per&s;ua&s;ion. It tends to excite <HI>Con|tempt,</HI> in the &s;ame Manner as the other Modes of Eloquence rai&s;e Love, Pity, Ter|ror, Rage, or Hatred, in the <HI>Heart</HI> of Man.</P>
<P>NOW, that <HI>Contempt</HI> which certain Ob|jects rai&s;e in the Mind, is a particular <HI>Mode of Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> The Objects of this Pa&s;&s;ion are apparent <HI>Fal&s;ehood, Incongruity, Impropriety,</HI> or <HI>Turpitude</HI> of certain Kinds. But as the Object of every excited Pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be examined by Rea&s;on ere we can determine
<PB N="43" REF="53">
whether it be proper or improper, real or fictitious; &s;o, every Object that excites Contempt mu&s;t fall under this general Rule. Thus, before it can be determined whether our Contempt be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> Rea&s;on alone mu&s;t <HI>examine</HI> Circum&s;tances, &s;eparate Ideas, di&s;tin|gui&s;h Truth from its Appearances, decide upon, re&s;train, and <HI>correct the Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Ridicule</HI> is no other than a <HI>Species of Eloquence:</HI> and accordingly we find it mentioned and expre&s;ly treated as &s;uch, by the be&s;t Writers of Antiquity. ARISTO|TLE, as in every Subject, leads the Way. <Q REND="inline">"As Ridicule &s;eems to be of &s;ome U&s;e in <HI>pleading,</HI> it was the Opinion of GORGIAS, that you ought to confound your Adver|&s;ary's <HI>&s;erious Argument</HI> by <HI>Raillery,</HI> and his <HI>Raillery</HI> by <HI>&s;erious Argument.</HI> And he judged well<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> <BIBL>Ari&s;t.

<P>QUINTILIAN builds chiefly on TULLY, when he treats of Ridicule in the &s;ixth Book of his In&s;titutions.

<P>NOW, in Con&s;equence of the&s;e Proofs, a few Ob&s;ervations will naturally ari&s;e with regard to <HI>Ridicule in particular,</HI> &s;imilar to tho&s;e which were made in the la&s;t Section, upon <HI>Eloquence in general.</HI></P>
<P>AS fir&s;t: Ridicule mu&s;t render every Pro|po&s;ition it &s;upports <HI>apparently true,</HI> ere it can be received and acquie&s;ced it. Thus every Opinion which Ridicule in&s;tills, tho' it be the pure Re&s;ult of certain Images im|pre&s;&s;ed on the Imagination, by which the Pa&s;&s;ion of Contempt is excited, is always
<PB N="46" REF="56">
regarded as the Conviction of Rea&s;on, and received by the Mind as Truth. And thus by offering apparent Truth, Ridicule gains its End of Per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>AGAIN, it may be ob&s;erved, that the Con&s;equences of Ridicule with regard to <HI>&s;peculative</HI> In&s;truction or Inquiry, are of a very different Nature from tho&s;e which re|late to Morals and Action. To the fir&s;t it mu&s;t ever be an <HI>Enemy:</HI> But to the latter it may be an Enemy or Friend according as it is fairly or di&s;hone&s;tly applied. It comes in to the Aid of Argument, when its Im|pre&s;&s;ions on the Imagination and Pa&s;&s;ions are con&s;i&s;tent with the real Nature of Things: When it &s;trikes the Fancy and Af|fections with fictitious Images, it becomes the In&s;trument of Deceit.</P>
<P>THUS Ridicule may befriend either Truth or Fal&s;ehood: and as it is morally or im|morally applied, may illu&s;trate the one, or di&s;gui&s;e the other. Yet it &s;hould &s;eem, that the moral is more natural, than the immoral Application of Ridicule; ina&s;much as Truth is more congenial to the Mind than Fal&s;e|hood, and &s;o, the <HI>real</HI> more ea&s;ily made <HI>apparent,</HI> than the <HI>&s;ictitious</HI> Images of Things.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="57">
RIDICULE, therefore, being of a vague, un&s;teady Nature, merely relative to the Imaginations and Pa&s;&s;ions of Mankind, there mu&s;t be &s;everal Orders or Degrees of it, &s;uited to the Fancies and Capacities of tho&s;e whom the Arti&s;t attempts to influence. Among the&s;e &s;everal Kinds of Ridicule, Ju&s;tne&s;s of Thought and Expre&s;&s;ion, adorn|ed with &s;triking Figures, is the <HI>highe&s;t:</HI> Coar&s;e Language, Buffoonry, fal&s;e and inde|cent Images, are the Characters of the <HI>low|e&s;t.</HI> For as the Imagination and Pa&s;&s;ions are then mo&s;t refined and ju&s;t, when they bear to the &s;ame Point with Rea&s;on; &s;o, that Species of Ridicule is mo&s;t genuine which tends to conduct them thither.</P>
<P>BUT, however Ridicule may <HI>impre&s;s</HI> the Idea of apparent Turpitude or Fal&s;e|hood on the Imagination; yet &s;till Rea&s;on remains the &s;uperior and corrective Power. Therefore, every Repre&s;entation of Ridi|cule, which only applies to the Fancy and Affections, mu&s;t <HI>finally</HI> be <HI>examined</HI> and <HI>de|cided</HI> upon, mu&s;t be <HI>tried, rejected,</HI> or <HI>re|ceived,</HI> as the <HI>rea&s;oning Faculty</HI> &s;hall <HI>deter|mine.</HI></P>

<P>IN further Confirmation of the&s;e Truths, the direct Proofs of which may po&s;&s;ibly lie &s;omewhat remote from common Appre|hen&s;ion, let us appeal to Experience; to the general Sen&s;e and Practice of Mankind.

<P>FOR in Fact, do not we &s;ee every diffe|rent Party and A&s;&s;ociation of Men de&s;pi&s;ing and deriding each other according to their various Manner of Thought, Speech, and Action? Does not the Courtier deride the Foxhunter, and the Foxhunter the Cour|tier? What is more ridiculous to a Beau, than a Philo&s;opher; to a Philo&s;opher, than a Beau?

<P>BUT what need we wonder that a Diffe|rence of Opinion in &s;uch weighty Affairs as tho&s;e of Government and Religion &s;hould in&s;pire a mutual Contempt, when we &s;ee that any con&s;iderable Variation of Manners in the mo&s;t ordinary Circum&s;tances of Life has the &s;ame Effect?

<P>THE Cau&s;e might be &s;afely re&s;ted here. Yet, to throw a &s;till clearer Light on the Subject of our Enquiry, let us now examine what his Lord&s;hip hath advanced in Sup|port of his new Method of Inve&s;tigation.
<PB N="55" REF="65">
And as the noble Writer hath not thought it expedient to de&s;cend often to the argu|mentative Way; we mu&s;t make the mo&s;t of what we find in him that looks like a Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>HE tells his Friend, that <Q REND="inline">"nothing is ri|diculous except what is deformed; nor is any thing Proof again&s;t Raillery, except what is hand&s;ome and ju&s;t:&mdash;one may defy the World to turn real Bravery and Genero&s;ity into Ridicule.

<P>HERE we have a Mixture of equivocal Language and pompous Declamation. If he means to a&s;&s;ert, that <Q REND="inline">"nothing is ridicu|lous, except what is <HI>apparently</HI> deform|ed,"</Q> the Propo&s;ition is true, but foreign to the Purpo&s;e: Becau&s;e, through the Er|ror of Imagination, Things <HI>apparently de|formed</HI> may be <HI>really beautiful.</HI> If he means to a&s;&s;ert, that <Q REND="inline">"nothing can be made to ap|pear ridiculous, but what is <HI>really</HI> de|formed,"</Q> I &s;hould be glad to know where the noble Author had conver&s;ed: In the
<PB N="56" REF="66">
<HI>Platonic Republic,</HI> it may be &s;o: But, in our <HI>Gothic</HI> Sy&s;tems, Matters go quite otherwi&s;e: So far as common Ob&s;ervation reaches, it is ea&s;ie&s;t of all Things to make that <HI>appear</HI> ri|diculous, which is not <HI>really</HI> deformed: And how &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e, while the human Imagination is liable to be impo&s;ed on, and capable of receiving <HI>fictitious</HI> for <HI>real</HI> Repre&s;entations?</P>
<P>THE noble Author tells us next, that <Q REND="inline">"nothing is Proof again&s;t Raillery, except what is hand&s;ome and ju&s;t."</Q>&mdash;Perhaps, nor <HI>that</HI> neither. Though it be true, that nothing of the oppo&s;ite Kind is proof again&s;t Raillery; yet &s;ure it is a &s;trange Mi&s;take to imagine, that what is really hand&s;ome and ju&s;t is always Proof again&s;t it. For, by &s;ictitious Images impre&s;&s;ed on the Fancy, what is <HI>really</HI> hand&s;ome and ju&s;t, is often rendered <HI>apparently</HI> fal&s;e and deformed; and thus becomes <HI>actually</HI> contemptible and ridiculous.</P>

then can he <HI>de&s;y the World to turn real Bra|very or Genero&s;ity into Ridicule, or laugh &s;uc|ce&s;sfully at Hone&s;ty or Good-manners?</HI> And where was the Wonder or Improbability, that the Wit of ARISTOPHANES &s;hould in|cite a <HI>lewd Multitude</HI> to de&s;troy the <HI>divine Philo&s;opher</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">L'Impudence qu'il avoit de tourner en ridicule la re|ligion, devoit &ecirc;tre reprim&eacute;e: car une refutation &s;erieu&s;e ne fait pas &agrave; beaucoup pr&egrave;s tant de mal, que les raille|ries d'un homme d'e&s;prit.

<PB N="67" REF="77">
it mu&s;t be owned, the Imagination acquires a certain <HI>Delicacy,</HI> which the <HI>low Vulgar</HI> are generally Strangers to.

Thus it mu&s;t indeed be a <HI>finer,</HI> but by no means a <HI>truer</HI> Kind of Wit, that takes with the <HI>Men of Breed|ing.</HI></P>
<P>THE noble Writer proceeds to a&s;k, <Q REND="inline">"What Rule or Mea&s;ure is there in the World, except in the con&s;idering the real Temper of Things, to find which are truly &s;erious, and which ridiculous? And how can this be done, unle&s;s by applying
<PB N="68" REF="78">
the Ridicule, to &s;ee whether it will bear<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vol. i. p. 12.</BIBL></NOTE>?"</Q>&mdash;Yes &s;ure, there is another Rule: The Rule of Rea&s;on: Which alone can di&s;tingui&s;h Appearances from Realities, and fix the true Nature of Things: From who&s;e Determinations alone, we ever can di&s;tin|gui&s;h true from pretended Gravity, ju&s;t from groundle&s;s Raillery. But the Way of Inve&s;tigation here propo&s;ed by his Lord&s;hip, inverts the very Order and Con&s;titution of Things: By this means Appearances take the Place of Realities; Imagination u&s;urps the Sovereignty which belongs to Rea&s;on; and RIDICULE IS MADE THE TEST OF WHAT IS RATIONAL, INSTEAD OF REA|SON BEING MADE THE TEST OF WHAT IS RIDICULOUS.</P>
<P>YET &s;till the noble Author &s;u&s;pects ill Con&s;equences: That Subjects <Q REND="inline">"may be very grave and weighty <HI>in our Imagination,</HI> but very ridiculous and impertinent in their own Nature<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid p. 11.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> True: and on the other hand, Things may appear ridiculous and impertinent <HI>in our Imagination,</HI> which are very grave and weighty in their own Na|ture. What then is the Con&s;equence in either Ca&s;e? Why, only this: That <HI>Ima|gination,</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="79">
and therefore <HI>Ridicule</HI> which de|pends upon it, can never be a <HI>Te&s;t</HI> of Truth.</P>
<P>BUT his Lord&s;hip in&s;i&s;ts, that <Q REND="inline">"Gravity is of the very E&s;&s;ence of Impo&s;ture<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vol. i. p. 11.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Yet this will do little for his Purpo&s;e, un|le&s;s he can prove too, that <Q REND="inline">"Impo&s;ture is of the E&s;&s;ence of Gravity."</Q> And if &s;o, what will become of the <HI>Enquiry concerning Virtue?</HI> Gravity, it is true, is commonly an Attendant of Impo&s;ture: And &s;o is Laugh|ter, generally &s;peaking, of Folly. With as much Rea&s;on therefore as the noble Writer infers from hence, that Gravity is Impo&s;ture, we may infer that Laughter is Folly in Di&s;|gui&s;e. In Truth, the Inference is ground|le&s;s, in both Ca&s;es. Though every Knave &s;hould affect Gravity, yet every grave Man is not a Knave: Though every Fool will be Laughing, yet every Man that laughs is not a Fool: We may be &s;erious and hone&s;t, as well as merry and wi&s;e. Mirth and Gra|vity are both harmle&s;s Things, provided they be properly applied: And we have &s;een that it is the Province of Rea&s;on alone, to determine when they are &s;o.</P>
<P>BUT after all, the Propo&s;ition, that <HI>Gra|vity is of the E&s;&s;ence of Impo&s;ture,</HI> is fal&s;e:
<PB N="70" REF="80">
It is only an occa&s;ional, though, indeed, a pretty clo&s;e, attendant, &s;ince this other Maxim was taken for granted, that <HI>Rea&s;on was the Te&s;t of Truth.</HI> Let once his Lord|&s;hip's be generally embraced, that <HI>Ridicule</HI> is &s;o, and we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee <HI>Buffoonry</HI> as clo&s;e an Attendant on Impo&s;ture as now <HI>Gravity.</HI> The Tryal has been made; and &s;ucce&s;sfully enough too, by him who has kept the Multitude in Opinion for twenty Years together; and by this Time, perhaps, him&s;elf, that Learning and Religion are bet|ter taught in his Conventicle, than in all the Univer&s;ities and Churches of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> put together. And &s;ure if any thing be the <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of his <HI>Impo&s;ture,</HI> it is <HI>Buffoonry.</HI></P>
<P>AND here let us not forget to ob&s;erve, that the noble Writer often (as in the Pa&s;|&s;age la&s;t cited) confounds <HI>Mirth, Urbanity,</HI> or <HI>Good-humour,</HI> with <HI>Raillery</HI> or <HI>Ridicule:</HI> Than which, no two Things in Nature are more diametrically oppo&s;ite. The fir&s;t, as it ari&s;eth &s;olely from <HI>&s;udden</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ing Re|&s;emblances</HI> impre&s;&s;ed on the Imagination, is ju&s;tly regarded by all, as the be&s;t <HI>Mediator</HI> in every Debate. The la&s;t, as it ari&s;eth &s;olely from <HI>Contempt,</HI> is therefore no le&s;s ju&s;tly regarded by mo&s;t, as an <HI>Embroiler</HI> and
<PB N="71" REF="81">
<HI>Incendiary.</HI> He &s;ets out with a formal Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of proving the Efficacy of Humour and Ridicule in the Inve&s;tigation of Truth: Yet, by &s;hifting and mixing his Terms, he generally &s;lides in&s;en&s;ibly into mere Enco|miums on <HI>Good-breeding, Chearfulne&s;s, Ur|banity,</HI> and <HI>free Enquiry;</HI> and then, from the&s;e Premi&s;es, often draws Con&s;equences in Favour of <HI>Ridicule,</HI> as if it were an <HI>equi|valent Term.</HI> This indeed keeps &s;ome|thing like an Argument on Foot, and mi&s;|leads the &s;uperficial Reader.</P>
<P>BUT the noble Author triumphs in an|other Ob&s;ervation: When &s;peaking of <HI>mo|dern Zealots,</HI> he tells us, that <Q REND="inline">"whatever they think grave and &s;olemn, they &s;up|po&s;e mu&s;t never be treated out of a grave and &s;olemn Way. Though what another thinks &s;o, they can be contented to treat otherwi&s;e: And are forward to try the Edge of Ridicule again&s;t any Opinions be|&s;ides their own<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vol. i. p. 60.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Now, if this be &s;o; how is <HI>Gravity of the E&s;&s;ence of Impo&s;ture,</HI> as he had before affirmed? But whatever becomes of that Propo&s;ition, the Remark is ju&s;t. And whom&s;oever he means to Com|pliment with the Name of <HI>Zealots,</HI> whe|ther
<PB N="72" REF="82">
in Religion or Freethinking, I &s;hall not compliment as Exceptions to the Truth of it. There is &s;carce a Topic of Religion, either for its Di&s;honour or Support, that hath not been expo&s;ed to the illiberal Jokes of &s;ome Bungler in Controver&s;y. And a much coar&s;er Advocate in the Cau&s;e of Ri|dicule<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Suppo&s;ed to be Mr. Collins.</NOTE>, hath wrote an elaborate and mo&s;t te|dious Di&s;&s;ertation, to prove that the Way of Raillery hath been &s;ucce&s;sfully applied by every Sect of Religioni&s;ts and Infidels, to the De&s;truction of each other's Tenets, and the E&s;tabli&s;hment of their own. How he gains his Conclu&s;ion, that an Engine which tends to fix Mankind in their preconceived Opinions, and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;o many Species of Error, is of Importance and Efficacy in the Search of Truth, may not be &s;o ea&s;y to de|termine. In the mean time, in Reply to his whole Treati&s;e, as well as to the la&s;t mentioned Remark of our noble Author, it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that Mankind often retain their own, and oppo&s;e others' Opinions, from an imperfect View of the Nature of Things: Their peculiar Tenets in Religion, as in other Subjects, are often founded in Imagination only: Their Ob|jections
<PB N="73" REF="83">
to tho&s;e of others are often as groundle&s;s and fanciful. How natural then is it for them to communicate their Opi|nions on that Foundation on which they re|ceived them? How natural, that they &s;hould throw the Colours of Imagination on the Tenets they oppo&s;e? That they &s;hould ob|trude the like fictitious Images on others, which them&s;elves have embraced as Truth? That they &s;hould hold forth Appearances for Realities; employ Eloquence in&s;tead of Logick; and endeavour to <HI>per&s;uade</HI> whom they &s;hould, but cannot, <HI>convince?</HI></P>
<P>IT &s;eems therefore that his Lord&s;hip's Ob&s;ervation (which contains the Quinte&s;|&s;ence of his A&s;&s;ociate's Work, and which probably was the <HI>Leaven</HI> that <HI>leavened</HI> the whole <HI>Lump</HI> of Malice and Dulne&s;s) in&s;tead of being favourable to Ridicule as a Te&s;t of Truth, can only tend to di&s;grace it. For &s;ince every religious and unbelieving Sect hath <HI>alike &s;ucce&s;sfully</HI> employed it in &s;upport|ing their re&s;pective Tenets, and in render|ing tho&s;e of their Adver&s;aries contemptible; it follows, ina&s;much as Doctrines which are e&s;&s;entially repugnant cannot all be true, that RIDICULE IS ONE OF THE MOST POWER|FUL

<P>HE tells us, that a new Species of En|thu&s;ia&s;ts <HI>(French Prophets)</HI> having lately ri&s;en up among us, <Q REND="inline">"We have delivered them over to the cruelle&s;t Contempt in the World.

<P><PB N="75" REF="85">
SO far, for Peace &s;ake, we venture to agree with the noble Writer: But now comes a fini&s;hing Stroke indeed.</P>
<P>FOR he proceeds to congratulate the pre|&s;ent Age, that in the Beginnings of the Re|formation, when Popery had got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>Smithfield</HI> was u&s;ed in a more <HI>tragical Way.</HI> And that <Q REND="inline">"had not the Prie&s;ts, as is u&s;ual, preferred the Love of Blood to all other Pa&s;&s;ions, they might in a <HI>merrier Way,</HI> perhaps, have <HI>evaded the greate&s;t Force of our reforming Spirit</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vol. i. p. 28.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>AND now, for Form's &s;ake, let us &s;uppo&s;e the noble Author to be what he a&s;&s;umes, a Friend to Religion and Reformation: Un|der this Character, he recommends <HI>Ridicule</HI> to us, as of &s;overeign U&s;e to inve&s;tigate Truth, try Hone&s;ty, and unma&s;k formal Hypocri&s;y and Error. To prove this U&s;e, he tells us, what we &s;hould lea&s;t have ex|pected, that if, in&s;tead of the tragical Way of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts had pre|ferred the comic Drollery of Bart'lmy-Fair, they had perhaps gained their Point, and <HI>evaded the greate&s;t Force of our reforming Spirit.</HI> Here the noble Writer forgets his Part, which is that of a <HI>Believer</HI> and a <HI>Pro|te&s;tant.</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="86">
But, in his Scarcity of Proofs for the <HI>U&s;e</HI> of Ridicule, he has put the Change upon us, and perhaps upon him&s;elf, and offered at one to &s;hew its <HI>Force:</HI> Which, without doubt, mu&s;t wonderfully recom|mend it to the Favour of all &s;ober Men. Here then lies the Dilemma: Let his Fol|lowers then get him off as they can. If their Ma&s;ter be a Believer, he has rea&s;oned ill; if a Freethinker, he has managed wor&s;e. Had he been a little more knowing in the Times he &s;peaks of, he might have found an In&s;tance more pertinent to his Argu|ment, and more conformable to his Cha|racter; an In&s;tance which &s;hews, not what <HI>Ridicule</HI> might be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of do|ing, but what it actually effected.

<P>HOWEVER, the noble Writer's Mo|de&s;ty mu&s;t not be forgotten. For while he
<PB N="81" REF="91">
might have arrogated to him&s;elf the Glory of this wondrous Di&s;covery, he hath in|formed us of an <HI>ancient Sage,</HI> who&s;e Idea of Ridicule coincided with his own. <Q REND="inline">"'Twas the Saying of an ancient Sage, that Humour was the only Te&s;t of Gra|vity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vol. i. p. 74.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>THE Reader will probably be &s;urprized to find that the Pa&s;&s;age here referred to by the noble Writer, is no other than what hath been already quoted from ARISTO|TLE<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, p. 43.</BIBL></NOTE> as a Direction to the Conduct of an Orator. 'Tis likewi&s;e remarkable, that his Lord&s;hip, in quoting the original Pa&s;&s;age in his <HI>Margin,</HI> has, by the <HI>prudent</HI> Omi&s;&s;ion of an emphatical Expre&s;&s;ion, converted it from a particular Rule of Rhetoric into a general Maxim of Philo&s;ophy<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The Words, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">&mdash;<HI>Adver&s;ariorum</HI>&mdash;are omitted.</NOTE>. But 'tis of all mo&s;t remarkable, that in his pretended Tran&s;lation, he hath entirely perverted the Sen&s;e of the Author, who&s;e Authority he attempts to build upon.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"As Ridicule (&s;ays the great Philo&s;o|pher) &s;eems to be of &s;ome U&s;e in Plead|ing; it was the Opinion of GORGIAS,
<PB N="82" REF="92">
that you ought to confound your Adver|&s;ary's &s;erious Argument by Raillery, and his Raillery by &s;erious Argument."</Q> This is almo&s;t a literal Tran&s;lation of the Pa&s;|&s;age. But how the noble Author could &s;o far impo&s;e upon him&s;elf or others, as to &s;trip it of its native Dre&s;s, and di&s;gui&s;e it under the fanta&s;tical Appearance of a Maxim, <Q REND="inline">"that Humour is the only Te&s;t of Gravity, and Gravity of Humour,"</Q>&mdash;this is not &s;o ea&s;y to account for.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this came to pa&s;s, 'tis cer|tain, that the Ob&s;ervation, as it lies in ARI|STOTLE, is a ju&s;t and a fine one: as it lies in the noble Writer's maimed Tran&s;lation, it is <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> if not <HI>unmeaning.</HI></P>
<P>THAT an Orator &s;hould <HI>confound his Ad|ver&s;ary's Raillery by &s;erious Argument,</HI> is ra|tional and ju&s;t. By this means he tears off the fal&s;e Di&s;gui&s;es of Eloquence, and di&s;|tingui&s;heth real from apparent Truth. That he &s;hould <HI>confound his Adver&s;ary's &s;erious Argument by Raillery,</HI> is, if not a ju&s;t, yet a legal Practice. The Aim and End of the Advocate or Orator is Per&s;ua&s;ion only; to Truth or Fal&s;ehood as it happens. If he hath Truth on his Side, it is likely what he will have then to do, will be <HI>to confound his</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="93">
<HI>Adver&s;ary's Raillery by &s;erious Argument.</HI> If Truth be again&s;t him, he will be forced to change Weapons with his Adver&s;ary, <HI>who&s;e &s;erious Argument he mu&s;t try to con|found by Raillery.</HI> This is all the My&s;tery there is in the Matter? By which we &s;ee, that whenever in this ca&s;e Ridicule is op|po&s;ed to Rea&s;oning, it is &s;o far from being the <HI>Te&s;t</HI> or Support, that it is the <HI>De&s;truction</HI> of <HI>Truth.</HI> And the judicious QUINTILIAN fairly confe&s;&s;es it, where he a&s;&s;igns the Cau&s;e why Ridicule is of &s;uch mighty Force in Oratory&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Quia animum ab in|tentione rerum frequenter avertit"</Q>&mdash;<HI>Be|cau&s;e it draws off the Mind from attending to the real Nature of Things.</HI> Thus you &s;ee the Propriety and Beauty of the <HI>Saying of our ancient Sage,</HI> when fairly repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>BUT as the noble Writer hath tran&s;lated the Pa&s;&s;age, it is a Curio&s;ity indeed. <Q REND="inline">"Hu|mour is the only Te&s;t of Gravity, and Gravity of Humour."</Q> He applies it not to Eloquence, but Philo&s;ophy; not to Per|&s;ua&s;ion, but Conviction. And &s;o, by the &s;trange&s;t Conver&s;ion in Nature, makes the Trier, and the Thing tried, each in their turns, become Agent and Patient to one an|other. But what Arti&s;t ever attempted to
<PB N="84" REF="94">
<HI>try</HI> the Ju&s;tne&s;s of his <HI>Square</HI> or <HI>Level,</HI> by the Work which he has formed by the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e In&s;truments? Or was ever the Gold which hath been put to the Te&s;t, reciprocally applied to <HI>try</HI> the Touch-Stone? If therefore <HI>Gravity,</HI> or Rea&s;oning, be the Te&s;t of <HI>Humour;</HI> Humour never can be the Te&s;t of Gravity: As on the other hand, if Humour be the Te&s;t of Gravity, then Gra|vity can never be the Te&s;t of Humour.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore this <HI>&s;ee-&s;aw</HI> Kind of Proof returns into it&s;elf, and con&s;equently ends in an Ab&s;urdity; 'tis plain, that one half of the noble Writer's Propo&s;ition mu&s;t effectually de&s;troy the other: Let us &s;ee then, which Moiety de&s;erves to be &s;up|ported. His own Comment on the Pa&s;|&s;age will help us to determine. Which however, he &s;eems de&s;irous his Reader &s;hould receive as a Part of the <HI>Saying of his ancient Sage:</HI> But whoever will turn to the Pa&s;&s;age, as it lies in ARISTOTLE, will find that GORGIAS is entirely innocent of the whole Affair.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"GRAVITY, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, is the Te&s;t of <HI>Humour:</HI> Becau&s;e a Je&s;t that will not bear a &s;erious Examination, is cer|tainly fal&s;e Wit."</Q> True: here we have a
<PB N="85" REF="95">
rational Te&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed. Next he inverts the Propo&s;ition, &s;ets it with its Head down|wards, like a Traytor's Scutcheon, and now, &s;ays he, behold <Q REND="inline">"Humour is the Te&s;t of Gravity."</Q> To prove this, Rea&s;on re|quires he &s;hould have added, <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e an Argument, which can be &s;ucce&s;sfully ri|diculed, is certainly fal&s;e Logic."</Q> But this was too hardy a Propo&s;ition to be di|rectly advanced: He therefore contents him&s;elf with hinting, that <Q REND="inline">"a Subject which will not bear Raillery <HI>is &s;u&s;picious!</HI>"</Q> Now we know, that <HI>Su&s;picion</HI> is often ground|le&s;s: That what is &s;u&s;pected to be fal&s;e, may yet be true. So that the noble Writer again &s;uffers this new Te&s;t to &s;lip through his Fingers, even while he is holding it up to your Admiration. But if any thing fur|ther be nece&s;&s;ary to clear up this Point, it may be ob&s;erved in &s;hort, that Gravity or Argument is the Te&s;t of Humour, becau&s;e Rea&s;on marks the real Differences of Things: That Humour can never be the Te&s;t of Gravity, becau&s;e Imagination can only &s;ugge&s;t their apparent Analogies.</P>
<P>THUS the Sentiment of GORGIAS is gro&s;ly mi&s;taken or de&s;ignedly mi&s;repre|&s;ented by the noble Writer: as it lies in
<PB N="86" REF="96">
ARISTOTLE, it is rational and con&s;i&s;tent; as it is taken up by his Lord&s;hip, it is chi|merical and groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>IT might have been difficult to a&s;&s;ign a Rea&s;on, why the noble Writer &s;hould have attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h this <HI>two-fold</HI> Method of Proof, had not he explained his Intention in another Place. He there<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vol. iii. Mi&s;c. v. c. 2. &sect; 65, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE> wi&s;ely re|commends the old <HI>&s;chola&s;tic Manner</HI> to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> as being mo&s;t &s;uitable to their Abi|lities and Character: The <HI>Way of Ridicule</HI> he appropriates to the Men of Ta&s;te and Breeding; declaring it ought to be kept &s;acred from the impure Touch of an Eccle|&s;ia&s;tic. For as Clubs and <HI>Cudgels</HI> have long been appropriated to Porters and Footmen, while every Gentleman is ambitious to un|der&s;tand a <HI>Sword;</HI> &s;o the clum&s;y Way of <HI>Argumentation</HI> is only fit for Prie&s;ts and Pedants, but <HI>pointed</HI> Wit is the Weapon for the Man of Fa&s;hion: This decides a Quarrel <HI>hand&s;omely.</HI> The <HI>pretty Fellow</HI> is at your Vitals in a Moment; while the Pedant keeps labouring at it for an Hour together, and neither gets nor gives &s;o much as a broken Bone.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="97">
BUT &s;till higher is the noble Writer's Idea of Wit and Ridicule: While he ap|plies it not only to <HI>Conque&s;t,</HI> but <HI>Inve&s;tiga|tion:</HI> And we mu&s;t own, it was an At|tempt worthy of his Genius, to e&s;tabli&s;h this new and <HI>expeditious</HI> Method of Search and Conviction. In which, by the &s;ole Ap|plication of &s;o cheap and <HI>portable an In|&s;trument</HI> as that of <HI>Raillery,</HI> a Gentleman might obtain the certain Knowledge of the <HI>true Proportion</HI> of Things, without the te|dious and vulgar Methods of <HI>Men&s;uration.</HI> In the mean Time, we, whom the noble Author hath &s;o often conde&s;cended to di&s;|tingui&s;h by the honourable Title of For|mali&s;ts and Pedants, finding our&s;elves inca|pable of this <HI>&s;ublime</HI> Way of Proof, mu&s;t be content to drudge on in the old and beaten Track of <HI>Rea&s;oning.</HI> And after all, 'tis probable this new Attempt will &s;ucceed no better than the curious Conceit of the <HI>learned Taylor</HI> in <HI>Laputa:</HI> Who being employed in making a <HI>Suit</HI> for the facetious GULLIVER; di&s;dained the <HI>vulgar Mea&s;ures</HI> of his Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and took that Gentleman's <HI>Altitude</HI> by the Help of a <HI>Quadrant.</HI> This, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, was a Theory no le&s;s &s;ublime than our noble Author's: Yet it

failed mi&s;erably when applied to Practice: For the &s;agacious Traveller informs us, that notwith&s;tanding the Acutene&s;s and Pene|tration of the Arti&s;t, his cloaths were <HI>wretchedly ill made.</HI></P>

<P>WE have now obviated every thing ma|terial, that the noble Writer hath advanced in Support of his new Sy&s;tem. But as one of his mo&s;t zealous Followers hath under|taken <HI>in Form</HI> to explain and defend his Notions on this Subject<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See a Note on the <HI>Plea&s;ures of Imagination,</HI> a Poem. Book iii.</BIBL></NOTE>, it may be proper to examine how far this Gentleman's Ar|gument is con&s;i&s;tent with Truth.</P>
<P>HE tells us, that <Q REND="inline">"to a&s;k whether Ridi|cule be a Te&s;t of Truth, is in other Words to a&s;k, whether that which is ri|diculous can be morally true, can be ju&s;t and becoming; or whether that which is ju&s;t and becoming, can be ridiculous."</Q></P>
<P>HERE, as the Foundation of all, we &s;ee the &s;ame Kind of Ambiguity lurking, as was ob&s;erved in the noble Writer, in the Pa&s;|&s;age already remarked on<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, p. 55.</BIBL></NOTE>. For if by <Q REND="inline">"that
<PB N="89" REF="99">
which is ridiculous,"</Q> he means that which is <HI>really</HI> ridiculous, it is allowed this can ne|ver be morally true: But this is &s;o far from proving Ridicule to be a Te&s;t of Truth, that it implies the contrary: It implies &s;ome further Power, which may be able to di&s;|tingui&s;h what is <HI>really</HI> ridiculous, from what is only <HI>apparently</HI> &s;o. On the contrary, if by <Q REND="inline">"that which is ridiculous,"</Q> he means that which is <HI>apparently</HI> ridiculous, it may be affirmed, this may be morally true: Be|cau&s;e Imagination and Pa&s;&s;ion often take up with Fictions in&s;tead of Realities, and can never of them&s;elves di&s;tingui&s;h them from each other. He tells us his Que&s;tion <Q REND="inline">"does not de&s;erve a &s;erious An&s;wer."</Q> At lea&s;t it wanted an Explanation.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman proceeds: <Q REND="inline">"For it is mo&s;t evident, that as in a metaphy&s;ical Propo&s;ition offered to the Under&s;tanding for its A&s;&s;ent, <HI>the Faculty of Rea&s;on</HI> exa|mines the Terms of the Propo&s;ition, and finding one Idea which was &s;uppo&s;ed equal to another, to be in Fact unequal, of Con&s;equence rejects the Propo&s;ition as a Fal&s;ehood: So in Objects offered to the Mind for its E&s;teem or Applau&s;e, the <HI>Faculty of Ridicule</HI> feeling an Incongruity in

<P>HERE the <HI>Faculty of Rea&s;on</HI> is excluded from the Examination of moral Truths, and a <HI>new</HI> Faculty, never before heard of, <HI>the Faculty of Ridicule,</HI> is &s;ub&s;tituted in its Place.

<P>WE &s;hall now clearly di&s;cover the Di&s;|tinction that is to be made on the following Pa&s;&s;age: <Q REND="inline">"And thus a double Advantage is gained: For we both <HI>detect</HI> the moral Fal&s;ehood <HI>&s;ooner</HI> than in the Way of &s;pe|culative Enquiry, and impre&s;s the Minds of Men with a &s;tronger Sen&s;e of the Va|nity and Error of its Authors<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid. p. 106.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q>&mdash;Here 'tis evident, that the De&s;ign <Q REND="inline">"of <HI>detecting</HI> the moral Fal&s;ehood <HI>&s;ooner</HI> than in the

<PB N="93" REF="103">
By this means we &s;hall often <Q REND="inline">"view Ob|jects of real Dignity and Excellence,"</Q> in &s;uch Shapes and Colours as are foreign to their Nature; and then &s;it down and laugh mo&s;t profoundly at the Phantoms of our own creating.</P>

<P>OBSERVE therefore what a Number of <HI>new</HI> Phra&s;es and <HI>blind</HI> Guides this of Ridi|cule, if once admitted, would bring in upon us, and all on equal Authority. For with the &s;ame Rea&s;on, as the Pa&s;&s;ion of Contempt is &s;tyled the <HI>Sen&s;e of Ridicule,</HI> the Pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Fear</HI> may be called the <HI>Sen&s;e of Danger,</HI> and <HI>Anger</HI> the <HI>Sen&s;e of Injury.</HI> But who hath ever dreamt of exalting the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions into &s;o many Te&s;ts of the Reality of their re&s;pective Objects?

Object. Now, the Scheme of Ridicule is of the &s;ame Nature. It propo&s;es the Pa&s;|&s;ion of Contempt as the Te&s;t of moral Fal&s;ehood, which, from the very Terms, appears to be a Project full as wi&s;e, as to make Fear the Te&s;t of Danger, or Anger the Te&s;t of Injury.</P>

He owns <Q REND="inline">"the SO|CRATES of ARISTOPHANES is as truly ri|diculous a Character as ever was drawn: But it is not the Character of SOCRATES, the divine Morali&s;t and Father of ancient Wi&s;dom."</Q>&mdash;No indeed: and here lay the Wickedne&s;s of the Poet's Intention, and the Danger of his Art: in impo&s;ing Fictions for Realities on the mi&s;led Multitude; and put|ting a Fool's Coat on the Father of ancient Wi&s;dom. 'Tis true, the People laughed at the <HI>ridiculous Sophi&s;t;</HI> but when the ridicu|lous Sophi&s;t came to drink the Poi&s;on, what think you became of the Father of ancient Wi&s;dom?</P>
<P>BUT then he tells us, that as the comic Poet introduced foreign Circum&s;tances into the Character of SOCRATES, and built his Ridicule upon the&s;e; <Q REND="inline">"So has the Rea&s;on|ing of SPINOZA made many Athei&s;ts;
<PB N="95" REF="105">
he has founded it indeed on Suppo&s;itions utterly fal&s;e, but allow him the&s;e, and his Conclu&s;ions are unavoidably true. And if we mu&s;t reject the U&s;e of Ridicule, becau&s;e, by the Impo&s;ition of fal&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances, things may be made to &s;eem ridiculous, which are not &s;o in them|&s;elves; why we ought not to reject the U&s;e of Rea&s;on, becau&s;e, by proceeding on fal&s;e Principles, Conclu&s;ions will appear true which are impo&s;&s;ible in Nature, let the vehement and ob&s;tinate Declaimers again&s;t Ridicule determine<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Page 106.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>BUT why &s;o much Indignation again&s;t <HI>Declaimers</HI> in one who writes in Defence of <HI>Ridicule,</HI> a Species of <HI>Declamation?</HI> Then as to <HI>rejecting</HI> the U&s;e of Ridicule, a very material Di&s;tinction is to be made: As a <HI>Mode of Eloquence</HI> nobody attempts totally to reject it, while it remains under the Do|minion of Rea&s;on: But as a <HI>Te&s;t of Truth,</HI> I hope the Reader hath &s;een &s;ufficient Rea|&s;on totally to reject it.</P>
<P>NEITHER will the Parallel by any means hold good, which the Gentleman hath at|tempted to draw between the Abu&s;e of <HI>Ri|dicule</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI> Becau&s;e the Imagina|tion,
<PB N="96" REF="106">
to which the Way of Ridicule applies, is apt to form to it&s;elf innumerable fictitious Re&s;emblances of Things which tend to con|found Truth with Fal&s;ehood: Whereas the natural Tendency of Rea&s;on is to &s;eparate the&s;e apparent Re&s;emblances, and determine which are the <HI>real,</HI> and which the <HI>fictitious.</HI> Although therefore SPINOZA hath advanced many Fal&s;ehoods in the Way of &s;peculative Affirmation, and founded his Rea&s;onings on the&s;e, yet &s;till Rea&s;on will be her own Cor|rectre&s;s, and ea&s;ily di&s;cover the Cheat. But if the Imagination be impre&s;&s;ed with fal&s;e Appearances, and the Pa&s;&s;ion of Contempt &s;trongly excited, neither the <HI>Imagination</HI> nor the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion can ever correct them&s;elves;</HI> but mu&s;t inevitably be mi&s;led, unle&s;s <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> be called in to rectify the Mi&s;take, and bring back the Pa&s;&s;ion to its proper Channel.</P>
<P>NAY, &s;o far is the U&s;e of Ridicule, when prior to rational Conviction, from being par|allel to Rea&s;on, or co-operative with it; that, on the contrary, it hath a &s;trong Ten|dency to prevent the Efforts of Rea&s;on, and to confound its Operations. It is not pre|tended that human Rea&s;on, though the <HI>ul|timate,</HI> is yet in all Ca&s;es an <HI>adequate</HI> Te&s;t of Truth: It is always fallible, often errone|ous:
<PB N="97" REF="107">
But it would be much le&s;s erroneous, were every Mode of Eloquence, and Ridi|cule above all others, kept remote from its Operations; were no Pa&s;&s;ion &s;uffered to blend it&s;elf with the Re&s;earches of the Mind. For Ridicule, working on the Ima|gination and Pa&s;&s;ions, di&s;po&s;es the Mind to receive and acquie&s;ce in any Opinion with|out its proper Evidence. Hence Preju|dice ari&s;es; and the Mind, which &s;hould be <HI>free</HI> to examine and weigh tho&s;e <HI>real</HI> Cir|cum&s;tances which PROVE SOCRATES to be indeed a divine Philo&s;opher, is drawn by the <HI>prior</HI> Sugge&s;tions of <HI>Ridicule</HI> to receive and acquie&s;ce in tho&s;e fal&s;e Circum&s;tances, which PAINT him as a <HI>contemptible Sophi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>TO conclude: 'Tis no difficult Matter to point out the Foundation of this Gentle|man's Errors concerning Ridicule. They have ari&s;en &s;olely from his mi&s;taking <HI>the Pa&s;&s;ion of Contempt</HI> for a <HI>judicial Faculty:</HI> Hence all tho&s;e new-fangled Expre&s;&s;ions of&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"the Faculty of Ridicule"&mdash;"the Sen&s;e of Ridicule"&mdash;and "the feeling of the Ridiculous:"</Q> In the U&s;e of which he &s;eems to have impo&s;ed upon him&s;elf new Phra&s;es for Realities, and Words for Things.

by tran&s;cribing a Pa&s;&s;age from the incom|parable LOCKE.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Another great Abu&s;e of Words is, the taking them for Things.

<P>TO return therefore to the noble Wri|ter. As it is evident, that <HI>Ridicule</HI> cannot in general without Ab&s;urdity be applied as a Te&s;t of Truth; &s;o can it lea&s;t of all be
<PB N="100" REF="110">
admitted in <HI>examining Religious Opinions,</HI> in the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which, his Lord&s;hip &s;eems principally to recommend it. Becau&s;e, by in&s;piring the contending Parties with <HI>mutual Contempt,</HI> it hath a violent Tendency to de|&s;troy <HI>mutual Charity,</HI> and therefore to pre|vent <HI>mutual Conviction.</HI></P>
<P>TO illu&s;trate this Truth, let us con&s;ider the following In&s;tance, which &s;eems clear and full to the Point.</P>
<P>THERE is not perhaps in any Language a bolder or &s;tronger Ridicule, than the well|known Apologue of <HI>The Tale of a Tub.</HI> Its manife&s;t De&s;ign is to recommend the <HI>Eng|li&s;h Church,</HI> and to di&s;grace the two Extremes of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Puritani&s;m</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><P>Some indeed have pretended otherwi&s;e. Thus Mr. <HI>Wotton,</HI> in his <HI>Reflections on Learning,</HI> &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"It is a de|&s;igned Banter upon all that is e&s;teemed &s;acred among Men."</Q> And the pious Author of the <HI>Independent Whig</HI> affirms it was <Q REND="inline">"the &s;ole <HI>open</HI> Attack that had been made upon <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> &s;ince the Revolution, except the <HI>Oracles of Rea&s;on,</HI> and was not inferior in Ban|ter and Malice, to the Attacks of <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> or <HI>Julian,</HI> or <HI>Porphyry,</HI> or <HI>Lucian.</HI>" p. 399.</Q> Where by the Way, the Oddity of the <HI>Contra&s;t</HI> is remarkable enough; that he &s;hould pronounce the <HI>Tale of a Tub</HI> to be a <HI>Libel on Chri&s;tianity,</HI> while it is in Fact <HI>a Vindication of our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;hment;</HI> and at the &s;ame Time entitle his own Book <HI>a Vindication of our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;h|ment,</HI> while in Fact it is <HI>a Libel on Chri&s;tianity.</HI></P></NOTE>. Now, if we
<PB N="101" REF="111">
con&s;ider this exqui&s;ite Piece of Raillery as a Te&s;t of Truth, we &s;hall find it impotent and vain: For the Que&s;tion &s;till recurs, whether MARTIN be a ju&s;t Emblem of the <HI>Engli&s;h, Jack</HI> of the <HI>Scotch,</HI> or <HI>Peter</HI> of the <HI>Roman Church.</HI> All the Points in Debate between the &s;everal Parties are taken for granted in the Repre&s;entation: And we mu&s;t have Re|cour&s;e to <HI>Argument,</HI> and to that alone, ere we can determine the Merits of the Que|&s;tion.</P>
<P>IF we next con&s;ider this Ma&s;ter-piece of Wit as a Mode of <HI>Eloquence,</HI> we &s;hall find it indeed of great <HI>Efficacy</HI> in confirm|ing every Member of the <HI>Church of England</HI> in his own Communion, and in giving him a thorough Di&s;ta&s;te of tho&s;e of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Rome:</HI> And &s;o far as this may be regarded as a Matter of <HI>public Utility,</HI> &s;o far the Ri|dicule may be laudable.</P>
<P>BUT if we extend our Views &s;o as to comprehend a larger Plan of <HI>moral U&s;e;</HI> we &s;hall find this Method of Per&s;ua&s;ion is &s;uch, as Charity can hardly approve of: For by repre&s;enting the one of the&s;e Churches un|der the Character of <HI>Craft and Knavery,</HI> the other under that of <HI>incurable Madne&s;s,</HI> it mu&s;t needs tend to in&s;pire every Member
<PB N="102" REF="112">
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church who believes the Re|pre&s;entation, with &s;uch <HI>Hatred</HI> of the one, and <HI>Contempt</HI> of the other, as to prevent all <HI>friendly Debate</HI> and <HI>rational Remon&s;trance.</HI></P>
<P>ITS effect on tho&s;e who hold the Do|ctrines of CALVIN, or of <HI>Rome,</HI> mu&s;t be yet wor&s;e: Unle&s;s it can be proved, that the Way to attract the Love, and convince the Rea&s;on of Mankind, is to &s;hew that we hate or de&s;pi&s;e them. While they revere what we deride, 'tis plain, we cannot <HI>both</HI> view the Subject in the &s;ame Light: And though we deride what appears to us <HI>con|temptible,</HI> we deride what to them appears <HI>&s;acred.</HI> They will therefore accu&s;e us of mi&s;repre&s;enting their Opinions, and abhor us as <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>impious.</HI></P>
<P>THUS although this noted Apologue be indeed a Vindication of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church, yet it is &s;uch as had been better &s;pared: Be|cau&s;e its natural Effect is to create Preju|dice, and in&s;pire the contending Parties with mutual Di&s;ta&s;te, Contempt, and Hatred.</P>
<P>BUT if the Way of Ridicule is thus wholly to be rejected in treating every <HI>con|troverted</HI> Subject; it will probably be a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">"Where then is it to be applied? Whether it is rea&s;onable <HI>to calumniate and blacken</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="113">
<HI>it without Di&s;tinction?</HI> And whether it is not Impiety, thus <HI>to vilify the Gifts of our Maker?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>AND 'tis certain, that to do this, were ab|&s;urd and impious. As on the other hand, there is an equal Ab&s;urdity and Impiety in confounding that Order of Things which the Creator hath e&s;tabli&s;hed, and endeavour|ing to rai&s;e <HI>a blind Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> into the <HI>Throne of Rea&s;on.</HI> One Party or other in this Debate hath certainly incurred the Cen&s;ure: The Cen&s;ure is &s;evere, and let it fall where it is de&s;erved. I know none that endeavour to vilify and blacken Ridicule without Di&s;|tinction, unle&s;s when it pre&s;umes to elevate it&s;elf into a <HI>Te&s;t of Truth:</HI> And then, as a Rebel to the Order and Con&s;titution of Na|ture, it ought to be re&s;olutely encountered and repelled, till it take Refuge in its own inferior Station.</P>
<P>THE proper U&s;e of Ridicule therefore is, <Q REND="inline">"to di&s;grace <HI>known</HI> Fal&s;ehood:"</Q> And thus, negatively at lea&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"to enforce <HI>known</HI> Truth."</Q> Yet this can only be affirmed of certain Kinds of Fal&s;ehood or Incon|gruity, to which we &s;eem to have appro|priated the general Name of <HI>Folly:</HI> And among the &s;everal Branches of this, chiefly
<PB N="104" REF="114">
I think, to AFFECTATION. For as every <HI>Affectation</HI> ari&s;es from a fal&s;e Pretence to <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> &s;o a <HI>Contempt incurred</HI> tends to <HI>con|vince</HI> the Claimant of his <HI>Error,</HI> and thus becomes the natural Remedy to the Evil.</P>
<P>MUCH more might be &s;aid on this Head. We might run through numerous Divi&s;ions and Subdivi&s;ions of <HI>Folly:</HI> But as the Ta&s;k would be both in&s;ignificant and endle&s;s, I am unwilling to trouble the Reader with &s;uch elaborate Trifles.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems an Ob&s;ervation more worthy of our Attention and Regard; that <HI>Contempt,</HI> whence Ridicule ari&s;es, being a <HI>&s;elfi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> and nearly allied to <HI>Pride,</HI> if not ab&s;olutely founded on it; we ought ever to keep a &s;trict Rein, and in general rather curb than forward its Emotions. Is there a more im|portant Maxim in Philo&s;ophy than this, that we &s;hould gain a Habit of controuling our Imaginations and Pa&s;&s;ions by the U&s;e of Rea&s;on? E&s;pecially tho&s;e that are rather of the &s;elfi&s;h than the benevolent Kind? That we &s;hould not &s;uffer our Fears to &s;ink us in Cowardice, our Joys in Weakne&s;s, our An|ger in Revenge? And &s;ure there is not a Pa&s;&s;ion that infe&s;ts human Life, who&s;e Con|&s;equences are &s;o generally pernicious as tho&s;e
<PB N="105" REF="115">
of <HI>indulged Contempt.</HI> As the common Occurrences of Life are the Objects which afford it Nouri&s;hment, &s;o by this means it is kept more con&s;tantly in Play, than any other Affection of the Mind: And is indeed the general In&s;trument by which Individuals, Families, Sects, Provinces, and Nations, are driven from a State of mutual Charity, into that of Bitterne&s;s and Di&s;&s;ention. We pro|ceed from Raillery to Railing; from Con|tempt to Hatred. Thus if the Love of Ri|dicule be not in it&s;elf a Pa&s;&s;ion of the male|volent Species, it leads at lea&s;t to tho&s;e which are &s;o. Add to this, that the mo&s;t ignorant are generally the mo&s;t contemptu|ous; and they the mo&s;t forward to <HI>deride,</HI> who are mo&s;t incapable or mo&s;t unwilling to <HI>under&s;tand.</HI> Narrow Conceptions of Things lead to groundle&s;s Deri&s;ion: And this Spirit of Scorn in its Turn, as it cuts us off from all Information, confirms us in our preconceived and groundle&s;s Opinions.</P>
<P>THIS being the real Nature and Ten|dency of Ridicule, it cannot be worth while to de&s;cant much on its Application, or ex|plore its Sub&s;erviency to the U&s;es of Li&s;e. For though under the &s;evere Re&s;trictions of Rea&s;on, it may be made a proper In&s;tru|ment
<PB N="106" REF="116">
on many Occa&s;ions, for di&s;gracing <HI>known Folly;</HI> yet the Turn of Levity it gives the Mind, the Di&s;ta&s;te it rai&s;es to all candid and rational Information, the Spirit of Ani|mo&s;ity it is apt to excite, the Errors in which it confirms us when its Sugge&s;tions are fal&s;e, the Extremes to which it is apt to drive us, even when its Sugge&s;tions are true; all the&s;e con&s;pire to tell us, it is rather to be wi&s;hed than hoped, that its Influence upon the whole can be con&s;iderable in the Service of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>LORD SHAFTESBURY him&s;elf, in many other Parts of his Book, &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ts on the Nece&s;&s;ity of bringing the Imagination and Pa&s;&s;ions under the Dominion of Rea|&s;on. <Q REND="inline">"The only Poi&s;on to <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> &s;ays he, is <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion:</HI> For <HI>fal&s;e Rea&s;oning</HI> is &s;oon redre&s;&s;ed, where Pa&s;&s;ion is removed<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Wit and Humour,</HI> Part ii. &sect; 1.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> And it is difficult to a&s;&s;ign any Cau&s;e that will not reflect &s;ome Di&s;honour on the no|ble Writer, why he &s;hould thus &s;trangely have attempted to privilege this Pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Contempt</HI> from &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Subjection.

<P>THE next Writer I &s;hall mention is the learned and amiable Dr. CLARKE.

<P>NOW it will appear, that all the three Definitions of Virtue, which Lord SHAFTES|BURY, Dr. CLARKE, and Mr. WOLLASTON have given us, in de&s;igned Oppo&s;ition to

<P>LET us fir&s;t examine the noble Writer's Definition in this View.

<P>NOW it will doubtle&s;s appear a Circum|&s;tance of Singularity, that Mr. WOLLAS|TON, who &s;aw the e&s;&s;ential Defects of the&s;e two Definitions, &s;hould him&s;elf offer a <HI>third,</HI> which is preci&s;ely liable to the &s;ame Ob|jection. <Q REND="inline">"Virtue, &s;aith this learned Wri|ter, con&s;i&s;ts in a Conformity of our Actions with Truth; in treating every

<P>THE &s;ame Exception mu&s;t be admitted on Dr. CLARKE's Sy&s;tem of Expre&s;&s;ion.

POSSIBLY therefore, the Patrons of the&s;e &s;everal Theories may alledge, that Actions which relate to <HI>inanimate Beings</HI> only, can properly be called no more than <HI>naturally</HI> beautiful, fit, or true: But that <HI>moral</HI> Fit|ne&s;s, Beauty, or Truth, can only ari&s;e from &s;uch Actions as relate to Beings that are <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> or <HI>intelligent.</HI> Mr. BALGUY ex|pre&s;ly makes this Exception: He affirms, that <Q REND="inline">"moral Actions are &s;uch as are know|ingly directed towards &s;ome Object intel|ligent or &s;en&s;ible<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Fir&s;t Treat. on Moral Goodne&s;s,</HI> p. 28.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>AND &s;o far indeed this Refinement ap|proaches towards the Truth, as it excludes all <HI>inanimate</HI> Things from being the Ob|jects of moral Good and Evil. Yet even this Idea of moral Beauty, Fitne&s;s, or Truth, is highly indeterminate and defective: Be|cau&s;e innumerable In&s;tances may be given, of Actions directed towards Objects &s;en&s;ible and intelligent, &s;ome of which Actions are manife&s;tly <HI>becoming, fit,</HI> or <HI>true,</HI> others as manife&s;tly <HI>incongruous, irrational,</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> yet none of them, in any Degree, <HI>virtuous</HI> or <HI>vicious, meritorious</HI> or <HI>immoral.</HI> Thus to &s;peak to a Man in a Language he under|&s;tands, is an Action <HI>becoming, fit,</HI> or <HI>true;</HI>

'tis treating him according to the Order, Relations, and Truth of Things; 'tis treat|ing him according to <HI>what he is.</HI> On the contrary, to &s;peak to him in a Language he under&s;tands not, is an Action neither <HI>be|coming, fit,</HI> nor <HI>true;</HI> 'tis treating him ac|cording to <HI>what he is not;</HI> 'tis treating him <HI>as a Po&s;t.</HI> But although the fir&s;t of the&s;e Actions be undeniably becoming, fit, or true, who will call it <HI>Virtue?</HI> And though the latter be undeniably incongruous, irra|tional, and fal&s;e, who will call it <HI>Vice?</HI> Yet both the&s;e Actions are directed towards a Being that is &s;en&s;ible and intelligent. It follows therefore, that an Action is not either morally Good or Evil, merely becau&s;e it is conformable to the Beauty, Fitne&s;s, or Truth of Things, even though it be di|rected towards an Object both <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> and <HI>intelligent;</HI> but that &s;omething &s;till further, &s;ome more di&s;tingui&s;hing and characteri&s;tic Circum&s;tance is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to fix its real E&s;&s;ence.</P>

<P>SHOULD any one a&s;k, whether <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> are two different Things, no Doubt we &s;hould an&s;wer in the Affirmative: And would &s;urely &s;u&s;pect any Man's Sincerity, who &s;hould tell us, that what was accounted Health in one Age or Nation, was ac|counted Sickne&s;s in another. There are likewi&s;e &s;uch Things as whole&s;ome Food and Poi&s;ons: Nor would we entertain a much better Opinion of him who &s;hould affirm, that <HI>all</HI> depends upon <HI>Fancy;</HI> that <HI>Bread</HI> or <HI>Milk</HI> are nouri&s;hing or de&s;tructive,

<P>NOW, the Ca&s;e we are debating is exact|ly parallel.

All Ages and Nations having without Exception or Variance maintained, that Humanity, Fidelity, Truth, Tem|perance, and mutual Benevolence, do as na|turally produce Happine&s;s, as Food gives Health to the Body: That Cruelty, Trea|chery, Lying, Intemperance, Inhumanity, Adultery, Murder, do as naturally give Ri&s;e to Mi&s;ery, as Poi&s;on brings on Sickne&s;s and Death.</P>
<P>BUT hath not this Author given &s;uch In&s;tances as prove, that what is dete&s;ted as <HI>Vice</HI> in one Country, is applauded as <HI>Virtue</HI> in another? That <HI>Polygamy</HI> and <HI>ince&s;tuous Marriages</HI> have been in &s;ome Nations re|puted <HI>lawful,</HI> in others <HI>meritorious?</HI> And if one Virtue or Vice be imaginary or <HI>variable,</HI> doth it not clearly follow that <HI>all</HI> are &s;o?</P>

<P>BUT this idle Objection again&s;t the per|manent <HI>Reality</HI> of Virtue and Vice, is not the only one which the Writer la&s;t men|tioned hath laboured, for the De&s;truction of Religion and Virtue. For the main Drift and Intention of his Book is to prove no le&s;s a Paradox than this, that <Q REND="inline">"private Vices are public Benefits."</Q> Now, till this Ob|jection be removed, our Idea and Definition of Virtue can never be thoroughly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. For if <HI>private Vices</HI> be <HI>public Be|nefits,</HI> then private <HI>Virtues</HI> are public <HI>Mi&s;|chiefs.</HI> And if &s;o, what becomes of our <HI>Definition?</HI></P>
<P>NOW, the fir&s;t notable Circum&s;tance in this formidable A&s;&s;ertion of Dr. MANDE|VILLE, is its utter Incon&s;i&s;tency with all that he hath advanced in order to de&s;troy the Reality of Vice and Virtue. For if indeed
<PB N="147" REF="156">
the&s;e be mere <HI>Names,</HI> the Creatures of Fancy and Opinion, how can they be at|tended with any <HI>uniform</HI> Effects? How can they be either public <HI>Benefits,</HI> or public <HI>Evils?</HI>&mdash;If on the contrary, they really produce certain uniform Effects, as he hath attempted to prove, how can they be mere <HI>Non-Entities,</HI> the Creatures of Fancy and Opinion? Here lies a gro&s;s and palpable Incoherence: Take which of his two Theories you plea&s;e, the other ab&s;olutely de&s;troys it. If Vice be a public <HI>Benefit,</HI> it mu&s;t be a permanent <HI>Reality:</HI> If it is not a permanent <HI>Reality,</HI> it cannot be a public <HI>Benefit.</HI></P>
<P>LET us now examine the Foundations on which he hath built this &s;trange Hypo|the&s;is. His Book may be analy&s;ed into four different Principles, which he hath variou&s;ly combined, or rather jumbled together, ac|cording as each in their Turn would be&s;t &s;erve his Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Principle he lays down, or ra|ther takes up, <HI>i. e.</HI> for granted, is, <Q REND="inline">"that Man is a compound of evil Pa&s;&s;ions:"</Q> In other Words, <Q REND="inline">"that the Grati&s;ication of the natural Appetites is in it&s;elf a Vice."</Q> There are in his Book, at lea&s;t a hundred
<PB N="148" REF="157">
Pages of the lowe&s;t common-place Decla|mation, all founded on this one Principle, brought from the <HI>&s;olitary Caves</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;ions</HI> of the <HI>De&s;art.</HI> Thus the De&s;ire of being e&s;teemed by others, he &s;tigmatizes with the Name of <HI>Pride:</HI> The natural De&s;ire of &s;o|cial Conver&s;e between the two Sexes, he di&s;tingui&s;heth by a <HI>gro&s;&s;er</HI> Appellation. In a word, through the whole Cour&s;e of his Argument, he <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> that every <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Ap|petite (that is, every Appetite which hath regard to <HI>our&s;elf</HI>) is in its own Nature vile and abominable. This the candid Reader will probably think a little hard upon hu|man Nature: That no Man can be <HI>virtu|ous,</HI> while he endeavours to be <HI>e&s;teemed,</HI> while he loves to quench his Thir&s;t, mi|ni&s;ter to Po&s;terity, or eat his Dinner. On the Weight of the&s;e plain In&s;tances, the Value of this fir&s;t Principle may be &s;afely left to any Man's impartial Trial.</P>
<P>HAVING thus branded every Gratifi|cation of the natural Appetites; he gains from hence a proper Foundation for the &s;econd <HI>Pillar</HI> of this <HI>Temple</HI> of Vice. For he acquaints us with great Solemnity, that, of all other Vices, that of <HI>Luxury</HI> is mo&s;t beneficial to a State: And that if this were
<PB N="149" REF="158">
bani&s;hed the Nation, all Kinds of manual Occupations would immediately langui&s;h and decay<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Fable of the Bees,</HI> pa&s;&s;im.</BIBL></NOTE>. He &s;ays indeed, that <HI>Pedants</HI> make Objections to this Vice of Luxury, and tell you, that it <HI>enervates</HI> a People: But he adds, that <Q REND="inline">"&s;ince he has &s;een the World, the Con&s;equences of Luxury to a Nation, &s;eem not &s;o dreadful to him as they did<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid. p. 247.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Had he left the Matter here, we &s;hould have been at a Lo&s;s to know how he would have made out this &s;trange Tale: But the Riddle is cleared up at once, when we hear him &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline">"every thing is Luxury, that is not immediately nece&s;&s;ary to make Man &s;ub&s;i&s;t as he is a living Creature<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ibid. p. 108.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>WE &s;hould have been &s;tartled perhaps had he a&s;&s;ured us, that he had a <HI>Wind-mill</HI> which laid <HI>Eggs,</HI> and bred <HI>young</HI> ones: But how ea&s;ily had he reconciled us to his Ve|racity by only &s;aying, that by a <HI>Wind-mill</HI> he meant a <HI>Goo&s;e,</HI> or a <HI>Turkey?</HI></P>
<P>THUS, when he affirms that Luxury pro|duceth public Happine&s;s, we &s;tand ready for &s;ome deep and &s;ubtile Speculation, to &s;upport &s;o wondrous a Paradox. But when he poorly tells us, <Q REND="inline">"that every thing is
<PB N="150" REF="159">
Luxury that is not immediately nece&s;&s;ary to make Man &s;ub&s;i&s;t as he is a living Creature;"</Q> we laugh not &s;o much at his Impudence, as at our own Folly in giving Ear to &s;o idle a Prater, who&s;e wide-mouthed Paradoxes &s;o &s;oon dwindle into a little harmle&s;s Non&s;en&s;e; and when we thought we had him reforming States, and new-modeling Philo&s;ophy, he was all the while playing at <HI>Crambo.</HI></P>
<P>LEST it &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected, that the Features of this Man's Folly are here ag|gravated, take a Copy of his Countenance in one In&s;tance out of many that might be given. <Q REND="inline">"The Con&s;equences, &s;aith he, of this Vice of Luxury to a Nation, &s;eem not &s;o dreadful to me as they did"</Q>&mdash;For <Q REND="inline">"clean Linen weakens a Man no more than Flannel<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Fable of the Bees,</HI> p. 119.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> Now from the&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ages laid together, it appears; fir&s;t, that Luxury is a Vice; &s;econdly, that to wear clean Linen is Luxury; and, therefore, it comes out as clear as the Day, <Q REND="inline">"that <HI>to wear clean Linen</HI> is a Vice."</Q></P>

will convince us, that this is impo&s;&s;ible. Becau&s;e all the real Vices he mentions, though they be accidentally productive of &s;ome Good; yet 'tis &s;uch as might effectu|ally be obtained without them. Thus the Money taken wrongfully by Stealth or Rob|bery, is only of Service to the Public by its Circulation: But Money may circulate with|out Stealth or Robbery; and therefore 'tis neither the Stealth nor Robbery that is of Service to the Public. On the other part, there are great and &s;ub&s;tantial Evils, which the&s;e Crimes, and the&s;e alone give Ri&s;e to.

And how, think you, does this Scene of dome&s;tic Horror change its ori|ginal Nature, and ri&s;e at length into a pub|lic Ble&s;&s;ing? Why, becau&s;e the Adven|turers, having made off with their Booty, may po&s;&s;ibly <Q REND="inline">"lay it out upon a <HI>Harlot,</HI> or &s;quander it in a <HI>Night-cellar,</HI> or a <HI>Gin|&s;hop</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Fable of the Bees,</HI> p. 84, 85.</BIBL></NOTE>:"</Q> And thus the Money circulates through the Nation.

<P>HIS fourth Principle is much le&s;s plau&s;i|ble.

In one Sen&s;e a <HI>Motive</HI> is called <HI>di&s;in|tere&s;ted;</HI> when it con&s;i&s;ts in a pure <HI>benevo|lent</HI> Affection, or a Regard to the <HI>moral Sen&s;e.</HI> In another, no Motive is <HI>di&s;in|tere&s;ted:</HI> For even in acting according to the&s;e Impul&s;es of Benevolence and Con|&s;cience, we gratify an Inclination, and act upon the Principle or <HI>immediate Feeling</HI> of <HI>private Happine&s;s.</HI> Thus when we &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"We love Virtue for Virtue's Sake;"</Q> 'tis only implied, that we find immediate Happine&s;s from the Love and Practice of Virtue, with|out Regard to external or future Con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Source of mutual Mi&s;appre|hen&s;ion on this Subject hath been <Q REND="inline">"the In|troduction

It tends to mi&s;lead us both with regard to the Nature of Vir|tue, and our Obligations to the Practice of it. For fir&s;t, it induceth a Per&s;ua&s;ion, that Virtue is <HI>excellent</HI> without Regard to any of
<PB N="163" REF="172">
its Con&s;equences: And &s;econdly, that he mu&s;t either want Eyes, or common Di&s;cern|ment, who doth not at fir&s;t Sight fall in Love with this <HI>matchle&s;s Lady.</HI></P>
<P>THEREFORE &s;etting a&s;ide, as much as may be, all ambiguous Expre&s;&s;ions, it &s;eems evident, that <Q REND="inline">"a Motive, from its very Na|ture, mu&s;t be &s;omething that affects <HI>our|&s;elf.</HI>"</Q> If any Man hath found out a Kind of Motive which doth not affect <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> he hath made a deeper Inve&s;tigation into the <Q REND="inline">"Springs, Weights, and Balances"</Q> of the human Heart, than I can pretend to.

<P>BUT to come to the direct Proof: 'Tis evident, even to Demon&s;tration, that no <HI>Affection</HI> can, in the &s;trict Sen&s;e, be more or le&s;s <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> or <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> than another; becau&s;e, <HI>whatever</HI> be its <HI>Object,</HI> the <HI>Af|fection</HI> it&s;elf is <HI>&s;till</HI> no other than a <HI>Mode</HI> either of <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> or of <HI>Pain;</HI> and is there|fore <HI>equally</HI> to be referred to the <HI>Mind</HI> or <HI>Feeling</HI> of the <HI>Patient,</HI> whatever be its <HI>ex|ternal Occa&s;ion.</HI> Indeed, a late Writer of Subtilty and Refinement hath attempted to

make a Di&s;tinction here. He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"It hath been ob&s;erved, that every Act of Virtue or Friend&s;hip is attended with a &s;ecret <HI>Plea&s;ure;</HI> from whence it hath been concluded, that Friend&s;hip and Vir|tue could not be di&s;intere&s;ted.

<P>NOW this Conclu&s;ion will carry us to another Que&s;tion of a very intere&s;ting and ab&s;tru&s;e Nature: That is, <Q REND="inline">"How far, and upon what Foundation, the uniform Practice of Virtue, is <HI>really</HI> and <HI>clearly</HI> connected with the Happine&s;s of every Individual?"</Q> For &s;o far, as we have &s;een, and no further, can every Individual be na|turally moved or obliged to the Practice of it.</P>
<P>THIS is evidently a Que&s;tion of <HI>Fact:</HI> And as it relates to the <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> of <HI>Man,</HI> can only be determined by appealing to his <HI>Con&s;titution.</HI> If <HI>this</HI> be indeed <HI>uniform</HI> and <HI>invariable;</HI> that is, if every Individual hath the &s;ame Perceptions, Pa&s;&s;ions, and De&s;ires; then indeed the Sources of Happine&s;s mu&s;t be <HI>&s;imilar</HI> and <HI>unchangeable.</HI> If, on the con|trary, different Men be differently con&s;ti|tuted; if they have <HI>different</HI> Perceptions, Pa&s;&s;ions, and De&s;ires; then mu&s;t the Sources of their Happine&s;s be equally <HI>va|rious.</HI></P>
<P>IT &s;hould &s;eem therefore, that <Q REND="inline">"while Morali&s;ts have been enquiring into hu|man Happine&s;s, they have generally con|&s;idered
<PB N="169" REF="178">
it, as ari&s;ing from one <HI>uniform</HI> and <HI>particular</HI> Source, in&s;tead of tracing it up to tho&s;e various Fountains whence it really &s;prings; which are indefinitely various, combined, and indeterminable."</Q> And this &s;eems to have been the mo&s;t general Foundation of Error.</P>
<P>IF we &s;peak with Preci&s;ion, there are but three Sources in Man, of Plea&s;ure and Pain, Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery: The&s;e are <HI>Sen&s;e, Imagination,</HI> and the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> Now the &s;lighte&s;t Ob&s;ervation will convince us, that the&s;e are a&s;&s;ociated, &s;eparated and combined in Man, with a Variety almo&s;t infinite. In &s;ome, the Plea&s;ures and Pains of <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> pre|dominate; Imagination is dull; the Pa&s;&s;ions inactive. In others, a more delicate Frame awakens all the Powers of Imagination; the Pa&s;&s;ions are refined; the Sen&s;es di&s;|regarded. A third Con&s;titution is carried away by the Strength of Pa&s;&s;ion: The Calls of Sen&s;e are contemned; and Imagination becomes no more than the nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tru|ment of &s;ome further Gratification.</P>
<P>From overlooking this plain Fact, &s;eems to have ari&s;en the Di&s;cordance among Phi|lo&s;ophers concerning the Happine&s;s of Man. And while <HI>each</HI> hath attempted to exhibit

<P>THUS, mo&s;t of the <HI>Epicurean</HI> Sect, tho' not the Founder of it, have di&s;carded <HI>Be|nevolence</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> from their Sy&s;tem of <HI>private</HI> Happine&s;s. The modern Patro|nizers of this Scheme, Mr. HOBBES, Dr. MANDEVILLE, and &s;everal <HI>French</HI> Writers, after heaping up a Collection of &s;ordid In|&s;tances, which prove the <HI>&s;en&s;ual</HI> Inclinations and <HI>Selfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> of Man, leap at once to their de&s;ired Conclu&s;ion, that the pretended pub|lic Affections are therefore no more than the &s;ame low Pa&s;&s;ions in Di&s;gui&s;e. That <HI>Benevolence</HI> makes no Part of Man's Na|ture; that the human Kind are ab&s;olutely unconnected with each other in Point of Affection: And that every Individual <HI>&s;eeks</HI> and <HI>finds</HI> his <HI>private</HI> Happine&s;s in and <HI>from him&s;elf alone.</HI></P>
<P>THE noble Writer, on the contrary, viewing the brighter Parts of human Na|ture, through the amiable Medium of the <HI>Socratic</HI> Philo&s;ophy; and fixing his Atten|tion on the <HI>public Affections,</HI> as the In&s;tru|ments both of public and private Happi|ne&s;s;
<PB N="171" REF="180">
rejects the <HI>Epicurean's</HI> Pretences with Di&s;dain: And fully con&s;cious of the high Claims and Energy of Virtue, affirms that the <HI>private Affections</HI> are, by no means, a Foundation for <HI>private Happine&s;s:</HI> That, on the contrary, we mu&s;t univer&s;ally pro|mote the Welfare of others, if we would effectually &s;ecure our own: And that in every Ca&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Virtue</HI> is the <HI>Good,</HI> and <HI>Vice</HI> the <HI>Ill</HI> of every one<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Enquiry concerning Virtue,</HI> pa&s;&s;im.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>'TIS plain, no two Sy&s;tems of Philo&s;ophy can be more <HI>di&s;cordant</HI> than the&s;e; yet each of them have obtained a Number of Parti|zans in all Ages of the World.

<P>THIS &s;eems to have ari&s;en, not from a <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> but a <HI>partial</HI> View and Examination of the Subject.

Both</HI> forgetting,
<PB N="172" REF="181">
what is unque&s;tionably the Truth, that the&s;e <HI>&s;ocial</HI> and <HI>private</HI> Affections are blend|ed in an endle&s;s Variety of Degrees, and thus form an infinite Variety of Inclinations and of Characters.

Thus, 'tis true, that Mankind reap high Enjoy|ments from the Sen&s;es, Imagination, and Pa&s;&s;ions, without any regard to the public Affections: But the Con&s;equence which the <HI>Epicurean</HI> would draw from hence, that <Q REND="inline">"therefore the public Affections are never, in any Ca&s;e, a Source of private Happi|ne&s;s;"</Q> this is entirely void of Evidence: It &s;uppo&s;eth Mankind to be <HI>one uniform</HI> Subject, while it is a Subject infinitely <HI>va|rious;</HI> that every Individual has the &s;ame Feelings, Appetites, Fancies, and Affections, while, in Fact, they are mixed and com|bined in an endle&s;s Variety of Degrees.

<P>LET us now a&s;&s;ign the mo&s;t probable Foundation, on which the&s;e <HI>narrow</HI> and <HI>partial</HI> Sy&s;tems have been &s;o commonly embraced.

THE next remarkable Peculiarity is, <Q REND="inline">"where not the Sen&s;es, but <HI>Imagination</HI> is the predominant Source of Plea&s;ure."</Q> Here the Ta&s;te always runs into the elegant Refinements of polite Arts and Acquire|ments; of Painting, Mu&s;ic, Architecture, Poetry, Sculpture: Or, in Defect of this truer Ta&s;te, on the fal&s;e Delicacies of Dre&s;s, Furniture, and Equipage.

no immediate or nece&s;&s;ary Connexion with the Happine&s;s of Mankind, which is often and <HI>de&s;ignedly</HI> violated in order to gain the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. 'Tis true, the Plea&s;ures of Imagination and Virtue are often <HI>united</HI> in the &s;ame Mind; but 'tis equally true, that they are often <HI>&s;eparate;</HI> that they who are mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible to the <HI>one,</HI> are entire Strangers to the <HI>other;</HI> that one Man, to <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> a fine <HI>Picture,</HI> will <HI>oppre&s;s</HI> his Tenant; that another, to <HI>relieve</HI> his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Tenant, will <HI>&s;ell</HI> his Statues or his Pictures. The Rea&s;on is evident: The one draws his Plea|&s;ure from <HI>Imagination;</HI> the other from <HI>Af|fection</HI> only. 'Tis clear therefore, that <Q REND="inline">"where <HI>Imagination</HI> is naturally the pre|dominant Source of Plea&s;ure,"</Q> the Mo|tives to Virtue mu&s;t be very <HI>partial</HI> and <HI>weak,</HI> &s;ince the chief Happine&s;s ari&s;eth from a Source entirely di&s;tinct from the <HI>benevolent Affections.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER, and very different Tempera|ture of the Heart of Man is that <Q REND="inline">"wherein neither Sen&s;e nor Imagination, but the PASSIONS are the chief Sources of Plea|&s;ure and Pain."</Q> This often forms the <HI>be&s;t</HI> or the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> of Characters.

Jealou&s;y, Pride, Hatred, Envy, and Revenge; or, 2<HI>dly,</HI> Into the amiable Af|fections of Hope, Faith, Candour, Pity, Genero&s;ity, and Good-will; or, 3<HI>dly,</HI> Into a various Mixture or Combination of the&s;e; which is undoubtedly the mo&s;t common Temperature of human Kind.</P>
<P>NOW to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Tempers, how can we affirm with Truth, that there is a natural Motive or Obligation to Virtue?

The noble Writer indeed, in his Zeal for Virtue, con&s;iders the&s;e black Pa&s;&s;ions as <HI>un|natural,</HI> and brands them as a Source of <HI>con&s;tant Mi&s;ery</HI><NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Enquiry.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. And &s;ure it would be matter of Joy to all good Men, to find his Proofs convincing.

'Tis not the Part of a Philo&s;opher to write <HI>Pane|gyrics,</HI> but to <HI>inve&s;tigate</HI> the real State of human Nature; and the only Way of doing
<PB N="182" REF="193">
this to any good Purpo&s;e, is to do it <HI>impar|tially:</HI> For with regard to human Nature, as well as Individuals, <Q REND="inline">"Flattery is a Crime no le&s;s than Slander."</Q></P>
<P>WHEN therefore the noble Writer calls the&s;e Affections <HI>unnatural,</HI> he doth not &s;uf|ficiently explain him&s;elf. If indeed by their being unnatural, he means, that <Q REND="inline">"they are &s;uch in their Degrees or Objects as to violate the public Happine&s;s, which is the main Intention of Nature;"</Q> in this Sen&s;e, 'tis acknowledged, they are <HI>unnatural.</HI> But this Interpretation is foreign to the Que|&s;tion; becau&s;e it affects not the <HI>Individual.</HI> But if, by their being <HI>unnatural,</HI> he would imply, that they are <Q REND="inline">"a Source of con&s;tant Mi&s;ery to the Agent;"</Q> this &s;eems a Pro|po&s;ition not ea&s;y to be determined in the Affirmative.</P>
<P>FOR the main Proof which he brings in Support of this A&s;&s;ertion is, <Q REND="inline">"that the Men of <HI>gentle&s;t Di&s;po&s;itions,</HI> and <HI>be&s;t of Tempers,</HI> have at &s;ome time or other been &s;ufficiently acquainted with tho&s;e Di&s;tur|bances, which, at ill Hours, even &s;mall Occa&s;ions are apt to rai&s;e.

the ill Moments which are pa&s;&s;ed, when the Temper is ever &s;o little galled and fretted.

<P>NOW, this In&s;tance is by no means &s;uf|ficient to &s;upport the Affirmation.

<P>ON the contrary, where the amiable Af|fections of Hope, Candour, Genero&s;ity, and
<PB N="185" REF="196">
Benevolence predominate, in this be&s;t and happie&s;t of Tempers, Virtue hath indeed all the Force and Energy, which the noble Writer attributes to her Charms.

<P>NOW, among all this infinite Variety of Tempers which is found in Nature, we &s;ee there cannot be any uniform Motive or Ob|ligation to Virtue, &s;ave only <Q REND="inline">"where the Sen&s;es are weak, the Imagination refined, and the public Affections &s;trongly predo|minant."</Q> For in every other Character, where either the Sen&s;es, gro&s;s Imagination, or &s;elfi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions prevail, a natural Oppo|&s;ition or Di&s;cordance mu&s;t ari&s;e, and de&s;troy the uniform Motive to Virtue, by throwing the Happine&s;s of the Agent into a different Channel.

<P>FROM the&s;e different Views of hu|man Nature, let us now bring this Argu|ment to a Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE noble Writer's Scheme of Morals therefore, being grounded on a Suppo&s;ition, which runs through the whole Cour&s;e of his Argument, that <Q REND="inline">"all Mankind are na|turally capable of attaining a <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> or <HI>Re|li&s;h</HI> for <HI>Virtue,</HI> &s;ufficient for every Pur|po&s;e of &s;ocial Life,"</Q> &s;eems e&s;&s;entially de|fective. For, from the Enquiry already made into the real and various Con&s;titution
<PB N="188" REF="199">
of Man, it appears, that a great Part of the Species are naturally incapable of this <HI>fan|cied</HI> Excellence. That the various Mix|ture and Predominancy of <HI>Sen&s;e, Imagi|nation,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> give a different Ca&s;t and Complexion of Mind to every Individual: That the <HI>Feeling</HI> or <HI>Pro&s;pect</HI> of Happine&s;s can only ari&s;e from this Combination: That con&s;equently, where the benevolent Af|fections and moral Sen&s;e are weak, the &s;elfi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions and Perceptions head&s;trong, there can be no internal Motive or natural Obligation to the <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> Practice of Vir|tue.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t plau&s;ible Pretence I could ever meet with, amid&s;t all the Pomp of Decla|mation thrown out in Support of this <HI>All-Sufficiency</HI> of a <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> in Morals, is this. <Q REND="inline">"That although the Force and Energy of this Ta&s;te for Virtue appears not in every Individual, yet the Power lies dormant in every human Brea&s;t; and needs only be called forth by a <HI>voluntary Self-Di&s;cipline,</HI> in order to be brought to its ju&s;t Per|fection.

<P>THE noble Writer hath innumerable Pa&s;&s;ages of this Kind: So many indeed, that it were Labour lo&s;t to tran&s;cribe them<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Charact.</HI> pa&s;&s;im.</BIBL></NOTE>.

<P>NOW this State of the Ca&s;e, though at fir&s;t View it carries &s;ome Degree of Plau&s;i|bility, yet, on a clo&s;er Examination, de&s;troys the whole Sy&s;tem.

to make the Poet an Architect, or the Painter a Mu&s;ician, you may make a pre|tending <HI>Pedant,</HI> never an accompli&s;hed <HI>Ma&s;ter.</HI> 'Tis the &s;ame in Morals: Where the benevolent Affections are naturally &s;trong, <HI>there</HI> is a <HI>Capacity</HI> for a high <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> in Virtue: Where the&s;e are <HI>weak</HI> or <HI>wanting,</HI> there is in the &s;ame Proportion, <HI>little</HI> or <HI>no Capacity</HI> for a <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> in Virtue. To harangue, therefore, on the &s;uperior Happine&s;s attend|ing the Exerci&s;e of the public Affections, is quite foreign to the Purpo&s;e.

<P>THUS, as according to the&s;e Morali&s;ts, the <HI>Reli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> for Virtue is &s;imilar to a Ta&s;te for Arts; &s;o what is &s;aid of the Poet, the Painter, and Mu&s;ician, may with equal Truth be &s;aid of the Man of Virtue&mdash;<HI>Na&s;citur, non fit.</HI> Hence it is evident, that the noble Writer's Sy&s;tem, which &s;uppo&s;eth all Men capable of this exalted Ta&s;te, is chimerical and groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT even &s;uppo&s;ing all Men capable of this refined Ta&s;te in Morals, there would ari&s;e an unan&s;werable Objection again&s;t the Efficacy of this refined Theory. Though it were allowed, that all Mankind have the &s;ame delicate Perception of <HI>moral,</HI> as &s;ome few have of <HI>natural</HI> Beauty, yet the Parallel would by no means hold, that <Q REND="inline">"as the <HI>Vir|tuo&s;o</HI> always pur&s;ues his Ta&s;te in Arts <HI>con&s;i&s;tently,</HI> &s;o the Man of <HI>Virtue</HI> mu&s;t be equally <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> in <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>Beha|viour.</HI>"</Q> For the <HI>Virtuo&s;o</HI> being only en|gaged in mere <HI>Speculation,</HI> hath no oppo|&s;ite Affections to counteract his Ta&s;te: He

meets with no Ob&s;tructions in his Admira|tion of Beauty: His Enthu&s;ia&s;m takes its unbounded Flight, not retarded by any Im|pediments of a di&s;cordant Nature.

Hence even &s;uppo&s;ing the mo&s;t refined Ta&s;te for Virtue common to all, it mu&s;t ever be retarded in its Progre&s;s, often baffled and overthrown amid&s;t the <HI>Struggle</HI> of contending <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>THIS &s;eems to be a full and &s;ufficient Reply to all that can be urged in Support of this fanta&s;tic Sy&s;tem from a View of <HI>human Nature.</HI> But as the noble Writer hath at|tempted to confirm his Theory by &s;ome collateral Arguments of another Kind, it may be proper here to con&s;ider their real Weight.</P>
<P>HE urges, therefore, the Probability at lea&s;t, if not the certain Truth of his Hypo|the&s;is from hence, <Q REND="inline">"That it would be an

Imputation on the Wi&s;dom of the Deity to &s;uppo&s;e that he had formed Man &s;o imperfect, that the true Happine&s;s of the Individual &s;hould not always coincide with that of the whole Kind<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Enquiry.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> And beyond Que&s;tion, the A&s;&s;ertion is true: But the Con&s;equence he draws from it, <Q REND="inline">"that therefore human Happine&s;s mu&s;t always con&s;i&s;t in the immediate Feeling of virtu|ous Enjoyment,"</Q> is utterly groundle&s;s. This Inference &s;eems to have been drawn from a View of the <HI>Brute</HI> Creation; in which, we find, <HI>In&s;tincts</HI> or <HI>immediate Feel|ings</HI> are the only Motives to Action; and in which, we find too, that the&s;e immediate Propen&s;ities are <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> for all the Pur|po&s;es of their Being. In this Con&s;titution of Things the Creator's Wi&s;dom is emi|nently di&s;played; becau&s;e, through a Defect of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>Reflexion,</HI> no other kind of Principle could po&s;&s;ibly have taken Place. But the Conclu&s;ion drawn from thence, <Q REND="inline">"that Man mu&s;t have a &s;imilar Strength of In&s;tinct implanted in him, in order to di|rect him to his &s;upreme Happine&s;s,"</Q> this is without Foundation: Becau&s;e the Deity hath given him not only <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Per|ceptions,

but <HI>Rea&s;on, Reflexion,</HI> and a <HI>Fore|&s;ight</HI> of <HI>future</HI> Good and Evil, together with a &s;ufficient Power to obtain the one, and avoid the other. As therefore Man hath &s;ufficient Notices of the <HI>moral Government</HI> of GOD, which will at length produce a perfect Coincidence between the <HI>virtuous</HI> Conduct and the <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> of every Indivi|dual, it implies no e&s;&s;ential Defect of Wi&s;|dom in the Creator, to &s;uppo&s;e that he hath not given this <HI>univer&s;al</HI> and <HI>unerring</HI> Bia&s;s towards Virtue to the whole human Species.

<P>AGAIN, the noble Writer often attempts to &s;trengthen his Argument, by <Q REND="inline">"repre&s;ent|ing the <HI>external Good</HI> which naturally <HI>flows</HI> from <HI>Virtue,</HI> and the <HI>external</HI> Evils which naturally <HI>attend</HI> on Vice<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Enquiry,</HI> B. ii.

<PB N="197" REF="208">

<P>HOWEVER, that nothing may be omitted which can even remotely affect the Truth; we may ob&s;erve, in pa&s;&s;ing, that after all the laboured and <HI>well-meant</HI> Declamation on this Subject, 'tis much ea&s;ier to prove, <Q REND="inline">"that <HI>Vice</HI> is the Parent of <HI>external</HI> Mi&s;ery, than that <HI>Virtue</HI> is the Parent of <HI>external</HI> Hap|pine&s;s."</Q> 'Tis plain, that no Man can be vici|ous in any con&s;iderable <HI>Degree,</HI> but he mu&s;t &s;uffer either in his <HI>Health,</HI> his <HI>Fame,</HI> or <HI>For|tune.</HI> Now the Generality of Morali&s;ts, after proving or illu&s;trating this, have taken it for granted, as a certain Con&s;equence, that the external Goods of Life are, by the Law of Contraries, in a &s;imilar Manner annexed to the Practice of Virtue. But in Reality the Proof can reach no further than to &s;hew
<PB N="198" REF="209">
the happy Con&s;equences of <HI>Innocence,</HI> which is a very different Thing from <HI>Virtue;</HI> for <HI>Innocence</HI> is only the <HI>ab&s;taining</HI> from <HI>Evil; Virtue,</HI> the actual Production of <HI>Good.</HI> Now 'tis evident indeed, that by <HI>ab&s;taining</HI> from <HI>Evil</HI> (that is, by <HI>Innocence</HI>) we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;tand clear of the Mi&s;eries to which we expo&s;e our&s;elves by the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> of it: And this is as far as the Argument will go.

<P>BUT whenever Appearances grow too &s;trong again&s;t the noble Writer's Sy&s;tem, he takes Refuge in an&mdash;<HI>apage Vulgus!</HI>&mdash;As he had before allowed, that <Q REND="inline">"the Vul|gar may &s;wallow any &s;ordid Je&s;t or Buf|foonry,"</Q> &s;o here he frequently &s;ugge&s;ts, that among the &s;ame Ranks, <Q REND="inline">"any kind of &s;ordid Plea&s;ure will go down."</Q> But <Q REND="inline">"as it mu&s;t be a finer Kind of Wit that takes with the Men of Breeding,"</Q> &s;o in Morals <Q REND="inline">"the <HI>Reli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Ta&s;le</HI> for Virtue, is what na|turally prevails in the higher Stages of Life: That the <HI>liberal</HI> and <HI>poli&s;hed</HI> Part of Mankind are di&s;po&s;ed to treat every other Principle of Action as groundle&s;s and <HI>ima|ginary:</HI> But that among the&s;e, the <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> in Morals, if properly cultivated, mu&s;t needs be &s;ufficient for all the Purpo&s;es of Virtue<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Mi&s;c. 3^d. c. 2. and many other detached Pa&s;|&s;ages.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>IN reply to this, which is perhaps the weake&s;t Pretence of all that the noble Wri|ter hath alledged, we need only ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e who are born to <HI>Honours, Power,</HI> and <HI>Fortune,</HI> come into the World with the
<PB N="200" REF="211">
&s;ame <HI>various</HI> Mixture and <HI>Predominancy</HI> of <HI>Sen&s;e, Imagination,</HI> and <HI>Affections,</HI> with the <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> Ranks of Mankind. So that if they really enjoy better Opportunities of being compleatly virtuous, the&s;e mu&s;t ari&s;e not from their internal <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> but their external <HI>Situation</HI> in Life. Let us examine how far this may give a Bia&s;s either towards Vice or Virtue.</P>
<P>NOW 'tis plain that, with regard to the <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> or bodily <HI>Appetites,</HI> the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Power and Fortune mu&s;t be rather hurtful than favourable to Virtue. Wealth gives Opportunity of <HI>Indulgence,</HI> and Indulgence naturally <HI>inflames.</HI> Hence the Habits of <HI>&s;en&s;ual</HI> Inclination mu&s;t in general be &s;tronger in the <HI>Lord</HI> than the <HI>Pea&s;ant:</HI> Therefore, as nothing tends &s;o much to imbrute the Man, and &s;ink every nobler Affection of the Mind, as a &s;ervile Attendance on &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure; &s;o in this Regard, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Power and Fortune is rather <HI>dangerous</HI> than &s;avourable to Virtue.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame may be affirmed in re&s;pect to the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> or <HI>Affections.</HI> Can any thing tend &s;o much to render any Pa&s;&s;ion ungo|vernable, as to know that we <HI>need not</HI> go|vern it? That our Power, Riches, and Au|thority,
<PB N="201" REF="212">
rai&s;e us <HI>above Controul?</HI> That we can hate, oppre&s;s, revenge, with <HI>Impunity?</HI> Are not the <HI>Great,</HI> of all others, mo&s;t ob|noxious to <HI>Flattery?</HI> Does not this tend to produce and nouri&s;h an <HI>overweening</HI> Opinion of <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> an unju&s;t <HI>Contempt</HI> of <HI>others?</HI> And is not <HI>true Virtue</HI> more likely to be <HI>lo&s;t</HI> than improved, amid&s;t all the&s;e &s;urrounding Temptations?</P>
<P>THE <HI>Imagination</HI> indeed is often refined, and <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> improved, in the higher Ranks of Life, beyond the Reach of the <HI>mere Vul|gar.</HI> But they are little acquainted with human Nature, who think that <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Imagination,</HI> among the Bulk of Mankind, are any thing more than the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the <HI>ruling Appetites</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions:</HI> E&s;pecially where the Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions are in|flamed by the <HI>early</HI> and <HI>habitual</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Honours, Power, and Riches.</P>
<P>BUT &s;till it will be urged, that the <HI>Great</HI> are under the Dominion of a powerful Prin|ciple, which is almo&s;t unknown among the <HI>Vulgar:</HI>&mdash;The Principle of HONOUR&mdash;which is a perfect <HI>Balance</HI> again&s;t all the&s;e &s;urrounding Difficulties, and a full <HI>Security</HI> to <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="213">
WITH regard to this <HI>boa&s;ted</HI> Principle, a very material Di&s;tinction mu&s;t be made. By <HI>Honour,</HI> is &s;ometimes meant <Q REND="inline">"an Af|fection of Mind determining the Agent to the Practice of what is right, without any Dependence on other Men's Opi|nions."</Q> Now this is but the <HI>moral Sen&s;e,</HI> under a new Appellation: It ari&s;eth too, not from any particular <HI>Situation</HI> of Life, but from the natural <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> of the Mind. Accordingly, it is not confined to any one Rank of Men, but is &s;een promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly among the <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Vulgar.</HI> 'Tis therefore entirely beyond the pre&s;ent Que|&s;tion, which only relates to &s;uch Circum|&s;tances as are peculiar to <HI>high Life.</HI></P>
<P>THE other, and more common Accep|tation of the Word <HI>Honour,</HI> and in which alone it belongs peculiarly to the <HI>Great,</HI> is <Q REND="inline">"an Affection of the Mind determining the Agent to &s;uch a Conduct, as may gain him the <HI>Applau&s;e</HI> or <HI>E&s;teem</HI> of tho&s;e who&s;e good Opinion he is fond of."</Q> Now this Love of <HI>Fame,</HI> and Fear of <HI>Di&s;grace,</HI> though, as a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> Motive to Action, it be often of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence in Life; though it often <HI>counterfeits,</HI> &s;ome|times even <HI>rivals</HI> Benevolence it&s;elf; yet as
<PB N="203" REF="214">
a <HI>principal</HI> Motive, there cannot be a more <HI>precarious</HI> Foundation of Virtue. For the <HI>Effects</HI> of this Principle will always depend on the <HI>Opinions</HI> of others: It will always take its particular Complexion from <HI>the&s;e,</HI> and mu&s;t always <HI>vary</HI> with them. Thus 'tis a Matter of mere <HI>Accident,</HI> whether its Con&s;equences be <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad, whole&s;ome</HI> or <HI>pernicious.</HI> If the <HI>applanded Maxims</HI> be founded in <HI>Benevolence,</HI> the Principle will &s;o far lead to <HI>Virtue:</HI> If they be founded in <HI>Pride, Folly,</HI> or <HI>Contempt,</HI> the Principle will lead to <HI>Vice.</HI> And, without any de&s;igned Satire on the <HI>Great,</HI> it mu&s;t be owned, the latter of the&s;e hath ever been the <HI>predomi|nant</HI> Character of <HI>Honour.</HI> It were fal&s;e indeed to affirm, that the Principle hath no Mixture of <HI>benevolent</HI> Intention; yet 'tis equally clear, that its <HI>chief</HI> De&s;ign is not &s;o much to &s;ecure the <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> of <HI>all,</HI> as to maintain the <HI>Superiority</HI> of a <HI>few:</HI> And hence this Principle hath ever led its Vota|ries to abhor the Commi&s;&s;ion, not &s;o much of what is <HI>unju&s;t,</HI> as of what is <HI>contemptible.</HI> Thus it is clear, that the Principle of <HI>Ho|nour,</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>benevolent</HI> Af|fection and the <HI>moral Sen&s;e,</HI> can never be a

<PB N="213" REF="224">
him&s;elf often &s;peaks with the highe&s;t Re|&s;pect of <HI>Legi&s;lators,</HI> of the Founders of <HI>Society</HI> and <HI>Empire,</HI> who, by the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of wi&s;e and whole&s;ome Laws, drew Mankind from their State of natural Bar|barity, to that of cultivated Life and &s;ocial Happine&s;s: Unle&s;s indeed he &s;uppo&s;es that ORPHEUS and the re&s;t of them did their Bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>literally</HI> by <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> and a <HI>Fiddle.</HI> If therefore the ju&s;t Fear of <HI>human</HI> Power might be inforced without in&s;ulting or vio|lating the <HI>Genero&s;ity</HI> of our Nature, whence comes it, that a ju&s;t Fear of the <HI>Creator</HI> &s;hould &s;o mi&s;erably degrade the Species?

<P>FURTHER: If we con&s;ider the religious Principle in its true Light, there is nothing in it either <HI>mean, &s;lavi&s;h,</HI> or <HI>unworthy.</HI> To be in a <HI>Fright</HI> indeed, to live under the Sug|ge&s;tions of <HI>perpetual Terror</HI> (in which, the noble Writer would per&s;uade us, the religi|ous Principle con&s;i&s;ts) is far from an amia|ble Condition.

E&s;&s;ence of the religious Principle or the <HI>Fear</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>AND as to the other Branch of religious Principle, <Q REND="inline">"the Hope and Pro&s;pect of higher Degrees of future Happine&s;s and Perfection:"</Q>&mdash;What is there of <HI>mean, &s;lavi&s;h,</HI> or <HI>unworthy</HI> in it?

<P>THE noble Writer indeed confe&s;&s;eth, that <Q REND="inline">"if by the Hope of Reward, be under&s;tood the Love and De&s;ire (he ought to have &s;aid, the <HI>Hope</HI>) of <HI>virtuous Enjoyment,</HI> it

is not derogatory to Virtue."</Q> But that in every other Sen&s;e, the indulged Hope of Reward is not only mean and mercenary, but even <HI>hurtful</HI> to Virtue and common <HI>Hu|manity:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"For in this religious Sort of Di&s;|cipline, the Principle of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> which is <HI>naturally &s;o prevailing</HI> in us <HI>(indeed?)</HI> being no way moderated or re&s;trained, but rather improved and made &s;tronger every Day, by the Exerci&s;e of the Pa&s;|&s;ions in a Subject of more extended Self-Intere&s;t; there may be rea&s;on to appre|hend le&s;t the Temper of this kind &s;hould extend it&s;elf in general through all the Parts of Life."</Q></P>
<P>THIS, to &s;ay the be&s;t of it, is the very <HI>Phrenzy</HI> of Virtue. Religion propo&s;eth true Happine&s;s as the End and Con&s;equence of virtuous Action: This is granted. It propo&s;eth it by &s;uch Motives as mu&s;t in|fluence Self-Love, and con&s;equently hath given the be&s;t Means of procuring it. Yet, it &s;eems, Self-Love being not re&s;trained, but made &s;tronger, will make Man kind mi&s;s of true Happine&s;s. That is, by leading Self-Love into the Path of <HI>true</HI> Happine&s;s, Religion will inevitably conduct it to <HI>fal&s;e;</HI> by commanding us to <HI>cheri&s;h</HI> our <HI>public</HI> Af|fections,

it will certainly <HI>inflame</HI> the <HI>private</HI> ones; by a&s;&s;uring us, that if we would be happy hereafter, we mu&s;t be <HI>virtuous</HI> and <HI>benevolent,</HI> it will beyond Que&s;tion render us <HI>vile</HI> and <HI>void</HI> of <HI>Benevolence.</HI> But this Mode of Rea&s;oning is common with the noble Writer.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, at other Times his Lord&s;hip can de&s;cend to the Level of common Sen&s;e; and pro&s;ecute his Argument by Proofs dia|metrically oppo&s;ite to what he here ad|vanceth. For in proving the Obligations of Man to Virtue, after having modelled the inward State of the human Mind according to his own Imagination, he proceeds to con|&s;ider the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> which regard <HI>our&s;elves,</HI> and draws another, and indeed a &s;tronger Proof from <HI>the&s;e.</HI>&mdash;He there proves<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Inquiry,</HI> B. ii.

He ob&s;erves that Am|bition is ever <Q REND="inline">"&s;u&s;picious, jealous, captious, and uncapable of bearing the lea&s;t Di&s;|appointment."</Q> He then proceeds thro' a Variety of other Pa&s;&s;ions, proving them all to be the Sources of &s;ome internal or ex|ternal Mi&s;ery. Thus he awakens the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> which, in a reli|gious View, he &s;o bitterly inveighs again&s;t. Thus he exhibits a Picture of future <HI>Re|wards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments,</HI> even of the mo&s;t <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Kind: He recommends the Confor|mity to Virtue, on the Score both of pre|&s;ent and future <HI>Advantage:</HI> He <HI>deters</HI> his Reader from the Commi&s;&s;ion of Vice, by repre&s;enting the Mi&s;ery it will produce. And the&s;e too, &s;uch <HI>Advantages</HI> and &s;uch <HI>Mi&s;eries,</HI> as are entirely di&s;tinct from the mere Feeling of virtuous Affection or its contrary: From the Con&s;iderations of Safe|ty, Alleviation of <HI>bodily</HI> Pain, the Avoid|ance of <HI>Di&s;ta&s;te,</HI> and <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es.</HI> Now doth not his own Cavil here recoil upon him? <Q REND="inline">"That in this Sort of Di&s;cipline, and by exhibiting &s;uch Motives as the&s;e, the Prin|ciple of Self-Love mu&s;t be made &s;tronger, by the Exerci&s;e of the Pa&s;&s;ions in a Sub|ject

For, as we have &s;een, the <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> or <HI>Pro&s;pect</HI> of Happine&s;s, is the only po&s;&s;ible Motive to Action; and if we are taught to believe that <HI>virtuous Affection</HI> will produce <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> whether the expected Happine&s;s lies in <HI>this</HI> Life, or <HI>another,</HI> it will <HI>tend,</HI> and <HI>equally</HI> tend, to produce <HI>virtuous</HI> Affection. The noble Writer, therefore, and his Ad|mirers, might as well attempt to remove Mountains, as to prove that the <HI>Hope</HI> and Pro&s;pect of a happy Immortality, can ju&s;tly be accounted more &s;ervile, mercenary, or <HI>hurtful,</HI> than the View of tho&s;e tran&s;ient and earthly Advantages, which his Lord&s;hip hath &s;o rhetorically and hone&s;tly di&s;play'd, for the Intere&s;t and Security of <HI>Virtue.</HI> In Truth, they are preci&s;ely of the &s;ame Na|ture, and only differ in Time, Duration, and Degree.

it were <HI>ab&s;urd,</HI> as well as <HI>impious,</HI> to attempt to <HI>&s;eparate</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><P>Hence we may &s;ee the Weakne&s;s and Mi&s;take of tho&s;e <HI>ful&s;ely religious,</HI> who fall into an <HI>Extreme</HI> directly <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> to this of the noble Writer; who are <HI>&s;candalized</HI> at our being determined to the Pur&s;uit of Virtue through any Degree of Regard to its happy Con&s;equences in this Life; which Regard they call <HI>worldly, carnal, prophane.</HI> For it is evident, that the religious Motive is preci&s;ely of the &s;ame Kind; only <HI>&s;tronger,</HI> as the Happine&s;s ex|pected is <HI>greater</HI> and more <HI>la&s;ting.</HI> While therefore we &s;et the <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>proportioned</HI> Value upon each, it is impo&s;&s;ible we can act irrationally, or offend that GOD who e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>both.</HI></P>

<P>THERE is yet another Circum&s;tance ob|&s;ervable in human Nature, which &s;till fur|ther proves, that the Hope of a happy Im|mortality hath no Tendency to produce &s;elfi&s;h Affection, but its contrary. For let the <HI>&s;toical</HI> Tribe draw what Pictures they plea&s;e of the human Species, this is an un|doubted Truth, <Q REND="inline">"that <HI>Hope</HI> is the mo&s;t uni|ver&s;al Source of human <HI>Happine&s;s:</HI> And

<P>BUT beyond the&s;e Objections, the no|ble Writer hath more than once touched upon another, which merits a particular Con&s;ideration.

THE Notion here advanced is not pecu|liar to him&s;elf. He &s;eems to have drawn it from a much more con&s;iderable Writer, who hath endeavoured to &s;upport the &s;ame Propo&s;ition by a great Variety of Examples<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>BAYLE, <HI>Pen&s;. &s;ur une</HI> Comete.</BIBL></NOTE>.

<P>THE Objection, indeed, carries an Ap|pearance of Force: Yet on a near Exami|nation it entirely vani&s;heth.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be owned, that in mo&s;t Coun|tries, a con&s;iderable Part of what is called <HI>Religion,</HI> de&s;erves no other Name than that of <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> made <HI>&s;acred.</HI> And it were &s;trange indeed, &s;hould <HI>Bigotry</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e</HI> Re|ligion produce that Uprightne&s;s of Heart, that Perfection of Morals, which is the ge|nuine Effect of <HI>Truth.</HI></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be owned, that with Regard to religious Principle, as well as moral Prac|tice, every Man has the Power of being a <HI>Hypocrite.</HI> That Knaves, in order to be
<PB N="225" REF="236">
accounted <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> may appear <HI>devout.</HI> And we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, if we con&s;ider the innumerable Artifices of Villainy, that the outward Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion becomes a frequent <HI>Di&s;gui&s;e</HI> to an <HI>athei&s;tical</HI> and <HI>cor|rupted</HI> Heart.</P>
<P>BUT though the&s;e Circum&s;tances may &s;ufficiently account for the Appearance in many particular Ca&s;es, yet, with Regard to the <HI>general</HI> Fact, <HI>here</HI> &s;eems to lie the pro|per Solution of the Difficulty. <Q REND="inline">"That even where true Religion is known, profe&s;&s;ed, and in Speculation <HI>a&s;&s;ented</HI> to, it is &s;eldom &s;o thoroughly <HI>inculcated</HI> as to become a Principle of Action."</Q> We have &s;een that Imagination is the univer&s;al In&s;trument of human Action; that no Pa&s;&s;ion can be &s;trongly excited in the Soul by mere Know|ledge or A&s;&s;ent, till the Imagination hath formed to it&s;elf &s;ome kind of Picture or Repre&s;entation of the Good or Evil appre|hended<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, E&s;&s;ay I. &sect; 3.</BIBL></NOTE>. Now the Sen&s;es and their attend|ant Pa&s;&s;ions are continually urging their Demands, through the immediate Pre&s;ence of their re&s;pective Objects: So that nothing but the <HI>vivid Image</HI> of &s;ome greater Good or Evil in Futurity can po&s;&s;ibly re&s;i&s;t and
<PB N="226" REF="237">
overbalance their Sollicitations. The <HI>Idea</HI> therefore of future Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery mu&s;t be &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on the Imagi|nation, ere they can work their full Effects, becau&s;e they are <HI>di&s;tant</HI> and <HI>un&s;een:</HI> But this <HI>Habit</HI> of <HI>Reflexion</HI> is &s;eldom properly fixed by <HI>Education;</HI> and thus for want of a pro|per Impre&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"religious Principle is &s;el|dom <HI>gained,</HI> and therefore &s;eldom ope|rates."</Q></P>
<P>BUT where a &s;incere and lively Impre&s;&s;ion takes Place; where the Mind is convinced of the Being of a GOD; that he <HI>is,</HI> and is a <HI>Rewarder</HI> of them that diligently &s;eek him; where the <HI>Imagination</HI> hath gained a Habit of connecting this great Truth with every Thought, Word, and Action; there it may be ju&s;tly affirmed, that Piety and Virtue can|not but <HI>prevail.</HI> To &s;ay, in a Ca&s;e of this Nature, that Man will not act according to his Principle, is to contradict the full Evi|dence of known Facts. We &s;ee how true Mankind commonly are to their Principle of <HI>Pride,</HI> or mi&s;taken Honour; how true to their Principle of <HI>Avarice,</HI> or mi&s;taken Intere&s;t; how true to their Principle, of a Regard to <HI>human</HI> Laws. Why are they &s;o? Becau&s;e they have &s;trongly and habi|tually
<PB N="227" REF="238">
connected the&s;e Principles in their Imagination with the Idea of their own Happine&s;s. Therefore, whenever the reli|gious Principle becomes in the &s;ame Man|ner habitually connected in the Imagination, with the Agent's Happine&s;s; that is, when|ever the religious Principle takes Place at all, it mu&s;t needs become infinitely more powerful than any other; becau&s;e the <HI>Good</HI> it promi&s;eth, and the <HI>Evil</HI> it threatens, are infinitely greater and more la&s;ting. Hence it appears, that the Corruption of Mankind, even where the pure&s;t Religion is <HI>profe&s;&s;ed,</HI> and in Theory <HI>a&s;&s;ented</HI> to, doth not ari&s;e from the <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> of religious Principle, but the <HI>Want</HI> of it.</P>
<P>AND indeed on other Occa&s;ions, and to &s;erve different Purpo&s;es, the noble Writer and his Parti&s;ans can allow and give Exam|ples of all that is here contended for. No|thing is &s;o common among the&s;e Gentle|men, as to declaim again&s;t the terrible Ef|fects of <HI>prie&s;tly Power.</HI> 'Tis their favourite Topic, to repre&s;ent Mankind as groaning under the Tyranny of the <HI>&s;acred Order.</HI> Now what does this Repre&s;entation imply, but <Q REND="inline">"the Force of religious Principle im|properly directed?"</Q> If Mankind can be
<PB N="228" REF="239">
&s;wayed by religious Hope and Fear, to re|&s;ign their Pa&s;&s;ions and Intere&s;ts to the <HI>Arti|fice,</HI> or Advantage of the <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> why not to the <HI>Benefit</HI> of <HI>Mankind?</HI> 'Tis only impre&s;|&s;ing a different Idea of <HI>Duty:</HI> The Motive to Action is in both Ca&s;es the &s;ame, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be of equal Efficacy. Thus if religious Principle were void of <HI>Force,</HI> the Prie&s;thood mu&s;t be void of <HI>Power.</HI> The Influence therefore of the Prie&s;thood, however di&s;hone&s;tly applied, is a Demon&s;tration of the Force of <HI>religious Principle.</HI></P>
<P>This therefore &s;eems to be the Truth. Although, by timely and continued Cul|ture, the religious Principle might be made more univer&s;ally predominant; yet even as it is, though not &s;o thoroughly inculcated as to become generally a con&s;i&s;tent Princi|ple of Action; in Fact it hath a frequent and <HI>con&s;iderable,</HI> though <HI>partial</HI> and imper|fect Influence. None but the thoroughly Good and Bad act on continued or con|&s;i&s;tent Principles; all the intermediate De|grees of Good and Bad act at different Times on various and incon&s;i&s;tent Princi|ples; that is, their <HI>Imaginations</HI> are by turns given up to <HI>Impre&s;&s;ions</HI> of a <HI>different,</HI> or
<PB N="229" REF="240">
even <HI>contrary</HI> Nature. This explains the whole My&s;tery: For, hence it appears that the con&s;i&s;tent or incon&s;i&s;tent Conduct of Men depends not on the Nature of their Principles, but on having their Principles, whatever they are, <HI>counteracted</HI> by oppo&s;ite ones. Although therefore, through a Fai|lure of timely Di&s;cipline, Numbers of Men appear to be of that capricious Temper as not to be &s;teddy to any Principle, yet &s;till the religious one will <HI>mix</HI> with the re&s;t, and naturally <HI>prevail</HI> in its <HI>Turn.</HI> This is cer|tainly a common Circum&s;tance among the <HI>loo&s;er</HI> and more <HI>incon&s;iderate</HI> Ranks of Men; who, although by no Means uniformly &s;wayed by the Precepts of Religion, are yet frequently &s;truck with Horror at the Thought of Actions <HI>peculiarly</HI> vile, and deterred by the Apprehen&s;ion of an all-&s;eeing GOD from the Commi&s;&s;ion of Crimes <HI>uncommonly atrocious.</HI></P>
<P>HERE then lies the e&s;&s;ential Difference between the Efficacy of <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> Principle: That the fir&s;t, being a Feeling or Perception di&s;pen&s;ed in various Degrees, and in very weak ones to the Bulk of Man|kind, is incapable, even through the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous Culture, of becoming an univer&s;al
<PB N="230" REF="241">
or con&s;i&s;tent Motive to Virtue: But the re|ligious Principle, ari&s;ing from &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions as are common to the whole Species, mu&s;t, if properly inculcated, <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> prevail.</P>
<P>'Tis evident therefore, that in the very fir&s;t Dawns of Rea&s;on, religious Principles ought to be impre&s;&s;ed on the Minds of Chil|dren; and this early Culture continued through the &s;ucceeding Stages of Life. But as the noble Writer hath &s;trangely at|tempted to ridicule and di&s;honour Religion in every Shape; &s;o here, he hath endea|voured to throw an Odium on this Method of religious Di&s;cipline, by repre&s;enting it as the Enemy to true Morals and practical Phi|lo&s;ophy, as it fetters the Mind with early Prejudices. <Q REND="inline">"Whatever Manner in Phi|lo&s;ophy happens to bear the lea&s;t Re&s;em|blance to that of <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> cannot, I am per&s;uaded, of it&s;elf &s;eem very inviting. Such a &s;mart Way of que&s;tioning our|&s;elves in our Youth, has made our Man|hood more aver&s;e to the <HI>expo&s;tulatory</HI> Di&s;|cipline: And though the metaphy&s;ical Points of our Belief, are by this Method with admirable Care and Caution in&s;tilled into tender Minds; yet the Manner of this <HI>anticipating</HI> Philo&s;ophy may make

<P>IN reply to this <HI>mo&s;t philo&s;ophical</HI> Para|graph, let it be ob&s;erved; that it is not the De&s;ign of Religion to make <HI>Sophi&s;ts,</HI> but <HI>good Subjects</HI> of Mankind. That Man be|ing de&s;igned, not for <HI>Speculation,</HI> but <HI>Action,</HI> religious Principle is not to be in&s;tilled in a <HI>philo&s;ophical,</HI> but a <HI>moral</HI> View: Therefore with Regard to <HI>Practice,</HI> nothing can be more fit and rational than to impre&s;s ac|knowledged <HI>Truths</HI> at an Age when the <HI>Re|cipient</HI> is incapable of their <HI>Demon&s;trations;</HI> in the &s;ame Manner as we teach the <HI>Me|chanic</HI>
<PB N="232" REF="243">
to <HI>work</HI> on <HI>Geometric</HI> Principles, while the Proofs are <HI>unknown</HI> to him.</P>
<P>BUT then, the <HI>Prejudices of Education</HI>&mdash;yes, the&s;e are the great <HI>Stumbling-block</HI> to a modern <HI>Free-thinker:</HI> It &s;till runs in his Head, that all Mankind are born to di&s;pute <HI>de omni &s;cibili</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">On all Subjects.</NOTE>. Let therefore this <HI>mi|nute</HI> Philo&s;opher reflect, fir&s;t, that a <HI>Preju|dice</HI> doth not imply, as is generally &s;up|po&s;ed, the <HI>Fal&s;ehood</HI> of the Opinion in&s;tilled; but only that it is taken up and held with|out its proper <HI>Evidence.</HI> Thus a Child may be prejudiced in Favour of Truth, as well as Fal&s;ehood; and in him neither the one nor the other can properly be called more than an <HI>Opinion.</HI> Further: The human Mind cannot remain in a State of <HI>Indifference,</HI> with regard either to <HI>Opinion</HI> or <HI>Practice:</HI> 'Tis of an <HI>active</HI> Nature; and, like a <HI>fertile</HI> Field, if by due Cultivation it be not made to produce good <HI>Fruit,</HI> will certainly &s;pring up in <HI>Tares</HI> and <HI>Thi&s;lles.</HI> Impre&s;&s;ions, Opi|nions, <HI>Prejudices,</HI> of one kind or other a Child will inevitably contract, from the Things and Per&s;ons that <HI>&s;urround</HI> him: And if rational Habits and Opinions be not infu&s;ed, in order to <HI>anticipate</HI> Ab&s;urdities;
<PB N="233" REF="244">
Ab&s;urdities will ri&s;e, and <HI>anticipate</HI> all ra|tional Habits and Opinions. His <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and his <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> will put them&s;elves in <HI>Action,</HI> however untoward and incon&s;i&s;tent, in the &s;ame Manner as his <HI>Limbs</HI> will make an Effort towards progre&s;&s;ive <HI>Motion,</HI> how|ever awkward and ab&s;urd. The &s;ame Ob|jection therefore that lies again&s;t in&s;tilling a <HI>&s;alutary Opinion,</HI> will ari&s;e again&s;t <HI>teaching</HI> him to walk <HI>erect:</HI> For this, too, is a kind of <Q REND="inline">"<HI>anticipating</HI> Philo&s;ophy:"</Q> And &s;ure, a Child left to his own <HI>Self-Di&s;cipline,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"till he could come <HI>lei&s;urely</HI> to enquire con|cerning his <HI>real Self</HI> and <HI>End,</HI>"</Q> would &s;tand as fair a Chance to <HI>grovel</HI> in Ab&s;urdity, and bring <HI>down</HI> his Rea&s;on to the &s;ordid <HI>Level</HI> of Appetite, as to <HI>crawl</HI> upon all <HI>four,</HI> and dabble in the <HI>Dirt.</HI> Thus the noble Writer's Ridicule would &s;weep away the whole Sy&s;tem of Education along with the religious Principle: Not an Opinion or In|clination mu&s;t be controuled, or &s;o much as controverted; <Q REND="inline">"le&s;t by this <HI>anticipating</HI> Philo&s;ophy, the Work of Rea&s;on, and the inward Exerci&s;e of the Mind, at a <HI>riper</HI> Age, &s;hould proceed the more heavily, and with greater Reluctance."</Q> The Ca|price of In&s;ancy mu&s;t rule us, till the very

<P>'TIS no difficult Matter therefore to de|termine, whether a Child &s;hould be left to the Follies of his own <HI>weak</HI> Under&s;tanding and <HI>na&s;cent</HI> Pa&s;&s;ions; be left to imbibe the Maxims of corrupt Times and Manners; Maxims which, &s;etting a&s;ide all Regard to their &s;peculative Truth or Fal&s;ehood, do lead to certain Mi&s;ery; or, on the other hand, &s;hall be happily conducted to embrace tho&s;e religious Principles, which have had the Approbation of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Men in every Age and Nation; and which are known and allowed to be the only Means of true Happine&s;s to Individuals, Families, and States.</P>
<P>THIS therefore ought to be the early and principal Care of tho&s;e who have the Tui|tion of Youth: And they will &s;oon find the happy Effects of their In&s;truction. For as the Child's Under&s;tanding &s;hall improve, what was at fir&s;t in&s;tilled only as an <HI>Opinion,</HI> will by Degrees be embraced as <HI>Truth:</HI> Rea&s;on will then a&s;&s;ume her ju&s;t Empire; and the great, univer&s;al, religious Principle,

<P>IT mu&s;t be owned, the noble Writer's Caution again&s;t this <Q REND="inline">"anticipating Philo|&s;ophy"</Q> hath of late been deeply imbibed. In Con&s;equence of it, we have &s;een <HI>religious Principle</HI> declaimed again&s;t, ridiculed, la|mented. The Effect of this hath been, an abandoned Degree of Villainy in one Cla&s;s of Mankind; a lethargic Indifference to|wards Virtue or Vice in another; and in the third, which boa&s;t the Height of mo|dern Virtue, we &s;eldom &s;ee more than the fir&s;t natural Efforts, the mere <HI>Buddings</HI> of Benevolence and Honour, which are too generally bla&s;ted ere they can ripen in|to <HI>Action.</HI> This Contempt of Religion

<P>DOUBTLESS, many will treat the&s;e Ap|prehen&s;ions with <HI>Deri&s;ion:</HI> But this <HI>De|ri&s;ion</HI> is far from being an Evidence of their Fal&s;ehood. For no People ever fell a Sa|crifice to them&s;elves, till <HI>lulled</HI> and infatuated by their own Pa&s;&s;ions. <HI>Blind Security</HI> is an e&s;&s;ential Characteri&s;tic of a People devoted to De&s;truction. The Fact is equally un|deniable, whether it ari&s;eth from the moral Appointment of Providence, or the Con|nexion of natural Cau&s;es. Though this is &s;een and acknowledged by tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant with the Hi&s;tory of Mankind; yet 'tis hard to convey this Evidence to tho&s;e who &s;eldom extend their Views beyond their own &s;hort Period of Exi&s;tence; becau&s;e they &s;ee the Prevalence of the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> a&s;&s;igned, while yet the pretended <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> appears not. But they who look back into ancient Time are convinced, that the <HI>public</HI> Effects
<PB N="238" REF="249">
of <HI>Irreligion</HI> have never been &s;udden or <HI>im|mediate.</HI> One Age is <HI>fal&s;ely</HI> polite, <HI>irreli|gious,</HI> and <HI>vile;</HI> the next is &s;unk in <HI>Servi|tude</HI> and <HI>Wretchedne&s;s.</HI> This is analogous to the Operation of other Cau&s;es. A Man may be intemperate for twenty Years, be|fore he feels the Effects of Intemperance on his Con&s;titution. The Sun and Moon rai&s;e the Tides; yet the Tides ri&s;e not to their Height, till a con&s;iderable Time after the Conjunction of the&s;e two Luminaries. We cannot therefore ju&s;tly decide concerning the future <HI>Effects</HI> of Irreligion, from its pre|&s;ent State. The <HI>Examples</HI> of former Times are a much better <HI>Criterion:</HI> And the&s;e are &s;uch, as ought to make every Man among us, that regards Po&s;terity, tremble for his Po&s;terity while he reads them.</P>
<P>FOR this is but too ju&s;t an <HI>Epitome</HI> of the Story of Mankind. That TYRANNY and SUPERSTITION have ever gone Hand in Hand; mutually &s;upporting and &s;upported; taking their Progre&s;s, and fixing their Do|minion over all the Kingdoms of the Earth; overwhelming it in one general Deluge, as the Waters cover the Sea.

<P>IN the Cour&s;e of the preceding <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> we have &s;een the noble Writer a&s;&s;um|ing the Character of the profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Dog|mati&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Rea&s;oner</HI> in <HI>Form.</HI> In what re|mains to be con&s;idered, concerning <HI>revealed Religion</HI> and CHRISTIANITY, we &s;hall find him chiefly affecting the <HI>mi&s;cellaneous</HI> Capa|city;
<PB N="242" REF="252">
the Way of <HI>Chat, Raillery, Innuendo,</HI> or <HI>Story-telling:</HI> In a Word, that very Species of the pre&s;ent modi&s;h Compo&s;ition, which he &s;o contemptuou&s;ly ridicules; <Q REND="inline">"where, as he tells us, Ju&s;tne&s;s and Accuracy of Thought are &s;et a&s;ide as too con&s;training; where Grounds and Foundations are of no Moment; and which hath properly neither <HI>Top</HI> nor <HI>Bottom, Beginning</HI> nor <HI>End</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> i. &sect; 2.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> In this, however, his Lord&s;hip is not quite &s;o much to blame as might be imagined. In his Critical Progre&s;s, he had treated this <HI>di&s;habille</HI> of Compo&s;ition, as the Man in the Fable did his Pears; uncon|&s;cious he &s;hould be ever afterwards reduced to diet on them him&s;elf. The Truth of the Matter is, that the broken Hints, the ambiguous Expre&s;&s;ion, and the Ludicro-&s;erious of the gentle E&s;&s;ayi&s;t, perfectly &s;ecure him from the rough Handling of the Logical-Di&s;puter.</P>
<P>INDEED the noble Author has a double Advantage from this <HI>Cloud,</HI> in which the <HI>Graces</HI> &s;o frequently &s;ecure their Favourite. He not only eludes the Force of every Ar|gument the Defenders of Chri&s;tianity alledge in it's Support, but even pleads the Privilege of
<PB N="243" REF="253">
being ranked in the Number of <HI>&s;incere</HI> Chri&s;|tians. He takes frequent Occa&s;ions of expre&s;&s;|ing his Abhorrence of <HI>idle Scepticks</HI> and <HI>wicked Unbelievers</HI> in Religion: He declares him&s;elf of a more re&s;igned Under&s;tanding, a ductile Faith, ready to be moulded into any Shape that his &s;piritual Superiors &s;hall pre&s;cribe. At other Times, and in innu|merable Places, he &s;catters &s;uch In&s;inuations again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> and that too with all the Bitterne&s;s of <HI>Sarca&s;m</HI> and <HI>Invective,</HI> as mu&s;t needs be more effectual in promoting <HI>Irreli|gion,</HI> than a formal and avowed Accu&s;ation. For in the Way of open War, there is fair Warning given to put Rea&s;on upon Guard, that no pretending Argument be &s;uffered to pa&s;s without Examination. On the con|trary, the noble Writer's concealed Method of <HI>Raillery,</HI> &s;teals in&s;en&s;ibly on his Reader; fills him with endle&s;s Prejudice and Su&s;pi|cion; and, without pa&s;&s;ing thro' the <HI>Judg|ment,</HI> &s;ixeth &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions on the Imagi|nation, as <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> with all its Effects, will be hardly able afterwards to efface.</P>
<P>THESE incon&s;i&s;tent Circum&s;tances in his Lord&s;hip's Conduct, have made it a Que&s;|tion among &s;ome, what his real Sentiments were concerning Religion and <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI>
<PB N="244" REF="254">
If it be nece&s;&s;ary to decide this Que&s;tion, we may ob&s;erve, that a di&s;gui&s;ed Unbe|liever may have his Rea&s;ons for making a formal Declaration of his A&s;&s;ent to the Re|ligion of his Country: But it will be hard to find what &s;hould tempt a real <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> to load <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> with Scorn and <HI>Infamy.</HI> Indeed, the noble Writer, to do him Ju&s;tice, never de&s;igned to leave us at a Lo&s;s on this Subject. For he hath been &s;o good, fre|quently to remind his Reader, to <HI>look out</HI> for the true Drift of his <HI>Irony,</HI> le&s;t his real Meaning &s;hould be mi&s;taken or di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>HERE then lies the Force of his Lord&s;hip's Attack on <HI>Chri&s;tianity;</HI> <Q REND="inline">"In exciting Con|tempt by Ridicule."</Q> A Method which, as we have already &s;een<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> i. pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>, tho' devoid of all ra|tional Foundation, is yet mo&s;t powerful and efficacious in working upon vulgar Minds. Thus the Way of <HI>Irony,</HI> and fal&s;e Enco|mium, which he &s;o often employs again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed Founder of our Religion, &s;erves him for all Weapons; the deeper he &s;trikes the Wound, the better he &s;hields him&s;elf.</P>
<P>WE are not therefore to be &s;urprized, if we find the noble Writer frequently affect|ing a Mixture of <HI>&s;olemn Phra&s;e</HI> and <HI>low</HI>

<P>AS to the Expectation of future Happine&s;s con&s;idered, as the natural Con&s;equence of virtuous Action; his Lord&s;hip hath not, that I know of, either a&s;&s;irmed, or in&s;inuated any thing again&s;t it's Rea&s;onablene&s;s.

<P>IN his Letter on <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> he hath ob|liged us with &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of this Kind. The&s;e, it mu&s;t be owned, are &s;o ob&s;cure, that we mu&s;t be content, to refer them rather to the Reader's equitable Con&s;truction, than urge them as direct Proofs.</P>
<P>THE Apprehen&s;ion and <HI>Fear</HI> of &s;ome|thing <HI>&s;upernatural,</HI> &s;o univer&s;al among Man|kind, he &s;eems all along to deride, as a vi&s;ionary and <HI>groundle&s;s Pannic</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Let. on Enthu&s;.</HI> pa&s;&s;im.</BIBL></NOTE>.

utmo&s;t of his Power: For the Force of <HI>re|ligious Sanctions</HI> depends as much on their being believed, as the Force of <HI>human Laws</HI> depends on their being executed. To <HI>de|&s;troy</HI> the <HI>Belief</HI> of the <HI>one</HI> therefore, is equi|valent to &s;u&s;pending the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>BUT as the pre&s;ent Debate concerns not the <HI>Utility,</HI> but the <HI>Truth</HI> of <HI>Religion;</HI> 'tis chiefly incumbent on us, to &s;hew, that the noble Writer's <HI>Opinion</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;oning,</HI> on this Subject, are void of all Foundation.</P>
<P>'TIS ob&s;ervable therefore, Fir&s;t, that his Lord&s;hip, in other Places, allows that <Q REND="inline">"If there be naturally &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion as Enthu|&s;ia&s;m, 'tis evident, that Religion it&s;elf is of the Kind, and mu&s;t be therefore natural to Man<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Mi&s;c.</HI> ii. c. 1.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> And in his <HI>Letter on Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> even while he derides the Pronene&s;s of Mankind to the <HI>con&s;cientious Fear,</HI> he adds, <Q REND="inline">"that tho' Epicurus thought the&s;e Appre|hen&s;ions were <HI>vain,</HI> yet he was forced to allow them in a Manner <HI>innate:</HI>"&mdash;"From which Conce&s;&s;ion, a <HI>Divine,</HI> me|thinks, might rai&s;e a <HI>goood Argument</HI> again&s;t him, for the <HI>Truth</HI> as well as <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s</HI> of Religion."</Q> Now as &s;ome may po&s;&s;ibly be at a Lo&s;s to determine here,
<PB N="249" REF="259">
whether the noble Writer be in <HI>Je&s;t</HI> or <HI>Earne&s;t,</HI> the Argument he hints at is plainly this: That if we look round the Works of Nature, we &s;hall find an Analogy e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, which &s;eems a Proof, that this natural Fear which <HI>pre&s;&s;eth</HI> &s;o univer&s;ally on the human Mind, hath a real and proportioned Object. The Argument hath been urged by many of great Name, in Favour of the <HI>Hope</HI> of future <HI>Good;</HI> and 'tis &s;urely of equal Force, whatever that Force may be, when apply'd to the <HI>Fear</HI> of future <HI>Ill.</HI> For we &s;ee thro' the whole Creation, every Animal of whatever Species, directed by it's Nature or the Hand of Providence, to fear and &s;hun it's proper and appointed Enemy. We find the&s;e Apprehen&s;ions univer&s;ally &s;uited to the Nature and Pre&s;ervation of every Species among Birds, Bea&s;ts, Fi&s;hes, In&s;ects. Nor is there one <HI>Fear,</HI> tho' &s;ome|times <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> in it's <HI>Degree,</HI> that is <HI>erroneous</HI> with Regard to it's <HI>Object.</HI> The <HI>religious Fear,</HI> therefore, which <HI>forceth it&s;elf</HI> &s;o uni|ver&s;ally on the human Mind, in every Age and Nation, ignorant or knowing, civilized or barbarous; hath <HI>probably</HI> an Object &s;uited to it's Nature, ordained for the Welfare of the human Species. At lea&s;t, this Argu|ment
<PB N="250" REF="260">
mu&s;t ever be of Weight with tho&s;e, who draw their Ideas of future Exi&s;tence from the <HI>In&s;tincts, Hopes,</HI> and <HI>Expectations</HI> of the human Mind.</P>
<P>INDEED, on the noble Writer's refined Scheme of Morals, in which the natural Affections of the Mind are repre&s;ented, as all-&s;ufficient for the Purpo&s;es of human Happine&s;s, this Argument mu&s;t lo&s;e it's Force; becau&s;e, on this Suppo&s;ition, the re|ligious Fear is <HI>&s;upernumerary</HI> and <HI>u&s;ele&s;s:</HI> But then this &s;hews the Suppo&s;ition it&s;elf to be <HI>mon&s;trous, ab&s;urd,</HI> and contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Cour&s;e of Nature; becau&s;e Na|ture gives no Power or Pa&s;&s;ion, but to &s;ome proper and appointed End: The very <HI>Ex|i&s;tence</HI> of the Pa&s;&s;ion, therefore, is a Proof of it's Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>NOW, if indeed the religious Fear be <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> as, we pre&s;ume, hath been &s;uffi|ciently proved in the preceding E&s;&s;ay; then, from hence will ari&s;e a &s;trong and convincing Proof, that the Object of reli|gious Fear is <HI>real.</HI> For we find thro' the whole Extent of created Being, that the Author of Nature hath annexed to all his De&s;igns and Purpo&s;es, the proper Means or Objects, by which they may be fulfilled.
<PB N="251" REF="261">
As therefore the religious Fear is not only interwoven with the Frame of Man, but <HI>ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to his <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> it's Ob|ject mu&s;t be <HI>real;</HI> becau&s;e, if <HI>not,</HI> you &s;up|po&s;e the Creator to have given a NECESSA|RY <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> without it's <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>appointed Object;</HI> which would be a Contradiction to the <HI>univer&s;al</HI> and <HI>known Con&s;titution</HI> of Things.</P>
<P>ON this Occa&s;ion, we may ob&s;erve the Weakne&s;s of the <HI>Epicurean</HI> Sy&s;tem, concern|ing <HI>Providence:</HI> For that Sect hath ever deny'd, that the Deity concerns him&s;elf with the <HI>moral</HI> Conduct of Man. But from the wi&s;e and benevolent Con&s;titution of the natural World it&s;elf, a &s;trong Proof ari&s;eth in Support of GOD's <HI>moral</HI> Government of it, and of the Truth of the <HI>Fears</HI> and <HI>Ex|pectations</HI> of the human Mind. For if we allow that he regards and pre&s;erves the natural Order and Symmetry of the Crea|tion; that he hath formed this immen&s;e Sy&s;tem of Being, and &s;ecured it's Continu|ance and Welfare, by certain Laws, nece&s;|&s;ary to the Happine&s;s of his Creatures; then we mu&s;t on the &s;ame Foundation conclude, that he hath likewi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch <HI>Mo|tives</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Action,</HI> as may determine
<PB N="252" REF="262">
<HI>Man</HI> to pro&s;ecute the &s;ame End. It were an Imputation on the Wi&s;dom of the Deity, to conceive him as <HI>doing</HI> the <HI>one,</HI> and <HI>omit|ting</HI> the <HI>other:</HI> Unle&s;s <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Morals</HI> be le&s;s worthy of his Regard, than <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Motion.</HI></P>
<P>BUT &s;till the noble Writer proceeds in the Spirit of Deri&s;ion, to expo&s;e the Ab|&s;urdities and Mi&s;chiefs this mi&s;guided reli|gious Principle hath occa&s;ioned; he often expatiates on the <HI>&s;uper&s;titious Horrors,</HI> and <HI>&s;urious Zeal</HI> which have had their Source in this <HI>Principle;</HI> and thence, in the Way of In&s;inuation, concludes it <HI>irrational</HI> and <HI>groundle&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>THE Facts, it mu&s;t be owned, are no|torious and undeniable: But the Con&s;e|quence is no le&s;s evidently chimerical and vain. Lord SHAFTESBURY him&s;elf hath ob&s;erved, that in Failure of a <HI>ju&s;t Prince</HI> or <HI>Magi&s;trate,</HI> Mankind are ready to &s;ub|mit them&s;elves even to a <HI>Tyrant:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Like new-born Creatures, who have never &s;een their <HI>Dam,</HI> they will fancy one for them&s;elves, and apply (as by Nature prompted) to &s;ome like Form for Favour and Protection.

Again he hath remarked, that <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Heroi&s;m</HI> and <HI>Philanthropy</HI> are almo&s;t one and the &s;ame; yet by a &s;mall Mi&s;guidance of the Affection, a Lover of Mankind becomes a Ravager; a Hero and Deli|verer becomes an Oppre&s;&s;or and De&s;troy|er<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Ib. &sect; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> 'Tis the &s;ame in Religion.

the mo&s;t pernicious and de&s;tructive: Hence indeed, <Q REND="inline">"by a &s;mall Mi&s;guidance of the Affection, a <HI>Lover of Mankind</HI> be|comes a <HI>Ravager;</HI> a <HI>Saint,</HI> an <HI>Oppre&s;&s;or</HI> and <HI>De&s;troyer.</HI>"</Q> But as from the Abu&s;e of the <HI>&s;ocial</HI> Principle, &s;o here, in that of the <HI>religious</HI> one, no other Con&s;equence can be ju&s;tly drawn, but that it is <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>&s;trong.</HI></P>
<P>BUT further, the noble Writer finds the Notion of future Puni&s;hment, <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent</HI> with his Idea of <HI>divine Goodne&s;s.</HI> Therefore, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"We can have no Dread or Su&s;|picion to make us unea&s;y: For it is <HI>Malice only,</HI> and not <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> which can make us afraid<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Enq.</HI> B. ii.

and ju&s;t Object of Fear to an ill Man. Malice may be appea&s;ed or &s;atiated: Humour may change: But Goodne&s;s is as a fixed, &s;teady immoveable Principle of Action. If either of the Former holds the Sword of Ju&s;tice, there is plainly Ground for the greate&s;t of Crimes to hope for Impunity. But if it be Goodne&s;s, there can be no po&s;&s;ible Hope, whil&s;t the Rea&s;ons of things, or the Ends of Government call for Puni&s;hment. Thus every one &s;ees how much greater Chance of Impunity an ill Man has, in a partial Admini&s;tration, than in a ju&s;t and up|right one. It is &s;aid, that the Intere&s;t or Good of the Whole, mu&s;t be the Intere&s;t of the univer&s;al Being; and that he can have no other. Be it &s;o.

What Shadow of Rea&s;on then is there to a&s;&s;ert, that this may not be the Ca&s;e hereafter?

<P>HOWEVER, for the Satisfaction of tho&s;e who may think it nece&s;&s;ary, a &s;ummary View of the Evidence is here &s;ubjoined,</P>
<P>THE Authenticity, therefore, of the Books of the <HI>new Te&s;tament,</HI> appears to be founded on the &s;tronge&s;t moral Evidence, becau&s;e from the earlie&s;t Ages, we find them a&s;cribed to the Apo&s;tles and Evangeli&s;ts, who&s;e Names they bear. Thus St PAUL's Epi&s;tles are mentioned by St. PETER, and cited by CLEMENS ROMANUS, who lived in the Reign of CLAUDIUS, even before St PAUL was carried Pri&s;oner to ROME. PO|LYCARP and IRENAEUS were for &s;ome Time contemporary with St. JOHN: They both cite
<PB N="264" REF="274">
the four Go&s;pels, and affirm they were all wrote by the Apo&s;tles and Evangeli&s;ts, who&s;e Names they bear. JUSTIN MARTYR and CLEMENS ALEXANDRINUS, confirm their Accounts in the following Century: And the great ORIGEN, with whom I &s;hall clo&s;e the Catalogue, and who lived in the Reign of SEVERUS, in his Book again&s;t CELSUS hath cited <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Go&s;pels,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t,</HI> if not <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Epi&s;tles,</HI> under the Names they now bear: And the Words of the &s;everal Citations per|fectly agree with tho&s;e of the new Te&s;tament, now in U&s;e. Such a full Proof of the Genuinene&s;s of the&s;e &s;acred Records, as is not to be parallel'd, concerning any other Book, of <HI>equal</HI> or even of much <HI>le&s;s Anti|quity.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>internal</HI> Proof of their Genuinene&s;s, ari&s;ing from their <HI>Style</HI> and <HI>Compo&s;ition,</HI> is no le&s;s eminent and particular. The Genius of every Book, is &s;o perfectly agreeable to the Character and Education of it's re&s;pec|tive Author; every Cu&s;tom de&s;cribed or alluded to, either <HI>Jewi&s;h, Greek,</HI> or <HI>Roman,</HI> &s;o entirely &s;uited to the <HI>Times;</HI> every Inci|dent &s;o <HI>natural,</HI> &s;o <HI>occa&s;ional,</HI> &s;o <HI>particular,</HI> &s;o perfectly <HI>identify'd,</HI> that it were the very

<P>THAT the Go&s;pel-Hi&s;tory hath been tran&s;|mitted to us, <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>uncorrupted,</HI> we have no le&s;s Rea&s;on to believe. 'Tis well known how zealous the primitive Chri&s;tians were in the Pre&s;ervation of the Scriptures: We know, they regarded them as their chief and deare&s;t Trea&s;ure; and often laid down their Lives, rather than deliver the &s;acred Records to their Enemies, who u&s;ed every Art of Terror, to &s;eize and de&s;troy them. Again, the Scriptures were not then locked up from the Laity, as now in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church: But Copies were taken, di&s;per&s;ed, and became immen&s;ely numerous. They were univer&s;ally read at the Times of pub|lic Wor&s;hip, in different Nations of the World. To this we may add, that as <HI>now,</HI> &s;o <HI>then,</HI> different Sects and Parties &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, who all appealed to Scripture for Proof of their &s;everal Opinions; and the&s;e, 'tis evi|dent, mu&s;t have been &s;o many <HI>Checks</HI> upon each other, to the general Exclu&s;ion of Mi&s;take and Fraud<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>The JEWS and SAMARITANS were <HI>Checks</HI> upon each other in the &s;ame Manner, for the Pre&s;ervation of the Purity of the <HI>Pentatouch.</HI> The <HI>Samaritan Penta|touch</HI> was printed in the la&s;t Century: And, <Q REND="inline">"after <HI>Two thou&s;and Years</HI> Di&s;cord between the Two Na|tions, varies as little from the other, as any <HI>Cla&s;&s;ic</HI> Author in le&s;s Tract of Time has di&s;agreed from it|&s;elf, by the <HI>unavoidable Mi&s;takes</HI> of &s;o many <HI>Tran|&s;cribers.</HI>"</Q> <BIBL>See <HI>Phil.

THIS being the real State of the Ca&s;e; let us now con&s;ider the noble Writer's Que&s;tions.

There are many Books, concerning which there never was <HI>any Doubt.</HI> There are &s;ome, concerning which the Doubts have been fully <HI>cleared up.</HI> There are others, concerning which the Doubts have been <HI>confirmed.</HI> Of the fir&s;t Kind are <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Go&s;pels,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Epi&s;tles:</HI> Of the &s;econd, are the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> the <HI>&s;econd</HI> of <HI>Peter, &s;econd</HI> and <HI>third</HI> of <HI>John,</HI> that of <HI>Jude,</HI> and the <HI>Apocalyp&s;e:</HI> Of the third Kind, are the <HI>apocryphal</HI> Books; therefore indeed &s;o call|ed.</P>
<P>THE noble Author goes on. <Q REND="inline">"The <HI>&s;ingle</HI> read, or that of <HI>various</HI> Reading?"</Q>
<PB N="267" REF="277">
My Lord, if by &s;ingle read you mean a Book in which there are no various Readings, there are none <HI>&s;ingle read:</HI> Nor, probably, was there ever any Book <HI>&s;ingle read,</HI> that went thro' more than one Edition: at lea&s;t, before the Invention of <HI>Printing.</HI> And as the Scriptures were oftener tran&s;cribed than any other Book, &s;o, a greater Variety of of Readings mu&s;t naturally take Place.

Yet 'tis certain, that however the&s;e Parties differed in Opinions, we find from their Writings now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, that they all appealed to one common Scripture for their Support.</P>
<P>THE noble Writer takes his Leave by paying a Compliment to the&s;e primitive Writers called the Fathers of the Church. <Q REND="inline">"How the&s;e &s;acred Records were <HI>guarded</HI> in tho&s;e Ages, might be ea&s;ily <HI>imagined,</HI>" &amp;c.</Q>&mdash;But to <HI>imagine,</HI> is a much ea&s;ier Ta&s;k than to <HI>prove;</HI> e&s;pecially when Ima|gination is helped forward by Inclination. <HI>Guarded</HI> indeed they were, as we have &s;een, from Interpolation and Fal&s;hood.

They were far from acting or writing with a View to temporal Advantage; they were &s;truggling under the Weight of heavy Per|&s;ecutions; had no Motives to preach or write, but the great Expectation of Happi|ne&s;s hereafter, founded on a firm Belief of that holy Religion, which they propagated with an Effect <HI>almo&s;t,</HI> if not <HI>indeed, miracu|lous.</HI></P>
<P>ON this Occa&s;ion I cannot but ob&s;erve a &s;trange In&s;inuation thrown out el&s;ewhere by the noble Writer; which, however, is &s;o glaring a Fal&s;hood, that he finds him&s;elf obliged to di&s;avow it, even while he labours to impre&s;s it on his Reader's Imagina|tion, in all the Colours of Eloquence. <Q REND="inline">"If,

Vail of the Temple was rent in twain: A general Darkne&s;s involved, and an Earth|quake &s;hook, the City. The &s;ame Omni|potence by which he wrought his Miracles, rai&s;ed him from the Grave; and after a &s;hort &s;tay on Earth, during which he &s;trengthened and confirmed his de&s;ponding Followers, tran&s;lated him to Heaven. And now, a new and <HI>unexpected</HI> Scene of divine and miraculous Power opened on Mankind, for the full E&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> The Spirit of God came down, and dwelt with the Apo&s;tles; they were all filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, and &s;pake with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them Utterance. They were inve&s;ted with &s;upernatural Power to heal Di&s;ea&s;es; were impowered to &s;trike dead the deceitful ANANIAS and SAPPHI|RA; and when impri&s;oned, were delivered by the immediate Hand of GOD. By the&s;e Means, Chri&s;tianity gained a numerous Train of Pro&s;elytes among the JEWS; but the great Work of converting the Gentiles was not yet begun. To this End the Apo&s;tle PAUL was de&s;tined; and converted to Chri&s;tianity by an amazing Act of &s;uper|natural and divine Power. In this impor|tant Mini&s;try he was frequently pre&s;erved
<PB N="281" REF="293">
by the miraculous Care of Providence; did him&s;elf perform &s;tupendous Acts of Power and Beneficence; by the&s;e Means convert|ing Multitudes among the Gentiles, and planting Chri&s;tianity in the mo&s;t knowing and poli&s;hed Nations of the Earth.</P>
<P>TO this irre&s;i&s;tible Chain of Evidence, ari&s;ing from the miraculous Exertion of divine Power, we may add another <HI>collate|ral</HI> Proof, ari&s;ing from the <HI>miraculous</HI> Em|anations of divine <HI>Fore-knowledge,</HI> recorded in the Bible, and delivered in PROPHECY thro' a Series of Ages, all <HI>centering</HI> in the &s;ame Point, the foretelling the <HI>Completion</HI> of this immen&s;e Plan of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Good|ne&s;s.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Predictions</HI> were fulfilled in the Advent, Life, Death, and Re&s;urrection of our <HI>Saviour;</HI> who him&s;elf foretold the Succe&s;s of his Apo&s;tles among the Gentiles, and the final Di&s;&s;olution of the Jewi&s;h Po|lity. This came to pa&s;s in the De&s;truction of the <HI>Temple:</HI> And when a bitter Enemy to Chri&s;tianity attempted to make void the Decrees of Heaven in rebuilding this <HI>Temple,</HI> (the only Circum&s;tance of Union that could ever make the JEWS <HI>once more a People</HI>) the very Foundations were rent in Pieces by an
<PB N="282" REF="294">
Earthquake, and the mad A&s;&s;ailants again&s;t <HI>Omnipotence</HI> buryed in the Ruins.</P>
<P>FROM this mighty <HI>Union,</HI> therefore, ari&s;eth a Proof &s;imilar to that which we ob|tain from the Works of Nature. For as in <HI>the&s;e</HI> we &s;ee the Happine&s;s of the Crea|tion <HI>intended, plann'd,</HI> and <HI>produced,</HI> and from hence di&s;cover the Agency of the Deity: So in the Progre&s;s and Completion of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> we find a parallel Di&s;play of the divine Attributes: We &s;ee the Advance|ment of Man's Happine&s;s <HI>determined</HI> by divine GOODNESS, <HI>plann'd</HI> by divine WIS|DOM, <HI>foretold</HI> by divine KNOWLEDGE, <HI>ac|compli&s;hed</HI> by divine POWER: and hence, as in <HI>Nature,</HI> obtain a full <HI>Manife&s;tation, Proof,</HI> or <HI>Revelation</HI> of the DEITY.</P>
<P>AS this &s;eems to be the true Light, in which the Evidence ari&s;ing from the Scrip|ture-Miracles ought to be placed, it may be proper now to add a few Ob&s;ervations on what hath been offered on this Subject, both by the <HI>Defenders</HI> and the <HI>Adver&s;aries</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. AS to the Degree of Proof or Evi|dence ari&s;ing from a <HI>&s;ingle Miracle</HI> in Sup|port of any <HI>particular Doctrine;</HI> whatever Force it may carry, 'tis a Point, which we
<PB N="283" REF="295">
are by no Means at pre&s;ent concerned to de|termine: Becau&s;e, as we have &s;een, in the Progre&s;s of the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation, there is a va&s;t <HI>Series</HI> or <HI>Chain,</HI> all <HI>uniting</HI> in one common End.

It &s;hould therefore &s;eem, that the Defenders of Chri&s;tianity have generally &s;et this Evidence in too <HI>detached</HI> and <HI>par|ticular</HI> a Light: For tho' the Proof ari&s;ing from a &s;ingle Miracle, in Support of a par|ticular Doctrine may be of &s;ufficient Force to convince an equitable Mind; yet &s;ure, 'tis infinitely &s;tronger and more &s;atisfactory, if we <HI>view at once</HI> the whole <HI>Chain</HI> of Mira|cles, by which the great Scheme of <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity</HI> was propagated, as <HI>one</HI> va&s;t <HI>Object:</HI> Becau&s;e in this View, we di&s;cover innume|rable Circum&s;tances of <HI>mutual Relation</HI> and

<P N="2">II.

<PB N="290" REF="302">
Miracles, without rejecting at the &s;ame Time the whole Hi&s;tory in which they are contained.

<P>I cannot conclude this Argument with|out tran&s;cribing a noble Pa&s;&s;age from the Book of <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> where &s;everal of the&s;e Truths are finely illu&s;trated: And which may convince us, how ju&s;t an Idea the JEWS entertained of <HI>miraculous Interpo&s;ition,</HI> beyond what their Enemies have indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly repre&s;ented.

<P>THE only Circum&s;tance we are concern|ed <HI>calmly</HI> to examine, is that of <HI>religious En|thu&s;ia&s;m:</HI> Chiefly, to point out the e&s;&s;ential Qualities and Characteri&s;tics which di&s;|tingui&s;h <HI>this</HI> from <HI>divine In&s;piration:</HI> Hence to prove, that our <HI>Saviour</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were not <HI>religious Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> as the noble Writer hath &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>'TIS indeed, as his Lord&s;hip ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">"a great Work to judge of Spirits, whether they be of God."</Q> We &s;hall willingly join him in this Principle too, <Q REND="inline">"that in or|der to this End, we mu&s;t antecedently judge our own Spirit, whether it be of Rea&s;on or &s;ound Sen&s;e, free of every bya&s;&s;ing Pa&s;&s;ion, every giddy Vapour, or melancholy Fume.

Spirit we are of. Afterwards we may judge the Spirit in others, con&s;ider what their per&s;onal Merit is, and prove the Va|lidity of their Te&s;timony by the Solidity of their Brain."</Q> On this Principle then let the Cau&s;e be determined.</P>
<P>IN examining this Subject, therefore, we &s;hall find, Fir&s;t, that in <HI>&s;ome</HI> Re&s;pects, <HI>En|thu&s;ia&s;m</HI> mu&s;t, from it's Nature, always re|&s;emble <HI>divine In&s;piration.</HI> Secondly, that in others it hath generally attempted a fur|ther Re&s;emblance, but hath always betrayed it&s;elf.

<P>FIRST, <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> mu&s;t, from it's very Nature, in &s;ome Re&s;pects always re&s;emble divine <HI>In&s;piration.</HI> They both have the <HI>Deity</HI> for their Object; and con&s;equently mu&s;t both be attended with a devout Turn of Mind. They mu&s;t both be &s;ubject to &s;trong and unu&s;ual Impre&s;&s;ions; the one <HI>&s;upernatural;</HI> the other <HI>praeternatural,</HI> that is, beyond the ordinary Efforts of Nature, tho' really produced by Nature; <HI>the&s;e,</HI> thro' their uncommon Force, will often re&s;emble, and not ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>tho&s;e</HI>
<PB N="295" REF="307">
which are the real Effect of <HI>&s;upernatural</HI> Power. This Circum&s;tance de&s;erves a par|ticular Attention: For the&s;e two Qualities which are common to both, have induced many to reject the very Notion of divine In&s;piration, as mere Ethu&s;ia&s;m. Whereas we &s;ee, that, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a thing as di|vine <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> it cannot but re&s;emble <HI>En|thu&s;ia&s;m</HI> in the&s;e two Characters.</P>
<P>BUT tho' it were &s;trange, if <HI>Counterfeits</HI> did not hit off &s;ome Features of their genuine <HI>Originals;</HI> yet it were more &s;trange, if they &s;hould be able to adopt them all, by &s;uch a perfect Imitation as to prevent their being detected.</P>
<P>THERE are, therefore, &s;econdly, other Circum&s;tances in which <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> hath generally attempted a further Re&s;emblance of divine <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> but in the&s;e hath al|ways betrayed it&s;elf <HI>&s;purious.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of this Kind is, <Q REND="inline">"A Pretence to, and Per&s;ua&s;ion of the Power of work|ing <HI>Miracles.</HI>"</Q> This Per&s;ua&s;ion mu&s;t needs be natural to the Enthu&s;ia&s;t; becau&s;e he imagines him&s;elf in all things highly favoured of Heaven: The Notion of a Communication of <HI>divine Power</HI> will there|fore be among the chief of his <HI>Deliriums.</HI>
<PB N="296" REF="308">
In this the Enthu&s;ia&s;t hath been detected, <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> by the <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> of the Miracle attempted, <HI>always</HI> by his <HI>Inability</HI> to per|form what he propo&s;ed. There is &s;carce an <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> &s;o great, but what hath &s;ome Time or other been aimed at by Enthu|&s;ia&s;ts, in the Way of miraculous Power.

<PB N="297" REF="309">
Prejudices; and therefore could not po&s;|&s;ibly be under the Influence of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;uch.

<P>BUT there is <HI>one</HI> miraculous Gift, <HI>the Gift of Tongues,</HI> which hath more generally been &s;uppo&s;ed the peculiar Effect of In&s;pi|ration.

the Account, that it could not have been &s;o attended: And from the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> it appears how proper it was, with Regard to it's <HI>End.</HI> The Recital is noble and rational: Let it an&s;wer for it&s;elf. <Q REND="inline">"And there were dwelling at Jeru&s;alem, JEWS, devout Men, out of <HI>every Nation</HI> under Heaven.&mdash;And they were all amazed, and marvelled, &s;aying one to another, Behold, are not all the&s;e which &s;peak, <HI>Galileans?</HI> And how hear we <HI>every</HI> Man in <HI>our own Tongue,</HI> wherein we were born? <HI>Parthians,</HI> and <HI>Medes,</HI> and <HI>Elamites,</HI> the Dwellers in <HI>Me|&s;opotamia,</HI> and in <HI>Judea,</HI> and <HI>Cappodocia,</HI> in <HI>Pontus</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia, Phrygia</HI> and <HI>Pam|phylia,</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and in the Parts of <HI>Libya</HI> about <HI>Cyrene:</HI> And Strangers of <HI>Rome; Jews</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;elytes, Cretes</HI> and <HI>Arabians;</HI> we do <HI>hear them &s;peak in our Tongues the wonderful Works of God!</HI>"</Q> How ju&s;t an Effort of divine Power! which &s;hould at once give <HI>In&s;truction</HI> to tho&s;e who mo&s;t wanted it; and be the <HI>natural Means</HI> of conveying and <HI>di&s;per&s;ing</HI> the glad Tydings of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> to <HI>every Nation under Heaven!</HI>&mdash;It &s;hould &s;eem probable, therefore, that the Men who <Q REND="inline">"mocked and &s;aid, the&s;e Men are full of new Wine,"</Q> were the <HI>Natives of</HI>

<P>THE la&s;t Quality common to Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, is that of <HI>Ignorance.</HI> This hath been &s;ome|times charged on our Saviour him&s;elf: often on his Apo&s;tles with an Air of Triumph. But &s;o it is, that <HI>&s;eeming Objections</HI> again&s;t Truth become often the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t Evidence</HI> in Support of it.

<P>NOW, that the Apo&s;tles and Evangeli&s;ts were <HI>unlearned,</HI> mu&s;t needs be granted: And tho' the noble Writer hath taken upon him to deride them on this Account; yet
<PB N="311" REF="323">
this very Circum&s;tance, compared with their Conduct and Writings, clears them at once from the Charge of Enthu&s;ia&s;m.

<P>AS to the Charge of Ignorance again&s;t our Saviour, the Enemies of Chri&s;tianity have been more <HI>cautious:</HI> Yet it hath been in&s;inuated.

Secondly, even Philo&s;ophers them&s;elves, tho' inti|mately acquainted with the Con&s;truction of the Univer&s;e, do &s;till <HI>de&s;cend</HI> to the <HI>Level of Mankind,</HI> when they &s;peak of the Phae|nomena of Nature: The <HI>Sun &s;ets</HI> and <HI>ri&s;es,</HI> as it did three thou&s;and Years ago: The <HI>Moon changes, wains,</HI> is <HI>new,</HI> and <HI>old:</HI> The <HI>Stars</HI> are <HI>in the Firmament,</HI> the <HI>Sun</HI>

&s;till <HI>rules the Day,</HI> and the <HI>Moon</HI> the <HI>Night.</HI> The Rea&s;on is evident: Becau&s;e <HI>a&s;tronomi|cal Di&s;coveries</HI> have not the lea&s;t Influence on the <HI>Practice of Mankind:</HI> Becau&s;e, altho' the <HI>natural Appearances</HI> of things are merely <HI>relative</HI> to the <HI>Imagination only,</HI> yet they are, for that very Rea&s;on, nece&s;&s;ary to be referred to, as the <HI>Imagination</HI> is the great <HI>univer&s;al In&s;trument</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> and human <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P>AN Objection therefore to the Scriptures on this Account, betrays either a gro&s;s <HI>Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion</HI> of human Nature, or the mo&s;t unpardonable <HI>In&s;incerity;</HI> yet we find Objections of this kind frequently urged: as if, becau&s;e the &s;acred Penmen were im|powered by God to reveal to us a certain Mea&s;ure of <HI>religious</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> Truth, &s;uited to our pre&s;ent State, they mu&s;t therefore be endued with <HI>Omni&s;cience;</HI> in order to make all Men not only <HI>good Subjects,</HI> but good <HI>A&s;tronomers</HI> too!</P>

<HI>Truths</HI> becomes a convincing Proof of their VERACITY: A Circum&s;tance which much more nearly concerns us.

<P>THE noble Writer's other Charge re|lating to the <HI>moral Repre&s;entations</HI> of the
<PB N="327" REF="339">
Scriptures, would indeed be of Weight, if it were founded in Truth: But &s;o far from this, that he hath utterly <HI>rever&s;ed</HI> the Fact.

<HI>Crime,</HI> becau&s;e it tends to produce the mo&s;t fatal Con&s;equences.

<L>For which our Country is a Name &s;o dear<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Samp&s;on Agoni&s;tes.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>.</L></Q>
Now 'tis evident beyond a Doubt, that at the Time when our Saviour appeared, this de&s;tructive <HI>Partiality,</HI> this avowed Con&s;pi|racy again&s;t the common Rights of Man|kind was univer&s;ally prevalent among the mo&s;t civilized Nations. The JEWS were not exempted from this common Exce&s;s. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Inter ip&s;os Fides ob&s;tinata, adver&s;us alios ho&s;tile Odium,</HI>"</Q> was their Character among the Heathens. The <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> committed and boa&s;ted of the mo&s;t cruel Enormities, conquered and in&s;laved inno|cent Nations, plundered Cities, and laid
<PB N="340" REF="352">
wa&s;te Kingdoms, thro' this ab&s;urd and <HI>im|pious Love</HI> of their <HI>Country;</HI> a Principle no better in many of it's Con&s;equences, than the mo&s;t horrid and accur&s;ed <HI>Bigotry.</HI> It had therefore been an e&s;&s;ential Defect, nay rather a mi&s;chievous Ab&s;urdity, in the Chri&s;tian Religion, to have enjoyned, en|couraged, or countenanced a Partiality un|ju&s;t in it&s;elf; to which, from Views of private Advantage, Mankind mu&s;t ever be prone; and which, at the Time when Chri&s;tianity began to &s;pread, was indeed the reigning and <HI>predominant Error.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if by <Q REND="inline">"Zeal for the Publick and Love of our Country"</Q> be meant, &s;uch a Regard to it's Welfare as &s;hall induce us to &s;acrifice every View of private Intere&s;t for it's Accompli&s;hment, yet &s;till <HI>in Subordi|nation</HI> to the <HI>greater Law</HI> of <HI>univer&s;al Ju&s;tice,</HI> this is naturally, nay nece&s;&s;arily in|volved in the Law of <HI>univer&s;al Charity.</HI> The noble Writer indeed affirms, <Q REND="inline">"it is no e&s;&s;en|tial Part of the Chri&s;tian's Charity."</Q> On the contrary it is a <HI>chief Part</HI> of the Chri&s;|tian's Charity. It comes nobly recommend|ed by the Examples of JESUS and St PAUL: The one wept over the approaching De&s;o|lation of his Country: The other declared
<PB N="341" REF="353">
his Willingne&s;s to be cut off from the Chri&s;|tian Community, if by this Means he might &s;ave his Countrymen. And that it nece&s;&s;a|rily ari&s;eth from the Principle of univer&s;al Love will be evident, if we con&s;ider the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Situation</HI> of <HI>Man.</HI> His <HI>Nature</HI> is &s;uch, that he inevitably contracts the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> Affection for tho&s;e with whom he conver&s;eth mo&s;t <HI>intimately;</HI> and who&s;e <HI>Man|ners</HI> and <HI>Relations, civil</HI> and <HI>religious,</HI> are mo&s;t nearly connected with <HI>his own.</HI> His <HI>Situa|tion</HI> is &s;uch, that he &s;eldom hath an Oppor|tunity of doing good Offices to any Society of Men, &s;ave only tho&s;e of his <HI>own Country;</HI> all others being naturally removed beyond the narrow Sphere of private Beneficence. Hence the great Precept of univer&s;al Charity doth e&s;&s;entially involve <Q REND="inline">"a Zeal for the Publick and Love of our Country:"</Q> At once it <HI>curbs</HI> the <HI>Exorbitance</HI> of this natu|ral Partiality, and <HI>carries</HI> it to it's full <HI>Per|fection.</HI></P>
<P>THE Nece&s;&s;ity of this great <HI>Regulating</HI> Principle will further appear, if we con&s;i|der, that with Regard to the Conduct of &s;eparate States and Kingdoms towards each other, no Sanctions of human Law can ever take place. In this re&s;pect all Nations mu&s;t ever be in a State of Nature. There was
<PB N="342" REF="354">
therefore a more particular Nece&s;&s;ity, on this Account, of regulating their Conduct towards each other, by the great Law of <HI>univer&s;al Charity.</HI></P>
<P>IT may &s;eem &s;trange that the noble Writer &s;hould be ignorant of the&s;e Truths.

<P>THERE is another Pa&s;&s;age (<HI>Mi&s;c.</HI> v. c. 1.) which di&s;covers &s;omewhat of unfair dealing in the noble Writer.

<P>THE fir&s;t <HI>Head</HI> therefore, he tells us, is <Q REND="inline">"to make it appear, that Wit and Humour are corroborative of Religion and promo|tive of true Faith."</Q> To this Purpo&s;e he tires us with a Story, not the mo&s;t elegant|ly plann'd, in my Apprehen&s;ion, of a <Q REND="inline">"Club of <HI>merry</HI> Gentlemen, who in a travelling Expedition meeting with &s;orry Roads and
<PB N="354" REF="366">
wor&s;e Fare, laugh'd them&s;elves into a Belief, that both Roads, Accommodations, and Cookery, were perfectly good."</Q> What follows is the Moral or Application of this curious Conceit. <Q REND="inline">"Had I to deal with a malicious Reader, he might per|haps pretend to infer from this Story of my travelling Friends, that I intended to repre&s;ent it as an ea&s;y Matter for Peo|ple to per&s;uade them&s;elves into what Opinion or Belief they plea&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P>NOW without troubling our&s;elves to en|quire how far this Story is a Proof of the noble Writer's fundamental Maxim, <Q REND="inline">"That Ridicule is a Te&s;t of Truth;"</Q> let us pro|ceed to the intended <HI>Moral;</HI> which &s;eems evidently calculated to throw a fal&s;e Light on <HI>religious Belief;</HI> by repre&s;enting it as the mere Effect of <HI>Prejudice, Self-Impo&s;ition,</HI> and <HI>Deceit.</HI> To re&s;cue it, therefore, from this in&s;inuated Calumny, we need not <HI>deny,</HI> but <HI>in&s;i&s;t,</HI> that the Pa&s;&s;ions, fal&s;e Intere&s;ts, and Prejudices of Mankind mu&s;t indeed for ever hang as a Bya&s;s upon their Opinions. But it mu&s;t be farther ob&s;erved too, that the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions and fal&s;e Intere&s;ts will at lea&s;t as often prejudice them <HI>again&s;t</HI> Religion, as <HI>in its Favour.</HI> 'Tis true, there are Preju|dices
<PB N="355" REF="367">
in Favour of Religion, ari&s;ing from <HI>Education;</HI> but there are Prejudices again&s;t it too, ari&s;ing from <HI>vicious Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> Some are <HI>&s;anguine</HI> in their <HI>Hopes,</HI> and hence, while their Conduct is virtuous, <HI>wi&s;h,</HI> and therefore <HI>believe</HI> Religion to be <HI>true:</HI> O|thers are <HI>&s;anguine</HI> in their <HI>Hopes,</HI> but <HI>aban|doned</HI> in their Conduct, and therefore <HI>live</HI> them&s;elves into a Belief that Religon is <HI>fal&s;e.</HI> Some, thro' a Dread of Annihilation, per|&s;uade them&s;elves beyond the Strength of Evidence: Others, thro' the Prevalence of a &s;u&s;picious ca&s;t of Mind, reject even what is probable. Thus Pa&s;&s;ions and Prejudices work powerfully indeed; but they work both <HI>for</HI> and <HI>again&s;t Religion.</HI> It &s;hould &s;eem then, that the noble Writer's Moral, which he aims at <HI>Religion,</HI> may with equal Force be apply'd to <HI>Infidelity:</HI> For it is but &s;uppo&s;ing a Man given up to <HI>Vanity</HI> or <HI>Vice,</HI> and we &s;hall &s;oon <Q REND="inline">"&s;ee him enter into &s;uch a Plot as this again&s;t his own Under|&s;tanding, and endeavour by all po&s;&s;ible Means to per&s;uade both him&s;elf and o|thers of what he thinks <HI>convenient</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful</HI> to DISBELIEVE."</Q> 'Tis idle there|fore to in&s;i&s;t on the Prejudices either <HI>for</HI> or <HI>again&s;t</HI> Religion: they will both naturally
<PB N="356" REF="368">
ari&s;e; and it is the Part of Rea&s;on to con|troul them. But we may &s;afely leave it to any one's Determination, which Temper of Mind is the mo&s;t <HI>amiable,</HI> that which en|tertains Prejudices <HI>in Favour</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> or <HI>again&s;t it.</HI></P>
<P>THE noble Writer proceeds to his <HI>&s;econd</HI> Head; but &s;eems at the &s;ame time con&s;ci|ous how little it was to any good Purpo&s;e. However, in Failure of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Method,</HI> he again hath recour&s;e to what he &s;eems to think <HI>Wit and Humour;</HI> and which, for aught I know, may pa&s;s for &s;uch among his Admirers. <Q REND="inline">"However, &s;ays he, le&s;t I &s;hould be charged for being wor&s;e than my Word, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;atisfy my Reader, by pur&s;uing my Method pro|po&s;ed; if peradventure he can call to Mind what that Method was. Or if he cannot, the Matter is not &s;o very impor|tant, but that he may &s;afely pur&s;ue his Reading, without further Trouble."</Q></P>
<P>BUT tho' it was prudently done in the noble Writer, to throw the Subject of his <HI>&s;econd</HI> Head into <HI>Shades;</HI> yet for the Sake of Truth, we mu&s;t drag it into <HI>Light.</HI> It was therefore to prove <Q REND="inline">"That <HI>Wit and Hu|mour</HI> are u&s;ed as the proper Means of

promoting true Faith, by the holy Foun|ders of Religion."</Q> But when we come to the Point, for <HI>Wit and Humour,</HI> by Vir|tue of a certain Dexterity of Hand, the Reader is again unexpectedly pre&s;ented with <HI>good Humour</HI> in their Stead. This, it will be &s;aid, is nimble dealing; but what of that, &s;o long as it may tend to di&s;grace <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> and its <HI>Founder?</HI> The noble Writer's Application, therefore, is &s;till more Extraordinary. <Q REND="inline">"The Affection and Love which procures a true Adherence to the new religious Foundation, mu&s;t depend either on a real or <HI>counterfeit Goodne&s;s</HI> in the <HI>religious Founder:</HI> Whatever <HI>ambitious Spirit</HI> may <HI>in&s;pire him;</HI> whatever <HI>&s;avage Zeal</HI> or <HI>per&s;ecuting Principle</HI> may lie <HI>in Re&s;erve,</HI> roady to di&s;clo&s;e it&s;elf when Au|thority and Power is once obtained; the <HI>fir&s;t Scene</HI> of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> however, fails not to pre&s;ent us with the agreeable Views of <HI>Joy, Love, Meakne&s;s, Gentlene&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Moderation.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;To &s;peak my inmo&s;t Sen|timents of this Pa&s;&s;age, it is of too black a Nature to de&s;erve a Reply. There are certain Degrees of <HI>Calumny</HI> &s;o <HI>flagrant,</HI> as injured Truth di&s;dains to an&s;wer; and this is of the Kind. On this Occa&s;ion, there|fore,
<PB N="358" REF="370">
we &s;hall leave the noble Writer to the Reflections of every <HI>hone&s;t Man;</HI> in Con|formity to the Example of that ble&s;&s;ed Per|&s;on, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>who, when he was reviled, reviled not again</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above &sect; 3. of this <HI>E&s;&s;ay.</HI> p. 269.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>THE next Circum&s;tance in holy Writ, that falls under his Lord&s;hip's Animadver|&s;ion, is what he calls <Q REND="inline">"The famous <HI>Entry</HI> or <HI>high Dance</HI> perform'd by DAVID in the Proce&s;&s;ion of the &s;acred Coffer."</Q> In which he hath again repre&s;ented Things <HI>as it &s;eemed good to him.</HI> Here, by confound|ing <HI>ancient,</HI> with <HI>modern Manners</HI> (in &s;uch a Way as is quite unworthy of his Charac|ter, and &s;uited only to the Genius of a <HI>Coffee-hou&s;e</HI> Freethinker) he hath endeavour|ed to bring down the <HI>&s;olemn Proce&s;&s;ion</HI> of a grand <HI>religious Fe&s;tival,</HI> to a Level with the Merriments of an Api&s;h <HI>Dancing-Ma&s;ter.</HI> This Repre&s;entation may very probably pa&s;s current among many of his Admirers; &s;o that it had been nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et the Mat|ter in its true Light; but that here too, I am happily prevented by a judicious Wri|ter, who hath done all imaginable Ju&s;tice to the Argument; and effectually ex|po&s;ed

<P>HIS Lord&s;hip now proceeds to the Story of the Prophet JONAH, which he hath bur|le&s;qued and turned to Farce with that De|licacy, &s;o peculiar to him&s;elf. The Story it&s;elf is indeed authenticated by our SAVI|OUR's mention of it, as emblematical of his own Death and Re&s;urrection. Its Moral is excellent; being an illu&s;trious Di&s;play of the divine Mercy to penitent and returning Sinners, exemplify'd in GOD's remitting the Puni&s;hment denounced, and &s;paring a de|voted City on its &s;incere Repentance; as al|&s;o of the Frailty and Imperfection of the be&s;t of Men, &s;et forth in the Prophet's Be|haviour on the Occa&s;ion. To this we may add <Q REND="inline">"the Propriety of the Miracle record|ed,"</Q> which was it&s;elf an extraordinary and mo&s;t awakening <Q REND="inline">"In&s;tance of Puni&s;hment <HI>inflicted on Di&s;obedience,</HI> and <HI>remitted on Repentance;</HI>"</Q> and therefore bearing a <HI>&s;trong Relation</HI> to the <HI>Event</HI> for which it was wrought; being peculiarly <HI>adapted,</HI> when made known to the <HI>Ninevites,</HI> to in|duce
<PB N="360" REF="372">
them to hearken to the Prophet's Preaching, to <HI>believe</HI> what he <HI>denounced</HI> and <HI>promi&s;ed,</HI> and rouze them at once into a <HI>Fear</HI> of GOD's <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> and a <HI>Reliance</HI> on his <HI>Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH then being the real Nature of the Fact; the Secret of the noble Writer's po|lite Repre&s;entation lies in his burle&s;quing the Circum&s;tances of the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed Dialogue</HI> between GOD and the Prophet; an ea&s;y Ta&s;k for any one who is di&s;ingenuous or ignorant enough to repre&s;ent as &s;trictly <HI>litteral,</HI> what is evidently <HI>parabolical;</HI> ac|cording to the frequent and known Manner of <HI>Compo&s;ition</HI> in the earlie&s;t Ages<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See the <HI>Div.

<P>THE next, and only remaining Circum|&s;tance worthy of Notice in this Mi&s;cellany, is a <HI>pretended Tran&s;lation</HI> from PLUTARCH: In which the noble Writer deals as honour|ably by that Author, as before by GORGIAS or ARISTOTLE<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See above, <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> i. &sect; ix.</BIBL></NOTE>.

<P>BUT with Re&s;pect to Language the Af|fair is otherwi&s;e: It's <HI>Ends</HI> are <HI>various.</HI> From the Four different Kinds of literary Compo&s;ition, as explained above<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See <HI>E&s;&s;ay,</HI> i. &sect; 3.</BIBL></NOTE>, there mu&s;t ari&s;e a corre&s;pondent Variety of Style, the <HI>Poetical,</HI> the <HI>Oratorial,</HI> the <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI> and <HI>Didactic.</HI> The Fir&s;t of the&s;e Kinds alone partakes of the Nature of <HI>Picture,</HI> and therefore can alone be properly compared with it; as they are both referr'd to the <HI>Imagination,</HI> for the End of <HI>Plea&s;ure:</HI> The other three Species of Compo&s;ition, tend|ing chiefly to <HI>Utility,</HI> by the Means of <HI>Per&s;ua&s;ion</HI> or <HI>In&s;truction,</HI> draw their prime Value from <HI>Plainne&s;s, Clearne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Pre|ci&s;ion:</HI>

From being adapted, not to the <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> of the <HI>fa&s;tidious Critic,</HI> but to the <HI>Ca|pacities</HI> of tho&s;e who are the intended Ob|jects of <HI>Per&s;wa&s;ion</HI> or <HI>In&s;truction.</HI> Here then, the noble Writer's Parallel is e&s;&s;enti|ally defective: Since it was the Intention of <HI>Providence,</HI> in the &s;acred Scriptures, to conde&s;cend to what his Lord&s;hip's Quality and refined Wi&s;dom intitle him to di&s;dain, even <HI>to in&s;truct the mere Vulgar:</HI> Whereas the End of <HI>Painting,</HI> is only <HI>the Amu&s;ement of the Few.</HI></P>
<P>IN Regard to the <HI>Execution,</HI> we &s;hall find as wide a Difference.

followed. Hence <HI>Gracefulne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Strength</HI> of Style, <HI>Harmony</HI> or <HI>Softne&s;s, copious</HI> Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, <HI>ter&s;e</HI> Brevity, or <HI>contra&s;ted</HI> Peri|ods, have by turns gained the Approbation of particular Countries. Now all the&s;e <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> Beauties of Speech are <HI>relative, lo|cal,</HI> and <HI>capricious;</HI> and con&s;equently un|worthy the Imitation of a divine Arti&s;t; who, to fit the Speech he <HI>ordains,</HI> to the great Work of <HI>univer&s;al In&s;truction,</HI> would, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, &s;trip it of eve|ry <HI>local, peculiar,</HI> and <HI>grote&s;que</HI> Ornament; and convey it unaccompany'd by all, but the more <HI>univer&s;al</HI> Qualities common to eve|ry Tongue.</P>
<P>THE noble Writer, then, might with &s;ome &s;hew of Rea&s;on have objected to the <HI>Style</HI> of Scripture, had the Writers boa&s;t|ed it's <HI>Elegance,</HI> as MAHOMET did that of his <HI>Koran,</HI> and defy'd all his Oppo&s;ers to write any thing approaching it in this Re|&s;pect.

THO' this Scrutiny alone might be &s;uffi|cient to detect and di&s;credit the Wantonne&s;s of the noble Writer's Compari&s;on; yet it will further lead us to a full Di&s;clo&s;ure of the Truth; by &s;hewing <HI>that</HI> to be the peculiar Characteri&s;tic of the Scripture <HI>Compo&s;ition,</HI> which hath ever held the fir&s;t Rank among the Qualities of human Writings; I mean, that of <HI>unadorned</HI> SIMPLICITY.</P>

AS it appears from the&s;e In&s;tances, that <HI>Simplicity</HI> is the only univer&s;al Characteri|&s;tic of ju&s;t Writing; &s;o the &s;uperior Emi|nence of the &s;acred Scriptures in this prime Quality hath been generally acknowledged.

<P><PB N="385" REF="397">
BUT we need not have Recour&s;e to Au|thorities, for the Proof of the &s;uperior Weight and Dignity of the &s;acred Scrip|tures, in this great Quality.

Hence the <HI>Bible-Compo&s;ition</HI> pre&s;erves its native Beauty and Strength,
<PB N="386" REF="398">
alike in every Language, by the &s;ole Ener|gy of unadorned Phra&s;e, natural Images, weight of Sentiment, and <HI>great Simpli|city.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS in this Re&s;pect, like a rich Vein of <HI>Gold,</HI> which, under the &s;evere&s;t Trials of Heat, Cold, and Moi&s;ture, retains its origi|nal <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Splendor,</HI> without either Lo&s;s or Alloy; while ba&s;er Metals are corrupted by Earth, Air, Water, Fire, and a&s;&s;imilated to the various Elements thro' which they pa&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS Circum&s;tance then may be ju&s;tly regarded as &s;ufficient to vindicate the Com|po&s;ition of the &s;acred Scriptures; as it is at once their chief <HI>Excellence,</HI> and greate&s;t <HI>Se|curity.</HI> 'Tis their <HI>Excellence,</HI> as it renders them <HI>intelligible</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful to all;</HI> 'tis their <HI>Security,</HI> as it prevents their being di&s;gui&s;ed by the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>capricious</HI> Ornaments of <HI>vain</HI> or <HI>weak Tran&s;lators.</HI></P>
<P>WE may &s;afely appeal to Experience and Fact for the Confirmation of the&s;e Remarks on the &s;uperior Simplicity, Utility, and Ex|cellence of the Style of holy Scripture. Is there any Book in the World, &s;o perfect|ly adapted to all Capacities? that contains &s;uch <HI>&s;ublime</HI> and <HI>exalting</HI> Precepts, convey'd
<PB N="387" REF="399">
in &s;uch an <HI>artle&s;s</HI> and <HI>intelligible</HI> Strain? that can be read with &s;uch Plea&s;ure and Advan|tage, by the lettered <HI>Sage</HI> and the unlettered <HI>Pea&s;ant?</HI> To whom then would the noble Writer &s;end Mankind for religious and mo|ral In&s;truction? To the divine PLATO, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed; or, more probably, to the <HI>inraptured</HI> Strains of PHILOCLES and THE|OCLES. And &s;ure, Mankind mu&s;t reap much In&s;truction and Advantage from the <HI>puffed Epithets</HI> and <HI>&s;u&s;tian Style</HI> of a <HI>philo&s;o|phical Romance.</HI> We may rea&s;onably hope indeed, &s;oon to &s;ee (nay, do we not already &s;ee?) the happy Effects of this high Di&s;ci|pline.

<P>TO return then to the noble Writer's Compari&s;on (if indeed we have departed from it) the&s;e united Ob&s;ervations may con|vince us, that the only circum&s;tance in Painting, which can with any Propriety be compared to literary <HI>Style,</HI> is that of
<PB N="388" REF="400">
<HI>colouring.</HI> And on this principle we may farther confirm all that hath been &s;aid on the &s;uperior Excellence of the <HI>&s;imple</HI> Man|ner. For 'tis well known, and the noble Writer knew it, that while the Ma&s;ters in this fine Art confined the Pencil to the ge|nuine Forms of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Greatne&s;s,</HI> and only &s;uperadded to the&s;e the temperate Em|belli&s;hments of a <HI>cha&s;ti&s;ed</HI> and <HI>mode&s;t</HI> co|louring, the Art grew towards its <HI>Perfec|tion:</HI> but no &s;ooner was their Attention turned from <HI>Truth, Simplicity,</HI> and <HI>De&s;ign,</HI> to the gaudy Decorations of a rich and lu&s;cious <HI>Colouring,</HI> than their Credit de|clined with their Art: and the experienced Eye, which contemplates the <HI>old</HI> Pictures with <HI>Admiration,</HI> &s;urveys the <HI>modern</HI> with Indifference or <HI>Contempt.</HI></P>
<P>TO conclude. We &s;ee there are two Kinds of <HI>Compo&s;ition,</HI> e&s;&s;entially oppo&s;ed to each other. The <HI>one</HI> turns the Atten|tion on <HI>it&s;elf;</HI> the <HI>other,</HI> on <HI>the Truths it conveys.</HI> The fir&s;t may be ju&s;tly compared to a <HI>Sun-Beam playing</HI> on the <HI>Surface</HI> of the Water, which <HI>attracts</HI> and <HI>dazzles</HI> the Beholder's Eye by its own <HI>u&s;ele&s;s Splendor.</HI> The la&s;t is like a <HI>Sun-Beam</HI> darting to the Bottom; which, while it&s;elf is <HI>un&s;een,</HI> or
<PB N="389" REF="401">
<HI>unob&s;erved, communicates</HI> its brightne&s;s, and <HI>illumines every Object on which it falls.</HI></P>
<P>HOW far the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e may belong to to the noble Writer, let others determine. 'Tis &s;ufficient to have proved, that the <HI>la&s;t</HI> is the <HI>unvaried</HI> Style and Manner of the <HI>&s;acred Scriptures.</HI></P>
