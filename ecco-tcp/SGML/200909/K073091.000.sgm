<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>A Great part of the <HI>mi&s;takes</HI> about Religion have ari&s;en from men's pa&s;&s;ing <HI>too &s;uddenly</HI> from one object to another. Mankind naturally are di&s;|po&s;ed to proceed rapidly in their progre&s;s after truth: and &s;eldom come to the true knowledge of it, by rea&s;on of not con&s;idering <HI>one thing before another.</HI> The words of <HI>Job</HI> may be fitly applied to mankind in general;&mdash;<Q>For vain man would be wi&s;e, though man is born like a wild a&s;&s;es colt, <BIBL><HI>Job</HI> xi. 12.</BIBL></Q> Notwith&s;tanding we are <HI>dull</HI> in our capacities in learning the knowledge of <HI>truth,</HI> yet we are <HI>ever</HI> ready to make too <HI>much</HI> ha&s;te, and to &s;tretch our&s;elves beyond our mea&s;ure.&mdash;Pa&s;&s;ing too quickly from <HI>one</HI> thing to <HI>another,</HI> we leave the former before we inve&s;tigate <HI>its</HI> properties.
<Q>In &s;eeking to become wi&s;e, we become fools,</Q> by &s;topping &s;hort in our enquiries be|fore we under&s;tand <HI>any</HI> &s;ubject. Wi&s;dom is not attained by the ordinary methods of &s;eeking after her.&mdash;We &s;hould "&s;earch for her as for hid trea&s;ure." We ought not to leave <HI>any</HI> truth before we have examined <HI>it</HI> on <HI>all &s;ides,</HI> and enquired into its various properties, on purpo&s;e to under&s;tand the <HI>whole complex</HI> or <HI>particular notions</HI> included in <HI>its</HI> general character:&mdash;How far <HI>it</HI> may be po&s;&s;ible to know the &s;everal &s;imple properties which are under&s;tood in <HI>general terms,</HI> or <HI>univer&s;al propo&s;itions.</HI></P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary if we would under&s;tand things as they are in their &s;everal con&s;titutions, <HI>phy&s;ical, moral,</HI> and <HI>oeco|nomical,</HI> to examine the con&s;titutions in which they are con&s;idered as <HI>parts</HI> of a <HI>whole.</HI> By this means we &s;hall be led to con&s;ider the various relations which con&s;titution|al ideas have to one another:&mdash;Which may be of <HI>&s;ingular &s;ervice</HI> to us in the chu&s;ing terms to expre&s;s either general or particular things. By this means we &s;hall proceed <HI>gradually</HI> from <HI>one</HI> property of <HI>any</HI> &s;ubject to another, and be able to di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>primary</HI> and <HI>&s;econdary truths,</HI> and their qualities:&mdash;And know what we are already in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; and what we ought to enquire after, on purpo&s;e to <HI>con&s;ummate our knowledge.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3">IT is a great part of our pre&s;ent infelicity that we think we have knowledge when we have <HI>&s;ome perceptions;</HI>&mdash; whereas perceptions are but the materials of knowledge, or the &s;teps by which we advance to under&s;tanding. It is nece&s;&s;ary that we judge our perceptions, and compare them with <HI>tho&s;e objects</HI> which we think we perceive, other|wi&s;e what we call knowledge will be no more than a <HI>chaos</HI> of <HI>ill arranged perceptions, huddled together without any order.</HI></P>
<P>ONE <HI>chief</HI> thing to be ob&s;erved in all our pur&s;uits after truth is <HI>Analy&s;is.</HI> The Almighty has &s;een meet to repre|&s;ent <HI>Truth</HI> to men <HI>as it were in bundles,</HI> and when they are well directed in their enquiries after <HI>it,</HI> they proceed by <HI>Analy&s;is</HI> to find out the &s;everal &s;imples contained in <HI>every concert.</HI> But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve <HI>here,</HI> that we know <HI>nothing</HI> of ab&s;olute &s;implicity: Things to us are only &s;imple by being compared with other things that are more complex; but we cannot &s;ay that we know <HI>any</HI> thing ab&s;tractly in a perfect &s;en&s;e. Our notions of &s;implicity are <HI>entirely</HI> form|ed from our notions of compo&s;ition;&mdash;and we call things &s;imple that are <HI>farthe&s;t</HI> from &s;ome known compound. E|very object meets us at <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in a compounded or con&s;titu|tional &s;tate;&mdash;and our knowledge of con&s;titutional truth con&s;i&s;ts in our being acquainted with the <HI>Analy&s;is</HI> of its con&s;titution. The &s;everal individual truths arranged in <HI>&s;uch</HI> a con&s;titution; when con&s;idered di&s;tinct from the re&s;t, are called <HI>&s;imple.</HI>&mdash;This I take to be <HI>all</HI> that is implied in our ideas of &s;implicity. Our notions of &s;implicity are therefore <HI>only</HI> relative.</P>
<P>I &s;hall ob&s;erve before I proceed, that all our knowledge of the Divine Nature and Operations is founded upon a con&s;titution of his government; and we attain to <HI>that</HI> knowledge by being <HI>gradually</HI> let into the <HI>Analy&s;is</HI> of that con&s;titution. By unfolding the <HI>various</HI> parts and <HI>relations, principles</HI> and <HI>ends</HI> of that con&s;titution, the Deity makes <HI>his ways</HI> known to men;&mdash;and the whole &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;i|cal and moral truth, as it relates to <HI>this</HI> con&s;titution, comes to be known by comparing tho&s;e parts and rela|tions. The under&s;tanding of parts and their relations, in
<PB N="iii" REF="4">natural philo&s;ophy, may be called phy&s;ical knowledge; the under&s;tanding of relations and ends, in morals may be called <HI>moral knowledge.</HI> The term relation is truly no more than the condition of &s;ome object with regard to another in &s;ome &s;y&s;tem, either as to connection, or oppo|&s;ition. Relations are all the parts we po&s;&s;ibly can con|ceive of, in a moral &s;y&s;tem, and in <HI>any</HI> moral con&s;titution bear the &s;ame re&s;pect to one another, that parts, <HI>properly &s;o called,</HI> do in <HI>phy&s;ics,</HI> or <HI>natural philo&s;ophy.</HI></P>
<P>GOOD and evil, are to one another as <HI>heavy</HI> and <HI>light,</HI> namely, oppo&s;ites;&mdash;they are equally parts of the &s;y&s;tem they belong to. The term <HI>part</HI> is relative, and has a re&s;pect to a whole, as the term <HI>good</HI> is relative, and has a relation to <HI>evil.</HI> They are only &s;o &s;y&s;tematically, as far as we know; what they are in them&s;elves, we cannot cer|tainly &s;ay. Moral evil &s;uppo&s;eth <HI>&s;ome law</HI> and con&s;titu|tion of government;&mdash;<Q>For where there is no law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</Q> It can therefore be evil <HI>only</HI> &s;y&s;tematically, and cannot be conceived of, <HI>out of a &s;y&s;tem.</HI> The true knowledge of the con&s;titution and &s;y&s;tem we be|long to, with all the various relations and di&s;pen&s;ations thereof, are taught us in <HI>revelation;</HI>&mdash;the right knowledge of the &s;criptures is the true <HI>Analy&s;is</HI> of the divine govern|ment and admini&s;tration.
<Q>Which are profitable for all things to make the man of God perfect, and to furni&s;h him thoroughly for every good word and work, <BIBL>2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 17.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THE plan of the divine government hath <HI>never</HI> varied, though the external admini&s;tration thereof hath been va|rious, at different times, &s;ince the beginning of the world. It argues the infinite capacity of the great author, that he hath &s;upported an uniform plan of government, amid&s;t the <HI>various</HI> di&s;pen&s;ations thereof, among &s;o many different nations and people.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t account we have of the conduct of the Al|mighty towards man is, that he made him after <HI>his own image,</HI> and placed <HI>him</HI> under a <HI>law;</HI>&mdash;which <HI>law</HI> he qua|lified <HI>him</HI> to obey, by endowing <HI>him</HI> with powers &s;uitable to the <HI>ta&s;k</HI> he enjoined <HI>him.</HI> The re&s;t of the creatures
<PB N="iv" REF="5">were made &s;ubject to man, as the <HI>Repre&s;entative</HI> of his <HI>Maker</HI> in this lower world. <HI>Adam,</HI> the fir&s;t of our pro|genitors, was intru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of govern|ment in this world, and was the <HI>vicegerent</HI> of <HI>his Maker</HI> over all the creatures; yet he him&s;elf was put under a <HI>law,</HI> and made <HI>accountable</HI> to the great Legi&s;lator of the univer&s;e. He was God's chief mini&s;ter under this fir&s;t con&s;titution.</P>
<P>GOD, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite pre&s;cience, could not but know what would be the i&s;&s;ue of <HI>Adam</HI>'s admini&s;tration, had therefore provided again&s;t <HI>all future contingencies;</HI> yet &s;aw meet to &s;uffer a &s;pecimen to be handed down through all ages, what the mo&s;t perfect beings were liable to when left entirely to the exerci&s;e of their own liberty. By permitting <HI>Adam</HI> to betray <HI>his tru&s;t,</HI> and &s;uffering him to tran&s;gre&s;s that law he was placed under, <HI>He</HI> has evidently &s;hewn that the mo&s;t perfect human liberty, yea angelic freedom, cannot &s;ecure creatures in happine&s;s, without the divine care and agency to uphold them. All human powers are created, and need as much the concurrence of the power of God to &s;upport them in their exerci&s;es, as it was nece&s;&s;ary for their fir&s;t exi&s;tence: For it is true in a moral as well as a natural &s;en&s;e;
<Q>That in him we live, and move, and have our being, <BIBL><HI>Acts</HI> xvii. 28.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>ADAM being the &s;ubject of his Maker, and his prime mini&s;ter with re&s;pect to the creatures, by breaking that <HI>po&s;itive law</HI> concerning the <HI>fruit</HI> of the forbidden <HI>tree,</HI> lo&s;t his dominion over the creatures, and became liable him&s;elf to &s;uffer puni&s;hment, becau&s;e the law of that con|&s;titution threatened death in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience. It is manife&s;t from &s;cripture, that the fir&s;t man being in a <HI>public</HI> character tran&s;mitted <HI>his guilt</HI> to <HI>his po&s;terity;</HI> for the Apo&s;tle plainly declares,
<Q>That the judgment was by one to condemnation,</Q> and
<Q>that death reigned by one man's offence:</Q> That
<Q>by the offence of one, judg|ment came upon all men to condemnation:</Q> That
<Q>by one man's di&s;obedience, many were made &s;inners, <BIBL><HI>Rom.</HI> v. 16, 17, 18, 19.</BIBL></Q> It is plain from the Apo&s;tle's o|pinion of the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that it brought both <HI>death</HI> and <HI>condemnation</HI> along with it. How this was con&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="v" REF="6">with <HI>that</HI> con&s;titution man <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> was placed in; and how it was ju&s;t in the Almighty to impute the &s;in of <HI>Adam</HI> to his po&s;terity, may <HI>next</HI> fall under our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>HERE we mu&s;t confine our views of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> to what was expre&s;&s;ed in the law of the fir&s;t con&s;titution of man. According to that law, it was ju&s;t for God to puni&s;h man with death and condemnation, becau&s;e his offence was <HI>trea&s;on</HI> again&s;t the divine government, by affecting <HI>inde|pendency.</HI> The offence was aggravated by man attempting to be <HI>like to God,</HI> or rather <HI>independent</HI> upon Him. It was not <HI>merely</HI> a <HI>&s;imple</HI> breach of <HI>tru&s;t,</HI> but an attempt to u&s;urp the throne of the Almighty; it was <HI>more</HI> than di&s;o|bedience of the law that the Almighty gave to <HI>Adam;</HI>&mdash; eating of that fruit <HI>at any rate</HI> might have de&s;erved con|demnation, but to eat thereof to be as God, was &s;eeking to become Deities. As man had now taken part with beings who had already renounced the <HI>Divine &s;upremacy</HI> as far as they could, it was but fit he &s;hould &s;hare in <HI>their</HI> puni&s;hment as far as the offence was <HI>&s;imilar.</HI></P>
<P>WHENEVER <HI>Adam</HI> &s;hould have children, they could not but &s;tand in a relation to him as <HI>a parent under for|feiture</HI> of happine&s;s, till &s;uch time as it &s;hould appear whether they would approve of their father's mi&s;conduct or not:&mdash;For the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of <HI>all laws</HI> &s;aith, that the &s;ons of <HI>traitors</HI> &s;hall not have the inheritance their fathers have forfeited, till once the government hath <HI>&s;ome proof</HI> of their fidelity. The imputation of the guilt of fathers to their children is implied in the <HI>&s;pirit of all laws,</HI> and interwoven with <HI>all forms</HI> of wi&s;e government. But in ca&s;e &s;ons &s;hall di&s;approve of their fathers conduct, and approve them|&s;elves worthy of the notice of the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> it is <HI>but rea|&s;onable</HI> that they be taken under his protection, and have the forfeiture removed which their parent brought upon their inheritance.&mdash;But this is far from being the ca&s;e with the &s;eed of <HI>Adam.</HI> They became partakers of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> rebellious temper of mind that was in him, and di&s;cover it as &s;oon as they are able to do any thing.</P>
<P>NOT to carry this point too far, it was and is <HI>ju&s;t</HI> in our Great Sovereign to impute the guilt of <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;in to
<PB N="vi" REF="7">all his po&s;terity, till <HI>they</HI> di&s;approve of his deed, and te&s;tify their di&s;like of it, by conformity to that law which he tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. But &s;hall none of <HI>his race</HI> di&s;approve of <HI>his conduct,</HI> but walk in <HI>his very foot&s;teps,</HI> what does the &s;pirit of all good laws &s;ay, but that, the children &s;hall &s;uffer even for the &s;in of their fathers, and their own al&s;o? I hear|tily agree with what the Prophet &s;ays:
<Q>If a father beget a &s;on that &s;eeth all his father's &s;ins which he hath done, and con&s;idereth and doth not &s;uch like. If he walk in the &s;tatutes of life without committing iniquity: he &s;hall &s;urely live, he &s;hall not die. He &s;hall not bear the iniquity of his father, <BIBL><HI>Ezek.</HI> xviii. 14. and xxxiii. 15.</BIBL></Q> But where do we find among all the &s;ons of <HI>Adam</HI> &s;uch wi&s;e and con&s;iderate children? Do not they
<Q>all go a&s;tray as &s;oon as they are born, and are e&s;tranged from the very womb?</Q> The &s;cripture account of all men as de&s;cendants of <HI>Adam</HI> is;
<Q>There is none righteous, no not one; there is none that under&s;tandeth, there is none that &s;eeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one, <BIBL><HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 10, 11, 12.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>ADAM and all his po&s;terity were now <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> accounted <HI>guilty</HI> by the law of their con&s;titution they were fir&s;t placed in, both on account of the promi&s;e they de&s;pi&s;ed, and the authority of God they &s;et at nought. It would border upon profanity to &s;ay, that the Almighty placed man under a <HI>faulty</HI> con&s;titution; for it &s;eems to have been as well calculated for free agents, that are <HI>dependent,</HI> as any thing could be to an&s;wer an end. The mo&s;t mate|rial objection that &s;eem to have <HI>any</HI> weight in <HI>it,</HI> is at the &s;ame time <HI>full of impiety,</HI> namely, that God ought to have prevented what he knew would &s;o much tend to the <HI>hurt</HI> of his rational creatures.&mdash;But not to mention the <HI>ab&s;urdity</HI> of &s;aying what the Almighty <HI>ought</HI> to have done, we &s;hould rather conceive that God did things for the <HI>be&s;t;</HI>&mdash;and more e&s;pecially, as it was through an abu&s;e of the <HI>be&s;t</HI> of <HI>privileges,</HI> that man ruined <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> Liberty is what all wi&s;e men account a valuable privilege, and it is nece&s;&s;ary to make rational creatures <HI>accountable;</HI> and had man at fir&s;t not been formed a free agent, as far as a crea|ture
<PB N="vii" REF="8">can be <HI>dependently free,</HI> he could neither had <HI>merit,</HI> nor <HI>demerit.</HI> It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that God made man upright, and neither impelled him to the one &s;ide or the other; and as he had power to do good or evil, he is <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> accountable for the abu&s;e of <HI>his liberty. The only &s;ource of moral obligation is the divine will;</HI> and &s;eeing God decla|red, that it was his plea&s;ure that man &s;hould ab&s;tain from <HI>the fruit of the forbidden tree,</HI> it was an act of the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> rebellion again&s;t God, to gain&s;ay his public declaration. Man was therefore condemned for a <HI>breach</HI> of moral obli|gation, attended with the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> aggravations.</P>
<P>IT would be needle&s;s to &s;ay what man lo&s;t through his di&s;obedience;&mdash;the favour of his Maker, which is life, and every other ble&s;&s;ing that tends to happine&s;s he forfeit|ed, <HI>by &s;inning again&s;t God.</HI> It would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that man could <HI>really</HI> enjoy <HI>life,</HI> when he had lo&s;t the <HI>favour</HI> of his Maker, in which <HI>it</HI> con&s;i&s;ted;&mdash;what is therefore meant by death in the <HI>full</HI> extent of the word, under this con&s;titution, is <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> and <HI>pain,</HI> as well as the <HI>di&s;&s;olution</HI> of the body <HI>through mortality.</HI> The fabric of this fir&s;t con&s;ti|tution was <HI>totally</HI> ruined, as far as it re&s;pected human happine&s;s; and the weight of its fall would have &s;unk the whole human race down to <HI>endle&s;s</HI> mi&s;ery, had not the Almighty, who knew all future events <HI>before-hand,</HI> pro|vided a remedy &s;uitable to the breach made in that con|&s;titution. This law, which man was made under, &s;tood in <HI>full force</HI> again&s;t <HI>him,</HI> and as it was the fir&s;t public re|velation of God's will, to which <HI>he</HI> had annexed a threaten|ing, where <HI>his veracity</HI> was concerned; for the &s;ake of his public credit, as the ju&s;t governor of the univer&s;e, he deals with all men according to this <HI>fir&s;t</HI> revelation of his will. This <HI>Law, Covenant, Revelation,</HI> or what you plea&s;e to call it, comes always <HI>fir&s;t</HI> under con&s;ideration when the Almighty deals with men.</P>
<P>As this is really the ca&s;e, that the Almighty begins with every man of <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity, where their father ended, and is obliged <HI>in honour</HI> to do &s;o, it appears <HI>plainly,</HI> that
<Q>by the deeds of the law no fle&s;h living can be ju&s;tified.</Q> The Almighty cannot, <HI>in character,</HI> depart from the fir&s;t publication of his will, and men cannot
<PB N="viii" REF="9">walk up to <HI>it &s;ince Adam fell,</HI> but fall mi&s;erably &s;hort in <HI>Principles, Mea&s;ure, Motives,</HI> and <HI>Ends:</HI>&mdash;The con&s;equence is, they mu&s;t either be mi&s;erable, or <HI>&s;ome other &s;cheme</HI> mu&s;t be revealed, &s;uited to the character of God, and the mi&s;erable condition of mankind. The condition of man|kind is very wretched through &s;in:&mdash;They are in con|&s;equence of the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>equity</HI> of God, as a <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed in <HI>that law</HI> given to man at fir&s;t, con&s;igned over to <HI>death</HI> and <HI>condemnation;</HI>&mdash;they are held fa&s;t by the fetters of prejudice and corrupt affections, and have neither <HI>will</HI> nor <HI>inclination</HI> to do the will of God. Hence they are <HI>doubly</HI> in bondage;&mdash;bound over to condemna|tion, by the &s;anction of the law of God;&mdash;and bound by their own corrupt affections as <HI>&s;laves</HI> to the <HI>God of this world.</HI> Whatever different <HI>Theories</HI> men may have of this matter, every man, <HI>in fact,</HI> feels the truth of this double bondage;&mdash;which they plainly di&s;cover by fears at death, and enmity to truth while they live.</P>
<P>SUCH is the &s;tate and condition of man, that without a <HI>Redeemer</HI> he can have <HI>no</HI> hope of happine&s;s, nor <HI>any</HI> real plea&s;ure in this life.&mdash;<HI>Redemption</HI> by <HI>the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>give hope</HI> of happine&s;s to men: And <HI>this</HI> &s;hall now be con&s;idered.</P>

<P>WHENEVER God intended to expre&s;s his mercy and compa&s;&s;ion towards mi&s;erable mortals, it was nece&s;&s;ary that his wi&s;dom &s;hould devi&s;e a method, whereby mercy and compa&s;&s;ion might appear con&s;i&s;tent with the truth of the divine threatening, and the purity of the holy law. We find from &s;cripture, that benevolence and wi&s;dom are both con&s;picuous in the plan of man's happine&s;s; Wi&s;dom, in contriving a &s;cheme where there is the <HI>Greate&s;t</HI> good|will to men, and yet the divine law taken fir&s;t into con&s;i|deration; Benevolence, in taking into con&s;ideration the ca&s;e of <HI>enemies, wretched,</HI> and <HI>mi&s;erable,</HI> and conferring favours upon them, they never could have de&s;erved.

<Q>When &s;acrifice and offerings were not required,</Q> JEHOVAH, the Me&s;&s;iah, &s;ays;
<Q>a body ha&s;t thou prepared me, I de|light to do thy will, O my God,&mdash;thy law I have within my heart.</Q> Chri&s;t was made under the very <HI>&s;ame law</HI> which the fir&s;t man tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed.

<P>THE <HI>chief end</HI> of man was to <HI>glorify God,</HI> by doing <HI>his will,</HI> and CHRIST had a <HI>&s;pecial</HI> re&s;pect to this end;&mdash; "I delight to do thy will."

<P>THIS Redemption was a procuring of that inheritance which man lo&s;t. Man's portion and inheritance, where|by he could have lived happy, and enjoyed life, was the favour and fellow&s;hip of his Maker:&mdash;This enjoyment he forfeited by breaking the divine law, and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the holy commandment.&mdash;Man was driven from his in|heritance, and became a vagabond upon the earth, for re|nouncing his allegiance to the Almighty. He had no|thing after he had &s;inned that he could call his own, but what he would have been better without; namely, the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, threatened in the &s;anction of the law of works:&mdash;And be&s;ides, he was mi&s;erable by what he had lo&s;t. All enjoyments what&s;oever, unle&s;s connected with the divine favour, tend only to make the cur&s;e &s;it fa&s;ter upon guilty minds. It is only in the favour of God there is life; all other vital acts are only the &s;hadow of life:&mdash;For without the favour of God a man is dead while he liveth. When God created man at fir&s;t, he made him lord of this lower world, and heir of everla&s;ting felicity in the next, upon condition, that he &s;hould obey that law which he gave him, as the te&s;t of his dependence upon him; and his acknowledgment of his Maker's &s;o|vereignty. His faithful &s;ervice for a &s;ea&s;on, would have entitled him to a crown of immortal life;&mdash;but he &s;old him&s;elf to Satan, for the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, and lo&s;t his liberty by gratifying his ta&s;te.
<Q>By &s;eeking to become
<PB N="22" REF="23">wi&s;e, he became a fool,</Q> and marred his happine&s;s, by &s;tretching its limits beyond the divine prohibition. By giving him&s;elf up to be the &s;ervant of &s;in and Satan, God, in righteous judgment, condemned him to be their &s;laves; and in&s;tead of that ble&s;&s;ed inheritance of immortal life, he had rea&s;on, as the &s;on of God, to expect, if he had con|tinued in his &s;ervice, he was made a &s;lave to the devil, and a &s;ubject of death. Through pride and &s;eduction he lo&s;t an inheritance which would have for ever enriched both him and his po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Now, man is mi&s;erable for wanting what only can make him happy, and is not able to pay a ran&s;om for what he hath lo&s;t. But God, who is abundant in love, and infinite in mercy, &s;ent his &s;on in human nature,&mdash;who hath given his life's blood to redeem the lo&s;t inheritance. The &s;trong One, JEHOVAH's partner, the Man, his Fel|low, or of his Right Hand, was &s;ent to redeem that fore|feited inheritance, that his "little ones might not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life." This holy life and obedience, which we call active, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from his pa&s;&s;ion and &s;ufferings, is the meritorious rea&s;on of men's being received again into the favour of God. It was through di&s;obedience that man lo&s;t the favour of his Maker, and it is by obedience, that any of fallen <HI>Adam</HI>'s po&s;terity are re&s;tored to it again:&mdash;For,
<Q>as by one man's di&s;obedi|ence many were made &s;inners, &s;o by the obedience of one &s;hall many be made righteous, <BIBL><HI>Rom.</HI> v. 19.</BIBL></Q> But before our Redeemer could procure the favour of God, as an in|heritance to eternal life, it was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould be related to tho&s;e for whom he was to obtain it.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That que&s;tion, whether JESUS CHRIST procured the love of God, is a very needle&s;s one. Had tho&s;e who moved it attended to the plain meaning of words, they would never have propo&s;ed it.</P>

<P>The Divine love or good-will con&s;iders all the cho&s;en of God as one in CHRIST, but his grace and favour re&s;pect them as many members of the one body. The Almighty had but one good-will to all his peo|ple, as the body of CHRIST, which he expre&s;&s;ed in
<Q>chu&s;ing them in him before the world began.</Q> But his favours are many, according to the number and wants of his members. It is agreed, almo&s;t on all hands, that man lo&s;t the favour of God, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing his law.&mdash;It is al&s;o manife&s;t from &s;cripture that man's life lies in the favour of his Maker. If this is really the ca&s;e, that the fir&s;t man lo&s;t life and happi|ne&s;s, by forfeiting the favour of the Almighty, it is as manife&s;t that the &s;econd man obtained it to his people, by procuring his favour. Eter|nal life which lies in the favour of God, is now be&s;towed through the channel of a ran&s;om, or purcha&s;e, which our Redeemer paid to remove the forfeiture of happine&s;s, by &s;hedding his blood.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle tells us,
<Q>that the gift of God is eternal life through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord;</Q> for though our Redeemer paid the ran&s;om price of his blood for the chri&s;tian's inheritance, it is &s;till the gift of God to us, as much as it had never been procured by price;&mdash;becau&s;e we can give nothing for its ran&s;om.&mdash;Be&s;ides, it was JEHOVAH him&s;elf that provided, and was plea&s;ed to admit a Goal. According to the fir&s;t revelation of the will of God, Redemption was nece&s;&s;ary to clear the character of the Lawgiver from all imputation of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,&mdash;and

<Q>proclaims liberty to the captives, and the opening of the pri&s;on doors to tho&s;e who are bound.</Q> It exhibits very great and precious promi&s;es, to all who believe in JESUS CHRIST, and affords the &s;ure&s;t rea&s;on of hope to the mi&s;erable and wretched.

It &s;ays not one word of peace or pardon to the wi&s;e man, or the di&s;puter of this world, while it &s;catters its influence among tho&s;e who are ac|counted wor&s;t by the &s;ons of pride.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">THIS word of JESUS CHRIST, which &s;aves men from the power of &s;in, and the captivity of the Devil, has in|deed an influence upon its enemies;&mdash;but it is to torment them, as it doth their father the Devil,&mdash;<Q>who believes and trembles.</Q> The &s;ame word that begets faith in the &s;ouls of tho&s;e who are called, and gives hope and great joy to the wretched and mi&s;erable among men, begets pain and remor&s;e in the con&s;ciences of the proud, and torment in the minds of Devils.

<P>JESUS CHRIST delivers his people when they are in captivity, by opening their eyes, and pointing out to them the way of e&s;cape. He opens men's blinded under&s;tand|ings by the light of his go&s;pel, and brings them

<P>IT was nece&s;&s;ary that our Redeemer &s;hould be a party in that covenant, according to which &s;inners were to be &s;aved. No per&s;on who was not able, and worthy to treat with JEHOVAH, and to engage his heart to approach unto him, could be qualified to redeem lo&s;t &s;inners.&mdash; And &s;uppo&s;e he had been qualified, yet if he had not ac|tually done it, he would have wanted a true legal qualifi|cation for his work. Such as do act for others in mat|ters where law is concerned, do not merely act according to their ability, and per&s;onal endowments, but according to the law that relates to the tran&s;action. Per&s;onal endow|ments were e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, but mutual and actual engagements were morally nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o. As our LORD JESUS CHRIST intended to redeem his people, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for him as their covenant-head, to be mutually en|gaged for them, in a contract mutually with his Father, and their God;&mdash;that &s;o the will of the parties engaged might be one joint coun&s;el:&mdash;So the Prophet tells us, that
<Q>the council of peace was between them both, <BIBL><HI>Zech.</HI> vi. 13.</BIBL></Q> Had not CHRIST been a party in the cove|nant of peace, all that he did could not have been an&s;wer|able
<PB N="32" REF="33">to the breach of the covenant of works. The fir&s;t covenant was broken by <HI>Adam,</HI> as a party in it, and his po&s;terity were ruined in con&s;equence thereof;&mdash;&s;o the children of our Redeemer are &s;aved from the ruin of the fir&s;t covenant by his being a party in the &s;econd: I have, &s;aith God,
<Q>made a covenant with my cho&s;en, <BIBL><HI>P&s;al.</HI> lxxxix. 3.</BIBL></Q> By our Redeemer being a party in the covenant of grace, he was qualified to plead the benefits of his redemption for his people when the conditions in that covenant were fulfilled, and could plead the original contract, as a party that was worthy to covenant with God.&mdash;Thus, by having really covenanted for guilty &s;inners, he was qualified to a&s;certain the number of his &s;eed,&mdash;through his knowledge of the contract in which he was a party:&mdash;And could plead the word of the Fa|ther in that covenant made with him,
<Q>when he &s;hall make his &s;oul an offering for &s;in, he &s;hall &s;ee his &s;eed, and prolong his days, and the plea&s;ure of the Lord &s;hall pro&s;per in his hand.</Q> With regard to all this as a party in the covenant of peace, he could &s;ay, Lord, do as thou ha&s;t &s;aid.</P>
<P>OUR Redeemer's being a party in the new covenant qualified him to know both the number of his &s;piritual &s;eed, and the great and good things that are laid up for them in the covenant of grace and promi&s;e. In con&s;e|quence thereof he could very properly pardon &s;in, and for|give the iniquity of the guilty, becau&s;e he knew what he had contracted for in their behalf, and what he was able to do in fulfilling his contract. Had not our Saviour been a party in that covenant his &s;urety&s;hip could have no way been an&s;werable to the nece&s;&s;ity of guilty man,&mdash; who needed one &s;ub&s;tituted in his place as a covenant-party. It was entirely owing to the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI>'s being a party in the fir&s;t covenant, that his po&s;terity were found guilty for the breach of it, and it is becau&s;e JESUS CHRIST is a party in the &s;econd covenant, that his righteou&s;ne&s;s in fulfilling it, as their &s;urety, is the rea&s;on of their accep|tance with God. Our Saviour's righteou&s;ne&s;s could not have been a covenant one, unle&s;s he had been a party in it. So it was an e&s;&s;ential qualification to JESUS CHRIST our Saviour to be a party in the covenant of grace.</P>

<P>IT was an e&s;&s;ential qualification in our Redeemer to be related to both God and man. Man's Redemption could not have been effected by any not truly God, and really man:&mdash;For Deity could not &s;uffer, and a mere man could not have given &s;uch a ran&s;om as was an&s;wer|able to the &s;pirit of the law, and the demands of ju&s;tice.&mdash; And moreover, as man had offended God, and incurred his ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure by di&s;obedience, it was nece&s;&s;ary the Reconciler &s;hould be able to plea&s;e God, and re&s;tore man into his favour.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When we &s;peak of CHRIST reconciling us to GOD, I know that &s;ome alledge that no more is meant than taking away of the enmity of our minds again&s;t him.&mdash;But the &s;cripture &s;eems to &s;ignify &s;omething more, that CHRIST had to peform a work whereby it might appear con&s;i&s;tent with GOD's holy character, to expre&s;s him&s;elf well plea&s;ed towards them who have offended him&mdash;And though nothing which CHRIST did made any change in the Divine mind, yet it makes a great alteration in his conduct towards man.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>THE mo&s;t perfect man that ever exi&s;ted, even the human nature of JESUS CHRIST, unle&s;s it had been u|nited to the Deity, could not have effected man's Re|demption:&mdash;For the mo&s;t perfect finite &s;ervice could merit no more than a finite reward, and the death of a finite per&s;on could not in the nature of the thing be a price of Redemption from an infinite cur&s;e,&mdash;ju&s;tly pro|nounced again&s;t &s;in, wherever it &s;hould be found, or in whatever form.</P>
<P>THERE were two things which made it impo&s;&s;ible for a mere man to redeem a guilty world.&mdash;The nature of ju&s;tice required that there &s;hould be adequate &s;atisfac|tion made for the offence committed, that the character of the Mo&s;t High might be ju&s;tified in ju&s;tifying the un|godly. Though we may conceive many things, which we think the Almighty might do, or have done, &s;o far as they re&s;pect our intere&s;t; yet we are not certain that he could have done otherwi&s;e:&mdash;On the contrary, we are rather &s;ure, that he could not morally have acted other|wi&s;e or than he would have done it. It is not our part
<PB N="34" REF="35">to &s;ay what our Maker could have done as to his power, or any other attribute of his nature;&mdash;but whether ac|cording to the &s;y&s;tem of his government revealed to us, could he have acted otherwi&s;e agreeable thereto? Was the fir&s;t &s;y&s;tem which man was placed in perfect: And did God &s;peak in earne&s;t when he &s;aid,
<Q>in the day thou eate&s;t, thou &s;halt die?</Q> Will it not appear more con|formable to that &s;y&s;tem, that a perfect &s;atisfaction be given to his ju&s;tice expre&s;&s;ed in his law, by one who was able to give it, than that the Divine character be any way ob|&s;cured in its truth and veracity?</P>
<P>IT was therefore nece&s;&s;ary that our Redeemer &s;hould be God and Man, or EMMANUEL,&mdash;that he might be able to &s;upport the moral character of the Deity, by giving a righteous and perfect obedience conformable to that law,&mdash;which was an exact image of his character;&mdash; and might be able to give &s;atisfaction to what truly may be called ju&s;tice, to make a complete Redemption con|formable to the truth and holine&s;s of God. Thus quali|fied he could give all the &s;atisfaction the pure&s;t ju&s;tice could exact, in the &s;ame nature that had given the of|fence.&mdash;Nor does this repre&s;ent religion in any unfa|vourable point of light, or &s;et forth the Almighty as cruel and capricious:&mdash;When out of his mercy he found a cho&s;en one,&mdash;who at the &s;ame time that he repaired that awful breach, could &s;uffer no lo&s;s to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>HAD what JESUS CHRIST did for &s;inners ruined him|&s;elf, or had death been able to detain him pri&s;oner;&mdash; or had the making of men eternally happy, made him mi&s;erable, then might the enemies of the atonement called the &s;cheme of man's redemption a cruel &s;cheme,&mdash;and the Deity &s;evere.&mdash;But when the &s;ufferings of JESUS CHRIST were &s;alutary to men, and in the event exalted the cha|racter of the Mo&s;t High in the e&s;teem of men and angels, and brought honour to our Redeemer al&s;o, there does not appear any thing in the whole &s;cheme but what is con|&s;i&s;tent with perfect goodne&s;s.

<P>IT was nece&s;&s;ary that the human nature which CHRIST a&s;&s;umed &s;hould be perfectly innocent. Had our Saviour's human nature had either original or actual &s;in, it could not have been a proper &s;in-offering;&mdash;for in this ca&s;e he would have needed an atonement for his own iniquity.&mdash; But that nature which he a&s;&s;umed, though it was equally related to the believing &s;eed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> yet it was not par|taker of any of that pollution which is common to the nature of man. This human nature of JESUS CHRIST was &s;anctified by the Holy Gho&s;t, and brought forth in an extraordinary manner of a virgin;&mdash;and though of the &s;ame kind with that of others, was yet free of that na|tural pollution which &s;tains the be&s;t &s;ervices of &s;uch where it prevails.&mdash;But JESUS CHRIST
<Q>was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, and &s;eparated from &s;inners;</Q> without &s;in, nor was guile found in him. His &s;acrifice was &s;inle&s;s and perfect, as well as divinely pure and holy,&mdash;on account of its relation to him who is the true GOD. Though as a &s;urety he was accounted guilty, as bearing our &s;ins,&mdash;yet was he ever &s;eparated from &s;inners, in re&s;pect of every moral impurity.</P>
<P>THE pure law could not find the &s;malle&s;t defect in his &s;in-offering, nor could the &s;evere&s;t ju&s;tice &s;py the lea&s;t imperfection in that nature which was given him for a &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>THERE was a pa&s;&s;ive innocence in the human nature of JESUS CHRIST,&mdash;whereby he was morally inoffen&s;ive. He had no di&s;po&s;ition to give or to take offence, as is common among men.&mdash;He had no &s;elfi&s;h pride in him, nor any inordinate pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;ing from the connection between his &s;oul and body. Pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, not &s;ubordinate to pure rea&s;on and the will of God, are pe|culiar to corrupt and imperfect creatures: In CHRIST there were none &s;uch.

<P>BUT this was not all; the purity of his nature did not merely di&s;po&s;e him to do no evil, or injury to any, but it inclined him to &s;eek men's happine&s;s on all occa&s;ions. "He went continually about doing good," from a holy propen&s;ity of mind towards what was worthy and virtuous. Our Redeemer had no occa&s;ion to be excited to do good by any motives from without,&mdash;for he had the law of God in his heart. He had a perfect knowledge of moral rec|titude, and a perfect love of all truth;

<P>IT was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould be appointed and have in&s;tructions for his office of Redeemer. Without a &s;pe|cial appointment and proper in&s;tructions, the execution of any office would be intru&s;ion. Natural endowments may fit a per&s;on for the execution of an office, but does not morally qualify him in law, without appointment thereto. Our Redeemer did not run un&s;ent,&mdash;but

<P>IT produceth an e&s;teem of CHRIST, and all things that are his. When JESUS CHRIST makes him&s;elf known to his people as a Redeemer, and di&s;plays the glory of his Redemption unto them, the amiablene&s;s of his per&s;on, and the greatne&s;s of the &s;alvation he hath procured by his blood, quite &s;ubdues their hearts, and gains their e&s;teem. Such as &s;aw no comeline&s;s in him, why he &s;hould be de|&s;ired,&mdash;while under the power of ignorance, and the in|fluence of error, become by the manife&s;tation of his ex|cellencies altogether charmed with his beauty. It is im|po&s;&s;ible but tho&s;e who know this ble&s;&s;ed object &s;hould e&s;teem him;&mdash;becau&s;e his excellencies are morally en|gaging, and have the power to transform the mind into a &s;amene&s;s of moral likene&s;s with him&s;elf. The Apo&s;tle, who under&s;tood this &s;ubject better than mo&s;t of men, affirms it as a matter of certainty,&mdash;That
<Q>by beholding the glory of God, through Je&s;us, we are transformed into the &s;ame image, from glory to glory.</Q> There are none who know the Redeemer but do love him, and &s;uch as do not render him their &s;upreme regard, do te&s;tify that they know him not.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething in the world which men call Knowledge, which is only a <HI>&s;pecious</HI> re&s;emblance of it, yet is oftentimes mi&s;taken for true under&s;tanding. Thro' means of the go&s;pel revelation men may come to <HI>&s;ome</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="40">&s;pecious under&s;tanding of the character of JESUS CHRIST, &s;o as to enable them to &s;peak <HI>as if</HI> they knew him:&mdash; But then their knowledge is no more than the wi&s;dom of words. This kind of knowledge may be called a pa&s;&s;ing view of CHRIST's character, which may lead men to &s;ome &s;peculation, but can never be reduced to practice. This &s;ort of &s;purious knowledge is like that which we learn of the characters of men at court in the common news,&mdash; which may enable us to form conjectures concerning the leading draughts of <HI>certain</HI> reputations, but being remote from the per&s;ons, and the theatre on which they act, we are uncertain of the ju&s;tne&s;s of the various de&s;criptions of character which may be given them.&mdash;But true know|ledge of JESUS CHRIST by the go&s;pel, is like that which we attain by friendly information,&mdash;where the informer acts the part of a friendly in&s;tructor;&mdash;and knowing him&s;elf the things which he teacheth and de&s;cribeth, per|fectly repre&s;ents them with &s;uch evidence, that our know|ledge becomes certain and real.</P>
<P>THE truths of the go&s;pel, to All who have not felt their power, are only like the common news to a com|mon reader,&mdash;which may learn him to &s;peak, but does not afford any certain knowledge, nor make him any wi&s;er: &mdash;Yet, a &s;tranger would perhaps not know the differ|ence between &s;uch per&s;ons, and men of more wi&s;dom, if he only heard them &s;peak. It is action <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich te&s;tifies the truth of true knowledge;&mdash;he who pretends to know, but is not truly in&s;tructed, expo&s;eth his own ignorance when brought to trial. Chri&s;tians who are really in&s;tructed in the knowledge of the go&s;pel, and under&s;tand the character of JESUS CHRIST, are enabled according to their mea|&s;ure, to act his character as a pattern of holine&s;s;&mdash; their lives and that of CHRIST are as like one another, in the leading parts of character, as the image of babes and perfect men are like one another. It is a &s;aying common enough with regard to &s;ome per&s;ons, that it is not for want of knowledge in religion that they do not live as becomes the go&s;pel. This is not true in fact, if we con|&s;ider the word Knowledge in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e.&mdash;Whenever any per&s;on knows JESUS CHRIST rightly, it transforms him into his likene&s;s, and di&s;po&s;eth him to walk as he
<PB N="40" REF="41">al&s;o walked. The knowledge of things in which men are not much intere&s;ted, may be attained without producing any vi&s;ible alteration in their conduct,&mdash;nor would men judge fairly of their under&s;tanding, if they &s;hould con|clude them ignorant of what they did not practi&s;e,&mdash; when neither <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> nor <HI>happine&s;s</HI> are connected with &s;uch practice.&mdash;The knowledge of things indifferent, may be obtained without any vi&s;ible evidence in action;&mdash; for being indifferent, the practice upon knowing them is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. But to walk as CHRIST al&s;o walked, and to imitate him, as the ble&s;&s;ed pattern of ho|line&s;s and perfection, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to happine&s;s in this life, or that which is to come.</P>
<P>WHEN the excellencies of CHRIST are made known to the &s;ouls of men, the connection between an imitation of them, and everla&s;ting happine&s;s, is al&s;o made known;&mdash; and the very power of that knowledge inclines the minds of chri&s;tians to ob&s;erve the imitation,
<Q><BIBL><HI>P&s;al.</HI> ix. 10.</BIBL> They that know thy name, will put their tru&s;t in thee.</Q>
<Q>He that loveth not, knoweth not God, <BIBL>1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 8.</BIBL></Q> The Apo&s;tle points out the connection between true knowledge of CHRIST, and the work and labour of love.
<Q><BIBL>1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 4.</BIBL> He that &s;aith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. ver. 9. He that &s;aith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkne&s;s even until now. He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is no occa&s;ion of &s;tumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother is in darkne&s;s, and walketh in darkne&s;s, and knoweth not whither he go|eth, becau&s;e that darkne&s;s hath blinded his eyes.</Q> Tho&s;e who know God, hear and obey what the Apo&s;tles of CHRIST hath &s;aid;&mdash;but whoever form their religious practice upon any other plan, te&s;tify that they know not God,&mdash;even &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hould make a great &s;hew of Godline&s;s in will-wor&s;hip.&mdash;Let the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> deter|mine this point: <Q><BIBL>1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 6.</BIBL> We are of God: He that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God, heareth not us.&mdash;Hereby we know the Spirit of truth, and the &s;pirit of error. Beloved, let us love one ano|ther: For love is of God; and every one that loveth,
<PB N="41" REF="42">is born of God, and knoweth God.</Q> The rea&s;on why men do not e&s;teem JESUS CHRIST, and all things that are his, is becau&s;e they know him not. <HI>Luke</HI> gives this for the rea&s;on in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apo&s;tles, why the <HI>Jews</HI> condemned and crucified JESUS CHRIST, becau&s;e they knew him not,
<Q><BIBL><HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 27.</BIBL> For they that dwell at Jeru&s;alem, becau&s;e they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.</Q></P>
<P>WHEREVER JESUS CHRIST makes a true and real di&s;|covery of his own Character and Redemption to the &s;ouls of men by his go&s;pel,&mdash;&s;o as the di&s;covery becomes the materials of knowledge, or rather knowledge it&s;elf, it as nece&s;&s;arily begets e&s;teem of JESUS, as any active principle produceth its <HI>proper</HI> effects. It becomes a part of a be|liever's moral con&s;titution, and operates in the &s;oul as a principle of action:&mdash;And this knowledge expre&s;&s;eth it|&s;elf in the way of e&s;teeming CHRIST, and all that is his. Such as do not e&s;teem our Redeemer, it is becau&s;e they do not know him:&mdash;They have not the full conviction of his excellence, fitne&s;s, and &s;ufficiency.</P>
<P>I KNOW it has been often &s;aid, that men may have the knowledge and full conviction of the truth, and yet not be truely reformed thereby.&mdash;This I cannot &s;o ea&s;ily under&s;tand:&mdash;For our Saviour tells us, that &s;uch as know the truth, are &s;et at liberty.&mdash;<Q>Ye &s;hall know the truth, and the truth &s;hall make you free, <BIBL><HI>John</HI> viii. 32.</BIBL></Q> Wherever the &s;cripture &s;peaks of wicked men knowing God, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood comparatively with others who are more ignorant of the things which they are &s;aid to know. A &s;ervant may know his ma&s;ter's will, and not do it, <HI>i. e.</HI> the things which he knoweth may be what his ma&s;ter requireth, but &s;till he does not know as he ought to know,&mdash;and it is called knowledge, in contra&s;t to other men's total ignorance. As long as men are not reformed in their hearts and lives, they cannot properly be &s;aid to be convinced of truth,&mdash;nor accounted &s;uch who know JESUS CHRIST;&mdash;and it is their ignorance which keep|eth them in bondage to Satan.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="43">THEY have &s;uch wi&s;dom which pa&s;&s;eth for true know|ledge in the world, and which may make a very &s;pecious appearance, and deceive men;&mdash;but it never proves its efficacy by that labour of love, and e&s;teem of JESUS CHRIST, which true knowledge produceth in them who have it. What <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays of wi&s;dom, may be &s;trictly &s;aid of knowledge,&mdash;<Q>It giveth life to them who have it.</Q> What has made men fall into a mi&s;take, in thinking that them&s;elves or others have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of true knowledge, when they have been really ignorant of truth, is their not con&s;idering the difference between tran|&s;ient views, and &s;olid under&s;tanding. There are many tran&s;ient and pa&s;&s;ing views, which per&s;ons may have of objects, which cannot ju&s;tly be called true knowledge.&mdash; In objects of &s;enfe they may be called glances,&mdash;in objects of moral truth, they may be called hints,&mdash;in matters of fact, or te&s;timony, they may be called notices. Men may have &s;ome glances of a figure who&s;e properties they do not under&s;tand, and &s;uppo&s;e they had a pa&s;&s;ing view of it, yet they do not under&s;tand the form nor u&s;e of it without in&s;truction:&mdash;A moral truth may be repre&s;ented to our mind by &s;ome hints, but is either removed before we un|der&s;tand it, or the mind parts with it before it knows it:&mdash; Matters of fact may be brought to our hearing upon a credible enough te&s;timony, which may give notice of very &s;urpri&s;ing or profitable things;&mdash;but the notices may either be &s;hort and imperfect, or not often enough repeat|ed to leave an impre&s;&s;ion of the truth of the facts, and the authority of the author upon our minds,&mdash;and in this re|&s;pect is not true knowledge. This is &s;omething like a tale that is told,&mdash;which though it may afford for the time &s;ome entertainment, is not competent to be reduced into practice.</P>
<P>THOSE three kinds of pa&s;&s;ing views may be illu&s;trated by the&s;e &s;imilitudes.&mdash;The fir&s;t is like one who views his face in a gla&s;s, but forgets what manner of man he was:&mdash;The &s;econd is like one who receives the dictates of a ma&s;ter upon a &s;ubject, the rudiments of which he hath never learned,&mdash;&s;o has no knowledge of, but as far as any thing he hath heard &s;aid is agreeable with &s;ome|thing
<PB N="43" REF="44">he has already learned:&mdash;The latter is like one who receives the news from another who pa&s;&s;eth by, but is not able to form a judgment of what is reported,&mdash;becau&s;e he has not time to be acquainted with the author who re|ports the facts. That knowledge which &s;uperficial en|quirers have in matters of religion, is like the two la&s;t forts of knowledge. Things marvelous may tran&s;iently be pointed out to them,&mdash;and alarming facts may be told them, which may &s;urprize them,&mdash;or create a &s;udden tran&s;port of wonder or fear, according to the nature of the things intimated.&mdash;But what &s;o &s;uddenly &s;truck them, may as quickly be removed, &s;o that it never be|comes a principle of action in their hearts, nor leaves any ju&s;t or la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion upon their minds.&mdash;This nei|ther affords a &s;ufficient information to the judgment, nor produceth a full conviction in the con&s;cience, of the truth of what is reported. It is only a tran&s;ient pa&s;&s;ing view of truth, but not the knowledge thereof. The knowledge of JESUS CHRIST con&s;i&s;ts in the under&s;tanding of the character of him that &s;peaketh;&mdash;when he makes the report the matter of knowledge in the &s;oul, he maketh it &s;hew his own veracity, and a believer is in&s;tructed as well in the character of the per&s;on who reveals the truth, as in the report he makes.</P>
<P>THE go&s;pel has this excellency above all other re|ports:&mdash;That it is calculated to make known the charac|ter and veracity of him who publi&s;heth it, and &s;heweth with the &s;ure&s;t evidence, who he is that is the author of it. We have no proof but what the go&s;pel it&s;elf contains, that God is the author of it,&mdash;nor have we any certain evidence to &s;atisfy us that we are not impo&s;ed upon, but what is expre&s;&s;ed in the very te&s;timony we believe. Who|ever believes the go&s;pel, is firmly per&s;uaded at once, that it is God that &s;peaks, and his word they believe. The fir&s;t true knowledge of God comes by the go&s;pel,&mdash;and it is calculated to produce it. It is much better contrived to make us under&s;tand, what God is, and what are his at|tributes, than all his works put together, for it gives light. "The entrance of thy word giveth light." Divine re|velation is too often con&s;idered as a <HI>&s;ort</HI> of pa&s;&s;ive organ, &s;omething like the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, which are &s;aid
<PB N="44" REF="45">to declare the Glory of God;&mdash;and there are &s;everal people in the world will with difficulty admit that we can know it to be from God, till we learn it <HI>extra &s;eip&s;um,</HI> without it&s;elf.&mdash;But the difficulty here is in&s;urmount|able, and ends in <HI>Athei&s;m.</HI> For when men depart from &s;cripture it&s;elf, to &s;eek for the knowledge of its author,&mdash; where do they land? In eternal doubts, and &s;ceptici&s;m.
<Q>By faith we under&s;tand, that the worlds were made by the word of God.</Q>&mdash;By the knowledge of the &s;acred records we learn the character of their author, and re|ceive the certain proof that God made the world:&mdash;But when we begin to &s;eek the Divine Character among his works at fir&s;t hand, on purpo&s;e to &s;ettle the character of &s;cripture, we are obliged fir&s;t to prove, that the univer&s;e is his handy work.&mdash;This is &s;till more difficult to prove without help from the &s;cripture, than to find the charac|ter of the author of revelation without &s;uch aid. The go&s;pel &s;eems to be &s;uited to &s;ome capacity in us, whereby it produceth in our minds an a&s;&s;ent to its truth by making known its author.</P>
<P>THIS knowledge is not like opinion, which is found|ed upon probability, nor like conjecture, which is ground|ed only on &s;ome probable marks of truth;&mdash;but is founded upon certain under&s;tanding of facts, concerning which there can be no rea&s;onable doubt; and on the te&s;timony of one who neither will nor can deceive us.</P>
<P>WHEN this knowledge is obtained, it is not like opinion, which may vary with probability, but it becomes a principle of action in the mind,&mdash;and in its nature varies no more than the record on which it is founded. It may have degrees, according to the mea&s;ure of divine manife&s;tation;&mdash;but as to its nature, it is founded upon principles that are invariable. It may increa&s;e or decline upon occa&s;ions, but can never totally fail, more than its fir&s;t principles can be de&s;troyed. It is compared
<Q>to the &s;hining light, which &s;hineth more and more unto the perfect day.</Q> This knowledge begets a la&s;ting e&s;teem of CHRIST, on account of his many excellencies that are the &s;um of that heavenly wi&s;dom.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">FROM the divine records the chri&s;tian is informed, that the Redeemer is a divine per&s;on,&mdash;<Q>Fairer than the &s;ons of men, and more excellent than all mountains of prey.</Q>&mdash;That he excells in wi&s;dom, power, goodne&s;s and truth;&mdash;but re&s;ts in his love, and rejoiceth in mer|cy. Tho&s;e who know JESUS CHRIST, con&s;ider him not only as mighty to &s;ave, but as the mo&s;t excellent object of contemplation and delight,&mdash;having in him every beauty which can give plea&s;ure to the mind. It was from a certain knowledge of <HI>this</HI> that <HI>David</HI> expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o earne&s;t|ly in the&s;e pathetic lines,
<Q><BIBL><HI>P&s;al.</HI> xxvii. 4.</BIBL> One thing have I de&s;ired of the Lord, and that will I &s;eek after; that all the days of my life I may dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord, to behold his beauty, and enquire in his temple.</Q> The chri&s;tian's e&s;teem of JESUS is founded upon what is amiable in his character;&mdash;what is not more &s;triking than it is &s;weet. In this, love and e&s;teem are &s;omething di&s;tinct. Love, which is the de&s;ire of enjoy|ment of any object that is agreeable, con&s;idered at &s;ome di&s;tance, is more engaged with what is &s;triking, than what is amiable;&mdash;but when the object is obtained, and all the &s;triking parts of character appear mixed with &s;weetne&s;s and amiablene&s;s,&mdash;then love re&s;ts in the object, and becomes la&s;ting e&s;teem.</P>
<P>WHEN a mi&s;erable &s;inner, under the apprehen&s;ions of guilt and the Divine di&s;plea&s;ure, receives the intimation of the Redeemer's character, as one who hath paid his ran|&s;om, and hath delivered him from going down to the pit, he is ready to be enamoured with his love and com|pa&s;&s;ion,&mdash;and admires him rather as one who hath done him a real &s;ervice, than one who is intrin&s;ickly worthy of his highe&s;t regard;&mdash;but when he comes to con&s;ider his character more &s;trictly, after his &s;urprize at his mercy is &s;omewhat abated, he comes to &s;ee that his chief happine&s;s lies in being joined in fellow&s;hip with one, who in all re|&s;pects is &s;o engaging, that his &s;oul will never need any thing more to &s;atisfy its de&s;ires, through an endle&s;s tract of duration. When CHRIST and his redemption is ma|nife&s;ted in the &s;oul, the mind re&s;ts in the e&s;teem of him,&mdash; who is worthy of its mo&s;t exalted regards.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">BUT this knowledge makes chri&s;tians al&s;o e&s;teem all that is CHRIST's.&mdash;Every appointment of his, and every ordinance which bears the &s;tamp of his authority, are dear to them who know him.&mdash;His character as a Lawgiver, who rules in mount Zion, is the object of their e&s;teem,&mdash; and therefore all his laws appear righteous. It is not how agreeable &s;ome ordinances are to fle&s;h and blood, or how they may &s;uit the ends of worldly policy and temporal in|tere&s;t, that engageth a chri&s;tian to ob&s;erve them,&mdash;but whether they have the &s;eal of CHRIST's appointment add|ed to them. The knowledge of CHRIST, our Redeemer, teacheth all his children to con&s;ider obedience to him in ob&s;erving his ordinances, not as means which merely lead to glory,&mdash;but a very part of glory <HI>it&s;elf;</HI>&mdash;for it is their glory to keep his commandments, in every &s;tage of exi&s;tence what&s;oever. The children of heavenly wi&s;dom wi&s;ely con&s;ider, that there is no difference between the militant &s;tate of CHRIST's church, and that of the tri|umphant, with re&s;pect to men's obligation to obey him,&mdash; nor will they ever have any de&s;ire to be freed from his &s;ervice.&mdash;And therefore they con&s;ider the&s;e ordinances, which are appointed to them in this life to ob&s;erve, as the only heavenly exerci&s;e they are capable of for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THOSE who know JESUS CHRIST, their Redeemer, are not taken with the &s;plendour of rituals, nor engaged with the pompous means of devotion;&mdash;but are more concerned about the &s;pirit and truth of religion, than the elegance of external modes of wor&s;hip. When they come to the hou&s;e of God,
<Q>they are more ready to hear than to give the &s;acrifice of fools.</Q> The vocal prai&s;e of chri&s;tian wor&s;hip gives them more plea&s;ure,&mdash;becau&s;e they can mutually join in that devotion, than all the &s;ymphany of in&s;trumental mu&s;ic. The <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;ound of Organs, Symbols, and Harps, give no delight to a chri&s;tian's ear, becau&s;e CHRIST has not commanded that mode of prai&s;e in the New Te&s;tament &s;anctuary. Such as know CHRIST crucified, chu&s;e to direct their devotion by &s;ome expre&s;s laws of his authori&s;ing, and will not venture to perform his &s;ervice according to their own will and plea&s;ure.&mdash;
<PB N="47" REF="48">They e&s;teem all his precepts and promi&s;es,&mdash;they &s;ay of his commandments, that in all things they are right. Every promi&s;e is the object of a believer's tru&s;t and confi|dence,&mdash;and what their Lord &s;ays, they are able to re|ceive as faithful &s;ayings:&mdash;Becau&s;e they know the ve|racity of the author, they chearfully tru&s;t his promi&s;e. Though many circum&s;tances in providence may intervene, &s;eemingly unfavourable to the accompli&s;hment of God's promi&s;e, yet the knowledge they have of the Divine cha|racter, &s;upports their confidence under every unfavourable circum&s;tance.&mdash;Being &s;atisfied concerning God's love towards them, by his giving his &s;on, they conclude, that with him he will freely give them all things.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, they who have been favoured with the di&s;covery of CHRIST's character as their Redeemer, will love all the children of their heavenly father;&mdash;for as they e&s;teem him that begat, they will al&s;o love them that are begotten. This e&s;teem is of the &s;ame kind towards all tho&s;e who receive the truth in the love thereof, and who bear the image of their heavenly father.&mdash;And tho' the children of God may differ in their moral &s;tature, or have different views of &s;ome things:&mdash;Though they may have different gifts, and various imperfections, in this pre&s;ent &s;tate;&mdash;yet they e&s;teem one another on account of their common relation to the one Father in JESUS CHRIST. Difference in outward circum&s;tance, or variance in opi|nion, will not alter their opinion of one another,&mdash;while they agree in the original principles of knowledge;&mdash; namely, the knowledge of CHRIST crucified. Whenever men begin to di&s;e&s;teem one another, and in&s;tead of loving one another, do mo&s;t heartily hate each other, there is rea|&s;on to fear &s;omething wor&s;e than difference in opinion.&mdash; Nothing but total ignorance of JESUS CHRIST will pro|duce &s;uch a di&s;mal effect. Men's opinions are what they cannot help, more than they can add a cubit to their &s;ta|ture,&mdash;and if we think them wrong, we ought to pity them, but not hate them. Chri&s;tian love begets compa&s;&s;ion for a brother when he errs, and will not &s;uffer the mind to re|move its regards for what is only his misfortune.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. 2d.</HEAD>
<P>IT produceth peace and tranquillity of mind. When chri&s;tians have attained to the true knowledge of CHRIST, and the Redemption he hath obtained for them, they re|ceive full &s;atisfaction concerning their peace with God through him,&mdash;and are per&s;uaded they &s;hall not be brought into condemnation; or in the language of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI>
<Q>They &s;hall not die but live, and di&s;cover the works of the Lord.</Q> This occa&s;ions an inward cafe and &s;atis|faction of &s;oul,&mdash;becau&s;e God, who is the chief good, and who&s;e anger is mo&s;t to be dreaded, is now reconciled through the blood of JESUS to the guilty.</P>
<P>WHEN this great privilege is obtained, the children of heavenly wi&s;dom find no occa&s;ion to be troubled with what pa&s;&s;es in the world;&mdash;for this rea&s;on, be they poor or rich, weak or &s;trong, as to the things pertaining to this life, they are content, becau&s;e their trea&s;ure is in heaven. Satisfaction concerning peace with our Maker, not only makes us ea&s;y our&s;elves, but makes us behave ea&s;ily towards others with whom we may be concerned. It does not appear that per&s;ons who behave with &s;everity towards their fellow man, have any plea&s;ure in contemplating the Divine character;&mdash;for all &s;everity proceeds from a &s;our|ne&s;s of mind, which the love of God &s;ubdues wherever it prevails. When men, called chri&s;tians, through a cruel|ty of di&s;po&s;ition, endeavour to hurt one another, for con&s;cience &s;ake, it argues they have but bad con&s;ciences: For if their con&s;ciences were purified, they would endea|vour to follow peace with all men. All true peace of mind ari&s;es from &s;atisfaction with tho&s;e things that are the object of moral contemplation. There are two things e&s;pecially which fall under this denomination,&mdash;the relations we &s;tand in to God,&mdash;and the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery that ari&s;e to us from tho&s;e relations. When the&s;e appear favourable to us, they make us happy, when we contemplate them; if unfavourable, they make us un|happy.</P>
<P>WHEN upon enquiry it is found, that the character
<PB N="49" REF="50">of God appears oppo&s;ite to what we find to be our own pre&s;ent leading character, it mu&s;t produce a very great unea&s;ine&s;s in the mind, and make us unhappy. If we find that God &s;tands in the relation of a ju&s;t and righteous judge to us, and we in the relation of guilty &s;inners, it will cau&s;e no little pain and unea&s;ine&s;s, if we be not quite pa&s;t feeling.&mdash;But if it is found, that he is related to us as a gracious and reconciled God, thro' JESUS CHRIST, be&s;towing pardon freely upon the guilty, it will produce peace and &s;atisfaction in the &s;oul. Our happine&s;s and mi&s;ery entirely depend upon what relation we &s;tand in to God, and he to us. To con&s;ider him as a ju&s;t Judge, without perceiving his character as reconciled through his beloved Son, &s;ets before us a very awful pro&s;pect;&mdash; for in that character he condemns the guilty.&mdash;But when he is con&s;idered as the LORD GOD, merciful and gracious, in JESUS CHRIST, he is repre&s;ented, as ju&s;t, and yet the ju&s;tifier of the ungodly. When this great point of peace with God is obtained, and the intimation of it made to the con&s;cience, contentment with every o|ther circum&s;tance of life will be the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence; this will di&s;po&s;e men to live peaceably, as far as in them lies with every one. It argues a bad con&s;cience, and corrupt heart, to have a con&s;tant di&s;po&s;ition to quarrel with others about things that are no ways momentous. When we con&s;ider the connection of what has been &s;aid, we &s;hall not be able to give any other rea&s;on for men fall|ing out with their fellow chri&s;tians and brethren, but that they know not JESUS CHRIST, and are at variance with their Maker;&mdash;for were they in good terms with the Almighty, they would find no great difficulty to live peaceably with all men.&mdash;And we may ea&s;ily learn from ob&s;ervation, that a good man is not at &s;o much difficulty to live peaceably with his enemies, as bad men and hypo|crites are to live in peace with their mo&s;t intimate friends. Whoever is fully per&s;uaded of what JESUS hath done for them, will not grudge to &s;eek peace with their very foes; &mdash;they know they cannot follow a better example, than that of CHRIST. The various murmurings which pre|vail among nominal profe&s;&s;ors of religion, only te&s;tify how little they are acquainted with that Saviour who died to
<PB N="50" REF="51">make peace for men, and &s;hed his precious blood to ob|tain for them forgivene&s;s of &s;in.</P>
<P>THERE are many more effects which the manife&s;tation of CHRIST, and Redemption through him, produce in the &s;ouls of tho&s;e who believe the record concerning him,&mdash; which I am obliged to leave out of this E&s;&s;ay, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;well it to an undue &s;ize.&mdash;I &s;hall therefore fini&s;h it with ob&s;erving, that our whole conver&s;ation will be directed according to our knowledge and belief of this &s;ubject. Wherever it prevails as an article of religion in truth, it will di&s;po&s;e the believers to walk as CHRIST al&s;o walked. It is one of tho&s;e doctrines of grace that purify the heart, and animates the whole conduct of chri&s;tians.&mdash;Infidelity in this particular will not long lie concealed,&mdash;for as a man thinketh, &s;o is he,&mdash;and he will &s;hew the abundance of his heart by the manner of his acting.&mdash;But all who believe in CHRIST will be careful to maintain good works.</P>
