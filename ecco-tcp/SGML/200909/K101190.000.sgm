<PB N="6" REF="4">
in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts and countries, as an indi&s;pen&s;able DUTY, by <Q>THE LAW OF NATURE AND NATIONS, <HI>that we may become a&s;&s;i&s;ting</HI></Q> (&s;ays Cowel, tit. 2.) <Q><HI>both to our parents and country; and</HI> REPELL FORCE AND IN|JURY: <HI>and from hence it comes,</HI></Q> (&s;ays he,) <Q><HI>that what&s;oever we do, for the de|fence of our own bodies, is adjudged legal.</HI></Q> For which he cites Bracton, l. i. c. 6.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This c. 6. &s;eems to be an error of the pre&s;s, in&s;tead of c. 5. num. 7. the proper reference to Bracton's dec|laration concerning the NATURAL RIGHT of all men <HI>to</HI> RESIST VIOLENCE AND INJURY.&mdash; <Q><HI>Hoc autem jus gentium &s;oium hominibus commune e&s;t, veluti erga Deum religio, ut parentibus et patriae pareamus, ut</HI> VIM <HI>atque</HI> INJURIAM PROPULSEMUS, <HI>nam</HI> DE JURE <HI>hoc evenit, ut quod quis ob &s;ui tutelam corporis fecerit,</HI> JURE <HI>feci&s;&s;e exi&s;timetur.

<P>The exerci&s;e of the Long-bow was formerly e&s;teemed the mo&s;t effectual mi|litary di&s;cipline for the defence of the kingdom, and is &s;o declared in another act of parliament of the &s;ame year, cap. 6.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>&mdash; <Q><HI>Divers gentlemen, yeomen, and &s;erving-men,</HI> now of late have laid apart the <HI>good and laudable exer|ci&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Long-bow,</HI> which always heretofore hath been <HI>the &s;urety, &s;afeguard, and continual defence, of this realm of England, and an ine&s;timable aread and terror to the enemies of the &s;ame.</HI></Q> (Extract from the preamble to the act of 33 Hen. VIII. c. 6.)</P>
<P>Hence it is plain, that <Q>gentlemen, yeomen, and &s;erving men,</Q> were required, by law, to be <HI>exerci&s;ed in the u&s;e of &s;uch arms</HI> as were e&s;teemed the be&s;t for the &s;afe|guard and defence of the realm.</P></NOTE> and, therefore, as the law, at that time, <HI>required</HI> EVERY MAN <HI>to be exer|ci&s;ed</HI> in the u&s;e of the <HI>then</HI> fa&s;hionable weapons, the rea&s;on of the law holds e|qually
<PB N="15" REF="13">
good, to <HI>require the exerci&s;e of</HI> ALL MEN in the u&s;e of the pre&s;ent fa&s;hionable weapons, the <HI>mu&s;quet and bayonet.</HI></P>
<P>But even at that time, the u&s;e of mu&s;|quets, or guns, was allowed to the inha|bitants of all cities, boroughs, and mar|ket-towns, and for the very fame rea&s;on, (the defence of the realm,) by a provi&s;io|nal clau&s;e of the la&s;t-mentioned act, &sect; vi. <Q>Provided alway, and be it enact|ed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that it &s;hall be lawful, from henceforth, to all gentlemen, yeomen, and &s;erving-men of every lord, &s;piri|tual and temporal, and of all knights, e&s;quires, and gentlemen, and to ALL THE INHABITANTS <HI>of cities, bo|roughs,</HI> and <HI>market-towns,</HI> of this realm of England, to &s;hoot with any hand-gun, demihake, or hagbut, at any butt or bank of earth, only in <HI>place con|venient for the &s;ame,</HI></Q> (whereby it ap|pears that proper places for exerci&s;e

Thus &s;tood the law &s;o late as the latter end of queen Elizabeth's reign, when the book la&s;t-cited was publi&s;hed; and the general tenor of the doctrine, re&s;pecting the <HI>right of Engli&s;hmen to have arms,</HI> hath &s;ince been confirmed, by <HI>the Declaration of Rights in the Act of Settlement,</HI> (1 Wm &amp; Mary, &s;t. 2, c. 2,) though it &s;eems now to be limited to <HI>Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, viz.</HI> <Q><HI>That the &s;ubjects which are Prote&s;|tants</HI> MAY HAVE ARMS FOR THEIR DEFENCE, <HI>&s;uitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law.</HI></Q>&mdash;This latter expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>"as allowed by law,"</HI> re&s;pects the limitations in the above-mentioned act

<P>THE e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;tanding armies is, perhaps, the mo&s;t dan|gerous of all political expedients, and has been fatal to the liberty of every na|tion upon earth that has adopted it; and, therefore, though the doctrine of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> is generally pleaded to excu&s;e the mea|&s;ure,

<P>Whenever the public &s;afety demands the a&s;&s;embling and continuance of a large body of troops in actual &s;ervice, to watch and re&s;i&s;t the motions of any powerful in|vader, a regular military <Q><HI>Ro&s;ter of Service,</HI></Q> from the <HI>whole national mi|litia,</HI> is the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t means of forming and continuing &s;uch an army in the field; becau&s;e it would be, not only, the lea&s;t burthen&s;ome to individuals, but
<PB N="37" REF="34">
al&s;o le&s;s dangerous to the community at large; for, if the regularity of <HI>rotation</HI> were duly ob&s;erved, no man would be &s;o long detained from his ordinary calling and occupation as to lo&s;e his <HI>civil capa|city</HI> and way of livelihood at home, nor be thereby unwarily drawn into a <HI>&s;eparate intere&s;t</HI> from his fellow-citizens; which was unhappily the ca&s;e of the Parliament's army in 1647; for, after having bravely defended the <HI>national liberty</HI> for &s;ome years, this very army became the in&s;tru|ment of a mo&s;t hateful national <HI>bondage,</HI> under a military tyrant!</P>
<P>The nature of a Ro&s;ter is well de&s;cri|bed by General Bland, in his Treati&s;e of military Di&s;cipline, from p. 287 to 312.

And, nearly on the &s;ame plan, tables might be formed, for detaching the <HI>individuals of a national militia from the &s;everal pari&s;hes, or di&s;tricts, to which they belong, in due proportion to the number of males enrolled in each of them;</HI> whereby the hard&s;hip and inconveniences of mili|tary duty for the common &s;afety would be equally divided among the whole na|tion; and, of cour&s;e, the time of actual &s;ervice would be mo&s;t profitably dimini&s;h|ed
<PB N="39" REF="36">
to each individual, whil&s;t the know|ledge of arms and di&s;cipline would be re|gularly <HI>circulated</HI> into all parts of the country; and with it al&s;o &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible perception, to each individual, of his fel|low&s;hip, or incorporation, with the whole national community, as would plainly tend to prevent all partial and undue emu|lation of particular counties or di&s;tricts a|gain&s;t their neighbours: for, by &s;uch provincial jealou&s;ies, the ancient &s;tates of Greece were unhappily di&s;united, and their attention withdrawn from that true mutual intere&s;t and defence of each other, without which none of them could long &s;ub&s;i&s;t in freedom: whereas, if (on the contrary) they had been inured to the &s;o|cial duty of &s;erving in one common army, drawn equally from each confederate &s;tate, by a proper <HI>"Table of Proportion,"</HI> and duly changed by <HI>rotation,</HI> (to pre|vent them from becoming <HI>mere &s;oldiers,</HI>) there would have been no ju&s;t cau&s;e to

<P>The general body of individuals, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, indeed, &s;ubmit them&s;elves to &s;erve, by rotation, the humble &s;tation of private &s;oldiers; but the time of &s;er|vice being limited, and <HI>equal</HI> to all men in duration, it would be no great hard|&s;hip, e&s;pecially if each freeman that bears arms was allowed his <HI>natural right</HI> of &s;uffrage in the &s;tate, his due &s;hare of legi&s;lative influence, to controul the commanders, and regulate the &s;ervice.</P>

would be e&s;timated at a fourth part of that number, according to the mo&s;t ge|neral mode of e&s;timation, <HI>viz.</HI> 1,500,000 men; from which number a <HI>Ro&s;ter of ac|tual &s;ervice from home,</HI> only for one month each man in the &s;pace of a whole year, would &s;upply a con&s;tant army in the field of 125,000 men, if &s;o many were nece&s;&s;ary. A continual change <HI>every month,</HI> or every <HI>fourteen days,</HI> of half a battalion at a time out of each di&s;trict, or &s;till in &s;maller proportions, <HI>viz.</HI> a few companies at a time (or even by half-companies, from &s;maller divi&s;ions or pa|ri&s;hes) would be mo&s;t advi&s;eable, that every part of the country might always re|tain nearly the proportion of eleven parts out of twelve of its own militia, as well for the purpo&s;es of guarding it, as to carry on the ordinary culti|vation, and other nece&s;&s;ary local occupa|tions, without interruption.

<P>It will probably be objected, that a national militia, which has been exerci&s;ed only in &s;mall bodies, is incapable of ef|fectual &s;ervice again&s;t an enemy: but for this a remedy may be found. Let the army be fir&s;t formed in a &s;eparate en|campment,

at &s;uch convenient di&s;tance from the enemy, that they may not be liable to an immediate attack.</P>
<P>A central &s;ituation mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be cho&s;en for this camp of di&s;cipline, where the &s;everal companies from the whole nation may be regimented under proper general-officers, and be daily ex|erci&s;ed, in <HI>large bodies,</HI> for a whole month (or &s;ix weeks, if nece&s;&s;ary) be|fore they are brought to face the enemy.

<PB N="46" REF="43">
an army of 125,000 men might be marched to the camp or camps of actual &s;ervice, to do duty for the time allotted to each upon the <HI>Ro&s;ter</HI> again&s;t the com|mon enemy; and the number might be continually kept up by monthly detach|ments of battalions from the fir&s;t camp of di&s;cipline, in proportion as the time of &s;ervice (allotted to each of the former companies upon the <HI>Ro&s;ter</HI>) &s;hould ex|pire. The country would al&s;o be guard|ed by the returning di&s;ciplined compa|nies di&s;per&s;ed in every part; and the knowledge of arms and di&s;cipline, by the time a <HI>&s;ingle circulation</HI> of the <HI>Ro&s;ter</HI> was completed, (<HI>viz.</HI> in one year,) would be diffu&s;ed throughout the <HI>whole nation;</HI> which would thereby be enabled after|wards to exert it&s;elf gloriou&s;ly upon any &s;udden emergency; for it might afford to bear even the lo&s;s of &s;ix &s;uch capital ar|mies of 125,000, <HI>viz.</HI> in all, 750,000, men, before it would be nece&s;&s;ary to in|crea&s;e the time of &s;ervice from one month

<HEAD><PB N="53" REF="48">REMARKS CONCERNING THE Trained Bands OF LONDON.</HEAD>
<P>THE Militia, or Trained Bands, of London have never been known to mi&s;behave in <HI>actual &s;ervice,</HI> however de&s;picable they may appear in their annual mu&s;ters.</P>
<P>Citizens of London, from the mo&s;t ancient times, were required to keep arms in their hou&s;es. The annual mu&s;|ter is rather a <HI>mu&s;ter of the arms</HI> than of <HI>the men,</HI> who would probably go out to
<PB N="54" REF="49">
<HI>actual</HI> &s;ervice, if there &s;hould be really occa&s;ion for them; but even the meane&s;t of <HI>the men,</HI> as they now are generally &s;ent out, (being for the mo&s;t part &s;ub&s;titutes,) if they were exerci&s;ed for a few hours three times a week, only for one month, and re&s;trained from the u&s;e of &s;trong li|quors during the time of exerci&s;e, would be found more &s;erviceable (if there was any real occa&s;ion of public defence) than is generally conceived.</P>
<P>Of this real facts afford the be&s;t proof: the irregularity of the Trained Bands and want of di&s;cipline were as con&s;picuous and notorious, it &s;eems, in the year 1642, as at pre&s;ent: for, when Capt. Skippon (afterwards Major-General) was directed by the parliament to attend them, as a guard, with two companies of the <HI>Trained Bands</HI> of London, Lord Clarendon's account of that matter is expre&s;&s;ed in the folloWing contemptuous terms; <Q>This man</Q> (&s;ays he, meaning Skippon)
<PB N="55" REF="50">
<Q>marched that day in the head of their <HI>TUMULTUARY ARMY</HI> to the parlia|ment-hou&s;e.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bk iv. p. 380.</NOTE> Yet Lord Clarendon him&s;elf makes ample reparation to the <HI>Trained Bands</HI> for this contempt, when he &s;peaks of their <HI>unexpected</HI> behaviour at the battle of Newbery; for, though he allows their <HI>inexperience both of danger and &s;ervice,</HI> he expre&s;&s;ly attributes to the <HI>&s;teadine&s;s</HI> of the Trained Bands the pre&s;er|vation of the parliament's army. No troops in the kingdom had at that time been able to with&s;tand the &s;pirited char|ges of Prince Rupert's well-di&s;ciplined hor&s;e, till this <HI>tumultuary army,</HI> (which &s;eems to be an exact de&s;cription al&s;o of their pre&s;ent mu&s;ters,) for the fir&s;t time, compelled them to wheel about.</P>
<P>Rapin &s;peaks of the brave defence of the <HI>infantry</HI> on that day in very high terms, but without mentioning what par|ticular troops they were; &s;o that no rea|der would &s;u&s;pect that he de&s;cribed the
<PB N="56" REF="51">
actions of the <HI>"tumultuary army"</HI> of the city.</P>
<P><Q>After the Prince had routed <HI>the ca|valry</HI> of the enemy,</Q> (&s;ays Rapin, meaning the <HI>parliament's cavalry,</HI>) <Q>he fell upon their <HI>infantry,</HI> which, though deprived of the help of the cavalry, received him with &s;o much <HI>intrepidity,</HI> that he was <HI>repul&s;ed</HI> &s;everal times, without being able ever to penetrate.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Apr&egrave;s avoir mis en deroute <HI>la Cavalerie</HI> des en|nemis, il alla tomber &s;ur leur <HI>Infanterie,</HI> qui, bien que d&eacute;nu&eacute;e du &s;ecours de la Cavalerie, le re&ccedil;ut avec tant d'intrepidi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&eacute;, qu'il fut repou&s;&s;&eacute; plu&s;ieurs fois, &s;ans qu'il p&ucirc;t jamais la percer.</Q> Rapin, tom. viii. p. 426.</NOTE> But Lord Clarendon candidly attributes the glory of the day to tho&s;e whom he before de&s;pi&s;ed as a <HI>tumultuary army.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"The London Trained Bands"</HI> (&s;ays he) <Q>and auxiliary regiments (of who&s;e <HI>IN|EXPERIENCE</HI> of <HI>DANGER,</HI> or <HI>ANY KIND OF SERVICE,</HI> beyond the ea&s;y practice of their po&s;tures in the Artil|lery-garden, men had till then <HI>TOO

For they &s;tood as a <HI>BULWARK AND RAMPIRE TO DEFEND THE REST;</HI></Q> (whereby he attributes to them the chief re&s;i&s;tance;) <Q>and, when their wings of hor&s;e were &s;cattered and di&s;per&s;ed, kept their ground <HI>SO STEA|DILY,</HI> that, though Prince Rupert him|&s;elf led up <HI>THE CHOICE HORSE</HI> to charge them, and endured their &s;torm of &s;mall &s;hot, he could make no impre&s;&s;ion upon their &s;tand of pikes, <HI>BUT WAS FORCED TO WHEEL ABOUT:</HI> of &s;o &s;overeign be|nefit and u&s;e is that readine&s;s, order, and dexterity, in the u&s;e of their arms, which hath been &s;o much neglected.</Q> Bk. VII. p. 347.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>City Pike-men</HI> are commend|ed as a &s;tandard pattern of military di&s;ci|pline, (viz. for their <Q>readine&s;s, order, and dexterity, in the u&s;e of arms,</Q>) by

the very &s;ame hi&s;torian who had entitled them <HI>a tumultuary army</HI> a very &s;hort time before this occa&s;ion which extorted his commendation. A moderate and &s;uffi|cient di&s;cipline, for real &s;ervice, is more ea&s;ily and &s;ooner acquired than people generally conceive; and nothing is want|ing to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment of City Trained Bands but more frequent mu&s;|ters, for about an hour or an hour and a half at a time, <HI>after the hours of labour:</HI> for, if they were allowed this advantage, they would be nearly upon the &s;ame foot|ing as the Militia of New England, Con|necticut, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which lately conquered the well-di&s;ciplined army of General Bur|goyne: they would be nearly upon the <HI>&s;ame footing,</HI> I &s;ay, except in one point; which is, that the <HI>New England Militia</HI> have always maintained the ancient con|&s;titutional right of choo&s;ing their own officers in the public <HI>Folkmotes:</HI> which the learned Judge Atkins, by the be&s;t autho|rities,

has proved to be the original con&s;ti|tution of our national Militia. Polit. Tracts, p. 254.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>county regiments of Militia</HI> &s;avours too much of a <HI>&s;tanding army,</HI> both in <HI>di&s;ci|pline,</HI> and <HI>the effect</HI> of the &s;ervice upon the <HI>common men;</HI> who, by being ab&s;ent too long a time from their families and ordinary occupations, are apt to become <HI>mere &s;oldiers,</HI> de&s;pi&s;ing their former trades and employments, and con&s;equently <HI>cea|&s;ing to be citizens.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Ab&s;olute will</HI> was al&s;o the e&s;&s;ential property of the &s;ucceeding empire, or the <HI>&s;econd bea&s;t; viz.</HI> the Medo-Per&s;ian monarchy, de&s;cribed el&s;ewhere under the figure of an impetuous <HI>ram,</HI> which pu&s;hed we&s;tward, and northward, and &s;outhward, <Q>&s;o that no <HI>BEASTS</HI> might &s;tand before him, neither (was there any) that could deliver out of his hand, but</Q> (the prophet now adds the principal <HI>be&s;tial,</HI> or <HI>brutal,</HI> mark) <Q>HE DID AC|CORDING TO HIS WILL, <HI>and became great.</HI></Q> (Dan. viii. 4.) For, after the Per&s;ian monarchs had once ac|quired the baneful <HI>"belluina pote&s;tas,"</HI> by the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of <HI>&s;tanding armies</HI> in every province, even the once-boa&s;ted <HI>laws of the Medes and Per&s;ians</HI> became as vague and uncertain as the <HI>royal will and plea&s;ure</HI> to which they were, of cour&s;e, &s;ubjected, how&s;oever <HI>un|changeable</HI> they might have been reputed in the com|mencement of that empire.</P>
<P>Neither was the <HI>third bea&s;t</HI> (the cruel <HI>four-headed fly|ing leopard</HI> of the Grecian empire) without the &s;ame characteri&s;tical mark of <HI>ab&s;olute will,</HI> though it is not expre&s;ly annexed to Daniel's de&s;cription of that com|pound of Tyranny in his &s;eventh chapter; but, in the farther de&s;cription of the Grecian empire, (chap. xi. v 3.) the &s;ame <HI>wilful</HI> or <HI>unlimited</HI> dominion is clearly foretold; <Q>A mighty king &s;hall &s;tand up, that &s;hall rule with great dominion,</Q> (and then follows the mark of the bea&s;t,) "<HI>and &s;hall do according to his</HI> WILL."</P>
<P>The king, mentioned in the 36th ver&s;e, that <Q>&s;hall do according to his <HI>WILL,</HI> and exalt him&s;elf, and magnify him&s;elf above every God,</Q> is generally under&s;tood to denote the <HI>fourth and la&s;t bea&s;t,</HI> or <HI>empire,</HI> which <HI>&s;till ex|i&s;ts;</HI> being that mo&s;t noxious and tremendous bea&s;t with <HI>iron teeth,</HI> (de&s;cribed in Dan. vii. 21.) <Q>which devour|ed, brake in pieces, and &s;tamped the re&s;idue under his feet;</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> in the mo&s;t violent and <HI>bea&s;tlike</HI> manner, which is plainly to "<HI>do according to his</HI> WILL!" We &s;ee then how aptly <HI>unlimited command,</HI> or <HI>merum impe|rium,</HI> is expre&s;&s;ed by the term, <HI>"belluina pote&s;tas."</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>unlimited will</HI> of a king is &s;o great an abomina|tion in the eye of the <HI>Engli&s;h Common-law,</HI> that the ex|erci&s;e of it in this country is declared to be an effectual di&s;qualification or aba&s;ement from the <HI>regal</HI> dignity, <Q>for there is <HI>NO KING,</HI> where <HI>WILL</HI> governs, and not law.</Q> &mdash; <Q>Non e&s;t enim rex, ubi dominatur <HI>VOLUNTAS,</HI> et non lex.</Q> (Bract lib. i. c. 8.)</P>
<P>A king of England <HI>cea&s;es to be king,</HI> when <HI>he cea&s;es to be limited by the</HI> LAW; for it is a rule of the com|mon-law, that <HI>"a king can do nothing" (i. e.</HI> by virtue of his office) <Q>on earth, while he is the mini&s;ter and vicar of God, except that alone which <HI>BY LAW</HI> he may.</Q> &mdash; <HI>"Nihil enim pote&s;t rex in terris,"</HI> &amp;c. <Q>ni&s;i id &s;olum quod de <HI>JURE</HI> pote&s;t,</Q> &amp;c. (See the note in pages 21 and 22.) And, therefore, when the law is <HI>&s;u&s;pend|ed,</HI> or &s;et a&s;ide, (which is the highe&s;t and mo&s;t bane|ful <HI>inju&s;tice,</HI>) the king's power cea&s;es to be <HI>"ae jure,"</HI> for, in the eye of the law, he is e&s;teemed <Q>Mini&s;ter di|aboli, dum declinet ad injuriam;</Q> &s;o that he and his mini&s;ters reduce them&s;elves thereby to the common level of all other bad men; and what&s;oever <HI>power,</HI> or <HI>force,</HI> in that ca&s;e they may be able to exert, has no better foundation than the temporary power of banditti, which may be lawfully and con&s;cientiou&s;ly re&s;i&s;ted by all men.</P>
<P>A king of England, therefore, though he is <HI>&s;upreme,</HI> (or <HI>&s;overeign,</HI>) in per&s;onal dignity and rank, yet he is <HI>not &s;o</HI> in will and power; becau&s;e, in the&s;e, the law (to avoid the <HI>belluina pote&s;tas</HI> of <HI>ab&s;olute monarchy</HI>) requires that he &s;hould be duly <HI>limited</HI> by the people: a nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction this, re&s;pecting <HI>&s;upremacy,</HI> of which the un|fortunate K. Cha. I. &s;eems not to have been aware, or he would not, with his dying breath, have denied the people's right to a <HI>&s;hare in the government;</HI> &s;aying,&mdash; <Q><HI>It is not for having &s;hare in government, &s;ir; that is nothing pertaining to them; a &s;ubject and a</HI> SOVEREIGN <HI>are clear different things,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;and &s;o they certainly are, with re&s;pect to <HI>per&s;onal dignity,</HI> or <HI>rank,</HI> when com|pared <HI>as individuals;</HI> and yet the <HI>&s;overeignty,</HI> or <HI>&s;upreme power,</HI> belongs of right to the people, i. e. to the ma|jority of them, or to the majority of their duly elected repre&s;entatives. <HI>"And therefore,"</HI> (we may &s;ay with that learned ca&s;ui&s;t, Bp Taylor, in his Ductor Dubi|tantium, lib. iii. c. rule 1, p. 522.) <Q>it is but a weak and u&s;ele&s;s di&s;tinction when we &s;peak of kings and princes, (by them meaning the <HI>SUPREME POWER,</HI>) to &s;ay that &s;ome are <HI>ABSOLUTE,</HI> &s;ome are <HI>LIMITED</HI> in their power.</Q> &mdash; That is, the di&s;tinction is weak and u&s;ele&s;s only when we mean to &s;peak of the <HI>&s;upreme power:</HI> this is clearly the bi&s;hop's meaning, as the following con|text will &s;hew; for otherwi&s;e the di&s;tinction to be made between <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> and <HI>limited "kings and princes"</HI> is &s;o far from being <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> that it is the nece&s;&s;ary and proper criterion between the <HI>illegal</HI> and <HI>legal</HI> dominion of kings; the <HI>limited</HI> alone being <HI>legal</HI> in this kingdom. <Q>For <HI>(the bi&s;hop adds)</HI> it is true that &s;ome princes are &s;o</Q> (i. e. <HI>are</HI> LIMITED <HI>in their power); "but then"</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>they "are</HI> NOT <HI>the</HI> SUPREME <HI>power."</HI> (This is directly to the point in que&s;tion; and he adds a farther illu&s;tration of it:) <Q>It is a contradiction <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> to &s;ay that the <HI>SUPREME POWER</HI> is limited or re&s;trained; for that which <HI>RE|STRAINS</HI> it is <HI>SUPERIOR</HI> to it, and therefore the other is <HI>NOT SUPREME.</HI></Q> That a king ought not to have the <HI>&s;upreme power</HI> is clearly laid down by the be&s;t wri|ters on the Engli&s;h <HI>Common Law;</HI> and particularly by Judge Bracton, one of the mo&s;t ancient as well as the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authorities. <Q>Rex &s;ub Deo et Lege. Rex habet <HI>SUPERIOREM,</HI> Deum, <HI>(&s;cilicet,)</HI> item <HI>LE|GEM,</HI> per quam factus e&s;t rex; item <HI>CURIAM SUAM,</HI> viz. comes, barones,</Q> &amp;c. Bract. lib. 2. c. xvi. p. 34. <HI>"Lex fraenum e&s;t potentiae,"</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a power of RESTRAINT is ve&s;ted in the LAW, as well as in the LEGISLATORS of this <HI>limited</HI> monarchy, is clearly proved by Mr. Acherley in his book on free parliaments. He argues from the words of the <HI>original writs of &s;ummons to parliament,</HI> &mdash; that the <HI>determining or deci&s;ive power,</HI> demanded by the &s;aid writs, (<HI>ad faciendum ea,</HI> i. e. the in&s;uperable and urgent bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es for which the parliament is called,) is <HI>derived from the people,</HI> and is <HI>independent;</HI> and his inference is good; and he gives a remarkable in&s;tance of this <HI>inde|pendent power in the people;</HI> which is their an&s;wer to the pope re&s;pecting the bani&s;hment of Adomar, Bp of Win|che&s;ter, in 1258. Ann 43. Hen, 3. Viz. <Q>Si dominus rex et regni majores hoc vellent, COMMUNITAS tamen ip&s;ius (Adomar) ingre&s;&s;um in Angliam jam nullatenus &s;u&s;tineret.</Q> <Q>That, if the king and lords would do this thing, (meaning, if they would revoke the bani&s;h|ment) <HI>yet the commons</HI> WOULD NOT SUFFER <HI>or bear Adomar's</HI> re&s;idence in England.</Q> <Q>And the commons cau&s;ed their &s;peaker, Petrus de Montford, <HI>'vice totius communitatis,'</HI> to &s;ign, and he did &s;ign, this an&s;wer.</Q> p. 9.</P>
<P>From this example, therefore, as well as from a great multitude of other in&s;tances of the power of the <HI>Engli&s;h commons,</HI> it is manife&s;t that there is <HI>no &s;upreme power</HI> in England without the concurrence and a&s;&s;ent of <HI>the peo|ple:</HI> not a <HI>general a&s;&s;ent,</HI> once for all, to throw <HI>the &s;upre|macy</HI> into other hands, but an <HI>e&s;pecial a&s;&s;ent</HI> for every new circum&s;tance that may be liable to affect their in|tere&s;t. For which cau&s;e, al&s;o, parliaments ought (indi&s;|pen&s;ably) to be newly elected <HI>every &s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> according to ancient u&s;age, i. e. <Q>every year once, and more often if need be</Q>; and that in as <HI>equal</HI> a proportion of <HI>repre&s;entation</HI> as po&s;&s;ible; becau&s;e, the more <HI>equitable</HI> in this point it is made, the more conducive it will &s;urely be to the happine&s;s and true permanent intere&s;t both of king and people.</P>
<P>But if, on the contrary, by the modern <HI>innovations</HI> of <HI>triennial</HI> and <HI>&s;eptennial</HI> elections, reduction of the right of voting, venality of almo&s;t depopulated boroughs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>&s;upreme power</HI> &s;hould be gradually corrupted, it mu&s;t become a <HI>&s;upreme</HI> evil to the de&s;truction of <HI>good government</HI> and <HI>peace!</HI> for, in &s;uch a corrupted &s;tate, nothing can thrive under it but <HI>&s;tanding armies,</HI> and that which always regularly attends their e&s;tabli&s;hment throughout all the branches of the fourth, or Roman, tyranny, I mean the <HI>belluina pote&s;tas</HI> of imperial <HI>will</HI> and <HI>command,</HI> again&s;t which the vengeance of the Al|mighty is clearly denounced; &s;o that tho&s;e per&s;ons, who yield them&s;elves in&s;truments to promote either the one or the other, are guilty of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t impiety!

<P>By the con&s;titution of this kingdom, as well as by many expre&s;s laws &s;till in force, <HI>apprentices, wards, and indeed lay|men, of all ranks and conditions, from fifteen to &s;ixty years of age,</HI> are required <HI>to have arms,</HI> and be duly <HI>exerci&s;ed</HI> in the u&s;e of them, for the national defence.

by the re&s;pective <HI>ward-a&s;&s;ociations,</HI> until the utility of the mea&s;ure is rendered ob|vious to the wards at large, that the hou&s;e-keepers at each wardmote maybe induced to adopt it. For, by the&s;e means, the hou&s;e-keepers might always have a &s;ufficient number of able and well-in&s;tructed <HI>&s;ub&s;ti|tutes, to &s;erve for them in the militia,</HI> which would thereby be re&s;cued from the oppro|brium of <HI>incapacity,</HI> with which it has &s;o frequently of late been charged; and the nece&s;&s;ity of any <HI>new reform of the City-Militia</HI> (which might be attended with very dangerous con&s;equences to the rights and liberties of citizens) would be there|by precluded. And if, in ca&s;e of any more tumults or riots, <HI>an armed City-watch</HI> &s;hould again be thought nece&s;&s;ary, the&s;e di&s;ciplined <HI>Militia-&s;ub&s;titutes in each ward</HI> might be enrolled in a <HI>Ro&s;ter</HI> for that particular &s;ervice, under the proper Militia-officers; and their attendance might be &s;o divided and dimini&s;hed, by
<PB N="83" REF="76">
a due <HI>Ro&s;ter,</HI> as to be very little burthen|&s;ome to the individuals enrolled; where|by a &s;mall &s;tipend to each, for the time of his actual attendance, would be &s;uffi|cient to render the &s;ervice <HI>voluntary.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or <HI>Volunteers</HI> might be invited, by rewarding a certain adequate proportion of <HI>watch-duty</HI> with the <HI>free|doms of the city;</HI> and by ordaining that no artificer or journeyman, employed in the city, be mole&s;ted as a <HI>Non-freeman,</HI> provided he enters him&s;elf a <HI>Volunteer</HI> on the watch-roll of the ward wherein he is employed.</NOTE></P>
<P>The appearance, al&s;o, of the City Mi|litia might be rendered more re&s;pectable, by the addition of <HI>drill-jackets,</HI> with &s;ome proper di&s;tinction of <HI>uniform facings,</HI> to denote the ward or di&s;trict of each com|pany.</P>
