<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of the Circle of Bavaria.</HEAD>
<P>BAVARIA not only contains the proper do|minions of the dukedom of that name, but al&s;o the territories of the Archbi&s;hop of Saltzburg, and the bi&s;hoprics of Pa&s;&s;au, Rati&s;bon, and Frie&s;engen. It is divided into Upper and Lower Bavaria, bounded by Franconia, Voitland and Bohemia, on the N. by Bohemia and Au&s;tria, E. Carinthia, Brixen and Ty|rol, to the S. and by Swabia on the W. extending about 200 miles from N. to S. and 120 from E. to W.</P>
<P>The Elector of Bavaria and the Archbi&s;hop of Saltzburg, are the joint &s;ummoning princes. Rati&s;|bon or Wa&s;&s;erburg are the two places where the diet of the circle is u&s;ually held, though &s;ometimes it is convened at Land&s;hut or Muldorf. The Elector is hereditary commander in chief, and has the direction
<PB N="4" REF="6">
of all military affairs. With re&s;pect to religion, this circle is one of the mixed.</P>
<P>Upper Bavaria is partly mountainous and woody, and partly mar&s;hy, abounding in large and &s;mall lakes, and, having a good deal of level ground, is fitter for pa&s;turage than tillage. Lower Bavaria is more level and more fruitful. But Bavaria in general abounds in grain, pa&s;tures, fore&s;ts, and plenty of cat|tle, game, and wild fowl. It produces al&s;o in differ|ent parts, &s;alt, copper, &s;ilver, lead, and marble, and here are medicinal &s;prings and baths. The Danube, which has its &s;cource in Swabia, waters the electorate from ea&s;t to we&s;t, receiving other rivers in its cour&s;e. Out of the Danube and two other rivers, a &s;mall quantity of &s;and is collected. There are &s;ixteen large inland lakes, and 160 &s;mall ones, all which afford a number of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>In all Bavaria are reckoned thirty-five cities, and ninety-five open and enclo&s;ed market-towns, 1000 ca&s;tles and &s;eats, or e&s;tates inve&s;ted with lower town juri&s;diction over the va&s;&s;als, and 11,704 villages, ham|lets, and de&s;arts, which la&s;t alone are computed at 4000. In the Upper Palatinate are thirteen cities and twenty-eight market-towns. The computation of va&s;&s;als or families in the electorate, which e&s;timates them at four millions, and tho&s;e in Bavaria alone at near 3,400,000, exceeds the truth, as this would
<PB N="5" REF="7">
make the number of people 24,000,000, they do not amount to more than one million and a half, and the income of the Duke is 1,000,000l. &s;terling.</P>
<P>In Bavaria no other religious doctrine is tolerated than the Roman-catholic. The pari&s;hes in the elec|torate are about 1500, the vicarages and chapels near 2000, and the number of churches, it is &s;aid, amount to 28,709. The remarkable convents are eighty-&s;ix, and the collegiate foundations twelve.</P>
<P>Solid knowledge and good learning mu&s;t be owned, to the honour of this electorate, to be on a better footing, and to receive more countenance here now than ever. The Benedictines di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in both, and Ingold&s;tadt boa&s;ts a univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>Manufactures are al&s;o encouraged and improved here, particularly coar&s;e cloths, woollen &s;tuffs, and &s;tockings, &s;ilk &s;tuffs, velvets, tape&s;try, good clocks, watches, and other nece&s;&s;aries, though its chief ex|ports con&s;i&s;t of cattle, grain, wood, &s;alt, and iron. At Munich, from &s;pring to June, is brewed a kind of white beer, called ambock, very &s;trong, and &s;ome|thing like fine Engli&s;h ale, but won't keep. The monopoly of this liquor brings in yearly above a mil|lion of guilders.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">Agriculture here is at a very low ebb; not more than half the country is in tenure, or occupancy, and fallows are kept open three, four, or five years to &s;trengthen the &s;oil, e're they &s;ow the land for a crop.</P>
<P>The title of the Elector is, "By the grace of God, Duke of Upper and Lower Bavaria, as al&s;o the Up|per Palatinate, Pfal&s;grave of the Rhine, Arch-&s;teward of the Holy Roman Empire, and Landgrave of Leuchtenberg." The arms are quarterly, an e&s;cut|cheon of pretence; in one, a topaz in a field ruby, in another, a lion ruby, crowned topaz, and in the other two lozenges, &s;apphire and pearl.</P>
<P>There are five hereditary &s;tate-officers in this elec|torate; that of the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;hold has been ve&s;ted in the Barons Ha&s;iangs, &s;ince 1618, and they have been amba&s;&s;adors at the court of London for many years. The knights of the Bavarian order of <HI>St. George,</HI> mu&s;t produce unque&s;tionable proofs of their nobility for eight generations back in both lines. Its en&s;ign is a blue enamelled cro&s;s with a <HI>St. George</HI> in the middle, worn pendant to a broad &s;ky blue rib|band, with a black and white border, and a &s;tar on the brea&s;t. The military force of the Elector con&s;i&s;ts of regulars and militia; the former, in time of peace, amounts only to 12,000, in war to 30,000.</P>

<P><PB N="7" REF="10">Of the cities, we &s;hall &s;peak only of Munich, Salt&s;burg, Rati&s;bon, Pa&s;&s;au, and Ingold&s;tadt. Munich is a fortified city, &s;eated on the I&s;er, and the capital and re&s;idence of the Elector.</P>
<P>Rati&s;bon and Munich are the principal cities, but the latter is con&s;idered as the capital. It is plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the river I&s;ar, which, divided into &s;everal channels, waters all parts of the town, &s;o that little &s;treams run through many of the &s;treets, confined in &s;tone channels, which have a mo&s;t clean and agree|able effect. The &s;treets, &s;quares, and courts are &s;pa|cious and airy, which make all the buildings appear more magnificent than tho&s;e in other cities, which have been built with much more co&s;t and expence. The &s;treets in particular are &s;o &s;traight, that many of them inter&s;ect each other at right angles, and are very broad and extremely well built. The &s;plendour and beauty of its buildings, both public and private, e&s;pecially the electoral palace, may compare with any in Europe. The magnificence of the churches and convents are &s;uch, that they are equal, if not &s;upe|rior to any in Germany.</P>
<P>The electoral palace is not &s;o noble an edifice out|wardly, as its internal beauty demands. This va&s;t &s;tructure being built at various periods by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive princes, &s;everal fancies were indulged in the ta&s;te of it; and it has many valuable paintings, and the Duke
<PB N="8" REF="11">
of Marlborough, after the battle of Hoch&s;tet, brought away a great many to England.</P>
<P>It is &s;eated at the extremity of the town, and contains 2060 windows, twenty large halls, eleven courts, nine galleries, &s;ixteen kitchens, and twelve cellars. It is thought to be one of the mo&s;t magnifi|cent, large, and commodious palaces in Europe, and of the four principal courts, one is adorned with &s;everal bra&s;s &s;tatues; another, the Emperor's, is &s;o con&s;tructed, that combats of wild bea&s;ts may be exhibited in it. In the kitchen-court, which is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arge&s;t, at the nuptials of an elector, a very magni|ficent tournament was held. The a&s;cent from the Emperor's court to the hall, is a flight of wide and beautiful red marble-&s;teps. The hall is 118 feet long, and fifty-two wide. In it &s;tands a &s;tatue of Vir|tue made of one &s;ingle piece of porphyry; here is al&s;o a bath, con&s;i&s;ting of a grotto, and three rooms, a mu&s;eum, a chamber of curio&s;ities, and a noble li|brary.</P>
<P>In the mu&s;eum are &s;ome hundred &s;tatues and bu&s;ts of the old Roman emperors, with 500 other antiques, as lamps, in&s;criptions, ba&s;&s;o relievos, &amp;c. mo&s;t of which were brought from Italy. Among other things to exerci&s;e curio&s;ity, is a &s;mall &s;tatue of bra&s;s, weigh|ing &s;eventy odd pounds, and yet hardly to be lifted by the &s;tronge&s;t man, unle&s;s he places him&s;elf &s;o as
<PB N="9" REF="12">
to give it a certain equilibrium, but by advancing the left foot before the &s;tatue, it is &s;o ea&s;ily managed, as to be lifted up, without any effect, by a &s;ingle fin|ger put into the hole. In the Elector's trea&s;ury, &s;hewn by his fir&s;t gentlemen of the bed-chamber, are a number of valuable articles, that have but few equals in all Europe, as, 1. A hill with a ca&s;tle on it, all of oriental pearls. 2. Several ve&s;&s;els of green ja&s;|per. 3. A cabinet of many large pieces of chry&s;tal work; among the re&s;t, a &s;hip, &s;ome &s;pans long, the pilot, and all the tackling of the pure&s;t gold. 4. A large lagule bowl. 5. Patterns of a gold &s;ervice of the fine&s;t gold, for three large tables, and in mort|gage at Au&s;burg. 6. A ruby, as large as a walnut. 7. <HI>St. George,</HI> on hor&s;eback, cut from a fine piece of red agate, his armour of diamonds, &s;et in gold. 8. A double brilliant diamond, the &s;ize of a middling nut. 9. A larger, which co&s;t 100,000 guilders. 10. A &s;et of buttons and loops of diamonds, with rubies &s;et between. 11. A like &s;et of diamonds only, the but|tons of exceeding beauty, and in &s;ize not inferior to tho&s;e which were worn by <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. when he gave public audience to the Per&s;ian Amba&s;&s;ador, and of a &s;uperior lu&s;tre to the French, having been twenty years in collecting, and at an incredible ex|pence. 12. The images of the Bavarian family, in blue chalcedony. 13. An ivory clo&s;et, of uncommon curious workman&s;hip, containing 1144 gold Roman medals.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">Near a wall in one of the palace courts, is a large black &s;tone, with the following in&s;cription on it, "In 1409, the illu&s;trious Duke <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> the renowned hero of Bavaria, lifted this large &s;tone, weighing 340 lb. and threw it to &s;ome di&s;tance." A Bavarian country girl &s;ome few years &s;ince rai&s;ed this &s;tone a hand high from the ground. Near the &s;ame place are al&s;o three iron nails driven into the wall, with this in&s;cription: "Let every leaper behold with wonder the&s;e three nails; the fir&s;t of which is twelve feet from the ground, and indicates a leap of the noble Duke <HI>Chri&s;topher;</HI> the &s;econd nail, which is ten feet and a half, was reached by <HI>Zundritt;</HI> the third, though but nine feet and a half, &s;hews the activity of <HI>Philip Springer.</HI> He who can outdo the&s;e leaps, let him try."</P>
<P>Count <HI>Prei&s;ing,</HI> ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, has built op|po&s;ite to the palace, a hotel, the four &s;ides of which an&s;wer to &s;o many &s;treets, and is a great ornament to the city. The pillars of his &s;table are red marble, and every hor&s;e feeds out of a particular marble of twenty-five guilders value.</P>
<P>The cathedral church of our lady has two large towers, contains twenty-five chapels, thirty altars, and twenty-four large columns. Not far from one of the doors, is a &s;tone, with a mark on it; and to him who &s;tands there, the multitude of pillars takes away the &s;ight of every window of the church, of cour&s;e the
<PB N="11" REF="14">
church is rather dark. It has a large organ of box wood, and a &s;tately black marble monument of the Emperor <HI>Lewis,</HI> of Bavaria, with &s;ix large, and &s;eve|ral le&s;&s;er &s;tatues of bra&s;s.</P>
<P>The palace and other electoral buildings, together with the brew-hou&s;es, 16 mona&s;teries, churches, and other religious &s;tructures, take up near half of the city; the precinct of the Augu&s;tines alone, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;eve|ral &s;treets, which bring them in an annual rent of 3000 guilders.</P>
<P>The Elector's court is very numerous and &s;plendid. The late elector had thirty-&s;ix lords of the bed-cham|ber, (I am &s;peaking now from <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> who was there about &s;ixty years ago). The &s;ame elector kept 1200 or 1400 hor&s;es; his &s;ucce&s;&s;or was contented with 700, but &s;ixty-five footmen are kept in con&s;tant pay. At the court of Bavaria, from its numerous family and alliances with the Imperial hou&s;e, there are no le&s;s than thirty-three &s;tate fe&s;tivals, and the&s;e are increa|&s;ing; but at the fe&s;tival of <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti,</HI> there is a proce&s;&s;ion of &s;everal thou&s;and per&s;ons; deputies of all trades and handicrafts a&s;&s;i&s;t at it, with co&s;tly flags carried before them; the &s;ame is done al&s;o by the re|ligious orders, every member of which joins the pro|ce&s;&s;ion. All manner of religious hi&s;tories are exhi|bited on a great number of triumphal cars, by child|ren, richly dre&s;&s;ed. At the head of their re&s;pective
<PB N="12" REF="15">
fraternities, ride St. <HI>George</HI> and St. <HI>Maurice,</HI> in Ro|man habits. St. <HI>Maurice</HI> is repre&s;ented by a young lady, in the attire of a Roman ve&s;tal, leading after her a large dragon, in which two men are enclo&s;ed, to give it the nece&s;&s;ary movements. The four men|dicant orders precede the venerable ho&s;t, carried un|der a &s;plendid canopy. Immediately after rides the Elector in per&s;on, and his con&s;ort on his left, both holding a lighted taper. Next to the Electre&s;s comes her ma&s;ter of the hou&s;hold, followed by &s;ome court ladies, and after the&s;e, the whole court, dre&s;&s;ed after the Spani&s;h fa&s;hion. The &s;treets are boarded, &s;trew|ed with flowers and herbs, and the proce&s;&s;ion la&s;ts an hour and a half.</P>
<P>The late elector was immoderately fond of hunt|ing, and the electre&s;s was &s;o fond of him, that &s;he entered into the &s;pirit of his amu&s;ement. She &s;hot very well, and at hunting, made nothing of tram|pling up to her knees in a mora&s;s. Her dre&s;s was a green coat, and a little fair wig. She was extreme|ly fond of dogs, particularly the Engli&s;h grey-hounds, they were always with her in her be&s;t apartment, and &s;urrounded her in bed and at table. At their hunt|ing &s;eat, the electre&s;s's bed-chamber was under the elector's, had a kennel in one corner, and a much larger one in a fine clo&s;et adjoining. The complexi|on of the court ladies vi&s;ibly &s;uffered from their at|tendance on her in all weathers. There goes a &s;tory,
<PB N="13" REF="16">
that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. &s;aid, je&s;ting, to Baron <HI>Freybzerg,</HI> the Elector's great hunt&s;man, which is a &s;tate officer in Bavaria, concerning a bitch, which the Elector parti|cularly valued; "I am told your bitch often lo&s;es &s;cent of the game," to which the Baron, piqued at a reflection on the flower of his pack, warmly re|plied, "How!&mdash;She's as true as the go&s;pel."</P>
<P>They have here a remedy for the bite of a mad dog, which the late elector him&s;elf often made u&s;e of with &s;ucce&s;s for his officers, and once for one of the chief prince&s;&s;es of the court, <HI>viz.</HI> to make the patient eat the raw liver of the dog that did the mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P>The chapel of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> is fini&s;hed with every &s;pecies of riches, &s;uch as gold, &s;ilver, and pre|cious &s;tones; nor does it want for its &s;hare of relicks, for the religious pretend to have a good part of the &s;kirt of the mohair gown which the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> wore, when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was crucified!&mdash;Be this at it may, yet it is certain, the mo&s;t profound veneration is paid to this choice piece of an old garment.</P>
<P>In the large&s;t market-place &s;tands a marble pillar, with a bra&s;s &s;tatue of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> upon it, and two large fountains on each &s;ide; fronting of which is the town-hou&s;e, a very elegant building, with a great number of hieroglific paintings on the front.</P>

<P>Of the general maxims or leading principles of the people of this court, we can &s;ay but little. Immedi|ate &s;elf-intere&s;t is apparently the pur&s;uit of every one; or if they do profe&s;s any principles, they are cer|tainly the mo&s;t pliant and ver&s;atile in the world. In|deed, if we may judge by the way of thinking of in|feriors, many of the principal people have adopted the mo&s;t execrable theory in politics; for in&s;tance, that religion &s;erves only for the purpo&s;e of keeping the crowd of mankind &s;laves to them. That a cour|tier mu&s;t put on the externals of religion, but leave the practice to the vulgar. That men are by nature wicked, &s;editious, turbulent, and only to be go|verned by being kept in perpetual &s;ervitude, and not being permitted to u&s;e their faculties. Finally, that too much knowledge is dangerous, and that the great hold their rights over their people from God, and are no ways accountable for their conduct, nor under any obligation to their &s;ubjects. Every thing here is venal.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">A few years ago, a certain mini&s;ter of this court would have &s;old half Bavaria to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, if the Pru&s;&s;ian and Ru&s;&s;ian courts, and the mini&s;ter of the court of Deux-Ponts, had not prevented the purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>In every project propo&s;ed, a &s;mall part only is in|tended for any good purpo&s;e; the greater part has the intere&s;t of the projector in view.</P>
<P>Every thing here is calculated for &s;hew&punc; and as a &s;pecimen, the court keeps a great admiral for two or three ve&s;&s;els on the Rhine.

<P>Here there are no pains taken to correct the people from their inclination to theft and robbery, by good education, improved morals, and encouragement to indu&s;try. Sumptuous places of public amu&s;ements, expen&s;ive collections of curio&s;ities, palaces, gardens, and innumerable &s;warms of glittering &s;ervants, are the only fa&s;hionable errors to be acquired. Prie&s;ts, and the frail &s;i&s;terhood, lead the higher cla&s;&s;es into all the &s;lavi&s;h &s;hackles of vice, folly, and exce&s;s. Or, in the words of <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> "&s;ince the time that a Ca|puchined daemon has had &s;ufficient influence in the direction of the Bavarian politics, to mi&s;lead the go|vernment, little el&s;e than anarchy and confu&s;ion have pervaded the political &s;y&s;tem of this &s;tate."</P>
<P>A picture of the Bavarian character and manners, by <HI>Hogarth,</HI> was he now living, would be extremely intere&s;ting. Great &s;ingularity of character is often to be met with in England; but what Bavaria offers, ex|ceeds any thing to be &s;een el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The Bavarian men in general are &s;tout bodied, mu&s;cular and fle&s;hy. The women extremely hand|&s;ome, well &s;haped, and lively in conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="20">The characteri&s;tic, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> of a Bavarian man, is a very thick round head, a little peaked chin, a large belly, and a pale complexion. Many of them look like caricatures of man, they have great fat bel|lies, &s;hort clubbed feet, narrow &s;houlders, and &s;hort necks. They are heavy and aukward in their carri|age, and their &s;mall eyes betray a great deal of rogue|ry. The women are &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful crea|tures in the world, rather gro&s;s, but their &s;kin &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es all the carnation ever u&s;ed by painters, the pure&s;t lily white is &s;oftly tinged with purple, as if by the hands of the graces. Some of the pea&s;ant girls have &s;uch clear complexions, as to appear quite tran&s;|parent. They are well &s;haped, and more lively and graceful in their ge&s;tures than the men. The pea|&s;ants wives, of Weild, eight leagues from Munich, wear broad felt hats or bonnets, with a &s;mall knob behind, towards the neck, no bigger than a walnut. On holidays, the maids of the principal inns and public-hou&s;es at Munich, wear about their necks, a &s;ilver chain, of three rows, and their brea&s;ts are al&s;o laced with two &s;uch other chains; a piece of finery, that co&s;ts them fifty guilders.</P>
<P>In the capital, they dre&s;s in the French &s;tyle, or, at lea&s;t, they imagine that they do &s;o, for the men are &s;till too fond of gold and mixed colours. The coun|try gentry, dre&s;s without any ta&s;te at all. The chief ornament of the men, is a long, broad wai&s;tcoat,
<PB N="18" REF="21">
&s;trangely embroidered, from which their breeches hang very low and loo&s;e, probably to give free play to their bellies, which is the chief part of a Bavarian. The women di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves with a &s;ort of &s;tays in the &s;hape of a funnel, which cover the brea&s;t and &s;houlders, &s;o as to hide the whole neck. This &s;tiff dre&s;s is covered with &s;ilver beads, and thickly overlaid with &s;ilver chains. In many places the hou&s;ewife has a bunch of keys and a knife, appendant to a girdle, which reach almo&s;t to the ground.</P>
<P>As to the characters and manners of the Bavarians, the inhabitants of the capital naturally differ very much from the country people. The manners of the people of Munich are corrupt, as mu&s;t be the ca&s;e with 40,000 men, depending entirely upon a court's growing generally idle at its expence.</P>
<P>Among the great nobles here met with, as well as el&s;ewhere, there are &s;ome very well-bred and polite per&s;ons, but the people in general, taking the words in their full extent, are in a high degree de&s;titute of every &s;en&s;e of honour, without education, without any attachment to the con&s;titution, or generous feel|ing whatever. The fortunes of this place are from 1500 to three or four thou&s;and pounds a year, but the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors know no other u&s;e for their money, than to &s;pend it in &s;en&s;ual gratifications. Many good hou&s;es have been ruined by play. The fa&s;hionable

game at court was formerly called <HI>zwicken,</HI> or <HI>perich,</HI> but &s;ince <HI>Hambe&s;ch,</HI> the mini&s;ter of Finance, has pinched their &s;alaries &s;o much, they call it <HI>hambe&s;ch.</HI> Many of the court ladies know no other employ, than playing with their parrots, their dogs, or their cats. One of the principal ladies, whom I was acquainted with, &s;ays Baron <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> kept a hall full of cats, and two or three maids to attend them; &s;he conver&s;ed half the day long with them, often &s;erved them her&s;elf with coffee and &s;ugar, and dre&s;&s;ed them, according to her fancy, differently every day.</P>
<P>The little noble&s;&s;e and &s;ervants of the court, have &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion for titles, as is to be pitied. Before the pre&s;ent Elector came here, the place &s;warmed with excellencies, honourable and right honourable. The Emperor made an order to a&s;certain the different ranks of noble&s;&s;e; all tho&s;e whom it deprived of titles, and, particularly the women, &s;unk into de|&s;pair, and, for the fir&s;t time, complaints were made of tyranny, of which none before &s;eemed to have any conception.</P>
<P>The remainder of the inhabitants are immer&s;ed in the mo&s;t &s;candalous debauch; every night the &s;treets re-echo with the noi&s;e of drunkards, i&s;&s;uing from the numerous taverns, where they have open revelling and dancing. Whoever is at all noble here, mu&s;t keep his mi&s;tre&s;s, and the re&s;t indulge in promi&s;cuous

love. In this re&s;pect, things are not much better in the country; &s;o that Bavaria well de&s;erves the charac|ter given of it, by an officer of Ga&s;cony, of being the greate&s;t brothel in the world.</P>
<P>The country people are extremely dirty; a few miles di&s;tant from the capital, one would hardly take the hovels of the pea&s;ants for the habitations of men. Many of them have large puddles before their doors, and are obliged to &s;tep over planks into them. The thatched roofs of the country, in many parts of France; have a much better appearance than the wretched huts of the Bavarian pea&s;ants, the roofs of which are covered with &s;tones, in order that the &s;lates may not be carried away by the wind. Mean as this looks; cheap as nails are here, and often as half the roof are torn away by &s;trong winds, yet cannot the rich far|mer be per&s;uaded to nail his &s;hingles properly toge|ther. In &s;hort, from the court to the &s;malle&s;t cottage, indolence is the mo&s;t predominant part of the cha|racter of the Bavarian.</P>
<P>As I &s;trolled, continues the &s;ame author, through the country, I &s;huddered at the &s;ight of the ravages which war had made. There is no town of any im|portance throughout all Bavaria, but the capital. You would never imagine what pitiful little holes Land&s;|berg, Wa&s;&s;erberg, Land&s;hut, and many other places are, which make a great figure in the map. To al

appearance, neither Ingold&s;tadt nor Shaubingen, or any of the greater towns, except Munich, contains above 4000 people. Excepting the brewer, baker, and innkeeper, you may &s;eek in vain for a rich trade&s;man. There is not a ve&s;tige of indu&s;try either in town or country, but every body &s;eems to con&s;ider idlene&s;s and beggary as the happie&s;t &s;tate of man.</P>
<P>The country people and farmers are divided into four cla&s;&s;es; into whole, half, and quarter-farmers, and into tho&s;e called <HI>hau&s;ler.</HI> The whole farmers plough with eight hor&s;es, and are termed <HI>einliedler,</HI> that is, hermits, becau&s;e their farm-hou&s;es are at a di&s;tance from any cottage. Many of the&s;e farm-hou&s;es command a territory of three miles in length and breadth, and the owners employ from ten to fif|teen hor&s;es in their tillage, reckoning two hor&s;es to every plough. Of &s;uch farmers, there may be about 40,000. A half-farmer ploughs with four, and a quarter-farmer, with two hor&s;es. The <HI>hau&s;ler</HI> are day labourers to the re&s;t, and till their bit of property with cattle belonging to others. Having no idea of meadow land or &s;tall-food for cattle, the farmers ex|cu&s;e their ignorance and inattention to it, by pleading the want of manure. In a word, both court and peo|ple &s;eem blind to their own intere&s;t, and a &s;lothful indolence pervades the whole nation.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="25">This great indolence is contra&s;ted in an extraordi|nary manner, with a &s;till higher degree of bigotry, as was before ob&s;erved, and a &s;tory of the facetious baron will exemplify the appellation. "I happened (&s;ays he) to &s;troll into a dark, filthy beer hou&s;e, in the outlets of Munich, where, on my entrance, I beheld a cloud of &s;moke, but as &s;oon as the vapour was a little cleared, I could di&s;cern a loud company of the lower order of the people headed by a drunk|en prie&s;t. His black coat was bedaubed with grea&s;e and filth, having many appertures in its fabrick, and, in either hand, emblems of his devotion, that is to &s;ay, cards in the one, and a jug of ale in the other. After the a&s;&s;embly were tolerably plied with &s;trong drink, the &s;un-&s;hine of conviviality gave way to the &s;torms of inebriety, and pots, bottles, and gla&s;&s;es flew thick at each others heads. Pre&s;ently the even|ing bell rang for prayers, when off went their bonnets, and down fell the company on their knees, repeating <HI>Ave Maria, Pater no&s;ter, &amp;c.</HI> After prayers, they aro&s;e, with determined re&s;olution, to end the di&s;pute by the aid of mugs and gla&s;&s;es, upon which I thought it high time to decamp, as I fore&s;aw there might be danger to be within reach of the things in motion; and perceiving the prie&s;t took a lower &s;eat, as he thru&s;t in his weighty carca&s;e, under the table, for &s;helter, lea&s;t one of the bottles &s;hould come in con|tact with his noddle."</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26">The &s;ame &s;cenes occur in the inland towns among the citizens, officers, clergymen, and &s;tudents. They all &s;alute each other with abu&s;ive language, all vie in hard drinking, and clo&s;e to every church, there is regularly a brew-hou&s;e and a brothel. A &s;tudent of the univer&s;ity of Ingold&s;tadt, mu&s;t carry a thick cud|gel, and wear a neat cut hat, he mu&s;t be able to drink from eight to ten quarts of beer at a &s;itting, and be always ready to fight, right or wrong, with the offi|cers of the garri&s;on. No pen, continues <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> can de&s;cribe the ridiculous mixtures of debauchery and devotion, which every day happen. The mo&s;t notori|ous is that which took place in the church of St. <HI>Mary Oettingen,</HI> a few years &s;ince, when a prie&s;t ac|tually deflowered a girl whom he had long pur&s;ued, and could only make a prize of there, before the altar of the Virgin.</P>
<P>The country people join to their indolence and devotion a certain ferocity of temper, which often gives ri&s;e to bloody &s;cenes; when they mean to prai&s;e a church holiday, or &s;ome public fe&s;tival, which has lately been kept, they &s;ay.&mdash;It was a charming day, there were &s;ix or eight per&s;ons killed, and many bro|ken legs and arms. If no accident happened, they call it a fiddle-faddle bu&s;ine&s;s, a mere nothing. In the beginning of this century, the Bavarian troops maintained the fir&s;t reputation among the German forces. At the battle of Hoch&s;tadt, they kept their

ground, and conceived them&s;elves victors, till the Elector, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed them, was informed that the French had given way on the other wing. Under <HI>Tilly</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> they did wonders, but &s;ince the time of tho&s;e generals, military di&s;cipline has &s;o far relaxed among&s;t them, that they are no longer &s;oldiers. No people can &s;hew more abhorrence to every th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> that is called di&s;cipline and order, than the Bav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ians do: they might, however, &s;till be u&s;eful as fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e booters, where robberies and di&s;orders are more pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">onable than tho&s;e of regular troops. There are band<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of robbers about, one thou&s;and men &s;trong, and would, undoubtedly, make good &s;couting parties in time of war. There have been in&s;tances of oppo&s;ing the military, under bold leaders, to the very la&s;t man. But the poore&s;t pea&s;ants con&s;ider it as a hard&s;hip to be drafted into the regular troops of his prince.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the capital are very timid and &s;ub&s;ervient, but the unadulterated Bavarian pea&s;ant is gro&s;s, fat, dirty, lazy, drunken and undi&s;ciplined, economical and patriotic, yet he is brave, and &s;uch a &s;lave to his word, that when he has once given it, it is never to be broken. The imitative zeal is &s;ingu|larly &s;trong in the&s;e people, for whatever character the Elector a&s;&s;umes, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, they are religiou&s;ly devoted to its ob&s;ervance.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="28">It is the religious contagion only that unfits the na|tives of this circle, from tho&s;e proper exerci&s;es in life, that could tend to the advancement both of their credit and fortune. Monks are the directors of tem|poral concerns as well as &s;piritual di&s;cipline. They alone are to be thanked for that wildne&s;s of manners u&s;ual among the Bavarians. Their cowls contain the e&s;&s;ence of chri&s;tianity and all morality. They preach nothing but ma&s;&s;es, which are profitable to them, and the ro&s;ary, the &s;capulaire, and ridiculous morti|fication of the body, are the means by which many blockheads have got the name of &s;aints.</P>
<P>Thus the deceived layman believes, that confe&s;&s;ion and a ma&s;s, which only co&s;ts fifteen pence, will wipe away the foule&s;t &s;ins, and con&s;iders the telling of his beads, as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential duty of this life.</P>
<P>The &s;ecular prie&s;ts are as few in number, as the monks are many. The&s;e ought naturally to form the manners of the country; but they are held in much le&s;s veneration than the others, becau&s;e their dre&s;s and appearance is not &s;o extraordinary. In Bavaria, however, they do not de&s;erve more re&s;pect than the monks, for though their pari&s;hes are four miles in compa&s;s, and producing from four to 600l. a year, the greater part of them differ only from the pea&s;ants, by wearing a black coat, keeping a more expen&s;ive table, and a hand&s;omer and better dre&s;&s;ed hou&s;e-keeper:

In other things they are equally lazy, unlearned and ignorant.</P>
<P>The air of this electorate is con&s;idered as very &s;a|lubrious, for, notwith&s;tanding the incon&s;iderate mode of living pur&s;ued by the generality of people here, few die of epidemical di&s;tempers; health and longe|vity being the di&s;tingui&s;hed characteri&s;tics of this fa|voured country.</P>
<P>Near Munich is a town called Reichen-hall, re|markable for its curious &s;alt &s;pring, the water of which worked by a mill, has a wheel thirty-&s;ix feet in diameter, which, by means of a chain-pump, rai&s;es the fluid into a re&s;ervoir, and thence into pipes for the di&s;tance of fifteen Engli&s;h miles, over a lofty mountain, to a &s;alt-hou&s;e, where fuel is con|venient, and there it is boiled. On the mountains over which it pa&s;&s;es, there are little hou&s;es, at proper di&s;tances, in order to throw the water higher; for the conveyance al&s;o of a &s;trong fre&s;h &s;pring u&s;ed in turning the wheels and other engines, and likewi&s;e for carry|ing off any &s;uperfluous &s;alt water, there is a mo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hing and durable aqueduct of &s;quare flints, three Engli&s;h miles in length, and five feet broad, with an arched roof, being made upwards of 300 years, at a va&s;t expence.

It likewi&s;e extends over the Bavarian di&s;tricts of Holnberg in the Upper Palatinate, as al&s;o over the Roman-catholic pari&s;hes, in the princi|pality of Sulzbach, the Landgravate of Leuthtenberg, and the county of Hern&s;tein.

about &s;ixty miles N. of Munich, and the like di&s;tance W. of Pa&s;&s;au.

large contraband trade. Indeed they conceive that what they lo&s;e by this, is more than an equivalent for what they gain by the diet in other re&s;pects. The fact is, that the amba&s;&s;adors, from the greate&s;t pow|ers, who have large incomes, and &s;eem to be paid for holding great &s;tate, hold none; and as the other mini&s;ters regulate them&s;elves by their example, one may be &s;everal weeks in town, without knowing that the diet is a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the diet is very tedious, owing to the prevalence of party on all great occa&s;ions. The diet, as has been ob&s;erved, con&s;i&s;ts of three colleges, the electoral, the prince's, and the &s;tates. All a&s;&s;em|ble in a hall to receive the Emperor's propo&s;itions, thence they retire to &s;eparate apartments to di&s;cu&s;s the bu&s;ine&s;s. The majority decides in each chamber, and &s;o does the majority of the three colleges, as to the determination of the whole. When they are de|termined, it is laid before the Emperor, or his prin|cipal commi&s;&s;ary. The fir&s;t college has nine voices; the &s;econd one hundred; and that of the &s;tates fifty|one.</P>
<P>The Imperial court has great influence in all the three colleges. The three eccle&s;ia&s;tical electors have been almo&s;t con&s;tantly creatures of the Emperor, who &s;pares neither gold threats nor promi&s;es to in&s;pire the canons of Mentz, Treves, and Cologne, in the choice
<PB N="32" REF="35">
of a new archbi&s;hop. The Emperor has the &s;ame weight in the college of princes; almo&s;t all the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical princes are his true &s;ons; be&s;ides, it has always been the maxim of the Imperial court to rai&s;e the members of the hereditary dominion, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;malle&s;t fief in the empire, to the dignity of princes, in order to give them a &s;eat in the diet. In the college of towns or &s;tates, he rules almo&s;t without controul, for as the&s;e are almo&s;t all encompa&s;&s;ed by mo&s;t powerful princes, they require the particular pro|tection of the court of Vienna, to prevent their being totally cru&s;hed. But it being enacted, that the majority in the Imperial colleges &s;hall not be deci&s;ive either in religion or tho&s;e matters, in which the &s;tates could not be con&s;idered as one body, or where the catholics are of one, and the prote&s;tants of another opinion; in &s;uch ca&s;es the colleges divide into parties, and how|ever &s;mall in number one party may be, its decree is held equal to the other more numerous one. Thus the Emperor is &s;ometimes oppo&s;ed by the prote&s;tants, and the Roman-catholics have found a benefit in it. Though Saxony has the apparent government of the prote&s;tant party, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's power is got to that pitch as to be at the head of the party, and he often prote&s;ts vehemently again&s;t things in which religion is not the lea&s;t concerned.</P>
<P>The principal Imperial commi&s;&s;ioner who is at the head of the diet, by virtue of his office, takes place
<PB N="33" REF="36">
of all the emperors, amba&s;&s;adors, and others, except only the envoy from the court of Rome, being here the repre&s;entation of the head of the German empire. He returns no vi&s;its, nor does he give the title of <HI>Excellence</HI> to any of the envoys, not even to tho&s;e of the electors. When an envoy from an electoral prince pays him a vi&s;it, he orders him to be received at his coach-door by four gentlemen, two pages and a har|binger, and meets him at the door of the &s;econd anti-chamber, walking back, a little before, on the right hand of the envoy. The &s;ame &s;uperiority he a&s;&s;umes in reconducting him. His audience chair is under a canopy, on which is the Emperor's picture. His annual income is 24,000 guilders, paid out of the Imperial trea&s;ury, and 12,000 out of the Emperor's privy pur&s;e, that is about 4200l. &s;terling.</P>
<P>The envoys of Rati&s;bon, as repre&s;entatives of elec|tors, &amp;c. have very lofty ideas of their office, and a&s;&s;ume &s;uch &s;tate, that when the widow of Duke <HI>Frederick Henry,</HI> of Saxe Zeitz, a prince&s;s of the Hou&s;e of Hol&s;tein Wie&s;enburg, came to pay a vi&s;it to the Cardinal <HI>Saxe Zeitz,</HI> her brother-in-law; her highne&s;s could appear but very &s;eldom in public company, becau&s;e the ladies of the electoral envoys claimed the precedency of her. If &s;overeign German princes at|tend the diet them&s;elves, they &s;it above all the envoys of other princes, except tho&s;e of Au&s;tria, Burgun|dy, and Saltzburg, who have maintained the prece|dency
<PB N="34" REF="37">
by pre&s;cription. It is on account of the&s;e di&s;|putes about precedency, that the Hol&s;tein envoys never attend any of the &s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>All the envoys receive pre&s;ents of wine, fi&s;h, &amp;c. from the city on their fir&s;t arrival, and the Imperial commi&s;&s;ary, a much larger one. In the college the envoys &s;it with their hats on, but uncover them&s;elves when they &s;peak.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that the envoys having every article for their con&s;umption, duty free, is a di&s;advantage to the city. The&s;e envoys are numerous, and they each give a great number of protections. Some will have, in general, forty or fifty per&s;ons in their retinue, none of whom either pay duty, con|tributions, imports, or any of the common city-taxes, though &s;ome at the &s;ame time will keep &s;hops and carry on trade. Under this &s;anction, coachmen and lacqueys &s;et up public-hou&s;es, and draw yearly &s;ome hundreds of hog&s;heads of beer, which, as they pretend, are all of his excellency's hou&s;ehold. It is the &s;ame with regard to wine, which the&s;e pri|vileged publicans import clear of all duty. So that they may ea&s;ily under&s;ell the fair trader. The quan|tity of provi&s;ions brought over the bridge, on the Danube, in &s;even days, with permits for the u&s;e of the envoys, frequently amounts to 1800 or 2000 guilders.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="38">As the Danube directs its cour&s;e from Rati&s;bon to Vienna, it gains this city an advantageous opportunity of &s;ending there, wheat, wood, and &s;everal kinds of provi&s;ions. The di&s;tance between the&s;e two cities is about 200 miles, and yet the common people pay no more for their pa&s;&s;ing down the river, than a creutz or a farthing a mile, &s;o that the whole fare, at this rate, does not exceed four or five &s;hillings. <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> &s;ays two &s;hillings and four-pence. This cheap way of travelling induces great numbers of young artificers and handicraft&s;men to go and try their for|tune at Vienna; but they do not find it &s;o ea&s;y to return home, as they generally &s;pend what they earn by their trades, and are often obliged to enli&s;t for &s;oldiers.</P>

<HEAD>ARCHBISHOPRIC OF SALTZBURG.</HEAD>
<P>On the ea&s;t, this bi&s;hopric is bounded by Au&s;tria and Stiria; by Corinthia and the Tyrol on the &s;outh; and by Bavaria on the we&s;t and on the north. Its ex|tent from ea&s;t to we&s;t is about five and twenty Ger|man miles, and from north to &s;outh, in &s;ome parts, &s;ixteen, and in others, five and twenty.</P>
<P>The country is defended on all &s;ides by mountains and narrow pa&s;&s;es, or rather con&s;i&s;ts entirely of moun|tains and vallies. No manner of grain being &s;own here, it is &s;upplied with all its corn from Bavaria;
<PB N="36" REF="39">
but every part of it produces hay of a peculiar good|ne&s;s, and this proves a fund for breeds of excellent cattle. The hor&s;es in particular are e&s;teemed for their beauty, hardine&s;s and vigour, being able to travel full &s;peed up the highe&s;t mountains, and that &s;upported by no other food than hay and gra&s;s with|out any oats.</P>
<P>In this archbi&s;hopric are &s;ix cities and twenty-five towns. All the pea&s;ants are allowed the u&s;e of fire|arms, and are from their earlie&s;t youth trained up to &s;hooting at a mark, and practi&s;ing military exerci&s;es. The nobility were formerly very numerous, but the policy of the princes &s;et &s;o many &s;prings at work to oppre&s;s and exterminate them, that at pre&s;ent there is not one remaining, and their e&s;tates are in the hands of the church. With re&s;pect to the few no|bles at court, or belonging to the cathedral, they are all foreigners, &s;ome Au&s;trians, &s;ome Bohemians, and others from Bavaria. Though the Roman catholic wor&s;hip is the only one tolerated, yet at the time of the reformation, Lutherani&s;m was embraced by great numbers. So late as the year 1732, permi&s;&s;ion was granted to the Lutheran Saltzburgers to leave the country, and take their property with them; accord|ingly above 30,000 per&s;ons accepted this indulgence, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves in the other prote&s;tant coun|tries of Germany, Pru&s;&s;ia, and even in the Engli&s;h colonies in America. In all which places they were
<PB N="37" REF="40">
received with that benevolence and encouragement which their magnanimity de&s;erved; and ever &s;ince that time, the&s;e emigrations have continued.</P>
<P>His revenues are e&s;timated by <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> at 800,000 rix-dollars; <HI>Bu&s;ching</HI> affirms they are not le&s;s than between three and four millions of guilders. <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> on the contrary &s;ays, they are not above 120,000l. which is le&s;s than <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> makes them; as eight hun|dred thou&s;and rix-dollars, at three &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence each, makes above 200,000l. But according to <HI>Bu&s;ching</HI> reckoning the guilder at two &s;hillings and four-pence, which is the average of the German guilder, the income then would be near 400,000l.</P>
<P>The extent of the country is e&s;timated at two hun|dred and forty German &s;quare miles. There are only &s;even or eight towns, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> &s;ome of which are not to be compared with a Suabian village. The total number of inhabitants is computed at two hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and. There is only one manu|facture in the whole country, which is a &s;mall one at Hallein for cotton &s;tockings and night-caps.</P>
<P>The inhabitants live chiefly by breeding cattle. In many places you may find very rich farmers, who own from &s;ixty to four&s;core head of great cattle. They export &s;ome chee&s;e and butter, but not &s;o much as they might do, if the inhabitants were as indu&s;|trious,
<PB N="38" REF="41">
frugal, and di&s;po&s;ed for trade as the Swi&s;s. Be&s;ides horned cattle, they al&s;o breed great numbers of hor&s;es, which are very &s;trong, and are exported to great di&s;tances for the purpo&s;e of heavy draught and burthen.</P>
<P>The &s;alt-works at Hallein are without compari&s;on the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. The internal parts of the mountain which is about four miles di&s;tant from this place, con&s;i&s;t of cry&s;tals of &s;alt, mixed with a great deal of earth. In order to clean it, they dig large, hollow chambers within &s;ide, and fill them with water, which wa&s;hes the &s;alt, and lets the earth &s;ink to the bottom. The water thus impregnated, is conveyed into pens and boiled off. In cour&s;e of time the cham|bers fill, of them&s;elves, with &s;alt, and the trea&s;ure is inexhau&s;tible. One of the&s;e chambers, when lighted, makes the prettie&s;t &s;ight in the world. Conceive to your&s;elf a hall about a hundred feet &s;quare, the walls and ground of which are compo&s;ed of cry&s;tal of every earthly colour, and which reflect the light &s;o wonderfully, that you would think your&s;elf in &s;ome enchanted palace. In order to carry on this work, the woods of the fore&s;ts along the Saltza and other rivers is floated down them.</P>
<P>From the unfavourable &s;ituation of this country, it cannot u&s;e the whole of this trea&s;ure for it&s;elf, but is obliged to give the mo&s;t part to foreigners. All
<PB N="39" REF="42">
the country round about belongs either to Au&s;tria or to Bavaria. In Au&s;tria they have &s;alt &s;ufficient for their own u&s;e, and have prohibited the importation of foreign &s;alt. Bavaria, on the other hand, has &s;o productive a &s;alt work at Rati&s;bon, that it not only provides &s;ufficient for that country, but al&s;o can af|ford a con&s;iderable quantity to foreigners. The arch|bi&s;hop of Bavaria have con&s;equently found them|&s;elves obliged to enter into an agreement with the Dukes of Bavaria, by virtue of which the&s;e take a certain quantity of &s;alt every year, at a very mode|rate price, with which they furni&s;h Switzerland and Suabia. By this means, the &s;alt trade of Saltzburg is properly in the hands of Bavaria, which gains full three times as much by it as the Princes of Saltzburg. The value of the &s;alt which Bavaria &s;tipulates to take yearly, amounts to about 20,000l. What is di&s;po&s;ed of in the country it&s;elf, or carried clande&s;tinely into Au&s;tria, makes in the whole about 35,000l. of which two thirds may be clear gain.</P>
<P>The gold and &s;ilver mines of this principality make a great figure in the geography of Germany; but compared with the &s;alt-works, are not worth mention|ing. The roads through this mountainous country are not in general very good. Notwith&s;tanding, the pa&s;&s;age is now and then on wooden bridges hung by chains over &s;ome dreadful aby&s;&s;es, the heavie&s;t car|riages have nothing to fear, except, perhaps, the
<PB N="40" REF="43">
being over&s;et by a violent bla&s;t of wind, or being co|vered by a fall of &s;now in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>About &s;ix miles from Saltzburg there is a long nar|row valley bounded by high mountains, which &s;tretches it&s;elf &s;ome miles &s;outhward and then we&s;t|ward. At the entrance of this valley is the pa&s;s of Lueg or Luhk, a word, which in Engli&s;h means look, or watch-tower. This pa&s;s is a deep narrow hollow between naked, and perpendicular rocks of granate, which hang over the road, on each &s;ide, to an amazing height, and between which the river Saltza runs like a torrent. Above the river a path has been cut along the &s;ide of a rock, and there is a gate with &s;carce room for a carriage to pa&s;s, which is protected by a battery, &s;o that a few people here could with&s;tand a whole army. The other approaches to this valley, which con&s;titute the greate&s;t part of the principality of Saltzburg, are equally well guard|ed and defended.</P>
<P>The country about Saltzburg forms a &s;triking con|tra&s;t with the barren, de&s;olate wilds of Munich. For &s;eventeen long miles, the di&s;tance between the&s;e two cities, there is no place of note, but the dark Wa&s;|&s;erburg, which &s;tands on one of the barren &s;and-hills, round which the river Inn winds. Near the frontiers of Saltzburg, the pro&s;pects become varied, the habi|tations
<PB N="41" REF="44">
of the pea&s;ants appear nearer, and the cultiva|tion of the country improves.</P>
<P>Saltzburg is a fine city. The hou&s;es are high and built with &s;tone. The roofs are in the Italian ta&s;te, and you may walk out upon them. Before the pa|lace is a fountain, which pa&s;&s;es for the fine&s;t in all Germany; the figures are all of white marble. The re&s;ervoir is an hundred and &s;even feet in circumfe|rence, four large hor&s;es &s;pout the water out of their mouths and no&s;trils; the height of the whole work exceeds fifty feet, and is &s;urmounted by a column of water, &s;ome inches in diameter, and eighteen feet high.</P>
<P>The palace is magnificent, abounding with fine pictures, tables of inlaid marble, and &s;uperb &s;tones of all colours, and ornamented with &s;tatues: the fur|niture has nothing remarkable; and though the ta|pe&s;tries are valuable on account of the gold and &s;il|ver, yet age has deprived them of the greate&s;t part of their beauty. The meu&s;e is in three very long and high arched divi&s;ions; the hor&s;es, who&s;e num|ber amounts to a hundred and fifty, eat out of white marble mangers; and twice a week a running water is turned in through both &s;ides of the &s;talls, and carries away any filth which may have gathered there; the number of the Archbi&s;hop's hor&s;es in the city, and at his country palaces, are &s;aid to be two hun|dred
<PB N="42" REF="45">
and fifty. Over this &s;table is the fencing &s;chool, and before it a pond for watering the hor&s;es, ninety-three feet in length; within it &s;tands a very large hor&s;e, made of one piece of marble, with water gu&s;hing out of his mouth.</P>
<P>The winter riding-&s;chool is very lofty, placed with &s;eats on both &s;ides of the walls, between the windows, for the accommodation of &s;pectators of di&s;tinction, that the riders may not be incommoded in their exerci&s;es. The &s;ummer riding-&s;chool, which al&s;o &s;erves for baiting wild bea&s;ts, is in the open air; it has three di&s;tinct galleries, one &s;ide of which are cut out of the rock.</P>
<P>In the cathedral all the altars are of beautiful mar|ble of different kinds; under the cupola are four altars with an organ over each; the fifth and fine&s;t organ is over the chief entrance, and con&s;i&s;ts of three thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty pipes, of which the longe&s;t is thirty-three feet; to this organ belong four keys and forty-two regi&s;ters, of which &s;eventeen are of clock-work. The roof of this church is covered with copper; the gallery between the cathedral and the palace, is of white marble; and nothing of the kind can make finer mu&s;ic, than the chimes of this cathedral.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="46">In St. Seba&s;tian's church lies the famous Switzer, <HI>Theophra&s;tus Bompa&s;t,</HI> &s;urnamed <HI>Paracel&s;us,</HI> of the greate&s;t puffers that ever lived, with the following o&s;tentatious epitaph:</P>
<P><HI>Conditur hic Philippus Theophra&s;tus, in&s;ignis medicinae doctor, qui dira illa vulnera, lepram, podagram, hydro|pi&s;in aliaque in&s;anabilia corporis contagia mirifica arte &s;u&s;|tulit, ac bona &s;ua in pauperes di&s;tribuenda, collocandaque honoravit.

<P>"Here lies interred, <HI>Philip Theophra&s;tus,</HI> a cele|brated doctor of phy&s;ic, who, with wonderful &s;kill, removed tho&s;e dreadful plagues, the lepro&s;y, gout, and drop&s;y, with every other incurable malady; his wealth he liberally di&s;tributed, and afterwards be|queathed to the poor. On the 24th September, 1741, he departed this life."</P>
<P>A little above the city, &s;prings the Ga&s;tein bath, who&s;e waters are very hot, and have a very &s;trong ta&s;te of different minerals. They are &s;aid to be a remedy for the &s;tone, the venereal di&s;order, and for the cholic, and this too only by bathing in them, without drinking them.</P>
<P>The city of Saltzburg is remarked for having the be&s;t accommodations for travellers of any city in Germany.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="47">The inhabitants in general appear very &s;ocial, open, and lively, and uncommonly attached to &s;trangers. Every thing in this city breathes the air of plea&s;ure and joy. They eat, drink, laugh, dance, &s;ing, and gamble in the extreme, nor is there any place when you can enjoy &s;o many plea&s;ures for a little money. The people conver&s;e upon religion and politics, with a freedom that does honour to the place, and with re&s;pect to books, all German publications may be had without the lea&s;t re&s;traint.</P>
<P>The upper nobility of the place is made up chiefly of Au&s;trian families, who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by their affability, their knowledge of the world, and their manners. On the other hand, the &s;warm of little court gentry render them&s;elves ridiculous by their pitiful lu&s;ts after titles and their pride. You mu&s;t vi&s;it about a hundred of there <HI>Gnadige herren,</HI> which title, in German, means Gracious Sir, who live upon three or four hundred florins a year, which they receive from court, but whom you can|not offend more than by calling them plain Sir, and their wives plain Madam. A man who lives here mu&s;t accu&s;tom him&s;elf to put in <HI>Gnadige herren</HI> at every third word, unle&s;s he choo&s;es to pa&s;s for being ill-bred. Mo&s;t of them have neither e&s;tates nor mo|ney; the court is therefore compelled to make their appointments as &s;lender as po&s;&s;ible, to keep them from &s;tarving; though above two-thirds of them are
<PB N="45" REF="48">
&s;uperfluous &s;ervants. Many of them amu&s;e them&s;elves with French and German literature, particularly with all that relates to the &s;tage. The rage for the theatre here is very great, and they look for the coming of a company of &s;trolling players, with as much eager|ne&s;s as the inhabitants of Siberia look for the return of the &s;pring. Give this cla&s;s of people their right titles, and you will find them the be&s;t kind of crea|tures living.</P>
<P>The country people are uncommonly lively and gay. The young women of the&s;e &s;eque&s;tered vales, fre&s;h as ro&s;es, and lively as a roe, under&s;tand the art of coquetry as well as any Pari&s;ian lady, except that the allurements they di&s;play are more natural; they know how to employ the ornamental part of dre&s;s to the be&s;t advantage If they are di&s;po&s;ed to make their lover happy, neither the &s;hame of an illegiti|mate birth, nor the fear of being obliged to main|tain it, is of any con&s;ideration. Cu&s;tom &s;ets them above the fir&s;t, and the ea&s;e of maintaining a child above the latter. Murder of infants here is extreme|ly uncommon, they all yield, without re&s;traint or re|&s;erve, to the impul&s;e of nature. The young girls ki&s;s and &s;hake hands in the open church on Sundays, with tho&s;e they love. On a nightly vi&s;it, however, the lover is rather in a hard &s;ituation, for let the wea|ther be ever &s;o unfriendly, he is not admitted, until a certain watch-word is given, which, in gene|ral,
<PB N="46" REF="49">
con&s;i&s;ts of long rhimes, that in a my&s;terious manner expre&s;s his &s;ufferings and his &s;mart. This cu&s;tom is very old, and in many of the remote parts of the mountains, &s;acred and inviolable.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the&s;e mountains are &s;o con|tented, that they con&s;ider their country as a kind of paradi&s;e. Tho&s;e who lived in Dintner valley, a fright|ful gap, between naked rocks, through which the river Dintner runs, have a &s;aying, "That when any one falls from heaven, he mu&s;t fall into Dintner val|ley." Which is as much to &s;ay, that this valley is a &s;econd heaven.</P>
<P>Many of the pea&s;ants &s;till wear long beards, and go with their heads uncovered, and their brea&s;ts open, at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year. As they are extremely hairy, and very much &s;un-burnt, this gives them a very formidable look, but when you come near them, their friendly air and appearance of integrity &s;peak very &s;trongly in their favour. They are courageous and &s;trong, and would, no doubt, make a brave de|fence in their own country; but out of it they are &s;aid not to make good &s;oldiers. Like all the inha|bitants of mountains, they cannot &s;tand a change of climate. Be&s;ides the peculiarity of their diet, and which they mu&s;t renounce in the field, their not being able to bear fatigue, makes them unfit for &s;er|vice. Man re&s;embles his &s;oil, unle&s;s education and
<PB N="47" REF="50">
&s;ociety change him. The pea&s;ant of this country bears the &s;tamp of nature upon him. His movements are quick, like the &s;tream in the wood; he is boi&s;te|rous in his pa&s;&s;ions, like the atmo&s;phere; he breathes &s;trong as the oak which &s;hades him; and is faithful, firm, and true, as the rock which bears his hut. The life and variety of the &s;cenes which nature offers him here, render his head richer in conceptions, and his heart warmer than it would be, if he dwelt upon an uniform plain, and gave him&s;elf up to nature as he does here. His di&s;tance from populous cities, and the &s;cattered &s;ituation of the huts, pre&s;erve his man|ners pure, and make him more attentive to his own concerns.</P>
<P>Mountainous &s;ituations have, unque&s;tionably, in many re&s;pects, a preference over the plains. The pul&s;e of nature beats &s;tronger; every thing di&s;covers more life and energy; every thing more loudly and emphatically &s;peaks an Almighty power at work. The &s;tream which meanders through the plain, makes through the mountains, and grows impetuous in its cour&s;e; the motion of the clouds, the revolutions of the &s;ky, and the peals of thunder, are all more &s;trongly animated. The vallies in the fair &s;ea&s;on of the year, are filled with finer perfumes of flowers and herbs, than tho&s;e of the plains, who&s;e &s;oil is not &s;o fit to pre&s;erve their radical moi&s;ture, and where their exhalations are di&s;&s;ipated more widely in the air.
<PB N="48" REF="51">
Nature here is more varied, and infinitely more pic|ture&s;que. Of her different &s;hades, an inhabitant of the plain can form no conception. Here at once nature pre&s;ents the peculiarities of every &s;ea&s;on, and the mo&s;t di&s;tant climes. Whil&s;t the &s;ummer la&s;ts, in the bottom of the valley is felt the heat of Africa; the middle of the mountain has the temperature of &s;pring, and the top reminds you of Siberia.</P>
<P>This country is &s;ingularly intere&s;ting to a botani&s;t, or mineralogi&s;t; but having the misfortune to be very little known, the di&s;covery of its trea&s;ures is re&s;erved for futurity, till either &s;ome man of genius &s;hall ad|dict him&s;elf to the&s;e pur&s;uits, or the &s;warm of idle travellers, who hover, like cock-chafers, about the Apennines, Alps, Aetna, and the Pyreneans, &s;hall take their flight to the&s;e parts, and excite &s;ome fo|reign genius to the ta&s;k. The Zillerthal is particu|larly rich in different &s;orts of variegated &s;tones, and in many parts of the hills you meet with very &s;carce European plants. In fine, there is room for weaving many an hypothe&s;is on the plants of the hills, on the work and production of the waters in them, and on the revolutions of nature that may &s;till be expected in them.</P>
<P>It was with great plea&s;ure, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> I wandered over this romantic country, and &s;ometimes &s;tanding on &s;ome immen&s;e peak, I viewed under me the clouds,
<PB N="49" REF="52">
towered on clouds, boundle&s;s plains, innumerable lakes, rivers and brooks, vallies of tremendous depth, and the bare &s;ummits of huge granate rocks, with &s;en&s;ations peculiar to their heavenly regions. Some|times, &s;ays he, I took my abode in the deep hang|ing brow of a mountain, in a &s;hepherde&s;s's hut, who dwelt the whole &s;ummer through, with her flock in this &s;ubtere&s;trial region, and is vi&s;ited only by her lover, who clambers up two or three miles of the mountains to her, or by &s;ome wild-goat hunter, or &s;trayed knight, like my&s;elf; there I live a day, like an ancient patriarch, on milk and chee&s;e, count the flock which in the evening a&s;&s;embles round the hut, at the &s;ound of a flute, and which, for the moment I can think my own; &s;leep upon a heap of hay far more tranquil than upon the mo&s;t luxurious down|bed, and enjoy the beauties of the ri&s;ing &s;un, with a luxury and delight, which at operas, comedies, balls, and &s;uch like entertainments are looked for in vain.</P>
<P>The Saltzburg pea&s;ant clothes him&s;elf from head to foot; every family weaves a &s;ort of coar&s;e, dark, grey cloth, from wool which they grow and prepare them|&s;elves. They al&s;o make their own &s;hoes and &s;tock|ings. Their dre&s;s is by the&s;e means clean, &s;imple, and graceful. The face of the pea&s;ants of this coun|try is better than that in mo&s;t others. The Saltz|burger cannot content him&s;elf with chee&s;e and pota|toes like the Swi&s;s, but mu&s;t always have his meat,
<PB N="50" REF="53">
which, however, fat it may be, he con&s;tantly dips in hogs lard. He mu&s;t likewi&s;e have bread, beer, and brandy, good of the kind, and in plenty. If this ex|travagance was not counterbalanced by their admira|ble economy in other re&s;pects, they would be the poore&s;t people in Europe.</P>
<P>The military force of this archbi&s;hopric con&s;i&s;ts only of one regiment of foot, containing 1000 men. Every bailiwick has its rendezvous, to which, on &s;ig|nals given, by means of cannon planted on the moun|tains, they repair completely armed. The number of pea&s;ants who can hit a mark of an hand's-breadth, are computed at 25,000.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity is kept up by the congregation of Benedictines, who &s;upply it with profe&s;&s;ors. As the having &s;tudied here is a kind of requi&s;ite for eccle&s;i|a&s;tical preferment in the circle of Suabia, it is a place of &s;ome re&s;ort for &s;tudents from that quarter; but tho&s;e excepted, and a few of the natives, there are no others, though the chairs of the profe&s;&s;ors are filled with very able men. The funds of the uni|ver&s;ity are too &s;mall, they do not in the whole exceed 500l. per annum.</P>
<P>The civil and military officers of Saltzburg have a very great advantage over tho&s;e of other countries, which is, that half their &s;alaries are continued to
<PB N="51" REF="54">
their widows during their life, or till they change their condition.</P>
<P>From the top of the <HI>Unterberge,</HI> a mountain near Saltzburg, there is a pro&s;pect over all Bavaria. Nine lakes may be reckoned up in one view. The mo&s;t charming part of this pro&s;pect, however, is the prin|cipality of Berchtol&s;gaden, which lies to the &s;outh of the mountain. It con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;mall narrow vale, encompa&s;&s;ed around with va&s;t heights of the mo&s;t picture&s;que granate, and hardly contains 3000 inha|bitants. The nature of this country being favourable neither to agriculture nor pa&s;ture, the inhabitants have given them&s;elves to works of art, which fail mankind in no part of the earth, and are mighty and powerful enough to turn the harde&s;t &s;tones into bread. It is in the&s;e remote vallies that they make the greate&s;t part of the toys with which Nuremberg and Aug&s;|burg carry on &s;o con&s;iderable a trade. The hor&s;es with &s;purs, little ra&s;ps, cukows, wooden mannakins, rats and mice, and all the play-things for little chil|dren; al&s;o the crucifixes, &s;traw quadrille boxes, pow|der and pomatum boxes, and all the play-things for great children, in a word, the greater part of the articles which go among&s;t us, under the name of Ger|man toys. It is a pretty &s;ight to behold two or three families in a hut, and to &s;ee the great plump hands of the farmers occupied in giving a fini&s;h to the &s;malle&s;t articles. Here is occupation for the old as
<PB N="52" REF="55">
well as the young. The &s;mall price the&s;e commodi|ties &s;ell for, makes it impo&s;&s;ible for them to accumu|late riches; but they have enough, and are happy. The&s;e good people little think their productions are di&s;per&s;ed all over Europe, and that the Spaniards drive a very profitable trade with them in both Indies.</P>
<P>Hellbrunn is a palace of the Archbi&s;hop, near the city, the building of which has nothing in it remark|able, but the gardens are very plea&s;ant; they are laid out in the manner of a wilderne&s;s, and abound with the fine&s;t water-works, re&s;ervoirs, ponds and ba|&s;ons, &s;o clear that trouts and other fi&s;h may be &s;een &s;porting in them, and nibbling the calves and ox li|vers with which they are fed. By the&s;e waters all kinds of little figures of mills, &s;ci&s;&s;ar-grinders, &amp;c. are thrown about the garden; and in the grotto you are &s;ure of being &s;prinkled by the artificial play|ing of the water. Over one of the many &s;prings in this garden, is the &s;tatue of a mon&s;ter, which might be taken for a &s;avage or wild-man, were it not for its cock's-comb and eagle's feet. Under it is this in|&s;cription. Anno 1531.</P>
<P>"The original of this mon&s;trous figure, called a <HI>fore&s;t devil,</HI> was caught a hunting near Stavenburg; his &s;kin was yellowi&s;h, he had all the marks of &s;a|vagene&s;s, and never looked at any one, but hid him|&s;elf
<PB N="53" REF="56">
in corners; he had the face of a man with a beard, eagle's feet with lion's claws, the tail of a dog, and on his head grew a large cock's-comb; he &s;oon died with hunger, as no alurements nor violence could make him eat or drink."</P>

<HEAD>THE BISHOPRIC OF PASSAU.</HEAD>
<P>This city is &s;ituated &s;ixty miles South-Ea&s;t of Ra|ti&s;bon, at the confluence of the three rivers, Danube, Inn, and Ilt&s;z. It is divided into four parts, the town of Pa&s;&s;au, Inn&s;tadt, Ilt&s;z&s;tadt, and the quarter in which the Bi&s;hop's palace is &s;eated. The fir&s;t three are fortified, but the la&s;t, which is only a &s;ub|urb, has nothing but an old ca&s;tle, in which the Bi|&s;hop generally re&s;ides. It was in this city that peace was concluded between Charles V. and the prote&s;tant princes in 1552, by which the Lutherans were to enjoy the free exerci&s;e of their religion. Pa&s;&s;au is but a very mi&s;erable, ill-built town, tho&s;e parts ex|cepted which lie near the Danube, and the prince's palace. It is well &s;ituated for trade, but its chief &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence comes from the court, the income of which is about &pound;.22,000 a year, and on the canons, who&s;e benefices are the riche&s;t in Germany. A &s;tall here being &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth about 3000 florins a year, and what with the income of other benefices, there are few of them who have not nearly double that in|come.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="57">The inhabitants of the&s;e &s;everal holy cities are all much alike, as drinking and intriguing con&s;titute their principal occupation; and the poverty and good humour which &s;eldom for&s;ake tho&s;e who are thus addicted, render them affable, ob&s;equious and hum|ble. The cathedral is a fine Gothic building which merits well to be viewed. There are fine china ma|nufactories and potteries in this country; the pro|duce of the former is carried as far as the Rhine.</P>
<P>Many attempts have been made to plant vines on the I&s;er and Danube below Rati&s;bon, but hitherto they have produced grapes only for eating; this whole tract of country being too full of wood and water for the vine to ripen in. But what was Suabia in the times of <HI>Tacitus?</HI> Little did the Romans think the vine would grow in Germany when they doubted whether even fruit would grow there. And yet Suabia produces &s;ome noble vines now, which may rival the Falernian and Roman wines for their excellence.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on to be a&s;&s;igned is, that the air of a coun|try changes with its cultivation. The drying up of mar&s;hes renders it warmer. The evaporation too occa&s;ioned by numbers who live together may work upon the air. The &s;lopes of the hills on the left &s;ide of the Danube, between this place and Rati&s;bon, promi&s;e a good place to plant vines in, as they are
<PB N="55" REF="58">
well guarded from the noxious winds; and the wine made near Pa&s;&s;au truly merits the name of wine.</P>
<P>This large vale of the Danube produces likewi&s;e the be&s;t kind of corn and would very ea&s;ily nouri&s;h twice the number of inhabitants it does at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Corn is often &s;o cheap in Bavaria as hardly to pay the farmer for the trouble of rai&s;ing it: one hundred and &s;eventy pounds of rye are frequently &s;old for about two &s;lorins.</P>
<P>Navigation is by no means &s;o well under&s;tood in this country as it is upon the Upper Rhine; they do not yet under&s;tand how to &s;ail by the direc|tion of the river. Mo&s;t of the ve&s;&s;els which come down the Danube from Rati&s;bon and Ulm are with|out decks or ma&s;ts; they are built only of fir-boards, and are &s;old again either at Vienna or el&s;ewhere. The Emperor has promi&s;ed great encouragement to tho&s;e per&s;ons who will build their ve&s;&s;els like tho&s;e on the Rhine; but in this, as in every thing el&s;e, it is difficult to make the mechanical part of the public tread the track, to which they have not been accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>Though Bavaria is a rich, plentiful country and lies well &s;ituated for trade, from the Danube and &s;everal other navigable rivers pa&s;&s;ing through it, yet the inhabitants in general are not rich, which is &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="56" REF="59">
to proceed from the Elector's monopolizing the mo&s;t con&s;iderable articles of commerce, particularly that of &s;alt, which he prohibits his &s;ubjects either from importing or from purcha&s;ing of any per&s;on except him&s;elf. A &s;econd monopoly is that of corn, the farmer is obliged to &s;ell all his corn to the Elector's agents who retail it out again to the people. This prince, like the Czar of Mu&s;covy, is Premier-General for his dominions; none may brew or &s;ell &s;trong beer but the Elector's factors. There is only an indifferent &s;mall beer which the pea&s;ants and citizens are allowed to brew in their own hou&s;es. The Bi&s;hop of Pa&s;&s;au, who&s;e territories lie within this circle, likewi&s;e imi|tates the Elector in this tyranny. The chief &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence of the pea&s;ants of this circle is their herds of &s;wine, which are fed in their woods; and the wild bea&s;ts and game which they meet with there, though it is penal to meddle with the game: but in mo&s;t parts of Bavaria, corn, beer, and &s;alt are &s;o exce&s;&s;ive dear that a pea&s;ant can &s;carce afford to purcha&s;e them. After what has been remarked re&s;pecting the&s;e mono|polies, it is needle&s;s to ob&s;erve that the Elector is ab|&s;olute in his dominions. There are &s;ome general laws in the empire that all princes and &s;tates are governed by, but they are often di&s;obeyed where there is not a force to compel the ob&s;ervance of them. The Elector and the Archbi&s;hop of Saltzburg are joint di|rectors of the circle. The Elector of Bavaria &s;tiles him&s;elf Duke of the Upper and Lower Bavaria, and
<PB N="75" REF="60">
of the Upper Palatinate, Duke and Count Palatine of the Rhine; Elector and Vicar of the Empire, and Grand Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>In the lower part of Bavaria there are many more nobility who re&s;ide con&s;tantly on their e&s;tates than in any parts of Germany: and to this may be attributed the advantage of their &s;uperior cultivation; for as the nobles are farmers, it is no wonder that e&s;tates are managed better under the ma&s;ter's eye than in his ab|&s;ence. Though there are not many of them who are great proficients in agriculture, yet a life pa&s;&s;ed in the mid&s;t of it, mu&s;t yield a greater in&s;ight into the means of its improvement than one &s;pent in the pa|rade of a court. Be&s;ides, the nobles them&s;elves will naturally treat their pea&s;ants better than the race of bailiffs, agents, &amp;c. who oppre&s;s and &s;queeze them for their own emolument, and it is an indi&s;putable fact that tho&s;e landlords are riche&s;t, and their e&s;tates be&s;t cultivated, where the pea&s;ants are allowed &s;ome degree of liberty and property.</P>
<P>Though the pea&s;ants in this country are in a &s;tate of villenage, they are treated in a kinder man|ner, and have more property and better hou&s;es than in other parts of Germany; and many of them are al&s;o farmers, who, by indu&s;try and frugality, have &s;aved many. Much of this country is enclo&s;ed, than which there cannot be any improvement of &s;o great

con&s;equence. Sheep &s;eems to be a principal article in their hu&s;bandry. Every farm of any &s;ize has a large &s;heep-hou&s;e, with a roof, but open on one &s;ide to the &s;outh; in this hou&s;e they fold their &s;heep every night the year round, and depend on it princi|pally for manuring their lands: when they begin to fold, they &s;pread over the floor light, virgin &s;oil, turf, &s;and, or peat-earth, and fold upon it, till it is very moi&s;t and dirty, then they make a fre&s;h layer and &s;o go on; but to every eighteen inches of depth they litter with &s;traw, for they remove the heap but once a year, and in extreme wet or &s;nowy weather they do the &s;ame. This is an excellent &s;y&s;tem for rai&s;ing manure, but it might be imagined that the &s;heep lying on a dunghill would be prejudicial to their health, this the Bavarians deny, and on the contrary a&s;&s;ert that not only the health of the animal is the better for it, but likewi&s;e that the wool is much finer than if the &s;heep were expo&s;ed to the weather.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. <HI>Of the Circle of Swabia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SWABIA is bounded by Franconia on the north, Bavaria on the ea&s;t, Switzerland on the &s;outh, and Al&s;ace on the we&s;t. It contains the duchies of Wurtemberg, the Margravate of Baden, the princi|pality of Hohen-Zollern, that of Oetringen, and that of Mindelheim; the bi&s;hopricks of Aug&s;burg, Con|&s;tance and Coire, with &s;everal baronies, abbies, and free towns. It derives its name from the Sueir who were &s;o called from their long hair, which <HI>Tacitus</HI> mentions as a peculiarity belonging to them, by which a Swabian was known.</P>
<P>This country prides it&s;elf, not a little, in the &s;ource of that famous river the Danube: its cour&s;e is not le&s;s than four hundred German miles; it flows by fifty large cities, and takes in twelve great rivers, be|&s;ides above eighty le&s;&s;er &s;treams, &s;o that few rivers can be brought into competition with it, not even the Nile it&s;elf. This celebrated river ri&s;es near <HI>Don-E&s;chingen,</HI> in the territories of <HI>Fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;temberg,</HI> and by the conflux of &s;everal rivers &s;oon becomes con&s;iderable. <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> notices a &s;ingular circum&s;tance which he ob|&s;erved

at a chapel built on an eminence near Burla|tingen, a hunting &s;eat of the prince of Hohen-Zol|lern; its being &s;ituated &s;o that the rain which fell on one &s;ide of the chapel went into the Danube, and that which fell on the other, into the Rhine. On the chapel is a very &s;uitable in&s;cription taken from the p&s;alms.</P>
<Q>Sit nomen domini laudabile ab oriente ad occidentem.</Q>

<P>The Rhine, the principal &s;ource of which took its ri&s;e on one &s;ide of the chapel, emptying it&s;elf in the German Ocean; and the Danube, running in a quite contrary direction, and lo&s;ing it&s;elf in the Black Sea.</P>
<P>In fertility of &s;oil the territories of the circle of Swabia vary very much, which is a con&s;tant &s;ource of complaint to the a&s;&s;emblies of the circle, from di&s;|tricts, which imagine them&s;elves aggrieved in their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments. The highe&s;t parts in Swabia are the Alps and the Schwarzwald or Black Fore&s;t; the for|mer of which are &s;till &s;omewhat higher than the lat|ter. The Schwarzwald has probably been &s;o called from the thick fore&s;ts of fir with which it is covered; and, according to the de&s;cription given us by <HI>Julius
<PB N="61" REF="65">
Cae&s;ar</HI> of the <HI>Sylva Hyrcinia,</HI> this was the beginning of it. This wood is by much the large&s;t in Germany, being &s;ixty days journey in length and nine in breadth. The inhabitants &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by graziery, wood, and pitch, which they trade in for exportation. In many parts of it, there are two kinds of land, one like the common ploughed fields, and the other rendered fertile by the following method. The pea&s;ants lay billets of fir about &s;ix feet long at a proper di&s;tance, and between them vine branches covered with &s;ods pared off the &s;ame field. One of the&s;e heaps is cal|led a <HI>ro&s;s</HI> or <HI>hor&s;e;</HI> and the number of them is pro|portioned to the dimen&s;ions of the field. The&s;e they kindle, leaving them to con&s;ume &s;lowly, and the a&s;hes and earth are then &s;cattered over the ground, to which they communicate an extraordinary ferti|lity; but this la&s;ts only for three or four years. It is then left for &s;ome years fallow, and yields good gra&s;s, till it becomes again fit to undergo the above ope|ration.</P>
<P>This circle contains 720 &s;quare German miles. Under the emperor <HI>Frederic</HI> III. the circle of Swabia was divided into four quarters, which divi&s;ion &s;till continues and on many occa&s;ions has been found to be very beneficial. The duke of Wurtemberg is head of the fir&s;t, the Margrave of Baden the &s;econd, the Bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance and the Abbot of Kempten heads of the third, and the Bi&s;hop of Augu&s;burg head of the fourth.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE TERRITORIES OF THE DUKE OF WURTEMBURG.</HEAD>
<P>The greate&s;t part of this dukedom con&s;i&s;ts in an exten&s;ive valley, which is bounded on the ea&s;t by a chain of hills, called the Alps; on the we&s;t by the Black Fore&s;t, on the north by a part of the mountain of Oden Wald, and an arm of the Black Fore&s;t. On the whole it inclines to the northward, and is watered in the middle by the river Neckar. Several &s;maller arms run off from the &s;urrounding chain of hills to|wards the centre, cro&s;s each other in various direc|tions, and form little vallies, which are watered by an infinity of rivers. The land is rendered exceedingly fruitful by the&s;e le&s;&s;er hills, which &s;helter the vallies from the cold hills, and collect the heat of the &s;un between them.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern &s;ides of the&s;e mountains and hills are planted with vines very high up, and above them there is excellent dyers and bru&s;h-wood; and at the bottom is a grey coloured, light mould, which yields all kind of corn, but particularly barley, in a&s;toni&s;h|ing plenty. Upon the whole, this country re&s;embles the middle part of Lorrain; but the &s;oil is much better, and there are not &s;o many &s;tones in it. Ex|cepting &s;alt, which it is obliged to have recour&s;e to Bavaria for, it abounds in all the nece&s;&s;aries of life.
<PB N="63" REF="67">
What corn is not con&s;umed in the country is &s;ent to Switzerland, and the wine goes as far as England. The whole extent of the country does not contain more than two hundred, German &s;quare miles. In this circuit there are about five hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and inhabitants, that is, about two thou&s;and eight hundred to every German &s;quare mile. Tho&s;e parts of Germany excepted, which are in the neigh|bourhood of &s;ome capital cities, and &s;ome di&s;tricts of Italy and the Netherlands, there is certainly no country in Europe &s;o populous in proportion to its extent as this. It is however &s;o fruitful as to be able to &s;upport as many more inhabitants.</P>
<P>The income of the Duke amounts to about three hundred thou&s;and pounds a year. Some calculations make the &s;um &s;maller; but as there are few parts of Germany in which the taxes are not e&s;timated at five florins per head, and in &s;ome they pay much more, why &s;hould it not be &s;o in Wurtemberg, which is one of the large&s;t territories in Germany, and in which the &s;ubject is not more &s;pared?</P>
<P>After the electors, the Duke is beyond compari&s;on the greate&s;t Prince in Germany, though the land|grave of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, who has not above two thirds of the &s;ubjects or yearly income, is of more con&s;e|quence in the Empire, on account of his connection with England.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="68">The government of this dukedom is not &s;o &s;imple and unmixed as that of the territory of Baden. Here are &s;warms of coun&s;ellors, &s;ecretaries, proctors, and advocates, of which more than half might be &s;pared; but the nature of the government allows them to enjoy their appointments in idlene&s;s. Many of them, it is true, belong to the &s;tate, who&s;e duty it is to limit the authority of the Prince; but not|with&s;tanding the many reductions in the hou&s;ehold it&s;elf, it is &s;till much too large for the Duke's cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In all the cities, towns, and large villages in this duchy, there are certain officers, called private over|&s;eers, who in&s;pect into the offences and mi&s;demea|nours of their fellow-citizens, and make a report of them to the magi&s;tracy of the place, in order that they may be further enquired into, if the magi&s;trates &s;hall think fit. The&s;e inqui&s;itors are private, and &s;wear to the faithful execution of their office; in&s;tead of a &s;alary, they are generally rewarded with a coun&s;ellor's place, or &s;ome other office in the govern|ment. No one knows his accu&s;er, as <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> ob&s;erves, from whom this peculiar circum&s;tance in the police of Wurtemberg is taken, which may be an inlet to many abu&s;es, if their information alone pa&s;&s;es for &s;ufficient proofs, and they are con&s;idered in any other light than as premonitions for the judge, or as incentives to greater cautions for the future. This cu&s;tom is &s;imilar
<PB N="65" REF="69">

<P>Though the country throughout is prote&s;tant, and the Duke alone a catholic, there &s;till prevails a great deal of &s;uper&s;tition and bigotry. The clergy are members of the &s;tate, the&s;e have a juri&s;diction of their own, and are very wealthy.</P>
<P>After the repeal of the edict of Nantz, the Duke of Wurtemberg might have reaped very con&s;ider|able advantages by affording &s;helter and encourage|ment to the French refugees, there being among them many rich people, and tho&s;e profitable manu|factures would have been introduced here which en|riched Brandenburgh, and other countries; but a blind zeal for orthodoxy and the clamours of the clergy, that it would be &s;etting up altar again&s;t altar, and that even Mahometani&s;m was preferable to Calvi|ni&s;m, filled the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates with &s;uch jea|lou&s;ies and apprehen&s;ions, that the court was di&s;ap|pointed in its good intentions. An after-reflection opened peoples eyes, when it was &s;een what a valua|ble opportunity they had rejected.</P>
<P>The Duke's army con&s;i&s;ted formerly of fourteen thou&s;and men, and if his debts were paid, and his other expences moderated, &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment might always be &s;upported; as the population and re|venues
<PB N="66" REF="70">
of the country appear to allow it. At the time of the change, however, they were reduced to about five thou&s;and men, and tho&s;e &s;eem to be none of the be&s;t troops. The late Duke of Wurtemberg, &s;ome few years &s;ince, made him&s;elf the topic of con|ver&s;ation all over Europe for his &s;umptuous fea&s;ts, his magnificent balls, the &s;plendor of his illuminations, in which immen&s;e fore&s;ts were lighted up, his &s;uperb hunting parties, and his brilliant operas, where all the fir&s;t-rate dancers from Paris were procured, with <HI>Noverre</HI> at their head, when his fame was at the high|e&s;t; together with all the principal Italian &s;ingers, at a mo&s;t enormous expence. The con&s;equences were &s;uch as might naturally have been fore&s;een; debt, oppre&s;&s;ive taxes, re&s;i&s;tance on the part of the &s;tates of the country, and finally a commi&s;&s;ion of enquiry i&s;&s;ued from the Imperial court. The debts, upon ex|amination, were found to amount to twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds. The evil coun&s;ellors, as it may ea&s;ily be imagined, were removed; but this would have done but little, had not an alteration about this time taken place in mo&s;t of the le&s;&s;er courts of the Empire, the princes of which, from being oppre&s;&s;ive and ex|travagant tyrants, &s;uddenly contracted a ta&s;te for po|litical economy, and philo&s;ophical pur&s;uits. The Duke of Wurtemberg is now quite a philo&s;opher, he founds &s;chools, farms, cultivates arts and &s;ciences, and e&s;tab|li&s;hes manufactures; in &s;hort, he has endeavoured, in every way po&s;&s;ible to make up for what has been wrong.
<PB N="67" REF="71">
This change has taken place ever &s;ince the year 1778; the Prince took the opportunity of his birth-day to publi&s;h a manife&s;to, of which the following is the &s;ub&s;tance: "That being a man, and from the con|dition of human nature, far removed from the &s;tand|ard of perfection, it could not but fall out, that part|ly from human frailty, ever prone to err, and partly from the want of &s;agacity, and from other cau&s;es many events had taken place which had they not hap|pened, things would have been very different from what they now are, or are likely to be hereafter. This I acknowledge freely, and I a&s;&s;ure my loving &s;ubjects, that every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive year of my life, which it &s;hall plea&s;e the divine Providence to be&s;tow, &s;hall be de|dicated to the promotion of their happine&s;s. Hence|forwards the pro&s;perity of Wurtemberg &s;hall be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on the joint and firm ba&s;is of the &s;overeign's love for his people, and of the people's confidence in the affection of their &s;overeign. And we tru&s;t, that every man will, for the future, live in confidence, that he has a provident and anxious father in his prince, and that the only conte&s;t that &s;hall ari&s;e here|after, &s;hall be which &s;hall do mo&s;t to make his native country happy and flouri&s;hing."</P>
<P>The affection of the people towards their prince was very remarkable. Even when the Duke &s;eemed to have no other care than how he &s;hould load them with new taxes, he did not forfeit their attachment.
<PB N="68" REF="72">
The cur&s;es of the people fell on his &s;ervants, and the crew of projectors who led him a&s;tray. But as &s;oon as they were bani&s;hed, he became the idol of his &s;ub|jects; and very de&s;ervedly &s;o.</P>
<P>All the princes of the Hou&s;e of Wurtemberg Stut|gard are brave, and as it were born for military at|chievements. Prince <HI>Maximilian</HI> e&s;pecially gave the greate&s;t hopes of him&s;elf, when &s;carce fourteen years of age, he entered into the &s;ervice of <HI>Charles</HI> XII. of Sweden, and continued to attend that Prince in all his campaigns. At the &s;urprize of the town of Pul|tawa in 1703, though &s;o young, he attacked &s;word in hand an old Saxon trooper, who turning about in &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;aid to him, "Thou little &s;on of a whore, what art thou already for cracking a &s;tout fellow's &s;kull?" And was going to di&s;patch the Prince, had not <HI>Charles</HI> XII. came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And af|terwards, in a dark night, the Prince riding full &s;peed before the King, &s;uddenly &s;topped at a deep pit; the King &s;uppo&s;ing it was from fear of the enemy, called out, <HI>forward, forward,</HI> upon which the Prince, re|gardle&s;s of the danger, clapped &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and fell into a pit; the King, being clo&s;e behind, had the &s;ame fate, and, with his hor&s;e, fell upon the Prince, who was half dead. This &s;o endeared him to <HI>Charles,</HI> that he &s;et up a whole night with him. At the unfortunate battle of Pultawa, he was taken pri|&s;oner. The Czar offering him a commi&s;&s;ion, his an|&s;wer
<PB N="69" REF="73">
was, "That whil&s;t he had a drop of blood, it &s;hould be employed in the &s;ervice of his Swedi&s;h maje&s;ty as his benefactor." This &s;o charmed the ge|nerous Czar, that on certain conditions he gave him his liberty, and pre&s;ented him with the &s;word he then wore. Whether from a mi&s;taken gratitude he drank too freely at taking leave of the Ru&s;&s;ians, or whether his activity in the former, fatiguing campaign had hurt his con&s;titution, this heroic Prince, on his return to his native country, was &s;eized with a fever, which proved fatal to him, in the twenty-fir&s;t year of his age, dying in the bloom of his youth, and in the certain hopes, that by his marriage with the King's &s;i&s;ter <HI>Ulrica,</HI> he &s;hould come one day to fit on the throne of Sweden.</P>
<P>Stutgard, the capital of the duchy, is not a large city, but contains two well-built &s;uburbs, and has been the re&s;idence of the dukes &s;ince 1321, the new ducal palace was built in 1746, in a delightful country, full of gardens and vineyards, in the Mi&s;en|bach (which at about one league di&s;tance, runs into the Neckar), and contains about 20,000 inhabitants. They are a hand&s;ome people. The women are tall and &s;lender, with fair and ruddy complexions. The natural riches, and the ea&s;e with which a maintenance is acquired, either in town or country, cau&s;e them to live exceedingly well. The Stutgarder is &s;o attached to his home, that remove him but thirty miles from

This edifice, were it only on account of its hall, which has few equals in all Europe, very well de&s;erves no|tice. It is two hundred and twenty feet in length, eighty broad, and ninety high, without a &s;ingle pil|lar; its roof, which is arched, being fa&s;tened in a ma&s;terly manner, with wooden &s;crews. In the year 1707, Mar&s;hal <HI>Villars,</HI> coming into this hall, mi&s;took it for a place of wor&s;hip, and &s;aid, with &s;ome admi|ration, <HI>voici un beau temple! i. e.</HI> This is a fine church! On the roof are painted &s;everal &s;criptural hi&s;tories, but on the &s;ides are views of all the fore&s;ts of the duchy of Wurtemberg, and &s;ome merry &s;cenes, which happened, at different times, in the hunting parties. Near it is the orangery, which is compo&s;ed of very large and high trees, but not well contrived; want of height occa&s;ioning many of the trees to bend at the top. The new building, as it is called, is of fine free-&s;tone, with a grand &s;tair-ca&s;e of the &s;ame, and a &s;pacious hall, who&s;e galleries re&s;t on twelve pillars of a great height; on the&s;e are painted the twelve months; the roof &s;hews the mo&s;t ancient tran&s;actions of the family of Wurtemberg, and the &s;ides are filled with ma&s;querades and public entries.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="75">In the mu&s;eum are &s;everal portraits of the ducal fami|ly, with petrifactions, mechanical and mathematical inventions, curious &s;pecimens of penman&s;hip, gems, co&s;tly ve&s;&s;els, mummies, old medals, &amp;c. Among other curio&s;ities, you &s;ee the picture of a woman with a large beard, apparently in her twenty-fifth year, and &s;he is again painted in her old age. This &s;eeming contradiction of a bearded woman is accounted an error of nature, which commonly proceeds from an exce&s;s of humidity. In this ca&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible for bearded women to enjoy a la&s;ting health, an in&s;tance of which we have in <HI>Margaret,</HI> formerly governe&s;s of the Low Countries, who&s;e great beard was a very &s;in|gular ornament to her robu&s;t &s;trength. Few traits in hi&s;tory are more known than the bearded amazon, who &s;erved as a grenadier in all the campaigns of <HI>Charles</HI> XII. of Sweden, and gave more than ma&s;culine proofs of courage till &s;he was taken pri&s;oner in the battle of Pultawa. She was brought from Siberia to Peter&s;burg, and introduced to the Czarina with a beard an ell and an half long. There is al&s;o the pic|ture of a Swi&s;s country-woman, which is drawn with a very venerable beard, to be &s;een in the Breflaw col|lection.</P>

<P><PB N="72" REF="76">The palace of Ludwig&s;burg two leagues from Stut|gard, was formerly but a farm-hou&s;e for breeding cat|tle, but is now acknowledged to be one of the fine&s;t edifices in all Germany. The looking-gla&s;s and lackered clo&s;et are very curious, and &s;o is the great &s;tair-ca&s;e for the amba&s;&s;adors, with its magnificent cieling and the gallery of pictures; among the&s;e are &s;ome admirable night-pieces, and a great many pic|tures of hor&s;es and dogs, and likewi&s;e the picture of a black wolf, which was kept for a long time at court, he was called <HI>Melac,</HI> and followed the Duke wherever he went, and even &s;lept at the foot of his bed. The chapel belonging to the palace is very elegant, but &s;omething rather too &s;mall: here is al&s;o a curious menagery of foreign fowl. The Duke's band of mu|&s;ic may be &s;aid to equal that of any court in Europe.</P>
<P>The green-hou&s;e is one of the fine&s;t to be met with any where. The Duke likewi&s;e employs con&s;iderable &s;ums of money for his &s;tuds and his hunters. He has at pre&s;ent three &s;ets of hor&s;es of eight in each &s;et, which one coachman can manage without a po&s;tilion; &s;o that, in travelling, they perform all the paces and curvettings of the manage, and &s;ometimes the Duke him&s;elf has been the coachman.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this century an order of hunt|ing was in&s;tituted in this duchy. The en&s;ign of this knighthood is a hunting-horn. One privilege of the
<PB N="73" REF="77">
companions is that they are preferred in the nomina|tion to commanderies, each of which is worth five hundred guilders. The knights of this order may be pre&s;ent at all the public entertainments, be&s;ides an unlimited number of princes and per&s;ons of high birth; this order has al&s;o twelve ancient Imperial counts, thirty knights and a &s;ecretary. The device of the order is a gold Malte&s;e cro&s;s, &s;et with rubies; four golden eagles at its four angles, and between the middle and lower point a hunting-horn; in the cen|ter is a round, green enamelled &s;hield, on one &s;ide of which is a golden W, with a ducal coronet, and on the other three golden hunting-horns &s;lung together. This cro&s;s is fa&s;tened to a crim&s;on, watered ribband of a hand's breadth, and is worn over the left &s;houlder down to the right &s;ide. On the left brea&s;t of the coat is al&s;o a &s;ilver &s;tar, with the device of the order, to|gether with it's motto <HI>Amicitiae virtuti&s;que foedus, i. e.</HI> the band of virtue and friend&s;hip; embroidered with gold in a green circle. All the knights are obliged to wear the&s;e en&s;igns of the order; tho&s;e only excepted who are of higher orders, and have already a &s;tar in that place; the&s;e, neverthele&s;s are ob&s;erved to wear the Wurtemberg &s;tar on their wai&s;tcoat, and a little cro&s;s of the order hanging on a narrow, red ribband round their neck. Every knight is to put the cro&s;s and collar of the order under the coat of arms of his family; this collar con&s;i&s;ts of green, enamelled little &s;hields, on which are alternately the golden W, with
<PB N="74" REF="78">
the ducal coronet, and three golden hunting-horns; between each &s;hield &s;tands a golden eagle with its wings extended, and its talons on each &s;hield. The fe&s;tival for a general chapter of the order is held an|nually on St. <HI>Hubert</HI>'s day, at whatever place the So|vereign happens to be, when there is always a great hunting match. The companions, who are prevented from making their appearance, are obliged, if it be any ways po&s;&s;ible, and they are not di&s;abled by &s;ick|ne&s;s or prevented by affairs of very great concern, to celebrate the day in honour of the order, wherever they are, with a hunt and other entertainments. If a knight is &s;een in public without the cro&s;s of the order, he forfeits a hand&s;ome pair of pi&s;tols to the in|former, and twenty dollars to the poor; but he who neglects to wear the order for a year and a day is de|graded.</P>
<P>The Duke of Wurtemburg has &s;everal hunting &s;eats, which he vi&s;its alternately in the deer or boar &s;ea&s;ons, &s;o that every five years he &s;ees his principal fore&s;ts. The multitude of deer in this country may be e&s;timated by con&s;idering that above &s;even thou&s;and of them peri&s;hed in one &s;ingle hard winter.</P>
<P>It is a cu&s;tom over all the country of Wurtemburg to adorn chambers and galleries with large branches of deer's horns. At Waldenburg, over mo&s;t of the remarkable branches is in&s;cribed the name of the per|&s;on
<PB N="75" REF="79">
who &s;hot the deer; and the dexterity of a late duke has filled &s;ome rooms with them. At the hunt|ing &s;eat of Ein&s;idel are two remarkable branches, which in rutting time, the deer to whom they belonged thru&s;t into each other, and twi&s;ted together with &s;uch force, that they cannot be di&s;engaged; and the creatures died on the &s;pot. The like is al&s;o &s;hewn in the royal chamber of curio&s;ities at Copenhagen. At Ein&s;idel is al&s;o a large hawthorn, grown from a twig, which was brought above two hundred years ago from the Holy|land by <HI>Everhardus Barbatus</HI> on his hat, and afterwards planted here with his own hands. In <HI>Cru&s;ius's</HI> time this &s;hrub had &s;pread to a circumference of fifty-two ells, its branches were &s;upported by forty-three pil|lars, and no &s;ingle per&s;on could gra&s;p its &s;tock.</P>
<P>In the year 1700 were found above &s;ixty different <HI>fru&s;ta</HI> of large teeth, &s;houlder-blades, ribs, and joints of back-bones, the mo&s;t remarkable of which are &s;till kept in the mu&s;eum at Stutgard; &s;ome of them appear to have belonged to fi&s;hes of prey, others to bears, tygers, lions, hor&s;es, &amp;c. and &s;ome, particularly the large&s;t teeth, to elephants. Near Boll in Wurtemberg, is found an abundance of &s;keletons, which are petrified and changed to a perfect &s;tone, who&s;e &s;pine not being tubulous, and con&s;equently without marrow, &s;hews them to have belonged to fi&s;hes.

<P>Tubingen the &s;econd city in Wurtemberg, about twenty miles from Stutgard, is of &s;uch antiquity that its aera is unkown. This place was once the &s;eat of the emperor <HI>Caracalla,</HI> who entertained the Germans with public games in this city, The high court of ju&s;tice is held here, be&s;ides the univer&s;ity, which is in great repute; there is a <HI>collegium illu&s;tre</HI> for the education of princes and young noblemen.

<P><HI>Key&s;ler</HI> relates a very &s;ingular adventure which hap|pened to a tame &s;tork that was kept &s;ome years ago in the <HI>collegio illu&s;tri.</HI> As an in&s;tance of rationality in animals, this bird had lived very quietly in the Court|yard till Count <HI>Gravenitz,</HI> a &s;tudent, &s;hot at a &s;tork's ne&s;t near the college, and mo&s;t probably wounded the &s;tork that was in it, as for &s;ome weeks after he was not &s;een to &s;tir from his ne&s;t.

of its company; but this being impracticable by rea|&s;on of its wings being clipped, the &s;tranger with the greate&s;t caution came down to the upper gallery, the next day &s;omewhat lower, and la&s;tly, after abundance of ceremonies, alighted in the court. The tame &s;tork not con&s;cious of any crime went and met him with a &s;oft chearful note, a &s;incere indication of courte&s;y and friend&s;hip, when, to his a&s;toni&s;hment, the other fell furiou&s;ly upon him. Some &s;pectators of this interview, for that time immediately put the foreign &s;tork to flight; yet was it &s;o little di&s;couraged, that the very next day, it returned to the charge, and during the whole &s;ummer frequent &s;kirmi&s;hes pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e birds; orders being given that the tame &s;tork having only one antagoni&s;t &s;hould not be a&s;&s;i&s;ted. Being thus put to its &s;hifts, it began to &s;tand better upon its guard, and made &s;uch a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance that at the end of the campaign the &s;tranger had little to boa&s;t of; but the &s;pring en&s;uing, in&s;tead of a &s;ingle &s;tork, came four, which, without any of the foregoing ceremonies, lighted at once in the college-court, and made at the tame &s;tork. This peaceable fowl, in pre|&s;ence of many &s;pectators from the galleries, performed exploits, if the expre&s;&s;ion may be permitted, above the valour of man, defending it&s;elf and a&s;&s;aulting its enemies with the mo&s;t vigorous intrepidity, till at length overpowered, and its &s;trength being &s;pent, it was falling under the redoubled &s;trokes of the enemy, when &s;ome very unexpected auxiliaries appeared.

This occa&s;ioned a &s;tricter watch to be kept again&s;t all &s;uch treacherous incur&s;ions, and a &s;top was put to any further blood-&s;hed, till in the be|ginning of the third &s;pring, above twenty &s;torks made a &s;toop into the court, and before the poor &s;tork's life|guards could form them&s;elves, or any people come to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance, murdered it; however, under &s;uch di&s;|parity, it exerted all its former heroi&s;m, and made the &s;torks pay dear for their ba&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. The ran|cour of the&s;e &s;trangers again&s;t this innocent creature could proceed only from the gun fired by Count <HI>Gravenitz,</HI> and fal&s;ely con&s;trued by them to have been done at the in&s;tigation of the tame &s;tork.</P>

In the night he was not wanting to take advantage of &s;uch a fine opportunity, and made a terrible havock among the neighbouring fowls and gee&s;e, but always took care to be at home before day-break, and immediately &s;lipt his neck into the collar again, imagining he &s;hould thus avoid the &s;u&s;picion of being thought the author of the&s;e depredations. Amid&s;t all the heavy complaints of the neighbours, the innocence of the fox &s;eemed the more certain, as <HI>Gahrliep's</HI> poultry had enjoyed an uninterrupted repo&s;e.

<P>In the di&s;trict of Urach is a curio&s;ity worth notice. In an high and &s;teep mountain near the town of Urach is the famous wood-&s;lider, which con&s;i&s;ts of one thick iron pipe, about three feet broad, two high, and about nine hundred long. This pipe begins at the top of the mountain and reaches almo&s;t down the valley near the town of Urach and the river Erms. Into its upper opening the wood, which has been felled on the mountain and cut into hillets is put, and being carried down the pipe, is thrown into the river Erms, which forwards it into the Neckar, and by this means furni&s;hes Stutgard with fuel at a &s;mall expence; not|with&s;tanding the great impetuo&s;ity with which it mu&s;t naturally move in coming from an eminence above

They di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves from their neighbours by a mo&s;t frightful ta&s;te in dre&s;s, and a &s;hocking want of cleanline&s;s. I am not able, he adds, to account for the ugline&s;s of this peo|ple. Need, labour, and little food may contribute to it, but cannot be the only rea&s;on; for in the country of <HI>Fur&s;temberg,</HI> and particularly in the Au&s;trian parts of this great chain of hills, are very hand&s;ome people who do not &s;eem to live better than the Wirtembergers. Po&s;&s;ibly the ugline&s;s of the latter may be owing to the &s;ituation and depth of the vallies, to the air and per|haps to the water. The&s;e journies, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> over the mountains had particular charms for me. I fan|cied my&s;elf in a new world. One enchanting pro&s;pect &s;ucceeded another in variety and beauty, mountains and chains of mountains of the mo&s;t extraordinary forms, cataracts, woods, &s;mall lakes in the deep hollows, precipices, in &s;hort every thing I &s;aw, was in &s;o grand a &s;tile as to exceed all de&s;cription. The Duke of Wir|temberg enjoys one very great privilege that there lies no appeal from his courts of judicature to the Aulic or
<PB N="82" REF="87">
any other foreign tribunal. He &s;its and votes in the college of princes by virtue of the duchy of Wirtem|berg and has demanded the &s;ame privilege as duke of Teck. This is an old ca&s;tle now in ruins with a town adjoining. The fir&s;t duke of Teck, known with any certainty, lived towards the end of the twelfth century. The duke's title, is duke of Wirtemberg and Teck, count of Mompelgard, lord of Heydenheim and Ju&s;|tinjen. He is joint director of the circle of Swabia with the bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance.</P>
<P>His office in the empire is to carry the Imperial &s;tandard; this office of &s;tandard-bearer of the Holy Roman empire, was conferred on the Counts of Wirtemberg in 1336. The dukes of Wirtemberg are al&s;o grand hunt&s;men of the empire; and in al|lu&s;ion to this honour, Duke <HI>Eberhard Lewis,</HI> in 1702, founded the order of hunting, of which we have already treated, and in the year 1719, renewed and increa&s;ed its &s;tatutes, the reigning duke of Wir|temberg being always grand-ma&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>The MARGRAVATE of BADEN.</HEAD>
<P>Is about ninety miles in length, but not above twenty in breadth. It lies near the banks of the Rhine, and extends from Bale almo&s;t to Philip&s;burg, and from thence, through part of Al&s;ace to the Mo&s;elle. It produces corn, hemp, flax, turnips,
<PB N="83" REF="88">
pea&s;e, and other vegetables; and the villages along the <HI>Rhine</HI> abound in hay, and breed great quantities of cattle, be&s;ides which they enjoy the conveniency of good fi&s;heries in the <HI>Rhine.</HI> Veni&s;on and wild fowl are &s;o plentiful in the fore&s;ts, that it is the ordinary food of the pea&s;ants; and they have woods of che&s;nuts, where there are very excellent bacon-hogs. Here are al&s;o quarries of marble of all colours, and free|&s;tone, with which materials the inhabitants build magnificent hou&s;es at a trifling expence. They carry on a large trade in cattle, wood and wine, which la&s;t is extremely good in the environs of Bale. The mildne&s;s of the government &s;ecures to the people, the quiet enjoyment of the rewards of their indu&s;try. There are not indeed opportunities of making great fortunes, as the court is very economical, but the &s;ame cau&s;e prevents the pre&s;&s;ure of extreme poverty. The felicity of exporting merchandize by the navi|gation on the Rhine, is a great incitement to indu&s;|try. The manufactures in con&s;equence, increa&s;e every year, and &s;ome of them, particularly that of ear|then ware, at Durloch, are in high e&s;timation. They have likewi&s;e made &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful experiments in manufacturing of &s;ilk.</P>
<P>The Prince, in &s;hort, endeavours by every po&s;&s;ible means to introduce indu&s;try, and manufactories among his &s;ubjects. There are a con&s;iderable number of Engli&s;h trade&s;men here, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> who make Bir|mingham

work, and in&s;truct the inhabitants in that bu&s;ine&s;s. He has al&s;o engaged many watchmakers from Geneva to &s;ettle here, by granting them en|couragment, and privileges of every kind, and al|lows no opportunity to &s;lip, by which he can pro|mote the comfort, and happine&s;s of his people: a prince of &s;uch a character is certainly a public ble&s;|&s;ing, and the people are fortunate who are born un|der his government. But far more fortunate they, who are born under a government, which can protect them, independent of the virtues, and in &s;pite of their Sovereign.</P>
<P>Baden, the capital of the marqui&s;ate, takes it name from the multitude of hot baths about it, which are &s;aid to amount to near three hundred. The town is &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of vineyards, upon a moun|tainous rocky ground, which renders the &s;treets very uneven. The baths are &s;calding hot, and as they i&s;&s;ue from rocks of &s;alt, allum and brim&s;tone, ta&s;te &s;trongly of tho&s;e minerals. One of them boils and bubbles up, as if it &s;tood over a hot furnace. A|mong other di&s;tempers, the&s;e waters are famous for curing the cramp and gout, which brings a great re&s;ort of company to this place, during the &s;ummer months. The only public buildings, are the ca&s;tle, built on an adjoining hill, and a palace belonging to the Margrave, which, however, is uninhabited. The re&s;idence of the court being principally at Carl&s;rube.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="90">The town of Carl&s;rube is well built on a regular plan. It con&s;i&s;ts of one principal &s;treet of about an Engli&s;h mile in length. This &s;treet is at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance in front of the palace, and in a paral|lel direction with it. All the other &s;treets go off at different angles from the principal one, in &s;uch a man|ner as, that which ever of them you enter, walking from it, the view is terminated by the front of the pa|lace. The length of their &s;maller &s;treets is a&s;certain|ed, none of them being allowed to encroach on the &s;pacious area, which is kept clear before the palace.</P>
<P>The principal &s;treet may be extended to any length, and as many additional &s;treets as they plea&s;e may be built from it, all of which will have, according to this plan, the palace for termination.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es of this town are as uniform as the &s;treets, being all of an equal &s;ize and height; &s;o as to give the appearance, that none of the inhabi|tants are in any con&s;iderable degree richer or poorer than their neighbours. There are, indeed, a few new hou&s;es more elegant than the re&s;t, which be|long to &s;ome of the officers of the court, and are built on one &s;ide of the palace; but they are not, properly &s;peaking, in the town.</P>
<P>It &s;tands in the middle of a large fore&s;t, the rem|nant of that, which in the time of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> covered
<PB N="86" REF="91">
all Germany. Through this fore&s;t there are thirty-two regular avenues, extending to a great di&s;tance; and the town which is built in the &s;hape of a fan, &s;tands upon nine of the&s;e. The fir&s;t &s;tone of the palace was laid in 1715, half of the right wing is wanting, the building having for &s;ome years been di&s;continued. The fir&s;t object of attention here, and for which no expence has been thought too great, is the turret on the body of the building, from whence we have not only a view of all the principal &s;treets, but al&s;o of five and twenty walks, &s;ome &s;et with trees, and others cut through the woods, which no other princes &s;eat can rival, and &s;till heightened by a pro&s;pect of other variegated walks in the &s;ame woods. Some of the&s;e walks bear the names of tho&s;e mini&s;ters who &s;erved his highne&s;s at the time of the&s;e improvements; and the &s;treets in the town are called by the names of different German princes. The gar|den, though &s;mall, is very elegant, and contains above four thou&s;and orange, lemon, bay, and other &s;uch kind of trees.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the lower parts of the garden, are e&s;pa|liers of young lemon trees; here is al&s;o an aviary for three hundred canary-birds, which in &s;ummer-time u&s;ed to fly about the gardens all day, and at night re|pair to their habitation. Behind the palace is a decoy, where above two thou&s;and wild fowl are daily fed. The chief defect in Carl&s;rube is want of water. The
<PB N="87" REF="92">
neighbouring country is a &s;andy level, which in &s;um|mer makes travelling very di&s;agreeable. All the wa|ter for the garden is conveyed by hand-pumps, but what is mo&s;t &s;ingular, is, that the whole town con&s;i&s;ts entirely of wooden buildings.</P>
<P>A traveller who pa&s;&s;ed through it, expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urprize one day to the Margrave, to &s;ee a palace en|tirely of wood.

The fact is, the debts of the family were numerous and great. Tho&s;e in the here|ditary dominions have ari&s;en from frequent wars, and the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion for the younger branches of the family; and in the la&s;t admini&s;tration, every thing had been &s;uffered to go to ruin, becau&s;e the &s;ucce&s;&s;or was a prote&s;tant. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the Prince's mother carried her economy &s;o far, as to cau&s;e the flowers which grew in the gardens of the palace to be &s;old, in&s;tead of permitting her daughters to wear them in their bo&s;oms. For this, though without the &s;tricte&s;t economy, the family mu&s;t have been ruined, &s;he was laughed at, perhaps in &s;ome degree, not unde&s;er|vedly.</P>

<P>After the electors, and the hou&s;es of Wurtemburg, and He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, the Margrave of Baden is one of the greate&s;t potentates in Germany. His reve|nues
<PB N="90" REF="95">
are about one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds a year. 'I reckon,' &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> <Q>the few days I &s;pent at Carl&s;rube among the happie&s;t of my life. I &s;aw a prince who truly lives only for his peo|ple, and &s;eeks for his happine&s;s in theirs; one who&s;e active and enlightened mind, pervades the whole country, and by its influence, makes all tho&s;e who have a &s;hare in the admini&s;tration, patriots like him&s;elf. Education, police, encouragement to in|du&s;try, and agriculture; every thing, in &s;hort, here, breathes a &s;pirit of philo&s;ophy, and the warm love of mankind.</Q> <Q>O that I could make,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>many millions as happy, as the Margrave of Baden makes two hundred thou&s;and men.</Q> He adds, the Mar|grave is as amiable in private life, as he is re&s;pectable in public, and the margravine is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every po|lite accompli&s;hment; &s;o that the court, to which &s;trangers ea&s;ily get admi&s;&s;ion, is the be&s;t &s;ociety in Carl&s;rube.</P>
<P>The German princes are minute ob&s;ervers of form. The &s;ame e&s;tabli&s;hment for their hou&s;hold, and the like number of officers in their palaces are to be found among them, as in the court of the mo&s;t powerful monarch of Europe. The difference lies more in the &s;alaries, than in the talents requi&s;ite for the&s;e places; one payma&s;ter of the forces in England, has greater emoluments, than a grand marechal, a grand chamberlain, two &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, and
<PB N="91" REF="96">
half a dozen more of the chief officers of a Ger|man court.</P>
<P>The Margrave of Baden, like every other &s;overeign prince in Germany, has body-guards, who do duty in the palace; foot-guards, who parade before it, al&s;o hor&s;e-guards and hu&s;&s;ars, all of whom are perfectly well equipped, and exactly di&s;ciplined; a piece of magnificence, which &s;eems to be adopted by this prince, merely in conformity with the cu&s;tom long e&s;tabli&s;hed in this country.</P>
<P>He keeps on foot no other troops be&s;ides the few which are nece&s;&s;ary for this duty at the palace, though his revenue is more con&s;iderable, and his finances are in much better order than tho&s;e of &s;ome princes in Ger|many, who have little &s;tanding armies in con&s;tant pay. He has too ju&s;t an under&s;tanding, not to perceive, that the greate&s;t army he could po&s;&s;ibly maintain, could be no defence to his dominions, &s;ituated as they are between the powerful &s;tates of France and Au&s;tria; and probably his principles and di&s;po&s;ition prevent him from thinking of filling his coffers by letting out his &s;ubjects to foreign powers.</P>
<P>If he was &s;o inclined, there is no doubt that he might &s;ell the per&s;ons of his &s;ubjects as &s;oldiers, or employ them in any other way he might think pro|per; for he, as well as other &s;overeign princes in
<PB N="92" REF="97">
Germany, has an unlimited power over his people. If you a&s;k the que&s;tion, in direct terms, of a German; he will an&s;wer in the negative, and will talk of certain rights which the &s;ubjects enjoy, and that they can ap|peal to the great council, or general diet of the em|pire for relief. But after all his ingenuity and di&s;|tinctions, you find that the barriers which protect the pea&s;ant from the power of the prince, are &s;o very weak, that they are hardly worth keeping up; and that the only &s;ecurity the pea&s;ant has for his per&s;on or property, mu&s;t proceed from the moderation, good &s;en&s;e, and ju&s;tice of his &s;overeign.</P>
<P>Happy, adds <HI>Moore</HI> with <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> would it be for mankind, if this unlimited power were always placed in as equitable hands as tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent Margrave of Baden, who employs it entirely for the good of his &s;ubjects, by whom he is adored!</P>
<P>Among his other e&s;tabli&s;hments, a late margrave had the following &s;ingular one: and this was a noto|rious &s;eminary of young women, where, by an unna|tural whim of his, above thirty female creatures were maintained, &s;ome of whom were always walking by his coach in the garb of hey dukes, and others at night, keeping guard in the palace. The general provi&s;ion for them on their di&s;charge, was to be mar|ried to &s;ome petty officer of the hou&s;hold.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="98">Self-love has ever &s;hewn great addre&s;s in recon|ciling licentious inclinations, with religion, and in making a compact, as it were, with God, by which favourite vices are retained, and all due homage paid to the Deity in other re&s;pects. The voluptuous comfort them&s;elves with the numerous concubines of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon,</HI> and imagine God will not be &s;o &s;trict, but that a punctual ob&s;ervance of many exter|nal duties, will compen&s;ate for giving way to &s;ome one frailty; but this too, mu&s;t be &s;uch as &s;uits their natural di&s;po&s;ition.

<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of CONSTANCE.</HEAD>
<P>The lands and e&s;tates of the bi&s;hopric of Con&s;tance lie on both &s;ides of the lake. Meadow-grounds and ploughed-lands turn to very little account here; the &s;oil being clayey, &s;andy, or mar&s;hy, and &s;ubject to inundations. In the towns and villages the only traffic carried on is in wine, but this amounts to nothing con&s;iderable. This bi&s;hopric has ever been an im|mediate &s;tate of the empire, and as &s;uch the Bi&s;hop

<P>The Boden&s;ee, or lake of Con&s;tance, is in length about eighteen leagues. It is divided into two parts, that part from Bregentz to Con&s;tance, being called the upper lake, and that from Con&s;tance to Zell, the lower lake. The latter is between twenty and thirty fathoms deep, and reckons along its banks near forty cities, towns, and villages; yet the upper lake &s;urpa&s;&s;es it, having no le&s;s than fifty, and the depth of it in &s;ome places is &s;aid to be three hundred and fifty fathoms; its greate&s;t breadth, is between Buchorn and Ro&s;back which lie at the di&s;tance of five leagues from each other. This is by much the large&s;t lake in Germany. The <HI>Rhine</HI> which runs through this lake has &s;o &s;trong a current, that it is &s;aid it does not mix with the waters of the lake. Near Lindau and Brugentz, be&s;ides the fi&s;h u&s;ually caught in the&s;e parts, there is al&s;o a kind of &s;almon-trouts which being taken and pickled, when full grown are exported as a great rarity. They are
<PB N="95" REF="100">
generally an ell and an half or two ells long, weigh|ing between thirty and forty pounds. As the fi&s;hermen cannot always make a market of &s;uch large fi&s;h, they tie a bit of wood to a line, which having pa&s;&s;ed through the fi&s;h's gills, or the hinder part of the head clo&s;e up to the wood, they fa&s;ten the other end of the line to a &s;take on the &s;hore, near their huts: thus, without any danger of lo&s;ing it, they can allow the fi&s;h a range of thirty or forty paces to &s;wim in, and keep it alive and &s;ound, till they meet with a com|pany of purcha&s;ers, or have an opportunity of &s;el|ling it for &s;ome marriage, or other great entertainment, where a fi&s;h of that &s;ize is required.</P>
<P>The city of Con&s;tance is well built, populous, and finely &s;ituated, it lies on the other &s;ide of the Rhine, over which there is a large wooden bridge, and near it the river turns &s;everal mills. The fortification of the city are &s;ufficient to defend it well. Here are two mar|kets every week, to which the people of the towns and villages near the lake re&s;ort with their goods. The town is not very large, but it has a tolerable trade, from the convenience of water-carriage along the lake and the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>

An order of the bi&s;hop of Con|&s;tance, having prohibited &s;uch miracles in his dio|ce&s;e, found him taking refuge under the prelate of Salman&s;weiler, who by the &s;trength of hard gold, always purcha&s;es of the Pope, an exemption from the bi&s;hop's power. In oppo&s;ition to the bi&s;hop, the prelate e&s;pou&s;ed the part of the refugee with much warmth; and his fortune was made by the per|&s;ecution he underwent. The prelate's &s;teward, &s;up|plied him with barrels of &s;tinking oil, and other com|modities, which he u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of his cures, and in the furni&s;hing of which the other found his account.</P>
<P>They little think in Holland, how much they owe to the lake of Con&s;tance. As matters are at pre&s;ent, they can hardly guard again&s;t the &s;and, which being wa&s;hed down from the Alps by the Aar, and other rivers, threatens to &s;top up the mouth of the Rhine, and already leaves room to conjecture &s;ome violent revolution by the &s;and-banks it has rai&s;ed. And if the re&s;ervoir we &s;peak of, did not interrupt by far the greate&s;t quantity of &s;and, which the rapid &s;tream
<PB N="99" REF="104">
of the Rhine wa&s;hes from the high Buntmerland; Holland mu&s;t have been before this time, buried un|der a new &s;and, and the cour&s;e of the Rhine being altered, would have totally changed the figure of that country. It is true, the&s;e changes mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily happen; as however con&s;iderable the depth of this lake be, it mu&s;t at la&s;t be filled up, and the &s;ooner, becau&s;e the &s;tream, as it flows from Con&s;tance, through the upper parts of Germany, is always deepen|ing its bed, and the lake lo&s;es exactly as much water as it gains in &s;and. On the other hand, if we reflect how much &s;o great a ba&s;on as this lake may contain; and calculate its contents, as de la <HI>Torre</HI> did tho&s;e of Ve&s;uvius, we &s;hall think the Dutch are &s;ecure for many generations.</P>
<P>Uberlingen, a city on the lake, ten miles north|ea&s;t of Con&s;tance, &s;ituate on the top of a rock, and &s;urrounded with vineyards, was thought &s;o plea&s;ant by the ancient dukes of Suabia, that they made it their u&s;ual re&s;idence. It has a very good trade, and is famous for its mineral waters, which cure the &s;tone, and other di&s;tempers, and in twice or thrice wa&s;hing, take away all warts. The ho&s;pital in this town, is the be&s;t endowed in all Suabia; and the people &s;o rich, that they con&s;titute as much to the general charges of the empire as many of the princes.</P>

Several jewellers have offered fifty thou&s;and guilders a pound for it; in the church of this abbey lies the above-mentioned liberal emperor, once &s;o powerful and glorious, but after|wards for&s;aken by every one, &s;o that he died in ex|treme indigence in the year 888.</P>

<P>In the cloi&s;ters of this abbey, is the picture of a nobleman, who died in 1675, in the 70th year of his age; with a beard reaching to his knees; this puts me in mind, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> of a Flemi&s;h painter, named <HI>John Meyo,</HI> who&s;e beard was of &s;uch a length, that when he &s;tooped, he could tread upon it, and this peculiarity occa&s;ioned him to be nick-named <HI>Johannes Barbatus.</HI></P>

marry her. This kind of gallantry they look upon as very innocent, and are &s;o &s;trongly attached to it, that when, a few years ago, government was for &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing &s;uch a &s;candalous practice; it was nearly occa|&s;ioning an in&s;urrection, and the di&s;pute is not yet terminated.</P>
<P>Aug&s;burg, is a free Imperial city, lies in a delightful country between the rivers Lock and Wertach, which unite not far from this place. It is a large populous well built city, e&s;teemed the capital of Suabia, furni&s;hed with many noble fountains, adorned with brazen &s;ta|tues of ancient heroes and emperors, and likewi&s;e with &s;ome valuable monuments of antiquity. The burghers are reckoned to be 6000; the council is mix|ed, and con&s;i&s;ts of an equal number of reformed, and papi&s;ts. The profe&s;&s;ors of both religions are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable by their dre&s;s. Aug&s;burg, was formerly the mo&s;t con&s;iderable city in all Germany for commerce, but the declen&s;ion of the trade of Venice was a &s;evere &s;troke to it.</P>
<P>The town hou&s;e, is accounted the fine&s;t in all Germany, the entrance is of poli&s;hed red mar|ble, &s;upported by two pillars of white. The cham|bers contain abundance of hi&s;torical and political paintings, with well cho&s;en apothegms, exhorting the judges to impartial ju&s;tice, to prudence, peace, and the fear of God. The whole breadth of it is one

hundred and forty &s;even feet; its length is one hun|dred and ten; and its height one hundred and &s;eventy five feet. It was completed in 1620, after having been &s;ix years in building. Its principal or|nament, is con&s;idered to be a &s;aloon of fine pictures, in the third &s;tory, which is fifty two feet high, fif|ty eight broad, and one hundred and ten in length, without any pillars to it, and &s;urrounded on both &s;ides by the four princes rooms, as they are called, which are al&s;o exqui&s;itely painted. Near the town hou&s;e, &s;tands the lofty tower of Perlachthurm. This tower is three hundred &s;teps high, and the woman which &s;tands above the weather cock is as big as life. In an area adjoining to the tower, is a very fine foun|tain, with the four &s;ea&s;ons in bra&s;s, and in the cen|tre, the emperor <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> with appo&s;ite in&s;criptions. The palaces of the count de <HI>Fugger,</HI> are very mag|nificent. The Fuggery, as it is called, con&s;i&s;ts of 106 &s;mall hou&s;es, erected in 1519, by the family of the Fuggers, lords of the adjacent country, for the reception of poor burgers, who have annual pen&s;ions &s;ettled on them. On the fine, and well con|trived aqueducts for the conveyance of water here, from the Loch are &s;everal corn, &s;awing, flatting and melting mills, but the water-works in particular are remarkable here, which from five towers convey the water in &s;uch a manner, through the city, that not only five large, and beautiful fountains with other public re&s;ervoirs, but al&s;o the greate&s;t part of the

hou&s;es are &s;upplied by means of the&s;e works, with that element in plenty. It is &s;urrounded with very fine pa&s;ture land, beautiful and fertile plains, and with large fore&s;ts full of all &s;orts of game. There are more Lutherans than Catholics in this city, who live together in tolerable harmony; their poor are pro|vided for in the &s;ame ho&s;pital, and to avoid giving of|fence, the Lutherans &s;tand with their hats off when the ho&s;t goes by. There is no place where the citizens have their dre&s;&s;es &s;o varied, which is &s;o re|gulated by the magi&s;trates, that every per&s;on of qua|lity and religion may be known by it.</P>
<P>In the bi&s;hop's palace, which is otherwi&s;e an in|&s;ignificant building, is the hall, in which the pro|te&s;tant princes pre&s;ented their confe&s;&s;ion of faith to the emperor Charles V. in the diet, held here <HI>anno.</HI> 1530, and from thence called the Aug&s;burg Confe&s;&s;ion, which occa&s;ioned a civil war in the empire that la&s;ted &s;ome years; but it was at la&s;t agreed, in a &s;ub&s;equent diet, held in the year 1555, that the prote&s;tants &s;hould enjoy the free exerci&s;e of their religion throughout the empire. The magi&s;trates have &s;ince been com|po&s;ed of an equal number of prote&s;tants and catho|lics, their &s;enate con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-three Roman ca|tholics, and twenty-two Lutherans, and their com|mon council of an hundred and fifty of each; the executive power is in the &s;enate, and the legi&s;lative authority in both bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="109">The fortifications of this town are not very &s;trong. The duke of Bavaria took this city in 1704, after a &s;iege of thirteen days; and after the lo&s;s of the bat|tle of Hoch&s;tadt, the &s;ame year, he withdrew his gar|ri&s;on, not thinking it any longer tenable.</P>

<P>The monks of St. Ulrich di&s;po&s;e of a du&s;t or pow|der, called St. Ulrich's earth, recommending it by the name of that holy man, who is &s;aid to have bani&s;hed all the rats out of the city, and neighbourhood into a hole, which is to this day &s;hewn in the church, and dedicated to this &s;aint. The du&s;t is dug up from the place where he was buried.

pepper-corn. Aug&s;burg, like Nuremberg, has always been famous for ingenious arti&s;ts. An incredible quantity of Turki&s;h, as it is called, and other &s;orts of gold and &s;ilver paper is made here. The fine&s;t &s;ilver work is imitated in pewter, but if in a hundred weight, there be but &s;o much as half an ounce of lead, the de&s;ign fails. This incomparable pewter is, at the &s;ame time, &s;o &s;olid and hard, that &s;nips of common pewter may be melted in it over the fire.</P>
<P>Among the public buildings, the einlea&s;s, <HI>i.e.</HI> admit|tance, as it is called, is a very ingenious work; it &s;aves the trouble and danger they had formerly of opening the city gates at night for travellers or cou|riers, and may be made &s;o, that many per&s;ons can come into the city at once, either hor&s;e or foot. To this end, a bridge goes up and down, and as often as a gate &s;huts, another opens with a great noi&s;e, and no|thing can be better contrived for &s;ecurity and conve|nience.</P>
<P>Another curious thing is the engine, which by means of twenty-eight &s;prings, one of which is bra&s;s, the water is rai&s;ed up to three towers. The city al&s;o is not without its fine gardens.

<P><HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> remarks, that Aug&s;burg is one of the olde&s;t towns in Germany, and one of the mo&s;t remarkable, as it is there and at Nuremberg, we meet with the olde&s;t marks of German art and indu&s;try. In the four|teenth and fifteenth centuries, the commerce of this town was the mo&s;t exten&s;ive of any part of South Ger|many; and contributed much to the civilization of the country, by the works of art and variety of nece&s;&s;aries to the comfort and convenience of life, which it was the means of introducing. Many things originated in this town, which have had great influence on the hap|pine&s;s of mankind. Not to mention the many impor|tant diets of the empire held here. It was in this city, that in 952, a council confirmed the order for the celibacy of prie&s;ts; in 1530, as we have already men|tioned, was the confe&s;&s;ion of faith of the prote&s;tants, laid before the emperor, and other &s;tates of Germany; in 1555, the famous treaty of peace was &s;igned, by which religious liberty was &s;ecured to Germany.</P>
<P>Many of the hou&s;es, according to <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> are old
<PB N="108" REF="113">
and ugly, and are built with &s;o little attention to the rules of modern ta&s;te, that <HI>Winkleman</HI> renounced liv|ing in Germany, after he had &s;een them. The hou&s;es in Aug&s;burg mu&s;t not be con&s;idered as Roman and Greek temples, but as monuments of the architec|ture of the times in which they were built. Who|ever con&s;iders them in that light, and compares them with the hou&s;es built at Lubec and Nuremberg, in the &s;ame century, will &s;ee to how much greater mag|nificence Aug&s;burg had arrived in tho&s;e early times. He will &s;ee too, a great deal of real beauty of pro|portion, and corre&s;pondence of parts, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The looks of the inhabitants of Aug&s;burg, have &s;omething very &s;triking in them. They are a com|pound of the Suabian and Bavarian features. The prote&s;tants are mo&s;t like the Suabians, and the catho|lics like the Bavarians. It is an ob&s;ervation, which has been frequently made, and undoubtedly a true one, that we may di&s;tingui&s;h a prote&s;tant of Aug&s;|burg from a catholic, by his looks and manner. Any per&s;on who goes into their re&s;pective churches, will &s;ee &s;triking characteri&s;tic differences in their counte|nance. As the catholics are more rigid at Aug&s;burg than el&s;ewhere, and the followers of the different &s;ects &s;eldom intermarrying, this difference may the more ea&s;ily be accounted for.</P>
<P>The police of the place continues <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> is very
<PB N="109" REF="114">
good, and though the town has no territory, it has no debts. The water-works at Aug&s;burg are more admired than tho&s;e of Marly, their mechanici&s;m is much more &s;imple, and the utility of them, much more con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>Aug&s;burg, however, is no longer what it was. It has no longer a <HI>Fugger</HI> and a <HI>Wel&s;er</HI> to lend millions to the emperor. In this large and hand&s;ome town, though formerly one of the greate&s;t trading towns in Germany, there are no merchants at pre&s;ent, who&s;e capitals exceed 20,000l. The others, mo&s;t of whom mu&s;t have their coaches, go creeping on with &s;mall capitals of 3 or 4000l. and do the bu&s;ine&s;s of bankers and commi&s;&s;ioners. Some hou&s;es, however, carry on a little banking trade; and the way through Tyrol and Graubundten, occa&s;ions &s;ome little exchange be|tween this place and Germany.</P>
<P>After the&s;e brokers and doers of bu&s;ine&s;s by com|mi&s;&s;ion, the engravers, &s;tatuaries, and painters, are the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of the labouring part of the city. Their productions, like the toys of Nuremberg, go every where. They have always &s;ome people of ge|nius among&s;t them; but the &s;mall demand for their labours, affords them &s;o little encouragement, that to prevent &s;tarving, they are mo&s;tly confined to the &s;mall religious works, which are done el&s;ewhere by the capuchin monks. They furni&s;h all Germany with
<PB N="110" REF="115">
little pictures for prayer-books, and to hang in citizens hou&s;es. Indeed, the arts meet with little &s;upport in this country. In other provinces of Germany, mat|ters appear to be no better ordered; <HI>Mengs, Winckel|man, Gluck, Ha&s;&s;e, Handel, Haydon,</HI> and many others, were obliged to acquire reputation abroad, before their merits were acknowledged at home.</P>
<P>There is an academy of arts in&s;tituted here, under the protection of the magi&s;trates. It &s;eems, however, like its patrons, to have no other aim, than to produce good mechanics, and pre&s;erve the manufacturers of the city. The &s;enate, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, has been deliberating on &s;imilar projects for the encouragement of indu&s;try. As I take part in any improvement for &s;ocial happine&s;s, I was extremely mortified, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> to &s;ee that three good intentions were thwarted by the very governors of the town them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The grounds of this oppo&s;ition ari&s;e chiefly from the form of government. The patricians, who, with a very &s;mall addition of the mercantile part, govern the town ari&s;tocratically, cannot bear to &s;ee the plebiean enabled, by his indu&s;try, to carry his head above them. This de&s;picable policy, takes its origin in the general corruption of the country. Nine-tenths of the inhabitants, are the mo&s;t infamous ra&s;cals imaginable; fellows, who, on the lea&s;t &s;ignal, are ready to cut each others' throats, on account of religion; who &s;pend
<PB N="111" REF="116">
their weekly wages every Sunday in ale-hou&s;es, and never reflect on the greatne&s;s of their predece&s;&s;ors, but when the liquor is fermenting in their heads. It is impo&s;&s;ible to give any idea of all the ridiculous inci|dents occa&s;ioned by religious di&s;putes. Every day produces &s;ome occurrence, which makes one both laugh and complain. They never bru&s;h a cobweb from a public building without mingling religion in the bu&s;ine&s;s. The catholics, who are more zealous than the prote&s;tants &s;upport a controver&s;ial preacher here, as they do in all the towns where the religion is of a mixed kind. This man, at certain times, &s;ets one half of Aug&s;burg a laughing, the other a raving. He who filled this part when <HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> was there, was an Ex-je&s;uit; who was one of the be&s;t comedians of the kind he had &s;een. The exce&s;&s;ive poverty and indolence of the people, makes them regardle&s;s of their rights: the ari&s;tocracy would not be &s;o powerful, if the people had more attachment to their con&s;titution. But <HI>liberty,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Rie&s;bec,</HI> is no dearer to them, than the cha&s;tity of their daughters whom their canons, (who&s;e incomes are about 200l. per annum) purcha&s;e every year by dozens.</P>
<P>The other tenth of the inhabitants, con&s;i&s;t of &s;ome patrician families, among whom there are &s;ome very polite people, merchants, arti&s;ts and clergy. The town, which is 9 miles and half round, contains hardly 30,000 people, and their collective capital, &s;carely exceeds
<PB N="112" REF="117">
1,500,000l. &s;o that their yearly decrea&s;e becomes more apparent. Should &s;ome fortunate circum&s;tances not ari&s;e, another century will &s;ee them reduced to beg|gary. M. <HI>Nicolai</HI> makes the number of habitants 34 or 35,000 and &s;ays, there are 28,000 hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The more modern part of this town is truly beau|tiful; we are led to believe. that in proportion as the internal re&s;ources dimini&s;hed, the magi&s;tracy became more attentive to external decoration; but it is, as with the fal&s;e bloom on a courtezan's cheek, it may be|guile the pa&s;&s;ing &s;tranger, but whoever &s;ees her at her toilet, will &s;oon be undeceived.</P>
<P>The city has its water for the table from the river Loch, which runs at &s;ome di&s;tance from the town. The aqueducts conveying it, are much to be admired. As the court of Bavaria has it in its power to cut off this indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ary of life; by threatening the town with &s;o doing, it often lays it under contribution. But having be&s;ides this, other means of keeping the high-council in a &s;tate of dependance; to &s;ecure it&s;elf from this oppre&s;&s;ion, it &s;o &s;eeks the Emperors protec|tion, as to become wholly dependent on him, and is there as it were banded about by both courts. The Emperor's mini&s;ter to the circle of Suabia, generally re&s;ides in this town, which &s;ecures to his court a per|petual influence with the magi&s;tracy. There are Au&s;|trian and Pru&s;&s;ian recruiting parties quartered here,
<PB N="113" REF="118">
and the partiality of the government to the former, is very remarkable. In the war of 1756, the citizens were divided into equal parties for the two courts. The Catholics con&s;idered the emperor as their god; and the prote&s;tants did the &s;ame by the king of Pru&s;|&s;ia. The flame of religion con&s;equently had very much kindled a civil war among&s;t them.</P>
<P>Ulm is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable city in Suabia. It lies on an uneven &s;pot of ground, on the Danube, where that river unites with the Iler, and fir&s;t becomes navi|gable for ve&s;&s;els of con&s;iderable burthen. This city is &s;ituated forty miles we&s;t of Aug&s;burg, but the road, for the mo&s;t part, is &s;o &s;andy, and the &s;econd &s;tage &s;o tedious, by means of the &s;loughs, that it takes up nine hours to perform the journey.</P>
<P>Compared to the neighbouring cities, it is well fortified; they have here a very particular cu&s;tom, which is not to &s;uffer &s;trangers to go on the ramparts, without paying a guilder. All the burgers are under the &s;ame re&s;traint, the privilege of walking free, being allowed only to the patricians and their friends. This does not proceed &s;o much from an apprehen&s;ion of any clande&s;tine corre&s;pondence, as from avarice; for the&s;e patricians &s;hare the hay and fruit growing on the ramparts among them&s;elves, which makes them cau|tious again&s;t whatever may occa&s;ion any diminution of their profit. That which engages the attention of
<PB N="114" REF="119">
travellers, in this city, is the cathedral, not to be equalled by any in Germany, that of Stra&s;burg ex|cepted. The &s;teeple is four hundred and one &s;teps high; nothing can be finer than the pro&s;pects from the top of it, the whole country round it being en|tirely level. In ca&s;e of fire, e&s;pecially from lightning, &s;ixty-three large copper kettles always filled with wa|ter are hung up in different parts of the tower, and on the roof of the church, with a machine for drawing up provi&s;ions for the watchmen in the tower. There is a very hand&s;ome &s;tone-bridge here over the Danube, which greatly favours the trade of the inhabitants in linen, fu&s;tians, hardware and wool. It is one of the large&s;t and be&s;t built places in Germany, and the town-hou&s;e is a very hand&s;ome edifice. Large quan|tities of wine are brought here from the Rhine, the Neckar, and from Con&s;tance, to be tran&s;ported down the Danube. The Reformation prevailed here about the year 1529, and the magi&s;trates, as well as the in|habitants are mo&s;tly Lutherans. The city of Ulm, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> is however very far from being what it formerly was, when it u&s;ed to be a common &s;aying, <Q>The lords of Ulm, the merchants of Nuremberg, and the burgers of Aug&s;burg.</Q> And this &s;aying al|&s;o, was equally current, <Q>The power of Venice, the ingenuity of Nuremberg, and the fire-arms of Stra&s;|burg; let the world &s;hew the like.</Q> But this declen|&s;ion is not the peculiar misfortune of Ulm: many other Imperial free-towns, join in the like complaint.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="120">Of all the circles of the Empire, Suabia is the mo&s;t divided, it contains four eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and thirteen lay-principalities, nineteen independant prelacies and ab|bies, twenty-&s;ix earldoms and lord&s;hips, and thirty-one free cities. The prime directors of the circle are the bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance and the duke of Wirtem|berg, which la&s;t has the &s;ole direction of all that re|lates to military concerns.</P>
<P>The mixture of the various forms of government and religious &s;ects; the oppre&s;&s;ion exerci&s;ed by the greater over the le&s;&s;er; the game con&s;tantly played by the Emperor, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many pieces of detached country in Suabia, which depend not on the circle, and can in con&s;equence of his privileges as archduke of Au&s;tria, extend his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in it by various ways, are circum&s;tances which give the cultivation of the country, and the character of the inhabitants, a mo&s;t extraordinary ca&s;t.</P>
<P>In &s;everal of the port-towns, the highe&s;t degree of cultivation may be &s;een in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t &s;a|vage wildne&s;s; a great degree of knowledge and po|li&s;h of manners, mixed with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition; traces of liberty, under the deepe&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion; national pride, together with a contempt and neglect of the native country; in &s;hort, all the &s;o|cial qualities in &s;triking contra&s;t, and oppo&s;ition to each other.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="121">Tho&s;e parts of Suabia which belong to the greater potentates, &s;uch as Wirtemberg, Au&s;tria and Baden, are certainly the mo&s;t improved. The whole of Sua|bia may comprehend about 900 German &s;quare miles, and two millions of people. More than half of the&s;e are &s;ubjects of the three above-mentioned hou&s;es, though they do not own, by a great deal, one half of the land.</P>
<P>If the &s;mall German lords would keep them&s;elves within due bounds; if they were not de&s;irous to ap|pear greater than they really are; if they were more affectionate to their &s;ubjects; if they were not in&s;en|&s;ible to the &s;ofter feelings of humanity; and &s;o ho&s;|tile to the Mu&s;es and the Graces, the very &s;mallne&s;s of the&s;e &s;tates, would e&s;&s;entially contribute to their happine&s;s. For although a &s;mall country mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily part with &s;ome money, to procure what it wants from abroad, yet if the governor does not require many luxuries, a prudent economy and management will keep them within due bounds. Be&s;ides, as mo&s;t of the &s;overeigns in this part of the world are Catho|lic, and the rich foundations in the neighbourhood lies open to their younger children, they are not in|cumbered with the burthen of making any other pro|vi&s;ion for them. Many of them al&s;o belong to the church, and their preferments in that line, might pre|vent their laying any burthens on their &s;ubjects. But the happine&s;s of their people, is never their &s;tudy,
<PB N="117" REF="122">
from the want of family ties, they con&s;ider them|&s;elves as unconnected with the country, and think their only bu&s;ine&s;s is, to act like generals in an enemy's land, and plunder where they can. Were this not the ca&s;e, their exemption from &s;upporting any military e&s;tabli&s;hments, the ea&s;e with which a &s;mall country may be governed, the di&s;tance from the political di&s;|tractions of greater &s;tates, the &s;ecurity that other powers of Germany cannot play the great conqueror over them, and many other circum&s;tances, might be improved into ble&s;&s;ings in the&s;e &s;mall &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>The courts of Stutgard and Carl&s;rube are the only ones which &s;eem to have any &s;en&s;e of making the &s;ubject happy. The re&s;t appear vain enough to &s;up|po&s;e the people created for them, and not they for the people. The trea&s;urers of the&s;e petty lords, with &s;ome of whom, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> I was well acquainted, make a very e&s;&s;ential difference between the intere&s;ts of the prince, and tho&s;e of the people; and though the &s;ubject is under no apprehen&s;ion of gro&s;s tyranny; yet he is by no means &s;afe from having his pocket picked by the nicer operations of the finance.</P>
<P>The education of the&s;e lords, is &s;o thoroughly neg|lected, as hardly to admit better hopes. It is almo&s;t univer&s;ally in the hands of prie&s;ts. Part of the&s;e are monks, who&s;e knowledge is in a manner wrapped up in their cowls, and part are young <HI>abb&eacute;s</HI> ju&s;t come
<PB N="118" REF="123">
from &s;chool, and who only &s;eek to make their fortune, by the connections of their pupils. The monk teaches that a reverence to &s;aint <HI>Francis, Benedict,</HI> or <HI>Ignatius,</HI> a regular attendance on ma&s;s, telling beads, and giv|ing alms to mona&s;teries, are objects which will make amends for many tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of another kind.</P>
<P>My excur&s;ions, he adds, in the different &s;tates of the circle of Suabia, have not produced the rich en|tertainment I promi&s;ed my&s;elf. I vi&s;ited a dozen, free Imperial towns, in which, notwith&s;tanding the re|publican form of government, not a &s;park of liberty or patrioti&s;m was to be &s;een. The inhabitants have, through the oppre&s;&s;ion of more powerful neighbours, long &s;ince, lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of the value of independence; but though a&s;hamed to mention the name of their native country out of their own walls, within them they mimick the forms of old Rome, and after the manner of tho&s;e governors of the world, in&s;cribe their public buildings of &s;tate with <HI>Senatus, Populu&s;que, Hallen&s;is, Bop&s;ingen&s;is, Nordlingen&s;is,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the fifteenth century, the Imperial cities of Sua|bia, acted a very different part. They were then united in league, not only with each other, but with the cities of Franconia and the Rhine. Even the emperor had cau&s;e &s;ometimes to be alarmed at their increa&s;ing power, which made <HI>Charles</HI> V. di&s;unite them. From the time of the a&s;&s;ociation of the
<PB N="119" REF="124">
Han&s;e-towns, the gold flowed from all the coun|try into the cities. The&s;e were the exclu&s;ive &s;eats of indu&s;try, and their wealth drew into their dependance the neighbouring princes, who, at that time, lived by robberies. If the &s;pirit of trade, which then pre|vailed, had &s;uffered them to place more value on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of landed property, they would to this day have pre&s;erved &s;omewhat of their former &s;plendour; as with their power they might have made many con|que&s;ts, and with their wealth, many purcha&s;es.</P>
<P>All hopes are now vani&s;hed of their ever again be|coming con&s;picuous. As &s;oon as the prince, di&s;covered the value of indu&s;try, and gave it free encourage|ment in their dominions, it fled into their protection, and abandoned the dark walls of cities, in which a &s;y&s;tem of monopolies, little policy, and narrow|minded envy of the &s;ucce&s;sful, laid it under &s;uch ma|nifold re&s;traints. The con&s;equence of which is, the towns are &s;o reduced, as to be obliged to &s;ell the lit|tle landed property they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, to di&s;charge their debts. This has lately been the ca&s;e with Ulm; the large&s;t town in Suabia next to Aug&s;burg.</P>
<P>The great population which prevails in the circle is wonderful, when the untoward circum&s;tances of the country are con&s;idered. By untoward circum&s;tances; is meant the extortion of petty ma&s;ters, who all keep their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, their &s;tag-hounds, their French-cooks,
<PB N="120" REF="125">
and Engli&s;h hor&s;es; the perpetual quarrels among neighbours, which ari&s;e from the various peo|ple and governments of the empire; the &s;mall pro|fits attendant on indu&s;try, within &s;uch a confined &s;pot; and la&s;tly, the con&s;tant decrea&s;e of coin, owing to the &s;ums of money expended by the governors of the country, in &s;earch of foreign luxuries.</P>
<P>There is, however, an integrity &s;till adherent to the German character, and a kind of jovial humour about it, that makes the princes of the country &s;hud|der at any acts of wanton oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty, which, with the &s;ame powers, would no doubt be ex|erci&s;ed in Spain, Italy, and even in France. Give a German prince, but room for his dogs and hor&s;es, (for about the welfare of the&s;e, he is uncommonly &s;o|licitous) and you have little to fear from him in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>There is one object, however, in which there is great need of reformation, that is, in the admi|ni&s;tration of criminal ju&s;tice. The torture is not yet aboli&s;hed in the&s;e countries, and they &s;till behead, hang, break upon the wheel and impale. It is not very long &s;ince they burned a woman for being a witch. The civil law too, is not yet reduced to that perfect &s;tate which might be de&s;irable. Not that all forms &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, and every thing left to the wi&s;dom of the judge, under the pretence that forms

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the CIRCLE of WESTPHALIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS circle is &s;urrounded by the United Pro|vinces, the Northern or German &s;ea, the Up|per, and the Electoral Rheni&s;h circles, and the circle of Burgundy. Its extent amounts to 1250 &s;quare Ger|man miles. The air towards the north is cold, and the &s;oil almo&s;t one continued mora&s;s or barren &s;and. The hor&s;es are large, and the hogs in high e&s;teem, e&s;|pecially the hams, known by the name of We&s;tpha|lia hams. The &s;outhern part has a warmer atmo&s;|phere, and a much better &s;oil, which produces pa&s;|tures and &s;ome corn.</P>
<P>The principal rivers are the We&s;er, the Ems, the Lippe, and the Roer. It contains &s;everal &s;overeign|ties,
<PB N="122" REF="128">
as the bi&s;hoprics of O&s;naburg, Mun&s;ter, Pader|born and Liege; the abbeys of Corvey, Stablo, &amp;c. the duchy of Cleve, with the county of Mark, the duchies of Juliers and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, Na&s;&s;au-&s;iegan, and Na&s;|&s;au Dillenburg; the principalities of Ea&s;t Frie&s;land, and Mors, with &s;everal counties, &s;eignories, and the Imperial cities of Cologne, Aix-la Chapelle and Dort|mund. It has no capital, but Mun&s;ter is its mo&s;t con&s;iderable town. This circle reaches in length from north to &s;outh, about two hundred miles, and nearly the &s;ame di&s;tance from ea&s;t to we&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ummoning princes, and directors of the cir|cle, are the bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter, and with him alternately the electors of Brandenburgh and Palatine, as dukes of Cleve and Juliers, both of whom, in this directory, enjoy together but one voice. The diets of the cir|cle are u&s;ually appointed at Cologne, but ever &s;ince the year 1718, none have been held. The archives belonging to it, are kept at Du&s;&s;eldorf.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to religion, this circle is one of the mixed.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of PADERBORN,</HEAD>
<P>Is bounded by the country of Lippe towards the north; by the duchy of Brun&s;wick on the ea&s;t; by the county of Waldeck on the &s;outh, and by the duchy of
<PB N="123" REF="129">
We&s;tphalia on the we&s;t. Its greate&s;t extent from we&s;t to ea&s;t, amounts to eleven, and from north to &s;outh, to about nine German miles. It contains twenty ca&s;|tles, &s;ixteen mona&s;teries, and ninety-five pari&s;h churches. The Roman-catholic is the e&s;tabli&s;hed re|ligion. This country is remarkable for the variety of its &s;alt-&s;prings and other fountains. In the Tran&s;ac|tions of the Royal Society, December 1665, mention is made of a &s;pring in this country which lo&s;es it&s;elf twice in twenty-four hours, and returns with a great noi&s;e, and force &s;ufficient to turn three mills not far from its &s;ource; the inhabitants call it Bolder-born, or the Boi&s;trous &s;pring. And in the Tran&s;actions of January following, there is an account of another re|markable fountain in this dioce&s;e, called Metborn, which is a treble &s;pring, two &s;prings of which, though not a foot and a half di&s;tant from each other, have very different qualities; the one being limpid, blew|i&s;h, and luke-warm; the other cold as ice, turbid and whiti&s;h; of which water, all fowls that drink, die &s;oon after in &s;trong convul&s;ions; but giving them a lit|tle common &s;alt, will keep them alive longer, and vi|negar will quite recover them. The third &s;pring, which i&s;&s;ues about twenty paces from the others, is of a greeni&s;h colour, very clear, ta&s;tes both &s;our and &s;weet, but very plea&s;ant; and from its weight &s;uppo&s;ed to be a mixture of the other two.</P>
<P>It is probable, that it is the water from this &s;pring,
<PB N="124" REF="130">
which is &s;erved up at the tables of the principal <HI>Au|berges</HI> in Paderborn; and perhaps all Germany does not produce a lighter, or more plea&s;ant water to drink. It mo&s;tly re&s;embles the Seltzer, but is even lighter and more plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te. But to tho&s;e who drink freely of it, though with ever &s;o &s;mall a portion of wine, it is apt to occa&s;ion a &s;light fever on the brain; which however goes off &s;oon, if the quan|tity of water drank has not been immoderate. This water, like &s;ome of the delicate wines in the &s;outh of France and in Italy, lo&s;es all its fine qualities, and be|comes in&s;ipid, if tran&s;ported to any di&s;tance. If like the Seltzer water it would bear carriage, the revenue it would produce, mu&s;t be immen&s;e.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hopric of Paderborn was founded by <HI>Charle|magne,</HI> and the cathedral church con&s;ecrated by Pope <HI>Leo</HI> III. in 796.</P>
<P>Paderborn, the capital city, takes its name from the head of the river Pada, which &s;prings in a torrent near the cathedral of this city, and afterwards runs into the Lippe. At this fountain, according to the Magdeburg chronicle, mo&s;t of the inhabitants of Saxony and We&s;tphalia were baptized, about the year 780, by or|der of <HI>Charlemagne,</HI> the natives being heathens before he conquered this country. A great part of the ad|jacent country is very barren, and has little to boa&s;t of be&s;ides hogs-fle&s;h, deer, and other veni&s;on; in the
<PB N="125" REF="131">
middle of it, however, are high mountains which con|tain iron mines.</P>
<P>The town formerly enjoyed the immunities of a city of the empire, and carried on a great trade, but at pre&s;ent its commerce is incon&s;iderable, and the in|habitants &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by agriculture, and breeding of cattle. The emperor <HI>Charlemagne,</HI> and &s;everal other emperors and German kings re&s;ided and held their diets here formerly.</P>

<HEAD>The BISPHOPRIC of MUNSTER,</HEAD>
<P>Is bounded on the ea&s;t by the bi&s;hopric of O&s;naburg and Paderborn; on the &s;outh by the county of Mark; on the we&s;t by the duchy of Cleve and Zutphen, and on the north by the counties of Bentheim and Stein|furth. It is the large&s;t of all the We&s;tphalian bi&s;hop|rics, being an hundred miles in length, and eighty in breadth.</P>
<P>This country is generally level. It has, however, &s;ome agreeable heights, but no great or lofty moun|tains. The exten&s;ive heaths which are &s;een in it, &s;erve for breeding of cattle. There are al&s;o &s;ome fruitful plains, large woods, and turf, together with good quarries of &s;tone, and rivers abounding in fi&s;h. No part of We&s;tphalia produces better bacon, which
<PB N="126" REF="132">
is exported all over Europe, and &s;o much admired, that it produces double the price of any other.</P>
<P>At the time of the reformation, the Lutheran doc|trine found many adherents in this part of the world, but it was afterwards &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. There are &s;everal nobles here who are &s;till of the prote&s;tant per&s;ua&s;ion, but the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of the country is catho|lic.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop is a prince of the empire, and at the di|et ranks with the bi&s;hop of Liege, but in &s;uch a man|ner, that the bi&s;hop of O&s;naburg, always &s;its between both. In the circle of We&s;tphalia, he is the fir&s;t &s;um|moning prince and director of the circle. The chap|ter con&s;i&s;ts of forty members, who are all nobles, and mu&s;t prove their nobility; and once a year the &s;hield and helm of the younge&s;t canon are carried in proce&s;|&s;ion, with beat of drum through the city, that every one may enquire into his pedigree.</P>
<P>Mun&s;ter, the capital of the bi&s;hopric, lies in a very fruitful and plea&s;ant &s;pot, on the rivulet Aa, or Al|pha. The city is large, rich, and populous. It is de|fended by a &s;trong citadel, built to keep the inhabitants in awe, after the in&s;urrection made by John of Leyden, in 1635, who, pretending divine in&s;pira|tion, drove the bi&s;hop and magi&s;trates out of the city,
<PB N="127" REF="133">
cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be proclaimed king, and held out a fourteen months &s;iege again&s;t them. He made one of his concubines queen, but afterwards cut off her head, becau&s;e &s;he would not approve of all his mad projects. The bi&s;hop having got a reinforcement of troops, at la&s;t &s;eized the city by &s;tratagem, and took the anabapti&s;t king pri&s;oner, who having been car|ried in deri&s;ion to mo&s;t of the countries in Germany, was the year following put to death with red-hot pin|cers, and his bones hung up in an iron-cage, on the top of a &s;teeple.</P>
<P>At Mun&s;ter, in 1648, was concluded the treaty which e&s;tabli&s;hed the prote&s;tant religion, and put an end to the thirty years war. This treaty has been made the ba&s;is of almo&s;t every &s;ub&s;equent treaty, e&s;|pecially as to religion. It is &s;ometimes called the treaty of We&s;tphalia, at others, the treaty of O&s;na|burg, becau&s;e the prote&s;tant princes held their confer|rences at O&s;naburg, as the catholic princes did theirs at Mun&s;ter. The Swedes had been engaged eighteen years in this war, and got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an hundred &s;trong towns in the empire; and by this treaty they &s;ecured the duchies of Bremen and Verden, we&s;tern Pomerania, the i&s;land of Rugen, and the city of Wei&s;|mer, and might have made &s;till better terms, if they had not adhered to the part of the prote&s;tants.</P>

<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of LIEGE,</HEAD>
<P>Lies in the Netherlands, and is bounded on the north by Brabant and Guelderland: on the ea&s;t by the du|chies of Limburg and Juliers; on the &s;outh by Lux|emburgh and the Ardennes, and on the we&s;t by Bra|bant and the country of Namur. It is in length from north to &s;outh, about twenty German miles, and about half as much in breadth, but the breadth varies, be|ing twice as much in &s;ome places as it is in others. Some &s;mall di&s;tricts lie within the juri&s;diction of the duchies of Brabant and Luxemburg.</P>
<P>The &s;oil is fertile in corn and pa&s;turage, and yields wine, which re&s;embles the middling wines of Burgun|dy and Champagne, together with very con&s;iderable fore&s;ts and mines of copper, lead, iron, and &s;tone|coal; as al&s;o many good &s;tone-quarries, and among them, likewi&s;e &s;ome marble. This bi&s;hopric is al&s;o celebrated for its mineral-waters; namely, tho&s;e of Spa, and Chaude-fontaine.</P>
<P>The principal rivers by which it is watered, are the Meu&s;e and Sambre, which unite in the county of Na|mur.</P>
<P>The chief exports of this country, and particularly of the town of Liege, con&s;i&s;t of beer, fire-arms, nails, &s;erge, leather and &s;tone-coal; all which are ex|ported
<PB N="129" REF="135">
from hence in prodigious large quantities, more particularly fire-arms, &s;uch as guns, pi&s;tols, and &s;words, with which in time of war they &s;erve almo&s;t all Europe. The low prices for which they will &s;ell their guns and &s;words, is almo&s;t incredible. No na|tion can come in incompetition with them, in point of cheapne&s;s for the&s;e articles.</P>
<P>In the circle of We&s;tphalia, this Bi&s;hop is third in rank. He is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal princes in Germany. His annual revenue is about three hundred thou&s;and ducats. The chapter of Liege con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixty major-canons, who are mo&s;t of them of noble extraction, and have the power of electing their bi&s;hop. There are twenty-four other canons, who have no &s;hare in this election. It is computed there are in this dioce&s;e, or rather principality, fifty-two baronies, eighteen walled towns, and four hun|dred villages well peopled. The Bi&s;hop can lay no taxes on his &s;ubjects without the con&s;ent of the clergy, nobility, and commons, who are called the three &s;tates of the country.</P>
<P>Liege is &s;uppo&s;ed to derive its name from a little rivulet, which runs through this country, and falls into the Meu&s;e. It is a very large, and a very popu|lous city, of a triangular form. There are &s;everal hills and vallies within the walls, and &s;ome i&s;lands made by the Meu&s;e, which is here divided into three
<PB N="130" REF="136">
branches, which, after having pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;treets under &s;everal bridges, unite again a little be|low the town. The town is &s;eated in a vale between two mountains, the highe&s;t of which lies to the north, and the other to the ea&s;t. In the valley between the&s;e mountains runs the river Meu&s;e, and it is here very broad.</P>
<P>This town has ten large &s;uburbs, in which are a great number of religious hou&s;es and churches; which la&s;t, with tho&s;e in the city, make an hundred in all. In the city and &s;uburbs are likewi&s;e &s;everal public places or &s;quares, as al&s;o, a cathedral church dedicat|ed to St. Lambert, in which there are many reliques. The Bi&s;hop's palace and the cathedral, are large and &s;pacious buildings, the latter is built with red &s;tone, and has a quadrangle within. This city is about four miles in circumference, and contains about an hun|dred and fifty &s;treets. According to the opinion of &s;ome travellers, no city in Germany or France, can equal it in fine churches, convents, and other religi|ous foundations. The fortifications of the city are but mean, and being commanded by hills which &s;urround them, are incapable of re&s;i&s;ting a large army; but the citadel, which is &s;ituated on a very high hill, is a place of &s;ome &s;trength; yet it may be a que&s;tion, whether it is not of more di&s;&s;ervice than real &s;ervice; as it is by no means &s;trong, and from its elevated &s;ituation, if the enemy once got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, they could de|moli&s;h
<PB N="131" REF="137">
the town in a few hours. The duke of Marlborough took this city in the year 1702.</P>
<P>Liege is &s;tiled an Imperial city, under the protec|tion of its Bi&s;hop; but this prelate is &s;overeign of the city and dioce&s;e, and the citizens have &s;uffered more than once very &s;everely for di&s;puting his autho|rity. Mo&s;t of the &s;treets are very narrow, but there are many of a good breadth. There are al&s;o &s;ome very &s;pacious and hand&s;ome private edifices; but in general, the buildings are mean and &s;habby. On the banks of the river there are &s;ome very plea&s;ant walks, which are much re&s;orted to in &s;ummer. The envi|rons are &s;o extremely plea&s;ant, that it has obtained the name of the paradi&s;e of eccle&s;ia&s;tics. It is a com|mon &s;aying, likewi&s;e, that it is the hell of women, becau&s;e they are obliged to live a very laborious life, the women doing all the laborious offices both at home and abroad; the purgatory of men, becau&s;e they are almo&s;t all governed by their wives; and the paradi&s;e of monks, on account of their rich benefices. The Engli&s;h je&s;uits have a college here, delight|fully &s;ituated on the &s;ummit of a high hill, with a very fine garden. This college is now appro|priated to the education of youth in the catholic per|&s;ua&s;ion; of which there are in general from &s;ixty to &s;eventy &s;cholars, mo&s;tly the &s;ons of our nobility and gentry. It is wonderfully well fitted up for the pur|po&s;e, and the di&s;cipline and care that is taken of the
<PB N="132" REF="138">
young gentlemen, is equalled in no place. Great pains are taken with their education. There is &s;carce an art, &s;cience, or language, which is not taught in this &s;eminary. The proficiency in cla&s;&s;ical learning therefore cannot be expected to be very great. In &s;hort, the method of &s;tudy generally pur&s;ued in this college, re&s;embles the plans of our mo&s;t con&s;iderable modern academies in the vicinity of the metropolis, which are certainly very different from the mode of education in our great &s;chools, &s;uch as We&s;tmin&s;ter, Eton, Winche&s;ter, and one or two more.</P>
<P>At the oppo&s;ite extremity of the city, is a convent of Engli&s;h nuns, who&s;e chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is obtained by the education of young ladies, of their own re|ligious per&s;ua&s;ion. They have generally the &s;ame number of young per&s;ons under their tuition, with the college of Engli&s;h je&s;uits, who are likewi&s;e chiefly the daughters of our catholic nobility and gentry. The pen&s;ion as it is called, or the terms for board and education, are very moderate, about 25l. a year, every thing included, and are kept in &s;ickne&s;s and in health, they al&s;o profe&s;s to teach a multiplicity of things. The nuns, as well as the je&s;uits, are almo&s;t all, either from this country or from Ireland, and many of them related to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable catholic families in one or other of them.</P>
<P>In the convent, there is likewi&s;e a pen&s;ion for &s;uch
<PB N="133" REF="139">
ladies as chu&s;e to come and board there. This pen|&s;ion is kept in a building adjoining to the convent, but not within the inner walls of the convent. It is upon a very frugal plan; the pen&s;ion is very rea&s;on|able, the dinners &s;umptuous, they all dine in one eat|ing-room, and have &s;eparate chambers to retire to, for tea and to &s;it in. The only inconvenience is, that being within the outer gate of the convent, they are obliged to di&s;mi&s;s their friends, and return home them&s;elves by nine in the evening. In other re&s;pects, this is a very agreeable and cheap place for tho&s;e per|&s;ons to come to, who wi&s;h to live comfortably and agreeably on a &s;lender income. It may not be ami&s;s to remark, that &s;eparate dinners are not allowed, ex|cept in illne&s;s,</P>
<P>In the mona&s;tery of St. William, ju&s;t without the walls, lie the remains of that famous Engli&s;h travel|ler, Sir <HI>John Mandeville,</HI> who having vi&s;ited almo&s;t all the great cities of Europe, preferred Liege to any of them, and accordingly pa&s;&s;ed the latter part of his days in this city. The univer&s;ity was &s;o con&s;iderable, that <HI>Meibonus</HI> relates, there were twenty-one kings &s;ons re&s;ident here in 1131. At pre&s;ent it is in no e&s;|teem. There is al&s;o a public library in this city, be|longing to the council-hou&s;e, but it is by no means con&s;iderable, and is not frequented. The environs of this city are highly picture&s;que and beautiful, but the internal parts carry a very dingy hue, owing to the
<PB N="134" REF="140">
clouds of &s;moke continually i&s;&s;uing from &s;uch an im|men&s;e number of little forges, as are to be found in its precincts.</P>
<P>About three Engli&s;h miles from Liege, at the ex|tremity of a beautiful valley, and on the banks of a very plea&s;ing &s;tream, which de&s;cends with con&s;ider|able rapidity from the mountains, &s;tands the little village of Chau de-fontaine. This village is famous for its baths, the waters of which are of a &s;ulphurous nature, and always hot. The inn where the baths are, is not much frequented. The hou&s;e is very old fa&s;hioned, but the accommodations, as to the wines and diet, are far from bad, and the charges not extra|vagant. There are many families who make this hou&s;e their re&s;idence for weeks together, tempted to it &s;ole|ly from the retiredne&s;s of the &s;ituation, the beauty of the &s;cenery, and the occa&s;ional luxury of the baths, which are made u&s;e of more for plea&s;ure than health. They are of a very agreeable temperature as to heat; and the expences attending the care of them, very in|con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Near Liege, in the road, however, from Spa to Aix-la-Chapelle, &s;tands the town of Verviers; a place for|merly of not near &s;o much import as at pre&s;ent. This town owes all its con&s;equence to its woollen manu|factures, which are now carried on to very great ex|tent; and of late years, they have even rivalled us
<PB N="135" REF="141">
very &s;ucce&s;sfully, in &s;everal of the northern parts of Europe, in this branch of commerce.</P>
<P>About &s;eventeen miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Liege, is the village of Spa, which has been long famous all over Eu|rope for its mineral waters. It is &s;eated in a &s;paci|cious valley &s;urrounded by hills, part of which are covered with woods, and on the north-&s;ide, more par|ticularly, with very &s;teep and craggy mountains, which immediately overlook the town.</P>
<P>The town of Spa, according to <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> is &s;ituated in a &s;tony, mountainous country, on the banks of which, in &s;ummer, is a murmuring &s;tream, but which in winter, is &s;ometimes a rapid river; the air is good, and the environs in general are plea&s;ant, though rude and uncultivated, having much the appearance of a part of the globe, which has been broken up by earthquakes, or &s;ome violent convul&s;ions of nature; &s;o that all the luxuries of life are brought daily on wo|men's backs from Liege. In the winter, the place is de&s;erted.</P>
<P>The account given by <HI>Pliny</HI> of the waters of this place, is that they ta&s;ted of iron, were purgative, and a &s;overeign cure for tertian agues and the &s;tone. The three principal &s;prings are the Pouhon, the Geron|&s;tere, and the Savoniere. The Pouhon is in the mid|dle of the town, or rather village; for Spa, &s;trictly
<PB N="136" REF="142">
&s;peaking, is no more than a village, though, from the numerous and &s;plendid buildings erected within the&s;e few years, for the accommodation of &s;trangers, many of which are of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction; it is more con|&s;iderable than many towns. It is from this &s;pring that mo&s;t of the water is &s;upplied, which is &s;ent into foreign countries. Over the &s;pring is a &s;tone build|ing, on which there is an in&s;cription recounting the virtues of the&s;e waters; that they remove ob&s;truc|tions, di&s;&s;olve hard &s;wellings, dry up a &s;uperfluity of moi&s;ture, and &s;trengthen weak limbs, if drank in pro|per quantities, and under the direction of the faculty.</P>
<P>Health is now become but a &s;econdary object that attracts &s;uch a &s;plendid a&s;&s;embly of both &s;exes, which now re&s;ort to this delightful &s;pot. Numbers re&s;ort here for the &s;ake of gaming high, and by their dex|terity and addre&s;s, bid fair to amend or improve their &s;hattered fortunes: a crowd of another &s;ort at|tend only as para&s;ites, and dependant on &s;uch illu&s;|trious per&s;onages as keep public tables, and make a &s;plendid appearance. Others come there to make the be&s;t market they can of the commodities they im|port. Some aim at procuring new acquaintance and corre&s;pondents. Others re&s;ort here purely to enjoy them&s;elves and the whole&s;ome air of the climate. Some again have diver&s;ion and amu&s;ement principally in view, and &s;pend their time here more for the &s;ake of the good and grand company that comes here, than
<PB N="137" REF="143">
out of any regard to the virtue of the waters. In a word, this mo&s;t delightful &s;pot is the centre and &s;eat of all joy and plea&s;ure; which contribute towards the countle&s;s miracles that are wrought here beyond the power of words to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>He who takes into his con&s;ideration, only the num|berle&s;s amu&s;ements of this delicious &s;pot, the various games, the balls, the plays, the walks, and other en|tertainments that are carried on here, and &s;ucceed each other without intermi&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t doubtle&s;s imagine, that a life &s;o led in the daily gratification of every &s;cene, is able to remove a variety of little inconve|niences, without the lea&s;t aid or a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the&s;e &s;alutary &s;prings. Such, for in&s;tance, as the yellow jaundice, which is principally owing to &s;ome light and trivial ob&s;truction, the hyp or vapours, which are of|ten the re&s;ult only of an unpolite deportment, from a too peevi&s;h and moro&s;e hu&s;band, and more particu|larly, that petty di&s;order called the green-&s;ickne&s;s, a maiden-di&s;temper for the immediate cure of which, the young lover is the infallible phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>There are three different ways of lodging, as well as living, at Spa.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e per&s;ons who come there alone, or in &s;mall parties, with a &s;lender retinue, and little baggage, lodge in general at public inns.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="144">In all the&s;e there is attendance &s;ufficient, and a more plentiful larder than is rea&s;onably requi&s;ite; con|&s;idering that their tables or ordinaries are principally intended for the reception of &s;uch per&s;ons as are &s;up|po&s;e to frequent the&s;e hou&s;es, for the recovery of their health.</P>
<P>The &s;econd method of living at Spa, is by hiring furni&s;hed hou&s;es, as in Bath or London. Of this &s;ort there are abundance to be met with, of all &s;izes and prices Princes, and per&s;ons of high rank, who pro|po&s;e keeping a public table there, generally adopt this mode.</P>
<P>The third method is to hire furni&s;hed apartments. And this is more calculated for &s;mall families, or &s;in|gle per&s;ons, who do not like the hurry and bu&s;tle of an inn. The&s;e per&s;ons generally &s;end for their provi|&s;ions from the adjacent inn, at &s;o much per head. Or if &s;ingle gentlemen, they will find it much the cheape&s;t method to dine at the public ordinaries, where they will meet with very good company, pick up fre&s;h acquaintance, and indulge them&s;elves in a variety of different conver&s;ations.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of paying vi&s;its, except among per&s;ons of &s;ome rank, is now almo&s;t wholly laid a&s;ide. The e&s;tabli&s;hed etiquette, however, is that the inferior pays the fir&s;t vi&s;it, whether he arrives fir&s;t or la&s;t, and
<PB N="139" REF="145">
the return is conducted according to the rank and character they re&s;pectively bear. If the di&s;proportion is very great, no return at all is expected. Princes, however, generally te&s;tify their regard for any per&s;on of di&s;tinction by a per&s;onal vi&s;it. The counter-vi&s;its are, in general, little more than bare ceremony; they are reduced to a formal tour in a chariot, or perhaps on foot, to leave a card at &s;ome per&s;on's hou&s;e, who never fails to be out of the way, or, at lea&s;t, denied.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t people, however, pay no vi&s;its at all, but to &s;uch per&s;ons as are manife&s;tly their &s;uperiors: they content them&s;elves with te&s;tifying their re&s;pects to their bottle-companions, or &s;uch others as they are per&s;onally acquainted with, who on the other hand frequently circumvent them, by waiting on them fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who delight in tranquility and repo&s;e, may re&s;ide there in as retired and &s;olitary a manner as they plea&s;e, and there are rural objects enough to en|gage their attention.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the multitude of per&s;ons of both &s;exes, who re&s;ort to the Spa, there are a variety of charac|ters, and among them many very amiable ones; and be&s;ides the friends u&s;ually to be met with there, it is impo&s;&s;ible to fail of finding &s;ome &s;trangers, who&s;e com|pany and conver&s;ation prove exceedingly engaging: the&s;e ties of friend&s;hip, thus &s;uddenly contracted, and
<PB N="140" REF="146">
grounded on a &s;ympathy of tempers and conformity of characters, e&s;tabli&s;h an openne&s;s of heart, which is the life and &s;oul of &s;ociety, and renders it inexpre&s;&s;ibly delightful.</P>
<P>Time, at the Spa, flies away with an amazing &s;wift|ne&s;s; though it mu&s;t be allowed, two parts in three of it, are &s;pent in nothing but amu&s;ements; yet the whole body of its vi&s;itors is in perpetual motion, all &s;eemingly, at lea&s;t, as bu&s;y as bees; and not a drone to be met with in the whole hive. The amu&s;ements follow &s;o clo&s;e at the heels of each other, in that mo&s;t agreeable rece&s;s, that there are &s;ome people who have been there for &s;ix weeks &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and &s;ometimes longer, who have never dreamt of taking any &s;urvey of the country, or in &s;hort, any of the parts ad|jacent.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on for re&s;orting to the Spa, does not pro|perly commence till the end of June, but ap|pears in its utmo&s;t beauty and perfection about the latter end of July, and the whole month of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the company are at the Pouhon well, by five o'clock in the morning, which gives the town the appearance of a fair at that hour, it being then likewi&s;e crowded with a multiplicity of hor&s;es and carriages waiting to carry the company to the Ge|ron&s;tere and Savoniere &s;prings. This latter &s;pring
<PB N="141" REF="147">
is &s;ituated on an eminence, at the ea&s;t &s;ide of Spa, and is much about half a league from the town. The road, however, is rugged, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure trou|ble&s;ome and unplea&s;ant, e&s;pecially in the going there, it being upon an a&s;cent all the way, in&s;omuch that though the di&s;tance is &s;o incon&s;iderable, mo&s;t of its vi&s;itors go there in carriages or on hor&s;eback, le&s;t the walk &s;hould be apt to throw them into too great a per&s;piration, or put them out of breath; in either of which ca&s;es, as the water is very cold, it might prove of dangerous con&s;equence, as is well known by too fatal experience.</P>
<P>This &s;pring, or well, is contained in a very &s;mall ba&s;on, round which the drinkers &s;tand, in order to be &s;erved; and is covered with a dome or cupola, com|po&s;ed of free-&s;tone, and the whole &s;urrounded with a low wall.</P>
<P>At one of the &s;prings there is a large building, with a fire in it when the mornings are chilly, to which the company retire, after having drank a gla&s;s or two of the waters. Here you meet with a mixed con|cour&s;e of people of all ranks and degrees, citizens, monks, nuns, lords and ladies, and &s;ometimes kings or princes, who dive&s;ting them&s;elves of their high dig|nity, conver&s;e there with the &s;ame familiarity, as if they were all upon a level.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="148">There are hor&s;es and carriages to be let here, ei|ther for the morning only, or for the whole day. The price of the hor&s;e, to go to either of the di&s;tant wells, is about two &s;chellings, each &s;chelling &s;even|pence Engli&s;h. Tho&s;e who engage them for the whole day, in order to enjoy the plea&s;ure of an evening's ride, pay about three &s;chellings. In the very height of the &s;ea&s;on, probably &s;omething more. The carriages let out for hire, which are low phaetons, very &s;habby, old fa&s;hioned and clum&s;y, are cheap in proportion.</P>
<P>With regard to the general expences attending a re&s;idence at Spa, they are not, even in the height of the &s;ea&s;on, more than tho&s;e of the little watering-place on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of England, according to the &s;tile in which a per&s;on lives. The wines and diet, on the other hand, are much more &s;umptuous than they are to be met with in England on almo&s;t any terms. There are likewi&s;e &s;everal circulating libra|ries in this place, tolerably well &s;tocked, not only with novels, but with all modern publications, even of works of literature.</P>
<P>This frequently induces &s;trangers to make con&s;i|derable purcha&s;es from the&s;e libraries. And French books may be met with here on as rea&s;onable terms, as in any town of Europe, and in as great variety in point of a&s;&s;ortment.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="149">As the latter part of the forenoon, in the month of July and Augu&s;t, is frequently too &s;ultry to ride out in the morning, it is generally filled up between the&s;e libraries, and the a&s;&s;embly rooms, where the pharo-bank is held, and to which all &s;trangers are admitted gratis. The principal a&s;&s;embly room is &s;eated on an eminence, about half a mile from the town, command|ing a mo&s;t delightful view. It is called the Vauxhall. Here a great number of parties and &s;ingle gentlemen breakfa&s;t on their return from the wells, a band of mu&s;ic playing the whole time. When this repa&s;t is over, the pharo-bank opens, and continues dealing for about a couple of hours. The capital &s;tock is about a 1000 louis d'ors. No per&s;on is allowed to punt le&s;s than a guinea, except the ladies, who are indulged with the liberty of playing for &s;ilver. A hazard table is then introduced for about half an hour, or a little more, ju&s;t before dinner, when the ladies, for the mo&s;t part retire, and this clo&s;es the morning's amu&s;e|ment in the public-rooms. There are card-tables for tho&s;e who chu&s;e to make parties of whi&s;t and piquet. The evening, till du&s;k, is generally dedicated to ex|cur&s;ions on hor&s;eback, or in carriages; the &s;quare be|ing full of carriages, and hor&s;es &s;tanding for hire about five o'clock every evening. There are al&s;o two or three very fine public walks, where the company meet as the &s;un gets nearer the horizon, and at which the band of mu&s;ic belonging to the rooms occa&s;ion|ally play. The mountains overhanging Spa, pre&s;ent
<PB N="144" REF="150">
a number of very agreeable walks, which have been cut through the woods at a great expence, in zig-zag paths, all up the &s;ides of them. The beautiful views that pre&s;ent them&s;elves in climbing up the&s;e moun|tains, the pro&s;pects of which vary every in&s;tant, am|ply recompence the toil. No &s;ooner does night clo&s;e in, but all the company repair in&s;tantly to the rooms. Of the&s;e there are two, both very elegant and &s;u|perb. The one in the town, and the other about half a mile di&s;tant, called the Vauxhall, as has been already ob&s;erved. At one or other of the&s;e rooms, there are balls, three or four times a week. The in|tervening nights, there are only card-parties, a pro|menade, and the pharo-bank. It is this latter which &s;eems to keep every thing alive in the&s;e regions of di&s;|&s;ipation. The large heaps of gold di&s;played on the cloth, which covers the pharo-table; the number of people of fa&s;hion who are playing at it; the at|tempts which are made by many of them to break the bank, by doubling the &s;takes from time to time, is &s;ufficient to intere&s;t the attention of a number of &s;pectators unconnected with the play. And it &s;ome|times happens, that a &s;pirited player is &s;ucce&s;sful enough to break it. A &s;ingular in&s;tance of which, I will relate, from <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e.</HI> Some years &s;ince, a &s;tranger, of plain but decent appearance, took his &s;eat at the pharo-table at Aix-la-chapelle; the bank was at that time rich, and the &s;tranger, after having lo&s;t &s;ome money, threw down his pocket-book, full of
<PB N="145" REF="151">
notes to a high amount, and declared he was <HI>at the whole bank.</HI> The &s;tranger won, the banker trembled, and the company &s;tared at the cool di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate man|ner in which the &s;tranger received his good fortune, who ordered a per&s;on, that &s;tood near him to take the money, and retired; but not before, a reduced half|pay captain, who had been looking on, exclaimed aloud, <Q>Good God! if I had won but a twentieth-part of that &s;um, what a happy man it would have made me!</Q>&mdash;Would it, &s;aid the &s;tranger? then you &s;hall be happy; and in a &s;hort time, a &s;ervant was &s;ent, who put into the officer's hands a pur&s;e, contain|ing the twentieth part of the money won. A few days afterwards, it was known, that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia had been <HI>incog.</HI> at Aix-la-chapelle, and that he was the &s;tranger, the gambler, and the generous donor.</P>
<P>The prince Bi&s;hop of Liege, is &s;uppo&s;ed to receive &s;everal thou&s;ands a year from the bankers belonging to this pharo-bank, for giving them his licence to hold it. At the end of the a&s;&s;embly-room in the town of Spa, is a very neat, little French theatre, where there are plays three times a week. The actors, in general, are toler|able. The parterre of this theatre, by being boarded over on ball-nights, &s;erves as an apartment for the pharo-bank. For per&s;ons of rank and fa&s;hion, there is a club, where the members dine together every day. It was in&s;tituted by the Engli&s;h. Every per|&s;on mu&s;t be balloted for, and one black-ball is &s;uffici|ent
<PB N="146" REF="152">
to exclude the candidate. Dre&s;s and &s;uppers are never thought of at Spa. Every one dre&s;&s;es a l'Angloi&s;e, and the heat of the weather, the early ri&s;ing, and late dinners, make people wholly un&s;olicitous about eating or retiring from the rooms.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to tho&s;e who come there only for the waters, there are divers ca&s;es where they do not agree with the con&s;titution of tho&s;e invalids who drink them; and it is certain, there will always be vi&s;itors who will never receive the lea&s;t benefit from them. Some drink them out of caprice, or el&s;e follow &s;uch in&s;tructions as are whim&s;ical and injudicious; &s;ome &s;wallow down too large a quantity; and others drink them too &s;paringly; &s;ometimes without any proper preparation, and &s;ometimes by altering the qualities of the waters, with an intermixture of drugs pre&s;cribed by phy&s;icians, unacquainted with the practice pecu|liar to the wells, or incapable of fore&s;eeing in what manner they will operate. In &s;hort, there are abun|dance of errors committed by invalids, either through the non-ob&s;ervance of a proper regimen, or the im|prudent choice of a &s;pring unfit for their &s;ervice, as well as a mi&s;take in the quantity or manner of drink|ing the waters, on which the cure of their particular di&s;order in a great mea&s;ure depends.</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally known, the Geron&s;tere &s;pring is mo&s;t &s;uitable in tho&s;e ca&s;es where there is a weakne&s;s
<PB N="147" REF="153">
of the fibres, or a contraction proceeding from a too lively or quick &s;en&s;ibility: it is fit likewi&s;e for weak &s;tomachs, and &s;uch as have tender con&s;titutions, who&s;e fibres are too inactive; &s;uch as are in a langui&s;hing condition, or are afflicted with catarrhs and other pec|toral di&s;orders.</P>
<P>The impetuous rains and violent hurricanes that frequently happen in this country, make the ground and &s;tones &s;hrink and give way &s;o, that the roads are almo&s;t impa&s;&s;ible in winter, except on the new chau&s;&s;&eacute; from Spa to Liege;&mdash;however, if the roads are &s;ome|what rough, the mountains through which tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages are cut, afford a very plea&s;ing pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The&s;e rough-hewn, unpoli&s;hed rocks, intermixt with a great variety of &s;tately oaks and humble &s;hrubs, &s;trike the eye of every curious traveller, who has any adequate idea of a beauteous land&s;cape. For my own part, &s;ays the author of a tour to Spa, the fir&s;t time I travelled that road, I ordered my coachman to halt at &s;everal places, that I might look about me, and make my ob&s;ervations on the agreeable pro&s;pects which the narrow pa&s;&s;ages cut through the mountains, pre&s;ented them&s;elves from time to time to my view. I was agreeably &s;urprized, &s;ays he, to find that an unculti|vated &s;pot of ground, with no other covering than a worthle&s;s, pitiful &s;tock of broom, or heath, &s;hould &s;o delightfully delude me, as to appear, a-far off, like a

<HEAD>The BISPOPRIC of OSNABERG,</HEAD>
<P>Is bounded on the north by Lower Mun&s;ter, on the &s;outh by Upper Mun&s;ter, on the ea&s;t by the principa|lity of Minden, and on the we&s;t, by Mun&s;ter and Lingen. It is about ten German miles in length, from north to &s;outh; and from ea&s;t to we&s;t, be|tween four and &s;ix German miles.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t bi&s;hopric founded by <HI>Charlemagne,</HI> who granted extraordinary privileges to this &s;ee, ex|empting it from all manner of &s;ervice and homage, even to the Emperor him&s;elf. At the peace of O&s;na|berg, in 1648, it was &s;ettled, that this bi&s;hopric &s;hould alternately have a Roman catholic and a Lutheran bi&s;hop, and that the chapter might chu&s;e and &s;elect the former, either from among them&s;elves or el&s;ewhere; but that the latter &s;hould always be a prince of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick, and of that branch of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick from which his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty is de|&s;cended. When they have a popi&s;h bi&s;hop, he is &s;uf|fragan
<PB N="149" REF="155">
to the archbi&s;hop of Cologne, but the prote&s;tant bi&s;hop, who at pre&s;ent is his maje&s;ty's &s;econd &s;on, his royal highne&s;s the duke of York, has no eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction over the catholics. The Bi&s;hop is a prince of the empire, and &s;its at the diets of the empire in the council of princes, between the bi&s;hops of Mun&s;ter and Liege. Among the &s;everal &s;tates of the circle of We&s;tphalia, this bi&s;hopric is fourth in rank, and his principality produces him yearly 180,000 Rheni&s;h flo|rins, which is 15,500l. a year; this, according to <HI>Rei&s;bec.</HI> But we have rea&s;on to believe, it produces twice the &s;um.</P>
<P>This country is partly Roman-catholic, and partly prote&s;tant,; neither the prote&s;tant nor the Roman-catholic bi&s;hops have the right of reformation; but every thing mu&s;t remain as it &s;tood in 1624. No Jews are tolerated in this country.</P>
<P>The cathedral is in the hands of the Roman-catho|lics; the chapter con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-five canons, not above four of which are prote&s;tant, and the&s;e have no vote in the election of a popi&s;h bi&s;hop. Some of the other churches are prote&s;tant. There are not above four towns in the whole country, and about 20,000 fire-places or hearths.</P>
<P>About one half of this bi&s;hopric con&s;i&s;ts of heath|lands, which yield above ten &s;orts of turf, as al&s;o pa&s;|turage.
<PB N="150" REF="156">
This country, likewi&s;e, produces as much rye as &s;upplies the inhabitants, and above five hun|dred &s;tills. Con&s;iderable quantities of corn are im|ported here from the principality of Minden. The breed of cattle, likewi&s;e, is but &s;mall, and they are mo&s;tly &s;upplied from Frizeland.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are diligent and laborious. The country people &s;eldom &s;it by &s;toves, as they do in other parts of Germany, but by fire-hearths, where they perform their principal work, which is &s;pinning. Above &s;ix thou&s;and of them go every year to Hol|land, where they now, till, cut turf, and do other work for hire. The meane&s;t of them, notwith&s;tanding, carry home twenty, and the be&s;t workmen full &s;eventy florins; &s;o that the ready money, which they by this means bring into the country, may be reckoned at 200,000 florins.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t and mo&s;t beneficial occupation of the inhabitants con&s;i&s;ts in &s;pinning yarn, and manufac|turing a coar&s;e kind of linen; which is conveyed by the Engli&s;h, Dutch, and Spaniards, to Guinea and America, and brings annually into the country above a million of rixdollars.</P>
<P>O&s;naberg, the capital, is &s;ituated in a fine plain, and beautified with &s;everal, noble, public buildings. It derives its name from a bridge over the river Haze.
<PB N="151" REF="157">
The manner of building here is antique, and the number of hou&s;es, exclu&s;ive of the public and bye-buildings, amounts to 1200. The town is not po|pulous, not above five hundred children being bap|tized in a year. Its magi&s;tracy is Lutheran, and re|cho&s;en annually. The Bi&s;hop's palace is fortified like a ca&s;tle. They are &s;aid to have the be&s;t bread and beer here, which is to be met with in We&s;tphalia, and they carry on a con&s;iderable traffic in linen, cloth, and hams. Its principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depends on its linen trade manufactured in the country, and in the foreign manufacturies, vended here in retail. There are three well-built ho&s;pitals here, exclu&s;ive of &s;ome &s;maller ones. This city was al&s;o formerly, one of the Han&s;e towns. The epi&s;copal palace belongs to the electoral hou&s;e of Luneburg, who u&s;ually re&s;igns it to the catholic bi&s;hop for his re&s;idence. This town is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the right of making copper, which it exerci&s;ed for the fir&s;t time in 1740. In the hall of the council-hou&s;e, where the celebrated peace of 1648 was concluded, are &s;een pictures of the amba&s;&s;adors who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at it.</P>
<P>The duchies of Oldenburg, and Delmenhurt&s;t, which the king of Denmark, at the de&s;ire of the Ru&s;&s;ian court, exchanged for a part of Hol&s;tein, with the prince of Gottorp, now make a very good principa|lity, containing 78,000 people, and yielding every year about 40,000l.

The court of Peter&s;burg brought up many of the&s;e hor&s;es to mount its heavy cavalry, who look very formidable on the&s;e terrible cattle. The Dutch cui|ra&s;&s;iers are &s;upplied from Hol&s;tein, and in fact, the hor&s;es of that country are preferable to tho&s;e of Frie&s;|land and Oldenburgh for this &s;ervice, and with the &s;ame &s;trength they connect more alacrity and life.&mdash; The Dutch call them <HI>va&s;t-trotters</HI>&mdash;they are too heavy to gallop, but will trot at an amazing pace, with a heavy drag behind them, for a whole day together. They are coal-black, &s;eventeen hands high, and very nobly cre&s;ted. The price of a pair of hand&s;ome ones, about fifteen years ago, was 120 pounds Engli&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>THE DUCHY OF CLEVE,</HEAD>
<P>Lies on both &s;ides the Rhine, and is bounded by part of Holland towards the north; by Mun&s;ter on the ea&s;t; Juliers on the &s;outh, and Brabant towards the we&s;t. It is &s;ixteen German miles in length, and be|tween four and five in breadth.</P>
<P>The air is &s;ound, and the weather moderate. This duchy has high lands and low bottoms; the former of the&s;e are furni&s;hed as well with arable-lands, as with bu&s;hes; the latter, particularly towards the Rhine,
<PB N="153" REF="159">
are, on both &s;ides fenced with &s;tout dams, exclu&s;ive of which, there are al&s;o &s;ummer-dams, which &s;creen the rich meadows and pa&s;tures lying near the river again&s;t the &s;ummer-water, to the heights of between eleven and &s;ixteen feet. This country abounds al&s;o in corn, fruits, and all manner of plants. The breed of horned cattle, and hor&s;es, is con&s;iderable. In general, the country is well cultivated, and contains many delightful &s;pots, particularly near the town of Cleve. All kinds of game are in great plenty here, in particular, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Rhine. The river divides the country into the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern parts, and receives in its cour&s;e, the rivers Roer, Ems, and Lippe. The Meu&s;e al&s;o touches on a part of the duchy. All the&s;e rivers abound in fi&s;h, and the &s;almon, pike and carp, of the Rhine, are in great re|que&s;t.</P>
<P>In this duchy are twenty-four towns, and three im|munities, or <HI>municipia.</HI> The inhabitants are chiefly catholics, but all religions are tolerated in this duchy. The country, in many parts, is mountainous and woody. The commerce of this country is very much facilitated by the navigation on the Rhine, and on the Meu&s;e. The &s;overeignty belongs to the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia, as elector of Brandenburgh, who&s;e ance&s;tors laid claim to it, in the beginning of the la&s;t century; by virtue of a marriage, with one of the co-heire&s;&s;es of the
<PB N="154" REF="160">
la&s;t prince of the male line in this duchy. This claim was confirmed by the emperor Leopold, in 1678.</P>
<P>The yearly revenues ari&s;ing to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, from this duchy, are e&s;timated at 356,000 rix-dollars, and the &s;um which goes to the war-che&s;t, at 340,000.</P>
<P>Cleves, the capital of the country, in Latin <HI>Clivia,</HI> derives its name from the town and citadel, being built on the declivity of a hill, between the Rhine and the Meu&s;e. It is large and well-built, but &s;urrounded by cliffs and craggy rocks, about twelve miles from Ni|meguen. The town is well peopled, but neither the city nor the citadel are of any great &s;trength. A &s;ilk manufactory was e&s;tabli&s;hed here in 1755. The en|virons are plea&s;ant, and in front of the gates are &s;ome very fine walks. From this place there is a canal runs into the Rhine, which is about three Engli&s;h miles di&s;tant. On the we&s;t-&s;ide of the town, lies the park of prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of Na&s;&s;au, very much admired for its grottos, canals, and fine water-works; and over the&s;e on a high hill, called the Sternberg, may be di&s;co|vered, at the di&s;tance of fifty miles, the city of Utrecht, with forty other cities and great towns, twelve of which, are &s;een through vi&s;tos, and at the end of each ap|pears a fine city.</P>
<P>The private hou&s;es in Cleves are very &s;habby, and the only public buildings of any note are the great
<PB N="155" REF="161">
church, a mona&s;tery of Capuchins and another of Franci&s;cans. As the King of Pru&s;&s;ia is &s;overeign of the country, the religion countenanced by government is Calvini&s;m; but mo&s;t of the churches are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the catholics. In the great hall of the citadel is an in&s;cription by which it appears that <HI>Caius Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> dictator in the year 698 from the building of Rome, having fir&s;t conquered the adjacent country founded the citadel of Cleve.</P>

<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITY OF EAST FRIEZLAND</HEAD>
<P>Is bounded by the German ocean on the north; by Oldenburg on the ea&s;t; by Groningen on the we&s;t, and by Mun&s;ter on the &s;outh. It is about ten Ger|man miles from north to &s;outh, and as many from ea&s;t to we&s;t.</P>
<P>This principality is &s;ituated in a moi&s;t and thick air, but much purified by the &s;ea-breezes. Spring and &s;ummer appear here &s;omewhat later than in other parts of Germany; hence al&s;o their corn-harve&s;t happens later. The country is throughout level and low; whence al&s;o it is &s;ecured by expen&s;ive dikes again&s;t the inroads of &s;ea-floods. Along the &s;ea lies a mar&s;h uncommonly fertile, which has a clay bottom, and is more u&s;ed for meadow and pa&s;|ture-land than for agriculture.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="162">The remarkably rich pa&s;tures of this country yield an important breed of cattle, producing horned cat|tle, hor&s;es and &s;heep in great numbers, and al&s;o of an extraordinary &s;ize. In the&s;e parts one cow will yield near twenty-four cans of milk, and from this very rich milk is made mo&s;t excellent butter and chee&s;e. On the contrary, in the heart of the country, the bot|tom is for the mo&s;t part &s;andy, as al&s;o fenny and moori&s;h, but yields turf for burning, which, in the great &s;carcity of fuel here, is very advantageous and indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the country. The greate&s;t part of the produce of the earth, as al&s;o culinary herbs grow to a large &s;ize, but are &s;eldom &s;o good as they are in other countries. Fowl and veni&s;on are al&s;o to be had, and there are gee&s;e, who&s;e weight exceeds twenty-four pounds. In harve&s;t, a great number of fieldfares and &s;nipes generally appear. The &s;ea here yields all &s;orts of fi&s;h, as oy&s;ters, mu&s;cles, &s;ea-crabs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The principal river is the Ems, which comes from the bi&s;hopric of Mun&s;ter, and runs through the Dol|lart into the North Sea. The Dollart is a bay between Ea&s;t Friezland and Groningen, which aro&s;e out of a con&s;iderable tract of country, and was &s;wallowed up by the &s;ea. For, in the year 1277, the water fir&s;t broke into this tract of land with a violent flood, and no proper oppo&s;ition being made to to it, the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="157" REF="163">
bay gradually aro&s;e, on who&s;e circuit there &s;tood formerly above fifty great and &s;mall towns.</P>
<P>Trade and navigation are carried on here very bri&s;k|ly. The produce of the country, and the commodi|ties exported hence are large hor&s;es (numbers of which are &s;ent to Rome and &s;old by the pair, in proportion to their &s;trength and beauty for three or four hundred dollars and more, and u&s;ed for coach hor&s;es) horned cattle, butter, chee&s;e, rape-&s;eed, and fine cloth. On the other hand, every thing the country is in want of, is conveyed hither by &s;hipping.</P>
<P>The land-&s;tates con&s;i&s;t of the nobility, and the &s;tates, as al&s;o of the villagers. Between the&s;e and the reign|ing hou&s;e certain articles of agreement have been gra|dually entered into, ever &s;ince the time of count <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the &s;econd, which, with the peculiar imperial or|dinances i&s;&s;ued at the &s;ame time are con&s;idered as pro|vincial laws in the government of the country. Ea&s;t Friezland has al&s;o many other privileges.</P>
<P>The ancient counts were created princes of the em|pire in 1554. This princely hou&s;e became extinct in 1744, upon which <HI>Frederic</HI> II. King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in con|&s;equence of an expectancy granted to the hou&s;e of Brandenburg, by the Emperor Leopold in 1604, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ea&s;t Friezland; a prote&s;t to which was
<PB N="158" REF="164">
made by the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wic&mdash;Luneburg, before the regency of Ea&s;t Friezland and the aulic council of the empire, who claims this principality by virtue of an alliance entered into in 1601 with Prince <HI>Chri&s;|tian Eberhard,</HI> a former-prince of Friezland.</P>
<P>Aurich, the ancient re&s;idence of the prince, and which is even to this day the &s;eat of the provincial college, &s;tands almo&s;t in the centre of the country. The ancient re&s;identiary ca&s;tle is &s;urrounded with ram|parts and ditches. In the garri&s;on church the Calvi|ni&s;ts perform their religious wor&s;hip. In the town it|&s;elf we &s;ee the Lutheran church, the provincial hou&s;e, the Latin &s;chools and a public alms-hou&s;e. So early as the year 1519, Aurich received the Lutheran doc|trine.</P>
<P>Emden, the chief city of the principality lies near the river Ems. It is a &s;trong &s;ea-port town, and a place of great trade. The hou&s;es are high and well built, and the town-hall is a magnificent &s;tructure. This place contains a harbour, an old fort, and a cita|del belonging to the prince and lying on the Ems, to which the &s;hips arrive by means of a broad canal drawn from that river, called the Dolf. From this city there is a fine pro&s;pect of the German Ocean, and likewi&s;e of the adjacent country.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="165">The things principally worthy of notice here are the town-hall and council-hou&s;e, the library and the great church. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants are prote&s;tants or Calvini&s;ts, and there are &s;ome Lutherans, catholics and Jews. In 1750, an A&s;iatic company was e&s;tabli&s;hed here by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>Emden, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> is by no means &s;o fine a city as Bremen. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia has taken an everla&s;t|ing di&s;like to the inhabitants, who, to &s;ay the truth, when taken in the lump, are not the mo&s;t amiable peo|ple. They are very remarkable for their lazine&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility. It was a great while before the good en|deavours of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, its &s;overeign, to turn this people to commerce and &s;hip-building were at|tended with any &s;ucce&s;s. The Ea&s;t-India Company, which he had e&s;tabli&s;hed at a great expence, was ruined within a few years of its erection, and certain republican prejudices, which the burgers of this city affected, rendered all the King's other efforts for a time ineffectual. At length the activity and wi&s;|dom of the government, attended with &s;ome fortunate circum&s;tances, got the better of the impediments to that exten&s;ion of commerce, for which the city is par|ticularly well &s;ituated. The herring-fi&s;hery, which the King took every &s;tep, in his power, to encourage, brings in large &s;ums of money every year. The Ame|rican war a&s;&s;i&s;ted the King's de&s;igns very much, and the
<PB N="160" REF="166">
trade of the place now begins to be very flouri&s;hing. Emden exports many We&s;tphalian linens to the &s;outh countries, and provides a part of We&s;tphalia with &s;pices and wines. They have al&s;o a con&s;iderable trade in chee&s;e.</P>
<P>The revenues ari&s;ing from this principality are very con&s;iderable. They, many years ago, greatly exceeded 100,000 rix-dollars, and &s;ince it came under the Pru&s;&s;ian regency, have been very con&s;iderably in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The principality con&s;i&s;ts at this time of three towns and nine prefecturates, which were formerly lord&s;hips, but are now in like manner with the towns, hereditary and proper e&s;tates of the &s;overeign prince, as al&s;o of lord&s;hips which have their own hereditary lords, but are &s;ubject to the &s;overeign, &s;upreme juri&s;diction of the prince.</P>

<HEAD>PYRMONT.</HEAD>
<P>This country lies between the bi&s;hopric of Pader|born, and the electorate of Hanover. The lower part of it contains an uncommonly beautiful and plea&s;ant vale, which extends four miles in length, and as many in breadth. All around is environed by lofty green mountains. In this vale are the celebrated mineral-&s;prings and &s;teel-waters. This country is now &s;ub|ject
<PB N="161" REF="167">
to the Prince of Waldeck. His annual revenues, as &s;overeign of this country, are e&s;timated at near 30,000 rix-dollars, to which the mineral &s;prings con|tribute a very great proportion.</P>
<P>The&s;e waters are often frequented by per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia has been known to drink them. They are exceedingly palatable, and come neare&s;t to the Seltzer-waters, in their ta&s;te and their qualities. Pyrmont is about a day's journey from Hanover; to which place, there is a very fine road, mo&s;t part of the way with very large and well en|graved &s;tones, every quarter of a German mile, men|tioning the exact di&s;tance from Hanover; a circum|&s;tance very unu&s;ual on the continent. After Spa, every place of this kind appears in&s;ipid. Yet in the &s;ea&s;on, there is a great deal of very good company from Hanover, and the other large cities in the north of Germany. A very magnificent hotel or inn, for the accommodation of &s;trangers, has been lately built, where the apartments are fitted up in the mo&s;t modern ta&s;te, and the charges not &s;o extravagant as the ap|pearance of the out&s;ide of the building is magnifi|cent. This hotel is much &s;uperior to any even at Spa. There is, as in mo&s;t inns of Germany, an ex|ceeding good <HI>table d'hote,</HI> of two or three cour&s;es&mdash;with variety of good wines for very moderate prices. Were not the approach to this place on the &s;ide of

Holland and France, &s;o exceedingly di&s;agreeable, owing to the heavy &s;ands of We&s;tphalia, it would be much more frequented than it is at pre&s;ent. They have their public rooms every night, and their a&s;&s;em|blies, and their pharo-banks, as in other watering-places, but every thing here is on a &s;mall &s;cale, to what it is at Aix-la-chappelle and at Spa. Neither is the country round about it &s;o diver&s;ified and pictu|re&s;que. The country is more open and more level; nor are the mountains &s;o finely wooded. On the contrary, the rooms, where the company meet, lie, as it were, in a hole, near the &s;pring-head; and not only carry with them the appearance of great antiquity, but they are al&s;o very gloomy, and &s;eem &s;ituated, as it were, in a &s;wamp, &s;urrounded with wood. For tho&s;e, however, to whom the drinking of the waters is any induce|ment for repairing hither, there are but few watering-places, where they will meet with &s;uch excellent ac|commodations, more re&s;ources of amu&s;ement, or a greater variety of good and re&s;pectable company.</P>

On the top of the fountain, is a large bra&s;s &s;tatue of <HI>Charlemagne,</HI> in gilt armour, with his face towards Germany. On the edge of the ci&s;tern, is an in&s;cription, which mentions, that <HI>Granus,</HI> a Roman prince, was the fir&s;t per&s;on who di&s;covered and built the hot-baths in this city. On the in&s;ide of the cathedral, where <HI>Charlemagne</HI> was fir&s;t interred, hangs a very large crown made of &s;ilver and bra&s;s, gilt, &s;urrounded with forty-eight &s;tatues, a foot high, and thirty-two le&s;&s;er ones, all of &s;olid &s;il|ver. The emperor <HI>Frederic,</HI> removed the body of <HI>Char|lemagne,</HI> buried part of it in the choir, under the al|tar, in a &s;ilver coffin, and covered it with a tomb&s;tone of white marble; with the bu&s;t of Pro&s;erpine upon it, &s;uppo&s;ed to have covered <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar's</HI> tomb.</P>

<P>The territory of the city is called the kingdom of Aix-la Chapella, and lies quite round it. In it are to the number of three thou&s;and &s;ubjects.

<P>The city of Aix profe&s;&s;ed the prote&s;tant religion &s;oon after the Reformation, on which account the people were very much harra&s;&s;ed by the Imperiali&s;ts during the civil wars of Germany; till at la&s;t popery was e&s;tabli&s;hed again, and is now the only religion publicly profe&s;&s;ed by the inhabitants; but prote&s;tants are permitted to re&s;ide here, and go to a church with|out the walls, under the dominion of the Dutch.</P>
<P>The emperors were u&s;ually crowned in this city for five hundred years after <HI>Charlemagne,</HI> and by the golden-bull, made in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> IV. the em|peror was to receive his fir&s;t crown here; but the cu&s;tom of crowning him with three crowns, as was formerly the way, hath been long &s;ince di&s;continued; and at every coronation, the magi&s;trates, who have the cu&s;tody of <HI>Charlemagne</HI>'s &s;word, &s;houlder-belt, and the go&s;pel in golden letters, which are u&s;ed in that ceremony, deliver them to the elector of Mentz, and the emperor declares, that his being crowned el&s;e|where, &s;hall not prejudice the privileges of the city of Aix.</P>

above-mentioned, really found in the &s;epulchre of <HI>Charlemagne,</HI> and con&s;equently it mu&s;t be at lea&s;t nine hundred years old; it is written on fine thin paper, or vellum, &s;omething like gold-beaters &s;kin, twenty-times doubled; the characters are in large ca|pitals, well pre&s;erved and quite clean, except at the beginning of St. John's go&s;pel; but there it is much &s;oiled, becau&s;e all the emperors were &s;worn on this book at their coronation; and there it was, &s;aid <HI>T</HI>&mdash;. they laid their dirty hands.</P>
<P>The degree of cultivation, and riches of We&s;tpha|lia, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> far exceeded all ideas I had formed of them, and quite a&s;toni&s;hed me. All the cities and villages abound in trade&s;people. Muhlheim, Elber|feld, Solingen, Sor&s;t, Ham, Duisburg, Meurs, We|&s;el, Cleve, and &s;ome other cities have capital manu|factures in them. They make a great quantity of linen and woollen, and &s;upply almo&s;t all the country of the Upper Rhine, Suabia, and Franconia, with white threads; they have be&s;ides manufactures of handker|chiefs, &s;ilks, and cottons; they prepare &s;teel and iron at Solingen, better than in any other part of Europe, England alone excepted.

<P>This wonderful indu&s;try, united to the natural fer|tility of the country, renders this one of the riche&s;t,

and mo&s;t remarkable parts of Germany; a gentle ad|mini&s;tration, and a &s;ecurity again&s;t de&s;poti&s;m, derived from the &s;tates of the country, contribute not a little to the happine&s;s of this circle. The inhabitants are chearful, ho&s;pitable, and well-mannered; they may be quoted, as a new in&s;tance to be added to the num|berle&s;s ones, already given of the little influence which religion has over the civil condition of men, when not attended with other local circum&s;tances. Though the prote&s;tants in this circle are far from being &s;o enlight|ened, or &s;o tolerant, as tho&s;e of their per&s;ua&s;ion in other countries; and though they are much more ad|dicted to &s;en&s;ual enjoyments, than their brethren of other places, they are the mo&s;t indu&s;trious people, and the be&s;t &s;ubjects that can be found; nor does the bigotry of the Catholics hurt the manufactures and agriculture of the country, their education only direc|ing it to &s;uch objects as have no connection with man|ners or civil &s;ociety. Every thing, therefore, depends upon the habits amid&s;t which men grow up.&mdash; When once indu&s;try is habitual to a people, the mo&s;t object &s;uper&s;tition will have no influence on their tem|poral felicity; the prie&s;ts them&s;elves will render their &s;ermons conformable to the manners of the country, nor will the monki&s;h theori&s;ts be able to overturn them.</P>
<P>There are as many legends in this country, as in Cologne, nor are the people le&s;s fond of proce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="169" REF="175">
and pilgrimage, and yet they are infinitely more in|du&s;trious, more frugal, and more wealthy than at Co|logne. It is not therefore the fault of the religion, or &s;uper&s;tition, but of the government alone, that the people of Cologne are &s;o debauched, and that the prie&s;ts of the place openly recommend debauchery, a loo&s;e education having made their religion prejudicial to them. The corporation-&s;y&s;tem, which with more activity and cleverne&s;s would have been a ble&s;&s;ing to the country, is become the cur&s;e of it. In a word, police, government, and executive ju&s;tice, are &s;ub|ject, under a weak admini&s;tration, to the &s;ame abu&s;es as government; nor is it religion it&s;elf, but the abu&s;es of it, which make it prejudicial to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The upper part of We&s;tphalia, which lies at a greater di&s;tance from the Rhine, is not &s;o well cul|tivated, and by nature is much le&s;s productive, than the lower part; it is occupied by many heaths and mora&s;&s;es, which, for the mo&s;t part, produce only turf, and, in the better places, dyer's-wood. Some parts of the country, &s;uch as part of the duchy of Minden and marqui&s;ate of Tecklenburg, are remarkably well peo|pled, but this is compen&s;ated by the &s;triking depopu|lation of &s;ome others; as for in&s;tance, of the bi&s;hop|rics of Mun&s;ter, O&s;naburg, and Paderborn, the mar|qui&s;ate of Bentheim, and &s;ome domains in the electo|rate of Hanover.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="176">This part of We&s;tphalia, however, is the proper country for hemp and flax, which are &s;ome of the riche&s;t products of this country. The greate&s;t part of the hemp and flax, manufactured in the&s;e parts of We&s;tphalia, about the Rhine, Holland, the Au&s;trian Netherlands, and the French Netherlands, comes from this part of the country. Be&s;ides, there is a great part exported raw to England, Spain, Por|tugal, and America. Though the&s;e productions are found, in great plenty, in other parts of Germany, particularly in the electorate of Hanover, the circle of Lower Saxony, He&s;&s;e, Waldeck, and Fulde; it is a que&s;tion, whether all the flax and hemp of the other parts of Germany, taken together, are equivalent to the quantity found here. According to a very accu|rate e&s;timate, the annual exports of raw and &s;pun flax and hemp, out of the &s;ingle circle of We&s;tphalia, amounts to five millions &s;terling, which, with what is exported, worked up, amounts to 200,000l more.</P>
<P>To enter Holland, from the &s;ide of We&s;tphalia, appears to be going out of a pig-&s;ty into a fine gar|den. The country round Nimeguen e&s;pecially, is a &s;triking contra&s;t to what is &s;een in We&s;tphalia. The magnificence and regularity of the Dutch cities, how|ever, &s;oon becomes tire&s;ome in the extreme. All the cities, villages, roads, and canals, are &s;o &s;imilar, that they appear copies of the &s;elf-&s;ame individual picture.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the CIRCLE of BURGUNDY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS circle is one of tho&s;e that are wholly catholic. The greate&s;t part of its territories have been torn from it. France has gradually brought under her domi|nion the duchy of Lorrain, which was reckoned in the circle of Burgundy, and a part of the duchy of Lux|emburg, with a part of the counties of Flanders, Ar|tois, Burgundy, Hennegau and Namur. The pro|vinces of Gelderland, Holland, Zealand, Utrecht, Friezland, Overy&s;&s;el, and Groningen, have united and are become independent; nay, they have even reduced under their &s;ubjection, a part of the duchies
<PB N="172" REF="179">
of Brabant and Limburg, and part of the country of Flanders, with the town of Mae&s;tricht and its terri|tory.</P>
<P>Thus the circle of Burgundy con&s;i&s;ts now only of the principal part of the duchies of Brabant, Lim|burg, Luxemburg, part of the counties of Flanders, Hennegau, and Namur, and part of the upper quar|ter of Gelderland.</P>
<P>The&s;e territories now belong to one &s;ingle lord; the archduke of Au&s;tria, who repre&s;ents the whole circle, and is &s;ole-director, and circle-&s;ummoning prince of it.</P>
<P>The people of this country have in them a natural &s;pirit of revolt, like their neighbours the French. They covet to be free, and indeed the unlimited pow|er of their &s;overeigns, and the oppre&s;&s;ion they have con&s;tantly laboured under, from an arbitrary govern|ment, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, ju&s;tifies their oppo&s;ition. It was the tyranny of the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> their governor in the reign of <HI>Philip</HI> II. of Spain, who was then &s;o|vereign of Brabant, that occa&s;ioned their revolt in his time; and it was their di&s;like to the emperor <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> II. their late &s;overeign, that brought on the la&s;t rebellion, quelled by the emperor <HI>Leopold.</HI> Indeed, &s;o powerful were the princes of the empire, in early ages, that they were lords of life and death, and could take away life
<PB N="173" REF="180">
without trial, merely by their mandate. In the hi&s;|tory of Brabant we have the following intere&s;ting &s;tory.</P>
<P><HI>Sifroi,</HI> Count Palatine, having married a beautiful young woman, but of no great family or connexions, was called to the holy wars &s;oon after his marriage. The &s;pirit of the times led him to this enterprize with|out much reluctance, except that of leaving his young wife behind him, whom he feared might be induced to di&s;honour him in his ab&s;ence. He left her, how|ever, in the care of a friend, one of the principal officers of his e&s;tabli&s;hment, and de&s;ired he might be made acquainted, from time to time, with her con|duct, and the &s;tate of her health. The beauty of this lady attracted the love of her guardian, and in his &s;o|vereign's ab&s;ence, he endeavoured to corrupt her principles, and rob his lord of that fidelity &s;he owed him. Finding her aver&s;e to his &s;olicitations, and un|conquerable, his love was converted into hatred, and when he next wrote to his &s;overeign, he traduced her character, and repre&s;ented her as having defiled his bed, with a menial &s;ervant of his hou&s;hold, and thus di&s;honoured his name. <HI>Sifroi,</HI> on the receipt of this intelligence, was thunder&s;truck, and the more &s;o, as no former letter had given him the lea&s;t intimation of her attempting to deviate from the line of virtue. The po&s;&s;ibility of a fal&s;e report, and his love for his lady, operated in her favour; but then his pride took
<PB N="174" REF="181">
the alarm, and, as of two pa&s;&s;ions in conte&s;t, the evil one is generally predominant, &s;o it was here. With|out con&s;ideration, in the impetuo&s;ity of temper, he re|turned an immediate an&s;wer to this fal&s;e friend, &s;aying, if the proofs were glaring, he de&s;ired to be rid of her; but the mode of putting her to death he left to this officer. On the arrival of this mandate, he made a fre&s;h attempt upon her virtue, armed with the power of taking away her life on her non-compliance. Still &s;he was firm and invincible, and the con&s;equence was, that her death was pronounced. Unwilling to bring her to a public execution, le&s;t his treachery &s;hould be di&s;|covered, he hired an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to take her into a neigh|bouring wood, and there di&s;patch and bury her.</P>
<P>This being &s;ettled, the man left her, cut her name upon a rock, and told his &s;avage employer, that he had executed his commi&s;&s;ion, and buried her in the fore&s;t, near the place where her name was engraved.</P>
<P>It happened at this time that &s;he was pregnant. She &s;oon however found a retreat in a cave, and here &s;he took up her abode, nature in due time performing her own office, and &s;he was delivered of a fine girl, which the &s;tory &s;ays, was &s;uckled by a doe, which Providence had &s;ent to be its nur&s;e; for her di&s;tre&s;s, and angui&s;h of mind had rendered her unable to perform that en|dearing ta&s;k her&s;elf. She lived &s;even years, with her infant, in this &s;olitary de&s;art, feeding on wild herbs and roots, and a&s;&s;ociating with the tamer animals of
<PB REF="182">

<PB N="175" REF="183">
the fore&s;t. Her cloaths were worn out, and &s;he was obliged to go naked, without any other covering than her long hair, which reached below her wai&s;t.</P>
<P>The officer, who &s;uppo&s;ed her dead, being inform|ed of the unexpected return of his &s;overeign, fearing a di&s;covery of his treachery, and not able to bear the reproaches of his own mind, put an end to his exi&s;t|ence; and when <HI>Sifroi</HI> came back, and the whole mat|ter was unravelled, he too &s;oon, for his peace, learned the innocence of his wife, and the treachery and end of him to whom he had entru&s;ted her; and would have given the world not to have &s;ent his cruel mandate, ha&s;tily di&s;patched in a moment of phrenzy; but it was then too late, the deed, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, was done.</P>
<P>Hunting &s;ome time afterwards in this fore&s;t, and &s;traying from his party, chance led him to the rock where her name was cut. Startled at the &s;ight, he be|came motionle&s;s upon his hor&s;e. In a moment or two his &s;en&s;es returned, but returned with bitterne&s;s. Stung with remor&s;e, and overpowered with di&s;tre&s;s, he could only &s;igh and weep. <HI>Genevieve,</HI> who&s;e fears were always awake for her&s;elf and her little one, dreading a di&s;covery that &s;he was &s;till in being, had been wandering in &s;earch of food, and returning to her cave at the time <HI>Sifroi</HI>'s eyes were fixed upon the rock; little expecting to meet any thing in &s;o &s;eque&s;|tered a part, fled to her abode, and &s;creamed as &s;he fled. <HI>Sifroi,</HI> at the noi&s;e turned in&s;tantly round, and
<PB N="176" REF="184">
ju&s;t obtained the glimp&s;e of her as &s;he entered. Ap|proaching the cave's mouth, he cried out, "What is that voice? Is it a human voice?" "It is," &s;he an&s;wered. "Then come forth," he cried. "Throw me your coat," returned &s;he, "and I will, for I am naked." He accordingly did &s;o, and to his great a&s;toni&s;hment and joy, di&s;covered both his wife and his child. The inclemency of the weather, and her hard fare, throwing a brown hue over her, had made &s;ome alteration in her features, but her beauty had not left her. She became more amiable in his eyes from the calamity &s;he had experienced; though de&s;titute of dre&s;s, &s;he was cloathed with innocence, and returned un&s;ullied to his arms.</P>

<P>The length of which is rated at twenty-two, and its breadth twenty German miles, was formerly the fir&s;t in rank of all the &s;eventeen provinces in the Nether|lands.

<P><PB N="177" REF="185">In the Au&s;trian part of Brabant are reckoned nine|teen walled towns, and a con&s;iderable number of im|munities enjoying the rights of burghers and towns.</P>
<P>The whole country profe&s;&s;es the Romi&s;h church. In the year 1559, an archbi&s;hopric was erected at Mecklin, and to it was a&s;&s;igned the primacy of Bel|gium.

<P>The duchy of Brabant belonged formerly to the Franki&s;h monarchy. Afterwards it became part of the Lotharingian kingdom, and a fief of the German empire. In cour&s;e of time it de&s;cended to <HI>Philip</HI> II. of Spain.</P>
<P>The republic of the United Netherlands, in the 17th century, made it&s;elf ma&s;ter of the northern part of the duchy of Brabant, which it retained at the peace of We&s;tphalia. The emperor <HI>Charles</HI> VI. in the

<P>Louvain is a very large and plea&s;ant town, with an old ca&s;tle, and a celebrated univer&s;ity. The walls of this place are near &s;even miles in circumference, but within them are a great many gardens and vineyards. The public buildings are magnificent, and the uni|ver&s;ity con&s;i&s;ts of a great number of colleges. The town was formerly in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate, owing to the noble manufactures of linen and woollen cloth e&s;ta|bli&s;hed here, which in the beginning of the 14th cen|tury, maintained upwards of 150,000 workmen, but the cloth-weavers making an in&s;urrection in 1382, and being puni&s;hed on that account, &s;ome of them with|drew to England, and with its manufactures the town likewi&s;e decayed. The place at pre&s;ent is chiefly re|markable for its good beer, with which it &s;erves the neighbouring towns. The fortifications are not very &s;trong, and yet it boa&s;ts of never having been taken, except by the French, in 1746. It is &s;aid, there are no fewer than forty one colleges belonging to this uni|ver&s;ity.</P>

It was furiou&s;ly bombarded by the French for forty-&s;ix hours, in 1695, by which four|teen churches, and above 4000 hou&s;es were reduced to a&s;hes, but in four years all were rebuilt again, far more beautiful. In 1706, the allies made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of this place, and in 1746, the French.

The public buildings, the palaces and courts of the &s;everal princes, counts, and other per&s;ons of condition here, together with the churches and cloy|&s;ters, are &s;ome of them con&s;iderable, and &s;ome magni|ficent.

<P>Among the churches of Bru&s;&s;els, there are &s;ome that well de&s;erve notice. St. Gudula is a very re|markable gothic pile, highly ornamented with mo|numents, chapels, pictures, &amp;c. The je&s;uits church has al&s;o &s;everal objects to attract the attention of &s;tran|gers. One whole &s;ide of the great market &s;quare, is taken up with the town-hou&s;e, which is a mo&s;t &s;tupen|dous quadrangular building, with a fine cupola, and a pretty gothic front; the apartment in which the &s;tates of Brabant meet, is very magnificent; the hi&s;|tory of <HI>Charles</HI> V. is worked in tape&s;try, with a brilli|ancy of colouring, that is almo&s;t inconceivable, the manufacture of the place, and covers one of the apart|ments. There are likewi&s;e other apartments which contain many original paintings, by the greate&s;t Fle|mi&s;h ma&s;ters. Another great advantage the market-place
<PB N="181" REF="189">
enjoys, is being &s;urrounded with the corpora|tion-halls of different trades, the fronts of which being uniform, and adorned, make a fine circumference.</P>
<P>The archduke's palace, though an old irregular building, erected at different times, &s;hould not be pa&s;&s;ed over unnoticed. It is a very large edifice, and the apartments are extremely &s;pacious and well fur|ni&s;hed. Behind it, is a large park well &s;tocked with deer. There are al&s;o many very plea&s;ant walks in it, and a &s;ummer-hou&s;e built by the emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V.</P>
<P>Among other edifices u&s;ually viewed, are the pa|laces of Orange, De Ligne, Epinoy, Rubengue, Eg|mont, Aremberg, Ar&s;chot, and Bournonville. In the gardens of the latter, you have a fine view of Bru&s;&s;els and the adjacent country. The only objects of much con&s;ideration in the&s;e palaces are the paintings, among which, particularly in the palace of the duke of A|remberg, are many very capital pieces, not only by Flemi&s;h, but al&s;o by Italian ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>As to the diver&s;ions of Bru&s;&s;els, there is a very large opera-hou&s;e and two theatres, in which French comedies are played. The opera-hou&s;e is very &s;paci|ous, but ill lighted. In&s;tead of boxes, it has large clo&s;ets like the Italian theatres, which contain tables, chairs, a fire place, &amp;c. &s;o that parties are formed for cards and conver&s;ation during the performance. But
<PB N="182" REF="190">
the prices are too low to admit of any &s;plendid en|tertainment; their performers are but very moderate, and bad mu&s;ic, is an entertainment that will not be re|li&s;hed by tho&s;e who are in the lea&s;t acquainted with the luxury of an Engli&s;h or an Italian opera.</P>
<P>The court gives an air of liveline&s;s to Bru&s;&s;els, which is not to be met with in the other cities of Flan|ders. What with the officers about the per&s;on of the governor-general; the re&s;idence of a con&s;iderable mi|litary force; the chief courts of ju&s;tice, with no &s;light portion of trade and manufacture, this place is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and chearful re&s;idence in Flanders.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h re&s;ident here, &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> con&s;i&s;t chiefly of per&s;ons of &s;mall fortune, who come to Bru&s;|&s;els, in order to give their children a good education; of young men on travelling excur&s;ions, and of the unfortunate and indigent.</P>
<P>Now and then a family of good fortune ventures upon a winter here; but I never heard of one, &s;ays he, who did not quit the place with more than common di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>There are few capitals in Europe, in which provi|&s;ions, and almo&s;t all other expences incidental to a fa|mily are &s;o rea&s;onable as in this city. It is even &s;aid, that a family may live here upon two hundred pounds
<PB N="183" REF="191">
a year, as well as upon &s;ix hundred in England. But this we apprehend is rather exaggerated. There are two articles of expence in this city which exceeds mo&s;t other places, hou&s;e-rent and firing. There is no hiring a &s;mall decent hou&s;e under thirty or forty pounds a year; and in the article of firing, which is wood, where there are no &s;toves, two or three &s;hil|lings a day in cold weather, may be &s;oon expended without economy on a &s;ingle fire. Provi&s;ions, parti|cularly vegetables, of which there are no finer any where, and all the articles of dre&s;s, and likewi&s;e car|riages, &s;ervants, and public diver&s;ions, are cheaper here than in mo&s;t places. The education of children likewi&s;e, which <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, many peo|ple believe, to con&s;i&s;t in French, dancing, and a tinc|ture of foreign manners, may be obtained upon much more moderate terms in Bru&s;&s;els, than in any part of England.</P>
<P>The number of &s;u&s;picious characters who re&s;ort hither from England, makes the natives, as well as the Engli&s;h of any re&s;pectability, remarkably &s;hy towards &s;trangers of our own country. The&s;e &s;u&s;picious cha|racters con&s;i&s;t of two &s;orts, either of &s;uch as have had &s;ome &s;tigma affixed upon them in England, &s;o that no per&s;on, of any character could a&s;&s;ociate with them, without con&s;idering him&s;elf, as reflected upon in &s;o doing; or they are compo&s;ed of per&s;ons, who hav|ing nothing morally bad about them, yet confiding in
<PB N="184" REF="192">
their riches, which they blazon forth, a&s;&s;uming a con|&s;equence to which neither their manners nor their connections, give them the lea&s;t preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>The&s;e latter characters, <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e</HI> has drawn in ra|ther too glowing colours. As for the women, &s;ays he, there are &s;ome of them who attend the winter balls of the Bru&s;&s;els court, that never advanced farther at St. James's, than to &s;ee beneath the arm-pit of a beef-eater, the Sunday proce&s;&s;ion of our royal family to and from the chapel-royal. Some of the&s;e poor people are driven almo&s;t to <HI>&s;tarvation,</HI> in order to furni&s;h the ne|ce&s;&s;ary decorations of a court appearance; though for the comfort of their pur&s;e, and the con&s;olation of their &s;tomachs, it requires nothing more than the common dre&s;s of genteel life. Of this number are in&s;tanced two antiquated ladies, whom he &s;tiles late of the pump room at Bath, without a fortune to bear it, or a word of the language to &s;upport it, were pre&s;ented at this court. It was very bleak that day, and as the weather is generally a &s;ubject for &s;trangers to begin with, the archduche&s;s ob&s;erved, it was very cold, and repeated the words <HI>bien froid,</HI> two or three times, le&s;t they might not under&s;tand her. At length, one of the ladies believing the archduche&s;s a&s;ked them to &s;tay dinner, and that it was a nice fry they were to participate of, curt&s;ied, and replied, that whether it was fried or broiled, &s;o they had the honour of dining at court, it was equal to them. To avoid &s;uch things
<PB N="185" REF="193">
happening in future, it is now the etiquette at the court of Bru&s;&s;els, that no Briti&s;h &s;ubject &s;hall be pre|&s;ented there by our mini&s;ter, who has not previou&s;ly been pre&s;ented at St. James's.</P>
<P>We take the liberty here to pre&s;ent to our readers, <HI>Thickne&s;&s;es</HI>'s hints to a per&s;on of fa&s;hion, who propo|&s;es to make Bru&s;&s;els his winter-re&s;idence. If a young man of fortune and rank is fond of play, there is no &s;ociety &s;o re&s;pectable in any quarter of the globe, in which there are not &s;ome characters who would take ad|vantage of this foible to his utter ruin, and de&s;truc|tion, if he was &s;illy enough to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be en|&s;nared. Bru&s;&s;els therefore ought not to be exempt from &s;uch characters, at the &s;ame time, we believe the noble&s;&s;e of that capital to be as highly reputable in general, as at any of our own court.</P>
<P>Were you to make this city as you propo&s;e, your next winter's abode, you would of cour&s;e be pre|&s;ented to the little, but elegant court held here, the con&s;equence of which is a round of vi&s;its mu&s;t be made to all the noble&s;&s;e who attend it, and who form that brilliant a&s;&s;embly. The&s;e vi&s;its will all be punc|tually returned; for tho&s;e &s;trangers who are young and rich, will find a prince, a duke, a count, or a ba|ron, who will intimate to them, that by a little ad|dre&s;s, they may be admitted into the GRAND SO|CIETY. Profe&s;&s;ions of regard due to &s;trangers, good
<PB N="186" REF="194">
breeding, artful flattery, fine women, &s;umptuous ta|bles, are all thrown in the way of a young man of for|tune, to cover the real cau&s;e of &s;o much attention: &s;ee him &s;eated between a duche&s;s and a counte&s;s, both po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the charms of beauty, graced with the mo&s;t ea&s;y and captivating French manners, a noble repa&s;t before him, and the mo&s;t delicious wines at his elbow, thus placed and being a &s;tranger the attention of the whole table appears to be employed to make him happy, and if in &s;uch a &s;ituation a young man of fa&s;hion in a &s;trange country, does not feel him&s;elf &s;o, where is happine&s;s to be found, almo&s;t every pa&s;&s;ion of man is gratified, nor does he go to &s;leep without flat|tering him&s;elf he is in a fair way of being admitted, t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te, with one or more of the charming women with whom he enjoyed &s;uch a happy evening. The next night, he meets the &s;ame agreeable &s;ociety, and finds him&s;elf as much at home and at his ea&s;e, as if he was at his own manor hou&s;e. In this &s;ituation the &s;tranger who knows he is a very hand&s;ome young man, no doubt forms &s;ome plan of further happine&s;s, without &s;u&s;pecting that many of the party who are not &s;o rich as he is, would not di&s;like a draught on his banker or even a mortgage on his e&s;tate, and as both &s;exes con&s;tantly play in this country, it may be pre|&s;umed both under&s;tand it very well: My Lord An|glois, of cour&s;e, is one of the party, and if he wins of a lady, it gives him an opportunity of &s;hewing his good breeding; if of a prince, or a duke, why it is
<PB N="187" REF="195">
honour enough to have &s;uch great per&s;onages his debtors; but if he lo&s;es, and it is ten to one but he does, he mu&s;t pay directly; for every body here knows that an Engli&s;hman has &s;o much money, that if it were not for continental excur&s;ions, they could not tell what to do with it. Now, &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed this is an imaginary picture &s;ketched out without an original to copy from. I will come to a matter of fact. I found here a young gentleman of Ireland, of genteel appearance, of good addre&s;s, and of ea&s;y fortune; a member of this grand &s;ociety, and living in a degree of intimacy with the fir&s;t people. On his fir&s;t arrival he lo&s;t, as mo&s;t fir&s;t comers do, a con&s;iderable &s;um of money to a native of high birth, and of cour&s;e paid it. At &s;ome di&s;|tance of time they played again, and the &s;tranger be|came the winner of a &s;um even greater than that which he lo&s;t a year or two before; but in&s;tead of being paid he was informed by his antagoni&s;t, that he was not to receive his fortune as a younger brother till he was thirty, and therefore de&s;ired to be per|mitted to pay the debt by in&s;tallments, and engaged the winner to give his word he would not let his bro|ther know what had pa&s;&s;ed. The pais-bas peer, however, never made good his engagements; went to Paris, would neither an&s;wer letter, nor pay drafts made upon him; and therefore having cancelled all former obligations, the &s;tranger determined to lay the matter open to his brother, but what was the con|&s;equence?
<PB N="188" REF="196">
&mdash;"He was a&s;ked if they did not know that they were the fir&s;t people of the country, and was told that his brother wore a &s;word. But finding that &s;uch pais-bas hauteur would not do, and that the young &s;tranger wore a &s;word too, &s;ome mode of mo|derating matters was to be employed. Another great man related to the former, then &s;teps forward, cen|&s;ures the conduct of the two brothers, opens his doors wider than ever to the &s;tranger, and &s;oftens him into more patience. It may now be imagined he is paid, no &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> nor ever will. Is it not enough to have the honour of dining with a prince, &s;upping with a duke, and dancing with a duche&s;s, without being paid a thou&s;and pounds or two?"</P>
<P>The wine that is generally met with in Bru&s;&s;els is bad. The wine merchants it is &s;aid have a method of brewing &s;everal &s;orts of wine, and particularly what they call Burgundy, with pigeons dung, and an arti|ficial &s;weet wine palatable enough, in which a quan|tity of brim&s;tone is infu&s;ed, called Mo&s;elle. The wines made from the hills adjacent to the Rhine, with which this country is plentifully &s;upplied, is, perhaps, of all fermented liquors the be&s;t; this wine, in my opinion, &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> and he was a judge, when pro|cured genuine, is &s;uperior to all others. It improves both in &s;trength and flavour, in proportion to a cer|tain age. For it is a great mi&s;take to imagine wine cannot be too old. There is a time when wine as
<PB N="189" REF="197">
well as men arrive at maturity; after which wines, as well as men, lo&s;e &s;ome part of their original vigour; for though they give travellers wines to ta&s;te of an hundred years or more, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that as they &s;ell great quantities every year from their large re&s;ervoir tons, &s;o they as con&s;tantly fill them up an|nually with new wines. If therefore a per&s;on &s;ends to Frankfort for the be&s;t Rheni&s;h wine, not for hock, he will in a few years have hock in his cellar at half price. It is inconceivable what a variety of excellent wines this country and Hungary produces, the latter very little known; all of which are &s;uperior to French or Spani&s;h wines, except, perhaps, Burgundy and Cham|pagne of the fir&s;t growth in good wines.</P>
<P>It is a great mi&s;take to imagine that the wines in Germany are apt to create the gout; they may, it is true, be unfit for tho&s;e who have the gout, or the &s;eeds of that di&s;order in their con&s;titution; but in &s;ound bodies, it is more likely to prevent than to promote a gouty habit. In Champagne, where the wine of the country is con&s;tantly drank, there are few or no gouty people; and real Champagne is a very whole&s;ome wine.</P>
<P>No part of the continent can long continue agree|able to an Engli&s;hman, who has been accu&s;tomed to live even with that decency which the Engli&s;h of mid|dling fortunes live in their own country. For this
<PB N="190" REF="198">
rea&s;on it is that the Engli&s;h nation alone are the lea&s;t &s;atisfied with the fare they meet with abroad. The neatne&s;s of our hou&s;es, the cleanline&s;s of our butchers, bakers, &amp;c. render the hou&s;es, &s;hops, and manufactur|ers of what we eat and drink on the continent highly di&s;gu&s;tful. The &s;ervants and boys of the bakers in the Low Countries, and in France, are the dirtie&s;t mi&s;erable looking people on earth, no part of their per|&s;ons being clean but their legs and feet, for they are always vi&s;ible; and though the tables of all orders of people are covered with a variety of di&s;hes, which may catch the eye, or provoke the appetite, an En|gli&s;hman, who&s;e &s;tomach is not depraved, will &s;oon wi&s;h to &s;ee a plain whole&s;ome di&s;h or two of meat, <HI>&agrave; la mode d'Angleterre</HI> &s;et before him.</P>
<P>Knaves of many nations, &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> have fled to this city under the idea they were beyond the reach of tho&s;e they meant to defraud, not knowing that in Brabant and in all the Low Countries a per&s;on may be arre&s;ted for debts contracted in any other; and that not only men, but women and children are &s;ubject to impri&s;onment for the debts of a fugitive hu&s;band or parent; the marquis <HI>de Sanna,</HI> the count <HI>de Ribaderia,</HI> and duke of Brun&s;wick were arre&s;ted here by their di&s;tant creditors; but a &s;tranger who takes a hou&s;e, after a year and a days re&s;idence in it, is not liable to per&s;onal confinement for debt, until a tedious proce&s;s has been carried on again&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="199">An Engli&s;h gentleman of fortune having cha&s;ti&s;ed his &s;ervant too &s;everely, ab&s;conded, but his wife was hurried to the common gaol to be re&s;pon&s;ible for his town-debts till he returned; and this bu&s;ine&s;s is done in &s;o brutal a manner, that our London bailiffs are quite poli&s;hed, when compared to a pais bas officer of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I vi&s;ited, &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> their <HI>Mai&s;on de force</HI> or pri|&s;on. The men and women are &s;eparated; each pri|&s;oner has his bed and cabin, which mu&s;t be made and cleaned by an early hour, and a certain quantity of work done before they eat. In this hou&s;e, &s;ays he, I &s;aw five or &s;ix hundred of the wor&s;t people on earth, living in a cleaner and more orderly manner than the &s;ame number can live any where at large. Neither relations nor friends are admitted to &s;ee the offenders, no improper conver&s;ation is heard; prayers, work, and penitence are the lot of all. Such hou&s;es being erected in every county in our kingdom, would do more to prevent hou&s;e-breaking, than all the county gallows's in England.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to have been a mi&s;taken notion in &s;everal courts of Europe, that the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria received &s;o little benefit from the&s;e provinces, that they were &s;carce worth the keeping, the expences running away with all the profit. But admitting that no money is
<PB N="192" REF="200">
received into the trea&s;ury of Vienna, &s;till the advan|tage of having a con&s;iderable body of troops paid and maintained, is of it&s;elf very important. The pro|vinces pay the troops in garri&s;on and forces of all kinds that are quartered here, which amount at different times from &s;ix to twenty thou&s;and men; be&s;ides the opportunity of advancing a number of &s;ubjects to po&s;ts of honour and profit, is valuable to any court.</P>
<P>The&s;e provinces likewi&s;e are very populous, and are found highly &s;erviceable in recruiting regiments; and as they po&s;&s;e&s;s much trade and numerous thriving manufacturies, they are a body of &s;ubjects of un|doubted importance. However the&s;e advantages are not all, for it is very well known that large remittances are made to Vienna, notwith&s;tanding the expence of keeping a court here.</P>
<P>The upper town, &s;ays <HI>Peckham,</HI> in his de&s;cription of this city, is magnificent, and has lately been much improved by new buildings, and by inclo&s;ing a piece of water-ground, planting it and laying it out in walks.</P>
<P>It is well &s;upplied with fountains, &s;ome of which are rather whim&s;ical; for in&s;tance, the three virgins from who&s;e brea&s;ts &s;low continual &s;treams of water; and to &s;how that the male &s;ex is no le&s;s charitably in|clined,
<PB N="193" REF="201">
there is the &s;tatue of a boy who &s;pouts out water with the mo&s;t immode&s;t a&s;&s;urances. It is called in the Flemi&s;h tongue <HI>Mannykipis.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing will &s;trike the eye of an ob&s;erving &s;tranger with more &s;urprize in this city, than to &s;ee on a navi|gable river, more than a hundred miles from the ocean, &s;uch a number of large high-ma&s;ted ve&s;&s;els, of various con&s;tructions, lying before the town: the na|vigable canals and rivers throughout all the Low Countries, are indeed wonderful. Some progre&s;s of inland navigation, &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> has been &s;ucce&s;s|fully made in England; but yet the nation at large does not &s;eem to know the a&s;toni&s;hing advantages which would ari&s;e to the kingdom, if it were more general. <HI>M. de la Landes</HI> treati&s;e <HI>&s;ur le canaux de la navigation,</HI> remarks, that a waggon with &s;ix hor&s;es and two drivers, carries between two and three thou&s;and pounds weight, whereas a &s;ingle boat, navigated by two men, will carry two hundred thou&s;and pounds weight. This therefore, is a &s;aving of two hundred men, and &s;ix hundred hor&s;es, be&s;ides the extra num|ber of men and hor&s;es, which are required to repair the damages they do to the roads.</P>
<P>The public walks are elegant, the ramparts extreme|ly plea&s;ant, and the country round Bru&s;&s;els is mo&s;t delightful to the eye, and extremely profitable to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; for the land within ten miles of the city,
<PB N="194" REF="202">
&s;ells at forty years purcha&s;e, and lets in general for three pounds &s;terling an acre.</P>
<P>In the ar&s;enal is &s;ome old armour, of neither curi|o&s;ity or u&s;e; except an iron &s;hirt, which no &s;word can pierce; and a &s;teel &s;hield, &s;o finely engraved, that the figures &s;eem reflected from the poli&s;h, not to be etched in the &s;teel: the nice&s;t touch cannot perceive the lea&s;t &s;cratch; though the figures appear to be &s;trongly marked when the &s;hield is held obliquely.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t below the ar&s;enal is the palace of the governor of the Au&s;trian Netherlands. The &s;tair-ca&s;e is very magnificent, the &s;teps are of marble, and the balu&s;|trades of iron, gilt, adorned with compartments of birds and bea&s;ts, nicely executed in poli&s;hed &s;teel, by <HI>Triefle;</HI> the cieling is painted in fre&s;co.</P>
<P>The apartments of the prince&s;s are hung with Bru&s;|&s;els tape&s;try. The floors are all inlaid with mahogany and box. The prince&s;s's cabinet is much admired, being covered throughout with the fine&s;t japan. The late prince was a great mechanic, and had a cabinet of curio&s;ities trifling enough, among which were two boxes, containing all the common trades in minia|ture.</P>
<P>In the menagerie, there are &s;ome fowls, which are the produce of a very unnatural amour, between a
<PB N="195" REF="203">
rabbit and a hen; they are of various &s;izes; their brea&s;ts and bellies cloathed with white fur, their wings and backs covered with feathers, without the plume, which ri&s;e from the &s;kin, and have the appearance of wet feathers; they are all milk-white, as their pa|rents; their &s;hape in every re&s;pect the &s;ame as other fowls. The rabbit, in an amorous mood, like many other hu&s;bands, &s;trips his wife of her cloathing; by biting half the feathers from her back.</P>
<P>Having been at Bru&s;&s;els my&s;elf more than once, I can take upon me to &s;ay, that the city is by no means the fine place it is in general repre&s;ented. The &s;treets are narrow, and not well paved, having no foot|way. The hou&s;es are built in the gothic ta&s;te, with pediment tops, and the windows are chiefly ca&s;e|ments. Was it not from the fountains continually running, the place would be exceedingly dirty, and there is no appearance of &s;hops or trade. Part of the town &s;tands upon the top of a high hill, where there is a &s;mall park cut in walks, the re&s;ort of genteel people on Sundays; from this park runs &s;everal new &s;treets, with elegant hou&s;es erected in the modern &s;tile of building, commanding a fine pro&s;pect. The pa|lace is &s;mall, but very grand and neat, and &s;tands ju&s;t below the hill. Being the re&s;idence of the viceroy, and where the court is held; it is the rendezvous of all the brilliant part of Brabant, and living here is not very expen&s;ive. A man may make as genteel an
<PB N="196" REF="204">
appearance in this country, for his hundred a year, as he can in London for three times the &s;um.</P>
<P>The roads from city to city are continued pave|ments in a &s;traight line, for thirty or forty miles toge|ther, planted with trees on both &s;ides, and the country every where open and uninclo&s;ed, and there is a ca|nal from Bru&s;&s;els to Antwerp, on which a floating-barge, with good accommodation, pa&s;&s;es to and from it every day.</P>

<P>This town and di&s;trict is called the Margravate of the holy Roman empire. Its origin is &s;omewhat ob|&s;cure. <HI>Godfrey</HI> of Bouillon, enjoyed it under this ti|tle, after which it de&s;cended to the dukes of Brabant; but yet it was reckoned one of the Seventeen Provin|ces.

<P>The approach to the city of Antwerp is noble, by a &s;traight paved road, bordered with oaks.</P>
<P>This city is &s;even miles in circumference, built in the form of a cre&s;cent, and &s;urrounded with a good wall, and many ba&s;tions, faced with &s;tone. The&s;e fortifications, however, are of no other con&s;equence than to defend the town again&s;t any &s;udden incur&s;i|&s;ions, but they look very beautiful, for the top of the
<PB N="197" REF="205">
wall is an hundred feet broad, and planted with dou|ble rows of trees. Its &s;trength is in a large regular and very &s;trong citadel, in form of a pentagon, which the duke of <HI>Alva</HI> cau&s;ed to be erected there in 1568. It &s;tands clo&s;e to the river Scheld, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the city, and commands all the town and the adjacent country, for &s;ome di&s;tance. There are five principal ba&s;tions to it, which command each other, defended by two very deep ditches. Here &s;tood the &s;tatue which the duke of <HI>Alva</HI> had erected, repre&s;enting him&s;elf in a military attitude, and trampling the no|bility and people under his feet, which &s;o rou&s;ed the &s;pirit of the populace, that they broke into the cita|del on a holiday, and entirely demoli&s;hed the &s;tatue.</P>
<P>The river at Antwerp is twenty feet deep, and at high-water ri&s;es twenty feet more, which makes it an excellent harbour, &s;o that large ve&s;&s;els may come up from the &s;ea, and unload their cargoes at the eight principal canals in the town. The&s;e are the advan|tages which carried their trade to &s;uch a height; but the Dutch building Fort Lillo, which commands the approach, and makes all the &s;hips that pa&s;s pay toll, was a fatal &s;troke to their trade, and drove the chief of it to Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>Antwerp has many remains of its former magnifi|cence, particularly in the length, breadth, and regu|larity of the principal &s;treets, and many of the public-buildings
<PB N="198" REF="206">
and churches. It has twenty-two &s;quares, two hundred and twelve &s;treets, and &s;eventy gates, from each of which runs a &s;treet terminating at the ca|thedral-&s;quare. The &s;treet called La Mere, is the fine&s;t in the city, it is very well paved, and is &s;o wide, that twenty coaches may pa&s;s in it a brea&s;t, with great ea&s;e; it is al&s;o very well built, and in general of free &s;tone: many of the other &s;treets al&s;o, make a very good appearance, being broad, &s;traight and hand&s;ome. The better &s;ort of hou&s;es, throughout the city, are in general large, lofty, and contain good apartments. From the decay of trade, &s;everal of them are let at very low rates; mo&s;t of them have court-yards, and gardens, which make them very agreeable to live in, and many are in the ancient &s;tile of building, which does not make &s;o graceful an appearance.</P>
<P>The markets here are numerous, and mo&s;t of them well &s;upplied; that for fi&s;h is near the river, and abounds with great plenty, and that for fruit and gar|den-&s;tuff, is well &s;upplied by numerous country-carts, in which the pea&s;ants bring the produce of their little farms. One &s;quare is called the Friday market-place, in which, on a market-day, is to be &s;een many &s;ales by auction of furniture, and &s;ome of pictures, where are to be picked up &s;ometimes valuable pieces by Fle|mi&s;h ma&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="207">Nothing can be more melancholy, than to view the hou&s;e of the Han&s;e-towns, built in 1468, (a time in which this city was &s;o flouri&s;hing) for the u&s;e of the merchants trading to the Baltic. It is a &s;quare edifice of 230 feet, and all of &s;tone: the upper floors were ample magazines for all &s;orts of dry merchandize, with va&s;t cellars for the wet goods, which are now con|verted into &s;tabling for troopers hor&s;es, and the ma|gazines to hay-lofts; a &s;ad &s;pectacle of the building, which once was the re&s;idence of wealth and indu&s;try, and &s;hews, how mi&s;erable a fall any place undergoes, that lo&s;es a once e&s;tabli&s;hed trade.</P>
<P>Antwerp contains now about &s;eventy thou&s;and &s;ouls, of which about ten thou&s;and are on the poor|li&s;t. The police of the city, with regard to the poor, is as bad as it is &s;ingular. There is an ample fund for their maintenance, which is di&s;tributed not among tho&s;e per&s;ons, who are really indigent, but among the families of &s;uch per&s;ons as happened to, be enrolled among the poor many generations back, when it fir&s;t became an object of general police, to provide for tho&s;e who were unable to provide for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Very near the &s;treet La Mere, is the exchange, &s;aid to be the fir&s;t building of the kind rai&s;ed in Europe; and from which Sir <HI>Thomas Gre&s;ham</HI> is &s;aid to have taken his idea of that in London. This building is
<PB N="200" REF="208">
now re&s;orted to only by half a dozen bankers, and as many brokers. Four &s;treets meet there, and it has four gates an&s;werable to them; the parades are &s;up|ported by above forty marble pillars; the length of it is 180 feet, and the breadth 140. Beneath, are vaults and magazines for goods; and over it are the apartments of an academy for painting, &s;culpture and architecture. The expence of this building is &s;aid to have amounted to 300,000 crowns, at a time when money was much dearer, than it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>This city was once the grand emporium of almo&s;t all the commerce in Europe, which was owing to three principal cau&s;es. Fir&s;t, to the liberty which reigned here; &s;econdly, to the advantages of its &s;itua|tion and port; for above four thou&s;and &s;ail of &s;hips could lay in perfect &s;afety in the canals at a time: and thirdly, to the near neighbourhood of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing manufactures then in Europe, which were carried on in all the Flemi&s;h towns. Bruges po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;hare of trade before Antwerp ro&s;e to &s;uch a height; but the wars which broke out in Flanders, in the beginning of the 16th century, drove mo&s;t of the merchants from the former place to the latter. They reckoned the trade of this city at its height about the year 1568, when they computed the inhabitants at 200,000: their harbour at that time, contained very often 2500 &s;hips at a time, and 500
<PB N="201" REF="209">
were commonly &s;een to go out or come in, in a day. The annals of the city inform us, that in the year 1550, the trade amounted to one hundred and thirty-three millions of gold, exclu&s;ive of the bank. The Antwerpers, to this day, are fond of telling the &s;tory of <HI>John Daen,</HI> their famous merchant, who lent the emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. a million of gold, and afterwards entertained him mo&s;t magnificently; made a fire of cinnamon-wood, and in the emperor's pre&s;ence, threw the bond into it.</P>
<P>But all their pro&s;perity was no &s;ecurity again&s;t the tyranny of their &s;overeign, <HI>Philip</HI> II; and his arbitrary agent the duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> pre&s;ently drove all trade from Antwerp, &s;o that the fall of the city was much quicker than its ri&s;e. After being twice &s;acked, there was much of it burnt down, in 1576, and brought into &s;ucha condition, as was utterly incompatible with trade; the merchants therefore fled in whole troops, and the Dutch received them. Having formed their infant republic, Am&s;terdam began to be a place of trade; they removed thither, and carried with them their corre&s;pondence and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Upon the lo&s;s of their trade, the inhabitants gave their attention principally to banking, jewelling and painting. In the fir&s;t they have always been profi|cients, and carried it to a great extent, even in the pre&s;ent times: during the duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s
<PB N="202" REF="210">
war, two brothers, the <HI>De Konnings,</HI> paid, one of them the army of France, and the other, that of the allies. Some of their painters were of note in the Flemi&s;h &s;chool, before the time of <HI>Rubens;</HI> but that great ma&s;|ter laid the principal foundation for their fame; he e&s;tabli&s;hed their &s;chool, and painting flouri&s;hed here for a long while under the influence of his genius; &s;o that Antwerp has produced more good arti&s;ts this way, than any other town in the Netherlands. Antwerp has likewi&s;e been famous for printing the Plantin edi|tions, being much e&s;teemed in the learned world. <HI>Plantin</HI>'s printing-hou&s;e remains, though imperfect at this time, and is &s;aid by the Antwerps, to be the be&s;t in Europe, having been &s;upplied with near an hun|dred different &s;orts of founts of letters, two of which were Syriac, forty-&s;even Roman, nine Greek, and ten Hebrew.</P>
<P>But Antwerp, though &s;o much reduced from its an|cient &s;plendor, is yet a place of con&s;equence: here is &s;ome trade carried on, for which it is yet well &s;ituated, and has numerous cities in Flanders, &amp;c. to &s;upply with foreign commodities; they have al&s;o &s;everal flouri&s;hing manufactures, a con&s;iderable lace|trade, and a &s;hare of the linen fabrics, &amp;c. It is al&s;o an agreeable place to re&s;ide in, from the number of no|bility, and people of large fortune, who live in it. Through their patronage, a theatre has been rebuilt, and al&s;o an apartment for the performance of concerts.
<PB N="203" REF="211">
The fir&s;t is a very beautiful and well contrived edifice, well furni&s;hed with &s;cenery and machinery; it is richly ornamented too with paintings. A company of French comedians exhibit here three times a week in winter. Some good ma&s;ters have ornamented the concert-room, with their paintings, where a concert is performed once a week in winter.</P>
<P>In the churches there are numerous pictures of mo&s;t capital merit, by the fir&s;t painters of the Flemi&s;h-&s;chool, &s;uch as <HI>Rubens, Vandyke,</HI> and others. The great fault of the painters of the Flemi&s;h-&s;chool, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> is, that they are entirely de&s;titute of a chain of great ideas; an action, complex in its nature, but rendered one by the genius of the arti&s;t, is &s;ought for in vain, in their works, good colouring, and a ma&s;|terly imitation of &s;till-life, are their great excellen|cies; minute fini&s;hing is carried by them to the high|e&s;t perfection.</P>
<P>The cathedral of Antwerp is a va&s;t building, and full of ornaments of painting, &s;tatuary, and rich carv|ing. The taking down from the cro&s;s by <HI>Rubens,</HI> is one of the fine&s;t pictures of the kind to be met with in the whole world. It is very large, with a number of figures, all executed in the highe&s;t &s;tile of this painter, &s;o that it cannot fail of being highly admired by all lovers of painting. They are always kept ma&s;ked or covered.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="212">The fall of the angles by <HI>Floris,</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to rank, next in merit. On the thigh of one of the fallen angels, is a large hornet, painted by <HI>Quintin Matzys,</HI> the noted black&s;mith of Antwerp, who fell in love with the daughter of <HI>Floris,</HI> and demanded her in marriage; the painter refu&s;ed him, becau&s;e he was not of his own profe&s;&s;ion. <HI>Matzys,</HI> therefore changed his hammer for the pallet, and &s;tudied under the Ita|lian ma&s;ters for two years; on his return he painted this hornet, unknown to <HI>Floris,</HI> who by mi&s;take was going to bru&s;h it off, thinking it alive; he was &s;o plea&s;ed with the execution of it, that he immediately gave him his daughter in marriage; <HI>Matzys</HI> was bu|ried on the out&s;ide of the we&s;tern door of the church, where there is a plain &s;tone with this epitaph:</P>
<Q><L><HI>Conunbialis amor de Mulcibre fecit Apellum.</HI></L>
<L>Love transformed Vulcan into an Apelles.</L></Q>
<P>This building is very nobly ornamented, and its architecture in the Gothic &s;tile, is not inferior to any edifice in the Low Countries. It is five hundred feet long, and two hundred and forty feet broad. It was erected in the 13th century. The fir&s;t &s;tone of the choir was laid by the emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. Nothing can well be finer than the view &s;een from the top of this fine &s;teeple; not only a va&s;t tract of country for many miles round, but of &s;everal very con&s;iderable cities, &s;uch as Malines, Bru&s;&s;els, Ghent, Liege, Lou|vain,
<PB N="205" REF="213">
&amp;c. Here is a mu&s;ical-clock, which chimes every hour, half-hour, quarter, and half-quarter, con|&s;i&s;ting of near eighty bells. The large&s;t bell was e|rected in 1440, and weighs &s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>The abbey of <HI>St. Michael</HI> is the grande&s;t in the city, the refectory is covered with pictures by <HI>Quellin,</HI> mo&s;t admirably executed. There is a deception of a &s;tair-ca&s;e, with a fi&s;h lying on one of the &s;teps, which mu&s;t attract every eye. In the church is a grand piece by <HI>Rubens,</HI> the adoration of the Magi, which he fini&s;hed in thirteen days. The apartments of the abbot are well worthy of a prince. Such a profu&s;ion of capital pictures by the be&s;t Flemi&s;h and Italian ma&s;ters, with paintings to imitate ba&s;&s;o relievo, exe|cuted in a &s;tyle, &s;o as to deceive an arti&s;t.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits church is one of the mo&s;t beautiful edi|fices to be &s;een in all Flanders; the facade is enriched with &s;tatues and other ornaments of a great ma&s;ter; the architecture has uncommon merit; the workman&s;hip is very ma&s;terly, and it is full of fine paintings; the fine&s;t marble, intermixed with ja&s;per, porphyry, and gold; nor can any thing be more magnificent than the chapel adjoining.</P>
<P>In the library is &s;een a portrait of <HI>Rubens,</HI> drawn in pen and ink by him&s;elf, and executed in the mo&s;t in|imitable
<PB N="206" REF="214">
manner; with a minute expre&s;&s;ion, &s;o mixed with freedom, that it is beyond the power of the gra|ver to equal it.</P>
<P>The chapel of the Virgin is remarkably beautiful; it is compo&s;ed entirely of white marble, de&s;igned and executed by <HI>Scheemaeckers;</HI> and &s;urrounded with ba&s;s-reliefs. The altar is all of marble, with various deco|rations of &s;ilver, and a &s;tatue of the Virgin in that me|tal, &s;ix feet and an half high. The door of the chapel is likewi&s;e very neatly executed, and over it are three bronzes, of very fine workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the church of the friars of St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> are a holy family, a very large picture by <HI>Rubens;</HI> one of his fine&s;t pieces. St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> in a tran&s;port of de|votion by <HI>Vandyke.</HI> He is lifting up his eyes to hea|ven, where he is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ee <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> This their catalogue &s;ays, is the very be&s;t performance of that great painter; it has certainly a wonderful merit; their is a &s;trength and maje&s;ty of expre&s;&s;ion, with an elegance and freedom of de&s;ign, that is &s;eldom &s;een; the colours are cha&s;te and agreeable, &amp;c. in a word, the whole piece is &s;trikingly fine. Here is al&s;o a crucifix, by <HI>Vandyke;</HI> this picture is likewi&s;e mo&s;t capitally fine. Upon painting the above men|tioned fine picture of St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> he demanded &s;ix-hundred
<PB N="207" REF="215">
florins as his price, but the monks di&s;put|ing with him, he in&s;i&s;ted on his terms, but let them have this crucifix very cheap. It could now be &s;old for thirteen thou&s;and guineas. Such is the fate of the mo&s;t ingenious part of mankind! They can &s;carcely live by the &s;ale of their productions, but when they are dead and buried, the world begins to find out their merit, and value &s;ingle efforts of their genius, at ten times more than their whole fortune.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t church, nothing is more worthy of atten|tion than the monument of the marquis <HI>Del Pico,</HI> one of the governors of the citadel. He is repre&s;ented as &s;tarting out of his &s;leep, and in amazement at the &s;ight of two &s;keletons &s;tanding before him. Over his head are two cherubs weeping, one of which holds a &s;hield, and the other a helmet. Between them &s;tands Fame, with the arms of the marquis in one hand, and her trumpet in the other; the whole decorated with great number of military in&s;ignia. It is the work of <HI>Scheemaeckers,</HI> and one of his be&s;t performances. In the year 1746, at the &s;iege, a bomb damaged it con|con&s;iderably, but it is &s;ince repaired and very well. The altar, by the &s;ame arti&s;t, is al&s;o a magnificent piece of &s;culpture.</P>
<P>In the church of St. Andr&eacute;, there is al&s;o a curious monument erected by two Engli&s;h ladies, to the me|mory
<PB N="208" REF="216">
of that unfortunate prince&s;s <HI>Mary,</HI> queen of Scots, who fell a &s;acrifice, &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> to the jea|lou&s;y and hatred of our queen <HI>Be&s;s.</HI> This monument is of marble, with a bu&s;t of the Queen.</P>
<P><HI>Rubens,</HI> who died in the year 1640, was buried in a little chapel, which &s;till belongs to his family in the great church. His monument is of marble, and well executed; over the altar is a picture by his own hand, repre&s;enting the infant <HI>Je&s;us</HI> on the knee of the vir|gin, which is perhaps the be&s;t conceived, the be&s;t ex|ecuted, and the be&s;t pre&s;erved of all his works. St. <HI>George,</HI> and St. <HI>Jerome</HI> attended by two fine women, are near the Virgin, and the&s;e are the portraits of his two beautiful wives. This picture was engraved after his death by <HI>P. Pontius,</HI> and <HI>Rubens's</HI> intimate friend <HI>Ger|vates</HI> compo&s;ed his epitaph; which however is too contemptible to copy, nor was it placed over his re|mains till the year 1755.</P>
<P>At Bru&s;&s;els, &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> all is French; at Ant|werp, all is Dutch. Which of the two is be&s;t with re|&s;pect to the people, &s;ays he, I will not pretend to de|termine, but with re&s;pect to the laws, Antwerp bears all the credit and honour due to humanity. That barbarous and tyrannic cu&s;tom, of &s;ecretly trying cri|minals, de&s;troying their bodies, and confi&s;cating their property, in all the other provinces of the Au&s;trian Netherlands and France, does not prevail in this city.
<PB N="209" REF="217">
Perhaps this is the rea&s;on why Antwerp he adds, has produced more men of genius than any other city in this country. Here they had liberty to think, and it appears a kind of perpetual motion, was fir&s;t made at Antwerp, and in 1530, <HI>Gemma Fu&s;ius,</HI> found out a method of determining the longitude at &s;ea, by means of clocks and watches, and this very &s;oon after gave ri&s;e to the invention of clock-work.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on is to be tried for any offence in this country, he is brought face to face with his accu&s;er in open court, in the pre&s;ence of the magi&s;trates, and cri|minals are even allowed two council to plead for them. If the que&s;tion be put, the puni&s;hment mu&s;t be in the pre&s;ence of two <HI>echevins,</HI> or aldermen; and if the pri|&s;oner be acquitted, he is in&s;tantly di&s;charged: if guilty; he is executed or puni&s;hed the next day; but only a moiety of his property is forfeited; the other goes to his wife and children, or neare&s;t relations.&mdash;The be&s;t account I can give you, &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> of what is meant by the que&s;tion being put to a pri&s;oner, before it is known whether he be innocent or guilty, is that the &s;uppo&s;ed offender is fixed on a frame, to which there are certain &s;tretchers applied to his limbs, to draw them gradually beyond their natural exten&s;ion, and at the &s;ame time, drops of water are let to fall on the brea&s;t, or &s;ome particular part of the body, which by repetition became almo&s;t intolerable.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Antwerp, remarks <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> would
<PB N="210" REF="218">
have been much more advantageous for the advance|ment of commerce, but the Dutch have locked up the mouth of the Scheld. Their forts not only govern the mouth of the river, as they &s;hould do according to treaty; it having been agreed by the peace concluded at Mun&s;ter, in 1648, between Spain and the United Provinces, that no large &s;hips &s;hould &s;ail directly to Antwerp; that they &s;hould unload their merchandize in Holland, which &s;hould be conveyed thence in &s;maller ve&s;&s;els; but they have literally &s;topped up the mouth of it. Sunken &s;hips filled with &s;tones, im|men&s;e dykes of &s;tone palli&s;adoes, and other things of the kind, barely leave room enough for &s;mall boats to go by. Twenty millions of guilders would not be &s;ufficient in twenty years to remove the impediments which the Dutch have laid in the way of the trade of Antwerp. On the contrary, other writers aver, that the Scheld is navigable now for &s;hips of the large&s;t bur|then up to Antwerp; did not two forts on oppo&s;ite &s;ides of that river, oppo&s;e the pa&s;&s;age of ve&s;&s;els above a limited burthen, which is very &s;mall. A report propagated by the cunning of the Dutch, that there are five large ve&s;&s;els &s;unk in the Scheld, between their forts, has &s;trangely gained credit, not only in coun|tries at a di&s;tance from the river, but in Brabant it&s;elf, and even in Antwerp. It is amu&s;ing to reflect on the ea&s;y credulity of the world. How much people are impo&s;ed on by vague reports, and the authority of univer&s;ally received opinions! We are well a&s;&s;ured, by per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank and character in Brabant,
<PB N="211" REF="219">
that there is not one ve&s;&s;el &s;unk in the Scheld, nor any other ob&s;truction, than the treaties and forts al|ready mentioned to the pa&s;&s;age of a &s;eventy-four gun &s;hip up to the walls of Antwerp.</P>
<P>There is no want of gold in Brabant and Flanders. Antwerp, Bru&s;&s;els, Ghent, and Bruges, are &s;till filled with the trea&s;ures which were ama&s;&s;ed when the&s;e towns were what England and Holland are now. The burge&s;&s;es of the&s;e cities have a &s;hare in all the great undertakings and loans of the neighbouring nations. Their commerce of exchange is immen&s;e; probably in&s;urance is not &s;o &s;afe among the Dutch them&s;elves as it is here. Antwerp is one of the mo&s;t famous places in the world for in&s;urance. In the la&s;t Bavarian war, the court of Vienna, being determined to rai&s;e a loan in the&s;e countries, was a&s;toni&s;hed at the quick|ne&s;s with which the money was rai&s;ed; but the inha|bitants of Ghent and Antwerp gave the regency to under&s;tand, that if there was occa&s;ion for three or four times as much, it would be as ea&s;ily procured.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are religious to exce&s;s, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec.</HI> They are al&s;o remarkably gay in their dre&s;s and equi|page. The women, who are of a &s;mall &s;tature, are delicate, neat and beautiful; but, being almo&s;t ex|cluded from &s;ociety, and taught only the internal ma|nagement of their hou&s;es and their children, they are not &s;o &s;ocial as the ladies of France and England.
<PB N="212" REF="220">
They are generally of a pale complexion, a circum|&s;tance which is perhaps owing to their con&s;tant con|finement in their hou&s;es, for they never walk abroad or take any exerci&s;e, except upon Sunday evenings and public days, when they take the air in their car|riages upon the grand &s;treet called the <HI>Rue la mer,</HI> or in the environs of the city.</P>
<P>Mechlin is a con&s;iderable city, very well &s;ituated for traffic with Antwerp, Bru&s;&s;els and Louvain, by means of the rivers Dyle and Demer, which join before they arrive at this place, and run through it; there are be|&s;ides &s;everal canals, and a great many bridges thrown over them. It is the capital of a di&s;trict of the &s;ame name, and a See of an Archbi&s;hop, who&s;e title is Pri|mate of the low countries. The town is large and well built, and the &s;treets broad, clean and well paved. The market-place is &s;pacious, and the cathedral is a &s;uperb &s;tructure, with a high &s;teeple, and &s;ome very harmonious chimes. Mechlin is famous for the ma|nufacture of the lace that goes by its name. It is chiefly made in the nunnery of the Beguines; a kind of nuns, without tho&s;e vows, which bend the com|mon ones to a mona&s;tic life, being at liberty at any time to quit the confinement and marry; there are generally &s;even or eight hundred young women in it, employed on lace, which brings a good price all over Europe. They are al&s;o famous in this place for foundries of bells and great guns, and, in an inferior
<PB N="213" REF="221">
for brewing good beer, which they export in con&s;i|derable quantities. It is an agreeable place to re&s;ide at, from the diver&s;ions which are continually going on in it, principally owing to the number of nobility who make it their re&s;idence. This town was taken by the duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> in 1706, and retaken by the French in 1746.</P>
<P>At a village called Aigle, &s;eated at the foot of a moun|tain, on the Mo&s;elle, there is a remarkakle &s;quare &s;olid pyramid, 74 feet high, and adorned with many images. It is a heatheni&s;h tomb, which appears from the in&s;cription to have been founded by two brothers, named <HI>Secundini,</HI> in honor of their parents. In all probability this mau&s;oleum was created between the times of <HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great. Part of the territory of Luxemburg likewi&s;e belongs to the French.</P>

<HEAD>AUSTRIAN Part of the County of FLANDERS.</HEAD>
<P>Flanders, a province of the Netherlands, which may be divided into Dutch, Au&s;trian, and French Flanders, is bounded by the German ocean, and the United Provinces on the north; by the province of Brabant on the ea&s;t; by Hainault and Artois on the &s;outh; and by another part of Artois and the German ocean on the we&s;t. It is about twenty German miles
<PB N="214" REF="222">
from north to &s;outh, and nearly the &s;ame di&s;tance from ea&s;t to we&s;t.</P>
<P>This country enjoys a temperate and whole&s;ome air, being partly level and partly mountainous. Its &s;oil is in general fertile and fit for agriculture, and in &s;ome parts, particularly towards the &s;ea, its fertility is very great. The land here bears almo&s;t all kinds of corn and garden-&s;tuff. Flax is the riches of the country. The pa&s;ture grounds in many parts are &s;o excellent, that there are no better in all the Nether|lands. For this rea&s;on the breeding of cattle is an important article, and it yields al&s;o fine butter and chee&s;e. Flanders al&s;o produces fruits of various &s;orts, together with fowl and veni&s;on, &s;uch as deer, wild-boars and hares; and likewi&s;e &s;ea and river fi&s;h. In it al&s;o are fore&s;ts and woods. Its chief river is the Scheld. Some u&s;eful canals have al&s;o been dug here, among which that between Bruges and Ghent is the, principal one.</P>
<P>In the whole country are computed 62 walled and open towns, many hundred villages, and above 250 Seignories. The &s;tates here are the prelates, nobles, and four members from the principal towns.</P>
<P>The Flemings may boa&s;t the invention of &s;ome im|portant arts. They were the fir&s;t in Europe who be|gan to &s;upport them&s;elves by weaving, and learned
<PB N="215" REF="223">
to dye cloths and &s;tuffs. In this re&s;pect the towns of Ypres and Courtray have the olde&s;t and greate&s;t reputation. In the latter was invented the art of weaving all &s;orts of figures in linen. In the 14th century, <HI>Viervliet,</HI> found out the method of curing herrings. <HI>John Van Eyck,</HI> in the 15th, invented oil colours.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the manufactures of Flanders are far from being in the flouri&s;hing condition they were for|merly; however, we have &s;till from Li&s;le, brocades, cottons, camlets, lace, and other wares; from Ghent, Menin, and Courtray, linen; from Tournay, tape&s;|tries, curtains, bed coverlets, and other worked &s;tuffs; from Bruges, cotton and fine woolen &s;tuffs, linen and laces. The chief towns of Au&s;trian Flan|ders, be&s;ides tho&s;e de&s;cribed, are, Louvain, Ghent, Bruges, and O&s;tend.</P>
<P>Louvain is a large and plea&s;ant town, &s;ituated on the river Dyle; it is one of the principal cities of the Netherlands, and the capital of one of the four quar|ters, into which Brabant is u&s;ually divided. The country round it is very fertile, and the di&s;tance from Bru&s;&s;els not more than twelve miles to the north-ea&s;t of that city. The air likewi&s;e is e&s;teemed exceedingly healthful. Its circumference within the walls is at lea&s;t ten Engli&s;h miles; but it is a place of no great &s;trength, being of too large an extent to be ea&s;ily
<PB N="216" REF="224">
defended. The ca&s;tle &s;tands on the top of a hill, &s;urrounded with vineyards, and fine gardens, and has an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect over the neighbouring country.</P>
<P>This city, before the cruel admini&s;tration of the duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> was very con&s;iderable for its manu|factures; it being computed there were no le&s;s than 4,000 ma&s;ter-weavers in it at one time; and it has &s;till a trade in fine linen, but not comparable to what it was formerly. At pre&s;ent its only glory is its uni|ver&s;ity, which re&s;embles tho&s;e of England more than any other in Europe. It con&s;i&s;ts of 43 colleges, and &s;ome make the number greater, of which there are not more than four, for the education of youth, where &s;trict di&s;cipline is ob&s;erved; the others are for tho&s;e of riper years, who come and go when they plea&s;e. Many of the&s;e colleges are hand&s;ome buildings, and nobly endowed; but in both the&s;e re&s;pects they bear no compari&s;on with tho&s;e of Oxford and Cambridge. The &s;tudents in divinity con&s;tantly wear gowns and caps, but the re&s;t only at public exerci&s;es. In every one of the four colleges above-mentioned, philo&s;ophy is taught by two profe&s;&s;ors, each of whom reads two hours in a day, the young &s;tudents writing after them. The governor of the univer&s;ity is &s;tiled <HI>Rector,</HI> and is cho&s;en every half year by the <HI>Senatus Academicus,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;uperior graduates in the &s;everal faculties. He has plenary juri&s;diction over the &s;cho|lars,
<PB N="217" REF="225">
and is attended by eight beadles, who go before him with &s;ilver maces on holidays, and in &s;olemn pro|ce&s;&s;ions. There is another officer called the <HI>Promoter,</HI> who by the authority of the rector, inflicts puni&s;h|ment on the offenders, and &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;es &s;entence of death, but generally lays a pecuniary mulct on them in proportion to their crime. They have al&s;o a chancellor, who&s;e only bu&s;ine&s;s it is to confer de|grees, and who in all public a&s;&s;emblies takes place next to the rector.</P>
<P>The town-hou&s;e of Louvain is a magnificent build|ing of great antiquity, adorned on the out&s;ide with &s;tatues, and very curious &s;culpture. As to the churches of the city, they are many of them beau|tiful and &s;tately buildings, e&s;pecially the cathedral church of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> which is governed by a provo&s;t, a dean, a chanter, 18 honorary prebends, and ten canons, who are all profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;everal &s;ciences in the univer&s;ity. The Je&s;uit's church is al&s;o a very hand&s;ome edifice, not unworthy of Rome it&s;elf; and its pulpit of oak is reckoned the fine&s;t piece of carved work in Europe. Their library contains a great num|ber of valuable manu&s;cripts, in which re&s;pect it is &s;aid to be the be&s;t in the Au&s;trian Netherlands.</P>
<P>In this place, &s;ays, <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> re&s;ided a few years &s;ince a man, no le&s;s extraordinary in his way, than the famous mountain doctor in Switzerland, named <HI>Bo|gen,</HI>
<PB N="218" REF="226">
and called the god of legs. He was an illiterate, under-bred man, who had a no&s;trum to cure ulcers in the legs, and with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s that patients came to him from every part of the continent. But that which e&s;tabli&s;hed his fame and fortune too, be|yond contradiction, was the extraordinary cure he performed on the late Prince <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorraine's</HI> leg, after he had tried all the &s;urgeons of Paris and the low countries, without benefit, and had been for many years a perfect cripple; though he had given in pictures and &s;nuff-boxes to various &s;urgeons to the value of five thou&s;and pounds. Being &s;ent for, and on exa|mining the ulcer, he, in a very rough, unpoli&s;hed lan|guage, &s;aid to the Prince, <HI>"Zounds! what is</HI> this <HI>all? why, we will walk to-morrow!"</HI> His rude man|ner and &s;eeming ignorance had almo&s;t determined the prince to have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him in&s;tantly; for he thought it impo&s;&s;ible that a man, who had not &s;et his foot to the ground for &s;ome years, &s;hould be able to walk the next day; yet he did walk the next day, and in a very &s;hort time after was perfectly cured, and enjoyed eighteen years of life and health afterwards. Mr. <HI>Bogen</HI> is now dead; but his &s;on, whom the prince made his valet-de-chambre, is &s;till living, and is equal|ly qualified to perform the &s;ame, cures. Neither fa|ther nor &s;on pretend to any chirurgical &s;kill, farther than rolling the bandage, which is done in a mo&s;t ex|cellent and extraordinary manner. The whole &s;ecret, &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> I have good rea&s;on to believe, is no|thing
<PB N="219" REF="227">
more than &s;craped carrot, or a poultice made from that root, as what he applies is of a reddi&s;h co|lour, and &s;craped carrot alone will perform wonders in healing ulcers.</P>
<P>Ghent is one of the large&s;t cities in Europe, being near fifteen miles in circumference; &s;ome &s;ay twenty. It is built on a great number of little i&s;lands, formed by four rivers and many canals, over which there are an hundred bridges: but large and pompous as this account is, the reality bears no proportion to the de|&s;cription; more than half the ground within the walls, being occupied by gardens, and there are &s;ome fields. The fortifications are contemptible, being little more than lines for an army to encamp within. Some of the &s;treets are large, well paved, and tolerably built. Among the public buildings, there are none worthy of any attention but a few churches, except the hou&s;e in which <HI>Charles</HI> V. was born, which is &s;till to be &s;een. This place gave birth to that monarch in the year 1500. He was the &s;on of <HI>Philip</HI> the hand&s;ome, arch|duke of Au&s;tria, who&s;e parents were the emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> the only child of <HI>Charles</HI> the bold, the la&s;t prince of the hou&s;e of Burgundy. His mother was the daughter of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> king and queen of Ca&s;tile and Arragon.</P>
<P>The abbey of St. Pierre ranks far beyond any others in Ghent: it is &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground, at
<PB N="220" REF="228">
the extremity of the town, and con&s;i&s;ts of an abbot and thirty-&s;even benedictine monks. The refectory is &s;uperb, and fitter for a palace than a convent; it is paved with black and white marble, and painted throughout in a ma&s;terly manner. The library is very magnificent, and the number of books, &s;uch as they are, very con&s;iderable. From the windows you have a mo&s;t delightful, as well as an exten&s;ive view of the country. In the church is &s;ome tape&s;try held in great e&s;timation, which has been there upwards of two cen|turies. It contains the hi&s;tories of Sts. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> in divers compartments, mo&s;t admirably fini&s;hed, and was the work of <HI>Croyer,</HI> of Bru&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e, in the conver&s;ion of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> is the fine&s;t animal it is po&s;&s;ible to behold. Our Saviour &s;tanding tiptoe on a wave is the true &s;ublime, and is mo&s;t happily executed. <HI>Elymas</HI> &s;truck with blindne&s;s, has much merit; and a marble floor is as nicely imitated in the tape&s;try, as was ever &s;een in any pic|ture.</P>
<P>The abbot's hou&s;e is mo&s;t &s;umptuous; the gover|nor of the low countries always re&s;ides in it when at Ghent. The apartments are crouded with good pic|tures, but three by <HI>Rubens</HI> are mo&s;t excellent: the one is <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> with the infant <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in his arms; the two others are the heads of old men.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="229">The cathedral is a noble old building, dedicated to St. <HI>Buvon,</HI> of whom there is a good &s;tatue over the grand altar, &s;tanding on the clouds, which are &s;up|ported by angels. Again&s;t the pillars of the church are &s;ome tolerable &s;tatues, and where there are va|cancies they have painted figures in the imitation of &s;tatues &s;o happily, that it is difficult to find out the deception. The pulpit is &s;aid to be the grande&s;t of the kind; it is of marble, enriched with &s;tatues, and has two angels to &s;upport the &s;ounding board. There is a capital picture of St. <HI>Buvon,</HI> by <HI>Rubens,</HI> in which he has introduced him&s;elf, his wife and family.</P>
<P>The monument of Bi&s;hop <HI>Trie&s;te,</HI> by <HI>Fiamingo,</HI> is mo&s;t admirably executed; the boys do not yield even to tho&s;e of Cardinal Richlieu's monument at the Sorbonne. <HI>Fiamingo's</HI> principal excellence was in boys and the delicate. In this re&s;pect he was &s;upe|rior to <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> who attained the antique only in &s;trong mu&s;cular figures, not in tho&s;e of youth nor women, who under his bold hand became amazons.</P>
<P>The Mai&s;on-de-Ville has two fronts, the one in the Gothic, the other in the Grecian &s;tile, of three &s;tories, adorned with Attic, Ionic, and Corinthian columns.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome few pictures, as the Day of Judg|ment, by <HI>Rubens,</HI> and the Coronation of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. in which picture are five hundred figures, mo&s;t of
<PB N="222" REF="230">
them taken from the life. But the mo&s;t capital pic|ture is Hercules between Virtue and Plea&s;ure, taken from the fable of Cebes.</P>
<P>Before I came into this country, &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> I thought the di&s;cipline of the Briti&s;h and French troops were tolerably &s;trict; but as every, thing is by compari&s;on, &s;o I was &s;oon convinced that neither the Briti&s;h or French di&s;cipline can bear that name, when put in competition with the di&s;cipline of the German troops; and yet I am told I &s;hould find a &s;till greater difference between the&s;e troops and tho&s;e of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. The &s;oldier here wears his white coat three years, and it mu&s;t be always perfectly clean; at the expiration of which time he has a new one, and his old one is made into a wai&s;tcoat and breeches, and mu&s;t &s;erve three years more in that capacity; and is then dyed black to make gaiters. The &s;oldier is found in every article he can want for dre&s;s, even to his hair-&s;tring and powder; but his net pay is only two-pence halfpenny a day! five farthings of which is put into the common me&s;s (eight men in each) and the other five farthings are for the luxuries of life. Sheeps head broth, and hor&s;e-beans boiled in grea&s;e, are with them great delicacies. It fares better with the officers, for a captain of foot in the Imperial &s;ervice has an hundred guineas a year, a &s;ervant allowed him, and his livery furni&s;hed by the Emperor. But when an officer neglects his duty, and repeats it two or three
<PB N="223" REF="231">
times, after the commandant has hinted to him to be more attentive, he may be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame au|thority. Having a&s;ked, &s;ays <HI>Thickne&s;&s;e,</HI> what puni&s;h|ments were u&s;ed to maintain &s;o &s;trict a di&s;cipline, the an&s;wer was, <HI>none!</HI> The puni&s;hments are &s;o &s;evere that no man ri&s;ks the experiment.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;tle of Ghent there are cloathing, arms, accoutrements, &amp;c. for ten thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot, all in the mo&s;t perfect order, and all of it made with|in the ca&s;tle walls by the hands of the &s;oldiers. The German troops are in general &s;turdy, well-looking men, but they are ill-limbed, and certainly have not much more under&s;tanding among ten thou&s;and of them, than may be found among a flock of ten thou|&s;and &s;heep led about by a bell-wether.</P>
<P>They have very flouri&s;hing linen manufactures throughout all this country; but the&s;e are not con|fined to Ghent, though there are many in that town; but all the villages, and almo&s;t every farm, is a flax-manufactory. Flax is a principal crop upon all the &s;undry parts of this country, and the farmers and labourers do not only grow it, but al&s;o dre&s;s and weave it, and the women and children &s;pin it. Every little farmer has one or two looms; many of them five or &s;ix, and &s;ome &s;even or eight, according to the number of hands in the family. This makes the whole race of country people remarkably active and
<PB N="224" REF="232">
indu&s;trious; the &s;ervants and the farmer and his &s;ons will weave linen in the night, and in wet days, when they have not employment in the farm; and in this manner greatly contribute to earning a better main|tenance for their families than in other countries, where &s;uch time is appropriated to idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>The accommodations in the bark on the canal of Au&s;trian Flanders, are infinitely &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the Track&s;kuits in Holland, being con&s;iderably larger, with excellent apartments below, for three &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of pa&s;&s;engers, and a &s;haded quarter-deck with benches for them to fit on, when they chu&s;e to take the air. There is a good dinner provided for each apartment; and the company may be accommodated with wines of different kinds, tea, coffee, and Flemi&s;h beer. The price of travelling, as well as the fare, is remarkably cheap; and the be&s;t apartments are al|ways filled with good company. In fine weather no|thing can be more delightful than an excur&s;ion from Ghent to Bruges by the bark, which pa&s;&s;es from place to place in one day, di&s;tance about 30 miles, price 2s. 6d. Engli&s;h, dinner included. The variety of fine pro&s;pects, the charming verdure every where to be &s;een; the number of little chatteaus on the banks of the canal; the enlivening company that is generally to be met with, and the &s;till plea&s;ing man|ner in which die bark keeps moving forward, without any mole&s;tation from the &s;un or du&s;t in a hot &s;ultry
<PB N="225" REF="233">
day all together con&s;pire to give very plea&s;ing &s;en|&s;ations to the mind. They tell you an Engli&s;h gen|tleman was &s;o delighted with the pa&s;&s;age, the enter|tainment, and the company he met, that he lived on board this bark for &s;even years, &s;leeping one night at Ghent, the next at Bruges, and &s;o on; and, that being a facetious man, the better &s;ort of people of the&s;e two towns, particularly the young ladies, would frequently, for an excur&s;ion, go and dine, as they u&s;ed to call it, with the Engli&s;h gentleman.</P>
<P>There are a kind of &s;tage-coaches that travel all through Brabant, heavy, lumbering things, that on their paved roads almo&s;t &s;hake a man to death. The fare is cheaper than in England, and the accommodations pa&s;&s;able; but four per&s;ons may hire a coach and pair, which will travel as fa&s;t as the &s;tage, and co&s;t no more than the &s;tage price, and are far more ea&s;y to travel in. A per&s;on may go from London to Spa, and travel 200 miles through all Au&s;trian Brabant, for four gui|neas, and live well upon the road; the pa&s;&s;age in the packet from Dover to O&s;tend included, which is one guinea of the money. Tho&s;e who travel in Flanders by the canals, pay as much for the carriage of a trunk as for them&s;elves; the natives of the country take a few nece&s;&s;ary things, in a kind of &s;atchel made of carpeting called a <HI>&s;ac du nuit,</HI> which they carry in their hands when they are obliged to change boats, as is often the ca&s;e, the canals not joining each other; and by this they avoid the impo&s;itions of tho&s;e who attend the
<PB N="226" REF="234">
boats to remove the luggage. The price of travelling in the&s;e boats or barks is not more then one halfpenny Engli&s;h, per mile. They &s;et out at &s;tated hours as &s;tage-coaches do, are drawn by hor&s;es at the rate of four or five miles an hour, and will travel thirty or forty miles a-day, &s;topping at certain places to dine.</P>
<P>For fifteen-pence the treck&s;chuyt, an elegant yatch, conducts the traveller from O&s;tend to this city, which in the 13th century was the principal mart in Europe, and where the merchants of all parts of the world had hou&s;es and commerical connexions; but the frequent revolts of the inhabitants again&s;t their &s;overeigns, the manufacturers again&s;t their ma&s;ters, and the ma&s;ters again&s;t the magi&s;trates, fir&s;t drove the &s;trangers to Antwerp, and the natives to different parts of the world; the &s;ad effects of which are &s;till felt, and &s;till vi&s;ible; for Antwerp was rai&s;ed on the ruins of Bruges, as Am&s;terdam is at this day on tho&s;e of Antwerp. But &s;ince O&s;tend has become a free port, Bruges begins to revive in her trade. It is &s;aid there are two hundred and fifty &s;treets in Bruges, and 40,000 inhabitants; but more than 10,000 of them are &s;upported by public charity.</P>
<P>The police is good, the magi&s;trates being ju&s;t, but &s;evere, and there is no part of the continent where &s;trangers or natives can travel more &s;ecurely. At Bruges an advocate is paid twenty-eight pence an hour
<PB N="227" REF="235">
for attendance, but the phy&s;ician has only &s;even-pence for each vi&s;it. When a con&s;ultation is held, each phy&s;ician has twenty-&s;ix pence, and the &s;urgeons half that &s;um.</P>
<P>In one of the churches at Ghent, there is a ring of bells, the large&s;t of which weighs 110 quintals, each quintal, a hundred pounds. There are two or three fine open places in this city, and a good theatre; but the hou&s;es, as at Bru&s;&s;els and Bruges, are all old-fa&s;hioned and built in the Gothic &s;tyle.</P>
<P>Bruges is an ancient and exten&s;ive city, walled in, the circumference being near five miles. It has near three hundred &s;treets in it, and a va&s;t number of canals and rivers; but notwith&s;tanding all this &s;paci|ou&s;ne&s;s, it is not an agreeable place. The hou&s;es are in general very old and extremely ugly, and the whole place &s;hews evident &s;igns of decay, and a lo&s;s of that trade and manufacture for which it was once famous. They reckon &s;ix &s;quares, &s;even gates, eight churches, and no le&s;s than &s;ixty mona&s;teries; a woeful &s;ort of population, in&s;tead of the indu&s;trious manufacturers, which once filled the city: among the re&s;t, there is a nunnery of Engli&s;h, which &s;everal Roman Catholic families in England have contributed to fill.</P>
<P>The churches of Bruges have not any thing in them remarkable; the be&s;t is the Je&s;uits, which is an elegant
<PB N="228" REF="236">
edifice. In the church of our Lady, there are two fine monuments of <HI>Charles</HI> the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, and his daughter and heire&s;s, <HI>Mary</HI> of Burgundy; they are of bra&s;s, with much enamelling; the workman&s;hip good. Her dre&s;s is likewi&s;e &s;hewn, that &s;he wore three hundred years ago, and which is highly enriched with jewels.</P>
<P>What gives this place a very melancholy air, are the va&s;t hou&s;es &s;tanding empty in every part of the town, which once were the re&s;idence of wealth and &s;plendour. Among others they have &s;eventeen palaces, which, in the times of their pro&s;perity, were formerly the re&s;idence of con&s;uls from various kingdoms and &s;tates in Europe. This town was famous for trade, before Antwerp aro&s;e, being then the greate&s;t mart in Europe; England made it the &s;taple for her wool; and its cloth manufactories were much more con&s;ider|able, than tho&s;e of any other place or country. Bruges however at pre&s;ent is not without &s;ome trade. The O&s;tend canal admits &s;hips of from 2 to 300 tons burthen, up to the heart of the city, which excites more trade here than in any other town in Flanders.</P>
<P>The merchandize imported by the &s;hipping on this canal, is &s;ent to many places from Bruges, particularly by the Scheld to the city of Ghent, and from thence by other canals to various cities; and that river with the Scarpe and the Lys, reaches to Tournay, Menin,
<PB N="229" REF="237">
Li&s;le and Douay: they have likewi&s;e a communication with Antwerp, Louvain, Mechlin, and Bru&s;&s;els. It is an epi&s;copal town. In the great &s;quare there is a hou&s;e founded in 1411, where they provide for 130 orphans, and bring them up, &s;ome to learning, and others to trades, according to their abilities. This city has often been taken and retaken in the late wars, particularly in 1745, by the French.</P>
<P>O&s;tend is the only &s;ea-port of Au&s;trian Flanders. It is &s;mall, but well built and clean, nor does it ex|hibit &s;o much decay of ancient greatne&s;s as Bruges. It is &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of a &s;alt-mar&s;h, with ditches into which the &s;ea is let; this &s;ituation makes it &s;trong, but the improvements in the modern art of attacking places will not allow it the &s;ame of &s;uch another &s;iege as that which it &s;tood again&s;t the Spaniards, which la&s;ted three years, and in which above 100,000 men on both &s;ides fell. The French, in 1745, took it in eight days. In the furious &s;iege above-mentioned which la&s;ted from 1601 to 1604, and in which the Dutch lo&s;t 50,000 men, and the Spaniards 80,000, <HI>I&s;abella Eugenia,</HI> governante of the Netherlands, made a vow &s;he would not change her linen till O&s;tend &s;urrendered; but before the town was taken, the colour of it was quite changed. However the ladies of the court, to keep her in countenance, had theirs dyed, &s;o as to be in colour like that of their mi&s;tre&s;s. By the late Emperor's having made it a free port, the
<PB N="230" REF="238">
trade of it has been very much increa&s;ed. The e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of an Ea&s;t-India Company here, by the Emperor, has al&s;o contributed not a little to render it famous. The maritime powers endeavoured to frighten him out of this e&s;tabli&s;hment; and it is &s;ome|what extraordinary how the&s;e powers could have had the mode&s;ty to pu&s;h this matter in the manner they did; for why the Emperor &s;hould not have the liberty to form what e&s;tabli&s;hments he plea&s;ed in a &s;ea-port in his own dominions, is much more than any of the Engli&s;h or Dutch memorials could give a &s;atisfactory reply to.</P>
<P>It is e&s;timated that the Engli&s;h &s;mugglers alone bring to the amount of 600,000 livres monthly into this town; they bring too, ready money, and therefore the O&s;tenders are content with &s;mall profits, for their brandy, tobacco, tea, gauzes, laces, wine, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This town is now inhabited by men of all nations, where as much Engli&s;h is heard as French or Flemi&s;h; &s;urrounded with the &s;ea, they have no good water; the harbour however is crouded with &s;hipping, which &s;hews it to be a place of great trade.</P>

<HEAD>THE COUNTY OF NAMUR,</HEAD>
<P>Is nearly &s;urrounded by the Bi&s;hopric of Liege and the Duchy of Brabant. Its extent from north to &s;outh is about &s;ix German miles, and nearly as much from
<PB N="231" REF="239">
ea&s;t to we&s;t. This country is very mountainous and woody. Its principal riches con&s;i&s;ts in iron, which is here prepared into &s;teel and worked up in great quantities. In the level country is a great deal of corn land. The Meu&s;e, which runs through the country, and receives into it the Sambre at Namur, tends much to the fertility of the &s;oil, and to the ad|vantage of the country in general from its navigation.</P>
<P>Namur, the capital of the country, is a large and rich town, &s;eated between two mountains, with a &s;trong ca&s;tle, &s;everal forts, and a bi&s;hop's &s;ee. This city was be&s;ieged by King William in 1695, who took it in the &s;ight of an army of 100,000 French, though there was 60,000 men in garri&s;on.</P>
<P>The Flemings, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> are the mo&s;t extraordi|nary compound of &s;lothfulne&s;s and indu&s;try, &s;tupidity and acutene&s;s, activity and cowardline&s;s, goodne&s;s of heart and treachery, that can be well conceived. An Engli&s;hman once &s;aid of them, "They have the im|pudence of the French, without their plea&s;antry; the pride and bigotry of the Spaniards, without their &s;en&s;e of honour; the ferocity and har&s;hne&s;s of the Dutch, without their punctuality; the debauchery of the Germans, without their integrity; and as to their bodies, they are blocks, from which the carver at|tempted to make Engli&s;hmen, but could not cut them out." The picture is in general ju&s;t, as the&s;e inhabi|tants of the Netherlands are an a&s;&s;emblage of all the&s;e
<PB N="232" REF="240">
nations. But what they are mo&s;t con&s;picuous for, is want of honour. You mu&s;t have agreements in writing in all the common tran&s;actions of life. You are in danger of fir&s;t being overcharged, and then carried into a court of ju&s;tice by every workman of whom you be&s;peak a piece of work, if you do not put down your agreement in black and white.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their bodies, they and the Saxons are mo&s;t like the Germans, de&s;cribed by <HI>Tacitus:</HI> their bodies are of a very unwieldy make, and <HI>ad impetum valida,</HI> what too <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;ays of the old Ger|mans, that they can bear neither hunger nor thir&s;t, nor heat, nor cold, nor yet any long work, is true of them. In the Imperial armies they are accounted good parti&s;ans, but are never put to regular &s;ervice without extreme nece&s;&s;ity. They have a great abhor|rence of di&s;cipline, and look upon it as a &s;evere puni&s;hment to be &s;ubject to the rules of &s;ervice. If their robberies and maraudings are not overlooked, they will not la&s;t out a campaign. In &s;hort, it is only in action that they &s;hew them&s;elves at all as &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Except Spain, Italy, and Portugal, there is no country &s;o overloaded with monks as the Au&s;trian Netherlands: there are in many towns forty or fifty convents; &s;eve|ral prelatures are worth 200,000 guilders, (2000l.) a|year. If you divide the income of the country into four parts, one will be found to belong to the prie&s;t|hood,
<PB N="233" REF="241">
one to the nobility, one to the &s;overeign, and one to the people. The bigotry and intolerance of the inhabitants are beyond all de&s;cription, and is a marvel|lous contra&s;t to the corruption of their manners.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting their manufactures, they have not a &s;ingle one comparable to what they were formerly: that of lace is flouri&s;hing, but not near &s;o con&s;iderable as formerly; and the &s;ame ob&s;ervation is applicable to tho&s;e of fine linen and tape&s;try: indeed, the attention given to manufacturers in every country of Europe, cannot but have drawn much from the old fabric long e&s;tabli&s;hed; no article of manufacture is found in Flanders which is not &s;trongly rivalled by &s;ome neigh|bour or other. This, with the internal mi&s;chiefs, re|&s;ulting from freedoms of corporate towns cramping the workmen, is very prejudicial to all indu&s;try in the&s;e provinces.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e impediments, the fabrics of Au&s;trian provinces are by no means incon&s;iderable; the towns are thick, and all of them have &s;ome manu|facture or other: their linens, laces, &s;tockings, caps, cloth, druggets, carpets, &amp;c. are all con&s;iderable; employing great numbers of hands, and bringing much money into the country.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the pea&s;ants of this country is like that of French Flanders; and what we &s;o often &s;ee in
<PB N="234" REF="242">
the pictures of <HI>Teniers.</HI> The women wear a kind of French night-cap, with a plaited border, gold ear-rings, a gold cro&s;s hanging from their neck, a jacket and petticoat, the petticoat &s;hort, the jacket laced before, and &s;lippers. Some wear a black bib and &s;hort black apron. They never wear a hat, but when abroad throw over their heads about four yards of black &s;tuff like a veil. The better cla&s;s of women wear camblet hoods abroad, and long cloaks of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The man's dre&s;s is better de&s;cribed by the plate&mdash;where a young man has conducted his &s;weetheart to the hou&s;e of a village-doctor for a remedy, &s;he having complained of being ill. As this man looked into the cau&s;e of complaints by the urine of his patients, &s;he took a bottle of her urine with her, little con|ceived that on examining it he would have di&s;covered that &s;he was with child; and which &s;he would never had her lover, the la&s;t man in the world, to have been made acquainted with.</P>
<P>Having now gone through the different circles of Germany, and &s;poke of every material place as fully as our reader, we tru&s;t, will think nece&s;&s;ary, we will pro|ceed to a de&s;cription of the United Provinces, fir&s;t recapitulating and making &s;ome general remarks on the whole of Germany together.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Review of Germany.</HEAD>
<P>THE Germans are in general tall, robu&s;t, and well made; of a fair complexion, and regular features. Their women in particular are very hand&s;ome, and excel tho&s;e of mo&s;t other countries. They never u&s;e paint, or foreign ornaments, to embelli&s;h their per|&s;ons. Their apparel is exceedingly mode&s;t, but very rich, and they are &s;aid to be remarkably fond of jewels; they are more ob&s;equious to their hu&s;bands than tho&s;e of other nations, many of them not even &s;itting at table with them, and none of them taking the upper hand of them. They are al&s;o for the mo&s;t part well educated, and extremely fond of mu&s;ic; but not very talkative.</P>
<P>The people of Germany have a degree of &s;uper&s;ti|tion among them, beyond that of other nations, that will &s;ometimes lead them into the mo&s;t de&s;perate acts. The following from <HI>Chi&s;ul,</HI> is one of the many &s;tories that could be brought to evince this truth. He was at Vienna about forty years &s;ince, and had the oppor|tunity of &s;eeing the decollation of a woman, who&s;e head the executioner &s;truck off at one blow, as &s;he &s;at in a chair, levelled again&s;t the back part of her neck with a two-handed &s;troke and a broad two-edged
<PB N="236" REF="245">
&s;word. At the&s;e executions there a&s;&s;i&s;t, as in Italy, about twenty per&s;ons of an order called the Confra|ternity of the Dead, habited in black with ma&s;ks, broad hemmed hats and mourning &s;taves. They are a fixed &s;ociety, compo&s;ed of citizens of the middle rank, on whom their confe&s;&s;ion impo&s;e it as a piece of penance to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>incognito</HI> on the&s;e occa&s;ions. But mo&s;t re|markable was the fact and behaviour of the criminal, who was about twenty-&s;ix years old, and in the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band, then three years impri&s;oned at Pre&s;|burg, had admitted the embraces of a young man whom &s;he pa&s;&s;ionately loved, but at la&s;t di&s;covered was going to be married to another woman. After the mo&s;t earne&s;t, but fruitle&s;s endeavours to di&s;|&s;uade him from his purpo&s;e, &s;he invited him to walk with her one morning beyond the <HI>Favorita,</HI> where, in a bye place, &s;he enticed him to ki&s;s her, and at that moment took her opportunity, and &s;hot him in the head. This done &s;he immediately re&s;igned her&s;elf to ju&s;tice, revealed the whole fact, and implored her &s;peedy di&s;patch, that &s;o &s;he might have his company in the other world, without whom &s;he could not live in this. She walked with a fre&s;h and undaunted countenance to the place of &s;entence, which, though before de&s;igned and notified accordingly, is never formally pronounced till the time of execution. From thence &s;he returned to the place of her death, &s;at down in the chair, and received the &s;troke without ever moving her body, changing her countenance, or dreading the blow &s;he
<PB N="237" REF="246">
was to feel.&mdash;At the&s;e executions they often catch the blood of the criminal, as good again&s;t the falling &s;ick|ne&s;s. It is from &s;imilar &s;uper&s;titions, that the people &s;o frequently murder infants at Hamburg, in order to procure a capital puni&s;hment, tired of their lives, and dreading the idea of &s;elf-murder.</P>
<P>Though the Germans in general are of large &s;tature, yet it has been ob&s;erved their &s;pirit is not equal to their bulk. They are generally very good-natured, and free from malice and &s;ubtlety. The pea&s;ants are laborious, &s;incere, hone&s;t, and ho&s;pitable; as are like|wi&s;e the merchants and trade&s;men, who are withal very complai&s;ant.</P>
<P>Ho&s;pitality is a peculiar characteri&s;tic of the Ger|mans; and it is a virtue they derive from their an|ce&s;tors; for <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> informs us, that in his time their hou&s;es were open to all men; that they thought it an inju&s;tice to affront a traveller, and even looked upon it as a piece of religion to protect tho&s;e who came under their roof. A &s;ingle letter of recom|mendation is &s;ufficient to procure a per&s;on an agree|able reception among them, which can hardly be &s;aid of the inhabitants of any other country. Their civility extends &s;o far as to introduce a &s;tranger directly into their &s;ocieties or a&s;&s;emblies. They are remarkable al&s;o for their bravery, and love of military glory, in which they rival, if not &s;urpa&s;s, mo&s;t other nations.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="247">The Germans are frequently repre&s;ented as dull and heavy; but tho&s;e who characterize them thus, have &s;eldom any knowledge of them, but what they borrow from the French, who hardly ever allow wit or &s;en&s;e in any other nation than their own. To judge of their intellects by their improvements in mechanic arts, we &s;hould never charge a people with heavine&s;s and &s;tupidity to whom we are indebted for &s;o many u&s;eful and valuable di&s;coveries. They have not indeed the &s;ame vivacity, but they &s;urpa&s;s the French in applica|tion and judgment. Upon the re&s;toration of learning they di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves early in the different branches of literature.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t reformers, <HI>Luther, Melanchthon, Camera|rius,</HI> and others, were mo&s;t of them men of eminent erudition. Few other nations &s;urpa&s;s either their men of letters, or even their mechanics, in application. This made an Italian &s;ay, by way of joke, expre&s;&s;ive of their a&s;&s;iduity, "That the under&s;tanding of a German was not in his brain, but in his back." Print|ing is encouraged here to a fault, no per&s;on being ad|mitted to any degree in their univer&s;ities, who has not publi&s;hed at lea&s;t one di&s;putation.</P>
<P>In regard to baths and mineral fountains, it is a que&s;tion if there are &s;o many in all Europe as in Germany. They reckon above a thou&s;and &s;prings of acid waters alone, &s;ome hot, &s;ome cold, and others that are both hot and cold at different times.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="248">Germany is likewi&s;e famous for that &s;ort of earth called <HI>terra &s;igillata.</HI> It is a kind of hard earth, with white, yellow, and red veins, and &s;aid to be an antidote again&s;t all &s;orts of poi&s;ons.</P>
<P>Travelling is cheaper in Germany than in mo&s;t parts of Europe, but the accommodations on the roads between the great towns, are very indifferent, both with re&s;pect to diet and lodging. In the hou&s;es we &s;eldom &s;ee a fire, except in their kitchens, their rooms being heated by &s;toves. One thing is very peculiar in their bed-furniture, they u&s;e no blankets nor quilts; but lay one featherbed ca&s;ed in linen like a pillow, and another underneath covered with a &s;heet, be|tween the&s;e two, the Germans &s;leep. Travelling in many parts of Germany, particularly where the roads are &s;andy, is very tedious, the po&s;tilions not going above three Engli&s;h miles an hour. It is u&s;ual for tho&s;e per&s;ons who travel po&s;t through Germany, and have no carriage of their own, to purcha&s;e one for that purpo&s;e, which may generally be met with in any of the frontier towns on very ea&s;y terms; as the carriages at the po&s;t hou&s;es in Germany, and which the po&s;t-ma&s;|ters are obliged to furni&s;h, if required, have frequently no covering to them. They are in every re&s;pect like an Engli&s;h waggon, built on a &s;mall &s;cale to hold about &s;ix per&s;ons. The covered carriages occa&s;ionally to be found at the po&s;t-hou&s;es, and tho&s;e purcha&s;ed by common travellers, are like our old-fa&s;hioned phaetons.
<PB N="240" REF="249">
The ordinary po&s;t-waggon, which an&s;wers to our &s;tage-coach, travels night and day for days together. It goes between forty and fifty Engli&s;h miles in four-and-twenty hours, and is in appearance like an Engli&s;h narrow-wheeled waggon, only &s;omething lighter. For|merly none of them had coverings, at pre&s;ent mo&s;t of them have, but not all.</P>
<P>Germany, including Sile&s;ia, is &s;omething larger than France. It contains about twelve thou&s;and &s;quare miles. The &s;oil varies very much in different parts. A great part of it however is very highly cultivated. The immen&s;e ma&s;&s;es of rocks in the &s;outhern parts of Au&s;tria and Bavaria, and the &s;ands of the north, which take in nearly the whole of Lower Saxony, with Bran|denburg, Pomerania, and the north of We&s;tphalia, are not capable of &s;uch a high degree of cultivation as the upper parts of Germany; but this would be a great advantage, if the intere&s;ts and welfare of the whole were common. The mountains in the &s;outh contain metals of all kinds in prodigious quantities, and the &s;ands in the northern parts produce hemp, flax, and wool, with excellent timber in abundance for the building of &s;hips.</P>
<P>Bohemia, Moravia, Sile&s;ia, Au&s;tria, Bavaria, and the countries about the Rhine, the Au&s;trian Nether|lands, and part of Upper Saxony, furni&s;h corn, cattle, wine, and all the prime nece&s;&s;aries of life, in &s;uch
<PB N="241" REF="250">
quantities as are not only &s;ufficient to &s;upply Germany, but even for exportation.&mdash;In &s;hort, Germany is the only country that is independent of all the world, and &s;upplied with all the nece&s;&s;aries and convenience of life, which a large and flouri&s;hing &s;tate requires, for its &s;upport, or &s;tands in need of for its defence. France, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> is deficient of wood and cattle, particularly hor&s;es, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary metals and linen; and Ru&s;&s;ia is obliged to import wine, wood, hor&s;es, and various other articles; but Germany has every thing which the&s;e two very powerful countries produce, and a &s;uperfluity be&s;ides of what they &s;tand in need.</P>
<P>It is difficult to e&s;timate the population of Ger|many. Some countries, as for in&s;tance Upper Au&s;tria, have 2000 &s;ouls in every &s;quare mile, Magdeburg, Minden, Brun&s;wick, and many others, have 2500. On the contrary, the Hanoverian dominions, Bran|denburg, Pomerania, and Mecklenburg, with many others, have not more than 1000 inhabitants on every &s;quare mile. Reckoning therefore 1700 inhabitants on an average for every &s;quare mile, will give twenty-five millions for the whole country, which is nearly the number they are e&s;timated by the late King of Pru&s;&s;ia in his Treati&s;e of German Literature; and which, &s;ays <HI>Rei&s;bec,</HI> &s;eems to come neare&s;t the truth. The manife&s;to which the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia pre&s;ented to the court of Vienna, on account of the la&s;t di&s;turb|ances about Bavaria, contains the&s;e remarkable words, "It is the intere&s;t of all the powers of Europe to take
<PB N="242" REF="251">
care that the balance of Germany be not di&s;turbed; for if it &s;hould be, its internal &s;trength and &s;ituation may enable it to de&s;troy the peace of Europe."</P>
<P>This exten&s;ive country has not as yet acquired the degree of cultivation of which it is capable. It is not even &s;o highly cultivated as France. The peace of Hubert&s;burger is its aera of cultivation. Since that period agriculture and indu&s;try have been univer&s;al. It at once exerted all its &s;trength to fill up the gaps which had been made by the de&s;tructive war of thirty years. The very partition of the country into &s;o many different &s;tates, prejudicial as it is to the exertion of power for the purpo&s;e of foreign conque&s;ts, has been of advantage to its internal cultivation. At pre&s;ent the fir&s;t princes in Germany contend with each other who &s;hall make the greate&s;t improvements in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in the &s;y&s;tem of edu|cation, and in their general police for the promotion of agriculture and commerce, with as much eagerne&s;s as they formerly contended for a rival&s;hip in pomp and external magnificence. In no country is there now &s;o thorough a conviction of a value of men, and of their different occupations, and how to improve them to the utmo&s;t advantage, as in Germany.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to legi&s;lation, and the true intere&s;t of a country, there has been a benevolent light &s;pread in mo&s;t parts of this empire, which not only points out their deficiencies, but encourages the princes and their
<PB N="243" REF="252">
&s;ervants to fill them up. Without doubt Germany as well as the re&s;t of Europe is much indebted to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, the fir&s;t practical philo&s;opher in modern times, who has been &s;een on a throne. It was this prince who began the glorious revolution, which has made &s;uch changes in Germany during the la&s;t twenty years; he taught his neighbours that the intere&s;ts of princes and their &s;ubjects were the &s;ame; he began to take off the veil which was thrown over admini&s;tra|tion: finally, he &s;ubdued the tyrants among the nobi|lity and prie&s;ts, who fattened on the &s;ub&s;tance of the citizen and pea&s;ant. Military as his government may appear to &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers, it is to that alone Ger|many is &s;o indebted for a peace of five-and-twenty years, which &s;he had not known for many centuries be|fore, and in the cour&s;e of which &s;he fir&s;t began to feel what &s;he really was.</P>
<P>The peculiar turn of the Germans &s;eems to be phi|lo&s;ophy; they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the nations of Europe for cool and ju&s;t judgments, united with ex|treme indu&s;try; they were the fir&s;t who threw a light on mathematics and general phy&s;ics; they next darted through theology, hi&s;tory, and finally legi&s;la|tion with the &s;ame philo&s;ophic &s;pirit. The prize of wit they will do well to leave to other nations, for which they will ever contend in vain.</P>
<P>If Germany could make it&s;elf one great people; if it was united under one governor, if the pre&s;ent in|tere&s;ts
<PB N="244" REF="253">
of a &s;ingle prince were not often in oppo&s;ition to the general welfare of the whole; if all the members of the empire were &s;o well compacted into one body, that the &s;uperfluous &s;ap of the one could circulate and invigorate all the re&s;t, how much greater &s;teps towards cultivation might not the country then make! But Germany would then give laws to all Europe. How powerful are the two hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Branden|burg, even as things now are? the greatne&s;s of who&s;e &s;trength con&s;i&s;ts in their German po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and yet who do not po&s;&s;e&s;s half or even the be&s;t parts of this country. Though the character of the Germans be not &s;o brilliant as that of other nations, &s;till it is not de&s;titute of its peculiar excellencies. The German is a man of the world. He lives under every &s;ky, and conquers every natural ob&s;tacle to his happine&s;s. His indu&s;try is inexhau&s;tible. Poland, Hungary, Ru&s;&s;ia, the Engli&s;h and Dutch colonies, are much indebted to German emigrants. Even the fir&s;t &s;tates in Europe owe great part of their knowledge to Germany. Rec|titude is al&s;o an almo&s;t univer&s;al characteri&s;tic of the people of this country; neither are the manners of the inhabitants in the le&s;&s;er cities, by any means &s;o cor|rupt as tho&s;e of France and other countries: it is ow|ing to this circum&s;tance, that the country is &s;o well peopled, notwith&s;tanding the great emigrations. In &s;hort, frugality on the part of the Prote&s;tants and frank|ne&s;s on that of the Catholics, are grand, brilliant and natural characteri&s;tics.</P>

<P>THE United Netherlands are bounded by the German ocean on the north, by We&s;tphalia on the ea&s;t, by Au&s;trian Brabant on the &s;outh, and by the Engli&s;h channel towards the we&s;t. The&s;e provinces are &s;even in number; Holland, Zealand, Utrecht, Guel|derland, Overy&s;&s;el, Groningen, and Friezland. The name of the Netherlands, which included the Dutch, Au&s;trian, and French, in all appearance takes its ri&s;e from the &s;ittuation of the&s;e countries, as con&s;idered with re&s;pect to Germany, and implies the Nether or Lower Germany. The whole of the Seven United Provinces includes about 625 &s;quare geographical miles. The air is moi&s;t and unhealthy. The winter

&s;ets in about October, and even in the month of May there is often &s;carce any appearance of &s;pring. In &s;ummer the heats are often more exce&s;&s;ive than in the &s;outh of France, or even in Italy. Sometimes the extremes of heat and cold are even felt in the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>Here are all manner of tame fowl, as in England; and of the wild &s;ort, the &s;tork about the bigne&s;s of a heron is the mo&s;t remarkable. This bird builds his ne&s;t on the top of their chimnies in mo&s;t of the towns and villages, and through a national &s;uper&s;tition is never de&s;troyed. They take their flight with their young ones, about the middle of Augu&s;t, and as is con|jectured retire into Africa, or &s;ome other warm coun|try, and return in February. There are prodigious quantities of wild gee&s;e, herons, ducks, and other water-fowl, which cover the mar&s;hes of the Low Coun|tries every winter; they have likewi&s;e plenty of par|tridges, &s;nipes, quails, pigeons, hares and rabbits, but none of tho&s;e wild bea&s;ts which abound in the Ger|man fore&s;t, &s;uch as bears, wild boars, and wolves; foxes they have in great numbers. Their &s;eas, lakes, canals, and rivers abound in fi&s;h of all kinds, except oy&s;ters, of which there are very few.</P>
<P>The whole country is full of mora&s;&s;es, which how|ever are not without their advantages, yielding good turf for fuel, and in &s;ome parts they are reckoned &s;o
<PB N="247" REF="257">
&s;ecure a defence for the &s;tate on the &s;ide of Germany, that the draining of them is prohibited by law.</P>
<P>The&s;e mora&s;&s;es however joined with the low &s;itua|tion of the country near the &s;ea, occa&s;ion fogs and frequent rains, which are more particularly brought on by the we&s;terly winds that prevail in the&s;e parts with great violence. The general di&s;tempers of the inhabitants are the gout and &s;curvy. Colds and rheu|mati&s;ms are al&s;o very common; and in the fenny parts near the &s;ea, where the mud during the ebb emits putrid effluvia, continual vomitings are very frequent. It is the dampne&s;s of the climate that accu&s;toms the inhabitants to &s;moaking; for both men and women of a certain age, are &s;eldom &s;een without their pipes and &s;pitting pots.</P>
<P>The land is for the mo&s;t part level, and in many places lyes even lower than the &s;ea; for which rea&s;on it is not only fenced again&s;t its inundations by dykes and dams at a prodigious expence; but likewi&s;e for draining the water from the fenny parts, there have been innumerable ditches cut, from which the water &s;o drained is conveyed by windmills into canals, and from thence by means of &s;luices into the rivers. The&s;e dykes and canals give the country a very &s;ingular ap|pearance, and being planted with rows of trees, willow and others, inter&s;per&s;ed with gardens and plea&s;ant hou&s;es, make it very convenient as well as delightful to tra|vellers.

The barks which are drawn by hor&s;es, &s;et out every day in &s;ummer at certain hours, to go from one place to another. As a great part of the country con|&s;i&s;ts of heath and &s;ands, it does not afford a &s;ufficient &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the inhabitants; nor can all the indu&s;|try of agriculture draw from it as much grain as is nece&s;&s;ary for home con&s;umption. But this again is amply compen&s;ated by its re&s;ources of trade and navi|gation, which enable the Dutch not only to brew good beer, and di&s;til brandy from the corn they im|port, but likewi&s;e to export great quantities afterwards of both. On the other hand, the rich meadows and pa&s;tures make grazing very profitable, by which the inhabitants are &s;upplied with milk, butter and chee&s;e, and the exports of the two latter amount to very large &s;ums; the Texel chee&s;es being famous all over the world. In Holland, too, the breeding of &s;heep is very con&s;iderable, and admits of further improvements, as under proper regulations a million of &s;heep might be fed in that province. The wool of the&s;e &s;heep is al&s;o reckoned very fine. Several places likewi&s;e yield tobacco, and Zealand is famous for its madder. Culi|nary plants the&s;e provinces have in abundance, and in &s;ome parts of them there is great plenty of fruit. The principal fuel is turf and pit-coal, the latter of which comes from England. Wood being very &s;carce and dear, there is but little of it u&s;ed. Every piece of timber worked up in the&s;e countries, whether for building or for exportation, is brought from abroad.

In many places they boil &s;alt from the &s;ea water. The country of Zutphen yields iron. In &s;hort, nature affords &s;o little that is valuable here, that the inhabi|tants owe both the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life to their exten&s;ive commerce with foreign countries.</P>
<P>The principal rivers are the Rhine, the Meu&s;e, and the Scheldt. The fir&s;t of the&s;e ri&s;es in Germany, and taking its cour&s;e through the Duchy of Cleves, enters the Netherlands at Fort Schenk; there it divides into two branches; the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which, after pa&s;&s;ing by Nimeguen, runs into the Meu&s;e; the other branch, after again &s;ubdividing into &s;maller branches, lo&s;es it&s;elf in the canals, and in one or two le&s;&s;er rivers.</P>
<P>The Mae&s;e forms the boundary between Geulder|land and Brabant. Oppo&s;ite to Dort this river divides into two branches; one branch runs by Rotterdam, and the other takes a different cour&s;e; they afterwards meet again; and this river, which is very wide at its mouth, then di&s;charges it&s;elf in the ocean at Brill. On this river, which ri&s;es in Burgundy, and runs through the principality of Liege, there was formerly a very con&s;iderable traffic; but the &s;everal &s;overeigns through who&s;e dominions it takes its cour&s;e, having laid heavy tolls on all ve&s;&s;els as they pa&s;&s;ed through their territories, this trade is now very much on the decline.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="260">The fi&s;hery in the &s;everal &s;treams, rivers and lakes, though very con&s;iderable, &s;erves only for home con|&s;umption; but that of the North-Sea is very produc|tive; it is divided into the greater and the le&s;&s;er. By the former is to be under&s;tood that carried on along the coa&s;ts, e&s;pecially on the Dogger&s;and or Dogger&s;|bank, between England and Jutland, on which there are caught cod, haddock, turbots, whitings, &s;oles, and other &s;ea fi&s;h. The cod caught here is either carried fre&s;h and alive to market, or el&s;e is &s;alted up at &s;ea, and thus forms a branch both of foreign and dome&s;tic commerce. The great fi&s;hery is that of herrings, from which the Dutch reap immen&s;e profits: for if it may not as formerly be termed the golden mine of Holland, yet it &s;till yields a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to at lea&s;t 30,000 families. The &s;ea&s;on for catching the herrings along the coa&s;t of England and Scotland, is from the 24th of June to the 25th of November. The ve&s;&s;els employed in this fi&s;hery, are called bu&s;&s;es, and carry from twenty-five to thirty la&s;ts, each la&s;t is 80 bu&s;hels, which one with another &s;ell for about one hundred and twenty guilders. Some years back no le&s;s than fifteen hundred &s;uch ve&s;&s;els have been known to &s;ail from the ports of Holland; whereas at pre&s;ent the number &s;eldom exceeds two hundred. Though the e&s;timates of the profits ari&s;ing from the herring-fi&s;hery differ, as the profits them&s;elves do in different years, yet it is computed in a good year, that the neat gain to the proprietors of the bu&s;&s;es, amounts to two
<PB N="251" REF="261">
millions of guilders, each guilder 20d. Engli&s;h. The &s;alting and curing of herrings, which the Dutch fir&s;t learnt about the end of the fourth century from a fi&s;herman of Flanders, and in which no nation has equalled them ever &s;ince, has made the Dutch herrings univer&s;ally preferred before all others. Further, the whale fi&s;hery at Greenland, Spitzbergen, Nova Zem|bla, &amp;c. employs annually about two hundred and fifty &s;ail of Dutch &s;hips.</P>
<P>The United Netherlands are well cultivated and extremely populous; they contain no le&s;s than 113 cities and towns, with 1400 villages, &s;ome of which are very con&s;iderable, and about two millions of in|habitants. But the mo&s;t populous and the be&s;t cul|tivated is the province of Holland, which has not its equal in the univer&s;e; having &s;ix or more large cities within eight or ten miles of each other. The neat|ne&s;s of the hou&s;es, and of the canals, which are cut through the &s;treets, and planted with trees, as al&s;o the cleanline&s;s of the &s;treets, give the towns of this province a more agreeable appearance than is u&s;ually to be met with in other countries; and for pretty villages, no part of the globe can be put in competition with North Holland.</P>
<P>The&s;e countries, according to &s;ome writers, have been mo&s;t of them gained from the &s;ea. Others, on the contrary, are of opinion, that a great part of them
<PB N="252" REF="262">
have been lo&s;t by inundations, and both of them are in the right; for their &s;eas and rivers appear in many places to be above the land at high-water, and kept out only by prodigious banks; and there have been inundations even in the memory of man which have laid great tracks of land under water. The tops of &s;teeples or other high buildings have been &s;een upon their coa&s;ts at low water. Sir William Temple re|marks, that from the Zuider&s;ee never having been mentioned by any Roman writers, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that it was formed by &s;ome great inundation of the &s;ea breaking in between the Texel and other i&s;lands; and this is the more probable, from the great &s;hallowne&s;s of that &s;ea, and the flatne&s;s of its &s;ands over the whole extent of it. Other changes he &s;up|po&s;es to have happened in the face of the&s;e countries by the &s;ands which have gathered at the mouths of their great rivers above-mentioned.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ands are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been collected from the we&s;terly winds, which generally blow on the&s;e &s;hores three parts of the year, and are more violent than the ea&s;terly ones, which u&s;ually bring calm weather and fro&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Zuider&s;ee is about &s;eventy miles in length, and half as much in breadth, but &s;o very &s;hallow as has been ob&s;erved, that a pa&s;&s;age over it is more dangerous than a voyage in the Bay of Bi&s;cay. And &s;uch is the
<PB N="253" REF="263">
violence and rage of the &s;ea when the wind blows a &s;torm at north-we&s;t, that if it happens to be a &s;pring tide, their &s;tronge&s;t dykes &s;ometimes give way. An inundation happened in 1530, by which &s;eventy-two villages were &s;wallowed up, and 20,000 people de|&s;troyed. The banks of the&s;e rivers are al&s;o &s;ometimes broken down by &s;hoals of ice and land-floods. From the &s;hallowne&s;s of the water at neap tides at the mouth of this &s;ea, they are obliged to unload their ve&s;&s;els before they come in, and bring in their ve&s;&s;els in cradles.</P>
<P><HI>Rei&s;bec</HI> ob&s;erves, that there is no &s;olid earth in any part of Holland, and that even on the borders of the Duchy of Cleves, there are evident marks of this country's having been formed like the Egyptian Delta; with this difference, that the &s;oil on the banks of the Nile is more fruitful. Parts of Brabant have like|wi&s;e been formed by the Scheld, Mae&s;e, and other rivers. At a great di&s;tance from the coa&s;t in Flan|ders, under the good earth may be &s;een dry &s;and, and under this again, large layers of good earth; as if the rivers and &s;ea had by turns depo&s;ited their &s;and and their mud. The whole coa&s;t of Germany is of the &s;ame kind, as far as the Elbe. Throughout all this di&s;trict, &s;ays Rei&s;bec, there is no &s;olid ground.</P>
<P>The &s;ea forms boundaries to her&s;elf which &s;he never pa&s;&s;es, but in ca&s;es of extreme nece&s;&s;ity. Her playful

waves have made the downs, which reach from Calais to the Texel, and protect the land which is in &s;ome places lower than the &s;urface of the &s;ea; but when a north or north-we&s;t wind puts her into a fit of anger, &s;he overthrows in an in&s;tant that which with the help of the neighbouring rivers, &s;he has been building for many centuries. They tell you with a degree of confidence, that a &s;hip of 200 tons burthen was blown over the bank at high water, between Calais and Gravelines, on the &s;hore; the bank twenty feet higher than the &s;urface of the water.</P>
<P>The &s;ea of Haerlem grows wider every day, threatens to break the dykes between Leyden and Haerlem, and make a perfect i&s;land of North Hol|land. This &s;ea is &s;ixteen miles long, and nearly eight miles broad. In the la&s;t century, the &s;ea de|moli&s;hed a great part of the i&s;land in which Dordrecht is &s;ituated; and 60,000 people peri&s;hed by this ac|cident.</P>
<P>Dreadful as the &s;ea is to the main land, &s;he is &s;till a more formidable enemy to the i&s;lands which con|&s;titute the province of Zealand; but what &s;he exe|cutes on the continent, by violent &s;torms, &s;he under|takes here, by craft and cunning. Mo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands are lower than the &s;urface of the &s;ea; the in|habitants have, in con&s;equence, attempted to &s;ecure them&s;elves, by very expen&s;ive dykes, or banks.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="265">The &s;ea is perpetually undermining them, and wa&s;hing away the earth by degrees; in many places they are already quite naked. This compels the in|habitants to build other walls behind their dams, which, expecting the &s;ame fate, mu&s;t in time leave the whole to the mercy of the enemy.</P>
<P>Nor are the inhabitants of the middle of the coun|try in a better &s;ituation. The territories about Nime|guen and Arnheim, the mo&s;t beautiful and mo&s;t fruit|ful in all Holland, will in time be &s;ubdued by the Rhine. In many di&s;tricts about Betuve, the &s;and is already &s;o high, that at every &s;well the river is driven violently to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore; this will repeatedly happen, till it has finally broke it&s;elf a new bed, and covered with water all that is now ploughed land, or the &s;ite of villages and hamlets. The many canals which have been made to receive part of the waters of the&s;e rivers, are by no means &s;ufficient to break their force.</P>
<P>The&s;e canals, and the continual digging of turf, entirely dive&s;t this country of all &s;ecurity. In the direct line between Rotterdam and Am&s;terdam, there is dyke upon dyke; all the&s;e hollows have been occa|&s;ioned by digging away the turf; mo&s;t of them are &s;o deep that it is impo&s;&s;ible to draw the waters from them into the canals, which are on a level with the &s;urface of the &s;ea. What a ruin mu&s;t then take place,
<PB N="256" REF="266">
if once the waters of the neighbouring rivers break in upon them, or endeavour to open a way through them!</P>
<P>In &s;hort, no Dutchman can promi&s;e his children a durable habitation, except the inhabitants of Guel|derland, which is nothing but &s;and; and tho&s;e of Overy&s;&s;el and Drenthe&mdash;countries which are almo&s;t nothing but mora&s;&s;es and heaths, and the habitations of fevers, colds, and catarrhs.</P>
<P>Though this country is &s;o famous for its trade, and its multitude of &s;hipping, yet there is &s;carce a good harbour on the coa&s;t. The be&s;t are, Flu&s;hing, Hel|veot&s;luys, and Rotterdam. As for Am&s;terdam, there cannot be, any where, a more incommodious haven; being &s;eated in &s;o &s;hallow a water that very few &s;hips can get into it, except at high tide.</P>
<P>Every one knows that hu&s;bandry is not the great national object in Holland, but trade and manu|factures. Their territory is &s;mall in compari&s;on with their population; &s;o that an application to trade is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of the inhabitants. The quan|tity of land fit for tillage, was originally under &s;uch peculiar circum&s;tances, that the wealth which flowed in from trade and manufactures, could alone render the practice of any hu&s;bandry advantageous. The &s;oil is of two &s;orts, very good or very bad; and &s;o
<PB N="257" REF="267">
unhappily &s;ituated are the Dutch, that the former is only to be pre&s;erved by tho&s;e va&s;t monuments of their indu&s;try&mdash;the banks, which pre&s;erve all the lower and be&s;t lands from being overflowed; for the higher tracks of Friezland, Guelderland, &amp;c. contain in ge|neral, a very great proportion of wa&s;te, and poor, &s;andy &s;oil. This proportion is greater than is com|monly imagined, and was &s;o when the republic was undoubtedly in a more flouri&s;hing &s;ituation than at pre&s;ent. <HI>Davenant</HI> tells us, that in 1688, they had eight millions of Engli&s;h acres, which let, with hou&s;es and tenements, at four millions &s;terling. Now, this being only ten &s;hillings an acre, in a country very full of cities, mu&s;t very much reduce that ten &s;hil|lings per acre, probably to &s;ix &s;hillings; which &s;hews that this country of immen&s;e wealth and trade, though they &s;ecured the &s;oil by banks, yet did but little in rai&s;ing the value of land. Gra&s;s lands, indeed, let here at very high prices.</P>
<P>Whatever receives mo&s;t encouragement from the &s;tate, is &s;ure mo&s;t to pro&s;per trade being the great object in Holland; manufactures are very much at|tended to, the&s;e have con&s;equently pro&s;pered; but as to agriculture, and the landed intere&s;t, they make it totally &s;ub&s;ervient to every other; for the impor|tation of corn, and other provi&s;ions, is ruinous to the farmer, but is not regarded here, becau&s;e it is an object of commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="268">This conduct, however, is &s;uitable to the &s;ituation and intere&s;ts of the republic. Nature, and a fortune almo&s;t as ragged, has crammed them into a neglected mar&s;h, which nothing but an indu&s;try like theirs, could have made the habitation of an independent nation. In &s;uch a &s;tate, trade, navigation, fi&s;heries, and manufactures, were their principal &s;upport, in their fir&s;t naval expeditions again&s;t the Spaniards; the&s;e, therefore, they wi&s;ely engaged in, with their utmo&s;t ardour: But as to agriculture, of what benefit could it be to a nation, that had not land enough to render them&s;elves independent by it?</P>
<P>Nece&s;&s;ity drove the Hollanders to trade; but, had a genius more exten&s;ive than that of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> or of <HI>Monte&s;quieu,</HI> dictated to them a choice, it would have been what nece&s;&s;ity compelled. Indu&s;try will ever make the greate&s;t figure in tho&s;e &s;pots that deny every thing to idlene&s;s; a numerous people, in &s;uch &s;itua|tions, mu&s;t either be indu&s;trious or &s;tarve.</P>
<P>The great &s;ucce&s;s of the Dutch in trade, has made other nations ambitious to imitate them; but in this there appears too great a neglect of tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinctions, which are often found between different countries. France, England, Sweden, and Ru&s;&s;ia, have very con&s;iderable territories, con&s;equently they ought to pay a much greater attention to agriculture than this republic, who&s;e land is contemptible, com|pared

with theirs; but all the&s;e powers, particularly France and England, have &s;acrificed agriculture to their commerce. This has been very bad policy; for that conduct which may be very beneficial for a territory of eight millions of acres, may be highly improper for one of twelve times the number.</P>
<P>In the agriculture of Holland, the richne&s;s of their pa&s;tures is to be noticed, and the great attention they pay to the management of their cattle.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP II.</HI> Of the Province of Holland.</HEAD>
<P>WE will now &s;peak of the &s;everal provinces. The province of Holland, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the &s;even provinces, and in many re&s;pects equal to the other &s;ix, is bounded by the Zuider &s;ea on the north; by Utrecht on the ea&s;t; by Brabant on the &s;outh; and by the Briti&s;h ocean on the we&s;t; ex|tending about eighty miles in length; in &s;ome places forty in breadth, and in others not above twenty. It contains an area of about 400,000 acres. This
<PB N="260" REF="271">
province is u&s;ually divided into North and South Holland. South Holland contains all that country between Zealand and Brabant, and that arm of the &s;ea, which u&s;ually goes by the name of the river Y, And North Holland reaches from this river to the ocean.</P>
<P>It lyes, in general, very low, and, in &s;ome parts, even lower than the &s;ea, from which it is &s;ecured by dykes, and inter&s;ected by innumerable ditches and canals, through which, at the time of the ebb, the water is carried off. On the coa&s;ts of the north &s;eas, the &s;and-hills &s;upply the place of dykes. The air is foggy and unwhole&s;ome. The greate&s;t part of the province con&s;i&s;ts of fine pa&s;ture lands. The principal occupation of the country people is making butter and chee&s;e, and they accordingly keep a great num|ber of milch cows. This province &s;tands in need of all the art in the world, to embelli&s;h and make it ha|bitable. The air, in winter, is almo&s;t one continued fog; nothing is to be heard on the plains but the cries of &s;ea gulls, plovers, &s;wallows, crows, ducks, gee&s;e and &s;wans. Tho&s;e birds, which take refuge in the woods, are &s;eldom known here. Of all the provinces, none is &s;o much expo&s;ed to the fury of the ocean; and the inundations which happen from time to time are ter|rible. The fir&s;t which hi&s;tory mentions, formed the gulph called the Zuider &s;ea. Before that time, Friez|land was &s;eparated only by a &s;mall lake.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="272">In &s;everal parts of the country, the rivers which run through this country, are joined by navigable canals, which open a cheap communication between the &s;eve|ral towns and villages of this populous province; as, by means of the trech&s;cuyts, a pa&s;&s;enger goes from place to place on the&s;e canals, at fixed hours, and at very cheap rates. Goods are likewi&s;e &s;ent by the &s;ame conveyance, which is an un&s;peakable convenience to the inland trade.</P>
<P>This province abounds in the noble&s;t improvements, and is populous beyond compari&s;on with any of the other provinces; containing 37 towns, eight boroughs, and 400 villages; and the number of its inhabitants, on a careful e&s;timate, is computed at above a million of inhabitants, which is one half of the population of the whole country. The hou&s;es in the towns are mo&s;tly built of bricks; and for cleanline&s;s in them, no country in the world comes up to Holland: in North Holland, in particular, neatne&s;s and ornament are car|ried to an a&s;toni&s;hing pitch. In that province there are villages in which the rooms and furniture of the hou&s;es are clean and bright beyond imagination: the hou&s;es them&s;elves, as al&s;o the floors, and every wooden uten&s;il, both within and without, even to the very gates near the roads, and the po&s;ts in the pa&s;tures, again&s;t which the cows rub them&s;elves, as al&s;o the trunks of the trees, being painted over. The chimnies likewi&s;e, with the cow-&s;talls, both on the floor and on the &s;ides,
<PB N="262" REF="273">
are kept in the greate&s;t neatne&s;s. In the&s;e elegant cow-&s;talls, families them&s;elves re&s;ide, in order to &s;pare their dining rooms. The &s;treets, too, are paved with brick, and very carefully wa&s;hed and &s;trewed with a fine, white &s;and.</P>
<P>It is in this province, more than in any other, that the diver&s;ion of &s;kaiting is followed, from the multi|plicity of canals which inter&s;ect it. The Dutch, who in other re&s;pects are an indolent &s;et of people, are pa&s;&s;ionately fond of this exerci&s;e, and are the be&s;t &s;kaiters in Europe. Some of them will &s;kait fifteen miles in an hour. The ladies are drawn along in <HI>traineaux,</HI> a gentleman &s;itting behind them, and guid|ing the hor&s;e. There is no year, however, in which &s;ome accident does not happen from the&s;e aquatic amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>The Dutch have carried their ingenuity &s;o far as to contrive boats with &s;ails, fixed on &s;kaits or &s;ledges, to glide along on the ice: but the&s;e carriages are more for curio&s;ity than real u&s;e, as being by no means &s;afe. They move after the rate of fifteen leagues an hour; and, without reckoning up the other inconveniencies to their being put in practice, the re&s;i&s;tance of the air alone would be &s;ufficient to take any one's breath away, in travelling with &s;uch expedition. It is a&s;&s;ert|ed, that people have gone in this manner from Am|&s;terdam to Sardam in &s;even minutes&mdash;a di&s;tance of &s;even miles.</P>

<P><PB N="263" REF="275">The principal cities of the province of Holland are Am&s;terdam, Rotterdam, Leyden, Haerlem, Delft, Dort, and the Hague; of the&s;e we &s;hall &s;peak in their turns.</P>
<P>Am&s;terdam is the capital of this province, and of the United Netherlands. It is &s;ituated on the little river Am&s;tel, which runs through the city, and falls into that arm of the &s;ea called the Y, that lies on the north &s;ide of the town, and which forms a large har|bour. Am&s;terdam is the greate&s;t trading city of Europe, and though, by rea&s;on of the &s;hallowne&s;s of the pa&s;&s;age which leads up to it, from the Zuider &s;ea, it might be thought but badly &s;ituated for a &s;ea-port, as &s;hips of burthen mu&s;t be lightened to pa&s;s through it, and afterwards wait for an ea&s;terly or north-we&s;t wind to go into the north &s;ea; yet it is advantageous in this re&s;pect, that goods can be ea&s;ily carried backwards and forwards from all the other towns of this province, and with a fair wind it is but a few hours pa&s;&s;age to or from all the ports of North-Holland, Frie&s;land, Over|y&s;&s;el and Guelderland.</P>
<P>The ground is naturally mar&s;hy, con&s;equently the buildings at Am&s;terdam are founded on oaken piles, which made the facetious <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> &s;ay, that in his country va&s;t multitudes of people lived on the tops of trees. The middle of the town is inter&s;ected by a great number of navigable canals, which, while they conduce to the plea&s;antne&s;s and cleanline&s;s of the place,
<PB N="264" REF="276">
are at the &s;ame time a great convenience to trade; but in hot weather they emit foetid effluviae, which would be &s;till wor&s;e, were not the water kept continually in motion by two large water-mills and a hor&s;e-mill. In dark evenings, the&s;e canals u&s;ed to co&s;t many people their lives, till the&s;e dangers were happily remedied by illuminating the &s;treets and &s;ides of the canals: compared however with the &s;treets of London, they are at pre&s;ent but mi&s;erably lighted up. The&s;e canals divide the town into a multitude of i&s;lands, which are joined with each other by means of &s;tone and wooden bridges. This town it&s;elf forms a &s;emicircle on the Y, being fortified on the land-&s;ide with ramparts and regular ba&s;tions. This &s;ide of the town may likewi&s;e be laid under water. On this river is a mo&s;t delight|ful walk commanding a fine pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>Am&s;terdam, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> appears to no great ad|vantage to a &s;tranger on his fir&s;t coming to it, except he enters the city through the Heeregraft, or the Key|&s;ergraft &s;treets: that of Haerlem is very long, but the &s;luices in the canal hurt the effect of it; the two for|mer have al&s;o canals in the middle of them, and are very noble &s;treets; but like mo&s;t in Holland are planted with trees. Some of the canals are very broad, and make a fine appearance; but the hou&s;es in general are not erected in a grand &s;tile; on the contrary, very many of them di&s;grace the areas before them. This, though an evil, is an evil to be found in
<PB N="265" REF="277">
all the cities of Europe, and e&s;pecially in London. In &s;quares this great city appears to be very deficient; they are few in number, and have nothing in them &s;triking: that called the Dam is the principal, but it is very irregular. The hou&s;es, like all tho&s;e in Flan|ders, are in the old Gothic &s;tile, with pediment roofs, and being generally out of the perpendicular, are prevented from falling by iron cramps in the form of the capital S. To a pa&s;&s;enger in the &s;treet, by hang|ing over on both &s;ides, they &s;eem to threaten his life.</P>
<P>Though Am&s;terdam cannot boa&s;t many fine &s;quares, like &s;everal other capital cities, yet it contains &s;ome public buildings, that &s;trike the &s;pectator with a&s;toni&s;h|ment at their magnificence.</P>
<P>The building which is incomparably beyond all others, is the &s;tadthou&s;e: the dimen&s;ions of the front, as given by &s;everal authors, is 282 feet, the depth 232, and the height 116 feet, be&s;ides a &s;mall cupola. It was begun in 1648. It is built upon wooden piles like ma&s;ts of &s;hips, rammed down as thick as they can &s;tand. There are no le&s;s than 14,000 of them, which are &s;aid to have co&s;t 100,000l.; there being a great quantity of iron-work employed in the foundation, to keep the piles together. The &s;uper&s;tructure is &s;aid to have co&s;t twice as much. The expence of this edifice, however, has been variou&s;ly computed, with &s;uch an amazing difference, as from 300,000l. to 3,000,000l.;
<PB N="266" REF="278">
the latter mu&s;t certainly be computed according to the different value of money then and now; but even &s;o, it mu&s;t very much exceed the truth: the former is, in all probability, much nearer the reality. The front of this building has nothing of ta&s;te or elegance; it is a heavy pile, which &s;trikes the &s;pectator with that idea which is rai&s;ed by the grandeur of its magnitude. The in&s;ide is fini&s;hed in a very noble &s;tyle, con&s;ider|ing the purpo&s;e to which it is applied; &s;uch as, a pri|&s;on, a bank, the &s;eat of the courts of ju&s;tice, the &s;e&s;|&s;ions-rooms, guard-rooms, &amp;c. The three &s;tatues of bra&s;s, repre&s;enting Ju&s;tice, Fortitude and Plenty, at the entrance, and the woman in marble, <HI>in relievo,</HI> &s;upporting the city arms, are mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pieces: the tower above, with the clock and its admirable chimes; the Atlas, with the globe on his &s;houlders, as al&s;o all the other beauties and ornaments of &s;culpture and painting, are &s;carce to be equalled in Europe. The floors, walls, and pillars are, in general, of mar|ble, and the roofs finely carved, painted, and gilt; and many of the apartments are adorned with very fine paintings, by the be&s;t Flemi&s;h ma&s;ters. In the &s;e|cond &s;tory is a great magazine of arms; and over that, great re&s;ervoirs of water, with tubes to conduct it into every apartment; and another precaution, which has been taken again&s;t fire, is, lining the chimnies with copper. The top of the cupola gives a view of the city, and neighbouring country, in great per|fection, commanding the whole circumference; which,
<PB N="267" REF="279">
with the canals, and the immen&s;e number of &s;hips continually going in and coming out of the harbour, altogether form a very noble pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The entrance to this building is through &s;even &s;mall doors, but the want of a large door &s;uitable to the grandeur of the building, is a de&s;igned omi&s;&s;ion; the &s;even doors in number and uniformity, repre|&s;enting the &s;even United Provinces.</P>
<P>The bank of Am&s;terdam, which is the lower apart|ment, is famous all over the world. The great trea|&s;ure &s;aid to be locked up in the vaults of this hou&s;e, are the &s;ums received in purcha&s;e, not of bank &s;tock, but of bank-transfer. This is not like that of Lon|don, a bank that circulates notes in return for ca&s;h; on the contrary, it is a bank of depo&s;it; whoever pays money here has it entered in the bank-books, but can never again demand it. When he wants to rai&s;e mo|ney, he offers his bank credit for &s;ale, which is tran&s;|ferred in a moment, and any &s;ums of money may al|ways be rai&s;ed upon it.</P>
<P>The trea&s;ure in the bank in Am&s;terdam is an intire &s;e|cret to all but tho&s;e who have the management of it; the value has been computed, or rather gue&s;&s;ed at; and &s;up|po&s;ed to be from 20 to 40 millions &s;terling; but to name any particular &s;um mu&s;t at the be&s;t be but gue&s;&s;ing at random. It is however a very a&s;toni&s;hing &s;y&s;tem of
<PB N="268" REF="280">
accumulation; for it is a well-known fact, that money once paid into the bank-books can never be demand|ed; and further, that money is perpetualy paid in. Here, therefore, there &s;eems to be a con&s;tant ingre&s;s, but no egre&s;s; con&s;equently a trea&s;ure which &s;eems perpetually increa&s;ing.</P>
<P><HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> &s;ays, that though by the regulations of the bank, no money can be paid to any per&s;on that de|mands it, in con&s;equence of his credit on the bank; yet it is certain the bank lends both money and credit to the brokers, who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to buy bank credit, and give ca&s;h for it. The&s;e people attend every morning between eleven and twelve, before the Stadthou&s;e, either to buy or &s;ell bank-credit, as occa|&s;ion may offer.</P>
<P><HI>Hanway,</HI> who gives the be&s;t account of this bank, does it in the following words: As the bank of Am|&s;terdam receives only the be&s;t and pure&s;t coin, or bul|lion, the bank-money bears a commi&s;&s;ion of 4 or 5 per cent. If a per&s;on is de&s;irous to raeli&s;e his bank-credit, he di&s;po&s;es of it with greater facility than we &s;ell bank-&s;tock. Here they make payments after the manner of the bank of Venice, viz. by transferring in the books of the bank, from the credit of one to the credit of another: the&s;e transfers are made by the per&s;onal appearance of the transferror, by his order, for which there are printed forms; or by virtue of
<PB N="269" REF="281">
his power of attorney. Though no money can be claimed again, when once paid into the bank, yet in ca&s;es of depo&s;its, the &s;ame identical gold and &s;ilver may be reclaimed by him who delivered it in; for which purpo&s;e he has a permit renewable every &s;ix months, otherwi&s;e to become invalid. In which lat|ter ca&s;e, the ca&s;h &s;o delivered, is blended with the common &s;tock, and transferable only in the manner already mentioned. Though this bank pays no in|tere&s;t, yet it receives intere&s;t for the &s;ame loan, to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-India Companies; the large &s;ums of money lent to the Dutch Government, are entirely independent of this bank; the revenues of each re|&s;pective province being engaged as a &s;ecurity for &s;uch &s;um.</P>
<P>The great hall is a noble room indeed, adorned on all &s;ides with the fine&s;t marble pillars of the Corinthian order; but the floor of marble is the mo&s;t &s;urprizing of all, which is &s;o laid as to repre&s;ent without the ad|dition of any other lines than the veins of the marble, both the cele&s;tial and the terre&s;trial globes. Each of the&s;e marble maps, as they are &s;tyled, being twenty-two feet in diameter.</P>
<P>Below &s;tairs are the pri&s;ons both for debtors and criminals, with a guard-chamber, where the keys of the city are locked up every night. The &s;overeign power of this city is lodged in 36 &s;enators, who con|tinue
<PB N="270" REF="282">
members for life; and when any of them die, the remaining &s;enators elect others in their room, the people having no &s;hare in the nomination or choice: the &s;enate likewi&s;e elect the deputies to be &s;ent to the &s;tates of Holland, and appoints the chief magi&s;trates of the city, who are &s;aid to re&s;emble the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London. The Burgoma&s;ters are four in number, three of which are cho&s;en annually.</P>
<P>The police of this city &s;eems worthy of imitation. Notwith&s;tanding its being the fir&s;t trading city in the world, and a conflux of all &s;orts of people, it &s;eldom happens that there are above one or two executions here in the cour&s;e of the year. What is more &s;ingu|lar, no per&s;on can be put to death without previou&s;ly &s;igning his own condemnation, acknowledging his guilt and the ju&s;tice of his &s;entence, which is done with great form and ceremony, in a room of the Stadt|hou&s;e, expo&s;ed to the open air at two different times. The number of debtors too is very incon&s;iderable; every creditor here, as in mo&s;t parts of the conti|nent, is obliged to allow a maintenance to the per&s;on he impri&s;ons, proportionate to his &s;tation in life.</P>
<P>The exchange is a large building, and well adapted to the purpo&s;e, but it is unornamented, and not equal in architecture to that of London; the con|trivance of numbering the pillars, in order to find
<PB N="271" REF="283">
a merchant the more readily, is very convenient. It was very imprudently built on a canal; this circum|&s;tance &s;et &s;ome wicked per&s;ons about &s;ixty or &s;eventy years &s;ince, to endeavour to blow it up, while the merchants were a&s;&s;embled; for this purpo&s;e they pro|cured a large quantity of powder and other com|bu&s;tibles, which they placed under the bridge that goes over it; a child however blew out the match which prevented the fatal effects that would otherwi&s;e have en&s;ued. As an acknowledgement for the pre|&s;ervation of &s;uch a number of the inhabitants, all the children in Am&s;terdam have the privilege of coming and playing in the exchange the fir&s;t three days of the fair in the afternoon, and of making as much noi&s;e as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The admiralty, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> is the next public edifice that demands attention; the &s;ize of it, with its environs, is very con&s;iderable. It con&s;i&s;ts of three &s;ides of a &s;quare; the front being 220 feet long, and the wings the &s;ame; in the mid&s;t is the yard for building. The arms and &s;tores belonging to the &s;hips are kept here in very great order. The ground-floor is filled with cannon balls; and the &s;econd contains the arms and cordage; the third their &s;ails, public flags, &amp;c. Be&s;ides the&s;e, here are many other curi|o&s;ities of the naval kind, which are worth viewing. The dock is 508 feet long; and contiguous to it, are the hou&s;es for lodging the carpenters, &amp;c. The or|der
<PB N="272" REF="284">
in which every thing is kept cannot fail of &s;trik|ing every one. This building with its contents has been lately de&s;troyed by fire.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;t-India hou&s;e and Ar&s;enal are great build|ings, which much de&s;erve viewing. In the former, the company hold their meetings, and have very con|&s;iderable magazines of all &s;orts of India goods. The ar&s;enal is 2,000 feet &s;quare every way; it contains docks for building the &s;hips, and warehou&s;es and &s;tores for completely rigging them, all in excellent order. They have magazines of all &s;orts of naval &s;tores; in one they have many pieces of heavy artillery, and in another more than 600 large anchors ready for u&s;e. The two rope-walks are 18,000 feet long.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal public buildings in this city; but there are others which will attract the atten|tion of travellers; &s;uch as, the works going forward in the harbours, the &s;luices, the ba&s;tions, with each a windmill, the bridges, &amp;c. As to ho&s;pitals, there are a great number of them, but the architecture of the edifices is nothing; it is however highly worthy of ob&s;ervation, that all the poor of Am&s;terdam, and in|deed of all the provinces, are maintained by charity, there being no poor-tax in any country in Europe, except England; the &s;ame fund &s;upports all the ho&s;|pitals, in which there are above twenty thou&s;and people.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="285">At all the public inns and taverns, and at tho&s;e hou&s;es in which any public bu&s;ine&s;s is tran&s;acted, there are poor-boxes, into which, it is u&s;ual to put contributions from all &s;ales, auctions, &amp;c. Certain per&s;ons are al&s;o appointed to go and collect alms from time to time, and at all the public fe&s;tivals, which are applied to the &s;ame u&s;e: the theatres, and places of amu&s;ement of every kind, pay a third or a half of their gains for the like purpo&s;e; and if this is not &s;ufficient, government makes good the remainder. Every per&s;on entering the gates of Am&s;terdam, after dark, pays a penny to the poor; but after a certain hour of the night, (eleven or twelve,) none can enter the city till the next morning.</P>
<P>In all the towns of Holland, they take excellent precaution to force the idle to work. They have a hou&s;e of correction, called a ra&s;p-hou&s;e, in which they &s;hut up the idle poor and vagrants, that can work and maintain them&s;elves, but will not. The employ|ment they give them is to &s;aw and ra&s;p Brazil wood; in which if they are not expeditious, they are &s;everely beaten; and for tho&s;e who are lazy, they have an admirable contrivance, which is a cellar with a pump, into which they let water, &s;o proportioned to the &s;trength of the per&s;on, that he &s;hall be able, with infinite labour in pumping it out, to &s;ave him&s;elf from being drowned; which fate tho&s;e who are put there are, by law, doomed to &s;uffer, if they
<PB N="274" REF="286">
do not e&s;cape it by hard working; and for &s;uch as are incorrigibly idle, this labour is admirably adapted. In the&s;e pri&s;ons they al&s;o put young men who&s;e de|bauchery or extravagance threatens the ruin of their health and fortune; and this is done at any time on the reque&s;t of their parents or guardians: women are likewi&s;e &s;ometimes permitted to confine their hu&s;|bands in the&s;e pri&s;ons, on a complaint of their being extravagant. It does not however appear that this is effected by virtue of any written law, but through cu&s;tom and ancient u&s;age.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved of the ho&s;pitals in this country, as well as of tho&s;e in England, that they re&s;emble the palaces of princes more than the habitations of poor people. There are hou&s;es al&s;o where a per&s;on may have his diet and lodging as long as he lives, on the payment of a &s;mall &s;um of money in advance.</P>
<P>As to churches, the only one worthy of being men|tioned is the new one, dedicated to St. Catharine; the ornamental parts of which are fini&s;hed in a mo&s;t capi|tal manner. The pulpit is carved in the riche&s;t &s;tyle; the chancel is parted off by a railing of Corinthian bra&s;s; the windows are likewi&s;e finely painted, and the organ is the be&s;t in the low countries, except that at Haerlem; and they &s;ay at Am&s;terdam, the be&s;t in the whole world: it has a row of pipes, de&s;igned to counterfeit a chorus of voices, which it performs very
<PB N="275" REF="287">
badly; there are fifty-two whole &s;tops be&s;ides the half ones, with two rows of keys for the feet, and three for the hands. Here is to be &s;een a mo&s;t magnificent tomb of the brave Admiral <HI>de Ruyter;</HI> his effigy lying at large, with all &s;orts of trophies in marble, &s;culpture and relievo, with large in&s;criptions. In one of the ai&s;les of this church is another &s;umptuous monument, erected to the memory of <HI>John Van Galen,</HI> another of their admirals, with a very fine in&s;cription.</P>
<P>This church, however, is not yet fini&s;hed, though it has been begun more than an hundred years ago; the &s;teeple was de&s;igned to have been much higher: more than 6,000 piles have already been driven into the ground in an area of one hundred feet &s;quare, as a foundation for it; but &s;till they thought the bog|gine&s;s of the ground not &s;ufficiently remedied for &s;up|porting &s;o great a weight, as this &s;teeple would be, if it were fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The number of churches, of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion in this great city, does not exceed thirteen; but &s;eve|ral of them have two galleries one over the other, and contain a prodigious number of people. There are, however, upwards of four&s;core Roman-catholic cha|pels, be&s;ides a great number of others, belonging to different &s;ects of the prote&s;tants: none of the&s;e, how|ever, are permitted to marry, according to their re|&s;pective rites, without the marriages being fir&s;t &s;o|lemnized
<PB N="276" REF="288">
before a magi&s;trate; nor any per&s;ons admit|ted to offices in the &s;tate, but tho&s;e of the pre&s;byte|rian or e&s;tabli&s;hed religion.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, that the Jews of Am&s;terdam live in more &s;plendour than in any part of the world. They re&s;ide in a peculiar quarter of the city, re&s;embling a little town, and have two &s;ynagogues; one not inferior to the be&s;t church in London, and the other though not near &s;o &s;umptuous, exceeds any they have at Rome or Venice; be&s;ides which, they have &s;chools in which they educate their youth in their own religion and language. I went once, &s;ays &s;ome writer, into their &s;ynagogue, where were about 2,000 men and boys with white &s;ilk hoods over their &s;houlders, li&s;tening to two others, who had but little re&s;emblance to prie&s;ts, and who were explaining the laws at the lower end of the church: at every period they were repeating their great Ala, or Allalujah, to which the re&s;t did not &s;eem very attentive.</P>
<P>The manufactures carried on in this city, are more numerous and con&s;iderable than at any other place in the &s;even provinces; they weave all &s;orts of cloths, woollens, &s;tuffs, and &s;ilk, gold and &s;ilver &s;ilks, ribbons, tape&s;try, linen in large quantities, &amp;c. All &s;orts of fabrics in leather, with many in ivory and metals, are likewi&s;e carried on here: they have al&s;o a great va|riety of mills for &s;awing, poli&s;hing, &amp;c. Their &s;ail-cloth
<PB N="277" REF="289">
and paper-manufactories are likewi&s;e very con|&s;iderable; and the printing of books &s;hould not be forgotten; they print in all languages. Here are great numbers of book&s;ellers, who it is thought employ twice the quantity of pre&s;&s;es that work at London: the&s;e books are exported to England, and &s;ome to the &s;outhern parts of Europe; but va&s;t numbers to all parts of Germany, Denmark and the North.</P>
<P>Am&s;terdam can boa&s;t of no great antiquity; it owes its origin to a few fi&s;hing villages, and was fir&s;t wall|ed in about 1482. Its pre&s;ent number of inhabi|tants is computed by <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> at 300,000. <HI>Bu&s;ching</HI> makes the number only 200,000. The foreigners re|&s;orting hither from time to time likewi&s;e form a very con&s;iderable number.</P>
<P>The air of this city, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> is &s;o bad and foggy, that I can hardly believe the a&s;&s;ertion of tho&s;e who affirm it to be healthy. It is &s;urrounded entirely by the &s;ea and by mar&s;hes; the canals are very nu|merous, and not always free from noxious exhala|tions. The cleanline&s;s, indeed, of the inhabitants is car|ried to as great a height as po&s;&s;ible, but this by no means remedies the evil; for that eternal wa&s;hing mu&s;t add to the damps, which are otherwi&s;e &s;o unwhole&s;ome in this country. The be&s;t part of their cleanline&s;s, is that exerted in keeping their canals clean; but I mu&s;t
<PB N="278" REF="290">
remark, &s;ays he, I &s;aw no &s;mall neglect of this mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential object.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t u&s;eful of the four elements, water, with which the Dutch are &s;urrounded, is not to be pro|cured here fit for drinking, without great difficulty. What is generally u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, is that which is had from the clouds; they have likewi&s;e water which they procure from a &s;mall river, the Vecht, &s;ome miles di&s;tant; but even this is not very good.</P>
<P>The Dutch were formerly very attentive to have all their carriages placed on &s;ledges, and drawn only by one hor&s;e; this was certainly a wi&s;e precau|tion, con&s;idering that the whole city is on a founda|tion purely artificial, on piles; but this regulation is now but little attended to; for there are at pre&s;ent a great number of coaches on wheels: it is true they pay a very con&s;iderable tax, which, as the number of carriages increa&s;ed, has already been rai&s;ed once or twice, and amounts now to about &s;even pounds a|year, but &s;till as luxury increa&s;es, coaches on wheels increa&s;e; and the higher they are taxed, &s;ome &s;en&s;i|ble people are of opinion, the more they would in|crea&s;e.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;ledges, as it may be ea&s;ily con|ceived, if the body of a coach was conveyed through the &s;treets of London on a &s;ledge, that the lea&s;t irre|gularity

It will not appear &s;urpri&s;ing that the man who guides the hor&s;e, &s;hould walk by the &s;ide of the vehicle, to prevent any &s;uch accident: and if, from the pavement not being level, the carriage &s;hould incline towards him, he keeps it up with his &s;houlders; if, on the other hand, it inclines the contra|ry &s;ide, there is a rope fa&s;tened to the edge of the top of the coach, which he pulls towards him with all his might, to prevent the carriage from over&s;etting on the other &s;ide. This carriage is drawn with ropes by one hor&s;e; the driver has a bucket of water fa&s;tened to the &s;ledge, and a mop with which he is continual|ly wetting it; but as, <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> ob&s;erves, the&s;e car|riages are getting very much into di&s;u&s;e. They are however, the only public vehicles to be met with in that city, which are to be hired by the hour. It may be &s;uppo&s;ed the prices of &s;uch carriages cannot be very extravagant. There are carriages on wheels to be hired, but their prices are extravagant; and the permi&s;&s;ion of the burgoma&s;ters mu&s;t be previou&s;ly ob|tained.</P>

<P><PB N="280" REF="292">Re&s;pecting trade, this is the grand emporium, not only of the United Provinces, but the centre of all the commerce of Europe. For a general corre&s;pon|dence, it much exceeds London; but the gro&s;s amount of the trade of London, far exceeds that of Am&s;ter|dam. Two thou&s;and &s;ail of &s;hips annually enter this port, which mu&s;t form a va&s;t commerce; the different branches of which &s;hall be treated of hereafter.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome very good collections of natural hi&s;tory, drawings, paintings, and medals, in this city; which tho&s;e who are <HI>amateurs</HI> generally go to view, and which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors are always prepared to &s;hew. There is, in particular, a very fine collection of pic|tures, by the celebrated Mr. <HI>Hope,</HI> of Am&s;terdam, which all &s;trangers of any rank never fail of going to &s;ee; this gentleman is of Scotch extraction, a de|&s;cendant of the <HI>Hopeton</HI> family, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive merchants in the whole world. The compliment paid to him on the change at Am&s;terdam, is &s;o great, that it is never &s;up|po&s;ed to begin till he comes.</P>
<P>The price of living in Am&s;terdam, for a &s;tranger at a middling <HI>aub&eacute;rge,</HI> is nearly as follows: a florin or guilder a day, that is 20d. for the chamber; breakfa&s;t with tea as in England, co&s;ts ten &s;tivers or ten-pence; the dinner, with a pint of wine, thirty &s;tivers or half a crown; &s;upper the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="293">The beds con&s;i&s;t of four or five mattre&s;&s;es, with a very broad down-bol&s;ter, in&s;tead of pillow, generally fitted into the &s;ide of a room, like the cabin-bed of a &s;hip, with a rope hanging down from the top to catch hold of, in order to lift one's &s;elf up, when we wi&s;h to ri&s;e. Comfort and convenience &s;eem here to be &s;tudied; but on account of a number of the mattre&s;&s;es, they are four or five feet high from the floor; and a young couple, on their wedding night, unle&s;s their blood is truly Dutch, would run the hazard of breaking their necks; in truth, they are fit only for the mo&s;t &s;ober &s;leepers. Some have &s;ide-boards to prevent the cloaths falling off, and the &s;leeper falling out.</P>
<P><HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> gives a very different account of the ex|pences incident to a &s;tranger at Am&s;terdam for his diet and lodging; but then it &s;hould be recollected that he was an Engli&s;hman, and the writer from whom the above extract was made, a Frenchman. I was very fortunate in my quarters at Am&s;terdam, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> being recommended to a private family in trade, for lodgings. I dined for &s;ome days either at an ordinary, where I paid to the amount of ten &s;hillings for my dinner, or at &s;ome merchants hou&s;es to whom I was recommended: but afterwards I boarded with the family, who lived much better than I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed any people would do, who let lodgings. Their dinners were excellent, and dre&s;&s;ed in the French &s;tyle: but I paid, &s;ays he, twenty florins a-week for my
<PB N="282" REF="294">
lodgings, and &s;eventeen more for my board, &s;ervant included. This would be thought very dear in Lon|don, he adds; but owing to the difference of cu&s;tom in the two cities, board and hand&s;ome lodgings is not to be had in Am&s;terdam for any price.</P>
<P>Coffee-hou&s;es are to be met with in this city, the &s;ame as in London; but their internal appearance is very &s;habby. Different foreign papers are to be met with in them, but not upon that exten&s;ive &s;cale as in London. In mo&s;t of them &s;moaking is permitted, which renders the &s;mell of them at all times rather of|fen&s;ive; they are much frequented by the middling cla&s;s of Germans, and Frenchmen, who are everla&s;t|ingly di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the politics of Europe, with a &s;elf-&s;ufficiency and volubility of &s;peech, that is almo&s;t in|credible.</P>
<P>The &s;pill-hou&s;es mu&s;t not be omitted, which are a very &s;ingular e&s;tabli&s;hment of the kind, and not to be met with in any other town in Europe. The&s;e are public-hou&s;es licen&s;ed by the &s;tate, for the reception of girls of the town: both the girls who enter the&s;e hou&s;es, and the per&s;ons who are the owners, pay a tax to the &s;tate. To the&s;e places people of character re|&s;ort openly, without fear or &s;hame. There is as little &s;candal in being &s;een in one of them, as being &s;een at a play-hou&s;e, or any other place of amu&s;ement; the entertainments of the&s;e hou&s;es are mu&s;ic and dancing:
<PB N="283" REF="295">
the nymphs of this place, who are not engaged in dancing with their paramours, are &s;eated round the room; and every &s;tranger goes and talks to them if they are not previou&s;ly engaged, as long as be thinks proper; and generally offers them wine and other re|fre&s;hments, as he would to per&s;ons he mixed with at an a&s;&s;embly. They dance minuets and mattelots; and every man who takes out a girl to dance, pays &s;ix|pence to the mu&s;ic. If any one chu&s;es to retire with them, there are &s;mall rooms adjoining, furni&s;hed with a bed and other conveniences; and if a man with|draws with his mi&s;tre&s;s, he returns with her into the room; and no more notice is taken of him, than if he had only gone out to &s;peak to a friend. Though the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e hou&s;es was well meant, they are &s;eldom frequented but by &s;ailors and the lower cla&s;s of men and women; the girls are generally dirty, painted and patched. The States are of opinion, that if they did not indulge the people in this particu|lar, they &s;hould never be able to keep their wives and daughters cha&s;te; and therefore of two evils they chu&s;e the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es in general are old fa&s;hioned, and built, as we have ob&s;erved, with pediment tops; and tho&s;e &s;treets through which there is no canal, are narrow. One very &s;ingular circum&s;tance has been remarked by travellers in the&s;e narrow &s;treets, that mo&s;t of the hou&s;es &s;tand out of the perpendicular, and incline for|ward;
<PB N="284" REF="296">
and this happens not only with many of the hou&s;es, but even with the churches; &s;everal of the &s;teeples of which may be ob&s;erved far from upright. There are people in Holland who will engage under a heavy penalty, on being well compen&s;ated, to &s;et the &s;teeples as erect, as when they were fir&s;t built. The method they take is very &s;imple; it is merely to dig un|der the foundation of the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the building, which never fails to re&s;tore it to its perpendicular.</P>
<P>From Am&s;terdam to Utrecht is a fine broad canal; and for the di&s;tance of 12 miles from the former city, the banks are covered with country-hou&s;es, where the merchants of Am&s;terdam regale them&s;elves every Sun|day. Each hou&s;e has a &s;ummer-hou&s;e built on the ca|nal, that will hold ten or a dozen people; and in fine weather, they are generally full of people &s;moaking and drinking: each per&s;on di&s;tingui&s;hes his country-&s;eat by &s;ome motto either in Latin or Dutch, allu&s;ive to the happine&s;s of a retired life, painted on the outer gate. Their gardens are pretty, but in the old ta&s;te; parterres of flowers, long narrow alleys, &s;ome covered with vines, &amp;c. with &s;tatues at the end. Their hou&s;es are covered with fruit-trees; but from a care not to in|jure the building, a wooden frame is fixed again&s;t the hou&s;e, and the trees nailed again&s;t &s;uch frames. There being no gravel in the country, their walks are merely earth, kept free from weeds. Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are painted white, and window-frames and doors green;

and this contra&s;t is picture&s;que and plea&s;ing. They are generally built clo&s;e on the bank, a &s;andy road only pa&s;&s;ing between the river and the canal.</P>
<P>Rotterdam next to Am&s;terdam, is the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able town in Holland for largene&s;s, beauty of its buildings, trade, and riches; it is &s;ituated at the conflu|ence of the rivers Rotter and Mae&s;e. It has its name from the former of the&s;e rivers which runs into it on the north-we&s;t &s;ide, and dam, &s;ignifying in Dutch, a fence again&s;t the waters. This city, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> is &s;econd to Am&s;terdam alone, and comes nearer to that famous emporium of trade, than any port in England does to London. The Mae&s;e here is a very noble river, and canals are cut from it through every part of the city, which are &s;o deep and broad, that &s;hips of above 300 tons, load and unload directly into the quays and warehou&s;es on the banks, as &s;maller ve&s;&s;els do at Am|&s;terdam. The &s;ides of many of the canals are plant|ed with tall trees, which united with the ma&s;ts and flags of the &s;hipping, and the hou&s;es, form a very plea&s;ing &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>Rotterdam has greatly the advantage of Am&s;terdam, for convenience of commerce. Ships of large bur|then cannot go up to Am&s;terdam without unloading; but they may here come clo&s;e to the merchants hou&s;es. In winter both the Mae&s;e and the Texel are frozen up; but in the Mae&s;e the pa&s;&s;age is open much &s;ooner,
<PB N="286" REF="299">
which is a great advantage in trade; in&s;omuch, that 300 &s;ail of Briti&s;h &s;hips have been &s;een &s;ailing out of this harbour at once, when not a &s;hip in the Texel has been able to move. Add to this, that the country about Rotterdam is far more plea&s;ant, the air more healthy, and the water better; but the other being the &s;eat of government, counterbalances all the&s;e ad|vantages, and gives it infinitely a greater trade.</P>
<P>Nine-tenths of the Briti&s;h trade with the United Provinces centre at this place, which is owing to the advantage of its &s;ituation; many &s;hip-loads of goods con&s;igned for Am&s;terdam, are &s;ent hither, and go by canals to that city: &s;everal hundred &s;ail of Briti&s;h ve&s;|&s;els are &s;ometimes in this harbour at a time. There is al&s;o a con&s;iderable &s;hare of the Ea&s;t-India trade car|ried on here, with very great magazines of their goods; and a gla&s;s manufactory, which works only for the Ea&s;t-India &s;hips. I &s;aw in it, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> a va&s;t quantity of toys done in enamel, bowls, cups, &s;aucers, plates, figures, &amp;c. many of which were in a grote&s;que &s;tyle, and well executed: the&s;e, they told me, met with a ready &s;ale in the i&s;lands depending on the Dutch empire in tho&s;e regions.</P>
<P>Several of the &s;treets are very &s;pacious and well built; Heeren &s;treet is the fine&s;t; the hou&s;es are built of hewn &s;tones, but the Boompies is more agreeable, lying along the Mae&s;e, the length more than half a
<PB N="287" REF="300">
mile; it &s;eems like a va&s;t quay; on one &s;ide is a row of lofty elms, &s;kirted by the river, which is &s;ometimes full of &s;hips, and on the other, the &s;treet is bounded by very large and well-built hou&s;es. The be&s;t company in the city come here to walk in an evening. There are only four churches in this city of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, and none of them worth notice; but there is a large Engli&s;h chapel, where the &s;ervice of the church of England is performed by an Engli&s;h clergyman, pre|&s;ented to it by the bi&s;hop of London. The income about 100l. a-year. The Exchange is a very large and ma&s;&s;ive building, which gives a good idea of the place.</P>
<P>In the hou&s;es belonging to the merchants, both of this city as well as of Am&s;terdam, all the be&s;t apart|ments are on the &s;econd floor; the ground floors are u&s;ed for offices. On the fir&s;t-floors the families live; on the &s;econd &s;tory are the be&s;t rooms, and the garrets or upper &s;tories &s;erve for warehou&s;es; and as there are goods perpetually craning up into &s;ome or other of the warehou&s;es, it is not a little dangerous to walk along the &s;treets of either of the&s;e cities. In general they do not crane their goods up as in England by a wheel fixed in the warehou&s;e; but draw them by a hor&s;e, who&s;e harne&s;s is fixed to a rope wnich runs through the pulley of the crane; and thus running a con&s;iderable length along the &s;treet, draws up the goods.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="301">Some of the merchants hou&s;es are very magnifi|cent both here and at Am&s;terdam; for 6000l. &s;ter|ling is no price for a good hou&s;e; and they pride them|&s;elves in old-fa&s;hioned furniture. The rooms are lined with oil-cloth, &s;ome painted &s;imilar to our paper hang|ings, and &s;ome with ordinary land&s;capes; a gla&s;s lu&s;tre generally hangs in their be&s;t room, and Turkey carpets cover them, often of &s;uch dimen&s;ions as to be worth from thirty to a hundred pounds. The rooms dado high, are lined with wain&s;cot, and &s;ome with white marble; this with the oil-&s;kin hangings renders them ea&s;y to be wa&s;hed; the maids are cleaning the&s;e and the windows of the hou&s;e every day of the week; the curtains and bed-furniture are always taken down and wa&s;hed, when the lea&s;t &s;oiled; and of cour&s;e though a Dutch hou&s;e may be damp, it is remarkably clean and well kept.</P>
<P>This city is very famous for having given birth to <HI>Ero&s;mus.</HI> Little as the Dutch affect to admire literature, they one and all &s;hew the hou&s;e in which he was born, with a kind of o&s;tentation. On the great bridge is a tolerable &s;tatue of him in bra&s;s; he is repre&s;ented with a flowing gown, a cap on his head, and a large folio book in his hand, wide open; the pede&s;tal is of mar|ble inclo&s;ed with iron rails; the expre&s;&s;ion, &s;ays <HI>Mar|&s;hal,</HI> is nothing remarkable; and in that particular we perfectly agree with him. Among Dutchmen, <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> might be a very learned man; but among
<PB N="289" REF="302">
learned men, we apprehend him to have been, at the be&s;t but a &s;econd-rate genius. There is nothing elevated or &s;ublime in his writings, and tho&s;e com|po&s;itions of his which are in mo&s;t reque&s;t, are emi|nently characteri&s;tic of the genius of the country-buffoonery and low humour.</P>
<P>All &s;orts of provi&s;ions are very dear at this place, where fi&s;h is far from cheap; the Dutch are amazing|ly indu&s;trious, and the lower cla&s;s very frugal; was that not the ca&s;e, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to live. Were the poor at Rotterdam to &s;quander away as much money in drink, as they do in the great trad|ing towns of England, they would &s;tarve: this may be ea&s;ily conceived, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> when I inform my readers, that during my &s;tay here, bread was never le&s;s than twopence half-penny a pound, and that I could not live decently with one &s;ervant at the inn, for le&s;s than twenty florins a day, which is one pound thir|teen &s;hillings and four-pence; this, &s;ays he, is cer|tainly as dear as in England. Wine, he adds, is cheaper than in England, but they have a great deal that is very bad. The red wine that is generally met with on the continent out of France, particularly in Flanders, Germany, and Holland is a thick, mud|dy kind of claret, and con&s;iderably &s;tronger; perhaps from a mixture of brandy with it, than genuine claret. This wine is to be had on the continent for about

two &s;hillings a bottle, and has a roughne&s;s like port. There is only one &s;pill-hou&s;e in this town.</P>
<P>In the year 1732, the number of taxed hou&s;es were e&s;timated at between &s;ix and &s;even thou&s;and, and the inhabitants at between fifty and &s;ixty thou&s;and. The regency is compo&s;ed of twenty-four coun&s;ellors, and a court of ju&s;tice, con&s;i&s;ting of a chief judge, four burgoma&s;ters and &s;even aldermen.</P>
<P>Dort is an incon&s;iderable town compared with Am&s;terdam and Rotterdam, yet its deputies rank fir&s;t in the a&s;&s;embly of deputies, from the different towns in Holland; whereas the Hague being con&s;idered only as a village, &s;ends no deputies to the &s;tates of Hol|land. However, the Hague, from its being the re&s;i|dence of the Court, the place where the States-general a&s;&s;emble, and the centre of attraction to all foreigners; we &s;hall proceed to treat of it, after having premi&s;ed one or two particulars re&s;pecting the town of Dort, which is the mo&s;t ancient in the province of Holland, as well as the fir&s;t in dignity. This is the only town in the province where they have the privilege of coining money. In the year 1619 a famous &s;ynod was held in this city for exami|ning the opinion of the Arminians and Calvini&s;ts.</P>

between the Arminians and the Anti-arminians, Re|mon&s;trants and Anti-remon&s;trants, prede&s;tinarians, latitudinarians, &amp;c. who all pretend to give a true in|terpretation of the articles e&s;tabli&s;hed in this &s;ynod. Some Arminians &s;uffered death for the cau&s;e, and the celebrated <HI>Grotius</HI> was impri&s;oned, and would have probably &s;hared the &s;ame fate, had he not e&s;caped by artifice, and fled to Paris, where he was highly care&s;|&s;ed by the French king, and allowed a pen&s;ion of a thou&s;and crowns a year. His e&s;cape was effected by means of his wife, in the following manner. He had obtained leave for a great trunk of books to be brought him, which he &s;ent backwards and forwards &s;everal times for near a twelvemonth; it was at fir&s;t diligently &s;earched by the guards, but finding nothing but books and linen, they did not trouble them&s;elves to look into it, as it pa&s;&s;ed; on which his wife per&s;uaded him to lock him&s;elf into the trunk, and endeavour to make his e&s;cape, and he was accordingly carried off without any &s;u&s;picion. His lady who was left behind in the apartment, lay upon the bed, in her hu&s;band's night-gown and cap, pretending to be ill; whereby prevented any enquiry after him for &s;everal days. For this meditated &s;cheme, &s;he was in danger of being condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment, but was at length by a majority of her judges formally di&s;charged, and followed her hu&s;band to France, where many other Arminians met with a kind reception, and were allowed liberty of con&s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="306">This town likewi&s;e gave birth to the famous <HI>De Witt.</HI> It carries on a con&s;iderable commerce in tim|ber and Rheni&s;h wine, by means of the Rhine, which flows by its walls; though not &s;o much as formally. There are at pre&s;ent in it about 18,000 inhabitants. Its &s;ituation is naturally &s;o &s;trong, that though it has no fortifications, it was never yet taken. It is an i&s;land which was formed in 1421, by a terrible inundation, which de&s;troyed &s;eventy-two villages, in which, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> there peri&s;hed not le&s;s than 100,000 per|&s;ons.

The fortifica|tions give it the repute of being &s;trong; but the fine&s;t object is the river Mae&s;e at high water, which is near two miles over, and the fight of which, though beautiful to view, has not proved very plea&s;ing to many an Engli&s;h traveller, who perhaps fondly imagi|ned that when he had once got on <HI>terra firma</HI> in Holland, he &s;hould no more be obliged to tru&s;t him|&s;elf on that element which brought him there, ex|cept

<P>The hou&s;es are in general uniform, built of brick, with &s;harp roofs and pointed fronts. What renders this city very famous in Holland is, that the Count <HI>de la Marc</HI> &s;eized upon it with his <HI>gueu&s;es</HI> or beggars in 1572, and by his brave example drew the other towns of the Netherlands into a general revolt.</P>
<P>Hague is a mo&s;t beautiful place, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> &s;itu|ated in a very delightful country, without either gates or walls. It is &s;urrounded however by a moat which is pa&s;&s;ed over at the entrance of the town by draw-bridges.</P>
<P>Its environs are exceedingly plea&s;ant, from being bounded on the ea&s;t by verdant meadows; on the &s;outh by &s;plendid &s;eats; on the we&s;t by the &s;and-hills along the North Sea, on which &s;ide there is a &s;traight avenue paved with clinkers, and a two-foot walk for pa&s;&s;engers, planted with &s;everal rows of trees, leading to the village of Scheveling, about two miles di&s;tant; and northward is a delightful wood, in which the Stadt|holder has a country &s;eat. This village, the fir&s;t of its kind in Europe, is the re&s;idence of the States-general of the &s;tates of Holland, of the courts of ju&s;tice, and of the foreign mini&s;ters.

The &s;treets are broad and regular, but few of them without trees; the &s;quares, like ancient Athens, are &s;urrounded with groves; and the numerous gardens, with the &s;urround|ing meadows, hardly ever broken in upon by tho&s;e receptacles of filth, and brick-kilns, which &s;urround London, render it quite rural, and make it delightful to tho&s;e who admire &s;uch views in the mid&s;t of a city.

<P>The &s;treets of the Hague are extremely well paved with clinkers, that wear an appearance of bricks; the joints are &s;o well clo&s;ed, that they admit of wa&s;hing like a hou&s;e; and the inhabitants &s;eem to vie with each other in this public cleanline&s;s; tho&s;e of each hou&s;e keeping that &s;pot clean which is before it, which makes walking in them exceeding plea&s;ant. This &s;pirit of neatne&s;s maybe ob&s;erved at Rotterdam and mo&s;t other towns in Holland; but the pavements not being &s;o good, the effects are not &s;o very vi&s;ible as they are here. This great attention in the Dutch however to the keeping of their hou&s;es clean, &s;eems rather on the decline: there being many hou&s;es in England kept to the full as clean as any in Holland. But this extends only to the better ranks of people. For among the lower cla&s;s, there is no compari&s;on between the two nations. A Dutch cottage, or the hou&s;e of an inferior trade&s;man, is kept as clean as po&s;&s;ible, though there be ever &s;o many children in it; but in England &s;uch habitations are too often the re&s;idence of filth and na&s;tine&s;s. We have a female character, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> among&s;t us who is called a daudle, but &s;uch a being is not known in Holland.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="310">There is one article which is found great fault with by &s;trangers at the Hague, and that is the expence of fuel. A fire of wood will co&s;t as much as &s;even fires in London; and I &s;aw no coal, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal;</HI> turf is the only firing. This I do not di&s;like, he adds; its making no &s;moak, which from &s;ea-coal is offen&s;ive to the &s;mell, and from wood prejudicial to the eyes, an advantage much in its favour; be&s;ides the mo&s;t a&s;th|matic per&s;on will find no inconvenience to his breath from turf. But as to &s;toves &s;o much u&s;ed in this and other northern countries, they are extremely di&s;agree|able: cu&s;tom might reconcile them; but an Engli&s;h fire far exceeds all the&s;e contrivances.</P>
<P>This place appears very different from any other of the Dutch towns; bu&s;ine&s;s and making money is all that is going forward at Rotterdam, but at the Hague there is nothing of the kind: to make amends for which, there is as much good company as in any city of Europe. It is the court of the Prince of Orange, con&s;equently all the foreign mini&s;ters make it their place of re&s;idence; and the meetings of the States-general are ever held in this place: the number of elegant equipages is great, the expen&s;ive dre&s;&s;es, the quantity of &s;ervants, and the general air of luxury and plea&s;ure, carry a very different appearance from any thing to be met with el&s;ewhere. But though there, are &s;uch a number of idle people here who &s;pend very great incomes, yet &s;till the Hague is very
<PB N="297" REF="311">
badly off for public diver&s;ions. The chief place of public amu&s;ement here is a French theatre, and this is chiefly &s;upported by the &s;ub&s;criptions of foreign mini&s;ters. Operas are indeed occa&s;ionally performed when &s;ingers are to be had; but where comedies are badly performed, no very &s;anguine expectations will be entertained of any great degree of excellence in their operas. Concerts they have very often, but the be&s;t are at private hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The public buildings at the Hague make no figure; the hou&s;es; the form of the &s;treets and &s;quares, are in general infinitely &s;uperior; &s;ome of the&s;e indeed appear very magnificent. The palace, as they call it, has &s;everal courts, but it is a very antiquated building. Nor is that which belonged to prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of Na&s;&s;au, and where the council of war now a&s;&s;emble, in the lea&s;t remarkable. Notwith&s;tanding this place is &s;o extremely populous, there are but two churches in it. One of them is of a circular figure without pillars, a mode of building which the Dutch &s;eem to admire.</P>
<P>The Voohout is the Dutch Mall, and is about as broad as that of St. James's. It was planted by the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V.; there are three alleys for car|riages, and the buildings oppo&s;ite to it make a good appearance; but what is very &s;ingular, in&s;tead of
<PB N="298" REF="312">
gravel, they have laid it with cockle-&s;hells, which are very unplea&s;ant to walk upon. This, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> is very &s;trange, as gravel might be had from us at no great expence. Sand is the general &s;ub&s;titute in Holland, which takes off very much from the beauty of their gardens and public walks. This Mall is however as much de&s;erted as our Ring.</P>
<P>The Prince Graft is a very noble &s;treet, near half a mile long, of a a fine breadth, and as &s;traight as an arrow; a &s;pacious canal, planted on both &s;ides, runs along the middle of it, with &s;everal &s;tone bridges having iron ballu&s;trades, over it; the hou&s;es, e&s;pecially tho&s;e on one &s;ide, make a very grand appearance, and the whole in &s;hort is very ornamental to the Hague. But this &s;treet is a &s;trong proof that planting of trees has not an effect equal to a fine range of buildings unaccompanied by them. A canal cut through a very wide &s;treet, and faced with &s;tone, agrees extremely well with the regularity of the hou&s;es, and is an addi|tional beauty to them, but trees are no ornament here.</P>
<P>When, we &s;aid there was no commerce carried on in this place, we &s;hould have excepted one article, and that the mo&s;t liberal of all other articles of com|merce, namely the commerce of books. This is the great mart for literature, particularly French, of all Holland, if not of all Europe. Great quantities of
<PB N="299" REF="313">
books in quires are exported from hence all over Germany, as well as to England and France. The Dutch editions of French books are in general in more e&s;teem than the French, as being printed better, and on a better paper, and what is more material than all, more carefully revi&s;ed, and therefore freer from the errors of the pre&s;s than the &s;ame works printed in other countries. What is it that &s;tamps &s;uch a value on the <HI>Elzevir</HI> editions at this pre&s;ent time, particu|larly the editions of the cla&s;&s;ics, but that they are not only very neatly but al&s;o very correctly printed; &s;o that &s;carce a &s;ingle error of the pre&s;s is to be found by the mo&s;t di&s;cerning eye, throughout any of their works?</P>
<P>This town, con&s;iderable as it is, never had a voice among the &s;ix in the &s;enate, nor among the twelve that have been added &s;ince, though Purmerend and Schiedam, two incon&s;iderable places, have votes, for which no other rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned than that the Hague was always con&s;idered as a village, though the mo&s;t beautiful and large&s;t in the world. <HI>Tacitus</HI> men|tions &s;ome groves here in which <HI>Claudius Civilis</HI> a&s;&s;em|bled the people, and made an harangue to them. <HI>Guicciardini</HI> has likewi&s;e taken notice of &s;ome ancient &s;culptures and other things relating to <HI>Adrian, Anto|ninus, Septimus Severus,</HI> and other Roman emperors. Whil&s;t Holland was under the Spani&s;h juri&s;diction, the trea&s;ury and other public offices were here kept.
<PB N="300" REF="314">
The air of this place is &s;aid to be very whole&s;ome. Sir <HI>William Temple</HI> attributes longer life to the in|habitants of this village, than to tho&s;e of any other place in Holland.</P>
<P>Near the Hague are two or three other places which attract the attention of &s;trangers; the fir&s;t is Schevel|ing, the road to which through the &s;and-banks is curious. This is a plea&s;ant little village about two miles from the Hague, on the &s;ea-co&s;t. The road to it is paved, as we have already ob&s;erved, and &s;haded with double rows of lime trees and benches at different di&s;tances to &s;it down upon. To this place people go to eat fi&s;h, fre&s;h caught, and admire the beauty of the pro&s;pect, as people in London occa&s;ionally make parties of plea&s;ure to Greenwich and Blackwall to eat while-bait. This coa&s;t is likewi&s;e very well worth &s;eeing, to remark the attention of the Dutch in keeping up their banks, to prevent the depredations of the &s;ea upon their country.</P>
<P>On this beach, which is very flat and regular, the famous &s;ailing chariot of <HI>Stevinus</HI> was made trial of, furni&s;hed both with wheels and &s;ails, which carried eight and twenty per&s;ons the a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;tance of forty-two miles in two hours; and once, by an error of the per&s;on who had hold of the rudder, was very near &s;ailing into the &s;ea with a full cargo, which was rather more than they had bargained for.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="315">The great &s;ucce&s;s of this &s;ailing machine has pro|duced many imitators in different parts of Europe; and a hundred &s;chemes for conducting not only car|riages but carts and waggons, and even ploughs by the wind have been attempted. Something u&s;eful, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> might probably be invented, but mathe|maticians wanting money for the&s;e experiments, none of their vi&s;ionary &s;chemes have hitherto been carried in practice.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer, people come down here to bathe; but what is mo&s;t &s;ingular is, that the daughters of the fi&s;her|men take care of their cloaths while they are bathing, and furni&s;h them with cloaths, help to wipe them dry when they come out of the water, without its being thought any &s;candal on either &s;ide; &s;uch is the power of cu&s;tom. Scheveling has already &s;uffered &s;o much from the encroachments of the &s;ea that the church which was once &s;ituated in the centre of the village, is now almo&s;t by the &s;ea-&s;ide.</P>
<P>At the &s;mall di&s;tance of a plea&s;ant walk from the Hague, is the hou&s;e in the wood belonging to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> which in Holland is an object of curio&s;ity; but there is nothing in it that will &s;trike an Engli&s;hman accu&s;tomed to Engli&s;h gardens. In the palace there is a fine &s;aloon with a cupola, and it is richly ornamented with &s;ome very capital paintings by <HI>Rubens, Vanderveldt, Varel&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Schuyr.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="316">The family of the <HI>Bentincks</HI> have al&s;o &s;ome very fine gardens in the Dutch ta&s;te near this place, known by the name of the Portland gardens, which they keep open at all times for the accommodation of &s;trangers, and of the public at large; and the&s;e are almo&s;t the only gardens which are thus publicly open. The eye here is agreeably amu&s;ed by a diver&s;ity of objects to take off from the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the long alleys in the Dutch gardens, (which are here, as in other places, covered with &s;and, carried on in a &s;traight line, and inter&s;ected every in&s;tant by other &s;imilar &s;traight walks) for there is a fine orangery, a grotto, a jet d'eau, a grove, terraces, mounts, parterres, a lake, and a menagery.</P>
<P>Ry&s;wich is another village near the Hague, which mo&s;t &s;trangers vi&s;it, not only to view the palace of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> but as remarkable from its being the &s;pot in which a treaty of peace was concluded in 1697 between England, Germany, Holland, France, and Spain. The palace is the only building of free &s;tone in the Seven United Provinces: it is &s;trongly envel|loped in wood, which darkens every room; this pa&s;|&s;ion of crouding all their hou&s;es with trees and wood is unaccountable in the Dutch. In a hilly bleak country, where wind and plenty of air were evils, one would naturally look for this ta&s;te; but in a dead flat, where the air is apt to &s;tagnate, as well as the water, it is prepo&s;terous. There is nothing in the palace
<PB N="303" REF="317">
worthy of ob&s;ervation, but a few good pictures. In the &s;tate chamber, is an echo which repeats di&s;tinctly at one end of room whatever is &s;aid in a whi&s;per at the other, without tho&s;e who are in the middle being able to comprehend a &s;yllable that is &s;aid.</P>
<P>At Hon&s;laerdyck there is another palace belonging to the Prince, about a mile from the &s;ea, in which there is a gallery of fine pictures, by the fir&s;t ma&s;|ters in the Flemi&s;h &s;chool, among which are a Charles the fir&s;t, by <HI>Vandyke,</HI> a Madona by him, with a Venus, by <HI>Rubens.</HI> This hou&s;e is con&s;idered to be &s;uperior to &s;ome of the famous palaces in Italy. From the back part there is a delightful pro|&s;pect through a plea&s;ant grove, and &s;ome regular plantations of ever-greens, which form a &s;quare of half a mile from each angle to the centre: be|yond this place is an aviary for exotic birds, and a menagery for wild bea&s;ts. The lower rooms of this place have no peculiar ornament, except being neat|ly paved with marble, after the Dutch fa&s;hion; but the room up &s;tairs are magnificent, and the two gal|leries very curious. The prince&s;s's clo&s;et is orna|mented all round with exqui&s;ite japan-work.</P>
<P>To give &s;ome idea, before we entirely quit the Hague, of what may be the expences to a man of fa&s;hion, during a &s;hort &s;tay in this &s;eat of Dutch gaiety and &s;plendor, we &s;hall extract what <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI>
<PB N="304" REF="318">
&s;ays on that &s;ubject. With re&s;pect to an ordinary traveller, they may be brought within a compa&s;s near|ly &s;imilar to what we &s;tated as the u&s;ual routine of expences for &s;trangers unincumbered with carriages and &s;ervants at Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>I was, &s;ays he, at the <HI>Parl&eacute;ment d'Angleterre,</HI> which was the hotel that all per&s;ons of any rank went to. I found it fully an&s;werable to the character I had received of it; for although I was moderate in my bill of fare, yet I could not come off for le&s;s than two regular cour&s;es, and &s;everal &s;orts of excellent wines; indeed, it was to little purpo&s;e to be explicit in giving orders about my meals, for I was &s;erved with a variety whether I cho&s;e it or not. The ex|pences upon an average were about two guineas a|day; but I entertained, &s;ays he, &s;ome per&s;ons of character to whom I had letters of recommendation. There is no &s;atisfaction, he adds, in travelling expen|&s;ively, e&s;pecially in eating and drinking, and &s;uch money is better expended in purcha&s;ing the rarities or peculiar productions of the country, than in &s;quandering away large &s;ums at inns. The&s;e circum|&s;tances he mentions as a hint to other travellers, that may con&s;ider and lay their plan before-hand: for, by not taking private lodgings, and by making a longer &s;tay than he intended, his expences were very heavy.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="319">Tho&s;e who make the tour of Holland from the Hague, proceed thither by the way of Delft or Rot|terdam, the latter of which cities we have noticed; or el&s;e take their route by Leyden, Haerlem, Am&s;terdam and Utrecht, and &s;o take Rotterdam on their return. The&s;e are the principal and mo&s;t populous cities in Holland, or rather in the Dutch Netherlands;&mdash;Utrecht not being in the province of Holland, though all the re&s;t are.</P>
<P>Delft lyes in the road between the Hague and Rot|terdam, about &s;ix miles from the Hague. This is an agreeable place, plea&s;antly &s;ituated among the mea|dows; the &s;treets are &s;pacious, and canals running through them planted with trees. It is about half the &s;ize of Norwich. The principal object in it is the manufactory of earthen ware, and hence called Delft. Their porcelain employs at pre&s;ent about 4,000 people, men, women and children; the manu|facture was once &s;o flouri&s;hing as to employ more than 7,000, but the &s;etting up of a fabric of white &s;tone-ware in England was very prejudicial to it; though not near &s;o much as the Stafford&s;hire cream-coloured ware; this has rivalled the Delft manufac|tory, not only in the Briti&s;h con&s;umption, but even in their own city, to &s;uch a degree, as to have induced the principal manufacturers to make application more than once for a prohibition of it: this has not yet been granted; but very high duties have been laid
<PB N="306" REF="320">
on it; and the u&s;e of it &s;till continuing, they are at|tempting to rival us in the &s;ame manufacture, but hitherto without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Brewing is al&s;o a trade in which the people of Delft are very much engaged, and which &s;ucceeds very well: there was formerly a very con&s;iderable cloth-manufactory here, but rival manufactories in France e&s;tabli&s;ted in the time of <HI>Louis</HI> XIV. have brought it to a low ebb.</P>
<P>There are but two churches in this city, in one of which is the tomb of <HI>Prince William</HI> I. of Orange, the founder of the republic, who was treacherou&s;ly &s;hot in his palace here by an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in in 1584. The place and hole in the wain&s;cot through which the balls pa&s;&s;ed are &s;till &s;hewn. A mo&s;t noble mau&s;o|leum has been erected here to his memory, at the expence of the &s;tates-general. There are two &s;ta|tues of him, one of marble, repo&s;ing on his tomb, which is &s;upported by twenty-two pillars of black marble, and another of bra&s;s &s;tanding near it. On the top is Fame &s;ounding her trumpet, with this motto <HI>Te vindice, tuta libertas.</HI> Under your au&s;pices &s;hall freedom flouri&s;h. At his feet lyes his little dog, which is &s;aid to have pined away, and died with grief for the lo&s;s of his ma&s;ter, <HI>(&s;ee the plate.)</HI>&mdash;This church is now the burial place of the Princes of Orange. The a&s;hes of the celebrated <HI>Grotius</HI> are
<PB N="307" REF="321">
likewi&s;e repo&s;ed here. Surely this man merited a &s;tatue of bra&s;s in the great &s;quare of Rotterdam, much more than <HI>Era&s;mus.</HI> Po&s;&s;ibly his works con|taining more &s;ound and deep learning, with le&s;s buf|foonry than tho&s;e of the other, were above the com|prehen&s;ion of Dutchmen. In the other church is a &s;tately marble monument to the famous admiral <HI>Van Tromp.</HI> This city is likewi&s;e &s;aid to have given birth to the celebrated <HI>Hein&s;ius.</HI> In the hotel-de-ville, a fine gothic building, is a machine in the form of a clog, which u&s;ed to be put about the neck of per&s;ons convicted of adultery.</P>
<P>The commerce of this place, as has been already remarked, is not &s;o con&s;iderable as formerly, and it is now the retreat of wealthy merchants; who have probably been induced to come here from its cen|trical &s;ituation, the &s;alubrity of the air, its vicinity to the &s;ea, the continued verdure with which it is on every &s;ide &s;urrounded, and its being a large, clean and quiet town, unaccompanied with noi&s;e and bu&s;tle.</P>
<P>About as far to the &s;outh of the Hague as Delft is to the north, or &s;omething more, lyes the city of Leyden, e&s;teemed the large&s;t and fine&s;t town in Hol|land, next to Am&s;terdam. It is &s;eated in a country full of gardens and meadows, and &s;urrounded with a great number of ditches and canals, near the an|cient
<PB N="308" REF="322">
bed of the Rhine, which now looks like a ca|nal. It is about four miles in circumference, and its ditches are bordered with rows of trees. This town is unque&s;tionably one of the neate&s;t and plea&s;ante&s;t in the Low Countries; and though it may be going too far to &s;ay, it is the large&s;t town in Holland next to Am&s;terdam; yet Rotterdam is the only town be&s;ides, that comes in competition with it. The buildings are beautiful and magnificent, the &s;treets &s;pacious and very clean, with canals in the middle of many of them, the &s;ides of which are planted with rows of trees. The Rapenburg &s;treet is a very noble one; and, as the inhabitants &s;uppo&s;e, the fine&s;t in Europe. The great church is a va&s;t building, but mo&s;t remark|able for being the burial place of the great <HI>Boerhaave.</HI> The in&s;cription on his monument is &s;imple and no|ble. <HI>Salutifero Boerhaavii genio &s;acrum.</HI> "Sacred to the health-re&s;toring genius of <HI>Boerhaave."</HI> Had not the family of this illu&s;trious Hollander been rich enough to pay this tribute to his memory, there would be nothing here to &s;hew that this town had the greate&s;t phy&s;ician that ever lived &s;ince <HI>Hippo|crates.</HI> If a naval officer di&s;tingui&s;hes him&s;elf ever &s;o little, he is honoured with a public funeral; but tho&s;e who contribute to enlighten the human mind by deep re&s;earches, go unnoticed. In the church of St. Mary there is a monument of <HI>Jo&s;eph Scaliger,</HI> and another of <HI>Elu&s;ius</HI> the herbali&s;t.&mdash;The &s;tadthou&s;e pre&s;ents nothing worthy of ob&s;ervation, but a picture
<PB N="309" REF="323">
by <HI>Luke</HI> of Leyden, of the la&s;t judgement. It is &s;aid, this is the fir&s;t painter who had any idea of per&s;pective. He died in 1533.</P>
<P>But what has rendered this city famous all over Europe, is its univer&s;ity. It undoubtedly has pro|duced many great and very able men, But this, like their commerce, appears on the deline. Whoever expects to &s;ee magnificent colleges, or pompous heads of hou&s;es, will here be mi&s;erably di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>They have only two colleges, in the nature of ho&s;|pitals, for the &s;upport of poor &s;cholars, the re&s;t of the &s;tudents living at their own expence; they wear no gowns or caps, but walk about the &s;treets with their &s;words on, and appear in the &s;chools and perform their exerci&s;es with them on, and their heads un|covered. Tho&s;e who wi&s;h to be members of the univer&s;ity apply to the <HI>Rector Magnificus,</HI> corre|&s;ponding with our vice-chancellor, who enters their name in the univer&s;ity book; for which half-a-crown or five &s;hillings is paid, which entitles the &s;tudent to a certain quantity of wine and beer without paying exci&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the public lecture, the profe&s;&s;ors allot cer|tain hours for reading private ones; the&s;e la&s;t about three months, for which the &s;cholars pay forty or fifty guilders, though they &s;eldom are much &s;uperior
<PB N="310" REF="324">
to the lectures of our private tutors. They com|monly dictate in Latin, which is oftentimes not le&s;s ob&s;cure than the &s;ubject of the lecture.</P>
<P>Degrees are not regulated here either by time or merit; if the &s;tudent can make a <HI>the&s;is,</HI> and pay his fees, he may be admitted. His <HI>the&s;is</HI> he is, <HI>pro form&acirc;,</HI> obliged to maintain in the &s;chool again&s;t any oppo|nent. The degrees of doctor and ma&s;ters of arts are the only ones in u&s;e among them; that of batchelor being not known here. The graduates give public entertainments, and publi&s;h their <HI>the&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;everal faculties publi&s;h their <HI>&s;eries lectionum,</HI> containing the times when, and the &s;ubjects upon which they are to read in public. Some of them have two hundred, others three hun|dred per annum.</P>
<P>The &s;chools con&s;i&s;t of a large pile of brick build|ings, in the uppermo&s;t rooms of which the famous <HI>Elzevir</HI> had his printing office. They have a library &s;aid to contain &s;ome curious manu&s;cripts; but neither their library, their phy&s;ic-garden, nor their collection of natural hi&s;tory, pre&s;ents any thing very intere&s;ting to the generality of travellers, of all which they &s;eem to make great boa&s;t in Holland. It was a remark of the late Doctor <HI>John&s;on,</HI> that &s;ome judgment might be formed of the &s;tate of literature in any
<PB N="311" REF="325">
town, from the book&s;ellers &s;hops. If this criterion holds good with re&s;pect to Leyden, literature will appear at a very low ebb there; the collection of books to be met with in that city being in general but very indifferent, and mo&s;tly confined to medical &s;ubjects. This univer&s;ity is the olde&s;t in the United Netherlands; and was founded by <HI>William</HI> I. Prince of Orange.</P>
<P>As this city &s;eems to be on the decline in its litera|ture, &s;o it is in its woollen manufactures (the &s;taple commodity of this city,) and which were formerly much more con&s;iderable than at pre&s;ent. The work|men con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal nations, particularly French. Their fabrics employ at pre&s;ent &s;everal thou&s;and men, women and children; chie&s;ly making broad and nar|row cloths, &s;erges and camlets; but they are inferior, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> to the fine&s;t cloths of the &s;ame kind in England. Their camlets and rattines, however, are greatly &s;uperior to tho&s;e made at Bru&s;&s;els, which al|ways have been held in high e&s;timation; and there are two colours to which they are &s;uppo&s;ed to give a &s;upe|rior dye, to any other country whatever&mdash;black, and particularly blue. The French are &s;uppo&s;ed to equal them in their black, but the Leyden blue &s;tands as yet unrivalled every where. Their cloths they export to Spain, Turkey, and the Ea&s;t-Indies; in which countries they have the preference over ours; not from their being better in quality, but from their

being cheaper. Among other rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for their trade being on the decline, one is, that the princes in Germany, who formerly cloathed their ar|mies entirely with Dutch cloth, have lately &s;upplied them&s;elves from manufactures of their own, which they had e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>A great trade is carried on here in garden-&s;tuff, which is in &s;uch e&s;teem as to be carried as far as Am|&s;terdam, to &s;upply the markets there. Their gardens are &s;aid to produce four or five crops every year; and it is further &s;aid, that an acre of garden ground is worth two hundred and fifty pounds, purcha&s;e-money; and arable, two hundred pounds, and an acre of meadow land, an hundred and forty pounds.</P>
<P>This city likewi&s;e is famous for being the birth|place of <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Leyden,</HI> who in 1534, &s;et up to be a king; his followers were a kind of anabapti&s;ts, who committed many outrages; but the following year they were puni&s;hed for their ra&s;hne&s;s and rebellion; and <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf was broken upon the wheel. This <HI>John</HI> of Leyden was a taylor, and in the hall where the taylors meet, is &s;hewn the board, which he u&s;ed to cut out his cloth.</P>
<P>Not far from this place, at the village called Cath|wich, near the &s;ea, are the ruins of an ancient fortre&s;s, known by the name of <HI>Arx Britannica,</HI> which being
<PB N="313" REF="327">
built by <HI>Cabjala,</HI> and afterwards de&s;troyed by the Normans, was at la&s;t overwhelmed by the &s;ea; yet not &s;o much, but that at certain times when the &s;ea is very low, its ruins are plainly to be &s;een; and &s;ome antiquities have been found with this in&s;cription, <HI>Ex. Ger. Inf. Ex Germania Inferiori.</HI> From Lower Ger|many.</P>
<P>The only remaining city to be noticed in this pro|vince, is Haerlem, fifteen miles di&s;tant from Leyden, and nine from Am&s;terdam; with which two cities it enjoys a communication, by means of two &s;pacious canals. The views of the country between Leyden and Haerlem, are by no means unplea&s;ant, though there is a range of va&s;t turf pits, and the lake of Haer|lem on one &s;ide; but the other is much diver&s;ified with meadows, fed principally with black, cattle. The lake is twelve miles long, and three broad, lying be|tween Am&s;terdam, Leyden, and Haerlem; there is a very con&s;iderable commerce on it, &s;o that it is finely &s;pread with &s;ails. This lake yields great quantities of fi&s;h. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that little jealou&s;ies between the three great cities near this river, &s;hould prevent their agreeing, in a work &s;o very advantageous to the country, as draining and converting this lake into a rich meadow would be. The water is in no places more than eight feet deep, and all of it could be con|veyed away at a &s;mall expence, and the whole &s;pace kept perfectly dry. The Dutch all agree that it is
<PB N="314" REF="328">
practicable; but three cities above-mentioned, can|not agree together about doing it.</P>
<P>Haerlem, like other Dutch cities, has a &s;how of fortifications, but there are none that could hold out any &s;iege. The &s;treets are wide and &s;traight, but the hou&s;es have nothing in them to attract notice. There are many canals here: as to the number of inhabi|tants, they are reckoned at fifty thou&s;and. The prin|cipal church is a very fine &s;tructure; it has three or|gans, one of which is &s;o celebrated, that it is u&s;ual for per&s;ons of fa&s;hion and fond of mu&s;ic, to pay a ducat, the e&s;tabli&s;hed fee, to hear a few airs played upon it. And they &s;hew in this church &s;ome cannon balls, that are now &s;ticking in the walls, which were &s;hot into it by the Spaniards during the time of di|vine &s;ervice, in the famous &s;iege of 1572. In the roof are hung up the models of two ve&s;&s;els with &s;aws to their keel, which were &s;ent by the people of Haer|lem, to the &s;iege of Damiette, on the confines of Egypt, to cut the chain which &s;topped the navigation up the Nile; by effecting which they delivered one of their counts of Holland, who was kept pri&s;oner there, under the reign of <HI>Barbaro&s;&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>In memory of this extraordinary action, the young men of this town celebrate the fir&s;t of January, and carry little boats about, &s;haped like the &s;hips in the church; they boa&s;t that <HI>Barbaro&s;&s;a,</HI> in con&s;ideration of
<PB N="315" REF="329">
the &s;ignal &s;ervices done by the people of Haerlem in the holy war, added the &s;word to the arms of this city, and the Partriarch of Jeru&s;alem be&s;towed the cro&s;s upon it.</P>
<P>Haerlem likewi&s;e boa&s;ts the invention of printing by one <HI>Laurence Co&s;ter,</HI> who, as <HI>Guicciardini</HI> &s;ays, walking one day in one of the groves, of which they have &s;everal about this place, cut &s;ome letters from the bark he had peeled from the trees, and &s;tamping them, inverted on a piece of paper; he found them to come right; then rubbing them over with ink, it produced &s;omething like a letter, though &s;omewhat blotted; however being encouraged by this rough draught, he cut regular letters on better materials, which being dipped into a more glutinous ink, by re|peated improvements, he brought it at la&s;t to perfec|tion. They &s;ay, one of his &s;ervants robbed him of all his in&s;truments, and went with them to Mayence, or Mentz, which is the rea&s;on that city di&s;putes this in|vention with Haerlem. His picture with the letter A in his hand, and drawn with a furred gown, is to be &s;een in the Prince's garden. They likewi&s;e &s;hew a piece of <HI>Co&s;ter</HI>'s fir&s;t printing, the impre&s;&s;ions only on one &s;ide, as they u&s;ed to print their fir&s;t originals.</P>
<P>The gardens of this city merit much being &s;een: they are all almo&s;t in the Fauxbourgs. It is the hyacinths which are now the prevailing flowers; for|merly
<PB N="316" REF="330">
the preference was given to the tulip. Though the price of the roots is very much dimini&s;hed, &s;ome at pre&s;ent will &s;ell for a hundred florins a root; for|merly five hundred pounds have been given for a &s;ingle root of yellow hyacinth, but this was before they were general, fancy alone con&s;tituting the great di&s;tinc|tion between them. Next to the hyacinth, they value mo&s;t the tulip: next, the anemony, then the narci&s;|&s;us, and then the auricula: other choice flowers, which &s;ome nations pride them&s;elves in, are here in no e&s;teem. The bulbous flowers are exported all over Europe.</P>
<P>The objects mo&s;t worthy of notice in this neigh|bourhood, are the manufactures of the bleach-ground; the principal trade is bleaching linen; large quanti|ties that have been made in other provinces, in Flan|ders, and in Sile&s;ia, are brought to Haerlem, to be bleached: whole &s;hip-loads have even been brought here, from Scotland and Ireland, for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e. It is the quality of the water alone, which bleaches the linen in this place, &s;o much better than in any other. Repeated trials have been made in Scotland and Ireland, where Dutch bleachers have been employed, without their having the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. Let it be remembered, however, that the whiter any cloth is made, &s;o much the le&s;s time it will wear; this extraordinary fine bleaching &s;hould therefore be con|fined to &s;uch cloths, as are intended for the u&s;e of the
<PB N="317" REF="331">
rich. The charge of freight to and from Scotland, with the price of bleaching, amounts to about ten|pence a yard, which would be a very great addition in the price of any but very fine linens.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this branch of trade, there are &s;everal con&s;i|derable manufactures, particularly of velvet, dama&s;ks, &s;atins, &s;ilk &s;tuffs of various &s;orts; thread, tape, &amp;c. In all which a great number of hands are employed; and I was here told, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> that their fabrics had been increa&s;ing for &s;ome years, but that their bleaching trade was on the decline.</P>
<P>Weavers, upon an average, will earn here, near half-a-guinea a week. From different accounts of the number of hands employed in all the manufactures, it appears there are from thirty, to upwards of forty thou&s;and; but there are many of them employed by &s;ome very con&s;iderable breweries, which work for ex|portation.</P>
<P>In all this part of the province of Holland, &s;carce any arable land is to be &s;een: their meadow land is very rich, and will let from forty &s;hillings, to &s;ix pounds an Engli&s;h acre. This land is principally applied to the feeding of cows, which are of a very large breed; in the management of them, the pea&s;ants are remark|ably attentive; they keep them clothed all the winter, and as clean as an Engli&s;h gentleman would a &s;table
<PB N="318" REF="332">
of hunters. This is not effected by the means of lit|ter, for they u&s;e none. A trench of &s;tone or brick, is made in the floor of the cow-room, in &s;uch a man|ner that the dung may fall directly into it, and which being &s;wept away with the dirt of the re&s;t of the hou&s;e, forms a good compo&s;t; and a &s;aving of &s;traw in a part of the country where there is no arable land, is an ob|ject of no &s;mall importance. They be&s;ides, dre&s;s and rub down their cows, as we do our hor&s;es, which they think will make them give the more milk; they like|wi&s;e keep their cow-hou&s;es as warm as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;top every crevice, till the breath of the bea&s;ts makes the whole place perfectly warm. This is a &s;trange cu&s;tom, and appears contrary to nature; but they car|ry this notion &s;o far of keeping their cows warm, that they even put cloths over their loins, whil&s;t they are feeding in the fields in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;tures are likewi&s;e fed by large herds of black cattle, which the Dutch drivers purcha&s;e in Hol&s;tein and Denmark, for forty or fifty &s;hillings a|head, and &s;ell to the farmers here for three or four pounds; and it is ob&s;ervable that their meadows are &s;o rich, that &s;ome of the bea&s;ts will be fattened in &s;ix weeks time. The butchers buy them fat from five to nine pounds a-head: and as an Engli&s;h acre will fat|ten three, the farmer makes from three to &s;ix pounds an acre, for only part of the year.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="333">It is a&s;&s;erted the fle&s;h of their oxen is not &s;o firm, nor their hides &s;o capable of making good leather, as tho&s;e of Engli&s;h cattle: this is owing to the luxuriance of the food, puffing them up in &s;o &s;hort a time, rather than giving them that &s;olid fat, which &s;ix or eight months effect in England; it is accordingly ob&s;erved, that though &s;ome of the&s;e bea&s;ts are as large as the Engli&s;h ones, yet they will not equal them in weight.</P>
<P>As the Dutch eat very little fre&s;h beef, the greate&s;t part is &s;alted for the &s;hipping, or dried and &s;moaked in a peculiar manner for hung beef, which they &s;end all over Europe.</P>
<P>Land in the neighbourhood of Leyden, &s;ells dearer than in any other part of Europe, when applied to cultivation, and not to building on. Arable land, as has been ob&s;erved before, will fetch 200l. an acre: and garden ground from 250 to even 300; the pro|ducts they yield being highly valued by the Gour|mands at Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>The gardeners are very &s;kilful in cropping their lands continually, on the plan now pur&s;ued in the gardens round London; where this art is carried to as high perfection as in any quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>The general fertility the country is owing to the &s;oil, and to its being &s;o well watered; for from the
<PB N="320" REF="334">
general flatne&s;s of the whole country, its vicinity to the &s;ea, and its numerous rivers, this country is evidently a drained mar&s;h or bog; it being all either a fat marly loam, mud, or a turf bog: the&s;e are rich &s;oils, and with the advantage of cattle, and having al|ways water to have recour&s;e to, which the Dutch boors e&s;teem a matter of great con&s;equence both to fattening cattle, and making them give large quantities of milk; they produce the wonders that are &s;een in this country. Much therefore is owing to the number of canals and rivers that inter&s;ect the meadows; and probably to their overflowing large tracks of land in winter, and leaving behind advantages, it may be pre|&s;umed parallel to tho&s;e which are left by the Nile.</P>
<P>Among the rivers it is very well known, that the Rhine is very incon&s;iderable. At Leyden an in&s;igni|ficant canal is &s;hewn which is the real Rhine. The glory of other rivers increa&s;es proportionably to the length of their cour&s;e; but this dwindles to nothing, and is utterly lo&s;t before it comes to its harbour.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of the Rhine's fate was an earthquake, which &s;hook the Downs in the ninth century, and fill|ing the mouth of this river, forced it to return and &s;eek a new pa&s;&s;age. The river Seck was then &s;carce worth notice; but the waters of the Rhine which were
<PB N="321" REF="335">
driven back and overflowed the country; &s;welled and deepened the Leek's channel, and the entrance of the &s;ea has been ever &s;ince &s;hut up, again&s;t the ancient cour&s;e of the Rhine.</P>
<P>Thus, this poor river which runs &s;uch hazards in the lake of Con&s;tance, and throws it&s;elf down a precipice near Schaff hau&s;en, lo&s;es at length its reputation, and waters, at the village of Caturik.</P>
<P>Before we quit the neighbourhood of the Hague, and Leyden, which are reckoned the polite&s;t places in all the provinces, and the mo&s;t learned; one being the &s;eat of government, and re&s;idence of the foreign mini&s;ters, and the other an univer&s;ity and the &s;eat of &s;ciences, and literature; we will beg leave to offer &s;ome few remarks on the character of the people in this part of the United Netherlands.</P>
<P>Among the lower cla&s;&s;es of people, there is a very great national re&s;emblance throughout all the pro|vinces; but among the better &s;ort, who &s;upport them|&s;elves without trade, and who have travelled, the&s;e are all more or le&s;s French. They &s;peak that language only, they dre&s;s in the French ta&s;te, eat in like man|ner, and give them&s;elves (particularly young men of any fa&s;hion in Holland) the &s;ame airs, as if they aped French liveline&s;s and vivacity. People of this de&s;crip|tion are not uncommon at the Hague; this place not
<PB N="322" REF="336">
being &s;upported by trade, but rather the re&s;idence of idlene&s;s than indu&s;try; and being full of foreigners, it may account for this motley appearance of characters, which we find in the inhabitants of that city. It is likewi&s;e worth remarking, that there is &s;omething of the character of a Frenchified Dutchman to be ob&s;er|ved at Leyden, though not &s;o much as at the Hague, But at Rotterdam there is a vi&s;ible difference. This plainly &s;hews that the characters and manners of the people are very much formed, by their clo&s;e adher|ing to or neglecting bu&s;ine&s;s. A Dutch Burgoma&s;ter, or principal freeman, dre&s;&s;es in a formal &s;uit of black, and his lady in a hoop every way &s;haped like a bell, with a laced coif, worth 100l. whil&s;t the daughter &s;hall be tricked out in every French fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>At Leyden the Univer&s;ity draws a great number of per&s;ons who have no views of trade, and who there|fore affect the appearance and manners of the inhabi|tants; but at Rotterdam every individual is deeply engaged in commerce, and therefore exhibits the true Dutch character much more to the life.</P>
<P>An un&s;haken indu&s;try &s;eems to be the &s;trong cha|racteri&s;tic features of this city; no application wearies them, no accidents divert them; their whole atten|tion is directed to the rai&s;ing of wealth; and it is not a little &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee the numbers who have attain|ed large fortunes, and yet continue the &s;ame anxiety
<PB N="323" REF="337">
and eagerne&s;s after more, without thinking to enjoy what they have already acquired. Their con&s;titutions are cold and phlegmatic to an amazing degree; a &s;ober regular, par&s;imonious way of life, is habitual to them, and no pa&s;&s;ion &s;eems to lurk in their bo&s;om that can ruffle them. This, however, cannot be attributed to their love of trade, &s;o much as to their climate.</P>
<P>A Dutchman is as amphibious as a frog, &s;ays <HI>Mar|&s;hal;</HI> half their country is water, and half their time is &s;pent upon it. The vapours which ari&s;e from the quantity of water with which they are &s;urrounded, and from a &s;oil which is low, moi&s;t, and boggy, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily affect the mind of its inhabitants. What an a&s;toni&s;hing contra&s;t between love in Spain or Italy, and love in Holland! Would it not be amazing to tell a Neapolitan <HI>inamorato,</HI> that the height of his fine phrenzy was mere climate; and that if he lived in Holland, he would look upon his mi&s;tre&s;s with the colde&s;t friend&s;hip!</P>
<P>But the&s;e characteri&s;tics are not general; there are and mu&s;t be many exceptions. Many of the mer|chants and manufacturers live genteelly; and though not all in the French &s;tyle, yet in much ea&s;e, plenty, and affluence, while they attend to trade as clo&s;ely as if no &s;uch external marks of riches were to be &s;een among them. They are fond of indulging in the lux|uries of the table, in expen&s;ive furniture, and hand|&s;ome
<PB N="324" REF="338">
equipages; but as for dre&s;s, amu&s;ements, and a variety of &s;ervants, they are totally indifferent about them.</P>
<P>The true national character, unmixed, mu&s;t be &s;ought for among the lower cla&s;s; in them are to be found the &s;ame coldne&s;s of con&s;titution, with no in|vigoration than what beer, gin and tobacco give, which they take in great quantities. In them is like|wi&s;e to be &s;een a rough boori&s;hne&s;s, which is not to be met with in other countries. The very lowe&s;t of the people will not pay the lea&s;t mark of per&s;onal re&s;pect to the greate&s;t merchant: this is the effect of that equality which flows through a republic, and not mere liberty; for they are governed with three times the &s;everity in this country, that the lower people in England are.</P>
<P>The following anecdote will illu&s;trate this. After the elector Palatine, King of Bohemia, who married the daughter of James I. and from whom the kings on the Briti&s;h throne are de&s;cended&mdash;after this king had been routed at the battle of Prague, he fled to Holland. This was in the year 1520, about forty years after the Dutch had thrown off the Spani&s;h yoke, and when a &s;pirit of equality had taken hold of the people in general; the king with &s;ome few attendants was out a cour&s;ing, and riding incautiou&s;ly over a field that had ju&s;t been &s;owed, the farmer and

<HEAD>DUTCH LIBERTY.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="325" REF="340">
one of his pea&s;ants who had been thre&s;hing in the barn, &s;eeing the king riding on the land, quitted their work, and ran out to him with the utmo&s;t an|ger. "Hollo!" cried the farmer, who knew the per|&s;on of the king, "Hollo! you King of Bohemia,&mdash; what do you mean by riding over my land?"&mdash;The king more &s;urpri&s;ed than afraid, &s;topped his hor&s;e, made an apology, and returned.</P>
<P>The lower &s;ort of Dutch have been reproached with being pa&s;&s;ionate, that they draw their knives on each other, and in their in&s;urrections are very barbarous; but this &s;carce ever happens but when they are too free in their u&s;e of gin.&mdash;We will now proceed to North Holland.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP III.</HI> North Holland, or We&s;t Frie&s;land.</HEAD>
<P>THIS forms a penin&s;ula; it being almo&s;t &s;urround|ed by the north and Zuyder &s;eas, and is con|nected only by an i&s;thmus with South Holland.&mdash; They are both under one regency, called the States of Holland and We&s;t-Frie&s;land, though the appel|lation of We&s;t-Frie&s;land belongs more properly to the northern part of this country.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="341">There are a great many very high dykes or &s;and|hills in this part of Holland, but the other parts of the country lye very low. It was formerly over-run with wa&s;hes or mar&s;hes, but the per&s;evering inhabi|tants have drained them, and they are now very fine meadow grounds; though it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep up a great number of wind-mills to carry off the waters occa&s;ionally, which is attended with con&s;iderable ex|pence.</P>
<P>Sardam, the town much vi&s;ited by &s;trangers, near Am&s;terdam, though a village, in neatne&s;s has not its equal in all Europe, and for the con&s;iderable trade that it carries on.</P>
<P>It is the principal place for &s;hip-building in all the provinces; and when the Dutch navy was at the height of its pro&s;perity, was noted for a &s;aying, That if you gave the people &s;ix months notice, they could launch a man of war every day in the year.</P>
<P>Here are at pre&s;ent large magazines of timber, ma&s;ts, yards, cordage, &s;ails, anchors, cannon, and every thing nece&s;&s;ary to build, rig and fit out, all &s;orts of ve&s;&s;els: but this place is not only noted for &s;hip-building; there are a great many manufactures carried on here, particularly of aper; this being the mo&s;t con&s;iderable paper manufactory in all the Netherlands, and employing above &s;ix hundred men, be&s;ides women
<PB N="327" REF="342">
and children; the men earn about &s;even &s;hillings per week, on an average, but &s;ome of them get much more. The&s;e wages &s;eem to be about equal to tho&s;e given by the &s;ame manufactures in England, but living here is much dearer, which is compen&s;ated by the &s;uperior frugality and &s;obriety of the Dutch.</P>
<P>The number of wind-mills at this place is a&s;toni&s;h|ing. <HI>Bu&s;ching</HI> makes them to be no fewer than twen|ty-three hundred.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e for &s;awing timber to build their &s;hips with, are admirable contrivances; they facilitate the work &s;o much, that it is greatly to be regretted, that they are not imitated in England. Such a &s;aw-mill indeed was erected &s;ome years &s;ince at Limehou&s;e, but the &s;awyers who dreaded a lo&s;s of employ, aro&s;e in a body, and pulled it down.</P>
<P>The Dutch have had them above 140 years, and yet in England they continue u&s;ing the hand-&s;aw, which is forty times the expence; the rea&s;on alledged is, if mills were generally introduced, a great number of &s;awyers would at once be out of employ; but it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch &s;tout and able men as faw|yers could remain without work; and the cheapne&s;s of the manufactures u&s;ing mills, would make the con|&s;umption &s;o much the greater, that all the hands de|pendent on them would be increa&s;ed. This was found
<PB N="328" REF="343">
to be the ca&s;e in Holland, and particularly in Sardam; where the erecting &s;aw-mills increa&s;ed, as appears by authentic regi&s;ters, the number of &s;hip-wrights, in the proportion of twenty to one.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o many mills for grinding wood and colours, &s;uch as the dyers u&s;e; and likewi&s;e a great number of powder-mills, of which there is a large ma|nufactory carried on: all the&s;e mills make Sardam a very con&s;iderable place, and their &s;tructure is &s;o ex|ceedingly curious, that a &s;tranger will find no greater entertainment any where in Holland, or &s;tronger in|citements to reflection on the indu&s;try of the Dutch, and the great national benefit ari&s;ing from their fruga|lity, and their ingenious contrivances for lowering the prices of their manufactures, than in this village. This was the place in which the great <HI>Czar Peter</HI> worked as a common &s;hip-wright, and the tools he u&s;ed to work with, are &s;till &s;hewn. It is about &s;even miles from Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>Near Eidam is a track of country, of more than twenty miles in circumference, called Purmerend, the name of a lake which was here formerly, but which is now entirely drained, and covered with rich meadows. The &s;oil is a rich, black loam, compo&s;ed, to all ap|pearance, of &s;and and clay, but more like a &s;lime &s;ettled; the gra&s;s is admirably rich, but full of weeds, the Dutch having no notion of meadows well-laid
<PB N="329" REF="344">
out; the luxuriance of the herbage is all that they attend to, in order to have (what is called in England) a great &s;warth of hay. Yet the&s;e meadows let from 40s. to 5l. an acre Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>This fertility &s;hews what is to be expected from drained lakes. There is no in&s;tance of this in England; yet the moors in Huntingdon and Cambridge&s;hire, and the lakes in Scotland, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> would &s;urely ad|mit of this culture. Larger cows and &s;heep than are to be met with here, are no where to be &s;een; the&s;e cows will give four or five gallons of milk, Engli&s;h mea&s;ure, in a day; and the chee&s;e and butter made from one of them, amounts to about eight pounds &s;terling a-year.</P>
<P>This track of land is, on the whole, one of the greate&s;t curo&s;ities in the United Provinces. It was drained in the year 1612, and the whole completely fini&s;hed in four years. The lake contained 10,000 acres, of which 7,000 are now made profitable as meadows, orchards, or gardens; the remaining 3,000 compo&s;e villages, roads, dykes, canals, drains, &amp;c. The appearance is as beautiful as that of a dead flat can be; the verdure is fine; the fences perfectly neat, the rows of trees, the orc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ards and the gardens nume|rous and thriving; in &s;hort, a richer &s;pot is hardly to be &s;een. The rents are very high, but the fertility of the &s;oil merits it; for here are many meadows that
<PB N="330" REF="345">
will more than feed a large cow, per acre, and &s;up|port her all the &s;ummer with great plenty.</P>
<P>A Dutch boor, with fifty or &s;ixty acres, will con|trive to live as well or better than an Engli&s;h far|mer with two hundred acres; this is entirely owing to their &s;pirit of frugality and neatne&s;s. It is not only vi&s;ible in their hou&s;es and furniture, but in all their farming offices. Their tools and implements are kept in the mo&s;t exact order; their &s;cythes, &s;pades, &s;hovels and forks appear like hou&s;ehold in&s;truments: their waggons are con&s;tantly kept as clean as our coaches, and this &s;pirit of cleanline&s;s runs through every thing. Though this certainly takes up time, it an&s;wers to them very well in the end; for there is a great difference in the wear and tare of any tools or in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, whether they are kept clean and under cover, or dirty and expo&s;ed to the weather: from which I conclude, &s;ays <HI>Mar&s;hal,</HI> that no time is better &s;pent than that which is employed in keep|ing all the implements, and every thing relative to hu&s;bandry, neat and clean.</P>
<P>This is particularly ob&s;ervable in Holland, not only in their implements of hu&s;bandry, but in their cattle, their fences, the banks of their ditches, their dykes, their walls, poles, hedges, &amp;c. whatever the fence is, one is &s;ure to find it in good order; and this is
<PB N="331" REF="346">
equally con&s;picuous in all their public works; the ca|nals, bridges, dykes, &amp;c. are all in admirable repair.</P>
<P>So great is the economy of the Dutch, and &s;o much do they live within their income, that they ne|ver know the want of money; being thus rich, they will contribute as freely to the erection or repair of a publick building, as to the fences in their own gardens.</P>
<P>Next to Sardam, the village of Broek is one of the mo&s;t curious in Holland, as well as the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. The extreme neatne&s;s which reigns there, is unexampled even in the re&s;t of the pro|vinces. The inhabitants are very rich, and &s;ome of them can give their daughters &s;everal tons of gold for their portion. The hou&s;es here are all built of timber, and &s;eldom exceed one &s;tory high. They are &s;o frequently painted, that they always look as if they were ju&s;t built. The windows are in general &s;a&s;hed and decorated with beautiful curtains. The in&s;ide al&s;o of their hou&s;es is neat, and embelli&s;hed beyond conception. Tho&s;e who have ever &s;o &s;mall a portion of ground before their hou&s;e, never fail to convert it into an agreeable garden diver&s;ified with gravel walks, &s;hell-work, images, and little hegdes or painted rails. The village it&s;elf is watered by a number of canals, the banks of which are kept up with the greate&s;t neatne&s;s; and all the &s;treets
<PB N="332" REF="347">
are paved with bricks, which are kept frequently wa&s;hed and &s;trewed with white &s;and; in &s;ome places the bricks are di&s;per&s;ed in the form of flowers. That the&s;e ornaments may not be defaced, or the &s;treets made dirty, no carriages or hor&s;es are per|mitted to pa&s;s through them. There is but one public hou&s;e at the entrance of the village, and which is the only one that &s;trangers are admitted to &s;ee, if they have no acquaintance among the inhabitants. When any &s;trangers come there, they are &s;o jealous at the &s;ight of them, that tho&s;e who have daughters, who are in general very hand&s;ome, make them keep out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Not only the wooden furniture in the hou&s;es are painted to the very broom-&s;ticks, but likewi&s;e the gates and rails in the meadows, and even the very po&s;ts in the meadows, the latter of which are fur|ther ornamented with carved work.</P>
<P>At Alamaar, which is the chief town in North Holland, there is a very &s;ingular charity. A con|&s;iderable e&s;tate has been left for the &s;upport of old maids and widows, no matter of what religion, pro|vided they will take an oath never to marry. This city is &s;urrounded by a great number of gardens, or|chards and rich meadows; and very near it there is a grove, which would make a figure in the be&s;t regu|lar garden in England, it is &s;o beautiful. The &s;treets
<PB N="333" REF="348">
of this city are regular and well built, and the large canals kept &s;o clean, that they give the town an elegant appearance. In 1732 it was found to con|tain 2,581 hou&s;es. Both within and without the town are &s;everal plea&s;ant walks, particularly on the ramparts. It was once one of the fortre&s;&s;es of Hol|land. The country round about it once con&s;i&s;ted of lakes, which have been all drained, and now make an excellent appearance, being all cut into rich mea|dows, and hardly an acre lo&s;t. All the canals and dykes are planted with rows of trees; the villages are thick and well peopled, and all of them po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing an air of neatne&s;s and regularity, which alone would make travelling in Holland extremely de|lightful.</P>
<P>The road from this place to Bem&s;ter, in &s;ummer is very plea&s;ant. At the end of the town begins a &s;traight vi&s;ta, which continues for three miles. In the middle of this vi&s;ta there is a wide canal, and on each &s;ide a road perfectly level and &s;mooth, with a row of trees, and a ditch running along the out|&s;ide; both of which are bordered with the fine&s;t mea|dows, inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;eats and gardens. Every cottage has a garden which the boors cultivate ex|tremely well. The women and children are princi|pally employed in making nets for the herring fi&s;he|ry, which employs a great number of hands in this country.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="349">It is a&s;toni&s;hing that the number of people whom this fi&s;hery maintains, &s;hould not have made us, on who&s;e coa&s;ts they come to fi&s;h, more attentive to ad|vantages which nature has laid at our doors. Our poor are &s;tarving for want of employment, while our more indu&s;trious and meritorious neighbours maintain them|&s;elves on our fi&s;h, and come 200 leagues to catch that which we might have in our own harbours. Such an in|&s;tance of &s;upinene&s;s is not to be met with in the whole circle of European politics. The infinite advantages which would attend the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a great herring fi&s;hery, in &s;ome of the we&s;tern i&s;les of Scotland, ought to engage our government to act with more vigour in this affair. The only po&s;&s;ible way of &s;ucceeding, would be, to build a town in the we&s;tern I&s;lands, and make it the &s;eat of the whole undertaking: the com|pany &s;hould, above all, be careful to provide an imme|diate market for all the fi&s;h caught, &s;alted, and barrelled, under their in&s;pection. When once the fi&s;hermen found a market for their fi&s;h, their profe&s;&s;ion would increa&s;e very much; new towns would ri&s;e up, and a general alacrity &s;pread it&s;elf through all the coa&s;ts. This would form new markets for all the productions of the neighbouring e&s;tates, which would animate their culture, and greatly increa&s;e the value of land; all this is in the power not only of the King and Parlia|ment, but of any nobleman of con&s;iderable property in the i&s;lands: a private capital of 20,000l. would go
<PB N="335" REF="350">
further than five times that &s;um in the hands of a public company.</P>
<P>In Holland, what with pay, allowance, and herrings, the men who go in the bu&s;&s;es gain about twelve &s;hillings a-week.</P>
<P>On the coa&s;t of this province are &s;everal i&s;lands, which formerly made part of the continent, and have been &s;eparated from it by the violence of the &s;ea. The inhabitants of the&s;e i&s;lands make excellent mari|ners, whether con&s;idered with re&s;pect to their courage, or their &s;kill.</P>
<P>One great occupation among them is breeding of &s;heep, with which their fields are covered. They ac|cordingly export a great deal of wool; and with the milk of the&s;e animals they make a green chee&s;e, which is eagerly bought up under the name of Texel chee&s;e.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e i&s;lands is the Texel, which mo&s;t probably received its name from the mul|titude of eggs, which the &s;ea-gulls lay on its &s;hores: it is the large&s;t of all the i&s;lands in this track.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;tern coa&s;t there is a commodious road, &s;tyled the <HI>Mo&s;co Road,</HI> which is the rendezvous of all the outward bound Ea&s;t-India &s;hips, who lye here under the cannon of a fort, clo&s;e erected by the Scheld. At
<PB N="336" REF="351">
this place they are al&s;o mu&s;tered while they wait for an ea&s;terly wind, to carry them out of the Mar&s;diep, during which time they are u&s;ually &s;aid to be lying in the Texel.</P>
<P>This is the principal pa&s;&s;age for &s;hips that come from Am&s;terdam, or the Zuyder&s;ea into the ocean. It is however a very dangerous one, on account of two &s;and-banks which lye at the entrance, particularly in bad weather or with a contrary wind.</P>
<P>On the 13th of July 1672, the Engli&s;h fleet under the Duke of York, came off this i&s;land, as with an in|tent to make a de&s;cent; but the ebb which u&s;ed to la&s;t only &s;ix hours, continuing in a very extraordinary manner for twelve, and being &s;ucceeded by a &s;torm, the Engli&s;h were under the nece&s;&s;ity of putting out to &s;ea, after lo&s;ing two of their &s;hips. In 1653, and 1673, there were two naval engagements here, in the fir&s;t of which the celebrated Dutch Admiral <HI>Van Trump</HI> was killed.</P>
<P>At the entrance of the water, going up to Am&s;ter|dam, there are two other &s;and banks, where it is &s;o very &s;hallow, that the &s;hips are obliged to be carried over them in cradles or camels, which are a kind of large boxes, 160 feet in length, filled with water, and fa&s;ten|ed with ropes under the &s;ide of the &s;hips; the water is then drawn out of the&s;e machines, which as they
<PB N="337" REF="352" MS="y">
ri&s;e towards the &s;urface, lift the &s;hips up four, five or &s;ix feet, according to the more or le&s;s water they draw.</P>
