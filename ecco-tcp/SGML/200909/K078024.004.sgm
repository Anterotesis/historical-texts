<P>The Caterpillar of this &s;ingular In&s;ect is very common in May; it is of a green colour, with a white &s;tripe down the back, and one on each &s;ide; it ca&s;ts its &s;kin &s;everal times.</P>
<P>We have ob&s;erved &s;ome Caterpillars which were quite &s;mooth, after ca&s;ting their &s;kin become rough or covered with hairs; and others which
<PB N="6" REF="7">
were white become black by the &s;ame proce&s;s; in this caterpillar we have ob&s;erved a &s;imilar change: a &s;pecimen which was of a plain green as before de&s;cribed, became &s;uddenly &s;potted with black as &s;hewn in our plate, that &s;kin being ca&s;t off it a&s;&s;umed its former appearance and became a pupa.</P>
<P>It feeds on gra&s;s, nettles, &amp;c. near the &s;ides of ditches, and is found &s;porting in the evening, when in the fly &s;tate among the gra&s;s and herbage.</P>
<P>The Caterpillar becomes a Pupa about the beginning of June.&mdash;It affixes it&s;elf by the tail to a &s;talk of gra&s;s in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of the Butterfly genus, and like them is often found with the head &s;u&s;pended downwards; it can by a &s;udden &s;pring turn it&s;elf upright again.</P>
<P>In a little book entitled the AURELIAN'S POCKET COMPANION, by Mo&s;es Harris, we find this &s;pecies de&s;cribed, and called the <HI>White Plumed,</HI> but the Linnaean &s;pecified Name <HI>Didactyla</HI> is added:&mdash;And under the Linnaean name Pentadactyla (our pre&s;ent &s;pecimen) he has de&s;cribed the <HI>Brown plumed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Another &s;pecimen of the &s;ame divi&s;ion of the genus <HI>(Aluctae)</HI> but of a brown colour "Alis fi&s;&s;is fu&s;cis, &amp;c." <HI>Linn.</HI></NOTE>.&mdash;The &s;ame confu&s;ion is extended to his folio work the AURELIAN. In Plate 1. he has figured the White plumed under the &s;pecific name Didactyla, and in Plate 30, the Brown plume, under Pentadactyla. Linnaeus has compri&s;ed all tho&s;e Lepi|dopterous In&s;ects who&s;e wings appear to con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal di&s;tinct feathers, connected only at the &s;hafts, under the &s;ubdivi&s;ion <HI>Aluctae,</HI> but Fabricius has given them the new name PTEROPHORUS, and added the name Alucitae to a &s;mall divi&s;ion of the Tinea, as Phal. Chri&s;tylo&s;tella, &amp;c. of <HI>Linn.</HI></P>
<P>The Phal. Pentadactyla appears in the perfect &s;tate about the latter end of June, &s;ometimes earlier.</P>

<P>The wonderful in&s;tinct that directs the &s;malle&s;t In&s;ects to provide for the &s;afety of their future progeny, never fails to &s;trike the attention of the inqui&s;itive re&s;earcher into their oeconomy.&mdash;To perpetuate their
<PB N="32" REF="35">
race is the great end of their being, and the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing effort of their ingenuity and care is employed to perfect this grand de&s;ign. We not only find innumerable eggs, and larvae of In&s;ect on all kinds of plants; in all &s;tanding waters; and in animal matter, when putrid; but many which can only be hatched from the egg by the warmth of living animals; thus the Tabanus pierces the thick hide of the Cow, and plunges its eggs into the fle&s;h; the heat and moi&s;ture of which nouri&s;hes both in the egg, and larva; the Hippobo&s;ca equina pro|trudes its eggs into the <HI>rectum</HI> of Hor&s;es; and the Ichneumon into living Caterpillars: to tho&s;e we could add many remarkable in&s;tances of In&s;ects, who have &s;hewn a lower &s;pecies of perception, by depo&s;it|ing their eggs in places where the larvae would find abundance of proper food; and with &s;uch ingenious contrivances for their &s;afety in a defencele&s;s &s;tate, as we could only expect from the &s;agacity of larger animals; but it is only our intention to premi&s;e with tho&s;e general re|marks, le&s;t the &s;ubject we have cho&s;en for our pre&s;ent Plate &s;hould be con&s;idered as a &s;olitary example of &s;uch ingenuity, and care towards their future offspring.</P>
<P>The Natural Hi&s;tory of the Common Bee has been both fully and ably treated of, by <HI>Schirach, Maraldi, Reaumur, Debraw,</HI> and other authors of re&s;pectability, and may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be pretty generally known by tho&s;e conver&s;ant in rural affairs; the manners, however, of other &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus has neither been &s;o fully explained, nor examined; they yet pre&s;ent a fund for the enquiries of the Na|turali&s;t, equally worthy his attention; though le&s;s beneficial; as the honey they make cannot be converted to our u&s;e.</P>
<P>Among the &s;olitary Bees, &s;ome penetrate into the earth, &s;coop out hollow cavities; then poli&s;h the &s;ides within, and depo&s;it their eggs, with proper food for the larvae, till it becomes a Pupa. Others form ne&s;ts of loo&s;e &s;and, which they glue together with a &s;trong cement; tho&s;e ne&s;ts are generally formed again&s;t walls that are expo&s;ed to the &s;outh; without, they are rude and irregular, but within are very neatly fini&s;hed, and divided into &s;everal cells or apartments, in each of which the Parent Bee lodges an egg. Of our pre&s;ent, and a few other &s;pecies, we may &s;ay,

<P>We find this &s;ea&s;on, the Apis Centuncularis has done con&s;iderable injury among the Timber Plantations in <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> and we have &s;imilar information from &s;ome parts of <HI>Cambridge&s;hire.</HI> A Gentleman &s;ent me (early in the Spring) a piece of Oak, containing a quantity of the larva, from his plantation at <HI>Birdbrook,</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> He informs me, &s;everal Gentlemen in his neighbourhood had found large trunks of apparently healthy Oaks, completely perforated and filled with the larva of this mi&s;chievous In&s;ect; in many in&s;tances the trunk had been materially injured, and the ca&s;es were arranged as &s;hewn by the hori|zontal Section at Fig. 4, in our Plate.&mdash;The perforations were in a longitudinal direction, &s;everal feet through the &s;olid timber, and when the leaves were fre&s;h, appeared as &s;hewn at Fig. 1.</P>
<P>The In&s;ect commences its operation at the upper part of the trunk of the tree; then boring in an oblique direction for about two inches or more, it follows a longitudinal cour&s;e, it divides the ligneous fibres, or threads, till it forms the diameter of the cavity, which is about three-eighths of an inch, its depth various; &s;ometimes only a few inches, at others, con&s;iderably more; when the cavity is entirely formed, and all the du&s;t and fragments cleared away, it fini&s;hes the &s;ides perfectly &s;mooth; the harde&s;t knot in the timber being in&s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t the &s;trength of its jaws.&mdash;The cavity, when fini&s;hed, appears divided by &s;light ridges, placed at the di&s;tance of about three quarters of an inch from each other; this &s;erves to regulate the &s;ize of each apartment or cell; and it now only remains to be lined for the reception of the egg: this lining is generally compo&s;ed of ro&s;e-leaves; and is applied to the apartments in a very curious manner: the Parent Bee flies with a leaf to the orifice of the perforation, where &s;he clips it round to the &s;ize of the hole; this is forced to the bottom of the lowe&s;t cell; about &s;even, eight, or ten of &s;uch pieces form the fir&s;t layer; it next forms the &s;ides, or cylindrical part of the lining; this is done by laying &s;everal whole leaves partly over each
<PB N="34" REF="37">
other, as &s;hewn in our Plate, and cementing them together with a glutinous &s;ub&s;tance; thus the &s;ides and bottom, each con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal layers, being fini&s;hed, (in the form of a thimble) the Bee partly fills it with a kind of pa&s;te, then throws over it a &s;mall quantity of leaves, reduced to powder, and depo&s;its the egg; the covering to the whole is formed of the &s;ame materials, and in the &s;ame manner as the bottom; when &s;he has forced about ten or fifteen circular pieces of leaves into the avenue and cemented them to the top, the covering is completed, and the egg is completely &s;ecured from accident.&mdash;The covering &s;eparated is &s;hewn in the Plate, at fig. 3, the larvae, at fig. 2.</P>
<P>In this manner &s;he proceeds with, and fini&s;hes every cell di&s;tinctly, till the perforation is entirely filled: in &s;ome trees forty or fifty &s;uch perforations are placed within a quarter of an inch of each other.&mdash; The Bee comes forth late in Augu&s;t; if the lowe&s;t is formed before tho&s;e above, it eats its way up the channel, through their ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> in his E&s;&s;ay on the Micro&s;cope, mentions a remarkable circum&s;tance of a Bee (we &s;u&s;pect of this &s;pecies).

<P>A very rare &s;pecies of Phalaena. In the perfect &s;tate it is &s;eldom met with; and in the Caterpillar &s;tate few Collectors are acquainted with its haunts. It feeds on the &s;allow, willow, and poplar, and may be found &s;ometimes by &s;tripping off the bark of tho&s;e trees.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="49">Our &s;pecimen was taken in the vicinity of Oak-of-Honor Hill, Surry. The Caterpillar was met with when it was ready to &s;pin its web, in which &s;tate it is repre&s;ented; its &s;pinning was formed be|tween the folds of a leaf in the month of October, the Moth came forth in May.</P>
<P>The Moth in the upper part of the plate is a &s;mall &s;pecimen of the female; it differs very little from the male, except that the an|tennae of the latter is much feathered, as is &s;hewn on the back of the leaf.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies is more plentiful on the continent of Europe, and a variety of it is a native of &s;ome parts of North America.</P>
<P>A Collector of In&s;ects in London met with a brood of this &s;pecies la&s;t September, in the Caterpillar &s;tate, containing more than twenty; &s;ome were covered with a milk-white down, others inclining to grey, but in general they were like the &s;pecimen given in our plate. They changed their appearance frequently, and &s;ome were much larger than the re&s;t. The Moths al&s;o differ very much both in &s;ize and colour; &s;ome are dingy, others have the chocolate colour much dif|fu&s;ed; and in general, when the In&s;ect is perfect, it is beautifully varied with a pale bloom of a purple hue.</P>

<HEAD>PHALAENA ANASTOMOSIS. FIG. IV.</HEAD>
<P>Since the publication of the la&s;t Number, we have been favoured with a mo&s;t beautiful &s;pecimen of the Moth figured in the 124th Plate of this Work, and pre&s;ent a figure of it to our &s;ub&s;cribers, together with the &s;everal changes of the Phalaena Ha&s;tata; it will &s;hew how very liable this In&s;ect is to variation in its colours, &s;ize, &amp;c.</P>
<P>We find al&s;o that though this In&s;ect has been named Phalaena Ana&s;tomo&s;is in the mo&s;t &s;cientific Cabinets in London, and always received as &s;uch by the be&s;t authority, it is not the In&s;ect referred to by Fabricius in his Species In&s;ectorum under that title; that Author, as well as Linnaeus, refers under the &s;pecific name <HI>Ph. Curtula</HI> to the 43d Plate of the third Volume of Roe&s;el's In&s;ects; in this Plate is figured a Moth which is certainly a &s;pecies di&s;tinct from our In&s;ect, and is well known by its Linnaean name <HI>Curtula,</HI> or Engli&s;h title <HI>Chocolate Tip;</HI> yet Fabricius gives an addi|tional reference for the &s;ame &s;pecies to the 11th Plate of Roe&s;el's
<PB N="57" REF="62">
fourth Volume of In&s;ects, and in this we find the figure of a Moth who&s;e markings and general appearance corre&s;pond with our &s;peci|men, though its colours are totally different, being a very pale grey with &s;carcely any dark colour near the apex of the wings; the larva much more re&s;embles our figure, and induces us to conclude, that though the figure of this la&s;t Moth is &s;o extremely different, it is probably intended for the &s;ame &s;pecies as our In&s;ect; and therefore that the two di&s;tinct &s;pecies have been confounded together, by a fal&s;e quotation of Linnaeus's Amanuen&s;is.</P>
<P>And we are partly confirmed in this &s;uppo&s;ition by the words of Linnaeus him&s;elf; he &s;ays, <HI>Ph. Ana&s;tomo&s;is</HI> is very like <HI>Ph. Curtula,</HI> but the Moth figured in Roe&s;el's plate, and referred to in the Syno|nyms under Ana&s;tomo&s;is, does not bear the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to it; &mdash;our In&s;ect on the contrary, though evidently a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, is not unlike it.</P>

<P>We have been furni&s;hed with the larva of this extremely rare In&s;ect in a &s;ingular manner; a wa&s;ted &s;pecimen of the female was taken in the Summer of the year 1794, and depo&s;ited a quantity of eggs in the box in which it was &s;tuck; the&s;e hatching &s;ome time after, a great number of young Caterpillars were produced; &s;everal of a full &s;ize, pa&s;&s;ed to the pupa &s;tate, (in a reddi&s;h web &s;pun on the leaves) and four fine Moths came forth la&s;t Summer.</P>
<P>The eggs were very minute, perfectly globular, and of a pale greeni&s;h colour: the clu&s;ter con&s;i&s;ted of more than &s;eventy, and few of them proved abortive; but &s;ome of the large&s;t Caterpillars de|voured

the re&s;t, and many others wandered from the food, and &s;o peri&s;hed. The Moths were far &s;uperior for the beauty and richne&s;s of their colours to any &s;pecimens we have &s;een before; but this is not remarkable, as mo&s;t of the &s;pecimens pre&s;erved in Cabinets near London, have been taken in the winged &s;tate.</P>
<P>It feeds on the lime; is found in the Caterpillar &s;tate in Augu&s;t; the Moth appears in June. Is &s;ometimes taken in the interior part of Darent-Wood, Dartford; and rarely el&s;ewhere near London. It has been met with al&s;o at Fever&s;ham, in Kent, on the Elm.</P>
<P><HI>Kleman,</HI> in the la&s;t volume of German In&s;ects, lately publi&s;hed, has given three figures of this Moth; but has neither figured the Caterpillar nor Pupa. <HI>Fabricius</HI> is the only &s;y&s;tematical Writer who appears to have noticed it.</P>

<P>Among an almo&s;t endle&s;s variety of &s;pecies, which the tribes of In&s;ects pre&s;ent, few have a more &s;ingular appearance than the little creature we have &s;elected for our pre&s;ent &s;ubject. It is perhaps one of the mo&s;t curious pieces of natural mechani&s;m (if we may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) that can be conceived, for of a mo&s;t com|plicated fabric which the wings appear, every part, though &s;eparate,

acts in perfect uni&s;on with the re&s;t; in mo&s;t winged In&s;ects we find the tendons of each wing united by &s;trong membranaceous webs, which prevent any one from acting without the others, but in this every tendon mu&s;t perform a di&s;tinct part, and yet perfectly in conformity with the re&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t the In&s;ect in its flight. When the In&s;ect re&s;ts the feathers fold over one another; but when it flies, they are thrown open, and re&s;emble a full expanded fan.</P>
<P>The natural &s;ize of this &s;ingular creature is given at Fig. 1. and as a more correct figure than can be &s;hewn in &s;uch a &s;mall compa&s;s was thought nece&s;&s;ary, its magnified appearance is repre&s;ented at Fig. 2.</P>
<P>The plumes of this In&s;ect differs &s;o much from tho&s;e of other Moths, that we have al&s;o added, at Fig. 3, the appearance of the upper part of one, as &s;een by a very deep lens of the Micro&s;cope; by this the &s;tem or quil is ob&s;erved covered with &s;cales of the form u&s;ually found on other Moths, but the &s;ides are finely feathered with long hairs, in tufts, alternately of a light and dark colour, and which, owing to the minutene&s;s of the In&s;ect appear like patches of an uniform colour, before it is examined with the Micro&s;cope.</P>

<P>Though this beautiful In&s;ect is very common in &s;ome places in the Butterfly &s;tate, we have never met with it's larva, nor with any account of it that appeared &s;atisfactory. In that &s;tate it &s;eems &s;carcely known. It is &s;aid, by &s;ome Collectors, to be a plain green Cater|pillar, with very few hairs, bulky, and broade&s;t acro&s;s the middle. It certainly feeds very low among the thicke&s;t gra&s;s, or perhaps like
<PB N="94" REF="105">
&s;ome larvae of Moths, never comes above the &s;urface of the ground, and lives on the roots of gra&s;s.</P>
<P>The Male is of a fine blue colour on the upper &s;ide, and elegantly marked on the under &s;ide with white circles, having a black &s;pot in the center of each: the wings are al&s;o bordered with &s;imilar &s;pots, marked with a vermillion colour. The Female has very little ap|pearance of the fine blue of the Male: the upper wings are of a dull browni&s;h black, with a blui&s;h colour on parts, and marked with a few red and black &s;pots: the under&s;ide as in the Male.</P>
<P>They &s;eem to delight in Meadows, and, like all other Butterflies, are on the wing only in the day time. The fir&s;t brood appears in the Fly &s;tate in June.</P>

<P>Early in July we find this &s;pecies flying about the narrow paths and lanes in woods where Oaks are plenty. It is ob&s;erved to &s;helter it&s;elf in the day time, generally among &s;uch trees as have the foliage

thick and the bark covered with mo&s;s, &amp;c. and very &s;eldom among young trees. In the Caterpillar &s;tate it lives concealed in a fine &s;ilky web, &s;pun up on the leaves. When it is di&s;turbed it drops by a &s;ingle thread from one branch to another, the glutinous &s;ub&s;tance of the thread adhering wherever it touches, &s;o that if it is damaged in any part the In&s;ect is in no danger of falling, unle&s;s the la&s;t fa&s;t|ening breaks off. The Caterpillar changes to the pupa &s;tate early in June: the fir&s;t appearance of the Moth is commonly about the end of the &s;ame month.</P>
<P>In England we have another &s;mall Moth (Phalaena Chlorana) which at fir&s;t &s;ight may be mi&s;taken for Phalaena Viridana. It differs from this In&s;ect in &s;everal re&s;pects; the under Wings are whiter, and the &s;tripe along the anterior margin of the upper Wings incline more to a cream colour than in our pre&s;ent &s;pecies; the Caterpillar al&s;o is very different and feeds on the Willow.</P>
