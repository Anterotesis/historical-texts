<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, this is the mo&s;t unexpected Vi&s;it!&mdash; but prithee, <HI>Harwood,</HI> what in the Name of My&s;tery, hath brought thee to town at this unfa&s;hion|able Time of the Year?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Lo&s;s of my fair Hou&s;ekeeper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Lo&s;s of <HI>Maria!</HI>&mdash;Is &s;he dead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wor&s;e, my dear <HI>Frankly</HI>&mdash;elop'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Elop'd! Why I thought you had &s;o great a Re|gard for each other, that you had been as in&s;eparable as old Age and Avarice, or a Coquette and a Looking-Gla&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought &s;o too: but Women are as changeable as their Dre&s;&s;es: there is no an&s;wering for the Humours of the Sex &mdash;tho' Faith I cannot altogether excu&s;e my&s;elf in the Affair of our Parting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, <HI>Charles,</HI> after the Death of my Wi&s;e, whom, with Shame I mu&s;t own, I never thoroughly, lov'd, as &s;he was not mine but my Father's Choice. I prevail'd on <HI>Maria,</HI> who was either beggar'd by an unnatural Fa|ther or a villainous Uncle, to take upon her the Care of my Family. &mdash; Her good Sen&s;e, Beauty, and Behaviour, imperceptibly won my Heart; but my Pride forbidding me to marry a Woman without a Fortune, I made u&s;e of every Means in my Power to&mdash;gain her Affections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand you: to gain them in the old Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the fair <HI>Maria</HI> was &s;o much upon her Guard, or &s;o ob&s;tinately virtuous, that nothing but downright Matrimony would induce her to li&s;ten to my Sollicitations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>An unrea&s;onable Gip&s;y! And &s;o you dropp'd the Affair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not quite &s;o ha&s;ty in your Conclu&s;ions, good Sir.&mdash;After a va&s;t Profu&s;ion of lying and &s;wearing, which fail'd of the de&s;ir'd Succe&s;s, I determin'd to make my grand Attack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Re&s;olv'd like a Man of Spirit!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>And accordingly one Night the la&s;t Week,
<Q><L>When ev'ry Eye was clos'd, and the pale Moon</L>
<L>And Stars alone &s;hone con&s;cious of the Theft,</L>
<L>Hot with the <HI>Gallic</HI> Grape, and high in Blood,</L></Q>and &s;o forth, I began my A&s;&s;ault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be needle&s;s to tell thee I was repuls'd. &mdash;In &s;hort, the dear, lovely, affronted, virtuous <HI>Maria,</HI> &s;o highly re&s;ented the Familiarity, that &s;he in&s;tantly left the Hou&s;e, and from that Hour I have not &s;et Eye on the fair En&s;laver.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o you are come to Town to hire a new Hou&s;ekeeper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; to marry my old one, if I can be &s;o fortu|nate as to encounter her.&mdash;I mu&s;t have her!&mdash;I cannot be ea&s;y without her.&mdash;I have &s;ome faint Hopes of meet|ing with her, as &s;he was &s;een on the <HI>London</HI> Road.&mdash; Which do you think the mo&s;t likely Way of finding her out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hum!&mdash;this requires &s;ome thought&mdash;ay&mdash;Pray what do you think of a penitential Adverti&s;ement?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>No hang it! Should I be di&s;covered for the Au|thor, it would make me too ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true I mu&s;t confe&s;s&mdash;&s;tay&mdash;do you ima|gine &s;he will be looking after another Place?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy &s;he will, as her Finances mu&s;t below.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the only Method I can put you into is an. Application to &s;ome of our Intelligence-Warehou&s;es.</P>

<P>Oh! I take you! the Places where Servants may be heard of.&mdash;Pray were not the&s;e Offices invented by the ingenious Author of <HI>Tom Jones?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were.&mdash;The Project hath been, and &s;till is of great Utility to the Publick; but as there is no general Rule without an Exception, this laudable In&s;titution hath been &s;trangely perverted, thro' the Villainy and Avarice of &s;ome of it's Managers.&mdash;There is an old Ra&s;cal in this Neighbourhood, who hath ama&s;s'd a tolerable Fortune by Abu&s;es of this Kind. His Office is frequented by Per|&s;ons of every Degree; and, among it's other Con|veniences, the good old Trade of Pimping is carried on with great Succe&s;s and Decency. I believe as many Pro&s;elytes have been made to the Fle&s;h, by the Knavery of this Ra&s;cal, as by the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful Bawd in Town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, I find the old Fellow is a Genius in his Way?</P>

<P>A complete one. &mdash; Our old School-fellow, <HI>Jack: Williams,</HI> is his Clerk, from which honourable Employ|ment he retires in a few Days to a Steward&s;hip, to which I have lately recommended him.&mdash;By his Means I have often had an Opportunity of overhearing &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages, which have afforded great Humour and Entertainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>If my Heart were not &s;o full for the Lo&s;s of this dear Woman, I could like to throw away an Hour in an Amu&s;ement of this Kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you may this very Morning if you plea&s;e&mdash; I'll introduce you &mdash; It will help to di&s;&s;ipate your Melan|choly for the Lo&s;s of your fair De&s;erter.</P>

<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>So this Adverti&s;ement has brought in two Pounds thirteen &s;hillings&mdash;no very bad Morning's Work&mdash;Well, thanks to the Memory of our witty Eounder, &s;ay I! Had he not luckily hit on the Scheme of a Regi&s;ter-Of|fice,
<PB N="9" REF="8">I might have dangled on at Quill-driving without ever being worth a Groat.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> there is Roguery in all the Em|ployments under the Sun. Every Day's Experience will convince you, that there is no getting through the World without a nece&s;&s;ary Portion of Trick and Chicanery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if the Impo&s;ture of this very Adverti&s;ement were &s;ound out and duly puni&s;h'd, one or both of us would &s;tand a fair Chance for the Pillory. How many poor Girls have this Morning been &s;tripped of perhaps their la&s;t Shilling, by being amu&s;ed with the Hopes of the Place we have adverti&s;ed&mdash;In Faith, Sir, &s;ome of our Profe&s;&s;ion are little better than downright Pickpockets&mdash; I am glad I &s;hall have the good Fortune to leave it &s;o &s;oon.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> I am truly &s;orry for our Separa|tion, yet rejoice at the Occa&s;ion of it&mdash;however, if you hope to make a Fortune in your alter'd Condition of Life, you mu&s;t learn to keep your Con&s;cience in proper Subor|dination. I can a&s;&s;ure you, that Fraud is as nece&s;&s;ary a Requi&s;ite in a Steward&s;hip, as in an Intelligence-Office. &mdash; Is there no Me&s;&s;age from Dr. <HI>Skinflint</HI> about the <HI>Welch</HI> Living?</P>
