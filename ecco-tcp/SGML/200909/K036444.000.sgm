<BYLINE>By the late Mr. <HI>CUNNINGHAM.</HI></BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>O'ER moorlands and mountains, rude, barren, and bare,</L>
<L>As wearied and wilder'd I roam,</L>
<L>A gentle young &s;hepherde&s;s &s;ees my de&s;pair,</L>
<L>And leads me o'er lawns to her home;</L>
<L>Yellow &s;heaves from rich Ceres her cottage had crown'd,</L>
<L>Green ru&s;hes were &s;trew'd on the floor,</L>
<L>Her ca&s;ement &s;weet woodbines crept wantonly round,</L>
<L>And deck'd the &s;od &s;eats at the door.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We &s;at our&s;elves down to a cooling repa&s;t,</L>
<L>Fre&s;h fruits, and &s;he cull'd me the be&s;t;</L>
<L>Whil&s;t thrown from my guard, by &s;ome glances &s;he ca&s;t,</L>
<L>Love &s;lily &s;tole into my brea&s;t:</L>
<L>I told my &s;oft wi&s;hes, &s;he &s;weetly reply'd.</L>
<L>(Ye virgins, her voice was divine!)</L>
<L>I've rich one's rejected, and great ones deny'd,</L>
<L>Yet take me, fond &s;hepherd, I'm thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her air was &s;o mode&s;t, her a&s;pect &s;o meek,</L>
<L>So &s;imple, tho' &s;weet, were her charms;</L>
<L>I ki&s;s'd the ripe ro&s;es that glow'd on her cheek,</L>
<L>And lock'd the dear maid in my arms:</L>
<L>Now jocund together we tend a few &s;heep,</L>
<L>And if on the banks by the &s;tream,</L>
<L>Reclin'd on her bo&s;om I &s;ink into &s;leep,</L>
<L>Her image &s;till &s;oftens my dream.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Together we range o'er the &s;low-ri&s;ing hills,</L>
<L>Delighted with pa&s;toral views;</L>
<L>Or re&s;t on the rock, whence the &s;treamlet di&s;tils,</L>
<L>And mark out new themes for my mu&s;e.</L>
<L>To pomp, or proud titles, &s;he ne'er did a&s;pire,</L>
<L>The dam&s;el's of humble de&s;cent;</L>
<L>The cottager Peace is well known for her &s;ire,</L>
<L>The &s;hepherds have nam'd her CONTENT.</L>
