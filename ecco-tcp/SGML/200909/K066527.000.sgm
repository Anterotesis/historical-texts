<P>THE author of the following rhimes, hath too much neglected the mu&s;es, either to de&s;erve or expect any great reputation as a poet. He hath ever &s;et &s;o little &s;tore, indeed, by his poetical per|formances, as to be now able to procure copies of but few of tho&s;e, which have occa&s;ionally dropt from his pen. It would be impertinent in him however, to affect to undervalue what he is obtruding on the publick; e&s;pecially as mo&s;t of the pieces contained in this collection have been frequently printed, and therefore may be pre&s;umed to have met with &s;ome approbation.</P>

<LG>
<L>THE mu&s;e of Shake&s;peare's compliments! &mdash;A card</L>
<L>T'excu&s;e this evening's enterprizing bard!</L>
<L>Great his pre&s;umption, to confe&s;s the truth:</L>
<L>But, as he pleads the pa&s;&s;ion of his youth,</L>
<L>Together with the magick of her charms,</L>
<L>Attracting him re&s;i&s;tle&s;s to her arms;</L>
<L>Tho' &s;omewhat by &s;urprize, &s;he owns, &s;he &s;uffer'd,</L>
<L>Yet, as no actual violence was offer'd,</L>
<L>She's willing, if the audience &s;hould agree,</L>
<L>For this one time to &s;et th' offender free.</L>
<L>We women &s;oon forgive, if not forget,</L>
<L>The crimes our beauties make the men commit,</L>
<L>E&s;pecially when once we're pa&s;t our prime,</L>
<L>And Shake&s;peare's mu&s;e, like me, 's the wor&s;e for time.</L>
<L>For, tho' &s;he charm with fancy ever young,</L>
<L>Tho heav'nly mu&s;ick dwell upon her tongue,</L>
<L>Lo&s;t many an artle&s;s &s;mile and dimple &s;leek,</L>
<L>Which &s;at alluring on her virgin cheek;</L>
<L>Beauties, that faded on the gazer's eye,</L>
<L>And no cold-cream of comment can &s;upply.</L>
<L><PB N="298" REF="303">
As for what Merc'ry in the prologue told ye;</L>
<L>Pray, let not that from clemency with-hold ye.</L>
<L>That Hermes was of old a lying blade,</L>
<L>And practic'd in impo&s;ture, as his trade;</L>

<L>A me&s;&s;enger from Phoebus! He a god!</L>
<L>I can a&s;&s;ure you all, 'twas Mr. Dodd;</L>
<L>His dropping from the clouds, was all a &s;ham;</L>
<L>And his pretended errand but a flam.</L>

<LG>
<L>His tale fictitious too, tho' told &s;o glib;</L>
<L>For take it on my word, 'twas all a fib.</L>
<L>Old Fal&s;taff in Ely&s;ium!&mdash;To my thinking,</L>
<L>So great his natural tendency to &s;inking,</L>
<L>That to the &s;hades if he had once de&s;cended,</L>
<L>To bring him back not Atlas had pretended.</L>
<L>Dramatic &s;prites (at lea&s;t they tell me &s;o)</L>
<L>Dwell not with &s;aints above, nor devils below:</L>
<L><PB N="299" REF="304">
But, form'd th' imagination to engage,</L>
<L>During their &s;hort-liv'd pa&s;&s;age o'er the &s;tage,</L>

<L>And &s;tand as cyphers mark'd on nature's li&s;t;</L>
<L>To genius giv'n a delegated power</L>
<L>To form the&s;e tran&s;ient beings of an hour;</L>
<L>Which, from this mimic world whene'er they go,</L>
<L>Are free to range in fancy's pimlico:</L>
<L>A limbo large and broad; which in the &s;chools</L>
<L>Is call'd by &s;ome the paradi&s;e of fools.</L>
<L>Ferae naturae there, their pre&s;ervation</L>
<L>Is purchas'd by no game a&s;&s;ociation;</L>
<L>The poaching plagiary alone denied</L>
<L>A privilege, granted to each bard be&s;ide;</L>
<L>Who, tho' a cottager, to try his &s;kill,</L>
<L>May &s;hoot, or cour&s;e, or hunt them down at will;</L>
<L>In his own paddock may the &s;trays receive,</L>
<L>And &s;corn to a&s;k a lordly owner's leave.</L>

<L>Not but that here, the author of the play,</L>
