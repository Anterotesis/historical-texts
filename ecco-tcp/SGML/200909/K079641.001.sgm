<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following ob&s;ervations on various &s;cenes of Engli&s;h land&s;cape, were writ|ten about thirteen years ago. They were at fir&s;t thrown together, warm from the &s;ubject, each evening, after the &s;cene of the day had been pre&s;ented; and in a moment of more lei&s;ure, were corrected, and put into form &mdash;but merely for the amu&s;ement of the writer him&s;elf; who had not, in truth, at that time, the lea&s;t idea of their being able to furni&s;h amu&s;ement to any body el&s;e. A few only of his friends &s;aw them. One of them however
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
&s;aw them with &s;o partial an eye, that he thought proper to mention them to the public<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ma&s;on's memoirs of Gray, p. 377.</NOTE>. This rai&s;ed the curio&s;ity of many; and laid the au|thor under the nece&s;&s;ity of producing his papers to a wider circle: but &s;till without any de&s;ign of publi&s;hing them. A &s;en&s;e of their imper|fections; and of the many difficulties, in which &s;uch a work, would engage him, prevented any intention of that kind.</P>
<P>Among others, who de&s;ired to &s;ee them, was the late duche&s;s dowager of Portland; a lady, of who&s;e &s;uperior character the world is well informed. Having &s;een them &s;oon after they were written, and a &s;econd time after an inter|val of &s;even, or eight years, her Grace pre&s;&s;ed the author to print them; mo&s;t obligingly offering to facilitate an expen&s;ive publication by contributing largely to a &s;ub&s;cription. Tho the author cho&s;e to decline that mode of publi|cation, yet the duche&s;s's per&s;ua&s;ion was among his principal inducements to prepare his papers
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
for the public. The pre&s;s-work was about half completed at the time of her Grace's death.</P>
<P>But tho this work hath been thus flattered; and hath received con&s;iderable improvements, both from the author him&s;elf, during the many years it has lain by him; and from &s;everal of his ingenious friends; yet &s;till he offers it to the public with apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>His apprehen&s;ion is fir&s;t grounded on the inadequate time he had to employ in making ob&s;ervations on the &s;everal land&s;capes he has de&s;cribed. No one can paint a country properly, unle&s;s he hath &s;een it in various lights. The following de&s;criptions are faithful copies, it is hoped, of each &s;cene, under the cir|cum&s;tances, in which it appeared, at the time it was de&s;cribed. But he, who &s;hould &s;ee any one &s;cene, as it is differently affected by a lower|ing &s;ky, or a bright one, might probably
<PB N="viii" REF="9">
&s;ee two very different land&s;capes. He might not only &s;ee di&s;tances blotted out; or &s;plen|didly exhibited: but he might even &s;ee va|riations produced in the very objects them|&s;elves; and that merely from the different times of the day, in which they were ex|amined. The &s;ummit of a mountain, for in&s;tance, which in a morning appears round, may di&s;cover, when enlightened by an evening ray, a double top. Rocks, and woods take different &s;hapes from the different directions of light; while the hues and tints of objects (on which their effect, in a great mea&s;ure, depends) are continually changing. Nay we &s;ometimes &s;ee (in a mountainous country e&s;pe|cially) a variation of light alter the whole di&s;po&s;ition of a land&s;cape. In a warm &s;un|&s;hine the purple hills may &s;kirt the horizon, and appear broken into numberle&s;s plea&s;ing forms: but under a &s;ullen &s;ky a total change may be produced: the di&s;tant mountains, and all their beautiful projections may di&s;|appear, and their place be occupied by a dead
<PB N="ix" REF="10">
flat. All the author could do to obviate difficulties of this kind, was to &s;pecify in general, under what kind of light and weather, the &s;everal land&s;capes he &s;aw, were exhibited.</P>
<P>In his views of lake-&s;cenery indeed (which form the principal part of the following work) he has le&s;s cau&s;e to fear; and offers his ob&s;er|vations with more confidence. Among the&s;e &s;cenes he re&s;ted &s;ome time: and tho he &s;aw each &s;cene but once; yet as he &s;pent near a week among them, he &s;aw &s;o much of their varieties, that he could make allowances for the effects of light and weather; and could &s;peak of them, in general, with more preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>He is under another apprehen&s;ion from the variations, which <HI>time,</HI> as well as <HI>weather,</HI> produces in &s;cenery. Even the wild features of nature &s;uffer continual change from various cau&s;es&mdash;inclo&s;ures&mdash;canals&mdash;quarries&mdash;build|ings &mdash;and, above all, from the growth, or
<PB N="x" REF="11">
de&s;truction, of timber. And if the wild &s;cenes of nature &s;uffer change; how much more may we expect to ob&s;erve it in the improvement of particular places, which are profe&s;&s;edly alter|ing with the ta&s;te, or fancy of their owners? Few of the&s;e &s;cenes continue long the &s;ame. The growth of trees, and &s;hrubs is continually making changes in them, even in a natural cour&s;e. It is probable therefore, that many of the embelli&s;hed &s;cenes, de&s;cribed in the follow|ing work, are now totally changed; and that the author hath rather exhibited a hi&s;tory of the pa&s;t, than a repre&s;entation of the pre&s;ent. Thirteen, or fourteen years bring a &s;hrub to perfection. After that period, if the knife be not freely u&s;ed, a &s;hrubbery, from mere natural cau&s;es, will of it&s;elf decay.</P>
<P>Lake-&s;cenery, it is true, is le&s;s &s;ubject to change. The broader the features are, the le&s;s they will vary. Water, which makes the grand part of this kind of &s;cenery, remains un|altered by time: and the rocks, and mountains, which inviron the lake, are as little &s;ubject to
<PB N="xi" REF="12">
variation, as any of the materials of land&s;cape can be. Wood is the only feature, which can have &s;uffered any con&s;iderable change. In this indeed great deva&s;tation hath been made in &s;e|veral of the northern lakes, e&s;pecially in that of Ke&s;wick.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e beautiful &s;cenes produced formerly great quantities of valuable timber; which adorned the banks of the lake, and inriched it's lofty &s;kreens. But after the rebellion of the year 1715; the&s;e lands, together with all the other e&s;tates of the unfortunate earl of Derwentwater, were forfeited to the crown; and were given by George I. to increa&s;e the endowment of Greenwich-ho&s;pital; the tru&s;|tees of which immediately &s;old, and cut down, almo&s;t all the timber.</P>
<P>Before this depredation, the lake of Ke&s;wick was a glorious &s;cene. No one however now remembers it in it's &s;plendor. Since that time it hath &s;uffered little change. Yet &s;ome it hath &s;uffered. Two woods, neither of them incon&s;iderable, on the two oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the
<PB N="xii" REF="13">
lake, one belonging to the Derwentwater e&s;tate, the other to lord Egremont, have been de|&s;troyed. The author u&s;es the word <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> becau&s;e of the barbarous method of cutting timber, which prevails in the northern coun|ties. In the &s;outh of England the proprietor &s;ends an experienced &s;urveyor into his woods, who marks &s;uch timber as is fit for the axe; leaving all the young thriving trees behind. The wood therefore, if fenced, &s;oon rears again its ancient honours, and becomes a pe|rennial nur&s;ery. In the north it is otherwi&s;e. There the merchant agrees for the wood alto|gether as it &s;tands; and the proprietor, for the &s;ake of a pre&s;ent advantage, &s;uffers him to lay the whole flat. Nothing but a cop&s;e &s;prings up in its room; and all &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of timber is prevented. This hath operated, among other cau&s;es, in the general de&s;truction of timber in the northern counties.</P>
<P>The author believes the lake of Ke&s;wick hath &s;uffered the&s;e two la&s;t mentioned depre|dations &s;ince the following remarks were made:
<PB N="xiii" REF="14">
but as he is informed the underwood hath in|crea&s;ed con&s;iderably, and hath in many parts added &s;ome degree of richne&s;s to the moun|tains, and promontaries around the lake; he is not apprehen&s;ive, that any changes, in &s;o &s;hort an interval, can in any material way affect his de&s;criptions. It is true, there will ever be a great difference between the grandeur of a wood, and the poverty of a cop&s;e; and <HI>on the &s;pot</HI> it will be evident enough: but in all the <HI>di&s;tances</HI> of the&s;e exten&s;ive views, it will not &s;o ea&s;ily be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Another ground of the author's apprehen|&s;ion, is, that he may be thought too &s;evere in his &s;trictures <HI>on &s;cenes of art.</HI> The grand natural &s;cene, will always appear &s;o &s;uperior to the embelli&s;hed artificial one; that the pic|ture&s;que eye in contemplating the former, will be too apt to look contemptuou&s;ly on the latter. This is ju&s;t as arrogant, as to de&s;pi&s;e a propriety, becau&s;e it cannot be cla&s;&s;ed with
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">
a cardinal virtue. Each mode of &s;cenery hath it's &s;tation. A wild fore&s;t &s;cene contiguous to a noble man&s;ion, would be ju&s;t as ab&s;urd; as an embelli&s;hed one, in the mid&s;t of a fore&s;t.</P>
<P>A hou&s;e is an <HI>artificial</HI> object; and the &s;cenery around it, <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> in &s;ome degree, par|take of <HI>art.</HI> Propriety requires it: conve|nience demands it. But if it partake of <HI>art,</HI> as allied to the <HI>man&s;ion;</HI> it &s;hould al&s;o partake of <HI>nature,</HI> as allied to the <HI>country.</HI> It has therefore two characters to &s;upport; and may be con&s;idered as the connecting thread between the regularity of the hou&s;e, and the freedom of the natural &s;cene. The&s;e two characters it &s;hould ever have in view.</P>
<P>Under this regulation, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the embelli&s;hed &s;cene, is to make every thing con|venient, and comfortable around the hou&s;e&mdash;to remove offen&s;ive objects, and to add a plea&s;ing foreground to the di&s;tance. If there be no di&s;tance, it mu&s;t depend the more on it's own beauties. But &s;till, in every circum&s;tance, it mu&s;t well ob&s;erve it's double character;
<PB N="xv" REF="16">
and di&s;cover as much of the &s;implicity of nature, as is con&s;i&s;tent with it's artificial al|liance. If the &s;cene be large, it throws off art, by degrees, the more it recedes from the man&s;ion, and approaches the country.</P>
<P>It is true, we cannot well admit the em|belli&s;hed &s;cene among objects <HI>purely picture&s;que.</HI> It is too trim, and neat for the pencil; which ever delights in the bold, free, negligent &s;trokes, and roughne&s;&s;es of nature&mdash;abhorring, in it's wild &s;allies, the lea&s;t intru&s;ion of art&mdash;or how|ever allowing only the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch ob|jects, as have about them the carele&s;sne&s;s, the &s;implicity, and the freedom of nature. Such in a particular manner are ruins. Objects indeed of a more formal kind, as buildings, and &s;hip|ping, are &s;uffered&mdash;&s;ometimes for the &s;ake of contra&s;t&mdash;and &s;ometimes for the plea&s;ing ideas they excite: but as objects of picture&s;que beauty, we utterly reject them, till they have depo&s;ited all their &s;quare formalities. The building mu&s;t be thrown into per&s;pective; the &s;hip fore-&s;hortened, and it's &s;ails varied, before they
<PB N="xvi" REF="17">
mu&s;t pre&s;ume to attract the notice of the picture&s;que eye.</P>
<P>The embelli&s;hed &s;cene hath &s;till more of this formal mixture. But tho it is not enough marked with the bold, free characters of nature, to be purely picture&s;que; it is &s;till, under it's proper regulations, a very beautiful &s;pecies of land&s;cape. It hath beauties peculiar to it&s;elf; and if it a&s;toni&s;h us not with grandeur, and &s;ublimity; it plea&s;es with &s;ymmetry, and elegance.</P>
<P>In the body of his book, the author hath ventured to call the <HI>embelli&s;hed &s;cene,</HI> one of the peculiar features of Engli&s;h land&s;cape<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 9.</NOTE>. But we mu&s;t &s;till lament, that this beautiful mode of compo&s;ition, is oftener aimed at, than at|tained. It's double alliance with art, and nature, is rarely ob&s;erved with perfect impar|tiality. Ambitious ornaments generally take the lead; and nature is left behind.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="18">Where little improprieties offend, they are readily pa&s;&s;ed over. But where the offence again&s;t nature becomes capital, it is not ea&s;y to repre&s;s indignation.</P>
<P>In &s;o exten&s;ive a tour as the following pages contain, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a variety of very di&s;gu&s;ting &s;cenes of this kind would occur &mdash;&s;cenes, in which nature was forced&mdash;in which &s;he was arrayed in alien beauties&mdash;or overloaded with tawdry ornaments. In truth, &s;uch &s;cenes often did occur. But the author, however &s;evere he may be thought, hath endeavoured to proceed on principles, which he hoped could not rea&s;onably give offence. He &s;tudiou&s;ly checked all &s;everity of critici&s;m, where the im|prover <HI>&s;till enjoyed his &s;cene.</HI> It would have hurt him to have di&s;turbed the <HI>innocent,</HI> (tho perhaps <HI>ta&s;tele&s;s,</HI>) amu&s;ements of any one. Tho he &s;hould not have cho&s;en to &s;peak &s;enti|ments not his own: yet he could always be &s;ilent; or look a&s;ide, where he did not wi&s;h to examine. But where the improver of the &s;cene was dead, e&s;pecially when his works were
<PB N="xviii" REF="19">
<HI>publi&s;hed,</HI> by being thrown open to curio&s;ity; the author thought him&s;elf at perfect liberty. All &s;uch &s;cenes he con&s;idered as fair game. He hath without &s;cruple therefore remarked freely upon them; and hath endeavoured to point out the many &s;trange errors, and ab&s;urdities, to which an inattention to nature hath given birth:
<Q><L>&mdash; quorum, velut aegri &s;omnia, vanae</L>
<L>Finguntur &s;pecies: ut nec pes, nec caput uni</L>
<L>Reddatur formae&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>But even here he hath avoided <HI>all general, unmarked cen&s;ure,</HI> which he con&s;iders as the garb of <HI>&s;lander.</HI> He hath always accompanied his <HI>critici&s;ms</HI> with <HI>rea&s;ons;</HI> and if the rea&s;on have no force, the critici&s;m falls of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>It may be objected perhaps, that the author hath wrought up many of his de&s;criptions, in the following work, higher, than the &s;impli|city of pro&s;aic language may allow. Simplicity, no doubt, is the foundation of beauty in every
<PB N="xix" REF="20">
&s;pecies of compo&s;ition: but the &s;implicity of a familiar letter differs from the &s;implicity of hi&s;tory; and the &s;implicity of a poem, from the &s;implicity of both&mdash;that is, one work may be more highly coloured than another; and wrought up with warmer language, and a greater variety of images. Now the following work, at lea&s;t the de&s;criptive parts of it, ap|proach as near the idea of poetic compo&s;ition, as any kind of pro&s;aic writing can do. It is the aim of <HI>picture&s;que de&s;cription</HI> to bring the images of nature, as forcibly, and as clo&s;ely to the eye, as it can; and this mu&s;t often be done by high-colouring; which this &s;pecies of com|po&s;ition demands. By <HI>high-colouring</HI> is not meant <HI>a &s;tring of rapturous epithets,</HI> (which is the feeble&s;t mode of de&s;cription) but an attempt to analize the views of nature&mdash;to open their &s;e|veral parts, in order to &s;hew the effect of a whole&mdash; to mark their tints, and varied lights&mdash;and to expre&s;s all this detail in terms as appropriate, and yet as vivid, as po&s;&s;ible. In attempting this, if the language be <HI>forced,</HI> and <HI>inflated,</HI> no doubt
<PB N="xx" REF="21">
it is the ju&s;t object of critici&s;m: but if, tho highly coloured, it keep within the
<Q>De&s;criptas vices, operi&s;que colores,</Q>
it may be hoped, it will e&s;cape cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>The author fears too, he may be called on to apologize for the many digre&s;&s;ions he hath made. But if in this point he hath erred; he hath erred with his be&s;t judgment. Whether his work be con&s;idered as didactic, or de&s;crip|tive (as in fact it is intended to be a &s;pecies between both) he thought it wanted &s;ome little occa&s;ional relief. Travelling continually among rocks, and mountains; hills, and vallies; and remarking upon them, he feared might be tedious: and therefore, when any ob&s;ervations, anecdote, or hi&s;tory, grew naturally from his &s;ubject, he was glad to take the advantage of it; and draw the reader a little a&s;ide, that he might return to the principal object with le&s;s &s;atiety. This too is poetic licence. What in
<PB N="xxi" REF="22">
argument would be ab&s;urd; in works of amu&s;e|ment may be nece&s;&s;ary. If any of the&s;e di|gre&s;&s;ions however &s;hould appear forced&mdash;out of place&mdash;or unconnected with the &s;ubject; for <HI>them</HI> he wi&s;hes to apologize.</P>
<P>The author hopes no one will be &s;o &s;evere, as to think a work of this kind (tho a work only of amu&s;ement) incon&s;i&s;tent with the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of a clergyman. He means not to addre&s;s him&s;elf to the lax notions of the age; to which he is no way apprehen&s;ive of giving offence: but he &s;hould be &s;orry to hurt the feelings of the mo&s;t &s;erious. How far field &s;ports, and a variety of other diver&s;ions, which may be proper in &s;ome &s;tations, are quite agreeable to the clerical one, is a &s;ubject he means not to di&s;cu&s;s: Yet &s;urely the &s;tudy of nature, in every &s;hape, is allowable; and affords amu&s;e|ment, which the &s;evere&s;t cannot well repre|hend&mdash;the &s;tudy of the heavens&mdash;of the earth&mdash; of the field&mdash;of the garden, it's productions,
<PB N="xxii" REF="23">
fruits, and flowers&mdash;of the bowels of the earth, containing &s;uch amazing &s;tores of curio&s;ity&mdash; and of animal life, through all it's a&s;toni&s;hing varieties, even to the &s;hell, and the in&s;ect. Among the&s;e objects of rational amu&s;ement, may we not enumerate al&s;o the beautiful ap|pearances of the face of nature?</P>
<P>The ground indeed, which the author hath taken, that of examining land&s;cape by the <HI>rules of picture&s;que beauty,</HI> &s;eems rather a deviation from <HI>nature</HI> to <HI>art.</HI> Yet, in fact, it is not &s;o: for the <HI>rules of picture&s;que beauty,</HI> we know, are drawn from <HI>nature:</HI> &s;o that to examine the face of nature by the&s;e rules, is no more than to examine nature by her own mo&s;t beautiful exertions. Thus Shake&s;pear:
<Q><L>&mdash;There is an art,</L>
<L>Which does mend Nature&mdash;change it rather: but</L>
<L>That art it&s;elf is Nature&mdash;</L></Q>
The author however hopes, he &s;hould not greatly err, if he allowed al&s;o the amu&s;ements furni&s;hed by the three &s;i&s;ter-arts, to be all very con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;t rules of the clerical profe&s;&s;ion. The only danger is, le&s;t the <HI>amu&s;e|ment</HI>
<PB N="xxiii" REF="24">
&mdash;the fa&s;cinating amu&s;ement&mdash;&s;hould pre&s;s on improperly, and interfere too much with the <HI>employment.</HI></P>
<P>In a little work of the picture&s;que kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations on the River Wye and &s;everal parts of South Wales.</NOTE>, which the author printed about three years ago, he gave &s;everal drawings under the character of <HI>portraits;</HI> rather induced by the partiality of his friends, than his own judgment. He was &s;en&s;ible, that &s;ketches taken in the ha&s;ty manner, in which tho&s;e were taken, could not pretend to the accuracy nece&s;&s;ary in portrait. He endeavoured however to guard his readers again&s;t con&s;idering them as &s;uch, by &s;aying, they meant only <HI>to give &s;ome idea of the general effect of a &s;cene; but in no degree to mark the &s;everal picture&s;que, and ornamental particulars, of which it is compo&s;ed.</HI> But he him&s;elf thought; and &s;o, he doubts not, did the public, that this was an in&s;ufficient apology: for they were
<PB N="xxiv" REF="25">
certainly not accurate enough to give even the <HI>general effect of a &s;cene.</HI></P>
<P>In the drawings pre&s;ented in this work, he hath followed more his own judgment. Ex|cept a few, he hath given nothing, that pre|tends to the name of <HI>portrait;</HI> &s;en&s;ible, that the ha&s;ty drawings he made in this tour, (which were certainly made without any intention of publication,) did not de&s;erve it. Indeed Mr. Farington's prints render any other <HI>portraits</HI> of the lakes unnece&s;&s;ary. They are by far, in the author's opinion, the mo&s;t accurate, and beautiful views of that romantic country, which he hath &s;een. The fall of Lodoar; and the view of Derwentwater, with the mountain of Skiddaw as a back-ground, from Brandelow woods, are particularly fine.&mdash;The principal drawings which are pre&s;erved in the following work, are of two kinds.</P>
<P>One kind is meant to <HI>illu&s;trate and explain picture&s;que ideas.</HI> This indeed may be con|&s;idered among the mo&s;t u&s;eful aids of the pen|cil. <HI>Intellectual ideas</HI> it cannot reach: but
<PB N="xxv" REF="26">
<HI>picture&s;que ideas</HI> are all cloathed in <HI>bodily forms;</HI> and may often be explained better by a few &s;trokes of the pencil, than by a volume of the mo&s;t laboured de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The other &s;ort of drawings is meant to <HI>characterize the countries,</HI> through which the reader is carried. The ideas are taken from the <HI>general face of the country;</HI> not from any <HI>particular &s;cene.</HI> And indeed this may per|haps be the mo&s;t u&s;eful way of conveying local ideas. For a <HI>portrait</HI> characterizes only a <HI>&s;ingle &s;pot.</HI> The idea mu&s;t be relinqui&s;hed, as &s;oon as the place is pa&s;&s;ed. But &s;uch imaginary views as give <HI>a general idea of a country,</HI> &s;pread them&s;elves more diffu&s;ely; and are carried, in the reader's imagination, through the <HI>whole de&s;cription.</HI></P>
<P>But whatever becomes of their <HI>utility,</HI> they are beyond all doubt, the <HI>mo&s;t picture&s;que</HI> kind of drawings. Portraits may be faithful: but they are rarely in every part beautiful. The di&s;tance may be fine&mdash;the ruin may be elegant; yet will there always be &s;ome awkwardne&s;s, in
<PB N="xxvi" REF="27">
one part or other, which you would wi&s;h to remove. But truth forbids. If you are de|termined to call nothing a <HI>portrait,</HI> but what is <HI>exactly</HI> copied from nature, you mu&s;t take it as it is; good and bad; and make the be&s;t of it.</P>
<P>The fact is, you may often find a <HI>beautiful di&s;|tance.</HI> Remote objects, tho &s;ometimes awkward, do not always &s;trike the eye with their awkward|ne&s;&s;es. The ob&s;curity, occa&s;ioned by the in|tervening medium, &s;oftens each line, or tint, that is har&s;h, or di&s;cordant. But as the land&s;cape <HI>advances on the eye,</HI> the deformity grows more apparent; and on the <HI>fore-ground,</HI> objects are &s;o magnified, that it is very rare indeed, if they do not in &s;ome part, offend. Their features become then &s;o &s;trong, that if they be not beautiful, they are di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>On the other hand, he who works <HI>from imagination</HI>&mdash;that is, he who culls from na|ture the mo&s;t beautiful parts of her productions &mdash;a <HI>di&s;tance</HI> here; and there a <HI>fore-ground</HI>&mdash; combines them artificially; and removing every
<PB N="xxvii" REF="28">
thing offen&s;ive, admits only &s;uch parts, as are <HI>congruous,</HI> and <HI>beautiful;</HI> will in all probability, make a much better land&s;cape, than he who takes all as it comes; and without &s;electing beauties, copies only what he &s;ees pre&s;ented in each particular &s;cene.</P>
<P>But you wi&s;h for the repre&s;entation of &s;ome <HI>particular &s;cene.</HI> It is truth you de&s;ire, and not fiction.</P>
<P>Who objects? But even here you mu&s;t allow a little to the imagination, or your &s;cene will probably never plea&s;e. What is it that you <HI>admire?</HI> Is it <HI>the &s;pot you &s;tand on?</HI> Or, is it the grandeur of <HI>&s;ome lake</HI>&mdash;a <HI>cove of moun|tains</HI> &mdash;an <HI>inriched di&s;tance</HI>&mdash;the <HI>windings</HI> of a noble river&mdash;or &s;ome other exhibition, which is in fact much to be admired? This noble &s;cene, whatever it is, you wi&s;h to &s;ee &s;et off to the be&s;t advantage. In order therefore to give this advantage to the <HI>part you admire,</HI> you mu&s;t allow your arti&s;t to take &s;ome liberty with the <HI>ground he &s;tands on;</HI> which is evidently <HI>not</HI>
<PB N="xxviii" REF="29">
the part you admire; and probably abounds with deformities.</P>
<P>It is not meant to give him licence in&s;tead of liberty. Of the grand exhibition before him, which is the portrait you want, he mu&s;t take a faithful copy. If <HI>it</HI> pre&s;ent any &s;triking de|formity, it is not a &s;ubject for the pencil: it &s;hould be relinqui&s;hed. But if it be pure in all it's parts, the fore-ground &s;hould be made equal to it. Yet nothing &s;hould be introduced alien to the &s;cene pre&s;ented. Such alterations only your arti&s;t &s;hould make, as the nature of the country allows, and the beauty of compo&s;ition requires. Trees he may generally plant, or remove, at plea&s;ure. If a withered &s;tump &s;uit the form of his land&s;cape better than the &s;pread|ing oak, which he finds in nature, he may make the exchange&mdash;or he may make it, if he wi&s;h for a &s;preading oak, where he finds a withered trunk: He has no right, we allow, to add a magnificent ca&s;tle&mdash;an impending rock&mdash;or a river, to adorn his fore-ground. The&s;e are <HI>new features.</HI> But he may certainly
<PB N="xxix" REF="30">
break an ill-formed hillock; and &s;hovel the earth about him, as he plea&s;es, without offence. He may pull up a piece of awkward paling&mdash; he may throw down a cottage&mdash;he may even turn the cour&s;e of a road, or a river, a few yards on this &s;ide, or that. The&s;e trivial al|terations may greatly add to the beauty of his compo&s;ition; and yet they interfere not with the truth of <HI>portrait.</HI> Mo&s;t of the&s;e things may <HI>in fact</HI> be altered to-morrow; tho they di&s;gu&s;t to-day. The road and the river, it is true, keep their &s;tation: but the change you de&s;ire, is &s;o trifling; that the eye of truth can never be offended; tho the picture&s;que eye may be exceedingly gratified. There is a very beautiful &s;cene on the banks of the Tay near Perth, which in compo&s;ition is correctly pic|ture&s;que; except only that the river forming two parallel lines with the &s;ides of the picture, enters the fore-ground at right angles. So offen&s;ive a form could not but injure the beauty of any land&s;cape. Would the truth of portrait be injured, in painting this &s;ubject, if trees
<PB N="xxx" REF="31">
were planted to hide the deformity; or a &s;mall turn given to the river, to break it's di&s;gu&s;t|ing regularity?</P>
<P>The author means not however to offer the <HI>portraits,</HI> and <HI>illu&s;trations</HI> he hath here given, as perfect examples of the principles he hath laid down. It is a difficult matter for any arti&s;t (at lea&s;t, who does not claim as a pro|fe&s;&s;ional man) to reach his own ideas. What he repre&s;ents will ever fall &s;hort of what he ima|gines. With regard to <HI>figures</HI> particularly, the author wi&s;hes to premi&s;e, that the rules laid down in the beginning of the &s;econd volume (page 43, &amp;c.) are here little ob&s;erved. Tho&s;e remarks were chiefly intended for works in a larger &s;tyle. Figures on &s;o &s;mall a &s;cale as the&s;e, are not capable of receiving character. They are at be&s;t only what he calls <HI>pictu|re&s;que appendages.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the repre&s;entations here given have again &s;u&s;tained a lo&s;s by going through a tran&s;|lation in &s;o rough and unmanageable a lan|guage, as that of bra&s;s, and aquafortis. The
<PB N="xxxi" REF="32">
mode of etching cho&s;en, is the newly invented one of aqua-tinta; which is certainly the &s;ofte&s;t, and comes the neare&s;t to the idea of drawing. But this &s;pecies of etching it&s;elf, tho even managed by a ma&s;terly hand, is &s;ub|ject to great inconveniences; e&s;pecially when a large number of prints are taken from one plate. It is impo&s;&s;ible to make lights graduate as they ought&mdash;to keep di&s;tances pure &mdash;and to give tho&s;e &s;trong characteri&s;tic touches to objects, which may be done with a bru&s;h in <HI>drawing.</HI> Unavoidable defects however the candid will excu&s;e; and may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that the author took all the pains he could, by correcting the proofs, to make the plates, what he wi&s;hed them.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON Several PARTS of ENGLAND, ESPECIALLY The LAKES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we make any ob&s;ervations on the picture&s;que beauty of particular places, it may not be ami&s;s to take a &s;light view of tho&s;e great features, on which picture&s;que beauty in land&s;cape &s;o much depends.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t the whole of the <HI>we&s;tern</HI> coa&s;t of England is mountainous, and rocky: and, as
<PB N="2" REF="50">
it approaches the &s;ea, it is often &s;cooped into large bays, and inlets, invironed by promonto|ries.</P>
<P>On the <HI>ea&s;tern</HI> &s;ide, the coa&s;t con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of low, flat, &s;andy &s;hores; from the mouth of the Thames, as far as Scarborough in York|&s;hire; where the coa&s;t fir&s;t becomes rocky. At this point, it deviates &s;o much from the general character, it has thus far maintained; that the river Derwent, which ri&s;es very near the &s;ea, in&s;tead of entering it directly, retires from it; and joins the Humber, at the di&s;|tance of forty miles.&mdash;From Scarborough the ea&s;tern coa&s;t a&s;&s;umes the character of the we&s;tern; and is more or le&s;s rocky, as far as the Tweed.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;outhern</HI> coa&s;t, lying between countries of &s;uch different characters, participates of both.</P>
<P>Such is the general idea of the great <HI>bounda|ries</HI> of England.</P>
<P>If we leave the coa&s;t, and take a view of the internal parts of the country, we find the <HI>&s;outhern</HI> counties much varied with- hill and dale. The <HI>we&s;tern</HI> rather approach the moun|tainous character; almo&s;t the whole of Wales
<PB N="3" REF="51">
is in that &s;tyle of land&s;cape. But in the <HI>mid|land,</HI> and <HI>ea&s;tern</HI> parts, we &s;carce find any ele|vation that de&s;erves to be mentioned: they are generally level; till we arrive near the centre of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>In Derby&s;hire the fir&s;t mountainous coun|try begins. There the high lands forming them&s;elves by degrees into a chain of moun|tains, direct their cour&s;e towards the north-we&s;t. They fir&s;t divide Lanca&s;hire from York|&s;hire: then entering We&s;tmoreland, they &s;pread them&s;elves over the whole of that county, and a part of Cumberland. Again contracting them|&s;elves into a chain, and forming the limits be|tween Cumberland, and Northumberland, they continue their cour&s;e northward; and enter Scotland.&mdash;It is in the various parts of this va&s;t combination of mountains, to which we may add tho&s;e of Wales, where the admirers of the beautiful and &s;ublime in Engli&s;h land&s;cape are chiefly gratified.</P>
<P>There is another grand feature, that may be noticed in the internal parts of England; and that is, the va&s;t beds of chalk, which are found in various parts.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="52">A chalky &s;oil has indeed not &s;o great an effect on the picture&s;que form of a country, as rocks and mountains; and yet it's effect is not incon|&s;iderable. It generally produces a peculiar &s;tyle of land&s;cape&mdash;an impoveri&s;hed kind; without the grandeur of the rocky country; or the chear|ful luxuriance of the &s;ylvan. It runs out com|monly into wide, diffu&s;ive downs; &s;welling into frequent elevations. The&s;e are it's u&s;ual cha|racters, where the chalk approaches neare&s;t the &s;urface: but as it runs at various depths; it has, of cour&s;e, in many places very little effect on land&s;cape. In the lower grounds, where the rains, through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, have wa&s;hed the &s;oil from the higher, you &s;ee often a very luxuriant vegetation.</P>
<P>The great central <HI>patria</HI> of chalk, if I may &s;o phra&s;e it, &s;eems to be in the contiguous parts of Berk&s;hire, Wilt&s;hire, Dor&s;et&s;hire, and Hamp|&s;hire. From this va&s;t bed, three principal ridges of it extend.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t leaving Berk&s;hire, cro&s;&s;es the Thames; and running northward through Buckingham|&s;hire, enters Bedford&s;hire, and ends about Dun|&s;table; beyond which, chalk is never found.</P>
<P>A &s;econd running ea&s;tward, occupies great part of Surrey; and turning near Dartford to
<PB N="5" REF="53">
the &s;outh-ea&s;t, continues in that direction, form|ing high grounds, till it meet the &s;ea abruptly at Dover.</P>
<P>The third great ridge takes a more &s;outherly cour&s;e, occupying a va&s;t tract, near eighty miles in length, tho &s;carce any where above four miles broad, which is known by the name of the South-downs of Su&s;&s;ex. Ports-down may be con&s;idered as a branch of this ridge.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e three great ridges, it appears in a few other detached parts; but very rarely.</P>
<P>Similar remarks might be made, with &s;ome accuracy, on the effects, which other &s;oils have on land&s;cape. But as the&s;e effects, are not &s;o &s;triking; I wi&s;h not to appear refined. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve in general, that the variety and intermixture of &s;oils, and &s;trata, in this i&s;land, are very great.</P>
<P>From whatever cau&s;e it proceeds, certain, I believe, it is, that this country exceeds mo&s;t countries in the <HI>variety</HI> of it's picture&s;que beau|ties. I &s;hould not wi&s;h to &s;peak merely as an Engli&s;hman: the &s;uffrages of many travellers,
<PB N="6" REF="54" MS="y">
and foreigners, of ta&s;te, I doubt not, might be adduced.</P>
<P>In &s;ome or other of the <HI>particular &s;pecies</HI> of land&s;cape, it may probably be excelled. Swit|zerland may perhaps exceed it in the beauty of it's wooded vallies; Germany, in it's river-views; and Italy, in it's lake-&s;cenes. But if it yield to &s;ome of the&s;e countries in <HI>particular</HI> beauties; I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that on the <HI>whole,</HI> it tran&s;cends them all. It exhibits perhaps more variety of hill, and dale, and level ground, than is any where to be &s;een in &s;o &s;mall a com|pa&s;s. It's rivers a&s;&s;ume every character, diffu|&s;ive, winding and rapid. It's e&s;tuaries, and coa&s;t-views are varied, of cour&s;e, from the form, and rockine&s;s of it's &s;hores. It's moun|tains, and lakes, tho they cannot perhaps rival, as I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, &s;ome of the choice lakes of Italy&mdash;about Tivoli e&s;pecially, where the mo&s;t perfect models of this kind of land&s;cape are &s;aid to be pre&s;ented; are yet in <HI>variety,</HI> I pre|&s;ume, equal to the lake-&s;cenery of any country.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the <HI>variety</HI> of it's beauties, in &s;ome or other of which it may be rivalled; it
<PB N="7" REF="55">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome beauties, which are <HI>peculiar</HI> to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e peculiar features ari&s;es from the <HI>intermixture</HI> of wood and cultivation, which is found oftener in Engli&s;h land&s;cape, than in the land&s;cape of other countries. In France, in Italy, in Spain, and in mo&s;t other places, cul|tivation, and wood have their &s;eparate limits. Trees grow in detached woods; and cultivation occupies va&s;t, unbounded common fields. But in England, the cu&s;tom of dividing property by hedges, and of planting hedge-rows, &s;o uni|ver&s;ally prevails, that almo&s;t wherever you have cultivation, there al&s;o you have wood.</P>
<P>Now altho this regular intermixture produces often deformity on the nearer grounds; yet, at a di&s;tance it is the &s;ource of great beauty. On the &s;pot, no doubt, and even in the fir&s;t di&s;|tances, the marks of the &s;pade, and the plough; the hedge, and the ditch; together with all the formalities of hedge-row trees, and &s;quare di|vi&s;ions of property, are di&s;gu&s;ting in a high de|gree. But when all the&s;e regular forms are &s;oftened by di&s;tance&mdash;when hedge-row trees begin to unite, and lengthen into &s;treaks along
<PB N="8" REF="56">
the horizon&mdash;when farm-hou&s;es, and ordinary buildings lo&s;e all their vulgarity of &s;hape, and are &s;cattered about, in formle&s;s &s;pots, through the &s;everal parts of a di&s;tance&mdash;it is inconceiva|ble what richne&s;s, and beauty, this ma&s;s of de|formity, when melted together, adds to land|&s;cape. One va&s;t tract of wild, uncultivated country, unle&s;s either varied by large parts, or under &s;ome peculiar circum&s;tances of light, cannot produce the effect. Nor is it produced by unbounded tracts of cultivation; which, without the intermixture of wood, cannot give richne&s;s to di&s;tance.&mdash;Thus Engli&s;h land&s;cape affords a &s;pecies of <HI>rich di&s;tance,</HI> which is rarely to be found in any other country.&mdash;You have likewi&s;e from this intermixture of wood and cultivation, the advantage of being &s;ure to find a tree or two, on the foreground, to adorn any beautiful view you may meet with in the di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Another peculiar feature in the land&s;cape of this country, ari&s;es from the great quantity of Engli&s;h oak, with which it abounds. The oak of no country has equal beauty: nor does any tree an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of &s;cenery &s;o well. The oak is the noble&s;t ornament of a
<PB N="9" REF="57">
fore-ground; &s;preading, from &s;ide to &s;ide, it's tortuous branches; and foliage, rich with &s;ome autumnal tint. In a di&s;tance al&s;o it appears with equal advantage; forming it&s;elf into beau|tiful clumps, varied more in &s;hape; and per|haps more in colour, than the clumps of any other tree. The pine of Italy has it's beauty, hanging over the broken pediment of &s;ome ruined temple. The che&s;tnut of Calabria is con|&s;ecrated by adorning the fore-grounds of Sal|vator. The elm, the a&s;h, and the beech, have all their re&s;pective beauties: but no tree in the fore&s;t is adapted to all the purpo&s;es of land&s;cape, like Engli&s;h oak.</P>
<P>Among the peculiar features of Engli&s;h land|&s;cape, may be added the embelli&s;hed garden, and park-&s;cene. In other countries the environs of great hou&s;es are yet under the direction of formality. The wonder-working hand of art, with it's regular ca&s;cades, &s;pouting fountains, flights of terraces, and other atchievements, have &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gardens of kings, and princes. In England alone the model of nature is adopted.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="58">This is a mode of &s;cenery intirely of the &s;ylvan kind. As we &s;eek among the wild works of nature for the &s;ublime, we &s;eek here for the beautiful: and where there is a variety of lawn, wood, and water; and the&s;e naturally combined; and not too much decorated with buildings, nor di&s;graced by fanta&s;tic ornaments; we find a &s;pecies of land&s;cape, which no country, but England, can di&s;play in &s;uch perfection: not only becau&s;e this ju&s;t &s;pecies of ta&s;te prevails no where el&s;e; but al&s;o, becau&s;e no where el&s;e are found &s;uch proper materials. The want of Engli&s;h oak, as we have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, can never be made up, in this kind of land&s;cape e&s;|pecially. Nor do we any where find &s;o clo&s;e and rich a verdure. An ea&s;y &s;well may, every where, be given to ground: but it cannot every where be covered with a velvet turf, which con|&s;titutes the beauty of an embelli&s;hed lawn.</P>
<P>The moi&s;ture, and vapoury heavine&s;s of our atmo&s;phere, which produces the rich verdure of our lawns; gives birth al&s;o to another pecu|liar feature in Engli&s;h land&s;cape&mdash;that ob&s;curity, which is often thrown over di&s;tance. In warmer climates e&s;pecially, the air is purer. Tho&s;e mi&s;ts
<PB N="11" REF="59">
and vapours which &s;team from the ground at night, are di&s;per&s;ed with the morning-&s;un. Under Italian &s;kies very remote objects are &s;een with great di&s;tinctne&s;s. And this mode of vi|&s;ion, no doubt, has it's beauty; as have all the works, and all the operations of nature.&mdash;But, at be&s;t, this is only one mode of vi&s;ion. Our gro&s;&s;er atmo&s;phere (which likewi&s;e hath it's &s;ea&s;ons of purity) exhibits various modes; &s;ome of which are in them&s;elves more beautiful, than the mo&s;t di&s;tinct vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;everal degrees of ob&s;curity, which the heavine&s;s of our atmo&s;phere gives to land&s;cape, may be reduced to three&mdash;<HI>hazine&s;s, mi&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>fogs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hazine&s;s</HI> ju&s;t adds that light, grey tint&mdash;that thin, dubious veil, which is often beautifully &s;pread over land&s;cape. It hides nothing. It only &s;weetens the hues of nature&mdash;it gives a con&s;equence to every common object, by giving it a more indi&s;tinct form&mdash;it corrects the glare of colours&mdash;it &s;oftens the har&s;hne&s;s of lines; and above all, it throws over the face of land|&s;cape that harmonizing tint, which blends the whole into unity, and repo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;t</HI> goes farther. It &s;preads &s;till more ob|&s;curity over the face of nature. As hazine&s;s
<PB N="12" REF="60">
&s;oftens, and adds a beauty perhaps to the <HI>cor|recte&s;t</HI> form of land&s;cape; mi&s;t is adapted to tho&s;e land&s;capes, in which we want to hide much, to &s;often more; and to throw many parts into a greater di&s;tance, than they naturally occupy.</P>
<P>Even the <HI>fog,</HI> which is the highe&s;t degree of a gro&s;s atmo&s;phere, is not without it's beauty in land&s;cape; e&s;pecially in the mountain-&s;cenes, which are &s;o much the object of the following remarks. When partial, as it often is, the effect is grande&s;t. When &s;ome va&s;t promon|tory, i&s;&s;uing from a cloud of vapour, with which all it's upper parts are blended, &s;hoots into a lake; the imagination is left at a lo&s;s to di&s;|cover, whence it comes, or to what height it a&s;pires. The effect ri&s;es with the ob&s;curity; and the view is &s;ometimes wonderfully great.</P>
<P>To the&s;e natural features, which are, in a great degree, peculiar to the land&s;cape of Eng|land, we may la&s;tly add another, of the artificial kind&mdash;the ruins of abbeys; which, being natu|ralized to the &s;oil, might indeed, without much impropriety, be cla&s;&s;ed among it's natural beau|ties.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="61">Ruins are commonly divided into two kinds; ca&s;tles, and abbeys. Of the former few coun|tries perhaps can produce &s;o many, as this i&s;land; for which various cau&s;es may be a&s;&s;igned. The feudal &s;y&s;tem, which la&s;ted long in England, and was carried high, produced a number of ca&s;tles in every part. King Stephen's reign contributed greatly to multiply them. And in the northern counties, the continued wars with Scotland had the &s;ame effect. Many of the&s;e buildings, now fallen into decay, remain ob|jects of great beauty.</P>
<P>In the ruins of ca&s;tles however, other coun|tries may compare with ours. But in the re|mains of abbeys no country certainly can.</P>
<P>Where popery prevails, the abbey is &s;till in|tire and inhabited; and of cour&s;e le&s;s adapted to land&s;cape.</P>
<P>But it is the mode of architecture, which gives &s;uch excellence to the&s;e ruins. The Gothic &s;tyle, in which they are generally com|po&s;ed, is, I apprehend, unrivalled among foreign nations; and may be called a peculiar feature in Engli&s;h land&s;cape.</P>
<P>Many of our ruins have been built in what is often called the Saxon &s;tyle. This is a coar&s;e, heavy mode of architecture; and &s;eldom affords
<PB N="14" REF="62">
a beautiful ruin. In general, the Saxon pre|vails mo&s;t in the northern counties; and the Gothic in the &s;outhern: tho each divi&s;ion of the kingdom affords &s;ome in&s;tances of both: and in many we find them mixed.</P>
<P>What we call Saxon architecture &s;eems to have been the awkward imitation of Greek, and Roman models. What buildings of Roman origin were left in England, were probably de&s;troyed by the ruthle&s;s Saxon in his early ravages. Afterwards, when Alfred the great, having e&s;tabli&s;hed government, and religion, turned his view to arts, we are told he was obliged to &s;end to the continent for architects. In what &s;pecies of architecture the buildings of this prince were compo&s;ed, we know not: but probably in a purer &s;tyle, than what we now call Saxon; as Alfred lived nearer Roman times; and perhaps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his own coun|try &s;ome of tho&s;e beautiful models which might have e&s;caped the rage of his ance&s;tors. Even now, amid&s;t all that heavine&s;s, and barbari&s;m, which we call Saxon, it is not difficult to trace &s;ome features of Roman origin. Among the ruins of Brinkburn-abbey, between Rothbury, and Warkworth, in Northumberland, we di&s;|cover in &s;ome parts even Roman elegance.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="63">This &s;pecies of architecture is &s;uppo&s;ed to have continued till the time of the cru&s;ades; when a new &s;tyle of <HI>ornament</HI> at lea&s;t, fanta&s;tic in the highe&s;t degree, began to appear. It forms a kind of compo&s;ite with the Saxon; and hath been called by &s;ome antiquarians the Saracenic: tho others di&s;allow the term. Many ruins of this kind are &s;till exi&s;ting.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h architect however began, by degrees, to &s;trike out a new mode of architec|ture for him&s;elf; without &s;earching the conti|nent for models. This is called the Gothic; but for what rea&s;on, it is hard to &s;ay: for the Goths, who were never in England, had been even forgotten, when it was invented; which was about the reign of Henry II. It is be&s;ides found no where, I believe, but in England; except in &s;uch parts of France, as were in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>In this beautiful &s;pecies of architecture the antiquarian points out three periods.</P>
<P>When it fir&s;t appeared, the round Saxon arch began to change into the pointed one; and the &s;hort, clum&s;y pillar began to clu&s;ter: but &s;till the Saxon heavine&s;s in part prevailed. Sali&s;|bury-cathedral, which was fini&s;hed about the year 1250, is generally con&s;idered as a very
<PB N="16" REF="64">
pure &s;pecimen of the Gothic, in it's fir&s;t, and ruder form.</P>
<P>By degrees improvements in architecture were introduced. The ea&s;t-window being inlarged, was trailed over with beautiful &s;crawl-work; while the clu&s;tered-pillar began to increa&s;e in height, and elegance; and to arch, and ramify along the roof. In &s;hort, an intire new mode of architecture, purely Briti&s;h, was introduced. The grandeur of the Roman&mdash;the heavine&s;s of the Saxon&mdash;and the grote&s;que ornament of the Saracenic, were all equally relinqui&s;hed. An airy lightne&s;s pervaded the whole; and orna|ments of a new invention took place. The cathedral of York, and part of Canterbury, among many others, are beautiful examples of this period of Gothic architecture.</P>
<P>About the time of the later Henries, the la&s;t period began to obtain; in the architecture of which the flat, &s;tone roof, and a variety of dif|ferent ornaments were the chief characteri&s;tics. Of this inriched &s;tyle King's college chapel in Cambridge, and Henry VII's at We&s;tmin&s;ter, are two of the mo&s;t elegant examples. The flat, &s;tone roof is generally, even at this day, con&s;idered, as a wonderful effort of art. It is &s;aid, that Sir Chri&s;topher Wren him&s;elf could
<PB N="17" REF="65">
not conceive it. He would &s;ay, <Q>Tell me where to place the fir&s;t &s;tone; and I will follow it with a &s;econd.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;tyle is generally con&s;idered as the per|fection of Gothic architecture. I own, it rather appears to me the decline of the art. The or|naments, &s;o affectedly introduced, and patched on; as the ro&s;e, and portcullis in King's college chapel, have not, in my eye, the beauty of the middle &s;tyle; in which every ornament ari&s;es naturally from the &s;everal members of the building; and makes a part of the pile it&s;elf. Nor has the flat roof, with all it's ornaments, in my opinion, the &s;implicity and beauty of the ribbed, and pointed one.</P>
<P>Abbeys formerly abounded &s;o much in Eng|land, that a delicious valley could &s;carce be found, in which one of them was not &s;tationed. The very &s;ites of many of the&s;e ancient edifices are now obliterated by the plough; yet &s;till &s;o many elegant ruins of this kind are left; that they may be called, not only one of the pecu|liar features of Engli&s;h land&s;cape; but may be ranked al&s;o among it's mo&s;t picture&s;que beau|ties.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>May 28th, 1772.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN the following tour we meant to travel the we&s;tern road, through Oxford&s;hire, War|wick&s;hire, Stafford&s;hire, Che&s;hire, and Lanca|&s;hire, into We&s;tmoreland, and Cumberland; where we propo&s;ed to make the lakes, and moun|tains the chief objects of our attention; and to return through York&s;hire, Derby&s;hire, Leice&s;|ter&s;hire and Northampton&s;hire.</P>
<P>We cro&s;&s;ed fir&s;t into the great Bath road, through King&s;ton, in Surrey, over Houn&s;low|heath; which is a dead flat, together with the country around it. You &s;eem to be always in the center of a circle of four or five miles in diameter. This flat is a little relieved by a view
<PB N="20" REF="67">
of the towers of Wind&s;or-ca&s;tle, ri&s;ing at the di&s;tance of three or four miles on the left; but it is no very con&s;iderable object from the road</P>
<P>About the twenty-fourth &s;tone the eye begins to get a little out of the circle; breaking from it into the country: but it can yet make only &s;hort excur&s;ions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;triking &s;cenery, is the woody-bank of Taplow; which, hanging over the Thames; and crowned with Cliefden-hou&s;e, &s;eated loftily among the highe&s;t woods, makes a grand ap|pearance.</P>
<P>On the road towards Henly, the views, which may be called <HI>fir&s;t di&s;tances,</HI> are not un|plea&s;ing. They con&s;i&s;t of little knolls, in va|rious &s;hapes, covered with beech.</P>
<P>The new road down Henly-hill is a noble work. From the <HI>lower</HI> grounds (when the work was new, and the chalk was continually &s;hivering from the top) it had the whim&s;ical appearance of a va&s;t &s;heet of water.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="68">Henly lies plea&s;antly at the bottom of woody hills, on the banks of the Thames: but the chalk bur&s;ting every where from the &s;oil, is di&s;agreeable. When a white &s;pot has a mean|ing, as in a wicket, or a &s;eat, if it be only a &s;pot, it may often have a good effect; but when it forces it&s;elf on the eye in large unmeaning patches, it never fails to di&s;turb the land&s;cape.</P>
<P>From Henly we &s;till continued among woody hills; but they became more detached, and un|plea&s;ing. Before we reached Nettlebed, the road pa&s;&s;ed through a beechen-grove, which la&s;ted about a mile: and on our leaving it, we were pre&s;ented with exten&s;ive di&s;tances. The&s;e roads have all been made at a great expence, as they are frequently cut through chalky hills.</P>
<P>From Ben&s;ington the ri&s;ing grounds on the left, along the Thames, at a &s;econd di&s;tance, give &s;ome little beauty to the off-&s;kip, as far as Dorche&s;ter. From thence to Oxford the country grows more flat and unplea&s;ant; running &s;ome|times
<PB N="22" REF="69">
into common fields, and &s;ometimes into barren wa&s;tes.</P>
<P>The village of Nuneham, through which the road pa&s;&s;es, was built by Lord Harcourt for his cottagers; and with that regularity, which per|haps gives the mo&s;t convenience to the dwell|ings of men. For this we readily relinqui&s;h the picture&s;que idea. Indeed I que&s;tion, whe|ther it were po&s;&s;ible for a &s;ingle hand to build a picture&s;que village. Nothing contributes more to it, than the various &s;tyles in building, which re&s;ult from the different ideas of different peo|ple. When all the&s;e little habitations happen to unite harmoniou&s;ly; and to be connected with the proper appendages of a village&mdash;a winding road&mdash;a number of &s;preading trees&mdash;a rivulet with a bridge&mdash;and a &s;pire, to bring the whole to an apex;&mdash;the village is compleat.</P>
<P>Nuneham-hou&s;e &s;tands a little out of the London road, about &s;ix miles from Oxford. The old family-&s;eat of Stanton-Harcourt, where Pope, and Gay led the mu&s;es, is now a de&s;erted ruin. It's &s;ituation was vile, compared with
<PB N="23" REF="70">
that of the pre&s;ent hou&s;e; which commands, from a ri&s;ing ground, an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect over all the intervening flat, as far as the towers of Oxford. In another direction it overlooks the windings of the Thames towards Abingdon. The&s;e grand views, terminated by the Berk|&s;hire hills, and other ri&s;ing grounds, compo&s;e the di&s;tance; and are pre&s;ented from different places around the hou&s;e; particularly from a terrace, which extends at lea&s;t a mile. The accompaniment al&s;o of noble trees on the fore-ground &s;ets off the di&s;tant &s;cenery to great ad|vantage.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t &s;triking features in the&s;e &s;cenes, is the pari&s;h-church, which was de|de&s;igned by Mr. Stuart in the form of a Grecian temple of the Ionic order.</P>
<P>We are the le&s;s able however to &s;peak with any preci&s;ion of the beauty of the&s;e &s;cenes, as a wet evening prevented our examining them, as we could have wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e is fitted up u&s;efully, and elegantly; as if intended rather for comfort, than o&s;tenta|tion. The pictures &s;eem, in general, a well-cho&s;en collection. But we had neither time, nor light to examine them thoroughly.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="71">And yet this is not &s;o di&s;advantageous a cir|cum&s;tance, as it may appear. A di&s;tinction may be made between the furniture-picture, and the cabinet one. The furniture-picture &s;hould have it's full effect as a <HI>whole.</HI> The <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> e&s;pecially, the <HI>di&s;tribution of light,</HI> and the <HI>harmony of colouring,</HI> &s;hould be well under&s;tood. The&s;e things will give it value, by plea&s;ing the eye in a tran&s;ient, unexamined view; tho it may not &s;o well bear a nicer &s;crutiny.&mdash;And indeed in forming a judgment of &s;uch a picture a cur&s;ory eye may form the be&s;t. It is not under the fa&s;cination, and delu&s;ion, which the detail of a &s;tudied picture may throw over it: but judges freely of it's <HI>general effect.</HI> At the &s;ame time, a picture, which does not thus for|cibly &s;trike the eye at once, may yet well re|ward an accurate examination; and indeed may be in it&s;elf a more valuable picture: the parts may be more excellent; the <HI>expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> the <HI>grace,</HI> the <HI>drawing,</HI> and <HI>local colouring.</HI> But what|ever excellences &s;uch a picture may po&s;&s;e&s;s, if it do not <HI>plea&s;e at &s;ight;</HI> it &s;eems fitter for a paint|er's chamber, or a curious cabinet, than for a &s;aloon, or a drawing-room.</P>
<P>Among the pictures, in this collection, which particularly plea&s;ed the eye at &s;ight, were two
<PB N="25" REF="72">
beggars by Murillo&mdash;&s;ome figures repre&s;enting night by Ca&s;telli&mdash;a land&s;cape by Daker; and another by Rui&s;dael.</P>
<P>Here are two or three hi&s;tories by Pou&s;&s;in, which having turned black with age, leave us to regret, that &s;o able a ma&s;ter, tho he was never perhaps an excellent colouri&s;t, &s;hould have been &s;o little acquainted with the nature of colours. The Flemi&s;h &s;chool, in general, &s;eem to have had the be&s;t preparations. But it might yet perhaps be u&s;eful in painting, if the nature of pigments could be brought more to a cer|tainty; and that the painter, like the apothe|cary, had a &s;ound di&s;pen&s;atory to direct his practice.</P>
<P>To enter into an examination of the &s;everal buildings, chapels, halls, libraries, pictures, and gardens of Oxford, would have engaged us in too great a work. We left Oxford therefore behind; and proceeded to Wood&s;tock.&mdash;The road &s;till continues through a flat country. It may be called a kind of cultivated drearine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="73">The heavine&s;s and enormity of Blenheim-ca&s;tle have been greatly criticized: perhaps too &s;everely. We may be too much bigotted to Greek, and Roman architecture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the following ob&s;ervations on Greek and Roman ar|chitecture, I am much indebted to Mr. Lock.</NOTE>. It was adapted often to local convenience. Under an Italian &s;un, for in&s;tance, it was of great impor|tance to exclude warmth, and give a current to air. The portico was well adapted to this pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>A &s;lavi&s;h imitation al&s;o of antique orna|ments may be carried into ab&s;urdity. When we &s;ee the &s;kulls of oxen adorning a heathen temple, we acknowledge their propriety. But it is rather unnatural to introduce them in a chri&s;tian church; where &s;acrifice would be an offence.</P>
<P>We are fettered al&s;o too much by orders, and proportions. The ancients them&s;elves paid no &s;uch clo&s;e attention to them. Our modern code was collected by average calculations from their works; by San&s;ovino particularly, and
<PB N="27" REF="74">
Palladio. But if the&s;e modern legi&s;lators of the art had been obliged to produce precedents; they could not have found any two buildings among the remains of ancient Rome, which were exactly of the &s;ame proportions.</P>
<P>I would not, by any means, wi&s;h to &s;hake off the whol&s;ome re&s;traint of tho&s;e laws of art, which have been made rules; becau&s;e they were fir&s;t rea&s;ons. All I mean is, to apologize for Vanburgh. For tho it may be difficult to plea&s;e in any other form of architecture, than what we &s;ee in daily u&s;e: yet in an art, which has not nature for it's model, the mind recoils with di&s;|dain at the idea of an <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> &s;y&s;tem. The Greeks did not imagine, that when they had invented a good thing, the faculty was exhau&s;t|ed; and incapable of producing another. Where &s;hould we have admired, at this day, the beauty of the Ionic order; if, after the Doric had been invented, it had been con&s;idered as the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of art; and every deviation from it's proportions reprobated as barbarous innovations? Vanburgh's attempt therefore &s;eems to have been an effort of genius: and if we can keep the imagination apart from the five orders, we mu&s;t allow, that he has created a <HI>magnificent whole;</HI> which is inve&s;ted with an air
<PB N="28" REF="75">
of grandeur, &s;eldom &s;een in a more regular &s;tyle of building. It's very defects, except a few that are too glaring to be overlooked, give it an appearance of &s;omething beyond com|mon; and as it is &s;urrounded with great ob|jects, the eye is &s;truck with the <HI>whole,</HI> and takes the <HI>parts</HI> upon tru&s;t. What made Van|burgh ridiculous, was, his applying to &s;mall hou&s;es, a &s;tyle of architecture, which could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ucceed, but in a large one. In a &s;mall hou&s;e, where the grandeur of a <HI>whole</HI> cannot be attempted, the eye is at lei&s;ure to contemplate <HI>parts,</HI> and meets with frequent occa&s;ion of di&s;|gu&s;t.</P>
<P>This immen&s;e pile &s;tands in the middle of an exten&s;ive park. The &s;ituation is, in general, flat. A lawn, proportioned to the hou&s;e, &s;preads in front; and, at the di&s;tance of about half a mile, meets an abrupt valley, which winds acro&s;s the park. The &s;ides of this valley are &s;hagged with well-grown wood. At the bot|tom ran once a penurious &s;tream; over which, directly oppo&s;ite to the ca&s;tle, is thrown a magnificent bridge, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;ingle arch; intended chiefly to make an ea&s;y communication between the two &s;ides of the valley.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="76">About half a mile beyond this arch is reared a triumphal column; which, tho much criticized, I own, gives me no offence; but rather &s;eems to carry on the idea of grandeur. The top is crowned with the &s;tatue of the duke of Marl|borough; and the pede&s;tal is in&s;cribed&mdash;not indeed with the ter&s;ne&s;s of a Roman altar&mdash;but with the le&s;s cla&s;&s;ical, tho more honourable de|tail of an act of parliament; granting the manor of Wood&s;tock to the duke for his eminent &s;er|vices.</P>
<P>All this &s;cenery before the ca&s;tle, is now new-modelled by the late ingenious Mr. Brown, who has given a &s;pecimen of his art, in a no|bler &s;tyle, than he has commonly di&s;played. His works are generally plea&s;ing; but here they are great.</P>
<P>About a mile below the hou&s;e, he has thrown acro&s;s the valley, a ma&s;&s;y head; which forms the rivulet into a noble lake, divided by the bridge, (which now appears properly with all the grandeur of accompaniments) into two very exten&s;ive pieces of water. Brown him&s;elf u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q>that the Thames would never forgive him, what he had done at Blenheim.</Q> And every &s;pectator mu&s;t allow, that, on entering the great gate from Wood&s;tock, the whole of this
<PB N="30" REF="77">
&s;cenery, (the ca&s;tle, the lawn, the woods, and the lake) &s;een together, makes one of the grand|e&s;t bur&s;ts, which art perhaps ever di&s;played.</P>
<P>The &s;cenery <HI>below</HI> the bridge is the mo&s;t beautiful part. The water here takes the form of a bay, running up into a wooded country; and &s;everal light &s;kiffs at anchor, impre&s;s the idea. The bay appears totally land-locked, and the ground falls ea&s;ily into it in every part.</P>
<P>Behind the hou&s;e, the improved grounds con&s;i&s;t, (in Mr. Brown's u&s;ual &s;tyle,) of a <HI>belt,</HI> as it is called, incircling a portion of the park. In this part grandeur gives way to beauty; ex|cept where the walk traver&s;es the &s;ide of the bay. Here the great idea is &s;till extended; and the banks of the Wye &s;carce exhibit more roman|tic &s;cenes, than are here di&s;played in the level plains of Oxford&s;hire. The walk carried us along the &s;ide of one woody precipice, &s;evered from another, by an expan&s;e of water, which no Engli&s;h river could furni&s;h.</P>
<P>Of this &s;ituation every advantage is taken, which could add variety to grandeur. In one part, the oppo&s;ite woody &s;hore is &s;een alone, &s;preading before the eye in a va&s;t profu&s;ion of woody &s;cenery. In another part it appears ac|companied with the lake: and &s;ometimes, it is
<PB N="31" REF="78">
only received in catches, through the woods of the fore-ground, which are generally compo&s;ed of lofty oak.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e great ideas, the &s;cene was not improved by &s;everal little patches of flowers, and flowering &s;hrubs, artificially di&s;po&s;ed, and introduced; which &s;hewed the hand of art to have been &s;traying, where the imagination would wi&s;h to be ingro&s;&s;ed by the grand exhibition of &s;implicity, and nature:
<Q><L>&mdash;"where if art</L>
<L>"E'er dared to tread, 'twas with un&s;andal'd feet,</L>
<L>"Printle&s;s, as if the place were holy ground."</L></Q>
But when we &s;aw the&s;e &s;cenes, the work was new. Time has now probably blended all the&s;e littlene&s;&s;es into an harmonious mixture with the grander parts. The mere&s;t &s;hrub may be a com|panion to the oak without offence. The offence ari&s;es only from the artificial di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>In the hou&s;e our curio&s;ity was chiefly confined to the pictures&mdash;tho&s;e of Reubens e&s;pecially; who&s;e works are here in greater excellence, and profu&s;ion, than in any collection in England. Many days would be in&s;ufficient to examine them fully. We had time only to mark their general effect.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="79"><HI>Reubens's family,</HI> by him&s;elf, con&s;i&s;ting of three figures as large as the life, is a laboured piece; and yet full of &s;pirit. The compo&s;ition, colour|ing, and harmony of the whole, are excellent. I &s;hould not &s;cruple my &s;uffrage in ranking this as the fir&s;t family-picture in England. The cha&s;t &s;implicity of the <HI>Cornaro family</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Northumberland-Hou&s;e, by Titian.</NOTE> perhaps might be excepted. I have examined, with great attention, the famous family-picture at Wilton. In that celebrated work the <HI>parts</HI> are fine, &s;ome of them extraordinarily &s;o; but the <HI>whole</HI> is ill-managed. Here the eye is not in|gro&s;&s;ed by any <HI>particular,</HI> but is filled and &s;a|tisfied with the <HI>whole;</HI> and yet may range with plea&s;ure over the <HI>parts.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Silenus</HI> al&s;o is a fini&s;hed piece; and a very noble effort of Rubens's genius, when let loo&s;e among ideal beings, in which it delighted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Holy-family</HI> &s;eems either to be damaged; or to have wanted Reubens's la&s;t hand. It is flat; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es little of the ma&s;ter's fire, except in the old woman's head.</P>
<P>The <HI>Andromeda,</HI> by Rubens, is a very fine figure.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="80">Lot leaving Sodom, is a noble work al&s;o, by the &s;ame ma&s;ter. In the colouring of this pic|ture there is a peculiar glow. In compo&s;ition it is le&s;s happy.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>FROM Wood&s;tock we proceeded to Chapel-hou&s;e, in our way to Warwick.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t &s;tage was barren of beauty. Lord Shrew&s;bury's on the right, which appears to &s;tand at the end of an exten&s;ive plantation, and has much the air of a nobleman's man&s;ion, continues long in view, and is almo&s;t the only object that engages the eye. But the unifor|mity of the woods, at a di&s;tance, is di&s;plea&s;|ing.</P>
<P>From Chapel-hou&s;e the road leads through a hilly, unplea&s;ant country. The hills are neither cloathed with wood; nor varied with broken ground&mdash;but are mere heavy lumps of earth; and the whole a barren pro&s;pect. I mean <HI>barren</HI> only in a picture&s;que light; for it affords good pa&s;turage; and is covered with
<PB N="36" REF="82">
herds of cattle; and a beautiful breed of &s;heep, with &s;ilken fleeces, and without horns.</P>
<P>And yet, among the&s;e hills, the vallies are &s;ometimes plea&s;ing. Long Compton, con&s;i&s;t|ing of a number of thatched cottages, winds plea&s;antly along the bottom of one of them: and the &s;ituation of Mr. Sheldon's at We&s;ton|park &s;eems agreeable.</P>
<P>As we enter Warwick&s;hire, near Ship&s;ton upon Stour, the hills dimini&s;h into ri&s;ing grounds; and a bleak country changes into a woody one. The &s;oil changes al&s;o from a deep clay into a gravelly, red loam; &s;prinkled with beautiful pebbles. The road leads generally through plea&s;ant lanes; leaving on the right the village of Keinton, and Edge-hill, where the unfortunate Charles fir&s;t tried his &s;ucce&s;s in arms.</P>
<P>As we approach Warwick, the country becomes &s;o flat, that the towers of the ca&s;tle make little appearance at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="83">Warwick contains many beautiful objects. The church is an elegant Gothic &s;tructure. A con&s;iderable part of it was lately burnt: but it is rebuilt with great &s;ymmetry.</P>
<P>Connected with the church is a curious chapel; decorated in the riche&s;t Gothic ta&s;te. It is the repo&s;itory of many of the chiefs of the hou&s;e of Warwick. Among them lies, under a &s;plendid monument, the celebrated Dudley, earl of Leice&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Se&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e, and the Town-hou&s;e, are both elegant buildings; e&s;pecially the for|mer.</P>
<P>The Priory, &s;ituated rather without the town, is capable of being made a plea&s;ing &s;cene. Little of the old &s;tructure remains; and what is left, is converted into a dwelling-hou&s;e. It &s;tands more elevated than mona&s;tic buildings u&s;ually did; the ground falling from it, tho gently, in almo&s;t every direction. It's pre|cincts contain about &s;ix or &s;even acres, circum|&s;cribed
<PB N="38" REF="84">
by a &s;kreen of lofty wood. Beyond this the towers of Warwick ca&s;tle, and other objects are under command.&mdash;We can only however admire the beauty of the objects; and the little advantage that hath been taken of them.</P>
<P>But the great ornament of Warwick, is the <HI>ca&s;tle.</HI> This place, celebrated once for it's &s;trength, and now for its beauty, &s;tands on a gentle ri&s;e, in the mid&s;t of a country not ab&s;olutely flat. The river Avon wa&s;hes the rock, from which it's walls ri&s;e perpendicularly. You &s;ee it's grand foundation to mo&s;t ad|vantage from the windows of the great hall; from which you look down a con&s;iderable height, upon the river.</P>
<P>This noble ca&s;tle having appeared in the different capacities, fir&s;t of a fortre&s;s, and after|wards of a county-jail; was at la&s;t converted by it's proprietor, the earl of Warwick, into a habitable man&s;ion. The old form is &s;till pre|&s;erved; at lea&s;t it may be every where traced; and each addition is in &s;ymmetry with what is left.</P>
<P>The old entrance is &s;till in u&s;e. A bridge is thrown over the ditch, and leads into the
<PB REF="85">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="39" REF="86">
inner area of the ca&s;tle, through a grand tur|rited gate. This gate is placed in the middle of a curtain; at the extremities of which &s;tand two round towers, known by the names of Guy's, and Cae&s;ar's.</P>
<P>On entering this venerable gate; and &s;urvey|ing, from it's inner arch, the area or court of the ca&s;tle, which contains about an acre; you &s;ee the ground-plot, and plan of the whole fortre&s;s.&mdash;On the left is the habitable part. In front ri&s;es a woody mount, probably artifi|cial; where formerly &s;tood the citadel, part of which &s;till remains. The area it&s;elf is covered with turf, and &s;urrounded by a broad gravel walk, as a coach-ring: and the whole is incom|pa&s;&s;ed by a wall, adorned with the ruins of towers, and other mural projections; which being &s;hattered in many places, and covered with ivy, catch little breaks of light, and often make a picture&s;que appearance.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e is grand, and convenient: the rooms &s;pacious, and comfortable. Some of the offices, particularly the kitchen, are hewn out of the &s;olid rock, on which the ca&s;tle is founded.</P>
<P>The garden con&s;i&s;ts only of a few acres; and is laid out by Brown in a clo&s;e walk, which winds towards the river; and, &s;omewhat awk|wardly,
<PB N="40" REF="87">
reverts into it&s;elf; taking no notice, except in one &s;ingle point, of the noble pile it inve&s;ts.</P>
<P>The armour, and tilting &s;pear of the cele|brated Guy, earl of Warwick, a rib of the dun cow, and other monuments of the prowe&s;s of that hero, are &s;hewn at the porter's lodge. The&s;e remains, tho fictitious, no doubt, are not improper appendages of the place; and give the imagination a kind of tinge, which throws an agreeable, romantic colour on all the ve&s;tiges of this venerable pile.</P>
<P>From Warwick we propo&s;ed to take a view of Kenelworth-ca&s;tle, which lies between it and Coventry. The country is flat, and woody.</P>
<P>Kenelworth-ca&s;tle is one of the mo&s;t magni|ficent piles of ruin in England. In the days of it's pro&s;perity, we find it often taking a military part; but in it's ruins we &s;ee little of a military air. It's light and ornamental members, in general, mark it rather as a peaceful man&s;ion.</P>
<P>This ca&s;tle is mentioned in hi&s;tory, I believe as early as the reign of Henry I. It was then private property. But it's owner taking an un|&s;ucce&s;sful part in a civil war, it fell into the
<PB N="41" REF="88">
hands of the crown: in which it continued till the time of Elizabeth, who gave it to her favourite, the earl of Leice&s;ter. This noble|man, profu&s;e, and magnificent to the la&s;t de|gree, is &s;aid to have expended &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds on this &s;ingle pile; a &s;um, enormous in tho&s;e days. Here he re&s;ided almo&s;t in regal &s;tate.</P>
<P>After the civil wars of Charles the fir&s;t, the pride of this noble man&s;ion was humbled. It's owner was a favourer of the royal cau&s;e; and Cromwell, in revenge, tore it in pieces; and &s;et every thing to auction, that could be &s;evered from the walls. The&s;e rapacious hands left it in a &s;tate, from which it never recovered; yet even &s;till it is a &s;plendid ruin.</P>
<P>From it's &s;ituation it borrows little. The eminence it &s;tands on, is too gentle to command an exten&s;ive view: and the country in it's neighbourhood is too barren of objects to fur|ni&s;h a rich one.</P>
<P>The plan of the ca&s;tle is very magnificent. The area, or walled-court, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;even acres; one third of which is occupied by the ruin. But of all this &s;uperb pile, nothing re|mains intire. The form of no chamber can well be traced; except perhaps that of the great
<PB N="42" REF="89">
banqueting-hall, which made a principal part of that range of building, which formed the centre of the pile. Among other fragments &s;tand the ruins of two ma&s;&s;y, &s;quare, di&s;&s;imilar towers, known by the names of Cae&s;ar's, and Leice&s;ter's. The&s;e &s;eem to have re&s;i&s;ted the &s;hocks of time longer than any of the other parts; but they have, at length, given way. One &s;ide of Leice&s;ter's tower, having fallen in, has laid open the whole internal &s;tructure.</P>
<P>Yet, magnificent as the&s;e ruins are, they are not picture&s;que. Neither the towers, nor any other part, nor the whole together, unle&s;s well aided by per&s;pective, and the introduction of trees to hide di&s;gu&s;ting parts, would furni&s;h a good <HI>picture;</HI> tho the variety of &s;hattered &s;tair|ca&s;es, fractured &s;egments of vaulted roofs, and pieces of ornamented windows, afford excellent <HI>&s;tudies</HI> for a painter.</P>
<P>This grand ma&s;s of ruin is now making ha&s;ty &s;trides to a total di&s;&s;olution. Another century will probably bring it all to the ground&mdash;un|le&s;s it's noble owner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Hyde.</NOTE> reach out a hand to &s;ave it. The &s;tone of which it is con&s;tructed, is

Yet not always in <HI>&s;olemn &s;ilence.</HI> About &s;even years ago, a large fragment of Leice&s;ter's tower fell down at midnight, and alarmed the neigh|bourhood far, and wide, with it's noi&s;e. And la&s;t winter an abutment of the banqueting hall fell in; and cru&s;hed a number of farming uten|&s;ils, which were depo&s;ited under it.</P>
<P>Such is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of a &s;tructure, which two hundred years ago, was &s;econd to none in England. <Q>Every room (&s;ays an old author, de&s;cribing it on the &s;pot) was &s;pacious, and high-roofed <HI>within;</HI> and every part &s;eemly to the &s;ight, by due proportion, <HI>without;</HI> in the day-time, on every &s;ide glittering with gla&s;s: at night, tran&s;parent by continual brightne&s;s of candle, fire, and torch light.</Q> &mdash;But now, in O&s;&s;ian's plaintive language, <Q>It's walls are de&s;olate: the grey mo&s;s whitens the &s;tone: the fox looks out from the win|dow; and rank gra&s;s waves round it's head.</Q></P>
<P>When we &s;aw the&s;e ruins, the area, which produces a rich verdure, was grazed by a herd
<PB N="44" REF="91">
of cattle. The&s;e were a great addition to the &s;cene, and reminded us of &s;ome of <HI>Berghem</HI>'s be&s;t pictures, in which cattle and ruins adorn each other.</P>
<P>The ground, on the out&s;ide of the ca&s;tle, was formerly floated; tho it is now entirely drained. The lake &s;pread round the &s;outhern, we&s;tern, and northern &s;ides; extending on the whole, through the &s;pace of two miles. Beyond it lay the park. On the north &s;ide was the garden, hanging on the bank, between the ca&s;tle-wall, and the water. It contained only an acre; and was joined to the park by a bridge. <Q>The left arm of the pool, northward (&s;ays the author I have ju&s;t quoted) has my Lord adorned with a beautiful bracelet of a fair-timbered bridge, fourteen feet wide, and &s;ix hundred feet long; railed on both &s;ides, and &s;trongly planted.</Q></P>
<P>The garden was laid out, as we may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, according to the ta&s;te of that day, terrace above terrace, in every mode of expen&s;ive deformity. But the lake &s;eems to have had &s;ome elegance. Indeed water &s;weeping round in the &s;hape, in which this is de&s;cribed, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be beautiful in &s;ome degree. It's &s;urface could not, like land, be injured by art: the extremities of
<PB N="45" REF="92">
it would be generally hid; and it would be con|tinually unfolding it&s;elf round the magnificent object, which it encompa&s;&s;ed: tho, it is proba|ble, it's banks were as trim, and neat, as the &s;pade, and the line could make them.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t memorable particulars of the hi&s;tory of this ca&s;tle, is an entertainment, which was given here by the earl of Leice&s;ter to queen Elizabeth. The tradition of this grand fe&s;tivity &s;till lives in the country; and we have hardly any thing equal to it on record. An ac|count of it was publi&s;hed by one Langham, a per&s;on then in office about the court, and pre|&s;ent at the time. I have already quoted from this work; and &s;hall add a part of the account he gives of her maje&s;ty's <HI>reception;</HI> from which an idea may be conceived of the gallantry of the whole entertainment.</P>
<P>On the 9th of July 1575, in the evening, the queen approaching the fir&s;t gate of the ca&s;tle, the porter, <HI>a man tall of per&s;on, and &s;tern of countenance, with a club and keys,</HI> ac|co&s;ted her maje&s;ty in a <HI>rough &s;peech, full of pa&s;&s;ion in metre, aptly made for the purpo&s;e;</HI> and demanded the cau&s;e of all this <HI>din, and
<PB N="46" REF="93">
noi&s;e, and riding about within the charge of his office?</HI> But upon &s;eeing the queen, as if he had been &s;truck in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and <HI>pierced at the pre&s;ence of a per&s;onage, &s;o evidently expre&s;&s;ing heroical &s;overeignty, he falls down on his knees, humbly prays pardon for his ignorance, yields up his club and keys, and proclaims open gates, and free pa&s;&s;age to all.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately, the trumpeters, who &s;tood on the wall, <HI>being &s;ix in number, each an eight foot high, with their &s;ilvery trumpets of a five foot long, &s;ounded up a tune of welcome.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>armonious bla&s;ters maintained their de|lectable mu&s;ic,</HI> while the queen rode through the tilt-yard, to the grand entrance of the ca&s;tle, which was wa&s;hed by the lake.</P>
<P>Here, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, a moveable i&s;land ap|proached, in which &s;at inthroned <HI>the Lady of the lake;</HI> who acco&s;ted her maje&s;ty <HI>in well penned metre,</HI> with an account of the antiquity of the ca&s;tle, and of her own &s;overeignty over tho&s;e waters, &s;ince the days of king Arthur: <HI>but that hearing her maje&s;ty was pa&s;&s;ing that way, &s;he came in humble wi&s;e to offer up the &s;ame, and all her power, into her maje&s;ty's hands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This pageant was clo&s;ed with a delectable har|mony of hautbois, &s;halms, cornets, and &s;uch other
<PB N="47" REF="94">
loud mu&s;ic, which held on, while her maje&s;ty plea|&s;antly &s;o pa&s;&s;ed into the ca&s;tle-gate.</HI></P>
<P>Here &s;he was pre&s;ented with a new &s;cene. Several of the heathen gods had brought their gifts before her, which were piled up, or hung, in elegant order, on both &s;ides of the entrance: wild-fowl, and dead game, from Sylvanus god of the woods: ba&s;kets of fruit from Pomona: &s;heaves of various kinds of corn from Ceres: a pyramid adorned with clu&s;ters of grapes, <HI>gracified with their vine-leaves,</HI> from Bacchus; and or|namented at the bottom with elegant va&s;es and goblets: fi&s;h of all &s;orts, di&s;po&s;ed in ba&s;kets, were pre&s;ented by Neptune: arms by Mars; and mu&s;ical in&s;truments by Apollo. An in&s;crip|tion over the gate explained the whole.</P>
<P>Her maje&s;ty having graciou&s;ly accepted the&s;e gifts, was received into the gates with a con|cert of flutes, and other &s;oft mu&s;ic; and alight|ing from her palfrey, (which &s;he always rode &s;ingle) &s;he was conveyed into her chamber: and her arrival was announced through the country by a peal of cannon from the ramparts; and a di&s;play of fireworks at night.</P>
<P>Here the queen was entertained nineteen days; and it is recorded, that the entertainment co&s;t the earl a thou&s;and pounds a day; each of
<PB N="48" REF="95">
which was diver&s;ified with ma&s;ks, interludes, hunting, mu&s;ic, and a variety of other amu&s;e|ments. The queen's genius &s;eems to have been greatly con&s;ulted in the pomp, and &s;olemnity of the whole. Perhaps too it was con&s;ulted, when the cla&s;&s;ical purity of the&s;e amu&s;ements relaxed; and gave way, (as we find it &s;ometimes did) to boxing, bear-baiting, and the buffoon|ery of the times.</P>
<P>Among other compliments paid to the queen, in this gallant fe&s;tival, the great clock, which was fixed in Cae&s;ar's tower, was &s;topped, du|ring her maje&s;ty's continuance in the ca&s;tle; that while the country enjoyed that great ble&s;|&s;ing, time might &s;tand &s;till.</P>

<P>FROM Kenelworth-ca&s;tle we proceeded to Coventry. The intervening country is flat.</P>
<P>The tower of Coventry church, is a beauti|ful object: but con&s;tructed of the &s;ame kind of mouldering &s;tone, which we took notice of in the ruins of Kenelworth; and which indeed is better adapted to a decayed, than to a compleat pile. The ornamental parts of this tower are ju&s;t in that &s;tate, which one would wi&s;h in a ruin: they po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ort of rich mutilation: every part is in &s;ome degree defaced; and yet the whole &s;o perfect, as to leave room for the imagination to put all together. In a <HI>ruin</HI> this is enough: but where the parts are <HI>intire,</HI> we require the ornaments to be &s;o too.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="97">As we leave Coventry, we find a red, gra|velly clay, covering a brown rock; which bur&s;ting here and there from the &s;oil, often makes a picture&s;que fore-ground. The lanes are clo&s;e; and the country woody.</P>
<P>Between Coventry, and Birmingham lies lord Aylsford's, an ancient &s;eat, but now under the hands of improvement. The hou&s;e is rebuild|ing, and the grounds are taking a new form, under the ta&s;te of Mr. Brown, who &s;eems to be doing all, that a &s;ituation, with but few ad|vantages, will allow. The hou&s;e &s;tands in the mid&s;t of a &s;cene rather flat. A rill, running near it, is changed into a river. An elegant approach is conducted over it by a hand&s;ome bridge; and a <HI>belt,</HI> winding about two miles, is the circumference of the plea&s;ure ground: but the country affords few objects to inrich either a fore-ground, or a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the road to Birmingham leads, at fir&s;t, through an open country; which after|wards
<PB N="51" REF="98">
becomes woody and clo&s;e; and more plea|&s;ant, as we approach the town.</P>
<P>The buildings, which you &s;ee &s;cattered about the land&s;cape, near Birmingham, are in great profu&s;ion, and generally of a reddi&s;h hue. For the country is populous; and the hou&s;es are built of a kind of brick, which has a peculiar red ca&s;t.&mdash;This tint predominating in a country, as it does here, is very unplea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Near Birmingham we went to &s;ee Bolton's hard-ware manufactory. It is a town under a &s;ingle roof; containing about &s;even hundred work people. But notwith&s;tanding it is a &s;cene of indu&s;try, utility, and ingenuity, it is difficult to keep the eye in humour among &s;o many fri|volous arts; and check it's looking with con|tempt on an hundred men employed in making a &s;nuff-box.</P>
<P>From Birmingham we left the great road, and pa&s;&s;ed through a plea&s;ant country to the Lea&s;owes and Hagley, which lie within a few miles of each other. In our way we had a &s;weet ride through an oak-wood, at Smithwick.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="99">Few places had rai&s;ed our expectations more than the Lea&s;owes. So great a lover of nature as Mr. Shen&s;tone appears to be in his writings, could not po&s;&s;ibly, one would imagine, deviate from her in any of the operations of his genius. I &s;hall give the reader a &s;light &s;ketch of the &s;cene; and then make a few general ob&s;erva|tions.</P>
<P>We entered the grounds, (which contain about an hundred acres) by a wicket, near the bottom of a lane, which leads to the hou&s;e. We &s;hould have been carried fir&s;t into the higher parts; where we might have had a view of the whole at once. We &s;hould then have &s;een that it is, what is properly called, an <HI>adorned farm;</HI> and &s;hould have taken that idea along with us. The fields lie about the hou&s;e; and a walk leads you round them.</P>
<P>We entered however below the hou&s;e; and were carried fir&s;t into a narrow, woody valley: from which emerging, we had a plea&s;ant open|ing into the country about Hale's-Owen.</P>
<P>From this view we dip into a woody bottom, where we find Melibeus's &s;eat, a &s;eque&s;tered
<PB N="53" REF="100">
&s;pot, proper for the noon-tide retreat of a &s;hepherd, and his flock.</P>
<P>From hence we penetrate another wood, and come &s;uddenly on a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of waterfalls (fourteen of them) &s;een through an irregular vi&s;ta of trees. The &s;cenery is whim&s;ical; but amu&s;ing.</P>
<P>Having thus traver&s;ed the lower grounds, the path leads into the higher; and we begin now to di&s;cover, that it is carrying us round the whole. Here we have di&s;tant views, bound|ed by the Wrekin in Shrop&s;hire.</P>
<P>From the&s;e grounds the path makes a &s;udden dip to a &s;eque&s;tered vale, where Mr. Shen&s;tone has dedicated an urn to the memory of a be|loved lady. From hence it ri&s;es again, in a trouble&s;ome zig-zag, into the <HI>Lover's walk;</HI> which terminates, (oddly enough,) in the <HI>temple of Pan.</HI> With more propriety it might have led to the <HI>temple of Hymen.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we de&s;cend again, through hang|ing fields, quite unadorned, to the mo&s;t fini&s;hed &s;cene of the whole. It is a grove, ornamented, at the upper end, by a ca&s;cade, from which the &s;tream plays in irregular meanders among the trees; and pa&s;&s;ing under a romantic bridge, forms it&s;elf into a &s;mall lake. This <HI>whim&s;ical</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="101">
&s;pot is dedicated, I think, with &s;ome impropriety, to Virgil's genius; and is one of tho&s;e ambigu|ous pa&s;&s;ages, which we are at a lo&s;s, whether to blame, or to commend. From hence we pa&s;s again into the lane, where we at fir&s;t en|tered,</P>
<P>Tho Mr. Shen&s;tone has, on the whole, &s;hewn great ta&s;te and elegance, and has diver&s;ified his views very much; and been particularly happy in (that mo&s;t agreeable mode of de&s;ign,) affix|ing &s;ome peculiar character to each &s;cene; yet in &s;ome things he has perhaps done <HI>too much;</HI> and in others <HI>not enough.</HI></P>
<P>In the u&s;e of water he has been too profu&s;e. He collects it only from a few &s;prings, which ouze from his &s;wampy grounds. It was a <HI>force therefore on nature,</HI> to attempt either a <HI>river,</HI> or a <HI>lake.</HI> A ca&s;cade, or a purling rill, &s;hould have &s;atisfied his ambition. Be&s;ides, like the water of all &s;wamps, the water of the Lea&s;owes wants brilliancy. Frothed by a fall, or quick de&s;cent, the impurities of it are le&s;s ob&s;erved: in gentle motion they are &s;triking; but in a lake they are offen&s;ive. It was ridiculous to &s;ee Naiads invited, by in&s;criptions, to bath their
<PB N="55" REF="102">
beauteous limbs in <HI>cry&s;tal</HI> pools, which &s;tood before the eye, impregnated with all the filth which generates from &s;tagnation.</P>
<P>He has done <HI>too much</HI> al&s;o in adorning his grounds &s;o profu&s;ely with urns, &s;tatues, and buildings; which are commonly the mo&s;t ex|pen&s;ive, and the lea&s;t beautiful parts of im|provement. In the <HI>adorned farm</HI> at lea&s;t they are <HI>improper</HI> decorations.</P>
<P>With his <HI>in&s;criptions,</HI> (in which many peo|ple &s;ay, he has done <HI>too much</HI> al&s;o) I own, I was plea&s;ed. When in&s;criptions are well-writ|ten, and properly adapted, as the&s;e generally are, they rai&s;e &s;ome leading thought; and im|pre&s;s the character of the &s;cene in &s;tronger ideas, than our own.</P>
<P>In other things Mr. Shen&s;tone has perhaps done <HI>too little.</HI></P>
<P>He might have thrown down more of his hedges: or, if that had been inconvenient, he might at lea&s;t have concealed his inclo&s;ures more in plantations. His path on the <HI>higher grounds,</HI> is, in general, too open; and his fore|grounds are often <HI>regular fields.</HI> This regula|rity might have been <HI>di&s;gui&s;ed.</HI> The <HI>di&s;tances</HI> too would have appeared to more advantage, if they had been &s;een &s;ometimes <HI>over</HI> a wood; and
<PB N="56" REF="103">
&s;ometimes <HI>through</HI> an opening in one; or occa|&s;ionally through inter&s;tices among the boles of the trees.</P>
<P>But Mr. Shen&s;tone's great deficiency lay in not draining, and cleaning his grounds. If he had made his verdure richer, tho at the expence of his buildings, he had &s;hewn a purer ta&s;te. But Shen&s;tone was poor; and with a little of that vanity, which often attends poverty, he cho&s;e rather to lay out his money on what made the mo&s;t &s;hew, than on what would have been mo&s;t becoming. From what he has done how|ever, it is ea&s;y to conceive what he could have done; if he had had a country &s;uited to his ideas; and a fortune &s;ufficient to adorn it.</P>
<P>I cannot leave the&s;e &s;cenes without remark|ing the peculiar beauty of his rocks, and ca&s;|cades.</P>
<P>Of all manufacturers, tho&s;e of rocks are commonly the mo&s;t bungling. How often are we carried, in the improvements even of peo|ple of ta&s;te, to &s;ee a piece of rock-&s;cenery, con|&s;i&s;ting perhaps of half a dozen large &s;tones. They neither give us any idea of what they are intended to repre&s;ent; nor are they probably &s;uited to the country, in which they are intro|duced. In our attempts to improve, if we do
<PB N="57" REF="104">
more than ju&s;t adorn what nature has done, by planting, and giving a little play to the ground, we err. To aim at changing the <HI>cha|racter</HI> of a country, is ab&s;urd. Where nature di&s;courages, it is vain to attempt. She
<Q><L>&mdash;&s;corns controul; &s;he will not bear</L>
<L>One beauty foreign to the &s;pot, or &s;oil,</L>
<L>She gives thee to adorn: 'tis thine alone</L>
<L>To mend, not change, her features&mdash;</L></Q>
Mr. Shen&s;tone however has &s;ucceeded the be&s;t in his rock &s;cenery, becau&s;e he has done the lea&s;t. He pretends only ju&s;t to fret his &s;treams, and break his ca&s;cades; and it would be invi|dious not to own, that his ca&s;cades, rocks, and &s;treams are all as exact copies of nature, as we any where find.</P>
<P>On leaving Mr. Shen&s;tone's, a very few miles brought us to Hagley. The evening was fine; and we &s;aw it in all it's glory. Yet we left it di&s;appointed. The plan of Hagley, (if there be any) is &s;o confu&s;ed, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe it. There is no coherency of parts. One &s;cene is tacked to another; and any one might be removed, without the lea&s;t injury to the re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="105">A work of art, (be it what it may, hou&s;e, picture, book, or garden,) however beautiful in it's <HI>underparts,</HI> lo&s;es half it's value, if the <HI>general &s;cope</HI> of it be not obvious to conception. Even the wild &s;cene of nature, however plea&s;|ing in it&s;elf, is &s;till more plea&s;ing, if the eye is able to combine it into a whole.</P>
<P>But <HI>ob&s;curity</HI> in the <HI>general plan,</HI> is not the only objection we made to Hagley: it is <HI>formal</HI> in many of it's <HI>parts.</HI> The view at the en|trance is particularly unplea&s;ing; con&s;i&s;ting of a lawn ri&s;ing <HI>from</HI> the hou&s;e; clo&s;ed at the upper end, with a regular &s;emicircle of wood; and adorned in the middle by an obeli&s;k.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e &s;cenes al&s;o are <HI>minute</HI> and <HI>trifling.</HI> The per&s;pective view at the Palla|dian bridge, and the rever&s;e from the rotunda, are below critici&s;m. Such al&s;o is the &s;tream conveyed, in a channel, little wider than a drill, through the extent of a noble lawn. Some pains too have been taken to make it gurgle, as it runs. Mr. Shen&s;tone wrought in miniature; and tho he rarely trifles, diminu|tive beauties were in part accommodated to his &s;cheme. But lord Lyttelton wrought on a larger &s;cale: his ideas &s;hould have inlarged with it. His pencil &s;hould have &s;corned the
<PB N="59" REF="106">
little touches of trifling exactne&s;s: and he &s;hould have con&s;idered that his piece both con&s;i&s;ted of nobler objects, and was to be &s;een at a greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Added to the&s;e defects, there is a want al&s;o of <HI>variety.</HI> The &s;ides of the hills are all planted; and the vallies are all lawns. Through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e rece&s;&s;es you are carried. From one lawn you enter another, with little variation of the idea. The &s;ame thought is repeated over and over: <Q><L>&mdash;Cingentibus ultima &s;ylvis,</L>
<L>Purus ab aboribus, &s;pectabilis undique campus.</L></Q></P>
<P>It would however be invidious not to con|fe&s;s, that &s;ome of the&s;e lawns, con&s;idered as independent parts, are very beautiful.</P>
<P><HI>Thomp&s;on</HI>'s &s;eat exhibits a noble di&s;play of &s;cenery. You look acro&s;s a &s;pacious valley of a mile in extent; the whole a pa&s;ture, wind|ing at both ends from the eye. The oppo&s;ite bank, which conducts the &s;weep, is hung with wood. At one end of the valley is a di&s;tant view into the country; terminated by the Malvern hills. At the other, the woody bank is adorned by a modern ruin, which &s;tands well, but is an object too minute for
<PB N="60" REF="107">
the &s;cene. One large round tower, with an underpart, or two, would have had a better effect at a di&s;tance, than &s;uch a quantity of wall, and other trifling parts, which have been con|trived to an&s;wer &s;ome purpo&s;e of utility: whereas the only character &s;uch a ruin has to &s;upport, is that of being the <HI>di&s;tant ornament of a &s;cene;</HI> with which it's utility, if it have any, &s;hould coincide. If it doth not an&s;wer this end, the cow-hou&s;e, or the keeper's lodge, or whatever it is, &s;hould occupy &s;ome le&s;s di&s;tin|gui&s;hed &s;tation. <HI>Here,</HI> it only &s;hews us, that there &s;hould have been &s;omething, which we do not find.</P>
<P>On the whole, tho there are certainly many very beautiful views in the&s;e exten&s;ive gardens, yet we may ea&s;ily conceive, the &s;ame variety of ground, the &s;ame profu&s;ion of wood, and the &s;ame advantages of water (tho in this point the deficiency is greate&s;t) might have been &s;o combined as to produce a much nobler whole.</P>
<P>It may be added however, that only the common round of the garden has been here criticized. The rides in the park are very exten&s;ive; and, as they are le&s;s dre&s;&s;ed, they may perhaps be more beautiful. The temple
<PB N="61" REF="108">
of The&s;eus &s;tands very happily; is a hand&s;ome object; and has as grand an effect, as any thing of the kind can have.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e is a good modern pile; but wants a dignity of &s;ituation, &s;uitable to the capital of &s;uch exten&s;ive dominions.</P>

<P>FROM lord Lyttelton's, we propo&s;ed to vi&s;it Mr. An&s;on's, near Wol&s;ley-bridge. Our rout led through Stourbridge, Wolver|hampton, and Penkridge. The country is rich and woody; but affords little that is picture&s;que. In many parts it is much disfigured by a new canal, which cuts it in pieces.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t beautiful objects in nature is a noble river, winding through a country; and di&s;covering it's mazy cour&s;e, &s;ometimes half-concealed by it's woody banks; and &s;ometimes di&s;playing it's ample folds through the open vale.</P>
<P>It's oppo&s;ite, in every re&s;pect, is one of the&s;e <HI>cuts,</HI> as they are called. It's lineal, and angu|lar cour&s;e&mdash;it's relinqui&s;hing the declivities of the country; and pa&s;&s;ing over hill, and dale; &s;ometimes banked up on one &s;ide, and &s;ome|times on both&mdash;it's &s;harp, parrallel edges, naked,
<PB N="64" REF="112">
and unadorned&mdash;all contribute to place it in the &s;tronge&s;t contra&s;t with the river. An object may be di&s;gu&s;ting in it&s;elf; but it is &s;till more &s;o, when it reminds you, by &s;ome di&s;tant re|&s;emblance, of &s;omething beautiful.</P>
<P>At Penkridge we left the great road, and de|viated to the right, over a wild heath, to Shuck|borough, the &s;eat of Mr. An&s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. An&s;on's improvements are nobly con|ceived, making their object the whole face of a country. It is a pity &s;o generous a de&s;ign had not been directed by a better ta&s;te. His build|ings are all on Grecian, and Roman models; and &s;ome of them very beautiful. But they want accompaniments. There is &s;omething rather ab&s;urd in adorning a plain field with a triumphal arch; or with the lanthern of De|mo&s;thenes, re&s;tored to all it's &s;plendor. A po|li&s;hed jewel, &s;et in lead is ridiculous. But above all, the temple of the winds, &s;eated in a pool, in&s;tead of being placed on a hill, is ill-&s;tationed. As it is &s;ome time however, &s;ince we &s;aw the &s;cenes of Shuckborough, they may now be greatly altered, and improved. The

temple of the winds, I fear, mu&s;t ever &s;tand as it does.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e contains little worth notice. It is furni&s;hed in a frippery &s;ort of Chine&s;e manner. There are few pictures of value. The hall is adorned with the naval atchievements of lord An&s;on by Scot; in which the genius of the painter has been regulated by the articles of war. The <HI>line of battle</HI> is a mi&s;erable arrange|ment on canvas; and it is an act of inhumanity in an admiral to injoin it. If the line of battle mu&s;t be introduced, it &s;hould be formed at a di&s;tance; and the &s;tre&s;s laid on &s;ome of the &s;hips, at one end of the line, brought into action, near the eye.</P>
<P>The drawing-room is hung with large ruins, in <HI>di&s;temper,</HI> by Dahl. They are touched with &s;pirit; but the compo&s;ition wants &s;implicity. There is a rawne&s;s al&s;o, and want of force in <HI>di&s;temper;</HI> tho it certainly gives a more plea&s;ing &s;urface for the eye to re&s;t on, than oil-painting, which cannot be dive&s;ted of the delu&s;ive lights of varni&s;h.</P>
<P>The windows of the room, in which the&s;e pictures hang, look towards a pile of artificial
<PB N="66" REF="114">
ruins in the park. But Mr. An&s;on has been le&s;s happy in fabricating fictitious ruins; than in re&s;toring &s;uch as are real.</P>
<P>If a ruin be intended to take a &s;tation merely in &s;ome di&s;tant, inacce&s;&s;ible place; one or two points of view are all that need be provided for. The con&s;truction therefore of &s;uch a ruin is a matter of le&s;s nicety. It is a ruin in a picture.</P>
<P>But if it be pre&s;ented on a &s;pot, as this is, where the &s;pectator may walk round it, and &s;urvey it on every &s;ide&mdash;perhaps enter it&mdash;the con&s;truction of it becomes then a matter of great difficulty.</P>
<P>This difficulty ari&s;es fir&s;t from the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;tructing it on as regular, and uniform a plan, as if it had been a real edifice. Not only the &s;ituation, and general form of the ca&s;tle, or the abbey, &s;hould be ob&s;erved; but the &s;everal parts &s;hould at lea&s;t be &s;o traced out, that an eye, &s;killed in &s;uch edifices, may ea&s;ily inve&s;ti|gate the parts, which are lo&s;t, from the parts, which remain. There &s;hould always be the <HI>disjecta membra.</HI> So that in con&s;tructing a ruin, no part &s;hould be pre&s;ented, which the eye does not ea&s;ily conceive mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been there, if the whole had been compleat.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="115">Nor is the expence, which attends the con|&s;truction of &s;uch a ruin, a trifling difficulty. The picture&s;que ruin mu&s;t have no vulgarity of &s;hape: it mu&s;t convey the idea of grandeur: And no ruins, that I know, except tho&s;e of a ca&s;tle, or an abbey, are &s;uited to this purpo&s;e; and both the&s;e are works of great expence.</P>
<P>But, you &s;ay, <HI>a part</HI> only need be introduced. It is true. But if your &s;cene be ample, (and you would introduce it in no other,) the part, you introduce, mu&s;t be ample al&s;o. A paltry ruin is of no value. A grand one is a work of magnificence. A garden-temple, or a Palla|dian bridge, may ea&s;ily be effected: but &s;uch a portion of ruin, as will give <HI>any idea</HI> of a ca&s;tle, or an abbey, that is worth di&s;playing, requires an expence equal to that of the man&s;ion you in|habit.</P>
<P>There is great art, and difficulty al&s;o in <HI>exe|cuting</HI> a building of this kind. It is not every man, who can build a hou&s;e, that can execute a ruin. To give the &s;tone it's mouldering ap|pearance &mdash;to make the widening chink run naturally through all the joints&mdash;to mutilate the ornaments&mdash;to peel the facing from the in|ternal &s;tructure&mdash;to &s;hew how corre&s;pondent parts have once united; tho now the cha&s;m
<PB N="68" REF="116">
runs wide between them&mdash;and to &s;catter heaps of ruin around with negligence and ea&s;e; are great efforts of art; much too delicate for the hand of a common workman; and what we very rarely &s;ee performed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, after all, that art can be&s;tow, you mu&s;t put your ruin at la&s;t into the hands of na|ture to adorn, and perfect it. If the mo&s;&s;es, and lychens grow unkindly on your walls&mdash;if the &s;treaming weather-&s;tains have produced no variety of tints&mdash;if the ivy refu&s;es to mantle over your buttre&s;s; or to creep among the ornaments of your Gothic window&mdash;if the a&s;h, cannot be brought to hang from the cleft; or long, &s;piry gra&s;s to wave over the &s;hattered battlement&mdash; your ruin will be &s;till incomplete&mdash;you may as well write over the gate, Built in the year 1772. Deception there can be none. The characters of age are wanting. It is time alone, which meliorates the ruin; which gives it perfect beauty; and brings it, if I may &s;o &s;peak, to a &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>On laying all the&s;e difficulties together, we &s;ee how arduous a matter it is to con&s;truct &s;uch a ruin, as is to be &s;een <HI>on the &s;pot.</HI> When it is well done, we allow, that nothing can be more beautiful: but we &s;ee every where &s;o many ab&s;urd attempts of this kind, that when

we walk through a piece of improved ground; and hear of being carried next to <HI>&s;ee the ruins,</HI> if the ma&s;ter of the &s;cene be with us, we dread the incounter.</P>
<P>From Mr. An&s;on's we continued our rout to Stone by Wol&s;ley-bridge, through the &s;ame kind of rich, plea&s;ant country: and from thence, in our way to Newca&s;tle, we propo&s;ed to take a view of lord Gower's. But a &s;hower of rain prevented us. As far however, as we could judge from a ha&s;ty glance, the grounds about Trentham are laid out with great &s;implicity and elegance. The &s;ituation of the hou&s;e is low. Before it lies an exten&s;ive lawn, half-incircled with ri&s;ing grounds; along which the planta|tions &s;weep in one great, varied line.</P>
<P>From Newca&s;tle we took our rout to Man|che&s;ter. In our road we wi&s;hed for time to have vi&s;ited the potteries of Mr. Wedgwood; where the elegant arts of old Etruria are revived. It would have been plea&s;ing to &s;ee all the&s;e works in their progre&s;s to perfection; but it was of le&s;s moment; as the forms of all his Tu&s;can va&s;es were familiar to us.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="119">One great principle in the con&s;truction of a Tu&s;can va&s;e, relates to the mode of &s;etting on the handle. It always ri&s;es from the ve&s;&s;el; with which it is united; and of which it makes a part. The &s;trength and beauty of the ve&s;&s;el depends &s;o much on this principle; that one would wonder, how it &s;hould ever be overlook|ed; and indeed I have &s;ometimes ob&s;erved it in the con&s;truction of &s;ome of our coar&s;er jars; for the &s;ake probably of the &s;trength, which it adds to the handle. But in general, it is totally neglected; and the handles of our modern ve&s;&s;els, whether of clay, or of metal, tho &s;ome of them very co&s;tly, in&s;tead of <HI>making a part</HI> of the ve&s;&s;els them&s;elves, are awkwardly <HI>fixed</HI> to them.</P>
<P>At Talk-on-the-hill the views are exten&s;ive, and beautiful on both &s;ides: the ground is well di&s;po&s;ed; and the land&s;cape woody.</P>
<P>As we de&s;cended, the knolls, and little de|pre&s;&s;ions of the country, which &s;een from the higher grounds, were flat, and undi&s;tingui&s;hed,
<PB N="71" REF="120">
became now hills and vallies, adding new modes of variety.</P>
<P>We &s;oon however left all this land&s;cape be|hind, and entered an unplea&s;ant country. But after we had pa&s;&s;ed Holm's-chapel, and a dreary common beyond it; a beautiful &s;cene opened, in which we continued many miles. The road often led through groves of oak; and often through lanes imbowered with lofty trees; which were beautiful in their natural &s;implicity beyond the improvement of art.</P>
<P>The duke of Bridgewater's works near Man|che&s;ter are very great. We admire equally the grandeur of the conception, and the &s;kill of the execution. In a painter's eye indeed, we have ju&s;t &s;een, that works of this kind are of little value.</P>
<P>From Wor&s;ley-mills we took a barge to Manche&s;ter; but found little amu&s;ement in our voyage, except that of exchanging a rough, jolting motion over rugged pavements; with that of gliding gently along the &s;urface of a &s;mooth canal.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="121">We were &s;truck with one appearance indeed of a &s;ingular kind; that of Chap-mo&s;s; which &s;tretching on the right along the &s;pace of thirty miles, held the eye in &s;u&s;pence, through the &s;hades of twilight, whether it were land, or water. It's colour &s;poke it one; it's &s;urface, the other.</P>
<P>From Manche&s;ter, around which the country is not unplea&s;ant, we pur&s;ued our rout to Pre&s;ton, and Lanca&s;ter. Great part of the road to Bol|ton is beautiful. The views about Ringley, where a con&s;iderable &s;tream forces it's way, between &s;teep, woody banks, are very pictu|re&s;que. They were the more plea&s;ing, as we came upon them by accident; having been obliged to leave the great road, which &s;ome late floods had made impa&s;&s;able by carrying away a bridge.</P>
<P>From Bolton we a&s;cended a heighth of four miles, over a &s;ort of cultivated mountain. The country, that lay &s;tretched beneath, on the left, was &s;oftened, without any intervening grounds, into a blue di&s;tance. When we de&s;cended the
<PB N="73" REF="122">
heights, and entered it, it wore a plea&s;ing, va|riegated form. It was woody too, and adorned with little rills, every where working along the vallies.</P>
<P>Between Charly and Pre&s;ton there is like|wi&s;e much high ground, which let us down, like the heights of Bolton, into a plea&s;ant &s;cene, rich, flat, and woody.</P>
<P>As we approached Pre&s;ton, the retro&s;pect of Walton-church, over the windings of the Rib|ble, is very beautiful.</P>
<P>From Pre&s;ton to Gar&s;tang the country is un|plea&s;ant. The ground is varied; but it is de|ficient in wood, and has not dignity to &s;upport it&s;elf without it.</P>
<P>Here fir&s;t the mountains begin to ri&s;e; and give us a pro&s;pect of the country before us. But they yet a&s;&s;ume no formidable features. Tinged with light azure, they only &s;kirted the
<PB N="74" REF="123">
horizon; and at a great di&s;tance accompanied us, in a lengthened chain on the left.</P>
<P>As we approach Gar&s;tang, the ca&s;tle, tho ruined into a mere block, and without beauty, becomes an object, where there is no other.</P>
<P>From Gar&s;tang to Lanca&s;ter there is little change in the land&s;cape. It &s;till continues bleak and unplea&s;ant. But as we now approach|ed the mountains, every object began to pro|claim the rugged &s;cenes, into which we were entering. The country we now traver&s;ed, may be called a kind of connecting thread: it&s;elf of an uncharacterized &s;pecies, &s;triking us with no determined features. It has neither the gran|deur of the mountain &s;cene; nor the chearful|ne&s;s of the &s;ylvan: what wood there is, is poor, and &s;hrivelled. For we now &s;kirted the bay of Cartmel, and the &s;ea-air having caught the trees, had impoveri&s;hed their foliage, &s;tinted their growth, and de&s;troyed their very form, with unu&s;ual rigour.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="124">At a mile's di&s;tance Lanca&s;ter-ca&s;tle ri&s;es to view. It's lofty &s;ituation, it's ma&s;&s;y towers, and exten&s;ive buildings (for it is connected with the church) give an air of grandeur to it's ap|pearance: but as the parts are neither well &s;haped, nor well combined, it is but an indif|ferent object from any point. On the &s;pot, the mo&s;t beautiful part is a noble front; which, with it's other grand appendages, afford &s;uffi|cient matter for the curio&s;ity of an antiquarian.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the town the river Lune, which is a noble piece of water, when the tide is full, &s;ufficiently adorns the land&s;cape.</P>
<P>But here the Lune is a bu&s;y, noi&s;y &s;cene, banked with quays; covered with &s;hipping; and re&s;ounding with nautic clamour. Far otherwi&s;e is it's pa&s;&s;age, a few miles above, through the vale of Lond&s;dale; where quietly, and unob&s;erved, it winds around projecting rocks&mdash;forms circling boundaries to meadows, pa&s;tured with cattle&mdash;or pa&s;&s;es through groves and thickets, which, in fabulous times, might have been the haunt of wood-gods. In one part, taking a &s;udden turn, it circles a little, delicious &s;pot, forming it into a penin&s;ula,
<PB N="76" REF="125">
called vulgarly, <HI>the wheel of Lune.</HI> Here once dwelt an ancient hermit; where his eyes &s;aw nothing, nor wi&s;hed to &s;ee any thing, except the &s;weet vale, in which he lived.</P>
<P>From the ca&s;tle-hill, or rather from the church-yard, we had a very exten&s;ive view, compo&s;ed of the grande&s;t objects. Along the meadows below, the river Lune, now an e&s;tu|ary, and adorned with a variety of coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;els, (le&s;&s;ening to the eye, through it's &s;eve|ral reaches,) ha&s;tens to the &s;ea. In a mile or two, it enters the bay of Cartmel; which filled with the tide, pre&s;ents a noble extent of water, ten or twelve miles acro&s;s, bounded by the mountains of Furne&s;s; which extend through va&s;t &s;pace; and then circling the head of the bay, form many a &s;hooting promontory, and many a winding &s;hore.</P>
<P>This exten&s;ion of wild country we looked at with regret, knowing the many noble &s;cenes it contained, which we had not time to vi&s;it. We were obliged to re&s;t &s;atisfied with forming imaginary pictures among the blue mi&s;ts of the mountains. Our guide, an unlettered &s;wain, pointed out, in the broad dialect of his country, the &s;everal &s;pots&mdash;where the ruins of Furne&s;s-abbey lay &s;eque&s;tered in a lowly vale&mdash;where, far
<PB N="77" REF="126">
to the we&s;t, Peel-ca&s;tle, running boldly out into the water, commanded the entrance of the bay&mdash;where, deep beneath tho&s;e purpli&s;h moun|tains, the lake of Coni&s;ton occupied a valley &s;ix miles in length&mdash;where Holker-hall; and Bard|&s;ey; and Coni&s;hed, founded on the &s;ite of an ancient priory; and many other places of re|nowned &s;ituation, were all &s;urrounded with &s;cenes of grandeur; and each, as far as we could judge from our intelligence, with &s;cenes peculiar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>From Lanca&s;ter, in our rout to Kendal, the country, every &s;tep, becomes more character|i&s;tic. High, &s;helving grounds ari&s;e on the right; and on the left, at every opening, we have different views of the bay of Cartmel, and of the mountains of Furne&s;s. The fore-ground is every where adorned with large, detached &s;tones; which indicate the rocks we approach.</P>
<P>A little beyond Burton we left the great road&punc; and took a circuit of two or three miles to &s;ee the country about Milthorp, and Levens.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="127">Cartmel-bay branches here into a creek; on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of which lies Milthorp; a little coa&s;ting-port-town; and near it Dalham-tower, in a plea&s;ant park, defended by a hill from the &s;ea-air. All around we have beautiful views, con&s;i&s;ting of woody fore-grounds, and of di&s;|tances compo&s;ed of different parts of this little e&s;tuary, and it's appendant mountains.</P>
<P>As we proceeded higher up the creek, the views, increa&s;ed in beauty. About Levens, a &s;eat of the earl of Suffolk, there is a happy com|bination of every thing that is <HI>lovely</HI> and <HI>great</HI> in land&s;cape. It &s;tands at the head of the creek, upon the Kenet, a wild romantic &s;tream, which ru&s;hes into the tide, a little below. The hou&s;e, incompa&s;&s;ed with hilly grounds, is well &s;creened from the pernicious effects of the &s;ea-air. But we did not ride up to it. The woods with which it abounds, we were told, grow luxuriantly; and the views at hand are as plea&s;ing, as tho&s;e at a di&s;tance, are great; which con&s;i&s;t of a lengthened beach of &s;and along the creek; and of Whitbarrow-cragg, a rough, and very pictu|re&s;que promontory; with other high lands, &s;hooting into the bay.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="128">Among the beautiful objects of di&s;tance, we con&s;ider a winding &s;and-beach, e&s;pecially when &s;een from a woody fore-ground. It's hue, amid the verdure of foliage, is a plea&s;ant, cha&s;|ti&s;ing tint. When the tide flows, the &s;ands change their appearance, and take the &s;till more plea&s;ing form of a noble lake.</P>
<P>Levens is at pre&s;ent in a neglected &s;tate: but is certainly capable of being made equal to al|mo&s;t any &s;cene in England.</P>
<P>From hence we proceeded to Kendal; &s;ituated in a wild, unplea&s;ant country, which contains no &s;triking objects; and cannot be formed into any of tho&s;e plea&s;ing combinations, which con|&s;titute a picture. Here and there a view may be found; though but &s;eldom. The ca&s;tle, which is a mere ruin, is in &s;ome &s;ituations, e&s;pecially near the bridge, a good object.</P>
<P>Between Kendal and Amble&s;ide, the wood increa&s;es in grandeur; but the &s;cenery is &s;till undetermined. The whole is a &s;ort of confu&s;ed greatne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="129">As we de&s;cend to the left, we approach Windermere, where a different &s;pecies of coun|try &s;ucceeds. The wild mountains, which were &s;o ill-ma&s;&s;ed, and of a kind &s;o unaccom|modating to land&s;cape, are left behind; and the road dips into a lovely &s;ylvan &s;cene, leading interchangeably through clo&s;e groves, under wooded hills, and along the banks of the lake.</P>

<P>WE had now arrived on the confines of tho&s;e romantic &s;cenes, which were the principal inducement to this tour. Here therefore we propo&s;ed to make &s;ome pau&s;e; and pay a little more attention to the country, than a ha&s;ty pa&s;&s;age through it, would allow.</P>
<P>But to render a de&s;cription of the&s;e &s;cenes more intelligible; and to &s;hew more di&s;tinctly the &s;ources of that kind of beauty, with which they abound; it may be proper, before we examine the &s;cenes them&s;elves, to take a &s;ort of analytical view of the materials, which com|po&s;e them&mdash;<HI>mountains&mdash;lakes&mdash;broken grounds &mdash;wood&mdash;rocks&mdash;ca&s;cades&mdash;vallies</HI>&mdash;and <HI>rivers.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to <HI>mountains,</HI> it may be fir&s;t premi&s;ed, that, in a picture&s;que view, we con|&s;ider them only as <HI>di&s;tant</HI> objects; their enor|mous
<PB N="82" REF="131">
&s;ize di&s;qualifying them for objects at hand. In the removed part of a picture there|fore, the mountain properly appears; where it's immen&s;ity, reduced by di&s;tance, can be taken in by the eye; and it's mon&s;trous fea|tures, lo&s;ing their deformity, a&s;&s;ume a &s;oftne&s;s which naturally belongs not to them.</P>
<P>I would not however be under&s;tood to mean, that a mountain is proper only to clo&s;e an <HI>ex|tended</HI> view. It may take it's &s;tation in a &s;econd, or third di&s;tance with equal propriety. And even on a fore-ground, a rugged corner of it's ba&s;e may be introduced; tho it's upper regions a&s;pire far beyond the limits of any picture.</P>
<P>Having thus premi&s;ed the <HI>&s;tation,</HI> which a mountain properly occupies in land&s;cape, we &s;hall now examine the <HI>mountain</HI> it&s;elf; in which, four things particularly &s;trike us&mdash;it's <HI>line</HI>&mdash; the <HI>objects,</HI> which adorn it's &s;urface&mdash;it's <HI>tints</HI> &mdash;and it's <HI>light</HI> and <HI>&s;hade.</HI></P>
<P>The beauty of a di&s;tant mountain in a great mea&s;ure, depends on the line it traces along
<PB REF="132">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="83" REF="133">
the &s;ky; which is generally of a lighter hue. The pyramidal &s;hape, and ea&s;y flow of an irregular line, will be found in the mountain, as in other delineations, the true&s;t &s;ource of beauty.</P>
<P>Mountains therefore ri&s;ing in regular, ma|thematical lines, or in whim&s;ical, grote&s;que &s;hapes, are di&s;plea&s;ing. Thus <HI>Burn&s;wark,</HI> a mountain on the &s;outhern border of Scotland; <HI>Thorp-Cloud,</HI> near Dovedale in Derby&s;hire, e&s;pecially when &s;een from the garden at Ilam; and a mountain in Cumberland, which from it's peculiar appearance in &s;ome &s;ituations, takes the name of <HI>Saddle-back,</HI> all form di&s;agreeable lines. And thus many of the pointed &s;ummits of the <HI>Alps</HI> are objects rather of &s;ingularity, than of beauty. Such forms al&s;o as &s;ugge&s;t the idea of lumpi&s;h <HI>heavine&s;s</HI> are di&s;gu&s;ting&mdash; round, &s;welling forms, without any break to di&s;incumber them of their weight.</P>
<P>Indeed a continuity of line without a break, whether it be <HI>concave, &s;traight,</HI> or <HI>convex,</HI> will always di&s;plea&s;e, becau&s;e it wants variety; unle&s;s indeed it be well contra&s;ted with other forms. The effect al&s;o of a broken line is bad, if the breaks are regular.</P>

His hair and beard become trees, and other vegetable &s;ub&s;tance; his bones, rocks; and his head, and &s;houlders, &s;ummits, and promon|tories. &mdash;But to de&s;cribe minutely the <HI>parts</HI> of a <HI>di&s;tant</HI> object (for we are con&s;idering a mountain in this light) would be to invert the rules of per&s;pective, by making that <HI>di&s;tinct,</HI> which &s;hould be <HI>ob&s;cure.</HI> I &s;hall con&s;ider there|fore all that variety, which covers the &s;urface of di&s;tant mountains, as blended together in one ma&s;s; and made the &s;tratum of tho&s;e tints, which we often find playing upon them.</P>
<P>The&s;e tints, which are the mo&s;t beautiful ornaments of the mountain, are of all colours; but the mo&s;t prevalent are yellow, and purple. We can hardly con&s;ider <HI>blue</HI> as a mountain-tint. It is the mere colour of the intervening

air&mdash;the hue, which naturally inve&s;ts all di&s;tant objects, as well as mountains. The late Dr. Brown, author of the E&s;timate, in a de&s;crip|tion, which he printed, of the lake of Ke&s;wick, very ju&s;tly calls the&s;e tints <HI>the yellow &s;treams of light, the purple hues, and mi&s;ty azure of the mountains.</HI> They are rarely permanent; but &s;eem to be a &s;ort of floating, &s;ilky colours&mdash; always in motion&mdash;always in harmony&mdash;and playing with a thou&s;and changeable varieties into each other. They are literally <HI>colours dipped in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>The variety of the&s;e tints depends on many circum&s;tances&mdash;the &s;ea&s;on of the year&mdash;the hour of the day&mdash;a dry, or a moi&s;t atmo&s;phere. The <HI>lines</HI> and <HI>&s;hapes</HI> of mountains (features &s;trongly marked) are ea&s;ily caught and retained: but the&s;e meteor-forms, this rich fluctuation of airy hues, offer &s;uch a profu&s;ion of variegated &s;plendor, that they are continually illuding the eye with breaking into each other; and are lo&s;t, as it endeavours to retain them. This airy colouring, tho in &s;un&s;hine it appears mo&s;t brilliant; yet in &s;ome degree it is <HI>generally</HI> found in tho&s;e mountains, where it prevails.</P>
<P>In the late voyages round the world, publi&s;h|ed by Dr. Hawk&s;worth, we have an account
<PB N="87" REF="139">
of the great beauty of the colouring ob&s;erved on the peak of Teneriffe. <Q>It's appearance at &s;un-&s;et, &s;ays the author, was very &s;triking. When the &s;un was below the horizon, and the re&s;t of the i&s;land appeared of a deep black; the mountain &s;till reflected his rays, and glowed with a warmth of colouring, which no painting can expre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The rays of the &s;un, which are the cau&s;e of all colour, no doubt, produce the&s;e tints to the eye; yet we mu&s;t believe there is &s;omething peculiar in the &s;urfaces of &s;ome mountains, which di&s;po&s;e them to reflect the rays with &s;uch variety of tints. On many mountains the&s;e appearances are not ob&s;ervable; and where the &s;urface is uniform, the tint will be &s;o likewi&s;e. <Q>The effect in que&s;tion, &s;ays Mr. Lock, re|marking on this pa&s;&s;age, is very familiar to me. I &s;aw it almo&s;t every evening in Savoy, when the &s;un &s;hone. It is only on the tops of the highe&s;t mountains, that the effect is perfect. Mount Blanc being covered with the pure&s;t &s;now, and having no tint of it's own, was often of the brighte&s;t ro&s;e-colour.</Q></P>

<P>Homer, who had a genius as picture&s;que as Virgil, (tho he &s;eems to have known little of <HI>the art of painting</HI>) was &s;truck with two things in his views of mountains&mdash;with tho&s;e cavi|ties and projections, which abound upon their &s;urfaces&mdash;and with what he calls their <HI>&s;ha|dowing forms.</HI> Of the former, he takes notice, when he &s;peaks of a &s;ingle mountain; of the latter, when he &s;peaks of mountains in combi|nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under the fir&s;t idea he &s;peaks of Mount Olympus, which he calls <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>many vallied.</HI> Il. 8. 411.</NOTE>.

<P>The cavities which he ob&s;erved, and which are &s;een only from their being the deep rece&s;&s;es of &s;hade, together with the rocks, and little projections, which are vi&s;ible only from catch|ing a &s;tronger ray of light, contribute to pro|duce the <HI>partial</HI> effect&mdash;that richne&s;s, and va|riety on the &s;ides of di&s;tant mountains, which would otherwi&s;e be a di&s;play of flat, fatiguing &s;urface. The objects them&s;elves are formle&s;s, and indi&s;tinct; yet, by pre&s;enting different &s;ur|faces for the light to re&s;t on, the rich and va|riegated effect, here mentioned, is produced.</P>

<P>HAVING thus con&s;idered the chief cir|cum&s;tances, which occur in <HI>di&s;tant moun|tains,</HI> let us now inlarge our view, and take in the <HI>lake,</HI> which makes the next con&s;iderable part of this romantic country.</P>
<P>The <HI>fen,</HI> the <HI>pool,</HI> and the <HI>lake</HI> would pre|&s;ent very different ideas, tho magnitude were out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The <HI>fen</HI> is a pla&s;hy inundation, formed on a flat&mdash;without depth&mdash;without lineal boundary&mdash; of ambiguous texture&mdash;half water&mdash;and half land&mdash;a &s;ort of vegetable fluid.</P>
<P>The <HI>pool</HI> is a collection of the &s;oakings of &s;ome common; or the re&s;ervoir of the neigh|bouring ditches, which depo&s;it in it's ouzy bed
<PB N="94" REF="145">
the &s;oil of the country, clay, or mud; and give a corre&s;pondent tinge to the water.</P>
<P>In &s;ome things the <HI>fen</HI> and the <HI>pool</HI> agree. They both take every thing in, and let nothing out. Each of them is in &s;ummer a &s;ink of pu|trefaction; and the receptacle of all tho&s;e un|clean, mis&s;hapen forms in animal life, which breed and batten in the impurities of &s;tagnation;
<Q><L>Where putrefaction into life ferments,</L>
<L>And breathes de&s;tructive myriads.</L></Q></P>
<P>Very different is the origin of the <HI>lake.</HI> It's magnificent, and marble bed, formed in the caverns, and deep rece&s;&s;es of rocky mountains, received originally the pure pellucid waters of &s;ome ru&s;hing torrent, as it came fir&s;t from the hand of nature&mdash;arre&s;ted it's cour&s;e, till the &s;pacious, and &s;plendid ba&s;on was filled brim|full; and then di&s;charged the &s;tream, un&s;ullied, and undimini&s;hed, through &s;ome winding vale, to form other lakes, or increa&s;e the dignity of &s;ome imperial river. Here no impurities find entrance, either of animal, or of vegetable life:
<Q><L>&mdash;Non illic canna palu&s;tris,</L>
<L>Nec &s;teriles ulvae, naec acut&acirc; cu&s;pide junci.</L></Q></P>

<P><PB N="95" REF="147">From the bri&s;k circulation of fluid through the&s;e animated bodies of water, a great ma&s;ter of nature has nobly &s;tyled them, <HI>living lakes:</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;Speluncae,</L>

and indeed nothing, which is not really alive, de&s;erves the appellation better. For be&s;ides the vital &s;tream, which principally feeds them, they receive a thou&s;and little gurgling rills, which trickling through a thou&s;and veins, give life, and &s;pirit to every part.</P>
<P>The principal incidents ob&s;ervable in <HI>lakes,</HI> are, their <HI>line of boundary</HI>&mdash;their <HI>i&s;lands</HI>&mdash;and the different appearances of the <HI>&s;urface</HI> of the water.</P>
<P>The <HI>line of boundary</HI> is very various. Some|times it is boldly broken by a projecting pro|montory&mdash;&s;ometimes indebted by a creek&mdash; &s;ometimes it undulates along an irregular &s;hore &mdash;and &s;ometimes &s;wells into a winding bay. In each of the&s;e circum&s;tances it is &s;u&s;ceptible of beauty; in all, it certainly de&s;erves attention: for as it is a line of &s;eparation between land and water, it is of cour&s;e &s;o con&s;picuous a boundary, that the lea&s;t har&s;hne&s;s in it is di&s;cernible. I
<PB N="96" REF="148">
have known many a good land&s;cape injured by a bad water boundary.</P>
<P>This line, it may be further ob&s;erved, varies under different circum&s;tances. When the eye is placed <HI>upon</HI> the lake, the line of boundary is a <HI>circular thread,</HI> with little undulation; unle&s;s when &s;ome promontory of more than u&s;ual magnitude &s;hoots into the water. All &s;maller irregularities are lo&s;t. The particular beauty of it under this circum&s;tance, con&s;i&s;ts in the oppo&s;ition between &s;uch a <HI>thread,</HI> and the irre|gular line formed by the &s;ummits of the moun|tains.</P>
<P>But when the eye is placed on the higher grounds, <HI>above</HI> the level of the lake, the line of boundary takes a new form; and what ap|peared to the <HI>levelled</HI> eye a circular thread, be|comes <HI>now</HI> an undulating line, projecting, and retiring more or le&s;s, according to the degree of the eye's elevation. The circular thread was indebted for it's principal beauty to contra&s;t: but this, like all other elegant lines, has the additional beauty of variety.</P>
<P>And yet, in <HI>&s;ome</HI> ca&s;es the <HI>levelled</HI> eye has the advantage of the <HI>elevated</HI> one. The line, which forms an acute angle from the <HI>higher</HI> &s;ituation,
<PB N="97" REF="149">
may be &s;oftened, when &s;een from the water, into an ea&s;y curve.</P>
<P>The <HI>i&s;lands</HI> fall next under our view. The&s;e are either a beauty, or a deformity to the lake; as they are &s;haped, or &s;tationed.</P>
<P>If the i&s;land be round, or of any other re|gular form; or if the wood upon it be thick and heavy (as I have ob&s;erved &s;ome planted with a clo&s;e grove of Scotch fir) it can never be an object of beauty. At <HI>hand,</HI> it is a heavy lump: at a <HI>di&s;tance,</HI> a murky &s;pot.</P>
<P>Again, if the i&s;land, (however beautifully &s;haped, or planted;) be &s;eated in the centre of a round lake; in the focus of an oval one; or in any other <HI>regular</HI> po&s;ition; the beauty of it is lo&s;t, at lea&s;t in &s;ome points of view.</P>
<P>But when it's lines, and &s;hape are both irre|gular&mdash;when it is ornamented with ancient oak, rich in foliage, but light and airy&mdash;and when it takes &s;ome irregular &s;ituation in the lake; then it is an object truly beautiful&mdash;beautiful in it&s;elf, as well as in compo&s;ition. It mu&s;t how|ever be added, that it would be difficult to place &s;uch an object in any &s;ituation, that would be <HI>equally</HI> plea&s;ing from every &s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="150">The <HI>&s;urface of the lake</HI> offers it&s;elf la&s;t to ob|&s;ervation. The &s;everal incidents, which ari&s;e here, are all owing to the &s;ky, and the di&s;po&s;i|tion of the water to receive it's impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>That the &s;ky is the great regulator of the <HI>colour</HI> of the water, is known to all arti&s;ts.

<P>The effect indeed holds univer&s;ally; as water in all ca&s;es, expo&s;ed to the &s;ky, will act as a mirror to it.</P>
<P>In the darkne&s;s of a brooding &s;torm, we have ju&s;t &s;een, the <HI>whole body</HI> of the water will be dark: <HI>inhorruit unda tenebris.</HI></P>
<P>In clear, and windy weather, the <HI>breezy ruffled lake,</HI> as Thom&s;on calls it, is a &s;hattered mirror: It reflects the &s;erenity; but reflects it partially. The hollow of each wave is com|monly in &s;hadow, the &s;ummit is tipped with light. The light or &s;hadow therefore prevails, according to the po&s;ition of the waves to the eye:
<PB REF="151">
<FIGURE>

<PB N="100" REF="152">
Their lubricity is lo&s;t. More or le&s;s, they all flow <HI>cum gurgite flavo.</HI> But the lake, like Spencer's fountain, which &s;prang from the limpid tears of a nymph,
<Q><L>&mdash;is cha&s;t, and pure, as pure&s;t &s;now,</L>
<L>Ne lets her waves with any filth be dyed.</L></Q></P>
<P>Refined thus from every ob&s;truction, it is <HI>tremblingly alive</HI> all over: the mere&s;t trifle, a fri&s;king fly, a falling leaf, almo&s;t a &s;ound alarms it,
<Q><L>&mdash;that &s;ound,</L>
<L>Which from the mountain, previous to the &s;torm,</L>
<L>Rolls o'er the muttering earth, di&s;turbs the flood,</L>
<L>And &s;hakes the fore&s;t-leaf without a breath.</L></Q></P>
<P>This tremulous &s;hudder is &s;ometimes even &s;till more partial: It will run in lengthened parallels, and &s;eparate the reflections upon the &s;urface, which are lo&s;t on one &s;ide, and taken up on the other. This is perhaps the mo&s;t picture&s;que form, which water a&s;&s;umes; as it affords the painter an opportunity of throwing in tho&s;e lengthened lights and &s;hades, which give the greate&s;t variety and clearne&s;s to water.</P>
<P>There is another appearance on the &s;urfaces of lakes, which we cannot account for on any principle either of optics, or of per&s;pective.
<PB N="99" REF="153">
eye: and at a di&s;tance, when the &s;ummits of the waves, agreeably to the rules of per&s;pective, appear in <HI>contact,</HI> the whole &s;urface in that part will be light.</P>
<P>But when the &s;ky is &s;plendid, and at the &s;ame time calm, the water (being then a <HI>perfect</HI> mirror,) will glow all over with corre&s;pondent tints; unle&s;s other reflections, from the objects around, intervene, and form more vivid pic|tures.</P>
<P>Often you will &s;ee a &s;pacious bay, &s;creened by &s;ome projecting promontory, in perfect re|po&s;e; while the re&s;t of the lake, more pervious to the air, is cri&s;ped over by a gentle ripple.</P>
<P>Sometimes al&s;o, when the <HI>whole</HI> lake is tran|quil, a gentle perturbation will ari&s;e in &s;ome di&s;tant part, from no apparent cau&s;e, from a breath of air, which nothing el&s;e can feel, and creeping &s;oftly on, communicate the tremulous &s;hudder with exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility over half the &s;urface. In this ob&s;ervation I do little more than tran&s;late from Ovid:
<Q><L>&mdash;Exhorruit, aequoris in&s;tar,</L>
<L>Quod fremit, exigu&acirc; cum &s;ummum &s;tringitur aur&acirc;.</L></Q></P>
<P>No pool, no river-bay, can pre&s;ent this idea in it's utmo&s;t purity. In them every cry&s;talline particle is &s;et, as it were, in a &s;ocket of mud.
<PB N="101" REF="154">
When there is no apparent cau&s;e in the <HI>&s;ky,</HI> the <HI>water</HI> will &s;ometimes appear dappled with large &s;pots of &s;hade. It is po&s;&s;ible the&s;e patches may have connection with the bottom of the lake; as naturali&s;ts &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;hining parts of the &s;ea are occa&s;ioned by the &s;pawn of fi&s;h: but it is more probable, that in &s;ome way, they are connected with the &s;ky, as they are generally e&s;teemed in the country to be a weather-gage. The people will often &s;ay,

Tho, after all, I think it probable the&s;e &s;hades may be owing only to floating clouds.</P>
<P>From this great variety, which the &s;urfaces of lakes a&s;&s;ume, we may draw this conclu&s;ion, that the painter may take great liberties, in point of light and &s;hade, in his repre&s;entation of water. It is, in many ca&s;es, under no rule, that we are acquainted with; or under rules &s;o

<P>On the &s;ubject of <HI>lakes,</HI> I have only farther to add, that many bodies of water, under this denomination, are found upon the <HI>&s;ummits</HI> of lofty mountains. In this &s;ituation they are commonly mere ba&s;ons; or re&s;ervoirs; and want the plea&s;ing accompaniments, which adorn the lower lakes.

<P>WE have now made a con&s;iderable advance towards a land&s;cape. The &s;ky is laid in; a mountain fills the offskip; and a lake, with it's accompaniments, takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a nearer di&s;tance. Nothing but a <HI>fore-ground</HI> is wanting; and for this we have great choice of objects&mdash;<HI>broken ground&mdash;trees&mdash;rocks&mdash;ca&s;cades</HI> &mdash;and <HI>vallies.</HI></P>
<P>In a <HI>di&s;tance</HI> the ruling character is <HI>tender|ne&s;s;</HI> which on a <HI>fore-ground,</HI> gives way to what the painter calls <HI>force,</HI> and <HI>richne&s;s. Force</HI> ari&s;es from a violent oppo&s;ition of colour, light, and &s;hade: <HI>richne&s;s</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in a variety of parts, and glowing tints. In &s;ome degree, <HI>richne&s;s</HI> is found in a di&s;tance; but never, united with <HI>force:</HI> for in a <HI>di&s;tance;</HI> tho the <HI>lights</HI> may be &s;trong, and the parts varied; yet
<PB N="104" REF="157">
the &s;hades and tints will ever be faint, and tender.</P>
<P>In the mean time, this oppo&s;ition on the fore-ground, violent as it is, mu&s;t always be &s;ubject to the <HI>ruling ma&s;&s;es</HI> of light and &s;hade, and colouring, which harmonize the whole.</P>
<P>The effect of this harmony is <HI>breadth,</HI> or <HI>repo&s;e.</HI> It's oppo&s;ite is <HI>flutter,</HI> and <HI>confu&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>It appears therefore, that the management of fore-grounds is a matter of great nicety.

Whereas, at a <HI>di&s;tance,</HI> an irregular da&s;h of the pencil, if it be not one thing, may be conceived to be another: ob&s;curity is there a &s;ource of beauty. &mdash;Hence it is, that many great ma&s;ters, who can throw a di&s;tance into a plea&s;ing confu&s;ion, and give it the effect of nature; have failed in exerci&s;ing their art on a fore-ground.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="158">Having premi&s;ed thus much with regard to fore-grounds <HI>in general,</HI> let us now examine the <HI>fore-grounds,</HI> which are pre&s;ented to us in this very picture&s;que country.</P>

It has, in &s;ome degree, the effect of better trees in a di&s;tance; but it is very deficient, when we call for an ancient oak to give the fore-ground
<PB N="106" REF="159">
ground a grandeur equal to the &s;cene&mdash;when we want the magnificence of it's &s;hadowing form to mantle over the vacant corner of a land&s;cape&mdash;when we wi&s;h it to hide &s;ome heavy promontory; or to &s;catter a few loo&s;e branches over &s;ome ill-&s;haped mountain-line&mdash;when it's ma&s;&s;y foliage is nece&s;&s;ary to give depth to &s;hade &mdash;it's twi&s;ted bole, covered with grey mo&s;s, to oppo&s;e the vivid green in it's neighbourhood &mdash;or, la&s;tly, it's warm autumnal tint to contra&s;t the colder hues of di&s;tance. In all the&s;e ca&s;es a deficiency of fore&s;t-wood is &s;ometimes re|gretted in the &s;cenery before us; but not often: and where it is, the lo&s;s is ea&s;ily &s;upplied by other objects; among which rocks are the principal: and the&s;e, when ornamented with wood, tho of a &s;maller &s;ize, have generally the effect of the mo&s;t luxuriant foliage.</P>
<P><HI>Rocks</HI> differ in <HI>&s;urface; general form;</HI> and <HI>colour.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>rock naturally</HI> wears that <HI>&s;mooth</HI> weather-beaten &s;urface, which time gives it through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages. But rocks, firm as they are, are &s;ubject to change. Springs undermine them: torrents wa&s;h the earth from around
<PB N="107" REF="160">
them: fro&s;ts loo&s;en them; and &s;ometimes they are torn by &s;torms and earthquakes. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, when large ma&s;&s;es fall away, the rock exhibits a <HI>fractured</HI> &s;urface; which in general has a better effect, than the &s;mooth one. Nature, in the&s;e in&s;tances, may be &s;aid to retouch her compo&s;itions: the frac|tured parts are larger and &s;harper; and better adapted to receive either &s;mart, catching lights; or a body of light and &s;hade.&mdash;An humble imitation of the &s;urfaces of fractured rocks is &s;ometimes exhibited in large coals: they may at lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t the imagination of a painter.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>general form</HI> of rocks, both &s;pecies, the <HI>&s;mooth,</HI> and the <HI>fractured,</HI> have equal variety. Both have their bold pro|jections&mdash;both hang alike over their ba&s;es&mdash; are rifted into cha&s;ms&mdash;and &s;hoot &s;ometimes into horizontal, and &s;ometimes into diagonal &s;trata.</P>
<P>The <HI>natural colour</HI> of rocks is either <HI>grey,</HI> or <HI>red.</HI> We have of each kind in England; and both are beautiful: but the <HI>grey</HI> rock, (which is the common &s;pecies in <HI>this</HI> &s;cenery) makes the finer contra&s;t with the foliage either of &s;ummer, or of autumn.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="161">I call <HI>red,</HI> and <HI>grey</HI> the natural <HI>colours</HI> of rocks; but more properly they are the <HI>ground</HI> only of a variety of tints. The&s;e tints ari&s;e from weeds, mo&s;&s;es, and lychens of various kinds, which uniting together on the &s;urface of a rock, often make a rich, and very harmo|monious a&s;&s;emblage of colouring; and the painter, who does not attend to the&s;e <HI>minutiae</HI> (we are con&s;idering <HI>fore-grounds</HI>) lo&s;es half the beauty of his original.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e lychens, the white &s;pecies is the lea&s;t plea&s;ing. When mixed with other tints, it may form an agreeable contra&s;t: and even, when it borrows no aid of this kind, if it be &s;paringly, and happily introduced, it may add a beauty to the natural colour of the <HI>grey</HI> rock, by giving it the brilliancy of a few &s;harp touches. But when it <HI>prevails;</HI> and &s;preads, like a bald leprous &s;cab, over a <HI>whole</HI> &s;urface; it's mealy hue is very di&s;gu&s;ting, unle&s;s it be thrown into &s;hadow, or &s;upported by &s;ome ma&s;s of foliage, or other vivid tint in contact with it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;pecies of rocks ju&s;t de&s;cribed, there is another, called the <HI>cragg;</HI> which con|veys the idea of a rock roughly pounded. With the&s;e &s;hattered fragments whole &s;ides of
<PB N="109" REF="162">
mountains are often covered; down which they appear continually to &s;hiver. This &s;pecies is very inferior to the former. It wants that breadth of &s;urface, which gives dignity to an object. In a <HI>di&s;tance</HI> indeed, which melts the fragments into one ma&s;s, the effect is good: but in the &s;ituation, in which we are now con|&s;idering rocks, as the appendages of a <HI>fore-ground,</HI> the <HI>cragg</HI> is meanly circum&s;tanced.</P>
<P>The <HI>ca&s;cade,</HI> which is the next object of our ob&s;ervation, may be divided into the <HI>broken,</HI> and the <HI>regular</HI> fall.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> belongs mo&s;t properly to the rock; who&s;e projecting fragments, impeding the wa|ter, break it into pieces&mdash;da&s;h it into foam&mdash; and give it all the &s;pirit, and agitation, which that active element is capable of receiving.&mdash; Happy is the pencil, which can &s;eize the varie|ties, and brilliancy of water under this circum|&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the <HI>regular</HI> fall the water meets no ob|&s;truction; but pours down, from the higher grounds to the lower, in one &s;plendid &s;heet.</P>
<P>Each kind hath it's beauties; but, in gene|ral, the <HI>broken</HI> fall is more adapted to a &s;mall
<PB N="110" REF="163">
body of water; and the <HI>regular</HI> to a large one. The &s;mall body of water has nothing to re|commend it, but it's variety and bu&s;tle: where|as the large body has a dignity of character to maintain. To fritter <HI>it</HI> in pieces would be to de&s;troy in a degree the grandeur of it's effect. Were the Niagara thus broken, at lea&s;t if &s;ome con&s;iderable parts of it were not left broad and &s;heety, it might be a grand &s;cene of confu&s;ion; but it could not be that va&s;t, that uniform, and &s;imple object, which is mo&s;t capable of expre&s;&s;ing the idea of greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>As there are few <HI>con&s;iderable</HI> rivers in the romantic country, we are now examining, the mo&s;t beautiful ca&s;cades, (which are innumera|ble) are generally of the <HI>broken</HI> kind. The <HI>regular</HI> falls (of which al&s;o there are many) are objects of little value. Tho they are &s;ome|times four or five hundred feet in height; yet they appear only like threads of &s;ilver at a di&s;tance; and like mere &s;pouts at hand; void both of grandeur, and variety.&mdash;And yet, in heavy rains, &s;ome of them mu&s;t be very noble, if we may judge from their channels, which often &s;hew great marks of violence.&mdash;But I was never fortunate enough to &s;ee any of them in the&s;e moments of wildne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="164">The&s;e two kinds of ca&s;cades, the <HI>broken,</HI> and the <HI>regular,</HI> may be combined. If the weight of water be &s;mall, it is true, it will admit only the <HI>broken</HI> fall: but if it be large, it may with propriety admit a combination of both: and the&s;e combinations may be multi|plied into each other with endle&s;s variety.</P>
<P>The <HI>regular</HI> fall admits al&s;o another mode of variety by forming it&s;elf into what may be called the <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive fall;</HI> in which the water, in&s;tead of making one continued &s;hoot, falls through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of different &s;tories. Of this kind are many of the mountain-ca&s;cades in this country, which are often very beautiful; e&s;pecially where the &s;tages are deranged; and the water <HI>&s;eeks</HI> it's way from one &s;tage to ano|ther.</P>
<P>This is the &s;pecies of ca&s;cade, which was the great object of imitation in all the anti|quated water-works of the la&s;t age. Our fore-fathers admired the <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive fall;</HI> and, agree|ably to their awkward mode of imitation, made the water de&s;cend a <HI>regular</HI> flight of &s;tone-&s;tairs.</P>
<P>Before we conclude the &s;ubject of ca&s;cades, it may be ob&s;erved, that, as in other objects of beauty, &s;o in this, proportion mu&s;t be a
<PB N="112" REF="165">
regulating principle. I &s;hall not be &s;o preci&s;e as to &s;ay, what is the exact proportion of an elegant ca&s;cade. Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary. The <HI>eye</HI> will ea&s;ily &s;ee the enormity of <HI>di&s;proportion,</HI> where it exi&s;ts in any great degree: and that is enough. Thus when a mountain-ca&s;cade falls four or five hundred feet, and is perhaps &s;carce two yards broad; every eye mu&s;t &s;ee the di&s;|proportion: as it will al&s;o, when the whole breadth of &s;ome large river falls only two or three feet. Both would be more beautiful, if their falls held a nearer proportion to their quantities of water.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;pecies of <HI>fore-grounds</HI> are <HI>vallies</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let it be ob&s;erved, that the terms <HI>vale,</HI> and <HI>valley;</HI> denote univer&s;ally, through this work, the greater, and &s;maller &s;cenes of the &s;ame kind. I con&s;ider <HI>valley</HI> as the diminutive of <HI>vale.</HI></NOTE>; with regard to which it mu&s;t be remarked fir&s;t, that <HI>narrow contracted vallies</HI> only are meant. The open valley mu&s;t cla&s;s it&s;elf among objects of <HI>di&s;tant</HI> &s;cenery.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t &s;econdly be remarked, that even <HI>contracted valleys</HI> are not <HI>purely</HI> of the nature of
<PB REF="166">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="113" REF="167">
fore-grounds, but <HI>participate</HI> of di&s;tance. One &s;ide-&s;creen mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a little <HI>removed,</HI> if you would give your &s;cenery the advantage of per&s;pective.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being premi&s;ed, we may con|&s;ider the <HI>valley</HI> as a &s;pecies of <HI>fore-ground;</HI> the ingredients of which Spencer hath given us in very few words.
<Q><L>Through woods, and mountains wild they came at la&s;t</L>
<L>Into a plea&s;ant dale, that lowly lay</L>
<L>Betwixt two hills, who&s;e high heads over placed,</L>
<L>The valley did with cool &s;hade overca&s;t:</L>
<L>Through mid&s;t thereof a little river rolled.</L></Q>
The&s;e ingredients admit great variety in compo|&s;ition. The &s;ides of the valley may be high, or low; rocky, or woody; &s;mooth, or full of jutting promontories: and the&s;e variations again may play into each other with a thou&s;and interchanges.</P>
<P>When we find a concurrence of beautiful circum&s;tances in the&s;e &s;cenes&mdash;when their &s;ides are well proportioned, and picture&s;quely adorn|ed&mdash;and e&s;pecially when they are &s;o fortunate as to open on a rich di&s;tance; a lake bounded by a rocky mountain; or any other intere&s;ting object, they form a land&s;cape of a very plea&s;ing kind.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="168">The rivers al&s;o with which the&s;e vallies &s;carce ever fail of being adorned, have the &s;ame variety as the hills; and may, now and then, be introduced very happily to a&s;&s;i&s;t the fore-ground. They are pure chry&s;talline &s;treams&mdash; generally rapid&mdash;generally &s;parkling over beds of pebbles&mdash;often tumbling, and foaming over the ledges of rocks&mdash;and forming, through the whole of their cour&s;e, a continuation of little bu&s;tling ca&s;cades.</P>
<P>Nearly allied to the <HI>contracted valley,</HI> is, what in <HI>this</HI> country, is called a <HI>gill;</HI> in <HI>others,</HI> a <HI>dell.</HI> It is a narrow cleft, winding between two rocky precipices; and overgrown with wood, which clo&s;es at the top, and almo&s;t excludes the day. Through the bottom foams a torrent. You hear it &s;ounding in it's fall from one rocky &s;tage to another: but it is rarely vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>The&s;e romantic &s;pots are generally imper|vious. When they are a little more open, &s;o as to allow a narrow foot-path to &s;tray among them, they are the mo&s;t beloved haunts of &s;olitude and meditation; and of all the parts
<PB N="115" REF="169">
of this delightful &s;cenery, afford the mo&s;t re|fre&s;hing refuge from noon-tide heat.</P>
<P>Such were the &s;cenes the poet panted after, when they drew from his &s;oul, oppre&s;&s;ed by the languor of a &s;ummer-&s;un, that ardent a&s;|piration;

<HI>Dat &s;onitum,</HI> &s;ays this accurate ob&s;erver of nature; remarking in that expre&s;&s;ion, that the torrent was an addre&s;s to the ear, not to the eye.</P>
<P>The <HI>contracted valley,</HI> we have &s;een, may open to a <HI>di&s;tance;</HI> but a view into the <HI>gill</HI> furni&s;hes only a <HI>fore-ground.</HI> It can only con|&s;i&s;t of &s;ome little &s;eque&s;tered rece&s;s&mdash;a few twi&s;ted boles&mdash;a ca&s;cade &s;parkling through the trees&mdash;or a tran&s;lucent pool, formed in the cavity beneath &s;ome rock, and ju&s;t large enough to reflect the hanging wood, which over &s;ha|dows

<P>WE have now examined the materials, of which the magnificent &s;cenery of this country is compo&s;ed&mdash;the <HI>di&s;tant mountain</HI>&mdash; the <HI>lake</HI>&mdash;and the <HI>fore-ground:</HI> but a few general ob&s;ervations on the&s;e materials, as <HI>united in compo&s;ition,</HI> may perhaps throw &s;ome new and picture&s;que lights on the whole.</P>
<P>In many countries much <HI>grander</HI> &s;cenes are exhibited, than the&s;e,&mdash;mountains more mag|nificent, and lakes more exten&s;ive: yet, it is probable there are few, in which the &s;everal objects are better proportioned; and united with more beauty.</P>
<P>In America the lakes are &s;eas; and the country on their banks, being removed of cour&s;e to a great di&s;tance, can add no accom|paniments.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="172">Among the <HI>&s;maller</HI> lakes of Italy and Swit|zerland, no doubt, there are many delightful &s;cenes: but the <HI>larger</HI> lakes, like tho&s;e of America, are di&s;proportioned to their accom|paniments: the water occupies too large a &s;pace, and throws the &s;cenery too much into di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The mountains of Sweden, Norway, and other northern regions, are probably rather ma&s;&s;es of hideous rudene&s;s, than &s;cenes of grandeur and proportion. Proportion indeed in all &s;cenery is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; and unle&s;s the lake, and it's corre&s;pondent moun|tains have this ju&s;t relation to each other, they want the fir&s;t principle of beauty.</P>
<P>The value of lake-&s;cenery ari&s;es rather from the idea of <HI>magnificence,</HI> than of <HI>variety.</HI> The &s;cene is not continually &s;hifting here, as on the banks of a winding river. The lake is &s;o va&s;t, that it &s;tands &s;till, as it were, before the moving eye. Nor is this attended with &s;atiety. A quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of imagery is nece&s;&s;ary in &s;cenes of le&s;s grandeur, where little beauties are ea&s;ily &s;canned: but &s;cenes, like the&s;e, de|mand contemplation. The&s;e rich volumes of
<PB N="119" REF="173">
nature, like the works of e&s;tabli&s;hed authors, will bear a frequent peru&s;al. Contemplation adds to their value.</P>
<P>In the mean time, with all this magnifi|cence and beauty, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that every &s;cene, which the&s;e countries pre&s;ent, is <HI>correctly picture&s;que.</HI> In &s;uch immen&s;e bodies of rough-hewn matter, many irregularities, and even many deformities, mu&s;t exi&s;t, which a practi&s;ed eye would wi&s;h to correct. Moun|tains are &s;ometimes crouded&mdash;their &s;ides are often bare, when contra&s;t requires them to be wooded&mdash;promontories form the water-boun|dary into acute angles&mdash;and bays are contracted into narrow points, in&s;tead of &s;welling into ample ba&s;ons.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e ca&s;es the imagination is apt to whi&s;per, What glorious &s;cenes might here be made, if the&s;e &s;tubborn materials could yield to the judicious hand of art!&mdash;And, to &s;ay the truth, we are &s;ometimes tempted to let the imagination loo&s;e among them.</P>
<P>By the force of this creative power an intervening hill may be turned a&s;ide; and a di&s;tance introduced.&mdash;This ill-&s;haped moun|tain
<PB N="120" REF="174">
may be pared, and formed into a better line.&mdash;To that, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, a light|ne&s;s may be given by the addition of a higher &s;ummit,&mdash;Upon yon bald declivity, which &s;tretches along the lake, may be reared a fore&s;t of noble oak; which thinly &s;catter'd over the top, will thicken as it de&s;cends; and throw it's vivid reflections on the water in full luxuri|ance.</P>
<P>The line of the water too, which perhaps is &s;traight, the imagination will ea&s;ily correct. It will bring forward &s;ome bold promontory; or open &s;ome winding bay.</P>
<P>It will proceed even to the ornaments of art. On &s;ome projecting knoll it will rear the maje&s;ty of a ruined ca&s;tle, who&s;e ivyed walls &s;eem a part of the very rock, on which they &s;tand. On a gentle ri&s;e, opening to the lake, and half incircled by woody hills, &s;ome mouldring abbey may be &s;eated; and far beyond may appear di&s;tant objects, under &s;ome circum|&s;tance of picture&s;que illumination:
<Q>The fore&s;t <HI>darkening</HI> round, and <HI>glittering</HI> &s;pire.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the imagination will a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e &s;cenes, which, tho replete with beauties beyond it's power to create, may contain deformities,
<PB N="121" REF="175">
which it might wi&s;h to remove. It corrects one part of nature by another; and compo&s;es a land&s;cape, as the arti&s;t compo&s;ed his cele|brated Venus, by &s;electing accordant beauties from different originals. Scarce any <HI>&s;ingle</HI> archetype is &s;ufficiently correct. Any other idea of <HI>improving</HI> nature is ab&s;urd; and can be adopted only by men of fal&s;e ta&s;te, who ima|gine they <HI>improve</HI> her by an addition of heterogeneous decorations.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>improvement</HI> of &s;uch <HI>va&s;t &s;cenes</HI> as the&s;e, it is in every &s;hape, except by a little planting, beyond all power of art. I cannot therefore be under&s;tood to &s;ugge&s;t improvement here. All we get by imagining, how &s;uch a country as this might be improved, is merely a little practice in the rules of picture&s;que com|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>We may remark further, that the power which the imagination hath over the&s;e &s;cenes, is not greater, than the power, which they have over the imagination. No tame country, however beautiful, however adorned, can di&s;|tend the mind, like this awful, and maje&s;tic &s;cenery. The wild &s;allies of untutored genius
<PB N="122" REF="176">
often &s;trike the imagination more, than the mo&s;t correct effu&s;ions of cultivated parts. Tho the <HI>eye</HI> therefore might take more plea&s;ure in a view (con&s;idered <HI>merely in a picture&s;que light</HI>) when a little adorned by the hand of art; yet I much doubt, whether &s;uch a view would have that &s;trong effect on the <HI>imagination;</HI> as when rough with all it's bold irregularities about it; when beauty, and deformity, grandeur and horror, mingled together, &s;trike the mind with a thou&s;and oppo&s;ing ideas; and like chymical infu&s;ions of an oppo&s;ite nature, produce an efferve&s;cence, which no harmonious mixtures could produce.</P>
<Q><L>Surely there is a hidden power, that reigns</L>
<L>'Mid the lone maje&s;ty of untamed nature,</L>
<L>Controuling &s;ober rea&s;on&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Were a lover of nature placed <HI>abruptly</HI> in the mid&s;t of &s;uch &s;cenes as the&s;e, the effect might be too &s;trong: and in this in&s;tance, as in others, he might di&s;cover the weakne&s;s of his fir&s;t progenitor; in whom, on viewing &s;uddenly a grand land&s;cape, we are told,
<Q><L>So deep the power of tho&s;e ingredients pierced,</L>

<P>But nature, which brings out the &s;un through the medium of twilight, hath in this ca&s;e al&s;o provided for the weakne&s;s of the vi&s;ual nerve. The&s;e grand &s;cenes are <HI>gradually</HI> introduced. The idea grows imperceptibly to maturity. The great &s;tones of ye&s;terday become rocks to|day. Hills, in a few &s;tages, are converted into mountains; and we &s;ee, now and then, the glimp&s;e of a lake; before the eye is filled with the whole va&s;t, &s;plendid &s;urface of it.</P>
<P>If the imagination be thus fired by the&s;e romantic &s;cenes even in their <HI>common</HI> &s;tate, how much more may we &s;uppo&s;e it wrought on, when they &s;trike us under &s;ome <HI>extraordinary</HI> circum&s;tance of beauty, or terror&mdash;in the tran|quility of a calm, or the agitation of a &s;torm?</P>
<P>Some &s;cenes, particularly of the &s;ylvan kind, are perhaps be&s;t &s;uited to a calm. They receive their principal beauty from the <HI>richne&s;s</HI> of the objects; which is improved by chearful and &s;plendid lights.</P>
<P>Other &s;cenes, le&s;s inriched by objects, are meagre in a calm, and glaring &s;un&s;hine. A

bright hemi&s;phere only renders their poverty more apparent. To &s;uch &s;cenes a &s;torm, which produces &s;ublime ideas by heaving clouds, and bur&s;ting lights, gives an adventitious con&s;e|quence, and leads the eye, in it's pur&s;uit of <HI>objects,</HI> to the <HI>grandeur of the effect.</HI></P>
<P>But there are &s;ome &s;cenes in nature, which are adapted to both circum&s;tances&mdash;none more, than the &s;cenery of lakes&mdash;none perhaps &s;o much.</P>

<P>If an artificial mirror, a few inches long, placed oppo&s;ite to a door, or a window, occa|&s;ions often very plea&s;ing reflections; how noble mu&s;t be the appearance, when an area of many leagues in circumference, is formed into one va&s;t mirror; and this mirror &s;urrounded by a combination of great, and beautiful objects?

<L>All but the &s;wellings of the &s;often'd heart;</L>
<L>That waken, not di&s;turb, the tranquil mind.</L></Q></P>
<P>When the mind has a little recovered it's tone, from the <HI>general</HI> impre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a &s;cene; it feels a new plea&s;ure in examining more minutely the &s;everal picture&s;que ingre|dients, which produced it&mdash;the &s;tillne&s;s, and purity of the air&mdash;the &s;trong lights and &s;hades &mdash;the tints upon the mountains&mdash;the poli&s;h of the lake&mdash;and, above all, the reflections di&s;|played upon it's bo&s;om, when

<PB N="126" REF="181">
lake&mdash;and fi&s;hing-boats extending their nets in dotted circles, and forming tremulous reflec|tions from their flaccid &s;ails.</P>
<P>When we take a view of &s;uch a glorious &s;cene in all it's &s;plendor, we regret, that it &s;hould ever be deformed by the rough bla&s;ts of <HI>tempe&s;t:</HI> and yet I know not, whether, under this lat|ter circum&s;tance, it may not have a &s;till greater <HI>power over the imagination.</HI> Every little idea is lo&s;t in the wild uproar and confu&s;ion of &s;uch a &s;cene.</P>
<P>Nor is it in this di&s;turbed &s;tate, le&s;s an <HI>object of picture&s;que beauty.</HI> The &s;ky floating with broken clouds&mdash;the mountains half ob&s;cured by driving vapours; and mingling with the &s;ky in awful ob&s;curity&mdash;the trees &s;training in the bla&s;t &mdash;and the lake &s;tirred from the bottom, and whitening every rocky promontory with it's foam; are all objects highly adapted to the pencil.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the tempe&s;t, if a bright &s;un-beam &s;hould &s;uddenly break out; and in Shake|&s;pear's language, <HI>light up the &s;torm,</HI> the &s;cenery of an agitated lake, thus a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the powers of contra&s;t, affects both the <HI>imagination,</HI> and
<PB N="127" REF="182">
the <HI>eye,</HI> in a &s;till greater degree. Some broad mountain-&s;ide, catching a ma&s;s of light, pro|duces an a&s;toni&s;hing effect amid&s;t the leaden gloom, which &s;urrounds it. Perhaps a &s;un-beam, half-&s;uffu&s;ed in vapour, darting between two mountains, may &s;tretch along the water in a lengthened gleam, ju&s;t as the &s;kiff pa&s;&s;es to receive the light upon it's &s;welling &s;ail: while the &s;ea-gull, wheeling along the &s;torm, turns it's &s;ilvery &s;ide, &s;trongly illumined, again&s;t the bo&s;om of &s;ome lurid cloud; and by that &s;ingle touch of oppo&s;ition, gives double darkne&s;s to the ri&s;ing tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>Compared with &s;uch &s;cenes, how inanimate do the &s;ubjects of Canaletti appear!&mdash;how flat his &s;quare canals, and formal &s;treet-per&s;pective; when oppo&s;ed to &s;preading lakes, and &s;weeping mountains!&mdash;the puny labours of men, to the bold, irregular &s;cenery of nature! Nor can we help regretting the lo&s;s of &s;uch pictures as might have been produced, if Canaletti's free pencil had been thrown loo&s;e in &s;uch a country as this.</P>
<P>But the&s;e &s;cenes are not only &s;uperior to the &s;ubjects of Canaletti; but to tho&s;e of a greater
<PB N="128" REF="183">
ma&s;ter, the younger Vanderveld. Sea-views, tho grander in &s;ome re&s;pects, are, on the whole, inferior to the views before us. Their great deficiency is the want of variety in their ac|companiments. One &s;pecies of them indeed, and but one, is &s;uperior to the utmo&s;t efforts of the lake&mdash;the &s;egment of &s;ome land-locked bay; which, in a &s;torm e&s;pecially, is a noble &s;ubject: the waters are more agitated, and form bolder &s;wells; which, of cour&s;e, receive grander effects of light. Here too, in&s;tead of the dancing &s;kiff, we are pre&s;ented with the terrors of &s;hipwreck. The beacon al&s;o, &s;eated on a bleak eminence, marks the coa&s;t with pe|culiar danger; while the di&s;tant port-town, di&s;covered by a gleam of light under the &s;ha|dowing cliff, makes the &s;cene &s;till more affect|ing by the exclu&s;ion of hope within &s;ight of &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>I have only farther to ob&s;erve, in <HI>general,</HI> on the &s;cenes of this romantic country, that they are &s;ubject to violent convul&s;ions of vari|ous kinds. Every thing, here, is in the grand &s;tyle. The very elements, when they do mi&s;|chief,
<PB N="129" REF="184">
keep in uni&s;on with it, and perform all their operations with an air of dignity.</P>
<P>Upon &s;ome of the mountains, particularly on Cro&s;s-fell, a bla&s;t, called in the country, a <HI>helm-wind,</HI> will &s;ometimes ari&s;e &s;uddenly, of a nature &s;o violent, that nothing can with&s;tand it's force. The experienced mountaineer, as he traver&s;es tho&s;e wild regions, fore&s;eeing it's approach, throws him&s;elf flat upon the ground; and lets it pa&s;s over him. It's rage is momen|tary: and the air in&s;tantly &s;ettles into it's former calm.</P>
<P>The&s;e hurricanes are not uncommon in other mountainous countries. Mr. Mi&s;&s;on particu|larly &s;peaking of the mountains near In&s;pruck, tells us, that the winds often force their way through their hollow parts, as if through pipes, and rai&s;e &s;uch furious hurricanes, as will &s;ometimes root up, not only trees; but even rocks.</P>
<P>The lake too is &s;ubject to &s;omething of the &s;ame kind of emotion; which the inhabitants of the country call a <HI>bottom-wind.</HI> Often,
<PB N="130" REF="185">
when all is calm, and re&s;plendent around; as the boat is plying it's &s;teady way; the boat|man will de&s;cry at a di&s;tance (happy that it is &s;o) a violent ebullition of the water. He will &s;ee it heave and &s;well; forced upwards by &s;ome internal convul&s;ion; and &s;uffering all the agitation of a &s;torm. But as &s;oon as the con|fined air has &s;pent it's force, the agitated &s;ur|face immediately &s;ub&s;ides.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e <HI>bottom-winds</HI> al&s;o we meet with frequent accounts: particularly in &s;ome of the Sweedi&s;h lakes, which are very &s;ubject to them.</P>
<P>Something of this kind, &s;eems to have given Spencer an idea, which he introduces in his <HI>idle lake:</HI>
<Q><L>The waves come rolling, and the billows roar,</L>
<L>Outrageou&s;ly as they engaged were:</L>
<L>But not one puff of wind there did appear.</L></Q></P>
<P>Often al&s;o a va&s;t body of water, collected in the entrails of a mountain, it is &s;aid, will force a way through it's &s;ide; and ru&s;hing down the declivity, take it's cour&s;e through the valley; where it is not uncommon to &s;ee the marks of it's deva&s;tation.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="186">The &s;ame effects are &s;ometimes produced by <HI>water-&s;pouts,</HI> which, in countries like the&s;e, are collected, as at &s;ea, and fall upon moun|tains.</P>
<P>The <HI>avalanche,</HI> or fall of &s;now, is common here too, as in other mountainous countries. Inundations al&s;o are occa&s;ioned by it's &s;udden melting.</P>
<P>But the fall of cliffs, and large fragments of mountains, loo&s;ened by rain, and fro&s;t, pro|duces one of the greate&s;t &s;cenes of terror, which belongs to this romantic country; and to which we are chiefly indebted for that variety of fractured rock, and broken ground, which are among it's greate&s;t ornaments. Vir|gil has given us a de&s;cription of this kind in great perfection.

<P>AMBLESIDE is an ordinary village; but delightfully &s;eated. A cove of lofty mountains half incircles it on the north; and the lake of Wynander opens in front; near the &s;hores of which it &s;tands.</P>
<P>The ground between it and the mountains, which are at lea&s;t two miles di&s;tant, is various, broken, and woody. A mountain-torrent, about half a mile from the village, forms a grand ca&s;cade; but it was &s;o overgrown with thickets, that we had no point of view to &s;ee it from, but the top; which is the mo&s;t unpicture&s;que we could have.</P>
<P>From this fall the &s;tream ru&s;hes along a narrow valley, or <HI>gill,</HI> luxuriantly adorned with rock, and wood: and winding through it about a mile, emerges near the head of the lake, into which it enters. This <HI>gill</HI> was
<PB N="134" REF="189">
&s;o overgrown with wood, that it appeared al|mo&s;t impervious: but if a path could be carried through it, and the whole a little opened, it might be made very beautiful. A &s;cene in it&s;elf &s;o plea&s;ing, with a noble ca&s;cade at one end, and an exten&s;ive lake at the other, could not fail, to &s;trike the imagination in the mo&s;t forcible manner.</P>
<P>From Amble&s;ide we &s;et out for Bowne&s;s, to take a view of the lake. Part of the road we had traver&s;ed, the day before, from Ken|dal; and were a &s;econd time amu&s;ed by the woody land&s;cape it afforded; and it's &s;udden, interrupted openings to the lake, before the whole bur&s;t of that magnificent &s;cene was pre&s;ented.&mdash;From the higher grounds, above Bowne&s;s, we had an elevated view of it's whole extent.</P>
<P>Windermere, or Winander-water, as it is &s;ometimes called, extends from north to &s;outh, about twelve or fourteen miles. In breadth, it rarely exceeds two; and is &s;eldom narrower than one. The &s;outhern end winds a little towards the we&s;t. The northern, and we&s;t|tern coa&s;ts are wild, and mountainous&mdash;the ea&s;tern, and &s;outhern are more depre&s;&s;ed; in
<PB REF="190">

&s;ome parts cultivated, in others woody. Op|po&s;ite to Bowne&s;s, the lake is divided into two parts by a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands; one of which is larger than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Bowne&s;s is the capital port-town on the lake; if we may adopt a dignified &s;tyle, which the grandeur of the country naturally &s;ugge&s;ts. It is the great mart for fi&s;h, and charcoal; both which commodities are largely imported here; and carried by land into the country. It's harbour is crouded with ve&s;&s;els of various kinds; &s;ome of which are u&s;ed merely as plea&s;ure-boats in navigating the lake.&mdash;In one of the&s;e we embarked, and &s;tanding out to &s;ea; made for the great i&s;land; which we were informed was a very intere&s;ting &s;cene.</P>
<P>We &s;oon arrived at it; and landing at the &s;outh end, we ordered our boat to meet us at the north point; meaning to traver&s;e it's little boundaries.</P>
<P>A more &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot cannot ea&s;ily be conceived. Nothing can be more excluded from the noi&s;e, and interruption of life; or abound with a greater variety of tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, which make retirement plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The whole i&s;land contains about thirty acres. It's form is oblong: it's &s;hores irregular; retiring into bays, and broken into creeks.
<PB N="136" REF="193">
The &s;urface too is uneven; and a &s;ort of little Appennine ridge runs through the middle of it; falling down, in all &s;hapes, into the water. &mdash;Like it's great mother-i&s;land, the &s;outhern part wears a &s;moother a&s;pect, than the northern, which is broken, and rocky.</P>
<P>Formerly the whole i&s;land was one entire grove. At pre&s;ent, it is rather bare of wood; tho there are &s;ome large oaks upon it.</P>
<P>One of it's greate&s;t beauties ari&s;es from that irregular little Appennine, ju&s;t mentioned, which extends from one end to the other. This circum&s;tance hides it's <HI>in&s;ularity,</HI> by con|necting it with the continent. In every part, except on the high grounds, you &s;tand in an amphitheatre compo&s;ed of the noble&s;t ob|jects; and the lake performing the office of a &s;unk fence, the grandeur of each part of the continent is called in, by turns, to aid the in&s;ignificance of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The oblong form al&s;o of the lake gives the i&s;land another great advantage. On both it's <HI>&s;ides,</HI> the oppo&s;ite &s;hores of the continent are little more than half a mile di&s;tant: but at the northern and &s;outhern <HI>points</HI> there is a large &s;heet of water. The views therefore, as you walk round, are continually changing
<PB N="137" REF="194">
through all the varieties of <HI>di&s;tance;</HI> which are &s;till farther improved by a little degree of obliquity, in the po&s;ition of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>He who &s;hould take upon him to ornament &s;uch a &s;cene as this, would have only to con|duct his walk and plantations, &s;o as to take advantage of the grand parts of the continent around him;&mdash;to hide what is offen&s;ive&mdash;and, amid&s;t a choice of great and picture&s;que &s;cenes, to avoid &s;hewing too much. As he would have, at all times, an exuberance of water, he &s;hould not be o&s;tentatious in di&s;|playing it. It would be a relief to the eye &s;ometimes to exclude it wholly; and to in|troduce a mere &s;ylvan &s;cene, with di&s;tant mountains ri&s;ing above it. A tran&s;ient glance of the water, with &s;ome well-cho&s;en objects beyond it, would often al&s;o have a good effect; and &s;ometimes a grand expan&s;ion of the whole. &mdash;Thus the objects around, tho unmanage|able in them&s;elves, might be brought under command by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an in&s;ular &s;itu|ation.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>ornamenting</HI> of &s;uch a &s;cene, an elegant <HI>neatne&s;s</HI> is all the improver
<PB N="138" REF="195">
&s;hould aim at. Amid&s;t the&s;e grand objects of nature, it would be ab&s;urd to catch the eye with the <HI>affected</HI> decorations of art. The &s;imple idea he would de&s;ire to pre&s;erve, is, what the place it&s;elf &s;ugge&s;ts, a &s;eque&s;tered retreat. The <HI>boundaries</HI> &s;hould in a great mea&s;ure be thicket&mdash;on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t e&s;|pecially, which is oppo&s;ed to the only culti|vated part of the country: and if there be any thing in that part worth giving to the eye, it might be given through &s;ome <HI>unaffected</HI> opening.</P>
<P>For thickets, the wild wood of the coun|try would abundantly &s;uffice. It grows luxu|riantly, and would &s;oon produce it's effect.</P>
<P>The middle parts of the i&s;land, with a few clumps properly di&s;po&s;ed, might be neat pa&s;turage, with flocks, and herds; which would contra&s;t agreeably with the rough &s;cenery around.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e, at pre&s;ent, &s;tands too formally in the middle of the i&s;land. It might &s;tand better near the &s;outhern promontory.

<P><PB N="139" REF="196">This i&s;land belonged formerly to the Philip|&s;ons, a family of note in We&s;tmoreland. Du|ring the civil wars, two of them, an elder, and a younger brother, &s;erved the king. The former, who was the proprietor of it, com|manded a regiment: the latter was a major.</P>
<P>The major, who&s;e name was Robert, was a man of great &s;pirit, and enterprize; and for his many &s;eats of per&s;onal bravery, had ob|tained, among the Oliverians of tho&s;e parts, the appellation of <HI>Robin the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>After the war &s;ub&s;ided, Col. Briggs, a &s;teady friend to the u&s;urpation, re&s;iding at Kendal, under the double character of a lead|ing magi&s;trate (for he was a ju&s;tice of the peace) and an active commander, held the country in awe. This per&s;on having heard, that Major Philip&s;on was at his brother's hou&s;e on the i&s;land in Windermere, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;eize, and puni&s;h a man, who
<PB N="140" REF="197">
had made him&s;elf &s;o particularly obnoxious. With this view he mu&s;tered a party, which he thought &s;ufficient; and went him&s;elf on the enterprize. How it was conducted, my au|thority <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Bourn's hi&s;t. of We&s;tmoreland.</NOTE> does not inform us&mdash;whether he got together the navigation of the lake, and blockaded the place by &s;ea; or whether, he landed, and carried on his approaches in form. Neither do we learn the &s;trength of the gar|ri&s;on within; nor of the works without: tho every gentleman's hou&s;e was, at that time, in &s;ome degree a fortre&s;s. All we learn, is, that Major Philip&s;on endured a &s;eige of eight, or ten days with great gallantry; till his bro|ther, the colonel, hearing of his di&s;tre&s;s, rai&s;ed a party, and relieved him.</P>
<P>It was now the major's turn to make re|prizals. He put him&s;elf therefore at the head of a little troop of hor&s;e, and rode to Kendal, where Col. Briggs re&s;ided. Here being in|formed, that the colonel was at prayers, (for it was on a &s;unday morning) he &s;tationed his men properly in the avenues; and him&s;elf, armed, rode directly into the church. It is
<PB N="141" REF="198">
&s;aid, he intended to &s;eize the colonel, and carry him off: but as this &s;eems to have been totally impracticable, it is rather probable, that his intention was to kill him on the &s;pot; and in the mid&s;t of the confu&s;ion, to e&s;cape. Whatever his intention was, it was fru&s;trated; for Briggs happened to be el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The congregation, as might be expected, was thrown into great confu&s;ion on &s;eeing an armed man, on hor&s;eback, enter the church; and the major taking the advantage of their a&s;toni&s;hment, turned his hor&s;e round, and rode quietly out. But having given an alarm, he was pre&s;ently a&s;&s;aulted as he left the church: and being &s;eized; his girths were cut; and he was unhor&s;ed.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant, his party made a furious attack on the a&s;&s;ailants; and the major, kill|ing with his own hand, the man, who had &s;eized him, clapped the &s;addle, ungirthed as it was, upon his hor&s;e; and vaulting into it, rode full &s;peed through the &s;treets of Kendal, calling to his men to follow him; and with his whole party made a &s;afe retreat to his a&s;ylum in the lake.&mdash;The action marked the man. Many knew him; and they who did not, knew as well from the exploit, that it
<PB N="142" REF="199">
could be nobody, but <HI>Robin the Devil.</HI>&mdash; Such are the calamities of civil war! After the direful effects of public oppo&s;ition cea&s;e; revenge, and private malice long keep alive the animo&s;ity of individuals.</P>

<P>HAVING thus taken a view of a place abounding with &s;o many beauties, we found our bark waiting for us at the northern point; and &s;etting &s;ail, in&s;tead of returning to Bowne&s;s, we &s;tood for Amble&s;ide. We could have wi&s;hed to navigate the whole lake; but it was too great an undertaking for mea|&s;ured time; and we contented our&s;elves with going in que&s;t of the beauties of it's northern divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>As we left the i&s;land, the &s;cene opening on every &s;ide, we found our&s;elves &s;urrounded with objects of great magnificence.</P>
<P>On the we&s;tern coa&s;t ran a continuous range of craggy mountains, thinly &s;cattered over with trees, which had formerly over&s;pread it. It is a part of Furne&s;s-fell; the whole of which
<PB N="144" REF="201">
we had before &s;een, in one va&s;t combination of di&s;tant mountains, bounding our view over the bay of Cartmel. The part we now &s;aw &s;tretches about two leagues along the lake.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;tern &s;ide, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, &s;ome of which were well-wooded; others were mere rocks with low, twi&s;ted trees bur&s;ting from their crevices; all of them pro|bably worth vi&s;iting, if our time had allowed. Through the openings of the&s;e i&s;lands, we had partial views of the ea&s;tern coa&s;t; till having advanced further through this little archipelago into the body of the lake, the whole ea&s;tern &s;kreen opened to the eye&mdash;This &s;ide, tho le&s;s magnificent than the mountains of Furne&s;s on the left, contains however more variety. It is broken into hills; &s;ome of which are culti|vated, and others covered with wood.</P>
<P>But, on the whole, neither of the&s;e &s;ide-&s;creens is an object purely <HI>picture&s;que.</HI> The we&s;tern &s;hore is great indeed; but it is an unvaried ma&s;s of heavy greatne&s;s.

<P>As we advanced in our voyage, this great divi&s;ion of the lake (from the i&s;lands to it's northern point,) tho really oblong, a&s;&s;umed the form of a va&s;t circular ba&s;on: and the rough mountains, ari&s;ing round it, appeared, from &s;o &s;plended an area, with new grandeur. Indeed contra&s;t gave an additional force to the character of each.</P>
<P>This great &s;cene however, &s;urveyed thus from a centre, was rather amu&s;ing, than pic|ture&s;que. It was too exten&s;ive for the painter's u&s;e. A &s;mall portion of the circle, reduced to paper, or canvas, could have conveyed no idea; and a large &s;egment would have exceeded all the powers of the pallet.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="203">It is certainly an error in land&s;cape-painting, to comprehend too much. It turns a picture into a map. Nothing is more delu&s;ive, than to &s;uppo&s;e, that every view, which plea&s;es in nature, will plea&s;e in painting. In nature, the plea&s;ure ari&s;es from the eye's roaming from one pa&s;&s;age to another; and making it's re|marks on each. In painting, (as the eye is there confined within certain limits,) it ari&s;es from &s;eeing &s;ome &s;elect &s;pot adorned agreeably to the rules of art. And the painter, who wi&s;hes to make a plea&s;ing compo&s;ition, mu&s;t not include more than he can thus adorn. His fore-ground, and his di&s;tance mu&s;t bear a proportion to each other; which cannot be the ca&s;e, if he include a va&s;t compa&s;s. For as he can only take in a <HI>certain</HI> quantity of fore-ground; the removed parts of his picture &s;hould bear a proper proportion to it. Well-managed exceptions may be found: yet &s;till, in general, the rule is good.</P>
<P>But altho the whole of the amphitheatre we are now &s;urveying, was, in it's full dimen&s;ions, no &s;ubject for a picture; yet it exhibited many parts which, as di&s;tances, were purely pictu|re&s;que; and afforded an admirable collection of mountain &s;tudies for a painter. I &s;peak
<PB N="147" REF="204">
particularly of the front &s;kreen, in which the lines of the mountains were beautiful, and various&mdash;the inter&s;ections al&s;o of tho&s;e lines&mdash; the promontories; with the deep &s;hades they projected&mdash;and above all, the mountain colour|ing, which was the mo&s;t &s;plendid we had ever &s;een. Airy tints of vivid yellow, green, and purple, we could pri&s;matically &s;eparate. Bright &s;pots of effulgence al&s;o appeared; which could not well be denominated of any colour. Yet all, tho di&s;played in &s;uch rich profu&s;ion, were blended with &s;uch nice harmony; and tem|pered &s;o mode&s;tly by the grey mi&s;tine&s;s of di&s;tance; that gorgeous as the&s;e hues were, there was not a &s;ingle colour, that glared, or was out of place.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;For who can paint</L>
<L>Like nature? Can imagination boa&s;t,</L>
<L>Amid&s;t it's gay creation, hues like her's?</L>
<L>Or can it mix them with that matchle&s;s &s;kill</L>
<L>And lo&s;e them in each other?</L></Q>
<P>We had now made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in our voyage. The &s;ide-&s;creen on the left, kept &s;till the &s;ame di&s;tance; but the mountains in front, as we approached them, began now to &s;eparate into near, and di&s;tant grounds:
<PB N="148" REF="205">
and the rocks and woods, which, in the painter's language, <HI>adhered</HI> before; now <HI>broke away</HI> in a variety of projections; tho &s;till o'er&s;pread with &s;oft colouring, and tender &s;ha|dow.</P>
<P>As we approached nearer, this &s;oftne&s;s of colouring took a more vivid hue; and the pro|montories, and rocks continued &s;till projecting to the eye with new force of &s;hade: while the mountains, which ranged behind, began more and more to retire. The length of the lake, tho it affected the nearer grounds, made no change in the di&s;tant mountains: &s;o that the comparative di&s;tance between the fore-ground and them, was now much greater, than it had been.</P>
<P>An appearance of this kind is beautifully de&s;cribed by Virgil. When Aeneas came in &s;ight of Italy, he fir&s;t &s;aw a hazy appearance of hills, and low land;
<Q><L>&mdash;procul ob&s;curos colles, humilemque videmus</L>
<L>Italiam&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>On a nearer approach, he di&s;covered the temple of Minerva, which, being &s;eated on
<PB N="149" REF="206">
high ground, &s;eemed, as if it &s;tood on a pro|montory hanging over the &s;ea.</P>
<Q>&mdash;Templum apparet in arce Minervae.</Q>
<P>But as he came clo&s;e in with the land, the rocks took their proper form; and the temple retreated to a di&s;tance.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Gemino demittunt brachia muro</L>
<L>Turriti &s;copuli; refugitque a litore templum.</L></Q>
<P>As we approached the end of the lake, the promontories and rocks a&s;&s;umed new height; and almo&s;t hid the mountains, which continued to retire beyond them; while the form of the nearer grounds began al&s;o to vary. The water, which, a little before, &s;eemed in contact with the rocks, appeared now to wa&s;h a meadow; beyond which the rocks formed a fir&s;t di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The &s;cenery put us in mind of Berghem; who often cho&s;e a meadow, with a rock behind it, to relieve his cattle. His rock is generally left plain, and &s;imple, almo&s;t with|out a &s;ingle varying tint; a mere ma&s;s of tender &s;hadow: while the cattle are touched with infinite force and &s;pirit. We &s;aw the picture realized. Berghem's imagination could not

have formed a better back-ground, nor a more beautiful group. Such combinations are plea|&s;ing in life, in painting, and in poetry.</P>

<P>Through the meadow at the bottom of the rocky ground, two rivers, the Bratha, and the Rotha, wind their way; and uniting be|fore they meet the lake, enter it with a full, but quiet &s;tream; and furni&s;h it with large &s;upplies.</P>
<P>The Rotha takes it's ri&s;e from mountains about twelve miles di&s;tant; and forms the two lakes of Gra&s;mer, and Rydal, before it enter Windermere.</P>
<P>The Bratha ri&s;es from the pike of Langdale, in a mountainous, and rocky country; and
<PB N="151" REF="208">
after a turbulent cour&s;e, buries at length all it's inquietude in the peaceful waters of the lake, where it's name is no more remembred.</P>
<P>Our boatmen having conveyed us a con|&s;iderable way up the&s;e united &s;treams, landed us on the meadows, within half a mile of Amble&s;ide.</P>
<P>Before we leave this grand expan&s;e of water, I cannot forbear remarking a few circum|&s;tances, that relate to it.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place we admired it's extraordinary brightne&s;s. It is all over <HI>nitidis argenteus undis.</HI> The eye can &s;ee di&s;tinctly, in &s;mooth water, through a medium of at lea&s;t a dozen yards; and view the inhabitants of it's deep rece&s;&s;es, as they play in &s;hoals, and
<Q><L>&mdash;&s;porting with quick glance</L>
<L>Shew to the &s;un their waved coats dropt with gold.</L></Q></P>
<P>How far the tran&s;parency of water is an addition to <HI>a &s;cene,</HI> I cannot take upon me to &s;ay. Mo&s;t of the lakes in Scotland, which I &s;aw, are of a mo&s;&s;y-tinctured hue; and yet had their full effect in land&s;cape.&mdash;As a <HI>de|tached object</HI> however the tran&s;parent lake is
<PB N="152" REF="209">
incomparably the mo&s;t beautiful. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o, that the more brilliant the water is, the more brilliant are the reflections.</P>
<P>Among the great variety of fi&s;h, which inhabit the exten&s;ive waters of this lake, the <HI>char</HI> is the mo&s;t remarkable. It is near twice the &s;ize of a herring. It's back is of an olive-green: it's belly of a light vermilion; &s;often|ing in &s;ome parts into white; and changing into a deep red, at the in&s;ertion of the fins.</P>
<P>A parcel of char, ju&s;t caught and thrown together into the luggage-pool of a boat, makes a plea&s;ant harmony of colouring. The green olive-tint prevails; to which a &s;pirit is here and there given by a light blu&s;h of vermilion; and by a &s;trong touch of red, if a fin happen to appear. The&s;e plea&s;ing colours are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the bright &s;ilvery lights, which play over the whole; for nothing reflects light more beautifully than the &s;cales of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Char are caught only in the winter-&s;ea&s;on, when twenty dozen in a day, are &s;ometimes taken by a &s;ingle boat. In &s;ummer they re|tire to the rocky caves below, &s;ome of which are &s;aid to be unfathomable: nor do they breed
<PB N="153" REF="210">
in any lake, in which &s;uch deep rece&s;&s;es are not found.</P>
<P>The char-fi&s;hing is a very profitable branch of trade to the proprietors of the lake. The whole area of it is divided into five di&s;tricts. An invi&s;ible line cro&s;&s;es the &s;urface from crag to crag&mdash;a limit, which the fi&s;herman cor|rectly knows. But tho the &s;pace of each fi&s;hery is nearly equal, yet the produce is otherwi&s;e; the fi&s;h running in &s;hoals &s;ometimes in one part of the lake, and &s;ometimes in another.&mdash;When the farmer rents land, he can judge of his bargain by the &s;urface. When he rents water, he mu&s;t take his chance.</P>
<P>But fi&s;h are not the only inhabitants of this lake. Innumerable flights of water-fowl fre|quent it's exten&s;ive plain. The naturali&s;t may declare their names, and cla&s;&s;es: the painter has only to remark the variety of forms, in which they appear&mdash;&s;ometimes &s;itting in black groups upon the water, ri&s;ing and &s;inking with the waves: at other times in the air, circling the lake in figured files; or with he|&s;itating wing &s;eizing &s;ome &s;tation on it's banks, or &s;urface.&mdash;With regard to the&s;e minute ap|pendages
<PB N="154" REF="211">
of land&s;cape, let me only &s;ugge&s;t, that birds &s;hould never be introduced upon the wing, near the eye. Quick motion, of any kind, <HI>repre&s;ented,</HI> is an ab&s;urdity: and the longer you look, the more ab&s;urd it becomes. But at a little <HI>di&s;tance</HI> the motion of a bird appears &s;o &s;low, that the eye will <HI>endure</HI> a degree of improbability in the repre&s;entation of it.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that this magnificent piece of water &s;uffers little change, in <HI>appear|ance,</HI> from &s;ea&s;ons; but pre&s;erves the dignity of it's character under all circum&s;tances; &s;el|dom depre&s;&s;ed, and as &s;eldom rai&s;ed above it's ordinary level&mdash;Even in the mo&s;t violent rains, when the country is drenched in water, when every rill is &s;welled into a river; and the mountains pour down floods through new channels; the lake maintains the &s;ame equal temper; and tho it may &s;pread a few yards over it's lowe&s;t &s;hores (which is the utmo&s;t it does) yet it's increa&s;e is &s;eldom the object of ob&s;ervation: nor does the &s;everity of the greate&s;t drought make any con&s;iderable altera|tion in it's bounds. Once, (it is recorded,)
<PB N="155" REF="212">
it ro&s;e &s;even feet in perpendicular height. It's boundaries would then certainly <HI>appear</HI> in|larged; but this was a very uncommon ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But if it be not rai&s;ed by rains, it is often greatly agitated by winds. Of all the lakes of this country, none lies &s;o expo&s;ed, through the whole length of it, to &s;udden &s;qualls, as this: nor does any piece of fre&s;h water in the whole i&s;land perhaps emulate the grandeur of a di&s;turbed ocean &s;o much. It is of cour&s;e navigated with great caution, whenever there is a tendency to &s;tormy weather. Many acci|dents have &s;hewn the nece&s;&s;ity of this caution: but one made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on the country, as a century cannot efface. Several people in the neighbourhood of Bowne&s;s, having been attending a fair at Hawk&s;hed, a town on the other &s;ide of the lake, had embarked, in the evening, on their return home. But before this little voyage could be performed, &s;o vio|lent a &s;torm aro&s;e, that their boats foundered; and no fewer than forty-&s;even per&s;ons peri&s;hed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account is taken from Dr. Bourn's hi&s;t. of We&s;t|moreland.

<P>FROM Amble&s;ide we propo&s;ed to &s;et out for Ke&s;wick; being obliged, for want of time, to leave one &s;cene behind us, which we wi&s;hed much to vi&s;it&mdash;that of Furne&s;s-abbey. But the lo&s;s was in a great mea&s;ure made up, and our curio&s;ity &s;atisfied, by the accounts and drawings of Mr. John Smith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This arti&s;t has had a principal hand in etching the drawings which accompany the&s;e ob&s;ervations.</NOTE>, an ingenious young painter, who had been &s;tudying the ruins on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Furne&s;s-abbey lies about twenty miles from Amble&s;ide, beyond tho&s;e mountains, which range on the we&s;tern &s;ide of Windermere. It is &s;ituated in a beautiful valley, in the mid&s;t
<PB N="158" REF="215">
of a wide, open, cultivated country, which ri&s;es every where in large &s;wells; but is no where diver&s;ified by any objects of picture&s;que beauty. In &s;o inanimate a &s;cene we are &s;ur|prized to find a valley of &s;o different a &s;truc|ture; adorned with rock, and wood; through which winds a rapid &s;tream.</P>
<P>At the entrance of this &s;cene &s;tands the village of Dalton; from whence the valley, winding about four miles in one large, &s;weep|ing, narrow curve, opens on a rich view of Cartmel-bay.</P>
<P>About a mile within the valley, in the wide&s;t part, &s;tands the abbey. It &s;eems to have been con&s;tructed in a good &s;tyle of Gothic architecture; and has &s;uffered, from the hand of time, only &s;uch depredations, as picture&s;que beauty requires. The <HI>intire plan</HI> of the abbey-church, and a large <HI>fragment</HI> of it, &s;till re|main. The tower in the centre, which &s;eems never to have been lofty, is perforated with large arches. At the end of the we&s;tern aile &s;tand the ruins of a low, &s;imple tower, where the bells of the abbey are &s;uppo&s;ed to have hung: and from the &s;outh aile projects a building, which is called the chapter-hou&s;e. The cloy&s;ters are continued in the &s;ame di|rection;
<PB N="159" REF="216">
one wall of which, and all the in|ternal &s;tructure are gone. At the end of the cloy&s;ters ari&s;es a very rich and picture&s;que fragment, which is called the <HI>&s;chool.</HI></P>
<P>Round the whole runs an irregular wall, which cro&s;&s;ing the valley in two places, and mounting it's &s;ides, makes a circuit of about two miles. In many parts it is hid with trees, or &s;hrubs: in &s;ome parts, where it is di&s;covered, it is beautiful; and in very few, di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>In this wall are two gates, one to the north, and the other to the we&s;t; which &s;eem to have been the only outlets of the place. That to the north has been the great entrance: the other has more the appearance of a po&s;tern with a porter's lodge.</P>
<P>The proprietor of this noble &s;cene is lord George Cavendi&s;h, who is a faithful guardian of it, and, I am informed, takes care to pre|vent any further depredations.</P>
<P>From Amble&s;ide we &s;et out for Ke&s;wick, which is about eighteen miles farther north.</P>
<P>We were now about to enter the middle, and mo&s;t formidable part, of that va&s;t chain
<PB N="160" REF="217">
of mountains, which I have before men|tioned, as the barrier between Cumberland, and We&s;tmoreland; and which promi&s;ed, from a di&s;tant view, to pre&s;ent us with a great variety of very grand &s;cenery. Our morning's voyage on the &s;mooth expan&s;e of the lake aided our pre&s;ent expedition with all the powers of contra&s;t.</P>
<P>But before we enter the&s;e maje&s;tic &s;cenes, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e a di&s;tinction between a <HI>&s;cene of mountains,</HI> and a <HI>mountain &s;cene.</HI></P>
<P>Mountainous countries mo&s;t commonly pre|&s;ent only the former. The objects are grand; but they are huddled together, confu&s;ed, with|out connection; and the painter con&s;iders them only as <HI>&s;tudies;</HI> and forms them into pictures by <HI>imaginary combinations.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ometimes however &s;ee a mountainous country, in which nature it&s;elf hath made the&s;e beautiful combinations&mdash;where one part relates to another, and the effect of a whole is produced. This is what I call a <HI>mountain &s;cene.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="218" MS="y">Of this latter kind is almo&s;t the whole road between Amble&s;ide, and Ke&s;wick. The mountains are <HI>naturally</HI> combined into &s;cenes; which if not, in all parts, purely picture&s;que; are, in all parts, marked with the great lines of compo&s;ition; tho often on too wide a &s;cale for imitation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object of our attention, on leaving Amble&s;ide, was Rydal-hall, the &s;eat of Sir Michael le Fleming. It &s;tands on a ri&s;ing lawn. On the north and ea&s;t it is &s;heltered by lofty mountains. In front, towards the &s;outh, it commands a noble di&s;tance, con&s;i&s;t|ing of the exten&s;ive vale of Windermere, bound|ed by the lake. The mountain, on the north, called Rydal-cragg, ri&s;ing clo&s;e behind the hou&s;e, is high and rocky. That on the ea&s;t, is of inferior &s;ize, but is covered with wood. Between the&s;e mountains runs a narrow, wood|ed valley; through which a con&s;iderable &s;tream, falling down a quick de&s;cent, along a rocky channel, forms a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ca&s;cades.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e, tho but a miniature, is &s;o beautiful both in it&s;elf, and in it's accompani|ments, as to de&s;erve particular notice.&mdash;It is
<PB N="162" REF="219">
&s;een from a &s;ummer-hou&s;e; before which it's rocky cheeks circling on each &s;ide form a little area; appearing through the window like a picture in a frame. The water falls within a few yards of the eye, which being rather above it's level, has a long per&s;pective view of the &s;tream, as it hurries from the higher grounds; tumbling, in various, little breaks, through it's rocky channel, darkened with thicket, till it arrive at the edge of the precipice, before the window; from whence it ru&s;hes into the ba&s;on, which is formed by nature in the native rock. The dark colour of the &s;tone, taking &s;till a deeper tinge from the wood, which hangs over it, &s;ets off to wonderful advantage the &s;parkling lu&s;tre of the &s;tream; and produces an uncommon effect of light. It is this effect indeed, from which the chief beauty of the &s;cene ari&s;es. In every repre&s;entation, truly picture&s;que, the &s;hade &s;hould greatly overbalance the light. The face of nature, under the glow of noon, has rarely this beautiful appearance. The arti&s;t therefore generally courts her charms in a morning, or an evening hour, when the &s;ha|dows are deep, and extended; and when the &s;loping &s;un-beam affords rather a catching,
<PB REF="220">

<PB N="163" REF="221">
than a glaring light. In this little exhibition we had an admirable idea of the magical effect of light picture&s;quely di&s;tributed.</P>
<P>On leaving Rydal, we entered a va&s;t cha&s;m between two mountains, which may properly be called a portal to the &s;cenes we approached.</P>
<P>On pa&s;&s;ing it, we were pre&s;ented with a grand <HI>&s;cene of mountains;</HI> adorned by a lake, called Rydal-water, on the left; not indeed adequate to the greatne&s;s of the &s;urrounding objects; but of &s;uch beauty, as immediately to fix the eye. In the mid&s;t of it is a rocky i&s;land, covered with wood. The little river Rotha, winding round a promontory, enters it on the north.</P>
<P>Leaving the&s;e &s;cenes, we a&s;cended a very &s;teep hill; from the &s;ummit of which was di&s;played a pro&s;pect of de&s;olation in a very dignified form. It was an amphitheatre of craggy mountains, which appeared to &s;weep round a circumference of at lea&s;t thirty miles; tho in fact, perhaps it did not include half that &s;pace. But great objects naturally form a
<PB N="164" REF="222">
wide &s;cale of men&s;uration.&mdash;The &s;oul involun|tarily &s;huddered at the fir&s;t a&s;pect of &s;uch a &s;cene.&mdash;At the di&s;tant part of it lay Gra&s;mer-lake; which being &s;o far removed from the eye, &s;eemed only a bright &s;pot at the bottom of the mountains.</P>
<P>To this lake the road directly led. A nearer approach pre&s;ented us with &s;ome beautiful views on it's banks; tho, on the whole, it's principal merit con&s;i&s;ted in refre&s;hing the eye with a &s;mooth expan&s;e of water, in the mid&s;t of &s;uch a variety of rough mountain-&s;cenery. As we &s;kirted it's limits, it &s;eemed larger, than that of Rydal; and tho it appeared like a &s;pot at a di&s;tance, became now the principal feature of this va&s;t vale.</P>
<P>From hence the road led us into another amphitheatre, wild, and immen&s;e like the former; but varied greatly in the &s;hapes of the mountains; which were here more broken and irregular; &s;hooting, in many places, into craggy &s;ummits, and broken points.</P>
<P>And yet even the&s;e wild &s;cenes, covered, as they are, with craggs, and &s;carce furni&s;hing the lea&s;t tint of vegetation, are &s;ubject to rights,
<PB N="165" REF="223">
for which none but the hard inhabitant would think it worth his while to contend. You &s;ee every where their bare, and barren &s;ides marked with partition-walls&mdash;&s;tones with|out morter, laid upon each other, cro&s;&s;ing at right angles; and running down &s;teeps, and along precipices, where the eye can &s;carce conceive they could have any foundation. All the&s;e <HI>partitions of de&s;olation,</HI> as they may be called, have their inhabitants; each maintain|ing a few &s;tunted &s;heep, which picking the meagre tufts of gra&s;s, which grow under the &s;heltered &s;ides of craggs, and &s;tones, earn, like their owners, a hard &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of this immen&s;e amphi|theatre, into which we la&s;t entered, we found an exit, equal to the &s;cene&mdash;another grand mountain-gap, or portal, through which the road carried us up another &s;teep mountain&mdash; At the top we pau&s;ed, and looking back on the &s;cenes we had left, were pre&s;ented with a view, which wholly filled the imagination.</P>
<P>It was a <HI>retro&s;pect</HI> of the amphitheatre we had pa&s;&s;ed; but in a &s;tyle &s;till grander, than the pro&s;pect of it. It was more &s;trongly marked with the great out-lines of compo&s;i|tion; and was, of cour&s;e, more a whole.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="224">A wide vale, thrown by per&s;pective into a circular form, lay before the eye. Here al&s;o the di&s;tant part &s;eemed occupied by the lake of Gra&s;mer; but a greyi&s;h mi&s;t left the idea ambiguous. Beyond the lake aro&s;e various mountains, which bounded it: and &s;till beyond the&s;e, appeared the blue heads of other moun|tains. Tho&s;e, which formed the &s;ide-&s;creens of the vale, advancing forward from the di&s;tant mountains beyond the lake, approached the eye in a grand &s;weep, by the ea&s;y gradations of per&s;pective. The promontories, and re|ce&s;&s;es, of the more removed parts were mark|ed by a faint &s;hadow; till by degrees both the &s;ide-&s;creens, growing boldly on the eye, were lo&s;t behind the two cheeks of the craggy por|tal, which, with the road between them, formed a fore-ground equal to the &s;cene. The whole view is entirely of the horrid kind. Not a tree appeared to add the lea&s;t chearful|ne&s;s to it.</P>
<P>With regard to the adorning of &s;uch a &s;cene with figures, nothing could &s;uit it better than a group of banditti. Of all the &s;cenes I ever &s;aw, this was the mo&s;t adapted to the per|petration of &s;ome dreadful deed. The imagi|nation can hardly avoid conceiving a band of robbers lurking under the &s;helter of &s;ome pro|jecting
<PB N="167" REF="225">
rock; and expecting the traveller, as he approaches along the valley below.</P>
<P>Nothing however of this kind was ever heard of in the country. The depredations of foxes, are the only depredations, to which the cottages in the&s;e vallies are expo&s;ed. Our po&s;tilion pointed to a rugged part on the &s;um|mit of a rocky mountain on the left, which, he told us, was the great harbour of the&s;e animals. Here they bred; from hence they infe&s;ted the country; and to this inacce&s;&s;ible a&s;ylum they retreated in the hour of alarm.</P>
<P>After we left the two amphitheatres, ju&s;t de&s;cribed, we met with nothing very intere&s;t|ing, till we came to the celebrated pa&s;s, known by the name of <HI>Dunmail-Rai&s;e,</HI> which divides the counties of Cumberland, and We&s;t|moreland.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this rude monument, which con&s;i&s;ts of a mon&s;trous pile of &s;tones, heaped on each &s;ide of an earthen mound, is little known. It was probably intended to mark a divi&s;ion, not between tho&s;e two northern counties; but rather between the two king|doms of England, and Scotland, in elder times, when the Scotti&s;h border extended
<PB N="168" REF="226">
beyond it's pre&s;ent bounds. And indeed this chain of mountains &s;eems to be a much more na|tural divi&s;ion of the two kingdoms, in this part, than a little river in a champaign country, like the E&s;k, which now divides them. It is &s;aid, this divi&s;ion was made by a Saxon prince, on the death of Dunmail the la&s;t king of Cum|berland, who was here &s;lain in battle.&mdash;But for whatever purpo&s;e this rude pile was fabri|cated, it hath yet &s;uffered little change in it's dimen&s;ions; and is one of tho&s;e monuments of antiquity, which may be characterized by the &s;criptural phra&s;e of <HI>remaining to this very day.</HI></P>
<P>The entrance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are three pa&s;&s;ages, over this chain of mountains, into Cumberland. This by <HI>Amble&s;ide,</HI> is the wilde&s;t, and mo&s;t picture&s;que. A &s;econd by <HI>Brough</HI> over Stainmore, is dreary, rather than wild: and a third by <HI>Shap,</HI> is both.</NOTE> into Cumberland pre&s;ents us with a &s;cene very &s;trongly marked with the &s;ublime; grander, tho le&s;s picture&s;que, than the amphitheatre we had pa&s;&s;ed. It is a vi&s;ta of mountains pur&s;uing each other, if I may &s;o phra&s;e it, through an ea&s;y de&s;cent
<PB N="169" REF="227">
of not le&s;s than &s;ix, or &s;even miles; and clo&s;ed at the di&s;tant end by Wyburn-lake, a con&s;i|derable piece of water.</P>
<P>This &s;cene is great in all it's parts; and in it's general compo&s;ition. The mountains, of which the &s;ide-&s;creens of this vi&s;ta are formed, fall generally in ea&s;y lines, and range at the di&s;tance of a mile and a half, or two miles, from each other. But it is difficult to a&s;certain a di&s;tance of this kind: for as the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ntain ri&s;es <HI>gradually</HI> from it's ba&s;e, we c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">not ea&s;ily fix where it begins. It is enough to ob&s;erve, that through the whole immen&s;ity of the view before us there appeared no di&s;|proportion.</P>
<P>Among the mountains, which compo&s;e this magnificent &s;cene, there is one on the right, of &s;uperior grandeur; &s;tretching, near a league and a half, in one va&s;t concave ridge. This mountain is known by the name of <HI>Helvellin;</HI> with which three mountains only, through this va&s;t region, di&s;pute the point of altitude&mdash; Cro&s;s-fell&mdash;Gra&s;mer&mdash;and Skiddaw. The in|habitants of it's invirons give it univer&s;ally for Helvellin: but, I believe, it is no where el&s;e treated with &s;uch re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="228" MS="y">Be&s;ides the general grandeur of this view, there is a wonderful variety in the &s;hapes of the &s;everal mountains, which compo&s;e it. Na|ture's vi&s;tas are never formed by rule, and compa&s;s. Whenever &s;he deviates towards a re|gular &s;hape, &s;he does it with that negligent air of greatne&s;s, which marks &s;ublimity of genius. No attention to trifles characterizes her &s;cenes. Her very regularities di&s;cover tho&s;e &s;trong touches of contra&s;t, that range of imagination, which de&s;troys every idea of &s;amene&s;s.</P>
<P>Of all the rude &s;cenery we had yet vi&s;ited, none equalled this in <HI>de&s;olation.</HI> The whole is one immen&s;ity of barrenne&s;s. The moun|tains are univer&s;ally over&s;pread with craggs, and &s;tones, which are &s;ometimes &s;cattered carele&s;sly over their &s;urfaces; and &s;ometimes appear &s;hivering in ca&s;cades of crumbling frag|ments down their &s;ides. Helvellin, through all it's &s;pace, is one intire pavement. Nor is the view disfigured by the abundance of this more ordinary &s;pecies of rock<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 108.</NOTE>. In it's va&s;tne&s;s the parts coale&s;ce; and become a
<PB N="171" REF="229">
whole.&mdash;The fractured rock, &s;o beautiful in it&s;elf, is calculated rather for &s;maller pictures. Here it would be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e va&s;t regions, who&s;e parts are thus ab&s;orbed in the immen&s;ity of a whole, have the &s;tronge&s;t effect on the imagination. They di&s;tend the mind, and fix it in a kind of &s;tupor:
<Q><L>&mdash;the&s;e lonely regions, where retired</L>
<L>From little &s;cenes of art, great Nature dwells</L>
<L>In awful &s;olitude&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>We now approached the lake of Wyburn, or Thirlmer, as it is &s;ometimes called; an object every way &s;uited to the ideas of de&s;ola|tion, which &s;urround it. No tufted verdure graces it's banks, nor hanging woods throw rich reflections on it's &s;urface: but every form, which it &s;ugge&s;ts, is &s;avage, and de&s;olate. It is about two miles in length, and half as much in breadth, &s;urrounded by barren mountains, and precipices, &s;helving into it in all direc|tions:
<Q><L>&mdash;A joyle&s;s coa&s;t</L>
<L>Around a &s;tormy lake&mdash;</L></Q>
<PB N="172" REF="230">
And to impre&s;s &s;till more the characteri&s;tic idea of the place, the road hanging over it, ran along the edge of a precipice.&mdash;One pecu|liar feature al&s;o belongs to it. About the middle of the lake, the &s;hores, on each &s;ide, nearly uniting, are joined by an Alpine bridge. I did not ob&s;erve any picture&s;que beauty ari|&s;ing from this circum&s;tance: but rather a formality; at lea&s;t from the &s;tand, where I viewed it. A communication however of this kind rather increa&s;es the romantic idea.</P>
<P>Beyond Wyburn-lake we deviated into a mere <HI>&s;cene of mountains.</HI> Nature &s;eemed to have aimed at &s;ome mode of compo&s;ition, which &s;he had left unfini&s;hed; but it was difficult to conceive, what &s;pecies of land&s;cape &s;he meant; a <HI>valley,</HI> or a <HI>woody rece&s;s;</HI> a <HI>barren &s;cene,</HI> or a <HI>cultivated one.</HI> There was a mix|ture of all.</P>
<P>This mi&s;cellaneous pa&s;&s;age however did not continue long. It appeared only a &s;hort inter|ruption of the grand vi&s;ta, from which we had deviated at the lake of Wyburn; and into which we now returned. Nature however &s;eemed to have &s;pent her force in her fir&s;t
<PB N="173" REF="231">
effort; which was greatly &s;uperior to the &s;econd.</P>
<P>The thickets among the&s;e mountains, and indeed many other parts of the country, are frequented by the wild-cat; which Mr. Pen|nant calls the Briti&s;h tyger; and &s;ays, it is the fierce&s;t, and mo&s;t de&s;tructive bea&s;t we have. He &s;peaks of it as being three or four times as large as the common cat. We &s;aw one dead, which had been hunted on the day we &s;aw it; and it &s;eemed very little inferior, if at all, to the &s;ize he mentions.</P>
<P>By this time we approached Ke&s;wick; and from the de&s;cent of Ca&s;tle-hill, at about two miles di&s;tance, had an exten&s;ive view of the whole country around that celebrated &s;cene of romantic beauty.</P>
<P>Before us lay a plain many leagues in circum|ference, divided into two large portions; each of which is floated by a lake. <HI>Derwent-water</HI> over&s;preads the nearer; and <HI>Ba&s;&s;enthwait,</HI> the more di&s;tant. Surrounding the whole, ri&s;es a va&s;t, circular chain of mountains; and tow|ering
<PB N="174" REF="232">
over them all, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the i&s;thmus, &s;tands the mountain of Skiddaw. We had heard too much of this mountain, to meet it properly: it has none of tho&s;e bold projections, and &s;haggy maje&s;ty about it, which we expected to have &s;een in this king of mountains. It is a tame, inanimate object; except at &s;uch a di&s;tance, as &s;mooths the imbo&s;&s;ed work of all the&s;e rich fabrics; and where it's double top makes it a di&s;tingui&s;hed object to mark, and characterize a &s;cene.&mdash; But if the mountain di&s;appointed us; the &s;cene, over which it pre&s;ided, went beyond our imagination.</P>
<P>This rich, exten&s;ive view was aided, when we &s;aw it, by all the powers (or, more pro|perly, the re&s;plendency) of light and &s;hade. The morning had been fine: but in the after|noon the clouds began to gather, threatening rain. A heavy &s;ky over&s;pread the higher, and middle regions of the air with all the &s;o|lemnity of gloom; dropping it's dark mantle to the &s;kirts of the horizon. Ju&s;t as we arrived at the brow of the hill, with the &s;cenery of the two lakes, and their accompani|ments before us, the &s;etting &s;un bur&s;t forth in a glow of &s;plendor.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="233">If a <HI>common</HI> &s;un-&s;et often gives a beautiful appearance even to an <HI>ordinary</HI> land&s;cape; what mu&s;t have been the effect of an <HI>uncommon</HI> one, on <HI>&s;uch</HI> a land&s;cape as this&mdash;a &s;un-&s;et not merely a <HI>flood of &s;plendor,</HI> but contra&s;ted by the fulle&s;t depth of &s;hade? Here we had the beauties of the little &s;ummer-hou&s;e &s;cene, on the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;cale. The effect was a&s;toni&s;hing. The whole was a &s;cene of glory&mdash; but a &s;cene of glory painted by the hand of nature. Tho every part glowed with tran|&s;cendent lu&s;tre; the whole was in nice&s;t har|mony. But it was a tran&s;itory vi&s;ion. While we gazed; it faded: and in a few moments nothing was left, but the great outlines&mdash;the grand compo&s;ition of the &s;cene. We &s;hould have &s;tood over it even thus, in rapture; if we had not ju&s;t &s;een what a &s;plendid addition it was capable of receiving.</P>

Ke&s;wick &s;tands at the north-point of Derwent-water; which is the very point, that Amble&s;ide occupies on Windermere. But the &s;ituation of Amble&s;ide is more romantic, as it &s;tands more in the middle of that chain of mountains, which &s;eparates the two counties. At Ke&s;wick the roughne&s;&s;es of the country are wearing off: for in a few miles beyond it, this great barrier ends.</P>

<P>ON the 9th of June we &s;et out on <HI>hor&s;e|back</HI> (which I mention, as it is the only conveyance the road will admit) on an expe|dition into Borrodale; a wild country &s;outh|we&s;t of Ke&s;wick. Our road led along the lake of <HI>Derwent,</HI> which was the fir&s;t object we &s;urveyed.</P>
<P>But before we examined the particulars of this grand &s;cene, we took a general view of the whole, from it's northern &s;hore; which is the only part unblockaded by mountains. This is the i&s;thmian part, which joins the valley of Derwent-water with that of Ba&s;&s;en|thwait. It was ea&s;y from the higher grounds of this i&s;thmus to obtain the &s;tation we de&s;ired.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="238">The <HI>lake of Derwent,</HI> or <HI>Ke&s;wick-lake,</HI> as it is generally called, is contained within a circumference of about ten miles; pre&s;enting it&s;elf in a circular form, tho in fact it is rather oblong. It's area is inter&s;per&s;ed with four or five i&s;lands: three of which only are of con|&s;equence, <HI>Lord's i&s;land, Vicar's i&s;land,</HI> and <HI>St. Herbert's i&s;land:</HI> but none of them is com|parable to the i&s;land on Windermere, in point either of &s;ize, or beauty.</P>
<P>If a painter were de&s;irous of &s;tudying the whole circumference of the lake from one &s;tation, St. Herbert's i&s;land is the &s;pot he &s;hould choo&s;e; from whence, as from a centre, he might &s;ee it in rotation. I have &s;een a &s;et of drawings taken from this &s;tand; which were hung round a circular room, and intended to give a general idea of the boundaries of the lake. But as no repre&s;entation could be given of the lake it&s;elf; the idea was lo&s;t, and the drawings made but an awkward appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="239">Lord's i&s;land had it's name from being the place, where once &s;tood a plea&s;ure-hou&s;e, be|longing to the unfortunate family of Derwent-water, which took it's title from this lake. The ancient manor-hou&s;e &s;tood on Ca&s;tle-hill above Ke&s;wick; where the antiquarian traces al&s;o the ve&s;tiges of a Roman fort. But an heire&s;s of Derwent-water marrying into the family of the Ratcliffs; the family-&s;eat was removed from Ke&s;wick to Dil&s;ton in Nor|thumberland.</P>
<P>As the boundaries of this lake are more mountainous than tho&s;e of Windermere; they, of cour&s;e, afford more <HI>romantic &s;cenery.</HI> But tho the whole &s;hore, except the &s;pot where we &s;tood, is incircled with mountains; they rarely fall abruptly into the water; which is girt almo&s;t round by a margin of meadow&mdash;on the we&s;tern &s;hores e&s;pecially. On the ea&s;tern, the mountains approach nearer the water; and in &s;ome parts fall perpendicularly into it. But as we &s;tood viewing the lake from it's northern &s;hores, all the&s;e marginal parts were lo&s;t; and
<PB N="182" REF="240">
the mountains (tho in fact they de&s;cribe a circle of twenty miles, which is double the circumference of the lake) appeared univer|&s;ally to ri&s;e from the water's edge.</P>
<P>Along it's we&s;tern &s;hores on the right, they ri&s;e &s;mooth and uniform; and are therefore rather lumpi&s;h. The more removed part of this mountain-line is elegant: but, in &s;ome parts, it is di&s;agreeably broken.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;tern &s;ide, the mountains are both grander, and more picture&s;que. The line is plea&s;ing; and is filled with that variety of objects, broken-ground,&mdash;rocks,&mdash;and wood, which being well combined, take from the heavine&s;s of a mountain; and give it an airy lightne&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>front</HI>-&s;creen, (if we may &s;o call a por|tion of a circular form,) is more formidable, than either of the &s;ides. But it's line is le&s;s elegant, than that of the ea&s;tern-&s;creen. The fall of Lodoar, which adorns that part of the lake, is an object of no con&s;equence at the di&s;tance we now &s;tood. But in our intended ride we propo&s;ed to take a nearer view of it.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="241" MS="y">Of all the lakes in the&s;e romantic regions, the lake we are now examining, &s;eems to be mo&s;t generally admired. It was once admira|bly characterized by an ingenious per&s;on,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Mr. Avi&s;on, organi&s;t of St. Nicolas at New-ca&s;tle upon Tyne.</NOTE> who, on his fir&s;t &s;eeing it, cryed out, <HI>Here is beauty indeed&mdash;Beauty lying in the lap of Horrour!</HI> We do not often find a happier illu&s;tration. Nothing conveys an idea of <HI>beauty</HI> more &s;trongly, than the lake; nor of <HI>horrour,</HI> than the mountains; and the former <HI>lying in the lap</HI> of the latter, expre&s;&s;es in a &s;trong man|ner the mode of their combination. The late Dr. Brown, who was a man of ta&s;te, and had &s;een every part of this country, &s;ingled out the &s;cenery of this lake for it's peculiar beauty<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In a letter to Lord Lyttelton, quoted above.</NOTE>. And unque&s;tionably it is, in many places, very &s;weetly romantic; particularly along it's ea&s;tern, and &s;outhern &s;hores: but to give it <HI>pre-eminence</HI> may be paying it perhaps as much too high a compliment; as it would be too
<PB N="184" REF="242">
rigorous to make any but a few comparative objections.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it's form, which in ap|pearance is circular, is le&s;s intere&s;ting, I think, than the winding &s;weep of Windermere, and &s;ome other lakes; which lo&s;ing them&s;elves in va&s;t reaches, behind &s;ome cape or promontory, add to their other beauties the varieties of di&s;tance, and per&s;pective. Some people object to this, as touching rather on the character of the river. But does that injure it's beauty? And yet I believe there are very few rivers, which form &s;uch reaches, as the lake of Win|dermere.</P>
<P>To the formality of it's &s;hores may be added the formality of it's i&s;lands. They are round, regular, and &s;imilar &s;pots, as they appear from mo&s;t points of view; formal in their &s;ituation, as well as in their &s;hape; and of little advan|tage to the &s;cene. The i&s;lands of Windermere are in them&s;elves better &s;haped; more varied; and uniting together, add a beauty, and con|tra&s;t to the whole.</P>
<P>But among the greate&s;t objections to this lake is the abrupt, and broken line in &s;everal of the mountains, which compo&s;e it's &s;creens, (e&s;pecially on the we&s;tern, and on part of
<PB N="185" REF="243">
the &s;outhern &s;hore) which is more remarkable, than on any of the other lakes. We have little of the ea&s;y &s;weep of a mountain-line: at lea&s;t the eye is hurt with too many tops of mountains, which injure the ideas of &s;im|plicity, and grandeur. Great care therefore &s;hould be taken in &s;electing views of this lake. If there is a littlene&s;s even amid&s;t the grand ideas of the original, what can we expect from repre&s;entations on paper, or canvas? I have &s;een &s;ome views of this lake, injudiciou&s;ly cho&s;en, or taken on too exten&s;ive a &s;cale, in which the mountains appear like hay-cocks.&mdash; I would be under&s;tood however to &s;peak chiefly of the appearance, which the lines of the&s;e mountains <HI>occa&s;ionally</HI> make. When we change our point of view, the mountain-line changes al&s;o, and may be beautiful in one point, tho it is di&s;plea&s;ing in another.</P>
<P>Having thus taken a view of the <HI>whole lake together</HI> from it's northern point, we pro|ceeded on our rout to Borrodale, &s;kirting the ea&s;tern coa&s;t along the edge of the water. The grand &s;ide-&s;creen, on the left, hung over us; and we found it as beautifully romantic,
<PB N="186" REF="244">
and plea&s;ing to the imagination, when it's rocks, precipices, and woods became a fore-ground; as it appeared from the northern point of the lake, when we examined it in a more removed point of view.</P>
<P>Nor do the&s;e rocky &s;hores recommend them&s;elves to us only as fore-grounds. We found them every where the happie&s;t &s;tations for obtaining the mo&s;t picture&s;que views of the lake. The inexperienced conductor, &s;hewing you the lake, carries you to &s;ome gari&s;h &s;tand, where the eye may range far and wide. And &s;uch a view indeed is well cal|culated, as we have ju&s;t &s;een, to obtain a general idea of the whole. But he, who is in que&s;t of the picture&s;que &s;cenes of the lake, mu&s;t travel along the rough &s;ide-&s;creens that adorn it; and catch it's beauties, as they ari&s;e in &s;maller portions&mdash;it's little bays, and winding &s;hores&mdash;it's deep rece&s;&s;es, and hang|ing promontories&mdash;it's garni&s;hed rock, and di&s;|tant mountain. The&s;e are, in general, the picture&s;que &s;cenes, which it affords.</P>
<P>Part of this mountain is known by the name of Lady's-rake, from a tradition, that a young lady of the Derwentwater family, in the time of &s;ome public di&s;turbance, e&s;caped a pur&s;uit

<P>Detached from this <HI>continent</HI> of precipice, if I may &s;o &s;peak, &s;tands a rocky hill, known by the name of <HI>Ca&s;tellet.</HI> Under the beetling brow of this natural ruin we pa&s;&s;ed; and as we viewed it upwards from it's ba&s;e, it &s;eemed a fabric of &s;uch grandeur, that alone it was &s;uffi|cient to give dignity to any &s;cene. We were de&s;ired to take particular notice of it for a rea&s;on, which &s;hall afterwards be mentioned.</P>
<P>As we proceeded in our rout along the lake, the road grew wilder, and more roman|tic. There is not an idea more tremendous, than that of riding along the edge of a preci|pice, unguarded by any parapet, under im|pending rocks, which threaten above; while the &s;urges of a flood, or the whirlpools of a rapid river, terrify below.</P>
<P>Many &s;uch roads there are in various parts of the world; particularly among the moun|tains of Norway and Sweden; where they are
<PB N="188" REF="247">
carried along precipices of &s;uch frightful height, that the trees at the bottom a&s;&s;ume the azure tint of di&s;tance; and the cataracts which roar among them, cannot even be heard, unle&s;s the air be perfectly &s;till. The&s;e tremendous roads are often not only without rail, or parapet of any kind; but &s;o narrow, that travellers in oppo&s;ite directions cannot pa&s;s, unle&s;s one of them draw him&s;elf up clo&s;e to the rock. In &s;ome places, where the precipice does not afford footing even for this narrow &s;helf; or, where it may have foundered, a cleft pine is thrown acro&s;s the cha&s;m. The appalled traveller arriving at the &s;pot, &s;urveys it with di&s;may.&mdash;Return, he dare not&mdash;for he knows what a variety of terrors he has already pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;Yet if his foot &s;lip, or the plank, on which he re&s;ts, give way; he will find his death, and his grave together; and never more be heard of.</P>
<P>But here we had not even the miniature of the&s;e dreadful ideas, at lea&s;t on the &s;ide of the lake: for in the &s;teepe&s;t part, we were &s;carce rai&s;ed thirty or forty feet above the water.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="248">As we edged the precipices, we every where &s;aw fragments of rock, and large &s;tones &s;cattered about, which being loo&s;ened by fro&s;ts and rains, had fallen from the cliffs above; and &s;hew the traveller what dangers he has e&s;caped.</P>
<P>Once we found our&s;elves in hands more capricious than the elements. We rode along the edge of a precipice, under a &s;teep woody rock; when &s;ome large &s;tones came rolling from the top, and ru&s;hing through the thickets above us, bounded acro&s;s the road, and plunged into the lake. At that in&s;tant we had made a pau&s;e to ob&s;erve &s;ome part of the &s;cenery; and by half a dozen yards e&s;caped mi&s;chief. The wind was loud, and we conceived the &s;tones had been di&s;lodged by it's violence: but on riding a little further, we di&s;covered the real cau&s;e. High above our heads, at the &s;ummit of the cliff, &s;at a group of mountain|eer children, amu&s;ing them&s;elves with pu&s;hing &s;tones from the top; and watching, as they plunged into the lake.&mdash;Of us they knew nothing, who were &s;creened from them by intervening thickets.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="249">As we approached the head of the lake, we were de&s;ired to turn round, and take a view of Ca&s;tellet, that rocky hill, which had appeared &s;o enormous, as we &s;tood under it. It had now &s;hrunk into nothing in the mid&s;t of that &s;cene of greatne&s;s, which &s;urrounded it. I mention this circum&s;tance, as in the&s;e wild countries, compari&s;on is the only &s;cale u&s;ed in the men&s;uration of mountains. At lea&s;t it was the only &s;cale, to which we were ever referred. In countries graced by a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> mountain, the inhabitants may be very accurate in their inve&s;tigation of it's height. The altitude and circumference of the <HI>Wrekin,</HI> I have no doubt, is accurately known in Shrop&s;hire; but in a country like this, where chain is linked to chain, exactne&s;s would be endle&s;s.</P>
<P>By this time we approached the head of the lake; and could now di&s;tingui&s;h the full &s;ound of the fall of Lodoar; which had be|fore reached our ears, as the wind &s;uffered, indi&s;tinctly in broken notes.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="250">This water-fall is a noble object, both in it&s;elf, and as an ornament of the lake. It appears more as an object <HI>connected with the lake,</HI> as we approach by water. By land, we &s;ee it over a promontory of low ground, which, in &s;ome degree, hides it's grandeur. At the di&s;tance of a mile, it begins to appear with dignity.</P>
<P>But of whatever advantage the fall of Lodoar may be as a piece of <HI>di&s;tant</HI> &s;cenery, it's effect is very noble, when examined <HI>on the &s;pot.</HI> As a &s;ingle object, it wants no accompaniments of off&s;kip; which would rather injure, than a&s;&s;i&s;t it. They would di&s;turb it's &s;implicity, and repo&s;e. The greatne&s;s of it's parts affords &s;cenery enough. Some in&s;truments plea&s;e in concert: others you wi&s;h to hear alone.</P>
<P>The &s;tream falls through a cha&s;m between two towering perpendicular rocks. The in|termediate part, broken into large fragments, forms the rough bed of the ca&s;cade. Some of the&s;e fragments &s;tretching out in &s;helves, hold a depth of &s;oil &s;ufficient for large trees. Among the&s;e broken rocks the &s;tream finds it's way through a fall of at lea&s;t an hundred feet; and in heavy rains, the water is every way &s;uited to the grandeur of the &s;cene. Rocks and
<PB N="192" REF="251">
water in oppo&s;ition can hardly produce a more animated &s;trife. The ground at the bottom al&s;o is very much broken, and over-grown with trees, and thickets; among&s;t which the water is &s;wallowed up into an aby&s;s; and at length finds it's way, through deep channels, into the lake. We di&s;mounted, and got as near as we could: but were not able to approach &s;o near, as to look into the woody cha&s;m, which receives the fall.</P>
<P>Having viewed this grand piece of natural ruin, we proceeded in our rout towards the mountains of Borrodale; and &s;haping our cour&s;e along the &s;outhern &s;hores of the lake, we came to the river Derwent, which is a little to the we&s;t of the Lodoar.</P>
<P>The&s;e two rivers, the Lodoar, and the Derwent, furni&s;h the chief &s;upplies of Der|wentwater. But tho&s;e of the latter are much ampler. The Lodoar accordingly is lo&s;t in the lake: while the Derwent, fir&s;t giving it's name to it, retains it's own to the &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB REF="252"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="253">On pa&s;&s;ing this river, and turning the fir&s;t great promontory on our left, we found our&s;elves in a va&s;t rece&s;s of mountains. We had &s;een them at a di&s;tance, from the northern extremity of the lake. They were then objects of grandeur. But now they had a&s;&s;umed their full maje&s;tic form; &s;urrounding us on every &s;ide with their lofty barriers; and &s;hutting out, in appearance, every idea of an e&s;cape. Wild and various beyond conception were their &s;hapes: but they parti|cipated rather of the de&s;olate, than of the fan|ta&s;tic idea. From the bottom of the lake in|deed they formed too great a combination of pointed &s;ummits. But here all the&s;e grote&s;que &s;hapes di&s;appeared. The &s;ummits receded far behind; and we only &s;aw the bur&s;ting rocks, and bold protuberances, with which the &s;ides of the&s;e enormous ma&s;&s;es of &s;olid earth are charged. Many of them are covered, like the &s;teeps of Helvellin, with a continued pave|ment of craggs.</P>
<P>The winding of the Derwent was the clue we followed in our pa&s;&s;age through the&s;e re|gions of de&s;olation. An aperture between the
<PB N="194" REF="254">
mountains brought us into another wild rece&s;s, where a &s;imilar &s;cene opened; diver&s;ified from the fir&s;t only by &s;ome new forms, or new po&s;ition, or varied furniture, of the incumbent mountains.</P>
<P>As we doubled one promontory, another unfolded; and we found our&s;elves, not in, what appeared at fir&s;t, a rece&s;s of mountains; but in a narrow, winding valley; the &s;cenes of which, by quick tran&s;itions, were conti|nually &s;hifting. This valley &s;o replete with hideous grandeur, is known by the name of the &s;traits of Borrodale.</P>
<P>In the middle of one of the rece&s;&s;es of the valley lies an enormous &s;tone; which is called in the country <HI>Boother-&s;tone.</HI> Ma&s;&s;y rocks of immen&s;e &s;ize, rent from mountains, are every where found: but this &s;tone appears to be of a different kind. It does not &s;eem to have been the appendage of a mountain; but it|&s;elf an independent creation. It lies in a &s;ort of diagonal po&s;ition; over&s;hadowing a &s;pace, &s;ufficient to &s;helter a troop of hor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="255">Not far from hence ari&s;es a woody hill, called <HI>Ca&s;tell-cragg;</HI> which is al&s;o detached from the &s;cenery around it. On the &s;ummit of this hill, &s;tood formerly a fortre&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ed to be of Roman origin; intended to guard this avenue into the country. After it had been relinqui&s;hed by the Romans, it was oc|cupied by the Saxons; and, after their day, it was given, with all the lands about Borro|dale, by one of the lords of Derwent-water, to the monks of Furne&s;s. By the&s;e religious it was &s;till maintained in it's military capacity; which is perhaps a &s;ingular in&s;tance of the kind. But as the Scots, in tho&s;e days, made frequent irruptions even thus far into the coun|try; and as the monks had great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to defend in the valley of Borrodale; where one of their principal magazines was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; the holy fathers thought it proper to adopt this uncommon mea&s;ure. Be&s;ides their tythe-corn, they ama&s;&s;ed here the valuable minerals of the country; among which, &s;alt, produced from a &s;pring in the valley, was no incon&s;iderable article.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="256">We had now travelled three or four miles in this winding valley; which, as we ad|vanced, began to a&s;&s;ume a &s;ofter form. The hills became cloathed with verdure; and the little rece&s;&s;es of the valley, &s;haded with wood. The&s;e rece&s;&s;es al&s;o, which were before &s;hut up, and confined by rocky barriers, now open|ed in different &s;hapes; and many of them were plea&s;antly varied with wooded hillocs: while the &s;tony banks of the Derwent, began to change into meadows; &s;canty indeed; but affording pa&s;turage for a few cattle; and a plea&s;ant tint of verdure, as a contra&s;t with the rocky &s;cenery in it's neighbourhood.</P>
<P>We were now in that part of the valley, which is <HI>properly</HI> called the valley of Borro|dale&mdash;a large, circular rece&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of much broken ground; and, except where the valley &s;till pur&s;ues it's cour&s;e, &s;urrounded by lofty mountains; from which pour innumera|ble rills and torrents, tho little intere&s;ting in the &s;cene, as objects of picture&s;que beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="257">In this deep retreat lies the village of Ro&s;|thwait; having at all times, little intercour&s;e with the country; but during half the year, almo&s;t totally excluded from all human com|merce.</P>

Their herds afford them milk; and their flocks, cloaths; the &s;hepherd him&s;elf being often the manufacturer al&s;o. No dye is nece&s;&s;ary to tinge their wool: it is naturally a ru&s;&s;et-brown; and &s;heep and &s;hepherds are cloathed alike; both in the &s;im|ple livery of nature.</P>

this article is &s;ought either in pits, or on the &s;urface of the earth. Here the inhabitants are obliged to get it on the tops of mountains; which abounding with mo&s;&s;y grounds, &s;eldom found in the vallies below, &s;upply them with peat. The difficulty lies in conveying it from &s;uch immen&s;e heights. In doing this they have recour&s;e to a &s;trange, and dangerous ex|pedient; tho &s;imilar to the modes of con|veyance, which nece&s;&s;ity dictates in other mountainous countries.

<P>FROM Ro&s;thwait the valley pur&s;ues it's cour&s;e towards the ea&s;t; and lo&s;ing again it's milder features, grows every &s;tep more wild, and de&s;olate. After a march of two miles farther, we came to the village of <HI>Satterthwait,</HI> &s;till more intrenched in moun|tains, than Ro&s;thwait it&s;elf. Here, in the depth of winter, the &s;un never &s;hines. As the &s;pring advances, his rays begin to &s;hoot over the &s;outhern mountains; and at high noon to tip the chimney tops of the village. That radiant &s;ign &s;hews the cheerle&s;s winter to be now over; and rou&s;es the hardy pea&s;ant to the labours of the coming year.</P>
<P>A little beyond this &s;cene of de&s;olation, the Derwent, on who&s;e banks we &s;till continued, ru&s;hes down a long declivity between two
<PB N="200" REF="260">
mountains. At the fall of Lodoar the higher level comes <HI>abruptly</HI> upon the lower: here, the two levels are united by a <HI>gradual</HI> de&s;cent. The &s;treams of cour&s;e taking the &s;ame modes of precipitation as the land, the Lodoar forms a perpendicular fall; and the Derwent, a declivous one. But the fall of the Derwent is more &s;ingular; and is the only one of the kind perhaps in the country.</P>
<P>And here I cannot help remarking the &s;in|gular character of this mountain-&s;tream. There is not perhaps a river in England, which pa&s;&s;es through &s;uch a variety of different &s;cenes. What wild, romantic channel it &s;hapes, before it enter the vale of Borrodale, is to us un|known. There fir&s;t we commenced our ac|quaintance with it. It's pa&s;&s;age through that mountain-cha&s;m, is marked with objects, not only great in them&s;elves; but rarely to be found el&s;ewhere in &s;uch intere&s;ting combina|tions.</P>
<P>From a mountain-&s;tream it &s;oon a&s;&s;umes a new character, and changes into a lake; where it di&s;plays the wonders, we have ju&s;t &s;een.</P>
<P>From hence emerging, it again becomes a river: but &s;oon forms the lake of Ba&s;&s;enthwait;
<PB N="201" REF="261">
of form, and dimen&s;ions very different from that of Ke&s;wick.</P>
<P>Contracting it&s;elf again into a river, it puts on a character intirely new. Hitherto it has adorned only the wild, rough &s;cenes of nature. All the&s;e it now relinqui&s;hes&mdash;rocks&mdash;lakes&mdash; and mountains; and enters a &s;weet delightful country, where all it's accompaniments are &s;oft, and lovely. Among other places it vi&s;its the noble, and picture&s;que ruins of Cockermouth-ca&s;tle; under the walls of which it glides.</P>
<P>From hence it pa&s;&s;es to the &s;ea, which many &s;treams of greater con&s;equence never meet under their own names; but are ab&s;orbed by larger rivers: while the Derwent, after all the a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cenes it has adorned, adds to it's other beauties, tho&s;e of an e&s;tuary.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t part of it's cour&s;e it vi&s;its Workington-hall, one of the grande&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful &s;ituations of the country. Be&s;ides it's hanging woods, and &s;loping lawns, it is remarkable for having been the fir&s;t pri&s;on-hou&s;e of the unfortunate Mary of Scot|land, after &s;he had landed within the dominions of her rival. Here the Derwent becomes navigable; and forms the be&s;t natural harbour in Cumberland.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="262">I have often thought, that if a per&s;on wi&s;hed particularly to amu&s;e him&s;elf with picture&s;que &s;cenes, the be&s;t method he could take, would be to place before him a good map of England; and to &s;ettle in his head the cour&s;e of all the chief rivers of the country. The&s;e rivers &s;hould be the great directing lines of his excur&s;ions. On their banks he would be &s;ure, not only to find the mo&s;t beautiful views; but would al&s;o obtain a compleat &s;y&s;tem of every kind of land&s;cape. He would have no occa&s;ion to keep &s;o clo&s;e to the river he pur&s;ued, as not to deviate a little, for the &s;ake of a beautiful &s;cene. Ca&s;tles and abbeys this plan would almo&s;t univer&s;ally comprehend; for mo&s;t of them are &s;eated either on rocks, or knolls pro|jecting into rivers; or in &s;ome &s;weet valley, which opens to them. Bridges of cour&s;e it would include; which make a plea&s;ing &s;pecies of &s;cenery. Mountains, and lakes I need not mention: the former produce rivers; and the latter are produced by them. It would al&s;o include &s;ea-coa&s;t views; many of which are very intere&s;ting, when the e&s;tuary opens to
<PB N="203" REF="263">
&s;ome beautiful, winding &s;hore, with views of di&s;tant country.</P>
<P>I once attempted to analyze the Thames in this way. But I was obliged to divide &s;o magnificent a &s;ubject. Indeed it naturally divided it&s;elf into three parts&mdash;from Oxford to Wind&s;or&mdash;from Wind&s;or to London&mdash;and from London to the &s;ea. An imperial river, like the Thames, mu&s;t be navigated; at lea&s;t it's two lower divi&s;ions: but inferior rivers are be&s;t examined by an excur&s;ion along their banks.</P>
<P>We left the Derwent in it's declivous cour&s;e between two mountains. One of them, under who&s;e &s;hadow the torrent pours, is called Eagle's-cragg; as it's tremendous rocks are the chief habitation of the&s;e birds; and &s;eem to be con&s;idered by them as a &s;ort of ca&s;tle, which from time immemorial they have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. It is a common &s;pecies of traffic in this country to &s;upply the curious with young eagles; in the taking of which the inhabitants are very expert. They ob&s;erve the ne&s;ts from the bottom; and judging of the age of the young birds, they catch the opportunity,
<PB N="204" REF="264">
when the old eagles are abroad, and let them|&s;elves down by ropes from the &s;ummits of the cliffs. We &s;aw one which had been ju&s;t taken. It was only &s;ix weeks old; and was nearly of the &s;ize of a turkey-hen. It &s;eemed to have acquired already a full &s;hare of ferocity; and &s;creamed violently, if we offered to touch it.</P>
<P>Many large birds we &s;aw among&s;t the&s;e mountains, &s;ailing about the air, which we imagined to be eagles: but one of our com|pany, being a naturali&s;t, bad us ob&s;erve their tail feathers. If their tails were forked, they were of the buzzard &s;pecies: the tail of the eagle is circular.</P>
<P>Among the anecdotes we heard in this country of eagles, one was rather curious &mdash;An eagle was &s;een at a di&s;tance, to pounce it's prey; which it carried, in a perpendicular a&s;cent, aloft into the air; and hanging dubious for &s;ome time, it was at length ob&s;erved to de&s;cend in the &s;ame direct line; and it's fall, as it approached, &s;eemed attended with an odd, tumbling motion. The cau&s;e was &s;oon di&s;covered. It fell &s;tone dead on the ground; and a wea&s;el, which it had carried up, and which had had the addre&s;s to
<PB N="205" REF="265">
kill it's adver&s;ary in the air, being now at liberty, ran away.</P>
<P>We had accompanied the valley of Borro|dale as far to the ea&s;t, as Eagle's-cragg. It &s;tretches al&s;o to the we&s;t; tho in a more broken, and abrupt form.</P>
<P>Somewhat further, on this &s;ide, than Eagle's-cragg lies on the other, ri&s;e tho&s;e mountains, where the celebrated black-lead mine is wrought. I could not help feeling a friendly attachment to this place, which every lover of the pencil mu&s;t feel, as deriving from this mineral one of the be&s;t in&s;truments of his art; the free&s;t and readie&s;t expo&s;itor of his ideas. We &s;aw the &s;ite of the mine at a di&s;tance, marked with a dingy yellow &s;tain, from the ochery mixtures thrown from it's mouth, which &s;hiver down the &s;ides of the mountain.</P>
<P>During the periodical &s;ea&s;on of working it, for it is opened only once in &s;even years, many people pick up a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the &s;craps of black-lead, which e&s;cape among&s;t the coar&s;er &s;trata. The&s;e are hone&s;t gains. But a late prolific genius in fraud took a very indirect method of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a
<PB N="206" REF="266">
&s;hare of this rich mineral. A part of the mountain, contiguous to the mine, was his property. Here, at the expence of great labour, he &s;ank a &s;haft, which he carried diagonally, till he entered the mine; where, with &s;ubterraneous wickedne&s;s, he continued his depredations for &s;ome time undi&s;covered. At length his fraud was brought to light; and he was tried at Carli&s;le. The peculiarity of his ca&s;e had no precedent. He &s;aved his life; but a law was obtained by the proprietors of the mine, to defend their property from &s;uch indirect attacks for the future.</P>
<P>The &s;un was now declining, and it was too late to take a nearer view of the mine: nor indeed did it promi&s;e more on the &s;pot, than it di&s;covered at a di&s;tance. Be&s;ides, the beauties of Watenlath had been &s;o &s;trongly repre&s;ented to us; that we were re&s;olved to go in que&s;t of tho&s;e &s;cenes, in preference to any other.</P>
<P>Watenlath is that tract of mountainous country (it&s;elf &s;urrounded by mountains &s;till higher) which coming boldly forward, breaks down abruptly from the &s;outh, upon the vale
<PB N="207" REF="267" MS="y">
of Ke&s;wick. The &s;tream, which forms the fall of Lodoar, adorns fir&s;t the &s;cenes of Wa|tenlath.</P>
<P>"Which way to Watenlath?" &s;aid one of our company to a pea&s;ant, as we left the vale of Borrodale. "That way," &s;aid he, pointing up a lofty mountain, &s;teeper than the tiling of a hou&s;e.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e, who are accu&s;tomed to moun|tains, the&s;e perpendicular motions may be amu&s;ing: but to us, who&s;e ideas were le&s;s elevated, they &s;eemed rather peculiar. And yet there is &s;omething unmanly in conceiving a difficulty in traver&s;ing a path, which, we were told, the women of the country would a&s;cend on hor&s;eback, with their panniers of eggs, and butter, and return in the night. To move upwards, keeping a &s;teady eye on the objects before us, was no great exerci&s;e to the brain: but it rather gave it a rotation to look back on what was pa&s;t&mdash;and to &s;ee our companions below <HI>clinging,</HI> as it ap|peared, to the mountain's &s;ide; and the ri&s;ing brea&s;ts and bellies of their hor&s;es, &s;training up a path &s;o &s;teep, that it &s;eemed, as if the lea&s;t fal&s;e &s;tep would have carried them rolling many hundred yards to the bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="268">We had another apprehen&s;ion; that of mi&s;|taking our way. If a mi&s;t had &s;uddenly over&s;pread the mountain, which is a very common incident, we might have wandered all night: for we had not the precaution to take a guide. The que&s;tion we a&s;ked of the pea&s;ant, at the bottom of the mountain; "Which <HI>way</HI> to Watenlath?" we found was a very improper one. We &s;hould have a&s;ked, in what <HI>direction</HI> we were to &s;eek it? For <HI>way</HI> there was none; except here and there a blind path; which being it&s;elf often bewildered, of cour&s;e, &s;erved only to bewilder us. The inhabitants pay little attention to <HI>paths:</HI> they &s;teer along the&s;e wilds by <HI>land|marks,</HI> which to us were unknown.</P>
<P>At length however, after a painful perpen|dicular march of near two miles, and many a breathing pau&s;e, which our hor&s;es required, we gained the top. Here we expected at lea&s;t to be rewarded by an amu&s;ing pro&s;pect over the neighbouring country. But in this too we were di&s;appointed. We found our&s;elves in the mid&s;t of a bog, with &s;till higher grounds around us: &s;o that after all our toil, we had a view only of a vile circum&s;cribed wa&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="269">It was our bu&s;ine&s;s now to get out of this unplea&s;ant &s;cene, as &s;oon as we could, which was a matter of no great difficulty. An ea&s;y, and &s;hort de&s;cent, on the other &s;ide of the mountain, brought us quickly to Watenlath. Here our labours were amply rewarded. We fell into a piece of &s;cenery, which for beauty, and grandeur, was equal, if not &s;uperior, to any thing we had yet &s;een.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object we found was a &s;mall lake, about two miles in circumference, through which flows the Lodoar, and after a cour&s;e of three miles farther, forms that noble ca&s;|cade, which we had &s;een, in the morning, at the head of Derwentwater.</P>
<P>The accompaniments of this river, from the lake of Watenlath to it's fall, make the &s;cenery, of which we came hither in que&s;t.</P>
<P>It is a valley &s;o contracted, that it affords room for little more than the river, and a path, at the bottom; while the mountains, on each &s;ide, are &s;o perpendicular, that their &s;ummits are &s;carce more a&s;under than their ba&s;es. It was a new idea. Many mountains we had &s;een hanging over the &s;ides of vallies:
<PB N="210" REF="270">
but to be immured, through a &s;pace of almo&s;t three miles, within a cha&s;m of rifted rocks, (for that was in fact the idea pre&s;ented by the &s;cene before us,) was a novel circum&s;tance tho we had now been two or three days the inhabitants of mountains.</P>
<P>The form of this valley was very different from the valley of Borrodale. The one led us through a winding rout: the other is nearly a vi&s;ta. Each hath it's mode of grandeur. The valley of Borrodale has more variety: but this is certainly the more maje&s;tic &s;cene. The whole is only one va&s;t effort. In point of immen&s;ity indeed it yields to the vi&s;ta at the entrance into Cumberland. It is not &s;o va&s;t a <HI>whole:</HI> but being contracted within a &s;maller compa&s;s, we examine it's limits with more ea&s;e: and with regard to the grandeur and variety of the &s;everal <HI>objects,</HI> it lo&s;es no|thing. As we &s;tood <HI>under</HI> the beetling cliffs on each &s;ide, they were too near for in&s;pection: their har&s;h features wanted &s;oftening: but we had noble views of them all in order, both in <HI>pro&s;pect,</HI> and <HI>retro&s;pect.</HI> Not only the de|&s;ign, and compo&s;ition, but the very &s;trokes of nature's pencil might be traced through the whole &s;cene; every fractured rock, and every
<PB N="211" REF="271">
hanging &s;hrub, which adorned it, was brought within the compa&s;s of the eye: each touch &s;o carele&s;s, and yet &s;o determined: &s;o wildly irregular; and yet all conducing to one whole.</P>
<P>When we arrived at the clo&s;e of the valley, the grandeur of the &s;cene increa&s;ed. It open|ed into an amphitheatre, the area of which, like the valley, that led to it, was contracted; &s;carce containing the circumference of a mile: but the mountains, which invironed it, were grand and beautiful.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t of the &s;cenes we had pa&s;&s;ed, we were obliged to look for contra&s;t in the dif|ferent modes of de&s;olation: but here barren|ne&s;s was contra&s;ted with all the tints of vege|tation. The mountains in front, and on the left, were covered with wood, which mantled from the top to the bottom. Tho&s;e on the right were barren; yet broken &s;o variou&s;ly, as even in them&s;elves to make a contra&s;t. We admire the ruins of a Roman amphi|theatre: but what are the mo&s;t magnificent of the works of art, compared with &s;uch an amphitheatre as this? Were the Colo&s;&s;eum it&s;elf brought hither, and placed within this area, the grandeur of the idea would be lo&s;t;
<PB N="212" REF="272">
and the ruin, magnificent as it is, would dwindle into the <HI>ornament of a &s;cene.</HI></P>
<P>At the entrance of the amphitheatre, an|other bright mountain-torrent joins the Lodoar from the ea&s;t, and forms it into a more con|&s;iderable &s;tream. With increa&s;ed velocity, (the ground growing every &s;tep more declivous) it now pours along with great rapidity; and throwing it&s;elf into the thicke&s;t of the woods, which clo&s;e the &s;cene, di&s;appears. The ima|gination pur&s;ues it's progre&s;s. It's roar is heard through the woods; and it is plain from the &s;ound, that it &s;uffers &s;ome great convul|&s;ion. But all is clo&s;e; impervious rocks and thickets intervene, and totally exclude the &s;ight.</P>
<P>We indeed had been behind the &s;cenes; and knew we were, at that in&s;tant, upon the &s;ummit of the fall of Lodoar: but the ima|gination of a &s;tranger would be held in &s;ti|mulating &s;u&s;pen&s;e. The grandeur of the &s;ound would proclaim the dignity of the fall; and his eye would wi&s;h to participate of what his ear alone could inadequately judge.</P>
<P>Tho we had &s;een the fall of Lodoar from the bottom, we had a curio&s;ity to &s;ee how
<PB N="213" REF="273">
it appeared from the top; and di&s;mounting, we contrived, by winding round the thickets, and clinging to the projections of the rocks, to get a dangerous peep down the aby&s;s. There was nothing picture&s;que in the view, but &s;omething immen&s;ely grand. We &s;tood now above tho&s;e two cheeks of the cha&s;m, through which the water forced it's way; and which in the morning, when &s;een from the bottom, appeared towering to a great height, and were the mo&s;t intere&s;ting parts of the view. But amid&s;t the greatne&s;s of the objects, which now &s;urrounded them they were totally lo&s;t; appearing le&s;s than warts upon tho&s;e va&s;t limbs of nature, to which they adhered.</P>
<P>In our pa&s;&s;age through the valley of Waten|lath, we met with many fragments of rocks, in which the &s;everal component &s;trata were very &s;trongly marked. In &s;ome they could not have been more regularly formed by a rule and chi&s;&s;el: and in a few, (who&s;e &s;ofter lamina the weather had decayed,) as perfect cornices remained, as art could have produced.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="274">Having taken a view of all this &s;cenery, and the evening beginning now to clo&s;e, we thought it time to put a &s;top to our curio&s;ity, and return to Ke&s;wick; from which we were about four miles di&s;tant. In the morning we rode alone the edge of the lake: but as we were now upon the higher grounds, we were obliged to make a compa&s;s round the moun|tains.</P>
<P>The&s;e de&s;olate grounds are very little in|habited. We heard of a de&s;ign to introduce goats among them, with a view to make Ke&s;|wick as celebrated for drinking goat's-whey, as &s;everal of the mountainous parts of Scot|land. In &s;ome places indeed, where there are valuable woods, the goat might be a per|nicious inmate. But in many places, as we rode, the bare and craggy &s;ides of hills &s;eemed capable of feeding nothing el&s;e. Frequent little plots of herbage grow every where among the rocks, inacce&s;&s;ible to any other animal. Even &s;heep on many of the&s;e &s;loping &s;helves could find no footing. All this pa&s;turage
<PB N="215" REF="275">
therefore is lo&s;t for want of goats to brouze it.</P>
<P>In a picture&s;que light, no ornament is more adapted to a mountainous, and rocky coun|try, than the&s;e animals. Their colours are beautiful, (in tho&s;e particularly of a darker hue) often playing into each other with great harmony. But among the&s;e animals, (as among all others) the pied are the mo&s;t unplea&s;ing; in which oppo&s;ite colours come full upon each other, without any intervening tint.</P>
<P>The &s;haggine&s;s of the goat al&s;o is as beau|tiful, as the colours, which adorn him; his hair depending in that ea&s;y flow, which the pencil wi&s;hes to imitate.</P>
<P>His actions are &s;till more plea&s;ing. It would add new terror to a &s;cene, to &s;ee an animal brouzing on the &s;teep of a perpen|dicular rock; or hanging on the very edge of a projecting precipice. Virgil &s;eems to have looked at the&s;e attitudes of terror with delight:
<Q><L>&mdash;Ite, capellae;</L>

<P>IN our rout to Borrodale, we pa&s;&s;ed through the ea&s;tern, and &s;outhem parts of that mountainous country, which bounds the lake of Derwent:&mdash;in our next expedition we pro|po&s;ed to view the we&s;tern.</P>
<P>From Ke&s;wick we mounted the hills on the north-we&s;t of the lake; and, on the other &s;ide, fell into the valley of Newlands, which we traver&s;ed from end to end. It was a lovely &s;cene, totally different from the rude vallies we had yet met with. The mountains, in general, on this &s;ide of the lake wear a &s;moother form, than tho&s;e either on the ea&s;t, or on the &s;outh. Of this &s;moothne&s;s of fea|ture in the <HI>higher</HI> grounds the <HI>lower</HI> participate. The mountain vallies we had hitherto &s;een, were wild, rocky, and de&s;olate. But here
<PB N="218" REF="277">
the idea of terror was excluded. The valley of Newlands was even adorned with the beau|ties of luxuriant nature. We travelled through groves, which were &s;ometimes open, and &s;ometimes clo&s;e; with a &s;parkling &s;tream, the common attendant of the&s;e vallies, ac|companying us, through the whole &s;cene.</P>
<P>Having been amu&s;ed with this &s;weet &s;cenery about three miles, we entered another valley, or rather a mountain rece&s;s, called the valley of Ga&s;cadale. I call it a rece&s;s, becau&s;e it is &s;oon terminated by a mountain running athwart, which denies any further pa&s;&s;age. In&s;tead therefore of entering Ga&s;cadale, we were obliged to climb the hill, which forms one of it's &s;ides: and from the &s;ummit, we had a view not only of Ga&s;cadale, but of many other mountain rece&s;&s;es, all which par|ticipate more or le&s;s, of the &s;moothne&s;s of the high grounds in their neighbourhood. Some of them were &s;cooped, and hollowed into very beautiful forms; in which wood alone was wanting.</P>
<P>The valley of Ga&s;cadale had nothing to recommend it, but novelty. It was (a &s;cene
<PB N="219" REF="278">
wholly new in this rugged country) a deep mountain rece&s;s, invironed on every &s;ide, except the entrance, by &s;mooth, &s;loping hills, which are adorned neither with wood, nor rock, nor broken ground; but &s;weep down from &s;ide to &s;ide, with the greate&s;t regularity. We &s;carce remembered to have &s;een in any place, an operation of nature more completely formal. At the head of this rece&s;s is a grand ca&s;cade. We &s;uppo&s;ed it to be no great object of beauty, as it was probably void of all accom|paniments: but it's poverty was hid beneath a veil. The clouds which were gathering upon the mountains, and &s;weeping along the val|lies, began to intercept our view. Every thing was wrapped in ob&s;curity. When we &s;tood even on the &s;ummit of the ca&s;cade, we could only hear the torrent roar; but could not obtain the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of it, tho no object intervened. The whole valley of Ga&s;|cadale &s;moaked like a boiling caldron; and we got our ideas of it only by catches, as the volumes of clouds di&s;per&s;ed, at intervals, into purer air.</P>
<P>But what we lo&s;t in one re&s;pect by the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere, we gained in another. Tho it is probable &s;ome views were
<PB N="220" REF="279" MS="y">
ob&s;cured, which might have plea&s;ed as; it is equally probable, that many of tho&s;e di&s;gu&s;ting features, with which we might have been pre&s;ented, were &s;oftened, and rendered more agreeable to the eye.&mdash;Here indeed the mi&s;ty hue was, in general, laid on with too full a pencil. The face of nature was rather blotted out, than ob&s;cured. The whole view was in that &s;tate, which Thom&s;on &s;o well de|&s;cribes:
<Q><L>&mdash;No more the mountain fills the eye</L>
<L>With great variety; but in a night</L>
<L>Of gathering vapour, from the baffled &s;en&s;e,</L>
<L>Sinks dark and dreary. Thence expanding wide</L>
<L>The huge du&s;k gradual, &s;wallows up the plain.</L>
<L>Vani&s;h the woods. The dim &s;een river &s;eems</L>
<L>Sullen and &s;low to rowl the mi&s;ty wave.</L></Q></P>
<P>Among the beautiful appearances of fogs, and mi&s;ts, their <HI>gradually going off</HI> may be ob&s;erved. A land&s;cape takes a variety of plea&s;|ing hues, as it pa&s;&s;es, in a retiring fog, through the different modes of ob&s;curity into full &s;plendor.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="280" MS="y">There is great beauty al&s;o in a fog's <HI>partially clearing up at once,</HI> as it often does; and pre&s;enting &s;ome di&s;tant piece of land&s;cape under great radiance; when all the &s;urround|ing parts are &s;till in ob&s;curity. The curtain is not intirely drawn up; it is only ju&s;t rai&s;ed, to let in &s;ome beautiful, tran&s;ient view; and perhaps falling again, while we admire, leaves us that ardent reli&s;h, which we have for plea&s;ing objects &s;uddenly removed.&mdash;Some very beautiful ideas of this kind were di&s;played on the &s;ummits of Ga&s;cadale. Tho the moun|tains around us, and the contracted vallies in our neighbourhood, were all &s;o much ab&s;orbed in the dark atmo&s;phere of clouds and vapours; we could di&s;cover, in catches, through their thinner &s;kirts, the vale of Ke&s;wick, at a di&s;tance, over&s;pread with &s;erenity and &s;un|&s;hine.</P>
<P>The mountain, over which we pa&s;&s;ed, is called, in the language of the country, a <HI>haw&s;e,</HI> or &s;toppage, in pa&s;&s;ing from one di&s;trict to another; the valley being clo&s;ed, and no other way left. This <HI>haw&s;e,</HI> tho not &s;o &s;teep as the mountain, which led us to Watenlath,
<PB N="222" REF="281">
was of much longer continuance; and in &s;ome parts carried us very near the edges of preci|pices: but &s;urrounded by fogs, we kept the path before us; and if there was danger, we &s;eldom &s;aw it.</P>
<P>As we began to de&s;cend, we breathed a purer air; and got a &s;ight of the land&s;cape before us. It was a &s;cene, unlike what we had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed; but only, as the botani&s;t &s;peaks, a variety of the &s;ame genus; corre|&s;ponding intirely with the character of the country, which we now traver&s;ed. Three broad mountains, &s;loping into each other, formed a tripartite valley, centering in one point. The &s;urface of each mountain was &s;mooth to it's very &s;ummit; except that, here and there, a few large &s;tones lay &s;cattered about: &s;ome of them fixed in the &s;oil; but none of them de&s;erving the appellation of a rock. Through two of the divi&s;ions of this valley ran different &s;treams; each of them as unfringed, and &s;imple, as the mountains they &s;evered. The&s;e &s;treams uniting in the centre, formed a third. The whole was a peculiar and novel &s;cene; but neither intere&s;ting, nor picture&s;que.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="282">The&s;e &s;mooth-coated mountains, tho of little e&s;timation in the painter's eye, are how|ever great &s;ources of plenty. They are the nur&s;eries of &s;heep; which are bred here, and fatted in the vallies.</P>
<P>But the life of a &s;hepherd, in this country, is not an Arcadian life. His occupation &s;ub|jects him to many difficulties, in the winter e&s;pecially, when he is often obliged to attend his flock on the bleak &s;ide of a mountain, which engages him in many a painful vigil. And when the mountains are covered with &s;now, which is frequently the ca&s;e, his em|ployment becomes then a dangerous one. It &s;eldom happens, but that &s;ome part of his flock is &s;nowed up; and in pre&s;erving their lives, he mu&s;t often expo&s;e his own.</P>
<P>After winding about two miles along the edge of one of the&s;e &s;mooth mountains, we dropped at once into a beautiful vale, called the vale of Butermer, the bottom of which was adorned by a lake of the &s;ame name.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="283">This lake is &s;mall; about a mile and a half in length, and half a mile in breadth; of an oblong form; &s;weeping, at one end, round a woody promontory. But this &s;weep is rather forced; and from &s;ome points makes too acute an angle. It is one of tho&s;e lines, which would have a better effect from a boat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 96.</NOTE>. A lower point would &s;often it's abruptne&s;s. In other parts al&s;o the lines of this lake are rather too &s;quare. The &s;cenery however about it is grand, and beautiful.</P>
<P>On the we&s;tern &s;ide, a long range of moun|tainous declivity extends from end to end; falling every where precipitately into the water, at lea&s;t it had that appearance to the eye: tho on the &s;pot probably a margin of meadow might &s;hoot from the bottom of the mountain, as we ob&s;erved at Ke&s;wick. Of the line, which the &s;ummit of this mountain formed, we could not ea&s;ily judge; as it was in a great mea&s;ure hid in clouds.</P>
<P>The ea&s;tern &s;ide of the lake is woody; and contra&s;ts happily with the we&s;tern. But the wood is of that kind, which is periodically
<PB N="225" REF="284">
cut down, and was not in perfection, when we &s;aw it.</P>
<P>Near the bottom of this lake, is the loftie&s;t ca&s;cade we had ever &s;een. It hardly, I think, falls through a le&s;s de&s;cent than three or four hundred yards. But it is an object of no beauty; it is barren of accompaniments; and appears, at a di&s;tance, like a white ribbon bi&s;ecting the mountain. The people of the country, alluding to the whitene&s;s of it's foam, call it <HI>&s;our-milk-force.</HI></P>
<P>The vale of Butermer is rather confined in that part, which the lake occupies. Below, it extends a con&s;iderable way: but our rout led us fir&s;t above, in que&s;t of &s;ome rocky mountains, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the highe&s;t precipices in the country. The&s;e &s;cenes, which are known by the name of <HI>Gate&s;garth|dale,</HI> open at the head of the lake.</P>
<P>Here we found two vallies, formed by a mountain on each &s;ide, and one in the middle. The right hand valley was &s;oon clo&s;ed by a <HI>haw&s;e:</HI> that on the left led directly to the &s;cenes we &s;ought.</P>
<P>The tran&s;ition here, contrary to the u&s;ual proce&s;s of nature, is abrupt. We had been travelling, all the morning, among mountains
<PB N="226" REF="285">
perfectly &s;mooth, and covered with herbage; and now found our&s;elves &s;uddenly among craggs and rocks, and precipices, as wild, and hide|ous, as any we had &s;een.</P>
<P><HI>Gate&s;garth-dale,</HI> into which we &s;oon entered, is indeed a very tremendous &s;cene. Like all the vallies we had yet found, it had a peculiar character. It's features were it's own. It was not a vi&s;ta like the valley of Watenlath; nor had it any of the &s;udden turns of the valley of Borrodale: but it wound &s;lowly, and &s;o|lemnly in one large &s;egment. It was wider al&s;o than either of tho&s;e vallies; being at lea&s;t half a quarter of a mile from &s;ide to &s;ide; which di&s;tance it pretty uniformly ob&s;erved; the rocky mountains, which invironed it, keeping their line with great exactne&s;s; at lea&s;t, never breaking out into any violent projections.</P>
<P>The area of this valley is, in general, con|cave; the &s;ides almo&s;t perpendicular, compo&s;ed of a kind of broken craggy rock, the ruins of which every where &s;trew the valley; and give it &s;till more the idea of de&s;olation.</P>
<P><PB REF="286"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="287" MS="y">The river al&s;o, which runs through it, and is the principal &s;upply of the lake, is as wild as the valley it&s;elf. It has no banks, but the fragments of rocks; no bed, but a channel compo&s;ed of rocky &s;trata, among which the water forces it's cour&s;e. It's chan|nel, as well as it's bank, is formed of loo&s;e &s;tones, and fragments, which break, and di|vide the &s;tream into a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of wild, im|petuous eddies.</P>
<P>A &s;tream, which is the natural &s;ource of plenty, is perhaps when unaccompanied with verdure, the &s;tronge&s;t emblem of de&s;olation. It &s;hews the &s;pot to be &s;o barren, that even the greate&s;t &s;ource of abundance can produce nothing. The whole valley indeed joined in impre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame idea. Fruitful nature, making in every part of her ample range, un|remitting efforts to vegetate, could not here produce a &s;ingle germin.</P>
<P>As we proceeded, the grandeur of the valley increa&s;ed. We had been prepared indeed to &s;ee the highe&s;t precipices, which the country produced. Such a preface is generally pro|ductive of di&s;appointment; but on this occa&s;ion it did no injury. The fancy had &s;till it's &s;cope. We found the mountains &s;o over-hung with
<PB N="228" REF="288">
clouds, that we could form little judgment of their height. Our guide told us, they were twice as high, as we could &s;ee: which however we did not believe from the ob&s;erva|tions we were able to make, as the clouds, at intervals, floated pa&s;t; and di&s;covered, here and there, the &s;hadowy forms of the rocky &s;ummits. A great height however they cer|taily were; and the darkne&s;s, in which they were wrapped, gave us a new illu&s;tration of the grandeur of tho&s;e ideas, which ari&s;e from ob&s;curity.
<Q>Dark, confu&s;ed, uncertain ima|ges, Mr. Burk very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, have a greater power on the fancy to form the grander pa&s;&s;ions, than tho&s;e, which are more clear, and determinate. For hardly any thing can &s;trike the mind with it's greatne&s;s, which does not make &s;ome &s;ort of approach towards infinity; which no|thing can do, whil&s;t we are able to per|ceive it's bounds: but to &s;ee an object di&s;tinctly, and to perceive it's bounds, is one, and the &s;ame thing. A clear idea therefore is another name for a little idea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the &s;ublime, and beautiful. Part II. Sect. IV.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="289">The middle of the valley is adorned, as the&s;e vallies, in &s;ome part, often are, by a craggy hill; on the top of which &s;tands the fragment of a rock; that looks, in O&s;&s;ian's language, like the <HI>&s;tone of power</HI>&mdash;the rude deity of de&s;olation, to which the &s;cene is &s;acred.</P>
<P>This valley is not more than &s;ix miles from the black-lead mines; and would have led us to them, if we had pur&s;ued it's cour&s;e.</P>
