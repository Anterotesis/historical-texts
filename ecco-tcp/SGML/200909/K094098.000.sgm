<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PROPRIETY and affection alike incline me to in&s;cribe to you the
follow|ing undertaking. We are mutual and peculiar &s;ufferers by the event of
the campaign in 1777. You were witne&s;&s;es and judges of my actions; but I
owed you an account of the principles which directed them.</P>
<P>Another motive for this Addre&s;s is to avail my&s;elf of a proper
public op|portunity to repeat to you, what I have omitted no occa&s;ion of
expre&s;&s;ing in Parliament, in corre&s;pondence, and in
conver&s;ation&mdash;the fulle&s;t approbation of your &s;ervices. My errors
may have been numberle&s;s; your conduct has been uniform&mdash;faithful,
gallant and indefatigable. Debarred of the power of doing you ju&s;tice before
the King, the&s;e te&s;timonies are the only means to which my e&s;teem and
gratitude can re&s;ort.</P>
<P>After vindicating my&s;elf as a commanding officer from any
inattention to your intere&s;t or fame, I next throw my&s;elf upon your
judgment for my con|duct as a friend.</P>
<P>You will find by this publication, and &s;ome others, which though
not addre&s;&s;ed to you will probably engage your curio&s;ity, that I have
been accu&s;ed of &s;hrinking from the common captivity.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4"> I have been &s;upported under that
a&s;per&s;ion by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s I did not de&s;erve it, and the
confidence that you (to whom chiefly upon that charge I was re&s;pon&s;ible)
would not adopt it. After the fortunes we have run to|gether, it is not
&s;urely unworthy of belief, that I &s;hould rather have de&s;ired, than
avoided to partake the clo&s;ing &s;cene: uniting with a due &s;en&s;e of
per|&s;onal attachments, the pre&s;ervation of my military fortune, and a
retreat from the di&s;tractions of my country. The defence of your honour and
my own, at one time, and re&s;i&s;tance to an affront<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The part of my treatment which I call an affront upon this and
other occa&s;ions, is the re|fu&s;al of my &s;ervice in this country, even at
the head of my own regiment, or as a volunteer, in the time of exigency, and
when other officers <HI>preci&s;ely in my own &s;ituation</HI> were employed.
My complaint of this partiality has never been officially an&s;wered; it has
only been evaded by anonymous writers, who have laid it down as a po&s;ition,
that I meant to allude to the example of Lord Harrington (with which it
certainly has nothing to do) and then have taken a merit in refuting me. The
particular example to which I appeal is that of Lieutenant Colonel King|&s;ton,
of the 86th regiment, appointed to that regiment, employed in it for the
defence of Ply|mouth, and actually now embarking with it for foreign &s;ervice,
under the &s;ame terms of the convention, and the &s;ame terms of parole to the
Congre&s;s verbatim with my&s;elf. Other objec|tions, and of a nature that
could not be afterwards &s;upported, were tried again&s;t the Duke of Rutland's
recommendation of this excellent officer: but the objection of parole, though
fully known to be preci&s;ely the &s;ame with that which was &s;o peremptorily
urged again&s;t my preten|&s;ions, was never mentioned.</NOTE> which my nature
could not bear, at another, alone detained me here.</P>
<P>In regard to my political tran&s;actions, I have &s;tated them,
and I wi&s;h them to be con&s;idered by my friends, apart from my miltary
conduct. I bear very high re&s;pect to &s;ome eminent and ill-treated
characters in our pro|fe&s;&s;ion, who in deference to the tranquility of
government, have &s;ilently re|&s;igned the &s;tations which they could no
longer hold with &s;ecurity to their honour, or benefit to the &s;tate. But the
option is not left to tho&s;e, who ha|ving a voice in Parliament are obliged to
act as citizens as well as &s;oldiers. The number of officers altogether of the
army and navy, who with known love to their country and profe&s;&s;ional
&s;pirit equally con&s;picuous, have vo|luntarily withdrawn them&s;elves from
employment within the&s;e two years, exceeds all precedent. I do not place my
name in the li&s;t with the &s;ame preten&s;ions; but it is not arrogant to
emulate where we cannot compare; and I am de&s;irous of following the high
examples before me in no point more than in that of avoiding to di&s;turb the
zeal of tho&s;e who are now em|ployed. The officers who have held it their duty
to take part in oppo&s;ition, have acted openly and directly in their place in
Parliament; but they may <PB N="v" REF="5"> defy malice to &s;hew an in&s;tance
wherein they have not encouraged ardour in their profe&s;&s;ion. They
contemplate with one and the &s;ame &s;entiment the great &s;upply of
honourable men to occupy their places.</P>
<P>You, Gentlemen, &s;tand high in that de&s;cription; your trials
have made you of &s;terling value; and perhaps it will be better di&s;cerned by
men in power, when no longer viewed through the unfavourable medium of my
friend&s;hip. If my exhortations retain their former weight, let me be
permit|ted earne&s;tly to apply them upon this occa&s;ion. The examples of
generals or admirals who decline employment, re&s;pect only &s;imilar ca&s;es;
your honour is &s;ecure: look not at profe&s;&s;ional di&s;appointments; but
point all your views to the true glory of your King and country, and tru&s;t
for the reward.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for men who have acted critical
parts in public &s;tations to make an appeal to the world in their own
ju&s;tification, there are many prudential con&s;iderations which might lead
them to commit the care of it to friends, or, which is in many re&s;pects the
&s;ame thing, to defend them&s;elves under an a&s;&s;umed character. The charge
of vanity u&s;ually made on egoti&s;m is thus eluded: a fuller &s;cope may be
given to &s;elf-love and parti|cular re&s;entment: even the lower vexations
which attend an author are to a great degree avoided: the ill-nature of
critici&s;m is &s;eldom awakened by anonymous writings, and the venal pens of
party lo&s;e half their gall when the object of it is not per&s;onally and
directly in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ituations, in which, not only general a&s;&s;ent
&s;eems to ju&s;tify a man in &s;peaking of him&s;elf, but in which al&s;o no
little con&s;ideration ought to be admitted to the mind. Such will be the
ca&s;e, if I am not deceived, when the intere&s;ts of the public are blended
with tho&s;e of the individual; and when his very errors may &s;erve as
in&s;truction to others. Misfortunes which awaken &s;en&s;ibility will be a
further, and a per&s;ua&s;ive call, upon the <HI>attention</HI> of the public;
and it will amount to a claim upon their <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> if he can &s;hew
that he has been injuriou&s;ly treated.</P>
<P>Upon maturely weighing the&s;e and &s;everal other
circum&s;tances, after I had been denied a profe&s;&s;ional examination of my
conduct, and di&s;appointed of a parliamentary one, I determined to lay before
the public a &s;tate of the expe|dition from Canada, in 1777, in my own name.
And my fir&s;t de&s;ign was to do it under the title, and with the latitude of
Memoirs; as a mode by which I could be&s;t open the principles of my actions,
and introduce, with mo&s;t propriety, collateral characters, incidents, and
di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, as they might occa&s;ionally tend to illu&s;trate the main
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>However, in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, the enquiry
which had not been agreed to the year before, took place. I had pre&s;&s;ed it,
and I entered into it under all the di&s;advantages which attend a &s;truggle
with power, and <PB N="viii" REF="7"> the prejudice that power can rai&s;e
again&s;t the per&s;ons it means to de&s;troy. The utmo&s;t that power could do
was done; the Paliament was prorogued pending the proceedings. But though by
this contrivance, a final and for|mal adjudication by that augu&s;t
a&s;&s;embly was avoided, their minutes &s;tand a &s;acred record of truth and
ju&s;tice, and the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory reliance to which my wi&s;hes could
a&s;pire, in offering my actions to the judgment of my country at large.</P>
<P>From that time, therefore, I re&s;olved to publi&s;h, in&s;tead of
Memoirs, the Proceedings preci&s;ely as they pa&s;&s;ed in Parliament, and to
continue my de|fence by &s;uch Ob&s;ervations and Comments upon the Evidence,
as I &s;hould have had a right, and was prepared to make, had the proceedings
in the hou&s;e continued.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The order in which the
committee in the Hou&s;e of Commons proceeded was, to hear Sir William Howe's
Narrative, re&s;pecting his conduct whil&s;t in command in America, and &s;uch
evidence as he thought proper to bring in &s;upport of it. They next heard my
Narrative and Evidence, re&s;pecting the conduct of the expedition from Canada.
Lord George Germain then opened a defence on his part, and &s;ummoned
witne&s;&s;es to &s;upport it. According to the arrange|ment made by the
committee, Sir William Howe and my&s;elf were afterwards to be heard in reply;
but the proceedings were ended by the prorogation of Parliament before the
examina|tion of Lord George's &s;econd witne&s;s, Mr. Galloway, was clo&s;ed,
and there were &s;ixteen or eigh|teen more upon his li&s;t. The order in which
the following papers are placed is&mdash;1&s;t. The Pre|fatory Speech. 2d. The
Narrative. 3d. Minutes of the verbal evidence. 4th. Review of the evidence,
with Remarks and Explanations, &amp;c. 5th. An Appendix, containing the written
evi|dence.</NOTE></P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly in this latter part &s;ome colour of my original
de&s;ign may remain. The &s;cenes I have been engaged in are uncommon, and it
is a natural de&s;ire to place them in a full light. The intere&s;ts concerned
make that de&s;ire more urgent; and I dare believe they will be be&s;t guarded
by being mo&s;t ex|plained.</P>

<HEAD>The SPEECH of Lieutenant General BURGOYNE, prefatory to his
NARRATIVE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. MONTAGU,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE I enter upon the narrative, which the precedent of your
late proceedings authori&s;es me to lay before you, I think it a duty to the
committee, to promi&s;e that I &s;hall trouble them with little other matter
than &s;uch as may be nece&s;&s;ary to elucidate the tran&s;actions of the
campaign 1777, in that quarter where I commanded.</P>
<P>I &s;hall keep in mind, that to explain the cau&s;es of the
di&s;a&s;ter at Saratoga is the principal point to which all my evidence ought
to lead: but at the &s;ame time, I &s;hall take confidence in the ju&s;tice and
benevolence of my hearers, that where arguments in exculpation of the commander
can aptly be combined with a faithful repre&s;enta|tion of facts, they will not
be deemed foreign to the main object under their con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e ideas, though &s;ome introductory explanations are
requi&s;ite, I &s;hall &s;uppre&s;s the inclination I at fir&s;t conceived, of
&s;tating my conduct from the time, when, conjointly with my honourable friend
who took the lead in this enquiry,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir William
Howe.</NOTE> I was called to the un&s;olicited and unwelcome &s;ervice in
America: nor will I enume|rate the complicated circum&s;tances of private
misfortune and ill health under which I pur&s;ued it. Prudence, as well as
other propriety, is, I confe&s;s, con&s;ulted in this &s;uppre&s;&s;ion; for
were it &s;een, that an officer had blended with the re&s;pect due to
authority, warm, though di&s;intere&s;ted per&s;onal attachments; that under a
per&s;ua&s;ion of the honour and integrity of the king's &s;ervants, he had
united to his zeal for the public cau&s;e an intere&s;t in their private credit
and ambition; would it not be con|ceived, that his guilt mu&s;t have been
atrocious, beyond all excu&s;e or palliation, to induce the very men to whom
his endeavours, and his faculties, &s;uch as they were, had been thus devoted,
not only completely to de&s;ert him, but to preclude him, as far as in them
lay, from every means of defence, and if po&s;&s;ible, to ruin him in the
opinion of the king, the army, and the country?</P>
<P>An earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ave, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the time
of the committee, would al&s;o di&s;&s;uade me from recurring to any points
previous to my in&s;tructions which have been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed upon former
occa&s;ions; but I find that great &s;tre&s;s is &s;till laid to my prejudice
upon a paper which found its way to the hou&s;e during my ab&s;ence: I mean the
private letter to the noble lord, &s;ecretary for the American department,
dated 1&s;t January, 1777.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix No.
I.</NOTE></P>
<P>The noble Lord has frequently &s;tated that letter to have
&s;lipped inadvertently into the parcel de&s;tined for the hou&s;e, and I give
credit in that particular to his a&s;&s;ertion; <PB N="2" REF="9"> becau&s;e,
whatever other impre&s;&s;ions he might have found it his intere&s;t to make
re|&s;pecting me, he certainly would not have thought that the imputation on me
which that letter tended to fix, a proper one for <HI>him</HI> to put forward:
it is a notorious fact, or I would not mention it, that it has been held a
reflection upon my character (by the part of the public with whom the noble
lord is unpopular) that I addre&s;&s;ed him as a patron and friend.</P>
<P>This is an imputation to which I mu&s;t plead guilty; for at the
time I wrote that letter, I certainly did hold that noble lord as my friend,
and I had acted to de&s;erve he &s;hould be &s;o. The next ill tendency of that
paper was, as the noble lord well knows, to impre&s;s the public with an
opinion, that I was endeavouring to &s;upplant Sir Guy Carleton in the command
of the northern army&mdash;an action abhorrent to the honour of an officer and
the liberality of a gentleman; and of which, thank God, I can prove the
fal&s;ehood, by irrefragable evidence upon your table, and in a very &s;mall
compa&s;s. I need only refer to the di&s;patches to Sir Guy Carleton by his aid
de-camp, dated 22d Augu&s;t, 1776,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix No.
II.</NOTE> four months before I came home, to &s;hew that it was at that time
determined, that Sir Guy Carleton &s;hould remain in Canada; and that
determination was made, as I have been informed, not only upon the political
rea&s;oning which appears in that di&s;patch, but al&s;o, upon great law
opinions, that he could not, under the commi&s;&s;ion he then held under the
great &s;eal, pa&s;s the frontiers of his province. Sir, this confutation was
urged by me la&s;t year; and were collateral proof nece&s;&s;ary to my
ju&s;tification upon this &s;ub|ject, I could bring to your bar a tribe of
gentlemen, who had imbibed impre&s;&s;ions not very favourable to the military
proceedings of Sir Guy Carleton in the campaign of 1776: I could &s;hew that I
&s;eized numberle&s;s, indeed I &s;eized every po&s;&s;ible oc|ca&s;ion to
vindicate the judgment, the a&s;&s;iduity, the activity of that highly
re&s;pectable officer, carele&s;s how ill I paid my court, earne&s;t to meet
every attack again&s;t his fame.</P>
<P>I beg leave al&s;o to call the attention of the committee very
particularly to one other paper, the date of which is previous to my departure
from England: it is en|titled, "Thoughts for conducting the War from the Side
of Canada, by Lieutenant General Burgoyne."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">No.
III.</NOTE> Sir, it will be in the recollection of the committee, whe|ther,
when the conduct of the war was under con&s;ideration la&s;t year in my
ab&s;ence, it was not under&s;tood, that the plan of the northern expedition
was formed upon that paper as produced upon your table? If &s;o, I mu&s;t a&s;k
the noble lord, why he &s;uffer|ed that error to prevail? The noble lord knew,
(and it was peculiarly his duty to declare it) that the two propo&s;als, the
fir&s;t of turning the expedition eventually to|wards Connecticut; and the
&s;econd, of embarking the army in the river St. Law|rence, in order to effect
a junction with Sir William Howe by &s;ea, in ca&s;e the attempt by land
appeared 
<Q REND="inline">"impracticable, or too hazardous,"</Q> were
era&s;ed while the paper was in his lord&s;hip's hands.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10"> From that paper, as it appeared without
era&s;ures, naturally aro&s;e the conclu&s;ion, that the plan I had to execute
was completely my own; upon that paper were founded, as naturally, the doubts
which have been entertained upon the peremptory tenor of my in&s;tructions. I
mu&s;t again a&s;k the noble lord, upon what principle of ju&s;tice he
&s;uf|fered tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions to exi&s;t in this hou&s;e? Why, in a
debate in which he took a part, did he conceal, that the circum&s;tances in
reality were totally different from tho&s;e upon which gentlemen rea&s;oned;
that the di&s;cretion re&s;erved in the paper be|fore the hou&s;e was taken
away, and con&s;equently, that my orders were rendered ab|&s;olute in the
&s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e by his own alterations?</P>
<P>Let any gentleman who has &s;uppo&s;ed I had an implied latitude
for my conduct, now compare this circum&s;tance with the wording of the letter
to Sir Guy Carleton, dated March 26, 1777, with a copy of which I was
furni&s;hed, and extracts from which were afterwards the only orders I had to
act upon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix No. IV.</NOTE></P>
<P>I &s;hall take no particular notice of what is called the &s;aving
clau&s;e, in the latter part of the orders, except to give the flatte&s;t
contradiction to the &s;uppo&s;ition that I dictated it&mdash;a &s;uppo&s;ition
that I know is not yet abandoned by the men who fir&s;t &s;ug|ge&s;ted it. I
have &s;poke to it very fully upon a former occa&s;ion;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The debate upon Mr. Vyner's motion, May 28, 1778; the
&s;peech was publi&s;hed.</NOTE> and I do not wi&s;h, when it can be avoided,
to enforce or reiterate the charges of duplicity and treachery which mu&s;t
en&s;ue, if that clau&s;e could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have reference to any
conduct previous to my arrival at Albany. The circum&s;tance of forbidding me
the latitude in the two particulars I had propo&s;ed in my plan, and many other
circum&s;tances, clearly indicating the decided intentions and expectations of
the mini&s;ters, rendered the &s;en&s;e of the whole order taken together clear
and di&s;tinct, and &s;hewed that the clau&s;e which is pretended to have left
me a di&s;cretion as to my main object, had no &s;ort of relation to that
object. That clau&s;e evidently related not to my forcing my way, or not
forcing it, to Albany, the place of my de&s;tination, but to &s;uch collateral
and eventual operations as might be advi&s;eable in the cour&s;e of my march.
It related to the making impre&s;&s;ion upon the rebels, and bringing them to
obedience, in &s;uch manner as exigencies might require, and in my judgment
might &s;eem mo&s;t proper, previous to receiving orders from Sir William Howe,

<Q REND="inline">"of my junction with whom I was never to lo&s;e
view."</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding there has been &s;o much di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in
debate and print upon the interpretation of ab&s;olute orders, the committee, I
am confident, will ab&s;olve me, though, at the expence of a few moments more,
I &s;hould continue a &s;ubject upon which the merit or blame of the future
proceedings in great mea&s;ure re&s;ts.</P>
<P>I do not admit the po&s;ition, that there can be no ca&s;e in
which an officer acting at a di&s;tance is bound at every hazard to pur&s;ue
orders, that appear ab&s;olute <HI>and deci&s;ive.</HI> <PB N="4" REF="11"> It
is ea&s;y to conceive circum&s;tances, which might ju&s;tify a &s;tate in
hazarding an army, for the &s;ake of facilitating great and deci&s;ive objects.
Gentlemen, conver&s;ant in military hi&s;tory, will recollect many examples of
this principle: upon a former occa&s;ion, I &s;tated a &s;uppo&s;ed
ca&s;e;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ca&s;e alluded to was put in a former
debate, as follows: &s;uppo&s;e the Briti&s;h army that invaded Britany in
1758, had gained a complete victory over the Duke D'Aiguillon; to have marched
rapidly towards Paris, abandoning the communication with the fleet, expo&s;ing
the army po&s;&s;ibly to great want of provi&s;ion, and to the impracticability
of retreat, would certainly have been a mea&s;ure con&s;ummately de&s;|perate
and unju&s;tifiable, if tried upon military &s;y&s;tem; yet, will any man
&s;ay, that if that mea&s;ure mu&s;t evidently have produced &s;uch alarm and
confu&s;ion in the heart of France, as to have compelled the recall of her
whole force from Germany, or &s;uch part of it, as would have given
uncontrouled &s;cope to the armies under the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and Prince
Ferdinand, that the mini&s;ter of England would not have been judicious, though
at the palpable ri&s;k of the army, as far as capture was concerned, in
ordering the ge|neral to proceed by the mo&s;t <HI>vigorous exertions,</HI> and
to force his way to Paris?</NOTE> and I now entreat leave to add a real example
of peremptory orders, which happened in the cour&s;e of my own &s;ervice. I
have ever re|tained the impre&s;&s;ion, that the circum&s;tance I am going to
relate, made upon my mind at the time; and to tho&s;e few who may &s;till
think, that in any part of my conduct, I ra&s;hly ri&s;ked my peace, my
intere&s;t or my fame, to forward the wi&s;hes of others, this
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion may in &s;ome mea&s;ure account for, and excu&s;e my
imprudence.</P>
<P>In the campaign of 1762, in Portugal, the Count La Lippe, a name,
which, if it finds a due hi&s;torian, will &s;tand among the fir&s;t in
military fame, was placed at the head of about 6000 Briti&s;h troops, and a
Portugue&s;e army, the greater part of which was little better than nominal, to
defend an exten&s;ive frontier again&s;t the whole force of Spain, and a large
body of the veteran troops of France. The &s;alvation of Por|tugal depended
&s;olely on the capacity of that great man, which united the deepe&s;t
political rea&s;oning with exqui&s;ite military addre&s;s.</P>
<P>I had the honour to be entru&s;ted with the defence of the mo&s;t
important pa&s;s upon the Tagus, and my orders were peremptory to maintain it
again&s;t any numbers, and to the la&s;t man.</P>
<P>A &s;elect corps of the enemy, greatly &s;uperior to mine, were
encamped within &s;ight on the other &s;ide the river, and our advanced po&s;ts
were within half mu&s;quet &s;hot.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, I received intelligence from Count La Lippe,
of a de&s;ign of the enemy to pa&s;s the Tagus in force, about &s;ix miles
above me, and to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the open country in my rear, with a
large corps of cavalry, by which means all com|munication, &s;upply, or &s;afe
retreat, would be cut off.</P>
<P>Together with this intelligence, the Count's letter expre&s;&s;ed,

<Q REND="inline">"That every delay to the enemy in getting
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;s I guarded, was &s;o material to his other
plans and operations, that it ju&s;tified a deviation from &s;y&s;tematic
rules; that, therefore, after taking timely precautions to &s;ecure the retreat
of my cavalry, I mu&s;t abide the con&s;equence with the infantry; that at the
la&s;t extremity, I mu&s;t abandon my cannon, camp, &amp;c. and with &s;uch
provi&s;ion as the men could carry <PB N="5" REF="12"> upon their backs, throw
my&s;elf into the mountains upon my left, and endea|vour, by &s;mall and
di&s;per&s;ed parties, to gain a rendezvous at the northern part of the
province."</Q> I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that when the&s;e peremptory orders were
given, the commander was at a di&s;tance that made all timely communication of
cir|cum&s;tances as impo&s;&s;ible, as if the Atlantic had been between us; and
I cannot clo&s;e the example without mentioning the concluding part of Count La
Lippe's letter. 
<Q REND="inline">"He participated," he &s;aid, "in the feelings
with which an officer would be &s;truck for his reputation, in &s;uffering
him&s;elf to be cut, and reduced to &s;acrifice his camp, his baggage, and
twenty pieces of cannon. But <HI>be at ea&s;e,</HI>" continued that great and
generous man, "<HI>I will take the mea&s;ure entirely upon my&s;elf,
per&s;evere as I have directed, and be confident of my defence and
protection.</HI>"</Q> This was a &s;aving clau&s;e of a nature very different
from tho&s;e it is the practice in the pre&s;ent day to pen; and if any man
doubts the quotation, I can bring po&s;itive evidence to the truth of it
ver|batim.</P>
<P>Thus much, Sir, I thought it incumbent upon me to &s;tate in
argument again&s;t the po&s;ition that has been in&s;i&s;ted upon, that no
orders can be worded &s;o perempto|rily at a di&s;tance, as not to admit of an
implied latitude, in ca&s;e of unfore&s;een and in&s;urmountable difficulties:
but to prevent all future cavil, upon this &s;ubject, I re|que&s;t the
committee to recollect, what I have again and again repeated; that I by no
means put my defence, in pa&s;&s;ing the Hud&s;on's River, &s;olely upon this
rea&s;oning. On the contrary, &s;uppo&s;ing for the argument's &s;ake, I
&s;hould concede (which I never have done, nor mean to do) to the noble Lord,
and to every other gentleman, all they can de&s;ire to a&s;&s;ume upon implied
latitude in given ca&s;es, I &s;hould equally prove that no &s;uch ca&s;e did
exi&s;t, as would have ju&s;tified me upon their own principle, in de|parting
from the letter of the orders under which I acted.</P>
<P>Having thus cleared my way to the time of my leaving England, to
take upon me the command of the Northern expedition; I &s;hall now lay before
the committee a narrative of its progre&s;s, in as conci&s;e and &s;imple
terms, as the nature of the &s;ubject will allow, endeavouring to imitate the
per&s;picuity of the honourable gentle|man who took the lead in this
bu&s;ine&s;s, and not without hope of my endeavours pro|ducing the &s;ame
effect; and that, in the opinion of the hou&s;e, my language, as has been
expre&s;&s;ed of his, will be deemed the language of truth.</P>

<HEAD>NARRATIVE.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">NARRA|TIVE.</NOTE>IT is my intention, for the
more ready comprehen&s;ion of the whole &s;ubject, to divide it into three
periods. The fir&s;t, from my appointment to the command, to the end of my
pur&s;uit of the enemy from Ticonderoga; the &s;econd, from that time to the
pa&s;&s;age of the Hud&s;on's River; and the third to the &s;igning the
convention.</P>
<P>I left London on the 27th of March, and upon my departure from
Plymouth, finding the Albion man of war ready to &s;ail for New-York, I wrote
to Sir W. Howe by that conveyance, upon the &s;ubject of my expedition, and the
nature of my orders. I arrived at Quebec the 6th of May. Sir Guy Carleton
immediately put under my command the troops de&s;tined for the expedition, and
committed to my management the preparatory arrangements. From thence I wrote a
&s;econd letter to Sir William Howe, wherein I repeated that I was entru&s;ted
with the command of the army de&s;tined to march from Canada, and that my
orders were to force a junction with his excellency.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed al&s;o my wi&s;hes, 
<Q REND="inline">"that a latitude had been left me for a
diver&s;ion to|wards Connecticut, but that &s;uch an idea being out of
que&s;tion, by my orders being preci&s;e to force the junction, it was only
mentioned to introduce the idea &s;till re&s;ting upon my mind; viz. to give
the change to the enemy if I could, and by every feint in my power to
e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;u&s;picion, that I &s;till pointed towards
Connecticut."</Q></P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"But," I repeated, "that under the pre&s;ent
preci&s;ion of my orders, I &s;hould really have no view but that of joining
him, nor think my&s;elf ju&s;tified by any temp|tation to delay the mo&s;t
expeditious means I could find to effect that purpo&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>I proceeded to Montreal on the 12th, and as my letters, lately
laid before the hou&s;e from that place,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix
No. V.</NOTE> and from Quebec, will &s;hew the &s;tate of things, I &s;hould
not re&s;t a moment upon this period, were it not to add one more public
te&s;timony, to tho&s;e I am not con&s;cious of having omitted upon any
occa&s;ion, of the a&s;&s;iduous and cordial manner in which the different
&s;ervices were forwarded by Sir Guy Carleton. I &s;hould think it as
di&s;honourable to &s;eek, as I know it would be impo&s;&s;ible to find
excu&s;e for any fault of mine in any failure on the part of Sir Guy Carleton,
or of any per|&s;ons who acted under him, in any matter re&s;pecting the
expedition. Had that officer been acting for him&s;elf, or for his brother, he
could not have &s;hewn more indefatigable zeal than he did, to comply with and
expedite my requi&s;itions and de&s;ires.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="14"> Certain parts of the expected force,
neverthele&s;s, fell &s;hort. The Canadian troops, &s;tated in the plan at
2000, con&s;i&s;ted only of three companies, intended to be of 100 men each,
but in reality not amounting to more than 150 upon the whole; nor could they be
augmented. The corv&eacute;es, which are detachments of provincials without
arms, to repair roads, convey provi&s;ions, or any other temporary employ|ments
for the king's &s;ervice, could not be obtained in &s;ufficient number, nor
kept to their employments, although Sir Guy Carleton u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible
exertion and en|couragement for the purpo&s;e. Drivers for the provi&s;ion
carts, and other carriages, could not be fully &s;upplied by the contractor,
though no expence was &s;pared; a circum&s;tance which occa&s;ioned much
inconvenience afterwards.</P>
<P>To the&s;e unavoidable di&s;appointments were added the
difficulties occa&s;ioned by bad weather, which rendered the roads almo&s;t
impracticable at the carrying places, and con&s;equently the pa&s;&s;age of the
batteaux, artillery, and baggage exceedingly dilatory: we had be&s;ides a great
deal of contrary wind. Notwith&s;tanding all impediments the army a&s;&s;embled
between the 17th and 20th of June, at Cumberland Point, upon Lake
Champlain.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t I held a conference with the Iroquois, Algonchins,
Abenekies, and Outawas, Indians, in all about four hundred.</P>
<P>This conference appears in your papers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See
Appendix No. VI.</NOTE>. I thought at the time that the cordiality of the
Indians over the whole continent might be depended upon, and their fir&s;t
operations tended to per&s;uade me into a belief of their utility. The prie&s;t
to whom they &s;eemed devoted, and the Briti&s;h officers employed to conduct
them, and to who&s;e controul they engaged to &s;ubmit, gained advantages, and
&s;pread terror without bar|barity. The fir&s;t party &s;ent out made &s;everal
of the enemy pri&s;oners in the heat of action, and treated them with European
humanity.</P>
<P>During the movement of the different corps to this general
rendezvous, I wrote a third letter to Sir William Howe. The chief purport of it
was to give him 
<Q REND="inline">"intelli|gence of my &s;ituation at the time, and
of my expectation of being before Ticonderoga between the 20th and 25th
in&s;tant; that I did not apprehend the effective &s;trength of the army would
amount to above 6500 men; that I meant to apply to Sir Guy Carleton to &s;end a
garri&s;on to Ticonderoga when it &s;hould be reduced, but that I was
apprehen&s;ive he would not think him&s;elf authori&s;ed by the King's orders
to comply; that whenever, therefore, I might be able to effect the junction,
Sir William would not expect me to bring near the original number. I repeated
my per&s;everance in the idea of giving jealou&s;y on the &s;ide of
Connecticut, and at the &s;ame time my a&s;&s;urances, that I &s;hould make no
manoeuvre that could procra&s;tinate the great object of a junction."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;tate the&s;e different letters to Sir William Howe merely to
&s;hew that my concep|tion of the preci&s;ion of my orders was not upon
after-thought, and taken up as an <PB N="8" REF="15"> excu&s;e when I found the
expedition had failed; but a fixed decided &s;entiment coeval with my knowledge
of my command.</P>
<P>For a further proof of the &s;ame fact, I beg leave to &s;tate an
extract from my orders to the army at Crown Point, June 30th. The words were
the&s;e.</P>
<P> 
<Q REND="inline">"The army embarks to-morrow to approach the enemy.
The &s;ervices required of this particular expedition are critical and
con&s;picuous. During our progre&s;s oc|ca&s;ions may occur, in which, nor
difficulty, nor labour, nor life are to be regarded. This army mu&s;t not
retreat."</Q> Were it nece&s;&s;ary, I could bring abundant collateral proof to
the &s;ame effect, and &s;hew that the idea of forcing a way to Albany by
vi|gorous exertions again&s;t any oppo&s;ition we might meet, was general and
fixt through the whole army.</P>
<P>My proceedings from the time of a&s;&s;embling the army as before
de&s;cribed, to the date of my public di&s;patch from Skene&s;borough,
comprehending the manoeuvres which forced the enemy from Ticondenoga, and the
actions at Skene&s;borough, Hu|berton, and Fort Anne, are related at full in
that di&s;patch.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix No. VII.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to give the Committee further
trouble upon this &s;ubject, be|cau&s;e I believe no enemy can be found to
arraign my conduct in tho&s;e days of &s;uc|ce&s;s; or if there were one, he
could not deprive me of the con&s;olation, that I had his Maje&s;ty's full
approbation and applau&s;e, of which it is known to many, I had a very
honourable and di&s;tingui&s;hed proof.</P>
<P>All therefore that is nece&s;&s;ary before I quit this fir&s;t
period of the campaign, is to give a preci&s;e &s;tate of the effective
&s;trength of the army, at the time it a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t July, the day we encamped before Ticonderoga, the

<P>In regard to the artillery, I think this the proper place to
rectify the mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions that have prevailed re&s;pecting the
quantity employed. It has been &s;tated as far beyond the nece&s;&s;ary
proportion for the number of troops, an incumbrance to their movements, and one
cau&s;e of what has been called the &s;low progre&s;s of the expedition.</P>
<P>In order to ju&s;tify this charge, a view of the whole ma&s;s has
been pre&s;ented to the public without any explanation of its di&s;tinct
allotments; and many have been led to believe, that the whole was attached to
the army throughout the campaign, and <PB N="9" REF="16"> fell into the enemy's
hands at la&s;t&mdash;The intention of this repre&s;entation is obvious: the
allegation is fal&s;e.</P>
<P>The facts, as I &s;hall prove them to the committee, are as
follow. The whole origi|nal train furni&s;hed by Sir Guy Carleton con&s;i&s;ted
of &s;ixteen heavy twenty-four poun|ders; ten heavy twelve-pounders; eight
medium twelve-pounders; two light twenty-four pounders; one light
twelve-pounder; twenty-&s;ix light &s;ix pounders; &s;eventeen light
three-pounders; &s;ix eight-inch howitzers; &s;ix five and a half inch
howitzers; two thirteen-inch mortars; two ten-inch mortars; &s;ix eight-inch
mortars; twelve five and a half-inch mortars; and twenty-four four and two
fifth-inch mortars. Of the&s;e two heavy twenty-four pounders were &s;ent on
board a &s;hip for the defence of Lake Champlain, and the other fourteen were
&s;ent back to St. John's. Of the heavy twelve-pounders, &s;ix were left at
Ticonderoga, four ditto in the Royal George; four medium twelve-pounders at
Fort George; one light twelve-pounder at Ticonderoga; two light &s;ix-pounders
at Fort George; four light &s;ix-pounders at St. John's; four light
three-pounders at Ticonderoga; five light three-pounders at St. John's; two
eight-inch howitzers at Fort George; two ditto at St. John's; two five and a
half inch ho|witzers at Fort George; two thirteen-inch mortars in the Royal
George; two ten-inch mortars in ditto; four eight-inch mortars in ditto; four
five and a half inch mortars at Ticonderoga; four royal mortars in the Royal
George; twelve cohorns at Ticon|deroga; and eight cohorns in the Royal
George.</P>
<P>The field-train therefore that proceeded with the army
con&s;i&s;ted of four medium twelve-pounders; two light twenty-four pounders;
eighteen light &s;ix-pounders; &s;ix light three-pounders; two eight-inch
howitzers; four five and a half-inch howitzers; two eight-inch mortars, and
four royals.</P>
<P>The carrying the twenty-four pounders (though they were but two)
has been &s;poken of as an error, and it is nece&s;&s;ary therefore to inform
the committee that they were of a con&s;truction lighter by 800 weight than
medium twelves, and to all intents and purpo&s;es field artillery.</P>
<P>This artillery was di&s;tributed as follows. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>Fra&s;er's corps, e&s;timated at three battalions. Ten
pieces, viz. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>Four light &s;ix-pounders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Four light three-pounders, con&s;tructed for being
occa&s;ionally carried on hor&s;eback.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Two royal howitzers.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>German re&s;erve, under Colonel Breyman, e&s;timated at two
battalions. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>Two light &s;ix-pounders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Two light three-pounders, and &s;erved by the He&s;&s;e
Hanau artillery men.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
<ITEM>The line of Briti&s;h, four battalions</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="10" REF="17">Germans, five battalions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Total, nine battalions.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Three brigades of artillery, of four &s;ix-pounders each; viz. one
brigade for each wing, and one for the center.</P>
<P>From hence it appears that to fourteen battalions there were
allotted twenty-&s;ix pieces of light artillery. The cu&s;tomary allotment is
two pieces per battalion, con|&s;equently the proportion of artillery was
le&s;s than upon common &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The forming artillery into brigades, in preference to detaching
two guns to each bat|talion, has been con&s;tantly practi&s;ed in mo&s;t
&s;ervices during la&s;t war under the able&s;t men, and it is productive of
many advantages, as the brigades by that means, either &s;ingly or united, fall
under the command of a proportionable number of officers. The &s;ervice is
carried on with greater regularity, and the effect of the fire becomes much
more formidable than when &s;cattered along the front of the line.</P>
<P>This mode of &s;ervice was recommended by Major-general Phillips,
and adopted without he&s;itation by me, my own judgment being confirmed by an
officer of his great &s;kill and experience.</P>
<P>The park artillery con&s;i&s;ted of ten pieces, viz. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>2 light twenty-four pounders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 medium twelve-pounders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 eight-inch howitzers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 royal howitzers.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I under&s;tood this proportion of field artillery to be the &s;ame
as that propo&s;ed by Sir Guy Carleton had he commanded; it was the proportion
recommended by General Phillips, and I formed my opinion conformably to the
&s;entiments of tho&s;e re&s;pectable officers upon the following rea&s;ons,
viz. that artillery was extremely for|midable to raw troops; that in a country
of po&s;ts it was e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary again&s;t the be&s;t troops;
that it was yet more applicable to the enemy we were to combat, becau&s;e the
mode of defence they invariably adopted, and at which they were be|yond all
other nations expert, was that of entrenchment covered with &s;trong abbatis,
again&s;t which the cannon, of the nature of the heavie&s;t above de&s;cribed,
and howit|zers might often be effectual, when to di&s;lodge them by any other
means might be attended with continued and important lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In the&s;e general ideas of the u&s;e of artillery again&s;t the
rebel forces, I have the happine&s;s to ob&s;erve, from the papers before you,
the concurrence of Sir William Howe, who &s;tates &s;imilar ideas very fully in
one of his requi&s;itions to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate: but further rea&s;ons
for not dimini&s;hing the proportion of guns of &s;uperior calibre to
&s;ix-pounders in this train, were, fir&s;t, their u&s;e again&s;t
block-hou&s;es (a &s;pecies of fortification peculiar to America); &s;econdly,
a probability that gun-boats might be requi&s;ite for the &s;ecurity of the
water tran&s;port, on &s;ome parts of the <PB N="11" REF="18"> Hud&s;on's
River; but principally the intention of fortifying a camp at Albany, in ca&s;e
I &s;hould reach that place, &s;hould meet with a &s;ufficiency of provi&s;ion
there, (as I was led to expect) and &s;hould find it expedient to pa&s;s the
winter there, without communication with New-York.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the quantity of ammunition attached to this
artillery, it is to be ob&s;erved, that the number of rounds accompanying the
light pieces, and which were carried in &s;mall carts, were not more than
&s;ufficient for a day's action.

</TABLE></P>
<P>The different re&s;erves of ammunition were chiefly conveyed by
water in &s;cows and batteaux; it certainly would not have been advi&s;able,
after a communica|tion with Canada was at an end, to depend upon precarious
&s;upplies from the &s;outh|ward, and therefore it became nece&s;&s;ary (as far
as the &s;ervice would allow) to carry forward &s;uch &s;tores, as there was
every appearance of an ab&s;olute want of, during the cour&s;e of an active
campaign.</P>
<P>Had the enemy e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in force upon the
i&s;lands at the mouth of the Mohawk river, or on other ground equally
advantageous, to have di&s;puted the pa&s;&s;age of that, or of the Hud&s;on's
River, or had they even waited an a&s;&s;ault in their works at Still-Water, it
is probable, that recour&s;e mu&s;t have been had to artillery of the heavier
nature; in the latter ca&s;e e&s;pecially they mu&s;t have been u&s;ed in order
to derive any advantage from our &s;eizing a po&s;t upon their left flank: I
have &s;ince known, that they had iron twelve and nine-pounders mounted upon
tho&s;e works, which were in other re&s;pects very formidable.

<P>Add the&s;e numbers to the former &s;tate of the army, and it will
be found, that the regular &s;trength when at the greate&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of
7213.</P>
<P>I come now to the &s;econd period of the campaign, comprehending
the tran&s;actions from the time the pur&s;uit of the enemy from Ticonderoga
cea&s;ed, and the corps of Brigadier-general Fra&s;er, and the 9th regiment,
rejoined the army, after the re&s;pec|tive actions of Huberton and Fort Anne,
to the time when the army pa&s;&s;ed the Hud|&s;on's river to attack the enemy
near Still-Water.</P>
<P>It had proved impo&s;&s;ible immediately to follow the quick
retreat of the enemy farther, from the nature of the country, and the
nece&s;&s;ity of waiting a fre&s;h &s;upply <PB N="12" REF="19"> of
provi&s;ions. But it appeared evident to me, that could a rapid progre&s;s
towards Albany be effected, during their di&s;per&s;ion and panic, it would be
deci&s;ive on the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion has been made by tho&s;e who began at this period to
arraign my military conduct, whether it would not have been more expedient for
the purpo&s;e of rapidity, to have fallen back to Ticonderoga, in order to take
the convenient route by Lake George, than to have per&s;evered in the laborious
and difficult cour&s;e by land to Fort Edward? My motives for preferring the
latter were the&s;e: I con&s;idered not only the general impre&s;&s;ions which
a retrograde motion is apt to make upon the minds both of enemies and friends,
but al&s;o, that the natural conduct of the enemy in that ca&s;e would be to
remain at Fort George, as their retreat could not then be cut off, in order to
oblige me to open trenches, and con&s;equently to delay me, and in the mean
time they would have de&s;troyed the road from Fort George to Fort Ed|ward. On
the other hand, by per&s;i&s;ting to penetrate by the &s;hort cut from Fort
Anne, of which I was then ma&s;ter, to Fort Edward, though it was attended with
great labour, and many alert &s;ituations, the troops were improved in the very
e&s;&s;en|tial point of wood &s;ervice; I effectually di&s;lodged the enemy
from Fort George without a blow; and &s;eeing me ma&s;ter of one communication,
they did not think it worth while to de&s;troy the other.</P>
<P>The great number of boats al&s;o, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
have been employed for the tran&s;port of the troops over Lake George, were by
this cour&s;e &s;pared for the tran&s;port of the provi&s;ion, artillery, and
ammunition.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s an&s;wered this rea&s;oning in every point; for by
the vigilance of Gene|neral Phillips, to whom I had committed the important
part of forwarding all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries from Ticonderoga, a great
embarkation arrived at Fort George on July 29th. I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the country near Fort Edward on the &s;ame day, and independently of other
advantages, I found my&s;elf much more forward in point of time than I could
po&s;&s;ibly have been by the other route.</P>
<P>Another material motive, which could not be known by &s;trangers
who have rea|&s;oned upon this movement, was, that during the time that my army
was employed in clearing Wood-Creek and cutting roads, and the corps under
Major-general Phillips working to pa&s;s the tran&s;ports over Lake George, I
was enabled to detach a large corps to my left, under Major-general Reide&s;el,
and thereby a&s;&s;i&s;t my pur|po&s;e of giving jealou&s;y to Connecticut, and
keeping in check the whole country called the Hamp&s;hire Grants.</P>
<P>It was at this time Major-general Reide&s;el conceived the
purpo&s;e of mounting his regiment of dragoons. In the country he traver&s;ed
during his detached command, he found the people frightened and
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive. He was indu&s;trious and expert in <PB N="13" REF="20">
procuring intelligence in parts of the country more remote than Bennington, and
entertained no doubt of &s;ucce&s;s, were an expedition formed under the
command of Lieutenant-colonel Baum.</P>
<P>On the arrival of the army at Fort Edward, the great object of
attention was the tran&s;ports from Fort George. The di&s;tance was about
&s;ixteen miles, the roads wanting great repair, the weather unfavourable, the
cattle and carriages &s;carce; part of the latter inconvenience was
occa&s;ioned by the number of both that were nece&s;&s;arily detained at
Ticonderoga, for the purpo&s;e of dragging the boats and the provi&s;ions over
the carrying places, between Lake Champlain and Lake George; another part of
the inconvenience was cau&s;ed by the unavoidable delays, in bringing the
different divi&s;ions of hor&s;es as they were collected in Canada through the
de&s;art, for &s;uch mo&s;t of the country is between St. John's and
Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon found, that in the &s;ituation of the tran&s;port
&s;ervice at that time, the army could barely be victualled from day to day,
and that there was no pro&s;pect of e&s;tabli&s;hing a magazine in due time for
pur&s;uing pre&s;ent advantages. The idea of the expedition to Bennington
originated upon this difficulty, combined with the in|telligence reported by
General Reide&s;el, and with all I had otherwi&s;e received.</P>
<P>I knew that Bennington was the great depo&s;it of corn, flour, and
&s;tore cattle; that it was guarded only by militia; and every day's account
tended to confirm the per&s;ua&s;ion of the loyalty of one de&s;cription of the
inhabitants and the panic of the other. Tho&s;e who knew the country be&s;t
were the mo&s;t &s;anguine in this per|&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>Had my intelligence been wor&s;e founded, I &s;hould not have
he&s;itated to try this ex|pedition with &s;uch troops, and under &s;uch
in&s;tructions as I gave to the commanding officer, for &s;o great a purpo&s;e
as that of a &s;upply &s;ufficient to enable the army to follow at the heels of
a broken and di&s;concerted enemy. The German troops employed were of the
be&s;t I had of that nation. The number of Briti&s;h was &s;mall; but it was
the &s;elect light corps of the army, compo&s;ed of cho&s;en men from all the
regiments, and commanded by Captain Fra&s;er, one of the mo&s;t
di&s;tingui&s;hed officers in his line of &s;er|vice that ever I met with. The
in&s;tructions recommended the utmo&s;t caution re&s;pect|ing po&s;ts and
&s;ecurity of retreat, attention again&s;t expo&s;ing the &s;olid part of the
detach|ment to affront, or committing it in any in&s;tance, without a moral
certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. I touch with tenderne&s;s and with great reluctance
points that relate to the dead. My defence compels me to &s;ay, my cautions
were not ob&s;erved, nor the reinforcement ad|vanced with the alacrity I had a
right to expect. The men who commanded in both in&s;tances were brave and
experienced officers. I have ever imputed their failure partly to delu&s;ion in
re&s;pect to the enemy, and partly to &s;urpri&s;e and con&s;equent confu&s;ion
in the troops.</P>
<P>For further explanation of my motives, and the circum&s;tances
attending the con|duct <PB N="14" REF="21"> of the expedition, I beg leave to
refer the committee to the letter laid before the hou&s;e la&s;t year, and more
particularly to the private letter laid before the hou&s;e lately.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix No. VIII.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;ame letter will &s;hew the only re&s;ource that remained
for proceeding towards Albany, after the di&s;appointment of this expedition,
viz. to pre&s;s forward a nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply of provi&s;ion, and other
indi&s;pen&s;ible articles, from Fort George. I &s;hall bring proof to your bar
to this point, and I tru&s;t I &s;hall &s;hew beyond a doubt, that no
po&s;|&s;ible exertion was omitted. It is not uncommon for gentlemen,
unacquainted with the peculiarities of the country to which I am alluding, to
calculate the tran&s;port of magazines, by mea&s;uring the di&s;tance upon a
map, and then applying the re&s;ources of carriage, as practi&s;ed in other
countries. I reque&s;t permi&s;&s;ion to &s;hew their mi&s;take. The fir&s;t
&s;tage from Fort George to Fort Edward is by land. The di&s;tance and the
roads were de&s;cribed before. At Fort Edward the Hud&s;on's River becomes
navigable for a certain extent, and it is the con&s;tant practice in all
tran&s;ports to re&s;ume the water carriage. Were it not, new impediments would
ari&s;e from hills, wor&s;e roads, and &s;uch an increa&s;ed di&s;tance, as
would prevent the cattle returning to Fort George the &s;ame day. About &s;ix
miles below Fort Edward lie the falls of Fort Miller, where there is another
carrying-place, which, though of no con&s;iderable length, makes it
nece&s;&s;ary to unload the boats, to place the contents in carts, and to
replace them in fre&s;h boats, at the place the river again admits of
navigation. The boats unloaded, return to Fort Edward again&s;t a rapid
&s;tream.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;hort &s;tate of facts, gentlemen will judge of our
embarra&s;&s;ments. In the fir&s;t place, it was nece&s;&s;ary to bring forward
to Fort Edward four&s;core or a hun|dred boats, as mere carriage-ve&s;&s;els
for the provi&s;ions, each boat made a hard day's work for &s;ix or more
hor&s;es, including the return of the hor&s;es. At the next carry|ing-place, as
above de&s;cribed, it was nece&s;&s;ary to place a con&s;iderable relay of
hor&s;es to draw over, fir&s;t, a portion of carriage boats, and afterwards the
provi&s;ion, as it arrived. I have not mentioned the great number of other
boats nece&s;&s;ary to be brought forward, to form bridges, to carry baggage
and ammunition, and the num|ber of carriages framed to tran&s;port the boats
them&s;elves at the en&s;uing carrying-places, as we &s;hould proceed to
Albany. This will be &s;hewn in detail at the bar, if the committee chu&s;e to
hear it; and I pledge my&s;elf, it will appear, that the dili|gence in this
&s;ervice was extreme; that it was performed in the mo&s;t expeditious manner
po&s;&s;ible, regard being had to our re&s;ources, and that no delay was
occa&s;ioned by the artillery, becau&s;e the hor&s;es appropriated to it were
&s;upernumerary to tho&s;e for which we had carts, and the artillery, not
already with the army, at la&s;t was all brought up by its own hor&s;es in two
days.</P>
<P>On the 13th of September, the &s;tore of provi&s;ion, amounting to
about thirty day's con&s;umption, was completed. I have &s;tated, in my letter
to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, my rea&s;ons again&s;t proceeding with le&s;s
quantity. And it is now time to enter upon <PB N="15" REF="22"> the
con&s;ideration of that object, which is held by &s;ome to be conclu&s;ive upon
the executive part of the campaign, the pa&s;&s;age of the Hud&s;on's
River.</P>
<P>Two errors, re&s;pecting this pa&s;&s;age, though of oppo&s;ite
and incompatible natures, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have contributed to the ill
&s;ucce&s;s that en&s;ued; the one, the error of delay, the other, that of
precipitation. In defence again&s;t the fir&s;t, I refer to my effort at
Bennington to procure &s;upplies, and to the impediments, I have ju&s;t now
&s;tated, after that effort failed. Again&s;t the latter, I refer to the
rea&s;ons laid down in my private letter to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, dated
20th of Augu&s;t. 
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Appendix No. IX.</NOTE>The &s;tate of
things at this important cri&s;is, and my rea&s;oning upon it, are
expre&s;&s;ed &s;till more at large in my di&s;patch from Albany; I will now
only touch them &s;hortly. On the one hand, my communications were at an end;
my retreat was in&s;ecure; the enemy was collected in force; they were
&s;trongly po&s;ted; Colonel St. Leger was retiring from Fort Stanwix. The&s;e
were difficulties, but none of them in&s;urmountable. On the other hand, I had
di&s;lodged the enemy repeatedly, when before in force, and more &s;trongly
po&s;ted; my army was con&s;cious of having the &s;uperiority, and eager to
advance; I expected co-operation; no letters from Sir William Howe removed that
expectation; that to Sir Guy Carleton had never weighed upon my mind, becau&s;e
it was dated early in April, and con&s;equently long before the &s;ecretary of
&s;tate's in&s;tructions, which I mu&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed to relate to
co-ope|ration, could be received. The letter of 17th July,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">No. X.</NOTE> mentioned that General's re|turn to my
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;hould Wa&s;hington turn his force towards me; indicated,
as I thought, an expectation of my arrival at Albany; and informed me, that Sir
Henry Clinton was left at New-York, and would act as occurrences might direct.
I did <HI>not</HI> know Sir Henry Clinton's force. I <HI>did</HI> know, that
con&s;iderable reinforcement might be then expected at New-York from England.
After all, &s;hould co-opera|tion from below fail, the whole force of Colonel
St. Leger, and Sir William John|&s;on, was to be expected from above, in time
to facilitate a retreat, though not in time to a&s;&s;i&s;t my advance. Under
the&s;e different &s;ugge&s;tions, and tho&s;e that are more copiou&s;ly
&s;tated in the di&s;patch, to which I have referred, I read again my orders (I
believe for an hundredth time) and I was decided.</P>
<P>And I am &s;till convinced, that no proof that could have been
brought from ap|pearances, intelligence or rea&s;oning, could have ju&s;tified
me to my country, have &s;aved me from the condemnation of my profe&s;&s;ion,
or produced pardon within my own brea&s;t, had I not advanced, and tried a
battle with the enemy.</P>
<P>I will conclude this &s;ubject, with again a&s;&s;erting upon my
honour, what I hope to &s;upport by evidence, though it is impo&s;&s;ible to
bring po&s;itive proof to a nega|tive, that neither General Fra&s;er, nor
General Phillips, ever offered, as has been re|ported, nor can be &s;uppo&s;ed
to have conceived any objection again&s;t the pa&s;&s;age of the Hud&s;on's
River.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="23"> This re&s;olution being taken, I tru&s;t, the
manner of approaching the enemy, when explained by witne&s;&s;es, will not be
di&s;graceful to me as a &s;oldier. The action, which en&s;ued on the 19th of
September, verified my opinion of the valour of my army; and I mu&s;t, in
truth, acknowledge, a very re&s;pectable &s;hare of that quality in the army of
the enemy. To the general de&s;cription given in my di&s;patch, it will be fit
to add, by evidence, the peculiar merits of the troops in that action. The
ho|nour of three Briti&s;h regiments, in continual and clo&s;e fire for four
hours, all of them &s;uffering con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and one remaining with
le&s;s than &s;ixty men, and four or five officers, ought not to lo&s;e its due
applau&s;e, becau&s;e it is &s;aid, their opponents were irregulars and
militia.</P>
<P>A victory was at la&s;t obtained, but the clo&s;e of day
unavoidably prevented any immediate advantages. On the day following, it was
known from pri&s;oners and de|&s;erters, that the enemy were in a po&s;t
&s;trongly fortified; but from the thickne&s;s of the wood, it was
impo&s;&s;ible to catch a view of any part of their po&s;ition. All that could
be done, therefore, was to take up ground as near them, as the nature of the
country would admit with regard to military arrangement. It appears from the
di&s;|patch already alluded to, that the army remained in this po&s;ition till
the 9th of Octo|ber, when the &s;econd action en&s;ued, employed in fortifying
their camp, and watch|ing the enemy, who&s;e numbers it was now known, had been
greatly &s;uperior to ours in the action.</P>
<P>It may here be a&s;ked, why, as &s;oon as it became palpable that
no u&s;e could be made of the victory, I did not retreat?</P>
<P>It will be &s;hewn, that on the &s;econd day after the action, I
received intelligence from Sir Henry Clinton, of his intention to attack the
highlands about that time, and I was hourly in expectation, I thought a
ju&s;tly founded one, of that mea&s;ure operating to di&s;lodge Mr. Gates
entirely, or to oblige him to detach a large portion of his force. Either of
the&s;e ca&s;es would probably have opened my way to Albany. In the&s;e
circum&s;tances, could the preference upon the&s;e alternatives admit of a
mo|ment's reflection? To wait &s;o fair a pro&s;pect of effecting at la&s;t the
great purpo&s;e of the campaign, or to put a victorious army, under all the
di&s;advantages of a beat|en one, by a difficult and di&s;graceful retreat;
relinqui&s;hing the long expected co-operation, in the very hour of its
promi&s;e, and leaving Sir Henry Clinton's army, and probably Sir William
Howe's, expo&s;ed, with &s;o much of the &s;ea&s;on of the cam|paign to run, to
the whole force of Mr. Gates, after he &s;hould have &s;een me on the other
&s;ide of Hud&s;on's River.</P>
<P>Some of the &s;ame con&s;iderations, and other concomitant
circum&s;tances, will, in part, &s;erve to account for my not attacking the
enemy during this interval; for in this &s;ituation, as in former ones, my
conduct has been arraigned upon oppo&s;ite principles.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24"> The committee will ob&s;erve, that after
receiving intelligence of Sir Henry Clinton's de&s;ign, different
me&s;&s;engers were di&s;patched by different routes, to inform that officer of
my &s;ituation, and of the time I thought I could continue in it. To have
hazarded a repul&s;e, under &s;o rea&s;onable an expectation of a powerful
diver&s;ion, would, in my opinion, have been very unju&s;tifiable; but when I
add, that from the backwardne&s;s, or defection, of the few Indians that
remained, the numbers of rifle-men, and other irregulars employed on the
enemy's out-po&s;ts, and the &s;trength and darkne&s;s of the &s;urrounding
woods, it had not yet been practicable to gain any competent knowledge of their
po&s;ition, I tru&s;t every man will go with me in the &s;entiment, that all
the&s;e circum&s;tances con&s;idered, an attack would have been con&s;ummate
ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>Another very powerful rea&s;on, that operated on the &s;ide of
delay, was the &s;tate of my &s;ick and wounded. Numbers of the latter were
recovering fa&s;t; many excellent officers in particular; and the more I
delayed the &s;tronger I grew. The time al&s;o en|titled me to expect
Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger's corps would be arrived at Ticon|deroga, and
&s;ecret means had been long concerted to enable him to make an effort to join
me, with probability of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon mature con&s;ideration of the&s;e and other circum&s;tances
attending this period, come to my knowledge &s;ince, I am clearly of opinion,
that had the reinforcements from England arrived in time, to have enabled Sir
Henry Clinton to have effected the &s;troke he afterwards &s;o gallantly made
in the highlands, any time between the two actions, I &s;hould have made my
way.</P>
<P>The di&s;patch alluded to, proceeds to &s;tate the rea&s;on that
induced me to make the movement on the 7th October. I &s;hall only add, to
obviate a &s;uppo&s;ed error, in not advancing my whole line, that the part
remaining in my camp, operated as effectually to keep the enemy's right wing in
check, from &s;upporting their left, as if it had moved, with this additional
advantage, that it prevented the danger of their ad|vancing by the plain, near
the river, and falling upon my rear.</P>
<P>I have rea&s;on to believe my di&s;appointment on that day
proceeded from an uncom|mon circum&s;tance in the conduct of the enemy. Mr.
Gates, as I have been informed, had determined to receive the attack in his
lines; Mr. Arnold, who commanded on the left, for&s;eeing the danger of being
turned, advanced without con&s;ultation with his ge|neral, and gave, in&s;tead
of receiving battle. The &s;troke might have been fatal on his part had he
failed. But confident I am, upon minute examination of the ground &s;ince, that
had the other idea been pur&s;ued, I &s;hould in a few hours have gained a
po|&s;ition, that in &s;pite of the enemy's numbers, would have put them in my
power.</P>
<P>Di&s;agreeable as is the nece&s;&s;ity, I mu&s;t here again, in
ju&s;tice to my own army, recur to the vigour and ob&s;tinacy with which they
were fought by the enemy. A more deter|mined per&s;everance than they &s;hewed
in the attack upon the lines, though they were <PB N="18" REF="25"> finally
repul&s;ed by the corps under Lord Balcarras, I believe, is not in any
officer's experience. It will be the bu&s;ine&s;s of evidence to prove, that in
the part, where Co|lonel Breyman was killed, and the enemy penetrated, the
mi&s;chief could not be re|paired, nor under it the camp be longer tenable.</P>
<P>The tran&s;actions of the en&s;uing night, the day of the eighth,
and the whole progre&s;s of the retreat to Saratoga, will be laid before the
committee minutely in the cour&s;e of my evidence, as well as every
circum&s;tance, from the time the army arrived there to the &s;igning the
convention. I have only to premi&s;e, that, I tru&s;t, I &s;hall be able to
prove, to the &s;atisfaction of the committee, that even in this &s;ituation, I
had the chance of a favourable event. The enemy had intended to attack by the
plain of Saratoga. On the morning of the 11th, a con&s;iderable column had
actually pa&s;&s;ed the Fi&s;h Kill for that purpo&s;e during the fog, which at
that &s;ea&s;on was regular till &s;ometime after &s;un ri&s;e. The intention
was prevented taking place, by intelligence one of their generals received from
a de&s;erter, that I had a line formed behind the bru&s;h-wood, to &s;upport
the po&s;t of artillery, which was their immediate object of attack. The
general in|&s;tantly retreated his column, and prevented a general action,
which my po&s;ition, com|pared with the propo&s;ed one of the enemy, gave me
rea&s;on to hope would have been to my advantage.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e a &s;atisfactory confidence, that I &s;hall
demon&s;trate that the intelligence I &s;tated to the councils of war,
re&s;pecting the &s;trength of the enemy, did not fall &s;hort in any part, and
in &s;ome parts much exceeded my own belief, particularly on the only
po&s;&s;ible routes of my retreat; and that tho&s;e po&s;ts were not taken up
during my &s;tay at Saratoga, as has been reported, but &s;ome of them previous
to the action of the 7th, and the re&s;t immediately after it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e the whole of this by delivering at your table,
from the hands of my &s;ecre|tary, an authenticated return of the force of
General Gates, &s;igned by him&s;elf, and the truth of it will be &s;upported
from ocular te&s;timony, by every officer of the Briti&s;h army. Many of them
are now in England, and after what has been in&s;inuated, not to &s;ay charged
in this Hou&s;e, it becomes the duty of the accu&s;ers, not only to examine
clo&s;ely the officers I have called, but to produce any other witne&s;&s;es,
that in their thoughts may be qualified to &s;peak to the good or bad order of
the rebel troops, when they marched by in their pre&s;ence, and to their
behaviour, when oppo&s;ed to our troops in action.</P>
<P>I cannot clo&s;e this long tre&s;pa&s;s upon the patience of the
committee, without ex|pre&s;&s;ing one humble hope, that in forming a judgment
upon the whole, or any di&s;tinct part of the&s;e tran&s;actions, they will be
con&s;idered as they mu&s;t have appeared at the time; for, I believe, where
war is concerned, few men in command would &s;tand ac|quitted, 
<PB N="19" REF="26"> if any after-knowledge of facts and circum&s;tances were
brought in argument again&s;t deci&s;ions of the moment, and apparent
exigencies of the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I &s;ubmit all I have &s;aid, &s;ome of it, I fear, not
&s;ufficiently prepared or arranged, with true re&s;pect to the committee. I
&s;hall not mention <HI>all</HI> the di&s;advantages, under which I have
pre&s;&s;ed this bu&s;ine&s;s upon their attention. I have cau&s;e to regret
the ab|&s;ence of a mo&s;t confidential friend in Major General Phillips;
zealous advocates, I tru&s;t, in Major General Reide&s;el and Brigadier
Hamilton. Much of my vindication is in the grave with General Fra&s;er; much
with Colonel Ackland your late member. I tru&s;t my zeal, in promoting this
enquiry, as I have done, will be one mark of the &s;en&s;e I bear of the
general character of this hou&s;e; that however men may be bia&s;&s;ed by
political attachments upon common occa&s;ions, when the honour of an individual
is committed to their hands, they will alone be guided by truth and ju&s;tice.
And the next inference I &s;hould wi&s;h to be drawn, from my earne&s;tne&s;s
for a public appeal, is this; that however others may impute errors to my
conduct, I am my&s;elf con&s;cious of the rectitude of my intentions.</P>

<P>A. He did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE>Q. What was the purport of your
an&s;wer?</P> 
<P>A. That I did not think my&s;elf ju&s;tified to grant it by my

<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE>Q. Whether, when you propo&s;ed to
take that train of artillery with you that you have mentioned, it was with a
view to the reduction of the forts at Ticonderoga; or whether you propo&s;ed to
have taken with you the &s;ame train of artillery in ca&s;e you had marched
forward in the country toward Albany?</P> 
<P>A. It was with an intention to reduce the forts and lines at
Ticonderoga; the train of artillery was calculated for that &s;ervice.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">13. By Gen. Burgoyne.</NOTE>Q. Whether you
know what proportion of artillery was carried forward by the ar|my under
General Burgoyne's command after the reduction of Ticonderoga?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE>Q. Would you not, in ca&s;e you had
reduced Ticonderoga and marched forwards towards Albany, have carried with you
a train of field artillery?</P> 
<P>A. I probably &s;hould have taken artillery with me.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE>Q. Had you fore&s;een a
nece&s;&s;ity of fortifying a camp at Albany, would you not have carried &s;ome
guns of the calibre of twelve pounders and light twenty-fours?</P> 
<P>A. It is really a very difficult matter off hand to run into all
the minute operations of a campaign; every mea&s;ure of that &s;ort mu&s;t have
been a matter of con&s;ideration and deliberation, and there are a thou&s;and
circum&s;tances that might have determined me upon the &s;pot&mdash;I don't
wi&s;h to conceal from this Hou&s;e any thing that I would have done&mdash;but
I hope they will con&s;ider, that every gentleman may have different ideas of
the &s;tate and &s;ituation of the army, as expre&s;&s;ed by the que&s;tion
a&s;ked, and the lea&s;t inaccuracy of expre&s;&s;ion on my part may convey
ideas very different from what I could wi&s;h&mdash;In general, &s;o
con&s;iderable a corps as that was, very &s;eldom moves without artillery, but
the preci&s;e number mu&s;t depend on a variety of circum&s;tances, which the
di&s;cretion and judgment of the officer who commands mu&s;t determine.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE>Q. Were not the orders you received
from government po&s;itive, for General Bur|goyne to march to Albany?</P> 
<P>A. The orders have been publi&s;hed I under&s;tand&mdash;Every
gentleman in this Hou&s;e mu&s;t be a judge of tho&s;e orders whether they were
po&s;itive or not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE>Q. Did you not receive a letter,
dated the 5th of April, from Sir William Howe, informing you that he could not
&s;end any force to a&s;&s;i&s;t the operations of General Burgoyne's army?</P>

<P>A. I received a letter from Sir William Howe relative to his
operations, a copy of which was &s;ent to General Burgoyne&mdash;I think it was
not ju&s;t in tho&s;e terms, but a copy of the letter is on the table.</P> 
<P><PB N="22" REF="29"><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE>Q. Whether on
that information, you con&s;idered that you had any di&s;cretionary power to
detain General Burgoyne after that information?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE>Q. Whether in ca&s;e of any
difficulty that General Burgoyne might meet with on his march, there was any
latitude given to him (General Burgoyne) to retreat?</P> 
<P>A. I &s;aid before, that the orders were before the Hou&s;e, who
are competent to judge on that point.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE>Q. Did you your&s;elf under&s;tand
tho&s;e orders to General Burgoyne to be po&s;itive?</P> 
<P>A. That is giving an opinion upon what perhaps may be a
que&s;tion in the Hou&s;e; whereas I have already &s;aid, the Hou&s;e are as
competent to judge as I am.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE>Q. Is the Committee to under&s;tand
from that an&s;wer, that you have any objection of giving your opinion on that
que&s;tion?</P> 
<P>A. I have an objection to give an opinion on almo&s;t all
points.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE>Q. Did you give it in orders to
General Burgoyne, in ca&s;e he met with any diffi|culties during his march in
Canada, under your command, not to proceed?</P> 
<P>A. I &s;hould have taken care that General Burgoyne met with no
difficulties in his march in Canada; nor do I well &s;ee how he could.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE>Q. Where do the boundaries of the
province of Canada end?</P> 
<P>A. Between the Illinois and Point an Fer.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE>Q. Is the fortre&s;s of Ticonderoga
in Canada?</P> 
<P>A. No.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25.</NOTE>Q. Did your commi&s;&s;ion, as
commander in chief of the troops in the northern divi&s;ion, extend beyond the
boundaries of Canada to Ticonderoga?</P> 
<P>A. That commi&s;&s;ion as commander in chief, I under&s;tood,
did extend &s;o far; but by the orders already alluded to, or by tho&s;e which
General Burgoyne brought out in the &s;pring 1777, I under&s;tood that my
command was re&s;trained to the limits of the province, and that General
Burgoyne was entirely from under my command, as &s;oon as he pa&s;&s;ed the
limits of the province.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE>Q. Did you apply to the &s;ecretary
of &s;tate for a reinforcement of 4000 men, as nece&s;&s;ary for the campaign
of 1777?</P> 
<P>A. I recollect when General Burgoyne was coming home in the fall
of 1776, as I was perfectly &s;atisfied with his conduct in the preceding
campaign, I talked over with him, in confidence, what I thought nece&s;&s;ary
for the following campaign; among other things I de&s;ired him to make a
memorandum to demand 4000 men, as a reinforcement for the en&s;uing campaign,
or at lea&s;t for four battalions. I think I have &s;een tho&s;e memorandums
were accurately &s;tated and laid before the Hou&s;e.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE>Q. What part of that 4000 men which
you thought nece&s;&s;ary for the campaign of 1777, was actually &s;ent out to
Canada in that year?</P> 
<P>A. I do not accurately remember how many&mdash;I think a very
&s;mall part&mdash;You may have a very preci&s;e account from the returns.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">28.</NOTE>Q. Of that &s;mall part &s;ent in
1777, did not a certain proportion arrive very late in the year?</P> 
<P>A. Yes, a part arrived late.</P> 
<P><PB N="23" REF="30"><NOTE PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE>Q. After you
had received your orders from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, did you appre|hend
that General Burgoyne, as long as he was within the province of Canada, was
po&s;itively under your command?</P> 
<P>A. Yes, I did: as long as he was in the province of Canada, I
looked on him to be po&s;itively under my command; but the load of the
expedition being on his &s;houl|ders, I thought it proper that he, in all
things &s;hould direct; and therefore I gave out immediate orders, that not
only the troops he was to command out of the pro|vince, but all the departments
nece&s;&s;ary for the a&s;&s;i&s;ting his expedition, &s;hould comply
immediately, and without delay, with every requi&s;ition and order he &s;hould
give. The rea&s;on of my doing &s;o was, that no time might be lo&s;t. I only
required that they &s;hould report to me what orders they had received from
General Burgoyne. I believe tho&s;e orders are al&s;o on the table.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30.</NOTE>Q. Will you explain to the
Committee what you mean by the words, <HI>load of the expedition lying on
General Burgoyne's &s;houlders?</HI></P> 
<P>A. I had no particular meaning; they are words I &s;hould have
u&s;ed on any expedi|tion of importance.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">31.</NOTE>Q. If General Burgoyne had met with
very con&s;iderable difficulties to impede his progre&s;s within the province
of Canada, would you have thought your&s;elf ju&s;tifi|able in giving any
orders to General Burgoyne, different from tho&s;e tran&s;mitted to General
Burgoyne, through you, from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate?</P> 
<P>A. Had there been any difficulties in Canada, I would not have
given him up the command.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE>Q. Having given up the command to
General Burgoyne, and having ordered all the troops to obey him, only reporting
their proceedings to you, would you after that, have thought your&s;elf
ju&s;tifiable to change the order to General Burgoyne, upon his meeting with
great difficulties on the frontiers of the neighbouring pro|vinces?</P> 
<P>A. I really did not mean to evade the que&s;tion in the lea&s;t.
It did not appear to me po&s;&s;ible that there could be any difficulties. I
don't mean to &s;ay there could not, from the nature of the country, be
difficulties in the march that might occa&s;ion delay, but by the nature of the
que&s;tion I under&s;tood difficulties from the enemy. In that ca&s;e I
&s;hould not have thought my&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in giving up the command.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">33.</NOTE>Q. If you had heard, that on the
frontiers, and within the province of Canada, there was the greate&s;t rea&s;on
to think, that the re&s;i&s;tance of General Burgoyne's army was &s;o great as
to make it, in your opinion, exceedingly difficult for that General to force
his way to Albany, would you think your&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in giving different
or|ders to General Burgoyne, from tho&s;e given by the &s;ecretary of &s;tate;
or would you have thought the &s;ecretary of &s;tate's orders for General
Burgoyne's army &s;o peremp|tory that it would not be proper for you to
interfere?</P> 
<P>A. If I under&s;tood the que&s;tion as it now &s;tands, it is
what I would have done, had the province been invaded, or clo&s;e on the point
of being invaded, and the enemy entering the province.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE>Q. The que&s;tion does not mean an
invading army, but a re&s;i&s;tance from the enemy to the progre&s;s of General
Burgoyne's army, in the ca&s;e &s;tated in the la&s;t que&s;|tion?</P> 
<P><PB N="24" REF="31">A. In that ca&s;e, that an enemy &s;hould be
found (within the limits of my com|mand) I &s;hould have ordered all the troops
de&s;tined for the defence of the province, to have immediately joined tho&s;e
de&s;tined for General Burgoyne, and have rea&s;&s;um|ed the command of all,
until tho&s;e ob&s;tructions had been removed, within the limits of my
authority.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE>Q. Suppo&s;e no enemy within the
province of Canada, but po&s;ted in &s;uch a manner upon the line of
communication with Albany, as to make it exceeding difficult for General
Burgoyne to obey the orders given to him, would you think your&s;elf
ju&s;ti|fiable in giving different orders to General Burgoyne, from tho&s;e
given by the &s;e|cretary of &s;tate; or would you have thought the &s;ecretary
of &s;tate's orders for General Burgoyne's army &s;o peremptory that it would
not be proper for you to interfere?</P> 
<P>A. I could not change General Burgoyne's orders one tittle, that
was my opinion; he received his orders from the &s;ame power that gave me my
authority; when once he pa&s;&s;ed the limits of my command, I neither could
give him orders, nor would he be ju&s;tified in obeying them.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">36.</NOTE>Q. Do you mean the latter part of
that an&s;wer as an an&s;wer to a que&s;tion which &s;uppo&s;es General
Burgoyne within the limits of the province of Canada?</P> 
<P>A. No: while he was within the limits of the province of Canada,
I would have given General Burgoyne orders in all ca&s;es of difficulty and
danger. There being no &s;uch ca&s;e when General Burgoyne arrived in Canada,
in 1777, nor a po&s;|&s;ibility of an event of that &s;ort, I put the troops
and all things under his com|mand, which concerned his expedition, that he
might arrange and combine their motions according to his own plan of operation
for the campaign, that no time might be lo&s;t by any unnece&s;&s;ary
applications to me, which the &s;trict forms of my command might otherwi&s;e
require.</P></Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>

<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">37.</NOTE>Q. Should you, if you had been in
General Burgoyne's &s;ituation, and acting un|der the orders which you know he
received, have thought your&s;elf bound to pur&s;ue them implicitly, or at
liberty to deviate from them?</P> 
<P>A. I &s;hould certainly have thought my&s;elf bound to have
obeyed them to the ut|mo&s;t of my power; but, to &s;ay as a military man, that
in all ca&s;es po&s;&s;ible, I mu&s;t have gone on, is a very nice thing to
&s;ay indeed; it mu&s;t have thrown me, and I &s;uppo&s;e every officer, into a
mo&s;t unplea&s;ant and anxious &s;ituation, to have de|bated within him&s;elf,
whether he was or was not to go on. Every man mu&s;t decide for him&s;elf. What
I would have done, I really don't know; the particular &s;ituation, and a man's
own particular feelings, mu&s;t determine the point. If I might be indul|ged, I
would beg leave to &s;ay, that I did not mean to evade any que&s;tion; I meant
to an&s;wer directly; yet que&s;tions may be put to me, of &s;o delicate a
nature, and perhaps no man in the world is in a more delicate &s;ituation, with
re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e in que&s;tion, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of this
Committee, than I am; when &s;uch que&s;tions are put to me, I &s;hall pray the
indulgence of the Committee, to be excu&s;ed an&s;wering <PB N="25" REF="32">
them, but I will not evade them. As I now under&s;tand the meaning of the right
honourable member in the former que&s;tions to be, Whether I &s;hould have
taken upon me to &s;uper&s;ede the King's orders, &s;uppo&s;ing I knew of any
un&s;urmountable difficulties in the way, as that I had information of 20,000
men at Ticonderoga, before General Burgoyne left the province of Canada, I
&s;hould have told General Burgoyne my information? But it was General Burgoyne
who was to carry the orders into execution, and not me, and therefore it was
upon his own judgment he was to determine; I &s;hould have given him my
opinion, but I think I had no right to give him orders under tho&s;e
circum&s;tances.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">38.</NOTE>Q. Who was it that made the
arrangement and di&s;tribution of the troops that were to be left for the
defence of Canada, independent of tho&s;e under the command of General
Burgoyne?</P> 
<P>A. The orders that are before the Hou&s;e are very full, and I
thought very clear. The Committee will &s;ee in tho&s;e orders the troops that
were de&s;tined for General Burgoyne's expedition, and the troops that were to
remain for the defence of the province.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">39.</NOTE>Q. Who made that di&s;tribution?</P> 
<P>A. It came to me from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">42.</NOTE>Q. Was the di&s;tribution of the
troops pre&s;cribed to you by the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, or left to your

<P>A. In mentioning the number of troops which were to remain in
that province, it was there &s;aid that tho&s;e troops would be &s;ufficient
for garri&s;oning &s;uch and &s;uch places, particularizing them.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">43.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever know an in&s;tance,
in your military life, of a mini&s;ter making a di&s;tribution of troops for
the defence of a province, without taking the opinion or leaving a great deal
to the di&s;cretion of the governor of that province, that governor being an
acting military officer of very high rank?</P> 
<P>A. I never had the honour to corre&s;pond with a &s;ecretary of

General Burgoyne acted; is it your opinion that the be&s;t movement Sir William

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">50.</NOTE>Q. Whether you thought, after the

<P>A. I took it for granted, that Sir William Howe knew what he was
about, and would do what he thought be&s;t for the public &s;ervice. I really
was &s;o little in|formed of all the particular circum&s;tances of his

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the
difficulties of removing the wounded from Huberton to the ho&s;pital at

<P>A. From the di&s;tance and badne&s;s of the roads, the
difficulties attending the re|moving of the ho&s;pital mu&s;t have been very
great.</P>

the wounded had been left expo&s;ed to the enemy, to have rejoined the army

<P>A. It was not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">13.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip recollect
how the army was employed between that time and the march to Fort Edward?</P> 
<P>A. The Briti&s;h were employed in opening the country and
making roads to Fort Anne; the Germans under General Reide&s;el were detached
about fourteen miles to the left.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the po&s;t
the enemy abandoned upon the a&s;cent from the Low Country to the Pitch Pine

twenty-four hours on the &s;ame place without entrenching; and was it not
al&s;o their general practice to add abbaties to their entrenchments?</P> 
<P>A. The rebels were always indefatigable in &s;ecuring
them&s;elves by entrench|ments, and in general they added an abbatis to tho&s;e

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the po&s;ition

<P>A. I do not think it could.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE>Q. From the nature of that

<P>A. Not without greatly ri&s;quing the boats and portable

<P><PB N="29" REF="36">A. General Fra&s;er's temper was warm,

not a powerful fire of artillery from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore have been of great

<P>A. If the enemy had attacked General Fra&s;er, they would have
found him in a very bad po&s;ture; it was impo&s;&s;ible to take a better, and,
as they could not be &s;up|ported by the line, the only means of &s;afety

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE>Q. From the&s;e circum&s;tances,
and your other knowledge of the army, do you not believe that to have made no
further attempt on the enemy would have cau&s;ed di&s;|appointment and

<P>A. The troops were in the highe&s;t &s;pirits, and wi&s;hed to
be led on.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">33.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip recollect
the march up to the enemy on the morning of the 19th of September?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE>Q. Was the combination of the
march &s;uch, as, that notwith&s;tanding the pa&s;|&s;age of the ravines and
the thickne&s;s of the woods, the column of General Fra&s;er's march, and that
of the Briti&s;h line, led by General Burgoyne, were in a &s;ituation to
&s;upport each other, and &s;peedily to form in line of battle, at the time the
enemy be|gan the attack?</P> 
<P><PB N="30" REF="37">A. After the columns had pa&s;&s;ed the
ravines, they arrived at their re&s;pective po&s;ts with great preci&s;ion in
point of time, and every fortunate circum&s;tance attend|ed the forming of the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE> Q How long did that action
la&s;t?</P> 
<P>A. The Briti&s;h were attacked partially about one o'clock.
The action was gene|ral at three, and ended at &s;even o'clock.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">36.</NOTE>Q. From the nature of the

to form any judgment what attacks were in force, and what were feints?</P> 
<P>A. I think not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">37.</NOTE>Q. Did we remain ma&s;ters of the

of General Fra&s;er's corps to the out-po&s;ts of the enemy from that time to

country, and the &s;ituation of the enemy's out-po&s;ts, was it po&s;&s;ible to
reconnoitre their po&s;ition?</P> 
<P>A. From the nature of the country, the difficulties attending
reconnoitering mu&s;t have been very great.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">43.</NOTE>Q. Were not the riflemen, and
other irregulars, employed by the enemy at out-po&s;ts and on &s;couts, an
overmatch for the Indian or provincial troops that were with the army at that

<P>A. They were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">44.</NOTE>Q. Was not General Fra&s;er's

their own po&s;ts, and opening the front to oppo&s;e the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. They were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">45.</NOTE>Q. After General Fra&s;er
received his wound, on the 7th of October, on whom did the command of his corps
devolve?</P> 
<P>A. On me.</P>

that day, to ob&s;erve the general di&s;po&s;ition of the army, made by General
Burgoyne, previous to the action?</P> 
<P>A. I remember two redoubts having been erected on the left, to
cover the boats and provi&s;ions to enable General Burgoyne to make a
detachment from his army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">47.</NOTE>Q. Was you in a &s;ituation to
ob&s;erve the di&s;po&s;ition made immediately before the attack by the

<P>A. I only recollect the &s;ituation of the two battalions of
the advanced corps.</P> 
<P><PB N="31" REF="38"><NOTE PLACE="marg">48.</NOTE>Q. After the
retreat to the lines, were the lines attacked, and with what de|gree of

<P>A. The lines were attacked, and with as much fury as the fire

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">49.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip remember
that part of the lines where you commanded, being vi&s;ited by General Burgoyne
during the attack?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect to have &s;een General Burgoyne.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">50.</NOTE>Q. Was the cannon of great u&s;e
in the repul&s;e of the enemy in your po&s;t? </P> 
<P>A. Of very great u&s;e.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">51.</NOTE>Q. Do you think that po&s;t would
have been tenable next morning, the enemy having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Colonel
Briemen's po&s;t?</P> 
<P>A. I do not think it would.</P>

<P>A. It would.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">53.</NOTE>Q. Was the retreat in the night,
and the new di&s;po&s;ition of the whole army made in good order and without

<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">54.</NOTE>Q. Did the army remain under
arms, and in momentary expectation of battle, the whole of the day of the

<P>A. It did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">55.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the
confu&s;ion and difficulties attending the line of baggage in the retreat, in
the night of the 8th?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">56.</NOTE>Q. Was not the retreat
neverthele&s;s made in good order by the troops, and without lo&s;s?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">57.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip remember
the weather, the &s;tate of the roads, the &s;tate of the cattle, and the
difficulty of pa&s;&s;ing the Fi&s;h Kiln, in the retreat to Saratoga, in the
day and night of the 9th?</P> 
<P>A. It rained ince&s;&s;antly, con&s;equently the roads were
bad; the cattle were nearly &s;tarved for want of forage, and the bridge over
the Fi&s;h Kill had been de&s;troyed by the enemy; the troops were obliged to
ford the river.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">58.</NOTE>Q. Had there been no enemy to
oppo&s;e us, or no bridges or roads to repair, would it have been po&s;&s;ible,
from the &s;tate of the fatigue of the troops, to have continued the march
farther immediately after the arrival at Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. The troops were greatly fatigued, and the artillery had
been left on the other &s;ide of the Fi&s;h Kill.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">59.</NOTE>Q. Why were they left on the
other &s;ide of the Fi&s;h Kill? </P> 
<P>A. The bridge had been de&s;troyed by the enemy; it was
exceeding dark, and I do not know whether the ford was pa&s;&s;able for the
artillery without being fir&s;t exa|mined.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">60.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the enemy
opening a battery on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of Hud&s;on's River, and the
circum&s;tances attending the opening that battery?</P> 
<P><PB N="32" REF="39">A. The corps I commanded was at that time
po&s;ted, and they fired on us at that time, but I do not know from what
direction.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">61.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip remember
the &s;hot from that battery going over the table when you and &s;everal
officers were at dinner?</P> 
<P>A. I did not dine with General Burgoyne that day&mdash;I
recollect hearing a cannon &s;hot had di&s;compo&s;ed the company at the
general's table.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">62.</NOTE>Q. Con&s;equently mu&s;t not that

<P>A. I believe I &s;aid, I did not recollect from what direction
the &s;hot came, but they had a battery which commanded that ford.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">63.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect on what day
you was called, with other commanders of corps, to the fir&s;t council of
war?</P> 
<P>A. On the 13th of October.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">64.</NOTE>Q. Was there a &s;pot in the
whole po&s;ition to be found for holding that council, which was not expo&s;ed
to cannon or rifle-&s;hot?</P> 
<P>A. We were not &s;o fortunate as to find one.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">65.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect that General
Burgoyne, after &s;tating to the council the difficul|ties of the &s;ituation,
declare, that nothing &s;hould induce him to propo&s;e terms to the enemy
without the general concurrence of the generals and field officers of the army,
and that he was ready to take the lead in any mea&s;ure that they &s;hould
think for the honour of the Briti&s;h arms, or words to that effect?</P> 
<P>A. I remember words to that effect.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">66.</NOTE>Q. Was the concurrence unanimous
for treating on honourable terms?</P> 
<P>A. I hope I &s;hall &s;tand ju&s;tified with the members of
that council, when I have the honour to declare to this Hou&s;e, that our
&s;ituation appeared to them &s;o decided as not to admit of one di&s;&s;enting
voice.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">67.</NOTE>Q. When Colonel King&s;ton
brought back the fir&s;t propo&s;ition, wherein it was &s;pe|cified by Major
General Gates, that the army &s;hould lay down their arms in their
entrenchments and &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war, does your Lord&s;hip
remember, that General Burgoyne, when he read them to the council, declared, he
would not &s;et his hand to tho&s;e conditions, or words to that effect?</P> 
<P>A. I think the words of the propo&s;al from General Gates
were, That the Briti&s;h army &s;hould be ordered, by word of command from
their adjutant general, to lay down their arms in the entrenchments. It was
rejected with di&s;dain by General Bur|gone, and the council concurred in his
indignation.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">68.</NOTE>Q. Were the counter propo&s;als,
penned by General Burgoyne, unanimou&s;ly ap|proved?</P> 
<P>A. They were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">69.</NOTE>Q. When tho&s;e propo&s;als had
been agreed to by General Gates, but copies not &s;igned by either party, do
you remember General Burgoyne informing the council of intelligence he had
received from a &s;py in the night, and &s;ubmitting to their con&s;idera|tion,
whether it was con&s;i&s;tent with public faith, and if &s;o, expedient to
&s;u&s;pend the execution of the treaty and tru&s;t to events?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">70.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip recollect
what was the re&s;ult of that con&s;ideration?</P> 
<P><PB N="33" REF="40">A. The determination of the council, on

plighted.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">71.</NOTE>Q. Though that was the opinion of
the majority, was there not a difference of opi|nion in the council?</P> 
<P>A. There was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">72.</NOTE>Q. Where the opinions of the
&s;everal commanding officers a&s;ked re&s;pecting the con|dition of their
re&s;pective corps, and what might be expected from them &s;everally in

<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">73.</NOTE>Q. Was there not on that
que&s;tion al&s;o difference of opinion? </P> 
<P>A. There was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">74.</NOTE>Q. After the Convention took
place, did your Lord&s;hip &s;ee the army of General Gates pa&s;s in review
before General Burgoyne and General Phillips?</P> 
<P>A. I did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">75.</NOTE>Q. From the manner and &s;ilence
of their march, the order ob&s;erved in keeping their divi&s;ions, and an
apparent attention to their officers, did that army appear di&s;ciplined?</P> 
<P>A. They marched in good order and were &s;ilent, and &s;eemed
to pay attention to their officers. The&s;e are e&s;&s;ential points of
di&s;cipline, but I &s;aw nothing farther of it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">76.</NOTE>Q. From the general behaviour of
the rebel troops in the different actions in which you was pre&s;ent in the
cour&s;e of the campaign, did you think them di&s;ciplined and re&s;pectable
troops?</P> 
<P>A. When I an&s;wered the la&s;t que&s;tion, I &s;poke to the
manoeuvre I &s;aw upon the &s;pot. At all times when I was oppo&s;ed to the
rebels, they fought with great courage and ob&s;tinacy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">77.</NOTE>Q. Judging by your eye, and the
time the rebel army was marching in review, did you form any judgment of their
number?</P> 
<P>A. It requires great experience to make a computation of
numbers by &s;eeing them pa&s;s: as far as I could judge on the occa&s;ion,
they &s;eemed to me to amount to thir|teen or fourteen thou&s;and rank and file
under arms.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">78.</NOTE>Q. Has your Lord&s;hip rea&s;on
to know or believe, that the troops that pa&s;&s;ed in re|view were exclu&s;ive
of tho&s;e corps that had been po&s;ted on the other &s;ide of the Hud|&s;on's

<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">79.</NOTE>Q. What was the general opinion
of the army of General Burgoyne's behaviour in action and in difficulty?</P> 
<P>A. It appeared to me, that General Burgoyne always
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in every &s;ituation of danger and difficulty, and,
I may venture to &s;ay, it appeared &s;o to the army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">80.</NOTE>Q. Had General Burgoyne the

<P>A. He had.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">81.</NOTE>Q. After the arrival of the

the army &s;atisfied with the general's efforts to contribute to their comfort,
and redre&s;s their grievances?</P> 
<P>A. They were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">82.</NOTE>Q. Was the army &s;atisfied with
the general's behaviour at the court martial held on Colonel Henley?</P> 
<P>A. He carried on that pro&s;ecution in per&s;on, and as &s;uch
they were &s;atisfied with him.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">83.</NOTE>Q. Did your Lord&s;hip ever hear
any officer or &s;oldier of that army expre&s;s any di&s;&s;a|tisfaction at the
general's returning to England?</P> 
<P>A. I did not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">84.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip think
that the officers of that army wi&s;h to have their re|&s;pective merits
&s;tated to their Sovereign, by the general in per&s;on who had the honour of
commanding them?</P> 
<P>A. It was the wi&s;h of that army that General Burgoyne
&s;hould go to Europe, to ju&s;tify not only his own conduct, but the conduct
of the army he commanded.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">85.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip
apprehend, that the return of General Burgoyne to that army, under per&s;onal
di&s;grace, and without any di&s;tribution of preferment among the

to the troops under captivity?</P> 
<P>A. General Burgoyne, at all times, &s;hared the dangers and
afflictions of that army in common with every &s;oldier; as &s;uch they looked
on him as their friend, and cer|tainly would have received him in per&s;on, or

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">86.</NOTE>Q. Your Lord&s;hip having &s;aid
that if the rebels had maintained their po&s;t, at the a&s;cent from the Low

artillery would have been of great u&s;e to di&s;lodge them; will your
Lord&s;hip &s;ay what kind of artillery, of what calibre, would have been
nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e?</P> 
<P>A. Any of the artillery officers now under the order of the

Ticonderoga, had been embarked, and proceeded directly to South Bay, would
there have been any occa&s;ion to have attacked the po&s;t at Pitch Pine Plains

<P>A. The army did proceed by South Bay, excepting a detachment
of General Fra&s;er's corps, and &s;ome Germans to &s;upport him; and the army

the po&s;t at Pitch Pine Plains, in order to go to South Bay?</P> 
<P>A. They had no &s;ort of connection with each other.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">92.</NOTE>Q. Might not the army have
proceeded to Fort Edward, and omitted the attack of that pa&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ing
it had been meant to be defended?</P> 
<P><PB N="35" REF="42">A. There were two routes to Fort Edward.
General Burgoyne might &s;till go the &s;ame route without any nece&s;&s;ity of
attacking that po&s;t, as there might have been many different ways of
di&s;lodging the enemy from that po&s;t without attacking it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">93.</NOTE>Q. In how many in&s;tances do you
remember the rebels defending their entrench|ments after they had made
them?</P> 
<P>A. We never got a view of any of their entrenchments but
&s;uch as they had voluntarily abandoned.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">94.</NOTE>Q. Is it then to be under&s;tood
that they never defended any entrenchments? </P> 
<P>A. They never did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">95.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever hear General
Fra&s;er expre&s;s his approbation of the pa&s;&s;ing of the Hud&s;on's

<P>A. I never did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">96.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever hear General
Fra&s;er expre&s;s his approbation of the Bennington expedition?</P> 
<P>A. That detachment was made, and the bu&s;ine&s;s concluded,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">97.</NOTE>Q. Have you occa&s;ion to know,
when the fir&s;t detachment was &s;ent out under Co|lonel Baume, where they
were ordered to rejoin General Burgoyne, after they had per|formed the
&s;ervice they were &s;ent on?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">98.</NOTE>Q. Whether, in your Lord&s;hip's
opinion, after the lo&s;s the rebels had &s;u&s;tained over night, in the
action of the 19th of September, if they had been attacked bri&s;kly at break
of day, the next day, there was a probability that they could have &s;tood
their ground?</P> 
<P>A. I have not he&s;itated to give an opinion upon &s;uppo&s;ed
matters, which mu&s;t have been attended with evident and demon&s;trable
con&s;equences; but I beg the indulgence of the Hou&s;e in declining to give
any opinion upon any que&s;tion relative to &s;peculation or judgment. Had any
general officer of that army under General Burgoyne been pre&s;ent in this
country, I &s;hould have confined my&s;elf merely to the manoeuvres of the
corps I commanded. As there is no general officer here, I wi&s;h to give this
Hou&s;e every information con&s;i&s;tent with my rank in the army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">99.</NOTE>Q. Had you any information that
might indicate to you that the rebels were pre|pared to decamp after the action
of the 19th of September?</P> 
<P>A. I was ignorant of any &s;uch intelligence being
received.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">100.</NOTE>Q. Had you any information of
their baggage being packed up? </P> 
<P>A. I have already an&s;wered, that I had no information at all
about it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">101.</NOTE>Q. In the action of the 7th of
October, on which &s;ide did the rebels force our lines and make a
lodgement?</P> 
<P>A. The lines to the right were &s;tormed and carried.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">102.</NOTE>Q. Were the lines attacked to
the left? </P> 
<P>A. To the left of that po&s;t they were, but not to the left
of the army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">103.</NOTE>Q. Did not the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fort Edward, and the country thereabouts, cut off the
retreat of any garri&s;on that might have been in Fort George?</P> 
<P>A. It undoubtedly did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">104.</NOTE>Q. Had the army proceeded to
Fort George by Ticonderoga and Lake George, might not the enemy have remained
at Fort George till the trenches were opened, and have &s;till had their
retreat &s;ecure?</P> 
<P><PB N="36" REF="43">A. That is a matter of opinion upon
&s;peculation.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">105.</NOTE>Q. Do you not think that the
Briti&s;h army, being well provided with artillery, was a probable rea&s;on for
their not defending entrenchments?</P> 
<P>A. The rea&s;on they did not defend their entrenchments was,
that they always marched out of them and attacked us.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">106.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip think it
would have been advi&s;eable, in point of prudence, or ju&s;t to brave troops,
who had &s;uffered &s;evere lo&s;s, to attack an enemy the morning after that
lo&s;s, po&s;ted within entrenchments, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to
recon|noitre?</P> 
<P>A. That attempt was tried on the 7th of October, and did not
&s;ucceed.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">107.</NOTE>Q. Were not the enemy reinforced
between the 19th of September and the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. I think it is likely they were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">108.</NOTE>Q. Were they likely to be in
better &s;pirits to repel an attack the day after they had been repul&s;ed with
great lo&s;s, or when they had been reinforced, and &s;een an army lie three
weeks inactive in their camp?</P> 
<P>A. I do not judge of the &s;pirit of the enemy but when I was
oppo&s;ed to them my&s;elf.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">109.</NOTE>Q. On the fir&s;t day of the
action, when the enemy was repul&s;ed on the 19th of September, had not our
army &s;uffered very con&s;iderably?</P> 
<P>A. They &s;uffered very con&s;iderable lo&s;s.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">110.</NOTE>Q. Was not the army recruited,
and in better order, on the 7th of October, than they were on the 20th of
September?</P> 
<P>A. Numbers of the men who had been wounded and di&s;abled in
the action of the 19th, joined their corps on the 7th of October.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">111.</NOTE>Q. Was the behaviour of the
enemy, oppo&s;ed to your Lord&s;hip, in the actions you have &s;een, &s;uch as
to make them contemptible in the eye of a &s;oldier?</P> 
<P>A. I have already mentioned, that they fought at all times
with courage and ob|&s;tinacy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">112.</NOTE>Q. Whether the behaviour of the
enemy was &s;uch as to make advantages obtained by them over his Maje&s;ty's
troops more humiliating and di&s;graceful to the Briti&s;h arms than the &s;ame
advantages obtained by an equal number of any other troops?</P> 
<P>A. I my&s;elf felt more humiliation until I con&s;idered that
tho&s;e advantages proceeded from the nature of the country, and not from the
want of zeal or bravery in the Bri|ti&s;h troops.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">113.</NOTE>Q. Whether the enemy's troops
were &s;uch bad troops as to make it more di&s;graceful to have an advantage
obtained by them over the King's troops than by the like number of any other
enemy over a like number of his Maje&s;ty's troops in the &s;ame
circum|&s;tances of country?</P> 
<P>A. The advantages gained by the rebels over the Briti&s;h
troops proceeded from their local &s;ituation, and not from the want of courage
in the Briti&s;h troops. We were taught by experience that neither their
attacks nor re&s;i&s;tance was to be de|&s;pi&s;ed.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">114.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever &s;erve
again&s;t any other troops?</P> 
<P>A. I commenced my &s;ervice in America.</P> 
<P><PB N="37" REF="44"><NOTE PLACE="marg">115.</NOTE>Q. Whether
the army under General Burgoyne, in general, expected co-operation in their
efforts to go to Albany, from the army under the command of Sir William
Howe?</P> 
<P>A. General Burgoyne gave it out in general orders, that he had
every rea&s;on to believe that powerful armies were acting in co-operation with
the army he had the honour to command.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">116.</NOTE>Q. Do you know at what time that
order was given out? </P> 
<P>A. The adjutant general's books will &s;hew it: I think it was
about the 3d of October.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">117.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip believe
that if the army under General Howe had co-operated up the North River with the
army under General Burgoyne, that the army under General Burgoyne would have
been obliged to have made the convention it did?</P> 
<P>A. That is a matter of judgment. The army looked forward to
that co-operation, which they were led to under&s;tand, by the orders General
Burgoyne had given out, with plea&s;ure.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">118.</NOTE>Q. What was the general opinion
of the officers of the army in which you &s;erved, on that &s;ubject of
co-operation?</P> 
<P>A. I do not think my rank in the army entitles me to give my
opinion on that &s;ub|ject; I &s;hall &s;till le&s;s pre&s;ume to give that of
others.</P> </Q><STAGE>[Withdrew.</STAGE></P>

that there was to be no co-operation from General Howe's army, and that Sir
William Howe had carried his army to Che&s;apeak Bay?</P> 
<P>A. I did not know that we were to expect no co-operation,
until after the con|vention was &s;igned.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">121.</NOTE>Q. When did you fir&s;t hear

&s;urpri&s;ed or di&s;appointed, or both, when you fir&s;t heard that Sir

<P>A. I neither knew the object of the campaign nor its

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">127.</NOTE>Q. Whether you did not think
General Howe's fighting General Wa&s;hington's grand army, at the battle of

<P>A. I was not at Brandywine.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">128.</NOTE>Q. Whether you was not
&s;urpri&s;ed when you returned home to this country, to learn that the
&s;ecretary of &s;tate for the American department, had information from
General Howe, of his intentions of going to the &s;outhward, before General
Burgoyne departed from this country, and never communicated that information to
General Burgoyne before his departure for Canada?</P> 
<P>A. I have the honour to &s;tand before this Hou&s;e as a
military man, and not as a politician, and cannot an&s;wer any que&s;tion but
tho&s;e relative to my own profe&s;&s;ion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">129.</NOTE>Q. What was your Lord&s;hip's

<P>A. The opinion I gave in the council of war, relative to the

undertake any enterpri&s;e that General Burgoyne would plea&s;e to employ them
upon.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">130.</NOTE>Q. When advice was received
that Sir Henry Clinton was coming up the North River, did you apprehend the
treaty of convention had gone &s;o far that it could not be broken?</P> 
<P>A. My opinion was, with re&s;pect to that que&s;tion, that
all military negotiations were fair and ju&s;tifiable, to make delays and to
gain time; I therefore thought and declared my &s;entiments, that General
Burgoyne was at full liberty to break off that treaty in the &s;tage it then
was; and I could not conceive that the public faith was engaged, until the

<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE>Q. After Lieutenant Colonel

<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE>Q. As &s;uch, did you make it your
bu&s;ine&s;s from the beginning of the campaign to get a knowledge of the
country?</P> 
<P>A. Whenever there was any occa&s;ion to obtain the knowledge
of any particular part of the country, a party was always &s;ent with me for
that purpo&s;e, but the woods were &s;o thick that it was impo&s;&s;ible to go
without a party.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE>Q. Was you well acquainted with
the country between Skene&s;borough and Fort Edward?</P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE>Q. How long was the army employed
in making the roads practicable between Skene&s;borough and Fort Edward?</P> 
<P>A. About &s;ix or &s;even days in making the road between
Skene&s;borough and Fort Anne, and between Fort Anne and Fort Edward. I do not
believe the army was delayed an hour on that account; there was a very good
road made by the rebels the year before, between Fort Anne and Fort Edward, in
which road the rebels had cut down &s;ome few trees which took the provincials
in our army &s;ome few hours to clear.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE>Q. Does not the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the country in the neighbourhood of Fort Ed|ward, nece&s;&s;arily prevent
the retreat of a garri&s;on that might be in Fort George?</P> 
<P><PB N="40" REF="47">A. It prevents the getting off any
artillery or &s;tores; but a garri&s;on might get through the woods, in ca&s;e
we were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground in the neighbourhood of Fort
Edward.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE>Q. Did not the garri&s;on of Fort

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE>Q. Had the army taken their route

would have taken to carry the troops &s;olely over Lake George, exclu&s;ive of

<P>A. I think between three and four hundred, which bateaux

<P>A. I &s;uppo&s;e a fortnight&mdash;Four hundred bateaux.</P>

pa&s;&s;ed over Lake George, how long did it take before the fir&s;t
tran&s;port of provi&s;ions arrived at Fort George?</P> 
<P>A. I can't recollect preci&s;ely.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE>Q. Con&s;idering the length of

by the route they took, than they could have been by the route of Ticonderoga
and Lake George?</P> 
<P>A. I have already &s;aid, that it would take a fortnight to
tran&s;port the 400 ba|teaux from Lake Champlain to Lake George; it therefore
would have delayed the army a fortnight longer than they were delayed to have

<P>A. I do remember once to have heard General Burgoyne expre&s;s
his concern at our not being able to bring forward a greater quantity of

have heard him &s;ay with very great earne&s;tne&s;s to General Phillips and

un&s;erviceable, from fatigue and hard labour.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE>Q. Was the tran&s;port of
provi&s;ions at any time impeded by the bringing forward the artillery from
Fort George?</P> 
<P>A. The artillery had a &s;eparate contract for hor&s;es, with
which they brought for|ward their own &s;tores. I don't recollect that any part
of the provi&s;ion train were ever employed in bringing forward artillery or
artillery &s;tores.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25.</NOTE>Q. Was it po&s;&s;ible, with the
means we had, to collect a month's &s;tore of provi&s;ions &s;ooner than it was
collected?</P> 
<P>A. I believe not, without the utter ruin of the hor&s;es
furni&s;hed by contract for the purpo&s;e of tran&s;porting &s;tores.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE>Q. Was you pre&s;ent in the
action of the 19th of September?</P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE>Q. Did the enemy di&s;pute the
field that day with ob&s;tinacy?</P> 
<P>A. They did, and the fire was much heavier than ever I &s;aw
it any where, unle&s;s at the affair of Fort Anne.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">28.</NOTE>Q. Do you know how long the
regiments of the Briti&s;h line were under that fire?</P> 
<P>A. The three Briti&s;h regiments (the 20th, 21&s;t, and 62d)
were engaged from three o'clock in the afternoon till &s;even in the evening;
and whil&s;t I was a pri&s;oner I heard the rebel quarter-ma&s;ter general
&s;ay, they had nine different regiments in the field, op|po&s;ed to the three
Briti&s;h I have named.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE>Q. Do you know the lo&s;s the
three Briti&s;h regiments &s;u&s;tained?</P> 
<P>A. I can't &s;ay.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the &s;trength
of the 62d regiment when they came out of the action?</P> 
<P>A. I can't &s;peak to the particular &s;trength of the
regiment when they came out of action; but I heard that they were not 100 rank
and file.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">31.</NOTE>Q. How many officers were left in
that regiment at the end of the action?</P> 
<P>A. I can't an&s;wer that que&s;tion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE>Q. From the general &s;tate of
the three Briti&s;h regiments, do you think that they would have been in a
proper condition to have attacked the enemy the next morning?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly not; nor to go on any &s;ervice whatever.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">33.</NOTE>Q. About what time of the day did
the enemy finally give way?</P> 
<P>A. They gave way very often; finally about &s;even in the
evening.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE>Q. Was it practicable, at that
time of the evening, and in that kind of country, to have pur&s;ued?</P> 
<P>A. I &s;hould think not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE>Q. Was you not often employed,
between the day of that action and the action of the 7th of October, to
reconnoitre?</P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">36.</NOTE>Q. Was you able to obtain a view
of the enemy's po&s;ition?</P> 
<P>A. I obtained a view of the po&s;ition of the right of the
rebel entrenchments.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">37.</NOTE>Q. What was the nature of their
po&s;ition to the right, with regard to entrench|ments?</P> 
<P><PB N="43" REF="50">A. They were po&s;ted on a hill that came
very near the river. On the top of the hill was a &s;trong brea&s;t-work, at
the foot an abbatis.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">38.</NOTE>Q. Did it appear to you that that
wing of the enemy was attackable? </P> 
<P>A. It is a que&s;tion that is &s;carcely in my line of
&s;ervice to an&s;wer; but as there are no general officers, nor older officers
than my&s;elf, who &s;erved under General Bur|goyne, I hope no military man
will think me pre&s;uming to give my opinion on that &s;ubject. I do think that
we could not have attacked the right wing of the rebel entrenchments without
ri&s;king the lo&s;s of the whole army, and with little probability of
&s;ucce&s;s.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">39.</NOTE>Q. Could you obtain a view of the
left wing of the enemy? </P> 
<P>A. I never &s;aw the left wing of the enemy's entrenchments
till I was taken pri&s;oner and conducted through their works.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">40.</NOTE>Q. On the 7th of October was you
in a &s;ituation to &s;ee the enemy advancing to the attack of your left?</P> 
<P>A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">41.</NOTE>Q. Did they advance under a well
&s;erved fire of grape-&s;hot from our artillery? </P> 
<P>A. I was in a &s;ituation that gave me an opportunity of
&s;eeing the directions of the rebels' columns; and I was very much
a&s;toni&s;hed to hear the &s;hot from the enemy fly &s;o thick, after our
cannonade had la&s;ted a quarter of an hour.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">42.</NOTE>Q. When the Briti&s;h grenadiers
were forced la&s;t from their po&s;t, what en&s;ued? </P> 
<P>A. I did not &s;ee the Briti&s;h grenadiers forced back. I
&s;aw them on their march, as I apprehended, taking a different po&s;ition; at
that time &s;everal of them broke their ranks, but on &s;ome aid du camps
calling to them for &s;hame, to continue their rank, they marched away to their
&s;tation in good order. A battalion of Brun&s;wickers that were on the left of
the artillery quitted their ground as &s;oon as the firing began, and, to the
be&s;t of my recollection, I did not &s;ee they left a man behind them on the
ground. I would add, that after &s;ome difficulty that battalion was brought to
make a &s;tand in the rear of the artillery, but in no order.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">43.</NOTE>Q. Was not that battalion brought
to that &s;tand by the activity and exhortation of Major General
Reide&s;el?</P> 
<P>A. I did not &s;ee General Reide&s;el endeavour to &s;top the
battalion; but I &s;aw an aid du camp of his and a brigade major, with their
drawn &s;words, keeping them up. I did &s;ee General Reide&s;el immediately
afterwards, on the right of the artillery, with the battalion perfectly formed,
and in good order.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">44.</NOTE>Q. Do you imagine that the giving
way of the battalion you fir&s;t de&s;cribed was the cau&s;e that the artillery
on that &s;pot was taken, and your&s;elf and Major Williams being made
pri&s;oners?</P> 
<P>A. I believe it contributed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, towards the
lo&s;s of the action on that day; but before Sir Francis Clarke died of his
wounds, he told me that he received his wound in bringing orders for the
artillery and the whole of the detach|ment to return to camp; and to the
circum&s;tance of Sir Francis Clarke's being wounded, I do attribute the lo&s;s
of the artillery, if not the lo&s;s of the whole army?</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">45.</NOTE>Q. Had you an opportunity, after
you was pri&s;oner, to &s;ee the left of the enemy's entrenchments?</P> 
<P>A. I had.</P> 
<P><PB N="44" REF="51"><NOTE PLACE="marg">46.</NOTE>Q. Was the
ground within cannon &s;hot of the left open and commanding it?</P> 
<P>A. All the ground I &s;aw was cleared and entrenched.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">47.</NOTE>Q. Was there not ground within
cannon &s;hot that would have commanded that entrenchment on the left?</P> 
<P>A. There was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">48.</NOTE>Q. Had we gained
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that ground, and been able to erect batteries of our
heavie&s;t guns, would not the whole line of the enemy have been enfiladed?</P>

<P>A. The ground alluded to was entrenched, and commanded the
whole of the rebel camp and lines. If the army had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
that ground, I do not believe the rebels would have &s;taid one hour in their
camp.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">49.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever hear, in
conver&s;ation with the rebel officers, that General Ar|nold, fore&s;eeing that
inconvenience, had marched out of his lines, and attacked, without orders from
General Gates?</P> 
<P>A. I did hear that General Arnold had marched out on the 7th
of October, without orders from General Gates. I did al&s;o hear that he
advi&s;ed the going out to meet Gene|ral Burgoyne on his march, and engaging
him before he approached their lines; and the rea&s;on he gave was this: If
General Burgoyne &s;hould ever come near enough their lines to be able to make
u&s;e of his artillery, that he would certainly po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of
their camp; that their troops in that ca&s;e would never &s;tand any where; but
if, on the other hand, the rebels &s;hould be defeated in the woods, the troops
would, after that, have confidence in their works, for which rea&s;on Arnold
advi&s;ed ri&s;king an action in the woods before General Burgoyne came near
enough to fee their works.</P></Q></P>
<P> <HI>Examined by other Members of the Committee, and by
General Burgoyne occa&s;ionally.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">50.</NOTE>Q. Did not your &s;ituation, as
deputy quarter ma&s;ter general, lead you to mix very much with the different
officers of the army?</P> 
<P>A. It did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">51.</NOTE>Q. What do you apprehend to have
been the general opinion of the officers of General Burgoyne's conduct, as well
in action as in the many trying occa&s;ions which have been &s;tated by you at
the bar?</P> 
<P>A. They entertained a very high opinion of General Burgoyne's
conduct.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">52.</NOTE>Q. Had General Burgoyne the full
confidence of the army under his command to the la&s;t moment?</P> 
<P>A. He certainly had.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">53.</NOTE>Q. What was the army's opinion of
the rebels after their retreat from Ticonde|roga?</P> 
<P>A. The army in general did not think, after they had evacuated
Ticonderoga, that they would make a &s;tand any where.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">54.</NOTE>Q. What was the rea&s;on given in

the 16th of Augu&s;t to the 13th of September, before they cro&s;&s;ed the
Hud&s;on's River to engage the rebels as Stillwater?</P> 
<P>Q. To bring forward a &s;ufficient quantity of provi&s;ions
and artillery, to enable the general to give up his communication.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">56.</NOTE>Q. What was the opinion of the

<P>A. They did think it was their indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to
proceed forward and fight the rebels, which we heard were then at
Stillwater.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">57.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever forage to the
right of General Fra&s;er's camp before the 7th of Augu&s;t?</P> 
<P>A. We never foraged to the right of the camp at Freeman's
Farm, at any one time; on the 7th of October, while the troops were in the
field, General Fra&s;er ordered all the batmen and drivers, belonging to his
brigade, to come and forage in the rear of the troops.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">58.</NOTE>Q. Do you know what was General
Fra&s;er's opinion on your foraging to the right?</P> 
<P>A. I do know that General Fra&s;er mentioned to me, on the 5th
of October, that there was forage on the right of his camp; but at that time
the ground on which that forage was to be met with was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the rebels' advanced po&s;t.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">59.</NOTE>Q. Do you think your army would
have been lo&s;t, if even the expedition from New York had taken place a few
days &s;ooner?</P> 
<P>A. If the troops had arrived at New York &s;oon enough to have
enabled Sir Henry Clinton to have made his expedition up the North River a week
&s;ooner, I do conceive that our army would not have been lo&s;t.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">60.</NOTE>Q. What was the opinion of the
rebels on Sir William Howe's going to the &s;outhward.</P> 
<P>A. I was not acquainted enough with the rebel leaders, to hear
their opinion on that que&s;tion. I do not think that the pea&s;ants of the
country were judges of the propriety of Sir William Howe's conduct.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">61.</NOTE>Q. What was the opinion of the
officers of General Burgoyne's army, after it was lo&s;t, relative to the
cro&s;&s;ing Hud&s;on's River.</P> 
<P>A. They did think that the alternative of retreating with
their army to Ca|nada, or proceeding to Stillwater, under the nece&s;&s;ity of
giving up his commu|nication, to be an unfortunate &s;ituation; but I never
heard any officers &s;ay that they thought General Burgoyne had done wrong;
many &s;aid, that if they had re|treated without ri&s;king an action, at the
time Sir Henry Clinton was coming up the North River, the army would never have
forgiven him, nor would he ever have forgiven him&s;elf.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">62.</NOTE>Q. Was you at New York after the

<P><PB N="46" REF="53">A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">63.</NOTE>Q. What was the opinion or the
language of the military at that place, relative to Sir William Howe's

<P>A. Whatever opinion was formed of Sir William Howe's
expedition to Pen&s;yl|vania, or is formed previous to this enquiry, &s;uch an
opinion mu&s;t have been ill|founded, as Sir William Howe's rea&s;ons were not

River&mdash;Why did they think that that mea&s;ure was particularly their
in|di&s;pen&s;ible duty?</P> 
<P>A. If the Hud&s;on's River had not been there, the army would
have thought it their indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to have gone and ri&s;ked an
action before they returned to Canada. If I recollect right, I &s;aid, that if
the army had returned to Canada, without fighting, that the army would never
have forgiven the general, nor the general have forgiven him&s;elf.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">66.</NOTE>Q. Do you know the nature of the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">67.</NOTE>Q. Could the army have taken that
route, in order to pa&s;s the river oppo&s;ite or near to Albany?</P> 
<P>A. The army could not have taken that route, as part of the

very rugged, and not pa&s;&s;able nearer than two miles from the river.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">68.</NOTE>Q. Was it not a nece&s;&s;ary

taken that route?</P> 
<P>A. I think I have &s;aid the army could not take that route;
if the army had marched on the ea&s;t of the Hud&s;on's River, they could not
have marched near enough to have covered their provi&s;ion bateaux from the

between Fort Edward and Albany, that the army could not carry provi&s;ions with
them to &s;upport them during the march?</P>

Fort Edward, but that a corps of troops might certainly carry provi&s;ions
&s;ufficient for the march to Albany.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">73.</NOTE>Q. Was it not under&s;tood, that
if you had arrived at Albany, that the army would find plenty of provi&s;ions
there?</P> 
<P>A. It was generally believed, and I believe it my&s;elf
firmly, that if the army had got to Albany, we &s;hould have found a number of

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE>Q. Did General Burgoyne repair
immediately to the Indian camp, and call them to council, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
Brigadier General Fra&s;er?</P> 
<P>A. He did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE>Q. What pa&s;&s;ed at that
council? </P> 
<P>A. General Burgoyne threatened the culprit with death,
in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould be delivered up; and there were many gentlemen of
the army, and I own I was one of the number, who feared that he would put that
threat in execution. Mo|tives of policy, I believe alone, prevented him from
it; and if he had not pardoned the man, which he did, I believe the total
defection of the Indians would have en|&s;ued, and the con&s;equences, on their
return through Canada, might have been dreadful; not to &s;peak of the weight
they would have thrown into the op|po&s;ite &s;cale, had they gone over to the
enemy, which I rather imagine would have been the ca&s;e.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember General
Burgoyne's re&s;training the Indian parties from going out without a Briti&s;h
officer or proper conductor, who were to be re&s;pon|&s;ible for their
behaviour?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember Mr. St. Luc's
reporting di&s;contents among&s;t the Indians, &s;oon after our arrival at Fort
Edward?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE>Q. How long was that after
enforcing the re&s;traints above mentioned? </P> 
<P>A. I can't exactly &s;ay; I &s;hould imagine about three weeks
or a month.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip recollect
General Burgoyne's telling Mr. St. Luc, that he had rather lo&s;e every Indian,
than connive at their enormities, or u&s;ing lan|guage to that effect?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip remember
what pa&s;&s;ed in council with the Indians at Fort Edward?</P> 
<P><PB N="50" REF="57">A. To the be&s;t of my recollection, much
the &s;ame exhortation to act with huma|nity, and much the &s;ame rewards were
offered for &s;aving their pri&s;oners.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the
circum&s;tance of the Indians de&s;iring to return home at that time?</P> 
<P>A. I do, perfectly well.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember that many
quitted the army without leave?</P> 
<P>A. I do, immediately after the council, and the next
morning.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE>Q. Was it not the general opinion
that the defection of the Indians, then and afterwards, was cau&s;ed by the
re&s;traint upon their cruelties and habits of plun|der?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE>Q. Had you rea&s;on to believe
that the expedition to Bennington was much de&s;ired by General Reide&s;el, and
that it was his wi&s;h to have it conducted by Lieu|tenant Colonel Baume?</P> 
<P>A. It was always imagined in the army, that it was his wi&s;h,
and that Colonel Baume was appointed to the command of it in compliment to
him.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25.</NOTE>Q. Did you know the corps of
Briti&s;h, commanded by Captain Fra&s;er, which made part of that
expedition?</P> 
<P>A. They were volunteers from the Briti&s;h regiments, and
al&s;o &s;tood very high in the opinion of the army, from their gallant
behaviour on all occa&s;ions.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember General
Burgoyne's vi&s;iting the detachment after it was a&s;&s;embled, and conferring
with Colonel Baume?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE>Q. Did Colonel Baume appear
&s;atisfied with the &s;trength of his corps?</P> 
<P>A. I conver&s;ed with Colonel Baume, and with &s;everal
officers under his command, and they appeared perfectly &s;atisfied, at lea&s;t
I heard no complaint from them; the only anxiety they expre&s;&s;ed was, le&s;t
the de&s;tination of that corps &s;hould become known to the enemy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">28.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip remember
General Burgoyne's receiving, in the night, a letter from Lieutenant Colonel
Baume, expre&s;&s;ing he found the enemy in greater force than he expected?</P>

<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember Sir Francis
Clarke, General Burgoyne's aid du camp, being &s;ent with orders to Colonel
Breyman to march immediately to &s;upport him?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30.</NOTE>Q. Did you communicate the &s;ame
order to General Reide&s;el at the &s;ame time?</P> 
<P>A. I did.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">31.</NOTE>Q. Was Colonel Breyman the
neare&s;t corps for the purpo&s;e of that &s;upport?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE>Q. Did Brigadier General Fra&s;er
at all times treat your Lord&s;hip with great confidence?</P> 
<P><PB N="51" REF="58">A. I was often with General Fra&s;er, and
he frequently talked without re&s;erve upon matters which he was not
particularly bound to conceal. There were certain matters of intelligence which
it would have been improper for him to mention to any body. In this ca&s;e I
cannot boa&s;t &s;o much of his confidence, as to &s;uppo&s;e that he would
have opened his mind to me on matters which he would have concealed from the
re&s;t of his friends.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">33.</NOTE>Q. Have you not frequently been
pre&s;ent when General Burgoyne and General Fra&s;er di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the object
of the campaign, and conver&s;ed freely on the circum&s;tances of the time?</P>

<P>A. I have.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE>Q. Did your Lord&s;hip ever, in
pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence of General Burgoyne, hear Ge|neral Fra&s;er expre&s;s a
di&s;approbation of pa&s;&s;ing the Hud&s;on's River?</P> 
<P>A. I never did?</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE>Q. Do you know or believe that
the idea of forcing our way to Albany was pre|valent throughout the army?</P> 
<P>A. In every conver&s;ation I had with different officers of
the army, I never remem|ber once to have heard it doubted, but that we were to
force our way.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">36.</NOTE>Q. Did the army pa&s;s the
Hud&s;on's River with alacrity? </P> 
<P>A. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any army to have been in higher
&s;pirits than they were at that time, or more de&s;irous of coming to an
engagement with the enemy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">37.</NOTE>Q. Do you not conceive, that to
have remained po&s;ted behind the Hud&s;on's River, at the time the army
pa&s;&s;ed it and advanced, would have ca&s;t a damp on the &s;pirits of that
army and a reflection on their General?</P> 
<P>A. From the eagerne&s;s of the army to advance and the great
unea&s;ine&s;s that was di&s;cernible through it on every delay, I apprehended
that it could not have been otherwi&s;e; and I think that General Burgoyne's
character would not have &s;tood very high either with the army, this country,
or the enemy, had he halted at Fort Edward.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">38.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the march up
to the enemy on the 19th of Septem|ber? </P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">39.</NOTE>Q. Will you plea&s;e to
de&s;cribe it? </P> 
<P>A. The army marched in three divi&s;ions; the German line
flanking, the artillery and baggage pur&s;ued the cour&s;e of the river through
the meadows, and formed the left hand divi&s;ion; the Briti&s;h line marched
parallel to it at &s;ome di&s;tance through the woods, and formed the centre
divi&s;ion; General Fra&s;er's corps, with the grena|diers and light infantry
of the Germans, were obliged to make a large detour through the woods, and
formed the right hand divi&s;ion or column. Beyond this, on the right, there
were, as I under&s;tand, flanking parties of light infantry and
Provin|cials?</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">40.</NOTE>Q. Was the country, over which
the army pa&s;&s;ed, inter&s;ected with a deep ravine?</P> 
<P>A. It was one of the deepe&s;t I ever &s;aw.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">41.</NOTE>Q. Which column was fir&s;t
attacked? </P> 
<P>A. The advanced party, con&s;i&s;ting of the picquets of the
centre column, being &s;ent <PB N="52" REF="59"> forwards, under the command of
Major Forbes, to explore the way by which that column was to pa&s;s, fell in
with a con&s;iderable body of the rebels, po&s;ted in a hou&s;e and behind
fences, which they attacked, and after a great deal of fire, the detach|ment
nearly drove in the body of rebels; but on finding that the woods quite round
them were filled with the enemy, they were obliged to retire to the main
body.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">42.</NOTE>Q. Was the march &s;o performed
that when General Burgoyne formed the line of the Briti&s;h infantry, General
Fra&s;er's corps were ready upon their right to &s;upport them?</P> 
<P>A. General Fra&s;er, on hearing the fire of Major Forbes's
party, detached two com|panies to &s;upport them, which came up ju&s;t after
that engagement was over; and on their appearance the enemy finding that our
troops were in &s;trength, quitted the po&s;t they had before occupied, and,
immediately after this, the whole line was formed with the utmo&s;t regularity.
I would explain, that when I &s;peak of the line, I do not include the left
hand column which was compo&s;ed of Germans, and which did not come into the
line or into action till late in the day.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">43.</NOTE>Q. How long did the action
la&s;t?</P> 
<P>A. From three o'clock, I think, till very near eight.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">44.</NOTE>Q. How long were the 20th,
21&s;t, and 62d regiments engaged?</P> 
<P>A. During the greate&s;t part of that time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">45.</NOTE>Q. Was the action well di&s;puted
by the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. It was, very ob&s;tinately.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">46.</NOTE>Q. Was your Lord&s;hip near the
per&s;on of General Burgoyne during that action, except when you were employed
to carry orders?</P> 
<P>A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">47.</NOTE>Q. Were not different attempts
made by the General's orders to charge the enemy with bayonets, and did not
tho&s;e attempts fail by the heavine&s;s of the enemy's fire and thickne&s;s of
the woods?</P> 
<P>A. There were many attempts made for that purpo&s;e, and they
all failed except the la&s;t, when the Briti&s;h troops finally drove them out
of the field.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">48.</NOTE>Q. When part of the German troops
did get into action that day under General Reide&s;el, how did they behave?</P>

<P>A. I heard their behaviour &s;poke of in the highe&s;t terms;
they marched up to the enemy with great coolne&s;s and &s;teadine&s;s, and gave
them, as I was told, three vollies by word of command from their officers.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">49.</NOTE>Q. Can your Lord&s;hip &s;peak to
the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the three Briti&s;h regiments, the 62d in
particular?</P> 
<P>A. The lo&s;s was very con&s;iderable; but I don't recollect
the numbers.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">50.</NOTE>Q. Were tho&s;e three Briti&s;h
regiments in a condition to have attacked the enemy the next morning?</P> 
<P>A. Their numbers were &s;o reduced, that I apprehend they were
not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">51.</NOTE>Q. From the lo&s;s of killed and
wounded, particularly of officers, would it have been de&s;irable to have
brought tho&s;e three regiments into action for the next ten days?</P> 
<P>A. In le&s;s than ten days the &s;tate of tho&s;e regiments
certainly would not have <PB N="53" REF="60"> been much mended; I therefore
apprehend, that if they were not in a condition to be brought into action the
next morning, their inability would have &s;till continued for tho&s;e ten
days.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">52.</NOTE>Q. Had the army made a movement
to gain the left of the enemy's entrench|ments before the redoubts were
con&s;tructed that commanded the plain near the river, would not all the
bateaux, &s;tores, and ho&s;pitals have been expo&s;ed to attack?</P> 
<P>A. It certainly would have been &s;o.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">53.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the
&s;carcity of forage on the we&s;t-&s;ide of the river? </P> 
<P>A. I do perfectly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">54.</NOTE>Q. Would not the bridge of boats,
con&s;tructed for the purpo&s;e of foraging to the ea&s;t &s;ide, have al&s;o
been expo&s;ed before the redoubts, above mentioned, were rai&s;ed?</P> 
<P>A. They certainly would, had it not been for tho&s;e redoubts
and a work called the <HI>T&ecirc;te du pont,</HI> which was rai&s;ed for the
protection of the bridge.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">55.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect how long it
took to rai&s;e tho&s;e redoubts, to throw the bridge, and rai&s;e the
<HI>T&ecirc;te du pont?</HI></P> 
<P>A. If I recollect right, the bridge it&s;elf was fini&s;hed in
one night; the making and compleating the other works took &s;ome days.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">56.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip remember
General Burgoyne mentioning to you in confidence, the receipt of a letter from
Sir Henry Clinton, and his hourly ex|pectation of his attacking the Highlands,
and his opinion that his &s;ucce&s;s there mu&s;t di&s;lodge the enemy without
attacking their entrenchments?</P> 
<P>A. I perfectly recollect the General's mentioning all this to
me.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">57.</NOTE>Q. Was you near General Burgoyne
in the action of the 7th of October? </P> 
<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">58.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect what orders
you carried? </P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">59.</NOTE>Q. What were they? </P> 
<P>A. The fir&s;t orders I recollect to have carried, were to
po&s;t fifty men under the command of a captain of the 20th regiment, to the
left of the detachment of the army, in order, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to join them
to the advanced works of General Fra&s;er's camp, and, in ca&s;e of any
accident, to protect the detachment, &s;hould they find it nece&s;&s;ary, to
retire thither.</P> 
<P>The next orders I carried were to Major General Phillips, at
the end of the action, acquainting him, that as that detachment &s;eemed much
di&s;ordered from the enemy having turned both their flanks, that it was
nece&s;&s;ary to draw it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible back to the camp, which
&s;eemed menaced with an attack; the care of this General Burgoyne committed to
General Phillips, while he him&s;elf returned to the camp, in order to take
proper mea&s;ures for its defence. On our return thither the works of the camp
were actually attacked as General Burgoyne had fore&s;een, and I was then
em|ployed to collect what troops I &s;hould meet, and to order them to tho&s;e
parts where they were mo&s;t wanted. Soon after this, the enemy having got
round the right of our camp, we expected an attack upon our rear, and I then
was di&s;patched with orders from General Burgoyne to Brigadier General
Hamilton, for all the works in <PB N="54" REF="61"> the rear of the camp, which
had been previou&s;ly con&s;tructed, to be manned with &s;uch &s;oldiers as he
could &s;pare from the defence of the front.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">60.</NOTE> Q Does your Lord&s;hip know what
orders Sir Francis Clarke was charged with, at the time he received his
wound?</P> 
<P>A. I met Sir Francis Clarke as I was &s;earching for General
Phillips, and ac|quainted him with my orders, telling him at the &s;ame time,
that as the thick|ne&s;s of the wood might prevent my finding General Phillips
directly, I wi&s;hed he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me, in order that no time might be
lo&s;t in delivering tho&s;e orders; that was the la&s;t time I &s;aw Sir
Francis Clarke, and I believe that &s;oon afterwards he re|ceived the wound of
which he died?</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">61.</NOTE>Q. Was it dark before General
Burgoyne had a certainty that Col. Breyman was killed, and his po&s;t carried
by the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. It was &s;o dark that the officer, who I believe fir&s;t
brought the intelligence of it, &s;eeing a number of men round the fires of
that camp, took them for Germans, and was not convinced of his error till he
was fired upon by them, as they proved to be a party of the enemy who had
forced the works.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">62.</NOTE>Q. Did General Burgoyne u&s;e any
efforts to rally the Germans who were returning from the action, and to
per&s;uade them to recover Colonel Breyman's po&s;t?</P> 
<P>A. He certainly did his utmo&s;t endeavours for that
purpo&s;e, which however were ineffectual from the darkne&s;s of the night, and
the entire confu&s;ion in which they were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">63.</NOTE>Q. Were any other troops at hand
that could have been &s;pared for that pur|po&s;e?</P> 
<P>A. There certainly were not; every regiment was occupied in
defence of its own lines which were not certainly overmanned.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">64.</NOTE>Q. In the heat of the action do
you recollect &s;eeing General Reide&s;el about the time that the Germans, on
the left of the Briti&s;h artillery, were giving way?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">65.</NOTE>Q. Was not General Reide&s;el
exerting him&s;elf to re&s;tore order in his troops?</P> 
<P>A. General Reide&s;el appeared to me to have behaved, on that
occa&s;ion, in every way as became a brave and intelligent officer.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">66.</NOTE>Q. Was the retreat of the army in
the night of the 7th made in good order, and a new po&s;ition taken by the time
it was day-light?</P> 
<P>A. It certainly was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">67.</NOTE>Q. Was the army under arms the
whole day of the 8th, and in continual expecta|tion of action?</P> 
<P>A. They were, and indeed were cannonaded during the greate&s;t
part of that day, and the advanced corps in particular, who were po&s;ted on a
hill, were under almo&s;t a continual fire from the riflemen of the enemy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">68.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the
circum&s;tance of General Fra&s;er's funeral on the afternoon of that day?</P> 
<P>A. I do, perfectly well; the redoubt in which he was buried
was very heavily cannonaded during the ceremony, and even previous to this they
fired at tho&s;e who <PB N="55" REF="62"> attended the corp&s;e on its way
thither, which I &s;uppo&s;e was accidental, and pro|ceeded from the enemy's
&s;eeing a number of people together.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">69.</NOTE>Q. Who were the chief per&s;ons
who attended that funeral? </P> 
<P>A. All the generals of the army, their aid du camps, and I
believe all tho&s;e who were not attached to any particular po&s;t, which at
that time were very few.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">70.</NOTE>Q. Was the retreat of the army on
the night of the 8th, and on the day and part of the night of the 9th, made in
good order?</P> 
<P>A. It was made in perfect good order.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">71.</NOTE>Q. What was the weather on the
day of the 9th? </P> 
<P>A. Exceeding wet. </P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">72.</NOTE>Q. What was the &s;tate of the
troops, in point of fatigue, when they arrived at Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. They certainly mu&s;t have been much fatigued, from the
length of time they had been under arms, and more particularly &s;o from the
badne&s;s of the roads, occa|&s;ioned by the rains.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">73.</NOTE>Q. When it was day-light the next
morning, did you &s;ee any part of the enemy upon the plain at Saratoga, on the
ground where our artillery was afterwards po&s;ted?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">74.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip recollect
&s;eeing a corps of the enemy on the other &s;ide the Hud&s;on's River
oppo&s;ite to Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. Perfectly well; and they &s;eemed in force.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">75.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the
circum&s;tance of a battery opening from that corps? </P> 
<P>A. I do perfectly well. The general, General Phillips, and
&s;everal other gentle|men were at dinner. We were all obliged to remove, from
finding our&s;elves in the range of that battery.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">76.</NOTE>Q. We being in the range of that
battery, mu&s;t it not nece&s;&s;arily have com|manded the ford on the
Hud&s;on's River?</P> 
<P>A. It certainly did command that ford.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">77.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect Lieut. Col.
Sutherland being &s;ent with a detachment of regulars and provincials from
Saratoga, to cover a party of workmen employed to repair bridges, and render
the road practicable?</P> 
<P>A. I perfectly recollect it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">78.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect for what
rea&s;on Colonel Sutherland and the regulars were re|called? </P> 
<P>A. I under&s;tood it was on the apprehen&s;ion of an

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">79.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip recollect
different &s;couts bringing reports of the enemy's being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the country between Saratoga and Fort Edward, on both &s;ides of the
river?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">80.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember General
Burgoyne's mentioning, in confidence to you, dif|ferent ideas of forcing the
ford over Hud&s;on's River; of cutting away by the ene|my's right, and
attempting a rapid march to Albany; or by a night march to gain the fords above
Fort Edward?</P> 
<P>A. I do perfectly remember that he mentioned to me all tho&s;e
ideas.</P> 
<P><PB N="56" REF="63"><NOTE PLACE="marg">81.</NOTE>Q. Did you
ever hear of an offer made by General Phillips to make his way to Ticonderoga
with a body of troops?</P> 
<P>A. No.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">82.</NOTE>Q. In the intimacy in which you
lived with Major General Phillips, my&s;elf, and the officers in General
Phillips's family, do you not think you &s;hould have heard of &s;uch an offer
had it been made?</P> 
<P>A. I apprehend that I &s;hould have heard of it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">83.</NOTE>Q. Did your Lord&s;hip hear of
General Phillips offering to attempt an e&s;cape through the woods, with one or
two guides, for the purpo&s;e of putting him&s;elf at the head of the troops at
Ticonderoga, for the future defence of that place?</P> 
<P>A. I heard it mentioned &s;ince I came to England, in &s;ome
common conver&s;a|tion; but I never heard it hinted at while I was in
America.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">84.</NOTE>Q. The day before the council of
the generals and field officers was called, can your Lord&s;hip &s;peak of the
&s;tate of things in general at Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. The &s;tate of our army was certainly as bad as
po&s;&s;ible. Their numbers were few, their provi&s;ions &s;hort, and their
po&s;ition not a good one, owing to the nature of the country, which ro&s;e to
the di&s;tance of &s;ome miles, one hill overtopping that which was next to
it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">85.</NOTE>Q. Do you know any officer of
that army who, in that &s;ituation, thought we had a right to more than
honourable terms?</P> 
<P>A. Our &s;ituation, in the apprehen&s;ion of every one there
with whom I conver&s;ed, did not entitle us to more.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">86.</NOTE>Q. Did the army in general look
on the terms obtained, namely, the power of &s;erving their country in other
places, to be advantageous as well as honourable, and more than they had a
right to expect?</P> 
<P>A. I believe they certainly did; and that few per&s;ons in the
army expected &s;o good terms as tho&s;e which were granted.</P></Q></P>
<P> <HI>Examined by other Members of the Committee, and by
General Burgoyne occa&s;ionally.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">87.</NOTE>Q. Did the Indians leave the army
till after the battle of Bennington?</P> 
<P>A. Great numbers did, and at many different times.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">88.</NOTE>Q. Were not &s;ome Indians on the
expedition to Bennington?</P> 
<P>A. There were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">89.</NOTE>Q. Was the expedition originally
&s;ent out to Bennington?</P> 
<P>A. My &s;ituation in the army not entitling me to be in the
council of war, and not being employed on that expedition, I was of cour&s;e
not entru&s;ted with the orders that were given to Col. Baume.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">90.</NOTE>Q. Have you rea&s;on to
&s;uppo&s;e that General Reide&s;el or Colonel Baume had a par|ticular
knowledge of that part of the country, &s;o as to make it particularly proper
to give Colonel Baume the command of that expedition?</P> 
<P>A. I believe there was no officer in that army of &s;ufficient
rank to have com|manded &s;uch an expedition, who ever had been in that
particular part of the country.</P> 
<P><PB N="57" REF="64"><NOTE PLACE="marg">91.</NOTE>Q. The
intention of the expedition being, as appears by the papers on the table, to
&s;ound the di&s;po&s;ition of the people of that country, was that part of the
coun|try peopled with Germans, as many other parts of the country are?</P> 
<P>A. I can't exactly &s;peak to the de&s;cription of the people
of that country, as I was never there my&s;elf; but there were employed on that
expedition numbers of provincials, many of whom were of that very country; and
I apprehend that the common &s;oldiers of a regular army are not the immediate
people who are expected to &s;ound the minds of any country to which they are
&s;ent.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">92.</NOTE>Q. As your Lord&s;hip mentioned
the alacrity with which the army pa&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on's River, did the army
in general think them&s;elves at that time inadequate to the purpo&s;e of
forcing their way to Albany?</P> 
<P>A. The opinions of an army, who cannot be acquainted with the
intelligence that has been received, are often erroneous. The army was in high
&s;pirits, and did not, I believe, doubt of reaching Albany.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">93.</NOTE>Q. Did the General then doubt of
reaching Albany? </P> 
<P>A. I really don't know.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">94.</NOTE>Q. Were the rebels' entrenchments
completed on the 19th of September? </P> 
<P>A. I never &s;aw the entrenchments at all.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">95.</NOTE>Q. How was our army employed
between the 19th of September and the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. The army it&s;elf was employed in &s;trengthening its
po&s;ition.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">96.</NOTE>Q. Did it take the army eighteen
days to &s;trengthen its po&s;ition before it made any movement?</P> 
<P>A. I can't exactly &s;ay. They were working all the time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">97.</NOTE>Q. What works were executed in
that time? </P> 
<P>A. There were numbers of redoubts erected; the
t&ecirc;te-du-pont; lines before the camp; outworks to the lines, in which
guards and picquets were placed; and bat|teries.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">98.</NOTE>Q. How many redoubts were
erected? </P> 
<P>A. I think in all there mu&s;t have been five or &s;ix.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">99.</NOTE>Q. Was the erecting tho&s;e works
full employment for eighteen days? </P> 
<P>A. I am not an engineer, or I certainly &s;hould endeavour to
an&s;wer that que&s;tion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">100.</NOTE>Q. Were all tho&s;e works
nece&s;&s;ary, in your opinion, for an army that meant to march forward and
attack the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. They were nece&s;&s;ary in our particular &s;ituation,
being within half a mile of the enemy, to whom we were oppo&s;ed, and being
inferior in numbers.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">101.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip know
whether the enemy thought it nece&s;&s;ary to fortify them&s;elves with
redoubts?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know what the &s;pecies of their fortification was;
but I have been always told that great labour had been employed on their works;
and what &s;mall part I &s;aw of them convinced me of it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">102.</NOTE>Q. Had you not information from
de&s;erters or friends what the enemy was doing?</P> 
<P>A. My &s;ituation in that army did not entitle me to receive
that intelligence. When any per&s;on came to me to inform me that he had been
employed in gaining &s;uch in|telligence, my duty was to bring him to the
General.</P> 
<P><PB N="58" REF="65"><NOTE PLACE="marg">103.</NOTE>Q. Was it
not a matter of notoriety in the army, that the enemy received reinforce|ment
between the 19th of September and the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. The manner of receiving intelligence in an army &s;eldom
tran&s;pires; the army might gue&s;s, but I believe they knew nothing.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">104.</NOTE>Q. Was it not under&s;tood that
the rebels had &s;uffered a much greater lo&s;s than the king's troops on the
19th of September?</P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">105.</NOTE>Q. Was not the whole, or nearly
the whole, of the rebel army engag ed?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know; I apprehend the whole was not engaged.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">106.</NOTE>Q. Was our army in general, in
your apprehen&s;ion, in as good a condition on the 20th of September as the
rebel army, who had &s;uffered much more?</P> 
<P>A. The rebel army was &s;o numerous that their lo&s;s was not
equally felt with ours.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">107.</NOTE>Q. What number had you rea&s;on
to &s;uppo&s;e the rebel army con&s;i&s;ted of on the 19th of September?</P> 
<P>A. I always under&s;tood they were very numerous. I never
heard their numbers exactly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">108.</NOTE>Q. Was not the &s;carcity of
forage fore&s;een by every body?</P> 
<P>A. Tho&s;e with whom I conver&s;ed did not fore&s;ee it to the
extent in which we expe|rienced it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">109.</NOTE>Q. Was it prudent, in your
Lord&s;hip's opinion, to bring, or attempt to bring, up|wards of fourteen
hundred hor&s;es to attend the army, in a country &s;o de&s;titute of
forage?</P> 
<P>A. I never heard that the hor&s;es in our army were thought
too numerous. On all occa&s;ions a &s;carcity of them was complained of.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">110.</NOTE>Q. Do you know how many hor&s;es
were allowed for the baggage of each regiment?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">111.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip know how
many hor&s;es were employed about the train of artillery?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect; but the returns are on the table.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">112.</NOTE>Q. Was the heavy artillery
brought back from Stillwater, on the retreat of the army to Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. We had lo&s;t &s;ome &s;mall part of it, and the re&s;t was
brought to Saratoga.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">113.</NOTE>Q. Did the bringing back of that
artillery delay that retreat or not?</P> 
<P>A. An army with cannon certainly cannot march &s;o rapidly as
one without cannon; but cannon always creates a delay which armies have been
content to put up with.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">114.</NOTE>Q. Was it nece&s;&s;ary, in your
opinion, in the &s;ituation in which the army retreated, to make their retreat
as expeditious as po&s;&s;ible?</P> 
<P>A. The army appeared to me that it did make its retreat as
expeditious as po&s;|&s;ible.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">115.</NOTE>Q. Would the leaving of heavy
artillery behind, in your opinion, have made a difference of four miles in the
march?</P> 
<P>A. I can't conceive that it would. The enemy were in force
behind us; not having numbers to contend with them, it would have been a very
de&s;perate circum|&s;tance to have abandoned our cannon, in ca&s;e of an
attack.</P> 
<P><PB N="59" REF="66"><NOTE PLACE="marg">116.</NOTE>Q. Were the
heavy artillery, in effect, of any u&s;e in that retreat?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect as it happened, that they were of any
other u&s;e than that of their not being turned again&s;t us.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">117.</NOTE>Q. Might not tho&s;e cannon have
been &s;piked, and their trunnions have been knocked off, to have rendered them
u&s;ele&s;s?</P> 
<P>A. I under&s;tand that the &s;pikes in cannon are ea&s;ily
removed, and that it is not an ea&s;y matter, I believe almo&s;t an
impo&s;&s;ibility, with any tools that are carried in an army, to knock off the
trunnions of bra&s;s cannon.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">118.</NOTE>Q. Might not the retreat have
been accelerated by leaving behind a great part of the baggage?</P> 
<P>A. I don't think it would. I do not remember that we were
&s;topt on account of any particular impediment.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">119.</NOTE>Q. Does your Lord&s;hip know at
what time intelligence was received in General Burgoyne's army of the failure
of Colonel St. Leger's expedition?</P> 
<P>A. I think it mu&s;t have been in the month of Augu&s;t.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">120.</NOTE>Q. Was not that before the
pa&s;&s;ing of Hud&s;on's River? </P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect the exact date of receiving that
intelligence.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">121.</NOTE>Q. Was it in the month of
Augu&s;t? </P> 
<P>A. I cannot tell. I heard of it &s;ome time after by
accident.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">122.</NOTE>Q. Was there any heavy artillery
with the army, properly &s;o called? </P> 
<P>A There was none of the heavy &s;ort; we had medium
twelve-pounders, and two twenty-four pounders, which we took from the enemy at
Quebec, which were very much lighter than tho&s;e twelve-pounders.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">123. By Gen. Bur|goyne.</NOTE>Q. From the
&s;tate of the fatigue of the troops, when they arrived at Saratoga, do you
apprehend they could have continued their march though there had been no
artillery?</P> 
<P>A. The army was certainly very much fatigued. I believe they
could have got but very little further. They certainly were not in a &s;tate
for a long march.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">124. By General Burgoyne.</NOTE>Q. If the
battle expected at Saratoga had been on the plain, would not the heavie&s;t
artillery we had have been one of our be&s;t dependencies?</P> 
<P>A. It certainly would; it would have given us a manife&s;t
&s;uperiority in that particular.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">125. By General Burgoyne.</NOTE>Q. If the
army had not been provided with the number of hor&s;es they had, by what means
would their provi&s;ions or bateaux have been tran&s;ported in places where the
river was not navigable?</P> 
<P>A. The tran&s;portation of the bateaux and provi&s;ions could
not certainly have been carried on.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">126. By General Burgoyne.</NOTE>Q. Were
there not &s;uch places on the Hud&s;on's River between Fort Edward and
Albany?</P> 
<P>A. There were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">127. By other members.</NOTE>Q. Is it not
at any rate a principal object with every army, and of a retreating one in
particular, to pre&s;erve their artillery if it be po&s;&s;ible, even at the
expence of &s;ome labour and delay; and for the u&s;e they might be of to them
afterwards, as well as on the retreat?</P> 
<P><PB N="60" REF="67">A. I apprehend the cannon are &s;eldom
abandoned, but through ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">128.</NOTE>Q. Whether in general you can
inform the committee, whether the army had a confidence in the general?</P> 
<P>A. They certainly had a confidence in the general, and I do
not believe that they have altered their opinion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">129.</NOTE>Q. Did the army then in general,
and the officers in particular, entertain a favourable opinion of the general's
conduct, capacity, and attachment to them in the various &s;cenes in which he
was engaged, and more particularly on very trying occa&s;ions?</P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect that any officer, with whom I have had
conver&s;ation, has ever expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in different terms, and I
believe there never was an army more de&s;ervedly plea&s;ed with the conduct of
their general.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">130.</NOTE>Q. Whether the army
expre&s;&s;ed any di&s;&s;atisfaction at the general's return home; that is,
whether they thought he came with any purpo&s;es not friendly to them, or
looked on them&s;elves as de&s;erted by him?</P> 
<P>A. I was not with the army when General Burgoyne came away;
but I have conver&s;ed with many officers who have come from it, and they
expre&s;s no di&s;|&s;atisfaction on that head, much le&s;s looked on or
con&s;idered General Burgoyne's intentions as inimical to them.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">131.</NOTE>Q. What was the &s;tate of the
American artillery, and how was it &s;erved?</P> 
<P>A. Except on a few occa&s;ions, I do not remember their having
made much u&s;e of their cannon; I thought on tho&s;e occa&s;ions that they
&s;erved them &s;lowly, but not ill.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">132.</NOTE>Q. Whether all circum&s;tances
con&s;idered at the time of the affair of Saratoga, the retreat of the army was
practicable, either with or without artillery?</P> 
<P>A. I thought it was impracticable.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">133.</NOTE>Q. Whether after the convention
at Saratoga you went to Albany?</P> 
<P>A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">134.</NOTE>Q. Whether you had any
opportunity of ob&s;erving the nature of the country, if it was &s;trong or
woody, clear or open?</P> 
<P>A. Very &s;trong and woody, and a great number of hills.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">135.</NOTE>Q. What was the di&s;tance?</P> 
<P>A. I don't exactly recollect; about thirty-two miles.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">136.</NOTE>Q. Was the &s;ituation of Albany
a &s;trong &s;ituation, or was it commanded by hills round it?</P> 
<P>A. The &s;ituation of Albany was in a bottom very much
commanded.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">137.</NOTE>Q. If the army had penetrated to
Albany, from whence might they have drawn their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, if the
country had been again&s;t them?</P> 
<P>A. I don't know enough of the country to an&s;wer that
que&s;tion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">138.</NOTE>Q. Mu&s;t they not have drawn
their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from New York?</P> 
<P>A. I apprehend &s;o, if they were not ma&s;ters of the Mohawk
country.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">139.</NOTE>Q. Had you any opportunity of
ob&s;erving the extent of clear or cultivated coun|try round Albany?</P> 
<P>A. I can't very ju&s;tly de&s;cribe it, not having gone out of
the town of Albany, from the time I came into it, till I embarked for New
York.</P> 
<P><PB N="61" REF="68"><NOTE PLACE="marg">140.</NOTE>Q. Do you
think that, circum&s;tanced as the army was after the engagement of the 19th of
September, it would have been more advantageous to have returned than to have

<P>MAJOR FORBES called in and examined by General Burgoyne. 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE>Q. WAS you major of the 9th

<P>A. I was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE>Q. What was the behaviour of the
enemy on that occa&s;ion? </P> 
<P>A. At half pa&s;t ten in the morning, they attacked us in
front with a heavy and well-directed fire; a large body of them pa&s;&s;ed the
creek on the left, fired from a thick wood acro&s;s the creek on the left flank
of the regiment; they then began to re-cro&s;s the creek, and attack us in the
rear: we then found it nece&s;&s;ary to change our ground, to prevent the
regiments being &s;urrounded; we took po&s;t on the top of a high hill to our
right. As &s;oon as we had taken po&s;t, the enemy made a very vigorous attack,
which continued for upwards of two hours; and they cer|tainly would have forced
us, had it not been for &s;ome Indians that arrived and gave the Indian whoop,
which we an&s;wered with three cheers; the rebels &s;oon af|ter that gave
way.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE>Q. What command had you on the
19th of September? </P> 
<P>A. I commanded the picquets of the Briti&s;h.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE>Q. Was you attacked on the march,
and with what degree of vigour? </P> 
<P>A. I was attacked with great vigour from behind railed fences,
and a hou&s;e, by a body of riflemen and light infantry.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE>Q. Was you wounded in that affair?</P> 
<P>A. Very early in the day.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember General

fir&s;t opening of the wood?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE>Q. Did General Fra&s;er's corps
arrive preci&s;ely in time to occupy the heights on the right of the Briti&s;h
line when the action began?</P> 
<P>A. It did, and two companies of light infantry came to my

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE>Q. Where did General Burgoyne

<P><PB N="62" REF="69">A. As &s;oon as they came out of the wood,
they filed off to the right, and were drawn off at a &s;mall di&s;tance from
the left of General Fra&s;er's corps, with orders to occupy two hou&s;es, one
company in each, and defend them to the la&s;t extremity.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE>Q. Had you an opportunity in that

<P>A. I had while we remained in that po&s;ition.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE>Q. What was the progre&s;s of

<P>A. The twenty-fir&s;t and &s;ixty-&s;econd regiments were
drawn up on our left, and were attacked about three o'clock on the &s;ame
ground where the picquets had been attacked. About that time I heard a great
deal of firing to my right with the advanced corps; an officer came up to
General Burgoyne, and acquainted him that the enemy were endeavouring to turn
the left of the &s;ixty-&s;econd regi|ment, on which he di&s;patched an
aid-de-camp with orders to the twentieth regi|ment to form on the left of the
&s;ixty-&s;econd; immediately after, &s;ome compa|nies of the light infantry

ordered behind a deep ravine, to form a corps-de|re&s;erve. I &s;aw nothing of

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE>Q. What was the &s;trength of the

<P>A. On the 15th of the month the weekly return was given in,
and, to the be&s;t of my recollection, they were two hundred and fifty and odd
rank and file fit for duty.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE>Q. What was the &s;trength of the
other regiments in the Briti&s;h line?</P> 
<P>A. I cannot &s;peak with any certainty, as I did not &s;ee the

regiments were about one thou&s;and one hundred, and the advanced corps about
one thou&s;and two hun|dred.</P>

two with the advanced corps.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE>Q. Where were the other two

Briti&s;h troops in a condition to have attacked an enemy in in|trenchments
after the action?</P> 
<P>A. After the action of the 19th, I went to the ho&s;pital to
get my wounds dre&s;&s;ed, and did not join the regiment till the 8th of
October; I can't there|fore give an opinion of my own: but I have heard

<P>A. Not that I know of. I was at the ho&s;pital at the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25.</NOTE>Q. Did the battery of the enemy
on the other &s;ide of the river at Saratoga com|mand the fort on that

po&s;&s;ible for the army to have pa&s;&s;ed that ford without artillery to
cover them, and the enemy po&s;ted on the other &s;ide?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly not. I had an opportunity of &s;eeing the
twentieth regiment pa&s;s that ford without an enemy to oppo&s;e them, and they
took a con&s;iderable time, owing to the depth of the water, the rapidity of
the current, and the &s;tones being remarkable &s;lippery, &s;o that &s;everal

<P>A. I did not hear that they had.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">38.</NOTE>Q. Suppo&s;ing the rebels to have

<P>A. It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to judge&mdash;I did not know
their &s;trength on the 19th of September, or what reinforcements they received

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">41.</NOTE>Q. Did you apprehend the army
might have made their retreat good to Canada immediately after the action of

Sir Henry Clinton on the North River had taken place in time, it would not have
been looked on as a very advantageous co-operation with General Burgoyne's

previous to the arrival of his reinforcement from Europe?</P> 
<P>A. Not knowing Sir Henry Clinton's &s;trength, or his orders,

<P> CAPTAIN BLOOMFIELD, of the Artillery, called in, and examined
by General Burgoyne. 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE>Q. IN what capacity did you
&s;erve in the campaign in America in 1776 and 1777?</P> 
<P>A. I was major of brigade of the royal artillery.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE>Q. Was you employed by General
Phillips, on your return to England, after the campaign of 1776, to &s;olicit a
further &s;upply of artillery for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing campaign?</P> 
<P>A. On my leaving General Phillips at St. John's, in the month
of November, 1776, I was charged with a letter to Sir Guy Carleton, wherein he
recommended <PB N="67" REF="74"> it to make a demand of a further &s;upply of
artillery and &s;tores for the com|plete equipment of an additional number of
gun-boats for the &s;ervice of Lake Champlain in the en&s;uing campaign, and
likewi&s;e for the boats them&s;elves to be &s;ent out in frame-work. Sir Guy
Carleton, on peru&s;ing the letter, di&s;ap|proved of the boats being &s;ent
out, but approved of the demand of the &s;tores and artillery agreeable to
General Phillips's reque&s;t, and they were accordingly &s;ent out in the
beginning of the year 1777.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE>Q. At what time did you join the
army in the campaign of 1777? </P> 
<P>A. I joined the army at Ticonderoga on the 23d of July.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4.</NOTE>Q. Did you live in the family of
General Phillips, and had you occa&s;ion to know his &s;entiments re&s;pecting
the artillery department?</P> 
<P>A. I did chiefly live with the general, and had frequent
occa&s;ion to know his &s;entiments on the &s;ubject of the artillery in the
cour&s;e of my duty as brigade|major.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">5.</NOTE>Q. Did you know, or had you
rea&s;on to believe, that the proportion of ar|tillery employed that campaign
was according to the opinion and recommenda|tion of General Phillips?</P> 
<P>A. I can have no doubt but that an officer of General
Phillips's rank and exten&s;ive experience mu&s;t have determined that
point.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6.</NOTE>Q. What was the di&s;tribution of
the artillery after the enemy evacuated Ti|conderoga? </P> 
<P>A. The light brigade of artillery proceeded with the army by
the way of Skene&s;borough; the park brigade and &s;tores were conveyed
acro&s;s Lake George in bateaux.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7.</NOTE>Q. Was not a con&s;iderable
portion of artillery of the heavie&s;t kind either left at St. John's, &s;ent
back from Ticonderoga, or di&s;po&s;ed of in ve&s;&s;els?</P> 
<P>A. It was: there were left at Ticonderoga &s;ix heavy
twelve-pounders, one light twelve-pounder, four light three-pounders, four
royal mortars and twelve co|horns. Left on board the Royal George, two heavy
twenty-four-pounders, two thirteen-inch mortars, two ten-inch mortars, four
eight-inch mortars, four royal mortars and eight cohorns. Sent back to St.
John's in the Radau, fourteen heavy twenty-four-pounders, two eight-inch
howitzers. Left at Fort George, four medium twelve-pounders, two light
&s;ix-pounders, two eight-inch howitzers, two royal howitzers. With Colonel St.
Leger's expedition to Fort Stanwix were &s;ent two light &s;ix-pounders, two
light three-pounders, four cohorns. Left at St. John's, four light
&s;ix-pounders, five light three-pounders, four cohorn mortars: that was the
di&s;tribution of artillery that remained after the army had quitted Fort
George. The quantity of artillery brought forward with the army were four
medium twelve-pounders, two light twenty-four-pounders, eighteen light
&s;ix-pounders, &s;ix light three-pounders, two eighteen-inch howitzers, four
royal howitzers, two eight-inch mortars, four royal mortars.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8.</NOTE>Q. Was not that park artillery,
tho' con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome twenty-four-pounders and &s;ome twelve pounders,
properly field artillery?</P> 
<P>A. They certainly were, and have ever been con&s;idered as
&s;uch on all field &s;ervices. Heavy artillery is of a di&s;tinct nature, and
con&s;iderably heavier than guns of the &s;ame calibre which we had in the
army.</P> 
<P><PB N="68" REF="75"><NOTE PLACE="marg">9.</NOTE>Q. Have you
ever known a le&s;s proportion than the brigaded artillery, which was attached
to the line and to the advanced corps, allotted to the &s;ame num|ber of
troops?</P> 
<P>A. The proportion of field artillery certainly &s;hould vary
both in quantity and nature according to the variety of circum&s;tances under
which the army is to act; the u&s;ual allotment of light field pieces are two
to each battalion; and from a calculation of the number and &s;trength of
General Burgoyne's army, I do not conceive that our light field artillery
exceeded that proportion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">10.</NOTE>Q. What do you apprehend was the
propo&s;ed u&s;e of artillery in the country in which we were to act?</P> 
<P>A. To di&s;lodge the enemy from &s;uch po&s;ts as every where
pre&s;ent them&s;elves in that part of the country, and from which it may be
impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;lodge them without artillery of a more con&s;iderable
calibre than light &s;ix-pounders.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the po&s;ition
which the enemy evacuated at Schuyler's I&s;land?</P> 
<P>A. I do perfectly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.</NOTE>Q. Had that po&s;ition been
maintained, would not artillery of the heavie&s;t nature we had have been
particularly &s;erviceable?</P> 
<P>A. Provided the po&s;t could not have been turned, and the
enemy had made u&s;e of every advantage which the ground gave them, I have no
doubt but the park artillery would have been ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">13.</NOTE>Q. Had the pa&s;&s;age of the
Hud&s;on's River, or of Batten Kill been di&s;puted, would artillery of that
nature have been &s;erviceable?</P> 
<P>A. Doubtle&s;s it would.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">14.</NOTE>Q. Had the enemy taken a
po&s;ition at the Forks of the Mohawk River, would artillery of that nature
have been &s;erviceable?</P> 
<P>A. From the imperfect manner in which I &s;aw that ground, it
appeared ca|pable of being made extremely defen&s;ible, and, of cour&s;e, that
&s;ort of artillery would have been &s;erviceable.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15.</NOTE>Q. Had the army reached Albany,
and it had been found expedient to for|tify a camp there for the winter, would
artillery of that nature have been nece&s;&s;ary?</P> 
<P>A. There can be no doubt of it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">16.</NOTE>Q. What do you apprehend to be
the chief u&s;e of howitzers and &s;mall mortars in the field.</P> 
<P>A. I apprehend they are of infinite &s;ervice again&s;t all
kinds of log work, ab|baties, and again&s;t entrenchments. The &s;mall mortars
are particularly u&s;eful again&s;t redoubts and other works where the enemy
are confined within a &s;mall &s;pace.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17.</NOTE>Q. Are not log works a &s;pecies
of fortification peculiar to that country?</P> 
<P>A. I never &s;aw any el&s;ewhere.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18.</NOTE>Q. Was the carrying forward the
artillery from Lake George to the place where the army cro&s;&s;ed the
Hud&s;on's River any impediment to the tran&s;port of pro|vi&s;ions?</P> 
<P>A. The tran&s;port of our artillery and &s;tores were
con&s;tantly made by hor&s;es <PB N="69" REF="76"> attached to our department,
and therefore I do not conceive it did in any man|ner interfere with the
tran&s;port of provi&s;ions&mdash;I mean to confine my&s;elf in this an&s;wer
to the tran&s;port from Fort George to the Hud&s;on's River; for after
cro&s;|&s;ing the river we had &s;ome oxen and hor&s;es attached to the
&s;ervice of the ar|tillery, which I believe were before employed in bringing
forward provi&s;ions and bateaux.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">19.</NOTE>Q. What time did it take to bring
forward the park artillery from Fort George to the bridge of boats over the
Hud&s;on's River?</P> 
<P>A. The light brigade and the artillery of the park, with their
proper propor|tion of &s;tores and ammunition, had their hor&s;es, carriages,
and drivers con&s;tantly attached to them; it therefore required no more time
to carry tho&s;e &s;tores than was nece&s;&s;ary for the carriages them&s;elves
to pa&s;s from Fort George to the Hud&s;on's River; but with re&s;pect to the
re&s;erve which was afterwards tran&s;|ported by water in bateaux, I believe
two days with all our carriages would ea&s;ily have conveyed them to the
Hud&s;on's River.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the po&s;ition
of the King's troops from the time of the attack on the 19th of September to
the attack on the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. Yes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">21.</NOTE>Q. Had the army made a movement
to gain the left of the enemy's en|trenchments without previou&s;ly
con&s;tructing redoubts on the heights that com|manded the plain, would not the
bateaux, provi&s;ions and ho&s;pital have been left open to an attack from the
enemy's right?</P> 
<P>A. They would have been left expo&s;ed undoubtedly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">22.</NOTE>Q. Were not the large&s;t guns we
had the propere&s;t pieces of artillery for tho&s;e redoubts?</P> 
<P>A. I think it was a &s;ervice that was exactaly adapted to
them.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">23.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the
di&s;po&s;ition made by General Burgoyne on the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. I do.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">24.</NOTE>Q. At what time was you wounded
in that attack? </P> 
<P>A. I believe in about twenty minutes after it commenced.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">25.</NOTE>Q. What circum&s;tance of the
action did you ob&s;erve before you was wound|ed, particularly re&s;pecting the
artillery and the enemy's advancing under the fire of the artillery, and what
happened to the troops po&s;ted immediately on the left of the artillery?</P> 
<P>A. The ground on which the artillery was po&s;ted was a clear
&s;pot, in a great mea&s;ure &s;urrounded by woods, the &s;kirts of which on
our left was di&s;tant about two hundred yards where the attack fir&s;t began.
The two medium twelve-pounders were po&s;ted on a &s;mall eminence, nearly in
the center of this cleared &s;pot between the German picquets and a detachment
of the He&s;&s;e Hanau regi|ment. On the enemy's column approaching, the fire
of the twelve-pounders and the four &s;ixes was immediately directed towards
the enemy's column, notwith|&s;tanding which, they drew up along the &s;kirts
of the wood behind trees, and after driving in the Germans, kept a pretty warm
fire of mu&s;ketry on the guns and the troops po&s;ted about them; &s;oon after
this I heard a firing on the right <PB N="70" REF="77"> towards a cleared
&s;pot, &s;eparated from us by a wood on which the light infan|try were
po&s;ted on very commanding ground. On their retreating, as al&s;o the
twenty-fourth regiment who was drawn up in the wood on our right, the enemy
made their appearance on an eminence on our right, and cut off the retreat of
the ar|tillery&mdash;At this moment I received my wound, and therefore can give
no farther account of the circum&s;tances of that day's action.</P></Q></P>
<P> <HI>Examined by other Members of the Committee.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE>Q. What was the number of
hor&s;es in general employed for the artillery af|ter the march from
Ticonderoga?</P> 
<P>A. The whole number of hor&s;es detached with the Briti&s;h
artillery, previous to the pa&s;&s;ing the Hud&s;on's River, was about four
hundred.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">27.</NOTE>Q. How many would have been
nece&s;&s;ary for the field pieces attached to the battalions only?</P> 
<P>A. Eighteen &s;ix-pounders at four hor&s;es each; &s;ix
three-pounders at three hor&s;es each, and two royal howitzers at three
hor&s;es each: the remainder were for park artillery, ammunition, and &s;tores
of all kinds to accommodate the army on its march.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">28.</NOTE>Q. Was the forage for the&s;e
hor&s;es procured in the country on their march, or brought from a
di&s;tance?</P> 
<P>A. A quantity of oats was brought forward from Canada, but
with re&s;pect to other forage they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of collecting
it in the neighbourhood of the encampment.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">29.</NOTE>Q. How many waggons might the
bringing on that quantity of oats employ?</P> 
<P>A. I believe the quantity of oats after pa&s;&s;ing Fort
Edward was &s;o trifling that I don't believe it loaded one waggon.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">30.</NOTE>Q. After the army arrived at Fort
Edward, did any delay or not ari&s;e to its forward progre&s;s from bringing on
the park artillery, waiting for hor&s;es and dri|vers for that purpo&s;e, or to
provide forage?</P> 
<P>A. The park artillery remained at Fort Edward no longer than
was nece&s;&s;ary during the time the army remained in that neighbourhood: I do
not know of any delay whatever from the want of hor&s;es and drivers. Had the
park artillery moved forwards &s;ooner, no end could have been an&s;wered by
it, before the bridge was thrown over the Hud&s;on's River.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">31.</NOTE>Q. Were there any gun-boats
&s;ent out to Quebec for the campaign 1776?</P> 
<P>A. There were.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">32.</NOTE>Q. Were there a &s;ufficient
number &s;ent out, in your opinion?</P> 
<P>A. It appeared that the naval force was &s;uperior to that of
the rebels, from the event of that engagement; and therefore I conclude, that
for the u&s;es of that cam|paign there were a &s;ufficient number.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">33.</NOTE>Q. Did you apprehend, before the
event of the action on the lakes, that the num|ber was &s;ufficient, and went
out in time?</P> 
<P><PB N="71" REF="78">A. We had received very exaggerated
accounts of the rebel force on the lakes, and therefore uncommon exertions were
u&s;ed to render our force as formidable as po&s;&s;ible; and probably &s;ome
time was lo&s;t, and the campaign in &s;ome degree retarded, from that
circum&s;tance.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">34.</NOTE>Q. Would the campaign have been
retarded &s;o long if a greater number of gun|boats had been &s;ent out?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly not.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">35.</NOTE>Q. What number of artificers were
&s;ent to Canada for the campaign in 1776? </P> 
<P>A. I don't immediately recollect the exact number; but I think
Colonel Chri&s;tie engaged about two hundred. I know of no others being &s;ent
out.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">36.</NOTE>Q. Do you know of more being
a&s;ked for by the artillery or engineers, as nece&s;&s;ary for the

di&s;tance of time I cannot parti|cularly an&s;wer that que&s;tion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">37.</NOTE>Q. Whether the number of
artificers &s;ent out for that campaign were, in any degree, &s;ufficient for
the purpo&s;e of carrying it on?</P> 
<P>A. Certainly not. We were under the nece&s;&s;ity of
collecting all the artificers that could be met with in Canada for the armament

Reide&s;el received his orders or in&s;tructions; but I under&s;tood it was to
create an alarm towards the Con|necticut, to give encouragement to the loyal

</TABLE> The 300 additional did not join the army till the 3d of
September, &s;o that this return is exclu&s;ive of them.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">54.</NOTE>Q. What was the &s;trength of the
artillery and Lieutenant Nutt's corps at that time?</P> 
<P>A. I believe there was very little variation in either of them
from the former return.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">55.</NOTE>Q. Have you General Burgoyne's
application to Sir Guy Carleton for a gar|ri&s;on from Canada for Ticonderoga,
before he pa&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on's River?</P> 
<P>A. I have extracts from letters of General Burgoyne to Sir Guy
Carleton, the 11th of July, 1777, and the 29th of July, 1777.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Ap|pendix.</NOTE></P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">56.</NOTE>Q. Was there any con&s;iderable
alteration in the &s;trength of the army between the return of the 1&s;t of
September, and the action on the 19th?</P> 
<P>A. There was a &s;kirmi&s;h or two, but the lo&s;s was not
material in that in|terval.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">57.</NOTE>Q. In the cour&s;e of the
&s;ervice, did you ever know any in&s;tance of a day of action, where there was
not &s;ome deductions from the effective &s;trength upon pa|per, for baggage
guards, bat-men, care of the &s;ick, and other indi&s;pen&s;ible regimen|tal
contingencies?</P> 
<P>A. I apprehend there mu&s;t always be deductions of that
&s;ort.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">58.</NOTE>Q. In the &s;ervice of our
campaign, was there not a con&s;iderable additional deduction for the care and
defence of the bateaux and movable magazines?</P> 
<P>A. It mu&s;t of cour&s;e make an additional drain from the
army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">59.</NOTE>Q. Was not all we had of the
forty-&s;eventh regiment appropriated to that par|ticular &s;ervice?</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">60.</NOTE>A. It generally was; I believe
always &s;o.</P> 
<P>Q. The&s;e deductions con&s;idered, about what number do you
compute the Bri|ti&s;h line to have con&s;i&s;ted of on the day of the action
of the 19th.</P> 
<P><PB N="79" REF="86">A. I believe the four regiments of the line
engaged that day amounted to lit|tle more than one thou&s;and one hundred men
on the &s;pot under arms in the ac|tion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">61.</NOTE>Q. What lo&s;s did the Briti&s;h
&s;u&s;tain in that action? </P> 
<P>A. Killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners, rather more than le&s;s
than five hundred.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">62.</NOTE>Q. Can you &s;peak particularly to
the lo&s;s of the line? </P> 
<P>A. I believe about &s;eventy-&s;ix killed rank and file, and
between two hundred and forty and two hundred and fifty wounded, and about
twenty-eight or thirty mi&s;&s;ing and pri&s;oners.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">63.</NOTE>Q. Do you recollect the &s;trength
of the 20th regiment when they made their la&s;t charge on the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. I do very well. I was by General Phillips when the orders
were given for that charge; he was then in the front of the line: the ranks
appeared to be very thin, the regiment were much fatigued with the length of
the action, but moved on to the charge with &s;pirit.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">64.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember General Burgoyne
going up to the &s;ixty-&s;econd regiment immediately after the firing
cea&s;ed, and the report that was made to him by the commanding officer of the
&s;tate of that regiment?</P> 
<P>A. I remember it, and the officer reporting the great lo&s;s
they had &s;u&s;tain|ed in the action; I &s;aw them, and they appeared to be
very con&s;iderably reduced in number.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">65.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember the officer
mentioning that they had not above fifty or &s;ixty men in the regiment?</P> 
<P>A. I can't &s;peak po&s;itively to that; but in my own judgment
they did not ex|ceed that number.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">66.</NOTE>Q. Were not both the field-officers
wounded? </P> 
<P>A. Colonel An&s;truther and Major Harnage were both wounded, and
a great many other officers were killed and wounded, and the regiment
&s;uffered greatly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">67.</NOTE>Q. To what degree did the men of
the artillery &s;uffer in that action? </P> 
<P>A. I think, but am not quite certain, that the number that were
with four guns amounted to forty-eight. I &s;aw Captain Jones, who was a very
gallant man, and commanded tho&s;e four guns, killed, and &s;ome other officers
wounded, and I be|lieve about thirty &s;ix of the men were killed and wounded.
I &s;hould in ju&s;tice to the artillery &s;ay, that I think it is not in the
power of men to keep a bet|ter fire, both of round and grape-&s;hot, than was
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively maintained for &s;everal hours that day.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">68.</NOTE>Q. From your experience in the
&s;ervice, do you conceive it would have oc|curred to any officer, to engage
troops, if he could po&s;&s;ibly avoid it, in the &s;itua|tion in which the
Briti&s;h line was the day after that action?</P> 
<P>A. The experience of an officer of my inferior rank does not
lead to much; but I &s;hould have been &s;orry to have given orders to tho&s;e
regiments, after the gallant &s;ufferings of that day, to have attacked an army
reported, both from our &s;pies and our pri&s;oners, to be very near if not
more than four times the num|ber of our whole force: add to this, the country
was a very thick wood, and <PB N="80" REF="87"> the &s;ituation of the rebel
camp, I believe, could not by any means be recon|noitred within that &s;pace of
time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">69.</NOTE> Q</P> 
<P>Do you remember General Burgoyne receiving a letter from Sir
Henry Clinton the day but one after that action, informing him, that he
intended about that time an attack on Fort Montgomery?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember his receiving a letter from Sir Henry Clinton
about that time; it was the 22d of September.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">70.</NOTE>Q. Do you imagine that any officer
knowing of that letter would have enter|tained thoughts of immediately renewing
an attack upon the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. As far as an opinion of an officer of my inferior rank goes,
I &s;hould not have thought of it, nor did I hear any officer of any rank
expre&s;s &s;uch an idea at that time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">71.</NOTE>Q. From what you knew of the
country, did you not believe that a &s;uc|ce&s;sful attack from Sir Henry
Clinton during the time we lay at that camp, would either have di&s;lodged
General Gates entirely, or have obliged him to de|tach con&s;iderably from his
army?</P> 
<P>A. I remember our &s;couts giving information, that a bridge was
laid over the Hud&s;on's River, very near the enemy's camp; and it was the
opinion of &s;ome very confidential men that were employed in that army in that
capacity, and were much under the direction of General Fra&s;er, that on the
approach of Sir Henry Clinton's army, the army of Mr. Gates could not &s;tand
us, but would cro&s;s the river, and go towards New England. Whether the idea
was right or wrong, I can't tell.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">72.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever hear &s;uch
per&s;ons, or any others, expre&s;s an idea, that the enemy would have taken
the &s;ame mea&s;ure on our advancing to attack them without that
co-operation?</P> 
<P>A. I don't remember to have heard any &s;uch thing.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">73.</NOTE>Q. Do you imagine that any officer
knowing of Sir Henry Clinton's letters, would have thought it proper to retreat
after the action of the 19th of Sep|tember?</P> 
<P>A. I never heard any officer expre&s;s an idea of that &s;ort. I
don't know what officers might be within the knowledge of &s;uch a letter; but
I lived intimate|ly with General Phillips, General Fra&s;er, and with Mr.
Twi&s;s, the engineer; whether the letter was in their knowledge or not, I
don't know: but I never heard them expre&s;s &s;uch an idea.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">74.</NOTE>Q. Did you ever hear any officer of
that army, though unacquainted with the letter, before or &s;ince the time,
expre&s;s a di&s;approbation of the mea&s;ure of remaining in that camp without
either attacking or retreating?</P> 
<P>A. Neither then or at any time while I remained in America, and
of cour&s;e not &s;ince.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">75.</NOTE>Q. From your conver&s;ation with
the chief engineer, and from other circum|&s;tances, have you rea&s;on to know,
that every po&s;&s;ible means were u&s;ed after the action of the 19th, to
obtain a knowledge of the ground on the enemy's left?</P> 
<P><PB N="81" REF="88">A. I had frequent conver&s;ations with the
chief engineer on that &s;ubject. I be|lieve his attention was given to that
point almo&s;t every day, and a knowledge of that ground I under&s;tood to be
very difficult to be obtained.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">76.</NOTE>Q. Was not the right of the enemy
deemed impracticable. </P> 
<P>A. I had no opportunity my&s;elf of &s;eeing the right of the
enemy; but I un|der&s;tood from others, that the po&s;ition was too &s;trong to
be attacked with any pro|&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">77.</NOTE>Q. Were there not frequent
con&s;ultations held between General Burgoyne, Ge|neral Phillips and General
Fra&s;er, previous to the movement up to the enemy on the 7th of October?</P> 
<P>A. I under&s;tood there was &s;carce a day pa&s;&s;ed without
&s;uch con&s;ultation; I be|lieve no day after the action of the 19th.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">78.</NOTE>Q. Did you conceive that the chief
purpo&s;e of that movement was to attain a knowledge of the left of the enemy's
po&s;ition, and if expedient to attack them there?</P> 
<P>A. I under&s;tood it was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">79.</NOTE>Q. Did it appear to you, that the
force left in camp, under General Hamil|ton, was more than &s;ufficient to keep
the enemy in check?</P> 
<P>A. I don't think it was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">80.</NOTE>Q. From the intimacy and confidence
in which you lived with General Bur|goyne and General Fra&s;er, do you imagine
any di&s;agreement of opinion could have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them without
your knowledge?</P> 
<P>A. I think I mu&s;t have heard of it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">81.</NOTE>Q. Do you know any in&s;tance, but
more e&s;pecially re&s;pecting the periods of pa&s;&s;ing the Hud&s;on's River,
the action of the 19th of September, and that of the 7th of October, wherein
General Fra&s;er expre&s;&s;ed a di&s;approbation of Gene|ral Burgoyne's
mea&s;ures?</P> 
<P>A. I do not: but I would beg leave to ob&s;erve, that upon the
plan to Bennington, General Fra&s;er had expre&s;&s;ed a different opinion,
with re&s;pect to em|ploying the Germans. At the time of pa&s;&s;ing the
Hud&s;on's River, and after it was cro&s;&s;ed, I had a great deal of
conver&s;ation with General Fra&s;er: he &s;eemed to expre&s;s &s;atisfaction
in the manner in which the troops had pa&s;&s;ed.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">82.</NOTE>Q. In the action of the 7th of
October, after the German troops on the left of the artillery had given way,
did you ob&s;erve General Phillips and General Reide&s;el in per&s;on?</P> 
<P>A. I was with General Phillips at different times, and I &s;aw
General Reide|&s;el more than once; they were both very active, and exerted
them&s;elves very much to form the broken troops, and to make the retreat as
regular as the cir|cum&s;tances would permit.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">83.</NOTE>Q. What was the la&s;t time you
&s;aw Sir Francis Clarke in that action, and do you know what orders he was
carrying?</P> 
<P>A. It was after the retreat was become very general. Sir Francis
Clarke a&s;ked me, if I had given any orders to the artillery to retreat? I
told him, that as there was a major-general of the artillery in the field, who
was confe&s;&s;ed by the army to be a very excellent officer, I would not take
on my&s;elf, as ad|jutant-general, <PB N="82" REF="89"> to give orders to any
part of the artillery. Sir Francis Clarke told me, that a di&s;po&s;ition had
been made for a general retreat, and that he was going with orders from General
Burgoyne to bring off the artillery. About the in&s;tant we were parting, a
very heavy fire came upon us from the enemy, and I have &s;ince had rea&s;on to
believe, that Sir Francis Clarke received his wound at that time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">84.</NOTE>Q. On the day of the 8th, do you
remember the enemy forming a line in the meadows, and making a demon&s;tration
of attacking us?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember it very well, and that there was a great deal
of cannonading from the enemy.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">85.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember al&s;o a
cannonading in the afternoon, about the time of General Fra&s;er's funeral?</P>

<P>A. I think I &s;hall never forget that circum&s;tance. General
Fra&s;er, I under|&s;tood had de&s;ired to be buried privately, in one of the
redoubts that had been rai&s;ed for the protection of our magazines and
&s;tores; as the corp&s;e was pa&s;&s;ing by, General Burgoyne, General
Phillips, and I believe General Reide&s;el, and &s;everal other officers, out
of re&s;pect to General Fra&s;er's memory, and to do him honour in the eyes of
the army, notwith&s;tanding his reque&s;t, attended his fune|ral into the
redoubt. The enemy were in this in&s;tance, I thought, very defec|tive in point
of humanity; they pointed a gun or two at that very redoubt, and kept up a
bri&s;k cannonade during the whole of the funeral &s;ervice, which was
performed with great &s;olemnity and very deliberately by Mr. Brudenel, the
chaplain. I never &s;aw &s;o affecting a &s;ight.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">86.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember on the march to
Saratoga &s;eeing a corps of the enemy at work on the plain of Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. I do very well; a working party, and what appeared to be a
battalion or more drawn up as a covering party.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">87.</NOTE>Q. Was that the corps that
afterwards took po&s;t on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river?</P> 
<P>A. I believe it was the &s;ame corps I &s;aw afterwards
pa&s;&s;ing the ford.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">88.</NOTE>Q. After the arrival of the army at
Saratoga, was Lieutenant Colonel Suther|land detached with a command to cover a
party of workmen to repair bridges and roads, in order to continue the retreat
on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river?</P> 
<P>A. He was ordered with a party to repair bridges and roads on
the we&s;t &s;ide.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">89.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember on what account
Colonel Sutherland and the party were recalled?</P> 
<P>A. I believe it was on information given by our &s;couts, that
the enemy were preparing to attack us in great force.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">90.</NOTE>Q. Have you further rea&s;on to
know that a geneaal attack on that day was really intended by the enemy?</P> 
<P>A. There was particular caution &s;ent round to all the troops
to be prepared for that attack, as it was expected it would be attempted under
cover of a very thick fog then prevailing. After the convention had taken
place, a gene|ral officer in the rebel &s;ervice acquainted me, that &s;uch an
attack was intended, <PB N="83" REF="90"> and from information, I believe from
de&s;erters, or from their own &s;couts, that our army was exceedingly well
prepared to receive them, that they would be very much expo&s;ed when they came
on the plain to our artillery, he not only re|treated with his command, but
&s;ent word to another general officer to retreat al&s;o. The other general
officer was his &s;enior; but he had taken that upon him, from the fear of the
con&s;equences of &s;uch an attack, of which he &s;ent word to General Gates,
who approved and confirmed his order.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">91.</NOTE>Q. Previous to the council of war
to which the field officers were called, do you remember it being determined in
the council of the generals, to try a night march, abandoning the carriages and
baggage, and orders being given for the delivery of as much provi&s;ions as the
men could carry?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember &s;uch a determination very well.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">92.</NOTE>Q. What prevented the execution of
it? </P> 
<P>A. I under&s;tood there were &s;uch difficulties in getting out
the provi&s;ions, that the delivery of the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions could not
be accompli&s;hed.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">93.</NOTE>Q. Had we intelligence the next day
from different &s;couts, that the enemy was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
country in force, on both &s;ides the Hud&s;on's River, between us and Fort
Edward?</P> 
<P>A. I under&s;tood, from &s;ome of the &s;couts that we had been
accu&s;tomed mo&s;t to depend on, that the enemy were &s;o po&s;ted.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">94.</NOTE>Q. Have you rea&s;on to know that
the intelligence General Burgoyne &s;tated to the council of war on this
&s;ubject was true?</P> 
<P>A. I was a&s;&s;ured by one of the general officers who
conducted us towards Bo&s;ton that troops of theirs were in the po&s;ition that
our &s;couts had given us information of.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">95.</NOTE>Q. Did you learn at the &s;ame time
at what period tho&s;e po&s;ts were taken up by the enemy, whether before or
after our arrival at Saratoga?</P> 
<P>A. I have extracts of minutes made at that time, from the mouth
of the ge|neral officer I mentioned.</P>

<P>When the king's army was returning to Saratoga, a

<P>There might be people recovered from their wounds who were di&s;charged
from the ho&s;pital, and had joined the corps; or there might have been a
mi&s;take in the return, ju&s;t before the convention, in the confu&s;ion of
the army at that time.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">103.</NOTE>Q. Do you remember what pa&s;&s;ed
re&s;pecting the military che&s;t, while the treaty of Saratoga was
depending?</P> 
<P>A. I do remember that it was &s;trongly recommended to the commanding
officers of corps to take &s;ums of money from the payma&s;ter general, on
account of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence then due to their regiments; and I believe a great
deal of money was &s;o di&s;tributed, and regularly accounted for to the
payma&s;ter general on the &s;ub&s;equent &s;ettlement of the pay of the
army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">104.</NOTE>Q. What became of the re&s;t of the money
in the military che&s;t? </P> 
<P>A. It was taken by the payma&s;ter general to Albany.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">105.</NOTE>Q. Did any part of it fall into the hands
of the enemy? </P> 
<P>A. Not a &s;hilling that I ever heard of.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">106.</NOTE>Q. Was any proportion of it lo&s;t,
embezzled, or &s;ecreted? </P> 
<P>A. If any &s;uch thing had happened, I think the payma&s;ter general
would have applied to me immediately. Never having heard, then or at any time
after, of any lo&s;s having been &s;u&s;tained, I do not believe there was any
lo&s;s &s;uffered in the retreat or after it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">107.</NOTE>Q. Was the &s;ecret &s;ervice account,
during the campaign, kept by you? </P> 
<P>A. It was.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">108.</NOTE>Q. Could you produce the &s;everal
articles of that account, if called on for it?</P> 
<P>A. I have either a copy of it at home of my own, or from the payma&s;ter
general.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">109.</NOTE>Q. Did General Burgoyne ever appropriate
any part of that expenditure to the extraordinaries of his own expences, or to
any other purpo&s;e for his own u&s;e?</P> 
<P>A. Never that I know of.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">110.</NOTE>Q. Mu&s;t not you have known it if it had
been &s;o? </P> 
<P>A. Certainly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">111.</NOTE>Q. Were there not occa&s;ions where
General Burgoyne paid, from his own pur&s;e, expences that, in the opinion of
others, he might have been ju&s;tified in placing to the public account?</P> 
<P><PB N="86" REF="93">A. I remember to have been told by other gentlemen,
that expences of that &s;ort General Burgoyne had been at, ought to have been
charged in that manner.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">112.</NOTE>Q. What was the nature of tho&s;e
expences?</P> 
<P>A. They were pre&s;ents to people who had di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves, and in acts of charity to women who had lo&s;t their hu&s;bands,
and other occa&s;ions which it was very proper for a general officer to give,
and very proper to put into a public account.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">113.</NOTE>Q. Had not General Burgoyne, from his
&s;ituation, all the expences attending a Commander in Chief?</P> 
<P>A. He certainly had, from being obliged to keep a public table for the
entertain|ment and refre&s;hment of officers and others coming to head
quarters, on duty or bu&s;ine&s;s; and I know tho&s;e expences to have been
very great, from the exceeding high price of all the articles of life in that
part of the world.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">114.</NOTE>Q. Did General Burgoyne ever receive more
than the appointment of a lieutenant general?</P> 
<P>A. Never.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">115.</NOTE>Q. Was there not a board of general
officers appointed at Cambridge, to in&s;pect all the accounts of the campaign;
and did not General Burgoyne regulate the pay|ment of the battalions by the
report of that board?</P> 
<P>A. There was &s;uch a board, and the payments were regulated according
to the report of that board.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">116.</NOTE>Q. Upon the whole of what you know of
General Burgoyne's receipts and expences, do you believe he was, in his own
pur&s;e, a gainer or a &s;ufferer in the campaign 1777?</P> 
<P>A. I really believe his appointments were not equal to his expences in
that campaign.</P></Q></P>
<P> <HI>Examined by other Members of the Committee and by General Burgoyne
occa&s;ionally.</HI> 
<Q> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">117.</NOTE>Q. What were the numbers of the effective
Briti&s;h, at the opening of the cam|paign 1777, including officers and
non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers?</P> 
<P>A. I have not tho&s;e returns; but they were &s;ent to the Commander in
Chief, and my extracts are for the rank and file.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">118.</NOTE>Q. Can you an&s;wer that que&s;tion with
re&s;pect to the Germans?</P> 
<P>A. My extracts are the &s;ame both for the Briti&s;h and the
Germans.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">119.</NOTE>Q. What was the greate&s;t number of
Provincials in the army at any time in the campaign?</P> 
<P>A. I believe the only que&s;tion that has been a&s;ked re&s;pecting them
was at the be|ginning of the campaign; they were then eighty-three. On the
fir&s;t of September they amounted to about &s;ix hundred and eighty, which was
the greate&s;t number they ever amounted to.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">120.</NOTE>Q. What do you mean by Provincials?</P> 
<P><PB N="87" REF="94">A. I under&s;tand them to be inhabitants of that
country, a&s;&s;embled under officers who were to have had different
commi&s;&s;ions, provided they had ever amounted to certain numbers.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">121.</NOTE>Q. Do you include Canadians under the name
of Provincials? </P> 
<P>A. I believe, in the former part of my evidence, the Canadians were
&s;tated to be one hundred and forty-eight, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from the
Provincials.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">122.</NOTE>Q. Was General Burgoyne's &s;econd order
of the twelfth of July, relating to the baggage, &s;trictly complied with?</P> 
<P>A. I conceive it was the duty of the commanding officers of regiments to
enforce an ob&s;ervance and obedience to the general orders.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">123.</NOTE>Q. Was it actually enforced in &s;uch a
manner to the degree you thought it &s;hould have been?</P> 
<P>A. I am not quite po&s;itive whether there was not another order
i&s;&s;ued after|wards.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">124.</NOTE><STAGE>[Que&s;tion repeated.]</STAGE></P> 
<P>A. I never had any report made to me by a commanding officer of any
corps, of that order not being complied with.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">125.</NOTE>Q. What was your own ocular ob&s;ervation
of the quantity of baggage carried with the army; and did it appear to you that
that order could have been fairly com|plied with?</P> 
<P>A. I own I don't recollect, not hearing any complaint nor attending to
it. The quarter ma&s;ter general of the army mu&s;t naturally know more of the
baggage than the adjutant general.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">126.</NOTE>Q. Do you know what allowance of waggons
was made to a regiment? </P> 
<P>A. I don't recollect any waggons that we had to allow.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">127.</NOTE>Q. Was none of the baggage brought down in
wheeled carriages? </P> 
<P>A. Several officers, I believe, bought waggons and carts of the country
people for their own u&s;e; but I do not remember any of the king's carts or
waggons being appropriated to the carriage of officers' baggage. It might be,
but I don't recollect it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">128.</NOTE>Q. Can you &s;ay, in a general way, how
many hor&s;es might be employed in car|rying the baggage of the army, including
officers' hor&s;es?</P> 
<P>A. I never had any information upon that &s;ubject; it did not belong to
my de|partment, and I had much bu&s;ine&s;s on my hands.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">129.</NOTE>Q. How was the regimental baggage
carried?</P> 
<P>A. I believe chiefly in bateaux.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">130.</NOTE>Q. How was it carried when there was no
water-carriage? </P> 
<P>A. I can't &s;peak to that point, having had no information on that
&s;ubject; and when I &s;peak of bateaux, I &s;peak generally, having
<HI>had</HI> no information on the &s;ubject.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">131.</NOTE>Q. Can you &s;ay, in a general way, how
many women attended the army?</P> 
<P>A. I had really &s;o much to do that I had not much lei&s;ure to pay
much attention to the ladies; and I know very little of their beauty or their
numbers.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">132.</NOTE>Q. Would not the feeding of two thou&s;and
women be a con&s;iderable object with re&s;pect to the provi&s;ions of the
army?</P> 
<P><PB N="88" REF="95">A. I &s;hould have been very &s;orry to have had two
thou&s;and women to have experienced that.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">133.</NOTE>Q. How many women were there, if not two
thou&s;and?</P> 
<P>A. I would wi&s;h to give the hou&s;e every information in my power, whe
n ca n &s;peak with any degree of accuracy or tolerable gue&s;s. I have &s;een
the commi&s;|&s;ary of provi&s;ions return, and I think the number of women
returned, as victualled from the &s;tores, were very very few.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">134.</NOTE>Q. Do you think that a corps of dragoons
mounted would have been of great u&s;e to the army?</P> 
<P>A. I own, I very much wi&s;hed tho&s;e few dragoons we had could have
been mounted, becau&s;e, though in that part of America that I &s;aw they might
not have been nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful to have made a charge, I think tho&s;e
light dragoons might be always applied to very u&s;eful &s;ervices.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">135.</NOTE>Q. How many had you of tho&s;e
dragoons?</P> 
<P>A. They are included in the &s;trength of the Germans, and I really do
not re|member their particular number.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">136.</NOTE>Q. If none or le&s;s of the park of
artillery had been brought forward, would there not have been hor&s;es to have
mounted tho&s;e dragoons?</P> 
<P>A. I believe there might have been hor&s;es enough taken from the
artillery, or from the provi&s;ion train, to have mounted tho&s;e dragoons, if
it had been thought more expedient to have employed the hor&s;es in that
manner; but they were hired or contracted for, for the &s;pecial purpo&s;es of
carrying provi&s;ions, and bringing on the artillery, and never meant by the
per&s;ons who furni&s;hed the contract for the dra|goon &s;ervice.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">137.</NOTE>Q. If a &s;maller quantity of baggage had
been carried, might not the officers have &s;pared &s;ome of their baggage
hor&s;es for mounting the dragoons?</P> 
<P>A. I never met with an officer who had hor&s;es to &s;pare. I know Sir
Francis Clarke and my&s;elf wi&s;hed to buy hor&s;es to carry our own
&s;ervants; cared very little what expence we were at, and yet I could not
obtain any.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">138.</NOTE>Q. Do you know of any corps or party
finding their way back to Ca|nada?</P> 
<P>A. I never heard of any corps finding its way there; and I under&s;tood
from the guides who were with us, previous to the convention's taking place,
that if that was attempted, we mu&s;t break into &s;mall parties, and go by
what is called Indian paths.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">139.</NOTE>Q. Suppo&s;ing there was a &s;mall party
that found its way to Canada by In|dian paths, do you think it would have been
po&s;&s;ible for an army to have done the &s;ame?</P> 
<P>A. My idea of that mu&s;t be founded upon the report of tho&s;e guides
who had &s;erved us very faithfully as &s;couts upon former occa&s;ions, and
who inform|ed me that we mu&s;t break into very &s;mall parties, to have any
chance of mak|ing our way through the woods to Canada; and I remember that when
General Phillips offered to attempt to find his way to Ticonderoga, it was
talked of and looked on to be as de&s;perate as gallant.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">140.</NOTE>Q. If any party did make its way to
Canada, do you not &s;uppo&s;e it mu&s;t <PB N="89" REF="96"> be that party of
provincials that ran away while they were employed to repair roads, and that
were never heard of afterwards?</P> 
<P>A. I remember &s;ome were reported to have run away who were making
roads, and it is likely to have been that party.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">141.</NOTE>Q. When you mentioned the highe&s;t number
of provincials, did you mean that they were all armed?</P> 
<P>A. I know that they were not all armed. We had not arms for them.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">142.</NOTE>Q. Of tho&s;e that were armed, &s;ome
re&s;pectable per&s;ons excepted, were they much to be depended upon?</P> 
<P>A. A very great part of them were &s;uch as I &s;hould have placed very
little de|pendence upon.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">143.</NOTE>Q. Before the army left Canada, was there
not a &s;trict order, that not more than three women a company &s;hould be
&s;uffered to embark?</P> 
<P>A. I do know there was &s;uch an order i&s;&s;ued, and I never heard any
com|plaint of its having been broke through. I don't recollect the date of that
or|der, or I would have turned to my book, and &s;tated to the hou&s;e, upon
the fir&s;t que&s;tion relative to the number of women that were employed on
our ex|pedition.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">144.</NOTE>Q. Is it not the cu&s;tom in all armies
victualled from the king's &s;tores, to pro|hibit the delivery of provi&s;ions
to any women over and above the number allowed by order?</P> 
<P>A. It was cu&s;tomary in all places where I &s;erved in the la&s;t war,
and very &s;trong and peremptory orders were given on that &s;ubject to the
commi&s;&s;aries in our army.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">145.</NOTE>Q. Do you not then believe, that all women
who followed your army were fed from the ration of the men they followed, or
found their provi&s;ion in the country?</P> 
<P>A. I remember, upon a&s;king the commi&s;&s;aries how there came to be
&s;o few women in the provincial returns, I was told, it was the cu&s;tom for
them to be &s;upplied out of the men's rations.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">146.</NOTE>Q. Were the women conveyed on baggage
carts or hor&s;es, or did they walk a-foot?</P> 
<P>A. I never heard of the women's being conveyed on baggage carts or the
king's hor&s;es.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">147.</NOTE>Q. If the women neither employed the
king's hor&s;es, nor con&s;umed his pro|vi&s;ions, do you think they were more
of impediment, or of comfort to the king's troops?</P> 
<P>A. I never under&s;tood from my conver&s;ation with the commanding
officers, or others, that the women were any impediment.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">148.</NOTE>Q. If after the taking of Ticonderoga
there was any doubt in the army in which you &s;erved, of their being able to
reach Albany?</P> 
<P>A. I don't remember to have heard any doubts expre&s;&s;ed upon that
&s;ubject, mean|ing &s;oon after the taking Ticonderoga.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">149.</NOTE>Q. Was it generally under&s;tood in the
army, that it was was well &s;upplied with all the nece&s;&s;aries,
appointments for war, and articles proper for forwarding the expedition to
Albany?</P> 
<P><PB N="90" REF="97">A. I always under&s;tood that the army had been very
well &s;upplied with every thing.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">150.</NOTE>Q. Do you believe, if the &s;ecretary of
&s;tate had ordered the army under Ge|neral Howe to co-operate with the army
under General Burgoyne for the North River, with a view to have formed the
junction of the two armies, that the di&s;a&s;ter which befel General
Burgoyne's army could have happened?</P> 
<P>A. If a junction could have been formed, I &s;hould apprehend that Mr.
Gates's army might have been di&s;lodged, and that the misfortune at Saratoga
would not have happened. This is only matter of opinion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">151.</NOTE>Q. Do you apprehend, that if the army
under Sir William Howe had ope|rated on the North River, with a view to effect
a junction, that &s;uch a junc|tion would have taken place?</P> 
<P>A. I had an opinion while in America, that if the expedition which came
up the Hud&s;on's River under General Vaughan, could have have been there about
the time of our action of the 19th of September, that Mr. Gates would have
found it difficult to have kept his army together, if he had not cro&s;&s;ed
over the Hud&s;on's River towards New England. But this is mere matter of
private opinion.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">152.</NOTE>Q. If you are of opinion, that the troops
under General Vaughan would have had &s;o powerful an effect, even &s;o late as
September, what effect do you think Sir William Howe's army, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
all the fleet and craft, would have had as early as the beginning of July,
immediately after the impre&s;&s;ion which took place among the enemy after the
defeat at Ticonderoga?</P> 
<P>A. I did not know what force there was under the command of General
Vaughan, nor do I even now know; but I &s;hould think mo&s;t certainly, that a
great army upon the Hud&s;on's River near Albany, would have contributed very
much to our making our way to Albany.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">153.</NOTE>Q. Have you ever con&s;idered what were
the cau&s;es of the failure of the ex|pedition under General Burgoyne, and to
what do you impute it?</P> 
<P>A. I looked upon our force not to be equal to the forcing our way to
Al|bany without &s;ome co-operation.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">154.</NOTE>Q. Where then did you expect that
co-operation?</P> 
<P>A. I had no where to expect it from, but up the Hud&s;on's River from
New York; and the &s;ucce&s;s of Colonel St. Leger's expedition would have been
of u&s;e certainly.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">155.</NOTE>Q. If General Wa&s;hington's army had not
been diverted, would it not have impeded, or &s;topped the progre&s;s of any
army up the Hud&s;on's River.</P> 
<P>A. I don't know the &s;trength of General Wa&s;hington's army, nor the
nature of the country between Albany and New York; and therefore I cannot form
any judgment of what would have happened.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">156.</NOTE>Q. Are you not of opinion that there are
very &s;trong pa&s;&s;es or po&s;ts on that river?</P> 
<P>A. I found them very &s;trong between Ticonderoga and Albany, and from
re|ports of military men of high reputation in the &s;ervice, I have
under&s;tood there were many very &s;trong po&s;ts between New York and
Albany.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">157.</NOTE>Q. From whence is the account of the
&s;trength of Mr. Gates's army taken?</P> 
<P><PB N="91" REF="98">A. From a return voluntarily given by General Gates
to me for my own &s;atis|faction when at Albany, and that return was &s;igned
by General Gartes.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">158.</NOTE>Q. Have you that return? </P> 
<P>A. I gave it to General Burgoyne; I &s;aw it to-day; he has it.</P> 
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">159.</NOTE>Q. Was it by con&s;ent of General Gates
that the &s;oldiers after the convention re|tained their cartouch-boxes?</P> 
<P>A. They retained their belts, and I really don't recollect whether their
car|touch boxes were in general retained or not: but talking with Mr. Gates
when the king's troops marched by with the accoutrements on, Mr Gates a&s;ked
me (we had been old acquaintance formerly) whether it was not cu&s;tomary on
field days for arms and accoutrements to go together? I told him, there was
nothing &s;aid in the convention that I had agreed to with him relating to the
accou|trements, and that he could have no right to any thing but what was
&s;tipulated in that treaty. He replied, 
<Q REND="inline">"You are perfectly right;"</Q> and turned to &s;ome of
the officers in their &s;ervice by, and &s;aid,

<HEAD>Review of the Evidence; its &s;everal Parts compared with the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The conduct of Lord G. Germain, during the

has, in a great mea|&s;ure, deprived me of the benefit of a reply, properly
&s;o called, becau&s;e he has produced no defence. His Lord&s;hip certainly has
been accu&s;ed by me in many in&s;tances of a very &s;erious nature. If he is
really willing that his political, and my military conduct &s;hould be tried by
facts alone, I certainly have not &s;hewn le&s;s incli|nation than his
Lord&s;hip for that te&s;t; but, taxed as I avow he has been by me, with
proceedings derogatory to the obligations which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between
man and man, I really expected, as I believe did the Hou&s;e of Commons and the
public, to have heard from him &s;ome ju&s;tification in tho&s;e re&s;pects.
In&s;tead of that, the noble Lord, in opening the &s;ubjects to which he
propo&s;ed to call evidence, touched &s;o &s;lightly upon the branch of the
enquiry in which we are parties, that a &s;tranger would hardly have thought
there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a di&s;pute between us. His Lord&s;hip contradicted
nothing that I have alledged re&s;pecting his conduct or my own; he &s;tated no
circum|&s;tance of blame again&s;t me, except he meant as &s;uch the enterprize
of Bennington, which he qualified with the epithet "fatal," and pronounced to
be the cau&s;e of all the &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes. He pa&s;&s;ed entirely
over the tran&s;actions at Saratoga. Of forty officers or more, belonging to
the Convention troops, then in England, one only was propo&s;ed to be called on
his Lord&s;hip's part, <HI>viz.</HI> Lieutenant Colonel Sutherland, of the 47th
regiment, upon parole from the Congre&s;s, and acting with a corps of the
Fencible Men in North Britain; but, upon further reflection, his Lord|&s;hip
thought proper to di&s;pen&s;e with the attendance of this officer; and the
only witne&s;s under order of the Hou&s;e was Mr. Skene. No man was better
qualified to give an account of the proceedings at Bennington; and I heartily

imagined would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to occupy them, were &s;pecified merely to
&s;hew that the number of 3000 was indi&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite for the
defence of the province. The whole of that detail con|curred with General
Carleton's requi&s;itions for reinforcement, and with my rea&s;oning upon
tho&s;e requi&s;itions; and when I a&s;&s;ert, as I now do, that I never
pre&s;umed to &s;ugge&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of forming a detail of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apology for &s;pecifying corps.</NOTE>I thought it a

imputation of delay, till I &s;hould be clear of the province of Quebec. With
an unfeigned confidence in Sir Guy Carle|ton, I thought it a precaution fully

rather than by extract. Tho&s;e purpo&s;es were various; but it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed one, and only one, good effect may re&s;ult from a review of
them, viz. It may &s;erve as a &s;alutary caution to any officer, who &s;hall

that forcible arm, the enemy invariably quit|ted their entrenchments, either to
retreat, or fight upon ground where they &s;uppo&s;ed artillery could be

preci&s;ely that which the main body of the army took under me in per&s;on, and
with &s;uch effect, as to come up with the rear of the enemy and drive them
from their fortified po&s;t at Skene&s;borough, with the lo&s;s on their part
of five armed ve&s;&s;els and all the re&s;t of their water-craft.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, this part of the cro&s;s-examination, though

taken notice of in my narrative, viz.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Guy Car|leton, que&s;t. 9, 10.</NOTE>I
&s;hall not recapitulate the various motives I have before &s;tated in
&s;upport of that preference, having publickly in my favour the opinion of an
officer &s;o enlightened in military &s;cience, and &s;o well acquainted with
the country as Sir Guy Carleton;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o the map of

4 to que&s;t. 11. Lieut. Col. King&s;ton, que&s;t. 23.</NOTE>I therefore
&s;hall only add two &s;hort remarks; the one, that the fact of gaining
con&s;iderable time by allotting the whole &s;ervice of the water-craft to the
tran&s;port of provi&s;ion and &s;tores over Lake George, in&s;tead of
employing great part of it for the tran&s;port of the troops is inconte&s;tably
proved by the evidence of Cap|tain Money and Lieutenant Colonel King&s;ton: the
other, that to have reached Fort Edward with the troops &s;ooner than the 29th
of July (the day that the fir&s;t em|barkation of provi&s;ions arrived at Fort
George) would not only have been u&s;ele&s;s, but al&s;o highly impolitic;
becau&s;e the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the troops at Fort Edward, be|fore the
arrival of that embarkation, mu&s;t have been brought by land carriage through
much difficult road all the way from Fort Anne, when, on the contrary, by
remaining in the neighbourhood of Skene&s;borough till the pa&s;&s;age of Lake
George was effected, exclu&s;ively of the con&s;iderations of covering the
removal of the ho|&s;pital of Huberton, and alarming the Connecticut by the
po&s;ition of General Reide|&s;el's corps, the army was commodiou&s;ly
&s;upplied by water-carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="104"> The next circum&s;tance for examination,
according to the order of the Narrative, is the tran&s;port of the magazines of
provi&s;ions, &amp;c. from Fort George; and it is highly incumbent upon me to
&s;hew the difficulties of that operation, becau&s;e, if they were avoidable,
it mu&s;t be acknowledged one of the principal grounds upon which I vindicate
the plan of the expedition to Bennington will fail me.</P>
<P>But I am per&s;uaded, every candid examiner will fir&s;t indulge me
in a &s;hort pau&s;e. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The charges brought again&s;t the Lt. General's
conduct at this part of the cam|paign.</NOTE>It will be recollected, that this
is the only part of the campaign upon which the no|ble Lord has laid his
finger, as judging it productive of the &s;ub&s;equent events. The
cro&s;s-examination had already been pre&s;&s;ed upon the &s;ame ideas. Such
want of know|ledge of the nature of tran&s;port in that country has been
betrayed; &s;o much prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of unnece&s;&s;ary delays has
appeared; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Survey of his difficulties and

more comprehen|&s;ive and complete &s;urvey of the difficulties and anxieties
of my &s;ituation than I thought was nece&s;&s;ary before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feeding the army.</NOTE>The combination of
arrangement for feeding the army might, in fact, be &s;tated to have extended
even to Ireland; for &s;ome part of the &s;upply depended upon the vic|tualling
fleet which was prepared in that country, according to my requi&s;ition before
I left London, and had not reached Quebec when the army took the field. The
te|diou&s;ne&s;s of the navigation from Quebec to the mouth of the Sorel need
not be again de&s;cribed. The next embarra&s;&s;ment was to manage the
conveyance for that part of the &s;upply which came from Montreal, and which
was much the greate&s;t, without interfering with the tran&s;port which with
equal nece&s;&s;ity was to be expedited up the Saint Lawrence to Lake Ontario,
for the &s;ervice of Colonel St. Leger's expedition, and the immen&s;e &s;tores
(then nece&s;&s;arily upon the move al&s;o) for the winter main|tenance of the
upper country. To the&s;e might be added a li&s;t of chances and
incon|veniences, incident to the carrying places between Chambl&eacute;e and
Saint John's; the uncertaintainty afterwards of the pa&s;&s;age over Lake
Champlain, and Lake George; the laborious and &s;low operations of drawing the
boats over the i&s;thmus which di|vides the two Lakes. The&s;e together make a
&s;y&s;tem of embarra&s;&s;ments and di&s;ap|pointments hardly to be conceived
by tho&s;e who have not experienced them:</P>
<P>But although the whole of this arrangement (the furni&s;hing the
upper country ex|cepted) was made under my direction, I have been content to
date my difficulties from the lodgement of the &s;upplies at Fort George; and I
have touched the other parts only to &s;hew more per&s;picuou&s;ly the
unfairne&s;s of judging of an American cam|paign upon European ideas. How
zealou&s;ly &s;oever a general, in &s;uch an undertak|ing as mine, may be
&s;erved by the chiefs of departments (and much prai&s;e is due 
<PB N="99" REF="105"> from me upon that &s;core) for one hour he can find to
contemplate <HI>how he &s;hall fight his army, he mu&s;t allot twenty to
contrive how to feed it.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Behaviour of the Indians.</NOTE>The behaviour of
the Indians is a circum&s;tance too material to be pa&s;&s;ed over in a review
of the anxieties in this part of the campaign. I had di&s;cerned the caprice,
the &s;uper&s;tition, the &s;elf-intere&s;tedne&s;s of the Indian character
from my fir&s;t intercour&s;e, even with tho&s;e nations which are &s;uppo&s;ed
to have made the greate&s;t progre&s;s towards civilization: I mean with
tho&s;e called the domiciliated nations near Montreal. I had been taught to
look upon the remote tribes who joined me at Skene&s;boroug, as more warlike;
but a very little time proved that, with equal depravity in general principle,
their only pre-eminence con&s;i&s;ted in ferocity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Har|rington from que&s;t. 6 to 23.</NOTE>The
hopes I had placed in their wild honour, and in the controul of their
conductors, which, as I &s;tated before, at fir&s;t had been promi&s;ing, were
&s;oon at an end; and their ill-humour and mutinous di&s;po&s;ition were
manife&s;t &s;oon after my arrival at Fort Edward. The apparent cau&s;es of
their change of temper were the re&s;entment I had &s;hewn upon the murder of
Mi&s;s Macrea, and the re&s;traints I had laid on their di&s;po&s;ition to
commit other enormities; but I never doubted that their evil pa&s;&s;ions were
fomented, and their defection completed by the cabals of the Canadian
interpreters. Rapacity, &s;elf-intere&s;t, and pre&s;umption are the
characteri&s;tics of the&s;e men, with &s;ome few exceptions. The acqui&s;ition
of the Indian language has u&s;ually been a certain fortune to a man with an
artful head and a convenient con&s;cience.</P>
<P>To check the old practices of peculation in the&s;e men, Sir Guy
Carleton, with great judgment, had given the &s;uperintendency of the Indian
department to Major Campbell and Captain Frazer, gentlemen of the highe&s;t
integrity. The Briti&s;h officers employed &s;olely in the military conduct of
that department, were al&s;o &s;elected with equal pro|priety. The interpreters
had from the fir&s;t regarded with a jealous eye a &s;y&s;tem which took out of
their hands the di&s;tribution of Indian nece&s;&s;aries and pre&s;ents; but
when they found the plunder of the country, as well as that of the government,
was controuled, the profligate policy of many was employed to promote
di&s;&s;ention, revolt, and de&s;ertion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Luc.</NOTE>I take this occa&s;ion to acquit
Mon&s;ieur St. Luc of any &s;u&s;picion of his being con|cerned in the&s;e
factions; but I believe he di&s;cerned them. He certainly knew that the Indians
pined after a renewal of their accu&s;tomed horrors; and that they were be|come
as impatient of his controul as of all other, though the pride and intere&s;t
of authority, and the affection he bore to his old a&s;&s;ociates, induced him
to cover the real cau&s;es under various frivolous pretences of di&s;content,
with which I was daily tor|mented, but to which I con&s;tantly attended: and
though I differed totally with Saint Luc in opinion upon the efficacy of
the&s;e allies, I invariably took his advice in the <PB N="100" REF="106">
management of them, even to an indulgence of their mo&s;t capricious fancies,
when they did not involve the di&s;honour of the King's &s;ervice and the
di&s;grace of huma|nity. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Har|rington's qu. la&s;t re|ferred
to.</NOTE>The council of the 4th of Augu&s;t was held at his pre&s;&s;ing
in&s;tance; and in that council, to my great a&s;toni&s;hment (for he had given
me no intimation of the de|&s;ign) the tribes with which he was mo&s;t
particularly connected, and for whom he in|terpreted, declared their intention
of returning home, and demanded my concurrence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The
embarra&s;&s;ment of this event was extreme. By acquie&s;cing, I voluntary
relinqui&s;hed part of my force that had been obtained with immen&s;e charge to
government, that had created high expectation at home and abroad, and that
in|deed my own army was by no means in condition to di&s;pen&s;e with;
becau&s;e, depend|ing upon the &s;uppo&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this much
over-valued race for &s;couts and out|po&s;ts, and all the le&s;&s;er, but
nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervices, for giving due repo&s;e to the camp, the Briti&s;h
light-infantry had been trained to higher purpo&s;es: they were de&s;tined to
lead in the general and deci&s;ive combats I expected in the woods, and could
not be &s;pared, or ri&s;ked, or harra&s;&s;ed, without palpable con&s;equences
of the mo&s;t di&s;agree|able kind.</P>
<P>On the contrary, I was convinced a cordial reconciliation with the
Indians was only to be effected by a renunciation of all my former prohibitions
and an indulgence in blood and rapine: I had not a friend in the department in
whom I could confide except Major Campbell, Captain Frazer, and the other
Briti&s;h officers: their ignorance of the languages, and the very probity of
their characters, rendered them of no weight in Indian councils. An an&s;wer,
neverthele&s;s, was to be made upon the moment; and the part I took was to give
a firm refu&s;al to their propo&s;ition, and to adhere to the controuls I had
before e&s;tabli&s;hed; but, with a temperate repre&s;entation of the ties of
faith, of genero&s;ity, and honour, to join every other argument con&s;i&s;tent
with tho&s;e principles which I could devi&s;e, to per&s;uade and encourage
them to continue their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>This &s;peech appeared to have the de&s;ired effect. The tribes
neare&s;t home affected to &s;eparate from the others, and only pre&s;&s;ed for
permi&s;&s;ion to return in parties to gather in their harve&s;t, propo&s;ing
to relieve each other; which was granted. Some of the remote tribes al&s;o
&s;eemed to retract their propo&s;itions, and profe&s;&s;ed a zeal for the
&s;ervice; but the de&s;ertion took place the next day by &s;cores, loaded with
&s;uch plunder as they had collected; and it continued from day to day, till
&s;carce a man that had joined at Skene&s;borough remained. This whole
tran&s;action, I aver, was before the plan of Bennington was formed.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">German troops.</NOTE>But to proceed to the
&s;urvey of other difficulties of the time. Great attention was due to the
management of the German troops.</P>
<P>The mode of war in which they were engaged was entirely new to them;
tempta|tions to de&s;ert were in them&s;elves great, and had been enhanced and
circulated among them by emi&s;&s;aries of the enemy with much art and
indu&s;try. Jealou&s;y of predilection in the allotment of po&s;ts and
&s;eparate commands ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among troops of different &s;tates; and
a &s;olid preference of judgment in the commander in chief often appears a
narrow national partiality.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of M. G. Reide|&s;el.</NOTE>I confe&s;s
I was much a&s;&s;i&s;ted in maintaining cordiality in an army thus compo&s;ed,
by the frank, &s;pirited, and honourable character I had to deal with in Major
General Reide&s;el;&mdash;a character which was very early impre&s;&s;ed upon
my mind, and which no trials of intricacy, danger, and di&s;tre&s;s, has
&s;ince effaced; but addre&s;s was &s;till requi&s;ite to &s;econd his zeal,
and to diffu&s;e it through the German ranks; and I &s;tudied to throw them
into &s;ituations that might give them confidence in them|&s;elves, credit with
their prince, and alacrity in the pur&s;uit of an enterpri&s;e, which, when its
difficulties were con&s;idered, in fact required enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Other parts of the alliance, though not liable to &s;u&s;picion of
treachery, like the Indians, nor of con&s;equence to be &s;o much attended to
as the Germans, neverthe|le&s;s had their perplexities. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cana|dian troops.</NOTE>The Canadians, were
officered by gentlemen of great <PB N="102" REF="108"> condition in their
country, but were not to be depended upon. In&s;tead of the enter|pri&s;ing and
daring &s;pirit which di&s;tingui&s;hed the character of that people under the
French government, was &s;ub&s;tituted a longing after home, the effect of
di&s;u&s;e of arms and long habits of dome&s;tic enjoyments; and this
di&s;ea&s;e <HI>(mal de payz)</HI> is carried in them to a greater proverbial
extreme than in any other people to whom the term is more commonly applied.</P>
<P>It was neither ea&s;y to keep the&s;e people together, nor to
&s;upport the ideas of re|&s;pect which the enemy entertained of them from the
remembrance of the former war. The only manner of effecting the latter
purpo&s;e was to &s;hew them occa&s;ionally at a di&s;tance, but rarely to
commit them upon parties where they were likely to fall in with the be&s;t
cla&s;&s;es of the Rangers oppo&s;ed to us: perhaps there are few better in the
world than the corps of Virginia Riflemen, which acted under Colonel
Morgan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Provincial corps.</NOTE>The Provincial Corps, of
which I had two in embryo, and &s;everal detached par|ties, were yet a heavier
tax upon time and patience. They were compo&s;ed of pro|fe&s;&s;ed Loyali&s;ts,
many of whom had taken refuge in Canada the preceding winter, and others had
joined as we advanced. The various intere&s;ts which influenced their actions
rendered all arrangement of them impracticable. One man's views went to the
profit which he was to enjoy when his corps &s;hould be complete; another's, to
the protection of the di&s;trict in which he re&s;ided; a third was wholly
intent upon revenge again&s;t his per&s;onal enemies; and all of them were
repugnant even to an idea of &s;ubordination. Hence the &s;ettlement who
&s;hould act as a private man, and who as an officer, or in who&s;e corps
either &s;hould be, was &s;eldom &s;atisfactorily made among them&s;elves; and
as &s;urely as it failed, &s;ucceeded a reference to the Com|mander in Chief,
which could not be put by, or delegated to another hand, with|out
di&s;&s;atisfaction, encrea&s;e of confu&s;ion, and generally a lo&s;s of
&s;uch &s;ervices as they were really fit for, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;earching for
cattle, a&s;certaining the practicability of routes, clearing roads, and
guiding detachments or columns upon the march.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would
not be under&s;tood to infer, that none of the Provincials with me were
&s;incere in their loyalty; perhaps many were &s;o. A few were of
di&s;tingui&s;hed bravery, among which it would be unju&s;t not to
particularize Mr. Fi&s;tar, who fell at Bennington, and Capt. Sherwood, who was
forward in every &s;ervice of danger to the end of the campaign. I only
maintain that the intere&s;ts and the pa&s;&s;ions of the revolted Americans
concenter in the cau&s;e of the Congre&s;s; and tho&s;e of the Loyali&s;ts
break and &s;ubdivide into various pur&s;uits, with which the cau&s;e of the

&s;eems of mo&s;t importance, viz. the extent of the march, as de&s;cribed in

<P>The whole of the letter, from which the above is an extract, is
curious, and may be &s;een in the Parliamentary Regi&s;ter, No.

<P>This I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t is an unan&s;werable defence, with
re&s;pect to the noble Lord, and tho&s;e who think with him; for it is &s;trict
and po&s;itive coincidence with their opi|nions, pa&s;t and pre&s;ent&mdash;and
if I &s;aid it will be &s;o with tho&s;e to come, my prophecy would be
authorized by the conviction and triumph which Mr. Galway's evidence,
re&s;pecting the loyalty of the Americans, &s;eemed to produce in the parties
to whom I allude.</P>
<P>But in due re&s;pect to other judges, it is incumbent upon me to
&s;tate a more &s;e|rious defence.</P>
<P>As Lieutenant Colonel King&s;ton cannot prove juridically that the
rough draft of the de&s;ign which ended the affair of Bennington was the &s;ame
which was deliver|ed by General Reide&s;el, and I am unwilling upon memory to
incur a po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;take, even in an immaterial circum&s;tance that
re&s;pects an ab&s;ent friend, I am content it &s;hould be con&s;idered as an
uncertaintainty, and I drop all u&s;e that could be drawn from the original
compo&s;ition. It will fully an&s;wer my purpo&s;e to adhere to the bare
a&s;&s;ertion which I am &s;ure will never be contradicted, that Major Gene|ral
Reide&s;el originally conceived an expedition for the purpo&s;e of mounting his
dragoons, and &s;upplying the troops in general with baggage-hor&s;es; that I
thought his idea might be extended to much greater u&s;e, and that the plan was
con&s;idered, amended, and enlarged, in concert with him. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lieut. Col. King&s;ton's que&s;t.</NOTE>Therefore
upon the ab&s;tract ground and rea&s;on of the mea&s;ure, I might urge, that it
was &s;upported by naked military principle, according to the &s;entiments of a
general of great natural talents, and long &s;ervice under the fir&s;t
ma&s;ters of the age. It is proved, that the &s;ame &s;en|timents were ratified
by the full approbation of Major General Phillips, an officer of &s;imilar
de&s;cription, to whom the plan was communicated; and if a &s;ingle part of the
&s;ame plan, mentioned to be at fir&s;t di&s;approved by Brigadier General
Frazer, continued to be &s;o after explanation, that di&s;approbation did not
appear. In|deed the utmo&s;t that can be drawn from the evidence of Lieutenant
Colonel <PB N="105" REF="111"> King&s;ton, or any other witne&s;s, amounts to
no more than an implied wi&s;h in the Brigadier to have conducted the
expedition at the head of his di&s;tinct corps. It was the fact. Devoted to
glory and prodigal of life; earne&s;t for the general &s;ucce&s;s of the
campaign, and particularly anxious for every plan adopted by the man he loved,
he grudged a danger or care in other hands than his own. It was not envy or
di&s;|paragement of the German troops, but zeal and impatience for employment,
that influenced his predilection for the Briti&s;h. I honoured the principle,
while I re|&s;trained it; and I re&s;erved his ardour and judgment for a
&s;econd movement, which required tho&s;e qualities much more than the
expedition to Bennington did, according to any intelligence or appearance of
things at the time. It will be ob|&s;erved from the evidence, that the whole of
Brigadier Fra&s;er's corps was thrown over the river, and actually po&s;ted at
the opening of the plain near Saratoga, when Col. Baume marched; and the
de&s;ign was, upon the fir&s;t news of Baume's &s;ucce&s;s, to have pu&s;hed
that corps to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights near Stillwater, and to
have intrenched there, till the army and the provi&s;ion could have joined, by
which means the whole country on the we&s;t &s;ide the river, to the banks of
the Mohawk, would have been our own.</P>
<P>But moreover it is to be ob&s;erved, that Major General Reide&s;el
was far from being ignorant, as has been &s;ugge&s;ted, of the nature of the
country, or the profe&s;&s;ions of the inhabitants. He was ju&s;t returned from
commanding a detached corps at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the main army,
in the very heart of the country from which the enemy's force at Bennington was
afterwards &s;upplied. He &s;poke the Engli&s;h language well; he was
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by many natives of the be&s;t information.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the brave but deceived officer who commanded the
detach|ment, was induced to deviate from the cautions pre&s;cribed in the
in&s;tructions. A plan drawn by an engineer upon the &s;pot is added to the
evidence produced to the committee, to &s;hew more clearly where that deviation
happened. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Har|rington's q. 28 to 31.</NOTE>It appears
al&s;o in proof, that the mea&s;ures taken to relieve Colonel Baume, upon the
news of his difficulty, were the mo&s;t &s;peedy that could be u&s;ed, and
would have been time|ly, had not Colonel Brieman's march been more tardy than
could have been &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ible. I take the fact as &s;tated in his
own account, without impeaching his cre|dit with regard to the ob&s;tacles he
de&s;cribes. But as a farther vindication of the intelligence and principle
upon which the original &s;trength of the detachment was framed, and the mere
accident which made even error po&s;&s;ible, I reque&s;t admi&s;|&s;ion for the
proof of a new fact which I did not know it was in my power to bring, till
after Captain Money had left the bar of the Hou&s;e of Commons; and as I was
precluded from calling him a &s;econd time, by the abrupt clo&s;e of the
proceedings, I had no other way of laying it before the public, than by
&s;tating the que&s;tion in <PB N="106" REF="112"> writing, and requiring his
authority to publi&s;h the an&s;wer, which I obtained, and they are as
follows:</P>
<P>Q. Do you know any circum&s;tance re&s;pecting an unexpected
reinforcement re|ceived by the rebels at Bennington near the time of the
action?</P>
<P>A. 
<Q REND="inline">"A few days after I was pri&s;oner in the rebel
camp, &s;ome of their officers told me, that it was a providential
circum&s;tance, that General Starks was coming through Bennington with 1200
militia of the New-Hamp&s;hire Grants, to join their main army near Albany, for
the guard on the provi&s;ion at Bennington did not amount to more than 400 men;
and that on his hearing of a detachment of our army being only four or five
miles from him, he with the guard, and what militia could be collected in the
neighbourhood, attacked and defeated the de|tachment, as well as the
reinforcement that were on their march to join them. The rebel officers al&s;o
informed me, and I have &s;een accounts that agree with what I then heard, that
during the action General Starks was 'luckily' joined by Colonel Warner with a
con&s;iderable body of men. I have frequently heard our officers &s;ay that
were in this action, that had Colonel Baume retreated four miles, and
recro&s;&s;ed the river he pa&s;&s;ed the day before, and taken po&s;t there,
when he found by information he could not proceed, and had wrote for a
rein|forcement, he would have met Colonel Breiman coming to his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and would not have ri&s;qued the lo&s;s of his corps, which
by his in&s;tructions were &s;o &s;trongly recommended, as not even to ri&s;que
a con&s;iderable lo&s;s. This, Sir, is as nearly as po&s;&s;ible the an&s;wer I
&s;hould have given had the que&s;tion been a&s;ked me in the Hou&s;e of
Commons.&mdash;J. Money."</Q></P>
<P>This piece of evidence will &s;erve to &s;hew that it was not the
&s;ucce&s;s of the rebels at Bennington that animated the militia to
a&s;&s;emble, and march in the cau&s;e of the Congre&s;s; and he mu&s;t be of
&s;teady faith indeed in American loyalty who can &s;uppo&s;e much of it really
exi&s;ted in the country of the Hamp&s;hire Grants (how&s;oever it had been
affected and profe&s;&s;ed) when he reflects, not only that General Starks and
Colonel Warner were not oppo&s;ed in collecting their men, though my army, then
in a tide of &s;ucce&s;s, were near at hand; but al&s;o that not a loyali&s;t
was found earne&s;t enough to convey me intelligence.</P>
<P>It will likewi&s;e appear, from this piece of evidence, when
compared with the map of the country and the di&s;po&s;ition of the troops,
that had not the accidental pa&s;&s;age of the detachments under Starks and
Warner been exceedingly critical, it could not have availed.&mdash;Forty-eight
hours &s;ooner, they would have joined General Gates; and he would hardly have
detached them, or any other part of his force, back to Benning|ton, even though
he had heard of a movement to my left; becau&s;e he mu&s;t have known that the
whole of Fra&s;er's corps lay ready to march rapidly upon him from my 
<PB N="107" REF="113"> right.&mdash;Forty-eight hours later, the blow would
have been &s;truck; and the &s;tores, con&s;i&s;ting of live cattle, and
flower, with abundant carriages to convey it, would have been out of reach.</P>
<P>Another reflection will be apt to ari&s;e in &s;peculative minds
upon this &s;ubject, viz. on what nice chances depends the reputation of an
officer who acts under &s;el|fi&s;h and ungenerous employers! Such men not only
with-hold the fair protection that would ari&s;e from an explanation of his
motives, but are the fir&s;t to join the cry of the uninformed multitude, who
always judge by events. Thus every plan receives a colouring in the extreme;
and is denominated (often with equal inju&s;tice) a fatal error or a brilliant
enterprize.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro&s;s-exa|mination of Lord Har|rington, q.
89.</NOTE>But it &s;till may be &s;aid, the expedition was not originally
de&s;igned again&s;t Ben|nington. I really do not &s;ee to what it could tend
again&s;t me, if that &s;uppo&s;ition were in a great degree admitted. That
&s;ome part of the force was de&s;igned to act there, will not be di&s;puted by
any who read Colonel Baume's in&s;tructions, and con|&s;ult the map. The blame
or merit of the de&s;ign altogether, mu&s;t re&s;t upon the mo|tives of
expediency; and it is of little con&s;equence whether the fir&s;t and principal
di|rection was again&s;t Bennington, or Arlington, or any other di&s;trict, as
my intelligence might have varied re&s;pecting the depo&s;its of corn and
cattle of the enemy. At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t ob&s;erve it is begging the
que&s;tion, to argue that Bennington was not the real, original object,
becau&s;e Bennington was not mentioned in the draft of in|&s;tructions. A man
mu&s;t indeed be void of military and political addre&s;s, to put upon paper a
critical de&s;ign, where &s;urprize was in que&s;tion, and every thing depended
upon &s;ecre&s;y. Though it were true, that I meant only Bennington, and
thought of nothing le&s;s than the progre&s;s of the expedition, in the extent
of the order, I certainly would not now affirm it, becau&s;e I could not prove
it; and becau&s;e it would &s;eem, that I &s;earched for remote and ob&s;cure
ju&s;tification, not re|lying upon that which was manife&s;t; but &s;urely
there is nothing new or improbable in the idea, that a general &s;hould
di&s;gui&s;e his real intentions at the out&s;et of an expedi|tion, even from
the officer whom he appointed to execute them, provided a commu|nication with
that officer was certain and not remote.</P>
<P>This review of the affair of Bennington, tho' long, I tru&s;t will
not be deemed mi&s;|placed; and from the different parts of it, I think, will
clearly be e&s;tabli&s;hed the few following a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>1&s;t. That the de&s;ign upon Bennington was ju&s;tified by the
circum&s;tances of the time.</P>
<P>2d. That there was no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the force of the enemy
there greater than what the detachment was adequate to defeat.</P>
<P>3d. That when the force was di&s;covered to be greater, the ill
con&s;equences would have been avoided had not Colonel Baume deviated from his
in&s;tructions, by commit|ting <PB N="108" REF="114"> his regular force in the
woods in&s;tead of fortifying a po&s;t in the open country, and exploring the
woods only with the Indians, Canadians, and Provincials, &s;upported by Captain
Fra&s;er's corps, who were complete ma&s;ters of &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>4th. That after Colonel Baume had committed that error, it would
have been re|trieved had Colonel Brieman's reinforcement accompli&s;hed their
march in the time they ought to have done.</P>
<P>5th. That the &s;trength of the enemy was merely accidental.</P>
<P>And, as a final ob&s;ervation, I will add, that when a mini&s;ter
&s;tates a common acci|dent of war, independent of any general action,
unattended with any lo&s;s that could affect the main &s;trength of the army,
and little more than the mi&s;carriage of a forag|ing party, to have been fatal
to a whole campaign, of which he had directed the pro|gre&s;s and apportioned
the force, he makes but an ill compliment to his own judgment.</P>

&s;ubject with &s;crupulous exactne&s;s. With &s;uch it is my duty, as a
per|&s;on on my defence, to enter into detail, and I will lay my ground in the
que&s;tion put to Captain Money in his cro&s;s-examination and his
an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Q. Why did the Army remain from the 16th of Augu&s;t to the 13th of
September 
<Q REND="inline">"before they cro&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on's-River to
engage the Rebels at Stillwater?"</Q></P>
<P>A. 
<Q REND="inline">"To bring forward a &s;ufficient quantity of
provi&s;ions and artillery, to enable the General to give up his
communication."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Capt. Mo|ney, q. 20; and for the general ac|count
of the efforts u&s;ed &s;ee the &s;ame evidence from q. 12 to 25.</NOTE>With
all the powers of conveyance po&s;&s;ible to be mu&s;tered, Captain Money
computes, (and his computation tallies nearly with the table formed by the
Commi&s;&s;ary-General) that five days provi&s;ion, viz. four for forming the
magazine and one for daily con&s;ump|tion, was the mo&s;t that could be
conveyed at once.</P>
<P>To bring this to an average I will a&s;&s;ume only two days for
accidents of weather, roads, fatigue of cattle, breaking of carriages, and
other common di&s;appointments: this is much le&s;s time than according to the
evidence might be allowed, and upon This computation it would take ten days to
convey the magazine to Fort Edward only. <PB N="109" REF="115"> The &s;tage
from thence to the encampment and intended depo&s;itary mu&s;t not be computed
by di&s;tance but by impediments. The rapids of the river and the different
carrying|places have been de&s;cribed by the witne&s;&s;es, and it re&s;ults
that this &s;tage was much longer in point of time than the former one. It was
not po&s;&s;ible to keep the tran&s;ports going at both &s;tages together for
the ten days mentioned, becau&s;e there were not boats in the river
&s;ufficient for more than the daily &s;upply; nor could they have been
conveyed there in that time by any po&s;&s;ible means, for the&s;e rea&s;ons;
the boat carriages, which were of a con&s;truction &s;imilar to timber
carriages u&s;ed in England, were only twelve in number, and each carriage
employed &s;ix hor&s;es or four oxen to draw it; and could any other means of
draft for boats over land have been contrived, or cattle have been &s;upplied
from the artillery, or any other department, all would have been u&s;ele&s;s;
be|cau&s;e the boats them&s;elves, to a greater amount than tho&s;e above
&s;pecified, were wanting till after the whole of the provi&s;ion tran&s;port
between Ticonderoga and Fort George, upon which they were employed, was
fini&s;hed, and it had barely kept pace &s;o as to &s;upply the land
tran&s;port between Fort George and Fort Edward.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire only an allowance of fifteen days for the carriage over
the &s;econd &s;tage, and it will thus take, in the whole, twenty-five days to
form the magazine alone.</P>
<P>I claim no additional allowance of time for conveying one hundred
boats, at lea&s;t, through the difficulties of land and water, in the two
&s;tages, but compri&s;e that labour among the re&s;t of the la&s;t fifteen
days. It mu&s;t be neverthele&s;s ob&s;erved, that even this number was &s;hort
of what was wanting, and, to &s;ave time, all the artificers were employed in
building &s;couls (fourteen of which were fini&s;hed during the tran&s;|port)
to make water craft, in the whole &s;ufficient to carry the magazine forward,
after the communication &s;hould be at an end. The new caulking the boats,
though indi&s;pen|&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to great part of them, after
pa&s;&s;ing the lakes loaded, and afterwards being &s;haken and damaged by land
carriage, is another work which I throw into the la&s;t fifteen days of the
tran&s;port, or into the &s;ub&s;equent four days, which mu&s;t at the lea&s;t
be allotted for loading the magazine, and arranging the order of its proceeding
both in re&s;pect to navigation and defence. This was committed to very expert
naval officers, and was matter of no trivial concern, or ea&s;y execution.</P>
<P>The whole bu&s;ine&s;s, according to the above repre&s;entation and
calculation, both which are founded upon evidence, would have taken twenty-nine
days: twenty-&s;even only were employed, viz. from Augu&s;t the 16th to
September the 13th. The exertions in fact, outwent the calculation; and I
challenge the mo&s;t minute &s;pecula|ti&s;ts, to try the time and the powers
we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by every po&s;&s;ible di&s;tribution of carriages and
cattle, different from that which was practi&s;ed, and I will venture to &s;ay
none will be found le&s;s dilatory.</P>
<P>It appears clearly in proof, that no impediment to this tran&s;port
was occa&s;ioned by the interference of the artillery; but it has been implied
by &s;ome que&s;tions in the cro&s;s <PB N="110" REF="116"> examinations, that
if the artillery did not interfere with the tran&s;port, the tran&s;port ought
to have interfered with the artillery, and that by appropriating their hor&s;es
to the provi&s;ion train, much time might have been &s;aved.</P>
<P>It might be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer, that the artillery, for the
rea&s;ons I have before a&s;&s;igned was not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and
con&s;equently the hor&s;es were to be pre&s;erved: but I be&s;ides have
&s;hewn, that they could not have been of u&s;e to the tran&s;port of the
boats; and to &s;atisfy every &s;cruple, and to &s;hew how mi&s;taken they are
who &s;uppo&s;e an advantage was to be obtained by the employment of artillery
hor&s;es to convey pro|vi&s;ions, I now offer to their reflection the
additional fact, that they could have been of no avail, becau&s;e we had
neither carts nor pack-&s;addles, more than were in u&s;e already.</P>

<P>Having thus &s;hewn that the tran&s;port of provi&s;ion and other
&s;tores, for about thirty days, was effected in the &s;horte&s;t time
po&s;&s;ible, it now becomes nece&s;&s;ary to examine <PB N="111" REF="117"> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Que&s;tion made, whe|ther the army might not have
proceed|ed to Albany without &s;tores? Idea of a rapid march.</NOTE>the
que&s;tion, which has been very much canva&s;&s;ed in print, and by the cro&s;s
exami|nation, appears to have made impre&s;&s;ion upon &s;ome gentlemen;
whether this prepara|tion might not have been di&s;pen&s;ed with, and the army
have reached Albany by a ra|pid march, the &s;oldiers carrying upon their backs
a &s;ufficiency of provi&s;ion to &s;upport them during the time.</P>
<P>It is very natural for men of all de&s;criptions, to apply the idea
of a rapid march to a di&s;tance of fifty miles, for it is not more mea&s;uring
in a &s;treight line from Fort Ed|ward to Albany, and it will be proper to
con&s;ider the principle and practibility of &s;uch march, with re&s;pect to
two di&s;tinct periods, the one before, the other after the at|tempt upon
Bennington.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, it will be remembered, that in the
&s;tate the roads then were, and with the re&s;ources then to be employed, no
provi&s;ion before-hand was attainable. Therefore, to have brought the plan of
a rapid advance within the compa&s;s of a po&s;&s;ibility, the operation mu&s;t
have begun by marching the whole rapidly backward, in order to load the men
with their packs of provi&s;ions. How the troops, zealous as they were, would
have reli&s;hed a &s;tep &s;o uncommon in its nature, and productive of &s;o
much unexpected fatigue, particularly how the Ger|mans would have been &s;o
per&s;uaded of the nece&s;&s;ity as to have undertaken it with good will,
cannot be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>But the&s;e doubts apart, it remains to be con&s;idered, how the
troops were to pa&s;s two very large rivers, the Hud&s;on and the Mohawk,
without previous provi&s;ion for a bridge, or water-craft for conveying large
bodies at once. Every conce&s;&s;ion a &s;anguine projector can de&s;ire
&s;hall be made upon this point al&s;o; the contrivance of rafts, bound
together by twigs and &s;trips of bark, as in fact was practi&s;ed at this very
period for the pa&s;&s;age of Fra&s;er's corps over Hud&s;on's River, &s;hall
be admitted equally practicable for the whole army; and in argument be it
tru&s;ted to chance to pa&s;s the Mohawk in the &s;ame way; or &s;hould it
fail, let recour&s;e be had to the ford, which is known to be practicable,
<HI>except after heavy rains,</HI> near Schenectady, about fifteen miles from
the mouth of the river.</P>
<P>The&s;e conce&s;&s;ions granted, we will &s;uppo&s;e the army on the
bank of the Hud&s;on's River, where they afterwards pa&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The idea of a rapid march will of cour&s;e be exempt from all
thought of per&s;onal incumbrances (provi&s;ion exempted) and the &s;oldier
will &s;tand repre&s;ented in the imagination, trim and nimble as he is &s;een
at an exerci&s;e in an Engli&s;h encamp|ment&mdash;Indeed <PB N="112" REF="118"> it is nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be con&s;idered in that form; for
nothing can be more repugnant to a project of rapidity, than the &s;oldier's
load, were he to carry all the articles belonging to him in a campaign.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They con&s;i&s;t of a knap&s;ack, containing his bodily
nece&s;&s;aries, a blanket, a haver&s;ack with provi&s;ions, a carteen, a
hatchet, and a fifth &s;hare of the general camp equipage belonging to his
tent. The&s;e arti|cles (reckoning the provi&s;ion to be for four days) added
to his accountrements, arms, and &s;ixty rounds of ammunition, make a bulk
totally incompatible with combat, and a weight of about &s;ixty
pounds.</NOTE></P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, and with truth, that troops are u&s;ually
relieved from a con|&s;iderable part of this burthen, and many examples of this
relief may be brought from the general cu&s;tom of &s;ervice, and from many
movements of General Howe's army in particular&mdash;nay more, it was a
frequent practice of the very army in que&s;|tion, to march free from
knap&s;acks and camp equipage. The Wigwam, or hut con&s;tructed of boughs, may
be made a very whole&s;ome &s;ub&s;titute for a tent; and when victual can be
cooked before-hand, even the camp kettle for an expeditious march may be laid
a&s;ide. All the&s;e examples are admitted: but they all imply conveniencies
for the &s;everal articles to follow, and to be brought up in due time. In our
ca&s;e they mu&s;t have been lo&s;t irrecoverably.</P>
<P>Will it be argued, that &s;ome medium might have been devi&s;ed? And
although it were impo&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tently with the idea of rapidity, to
carry forward more provi&s;ion than for bare &s;u&s;tenance during the march,
yet carts might have been found &s;ufficient to carry the men's knap&s;acks,
and camp kettles, and other indi&s;pen|&s;ible articles? This &s;uppo&s;ition
would betray a great ignorance of the country. From Saratoga to Albany there is
only one road practicable for wheel carriage. There are many places where by
de&s;troying the bridges over deep gullies which di&s;|charge them&s;elves into
the main river, a pa&s;&s;age would be rendered impo&s;&s;ible, not only for a
wheel carriage, but a hor&s;e. There are others where the road is bounded by
the river on one &s;ide, and by almo&s;t perpendicular a&s;cents covered with
wood on the other. Here the very &s;hort work of felling a few trees would
&s;top all pa&s;&s;age. The expence of time to remove the&s;e ob&s;tructions,
or to make new roads, would have brought famine. All notion, therefore, of
conveying any articles more than could be carried upon men's &s;houlders mu&s;t
cea&s;e. The notion of artillery, even the &s;mal|le&s;t pieces, mu&s;t al&s;o
cea&s;e of cour&s;e, not even a little ammunition-tumbril could have found its
way.&mdash;An ea&s;y &s;acrifice to the theori&s;ts, who have maintained the
inutility of artillery: but any officer who has &s;een the ground of this
&s;uppo&s;ed march, would point out a dozen pa&s;&s;es, not to &s;peak of the
pa&s;&s;age of the Mohawk, where, &s;trengthened with abattis and &s;uch other
works as the rebels are expert in making in a very few hours, five hundred
militia would &s;top for a time, ten times their number of the be&s;t troops in
the world who had not artillery to a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="119"> Having &s;tated the&s;e objections to the
principle of a rapid march, let us now, from the knowledge that has been
&s;ince obtained of circum&s;tances, con&s;ider what would have been the
certain con&s;equences of the attempt.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are acquainted with the capricious workings of the
tempers of men, will not wonder at the difficulty of prevailing upon a common
&s;oldier in any exi|gency to hu&s;band his provi&s;ions. In a &s;ettled camp,
the young &s;oldier has very &s;hort fare on the fourth day after delivery: but
upon a march in bad weather and bad roads, when the weary foot &s;lips back at
every &s;tep, and a general cur&s;e is provoked at the weight that cau&s;es the
retardment, he mu&s;t be a patient veteran, and of much experience in
&s;carcity, who is not tempted to throw the whole con|tents of the haver&s;ack
into the mire. He feels the pre&s;ent incumbrance grievous&mdash;Want is a day
remote.&mdash; 
<Q REND="inline">"Let the General find a &s;upply: it is the King's
cau&s;e and the General's intere&s;t&mdash;he will never let the &s;oldier be
&s;tarved."</Q></P>
<P>This is common rea&s;oning in the ranks. I &s;tate it for tho&s;e
who have not &s;een fatiguing &s;ervice, and may have a judgment to form upon
it. It need not be ap|plied to the pre&s;ent con&s;ideration; for had the march
taken place at the time it ought to have done, upon the principle of the
defenders of that &s;cheme, the time that Fra&s;er's corps fir&s;t pa&s;t the
river upon the bridge of rafts, wa&s;te would only have con&s;pired to
accompli&s;h in <HI>three days</HI> a ruin that with the be&s;t hu&s;bandry
would have been inevitable in <HI>&s;ix:</HI> for the &s;ame fall of rain which
it has been &s;hewn in evidence actually carried away the bridge a very few
days after it was con&s;tructed, nece&s;&s;arily made the ford of the Mohawk
for an advance, and every ford of the Hud&s;on's River for a return,
impa&s;&s;able. It hardly need be noticed, that a flood mu&s;t have made any
u&s;e of rafts, could they have been timely obtained, equally impracticable.
The army, therefore, would have become victims to famine, without a blow, or a
&s;ingle effort of the enemy. Saratoga mu&s;t have been the anticipated &s;cene
of &s;urrender, without other conditions than the mercy of &s;u&s;tenance; the
whole force of Mr. Gates would have been loo&s;e to co-operate with Mr.
Wa&s;hington, with the fine&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the campaign before them; and the
General of the northern army, with|out a &s;hadow of profe&s;&s;ional defence,
and precluded from the plea u&s;ually &s;o per|&s;ua&s;ive, that he fought hard
before he failed, mu&s;t have met the cen&s;ure of his So|vereign and a
ju&s;tly offended country, with none to &s;upport him but the pre&s;ent
advocates of a rapid march. Could his dependence have been &s;ure even upon
them? Would they not rather have adhered to their oppo&s;ite and original
&s;y&s;tem (for &s;trange as it is, the &s;ame men have &s;upported both) and
have a&s;&s;erted, that it was extreme ra&s;hne&s;s to cro&s;s the Hud&s;on's
River at all?</P>
<P>If what I have &s;aid in objection to the principle and
practicability of a rapid march to Albany, previous to the attempt upon
Bennington, has weight, very little need be added on the &s;ubject afterwards,
becau&s;e every objection will multiply up|on <PB N="114" REF="120"> the mind
of the mo&s;t cur&s;ory ob&s;erver. I &s;hall only call the attention to a very
few e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tances. The enemy was in force; a proof of his being
&s;o is, that Mr. Gates quitted his po&s;ition behind the Mohawk, which was his
&s;tronge&s;t, and advanced to Stillwater. The force found at Bennington upon
the march from the Hamp&s;hire Grants to the main army, proved the vigour and
ala|crity of the enemy in that country. The circum&s;tances of the action at
Benning|ton e&s;tabli&s;hed a yet more melancholy conviction of the fallacy of
any dependence upon &s;uppo&s;ed friends. The noble Lord has &s;aid, that 
<Q REND="inline">"I never de&s;paired of the campaign before the
affair of Bennington; that I had no doubt of gaining Albany in as &s;hort a
time as the army (in due condition of &s;upply) could accompli&s;h the
march."</Q> I acknowledge the truth of the a&s;&s;ertions in their fulle&s;t
extent; all my letters at the time &s;hew it. I will go further, and in one
&s;en&s;e apply with the noble Lord the epithet "fatal" to the affair of
Bennington. The knowledge I acquired of the profe&s;&s;ors of loyalty was
"fatal," and put an end to every expectation from enterprize un&s;u&s;tained by
dint of force. It would have been exce&s;s of fren|zy to have tru&s;ted for
&s;u&s;tenance to the plentiful region of Albany. Had the march thither been
practicable in all re&s;pects, and even unoppo&s;ed, (which nobody will think
would have been the ca&s;e) the enemy finding the Briti&s;h army un&s;upplied,
would only have had to compel the Tories to drive the cattle and de&s;troy the
corn or the corn mills, and the convention of Albany in&s;tead of Saratoga
mu&s;t have fol|lowed. Would the Tories have ri&s;en? Why did they not ri&s;e
round Albany and below it, at the time they found Mr. Gates's army increa&s;ing
by &s;eparate and di|&s;tinct parties from remote di&s;tances? They were better
qualified by their &s;ituation to catch the favourable moment than I was to
advi&s;e it. Why did they not ri&s;e in that populous and as &s;uppo&s;ed well
affected di&s;trict, the German Flats, at the time St. Leger was before Fort
Stanwix? A critical in&s;urrection from any one point of the compa&s;s within
di&s;tance to create diver&s;ion, would probably have &s;ecured the &s;ucce&s;s
of the campaign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. St. Le|ger's letter. No. V.</NOTE>But to
revert to the encrea&s;e of rea&s;ons again&s;t a rapid march after the affair
of Bennington. It was then al&s;o known, that by the fal&s;e intelligence
re&s;pecting the &s;trength of Fort Stanwix, the infamous behaviour of the
Indians, and the want of the promi&s;ed co-operation of the loyal inhabitants,
Lieut. Col. St. Leger had been obliged to retreat. The fir&s;t plau&s;ible
motive in favour of hazardous ha&s;te, the fa|cilitating his de&s;cent of the
Mohawk, was thus at an end. The pro&s;pect of finding the enemy di&s;per&s;ed
it has before been &s;hewn was over.</P>
<P>The impo&s;&s;ibility of pre&s;erving a communication was al&s;o
evident. Was the ar|my to have proceeded to action without ho&s;pital &s;tores,
as well as without victual? The general who carries troops into fire without
precautions to alleviate the certain con&s;equences, takes a &s;ure &s;tep to
alienate the affections, and de&s;troy the ardour of <PB N="115" REF="121"> the
&s;oldier&mdash;he exacts more than human &s;pirit can furni&s;h. Men need not
be ha|bituated to fields of battle to be convinced of this truth. Let the mind
re&s;t for a moment on the objects which will ri&s;e within it after the
mention of action, and then reflect, there is not a mattra&s;s for broken
bones, nor a cordial for agony and faint|ne&s;s. They who talk of the&s;e rapid
marches, &s;uppo&s;e no oppo&s;ition, or no &s;uffering in con&s;equence of
oppo&s;ition. The hundreds of wounded men to be cruelly aban|doned (if the
re&s;t could be prevailed upon to abandon tho&s;e who&s;e ca&s;e might the next
day be their own) make no part of the con&s;ideration of the&s;e gentlemen of
precipitate imaginations. But officers who are re&s;pon&s;ible to God and their
coun|try for the armies they conduct, cannot &s;o ea&s;ily overlook &s;uch
objects; and mu&s;t be patient at lea&s;t till a few hundred beds, and a proper
proportion of medicine and chirurgical materials, can be brought up for troops
that are to fight as well as to march.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of rapid movement has run into much length: the
&s;tre&s;s laid upon it in the cro&s;s-examination, was the cau&s;e. I beg
leave very &s;hortly to reca|pitulate the principal points, and &s;hall then
di&s;mi&s;s it to the public judgment, with|out great apprehen&s;ion of having
it renewed even in &s;peculation.</P>
<P>Had a proper &s;tore of live cattle been obtained by the expedition
to Bennington, (and by the bye it will be remembered, that had the loyali&s;ts
of the country been really of the number and de&s;cription repre&s;ented, that
acqui&s;ition might have been made without an action) all the carriages might
have been appropriated &s;olely to the conveyance of flour, ho&s;pital
accommodations, entrenching tools, and other ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;aries; and a
rapid march to Albany might have been hazarded.</P>
<P>After the expedition to Bennington had failed of that great
purpo&s;e, had a gar|ri&s;on for Ticonderoga been attainable from Canada, and
the force then at Ticon|deroga been brought forward, to e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;t
of communication, and &s;ecure a pa&s;&s;age of the river by a fortified
bridge, and redoubts upon the heights which every where command the river, on
one &s;hore or the other, a forced march might &s;till have been ju&s;tifiable,
becau&s;e a retreat was &s;ecure: but, dive&s;ted of both the&s;e re&s;ources,
a rapid movement mu&s;t inevitably have led to rapid ruin.</P>
<P>Having gone through all the material points previous to the 13th of
September, and &s;hewn, I tru&s;t, by di&s;tinct evidence, as well as
rea&s;oning, the expediency of the march from Skene&s;borough to Fort Edward;
the principle of the expedition to Bennington; the cau&s;e of its failure; the

even inde|pendently of the peremptory tenor of my orders, which, confident in
the &s;trength of my ca&s;e, I have purpo&s;ely omitted, upon this occa&s;ion,

point the evidence to a matter which I do not believe there is a man &s;o

gro&s;sly and &s;o long impo&s;ed upon the public, re&s;pecting this matter,
are no more, it may not be unworthy curio&s;ity to explore their origin and
trace their progre&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of the fal&s;e|hoods

difference of opinion in the army, upon the mea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing the
Hud&s;on's River, aro&s;e from the paragraph in my public letter from Albany to
the Secretary of State, wherein I &s;ay that I had called no council upon that
&s;ubject, but had acted upon my own judgment of the peremp|tory tenor of my
orders.</P>
<P>That a man, chief in authority, &s;hould take entirely upon
him&s;elf a mea&s;ure of doubtful con&s;equence, and upon mere principle
preclude him&s;elf from any future means of &s;hifting or dividing the blame
that might en&s;ue, appeared incredible at Whitehall: the greater part of that
political &s;chool concluded the profe&s;&s;ion of &s;uch candour mu&s;t be a
fine&s;&s;e, and that, in fact, the General had not communicated with his
officers, becau&s;e he knew opinions would have been again&s;t him.</P>
<P>When little minds think they have got a clue of littlene&s;s it is
wonderful with what zeal and dexterity they pur&s;ue and improve it.
Corre&s;pondence and intelligence were not wanting; di&s;appointed jobbers,
di&s;carded &s;ervants, di&s;&s;atisfied fugitives of every &s;ort, &s;pies,
tale-bearers, and &s;ycophants, whom it is to the honour of a Gene|ral to have
his enemies, and a di&s;grace to Office to encourage, abounded in town; and the
primary idea once given, it was carried forward by very ready a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
and even logical deduction.&mdash;As thus:</P>
<P>The General declares in his di&s;patch, he called no man into
council upon the mea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing the Hud&s;on's River:
<HI>Therefore,</HI> his officers differed in opinion upon the expediency of
advancing.</P>
<P>To differ in opinion upon that expediency, they mu&s;t con&s;true
his orders not to be peremptory: <HI>Therefore,</HI> he &s;tands &s;ingle in
the interpretation he put upon his orders.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="123"> If his officers &s;aw that he was
unadvi&s;edly and de&s;parately leading his army to death, they would certainly
remon&s;trate: <HI>Therefore,</HI> they remon&s;trated.</P>
<P>The remon&s;trance would naturally be made to him by &s;uperior
officers: <HI>Therefore,</HI> the conclu&s;ion follows; Major General Phillips
and Brigadier General Fra&s;er actu|ally made a remon&s;trance again&s;t
pa&s;&s;ing the Hud&s;on's River.</P>
<P>General Reide&s;el, who was next in rank to General Phillips,
&s;eems to have been forgotten. He was probably overlooked in the eagerne&s;s
to get at General Fra&s;er, on who&s;e name the important &s;tre&s;s was laid,
and for two palpable rea&s;ons; the one, that his name &s;tood high in the
public e&s;timation, and greatly as it de&s;erved &s;o to &s;tand, perhaps it
acquired, upon this intended u&s;e, more ju&s;tice from &s;ome quarters than it
would otherwi&s;e have received.</P>
<P>The &s;econd and more prevalent rea&s;on was, that Brigadier General
Fra&s;er was dead.</P>
<P>Thus then &s;tood the a&s;&s;ertion when I arrived in England: 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Major General Phillips and Brigadier General

having traced this fal&s;ehood to its maturity, it now may be equally curious
to follow its decline.</P>
<P>After my arrival in England, the friend&s;hip, and general
conformity of &s;entiment between General Phillips and me became more known. He
was alive, and might po&s;&s;ibly &s;oon return. His name was therefore
withdrawn from the remon&s;trance, and re&s;erved, in ca&s;e he did not return,

la&s;t efforts of malignity in the cour&s;e of the late enquiry.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t public occa&s;ion that offered was &s;eized by me to
pledge my honour upon the whole &s;tory of di&s;agreement of opinion being
fal&s;e; and I dared any man to produce a letter or a &s;entence, from
Brigadier Fra&s;er or any other officer, to authori&s;e a &s;u&s;picion of its

Hou&s;e of Commons, voluntarily and generou&s;ly entered into my
ju&s;tification, upon the authority of his corre&s;pondence with his late
relation, and the knowledge of his general &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The fal&s;ehood was immediately &s;o far weakened, that the word
<HI>Remon&s;trance</HI> was changed into <HI>Opinion.</HI> 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Brigadier Fra&s;er's opinion was again&s;t

gave the death blow to the la&s;t &s;truggling efforts of that calumny. The
ra&s;hne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ing the Hud&s;on's River was obliterated; every
com|ment upon that <HI>fatal</HI> &s;tep was &s;uddenly dropt, as if the river
had &s;unk under ground; the charge, with the full accompaniment of General
Fra&s;er's di&s;approbation, re|mon&s;trance, &amp;c. &amp;c. was &s;hifted;
the mini&s;ter was as nimble as his confederates, and exclaimed upon the
<HI>fatality</HI> of the expedition to Bennington.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall finally re&s;t the &s;upport I have been &s;o
anxious to derive from that grave which has been ran&s;acked by my
adver&s;aries for evidence again&s;t me. As a &s;oldier I avow a pride in
having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Brigadier Fra&s;er's e&s;teem. As a de|fendant I am
&s;en&s;ible I have dwelt upon it to a fault. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com|ments of an inferior offi|cer no pro|per

&s;uffering the comments of an inferior to be a te&s;t of his actions, requires
an apology to my profe&s;&s;ion. It lies in the eminence of my friend's

confute the calumny that would have robbed me of it; but to admit that it was
nece&s;&s;ary for my acquittal would be to countenance and forward the mo&s;t
pernicious and pre|po&s;terous doctrine that ever was practi&s;ed to mi&s;lead
the public, and to betray the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>When a mini&s;ter or his confederates lean upon private report,
table talk, and half &s;entences, to depreciate an officer they dare not

a&s;pect, is contemptible in the extreme; but it calls for our indignation when
we extend our view to its principle and effects. They operate to the very
inver&s;ion of due patronage, and the ab&s;olute extinction of every idea upon
which command ought to be be&s;towed, or can efficaciou&s;ly be exer|ci&s;ed;
they tend to encourage officers to be &s;pies and informers; to render camps

&s;u&s;picion, di&s;cord, faction, treachery, and mutiny.</P>
<P>The diver&s;ity and importance of the matter brought to review in
the period of the campaign I am now clo&s;ing, has led to greater length than I
was aware of; but I cannot di&s;mi&s;s it without one reference, addre&s;&s;ed
to &s;uch of the examiners of my conduct as have in&s;i&s;ted upon the
tardine&s;s of the northern army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Comparative view of the campaigns in 1759 and
1777.</NOTE>The reference I would plead is to a campaign in the &s;ame country,
memorable for having been conducted by an officer who&s;e example mu&s;t be
acknowledged, at this juncture, to be of &s;plendid and peculiar authority; I
mean the campaign of Lord Amher&s;t, in the year 1759.</P>
<P>The great points of the war in America that year were to divide the
enemy's force, and at the &s;ame time to direct the &s;everal operations with
&s;uch concurrence, that, though &s;eparate and remote, they &s;hould
a&s;&s;i&s;t each other. The fir&s;t objects of the <PB N="119" REF="125"> army
to which I allude were to reduce Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and the ulti|mate
and mo&s;t important one was to effect a junction with Mr. Wolfe before
Quebec.</P>
<P>Thus far there is great &s;imilarity between the plans of the two
campaigns, except that the points from which the armies marched, and to which
they were de&s;tined, were exactly rever&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the Spring, 1759, the army, then a&s;&s;embled at Albany, took
the field as early as the &s;ea&s;on would admit: but &s;uch were the natural
impediments of the country, that though &s;upported by the unanimous zeal of
the inhabitants, and furni&s;hed with abundant &s;upplies of draft cattle,
carriages, water-craft, and every other nece&s;&s;ary; the &s;everal
departments well directed, and no enemy to oppo&s;e the march, the Ge|neral
(Lord Amher&s;t) was not able to commence the attack of Ticonderoga till the
7th of July, when the enemy abandoned that po&s;t, and retreated to Crown
Point.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance from Albany to Fort George is between &s;ixty and
&s;eventy miles, the pa&s;&s;age over Lake George to Ticonderoga about forty
miles.</P>
<P>The General had rea&s;on to believe that Crown Point would be given
up at his approach as precipitately as Ticonderoga had been. He did not,
however, reach it, a di&s;tance of thirteen miles, and water-carriage at will,
till the 14th of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Was it at that time a&s;ked by the mini&s;ter or his adherents, what
was the army doing not to pur&s;ue a flying enemy?&mdash;Not to pur&s;ue when
the whole country behind was their own, and magazines, baggage, ho&s;pitals,
and every other nece&s;&s;ary, might follow at lei&s;ure, and in &s;ecurity!
When it was fore&s;een an encrea&s;e of fleet was to be con&s;tructed at Crown
Point, to obtain the &s;uperiority over the enemy upon Lake Champlain, and
con&s;equently that every day's delay, in becoming ma&s;ter of that po&s;t,
ri&s;ked the campaign!</P>
<P>Although the&s;e enquiries were not then &s;ugge&s;ted to the
public, an an&s;wer to them has been given, greatly to the honour of the
General, in a very impartial hi|&s;tory of that time. 
<Q REND="inline">"The army was employed in repairing the
fortifications at Ticonderoga; and the General took his mea&s;ures with the
&s;ame care as if he ex|pected an ob&s;tinate defence, and attempt to
&s;urpri&s;e him on his march."</Q></P>
<P>The enemy actually did abandon Crown Point on the approach of the
General, the 14th of Augu&s;t; and, as &s;oon as in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
po&s;t, he &s;et about fortify|ing it as he had done Ticonderoga. The time
con&s;umed in that operation, and in building new ve&s;&s;els, brought it to
the middle of October before the General could embark upon the Lake. A
&s;u&s;pence, undoubtedly, of great anxiety; for the great end of the campaign,
the junction of the two armies, upon which the reduc|tion of all Canada was
thought to depend, was unattained.</P>
<P>But did the mini&s;ter or his adherents <HI>then</HI> cavil at the
tardine&s;s of that army?&mdash;Enterpri&s;ing, &s;anguine, and impetuous, as
was the character of that mini&s;ter's <PB N="120" REF="126"> councils, there
was not le&s;s energy in his protection. The nation, not a party, were his
adherents; and his word was a <HI>fiat</HI> of fame. He be&s;towed emphatic
prai&s;es on his General; and a failing campaign became part of that ba&s;is,
from which he has a&s;cended to the high honours he now de&s;ervedly
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>It would be great pre&s;umption, and it is far from being intended,
to draw any parallels or inferences from the campaigns of 1759 and 1777, except
&s;uch as merely apply to con&s;umption of time under &s;imilar
circum&s;tances. In other points the preten&s;ions of the re&s;pective Generals
may be as different as their fortunes; or, to make a much clearer
di&s;tinction, and a yet &s;tronger contra&s;t, as wide a&s;under as the
au&s;pices under which they &s;erved, tho&s;e of Mr. Pitt and of Lord George
Germain.</P>

addre&s;s, when any little &s;kill and conduct were generally acknowledged, to
call the exi&s;tence of &s;uch movements into que&s;tion. I cannot make this

<P>It will be ob&s;ervable from the accounts of the killed and wounded,
that the lo&s;s of officers in all the actions of the campaign was

&s;hew the folly there would be in bringing a military cau&s;e to a
parliamentary enqui|ry, upon the pre&s;umption that any parts of it would be
left unexamined. The very want of practical knowledge in the enquirers renders
them more inqui&s;itive, and much more tenacious of doubts and &s;urmi&s;es,
than they would otherwi&s;e be: for in|&s;tance; I do not believe that with an
army exhau&s;ted by a long and &s;evere action, and deprived of an uncommon
portion of officers, the que&s;tion of attacking the enemy next morning would
have occurred to any man of profe&s;&s;ional judgment: that enemy too in a
po&s;ition of which no further knowledge could be obtained than that it was
covered by an intrenchment and abattis, and the approach to be made through a
thick wood, without any avenue cut, or a &s;ingle po&s;t fortified to &s;ecure
a retreat, or to cover the magazine, which afforded the only po&s;&s;ible means
of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Equally remote would be the thoughts of military men from attacking
a few days after, when it appeared I had received a letter from Sir Henry
Clinton, informing me of a diver&s;ion &s;o powerful as an attack upon Fort
Montgomery to be undertaken as at that very time.</P>
<P>The que&s;tions relating to the enemy having their baggage packed,
if that circum|&s;tance was meant as an indication that they meant to retreat,
is another proof how <PB N="123" REF="129"> little the que&s;tioners knew of
&s;ervice. It does not appear in evidence how the fact was: but no officer will
di&s;pute, that if the enemy had not only packed their bag|gage, but actually
conveyed it to the other &s;ide the river, they would have acted conformably to
the general practice of &s;ervice when action is expected; and to no
circum&s;tance of &s;ervice more than to that when it is re&s;olved to
di&s;pute a po&s;t to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of my &s;ituation at that time, I am &s;o confident
that it was the part of an officer to fortify and wait events, that I am only
further intent to prove that I fortified properly, the nature of the ground and
my &s;everal purpo&s;es con&s;i|dered. Upon this principle I &s;ubmit the plan
annexed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plan No. V.</NOTE> It will al&s;o &s;hew the na+ture
of the ground between the two armies, and &s;erve to explain the difficulties
the witne&s;&s;es expre&s;s of taking a view of the enemy's left: but it will
be con&s;idered, that be&s;ides the&s;e apparent ob&s;tacles to a near
approach, the enemy abounded in militia, which &s;upplied out-po&s;ts and
&s;couts, that could by no means be driven in without making the army liable to
a general action.</P>
<P>As for any other intelligence than what could be obtained by
eye-&s;ight it was generally contradictory, always imperfect; the de&s;erters
were often &s;u&s;picious, the pri&s;oners very few. I never &s;aw any
in&s;tance of &s;ervice where it was &s;o difficult to obtain information.
Among people &s;peaking the &s;ame language with our&s;elves, and many of them
profe&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t favourable di&s;po&s;itions, &s;carcely any could be
pre|vailed upon, by rewards or principle, to ri&s;k his per&s;on for the
purpo&s;e of intelligence.</P>
<P>In regard to the cro&s;s-examination, re&s;pecting the time
nece&s;&s;ary for the con|&s;truction of the redoubts and other works, I
neither thought it worth while to con|te&s;t it at the time, nor &s;hall I
conte&s;t it now, though nothing would be more ea&s;y than to &s;hew that there
was a great deal of nece&s;&s;ary labour which the que&s;tions did not lead to,
and con&s;equently the witne&s;&s;es could not with propriety enter into the
explanation of them. But what makes the con&s;umption of time to me imma|terial
is, that I place my ju&s;tification upon the expediency of waiting the
co-opera|tion from Sir Henry Clinton. It is in proof, that I received a letter
from him the day after the action of the 19th,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The

Fort Montgomery as at that very time. And as I have already &s;aid, that I

I have deferred it longer, even after being recruit|ed from the ho&s;pital, on

<P>Lady Harriet Ackland had accompanied her hu&s;band to Canada in
the beginning of the year 1776. In the cour&s;e of that campaign &s;he had
traver&s;ed a va&s;t &s;pace of country, in different extremities of
&s;ea&s;on, and with difficulties that an European traveller will not ea&s;ily
conceive, to attend, in a poor hut at Chambl&eacute;e, upon his &s;ick bed.</P>

<P>In the opening of the campaign of 1777 &s;he was re&s;trained
from offering her&s;elf to a &s;hare of the fatigue and hazard expected before
Ticonderoga, by the po&s;itive injunctions of her hu&s;band. The day after the
conque&s;t of that place, he was badly wounded, and &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the Lake
Champlain to join him.</P> 
<P>As &s;oon as he recovered, Lady Harriet proceeded to follow his
fortunes through the campaign, and at Fort Edward, or at the next camp, &s;he
acquired a two-wheel tumbril, which had been con|&s;tructed by the artificers
of the artillery, &s;omething &s;imilar to the carriage u&s;ed for the mail
upon the great roads of England. Major Ackland commanded the Briti&s;h
grenadiers, which were attached to General Fra&s;er's corps; and con&s;equently
were always the mo&s;t advanced po&s;t of the army. Their &s;ituations were
often &s;o alert, that no per&s;on &s;lept out of their cloaths. In one of
the&s;e &s;ituations a tent, in which the major and Lady Harriet were a&s;leep,
&s;uddenly took fire. An orderly &s;erjeant of grenadiers, with great hazard of
&s;uffocation, dragged out the fir&s;t per&s;on he caught hold of. It proved to
be the major. It happened, that in the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;he had, unknowing
what &s;he did, and perhaps not perfectly awake, providentially made her
e&s;cape, by creeping under the walls of the back part of the tent. The fir&s;t
object &s;he &s;aw, upon the recovery of her &s;en&s;es, was the major on the
other &s;ide, and in the &s;ame in&s;tant again in the fire, in &s;earch of
her. The &s;erjeant again &s;aved him, but not without the major being very
&s;everely burned in his face and different parts of the body. Every thing they
had with them in the tent was con&s;umed.</P> 
<P>This accident happened a little time before the army pa&s;&s;ed
the Hud&s;on's River. It neither altered the re&s;olution nor the
chearfulne&s;s of Lady Harriet; and &s;he continued her progre&s;s, a partaker
of the fatigues of the advanced corps. The next call upon her fortitude was of
a different nature, and more di&s;tre&s;sful, as of longer &s;u&s;pen&s;e. On
the march of the 19th, the grenadiers being liable to action at every &s;tep,
&s;he had been directed by the major to follow the route of the artillery and
bag|gage, which was not expo&s;ed. At the time the action began &s;he found
her&s;elf near a &s;mall uninha|bited hut, where &s;he alighted. When it was
found the action was becoming general and bloody, the &s;urgeons of the
ho&s;pital took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame place, as the mo&s;t
convenient for the fir&s;t care of the wounded. Thus was this lady in hearing
of one continued fire of cannon and mu&s;ketry, for four hours together, with
the pre&s;umption, from the po&s;t of her hu&s;band at the head of the
grena|diers, that he was in the mo&s;t expo&s;ed part of the action. She had
three female companions, the Barone&s;s of Reide&s;el and the wives of two
Briti&s;h officers, Major Harnage and Lieutenant Reynell; but in the event
their pre&s;ence &s;erved but little for comfort. Major Harnage was &s;oon
brought to the &s;urgeons, very badly wounded; and a little time after came
intelligence that Lieutenant Reynell was &s;hot dead. Imagination will want no
helps to figure the &s;tate of the whole groupe.</P> 
<P>From the date of that action to the 7th of October, Lady
Harriet, with her u&s;ual &s;erenity, &s;tood prepared for new trials! and it
was her lot that their &s;everity encrea&s;ed with their numbers. She was again
expo&s;ed to the hearing of the whole action, and at la&s;t received the
&s;hock of her individual misfortune, mixed with the intelligence of the
general calamity, the troops were defeated, and Major Ackland, de&s;perately
wounded, was a pri&s;oner.</P> 
<P>The day of the 8th was pa&s;&s;ed by Lady Harriet and her
companions in common anxiety, not a tent, nor a &s;hed being &s;tanding, except
what belonged to the Ho&s;pital, their refuge was among the wounded and the

action then in his &s;houlder) &s;he rowed down the river to meet the enemy.
But her di&s;tre&s;&s;es were not yet to end. The night was advanced before the
boat reached the enemy's out-po&s;ts, and the centinel would not let it pa&s;s,
nor even come on &s;hore. In vain Mr. Brudenell offered the flag of truce, and
repre&s;ented the &s;tate of the extraordinary pa&s;&s;enger. The guard,
apprehen&s;ive of treachery, and punctilious to their orders, threatened to
fire into the boat if it &s;tirred before day light. Her anxiety and
&s;uffering were thus protracted through &s;e|ven or eight dark and cold hours;
and her reflections upon that fir&s;t reception could not give her very
encouraging ideas of the treatment &s;he was afterwards to expect. But it is
due to ju&s;tice at the clo&s;e of this adventure to &s;ay, that &s;he was
received and accommodated by General Gates with all the humanity and re&s;pect
that her rank, her merits and her fortunes de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Let &s;uch as are affected by the&s;e circum&s;tances of alarm,
hard&s;hip and danger, recollect, that the &s;ubject of them was a woman; of
the mo&s;t tender and delicate frame; of the gentle&s;t manners; habituated to
all the &s;oft elegancies, and refined enjoyments, that attend high birth and
fortune; and far advanced in a &s;tate in which the tender cares, always due to
the &s;ex, become indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary. Her mind alone was formed
for &s;uch trials.</P>

For a proof that &s;uch was their opinion, I refer to the te&s;timony of Lord
Balcarras.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections upon the convention.</NOTE>A fair
judgment upon recent events is hardly to be expected, e&s;pecially while many
prejudices are alive. It will be allowed me to a&s;&s;ume, what no one has ever
ventured to deny, that there may be a combination of circum&s;tances under
which an army may be ju&s;tified in treating with an enemy. That the army under
my com|mand was under &s;uch circum&s;tances at Saratoga is al&s;o generally
acknowledged: but what is not denied to me from my own &s;ituation, is
attempted to be withheld, by &s;ome, on account of the quality of the enemy.
They &s;ugge&s;t that there &s;hould be no treaty with rebels. It is
unnece&s;&s;ary in an&s;wer to have recour&s;e to hi&s;tory. I will not take
defence from treaties between Spain, the haughtie&s;t power of the world, and
the arch-rebel the great Prince of Orange; nor between Charles the Fir&s;t and
the arch-rebels the Engli&s;h Parliament (for &s;uch in both in&s;tances they
were called) I need only refer to the examples exi&s;ting at that time in
America, <PB N="132" REF="138"> and &s;ince much improved on at home. My
&s;uperior officer in America, with the approbation of government, had treated
upon different occa&s;ions with General Wa&s;hington. The Briti&s;h government
in its highe&s;t collective authority, the King in Parliament, has &s;ince
commi&s;&s;ioned five members of that Parliament, the one a peer, the others of
eminent &s;tation in military and civil capacities, to <HI>treat with</HI>
rebels, I had almo&s;t &s;aid to <HI>&s;ue</HI> to rebels for peace, by the
&s;urrender of almo&s;t every principle for the maintenance of which they had
pro&s;ecuted the war.</P>
<P>Thus highly ju&s;tified in treating with rebels, I am at a lo&s;s to
di&s;cover by what po&s;&s;ible mode of defence I could have acquitted my&s;elf
to God or my country, when the brave and intelligent officers of my army
unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, upon military principle, precedent and rea&s;on, that
the treaty was expedient, and the terms honourable, if I had delivered them up
to certain de&s;truction, or even to be pri&s;oners at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>If the informed and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate part of mankind &s;hould
agree in &s;entiment with the unanimous voice of the army, upon the convention
of Saratoga, &s;urely to impute to it the final lo&s;s of the army is too
palpable an inju&s;tice long to remain upon the minds of the mo&s;t prejudiced.
The convention expre&s;sly pre&s;erved the army for the &s;ervice of the
&s;tate. According to that convention a truce was made during the war, between
that army and the enemy, in America, and it now might have been acting
again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Bourbon in any other part of the world. The army was
lo&s;t by the non-compliance with the treaty on the part of the Congre&s;s; and
that violation of faith no man will ever be found to ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>I will not decide how far it was encouraged in America, by the
per&s;ua&s;ion that the mini&s;try of Britain had neither power nor &s;pirit to
redre&s;s the wrong; and that they had &s;unk the nation &s;o low, in point of
re&s;pect, that the world would over|look, where &s;he was concerned, an action
that would have excited, in any other ca&s;e, univer&s;al cen&s;ure and
indignation. But whatever motives the Congre&s;s may have had, the tamene&s;s
and &s;ilence with which the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters have borne this outrage, is
a&s;toni&s;hing. That men &s;o con&s;tant and &s;o prodigal in their anger
again&s;t the Congre&s;s, as never before to have failed in expre&s;&s;ing it,
even in ca&s;es where it bordered upon being ridiculous, &s;hould on a &s;udden
become cold and mute, and dead to feeling, in a ca&s;e where re&s;entment was
ju&s;tly founded, can hardly be accounted for, except upon the principle that
it was better to &s;uppre&s;s the ju&s;te&s;t cen&s;ure upon a power they
dete&s;ted, than that even a particle of unme|rited odium &s;hould be wanting
to load the man whom they were re&s;olved to depre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>I AM not aware that in the preceding Review of Evidence I have
neglected any part e&s;&s;ential to my defence. I do not reckon as &s;uch, that
part which applies to the management of the public pur&s;e. The calumny
de&s;igned to wound me upon that head was too gro&s;s to &s;ucceed: it
peri&s;hed in its birth, and &s;corn is the only &s;entiment excited by the
remembrance of its momentary exi&s;tence. In regard to the more plau&s;ible
objections pointed again&s;t my conduct, I have not only endea|voured to meet
them in the cro&s;s-examination, but have &s;earched for them in every place
where I could &s;uppo&s;e them to originate or be entertained. If &s;ome have
e&s;caped, I &s;hall &s;tand excu&s;ed, when it is recollected how they have
grown and changed from one &s;hape to another, and that it has never been my
fortune to be confronted with an avowed and regular accu&s;er&mdash;I de&s;pair
of ever being &s;o: but I de&s;ire it to be under&s;tood, that although I am
earne&s;t in this mode of defence, I am &s;o far from declining another, that I
&s;hall think it one very happy circum&s;tance of the pa&s;t enquiry, if any
thing contained in it &s;hould have effect hereafter to pro|duce an enquiry by
court-martial.</P>
<P>It would not be an ungrateful ta&s;k to follow the defence of the
campaign with a detail of the occurrences which happened between the time of
&s;igning the conven|tion and my leaving America. Many of them would be found
curious; and the cares and perplexities in which I bore a principal and mo&s;t
painful part, would create a new intere&s;t in the minds of my friends: but I
do not think my&s;elf at liberty, upon the plan I laid down at my out&s;et, to
enter into matter where no blame is imputed or implied. If my proceedings
during that interval de&s;erve any credit, I am content with that te&s;timony
of it, which I may a&s;&s;ume from the &s;ilence of my enemies.</P>
<P>I have not the &s;ame rea&s;ons for pa&s;&s;ing over the
tran&s;actions in which I have been engaged &s;ince my return to England,
becau&s;e blame, and of a very atrocious na|ture, <HI>has</HI> been imputed to
me. But as the principal of the&s;e tran&s;actions are already before the
public, I &s;hall mention them very briefly; and merely to introduce
con|nectedly &s;uch further thoughts upon them as could not with propriety be
&s;tated upon any former occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Immediately after my arrival, a board of general officers was
appointed to en|quire into the cau&s;es of the failure of the expedition from
Canada. This enquiry was made the foundation of an order again&s;t my appearing
at court.</P>
<P>The board reported, that they could not take cognizance of me being
under parole&mdash;the prohibition from the King's pre&s;ence neverthele&s;s
&s;till remained in force.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="140"> I had recour&s;e to parliament for enquiry; and
openly, and repeatedly, and &s;trenu|ou&s;ly called upon the mini&s;ters to
join i&s;&s;ue with me before that tribunal. Objec|tion was taken again&s;t
immediate enquiry, becau&s;e Generals Sir Guy Carleton and Sir William Howe who
might be parties were ab&s;ent; but it was evidently the di&s;|po&s;ition of
the hou&s;e, that an enquiry &s;hould be in&s;tituted the en&s;uing
&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I pledged my&s;elf zealou&s;ly to pro&s;ecute that mea&s;ure; I
accu&s;ed mini&s;ters of inju|rious treatment towards my&s;elf; and it became
my duty, upon occa&s;ions with which my own affairs had no connection, to
expre&s;s deeper re&s;entments of their conduct towards the public.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of things parliament was prorogued on the 3<HI>d of
June.</HI> On the 5<HI>th of June,</HI> I received the fir&s;t order to repair
to Bo&s;ton as &s;oon as I had tried the Bath waters. The order and my
an&s;wer, repre&s;enting the hard&s;hip of being &s;ent back unheard, and the
&s;econd conditional order, with entire &s;light of my repre&s;entations, are
too well known to require repetition: but there are two circum&s;tances
attending the dates of the&s;e orders with which I was not acquainted till long
after, and which have never yet been taken notice of.</P>
<P>The one is, that at the very time I was told that my pre&s;ence was
<HI>material,</HI> and (as the &s;econd letter from the &s;ecretary at war
expre&s;&s;ed) of <HI>&s;o much importance to the troops detained pri&s;oners
in New England,</HI> that it mu&s;t not be di&s;pen&s;ed with&mdash;at that
very time, it was determined to ratify the convention, according to the
requi&s;ition of the Congre&s;s; and to tran&s;mit the ratification through
other hands, and without any participation with me, or employment of me, in
carrying it to a conclu&s;ion. It was very po&s;&s;ible, the troops might have
been &s;ailed for England before I had reached America, had I even complied as
early as the condition of either order could po&s;&s;ibly be con&s;trued to
pre&s;cribe. But at all events, the circum&s;tance could not but &s;erve to
mark <HI>to me</HI> the true intent and meaning of the order beyond a
po&s;&s;i|bility of mi&s;take&mdash;<HI>that it was an order of vindictive
puni&s;hment;</HI> and my pre&s;ence with the troops, if I reached America in
time, was <HI>material</HI> and <HI>important</HI> to mark to <HI>them</HI> the
degree of di&s;grace to which I was reduced. The terms are a mockery, and an
in&s;ult upon common &s;en&s;e, if applied, in the &s;ituation in which I was
placed, to the &s;ervice of the King, or the con&s;olation of the troops. Such
a di&s;play of ven|geance might indeed be intended to apply to their prudence,
and to act as a cau|tion and warning how at their return they &s;hould
&s;upport a General under the extre|mity of the King's di&s;plea&s;ure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In times when the maintenance of the con&s;titution in its
purity is the ruling principle of an admi|ni&s;tration, the King's name is
introduced by office only to denote an act of the executive part of the
&s;tate. In times when an admini&s;tration mean to rule by the influence of
monarchy, the language of office is to connect the royal per&s;on with the act,
and to give him attributes of pa&s;&s;ion and di&s;plea&s;ure, from which in
his political character he is held exempt. I di&s;claim language and ideas &s;o
uncon&s;titu|tional and di&s;re&s;pectful, and never mean to allude to my
Sovereign per&s;onally, but in acts of ju&s;tice and mercy.</NOTE></P>
<P>The other circum&s;tance attending the&s;e dates is not le&s;s
remarkable, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="141"> The determination of changing the nature of the
war, as afterwards declared by the commi&s;&s;ioners in America, mu&s;t have
been taken at this time.</P>
<P>I am very much di&s;inclined to believe, that the con&s;ideration of
my per&s;on as a proper victim upon that occa&s;ion was ever regularly and
formally debated in the cabinet: but I cannot think it uncharitable to the
individual advi&s;er of the Crown, whoever he was, who could project &s;uch an
order, to &s;uppo&s;e, that if upon the fir&s;t exerci&s;e of <HI>the extremes
of war</HI> on the one &s;ide, and in the ardour of retaliation on the other,
it had &s;o happened, that an object &s;o well to be &s;pared as an obnoxious
and di&s;graced Lieutenant General, had opportunely pre&s;ented it&s;elf to the
enemy's rigour, and had been detained in their pri&s;ons, the order for the
voyage would not have been thought, by that individual, quite thrown away.
Detention, with or without the troops, of a trouble&s;ome and bold complainant,
could not be immate|rial or unimportant to &s;uch a per&s;on, and the order was

<P>The living pre&s;ence of an injured man is, perhaps, more offen&s;ive
and in&s;up|portable to the &s;ight of a mean injurer, that the &s;pectre of
him would be after death.</P>
<P>But to return to the facts I was recapitulating.</P>
<P>I remained under the conditional order in England.</P>
<P>The en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion, the parliamentary enquiry now laid before
the public took place. It ended, as has been &s;tated, in July, 1779.</P>
<P>In September, I received a &s;evere reprimand, a denial of a
court-martial, and a prohibition of &s;erving my country in its exigence,
though other officers preci&s;ely in my &s;ituation were employed&mdash;I
re&s;igned.</P>
<P>The blame laid upon me for the part I took in the&s;e tran&s;actions
is, that intem|perately and factiou&s;ly I engaged in oppo&s;ition; that I was
guilty of di&s;obedience to the King's orders; and it has been added in a late
publication, that even my de|fence of my conduct is a libel upon the King's
government.</P>
<P>I think I have perceived, that the fir&s;t part of the&s;e charges, a
ra&s;h engagement in oppo&s;ition, is not combated by &s;ome who wi&s;h me well
&s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly as other imputations have been. It may po&s;&s;ibly have
appeared to friendly and prudential ob&s;ervers, as a palliating plea for a
re&s;titution to favour upon &s;ome future occa&s;ion, to have to &s;ay, that I
had acted upon the &s;udden impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion; and the &s;equel might
be, that I had repented, and would offend no more.</P>
<P>Without doubting the kindne&s;s which &s;ugge&s;ts the&s;e excu&s;es,
I have been im|pelled by principles too forcible, and have taken my part too
decidedly, to look for a re&s;ource in tho&s;e or any other &s;ubterfuges. It
would be incon&s;i&s;tent and di&s;|honourable in me to withhold a public
declaration upon this occa&s;ion, in addition <PB N="136" REF="142"> to tho&s;e
I have made upon others, that I engaged in re&s;i&s;tance to the mea&s;ures of
the court upon mature reflection; that after collecting in my mind all the
lights upon men and things which my experience and ob&s;ervation could
furni&s;h, I be|lieved that the con&s;titution of England was betrayed: and
neither blaming or &s;u&s;pecting any men who conceived different opinions, and
acted upon them, I thought it a point of time in which a man believing as I did
was called upon to &s;acrifice to his country. The te&s;t of this motive, it is
true, mu&s;t re&s;t between God and my con&s;cience: but let it not be
&s;uppo&s;ed that I acted blindly&mdash;the path of intere&s;t, a broad and
beaten track, lay clearly before me from the time I arrived in England. Supple
joints, and an attentive eye, always giving way to power, on one &s;ide, and
&s;ometimes pu&s;hing my friends into the dirt on the other, would have carried
me &s;afely through. I even believe, that the advi&s;er of the letters I lately
alluded to would rather have &s;een me in that track, than in the other which
he pre|&s;cribed for me acro&s;s the Atlantic.</P>
<P>As little would I be &s;uppo&s;ed to want di&s;cernment of the path I
took: for the barefaced preferences, rewards and puni&s;hments held forth for
parliamentary conduct, were among the mo&s;t glaring parts of the &s;y&s;tem I
had contemplated. And it was impo&s;&s;ible to doubt, that as a delinquent
<HI>there,</HI> I &s;hould be pre&s;&s;ed both by art and vengeance to the end
the enemies I had provoked fore&s;aw&mdash;the lo&s;s of my profe&s;&s;ion and
the impoveri&s;hment of my fortune. I tru&s;t it will be an inno|cent revenge
on my part, to &s;hew them I can bear my condition firmly; and that I am
incapable of redeeming what I have lo&s;t, were it ever in my option, by the
di&s;avowal of a &s;ingle principle I have profe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I come now to the &s;econd charge, di&s;obedience of orders; and in a
point that &s;o nearly touches the very e&s;&s;ence of military character, I
tru&s;t I &s;hall not tre&s;|pa&s;s upon the patience of the reader, if I treat
it a little more at large than I have done in my corre&s;pondence with the
&s;ecretary at war.</P>
<P>I admit that &s;ubordination and implicit obedience, as applied to the
operation of arms, are primary principles in the military &s;y&s;tem. An army
is a mere name without them. The officer who he&s;itates to meet certain death
upon command, de&s;erves to receive it from the hand of the executioner.</P>
<P>But there are po&s;&s;ible exceptions to the&s;e general principles,
e&s;pecially out of the field, in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;ervices; and in the
Briti&s;h &s;ervice they are known and marked, and co-exi&s;tent with the
military e&s;tabli&s;hment it&s;elf, in the mutiny act, which confines
obedience to legal commands. An army mu&s;t again be garbled like the army of
Cromwell (which God avert!) before an order could be executed, like that of
Cromwell, for garbling the parliament.</P>
<P>A high &s;pirit will contract the limits of obedience &s;till more;
with illegal, he will reject di&s;honourable commands; and he will follow the
rea&s;oning I have al|ready premi&s;ed, and &s;tate it as a maxim thus: <HI>he
who obeys at the expence of for|tune,</HI> <PB N="137" REF="143"> <HI>comfort,
health and life, is a &s;oldier; he who obeys at the expence of honour is a
&s;lave.</HI></P>
<P>But I may be a&s;ked by &s;ome di&s;ciplinarians, who is to be the
judge in the&s;e nice definitions of obedience? It is uncommon military
doctrine, I may be told, to rea|&s;on upon the King's orders&mdash;I confe&s;s
it is &s;o. Since the reign of James the Second, in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice it
never has been nece&s;&s;ary. We have been u&s;ed in this age, to &s;ee the
King's name give wings and in&s;piration to duty. Di&s;cipline, in this
country, has been rai&s;ed upon per&s;onal honour&mdash;a firmer ba&s;is than
fear or &s;ervility ever furni&s;hed: and the mini&s;ter who fir&s;t &s;hakes
that happy confidence; who turns military command to political craft; who dares
to u&s;e his gracious Sovereign's name as an engine of &s;tate, to glut his own
anger, or to remove his own fears, he is among&s;t the wor&s;t enemies to that
Sovereign. But &s;hould his purpo&s;es go further (a con&s;ideration of far
greater magnitude to the public) and &s;hould it be &s;een that the royal name
was brought forth for the <HI>di&s;cipline</HI> of parliament, the mini&s;ter
&s;o u&s;ing it would be not only an enemy to his Sovereign, but a traitor to
the con&s;titu|tion of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I will clo&s;e the defence of my principles re&s;pecting military
&s;ubordination by re|ference to an anecdote well authenticated and not very
remote.</P>
<P>An officer in a neighbouring nation, for &s;ome error he had committed
in a day of battle, received a blow from his prince who commanded in per&s;on.
The officer drew a pi&s;tol, and his fir&s;t movement was to point it at his
ma&s;ter; but the next (and it was in&s;tantaneous) was to turn the muzzle, and
di&s;charge the ball into his own heart. Though my ca&s;e differs both in the
provocation and the con&s;equence, in many circum&s;tances my conduct may
ju&s;tly be &s;upported upon the &s;ame princi|ple. I receive an affront that a
liberal &s;pirit cannot endure; and in a name, again&s;t which no per&s;onal
re&s;entment can be pur&s;ued, nor indeed entertained: but a &s;uicide of my
profe&s;&s;ional exi&s;tence (if I may be allowed the phra&s;e) is preferable
to the &s;tate in which the affront placed me. In one in&s;tance only I
renounce the parallel&mdash;God forbid I &s;hould be thought, even in a bur&s;t
of pa&s;&s;ion, to have pointed at my Sovereign! It was not from his hand I
received the blow.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;olicit the reader's attention very little further: but I
feel the nece&s;&s;ity of repeating my application to the candour of the
public, both as a writer and an appellant. Defence, and imputation of blame to
others, are naturally interwoven in my cau&s;e: it required a more di&s;tinct
conception, and an abler hand than mine, to keep them always apart, and open to
&s;eparate view. In &s;ome parts my defence may be weakened by this deficiency
of &s;kill: but I have no right to offer the &s;ame excu&s;e for &s;uffering
any blame to re&s;t upon others beyond what I thought my&s;elf ju&s;tified to
&s;upport.</P>
<P>Upon this principle, I think it ju&s;t, at taking leave of the
&s;ecretary of &s;tate for the American department, briefly to enumerate the
only facts and propo&s;itions re|&s;pecting <PB N="138" REF="144"> the plan of
the expedition from Canada, that I think clearly maintainable again&s;t
him.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t fact. It is clear that the plan of a junction of the greater
part of the forces in Canada with the army of Sir William Howe, was formed in
the year 1776, when Sir William Howe was in full &s;ucce&s;s; when his whole
force was in the neighbourhood of New York, or in the Jer&s;ies, and Mr.
Wa&s;hington was beaten, and at the weake&s;t.</P>
<P>Second fact. This plan of a junction was continued (and upon ju&s;t
rea&s;oning) in the clo&s;e of the year 1776, when Sir William Howe's fir&s;t
propo&s;al of operations for the en&s;uing campaign arrived. Tho&s;e
propo&s;als were made upon the datum of a number of troops, &s;ufficient to
furni&s;h, be&s;ides the main army, an <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> army of 10,000 men,
rank and file, to act on the &s;ide of Rhode I&s;land, by taking
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Providence, and penetrating from thence into the country
towards Bo&s;ton; and another <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> army, not le&s;s than
10,000, to move up the North River to Alba|ny, exclu&s;ive of 5000 for the
defence of New York.</P>
<P>In either of the above ca&s;es, the plan of junction could hardly have
failed of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Third fact. On the 23d of February, Sir William Howe's alteration of
the fir&s;t plan was received, and he then propo&s;ed to act with the greater
part of his force on the &s;ide of Philadelphia, at the opening of the
campaign, and to enable him &s;o to do, to defer the <HI>offen&s;ive plan from
Rhode I&s;land till the reinforcements &s;hould arrive,</HI> and to de&s;tine
only 3000 men to act <HI>defen&s;ively</HI> upon the lower part of the
Hud&s;on's River.</P>
<P>Fourth fact. On the 3d of March, the &s;ecretary of &s;tate
&s;ignified his Maje&s;ty's entire approbation of this deviation from the plan
fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts ari&s;es my fir&s;t propo&s;ition, that at the time
the change of plan for Sir William Howe's operations was adopted, by which no
offen&s;ive force was to remain upon the Hud&s;on's River, nor a diver&s;ion
probably to take place from Rhode I&s;land, the plan of my operations, the
&s;ucce&s;s of which would probably de|pend in a great degree upon co-operation
and diver&s;ion, ought to have been changed likewi&s;e: in&s;tead of that, it
was enforced and made po&s;itive by the refu&s;al of the latitude I had
propo&s;ed of acting upon the Connecticut, or, in ca&s;e of exigency, embarking
the troops and effecting the junction by &s;ea.</P>
<P>Fifth fact. On the 19th of March, a letter from Sir William Howe, by
the &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate, acquainting him, that a brigade of Briti&s;h and
&s;ome companies of bri|gadiers and light infantry had been withdrawn from
Rhode I&s;land, which made the force left there merely defen&s;ive. The &s;ame
letter mentions the pro&s;pects the ene|my had of bringing 50,000 men into the
field.</P>
<P>Sixth fact. I did not leave England till the beginning of April, by
which time the &s;ecretary of &s;tate mu&s;t have known, or ought to have
known, that no depen|dance could be placed upon reinforcements from England
arriving at New York in time for Sir William Howe to re&s;ume the intention he
had deferred, viz. a diver&s;ion <PB N="139" REF="145"> from Rhode I&s;land, or
of making the force upon the Hud&s;on's River adequate to offen&s;ive
operation.</P>
<P>Hence ari&s;es my &s;econd propo&s;ition, that the latitude I had
propo&s;ed, or other expedients of precaution, ought then at lea&s;t to have
been adopted: in&s;tead of which, I was &s;uffered to &s;ail, ignorant of Sir
William Howe's plans, and ignorant of the defalcation or the delays in the
reinforcements de&s;tined for him. The con|&s;equence was, that neither his
letter to Sir Guy Carleton, put into my hands after my arrival in Canada, nor
his letter to me of the 17th of June, informing me of his de&s;tination for
Pen&s;ylvania, removed my expectation of co-operation, becau&s;e I was to
&s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ub&s;equent to the dates of either of tho&s;e letters, he
would re|ceive orders from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate re&s;pecting the
junction, and al&s;o a timely reinforcement.</P>
<P>Seventh fact. The &s;ecretary of &s;tate makes no mention of the
northern expedi|tion in any of his di&s;patches to Sir William Howe at the end
of March, when my orders were fixed, nor in the month of April. And it is a
further fact, that I am per&s;uaded will not be conte&s;ted, that he did not
mention any orders or recommenda|tions relative to co-operation verbally to Sir
William Howe's aid-de-camp, or any other confidential per&s;on who &s;ailed
about that time.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t mention made of the nece&s;&s;ity of co-operation was in
the &s;ecretary of &s;tate's letter of the 18<HI>th of May,</HI> wherein his
Lord&s;hip 
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Tru&s;ts that whatever he [Sir William Howe] may
meditate, it will be executed in time to co-operate with the army ordered to
proceed from Canada.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The propo&s;ition clearly ju&s;tified by the&s;e facts is, that if the
&s;ecretary of &s;tate had thought proper to &s;ignify the King's expectation
of a co-operation to be made in my favour in the month of March or beginning of
April, as in con&s;i&s;tency he ought to have done, it would have arrived
before Sir William Howe embarked his army, and in time for him to have made a
new di&s;po&s;ition: but in&s;tead of that, this very material injunction was
not di&s;patched till it was almo&s;t phy&s;ically impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould
have any effect. And &s;o indeed it happened, for Sir William Howe received it
on the 16th of Augu&s;t, at a di&s;tance from Hud&s;on's River too great for
any de|tachment from his own army to be made in time, could it even have been
&s;pared; and the reinforcement from England, upon which Sir William Howe
depended to &s;trengthen Sir Henry Clinton, was much later &s;till&mdash;too
late (as it has been &s;hewn) to enable that general with all his activity and
zeal to give any effectual &s;upport.</P>
<P>Indeed the conduct of the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in in&s;erting this
paragraph, in his letter of the 18th of May, when it could not avail, after
omitting it when certainly it would have been timely, &s;eems &s;o
prepo&s;terous, that it can only be explained by one fact. It tran&s;pired
about that time, that Sir William Howe's a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">y was de&s;tined for Pen&s;ylvania, and people who had con&s;idered
the force of the enemy to be collect|ed from the northern provinces began to be
alarmed for my army. It is well known <PB N="140" REF="146"> (though I cannot
a&s;certain the date) that an officer of very great ability, and a per|fect
knowledge in the country through which I was to pa&s;s, as &s;oon as he heard
no di&s;po&s;ition was made for a &s;upport from New York, foretold to the
&s;ecretary of &s;tate, or his near friends, the fall of my army. Under this
apprehen&s;ion it might appear to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate a proper caution,
that an expectation of co-operation &s;hould exi&s;t under his hand.</P>
<P>If plans &s;o incon&s;i&s;tently formed, and managed by the
&s;ecretary of &s;tate with &s;o much &s;eeming confidence, as to mi&s;lead his
generals, and &s;o much real re&s;erve as to de&s;troy them, &s;hould be
defended by that infatuated belief then entertained of the inability of the
enemy to re&s;i&s;t, I &s;hould beg leave to &s;tate, as one propo&s;ition
more, that after the experience of their actions at Trenton, and many other
places, and the intelligence of their new levies received from Sir William
Howe, &s;uch con|fidence was an additional fault, and perhaps a more pernicious
one than any I have &s;tated.</P>
<P>Thus much for the noble Lord in his public capacity. What &s;hare of
the per&s;e|cution I have &s;u&s;tained (more than I have directly
expre&s;&s;ed in different parts of my defence) are imputable to his private
councils, is not within my knowledge: but if in &s;peaking of my per&s;ecutors
in general, I may be thought &s;ometimes to have u&s;ed &s;trong terms, I have
only to &s;ay, that having advanced no fact which I am not able and re&s;olved
to maintain, I have not felt my&s;elf called upon, in applying tho&s;e facts
for any further attention, than to pre&s;erve the language of a gentleman,
which is an attention due to my&s;elf as well as to the public. It is open and
manly enmity alone that unites re&s;pect with re&s;entment.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could as ea&s;ily apologi&s;e for all the other faults with
which this under|taking abounds as a compo&s;ition. At a time when &s;o many
pens are employed, I mu&s;t not expect to be &s;pared. I &s;hall treat with
&s;ilent re&s;pect any comments that are fairly founded and delivered with
liberality; and with contempt, equally &s;ilent, the common invectives of the
political pre&s;s. This appeal is not to re&s;t upon li|terary critici&s;m, or
party di&s;putation, but upon the broad equity of my country. I know that
prejudice and malice will vani&s;h before the man who dares to &s;ubmit his
actions to that te&s;t&mdash;If acquitted <HI>there,</HI> I feel I am not
degraded; and I have not a &s;en&s;ation within my brea&s;t which does not at
the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ure me, I can|not be unhappy.</P>

<LETTER>
<P>THE rapid &s;ucce&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's arms, in driving the
rebels out of Canada, does great honour to your conduct, and I hope &s;oon to
hear that you have been able to pur&s;ue them acro&s;s the lakes, and to
po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e po&s;ts upon the frontiers which may effectually &s;ecure
your province from any future in&s;ult.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="148"> His Maje&s;ty, in appointing you commander
in chief of his forces in Canada, was plea&s;ed to extend your commi&s;&s;ion
to the frontiers of his provinces bordering thereupon, wi&s;ely fore&s;eeing,
that it might be nece&s;&s;ary for the compleating your plan of operations,
that you &s;hould march your army beyond the limits of your own government. I
tru&s;t, before this letter reaches you, that you will, by your &s;pirit and
activity, have cleared the frontiers of Canada of all the rebel forces, and
will have taken the proper mea&s;ures for keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
lakes. That &s;ervice being performed, his Maje&s;ty commands me to acquaint
you, that there &s;till remains another part of your duty to be undertaken,
which will require all your abilities and the &s;tricte&s;t application, the
re&s;toring peace, and the e&s;tabli&s;h|ing good order and legal government in
Canada. It is an object of the greate&s;t importance to this country, the
difficulties attending it are immen&s;e; but his Maje&s;ty depends upon your
zeal, and upon your experience, for carrying it into execution. His Maje&s;ty,
ever anxious for the happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects, com|mands me to inform you,
that no time &s;hould be lo&s;t in beginning &s;o important a work, and that
you do therefore return to Quebec, detaching Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, or
&s;uch other officer as you &s;hall think mo&s;t proper, with that part of your
forces which can be &s;pared from the immediate defence of your province, to
carry on &s;uch operations as &s;hall be mo&s;t conducive to the &s;ucce&s;s of
the army acting on the &s;ide of New-York; and that you direct the officer &s;o
detached to commu|nicate with and put him&s;elf, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible,
under the command of General Howe, you will order &s;uch artillery as you
&s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary to proceed with this detachment; and as a great
quantity of heavy cannon and military &s;tores were &s;ent, upon the
&s;uppo&s;ition that Quebec might have been in the hands of the rebels, you
will, upon requi&s;ition from General Howe, &s;upply him with &s;uch cannon and
&s;tores as may not be wanted for the protection of Canada.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="appendix">
<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">No. III.</NOTE>Thoughts for conducting the
War from the Side of <HI>Canada.</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Lieutenant-General <HI>Burgoyne.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>WHEN the la&s;t &s;hips came from Quebec, a report prevailed in
Canada, &s;aid to have been founded upon po&s;itive evidence, that the rebels
had laid the keels of &s;everal large ve&s;&s;els at Skene&s;borough and
Ticonderoga, and were re&s;olved to exert their utmo&s;t powers, to con&s;truct
a new and formidable fleet during the winter.</P>
<P>I will not, however, give credit to their exertions, in &s;uch a
degree as to imagine the King's troops will be prevented pa&s;&s;ing Lake
Champlain early in the &s;ummer, but will &s;uppo&s;e the operations of the
army to begin from Crown Point.</P>
<P>But as the pre&s;ent means to form effectual plans is to lay down
every po&s;&s;ible difficulty, I will &s;uppo&s;e the enemy in great force at
Ticonderoga; the different works there are capable of admitting twelve
thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>I will &s;uppo&s;e him al&s;o to occupy Lake George with a
con&s;iderable naval &s;trength, in order to &s;ecure his retreat, and
afterwards to retard the campaign; and it is natural to expect that he will
take mea&s;ures to block up the roads from Ticonderoga to Albany by the way of
Skene&s;borough, by fortifying the &s;trong ground at different places, and
thereby obliging the King's army to carry a <PB N="iii" REF="149"> weight of
artillery with it, and by felling trees, breaking bridges, and other obvious
impediments, to delay, though he &s;hould not have power or &s;pirit finally to
re&s;i&s;t, its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>The enemy thus di&s;po&s;ed upon the &s;ide of Canada, it is to be
con&s;idered what troops will be nece&s;&s;ary, and what di&s;po&s;ition of
them will be mo&s;t proper to pro|&s;ecute the campaign with vigour and
effect.</P>
<P>I humbly conceive the operating army (I mean exclu&s;ively of the
troops left for the &s;ecurity of Canada) ought not to con&s;i&s;t of le&s;s
than eight thou&s;and regulars, rank and file. The artillery required in the
memorandums of General Carleton, a corps of watermen, two thou&s;and Canadians,
including hatchet-men and other workmen, and one thou&s;and or more
&s;avages.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped that the reinforcement and the victualllng
&s;hips may all be ready to &s;ail from the Channel and from Corke on the
la&s;t day of March. I am per|&s;uaded that to &s;ail with a fleet of
tran&s;ports earlier, is to &s;ubject government to lo&s;s and
di&s;appointment. It may rea&s;onably be expected that they will reach Quebec
before the 20th of May, a period in full time for opening the campaign. The
roads, and the rivers and lakes, by the melting and running off of the &s;nows,
are in common years impracticable &s;ooner.</P>
<P>But as the weather long before that time will probably have
admitted of labour in the docks, I will take for granted that the fleet of
la&s;t year, as well bateaux as armed ve&s;&s;els, will be found repaired,
augmented, and fit for immediate &s;ervice. The magazines that remain of
provi&s;ion, I believe them not to be abundant, will probably be formed at
Montreal, Sorel and Chambl&eacute;e.</P>
<P>I conceive the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s for tho&s;e entru&s;ted with
the chief powers, &s;hould be to &s;elect and po&s;t the troops de&s;tined to
remain in Canada; to throw up the military &s;tores and provi&s;ion with all
po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, in which &s;ervice the abovementioned troops, if
properly po&s;ted, will greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t; and to draw the army de&s;tined
for ope|ration to cantonments, within as few days march of St. John's as
conveniently may be. I &s;hould prefer cantonments at that &s;ea&s;on of the
year to encampment, as the ground is very damp, and con&s;equently very
pernicious to the men, and more e&s;pecially as they will have been for many
months before u&s;ed to lodgings, heated with &s;toves, or between decks in
&s;hips; all the&s;e operations may be put in motion together, but they
&s;everally require &s;ome ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I &s;hould wi&s;h that the troops left in Canada, &s;uppo&s;ing
the number mentioned in my former memorandum to be approved, might be made as
follows.

<P><PB N="iv" REF="150"> My rea&s;on for &s;electing the 31&s;t
regiment for this duty is, that when I &s;aw it la&s;t it was not equally in
order with the other regiments for &s;ervices of activity.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e the 29th regiment as it is not at pre&s;ent
brigaded.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e Maclean's corps, becau&s;e I very much apprehend
de&s;ertion from &s;uch parts of it as are compo&s;ed of Americans, &s;hould
they come near the enemy.</P>
<P>In Canada, what&s;oever may be their di&s;po&s;ition, it is not
&s;o ea&s;y to effect it.</P>
<P>And I propo&s;e making up the re&s;idue by detachment, becau&s;e
by &s;electing the men lea&s;t calculated for fatigue or lea&s;t accu&s;tomed
to it, which may be equally good &s;oldiers in more confined movements and
better provided &s;ituations, the effective &s;trength for operation is much
greater and the defen&s;ive &s;trength not impaired.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave to &s;tate the expeditious conveyance of
provi&s;ion and &s;tores from Quebec, and the &s;everal other depo&s;itaries,
in order to form ample magazines at Crown Point, as one of the mo&s;t important
operations of the campaign, becau&s;e it is upon that which mo&s;t of the
re&s;t will depend. If &s;ailing ve&s;&s;els up the St. Lawrence are alone to
be employed, the accident of contrary winds may delay them two months before
they pa&s;s the rapids of Richelieu, and afterwards St. Peter's Lake; delays to
that extent are not uncommon, and they are only to be obviated by having a
quantity of &s;mall craft in readine&s;s to work with oars. From the mouth of
the Sorrel to Chambl&eacute;e, rowing and tacking is a &s;ure conveyance if
&s;ufficient hands are found. From Chambl&eacute;e to St. There&s;e (which is
ju&s;t above the Rapids) land-carriage mu&s;t be u&s;ed, and great authority
will be requi&s;ite to &s;upply the quantity nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>A bu&s;ine&s;s thus complicated in arrangement, in &s;ome parts
unu&s;ual in practice, and in others perhaps difficult, can only be carried to
the de&s;ired effect by the peremptory powers, warm zeal, and con&s;onant
opinion of the governor; and though the former are not to be doubted, a failure
in the latter, vindicated, or &s;eeming to be vindicated, by the plau&s;ible
ob&s;tructions that will not fail to be &s;ugge&s;ted by others, will be
&s;ufficient to cru&s;h &s;uch exertions as an officer of a &s;anguine temper,
entru&s;ted with the future conduct of the campaign, and who&s;e per&s;onal
intere&s;t and fame therefore con&s;equentially depend upon a timely out-&s;et,
would be led to make.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly of the &s;avages and the Canadians will al&s;o
entirely depend upon the governor.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e con&s;iderations, it is pre&s;umed, that the general
officer employed to proceed with the army will be held to be out of the reach
of any po&s;&s;ible blame till he is clear of the province of Canada, and
furni&s;hed with the propo&s;ed &s;upplies.</P>
<P>The navigation of Lake Champlain, &s;ecured by the &s;uperiority
of our naval force, and the arrangements for forming proper magazines &s;o
e&s;tabli&s;hed as to make the execution certain, I would not lo&s;e a day to
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Crown Point with Brigadier Fra&s;er's corps, a large
body of &s;avages, a body of Canadians, both for &s;couts and works, and the
be&s;t of our engineers and artificers well &s;upplied with intrenching
tools.</P>
<P>The brigade would be &s;ufficient to prevent in&s;ult during the
time nece&s;&s;ary for collecting the &s;tores, forming magazines, and
fortifying the po&s;ts; all which &s;hould be done to a certain degree,
previous to proceeding in force to Ticonde|roga; <PB N="v" REF="151"> to &s;uch
a degree I mean as may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be effected in time of
tran&s;|porting artillery, preparing fa&s;cines, and other nece&s;&s;aries for
artillery operations; and by keeping the re&s;t of the army back during that
period, the tran&s;port of provi&s;ions wil be le&s;&s;ened, and the &s;oldiers
made of u&s;e in forwarding the convoys.</P>
<P>But though there would be only one brigade at Crown Point at that
time, it does not follow that the enemy &s;hould remain in a &s;tate of
tranquility. Corps of &s;avages, &s;upported by detachments of light regulars,
&s;hould be continually on foot to keep them in alarm, and within their works
to cover the reconnoitering of general officers and engineers, and to obtain
the be&s;t intelligence of their &s;trength, po&s;ition, and de&s;ign.</P>
<P>If due exertion is made in the preparations &s;tated above, it may
be hoped that Ticonderoga will be reduced early in the &s;ummer, and it will
then become a more proper place for arms than Crown Point.</P>
<P>The next mea&s;ure mu&s;t depend upon tho&s;e taken by the enemy,
and upon the general plan of the campaign as concerted at home. If it be
determined that General Howe's whole forces &s;hould act upon Hud&s;on's River,
and to the &s;outh|ward of it, and that the only object of the Canada army be
to effect a junction with that force, the immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lake
George would be of great con|&s;equence, as the mo&s;t expeditious and mo&s;t
commodious route to Albany; and &s;hould the enemy be in force upon that lake,
which is very probable, every effort &s;hould be tried, by throwing &s;avages
and light troops round it, to oblige them to quit it without waiting for naval
preparations. Should tho&s;e efforts fail, the route by South Bay and
Skene&s;borough might be attempted, but con&s;iderable diffi|culties may be
expected, as the narrow parts of the river may be ea&s;ily choaked up and
rendered impa&s;&s;able, and at be&s;t there will be nece&s;&s;ity for a great
deal of of land carriage for the artillery, provi&s;ion, &amp;c. which can only
be &s;upplied from Canada. In ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s al&s;o by that route, and
the enemy not removed from Lake George, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to leave a
chain of po&s;ts, as the army proceeds, for the &s;ecurities of your
communication, which may too much weaken &s;o &s;mall an army.</P>
<P>Le&s;t all the&s;e attempts &s;hould unavoidably fail, and it
become indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to attack the enemy by water upon Lake
George, the army at the out&s;et &s;hould be provided with carriages,
implements, and artificers, for conveying armed ve&s;&s;els from Ticonderoga to
the lake.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas are formed upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that it be the
&s;ole purpo&s;e of the Canada army to effect a junction with General Howe, or
after co-operating &s;o far as to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Albany and open the
communication to New-York, to remain upon the Hud&s;on's River, and thereby
enable that general to act with his whole force to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the &s;trength of the main American army be &s;uch as
to admit of the corps of troops now at Rhode I&s;land remaining there during
the winter, and acting &s;eparately in the &s;pring, it may be highly worthy
con&s;ideration, whether the mo&s;t important purpo&s;e to which the Canada
army could be employed, &s;uppo&s;ing it in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ticonderoga,
would not be to gain the Connecticut River.</P>
<P>The extent of country from Ticonderoga to the inhabited country
upon that river, oppo&s;ite to Charles Town, is about &s;ixty miles, and though
to convey artil|lery and provi&s;ion &s;o far by land would be attended with
difficulties, perhaps more <PB N="vi" REF="152"> than tho&s;e above
&s;ugge&s;ted, upon a progre&s;s to Skene&s;borough, &s;hould the object appear
worthy, it is to be hoped re&s;ources might be found; in that ca&s;e it would
be advi&s;eable to fortify with one or two &s;trong redoubts the heights
oppo&s;ite to Charles Town, and e&s;tabli&s;h po&s;ts of &s;avages upon the
pa&s;&s;age from Ticonderoga to tho&s;e heights, to pre&s;erve the
communication, and at the &s;ame time prevent any attempt from the country
above Charles Town, which is very populous, from mole&s;ting the rear or
interrupting the convoys of &s;upply, while the army proceeded down the
Connecticut. Sould the junction between the Canada and Rhode I&s;land armies be
effected upon the Connecticut, it is not too &s;anguine an expectation that all
the New England provinces will be reduced by their operations.</P>
<P>To avoid breaking in upon other matter, I omitted in the beginning
of the&s;e papers to &s;tate the idea of an expedition at the out&s;et of the
campaign by the Lake Ontario and O&s;wego to the Mohawk River, which, as a
diver&s;ion to facilitate every propo&s;ed operation, would be highly
de&s;irable, provided the army &s;hould be rein|forced &s;ufficiently to afford
it.</P>
<P>It may at fir&s;t appear, from a view of the pre&s;ent &s;trength
of the army, that it may bear the &s;ort of detachment propo&s;ed by my&s;elf
la&s;t year for this purpo&s;e; but it is to be con&s;idered that at that time
the utmo&s;t object of the campaign, from the advanced &s;ea&s;on and
unavoidable delay of preparation for the lakes, being the reduction of Crown
Point and Ticonderoga, unle&s;s the &s;ucce&s;s of my expedition had opened the
road to Albany, no greater numbers were nece&s;&s;ary than for tho&s;e fir&s;t
operations. The ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent year differs; becau&s;e the &s;ea&s;on
of the year affording a pro&s;pect of very exten&s;ive operation, and
con&s;equently the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of many po&s;ts, patroles, &amp;c. will
become nece&s;&s;ary. The army ought to be in a &s;tate of numbers to bear
tho&s;e drains, and &s;till remain &s;ufficient to attack any thing that
probably can be oppo&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>Nor, to argue from probability, is &s;o much force nece&s;&s;ary
for this diver&s;ion this year, as was required for the la&s;t; becau&s;e we
then knew that General Schuyler with a thou&s;and men, was fortified upon the
Mohawk. When the different &s;itu|ations of things are con&s;idered, viz. the
progre&s;s of General Howe, the early inva&s;ion from Canada, the threatening
of the Connecticut from Rhode I&s;land, &amp;c. it is not to be imagined that
any detachment of &s;uch force as that of Schulyer can be &s;upplied by the
enemy for the Mohawk. I would not therefore propo&s;e it of more (and I have
great diffidence whether &s;o much can be prudently afforded) than Sir John
John&s;on's corps, an hundred Briti&s;h from the &s;econd brigade, and an
hundred more from the 8th regiment, with four pieces of the lighte&s;t
artillery, and a body of &s;avages; Sir John John&s;on to be with a detachment
in per&s;on, and an able field officer to command it. I &s;hould wi&s;h
Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger for that em|ployment.</P>
<P>I particularize the &s;econd brigade, becau&s;e the fir&s;t is
propo&s;ed to be dimini&s;hed by the 31&s;t regiment remaining in Canada, and
the re&s;t of the regiment drafted for the expedition being made al&s;o part of
the Canada force, the two brigades will be exactly &s;quared.</P>
<P>Should it appear, upon examination of the really effective numbers
of the Canada army, that the force is not &s;ufficient for proceeding upon the
above ideas with a fair pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, the alternative remains of
embarking the army at Quebec, in order to effect a junction with General Howe
by &s;ea, or to be employed &s;epa|rately <PB N="vii" REF="153"> rately to
co-operate with the main de&s;igns, by &s;uch means as &s;hould be within their
&s;trength upon other parts of the continent. And though the army, upon
examina|tion of the numbers from the returns here, and the reinforcements
de&s;igned, &s;hould appear adequate, it is humbly &s;ubmitted, as a &s;ecurity
again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of its remaining inactive, whether it might not
be expedient to entru&s;t the latitude of embarking the army by &s;ea to the
commander in chief, provided any accidents du|ring the winter, and unknown
here, &s;hould have dimini&s;hed the numbers con&s;ider|ably, or that the
enemy, from any winter &s;ucce&s;s to the &s;outhward, &s;hould have been able
to draw &s;uch forces towards the frontiers of Canada, and take up their ground
with &s;uch precaution, as to render the intended mea&s;ure impracticable or
too ha|zardous. But in that ca&s;e it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that more force
would be required to be left behind for the &s;ecurity of Canada, than is
&s;uppo&s;ed to be nece&s;&s;ary when an army is beyond the lakes; and I do not
conceive any expedition from the &s;ea can be &s;o formidable to the enemy, or
&s;o effectual to clo&s;e the war, as an inva&s;ion from Canada by Ticonderoga.
This la&s;t mea&s;ure ought not to be thought of, but upon po&s;itive
conviction of its nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">No. IV.</NOTE>Extract of a Letter from Lord
<HI>George Germain</HI> to General <HI>Carleton,</HI> dated <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
26th <HI>March,</HI> 1777.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<P>MY letter of the 22d Augu&s;t, 1776, was intru&s;ted to the care
of Captain Le Maitre, one of your aid-de-camps; after having been three times
in the Gulph of St. Lawrence he had the mortification to find it impo&s;&s;ible
to make his pa&s;&s;age to Quebec, and therefore returned to England with my
di&s;patch; which, though it was prevented by that accident from reaching your
hands in due time, I neverthele&s;s think proper to tran&s;mit to you by this
earlie&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>You will be informed, by the contents thereof, that as &s;oon as
you &s;hould have driven the rebel forces from the frontiers of Canada, it was
his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure that you &s;hould return to Quebec, and take with
you &s;uch part of your army as in your judgment and di&s;cretion appeared
&s;ufficient for the defence of the province; that you &s;hould detach
Lieutenant General Burgoyne, or &s;uch other officer as you &s;hould think
mo&s;t proper, with the remainder of the troops, and direct the officer &s;o
detached to proceed with all po&s;&s;ible expedition to join General Howe, and
to put him&s;elf under his command.</P>
<P>With a view of quelling the rebellion as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible,
it is become highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary that the mo&s;t &s;peedy junction of the two
armies &s;hould be effected; and therefore, as the &s;ecurity and good
government of Canada ab&s;olutely require your pre&s;ence there, it is the
King's determination to leave about 3000 men under your command, for the
defence and duties of that province, and to employ the remainder of your army
upon two expeditions, the one under the command of Lieutenant Ge|neral
Burgoyne, who is to force his way to Albany, and the other under the com|mand
of Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger, who is to make a diver&s;ion on the Mohawk
River.</P>
<P>As this plan cannot be advantageou&s;ly executed without the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Cana|dians and Indians, his Maje&s;ty &s;trongly recommends
it to your care, to furni&s;h both <PB N="viii" REF="154"> expeditions with
good and &s;ufficient bodies of tho&s;e men; and I am happy in know|ing that
your influence among them is &s;o great, that there can be no room to
ap|prehend you will find it difficult to fulfil his Maje&s;ty's
expectations.</P>
<P>In order that no time may be lo&s;t in entering upon the&s;e
important undertakings, General Burgoyne has received orders to &s;ail
forthwith for Quebec; and that the in|tended operations may be maturely
con&s;idered, and afterwards carried on in &s;uch a manner as is mo&s;t likely
to be followed by &s;ucce&s;s, he is directed to con&s;ult with you upon the
&s;ubject, and to form and adju&s;t the plan as you both &s;hall think mo&s;t
con|ducive to his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o to acquaint you, that as &s;oon as you &s;hall have
fully regulated every thing relative to the&s;e expeditions (and the King
relies upon your zeal, that you will be as expeditious as the nature of the
bu&s;ine&s;s will admit) it is his Maje&s;ty's plea|&s;ure that you detain for
the Canada &s;ervice

<P>You will naturally conclude that this allotment for Canada has
not been made without properly weighing the &s;everal duties which are likely
to be required. His Maje&s;ty has not only con&s;idered the &s;everal
garri&s;ons and po&s;ts which probably it may be nece&s;&s;ary for you to take,
<HI>viz.</HI> Quebec, Chaudi&eacute;re, the di&s;affected pari&s;hes of Point
Levi, Montreal, and po&s;ts between that town and O&s;wegatche, Trois Rivieres,
St. John's, Sele aux Noix, La Prairie, Vergere, and &s;ome other towns upon the
&s;outh &s;hore of St. Lawrence, oppo&s;ite the i&s;le of Montreal, with
po&s;ts of communi|cation to St. John's, but he hath al&s;o reflected that the
&s;everal operations which will be carrying on in different parts of America
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily confine the attention of the rebels to the re&s;pective
&s;cenes of action, and &s;ecure Canada from external at|tacks, and that the
internal quiet which at pre&s;ent prevails is not likely to be in|terrupted, or
if interrupted, will &s;oon be re&s;tored by your influence over the
inha|bitants; he therefore tru&s;ts that 3000 men will be quite &s;ufficient to
an&s;wer every po&s;&s;ible demand.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure that you put under

to give him orders to pa&s;s Lake Champlain, and from thence, by the mo&s;t

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the opportunity of a ve&s;&s;el di&s;patched by Sir Guy
Carleton to England, to inform your Lord&s;hip of my arrival here the 6th
in&s;tant. And though my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, as acting under a &s;uperior
upon the &s;pot, may make an official corre&s;pon|dence unnece&s;&s;ary, I
cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf I &s;hall not appear guilty of impropriety in
a&s;&s;uming the honour of a private and confidential one, relatively to the
objects of my de&s;tination.</P>
<P>From my pre&s;ent information, I have rea&s;on to expect the
preparations for open|ing the campaign to be very forward on our part. Due
exertions were u&s;ed in the cour&s;e of the winter, and the uncommon
mildne&s;s of the weather greatly favoured them, to convey provi&s;ions to
Chambl&eacute; and St. John's. One large victualler ar|rived after I left the
St. Lawrence la&s;t November; all re&s;idues of other victuallers have been
collected; I am in hopes of finding a &s;ufficiency of provi&s;ion to enable me
to cro&s;s the Lake Champlain at lea&s;t, without the arrival of the Corke
fleet. I hope al&s;o to find artillery &s;tores enough to feel the pul&s;e of
the enemy at Ticondero|ga. Should their &s;ituation and re&s;olution be &s;uch
as to make great artillery prepa|rations requi&s;ite. I &s;hall certainly be
under the nece&s;&s;ity of waiting at Crown Point the arrival of the ordnance
&s;hips from England. A good body of the Indians I am a&s;&s;ured are ready to
move upon the fir&s;t call, and mea&s;ures are taking for bringing them
forthwith to proper redezvous.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;peak with &s;o much confidence of the military
a&s;&s;i&s;tance I am to look for from the Canadians. The only corps yet
in&s;tituted, or that I am informed can at pre&s;ent be in&s;tituted, are three
independent companies of 100 men each, officered by Seigneurs of the country,
who are well cho&s;en; but they have not been able to engage many volunteers.
The men are chiefly drafted from the militia, according to a late regulation of
the legi&s;lative council. Tho&s;e I have yet &s;een afford no pro|mi&s;e of
u&s;e of arms&mdash;aukwark, ignorant, di&s;inclined to the &s;ervice, and
&s;piritle&s;s. Various rea&s;ons are a&s;&s;igned for this change in the
natives &s;ince the time of the French government. It may partly be owing to a
di&s;u&s;e of arms, but I believe principally to the unpopularity of their
Seigneurs, and to the poi&s;on which the emi&s;&s;aries of the rebels have
thrown into their minds. Should I find the new com|panies up the country better
compo&s;ed, or that the well affected parties can be pre|vailed upon to turn
out volunteers, though but for a &s;hort occa&s;ion, as they did la&s;t year, I
&s;hall move Sir Guy to exert further mea&s;ures to augment my numbers.</P>
<P>The army will fall &s;hort of the &s;trength computed in
England; the want of the camp equipage, cloathing, and many other nece&s;&s;ary
articles, will cau&s;e inconve|nience; I am neverthele&s;s determined to put
the troops de&s;tined for my command immediately in motion; and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted
by the &s;pirit and health in which they abound, I am confident in the
pro&s;pect of overcoming difficulties and di&s;appoint|ments.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled all mea&s;ures with Sir Guy Carleton, both
for this purpo&s;e and for the expeditious tran&s;port of the &s;tores as they
may arrive, and having already di&s;|patched in&s;tructions to Captain
Lutwidge, who commands the fleet upon Lake <PB N="xi" REF="157"> Champlain, to
&s;ecure the navigation, in which I clearly &s;ee he will find no trouble, I
&s;hall proceed in per&s;on this afternoon for Montreal, and from thence make
my final arrangements for pur&s;uing the King's orders.</P>
<P>I &s;hould think my&s;elf deficient in ju&s;tice and in
honour, were I clo&s;e my letter without mentioning the &s;en&s;e I entertain
of General Carleton's conduct; that he was anxiou&s;ly de&s;irous of leading
the military operations out of the province, is ea&s;i|ly to be di&s;cerned;
but his deference to his Maje&s;ty's deci&s;ion, and his zeal to give effect to
his mea&s;ures in my hands, are equally manife&s;t, exemplary, and
&s;atisfactory. I &s;hall take every po&s;&s;ible means to tran&s;mit to your
Lord&s;hip an account of my pro|ceedings from time to time, and have the honour
to be, with perfect re&s;pect,</P>
<CLOSER>

&s;ervant, J. BURGOYNE.</SIGNED> <POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. I have mentioned nothing of intelligence concerning
the enemy, con|cluding that Sir Guy Carleton will tran&s;mit the material part
of it, and in a manner more full than in my power to do. I under&s;tand they
have laboured hard to &s;trengthen Ticonderoga, and threaten a vigorous
re&s;i&s;tance there, and that they have built &s;ome ve&s;&s;els on Lake
George, as your Lord&s;hip may remember I had fore&s;een.</P>

<P>I HAD the honour to write to your Lord&s;hip the day I left
Quebec, having rea|&s;on to imagine this letter may reach that place in time to
be di&s;patched with my former one, I cannot omit the occa&s;ion to inform your
Lord&s;hip, that the hopes I expre&s;&s;ed of being able to put the troops in
motion without waiting the arrival of the fleets from England and Ireland, are
confirmed.</P>
<P>The only delay is occa&s;ioned by the impracticability of the
roads, owing to late extraordinary heavy rains, and this difficulty will be
&s;peedily removed, by exerting the &s;ervices of the pari&s;hes as &s;oon as
the weather clears. In the mean time, I am employing every means that water
carriage will admit for drawing the troops and &s;tores towards their point. I
tru&s;t, I &s;hall have ve&s;&s;els &s;ufficient to move the army and &s;tores
together, and in that ca&s;e, will take po&s;t at once, within &s;ight of
Ticon|deroga, and only make u&s;e of Crown Point for my ho&s;pital and
magazine.</P>
<P>A continuation of intelligence from different &s;pies and
de&s;erters, confirms the de|&s;ign of the enemy to di&s;pute Ticonderoga
vigorou&s;ly. They are al&s;o building bow|gallies at Fort George, for the
defence of that Lake, &amp;c. fortifying on the road to Skene&s;borough.</P>
<P>It is con&s;igned to the New England colonies, to furni&s;h
&s;upplies of men and pro|vi&s;ion to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of my army, and
they have undertaken the ta&s;k, upon condition of being exempt from
&s;upplying Mr. Wa&s;hington's main army.</P>
<P>It is my de&s;ign, while advancing to Ticonderago, and during
the &s;iege of that po&s;t, for a &s;iege I apprehend it mu&s;t be, to give all
po&s;&s;ible jealou&s;y on the &s;ide of Connecticut. If I can by manoeuvre
lead the enemy to &s;u&s;pect, that after the reduc|tion of Ticonderago, my
views are pointed that way, the Connecticut forces will be 
<PB N="xii" REF="158"> very cautious of leaving their own frontier, and I may
gain a &s;tart that may much expedite and facilitate my progre&s;s to

<P>Your Lord&s;hip may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that, whatever

<OPENER><SALUTE>CHIEFS and WARRIORS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE great King, our common father, and the patron of all who
&s;eek and de&s;erve his protection, has con&s;idered with &s;atisfaction the
general conduct of the Indian tribes from the beginning of the troubles in
America. Too &s;agacious and too faithful to be deluded or corrupted, they have
ob&s;erved the violated rights of the parental power they love, and burned to
vindicate them. A few individuals alone, the refu&s;e of a &s;mall tribe, at
the fir&s;t were led a&s;tray, and the mi&s;repre&s;entations, the &s;pecious
al|lurements, the in&s;idious promi&s;es and diver&s;ified plots, in which the
rebels are exer|ci&s;ed, and all of which they employed for that effect, have
&s;erved only in the end to enhance the honour of the tribes in general, by
demon&s;trating to the world, how few and how contemptible are the apo&s;tates.
It is a truth known to you all, that the&s;e pitiful examples excepted, and
they probably have before this day hid their faces in &s;hame, the collective
voices and hands of the Indian tribes over this va&s;t con|tinent, are on the
&s;ide of ju&s;tice, of law, and of the King.</P>
<P>The re&s;traint you have put upon your re&s;entment in waiting
the King your father's call to arms, the harde&s;t proof, I am per&s;uaded, to
which your affection could have been put, is another manife&s;t and affected
mark of your adherence to that principle of connection to which you were always
fond to allude, and which it is mutually the joy and the duty of the parent to
cheri&s;h.</P>
<P>The clemency of your father has been abu&s;ed, the offers of
his mercy have been de&s;pi&s;ed, and his farther patience would, in his eyes,
become culpable, in as much as it would withold redre&s;s from the mo&s;t
grievous oppre&s;&s;ions in the provinces thatever di&s;|graced the hi&s;tory
of mankind. It therefore remains for me, the General of one of his Maje&s;ty's
armies, and in this council his repre&s;entative, to relea&s;e you from tho&s;e
bonds which your obedience impo&s;ed.&mdash;Warriors, you are free&mdash;Go
forth in might of your valour and your cau&s;e; &s;trike at the common enemies
of Great-Britain and America&mdash;di&s;turbers of public order, peace, and
happine&s;s&mdash;de&s;troyers of commerce, parricides of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The circle round you, the chiefs of his Maje&s;ty's European
forces, and of the Princes his allies, e&s;teem you as brothers in the war;
emulous in glory and in friend|&s;hip, we will endeavour reciprocally to give
and to receive examples; we know how to value, and we will &s;trive to imitate
your per&s;everance in enterprize, and your con&s;tancy to re&s;i&s;t hunger,
wearine&s;s, and pain. Be it our ta&s;k, from the dictates of 
<PB N="xiii" REF="159"> our religion, the laws of our warefare, and the
principles and intere&s;t of our policy, to regulate your pa&s;&s;ions when
they overbear, to point out were it is nobler to &s;pare than to revenge, to
di&s;criminate degrees of guilt, to &s;u&s;pend the up-li&s;ted &s;troke, to
cha&s;ti&s;e, and not to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>This war to you, my friends, is new; upon all former
occa&s;ions in taking the field you held your&s;elves authorized to de&s;troy
wherever you came, becau&s;e every where you found an enemy. The ca&s;e is now
very different.</P>
<P>The King has many faithful &s;ubjects di&s;per&s;ed in the
provinces, con&s;equently you have many brothers there; and the&s;e people are
the more to be pitied, that they are per&s;ecuted, or impri&s;oned, wherever
they are di&s;covered, or &s;u&s;pected, and to di|&s;emble, is, to a generous
mind, a yet more grievous puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Per&s;uaded that your magnanimity of character, joined to your
principles of affec|tion to the King, will give me fuller controul over your
minds, than the military rank with which I am inve&s;ted, I enjoin your mo&s;t
&s;erious attention to the rules which I hereby proclaim for your invariable
ob&s;ervation during the campaign.</P>
<P>I po&s;itively forbid blood&s;hed, when you are not oppo&s;ed
in arms.</P>
<P>Aged men, women, children, and pri&s;oners, mu&s;t be held
&s;acred from the knife or hatchet, even in the time of actual conflict.</P>
<P>You &s;hall receive compen&s;ation for the pri&s;oners you
take, but you &s;hall be called to account for &s;calps.</P>
<P>In conformity and indulgence to your cu&s;toms, which have
affixed an idea of ho|nour to &s;uch badges of victory, you &s;hall be allowed
to take the &s;calps of the dead, when killed by your fire, and in fair
oppo&s;ition; but on no account, or pretence, or &s;ubtlety, or prevarication,
are they to be taken from the wounded, or even dying; and &s;till le&s;s
pardonable, if po&s;&s;ible, will it be held, to kill men in that condition, on
purpo&s;e, and upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that this protection to the wounded,
would be thereby evaded.</P>
<P>Ba&s;e lurking a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, incendiaries, ravagers, and
plunderers of the country, to whatever army they may belong, &s;hall be treated
with le&s;s re&s;erve; but the latitude mu&s;t be given you by order, and I
mu&s;t be the judge of the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Should the enemy, on their part, dare to countenance acts of
barbarity towards tho&s;e who may fall into their hands, it &s;hall be yours
al&s;o to retaliate; but till &s;everity &s;hall be thus compelled, bear
immoveable in your hearts this &s;olid maxim, it cannot be too deeply
impre&s;&s;ed, that the great e&s;&s;ential reward, worthy &s;ervice of your
alli|ance, the &s;incerity of your zeal to the King your father, and
never-failing protector, will be examined, and judged upon the te&s;t only of
your &s;teady and uniform adhe|rence to the orders and coun&s;els of tho&s;e to
whom his Maje&s;ty has intru&s;ted the direc|tion and the honour of his
arms.</P>

advanced corps, con&s;i&s;ting of the Briti&s;h light infantry and grenadiers,
the 24th regiment, &s;ome Canadians and Savages, and ten pieces of light
artillery, under the command of Brigadier General Fra&s;er, to move from Putnam
Creek, where they had been encamped &s;ome days, up the we&s;t &s;hore of the
lake to Four-Mile-Point, &s;o called from being within that di&s;tance off the
fort of Ticoderoga. The German re&s;erve, con&s;i&s;ting of the Brun&s;wick
cha&s;&s;eurs, light infantry and gre|nadiers under Lieutenant Colonel Breyman
were moved at the &s;ame time to Richard|&s;on's farm, on the ea&s;t &s;hore,
oppo&s;ite to Putnam Creek.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t July.</NOTE>The whole army made
a movement forward. Brigadier Fra&s;er's corps occupied the &s;trong po&s;t
called Three-Mile-Point, on the we&s;t &s;hore; the German re&s;erve the
ea&s;t-&s;hore oppo&s;ite: the army encamped in two lines, the right wing at
the Four-Mile-Point, the left wing nearly oppo&s;ite, on the ea&s;t
&s;hore.</P>
<P>The Royal George, and Inflexible frigates, with the
gun-boats, were anchored at this time ju&s;t without the reach of the enemy's
batteries, and covered the lake from the we&s;t to the ea&s;t &s;hores. The
re&s;t of the fleet had been &s;ome time without guns, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t
in carrying provi&s;ions over Lake Champlain.</P>
<P>The enemy appeared to be po&s;ted as follows. A brigade
occupied the old French lines on the height to the north of the fort of
Ticonderoga. The&s;e lines were in good repair, and had &s;everal intrenchments
behind them, chiefly calculated to guard the north-we&s;t flank, and were
further &s;u&s;tained by a block-hou&s;e. They had, farther to 
<PB N="xv" REF="161"> their left, a po&s;t at the &s;aw-mills, which are at the
foot of the carrying-place to Lake George, and a block-hou&s;e upon an eminence
above the mills, and a block-hou&s;e and ho&s;pital at the entrance of the
lake.</P>
<P>Upon the right of the lines, and between them and the
old fort, there were two new block-hou&s;es and a con&s;iderable battery
clo&s;e to the water edge.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed that the enemy had employed their chief
indu&s;try, and were in the grea|te&s;t force upon Mount Independence, which is
high and circular, and upon the &s;um|mit, which is Table Land, was a &s;tar
fort, made of pickets, and well &s;upplied with artillery, and a large &s;quare
of barracks within it. The foot of the hill, on the &s;ide which projects into
the lake, was intrenched and had a &s;trong abbattis clo&s;e to the water. This
intrenchment was lined with heavy artillery, pointed down the lake flanking the
water battery, above de&s;cribed, and &s;u&s;tained by another battery about
half way up the hill. On the we&s;t &s;ide the hill runs the main river, and in
its pa&s;&s;age is joined by the water which comes down from Lake George. The
enemy had here a bridge of communication, which could not at this time be
reconnoitred. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the hill the water forms a &s;mall bay,
into which falls a rivulet after having encirculed in its cour&s;e part of the
hill to the &s;outh ea&s;t. The &s;ide to the &s;outh could not be &s;een, but
was de&s;cribed as inacce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">July 2.</NOTE>About nine in the
morning a &s;moke was ob&s;erved towards Lake George, and the Savages brought
in a report that the enemy had &s;et fire to the further block-hou&s;e and had
abandoned the &s;aw-mills, and that a con&s;iderable body were advancing from
the lines towards a bridge upon the road which led from the &s;aw-mills towards
the right of the Briti&s;h camp. A detachment of the advanced corps was
immediately put in march, under the command of Brigadier Fra&s;er, &s;upported
by the &s;econd brigade and &s;ome light artillery, under the command of Major
General Phillips, with orders to proceed to Mount Hope, which is to the north
of the lines, to reconnoitre the enemy's po&s;ition, and to take advantage of
any po&s;t they might abandon or be driven from. The Indians under Captain
Fra&s;er, &s;upported by his company of mark&s;men, were directed to make a
circuit to the left of Brigadier Fra&s;er's line of march, and endea|vour to
cut off the retreat of the enemy to their lines; but this de&s;ign mi&s;carried
through the impetuo&s;ity of the Indians, who attacked too &s;oon, and in
front; and the enemy were thereby able to retire with the lo&s;s of one officer
and a few men killed, and one officer wounded. Major General Phillips took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the very advanta|geous po&s;t of Mount Hope this night,
and the enemy were thereby entirely cut off from all communication with Lake
George.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">July 3.</NOTE>Mount Hope was occupied
in force by General Fra&s;er's whole corps. The fir&s;t Briti&s;h brigade, and
two entire brigades of artillery. The &s;econd brigade, Briti&s;h, encamped
upon the left of the fir&s;t, and the brigade of Gall, having been drawn from
the ea&s;t &s;hore to occupy the ground where Fra&s;er's corps had originally
been; the line became compleat, extending from Three-Mile-Point to the
we&s;termo&s;t part of Mount Hope; on the &s;ame day, Major General Reide&s;el
encamped on the ea&s;t &s;hore in a parallel line with Three-Mile-Point, having
pu&s;hed the re&s;erve forward near the rivulet which encircles Mount
Independence. The enemy cannonaded the camps of Mount Hope and of the German
re&s;erve during mo&s;t part of this day, but without effect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">July 4.</NOTE>The army worked hard at

the expediency of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it; but the idea was rejected, upon the
&s;uppo&s;ition that it was impo&s;&s;ible for a corps to be e&s;tabli&s;hed
there in force. Lieutenant Twi&s;s reported this hill to have the entire
command of the works and buildings both of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence,
at the d &s;tance of about 1400 yards from the former, and 1500 from the
latter; that the ground might be levelled &s;o as to receive cannon, and that
the road to convey them, though difficult, might be made practicable in
twenty-four hours. This hill al&s;o commanded, in rever&s;e, the bridge of
communication; &s;aw the exact &s;itu|ation of their ve&s;&s;els; nor could the
enemy, during the day, make any material movement or preparation, without being
di&s;covered, and even having their num|bers counted,</P>
<P>It was determined that a battery &s;hould be rai&s;ed on
Sugar Hill for light twenty|four pounders, medium twelves, and eight-inch
howitzers. This very arduous work was carried on &s;o rapidly that the battery
would have been ready the next day.</P>
<P>It is a duty in this place to do &s;ome ju&s;tice to the
zeal and activity of Major General Phillips, who had the direction of the
operation, and having mentioned that mo&s;t valuable officer, I tru&s;t it
cannot be thought a digre&s;&s;ion to add, that it is to his judicious
arrangements and indefatigable pains, during the general &s;uper|intendency of
preparation which Sir Guy Carleton entru&s;ted to him in the winter and
&s;pring, that the &s;ervice is indebted for its pre&s;ent forwardne&s;s. The
preva|lence of contrary winds and other accidents having rendered it
impo&s;&s;ible for any nece&s;&s;aries prepared in England for the opening of
the campaign, yet to reach the camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">6th July.</NOTE>Soon after day-light
an officer arrived expre&s;s, on board the Royal George, where in the night I
took up my quarters, as the mo&s;t centrical &s;ituation, with information from
Brigadier Fra&s;er that the enemy were retiring, and that he was advancing with
his picquets, leaving orders for the brigade to follow as &s;oon as they could
accoutre, with intention to pur&s;ue by land. This movement was very
di&s;cernible, as were the Briti&s;h colours, which the Brigadier had fixed
upon the fort of Ticonderoga. Knowing how &s;afely I could tru&s;t to that
officer's conduct. I turned my chief attention to the pur&s;uit by water, by
which route I under&s;tood one column were retiring in two hundred and twenty
bateaux, covered by five armed gallies.</P>
<P>The great bridge of communication, through which a way
was to be opened, was &s;upported by twenty-two &s;unken piers of large timber,
at nearly equal di|&s;tances; the &s;pace between were made of &s;eparate
floats, each about fifty feet long, and twelve feet wide, &s;trongly fa&s;tened
together by chains and rivets, and al&s;o fa&s;tened to the &s;unken piers.
Before this bridge was a boom, made of very <PB N="xvii" REF="163"> large
pieces of timber, fa&s;tened together by rivetted bolts and double chains, made
of iron an inch and an half &s;quare.</P>
<P>The gun-boats were in&s;tantly moved forward, and the
boom and one of the intermediate floats were cut with great dexterity and
di&s;patch, and Commodore Lutwidge, with the officers and &s;eamen in his
department, partaking the general animation, a pa&s;&s;age was formed in half
an hour for the frigates al&s;o, through im|pediments which the enemy had been
labouring to con&s;truct &s;ince la&s;t autumn.</P>
<P>During this operation Major General Reide&s;el had
pa&s;&s;ed to Mount Indepen|dence, with the corps, Breyman, and part of the
left wing. He was directed to proceed by land, to &s;u&s;tain Brigadier
Fra&s;er, or to act more to the left, if he &s;aw it expedient &s;o to do.</P>
<P>The 62d regiment Briti&s;h, and the Brun&s;wick regiment
of Prince Frederick, were &s;tationed at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, in
the place of the parties of Fra&s;er's brigade, which had been left in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the artillery and &s;tores, and the re&s;t of the army
was ordered to follow up the river as they could be col|lected, without regard
to the place in the line.</P>
<P>About three in the afternoon I arrived with the Royal
George and Inflexible; and the be&s;t &s;ailing gun-boats at South Bay, within
three miles of Skene&s;borough, at which latter place the enemy were po&s;ted
in a &s;tockaded fort, and their armed gallies in the falls below.</P>
<P>The foremo&s;t regiments, viz. the 9th, 20th, and
21&s;t, were immediately di&s;|embarked, and a&s;cended the mountains with the
intention of getting behind the fort, and cutting off the retreat of the enemy;
but their precipitate flight rendered this manoeuvre ineffectual. The gun-boats
and frigates continued their cour&s;e to Skene&s;borough Falls, where the armed
ve&s;&s;els were po&s;ted. Captain Carter, with part of his brigade of
gun-boats, immediately attacked, and with &s;o much &s;pirit, that two of the
ve&s;&s;els very &s;oon &s;truck; the other three were blown up, and the enemy
having previou&s;ly prepared combu&s;tible materials, &s;et fire to the fort,
mills, &s;torehou&s;es, bateaux, &amp;c. and retired with the detachment left
for that purpo&s;e, the main body having gone off when the troops were
a&s;cending the mountain. A great quantity of provi&s;ions and &s;ome arms were
here con&s;umed, and mo&s;t of their officers' baggage was burnt, &s;unk, or
taken. Their lo&s;s is not known; about 30 pri&s;oners were made, among which
were two wounded officers.</P>
<P>During the&s;e operations upon the right, Brigadier
General Fra&s;er continued his pur&s;uit to Ca&s;tletown till one o'clock,
having marched in a very hot day from four o'clock in the morning till that
time. Some &s;tragglers of the enemy were picked up, from whom the Brigadier
learned that their rear guard was compo&s;ed of cho&s;en men, and commanded by
Colonel Francis, one of their be&s;t officers. During the time that the men
were refre&s;hing, Major General Reide&s;el came up, and arrange|ments for
continuing the pur&s;uit having been concerted, Brigadier Fra&s;er moved
forward again, and during the night lay upon his arms, in an advantageous
&s;itu|ation, three miles nearer the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">7th July.</NOTE>At three in the
morning he renewed his march, and about five his advanced &s;couts di&s;covered
the enemy's centries, who fired their pieces and joined the main body. The
Brigadier ob&s;erving a commanding ground to the left of his light infantry,
immediately ordered it to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that corps; and a
con&s;iderable body of the enemy attempting the &s;ame, they met. The enemy
were driven back <PB N="xviii" REF="164"> to their original po&s;t; the
advanced guard under Major Grant was by this time engaged, and the grenadiers
were advanced to &s;u&s;tain them, and to prevent the right flank from being
turned. The Brigadier remained on the left, where the enemy long defended
them&s;elves by the aid of logs and trees, and after being repul&s;ed, and
prevented getting to the Ca&s;tletown road by the grenadiers, they rallied, and
renewed the action; and upon a &s;econd repul&s;e, attempted their retreat by
Pitsford Mountain. The grenadiers &s;crambled up a part of that a&s;cent,
appearing almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, and gained the &s;ummit before them, which
threw them into confu&s;ion; they were &s;till greatly &s;uperior in numbers,
and con&s;equently in extent, and the brigadier, in momentary expectation of
the Brun&s;wickers, had latterally drawn from his left to &s;upport his right.
At this critical moment General Reide&s;el, who had pre&s;&s;ed on, upon
hearing the firing, arrived with the foremo&s;t of his columns, viz. the
cha&s;&s;eurs company and eighty grenadiers and light infantry. His judgment
immediately pointed to him the cour&s;e to take; he extended upon Brigadier
Fra&s;er's left flank. The cha&s;&s;eurs got into action with great gallantry,
under Major Barner. They fled on all &s;ides, leaving dead upon the field
Colonel Francis and many other officers, with upwards of 200 men; above 600
were wounded, mo&s;t of whom peri&s;hed in the woods, attempting to get off,
and one colonel, &s;even captains, ten &s;ubalterns, and 210 men were made
pri&s;oners; above 200 &s;tand of arms were al&s;o taken.</P>
<P>The number of the enemy before the engagement amounted
to 2000 men. The Briti&s;h detachment under Brigadier General Fra&s;er (the
parties left the day before at Ticonderoga not having been able to join)
con&s;i&s;ted only of 850 fighting men.</P>
<P>The bare relation of &s;o &s;ignal an action is
&s;ufficient for its prai&s;e. Should the attack again&s;t &s;uch inequality of
numbers, before the German brigade came up, &s;eem to require explanation, it
is to be con&s;idered that the enemy might have e&s;caped by delay; that the
advanced guard on a &s;udden found them&s;elves too near the enemy to avoid
action without retreating; and that Brigadier Fra&s;er had &s;uppo&s;ed the
German troops to be very near. The difference of time in their arrival was
merely accidental. The Germans pu&s;hed for a &s;hare in the glory, and they
arrived in time to obtain it. I have only to add, that the exertions of
Briga|dier Fra&s;er on this day were but a continuance of that uniform
intelligence, activity and bravery, which di&s;tingui&s;h his character upon
all occa&s;ions, and entitle him to be recommended, in the mo&s;t particular
manner, to his Maje&s;ty's favour.</P>
<P>The officers and &s;oldiers of this brigade have
prevented any di&s;tinctions of indi|viduals by a general and equal di&s;play
of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The country people about Skene&s;borough having reported
that part of the enemy were &s;till retreating, the 9th regiment was detached,
with orders to take po&s;t near Fort Anne, and ob&s;erve the enemy's motions.
This was effected, but with great difficulty, as the roads were almo&s;t
impracticable, and the bridges broken. The other troops were employed all that
day and night in dragging fifty bateaux over the carrying place at Wood Creek,
to facilitate the movement of the re&s;t of the fir&s;t brigade to Fort Anne,
to di&s;lodge the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8th July.</NOTE>A report was received
from Lieutenant Colonel Hill (9th regiment) that the enemy had been reinforced
in the night by a con&s;iderable body of fre&s;h men; that he could not retire
with his regiment before them, but he would maintain his ground. The two
remaining regiments of the fir&s;t brigade were ordered to quicken 
<PB N="xix" REF="165"> their march, and upon &s;econd intelligence of the
enemy, and firing being heard, the 20th regiment was ordered forward with two
pieces of artillery, and Major General Phillips was &s;ent to take the command.
A violent &s;torm of rain, which la&s;ted the whole day, prevented the troops
from getting to Fort Anne &s;o &s;oon as was intended; but the delay gave the
9th regiment an opportunity of di&s;tingui&s;h|ing them&s;elves, by &s;tanding
and repul&s;ing an attack of &s;ix times their number. The enemy finding the
po&s;ition not to be forced in front, endeavoured to turn it; and from the
&s;uperiority of their numbers that inconvenience was to be appre|hended; and
Lieutenant Colonel Hill found it nece&s;&s;ary to change his po&s;ition in the
height of action: &s;o critical an order was executed by the regiment with the
utmo&s;t &s;teadine&s;s and bravery. The enemy, after an attack of three hours,
were totally repul&s;ed, and fled towards Fort Edward, &s;etting fire to Fort
Anne, but leaving a &s;aw-mill and a block-hou&s;e in good repair, which were
afterwards po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the king's troops.</P>
<P>The 9th regiment acquired, during their expedition,
about thirty pri&s;oners, &s;ome &s;tores and baggage, and colours of the 2d
Hamp&s;hire regiment.</P>
<P>One unlucky accident happened, to counterbalance, in
&s;ome degree, this &s;uc|ce&s;s. Captain Montgomery, an officer of great
merit, was wounded early in the action, and was in the act of being dre&s;&s;ed
by the &s;urgeon when the regiment changed ground; being unable to help
him&s;elf, he and the &s;urgeon were taken pri&s;oners. I &s;ince hear he has
been well treated, and is in a fair way of recovery at Albany.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9th and 10th July.</NOTE>The army
very much fatigued (many parts of it having wanted their provi&s;ions for two
days, almo&s;t the whole their tents and baggage) a&s;&s;embled in their
pre&s;ent po&s;ition. The right wing occupies the heights of Skene&s;borough in
two lines; the right flank to the mountains, covered by the regiment of
Reide&s;el's dragoons, <HI>en potence;</HI> the left to the Wood Creek.</P>
<P>The Brun&s;wick troops under Major General Reide&s;el
upon Ca&s;tletown River, with Breyman's corps upon the communication of roads
leading to Putney and Rutland; the regiment of He&s;&s;e Hanau are po&s;ted at
the head of Ea&s;t Creek, to pre&s;erve the communication with the camp at
Ca&s;tletown River, and &s;ecure the bateaux.</P>
<P>Brigadier Fra&s;er's corps is in the centre, ready to
move on either wing of the army.</P>
<P>The &s;cattered remains of the enemy are at Fort Edward,
on the Hud&s;on's River, where they have been joined, as I am informed, by
General Putnam, with a con&s;iderable corps of fre&s;h troops.</P>
<P>Roads are opening for the army to march to them by Fort
Anne, and the Wood Creek is clearing of fallen trees, &s;unken &s;tones, and
other ob&s;tacles, to give pa&s;&s;age to bateaux for carrying artillery,
&s;tores, provi&s;ions and camp equipage. The&s;e are laborious works; but the
&s;pirit and zeal of the troops are &s;ufficient to &s;urmount them. Some
little time mu&s;t al&s;o be allowed for the &s;upplies of provi&s;ions to
overtake us. In the mean time all po&s;&s;ible diligence is u&s;ing at
Ticonderoga to get the gun-boats, provi&s;ion ve&s;&s;els, and a proper
quantity of bateaux into Lake George. A corps of the army will be ordered to
penetrate by that route, which will afterwards be the route for the magazines;
and a junction of the whole is in|tended at Fort Edward.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>[Private.]</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING given your Lord&s;hip a detail, in my public letter of
this date, of the late tran&s;actions, I now do my&s;elf the honour to &s;tate
to your Lord&s;hip, &s;uch circum|&s;tances as appear to me more proper for a
private communication.</P>
<P>Mr. Peters and Mr. Je&s;&s;up, who came over to Canada la&s;t
autumn, and propo&s;ed to rai&s;e battalions, one from the neighbourhood of
Albany, the other from Charlotte county, are confident of &s;ucce&s;s as the
army advances. Their battalions are now in embryo, but very promi&s;ing; they
have fought, and with &s;pirit. Sir Guy Carleton has given me blank
commi&s;&s;ions for the officers, to fill up occa&s;ionally, and the agree|ment
with them is, that the commi&s;&s;ions are not to be &s;o effective, till two
thirds of the battalions are rai&s;ed. Some hundreds of men, a third part of
them with arms, have joined me &s;ince I have penerated this place,
profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves loyali&s;ts, and wi&s;hing to &s;erve, &s;ome to
the end of the war, &s;ome for the campaign. Though I am without in&s;tructions
upon this &s;ubject, I have not he&s;itated to receive them, and as fa&s;t as
companies can be formed, I &s;hall po&s;t the officers till a deci&s;ion can be
made upon the mea&s;ure by my &s;uperiors. I mean to employ them particularly
upon detach|ments, for keeping the country in awe, and procuring cattle; their
real u&s;e I expect will be great in the pre&s;ervation of the national troops:
but the impre&s;&s;ion which will be cau&s;ed upon public opinion, &s;hould
provincials be &s;een acting vigorou&s;ly in the cau&s;e of the King, will be
yet more advantageous, and, I tru&s;t, fully ju&s;tify the ex|pence.</P>
<P>The manife&s;to, of which I enclo&s;ed your Lord&s;hip a copy
in my la&s;t di&s;patches, and herewith &s;end a duplicate, has great effect
where the country is not in the power of the rebels; where it is, the
committees turn all their efforts to counteract it. They watch or impri&s;on
all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, compel the people in general to take arms, and to
drive the cattle, and to burn the corn, under penalty of immediate death. Great
numbers have been hanged. Should the&s;e wretches &s;ucceed to make a de&s;ert
of the country, by fire and ma&s;&s;acre, it will at lea&s;t be a plea&s;ing
reflection, that while advantages are reaped from the clement part of the
manife&s;to, they, and not the King's troops, are the executioners of its
threats.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip will have ob&s;erved, I have made no mention
of the Indians, in the pur&s;uit from Ticonderoga. It is not po&s;&s;ible to
draw them in many re&s;pects from the plunder of that place, and I
confidentially acknowledge this is not the only in&s;tance in which I have
found little more than a name. If, under the management of their conductors,
they are indulged, for intere&s;ted rea&s;ons, in all the caprices and humours
of &s;poiled children, like them they grow more unrea&s;onable and importunate
upon <PB N="xxi" REF="167"> every new favour; were they left to them&s;elves,
enormities too horrid to think of would en&s;ue, guilty and innocent, women and
infants, would be a common prey.</P>
<P>This is the character of the lower Canadian Indians, who alone
have been with the army hitherto. I am informed the Outawas, and other remote
nations, who are within two days march of joining me, are more brave and more
tractable; that they profe&s;s war, not pillage. They are under the directions
of a M. St. Luc, a Canadian gentleman of honour and parts, and one of the
be&s;t partizans the French had la&s;t war, and of one Langlade, the very man
who projected and executed with the&s;e very na|tions the defeat of General
Braddock. My fir&s;t intention was to turn this whole corps to the Connecticut
immediately, to force a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, to intercept reinforcements,
and to confirm the jealou&s;y I have in many ways endeavoured to ex|cite in the
New England provinces; but finding that the enemy are labouring to re|move
their magazines from Forts George and Edward, and every where de&s;troying the
roads, and preparing to drive and burn the country towards Albany, I have
de|termined to employ them, to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, by their terror, the
continuance of tho&s;e operations. And after arriving at Albany, they may be
employed to renew the alarm towards Connecticut and Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip will pardon me if I a little lament that my
orders do not give me the latitude I ventured to propo&s;e in my original
project for the campaign, to make a real effort in&s;tead of a feint upon New
England. As things have turned out, were I at liberty to march in force
immediately by my left, in&s;tead of my right, I &s;hould have little doubt of
&s;ubduing before winter the provinces where the rebellion origi|ginated.</P>
<P>If my late letters reach Mr. Howe, I &s;till hope this plan
may be adopted from Al|bany; in the mean while my utmo&s;t exertions &s;hall
continue, according to my in|&s;tructions, to force a junction.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent &s;ome Indians through the woods, in the hope of
their reaching St. Leger, with the account of my progre&s;s; now is the
critical time for his pu&s;h upon the Mohawk. I have certain intelligence that
all the country round Fort Stanwix is in alarm: but I imagine it proceeds from
the appearance of &s;ome Savages detached by Colonel Butler, not apprehending
St. Leger can be got quite &s;o forward.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE> Camp near Saratoga, 
<DATE>Augu&s;t 20, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t di&s;patch (a duplicate of which will be
inclo&s;ed herewith) I had the honour to inform your Lord&s;hip of the
proceedings of the army under my command to the 30th of July.</P>
<P>From that period to the 15th of Augu&s;t every po&s;&s;ible
mea&s;ure was employed to bring forward bateaux, provi&s;ions, and ammunition
from Fort George to the fir&s;t navigable part of Hud&s;on's River, a
di&s;tance of eighteen miles, the roads in &s;ome parts &s;teep, and in others
wanting great repair. Of the hor&s;es furni&s;hed by contra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t in Canada not more than a third part
was yet arrived. The delay was not imputable <PB N="xxii" REF="168"> to
neglect, but to the natural accidents attending &s;o long and intricate a
combination of land and water carriage. Fifty team of oxen, which had been
collected in the country through which I had marched, were added to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the tran&s;port; but the&s;e re&s;ources together were found far
inadequate to the purpo&s;es of feeding the army, and forming a magazine at the
&s;ame time. Exceeding heavy rains augmented the impediments. It was often
nece&s;&s;ary to employ ten or twelve oxen upon a &s;ingle bateau; and after
the utmo&s;t exertions for the fifteen days above &s;tated, there were not
above four days provi&s;ion before hand, nor above ten bateaux in the
river.</P>
<P>Intelligence had reached me that Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger
was before Fort Stanwix, which was defended. The main army of the enemy
oppo&s;ed to me was at Stillwater, a place between Saratoga and the mouth of
the Mohawk.</P>
<P>A rapid movement forward appeared to be of the utmo&s;t
con&s;equence at this period. The enemy could not have proceeded up the Mohawk
without putting them&s;elves between two fires, in ca&s;e Colonel St. Leger
&s;hould have &s;ucceeded; and at be&s;t being cut off by my army from Albany.
They mu&s;t either therefore have &s;tood an action, have fallen back towards
Albany, or have pa&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on's River, in order to &s;ecure a retreat
to New England, higher up. Which ever of the&s;e mea&s;ures they had taken,
&s;o that the King's army had been enabled to advance, Colo|nel St. Leger's
operations would have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted, a junction with him probably
&s;ecured, and the whole country of the Mohawk opened. To maintain the
commu|nication with Fort George during &s;uch a movement, &s;o as to be
&s;upplied by daily degrees at a di&s;tance, continually increa&s;ing, was an
obvious impo&s;&s;ibility. The army was much too weak to have afforded a chain
of po&s;ts. E&s;corts for every &s;epa|rate tran&s;port would have been a
&s;till greater drain; nor could any have been made &s;o &s;trong as to force
their way through &s;uch po&s;itions as the enemy might take in one night's
march from the White Creek, where they had a numerous militia. Had the enemy
remained &s;upine, through fear or want of comprehending &s;o palpable an
ad|vantage, the phy&s;ical impo&s;&s;ibility of being &s;upplied by degrees
from Fort George was &s;till in force, becau&s;e a new nece&s;&s;ity of land
carriage for nine miles ari&s;es at Still|water; and in the proportion that
carriages had been brought forward to that place, the tran&s;port mu&s;t have
cea&s;ed behind.</P>
<P>The alternative therefore was &s;hort; either to relinqui&s;h
the favourable opportuni|ty of advancing upon the enemy, or to attempt other
re&s;ources of &s;upply.</P>
<P>It was well known that the enemy's &s;upplies in live cattle,
from a large tract of country, pa&s;&s;ed by the route of Manche&s;ter,
Arlington, and other parts of the Hamp&s;hire Grants, to Bennington, in order
to be occa&s;ionally conveyed from thence to the main army. A large depo&s;it
of corn and of wheel carriages was al&s;o formed at the &s;ame place, and the
u&s;ual guard was militia, though it varied in numbers from day to day. A
&s;cheme was formed to &s;urpri&s;e Bennington. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
cattle and carriages would certainly have enabled the army to leave their
di&s;tant ma|gazines, and to have acted with energy and di&s;patch: &s;ucce&s;s
would al&s;o have an&s;wer|ed many &s;econdary purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Lieut. Col. Baume, an officer well qualified for the
undertaking, was fixed upon to command. He had under him 200 di&s;mounted
dragoons of the regiment of Riede|&s;el, Captain Fra&s;er's mark&s;men, which
were the only Briti&s;h, all the Canadian volun|teers, a party of the
Provincials who perfectly knew the country, 100 Indians, and two light pieces
of cannon; the whole detachment amounted to abo ut 500 men. The in&s;tructions
were po&s;itive to keep the regular corps po&s;ted while thel ight troops felt 
<PB N="xxiii" REF="169"> their way, and not to incur the danger of being
&s;urrounded, or having a retreat cut off.</P>
<P>In order to facilitate this operation, and to be ready to take
advantage of its &s;uc|ce&s;s, the army moved up the ea&s;t &s;hore of
Hud&s;on's River. On the 14th, a bridge was formed of rafts, over which the
advanced corps pa&s;&s;ed and encamped at Saratoga. Lieutenant Colonel
Breyman's corps were po&s;ted near Batten Kill, and upon intelli|gence from
Colonel Baume, that the enemy were &s;tronger at Bennington than ex|pected, and
were aware of his attack, that corps, con&s;i&s;ting of the Brun&s;wick
gre|nadiers, light infantry and cha&s;&s;eurs, were &s;ent forward to
&s;u&s;tain him.</P>
<P>It &s;ince appears that Lieutenant Colonel Baume, not having
been able to complete his march undi&s;covered, was joined at a place called
Sancoix Mills, about four miles &s;hort of Bennington, by many people
profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be Loyali&s;ts. A pro|vincial gentleman of
confidence who had been &s;ent with the detachment, as knowing the country and
the character of the inhabitants, was &s;o incautious as to leave at liber|ty
&s;uch as took the oath of allegiance.</P>
<P>His credulity and their profligacy cau&s;ed the fir&s;t
misfortune. Colonel Baume was induced to proceed without &s;ufficient knowledge
of the ground. His de&s;ign was be|trayed; the men who had taken the oaths were
the fir&s;t to fire upon him; he was attacked on all &s;ides. He &s;hewed great
per&s;onal courage, but was overpowered by numbers.</P>
<P>During this time Lieutenant Colonel Breyman was upon the march
through a hea|vy rain; and &s;uch were the other impediments &s;tated in that
officer's report, of bad roads, tired hor&s;es, difficulties in pa&s;&s;ing
artillery, carriages, &amp;c. that he was from eight in the morning of the 15th
to four in the afternoon of the following day making about twenty-four
miles.</P>
<P>He engaged, fought gallantly, and drove the enemy from three
&s;everal heights; but was too late to &s;uccour Colonel Baume, who was made
pri&s;oner, and a con&s;idera|ble part of his dragoons were killed or taken.
The failure of ammunition, from the accidental breaking to pieces of a tumbril,
unfortunately obliged Lieutenant Colonel Breyman to retire conquering troops,
and to leave behind two pieces of cannon, be|&s;ides two which had been lo&s;t
by Lieutenant Colonel Baume. The Indians made good their retreat from the
fir&s;t affair, as did Captain Fra&s;er, with part of his compa|ny, and many of
the Provincials and Canadians.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s, as at pre&s;ent appears, amounts to about 400 men,
killed and taken in both actions, and twenty-&s;ix officers, mo&s;tly
pri&s;oners; but men who were di&s;per&s;ed in the woods drop in daily. A
correct return &s;hall be tran&s;mitted to your Lord&s;hip the fir&s;t
opportunity.</P>
<P>This, my Lord, is a true &s;tate of the event. I have not
dwelt upon errors, be|cau&s;e in many in&s;tances they were counterbalanced by
&s;pirit. The enemy will of cour&s;e find matter of parade in the acqui&s;ition
of four pieces of cannon: but that apart, they have &s;mall cau&s;e of
exultation; their lo&s;s in killed and wounded being more than double to ours,
by the confe&s;&s;ion of their pri&s;oners and de&s;erters, and of many
inhabitants who were witne&s;&s;es to the burial of their dead.</P>
<P>The chief &s;ubject of regret on our &s;ide, after that which
any lo&s;s of gallant men naturally occa&s;ions, is the di&s;appointment of not
obtaining live cattle, and the lo&s;s of time in bringing forward the
magazines.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="170"> This heavy work is now nearly
completed, and a new bridge of boats is thrown over the Hud&s;on's River,
oppo&s;ite to Saratoga, the former one of rafts having been carried away by the
&s;well of water after the late continual rains. When enabled to move, nothing
within my &s;cale of talent &s;hall be left unattempted to fulfil his
Maje|&s;ty's orders, and I hope circum&s;tances will be &s;uch, that my
endeavours may be in &s;ome degree a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a co-operation of the army
under Sir William Howe.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER>[Private.]</OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NEED not enlarge upon the concern I have in communicating any
&s;ini&s;ter events. I am per&s;uaded your Lord&s;hip will give me credit for
partaking every &s;entiment that your Lord&s;hip, or any other man warmed with
principle and zeal in this conte&s;t, can feel.</P>
<P>In regard to the affair of Saintcoick, I have only to add to the
public account, that if ever there was a &s;ituation to ju&s;tify enterprize
and exertion, out of the beaten track of military &s;ervice, it was that in
which I found my&s;elf. Had I &s;ucceeded, I &s;hould have effected a junction
with St. Leger, and been now before Albany. And I flatter my&s;elf, I need only
mention tho&s;e views, to &s;hew that in hazarding this expedition I had the
&s;ounde&s;t principles of military rea&s;oning on my &s;ide, viz. that the
advantages to be expected from &s;ucce&s;s were in a great degree &s;uperior to
the evils that could at|tend mi&s;carriage. The &s;econdary purpo&s;es, to
which I alluded in the public letter, were to try the affections of the
country; to complete the Provincial corps, many re|cruits for which were unable
to e&s;cape from their villages without a force to encou|rage and protect them;
and to di&s;tract the councils of the enemy, by continuing their jealou&s;y
towards New England.</P>
<P>Major General Reide&s;el has pre&s;&s;ed upon me repeatedly the
mounting his dragoons, the men were animated with the &s;ame de&s;ire, and I
conceived it a mo&s;t favourable oc|ca&s;ion to give into their ideas and
&s;olicitations, becau&s;e in exerting their zeal to fulfil their favourite
purpo&s;e, they nece&s;&s;arily would effect the greater purpo&s;e of my own.
The re&s;t of the troops were &s;elected from &s;uch as would lea&s;t weaken
the &s;olid &s;trength of the army, in ca&s;e of ill &s;ucce&s;s; and I thought
it expedient to take a little trial of the Provincials and Canadians before I
might have occa&s;ion for them in more impor|tant actions.</P>
<P>The original detachment could not have been made larger without
opening roads, and other preparations of time, nor &s;hould I have thought it
ju&s;tifiable to expo&s;e the be&s;t troops to lo&s;s upon a collateral action.
Had my in&s;tructions been followed, or could Mr. Breyman have marked at the
rate of two miles an hour any given twelve hours out of the two and thirty,
&s;ucce&s;s would probably have en&s;ued, misfortune would certainly have been
avoided. I did not think it prudent, in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, to mark the&s;e
circum&s;tances to the public &s;o &s;trongly as I do in confidence to your 
<PB N="xxv" REF="171"> Lord&s;hip; but I rely, and I will venture to &s;ay I
expect, becau&s;e I think ju&s;tice will warrant the expectation, that while,
for the &s;ake of public harmony, that nece&s;&s;ary prin|ciple for conducting
nice and laborious &s;ervice, I colour the faults of the execution, your
Lord&s;hip will, in your goodne&s;s, be my advocate to the King, and to the
world, in vindication of the plan.</P>
<P>The con&s;equences of this affair, my Lord, have little effect
upon the &s;trength or &s;pirits of the army; but the pro&s;pect of the
campaign in other re&s;pects, is far le&s;s pro&s;perous than when I wrote
la&s;t. In &s;pire of St. Leger's victory, Fort Stanwix holds out
ob&s;tinately. I am afraid the expectations of Sir J. John&s;on greatly fail in
the ri&s;ing of the country. On this &s;ide I find daily rea&s;on to doubt the
&s;incerity of the re|&s;olution of the profe&s;&s;ing loyali&s;ts. I have
about 400, but not half of them armed, who may be depended upon; the re&s;t are
trimmers, merely actuated by intere&s;t. The great bulk of the country is
undoubtedly with the Congre&s;s, in principle and in zeal; and their mea&s;ures
are executed with a &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch that are not to be equalled.
Wherever the King's forces point, militia, to the amount of three or four
thou&s;and a&s;&s;emble in twenty-four hours; they bring with them their
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &amp;c. and, the alarm over, they return to their farms. The
Hamp&s;hire Grants in particular, a country unpeopled and almo&s;t unknown in
the la&s;t war, now abounds in the mo&s;t active and mo&s;t re|bellious race of
the continent, and hangs like a gathering &s;torm upon my left. In all parts
the indu&s;try and managment in driving cattle, and removing corn, are
indefati|gable and certain; and it becomes impracticable to move without
portable maga|zines. Another mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ing circum&s;tance, is the
want of communication with Sir William Howe; of the me&s;&s;engers I have
&s;ent, I know of two being hanged, and am ignorant whether any of the re&s;t
arrived. The &s;ame fate has pro|bably attended tho&s;e di&s;patched by Sir
William Howe; for only one letter is come to hand, informing me that his
intention is for Pen&s;ylvania; that Wa&s;hington has de|tached Sullivan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> with 2500 men to Albany; that Putnam is
in the Highlands, with 4000 men. That after my arrival at Albany, the movements
of the enemy mu&s;t guide mine; but that he wi&s;hed the enemy might be driven
out of the province be|fore any operation took place again&s;t the Connecticut;
that Sir Henry Clinton remain|ed in the command in the neighbourhood of
New-York, and would act as occurrences might direct.</P>
<P>No operation, my Lord, has yet been undertaken in my favour: the
highlands have not even been threatened. The con&s;equence is, that Putnam has
detached two brigades to Mr. Gates, who is now &s;trongly po&s;ted near the
mouth of the Mohawk-River, with an army &s;uperior to mine in troops of the
Congre&s;s, and as many militia as he plea&s;es. He is likewi&s;e far from
being deficient in artillery, having received all the pieces that were landed
from the French &s;hips which got into Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>Had I a latitude in my orders, I &s;hould think it my duty to
wait in this po&s;ition, or perhaps as far back as Fort Edward, where my
communication with Lake George would be perfectly &s;ecure, till &s;ome event
happened to a&s;&s;i&s;t my movement forward; but my orders being po&s;itive to

<Q REND="inline">"force a junction with Sir William Howe,"</Q> I
appre|hend I am not at liberty to remain inactive longer than &s;hall be
nece&s;&s;ary to collect twenty-five days provi&s;ion, and to receive the
reinforcement of the additional com|panies, the German drafts and recruits now
(and unfortunately only now) on Lake Champlain. The waiting the arrival of this
reinforcement is of indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity, becau&s;e from the hour I
pa&s;s the Hud&s;on's River and proceed towards Albany, all 
<PB N="xxvi" REF="172"> &s;afety of communication cea&s;es. I mu&s;t expect a
large body of the enemy from my left will take po&s;t behind me. I have put out
of the que&s;tion the waiting longer than the time nece&s;&s;ary for the
foregoing purpo&s;es, becau&s;e the attempt, then critical, de|pending on
adventure and the fortune that often accompanies it, and hardly ju&s;tifiable
but by orders from the &s;tate, would afterwards be con&s;ummately de&s;perate.
I mean my Lord, that by moving &s;oon, though I &s;hould meet with
in&s;urmountable difficul|ties to my progre&s;s, I &s;hall at lea&s;t have the
chance of fighting my way back to Ticon|deroga, but the &s;ea&s;on a little
further advanced, the di&s;tance encrea&s;ed, and the march unavoidably tardy,
becau&s;e &s;urrounded by enemies, a retreat might be &s;hut by im|penetrable
bars or the elements, and at the &s;ame time no po&s;&s;ible means of
exi&s;tence remain in the country.</P>
<P>When I wrote more confidently, I little fore&s;aw that I was to
be left to pur&s;ue my way through &s;uch a tract of country, and ho&s;ts of
foes, without any co-operation from New-York; nor did I then think the
garri&s;on of Ticonderoga would fall to my &s;hare alone, a dangerous
experiment would it be to leave that po&s;t in weakne&s;s, and too heavy a
drain it is upon the life-blood of my force to give it due &s;trength.</P>
<P>I yet do not de&s;pond.&mdash;Should I &s;ucceed in forcing my
way to Albany, and find that country in a &s;tate to &s;ub&s;i&s;t my army, I
&s;hall think no more of a retreat, but at the wor&s;t fortify there and await
Sir W. Howe's operations.</P>
<P>Whatever may be my fate, my Lord, I &s;ubmit my actions to the
brea&s;t of the King, and to the candid judgment of my profe&s;&s;ion, when all
the motives become public; and I re&s;t in the confidence, that whatever
deci&s;ion may be pa&s;&s;ed upon my conduct, my good intent will not be
que&s;tioned.</P>
<P>I cannot clo&s;e &s;o &s;erious a letter without expre&s;&s;ing
my fulle&s;t &s;atisfaction in the be|haviour and countenance of the troops,
and my compleat confidence that in all trials they will do whatever can be
expected from men devoted to their King and country.</P>

<P>P. S. Upon re-peru&s;ing this letter, I am apprehen&s;ive that
the manner in which I have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, re&s;pecting the

not mean to impute the delay to any thing but accidents, nor do I mean to

requi&s;itions to garri&s;on Ticonderoga, I only lament it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have received yours of the &s;econd in&s;tant on the 15th,
have fince heard from the rebel army of your being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Ticonderoga, <HI>which is a great event, carried without lo&s;s.</HI> I have
received your two letters, <HI>viz.</HI> from Plymouth and Quebec, your la&s;t
of the 14th May, and &s;hall ob&s;erve the contents. There is a report of a
me&s;&s;enger of yours to me having been taken, and the letter di&s;covered in
a double wooden canteen, you will know if it was of any con&s;equence; nothing
of it has tran|&s;pired to us. I will ob&s;erve the <HI>&s;ame rules</HI> in
writing to you, as you propo&s;e, in your <PB N="xxvii" REF="173"> letters to
me. Wa&s;hington is waiting our motions here, and has detached Sullivan with
about 2500 men, as I learn, to Albany. My intention is for Pen&s;ylvania, where
I expect to meet Wa&s;hington, but if he goes to the northward contrary to my
expectations, and you can keep him at bay, be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall &s;oon be
after him to relieve you.</P>
<P>After your arrival at Albany, the movements of the enemy will
guide yours; but my wi&s;hes are, that the enemy be drove out of this province
before any operation takes place in Connecticut. Sir Henry Clinton remains in
the command here, and will act as occurences my direct. Putnam is in the
highlands with about 4000 men. Succe&s;s be ever with you.</P>

<P>I received your letter of the 20th of October, with your
public di&s;patches by Captain Craig, the 5th in&s;tant, and heartily condole
with you upon the very di&s;a|greeable accounts they contain, all which I
&s;incerely lamented, both on the public account and your own.</P>
<P>This unfortunate event, it is to be hoped, will in future
prevent mini&s;ters from pretending to direct operations of war, in a country
at three thou&s;and miles di|&s;tance, of which they have &s;o little knowledge
as not to be able to di&s;tingui&s;h between good, bad, or intere&s;ted
advices, or to give po&s;itive orders in matters, which from their nature, are
ever upon the change; &s;o that the expedience or propriety of a mea|&s;ure at
one moment, may be totally inexpedient or improper in the next.</P>
<P>Having given over all hopes of being relieved this fall. I
determined upon &s;ending home Captain Foy, to furni&s;h his Maje&s;ty's
confidential &s;ervants, and my &s;ucce&s;&s;or, with the be&s;t information in
my power, of the &s;tate of affairs in this province, that they may form the

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the liberty of informing your Excellency, that there has
yet been no arrange|ment made for marching the field artillery by land,
&s;hould the corps of troops upon an expedition under your command in the
cour&s;e of the campaign quit the lakes Champlain and George, and the
rivers.</P>
<P>I have, upon the &s;tricte&s;t information which could be
procured, rea&s;on to believe, that neither carriages nor hor&s;es will be to
be had nearer than Albany, &s;hould the route of your army be that way, and
even in that country, it will nece&s;&s;arily require a con|&s;iderable time
before any can be got; all which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily delay the operations of
the campaign, after the reduction of Ticonderoga. I therefore &s;ubmit to your
Excellency's con&s;ideration whether hor&s;es and &s;uch ammunition-carriages
as may be wanted &s;hould not be procured for the &s;ervice of the campaign,
for the field artillery attached to the corps of troops your Excellency is to
command this campaign?</P>

<P>I HAVE the honour of your Excellency's letter to me of
ye&s;terday, in an&s;wer to one I wrote on the &s;ubject of the field-artillery
being &s;upplied with hor&s;es, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>You are plea&s;ed, Sir, to order me to give an opinion upon
the mode of procuring hor&s;es and carriages from this country, combining the
con&s;ideration of di&s;patch, &s;ufficiency, and oeconomy towards
government.</P>
<P>There are but two modes of procuring hor&s;es for the
&s;ervice, &s;uppo&s;ing the country is not to furni&s;h them upon
Corv&eacute;es, the one is by purcha&s;ing of hor&s;es upon the account of
government, the other by contract.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e modes has always appeared to me
difficult, uncertain, and full of openings for every &s;pecies of impo&s;ition,
and the expence uncertain.&mdash;Government mu&s;t tru&s;t various people to
buy hor&s;es, and in this country it will not be po&s;&s;ible to procure any
per&s;ons who will not immediately pur&s;ue the views of gaining money to
them&s;elves with a con&s;ideration for the King's &s;ervice. Add to this, that
it will be|come &s;uch a charge, that many commi&s;&s;aries mu&s;t be
appointed, and various other officers of that &s;ort, &amp;c, which being a
mixture of in&s;pectors into the purcha&s;es of hor&s;es, and nece&s;&s;arily
al&s;o at times the being purcha&s;ers, it will be difficult ever to
a&s;certain the price, and &s;eldom that the goodne&s;s of hor&s;es can be
depended on.</P>
<P>I have &s;een in my &s;ervice this mode attempted, but it has
to my knowledge failed. I mu&s;t allow, that could it be carried into execution
complete, it would be the cheape&s;t for government: but taking into
con&s;ideration the various impo&s;itions which will ari&s;e, and that the
&s;etting out on a plan of this nature will require a very large &s;um of
mo|ney, <PB N="xxx" REF="176"> perhaps from 20,000l. to 30,000l. to be
intru&s;ted into various hands, I freely give it as my opinion that it is not a
perfect plan. The contracting for a certain num|ber of hor&s;es at a fixed
price for the hire by day reduces the whole to a very &s;imple, and therefore
generally a certain plan. It depends in the &s;etting out, by making as cheap,
as fair, and ju&s;t a bargain on the part of government as can be. And being
&s;o made, that the military and civil officers do their duty, by attending to
the receiving of hor&s;es only as they are fitting for &s;ervice. The
contractor has his intere&s;t &s;o di|rectly connected with fulfilling his
contract, as upon failure it cea&s;es, that he will exert all means to do it,
and the care of government will be that it be done hone&s;tly and
compleatly.</P>
<P>I have thus obeyed your Excellency's orders, and given an
opinion which I &s;ubmit entirely to your con&s;ideration.</P>

<P>I BEG the favour of you to calculate what number of hor&s;es

will be &s;ufficient for conveying by land thirty days provi&s;ion for 10,000

<OPENER><DATELINE>Montreal, 
<DATE>June 7, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING had the honor to repre&s;ent to your Excellency the
nece&s;&s;ity of being provided with a certain number of hor&s;es and carriages
for the artillery, victual, and other indi&s;pen&s;ible purpo&s;es of the army,
when it &s;hall be obliged to quit the borders of the lakes and rivers; and
having under&s;tood from your Excellency that &s;uch pro|vi&s;ion could not be
made by the ordinary methods of cov&eacute;e, and that if propo&s;ed without
compul&s;ion upon the country the effect would be precarious, dilatory, and
expen&s;ive; I have the honour now to lay before your Excellency propo&s;als
for con|tracts for an expeditious &s;upply of hor&s;es for the artillery, and
500 carts, with two hor&s;es each, for the other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>I am too ignorant of the prices of the country to offer any
judgment upon the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the&s;e propo&s;als; nor have I any
long acquaintance with Mr. Jordan, or other motive for wi&s;hing him the
preference, if other per&s;ons can be found equally capable, re&s;pon&s;ible,
and expeditious. I have only thus far interfered, upon a con|viction, after
con&s;idering the route the King's orders direct, and taking all po&s;&s;ible
methods of information upon the &s;upply to be expected as we proceed, that to
de|pend upon the country altogether would be to hazard the expedition.</P>
<P>Your Excellency will ob&s;erve, that in order to &s;ave the
public expence as much as po&s;&s;ible, I have reduced this requi&s;ition much
below what would be adequate to the &s;ervice, and I mean to tru&s;t to the
re&s;ources of the expedition for the re&s;t; 500 carts will barely carry
fourteen days provi&s;ions at a time, and Major General Phillips means 
<PB N="xxxi" REF="177"> to demand as few hor&s;es as po&s;&s;ible, &s;ubject to
whatever future augmentations future &s;ervices may require; the pre&s;ent
number wanted will be about 400; there will then remain unprovided for (for
expeditious movement) the tran&s;port of bateaux from Lake George to Hud&s;on's
River, and the carriage of the tents of the army, and many other contingencies
that I need not trouble your Excellency to point out to you.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter to <HI>General Harvey.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Montreal, 
<DATE>May 19, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have permitted me, as formerly, to write to you
confidentially. I take the fir&s;t conveyance to renew a corre&s;pondence &s;o
plea&s;ing and honourable to my&s;elf, and that may, in &s;ome ca&s;es, become
beneficial to the public &s;ervice. It &s;hall never be employed but to convey
truths, to do ju&s;tice to facts and per&s;ons, and to &s;ecure my&s;elf in the
continuance of an e&s;teem &s;o valuable to me as yours again&s;t appearances
and mi&s;repre&s;entations.</P>
<P>I have rea&s;on to be exceedingly &s;atisfied with all that
has been done, and with mo&s;t things that are doing: exertions have been made
during the winter, which was remark|ably favourable, in all the departments,
and preparations are very forward; tho&s;e that have been committed to the
directions of General Phillips have been executed with a diligence,
preci&s;ion, and fore&s;ight, that entitle him to the fulle&s;t prai&s;e. The
troops are in a &s;tate of health almo&s;t unprecedented, and their &s;pirits
and general improvement are equally objects of great plea&s;ure and promi&s;e.
To this agreeable repre&s;entation I have the happine&s;s to add, that Sir Guy
Carleton has received me and the orders I brought in a manner that, in my
opinion, does infinite honour to his public and private character.</P>
<P>That he &s;hould have wi&s;hed for the lead in active and
important military operations, is very natural. That he thinks he has &s;ome
cau&s;e of re&s;entment for the general tenor of treatment he has received from
&s;ome of the mini&s;ters is di&s;cernible; but neither his di&s;appointment
nor his per&s;onal feelings operate again&s;t his duty; and I am convinced he
means to forward the King's mea&s;ures, entru&s;ted to my hands, with all the
zeal he could have employed had they re&s;ted in his own.</P>
<P>My intention is, during my advance to Ticonderoga, and &s;iege
of that po&s;t, for a &s;iege I apprehend it mu&s;t be, to give all
po&s;&s;ible jealou&s;y on the &s;ide of Connecticut. If I can by manoeuvre
make them &s;u&s;pect that after the reduction of Ticonderoga my views are
pointed that way, it may make the Connecticut forces very cautious of leaving
their own frontiers, and much facilitate my progre&s;s to Albany. I mention
this intention only to Lord George and your&s;elf, and I do it le&s;t from any
intelligence of my motions that may reach England indirectly, it &s;hould be
&s;uppo&s;ed I have &s;uffer|ed my&s;elf to be diverted from the main object of
my orders. The King and his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that
whatever demon&s;trations I may endeavour to impo&s;e upon the enemy, I &s;hall
really make no movement that can procra&s;tinate my progre&s;s to Albany.</P>
<P>One thing more occurs. I had the &s;urpri&s;e and
mortification to find a paper handed about at Montreal, publi&s;hing the whole
de&s;ign of the campaign, almo&s;t as accurately as if it had been copied from
the Secretary of State's letter. My own cau|tion <PB N="xxxii" REF="178"> has
been &s;uch that not a man in my own family has been let into the &s;ecret. Sir
Guy Carleton's, I am confident, has been equal; I am therefore led to doubt
whether imprudence has not been committed from private letters from England,
and wi&s;h you would a&s;k my friend D'Oyley, to whom my very affectionate
compliments, whether there is any per&s;on within the line of mini&s;terial
communication that he can &s;u&s;pect to be &s;o unguarded? It is not of great
con&s;equence here, except as far as regards St. Leger's expedition; but &s;uch
a trick may be of mo&s;t prejudicial con&s;equence in other ca&s;es, and
&s;hould be guarded again&s;t.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Camp on the River Bouquet, near Lake Champlain,

<DATE>June 22, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had to contend again&s;t wet weather that rendered the
roads almo&s;t im|practicable at the carrying places, and con&s;equently the
pa&s;&s;age of the bateaux and exceedingly dilatory, be&s;ides a great deal of
contrary wind. Indeed the combination of land and water movement, bad roads,
inactivity and &s;ometimes di&s;obedience in the country, and a thou&s;and
other difficulties and accidents, unknown in other &s;ervices, di&s;concert all
arrangements. I do not mention this upon my own account, as I do not hold
my&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for delays within the province of Canada; but I
mention it to do ju&s;tice to others, who, I really think, have infinite merit
in overcoming the ob&s;tructions we have met with, and who ought to be
ju&s;tified again&s;t &s;ome acquain|tances of yours and mine, who travel
acro&s;s a map very fa&s;t, and are very free in their comments, when others,
who have ten times their knowledge and re&s;ources, do not an&s;wer their
predictions and expectations.</P>
<P>I have been exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in regard to the
brigadiers of this army. Sir Guy Carleton, the day I took leave of him, put
into my hands an extract of a letter from the Secretary at War, approving the
appointment of tho&s;e gentlemen, but ob&s;erving, that whenever any of them
&s;hould <HI>lead their brigades out of the province of Canada, in order to
join the troops under General Howe,</HI> there would be a nece&s;&s;ity for
their command cea&s;ing as brigadiers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Were this to be put in execution, according to the letter of
the order, and the geo|graphical limits of Canada, and &s;uppo&s;ing Major
General Phillips at the &s;ame time to be employed &s;olely in the artillery, I
&s;hould find my&s;elf at the head of an army to undertake a &s;iege, and
afterwards pur&s;ue objects of importance, and po&s;&s;ibly of time, without a
&s;ingle intermediate Briti&s;h officer between the Lieutenant General,
com|manding <HI>pro tempore</HI> in chief, and a Lieutenant Colonel. It would
be prepo&s;terous and impertinent in me to &s;ay one word more to you as an
officer, upon the impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of methodizing or conducting &s;uch an
army with &s;uch a total deficiency of &s;taff. Had Lord Barrington
conde&s;cended to have communicated his intentions to me in London, I think I
could have convinced him of the impropriety. As it is, I mu&s;t conclude that
the &s;pirit of the order goes only to prevent tho&s;e gentlemen bearing a
higher rank and pay than &s;enior lieutenant colonels &s;erving in the &s;ame
army; and that therefore there can be no fault in keeping it dormant till the
junction takes place. In other words, I look upon mine to be the Canada army
till &s;uch time as I am in communication with General Howe, &s;o as to make
part of his force, and con&s;equently <PB N="xxxiii" REF="179"> without
mea&s;uring degrees north and &s;outh, that the arrangements made in Canada,
and approved of by the King, remain in force till that time.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded, my dear General, you will &s;upport me in
this liberty, if &s;uch it is to be called, not only as the ab&s;olute order
and method of the &s;ervice depends upon it, but al&s;o to avoid to the&s;e
gentlemen, who have really great merit, the vexation and the ridicule of being
deprived of their rank and pay in the hour of that very &s;ervice, with a view
to which their appointment was originally made. I think I can an&s;wer, that
the junction made, and the rea&s;ons for reverting to their former ranks,
become obvious, they will &s;ubmit to his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure without a
murmur.</P>

<P>THE mere compliment of &s;ervice I have given to the troops in
orders, and in the relation de&s;igned for the Gazette, is not doing them
&s;ufficient ju&s;tice. It is a duty in me further, through you, and I know I
&s;hall impo&s;e a plea&s;ing ta&s;k on you, to a&s;&s;ure the King that their
behaviour is as uniformly good in the camp as in action.</P>
<P>After what I have publicly mentioned of Fra&s;er I am &s;ure I
need not pre&s;s you in his favour. I cannot but feel confident in the hope
that his Maje&s;ty's grace will find its way through all ob&s;tacles to prevent
&s;o di&s;couraging a circum&s;tance as the return of this gallant officer to
the mere duty of lieutenant colonel, at the head of one batta|lion, after
having given a&s;cendancy to the King's troops, and done honour to his
profe&s;&s;ion, by the mo&s;t &s;pirited actions in critical periods of two
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive cam|paigns.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, Sir, both in the public letter and in the
order of battle, which Captain Gardner will put into your hands, that Major
General Phillips is occa&s;ionally employed &s;eparately from the &s;trict line
of his department. This does not proceed from inattention to the explanation of
his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure two years ago; but from ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.
The &s;taff being compo&s;ed without any Briti&s;h major general, Bri|gadier
Fra&s;er being po&s;ted where he is of infinite u&s;e, at the head of the
advanced corps, the &s;ervice would &s;uffer in the mo&s;t material degree if
the talents of General Phillips were not &s;uffered to extend beyond the limits
of the artillery, and I hold my&s;elf fully ju&s;tified in continuing the great
u&s;e of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance under this exten&s;ion, by what I under&s;tand to
be the &s;ignification of the King's plea&s;ure to Sir Guy Carleton, viz.
<HI>That this mea&s;ure mu&s;t not be made a precedent,</HI> but not forbidding
it during the pre&s;ent exigency.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf the King will be &s;atisfied with the
diligence u&s;ed in taking the field, as well as with the &s;ub&s;equent
operations; if not, my di&s;appointment can only proceed from my own deficiency
in &s;tating the embarra&s;&s;ments I found, notwith&s;tanding pre|vious
preparations and cordial a&s;&s;i&s;tances. Remote &s;ituations of the troops,
currents, winds, roads, want of materials for caulking the ve&s;&s;els,
inactivity and de&s;ertion of the Canadian corv&eacute;es, were all again&s;t
me. A great difficulty lay in providing hor&s;es and carriages for the bare
tran&s;port of provi&s;ions and tents, when we &s;hould arrive at Fort George,
or any other place where the army &s;hould have no re&s;ource of water
carriage. I found an active, and I think a rea&s;onable contractor, who
&s;upplied this nece&s;&s;ity at a much cheaper rate than it could have been
done any other way. <PB N="xxxiv" REF="180"> I inclo&s;e a copy of the contract
to the trea&s;ury, to which I refer you. You will ob|&s;erve that I have
limited the number to the mere indi&s;pen&s;ible purpo&s;es of provi&s;ions and
tents, tru&s;ting to the country for the further a&s;&s;i&s;tance of officers
baggage and the other attirail of an army. Experience already &s;hews me that I
judged right in not tru&s;ting to the country for more; for had this precaution
been omitted, I &s;hould be bound fa&s;t to the &s;pot where I am, or obliged
to return by water to Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>I avow al&s;o to you my advice to General Carleton to grant
commi&s;&s;ions to two pro|vincial battalions, to be rai&s;ed from Albany and
Charlotte County, by a Mr. Je&s;&s;up and a Mr. Peters, upon condition that the
commi&s;&s;ions &s;hould not take place till two thirds of the corps &s;hould
be effective, provincial corps, acting zealou&s;ly in the King's cau&s;e,
mu&s;t have great impre&s;&s;ion upon public opinion, and will, be&s;ides, in
fact be of &s;ingular u&s;e to the ea&s;e and pre&s;ervation of the regular
troops.</P>
<P>Upon this principle, therefore, I have not he&s;itated further
to receive and to pay &s;uch loyali&s;ts as have come in with their arms
&s;ince the &s;ucce&s;s of Ticonderoga, and wi&s;h to be employed. Though I
have not power to grant commi&s;&s;ions, I po&s;t the officers, and form them
into companies till the mea&s;ure can be decided by tho&s;e who have more
authority.</P>
<P>I hope all the&s;e articles of expence will meet with the
&s;upport of your opinion; and have only to add, that as no job &s;hall be done
my&s;elf, &s;o will I u&s;e all efforts to pre|vent &s;uch being done by
others.</P>
<P>I am indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to wait &s;ome time on this
po&s;ition, to clear roads and make bridges, which is great labour in this
country, and to bring up a &s;tock of provi&s;ion, and al&s;o to give time to
the gun-boats, bateaux, and provi&s;ion ve&s;&s;els to be put into Lake George
to &s;cour that lake, and &s;ecure the future route of the maga|zines. I
propo&s;e to po&s;&s;e&s;s Fort Edward at the &s;ame time that the force is
ready to move down the lake, by which means, if the enemy do not evacuate Fort
George, the garri&s;on mu&s;t inevitably be caught. In the mean while I have
ordered Reide&s;el to make roads, reconnoitre the country, and make all other
po&s;&s;ible feints of a march to the Connecticut, and by &s;ome other
mea&s;ures I hope to give alarms that way.</P>

that one man may lead ten hor&s;es. You will give the unarmed men of Peters's
corps to conduct them, and inha|hitants whom you can tru&s;t. You mu&s;t
al|ways take your camps in good po&s;ition; but at the &s;ame time where there
is pa&s;ture, and you mu&s;t have a chain of centinels round your cattle and

<P>IN con&s;equence of your Excellency's orders I moved this
morning at four o'clock, with the corps under my command; and after a march of
&s;ixteen miles arrived at Cambridge at four in the evening. On the road I
received intelligence of forty or fifty of the rebels being left to guard
&s;ome cattle. I immediately ordered thirty of the provincials and fifty
&s;avages to quicken their march, in hopes to &s;ur|prize them. They took five
pri&s;oners in arms, who declared them&s;elves to be in the &s;ervice of the
Congre&s;s; yet the enemy received advice of our approach, and abandoned the
hou&s;e they were po&s;ted in. The provincials and &s;avages continued their
march about a mile, when they fell in with a party of fifteen men, who fired
upon our people, and immediately took to the woods with the greate&s;t
precipita|tion. The fire was quick on our &s;ide, but I cannot learn if the
enemy &s;u&s;tained any lo&s;s. A private of Captain Sherwood's company was the
only one who was &s;lightly wounded in the thigh. From the many people who came
from Benning|ton they agree that the number of the enemy amounted to 1800. I
will be particu|larly careful, on my approach at that place, to be fully
informed of their &s;trength and &s;ituation, and take the precautions
nece&s;&s;ary to fulfil both the orders and in&s;tructions of your
Excellency.</P>
<P>I cannot a&s;certain the number of cattle, carts, and waggons
taken here, as they have not been as yet collected. A few hor&s;es have been
al&s;o brought in, but am &s;orry to acquaint your Excellency that the
&s;avages either de&s;troy or drive away what is not paid for with ready money.
If your Excellency would allow me to purcha&s;e the hor&s;es from the
&s;avages, &s;tipulating the price, I think they might be procured cheap,
otherwi&s;e they ruin all they meet with, their officers and interpre|ters not
having it in their power to controul them. Your Excellency may depend

here at eight in the morning, having had intelligence of a party of the enemy
being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a mill, which they abandoned at our approach,

Bennington; a &s;avage was &s;lightly wounded; they broke down the bridge which
has retarded our march above an hour, they left in the mill about
&s;eventy-eight barrels of very fine flour, 1000 bu&s;hels of wheat, 20 barrels
of &s;alt, and about 1000l. worth pearl and pot a&s;h. I have ordered thirty
pro|vincials and an officer to guard the provi&s;ion and the pa&s;s of the
bridge. By five pri|&s;oners taken here, they agree that 1500 to 1800 men are
in Bennington, but are &s;up|po&s;ed to leave it on our approach; I will
proceed &s;o far to-day as to fall on the the enemy to-morrow early, and make
&s;uch di&s;po&s;ition as I think nece&s;&s;ary from the intelligence I may
receive. People are flocking in hourly, but want to be armed; the &s;avages

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Lieutenant General
<HI>Burgoyne,</HI> to Sir <HI>Guy Carleton,</HI> dated Head-Quarters, at
Skene&s;borough Hou&s;e, 11th July, 1777.</HEAD>
<P>I REQUEST your Excellency to take into con&s;ideration the
expediency of &s;upply|ing from Canada, a garri&s;on for Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>My communication will widen &s;o much as I proceed, the drain
upon the army for po&s;ts will be &s;o con&s;iderable, not to &s;peak of
detachments and &s;afe-guards to protect and to awe the country, that if that
fir&s;t diminution is not replaced, my effective &s;trength may become
inadequate to the &s;ervices intended. My pre&s;ent intelligence is that Putnam
is collecting an army to oppo&s;e me at Saratoga. Fort Edward is al&s;o talked
of to &s;u&s;tain a &s;iege.</P>
<P>Your excellency will, I am &s;ure, agree with me that
Ticonderoga, or &s;ome other fortified po&s;t on the South part of Lake
Champlain, ought to be con&s;idered on the frontiers of the province of Canada.
I am aware of the difficulties that ari&s;e from the manner in which the
Secretary of State's orders are penned; but I &s;ubmit to your Excellency,
whether, under the principle laid down in the beginning of the order, and
afterwards repeated, <HI>that</HI> 3000 <HI>men were held &s;ufficient for the
defence of that province,</HI> you would not be ju&s;tified in &s;paring for
the purpo&s;e of this garri&s;on, the overplus of the 3000 that may remain
after compleating my army.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding the corps for the Canada &s;ervice are
preci&s;ely named by the Secretary of State, I would further &s;ubmit whether,
upon my pre&s;&s;ing requi&s;ition, the garri&s;on might not ju&s;tifiably be

<HI>Burgoyne,</HI> to Sir <HI>Guy Carleton,</HI> Head-Quarters, near Fort Anne,
July 29th 1777.</HEAD>
<P>THE con&s;truction your excellency puts upon the orders of the
Secretary of State, is too full and deci&s;ive for me to pre&s;ume to trouble
you further upon the &s;ubject of a garri&s;on for Ticonderoga from Canada, I
mu&s;t do as well as I can, but I am &s;ure your Excellency, as a &s;oldier,
will think my &s;ituation a little difficult. A breach into my communication
mu&s;t either ruin my army entirely, or oblige me to return in force to
re&s;tore, which might be the lo&s;s of the campaign. To prevent a breach,
Ticonderoga and Fort George mu&s;t be in very re&s;pectable &s;trength, and I
mu&s;t be&s;ides have po&s;ts at Fort Edward and other carrying-places. The&s;e
drains added to common accidents and lo&s;&s;es of &s;ervice, will
nece&s;&s;arily render me very inferior in <PB N="xliii" REF="189"> point of
numbers to the enemy, whom I mu&s;t expect always to find &s;trongly po&s;ted.
I a&s;k pardon for dwelling &s;o much upon this &s;ubject, and have only to add
my re|que&s;t to your Excellency to forward the additional companies as
expeditiou&s;ly as may be.</P>

<P>THE accounts you have &s;ent me are very &s;atisfactory, and I
have no doubt of every part of your proceeding continuing to be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I beg the favour of you to report whether the road you have
pa&s;&s;ed is practicable, and if &s;o, if it is convenient for a
con&s;iderable corps with cannon.</P>
<P>Should you find the enemy too &s;trongly po&s;ted at
Bennington, and maintaining &s;uch a countenance as may make an attack
imprudent, I wi&s;h you to take a po&s;t where you can maintain your&s;elf till
you receive an an&s;wer from me, and I will either &s;upport you in force, or
withdraw you.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to &s;end off to my camp, as &s;oon as you
can, waggons, and draft cattle, and likewi&s;e &s;uch other cattle as are not
nece&s;&s;ary for your &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Let the waggons and carts bring off all the flour and wheat
they can that you do not retain for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. This tran&s;port

<P>I will write you at full to-morrow in regard to getting

<HI>Leger's</HI> Account of Occurrences at <HI>Fort Stanwix.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A MINUTE detail of every operation &s;ince my leaving La Chine,
with the de|tachment entru&s;ted to my care, your Excellency will permit me to
re&s;erve to a time of le&s;s hurry and mortification than the pre&s;ent, while
I enter into the intere&s;ting &s;cene before Fort Stanwix, which I inve&s;ted
the 3d of Augu&s;t, having previou&s;ly pu&s;hed forward Lieutenant Bird of the
King's reigment, with thirty of the King's troops and two hundred Indians,
under the direction of Captains Hare and Wil&s;on, and the chiefs Jo&s;eph and
Bull, to &s;eize fa&s;t hold of the lower landing-place, and there|by cut off
the enemy's communication with the lower country.&mdash;This was done with
great addre&s;s by the lieutenant, though not attended with the effect I had
promi&s;ed my&s;elf, occa&s;ioned by the &s;lackne&s;s of the
Me&s;&s;a&s;agoes. The brigade of provi&s;ion and ammunition boats I had
intelligence of, being arrived and di&s;embarked before this party had taken
po&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="lxiv" REF="190"> The fourth and fifth were employed in
making arrangements for opening Wood Creek (which the enemy, with the
indefatigable labour of one hundred and fifty men, for fourteen days, had
mo&s;t effectually choaked up) and the making a tempo|rary road from Pine
Ridges upon Fi&s;h Creek, &s;ixteen miles from the fort, for a pre&s;ent
&s;upply of provi&s;ion and the tran&s;port of our artillery: the fir&s;t was
effected by the diligence and zeal of Captain Bouville, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
Captain Harkimer of the Indian department, with one hundred and ten men, in
nine days; while Lieutenant Lundy, acting as a&s;&s;i&s;tant quarter-ma&s;ter
general, had rendered the road in the wor&s;t of weather, &s;ufficiently
practicable to pa&s;s the whole artillery and &s;tores, with &s;even days
provi&s;ion, in two days.</P>
<P>On the 5th, in the evening, intelligence arrived by my
di&s;covering parties on the Mohawk River, that a reinforcement of eight
hundred militia, conducted by General Herkimer, were on their march to relieve
the garri&s;on, and were actually at that in|&s;tant at Ori&s;ka, an Indian
&s;ettlement, twelve miles from the fort. The garri&s;on be|ing appri&s;ed of
their march by four men, who were &s;een enter the fort in the mor|ning,
through what was thought an impenetrable &s;wamp, I did not think it pru|dent
to wait for them, and thereby &s;ubject my&s;elf to be attacked by a &s;ally
from the garri&s;on in the rear, while the reinforcement employed me in front.
I therefore de|termined to attack them on the march, either openly or covertly,
as circum&s;tances &s;hould offer. At this time, I had not two hundred and
fifty of the King's troops in camp; the various and exten&s;ive operations I
was under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of entering into, having employed the
re&s;t; and therefore, could not &s;end above eighty white men, rangers and
troops included, with the whole corps of Indians. Sir John John&s;on put
him&s;elf at the head of this party, and began his march that evening at five
o'clock, and met the rebel corps at the &s;ame hour the next morning. The
im|petuo&s;ity of the Indians is not to be de&s;cribed on the &s;ight of the
enemy (forgetting the judicious di&s;po&s;ition formed by Sir John, and agreed
to by them&s;elves, which was, to &s;uffer the attack to begin with the troops
in front, while they &s;hould be on both flanks and rear) they ru&s;hed in,
hatchet in hand, and thereby gave the enemy's rear an op|portunity to e&s;cape.
In relation to the victory, it was equally complete, as if the whole had
fallen; nay more &s;o, as the two hundred who e&s;caped only &s;erved to
&s;pread the panic wider; but it was not &s;o with the Indians; their lo&s;s
was great (I mu&s;t be under&s;tood Indian computation, being only about thirty
killed, and the like number wounded, and in that number &s;ome of their
favourite chiefs and confidential warriors were &s;lain.) On the enemy's
&s;ide, almo&s;t all their principal leaders were &s;lain. Ge|neral Herkimer
has &s;ince died of his wounds. It is proper to mention, that the four men
detached with intelligence of the march of the reinforcement, &s;et out the
evening before the action, and con&s;equently the enemy could have no account
of the defeat, and were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion only, of the time appointed for
their arrival; at which, as I &s;u&s;pected, they made a &s;ally with two
hundred and fifty men towards Lieutenant Bird's po&s;t, to facilitate the
entrance of the relieving corps, or bring on a general en|gagement, with every
advantage they could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Captain Hoyes was immediately detached to cut in upon their
rear, while they engaged the lieutenant. Immediately upon the departure of
Captain Hoyes, having learned that Lieutenant Bird, mi&s;led by the information
of a cowardly Indian, that Sir John was pre&s;&s;ed, had quitted his po&s;t to
march to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I marched <PB N="lxvii" REF="191"> the
detachment of the King's regiment, in &s;upport of Captain Hoyes, by a road in
&s;ight of the garri&s;on, which, with executive fire from his party,
immediately drove the enemy into the fort, without any further advantage than
frightening &s;ome &s;quaws and pilfering the packs of the warriors which they
left behind them. After this affair was over, orders were immediately given to
compleat a two-gun battery, and mortar beds, with three &s;trong redoubts in
their rear, to enable me, in ca&s;e of another attempt, to relieve the
garri&s;on by their regimented troops, to march out a larger body of the King's
troops.</P>
<P>Captain Lernoult was &s;ent with 110 men to the lower landing
place, where he e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf with great judgment and &s;trength,
having an enclo&s;ed battery of a three-pounder oppo&s;ed to any &s;ally from
the fort, and another to the &s;ide of the country, where a relief mu&s;t
approach; and the body of his camp deeply en|trenched and abbati&s;ed.</P>
<P>When by the unabating labour of officers and men (the
&s;mallne&s;s of our num|bers never admitting of a relief, or above three hours
ce&s;&s;ation for &s;leep or cooking) the batteries and redoubts were
fini&s;hed, and new cheeks and axle-trees made for the &s;ix-pounders, tho&s;e
that were &s;ent being reported rotten and un&s;erviceable.</P>
<P>It was found that our cannon had not the lea&s;t effect upon the
&s;od-work of the fort, and that our royals had only the power of teizing, as a
&s;ix-inch plank was a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for their powder magazine, as we
learnt from the de&s;erters. At this time Lieutenant Glenie of the artillery,
whom I had appointed to act as a&s;&s;i&s;tant engineer, propo&s;ed a
conver&s;ion of the royals (if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) into howitzers.
The ingenuity and fea&s;ability of this mea&s;ure &s;triking me very
&s;trongly, the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;et about immediately, and &s;oon executed,
when it was found that nothing prevented their operating with the de&s;ired
effect but the di&s;tance, their chambers being too &s;mall to hold a
&s;ufficiency of powder. There was nothing now to be done but to approach the
town by &s;ap to &s;uch a di&s;tance that the ram|part might be brought within
their portice, at the &s;ame time all materials were preparing to run a mine
under their mo&s;t formidable ba&s;tion.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e operations intelligence was brought in
by our &s;couts, of a &s;econd corps of 1000 men being on their march. The
&s;ame zeal no longer animated the Indians; they complained of our thinne&s;s
of troops and their former lo&s;&s;es. I immediately called a council of the
chiefs; encouraged them as much as I could; promi&s;ed to lead them on
my&s;elf, and bring into the field 300 of the be&s;t troops. They li&s;tened to
this, and promi&s;ed to follow me, and agreed that I &s;hould recon|noitre the
ground propere&s;t for the field of battle the next morning, accompanied by
&s;ome of their chief warriors, to &s;ettle the plan of operations. When upon
the ground appointed for the field of battle, &s;couts came in with the account
of the fir&s;t number &s;welled to 2000; immediately after a third, that
General Burgoyne's army was cut to pieces, and that Arnold was advancing, by
rapid and forced marches, with 3000 men. It was at this moment I began to
&s;u&s;pect cowardice in &s;ome, and trea&s;on in others; however I returned to
camp, not without hopes, with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of my gallant coadjutor,
Sir John John&s;on, and the influence of the &s;uper|intending colonels, Claus
and Butler, of inducing them to meet the enemy. A council, according to their
cu&s;tom, was called, to know their re&s;olutions, before the breaking up of
which I learned that 200 were already decamped. In about an hour 
<PB N="xlvi" REF="192"> they in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould retreat, or they
would be obliged to abandon me. I had no other party to take, and a hard party
it was to troops who could do nothing without them, to yield to their
re&s;olves; and therefore propo&s;ed to retire at night, &s;ending on before my
&s;ick, wounded, artillery, &amp;c. down the Wood Creek, co|vering them by our
line of march.</P>
<P>This did not fall in with their views, which were no le&s;s than
treacherou&s;ly com|mitting ravage upon their friends, as they had lo&s;t the
opportunity of doing it upon their enemies. To effect this they artfully
cau&s;ed me&s;&s;engers to come in, one after the other, with accounts of the
nearer approaches of the rebels; one and the la&s;t affirmed that they were
within two miles of Captain Lernoult's po&s;t. Not giving entire credit to
this, and keeping to my re&s;olution of retiring by night, they grew furious
and abandoned; &s;eized upon the officers' liquor and cloaths, in &s;pite of
the efforts of their &s;ervants; and became more formidable than the enemy we
had to expect. I now thought it time to call in Captain Lernoult's po&s;t,
retiring with the troops in camp to the ruined fort called William, in the
front of the garri&s;on, not only to wait the enemy, if they thought proper to
&s;ally, but to pro|tect the boats from the fury of the &s;avages, having
&s;ent forward Captain Hoyes, with his detachment, with one piece of cannon, to
the place where Bull Fort &s;tood, to receive the troops who waited the arrival
of Captain Lernoult. Mo&s;t of the boats were e&s;corted that night beyond
Canada Creek, where no danger was to be apprehended from the enemy. The creek
at this place bending from the road, has a deep cedar &s;wamp between. Every
attention was now turned to the mouth of the creek, which the enemy might have
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of by a rapid march by the Oneyda Ca&s;tle. At
this place the whole of the little army arrived by twelve o'clock at night, and
took po&s;t in &s;uch a manner as to have no fears of any thing the enemy could
do. Here we remained till three o'clock next morning, when the boats which
could come up the Creek arrived, or rather that the ra&s;cally part of all
nations of the Indians would &s;uffer to come up; and proceeded acro&s;s Lake
Oneyda to the ruined fort of Brereton, where I learnt that &s;ome boats were
&s;till labouring down the creek, after being lightened of the be&s;t part of
their freight by the Me&s;&s;a&s;agoes. Captain Lernoult propo&s;ed, with a
boat full of armed men, to repa&s;s the lake that night, to relieve them from
their labour, and &s;upply them with provi&s;ion. This tran&s;action does as
much honour to the humanity as to the gallantry of this valuable officer.</P>
<P>On my arrival at the Onondago Falls I received an an&s;wer to my
letter from your Excellency, which &s;hewed, in the cleare&s;t light, the
&s;cenes of treachery that had been practi&s;ed upon me. The me&s;&s;enger had
heard indeed on his way that they were collecting the &s;ame kind of rabble as
before, but that there was not an enemy within forty miles of Fort Stanwix.</P>
<P>Soon after my arrival here I was joined by Captain Lernoult,
with the men and boats he had been in &s;earch of. I mean immediately to &s;end
off, for the u&s;e of the upper garri&s;on, all the overplus provi&s;ion I
&s;hall have, after keeping a &s;ufficiency to carry my detachment down, which
I mean to do with every expedition in my power the moment this bu&s;ine&s;s is
effected, for which purpo&s;e I have ordered here the &s;now. The &s;loop is
already gone from this with her full lading.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO po&s;&s;ibility of communication with your Lord&s;hip
having exi&s;ted &s;ince the beginning of September, at which time my la&s;t
di&s;patch was &s;ent away, I have to re|port to your Lord&s;hip the
proceedings of the army under my command from that period: a &s;eries of hard
toil, ince&s;&s;ant effort, &s;tubborn action; till di&s;abled in the
collateral branches of the army by the total defection of the Indians; the
de&s;ertion or timidity of the Canadians and Provincials, &s;ome individuals
excepted; di&s;appointed in the la&s;t hope of any timely co-operation from
other armies; the regular troops re|duced by lo&s;&s;es from the be&s;t part to
3500 fighting men, not 2000 of which were Briti&s;h; only three days
provi&s;ions upon &s;hort allowance in &s;tore; inve&s;ted by an army of 16,000
men, and no apparent means of retreat remaining, I called into council all the
generals, field officers, and captains commanding corps, and by their unanimous
concurrence and advice, I was induced to open a treaty with Major General
Gates.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip will &s;ee, by the papers tran&s;mitted
herewith, the di&s;agreeable pro|&s;pect which attended the fir&s;t overtures;
and when the terms concluded are compared, I tru&s;t that the &s;pirit of the
councils I have mentioned, which under &s;uch circum|&s;tances dictated
in&s;tead of &s;ubmitting, will not be refu&s;ed a &s;hare of credit.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon the detail of the&s;e events, I think it a
duty of ju&s;tice, my Lord, to take upon my&s;elf the mea&s;ure of having
pa&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on's River, in order to force a pa&s;&s;age to Albany. I
did not think my&s;elf authori&s;ed to call any men into council, when the
peremptory tenor of my orders and the &s;ea&s;on of the year admitted no
alternative.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ions for about thirty days having been brought
forward, the other nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores prepared, and the bridge of boats
completed, the army pa&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on's River on the 13th and 14th of
September, and incamped on the heights, and in the plain of Saratoga, the enemy
being then in the neighbourhood of Stillwater.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15th.</NOTE>The whole army made a movement
forward, and incamped in a good po&s;ition in a place called Dovacote.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">16th.</NOTE>It being found that there were
&s;everal bridges to repair, that work was begun under cover of &s;trong
detachments, and the &s;ame opportunity was taken to reconnoitre the
country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">17th.</NOTE>The army renewed their march,
repaired other bridges, and encamped upon ad|vantageous ground about four miles
from the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">18th.</NOTE>The enemy appeared in
con&s;iderable force to ob&s;truct the further repair of bridges, and with a
view, as it was conceived, to draw on an action where artillery could not 
<PB N="xlviii" REF="194"> be employed. A &s;mall lo&s;s was &s;u&s;tained in
&s;kirmi&s;hing, but the work of the bridges was effected.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 19.</NOTE>The pa&s;&s;ages of a great
ravine, and other roads towards the enemy, having been reconnoitred, the army
advanced in the following order.</P>
<P>Brigadier General Fra&s;er's corps, &s;u&s;tained by
Lieutenant Colonel Breyman's corps, made a circuit, in order to pa&s;s the
ravine commodiou&s;ly, without quitting the heights, and afterwards to cover
the march of the line to the right. The&s;e corps moved in three columns, and
had the Indians, Canadians, and Provincials upon their fronts and flanks. The
Briti&s;h line led by me in per&s;on pa&s;&s;ed the ravine in a direct line
&s;outh, and formed in order of battle as fa&s;t as they gained the &s;ummit,
where they waited to give time to Fra&s;er's corps to make the circuit, and to
enable the left wing and artillery, which, under the commands of Major General
Phillips, and Major General Reide&s;el, kept the great road and meadows near
the river in two columns, and had bridges to repair, to be equally ready to
proceed. The 47th regiment guarded the bateaux.</P>
<P>The &s;ignal guns, which had been previou&s;ly &s;ettled to
give notice of all the columns being ready to advance, having been fired
between one and two o'clock, the march continued. The &s;couts and flankers of
the column of the Briti&s;h line were &s;oon fired upon from &s;mall parties
but with no effect. After about an hour's march, the picquets, which made the
advanced guard of that column, were attacked in force, and obliged to give
ground, but they &s;oon rallied and were &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t opening of the wood I formed the troops. A few
cannon-&s;hot di&s;|lodged the enemy at a hou&s;e from whence the picquets had
been attacked, and Brigadier General Fra&s;er's corps had arrived with &s;uch
preci&s;ion in point of time, as to be found upon a very advantageous height on
the right of the Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>In the mean time the enemy, not acquainted with the
combination of the march, had moved in great force out of their intrenchments,
with a view of turning the line upon the right, and being checked by the
di&s;po&s;ition of Brigadier General Fra&s;er, counter|marched, in order to
direct their great effort to the left of the Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>From the nature of the country, movements of this &s;ort,
however near, may be effected without a po&s;&s;ibility of their being
di&s;covered.</P>
<P>About three o'clock the action began by a very vigorous attack
on the Briti&s;h line, and continued with great ob&s;tinacy till after
&s;un&s;et. The enemy being continually &s;upplied with fre&s;h troops, the
&s;tre&s;s lay upon the 20th, 21&s;t, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">2d regiments, mo&s;t parts of which
were engaged near four hours without intermi&s;&s;ion; the 9th had been ordered
early in the day to form in re&s;erve.</P>
<P>The grenadiers and 24th regiment were &s;ome part of the time
brought into action, as were part of the light infantry, and all the&s;e corps
charged with their u&s;ual &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The riflemen, and other parts of Breyman's corps, were al&s;o
of &s;ervice; but it was not thought advi&s;able to evacuate the heights where
Brigadier General Fra&s;er was po&s;ted otherwi&s;e than partially and
occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>Major General Phillips upon fir&s;t hearing the firing found
his way through a diffi|cult part of the wood to the &s;cene of action, and
brought up with him Major Williams and four pieces of artillery, and from that
moment I &s;tood indebted to that gallant and judicious &s;econd, for
ince&s;&s;ant and mo&s;t material &s;ervices, particularly for re&s;toring the
action in a point which was critically pre&s;&s;ed by a great &s;uperiority of
fire, and to which he led up the 20th regiment at the utmo&s;t per&s;onal
hazard.</P>
<P><PB N="xlix" REF="195"> Major-General Riede&s;el exerted
him&s;elf to bring up a part of the left wing, and arrived in time to charge
the enemy with regularity and bravery.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the light clo&s;ed, the enemy gave ground on all
&s;ides, and left us com|pletely ma&s;ters of the field of battle, with the
lo&s;s of about five hundred men on their &s;ide, and, as &s;uppo&s;ed, thrice
that number wounded.</P>
<P>The darkne&s;s preventing a pur&s;uit, the pri&s;oners were
few.</P>
<P>The behaviour of the officers and men in general was
exemplary. Brigadier-General Fra&s;er took his po&s;ition in the beginning of
the day with great judgment, and &s;u&s;tained the action with con&s;tant
pre&s;ence of mind and vigour. Brigadier-General Hamilton was the whole time
engaged and acquitted him&s;elf with great honour, ac|tivity and good
conduct.</P>
<P>The artillery in general was di&s;tingui&s;hed, and the
brigade under Captain Jones, who was killed in the action, was
con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;o.</P>
<P>The army lay upon their arms the night of the 19th, and the
next day took a po&s;ition nearly within cannon &s;hot of the enemy, fortifying
their right, and exten|ding their left to the brow of the heights, &s;o as to
cover the meadows through which the great river runs, and where their bateaux
and ho&s;pitals were placed. The 47th regiment, the regiment of He&s;&s;e
Hanau, and a corps of Provincials in|camped in the meadows as a further
&s;ecurity.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon found that no fruits, honour excepted, were
attained by the preceding victory, the enemy working with redoubled ardor to
&s;trengthen their left: their right was already unattackable.</P>
<P>On our &s;ide it became expedient to erect &s;trong redoubts
for the protection of the magazines and ho&s;pital, not only again&s;t a
&s;udden attack, but al&s;o for their &s;ecurity in ca&s;e of a march to turn
the enemy's flank.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">September 21.</NOTE>A me&s;&s;enger arrived
from Sir Harry Clinton with a letter in cypher, informing me of his intention
to attack Fort Montgomery in about ten days from the date of his letter, which
was the 12th in&s;tant. This was the only me&s;&s;enger of many that I
apprehend were di&s;patched by Sir William Howe, and him that had reached my
camp &s;ince the beginning of Augu&s;t. He was &s;ent back the &s;ame night to
in|form Sir Harry of my &s;ituation, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of a diver&s;ion
to oblige General Gates to detach from his army, and my intention to wait
favourable events in that po&s;ition, if po&s;&s;ible, to the 12th of
October.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the two following days, two officers in
di&s;gui&s;e, and other confi|dential per&s;ons, were di&s;patched by different
routes with verbal me&s;&s;ages to the &s;ame effect, and I continued
fortifying my camp and watching the enemy, who&s;e numbers increa&s;ed every
day.</P>
<P>I thought it advi&s;able on the 3d of October to dimini&s;h
the &s;oldiers' ration in order to lengthen out the provi&s;ions, to which
mea&s;ure the army &s;ubmitted with the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s. The
difficulties of a retreat to Canada were clearly fore&s;een, as was the
dilemma, &s;hould the retreat be effected, of leaving at liberty &s;uch an army
as General Gates's to operate again&s;t Sir William Howe.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration operated forcibly to determine me to
abide events as long as po&s;&s;ible, and I rea&s;oned thus. The expedition I
commanded was evidently meant at fir&s;t to be <HI>hazarded.</HI>
Circum&s;tances might require it &s;hould be <HI>devoted.</HI> A critical
junction of Mr. Gates's force with Mr. Wa&s;hington might po&s;&s;ibly decide
the fate <PB N="l" REF="196"> of the war; the failure of my junction with Sir
Harry Clinton, or the lo&s;s of my retreat to Canada could only be a partial
misfortune.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation things continued till the &s;eventh, when
no intelligence having been received of the expected co-operation, and four or
five days for our limited &s;tay in the camp only remained, it was judged
advi&s;able to make a movement to the enemy's left, not only to di&s;cover
whether there were any po&s;&s;ible means of forcing a pa&s;&s;age &s;hould it
be nece&s;&s;ary to advance, or of di&s;lodging him for the convenience of a
retreat, but al&s;o to cover a forage of the army which was in the greate&s;t
di&s;tre&s;s on accouut of the &s;carcity.</P>
<P>A detachment of fifteen hundred regular troops with two twelve
pounders, two howitzers, and &s;ix &s;ix-pounders, were ordered to move, and
were commanded by my&s;elf, having with me Major-General Phillips,
Major-General Reide&s;el, and Brigadier-General Fra&s;er.</P>
<P>The guard of the camp upon the heights was left to
Brigadier-General Hamilton and Specht, the redoubts and the plain to Brigadier
General Gall; and as the force of the enemy immediately in their front
con&s;i&s;ted of more than double their num|bers, it was not po&s;&s;ible to
augment the corps that marched, beyond the numbers above &s;tated.</P>
<P>I formed the troops within three-quarters of a mile of the
enemy's left, and Captain Fra&s;er's rangers, with Indians and Provincials, had
orders to go by &s;ecret paths in the woods to gain the enemy's rear, and by
&s;hewing them&s;elves there to keep them in a check.</P>
<P>The further operations intended, were prevented by a very
&s;udden and rapid attack of the enemy on our left, where the Briti&s;h
grenadiers were po&s;ted to &s;upport the left wing of the line. Major Acland
at the head of them &s;u&s;tained the attack with great re&s;olution; but the
enemy's great numbers enabling them in a few minutes to extend the attack along
the front of the Germans, which were immediately on the right of the
grenadiers, no part of that body could be removed to make a &s;econd line to
the flank, where the &s;tre&s;s of the fire lay. The right was at this time
en|gaged, but it was &s;oon ob&s;erved that the enemy were marching a large
corps round their flank to endeavour cutting off their retreat. The light
infantry and part of the 24th regiment which were at that po&s;t were therefore
ordered to form a &s;econd line, and to &s;ecure the return of the troops into
camp. While this movement was pro|ceeding the enemy pu&s;hed a fre&s;h and
&s;trong reinforcement to renew the action upon the left, which, overpowered by
a great &s;uperiority, gave way, and the light in|fantry and 24th regiment were
obliged to make a quick movement to &s;ave that point from being entirely
carried, in doing which, Brigadier-General Fra&s;er was mortally wounded.</P>
<P>The danger to which the lines were expo&s;ed becoming at this
moment of the mo&s;t &s;erious nature, orders were given to Major-General
Phillips and Reide&s;el to cover the retreat, while &s;uch troops as were
mo&s;t ready for the purpo&s;e, returned for the defence of them. The troops
retreated hard pre&s;&s;ed, but in good order; they were obliged to leave &s;ix
pieces of cannon, all the hor&s;es having been killed, and mo&s;t of the
artillery-men, who had behaved as u&s;ual with the utmo&s;t bravery under the
command of Major Williams, being either killed or wounded.</P>
<P>The troops had &s;carcely entered the camp when it was
&s;tormed with great fury, the enemy ru&s;hing to the lines under a &s;evere
fire of grape-&s;hot and &s;mall arms. <PB N="li" REF="197"> The po&s;t of the
light infantry under Lord Balcarras a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome of the line, which
threw them&s;elves by order into the intrenchments, was defended with great
&s;pirit, and the enemy led on by General Arnold was finally repul&s;ed, and
the General wounded; but unhappily the intrenchments of the German re&s;erve,
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Breymann, who was killed, were carried, and
although ordered to be recovered, they never were &s;o, and the enemy by that
misfortune gained an opening on our right and rear. The night put an end to the
action.</P>
<P>Under the di&s;advantages thus apparent in our &s;ituation,
the army was ordered to quit the pre&s;ent po&s;ition during the night and take
po&s;t upon the heights above the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Thus by an entire change of front, to reduce the enemy to form
a new di&s;po&s;ition. This movement was effected in great order and without
lo&s;s, though all the artillery and camp were removed at the &s;ame time. The
army continued offering battle to the enemy in their new po&s;ition the whole
day of the 8th.</P>
<P>Intelligence was now received that the enemy were marching to
turn the right, and no means could prevent that mea&s;ure but retiring towards
Saratoga. The army began to move at nine o'clock at night, Major-General
Reide&s;el commanding the van-guard, and Major-General Phillips the rear.</P>
<P>This retreat, though within mu&s;quet-&s;hot of the enemy, and
encumbered with all the baggage of the army, was made without lo&s;s, but a
very heavy rain and the difficulties of guarding the bateaux which contained
all the provi&s;ions, occa&s;ioned delays which prevented the army reaching
Saratoga till the night of the 9th, and the artillery could not pa&s;s the
fords of the Fi&s;h-kill till the morning of the 10th.</P>
<P>At our arrival near Saratoga, a corps of the enemy, between
five and &s;ix hundred, were di&s;covered throwing up intrenchments on the
heights, but retired over a ford of the Hud&s;on's River at our approach, and
joined a body po&s;ted to oppo&s;e our pa&s;&s;age there.</P>
<P>It was judged proper to &s;end a detachment of artificers
under a &s;trong e&s;cort to re|pair the bridges and open a road to Fort-Edward
on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river. The 47th regiment, Captain Fra&s;er's
mark&s;men, and Mackoy's Provincials, were ordered for that &s;ervice, but the
enemy appearing on the heights of the Fi&s;h-kill in great force, and making a
di&s;po&s;ition to pa&s;s and give us battle: the 47th regiment and Fra&s;er's
mark&s;men were recalled; the Provincials left to cover the workmen at the
fir&s;t bridge run away upon a very &s;light attack of a &s;mall party of the
enemy, and left the artificers to e&s;cape as they could, without a
po&s;&s;ibility of their performing any work.</P>
<P>During the&s;e different movements the bateaux with
provi&s;ions were frequently fired upon from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the
river, and &s;ome of them were lo&s;t, and &s;everal men were killed and
wounded in tho&s;e which remained.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">October 11.</NOTE>The attacks upon the
bateaux were continued, &s;everal were taken and retaken, but their &s;ituation
being much nearer to the main force of the enemy than to ours, it was found
impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ecure the provi&s;ions any otherwi&s;e than by landing
them and carrying them upon the hill: this was effected under fire, and with
great difficulty.</P>
<P>The po&s;&s;ible means of further retreat were now
con&s;idered in councils of war, compo&s;ed of the general officers, minutes of
which will be tran&s;mitted to your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="lii" REF="198"> The only one that &s;eemed at all
practicable was, by a night march to gain Fort-Edward with the troops carrying
their provi&s;ion upon their backs; the impo&s;&s;ibility of repairing bridges,
putting a conveyance of artillery and carriages out of the que&s;tion, it was
propo&s;ed to force the ford at Fort-Edward, or the ford above it. Before this
attempt could be made, &s;couts returned with intelligence that the enemy were
intrenched oppo&s;ite the&s;e fords, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a camp in force on
the high ground between Fort-Edward and Fort-George with cannon. They had
al&s;o parties down the whole &s;hore to watch our motions, and po&s;ts &s;o
near to us, upon our own &s;ide of the water as mu&s;t prevent the army moving
a &s;ingle mile undi&s;covered.</P>
<P>The bulk of the enemy's army was hourly joined by new corps of
militia and vo|lunteers, and their numbers together amounted to upwards of
16,000 men. Their po&s;ition, which extended three parts in four of a circle
round us, was from the nature of the ground unattackable in all parts.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation the army took the be&s;t po&s;ition
po&s;&s;ible and fortified, waiting till the 13th at night, in the anxious hope
of &s;uccours from our friends, or the next de&s;irable expectation, an attack
from our enemy.</P>
<P>During this time the men lay continually upon their arms, and
were cannonaded in every part, even rifle-&s;hot and grape-&s;hot came into all
parts of the line, though with|out any con&s;iderable effect.</P>
<P>At this period an exact account of the provi&s;ions was taken,
and the circum&s;tances &s;tated in the opening of this letter became
compleat.</P>
<P>The council of war was extended to all the field officers and
captains commanding corps of the army, and the event en&s;ued which I am &s;ure
was inevitable, and which, I tru&s;t, in that &s;ituation was honourable, but
which it would be &s;uperfluous and melan|choly to repeat.</P>
<P>After the execution of the treaty, General Gates drew together
the force that had &s;urrounded my po&s;ition, and I had the con&s;olation to
have as many witne&s;&s;es as I have men under my command, of its amounting to
the numbers mentioned above.</P>
<P>During the events &s;tated above, an attempt was made
again&s;t Ticonderoga by an army a&s;&s;embled under Major General Lincoln, who
found means to march with a con|&s;iderable corps from Huberton undi&s;covered,
while another column of his force pa&s;&s;ed the mountains between
Skene&s;borough and Lake George, and on the morning of the 18th of September a
&s;udden and general attack was made upon the carrying place at Lake George,
Sugar Hill, Ticonderoga, and Mount Independence. The &s;ea officers commanding
the armed &s;loop &s;tationed to defend the carrying place, as al&s;o &s;ome of
the officers commanding at the po&s;ts of Sugar Hill and at the Portage were
&s;urpri&s;ed, and a con&s;iderable part of four companies of the 53d regiment
were made pri&s;oners; a block-hou&s;e, commanded by Lieutenant Lord of the
53d, was the only po&s;t on that &s;ide that had time to make u&s;e of their
arms, and they made a brave defence till cannon taken from the &s;urpri&s;ed
ve&s;&s;el was brought again&s;t them.</P>
<P>After &s;tating and lamenting &s;o fatal a want of vigilance,
I have to inform your Lord&s;hip of the &s;atisfactory events which
followed.</P>
<P>The enemy having twice &s;ummoned Brigadier General Powell,
and received &s;uch an&s;wer as became a gallant officer entru&s;ted with &s;o
important a po&s;t, and having tried during the cour&s;e of four days &s;everal
attacks, and being repul&s;ed in all, retreated without having done any
con&s;iderable damage.</P>
<P>Brigadier General Powell, from who&s;e report to me I extract
this relation, gives great commendations to the regiment of Prince Frederick,
and the other troops &s;ta|tioned <PB N="liii" REF="199"> at Mount
Independence. The Brigadier al&s;o mentions with great applau&s;e the behaviour
of Captain Taylor of the 21&s;t regiment, who was accidentally there on his
route to the army from the ho&s;pital, and Lieutenant Beecroft of the 24th
regiment, who with the artificers in arms defended an important battery.</P>
<P>On the 24th in&s;tant, the enemy, enabled by the capture of
the gun-boats and ba|teaux which they had made after the &s;urpri&s;e of the
&s;loop, to embark upon Lake George, attacked Diamond I&s;land in two
divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Captain Aubrey and two companies of the 47th regiment, had
been po&s;ted at that i&s;land from the time the army pa&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on's
River, as a better &s;ituation for the &s;ecurity of the &s;tores at the
&s;outh end of Lake George than Fort George, which is on the continent, and not
tenable again&s;t artillery and numbers, The enemy were re|pul&s;ed by Captain
Aubrey with great lo&s;s, and pur&s;ued by the gun-boats under his command to
the ea&s;t &s;hore, where two of their principal ve&s;&s;els were retaken,
together with all the cannon. They had ju&s;t time to &s;et fire to the other
bateaux, and retreated over the mountains.</P>
<P>I beg leave to refer your Lord&s;hip for further particulars
to my aid-de-camp, Lord Peter&s;ham, and I humbly take occa&s;ion to recommend
to his Maje&s;ty's notice that no|bleman, as one endued with qualities to do
important &s;ervices to his country in every &s;tation to which his birth may
lead. In this late campaign in particular, his beha|viour has been &s;uch as to
entitle him to the fulle&s;t applau&s;e, and I am confident his merit will be
thought a &s;ufficient ground for preferment, though deprived of the
<HI>eclat</HI> and &s;ort of claim which generally attends the delivery of
fortunate di&s;patches.</P>
<P>I have only to add, my Lord, a general report of the killed
and wounded; I do not give it correct, the hurry of the time and the
&s;eparation of the corps having ren|dered it impo&s;&s;ible to make it &s;o.
The Briti&s;h officers have bled profu&s;ely and mo&s;t honourably; tho&s;e who
remain unwounded have been equally forward, and the gene|ral officers from the
mode of fighting have been more expo&s;ed than in other &s;ervices. Among the
re&s;t of this &s;tation, I have had my e&s;capes. It depends upon the
&s;entence his Maje&s;ty &s;hall pa&s;s upon my conduct; upon the judgment of
my profe&s;&s;ion, and of the impartial and re&s;pectable parts of my country,
whether I am to e&s;teem them ble&s;|&s;ings or misfortunes.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>[Private, by Lord <HI>Peter&s;ham.</HI>]</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE little to add to my public letter re&s;pecting the
cour&s;e of un&s;ucce&s;sful events, therein detailed. I re&s;t my confidence
in the ju&s;tice of the King and his councils, to &s;upport the General they
thought proper to appoint to as arduous an un|dertaking, and under as
po&s;itive a direction, as perhaps a cabinet ever framed. It will, I am &s;ure,
be remembered, my Lord, that a preference of exertions was the only latitude
given me, and that to force a junction with Sir William Howe, or at lea&s;t a
pa&s;&s;age to Albany, was the principle, the letter, and the &s;pirit of my
orders.</P>
<P><PB N="liv" REF="200"> Indeed the appearances at the time I
pa&s;&s;ed the Hud&s;on's-River, though &s;ubject to doubt in &s;ome
in&s;tances, as I then wrote your Lord&s;hip, were upon a general view, &s;uch
as I am per&s;uaded would have rendered inaction cen&s;urable, had my orders,
in&s;tead of being peremptory, been di&s;cretionary. Promi&s;es of the
profe&s;&s;ing loyali&s;ts were not then brought to the te&s;t; the &s;pirit of
the enemy, in combat again&s;t regular Briti&s;h troops, had only been tried at
Ticonderago, at Huberton, at Skene&s;borough, and Fort Anne; in all which
places it had failed; the total di&s;appointment of effectual co-operation,
could not be fore&s;een or &s;uppo&s;ed; and &s;ure I am, had I then made
&s;uppo|&s;ition that any thing like what has happened, might have happened,
and remained cautiou&s;ly po&s;ted, no exertion attempted, my conduct would
have been held indefen|&s;ible by every cla&s;s and di&s;tinction of men in
government, in the army, and in the public.</P>
<P>The expediency of advancing being admitted, the con&s;equences
have been honou|rable misfortunes. The Briti&s;h have per&s;evered in a
&s;trenuous and bloody pro|gre&s;s. Had the force been all Briti&s;h, perhaps
the per&s;everance had been longer; but as it was, will it be &s;aid, my Lord,
that in the exhau&s;ted &s;ituation de&s;cribed, and in the jaws of famine, and
inve&s;ted by quadruple numbers, a treaty which &s;aves the army to the
&s;tate, for the next campaign, was not more than could have been expected? I I
call it &s;aving the army, becau&s;e if &s;ent home, the &s;tate is thereby
enabled to &s;end forth the troops now de&s;tined for her internal defence; if
exchanged, they become a force to Sir William Howe, as effectually, as if any
other junction had been made.</P>
<P>I &s;hould now hold my&s;elf unju&s;tifiable if I did not
confide to your Lord&s;hip, my opinion, upon a near in&s;pection, of the rebel
troops. The &s;tanding corps which I have &s;een, are di&s;ciplined. I do not
hazard the term, but apply it to the great funda|mental points of military
in&s;titution, &s;obriety, &s;ubordination, regularity and courage. The militia
are inferior in method and movement, but not a jot le&s;s &s;erviceable in
woods. My conjectures were very different after the affair of Ticonderago, but
I am convinced they were delu&s;ive; and it is a duty to the &s;tate to
confe&s;s it.</P>
<P>The panic of the rebel troops is confined, and of &s;hort
duration; the enthu&s;ia&s;im is exten&s;ive and permanent.</P>
<P>It is a ju&s;tice to Major General Phillips, to inform your
Lord&s;hip, that when the cri&s;is of our &s;ituation at Saratoga arrived, he
very hand&s;omely offered to hazard his per&s;on by making a circuit through
the woods, and attempt to throw him&s;elf into Ticondera|go, to defend that
place, &s;hould it be the object of the enemy to endeavour the re|taking
it.</P>
<P>In regard to my&s;elf, I am &s;unk in mind and body; but while
I have a faculty of either, it &s;hall be exerted for the King's &s;ervice. I
&s;hall wait in the neighbourhood of Bo&s;ton, the orders of Sir William
Howe.</P>

<ITEM>Lieutenant General BURGOYNE,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Major General REIDESEL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Major General PHILIPS,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Brigadier General HAMILTON.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THE Lieutenant General &s;tates to the council the pre&s;ent
&s;ituation of affairs.</P>
<P>The enemy in force, according to the be&s;t intelligence he can
obtain, to the amount of upwards of 14,000 men, and a con&s;iderable quantity
of artillery, are on this &s;ide the Fi&s;h-kill, and threaten an attack. On
the other &s;ide the Hud&s;on's River, between this army and Fort Edward, is
another army of the enemy, the numbers unknown; but one corps, which there has
been an opportunity of ob&s;erving, is reported to be about 1500 men. They have
likewi&s;e cannon on the other &s;ide the Hud&s;on's River, and they have a
bridge below Saratoga church, by which the two armies can communi|cate.</P>
<P>The bateaux of the army have been de&s;troyed, and no means
appear of making a bridge over the Hud&s;on's River, were it even practicable
from the po&s;ition of the enemy.</P>
<P>The only means of retreat, therefore, are by the ford at Fort
Edward, or taking the mountains in order to pa&s;s the river higher up by
rafts, or by any other ford which is reported to be practicable with
difficulty, or by keeping the mountains, to pa&s;s the head of Hud&s;on's
River, and continue to the we&s;tward of Lake George all the way to
Ticonderoga; it is true, this la&s;t pa&s;&s;age was never made but by Indians,
or very &s;mall bodies of men.</P>
<P>In order to pa&s;s cannon or any wheel carriages from hence to
Fort Edward, &s;ome bridges mu&s;t be repaired under fire of the enemy from the
oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, and the principal bridge will be a work of
fourteen or fifteen hours; there is no good po&s;ition for the army to take to
&s;u&s;tain that work, and if there were, the time &s;tated as nece&s;&s;ary,
would give the enemy on the other &s;ide the Hud&s;on's River an opportunity to
take po&s;t on the &s;trong ground above Fort Edward, or to di&s;pute the ford
while General Gates's army followed in the rear.</P>
<P>The intelligence from the lower part of Hud&s;on's River is
founded upon the con|current reports of pri&s;oners and de&s;erters, who &s;ay
it was the news in the enemy's camp, that Fort Montgomery was taken; and one
man, a friend to government, who ar|rived ye&s;terday, mentions &s;ome
particulars of the manner in which it was taken.</P>
<P>The provi&s;ions of the army may hold out to the 20th; there is
neither rum nor &s;pruce beer.</P>
<P>Having committed this &s;tate of facts to the con&s;ideration of
the council, the Gene|ral reque&s;ts their &s;entiments on the following
propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>1&s;t. To wait in the pre&s;ent po&s;ition an attack from the
enemy, or the chance of fa|vourable events.</P>
<P>2d. To attack the enemy.</P>
<P>3d. To retreat repairing the bridges as the army moves for the
artillery, in order to force the pa&s;&s;age of the ford.</P>
<P>4th. To retreat by night, leaving the artillery and the baggage;
and &s;hould it be found impracticable to force the pa&s;&s;age with

their left, leave their rear open, to march rapidly for Albany.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t propo&s;ition re&s;olved, that the &s;ituation
would grow wor&s;e by de|lay, that the provi&s;ion now in &s;tore not more than
&s;ufficient for the retreat, &s;hould impediments intervene, or a circuit of
country become nece&s;&s;ary; and as the enemy did not attack when the ground
was unfortified, it is not probable they will do it now, as they have a better
game to play.</P>
<P>The &s;econd unadvi&s;able and de&s;perate, there being no
po&s;&s;ibility of reconnoi|tering the enemy's po&s;ition, and his great
&s;uperiority of numbers known.</P>
<P>The third impracticable.</P>
<P>The fifth thought worthy of con&s;ideration by the
Lieutenant-General, Major-General Phillips, and Brigadier-General Hamilton; but
the po&s;ition of the enemy yet gives no opening for it.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, that the fourth propo&s;ition is the only
re&s;ource, and that to effect it, the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy and &s;ilence is to
be ob&s;erved; and the troops are to be put in motion from the right in the
&s;till part of the night, without any change in the di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>N. B. It depended upon the delivery of &s;ix days provi&s;ion in
due time, and upon the return of &s;couts, who had been &s;ent forward to
examine by what route the army could probably move the fir&s;t four miles
undi&s;covered, whether the plan &s;hould take place on that day, or on the
morrow.</P>
<P>The &s;couts on their return reported, that the enemy's
po&s;ition on the right was &s;uch, and they had &s;o many &s;mall parties out,
that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to move without our march being immediately
di&s;covered.</P>

<HEAD>Minutes and Proceedings of a Council of War, con&s;i&s;ting
of all the general Officers and Field Officers, and Captains commanding Corps,
on the Heights of <HI>Saratoga, October</HI> 13.</HEAD>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<P>THE Lieutenant-General having explained the &s;ituation of
affairs, as in the pre|ceding council, with the additional intelligence, that
the enemy was intrenched at the fords of Fort Edward, and likewi&s;e occupied
the &s;trong po&s;ition on the Pine|plains between Fort George and Fort Edward,
expre&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s to undertake at their head any enterpri&s;e of
difficulty or hazard that &s;hould appear to them within the compa&s;s of their
&s;trength of &s;pirit. He added, that he had rea&s;on to believe a
capitulation had been in the contemplation of &s;ome, perhaps of all, who knew
the real &s;ituation of things; that upon a circum&s;tance of &s;uch
con&s;equence to national and per&s;onal honour, he thought it a duty to his
country, and to him&s;elf, to extend his council beyond the u&s;ual limits;
that the a&s;&s;embly pre&s;ent might ju&s;tly be e&s;teemed a full
repre&s;entation of the army; and that he &s;hould think him&s;elf
unju&s;ti|fiable in taking any &s;tep in &s;o &s;erious a matter, without
&s;uch a concurrence of &s;enti|ments as &s;hould make a treaty the act of the
army, as well as that of the general.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion therefore he de&s;ired them to decide
was, Whether an army of 3500 fighting men, and well provided with artillery,
were ju&s;tifiable, upon the principles of national dignity and military
honour, in capitulating in any po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation?</P>
<P><PB N="lvii" REF="203"> Re&s;olved, nem. con. in the
affirmative.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion 2. Is the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of that nature?</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, nem. con. That the pre&s;ent &s;ituation
ju&s;tifies a capitulation upon ho|nourable terms.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant-General then drew up the me&s;&s;age, marked
No. 2, and laid it before the council. It was unanimou&s;ly approved, and upon
that foundation the treaty opened.</P>
<P>October 14. Major King&s;ton having delivered the me&s;&s;age
marked No. 2. return|ed with the propo&s;als marked No. 3, and the council of
war being a&s;&s;embled again, the Lieutenant-General laid the propo&s;als
before them, when it was re&s;olved unani|mou&s;ly to reject the 6th article,
and not to admit of it in any extremity whatever.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant-General then laid before the council the
an&s;wers to Major-General Gates's propo&s;als, as marked in the &s;ame paper,
together with his own preliminary propo&s;als, which were unanimou&s;ly
approved of.</P>
<P>October 15. The council being a&s;&s;embled again,
Major-General Gates's an&s;wers to Lieutenant-General Burgoyne's propo&s;als
were laid before them, whereupon it was re&s;olved, that they were
&s;atisfactory, and a &s;ufficient ground for proceeding to a definitive
treaty.</P>

<HEAD>No. 2. Major <HI>King&s;ton</HI> delivered the following
Me&s;&s;age to Major-General <HI>Gates, October</HI> 14.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having fought you twice, Lieutenant-General Burgoyne has
waited &s;ome days, in his pre&s;ent po&s;ition, determined to try a third
conflict again&s;t any force you could bring to attack him.</P>
<P>He is appri&s;ed of the &s;uperiority of your numbers, and the
di&s;po&s;ition of your troops to impede his &s;upplies, and render his retreat
a &s;cene of carnage on both &s;ides. In this &s;ituation he is impelled by
humanity, and thinks him&s;elf ju&s;tifiable by e&s;tabli&s;hed principles and
precedents of &s;tate, and of war, to &s;pare the lives of brave men upon
honourable terms. Should Major-General Gates be inclined to treat upon that
idea, General Burgoyne would propo&s;e a ce&s;&s;ation of arms during the time
nece&s;&s;ary to communicate the preliminary terms by which, in any extre|mity,
he and his army mean to abide.</P>

<P N="1">I. General Burgoyne's army being exceedingly
reduced by repeated defeats, by de&s;ertion, &s;ickne&s;s, &amp;c. their
provi&s;ions exhau&s;ted, their military hor&s;es, tents, and baggage, taken or
de&s;troyed, their retreat cut off, and their camp inve&s;ted, they can only be
allowed to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. Lieutenant-General Burgoyne's army, however
reduced, will never admit that their retreat is cut off, while they have arms
in their hands.</P>
<P N="2">II. The officers and &s;oldiers may keep the
baggage belonging to them. The generals of the United States never permit
individuals to be pillaged.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="lviii" REF="204"> III. The troops under
his Excellency General Burgoyne will be conducted by the mo&s;t convenient
route to New England, marching by ea&s;y marches, and &s;uf|ficiently provided
for by the way.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. This article is an&s;wered by General
Burgoyne's fir&s;t propo&s;al, which is here annexed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The officers will be admitted on parole; may
wear their &s;ide-arms, and will be treated with the liberality cu&s;tomary in
Europe, &s;o long as they, by proper behaviour, continue to de&s;erve it; but
tho&s;e who are apprehended having broke their parole, as &s;ome Briti&s;h
officers have done, mu&s;t expect to be clo&s;e confined.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. There being no officer in this army under,
or capable of being under the de&s;cription of breaking parole, this article
needs no an&s;wer.</P>
<P N="5">V. All public &s;tores, artillery, arms,
ammunition, carriages, hor&s;es, &amp;c. &amp;c. mu&s;t be delivered to
commi&s;&s;aries appointed to receive them.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. All public &s;tores may be delivered, arms
excepted.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The&s;e terms being agreed to and &s;igned,
the troops under his Excellency General Burgoyne's command may be drawn up in
their encampments, where they will be ordered to ground their arms, and may
thereupon be marched to the river &s;ide, to be pa&s;&s;ed over in their way
towards Bennington.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. This article inadmi&s;&s;ible in any
extremity. Sooner than this army will con&s;ent to ground their arms in their
encampment, they will ru&s;h on the enemy, determined to take no quarter.</P>

<P>QUESTION.</P>
<P>General Gates having, in an&s;wer to General Burgoyne's
me&s;&s;age, given a &s;olemn affirmation on his honour, that no detachment has
been made from his army during the negociation of the treaty, is the treaty, in
its pre&s;ent &s;ituation, binding on this army, or is the general's honour
engaged for the &s;igning it?</P>
<P>[Here follow the names of the officers as they voted.]</P>
<P>The lieutenant general's opinion being clear, that he is not bound
by what has pa&s;&s;ed, he would not execute the treaty upon the &s;ole
con&s;ideration of the point of honour, notwith&s;tanding the re&s;pectable
majority again&s;t him.</P>
<P>He is likewi&s;e far from being convinced that this army, by great
exertions and by great enduring in point of provi&s;ions, might not yet be
relieved; but he is com|pelled to yield on the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>The treaty was generally thought a mo&s;t advantageous one before
the intelligence arrived. That intelligence is refuted, and ocular
demon&s;tration of its fal&s;ity pledged as far as relates to General Gates's
force; the other parts are only founded on hear&s;ay, and not to be depended

<P>Should General Clinton be where reported, yet the di&s;tance is
&s;uch as to render any relief from him improbable during the time our
provi&s;ions could be made to la&s;t.</P>
<P>&mdash;declares his po&s;t untenable, and &s;ays, if this
convention is not &s;igned, he apprehends there will be con&s;iderable
de&s;ertion.</P>
<P>&mdash;&s;ays he thinks the 47th regiment not to be depended
on.</P>
<P>&mdash;is of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>&mdash;thinks the 62d regiment is di&s;heartened by the
&s;ituation of their po&s;t, and not equal to their former exertions.</P>
<P>Several officers think the men in general &s;eem to have got the
convention in their heads as de&s;irable.</P>
<P>Many of the be&s;t officers are ab&s;ent by &s;ickne&s;s and
wounds from all the corps.</P>
<P>Though the other officers at the head of the Briti&s;h corps think
they can an&s;wer for the &s;pirit of their men, if attacked on their pre&s;ent
ground, it is evident the mo&s;t &s;anguine do not think any part of the army
in that elevation and alacrity of &s;pirit ne|ce&s;&s;ary for undertaking
de&s;perate enterprizes.</P>
<P>To break off the treaty now renders a future renewal of it
hopele&s;s, as our condi|tion mu&s;t every hour grow wor&s;e.</P>
<P>A defeat is fatal to the army. A victory does not &s;ave it, as
they have neither provi&s;ions to advance nor retreat again&s;t an enemy who by
experience we know are capable of rallying at every advantageous po&s;t.</P>
<P>And that the life and property of every provincial and dependant
of this army depends upon the execution of this treaty.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Major General <HI>Phillips,</HI> to
Lieutenant General <HI>Burgoyne,</HI> dated <HI>Cambridge, September</HI> 29,
1778.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Bo&s;ton news papers, have given extracts from Engli&s;h and
New York papers, wherein you are mentioned; your arrival, your &s;peeches in
parliament; and a variety of other matters concerning you. I do not always give
credit to news papers, and therefore, the publi&s;hers at Bo&s;ton will
excu&s;e me, if in the in|&s;tance of news I do not give them, in my opinion,
more veracity than I allow the news compilers at London.</P>
<P>I will not plague you about our &s;ituation, as you will know
it, by my a&s;&s;uring you it is almo&s;t exactly as you left us; &s;o no more
about it. The troops here de|pend upon you their chief, in whatever may relate
to them; their intere&s;t; their honour. It is not doubted but you will exert
your&s;elf, that the officers may gain preferment in common, with other parts
of the army. That you will have the goodne&s;s to exert your&s;elf in behalf of
their &s;ituation, re&s;pecting the very great expence of living, and endeavour
to procure the allowance of forage money. And in &s;hort, that you will u&s;e
all your powers of per&s;ua&s;ion and intere&s;t for the&s;e troops, which have
&s;erved under you with zeal, and with honour; and endeavour, by &s;erving
their &s;ituation and promoting their honour, to alleviate misfortunes which
nor fortitude nor valour could prevent, and which they &s;uffer, however, with
re&s;ignation and patience. I am mo&s;t perfectly convinced of your
affectionate, I will &s;ay your grateful regard for us all; and I leave
my&s;elf and the troops to your friendly care; to your humanity; to your
honour.</P>
<P>You cannot expect a letter of entertainment; I have not even a
power of making it one of intelligence. It &s;hall be however, a letter of
perfect &s;incerity, and in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of it I profe&s;s to
be,</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Lieutenant General <HI>Burgoyne</HI> to
Lord <HI>Amher&s;t,</HI> inclo&s;ing the Memorial referred to in the above,
dated <HI>November</HI> 6, 1778.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE heavy misfortune I &s;u&s;tain in being precluded the King's
pre&s;ence, touches me in no point more nearly, than in the prevention of doing
ju&s;tice to the various and exten&s;ive merits of the army I had the honour to
command. That the con|&s;equences of my &s;uppo&s;ed, or real errors, &s;hould
involve preten&s;ions and intere&s;ts of &s;o many gallant officers is a
painful reflection; and it can only be alleviated by the true&s;t &s;en&s;e of
the tru&s;t to be repo&s;ed in your Lord&s;hip, for the general protec|tion of
the &s;ervice. The inclo&s;ed memorial was accompanied with expre&s;&s;ions of
reliance, in the name of the whole army, upon my efforts to &s;upport it. The
officers in New England little conceive my pre&s;ent &s;ituation: I take the
fir&s;t oppor|tunity to tran&s;mit their cau&s;e to your Lord&s;hip's happier
au&s;pices, with this &s;olemn declaration, which I have mentioned upon
different public occa&s;ions, and which I can omit no occa&s;ion to repeat,
that there is not a Briti&s;h officer who &s;erved under me during the campaign
of 1777, to whom I can impute blame; that the in&s;tances are very numerous
wherein particular di&s;tinction is due; and as a body, they have a claim to my
&s;incere&s;t re&s;pect for their zeal in the King's &s;ervice, and to my
utmo&s;t gratitude for their attention to me per&s;onally.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>In Plan IV. the third and fourth po&s;itions of the army in the
engagement of 19th of September may appear upon a cur&s;ory view to want
preci&s;ion. The ine|qualities of the ground could not be di&s;tinctly marked
upon &s;o &s;mall a &s;cale; and the continual &s;hift of the po&s;itions of
&s;eparate corps, as they were attacked by corps of the enemy, which
frequently, from the thickne&s;s of the wood, they did not &s;ee, made it
equally difficult to mark regularly the po&s;ition of the whole at any one
time.</P>
<P>The po&s;ition of the armies on the 8th of September in Plate V.
requires al&s;o &s;ome explanation. From the &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;cale, the
po&s;ition of the enemy could only be &s;hewn upon the plain near the river;
but it is to be ob&s;erved, it extended over the ground of General Burgoyne's
former encampment, and in front of the redoubts upon the hill.</P>
