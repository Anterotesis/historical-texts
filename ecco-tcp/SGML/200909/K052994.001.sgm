<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_TO improve the Under&s;tanding in any Branch of u&s;eful Knowledge, has ever been e&s;teemed a laudable Pur|&s;uit; and every Attempt to facilitate the Propagation of Knowledge, in Proportion to the Nature and Importance of the Subject, and the Propriety of the Method, will, it is pre&s;umed, meet with Approbation and En|couragement.</P>
<P>To obtain a Skill in the Sciences is, indeed, the Bu&s;ine&s;s and Profe&s;&s;ion only of a few Men of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Abilities; but there are many who have Capacity and Lei&s;ure to improve and enrich their Minds in various Branches of Knowledge; even the lower Order of Men have particular Callings and Concerns in Life, in which it behoves them to employ their Rea&s;on in the U&s;e of proper Helps for their Improvement.</P>
<P>The common Duties and Benefits of Society, which intere&s;t every Man living, as he is a &s;ocial Creature; even our particular and nece&s;&s;ary Rela|tions to a Family, a Neighbourhood, or Govern|ment, oblige all Per&s;ons to exerci&s;e their rea&s;oning Powers in a Variety of Ca&s;es, before they can come
<PB N="iv" REF="3">to a prudent di&s;creet Determination, and avoid tho&s;e Errors which would naturally be attended with unhappy Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>But every Man has a more important Concern in the Affairs of a Life to come; and therefore it is a Matter of the highe&s;t Moment for every one to under&s;tand, to rea&s;on, and to determine ju&s;tly about the Things of Religion: 'Tis in vain for Per|&s;ons in general to &s;ay, We have no Lei&s;ure or Time; when the daily Intervals and Vacancies from nece&s;|&s;ary Labour, together with the One Day in Seven, in the Chri&s;tian World, allow a &s;ufficient Time for &s;uch Pur&s;uits: And if Men would but apply them&s;elves hereto, with half as much Zeal and Di|ligence as they do to the Trifles and Amu&s;ements of this Life, it would turn to infinitely better Account.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the right Knowledge of tho&s;e Princi|ples and Duties which are of the greate&s;t Concern|ment, there are &s;ome Branches of Study, which have a mo&s;t apparent Tendency to entertain as well as to improve; and, of this Kind, &s;ome Subjects of Hi&s;tory will claim the Preference; and, perhaps, there is no Part of Hi&s;tory better received than the Account of great Changes and Revolutions in States and Governments.</P>
<P>Of all Changes, tho&s;e in Religion which have been &s;udden and &s;ignal, are enquired into with the mo&s;t eager Curio&s;ity; and, where the Salvation of Souls has been chiefly aimed at, and the Credit, Honour and Intere&s;t of Churches promoted and e&s;tabli&s;hed, the more Pious and Judicious will find their Satisfaction much more than compen&s;ate the &s;eeming Trouble of their Search into the Reality and Circum&s;tances thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">The Alteration that has been made in the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion of this Nation for little more than the two la&s;t Centuries, has produced &s;uch Effects every where, that it is no Wonder if all Per&s;ons de&s;ire to &s;ee a clear Account of the &s;everal Steps by which it advanced; of the Councils that directed it, and the Motives, both religious and political, that inclined Men of all Conditions to concur in it.</P>
<P>To lay before the Public a particular and im|partial Account of the Con&s;titution and Doctrine of the &s;everal Denominations of Chri&s;tians, is the principal Intent of this Undertaking; and, upon the mo&s;t mature Enquiry I have been able to make, I find the Doctrines and Tenets of all De|nominations to have varied greatly from their original Con&s;titution, and di&s;tingui&s;hing Character.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation will appear to be true, even with re&s;pect to the <HI>Roman Catholic</HI> Church, which has been mo&s;t of all &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve the <HI>Catholic</HI> Faith, as they call it, pure and uncorrupt. The wi&s;er Part di&s;claim &s;ome of their mo&s;t ab&s;urd Doctrines, and di&s;card and de&s;pi&s;e many of their ridiculous Ceremonies: Some Reformation has been made in the&s;e Re&s;pects by Churches of that Per&s;ua&s;ion in different Nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> and it is more than probable that many of the mo&s;t &s;erious and judicious Papi&s;ts would be glad to &s;ee a greater Reformation even in the Funda|mentals of their Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Picart,</HI> under the Article of adoring the Cro&s;s, &s;ays, "This Ceremony gives great Scandal to <HI>Here|tics,</HI> who look upon this &s;olemn Adoration on Good Friday as manife&s;t Idolatry&mdash;would it not be better to decline &s;ome Ceremonies which <HI>Ca|tholics</HI> are reduced to Shifts, Di&s;gui&s;es, and Eva&s;ions
<PB N="vi" REF="5">to defend, and which are looked on as Folly to the Libertine, and a Scandal to the Prote&s;tant?"
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Picart</HI>'s Edition of the <HI>Religious Ceremonies,</HI> Vol. II. P. 25.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the Church of <HI>England</HI> it is well known great Alterations have taken place &s;ince the Re|formation: At that Time the generality of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Divines, e&s;pecially the Majority of the Committee for Compiling the Articles of this Church, were &s;trict or rigid Calvini&s;ts, who, in Spite of all the Oppo&s;ition they met with, mo|delled &s;everal of the Articles in Favour of Cal|vini&s;m, which now the greate&s;t Part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Divines would fain explain contrary to their literal Sen&s;e and Meaning; repre&s;ent them as, at be&s;t, ambiguous and capable of a Sen&s;e more con&s;i&s;tent with the general Tenour of the Scrip|tures, and the Rea&s;on and common Sen&s;e of Mankind.&mdash;In like Manner <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>'s Creed was then, by Authority, in&s;erted in the Book of Com|mon Prayer, and, with all the incomprehen&s;ible My&s;teries and exceptionable Clau&s;es, cordially received by &s;ome, and impo&s;ed on others, as the true <HI>Catholic</HI> Faith; whereas now, to &s;ay no more to explode it, the Church in general "would be glad to be well rid of it." If the Que&s;tion were a&s;ked, What are the genuine Sentiments of the Church of <HI>England?</HI> it would be a very vague, indeterminate and fal&s;e An&s;wer, to &s;ay they are contained in the XXXIX Articles; when it is well known that the Majority of our mo&s;t eminent Prelates and Divines of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, have embraced and profe&s;&s;ed, and in their public Preaching and Writings endeavour to inculcate, Principles more con&s;i&s;tent with the Nature of genuine Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Ob&s;ervation is equally true, with re&s;pect to many other Denominations, namely the
<PB N="vii" REF="6">Kirk or Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h Pre&s;|byterians, Bapti&s;ts, Quakers, &amp;c.</HI> as would be no difficult Matter to particularize in many In|&s;tances, were it not unnece&s;&s;ary, as will evidently appear in the Cour&s;e of this Work.</P>
<P>This may be one Rea&s;on why all the Hi&s;tories extant, of the &s;everal Sectaries of Chri&s;tians, differ &s;o widely from each other, and are &s;o very im|perfect and erroneous: I wi&s;h this was the only Rea&s;on, and that there did not appear &s;ome evi|dent Marks of a malevolent De&s;ign to mi&s;repre|&s;ent Sectaries, in order to expo&s;e them to Cen&s;ure and Contempt. This I hint with particular Re|gard to <HI>Ro&s;s</HI>'s View of all Religions, being, of all others, the mo&s;t &s;currilous and fal&s;e; and to that voluminous Edition of the Religious Ceremonies of all Nations, in which the Author appears greatly mi&s;taken in the Con&s;titution and Principles of &s;everal Societies of <HI>Engli&s;h Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters;</HI> and al&s;o to <HI>Bo&s;&s;uet</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the Variation of <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Churches in the <HI>Low Countries.</HI></P>
<P>But this Crime of Mi&s;repre&s;entation is not applicable only to a few Hi&s;tories of our own or foreign Nations, and tho&s;e for the mo&s;t part ob&s;olete: Certain modern Writers &s;eem to have taken a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure in blackening the Cha|racters of &s;ome Societies of Chri&s;tians, and ex|po&s;ing and cen&s;uring &s;uch Doctrines or Rites as they learned not in their Infancy to believe or practi&s;e; forgetting, though a&s;hamed to deny, the Right of private Judgment, and Liberty of Con|&s;cience; and too often ignorant of the genuine Principles of tho&s;e Societies they cen&s;ure, and of the Arguments upon which they are founded. Indeed I have been often &s;urprized to find Per&s;ons
<PB N="viii" REF="7">of Credit, and otherwi&s;e of good Under&s;tanding, &s;o extremely ignorant, not only with re&s;pect to the genuine Sentiments of other Denominations of Chri&s;tians; but in a very high Degree, of the di&s;tingui&s;hing Tenets or Principles of that Re|ligion they them&s;elves profe&s;s; and con&s;equently of the Arguments on which they re&s;t. This was one Motive to the Pro&s;ecution of the pre&s;ent Work; and another was to &s;uppre&s;s Bigotry, Prejudice, and Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, too apt to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of narrow Minds; and, in their Place, to inculcate and improve that mutual Love and Charity, even for Per&s;ons of differing Opinions, which is &s;o agreeable to the Dignity and Honour of Men and of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>I write for no Party; my Aim is to recom|mend a free and impartial Enquiry into the ge|nuine Principles of Chri&s;tianity, which is the ju&s;t Foundation of Truth and Virtue, Liberty and Charity.</P>
<P>That generally-received Maxim, <HI>Rome was not built in a Day,</HI> is as undoubtedly true with re|&s;pect to the Con&s;titution, Doctrine and Cere|monies of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, as of its external Form and &s;tately Edifices; for this Rea&s;on I have judged a brief Account of the principal Revolutions and Variations in the Government, Wor&s;hip, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of that Church for &s;eventeen Cen|turies, a proper Preliminary to the Hi&s;tory of its pre&s;ent State.</P>
<P>The Account I have given of the Principles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, I have fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed in the Words of Pope <HI>Pius</HI>'s Creed, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> and has been ever &s;ince
<PB N="ix" REF="8">e&s;teemed by the Votaries of that Church, of the greate&s;t Authority. I have likewi&s;e endeavoured to explain or a&s;certain their true Sen&s;e, from Authors of their own, well approved of by that Church, and who&s;e Books have been licen&s;ed by public Au|thority; di&s;claiming and carefully avoiding, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the fallacious Glo&s;&s;es, and artful Di&s;gui&s;es of de&s;igning Prie&s;ts on the one Hand, and the Mi&s;apprehen&s;ions of the Vulgar on the other. For this Purpo&s;e I have con&s;ulted the mo&s;t valuable Hi&s;tories of that Church, their Con&s;titution, Doc|trine and Ceremonies publi&s;hed at that remarkable Period, when the Controver&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between ma|ny of our eminent Prelates and of their Prie&s;ts and Cardinals from the Year 1682 to 1688, inclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o made &s;everal Extracts from Dr. <HI>Mid|dleton</HI>'s Letters from <HI>Rome,</HI> wherein he has &s;hewn, (conformable to &s;everal other Authors) that many of the Rites and Ceremonies of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church were of Heathen original, and de&s;titute of &s;uperior Authority for their Practice: In the&s;e Extracts, I have not thought it nece&s;&s;ary to Change his Lan|guage, to avoid the Reprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e Senti|ments and Ceremonies; nor have I allowed my&s;elf to exclaim or to detail out &s;uch Invectives as are too generally u&s;ed, but have no proper and natural Tendency to convince the <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> or confirm the <HI>Prote&s;tant.</HI>&mdash;If I have given any Scope to Cen|&s;ure, it is in the Article of Per&s;ecution, where it was impo&s;&s;ible, after reading &s;o many tragical Accounts of the horrid Cruelties of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> and other in|human Executions, to be impartial and hone&s;t without expre&s;&s;ing the utmo&s;t Abhorrence and De|te&s;tation of &s;uch Practices, and the Principles that led to them; a &s;uperficial Mention of which, will alarm every true <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> who has ever con&s;idered
<PB N="x" REF="9">the Value of civil and religious Liberty and knows how to prize them.&mdash;With Re&s;pect to other Senti|ments and Practices that are un&s;criptural and mere|ly of human Invention, I am &s;orry to &s;ee, in the Defences of Popery, how much they are founded upon the Authority of ancient Fathers, and that they are &s;o often &s;hewn to be con&s;onant with &s;ome former Practices of our e&s;tabli&s;hed Church; with certain of the Canons, Articles, and Liturgy; which may fully convince us, that mo&s;t of the Ex|ceptionable Parts of our Articles and Liturgy aro&s;e from the undue Veneration which the Compilers of them paid to the Fathers St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> St. <HI>Ambro&s;e, &amp;c.</HI> and likewi&s;e &s;ufficiently demon|&s;trate to the impartial Reader, that <HI>Antiquity is a wretched Guide to a Searcher after Truth; and that human Formularies of Faith are a chief Ob&s;tacle to real Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>As to the political Views, ba&s;e Artifices, and Ex|actions of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts, too much of it will appear in the Cour&s;e of this Hi&s;tory: An impartial Mention of them is in Fact to explode them: Par|ticularly in the Hi&s;tory of the State of Religion in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> from the fir&s;t planting of Chri&s;tiani|ty, at the latter End of the VIth and Beginning of the VIIth Century, to the Middle of the XIVth Century, when <HI>Wickliffe</HI> made &s;ome Efforts to|wards a Reformation. The Reader will find many remarkable Occurrences, in Re&s;pect to the In|croachments of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> on the Prero|gatives of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kings, and the common Rights of their Subjects, as well as by the gro&s;s Corruptions of the original Purity and Simplicity of Chri&s;tianity, as mu&s;t ever be deemed peculiar In|centives to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, to throw off that
<PB N="xi" REF="10">Yoke if po&s;&s;ible, and pur&s;ue a Reformation in earne&s;t&mdash;and at the &s;ame Time, he will ob&s;erve &s;uch Difficulties attending it, as mu&s;t give us an high Opinion of our principal Reformers, and lead us to value our Liberties both civil and religious.</P>
<P>In the Hi&s;tory of the Reformation abroad and at home, and of the State of Religion, more e&s;pe|cially in the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, and from that re|markable Period to the Revolution, I mu&s;t own I have much exceeded my intended Limits; but when I con&s;idered, the nece&s;&s;ary Connection be|tween the Reformation in the <HI>Low Countries, France,</HI> and in <HI>England,</HI> the many intere&s;ting Cir|cum&s;tances that occurred, in which our principal Reformers were exhibited to View (which indeed de&s;erve to be ever pre&s;erved, and handed down to late&s;t Po&s;terity) and which I doubt not will be pe|ru&s;ed by many, with Plea&s;ure and Improvement, I was not willing to omit them.</P>
<P>Having mentioned <HI>Wickliffe</HI> as the <HI>Morning Star</HI> of the Reformation, I have likewi&s;e given a general Hi&s;tory of the Period in which he lived, to the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth, the reputed Time when Prote&s;tanti&s;m took its Ri&s;e: In this Interval I have found many Circum&s;tances of an intere&s;ting Nature relative to the nece&s;&s;ity of a Reformation, the Difficulties attending it, and likewi&s;e of inci|dental Occurrences contributing thereto, which, at Length, made it ri&s;e &s;uperior to Oppo&s;ition. How far the Reformation was intended or effected by King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, is a Point in which even critical Hi&s;torians are much divided: I have therefore &s;ought the Materials of this difficult Part of my Hi&s;tory, from ancient MSS, as well as modern Tracts; and I have been &s;omewhat more diffu&s;e in
<PB N="xii" REF="11">this Part, as I have &s;elected from two MSS, his Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith wrote in 1536, and <HI>Memoirs of his Character,</HI> compiled much about the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>My next Province is to give a Hi&s;tory of the State of Religion in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Reigns, down to the pre&s;ent Time, in which I have been careful to introduce whatever has been &s;ignal and intere&s;ting, either in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, or of &s;uch remarkable Tran&s;actions and Revolutions, in the civil Hi&s;tory of this Nation, as are connected with it for more than two Hundred Years, and as the prevailing Opinions and Parties, gave Ri&s;e at different Times, to a Va|riety of Tran&s;actions in Council, in Parliament, and eccle&s;ia&s;tic Convocations, &s;ome of a remarkable in|tere&s;ting Nature, I thought them the proper Sub|jects of &s;uch an Hi&s;tory: But as many of them are peculiar to different Denominations, that Part of them I have in&s;erted in the re&s;pective Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Sects, and what properly relate to the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Polity and Government of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> comes under that Head.</P>
<P>In the Pro&s;ecution of this Part, I have attempted &s;ome Account of the Princes, and mo&s;t eminent Prelates and Divines, who&s;e Lives and Writings have done Honour to the Chri&s;tian Prote&s;tant Church, and al&s;o of &s;uch as have attempted to &s;ap the Foundation of Truth, Liberty and Virtue.</P>
<P>In treating of the Articles of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> I have fir&s;t given them in the e&s;tabli&s;hed Form, contained in the Book of Common Prayer; I have then endeavoured to give their true Sen&s;e, from &s;undry of the mo&s;t approved Expo&s;itions of tho&s;e Articles, by &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed Prelates of
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">our Church, and other Divines of Note, and gene|rally by Extracts in their own Words; &s;ave where I have thought it might be more properly abridged, and in that Ca&s;e I have given an Ab&s;tract, with due Regard to the Sen&s;e and Meaning of the Author, and of the Articles in their original Form, in a Sen&s;e in which the more judicious Divines would recommend them to be under&s;tood.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Welch|man,</HI> in his Expo&s;ition of the&s;e Articles, pays a par|ticular Regard to the Sen&s;e of the ancient Fathers, St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom,</HI> St. <HI>Ignatius, Irenaeus, &amp;c.</HI> and it appears that the Language and Sentiment contained in them, are in great Mea&s;ure borrowed from the Writings of tho&s;e Lights of the primitive Church, which, by the Way, &s;hews the great Ve|neration and E&s;teem our fir&s;t Compilers had for Anti|quity; and very often to the Neglect of more certain, e&s;&s;ential and important Rules and Principles of Judg|ing, concerning the Truths of the &s;acred Scriptures: But this is only a Hint; for I mu&s;t declare that I have made it a general Rule, throughout the whole of this Work, to relate Facts and de&s;cribe Things as I found them, without attempting to animadvert thereon.</P>
<P>In repre&s;enting the Con&s;titution and Doctrines of other Denominations of Chri&s;tians, I have made it my con&s;tant Rule to &s;hew that I under&s;tood the Subject, and was under no undue Bia&s;s. Impar|tiality I e&s;teemed e&s;&s;entially recommendatory of this Work, and the be&s;t Apology I could make for what|ever involuntary Errors and Imperfections might at|tend the Publication.</P>
<P>Throughout the Whole I have aimed at Conci&s;e|ne&s;s, as far as I judged would comport with the Plan I had in View, its Entertainment and U&s;efulne&s;s;
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">for I have characterized each Sect and explained their Doctrines, more e&s;pecially their peculiar Tenets, where I could, in their own Words.&mdash; This Method will afford not a barely &s;uperficial and partial Account of what may be the particular Sen|timents of here and there a private Per&s;on and ob|&s;cure Society; but of the genuine Principles of that Body or Community, which is nece&s;&s;ary to forming a ju&s;t Idea of them; and whenever it has been ne|ce&s;&s;ary, I have had proper Information from Cor|re&s;pondence, or given a per&s;onal Attendance at their A&s;&s;emblies and taken Minutes, for greater certainty and Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Among&s;t a Variety of Readers I cannot expect the Approbation of all. Some there are &s;o extream|ly indifferent, with re&s;pect to the principal Diffe|rence of Sentiment among Chri&s;tians, as plainly implies they have never made Religion their Study, or that their own Profe&s;&s;ion is not the Effect of their Enquiry; but that they are governed in their Choice, by the Dictates of their Tutors, or the Sanction of Authority; and to &s;uch, Popery would, probably, have been as agreeable as Prote&s;tanti&s;m, or Mahomedani&s;m as Chri&s;tianity, if it had been their Lot to have been born in the Countries where the&s;e are e&s;tabli&s;hed. I &s;hall leave them to enjoy their &s;upine Indifference; but not without &s;incerely congratulating my Countrymen, on our di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Privilege, that we live in a Nation and at a Time, when Religion has in great Mea&s;ure gained the A&s;cendant over Super&s;tition; Truth in general prevailed again&s;t Darkne&s;s and Error, and Liberty, civil and religious, triumphed over Tyranny and Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience &s;ake: And for the&s;e I

<P>By &s;ome it has been &s;ugge&s;ted that this Work will be too dull and &s;erious, and &s;avour too much of the controverted Points of Religion; to &s;uch I beg leave to ob&s;erve, I have not often attempted to animad|vert or expatiate on particular Opinions or Practices, that was not my Province; but to give a genuine Relation of &s;uch Facts as appertain to the Hi&s;|tory, and the&s;e are, I pre&s;ume, as well calcula|ted to improve the Gentleman, and give Life and Spirit to Conver&s;ation, at proper Intervals, as any other Subjects more commonly introduced; and where &s;uch a Variety of Facts, Circum&s;tances and Characters are introduced, I cannot apprehend it will be unentertaining or u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>By attempting &s;uch a Compendium of the reli|gious Principles of particular Denominations, I ima|gined I might particularly adapt this Work to the peru&s;al of many young Per&s;ons, and other well di&s;po&s;ed Chri&s;tians, who may not have Lei&s;ure or Inclination to read many di&s;tinct Treati&s;es, and it may an&s;wer a particular good Purpo&s;e, in regard to their Information and Improvement.</P>

<P><PB N="xvi" REF="15">Nor do I apprehend the Reader will look upon this as a prolix Hi&s;tory, when he con&s;iders not only the Extent of the Plan, but that many of the Hi&s;tories nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;ulted are very volumi|nous; as <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>'s, <HI>Dupin</HI>'s, <HI>Bingham</HI>'s, and <HI>Collier</HI>'s eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tories; <HI>Richer</HI>'s of Councils, Father <HI>Paul</HI>'s of that of <HI>Trent, Picart</HI>'s religious Ceremonies, and the Collections of Tracts for and again&s;t Popery, <HI>Brandt</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the Reformation in the <HI>Low Countries, Burnet</HI>'s and many others, of the Refor|mation in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Laval</HI>'s of that in <HI>France; Calderwood</HI>'s, <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI>'s, and diver&s;e others of the Kirk of <HI>Scotland; Sewel</HI>'s of <HI>Quakeri&s;m; Neal</HI>'s of the <HI>Puritans,</HI> and <HI>Cro&s;by</HI>'s of the <HI>Engli&s;h Bapti&s;ts:</HI> Be|&s;ides a great Variety of Tracts on Points of Controver&s;y, Dictionaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that mu&s;t be refered to, and con&s;ulted, on &s;uch a Number of Subjects; <HI>Rapin, Hume, Smollet,</HI> and other civil Hi&s;torians of our own Nation, nece&s;&s;ary for a&s;certaining and illu&s;trating all &s;uch Matters, as have an immediate Connection with the principal De&s;ign of this Work.

But notwith&s;tanding the A&s;&s;i&s;|tance I have received, from &s;o many eminent Hi&s;to|rians, I have followed no Author any farther than I apprehended him to coincide with Truth.</P>
<P>After having been at all this Expence and Trou|ble to procure Materials and proper Helps for the Execution of my Plan, it is very probable and al|mo&s;t unavoidable, that many Things may have e&s;caped my notice, which might have contributed to illu&s;trate, confirm, or embelli&s;h the &s;everal Parts of it. I can only flatter my&s;elf that the Reader will find a &s;ufficient Number of Quotations to a&s;certain
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">the genuine Principles of the &s;everal Societies re|&s;pectively, their Rites, Ceremonies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which I have given the following Hi&s;tory. And I hope the judicious Reader will look on it as no Dimuni|tion of the Value of this Work, that many of the Ideas, as well as the Language, in which they are expre&s;&s;ed, are borrowed from the Writings of the mo&s;t eminent Divines of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, and other Denominations, e&s;pecially as, in many In&s;tances, it was nece&s;&s;ary for authenticating the Account I gave of the different Sectaries; and, ve|ry often, I found my Sentiments &s;o happily expre&s;|&s;ed in them, that I pre&s;umed from my own Appro|bation it would be mo&s;t agreeable to my Readers.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not urge as any Motive to this Work, that I apprehended Popery was gaining Ground in this Nation; but as that Religion is founded in Church Policy, and propagated with Artifice and Indu&s;try by their Prie&s;ts, and is &s;uited to captivate weak Minds, it cannot be un&s;ea&s;onable to point out &s;ome of their Eva&s;ions, and to give a genuine Account of their Con&s;titution, Doctrines, Ceremo|nies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and this I judge will be &s;ufficient, if im|partially repre&s;ented, and attended to, to guard Pro|te&s;tants again&s;t the Corruption, Super&s;tition, and Cruelty of the <HI>Roman Catholic</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>Nor am I inclined to think a Spirit of Per&s;ecu|tion prevails among Prote&s;tants, or of uncharitably cen&s;uring Per&s;ons for different Sentiments and Pro|fe&s;&s;ion: I wi&s;h, indeed, this was more evident; for I find &s;ome Authors &s;ugge&s;t, that this Principle is far from being extingui&s;hed, and that many rather want Opportunity than Inclination to per&s;ecute, and in&s;tance the high Claims of the Church, which di&s;|covered them&s;elves in the <HI>Bangorian</HI> Controver&s;y;

This is &s;ometimes called ethics or moral virtue, and includes in it the&s;e duties which, on the principles of rea&s;on, a man owes to God, to &s;ociety, and to him&s;elf; the duties we owe to the Deity re&s;ulting from our rela|tion to him, as our Creator, benefactor, lawgiver, and judge, and as the original fountain of all goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom, beauty and happine&s;s are veneration, grati|tude,
<PB N="xxvii" REF="26">love, re&s;ignation, dependence, obedience, wor|&s;hip and prai&s;e, which, according to the mea&s;ure of our finite capacities, ought to maintain &s;ome proportion to the grandeur of the object whom we love, and the greatne&s;s of our obligation. The duties we owe to &s;ociety of peculiar obligation, are filial or conjugal; but in general we owe to others, love, ju&s;tice, &s;incerity, fidelity, charity, the love of our country, and univer|&s;al benevolence. The duties re&s;pecting our&s;elves are prudence, fortitude, the government of the appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, humility and re&s;ignation; the&s;e con&s;titute the temper of happine&s;s, and are the elements of our perfection and felicity

Thus to love and reverence the Deity, to do ju&s;tice between man and man, between our neighbours and our&s;elves, and to be charitable and benevolent to all proper objects, are all of them branches of natural religion; which every man's rea&s;on may di&s;cover to him, and which the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of things requires from him, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubjects him to

<P>One important u&s;e which Dr. Chandler
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chandler's Immutable Difference Sy&s;tem, p. 286.</NOTE>, and many other judicious authors, draws from the&s;e premi&s;&s;es is, that this difference of things, ari&s;ing out of their very natures, leads us to form ju&s;t conceptions of the per|fections and attributes of God. For in&s;tance, when we &s;ay, that God doth nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;t, doth not this &s;uppo&s;e a natural and fixed difference between nece&s;&s;ary and precarious exi&s;tence? In like manner, when we &s;ay, that God is eternal, immen&s;e, intelligent, all-powerful, and the like; we mean, that God is not a temporary, limited, incon&s;cious, impotent Being; and of con&s;equence do &s;uppo&s;e, that the di&s;tinctions are not arbitrary, but as nece&s;&s;ary and eternal as the Being of God him&s;elf. In like manner, with re&s;pect to God's
<PB N="xxxii" REF="31">moral perfections, when we &s;ay, that God is wi&s;e, and ju&s;t, and good, and eternally and unalterably &s;o; we mean, at lea&s;t, that God is not a fooli&s;h, unrighteous, evil, and cruel Being; and therefore mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the difference between wi&s;dom and folly, ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice, evil and good, cruelty and mercy, is ab&s;o|lutely eternal and unalterable as God him&s;elf, of whom we affirm the one and deny the other; and therefore is not owing to his willing that it &s;hould be &s;o, nor alter|able at his plea&s;ure, nor dependent on him for its con|tinuance; for if the di&s;tinction between the&s;e moral entities or objects was merely arbitrary, and originally the re&s;ult only of the will of God, it can never be af|firmed of him that he is eternally and immutably the one and not the other. For upon this &s;uppo&s;ition he was not true, or ju&s;t, or good, till he willed to be &s;o, and might have been weak, unju&s;t, and evil, by a like de|termination of his will; if there be no e&s;&s;ential immu|table difference in the things them&s;elves. Nor can there be any po&s;&s;ible certainty of God's continuing for the future to be wi&s;e, and ju&s;t, and good, and not the contrary; for if there be no other difference between the one and the other, but what the will of God hath con&s;tituted; that will cea&s;ing, or altering the&s;e di&s;|tinctions, in con&s;equence mu&s;t cea&s;e or alter, and God may be evil in&s;tead of good, or rather good and evil at the &s;ame time; which is an evident ab&s;urdity and con|tradiction.</P>
<P>On the&s;e accounts, &s;ays our author, I apprehend it plainly appears, that the very notion of God implies the nece&s;&s;ary, e&s;&s;ential, immutable, and independent difference between moral good and evil; and, indeed, without this &s;uppo&s;ition, we could have no &s;ure and fixed rule of action to our&s;elves as rea&s;onable creatures; for if piety, ju&s;tice, charity, and the like virtues, are the creatures of mere power, and the precarious ef|fects of ab&s;olute will and plea&s;ure, power and will may immediately alter them, cancel men's obligations to
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="32" MS="y">regard them; and &s;ub&s;titute in the room of them im|piety, inju&s;tice and cruelty, as the great obligations and duties of human nature

<P>Again, moral good and evil are a kind of relative terms, that is, they do &s;uppo&s;e, either in idea or actual exi&s;tence, certain rea&s;onable beings, and certain rela|tions in which they &s;tand to each other. Before ever the creation was formed, God was in and of him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite perfection, of all that power and wi&s;dom, which could not but exert them&s;elves in all acts of ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s to his creatures. After their being brought in actual exi&s;tence, the original fitne&s;s of which conduct towards them was clearly di&s;cerned by God; whil&s;t they were yet only pre&s;ent in idea to his mind, and aro&s;e from tho&s;e apprehended relations which were actually in time to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between God and them. And as God had nothing to determine him in the formation of the world, but the direction of his own infinite under&s;tanding and wi&s;dom, he was un|doubtedly at liberty to form what &s;y&s;tems of beings he thought proper.</P>
<P>When, indeed, God had actually given being to rea&s;onable creatures of &s;uch particular capacities and circum&s;tances, their relations to each other; then, the fitne&s;s and obligations of tho&s;e duties re&s;ulting from them, became certain and nece&s;&s;ary, and were no longer dependent on the will of God, whether they &s;hould carry in them any rea&s;onable obligation or not; and when they became the matter of an immediate divine command, they were not therefore rea&s;onable only be|cau&s;e commanded, but commanded becau&s;e naturally and antecedently rea&s;onable. And the rea&s;on of this is evident, becau&s;e the fitne&s;s and unfitne&s;s of moral good and evil, are as nece&s;&s;ary and certain, as the natural and original difference between them. This, therefore, mu&s;t be
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="33">the &s;upreme, immutable and univer&s;al rule of action to all rea&s;onable beings what&s;oever. It is the one certain and unerring rule of the Divine conduct, and con&s;e|quently the mo&s;t certain, the mo&s;t amiable, and worthy rule of action to every rea&s;onable creature

<P>And the evident tendency of virtue, &s;ays another ingenious author, is not only the private happine&s;s of &s;ingle per&s;ons, but the good of the whole human kind; an univer&s;al benevolence links us together, and inte|re&s;ts every one of us in the affairs of another, &s;o far as to de&s;ire and endeavour their &s;afety and happine&s;s, not incon&s;i&s;tently with our own.

<P>When we con&s;ider the con&s;titution of human nature, with all its powers, affections, and principles of action, as the work of God; then that &s;en&s;e of right and wrong of moral good and evil, which is the great di&s;|tinction of mankind from all the inferior orders, ap|peareth to demand particular notice; as being not on|ly in it&s;elf con&s;idered, the highe&s;t and mo&s;t important faculty of the mind, but as what is given us for di|recting our conduct, and as what principally pointeth out to man his chief end, and that which is his &s;u|preme good.

<P>But it is an inquiry of the utmo&s;t moment to virtue and to human happine&s;s, how the Creator is di&s;po&s;ed and affected towards his creatures, as they ob&s;erve it, or deviate from it in their actions. It may be imagin|ed, and this appeareth plainly to have been the &s;en&s;e of &s;ome per&s;ons, that though the univer&s;e, and all the creatures in it, are the work of an original intelligent cau&s;e, perfectly wi&s;e, powerful, and beneficent; and the whole creation is governed by the &s;ole &s;uperintend|ing providence of this being, and particularly, that all the in&s;tincts and affections planted in the heart of man, are his workman&s;hip; yet he doth not attend at all to the temper or behaviour of men, as being according to the moral quality of them, the objects of his approbation or di&s;plea&s;ure: that, though he hath given to his creatures, the &s;en&s;e of good and evil, of right and wrong, as a means of &s;erving tho&s;e purpo&s;es by them which he had in view; yet he him&s;elf hath not that regard to right and wrong, which we find in our own minds, nor any thing analogous; and therefore he is not di&s;plea&s;ed with the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of this law of our nature, nor hath any plea&s;ure or complacency in our obedience, and that we are never to expect any in|terpo&s;ition of his, to give us tokens of his favour, for having pur&s;ued that which is right, or of his di&s;plea|&s;ure, for having done what is wrong: that men are by the laws of nature thoroughly furni&s;hed for &s;erving the purpo&s;es of this life; but that this is all that is
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="35">to be expected, and that by e&s;tabli&s;hing and main|taining this con&s;titution of things, the Creator hath made provi&s;ion for pre&s;erving the world in that &s;tate which will an&s;wer his original de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Very widely different from this way of thinking is the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e who con&s;ider the &s;upreme Being as a lawgiver, and a moral governor, in the proper &s;en&s;e of the word; believing, that as he hath, in the &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, written a law upon the heart of every man, and hath planted in every man a con&s;cience to approve or di&s;approve of his actions, as they are good or evil; &s;o he is him&s;elf attentive to the conduct of every individual, is plea&s;ed with the conformity of his temper and actions to the law that he hath given him, and di&s;plea&s;ed with the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of it, and will interpo&s;e to te&s;tify his plea&s;ure or di&s;plea&s;ure by &s;uch rewards and puni&s;hments as perfect wi&s;dom &s;hall &s;ee fit and nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the end of a moral ad|mini&s;tration; that though God doth not interpo&s;e in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things by any acts of his, &s;o as fully to an&s;wer what rea&s;on ultimately expecteth from a perfect moral ruler, in rewarding the good, and puni&s;hing the bad; yet another &s;tate of things is to be expected, in which the great de&s;ign of his moral admini&s;tration &s;hall be perfected, and he, as judge of the world, will do right to every &s;ubject of his moral kingdom.</P>
<P>I cannot better clo&s;e the preceding remarks on na|tural religion, and thereby introduce the advantages of a revelation, than with the te&s;timony of Dr. Mid|dleton, in relation to the religious and moral &s;enti|ments of Cicero, the greate&s;t Heathen philo&s;opher, who&s;e ideas were probably the mo&s;t refined of any man una&s;&s;i&s;ted by revelation.</P>
<P>The Doctor, having ob&s;erved that the &s;cheme of morality profe&s;&s;ed by Cicero was certainly the mo&s;t complete that the Gentile world had ever been ac|quainted
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="36">with, the utmo&s;t effort that human nature could make towards attaining its proper end, and taken notice of &s;ome con&s;iderable deficiencies in it, he adds, "From this general view of Cicero's religion, one cannot help ob&s;erving, that the mo&s;t exalted &s;tate of human rea&s;on is &s;o far from &s;uper&s;eding the u&s;e, that it demon&s;trates the benefit of a more explicit reve|lation; for though the natural law, in the perfection it was carried by Cicero, might &s;erve as a &s;ufficient guide to the few, &s;uch as him&s;elf, of enlarged minds, and happy di&s;po&s;itions; yet it had been &s;o long depraved and adulterated by the prevailing errors and vices of mankind, that it was not di&s;coverable even to tho&s;e few, without great pains and &s;tudy, and could not produce in them at la&s;t any thing more than a hope, never a full per&s;ua&s;ion; whil&s;t the greate&s;t part of mankind, even of the virtuous and inqui&s;itive, lived <HI>without the knowledge of a God, or the expectation of a futurity,</HI> and the multitude in every country was left to the gro&s;s idolatry of the popular wor&s;hip."</P>
<P>This gives us abundant rea&s;on to reflect on the ad|vantages we enjoy by the divine light of a revelation, without the pains of &s;earching, or danger of mi&s;taking, whereby we have not only the hope but the a&s;&s;urance of happine&s;s, and are not only the believers, but the heirs of immortality.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t however be acknowledged, that chri&s;tianity pre&s;uppo&s;es the truth of natural religion. What&s;oever &s;ubverts natural religion, does con&s;equently much more &s;ubvert chri&s;tianity, and what&s;oever tends to confirm natural religion is proportionably of &s;ervice to the true intere&s;t of the Chri&s;tian

That the Chri&s;tian religion, con&s;idered in its primitive &s;implicity, and as taught in the &s;criptures, has all the marks and proofs of its being actually and truly a divine revelation. 2. That the practical duties it enjoins, are all &s;uch as are mo&s;t agreeable to our natural notions of God, and mo&s;t perfective of the nature, and conducive to the happi|ne&s;s and well-being of men. 3. That the motives by which the Chri&s;tian religion inforces the practice of the duties it enjoins, are &s;uch as are mo&s;t &s;uitable to the wi&s;dom of God, and mo&s;t an&s;werable to the natural expectations of man. 4. That the peculiar manner with which the Chri&s;tian religion enjoins the duties, and urges the motives before-mentioned, are exactly con&s;onant to the dictates of &s;ound rea&s;on, or the unprejudiced light of nature, and mo&s;t perfective of it. 5. That all the doctrines, which the true, &s;imple and uncorrupted Chri&s;tian religion teaches, are, tho' indeed many of them not di&s;coverable by the light of nature, yet, when di&s;covered by revelation, mo&s;t agree|able to found unprejudiced rea&s;on.</P>

Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to a writer of the Romi&s;h church, he thus pleads the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, "Know then, Sir, that when I &s;ay the religion of Pro|te&s;tants is in truth to be preferred before yours; as on the one &s;ide, I do not under&s;tand by your religion the doc|trine of Bellarmine or Baronius, or any other private man among&s;t you; nor the doctrine of the Sorbonne or of the Je&s;uits, or of the Dominicans, or of any other particular company or &s;ociety among&s;t you; but that wherein you all agree or profe&s;s to agree, the doctrine of the council of Trent; &s;o accordingly on the other &s;ide, by the religion of Prote&s;tants, I do not under&s;tand the doctrine of Luther or Calvin, or Me|lancton, nor the confe&s;&s;ion of Aug&s;burg or Geneva, nor the catechi&s;m of Heidelberg, nor the articles of the church of England; no, nor the harmony of Prote&s;tant creeds and confe&s;&s;ions; but that wherein they all agree, and which they all &s;ub&s;cribe with one accord, as the undoubted perfect rule of their faith and actions, that is, the Bible. The Bible, I &s;ay the Bible only, is the religion of Prote&s;tants, what&s;oever el&s;e they believe be&s;ides it: and the plain, irrefragable, and indubitable con&s;equences of it, well may they hold as matters of opinion, but as matter of faith and religion, neither can they with coherence to their own grounds believe it
<PB N="lvi" REF="55">them&s;elves, nor require the belief of it of others, without mo&s;t high and &s;chi&s;matical pre&s;umption. I, for my part, after a long, and (as I verily believe and hope) impartial &s;earch of the true way to eternal hap|pine&s;s, do profe&s;s plainly that I cannot find any re&s;t for the &s;ole of my foot, but upon this rock only. I &s;ee plainly, and with mine own eyes, that there are Popes again&s;t Popes, councils again&s;t councils, &s;ome fathers again&s;t others, the &s;ame fathers again&s;t them&s;elves, a con&s;ent of fathers of one age again&s;t a con&s;ent of fathers of another age, the church of one age again&s;t the church of another age. Traditive interpretations of &s;cripture are pretended; but there are few or none to be found. No tradition but only of &s;cripture can derive it&s;elf from the fountain, but may be plainly proved to be brought in, in &s;uch an age after Chri&s;t, or that &s;uch an age it was not: in a word, there is no &s;ufficient certainty but of &s;cripture only for any con|&s;idering man to build upon. This, therefore, and this only, I have rea&s;on to believe, this I will profe&s;s, ac|cording to this I will live, and for this, if there be oc|ca&s;ion, I will not only willingly, but even gladly, lo&s;e my life; though I &s;hould be &s;orry that Chri&s;tians &s;hould take it from me. Propo&s;e me any thing out of this book, and require whether I believe or no, and &s;eem it never &s;o incomprehen&s;ible to human rea&s;on, I will &s;ub&s;cribe it with hand and heart, as knowing no demon&s;tration can be &s;tronger than this, God hath &s;aid &s;o, therefore is it true. In other things, I will take no man's liberty of judging from him, neither &s;hall any man take mine from me.

<P>All this will be readily acknowledged by Prote&s;tant Chri&s;tians of every denomination, while others perhaps do not ea&s;ily perceive the rea&s;ons upon which this principle of their faith is founded, and they rai&s;e a va|riety of objections to the authenticity, per&s;picuity, rea|&s;onablene&s;s, and excellency of the Chri&s;tian revelation; the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which will be taken notice of in a following &s;ection.

<P>Truth is a term u&s;ed in a variety of &s;en&s;es,

<P>The different &s;en&s;es in which I have con&s;idered truth, or to which this term is applied, convey to our minds an idea of its nature and importance, and that there is a real e&s;&s;ential and ab&s;olute utility and advan|tage in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Indeed the pur&s;uit and acqui&s;ition of truth is of infinite concernment to mankind;

It is by this means we di&s;cover our duty to God and our fellow-creatures; by this we arrive at the knowledge of natural religion, and learn to confirm our faith in divine revelation, as well as to under&s;tand what is revealed. Our wi&s;dom, pru|dence, and piety, our pre&s;ent conduct, and our future hopes, are all influenced by the u&s;e of our rational powers in the &s;earch after truth
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Watts's Logic, p. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The love and de&s;ire of truth is a principle implant|ed in the nature of man; it has generally an ea&s;y ac|ce&s;s to unbia&s;&s;ed minds, and will a&s;&s;ume its empire and triumph over error, even in &s;pite of popularity, intere&s;t, and undue influence from others; and reli|gious truths have been often known to arm the mind with integrity, &s;uperior to the &s;evere&s;t per&s;ecution. Hence Polybius, the Roman hi&s;torian, ob&s;erves, that
<PB N="lix" REF="58">truth may be oppo&s;ed, but it cannot be &s;ubdued
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polybius in Excerptis, lib. xii.</NOTE>: and Cicero, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, that truth always carries &s;uch a force with her, that &s;he cannot be overcome, neither by the flattery of art, nor ingenuity of men; and though &s;he had no advocate or patron in her cau&s;e, yet &s;he would be able to defend her&s;elf
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cicero Orat. in Vatinium.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But this is not univer&s;ally acknowledged. There are men of a &s;ceptical turn of mind, who a&s;&s;ert there is no po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;tingui&s;hing truth from fal&s;ehood: and therefore they have abandoned all pretences to knowledge, and maintain &s;trenuou&s;ly that nothing is to be known.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t men of this humour made them&s;elves fa|mous in Greece by the name of &s;ceptics, that is, &s;eekers. They taught, that all things are uncertain, though they allowed that &s;ome were more probable than others. After the&s;e aro&s;e the &s;ect of the Pyrrhonics, from Pyrrho, their ma&s;ter, who would not allow one propo|&s;ition to be more probable than another. But of this &s;ect an ingenious author ob&s;erves, that their own doc|trine gives their profe&s;&s;ion the lie; becau&s;e they deter|mined concerning every propo&s;ition, that it was uncer|tain, and believed that as a certain truth, while they profe&s;&s;ed there was nothing certain
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Watts's Logic, p. 172.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t important que&s;tion then on this &s;ubject is this, what is the criterion or di&s;tingui&s;hed mark of truth? How &s;hall we know when a propo&s;ition is true or fal&s;e? There are &s;o many di&s;gui&s;es of truth in the world, &s;o many fal&s;e appearances of truth, that not only one man differs in his &s;entiments from another, but one &s;ectary ab&s;olutely deny what another e&s;teem undoubted and fundamental. Let us therefore en|quire what is the general criterion of truth; and, in order to this, it is proper to con&s;ider what is the rea|&s;on why we a&s;&s;ent to the truth of one propo&s;ition, and
<PB N="lx" REF="59">deny another; and this will be found to ari&s;e from a clear and di&s;tinct perception, or full evidence of the agreement or di&s;agreement of our ideas to one another, or to things; for &s;ince our minds are of &s;uch a make, that when the evidence is exceeding plain and &s;trong, we cannot with-hold our a&s;&s;ent, we &s;hould then be nece&s;|&s;arily expo&s;ed to believe fal&s;hood, if compleat evi|dence &s;hould be found in any propo&s;itions that are not true. But &s;urely the God of perfect wi&s;dom, truth and goodne&s;s, would never oblige his creatures to be thus deceived; and therefore he would never have con&s;tituted us of &s;uch a frame as would have rendered it naturally impo&s;&s;ible to guard again&s;t error

<P>There are two de&s;ires interwoven in the frame of our beings, the de&s;ire of truth, and the de&s;ire of happine&s;s; in both which there is a kind of infinity, which ari&s;es after this manner. By the contemplation of my own &s;oul, I gain the ideas of &s;everal perfections with which I perceive it to be adorned; following therefore the impul&s;e of my own mind, I enlarge the pro&s;pect, and widen my ideas more and more, till lo&s;t in the conception of a being, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the&s;e perfections, and very probably many more, with the additional characteri&s;tics of infinite and eternal: Now it is the nature of the under&s;tanding, and of the will, to pur&s;ue the &s;upreme truth, and the &s;upreme good; and con&s;equently while I have a being in view, in who&s;e idea is lodged infinite truth and infinite good, which alone is able to an&s;wer that idea of &s;omething like infinity that is in our de&s;ires, I &s;hall never re&s;t &s;atisfied in any allotment among the creatures, though in the fine&s;t apartment in the univer&s;e, and accommo|dated with every good, &s;hort of a corre&s;pondence and intercour&s;e with the Deity

There are many things in this dark and imperfect &s;tate, wherein we mu&s;t be content with probability, where our be&s;t light and rea&s;oning will reach no further; we mu&s;t balance arguments as ju&s;tly as we can; and when we cannot find weight enough on either &s;ide to determine the &s;cale with &s;overeign force and a&s;&s;u|rance, we mu&s;t content our&s;elves perhaps with a &s;mall preponderation.

The evidence of &s;en&s;e, is when we form a propo|&s;ition according to the evidence of any of our &s;en&s;es; it is upon this evidence that we know and believe the various occurrences in human life; and almo&s;t all the hi&s;tories of mankind, that are written by eye and ear-witne&s;&s;es, are built upon this principle.</P>
<P>It is a principle of the Epicureans, that the &s;en&s;es are not capable of being deceived; for be&s;ides that the &s;tructure of the organs, and the circum&s;tances of ob|jects con&s;idered, they ought not to repre&s;ent things otherwi&s;e than they do. The &s;en&s;es are purely pa&s;|&s;ive; they receive impre&s;&s;ions from &s;urrounding bo|dies, but pronounce nothing concerning them; that is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the mind, which delivers its opinion upon the divers appearances of &s;en&s;e, and too often not more ha&s;tily than wrong. When therefore we talk of the errors of the &s;en&s;es, the meaning is, that things are many times in them&s;elves quite different from what they appear to the &s;en&s;es; and that they who take their mea&s;ures of judging from the &s;en&s;es, will unavoidably be led into a thou&s;and mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons why people tru&s;t &s;o much to &s;en&s;e, I believe, are principally the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1">I. If &s;en&s;e may err, why not rea&s;on? If one power and faculty may be deceived, why not all others? At which rate we &s;hall have no criterion of truth, nor be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of certainty; but univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m mu&s;t bear down all before it. I an&s;wer, that becau&s;e &s;en&s;e may be impo&s;ed upon, it follows not that rea&s;on may; in ca&s;e &s;en&s;e mi&s;leads us, rea&s;on may &s;et us right again. So that here God hath provided a higher faculty to correct the errors oc|ca&s;ioned
<PB N="lxiii" REF="62">by the faculties below it; and perhaps the fallaciou&s;ne&s;s of our &s;en&s;es was de&s;igned for this very end, that we might make the more frequent u&s;e of our rea&s;on. But &s;hould rea&s;on be deceived, there is no faculty above this to inform it better; and are not the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God our &s;ecurity, that he would not frame us with &s;uch a con&s;titu|tion of mind, as &s;hould naturally lead us into er|ror? Be&s;ides this, we are to con&s;ider, that the mi&s;|takes of &s;en&s;e (when it does mi&s;take) are not dan|gerous; it has little to do with religion, upon which depends our mo&s;t important intere&s;t. But rea&s;on rightly under&s;tood, and rightly managed, is to be the mea&s;ure of our conduct; and con&s;equently if free from prejudices, we may be a&s;&s;ured that &s;hall never err in matters of moment and con&s;equence.</P>
<P N="2">II. If &s;en&s;e may be deceived in one or more in|&s;tances, why not in all? and if in all, we can be certain of nothing. I an&s;wer, this way of arguing is entirely inconclu&s;ive, becau&s;e the wi&s;e Governor has furni&s;hed us with rea&s;on to find out our mi&s;|take; and this, by comparing things together, it ea|&s;ily does. Upon the whole, we may conclude with this ob&s;ervation, that our &s;en&s;es were not given us to inform us &s;o much what things are in them&s;elves, as of the relation they bear to each other, and to our bodies
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grove, v. p. 409.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">III. As we learn what belongs to the body by the evidence of &s;en&s;e; &s;o we learn what belongs to the &s;oul by an inward con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, which may be called a &s;ort of internal feeling, or &s;piritual &s;en&s;ation of what pa&s;&s;es in the mind: Thus it appears that we obtain the knowledge of a multitude of propo&s;itions, as well as &s;ingle ideas, by the&s;e two principles, which Mr. Locke calls &s;en&s;ation and reflection. One of them is a &s;ort of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of what affects the body, and the other
<PB N="lxiv" REF="63">is a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of what pa&s;&s;es in the mind

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chambers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Intelligence relates chiefly to tho&s;e ab&s;tract propo&s;itions, which carry their own evidence with them, and admit no doubt about them. Our percep|tion of this &s;elf-evidence in any propo&s;ition, is called intelligence; it is our knowledge of tho&s;e fir&s;t principles of truth, which are as it were wrought into the very nature and make of our mind. Accord|ingly an intelligent being, mu&s;t have &s;ome immediate object of his under&s;tanding, or at lea&s;t a capacity of having &s;uch: an intelligent being, among the im|mediate objects of his mind, mu&s;t have &s;ome that are ab&s;tract and general; tho&s;e ideas or objects that are immediate, will be adequately and truly known to that mind, who&s;e ideas they are: the&s;e propo&s;itions are called axioms or maxims, or fir&s;t principles; the&s;e are the very foundation of all improved knowledge and rea&s;onings; and &s;uch an immediate view of things in their own nature, is &s;ometimes called <HI>intuition.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. Rea&s;oning is the next &s;ort of evidence, and that is, when one truth is inferred or drawn from others, by natural and ju&s;t methods of argument; as, when I &s;urvey the heavens and earth, this gives evidence to my rea&s;on, that there is a God who made them
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Watts's.</NOTE>. Thus, by the help of truths already known, more may be di&s;covered; for tho&s;e inferences which ari&s;e pre&s;ently from the application of general truths, to the particular things and ca&s;es contained under them, mu&s;t be ju&s;t, and will hold good, not only in re&s;pect of axioms and fir&s;t truths, but al&s;o and equally of theorems and other general truths. When they are
<PB N="lxv" REF="64">more known, the&s;e may be capable of the like appli|cations, and the truth of &s;uch con&s;equences as are made by virtue of them, will always be as evident as that of the theorems them&s;elves
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wolla&s;ton's Religion of Nature, p. 43. 4to Edit.</NOTE>: in other words, every ju&s;t con&s;equence is founded on &s;ome known truth; by virtue of which, one thing follows from another, and if the premi&s;&s;es are true, and the infe|rences are ju&s;t, they will be &s;o too. That power which any intelligent being has of &s;urveying his own ideas, and comparing them; of forming to him&s;elf out of tho&s;e that are immediate and ab&s;tract, &s;uch general and fundamental truths as he can be &s;ure of, and of making &s;uch inferences and conclu&s;ions as are agree|able to them, or to any other truth after it comes to be known, in order to find out more truth, prove or di&s;prove &s;ome a&s;&s;ertion, re&s;olve &s;ome que&s;tion, deter|mine what is fit to be done upon occa&s;ion, &amp;c. the ca&s;e or thing under con&s;ideration, being fir&s;t fairly &s;tated and prepared, is what I mean by the faculty of rea&s;on, or what intitles him to the epithet <HI>rational;</HI> or, in &s;hort, rea&s;on is the faculty for making &s;uch in|ferences and conclu&s;ions, as are mentioned under the preceding propo&s;ition
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 45. Some u&s;eful ob&s;ervations in the &s;eq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"The propo&s;itions, which I believe upon this kind of evidence, are called conclu&s;ions or rational truths, and the knowledge we gain this way is properly &s;cience."</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e remarked by the aforecited judicious author, in treating of the nature and foundations of probability, that the force of it re&s;ults from <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>ob&s;ervation</HI> together
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is objected to by other authors, as tho&s;e ob&s;ervations ari&s;e from the forementioned &s;prings of knowledge.</NOTE>. As the one is not &s;ufficient without the other, rea&s;on without <HI>ob&s;ervation</HI> wants matter to work upon, and ob&s;ervations are neither to be made ju&s;tly by our&s;elves, nor to be rightly cho&s;en out of tho&s;e made by others; nor to be aptly applied,
<PB N="lxvi" REF="65">without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>rea&s;on;</HI> both together may &s;upport opinion and practice in the ab&s;ence of know|ledge and certainty; for tho&s;e ob&s;ervations upon the nature of men and things, which we have made our|&s;elves, we know; and our own rea&s;oning concerning them, and deductions from them, we know; and from hence there cannot but ari&s;e in many ca&s;es an internal obligation to give our a&s;&s;ent to this, rather than that, or to act one way rather than another: and as to the ob&s;ervations of others, they may be &s;o cautiou&s;ly and &s;killfully taken under our notice, as to become almo&s;t our own, &s;ince our own rea&s;on and experience may direct us in the choice and u&s;e of them.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Another kind of evidence, is the te&s;timony of others, and this is a large part of our knowledge. Ten thou&s;and things there are which we believe, merely upon the authority or credit of tho&s;e who have &s;poken or written of them; it is by this that mo&s;t of the tran&s;actions of human life are managed, we know the characters and laws of our pre&s;ent governors, as well as things that are at a va&s;t di&s;tance from us, in foreign nations, or in ancient ages: according as the per&s;ons who inform us of any thing, are many, or few, or more or le&s;s wi&s;e, and faithful, and credible, &s;o our faith is more or le&s;s firm or wavering, and the propo|&s;ition believed either certain or doubtful; but in matters of faith an exceeding great probability is called a moral certainty
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Watts's Logic, and Ditton on the Re&s;urrection.</NOTE>. Hi&s;tories written by faithful and credible authors, and read with judgment, may &s;up|ply us with examples, parallel ca&s;es, and general re|marks, for forming our manners and principles too; and by the frequent peru&s;al of them, and meditation upon them, a judicious judgment is formed of many dubious ca&s;es, and of matters of great importance.</P>
<P>To conclude, that we ought to follow probability in this ca&s;e, as well as the forementioned, is evident; becau&s;e where there is no greater certainty to be had,
<PB N="lxvii" REF="66">it becomes our only light and guide; and it mu&s;t be rea&s;onable to direct our &s;teps by probability, when we have nothing clearer to walk by; and, if it be rea&s;on|able, we are obliged to do it. When there is nothing in the oppo&s;ite &s;cale, or nothing of equal weight, this in the cour&s;e of nature mu&s;t turn the beam
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wolla&s;ton's Religion of Nature, p. 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>With regard to divine te&s;timony, though it comes under the denomination of the evidence of te&s;timony, is of a &s;uperior nature; and the a&s;&s;ent to a propo|&s;ition upon this evidence is &s;tiled <HI>divine faith,</HI> and &s;o far as we under&s;tand the meaning of this word it produces a &s;upernatural certainty, or an ab&s;olute in|fallible a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P N="7">VII. In&s;piration is a &s;ort of evidence di&s;tinct from all the former, and that is when &s;uch an overpower|ing impre&s;&s;ion of any propo&s;ition is made upon the mind by God him&s;elf, that gives a convincing and in|dubitable evidence of the truth and divinity of it. But as this is of the highe&s;t kind of evidence, chiefly, if not &s;olely, confined to the prophets, and &s;ome of the ear|lie&s;t apo&s;tles and fir&s;t propagators of chri&s;tianity, it is not &s;o applicable to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, to the nature of tho&s;e truths it concerns us to know in the &s;tate and circum&s;tances in which Divine Providence hath placed us. This kind of evidence has been &s;o often pretended to, either as working on the outward &s;en&s;es, or by impre&s;&s;ions on the imagination, &s;piritual feelings, &s;udden and powerful impul&s;es on the mind, whereby &s;ome per&s;ons have fancied a &s;uperior or divine light and power attending them, which they could neither explain or prove to the &s;atisfaction of rational and ju|dicious per&s;ons, that &s;uch preten&s;ions have been often, and, I think, very ju&s;tly exploded, as the effect of weakne&s;s and enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>The various kinds of evidence upon which we be|lieve any propo&s;ition, afford us the following remarks.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="lxviii" REF="67">I. That there are &s;ome propo&s;itions that admit of different kinds of evidence, and of which we have an unque&s;tionable certainty, and con&s;equently may be con&s;idered as fundamental truths, to direct our in|quiries and conduct.</P>
<P N="2">II. That, though &s;ome of the&s;e evidences are &s;upe|rior to others in their nature, and give a greater ground of certainty in &s;ome points, more immediately tho&s;e which are the &s;ubject of divine revelation; yet that rea&s;on in its own nature will always lead us into truth in matters within its compa&s;s, if it were u&s;ed aright, or it would require us to &s;u&s;pend our judge|ment where there is want of evidence; and it mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, and with equal certainty, be admitted, as the proper means to judge of the reality and degrees of other kinds of evidence, upon which any other pro|po&s;ition may pre&s;ent it&s;elf to our minds, and claim our a&s;&s;ent
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Nature of Moral Evidence, illu&s;trated in fifteen Pro|po&s;itions in Dicton's Di&s;cour&s;e of the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, from p. 123 to 164.</NOTE>. But it will al&s;o follow, that if the judgment be corrupted, and the under&s;tanding darkened, with re&s;pect to religious principles and moral truths, which concern the rectitude and ju&s;t conduct and true happi|ne&s;s of intelligent and free beings, he is then under as great an incapacity of rea&s;oning, and incapable to di&s;|cern the proper difference of actions and characters, as if he had been formed with a natural incapacity of rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Religion is wholly founded in rea&s;on, and directed by it; and therefore, when this light, this &s;acred and divine light, is not attended to; when imagination, pa&s;&s;ion, and prejudices and fal&s;e conceptions, u&s;urp the place, and are allowed all that authority and influence, which only belong to truth, and the dictates of a &s;ober well informed judgment, it mu&s;t unavoidably follow, that the truths of religion will be ob&s;cured by igno|rance
<PB N="lxix" REF="68">and prejudices, and its native beauty &s;ullied by extravagance and enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>But as this is a &s;ubject of the utmo&s;t importance, I &s;hall here take occa&s;ion to inquire into the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable and general cau&s;es, by which the light of rea|&s;on is ob&s;cured, and the judgment perverted and en|&s;laved; cau&s;es that have been the mo&s;t prevailing in all ages, and which, as long as they are allowed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, will in all future time have the &s;ame fatal effect.</P>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t of the&s;e that pre&s;ents it&s;elf to a mo&s;t &s;u|perficial ob&s;erver, is indolence and inattention: every one mu&s;t acknowledge, that it is not the mere faculty of rea&s;on that illuminates the mind; but the proper exerci&s;e and careful improvement of it, by frequent re|flection and impartial inquiry: for a man of the mo&s;t &s;trong and exten&s;ive natural abilities, who never thinks nor never examines, cannot be expected to make half the proficiency in divine knowledge as a more delibe|rate and ingenious inquirer of a much inferior under|&s;tanding; nay his judgment may be as weak and con|fu&s;ed, for want of proper care to inform it aright, and, thro' a &s;hameful negligence, his rea&s;on may be as gro&s;ly fallacious, and his principles as repugnant to common &s;en&s;e, as tho&s;e that find admittance where human rea&s;on is in a lower and imperfect &s;tate; &s;o that indolence, and, which are the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of it, lazine&s;s and &s;uperficial examination, are the certain foundation of error and intellectual darkne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">II. Another common cau&s;e of ignorance and mi&s;|takes in our inquiries, is prejudice, which throws a mi&s;t before the under&s;tanding, and hinders it from di&s;cerning clearly the evidences, and beauties, and ad|vantages of truth. It gives the judgment a parti|cular and &s;trong bias towards one &s;et of principles, which of con&s;equence are readily admitted as the be&s;t and mo&s;t rational; and the contrary truths, though of the mo&s;t momentous kind, are as naturally di&s;credited and vilified. The arguments by which they are re|commended
<PB N="lxx" REF="69">are dimini&s;hed, and con&s;idered as mere trifles; but the objections again&s;t them magnified, as de|ci&s;ive and unan&s;werable. Thus will prejudice, though of the mo&s;t gro&s;s and malignant kind, engro&s;s all the fairne&s;s, candour, and &s;kill in argument to it&s;elf, and paint on the &s;ide of truth and rea&s;on nothing but &s;uper|ficial knowledge, or narrowne&s;s of mind. The prejudices by which mankind are influenced, are various, but have all the &s;ame infatuating and blinding quality; for whe|ther it be prejudice ari&s;ing from education or intere&s;t, or the prejudice of implicit veneration for great names, whom we have been taught to call Rabbi, or an un|re&s;erved &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to human authority; which &s;oever of the&s;e bears the principal &s;way, it has always tended to the &s;ame point, and the effect of it has been this, making men conceited in ignorance, and ob&s;tinate in error.</P>
<P N="3">III. Sen&s;uality is a never-faling means of a darken|ing and perverting the judgment; for, by inflaming the pa&s;&s;ions, it indi&s;po&s;es the mind for the calm con|templation and pur&s;uit of truth in general. It de|pre&s;&s;es the very faculty of rea&s;on, and renders it unfit for &s;ublime exerci&s;es. It introduces a fal&s;e ta&s;te, and de&s;troys the reli&s;h of mental plea&s;ures; for &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on are &s;uch contrary principles, that if the gratifi|cation of the fir&s;t be our &s;urpreme and mo&s;t favourite entertainment, we &s;hall regard the latter &s;o much the le&s;s in proportion, and perhaps contract an utter aver&s;ion to its employments and exerci&s;es. But in an uncommon degree does &s;en&s;uality unfit for an impartial &s;tudy of religious and moral truth, after which it begets a pre|judice of which it mu&s;t needs entertain &s;ome kind of horror, as of a reprover, a condemner, an awakener of guilty &s;u&s;picions, and a &s;courge of unlawful exce&s;&s;es. To what a &s;ad condition mu&s;t that man be reduced, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition and conduct in a manner force him to dread and fly from thinking, that he may be the more quiet|ly and &s;erenely mi&s;erable?</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="lxxi" REF="70">IV. Next to &s;en&s;uality, the mo&s;t univer&s;al corrupter of good principles, and extingui&s;her of rea&s;on's light, is &s;uper&s;tition. It alarms with panic terrors, and makes a man afraid of free inquiry, as if hone&s;ty, and ingenuity of mind, which are the very e&s;&s;ence and genuine &s;pirit of an acceptable virtue and piety, were crimes that de&s;erved damnation; and an abject &s;lavi&s;h credulity, which is a reproach to the character of a man, was however the chief excellence and duty of re|ligion, and the &s;ure&s;t recommendation to the e&s;teem and favour of the Diety. Super&s;tition always proceeds from weakne&s;s of mind; it &s;uppo&s;es the under&s;tanding to be di&s;turbed, and fancy or fear, or pre&s;umption, to have the a&s;cendant; and as the&s;e prevail farther, the judgment will be more and more deba&s;ed, and the in|tellectual darkne&s;s proportionably increa&s;ed; and when once a man hath brought him&s;elf to believe in earne&s;t that the great God of the univer&s;e is a weak, capricious Being, plea&s;ed and offended with trifles; that the di&s;|honouring human rea&s;on, by &s;ub&s;tituting forms, bo|dily ge&s;tures, or penances, in the room of the reforma|tion of evil habits and inward rectitude, and practi&s;ing ceremonies of devotion, equally ab&s;urd and u&s;ele&s;s, is the way in which he chu&s;es to be &s;erved and wor&s;hipped; when once a man has brought him&s;elf really to believe the&s;e are great and important points, in which reli|gion con&s;i&s;ts, he &s;eems to have lo&s;t the common prin|ciples of rea&s;on. And it is no wonder to find that &s;u|per&s;tition, which abounds in infinite in&s;tances in a like kind, is lo&s;t in confu&s;ion, and goes on from one de|gree of folly and extravagance to another, till, in the end, it quite obliterates all rational &s;en&s;e of God, and of his wor&s;hip, and the very natural con&s;cience of good and evil. Fal&s;e notions of God, the ba&s;is and &s;upport of &s;uper&s;tition, are fundamental errors, which de&s;troy the ground-work of all true judgment about virtue and piety, and on which no &s;uper&s;tructure can be rai&s;ed &s;uited to the foundation, that has any thing in it but
<PB N="lxxii" REF="71">weakne&s;s and fal&s;hood; and therefore, while &s;uch errors are unhappily entertained, it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible in nature that any other con&s;equence &s;hould follow than this, that, with re&s;pect to religion, the grand con|cern of human life, the light that is in us will be total darkne&s;s
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ab&s;tract from Dr. Fo&s;ter of Revealed Religion, vol. I.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal cau&s;es of that ignorance and error that have &s;o much prevailed in the world; but there are a variety of others, which are either preven|tive of inquiry, or impediments that ob&s;truct the acqui|&s;ition of truth; which though I would not be tedious in expatiating upon, yet the mention of &s;ome of them may have its u&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the want of forming in our minds &s;ome proper principles and rules of judging concerning truths in general or particular. Want of due reflection upon tho&s;e ideas we have, or may have, and u&s;ing words and phra&s;es that have no fixed determinate ideas, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be de&s;titute of that knowledge which might otherwi&s;e be gained from the contempla|tion of them and their relations. Attempting to judge of things quite above our reach, whereby our ideas are confu&s;ed, and a&s;&s;ert or deny without being at all able to demon&s;trate the truth or fal&s;ity of the propo|&s;ition. Not under&s;tanding wherein the force of an argument or ju&s;t con&s;equence con&s;i&s;ts, from whence it comes to pa&s;s that per&s;ons a&s;&s;ert &s;uch a thing to follow from &s;uch a po&s;ition, when it is no axiom, no theorem, no truth, that we know of. Defect of memory and imagination, which is often &s;hallow, treacherous, confu&s;ed, and cannot be depended upon. Attending too much to &s;en&s;e; for as nece&s;&s;ary as our &s;en&s;es are to us, there are certainly many things which fall not within their notice; many which cannot be exhibited after the manner of &s;en&s;ible objects, and to which no images belong. Want of retirement, and the practice of thinking and rea&s;oning by our&s;elves: Truth is the offspring of &s;ilence, unbroken meditation,
<PB N="lxxiii" REF="72">and thoughts often revi&s;ed and corrected. A fond|ne&s;s for our own opinions, in which we chanced to be educated, that have been inculcated by parents or tu|tors, that have the &s;tamp of antiquity, or the &s;anction of public authority. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, if they may be called &s;uch, many have not only &s;hewn an indifference as to true principles, but have refu&s;ed even to hear any arguments again&s;t their favourite imbibed opinions; though, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, had they been born in an idolatrous, Mahommedan, or Popi&s;h country, they mu&s;t have been of the religion in which they were edu|cated. La&s;tly, if per&s;ons of this turn of mind have at any time permitted the &s;ound of truth in their ears, and have been led to think or inquire at all, it has been &s;o &s;uperficial, and under the influence of &s;uch prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and bigotry, as have proved the hinder|ance of their illumination and conviction.</P>
<P>But perhaps it will be a&s;ked, are there not many dif|ficulties that ob&s;truct the acqui&s;ition of truth in gene|ral, involuntary and unavoidable, ari&s;ing from the de|pravity of human rea&s;on? Rea&s;on, it is &s;aid, which was once the dignity and glory of human nature, is now depraved, weakened and enfeebled by our original defection, &s;o that it is at be&s;t a very uncertain guide with re&s;pect to truth or happine&s;s. But however de|praved and di&s;abled by the fall, he is &s;till capable of di&s;cerning what is right or wrong in every ca&s;e which properly concerns him; man is &s;till capable of extend|ing his inquiries very far into other concerns; can &s;earch deep into the rece&s;&s;es of nature, and by &s;teady. careful inquiry, joined with experience, explain many ab&s;tru&s;e points in the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, and illu&s;|trate the wi&s;e laws and wonderful di&s;po&s;itions of pro|vidence; and can it be imagined that our own proper duty as men, and truths that are of importance for us to know, are placed beyond the reach of our under|&s;tanding? This would be rendering the &s;tate of man de|plorable indeed, and reflect on the wi&s;dom and care of
<PB N="lxxiv" REF="73">the Divine Providence. And as to the doctrines and duties of revelation, they mu&s;t be capable of arriving at the true &s;en&s;e of the&s;e too, unle&s;s it be a revelation unrevealed; taking it for granted, as it is clearly a doctrine of the New Te&s;tament, that whatever de|grees of divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance is nece&s;&s;ary in aid to our fa|culties, they are always afforded to the diligent and well-di&s;po&s;ed. If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, how can we po&s;|&s;ibly know that tho&s;e inward impre&s;&s;ions that we feel, are really divine? The an&s;wer mu&s;t be, from their corre&s;pondence with the eternal revelation, and with the light and dictates of rea&s;on. And from hence it will follow, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our faculties, however impaired and di&s;ordered, we are capable of acquiring a deep and lively impre&s;&s;ion of moral and divine truths. For is it out of the power of a man to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly? Is it beyond his natural abilities, to reflect often on affairs of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence? Can he have a ju&s;t theory of the Chri&s;tian religion, and at the &s;ame time not be convinced of its intrin&s;ic excel|lence, and infinite importance? Such an in&s;inuation as this redounds as little to the credit of chri&s;tianity, as to the honour of human nature.</P>
<P>Should it be &s;aid that man, by the original bias of his nature to evil, and its aver&s;ion to what is good, is nece&s;&s;arily di&s;inclined to, and indi&s;po&s;ed for reflection on &s;uch &s;ubjects as the&s;e; I an&s;wer, the &s;tronge&s;t di&s;|inclination does by no means infer an utter impo&s;&s;ibi|lity; nay, the contrary is mo&s;t evident: for let the in|di&s;po&s;ition be equal to what is &s;ugge&s;ted in the objec|tion, man mu&s;t &s;till be a free agent, and have it in his power to be either virtuous or vicious, or el&s;e he is ab|&s;olutely incapable both of religion and moral govern|ment; and can we imagine that our nature is &s;o odd, and &s;o defective a compo&s;ition, as to be capable of forming many good re&s;olutions, and of rectifying ma|ny errors of conduct in civil life, and, at the &s;ame time, indi&s;po&s;ed and unable to act the part of a rational,
<PB N="lxxv" REF="74">moral and intelligent being, in matters of a religious nature?</P>
<P>Here it may be proper to take notice of the princi|pal cau&s;es of corruptions in chri&s;tianity, which are ge|nerally urged as another &s;ource of difficulty in the &s;earch after religious truth, and in the &s;tudy and right under&s;tanding the &s;criptures, in a way of private judg|ment.</P>
<P>When chri&s;tianity was fir&s;t promulgated to the world, it &s;tood upon the principles of rea&s;on and com|mon &s;en&s;e; and happy would it have been for man|kind, if they had but &s;uffered it to remain upon this foundation. But men were no &s;ooner drawn over to it, than, de&s;erting their natural notions of things, they be|gan to explain it upon artificial notions. The great misfortune was, that many of its fir&s;t converts came from the &s;chools of the philo&s;ophers; and being pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with fanta&s;tic opinions and &s;y&s;tems of their own, they began to garni&s;h, and new-model it, ac|cording to every man's ta&s;te and humour. A plain, &s;imple religion, &s;uch as the Chri&s;tian, founded upon the principle of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, was too in|&s;ipid of it&s;elf, and wanted &s;ea&s;oning with philo&s;ophy, before it could be reli&s;hed by tho&s;e primitive prelates. Here was the foundation of every here&s;y, and the &s;ource of all that &s;purious mixture, which corrupted the purity of the go&s;pel, &s;o &s;oon after its e&s;tabli&s;hment. The philo&s;ophy of Plato was the fir&s;t in vogue among&s;t Chri&s;tians; and this &s;eems to have happened, not only becau&s;e this philo&s;ophy was imagined to bear &s;ome di&s;|tant re&s;emblance to chri&s;tianity; but al&s;o becau&s;e it was the be&s;t calculated to flatter that enthu&s;ia&s;tic turn of mind, which unhappily prevailed in tho&s;e early times.</P>
<P>If then we would &s;hew our&s;elves wi&s;e men and good Chri&s;tians, let us be concerned only for truth; and in order to find it, con&s;ider calmly, and examine im|partially; let not indolence enervate and &s;tupify our minds, let not prejudice captivate and en&s;lave us; let

But here again a con&s;iderable dif|ficulty occurs, and that is, how we can po&s;&s;ibly know that this inward teaching is really divine, but from its corre&s;pondence with the external revelation, and with the light and dictates of rea&s;on; and con&s;equently without admitting that the external revelation may be under&s;tood without it, and that rea&s;on is the eternal &s;tandard of truth.</P>
<P>But there are a variety of difficulties &s;tarted, that ob|&s;truct the knowledge of the true &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, which de&s;erve to be taken notice of in this place.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 1. It is &s;aid the New Te&s;tament cannot be well under&s;tood without the Old, which was for the mo&s;t part wrote in Hebrew, and for the under&s;tanding of which a good knowledge of the oriental language is nece&s;&s;ary. That a great part of the &s;criptures are wrote in a &s;tile extremely figurative; and tho&s;e fi|gures, &s;uch as this part of the world are very great &s;trangers to; and con&s;equently the ver&s;ion of books,
<PB N="lxxxii" REF="81">little under&s;tood from their language and &s;tile, mu&s;t be extremely difficult. And if the knowledge of the Old Te&s;tament could be di&s;pen&s;ed with, the language of the New Te&s;tament is not to be under&s;tood without much pains. The &s;tile indeed, in the hi&s;torical part, is plain; yet there are great difficulties in the doctrinal parts. The whole is wrote in the &s;tile adapted to the Jews, and the idiom is Hebrew or Syriac, though the words be Greek, which renders &s;ome knowledge of this language the more nece&s;&s;ary. I might add, that it requires a good knowledge of the Jewi&s;h &s;tate, at the time of our Saviour's coming; a knowledge of their government, Sanhedrim, &s;ynagogue wor&s;hip, cu&s;|toms, traditions, opinions, &s;ects, &amp;c. A farther dif|ficulty ari&s;es from the &s;ublimity of &s;ome of its peculiar doctrines, and the excellency of &s;ome of its precepts, as appearing incongruous to their antient maxims, principles, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> As to the difficulties ari&s;ing from the lan|guages, a common critic will make &s;ome allowances for the deficiencies and redundancies that might be pointed out in books of &s;uch great antiquity, as the books of the Old Te&s;tament confe&s;&s;edly are: and when &s;everal of tho&s;e books treat of the &s;ame matters, and relate the &s;ame facts, a candid reader will &s;upply what appears deficient in one, by what appears com|pleat in the other; and more e&s;pecially when we can attain to the general view and de&s;ign, make the mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction of &s;uch as appears har&s;h and difficult, and content our&s;elves with being unable to account for &s;ome &s;eeming contradictions, as in many ca&s;es it may be &s;een to be an omi&s;&s;ion in the tran&s;cri|ber. Thus, 2 Sam. xxiv. 1. it is written, The anger of the Lord was kindled again&s;t I&s;rael, and he moved David again&s;t them to &s;ay, Go number I&s;rael and Judah. And 1 Chron. xxi. 1. it is &s;aid, And Satan
<PB N="lxxxiii" REF="82">&s;tood up again&s;t I&s;rael, and provoked David to num|ber I&s;rael; and God was di&s;plea&s;ed with the thing; v. 7. therefore he &s;mote I&s;rael. And &s;ome of the pro|phecies of &s;cripture, with their application, &s;eems to &s;tand in need of the &s;ame candid compari&s;on of &s;crip|tures, and other circum&s;tances, to come at the right knowledge of them. The relation given of &s;ome par|ticulars in our Saviour's life and doctrine, are in &s;ome minute circum&s;tances differently related by the Evangeli&s;ts; but in no material and e&s;&s;ential points.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is plain the orthodox faith is not founded on a nice and critical knowledge of the &s;crip|ture; many of the primitive Chri&s;tians were no great critics, but argued very much in a my&s;tical way. Origen in particular, who was the greate&s;t &s;cholar chri&s;tianity had bred to that time, perpetually turns the letter of &s;cripture into allegory; from whence we may rea&s;onably conclude, that the knowledge of the pure literal &s;en&s;e was, in the judgment of many, even in tho&s;e times, thought to be of little u&s;e.</P>
<P>But it is certain, that the original language of the Old Te&s;tament was known to very few for the fir&s;t &s;ix centuries, in which tho&s;e general councils were held, wherein all the articles of the orthodox faith were &s;et|tled; they governed them&s;elves, and determined all their points by the Greek ver&s;ion. Now, if an exact and critical knowledge of the &s;criptures was not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the &s;ettling the faith, it cannot be nece&s;&s;ary to the under&s;tanding it, or to the under&s;tanding tho&s;e who have wrote in the explication of it: on the con|trary, &s;uch a knowledge tends to le&s;&s;en our e&s;teem of the fathers of the church, by di&s;covering their mi&s;|takes, and mu&s;t weaken our regard to the deci&s;ion of councils, by expo&s;ing the fal&s;ene&s;s of the ground they &s;eem to be built on. A man well &s;killed in the fathers and councils, will often find texts of &s;cripture are very in&s;ufficiently or improperly applied; which &s;ugge&s;t

<P>Our learned author likewi&s;e enumerates many other arguments again&s;t an exact and careful &s;tudy of the &s;criptures, as, 1. That the &s;ub&s;tance of the orthodox faith is compri&s;ed in the liturgy and articles of the church of England; which is a &s;hort way as could be wi&s;hed for, knowing all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be known, e&s;pecially as this will lead to the knowledge of all u&s;e|ful truths, without the hazard of falling into any dan|gerous opinions. 2. As it is a fundamental principle among Prote&s;tants, that whatever is nece&s;&s;ary to be believed is plainly revealed in the &s;criptures, and con|&s;equently what is not plainly and clearly revealed in them, cannot be nece&s;&s;ary: now if what is plain and clear in &s;cripture, is the only part nece&s;&s;ary to be known; then a laborious &s;earch into the ob&s;curer parts may &s;eem unnece&s;&s;ary, to the obtaining a true orthodox faith. 3.

<PB N="lxxxv" REF="84">taken, and that he is all his life bound by the &s;ub|&s;criptions made in his fir&s;t years, as if a man was as wi&s;e at twenty-four, and knew as much of &s;cripture and antiquity, as at fifty; and yet if he continues the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures, he is not &s;ure he &s;hall conti|nue a year together in the &s;ame &s;entiments.

Every mean per&s;on, who has nothing to re|commend him but his orthodoxy, and owes that per|haps wholly to his ignorance, will think he has a right to trample on you with contempt, and a&s;per&s;e your character with violent reflections, without your having the lea&s;t hopes of being heard in your own defence.</P>
<P>Our worthy prelates, after the&s;e remarks, and more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, by way of reprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e mini&s;ters who&s;e conduct have run counter to their duty and profe&s;&s;ion, make the&s;e candid conce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>After all that has been &s;aid, I am per&s;uaded that many readers will &s;till think what is here advanced, a &s;trange paradox, or perhaps be &s;candalized at it as a very wicked one; and will on no terms allow, that clergymen &s;hould lay a&s;ide what ought to be their chief &s;tudy. And, to be ingenuous, I will confe&s;s I am en|tirely of the &s;ame mind; I am as unwilling as they can be, to admit the conclu&s;ion, that the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures &s;hould be de&s;erted; and yet cannot deny, but, humanly &s;peaking, this mu&s;t be the con&s;equence from the premi&s;&s;es. If therefore we will not allow the conclu&s;ion, we mu&s;t &s;how the premi&s;&s;es to be un|true, and that this &s;tudy will not be attended with &s;o
<PB N="lxxxvi" REF="85">much danger. But this we in vain attempt, if we do not our parts at lea&s;t, that the&s;e may not be the con|&s;equences. For as long as they are, the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures will certainly continue to be neglected, as it now is, and all men who contribute to the&s;e con&s;e|quences in any degree, do &s;o far di&s;courage the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures, whatever they pretend.</P>
<P>In truth, there is nothing more ab&s;urd, than to &s;ay the glorious things we do daily of the Scriptures; and, at the &s;ame time, make the &s;tudy of them, to men of &s;incere and hone&s;t minds, &s;o extremely hazar|dous and inconvenient. If then we would not be guilty of di&s;couraging a &s;tudy, which we acknowledge to be the great duty of the clergy, as we are Chri&s;|tians; if we would be true to the fundamental prin|ciples of the reformation, as Prote&s;tants, that the &s;criptures are the only rule of faith; let us u&s;e our be&s;t endeavours to remove the great ob&s;tacles that lie again&s;t the &s;tudy of them; let us do what we can, that learned men may have full liberty to &s;tudy the &s;crip|tures freely and impartially; good encouragement given them to go through the labour and difficulties of &s;uch a &s;tudy, not &s;lightly and &s;uperficially, but with &s;uch ap|plication and diligence as the nature of the thing re|quires; and have leave to &s;peak their &s;en&s;e with all manner of &s;afety: that their opinions may be ex|amined fairly and with temper: that their names be not unju&s;tly loaded with calumny and &s;lander: that their words and actions may be interpreted with the &s;ame candour, as is &s;hown to tho&s;e that differ from them: that, if what they advance be right, it may be received; if wrong, their errors may be refuted, as the mi&s;takes of learned men on other &s;ubjects; if doubtful, and the &s;criptures &s;ay &s;o little, or &s;peak &s;o ob&s;curely, that nothing can certainly be decided either way, that then no body may be obliged to take either &s;ide as nece&s;&s;ary: that, whether their notions be right or wrong, their per&s;ons may in all events be fafe, and
<PB N="lxxxvii" REF="86">their maintenance not affected by it: that, as long as they live virtuou&s;ly, and write with all due mode&s;ty, good manners, and advance nothing that breaks in upon morality and government, they be treated in all re&s;pects as tho&s;e are or ought to be who employ them|&s;elves in any other part of u&s;eful learning.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t add, let them be never &s;o much in the wrong, I can apprehend no danger from it to the church; or that the errors of a few men, can have any con&s;ider|able influence in oppo&s;ition to a great body of a vi|gilant and learned clergy, who will be always able and ready to defend the received notions, if they can be defended; and if they cannot, it mu&s;t be allowed they ought not. But if &s;ome inconveniences would ari&s;e from the liberty I contend for, they are nothing in compari&s;on of tho&s;e that mu&s;t follow from the want of it.</P>
<P>Till there is &s;uch a liberty allowed to clergymen, till there is &s;uch a &s;ecurity for their reputations, for|tunes and per&s;ons, I fear I mu&s;t add, till &s;o difficult a &s;tudy meets with proportionable encouragement; it is impo&s;&s;ible a &s;incere, impartial and laborious appli|cation to it, &s;hould generally prevail: and till it does, it is as impo&s;&s;ible the &s;criptures &s;hould be well under|&s;tood; and till they are, they are a rule of faith in name only. For it is not the word of &s;cripture, but the &s;en&s;e, which is the rule; and &s;o far as that is not under&s;tood, &s;o far the &s;criptures are not our rule, whatever we pretend, but the &s;en&s;e that men have put on them; men fallible as our&s;elves, and who were by no means &s;o well furni&s;hed, as the learned at pre&s;ent are, with the proper helps to find out the true mean|ing of &s;cripture. And while we take the &s;en&s;e of the &s;criptures in this manner upon content, and &s;ee not with our own eyes; we in&s;en&s;ibly relap&s;e into the principle of popery, and give up the only ground on which we can ju&s;tify our &s;eparation from the church of Rome. It was a right to &s;tudy and judge of the
<PB N="lxxxviii" REF="87">&s;criptures for them&s;elves, that our fir&s;t reformers a&s;|&s;erted with &s;o good effect; and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors can defend their adherence to them on no other principle.</P>
<P>If then we are concerned for the &s;tudy of the &s;crip|tures, further than in words; if we in earne&s;t think them the only rule of faith; let us act as if we thought &s;o, let us heartily encourage a free impartial &s;tudy of them; let us lay a&s;ide that malignant, arbitrary, per|&s;ecuting, popi&s;h &s;pirit; let us put no fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ters on mens under&s;tandings, nor any other bounds to their inquiries, but what God and truth have &s;et. Let us, if we would not give up the Prote&s;tant principle, that the &s;criptures are plain and clear in the nece&s;&s;ary articles, declare nothing to be nece&s;&s;ary, but what is clearly revealed in them.</P>
<P>Then may we hope to &s;ee the &s;tudy of the&s;e divine books &s;o happily cultivated by the united labours of the learned, when under no di&s;couragements, that all may in the main agree in the true meaning of them. Places that can be under&s;tood, they will agree in un|der&s;tanding alike; &s;uch at lea&s;t as are of con&s;equence to the faith. And for &s;uch as are too ob&s;cure to be cleared up with any certainty, tho&s;e likewi&s;e they will agree about, and unanimou&s;ly confe&s;s they are &s;uch as no article of faith can be grounded upon, or proved from. Next to under&s;tanding a text of &s;cripture, is to know it cannot be certainly under&s;tood. When the clear and dark parts of &s;cripture are thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, an unity may then rea&s;onably be hoped for among Prote&s;tants in nece&s;&s;ary points; and a difference of opinion in &s;uch as are not nece&s;&s;ary, can have no manner of ill con&s;e|quence, nor any way di&s;turb the peace of the church; &s;ince there will then be nothing left in its doctrines, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o inflame mens pa&s;&s;ions, or feed their corrupt intere&s;ts, when we are all agreed about what is e&s;&s;ential to religion; and what is not e&s;&s;ential, is looked on as indif|ferent; &s;o that a man may take one &s;ide, or the other,
<PB N="lxxxix" REF="88">or neither, or may change, as he &s;ees rea&s;on, without offence.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, a free and impartial &s;tudy of the &s;criptures, either ought to be encouraged, or it ought not. There is no medium; and therefore tho&s;e who are again&s;t one &s;ide, which ever it be, are nece&s;&s;arily e&s;pou&s;ers of the other. Tho&s;e who think it ought not to be encouraged, will, I hope, think it no injury to be thought to defend their opinion upon &s;uch rea&s;ons as have here been brought for it, till they give better. On the other hand, tho&s;e who think the&s;e rea&s;ons in|conclu&s;ive, and cannot find better, will find them|&s;elves obliged to confe&s;s, that &s;uch a &s;tudy ought to be encouraged; and con&s;equently mu&s;t take care how they are acce&s;&s;ary to &s;uch practices, as in their natural con&s;equence cannot but tend to its di&s;couragement; le&s;t they come into the condemnation of tho&s;e who love darkne&s;s rather than light, and for their puni&s;h|ment be finally adjudged to it. There is in this ca&s;e no other medium between encouraging, and di&s;cou|raging, but what there is between light and darkne&s;s. Every degree of darkne&s;s, is a want of &s;o much light, and all want of light, is a certain degree of darkne&s;s. To refu&s;e then a greater degree of light where it can be had, is in truth to prefer darkne&s;s; which, in my humble opinion, can never be rea&s;onable or excu&s;able. Tho&s;e who are of another mind, plainly di&s;tru&s;t them|&s;elves or their cau&s;e. Which if it can bear the light, why &s;hould it not be &s;hown in it? but if it cannot, it is not the cau&s;e of God, or of the Son of God; for God is light, and in him is no darkne&s;s; and the Son of God is the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world

<P>This is a point I apprehend incapable of being de|termined, as it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily depend on, and will ever

<P>Bi&s;hop U&s;her &s;ays, as for the <HI>credenda,</HI> or things nece&s;&s;ary to be believed, the Creed, called the Apo&s;tles, contained all articles of that kind, as is manife&s;t from the continual practice of the Catholic church. For when &s;he prepared her catechumens for bapti&s;m, and there|upon received them to that ordinance, and into the Chri&s;tian church, we cannot rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e &s;he omitted any thing to make them members; and yet all that &s;he required of them to believe, were the articles of this creed.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>agenda,</HI> or things nece&s;&s;ary to be done, in order to &s;alvation, he &s;ays, among all the great diffe|rences we &s;ee in the practice of Chri&s;tians, there are certain fundamental points in which they all agree; as, a de&s;ire to fear God; repentance for &s;ins pa&s;t, and a &s;in|cere purpo&s;e of heart, for the time to come, to cleave unto the Lord; which who&s;oever have is under mercy, and ought not to be excluded the communion of the faithful Chri&s;tians

<P><PB N="xci" REF="90">Dr. Potter, who &s;ays, that what man or church &s;oever believes the Creed, and all the evident con&s;equences of it &s;incerely and heartily, cannot po&s;&s;ibly (if al&s;o he be|lieves the &s;cripture) be in any error of &s;imple belief, offen&s;ive to God, nor therefore de&s;erve for any &s;uch error to be deprived of his life, or to be cut off from the communion of the church, and deemed unworthy of &s;alvation. And the con&s;equence is this, which highly concerns the church of Rome, that what&s;oever man or church does for any error of &s;imple belief, deprive any man &s;o qualified as above, either of his temporal life, or livelihood, or liberty, or of the churches com|munion, and hope of &s;alvation, is for the fir&s;t, unju&s;t, cruel and tyrannical, &s;chi&s;matical and pre&s;umptuous; and for the &s;econd, uncharitable.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Gib&s;on has delivered his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject with much clearne&s;s, candour and charity; he &s;ays, as long as men are men, and have different de|grees of under&s;tanding, and every one a partiality <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his own conceptions, it is not to be expected that they &s;hould agree in any one entire &s;cheme, and every part of it, in the circum&s;tances, as well as in the things them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion therefore is not in general about a difference in opinion, which in our pre&s;ent &s;tate is un|avoidable; but about the very weight and importance of the things wherein Chri&s;tians differ, and the things wherein they agree; and it will appear that the &s;everal denominations of Chri&s;tians agree, both in the &s;ub|&s;tance of religion, and in the nece&s;&s;ary enforcements to the practice of it: "That the world, and all things in it, were created by God, and are under the direction and government of his powerful hand and all-&s;eeing eye; that there is an e&s;&s;ential difference between good and evil, virtue and vice; that there will be a &s;tate of future rewards and puni&s;hments, according to our behaviour in this life; that Chri&s;t was a teacher &s;ent from God, and that the apo&s;tles were divinely
<PB N="xcii" REF="91">in&s;pired; that all Chri&s;tians are bound to profe&s;s them|&s;elves to be his di&s;ciples; that not only the exerci&s;e of the &s;everal virtues, but belief in Chri&s;t, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to their obtaining the pardon of &s;in, the favour of God, and eternal life; that the wor&s;hip of God is to be performed chiefly by the heart in prayers, prai&s;es and thank&s;giving; and as to all other points, that they are bound to live by the rules which Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles have left them in the holy &s;criptures. Here, &s;ays this right reverend prelate, is a fixed, certain uniform rule of faith and practice, containing all the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary points of religion, e&s;tabli&s;hed by a divine &s;anction, embraced as &s;uch by all denominations of Chri&s;tians, and in it&s;elf abundantly &s;ufficient to pre|&s;erve the knowledge and practice of religion in the world.</P>
<P>Profe&s;&s;or Turretin, of Geneva, has laid down the following principles to di&s;tingui&s;h fundamentals,</P>
<P N="1">I. That we are not under a nece&s;&s;ary obligation to know, or believe any truth, but what is clearly re|vealed unto us, and for the belief of which God hath endowed us with nece&s;&s;ary abilities.</P>
<P N="2">II. That he alone who is Lord of life and death, that is, God, has power to determine what is nece&s;&s;ary to be believed, in order to obtain &s;alvation; and what error &s;hall exclude men from it.</P>
<P N="3">III. Tho&s;e things likewi&s;e which flow from the&s;e principles, by plain and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, mu&s;t be added to the catalogue of fundamentals, or things nece&s;&s;ary to be known.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Fundamentals are plain, adapted to common capacities.</P>
<P N="5">V. They mu&s;t be few in number.</P>
<P N="6">VI. They mu&s;t be often and variou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed in &s;cripture.</P>
<P N="7">VII. They are principles of, or tending to promote piety.</P>
<P>Finally, with re&s;pect to our&s;elves; our &s;afe&s;t way
<PB N="xciii" REF="92">is to guard again&s;t all errors, as though they were fundamental, and to make the utmo&s;t progre&s;s in the knowledge of divine truths; but with regard to others, we ought to pronounce nothing indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, but with the utmo&s;t caution, charity and meekne&s;s

<P>Dr. Fo&s;ter, in his definition of fundamentals, &s;ays, No article can be fundamental, but what is &s;o clearly and di&s;tinctly revealed, as that an ordinary Chri&s;tian, &s;incere in his inquiries, cannot mi&s;s of the knowledge of it.</P>
<P>Secondly, that it is not &s;ufficient that a propo&s;ition be clearly revealed to make it a fundamental, but the belief of it mu&s;t al&s;o be made an expre&s;s term of happine&s;s in the &s;acred writings
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Fo&s;ter's Di&s;cour&s;e of Fundamentals, p. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="1">1. No doctrine is a fundamental, but what is &s;o plainly and di&s;tinctly revealed, as that an ordinary Chri&s;tian, &s;incere in his inquiries, cannot mi&s;s of the knowledge of it. This may be argued from the per|fections of God, and the relations he &s;tands in to man|kind: for certainly their kind Creator and Pre&s;erver cannot but delight in, and &s;incerely de&s;ire their hap|pine&s;s; and therefore it is not to be doubted but that he has done every thing to promote it, which is con|&s;i&s;tent with his illu&s;trious excellence and perfection, and with the wi&s;dom of his government over free crea|tures. He cannot have fixed it upon &s;uch infinite un|certainties, as that they may fail of obtaining it after the mo&s;t &s;incere and diligent u&s;e of all the means they are capable of u&s;ing, but mu&s;t have made it certainly and infallibly attainable by every one who &s;eeks it in the integrity of his heart. What can induce us to think the mo&s;t good-natured Being in the univer&s;e to be &s;uch a hard ma&s;ter? Has there been any want of good|ne&s;s
<PB N="xciv" REF="93">in his di&s;pen&s;ations towards mankind, which might tempt us to entertain &s;uch unworthy and injurious thoughts of him? Again, can he who has been at &s;uch amazing expence to redeem the human race from that de&s;truction which their &s;ins had merited, and to rai&s;e our nature to its highe&s;t perfection of excellence and happine&s;s; who, that he might be ju&s;t to his being and attributes, and yet ju&s;tify and &s;ave us, delivered up his Son to death for us all; can he, I &s;ay, have left it &s;o ab&s;olutely precarious, whether poor, illiterate men, (who are the far greate&s;t part of the world) to whom e&s;pecially the go&s;pel was preached, and con|&s;equently to who&s;e capacities it ought to have been peculiarly adapted, &s;hall, doing their be&s;t, be happy or mi&s;erable? How then can the grand end of the life, death, re&s;urrection, and go&s;pel of his Son be an&s;wered? Or finally, has he ever been found fal&s;e to his word, or failed of the accompli&s;hment of his promi&s;es, that his mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;acred declarations of his willingne&s;s, that all men &s;hould be &s;aved and come to the know|ledge of the truth, &s;hould be looked upon as in&s;incere, and he be repre&s;ented as having promi&s;ed happine&s;s to the greate&s;t part of mankind, if not upon ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible conditions, upon conditions next to im|po&s;&s;ible?</P>
<P N="2">2. It is not &s;ufficient that a doctrine be clearly revealed to make it a fundamental; but an explicit belief of it mu&s;t be made an expre&s;s term of happine&s;s in the &s;acred writings. For, without doubt, there are a great many clear propo&s;itions, which many &s;incere, hone&s;t Chri&s;tians have no explicit belief of: nor is it nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould, &s;ince they are purely incidental, and occa&s;ional; and either do not at all affect chri&s;ti|anity in any important points of doctrine, or practice; or if they are of con&s;equence, it is only as they &s;erve to illu&s;trate the e&s;&s;ential, fundamental parts of it, which yet may be believed, though they are never ob&s;erved, or attended to. I grant indeed, that when|ever
<PB N="xcv" REF="94">a Chri&s;tian &s;ees them to be clearly revealed, he is obliged to believe them: but then it is not becau&s;e the points of doctrine are in them&s;elves &s;o important, as that mens &s;alvation, or damnation, will be deter|mined ab&s;olutely by their knowledge, or ignorance of them; but becau&s;e they are (as he thinks) in the word of God, who is omni&s;cient, and &s;o cannot be deceived him&s;elf, ju&s;t and faithful, and &s;o cannot impo&s;e upon his creatures; and there is &s;till this difference between any of the&s;e propo&s;itions, and tho&s;e which are, in the &s;en&s;e above-mentioned, fundamental, that a man may be &s;aved without explicit and particular belief of the&s;e; whereas the others are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to be ex|plicitly believed, as being the e&s;&s;ential, con&s;titutive parts of the new covenant.</P>
<P>And now, methinks, it &s;hould be pa&s;t di&s;pute, not only that Chri&s;t alone, as &s;ole king of his church, has a right to &s;ettle, upon what terms tho&s;e who are willing to become his &s;ubjects, mu&s;t expect to be protected and rewarded by him; but that the&s;e terms are expre&s;sly determined; and particularly, that our Lord, out of his gracious and kind concern for <HI>his church, which he hath purcha&s;ed with his own blood, Acts</HI> xx. 28. hath fully and clearly revealed what tho&s;e truths are, which are of &s;uch va&s;t importance, as that the happine&s;s of immortal &s;ouls depends upon an ex|plicit belief of them, and which therefore it &s;o nearly concerns all the members of it to be apprized of. So that we may re&s;t &s;atisfied, that whenever this is not expre&s;sly &s;aid, with relation to any particular doc|trine of chri&s;tianity, mi&s;apprehen&s;ions of that part of the revelations, which contains it, (if we have exa|mined it with &s;incerity) will never be brought into the account again&s;t us at the day of judgment; but if we can be charged with nothing el&s;e, we &s;hall be able to lift up our heads with joy and confidence in that &s;o|lemn and awful day of trial, and &s;hall be found per|fect and entire, in a go&s;pel-&s;en&s;e wanting nothing.</P>

<P>What ju&s;t foundation for prai&s;e is there in a man's being of the true religion? a Chri&s;tian, &s;uppo&s;e by chance, without knowing the grounds of his religion, and the rea&s;on of his hope, merely becau&s;e his ance&s;|tors were Chri&s;tians, and chri&s;tianity is the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; upon the &s;ame foot he might have been of a fal&s;e religion, a Mahommedan, or an Idolater.</P>
<P>Religion therefore is only &s;o far prai&s;e-worthy as it is the matter of our choice; and &s;ince religion is the means of procuring us acceptance with God, it nece&s;|&s;arily follows, that every man has an undoubted right to judge for him&s;elf

<P>None therefore can have any right to impo&s;e their par|ticular &s;en&s;e of, or authoritatively explain tho&s;e articles of faith and terms of &s;alvation, which Chri&s;t him&s;elf hath made.

This is the Chri&s;tian's rule, in oppo&s;ition to the receiving or admitting doctrines upon the foot of human authority; in which re&s;pect we are to call no man ma&s;ter upon earth, &s;ince he is our ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t. This will evidently appear,</P>
<P N="1">1. From its being incon&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as head of his church. As &s;uch he hath given us laws, and re&s;erved to him&s;elf a right of judging our behaviour under them. There is one law|giver, who is able to &s;ave or de&s;troy; who art thou that u&s;urpe&s;t this authority, and judge&s;t another?</P>
<P N="2">2. It is de&s;tructive to the nature of religion, as religion ought to be the re&s;ult of &s;uch conceptions as we are able to form of God, and his laws in our minds. An action indeed may look &s;pecious; but if it doth not flow from a real conviction of its excellence, if it be not governed by right motives, it lo&s;es both the nature and reward of a religious action. All the expre&s;&s;ions of our piety, of our reverence, and gra|titude
<PB N="xcviii" REF="97">to God, unle&s;s they &s;pring from an inward &s;en&s;e of our obligation, could &s;ignify nothing in a right e&s;timation. They could not amount to a rea&s;onable &s;ervice, becau&s;e not directed by rea&s;on and under&s;tand|ing: to &s;ubmit blind-fold therefore to the dictates of others, will not con&s;i&s;t with the nature of religion. Under this direction it mu&s;t vary with cu&s;toms and climates, with prevailing factions, and other incidents of life, i. e. will be ju&s;t nothing be&s;ides a fa&s;hionable dre&s;s, and an outward form. Neither can we well expect that a religion taken up in &s;uch a carele&s;s man|ner &s;hould be la&s;ting, when it has no other foundation than that of human authority; it will be liable to be &s;haken by every objection, and to be given up with as little rea&s;on as it was at fir&s;t received: every little dif|ficulty thrown in the way will be apt to bias an indo|lent mind to re&s;ign it, and the apprehen&s;ion of one error &s;hall be taken for a pre&s;umption of more, till an indifference comes on to all religion. This will, I ap|prehend, be the ca&s;e when a profe&s;&s;ion of religion is founded upon any thing but a full conviction of its truth and importance. When we have examined im|partially, and embraced religion upon proper princi|ples, we are mo&s;t likely to remain &s;tedfa&s;t, and hold fa&s;t that which is good.</P>
<P N="3">3. An ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of our under&s;tanding to the &s;en&s;e, which others put upon the words of Chri&s;t, is &s;uch a voluntary neglect of tho&s;e powers and capa|cities, with which we are endowed, as mu&s;t incur &s;ome degree of guilt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to what purpo&s;e have we under&s;tand|ing, rea&s;on, and a capacity of di&s;tingui&s;hing truth from error, unle&s;s it be to direct our choice?

How much &s;oever we may plea&s;e men, by being &s;o ob&s;equious and re&s;igned, &s;urely we cannot plea&s;e God, who will expect us to be and do what he has fitted us for. The account
<PB N="lcix" REF="98">we mu&s;t render at la&s;t to our judge, will be a per|&s;onal one; for every man mu&s;t give an account of him&s;elf to God: there is no plea&s;ing God then by another man's faith and piety, no appearing at our la&s;t tribunal by our deputies, we mu&s;t an&s;wer for our&s;elves, and con&s;equently have a right to direct tho&s;e mea&s;ures we are &s;o &s;trictly accountable for. It is an unalien|able right, re&s;ulting from the very frame of our na|ture and religion. The apo&s;tles, though they enjoyed extraordinary gifts, a&s;&s;umed no &s;uch power over the con&s;ciences of men; they left them to the free exerci&s;es of their own faculties, and commended the Bereans for &s;earching the &s;criptures, to &s;ee what foundation their doctrine had in it

It is an avowed maxim, among&s;t Prote&s;tants e&s;pecially, that a law i&s;|&s;uing from an inferior authority obliges not, when it cla&s;hes with a &s;uperior. This alone can ju&s;tify a &s;epa|ration from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, when it is done upon principles of better information. For &s;ince there is a divine law, importing that every man is to take the be&s;t care he can of his own &s;oul, and mu&s;t give an ac|count of him&s;elf to God; whoever is verily per&s;uaded that he be&s;t an&s;wers this end, by wor&s;hipping God in a Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enting congregation, not only may, but is obliged to follow that cour&s;e, which upon trial he finds mo&s;t for his &s;piritual advantage. Again, this condemns tho&s;e who make the civil law, or the law of the country where they live, the rule of their con|&s;cience in matters of right and wrong; for the thing to be con&s;idered is not what the law of men permit; but what the law of God, natural or revealed, deter|mines in any ca&s;e
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grove's Sy&s;tem, vol. II. p. 112.</NOTE>. So likewi&s;e we find that in law|ful things St. Paul claimed a right to judge of their expediency in re&s;pect to time, or the effect his conduct might have upon others: wherein he declares he would &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the direction and judgment of no man but him&s;elf; all things are lawful but one, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any

<P>Again, an implicit regard to the interpretations and dictates of others is not con&s;i&s;tent with that veneration and e&s;teem we ought to have for the holy &s;criptures. Nothing appears more evident than that they were de&s;igned for common u&s;e and in&s;truction. This par|ticularity appears from their being written in their then vulgar tongue; from their addre&s;s to the com|mon people, and the expre&s;s acknowledgment of the per&s;ons concerned in them. With re&s;pect to the Old Te&s;tament, our Saviour encouraged the reading of them, and imputed the errors of the Sadducees about the re&s;ur|rection to their ignorance of the &s;criptures

<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;. v. 17.</NOTE>: and St. Peter informs us, that his de&s;ign in writing his epi&s;tles was to &s;tir up the minds of Chri&s;tians, by way of remembrance, that they might be mindful of the words which were &s;poken be|fore by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apo&s;tles of the Lord and Saviour
<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">2 Peter, iii. 12.</NOTE>. And it is evident from the epi&s;tles them&s;elves, that they con|tain &s;uch doctrines as are expre&s;sly mentioned in the go&s;pels, or fairly con&s;i&s;tent with them, i. e. &s;uch as we might expect from tho&s;e who were de&s;igned by our Saviour to give a fuller account of his religion. From hence it appears, that the &s;criptures were de&s;ign|ed
<PB N="cii" REF="101">for common u&s;e; and this evidently implies, that God has revealed his will there with &s;ufficient plainne&s;s in all important points, or believe what is more ab&s;urd, that he has given us a revelation that wants another to explain it; and of con&s;equence it mu&s;t be every man's right to have the free u&s;e of the &s;criptures, and a liberty of judging of the true meaning of them, and of receiv|ing the doctrines and principles or Chri&s;tianity from an inward conviction and full per&s;ua&s;ion of their truth, rea&s;onablene&s;s, and excellency, and not received as the effect of chance, cu&s;tom, intere&s;t, implicit faith, or any other motive beneath the dignity of the Chri&s;tian religion

<P>From hence we may rea&s;onably draw &s;ome argu|ments in favour of free and candid debate on matters of inquiry on religion. The great author of nature having given us certain powers and faculties, whereby we are enabled to judge between truth and error, we conceive it is a duty incumbent on us to apply the&s;e po|wers to that generous purpo&s;e for which they were de&s;igned, e&s;pecially as we may rea&s;onably expect that this very inquiry after truth &s;hould be of &s;ome &s;ervice to us, in order to our advancement in virtue, as it has a mo&s;t apparent tendency to promote a &s;pirit of inte|grity and impartiality, and, above all, a &s;pirit of chari|ty. For it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that there is not only a natural inqui&s;itivene&s;s in mankind, but al&s;o a natural &s;anguinene&s;s to &s;upport their re&s;pective tenets; and hence, for want of attending to that common right, which every one has of thinking for him&s;elf, infinite uncharitablene&s;s, har&s;h cen&s;ure, moro&s;e or &s;hy beha|viour, have unhappily prevailed. Now, whatever tends to bani&s;h this narrow and un&s;ocial &s;pirit out of the world, mu&s;t be allowed greatly beneficial to mankind in common. And &s;ince the &s;ame rea&s;ons that prove inquiry rea&s;onable, implies that we ought to u&s;e all the means within our power for information, I am inclined
<PB N="ciii" REF="102">to think every unbia&s;&s;ed reader will admit a free friend|ly debate is one proper expedient for the acqui&s;ition of truth; e&s;pecially as oftentimes it affords an opportu|nity of hearing &s;uch objections advanced by our oppo|nents, as we were not only ignorant of before, but often furni&s;h us with the proper an&s;wer to tho&s;e objections, by another hand, which our then pre&s;ent &s;uperficial in|quiry into that point had not &s;ugge&s;ted to us. A per|&s;on, in his ordinary connections and intercour&s;e with others, will &s;ometimes unhappily fall into the company of per&s;ons, where he may have his faith perhaps de|frauded of its proper &s;upports, by means of &s;ome &s;ub|til reflections, and probably be hardly able to &s;tand the &s;hock; whil&s;t the diligent inquirer after truth, from the advantages he has reaped from conver&s;ation with the judicious, and frequent debate on the &s;ubject of inquiry, will be able to vindicate the cau&s;e of truth, and not only an&s;wer the &s;ubtil objections of his adver|&s;aries, but &s;ilence, and perhaps convince his opponent. This may be illu&s;trated by an application of it to the right of private judgment, the e&s;tabli&s;hing rational religion in the room of &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;ia&s;m, but will be found of equal u&s;e to a&s;certain and enforce the genuine principles and duties of our holy religion again&s;t &s;ceptics and dei&s;ts. This will be farther con&s;i|dered under the advantages of free inquiry
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Watts's Improvement of the Mind, p. 124.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of man is as little able to &s;tand by it&s;elf, or proceed alone through the &s;everal branches of u&s;eful &s;cience, as his per&s;onal &s;trength is to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the violence of every invader: for both the&s;e ends he &s;tands in need of the coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others. The commerce of &s;cience and learning is as naturally advantageous for defence, ornament or im|provement, as any of the common conveniencies of life. Nature &s;eems to point out to us the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a communication of knowledge, by di&s;tributing to different per&s;ons, ta&s;tes and capacities for different
<PB N="civ" REF="103">inquiries and &s;cience, which through the imperfect na|ture of man cannot be compleated at once, owes its progre&s;&s;ion to the&s;e very cau&s;es, that not being obliged continually to renew the labour of invention, we im|prove upon the &s;tock of others, and daily increa&s;e the precious depo&s;it. This is the only patrimony which can de&s;cend from one mind to another; and which, whatever it is that we derive from our ance&s;tors, if we are not unju&s;t or idle managers, we &s;hall tran&s;mit with fre&s;h improvements to po&s;terity. It is likewi&s;e what we impart to others without envy, and grow richer by an exchange of thoughts and conceptions. This com|munication of our &s;entiments with each other's, and freely canva&s;&s;ing the various &s;ubjects of religion, phi|lo&s;ophy and letters, whether by conver&s;ation or writ|ing, I call debate and controver&s;y; and affirm it to be the mo&s;t natural and u&s;eful in&s;trument of knowledge

<HEAD><HI>Here it may be proper fir&s;t to take notice of &s;ome of the principal</HI> ABUSES <HI>of</HI> FREE ENQUIRY.</HEAD>
<P>It is the ob&s;ervation of Dr. Fo&s;ter, that there is not a more valuable ble&s;&s;ing in human life than liberty. Civil liberty is the ba&s;is of all &s;ocial happine&s;s; and liberty of con&s;cience, the only foundation of a rational religion. When the latter is re&s;trained, we are treated rather like brutes than men, i. e. creatures endowed with moral powers, and accountable for actions: and therefore, it is one of the chief excellencies of the Chri|&s;tian religion, and very far from the air and &s;pirit of an impo&s;ture, that it pre&s;erves the rights of con&s;cience &s;acred and inviolable. But, becau&s;e the world is apt to run into extremes, the writers of the New Te&s;ta|ment, like per&s;ons who had a thorough knowledge of human nature, have taken care in this re&s;pect, as well as in all others, to guard again&s;t exce&s;s and irregula|rity. Thus St. Paul advi&s;es the Galatians not to
<PB N="cv" REF="104">mi&s;take licentiou&s;ne&s;s for Chri&s;tian liberty; or in other words, not to imagine, that becau&s;e they were freed from the expen&s;ive and burthen&s;ome ob&s;ervances of the Mo&s;aic in&s;titution, which are elegantly de&s;cribed as a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, they were di&s;charged likewi&s;e from moral obligations, which are an eternal and immut|able law to all rational beings. I &s;hall enquire into &s;ome of the chief abu&s;es of <HI>free-thinking,</HI> by which it happens, that what is really the peculiar <HI>honour</HI> and greate&s;t advantage of our intelligent nature, becomes a reproach to it, and is attended with mo&s;t injurious con&s;equences. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Embracing the principle of liberty, has ended with many in infidelity, or a disbelief of all religion. It is mo&s;t evident, that infidelity never more abounded than in this age of <HI>free inquiry:</HI> and tho&s;e who are mo&s;t loo&s;e in their &s;entiments with re&s;pect to the obligations of religion in general, and of Chri&s;tianity in particu|lar, are, in profe&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t, enemies to bigotry and implicit faith. Nay, it may be allowed further, that it is likely they would never have gone &s;uch a length as to throw off all religion, if they had continued in a blind attachment to the principles of their education, and to e&s;tabli&s;hed and popular opinions. Whence now can this ari&s;e? We who believe, that religion, in all the parts of it, is &s;trictly rational, can never allow that it is the natural con&s;equence of a free and impartial examination of it; but mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, on the contrary, that the more thoroughly it is con&s;idered, and the more nicely weighed in the balance of true and un|bia&s;&s;ed rea&s;on, it will be the more heartily believed and &s;ubmitted to. This melancholy event may however be &s;ufficiently accounted for from other cau&s;es; and that it not only may, but oftentimes does proceed, not from a &s;uperior under&s;tanding, or more adequate and enlarged views of things, but from ignorance, &s;uper|ficial inquiry, and even from that prejudice and impli|cit faith, which the monopolizers of rea&s;on and free|thinking
<PB N="cvi" REF="105">&s;o loudly di&s;claim. I would not be thought, by any thing I am now advancing, to di&s;courage the mo&s;t rational and free examination of all religious prin|ciples, be they ever &s;o &s;acred and venerable, and tran&s;|mitted down with ever &s;o much awe and &s;olemnity by our forefathers; nor would I be thought to a&s;&s;ert, that any man is obliged to receive a revelation, which, upon mature deliberation, appears to be unworthy of God, and repugnant to the rea&s;on and nature of things: for my only de&s;ign is to point out &s;ome fal&s;e principles, which are all an abu&s;e of the true principle of liberty; and by which it is highly probable, many of the pro|fe&s;&s;ed admirers, and zealous e&s;pou&s;ers of it, have been led to a di&s;regard both of revealed and natural religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another abu&s;e of the principle of liberty is this, that &s;ome men &s;eem to think, that becau&s;e they have a right to reject all pretended principles of religion, which are contrary to rea&s;on, to the perfections of the &s;upreme Being, and the eternal laws of piety and vir|tue, they may likewi&s;e throw off the belief of every thing that they cannot fully account for; and are no more obliged, for example, to believe a Providence, becau&s;e the vi&s;ible cour&s;e of things is perplexed and in|tricate, full of di&s;order and &s;eeming inju&s;tice, and not &s;uch as they imagine it would be, if the univer&s;e was governed by an ab&s;olutely wi&s;e and good Being; than they are to receive &s;uch doctrines as a&s;&s;ert that God is a rigorous, &s;evere, and inexorable Sovereign, one that delights in the mi&s;ery of his creatures, and de|&s;troys the nece&s;&s;ary and unalterable di&s;tinction between moral good and evil. This, I &s;ay, is another too com|mon abu&s;e of the principle of liberty, leading to a di&s;|belief even of the fir&s;t principles of natural religion; an abu&s;e that argues great <HI>narrowne&s;s</HI> of mind, and is what per&s;ons of any <HI>compa&s;s</HI> and <HI>freedom</HI> of thought cannot be guilty of

Whether the&s;e men are really in <HI>&s;entiment</HI> again&s;t religion, or whether they di&s;pute only for their <HI>diver&s;ion,</HI> or from a <HI>talkative</HI> humour, or an odd affectation of an uncommon &s;pirit of liberty, I will not take upon me to determine.

<P N="4">4. It is an abu&s;e of liberty to pro&s;titute it to the mean and narrow view of a party-&s;pirit. If the right of judging for our&s;elves was the only concern, why could not men be content to u&s;e it for them&s;elves, and encourage the impartial exerci&s;e of it in others? But to urge it only with a view to procure attention, and thereby gain an opportunity of &s;tarting difficulties, and of recommending a particular &s;et of writers; to urge it on purpo&s;e to un&s;ettle mens principles, di&s;turb &s;o|ciety, or &s;ecure &s;ome private ends, this is to act a low
<PB N="cviii" REF="107">ungenerous part. If any thing honourable was aimed at, why could this not be done without abu&s;e? Is it not perfectly ab&s;urd to contend for the right of judg|ing for our&s;elves, and at the &s;ame time to reproach tho&s;e who u&s;e that right (and happen to differ from us) with weakne&s;s, impartiality, and implicit faith; as if nobody was free, but in a particular way of thinking, and no other evidence could be given of it, but the cavilling at received opinions, and renouncing the principles of Chri&s;tianity; as if every one was en&s;laved by prie&s;ts, who rea&s;oned in favour of the mediatorial &s;cheme, or de&s;erved to be ridiculed, who adhered to his Bible? This is not rea&s;oning, but raving, the true &s;pirit of faction, and the very e&s;&s;ence of bigotry. To contend for liberty in this manner is quite to mi&s;take it, and make the plea for it an introduction only to a new and wor&s;e &s;ervitude
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milner's Religious Liberty a&s;&s;erted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another abu&s;e of the principle of liberty is this, that it has led many who have not proceeded &s;o far as a downright disbelief of all religion, to pay no regard, or at mo&s;t but a &s;light and trifling regard to <HI>in&s;trumental</HI> and po&s;itive duties. But from hence it has been infer|red, that the in&s;trumental duties of piety are not only <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary,</HI> but <HI>hurtful;</HI> and that an inward venera|tion and e&s;teem of the Deity, improved by frequent and &s;erious meditation, is &s;ufficient, without any out|ward &s;tated acts of wor&s;hip, and all that is fit for us to peform, or our Maker to expect: but how does this follow, is it a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion, that becau&s;e &s;uper&s;ti|tion and enthu&s;ia&s;m are mi&s;chievous things, therefore a rational devotion, that is allowed to have no good|ne&s;s in it, but as it is &s;ub&s;ervient to moral purpo&s;es, cannot be helpful to us in pur&s;uit of virtue. By no means: To pre&s;erve a &s;en&s;e of God and his provi|dence in the world, is a de&s;ign that I &s;hould think ought to be approved by all wi&s;e and good men. The giving tho&s;e publick honours to the Deity, has a direct
<PB N="cix" REF="108">tendency this way, and is as really the concern of na|tural as revealed religion: to neglect the&s;e publick te|&s;timonies of our reverence and gratitude, on a pre|tence of liberty, doth not imply an exemption from the obligations of the divine authority and law. We then act freely, in every &s;en&s;e of the word, when we act on the &s;ide of rea&s;on and piety. When we adore the Author of our beings, and a&s;pire in the offices of religion, to a re&s;emblance of his perfect purity and happine&s;s: if this conduct proceeds from an opinion of our &s;uperior knowledge and goodne&s;s, we mu&s;t cer|tainly forget what is the pre&s;ent condition of human nature. The be&s;t furni&s;hed mind, I apprehend, is not &s;o equally attentive in all &s;ea&s;ons, as to want no ad|monition; nor the &s;tronge&s;t virtue &s;o perfect as to be above advice and encouragement. We may therefore infer, that the right of judging for our&s;elves is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the u&s;e of any help or a&s;&s;i&s;tance; nor is in&s;truction impo&s;ition, but a &s;uitable means of im|proving our faculties in the acqui&s;ition of truth.</P>
<P>Again, freedom of thought, and impartial inquiry into the principles of religion, have been abu&s;ed and perverted, in the pre&s;ent age, by degenerating into a light, trifling frame of mind, and a humour of treat|ing &s;acred things with <HI>ridicule.</HI> With people who af|fect this way, liberty is nothing el&s;e but a free, bold manner of treating all &s;ubjects ludicrou&s;ly, and turning them into a je&s;t. They have a great inclination to &s;hew their wit, e&s;pecially upon points that afford the lea&s;t room for it: for this di&s;covers an uncommon genius; and therefore becau&s;e religion is the grave&s;t thing in the world, they re&s;olve to be merry with it; and think it a mo&s;t meritorious action to laugh at what the gene|rality of the world e&s;teem and reverence, and endea|vour to put all the wi&s;e and virtuous part of mankind out of countenan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. But &s;uch empty triflers ought to know, that there can be no true wit which has not rea&s;on for the foundation of it; that ridiculing what is
<PB N="cx" REF="109">in it&s;elf good, u&s;eful and venerable, fixes a certain reproach upon him that attempts it, either upon his under&s;tanding or his morals; that je&s;ting with things of the highe&s;t con&s;equence is folly and madne&s;s; that it is an ea&s;y matter, by mi&s;repre&s;enting, to make any thing appear ridiculous; and con&s;equently, that this talent is &s;o far from being a demon&s;tration that the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it is a wit, as it is from being an evidence of his good-breeding, that, in violation of all the rules of decency, he banters and treats with &s;currility the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of his country, and that which all around him have a high value for.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the greate&s;t abu&s;e of free inquiry, is when it degenerates into licentiou&s;ne&s;s, or is the occa&s;ion of &s;in. Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty, only u&s;e not your liberty for an occa&s;ion to the fle&s;h, Gal. v. ver. 13. The apo&s;tle had a&s;&s;erted the Gentiles right to the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel, without being under any obligation to &s;ubmit to circumci&s;ion. But when he declared their liberty in one point, he would not have them extend it to every other; that becau&s;e they were free from ritual laws, they &s;hould pre&s;ently conclude them|&s;elves free from moral obligations, and under that pretence run them&s;elves into licentiou&s;ne&s;s and immo|rality. No more ought the liberty we claim again&s;t the impo&s;itions of men, weaken our regards for the commandments for God: no notion of liberty &s;hould ever tempt us to break through the obligations of vir|tue, and the re&s;traint of divine fear: no pretence of rea&s;oning for our&s;elves, &s;hould be carried &s;o far as to rea&s;on our&s;elves out of our religion.

Nor can religious truth be at all injured by &s;ubmitting it to a free and open im|partial inquiry

<P>It is a natural con&s;equence of inquiry, that it opens the mind, and prepares it for the impre&s;&s;ions of truth;
<PB N="cxii" REF="111">for it often happens that it di&s;covers the &s;prings and means of right judgment, and produces a conviction of truths, new, intere&s;ting and &s;ublime; he only that &s;eeks and &s;earches after truth &s;incerely, can with any good rea&s;on hope to find it, and that faith which re|&s;ults from inquiry will be the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent and &s;table, as well as the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory and influencing. The &s;criptures always repre&s;ent it as the duty of every rea&s;onable being, even with re&s;pect to points of faith, which are the &s;ubject of divine revelation, the mo&s;t &s;ublime in their nature, and the mo&s;t important as to their end, an employment honourable in the &s;ight of God, and worthy the Chri&s;tian character.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ecret mental plea&s;ure in re&s;earches after truth, and e&s;tabli&s;hing our faith upon a &s;olid founda|tion. This is a &s;anction which God has annexed to his laws, ari&s;ing from the very con&s;titution of his na|ture, &s;o much the more powerful, becau&s;e it is im|mediate and con&s;tant: this thir&s;t after knowledge, like other appetites increa&s;es by being gratified, but with this happy difference, that it increa&s;es by being indulged, and the plea&s;ure it leaves behind, is as grateful as the appetite was eager before.</P>
<P>The field of knowledge is large and &s;pacions; there is room enough for every genius to exert it&s;elf upon objects &s;uitable to its ta&s;te; it helps us to &s;pend our time agreeably, and &s;weetens the cares of life with many plea&s;ing thoughts and reflections; it is the in|crea&s;e of knowledge that feeds the mind with new and agreeable repa&s;ts, and furni&s;hes it with &s;uch infinite variety of plea&s;ing views, that time never &s;eems bur|den&s;ome or tedious; hence it was that Africanus &s;aid, he was never le&s;s alone, than when alone.</P>
<P>The pur&s;uit and acqui&s;ition of truth is a natural and proper means of regulating our pa&s;&s;ions, and of avoiding tho&s;e di&s;compo&s;ures which are too apt to ruffle and perplex the &s;oul; it tends to introduce a calm &s;erenity of mind, which is it&s;elf one of the greate&s;t
<PB N="cxiii" REF="112">enjoyments of life, and gives a grateful reli&s;h and &s;tability to all our other enjoyments.</P>
<P>A man of an exten&s;ive knowledge, the natural re&s;ult of inquiry, is be&s;t qualified to be u&s;eful and beneficent to his fellow creatures, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them under doubts and difficulties, to &s;et them right with regard to points of real importance, and to in&s;pire them with &s;entiments of equity, probity, genero&s;ity, and love of their country.</P>
<P>Again, the plea&s;ures of conver&s;ation, which is one principal means for the acqui&s;ition of knowledge, where it is conducted with freedom, friend&s;hip, ea&s;e, and improvement, is one of the greate&s;t &s;ocial amu&s;e|ments of which human nature is capable; but which ever receive an additional &s;atisfaction, as it partakes of all the&s;e advantages, which &s;eldom fail to unite, where our own abilities qualify us for imbibing the mental &s;atisfactions, and we are &s;o happy as to conver&s;e with tho&s;e who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions and talents form them for communicating their &s;uperior ideas with clearne&s;s and per&s;picuity.</P>
<P>It was a free and candid inquiry that at fir&s;t intro|duced the reformation, and gave it &s;uch remarkable &s;ucce&s;s, progre&s;s, and e&s;tabli&s;hment, freed us from many of the gro&s;s errors and ridiculous ceremonies of the church of Rome; and hence the duty and advan|tages of free inquiry was always recommended by the fir&s;t reformers as the ba&s;is and &s;upport of liberty and truth; judging very rightly, that ignorance can never be the mother of devotion in any religion, which is a rea&s;onable &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Error, &s;uper&s;tition, and bigotry, can never be rooted out but by per&s;uading men to look upon them|&s;elves as rational creatures, and to implant in their minds rational notions of religion. Religion there can be none without a moral difference of things, a moral dif|ference of things there cannot be where there is no place for action, and action there can be none without liberty

<P>It is the opinion of a late philo&s;opher, and I think pretty generally received, that the mind of man is at fir&s;t but a fair unwritten paper, till it has received &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions from without, and improved upon them by its faculties of reflection; and con&s;equently that it is only wi&s;dom and in&s;truction that fills it with fair and excellent characters; that write things upon it in their natural &s;hape and order; that draw them to
<PB N="cxv" REF="116">the life in their true colours and po&s;ture; and de&s;cribe upon it the greate&s;t concerns that are or have been in the world; and, by their means, it becomes a delightful &s;torehou&s;e of the riche&s;t truths and mo&s;t valuable knowledge.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on is the great perfection of human nature; but, like a diamond, it is naturally rough till education po|li&s;hes it, and &s;ets it well; and as nothing is &s;o perfec|tive of our beings, &s;o much worth our care and endea|vours, as a wi&s;e and well-improved mind; &s;o a de|fect of rea&s;on and under&s;tanding is looked upon as one of the greate&s;t blemi&s;hes of human nature. Nay, many had rather you impeach their morals than their wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding; and what is wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, but a mind with true conceptions and lively ideas, &s;tored and enriched with the knowledge of the be&s;t things, the opening it to the noble&s;t truths? in letting it &s;ee and behold all things that God and na|ture hath &s;et around it, and making u&s;eful improve|ment by proper reflections upon them?</P>
<P>Errors may be con&s;idered as more or le&s;s crimi|nal, as they are in a higher or lower degree volun|tary; and all error is voluntary where the cau&s;es of it are voluntary; as, in the fir&s;t place, imperfect and &s;uperficial inquiry, which is evidently unbecoming rea&s;onable creatures, who ought in all points of importance, in which their highe&s;t intere&s;t are con|cerned, to proceed with the utmo&s;t caution, or not to act with ra&s;hne&s;s and pre&s;umption; or, 2dly, Ab|&s;olute indifference and inattention, which directly op|po&s;es the original de&s;ign of our peculiar and more no|ble faculties. But, 3dly, The cau&s;es of religious error may &s;ometimes be pride, prejudice, ob&s;tinacy, or &s;en|&s;ual pa&s;&s;ions, darkening and controuling the judgment, and often bia&s;&s;ing the will to evil.</P>
<P>But this is to be under&s;tood with much re&s;triction and limitation. I am &s;en&s;ible the cau&s;es of error are frequently involuntary. Many are under great di&s;ad|vantages for want of abilities, lei&s;ure, or opportunity,
<PB N="cxvi" REF="117">and other proper and nece&s;&s;ary helps for the acqui&s;i|tion of knowledge; and many, I am well &s;atisfied, have made very con&s;iderable improvements under great di&s;couragements and difficulties, which, where-ever it happens, redounds much to their reputation.</P>
<P>There are a great number of other per&s;ons, who readily acknowledge a fitne&s;s and propriety in being acquainted with religious &s;ubjects; but perhaps they have more darling &s;tudies that engage their thoughts, ingro&s;s their affections, and employ their time. Per|haps the ear has been captivated with mu&s;ic, or the mathematics better &s;uited to their genius; or, they have made choice of &s;ome other learned profe&s;&s;ions, upon which to employ their future &s;tudies: and they have for this rea&s;on bid adieu to whatever is not in their nature &s;ub&s;ervient to them.</P>
<P>I would by no means undervalue other &s;ciences, or &s;peak of them in diminutive terms; but then an in|quiry after truth, and judging for our&s;elves in matters of religion, may certainly throw in its claim, and &s;up|port its right to a part of our time, upon all the prin|ciples of &s;olid rea&s;on, and the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial intere&s;t.

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Improvement of the Mind, p. 30. illu&s;trated by a variety of Rules and Directions, from p. 60 to 211.</NOTE>, five eminent means or methods, whereby the mind is improved in the knowledge of things; and the&s;e are, <HI>ob&s;ervation, read|ing, in&s;truction by lectures, conver&s;ation</HI> and <HI>meditation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;ervation</HI> is the notice that we take of all occur|rences and concerns of human life, whether they are &s;en&s;ible or intellectual, whether relating to per&s;ons or things, to our&s;elves, or others: all things which we &s;ee, which we hear, or feel, which we perceive by &s;en&s;e or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, or which we know in a direct manner, with &s;carce any exerci&s;e of our rea&s;oning pow|ers, may be included under the general name of ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="cxix" REF="120"><HI>Reading</HI> is another and very con&s;iderable means or method of knowledge, whereby we acquaint our&s;elves with what other men have written or publi&s;hed to the world in their writings; by this means we partake of the &s;entiments, rea&s;onings, and improvements of all the learned world, in the mo&s;t remote nations, and in former ages, almo&s;t from the beginning of mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> is another method of improving our minds; wherein, by mutual di&s;cour&s;e and inquiry, we learn the &s;entiments of others, as well as communicate our &s;entiments to them in the &s;ame manner, &s;ome|times between a teacher and learner; but the profit is frequently mutual. Under this head we may al&s;o rank di&s;putes of various kinds.</P>
<P><HI>Public</HI> or <HI>private lectures,</HI> are &s;uch verbal in&s;truc|tions as are given by a teacher, while the learner at|tends in &s;ilence. Thus religion is learnt from the pul|pit-philo&s;ophy, or theology from the profe&s;&s;or's chair, mathematics by a teacher, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Meditation,</HI> or &s;tudy, includes all tho&s;e exerci&s;es of the mind, whereby we render all the former methods u&s;eful for our increa&s;e in true knowledge and wi&s;dom. It is by meditation we come to confirm our memories of things that pa&s;s through our thoughts in the occur|rences of life, in our own experiences, and in the ob|&s;ervations we make. It is by meditation that we draw va|rious inferences, and e&s;tabli&s;h in our minds general prin|ciples of knowledge. It is by meditation that we com|pare the various ideas which we derive from our &s;en&s;es, or from the operations of our &s;ouls, and join them in propo&s;itions. It is by meditation, that we fix in our memory what&s;oever we learn, and form our own judg|ment of the truth or fal&s;hood, the &s;trength or weak|ne&s;s of what others write. It is meditation or &s;tudy that draws out long chains of argument, and &s;earches and finds deep and difficult truths, which before lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ncealed in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>It would be a needle&s;s thing to prove, that our own
<PB N="cxx" REF="121">&s;olitary meditations, together with the few ob&s;ervations that the mo&s;t part of mankind are capable of making, are not &s;ufficient of them&s;elves to lead us to the at|tainment of any con&s;iderable proportion of knowledge, at lea&s;t in an age &s;o much improved as ours is, with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of conver&s;ation and reading, and other proper in&s;tructions that are to be attained in our days; yet each of the&s;e five methods have their pecu|liar advantages, whereby they a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, and contribute to increa&s;e our knowledge.</P>
<P>But it is time to apply the <HI>preceding remarks</HI> to the <HI>&s;ub&s;equent hi&s;tory.</HI></P>
<P>As Prote&s;tants and Di&s;&s;enters from the church of Rome, we are obliged to admit the right of private judgment, in oppo&s;ition to our receiving any thing for true on the credit of the Pope as infallible judge, or (as others of that communion expre&s;s them&s;elves) on the judgment of the Pope, in conjunction with a coun|cil of bi&s;hops; and if this is not admitted, how can we ju&s;tify the conduct of our principal reformers? Did they di&s;&s;ent without inquiring? and, if they made free to examine for them&s;elves, did they not, by ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, a&s;&s;ert the right of every man to do the &s;ame for him&s;elf? And if this be done with care and &s;incere veneration for truth, if we hone&s;tly endeavour to avoid every error, we may be a&s;&s;ured, whatever may be the re&s;ult of our inquiry, we &s;hall not at the bar of God &s;tand chargeable with voluntary ignorance and criminal mi&s;take.</P>
<P>One principal part of our inquiry, as Prote&s;tants, is, how we &s;hall &s;trip Popery of its &s;tronge&s;t bulwark, the pretended infallibility and authority of the church, explode their pretended miracles, and vindicate the principles of Prote&s;tanti&s;m again&s;t all their attempts to blacken and vilify it; vindicate the authority of Scripture as the rule of a Chri&s;tian's faith and wor&s;hip, in oppo&s;ition to tradition; point out their various in|ventions and &s;uper&s;titions in wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline; &s;hew the novelty and ab&s;urdity of many of their cere|monies;
<PB N="cxxi" REF="122">di&s;play the ab&s;urdity of their pretended doc|trines of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, the gro&s;s pre&s;umption of ab&s;olution, and the immoral tendency of indulgences; and, above all, convince them of the repugnancy of per&s;ecution to the &s;pirit and practice of genuine Chri|&s;tianity: and, to do this the more effectually, acquaint your&s;elf with the mo&s;t authentic proofs of their gro&s;s corruptions; the commencement and confirmation of them from the be&s;t hi&s;torians of their church; the de|crees of councils and &s;ynods; and be able to prove the hypothe&s;es you advance by unque&s;tionable authorities: for they will roundly deny, or artfully evade, whatever they are not qualified to vindicate; and de&s;pi&s;e the proofs brought by Prote&s;tants, however well &s;upported. 'Tis, methinks, a laudable acqui&s;ition to be able well to defend and &s;upport the Chri&s;tian religion again&s;t the &s;ubtilty and artifice of tho&s;e enemies of our holy religion; and though I cannot point out in what part of England it is at pre&s;ent prevailing, Ireland abounds with them; and I am well informed, that in &s;ome counties of England their numbers are very con&s;idera|ble, which &s;hould animate Prote&s;tants to be upon their guard again&s;t the delu&s;ive &s;pirit of popery.</P>
<P>A late worthy prelate ob&s;erves
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;timate of the Manners and Principles of the Times.</NOTE>, "That popi&s;h &s;u|per&s;tition is a more active principle, with regard to conque&s;t, than rational prote&s;tanti&s;m. The fir&s;t piques it&s;elf on de&s;troying and extirpating the enemies of God; the latter, regarding none as the enemies of God on account of error, aims only at a rational defence. While prote&s;tanti&s;m therefore retains its proper influ|ence in the minds of men, it may be a match for po|pi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition; what it wants in fury, it makes up in &s;teadine&s;s. This truth our forefathers have twice experienced in our own country." However, he con|cludes, upon the whole of &s;uch arguments, that pro|te&s;tanti&s;m calmly pre&s;ents her&s;elf to the rea&s;on, while popery &s;eizes the pa&s;&s;ions of men; and hence modern
<PB N="cxxii" REF="123">popery, &s;et again&s;t modern prote&s;tanti&s;m, is in danger of overwhelming it.</P>
<P>With regard to our own country, the &s;ame author remarks, that the principles of prote&s;tanti&s;m have lo&s;t their influence or ruling-power; in&s;omuch that it is no inju&s;tice to the higher ranks of this kingdom to &s;ay, that the main &s;ecurity of the church ari&s;eth from its alliance with the &s;tate. There is now among the Great &s;uch a general indifference and &s;upinene&s;s in, not to &s;ay contempt of, every thing that regards religion only, as may well alarm tho&s;e few who look forward to po&s;terity. How different a &s;tate of religion is this from that which prevailed in the reign of Queen Eli|zabeth, when, as Bolingbroke ob&s;erves, the reforma|tion was e&s;tabli&s;hed, not only in the outward form, but in the hearts of men!&mdash;How different from that which prevailed at the grand period of the abdication of James II. when prote&s;tant principles took the lead even of the &s;pirit of civil liberty, and effected the mo&s;t glorious revolution that hi&s;tory hath yet recorded; a revolution that might ju&s;tly be &s;tiled religious rather than political. That great religious &s;pirit, which at tho&s;e illu&s;trious periods &s;hone &s;o bright, is now, as it were, quenched in darkne&s;s!</P>
<P>Popery advances with dreadful &s;trides in America, while prote&s;tanti&s;m lies as it were indolent and inactive; and he a&s;&s;erts, that on the continent of Europe, the Prote&s;tant crowns are divided one again&s;t each other. The popi&s;h crowns unite in open and &s;ecret confederacy. The Empre&s;s Queen has thrown off the ma&s;k, and ba&s;ely de&s;erted tho&s;e who had long and often &s;aved her from de&s;truction. France is pur&s;uing its old game, and fol|lowing its e&s;tabli&s;hed plan of power, and is as tenacious of the popi&s;h doctrines and practices, as is &s;ub&s;ervient to it; and, if Voltaire may be credited, thei&s;m is gene|rally prevailing
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voltaire's Di&s;cour&s;e on Thei&s;m.</NOTE>. Their &s;entiments are di&s;per&s;ed thro' all religions, both abroad and at home, looking on the
<PB N="cxxiii" REF="124">law of nature only as religion, and regarding the ex|ternal form of religion, however it may be agreeable to the pre&s;cribed rules of the Chri&s;tian revelation, as in|&s;ignificant. The manife&s;t inference is this, as it appears that the genius of popery is active, in&s;inuating, fu|rious, permanent, and unalterable; the genius of pro|te&s;tani&s;m, calm, rational, indolent, fluctuating; at the &s;ame time the enemies of Chri&s;tianity are artful, in|&s;inuating, and vigilant, to oppo&s;e its genuine doctrines; Prote&s;tants ought to be more watchful in the pre&s;erva|tion of the invaluable privileges they enjoy, and be active in the &s;upport of them, by endeavouring to &s;upport tho&s;e whom, next to God, are its bulwark and defence. It was ob&s;erved by the late bi&s;hop of Lon|don, in his &s;ermon on the la&s;t rebellion, that we are apt to boa&s;t of the purity of our religion, and our re|formation from the errors and corruptions of the church of Rome, and to flatter our&s;elves we are the peculiar people of God, and &s;et up by providence to be the bulwark of the Prote&s;tant religion. "But re|member &s;till, &s;ays his lord&s;hip, that we are cho&s;en to profe&s;s the truth of God's holy go&s;pel, and to bear our te&s;timony again&s;t the corruptions which have prevailed over great part of the Chri&s;tian world. Let us there|fore &s;et a true value upon the ble&s;&s;ings that are be&s;towed on us, and walk worthy of the light of the go&s;pel, which has &s;hone upon us, that our conduct and beha|viour may bear te&s;timony to the truth we profe&s;s."</P>
<P>Another great point of our inquiry &s;hould be, the defence of the Chri&s;tian religion again&s;t the bold attacks or &s;ecret in&s;inuations of DEISTS; and it is now pretty well known, that their chief &s;trength lies not &s;o much in oppo&s;ing the &s;cripture-doctrine, as tho&s;e mi&s;con|&s;tructions which &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity them|&s;elves have put upon it. And in this point it behoves us to call off unbelievers from their fal&s;e ideas, and give them to under&s;tand the true &s;tate of the contro|ver&s;y between them and us, which is too often over|looked
<PB N="cxxiv" REF="125">by the profe&s;&s;ed writers on that &s;ide of the que&s;tion. And in proof of this I need only refer my reader to <HI>Chri&s;tianity as old as the creation,</HI> and to a later book, called <HI>Chri&s;tianity not founded on argument.</HI></P>
<P>It is a truth that I believe few will deny, however to be regretted (in a land of &s;o much learning, and where the Chri&s;tian religion has been &s;o well defended) that infidelity or dei&s;m has become fa&s;hionable; and this is by no means owing to the cogency of their arguments, but rather to the pains they take in making pro&s;elytes; for which they tru&s;t not to books alone for propaga|tion of their opinions, but that in conver&s;ation they will (and actually do) endeavour to &s;educe others; the &s;uc|ce&s;s of which if po&s;&s;ible &s;hould be prevented by the abilities and a&s;&s;iduity of profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians; and whil&s;t they cavil at revealed religion, it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to put them to the proofs, that mere natural religion contain more e&s;&s;ential, fixed, and permanent principles, and as &s;uch a wi&s;er and better &s;y&s;tem; call upon them likewi&s;e to &s;hew that they have more &s;ub&s;tantial motives to virtue, &s;upported upon better evidence. Many of them at lea&s;t he&s;itate about a future &s;tate; others di&s;card the notion of it, and many of tho&s;e who profe&s;s to believe in a future &s;tate, are in great perplexity and uncertainty about the nature and duration of the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery which will be a&s;&s;igned to the virtuous or the wicked. We may ea&s;ily demon&s;tate to them, that the evidences of the &s;anctions of the Chri&s;tian religion are not &s;o precarious and uncertain; that we have a more &s;ure word of prophecy, whereunto we &s;hall do well if we take heed, as unto a light &s;hining in a dark place, 2 Pet. i. 19.</P>
<P>I have occa&s;ionally mentioned many of our eminent prelates and divines, who&s;e defences of chri&s;tianity have done honour to their names, their country and their religion, and &s;ufficient, a Chri&s;tian would readily imagine, to &s;atisfy every unprejudiced opponent. But if this is not &s;o, &s;omething more becomes our duty; we
<PB N="cxxv" REF="126">are not to give up with indifferency the great articles of our holy religion; but, as far as in us lies, &s;hew our|&s;elves always ready, and always able to confute their &s;tronge&s;t arguments, and explode their ludicrous cavils.</P>
<P>But it would be no difficult matter, if we would give our&s;elves time to deliberate on the natural con&s;e|quences of &s;ome of their tenets, &s;uch as the doctrine of materiality, that God is nature, nature God, &amp;c. to &s;hew that dei&s;m, of which this is one of their fa|vorite &s;entiments, has a direct tendency to &s;ap the foundation of our happy con&s;titution, both in church and &s;tate, and directly repugnant to the e&s;tabli&s;hed and tolerated religion, and municipal laws of this kingdom, and particularly in the teeth of an act of parliament, now in force again&s;t prophanene&s;s and immorality, made not only &s;ince the reformation, but al&s;o &s;ince the re|volution, and toleration of liberty of con&s;cience, by confe&s;&s;edly a number of as wi&s;e men, and great abilities as ever graced a &s;enate.

<P>But be&s;ides tho&s;e peculiar obligations to acquaint our&s;elves with the principal arguments, in defence of the Chri&s;tian religion, again&s;t the objections of modern dei&s;ts, and on every proper occa&s;ion to vindicate the ex|cellency and authority of the Chri&s;tian revelation, the &s;cripture not only requires that every man be fully per&s;uaded in own mind, but that he is able to give an account of the faith that is in him, with meekne&s;s and fear, and rea&s;on coincide with it, as it is not only the ju&s;t foundation of our &s;tability in the Chri&s;tian principles, but a con&s;cious evidence of our having embraced them upon &s;uitable authority.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who make profe&s;&s;ion of the religion e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, ought at all times, not only to be acquainted with the principles of that religion, but at the &s;ame time
<PB N="cxxvi" REF="127">be able to offer &s;omething pertinent, and convincing that they have not undertaken that profe&s;&s;ion in complai|&s;ance to e&s;tabli&s;hed articles only; but from their ap|pearing to be founded on arguments more &s;ub&s;tantial and influencing, &s;uch as to them appear agreeable to the &s;acred &s;criptures, which is allowed the &s;tandard of truth to all prote&s;tants, according to the &s;ixth article of the church of England, and many of the canons of that church. This may be applied to the principal doctrines contained in their articles, di&s;cipline, mode of wor&s;hip, ceremonies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To &s;uch as profe&s;s to differ from the e&s;tabli&s;hed re|ligion, it behoves them in a particular manner to &s;hew the rea&s;onablene&s;s of their &s;eparation, that no fal&s;e bias, no contempt of the authority of the legi&s;lator, a love of &s;ingularity or novelty, but a thorough con|viction that the tenets they profe&s;s are more agreeable to Scripture and rea&s;on; that the wor&s;hip they engage in is more &s;imple, &s;piritual, and edifying; that the di&s;cipline practi&s;ed in tho&s;e churches is more conducive to the purity of faith, the regularity of conduct, and the peace and good order of &s;ociety. If the tenets or prin|ciples of that &s;ociety of which they profe&s;s them&s;elves members, though few in number, are the peculiar characteri&s;tics of that &s;ociety or denomination, it be|comes them more e&s;pecially to be able to &s;hew their &s;ignificance and importance, as having their immediate foundation in the &s;acred writings, and therein declared to be of indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation

<P>WHEN man was &s;unk into ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, and there were &s;carce any re|mains of the uncorrupt religion of nature; when the powers of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy were either not employed, or their efforts proved ineffectual to recover mankind to the knowledge of the one true God, the maker and governor of the univer&s;e, and to give them ju&s;t and worthy notions of his perfections and providence, and the wor&s;hip due to him.

<P>This event came to pa&s;s in the reign of the emperor Augu&s;tus, which, with the con&s;equent fall of heatheni&s;h idolatry, and the conver&s;ion of the Gentiles by the preaching of the go&s;pel, was as amazing a revolution as ever happened in the world, and is with propriety &s;tiled the Chri&s;tian Aera or Epocha.</P>

<NOTE>Nature and de&s;ign of the Chri&s;tian Church.</NOTE> was, that his di&s;ciples being united, and living under the power and influence of his go&s;pel, might be actuated by a friendly and brotherly af|fection, to encourage, &s;upport and comfort each other under every difficulty, and, by a good example, to provoke one another to love and to good works.</P>
<P>Another valuable purpo&s;e intended to be an&s;wered hereby, was, that tho&s;e &s;ocieties might be lights to the world, become public examples of virtue, and thereby recommend the go&s;pel to more general accep|tance.

Mat. vii. 21, 22, 23. <HI>Not every one that &s;aith unto me, Lord!

<P>And that the go&s;pel might be preached to all na|tions, and that the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, might be brought under its influence, and con&s;equently might &s;hare in its benefits,
<NOTE>The apo&s;tles commi&s;&s;ioned.</NOTE> Chri&s;t cho&s;e twelve men, (of which one proved a traitor to him, and to fill up who&s;e place Matthias was cho&s;en) to be with him in his preaching and mini&s;try among the Jews, to be witne&s;&s;es of what he both taught and did, and whom he intended to appoint and qualify to preach the &s;ame go&s;pel to the re&s;t of mankind. And accordingly Chri&s;t, after he was put to death by the Jews and Romans, ro&s;e again from the dead, on purpo&s;e that he might &s;trictly charge and command, and that he might excite and enable the&s;e his apo&s;tles to preach his go&s;pel as afore&s;aid, and thereby pur&s;ue the great end and purpo&s;e of his coming.

Paul and Barnabas, that in the exerci&s;e of their mini&s;try, up and down the world, the&s;e fourteen apo&s;tles might offer to all, without di&s;tinction, the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and by their preaching and example encourage others voluntarily to become Chri&s;tians.</P>

<P>It is evident from the New Te&s;tament, that &s;oon after Chri&s;tianity was promulged by the apo&s;tles, there was a Chri&s;tian church e&s;tabli&s;hed at Rome, a community <HI>called of God to be &s;aints,

<P><PB N="17" REF="146">The general doctrine of the church of Rome is, that Peter was not only appointed by our Saviour the chief of the apo&s;tles; but that he was con&s;tituted the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of Rome, and head of the univer&s;al church, and that after having been &s;even years bi&s;hop of Antioch, he was, in the modern phra&s;e, tran&s;lated to Rome, and continued to be bi&s;hop there twenty-five years, and then &s;uffered martyrdom under the emperor Nero. A. D. 64, according to Blair, 68; according to Whi&s;ton.</P>
<P>But it is not certain which of the apo&s;tles fir&s;t preach|ed the go&s;pel at Rome; &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, that St. Peter came to Rome only occa&s;ionally to vi&s;it that church, and was, by order of the Emperor Nero, crucified with St. Paul, who was charged with having made many pro&s;e|lytes to Chri&s;tianity there.</P>
<P>But that Peter never was bi&s;hop of Rome, is demon|&s;trated by many credible hi&s;torians and divines
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Papi&s;ts indeed &s;ay, that St. Peter was the fir&s;t named an apo&s;tle by Chri&s;t to begin the go&s;pel church, that he wrought the fir&s;t miracle after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion, and preached the fir&s;t &s;ermon, and that this apo&s;tle received the fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ion to begin the Gen|tile Chri&s;tian church, &amp;c. but this is by no means a proof of his being bi&s;hop of Rome. Fir&s;t, from the &s;ilence of St. Luke, who records many things concerning Peter: he write<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his journey to Lydda, Joppa, Cae&s;area, Jeru&s;alem, and Antioch; but not one word of his going to Rome to &s;ound the papal chair.</P>
<P>Secondly, When the apo&s;tle Paul, in his epi&s;tle to the Romans, &s;alutes the Chri&s;tians and his fellow-labourers by name, he &s;ays not one word of Peter; and when even commending the faith of the Church, he never mentions one word of the &s;uppo&s;ed founder of it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, St. Peter him&s;elf &s;peaks not one word of what the Papi&s;ts a&s;&s;ert or alledge in this matter. If he had founded the Roman church, why does he no where mention it? why does he, when writing to the di&s;per&s;ed Jews, no where a&s;&s;ert his claim and preroga|tive?</P>
<P>Fourthly, The a&s;&s;ertion of his being bi&s;hop of Rome twenty-five years, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;acred chronology of tho&s;e times; for from the time of Chri&s;t's death, which was in the 18th year of Ti|berius, to the 13th year of Nero, when Peter was crucified, was only thirty-&s;ix years, viz. five in Tiberius's reign, four in Cali|gula's, fourteen in Claudius's, and thirteen in Nero's. Now Peter did not go out of Judea till twelve years after our Lord's death; then he was ca&s;t into pri&s;on by Herod, Acts, c. xii. which was the fourth year of the Emperor Claudius, and the la&s;t of King Agrippa; &s;ix years after that, or the eighteenth year after Chri&s;t's crucifixion, we find him pre&s;ent at a &s;ynod at Jeru&s;alem, Acts xv. and according to the catholic church, he was &s;even years at Antioch; &s;o there remains only eleven years in which he could po&s;&s;ibly be at Rome, and in|deed there is no evidence of his ever being there in that capacity.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Peter being an apo&s;tle of the circumci&s;ion, Gal. ii. 7, 8. we have rea&s;on to believe, that when Paul was carried to Rome, Peter vi&s;ited the Jews, who were di&s;per&s;ed in Greece, Thracia, the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, Babylon, and the Ea&s;t, and reaped a good harve&s;t among&s;t them, till he went to vi&s;it the church of Rome near the clo&s;e of his life. When therefore the apo&s;tle, 1 Peter, v. 13. &s;ays, <HI>The church that is at Babylon &s;aluteth you,</HI> he plainly writes of Babylon in the ea&s;t, once the head of the A&s;&s;yrian empire, where there was &s;o great a concour&s;e of Jews: and if it be granted that Peter had been at Rome, or re&s;ided there &s;ome time, or &s;uffered martyrdom there, this is no rea&s;on for a&s;&s;erting his primacy or epi&s;copacy in that city more than at Joppa, Antioch, or Babylon.</P></NOTE>, parti|ularly <HI>Budaeus de Eccle&s;.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This book is &s;aid to be compiled by Clement, bi&s;hop of Rome, who was cho&s;en to that office in the year 67, and died in 88: it is entitled Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions, dige&s;ted in eight books; con&s;i&s;ting of 70 canons relating to the laity, and 85 with re&s;pect to the dignity, office, and duty of eccle&s;ia&s;tics: and the late Rev. and learned Mr. Whi&s;ton has, with much pains, endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h their authen|ticity; in which he has likewi&s;e pointed out the order and method of the &s;everal matters therein contained, re&s;pecting doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, and manners; in which is likewi&s;e in&s;erted the canon of &s;cripture, approved and recommended by the apo&s;tles, which were extant before the year 63, together with the Bapti&s;mal Creed, and one other formulary or creed, chiefly calculated to promote the doc|trine of Arius with regard to the &s;ubordination of the Son to the Father.</P>
<P>Then follows an E&s;&s;ay on the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions, wherein our author endeavours to &s;hew their con&s;i&s;tency with the doctrines taught by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles; quotes a variety of te&s;timonies from the fathers and hi&s;torians of &s;everal &s;ucceeding centuries, in proof of &s;ome or other of tho&s;e con&s;titutions, or who&s;e &s;entiments coincided with them.

<P>For be&s;ides the entire &s;ilence of the New Te&s;tament concerning them, which, to me, is no &s;mall proof that they are &s;purious, &s;everal of tho&s;e canons carry with them apparent marks of mere modern in|vention. The dignity and power of the clergy is here, like the hierarchy of the church of Rome, &s;tretched to &s;uch an exorbitant height, as could hardly be con&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tian liberty, or with the &s;afety of Chri&s;tians, e&s;pecially under heathen governors.&mdash;To them was to be committed the care of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenue, for which they were accountable to none but God.&mdash;Moreover, the titles given the prie&s;ts, in &s;ome places, are impious: they are not only &s;tiled prophets, rulers, kings, and governors, but al&s;o mediators between God and his faithful people, and in chap. xxvi. and chap. xxix. &s;tiled gods.&mdash; They mention the u&s;ing holy oil for anointing the candidates be|fore, and of ointments for &s;ealing them after, bapti&s;m&mdash;of u&s;ing water with the wine in the Lord's &s;upper.&mdash;They recommend pecu|niary fines for &s;in, prayers, or offerings and fe&s;tivals for the dead&mdash; e&s;teem and honour for the reliques of &s;aints, and other ceremonies equally &s;uper&s;titious and un&s;criptural: for which me mu&s;t refer the reader to Mr. Whi&s;ton's Primitive Chri&s;tianity Revived, book iii. to which is added his defence.</P>
<P>But &s;o incongruous did the general tenour of them appear to the New Te&s;tament, and &s;o un&s;atisfactory his defence, that they were cen&s;ured by the convocation at Canterbury, A. D. 1711. The form of which is as follows:</P>

<NOTE>Apo&s;tles creed fir&s;t intro|duced.</NOTE> in&s;omuch that the bi&s;hops began to compo&s;e formularies or creeds for their re&s;pective churches, or in oppo&s;ition to &s;ome principal errors; and this &s;eems to be the earlie&s;t period when part of what is called the apo&s;tles creed was introduced
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Having mentioned the apo&s;tles creed, it may be proper to give a general account thereof. The learned author of the Critical Hi&s;|tory of this creed very ju&s;tly acknowledges, that this creed was not the work of one man, or of a day, (he might have &s;aid, nor of one century). The ancient fathers never indeed called it by the name of the apo&s;tles creed, but &s;ay it was agreeable to what they taught. Mo&s;t of the articles are indi&s;putably &s;o; &s;ome of them are &s;aid to be derived from Philip's requiring of the eunuch a profe&s;&s;ion of his faith in Chri&s;t, as the Son of God, as a pre-requi&s;ite to his being baptized: and, for a con&s;iderable time, the chri&s;tian bi&s;hops con|tented them&s;elves with &s;ome &s;uch general form of words, without any particular explication of the nature and action of God, or the &s;tate of the Son. The rea&s;on of the additional articles &s;eems to be this: not long after the apo&s;tles time, &s;everal here&s;ies &s;prung up in the church, &s;ub&s;er&s;ive of the fundamentals of Chri&s;tianity, and even of all religion. Thus the fir&s;t article, <HI>I believe in God the Father,</HI> was introduced in oppo&s;ition to the Manichaeans, who a&s;&s;erted two in|dependent deities, A. D. 276. The word Almighty was al&s;o added to this article, again&s;t &s;ome Manichaeans, who a&s;&s;erted, that the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, were but one per&s;on. The &s;econd article, <HI>and in Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord,</HI> was introduced about the &s;ame time, in oppo&s;ition to Sabelliani&s;m, who made the Son and Holy Spirit to be only virtues or emanations of the deity. The words, <HI>he de&s;cended into hell,</HI> were neither in the Roman nor oriental creeds. The phra&s;e, <HI>communion of &s;aints,</HI> was not in any creed till above 400 years after Chri&s;t, and then not immediately received in all. The clau&s;e of <HI>life everla&s;ting</HI> was omitted in &s;everal; and whoever &s;hall compare the Grecian or the French creed, recorded by Iraeneus, tho&s;e of Carthage cited by Tertullian, that of Aquila, Hippo, Ra|venna, or Turin, will find them all to vary; which, with other con&s;iderations, &s;ufficiently evidence the apo&s;tles could not be the authors of the creed that pa&s;&s;es in their name

<P>From this time the church became modelled by a&s;|&s;uming prie&s;ts; the divines attempted to explain the my&s;teries of religion by the rules of logic, and impo&s;ing articles of faith by authority, rather than convincing by argument.</P>

<P>One of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;teps was the erection of the dignity of patriarch, afterwards con|firmed by the Nicene council; and thus the hierarchy or government of the church became modelled; ac|cording to the con&s;titution of the Roman empire.

<P>The &s;entiments of Arius, commonly called the Arian here&s;y, (which we have before explained) began to prevail. Alexander, bi&s;hop of Alexandria, oppo&s;ed him&s;elf again&s;t him, and &s;ent epi&s;tles to all the churches, and among the re&s;t to Rome; but, without waiting for advice from them, excommunicated Arius. This kindling a great fire, Con&s;tantine was applied to, and the famous council of Nice was a&s;&s;embled by the im|mediate command or precept of Con&s;tantine; and by this and other in&s;tances it appears by who&s;e au|thority councils were convened, at that time, and for &s;ome hundreds of years afterwards, but, if you a&s;k Bellarmine, he &s;ays only by the pope,

<P>When the emperor had brought them to &s;ome tem|per, they fell in good earne&s;t to creed-making, and drew up and &s;ub&s;cribed that which, from the place where they were a&s;&s;embled, was called the Nicene

<PB N="42" REF="177">By the accounts of the tran&s;actions in this a&s;&s;embly, given by Athana&s;ius him&s;elf in his letter to the African bi&s;hops, it appears, that they were determined to in|&s;ert in the creed &s;uch words as were mo&s;t obnoxious to the Arians, and thus to force them to a public &s;e|paration from the church
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Theod. E. H. l.

In this public manner did the bi&s;hops a&s;&s;ert a dominion over the faith and con&s;ciences of others, and a&s;&s;umed a power not only to dictate to them what they &s;hould be|lieve, but even to anathematize and expel from the Chri&s;tian church all who refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to their deci&s;ions, and own their authority; for after they had
<PB N="43" REF="178">carried their creed, they proceeded to excommunicate Arius, and his followers, and bani&s;hed Arius from Alexandria. They al&s;o condemned his book, called Thalia, which contained his explication of his own doctrine. After this they &s;ent letters to Alexandria, and to the brethren in Egypt, Lybia, and Pentapolis, to acquaint them with their decrees; and to inform them, that the holy &s;ynod had condemned the opinions of Arius, and exhort them to rejoice for the good deeds they had done, in cutting off all manner of here&s;y. Con&s;tantine, after this, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the council, (not without &s;ome donations to gratify their avarice) recom|mended to them peace and harmony, and to avoid am|mo&s;ity again&s;t &s;uch as might excel, or be inferior to them: he likewi&s;e wrote to &s;everal churches, recom|mending and enjoining an univer&s;al conformity to the council's decrees, both in doctrine and ceremonies, u&s;ing this, among other arguments, that what they had decreed was the will of God, and that the agreement of &s;o great a number of bi&s;hops was by in&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t. But it is very natural to remark, after the anathemas and depo&s;itions agreed on by this council, which were the beginning of all the per&s;ecutions that afterwards raged, with how little propriety the dignity of in&s;piration was applied to them.</P>
<P>Many unhappy con&s;equences very &s;oon took place; for when the Emperor's recommending to the churches a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their decrees was not effectual, more violent mea&s;ures were made u&s;e of; for out of his great zeal to extingui&s;h here&s;y, he put forth public edicts again&s;t the authors and maintainers of it; again&s;t the Novatians, Valentinians, Marcionites, and others; or|dained that the books written by any of them &s;hould be burnt; and if any kept them in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or en|deavoured to counteract his edict, they &s;hould, on con|viction thereof, &s;uffer death.</P>
<P>Thus the orthodox fir&s;t brought in the puni&s;hment of here&s;y with death, and per&s;uaded the emperor to de&s;troy tho&s;e whom they could not ea&s;ily convert. The
<PB N="44" REF="179">&s;criptures were now no longer the rule and &s;tandard of the Chri&s;tian faith; orthodoxy and here&s;y were from henceforward to be determined by the deci&s;ions of councils and fathers, and religion to be propagated no longer by the apo&s;tolic methods of per&s;ua&s;ion, forbear|ance, and the virtues of an holy life, but by imperial edicts and decrees; and heretical gain&s;ayers not to be convinced, that they may be brought to the acknow|ledgement of the truth and be &s;aved, but to be per&s;e|cuted and de&s;troyed. It is no wonder, that after this there &s;hould be a continual fluctuation of the public faith, ju&s;t as the prevailing parties had the imperial authority to &s;upport them; or that we &s;hould meet with little el&s;e in eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory but violence and cruelties, committed by men, who had left the &s;im|plicity of the Chri&s;tian faith and profe&s;&s;ion, en&s;laved them&s;elves to ambition and avarice, and had before them the en&s;naring views of tomporal grandeur, high preferments, and large revenues.</P>
<P>If one reads the complaints of the orthodox writers again&s;t the Arians, one would think the Arians the mo&s;t execrable &s;et of men that ever lived: but Socrates tells us, this was the practice of the bi&s;hops towards all they depo&s;ed, to accu&s;e and pronounce them im|pious, but not to tell others the rea&s;ons why they ac|cu&s;ed them as &s;uch

<P>Soon after the&s;e tran&s;actions, Arius died; and the manner of his death, as it was reported by the ortho|dox, Athana&s;ius thinks of it&s;elf &s;ufficient, fully to con|demn the Arian here&s;y, and an evident proof that it was hateful to God. The Chri&s;tians, however, being ble&s;&s;ed with Chri&s;tian emperors, were of opinion, that the divine providence had, in a &s;ignal manner, rai&s;ed up and protected Con&s;tantine, for de&s;troying the enemies of the church; but there is u&s;ually much of ra&s;hne&s;s and pre&s;umption, in &s;uppo&s;ing the calamities of finners in this world are particular judgements of
<PB N="45" REF="180">God. Nor did Con&s;tantine him&s;elf long &s;urvive him. He was &s;ucceeded by his three &s;ons, Con&s;tantine, Con|&s;tantius, and Con&s;tans. Con&s;tantine, the elde&s;t, recall|ed Athana&s;ius from bani&s;hment, and re&s;tored him to his bi&s;hopric; upon which account there aro&s;e mo&s;t grievous quarrels and &s;editions, many being killed, and &s;everal publicly whipped, by Athana&s;ius's order, according to the accu&s;ations of his enemies. Con|&s;tantius, after his elder brother's death, convened a &s;ynod at Antioch in Syria, where Athana&s;ius was again depo&s;ed for the&s;e crimes, and Gregory put into the &s;ee of Alexandria. In this council a new creed was drawn up, in which the word <HI>Con&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> was wholely omitted, and the expre&s;&s;ions made u&s;e of &s;o general, as that they might have been equally agreed to by the orthodox and Arians. In the clo&s;e of it &s;everal anathema's were added, and particularly upon all who &s;hould teach, or preach, otherwi&s;e than what this council had received, becau&s;e, as they them&s;elves &s;ay, <HI>They did really believe and follow all things delivered by the holy &s;criptures, both prophets and apo&s;tles.</HI> So that now the whole Chri&s;tian world was under a &s;ynodical cur&s;e, the oppo&s;ite councils having damned one another, and all that differed from them; and if councils, as &s;uch, have any authority to anathematize all who will not &s;ubmit to them, this authority equally belongs to every council; and therefore it was but a natural piece of revenge, that as the council of Nice had &s;ent all the Arians to the devil, the Arians, in their turn, &s;hould take the orthodox along with them for company, and thus repay one anathema with another.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantius II. was warmly on the Arian &s;ide, and favoured the bi&s;hops of that party only, and ejected Paul, the orthodox bi&s;hop, from the &s;ee of Con&s;tanti|nople, as a per&s;on altogether unworthy of it. Mace|donius being &s;ub&s;tituted in his room, who was in a different &s;cheme, or at lea&s;t expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in diffe|rent words, both from the orthodox and Arians, a&s;&s;ert|ing that the Son was not con&s;ub&s;tantial, not of the
<PB N="46" REF="181">&s;ame, but of a like &s;ub&s;tance with the Father, and openly propogated this opinion after he had thru&s;t him|&s;elf into the bi&s;hopric of Paul; this the orthodox party highly re&s;ented, and per&s;ecuted tho&s;e who favoured that opinion.</P>
<P>The truth is, that the Chri&s;tian clergy were now become the chief incendiaries and di&s;turbers of the em|pire; and the pride of the bi&s;hops, and the fury of the people on each &s;ide, were now grown to &s;uch a height, as that there &s;carce ever was an election or re&s;toration of a bi&s;hop in the larger cities, but it was attended with &s;laughter and blood, as it is evident from the accounts given by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;torians of Atha|na&s;ius, Macedonius, and others, that they treated one another with the &s;ame implacable bitterne&s;s and &s;everity as ever their common enemies, the heathens, treated them, as though they thought that per&s;ecution for con&s;cience &s;ake had been the di&s;tingui&s;hing precept of the Chri&s;tian religion

<P>This was the unhappy &s;tate of the church in the reign of Con&s;tantius, which affords us little more than the hi&s;tory of councils and creeds differing from, and contrary to, each other; bi&s;hops depo&s;ing, cen&s;uring, and anathemati&s;ing their adver&s;aries; and the Chri&s;tian people, divided into factions under their re&s;pective leaders, for the &s;ake of words they under&s;tood nothing of the &s;en&s;e of, and &s;triving for victory, even unto blood&s;hed and death.</P>
<P>This occa&s;ioned much debate about the authority of councils and their liability to err in their deci&s;ions. It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that in a council convened by a Chri&s;tian emperor, wherein &s;ome hundreds of prelates are a&s;&s;embled to de&s;ide a theological di&s;pute, many are liable to be influenced by fear or dread of &s;uperiors of greater juri&s;|diction, either of falling under their di&s;plea&s;ure of being reviled as heretics, or perhaps beggared and ruined by their refu&s;ing to be influenced by &s;ome active and do|mineering
<PB N="47" REF="182">&s;pirits; by a deference to the majority; by a love of applau&s;e and re&s;pect; by vanity and ambition; by a total ignorance of the que&s;tion in di&s;pute, or a total indifference about it; by private friend&s;hip; by enmity and re&s;entment; by an indolent di&s;po&s;ition; by an aver&s;ion to di&s;putes, or love of peace and quiet|ne&s;s, &amp;c. which whoever con&s;iders will be ready to con|clude, there is no great deference to be paid to the authority of councils. Even the authority of councils them&s;elves were zealou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted by the council of Con&s;tance and Ba&s;il, and condemned by the Lateran; neverthele&s;s the di&s;pute turned in favour of councils, and it was in general deemed heretical to &s;peak again&s;t their authority. They who di&s;claim private judgement, and believe the infallibility of the church, act con&s;i&s;tent|ly in holding the infallibility of councils; but they who take their faith from the &s;criptures, and not from the church, &s;hould be careful not to require nor to yield too much regard to &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies

<P>We have a rule, by which we may with &s;afety, and with &s;atisfaction, judge of their authority; a rule given us by our Ma&s;ter, <HI>By their fruits ye &s;hall know them.</HI> We need only &s;urvey their acts and monuments, their behaviour, doctrines, decrees, and cen&s;ures, and compare them impartially with the morality, the &s;im|plicity, the prudence, the charity of the go&s;pel; and by this we may judge of the authority of councils and fathers.</P>
<P>The forming of creeds or &s;ummary accounts of the Chri&s;tian faith, till this century, were but few, and tho&s;e conci&s;e, expre&s;&s;ive only of the principal articles, and tho&s;e not impo&s;ed on the churches; but in proce&s;s of time, when the empire became Chri&s;tian, and the deci&s;ions of a&s;&s;embled bi&s;hops were made under the in|fluence of the court, and then enforced by the &s;ecular arm, the creeds they drew up were no longer mere ac|counts of the principal doctrines for pre&s;erving a unity of faith, &amp;c. but obtained the nature of decrees and
<PB N="48" REF="183">laws, henceforth precluding all private judgement, and under one &s;hape or other binding the main body of the clergy, if not the whole Chri&s;tian world. And indeed, what St. Gregory Nazianzen thought of the councils held in his time, that is to &s;ay, in the latter half of the fourth century, appears &s;ufficiently from his letter to Procopius&mdash;that he never &s;aw a good ending of any &s;ynod&mdash;the &s;pirit of contention, or the &s;pirit of ambi|tion, and love of rule, &s;till gaining the a&s;cendancy over rea&s;on: nor does he except that council to which we are &s;o far indebted for the Nicene creed, and at which he him&s;elf, to his &s;orrow, was pre&s;ent.

<P>In the beginning of Julian's reign, A.

He taxed them very heavily, and exacted fines from &s;uch as would not &s;acrifice; and when the governors of the provinces took occa&s;ion, from thence, to increa&s;e the oppre&s;&s;ion, in&s;omuch that per|&s;ons of all ranks could not but complain of their cruelty, Julian an&s;wered, with a &s;neer, Your God hath com|manded you to &s;uffer per&s;ecution. And one of the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for his &s;everity was, that the Chri&s;tian bi&s;hops &s;hewed &s;uch a turbulent &s;pirit, that he was ob|liged to have a jealous eye over them, and bear a &s;trict hand toward them.

<PB N="49" REF="184">upon him to per&s;ecute the Arians. A &s;ynod al&s;o of cer|tain bi&s;hops met at Antioch, who, though they had be|fore oppo&s;ed the Nicene doctrine, finding that Jovian favoured it, with great ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s readily &s;ub|&s;cribed it, and in a very complai&s;ant letter repre&s;ented that this true orthodox faith was the center of unity, while the followers of Macedonius, who rejected the word Con&s;ub&s;tantial, &s;ought to recommend them&s;elves to his favour by the be&s;t repre&s;entation they could give of their tenets.

<P>Marcian, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Theodo&s;ius in the empire, embraced the orthodox party and opinions, and was very de&s;irous to bring about an entire uniformity in the wor&s;hip of God.

D. 454, con&s;i&s;ting of near 600 prelates: the principal cau&s;e of their a&s;&s;embling was the Eutychian here&s;y, viz. That <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of two natures he|fore his incarnation, but that after this he had one nature only: he al&s;o denied that the body of Chri&s;t was of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance with ours.</HI> This council condemned his opi|nions as heretical, and expelled him from the bi&s;hopric of Alexandria, and proceeded to &s;ettle the faith accord|ing to the Nicene creed, the opinions of the fathers, and the doctrine of Athana&s;ius, Cyril, Cele&s;tine, Hila|rius, Ba&s;il, Gregory, and Leo; and decreed that Chri&s;t was truly God and truly man, con&s;ub&s;tantial to the Father as to his deity, and con&s;ub&s;tantial to us as to his humanity; and that it &s;hould not be lawful for any per&s;ons to utter or write, or compo&s;e, or think, or teach, any other faith what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Leo &s;ucceeded Marcian, and zealou&s;ly endeavoured to promote the orthodox faith.&mdash;But, under Zeno, the &s;on-in-law and &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Leo, notwith&s;tanding his uniting and pacifying edict, great differences aro&s;e, and per&s;ecutions were commenced again&s;t the orthodox.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="191">Ana&s;ta&s;ius, who &s;ucceeded Zeno, was him&s;elf a great lover of peace, and endeavoured to promote it both among&s;t the clergy and laity, and therefore ordered that there &s;hould be no innovation in the church what|&s;oever. But this moderation was by no means plea&s;ing to the monks and bi&s;hops: &s;ome of them were great &s;ticklers for the council of Chalcedon, and would not allow a &s;ingle word of their decrees to be altered, nor communicate with tho&s;e who did not receive them: others were &s;o far from &s;ubmitting to this &s;ynod, that they anathematized it; whil&s;t others adhered to the pa|cific edict, and maintained peace with one another, even though they were of different judgement concerning the nature of Chri&s;t. Hence the church was divided into factions, &s;o that the bi&s;hops would not communi|cate with each other: not only the Ea&s;tern bi&s;hops &s;e|parated from the We&s;tern, but tho&s;e of the &s;ame pro|vince had &s;chi&s;ms among them&s;elves.

<P>Very early in this century, the notion of the popes independency on councils was fir&s;t broached: the occa|&s;ion of which was, that &s;ome crimes were laid to the charge of Symmachus, then bi&s;hop of Rome.

One of the council immediately ob&s;erved, they were convened for that purpo&s;e, and he was for that end &s;ummoned to ap|pear before them.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tin, who a&s;cended the imperial throne, A. D. 518, revived the per&s;ecutions, as a mark of his greater zeal for orthodoxy than his predece&s;&s;or: Ana&s;ta&s;ius Severus, bi&s;hop of Antioch, being warm again&s;t the council of Chalcedon, the emperor ordered his tongue to be cut out.

Hormi&s;da al&s;o, bi&s;hop of Rome, after the example of Symmachus, bani&s;hed the remainder of the Manichees, and cau&s;ed their writings to be burnt.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tinian, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;ucceeded him al&s;o in his zeal for the council of Chalcedon, and bani&s;hed the bi&s;hops of Con&s;tantinople and Antioch, becau&s;e they would not obey his orders.&mdash;He publi&s;hed a law, that there &s;hould
<PB N="60" REF="195">be no pagan or heretic in his empire, allowing three months only for their conver&s;ion: by another, he ren|dered them incapable of being witne&s;&s;es in any trial again&s;t Chri&s;tians: he likewi&s;e prohibited the tran|&s;cribing any heretical book, upon the puni&s;hment of lo&s;ing both their hands. The&s;e laws were principally enacted at the in&s;tigation of the orthodox bi&s;hops. Thus Agapetus, bi&s;hop of Rome, who had condemned An|thimus, and depo&s;ed him from his &s;ee of Con&s;tantinople, per&s;uaded Ju&s;tinian to bani&s;h all tho&s;e whom he had con|demned for here&s;y.

<P>During the reign of Ju&s;tinian, in the 24th year of it, was held the fifth general council at Con&s;tantinople, A. D. 553, con&s;i&s;ting of about 165 fathers. The occa|&s;ion of their meeting was the oppo&s;ition that was made to the four former general councils, and particularly the writings of Origen, which Eu&s;tochius, bi&s;hop of Jeru|&s;alem, accu&s;ed, as full of many dangerous errors. In the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions it was debated, whether <HI>tho&s;e, who were dead, were to be anathematized?</HI> One Eutychius looked with contempt on the fathers for their he&s;itation in &s;o plain a matter, and told them, that there needed no deliberation about it; for that king Jo&s;ias formerly did not only de&s;troy the idolatrous prie&s;ts who were living, but dug al&s;o tho&s;e, who had been dead long before, out of their graves. So clear a determination of the point, who could re&s;i&s;t? The fathers were immediately con|vinced, and Ju&s;tinian cau&s;ed him to be con&s;ecrated bi&s;hop of Con&s;tantinople, in the room of Menas, ju&s;t de|cea&s;ed, for this his &s;kill in &s;cripture and ca&s;ui&s;try. The con&s;equence was, that the decrees of the four preceding
<PB N="61" REF="196">councils were all confirmed; tho&s;e who were condemned by them, re-condemned and anathematized; particu|larly Theodorus, bi&s;hop of Mop&s;ue&s;tia, and Ibas, with their writings, as favouring the impieties of Ne&s;torius; and finally, Origen, with all his dete&s;table and execrable principles, and all per&s;ons what&s;oever, who &s;hould think or &s;peak of them, or dare to defend them. After the&s;e tran&s;actions the &s;ynod &s;ent an account of them to Ju&s;ti|nian, whom they complimented with the title of <HI>the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and with having a &s;oul partaker of the heavenly nobility;</HI> and yet &s;oon after the&s;e flatteries, his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty turned heretick him&s;elf, and endeavoured, with as much zeal, to propagate here&s;y, as he had done orthodoxy before: he publi&s;hed an edict, by which he ordained, That <HI>the body of Chri&s;t was in|corruptible, and incapable even of natural and innocent pa&s;|&s;ions; that before his death he eat in the &s;ame manner as he did after his re&s;urrection, receiving no conver&s;ion or change from his very formation in the womb, neither in his volun|tary or natural affections, nor after his re&s;urrection.</HI> But as he was endeavouring to force the bi&s;hops to receive his creed, God was plea&s;ed, as Evagrius ob&s;erves, to cut him off.</P>
<P>But after the year 560, the bi&s;hops being become the ab&s;olute di&s;pen&s;ers of the fourth part of the goods of the church, they began to employ more of their care in their temporal affairs, and to make parties in the cities; &s;o that elections were no longer carried on with a view to the &s;ervice of God, but managed by faction and in|trigues, which often proceeded to open violence.

The&s;e proceedings produced an edict, that no per&s;on elected &s;hould be con&s;ecrated without the approbation of the prince, re&s;erving to them&s;elves the right of confirming the great bi&s;hoprics, &s;uch as tho&s;e in Italy, of Rome, Ravenna, and Milan. In this manner, that is, with the imperial &s;anction, the popes and bi&s;hops continued to be cho&s;en. Through all the hi&s;tory of Gregory of Tours, from the time of Clowis, the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian king of France, until the year 590, we find no in&s;tance of any one bi&s;hop being made in any other manner, than by the nomination or con&s;ent of the king. It was ea&s;y for tho&s;e bi&s;hops, when once they were made without the authority of the people, to exclude the people al&s;o from the choice of prie&s;ts and deacons, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical mini&s;ters, and to transfer that right to the emperor or prince alone: and thus the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hops and clergy became greatly irregu|lar; and, in&s;tead of being cho&s;en and &s;et apart to their re&s;pective offices by the people, whom they were ap|pointed to watch over and mini&s;ter unto, accord|ing to rea&s;on and ancient u&s;age, they were &s;et apart by tho&s;e inve&s;ted with civil power.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding this order and method was broke through in after-times by arbitrary mea&s;ures, it appears that, &s;o late as the year 590, the pope was not deemed lawful pope till his election was confirmed by the emperor: hence Gregory the Great, being cho&s;en by a great majority, but de&s;irous to decline that dig|nity, wrote to the emperor Mauritius, intreating him to refu&s;e his con&s;ent, that the electors might thereby be obliged to chu&s;e another. The per&s;on cho&s;en was al&s;o &s;tiled Elect, not Bi&s;hop, and yielded the fir&s;t place in the church to the arch prie&s;t

<P>Under Mauritius, John, bi&s;hop of Con&s;tantinople, in a council held in that city, &s;tiled him&s;elf Oecumenical Bi&s;hop, by the con&s;ent of the fathers there a&s;&s;embled;
<PB N="63" REF="198">and the emperor him&s;elf ordered Gregory to acknow|ledge him in that character. Gregory ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed it, and replied, that the power of binding and loo&s;ing was delivered to Peter and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and not to the bi&s;hops of Con&s;tantinople; admoni&s;hing him to take care, that he did not provoke the anger of God again&s;t him&s;elf, by rai&s;ing tumults in his church. This pope was the fir&s;t who &s;tiled him&s;elf, <HI>Servus Servorum Dei,</HI> Servant of the Servants of God; and had &s;uch an abhorrence of the title of Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop, that he &s;aid, "I confidently affirm, than who&s;oever calls him&s;elf Univer&s;al Prie&s;t, is the fore-runner of Antichri&s;t, by thus proudly exalting him&s;elf above others."</P>
<P>But however mode&s;t Gregory was in refu&s;ing and condemning this arrogant title, Boniface III. thought better of the matter; and, after great &s;truggles, pre|vailed with Phocas, who murdered Mauritius, the em|peror, to declare, that the &s;ee of the ble&s;&s;ed apo&s;tle Peter, which is the head of all churches, &s;hould be &s;o called and accounted by all, and the bi&s;hop of it Oecumenical or Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop. The church of Con&s;tantinople had claimed this precedence and dignity, and was &s;ometimes favoured herein by the emperors, who declared, that the fir&s;t &s;ee ought to be in that place which was the head of the empire. The Roman pontiffs, on the other hand, affirmed that Rome, of which Con&s;tantinople was but a colony, ought to be e&s;teemed the head of the empire; becau&s;e the Greeks them&s;elves, in their writings, &s;tile the emperor, Roman Emperor, and the inhabitants of Con&s;tantinople are called Romans, and not Greeks; not to mention that Peter, the prince of the apo&s;tles, gave the keys of the kingdom of heaven to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the popes of Rome. On this foundation was the &s;uperiority of the church of Rome, to that of all other churches, built: and Phocas, who was guilty of all villainies, was one of the fitte&s;t per&s;ons that could be found to gratify Boniface in this reque&s;t. Boniface al&s;o called a council
<PB N="64" REF="199">at Rome, where this &s;upremacy was confirmed, and by whom it was decreed, that bi&s;hops &s;hould be cho&s;en by the clergy and people, approved by the prince of the city, and ratified by the pope with the&s;e words, <HI>volumus et jubemus,</HI> for this is our will and command.

<HEAD>CENTURY THE SEVENTH.</HEAD>
<P>In this century we meet with many remarkable oc|currences.&mdash;At the beginning of it, Mellitus, the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of London, in con&s;equence of the high dignity to which he was advanced, went to Rome, as Bede in|forms us, to con&s;ult with the pope concerning the affairs of the Engli&s;h church; on which occa&s;ion Boniface called a council of the Italian bi&s;hops, at which the bi&s;hop of London attended or a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and when it broke up, returned to London with the decrees of that court.</P>
<P>Pope Boniface &s;hewed no &s;mall zeal in propagating the Chri&s;tian religion in Great Britain; but, at the &s;ame time, he took care to introduce an undue veneration for the papal robes, for the authority and dignity of the &s;overeign pontiff, and for a variety of ceremonies which defaced the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel. This pope's pall was fir&s;t &s;ent into England to Ju&s;tus, who, in the year 624, &s;ucceeded Mellitus in the &s;ee of Canterbury; and the number of bi&s;hops were greatly increa&s;ed, as well as of inferior clergy, who received their ordination from the bi&s;hop of Canterbury, by virtue of that great dig|nity which had been delegated to him by the pope.</P>
<P>Another point aimed at was, to increa&s;e a veneration for the clergy, in&s;omuch that pretty early in this cen|tury
<PB N="67" REF="202">the clergy acquired a very great a&s;cendancy over the people, and they voluntarily imparted a con&s;iderable &s;hare of their worldly &s;ub&s;tance, e&s;pecially in &s;ome of the capital cities, as well as Rome, which in each city made one capital &s;tock; and this was not divided be|tween them and the poor, but was appropriated to the prie&s;t, and other collections were made for the poor: the&s;e capital &s;tocks were called Patrimonies; a name not denoting any dominion or juri&s;diction belonging to the Roman church, or the pope, but to &s;ignify the e&s;tate of every church, and was di&s;tingui&s;hed from the patri|monies of private men, as we find in many places of the 12th book of the Code
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul of Beneficiary Matters, p.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And to create a greater re&s;pect for the e&s;tates be|longing to the church, it was u&s;ual to annex the name of &s;ome favourite &s;aint which that church held in great veneration; &s;o the e&s;tates of the church of Ravenna were called the patrimony of St. Apollinare; that of Milan, the patrimony of St. Ambro&s;e; and the e&s;tates of the Roman church, the patrimony of St. Peter in Am|bruzzo.</P>
<P>The bulk of eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;torians fix the year 606 for the title of univer&s;al bi&s;hop, being conferred by way of pre-eminence on the pontiff of Rome; a dignity which had been a&s;&s;umed by the bi&s;hop of Con&s;tantino|ple, and by others in the la&s;t century, but was now confirmed to pope Boniface III. who, being elected pope, prevailed on the emperor Phocas to take the title of univer&s;al bi&s;hop from the bi&s;hop of Con&s;tanti|nople, and to grant it to him, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, by his ab&s;olute decree, which pa&s;&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. His taking upon him this authority, or dignity, was thought the more extraordinary, as his immediate predece&s;&s;or but one, and probably, the be&s;t and the greate&s;t, &s;o often condemned it in any bi&s;hop what&s;oever, and rejected it with indignation, when offered to him&s;elf, as vain, proud, impious, bla&s;phemous and antichri&s;tian, But

<P>The church of Scotland were much divided in their &s;entiments concerning the time of keeping Ea&s;ter, and were with much difficulty reduced to the celebration of it according to the practice of the church of Rome.</P>
<P>About the year 634 commenced that grand di&s;pute, which made &s;o much noi&s;e in the Ea&s;t, whether there were in Chri&s;t two operating wills, the one human, the other divine, or only one will and one operation: this occa&s;ioned a general di&s;&s;ention, and the convention of &s;everal councils, and in the fifth and la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lateran, A. D. 637, under the more immediate di|rection of pope Honorius, it was concluded in favour of one will. But this did not terminate the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>However, about the year 646 another di&s;pute in|tervened in regard to the titles and authority of the pope, the African bi&s;hop having addre&s;&s;ed Theodore the pope in a very high &s;tile, calling him father of fa|thers and the &s;upreme pontiff of all bi&s;hops: the new primate of Con&s;tantinople wrote to him as his brother, and concluded with &s;aying, the apo&s;tles had all an equal &s;hare of power and of honour. This di&s;pute &s;ub&s;ided for a time, and gave place to the revival of the former.</P>
<P>In 649 a council was called by Martin, bi&s;hop of Rome, concerning the two natures and two opera|tions in Chri&s;t, and the doctrine of one will and one operation condemned and anathematized
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. iii. p. 49.</NOTE>. The form as follows: &mdash; "I Martin, by the mercy of God, bi&s;hop of the holy catholic and apo&s;tolic church of the city of Rome, have &s;igned as judge this definition, con|firming

<P>This authoritative definition and decree gave great umbrage, and did not &s;oon &s;ub&s;ide; for it appears, that the authority of the pope, &s;o late as the year 669, was a matter of di&s;pute: it was not acknowledged in Italy it&s;elf without the limits of the Suburbicarian provinces, the ancient limits of the juri&s;diction of the bi&s;hop of Rome. Maurus, bi&s;hop of Ravenna, being &s;oon after &s;ummoned by Vitalianus, to Rome, to give an account of his faith and his conduct, not only refu&s;ed to obey the &s;ummons, but let the pope know, that he had no authority over him or his &s;ee.

<P>Such was the conduct and conclu&s;ion of the &s;ixth ge|neral council, declared to be of equal authority with the council of Nice, or any other council, and their de|crees; according to pope Gregory the Great, equal with the go&s;pels them&s;elves; but by this council the infalli|bility of the pope is irreconcilable with that of the council, Honorius the pope being thereby condemned as a heretic, his books ordered to be burnt, and he over and over anathematized.

The means made u&s;e of for this purpo&s;e, and the principal cau&s;es of it, were the &s;uper&s;titious veneration for the pretended chair of St. Peter; &mdash; the divi&s;ions among&s;t the clergy, which pro|duced the cu&s;tom of appealing to the popes &mdash; the obli|gation laid on the mi&s;&s;ionaries employed for preaching the go&s;pel among the pagans, to in&s;truct them in the authority and dignity of the pope&mdash;their zeal likewi&s;e in a&s;&s;erting and vindicating his pre-eminence to tho&s;e of all other eccle|&s;ia&s;tics, which was confirmed by grant of privileges, and particularly by &s;ending the pallium&mdash;the fanta&s;tical de&s;ire of &s;ome prelates to be con&s;ecrated by the pope him&s;elf &mdash; the &s;eparation from the ea&s;tern churches, which was always decried as heretical&mdash;the &s;trict care taken to attach the body of the monks to the &s;ervice of the &s;ee of Rome&mdash;the collections of the papal decretals, and of the canon laws of Rome, &amp;c. were compiled for the direction of churches in general.</P>

<P>Neverthele&s;s, in this century, the bi&s;hops of Rome became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of territories and &s;ubjects, which at fir&s;t proceeded from the princes and kings of France of the Carlovingeian line, who, in a great mea&s;ure owing their promotion to the friend&s;hip of the pope, in the warmth of their gratitude, be&s;towed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Italy on the &s;ee of Rome: but, then, they conveyed to the pope no more than an u&s;ufructuary enjoyment of certain territories, &s;till retaining the &s;overeignty.

<P>However, we may, in the la&s;t place, mention that, about the clo&s;e of this century, the ki&s;&s;ing of the foot of the pope took place, as a token of re&s;pect, which had before been paid to the high prie&s;t among the pagans.</P>

<P>Popes were then excommunicated by their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and their acts cancelled and annulled, not excepting the very admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments. Six popes were driven out, and dethroned, by tho&s;e who a&s;pired to their places.</P>

<P>Nor is there any century in which the Roman chair was di&s;graced by &s;o many profligate popes as in this.

<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Dupin's Preface to the twelfth Century, folio edit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In England, where the king had hitherto conferred the bi&s;hopricks and abbies, An&s;elm, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in the year 1102, in obedience to the pope's decrees, began to refu&s;e to con&s;ecrate bi&s;hops nominated by the king. This conte&s;t held for many years, the king, viz. Henry I. maintaining his right, and the archbi&s;hop, &s;upported by the pope, oppo&s;ing it: the king, in hopes to bring the pope to hear rea&s;on, &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador to Rome, who, provoked by the rough an|&s;wers and menaces of the pope, declared, that his ma&s;ter would never yield up his authority, though he lo&s;t his kingdom in its defence; to which the pope, with no le&s;s boldne&s;s, replied, he would never &s;uffer the king to nominate to the benefices if he lo&s;t his head. The king, on the amba&s;&s;ador's return, exerted his au|thority; and An&s;elm, the archbi&s;hop, was obliged to quit the kingdom; nor could he return without
<PB N="86" REF="221">complying with the king's plea&s;ure.&mdash;But this prince dying, and a civil war en&s;uing, it was ea&s;y for the clergy to introduce into England what the pope had done in his empire.</P>
<P>In that &s;pace of time, between the years 1122, where|in Henry renounced the inve&s;titure by the pope, and 1145, it became a rule almo&s;t every where in Germany, that, upon the death of a bi&s;hop, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould be cho&s;en by the chapter, and confirmed by the metro|politan; that the abbots &s;hould be cho&s;en by the monks, and then confirmed by the bi&s;hop, if the mona&s;tery were not exempted and if it were, then the pope was to be applied to for his confirmation; that the other benefices, which were <HI>de jure patronatus,</HI> &s;hould be conferred by the bi&s;hops upon the pre&s;entation of the patron; and that all the re&s;t &s;hould be at the entire di&s;po&s;al of the bi&s;hop. &mdash; Neverthele&s;s, the election of the popedom came under no new regulation
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul of Beneficiary Matters, p. 106.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>However, the emperor held a right with re&s;pect to &s;ome churches; and the pope, unwilling to revive the old quarrel, as it were, &s;hared &s;nacks with him under various pretences.</P>
<P>France, however, retained the royal prerogative (call|ed the Regale) of conferring all &s;imple benefices vacant upon the bi&s;hops death, until a &s;ucce&s;&s;or was appointed. &mdash; But near the clo&s;e of the next century we find Boni|face VIII. had a &s;harp conte&s;t with Philip of France, and ruined the kingdom, in great mea&s;ure, by the ex|communications, interdicts, &amp;c. and, at length, de|prived the king of his throne, and for &s;ome time gave it to the emperor Albert, depriving tho&s;e of their be|nefices, who held them under the king
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ab&s;tract from Father Paul of Beneficiary Matters, ibid.</NOTE>. This proved one con&s;iderable means of enlarging the power of the pope.</P>
<P>Another con&s;iderable means of increa&s;ing the papal power was the bu&s;ine&s;s of tythes, fir&s;t fruits, &amp;c. which
<PB N="87" REF="222">was made to extend to fi&s;heries, hay, wool, bees, &amp;c. which were exacted under the &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ures. &mdash; And in order the better to promote their wealth and power, they revoked a law that had been made, that the church &s;hould reject the donations and legacies of pub|lic &s;inners; but this ob&s;tacle was removed, and the pope and clergy endeavoured to prove tho&s;e donations a kind of extenuations where they could not be pro|nounced meritorious.</P>
<P>The large opportunities which the court of Rome had in their hands, of obliging by the di&s;po&s;al of &s;o many benefices, drew thither a concour&s;e of the clergy of all &s;orts; of tho&s;e who had no beneficies, to obtain them; and tho&s;e who had, to get them exchanged for better: and this occa&s;ioned frequent ab&s;ence, they were obliged to purcha&s;e indulgence or ab&s;ence of leave from their cures. &mdash; Commendams was al&s;o another pretty device: when an elective benefice became vacant &s;uch as a bi&s;hopric abby, &mdash; the care of it was recommend|ed by the &s;uperior to &s;ome per&s;on of merit, or of inte|re&s;t, till another was cho&s;e: afterwards it was given for a certain time

<P>But among other mea&s;ures that contributed to render the pope &s;upreme governor of all Chri&s;tendom, and to center the riches of the world in the trea&s;ury of the church, were the cru&s;ades or martial expeditions again&s;t infidels, e&s;pecially as the clergy were fond of preaching again&s;t heretics, as they called them and their protectors. "This device," &s;ays Mezeray, "was a very &s;ucce&s;sful means to aggrandize the pope; for they ordered princes to enroll them&s;elves in tho&s;e expeditions; they retained the &s;overeign command of tho&s;e armies by their legates; and they became, in &s;ome &s;ort, lords in chief of all who went to the cru&s;ade, not only becau&s;e the pope exacted obedience from them, but becau&s;e they took the other under their protection till their return, which

<P>But the greate&s;t &s;upport of all this u&s;urpation was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the inqui&s;ition in Italy, and the con|firmation of Gratian's collection of canon laws. &mdash; Add to this the practice of canonization as an excellent means to &s;ecure con&s;tancy in the faith of the Romi&s;h church; to enrich the papal trea&s;ury; and to extend that power not only to the di&s;po&s;al of temporal crowns and king|doms, but even of cele&s;tial crowns too, when it was &s;ub&s;ervient to their ambition or intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Pope Cele&s;tine III. was a remarkable in&s;tance of this boundle&s;s ambition, who having been formerly ob|liged by Henry with &s;everal favours, was more inclina|ble to crown him, in order to which the young empe|ror ha&s;tened to Rome with his empre&s;s, and they were both crowned by this holy father in an unprecidented and mo&s;t remarkable manner.

<P>Father Paul gives us a compendium of the&s;e mat|ters: he &s;ays, "By various methods the popes drew to them&s;elves a great part of the collation of benefices in all the Chri&s;tian kingdoms in the we&s;t; but, in the ea&s;tern churches, they were not allowed to di&s;po&s;e of one benefice. In Italy, indeed, they met with &s;uch great &s;ucce&s;s, that they flattered them&s;elves they &s;hould impo&s;e on all Europe.</P>
<P>In England, where the benefices are very rich, the Roman courtiers made &s;uch mighty acqui&s;itions, that,
<PB N="91" REF="226">in the year 1232, the clergy and military men of the kingdom formed a confederacy or a&s;&s;ociation, and pil|laged all the goods and revenues of the beneficed Ro|man clergy throughout the i&s;land. The pope com|manded the king, under pain of excommunication, to cha&s;ti&s;e them with his temporal arms, and the bi&s;hops to excommunicate them; but the confederacy was too &s;trong, either for the king to puni&s;h, or the bi&s;hops to excommunicate them.</P>
<P>Pope Innocent IV. &s;omewhat incen&s;ed at it, &s;ent one Martin, a kin&s;man of his, to renew the preten&s;ions of the court of Rome. The Engli&s;h complained to the king, that the Italians had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the be|nefices, and the king drove Martin out of the king|dom; and, making a computation of the revenues, which the pope drew out of the kingdom, found that they were equal to his own revenues, which amounted to 60,000 marks: and, upon his laying the&s;e griev|ances before the pope, in the council of Lyons, where he pre&s;ided, he was an&s;wered, that the council was not a&s;&s;embled for that affair, nor was that the &s;ea&s;on to remedy it.

<P>Neverthele&s;s, the court cea&s;ed not to make new at|tempts in the year 1253, requiring the bi&s;hop of Lin|coln to confer a benefice upon a Genoe&s;e; which he rejected, at it was again&s;t the canons of the church: but he was neverthele&s;s excommunicated by the pope.

Among others, the popes authority being founded upon this belief, that St. Peter had been at Rome, and by his pre&s;ence had communicated a particular prerogative and holine&s;s to that chair, it was very much que&s;tioned whether the &s;ame could be transferred to Avignon

<P>Boniface IX. was the fir&s;t who exacted annates, i. e. one year's revenue of every bi&s;hopric and abby, at each in&s;tallment

Be it known to your great extravagance, that we are not &s;ubject to any per&s;on what&s;oever as to what regards temporals; that the collation of churches and prebend&s;hips belongs to us by a royal right, and that we have a power to appropriate the fruits of it to our&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>After the popes had a&s;&s;umed great part of the power to them&s;elves, of which they had &s;tripped the emperor, John XXII. in the year 1316, made a decree,
<PB N="64" REF="231">that for three years, whoever obtained a benefice of more that twenty-four ducats of yearly rent, &s;hould pay one year's value, for the expedition of his bull.</P>
<P>Some few years after the in&s;titution, or re&s;ervation of annates, king Edward, in the year 1373, &s;ent an am|ba&s;&s;ador to pope Gregory XI. then at Avignon, to pre&s;s him to annul the re&s;ervations entirely, which, after it had been in agitation, were the next year totally abo|li&s;hed by this pope.</P>
<P>But a great &s;chi&s;m ari&s;ing in the church upon his death, which happened in the year 1378, and produced two popes, and confequently two courts, the nece&s;|&s;ary expences to &s;upport them were al&s;o doubled. Thus all inventions for fleecing the people were &s;et on work with fre&s;h vigour. Simony appeared no where &s;o bare|faced, the two courts holding an open market for benefices; and every e&s;&s;ay was made that was po&s;&s;ible to &s;trip the ordinary collators of the right of pre|&s;enting.</P>
<P>Hitherto the court of Rome had not taken off the ma&s;k, nor had &s;o avowedly owned that pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had for money; but pope Urban VI. left it no longer to conjecture, why he concerned him&s;elf with the collation of benefices, when he declared, that no pre&s;entation &s;hould be good, where the value was not expre&s;&s;ed
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By the&s;e methods the apo&s;tolic chamber came to a ju&s;ter knowledge of the value of the annates. This was thought by &s;ome to be no better than putting up the benefices to auction: but on the other hand, it was in&s;inuated, that it was only to prevent the holy chamber being defrauded of their right.</P>
<P>No body can deny, but that the di&s;orders were no|torious in the Roman courts on this occa&s;ion; and that many neighbouring kingdoms were &s;o greatly alarmed and di&s;gu&s;ted at the variety of tricks and &s;hifts they &s;aw practi&s;ed, that they came at la&s;t to acknowledge neither of the competitors for pope.

<P>The&s;e confu&s;ions received a con&s;iderable increa&s;e by the addition of a third pope, which, with the king of France's mea&s;ures, will be related in the hi&s;tory of the next century.</P>

<HEAD>CENTURY THE FIFTEENTH.</HEAD>
<P>The Fifteenth Century of the church is full of great tran&s;actions: the &s;chi&s;m of the popes, which appeared at the beginning of it, was, for many years, the great care and bu&s;ine&s;s of the prelates and Chri&s;tian princes of the we&s;t; be&s;ides this, the difference between the council of Ba&s;il and pope Eugenius IV. and the project of the re-union of the Greeks to the Latin church, were the great concerns of Chri&s;tendom: but the former had not tho&s;e mi&s;chievous con&s;equences which were feared, nor the latter the &s;ucce&s;s which was hoped for. Among many other remarkable events, the op|po&s;ition made in &s;everal parts of Germany to the errors and enormities of the church of Rome had this ten|dency, to put men upon the &s;tudy of u&s;eful learning, upon &s;earching the &s;cripture and tradition; and it obliged the prelates to labour after a reformation of the clergy, &s;o generally and &s;o ju&s;tly complained of; as al&s;o to make many regulations in the di&s;cipline of the church; in which the church of France more particularly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed

<P>This &s;chi&s;m is generally con&s;idered with regard to the mea&s;ures they had taken, and the effects of them; the bu&s;ine&s;s of collation, of benefices, the re&s;ervation of annates, &amp;c. had very much incen&s;ed &s;ome of the neighbouring princes, who were jealous of their &s;ub|jects property. One of the fir&s;t &s;teps taken by the king of France was, his letters of &s;ubtraction, as they were called, which is a declaration of withdrawing from his obedience, publi&s;hed in the year 1408, which had a very good effect. But in the year 1409, a third pope was elected, to whom, though France paid obedience, yet &s;he &s;tood firm in maintaining the king's edict by which all re&s;ervations, annates, and other exactions of the court of Rome, were forbid, until they were &s;ettled by a lawful general council; and it happened at that time, that the parliament of Paris were in part compo&s;ed of coun&s;ellors that were well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws; and tho&s;e made a noble &s;tand again&s;t the en|croachments attempted to be made by the pope's eccle|&s;ia&s;tical judges.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixteenth general council, held at Con&s;tance, the &s;chi&s;m of the popes was extingui&s;hed, by one of the popes having renounced, after he had fled from the council and been brought back again and depo&s;ed, viz. John XXIII. And the two others having been depo&s;ed, viz. Gregory XII. and Benedict XIII. in the year 1417. Martin V. was elected pope at the general council.</P>
<P>Great hopes were entertained, that the council and the pope together, the two mo&s;t powerful concurrents upon earth, would &s;et them&s;elves to reform the many abu&s;es that had crept into the church; and, indeed, the council recommended it to the pope: but from their de&s;ire of returning home, and &s;ome difficulties which they found attended it, it was put off for a more convenient &s;ea&s;on,
<PB N="100" REF="235">under the direction of a future council; &s;o that council terminated April 12, 1418

<P>But they fir&s;t condemned the errors of John Hu&s;s and Wickliffe, and in which John Hu&s;s was condemned to be burnt.</P>
<P>The French not being willing to &s;tay &s;o long, a de|cree was made in the parliament of Paris, that no obe|dience &s;hould be paid to the pope, unle&s;s he fir&s;t ad|mitted, and acknowledged the king's edict
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Con&s;erence of Ordinances, lib. I. tit. iiii. p. 283.</NOTE>, which &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the re&s;ervations and exactions of money in France.</P>
<P>The pope, being apprized of this by his nuncios, agrees to it for that time; but having gained &s;ome mem|bers of the univer&s;ity to his party, in the year 1422, he again attempted to make the re&s;ervations: however, he failed in the attempt, and they proceeded to the impri&s;onment of all his adherents, the rector of the uni|ver&s;ity, and divers others of the members and fellows; and upon the pope's putting the city of Lyons under interdiction, becau&s;e that city obeyed the king's edict, the parliament &s;trictly forbad their obedience to it.</P>
<P>This di&s;pute la&s;ted till the year 1424, when matters were compromized betwixt them; they had, as it were, divided the power, and the advantages: but it did not prove to the &s;atisfaction of either parties, &s;o it la&s;ted but a little while. However, at the end of about &s;even years, Martin died, to whom &s;ucceeded Eugene IV. during who&s;e popedom, in 1431, the council of Ba&s;il took in hand the reformation &s;o nece&s;&s;ary. All re&s;er|vations were prohibited, except of tho&s;e benefices which were vacant in curia, the annates, and many other ex|actions peculiar to that court.</P>
<P>The pope finding &s;uch a check given to his power, after many attempts to obtain an alteration, came to an open rupture with them. The pope di&s;&s;olved the council&mdash;the council deprived the pope, and cho&s;e an|other.&mdash;This
<PB N="101" REF="236">bred another &s;chi&s;m in the church.&mdash;France and Germany received the decrees of this council; and in the year 1438, the famous Pragmatic Sanction, which Mezeray calls the bulwark of the Gallican church, was publi&s;hed in France, which re&s;tored the elections to the chapters, the collations to the ordinaries, and abo|li&s;hed the re&s;ervations.</P>
<P>In this century, viz. at the council of Bourges, 1438, their decrees were principally taken out of tho&s;e of the council of Ba&s;il: for when pope Eugenius u&s;ed his ut|mo&s;t endeavours to di&s;&s;olve the council of Ba&s;il, and to de&s;troy its authority, the fathers of the council &s;ent their deputies into France to pre&s;ent the decrees and con&s;ti|tutions which they had made for the reformation of, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, di&s;cipline to Charles VII. and the church of France. The king, not willing to do any thing in a matter of that importance, immediately convened a council of bi&s;hops to examine tho&s;e decrees. The re&s;ult was, giving a blow to the &s;upremacy, by that maxim, fir&s;t reduced to practice by the councils of Pi&s;a, Con&s;tance, and Ba|&s;il, and by the two la&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, as an article of faith, "That the pope is &s;ubject to a general council;" which doctrine proved the more fatal at Rome, as it has been received by the Gallican church as a mark of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>But all the regulations made by them again&s;t tho&s;e innovations in their dominion, &s;erved but to &s;harpen the indu&s;try of the court of Rome, to find out other expedients which might prove effectual for the&s;e ends, under other pretexts, as well as to &s;upply, by a multi|plication of new rights, their defect of power in matters wherein the interpo&s;ition of princes had re&s;trained them.</P>
<P>It was about this time re&s;ignations took place, it be|ing never before allowed to churchmen to quit the cure that had been a&s;&s;igned them; and till now it was thought incumbent on the mini&s;ter, who had undertaken a charge, and received a recompence for it, that he &s;hould continue to perform it to the end of his life: but how|ever, this being permitted and encouraged, it turned to the advantage of the court of Rome, as it made
<PB N="102" REF="237">the more frequent, and enlarged the &s;um ari&s;ing from annates.</P>
<P>When the re&s;ources of this kind began to dry up, in|dulgences and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins were thought of in their room, to be be&s;towed on &s;uch per&s;ons who &s;hould con|tribute money for the holy war, or any other pious u&s;es: and this matter was carried &s;o high, that every one knows, that the changes, that were made in con|&s;equence of tho&s;e indulgences, in Germany and many other parts of Europe, and which commenced pretty early in the next century, make no &s;mall part of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In Italy, where the council of Ba&s;il never was re|ceived, and the adherence to the pope was more &s;trong, the re&s;ervations had taken deeper root, every pope re|newing them with ea&s;e, and introducing new preten|&s;ions and impo&s;itions, and &s;hewing no in&s;tance of miti|gation in the rigour of any of them, except where &s;ome expedient had been found to work the &s;ame effect an ea&s;ier way.</P>
<P>In Germany, where the council of Ba&s;il was by &s;ome admitted, by others not, there was great diver&s;ity in the deci&s;ions concerning beneficiary cau&s;es. To provide again&s;t and reconcile the&s;e differences, Nich. V. and the emperor Frederic III. in the year 1448, made a con|cordat, concluded in the pope's name, to the following tenor: &mdash; That the benefices vacant in court &s;hould be re&s;erved to the pope, and that the re&s;t of the elective benefices &s;hould go by election
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Paul of Beneficiary Matters, p. 206.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In France there were warm di&s;putes &s;ub&s;i&s;ting for a con&s;iderable time, &s;ometimes the pope &s;eeming to get the better in the controver&s;y, and &s;ometimes the king of France.</P>
<P>At length Leo X. framed a concordat with king Francis I. of France, that the pragmatic &s;anction &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, and the election of bi&s;hops and abbots &s;hould be taken from the cathedral and colle|giate
<PB N="103" REF="238">churches, and given to the king, who was to name a fit per&s;on, and the pope to confer the benefice; it was farther concluded, that the pope could not give ex|pectatives, nor make any re&s;ervations, general or &s;pecial: though there was great difficulty in getting this concor|dat to be received, the univer&s;ity appealing to a general council lawfully convened, yet the king's authority and intere&s;t prevailed, and it was put in execution throughout.</P>
<P>Thus, after &s;everal popes, had between 1076 and 1150, thundered out &s;o many excommunications, and occa&s;ioned much rebellion and blood&s;hed, in order to wre&s;t from princes the collation of bi&s;hoprics, and to give the election to the chapters: on the contrary, the quarrel &s;eems now inverted, and Pius II. and five of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have, with the &s;ame zeal and con&s;tancy, been &s;truggling to take the election from the chapter, and give it to the king, which Leo the Tenth at la&s;t accompli&s;hed: &s;o true it is, that a change in intere&s;ts draws along with it both a change, and even a contra|diction, in doctrines.</P>
<P>In a council held at Rouen, 1445, we have forty con&s;titutions chiefly relating to the di&s;cipline of that church: there is one of them again&s;t the &s;uper&s;tion of tho&s;e who gave particular names to the images of the Virgin, &s;uch as our lady of recovery, our lady of pity, con&s;olation and grace: &mdash; they forbid the carry|ing about the relics of &s;aints in order to get money: clande&s;tine marriages were likewi&s;e prohibited: others related to the morals and habits of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, the celebration of holy days, the payment of tenths, orna|ments of churches, &amp;c. The&s;e regulations are taken from the councils of Ba&s;il, Lateran, the pragmatic &s;anction, decretals, and other provincial councils

<P>M. Dupin in (the preface to) his hi&s;tory of the &s;ix|teenth century ob&s;erves, that the eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory of this age de&s;erves the particular attention of all who have any concern for religion, there being no century in which there have been greater revolutions in the church. &mdash; The pope of Rome &s;aw, with grief, a great part of Europe for&s;ake their allegiance to his holine&s;s; &s;everal provinces of Germany, England, and Scotland, and &s;everal kingdoms of the North, were departed from his authority; and France, which till then had been free from &s;uch mon&s;ters, as he calls them
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Allowance mu&s;t here be made for the religious tenets of this author. I have therefore made &s;ome variations.</NOTE>, pro|duced &s;ome who were not le&s;s hurtful to the &s;tate than to the church:&mdash;"But, &s;ays he," "if the church catholic lo&s;t a good deal of its extent this way, it endeavoured to recompence the lo&s;s in &s;ome &s;ort, by the reformation of manners and di&s;cipline, putting a &s;top to the licen|&s;ing clande&s;tine marriages, and by puni&s;hing &s;candalous crimes, according to the rights of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws. For this purpo&s;e &s;o many decrees and regulations were made in eccle&s;ia&s;tical a&s;&s;emblies, and e&s;pecially in the council of Trent, which, Dupin likewi&s;e, tells us, were to condemn errors to pre&s;erve the purity of the faith, and to labour after the reformation of di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>Father Walch has given us a more particular, and I pre&s;ume impartial, view of this remarkable period. &mdash; He &s;ays, That in the fir&s;t part of it, the internal corruption of the church of Rome was
<PB N="105" REF="240">become &s;uch, as to exclude all external order and de|cency: &mdash; in the middle it received &s;uch a &s;hock, as it had never before felt, by the amazing progre&s;s of the reformation; and the latter part of this period was em|ployed in pre&s;erving the wreck, and re&s;toring, or reco|vering, what had been lo&s;t. This has been attended with many remarkable con&s;equences, &s;ome of which follow.</P>
<P>As to the &s;piritual monarchy of the pope, it was at fir&s;t greatly endangered by tho&s;e who bore te&s;timony to the truth, in &s;pite of the ba&s;e example of pope Pius II. and particularly by the proceedings of king Lewis XII. of France, and of the council of Pi&s;a again&s;t pope Julius II.</P>
<P>But the advantage became irreparable, when gra|dually a con&s;iderable part of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Hungary, and Poland, be|&s;ides all England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, and Pru&s;&s;ia, received the doctrine of the reformation, and withdrew entirely from their obedience to the &s;ee of Rome.&mdash;Be&s;ides this, tho&s;e nations, which &s;till adhered to the doctrine of the church of Rome, not only admit|ted principles quite irreconcilable with the doctrine of an infallible head of the whole church, but al&s;o parti|cularly, by the frequent complaints again&s;t the &s;ee of Rome, and their earne&s;t &s;olicitations for a council, threatened it with no &s;mall danger; and Charles V. was even actually employed, at lea&s;t in Germany, in decide|ing religious points judicially.</P>
<P>Adrian VI. in 1522, &s;ent a letter to the duke of Saxony and other princes, to extirpate the heretics, the Lutherans, by fire and &s;word, notwith&s;tanding he confe&s;&s;ed to them, that there were great abu&s;es in the church of Rome, and that the eccle&s;ia&s;tics them&s;elves &s;tood greatly in need of reformation: and even while the council of Trent were convened 1546, and de|nouncing their anathemas again&s;t the prote&s;tants, the pope and emperor prepared another &s;ort of arms again&s;t them, in order to de&s;troy their lives, as the &s;ure&s;t means
<PB N="106" REF="241">to &s;uppre&s;s here&s;y: but in this the emperor was too politic for the pope, for he took care to &s;ell &s;ome of the churches patrimony to defray the expence.</P>
<P>All this incited the &s;ee of Rome to &s;tudy expedients for the better &s;upport of the Roman catholic religion, and more e&s;pecially of the authority of the pope, and to &s;ecure it from further declen&s;ion. About this time the order of Je&s;uits, by the approbation and confirma|tion of the pope, received its entire e&s;tabli&s;hment, and became a pillar, of which the papacy &s;tood greatly in need, in 1540.</P>
<P>The council of Trent was very artfully made u&s;e of to an&s;wer the&s;e ends, quite contrary to its original de|&s;ign. The Roman legates were &s;uffered to pre&s;ide in it, and they had not the liberty of agreeing to the opi|nions, or re&s;olutions, of the fathers, without the pre|vious con&s;ent of the pope. All the doctrines, which contradicted the Romi&s;h errors, were condemned with|out hearing the prote&s;tants; and all the doctrines, pe|culiar to the church of Rome, were &s;olemnly confirmed; a majority of votes was influenced to &s;uppre&s;s the doc|trines a&s;&s;ented to by the greate&s;t part of the doctors then pre&s;ent, or they were decided by an authoritative &s;entence from Rome, if they had the lea&s;t tendency to the prejudice of the papal court: tho&s;e que&s;tions, for in&s;tance, &s;o fruitful in altercation, whether epi&s;copacy be of divine original, and whether the pope was to be accounted the head of all churches, or of the univer&s;al church, were concluded in the affirmative without de|bate; and the papal court re&s;erved and confirmed to it&s;elf, the amendment of its own abu&s;es; and in the la&s;t place, it was deemed the prerogative of the pope to interpret all the decrees; and it mu&s;t be owned, that the&s;e methods had their

<P>The pattern or method of proceeding in the council of Trent was taken from the latter occidental councils, and e&s;pecially from the la&s;t council of Lateran, by hav|ing the &s;everal matters and things laid before &s;everal per&s;ons appointed, which were denominated particular congregations; and then it was reported to the general a&s;&s;embly of bi&s;hops: and this was done with great ce|remony, and the decrees read at the conclu&s;ion by one of them, each of the other &s;ignifying his &s;entiments, by &s;aying <HI>placet,</HI> or <HI>non placet.</HI> &mdash; We likewi&s;e find, that many of the bi&s;hops met with a de&s;ign to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;uperiority of the church, and general councils over the pope; to promote a reformation in the church; and likewi&s;e with moderate di&s;po&s;itions towards &s;uch as might differ from them in &s;entiments, and recommend|ed to their collegues humility and charity: but this will not hold true of the majority: the pope's legates were pre&s;ent, and had an undue influence, as will appear in the &s;equel. &mdash; One in&s;tance appeared even in the &s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion, when many of the council were for opening that &s;e&s;&s;ion, with &s;ome propo&s;als for a general reforma|tion; but the pope's legates oppo&s;ed it, and after &s;ome
<PB N="108" REF="243">debate, cardinal Pool obtained, as a proper expedient, that the &s;ymbol of the Nicene, or creed of the church of Rome, &s;hould be confirmed; &s;ome made a je&s;t of that, as it had been received in the church for twelve hundred years; however, the more penetrating &s;aw through the policy of that &s;cheme, viz. that nothing might afterwards be propo&s;ed in oppo&s;ition to it. &mdash; The third &s;e&s;&s;ion was principally taken up with the progre&s;s that the reformation made in Germany; the elector Palatine having re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the communion under both kinds, the marriage of prie&s;ts, and the &s;ervice in the vulgar tongue; which gave great offence to the pope's legates. &mdash; In the fourth &s;e&s;&s;ion, pur&s;uant to the order given by the pope, they proceeded to take under their con&s;ideration the <HI>&s;criptures.</HI> This was re|duced to four heads, chiefly relative to &s;uch points as were intended to be condemned in the prote&s;tants, viz. the &s;ufficiency of holy &s;cripture, and the nece&s;&s;ity of traditions; the &s;econd, of the canonical books and their number; the third was about the authority of the vul|gar tran&s;lation, and the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to the originals; and the fourth related to the proper inter|preters of &s;cripture: and it was concluded, that all matters and things condemned &s;hould be by Ana|thema.</P>
<P>In the fourth &s;e&s;&s;ion they al&s;o entered upon the doctrine of original &s;in, to which there was a great oppo&s;ition: they di&s;cu&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the &s;ubtleties of that que&s;tion, as, How Adam's &s;in, which con&s;i&s;ted in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a law, could be conveyed or tran&s;mitted to his po&s;te|rity? and nine articles of the Zuinglans were con|demned as not expre&s;&s;ive, or con&s;i&s;tent, with the doc|trine of original &s;in, though they admitted a depravity or corruption of nature. The prelates di&s;pute much, but appear to be ignorant of the point, or the argu|ments, of the Zuinglans. This introduced a di&s;pute concerning the immaculate conception of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin. &mdash; The fifth &s;e&s;&s;ion related to preachers, in which the mendicant monks took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pul|pits,
<PB N="109" REF="244">but re&s;idencies enjoined upon them. &mdash; In the &s;ixth &s;e&s;&s;ion the &s;ubjects of grace and ju&s;tification, in which the point of ab&s;olute prede&s;tination, final per&s;e|verance, and the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, were taken into their con&s;ideration; and at length the decrees were made with great ambiguity, and with &s;uch pro|vi&s;oes, as permitted the pope, or the church, finally to determine it. &mdash; In the &s;eventh &s;e&s;&s;ion the council di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed the points of bapti&s;m and extreme unction: their ordinances on the&s;e points were merely trifling, notwith&s;tanding they be&s;towed anathema's on &s;uch who did not deem them &s;acred; &s;ome abu&s;es from plurality of benefices were mentioned, but it terminated in the authority of di&s;pen&s;ations. &mdash; The eighth &s;e&s;&s;ion was concerning the removal of the council to Bologna, which pa&s;&s;ed in the affirmative.</P>
<P>The ninth &s;e&s;&s;ion, and fir&s;t of Bologna, &s;ettled only the formularies of the a&s;&s;embly. In 1547, a diet at Aug&s;burg was held, in which they promi&s;ed to &s;ubmit to that council; neverthele&s;s, when the council did not coincide with their principles, they acted in oppo&s;ition it, more from policy than regard to truth, and though much in favour of prote&s;tants, and liberty of con&s;cience, was not regarded by many of them as &s;ub&s;tantial and la&s;ting.</P>
<P>In 1549 pope Paul died. Julius III. &s;ucceeded him, who was prevailed on, by the emperor, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the council at Trent, wherein the emperor was to pre|&s;ide, and the prote&s;tants of Aug&s;bug have free liberty to be heard concerning the points of faith in which they differed from the church of Rome: but we meet with no &s;uch happy con&s;equences ari&s;ing from it, nei|ther in the eleventh nor twelfth &s;e&s;&s;ion. However, in the thirteenth &s;e&s;&s;ion, the council enters upon bu&s;ine&s;s, chu&s;es the point of the euchari&s;t for doctrine, and the juri&s;diction of bi&s;hops for reformation; the fir&s;t of the&s;e was debated for &s;ome time: at length, decreed, that communion in one kind was &s;ufficient, and pronounced
<PB N="110" REF="245">anathema's again&s;t &s;uch as denied the real pre&s;ence, tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, the adoration, of the ho&s;t, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In 1521 was held the congregation, con&s;i&s;ting only of doctors of the canon law, for handling the matter of di&s;cipline, which is the original of the juri&s;diction of the tribunals of the church. This congregation was held at Trent, but did not interfere with the council of prelates. Gropper votes for the aboli&s;hing an eccle|&s;ia&s;tical tribunal, and wrote again&s;t it. This introduced the original of degradations, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The thirteenth &s;e&s;&s;ion of the council of Trent con|firmed the decrees and anathemas of the council, in the former &s;e&s;&s;ion, again&s;t tho&s;e who denied the commu|nion in one kind, the real pre&s;ence, &amp;c. Penance, extreme unction, and the reformation in favour of the epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, were points determined; but they could not agree with re&s;pect to decrees, which were therefore referred to &s;ome future time; afterwards was re-a&s;&s;umed in the third convocation of the council under pope Pius IV.</P>
<P>The fourteenth &s;e&s;&s;ion, the council refu&s;e to hear the prote&s;tants, notwith&s;tanding the emperor's promi&s;e; however, a new, &s;afe conduct was obtained for &s;ome of the prote&s;tants of Wirtenberg and Bohemia, and au|dience was given to the amba&s;&s;adors of Saxony, which principally engaged the attention of the council the fifteenth, &s;ixteenth, &s;eventeenth, and eighteenth &s;e&s;&s;ions: however. in Augu&s;t, 1552, the landgrave of He&s;&s;e was enlarged, liberty of con&s;cience granted under cer|tain re&s;trictions, and bani&s;hed mini&s;ters recalled.</P>
<P>In 1553, another remarkable event intervened. Edward VI. king of England died, July 6, and Mary, his &s;i&s;ter, &s;ucceeded to the throne, who pretended at fir&s;t, that &s;he would alter nothing in religion, though &s;he was a Roman catholic; but this promi&s;e was &s;oon counteracted by her attempts to introduce the Roman catholic religion into the&s;e kingdoms.</P>
<P>In 1555, a diet was called at Aug&s;burg, for com|po&s;ing the troubles in religion, during which the pope
<PB N="111" REF="246">died. Paul IV. &s;ucceeded him, who&s;e character was that of proud and in&s;olent. The diet made a decree in favour of liberty of con&s;cience, which &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed the pope, that he li&s;tened to the per&s;ua&s;ions of &s;ome, to &s;upport his authority by the &s;word; but party quar|rels with princes &s;eem to have diverted him from the intention he had formed.</P>
<P>In 1558, Mary, queen of England, died, and her &s;i&s;ter, Elizabeth. &s;ucceeded, which was looked upon as a mortal blow to the &s;ee of Rome. She thought it to no purpo&s;e to di&s;&s;emble, with re&s;pect to her princi|ples; and therefore &s;ent advice to her &s;i&s;ters amba&s;|&s;ador at Rome, and ordered him to acquaint the pope of her advancement to the throne. The pope an&s;wered, that &s;he had been very bold to take the crown and name of queen without his leave.</P>
<P>In 1561, the pope, by his bull, invites not only catholic but prote&s;tant princes to the council of Trent, and di&s;patches the abbot Martimengo to the queen of England; but, as &s;oon as it was known to her, &s;he forbad him to enter her dominions. A conference was likewi&s;e appointed at Poi&s;&s;y, between the Roman ca|tholics and the prote&s;tants. The council at Trent met in 1562, called the &s;eventeenth &s;e&s;&s;ion, or the fir&s;t of the third convocation, in which the books written in &s;upport of here&s;y, as they termed it, were ordered to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and an edict publi&s;hed for the &s;afe con|duct of the German prote&s;tants. In the eighteenth &s;e&s;&s;ion, they enter upon the point of the re&s;idence of bi&s;hops, and the que&s;tion, If it be of divine right? was &s;tarted and argued with great warmth, which la&s;ted the nineteenth &s;e&s;&s;ion. In the twentieth, they re|a&s;&s;umed the di&s;pute of communion in both kinds, and concluded it again in the negative; and it was confirmed in the twenty-fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, then the matter of the &s;acra|fice of the ma&s;s was cho&s;en for their deliberation. This head was divided into thirteen articles, wherein were comprehended all the controver&s;ies about that &s;ubject, which are at this day argued between the church of
<PB N="112" REF="247">Rome and the prote&s;tants, viz. Whether the ma&s;s be a propitiatory &s;acrifice? Whether it derogates from the &s;acrifice of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Whether Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by &s;ay|ing, <HI>Do this,</HI> hath appointed the &s;acrifice of his body? Whether private ma&s;&s;es be lawful and good? Whether it be lawful to celebrate ma&s;&s;es in honour of &s;aints? Whether the ceremonies of the ma&s;s are good and holy? Whether there be errors in the canon of the ma&s;s? Whether the words of con&s;ecration ought to be pro|nounced with a low voice? with other que&s;tions of little importance.</P>
<P>The French &s;tayed at the council with very little &s;a|tisfaction; for they &s;aw that matters of the highe&s;t mo|ment were determined with very little regard to the prelates of their nation, and by the Spani&s;h, Portu|gue&s;e, and Italian bi&s;hops, and that all propo&s;als to a reformation were over-ruled by a number of pen&s;ion|ary bi&s;hops, a&s;&s;erting, that the court of Rome was mi&s;tre&s;s of all deliberations, as well as propo&s;itions: &s;o that the giving or with-holding the cup from the laity was referred to the deci&s;ion of the pope.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion affords us further proof, that the bi&s;hops were ill &s;atisfied of the infallibility of the council; and the amba&s;&s;adors of France received new orders from their court, for a&s;&s;erting their di&s;ap|probation of the mea&s;ures taken by the council. The &s;acrament of orders was handled, and whether the Holy Gho&s;t be given in ordination; which was deter|mined in the affirmative. The Germans que&s;tion the divine right of epi&s;copacy, which occa&s;ioned very warm debates.</P>
<P>The French begin the new year, 1563, with thirty-four new demands, relating to abu&s;es, which greatly alarmed the pope when communicated to him. A decree is &s;ent from Rome concerning the pope's autho|rity, which met with much contradiction. They like|wi&s;e debated the &s;ubject of marriages and divorce, and of the celibacy of prie&s;ts; wherein it was con|cluded, that it could not be &s;aid, without here&s;y,
<PB N="113" REF="248">that a prie&s;t could marry notwith&s;tanding their vow. The pope, much di&s;&s;atisfied with the conduct of &s;ome of the French, ordered the tribunal of the inqui&s;ition to proceed again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The twenty-third and twenty-fourth &s;e&s;&s;ion turned upon &s;ome difference that had ari&s;en between the pope and the king of France, and with the queen of Na|varre, on the &s;u&s;picion of here&s;y.</P>
<P>The twenty-fifth and la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of this council, held Dec. 3, 1563, the prelates and amba&s;&s;adors went to church with the u&s;ual ceremonies, when Jerome Ragaz|zone, titular bi&s;hop of Nazianzo, made a &s;ermon in prai&s;e of the council, recapiculated the good laws and ordinances which were made in it, and read the decrees concerning purgatory, the interce&s;&s;ion and invocation of &s;aints, images, and their wor&s;hip; they al&s;o read the decree for reformation of monks, containing twenty chapters, and one was added to &s;hield the pope's autho|rity, and to leave him in full liberty to di&s;pen&s;e with all the canons. &mdash; The &s;econd day they al&s;o read the decrees concerning indulgences, the choice of meats, fa&s;ts, and holy days; they made an act of reference to the pope about the index expurgatorius, mi&s;&s;als, bre|viaries, ceremonials, and the care of making a cate|chi&s;m.</P>
<P>This la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the council gave as little &s;atisfac|tion as the re&s;t had done; for after all the fair promi&s;es of &s;etting about a reformation, there was nothing of im|portance effected, except &s;ome regulations that pro|perly belonged to civil government. Germany &s;lighted the council to the highe&s;t degree; for the prelates of this nation had not been pre&s;ent in the la&s;t convocation; very few bi&s;hops from Hungary or Poland; none at all from England, Swedeland, Denmark, or the Low Countries; the French bi&s;hops came only at the latter end; and including the Spaniards, they did not exceed the number of forty: all the re&s;t were Italians, to the number of 150, and therefore it had the name of the Council of the Pope and the Italians. The pope, on
<PB N="114" REF="249">the 26th of December, gave the bull of confirmation, wherein he forbids, under pain of excommunication, the publi&s;hing of any commentaries, or ob&s;ervations, upon the councils, ordaining, in all doubtful ca&s;es, re|cour&s;e to be had to the holy &s;ee.</P>
<P>What regard was paid to this council by the French, is evident from the following citation: for, at the clo&s;ing of the council of Trent, Du Ferrier, the king's amba&s;&s;ador, entered his prote&s;t again&s;t every thing of a civil nature, that had been tran&s;acted in that a&s;&s;embly. We find, by a letter of John de Mervilliers to his nephew, the bi&s;hop of Rennes, amba&s;&s;ador to the court of Vienna, dated from Fontainebleau the third of March, that "As &s;oon as the cardinal was returned from the council, the pre&s;idents of the parliament and the king's council, were &s;ummoned to court to &s;ee the decrees and acts of that a&s;&s;embly; and the matter be|ing debated, the attorney general &s;aid, That with re|gard to the doctrine, the parliament did not intend to meddle with it, but held every thing as &s;ound and ortho|dox, that was determined in a general and lawful coun|cil: but, as for the decrees of di&s;cipline and reforma|tion, they had found in &s;everal things, derogatory to the rights and privileges of the Gallican church, and therefore to be rejected
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Henault, abridged by Nugent, p. i. p. 416.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Further means for promoting the grand point of the pope's &s;upremacy, were the inqui&s;ition of Italy, the Je|&s;uits, the Mi&s;&s;ions prohibiting books, and other mea|&s;ures to dive&s;t all temporal &s;overeigns from any juri&s;|diction in &s;piritual affairs. &mdash; The&s;e things &s;ufficiently &s;hew the pope's de&s;ign to erect an univer&s;al &s;upremacy; yet, in the exerci&s;e of it; the pope's hands have been tied by the cardinals and congregations. &mdash; This power &s;eemed to increa&s;e, and the popes became more and more &s;hackled, which no pope better under&s;tood than Sixtus V. who fir&s;t conceived that prote&s;tanti&s;m might accidentally be turned to the advantage of the pope; but this project was defeated by the general con&s;titu|tion of Europe, the pragmatic &s;anction.</P>

<HEAD>CENTURY THE SEVENTEENTH.</HEAD>
<P>In this century we find the popes have been more concerned for the pre&s;ervation than the increa&s;e of their power and authority, and they &s;eem to have been thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch conduct.</P>
<P>Their &s;piritual monarchy, in its external limits, has, doubtle&s;s, been rather contracted then extended, though the per&s;ecutions of the prote&s;tants in Germany, Hun|gary, and France, have not indeed been totally with|out effect. The &s;everal acce&s;&s;ions of great princes to the church of Rome have not been detrimental to the pope; and the mi&s;&s;ions, among the heathens and Ea&s;tern nations, have unque&s;tionably contributed &s;ome|thing to the propagation of the Romi&s;h faith.</P>
<P>But it would be no difficulty to &s;hew, that all the&s;e means have been far from an&s;wering their end in the manner expected; that the endeavours u&s;ed for bring|ing back the prote&s;tants under the old yoke, e&s;pecially in England, have mi&s;carried; that the prote&s;tants, by a clo&s;er union, and the progre&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of their power, have gradually, in effect, weakened Roman ca|tholic hou&s;es; and the propagation of popery has been not a little re&s;trained by public laws

<P>It is only in the writings of the bigots of Rome, and in the pro&s;&s;e&s;&s;orial chains of the Je&s;uits, that the inward con&s;titution of this &s;upremacy remains unal|tered; for if, in&s;tead of looking into the Roman cate|chi&s;m for what ought to take place, we con&s;ider the actual &s;tate of things, we mu&s;t admit the ob|&s;ervation of Mon&s;ieur Voltaire, though made &s;ome time &s;ince, "That in the opinion of the great, at lea&s;t, the infallibility of the pope, with the power founded in it, is a chimera, not believed even at Rome, and yet

See Voltaire's Siecle de Louis XIV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ju&s;tice of this idea of the pope and his infalli|bility appears from all the tran&s;actions with the crowns of France, Spain, Sardinia, Naples, the republic of Venice, and even the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>It is &s;till more evident, that in church affairs, and even in ca&s;es relating to the per&s;ons of eccle&s;ia&s;tics and church-lands, the temporal princes and &s;tates have di&s;|covered and a&s;&s;erted their ancient rights; that in France tho&s;e obnoxious decrees of the councils of Con|&s;tance and Ba&s;il have not been admitted as articles of fsith; that the papal bulls are no further &s;ubmitted to, than as they corre&s;pond with the prevailing maxims of the &s;tate; that, on the&s;e accounts, the popes are very cautious of hazarding a deci&s;ion in doctrinal controver|&s;ies; that none prove more refractory &s;ons of the Ro|man father than the Je&s;uits, when his will and their's happen to cla&s;h.</P>
<P>Of late the pope has not been allowed to make any new conque&s;t. Ca&s;tro, Renciglione, Comacchio, Par|ma, and Placentia, are clear proofs that it was never imagined the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of St. Peter were to bring armies into the field; and the forwardne&s;s of any to make good their preten&s;ions that way, of which there have been too many in&s;tances, is looked upon as a di&s;|grace to the character of a pope.</P>
<P>The elections of popes are more and more carried on by intrigue, but, at the &s;ame time, more and more corrupt: the principal authority and influence of the pope &s;eem rather to unite or center in the courts
<PB N="117" REF="254">of Madrid and Rome, than at Ver&s;ailles or any other court.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to doctrine and ceremonies, notwith|&s;tanding the council of Trent adju&s;ted matters of this nature, for the mo&s;t part, not only by decrees of the council, but in all difficult matters referred to the fu|ture deci&s;ion of the pope; yet we find, very early in this century, many di&s;putes were agitated, viz. The con|trover&s;y concerning grace and free-will, held at Lou|vain before Clement VIII. and Paul V. the pope publi&s;hed a decree in 1611, by which he ordered, that nothing &s;hould be publi&s;hed, relating to the&s;e matters, upon any pretence what&s;oever. This decree was re|newed by Urban VIII. 1625, but tho&s;e prohibitions had no effect; for there appeared a variety of treati&s;es of both &s;ides upon the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>Another di&s;pute was revived concerning eccle&s;ia&s;tical and political authority. This was chiefly managed between the lawyers and the divines. It was occa&s;i|oned by the pope's interdict of the republic of Venice, and was calculated to maintain, on one hand, the au|thority of the &s;enate, to make &s;uch laws as concerned the civil &s;tate of that republic; and that the pope had no right to publi&s;h an interdict on that account. This di&s;pute terminated in favour of the rights of princes, in oppo&s;ition to the pretended authority of the pope.</P>
<P>Jan&s;eni&s;m prevailed greatly in France about the middle of this century, which occa&s;ioned three a&s;&s;em|blies of the clergy at Paris, in 1653, 1654, and 1655, who drew up a formulary, in order to terminate the di&s;pute, which was confirmed by the king's man|damus.</P>
<P>Another di&s;pute in this century was concerning the frequency of receiving the communion, which was managed with &s;ome warmth, but admitted of no &s;atis|factory deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>But a controver&s;y of more importance took place about the year 1680, between the clergy of France
<PB N="118" REF="255">and the court of Rome, about the regale. The regale is a right, by which the king enjoys the revenues of the archbi&s;hoprics and bi&s;hoprics of the kingdom, and confers benefices during the vacancy of the &s;ees, till &s;uch time as the incumbent has taken the oath of allegiance; and this the king claimed as a right that did belong to him univer&s;ally throughout his domi|nion, except two or three provinces. Pope Innocent XI. &s;eemed determined to oppo&s;e his claim: at length, in 1681, was held a national council, or general coun|cil of the clergy, to regulate this di&s;pute, who acknow|ledged his maje&s;ty's right of the regale over all churches of the kingdom, and compri&s;ed the whole matter in four articles: 1. That kings and princes are not &s;ub|ject to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, as to their temporals. 2.

<HEAD>CENTURY THE EIGHTEENTH.</HEAD>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this century we &s;hall attempt in a general way, by enquiring a little further into the nature of the papal power, the prerogatives and influence of this &s;piritual monarchy, as it was exerci&s;ed immediately preceding the reformation, and which the pre&s;ent prin|ciples of that church direct and countenance them in the exerci&s;e of.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider, that the popes ri&s;e to that dignity from very inferior &s;tations, were heretofore frequently, and are &s;till &s;ometimes, of mean families, without any
<PB N="119" REF="256">&s;upport from kindred or relations, deriving a great part of their revenues from the &s;ubjects of other princes, and this in virtue of their claiming a greater &s;hare in their allegiance, exerci&s;ing an authority grounded only in opinion, and frequently a&s;&s;uming a &s;uperiority over tho&s;e, to whom they have not been them&s;elves in obe|dience; when this is duly con&s;idered, we cannot help wondering, that this eccle&s;ia&s;tical empire has &s;tood &s;o long, grown up to &s;o great a height, and continues yet to enjoy a green old age, that does not &s;eem to betray any &s;ymptoms of a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>But, upon a nearer and clo&s;er in&s;pection, we &s;hall find, that this &s;piritual monarchy, like &s;ome of the leaning towers that have been &s;o famous in hi&s;tory, tho' it &s;eems to carry evident marks of weakne&s;s, is, in fact, a &s;tructure very &s;trong in it&s;elf, contrived with great &s;kill, as well as erected with much art. If in other monarchies princes have pretended to a divine right, the pope goes &s;till further, and claims a kind of divine power, by which he is rai&s;ed as much above other princes, as tho&s;e princes are above their people. This claim, together with the title of Holine&s;s, having the recommendation of a long pre&s;cription, cannot but excite an high veneration in the minds of &s;uch as be|lieve it, the papal character being given with the greate&s;t ceremony, by tho&s;e who are pre&s;umed to be the be&s;t judges of religion; and the religious intere&s;t &s;eem, in the opinion of the multitude, to alter the very nature of him who is adorned therewith, and to transform him, from a man of like pa&s;&s;ions with them|&s;elves, into a &s;acred per&s;on. It is true, that, in pro|te&s;tant countries, as nothing of this is believed, &s;o it is very hard to be under&s;tood; yet the fact is beyond di&s;pute: and, whatever wi&s;er per&s;ons in popi&s;h king|doms may conceive, the bulk of the people have the highe&s;t reverence for the holy father.</P>
<P>The clo&s;e connection between the clergy in all popi&s;h countries and the court of Rome, joined to the occa|&s;ional benefits that monarchs them&s;elves may receive by
<PB N="120" REF="257">bulls from the holy &s;ee, makes them unwilling to in|terpo&s;e or break off that commerce which their &s;ubjects have with Rome, that, upon certain occa&s;ions, they may derive favours from thence, which may ea&s;ily procure what otherwi&s;e might with difficulty be ob|tained by their own authority. The &s;ubjection of the clergy to a foreign head, makes them &s;ometimes more tractable to their natural &s;overeigns than they otherwi&s;e would be, &s;ince the good-will and friend&s;hip of a &s;ingle per&s;on is more ea&s;ily attained than the direction of many; and be&s;ides, in tho&s;e ca&s;es, there can be no appeal to the people; becau&s;e, in all &s;uch di&s;|putes, they think an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the duty of the clergy. We may add to this another rea&s;on, which is, that the popi&s;h princes cheri&s;h the &s;piritual power of the pope, as the means of pre&s;erving unity in religious di&s;putes, which very &s;eldom di&s;turb the church without di&s;turbing the &s;tate al&s;o. Thus it appears that, inde|pendent of enthu&s;ia&s;m and &s;uper&s;tition, political prin|ciples have no &s;mall &s;hare in promoting that adherence to the &s;ee of Rome, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;eems &s;o irre|concilable to the ab&s;olute authority of &s;overeign princes, and which, notwith&s;tanding, by their dexterous ma|nagement, is often made to co-operate therewith.</P>
<P>As to the interior &s;trength of the papal government, we need only reflect, that the advantages of birth are well &s;upplied by the great parts, and other qualifications, with which a man mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily endowed, who is promoted to this dignity. His being obliged to celi|bacy is another point of great con&s;equence, ina&s;much as it prevents the changing this elective into an here|ditary &s;overeignty, which would be entirely repugnant to the fundamental maxims of this con&s;titution. We may add to this, the precautions taken in electing a per&s;on far advanced in years, which leaves no room for attempting to alter the &s;ettled principles of the government; and all great politicians allow, that it is the &s;acrificing the&s;e to the intere&s;t of a family, or to the private advantage of the reigning prince, that opens a
<PB N="121" REF="258">way to the ruin of the be&s;t-dige&s;ted &s;y&s;tems. It has al&s;o been an old rule in the conclave, never to elect two popes of the &s;ame family or faction, or even of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, in immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, for the &s;ame rea&s;on. In &s;hort, it would be endle&s;s to enume|rate particulars; but the character of the church of Rome, in re&s;pect to policy, has always &s;tood &s;o high, as to be thought the be&s;t &s;chool for training mini&s;ters in all the popi&s;h monarchies, from whence al&s;o it draws great advantages.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not, however, imagine from hence, that becau&s;e the fundamental maxims of the &s;ee of Rome have been always the &s;ame, the admini&s;tration of the government has been exactly uniform, &s;ince, con&s;ider|ing the va&s;t variations in mens temper's and habits in different ages, this mu&s;t appear a thing ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible: neither ought we to imagine, that any con&s;titution could be &s;o framed, as to extingui&s;h in the minds of princes all natural regard to their families: but on the one hand, &s;uch has been the &s;kill and capacity of the&s;e &s;piritual monarchs, that from time to time they have made &s;uch prudent alterations in their exte|rior conduct, as hath perfectly kept up that relation between the church and the court of Rome, upon which their authority depends: they have likewi&s;e, on the other, reduced their family tenderne&s;&s;es into a kind of &s;y&s;tem, by which the nepoti&s;m of the Roman pon|tiffs has been in many reigns &s;ub&s;ervient to the intere&s;t of the &s;tate, as well as agreeable to the inclination of the popes, who thought they could never tru&s;t their affairs in &s;o &s;afe hands for them&s;elves, as with tho&s;e who mu&s;t be con&s;cious, that their wealth, their influence, and their power, mu&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, determine with the life of him from whom they were received, and that, be&s;ides, they mu&s;t, from that moment, lie open to the &s;tricte&s;t enquiries po&s;&s;ible into their pa&s;t conduct.</P>
<P>One may, with great truth and impartiality, venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the whole &s;cheme of the Romi&s;h religion
<PB N="122" REF="259">is admirably well adju&s;ted to maintain, in every re&s;pect, the power of the &s;upreme head: he is reputed infallible, that his deci&s;ions may have the greater weight: the tra|ditions of the church, which, with the members of it, pa&s;s for a rule of faith, are &s;ubject to his controul; all religious doctrines are liable to his cen&s;ure; the power of ab&s;olution, even in the highe&s;t ca&s;es, is attributed to him; he di&s;pen&s;es the trea&s;ures of the church, I mean &s;piritual trea&s;ures, &s;uch as pardons and indulgences; he grants di&s;pen&s;ations of all kinds; he regulates fa&s;ts and fea&s;ts at his plea&s;ure: in a word, being reputed the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or of St. Peter, and the vi&s;ible head of the Chri&s;tian church, he has prerogatives without bounds, and with|out number; &s;o that it is no &s;urpri&s;ing thing at all, that &s;o much power, directed by &s;o great policy, &s;hould be able to perform &s;uch mighty things, and to pre&s;erve it|&s;elf for &s;o many ages.</P>
<P>But our e&s;timate of this power would be extremely imperfect, if we did not take notice of the &s;everal ranks and orders of men &s;ubject, in an e&s;pecial manner, to the holy &s;ee; and which, without any great impropriety in the term, may be &s;tyled the &s;piritual forces of his holi|ne&s;s. In the fir&s;t cla&s;s of the&s;e &s;tand the cardinals, who are acknowledged princes of the church, and pretend to the next in dignity to crowned heads; they were origi|nally no more than the pari&s;h prie&s;ts of Rome, and their number &s;ometimes greater, &s;ometimes le&s;s; but now it is fixed to &s;eventy-two, in allu&s;ion to Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples: heretofore a cardinal was content to be &s;tyled his excellency; but now they a&s;&s;ume the title of emi|nence, which was formerly given to princes, and there|upon the latter took the title of highne&s;s; the cardinals are of all nations, that the influence ari&s;ing from the hopes of this dignity may be the more exten&s;ive: the nomina|tion to hats by crowned heads is a new &s;troke of Romi&s;h policy, which heightens the dependence upon the holy &s;ee, while it &s;eems to le&s;&s;en the papal authority; the majority, however, are chiefly Italians, to prevent the throne from being filled by a &s;tranger; and it is pro|vided,
<PB N="123" REF="260">that in all elections the per&s;on cho&s;en &s;hall have the voices of two thirds of tho&s;e who enter the conclave, that there may never be a &s;trong faction again&s;t the pope among&s;t the cardinals, which might be attended with ill con&s;equences. All the &s;ubordinate dignities of the church may be con&s;idered as the nobility in the pope's &s;piritual empire.</P>
<P>But as in all others, &s;o in this, the &s;trength of the mo|narchy con&s;i&s;ts in the number of its &s;ubjects; and if we take into our view the &s;ecular and regular clergy in the church of Rome, the former bound by the mo&s;t &s;acred ties, and the latter not by vows only, but by their inte|re&s;ts to the obedience of the holy &s;ee, we cannot but en|tertain a high opinion of its power; &s;ince long ago it was the calculation of a certain &s;overeign, that in Europe he had three hundred thou&s;and pari&s;hes, and fifty thou|&s;and convents, &s;ubject to his juri&s;diction, who, more or le&s;s, upon different occa&s;ions, re&s;ort to Rome, and carry thither an immen&s;e trea&s;ure. And it is very ea&s;y to di&s;cern, that nothing has been neglected which could po&s;&s;ibly contribute to render the foundations of this mo|narchy firm and &s;trong: the mo&s;t important tru&s;t of educating youth is entirely in their hands who are de|voted to the &s;ervice of the holy &s;ee; the Je&s;uits are par|ticularly famous for their application in this re&s;pect, and when they have received the fir&s;t tincture of literature, &s;uch as are &s;ent to compleat their &s;tudies at the univer|&s;ities, meet with the &s;ame doctrine and di&s;cipline; and whatever the &s;cience be to which they apply, venera|tion for the pope is a thing &s;o frequently in&s;i&s;ted on, and &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould ever lo&s;e it while they remain at tho&s;e &s;eminaries of learning, and attend the offices of the church. Be|&s;ides the&s;e, the number of inferior clergy, who enjoy eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices of all &s;orts, are &s;o numerous, and afford &s;uch ample maintenance, and &s;uch agreeable pro&s;pects to men of all ranks and tempers, in conjunc|tion with the canon law, which is peculiar to this &s;pi|ritual monarchy, that the mo&s;t effectual provi&s;ion is
<PB N="124" REF="261">made for a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons, bound to &s;up|port that intere&s;t, which is the &s;upport of them&s;elves and all their preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>As the&s;e are bound by affection, and by finding their own account, to a con&s;tant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;o the proper methods have been taken for &s;ubjecting the laics in that church al&s;o to &s;uch an obedience as they cannot well break through. Among&s;t the&s;e we may reckon auricular confe&s;&s;ion, ma&s;&s;es for the dead, the direction of female con&s;ciences, the opportunities they have of working upon per&s;ons in their dying moments; and many more circum&s;tances that might be mentioned, favourable to their intere&s;t, afford us a rea&s;onable probability that the papal authority will not decline much more than it has already done, e&s;pecially if &s;ucceeding popes imitate the moderation of their immediate predece&s;&s;ors, and en|deavour to &s;upport their influence rather by addre&s;s than by the force of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures, which is a &s;ort of artillery that no longer does the execution it did in the darker ages, when the little learning there was remain|ed entirely among the prie&s;ts and the monks.</P>
<P>The reader will apprehend this more clearly, if he takes a &s;hort view of the European powers, that &s;till profe&s;s obedience to the &s;ee of Rome. In Poland the clergy are numerous and well provided for, having a great &s;hare of power allotted them by the con&s;titution, and are for the mo&s;t part compo&s;ed of the younger &s;ons of the nobility.&mdash;In Germany it is vi&s;ible, that the po|pi&s;h religion rather prevails than declines, and the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical electors and other prelates are &s;o formidable a body in the diet, as not to be apprehen&s;ive of any future &s;ecularizations. It is, be&s;ides, the intere&s;t of fe|veral great hou&s;es to &s;upport the church, as it is now con&s;tituted, on the &s;core of the preferments, which are in a manner entailed on the younger &s;ons of their fa|mily, &s;o as not only to afford them noble e&s;tabli&s;hments, but al&s;o render them capable of &s;upporting the head of their hou&s;e, in&s;tead of being a burthen upon him, as would be the ca&s;e if tho&s;e dignities were &s;ecularized.
<PB N="125" REF="262">&mdash;The hereditary countries of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria re|main &s;trictly attached to the &s;ee of Rome.&mdash;The French, or Gallican church has, indeed, always claimed a kind of freedom, which having been improved by the &s;truggles that have been heretofore made again&s;t them, the modern popes have wi&s;ely had recour&s;e to another method, which &s;eems to have had a better effect, and whil&s;t the courts of Rome and Ver&s;ailles agree, both will find their account in the reciprocal &s;upport of each other's power.&mdash;In Spain and Portugal the papal au|thority &s;tands upon a much &s;tronger foundation, as ap|pears from the amazing wealth of the clergy in the for|mer, and the joy with which the &s;overeign of the lat|ter accepted very lately, from the pope, the title of <HI>Mo&s;t Faithful,</HI> (conferred by a bull from the pope, Jan. 1749) as well as many in&s;tances of a &s;uper&s;titious re|gard to the doctrines and practices of that church.&mdash; In Italy the influence of the pope extends every where, and he is &s;o able to make either his favour or his di&s;|plea&s;ure felt, that all the princes and &s;tates of his com|munion, find it their intere&s;t to live upon good terms with his holine&s;s, and as none under&s;tand their own intere&s;t better, are like to continue in the &s;ame incli|nations, received from their ance&s;tors, in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>It has been generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that one of the maxims of the &s;ee of Rome has been, attaching it&s;elf to the &s;uperior intere&s;t, and always courting that power mo&s;t which is uppermo&s;t; and, in proof of this, much has and may be &s;aid: but at the &s;ame time it is very cer|tain, that the true intere&s;t of the holy &s;ee con&s;i&s;ts in &s;upporting the balance of power, becau&s;e its influence depends chiefly upon an equality among the princes of that communion; and if any of the&s;e &s;hould gain an entire a&s;cendency, the &s;ee of Rome could not fail of feeling the fir&s;t effects of it. This is not only evident in &s;peculation, but from experience likewi&s;e.&mdash;The truth is, that while the court of Rome continues famous for policy, we can never expect her falling from this maxim; for as, in decency, it imports the holy
<PB N="126" REF="263">father to &s;hew an equal affection for all who profe&s;s them&s;elves his children, whereby he may be&s;t &s;ecure their reciprocal affection, duty and confidence

<P>The&s;e points may be further illu&s;trated, were we to con&s;ider his temporal authority, which the Roman pon|tiff enjoys in con&s;equence of his dominions in Italy and el&s;ewhere. He is lord of con&s;iderable territories, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of gold and &s;ilver, which St. Peter, even admitting him to have been bi&s;hop of Rome, certain|ly did not bequeath to the &s;ee. What the dominions of the pope are, what his revenues and riches, nor whether the&s;e are lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, is not my province to enquire. It is not only probable, but unque&s;tion|able, that the&s;e are more the &s;upport of his &s;upremacy and authority in the church, than any real per&s;ua&s;ion of his infalibillity and divine right; though to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch &s;entiments hath been made the &s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s of the Je&s;uits.</P>
<P>1713. Pope Clement XI. was prevailed with by the Je&s;uits at Paris, to i&s;&s;ue the bull Unigenitus, which chiefly relates to points of di&s;pute between the Jan&s;e|ni&s;ts and the Dominicans, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing the pope's authority. This bull, be&s;ides being an evidence that the pope may err, both in matters of faith and hi&s;torical facts, proved the means of greatly endanger|ing the authority of the pope; it kindled a flame in France which &s;pread over the whole Romi&s;h church: broke out more violently after the death of Lewis XIV. The new king of Sicily would not part with his mo|narchy; and the zeal which the pope manife&s;ted, &s;erved only to increa&s;e the papal pen&s;ioners, among whom was now the Pretender, as he could no longer &s;tay in France; for the bull, which begins with the pa&s;toral of|fice, made no impre&s;&s;ions in France; and from the grow|ing oppo&s;ition that was made to it, not only in France, but in the Low Countries and Germany, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e his be&s;t efforts in its defence; but
<PB N="127" REF="264">finding him&s;elf unequal to the ta&s;k, he con&s;ented at length to &s;ome overtures.</P>
<P>Benedict XIII. di&s;covered a more pacific di&s;po&s;ition, and was much di&s;appointed in the great good he ex|pected from the Je&s;uits; for he found them more active in &s;upport of the bull Unigenitus than he could have wi&s;hed. However, notwith&s;tanding cardinal de Noailles, and cardinal Fleury, &amp;c. &s;ub&s;cribed it, Bene|dict always continued a &s;taunch Dominican. He pub|li&s;hed the bull Petio&s;us, which the Je&s;uits will hardly admit to be a ju&s;t expo&s;ition of the doctrine of grace. We mu&s;t not omit this pope's pacific di&s;po&s;ition, to reconcile the Roman, Greek, Lutheran, and reformed parties; and is more famous for per&s;onal endowments, e&s;pecially learning, than for the pro&s;perity of his pon|tificate.</P>
<P>The intrigues and cla&s;hings among the &s;everal Roman catholic courts, and the ambitious &s;chemes of the cardinals (who now obtained the title of Eminences), the artifice and indu&s;try of the Je&s;uits and other or|ders of prie&s;ts, &s;erved to weaken the power and in|fluence of the popes. The occurrences of latter times convince us, that the mea&s;ures, particularly of the Je&s;uits, rendered them &s;u&s;pected of being &s;o en|tirely the emi&s;&s;aries of the pope, as to di&s;turb the peace and tranquillity of kingdoms.</P>
<P>The late extirpations of the order of Je&s;uits, in Por|tugal and in France, are undeniable proofs that the pope's authority is no longer ab&s;olute, but limited and re&s;trained, where the Je&s;uits have attempted an undue influence, or their principles, and their numbers, riches, and uncon&s;titutional mea&s;ures, have been found inconvenient, or prejudicial to the civil &s;tate of the kingdom.</P>
<P>In latter times the progre&s;s of arts and &s;ciences, and of learning in general, may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a very con&s;iderable means of limiting that unbound|ed power and authority of the pope, &s;o long u&s;urped, and to weaken and de&s;troy &s;uch attempts as were made
<PB N="128" REF="265">upon the rights of princes; and at the &s;ame time to remove that unrea&s;onable &s;uper&s;tition that too generally prevailed in the minds of the common people for whatever had the &s;anction of papal authority; and this is equally applicable to tho&s;e errors and corruptions in doctrine, wor&s;hip, and ceremonies, that have in pro|ce&s;s of time prevailed in that church; many of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of them &s;prung up in the darke&s;t and mo&s;t barbarous ages of chri&s;tianity, when learning degene|rated into fabulous legends and monki&s;h &s;tories, when to under&s;tand Greek, and other languages, was &s;u&s;|pected, and to believe the Antipodes was e&s;teemed here&s;y; then was the time to impo&s;e on an undi&s;cerning age, and to obtrude upon their under&s;tanding the belief of miracles performed by the relics of departed &s;aints, and many doctrines, &s;uch as purgatory, tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation, &amp;c. which are not only un&s;criptural, but repugnant both to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>In the two la&s;t centuries the increa&s;e of knowledge, hath produced various effects among per&s;ons of different ranks: tho&s;e, who&s;e intere&s;t or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions have not rendered them the friends and abettors of papal au|thority, and impo&s;itions on the con&s;ciences of men un|der various preten&s;ions, and have &s;een the incon&s;i&s;tency of many of their doctrines, practices, and ceremonies, with genuine Chri&s;tianity, have paid only an external regard to their ceremonies, to avoid eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil penalties: &s;ome have looked with indifference on all the outward forms and modes of religion, whil&s;t many have fallen into direct infidelity; and dei&s;m is now too general among the politer part of the inhabitants both in Italy and France.</P>

<P>The common law, that obtained throughout the We&s;t till the twelfth century, was the collection of canons made by Diony&s;ius Exiguus in 520; the capitularies of Charlemaign, and the decrees of the popes from Sircius

<P>Indeed, between the eighth and eleventh centuries, the canon law was mixed and confounded with the papal decrees from St. Clement to Sircius, which till then had been unknown: this gave occa&s;ion to a new reform or body of the canon law, which is the collection &s;till ex|tant under the title of the Concordance of the Di&s;carding Canons, made in 1151, by Gratian, a Benedictine monk, from texts of &s;cripture, councils, and &s;entiments of the fathers in the &s;everal points of eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity. This work he divided according to the order of matters, not of times and councils, as had been done before; &s;o that, upon the appearance of this, all the ancient col|lections immediately &s;unk.&mdash;It is divided into three parts; the fir&s;t into an hundred and eight di&s;tinctions; the &s;econd into thirty-&s;ix cau&s;es, and the third into five di&s;tinct parts: the &s;econd part of the canon law con&s;i&s;ts of the decrees of the popes from 1150, to pope Grego|ry IX. in 1229.</P>
<P>In 1297, pope Boniface continued the papal decrees as far as his time: this part the French make particular exception to, by rea&s;on of that pope's differences with their king, Philip the Fair. To the&s;e pope John XXII. added the Clementines, or the five books of the con&s;ti|tutions of his predece&s;&s;or Clement V.

<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws and canons, which are the bulwark of the con&s;titution of the Romi&s;h church, there are other in&s;titutions of that church more e&s;pe|cially calculated for pre&s;erving an uniformity of faith among Chri&s;tians.

<P>The creed it&s;elf contains the &s;ub&s;tance of the decrees and canons of the council of Trent, and being u&s;ually divided into twenty-four articles, is &s;o plau&s;ible as to ex|pre&s;s the fir&s;t twelve in the very words of that creed called the Nicene, the greate&s;t part of which mo&s;t pro|re&s;tants profe&s;s to believe and acknowledge: but there is this great difference, as was before ob&s;erved, between the manner wherein the Nicene creed is impo&s;ed in popi&s;h countries, and wherein they, who adhere to true prote&s;tant principles, receive it, or any part of it; that the one require it to be received upon an equal footing with the holy &s;criptures; the other believe and acknow|ledge the things contained in it, not becau&s;e the fathers of the Nicene council &s;o believed and &s;o decreed; but becau&s;e they apprehend, that the things them&s;elves are contained in the holy &s;criptures, and &s;o far only as they are therein contained; &s;o that their faith is ultimately re&s;olved into the word of God, and not into the commandments of men: herein they a&s;&s;ert their liberty as becomes prote&s;|tants

<P>This bull (as they call it) bears date on the ides of November 1564, and concludes in the u&s;ual manner, with threats of the indignation of God, and of his ble&s;&s;|ed apo&s;tles St. Peter and St. Paul, again&s;t all that in|fringe or oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>And every reader, I &s;uppo&s;e, di&s;cerns, that this is not merely a confe&s;&s;ion of faith, but likewi&s;e a &s;olemn oath; and &s;o the title of it bears, <HI>A bull concerning the form of an oath of profe&s;&s;ion of faith;</HI> which faith all eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons, whether &s;ecular or regular, as they di&s;tingui&s;h them, and all military orders, are obliged to take&mdash;As follows: "This true catholic faith, without which no one can be &s;aved, which at this pre&s;ent time I do, of my own ac|cord, profe&s;s, and &s;incerely hold, I, the &s;ame N.

For when the&s;e fathers met at Trent, and were to make a profe&s;&s;ion of faith by rehear&s;ing the creed, which the Roman church u&s;es,
<PB N="165" REF="304">&s;o the words are

<P>Though this creed is a&s;&s;erted to be the true catholic faith, it is in no &s;en&s;e catholic, as to place, nor time; for it was no where u&s;ed till they made it, no not there, nor is now every where believed, and was not, in the addi|tional articles to the Nicene creed, believed in any church for above 1500 years; nor now u&s;ed in that church it&s;elf, when they admit members into the catholic church by bapti&s;m; but they are &s;aid to be put into a &s;tate of &s;alvation, by their profe&s;&s;ing to believe the Nicene creed alone: which is a direct contradiction to the terms of this creed, wherein are included the doctrines of tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation, wor&s;hipping images, the &s;even &s;acra|ments, traditions, and other con&s;titutions of the Romi&s;h church, there declared to be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation

<P>The following judicious reflections on pope Pius's creed, by the Rev. Mr. Burroughs, may not be unac|ceptable to our readers. "Let any man, who has ever read the New Te&s;tament, judge what likene&s;s there is, between the doctrine of pope Pius's creed, and that which was taught by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and his apo&s;tles, Nay, let any man of &s;ober thought, whether he has read the &s;criptures or not, judge whether it is po&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch a religion &s;hould ever come from God, as that which the church of Rome tells you is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;al|vation.</P>
<P>The doctrine of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles teaches us the highe&s;t veneration of the one living and true God, the wi&s;e and righteous and gracious governor of the world, and the mo&s;t ardent affection to him as our be&s;t friend and benefactor: and directs and encourages us to &s;eek of him, with a full a&s;&s;urance of faith, every needful ble&s;&s;ing, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only media|tor between God and men. It requires of us righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and equity in our whole conduct towards tho&s;e with whom we have to do; and very particularly re|commends a mutual forbearance and affectionate ten|derne&s;s among Chri&s;tian brethren, with regard to the mi&s;apprehen&s;ions and mi&s;takes into which they may fall. And, as any religion mu&s;t do which comes from God, it lays a very great &s;tre&s;s upon a &s;ober, temperate cour&s;e
<PB N="169" REF="308">of life; excluding from the kingdom of heaven tho&s;e who allow them&s;elves in the contrary cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But in the preceding papers we have &s;een, that the religion of the church of Rome oppo&s;es that of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in all the&s;e re&s;pects, though it pre|tends in every one of them to adhere to it. The papi&s;ts profe&s;s indeed to acknowledge one only living and true God: yet at the &s;ame time it is notorious, that they pay more real wor&s;hip and adoration to angels and &s;aints, and even to images, than to him. And to keep up this practice, &s;uch thoughts are &s;ugge&s;ted to the people's minds concerning the divine being, as are altogether un|worthy of him, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the honour of the one and only mediator, in who&s;e name we are directed to addre&s;s him. Nay, the multiplicity of the prayers them&s;elves, which are addre&s;&s;ed to &s;aints and angels, begging for their interce&s;&s;ion, tends to make the people think concerning the kinde&s;t and mo&s;t benevolent being in the world, that he is almo&s;t inexorable, and that no|thing but continual importunity will prevail with him for any favour: whereas the mediation of Chri&s;t, as &s;tated in the New Te&s;tament, teaches no &s;uch thing; but encourages us, &s;inners as we are, to go directly to God in <HI>his</HI> name, <HI>in whom</HI> he has declared him&s;elf to be <HI>well plea&s;ed.</HI> But this one mediator is by the church of Rome overlooked, in a croud of others of her own making.</P>
<P>Then, in&s;tead of a &s;trict regard to righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;obriety, the doctrines of indulgences and purgatory, and &s;o likewi&s;e that of ab&s;olution, upon confe&s;&s;ion and &s;atisfaction at the will and plea&s;ure of the prie&s;t, en|courage all manner of vice and wickedne&s;s: &s;ince, ac|cording to the&s;e doctrines, a man may buy off any pu|ni&s;hment, if he &s;urvives the wicked actions he re&s;olves upon; or, at the wor&s;t, can have them bought off when he is dead, if he has but money enough to leave behind him.</P>
<P>As to forbearance and brotherly kindne&s;s; the church of Rome is a &s;worn enemy to the&s;e Chri&s;tian virtues.
<PB N="170" REF="309">She will not bear the lea&s;t deviation from her own tra|ditions, decrees, and canons.

<P>What good preten&s;ions the church of Rome has to be the church of Chri&s;t, &s;he &s;hews by &s;etting up ano|ther head over the church be&s;ides Chri&s;t, incon&s;i&s;tently with his legi&s;lative authority, and contrary to his own expre&s;s direction.</P>
<P>How little value &s;he has for the &s;cripture, &s;he &s;hews by &s;etting up her own traditions upon an equal footing with it.

<P>How de&s;tructive to all the views of true religion is the &s;tre&s;s which popery lays upon external &s;ervices, to the neglect of what is inward and pertaining to the con&s;cience; and how fatally this tends to harden men in their &s;ins, and to make them re&s;olve again&s;t the irk|&s;ome work of &s;ubduing ill habits, and labouring after tho&s;e which are truly good; is too vi&s;ible to need a de|mon&s;tration.</P>

The mo&s;t remarkable piece of this kind is entitled, "A Vindi|cation of the Roman Catholics," being a mo&s;t &s;olemn declaration of their utter abhorrence of the following tenets, vulgarly laid at their door, printed at London at the beginning of king James's reign, and reprinted in 1743, when an inva&s;ion was de&s;igned again&s;t England by the pretender. It was calculated to introduce po|pery, by making it appear, that popery was not that horrid antichri&s;tian thing, but in its own nature mild and gentle, and as fair as truth it&s;elf. The author, and the pre&s;ent editor, &s;ay, that if the en&s;uing cur&s;es be added to tho&s;e appointed to be read on the fir&s;t day of Lent, "they will &s;eriou&s;ly and heartily an&s;wer <HI>Amen</HI> to them all."</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that commits idolatry, that prays to images or relicks, or wor&s;hips them for gods.</HI></P>
<P>Re&s;p. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the readine&s;s of the Roman catho|lics to oblige them&s;elves to an&s;wer <HI>Amen</HI> to this cur&s;e, yet it may be worth enquiring how far they are guilty
<PB N="172" REF="311">of this crime. Idolatry con&s;i&s;ts in the acknowledge|ment of authority and dominion in &s;ome invi&s;ible being or beings over us, which they have not. If this be attributed to &s;aints and angels, it is idolatry.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Cur&s;ed is every godde&s;s wor&s;hipper, that believes the Virgin Mary to be any more than a creature; that honours her, wor&s;hips her, or puts his tru&s;t in her as much as in God; that believes her above her Son, or that &s;he can in any thing command him.</HI></P>
<P>Re&s;p. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>You are not charged with believing the Virgin Mary to be more than a creature, nor with wor&s;hipping her, or putting tru&s;t in her, as much as in God, but with wor&s;hipping her. Whether it be more or le&s;s, or as much as God, is not the point; but whether &s;he ought at all to be wor&s;hipped. The papi&s;ts are charged with giving undue honour and wor&s;hip to, and tru&s;t in her; an honour which has not the countenance of one &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age in &s;cripture, much le&s;s command to do it.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that believes the angels or &s;aints in heaven to be his redeemers, that prays to them as &s;uch, or that gives God's honour to them, or to any creature what|ever.</HI></P>
<P>Re&s;p. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>I do not, I would not, charge the papi&s;ts with be|lieving angels or &s;aints to be their redeemers, nor do I imagine that they pray to them as &s;uch; what they are to be charged with is, praying to &s;aints, praying to beings who are &s;uppo&s;ed ready and able to help them, without any grounds from revelation, without knowing that they have authority over us, without knowing that they can hear us, without knowing that they are per|mitted to help us, or intercede for us.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that wor&s;hips any breaden god, or makes gods of the empty elements of bread and wine.</HI></P>
<P>Re&s;p. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>In this, as in all the other preceding points, there is an equivocation. May we not word the cur&s;e thus&mdash;
<PB N="173" REF="312"><HI>Cur&s;ed is he that wor&s;hips that which before it was con&s;e|crated was bread and wine, and after con&s;ecration &s;eems to all our &s;en&s;es to retain the &s;ub&s;tance of bread and wine?</HI> If this were the ca&s;e, it would be wor&s;hipping a breaden god. What then is the difference between the con|&s;ecrated bread, and the &s;ame bread uncon&s;ecrated?

<P>Re&s;p. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this I ob&s;erve, that our author &s;uppo&s;es that prie&s;ts can forgive &s;ins, if the &s;inner does repent; he &s;uppo&s;es likewi&s;e, that the &s;inner is a believer in Chri&s;t, and that the prie&s;t can forgive &s;uch a &s;inner if he repents: now a prie&s;t that pretends to forgive the &s;ins of a repenting Chri&s;tian, a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf a power or privilege which can never be proved to be given to him. Who can forgive &s;ins but God alone, again&s;t whom they are committed? If therefore any prie&s;ts a&s;|&s;ume to them&s;elves a power over Chri&s;tians to forgive them their &s;ins, they tran&s;gre&s;s the law of Chri&s;t under the cover of his words, which they pervert to u&s;es of their own.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that believes that prie&s;ts can give pre&s;ent ab&s;olution to any per&s;ons for &s;ins they may commit in time to come.</HI></P>

<P>"This cur&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, is added by the editor, that it is an article of the catholic faith, to believe that no power on earth can licence men to lye, for&s;wear, and perjure them&s;elves, to ma&s;&s;acre their neighbours, or de|&s;troy their native country, on pretence of promoting the catholic cau&s;e or religion." But this is far from being clear. Suppo&s;e your neighbour, or tho&s;e of your native country, to be heretics, what is the catholic faith, or catholic practice, in this ca&s;e? Is it not

<P>That the pope pretends to forgive &s;omething for a &s;um of money. is not, I think, di&s;owned; that he in|tends to give leave to commit &s;ins, or that he forgives &s;ins for a &s;um of money, is here denied.

<P>If this be &s;o, then there is no &s;urplus of good works in any of the &s;aints; in con&s;equence, no &s;piritual trea|&s;ure of the church, no works of &s;upererogation; for, if there were, a man might merit &s;alvation by his own good works, and make condign &s;atisfaction for the guilt of his &s;ins; and then the que&s;tion is, How far a man may merit &s;alvation?</P>

<P>This is an eva&s;ive account of the papi&s;ts hiding the &s;criptures from the people. The que&s;tion is, Why are the &s;criptures kept at all from the people? And the an&s;wer is, That they do not keep them for this or that particular purpo&s;e. It may be &s;o; but you may have other purpo&s;es, other ends, other de&s;igns, all bad in them&s;elves, at the &s;ame time that you profe&s;s to hide the &s;criptures from the people, not on de&s;ign to keep them in ignorance.</P>

<P>Re&s;p. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Admit that the papi&s;ts do not de&s;ign to "undervalue the word of God, admit that they do not for&s;ake the &s;cripture, admit too that they do not chu&s;e to follow human traditions rather than it:" yet they may put human traditions upon an equal footing with the &s;criptures: they may join traditions to &s;cripture, and make both to be equally ob&s;erved. The council of Trent did this, when it profe&s;&s;ed to "receive and reverence all the books of both the Old and New Te&s;tament, &s;ince God is the one author of both, and al&s;o traditions, which re|late to either faith or manners, as if they were dictated either by word of mouth, by Chri&s;t, or by the Holy Spirit, and pre&s;erved in a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the ca|tholic church." It received them, I &s;ay, with equal affection of piety and reverence: nay, it pronounced an anathema to all who willingly and wittingly con|temned traditions." Now, if the &s;cripture alone, and by it&s;elf, contains the rule of faith, they who join tra|dition to it to form the rule of faith, undervalues the word of God as not &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to give us the rule of faith; and that equal tradition to the &s;criptures
<PB N="176" REF="315">undervalue the &s;criptures, becau&s;e they treat human traditions ju&s;t with the &s;ame regard as they do the word of God.</P>
<P N="11">XI. <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that leaves the commandments of God to ob&s;erve the con&s;titutions of men.</HI></P>
<P>Re&s;p. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing one were to charge the papi&s;ts, not with ab&s;olute leaving the commandments of God to ob&s;erve the con&s;titutions of men, but with obliging men to ob&s;erve the con&s;titutions of men equally with the com|mandments of God; this would be what they could not di&s;charge them&s;elves from. What are their auricular confe&s;&s;ion, ab&s;olution, penances, but human con&s;titu|tions, not in the word of God? What is made here&s;y by their church, and treated with anathemas, excom|munications, burnings, tortures, and all the &s;evere&s;t penalties that inhuman cruelty could invent, but &s;ome|thing not contained in the word of God, &s;omething that is a mere invention of men? But the fact is, that in many in&s;tances they have left the commandments of God, to ob&s;erve the con&s;titutions of men.</P>
<P N="12">XII. <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that omits any of the Ten Command|ments, or keeps the people from the knowledge of any one of them, to the end they may not have occa&s;ion of di&s;cover|ing the truth.</HI></P>
<P>Re&s;p. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>It is not of any great con&s;equence, I apprehend, how the Ten Commandments are divided, provided that every one of them be inculcated, and the people are taught their full meaning; but yet the u&s;ual di&s;tinc|tion is on many accounts preferable, as the rea&s;on of the prohibition of images is di&s;tinct from the having other gods, and the coveting of our neighbour's hou&s;e, and coveting his wife and goods, are founded upon the &s;ame rea&s;on. The Jews of old under&s;tood the divi&s;ion of the commandments to be as all prote&s;tants have made it, and &s;o Jo&s;ephus has di&s;tingui&s;hed them, Ant. Jud. l. iii. c. iv. and &s;o has Philo; both of them

<P>It &s;hould not have been &s;aid,&mdash;<HI>that</HI> preaches <HI>to the people in an unknown tongue;</HI> but, that <HI>prays</HI> in an unknown tongue in public a&s;&s;emblies. It is well known, that all their public &s;ervices are in a tongue which the people do not under&s;tand: can this tend to edification? Or if the prie&s;t call upon the people to join in certain acts of wor&s;hip, can the people <HI>under|&s;tand</HI> what they are called upon for? They are pre&s;ent at the litanies, and other public acts of devotion, which are all performed in <HI>Latin:</HI> can they join in prayer to God, when they know not what is &s;aid? Is it to be called <HI>prayer,</HI> when neither the <HI>words,</HI> nor the &s;en&s;e, is &s;uch as that the petitioner can know what he prays for? He may indeed be devout, and li&s;t up his heart to God, whil&s;t the prie&s;t reads &s;omething which is not under&s;tood. But the apo&s;tle has ob&s;erved, <HI>If I pray in an</HI> unknown tongue, <HI>my &s;pirit prayeth, but my under|&s;tanding is unfruitful. What is it then? I will</HI> pray <HI>with the &s;pirit, and I will pray with the</HI> under&s;tanding <HI>al&s;o&mdash; El&s;e when thou &s;halt ble&s;s with the &s;pirit, how &s;hall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned &s;ay</HI> Amen <HI>at thy giving of thanks, &s;eeing he under&s;tandeth not what thou &s;aye&s;t?</HI> 1 Cor. xiv. 14, 15, 16. I do not &s;ay, that this is done with <HI>de&s;ign</HI> to, or for this <HI>end,</HI> that they may <HI>keep the people in ignorance:</HI> but it is an <HI>ob&s;urd,</HI> a <HI>&s;en&s;ele&s;s</HI> piece of management, which can an&s;wer no good end.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that believes that the</HI> Pope <HI>can give to any, upon any account what&s;oever, di&s;pen&s;ations to lie, or &s;wear fal&s;ely; or that it is lawful for any at the lo&s;t hour to prote&s;t him&s;elf innocent in ca&s;e he be guilty.</HI> R. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>How far, and to what particular ca&s;es the Pope's <HI>di&s;pen&s;ing power</HI> may extend, or he him&s;elf may apply
<PB N="178" REF="317">it, may be hard to &s;ay. It is certain, that application has been made to him to grant <HI>di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> to many within degrees prohibited by the <HI>Levitical</HI> law, and he has claimed this power. Now, if he may di&s;pen&s;e with one law of God, he may with equal right di&s;pen&s;e with another. He has <HI>di&s;pen&s;ed</HI> with oaths, nay <HI>ab&s;olved</HI> from oaths: and it is an allowed fact, that he has fre|quently put this in execution. And this power has never been taken away, or given up, that I have heard.</P>
<P>It is added, <Q><HI>Cur&s;ed is he that</HI> believes it <HI>lawful for any one, at the</HI> la&s;t <HI>hour, to prote&s;t him&s;elf innocent in ca&s;e he be guilty.</HI></Q> Ay, or at <HI>any</HI> hour. But &s;up|po&s;e a man to be ab&s;olved by a judicial act of prie&s;tly ab&s;olution from <HI>guilt,</HI> can he then be deemed <HI>guilty?</HI> If he be cleared <HI>a culpa &amp; reatu, from &s;au't and guilt,</HI> why may he not prote&s;t him&s;elf innocent? It is true, he can|not do this <HI>if he be guilty;</HI> that is, if he thinks him&s;elf not free from <HI>guilt:</HI> but where the judge has in form pronounced a man <HI>innocent,</HI> and declared all <HI>guilt</HI> to be removed, the offender has a right to prote&s;t him&s;elf <HI>in|nocent,</HI> and he may be weak enough to believe him&s;elf to be &s;o.</P>
<P N="15">XV. <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that</HI> encourages <HI>&s;ins, or teaches men to defer the amendment of their lives, on pre&s;umption of a</HI> death-bed repentance. R. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>The point which &s;hould be made good by <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> is, that their &s;acraments of <HI>ab&s;olution</HI> and <HI>extreme unction</HI> do not naturally tend to <HI>encourage &s;ins,</HI> and lead men to <HI>defer amendment on pre&s;umption of their good effects on a death-bed Ab&s;olution</HI> pronounced in form, as from <HI>the min&s;ters of God,</HI> and a &s;uppo&s;ed power <HI>in every prie&s;t to free every one from all kind of &s;in, when danger of death appears,</HI> cannot but be an <HI>encouragement</HI> to defer amend|ment till the la&s;t hour.</P>
<P>When <HI>extreme unction</HI> is made a &s;acrament, and is to be admini&s;tered on the death-bed, and it is declared to be for the&s;e u&s;es, that it <HI>gives grace which remits &s;ins, and particularly the lighter ones, commonly called</HI>
<PB N="179" REF="318">venial; <HI>that it frees the &s;oul from that weakne&s;s and lan|guor which it has contracted from &s;in, and from the re|mains of &s;in;</HI> that it <HI>admini&s;ters joy and comfort to the &s;ouls of the faithful, and &s;upplies them with arms and &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t the devil, and to break his force.</HI>&mdash;When <HI>ex|treme unction</HI> has all the&s;e good effects, mu&s;t it not na|turally <HI>encourage</HI> men to go on in vice, and to <HI>defer amendment,</HI> when they have &s;o good a &s;heet-anchor at la&s;t? It is not knowing mankind, not to &s;ee this na|tural effect. So that though he is pronounced accur|&s;ed, who <HI>encourages,</HI> that is, exhorts, advi&s;es, or pro|motes de&s;ignedly any &s;in, or that teaches to defer a|mendment of life on pre&s;umption of a death-bed re|pentance; yet if the ordering and general conduct of things is &s;uch as tends naturally to this effect, this may be charged with <HI>encouraging,</HI> what the natural re|&s;ult of it is; and the debate will be only about the propriety of the word <HI>encourage,</HI> which &s;ignifies not only <HI>active exciting, but not ob&s;tructing when you &s;ee the ill effect of an action.</HI></P>
<P N="16">XVI. <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that teaches men that they may be</HI> lawfully drunk <HI>on a Friday, or on any other fa&s;ting-day, though they mu&s;t not ta&s;te the lea&s;t bit of fle&s;h.</HI> R. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>As I never heard of any body that pretended to teach men that they may be lawfully drunk on any day, I look upon this cur&s;e as a mere fally of zeal: it is enough to remark, that the eating any fle&s;h is for|bidden <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> by the church; the drinking wine is not &s;o, upon their fa&s;ting days. The thing I would recommend to the con&s;ideration of all Papi&s;ts is, their departure from &s;cripture. Why do they command ab&s;tinence from <HI>fle&s;h</HI> on &s;o many days in every week? Why ab&s;tain from <HI>meats,</HI> which <HI>God hath ordained to be received by all with thank&s;giving?</HI> Why is &s;uch a fa&s;t en|joined, as may be kept with drinking of <HI>wine,</HI> and other even <HI>&s;tronger liquors?</HI> I do not charge them with allowing exce&s;&s;es in liquors, but with enjoining to many fa&s;t and meagre days, on a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> not <HI>me|dicinal</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="319">account, and this without authority from Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles, nay in direct compliance with that mark that is mentioned as a &s;ign of an apo&s;tacy from the faith.</P>

<P>Here again is a &s;ad in&s;tance of chicane. Nobody, I believe, charges the Papi&s;ts with <HI>placing religion</HI> in nothing but <HI>pompous &s;hew:</HI> but they are charged with cumbering religion with numerous rites and ceremo|nies, with proce&s;&s;ions, pilgrimages, and all the evils ari&s;ing from &s;uch &s;orts of follies. The doctrines and practices of the go&s;pel are plain, &s;imple, ea&s;y things; which yet have been &s;o loaded, &s;o overburdened with ceremonies, that an apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t, were he to ari&s;e and be brought to the bapti&s;m of any per&s;on, would not be able to &s;ay what they were about. Let us &s;up|po&s;e the water con&s;ecrated, the per&s;on &s;tanding at the church-doors forbid to enter into the church, and there cathechized.

<P>It is right to di&s;claim cruelty and bloody-minded|ne&s;s: but if the people are taught, that heretics may be <HI>killed;</HI> if heretics may be delivered over to the &s;e|cular arm and be burnt; and all are heretics who oppo&s;e the rights and privileges of the <HI>Roman</HI> church; if they are repre&s;ented &s;o odious to God and man, that they may be ju&s;tly de&s;troyed; if their de&s;erving the flames be &s;o inculcated, that the people who are &s;pec|tators at an <HI>Auto de Fe,</HI> &s;hall look on the per&s;on con|demned by the holy inqui&s;ition, and &s;ee them carried to the flames without emotion, nay with joy, as if they were murderers or robbers, ju&s;tly condemned, and

<PB N="185" REF="326">the&s;e words: "We forbid that laymen be permitted to have the books of the Old and New Te&s;tament, unle&s;s &s;ome one out of devotion de&s;ire to have the p&s;alter or breviary for divine offices, and the hours of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin Mary; but even tho&s;e now men|tioned, they may not have tran&s;lated in the vulgar tongue

The &s;pecial occa&s;ion of this decree, was the preaching of the Walden&s;es, who taught, that, in articles of faith, the holy &s;criptures were the rule by which men were to judge; that what&s;oever was not agreeable to the word of God ought to be rejected; that the reading and knowledge of the &s;criptures was free and nece&s;&s;ary to all men, both laity and clergy. But when the church of Rome had got a variety of new articles of faith as would not abide the old te&s;t, it was prudently done to deprive the people of the &s;crip|tures, that they might not be able to di&s;cover the errors into which they led them

<HEAD>Of Indulgences.</HEAD>
<P>Indulgences are the &s;ure&s;t touch&s;tones which his ho|line&s;s makes u&s;e of to try the faith of true believers. A va&s;t number of devotees imagine that they infal|libly &s;ecure the attainment of paradi&s;e. The origin of the&s;e means, this &s;alutary in&s;titution, which has &s;ince degenerated into an abu&s;e, &s;eems particularly hinted at in a pa&s;&s;age of St. Cyprian: but be that as it will, the relea&s;e from torments was not known till a long time after by the name of indulgence. It was com|mon enough indeed in the &s;eventh and eighth centu|ries. Pope Sergius, in the 884, gave three forty days indulgences at once to &s;uch as &s;hould vi&s;it the church of St. Martin on the Hills, on the fe&s;tival peculiarly devoted to the &s;ervice of that &s;aint.</P>
<P>If the term <HI>Indulgence</HI> be defined, we mean a re|mi&s;&s;ion from temporal pains, which are due to actual &s;ins. It will be comprehended with ea&s;e, that acce&s;s to heaven is not therefore the freer to &s;uch devotees as have obtained it, unle&s;s by acts of virtue they concur to make it effectual; and yet every one is con&s;cious of the exce&s;&s;ive power a&s;cribed to indulgences, and of the va&s;t &s;ervices they have done to avarice, mi&s;guided zeal, and ambition. No one however ought to ima|gine, that our intent is to overthrow the real advan|tages of them by this expre&s;&s;ion; for we are no &s;tran|gers to the miracles wrought by St. Bernard, who,
<PB N="188" REF="329">whil&s;t he was preaching up the indulgences of Pope Eugenius III. inflamed the hearts of the believers of his age at once with a &s;pirit of war and contrition, and &s;hewed the atonement of their crimes, and the remi&s;|&s;ion of their torments, annexed to tho&s;e cro&s;&s;es and &s;words wherewith he per&s;uaded them to arm them|&s;elves again&s;t the infidels. We are very &s;en&s;ible like|wi&s;e, that St. Bridget declares, in her revelations, the vi&s;ion &s;he had of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who informed her, "That the mo&s;t infallible way to atone for all &s;ins, was to procure indulgences; that with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, whenever he was inclined to treat any &s;oul with tenderne&s;s and affection, he would advi&s;e it to re|&s;ide con&s;tantly at Rome, there being no place in the world where &s;o many indulgences could be procured." To this we might add, that there is no city more commodious than this for devotees, who would turn their piety towards this object. The Ba&s;ilicas have indulgences for every day in the year, and on fe&s;tivals they are redoubled.</P>

The oath of allegiance is only an acknowledge|ment of the King to be rightful and lawful King of this kingdom, and that the Pope has no power or au|thority to depo&s;e him; and that the per&s;on who takes &s;uch oath will continue to bear faith and true allegiance to him, notwith&s;tanding any declaration of excommu|nication made or granted by the Pope.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See the ca&s;e of Archpre&s;byter Blackwell, who was here in England in King James I.'s time, who was committed to pri&s;on, and obtained his liberty by taking the oath of allegiance; and the con&s;equence was, that he was removed from his office for taking of it, and one Birchett put in his place.</P>

<P>Now the Papi&s;ts have gone on ever &s;ince in this re|fu&s;al to take the oath of allegiance, and for that rea|&s;on they ought to be treated as enemies to the govern|ment.</P>
<P N="5">V. Protection and allegiance, in all &s;tates, in all governments, are reciprocal. The rea&s;on of men's entering into &s;ociety is, by uniting &s;trength, to &s;ecure them&s;elves, &s;ince otherwi&s;e they might be too weak to re&s;i&s;t the attacks of tho&s;e that might invade them: every particular private man therefore is protected by the &s;trength of the whole, and every one that claims the advantage of this &s;ecurity, is under obligation to join with the &s;ociety again&s;t its enemies. Hence it is, that all governors have a right to demand te&s;ts of alle|giance from the people; and all tho&s;e who refu&s;e to give them, when called upon, in effect, declare them|&s;elves enemies of that &s;ociety. When therefore Papi&s;ts refu&s;e the te&s;t of allegiance, they have a right to be refu&s;ed protection. Nor have they any rea&s;on to com|plain of inju&s;tice, hard&s;hip, oppre&s;&s;ion, or by what|ever name they may call the execution of the laws of this land; &s;ince an enemy of any &s;ociety is by the law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation to be guarded again&s;t, and enemies are not to be treated as friends.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Imagine that the legi&s;lative power in any &s;ocie|ty has fixed the per&s;on who &s;hall govern them on the throne; now, if the community con&s;ents to, and ap|proves of, and readily gives the te&s;t of their obedi|ence
<PB N="194" REF="337">and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the per&s;on fixed by the legi&s;la|ture, and any &s;ect, or the men of any profe&s;&s;ion, who refu&s;e to take the u&s;ual oath for the proof of their al|legiance, is it not natural for the government under which they live, to have a jealous eye over them, to guard again&s;t the increa&s;e of their &s;trength, to ob&s;erve whether they tamper with the people to corrupt them, to enquire who they are that endeavour to make con|verts to &s;uch an oppo&s;ition, and to inflict &s;ome puni&s;h|ment on &s;uch as mi&s;behave them&s;elves in &s;uch man|ner? Now, if any convert to Popery is made an enemy by principle to our government, the government is thereby in proportion &s;o much weakened.</P>
<P>When therefore our editor tells us, "unanimity can never be expected, unle&s;s all the <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> are equally protected,"&mdash;he &s;hould have &s;aid,&mdash;"unle&s;s <HI>friends</HI> and enemies are equally protected,"&mdash;and then he had &s;poke what he wanted to be done. But are &s;uch as refu&s;e the common te&s;ts of friend&s;hip, to be equally protected with tho&s;e that are friends?&mdash;The word <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> indeed, is a good term, that comprehends all who live under any government, be they what they will, friends or not friends; and if they behave them&s;elves as good &s;ubjects, &s;hould have a right to protection. But while they acknowledge a &s;upremacy in a foreign per&s;on, and an ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him, and own a depen|dance &s;o much upon his power, as not to think it law|ful to &s;ubmit to our laws, but &s;o far only as that fo|reign power permits, who, as their governor, pronounce it unlawful to take the oath of allegiance to our King; they cannot ju&s;tly be looked upon as a &s;ect that ought to be indulged as good friends and good &s;ubjects; but as profe&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects of a foreign power, and an ene|my to that &s;tate under which they have long enjoyed peace and quiet

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Limborch's Hi&s;t. of the Inqui&s;ition, p. 318.</NOTE>, glory that the inqui&s;ition is the mo&s;t certain remedy to extirpate here&s;ies; e&s;pecially, <HI>Ludovicus &agrave; Paramo</HI>
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. II. 3.4, 5.</NOTE>, takes a great deal of pains to &s;how that here&s;ies have, in &s;everal places, been extingui&s;hed by the help of the inqui&s;ition, and at la&s;t concludes in the&s;e words: "The&s;e are &s;ome of the faire&s;t fruits, which the mo&s;t fertile field of the holy office hath produced to the church in all kingdoms, where it hath not been ob&s;tructed. But among&s;t all provinces and countries, the kingdoms of Spain do every day receive the noble&s;t &s;ruits; for as in the&s;e countries the holy office of the inqui&s;ition is maintained with greater &s;everity, and is in greater honour and e&s;teem with the nobles and princes, &s;o
<PB N="204" REF="347">it flouri&s;hes in greater authority and power, whereby the judges of the earth carry on more diligent inqui|&s;ition again&s;t here&s;ies, and more effectually pull them up by the very roots." And becau&s;e the inqui&s;ition is &s;o effectual a method to extirpate here&s;ies, he gathers from thence, that it was ordained for this purpo&s;e by the mo&s;t wi&s;e providence of God. But what is really unju&s;t in it&s;elf, and carried on by unju&s;t methods, cannot have God for its author. Nor is &s;ucce&s;s any argument that the inqui&s;ition is from God; the fir&s;t inquiry is, whether it be &s;uitable to the na|ture of the Chri&s;tian doctrine? If it be not, 'tis then unju&s;t and antichri&s;tian; many things are un|righteou&s;ly undertaken by men, and accompli&s;hed by violence and cruelty, by which innocence is oppre&s;&s;ed, which although God, in his ju&s;t and wi&s;e coun&s;el permits, he is far from approving. Even in Japan, a cruel per&s;ecution hath extingui&s;hed the Chri&s;tian religion, as preached by the Roman prie&s;ts, &s;o that the Roman Catholic religion is equally extingui&s;hed there, by the violence of per&s;ecution, as the&s;e doc|trines are in Spain, which are contrary to the church of Rome, and which they render odious by the infa|mous name of here&s;y; and yet they will not allow that any ju&s;t argument can be drawn from hence to prove, that that per&s;ecution was directed by the Divine Pro|vidence, as a mo&s;t effectual remedy for the extirpation of their religion. If other parties of Chri&s;tians would u&s;e the &s;ame diligence and cruelty of inqui&s;ition again&s;t them, I may venture to affirm, that they them&s;elves could not with&s;tand it; but that, within a few years, the Popi&s;h religion would be extingui&s;hed in all Pro|te&s;tant countries, and &s;carce a &s;ingle per&s;on left who would dare to profe&s;s it. But God forbid that the Chri&s;tian religion &s;hould ever be propagated this way, which does not con&s;i&s;t in a feigned and hypocritical profe&s;&s;ion, but in a &s;incere and undi&s;&s;embled faith. And therefore, as no one ought to a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf
<PB N="205" REF="348">the power of judging concerning it but God, the &s;earcher of hearts, to him only let us leave it to pa&s;s the true judgment concerning every man's belief. Let us in the mean while dete&s;t the tyranny of the Papi&s;ts, and &s;trive to reduce tho&s;e who in our judgment hold errors in the way of truth, by the good o&s;&s;ices of cha|rity and benevolence, without arrogating to our&s;elves a judgment over the con&s;ciences of others. And, out of a &s;erious regard to the la&s;t great day of judgment, let us approve our con&s;ciences to God, and every one of us, expecting from his mercy an equitable and righteous judgment, pray without cea&s;ing, ARISE, O LORD, AND JUDGE THY CAUSE.</P>

<P>This device is &s;aid to be fir&s;t hatched by that &s;uper|&s;titious hermit named Peter of Picardy.</P>
<P>Pope Urban very opportunely made u&s;e of for his advantage, and under the pretence of &s;ympathi&s;ing with the unhappy Chri&s;tians at Jeru&s;alem, rai&s;ed an ar|my to favour the purpo&s;es of dominion and authority, and, in a long harangue in a general council of the we&s;t, at Cleremont, in the year 1095, he concluded his oration in the following words: "We therefore relea&s;e all faithful Chri&s;tians that &s;hall bear arms again&s;t heretics and infidels of great and wonderful penance for their &s;ins, and receive them under the de|fence of the church, and the protection of St. Peter and St. Paul.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the particular de&s;igns of Urban in this ex|pedition, it frequently was made to &s;erve other pur|po&s;es, as their ambition or their re&s;entment inclined them, as we find they were afterwards again&s;t the Albigen&s;es or Walden&s;es.</P>
<P>Here it may be very proper to &s;peak a little of the per&s;ecutions carried on again&s;t the Albigen&s;es or Wal|den&s;es, their principles being the &s;ame, the former
<PB N="206" REF="349">name being given them from their inhabiting the town Albigium; the latter as having embraced the principles in general of <HI>Peter Waldo;</HI> and this is am|ply confirmed by the Popes proce&s;&s;es, and &s;entence again&s;t them, it being always in the name of Wal|den&s;es.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;ecution was rai&s;ed again&s;t them by Pope Innocent III. about the year 1198, who pre|tended at fir&s;t to reduce them by rea&s;on and argument, and for that purpo&s;e &s;ent two men among&s;t them, who found them &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed in their principles, that they offered a free and public di&s;putation. In the mean time Pope Innocent &s;trengthened him&s;elf, and pre|pared to de&s;troy or conquer them. Upon this footing the Pope likewi&s;e &s;ent out his &s;piritual thunder-bolts, or anathemas, and in the &s;ame or following year erected the inqui&s;ition; an office peculiarly intended for the finding out and puni&s;hing &s;uch as they plea&s;ed to call heretics, in which monks were principally em|ployed, and chiefly they of the order of St. Dominic, in&s;tituted by the Pope; and by the&s;e means, together with the invitations and promi&s;es given by the Popes bulls of full pardon of &s;in and paradi&s;e to all that would come and bear arms again&s;t them for forty days; &s;o that the army increa&s;ed to near 100,000

<P>The &s;ervice con&s;i&s;ts of prayers and holy le&s;&s;ons, which the church has appointed to be read every day by the clergy at particular hours. This &s;ervice is called by the church the canonical hours; becau&s;e it was or|dained by the canons of the church, which not only pre&s;cribed the hours in which it is to be &s;aid, but like|wi&s;e the particular circum&s;tances in which it is to be &s;aid. This office is in general called the <HI>breviary,</HI> which has its name from being an abridgment of a longer &s;ervice, that was formerly u&s;ed, than is at pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>This office is to be &s;aid in a &s;tanding po&s;ture, pur|&s;uant to the ancient cu&s;tom of the church, and upon the knees on the days of penance.</P>
<P>The office con&s;i&s;ts of &s;even hours, if mattins and lauds are to be reckoned one, but eight in ca&s;e they are di|vided.

The hour of &s;aying prime, is directly after &s;un-ri&s;ing, tierce is fixed to the third hour of the day, &s;exte at the &s;ixth, none at the ninth hour, ve&s;pers towards the evening, and compline after &s;un-&s;et; and due care is

<P N="2">II. Before he begins ma&s;s, he &s;ays a preparatory prayer. The prie&s;t is then to look on him&s;elf as one abandoned of God, and driven out of paradi&s;e for the &s;in of Adam.</P>
<P N="3">III. The prie&s;t makes confe&s;&s;ion for him&s;elf, and for the people, in which it is required that he be free from mortal and from venial &s;in.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The prie&s;t ki&s;&s;es the altar, as a token of our reconciliation with God, and our Lord's being be|trayed by a ki&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">V. The prie&s;t goes to the epi&s;tle &s;ide of the altar, and thurifies or perfumes it. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is now &s;uppo&s;ed to be taken and bound.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The <HI>Introite,</HI> &s;aid or &s;ung, <HI>i. e.</HI> a p&s;alm or hymn, applicable to the circum&s;tance of our Lord's being carried before Caiaphas the high-prie&s;t.</P>

<P N="8">VIII. The prie&s;t turning towards the altar, &s;ays, <HI>Dominus vobi&s;cum,</HI> i. e. The Lord be with you: the people return this &s;alutation, <HI>cum Spiritu tuo,</HI> and with thy Spirit, Je&s;us Chri&s;t looking at Peter.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The prie&s;t reads the epi&s;tle relating to Je&s;us being accu&s;ed before Pilate.</P>
<P N="10">X. The prie&s;t bowing before the altar, &s;ays, <HI>Mun|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cor,</HI> i. e. Clean&s;e our hearts. The gradual is &s;ung. This p&s;alm is varied according as it is the time of Lent or not. The devotion is now directed to our Saviour's being accu&s;ed before Herod, and making no reply.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="211" REF="356">XI. The prie&s;t reads the go&s;pel wherein Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;ent from Herod to Pilate. The go&s;pel is carried from the right &s;ide of the altar to the left, to denote the tender of the go&s;pel to the Gentiles after refu&s;al by the Jews.</P>

<P N="13">XIII. The oblation of the ho&s;t, the creed is &s;ung by the congregation. The prie&s;t then ki&s;&s;es the altar, then the prie&s;t offers up the ho&s;t, which is to repre|&s;ent or import the &s;courging of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which was introductory to his other &s;ufferings.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. The prie&s;t elevates the chalice, then covers it. Here Je&s;us's being crowned with thorns is thereby figured to the mind, &s;hewing that he was going to be elevated a victim; and it is well known the vic|tims of the Pagans were crowned before they were &s;acrificed to their idols.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The prie&s;t wa&s;hes his fingers, as Pilate wa&s;hed his hands, declares Je&s;us innocent, ble&s;&s;es the bread and the wine, ble&s;&s;es the frankincen&s;e, and perfumes the bread and wine, praying that the &s;mell of this &s;acrifice may be more acceptable to him than the &s;moke of victims.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The prie&s;t turning to the people, &s;ays, <HI>Oratre Fratres,</HI> i. e. let us pray. He then bows him|&s;elf to the altar, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the Trinity, and prays in a very low voice. This is one of the &s;ecretums of the ma&s;s, and the imagination of the devout Chri&s;tian is to find out the conformity between this and Chri&s;t being cloathed with a purple robe; but we &s;hall be cautious of adding more on this head, that we may not lo&s;e our&s;elves in the boundle&s;s ocean of allu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The prie&s;t &s;ays the preface at the clo&s;e of the <HI>Secretum.</HI> This part of the ma&s;s is in affinity to Je&s;us Chri&s;t being condemned to be crucified. The prie&s;t u&s;es a prayer to God the Father, which is

<P N="19">XIX. The prie&s;t covers with a cloth the ho&s;t and chalice, St. Veronica offering her handkerchief to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="20">XX. The prie&s;t makes the &s;ign of the cro&s;s upon the ho&s;t and chalice, to &s;ignify that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is nailed to the cro&s;s.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. The prie&s;t adores the ho&s;t before elevated, and then he rai&s;es it up, in the be&s;t manner, to repre|&s;ent our Saviour lifted up upon the cro&s;s. He re|peats the Lord's prayer, with his arms extended, that his body might repre&s;ent the figure of a cro&s;s, which is the en&s;ign of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. The prie&s;t likewi&s;e con&s;ecrates the chalice, and elevates it, to repre&s;ent the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hed upon the cro&s;s.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. The prie&s;t &s;ays the <HI>Memento</HI> for the faith|ful that are in purgatory. This prayer is in allu&s;ion to that which our Lord made for his enemies; but this allu&s;ion would be forced and unnatural, unle&s;s the devotees looked upon them&s;elves as his enemies.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. The prie&s;t then rai&s;es his voice, &s;miting his brea&s;t, begs God's ble&s;&s;ing on him&s;elf and congre|gation, for the &s;ake of &s;uch &s;aints as he enumerates, and implores the divine Maje&s;ty for a place in para|di&s;e, to imitate the thief upon the cro&s;s.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. The prie&s;t elevates the ho&s;t and cup, and &s;ays the <HI>per omnia.</HI> then the Lord's prayer The &s;ign of the cro&s;s, which he makes on the ho&s;t, the chalice, and the altar, is to repre&s;ent to God that bleeding &s;acrifice which his &s;on offered up to him of him&s;elf; then the devout Chri&s;tian becomes the
<PB N="213" REF="358">child of God, and is in allu&s;ion to the virgin Mary's being bid to look on St. John as her &s;on.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. After the Lord's prayer, the prie&s;t &s;ays a private one to God, to procure his peace by the mediation of the Virgin Mary and the &s;aints, then puts the &s;acred ho&s;t upon the paten, and breaks it, to repre&s;ent Je&s;us Chri&s;t giving up the gho&s;t.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. The prie&s;t puts a little bit of the ho&s;t into the chalice. The true Chri&s;tian is now with an eye of faith to behold Je&s;us Chri&s;t de&s;cending into <HI>Limbo,</HI> i. e. hell.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. Then the prie&s;t &s;ays, and the people &s;ing, <HI>Agnus Dei,</HI> &amp;c. thrice over, and the prie&s;t &s;mites his brea&s;t. This action is an allu&s;ion to tho&s;e who, having &s;een our Lord's &s;ufferings, returned home &s;miting their brea&s;ts.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. After the <HI>Agnus Dei</HI> is &s;ung, the prie&s;t &s;ays a private prayer for the peace of the church. He then ki&s;&s;es the altar, and the in&s;trument of peace called the paxis, which being received at his hands by the deacon, it is handed about to the people to be ki&s;&s;ed, and pa&s;&s;ed from each other with the&s;e words, <HI>peace be with you;</HI> and whil&s;t the paxis is ki&s;&s;ing, the prie&s;t prepares him&s;elf for the communion by two other prayers, when he adores the ho&s;t, and then &s;ays with a low voice, <HI>I will eat of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cele&s;tial bread;</HI> and &s;miting his brea&s;t, &s;ays, <HI>I am not worthy that thou &s;houlde&s;t enter into my hou&s;e,</HI> three times after eating of the bread. He uncovers the chalice, repeating ver&s;. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. of the 115th p&s;alm according to the Vulgate. When the prie&s;t has received the communion, he admini&s;|ters it to the people. The application of the&s;e ce|remonies is to the death and burial of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his de&s;cent into hell.</P>

But, &s;ays he, was any man ever &s;o mad as to take that which he feeds upon for a God?

<P>The &s;ubdeacon goes to a little clo&s;et contiguous to the altar, and takes from thence the epi&s;copal &s;andals and &s;tockings, which he elevates and pre&s;ents to the bi&s;hop.

Two acolites, after they have wa&s;hed their hands, take the &s;acred habili|ments, holds them up, and gives them to the two dea|con a&s;&s;i&s;tants, to put upon the bi&s;hop as &s;oon as he has wa&s;hed his hands.

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Apion's Account, in his Tableau de la Cour de Rome, and Picart's Cer. vol. I. p. 339.</NOTE>. A pontifical &s;olemn ma&s;s prin|cipally differs in two re&s;pects, always ob&s;erved, when his holine&s;s him&s;elf officiates. The fir&s;t is this, the two go&s;pels are &s;ung, one in Greek, and the other in Latin; the &s;econd, that the communion is different in the pa|pal ma&s;s, and performed after the following manner: after the <HI>Agnus Dei</HI> is &s;ung, his holine&s;s goes to his throne; the cardinal deacon of the go&s;pel &s;tands in &s;uch a manner on the epi&s;tle &s;ide, with his hands clo|&s;ed
<PB N="219" REF="364">together, that he cannot only &s;ee the &s;acrament on the altar, but the Pope likewi&s;e going to his throne.

After that he gives it to the &s;ub|deacon, who carries it to his holine&s;s; in the mean time, the &s;ame deacon takes the chalice, in which is the con&s;ecrated wine, and having elevated it three times as he did the water before, carries it to the Pope, who adore Je&s;us Chri&s;t under both kinds, as &s;oon as they are brought to him, which he performs with a mode|rately low bow of half his body in a &s;tanding po&s;ture; and when the deacon and &s;ub deacon are come clo&s;e to him, they place them&s;elves one on his right hand, and the other on his left hand; his holine&s;s takes the large ho&s;t which is upon the paten, and communicates, putting it into his mouth: he then gives two &s;mall ones to the deacon and &s;ubdeacon, who are kneeling, and ki&s;&s;es his hand before they receive them. The deacon how|ever &s;till holds the chalice, till the a&s;&s;i&s;tant cardinal bi&s;hop, dre&s;&s;ed in his cope, comes up to the pontifical throne, when the Pope's ve&s;try-keeper pre&s;ents him with a &s;mall gold Pope, one end whereof he dips into the chalice, and his holine&s;s at the &s;ame time takes hold of the other, and inclining his head a little, &s;ucks up a part of the con&s;ecrated wine, leaving the re&s;t to the deacon, who carries the chalice to the altar, and there &s;ucks up a part of it, and leaves a little for the &s;ubdeacon, who drinks it without the Pipe, as al&s;o that which is poured out for the ablution of the cha|lice, which he wipes with the purificatory, or white linen cloth: in the mean time his holine&s;s gives the ki&s;s of peace only to the deacon, and the commu|nion only under one kind to the other cardinals, amba&s;&s;adors, princes, prelates, and &s;ometimes to pri|vate per&s;ons, who have de&s;ired to receive that mark

<P>The incen&s;e-bearer, and &s;even acolites, each with a wax-taper in his hands, walk before the cro&s;s-bearer, and a clerk of the chamber before the incen&s;e-bearer, who holds a &s;word lifted up, with a cap upon it, which is a repre&s;entation perhaps of the irre&s;i&s;tible power and efficacy of the pontifical &s;word, which Chri&s;t's vicar has inherited from St. Paul, with that of freeing Chri&s;tians from the bondage of the devil, by a right acquired by the &s;on of God, who&s;e nativity is then ce|lebrated. It is con&s;idered likewi&s;e as an emblem of the church's dignity and freedom under the govern|ment of the Pope. Many of the &s;uperior clergy make up this holy proce&s;&s;ion; and &s;hould the Emperor, or any other &s;overeign prince, happen to be at Rome at that time, he mu&s;t carry the train of the Pope's man|tle; two cardinals likewi&s;e hold up the two ends of it.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why do Catholics &s;o often repeat the <HI>Hail, Mary?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To commemorate the incarnation of the Son of God; to honour his ble&s;&s;ed mother, and to de&s;ire her prayers.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="370"><HI>Q.</HI> What is the meaning of the <HI>Beads?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is a devotion, con&s;i&s;ting of a certain number of <HI>our father</HI> and <HI>hail Maries,</HI> directed for the obtain|ing of ble&s;&s;ings from God, through the prayers and interce&s;&s;ion of our Lady.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But is it not highly ab&s;urd, that, according to the common way of laying the beads, there are re|peated ten <HI>hail Maries</HI> for one <HI>our father?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It would be ab&s;urd indeed, and bla&s;phemous too, if the meaning of this were to &s;ignify that the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin is either more powerful or more merciful than her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, or that we have a greater confidence in her than in him; but we are &s;ar from any &s;uch notions.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why then is the <HI>hail Mary</HI> repeated &s;o much oftener in the beads than the Lord's prayer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Becau&s;e the beads being a devotion particularly in&s;tituted to commemorate the incarnation of Chri&s;t, and to honour him in his ble&s;&s;ed mother, it was thought proper to repeat &s;o much the oftener that prayer, which is particularly adapted to the&s;e ends. In the mean time, it may be proper &s;o take notice, 1. That if in the beads there be ten <HI>hail Maries</HI> &s;aid for one <HI>our father,</HI> in the ma&s;s and office of the church, almo&s;t all the prayers are directed to God alone. 2. That every <HI>hail Mary,</HI> both by the nature of the prayer, and the intention of the church, is directed more to the ho|nour of the &s;on than of the mother, as well becau&s;e the church, in honouring the mother, has principally in view the honour of the &s;on, as al&s;o becau&s;e this prayer particularly relates to the incarnation of Chri&s;t; and if withal it begs her prayers, then &s;he is only de&s;ired to pray for us.</P>
<P>To which if we add, that her prayers are ten times better and more acceptable to God than ours, it will appear no ways ab&s;urd that we &s;hould &s;o frequently de&s;ire her prayers; for as to the repetition of the &s;ame prayer, it is what is recommended to us by the
<PB N="224" REF="371">example of our Lord, St. Matt. xxvii. 42, 44, &amp;c. and has nothing of ab&s;urdity in it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the meaning of the <HI>Ro&s;ary?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The ro&s;ary is a method of &s;aying the beads, &s;o as to meditate upon the incarnation, pa&s;&s;ion and re|&s;urrection of Chri&s;t; and it is divided into three parts, each part con&s;i&s;ting of five my&s;teries, to be contem|plated during the repeating of five d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cads or te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s upon the beads. The fir&s;t five are called the five joyful my&s;teries, viz. the Anunciation, when our Lord was conceived in his mother's womb; the Vi|&s;ication, when the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin vi&s;ited her kin&s;wo|man St. Elizabeth, and by her was declared <HI>ble&s;&s;ed among women,</HI> &amp;c. the Nativity of our Lord, his pre&s;entment in the temple, together with the purifi|cation of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and his being found in the temple in the mid&s;t of the doctors, &amp;c. The five next are called the dolorous and &s;orrowful my&s;te|ries, as having relation to the pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and are, his prayer and agony in the garden, his being &s;courged at the pillar, his crowning with thorns, his carriage of his cro&s;s, and his crucifixion and death. The five la&s;t are called the five glorious my&s;teries, viz. the re&s;urrection of our Lord, his a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven, the coming of the Holy Gho&s;t, the a&s;&s;ump|tion of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and her coagmenation, to|gether with the eternal glory of the &s;aints in the kingdom of heaven

<P><HI>A.</HI> We hold it to be pious and profitable to apply our&s;elves to them in the way of de&s;iring them to pray to God for us; but not &s;o as to addre&s;s our&s;elves to them

<P><HI>A.</HI> The meaning of tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es, as far as they are authori&s;ed by the church, is no other than to beg mercy of the &s;aints in this &s;en&s;e, that they would pity and compa&s;&s;ionate our mi&s;ery, and would pray for us.

<P>On all common, but public occa&s;ions, the cro&s;s is carried before the &s;overeign Pontiff. At the end of a pike about ten palms or &s;pans long, the image of our Saviour is turned towards the Pope; and the chaplain, who carries it, walks bareheaded, when his holine&s;s goes in public, or is carried on mens &s;houlders; but when he goes in a coach or chair the chairman carries the crucifix on hor&s;eback bareheaded. But on all &s;olemn and religious occa&s;ions where the Pope attends in his &s;acred robes, an auditor of the rota carries the crucifix at the &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, on hor&s;eback, dre&s;&s;ed in a rocket and capuche, or &s;ort of cope, purple-coloured; but there are three days in Pa&s;&s;ion week on which he and the &s;acred college go to the chapel in mourning, without the cro&s;s being borne before him.</P>

<P>No &s;ooner do one enter their churches, than the eye is attracted by a number of lamps and wax|candles, which are con&s;tantly burning before the &s;hrines and images of their &s;aints.

The primitive writers frequently ex|po&s;e the folly and ab&s;urdity of this heatheni&s;h cu&s;tom; they light up candles to God, &s;ays Lactantius, as if he lived in the dark; and do not they de&s;erve to pa&s;s for madmen, who offer lamps to the author and giver of light? But this is a piece of zeal which continues &s;till the &s;ame in modern Rome, where each church abounds with lamps of ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver, the gifts of princes and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction; and it is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee how great a number of this kind are perpetually kept burning before the altars of their principal &s;aints or images, as St. Antony of Padua, or the lady of Loretta, as well as the va&s;t profu&s;ion of wax-candles with which their churches are illumi|nated on every great fe&s;tival, when the high altar,

<P>THE Greek church may (at lea&s;t) for &s;everal centu|ries be con&s;idered as a part of the Roman church, having the &s;ame apo&s;tolical foundation (nay, the church of Jeru&s;alem was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the apo&s;tles much

They likewi&s;e adhered pretty much to the doctrine of <HI>Arius,</HI> acknowledged the &s;u|premacy of the Father to the Son; and as it was the cu&s;tom of many of the bi&s;hops to draw up a creed for his own church, mo&s;t of their articles were con|formable to the canons and creed called the apo&s;tles, which in &s;ub&s;tance is of the greate&s;t antiquity; and did al&s;o admit of the Nicene creed, drawn up A. D. 318: but in proce&s;s of time the Nicene creed was new-modelled by the general council of Con&s;tantino|ple, A. D. 381, when that part of it relating to the con&s;ub&s;tantiality of the Son with the Father was reject|ed by them, and from this time we find &s;ome unchri&s;|tian animo&s;ity &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the ea&s;tern and we&s;|tern churches, each cen&s;uring and anathematizing each other. Many points merely &s;peculative di&s;tracted and divided the churches, pelagiani&s;m, and the authority of particular counc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls, &amp;c. and the&s;e not only conti|nued, but increa&s;ed to the &s;ixth century; councils con|vened in the ea&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e in the we&s;t; the remarkable di&s;putes (before mentioned) called the three chapters, and about the corruptibility or uncor|ruptibility of the body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and whether we may or ought to &s;ay that one of the <HI>Trinity</HI> &s;uffered, upon which many of the ea&s;tern churches &s;eparated in their communion from the church of Rome; and it is certain the Greek church made &s;ome good regula|tions.</P>
<P>In the &s;eventh century they convened a council, which fixed the di&s;cipline of the Greek church, made 102 canons, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, although they were
<PB N="249" REF="394">never received in the we&s;t, approving the canonical letters of St. Ba&s;il, appointed the my&s;teries of the &s;a|crament to be received ra&s;ting; they gave the &s;acra|ment in both kinds; mixed water with wine; forbad the eating chee&s;e or eggs in Lent, that there &s;hould be no fa&s;ting on Saturdays, and prohibited the eating of blood.</P>
<P>Other matters of di&s;pute contributed to widen their difference; and in the ninth century there was a con|te&s;t between the Pope of Rome, and the Patriarch of Con&s;tantinople, about Bulgaria. The P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe's legates affirmed it belonged to the Pope, and that the Bulga|rians ought to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the church of Rome. The ea&s;tern patriarchs a&s;&s;erted, that Bulgaria having been taken from the Greeks, and formerly go|verned by Greek bi&s;hops, ought to be &s;ubject to the patriarch of Con&s;tantinople: the Emperor likewi&s;e favoured the patriarch's party, and a divi&s;ion con&s;e|quently en&s;ued, A. D. 878. The Greeks &s;oon after preferred ten articles of accu&s;ation again&s;t the Latins; the fir&s;t was again&s;t the proce&s;&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t; the Greeks denying that the Holy Gho&s;t proceeded from the Father and the Son, and a&s;&s;erted his pro|ceeding from the Father only. They found fault with the Latins for not having eight weeks in their Lent, with the Latin prie&s;ts &s;having their beards, with their being obliged to celibacy, with their forbidding to anoint with the holy chri&s;m the foreheads of tho&s;e they bapti&s;ed. They charged them with making bi&s;hops of deacons, without fir&s;t conferring on them the order of prie&s;t; they oppo&s;ed the primacy of Rome, and would have preferred the Patriarchs of Con&s;tanti|nople, or at lea&s;t made them equal; they likewi&s;e charged the Latins with making the holy chri&s;m with river water, and with offering a lamb at Ea&s;ter, together with the body and blood of Chri&s;t, after the manner of the Jews.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="395">From this time we may with &s;ome propriety con|&s;ider the <HI>Greek church</HI> as di&s;tinct from the church of Rome, notwith&s;tanding &s;o great an agreement as there &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern churches, both in their principles and practices, e&s;pecially as the con&s;titution of the Greek church differs from that of Rome.</P>
<P>The Greek church, according to their original con|&s;titution, is governed by four patriarchs, viz. tho&s;e of Alexandria, of Jeru&s;alem, of Antioch, and of Con|&s;tantinople; the latter of which a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf the title of <HI>Univer&s;al,</HI> or <HI>Oecumenical</HI> Patriarch, on account of his re&s;iding in the imperial city, and ha|ving a larger juri&s;diction than the re&s;t.

This Patriarch likewi&s;e a&s;&s;umes the title of holine&s;s, in the ab&s;tract; and Cyril Lucar, at the beginning of one of his letters, a&s;&s;umes the title of oecumenical judge of the Chri&s;tian churches dependant on the imperial throne of Con|&s;tantinople

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>The following is a</HI> SUMMARY <HI>of the</HI> BELIEF <HI>and</HI> PRAC|TICE <HI>of the</HI> GREEK CHURCH.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. They believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible.</P>
<P N="2">II. In one lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the only begotten &s;on of God, begotten of his Father before all worlds, God of Gods, light of lights; very God of very God, be|gotten, not made, being one &s;ub&s;tance with the Father,
<PB N="251" REF="396">by whom all things were made: who for us men, and for our &s;alvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and was made man, and was crucified for us; al&s;o under Pon|tius Pilate; he &s;uffered and was buried, (or de&s;cended into the grave) and the third day he ro&s;e again accor|ding to the &s;criptures, and a&s;cended into heaven, and fitteth at the right-hand of the Father; and he &s;hall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead, of who&s;e kingdom there &s;hall be no end.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the Holy Gho&s;t proceeds only from the Fa|ther, not from the &s;on; yet they believe him to be God.</P>
<P N="4">IV. They do not acknowledge the Pope's &s;upre|macy, nor infallibility, nor con&s;equently that the church of Rome is the true mother-church; they even prefer their own to that of Rome, as the mo&s;t apo&s;tolical; and on Holy Thur&s;day excommunicate the Pope, and all the Latin prelates, as heretics and &s;chi&s;matics.</P>
<P N="5">V. They believe no other &s;acraments than bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper. Bapti&s;m they perform, by dip|ping the per&s;on three times under water di&s;tinctly, at the name of the FATHER, the SON, and of the HOLY GHOST. They u&s;e a kind of anointing, cro&s;&s;ing, &amp;c. in bapti&s;m. They bapti&s;e infants, and have one god|father or godmother, according to the &s;ex of the child. But bapti&s;m is often deferred by them, till their chil|dren are five, ten, or fifteen years of age, or longer, and they rebapti&s;e all the Latins who are admitted to their communion.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That the Lord's &s;upper ought to be admin&s;tered in both kinds, even to infants, before they can be capa|ble of di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;piritual food from any other. The laity are indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to receive the &s;acra|ment in both kinds. They &s;eal the bread in the euchari&s;t with the form of a cro&s;s. Their bread is lea|vened. They receive both the bread and wine toge|ther in a &s;poon, from the hands of a prie&s;t, and always fa&s;ting. Whether they acknowledge tran&s;ub&s;tantiation or not, which is di&s;puted, they pay a &s;uper&s;titious
<PB N="252" REF="397">veneration to their con&s;ecrated bread. They do not indeed carry it in proce&s;&s;ion, but after the prie&s;t has con&s;ecrated it, he elevates it, and &s;ays, <HI>Thou art my God; thou art my King, I adore thee; Lord have mercy upon me, mi&s;erable &s;inner,</HI> and in the whole of this &s;er|vice are extremely &s;uper&s;titious.</P>
<P N="7">VII. They exclude confe&s;&s;ion, confirmation, extreme unction, and matrimony, from being &s;acraments. Though they recommend a confe&s;&s;ion four times a year; yet they deny that auricular confe&s;&s;ion is a divine pre|cept, and at be&s;t regard it only as an injunction of the church, and in&s;i&s;t that it ought always to be free and voluntary; but is in no wi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to make a full di&s;covery of all their &s;ins, or of all the circum&s;tances attending them.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Confirmation is admini&s;tered immediately after bapti&s;m. This has always been e&s;teemed by them a part of the prie&s;t's office, and is not deferred to be performed by a bi&s;hop, in any of the Greek churches.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Extreme unction, as u&s;ed by the Papi&s;ts, is practi&s;ed in &s;ome degree; but they di&s;claim that name, or calling it a &s;acrament: the Greeks admini&s;ter it to all &s;ick per&s;ons, and as often as a per&s;on in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances might de&s;ire it, without waiting till the per|&s;on is at the point of death.</P>
<P N="10">X. They maintain likewi&s;e, that matrimony is no &s;acrament; but, on the contrary, an union that may be di&s;&s;olved, and that, in the ca&s;e of adultery, or other provocations, it may be lawful to &s;eparate. Their prie&s;ts are equally approved, if married before the tak|ing holy orders; but they don't indulge them in that re&s;pect afterwards. They think marriage a fourth time unlawful. They deny that fornication is a mor|tal &s;in.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Though they di&s;believe the notion of purgatory, they offer up prayers for the dead. The words of their office, cran&s;lated, run thus, "Grant, O Lord, that his &s;oul may be at re&s;t, in tho&s;e man&s;ions of light, con&s;ola|tion
<PB N="253" REF="398">and repo&s;e, from whence all grief and &s;orrow are for ever excluded."</P>
<P N="12">XII. They are divided as to their &s;entiments of hell, as of a different nature and duration. They, in gene|ral, favour the notion, that the torments of hell will not be eternal.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The Greeks, and all the ea&s;tern nations in ge|neral, are of opinion, that departed &s;ouls will not be immediately and perfectly happy; that the fir&s;t Pa|radi&s;e will be a &s;tate of repo&s;e, and the next of eternal felicity.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. They enjoin the ob&s;ervation of diver&s;e fa&s;ts and fe&s;tivals: they have four lents; the fir&s;t begins on the fourteenth of November; the &s;econd, the great lent before Ea&s;ter; the third, the week after Penteco&s;t; and the fourth, on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t. At the&s;e times they eat nothing that has blood, or oil, nor milk-meats, but herbs, and &s;hell-fi&s;h, and are &s;o extremely &s;uper&s;titious, that they &s;carce allow an egg or fle&s;h-broth to a &s;ick per&s;on. Yet they di&s;dain the Latins for their ob&s;er|vations of the vigils before the nativity of Chri&s;t, and the fe&s;tivals of the Virgin Mary and the apo&s;tles, as well as for their fa&s;ting in Ember-Week; they pro|hibit all fa&s;ting on Saturdays, except on the Saturday preceding Ea&s;ter.</P>
<P N="15">XV. They &s;trictly ab&s;tain from eating &s;uch things as have been &s;trangled, and &s;uch other meats as are prohibited in the <HI>Old Te&s;tament.</HI></P>
<P N="16">XVI. They reject the religious u&s;e of graven images, and &s;tatues, although they admit of pictures in their churches, and have a great veneration for them.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. They wor&s;hip angels, and pray to the Virgin Mary, pray and &s;ing hymns to the &s;aints, and are very &s;uper&s;titious in the hi&s;tories of them.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. They attend prayers, morning and evening, and enjoin prayers for Kings, and all civil and eccle&s;ia&s;|tical magi&s;trates, and for the conver&s;ion of &s;chi&s;matics and heretics.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="254" REF="399">XIX. They enjoin obedience and honour to the prie&s;t,</P>
<P N="20">XX. They forbid the laity to invade the rights and benefits of the clergy, and all kinds of &s;acrilegious acts.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. They forbid marrying in Lent, or on other fa&s;ts.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. They prohibit the frequenting theatres, and other Gentile cu&s;toms.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. They forbid the laity to read the books of heretics.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. Though they reject the Apocrypha, as being uncanonical; yet they hold &s;ome traditions of equal authority with the &s;cripture; and greatly venerate the writings of Ba&s;il, Chry&s;o&s;tom, Dama&s;cene, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. Of all the general councils that have been held in the Catholic church by the Popes at different times, they pay no regard to any after the &s;ixth; and reject the &s;eventh, which was the &s;econd held at Nice.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. Their excommunications are often made on very frivolous occa&s;ions.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. They hold ju&s;tification by faith and works conjointly.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. They deny that the office of &s;ubdeacon is at pre&s;ent an holy order.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. They have a great number of monks, all of St. Ba&s;il's order; the&s;e have their abbots. The pa|triarch, Metropolian, and bi&s;hops, are of this order.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. They have &s;our liturgies or ma&s;&s;es; St. James's, St. Chry&s;o&s;tom, St. Ba&s;il's, (which they prin|cipally e&s;teem) and Gregory the Great, which la&s;t is u&s;ed by the Latins, and they celebrate the ma&s;s in the old Greek tongue
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwith&s;tanding from the preceeding articles it appears, that the con&s;titution and doctrine of the Greek church is in &s;ome re|&s;pects modelled more agreeable to &s;cripture than the church of Rome; yet their extreme &s;uper&s;tition in the ob&s;ervation of their I eats, in the performance of the &s;acraments, their con&s;ecrated places, ve&s;tments, uten&s;ils, and even the hollowed ground, &s;hew they come very little behind the church of Rome in &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The French church, by acknowledging the Pope's &s;upremacy, and by per&s;evering inflexibly in the prin|ciples, and (with very little exception) to the numerous train of &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies of that holy mother church, may be con&s;idered as one of her perfectly obe|dient &s;ons. It is true, the French nation &s;oon per|ceived, that the Pope's claim was unlimited, and would affect not only the royal prerogative, but the liberty and property of his &s;ubjects; and therefore, in the ele|venth century, the French King not only objected to, but refu&s;ed compliance with &s;ome claims of the Pope relating to the right of conferring benefices. And though this di&s;pute, in the clo&s;e of the twelfth century, between Boniface VIII. and Philip I. King of France, produced &s;ome dreadful effects, the French never lo&s;t &s;ight of their point, but a&s;&s;erted the King's preroga|tive to what what was called the regale; and in the fif|teenth century, when the council of Trent had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the authority of the Pope, in oppo&s;ition to the prerogative of the King of France, he ordered his am|ba&s;&s;adors to prote&s;t again&s;t it; and in the year 1680, when Pope Innocent XI. &s;eemed determined to oppo&s;e his right, there was held a national council of the clergy to regulate this di&s;pute, who confirmed his right of the regale over all the churches of the kingdom. Yet &s;oon after Lewis XIV. to di&s;cover his &s;uper&s;titious venera|tion of the Pope, and his bigotted attachment to the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit of popery, or in complai&s;ance to the Pope, repealed the edict of Nantz, and bani&s;hed his Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, or treated them with cruel &s;everities.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="401">But notwith&s;tanding the acknowledged &s;upremacy of the Pope in &s;pirituals, the French church differs in &s;ome re&s;pects in its con&s;titution, privileges, liberties, &amp;c. for this church has all along pre&s;erved certain antient rights, that &s;he has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed almo&s;t time immemorial, neither are the&s;e privileges any grants of Popes, but certain franchi&s;es and immunities derived to her from her fir&s;t original, and which &s;he has taken care never to relinqui&s;h.</P>

<P N="5">V. The Pope has no authority to levy any tax or impo&s;ition upon the eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments, upon any pretence either of loan, vacancy, annates, tythes, procurations, or otherwi&s;e, without the King's order, and the con&s;ent of the clergy.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The Pope has no authority to depo&s;e the King, or grant away his dominions to any per&s;on whom&s;o|ever. His holine&s;s can neither excommunicate the King, nor ab&s;olve any of his &s;ubjects from their alle|giance.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The Pope likewi&s;e has no authority to excom|municate the King's officers, for the executing and di&s;charging their re&s;pective offices and functions.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Pope has no right to take cognizance, either by him&s;elf or his delegates, of any pre-eminences, or privileges, belonging to the crown of France, the

<P N="9">IX. Counts Palatine made by the Pope, are not acknowledged as &s;uch in France.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of the State of</HI> KNOWLEDGE <HI>and</HI> RELIGION <HI>in</HI> BRITAIN, <HI>more particularly from the fir&s;t Propagation, and con&s;e|quent</HI> ESTABLISHMENT <HI>of</HI> CHRISTIANITY, <HI>to the Com|cement of the Reign of</HI> WILLIAM <HI>the</HI> CONQUEROR, 1066.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall now take a retro&s;pective view of tho&s;e dark and babarous ages of the world, when pagani&s;m and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t idolatry had over&s;pread the&s;e i&s;les, and &s;uccinctly point out &s;ome remarkable occur|rences and circum&s;tances that intervened, and at length made way for the introduction and prevalence of Chri&s;|tianity, though for a long time after incumbered with a variety of Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;titions.</P>
<P>The antient inhabitants of Britain, not only at fir&s;t &s;ettling here, but for a con&s;iderable time, were in a &s;tate of ignorance and barbarity; nor indeed could it from the nature of things be otherwi&s;e, unle&s;s countries &s;hould happen to be peopled by large colonies from &s;ocieties that have already arrived to a con&s;iderable proficiency of knowledge and government, which could not po&s;&s;ibly be the ca&s;e in early periods. The per&s;ons who originally &s;ettled in the&s;e remote parts of Europe, being rude and unpoli&s;hed them&s;elves, were able to carry nothing along with them but their own &s;avage manners, and their own gro&s;s conceptions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t inhabitants of an uncultivated region generally apply them&s;elves to &s;uch employments and exerci&s;es as the want of provi&s;ion may urge them to; probably to hunting as the mo&s;t &s;peedy means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; the next &s;tage is pa&s;turage, and a third agri|culture; the la&s;t &s;tep is regulated governments: all the&s;e
<PB N="260" REF="405">mu&s;t, as it were, make way for the introduction of knowledge, the true&s;t &s;ource of religion.</P>
<P>Though England might be peopled &s;everal centu|ries before the fir&s;t accounts we have of it, yet the bar|barous condition in which we perceive it to have been, is no more than might rea&s;onably be expected. At the time when Cae&s;ar invaded the i&s;land, even hu&s;bandry it&s;elf does not &s;eem to have been univer&s;ally followed: our ance&s;tors however do not appear to have been without &s;ome &s;kill in war; for tho' in this re&s;pect they were greatly inferior to the Romans, yet they conducted their oppo&s;ition to Cae&s;ar in a manner that redounds highly to their credit, con&s;idering the amazing abilities of that general, and the excellent di&s;cipline of his army. Ambition and re&s;entment &s;eemed at this time to have gained the a&s;cendancy of their rea&s;on and humanity; that they had brought the wretched arts of mutual de|&s;truction much &s;ooner to perfection than tho&s;e which refine the &s;oul, and are cultivated to adorn, improve, and ble&s;s &s;ociety. To rectify this great di&s;order and unhappine&s;s, &s;ome per&s;ons were pretty early di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, by a &s;uperior penetration into the difference of principles and actions, who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions likewi&s;e led them to compa&s;&s;ionate the unhappy &s;tate of man|kind at that time, &s;o far &s;unk in ignorance and bar|bari&s;m. Some of the fir&s;t thus di&s;tingui&s;hed and em|ployed, famous in hi&s;tory, were the <HI>Druids</HI>

<P>The DRUIDS,
<NOTE>Hi&s;tory of the Druids.</NOTE> according to the general hi&s;tory of them, we are apt to look upon as per&s;ons of very extraordinary accom|pli&s;hments. This deception has been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by our poets, who have &s;pread a glory round them, and have painted them in a manner that di&s;po&s;es us to regard them as almo&s;t divine. No one has more charmingly contributed to carry on the delu&s;ion than the ingenious and elegant Ma&s;on, in his Caractacus. But if we re|duce
<PB N="261" REF="406">our ideas to the te&s;t of &s;ober rea&s;on, we &s;hall not find much in the Druids that was particularly excel|lent and valuable. They were the prie&s;ts of the time, and, like other prie&s;ts, had addre&s;s and &s;ubtility enough to acquire a va&s;t authority, and to keep the people in ab&s;olute &s;ubjection. They were likewi&s;e magi&s;|trates as well as prie&s;ts, and had the determination of civil cau&s;es; a circum&s;tance which was the natural effect, both of their &s;uperior quality, and &s;uperior knowledge; for what knowledge then prevailed, was principally confined to them. However, the remains we have of the Druids do not give us a very high opinion of the progre&s;s they had made, though undoubtedly they went far beyond the re&s;t of their countrymen, and it is probable that individuals among them might be men of great wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>They entertained the notion of tran&s;migration; a notion which has &s;pread from the farthe&s;t ea&s;t to the remote&s;t we&s;t, and which has been &s;o widely embraced, that a philo&s;ophical per&s;on cannot help looking on this fact as a &s;ingular phaenomenon in the hi&s;tory of hu|man nature, and imagine that either there is &s;ome|thing in it very natural to the unenlightened mind of man, or that it proceeded from an antient and general tradition. The be&s;t principles advanced by the Druids were, that the Deity is one, and infinite, and that his wor&s;hip ought not to be confined within walls; that all things derive their origin from heaven; that the &s;oul is immortal; and that children &s;hould be educated with the utmo&s;t care. But their prodigious veneration for the mi&s;letoe, and the great effects they attributed to it, their opinion that the moon is a &s;overeign remedy for di&s;ea&s;es, with others of their &s;entiments and cu&s;toms, &s;hewed a &s;trong &s;uper&s;tition; as their prohibiting an intercour&s;e with &s;trangers, if not merely a political law, te&s;tified a &s;avagene&s;s of manners; and their allowance, nay, command, of human &s;acrifices carries in it the evidence of the mo&s;t
<PB N="262" REF="407">&s;hocking cruelty. In truth, they were little more than the barbarous prie&s;ts of a barbarous and unle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tered people. Their knowledge is &s;aid to have reached to phy&s;ics, to the mathematics, to a&s;tronomy, and to medicine; but as it was never committed to writing, it could not be very exten&s;ive: indeed it chiefly con|&s;i&s;ted of the arcana of their doctrines and wor&s;hip, and had a &s;pecial relation to magic. Whatever their wi&s;dom was, if we may give credit to the te&s;timony of Cae&s;ar, it was found here in greater perfection than in Gaul; from whence children were &s;ent into Britain, to be in|&s;tructed in the di&s;cipline of the Druids. The &s;ame author informs us, that it had its original in this country; but that is a circum&s;tance much di&s;puted.</P>
<P>There were likewi&s;e prie&s;ts of an inferior order, called Bards, who&s;e principal bu&s;ine&s;s was to celebrate the prai&s;es of the gods and departed heroes, in odes and ver&s;es, and to &s;ing them to their harps, at their religious a&s;&s;emblies, public fe&s;tivals, and private en|tertainments. The&s;e men were, in fact, the heralds, the chronologers, and the hi&s;torians, as well as the poets of the land, for they kept up the memory of illu&s;trious tran&s;actions; and by their compo&s;itions, which tradition handed down to po&s;terity, they tran&s;|mitted from age to age the names and characters of patriots and warriors

<P>The divine <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf can be con&s;idered as no other than one of them, who&s;e con&s;ummate excellency, and a number of circum&s;tances, contributed to pre&s;erve his works from oblivion, and to rai&s;e him to the highe&s;t &s;eat in the temple of Fame. Bards have been found in many countries, and continued in Scotland and Ireland nearly to our own time. As to the antient Briti&s;h ones, we have few remains of their productions; but we may venture to a&s;&s;ert that many of them were truly valuable.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="408">There was another order of per&s;ons called <HI>Eub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tes,</HI> who applied them&s;elves to the contemplation of the works of nature, and the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy.

But all this time, wherever they con|quered, they were for poli&s;hing and reforming the manners of the inhabitants, and diffu&s;ing the know|ledge of arts and &s;ciences; though it mu&s;t be owned, that, during the warm conte&s;ts which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween the Romans and the Britons, when the latter &s;o gloriou&s;ly, &s;o bravely, though &s;o un&s;ucce&s;&s;ively, &s;trug|gled to maintain their independence, little progre&s;s could be made in literature: but when the country was peaceably &s;ettled into provinces, then civility began to &s;pread it&s;elf, and knowledge more generally diffu&s;ed, in&s;omuch that many of the Briti&s;h nobles &s;tudied the Roman learning, and valued them&s;elves on their magnificence and politene&s;s, becoming plea&s;ed with what was in fact the badges of their &s;lavery.</P>
<P>During this time there were, no doubt, &s;chools of philo&s;ophy, and &s;everal eminent men; but who were mo&s;t celebrated, or what &s;ciences were mo&s;t cultivated, we are not able to &s;ay, no traces of them being now

<P>But there is one event belonging to this aera,
<NOTE>A. D. 314.</NOTE> which, be&s;ides its own immen&s;e im|portance in other views, comes more immediately under my notice, viz. the propagation of chri&s;tianity in the&s;e i&s;les. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to inquire who was the per&s;on by whom the religion of Je&s;us was fir&s;t preached, or the exact time when it was introduced: &s;uppo&s;ing we reject all conjectures of its being pro|mulged by the apo&s;tles, or their immediate di&s;ciples, it is probable that it was very &s;oon communicated to the Britons. It might be gaining ground, and &s;pread greatly, before it received a civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, as we are informed of many martyrs who witne&s;&s;ed to the truth, under the per&s;ecution rai&s;ed by the Emperor Diocle&s;ian, of whom St. Albian is reckoned the proto|martyr of North Britain; and from the days of Con|&s;tantine the go&s;pel would no doubt be much diffu&s;ed, and generally embraced: accordingly we are a&s;&s;ured, that three Briti&s;h bi&s;hops a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the council of Ar|les, A. D. 314. and &s;ub&s;cribed the acts of that coun|cil.

<P>Now, &s;o illu&s;trious an event as the propagation of chri&s;tianity in this country, could not take place with|out bringing along with it a mighty change in the &s;tate of knowledge; all tho&s;e who embraced our holy religion were turned from gro&s;s idolatry and ab&s;urd &s;uper&s;tition, to the belief and wor&s;hip of one God. The reception of it was a va&s;t acqui&s;ition of wi&s;dom, as it contributed in many re&s;pects to expand the mind, and &s;often the manners of our ance&s;tors; it would not in tho&s;e &s;imple times, when human rea&s;on was more imperfect than it now is, produce &s;uch noble and extended views of

<P>What the particular &s;tate of religion was, it is dif|ficult to a&s;certain; but we find doctrinal di&s;putes agi|tated men in tho&s;e days, as well as in &s;ucceeding pe|riods. The notions of Arius are &s;aid to have been embraced in this country, and it is an undoubted fact, that Pelagiani&s;m was very prevalent. It was &s;o pre|valent as to occa&s;ion &s;harp controver&s;ies, and &s;ome bi&s;hops were &s;ent over from Gaul to recover the Bri|tons to the oppo&s;ite opinions, though without any la&s;t|ing &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>From about this time,
<NOTE>424</NOTE> when the Romans leave Britain, there aro&s;e a confu&s;ed &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Bri|ti&s;h Kings, or rather petty tyrants, for twenty years

<P>Vortigern,
<NOTE>447</NOTE> not a little agitated by his fears, which were the more predominant from a con|&s;eiou&s;ne&s;s of his demerit, employed his emi&s;&s;aries to a|larm the nobility with the exaggerated accounts of the &s;trength, de&s;tination, and malevolence of their old enemies the Scots and Picts. Having thus artfully pre|pared their minds for the propo&s;al, he &s;ummoned them to a general council, on pretence of deliberating on the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;tate, and there managed their pa&s;&s;ions with &s;uch dexterity, that they inve&s;ted him with full power to invite the Saxons into England, and a&s;&s;ign to them the i&s;le of Thanet for their habitation.</P>
<P>The Saxons did not long remain inactive:
<NOTE>452</NOTE> Vor|tigern being pre&s;&s;ed by his enemies from the north, they marched again&s;t the Scots and Picts, who had advanced as far as Stamford in Lincoln&s;hire, when a battle en&s;ued, in which the Saxons and Britons ob|tained a complete victory; after which the Saxons re|turned to the place of their de&s;tination, where they were &s;upplied with food and raiment at the expence of Vortigern, who would have had no cau&s;e perhaps to repent of their arrival, which were only about 1500; but their own country being populous, and withal &s;o barren, and the fertile lands of Britain &s;o agreeable and alluring, that, in a very little time, they were reinfor|ced with 5000 men, formed the ambitious view of be|coming &s;ole ma&s;ters of England, and indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought an occa&s;ion of quarrel, and, after &s;ome &s;trug|gles for victory,
<NOTE>477</NOTE> the la&s;t of which was an incur|&s;ion of the Saxons under Hengi&s;t and E&s;ca, the Britons were defeated, and became the &s;ubjects of the Saxons. This was an event not only prejudicial in general to the liberties and properties of Britain, but to &s;cience and religion in particular. Vortigern was
<PB N="267" REF="412">by this time become a contemptible parti&s;an of the Saxons, and &s;o immer&s;ed in vice and debauchery, that St. Germanus, deputy of the Gallican church in Bri|tain, reprimanded him for his di&s;&s;olute life; that he was anathemati&s;ed in a council of the Briti&s;h clergy, and his &s;ubjects di&s;charged of their allegiance.</P>
<P>And whatever the &s;tate of knowledge might be in this i&s;land before the introduction of the Saxons, it certainly received a great change for the wor&s;e at that period. The repeated inva&s;ions of tho&s;e barbarians, the wars they rai&s;ed, and the de&s;olations they occa&s;i|oned, &s;pread a general con&s;u&s;ion, di&s;per&s;ed the Bri|tons to the remote&s;t parts of the country, de&s;troyed the monuments of learning, and left no room for the improvement and cultivation of the mind.</P>
<P>The few literary records we have, relate only to &s;uch per&s;ons as lived where the Saxons did not rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h. The &s;chools founded by Dubricius and Iltutus in North Wales, produced &s;everal men who&s;e names have been tran&s;mitted with honour to po&s;terity; though in fact we are but little acquainted with their real attainments. Among the&s;e were Patrick and David, who exerted them&s;elves much in preaching the go&s;pel, and whom the &s;uper&s;tition of latter ages hath advanced into tute|lary &s;aints, the fir&s;t of Ireland, and the &s;econd of Wales. The mona&s;tery of Bangor was particularly famous for the education of youth. A number of &s;cholars were brought up in it, who made &s;ome figure in their days; and among the re&s;t Gildas, who wrote a treati&s;e upon the de&s;truction of Britain, and from whom we principally derive our information concern|ing the &s;tate of things during the latter end of the fifth, and part of the &s;ixth century.</P>
<P>To the Saxons let us now direct our view,
<NOTE>Hi&s;tory of the Saxons, and K. Eth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lhert's conver&s;ion.</NOTE> and, with re&s;pect to knowledge, we &s;hall find them in a di&s;mal &s;ituation. They were in the lowe&s;t condition of ignorance, rudene&s;s, and barbarity; their religious wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ted of the
<PB N="268" REF="413">gro&s;&s;e&s;t idolatry, and they &s;acrificed pri&s;oners of war to the Gods. The fir&s;t circum&s;tance of any note among them, was, the reception of the go&s;pel by Ethelbert, the King of Kent, and his &s;ubjects. His Queen Bertha, who was daughter or niece to Chilperic, King of Pa|ris, and a Chri&s;tian, had, together with Lindhard, a bi&s;hop, as it is &s;aid, of piety and learning, who attend|ed her from France, prepared the way for this great event, by converting &s;everal per&s;ons, and by produ|cing a favourable di&s;po&s;ition in the mind of her hu&s;|band. But the grand work was carried on by Au&s;tin, and other monks, &s;ent by Pope Gregory from Rome. One thing in this affair de&s;erves to be taken notice of, which is, that Ethelbert, whether it was owing to the good impre&s;&s;ions of his lady, or the natural dictates of rea&s;on working in his own rude, but unprejudiced un|der&s;tanding, allowed to his people the utmo&s;t liberty of con&s;cience. He treated the mi&s;&s;ionaries with re&s;|pect, heard them with attention, and permitted them to propagate their doctrines without interruption; both before and after he had embraced chri&s;tianity, he left his &s;ubjects to an entire freedom of judging and acting for them&s;elves. His conver&s;ion, however, was fol|lowed by that of the whole nation; a fact the le&s;s to be wondered at, when we con&s;ider that the barbarians, having no &s;ettled &s;entiments, are in general ready to receive any which are offered by &s;uch as excel them in knowledge, and e&s;pecially when encouraged by their own prince. This is confirmed by a variety of in&s;tances in the hi&s;tory of the world; for we &s;hall al|mo&s;t always find, that the ignorant and upoli&s;hed con|querors of a civilized country &s;ubmitted, without much he&s;itation, to the religion of the people they had &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>As to the change that was produced by Au&s;tin and his attendants in the principles and manners of the Saxons, it was not, to &s;peak the mo&s;t favourably of it, by any means &s;o happy an alteration as would have
<PB N="269" REF="414">been brought about, had the go&s;pel been preached in purer ages. The truth at that age was mixed with &s;o much error and &s;uper&s;tition, that the under&s;tanding of our ance&s;tors could not be &s;o greatly enlarged, by the reception of chri&s;tianity, as at fir&s;t we might be apt to &s;uppo&s;e; for, however upright the intentions of Au&s;tin might be, it is evident by many in&s;tances that he was a very weak man.</P>
<P>Au&s;tin, otherwi&s;e called Augu&s;tin, arrived in Eng|land in the year 591 as a &s;imple monk and mi&s;&s;ionary; &s;oon after which he was honoured with the Pope's pall, and created bi&s;hop of Canterbury. In this character he obtained no &s;mall influence over Ethelbert, and was the in&s;trument of his conver&s;ion to chri&s;tianity. He very &s;oon after a&s;&s;umed the pomp and authority of a patriarchal metropolian, or apo&s;tle of the Engli&s;h na|tion. He was indeed con&s;ecrated as &s;uch at Arles, to which he made a voyage for that purpo&s;e; and at his return to Britain he &s;ent Laurentius, with a monk cal|led Peter, to make the Pope acquainted with the &s;ucce&s;s of his labours, and de&s;ire his opinion and direction touching certain points relating to the behaviour of the bi&s;hops and clergy. His holine&s;s having con&s;idered and replied to the que&s;tions, which with their an&s;wers may be &s;een in Bede's hi&s;tory of the church, &s;ent over Melitus, Paulus, Ju&s;tus, Melinus, and Ru&s;inianus, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in converting the Saxons; at the &s;ame time he tran&s;mitted directions about erecting &s;ees among the new convents, with a pall for Augu&s;tin, which is an undyed piece of woollen cloth, laid upon St. Peter's tomb by the Pope's own hand, and worn over the &s;houlders by the metropolitans when they officiate. Augu&s;tin was likewi&s;e permitted by his ma&s;ter to convert the Pagan temples into Chri&s;tian churches, after due purification, and to in&s;titute anni|ver&s;ary &s;e&s;tivals of &s;aints and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ations, upon which the good people &s;hould build booths around tho&s;e places of wor&s;hip, kill oxen, eat, drink, and be merry,

<P>Some have a&s;&s;erted, that Au&s;tin and &s;ome others, with more probability than Paulinus, bapti&s;ed ten thou&s;and in one day. To which &s;oever of them this fact is attributed, it is probable that the&s;e numerous con|ver&s;ions were too much like tho&s;e &s;ince carried on by popi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries, and con&s;i&s;ted more in a change of outward profe&s;&s;ion, than any real alteration of &s;enti|ments, di&s;po&s;itions, and manners. This is farther ap|parent from the Saxons being allowed to retain many of their Pagan cu&s;toms and rites of wor&s;hip, provided they applied them to other objects; a permi&s;&s;ion which, though calculated to an&s;wer political purpo&s;es, was directly contrary to the practice of the apo&s;tles, and in its very nature de&s;tructive to the progre&s;s of true religion.</P>
<P>As for Ethelbert, he was become &s;o zealous a con|vert, that he bequeathed his own palace to the church, and retired to Reculver, that Augu&s;tin might be more at his ea&s;e at Canterbury. Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e favours, and the princely magnificence in which he lived, this pious apo&s;tle could enjoy no content while the Briti&s;h clergy lived independent of his authority, and un&s;ubjected to the &s;ee of Rome.</P>
<P>Independent, therefore, of the de&s;ire which Au&s;tin had to diffu&s;e the light of the go&s;pel in general, we find he was particularly zealous for his own authority, and extremely &s;olicitous to &s;ubject the Briti&s;h Chri&s;|tians, in the remote parts of the i&s;land, to his metro|politan juri&s;diction, and to the doctrines and di&s;cipline of the &s;ee of Rome. This is a circum&s;tance the more remarkable, as the Briti&s;h bi&s;hops of that age had more enlarged views of things: accordingly they di&s;|claimed all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Roman church, and nobly a&s;&s;erted their independence

O&s;wy, King of that country, con&s;ider|ing the difference as a &s;ubject of great importance, propo&s;ed a conference at Whitby in York&s;hire, between Colman, one of the Scotti&s;h prelates, &s;upported by &s;everal monks of his nation, and Wilfred, who had already brought over the Queen to his opinion. The di&s;pute was of con&s;equence decided in favour of this courtly abbot; while Colman and his party recoun|ced their preferment, and retired to Scotland.</P>
<P>About the year A. D. 709, a &s;ynod was held at Alance&s;ter, in Worce&s;ter&s;hire, to promote the build|ing of Eve&s;ham abbey, which was done accordingly; and the &s;ame was bountifully endowed by Offa, and other Mercian kings, with large revenues. Not long after another &s;ynod was called at London, to introduce into England the practice of image-wor&s;hip, which as yet was no public practice. Much about the &s;ame time it became fa&s;hionable for the Kings and Queens of England to turn monks and nuns, and re|tire into convents; &s;o that in the &s;pace of a few years nine di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by this monki&s;h practice. From hence we may likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ert, that the Romi&s;h power and &s;uper&s;tition gained ground in the Engli&s;h nations. Aldhelm, bi&s;hop of Sherborn, wrote a book in favour of the Romi&s;h time, and manner of celebrating Ea&s;ter, which had no &s;mall in|fluence on the minds of the people.</P>
<P>The &s;ee of Canterbury was at the death of Cuth|bert filled with Bridwin, a noble Saxon, of remarkable piety and di&s;cretion. But he &s;urvived but three years, when Adulph being elected archbi&s;hop, received the pall from Pope Paul V. This prelate exerted all his intere&s;t and indu&s;try to prevent Offa, King of the Mercians, from erecting an archiepi&s;copal &s;ee within his domi|nions, by which his own metropolitanical power would be di&s;membered; but Pope Adrian, to whom the di&s;pute was referred, decided in favour of Offa, whom he empowered to erect Litchfield into an archbi&s;hopric,
<PB N="282" REF="427">to which all the Mercian bi&s;hops were declared &s;uf|fragans.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t blow given to the independency of the Briti&s;h church, for it fixed Offa and his new elected archbi&s;hop Adulph, in the intere&s;t of Rome, which was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the great influence it had gained by this compliance with Offa's ambition, that the Pope &s;ent Gregory bi&s;hop of O&s;tia, and Theophi|lact, another prelate, in quality of legates to England. The&s;e came on pretence of reforming the di&s;cipline of the Engli&s;h church, and executing the partition of the metropolitanical power of Canterbury. A &s;ynod was accordingly held in Northumberland, and gave an a&s;&s;ent to all the articles which had been al|ready prepared by the legates. The&s;e were in effect little more than a confirmation of canons, which had formerly received the &s;anction of the church, except|ing however two new articles, one of which is an admonition to kings to re&s;pect the clergy, and the other a caution to the people again&s;t chu&s;ing illegiti|mate &s;overeigns. The decrees of this &s;ynod were afterwards confirmed by another, held at Calcluith, which was more frequent and full than the other, and Adulph received the pall from Rome, without Lam|bert's daring to murmur, for fear of being impeached of trea&s;onable practices.</P>
<P>Offa having exerted him&s;elf &s;o much in favour of the church, was con&s;idered in other countries as a very religious Prince, and received from Charlemagne the de|crees of the &s;econd councils of Nice, recommending image-wor&s;hip, again&s;t which the famous Alcuin, who was an Engli&s;hman, and a tutor to Charlemagne, had writ with great energy and learning. Indeed his performance had a remarkable effect among the Ger|mans, for by means of it image-wor&s;hip was &s;olemnly condemned at the council of Frankfort

<P><PB N="283" REF="428">Several &s;ynods were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively held at Canterbury, at Clove&s;hoo, at Calcluith, and another afterwards at Clove&s;hoo, all relating to matters of a beneficiary nature, and to the prerogative of the Pope or Princes.</P>
<P>In the year of our Lord 747,
<NOTE>Decrees of the &s;ynod of Clove&s;hoo, A. D. <HI>747.</HI></NOTE> there was a famous &s;ynod held at Clove&s;hoo, or Clyff, near Roche&s;ter in Kent. The matter of the debate related to the govern|ment and di&s;cipline of the church. This &s;ynod was compo&s;ed of twelve Engli&s;h prelates; Ethelbald like|wi&s;e King of the Mercians, and the temporal nobility, were pre&s;ent at it, and many of the clergy. The following compendium of the decrees of this &s;ynod will afford us an idea of the &s;tate of religion at that time.</P>
<P>At the opening of the &s;ynod, Pope Zachary's letters were fir&s;t read in the original by archbi&s;hop Cuthbert, and then tran&s;lated to the audience. In the&s;e letters, as <HI>Malmsbury</HI> relates, the Pope admoni&s;hed the Engli&s;h clergy to reform their lives, and threatened tho&s;e with excommunication that continued in their irregularities.</P>
<P>This preliminary being over, the bi&s;hops proceeded to draw up a body of canons, &s;ome of which I &s;hall mention.</P>
<P>1&s;t, It was decreed, that every bi&s;hop &s;hould be care|ful to &s;upport his character, execute every part of his office, and maintain the canons and con&s;titutions of the church, again&s;t all &s;ort of liberty or encroachment. And that tho&s;e of this order &s;hould an&s;wer the expec|tations of their &s;tations, nor engage in &s;ecular affairs &s;o far as to be di&s;abled for their functions; but to be remarkably eminent for their probity, &s;elf-denial, and learning; that by this means they may be qualified to make an impre&s;&s;ion upon the people, both by their in&s;tructions, and by their practice.</P>
<P>2dly, That the prelates and clergy &s;hould be careful to keep a good corre&s;pondence with each other, with|out any flattering applications to any per&s;on; con&s;ider|ing that they are the &s;ervants of the &s;ame ma&s;ter, and intru&s;ted with the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion; and there|fore,
<PB N="284" REF="429">though they are divided by di&s;tance of place and country, they ought to be united in affection, and pray for each other, that every one may di&s;charge his office with integrity and con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The&s;e two canons, but e&s;pecially the la&s;t, &s;eem to be drawn on purpo&s;e to guard the liberties of the Engli&s;h church again&s;t the preten&s;ions of Rome, and to throw off that precedent of &s;ervitude, which <HI>Boni|face</HI> had &s;et them in his letter to archbi&s;hop <HI>Cuthbert.</HI> It is true, they do not mention the Pope; but by obliging the bi&s;hops to &s;tand up in defence of the an|tient canons, not to flatter any per&s;on upon the &s;core of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;tinction, becau&s;e the bi&s;hops have all of them the honour of the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion and employment; the&s;e general glances, with the grounds, upon which they &s;tand, &s;eem plainly de&s;igned to fence again&s;t that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the papal chair which Boniface recommended.</P>
<P>3dly, That the re&s;pective bi&s;hops &s;hould vi&s;it their dioce&s;e every year, call the people of all ranks and conditions together, and be particularly careful to preach to tho&s;e, who lie mo&s;t out of the way of in&s;truc|tion; and not &s;uffer any unwarrantable and heatheni&s;h cu&s;toms, &s;uch as divination, amulets, charms, &amp;c. to continue in the dioce&s;e.</P>
<P>The fourth, fifth, and &s;eventh, relate to the regu|lation of mona&s;teries. The &s;ixth orders the bi&s;hops not to ordain any prie&s;t, without a previous exami|nation upon the points of learning and morals.</P>
<P>The eighth puts the prie&s;ts in mind of the advan|tage of their character, and the bu&s;ine&s;s for which they were ordained. That they ought to ab&s;tract them&s;elves from the world as much as may be, and &s;pend their time in reading, prayer and exhortation, and other exerci&s;es of religion; and, more particularly in the next canon, they are enjoined to preach, bap|ti&s;e, and in&s;pect the manners of the laity in tho&s;e precincts and divi&s;ions a&s;&s;igned them by their re&s;pective
<PB N="285" REF="430">bi&s;hops. From hence it appears, that the &s;ubdivi&s;ions of the dioce&s;es were in &s;ome mea&s;ure formed, and the lines of pari&s;hes &s;truck out.</P>
<P>The tenth canon orders the prie&s;ts to be thoroughly acquainted with the doctrine and &s;ervice of the church; to teach the creed and Lord's prayer in Engli&s;h, and explain the &s;acraments to the people. This direction is agreeable to Bede's advice to <HI>Egbert</HI> bi&s;hop of York; where he tells him, that both the clergy and laity ought to have the creed and Lord's prayer by heart; and that him&s;elf had tran&s;lated them into Engli&s;h for the advantage of the common people, and tho&s;e that did not under&s;tand Latin.</P>
<P>In the eleventh canon, the prie&s;ts are enjoined to be uniform in the exerci&s;e of their function, and to bapti&s;e, preach and govern with the &s;ame rules and mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The twelfth regulates the church-mu&s;ic, provides for the &s;olemnity of the performance, and forbids the clergy to profane the &s;ervice with the air of the theatre. And in the clo&s;e of the canon, the prie&s;ts are enjoined to keep within the bounds of their order, and not to do any thing which belongs to the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>By the thirteenth, the holy days are to be kept every where on the &s;ame day, and the time to be governed by the Roman martyrology.</P>
<P>The fourteenth provides for the religious ob&s;er|vance of the Sunday or Lord's day, that it ought to be wholly dedicated to God's &s;ervice; that all &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s and travelling, unle&s;s in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, ought to be forborn; that the people are to be called to church to hear the word of God, and re|ceive the &s;acraments.</P>
<P>The fifteenth orders the &s;even canonical hours of prayer &s;hould be con&s;tantly ob&s;erved according to cu&s;|tom, and that nothing &s;hould be introduced but what
<PB N="286" REF="431">is warrantable by the authority of &s;cripture, and agree|able to the practice of the Roman church.</P>
<P>By the &s;ixteenth, the litanies or rogations are en|joined to be kept with great &s;olemnity by the clergy and people; that which is called the great litany, by the Romi&s;h church, is ordered to be kept the twenty-fourth day of April.</P>
<P>The other, which &s;tands upon the antient practice of the i&s;land, falls three days before our Saviour's a&s;cen|&s;ion; on which divine &s;ervice is to be performed, and the people to fa&s;t till three in the afternoon.</P>
<P>By the &s;eventeenth, the days on which St. Gregory the Great, and Augu&s;tin, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, died, are to be made holy-days; and that in &s;inging the li|tany, the name of Augu&s;tine &s;hall be mentioned after St. Gregory.</P>
<P>The eighteenth canon provides for the &s;olemn times of fa&s;ting in Ember-weeks: and that the people &s;hould have notice given to provide them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The nineteenth and twentieth relate to the govern|ment and behaviour of mona&s;teries, with re&s;pect to habit, company and employment.</P>
<P>The twenty-fir&s;t is levelled again&s;t drunkenne&s;s, luxury, and in&s;obriety of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;econd, enjoins the religious to live in a con&s;tant preparation for the receiving the &s;acrament of the holy euchari&s;t, or the body and blood of our Sa|viour, as the canon words expre&s;s it.</P>
<P>From hence I &s;hall pa&s;s to the twenty-fifth, by which the bi&s;hops, at their coming from their &s;ynod, are ob|liged to convene the prie&s;ts and abbots of their dioce&s;es, to publi&s;h the canons of the council, and command their ob&s;ervance. And if any di&s;order proves too &s;trong for the bi&s;hop's correction, he is to acquaint the archbi&s;hop with it at the meeting of the next &s;ynod. But not a word of carrying the complaint farther to Rome.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="432">The twenty-&s;ixth &s;tates the right u&s;e of charity, and provides again&s;t wrong views and mi&s;applications in this duty; and here the &s;ynod declares, that alms are not given to commute for <HI>penance,</HI> to di&s;pen&s;e with the di&s;cipline of the church, or procure us a liberty for &s;inning: that tho&s;e who think the ju&s;tice of God can be bribed in this manner, make their charity in&s;ignifi|cant, and bring an addition to their guilt: that alms &s;ignifies <HI>mercy</HI> both in the name and thing; and that they are no le&s;s a charity to the giver than to the re|ceiver. And therefore he that has a true compa&s;&s;ion for his own &s;oul, &s;hould always give that which is his own, and not circumvent or oppre&s;s one neighbour to be charitable to another.</P>
<P>The twenty-&s;eventh dilates upon the u&s;efulne&s;s, and directs in the manner and qualifications, of &s;inging p&s;alms. That this part of divine &s;ervice ought to be performed with due recollection, with pious di&s;po&s;itions and po&s;tures of re&s;pect; and, after the &s;inging is ended, there are prayers mentioned both for the living and the dead; and tho&s;e that do not under&s;tand Latin, are to pray in the vulgar tongue. The prayer for the dead runs thus: <HI>O Lord, we be&s;eech thee, for thy great mercy, grant that the &s;oul of</HI> &s;uch a per&s;on <HI>may be &s;e|cured in a &s;tate of indi&s;turbance and repo&s;e; and that he may be admitted, with the re&s;t of thy &s;aints, into the re|gions of light and happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>This canon, like the la&s;t, puts the people in mind not to depend upon the performance of one branch of duty, to the neglect of another. It &s;eems &s;ome people began to believe that one good action was a &s;ort of di&s;|pen&s;ation in other ca&s;es; and, which was &s;till more ex|travagant, they fancied they might perform their duty by proxy, built upon foreign merit, and be good by the virtue of their neighbours. The canon is the larger in expo&s;ing the vanity and danger of this reli|ance, becau&s;e they had a large in&s;tance of &s;uch an un|rea&s;onable expectation in a layman of condition.
<PB N="288" REF="433">This per&s;on, it &s;eems, had forfeited the communion of the church, and was put under di&s;cipline for &s;ome great crime: now he de&s;ired the rigour of his penance might be taken off, and that he might be reconciled upon the &s;ugge&s;tion following. He acquainted tho&s;e &s;piritual directors he belonged to, that he had procured &s;everal per&s;ons to fa&s;t, &s;ing p&s;alms, and di&s;tribute cha|rity on his account; &s;o that if he was to live three hun|dred years, there was enough done for him by other good people, though he &s;hould do little or nothing him&s;elf: but the canon declares, with great indigna|tion, again&s;t the folly of &s;uch a pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>The la&s;t <HI>canon</HI> enjoins, That Kings and Princes, and the whole body of the commonwealth, &s;hall be pub|lickly prayed for in the church.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hops names that &s;at in this &s;ynod were, Cuthbert, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; Dunnus, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, &amp;c.; and Podda, bi&s;hop of Leice&s;ter, &amp;c. Lin&s;ey, who governed the &s;ees of Winche&s;ter, Sherborne, &amp;c. in the kingdom of the We&s;t Saxons; Herdulp, bi&s;hop of Dunwich and Helman; Egwulf, bi&s;hop of London; Milred, of Worce&s;ter; Alwi, of Lind&s;ey; and Sigga, of Selcey in Su&s;&s;ex: but Eg|bert, being of the royal family and brother to King Eadbert, was not there.</P>
<P>When the &s;ynod broke up, archbi&s;hop Cuthbert di&s;patched his deacon to give Boniface, archbi&s;hop of Mentz, an account of what was done, pur&s;uant to the true intent and de&s;ign thereof by Ethelbald, and tho&s;e bi&s;hops who acceded to its convention, and con|firmed the decrees by their &s;ub&s;cription

<P>ETHELBERT VI.

Offa likewi&s;e procured the canonization of St. Alban, the ab&s;olution of his own &s;ins and many murders, and then returning home founded the mona&s;tery of St. Alban, be&s;towed great riches upon it in lands, exempted it from paying Peter-pence, epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, and the like, and died the next year.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>EGBERT, <HI>the Fir&s;t King of England,</HI> A. D. 800.</HEAD>
<P>Egbert, King of the We&s;t Saxons, in the year 800, having vanqui&s;hed Mercia, Kent, E&s;&s;ex, and Northumberland, received a general invitation to accept the &s;overeignty of England, both in church and &s;tate; in con&s;equence of which he returned and mounted the throne of We&s;&s;ex, and began to reign over a people both rich and powerful, in who&s;e affluence and affection he fore&s;aw his own future greatne&s;s. He had, in all probability, already planned the union of the heptarchy; but before he would impart the lea&s;t hint of that de&s;ign to the other Saxon nations, he re&s;olved to humble the Britons in &s;uch a manner that they &s;hould be in no condition
<PB N="290" REF="435">to interfere with the execution of his grand project. Mean while, in order to avert the &s;u&s;picion of the Saxons, he acted as a mediator in all the differences &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the princes of the heptarchy, and in particular effected a reconciliation between Car|dulf King of Northumberland, and Kenulf King of Mercia, who had taken the field again&s;t each other, and were on the eve of terminating their quarrel by the &s;word.</P>
<P>The&s;e good offices; employed with &s;uch moderation, the prudence he manife&s;ted in his own government, and known capacity in the affairs of war and peace, rai&s;ed his character to &s;uch a degree of reputation, that he was con&s;idered as the father of the Engli&s;h nation, and cho&s;en chief of the Saxon heptarchy.</P>
<P>Egbert having united the heptarchy, was &s;o engaged by continual wars, that he had very little time to ad|vert to eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs; and the&s;e troubles detached the people &s;o much from the practice and &s;tudy of re|ligious duties, that the whole nation was over&s;pread with ignorance, and a total relaxation of morals en&s;ued. During this reign, however, Withlaf, the tributary King of Mercia, granted to the abbey of Croyland a famous charter, which was confirmed by the &s;tates of the kingdom. Among other privileges and exemptions contained in this charter, it ordained that the mona&s;tery of Croyland &s;hould be held as a &s;anctuary, which no officer of ju&s;tice &s;hould pre&s;ume to violate, on pain of lo&s;ing his right foot; and that the abbots and monks &s;hould be entertained through all parts of Mercia, with all the honours and di&s;tinc|tion due to a prince of the blood. This deed was confirmed by Egbert, and &s;eems to have been the only eccle&s;ia&s;tical tran&s;action of his reign: but his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Ethelwulf, who was entirely governed by the clergy, and left the admini&s;tration to Swithin, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, extended his compliance to the
<PB N="291" REF="436">church farther than it had ever been carried by any of his predece&s;&s;ors, and be&s;towed upon it the tythes of all England, in an authentic charter, confirmed in a general a&s;&s;embly at Winche&s;ter, and &s;igned by the &s;ub&s;tituted kings of Mercia and Ea&s;t Anglia.</P>
<P>It might naturally be expected, that when the &s;even kingdoms came under the dominion of one Prince, the &s;tate of things would grow better, and knowledge begin to revive in England: but the fact was far other|wi&s;e; and if we enquire into the cau&s;es of it, &s;everal circum&s;tances will be found that contributed to the production of the contrary event; the wars carried on by Egbert again&s;t his neighbours gave ri&s;e to much confu&s;ion and de&s;olation, and when he had reduced the nation under his government, it would be &s;till a con&s;iderable time before affairs would be brought into &s;o peaceable and flouri&s;hing a condition, as was nece&s;&s;ary to the progre&s;s of learning. Moreover, the &s;pirit of the age was directly oppo&s;ite to literary improvement, an univer|&s;al ignorance prevailed, and there was no thought about the cultivation and improvement of human nature. To this concurred the ab&s;urd &s;entiments that were propaga|ted with regard to religion, and the enormous power and influence of the clergy, which could only be &s;upported by the ignorance and &s;tupidity of the people. Indeed the &s;ituation of the whole world, during this period, and for many centuries, afford a &s;trong proof, that where the &s;criptures are neglected, and rational prin|ciples concerning religious matters totally excluded, the other branches of &s;cience, and the faculties of the mind in general, will greatly &s;uffer. It may perhaps be &s;uppo&s;ed that the mona&s;teries had a tendency to pre&s;erve and favour literature: but whatever their tendency was, they had in reality rather a contrary effect; they were not examples of piety, or &s;eats of the mu&s;es; the per&s;ons who re&s;ided in them did not &s;ix upon them as retreats to awaken their devotion, and
<PB N="292" REF="437">enlarge their under&s;tanding, but as places where they might live exempt from military &s;ervice, and &s;ecurely indulge their lu&s;t and vices; &s;o that mona&s;teries were little el&s;e than the abodes of wickedne&s;s. Bede com|plains of them again and again in his writings, and he has told us they were in &s;o corrupt a &s;tate, that &s;uch as de&s;ired to be &s;incerely pious were obliged to go abroad for education
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Library, p. 180.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Bede likewi&s;e informs us, that the Chri&s;tian church at that time was far gone from its original purity; for the monks had introduced &s;everal practices into the church, which were not of apo&s;tolic in&s;titution, making u&s;e of every means in their power to in&s;pire people with great reverence for the Pope of Rome, and to an high veneration for mona&s;teries, &s;o that it is &s;urpri&s;ing how many was erected, and how richly they were endowed even in the infancy of the church.</P>
<P>The reigns of <HI>Ethelbald, Ethelbert,</HI> and <HI>Ethelred</HI> I. are very barren of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical matter; except the de&s;truction of mona&s;teries by the Danies, which the hi&s;torians in tho&s;e days have de&s;cribed in very pathetic terms; regretting in particular the three famous con|vents of Croyland, Ely, and Maderham&s;tede, in which the monks were ma&s;&s;acred, and their libraries burned. We have already ob&s;erved that the cruelty of the Danes was &s;o inveterate again&s;t every per&s;on apper|taining to the culture of the Chri&s;tian religion, that tho&s;e few monks who e&s;caped their barbarity, either quitted the kingdom, or had recour&s;e to other em|ployments for a livelihood, when they found them|&s;elves deprived of the revenues upon which they for|merly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; &s;o that <HI>Alfred</HI> the Great, when he triumphed over tho&s;e invaders, could find no monks in England, and was obliged to repleni&s;h the mona&s;|teries he built with eccle&s;ia&s;tics invited from foreign countries. This great prince, who contributed &s;o

In con&s;equence of the numerous and repeated attacks of that people, who were more barbarous than the Saxons, an almo&s;t univer&s;al ruin was &s;pread through the i&s;land, and the monks were totally di&s;per&s;ed, &s;o that the few among them that had applied them|&s;elves to u&s;eful learning, were driven away or mur|dered; the wi&s;dom they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, whatever it was, peri&s;hed with them.

<HEAD>ALFRED, A. D. 872.</HEAD>
<P>When the Danes had already &s;ubdued Northum|berland and Ea&s;t Anglia, and gained footing in the very heart of We&s;&s;ex, all the churches and mo|na&s;teries burnt, and the whole country depopulated, Alfred &s;ea&s;onably and &s;ucce&s;sfully a&s;&s;umed the dig|nity of King, and merited that of father to his people
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, p. 249.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Were it not for Alfred the period we are writing of would hardly de&s;erve to be mentioned;
<NOTE>Alfred's character.</NOTE> but he has thrown a mighty lu&s;tre upon it, for in him we meet with abilities and accompli&s;hments that are truly a&s;toni&s;hing. If we had materials, it would be very delightful to trace the &s;teps by which &s;uch a mind advanced to maturity, to mark the incidents that awakened the vigour of his genius, and rendered him &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed and en|lightened in a barbarous age, and amid&s;t a &s;cene of general di&s;cord. We are informed, that when he was very young, he was twice at Rome, and perhaps a per&s;ecuting impre&s;&s;ion might be made upon him, while in that famous city: for though Rome it&s;elf was then in an exceeding low &s;tate of &s;cience, compared with what it had formerly been; yet it was va&s;tly &s;uperior in this re&s;pect to the dark and frozen regions of the north. But whatever impre&s;&s;ions Alfred might receive at that place, no immediate advancement in knowledge &s;eems to have been the re&s;ult of them; for we are told his education was &s;o far neglected, that he did not learn to read till he was twelve years of age; but when he had made a beginning, his capacity and a&s;&s;i|duity was &s;uch, that his progre&s;s was equally &s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>He was undoubtedly in every in&s;tance one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious characters recorded in hi&s;tory, and de|&s;ervedly remains to this day the peculiar favourite of the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="440">With regard to his per&s;onal character, we &s;hall find that he was &s;uperior to any man of his time; con&s;i|dered as a poet and mathematician, &s;uch was his ar|dent de&s;ire for the cultivation of his mind, that he always retained about him the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed &s;cho|lars he could meet with, with whom he perpetually engaged in literary enquiries and pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>Nor was his wi&s;dom locked up in his own brea&s;t, and re&s;erved merely for his private entertainment, but was diffu&s;ed around him in a plentiful manner. He was extremely &s;olicitous to have his &s;ubjects enlighten|ed and improved; and &s;ought out methods that could contribute to &s;o de&s;irable an effect. For which pur|po&s;e, one of his fir&s;t &s;teps was to invite from the Bri|ti&s;h mona&s;teries, and from the continent, as many learn|ed men as po&s;&s;ible, whom he received and treated with great marks of friend&s;hip, and in concurrence with them erected a number of &s;chools for the in&s;truction of his people.</P>
<P>Among the learned &s;trangers who a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>Alfred</HI> in his great work of re&s;toring the lu&s;tre of the church, and reviv|ing the arts and &s;ciences, the principal were, Johannes Scotus Erigena, an Iri&s;h Scot, who had &s;tudied at Athens and other foreign countries, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Greek and oriental languages; he then repaired thro' Italy to France, where he acquired an eminent degree of favour and familiarity with Charles the Bald; and the fame of his talents extending to England, he was invited hither by Alfred, whom he in&s;tructed in the liberal arts, and who&s;e friend&s;hip he enjoyed, notwith|&s;tanding his oppo&s;ition to the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation, which rendered him obnoxious to the &s;ee of Rome. Towards the latter part of his life, he opened a &s;chool in the mona&s;tery of Malme&s;bury, where his &s;cholars murdered him with their penknives; though we are ignorant of the occa&s;ion. Another foreigner, for whom <HI>Al&s;red</HI> conceived a very early affection, was one <HI>Grimbald,</HI> who entertained him &s;o ho&s;pitably in
<PB N="296" REF="441">his journey to Rome, that he afterwards created him abbot of Winche&s;ter. He was a learned divine, well &s;killed in mu&s;ic, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for his ta|lents in oratory. The fir&s;t abbot of the new abbey, founded in the i&s;le of Ethelney, was a native of Old Saxony, and almo&s;t all the monks, prie&s;ts, and dea|cons were foreigners; not but that his own country produced a number of men who di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves by their piety and erudition, namely, <HI>A&s;&s;er Me|nevenis,</HI> a monk of St. David's, &s;o attached to his re|tirement, that all the care&s;&s;es and favours of Alfred could not prevail upon him to for&s;ake it entirely, though he con&s;ented to live one half-year with the King, who promoted him to the bi&s;hopric of Sher|burn, and be&s;towed upon him many other marks of his particular regard. Yet he mu&s;t not be confounded with his name-&s;ake and uncle, A&s;&s;erius, archbi&s;hop of St. David's, who wrote part of Alfred's life. <HI>John,</HI> the monk, belonging to the &s;ame mona&s;tery, to who&s;e in&s;truction the King owed his knowledge of the Latin tongue. <HI>Werefred,</HI> bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, who had been driven by the Danes into bani&s;hment; from whence he was recalled by Alfred, who had employed him to tran&s;late Gregory's Dialogues. <HI>Plegmund,</HI> arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury; and <HI>Dunwulf,</HI> bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, who is &s;aid by &s;ome authors to have been the very cow-herd whom <HI>Alfred</HI> &s;erved in di&s;gui&s;e. That prince it &s;eems di&s;covered in him a genius far above his &s;tation in life, which he exalted in proportion to his merit.</P>
<P>But of all the eccle&s;ia&s;tics who dignified the court of <HI>Alfred, Neotus,</HI> or St. <HI>Neot,</HI> was the mo&s;t remark|able for his learning, piety, and example: in being de&s;cended from the blood royal of the Ea&s;t-Angles, he was re&s;pected as a prince as well as a prelate; and is &s;aid, by his per&s;onal authority and admonitions, to have re&s;tricted the &s;allies of Alfred's youth. He was buried at St. Guerer's church, at Gain&s;bury, in
<PB N="297" REF="442">Cornwall; and &s;uch at that time was the general opinion of his &s;anctity, that he &s;upplanted the Corni&s;h &s;aint, and gave his own name to the church, which was thenceforward called <HI>Neot&s;tow.</HI> The palace of Earl Alric, in Huntingdon&s;hire, was afterwards con|verted into a mona&s;tery, and dedicated to this &s;aint, who&s;e body was tran&s;lated thither; though not &s;uffered to remain in this place neither, for, in the reign of King John, his bones were removed from this St. Neot to the abbey of Croyland. This eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e above-mentioned, taught together in the univer&s;ity of Oxford, which was regu|lated and endowed by Alfred, who frequently a&s;&s;i&s;ted in per&s;on at their exerci&s;es, until &s;ome di&s;putes aro&s;e between the native and foreign profe&s;&s;ors, and then Grimbald retired to the mona&s;tery at Winche&s;ter, which the King had lately founded
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Moreover, that the path of knowledge might be rendered &s;till ea&s;ier to the Engli&s;h nation, Alfred em|ployed the able&s;t per&s;ons who were about him, in writing &s;uch books as were calculated for the informa|tion of the multitude; a mo&s;t judicious and u&s;eful &s;cheme! and as there were but very few who were ca|pable of putting it into execution, he commenced au|thor him&s;elf, and compo&s;ed a variety of pieces; &s;o great a variety, that we are a&s;toni&s;hed at his finding lei&s;ure to produce them in the mid&s;t of the dangerous wars, and important public concerns, in which he was con|tinually engaged.</P>
<P>The motive from which his literary performances took their ri&s;e, does him honour: he did not write from a principle of vanity, but from a laudable view for the improvement and happine&s;s of mankind; and accordingly we find the matter of them were worthy of his character, as the prince and father of his country. Many of his compo&s;itions relate to the principles of government and laws; and others of them were calcu|lated
<PB N="298" REF="443">for the in&s;truction of his people in general, adapted to in&s;pire them with devotion, to excite their attention to the moral virtues, and to provide for them innocent and in&s;tructive entertainment. Nor &s;hould his method of doing it pa&s;s unnoticed, as he employed the learned about him to give the general &s;en&s;e of an author, and then gave it a dre&s;s be&s;t adapted to the ta&s;te and to the apprehen&s;ions of the public.</P>
<P>Nor did he confine his &s;ubjects to his own times, but in mo&s;t of his undertakings extended his views to the welfare of po&s;terity: be&s;ides the &s;chools erected by him in different places, he prohibited any one from a&s;&s;uming the tru&s;t and dignity of a magi&s;trate who was not ver&s;ed in learning; and, that there might not be wanting a &s;upply of men qualified to di&s;charge the &s;everal offices of government, he compelled, by law, tho&s;e who had competent fortunes to give their children a proper education.</P>
<P>One principal object which &s;hewed his regard to learning,
<NOTE>Univer&s;ity of Oxford founded by King Alfred.</NOTE> and has rendered his name peculiarly illu&s;trious, was his being the FOUNDER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD. We &s;ay the founder, though we are not in&s;en&s;ible that &s;ome writers have contended for a higher antiquity, but, we think, not &s;upported by &s;ufficient authority.</P>
<P>Alfred erected three halls, in each of which twenty-&s;ix &s;cholars were educated. The &s;ciences taught were divinity, logic, mu&s;ic, geometry, a&s;tronomy, gram|mar, and rhetoric; and the able&s;t men of the age were appointed the teachers. Such was the beginning of Oxford as a &s;eat of letters, and the re&s;idence of the mu&s;es; and &s;ince that time it hath ri&s;en to its utmo&s;t degree of &s;plendor, and has become the large&s;t univer|&s;ity in the world: it has no equal for the number and magnificence of its colleges and public buildings, the &s;ize and value of its libraries, the multitude of its pro|fe&s;&s;ors and pupils, and the variety of its endowments. It hath produced per&s;ons eminent in all branches of li|terature;
<PB N="299" REF="444">cla&s;&s;ical and polite learning have appeared in it with peculiar lu&s;tre; and it continues the habitation of &s;ub&s;tantial knowledge, true ta&s;te, and national in|&s;truction.</P>
<P>Alfred &s;hines with equal, perhaps with greater glo|ry as a legi&s;lator, than he doth as the friend and patron of letters in general; and not one of our Engli&s;h princes de&s;erve to be named with him in this re&s;pect: for, in order to provide for his &s;ubjects a full body of laws, he &s;earched into the in&s;titutions of foreign nations, col|lected the regulations of the Briti&s;h Kings, and of his Saxon ance&s;tors, and drew from them what was mo&s;t valuable and u&s;eful. It is much to be lamented that the code e&s;tabli&s;hed by him has not been tran&s;mitted to us entire; but enough of it remains to fill us with the warme&s;t veneration for his memory, and to convince us that he had the noble&s;t views for the happine&s;s of po&s;terity, as well as of his own times; and the natives of this i&s;land mu&s;t owe him peculiar e&s;teem, &s;ince to him we are indebted for many of the mo&s;t important privileges which, at the pre&s;ent day, con&s;titutes the dignity and felicity of our political con&s;titution
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Library, p. 183. Rapin's Hi&s;t. vol. I. p. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Moreover, with relation to his &s;kill in the arts, and his attention to commerce, he was &s;uperior to any monarch of the age: he erected cities, repaired pa|laces, and applied him&s;elf diligently to the &s;tudy of &s;hip-building, &s;o as to reduce it to a &s;cience, and in|vented ve&s;&s;els of &s;uch a con&s;truction as enabled him to obtain the victory in &s;everal engagements with the Danes. From a motive of piety, and to relieve the Chri&s;tians of Malabar, he &s;ent per&s;ons to the Ea&s;t-Indies, and his &s;hips returned home with precious &s;tones, perfumes, and other valuable commodities. It is likewi&s;e a certain fact, that he attempted the di&s;co|very of a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age, and employed <HI>Octhar,</HI> a Dane, and <HI>Wol&s;tan,</HI> an Engli&s;hman, for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="445">If we con&s;ider the religion of Alfred, though no doubt it partook of the temper of the times, yet we have no rea&s;on to believe that it was remarkably &s;u|per&s;titious: there is nothing recorded of him which favours of the mean and monki&s;h &s;pirit ob&s;ervable in many preceding and &s;ucceeding princes; his piety was ever &s;incere and fervent, and as rational as the period in which he lived would admit.</P>
<P>In <HI>Alfred</HI> we may behold what amazing effects may be produced by the genius and abilities of one man. Such was the influence he had upon the nation, that, in a few years, it was transformed into quite another people: the Engli&s;h, from being cowardly, poor, de|&s;picable, and ignorant, became brave, rich, re&s;pecta|ble, and, comparatively &s;peaking, knowing and polite; but they were governed by a prince who was almo&s;t a prodigy in every re&s;pect, and we mu&s;t travel through &s;everal centuries before we &s;hall find a character on which we can expatiate with equal plea&s;ure, and which does &s;o much honour to human nature.</P>
<P>Though Alfred was a prodigy, yet his own im|provements were much limited by the ignorance of the age; and he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be unacquainted with a thou&s;and things that are at pre&s;ent known by per&s;ons of very moderate capacities. This too was the ca&s;e with regard to the profe&s;&s;ors and tutors appointed by him at Oxford and other places; they had not accurate and exten&s;ive views of any &s;cience, and therefore could not communicate &s;uch views to their di&s;ciples. Indeed it was not po&s;&s;ible, in &s;o dark a period, to make a large progre&s;s in philo&s;ophy and &s;ound learning; the &s;tate of religion, the prevailing manners of the world, the want of good examples, all &s;tood in oppo&s;ition to the advancement of real wi&s;dom: add to this, that the repeated inva&s;ions of the Danes put a &s;top to the culti|vation of knowledge, and at length brought back an univer&s;al barbari&s;m. This great prince died in the fifty-&s;econd year of his age, October 26, A. D. 900.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD, A. D. 900.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Edward, Alfred</HI>'s &s;ucce&s;&s;or, imitated the virtues of his father in a number of benefactions to the church; yet his reign is remarkable for a very particular exer|tion of the authority of the Roman &s;ee. Pope For|mo&s;us being informed that the bi&s;hopric of We&s;&s;ex had been many years vacant, &s;ent over a bull, excom|municating the King, and all his &s;ubjects; which be|ing publickly read at a general a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, by Plegmund, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the vacant &s;ees were immediately filled, and three new bi&s;hoprics erected in We&s;&s;ex: then Plegmund &s;et out for Rome, where the &s;entence was revoked, and, at his return to England, he con&s;ecrated &s;even prelates in one day.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this in&s;tance of weakne&s;s, all hi&s;torians agree in be&s;towing high encomiums upon EDWARD, and in repre&s;enting him as not much inferior to his father. It is, however, but little which is &s;aid of his literary character; though enough to convince us that he was a man of abilities and under|&s;tanding. Perhaps we may con&s;ider as &s;ome proof of it, an u&s;eful and remarkable regulation he made, that if a &s;ervant was gui&s;ty of theft, the per&s;on who recom|mended him &s;hould be an&s;werable for his crime, and re&s;pon&s;ible for his right behaviour. We read al&s;o, that Edward was particularly careful in the education of his children: that, in con&s;equence of his attention in this re&s;pect, they were di&s;tingui&s;hed by their im|provements; and that his daughters were &s;o celebrated for their accompli&s;hments, as to be &s;ought after, and obtained in marriage, by the greate&s;t foreign princes, kings, and emperors.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="447">But the grand point which intitles him to a place in the hi&s;tory of letters, is his being generally looked up|on as the founder of the univer&s;ity of Cambridge. The fact, however, like other ancient facts, is not &s;o clear as to be wholly free from di&s;pute; while &s;ome go back to the fabulous ages, for the original of this famous &s;eminary; and &s;ome contend that it had no exi&s;tence as a &s;chool of learning, till the year 1110, in the reign of Henry I. But, without entering into the&s;e controver|&s;ies, we &s;hall only embrace the pre&s;ent opportunity of ob&s;erving, that, from &s;mall beginnings, Cambridge is become, in a cour&s;e of time, exceedingly illu&s;trious, and, in rank, the &s;econd univer&s;ity in the world. In|ferior to Oxford in magnitude, beauty, the number of colleges, buildings, profe&s;&s;ors, and &s;tudents, it is, not|with&s;tanding, capable of boa&s;ting many noble edifices and foundations.

<HEAD>ATHELSTAN, A. D. 925.</HEAD>
<P>After the death of King Edward, his elde&s;t &s;on ATHELSTAN was crowned at King&s;ton upon Thames, by Athelm, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. This ceremony of crowning and anointing the Engli&s;h Kings by &s;ome prelate was, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cording to Malme&s;bury, fir&s;t u&s;ed in the reign of King Alfred. Athel&s;tan &s;oon after his coronation began to enter upon action, and &s;hewed him&s;elf &s;uch an enterpri&s;ing and &s;ucce&s;sful prince, as gave great terror to many of his enemies, and to be e&s;teemed and care&s;&s;ed by foreigners, acquired &s;ome very advantageous alliances, procured honourable matches for his &s;i&s;ters; nay exceeded the bounds of the Engli&s;h limits, for he obliged the Kings of Scotland and Wales to re&s;ign their crowns to him; which he &s;oon after, as a prince of genero&s;ity, re&s;tored to them, upon doing him homage. Thus in civil affairs he gained applau&s;e; but all the glory of his atchieve|ments was eclip&s;ed by one act of inhumanity towards his brother Edwin; who being accu&s;ed of di&s;af|fection to his Maje&s;ty, he too ea&s;ily gave credit to it, bani&s;hed his brother, with circum&s;tances of cruelty highly aggravating, by putting him into a &s;hip with only one &s;ervant, without rigging or crew to &s;ail the ve&s;&s;el; and was driven by a &s;torm, which &s;oon after befel him, to &s;uch great di&s;tre&s;s, that he threw him&s;elf into the &s;ea. This precipitate act of Athel&s;tan &s;oon after &s;tung him with great remor&s;e, &s;o that to &s;ilence the accu&s;ations of his con&s;cience, he executed the per&s;on who informed him again&s;t his brother, and &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to &s;even years penance.</P>
<P>But neverthele&s;s Athel&s;tan is confe&s;&s;ed to have been a very illu&s;trious and accompli&s;hed prince, and is ju&s;tly ranked among the lawgivers of England. His eloquence is, likewi&s;e, highly extolled by hi&s;to|rians, who have been plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert that he was equal, in this re&s;pect, to the Roman orators. There
<PB N="304" REF="449">was a regulation made during this reign, that &s;hews an enlargement of mind much above the times, and which even more civilized ages have not been able to reach: it was, that a merchant who had effected three voyages to the Streights, on his own account, &s;hould be put on a footing with a gentleman. There is one fact related concerning Athel&s;tan, which, if &s;uf|ficiently authentical, would appear of peculiar impor|tance in a &s;urvey of literature. We are confidently told by &s;everal modern writers, that he ordered the Bible to be tran&s;lated out of the Hebrew into the Saxon language, for the benefit of his &s;ubjects. If this be true, it was a work of the utmo&s;t u&s;efulne&s;s and value, and &s;hews the in&s;titutions of Alfred to have produced very happy effects. But, notwith&s;tanding the improvements introduced by that prince, it is much to be que&s;tioned whether there were any per&s;ons in the kingdom capable of executing &s;o grand a de&s;ign; for, in the period we are &s;peaking of, the be&s;t &s;cholars Europe afforded &s;eem to have been totally unacquainted with the oriental tongues.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal &s;ynods, or rather mixed conven|tions of church and &s;tate held in this prince's reign. Sir Henry Spelman mentions four, but the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable was the &s;ynod at Graetly, A. D. 928. The principal con&s;titutions of which were,</P>

<P>By the preamble of the&s;e con&s;titutions it appears that the legi&s;lature in civil matters lay wholly on the King, and that the bi&s;hops and other great men were convened for their advice, and not to give any force or authority to the laws. But it is a &s;ad in&s;tance of the deficiency in their laws, and of the weakne&s;s of the legi&s;lature, that the fine for killing men was ac|cording to their rank; thus that of a duke was valued at 3000 thrim&s;a's
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thrim&s;a, a piece of the value of three &s;hillings.</NOTE>, a bi&s;hop or earl 8000, a prie&s;t 2000, and of a pea&s;ant 30 thrim&s;a's, or at mo&s;t but 100 &s;hillings. Athel&s;tan, however, made &s;ome very good laws, for the encouragement of a foreign trade, and died at Glouce&s;ter, A. D. 940.</P>
<P>From the days of Athel&s;tan, down to the conque&s;t, the &s;tate of knowledge evidently went backward, and the nation &s;unk into the depth of ignorance and &s;u|per&s;tition. Europe in general, during the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries, was over-run with ig|norance and barbarity; and England, if po&s;&s;ible, was &s;till in a wor&s;e condition. It is really painful to re|flect, that, in the cour&s;e of &s;everal hundred years, we meet with little worthy to be recorded. Like travellers in the de&s;erts of Arabia, we often &s;ee nothing for a long time together, but barren &s;ands; and if now and then we come to a verdant &s;pot, though that &s;pot is extremely beautiful, compared with the dreary pro|&s;pect around it, yet it partakes of the &s;terility of the &s;oil by which it is encompa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The di&s;putes that agitated the world were of too low and trifling a nature to merit a place in our work. The in&s;olent and fiery Dun&s;tan occa&s;ioned much bu&s;tle about the celibacy of the clergy; and how little they were engaged in literary pur&s;uits, appears from a
<PB N="306" REF="451">canon, enjoining every prie&s;t to learn &s;ome occupation as a handicraft&s;man; a regulation which, was circum|&s;tances &s;tood, might be exceedingly proper and rea|&s;onable. Another decree pre&s;cribes, that they &s;hall be capable of repeating the Creed and the <HI>Pater no&s;ter.</HI> In the reign, however, of Ethelred II. it is &s;aid, a mi&s;&s;ion was &s;ent to Norway, at the reque&s;t of the King of that country, to convert the Norwegians and the Swedes to the Chri&s;tian religion. The archbi&s;hop of York and other divines went over upon this occa|&s;ion, and had great &s;ucce&s;s, though &s;ome of them afterwards received the crown of martyrdom. What their real qualifications were, and what influence they had, we are not able to &s;ay; but may be well a&s;&s;ured their in&s;tructions were tinctured with the defects of the times.</P>
<P>While &s;o much darkne&s;s prevailed in the kingdom and every thing was gradually giving way to the pre|ten&s;ions of the Roman &s;ee, it ought not to be omitted, that the church of England had not as yet embraced the ab&s;urd and mon&s;trous doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation. This is evident from &s;everal te&s;timonies, and particularly from the writings of Alfric, who is the &s;ole per&s;on that de&s;erves to be mentioned for more than a century; and who is al&s;o remarkable for having drawn up a &s;et of homilies for the u&s;e of the clergy, now &s;o generally and totally ignorant, as to be utterly incapable of compo&s;ing di&s;cour&s;es for the benefit of their people. With re&s;pect, likewi&s;e, to the princes who &s;ucceeded Athel&s;tan, we meet with nothing but the reduction of the &s;everal Saxon &s;tatutes and cu&s;toms into one body, by Edward the Confe&s;&s;or; and an in|&s;titution of the &s;ame monarch, that &s;tudious men &s;hould be &s;ecure in their e&s;tates and properties: an in|&s;titution which contributed very little to the advance|ment of literature.</P>

<HEAD>EDMUND, A. D. 941.</HEAD>
<P>Edmund &s;ucceeded Athel&s;tan, when he was but eighteen years of age. The Northumbrians, perhaps de&s;pi&s;ing this prince's youth, broke their articles made with Athel&s;tan, and notwith&s;tanding the mediation made u&s;e of to reconcile the difference, Edmund was obliged to vindicate his right by the &s;word, and in the year 944 obtained a compleat victory over the Northumbrians, and &s;o far conquered the country as to annex it to his crown; the next year he gave Cum|berland to Malcolm King of the Scots upon the terms of homage, and that he &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the field, when ocea&s;ion required.</P>

<P>In the reign of Edmund a great &s;ynod was convoked at London,
<NOTE>Synod at London, A. D. <HI>944.</HI></NOTE> in which the bi&s;hops were enjoined to repair their churches, and the King required to e&s;ta|bli&s;h funds for their &s;upport. In the cour&s;e of the fol|lowing year, another a&s;&s;embly enacted con&s;titutions for the advancement of the Chri&s;tian religion, and the maintainance of concord among the people. Here al&s;o churches and royal palaces were made places of &s;anctuary; and it was ordained, that no mulct for breaking the peace, or &s;atisfaction for murder, &s;hould be accepted. About this period the famous Dun&s;tan began to &s;ignalize him&s;elf in the church and &s;tate. He
<PB N="308" REF="453">was by birth a We&s;t-Saxon, de&s;cended of a noble fa|mily, and educated at Gla&s;tonbury, under a learned Iri&s;h monk, who in&s;tructed youth in that mona&s;tery. Having made extraordinary progre&s;s in his &s;tudies, he was recommended by Adhelm, archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, to King Athel&s;tan, who took him under his protection; but no &s;ooner perceiving his ambitious views, and meddling di&s;po&s;ition, than he di&s;carded him from his court. It was then that Dun&s;tan retired in di&s;gu&s;t from the world, and conceived that affection for the monks which he &s;o cordially expre&s;&s;ed in the whole cour&s;e of his future greatne&s;s. Edmund, at his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, invited him from his retreat, and made him his confe&s;&s;or; but he was for &s;ome mi&s;demeanor di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from this office, which, however, he regained by dint of intere&s;t, and acquired amazing influence under this monarch and his brother Edred. This mo|na&s;tic life was at the &s;ame time dignified by an illu&s;tri|ous member in the per&s;on of Turketyl, who was an ex|cellent &s;oldier and &s;ound politician, and quitted the of|fice of chancellor to embrace the life of a reclu&s;e, at Croyland, of which he was made abbot, after having received the habit, together with the epi&s;copal bene|diction and pa&s;toral &s;taff. He was no &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical office, than he re&s;igned the mo|na&s;tery, with all its deeds, to Edred, who afterwards re&s;tored them to Turketyl and his monks, in a full a&s;|&s;embly of the &s;tates at London, whom he exempted from all &s;ervice and incumbrances, and confirmed all the former privileges of the mona&s;tery, except that of its being a &s;anctuary, which the abbot wi&s;ely re|fu&s;ed.</P>

<P>Edred, brother to Edmund, and third &s;on to Ed|ward the Elder, &s;ucceeded to the crown. This was an interruption to the right line, for the late King left two &s;ons, Edwy and Edgar; but being both very

<P>With regard to religion, Edred's con&s;cience was in a manner governed by Dun&s;tan, in&s;omuch that he &s;ubmitted to great au&s;terities at his direction, and was &s;ent for as his confe&s;&s;or, in his la&s;t illne&s;s, to give him ab&s;olution. He died A. D. 955.</P>

<HEAD>EDWY, A. D. 955.</HEAD>
<P>Edwy was elected King by the &s;uffrages of the clergy and nobility.

The King had married a very beautiful lady, named Aelgivia; but the match was &s;o contrary to the opinion of the bi&s;hops and nobles, as gave ri&s;e to a &s;eries of troubles, and his foundne&s;s for her
<PB N="310" REF="455">greatly weakened the authority of the bi&s;hops over him; for after dinner, on the day of his coronation, Edwy withdrew to an apartment where his wife was, which gave great offence to the bi&s;hops and the nobi|lity, and the archbi&s;hop commanded him to be fetched back again, and, though every body el&s;e refu&s;ed, Dun&s;tan was ready enough to obey Odo's order, who, reproaching him for his fondne&s;s, dragged him to his company. Such an outrage could not fail to ex|cite the re&s;entment of the young monarch and the King's friends, who were offended at the overbearing pride of the abbot; and &s;oon after Edwy demanded a re&s;titution of the &s;ums which Edred had committed to his charge, and &s;trongly in&s;inuated that he had em|bezzled the public money.

<P>Odo, the archbi&s;hop, thinking the dignity of the prie&s;thood degraded by the exile of Dun&s;tan, &s;o|mented a di&s;affection: the Mercians and Northum|brians entered into mea&s;ures with the archbi&s;hop; they rebelled, &s;et up Edwy's younger brother Edgar, a boy of thirteen years of age, for their King, who recalled Dun&s;tan, and immediately ordained him a bi&s;hop, to give him a &s;eat in that a&s;&s;embly, who made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to glo&s;s over this oppo&s;ition, or rebellion, with the name of religion, for which many pretended miracles were atte&s;ted to &s;upport their unwarrantable proceedings.

<HEAD>EDGAR, A. D. 959.</HEAD>
<P>Edwy dying without i&s;&s;ue, the whole kingdom was reunited under Edgar, who, though in the prime of his youth, had already given undeniable proofs of a &s;hining genius, and the mo&s;t &s;olid under&s;tanding. He had manife&s;ted his ability in making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of a part of his brother's dominions; and he afterwards demon|&s;trated the exten&s;ivene&s;s of his capacity, by keeping his &s;ubjects in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and his enemies in fear, without &s;training the regal authority, or engaging in any mar|tial enterprize: but he awed his neighbours by taking &s;uch mea&s;ures, for the defence of his kingdom, as di&s;abled them from invading it with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. He divided Northumberland into two go|vernments, and con&s;tantly maintained a &s;trong body of forces in the northern provinces, that they might be at hand to quell any in&s;urrection that &s;hould happen among the turbulent people; and in order to &s;ecure his dominions from the di&s;contents of foreign Danes, he equipped a very &s;trong fleet, amounting to two thou&s;and five hundred ve&s;&s;els, divided into dif|ferent &s;quadrons, and &s;tationed in &s;uch a manner that they were continually crui&s;ing round the i&s;land, which was thus effectually covered from in&s;ult. Such wi&s;e precautions could not fail to e&s;tabli&s;h peace and tran|quillity among his people, which, in order to fix be|yond any probability of interruption, he engaged Ken|nett, King of Scotland, in his intere&s;t, by ceding to him the whole county of Lothian, extending from the Tweed to the Forth, for which, and the northern coun|ties already be&s;towed upon Malcolm, that prince cer|tainly did homage. It was, in all probability, owing to this ce&s;&s;ion and treaty, which &s;ecured the Scotti&s;h King as an ally, that Maccu&s;e, King of Man and
<PB N="312" REF="457">the i&s;les, &s;ome monarchs of Galloway, and the Prince of Wales, &s;ubmitted &s;o peaceably to the government of Edgar.</P>
<P>The next year Edgar, being at Che&s;ter, &s;ummoned all the tributary knights to attend him at that place, who rowed his barge down the river Dee, in his way to the mona&s;tery of St. John the Bapti&s;t, while he him|&s;elf &s;at at the helm. Smollet con&s;iders this circum&s;tance as no more than a compliment, or frolic, acted in an excur&s;ion of plea&s;ure; when it is evident, from the King's behaviour, that it was a real act of homage: nor can his remark, that his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors might ju&s;tly boa&s;t of them&s;elves to be Kings of England, when at|tended in that manner, be under&s;tood in any other light.</P>
<P>Edgar did not think it &s;ufficient to protect England from the in&s;ults of foreigners, but he turned his thoughts to &s;ome regulations that were nece&s;&s;ary in the &s;tate, and then in the church. The fir&s;t was in re&s;pect to the magi&s;trates, of whom there was a general com|plaint; and that he might be better effect his pur|po&s;e, he every year made a vi&s;it to &s;ome part of his kingdom, to have the be&s;t accounts he could obtain of the conduct of his judges, &amp;c.; and to remove the abu&s;es complained of, he enacted, that every magi&s;|trate, convicted of giving a &s;entence contrary to law, if through ignorance, &s;hould be fined one hundred and twenty &s;hillings; but if knowingly, &s;hould be turned out, and rendered incapable of acting for the future. We mu&s;t acknowledge this care worthy of a prince, as it was a proper expedient for re&s;toring &s;uch a regard to ju&s;tice as is the &s;ecurity of the rights of &s;ubjects, and the authority of government
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin, vol. I. p. 127.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another wi&s;e regulation was, the reducing all weights and mea&s;ures to one &s;tandard: this he found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the credit of the kingdom in fo|reign markets, in which re&s;pect he acquired the prai&s;es
<PB N="313" REF="458">be&s;towed on him by ancient hi&s;torians: nay, we may go further; we may boldly &s;ay, that he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them, ina&s;much as they obtained their fame by acts of ra|pine, and the de&s;truction of their &s;pecies; whereas Edgar's fame was built upon a noble foundation, that of ju&s;tice and benevolence
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rider, vol. I. p. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides every in&s;tance of his great wi&s;dom in regard to civil affairs, he appears to be piou&s;ly di&s;|po&s;ed: it is &s;aid he founded forty mona&s;teries; that he repaired and embelli&s;hed a great number, among others that of Gla&s;ton, founded by Edred his uncle. Ingul|phus, in his hi&s;tory of Croyland, &s;ays the trea&s;ure of that mona&s;tery, in the reign of Edgar, amounted to no le&s;s than ten thou&s;and pounds, be&s;ides the ve&s;|&s;els, &s;hrines, and other things. Edgar not only en|riched the mona&s;teries, but undertook to e&s;tabli&s;h the monks a &s;econd time in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, which he performed with a high hand. This was &s;aid to be effected principally at the per&s;ua&s;ion of Dun&s;tan, whom Edgar had made archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury; and it is highly probable that Edgar him&s;elf thought he did a &s;ignal &s;ervice to the church by putting it under the direction of monks. Dun&s;tan, in con|junction with him, profe&s;&s;ed to bring about a reforma|tion in the inferior clergy; for this purpo&s;e a council was convened, and Edgar him&s;elf was pre&s;ent. At this council, the &s;peech he made plainly &s;hews how much he was bia&s;&s;ed in favour of the monks, and di&s;covered his great di&s;like of the &s;ecular clergy, on account of their immoralities.

<P>Immediately after the decea&s;e of Edgar, Elfser, Duke of Mercia, &s;worn enemy to the monks, expelled them from all the benefices in his country, which he filled again with &s;ecular prie&s;ts. Some other noble|men followed his example in different parts of the

This diver&s;ity of &s;entiments produced a conte&s;t concerning the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. Elfrida, their queen-dowager, a woman of an ambitious &s;pirit, had, by her emi&s;&s;aries, circulated &s;ome doubts about the validity of Edgar's marriage with the mother of Edward, in hopes of rai&s;ing her own &s;on, Ethelred, to the throne; and as the other was &s;upported by Dun&s;tan, all that prelate's enemies declared for the &s;on of Elfrida. Though by the&s;e means there was a very powerful faction formed in his favour, the archbi&s;hop, confiding in his great popula|rity, aro&s;e from the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, while they were deliberating upon the choice of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Edgar, and taking prince Edward by the hand, con|ducted him to the church, where he was anointed and con&s;ecrated, in the twelfth year of his age, amid&s;t a va&s;t concour&s;e of people, who te&s;tified their joy in loud acclamations.</P>
<P>Whatever inclinations the oppo&s;ite party felt to con|trovert this irregular way of proceeding, they would not run the ri&s;k of di&s;obliging the multitude, but left Edward in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne; while his &s;tepmother, Elfrida, retired to Corf-Ca&s;tle, in Dor|&s;et&s;hire, which was a&s;&s;igned her dowry, and there in &s;ecret hatched &s;chemes for his de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Dun&s;tan having thus &s;ecured the continuance of his own power, exerted all his endeavours to maintain the monks in the benefices they had acquired in the pre|ceding reign, which he endeavoured to &s;upport by pretended miracles.</P>
<P>Edward however called a &s;ynod at Ame&s;bury, in Wilt&s;hire, in which &s;everal canons were made with a de&s;ign to bring the province to a nearer conformity with the Roman church. Be&s;ides the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical

<P>Such was the di&s;po&s;ition and inexperience of this prince, that we find the reins of government were greatly relaxed, and all the nece&s;&s;ary precautions for the &s;ecu|rity of the kingdom entirely neglected: the principal nobility who had been entru&s;ted with the government of different counties, perpetuated the admini&s;tration in their families, a&s;&s;umed the name of dukes, exerci&s;ed an independent authority in their own di&s;tricts, and di&s;regarded that union, upon which alone the &s;afety and welfare of the nation could depend. The Danes took advantage of it to renew their depredations on the kingdom, and Ethelred &s;eeing his realm reduced to a mi&s;erable &s;ituation, obeyed the dectates of his fears and de&s;pondence, and &s;ubmitted to pay thirty thou&s;and pounds to tho&s;e invaders; upon which many of the Danes retired to their own country. But a good num|ber of them cho&s;e to fix their habitation in England; where being &s;upported by the natives of the &s;ame race, they became extremely in&s;olent and oppre&s;&s;ive. In &s;hort, we find nothing intere&s;ting in the reign of this prince of a civil or religious nature; for at the beginning of it he found a rich and flouri&s;hing kingdom, which he left in extreme poverty. He died after a &s;hort illne&s;s, in the thirty-&s;eventh year of his reign, A. D. 1016.</P>

<HEAD>EDMUND II. <HI>&s;urnamed</HI> Iron&s;ide, A. D. 1016.</HEAD>
<P>On the death of Ethelred, the citizens of London immediately proclaimed Edmund, his elde&s;t &s;on, by Ethelgiva, his fir&s;t wife. This young prince was of a con&s;titution &s;o remarkably &s;trong, that he acquired the &s;urname of Iron&s;ide. The many &s;ignal proofs of his courage and conduct contributed to his election at this juncture. And Livignus, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, crowned him &s;oon after. But the re&s;t of the bi&s;hops and nobility being &s;ummoned by Canute to Southamp|ton, declared for him, and &s;olemnly renounced the race of Ethelred. After the Dane had taken an oath, that he would govern them faithfully in matters, both &s;ecular and religious, after many conte&s;ts and &s;truggles for the crown, Edmund was induced to open a con|ference on the &s;ubject of peace, in order to prevent any farther effu&s;ion of blood. This propo&s;al being eagerly embraced by both parties, a treaty was concluded, in which this kingdom was divided between the two competitors; all the country to the &s;outh of the Thames and part of We&s;&s;ex was a&s;&s;igned to Edmund, and all the re&s;t of the i&s;land ceded to Canute. After the ratification of the treaty, by the perfidy of Edric, or &s;ome other per&s;on, in which hi&s;torians are not agreed, Edmund was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated before he had opportunity to di&s;play his virtues. However; he ap|pears to have been a per&s;on of &s;trict ju&s;tice, great be|nevolence, &s;ublime genero&s;ity, intrepid courage, and invincible patience; though the&s;e virtues were ob&s;cured by the weakne&s;s he &s;hewed in admitting Edric into fa|vour, notwith&s;tanding he had been the ruin of his fa|ther by his treachery.</P>

<HEAD>CANUTE <HI>the</HI> GREAT, A. D. 1017.</HEAD>
<P>As &s;oon as Canute heard of the murder of Edmund, he convened a general council of all the nobility and clergy at London, in order to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the whole kingdom. When the a&s;&s;embly was met, he artfully availed him&s;elf of the la&s;t treaty he had made with the late King, and it was not without much difficulty he pre&s;erved his kingly authority. We &s;hall not enter upon the civil part of his hi&s;tory and cha|racter; it is acknowledged by &s;ome hi&s;torians, that no King ever de&s;erved a more contradictory character, nor that any admini&s;tration produced a greater variety of conduct: he di&s;covered an ambition that regarded nothing but the accompli&s;hments of his wi&s;hes: even the acts of &s;uper&s;tition, which he performed to atone for his former cruelties, may be &s;u&s;pected to be incited by policy, and tinctured with ambition. The gran|deur of his expedition to Rome, and the large &s;ums he expended there, may be charged with o&s;tentation, if not with profu&s;ion. Yet, with all his faults, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great virtues, and was certainly a per&s;on of great abilities. He &s;eemed to have been well acquainted with mankind, and able to turn the various di&s;po&s;itions of his &s;ubjects to his advantage. Scarce any monarch ever rai&s;ed popular odium &s;o high, or allayed it &s;o effectually as Canute; but in the latter part of his reign he paid a much greater regard to the intere&s;t and to the e&s;teem of his &s;ubjects. The variety of his victories did not &s;o entitle him to the epithet of Great, as the virtues which he practi&s;ed during the peaceable interval of his admini&s;tration. It was in that period that he mani|fe&s;ted his piety, his charity, and his equity: his con|tinence was great, his addre&s;s engaging, his affability remarkable, his mercy exten&s;ive: his love of peace manife&s;ted it&s;elf in his encouragement of tho&s;e who
<PB N="319" REF="464">were of a pacific di&s;po&s;ition, and his &s;trict regard to ju&s;tice in his &s;everity to tho&s;e who were guilty of any acts of robbery or violence. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">der concern he had for the welfare and pro&s;perity of the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects, is evident from many of his letters to his officers; and, during the calm of peace, he applied his thoughts to the &s;ublime &s;tudy of legi&s;lation, and, by the number of his laws, &s;eemed to have made it his &s;tudy to leave no grievance without redre&s;s. For the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, he ordered that no di&s;tinction &s;hould be made between rich and poor, and recommends mercy in all deci&s;ions; that no per&s;on &s;hould be put to death for a &s;mall offence; and in ca&s;e any judge perverted judgment out of prejudice, or for the &s;ake of lucre, he was to be fined the value of his head

Per&s;ons guilty of con|&s;piracy again&s;t the King were puni&s;hed with lo&s;s of life; and the demoli&s;hing or burning hou&s;es, theft, and murder, were declared to be &s;uch offences for which no &s;atisfaction could be made by way of mulct and compen&s;ation. The regulations he pre&s;cribed with re|&s;pect to married per&s;ons, were highly conducive to make that &s;tate re&s;pectable, and to prevent incon|tinence.</P>
<P>The eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, enacted by this monarch, are not le&s;s curious than the civil, and &s;hew that he extended his concern, not only to the &s;ecular, but like|wi&s;e to the &s;piritual welfare of his kingdom; and with this view he enacted, that no fairs, markets, or other &s;ecular affairs, &s;hould be practi&s;ed on the Lord's day. All Chri&s;tians were obliged to receive the euchari&s;t, or the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper, three times a year. And in order to oblige his clergy to live &s;uita|ble to their character, and to &s;hew they were not ex|empted by their order from the civil juri&s;diction, he enacted, that if a prie&s;t was guilty of murder, or

<HEAD>EDWARD <HI>the</HI> Confe&s;&s;or, A. D. 1042.</HEAD>
<P>The Engli&s;h had &s;uffered &s;o much from the Danes, during the reign of &s;ome late kings, that there was a general in&s;urrection, and they intended to drive all the Danes out of the kingdom; but at length a council was held at Gillingham for the election of a king; and Earl Godwin, a per&s;on of great influence, remem|bering his promi&s;e to Edward, took him along with him incog. to the meeting. After a long harrangue which the Earl made in favour of the prince, he rai&s;ed him in the mid&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly, &s;aying at the &s;ame time, "Behold your King." The a&s;&s;embly being &s;taggered at &s;o unexpected an event, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, they agreed to elect Edward for their &s;overeign; and, to give &s;anction to their choice, Earl Godwin was the fir&s;t who did him homage.</P>
<P>Edward, being thus &s;ettled upon his throne, could not help &s;hewing the fondne&s;s he had contracted for the Norman cu&s;toms; during his exile he invited over &s;everal of that nation, and behaved towards the&s;e fo|reigners with a partiality that gave great di&s;gu&s;t to the Engli&s;h nobility: he even carried his regard to &s;uch a height as was both impolitic and unju&s;t; the mo&s;t important fortre&s;&s;es, and the greate&s;t po&s;ts in the
<PB N="322" REF="467">kingdom, were conferred on the Normans; and the &s;ee of Canterbury being vacant, it was filled by one Rodbert a monk; he &s;oon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Edward with a high opinion of his capacity and integrity, and en|gro&s;&s;ed his confidence. Godwin finding the ear of the King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a foreigner, was apprehen&s;ive that his ma&s;ter might be led to &s;uch mea&s;ures as were in|con&s;i&s;tent with the good of the kingdom; he therefore endeavoured, but in vain, to remove the prelate from the place he held in the King's e&s;teem; but the King was not a little exa&s;perated at the conduct of Godwin. The Iri&s;h taking advantage of the un&s;ettled &s;tate of the nation, meditated a de&s;cent, which was attended with &s;ome dreadful con&s;equences. At length a council was convened, and Godwin and his &s;ons, who had fled to Ireland, and promoted the animo&s;ity of the Iri&s;h, were neverthele&s;s acquitted of every crime laid to their charge, rein&s;tated in their honours and prefer|ments, and re&s;tored to the King's favour. Many other quarrels and conte&s;ts took place in this King's reign, which being foreign to my de&s;ign I &s;hall omit. The King at length, worn out with years, and unable to perform the vow which he had made of going a pilgrimage to Rome, obtained the Pope's di&s;pen&s;ation, on condition of his building the abbey of We&s;tmin&s;ter. This noble &s;tructure, which &s;till goes by the &s;ame name, was originally the temple of Apollo, and was by King Sebert turned into a Chri&s;|tian church; during the deva&s;tations of the Danes, it was de&s;troyed and laid in ruins, till Edward rebuilt it, for the rea&s;on already a&s;&s;igned. A general council of the nation was called to confirm the King's charter, who exempted it from all epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, and granted it the privilege of a &s;anctuary. The dedication of this &s;acred edifice engro&s;&s;ed all Edward's thoughts, and the officiou&s;ne&s;s he &s;hewed on that occa&s;ion very probably threw him into the fever, which was the occa&s;ion of his death. The monks gave him the
<PB N="323" REF="468">glorious titles of Saint and Confe&s;&s;or; but it would have been with much better grace, if his public or private virtues had ever been &s;o con&s;picuous as to de&s;erve them. The tranquillity of his reign was certainly re|markable, if we con&s;ider the factions which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among his nobles; &s;ome have repre&s;ented him as void of all pa&s;&s;ion, and attribute much to that evenne&s;s and &s;erenity of temper; but they &s;hould rather have &s;aid he was void of all the &s;ocial affections; his treatment of his wife and mother would ju&s;tify &s;uch a charge, nay they even extort it. His cha&s;tity, which the monks have applauded &s;o highly as to found his merits of being canonized thereupon, was it not owing to natural frigidity, is &s;uch a violation of the marriage|vow as ought to tran&s;mit eternal infamy on his me|mory
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voltaire ob&s;erves on this occa&s;ion, that one of the great faults, or great misfortunes of this King, was his having no children by his wife, daughter to one of the mo&s;t powerful noblemen of his king|dom: he hated his wife as well as his own mother, and for rea&s;ons of &s;tate had them both removed from court. However the barren|ne&s;s of the marriage-bed proved the occa&s;ion of his canonization, for it was pretended that he had made a vow of cha&s;tity; a ra&s;h vow &s;urely, for a married man, and highly ab&s;urd for a King, who &s;tood in need of an heir to his dominions; but by this vow, real or pretended, he forged new chains for his country."

<P>Hi&s;torians are much divided in their opinion as to the right of Harold to the crown, and the manner of his acce&s;&s;ion to it. Harold had no legal claim to the crown by any hereditary right, nor, as we find, by the will of Edward. But without entering into the merits of the di&s;pute, Henry de Silgrave relates, that Harold came to Edward as he was lying on his death-bed, de&s;iring him to appoint a &s;ucce&s;&s;or; that he replied he had already nominated Duke William for his heir; but the Earland his friends &s;till per&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in this reque&s;t, the King turning his face to the wall, replied, "When

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This author wrote in the time of Edward I. his hi&s;tory is now in manu&s;cript in the Cottonian collection, marked Cleopatra, A12, cited by Ryder.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Harold however u&s;ed his intere&s;t with &s;uch dexterity, as to get him&s;elf crowned, and began his admini&s;tra|tion with many popular acts of government; he paid great deference to the clergy, without &s;hutting his eyes to the irregularities of that order, &s;everely cha&s;ti|&s;ing the guilty, while he be&s;towed marks of his favour upon the innocent, by confirming their charters and extending their immunities; he took the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures for the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, ordered the laws to be revived and reformed, and ex|amplary puni&s;hments to be inflicted on robbers and di&s;turbers of the public peace; and being alarmed with the news of the preten&s;ions of William Duke of Normandy to the crown, he fortified &s;ome of his territories and ports.</P>
<P>The Duke of Normandy, though well informed of all the&s;e popular tran&s;actions of Harold, would not de&s;i&s;t from his enterprize; and even &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to demand that Harold would relinqui&s;h the crown in his favour, and to denounce war in ca&s;e of refu&s;al. To this peremptory demand Harold replied, that William had no &s;ort of right to the crown of England; for, granting that the late King had di&s;po&s;ed of it in his favour, &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition (if any &s;uch there was) could not take place, ina&s;much as it was diametrically oppo&s;ite to the laws of the kingdom; which re&s;tricted Kings from be&s;towing their crowns according to their own caprice, e&s;pecially to &s;trangers. With re&s;pect to him&s;elf, he had been fairly elected by tho&s;e who had a right to confer the &s;overeignty; nor could he yield the crown to any other, without betraying the confidence repo&s;ed in him by his &s;ubjects; finally, he gave him to under&s;tand, that he knew how to defend his right
<PB N="327" REF="472">again&s;t any per&s;on by whom he &s;hould be invaded: an an&s;wer, that referred the di&s;pute to the determination of war; for which both parties prepared with the utmo&s;t diligence.</P>
<P>William the Norman accordingly embarked at St. Valery towards the latter end of September, and after a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age landed at Peven&s;ey in Su&s;&s;ex; after having refre&s;hed his men, he advanced along the &s;ea|&s;ide to Ha&s;tings, where he ordered a fort to be built, and publi&s;hed a manife&s;to. But though he pretended that he came to revenge the death of Alfred, re&s;tore the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, a&s;&s;i&s;t the Engli&s;h in puni&s;hing Harold, who had &s;eized the crown without having any right to it (but made no mention of Ed|ward's will) the&s;e rea&s;ons appeared &s;o tri&s;ling, that no Engli&s;hman would inli&s;t under his banner; how|ever, he forbad his people to ravage the country, or in&s;ult the inhabitants, whom he was plea&s;ed to term his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Harold was at York when he received the news of this inva&s;ion, and forthwith began his march to Lon|don with the troops that had returned from the north; and whil&s;t he was in London, waiting for &s;ome troops that were on their march to join him, and receiving the profe&s;&s;ions of the nobility in his favour, William &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to him with another threatening me&s;|&s;age, which Harold retorted by another emba&s;&s;y of the &s;ame nature. Some propo&s;als were made for the bat|tle being conducted by his brother Gurth. But Ha|rold bravely replied in the negative, and that he would by his per&s;onal behaviour convince his &s;ubjects he was worthy of the crown they had &s;et upon his head.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h monarch having a&s;&s;embled all his forces, advanced again&s;t the Norman army, and encamped within &s;even miles of Ha&s;tings, where they remained at &s;ome little di&s;tance from each other; and the Duke made &s;ome overtures, by one of his monks, to refer the di&s;pute to the determination of the Pope, to quit the
<PB N="328" REF="473">kingdom, if he would do him homage for the crown, or decide it by a &s;ingle combat. To the&s;e propo&s;itions Harold replied, that he was not &s;o &s;imple as to &s;ubmit to the arbitration of the Pope, who had already de|clared him&s;elf a party; that he &s;corned to hold the crown of England dependent on any prince what&s;oever, nor would he put his kingdom on the i&s;&s;ue of a &s;ingle combat, in which, though he &s;hould obtain the victory, he could reap no &s;olid advantage; he therefore told the me&s;&s;enger, God would next day decide between him and his adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>The fatal day being come, the fourteenth of Oc|tober, both armies appeared in array, each of them con&s;i&s;ting of about &s;ixty thou&s;and, both commanded by men of intrepid valour; and &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes hap|pened that day, without any remarkable advantage gained on either &s;ide. William perceiving the night ap|proaching, and unwilling to leave the battle undecided, made another de&s;perate effort to di&s;lodge the enemy; and in this attack Harold was &s;hot dead with an arrow that pierced his brain.</P>
<P>Thus fell the brave, but unfortunate prince Harold II. with his &s;word drawn in defence of Engli&s;h liberty, and was with his brother Gurth and Lewin &s;ent to their mother Githa, and were honourably interred in the abbey at Waltham, which Harold him&s;elf had founded.</P>
<P>Some hi&s;torians have endeavoured to blacken Ha|rold's character, particularly for &s;uper&s;eding prince Edgar, who had the greate&s;t right to the throne. The impartial will, perhaps, acknowledge Harold would have been more worthy of the crown, had he been le&s;s anxious to obtain it; for while he was a private man, he won the love and e&s;teem of his fellow-&s;ubjects: nor could any action of his reign, which was not a year, forfeit that e&s;teem and affection, e&s;pecially as he had &s;hewn a regard to the Briti&s;h liberties and intere&s;t by two battles, which he fought in a &s;hort &s;pace. By one
<PB N="329" REF="474">of them he obtained a &s;ignal victory over the Norwegi|ans, and the unhappy i&s;&s;ue of the la&s;t was never attri|buted to his want of courage or conduct. In fine, he was as far, perhaps as the nature and perplexity of his affairs permitted, well di&s;po&s;ed with re&s;pect to religion, always liberal to the church, and the friend of the clergy: but in the &s;ocial and relative virtues few exceeded him; he was humane, mild, affable, and generous, &s;uch as made his character amiable, as a hu&s;band, a parent, and a friend.</P>

<P>As the <HI>laws</HI> and <HI>con&s;titution</HI> of Great Britain owe their origin to the principal tran&s;actions and revoluti|ons of the Saxon heptarchy, &amp;c. the following review of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting periods relative hereto may not be unacceptable to the reader.</P>
<P>When the Picts and Scots had jointly invaded the Britons, who had not &s;pirit to &s;tand up in their own de|fence, but applied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Saxons, who had rendered them&s;elves a formidable people, and took the Britons under their protection, only to gratify their ambition and increa&s;e their power and intere&s;t; the Saxons invaded Gaul, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the kingdom of France in 420; after which they came over to Britain, and founded the kingdom of England in 445.</P>
<P>When the Engli&s;h and French came from Germany to people Britain and Gaul, they tran&s;planted with them the moderate &s;way and liberty of the Germans. They were at this time Pagans; but they were &s;oon converted to chri&s;tianity, and e&s;tabli&s;hed that excellent government, which, under &s;everal improvements, has been conveyed down to the pre&s;ent age: but they met with &s;ome difficulties in forming their &s;ettlements, nor could they find any footing, without fir&s;t clearing their way, and driving the Britons up by them&s;elves into a
<PB N="330" REF="475">corner of the i&s;land, where they continued till the year 1212, before they were incorporated with England.</P>
<P>The Saxon form of government was rather ari&s;tocra|tical than monarchical; and they were di&s;tingui&s;hed into the three ranks of noblemen, freemen, and &s;laves. Hengi&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed the kingdom of Kent in 455; and the heptarchy, after &s;ome confu&s;ion, was formed in 582. The&s;e &s;even kingdoms were con&s;idered as one grand &s;tate or confederacy; and the command of their armies was given to one prince, cho&s;en out of the re&s;t, on whom &s;ome hi&s;torians have peculiarly be&s;towed the title of monarch, as having the precedence and &s;ome &s;uperiority over the others. The Saxon revolution was entire, as far as it extended: they introduced their language with their government; and the&s;e together with their cu&s;toms have de&s;cended to their po&s;terity, increa&s;ed by other engraftments on the original &s;tock. Their <HI>Wittenagemot</HI> was like our parliament, of which it is the &s;ource, where they deliberated upon the com|mon affairs of the &s;even kingdoms; and every king|dom was &s;ubject to the re&s;olutions of the general a&s;|&s;embly. But it is hard to trace how regularly they moved as to civil affairs, how clo&s;ely they followed their country-cu&s;toms, or where they innovated or varied from their German forms and policy. Some foot&s;teps are however di&s;coverable, which have remained to po|&s;terity; as the divi&s;ions of the country into hundreds; the appointing of &s;heriffs, and electing annual magi|&s;trates by the people; as al&s;o the juri&s;diction and power of life and death by juries. The whole fabric of this government was &s;olid and magnificent, equally con|ducive to the honour of the prince, and the &s;ecurity of the &s;ubjects: but it is in England only that this an|tient generous manly government of Europe &s;urvives, and continues in its original perfection.</P>
<P>After the formation of the heptarchy, the mo|narchs of the different kingdoms, each in their turn, a&s;pired at the government of the whole, which occa|&s;ioned
<PB N="331" REF="476">&s;everal wars among the Saxons, who freely &s;hed their bloods, but carefully pre&s;erved their liberties. It is remarkable, that the Saxons who &s;ettled in Britain acknowledged an hereditary right in the female line; while tho&s;e who &s;ettled in France, aboli&s;hed it there by the Salique law: but Pharamond &s;ubdued Gaul by conque&s;t, and Hengi&s;t planted him&s;elf in Britain by policy.</P>
<P>The kingdom of the We&s;t Saxons was the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable among the heptarchy, and was founded by Cerdic in 495. Sexburgha, an excellent prince&s;s, go|verned this kingdom in 672; and Ina began his reign in 690, who publi&s;hed a body of laws, intitled, <HI>We&s;t Saxon Lege,</HI> or the laws of We&s;t Saxons, whereby he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as the fir&s;t Saxon prince, who regularly &s;ummoned a great council or parliament, to enact laws for the better government of his kingdom; for none of their Kings had the power of making laws, without the con&s;ent of the general a&s;&s;embly of the na|tion, compo&s;ed of the chief nobility. It then con&s;i&s;ted of nine articles, and &s;erved for the foundation of the laws publi&s;hed in the next century by Alfred. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Sigebert, &s;hewed him&s;elf a tyrant; and he was dethroned by his &s;ubjects, who were a free people; while the Saxon heptarchy was &s;oon after di&s;&s;olved, and the Engli&s;h monarchy founded by Egbert.</P>
<P>The great Egbert was of the blood royal of the line of Cerdic; but the crown was granted to him by the election of the people, who, in the language of the be&s;t hi&s;torian, William of Malme&s;bury, commanded him to reign in the year 800. He found the Saxon &s;trength was degenerated, and their common liberty endanger|ed by the potency of Charlemagne, who had cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be crowned Emperor of the We&s;t. But in 829, Egbert became the &s;ole monarch of all the hep|tarchy, and was crowned King of Britain by the con|&s;ent
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin, vol. I. p. 175.</NOTE>
<PB N="332" REF="477">of both clergy and laity, a&s;&s;embled in a general council at Winche&s;ter; after which all the Saxon king|doms were ordered to pa&s;s under the common name of England; and it is ob&s;ervable, that Egbert was not only the father of the Engli&s;h monarchy, but al&s;o the augu&s;t ance&s;tor in the female line of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Hanover.</P>
<P>About this time the Danes and Normans became terrible to England and France; nor were their depre|dations abated, till they made &s;ettlements in both countries: indeed they were another &s;warm of the old northern hive, and were only a remoter branch of the Saxons. The Danes were formidable at &s;ea, and the naval glory of the Saxons had &s;ub&s;ided; but Alfred revived it in 882, and Edgar compleated it in 959; which for many years pre&s;erved the liberty of England. Alfred was ju&s;tly called the father of the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution; but he could not prevent the Danes from &s;et|tling in his dominions, while he was forming the ori|gin of tho&s;e laws which have pre&s;erved the glory of England, and the liberties of Engli&s;hmen; be&s;ides, he founded, or at lea&s;t greatly augmented, the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and the &s;ciences flouri&s;hed under his pro|tection.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alfred bravely oppo&s;ed the incur|&s;ions of the Danes till the reign of Ethelred II. who gave his enemies an opportunity of rendering them|&s;elves more formidable than ever; and notwith&s;tand|ing the bravery of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Edmund Iron&s;ide, the Danes &s;ucceeded in their attempts; for on his death Canute became the fir&s;t. Dani&s;h King of England in 1016.</P>
<P>The Dani&s;h conqueror governed England like a Saxon monarch: the Danes, in a cour&s;e of two hundred years, had intermarried with the Engli&s;h families, and were &s;o much incorporated as to become one people. The Saxon laws were confirmed, and the Danes &s;ub|mitted to them. But the two &s;ucceeding monarchs be|haved
<PB N="333" REF="478">like tyrants, which renewed the Engli&s;h &s;pirit, and recovered the liberty of England; for the Saxon line was re&s;tored in 1041, in the per&s;on of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, who reduced the We&s;t Saxon, Mercian and Dani&s;h laws into one body, which are &s;till in force as the common law of the land.</P>
<P>Harold II. was an u&s;urper, but was deprived both of his crown and life by an invader. This was Wil|liam the Conqueror, who defeated Harold in 1066, and a&s;cended the throne which he claimed by the te&s;ta|ment of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, without any mention of conque&s;t, as he was con&s;cious that the Engli&s;h were tenacious of their liberty.</P>
<P>The Normans very probably had the &s;ame original with the Danes, and e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves under Rollo, in 876, in that part of France to which he gave the name of Normandy. A potent kingdom was now en&s;laved by a &s;mall dukedom; for, after the battle of Ha&s;tings, the Engli&s;h thought no more of &s;triving for their liberties, becau&s;e the Conqueror ac|cepted the crown on the pretence of election, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;erting his right by conque&s;t; he &s;wore to ob|&s;erve the ancient laws of the kingdom, promi&s;ed to protect the liberties of the people; but he &s;oon at|tempted to make England a land of &s;lavery, while the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions became the property of Normans, and a new race of people &s;pread them&s;elves over the nations. William introduced the feodal law, and &s;ome Norman cu&s;toms, which he engrafted on tho&s;e of the Saxons. The introduction of military tenures was a violent blow upon Engli&s;h liberty, and all public acts were made in the Norman tongue; &s;o that Eng|land &s;eemed as if &s;he was going to be deprived of every thing precious and valuable. But the union of the Norman and Saxon lines under Henry I. promi&s;ed better days to England; for this prince, in 1100, con|firmed his coronation-oath by his charter, which con|fined the royal authority within its ancient bounds, and
<PB N="334" REF="479">guarded the &s;ubjects from arbitrary power; be&s;ides, he married the Prince&s;s Matilda, the niece of Edgar Athe|ling, who was the immediate heir of the line of Cerdic, whereby the Saxons and Normans con&s;idered them|&s;elves only as one united body of Engli&s;hmen.</P>
<P>The conque&s;t is indeed a great epocha in the civil hi&s;tory of our country, but none at all in the hi&s;tory of literature, the &s;ame darkne&s;s continued in the nation, and &s;eems for a time to have rather increa&s;ed. Wil|liam the Conqueror was wholly employed in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing his authority in his newly acquired dominions, with which view he endeavoured to aboli&s;h the Engli&s;h laws, and changed the methods of proceeding in the courts of judicature. He was al&s;o extremely &s;olicitous to bring in the general u&s;e of the Norman, upon the ruins of the Saxon tongue; this however he could not effect; the con&s;equences of which attempt was, that both languages degenerated from their orginal &s;tate, and became in &s;ome mea&s;ure mixed with each other.</P>
<P>The Saxon <HI>Wettenagemot</HI> was turned into the Nor|man parliament, and arbitrary power was bound by legal right. Stephen was elected King, on condition of re&s;toring the kingdom to its liberties, aboli&s;hing the fore&s;t laws, and receiving tho&s;e of Edward the Con|fe&s;&s;or; but the ambition of the clergy, and the power of the barons, were too great for the prerogative of the King, and England became a prey to the fury of civil wars. When King John obtained the crown, he was informed by Hubert, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, "That he a&s;cended the throne by election, and not by here|ditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; to the end that he might always re|member, that tho&s;e who gave him the crown, had likewi&s;e the power to take it away." All the Kings from William the Conqueror &s;wore to the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the laws, though that oath was ob|&s;erved by none. John wanted to render him&s;elf ab|&s;olute; and his people wanted as much to pre&s;erve their liberty: he levied &s;everal oppre&s;&s;ive taxes; the
<PB N="315" REF="480">Pope ab&s;olved his &s;ubjects from their oath of allegiance, and the King paid a &s;hameful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the papal nuncio; the barons entered into a confederacy to pre|&s;erve the con&s;titution, and formally demanded the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of the laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, with the removal of the charter of Henry I. The King &s;wore he would never grant his &s;ubjects &s;uch li|berties, as would make him&s;elf a &s;lave; but the barons took to their arms, and compelled the monarch to meet them in Runemead, or the mead of Council, be|tween Staines and Wind&s;or; where, on the fifth of June 1215, they obtained the &s;acred charter of their liberties called Magna Charta, as al&s;o the charter of the liberties of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The charters are the foundation of the Engli&s;h liber|ties, and the bulwark of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. Some princes have imprudently attempted to break this &s;acred barrier; but they found the &s;pirit of the people above &s;uch an innovation, and they &s;uffered for their temerity. However, the bill of rights, made in con&s;equence of the revolution, is declaratory of tho&s;e liberties to which Engli&s;hmen are entitled, and which God grant may never be violated.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;tate of religion ju&s;t before the conque&s;t; although at this time many corruptions had crept into the church, and divine wor&s;hip began to be clogged with &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies; yet it appears that the Briti&s;h church, in &s;ome material points, had not conformed to the errors of the Romi&s;h &s;ee.</P>
<P>For, fir&s;t, both clergy and laity were required to exerci&s;e them&s;elves in reading the &s;acred &s;criptures, &s;inging p&s;alms, &amp;c. The bi&s;hops and teachers were recommended to the &s;tudy of the Old Te&s;tament, ac|cording to the original Hebrew, and the New accord|ing to the oriental Greek. And though we find prayers for the dead, yet they were not in the nature of pro|pitiation for their &s;ins, or to procure relaxation from their torments, but were only an honourable comme|moration

Purgatory was not then in the &s;en&s;e in which it is at pre&s;ent received; and although they pretended vi&s;ions and revelations on which to found purgatory, it was held to be de&s;titute of the authority of &s;cripture
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Church Hi&s;tory, who cites Bede Eccle&s;. Hi&s;t. lib. 3. cap. 5. Hi&s;tory of the Church of Great Britain, p. 37.</NOTE>." And Bede likewi&s;e relates, that the communion was received under both kinds. Cuthbert him&s;elf, a little before his decea&s;e, received the communion of the Lord's body and blood; and though the word ma&s;s was frequent in this age, yet it was not known to be offered as a propitiatory &s;acrifice for the quick and the dead.</P>
<P>There were neverthele&s;s &s;uch a prevalence of many of the Popi&s;h principles and ceremonies, that the more &s;erious and di&s;cerning among the Engli&s;h began to be greatly alarmed, e&s;pecially as it was become a cu&s;tom at this time in the Roman Catholic countries to impo&s;e the belief of the Catholic faith, and a conformity to their ceremonies, under the &s;anction of penal laws or eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>Some who were zealous for a reformation in France about this time, expo&s;ed them&s;elves to great difficulty and hazard. Among the&s;e Berengarius, who was arch|deacon of Angers in 1059, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by inveighing again&s;t the real pre&s;ence, who preached and propagated what he believed to be the truth, in oppo|&s;ition to the wor&s;hip of &s;aints and images, and other favourite doctrines of the church of Rome, was ba|ni&s;hed. That province, and many of his adherents, were obliged to de&s;i&s;t from public wor&s;hip, according to what they thought their duty; but as yet any other attempts to a reformation were un&s;ucce&s;sful, through the overgrown power of the Romi&s;h church. See Dupin, Cent. XI.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="484">About this time the antient &s;ect of the Albigen&s;es, or Walden&s;es, were animated with fre&s;h vigour, to &s;tand up for the truth.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Of the State of</HI> KNOWLEDGE <HI>and</HI> RELIGION <HI>in</HI> GREAT BRITAIN, <HI>from the Reign of</HI> WILLIAM <HI>the</HI> CON|QUEROR, 1066, <HI>to the Reign of</HI> RICHARD I.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>WILLIAM, <HI>&s;urnamed the</HI> Conqueror, A. D. 1066.</HEAD>
<P>IF we impartially con&s;ider the Duke of Normandy's attempt upon England, we &s;hall find it difficult to determine, whether the ground of his preten&s;ions, the boldne&s;s of his undertaking, or the &s;ucce&s;s attending it, is mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing: the con&s;equence was a dreadful anarchy of perplexity and con&s;ternation, from different motives of intere&s;t, terror, and de&s;pair, which this de|&s;truction occa&s;ioned in London. The Conqueror con|&s;idered that the lo&s;s of a battle might a&s;toni&s;h, but not terrify the Engli&s;h; that they might have con&s;iderable re|&s;ources of men and arms, before he could be much rein|forced from Normandy. However, he concluded to be|gin his march for London, in three divi&s;ions; ordering his men, if attacked, to de&s;troy the country with fire and &s;word. As he approached the capital in this manner, the terrors of the people waxed &s;tronger and &s;tronger, and the clergy u&s;ed all their indu&s;try and in&s;inuation to di&s;&s;uade them from making re&s;i&s;tance. But, in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions, Morcar and Edwin, the two brothers of Harold, took an opportunity to &s;ally out with their party from London, thinking to find him unprepared: but they were &s;o warmly re|ceived, that they retired with great precipitation; and
<PB N="343" REF="490">even this attempt was attended with no &s;mall di&s;ad|vantage, for it occa&s;ioned his &s;etting fire to &s;ome parts of the &s;uburbs of London; &s;o that at this time the nobles and prelates a&s;&s;embled at London, would no lon|ger delay to &s;eize the only opportunity they might have, to plead the merit of a voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. They ac|cordingly went forth, attended by the magi&s;trates of London, and meeting the Duke at the head of his troops, made a &s;olemn tender of the crown: he received them with great courte&s;y, and, after having taken time to deliberate upon the propo&s;al, accepted the offer they had made, and a&s;&s;ured them they would have no cau&s;e to repent of their choice
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smollet, vol. I. p. 391.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Norman having thus acknowledged the power of election in the people of England, in deigning to receive the crown as a pre&s;ent, was immediately proclaimed King, and appointed the day for his coro|nation at London; and pur&s;uant to his own de&s;ire the ceremony was performed by Aldred archbi&s;hop of York; who upon that occa&s;ion addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Engli&s;h, a&s;&s;embled in great numbers, a&s;ked if they cho&s;e William Duke of Normandy for their King? and was an&s;wered in the affirmative, with loud acclamations. The bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance having put the &s;ame que&s;tion to the Normans, and received the like reply, Aldred &s;et the crown on his head; and then the Norman took the accu&s;tomed oath, importing that he would protect the church and its mini&s;ters, govern his people with equity, enact ju&s;t laws, and cau&s;e them to be punctually ob&s;erved
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Malme&s;bury.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act of &s;overeignty he exerci&s;ed after his coronation, was the &s;eizure of Harold's trea&s;ure, which he found ama&s;&s;ed at Winche&s;ter, part of which he di&s;tributed among the principal officers of his army, part was given to churches and mona&s;teries; and a large &s;hare &s;ent to the Pope, as a mark of his grati|tude
<PB N="344" REF="491">for the countenance of that pontiff, to whom he in great mea&s;ure owed the &s;ucce&s;s of his late enterprize.</P>
<P>He granted a new charter to the city of London, confirming the privileges which the citizens enjoyed in the reign of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. He pre&s;erved the Saxon laws and con&s;titution, and put the laws in force again&s;t robbers, who then infe&s;ted the country; and in order to add to the &s;afety of his kingdom, he built two ca&s;tles, one at Che&s;ter, and the other at Stafford, which he &s;trengthened with garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act of his arbitrary power was manife&s;ted, in renewing the odious tax of <HI>danegelt,</HI> a quit-rent out of all the lands of England, ward&s;hips, reliefs, fines, &amp;c.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was one &s;hilling on every hide of land, that is, an hun|dred acres; but every manurer of land paid if he had but a tenth part. Rapin, vol. I. b. v. p. 141.</NOTE>. This occa&s;ioned a general di&s;content through the kingdom, and made &s;ome in&s;urrections, which William very &s;everely puni&s;hed. After all the &s;ources of rebellion were qua&s;hed, William endeavoured to in|troduce the laws, cu&s;toms, and language of the Nor|mans; loading his countrymen with benefits, and op|pre&s;&s;ing the nobles and barons of this realm. Nor was his oppre&s;&s;ions confined to the nobility, but extended al&s;o to the clergy, who&s;e charters he violated without &s;cruple; ordained that the church-lands &s;hould be &s;ub|ject to military &s;ervice, and furni&s;h a certain number of hor&s;emen: be&s;ides, he lodged great part of his army in mona&s;teries. Where he could get any information of any riches hid or depo&s;ited in them, he ordered them to be &s;earched, and &s;eized upon every thing that was valuable. He likewi&s;e depo&s;ed Stigand, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and &s;everal other prelates, and promoted to their dignity &s;trangers from different climes, and &s;ome of his Norman chaplains, and &s;eized on many of the abbey-lands. By the&s;e means he &s;trengthened his intere&s;t, increa&s;ed his revenues, and made him&s;elf the terror of the country, where they were too weak to re|&s;i&s;t.
<PB N="345" REF="492">Many of the Engli&s;h nobility fled to Scotland. This &s;o exa&s;perated William, that he picked a quarrel with Malcolm King of Scotland, A. D. 1072, who was too well prepared to be immediately intimidated; both parties prepared for war, and both armies ready for action, but not eager to begin the attack. William found them well entrenched, and knew Mal|colm had been trained to arms, &s;o that both parties inclined to an accommodation; and on Malcolm's &s;ending an emba&s;&s;y to William, a peace was made on the following terms: "That the boundaries of the two nations &s;hould be &s;ettled; that he &s;hould &s;wear fealty to him, or do him homage; and that William &s;hould re&s;tore the Engli&s;h exiles to their e&s;tates.</P>
<P>After William had made things a little ea&s;y at home, he retired to Normandy, when a con&s;iderable revolu|tion happened in the church. At the death of Allexander there was no &s;mall di&s;&s;ention in the conclave, which flamed &s;o high, that two Popes were elected, viz. Hildebrand and Guibert, who were each of them ac|knowledged by different powers. However, the former, named Gregory VII. was recognized by the Kings of France and England; but Hildebrand was no &s;ooner &s;ettled in the chair, than he di&s;covered him|&s;elf to be a per&s;on of inordinate ambition and extraor|dinary in&s;olence: determined to make William pay for the countenance and favour he had &s;hewn him while he was cardinal, &s;oon after his return to England, he &s;ent one of his nuncios to him with letters, wherein he in&s;i&s;ted on his doing homage to him for the king|dom of England, as a fief of the Roman &s;ee, and de|manded the arrears of Rome Scot, which had not been paid for &s;ome years.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer which William made to this in&s;olent demand, was worthy of the King of England. He re|fu&s;ed to do fealty to the Pope, and &s;trengthened his refu&s;al, by appealing to the conduct of his ance&s;tors,
<PB N="346" REF="493">who had never left him a precedent. The following is a tran&s;lation of the original
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Selden, p. 1631.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"To the mo&s;t excellent Gregory, pa&s;tor of the holy church, William, by the grace of God, King of England, and Duke of Normandy, &s;endeth, greeting. Hubert, your nuncio, coming unto me in your be|half, advi&s;ed me to do fealty to you and your &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, and to take more care in making good the pay|ments of money, which my predece&s;&s;ors u&s;ed to remit to the church of Rome. One of the&s;e I have con&s;ent|ed to, but have refu&s;ed the other. As for fealty, it is what I never have done, nor will do; becau&s;e I neither obliged my&s;elf to perform it by any promi&s;e made by my&s;elf, nor do I find my predece&s;&s;ors ever performed it to yours. As for the money, it was col|lected in a very bad manner, for almo&s;t three years, during my ab&s;ence in France. But now I am, by God's mercy, returned to my kingdom, I have &s;ent by the nuncio above-mentioned, what is already collected: as for the remainder, it &s;hall be &s;ent, when convenient, by the legate of Lanfranc, our tru&s;ty archbi&s;hop. We beg your prayers for our&s;elves, and the welfare of our kingdom, having born a great regard for your prede|ce&s;&s;ors, and being de&s;irous of approving our affections and obedience to you above all others."</P>
<P>And although this politic Prince was thus compli|mentarily courteous to the Pope, yet he retained the ancient cu&s;tom of inve&s;ting bi&s;hops and abbots, by de|livering them a ring, and a &s;taff, whereby, without more ado, they were put into plenary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the power and the profits of their benefice; for he always declared he would keep the pa&s;toral &s;taves in his own hands. Nor would the King &s;uffer any in his domini|ons to acknowledge the bi&s;hop of Rome for apo&s;tolical without his command, or to receive the Pope's letters, except they were fir&s;t &s;hewn unto him; nor did the King permit the bi&s;hops to pa&s;s &s;entence of excommuni|cation
<PB N="347" REF="494">again&s;t any of his barons or officers, although it was for the commi&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t heinous crimes, except leave was fir&s;t had and obtained from the King. However, the King did grant to the bi&s;hops the juri&s;|diction in religious matters, and the grant of tithes, as well &s;mall as great.</P>
<P>The King likewi&s;e made an act for the uniformity of the liturgy, which was to be regulated by that then in u&s;e at Sali&s;bury, compo&s;ed by O&s;mond bi&s;hop of that &s;ee.</P>
<P>About this time the King had conte&s;ts with the Welch and the Scotch; he levied a numerous army, and marched with re&s;olution to cha&s;ti&s;e and reduce them to obedience. The peace being &s;ettled, he turn|ed his mind to putting his finances in a condition to &s;upply all his nece&s;&s;ities; and in this no prince, per|haps, had ever greater penetration or invention than he di&s;covered in the various means made u&s;e of for this end, e&s;pecially as he &s;tuck at nothing he judged &s;ub|&s;ervient to this point, on which his &s;afety &s;o much de|pended. The Saxons were already fleeced to gratify his avarice, the Normans were grown opulent by their &s;poils; and as they had for a con&s;iderable time enjoyed the benefit of his government, he thought it but ju&s;t they &s;hould pay their &s;hare towards its &s;upport; and that he might know what impo&s;itions they could bear, he ordered an e&s;timate to be taken of all the lands in his kingdom. Commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed, who had a right to make inque&s;t, upon oath, upon or near the premi&s;&s;es, of the extent and value of the arable, meadow, and pa&s;ture land, every individual had. This &s;urvey was no le&s;s than &s;ix years in making, and was con|tained in two books. This regi&s;ter was &s;ometimes called the roll of Winche&s;ter, becau&s;e it was depo&s;ited there. It was al&s;o named Domboc, which name was not given it becau&s;e it decides any dubious matters, but becau&s;e it is illegal to depart or appeal from its deci&s;ions. It is now called DOMESDAY-BOOK.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="495">This &s;cheme &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that per&s;ons of all ranks were included, and the value of their e&s;tates pretty well known, &s;o as to receive a proportionable taxation. The next year, which was 1084, was re|markable for nothing &s;o much as the oppre&s;&s;ive tax of &s;ix &s;hillings upon every hide of land throughout his kingdom. Whether avarice or policy might have given ri&s;e for this oppre&s;&s;ion, is very uncertain. He applied part of it for building the Tower of London. The di&s;|affection and jealou&s;ies, it occa&s;ioned, are much better conceived than de&s;cribed. It was very natural for him to fear the re&s;entment of his &s;ubjects, if any opportu|nity pre&s;ented. An inva&s;ion of the Danes indeed &s;oon after happened; but the Engli&s;h did not care to join them, and it was &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: however, it plea&s;ed God at length to put a &s;top to his tyrannical reign; for he went to Normandy, A. D. 1087, and died, oc|ca&s;ioned by a fall from his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>From the tran&s;actions of William's reign, he ap|pears to have been a prince of great courage, capacity, and ambition, politic, cruel, vindictive and rapacious, &s;tern and haughty in his deportment, re&s;erved and jealous in his di&s;po&s;ition; but though &s;udden and im|petuous in his enterpri&s;es, he was cool and indefati|gable in time of danger and difficulty. A late ingeni|ous author calls him a <HI>glorious tyrant;</HI> an epithet I &s;hall leave my readers to judge of its propriety.</P>

<HEAD>WILLIAM II. <HI>&s;urnamed</HI> Rufus, A. D. 1087.</HEAD>
<P>The Conqueror was &s;ucceeded by William, his &s;econd &s;on, called Rufus, from his ruddy complexion, who owed his elevation to that dignity, to Langfranc, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury. Some oppo&s;ition was indeed agitated, and the nation &s;eemed to be in &s;ome commo|tion; but Langfranc wi&s;ely advi&s;ed him to conciliate the affections of the Engli&s;h: and he accordingly amu&s;ed them with magnificent promi&s;es to ea&s;e them
<PB N="349" REF="496">of their burthen&s;ome tolls and taxes, and allow them the free liberty of hunting. Cajoled by the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, which were void of all &s;incerity, the Engli&s;h adhered to his intere&s;t; and the Londoners rai&s;ed an army of 30,000 men for his &s;ervice. But it was not long after, when William began to &s;how &s;o much of his father's di&s;po&s;ition, as even to procure a new &s;urvey of many of the lands in England, and laid heavier taxes upon them. By this and other methods, which di&s;covered his rapacious di&s;po&s;ition, great conte&s;ts en&s;ued both in Scotland and Wales. A treaty was however brought about, and peace concluded, with Malcolm of Scot|land: but William by his in&s;olence and perfidy &s;oon broke the treaty; and when Malcolm &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors, demanding the performance of the articles in the late treaty, he de&s;ired the Scotti&s;h King to come in per|&s;on, to his court at Glouce&s;ter, where he &s;hould have ju&s;tice done him. Accordingly he came, where he was treated very imperiou&s;ly, and was told he mu&s;t &s;ubmit the affair to the deci&s;ion of the Engli&s;h peers. Malcolm rejecting this, returned to his own country; and, glowing with indignation, forthwith a&s;&s;embled an army, and invaded Northumberland, which he ravaged as far as Alnwick; when he had &s;o far redu|ced the gari&s;on, that the governor demanded a capitu|lation, on pretence of pre&s;enting him the keys on the point of his &s;pear, thru&s;t his weapon into his eye, and killed him on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>But this is contradicted by Aderic. Vital. Eccle&s;. Hi&s;t. l. 8. p. 701. who &s;ays that Malcolm was &s;ur|prized under the &s;ecurity of a treaty, and unexpectedly attacked by Molbray

<P>About the year A.

To pay this money, King Rufus laid a grievous tax over all the realm; extorting it with &s;uch &s;everity, that the monks were obliged to &s;ell their church-plate, and even their chalices; and when the clergy de&s;ired to be ea&s;ed of their burdens, he bid them &s;earch for their coffins of gold and &s;ilver, and dead mens bones.</P>
<P>At this time there was a contention at Rome be|tween two Popes, Urban and Clement III. Rufus took part with Clement; but An&s;elm acknowledged Urban, and de&s;ired of the King leave to fetch his pall off Urban: all the re&s;t of the bi&s;hops were again&s;t him; mean while the King had &s;ent two me&s;&s;engers to the Pope, for the pall; who returned with the Pope's legate, with the pall, to be given to An&s;elm: this legate &s;o far per&s;uaded the King, that he acknowledged Urban for Pope. But upon his delivering An&s;elm the archbi&s;hop's pall, thereby making void the inve&s;|titure he received from King William, and obli|ging him afterward to acknowledge his right of in|ve&s;titure, it gave great di&s;plea&s;ure to the King; where|upon he expelled An&s;elm his kingdom, confi&s;cated the lands of the archbi&s;hopric, and declared that his bi&s;hops did and &s;hould hold their &s;ees of him, inde|pendent of the Pope. An&s;elm compromi&s;ed this affair
<PB N="351" REF="498">by the intervention of friends: upon which he returned to England; but was &s;o zealous for maintaining and propagating the opinion of the Pope's &s;ole right of inve&s;titure, that he was again obliged to fly from the kingdom.</P>
<P>William the Conqueror having rendered the new Fore&s;t in Hants, by his deva&s;tation of towns and churches, a wilderne&s;s for men, and a paradi&s;e for deer; King Rufus went there on a party of plea|&s;ure, when the King was &s;lain by the glance of an ar|row, &s;hot by Sir Walter Tirrell.</P>
<P>Thus fell William, after the reign of thirteen years, during which he oppre&s;&s;ed his people in every form of tyranny and in&s;ult. He was equally void of learn|ing, principles and humanity; haughty, pa&s;&s;ionate, profligate and ungrateful; a &s;coffer at religion, a &s;courge to the clergy, vain-glorious, rapacious and di&s;&s;olute, and an inveterate enemy to the Engli&s;h, though he owed his crown to their valour and fidelity; when the Normans attempted to deprive him of the crown, &s;carce po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one &s;ingle virtue, to compen&s;ate for his vices; and, in the words of the celebrated Mr. Pope, DAMNED TO EVERLASTING FAME.</P>

<HEAD>HENRY I. <HI>&s;urnamed</HI> BEAUCLERK, A. D. 1100.</HEAD>
<P>Henry, the younge&s;t &s;on of the Conqueror (&s;ur|named Beauclerk, which &s;ignifies a good &s;cholar) &s;uc|ceeded to the crown, though, had his brother been in England at the time of Rufus's death, the Engli&s;h &s;eemed more bia&s;&s;ed in his favour, and he would pro|bably have acceded to the crown. However, circum|&s;tances favoured Henry's advancement to the throne, though not without &s;ome tumultuous oppo&s;ition at the election, and he was immediately proclaimed King. And as the people had too much rea&s;on during the two la&s;t reigns, to think that a King is very apt to di&s;re|gard his coronation-oath, Henry, for the farther &s;a|tisfaction
<PB N="352" REF="499">of his &s;ubjects, granted the &s;ame day a char|ter, confirming their privileges, and redre&s;&s;ing &s;ome greivances under which they laboured. By this deed, which was authenticated in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, and tran&s;cribed into a great number of copies, di&s;|per&s;ed all over the kingdom, he e&s;tabli&s;hed the churches in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their immunities, and ex|empted them from all the hard&s;hips they had &s;u&s;tained from the tyranny of Rufus, e&s;pecially that of being kept vacant for the King's u&s;e, and afterwards put up to public &s;ale, without any regard to merit or capacity. He aboli&s;hed the exce&s;&s;ive fines which u&s;ed to be exac|ted from the heirs of noblemen for the livery of their lands; permitted the natives in general to di&s;po&s;e of their children in marriage, according to their own plea|&s;ure, without paying for a licence from the crown. He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the duty of moneyage, paid once in three years, in con&s;ideration of the King's pre&s;erving the coins unaltered. He remitted all fines, mulcts, and debts in the exchequer, ari&s;ing from vexatious pro&s;e|cutions; allowed the barons to bequeathe their per|&s;onal e&s;tates; exempted the lands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the mi|litary tenants of the crown from gelds, talliages and be|nevolences; re&s;tored the laws of Edward III. relative to murders, thefts, &amp;c. and forgave all rapine and depredation committed to that time, on condition the offenders would make immediate re&s;titution.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the &s;ame laudable &s;cheme of refor|mation and redre&s;s, he expelled from court all the mi|ni&s;ters and in&s;truments of his brother's debauchery and arbitrary power, and publi&s;hed a &s;evere edict again&s;t delinquents and adulterers; he aboli&s;hed the odious curfew, requiring every man at the ring of a bell at eight o'clock to put out his fire.</P>
<P>As Henry had been greatly obliged to the citizens of London in his acqui&s;ition of the crown, he gratified them with another charter of very ample privileges; and, in order to crown the &s;atisfaction of the people, he re|called
<PB N="353" REF="500">An&s;elm, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who was become exceeding popular in England through the in|fluence of the monks. The prelate accepted the in|vitation with tran&s;port, and &s;oon after landed at Dover; but the King was greatly di&s;appointed when he found that An&s;elm refu&s;ed to do him homage, adhering to the canons of the council of Bari, which forbad eccle|&s;ia&s;tics to receive inve&s;titures from the laity, or to pay them homage on any account; and the conditions of their living together in a good under&s;tanding were, that the king &s;hould relinqui&s;h the prerogative of in|ve&s;ting bi&s;hops and abbots, and pay an implicit obedi|ence to the Pope. Henry, though &s;hocked at the in|&s;olent propo&s;als of this arrogant prie&s;t, who wanted to curtail his authority, was forced to temporize. For about this time his brother Robert a&s;&s;erts his claim to the Engli&s;h crown, and if An&s;elm's intere&s;t were to have been thrown in that &s;cale, it might preponderate on that &s;ide; and even, notwith&s;tanding, the king's moderation, when Robert his brother made a de&s;cent at Port&s;mouth, he found the people's mind fluctuating, and the King was obliged to depend, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on the eloquence and intere&s;t of An&s;elm, to pre&s;erve peace and loyalty to his maje&s;ty; &s;o that at length af|fairs were compromi&s;ed. Henry now proceeded with rigour again&s;t many of the nobles who had promoted the inva&s;ion by his brother: &s;ome were bani&s;hed, their e&s;tates &s;eized, &amp;c. while he rewarded others for their zealous attachment to his royal per&s;on.</P>
<P>But all the nobles in the land were more ea&s;ily managed than the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who was a true monk and bigot to the church of Rome. For his de&s;ign was to accompli&s;h two projects: the fir&s;t was to e&s;tabli&s;h celibacy among eccle&s;ia&s;tics; (An&s;elm called a council at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where fir&s;t he excom|municated all married prie&s;ts, though half the clergy at that time were married;) and the &s;econd, to hinder bi&s;hops and abbots from receiving the inve&s;titure of
<PB N="354" REF="501">their benefices from the King. The Pope had given his orders for in&s;i&s;ting upon the execution of the canons again&s;t lay inve&s;titure; neverthele&s;s, the King refu&s;ed to part with his prerogative, and An&s;elm refu&s;ed to con|&s;ecrate the bi&s;hops whom Henry had appointed. This produced a quarrel, which at length An&s;elm re&s;olved to go and lay before Pope Pa&s;cal II. A. D. 1103; and he was accompanied by &s;ome bi&s;hops, who had quitted their benefices, rather than acknowlege the King's &s;u|premacy; and the King &s;ent two amba&s;&s;adors at the &s;ame time to defend his cau&s;e. But notwith&s;tanding their remon&s;trance the Pope remained inflexible, and would not make any conce&s;&s;ions, though he wrote a letter to the King in mild terms, telling him, "He &s;hould be glad to oblige him in any thing that was con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice; that he had no de&s;ign of in|croaching upon his prerogative; but the granting the right of inve&s;titure to a layman was not in his power, as it was an e&s;&s;ential property of church-government."</P>
<P>The King was not well plea&s;ed with the Pope's an|&s;wer, and ordered his amba&s;&s;adors to acquaint An&s;elm, that he did not de&s;ire to &s;ee him in England, unle&s;s he was re&s;olved to conform to the example of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Henry was abroad in Normandy, he received an expo&s;tulatory letter from the Pope, by the hand of An&s;elm, and the King allowed him to return to Eng|land.</P>
<P>When An&s;elm arrived here, he was received very joyfully; and repairing to Canterbury with the pall in a &s;ilver box, the archbi&s;hop went bare-footed to meet him, attended by all the monks of St. Augu&s;tine and Chri&s;t-church.</P>
<P>A legate was likewi&s;e &s;ent by, Pope Henorius II. to go to England and Scotland in the quality of legate <HI>&agrave; latere,</HI> and on his arrival was received by the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury with all the honours due to his character. The legate being commi&s;&s;ioned to enquire
<PB N="355" REF="502">into the di&s;&s;entions between the archbi&s;hop of York and the Scotch prelates, who refu&s;ed to acknowledge his primacy, went to Roxburgh, where he held a confe|rence with David, King of Scotland, on that &s;ubject. On his return, he pre&s;ided at a general convocation of the prelates and clergy, where, to &s;hew his authority, he was &s;eated on an eminence above the &s;eats of the archbi&s;hops and temporal lords, who attended the council, which was very di&s;agreeable to many of the Engli&s;h, and the council ended with no important ad|vantages.</P>
<P>We might enlarge in the hi&s;tory of the reign of Henry I. by a variety of tran&s;actions of a civil nature; but as that is not my province, &s;hall conclude with only ob&s;erving, that he died of a fever, A. D. 1135, and &s;hall &s;um up his character in a few words. He was too fond of foreigners, too vindictive to his enemies, too &s;en&s;ible to be an enthu&s;ia&s;t, too cautious to be &s;urpri&s;ed, too valiant to be conquered, too good to de&s;erve the calumnies ca&s;t on him by the monks, and too bad to be generally applauded.</P>

<HEAD>STEPHEN, A. D. 1135.</HEAD>
<P>Stephen a&s;cending the throne, after being elected, rather by a cabal of prelates and noblemen, than by a general con&s;ent of the nation, re&s;olved to &s;ecure the favour of the nation by &s;ome extraordinary conce&s;&s;ions; and therefore over and above his promi&s;e of ruling with equity and moderation, he &s;olemnly &s;wore that he would not retain vacant &s;ees and benefices in his hands, but fill them immediately with per&s;ons cano|nically elected; that he would not di&s;turb the clergy or laity in the enjoyment of their woods; that he would not &s;ue any per&s;on for hunting in the royal fo|re&s;t; that he would never exact the tax of danegelt. The Engli&s;h were &s;o credulous as to believe he would pay a greater regard to it, than was evident from his future conduct. However, partly through his own
<PB N="356" REF="503">treachery and mi&s;conduct, his whole reign was a &s;cene of war and conte&s;t, both abroad and at home. We meet with very few tran&s;actions relative to learning or religion. There were however many religious founda|tions built and endowed in the trouble&s;ome reign of King Stephen; as the mona&s;tery of St. Mary de Pratis, founded by Robert, Earl of Leice&s;ter; the ho&s;pital of St. Catherine, near London, founded by Maud, wife of King Stephen; and St. Stephen's chapel at We&s;t|min&s;ter, founded by him&s;elf; as al&s;o the Ci&s;tertian mo|na&s;try at Fever&s;ham, with an ho&s;pital near the We&s;t-gate at York, &amp;c.</P>
<P>He died after a &s;hort illne&s;s in 1154. His character is that of humane and generous: he &s;eems to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many great qualities; and, had he lived in happier times, he might probably have been reckoned one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious monarchs that ever filled the Engli&s;h throne.</P>

<HEAD>HENRY II. A. D. 1154.</HEAD>
<P>Henry came to the crown with an indi&s;putable title. He was a prince, wi&s;e, valiant, and generally fortunate. Soon after his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, he cho&s;e a privy-council of clergy and temporality, and refined the common laws. He parcelled England into &s;ix di|vi&s;ions, and appointed three judges to every circuit. He era&s;ed many of the ca&s;tles to the ground, as he found they were held by per&s;ons in a kind of indepen|dence of the crown, and derogatory to the authority of it. The&s;e regulations &s;eem fir&s;t and principally to en|gro&s;s his attention, but he afterwards found others to demand his concern. The gro&s;s impo&s;itions of the Pope highly threatened the diminution of his royal prerogatives; &s;o that he di&s;claimed the Pope's autho|rity, refufed to pay Peter-pence, and interdicted all appeals to Rome. But he only, or chiefly, regarded his temporal prerogatives; for had not they been in|vaded
<PB N="357" REF="504">by the prelates, under the direction of the Pope, they might have continued their influence in the church in all &s;piritual affairs. However, the King was not &s;ufficiently upon his guard in the choice of his fa|vourites.</P>
<P>Thomas Becket, doctor of canon law, was, by the King, made chancellor of England; and four years after he was, by the King, made archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury; and this, in proce&s;s of time, proved highly prejudicial to his maje&s;ty's authority. One of the fir&s;t matters of di&s;pute was, that the King having com|manded that ju&s;tice &s;hould be impartially executed up|on all men in his court, Becket in&s;i&s;ted on the clergy being exempt from the juri&s;diction of the civil magi&s;|trate, and judged in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court. This incen&s;ed the King again&s;t him. To adju&s;t matters of importance, the King called a parliament at Clarenden, to confirm the antient laws and cu&s;toms; to which Becket and the re&s;t of the bi&s;hops con&s;ented, and &s;ub&s;cribed to them; but Becket afterwards recanting, renounced the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year, A. D. 1160, the King required that the law &s;hould be put in execution for &s;ome crimes committed by the clergy, which the archbi&s;hop would not permit; and, without the King's knowledge, de|termined to repair to Rome and lay the affair before the Pope. And this was a matter of debate for &s;ome years.</P>
<P>Matthew Paris recites a variety of letters between this Pope and the King, and between the Pope and the King of France. By the mediation of the latter, Becket had leave to return to England; however the King &s;till retained his temporal authority.</P>
<P>Upon Becket's return to England, he excommuni|cated &s;everal Bi&s;hops. The next year he excommuni|cated lord Sackville, who had been appointed by the King vicar of the church of Canterbury, as he had
<PB N="358" REF="505">derogated, as he called it, from the rights of the church to plea&s;e the King.</P>
<P>The King being then in Normandy, complained greatly, to &s;ome of his dome&s;tics, of the in&s;olent be|haviour of Becket, whom he had rai&s;ed from abject circum&s;tances to &s;uch dignity, and yet by &s;uch unpa|ralleled ingratitude became the continual di&s;turber of his government. Authors vary greatly in their con|jectures, and hi&s;tory affords us nothing certain with re&s;pect to the motives of the per&s;ons who came over to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Becket. Whether they were incited to it by the King, and received any promi&s;es of re|ward for &s;o ra&s;h an action; or whether they were ani|mated by principle only, and a regard to the tranquil|lity of the nation; be this as it will, William de Tra|cy, Reginald Fitzur&s;e, Hugh de Moreville, and Ri|chard Brito, mutually engaged to revenge the King's quarrel. They withdrew from court, and taking &s;hipping at different ports, arrived in England, and met at the ca&s;tle of Saltwode, within &s;ix miles of Can|terbury. The next day they went to Canterbury, and advanced to Becket's apartment, where they warmly ex|po&s;tulated with him about the ra&s;hne&s;s and in&s;olence of his conduct in his &s;tation as chancellor, and more e&s;pe|cially as archbi&s;hop; which making no impre&s;&s;ion upon him, it is &s;aid, they retired to put on their ar|mour, and &s;oon returned to execute the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, which they did with many circum&s;tances of cruelty.</P>

I. p. 375.</NOTE>, "That, upon the news of the arch|bi&s;hop's death, the King and the people were extreme|ly troubled; though it may be ea&s;ily conjectured to proceed from different motives. The King was appre|hen&s;ive that the archbi&s;hop's murder would occa&s;ion reflection and di&s;honour to his highne&s;s; and &s;o, in fact, it did &s;oon. The King of France wrote to his holine&s;s, in which he made no &s;cruple to charge him as culpa|ble in that act; and intimated, that the Pope &s;hould
<PB N="359" REF="506">draw St. Peter's &s;word again&s;t King Henry, and even to think of &s;ome new and exemplary puni&s;hment for a crime in which the univer&s;al church was concerned. This was likewi&s;e followed with another from the Earl of Blois, and another from the archbi&s;hop of Sens, in which he moves for an interdict upon his dominions.</P>
<P>King Henry prote&s;ted his innocence, and &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to Rome, upon his arrival in England, about that time, to compromi&s;e matters; and either from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his fault, or motives of policy, agreed to purcha&s;e his ab&s;olution upon very &s;evere terms. The Pope enjoined him to &s;uffer appeals from England to Rome; to quit his right and claim to in|ve&s;titures; to keep 200 men in arms for the holy war; and to pay forty thou&s;and marks of &s;ilver, and five thou&s;and of gold. Some add, that he &s;ubmitted to &s;trip him&s;elf naked at Canterbury, and to he la&s;hed by divers monks, &s;ome of whom gave him five, others three &s;tripes. This was in A. D. 1170, and the Pope canonized Becket for a &s;aint.</P>
<P>During this reign, a con&s;iderable number of Ger|mans came over to England, to attempt a reformation from &s;ome of the gro&s;s errors of Popery. Authors differ as to their number. The &s;entiments and cha|racter of the&s;e men but agree in this, that they were &s;everely treated, by branding them with hot irons, and by other methods of cruelty; &s;ome were even put to death, which they bore with great fortitude.</P>
<P>The reign of Henry abounds with many acts which redound to his honour, notwith&s;tanding his foibles, which derogate from it. He was educated with high notions of the kingly prerogative, for which he ma|nife&s;ted the mo&s;t inviolable attachment; and he guard|ed the liberties of his &s;ubjects by many excellent laws and regulations. So that, upon the whole, he is rank|ed among the mo&s;t powerful and illu&s;trious of the Engli&s;h monarchs.</P>
