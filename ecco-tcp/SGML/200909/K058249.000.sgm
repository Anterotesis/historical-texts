<SPEAKER>MAC.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I had a mind to make my fortune among the i&s;lands upon the continent; for I had read all the hi&s;tory books of antipathy; &s;o I vowed to be doing &s;omething, as well as paddy Julius Cae&s;ar did; &s;o I agreed with one captain Bowwo to carry me over &s;ea with him; but I told him I would not &s;tand to any damages; for if the &s;hip &s;unk in the middle of the &s;ea, before we got half over, he mu&s;t get another to carry me in, or the Devil a rap I would give him for my pa&s;&s;age.</P>
