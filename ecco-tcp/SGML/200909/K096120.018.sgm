<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Character, Cu&s;toms, Manners, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Savoyards, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> from the nature of their country, are generally &s;o poor, that a traveller &s;eldom meets any upon the public road, who do not recommend them&s;elves to his benevolence; and a farmer, with a yoke of oxen, a couple of hor&s;es, four cows, a few goats and &s;heep, and a &s;mall piece of ground, pa&s;&s;es for a man of &s;ub&s;tance. The bread is generally of rye; with a mixture of wheat and barley, among the better &s;ort. Their drink is milk and wa|ter; their food chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of chee&s;e, butter, wall|nuts, vegetables, and what fle&s;h they can &s;pare, of their own breeding; but the generality are rather under the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;po&s;ing, of part of their &s;tock, to purcha&s;e the other nece&s;&s;aries of life. With this way of living the people are chearful, feed heartily, have a much better complexion than the Piedmonte&s;e,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
live to a great age; and being, at the &s;ame time, &s;o prolific, that the inhabitants, if at home, could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the products of the country, they may well be excu&s;ed in &s;ending their children to &s;eek a livelihood, by &s;hewing monkies, &s;weeping chimnies, blacking &s;hoes, or as they can. The number of &s;uch Savoyards, at Paris, is computed to be above 18,000; of whom the boys are &s;hoe-blacks. In the winter time they live very comfortably, forty or fifty in a room; and, in &s;ummer time, the &s;tones at the thre&s;hold of the hou&s;es &s;erve them for pillows. They are &s;o hone&s;t, that they may be tru&s;ted to change gold. If once they attain to the &s;etting up of a little &s;hop, they are &s;uch ma&s;ters of the thriving talent, that it is often the foundation of a very con&s;iderable fortune. The rich banker and financier, <HI>Croizat,</HI> who&s;e daughter was married to the count <HI>D'Evereux,</HI> of a noble fa|mily in France, was formerly of this fraternity; yet, &s;o prevalent is the love of their country in them, that when ma&s;ters, of any little &s;tock, they generally re|turn home. Every year an old fellow goes up and down the village, and gets together the boys, to con|duct them out of the country, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, like the rat-catcher at Hamel. It is not uncommon that &s;ome of the children, committed to him, are &s;o &s;mall as to be caried away in ba&s;kets. He is al&s;o of further &s;ervice, returning with letters, needles, and &s;uch trifles; and &s;ometimes money, from his countrymen
<PB N="5" REF="6">
at Paris, Lyons, &amp;c. to their parents, relations, and friends. This encourages the people at home to tru&s;t him with fre&s;h colonies; from who&s;e emigration he al&s;o reaps &s;ome little advantage; at lea&s;t, while he is on his circuit in Savoy, he is every where welcome to bed and board.</P>
<P>The nobility, both in Savoy and Piedmont, labour under great oppre&s;&s;ion; indeed the king's ordinances are, in &s;ome re&s;pect, advantageous to them, by having e&s;tabli&s;hed, in all fiefs, the perpetual right of primo|geniture. In allodial e&s;tates, no nobleman can make a feoffment of tru&s;t beyond the fourth degree; but a commoner is dive&s;ted of all &s;uch power. He who takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate, by the right of primoge|niture, is obliged to give the younger children one fourth of the income. Whoever purcha&s;es an e&s;tate, with the title of Marqui&s;ate, Baron, &amp;c. is thereby en|nobled; and &s;uch e&s;tates are to be had for &s;ix or eight thou&s;and livres. Every nobleman mu&s;t prove from whence he derives his arms, el&s;e he is deprived of this right; or mu&s;t be at the charge of purcha&s;ing a new coat of arms. The title is inherent to the e&s;tate. Of all mines, di&s;covered and worked, a certain &s;hare belongs to the king. No per&s;on is to fell trees, not even in his own wood, without leave obtained from the intendant. No money is to be placed at in|tere&s;t, nor lent on mortgages, out of the country.
<PB N="6" REF="7">
No pen&s;ion, or order of knighthood, except that of Malta, is to be accepted from any foreign prince. There is al&s;o a prohibition again&s;t travelling abroad, or entering into any foreign &s;ervice, without a written licence from the king. None are to be &s;een with fire|arms out of their fief; and a per&s;on not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fief, though an officer in the army, is not to keep any. Not to mention many other re&s;trictions, the king has declared all fiefs to be his property; and whoever &s;hould undertake to maintain the contrary, mu&s;t make proof of it in the patent of inve&s;titure.</P>
<P>The high court of ju&s;tice, or the parliament, as we have already premi&s;ed, &s;its at Chambery. The king being, on account of Savoy, a member of the ancient kingdom of Arles; and a va&s;&s;al of the empire has a &s;eat, and vote, in the diet of the Germanic body.</P>
<P>In Savoy every one &s;peaks French; and mo&s;t of the names of towns and villages are of that language; but, in cu&s;toms and di&s;po&s;itions, the inhabitants have more of the German in them. It is with plea&s;ure we &s;ee in them, what is called, the old Germanic hone&s;ty. They are, one and all, Roman Catholics; but, with|out admitting the council of Trent. Their churches are no a&s;ylums. Montiers, in Tarentai&s;e, is an Arch|bi&s;hopric; and Annecy, ond Jean de Maurienne are Bi&s;hoprics.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III. PRINCIPALITY OF PIEDMONT.</HI> Situation, Climate, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>PIEDMONT is a part of the ancient Lombardy; and, northward, borders on Savoy and Italy; we&s;tward on France; Southward on the Mediterra|nean, and republic of Genoa; and ea&s;tward on the duchies of Mont&s;erat, and Milan. From South to North, it is about one hundred and fifty Engli&s;h miles; but much le&s;s from We&s;t to Ea&s;t. It is called Pied|mont, in Latin <HI>Pedemontium,</HI> from its &s;ituation <HI>ad pede montium,</HI> or at the foot of the mountains, or Alps, which &s;eparate France from Italy.</P>
<P>Some parts of it are very mountainous; but it is every where, and even among the hills, very unfruit|ful, That part of the country, which is level, is well watered by rivers and brooks. They have the good
<PB N="8" REF="9">
&s;en&s;e to make the be&s;t u&s;e of the&s;e, for the improve|ment of their meadows. From the Alps to the Ve|netian lagunes there is very little uncultivated land. A ridge of low hills, called <HI>La Collina,</HI> beginning not far from Turin, and continuing along the banks of the Po, for forty miles, is covered with hou&s;es and vine|yards; and enjoys delightful and exten&s;ive pro&s;pects. The <HI>Val d' Ao&s;ta</HI> is intere&s;ting to a naturali&s;t; for its copious quartz veins, with plenty of native gold; fine-grained lead ore, containing &s;ilver, &amp;c. red anti|mony; green lead ore, &amp;c. The hills produce plenty of wine; which, like all other Italian wines, is very lu&s;cious, whil&s;t new, e&s;pecially the white. Here is al&s;o a tarti&s;h red wine, called <HI>vino bri&s;co;</HI> and &s;aid to be very whole&s;ome for fat people; the &s;weet wine, or <HI>vino amabile,</HI> is, on the other hand, recommended as a &s;tomachic. The neighbourhood of Turin is famous for its fine fruits, and many long walks of che&s;nut and mulberry trees, productive both of plea&s;ure and profit. Marons, or large che&s;nuts, are a favourite dainty, among the commonalty, which are thrown into an oven, and, when thoroughly hot, and cooled in red wine, are dried a &s;econd time in the oven. The&s;e are called bi&s;cuits, and eaten cold. Truffles grow here in &s;uch abundance, as to gain Piedmont the ap|pellation of the truffle country. Some are black, others white, and marbled with red; the larger they are, the dearer; &s;ometimes they are found of twelve
<PB N="9" REF="10">
or fourteen pounds weight; and many country people earn, from &s;ixty to &s;eventy dollars a year, by digging only for truffles. The fine&s;t part of the king's country is that from Turin to Coni; which indeed has few to equal it. The fertility of Piedmont occa&s;ioned the old &s;aying, <HI>&s;i l'Italie etoit un mouton, le Piedmont en &s;eroit le rognon;</HI> that is, if Italy were a &s;heep, Pied|mont would be the kidney. The whole country, &s;ays <HI>Sharpe,</HI> is extremely fertile; and to &s;uch a degree, that it may be truly &s;aid there is not an acre of barren ground, throughout all the tract of Lombardy which we pa&s;&s;ed. The earth produces three crops at once; wine, &s;ilk and cotton. The mulberry-trees &s;upport the vines; and the corn grows in the intervals between the trees. This is certainly an in&s;tance of extraor|dinary plenty; but, probably, either of the&s;e products would be more perfect in their kind, if the &s;oil were appropriated to one or two of the&s;e only.</P>
<P>The chief river is the Po; which flows out of mount Vi&s;o, and bathes the walls of the capital, uniting it|&s;elf there with the Doria. The Var, anciently called Varus, ri&s;es in the county of Nice; and, after water|ing it, empties it&s;elf into the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>There are mountains, near Turin, adds Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> abounding with petrefactions, cry&s;talizations, and other natural curio&s;ities. Mu&s;hrooms, very large,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
petrified, who&s;e combs were not in the lea&s;t injured, are found in them; likewi&s;e &s;ea-&s;hells, &s;ea-fo&s;&s;ils, &amp;c. in great abundance, although they are full thirty leagues from the &s;ea. At about eight leagues from Turin, in the river Doria, the pea&s;ants find very pure gold among&s;t the &s;ands; which, when refined, is equal, in beauty and value, to that of &s;equins; but they do not find enough in a day, to make it worth their while to apply them&s;elves entirely to this re|&s;earch. However, I recollect, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> that we were met by a drove of mules, loaded with &s;mall ca&s;ks, which they &s;aid was the <HI>mineral&eacute;,</HI> containing the gold, and was, probably, &s;and, impregnated with the ore.</P>

river with the Doria. The approach to the city is magnificent, and the environs are beautiful; the neighbouring hills and eminences being covered with villas, convents, and other buildings. The four gates are highly ornamented. It is divided into the new town and old. The &s;treets in the new town are wide, &s;traight, and clean, having plenty of water running through them; they are well built, in a good ta&s;te, chiefly of brick &s;tuccoed; and generally terminating in &s;ome agreeable object. No inhabitant can rebuild, or repair his hou&s;e, but on a uniform plan, laid down by government for the improvement of the city. The <HI>Strada di Po,</HI> leading to the palace, is very &s;pacious, and has hand&s;ome porticos on each &s;ide; <HI>Strada nuovo &amp; della Dora gro&s;&s;a</HI> are al&s;o good &s;treets. The prin|cipal &s;quare, called <HI>di San Carlo,</HI> is large, and deco|rated, on two &s;ides, with porticos. It is pretty exten|&s;ive; the circuit of the ramparts being about four miles and a half. The number of inhabitants are com|puted at 80,000. In the city are forty-eight churches and convents, and &s;eventeen more may be &s;een from the ramparts. The mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;tructure is the front of the palace, where the king re&s;ides. It is built of free-&s;tone, and &s;uperbly decorated with pillars and marble &s;tatues, and a magnificent &s;tairca&s;e; where &s;tands a bra&s;s &s;tatue of <HI>Victor Amadoeus,</HI> on a hor&s;e of white marble. The re&s;t of the palace is old, and of brick, like the other palace. The royal library is
<PB N="12" REF="14">
worth notice. In the court chapel is &s;een the princi|pal relic, belonging either to the city, or the whole country; and that is the <HI>&s;udario,</HI> or linen cloth, in which the body of our Saviour was &s;aid to have been wrapped in the &s;epulchre. It is kept in a che&s;t, within a clo&s;et of gla&s;s doors.</P>
<P>This chapel, that it may be adapted to the tragical relic pre&s;erved there, is built entirely of a dark grey marble. The model was drawn by <HI>Guarini,</HI> and is &s;aid to have co&s;t four millions and a half of Piedmon|te&s;e livres. The &s;heet, (as the clergy here pretend) wherein <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was wrapped after his crucifixion, has, on both &s;ides of it, imprinted the bloody figure of a man. The &s;uppo&s;ed Sudary of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is al&s;o &s;hewn at Mentz, Li&s;bon, and in about twelve other Romi&s;h churches. To this objection the common an&s;wer is, that many pieces of linen were u&s;ed for wrapping round a corp&s;e; but this eva&s;ion holds good only as to the &s;maller bandages, u&s;ed for the arms, feet, and head; and not with re&s;pect to tho&s;e large <HI>involucra,</HI> on which the whole human figure is repre&s;ented. As to the great veneration at pre&s;ent paid to it, let it &s;uffice to &s;ay that <HI>Philip</HI> the Vth. of Spain, even when he mar|ried the Prince&s;s of Savoy, could not obtain a copy of that at Turin, till after repeated &s;olicitations, and then with the greate&s;t difficulty. The performance was al&s;o attended with a great number of &s;uper&s;titious ce|remonies.
<PB N="13" REF="15">
The painter, whil&s;t at work, was obliged to be continually on his knees, and eight bi&s;hops &s;aid ma&s;&s;es, at eight different altars.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t honourable di&s;tinction, at the court of Turin, is the order of the <HI>Annonciada;</HI> and next to that are the four following po&s;ts, called the four <HI>maitre|chargen;</HI> the great chamberlain, the &s;teward of the hou&s;hold, the ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, and the great hunt&s;|man. The&s;e four officers precede all others, and take place according to &s;eniority.</P>
<P>The order of the <HI>Annonciada</HI> was in&s;tituted in the year 1362. The knights wear a collar, about three fingers broad, of white and red ro&s;es, of enamelled gold. The&s;e letters F. E. R. T. are intermixt with love-knots; which has given &s;urmi&s;e, to &s;ome French writers, that this order was in&s;tituted only in honour of a favourite female. In like manner the order of the golden fleece has been a&s;per&s;ed, as having but a mean origin. The meaning of the four letters is &s;till a my&s;tery; &s;ome interpret them, <HI>Fortitudo Ejus Rho|dium Tenuit,</HI> "his courage pre&s;erved Rhodes," from a conjecture they were in&s;erted in the Savoy arms, by one of their dukes, on his relieving that i&s;land. Others have imagined the&s;e letters were part of the Savoy arms, long before that time. How the vowels A. E. I. O. U. adopted by <HI>Frederic</HI> the Third, for the hou&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="16">
of Au&s;tria have puzzled the learned, is &s;ufficiently known; and no le&s;s have they been perplexed about the old device of the Margrave of Saluzzo, <HI>viz.</HI> the letters N. O. C. H. which &s;ome one at la&s;t jocularly interpreted thus, <HI>Non Omnes Capiunt Hoc, i, e.</HI> all men do not under&s;tand this.</P>
<P>Every knight of the <HI>Annonciada</HI> mu&s;t previou&s;ly have been of the order of St. <HI>Maurice,</HI> in&s;tituted in 1434. The knights of St. <HI>Maurice</HI> mu&s;t marry but once; and then it mu&s;t not be to a widow. The king is grand ma&s;ter of the order of the <HI>Annonciada;</HI> the king's &s;on, and the fir&s;t prince of the blood, are knights by birth; and the number of the others is not to exceed fifteen.</P>
<P>Contiguous to the royal palace are &s;everal other &s;pacious buildings; among others the opera-hou&s;e is accounted a ma&s;ter piece of its kind; the record-office, with the new royal printing-hou&s;e, with twelve pre&s;&s;es, and the ar&s;enal, which is quite new, and a well con|trived &s;tructure. This building, be&s;ides the armories u&s;ually found in &s;uch places, contains a cabinet of mi|nerals, a good chemical laboratory, a library of books, in mineralogy and metallurgy, and furnaces for ca&s;t|ing cannon; here al&s;o are mathematical, mechanical, and other ma&s;ters, for the in&s;truction of engineers, miners, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">The fortifications of Turin are regular, and kept in excellent repair. The citadel is a regular pentagon, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;trong ba&s;tions; and is reputed one of the &s;tronge&s;t in Europe. The glacis is planted with trees, forming three avenues; that in the middle very wide for carriages, and one on each &s;ide for walking; they extend to the Suza gate, between the fo&s;&s;&eacute; and the city.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity, which was founded in 1405, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed on a better footing by <HI>Victor Amadoeus</HI> II. is a large quadrangle, and one of the fir&s;t buildings in the city. In the inner court is a double row of piazzas, over each other; and along them &s;everal an|cient monuments, placed on the walls. The univer&s;ity library, be&s;ides twenty thou&s;and printed volumes, has a very valuable collection of ancient manu&s;cripts, hi|therto unknown, and of great u&s;e, both in civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory. <HI>Pyrrhus Ligorius</HI>'s collection of de&s;igns of Greek and Roman antiquities, in thirty volumes, for which 8,000 ducats were given, is an in|valuable ornament to this collection. The Je&s;uits have a college and a church, adorned with mo&s;t cu|rious fre&s;co painting, and marble &s;culpture. There are five ho&s;pitals for the &s;ick, maimed, and poor; that of St. <HI>John,</HI> the large&s;t and fine&s;t, is, in reality, a magnificent &s;tructure. The <HI>Charit&eacute;,</HI> or poor-hou&s;e, is a mo&s;t noble foundation. The receptacle for luna|tics
<PB N="16" REF="18">
is likewi&s;e worthy of ob&s;ervation. The &s;treets are kept clean by a rivulet, brought from the river Doria into the city. It al&s;o carries off all the &s;oil and filth from the kennels, and is very &s;erviceable in ca&s;e of fire. The &s;luices are laid open every night.</P>
<P>This charming town, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Piozzi,</HI> is the <HI>&s;alon</HI> of Italy; but it is a fine proportioned, and well orna|mented <HI>&s;alon,</HI> happily con&s;tructed to call in fre&s;h air, at the end of every &s;treet. The arches formed to de|fend pa&s;&s;engers from the rain and &s;un, which here might have even &s;erious effects, from their violence, de&s;erve much prai&s;e; while their architecture, uniting our ideas of beauty and comfort, form a traveller's ta&s;te; and teach him to admire that perfection, of which a miniature may certainly be found at Turin.</P>
<P>The king's palace is in a &s;imple, and noble &s;tile of architecture. The apartments are elegantly fitted up, and furni&s;hed; no expence has been &s;pared; a pro|fu&s;ion of gla&s;&s;es, gilding, rich &s;ilks and velvets over the walls. The floors are beautifully inlaid with woods of different &s;hades; and kept, as are the whole of the apartments and furniture, delicately clean. The frames of the looking gla&s;&s;es, and of the &s;conces, are all wrought plate, as well as the arms that hold the candles, and the &s;hapes of the pier-gla&s;&s;es; large ma&s;|&s;ive tables of &s;ilver &s;tand under each gla&s;s, all wrought
<PB N="17" REF="19">
in bas reliefs; and the workman&s;hip, for the mo&s;t part, finely executed. The lu&s;tres that hang from the ciel|ing are of rock cry&s;tal. The curtains to the doors have a fine effect; for when all the doors, which lead through the magnificent &s;uit of rooms, are thrown open, the&s;e curtains are tied back, and their folds form beautiful arcades. The doors open in the middle, and, folding inward, are received into grooves made in the thickne&s;s of the wall; the pannels are carved and gilt; and, when the apartment is di&s;played, no door is to be &s;een; but in pa&s;&s;ing through the door-ca&s;e, the ornaments of the doors, which cover the &s;ides of the wall, are very &s;triking. The&s;e doors, all an|&s;wering each other, form a per&s;pective which has a mo&s;t beautiful effect. As the &s;uite of rooms form a rectangle, there is a view, from the &s;ame point, of two exten&s;ive vi&s;tas; which, being terminated by looking-gla&s;&s;es, &s;eems to have no end. Silk is the furniture of the &s;ummer; that of the winter apartment is of crim|&s;on velvet. As the walls are extremely thick, the windows have a noble air from the in&s;ide; the wall &s;loping off from them, and the tops arched in cove|fa&s;hion, are incru&s;ted with looking-gla&s;&s;es &s;et in gilt foliage; which, by their reflections, produce a brilliant effect. Sculpture and gilding abound in every room; all the mouldings, architraves, and every (the &s;malle&s;t) part of wain&s;coting, is highly ornamented. But what is wonderfully &s;hocking, in the mid&s;t of all this profu|&s;ion
<PB N="18" REF="20">
of finery, is, that the panes of the windows are &s;et in lead, in the &s;ame manner with the ca&s;ements of our Engli&s;h cottages. The palace contains fifty-three chambers; of which forty-eight are completely fur|ni&s;hed. The cielings are painted by <HI>Daniele di Sanc|terre</HI> and others. In the gallery is a collection of pictures, among which are many good ones, chiefly by Flemi&s;h ma&s;ters; they are all hung upon black pannels; great part of the&s;e were purcha&s;ed from Prince <HI>Eu|gene</HI>'s cabinet, by the late King. The drop&s;ical wo|man, with her phy&s;ician, is, by connoi&s;&s;eurs, valued at &pound;. 10,000; it is fini&s;hed with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Dutch nicety, by <HI>Gerard Dowe.</HI> This picture, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;ley,</HI> is reckoned his ma&s;ter-piece, both for de&s;ign and colouring. It appears on the &s;ide like a cupboard; and is &s;hut in by two doors, on which are painted, by <HI>Gerard Dowe,</HI> a ewer and a napkin. When the&s;e doors are opened, the picture appears with more <HI>eclat,</HI> from having been concealed. It repre&s;ents the in&s;ide of a room; the <HI>clair ob&s;cure</HI> has a beautiful effect; the room is lighted by an ox-eye over the window, and by the light proceeding from the fire in a chimney; which is admirably thrown on the furniture and other ob|jects. The principal figure appears to be a phy&s;ician, who is &s;tanding on the fore-ground, and holds up a phial to the light, which he looks at very attentively; he is dre&s;&s;ed in a prodigious fine lilac-coloured &s;attin night-gown; the drop&s;ical woman is very fine al&s;o, in
<PB N="19" REF="21">
white &s;attin; her daughter's dre&s;s is not neglected; &s;he is on her knees near her mother, and holds one of her hands in hers. There is great tenderne&s;s ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the countenance of the daughter, and her attitude is ea&s;y and natural; the mother appears to be in the la&s;t &s;tage of illne&s;s. A waiting-maid, who is ad|mini&s;tering a potion to the &s;ick lady, has a &s;tupid in|difference in her manners, that forms a good contra&s;t to the filial piety, and tender attention of the daughter. This picture may be &s;aid to be too highly fini&s;hed; the &s;attin, lace, embroidery, are done too well; which cau&s;es a hardne&s;s of outline, in many places, by an extraordinary attention to the fini&s;hing of &s;everal pieces of furniture in the room.</P>
<P>In a cabinet, highly ornamented with gla&s;s, and beautiful gilt foliage, are a va&s;t number of miniatures; all portraits. The&s;e pictures are di&s;per&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, among the gla&s;s and foliage, as to have a &s;in|gular and very pretty effect. They are incomparably well executed on ivory; none hatched, all dotted, and bear the te&s;t of the highe&s;t magnifying gla&s;s. They are painted by one man, named <HI>Carameli,</HI> a monk; his own picture among them. In&s;tead of u&s;ing a ca|mel's-hair pencil, which is univer&s;al in miniature paint|ing, this man dotted all his pictures, with the feathers plucked from woodcocks' wings; and, in&s;tead of fini&s;h|ing as he went on, he began them nearly at the &s;ame
<PB N="20" REF="22">
time, and worked at each, every day, till they were all completed. It &s;eems no hair-pencils can be brought to the point that the&s;e pencils have naturally. <HI>Carmeli</HI> took thirty years to fini&s;h them, and had never learnt.</P>
<P>Among&s;t many remarkable portraits, that of Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI> is much admired. There are al&s;o two original portraits; one of <HI>Petrarch,</HI> the other of his beloved <HI>Laura,</HI> by <HI>Brongino,</HI> a famous painter of that day. Her &s;ort of beauty, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> would never have captivated me, had I been <HI>Petrarch.</HI> Her hair is red, her eyebrows extremely narrow and exact, forming a flat arch; her eyes &s;mall, her no&s;e a little hooked, and ri&s;ing too high in the middle; her mouth not very &s;mall, and lips like two &s;carlet threads; a very faint colour in her cheeks, the <HI>contour</HI> in the face more &s;quare than oval; her countenance more de|mure than engaging. As for <HI>Petrarch,</HI> he is exceed|ingly ugly indeed; but he has a very &s;en&s;ible black and yellow face. It is remarkable that, in this collection of pictures, there is no <HI>Raphael,</HI> except &s;ome defaced &s;ketches; but one <HI>Titian,</HI> and not one of <HI>Salvator Ro&s;a,</HI> nor <HI>Corregio.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;tatues and bu&s;ts are part of the wreck of the Gonzagua collection; brought from Mantua, on the pillage of that city. The celebrated I&s;iac table is in the chamber of the archives; this is one of the mo&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="23">
celebrated antiques in all Italy. This &s;lab, or table, is of copper; it is covered all over with hieroglyphics. The principal figure is an <HI>I&s;is,</HI> &s;itting; &s;he has a kind of hawk on her head, and the horns of a bull. Many and various are the conjectures, formed by the learned, in regard to the meaning of the figures upon the table. Some have imagined they could prove it to be a com|pa&s;s; others, a perpetual calendar; and, not a few, have pretended to find principles of philo&s;ophy and and politics in it; while &s;ome, &s;till more ingenious, have pretended that it contains a complete body of theology. I am not impertinent enough to pretend I di&s;covered any thing more than a &s;trange chaos of men, women, ugly birds, and other animals, frightfully delineated, by &s;trait lines, &s;ometimes &s;pringing all from a point, like rays, then &s;uddenly turning into angular figures, formed by &s;ilver, incru&s;ted into copper. It is evident much &s;ilver has been taken out of this table, as the grooves remain. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming confu&s;ion of the repre&s;entations, the &s;ilver lines are very neat, and extremely well in&s;erted into the copper.</P>
<P>The archives are arranged with &s;uch method, that, although they are extremely voluminous, the King can, at a moment, turn to the population, extent, and pro|ductions, of the &s;malle&s;t &s;ubdivi&s;ion of his hereditary dominions; or of tho&s;e acquired by him, at the con|clu&s;ion of the war in 1744, commonly called <HI>Le pa&iuml;s
<PB N="22" REF="24">
conquis;</HI> their pre&s;ent and pa&s;t revenue, at, or for any given period, within the two la&s;t centuries, by the day, week, or year; their capability of bearing a further increa&s;e of taxes, in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity; their value and ca&s;ual increa&s;e, or decrea&s;e, in different branches of manufactures, as well as the number of militia, and of recruits, which each can furni&s;h upon any emergency.</P>
<P>The King's theatre adjoins to the royal palace, and is reckoned one of the fine&s;t in Europe. It is &s;trik|ingly magnificent. The form is that of an egg cut acro&s;s. There are &s;ix rows of boxes; narrow indeed in front, but very convenient within; and holds eight per&s;ons with ea&s;e. The Italians play at cards, receive vi&s;its, and take all &s;orts of refre&s;hment in their boxes; they re&s;emble little rooms, rather than boxes at a the|atre. There are no benches; but, what is more con|venient, chairs, which are moved about at plea&s;ure. The king's box is in the &s;econd row, fronting the &s;tage; it is thirty feet wide, Paris mea&s;ure; and the back part, covered with looking-gla&s;s, reflects the &s;tage in &s;uch a manner, that tho&s;e who happen to have their backs turned to the actors, either conver&s;ing or at play, may &s;ee the performance in the gla&s;&s;es. The&s;e gla&s;&s;es form a partition, which can be moved when|ever they chu&s;e to enlarge the box; there being room behind. The very great breadth of the &s;tage pro|duces
<PB N="23" REF="25">
a mo&s;t noble effect. The <HI>Pro&s;cenium</HI> mea&s;ures forty-five Paris feet, the depth of the &s;tage one hun|dred and five; beyond which they can add a paved court of twenty-four feet. A gentle ri&s;ing is contrived at the &s;ides; by which may be introduced triumphal cars, for great proce&s;&s;ions, hor&s;es, &amp;c. They can al&s;o throw a draw-bridge acro&s;s, when the &s;cene re|quires it; and they have a contrivance for letting in water, &s;o as to pre&s;ent a <HI>jet d'eau</HI> of thirty feet high. Sixty hor&s;es at a time have been brought upon the &s;tage, and manoeuvred, with ea&s;e, in repre&s;entations of battles; the orche&s;tra is &s;o curiou&s;ly con&s;tructed, as by having a place left underneath, which is concave and &s;emicircular, to augment the &s;ound of the in&s;truments very con&s;iderably. The machinery and decorations are magnificent. The King is at the principal ex|pence of the opera; they who have boxes paying only two or three guineas for the &s;ea&s;on, as a kind of fee; money being only taken at the door for &s;itting in the pit.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t buildings in this city, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> are Count <HI>Pae&s;anes'</HI> hotel, which co&s;t fifty thou&s;and pounds; and the Carignan palace, built by <HI>Guarini.</HI> This architect al&s;o de&s;igned the new building, and alterations, at La Veniere; be&s;ides many others. The&s;e expen&s;ive improvements are not a little pro|moted by an ordinance, which empowers every one,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
intending to re-build, or enlarge his hou&s;e, to oblige his next neighbour, who&s;e hou&s;e is of le&s;s value than it is propo&s;ed the new one &s;hall be, to di&s;po&s;e of the whole, or part of the ground plot to him, at a rea&s;on|able rate. That part of the palace of the Prince of Piedmont, which is modern, is fronted in the mo&s;t or|namental manner, by <HI>Philip Juvara;</HI> and is in the be&s;t &s;tile of architecture of any building in Turin. The &s;tairca&s;e is admired here to &s;uch a degree, that they a&s;&s;ert it to be the fir&s;t in the world; it is double, and unites at top; at which is the entrance into the grand &s;aloon. The apartments are well furni&s;hed, and would appear much more grand and con&s;iderable, were it not for the &s;tairca&s;e; the noble appearance of which indicates a more magnificent and exten&s;ive &s;uit of rooms.</P>
<P>As to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical buildings in this city, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> they are much inferior to the others, for they are very ancient; whereas the fine&s;t edifices at Turin were built in the two la&s;t reigns. The city of A&s;ti, in the road to Genoa, exceeded Turin formerly, and the churches there are in the Gothic ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Among the laudable foundations at Turin, the ho&s;|pital <HI>de la Charit&eacute;</HI> merits being noticed; this building takes up great part of the Rue de Po; and has very large revenues ari&s;ing from rents, and the annual
<PB N="25" REF="27">
&s;ub&s;criptions of the citizens. The king every year gives to this ho&s;pital three hundred &s;acks of corn; three of which are computed to make a &s;ufficient quan|tity of bread to &s;erve one per&s;on a whole year. In this hou&s;e are generally two thou&s;and, and often three thou&s;and, poor people, picked out of the &s;treets, and employed in &s;everal &s;orts of manufactures. Here the young and old, of both &s;exes, are furni&s;hed with a re|medy again&s;t idlene&s;s; and are provided with meat, drink, and cloathing; and attendance, when &s;ick, or grown decrepid with age. Forty &s;oldiers in blue, with red bandeliers, are daily di&s;per&s;ed about the &s;treets, to take up all beggars and vagrants; if they be fo|reigners, after undergoing a &s;hort impri&s;onment, they are driven out of the city; and, for a &s;econd offence, be&s;ides undergoing a long impri&s;onment, they are whipped, and bani&s;hed out of the country; but the natives are immediately brought away to the ho&s;pital. The main building con&s;i&s;ts of two quadrangles, with galleries round them; one for the men, and the other for the women. They dine &s;eparately, in their re&s;pec|tive halls, to the number of &s;ome hundreds at a time, in each apartment. The two &s;exes have al&s;o their particular time for hearing ma&s;s, and are &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the congregation by an iron grate.</P>
<P>Piedmont will pre&s;erve the memory of King <HI>Victor,</HI> as France pre&s;erves that of <HI>Louis</HI> XIV. Turin every

where di&s;playing that Prince's magnificence. Near half this city was built by him, on an uniform plan; the better part of the fortifications, the gates, the ho&s;|pital, the univer&s;ity, the country college, &s;everal royal &s;eats in the neighbourhood, are works of his reign; la&s;tly, for his burial-place, he has erected a &s;plendid church, where a numerous community of &s;ecular prie&s;ts officiate. This church &s;tands on the top of a high mountain, Ea&s;t of Turin, and was built in pur&s;uance of a vow made by him, when Turin was be&s;ieged by the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> in 1706; that he would, if victorious, erect a church on that &s;pot, from which, with Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> he had ob&s;erved the di&s;tribution of the operations of the enemy's troops before the town.</P>
<P>It is called the Superga; the a&s;cent to it is &s;o ex|tremely rapid and difficult, even now, that it &s;eems to have been almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for human art and addre&s;s, to have brought together the materials here employed. The front pre&s;ents a fine portico, above which, to a very great height, ri&s;es a dome, crowned by a cupola; on each &s;ide is a &s;teeple, fini&s;hed up to a point. The entrance to the church is noble, and the in&s;ide very &s;triking; it is quite round, and richly ornamented with pillars of the Corinthian order, of grey marble, four feet and a half each in diameter. Here is a great profu&s;ion of fine marble, the walls
<PB N="27" REF="29">
being incru&s;ted with it. Piedmont affords a prodi|gious variety; one &s;ort, peculiar to this country, is re|markably beautiful, being veined in &s;hades of brown and yellow, like what is commonly called in England, Egyptian pebble. From the cupola, a pro&s;pect of an amazing extent opens it&s;elf on all &s;ides. In a clear day Milan appears in view; the rivers Po, Doria, I&s;turia, meandering along, form i&s;lands without num|ber. The variety of tints this pro&s;pect pre&s;ents is wonderful; the riche&s;t green pa&s;turage in the vallies, hills cloathed with vines, mountains covered with &s;now, together with the city of Turin and all its en|virons. The pre&s;ent King &s;aid, in viewing Turin, from this height,&mdash;"It is well &s;trangers do not &s;ee Turin, for the fir&s;t time, from the top of Superga, or they would have but a mean opinion of my town." It is wonderful how very incon&s;iderable Turin ap|pears, though it cannot be above two Engli&s;h miles di&s;tant, in a &s;tra it line. The late King would not permit the road to be made commodious up to the Superga, in his reign. Probably his rea&s;on might have been, to demon&s;trate to tho&s;e who a&s;cend it, the trouble and expence attendant upon the convey|ance of materials for the building. At pre&s;ent, it is not too good, nor is it as well as it might be, although much has been done. The &s;oil is a &s;tiff clay, which makes the a&s;cending of the mountain very fatiguing and trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30">The palace mo&s;t frequented by the royal family is La Venerie; the court generally continuing there from Spring to December. It is about a league from Turin. The road that leads to it is well paved, and the greate&s;t part of it planted with trees on each &s;ide; it is not always in a direct line, but runs a little winding between fine meadows, fields, and vineyards. At a quarter of a league di&s;tance from the city, is the <HI>campagne de notre Dame;</HI> when, in 1706, the French trenches, now marked by &s;tones between the fields, were forced. This palace is much admired by the Turine&s;e, and the French, for its architecture, gardens, &amp;c. Before the King's palace is a &s;treet of hou&s;es, built of &s;tone, and inhabited by private per|&s;ons. The palace is not yet completed. In two chambers, adjoining to the King's apartment, are the pictures of thirty of his Maje&s;ty's ance&s;tors, with Latin in&s;criptions, &s;ignifying their mo&s;t famous at|chievements. Beyond the&s;e is the chamber of pic|tures, of the Emperors of Germany, another of the Kings of France, and another of the Kings of Eng|land, from the Saxon line, down to Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> The portrait of <HI>Elizabeth</HI> appears to be greatly flat|tered; &s;he appears to be about eighteen years of age, with fine large black eyes and black hair, and that beau|tiful complexion, the French call <HI>brune clair.</HI> The&s;e portraits are all as big as life. In another apartment are a great many eque&s;trian portraits, chiefly women.
<PB N="29" REF="31">
The&s;e Amazons are dre&s;&s;ed in the Spani&s;h fa&s;hion, and mounted on prancing hor&s;es. Each lady is drawn properly dre&s;&s;ed for the chace; and, as all their hats and riding-dre&s;&s;es are much alike, they are di&s;|tingui&s;hed by &s;ilk bridles to their hor&s;es, of different colours: this was really an order of the late King, that he might be able to di&s;tingui&s;h them from one another at a little di&s;tance. Among others is the picture of the famous Counte&s;s of <HI>Verue.</HI> This lady was, for a long time, the reigning favourite at the court of Turin, with the late Monarch; from which place &s;he had the addre&s;s to e&s;cape, and carried with her jewels and other valuables to a great amount. Her e&s;cape was planned with infinite addre&s;s, to avoid detection. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned was, an apprehen&s;ion of a change in the King's affections, in which ca&s;e &s;he would have been immured in a nunnery for life. <HI>Key&s;ler</HI> mentions having vi&s;ited her afterwards in Paris, where &s;he lived in great &s;plendor and mag|nificence. It &s;eems, from one or two anecdotes, re|lated by the above author, in which our countrymen were concerned, this lady had given no &s;mall rea&s;on to excite the jealou&s;y of the King: an Engli&s;h noble|man having been near pa&s;&s;ing the night under the Counte&s;s's bed. It &s;eems he had been di&s;turbed in in his vi&s;its by the unexpected arrival of the King; and there was no other place &s;o proper for conceal|ment. He was di&s;covered; and this nobleman's
<PB N="30" REF="32">
&s;ituation, in a country where rivalry is no light of|fence, was &s;omething more than di&s;agreeable; but his Maje&s;ty's genero&s;ity &s;corned to re&s;ent it&s;elf on any man, at a di&s;advantage. Another time, this &s;ame nobleman found the King knew how to get rid of &s;uch gue&s;ts as came without invitation; for the King intending another unexpected vi&s;it to the Counte&s;s, u&s;ed &s;uch precautions, that before &s;he knew any thing of his coming, he was in her chamber, where he found my Lord &s;itting with her at table. His re&s;entment, however, went no further, than taking a light in each hand, and making a &s;ign to him, who readily complied, fearing wor&s;e con&s;equences; he lighted him down &s;tairs; there the King very coolly &s;aid to him, "that he might now boa&s;t of having been lighted down &s;tairs by the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> but that he ad|vi&s;ed him, as a friend, never to &s;hew his face there again." Of this advice, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> he was &s;o very ob&s;ervant, that he &s;et out the next day to fini&s;h his travels. Another of our young hopeful nobility, being al&s;o enamoured with the Counte&s;s, indulged his fancy &s;o far, as to look at her through a &s;pying-gla&s;s, during the whole time of an opera. As little agree|able as this mu&s;t be to the King, his manner of &s;ending away this <HI>Lors Anglois,</HI> cannot be charged with &s;everity. The next day two men were appointed to follow our young nobleman wherever he went, who&s;e &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s it was to be looking at him with
<PB N="31" REF="33">
&s;pying gla&s;&s;es. It was not till after two days, that he took notice of the&s;e new attendants; and, being at no lo&s;s to account for the meaning of their behaviour, he thought it advi&s;eable to leave Turin immediately, and look out for adventures el&s;ewhere. When his Maje&s;ty was informed of the Counte&s;s's elopement, he was heard to &s;ay, that he never was engaged with any woman who did not deceive him, and avoided the &s;ex ever after: a &s;peech which &s;eems to be a little &s;evere; as it appears, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> from un|que&s;tionable authority, that when the allies intended to deprive the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> of the kingdom of Sicily, he was advi&s;ed of it by the Counte&s;s, from Paris, &s;ooner than they could have wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>But to return to La Venerie; the Orangerie is much e&s;teemed for its architecture; it is 582 feet long, 51 broad, and 40 high; the front is ornamented with pillars of the Ionic order. The &s;tables al&s;o are very beautiful, and &s;eem to be to the full as large as the Orangerie; they contain two hundred hor&s;es. The gardens were laid out by a Frenchman; one would think, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> this good man had taken his idea of planting gardens from &s;ome of <HI>Euclid</HI>'s prob|lems. They are of great extent; the walks all &s;trait, and cutting each other at right angles, leaving &s;quare plantations, and quarters of beech and beech-wood, frequently inter&s;ected by narrow alleys, &s;o that they
<PB N="32" REF="34">
form triangular figures, wounding the eye by their uniformity. As all the&s;e right lines produce what is called &s;tars, of one kind or other; and in the cop|pices are great plenty of phea&s;ants, hares, and <HI>chev|reuils,</HI> where his Maje&s;ty amu&s;es him&s;elf with <HI>la cha&s;&s;e a fu&s;il.</HI> Taking part in the centre of the &s;tar, where many of the&s;e angles meet, he is &s;ecure of much &s;port; the <HI>piqueurs</HI> enter the quarters and drive out the game; who cro&s;&s;ing the alley, &s;eek the oppo&s;ite problem; mean-time the King lets fly at them, and knocks them down at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>What plea&s;ed me mo&s;t at La Venerie, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> is the royal chapel, de&s;igned by <HI>Filippo.</HI> The cupola, is of a graceful height; within this chapel are &s;tatues of St. <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI> St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom,</HI> St. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> and St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> &s;tanding on red, green, and yellow marble pede&s;tals. The &s;tatues are of white marble, in the gigantic ta&s;te, and were brought here from Rome. The high altar is a glorious fight; and there is &s;carce any kind of marble not to be &s;een in this chapel, either in the pillars or altars.</P>
<P>Rivoli is another royal palace, about three leagues from Turin, towards Su&s;a. The whole road runs in a direct line, through fields, meadows, and vineyards; it was planted &s;ince the &s;iege of Turin, in the year 1712; the French, among other deva&s;tations, having
<PB N="33" REF="35">
rooted up every tree throughout the country. This walk yields a very beautiful pro&s;pect; and at one end, &s;tands the palace of Rivoli, on an eminence; and at the other, Turin; and about two leagues be|yond that, in a &s;trait line, the &s;tately church of Su|perga. The air is continually clear and healthy, and creates a &s;harp appetite; but, on account of its &s;ubtilty and keenne&s;s, is not &s;o agreeable to &s;leep in.</P>
<P>The palace of Valentin was formerly the &s;cene of mo&s;t of the court diver&s;ions and entertainments; it lies ju&s;t without the walls of Turin. This palace is &s;o called, as may be &s;een in the memoirs of the Count <HI>de Grammont,</HI> from the title given to tho&s;e gentlemen, who, on St. <HI>Valentine's</HI> day, wait upon the ladies; it being a general cu&s;tom all over Italy, for &s;ingle women to choo&s;e &s;ome one, among their male friends and acquaintances, on that day, who is to gallant them wherever they go; and who, to di&s;charge his office with honour, mu&s;t pre&s;ent them with no&s;egays, and other bagatelles. This attendance, which expires at the year's end, is not liable to any exception; and is often terminated by marriage. The parents, in the mean-time, are very watchful over their daughters' behaviour; and things are generally conducted with &s;o much decorum and honour, that even the monks them&s;elves make no &s;cruple to take upon them the office of a Valentine; and, po&s;&s;ibly it is nobody's
<PB N="34" REF="36">
intere&s;t &s;o much as theirs to recommend the inno|cence of the&s;e intercour&s;e between the &s;exes. But, as their Valentine gallantries are entirely left off at court, &s;o the palace at Valentin is al&s;o neglected.</P>
<P>About a &s;mall league from Turin, by the &s;ide of the road, grows a very large elm-tree; beneath the &s;hadow of who&s;e &s;preading branches, the late King, when Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> held a council of war with Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Anhalt,</HI> and the Mar|quis <HI>de Prie,</HI> a Piedmonte&s;e General, on the 5th September 1706, in which they determined upon the manner and attack of the French lines: this event took place on the 7th of the &s;ame month; in which famous action the French army was entirely routed, Mar&s;hal <HI>Mar&s;in</HI> killed, and the &s;iege of Turin rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>The mar&s;hal died two hours after the battle, often repeating the&s;e words, <HI>Tout e&s;t perdu mais Je n'en &s;uis pas la cau&s;e.</HI> "All is lo&s;t, but not owing to me." Of fifteen thou&s;and pri&s;oners, mo&s;t of them died with hunger and hard&s;hips. This &s;iege la&s;ted four months and a half; and the breach on the &s;ide of the citadel was &s;o wide, that a whole battalion in front might have marched into it; the only re&s;ource left the be&s;ieged was, to keep a large fire burning continually in the breach. All uten&s;ils, and furniture made of wood, were u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e; and, in &s;everal parts of
<PB N="35" REF="37">
the city, the roofs of the hou&s;es were pulled down for the &s;ake of the wood for fuel; and, by the&s;e means, the breach was defended till the town was relieved. The King of Sardinia, during that &s;iege, was at his la&s;t ga&s;p; and, after the victory, was reported, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of joy, to have &s;aid, "He was very near being obliged to dance attendance in the Emperor's anti-chamber.</P>
<P>Near the capuchin mona&s;tery, on the mountain, a fine villa, called <HI>La v&igrave;gne de Madame Royale,</HI> &s;tands upon an eminence. <HI>Bernini,</HI> the famous architect and &s;culptor, u&s;ed to reckon this building the be&s;t in, or near, Turin. During the minority, under the regent <HI>Chri&s;tina,</HI> both the hou&s;e and garden were often the &s;cenes of riot and debauchery. On this account, in the King's advanced age, when he was as it were inflamed with an eternal zeal for religion, the place became &s;o odious to him, that, upon the death of <HI>Ma|dame Royale,</HI> he be&s;towed it upon an ho&s;pital. The directors, in hopes to make a great deal of money by the &s;ale of the materials, began to pull it down; but the profits falling &s;hort of their expectations, a &s;top was put to the demolition of it; &s;o that now the hou&s;e makes a very de&s;olate appearance.</P>
<P>In the environs of this city, the fir&s;t &s;pot vi&s;ited by every &s;tranger is the airing-place, or cor&s;o, called the
<PB N="36" REF="38">
<HI>Valentin;</HI> this is an avenue, formed by four rows of lo&s;ty trees, conducting to the palace, which is at the end, and &s;ituated at the borders of the Po. There are al&s;o other avenues; one of which leads to the church, called the Servites. The royal family, and almo&s;t every body at Turin, who are not bed-rid, lying-in, or dying, make their appearance in the&s;e avenues every day, from the hours of five or &s;ix until &s;even; when they change their ground to another avenue, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the&s;e, and very near the citadel. This they leave at eight, for the theatre, or &s;ome pri|vate a&s;&s;embly. Tho&s;e who cannot afford to keep equipages are here on foot; and, let the weather be fine or rainy, the coaches never fail to come. The royal family make a noble appearance, particularly the coach of the Duche&s;s of Savoy, which is very mag|nificent; &s;he drives with eight hor&s;es, and a con&s;ider|able <HI>cort&eacute;ge,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of her ladies, pages, &amp;c. in other carriages; all conducted with the utmo&s;t dignity and tranquility. The young princes frequently alight and walk; and the prince&s;&s;es &s;ometimes amu&s;e them&s;elves with walking in the gardens of the palace of Valentin. The coaches, in general, are very &s;plendid, and make a brilliant appearance; the ladies, likewi&s;e, are decked out for this daily parade in all their finery.</P>
<P>The &s;etting out of the cavalcade for the royal chace, from the palace of Stupenige, another of the King's
<PB N="37" REF="39">
hunting &s;eats, about &s;ix miles from Turin, is a fine &s;ight. The chai&s;es of the court precede all others, agreeable to e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>etiquette.</HI> The Duche&s;s of Savoy goes fir&s;t, the elder prince&s;&s;es next, and &s;o on; then come the amba&s;&s;adors, foreign mini&s;ters, &amp;c. The livery of the hunt is &s;carlet, richly laced with &s;ilver. Whoever is well-born, (a gentleman inde|pendant of trade, and &s;ome of the profe&s;&s;ions) what is called here, and in all the&s;e countries, <HI>noble&s;&s;e,</HI> is permitted to be of the hunt; and wearing the livery may breakfa&s;t with the king at Stupenige. This fa|vour extends al&s;o to &s;trangers, properly introduced at court. There are very fine ridings cut through the fore&s;t, adjacent to the palace, and it is plen|tifully &s;tocked with game. The great number of hunt&s;men, with the gay appearance of the whole ca|valcade, upon a fine day, has, in appearance, the ad|vantage of any other chace. The gentlemen are on hor&s;eback, and the ladies of the court all in po&s;tchai&s;es, with two wheels, conveyed by po&s;t-hor&s;es; and there are relays, in different parts of the fore&s;t, for a change. The chacers belong to the court, and are all alike, rather plain than ornamented; but neatly made, and as fit for the purpo&s;e of hunting as any carriages can be. The &s;ound of the French-horns, repeated by the echos, with the cry of the hounds, and the &s;houts of the men, contribute not a little to animate this &s;cene. Upon the conclu&s;ion of the hunt, all the chai&s;es are
<PB N="38" REF="40">
drawn up in form of an amphitheatre; the gentlemen of the court and hunt then di&s;mount, and conver&s;e with the ladies; while the &s;tag is embowelled, and the entrails di&s;tributed to the dogs. The duche&s;s then generally &s;ends a foot of the &s;tag, with &s;ome gracious compliment, to any &s;tranger at the hunt, whom &s;he means to honour; as was done to Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> from whom we extracted this narration of the royal chace.</P>
<P>No royal family in Europe are more rigid ob&s;ervers of the laws of <HI>etiquette,</HI> than that of Sardinia; all their movements are uniform and invariable. The hour of ri&s;ing, of going to ma&s;s, of taking the air; every thing is regulated like clock-work. The King gives audiences from &s;ix to eleven, every morning; goes to ma&s;s about twenty minutes before twelve; dines at half after twelve; takes an afternoon's airing; and &s;ups &s;o exactly at ten, that he leaves the opera, &s;ome|times, a few minutes before it is fini&s;hed, if it exceeds ever &s;o little the hour of ten.</P>
<P>The King's table is plentiful, but plain; every ar|ticle is furni&s;hed by purveyors, at a moderate rate. What remains from his table is &s;erved to the Lords and Ladies of the bedchamber; and, from them, down to the equeries, pages, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">Employments, at the court of Turin, are e&s;teemed as giving con&s;ideration and precedence, rather than for their pecuniary value; no appointment here is &s;uf|ficient to &s;upport the rank with any tolerable degree of decency.</P>

<P>THE women are extremely beautiful and fair in this country; though, indeed, the ladies of Mi|lan and Venice almo&s;t vie with them, in complexion and features. They have the white&s;t &s;kin, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> of any women I ever &s;aw. They never wear <HI>rouge,</HI> which is &s;omething more extraordinary. They dre&s;s well, and are &s;ingulary genteel in their undre&s;&s;es. If they are gallant, they conduct them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t decency; and incon&s;tancy is looked upon as the greate&s;t of crimes. Friend&s;hips of twenty and thirty years are not uncommon; at the &s;ame time it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed there are no coquettes; but the
<PB N="40" REF="42">
court &s;ets &s;o virtuous an example, that the utmo&s;t pre|caution and circum&s;pection is nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who have any thing to conceal.</P>
<P>The Piedmonte&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> are accounted lively, artful, and witty; the inhabitants of the moun|tains of Ao&s;ta excepted, who are further di&s;tingui&s;hed by large wens; as are even their dogs, and other ani|mals. There &s;eems to be a great contra&s;t in character between the two provinces of Savoy and Piedmont; it being a common ob&s;ervation, that among ten Pied|monte&s;e, there may po&s;&s;ibly be one hone&s;t man; but that one knave is hardly to be found among ten Sa|voyards. This, however, is certain, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> that the Piedmonte&s;e, in general, are very acute and cun|ning; and it were to be wi&s;hed they always made a good u&s;e of their talents; but their &s;chemes are gene|rally &s;o well laid, and attended with &s;o much contri|vance and invention, that one cannot but admire their <HI>fine&s;&s;e.</HI> In the year 1695 a Piedmonte&s;e, who &s;tiled him&s;elf Count <HI>Curaffa,</HI> came to Vienna, and privately waited on the prime mini&s;ter, pretending he was &s;ent by the Duke of Savoy, on a very important affair, which they two were to negociate, without the privity of the French court. At the &s;ame time he produced his credentials, in which the Duke's &s;eal and &s;ignature were exactly imitated. He met with a favourable re|ception; and, without affecting any privacy, took upon
<PB N="41" REF="43">
him the title of Envoy Extraordinary from the court of Savoy. At a private concert, the captain of the guard denying him admittance, he had the a&s;&s;urance to demand &s;atisfaction, in his ma&s;ter's name, and the captain was obliged to a&s;k his pardon. His fir&s;t care was to ingratiate him&s;elf with the Je&s;uits, who bore great &s;way at court; and, to this end, he went to vi&s;it their church; which, at that time remaining un|fini&s;hed, as they pretended, from the low &s;tate of their finances; he a&s;ked them how much money would complete it. An e&s;timate to the amount of 2000 louis|d'ors being laid before him, <HI>Caraffa</HI> a&s;&s;ured them of his con&s;tant attachment to their order; and that they might immediately proceed in building their church. In con&s;equence of his promi&s;e he &s;ent that very day 2000 louis-d'ors, at which &s;um the charge had been computed. He was &s;en&s;ible that this was a part he could not act long, without being detected; and, that this genero&s;ity might not be at his own at his own ex|pence, he invited a great number of ladies of rank to a &s;upper and ball. Every one of his gue&s;ts promi&s;ed to be there; but he complained to them of the ill re|turns made to his civilities, adding that he had often been di&s;appointed; as the ladies, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, made no &s;cruple of breaking their words; and, in a jocular way, in&s;i&s;ted on a pledge, from every lady, for her appearance on the day appointed. One gave him a ring, another a pearl necklace, a third a pair of ear|rings,
<PB N="42" REF="44">
a fourth a gold watch; and &s;everal &s;uch trinkets, to the amount of between two and three thou&s;and pounds. On the evening appointed not one of the gue&s;ts was mi&s;&s;ing; but it may ea&s;ily be conceived what a damp it &s;truck upon the whole a&s;&s;embly, when it was found that the gay Piedmonte&s;e had di&s;appeared. Nor had the Je&s;uits any great rea&s;on to applaud them|&s;elves for their di&s;&s;imulation; as, a few days before his departure, the pretended count, putting on an air of deep concern, placed him&s;elf in the way of the Emperor's confe&s;&s;or; who, enquiring into the cau&s;e of his apparent melancholy, he entru&s;ted him with the important &s;ecret; that he was &s;hort of money at a junc|ture when 8000 louis-d'ors were immediately wanted for his ma&s;ter's affairs, to be di&s;tributed at the Imperial court. The Je&s;uits, to whom he had recently given &s;uch an in&s;tance of his liberality, immediately furni&s;hed him with the &s;um he wanted; and with this viaticum, and the ladies' pledges, he very prudently withdrew. Some years after he was taken up for an exploit very different from the la&s;t, and the Duke gave orders for beheading him; but the &s;entence was mitigated into perpetual impri&s;onment, his council having very elo|quently enlarged upon a maxim of law, <HI>quod excellens in arte non debeat mori;</HI> that is, "He who excels in any art, ought not to be put to death.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="45">Quickne&s;s of parts and penetration is not here con|fined to the great and learned, but even con&s;picuous in people of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s; to which, be&s;ides the warmth and &s;erenity of the country, their frequent in|tercour&s;e with the French, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> may not have a little contributed. In the mountains of Ao&s;ta, where neither of the&s;e circum&s;tances concur, the inha|bitants are an exception to this general character of the Piedmonte&s;e. They &s;eldom travel beyond their hills and vallies; and &s;carce think there is any part of the world inhabited, be&s;ides the &s;pot they live upon, and the wens are the con&s;equence of the mud-water they drink. Such is the power of cu&s;tom, that a wen by them is reckoned no deformity; and a &s;tory goes about, that a foreign woman, who had no wen, coming into one of their churches in &s;ermon time, a general laughter was heard among them, at &s;o uncommon an appearance. It is added, that even the preacher could not contain him&s;elf for &s;ome time; but, recovering his gravity, he repre&s;ented to his auditory, that though they might not mean any harm, the natural defects of our neighbour were not a &s;ubject of laughter; and that a chri&s;tian, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, &s;hould rather be thankful to his Maker for his bounty to him, than in|&s;ult his fellow-creatures, from whom God had with|held his ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46">As to the ladies' behaviour at Turin, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> it mu&s;t be owned extremely free; for they are continually talking to the gentlemen, and laughing &s;o exce&s;&s;ively as, in other places, would expo&s;e them to cen&s;ure. Every one has her gallant, and a confident for carrying on intrigues; and with the&s;e they chiefly conver&s;e in a&s;|&s;emblies; but a foreigner, who is not di&s;po&s;ed to live extravagantly, mu&s;t not expect his acquaintance will be much &s;ought for by the gay part of the fair &s;ex. Vanity, and fondne&s;s for prai&s;e, induce them to make a mighty &s;hew of politene&s;s to &s;trangers; they ri&s;e up to them, at their coming into an a&s;&s;embly, talk with them of the weather, the opera, and &s;uch indifferent matters; but this is their <HI>ne plus ultra.</HI> Their beha|viour of the fir&s;t week continues the &s;ame for two or three months; but the&s;e civilities decline much &s;ooner, if they imagine a &s;tranger means to make a longer &s;tay at the court, or in the city.</P>
<P>Piedmont, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> who was a native of this province, never produced a &s;ingle poet; they are even, &s;ays he, in&s;en&s;ible to the beauties of an <HI>Orlando</HI> and a <HI>Goffredo;</HI> which will in&s;tantly warm a Roman, a Tu&s;can, a Venetian, and a Neapolitan. It is likewi&s;e ob&s;ervable, that no Piedmonte&s;e ever attained to any degree of excellence in the polite arts; but though they are not to be compared with the re&s;t of the Ita|lians, for brilliancy of imagination and ju&s;tne&s;s of ta&s;te,
<PB N="45" REF="47">
yet, as warriors, none can equal them. Every one con|ver&s;ant in hi&s;tory knows the brave &s;tand made by them, for centuries, whenever their territories have been in|vaded by France, by Spain, or by Germany. It is true they have frequently been overpowered by num|bers; but they have in&s;tantaneo&s;ly recovered from their defeat, and given &s;ufficient cau&s;e of repentance to the nation that has endeavoured, in vain, to &s;ubdue them. Such is the martial &s;pirit of Piedmont, that even the gro&s;&s;e&s;t pea&s;ants are ambitious of appearing in a military character. Their &s;kill in fortifications is great, and cannot be exceed by the Vaubans and the Cohorns. Tho&s;e places, which inferior engineers would have made only &s;trong, they have made im|pregnable.</P>
<P>The Turine&s;e nobles are proud of their de&s;cent; and di&s;dain all intercour&s;e with tho&s;e of their fellow-&s;ubjects, whom they think a degree below them&s;elves; or, when admitted to &s;ome familiarity, their conde&s;cen|&s;ion is &s;uch a compound of urbanity and haughtine&s;s, that proves di&s;gu&s;tful to men of &s;pirit. Many of them have obtained the reputation of &s;kilful politicians; but their aver&s;ion to all &s;cientific acqui&s;itions is &s;o great, that few of them have their own language; (I do not mean their <HI>patois</HI>) fewer &s;till the Latin, and perhaps there is not even one, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> who can read the alphabet in Greek.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">Nor are the fir&s;t and &s;econd rank of women more informed. A few French romances form their libra|ries; nor is it in Piedmont one mu&s;t expect rational entertainment in the conver&s;ation of the fair. Some few of them plunge into gro&s;s immorality; but, for the mo&s;t part, even when young and hand&s;ome, they give into incorrigible bigotry.</P>
<P>The arti&s;ans and pea&s;antry excel all the re&s;t of Italy. No nation can cope with them for their indu&s;try and &s;kill in their manufactures and their hu&s;bandry. Such are the leading traits of their character, as delineated by <HI>Bareiti,</HI> who was him&s;elf a native of the capital.</P>
<P>We may add, what &s;eems agreed by all writers, that though the government of Piedmont is arbitrary, the pea&s;ants are rich and happy. They pay no <HI>diximies, vingtiemes,</HI> nor <HI>taille,</HI> as in France. They can afford to live comfortably; have cattle in abundance, as well as implements of hu&s;bandry to carry on their agricul|culture; and are, on Sundays, or <HI>jours de &s;&ecirc;te,</HI> well dre&s;&s;ed in clothes made of &s;ilk. The univer&s;al orna|ment of their women is a necklace, of five or &s;ix rows of gold beads, pretty large, with a cro&s;s and ear-rings of the &s;ame metal; which generally co&s;t them from three to &s;ix hundred livres, of Piedmont, and &s;ome|times more. Every married <HI>pay&s;anne</HI> is decorated with
<PB N="47" REF="49">
the&s;e ornaments, more or le&s;s expen&s;ive, according to their means.</P>
<P>Duels are not very frequent; but, when they hap|pen, they fight with ferocity, and an ob&s;tinacy that &s;hocks humanity. The general place of appointment is a little ifland, formed by the Po, ju&s;t within what is called the <HI>Port da Po.</HI></P>
<P>The theatre is under great re&s;trictions from the police. Before an opera is to be performed, the King him&s;elf takes the pains to read it over; and to era&s;e every line that can admit of an indecent, or double meaning. This attention is particularly paid to the theatre on account of the morals of the royal family. The King is &s;o rigidly virtuous, that he never goes to the comic opera, nor permits any of his own family to attend it. Al&s;o in regard to the dances, as the Ita|lian ta&s;te is more inclined to the grote&s;que, than the &s;erious, the <HI>dan&s;eu&s;es</HI> jump very high, and kick up their heels in a more &s;urprizing, than graceful man|ner; but, if their attitudes happen to be unguarded, they have a &s;harp rebuke from the police. The de|licate <HI>Zamperini,</HI> after her return from England, ex|pre&s;&s;ed too much licentiou&s;ne&s;s in her action and manner; for which &s;he had an immediate order, from the Duche&s;s of Savoy, to quit at once tho&s;e airs, which <HI>La Signiora</HI> in&s;tantly obeyed. The black
<PB N="48" REF="50">
drawers, worn by the <HI>dan&s;eu&s;es,</HI> have a very di&s;gu&s;ting appearance.</P>
<P>The police is &s;o &s;trict here as to prevent any riots in the &s;treets; for if three or four per&s;ons only are &s;een, conver&s;ing together with animation, the <HI>Guet,</HI> or guard, comes up; and, if any thing my&s;terious ap|pears in their manner, or that they cannot give a good account of them&s;elves, they are impri&s;oned. The wine-hou&s;es are never free from emi&s;&s;aries of the po|lice. Thus plotting of every kind is, in a great mea|&s;ure, prevented, by their vigilance, whether again&s;t government, or individuals. No di&s;orderly women are permitted to walk the &s;treets. The <HI>Laquais de place</HI> are generally here, as they were in Paris, in the pay of the police; and inform them of all they can di&s;|cover, in regard to the &s;trangers, whom they &s;erve.

However, he treads in the &s;teps of his prede|ce&s;&s;or, in one re&s;pect, very clo&s;ely.

The face, neck, and &s;houlders of the&s;e godde&s;&s;es were perfectly beautiful; and, we may &s;uppo&s;e, the re&s;t of their per&s;ons were as full of merit, being the produc|tion of &s;o great a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="57">The univer&s;ity, be&s;ides its &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s, is one of the fine&s;t buildings in the city; particularly its front, towards <HI>Rue de l'academie,</HI> which is very large, lofty, and magnificent. The profe&s;&s;ors, of which there are a con&s;iderable number, are called <HI>&s;apienti&s;&s;imi patres.</HI> All the learned profe&s;&s;ions, throughout the whole country, require a previous examination, by the uni|ver&s;ity, with proper recommendations. No noi&s;y trade is allowed near it. The apartment, appropri|ated for the library, contains a valuable collection of books, with a mu&s;eum of antiques. Among&s;t the re|markable curio&s;ities in this mu&s;eum, is a little vellum book, much prized by the <HI>dilettanti;</HI> it containing a de&s;ign of the famous <HI>Julio Romano</HI> in every leaf. This mu&s;eum and the library are open for &s;everal hours every day, both morning and evening; not only for the &s;tudents of the univer&s;ity, but for &s;trangers to have free acce&s;s to. The number of &s;tudents, at pre&s;ent, is computed to be above three thou&s;and.

This epocha for learning, among them, was only from the la&s;t years of the reign of King <HI>Victor.</HI> This prince deprived the Je&s;uits of the direction of the public &s;tudies, and their place has been &s;upplied by the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58">It is not difficult for a &s;tranger to get admittance into the fir&s;t circles of Turin, provided he is di&s;po&s;ed to play; but if he plays, he mu&s;t be very much on his guard; for though he may have to do with per&s;ons of the &s;tricte&s;t honour, and no foul play in the lea&s;t to be apprehended; yet, if he is not a very expert game&s;ter indeed, he is certain to come off a lo&s;er. The Pied|monte&s;e play at dice, as it were, from their infancy; and thus attain to &s;uch perfection in this art, that very &s;ew are a match for them.

<P>Of the inconveniences to be met with in Turin, the mo&s;t obvious are the thick fogs; which, in autumn and winter, are continually ri&s;ing from the Po, and other rivers; by which the air is rendered thick and moi&s;t, and, con&s;equently unhealthy. The&s;e exhalations very much incommode the city, which is often in|volved in fogs and rain; while Rivoli enjoys a &s;erene &s;ky, and bright &s;un&s;hine.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59">Another inconvenience, almo&s;t as bad, ari&s;es from the foul muddy water in mo&s;t of the wells in this city; chiefly owing to an unpardonable negligence, in not keeping them &s;weet and clean; dead dogs and cats, and other filth, being often thrown into them.</P>
<P>The inns al&s;o &s;tand in great need of better regula|tion, that travellers may be well u&s;ed, and not &s;o into|lerably impo&s;ed upon. There is not a place, in all Italy, where the entertainment is &s;o bad, at the &s;ame expence.</P>
<P>The manner of burying their dead is al&s;o very di&s;|agreeable. The corp&s;e is carried in proce&s;&s;ion to the ground, with the face uncovered, where it is put into the grave, without any coffin. This is not only a &s;hocking &s;pectacle, at all times, but, when the decea&s;ed happens to die of the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, or any contagious di&s;temper, it may cau&s;e a very unhappy impre&s;&s;ion on pregnant women, and other per&s;ons, who are liable to catch the infection. The ma&s;ked fraternities, who oftend attend at funerals, of whom nothing but the eyes are to be &s;een, make indeed a dreadful, but a very &s;habby proce&s;&s;ion. It is al&s;o very di&s;agreeable that, even when there is any contagious di&s;temper in the city, three or four corp&s;es &s;hall lie a whole day, in the churches, uncovered. Per&s;ons of rank have family vaults, in the churches and chapels; but the lower
<PB N="58" REF="60">
&s;ort are thrown into a vault, belonging to their pari&s;h church, fifty, or an hundred and fifty together; and without any coffins. The&s;e receptacles, indeed, are very deep, and have &s;everal doors, the pa&s;&s;age leading to them being vaulted; but this cannot prevent the cadaverous &s;mell, and noxious effluvia, from pene|trating into the churches. This impropriety is not peculiar to Turin, but common to mo&s;t large cities, e&s;pecially in Popi&s;h countries; yet it is a practice contrary to rea&s;on, and ought entirely to be laid a&s;ide in every country. In this particular, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> I am mightily plea&s;ed with Dr. <HI>Verbeyen,</HI> profe&s;&s;or of phy&s;ic and anatomy, at Louvain; who compo&s;ed the following epitaph, for him&s;elf, in Latin. <HI>"Philip Verbeyen,</HI> Doctor and Profe&s;&s;or of Phy&s;ic, ordered his remains to be buried in the church-yard here, that he might not pollute the church, and infect it, with noxious effluvia.

<P>THE &s;ub&s;tance of the commerce of Piedmont is raw &s;ilk. The Piedmonte&s;e nobility keep large &s;tocks of &s;ilk-worms, which, under certain re&s;trictions, they commit to the care of their tenants; the punctual attendance they require being a work of no &s;mall trouble. The proprietor furni&s;hes the eggs; and, in return, has half the &s;ilk. From the number of white mulberry-trees, in any per&s;on's plantation, it is nearly computed how many worms the owner may breed. The number of worms produced from a &s;ingle ounce of eggs will con&s;ume, from eighty, to one hun|dred and forty rubbs of mulberry leaves; each rubb weighs five-and-twenty pounds. The&s;e leaves, when &s;old, fetch from ten, to five-and-twenty &s;ols per rubb. The eggs &s;ell from three and a half, to five livres an ounce. An ounce of eggs will &s;ometimes yield four rubbs of cods, with the &s;ilk on; every pound of which is worth from twenty, to five-and-twenty &s;ols: the&s;e
<PB N="60" REF="62">
being thrown into warm water, the threads are ea&s;ily detached, and wound off to the very la&s;t. A pound of fine &s;ilk, thus wound, fetches a louis-d'or.</P>
<P>Grazing likewi&s;e turns to &s;uch good account, that the profits on this article are computed at three mil|lions of livres; a con&s;iderable part of which ari&s;es from the &s;ale of bullocks, to the Milane&s;e. There are &s;ome &s;alt-&s;prings in Savoy; of which the King has the entire profit; he di&s;po&s;es of the whole profit to the Switzers.</P>
<P>Many of the manufactures of Turin are carried on for the King's account; as tobacco, &s;alt, lead, &amp;c. All the &s;alt con&s;umed in the kingdom comes from Sar|dinia; every head of a family is obliged to take eight pounds yearly, for each individual of his family, who has pa&s;&s;ed the &s;eventeenth year; for each cow or ox two, for every hog four, at four &s;ols per pound; if he happens to want more he has it half that price. The farmers here give their cattle &s;alt, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, which certainly &s;ucceeds extremely well; it being im|po&s;&s;ible too &s;ee finer cattle, of every kind, than in this country. The oxen and cows are nearly quite white; they are &s;haded with grey and brown, in a mo&s;t beau|tiful manner, and have remarkably pretty faces, with pencilled eyebrows. There is &s;carce a table at Turin where a &s;oup made of veal, &s;erved with the <HI>bouillie,</HI> is
<PB N="61" REF="63">
not a &s;tanding di&s;h; and frequently veal, repeated again, at the &s;ame repa&s;t, under &s;ome other form; for it is a piece of policy here to cry down the beef as unwhole|&s;ome, though as fine as any in Leadenhall market, in order to per&s;uade the people to con&s;ume the veal; the full-grown oxen being driven to Genoa, where they yield a better price than in the Genoa market.</P>
<P>The chief trade of this city and country, &s;ays <HI>Mar|tyn,</HI> is in thrown &s;ilk, which is &s;ent to England and Lyons; they manufacture, however, &s;ome of it into excellent &s;tockings, and good &s;ilk for furniture. They are likewi&s;e famous for ro&s;oli, millefleurs, &s;nuff, cha|mois, gloves, and &s;ome other trifles. They import broad-cloth and linen from Great Britain; &s;ome woollen and Lyon goods from France; linens from Switzerland and Sile&s;ia: al&s;o iron, copper, &s;ugar, and drugs of all &s;orts. Their chief export is cattle, &s;ome hemp and cordage; they reckon that upwards of ninety thou&s;and bullocks are annually &s;ent out of Piedmont. A great deal of wine is made at Pied|mont, but it is not good; the principal attention of government has been be&s;towed on the cultivation of mulberry trees. Rice al&s;o is a great object of culture in &s;ome provinces.</P>
<P>The affairs relating to the finances, in all courts, are kept &s;ecret; and, nece&s;&s;arily, much more &s;o here.
<PB N="62" REF="64">
A certain &s;tate&s;man, however, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> e&s;timates the King's entire yearly revenue at twenty millions of Piedmonte&s;e livres; of which the duties on &s;ilk pro|duce five, and tho&s;e on hemp and rice, three millions. As to the kingdom of Sardinia, it is evident, that the charges of the troops and civil officers being de|ducted, the re&s;idue of the annual income from that kingdom, cannot exceed a hundred thou&s;and livres; and that the importance of that country, to the hou&s;e of Savoy, is more on account of its regality, than its revenue.</P>
<P>In the King's territories, on the continent, are &s;ix|teen bi&s;hoprics; among which are the two archbi&s;hops of Turin and the Tarantai&s;e. Be&s;ides the city of Turin, above three hundred and forty towns and vil|lages are &s;ubject to the juri&s;diction of the former; and as, among the Roman Catholics, every one is obliged to communicate at Ea&s;ter, and deliver to the prie&s;t an account of his children and family, the whole number of the inhabitants, of &s;uch a country, may be pretty accurately known; and I have been a&s;&s;ured, &s;ay; <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> from &s;uch computations, the King's &s;ubjects in Piedmont and Savoy, and other parts on the con|tinent, amount to two millions, and &s;ome thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>The duty on &s;nuff is farmed for four hundred thou|&s;and livres; and travellers &s;hould be careful to have
<PB N="63" REF="65">
no foreign tobacco among their baggage. At fir&s;t it was farmed only for twelve thou&s;and; afterwards the &s;ame per&s;on, being a Jew, paid more than treble that &s;um for it; and when a friend di&s;&s;uaded him, ob&s;erving it would probably ruin him, he replied, "The u&s;e of &s;nuff is a pernicious cu&s;tom, and con&s;equently will daily increa&s;e; &s;o that there is no danger to be appre|hended from rai&s;ing the farm, it being the nature of mankind to be extremely addicted to what is hurtful." The King's revenues, &s;ays <HI>Martyn,</HI> are e&s;timated at little more than a million &s;terling; with this his hou&s;e|hold is well &s;upported and paid, his troops well cloathed, and always complete.</P>
<P>The King's prerogative, in civil affairs, is equal to that of any monarch in Europe; and, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, few kings, of the Roman Catholic religion, carry it with &s;o high a hand as his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and his late ance&s;tors have done. Care indeed has been taken to treat the Pope with all po&s;&s;ible com|plai&s;ance; but the King has obtained from him the di&s;po&s;al of mo&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices in Savoy and Piedmont; as al&s;o the nomination to a cardinal's hat.</P>

<P>THE &s;ituation of the King of Sardinia's domi|nions, on the continent, oblige him to be on his guard, in ca&s;e of any broils between the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and Bourbon; but his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and his ance&s;tors, have found means to reap &s;ome advant|age from all the wars that have happened for above a century pa&s;t. A war in Italy being very expen&s;ive, both to the French and Germans, the hou&s;e of Savoy has &s;hewn it knows how to value its friend&s;hip accord|ingly. The duchy of Savoy lies expo&s;ed to the French, and can be taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by them with little, or no re&s;i&s;tance. The King of Sardinia cannot think of being a gainer by declaring war again&s;t France; the great power of that monarchy, and the mountainous nature of the country, being a bar again&s;t his Sardinian Maje&s;ty's extending his dominions on that &s;ide; be|&s;ides, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France, he may face all his enemies. On the other hand, it is not ea&s;y to di&s;lodge
<PB N="65" REF="67">
the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria from any of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions by force; therefore the more advi&s;eable way has always been to procure &s;ome little advantages by leagues and &s;tipulations. This method has an&s;wered &s;o well as, by degrees, to transfer almo&s;t the whole country of Mount|&s;erat, and &s;ome other neighbouring territories, into the hands of the hou&s;e of Savoy.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's regular forces con&s;i&s;t of about twenty two thou&s;and men, exclu&s;ive of the hor&s;e-guards and artillery; and fifteen well di&s;ciplined regiments of militia. The&s;e la&s;t have only their cloathing, and a &s;ol per day; they are continually at their own ha|bitations, where they &s;ub&s;i&s;t by hu&s;bandry, and other labour; except twice a year, when they are mu&s;tered, and exerci&s;ed for a few weeks; but, on the&s;e occa|&s;ions, they receive the &s;ame pay as the regulars. He has &s;our regiments of foreigners, mo&s;tly Germans, which make a body of five thou&s;and men; and not only &s;erve to give a greater weight to his authority in his own country; but al&s;o that the Piedmonte&s;e, and Savoyard &s;oldiers, having before their eyes a pattern of complete di&s;cipline, may be &s;tirred up to emulate them. There is likewi&s;e this additional advantage, that &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the forces con&s;i&s;ting of foreigners, more hands may be &s;pared for tillage. The great advantage of peopling a country in peaceable times, with pea&s;ants rather than &s;oldiers, was not un|known

to George I. who i&s;&s;ued an order in his Ger|man dominions, that every &s;oldier there, who would undertake the management of a farm, or turn pea&s;ant, &s;hould have his di&s;charge for ten dollars. The King of Sardinia has al&s;o lately renewed a law of the re|gent duche&s;s <HI>Chri&s;tina,</HI> calculated for increa&s;ing the human &s;pecies. By this law it was enacted, that all parents having twelve children, lawfully begotten, &s;hould be exempted, during life, from all taxes. In the number of the twelve children are included, not only tho&s;e of the fir&s;t generation, but likewi&s;e the grand|children, who&s;e fathers happen to die before their grandfather; as al&s;o tho&s;e who are killed in the king's &s;ervice. Each of the&s;e foreign regiments con&s;i&s;ts of twelve hundred men; and, by virtue of their particu|lar capitulations, &s;uch a regiment brings the colonel in between ten, and twelve thou&s;and dollars a year. In the year 1710, a great number of prote&s;tant re|cruits for one of the&s;e German regiments coming into Piedmont; &s;everal of the common &s;oldiers u&s;ed to make a practice, upon entering into any new gar|ri&s;on where they were not known, of publicly pro|fe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves Roman Catholics. The motives were not owing to con&s;cience or devotion; but to the &s;um of five livres, which was paid to every one who came over to the Romi&s;h church; be&s;ides what they got from mona&s;teries, and people of &s;ub&s;tance. Among the&s;e recruits was an hone&s;t Swabian, of &s;uch an open
<PB N="67" REF="69">
frankne&s;s and &s;implicity, that he went about all Turin, a&s;king, in his own country dialect, where that mona&s;|tery was, that gave five livres to any one turning Catholic.</P>
<P>It contributes not a little to the maintenance of mi|litary di&s;cipline and order, that the regiments conti|nually do duty at Turin, as the King's foot-guards. The pre&s;ence, and attention of his Maje&s;ty, cau&s;es &s;uch care and punctuality to be ob&s;erved among the troops, as would probably be neglected in any other quarter. The guard is daily relieved by an hundred and twenty men, and con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-four grena|diers, thirty troopers, and about one hundred and thirty mu&s;queteers.</P>
<P>The pay of the troop of hor&s;e-guards is about twen|ty-&s;ix thou&s;and livres a year. The private men, who are mo&s;tly noblemen, have each five-and-twenty livres a month. Their uniform is provided by the King. As the king travels very expeditiou&s;ly, they are often hard put to it. It is a long hour's journey, from Tu|rin to La Veniere, on a round trot; and, to go to Rivoli, it takes up three hours; yet the king runs the former in a quarter, and the latter in three-quarters of an hour. If a hor&s;e dies, the officer to whom the hor&s;e belonged mu&s;t provide another.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70">In the other regiments the appointments are &s;till more &s;lender. Officers, quartered at Turin, have in|deed an opportunity of boarding them&s;elves on very rea&s;onable terms. The king has an exact account of all his officers, ob&s;erves every one's good and bad qualities, and, from time to time, makes very particu|lar enquiries, not only of one, but of &s;everal per&s;ons, concerning the behaviour of every one of them. From the&s;e informations he prefers them, without any re|gard to rank or &s;eniority. It is al&s;o the King's plea|&s;ure that all offices, in his maje&s;ty's immediate di&s;po&s;al, be accounted equally honourable. A mini&s;ter of &s;tate once petitioning the King to make his &s;on a lieutenant, or an en&s;ign, <HI>comme un petit employ, i. e.</HI> as an incon|&s;iderable po&s;t; the King an&s;wered, <HI>Je nay point de pe|tits employs &agrave; donner;</HI> I have no incon&s;iderable po&s;t to give away. It is owing to this that the &s;ons of many, of the noble&s;t and wealthie&s;t families, are en|&s;igns and lieutenants. Be&s;ides, no per&s;on can obtain a place at court, without having &s;erved in the army.</P>
<P>The tran&s;actions of the la&s;t wars have &s;erved to in|&s;pire the Piedmonte&s;e with a martial &s;pirit; and &s;uch actions were performed by their troops, as would have done honour to the ancient Romans. Towards the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war, when mar&s;hal <HI>Catinat</HI> invaded Piedmont, it was of the highe&s;t importance to the Duke of Savoy, to march in time for putting Turin in a
<PB N="69" REF="71">
better po&s;ture of defence. To this end he di&s;patched the Count <HI>de Santena,</HI> then a major, and afterwards a general, with a few hundred men, to an old ca&s;tle, about three German miles from Turin, which com|mands the road and valley from Su&s;a. As the French army was pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Santena,</HI> he fired at them, with what little artillery he had. <HI>Catinat,</HI> who was no le&s;s &s;urprized than provoked, at this in&s;ult, &s;ent to the ca&s;tle, threatening to hang up the commanding officer; who returned him for an&s;wer, that he &s;hould never have him alive; and that, till the artillery &s;hould be brought before the ca&s;tle, no &s;urrender was to be expected. <HI>Catinat</HI> now &s;till more incen&s;ed, ordered a battery to be erected, and the ca&s;tle &s;ummoned a &s;econd time. <HI>Santena</HI> an&s;wered that a breach mu&s;t fir&s;t be made; which being begun, he offered to ca|pitulate. <HI>Catinat</HI> &s;ent a lieutenant into the ca&s;tle to &s;ettle the articles of capitulation; but, as a prelimi|nary condition, demanded that the &s;oldiers &s;hould be made pri&s;oners of war, and the officers hanged. Upon this <HI>Santena</HI> took the lieutenant into his chamber, &s;hut the door, and conducted him between two barrels of powder, with two lighted matches lying by. <HI>Santena,</HI> taking one of the lighted matches, got upon one of the powder barrels, and de&s;ired the lieutenant to fol|low his example; adding, that &s;ince he mu&s;t die, many more of the French &s;hould take a &s;pring into the air, before all the Piedmonte&s;e in the ca&s;tle &s;hould
<PB N="70" REF="72">
lo&s;e their lives. The lieutenant &s;o little reli&s;hed this compliment, that he begged <HI>Santena</HI> to lay a&s;ide this de&s;perate de&s;ign, promi&s;ing to do all that lay in his power for obtaining an honourable capitulation. Upon this a&s;&s;urance the commandant di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the lieutenant; who having made his report to <HI>Catinat,</HI> the mar&s;hal &s;aid, I mu&s;t &s;ee this man of &s;uch extraordi|nary &s;pirit and re&s;olution; and allowed that he and his men &s;hould march out with their &s;words. As <HI>San|tena</HI> pa&s;&s;ed by him, the mar&s;hal &s;aid, that he did in|deed de&s;erve well to be hanged; but, to &s;hew him he could e&s;teem courage and bravery in an enemy, he &s;hould dine with him that day. At table &s;ome of the officers upbraided <HI>Santena,</HI> on account of the Duke of Savoy's forming a league, with heretics, again&s;t the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King. <HI>Santena</HI> remained &s;ilent for &s;ome time; till, at la&s;t, he a&s;ked the mar&s;hal if he would allow him freedom of &s;peech; <HI>Catinat</HI> con&s;ent|ing, he replied, "That his ma&s;ter had indeed, for &s;elf-defence, taken arms again&s;t the King of France, and had entered into an alliance with heretics, &s;uch as the Engli&s;h and Dutch; nay, further, that his ma&s;ter was for doing &s;omething wor&s;e, and had &s;ent to Con&s;tan|tinople to negociate a league with the Turks; but that his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty had been before hand with him." <HI>Catenat</HI> laughed at the officers, who had forced this keen repartee from <HI>Santena,</HI> &s;aying this might teach them never to in&s;ult brave men under misfor|tunes.
<PB N="71" REF="73">
However, <HI>Santena</HI> had the good fortune to ob|tain, for his ma&s;ter, a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms for &s;ome days.</P>
<P>The Piedmonte&s;e have likewi&s;e &s;ignalized them|&s;elves for their valour in foreign &s;ervice; of which, among others, the late general <HI>St. Amour</HI> is an in|&s;tance. When he was made colonel of a regiment, the officers, who valued them&s;elves upon their birth, were &s;o extremely piqued again&s;t him, he being but a pea|&s;ant's &s;on, that he was challenged by four of his cap|tains &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, whom he killed upon the &s;pot; and, upon di&s;patching the la&s;t, &s;aid, "There are now but eight left;" but the others thought fit to let the affair drop. It was not his valour only which entitled that gentleman to the highe&s;t e&s;teem; but al&s;o his prudence and di&s;cretion, in never forgetting the meanne&s;s of his extraction. Once, while he was at table in Piedmont, with the chief officers and generals, whom he had in|vited to an entertainment, his father happened to come into the hou&s;e, and &s;ent up word of his arrival. <HI>St. Amour</HI> informed his gue&s;ts of it, adding, that he was not in&s;en&s;ible of the regard due to them, but begged leave that he might dine with his father in the next room. He accordingly withdrew, though the com|pany was very urgent with him, that his father might &s;it down at their table; and thus acted up to the cha|racter of the dutiful &s;on, and the polite gentleman.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74">Among the fortifications of mo&s;t note, in this coun|try, is Fort Brunette; which &s;tands on the road be|tween Su&s;a and Novale&s;e, and, perhaps, has not its equal in the whole world. It con&s;i&s;ts of eight ba&s;|tions; and, together with all its out-works, was hewn out of a rock. The ba&s;tions, and other works, have a communication by &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, under rocks; which are &s;o large that carriages, and heavy cannon, with &s;everal hor&s;es, may very conveniently go from one place to another.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Laws.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG &s;ome excellent laws and ordinances made by the late king of Sardinia, is his care for the &s;ecurity of the roads; by the&s;e means one may now travel in Italy, with as much &s;afety as in any other country. Banditti are tho&s;e malefactors who have been bani&s;hed or have incurred &s;ome other pe|nalty, but have not yet fallen into the hands of ju&s;tice, or el&s;e e&s;caped from it: as the&s;e per&s;ons often lurk about on the frontiers, where they &s;upport them|&s;elves by rapine and violence; they who infe&s;t the roads, or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins who hire them&s;elves out to com|mit murder, likewi&s;e, go under the name of ban|ditti. Italy was formerly over-run by the&s;e vermin; but the Duke de <HI>Ca&s;pi,</HI> viceroy of Naples, demon|&s;trating that they were ea&s;ily to be reduced by re&s;o|lution and &s;everity; all the other &s;tates, and parti|cularly the hou&s;e of Savoy, determined to pur&s;ue the plan.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">In order to create a mutual di&s;tru&s;t and divi&s;ion among the banditti, any one of the&s;e mi&s;creants delivering up another to the magi&s;trates, convicted of a like crime with him&s;elf, or of a greater, re|ceived a full and free pardon. Of &s;uch banditti as were guilty of very extraordinary and flagrant crimes, an exact li&s;t was every year put up in all the public places, &s;ignifying, that any one might kill them with impunity. Whoever delivered &s;uch a one alive was entituled to an exemption from puni&s;hment, whatever &s;entence had been pa&s;&s;ed upon him; or, if that was not his ca&s;e, he might transfer the benefit, and obtain pardon for another, except in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on. If the banditti was delivered up dead, the privilege of pardon extended to the per|&s;on that delivered up the criminal, and to his neare&s;t relations. Any one bringing a banditti to ju&s;tice, who either will not or cannot take the benefit of the pardon, receives in lieu thereof a certain &s;um of money, out of the king's trea&s;ury. At fir&s;t the ex|tirpation of the banditti was a difficult work, the principal nobility making u&s;e of the&s;e bravoes as a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins for their private revenge, and affording them all po&s;&s;ible protection. Two noblemen in particular &s;heltered two banditti, who had between them a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated 48 per&s;ons, and even one of them was &s;o abandoned, that afterwards he murdered a father and his two &s;ons. At that very time Alexan|dria,
<PB N="75" REF="77">
with the adjacent country, being ceded to the king of Sardinia, the third &s;on of that unhappy fa|ther, laid his ca&s;e before his new &s;overeign. The king, who was determined to make an example where it was &s;o highly nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ent for the two noblemen to court, under &s;ome alluring pretences, and upon their arrival ordered them to be taken into cu&s;tody. It was then &s;ignified to them, that if they did not produce tho&s;e villains, or give intelli|gence how they might be &s;ecured, their heads &s;hould an&s;wer for it. This menace forced them to com|ply, and one of the&s;e murderers being &s;urprized, was put to the torture, and executed in the town where he was born. The neighbourhood, and the town it&s;elf, &s;warmed with &s;ecret banditti, &s;o that the king was obliged to &s;end two regiments to at|tend the execution; and in the morning proclama|tion was made, that if any of the inhabitants &s;hould be found out of their re&s;pective dwellings before the execution was over, they &s;hould be immediately hanged up. The other made his e&s;cape to Genoa, and being a very enterpri&s;ing fellow was not ea&s;ily to be caught; but, as no farther mi&s;chief could be ap|prehended from him, he obtained his pardon under certain re&s;trictions and limitations, and now lives, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> quietly at Alexandria.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">There is another commendable regulation, that from the inferior judge, an appeal lies to the pre&s;i|dent of the province, and from him, within ten days after notice of the &s;entence, to the &s;enate at Turin. No magi&s;trates or judges are to take any pre&s;ents except provi&s;ions, and of them only a &s;ufficient quantity for three days. Every malefactor that is taken up, is to be examined within 24 hours after he is in cu&s;tody, under the penalty of ten <HI>ec&ucirc;s d&oacute;r,</HI> payable by the judge. The an&s;wer, and the <HI>protocal,</HI> after being di&s;tinctly and audibly read over to the plaintiff, mu&s;t be &s;igned by him; or if he cannot write, he is to &s;et his mark to it before witne&s;&s;es. Any one knowingly altering bad money, although not at all concerned with the coiners of it, is con|demned for ten years to the gallies. A per&s;on guilty of theft for the fir&s;t offence, if it be no bur|glary, nor exceeding in value two golden crowns, is condemned to draw in a cart like a hor&s;e; but if it exceed that &s;um, he is puni&s;hed with a public whip|ping. For the &s;econd fault, whatever the &s;um be, the delinquent is branded in the arm, and con|demned for five years at lea&s;t to the gallies, and &s;ometimes longer, according to the circum&s;tances of the fact. A third fault condemns a man to the gal|lies for life; but a thief is not puni&s;hed with death, till he be found guilty a fourth time. A hou&s;e-breaker for the fir&s;t fact, if it be under 25 gold
<PB N="77" REF="79">
crowns, is condemned to the gallies during life, and upon a repetition of the &s;ame offence is puni&s;hed with death; a &s;ervant &s;tealing, to the value of 25 gold crowns, is put to death for the fir&s;t offence. A notary making a fal&s;e in&s;trument, or forging a title to an e&s;tate forfeits his life. No per&s;on is to carry fire-arms of any &s;ort, not even upon a journey, un|der the penalty of lo&s;ing them and a fine of 50 gold crowns, which if they cannot pay, they are con|demned for two years to the gallies. This order does not extend to the officers of the king's hou&s;e|hold, nor to foreign travellers; yet the&s;e, if they are not noblemen or gentlemen, mu&s;t part with them during their &s;tay in any town. Some arms are ab&s;o|lutely prohibited, &s;uch as &s;hort pocket-pi&s;tols, poig|nards, Genoe&s;e two-edged pointed knives, daggers, concealed in canes, &amp;c. Any per&s;on having the&s;e arms only in his hou&s;e, is condemned to the gallies for five years, and he on whom they are found, for double that term. By this wi&s;e regulation the &s;afety of travellers is provided for, and tumults and other di&s;orders generally prevented.</P>
<P>The laws here are particularly &s;evere again&s;t the Jews, death being the puni&s;hment for the lea&s;t con|tumelious language again&s;t the Virgin Mary, or any of the &s;aints; as al&s;o for expre&s;&s;ing any contempt of their images. Both &s;exes among them entering their
<PB N="78" REF="80">
15th year, are to wear on their right brea&s;t, by way of an ignominious di&s;tinction, a yellow badge of nine inches long, made of &s;ilk or wool. In the pa&s;|&s;ion-week from Wedne&s;day to Saturday, the Jews mu&s;t not ring a bell nor &s;tir out of their hou&s;es; their doors and windows al&s;o are to be kept &s;hut under penalty of three days impri&s;onment, and &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting on bread and water during that time; but if any Jew &s;ings or plays on a mu&s;ical in&s;trument on tho&s;e days in the pa&s;&s;ion-week, they are to be pub|licly whipped.</P>
<P>The language of the Piedmonte&s;e is a mixture of French and Italian; many of the words are entirely French, but pronounced in the &s;ame manner that they are written, as for example <HI>lait</HI> milk is pro|nounced as it would be in Engli&s;h, &s;o is <HI>fait,</HI> and many other words.</P>

<P>LIES in the Mediterranean, and is divided from the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica by the &s;traits of Bonifacio. From north to &s;outh it is 160 Engli&s;h miles; and from we&s;t to ca&s;t 80. The &s;oil is fertile in oil and wine, and there are a great number of oranges, ci|trons and olives; but it is not properly cultivated, the inhabitants being little inclined to tillage, and preferring to live upon the &s;pontaneous productions of the earth, rather than improve it by hu&s;bandry. They are &s;o far from experiencing any &s;carcity of corn, notwith&s;tanding &s;o much of the country is uncultivated, that &s;ome years, it is &s;aid, they export to the amount of 8 or 900,000 bu&s;hels, which is &s;ent for the mo&s;t part into Spain. They have al&s;o great quantities of cattle as well as game; beeves and &s;heep, in particular, are numerous, as well as hor&s;es, which are very good for labour, and for the road. They are fed in the little i&s;lands about it,
<PB N="80" REF="82">
which are likewi&s;e abounding in game. On the coa&s;t is a fi&s;hery for anchovies and coral, of which they &s;end large quantities to Genoa and Leghorn. They have al&s;o great quantities of that celebrated Epicurean fi&s;h-turtle.</P>
<P>The high mountains on the north &s;ide render the air very unhealthy, by ob&s;tructing the wind from &s;weeping through the whole i&s;land. It is to be at|tributed, perhaps, to this circum&s;tance that the i&s;land is full of mora&s;&s;es. The&s;e mountains contain mines of &s;ilver, lead, &s;ulphur, and alum, and they make a good deal of &s;alt. The inhabitants were formerly &s;o rude and clowni&s;h, that the Romans bani&s;hed their &s;tate-pri&s;oners to this i&s;land. It is divided into two parts; the northern called Cape Logadori, from a cape of that name in the north; and the &s;outhern Cape Cagliari, from the capital city, which &s;tands in this part of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Cagliari is &s;ituated on the declivity of a hill, near the bay, to which it gives name on the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of the i&s;land, and is a large hand&s;ome and po|pulous city, with a tolerable harbour, and very bri&s;k trade. It has al&s;o a univer&s;ity, is the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, and the &s;eat of the viceroy. This city was taken by the Engli&s;h in 1708, who trans|ferred it to the Emperor Charles VI. but it was re|taken
<PB N="81" REF="83">
by the Spaniards in 1717, and about two years after ceded to the duke of Savoy in lieu of Si|cily, and hence he has the title of King of Sar|dinia.</P>
<P>Saffari is another large town on the north-we&s;t part of the i&s;land, &s;ituated in a place about ten miles from the &s;ea. It has a ca&s;tle, and an archbi&s;hop's &s;ee, and contains about 30,000 inhabitants. It is likewi&s;e famous for a fountain called Ro&s;&s;el, which is &s;aid to be much more magnificent than any in Rome. The inhabitants have the following pro|verb, <HI>chi non vide Ro&s;&s;el, non vide mondo,</HI> 'he that has not &s;een Ro&s;&s;el, has not &s;een the world.'</P>
<P>This kingdom is of more importance to the hou&s;e of Savoy as a monarchy, than on account of its re|venues; for the charges of the army and civil officers being deducted, the remainder, does not bring in above 4 or 5000 a year. It is governed by a vice|roy. <HI>Bi&s;ani</HI> mentions, that having ca&s;t anchor in one of the bays of this i&s;land, the inhabitants a&s;&s;embled and fired upon the ve&s;&s;el, and it was with great difficulty he and his companions were permitted to make a landing.

They let their beard grow, &s;ays he, wear a red cap, and are dre&s;&s;ed in a doublet of black felt, covered with a kind of cuira&s;s made of deers &s;kin, which they lace before, and reaches to their knees. Their breeches and boots are of the &s;ame kind, and a girdle goes round their wai&s;te, with a long &s;ti|letto hanging to it. Their manner of living is free and uncontrouled. They follow no occupation, but live upon milk and game. They are continually at variance with each other, and their quarrels gene|rally terminate in a tragic manner. Murderers are &s;ecure by going a few villages off, and uniting them|&s;elves with &s;ome banditti till they can obtain a par|don from the friends of the decea&s;ed. The&s;e people pay &s;o little regard to the king's edicts, that they frequently commence ho&s;tilities again&s;t the military, and ma&s;&s;acre the officers, who in revenge, cut them to pieces where they can get at them, &s;eize upon their cattle, and burn their habitations. In the cities, however, the inhabitants are le&s;s fero|cious; they cultivate the lands and are very civil to &s;trangers.

<P>THE duchy of Montferat bounded to the we&s;t and north by Piedmont; to the ea&s;t by Milan, and to the &s;outh by the republic of Genoa, is a country abounding in every thing, particularly in corn and excellent Mu&s;cadine wine. It contains about 200 cities, towns, and villages. In 1631, 75 places of this duchy were fir&s;t transferred to the duke of Sa|voy, in lieu of a yearly income of 15,000 crowns, payable to him by the duke of Mantua. In 1703 the emperor gave al&s;o to the duke that part of Montferat, which the dukes of Mantua had held as a fief from the emperor, to be held by him pur|&s;uant to the &s;ame tenure. The mo&s;t remarkable
<PB N="84" REF="86">
place in the duchy is Verua, a town once fortified, which &s;tands over the river Po, on a &s;teep rock. It was &s;everal times be&s;ieged and taken, but in 1705 the French, irritated by the long defence it main|tained again&s;t them, blew up its fortifications.</P>

<P><HI>LES valle&eacute;s de Piemont,</HI> the Piedmonte&s;e Vallies, called al&s;o the Vallies Angrogne, and &s;ome|times &s;imply the Vallies, lie we&s;tward, contiguous to the French province of <HI>Dauphin&eacute;.</HI> The valley of Lucerne is 15 miles in length, but of unequal breadth. This valley forms a va&s;t cavity between the highe&s;t mountains, to which there is no acce&s;s but with the greate&s;t difficulty. It can conve|niently hold a great number of men, and here it was, that in the &s;evere&s;t per&s;ecutions of the chri&s;|tian church, the old <HI>Barte</HI> or valley preachers, be|fore the reformation, u&s;ed to preach without ob|&s;truction,

and qualify youth for the &s;acred mini&s;try. In the &s;outhern parts are only che&s;nut plantations and pa&s;tures; but on the hills towards the north, grow wine, corn, herbs, and plants. The fine&s;t corn is produced amid ranges of vine-e&s;paliers.</P>
<P>The valley of St. Martin is about the &s;ame ex|tent. This is the &s;tronge&s;t fortified of any, for be|&s;ides the prodigious mountains, at lea&s;t eight or ten months of the year, covered with &s;now, and con&s;e|quently not to be pa&s;&s;ed, it is acce&s;&s;ible only by a very narrow cavity, called the Tower-bridge, cut through a rock, and no broader than the rapid river, or rather brook, running through it; over which is a lofty bridge, which on being broke down, it is impo&s;&s;ible to enter the valley.</P>
<P>In the&s;e vallies, e&s;pecially that of St. Martin, among the highe&s;t of the mountains and impa&s;&s;able rocks, are large woods and thickets, abounding in white hares, which retain that colour all the year round; be&s;ides foxes, large phea&s;ants, and brown and white partridges. The&s;e thickets are al&s;o re|markable for being the haunts of wolves and bears. On the highe&s;t parts of the Alps, and in open places, when only a little herbage grows, are found the <HI>Marmottes,</HI> a creature &s;omething larger than a rabbet, and in colour of a mixed brown and red.
<PB N="86" REF="88">
The fle&s;h, which is eaten, has much the ta&s;te of pork. The animal has a very &s;hrill cry, and pa&s;&s;es eight or nine months of the year, that is, whil&s;t the&s;e mountains are covered with &s;now, in a pro|found &s;leep. Be&s;ides the chamois, here is al&s;o an animal very like a goat or chamois. Its con&s;tant abode is in the mountains, which, on account of their height, are ever covered with &s;now. It gene|rally &s;leeps on the ice, is much fleeter than the cha|mois, and the fle&s;h, by the inhabitants, is reckoned very &s;trengthening. When any per&s;on is benumbed with cold, or deprived of the u&s;e of a limb by the fro&s;t, &s;ome drops of this creature's blood are admi|ni&s;tered in warm wine or broth; which, upon the patient's being put to bed, throws him into a great &s;weat, after which he recovers. Among the tame bea&s;ts is the <HI>tumar,</HI> engendered either by a bull and a mare, or by a bull and a &s;he-a&s;s: the latter &s;pecies is con&s;iderably &s;maller, and called <HI>Bif;</HI> the former, called <HI>Ba&s;,</HI> has the upper mandible &s;horter than the lower, and both almo&s;t re&s;embling tho&s;e of &s;wine. The head and tail are like tho&s;e of an ox, but the former in&s;tead of horns, has only &s;mall knobs; in all other re&s;pects they are &s;haped either like an hor&s;e or a&s;s. Though not &s;o large as a mule, they are of &s;urpri&s;ing &s;trength, eat little, are very &s;wift-footed, and excellent bea&s;ts for travelling. Some rare plants reputed re&s;toratives, and of very corroborat|ing

qualities, &s;uch as the <HI>Lunaria</HI> are found in the&s;e mountains; they yield al&s;o, a kind of thi&s;tles, not unlike artichoaks, which are eaten, and reck|oned exceeding good again&s;t any contagious di&s;|order.</P>
<P>The&s;e vallies have always belonged to Piedmont. The Walden&s;es, their inhabitants, to whom they have given name, have rendered them&s;elves famous in hi&s;tory, from the per&s;ecutions they underwent on account of their religion. The number of people in the&s;e vallies, &s;carce exceeds 7000. They have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves very much in all the wars, in which their &s;overeign has been engaged during this century; being from their childhood trained up to military exerci&s;es.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Climate, Productions, &amp;c. of Nice.</HEAD>
<P>Nice &s;o much celebrated in this country for the &s;alubrity of its air, extends about 80 miles in length, but in &s;ome places not more than 30 in breadth. It contains &s;everal &s;mall towns and villages, all of which (the capital excepted) are &s;ituated among mountains; the mo&s;t exten&s;ive plain in the whole country being in the neighbourhood of the town of Nice. The length of it does not exceed two miles, nor is the breadth in any part above one. It is bounded by the Mediterranean on the &s;outh. From the &s;ea-&s;hore, the maritime Alps begin with hills of a gentle a&s;cent, ri&s;ing into mountains that form a &s;weep or amphitheatre, ending at Montalban, which overhangs the town of Villa-Franca, divided from Nice by a &s;ingle mountain, on the top of which there is a &s;mall &s;ort, called the Ca&s;tle of Montalban. On the we&s;t &s;ide of this mountain, and in the ea&s;t|ern extremity of the amphitheatre, &s;tands the city
<PB N="89" REF="91">
of Nice, wedged in between a &s;teep rock and the little river Paglion, which de&s;cends from the moun|tains, and wa&s;hing the town-wall on the we&s;t &s;ide, falls into the &s;ea after having filled &s;ome canals for the u&s;e of the inhabitants. The channel of it is very broad, but generally dry in many places; the water (as in the Var, which falls into the &s;ea nearer Antibes) dividing it&s;elf into &s;everal &s;mall &s;treams. The Paglion, being fed by melted &s;now and rains in the mountains, is quite dry in &s;ummer; but it is &s;ometimes &s;welled by &s;udden rains to a very formid|able torrent. This was the ca&s;e in the year 1744, when the French and Spani&s;h armies attacked 18 Piedmonte&s;e battalions, which were po&s;ted on the &s;ide of Montalban. The a&s;&s;ailants were repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of four thou&s;and men, &s;ome hundreds of whom peri&s;hed in repa&s;&s;ing the Paglion, which had &s;welled to a &s;urpri&s;ing degree during the battle, in con&s;equence of a heavy continued rain. This rain was of great &s;ervice to the Piedmonte&s;e, as it prevented one half of the enemy from pa&s;&s;ing the river to &s;u&s;tain the other.</P>
<P>The city of Nice is built in the form of an irre|gular i&s;o&s;celes triangle, the ba&s;e of which fronts the &s;ea. It is altogether indefencible, and therefore without fortifications; in the ea&s;t it is over-hung by a rock, on which we &s;ee the ruins of an old ca&s;tle,
<PB N="90" REF="92">
which, before the invention of artillery, was deemed impregnable. It was taken and di&s;mantled by Ma|re&s;chal <HI>Catinat,</HI> in the time of <HI>Victor Amadaeus,</HI> the father of his Sardinian maje&s;ty. It was afterwards finally demoli&s;hed by the duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> towards the latter end of queen <HI>Ann's</HI> war. To repair this ca&s;tle would be an unnece&s;&s;ary expence, as it is com|manded by Montalban and &s;everal other eminences.</P>
<P>This little town, &s;ituated in the bay of Antibes, is almo&s;t equidi&s;tant from Mar&s;eilles, Turin, and Genoa; the fir&s;t and la&s;t being about 30 leagues from hence by &s;ea, and the capital of Piedmont at the &s;ame di&s;tance to the northward over the moun|tains. It contains, though hardly a mile in circum|ference, 12,000 inhabitants. The &s;treets are nar|row; the hou&s;es are built with &s;tone, and the win|dows, in general, are fitted with paper in&s;tead of gla&s;s. This expedient would not an&s;wer in a coun|try &s;ubject to rain and &s;torms, but here where there is very little of either, the paper lozenges an&s;wer tolerably well. The Bourgeois, however, begin to have their hou&s;es &s;a&s;hed with gla&s;s. From a regi&s;|ter of the weather, kept during a re&s;idence of 18 months in this city, &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> there is le&s;s rain and wind than in any other part of the world that I know; and, &s;uch is the &s;erenity of the air, that nothing is to be &s;een over head for &s;everal months
<PB N="91" REF="93">
together, but a charming blue expan&s;e, without cloud or &s;peck. Whatever clouds may be formed by evaporation from the &s;ea, they &s;eldom or never hover over this &s;mall territory; but, in all probabi|lity, are attracted by the mountains that &s;urround it, and there fall in rain or &s;now; as for tho&s;e that gather from other quarters, I &s;uppo&s;e their progre&s;s hitherward is ob&s;tructed by tho&s;e very Alps which ri&s;e one over another, to an extent of many leagues. This air being dry, pure, heavy, and ela&s;tic, mu&s;t be agreeable to the con&s;titution of tho&s;e who labour under di&s;orders ari&s;ing from weak nerves, ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, relaxed fibres, a vicidity of lymph, and a languid circulation. The air of Nice is &s;o dry, that in &s;ummer, and even in winter (except in wet weather) the evening, and indeed the whole night may be pa&s;&s;ed <HI>&s;ub dio,</HI> without feeling the lea&s;t dew or moi&s;ture; and as for fogs, they are never &s;een in this di&s;trict. In &s;ummer, the air is cooled by a regular &s;ea-breeze blowing from the ea&s;t, like that of the We&s;t Indies. It begins in the forenoon, and increa&s;es with the heat of the day. It dies away about &s;ix or &s;even, and is immediately &s;ucceeded by an agreeable land-breeze from the mountains. The &s;ea-breeze from the ea&s;tward, however, is not &s;o con&s;tant here, as in the We&s;t In|dies between the tropics, becau&s;e the &s;un, which produces it, is not &s;o powerful. This country lies
<PB N="92" REF="94">
nearer the region of variable winds, and is &s;ur|rounded by mountains, capes, and &s;traits, which often influence the con&s;titution and current of air. About the winter &s;ol&s;tice, the people of Nice expect wind and rain, which generally la&s;ts, with intervals, till the beginning of February: but, even during this their wor&s;t weather, the &s;un breaks out occa&s;ion|ally, &s;o as to enable any one to take the air every day, either on foot or hor&s;eback, the moi&s;ture being immediately ab&s;orbed by the earth, which is natu|rally dry. The heavy rains in this country gene|rally come with a &s;outh-we&s;t wind, which was the <HI>creberque procellis Africus</HI> of the ancients. It is here called <HI>Lebeche,</HI> a corruption of <HI>Lybicus;</HI> it ge|nerally blows high for a day or two, and rolls the Mediterranean before it in huge waves, that often enter the town of Nice. It likewi&s;e drives before it all the clouds which had been found above the &s;ur|face of the Mediterranean. The&s;e being expended in rain, fair-weather naturally en&s;ues. There are frequent in&s;tances of Engli&s;h valetudinarians, who have pa&s;&s;ed the winter at Aix on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that there was little or no difference between the air and the climate of Nice; but this is a very great mi&s;take, which may be attended with very fatal con&s;equences. Aix is altogether expo&s;ed to the north and northwe&s;t winds, which blow as cold in Provence as on the mountains of Scotland: whereas,
<PB N="93" REF="95">
Nice is entirely &s;creened from the&s;e winds by the maritime Alps, which form an amphitheatre to the land &s;ide around this little territory. Another in|conte&s;tible proof of the mildne&s;s of this climate is deduced from the oranges, lemons, citrons, ro&s;es, narci&s;&s;u&s;es, July-flowers, and jonquils, which ripen and blow in the middle of winter. Pre&s;ents of car|nations are &s;ent from hence, at that &s;ea&s;on of the year to Turin and Paris; nay, &s;ometimes as far as London, by the po&s;t. They are packed up in a wooden box, without any &s;ort of preparation, one pre&s;&s;ed upon another: the per&s;on who receives them cuts off a little bit of the &s;talk, and &s;teeps them for two hours in vinegar and water, when they recover their full bloom and beauty. They are then placed in water bottles, in an apartment &s;creened from the &s;everities of the weather, and continue there fre&s;h and unfaded for near a month.</P>
<P><HI>Smollett,</HI> de&s;cribing the cultivation of the country round Nice, &s;ays, When &s;tanding on the rampart and looking round me, I can &s;carce help thinking my&s;elf enchanted. The &s;mall extent of country, which I &s;ee, is all cultivated like a garden. Indeed, the plain pre|&s;ents nothing but gardens full of green trees, loaded with oranges, lemons, citrons, and bergamots, which make a delightful appearance. If examined more narrowly, there will be &s;een plantations of
<PB N="94" REF="96">
green peas, ready to be gathered; all &s;orts of &s;allet|ing, and pot-herbs in perfection; plats of ro&s;es, car|nations, ranunculu&s;es, anemonies, and daffodils, blowing in full glory, with &s;uch beauty, vigour, and perfume, as no flower in England ever exhibited.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the plantations in this neighbourhood ap|pear a va&s;t number of <HI>ba&s;tides</HI> or country hou&s;es, which make a dazzling &s;how. They are all built &s;quare; and, being whitened with lime or plai&s;ter, contribute greatly to the richne&s;s of the view. The hills are &s;haded to the tops with olive-trees, which are always green; and tho&s;e hills are over-topped with more di&s;tant mountains covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more unpromi&s;ing, however, than the natural &s;oil of this territory, except in a very few narrow bottoms, where there is a &s;tiff clay, which, when carefully watered, yields tolerable pa&s;|turage. In every other part the &s;oil con&s;i&s;ts of a light &s;and, mingled with pebbles, which &s;erves well enough for the culture of vines and olives; but the ground laid out for kitchen herbs, as well as for other fruits, mu&s;t be manured with care and atten|tion. They have no black cattle to afford &s;uch compo&s;t as is u&s;ed in England. The dung of mules and a&s;&s;es, their only bea&s;ts of burthen, is of very little value for this purpo&s;e, and the natural
<PB N="95" REF="97">
&s;terility of their ground requires &s;omething highly impregnated with nitre and vegetable &s;alts. They are obliged, therefore, to have recour&s;e to pigeons dung and ordure. Every pea&s;ant opens, at one corner of his wall, a public-hou&s;e of office for the reception of pa&s;&s;engers; and, in the town of Nice, every te|nement is provided with one of the&s;e receptacles, the contents of which are carefully pre&s;erved for &s;ale. The pea&s;ant comes with his a&s;&s;es and ca&s;ks to carry it off before day, and pays for it according to its quality. The jakes of a prote&s;tant family, who eat <HI>gras</HI> every day, bear a much higher price than the privy of a good catholic, who lives <HI>maigre</HI> one half of the year. The vaults belonging to the con|vent of Minims, are not worth emptying.</P>
<P>The ground here is not delved with &s;pades, as in England, but laboured with a broad &s;harp hough, with a horizontal handle; and the climate is &s;o hot and dry in the &s;ummer, that the plants mu&s;t be wa|tered every morning and evening, e&s;pecially where it is not &s;haded by trees. It is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee in what manner the productions of the earth are crouded together. Olive and other fruit-trees are planted in rows very clo&s;e to each other. The&s;e are connected by vines, and the inter&s;tice between the roots are filled with corn. The gardens, that &s;upply the town with &s;allad and pot-herbs, lie all on
<PB N="96" REF="98">
the &s;ide of Provence by the highway. They are &s;urrounded with high &s;tone-walls, or ditches planted with a kind of cane or large reed, which an&s;wers many purpo&s;es in this country. The leaves of it afford &s;u&s;tenance to the a&s;&s;es, and the canes not only &s;erve as fences to the inclo&s;ures; but are u&s;ed to prop the vines and peas: they are further formed into arbours, and wore as walking &s;ticks. All the&s;e gardens are watered by little rills that come from the mountains, particularly by the &s;mall branches of the two &s;ources of the Var and the Paglion.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Nice they rai&s;e a con|&s;iderable quantity of hemp, which is remarkably large and &s;trong. Part of this, when dre&s;&s;ed, is exported to other countries, and part is manufac|tured into cordage. However profitable it may be to the grower, it is certainly a great nui&s;ance in the &s;ummer. When taken, out of the pits, where it has been put to rot, the &s;tench it rai&s;es is in&s;up|portable, and mu&s;t undoubtedly be prejudicial to the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>There is &s;uch a want of land in this neighbour|hood that terraces are built over one another with loo&s;e &s;tones, on the faces of bare rocks, and the&s;e
<PB N="97" REF="99">
being covered with earth and manured, are planted with olives, vines, and corn.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;mall extent of this terri|tory, there are &s;ome plea&s;ant meadows in the &s;kirts of Nice, that produce excellent clover; and the corn, which is &s;own in the open fields, grows to a &s;urpri&s;ing height. Rye may be &s;een here &s;even or eight feet high. All vegetables have a wonderful growth in this climate. Be&s;ides wheat, rye, barley, and oats, this country produces a good deal of In|dian corn. The meal of this grain goes by the name of <HI>polenta,</HI> and make excellent ha&s;ty pudding, being very nouri&s;hing, and counted an admirable pectoral. The pods and &s;talks are u&s;ed for fuel; and the leaves are much preferable to common &s;traw, for making <HI>pailla&s;&s;es.</HI> Myrtle, &s;weet-briar, &s;weet-marjoram, &s;age, thyme, lavender, ro&s;emary, with many other aromatic herbs and flowers, which, with us, require the mo&s;t careful cultivation, are here found wild in the mountains.</P>
<P>The markets at Nice are well &s;upplied. In au|tumn and winter, the &s;ea&s;ons for game, hares, par|tridges, quails, wild pigeons, woodcocks, &s;nipes, thru&s;hes, beccaficas, and ortolans, are met with in great plenty. The wild boar is &s;ometimes found in the mountains: it has a delicious ta&s;te, not unlike that
<PB N="98" REF="100">
of the wild hog, in Jamaica, when meagre the head only is pre&s;ented at tables. Phea&s;ants are very &s;carce. As for the heath game, &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> I never &s;aw but one cock, which my &s;ervant bought in the market, and brought home; but the com|mandants cook came into my kitchen, and carried it off, after it was half plucked, &s;aying his ma&s;ter had company to dinner. The hares are large, plump, and juicy; the partridges generally of the red &s;ort, large as pullets, and of a good flavour; there are al&s;o &s;ome grey partridges in the moun|tains, and another &s;ort of a white colour, that weigh four or five pounds each. Beccaficas are &s;maller than &s;parrows, and generally eaten half raw. The ortolans are kept in cages, and crammed till they die of fat, and then eaten as dainties. The thru&s;h is pre&s;ented with the trail, becau&s;e the bird &s;eeds on olives. They may as well eat the trail of a &s;heep, becau&s;e it feeds on the aromatic herbs of the mountains.</P>
<P>Nice is not without a variety of fi&s;h. Here are &s;ometimes mullets both red and grey. One of the be&s;t fi&s;h in this country is called <HI>le loup,</HI> about two or three pounds in weight, white, firm, and well flavoured. Another no way inferior to it is the <HI>mou&s;tel,</HI> by &s;ome thought to be the <HI>mu&s;tela</HI> of the ancients or &s;ea lam|prey. There is al&s;o abundance of the $oepie or cut|tle-fi&s;h,
<PB N="99" REF="101">
of which the people in this country make a delicate ragout; as al&s;o of the <HI>polype de mer,</HI> which is an ugly animal, with long feelers, like tails, which they often wind about the legs of the fi&s;hermen. They are &s;tewed with onions, and eat &s;omething like cow-heel.</P>
<P>Among the fi&s;h of this country there is a very ugly animal, of the eel &s;pecies, which might pa&s;s for a &s;erpent. The Italians call it <HI>murena,</HI> but whe|ther it is the fi&s;h which had the &s;ame name among the ancient Romans is not &s;o ea&s;y to determine. The ancient <HI>murena</HI> were counted a great delicacy, and kept in ponds for extraordinary occa&s;ions. Ju|lius Cae&s;ar borrowed 6000 for one entertainment. The &s;word-fi&s;h is al&s;o much e&s;teemed at Nice, and called <HI>l'Empereur,</HI> about &s;ix or &s;even feet long; it is as white as the fine&s;t veal, and extremely delicate. They are very &s;carce, and when taken are generally concealed, becau&s;e the head belongs to the Com|mandant, who has likewi&s;e the privilege of buying the be&s;t fi&s;h at a very low price; for which rea&s;on the choice pieces are concealed by the fi&s;hermen, and &s;ent privately to Piedmont or Genoa. Sea turtle are al&s;o often found at &s;ea, by the mariners, in the&s;e latitudes, but they are not the green &s;ort, &s;o much in reque&s;t among the City Aldermen. All the Mediterranean turtle are of the kind called logger-head,
<PB N="100" REF="102">
which in the We&s;t Indies are eaten by none but hungry &s;eamen, negroes, and the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of people. One of the&s;e, weighing about 200lb. &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> was brought on &s;hore by the fi&s;hermen of Nice, who found it floating, a&s;leep, on the &s;urface of the &s;ea. The whole town was alarmed at the fight of &s;uch a mon&s;ter, the nature of which they could not comprehend. However, the Monks called <HI>Minims,</HI> of <HI>St. Francis's</HI> order, guided by an unerring in&s;tinct, marked it as their prey, and &s;ur|rounded it accordingly. The Friars of other con|vents, not quite &s;o hungry as tho&s;e of the order of <HI>St. Francis,</HI> crowding down to the beach, declared it &s;hould not be eaten, dropped hints of a po&s;&s;ibility it might be &s;omething preternatural and diabolical, and even propo&s;ed exorci&s;ms and emer&s;ions with holy water. The populace were divided, accord|ing to their attachment to this or that convent; a mighty clamour aro&s;e; and the Police, to remove the cau&s;e of their contention, ordered the tortoi&s;e to be re-committed to the waves; a &s;entence which the <HI>Franci&s;ians</HI> &s;aw executed, not without &s;ighs and lamentations.</P>
<P>But the chief fi&s;heries of this coa&s;t are of the &s;ar|dines, anchovies and tunnies. The&s;e are taken in &s;mall quantities all the year, but &s;pring and &s;ummer are the &s;ea&s;ons when they mo&s;tly abound. In June and
<PB N="101" REF="103">
July a fleet of about 50 fi&s;hing-boats put to &s;ea, every evening, about eight o'clock, and catch an|chovies in immen&s;e quantities. One &s;mall boat &s;ometimes takes in one night 600 weight. Ancho|vies, be&s;ide their making a con&s;iderable article in the commerce of Nice, are a great re&s;ource in all families. The noble&s;&s;e and bourgeois &s;up on &s;al|lad and anchovies, which are eaten on all their meagre days. The fi&s;hermen and mariners, all along this coa&s;t, have &s;carce any other food but dry bread, with a few pickled anchovies; and, when the fi&s;h is eaten, they rub their cru&s;ts with the brine. No|thing can be more delicate than fre&s;h anchovies fried in oil. It is needle&s;s to mention that the &s;ar|dines and anchovies are caught in nets, &s;alted, bar|relled, and exported into all the different kingdoms and &s;tates of Europe. The tunny-fi&s;h generally runs from 50 to 100 weight, but &s;ome of them are much larger. As &s;oon as taken they are gutted, boiled, and cut in &s;lices. The guts and head afford oil; the &s;lices are partly dried, to be eaten occa&s;ionally with oil and vinegar, or barrelled up in oil to be export|ed. It is counted a delicacy in Italy and Piedmont, and ta&s;tes not unlike &s;turgeon. The famous pickle of the ancients, called <HI>garum,</HI> was made of the gills and blood of the tunny or thynnus.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104">The vintage begins in September. The grapes being cho&s;en and carefully picked, are put into a large vat, where they are pre&s;&s;ed by a man's naked feet, and the juices drawn off by a cock below. When no more is procured by this operation, the brui&s;ed grapes are put into the pre&s;s, and yield &s;till more liquor. The juice obtained by this double pre&s;&s;ure being put in ca&s;ks, with their bungs open, begins to ferment, and di&s;charge its impurities at the openings. The wa&s;te occa&s;ioned by this di&s;|charge is con&s;tantly &s;upplied with fre&s;h wine, &s;o that the ca&s;ks are always full. The fermentation continues for 12, 15, or 20 days, according to the &s;trength and vigour of the grape. In about a month the wine is &s;it for drinking. When the grapes are of a bad, meagre kind, the wine-dealers mix the juice with pigeon's dung, or quick lime, in order to give it a &s;pirit which nature hath denied.</P>
<P>The proce&s;s for making oil is equally &s;imple. The be&s;t olives are tho&s;e that grow wild, but the quantity of them is very incon&s;iderable. Olives begin to ripen and drop in the beginning of No|vember, but &s;ome remain on the trees till February, and even till April, and the&s;e are counted the mo&s;t va|luable. When the olives are gathered, they mu&s;t be manufactured immediately, before they fade and grow wrinkled, otherwi&s;e they will produce bad oil.&mdash;
<PB N="103" REF="105">
They are fir&s;t of all ground into a pa&s;te, by a mill &s;tone, &s;et edge-ways in a circular &s;tone trough, and turned by water. This pa&s;te is put into circular ca&s;es, made of gra&s;s woven, having a round hole at top and bottom; when filled, they re&s;emble in &s;hape our Che&s;hire chee&s;es. A number of the&s;e, placed one upon another, are put in a pre&s;s, and being &s;queezed, the oil, with all its impurities, runs into a receptacle below, fixed in the ground; from hence it is ladled into a wooden vat, half filled with water. The &s;ordes or dirt falls to the bottom. The oil &s;wims on top, and, being &s;kimmed off, is bar|relled in &s;mall oblong ca&s;ks. What remains in the vat is thrown into a large &s;tone ci&s;tern with water, and, after being often &s;tirred, and &s;tanding 12 or 14 days, yields a coar&s;e oil, u&s;ed for lamps and ma|nufactures. The very fine&s;t, called virgin-oil, is made chiefly of green olives, and &s;old at a very high price, becau&s;e a great quantity is required to pro|duce a very little oil.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> People, Character, Cu&s;toms, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>NICE abounds with noble&s;&s;e. Of the&s;e, three or four families are really re&s;pectable, the re&s;t are <HI>novi homines,</HI> &s;prung from bourgeoi&s;e, who have &s;aved a little money by their occupations, and rai&s;ed them&s;elves to the rank of noble&s;&s;e by purcha&s;e. A man may buy a Marqui&s;ate in this country, as in Piedmont, for 3 or 400l. but letters of noble&s;&s;e are purcha&s;ed for 30 or 40 guineas. In Savoy, &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> there are 600 families of nobility, the greater part of which have not above 100 crowns a year to &s;upport their dignity. In the mountains of Piedmont, and even in this county of Nice, there are repre&s;entatives of very ancient and noble fa|milies reduced to the condition of common pea|&s;ants; but they &s;till retain the ancient pride of their hou&s;es, and boa&s;t of the noble blood that runs in their veins. A gentleman travelling through the mountains, was obliged to pa&s;s the night in a cot|tage
<PB N="105" REF="107">
of one of the&s;e ru&s;ticated nobles, who called to his &s;on in the evening <HI>'Chevalier, as tu donn&eacute; a manger aux cochons?'</HI> This, however, is not the ca&s;e with the noble&s;&s;e of Nice. Two or three of them have about 4 or 500 a year, the re&s;t may have about 100 pi&s;toles, ari&s;ing from the &s;ilk, oil, wine, and oranges, produced in their &s;mall plantations. Some few of the&s;e are well built, commodious, and agreeably &s;ituated. There is a public <HI>conver&s;azione</HI> every evening at the Commandant's hou&s;e. In car|nival time there is al&s;o a ball twice or thrice a week. At this a&s;&s;embly every per&s;on may dance without di&s;tinction in ma&s;querades, but after dancing they are obliged to unma&s;k, and, if burgeois, to retire. No individual can give a ball without permi&s;&s;ion of the Commandant, and then his hou&s;e is open to all ma&s;ques, without di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The poverty of the people of this country, as well as of the South of France, may be conjectured from the appearance of their dome&s;tic animals. The draught hor&s;es, mules, and a&s;&s;es of the pea&s;ants are &s;o meagre as to excite compa&s;&s;ion. There is not a dog to be &s;een in tolerable ca&s;e; and the cats are &s;o many emblems of famine, frightfully thin and dangerou&s;ly rapacious. This great poverty of the people, &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> is owing to their religion. Half of their time is lo&s;t in ob&s;erving the great
<PB N="106" REF="108">
number of fe&s;tivals, and half of their &s;ub&s;tance given to mendicant friars. But if the church oc|ca&s;ions their indigence, it likewi&s;e, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, alleviates the horrors of it, by amu&s;ing them with &s;hows, proce&s;&s;ions, and even tho&s;e very fea&s;ts which afford a rece&s;s from labour, in a country where the climate invites them to idlene&s;s. If the pea&s;ants in the neighbourhood of any chaple, dedicated to a &s;aint, have a mind to make a holiday, in other words, a fair; they apply to the Commandant of Nice for a licence which co&s;ts them a crown. This being obtained, they a&s;&s;emble after &s;ervice, men and women, in their be&s;t apparel, and dance to the mu&s;ic of fiddles, and drums. There are huck&s;ters &s;tands, with pedlary ware, and knick-knacks for pre&s;ents, cakes and bread, <HI>liqueurs</HI> and wine; and thither generally re&s;ort all the company of Nice.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of their religious in&s;titutions we can|not help ob&s;erving, that the ancient Romans were &s;till more &s;uper&s;titious than the modern Italians, and that the number of their religious fea&s;ts, fa&s;ts, and holidays, were even greater than tho&s;e of the Chri&s;tian church at Rome. The va&s;t variety of their deities, &s;aid to amount to 30,000, with their re|&s;pective rights of adoration, could not fail to intro|duce &s;uch a number of ceremonies, &s;hews, &s;acri|fices, lu&s;trations, and public proce&s;&s;ions, as mu&s;t
<PB N="107" REF="109">
have employed the people almo&s;t con&s;tantly from one end of the year to the other. This continual di&s;&s;ipation mu&s;t have been a great enemy to in|du&s;try; and the people mu&s;t therefore con&s;equently have been idle and effeminate. It perhaps would be no difficult matter to prove that there is very little difference, in point of character, between the ancient and modern inhabitants of Rome, and that the great figure, which this empire formerly made, was not &s;o much owing to the intrin&s;ic virtue of its citizens, as to the barbari&s;m, ignorance, and im|becility of the nations they &s;ubdued; and if the mo&s;t fortunate generals of the Roman common|wealth were again placed at the head of the armies they once commanded, in&s;tead of extending their conque&s;ts over all Europe and A&s;ia, I am of opi|nion, &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> they would hardly be able to &s;ubdue and retain, under their dominion, all the petty republics that &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Italy.</P>
<P>How they live in their families, &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> I do not chu&s;e to enquire, but in public, <HI>Madame</HI> ap|pears in her robe of gold, or &s;ilver &s;tuff, with her powder and <HI>fri&s;ure,</HI> her perfumes, her paint, and her patches; while <HI>Mon&s;ieur le Comte</HI> &s;truts about in his lace and embroidery. <HI>Rouge</HI> and <HI>fard</HI> are more peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary in this country, where the complexion and &s;kin are &s;warthy and yellow. Mo&s;t
<PB N="108" REF="110">
of the females are likewi&s;e pot-bellied; a circum|&s;tance owing perhaps to the great quantity of vegetable tra&s;h they eat. All the hor&s;es, mules, a&s;&s;es, and cattle, which feed upon gra&s;s have the &s;ame di&s;tention. This kind of food produces &s;uch acid juices in the &s;tomach, as excite a perpetual &s;en&s;e of hunger. I have been often amazed at the voracious appetites of the&s;e people. But it mu&s;t not be expected, &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> that I &s;hould de&s;cribe the tables and ho&s;|pitality of the Ni&s;&s;ard gentry. The Con&s;ul, who is a very hone&s;t man, told me he had lived 34 years in the country, without having once eat or drank in any of their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t fault I find with the fruits of this climate, which, with vegetables and fi&s;h, con&s;titute the principal food of the inhabitants, is that they are two &s;weet and lu&s;cious, and want that agreeable acid &s;o cooling and refre&s;hing in a hot country. Nature, however, has not neglected to provide &s;ome agreeable vegetable juices to cool the human body. During the whole &s;ummer, there is plenty of mu&s;k melons. I can buy one, as large as my head, &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> for the value of an Engli&s;h penny; but one of the be&s;t and large&s;t, weighing about 10 or 12 pounds, co&s;ts about eight-pence. From An|tibes and Sardinia, is brought another kind, called, water-melons, well known in Jamaica, and &s;ome of
<PB N="109" REF="111">
our other colonies. Tho&s;e from Antibes, are about the &s;ize of an ordinary bomb-&s;hell; but the Sar|dinian and Jamaica water-melons are four times as large. The &s;kin is green, &s;mooth, and thin. The in&s;ide is a purple pulp, &s;tudded with broad, flat, black &s;eeds, and impregnated with a juice the mo&s;t cool, delicate, and refre&s;hing, that well can be conceived. One would imagine the pulp it&s;elf di&s;&s;olved in the &s;tomach; for a per&s;on may eat of it, until he is filled up to the tongue, without feeling the lea&s;t inconvenience. It is &s;o friendly to the con&s;titution, that in ardent fevers it is drank as the be&s;t emul&s;ion. At Genoa, Florence, and Rome, it is &s;old in the &s;treets, ready cut in &s;lices; and the porters, &s;weating under their burthens, buy and eat them as they pa&s;s. A London porter quenches his thir&s;t with a draught of &s;trong beer: a porter of Rome or Naples, refre&s;hes him&s;elf with a &s;lice of water-melon, or a gla&s;s of iced water. The one co&s;ts two-pence, and the other half a far|thing; which ever of them is mo&s;t effectual, the men are equally plea&s;ed. It is commonly remarked, that beer &s;trengthens as well as refre&s;hes. But the porters of Con&s;tantinople, who never drink any thing &s;tronger than water, and eat very little animal food, will lift and carry heavier burdens, than any other porters in the known world. If we may believe the mo&s;t re&s;pectable travellers, a Turk
<PB N="110" REF="112">
will carry a load of 700 weight, which is more than any Engli&s;h porter ever attempted to rai&s;e.</P>
<P>Among the other refre&s;hments of the&s;e warm coun|tries, are the <HI>Sorbettes Soldin</HI> coffee-hou&s;es, or places of public re&s;ort. The&s;e are iced froth, made with juice of oranges, apricots, or peaches; very agree|able to the palate, and &s;o extremely cold, that a &s;tranger is afraid to &s;wallow them in this hot coun|cry, until, from information and experience, he finds they may be taken in moderation, without any bad con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The people here are not &s;o nice as the Engli&s;h in the management of their wine. It is kept in fla|cons, or large fla&s;ks, without corks, having a little oil at top, and not deemed the wor&s;e for having been opened a day or two before; and they expo&s;e it to the hot &s;un and all kinds of weather without he&s;itation. Certain it is, that this treatment has little or no effect upon its ta&s;te, flavour, and tran&s;|parency.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are built of a ragged &s;tone, dug from the mountains, and the inter&s;tices are filled with rubble, &s;o that the walls would appear very ugly if they were not covered with plai&s;ter, which has a
<PB N="111" REF="113">
very good effect. They generally con&s;i&s;t of three &s;tories, and are covered with tiles. The apartments of the better &s;ort, are large and lofty, the floors paved with brick, the roof covered with a thick coat of &s;tucco, and the walls white-wa&s;hed. People of di&s;|tinction hang their chambers with dama&s;k, &s;triped &s;ilk, painted cloths, tape&s;try, or printed linens. All the doors, as well as the windows, con&s;i&s;t of fold|ing leaves. As there is no wain&s;cot in the rooms, which are divided by &s;tone partitions, and the floors and ceilings are covered with brick and &s;tucco, fires are of le&s;s dreadful con&s;equences than in our country. The hou&s;es in general, have no chimnies, but in the kitchens; and many people, even of con|dition, have no fire in their chambers during the whole winter. When the weather happens to be a little colder than ordinary, they warm their apart|ments with a <HI>bra&s;iere</HI> of charcoal: the beds com|monly u&s;ed in this place, and all over Italy, con&s;i&s;t of a <HI>pailla&s;&s;e,</HI> with one or two mattra&s;&s;es laid upon planks, &s;upported by two wooden benches. In&s;tead of curtains, there is a <HI>couziniere,</HI> or mo&s;quito-net, made of a kind of gauze, that opens and contracts occa&s;ionally, and inclo&s;es the bed: per&s;ons of condi|tion, $word$ have bed&s;teads and curtains; but the&s;$ $span$</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="114">Though Nice it&s;elf retains few marks of ancient &s;plendor, there are con&s;iderable marks of antiquity in its neighbourhood. About two &s;hort miles from the town, upon the &s;ummit of a pretty high hill, we find the ruins of the ancient city of Cemenelion, now called Cimia, once the metropolis of the mari|time Alps, and the &s;eat of the Roman Pre&s;ident. With re&s;pect to &s;ituation nothing could be more agreeable or &s;alubrious. It &s;tood upon the gentle a&s;cent and &s;ummit of a hill, fronting the Mediter|ranean, from the &s;hore of which it is di&s;tant about half a league; and on the other &s;ide, it overlooked a bottom, or narrow vale, through which the Pag|lion, anciently called <HI>Paulo,</HI> runs towards the walls of Nice. It was inhabited by a people whom <HI>Ptolemy</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> call the <HI>Vedantic,</HI> but the&s;e were undoubtedly mixed with a Roman colony, as ap|pears by the monuments &s;till remaining; which are the ruins of an amphitheatre, a temple of Apol|lo, baths, aqueducts, &s;epulchral and other &s;tones with in&s;criptions, and a great number of medals, which have been found by accident in digging and labouring the vineyards and corn fields, which cover the ground where the city &s;tood.</P>
<P>The amphitheatre is but very &s;mall compared to that of Nismes. The <HI>arena</HI> is ploughed up, and bears corn; &s;ome of the &s;eats remain, and part of
<PB N="113" REF="115">
two oppo&s;ite porticos; but all the columns, and the external facade, are taken away. About 100 paces from the amphitheatre &s;tood an ancient temple, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been dedicated to Apollo. The part called the Ba&s;ilica, and about one half of the <HI>cella &s;anctior</HI> remain. In the latter chamber, &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> I found a lean cow, a he-goat, and a jack|a&s;s; the very &s;ame conjunction of animals I had &s;een drawing a plough in Burgundy.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Commerce, Government, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief commerce of this place is a contraband traffic, carried on to the di&s;advantage of France. A great quantity of merchandi&s;e is brought here every week by mules from Turin, and other parts of Piedmont, and afterwards conveyed to the other &s;ide of the Var, either by land or by water. The mules of Piedmont are exceeding &s;trong and hardy. One of them will carry a burthen of near
<PB N="114" REF="116">
600 weight. They are ea&s;ily nouri&s;hed, and require no other re&s;pite from their labour but the night's re|po&s;e. They are the only carriage that can be u&s;ed in cro&s;&s;ing the mountains, being very &s;ure footed; and it is ob&s;erved, that in chu&s;ing their &s;teps, they always march upon the brink of the precipice. If they are not permitted to take their own way, the rider is in danger of lo&s;ing his life, for they are ob&s;tinate even to de&s;peration. It is very dangerous to meet the&s;e animals on hor&s;eback; they have &s;uch an aver|&s;ion to hor&s;es that they will attack them with incre|dible fury, &s;o as even to tear them and their riders in pieces; and the be&s;t method for avoiding this fate is, to clap &s;purs to one's hor&s;e, and &s;eek &s;afety in flight. They always give &s;ufficient warning, by rai&s;|ing a hidious braying, as &s;oon as they perceive a hor&s;e at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Some very fea&s;ible &s;chemes for improving the commerce of Nice have been pre&s;ented to the mini&s;|try of Turin, but hitherto without &s;ucce&s;s. The Engli&s;h import annually between 2 and 3000 bales of raw &s;ilk, the growth of Piedmont; and this is im|ported either from Genoa or Leghorn. Fruit and oil are likewi&s;e &s;ent over in great quantities from the neighbouring places, there not being &s;ufficient depth of water for &s;hips of any burthen to approach Nice; the harbour likewi&s;e wants to be made more com|modious
<PB N="115" REF="117">
and &s;ecure. There is an excellent harbour however, it &s;eems, at Villa Franca, not more than a mile and a half from that of Nice; but the great objection to the improvement of commerce at Nice, according to <HI>Smollett,</HI> is the want of money, indu&s;try, and character. The natives them&s;elves are, in ge|neral, &s;uch dirty knaves, that no foreigners will tru&s;t them in the way of trade. They have been known to fill their oil-ca&s;ks half full of water, and their anchovy barrels with &s;tinking heads of that fi&s;h, in order to cheat their corre&s;pondents.</P>
<P>The &s;hopkeepers of this place are generally poor, greedy, and over-reaching. Many of them are bankrupts of Mar&s;eilles, Genoa, and other countries who have fled from their creditors to Nice; which, being a free port, affords an a&s;ylum to foreign cheats, and &s;harpers of every denomination. Here is like|wi&s;e a pretty con&s;iderable number of Jews, who live in a &s;treet appropriated for them, which is &s;hut up every night. They act as brokers, but are generally poor, and deal in frippery, old cloaths, remnants, and hou&s;hold-furniture.</P>
<P>There is another branch of commerce engro&s;&s;ed by the Monks. Some convents, of which there are many in this town, have &s;uch a number of ma&s;&s;es. bequeathed them, that they find it impo&s;&s;ible to
<PB N="116" REF="118">
execute the will of the donors. In this ca&s;e they agree by the lump with the Friars of poorer convents, who &s;ay the ma&s;&s;es for le&s;s money than has been al|lowed by the defunct, and their employers pocket the difference; for example, &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> my grand|father bequeaths a &s;um of money to a certain convent, to have &s;uch a number of ma&s;&s;es &s;aid for the repo&s;e of his &s;oul, at ten &s;ols each; and this convent, not having time to perform them, bargains with the Friars of another to &s;ay them for &s;ix &s;ols each, &s;o that they gain four &s;ols upon every ma&s;s; for it matters not to the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed where they are &s;aid, &s;o they be properly authenticated.&mdash; A poor gentleman of Nice, (adds the above Writer) who piques him&s;elf much on the noble blood that runs in his veins, though he has not a whole pair of breeches to wear, complained to me, that his great-grandmother had founded a perpetual ma&s;s for the repo&s;e of her own &s;oul, at the rate of 15 &s;ols, (nine|pence Engli&s;h) a-day; which indeed was all that now remained of the family e&s;tate. He &s;aid, what made the hard&s;hip greater on him, &s;he had been dead above 50 years, and in all probability her &s;oul had got out of purgatory long ago, therefore the continuance of the ma&s;s was an unnece&s;&s;ary expence. I told him, I thought, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the defunct &s;hould appear before a Civil Magi&s;trate, and make affidavit of her being at peace, for the advantage of
<PB N="117" REF="119">
the family. After mu&s;ing &s;ome time, he &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders and &s;aid, where the intere&s;t of the church was at &s;take, he did not believe a &s;pirit's declaration would be held legal evidence." In &s;ome parts of France the <HI>cur&eacute;</HI> of the pari&s;h, on All Souls' Day, which is called <HI>Jours des Morts,</HI> &s;ays a prayer, for two &s;ols, at every grave in the bu|rying-ground, for the relea&s;e of the &s;oul who&s;e body is there interred.</P>
<P>The citizens of Nice are lazy, needy, very awk|ward, and void of all ingenuity. The price of their labour is very near as high as at London or Paris. The lowe&s;t cla&s;s of people have all the outward &s;igns of extreme mi&s;ery. They are all diminutive, mea|gre, withered, dirty, and half naked; in their com|plexions not barely &s;warthy, but black as Moors. They are, many of them, very hard favoured, and their women in general have the coar&s;e&s;t features imagina|ble; it mu&s;t be owned, however, they have the fine&s;t teeth in the world. They are remarkably re|&s;pectful and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to their &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>The populace of Nice are very quiet and orderly, little addicted to drunkenne&s;s, riots are never heard of, and murder and robbery are altogether un|known. A man may walk alone over the county of Nice, at midnight, without danger of in|&s;ult.
<PB N="118" REF="120">
The police is well regulated. No one is per|mitted to wear a pi&s;tol or dagger, on pain of being &s;ent on board the gallies. In Nice the common people retire to their lodgings at eight o'clock in winter, and nine in &s;ummer. Every per&s;on found in the &s;treets after the&s;e hours, is apprehended by the patrole, and if he cannot give a good account of him&s;elf is &s;ent to pri&s;on. At nine in winter, and ten in &s;ummer, the <HI>curfew</HI> bell is rung, warning people to put out their lights and go to bed. This is a very nece&s;&s;ary precaution in towns liable to conflagra|tions, but of &s;mall u&s;e in Nice, where there is little combu&s;tible in the hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hments inflicted upon malefactors at Nice are, hanging for capital crimes; &s;lavery on board the gallies, for a limited term or for life, ac|cording to the nature of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; flaggella|tion and the &s;trappado. This la&s;t puni&s;hment is per|formed by hoi&s;ting up the criminal, with his hands tied behind his back, on a pully, about two &s;tories high; from whence the rope being &s;uddenly &s;lack|ened, he falls to within a yard or two of the ground, where he is &s;topped with a violent &s;hock, ari&s;ing from the weight of his body, and the velocity of his de&s;cent, which generally di&s;locates his &s;houlders with incredible pain. This dreadful execution is &s;ometimes repeated in a few minutes on the &s;ame de|linquent,
<PB N="119" REF="121">
&s;o that the very ligaments are torn from his joints, and his arms rendered u&s;ele&s;s for life.</P>
<P>The government of Nice is in the hands of a &s;e|nate, con&s;i&s;ting of a Pre&s;ident, and a certain number of Senators, who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their purple robes, and other en&s;igns of authority. They admi|ni&s;ter ju&s;tice, having the power of life and death, not only through the whole county of Nice, but cau&s;es are evoked from Onelia, and &s;ome other places in the neighbourhood, to their tribunal, which is the <HI>dernier re&s;ort,</HI> from whence there is no appeal. The Commandant, however, by virtue of his mili|tary power, and unre&s;trained authority, takes upon him to puni&s;h individuals by impri&s;onment, corporal pains, and bani&s;hment, without con&s;ulting the &s;enate, or indeed ob&s;erving any form of trial. The only re|dre&s;s again&s;t unju&s;t exerci&s;e of this ab&s;olute power is, by complaint to the King.</P>
<P>The King is &s;aid to draw from Nice, 100,000 li|vres annually, ari&s;ing from a free gift, amounting to 700l. in lieu of the <HI>trille,</HI> from which this country is exempted; an incon&s;iderable duty upon wine, and and the <HI>droits de po&s;t.</HI> The&s;e la&s;t con&s;i&s;t of anchor|age, paid by all ve&s;&s;els in proportion to their ton|nage, when they enter the harbour of Nice and Villa Franca. Be&s;ides all foreign ve&s;&s;els under a &s;tipulated

burthen pa&s;&s;ing between the i&s;land of Sardinia and this coa&s;t, are obliged in going to the ea&s;tward, to enter and pay a certain &s;tipulated impo&s;ition, on pain of being taken and made prizes of. The Prince of Monaco exacts a talliage of the &s;ame kind; and both he and the King of Sardinia maintain armed cruizers to a&s;&s;i&s;t this prerogative: from which, however, the Engli&s;h and French are exempted by treaty, in con|&s;equence of a &s;um of money having been paid at once. In all probability, it was originally given for maintaining lights on the coa&s;t, like the toll paid for pa&s;&s;ing the &s;ound in the Baltic. The fanal, or lan|thorn, to the ea&s;tward of Villa Franca, is kept in good repair, and &s;till lighted in the winter. The toll, however, is very trouble&s;ome to feluccas, and other &s;mall craft, who are very much retarded, and often lo&s;e the benefit of a fair wind, by being obliged to run in &s;hore, and enter the&s;e harbours.</P>
<P>The whole county of Nice is &s;aid to yield the King half a million of livres, or about 25000 pounds &s;terling, exclu&s;ive of the revenue he draws from the city. If we may believe the politicians of Nice, the King of Sardinia's revenues which he draws from Nice, exceed the double of this &s;um. It mu&s;t be owned, that there is no country in Chri&s;tendom, le&s;s taxed, than Nice; and as the &s;oil produces the nece&s;&s;aries of life, the inhabitants, with a little in|du&s;try,
<PB N="121" REF="123">
might renew the golden age in this happy climate. In the mid&s;t of the pa&s;toral advantages to be found in it, the pea&s;ants are poor and mi&s;erable; they have no &s;tock to begin the world with, nor have they any lea&s;es of the lands they cultivate, but entirely depend from year to year on the plea|&s;ure of the arbitrary land-holder; after all, the ground is too &s;canty for the number of families crowded on it.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;tate of the arts and &s;ciences of Nice, there is, in this particular, almo&s;t a total blank. This country &s;eems at pre&s;ent con&s;ecrated to dulne&s;s and &s;uper&s;tition. It is very &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee a people, e&s;tabli&s;hed between two enlightened na|tions, &s;o devoid of ta&s;te and literature. Here are no tolerable pictures, bu&s;ts, &s;tatues, nor edifices, the very ornaments of the churches are wretchedly con|ceived, and wor&s;e executed. They have no public nor private libraries that afford any thing worth pe|ru&s;ing. There is not &s;o much as a &s;ingle book&s;eller in Nice. Though they value them&s;elves on being natives of Italy, they are unacquainted with mu&s;ic. The few that play upon any in&s;truments, attend only to the execution. They have no genius nor ta&s;te, nor any knowledge of harmony and compo&s;ition. Among the French, a Ni&s;&s;ard piques him&s;elf on being pro|vincial; but in Florence, Milan, or Rome, he claims
<PB N="122" REF="124">
the honour of being a native of Italy. The people of con|dition, &s;peak both languages equally well, or rather equally ill; for they u&s;e a low uncouth phra&s;eology. Their vernacular tongue, is what they call <HI>Patois,</HI> though in &s;o calling it, they do it inju&s;tice. <HI>Patois,</HI> from the Latin word <HI>patavinitas,</HI> means no more than a provincial accent or dialect. It takes its name from <HI>Patavium,</HI> or Padua, the birth place of Livy, who with all his merit, as a writer, has admitted in|to his hi&s;tory &s;ome provincial expre&s;&s;ions of his own country. The <HI>Patois,</HI> or native tongue of Nice, is no other than the ancient Provencal, from which the Italian, Spani&s;h, and French languages have been formed. This is the language that ro&s;e upon the ruins of the Latin tongue, after the irruption of the Goths, Vandals, Huns, and Burgundians, by whom the Roman empire was de&s;troyed. It was &s;poken all over Italy, Spain, and the &s;outhern parts of France, until the 13th century, when the Italians began to poli&s;h it into the language they now call their own. The Spaniards, and French likewi&s;e, improved it into their re&s;pective tongues.</P>

<HEAD>MILAN.</HEAD>
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> Climate, Lakes, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Duchy is bounded on the We&s;t by Savoy, Piedmont, and Montferat, on the North by Switzerland; on the Ea&s;t by the Venetian territo|ries, and the Duchies of Mantua, Parma, and Pla|centia, and on the South by the dependencies of the republic of Genoa. Its greate&s;t breadth, from North to South, is 100 Engli&s;h miles, and its length, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t 120 miles. Scarce any country throughout Europe is more fertile in a variety of excellent productions. Every where it is watered either by rivulets or canals; and, after the harve&s;ts of the u&s;ual kinds of grain, the people &s;ow Turkey wheat, chiefly on ac|count
<PB N="124" REF="126">
of their poultry, which they have in great plenty, and very excellent. The pea&s;ants al&s;o make bread of this wheat, and, when mixed with rye, it is even u&s;ed by people in good circum&s;tances. It is not above a century &s;ince this vegetable has been introduced into the&s;e parts, and in the opinion of &s;ome, to the great di&s;advantage of the country; for this &s;ort of grain is thought of &s;uch a quality as not only to impoveri&s;h the land, and render it barren, but likewi&s;e to be prejudicial to the health, both of the farmers, who &s;ow and reap it, and of tho&s;e who eat the Maliga bread. That the cultivation of rice has done no good either to the &s;oil, or the inha|bitants, is a matter of &s;uch certainty in Piedmont, that it is ab&s;olutely prohibited. Upon entering the Milane&s;e, one meets with it in great quantities, where it is allowed, with this re&s;triction; that it is not to be &s;own near any town: and about three miles on this &s;ide Novari is a &s;tone &s;et up as a boundary to the &s;owing of rice. The whole world does not afford a tract of land &s;o well watered as the Milane&s;e; and as the ditches and canals, every where divide the fields and meadows, no place can be better adapted for rice. After it is &s;own, the ground is laid under water, and continues &s;o till the rice be ripe; but the pernicious effects of the deficcation of &s;uch a mar&s;hy &s;oil, are but too con&s;picuous in the violent head-achs, vertigoes and fluxes, with which tho&s;e
<PB N="125" REF="127">
per&s;ons are &s;eized, who, in &s;ummer, only travel along roads adjoining to the rice-grounds.</P>
<P>The fertility of the &s;oil is &s;o great, in mo&s;t parts of the Milane&s;e, as to yield two crops in a year. The corn &s;owed in the autumn of the preceding year ripens in June; and this is no &s;ooner carried in, but the ground is a &s;econd time &s;own with barley, Turkey wheat, &amp;c. which is reaped in the month of November. The pa&s;tures are very rich, e&s;pe|cially in the di&s;trict of Lodi, which is famous for the breeding of cattle. The chee&s;e made in the country, improperly called Parme&s;an, is u&s;ed all over Italy, in the be&s;t &s;oups. Here is al&s;o excel|lent wine, and all manner of vegetables, and fruit in perfection; together with a very con&s;iderable number of mulberry trees, for &s;ilk. The charms of the country are be&s;ides heightened by three large lakes.</P>
<P>The Lago Magiore, or Lago di Locarno, is &s;ixty five Italian miles in length, and &s;ix in breadth in mo&s;t places, and its depth, about the mid|dle, eight fathoms. Towards Switzerland, it terminates in a canal of infinite convenience for commerce. The journey to Geneva, through Sion, takes up four days, but the road is extremely bad. Near Ce&s;ti the lake di&s;charges it&s;elf into the river
<PB N="126" REF="128">
Ticino, which is properly the eflux of Lago Mag|giore; and at its beginning, the current is &s;o rapid, as with the help of a &s;ingle oar, to carry a boat thirty miles in three hours, but this rapidity, when the water is low, makes it dangerous. The quickne&s;s of pa&s;&s;age on the river, is balanced by the want of di&s;|patch on the canal, which is cut from the river to Milan, and is thirty miles in length. The boat being drawn by hor&s;es moves &s;o &s;lowly that it takes up a whole day to reach Milan. However, this canal is of very great advantage to Milan, for by means of this, and the Lago Maggiore, it carries on a trade with &s;everal provinces of Germany, Swit|zerland, and France.</P>
<P>This Lake is every way environed with hills covered with vineyards, and &s;ummer-hou&s;es. Above the vineyards are plantations of che&s;nut-trees, the fruit of which, in the Northern part of Italy, are con&s;umed in &s;uch quantities, that, when che&s;nuts are in great plenty, the price of corn falls, e&s;pecially at Genoa. They continue fre&s;h and green till Chri&s;t|mas; but the common people eat them till Ea&s;ter. Along the banks of the lake are fine rows of trees, and walks arched with vine-branches. This fine pro&s;pect is further heightened by large ca&s;cades, falling from the mountains.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129">Two leagues from Ce&s;ti, the lake begins to widen, and pre&s;ents to view the two celebrated i&s;lands <HI>I&s;ola Madre,</HI> and <HI>I&s;ola Bella.</HI> The&s;e two i&s;lands can be compared to nothing more properly, than two py|ramids of &s;weetmeats, ornamented with green fe&s;|toons and flowers. In the garden of <HI>I&s;ola Bella,</HI> are ten terra&s;&s;es, and the perpendicular height of the&s;e, taken together, is 60 ells above the &s;urface of the water. The&s;e terra&s;&s;es proportionably decrea&s;e in their circumference towards the top of the hill. The oblong area on the &s;ummit, affords a mo&s;t charming pro&s;pect; is paved with fine &s;tone, and &s;urrounded with a balu&s;trade. It is in length from 45 to 50 common paces, and on every &s;ide &s;tands a range of marble &s;tatues in the gigantic ta&s;te. Round every terra&s;s is a plea&s;ant walk, and at the four angles, are large &s;tatues and pyramids, placed alternately. The walls from the bottom to the top, are covered with laurel hedges, and e&s;pa|liers of orange, lemon, peach-trees, &amp;c. The an|nual charge of the&s;e <HI>Borromean</HI> paradi&s;es amount to 40,000 Piedmonte&s;e livres: but to rai&s;e &s;o no|ble a &s;uper&s;tructure, on &s;uch a foundation, and to bring the&s;e i&s;lands to their pre&s;ent incompara|ble beauty and magnificence, &s;eems an under|taking beyond even the revenue of a prince to compa&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130">The&s;e i&s;lands belong to the <HI>Borromeo</HI> family; they were, no longer ago than the middle of the la&s;t century, only a barren rock, to which every ba&s;ket of earth, and every thing that is found there, mu&s;t have been brought at a prodigious expence. The garden of <HI>I&s;ola Bella,</HI> has a &s;outh a&s;pect, and at the two angles of its facade, are two round towers, with very lofty apartments, adorned with red and black marble. Near the towers, is an in&s;cription, &s;igni|fying that Count <HI>Borromeo,</HI> by the foundation under|neath, and the edifices erected on the&s;e rugged mi&s;hapen rocks, imparted a dignity to his lei&s;ure, and grandeur to his amu&s;ements, 1671.</P>
<P>In the palace, though not compleated, are great numbers of fine pictures, va&s;es, bu&s;ts, and other curio&s;ities. Among the paintings, the flower pieces, &s;ome of which are painted upon marble, cannot be &s;ufficiently admired. Several of the chambers are hung with portraits of the <HI>Borromeo</HI> family. The vaults, on which the palace &s;tands, are conti|guous to the lake, and, like grottos, decorated with marble and &s;hell work. The floor is a kind of Mo&s;aic work, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mall &s;tones, &s;o as to repre&s;ent all &s;orts of figures. Be&s;ides this a&s;&s;em|blage of the beauties of art and nature, the lake, with its undulating waves, continually wa&s;hes the entrance of the grottos, &s;o that a more delightful

&s;ummer retreat, can hardly be imagined. Towards the &s;outh, and clo&s;e behind the hou&s;e, are five lofty cypre&s;s trees, of an extraordinary largene&s;s, equal|ling the palace in height, and the &s;tems are covered with a thick foliage of ever-green oaks to the very ground. In going from the hou&s;e, towards the garden, the &s;mell is immediately refre&s;hed with the united odors of fruit and flowers. The fir&s;t <HI>contra e&s;palier,</HI> after a&s;cending a few &s;teps, con&s;i&s;ts of burgamot, lemon, or citron trees; next to this appears a high range of orange-trees, beyond this is a lofty grotto, adorned with water-works and &s;tatues: over its centre, is a unicorn, of an enor|mous &s;ize, in a &s;pringing attitude, with a Cupid on his back. On both &s;ides there is an a&s;cent by &s;teps to the oblong area, which terminates the ten terra&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>From <HI>I&s;ola Bella</HI> to <HI>I&s;ola Madre,</HI> is about half an hour's &s;ailing. The latter has &s;even terra&s;&s;es, which are high but &s;loping, and at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other, &s;o that it appears to the eye to be lower than <HI>I&s;ola Bella,</HI> but they are of an equal height, according to the original plans. The greate&s;t part of the foundation of <HI>I&s;ola Madre,</HI> is a high perpen|dicular rock, projecting con&s;iderably over the &s;ur|face of the water. The hou&s;e is nothing remark|able, that front only being completeed which looks
<PB N="130" REF="132">
towards <HI>I&s;ola Bella,</HI> however, it is not without fine paintings, flowers, land&s;capes, &amp;c. The garden al&s;o abounds with beauties; among the&s;e, are a fine e&s;palier of citron-trees, with a low <HI>contra e&s;palier</HI> of orange-trees, an arched walk of cedars, a &s;maller e&s;palier of je&s;&s;amin, an e&s;palier of acacia, and ano|ther of ro&s;emary, not le&s;s than eight feet in height. with &s;tems of the thickne&s;s of a man's arm. Here are al&s;o &s;everal &s;mall groves of laurel, with walks cut through them; &s;ome of the&s;e trees are of an uncom|mon thickne&s;s. An e&s;palier of laurels, in this cli|mate, will &s;hoot up to the height of eighteen feet, in &s;ix or &s;even years. There is a little hou&s;e built in this i&s;land for the phea&s;ants, and near it is a beauti|ful grove of very lofty cypre&s;s-trees: each row con|&s;i&s;ts of twenty-five trees, which &s;pread very wide in circumference, and the trunks are of the thickne&s;s of a man's body. This appears the fine&s;t part of the i&s;land, and is &s;o beautiful, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> that it na|turally recals to ones mind, the fabulous de&s;criptions of enchanted i&s;lands. He has given views of them.</P>
<P>The Lago di Lugano, is 20 miles in length, and the Lago di Como, 36, with an arm pro|jecting from the North-we&s;t, to the South-Ea&s;t, till at la&s;t it becomes a regular river, called the Adda, which empties it&s;elf into the Po. This latter lake, &s;ays <HI>Martin,</HI> is the plea&s;ante&s;t of all tho&s;e at the foot
<PB N="131" REF="133">
of the Alps. There are large plantations of <HI>Agrumi,</HI> on the borders of it, particularly in the &s;weet environs of Tremenzina, whither many of the noble Milane&s;e retire, during the heat of &s;um|mer.</P>
<P>At Ca&s;a Simonetta, is an echo, which will repeat the human voice, 40 times, and the report of a pi&s;tol, 56 or 60 times. This is occa&s;ioned, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> by the reflection of the voice, between the oppo&s;ite pa|rallel wings of the building, which are 58 common paces from each other, and without any windows, or doors, by which the &s;ound might be di&s;&s;ipated or lo&s;t. The repetition of the &s;ound, dwells chiefly on the la&s;t &s;yllable, which might have been altered, by allow|ing a greater di&s;tance between the two wings; but po&s;&s;ibly it was apprehended, that the number of the repetitions would be dimini&s;hed by that means. The reverberations of the air, in conveying &s;ounds, are be&s;t conceived by two looking-gla&s;&s;es, alternate|ly reflecting to each other an image, which gradually fades; but whether the repetition of the &s;ound be direct or undulatory, I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;s. It is certain, that where no intermediate body op|po&s;es the motion of the air, there is no echo; and where the oppo&s;ite bodies are at too great a di&s;tance from each other, either the air impelled by the
<PB N="132" REF="134">
voice or in&s;trument, doth not reach them; or the motion is &s;o weak, that it cau&s;es but a faint echo, which cannot be heard. On the other hand, if the re&s;i&s;ting body be too near, it reflects the &s;ound too quick to be di&s;tinctly perceived. If the voice falls on an angular or convex body the reflected &s;ound diverges into &s;everal different directions, none of which form a proper angle to reach the ear. A concave or convex body indeed, reflects the &s;ound with a &s;tronger echo to one particular place, (as a concave burning gla&s;s reflects and concenters the &s;olar rays into one focus,) which is not heard by the per&s;on who fir&s;t put the air in motion, but by &s;ome others, who happen to be in the focus where the rays of &s;ound unite. This kind of echo is at|tended with no repercu&s;&s;ion, and cau&s;es only a &s;in|gle repetition of the &s;ound. Two or more bodies, placed oppo&s;ite each other, at different di&s;tances, are requi&s;ite to form a multiplied echo; or the wall at which the &s;peaker &s;tands mu&s;t have another wall, oppo&s;ite to it, &s;o as to form two parallel planes, which will alternately reflect to each other the &s;ound communicated to them with as little di&s;&s;ipa|tion as po&s;&s;ible. This la&s;t circum&s;tance is found in the two parallel wings of this &s;eat, which forming right angles, with the main body of the building, have a very &s;urpri&s;ing effect. A man's voice is re|peated above 40 times, and the report of a pi&s;tol
<PB N="133" REF="135">
above 60 by this echo: but the repetition is &s;o quick, that it is difficult to tell them, or even to mark them down, unle&s;s it be early in a morning, or in a calm &s;till evening: when the air is rather too moi&s;t or too dry, the effect is found not to an&s;wer &s;o well. <HI>Pliny</HI> mentions a wonderful echo at Olim|pia, where a gallery was contrived, &s;o as to repeat a word &s;even times.</P>
<P>The Milane&s;e are fond of rural &s;ports, and pa&s;s part of the &s;ummer, and the whole autumn in the country. Monte di Brianza, on which many of their country hou&s;es are &s;ituated, is delightful for the variety of land&s;capes, and for being well watered. Every part indeed of the &s;tate of Milan, except to the northward, which is mountainous, bears te&s;ti|mony to the beneficial effects of inigation. There are generally five crops of hay every &s;ea&s;on in the neighbourhood of Milan and in the province of Lodi, where the meadows are watered once a week during the &s;ummer, if nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVII.</HI> City of Milan.</HEAD>
<P>MILAN, the ancient capital of Lombardy, is the large&s;t city in Italy, except Rome, but though it is thought, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> rather to exceed Naples in &s;ize, it does not contain above one half the number of inhabitants. Like Rome, &s;ays <HI>Mar|tin,</HI> it has many large gardens, and like Rome too, it is well peopled in the parts that are built. This city is not to be compared for beauty and conve|nience with that of Turin, mo&s;t of the &s;treets being narrow and winding. All the hou&s;es here are co|vered with pantiles, and in many of the cro&s;s &s;treets, and at the &s;tations or places, where the public pro|ce&s;&s;ions &s;top, &s;tatues are erected, to the number of 60, &s;ome of marble, but mo&s;t of bra&s;s. The in|habitants of this city are computed to be about 300,000. Milan has 12 gates, &s;ix of which are larger than the re&s;t, and terminate &s;o many broad &s;treets, called <HI>Gli Cor&s;i;</HI> and the&s;e are the be&s;t in the whole city; but they are a great di&s;tance from the centre, and likewi&s;e from each other; a
<PB N="135" REF="137">
daily market is kept at the &s;ix great gates. There are 110 mona&s;teries in Milan, 100 oratories for religious fraternities, 170 &s;chools, and 250 churches, of which near 100 are parochial.</P>
<P>The cathedral &s;tands in the centre of the city; and, after, St. Peter's at Rome, is the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able building in Italy. It ought, by this time, to be the large&s;t in the world, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> if what they tell us be true, that it is near 400 years &s;ince it was begun, and that there has been a con&s;i|derable number of men daily employed in compleat|ing it ever &s;ince; but as the injuries which time does to the ancient parts of the fabric, keep them in con&s;tant employment, without the po&s;&s;ibility of their work being ever completed, <HI>Martial's</HI> Epigram on the Barber <HI>Eutrapelus,</HI> has been applied to them with great propriety. That poor man, it &s;eems, performed his operations &s;o very &s;lowly, that the beards of his patients, required &s;having again, on the &s;ide where he had begun, by the time he had fini&s;hed the other. No church in Chri&s;tendom is &s;o much loaded, I had almo&s;t &s;aid disfigured, with ornaments. The number of &s;tatues, within-&s;ide and without, is prodigious; they are all of marble, and many of them finely wrought.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138">The greater part cannot be di&s;tinctly &s;een from below, and therefore certainly have nothing to do above. Be&s;ides tho&s;e which are of a &s;ize, and in a &s;ituation to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;treet, there are great numbers of &s;maller &s;tatues, like fairies, peeping from the cornice, and hid among the grote&s;que ornaments, which are here in great pro|fu&s;ion. They mu&s;t have co&s;t much labour to the arti&s;ts who formed them, and are &s;till a &s;ource of toil to &s;trangers, who, in compliment to the per&s;on who harangues on the beauties of this church, which he &s;ays, is the eighth wonder of the world, are obliged to a&s;cend to the roof to have a nearer view of them.</P>
<P>This va&s;t fabric is not &s;imply incru&s;ted, which is not uncommon in Italy, but entirely built of &s;olid white marble, and &s;upported by 50 columns, &s;aid to be 84 feet high. The four pillars, under the cupola, are 28 feet in circumference. By much the fine&s;t &s;tatue, belonging to it, is that of <HI>St. Bartholomew.</HI> He appears &s;tayed, with his &s;kin flung round his middle, like a &s;a&s;h, and in the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t <HI>degag&eacute;</HI> attitude imaginable. The mu&s;cles are well expre&s;&s;ed, and the figure might be placed with great propriety, in the hall of an anatomi&s;t; but, expo&s;ed as it is, to the view of people of all profe&s;&s;ions, and of both &s;exes, it excites more
<PB N="137" REF="139">
di&s;gu&s;t and horror, than admiration. Like tho&s;e beggars, who uncover their &s;ores in the &s;treets, the arti&s;t has de&s;troyed the very effect he meant to pro|duce. This would have &s;ufficiently evinced, that the &s;tatue was not the work of <HI>Praxiteles,</HI> without the in&s;cription on the pede&s;tal.
<Q>Non me Praxiteles, &s;ed Marcus finxit Agrato.</Q>
"I am not the workman&s;hip of Praixteles, but of Marcus Agrato."</P>
<P>The in&s;ide of the choir, is ornamented by &s;ome highly e&s;teemed &s;culpture, in wood. From the roof, hangs a ca&s;e of cry&s;tal, enclo&s;ing a nail, &s;urrounded by rays of gilt metal, and &s;aid to be one of tho&s;e, by which our Saviour was nailed to the cro&s;s: near it is a kind of machine by which &s;ix per&s;ons may be drawn up to it at once. On the third of May, being the fe&s;tival of the invention of the cro&s;s, this relique is carried about in grand proce&s;&s;ion. The like is al&s;o done on any extraordinary irritations, as a long drought, the plague, and other public cala|mities. It is then carried by the Archbi&s;hop, under a magnificent canopy.</P>
<P>Among other curio&s;ities in this church, there is a very extraordinary one, viz. a piece of Aaron's rod. Some pieces of it, are al&s;o &s;hewn in the palace-church of Hanover, among tho&s;e reliques which Henry, &s;urnamed the Lion, brought from the
<PB N="138" REF="140">
Holy-land; it is al&s;o accompanied with a piece of Mo&s;es's rod.</P>
<P>The pavement is a kind of mo&s;aic, con&s;i&s;ting of pieces of red, black, and white marble, in|laid; &s;o as to repre&s;ent circles, fe&s;toons, flowers, foliage, &amp;c. &s;o that when it is viewed from the cu|pola, it appears like a beautiful carpet. The pave|ment of the choir, is &s;aid to have co&s;t above five thou&s;and crowns. The re&s;t of the pavement is only made of tiles, and tho&s;e laid &s;o uneven, as to be very inconvenient for people to walk upon them.</P>
<P>The Prebendarie &s;talls are made of walnut-tree, on which, all the remarkable actions of the Emperor <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> and <HI>St. Ambro&s;e,</HI> are admirably executed in &s;culpture. Every action is repre&s;ented on a di&s;|tinct compartment, and though numerous, are &s;aid to be the work of one arti&s;t. The canons are di|vided into three cla&s;&s;es, thirty of which, are nobles; and, like the Cardinals, wear a red ve&s;tment; the &s;econd cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of wealthy citizens, who are cloathed in green; and the re&s;t, wear the common habit of the Clergy.</P>
<P>A marble &s;tair-ca&s;e, carried round one of the main pillars, con&s;i&s;ting of 158 &s;teps, leads to the fir&s;t
<PB N="139" REF="141">
outward gallery. Here is a marble &s;tatue of Duke <HI>John Galeazzo Vi&s;conti,</HI> on the top of a pyramid, with a flag in his hand, who, in the year 1386, laid the foundation of this &s;tately edifice. This &s;tatue, though as big as the life, when &s;een from the ground, does not appear to exceed a &s;pan and a half in length. Many &s;tatues of Saints, Dukes, and other eminent per&s;onages, &s;tand round the gallery; &s;everal of the&s;e images are of a gigantic &s;ize, and &s;ome make &s;uch an appearance, that reverence for the per&s;ons repre&s;ented, and a regard to mode&s;ty, has occa&s;ioned them to be placed at this height, in order to &s;et them at a proper di&s;tance from the pub|lic view.</P>
<P>In this church, there are &s;ilver votive offerings, to the weight of &s;ome thou&s;ands of ounces, repre|&s;enting heads, hearts, feet, hands, ears, and other parts of the body, which had been hurt or di&s;ea&s;ed, but &s;uppo&s;ed to be re&s;tored to their &s;trength and &s;oundne&s;s, by the interce&s;&s;ion of St. <HI>Charles Borromeo.</HI> All &s;ilver&s;miths expo&s;e to &s;ale, &s;uch votive pieces, of different &s;izes, ready made, that a recovered patient may immediately pay his vow, le&s;t his gratitude &s;hould cool by any delay.</P>
<P>The body of this Saint, lies on the altar of a &s;ub|terraneous chapel, directly under the main cupola.
<PB N="140" REF="142">
It is dre&s;&s;ed in pontifical robes, and lies in a &s;hrine of cry&s;tal, of almo&s;t ine&s;timable value, within a coffin made of wood. The body is entire, and the face quite perfect, except the tip of the no&s;e, but the &s;kin is of the colour and con&s;i&s;tence of parch|ment; it has a &s;hining appearance, like a burn or &s;cald newly healed; he has &s;ilk gloves on; his portrait is pre&s;erved in a little chapel ju&s;t by; it is done in embroidery by the famous <HI>Peregina,</HI> and exhibits a &s;trong likene&s;s, <HI>to what he is at pre&s;ent.</HI> There is but one key belonging to this chapel, which is kept by the Archbi&s;hop, without who&s;e leave, this venerable relique is not to be &s;een. The walls of the chapel are almo&s;t every where lined with &s;ilver. This is the Saint, who &s;old an e&s;tate for 80,000 dol|lars, all which money he di&s;tributed in one day to the poor. Every &s;eparate compartment of this chapel, is ca&s;ed, &s;ays <HI>Piozzi,</HI> like our old fa&s;hioned watch-ca&s;es, with &s;ome &s;tory from his life. Every year, the immortal <HI>Carlo Borromeo's</HI> actions are rehear&s;ed, and his prai&s;es celebrated by people, appointed in every church, to preach his example and record his excellence.</P>
<P>A &s;ight of the trea&s;ury, co&s;ts about five or &s;ix &s;hillings; it is extremely rich, and contains a prodi|gious number of gold and &s;ilver ve&s;&s;els, &s;tatues, rings, chalices, crucifixes, of which the metal is the lea&s;t

valuable part. Some of the mo&s;t valuable curio&s;i|ties to be &s;een here, are a &s;ilver image of <HI>St. Bor|romeo,</HI> bigger than life, with a diamond crucifix of immen&s;e value, hanging at his brea&s;t. The front of this mitre, which is always put on the decea&s;ed Archbi&s;hop's head, when his body is carried in pro|ce&s;&s;ion, is entirely covered with pearl. The Arch|bi&s;hop, on the&s;e public occa&s;ions, carries a cry&s;tal cup, &s;et in gold, with a &s;apphire of the largene&s;s of a bean, on the top of the cover. Another jewel, con|&s;i&s;ting of a clu&s;ter of gems, with an oriental topaz, of the bigne&s;s of a large walnut in the centre, is worn by the Archbi&s;hop at his bo&s;om. <HI>St. Charles Borromeo's</HI> ring, has in it a &s;apphire of the &s;ize of a hazel-nut, and is ki&s;&s;ed, with great devotion, by all eccle&s;ia&s;tics.</P>
<P>A rich merchant of this city, left be&s;ides his other charitable foundations, 230,000 ducats, to be ex|pended in building the front of the cathedral only, and yet the work is not &s;o much as begun. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to be omitted purpo&s;ely, that per&s;ons of fortune, and of a liberal di&s;po&s;ition, being affected by &s;uch a &s;ight, may be excited to contribute largely, in order to complete the church, and embrace the opportunity of &s;ecuring their eter|nal &s;alvation. Though, as we ob&s;erved before, it is near five centuries &s;ince this church has been
<PB N="142" REF="144">
begun: the whole &s;quare behind it, is filled with workmen, employed in &s;awing, cutting, and poli&s;h|ing the marble. There is an annual income of 18,000 crowns levied till the church &s;hall be com|pleted.</P>
<P>Both here, and in other churches in the Mila|ne&s;e, the entrances are crowded with old women, &s;pinning, or occupied with &s;ome other employment; as they do not beg, they po&s;&s;ibly conceive it to be a work of merit, to &s;pend the whole day, as it were, in the hou&s;e of God. One al&s;o meets here, with wo|men in black veils, a&s;king alms, &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;uch, who, from their rank or circum&s;tances, are not willing to be known; as they beg in public. Formerly, men u&s;ed this di&s;gui&s;e, but, on account of the many abu&s;es they committed, the Archbi&s;hop prohibited that &s;ex the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the cathedral, &s;tands the Archbi&s;hop's palace, a very &s;pacious building, con&s;i&s;ting of two courts. In one of the&s;e, are the &s;tatues of <HI>St. Charles Borromeo,</HI> and <HI>St. Ambro&s;e;</HI> the latter, with an iron rod in his hand, as an emblem of his heroic oppo&s;i|tion to the Emperor <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> in which particular, the Clergy, had they power, do not want the inclina|tion to imitate him.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">The Ambro&s;ian college, which &s;tands near the centre of the city, is a foundation for the &s;everal branches of literature, where youth are in&s;tructed gratis, by 16 profe&s;&s;ors. The city is obliged to Cardinal <HI>F. Borromeo,</HI> nephew to the Saint of that name, for this in&s;titution. The chief thing here, worth a traveller's notice, is the library, which is upon a very exten&s;ive &s;cale. This library, except in vacation time, is open every morning, from ten to twelve, and in the afternoon al&s;o, for two hours: it contains 45,000 printed volumes; which, however, are far le&s;s valuable than its trea&s;ure of manu&s;cripts. In appearance, it does not &s;eem credible, that the latter &s;hould amount to 15,000, as it is pretended; but, that there are &s;ome good pieces among them, is certain. Here is a voluminous work, treating of the affairs of Italy, entitled, <HI>de Scriptoribus Rerum Italicarum,</HI> compiled by the learned <HI>Muraton.</HI> The mo&s;t curious manu&s;cript in the whole library, is a tran&s;lation of <HI>Jo&s;ephus's</HI> Hi&s;tory of the Jews, by <HI>Rufinus,</HI> in folio, it being reputed to be above 1300, or at lea&s;t 1100 years old, and is written on the bark of a tree. Some adjacent rooms, &s;erve for a mu|&s;eum, where, among other curio&s;ities, is the &s;keleton of a woman of great beauty, who directed that her bones &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of in this manner, and under the &s;keleton, are the&s;e words: <HI>Ut aegrotan|tium &s;aluti mortucrum in&s;pectione viventes pro&s;picere
<PB N="144" REF="146">
po&s;&s;int bunc</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">. i. e. This &s;keleton is placed here, that the living, by a view of the dead, may be the better enabled to re&s;tore health to the &s;ick. If this lady, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> only meant to give a proof of the tran&s;ient nature of external charms, and that a beau|tiful woman is not more de&s;irable after death, than a homely one, &s;he might have allowed her body to be con&s;igned to du&s;t in the u&s;ual way. In &s;pite of all the co&s;metics, and other auxiliaries, which vanity employs to varni&s;h and to &s;upport decaying beauty and flaccid charms, the world have been long &s;atis|fied, that death is not nece&s;&s;ary to put the fair and the homely on a level; a very few years, even dur|ing life, do the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t valuable thing, among the whole collection, are 12 large volumes of <HI>Leonardo da Vinci's</HI> manu&s;cripts, con&s;i&s;ting of mathematical and other de&s;igns, which &s;ufficiently manife&s;t the accurate knowledge of that great man in anatomy, optics, geometry, architecture, &s;culpture, and me|chanics; and that in the theory of tho&s;e &s;ciences, he has been equalled by very few. His mechanical de|&s;ignings are exceedingly curious, and con&s;i&s;t of 399 leaves, containing 1750 original de&s;igns. The notes are written in very &s;mall hand, and from the right to the left; &s;o that they cannot be ea&s;ily read, without a magnifying &s;peculum, and on this account, there is
<PB N="145" REF="147">
one always at hand. For this one volume, <HI>James</HI> I. King of England, is &s;aid to have commi&s;&s;ioned the Earl of Arundel, to offer 3000 pi&s;toles to the per|&s;on in who&s;e hands it then was; but he rather cho&s;e to make a pre&s;ent of it to the Ambro&s;ian college, that this part of his works might not be &s;e|parated from the re&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Leonardo</HI> had his &s;urname of <HI>Vinci,</HI> from a ca&s;tle of that name, &s;ituated near Florence. He died at Fountainbleau, in 1520, in the 75th year of his age, with this honorable circum&s;tance, that he expired in the arms of <HI>Francis</HI> the I&s;t. who had conde&s;cended to vi&s;it him in his la&s;t illne&s;s.</P>
<P>In this library, are al&s;o volumes of de&s;igns by other ma&s;ters, &s;uch as <HI>Raphael, Michael Angelo, Andrea del Sarto, Corregio, Parme&s;ano,</HI> and &s;everal books of painted birds and flowers.</P>
<P>Over the great door of the refectory, in the Do|minican convent, is the Lord's &s;upper, painted by <HI>Leonardo da Vinci,</HI> but with too many marks of the injuries of time. The &s;tory of <HI>Vinci's</HI> revenge on the haughty Prior, who was ince&s;&s;antly teazing him to di&s;patch the picture, in painting the traitor <HI>Judas</HI> in <HI>his</HI> likene&s;s, may, with other particulars, be read at large, in <HI>Va&s;ari's</HI> Lives of the Painters.</P>

But Antiquarians are not a little divided about their number, &s;ome affirming them to have been 12, others 14, and <HI>Epi|phanius,</HI> 15. Their three-fold offering was no proof of their being but three in number; gold, and myrrh, and frankincen&s;e, being the mo&s;t valuable produce of their country, and what the Queen of
<PB N="147" REF="149">
Sheba brought <HI>Solomon,</HI> as the mo&s;t honorable pre|&s;ent &s;he could make that monarch. The more mo|dern writers, agreeable to the opinion of <HI>Pope Leo the Great,</HI> limit the number of the ea&s;tern <HI>Magi</HI> to three; but venerable <HI>Bede</HI> is the fir&s;t who brought to light their names, viz. <HI>Ca&s;par, Melchior,</HI> and <HI>Baltha&s;ar:</HI> and it is a &s;uper&s;titious notion of &s;ome &s;tanding, that the following di&s;tich, written on a &s;lip of paper, and carried about the patient, is an infallible pre&s;ervative again&s;t epilep&s;ies:

<P>Near the Porta Orientale, is the &s;pacious Lazaretto, belonging to the great ho&s;pital; the area is let out to poor people, who maintain them&s;elves by culti|vating
<PB N="148" REF="150">
gardens and vineyards; and this is the only thing worth &s;eeing in it. The 360 chambers round the quadrangle, are quite empty and out of repair. The whole building is of &s;tone, and every cell has a window towards the country, and another towards the gardens in the middle of the Lagaretto, and its particular chimney and privy. On the out&s;ide of the&s;e cells, runs a piazza, with marble pillars. In the time of a pe&s;tilence, or epidemic di&s;tem|per, foreigners are expelled out of the country, and the infected &s;ubjects brought hither. The compa&s;s of ground inclo&s;ed in the Lazaretto, may be con|ceived from the length of one of its &s;ides, which is 600 paces. Another great convenience here is, that a &s;wift &s;tream is made to run along under the whole quadrangle, and thus carries off all the filth. Facing the entrance, is a marble pillar, with a hole, repre&s;enting a broken plague-&s;ore in the fle&s;h; within, it appears fre&s;h and bloody, and without, yellow and purulent, and is &s;aid to ari&s;e from a miracle of <HI>St. Charles Borromeo,</HI> who once exor|ci&s;ed the plague into this pillar.</P>
<P>As to ho&s;pitals, <HI>Lazaretti,</HI> and other charitable foundations, prote&s;tant countries can by no means come in competition with tho&s;e of the Romi&s;h per|&s;ua&s;ion. However, at Leyden there is &s;till a pe&s;t-hou&s;e kept up, with 250 beds always in readine&s;s,
<PB N="149" REF="151">
and, upon occa&s;ion, capable of receiving 900 pa|tients. Nothing can exceed the cleanline&s;s and de|cency ob&s;erved there, with this exception only, that every patient has not a particular room, but 20, or more lie in one ward; which, in a contagious di&s;tem|per, cannot but be attended with bad con&s;equences. From this dreadful &s;courge, Leyden has been free ever &s;ince 1667, and Milan &s;ince the year 1630; and it is to be hoped that, by the precautions lately introduced, the u&s;e of more healthy and nutritive aliments, greater cleanline&s;s in apparel and linen, &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of hou&s;es, and breadth of &s;treets, for freer pa&s;&s;age of the air, that Europe will no more be &s;ubject to &s;uch pe&s;tilential ravages, as in the days of our ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>During the la&s;t plague at Milan &s;ome villains were found of &s;uch execrable barbarity, as to increa&s;e the contagion by poi&s;onous ointments, which they threw in the &s;treets, or &s;meared about in &s;everal parts of the city. However their abominable guilt was not long concealed, and two of the ring-leaders, a Barber, and the Commi&s;&s;ary of Health, were puni&s;h|ed with proper rigour and &s;everity; as appears by an in&s;cription on a pillar erected where the Barber's hou&s;e &s;tood, which is called <HI>Colonna infame.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152">The purport of the in&s;cription, which is in Latin, is, that in this open area formerly &s;tood the &s;hop of <HI>John James Mora,</HI> who, together with <HI>William Platea,</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ary of Health, and others, whil&s;t the city was afflicted with a dreadful pe&s;tilence, &s;pread about poi&s;onous ointments, by which many died in a deplorable manner. Being by the Senate declared enemies to their country, they were fir&s;t &s;entenced to be torn in pieces with red hot pincers, and to have their right hands cut off, then to be broke upon the wheel, and to lie &s;ix hours tied down to the &s;ame; after which their throats to be cut, and their bodies to be burned to a&s;hes; and, that no|thing might remain of &s;uch execrable villains, their goods to be confi&s;cated, and their a&s;hes to be thrown into the river; and, that for the perpetual com|memoration of their guilt and puni&s;hment, the hou&s;e, where this horrid fact was concerted, was or|dered to be levelled to the ground, and never to be rebuilt, and a pillar to be erected on the &s;pot, called the Infamous Column. Approach not this place good citizens, is farther in&s;cribed upon it, fly far away; le&s;t ye be polluted by this infamous and exe|crable &s;pot.</P>
<P>In one of the convents belonging to the Domini|cans, the tribunal of the Inqui&s;ition is held; the &s;e|verities of which are exerci&s;ed chiefly again&s;t the
<PB N="151" REF="153">
Jewi&s;h religion, and no one of that profe&s;&s;ion mu&s;t come into the city without fir&s;t making his appear|ance before this tribunal. The court of Inqui&s;ition at Milan, be&s;ides eccle&s;ia&s;tics, con&s;i&s;ts of 60 noble|ment, and 150 reputable merchants. They, who&s;e misfortune it is to fall into their hands, never know the informer, nor on what account they are impri&s;oned; and from tho&s;e nau&s;eous cells in which they are confined, and other &s;hocking hard&s;hips, there is no deliverance but by becoming their own accu&s;ers.</P>
<P>A prie&s;t, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> previous to his vi&s;iting this city, underwent a &s;evere puni&s;hment merely for celebrating ma&s;s before he received his bull of ordina|tion. It was in vain for him to plead that the Pope's bull was on the road from Rome; and the intere&s;t of his relations, who were per&s;ons of &s;ome note, was to as little purpo&s;e. A &s;caffold being erected before the church where the crime had been committed, he was &s;entenced fir&s;t to read ma&s;s; and as &s;oon as he began, the fir&s;t leaf was immediately torn out, after which his canonical robes were pulled off. He was then delivered over to the civil magi&s;trate, by who&s;e order, the thumbs, with the fore and mid|dle fingers of both his hands, between which, at the elevation, he held the ho&s;t, being fir&s;t burnt to a coal, he was hanged. This &s;everity is ea&s;ily
<PB N="152" REF="154">
accounted for from the dignity a&s;&s;umed by the prie&s;thood, and the great importance to the Pope, that none intrude them&s;elves into that office with|out being properly ordained. It is a po&s;ition of <HI>Ho&s;tien&s;is</HI> that the &s;acerdotal office, is 7644 times above the regal, that being the proportion of mag|nitude between the &s;un and the moon. In the eye of the canon law the prerogative of the crown is as much inferior to that of the mitre, as lead is to gold. But <HI>Alanus de Rupe,</HI> in his Treati&s;e on the Dignity of the Prie&s;thood, takes a higher flight, and &s;cruples not to rai&s;e the power of the prie&s;t above that of God him&s;elf, alledging that God &s;pent a whole week in creating the world, and di&s;po&s;ing it into proper form; whereas a prie&s;t, every time he &s;ays ma&s;s with a word or two, produces not a mere creature, but the &s;upreme uncreated Being him&s;elf the origin of all things. <HI>Le Gendre,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of France, relating that Louis XI wi&s;hing that he was as happy as the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> who carried our Saviour in her womb; the Pope gave that monarch to under&s;tand, that the prie&s;tly office is &s;till more ho|nourable; in&s;omuch that a prie&s;t may daily, or oft|ner, carry the body of Chri&s;t in his hand.</P>

<P>The great ho&s;pital, founded by Duke <HI>Franci&s;co Sfortia,</HI> is a noble building, perhaps the fir&s;t in the world of it's kind. The middle court of this ho&s;pital is &s;urrounded by a piazza, which con&s;i&s;ts of 80 arches, &s;upported by marble pillars. Each &s;ide of this court, which is &s;quare, is 250 feet in length, and has three galleries: be&s;ides this large court, there are eight &s;mal|ler. The number of wards for the &s;ick and wounded, are 24, who are di&s;tributed into proper wards, ac|cording to their different di&s;ea&s;es. The con&s;ump|tive patients have their particular ward, another is appointed for fevers, a third for the &s;mall pox, a fourth for the wounded, a fifth for the venereal di&s;|ea&s;e, &amp;c. There are generally about 400 patients in the fever-ward. Though this ward is very lofty in re&s;pect of the others, and all po&s;&s;ible care is taken for the free pa&s;&s;age of air, to keep it &s;weet and cle$$, yet amid&s;t &s;uch numbers of patients, it is impo&s;&s;ible to prevent an offen&s;ive &s;mell. The &s;ight of &s;ome hundreds, lying in a fever, mu&s;t every where be di&s;agreeable, but e&s;pecially here, where the black hair of the Italians adds to the gha&s;tline&s;s of their &s;allow, meagre vi&s;ages.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="156">In the admi&s;&s;ion of expo&s;ed foundlings, or of &s;ick and wounded, no regard is paid to country or reli|gion. The Prote&s;tants lie in the &s;ame wards with other patients, but at the other end; and when the Ho&s;t is elevated, or carried about, a curtain is drawn between them and the re&s;t. Thus, by a very commendable and humane indulgence, the adora|tion of the Ho&s;t is di&s;pen&s;ed with, and the con&s;cience is free from all compul&s;ion; nor are &s;trangers obliged to kneel on meeting the Ho&s;t, either in the churches or &s;treets.</P>
<P>The wounded are brought into this ho&s;pital by a particular door, which is kept open all night for that purpo&s;e; but other patients are admitted only in the day-time. This is a regulation, which if the Governors of our Ho&s;pitals in England, were to adopt, it would redound more to their cre|dit and humanity. We have the conceit to imagine, that we are the mo&s;t charitable nation on the face of the earth; whereas, an attentive in&s;ight into the manners and cu&s;toms of other nations, will &s;hew that there are few, who do not exceed us, in their bene|volent in&s;titutions, for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e foundations are under the continual in|&s;pection of 19 of the principal nobility; one of the&s;e
<PB N="155" REF="157">
governors mu&s;t attend every morning, in his turn, to enquire into the management of the ho&s;pital, and vi&s;it all the wards; a&s;king the patients, one by one, whether they are well treated, and upon the lea&s;t ju&s;t complaint again&s;t any officer, he is immediately removed. The vi&s;itor al&s;o enquires if any thing be wanting, and whether any wounded patients have been received into the ho&s;pital, the preceding night; and every morning, an account of their admittance and condition, is drawn up by a Notary. To this ho&s;pital belong nine Phy&s;icians and four Surgeons, who all vi&s;it the patients three times a day, and admini&s;ter medicines to the &s;ick; the Surgeons indeed live in the ho&s;pital. The di&s;pen&s;ary it&s;elf takes up a very large hall, where every afternoon the medicines are made up for the u&s;e of the following day. The pre&s;criptions are regularly entered in a day-book, and, for preventing any accident or mi&s;|take among &s;uch a variety of different medicines, every do&s;e is marked with the number of the bed, and the name of the patient for whom it is de&s;igned.</P>
<P>The plai&s;ters are made and &s;pread, in a particu|lar apartment: to this ho&s;pital al&s;o belongs a very good phy&s;ic-garden. For carrying off the filth, a canal or &s;ink runs under every part of this edifice, and all the trade&s;men employed by the ho&s;pital, live within its walls, as the baker, butcher, weaver,

taylor, &s;emp&s;tre&s;s, and &s;everal others who have their re&s;pective &s;hops; &s;o that this ho&s;pital is as it were a little city, or republic within it&s;elf, having very little connexion with Milan. In the meadows be|longing to this ho&s;pital, are kept bullocks, &s;heep, &amp;c. and by computation between 5 and 600 weight of butchers meat is daily con&s;umed here, be&s;ides other eatables.</P>
<P>The number of patients generally exceeds 1500: the females are di&s;tributed into nine particular wards; the officers and &s;ervants, of all ranks, in this ho&s;pital, are reckoned to be 500. At the charge of the ho&s;|pital, but at another place, are likewi&s;e maintained 300 idiots and lunatics, and al&s;o above 5000 found|lings. Some of the&s;e la&s;t are kept in the country, and others in the city, where they are brought up to handicraft trades. None but women of very good character are admitted as wet-nur&s;es to the&s;e chil|dren. Two hours after &s;un-&s;et, at the main entrance of the ho&s;pital, a kind of wicket is opened, within which is a copper machine, in the &s;hape of an oven, which turns on an axis, and is large enough to con|tain a child of &s;even or eight years old. The ma|chine has a large aperture, which at night is turned towards the &s;treet; and mothers, who have been lately delivered, and are unable to bring up their children, &s;end them here. The child being put
<PB N="157" REF="159">
into the machine, the per&s;on who brings it, turns it about, knocks at the gate and makes off; then the porter, who always &s;its up in the room, to which the open &s;ide of the machine is turned, receives the infant, and &s;ends it to one of the nur&s;es. Every &s;uch foundling is bapti&s;ed, unle&s;s a note be left to &s;ignify that it has been done already. Formerly, unnatural or di&s;tre&s;&s;ed parents u&s;ed to lay down the infants at the gate, through which the wounded patients were conveyed in the night; &s;o that often the poor children were deprived of their limbs, and &s;ometimes lo&s;t their lives by &s;ome accident before they were found, and taken in. Four or five children are often brought to the ho&s;pital in one night, and &s;eldom le&s;s than three. The apartments of the wet-nur&s;es, and of all the other women be|longing to the ho&s;pital, are &s;o contrived that no men can come among them, unle&s;s in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e inve&s;ted with &s;ome authority. The wet-nur&s;es, when either the weakne&s;s or illne&s;s of the infants requires them to remain in the ho&s;pital, are allowed a bed-chamber, another for feeding the children, and a third for wa&s;hing them. What in&s;titution in England have we to vie with this? None. In Ireland there is &s;omething &s;imilar to it, where numbers of children from the Welch and Lanca&s;hire coa&s;ts are daily &s;ent to be educated and brought up; and yet how much more con&s;equential
<PB N="158" REF="160">
do we conceive our&s;elves, than either the Milane&s;e or the Iri&s;h.</P>
<P>The certain yearly income of this ho&s;pital amounts to 90 or 100,000 crowns. No country in the world, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> equals Italy in the care of the poor and &s;ick; and if there be any fault in this particular, it is, perhaps, the want of due qualifi|cations in the phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons.</P>
<P><HI>La Charit&eacute;,</HI> and that famous ho&s;pital in Paris, <HI>l'Hotel Dieu,</HI> &s;ays the above author, receive indeed a great number of patients, but nothing of the re|gularity and cleanline&s;s of the Italian ho&s;pitals is to be &s;een there. Only the lower wards of the latter ho&s;pital have &s;ingle beds for each patient, and the&s;e but few in number, and are paid for; mo&s;t of the other beds are for two per&s;ons, who al&s;o lie one at the head and the other at the feet; and in many of the beds four patients lie in the &s;ame man|ner. In &s;uch a &s;ituation it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that &s;ome patients who are on the mending hand, may be obliged to lie &s;everal hours with others who are in the agonies of death; and it is no very un|common ca&s;e for the dead to lie an hour or longer among the living, e&s;pecially if it &s;hould happen that the patient dies after ten o'clock at night.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="161">Be&s;ides, the great ho&s;pital are &s;everal other foun|dations for the &s;ick and poor. <HI>La Charit&eacute;</HI> is a large building for the &s;upport of 200 orphans. <HI>St. Vincentis</HI> ho&s;pital for lunatics, has &s;eldom le&s;s than 200 patients. In that of <HI>St. Cel&s;us</HI> &s;ome hun|dreds of foundlings are provided for; and in <HI>St. Ambro&s;e's</HI> ho&s;pital, aged per&s;ons, who are pa&s;t their labour, are comfortably maintained. The <HI>Broglio</HI> ho&s;pital is the receptacle for &s;uch patients as are infected with venereal complaints, which in Italy are not only more frequent, but more &s;hock|ing and terrible in their con&s;equences than in other countries.</P>
<P><HI>St. Stephen's</HI> Church is built on the &s;pot where the fir&s;t battle again&s;t the Arians is &s;aid to have been fought, with this addition, that <HI>St. Ambro&s;e,</HI> being at a lo&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h the dead bodies of the orthodox from the heretics, ordered the latter to lie with their faces downwards to the earth, and the former to look up towards Heaven, which was immediately done. It is further related that the blood of the faithful, gathering together, conglo|merated into the form of a wheel, until it was to|tally ab&s;orbed by a hollow &s;tone, over which a bra&s;s plate is placed on the ground; and oppo&s;ite to it is a pillar with the figure of a wheel, and an in&s;crip|tion cut upon it in Latin, &s;ignifying that this wheel

was &s;et up as a memorial of a mo&s;t bloody battle, fought between the Catholics and the Arians, when <HI>St. Ambro&s;e</HI> was Bi&s;hop of Milan; by the preva|lency of who&s;e prayers the blood of the orthodox that were &s;lain, which ran promi&s;cuou&s;ly with the blood of the heretics, immediately coagulated in the form of a wheel, (&s;eparating what was &s;acred from the profane,) which gave the name of <HI>La Rota</HI> to this church, a name it &s;till retains with that of <HI>St. Stephen's.</HI> The in&s;cription further remarks, that the hollow &s;tone, which lies oppo&s;ite the wheel, ab&s;orbed the blood of the &s;aints, which miraculou&s;ly flowed to this place, and reque&s;ting the reader to adore the traces of this miracle and reverence its memory.</P>

<P>There is no place in Italy, remarks <HI>Moore,</HI> (he adds, I perhaps might have &s;aid in Europe,) where &s;trangers are received in &s;uch an ea&s;y, ho&s;pitable manner, as at Milan. Formerly the Milane&s;e no|bility di&s;played a degree of &s;plendour and muni|ficence, not only in their entertainments, but in their u&s;ual &s;tile of living, unknown in any other country in Europe. They are under a nece&s;&s;ity at pre&s;ent, of living at le&s;s expence; but they &s;till &s;hew the &s;ame obliging and ho&s;pitable di&s;po&s;ition.

<PB N="164" REF="166">
part of Italy; and nice ob&s;ervers imagine they per|ceive in Milane&s;e manners, the politene&s;s, formality, and hone&s;ty imputed to the&s;e three nations, blended with the ingenuou&s;ne&s;s natural to the Italians. The company a&s;&s;embles every evening in their car|riages on the ramparts, and drive about in the &s;ame manner as in the other cities of Italy, till it is pretty late. In Italy the ladies have no notion of quit|ting their carriages, and u&s;ing their legs as in Eng|land and France. On &s;eeing the number of &s;er|vants, and the &s;plendour of the equipages, which appear every evening at the Cor&s;o on the ramparts, one would not &s;u&s;pect the degree of depopulation and diminution of wealth, which we are a&s;&s;ured has taken place within the&s;e few years all over the Milane&s;e; and which is &s;aid, to proceed from the burthen&s;ome nature of &s;ome late taxes, and the in&s;olent and oppre&s;&s;ive manner in which they are gathered.</P>
<P><HI>Key&s;ler</HI> remarks that the vici&s;&s;itudes this &s;tate has undergone, have introduced a much more &s;ocial and free way of living than in the South parts of Italy; to this the fertility of the country, and wealth of the nobility, do not a little contribute. The ladies can hardly be under le&s;s re&s;traint, even in France, than they are here. During the carnival, women of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion are accu&s;tomed
<PB N="165" REF="167">
to give magnificent entertainments, even at public taverns; to avoid the inconvenience and charges, with which &s;uch entertainments would be attend|ed at their own hou&s;es. Their hu&s;bands &s;eem per|fectly ea&s;y, with regard to their fe&s;tivities, either from pu&s;illanimity or a confidence in their virtue and di&s;cretion; and &s;ome are &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately fond of their wives, as to grudge nothing that may con|tribute to their &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The woman of the lower cla&s;s, imitate their bet|ters as near as they can, and indulge them&s;elves in liberties, which in other parts of Italy are denied them; here al&s;o, as in Paris, trade is mo&s;tly ma|naged by women, who amu&s;e them&s;elves with &s;ewing or embroidering; and the &s;hops, though they are quite open, while the &s;ea&s;on permits, are the places of rendezvous, for a great deal of company. Even in convents the au&s;terities of a mona&s;tic life are &s;o far relaxed, that a traveller may not only talk, rally, and laugh with the nuns at the grate, but join in a concert with them, and &s;pend a whole, afternoon in the&s;e familiarities.</P>
<P>The Lombards po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;kill to plea&s;e, with|out feigning; and, &s;o artle&s;s are their manners, they cannot even be &s;u&s;pected of in&s;incerity. They have, perhaps, for that very rea&s;on, few comedies
<PB N="166" REF="168">
and fewer novels among them; for the wor&s;t of every man's character is already known to the re&s;t; but be his conduct what it will, the heart is com|monly right enough, <HI>il buon cuor Lombardo,</HI> is famed throughout Italy, and nothing can become pro|verbial, without an excellent rea&s;on. Little oppor|tunity is therefore given to writers who carry the dark lanthorn of life into its deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es&mdash;un|veil the hidden wickedne&s;s of a <HI>Ma&s;kwell</HI> or a <HI>Monkton</HI>&mdash;develope the folds of vice, and &s;py out the internal worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of apparent virtue; which from the&s;e di&s;cerning eyes cannot be cloaked, even by that early taught affectation, which renders it a real ingenuity, to di&s;cover, if in a highly poli&s;hed capital, a man or woman has or has not good parts or principles; &s;o completely are the fir&s;t overlaid with literature, and the la&s;t perverted by refine|ment.</P>
<P>No hou&s;e-account, no weekly bills perplex the peace of a Milane&s;e lady of fa&s;hion. If eight &s;ervants are kept, &s;uppo&s;e &s;ix of the&s;e men, (and two of them out of livery,) the pay of the&s;e principal figures in the family when, at the highe&s;t rate, is fifteen pence Engli&s;h a day, out of which they find cloaths, and eating. The dinners dre&s;t at home, are, for this rea&s;on, more exactly contrived than in England, to &s;uit the number of gue&s;ts,
<PB N="167" REF="169">
and there are always half a dozen; for dining alone, or the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>t&eacute;te-a-t&eacute;te,</HI> as we do, is unknown to them, who make &s;ociety very ea&s;y, and re&s;olve to live much together. No odd &s;en&s;ation then, &s;omething like &s;hame, &s;uch as we feel when too many di&s;hes are taken empty from table, touches them at all; the common cour&s;es are 11, and a 11 &s;mall plates, and it is their &s;port and plea&s;ure, if po&s;&s;ible, to clear all away. A foot|man's wages is a &s;hilling a day, like our common labourers, and paid him, as they are paid, every Saturday night. His livery in the mean time, changed twice a year, makes him as rich a man as the butler or valet, but when evening comes, it is the mo&s;t comical &s;ight in the world, to &s;ee them all go gravely home, and a per&s;on may die in the night for want of help, though &s;urrounded by &s;howy attendants all day. Till the hour of depar|ture it is expected that two or three of them at lea&s;t, &s;it in the anti-chamber to an&s;wer the bell, which is no flight &s;ervice, or hard&s;hip; for the &s;tairs, high and wide as tho&s;e of Wind&s;or palace, run up from the door immediately to that apartment, which is very large and very cold, with bricks only to &s;et their feet on, and a brazier filled with warm wood a&s;hes, to keep their fingers from freezing.

<P>Though family connexions are prized very highly here, no man &s;eems a&s;hamed that he has no family to boa&s;t: all &s;eigning indeed would be u&s;ele&s;s and im|practicable; yet it &s;trikes one with a&s;toni&s;hment to hear a well-bred clergyman &s;ay, gravely to his friend, and that friend eminent both for talent and for|tune,

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIX.</HI> Commerce, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MILAN is to this day the centre of a com|merce requiring large capitals, and which &s;ome of the wealthie&s;t hou&s;es have engro&s;&s;ed as a
<PB N="151" REF="179">
clande&s;tine company. Its principal article is raw &s;ilk. The company fore&s;talls this at the time of the crop, from cottage to cottage, and &s;ometimes before. Private hou&s;es carrying on this trade, in|dependent of the company, find it to their advan|tage to &s;ell their &s;ilk according to the price regu|lated by the company. All competition being thus qua&s;hed and ruined, and the &s;ilk-cultivator, obliged to accept what price the buyers fix, turns his indu&s;|try to more profitable objects: in&s;tead therefore of new plantations and new improvements, the old are neglected and run to ruin.</P>
<P>The chief of the Milan manufactures are gold and &s;ilver laces, embroideries in gold and &s;ilver, tin&s;el and thread laces, the&s;e are chiefly kept up by the Italian &s;obriety, the low price of provi&s;ions, and con&s;equently the low price of work.</P>
<P>This city al&s;o vends a prodigious quantity of &s;ilk handkerchiefs, excellently manufactured; and by the Italians accounted an approved amulet again&s;t &s;ore throats, which from the moi&s;tne&s;s of the air are very common in Lombardy. The&s;e handkerchiefs are part of the di&s;habille of the princes and noble|men; but the trading or lower people are never without them at home or abroad. In the &s;ummer|time they have them waving on their &s;houlders,
<PB N="152" REF="180">
and u&s;e them to wipe the &s;weat from their faces; but in the morning and evening they take them in, and tie them very clo&s;e and carefully round their necks.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a large manufacture of cry&s;tal, which is found, with great ri&s;que, in the Alps, and is made into &s;nuff-boxes, lu&s;tres, looking-gla&s;&s;es, &amp;c. The large&s;t looking-gla&s;s that was ever made of one piece of cry&s;tal, is a foot in breadth, and a foot and an half in length. At Milan al&s;o, as at Bologna and Verona, mo&s;t curious artificial flowers are made of paper, wax, feathers, cotton, &s;turgeons &s;kin, exactly re&s;embling nature, and in this art the nuns particularly excel.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable that in this large city gun-pow|der is &s;old only in one place, and by one per&s;on.</P>
<P>The cu&s;toms and duties are no where on &s;o bad a footing as at Milan; a &s;mall gratuity to the of|ficers who importunately a&s;k it, puts an end to all farther &s;earch and que&s;tions; whereas, in Piedmont the extreme &s;everity on this head often puts travel|lers to a great deal of unnece&s;&s;ary delay and trouble.</P>
<P>Milan being by its &s;ituation the natural &s;taple of Switzerland, part of Germany, France, and
<PB N="153" REF="181">
Italy, the di&s;tribution of all the goods to be con|veyed from one of the&s;e countries into another, makes a &s;econdary branch of bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;everal hou&s;es. All goods going from France and Switzer|land are carried on mules; and what is &s;ent from Milan into the internal parts of Italy goes by water. The mo&s;t valuable goods are carried in chai&s;es or cambiaturas, the&s;e carriages are of &s;uch con&s;truc|tion, and hung &s;o that they carry a great deal be|hind, without any inconvenience to the hor&s;es. The waggoners, who &s;warm on the great roads of France, are in Italy employed only in carrying the baggage of the cardinals, or other great men, who have occa&s;ion to pa&s;s through the country. The many charges attending any kind of tran&s;portation con&s;titutes the riches of the Milan brokers; and their intere&s;t being likely to be affected by it, is the chief ob&s;tacle to the &s;etting up of waggons in Italy; the danger of the roads is the pretended ob|&s;tacle; but why &s;hould roads be more dangerous for five or &s;ix waggoners travelling in company than for as many chai&s;es?</P>
<P>Another branch of trade is the furni&s;hing travel|lers with carriages, and this city lays mo&s;t of them, even the mo&s;t cautious, more or le&s;s under contri|bution; they are told that only cro&s;&s;ing the Alps ruins a carriage, that the French po&s;t-chai&s;es,
<PB N="154" REF="182">
either in winter or &s;ummer, will not do for the roads of Italy, and that they require a chai&s;e &s;o contrived as to be taken to pieces and put together in an in&s;tant, and by any per&s;ons; now the Milan carriages, be&s;ides tho&s;e conveniences, are both light and &s;trong, the wood and leather of a good quality, together with the advantage of carrying a great deal without overloading the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the produce of the rice-grounds, in the Milane&s;e, is very con&s;iderable. The rice grows in fields all under water, which ri&s;es with the plant, &s;o that during the whole time of its growth only the top appears above water. The numberle&s;s ca|nals which inter&s;ect Lombardy, induce the landed men to this culture, which indeed has been carried &s;o far that all the Milane&s;e is like to become one rice-ground, that is one continual fen; unle&s;s go|vernment puts &s;ome limitation to this culture; ex|perience having &s;hewn the noxious effects of the air from rice-grounds, and which daily become more noxious from their va&s;t increa&s;e. Even in times when the&s;e grounds were but thinly &s;cattered, the villages, which lay north or ea&s;t of them, were every year vi&s;ited with &s;ome contagious di&s;ea&s;e; and the greater part of the pea&s;ants employed in this culture become drop&s;ical, and die before they reach forty.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="183">The regular forces now in this duchy amounts to eighteen thou&s;and men, the greate&s;t part of who&s;e cloathing, arms, and other nece&s;&s;aries, come from Germany, to the no &s;mall di&s;content of the Mila|ne&s;e, who think it hard that as the money for the payment of the&s;e troops is rai&s;ed among them, it &s;hould not again be laid out and circulated in their country.</P>
<P>The city council is compo&s;ed of a pre&s;ident and &s;ixty members, all nobles, and independent of the Governor. The Spaniards are &s;aid, in peaceable times, to have rai&s;ed two millions of dollars in the Milane&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Milane&s;e territories ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered by the Roman law, with &s;ome modification of cu&s;|toms and &s;tatutes. Mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;tatutes are of the reign of the good King <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. who&s;e name they accordingly bear. The&s;e &s;tatutes in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion have e&s;tabli&s;hed the law of equality, which the no|bility it&s;elf can elude only by entails, or the acqui|&s;ition of lands in countries, where this law is not in force.</P>
<P>Since Milan has been governed only by a &s;econ|dary authority, ju&s;tice has lo&s;t much of that vigour, which the &s;overeigns pre&s;ence generally &s;ecures to
<PB N="156" REF="184">
it. De&s;pair, and oftentimes an impo&s;&s;ibility of ob|taining it, puts people on doing them&s;elves ju&s;tice. The magi&s;trate winks at the effects of private ven|geance, and confines him&s;elf to the prohibition of <HI>&s;tillettos</HI> and pocket-pi&s;tols. The di&s;patch and impartiality in which ju&s;tice is rendered in France, and the northern &s;tates, remove all apprehen&s;ions from &s;uch weapons, which in any country where ju&s;tice &s;hall become venal, tedious or expen&s;ive, would be as common as in Italy.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XX.</HI> The Duchy of Mantua.</HEAD>
<P>THIS duchy, encompa&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e of Milan and Modena, the territories of the Pope and the Venetians, is not more than between 50 and 60 miles in extent, and about 40 in breadth.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="185">It formerly had dukes of its own, but &s;ince the commencement of this century, the Imperiali&s;ts over-run the whole duchy, which has ever &s;ince been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and is at pre&s;ent annexed to the Milane&s;e government.</P>
<P>This duchy abounds in corn, fruit, flax, &s;ilk, and cattle. The &s;oil is extremely fertile, but its depth and &s;oftne&s;s occa&s;ions the roads to be almo&s;t im|pa&s;&s;able in winter. In &s;ummer the verdure of the fields and meadows, divided by beautiful rows of trees, with abundances of vines twining round the trunks and branches, renders travelling delightful. The great number of nightingales that frequent this tract of land by their plaintive warblings, makes the charming &s;cene &s;till more enchanting. Indeed, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> a per&s;on who makes any &s;tay in Italy is &s;o accu&s;tomed to fine pro&s;pects and enchanting land-&s;capes, that in time they grow familiar to the eye, and are le&s;s regarded than when they fir&s;t pre|&s;ented them&s;elves to view.</P>
<P>Mantua, the capital of the duchy, lies on a lake formed by the inundation of the Mincio, which is 20 miles in circumference, and two broad. The two chief bridges leading to this city are defended by citadels, with fortifications at both ends. The city is divided by the water into two almo&s;t equal
<PB N="158" REF="186">
parts, having a communication with each other over &s;ix bridges, and is about four miles in circum|ference. In the heat of &s;ummer, when the lake is low and &s;tagnate, the air becomes &s;o noxious that the better &s;ort of inhabitants retire into the country. The greater part of the &s;treets are long, broad, and &s;trait, with hand&s;ome &s;tone hou&s;es, and &s;tately churches. The population is e&s;timated only at 20,000. Seven thou&s;and Jews occupy a third part of the city, have a &s;ynogogue, and live after their own fa&s;hion. The population was formerly com|puted at 50,000, exclu&s;ive of the garri&s;on; but &s;ince there has been no court kept here, the number of inhabitants has been gradually decrea&s;ing. What contributes mo&s;t to keep the city alive at pre&s;ent, is its annual fair, which is very much re&s;orted to. The theatres are very beautiful, and the &s;mall one e&s;pecially is on an elegant plan.</P>
<P>There are 18 pari&s;h churches at Mantua, and 14 convents. The cathedral is &s;pacious, and has five ai&s;les. <HI>Guilio Romano</HI> was the architect, and al&s;o painted the tribuna, with a part of the ceiling. In the upper &s;acri&s;ty is a night-piece of the temptation of S. <HI>Antony,</HI> by <HI>Paola Verone&s;e.</HI> The church of S. <HI>Antony</HI> is more famous for relics than any in Mantua; a con&s;iderable portion, as is pretended, of the blood of Chri&s;t, being kept in a &s;ubterra|neous
<PB N="159" REF="187">
chapel, and once every year &s;hewn to the people.</P>
<P>The ducal gallery and mu&s;eum, formerly &s;o fa|mous, was pillaged by the &s;oldiers, when the Im|periali&s;ts took the city, by &s;torm. At that time a common &s;oldier was &s;o lucky as to get a booty of 80,000 ducats; but &s;o bad an economi&s;t as to game it all away in one night, for which <HI>Colalto,</HI> the Im|perial general, hanged him the next day. Some apartments in the ca&s;tle are &s;till worth &s;eeing, the ceiling being painted, by <HI>J. Guilio Romano.</HI></P>
<P>Mantua is an epi&s;copal &s;ee, immediately depen|dent on the Pope. The &s;ilk and other manufactures, with its general commerce, formerly &s;o flouri&s;hing, &s;ays <HI>Bu&s;ching,</HI> are now but incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>About two miles from this city is <HI>La Virgiliana,</HI> a ducal manor-hou&s;e, &s;o called from the grotto where <HI>Virgil</HI> is &s;aid to have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tudious hours of his youthful days.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXI.</HI> The Duchies of Parma and Placentia.</HEAD>
<P>THESE have always been united. To the north and the we&s;t they terminate on the Milane&s;e, to the &s;outh on the Genoe&s;e territories; and to the ca&s;t on the Duchy of Modena. They are between 50 and 60 miles in length, and nearly as much in breadth.</P>
<P>The &s;oil is exceedingly fertile, e&s;pecially in the production of olive-trees, large trufles, and che&s;|nuts. The pa&s;tures and cattle are al&s;o very fine particularly about Placentia, where the meadows can be laid under water from a &s;mall river, with a &s;limy water which fertilizes the ground. The cele|brated Parme&s;an chee&s;e is no longer made in this country; but rather at Lode, Bologna, and &s;ome other parts. The two principal cities in the&s;e tetri|tories are Parma and Placentia.</P>
<P>Parma is a large populous city, with &s;pacious &s;treets, and a great number of hand&s;ome hou&s;es,
<PB N="161" REF="189">
which the Italians dignify, according to cu&s;tom, with the name of palaces. The little river, Parma, which falls into the Po, a few miles below the city, divides it into two parts, communicating with each other by three &s;tone bridges. Its circuit is about four Italian miles; the citadel very much re&s;embles that of Antwerp.</P>
<P>The ducal palace, which has nothing very &s;trik|ing in its architecture, lies on the &s;outh &s;ide of the town, and has a communication with the citadel over a bridge. The gallery, formerly &s;o remarkable for its ine&s;timable collection of paintings, medals, antiquities, and other curio&s;ities, together with the library, was &s;tripped by the late King of Spain, when he came to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this duchy, and every thing of value removed to Naples, where it &s;till lays in confu&s;ion at Capo de Monte; &s;o that the object mo&s;t worthy of notice, in this city, is the great theatre, built by Duke <HI>Renatus,</HI> in 1618. This theatre is &s;aid to be the large&s;t of any in Europe, and capable of holding, according to La <HI>Lande,</HI> 12,000 per&s;ons. It is built in the form of the Roman am|phitheatre. What is very &s;ingular in its con&s;truc|tion, and, which, though remarked by every one, no per&s;on has yet been able to account for, is, that a word &s;poken ever &s;o low on the &s;tage, may be di&s;tinctly heard in every part of the pit, and yet
<PB N="162" REF="190">
the greate&s;t elevation of the voice, &s;ays <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> occa&s;ions no echo, to cau&s;e in it the lea&s;t confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The illumination of this theatre being very ex|pen&s;ive, a &s;maller one has been erected for com|mon u&s;e, in a &s;aloon adjoining to it; and this has a pit large enough to contain 2000 &s;pectators.</P>
<P>The gardens of the palace are admired for the grottos, fountains, ca&s;cades, walks, &s;tatues, and other embelli&s;hments.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the univer&s;ity erected by Duke <HI>Rainu|tius</HI> I. in 1599, he al&s;o founded, in 1601, an aca|demy for per&s;ons of noble families, in which young &s;tudents from their childhood are in&s;tructed, not only in grammar, the cla&s;&s;ics, rhetoric, philo&s;ophy, mathematics, geography, hi&s;tory, divinity, the civil, feodal, and canon laws; but, likewi&s;e in the Ger|man, French, and Spani&s;h languages; in mu&s;ic, painting, fortification, dancing, fencing, vaulting, and riding. The annual allowance to each &s;tudent for board, lodging, and tuition, is about 25 pounds a year. The riding-&s;chool is furni&s;hed with hor&s;es from the duke's &s;tables. The foundation admits of 250 &s;tudents. Youths of all nations are received here indi&s;criminately; but with regard to birth, they
<PB N="163" REF="191">
mu&s;t be noble, and &s;uch as are capable of being admitted among the knights of Malta.</P>
<P>The morning lectures generally take up two hours and a half; and tho&s;e of the afternoon about three. The &s;tudents are divided into cla&s;&s;es of 10 or 13; each of which has a &s;ervant and a monitor, who mu&s;t be an eccle&s;ia&s;tic. When they walk about the city, the &s;tudents are dre&s;&s;ed in black; but in hunting, and during the fe&s;tivities, in autumn, they are allowed to wear cloaths of any colour. That &s;tudent who &s;ignalizes him&s;elf mo&s;t by his exerci&s;es, is &s;tiled <HI>Principe,</HI> and has a particular re&s;pect paid him by the re&s;t. He al&s;o wears a medal hanging to a purple ribbon, with a &s;ilver border, on his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>There are two elegant theatres in the college, in one of which the &s;tudents act plays during the car|nival. The autumn vacation they &s;pend at one of the duke's country &s;eats, in fi&s;hing, hunting, and other innocent pa&s;times; but under the care of proper directors; nor are their &s;tudies entirely laid a&s;ide during this &s;ea&s;on. The duke and the prin|cipal nobility of the city lend their coaches and hor&s;es to carry the &s;tudents into the country; and at the expiration of the time allotted them, they are brought back in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="192">The &s;ituation of Parma, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;sley,</HI> is delight|ful; and the paintings in its public edifices afford mo&s;t exqui&s;ite entertainment; being filled with ma&s;ter-pieces of art, by <HI>Corregio,</HI> his rivals, and di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;umption, in the cupola of the dome, co&s;t that immortal arti&s;t his life. Having given him|&s;elf up to the force of his imagination, he hazarded &s;ome bold flights, which are the a&s;toni&s;hment and admiration of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of our days, but di&s;plea&s;ed the canons, who had be&s;poke the piece. Though the price was but &s;lender, they would have it that they had been impo&s;ed upon; and, be&s;ides an arbitrary deduction, they paid him the remainder in copper, which poor <HI>Corregio</HI> was forced to take on his back, and carry &s;ix or &s;even miles to an old country-hou&s;e, where he had his work&s;hop. The incumbrance of the burthen, the heat of the day, and the di&s;tance, together with the indignation and fretfulne&s;s at being &s;o deceived, brought on a pleu|ri&s;y, of which he died three days after, at the age of forty.</P>
<P>The cathedral and &s;everal other churches, in Parma, are covered with <HI>fre&s;cos,</HI> by this arti&s;t. Tho&s;e of the cathedral repre&s;ent virtues per&s;onated by women, in attitudes very elegantly varied.

<P>The di&s;tance from Parma to Placentia is about 33 Engli&s;h miles. About five miles from Parma is a ferry over the river Taro. This river is &s;ome|times very dangerous to pa&s;s. What renders it &s;o is its being &s;welled with heavy rains, which form|ing impetuous torrents, force their way through a light &s;oil, and overflowing the banks of the river, form an unequal bed very difficult to ford, from the uncertainty of the bottom. This is the ca&s;e with many of the rivers in Italy; and to comprehend how true it is that the Italian rivers &s;uddenly change their bed, one may perceive the ve&s;tiges of them now dry, which &s;hew the force of the body of wa|ter that has excavated va&s;t precipices and pits; to|gether with a great quantity of &s;tone and &s;and, that the water has brought down and thrown up into ridges. This change of the cour&s;e of rivers fre|quently
<PB N="168" REF="196">
happens in one night, as the people of the country affirm. A river fordable over-night, has by the next morning been &s;o increa&s;ed, from the addition of mountain torrents, as to render it im|pa&s;&s;able; and &s;hortly after, has &s;hifted its place, leaving its old cour&s;e in heaps of rubbi&s;h and deep hollows.</P>
<P>At a little di&s;tance from the pa&s;&s;age over the Taro, are the two ca&s;tles Guelfo and Gibellino. Both the&s;e ca&s;tles derive their names from the two factions, the Guelphs and Gibellines, by which Germany and Italy were for a long time made a &s;cene of &s;laughter and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The whole of the country, between Piacenza and Parma, is a dead flat; the &s;oil is exceedingly rich; the ground well cultivated, and planted with &s;trait rows of elms, at about the di&s;tance of 12 or 14 yards a&s;under. The&s;e form the mo&s;t delightful vi&s;tas imaginable, and what adds greatly to their beautiful appearance is, that the vines, &s;u&s;tained by the elms, are conducted from tree to tree, forming the mo&s;t graceful fe&s;toons. The ilex and the mul|berry-tree are frequently planted for the &s;upport of the vine, as the elms are, and make a mo&s;t agree|able variety.

<P>Except the ducal palace, and &s;ome pictures in the churches, it does not appear that there is a great deal in this city worthy of attention.</P>
<P>On the fifth of April, the annual fair commences here, which is reckoned the large&s;t in all Italy. It la&s;ts a fortnight. The &s;tands and booths occupy a very large area, near the ducal palace, laid out in regular lanes or pa&s;&s;ages, which are covered with canva&s;s, as a &s;helter both again&s;t rain and the heat of the &s;un. The principal entertainment, during this &s;ea&s;on of bu&s;tle, is the Opera, the admi&s;&s;ion into the pit of which co&s;ts only &s;ix-pence. The fir&s;t &s;ingers in Italy are engaged to perform in it.

<P>Piacenza has given birth to &s;ome famous men; one of the mo&s;t remarkable is the Cardinal <HI>Alberoni,</HI> who was many years prime mini&s;ter at the court of Spain: he was born in 1664, in a mi&s;erable cottage belonging to the &s;uburbs: his father was a gardener, but &s;o poor as to earn his bread by working in the
<PB N="171" REF="199">
little gardens belonging to the citizens: however, in proce&s;s of time, he contrived &s;o to pu&s;h his for|tune as to procure him&s;elf a &s;mall cure, which was to him then the utmo&s;t pinnacle of human felicity. The Duke <HI>de Vendome</HI> accidently coming to the &s;ight of him took a fancy to him, made him his chief aid-du-camp, &s;ecretary, confident, &amp;c. From thence he ro&s;e to be cardinal and prime mini&s;ter of Spain. His ambition afterwards became his ruin, and con&s;trained <HI>Philip</HI> to di&s;grace and bani&s;h him.</P>
<P>After his fall he returned back to Piacenza where &s;o much a&s;hamed was he of his birth, as never to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted, nor even acknowledge, any of his re|lations, during his life nor at his death. He here lived in a private manner, and did no public or pri|vate acts of charity, unle&s;s the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a number of mi&s;&s;ionaries may be deemed as &s;uch. He was con&s;iderably pa&s;t eighty years old when he died. In the year 1746, he had the mortification to &s;ee his &s;eminary battered by all the Spani&s;h and Genoe&s;e artillery, which did not leave a &s;ingle wall &s;tanding. On the Au&s;trians taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his. &s;eminary, he withdrew to Piacenza in an apartment, the whole furniture of which was a bed, a table, and four chairs, where, &s;ays <HI>Gro&s;sley,</HI> a friend of mine &s;aw him with a little pot boiling in the chimney, over the &s;mall fire of an apricot tree, cut that very
<PB N="172" REF="200">
day in the court-yard of the hou&s;e, to which his apartment belonged; neither his money nor his in|tere&s;t having been able to procure him a faggot.</P>
<P>The cardinal was, at that time, above four&s;core, yet without any of the infirmities of old age. He &s;poke Italian, French, or Spani&s;h, according to the affairs or per&s;ons he was talking of; and in the&s;e three languages expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with equal energy and vivacity; his reflections he u&s;ually backed with &s;ome maxims of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> which he always quoted in Latin.</P>
<P>The excellence of the Parme&s;an chee&s;e, &s;o cele|brated at all the elegant tables in Europe, proceeds from the excellent pa&s;tures in this country; parti|cularly tho&s;e about Placentia, where the meadows may be watered during the whole &s;ummer at plea|&s;ure, by means of &s;luices which convey water from the Po. Be&s;ides the waters of that river are im|pregnated with a &s;limy &s;ub&s;tance, which proves a very good manure to the grounds that they over|flow. The cows here yield an uncommon quantity of milk, &s;o that in a good &s;ea&s;on the milk of fifty cows will make a rich chee&s;e of a hundred weight every day. But within a few miles of this fertile track of land, which does not extend above ten Italian miles in length, the cows do not yield &s;uch
<PB N="173" REF="201">
plenty of milk as they do in the Parme&s;an: nor is it &s;o rich. But as in Germany great quantities of Dutch chee&s;es are &s;old which never were in Hol|land, &s;o likewi&s;e many thou&s;and pounds of chee&s;e made in Lodi, Bologna, &amp;c. pa&s;s under the name of Parme&s;an; e&s;pecially as the Milane&s;e pea&s;ants about Lodi, have the like advantage of watering their meadows &s;o as to mow them four or five times a year. There are three kinds of Parme&s;an chee&s;e: and it is in its greate&s;t perfection when it is three or four years old; and that which crumbles, in cut|ting, is reckoned the be&s;t.</P>
<P>At Vianino, near the Apennine mountains, a very palatable chee&s;e is made of &s;heeps milk.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants in this duchy appear gay, and not poor; the women are very prettily dre&s;&s;ed, wearing &s;mall &s;traw hats, ornamented with knots of ribbon of various colours, with a bunch of flowers over all, or a large black feather; and &s;ometimes covering the crown of the hat with a bit of fine fur, which produces a &s;ingular effect. By this means of dre&s;|&s;ing, they have a fine air of the head; and being generally well made and hand&s;ome, or rather of &s;en&s;ible and agreeable countenances, their appear|ance is very different from that of any other pea|&s;ants.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="202">By the laws of Placentia, children &s;hare equally, even in noble inheritance. This equality being the palladium of democratical &s;tates, and the &s;inew of indu&s;try in commercial towns, might &s;uit Placentia before it came under the dominion of the <HI>Farne&s;e</HI> family; but &s;ince that aera, the manufactures being decayed, and the nobility having given over com|merce, this equallity, by &s;ub-dividing the fortunes of the nobility <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> has deprived the country of that re&s;ource which it would have found in the ea&s;y circum&s;tances of the nobles, and filled the country with a race of counts and titled &s;laves, who&s;e dignity is of little weight, without the additional &s;upport of wealth.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;ition is now &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in this duchy, and the churches now no longer afford an a&s;ylum to robbers and murderers. A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and rob|beries which were formerly very frequent, are now in con&s;equence, become very rare. What &s;eems &s;ingular is, that the former, according to Lady <HI>Miller,</HI> are not always puni&s;hed with death, unle&s;s the provocation has been of con&s;iderable &s;tanding, and then pardon &s;eldom follows; but if a man is killed through a gu&s;t of &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion, the galleys or long impri&s;onment is generally the puni&s;hment. They di&s;courage as much as po&s;&s;ible, both in Parma and Placentia, all women of the profe&s;&s;ion of &s;treet

walkers, an inn-keeper being puni&s;hable for &s;uffer|ing them to lodge in his hou&s;e. The Governor of Placentia is extremely vigilant in regard to them, and as &s;oon as they are di&s;covered, has them driven out of the town.</P>
<P>The police in both the&s;e cities, &s;trictly examine all tho&s;e who enter or go out of them. They not only take down the name, from whence they came, and whither they are going, but likewi&s;e make a &s;hort de&s;cription of their per&s;on, &s;o that a per&s;on may be known by it. They are &s;o clever at this, that the &s;horte&s;t time is &s;ufficient for their pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Commis</HI> of the gates having taken the names, de&s;criptions, and number of per&s;ons, not excepting the &s;ervants, enter them at a <HI>bureau</HI> or office for that purpo&s;e. The inn-keeper al&s;o takes the names down, and &s;ends them to the &s;ame <HI>bureau,</HI> where if the entry made at the gate, does not tally with that &s;ent from the inn, a bu&s;tle immediately en&s;ues, and an examination into the mi&s;take.</P>
<P>We are told, that an Engli&s;h gentleman, tired of repeating his name &s;o often, by way of fun, cho&s;e to vary it, and &s;aid he was called <HI>Punchinello;</HI> this gave &s;uch an alarm to the police, that he was pur&s;ued,

<P>The revenues of the Duke of Parma, are computed at between 5 or 600,000 crowns. It is &s;aid, the &s;alt works alone, all charges deducted, yield above 50,000.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXII.</HI> Of the Dukedom of Modena.</HEAD>
<P>The dukedom of Modena, &s;urrounded by the duchies of Parma and Mantua, the eccle&s;ia&s;tical territories, the duchy of Florence, and the republic of Lucca, is 56 miles in extent from north to &s;outh, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t, between 24 and 36.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="205">The territory of this duchy, is a fertile plain, wa|tered by the Po, the Panaro, the Secchia, and Lenza, and every where planted in almo&s;t a continual quincunx, with &s;tately elms, and on each, one or two large vines. The extremities of the&s;e &s;preading vines, reaching &s;o as to be interlaced, form in every interval an ample garland, the natural pro|minence of which, in the middle, probably gave the fir&s;t hint of tho&s;e garlands or fe&s;toons among the ornaments of architecture.</P>
<P>It has been a cu&s;tom among the vintagers, time out of mind, when they are gathering grapes off the&s;e trees near a road, to &s;alute all pa&s;&s;engers, with|out any regard to &s;ex or rank, with every &s;pecies of foul language and ribaldry, u&s;ed in the mo&s;t aban|doned places. An omi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e vociferations would be accounted a neglect of their privileges; and even tho&s;e who at other times are di&s;crete and well behaved, conform to this cu&s;tom; which may be traced back, even to the time of <HI>Horace,</HI> who de&s;cribes one of the&s;e foul-tongued vintagers.</P>
<P>The inhabitants have a method of pre&s;erving ripe grapes from the vintage, till the month of Augu&s;t in the following year, by keeping them in little rooms, well &s;ecured again&s;t the external air, and the light of the &s;un, and they never go into the&s;e &s;tore-rooms
<PB N="178" REF="206">
but with one &s;mall candle, and that as &s;el|dom as po&s;&s;ible. The bunches are not laid upon the floor but hang &s;eparate, being tied to a great number of &s;mall &s;ticks; and when a &s;ingle grape has the lea&s;t appearance of decay or rottenne&s;s, it is plucked off to prevent the re&s;t from the infec|tion.</P>
<P>The horned cattle of this country are very large, and generally white. Six or eight oxen are here put to a carriage, with a great number of bells hang|ing about them, which make no di&s;agreeable noi&s;e. The de&s;ign of this &s;ound is to cheer the creatures under their labour, and to give notice at a di&s;tance on the road that &s;uch a carriage is coming.</P>
<P>This duchy abounds not only in excellent wine, but in corn, garden-fruits, and other productions. In &s;ome parts, particularly near Reggio, is found an excellent alkaline earth, which, being pulverized, is u&s;ed as a &s;overeign remedy again&s;t poi&s;on, fevers, dy&s;enteries, and hypocondriac di&s;orders.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of the country, about Modena, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> is of a &s;ingular con&s;titution, and well de|&s;erves the attention of the curious naturali&s;t. It gives no &s;mall weight to the opinion, that petrefactions are chiefly owing to the univer&s;al deluge. In every
<PB N="179" REF="207">
part, not only of the city, but of the adjacent coun|try, plenty of good water is to be found; but the ground mu&s;t be dug to the depth of 63 feet. For the fir&s;t 14 feet are found large &s;tones, which &s;eem to be the remains of paved &s;treets and buildings; and from hence there is &s;ufficient rea&s;on to con|clude, that the foundations of this city were an|ciently much lower than they are at pre&s;ent. In the lowe&s;t &s;tratum, next the water, are found &s;ea-&s;hells, and other indications of an inundation and deluge. This &s;tratum is very firm; and by only boring a little way into it, great plenty of good water immediately &s;prings up. In &s;ome of the in|termediate &s;trata are found ru&s;hes, leaves of plants, and branches of trees.</P>
<P>Modena, the capital, is &s;ituated agreeably in a plain; it is well built, and ornamented with foun|tains and arcades, which are really noble to walk under, in all the principal &s;treets. The churches are, for the mo&s;t part, in a bad ta&s;te. There is a public library well furni&s;hed with u&s;eful, though not with very curious books, and a mo&s;t comfortable and elegant public room to &s;tudy in. The number of inhabitants in this city are e&s;timated at 23,000.</P>
<P>The ducal palace is by much the fine&s;t edifice here; it &s;tands alone in a great piazza, and in the
<PB N="180" REF="208">
be&s;t quarter of the town. The architecture is both maje&s;tic and elegant; the architect was <HI>Avanzini.</HI> The court is &s;pacious, and &s;urrounded by colonades, which have a fine effect. The great &s;tair-ca&s;e is in a noble &s;tile of architecture, and makes a &s;triking appearance. The palace is full of very fine pic|tures, which to the majority of our readers, would be tedious to enumerate.</P>
<P>The duke chiefly takes up his re&s;idence at Milan: his partiality to the Engli&s;h is &s;o great that even when at Modena he permits them to &s;ee the palace at any hour they think proper, without previous no|tice, and quite undre&s;&s;ed; even boots are not ob|jected to: this is an exclu&s;ive privilege.</P>
<P>The troops of Modena are well dre&s;&s;ed, and make a good appearance; they parade about with a &s;trong band of mu&s;ic, con&s;i&s;ting of drums, fifes, hautboys, and French-horns. The Duke is &s;aid to have 8000 men in con&s;tant array, and that upon occa&s;ion he can bring 20,000 men into the field.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t illu&s;trious families are the hou&s;es of <HI>Rangoni</HI> and <HI>Montecuculli.</HI> There are no remains of the families of tho&s;e petty tyrants who governed Modena before the hou&s;e of <HI>E&s;t</HI> were cho&s;en for their &s;overeigns.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="209">The Modene&s;e &s;eem a gay chearful people; have much genius for pantomine &s;hows, and what is called plea&s;ure, or rather di&s;&s;ipation.

<P>Modena is a very ancient city, and frequently mentioned in the Roman hi&s;tory. When <HI>Decius Brutus</HI> was be&s;ieged here, <HI>Hertius</HI> made u&s;e of tame pigeons, (which by hunger he had trained up to this &s;ervice,) as me&s;&s;engers, to give the be&s;ieged advice of his intentions, and to receive intelligence from <HI>Decius Brutus</HI> on their return. The memory of this device is perpetuated even to this very day at Modena, where pigeons are taught to carry let|ters to a place appointed, and bring back an&s;wers. Of what benefit the&s;e letter-carriers proved to the city of Leyden, when hard pre&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards,

<P>The city of Modena boa&s;ts of having given birth to &s;everal eminent per&s;ons, among whom they reckon <HI>Sigoni,</HI> the civilian and hi&s;torian; <HI>Fallopi</HI> the phy&s;ician, from whom certain tubes in the hu|man body derive their name: <HI>Corregio</HI> the painter; <HI>Ale&s;&s;andro Ta&s;&s;oni</HI> the poet; and the Imperial general <HI>Montecuculli.</HI></P>
<P>In the cathedral of Modena is &s;hewn a very un|common trophy of the valour of the inhabitants, namely, a wooden bucket, with iron hoops, which the Modene&s;e, (for what purpo&s;e is not mentioned,) brought away from Bologna, and keep as a memo|rial of their expedition to the capital city of their enemies. The war was originally occa&s;ioned by the Bologne&s;e refu&s;ing to re&s;tore &s;ome towns ac|cording to compact.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XX.</HI> Situation, Extent, City and Police, Productions, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE independent Republic of Genoa, be&s;ides that long tract of land on the continent, which lies on the coa&s;t of an exten&s;ive gulf in the Medi|terranean, anciently called <HI>Mare Ligu&s;ticum,</HI> was, till within the&s;e few years, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica. At pre&s;ent its dominions are confined to the continent, and are in length, from we&s;t to ea&s;t, about 152 Engli&s;h miles; but, from north to &s;outh, they are very narrow, in &s;ome parts only eight Engli&s;h miles, and in the broade&s;t not above 20. They are bounded by the principality of Piedmont, the duchy of Milan, and the grand dukedoms of Tu&s;cany.</P>
<P>The land of this little territory, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> can neither boa&s;t pa&s;tures covered with fat oxen, nor fields rich in corn and hemp, like Piedmont and Lombardy. It is a rocky country, almo&s;t without timber, and not abounding in wine: yet the inha|bitants
<PB N="185" REF="213">
have no rea&s;on to envy their neighbours. For be&s;ides their lemons and oranges, which yield a con&s;iderable &s;um, they have a tree which makes them ample amends for whatever they may want. This tree is the olive, which thrives here perhaps better than in any part of the known world.</P>
<P>To give &s;ome idea of the advantage which the Genoe&s;e reap from their olive-trees, we will &s;ay, that on the we&s;tern extremity of their country there is an independant principality &s;o &s;mall that it may be lei&s;urely walked over in a morning.</P>
<P>This empire, in miniature, is little more $han &s;ix miles long, and only half a one in breadth, where it is broade&s;t. And yet there are upon it two towns Monaco and Mentone, containing about 5000 in|habitants between them; a village with about 400 &s;ouls in it, and about 600 inhabitants more, who live in &s;ingle hou&s;es and cottages, &s;cattered up and down the mountains, which limit this principality on the north as the &s;ea does on the &s;outh. It is not a little &s;urpri&s;ing that 6000 people &s;hould find their &s;u&s;tenance in a tract of land &s;carce four miles &s;quare, at a di&s;tance from all populous towns. Yet it is &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing, that almo&s;t the whole of their &s;upport &s;hould ari&s;e from their oil, which they make in &s;uch con&s;iderable quantities, that the thir|teenth
<PB N="186" REF="214">
part which they pay in kind, as &s;ubjects, to their &s;overeign, brings herein an income of about 4000 pounds &s;terling: &s;o that &s;uppo&s;ing all the owners of olive-trees faithful in giving the full thir|teenth part of their re&s;pective produce, the oil pro|duced by &s;o &s;mall a tract of land, mu&s;t be worth between 50 and 60,000 pounds &s;terling annually. We are therefore not to wonder, if the Genoe&s;e, many parts of who&s;e territory, along that coa&s;t, are &s;till more valuable than the principality of Monaco, &s;hould have many rich &s;ubjects: nor are we to won|der when we are informed, by different writers, that there are in Genoa &s;everal palaces &s;o large and mag|nificent, as to be re&s;idences meet for kings and em|perors; nor to be a&s;toni&s;hed that &s;o &s;mall a &s;tate &s;hould boa&s;t of &s;everal families, &s;uch as the <HI>Doria, Spinola, Grimaldi,</HI> and others who&s;e names are as well known as tho&s;e of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious per&s;ons in the we&s;tern world. Where intrin&s;ic and real riches abound, great buildings will be rai&s;ed, and great families formed on the lea&s;t concurrence of indu&s;try, with a favourable turn of fortune.</P>
<P>Of the mountains, which occupy a great part of their country, &s;ome are covered with wood, &s;ome quite barren and rocky, and others yield good pa&s;|tures. Though the Genoe&s;e, on account of their want of arable land, are under the nece&s;&s;ity of fur|ni&s;hing
<PB N="187" REF="215">
them&s;elves with great quantities of corn from Lombardy, Sicily, Naples, and other coun|tries; yet &s;uch is their &s;kill and indu&s;try in improv|ing a mountainous, rocky, and &s;terile &s;oil, that all the year round, Genoa is plentifully furni&s;hed with pul&s;e and garden-&s;tuff, in their highe&s;t perfection. The country al&s;o produces both common and mu&s;|cadel wine, plenty of excellent fruit, and particu|larly in the we&s;tern part, lemons, oranges, pome|granates, figs, and almonds; be&s;ides many large plantations of mulberry-trees, intended chiefly for &s;ilk-worms. The olives generally grow about Spe|tia bay: and, here it will not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that the olive-tree pretty much re&s;embles a willow, and makes but a mean appearance; that the be&s;t oil is white and tran&s;parent; that the deep yellow is made from over ripe olives, or from &s;uch as have been kept too long, and that good oil has no &s;mell, and is de&s;titute of any kind of vi&s;cid fatne&s;s. The virgin oil, by the ancients called green oil, is pre&s;&s;ed both from ripe and unripe olives; and is the white&s;t, mo&s;t palatable, and in every re&s;pect the be&s;t.</P>
<P>And this &s;erves, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> to explain a pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Suetonius,</HI> concerning <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar's</HI> good-nature and conde&s;cen&s;ion in eating old rancid oil, that he might not put the per&s;on who entertained him to
<PB N="188" REF="216">
the blu&s;h by a&s;king for green oil which he had not provided. Some commentators are of opinion that <HI>David,</HI> to expre&s;s God's &s;ingular favours to him, makes u&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion in one of the p&s;alms, 'I am anointed with green oil,' as denoting the be&s;t kind of oil.</P>
<P>The oils of Sicily, Greece, and the Levant, are of &s;uch a vi&s;cid fatne&s;s as renders them much infe|rior to tho&s;e of Italy; and this again mu&s;t yield to the Provence oil, of which great quantities are u&s;ed for the tables of per&s;ons of rank, both at Naples and Rome.</P>
<P>Salt &s;o abounds throughout the country, that it can be &s;pared for exportation, as can al&s;o the &s;tone and marble in its quarries.</P>
<P>A great many rivers water the&s;e territories, but none are large enough to de&s;erve notice.</P>
<P>Genoa was the capital of ancient Liguria, and a city of &s;uch commerce, that merchants from all parts of the world re&s;orted to it. Modern writers term it Janua, and affirm, that it was built by <HI>Janus.</HI> But the an|cients always called it Genua. It was de&s;troyed by <HI>Mago</HI> the Carthaginian, but rebuilt by the Romans, and after them, fell under the power of the Ea&s;tern

Roman Emperors. In the year 670, it was &s;acked by the Longobardi, under who&s;e dominion it con|tinued till <HI>Charlemagne</HI> expelled them. After this, Genoa for &s;ome centuries acknowledged for &s;ove|reigns, the Kings of Germany, and the Roman Em|perors; but by degrees, erected it&s;elf into an inde|pendent &s;tate. In the twelfth century, the Genoe&s;e &s;ubjected the city of Syracu&s;e, half the kingdom of Sardinia, and even made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Black Sea, and all its parts, and &s;ettled them&s;elves in the Crim. In the 15th century, being extremely weakened by a long &s;truggle with the Venetians for the &s;uperiority at &s;ea, they were entirely driven from the Crimea. They were &s;oon after obliged to put them&s;elves under the protection of the Kings of France, who, treating them with intolerable <HI>bauteur,</HI> that naval hero, <HI>Andrew Doria,</HI> in 1528, re&s;cued his country out of their hands, &s;ettled it in perfect freedom, and e&s;tabli&s;hed its pre&s;ent con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Genoa, is one of the mo&s;t in|convenient, yet one of the mo&s;t beautiful, of any city in Italy, or as <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> &s;ays, in the world: it is &s;een to the greate&s;t advantage, at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a league at &s;ea; its &s;tately buildings, which have gained it the name of <HI>&s;uperba,</HI> forming a glorious amphitheatre, gradually ri&s;ing along the hill. This declivity, and the narrowne&s;s of the
<PB N="190" REF="219">
&s;treets, &s;ome of which are not above &s;ix feet wide, preclude the u&s;e of coaches in Genoa; every body contenting them&s;elves with going on foot, except the principal ladies, who are carried in chairs. To this narrowne&s;s of the &s;treets, it is owing that this city takes up &s;o little of the plain before it. Ano|ther rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for it is, that the loftine&s;s of the hou&s;es, and the narrowne&s;s of the &s;treets, abate the &s;ummers exce&s;&s;ive heats, by intercepting the &s;un-beams, and thus tend to pre&s;erve the healthfulne&s;s of the city. This al&s;o was the opinion of the old Romans, and there was &s;ome murmuring, when <HI>Nero,</HI> after the conflagration of the city, altered the former method, and ordered that the hou&s;es &s;hould neither be built &s;o high as before, nor contiguous to each other. Some were of opinion, &s;ays <HI>Tacitus,</HI> that the ancient mode was more conducive to health, &s;ince by the narrowne&s;s of the &s;treets, and the height of the hou&s;es, the heat of the &s;un was in &s;ome mea&s;ure broken; but that now, by the pre&s;ent open di&s;po&s;ition, the city is expo&s;ed to all its vio|lence, without any thing to intercept the &s;olar rays. The &s;treets are exceedingly well paved, and in &s;ome parts with free &s;tone. There being no coaches nor other carriages in them, conduces not a little to their cleanne&s;s; be&s;ides the barrenne&s;s of the neigh|bouring &s;oil requiring great quantities of manure, the dung of hor&s;es and mules is very carefully ga|thered
<PB N="191" REF="220">
up. What the Arabs do out of &s;uper&s;tition with regard to tho&s;e camels which have been in the Mecca caravans, the poor people here do from nece&s;&s;ity, carefully picking up all the hor&s;e and mule dung they meet with. This is chiefly ob|&s;erved in the &s;uburbs, where the breadth of the &s;treets admits the u&s;e of all kinds of wheel car|riages.</P>
<P>Genoa, ob&s;erves <HI>Martyn,</HI> is built on the &s;ide of a mountain, in a &s;emi-circle round the harbour. For magnificent buildings, and beauty of &s;ituation, it may vie with any city. It is &s;urrounded by a double wall, one encompa&s;&s;ing it immediately, the other taking in all the ri&s;ing grounds that command it. There is a mo&s;t agreeable walk round the ramparts, from the convent of <HI>S. Antonio,</HI> to the fanale, or light-hou&s;e. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain about 80,000 inhabitants. The &s;treets are crowded, the &s;hops well furni&s;hed, and the markets abound in ex|cellent provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The whole range of rocks on the Genoe&s;e coa&s;t, is either &s;late or marble, and very &s;teep. The in|du&s;try of the inhabitants here, particularly in the environs of this city, made amends for the want of fertility in the mountains, which are in general co|vered with olives, vines, pomegranates, orange and
<PB N="192" REF="221">
lemon trees; and adorned with buildings and gardens.</P>
<P>From the rocks projecting into the &s;ea, have been made &s;everal ba&s;tions, in &s;ome places two or three behind each other, and the length of the&s;e fortifications, with the lower tower, is not le&s;s than three Italian miles. The number of guns mounted on all the works, for the defence of the city, is little &s;hort of five hundred. This city is ten miles in circumference, and &s;uch is the inequality of the country, that it takes up three hours to ride round it. Its wall is of too great ex|tent to be of any great &s;ervice, unle&s;s perhaps, in keeping out the banditti. On entering the city, travellers mu&s;t deliver up their fire-arms, for which they receive half a tally; but they may have them again directly, if they plea&s;e to accompany their tally with a piece of money, though properly, this &s;hould not be complied with, till the party is going to leave the city. The we&s;t &s;ide of the city, is watered by the river <HI>Bonzevera,</HI> and on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide runs another, with a &s;tone bridge over each.</P>
<P>The harbour of Genoa is large, but not very &s;afe; and to fence it farther from the &s;outh wind, would make the entrance too narrow, and con&s;equently be a detriment or inconvenience to the city. In the
<PB N="185" REF="222">
middle of the harbour, on a place called the Royal Bridge, is a commodious watering place for &s;hips, the water being conveyed by pipes from the moun|tains.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the harbour is the Porto Franco, containing the warehou&s;es of the merchants, admira|bly di&s;po&s;ed in a &s;eparate enclo&s;ure, opened only at certain times. All merchandize mu&s;t be lodged here, and pays no cu&s;tom at entrance; whatever is &s;old for the con&s;umption of the city, pays eight or ten <HI>per cent</HI> upon the value, but all that is exported, pays only a &s;light duty. They do not &s;uffer eccle&s;i|a&s;tics, officers, women, or livery &s;ervants, to enter without particular permi&s;&s;ion. Within this harbour, is the Dar&s;ena, or wet dock, for the gallies of the republics. From the formidable figure which the Genoe&s;e fleet made in times pa&s;t, it is now reduced to &s;ix gallies, and all the u&s;e of the&s;e is to fetch corn from Naples and Sicily, and to give the ladies an airing. The complement of the large&s;t gallies, is from 60 to a 100 &s;oldiers, and 320 rowers, five or &s;ix on a bench, which &s;erves them for a bed. The Dar&s;ena abounds with Turki&s;h &s;laves, who are ge|nerally of a &s;urly, fierce a&s;pect, to which their long whi&s;kers do not a little contribute. In the Dar&s;ena they are at liberty; but in the city one meets them every where chained in couples, and crying chee&s;e,
<PB N="186" REF="223">
cotton, cloth, &amp;c. They al&s;o keep tipling-hou&s;es and petty &s;hops in the Dar&s;ena, their officers giving them all po&s;&s;ible encouragement, and advancing them a &s;mall &s;um of money, with which, in their trips to Mar&s;eilles, Cor&s;ica, and other places, they buy all kinds of knick-knacks at a very cheap rate, and make a good market of them at Genoa, where every thing is extremely dear; but the officers come in for a &s;hare of the profits: &s;ome of the&s;e &s;laves are furni&s;hed with goods to trade with, out of the re|publics warehou&s;es, part for ready money, and part on credit, at a &s;tated price. At night none of them are to be ab&s;ent from the Dar&s;ena, for they are mu&s;|tered and locked up every evening. Private per&s;ons who have been &s;ucce&s;sful in fitting out &s;hips again&s;t the Barbary cor&s;airs, may keep &s;uch &s;laves; but they are generally &s;old to the &s;tate, which puts them to the be&s;t u&s;e, and can be&s;t &s;ecure them. Their common employment is knitting woollen &s;tockings and caps. This &s;hews the lenity and indulgence of the Chri&s;tians towards the Mahometan captives, very different from the hard&s;hips impo&s;ed on the Chri&s;tians, who have the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Turki&s;h cor&s;airs.</P>
<P>The rowers on board the Turki&s;h gallies, gene|rally con&s;i&s;t of three cla&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t cla&s;s is of in|digent people, who &s;ell them&s;elves for a certain term
<PB N="187" REF="224">
of years, among whom, are many Italians and Pied|monte&s;e, and the common price of &s;uch at Genoa, is 60 or 70 livres for the &s;pace of two years cer|tain. The &s;econd cla&s;s are criminals, who have been &s;entenced to try at the oar for a limited time, or during life. The third &s;ort are Turki&s;h or Bar|bary pri&s;oners, who, though they become converts to chri&s;tianity, do not recover their freedom; but it is not uncommon for them, by means of their godfathers, to be put into a better way of living, and upon their good behaviour, to obtain their liberty.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who behave well, are allowed to have little &s;hops or &s;heds on the quay. The&s;e are all chained to their &s;hops, but the chains being pretty long, they can move about in them, and even backward and forward before their doors. Others are permitted to go all over the town, chained in couples, and hawk about fi&s;h, matts, &amp;c. Sometimes it has hap|pened, that the&s;e poor creatures, thus coupled, quar|rel, and frequently from &s;uch trifling cau&s;es as one of them wi&s;hing to go one way, and the other a different one; the&s;e di&s;putes at la&s;t have ri&s;en to &s;uch a height, that the con&s;equences might have been fatal, had they not been timely &s;eparated. On the other hand friend&s;hips have commenced from the &s;imilitude of their misfortunes; &s;o that the greate&s;t
<PB N="188" REF="225">
harmony has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among &s;ome of them. There is one man who has been chained to his little &s;hop on the quay, where he has vended coffee and li|quors for 18 years, and by his indu&s;try acquired up|wards of 40,000 livres: he offered 10,000 to Prince D&mdash; for his liberty, but the Prince demanded 20, and the gallerian thought that even freedom might be purcha&s;ed too dear; he therefore remains a &s;lave, barefooted, his head &s;haved, and wears a loo&s;e &s;hort <HI>redingotte,</HI> of coar&s;e cloth, lined with &s;hag, nor &s;eems to indulge him&s;elf with any convenience or comfort of life, more than his comrades, though &s;o much richer. However to prevent Prince D. and the other magi&s;trates from profiting by his death he has entered into partner&s;hip with a younger &s;lave, whom he has made his heir, which it &s;eems was nece&s;&s;ary for the above purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the idea received in this country of the wretched &s;ituation of a galley-&s;lave is very much exaggerated. To tho&s;e gallerians, who were originally poor and hard labouring pea&s;ants, the being a galley-&s;lave can &s;carce be deemed a mis|fortune.</P>
<P>The <HI>faro,</HI> or light-hou&s;e, a tower which is a&s;cended by 166 &s;teps, &s;tands on the we&s;t &s;ide of the harbour, and is &s;ituated on a high rock, which is al&s;o forti|fied.
<PB N="189" REF="226">
Every night, except about the &s;ummer &s;ol|&s;tice, a lanthorn, with 36 lamps, is hung out at the top of it, toward the &s;ea; and when a number of &s;hips or any fleet is known to be in the&s;e &s;eas, an addition is made to the number of lamps, which, yet at a di&s;tance, appear like a &s;ingle &s;tar.</P>
<P>In the <HI>piazza nuova,</HI> or new &s;quare, before the Doge's palace, is a daily market, Sundays not ex|cepted for vegetables and other provi&s;ion; and in the middle of January here are expo&s;ed to &s;ale, green peas, artichokes, and water melons, in great plenty; be&s;ides hyacinths, and mo&s;t kinds of flow|ers in full bloom.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t &s;treet in the whole city is the <HI>&s;trada nuova,</HI> or the new &s;treet, which is 12 common paces in breadth, and planned by <HI>Galeazzi,</HI> an architect of Perugia, who al&s;o built mo&s;t of the fine palaces in it. Among the&s;e are 10 or 12 of mo&s;t remark|able beauty and magnificence. The fir&s;t floors of the&s;e palaces open into beautiful gardens and oran|geries, like the <HI>horti pen&s;iles</HI> of the ancients. Over the entrance of the palace of <HI>Doria</HI> is written this motto, <HI>Nulli certa domus.</HI> 'No one has a fixed ha|bitation.' The very &s;ame words &s;tand over the door of the Republic's palace, and are well adapted to the Doge's &s;hort continuance in it. The palace
<PB N="190" REF="227">
of <HI>Imperiali in Competto,</HI> has a very fine pro&s;pect of two &s;treets, of which the owner of this palace is proprietor, who from one window can look down on a &s;pot of no great extent, which brings him in 4000 pounds a year. The <HI>&s;trada Balbi</HI> is but little inferior to the <HI>&s;trada nuova</HI> in beauty, and exceeds it in length and breadth. Two palaces of the <HI>Balbi</HI> family, the Je&s;uits college, and the palace of <HI>Du|razzo</HI> are great ornaments to it, the latter being 140 common paces in front, is inconte&s;tably the fine&s;t private building in the whole city, and its furniture an&s;werable to its outward magnificence. In this palace are &s;ome exqui&s;ite paintings, and on the third &s;tory is an open gallery, decked all round with beauti|ful urns for flowers, which affords a grand pro&s;pect of the harbour, &amp;c. and leads to a mo&s;t charming garden, adorned with fountains, and walks of orange and citron trees. The palace of Prince <HI>Doria,</HI> near the light-hou&s;e, has the &s;ame conve|nience, and formerly there was a &s;tone key behind the garden, by means of which the family could &s;tep out of the garden into their barge, but that is now altered. Whil&s;t the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. once lodged in this palace, apartments were &s;uddenly run up; at the end of which, to his great &s;urpri&s;e, he found a fine yacht ready to receive him. Prince <HI>Doria</HI> ordered all the plate, both gold and &s;ilver u&s;ed at the entertainment, to be thrown overboard,
<PB N="191" REF="228">
whil&s;t the Spani&s;h noblemen, in the Emperor's re|tinue, &s;tood looking at one another with a&s;toni&s;h|ment at this apparent extravagance, little knowing that care had been taken to &s;pread nets all about the ve&s;&s;el; and that the Spaniards from the va&s;t quantity of plate, might not imagine any of it was borrowed, the Prince had the following in&s;cription in Spani&s;h put on that &s;ide of the palace, which is oppo&s;ite the light-hou&s;e: 'Thanks to God and the King; in this hou&s;e there is nothing borrowed.'</P>
<P>On the left hand of the entrance into the gardens is the image of a mon&s;ter, &s;tanding in a fountain, who&s;e fore part re&s;embles a &s;atyr, with two &s;mall horns, but its hind part has a double fi&s;h's tail erect. This mon&s;ter is &s;aid to have been taken alive. In the middle of the garden is a larger foun|tain, where among &s;everal marble &s;tatues is one in the gigantic ta&s;te of the famous <HI>Andrew Doria,</HI> who died in the year 1560, after a life of the mo&s;t ho|nourable &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and full of days, for he lived 93 years. As a public acknowledgment of his eminent &s;ervices to his country, every year, on the fifteenth of September, the captain of the ducal palace, at|tended by 200 &s;oldiers, carries the city keys in a di&s;h, to the Prince of <HI>Doria,</HI> who, on this occa&s;ion, entertains them with a fea&s;t. At the&s;e times the mo&s;t magnificent furniture of his palace, his ad|mirable
<PB N="192" REF="229">
pictures, plate, tape&s;try, looking gla&s;&s;es, tables, &amp;c. are finely di&s;played. Another mark of the republic's gratitude is, that foreigners ex|cepted, the Princes of <HI>Dona</HI> and their dome&s;tics only, are allowed to wear &s;words within the city, none of the nobility being permitted to do it, unle&s;s when going on a journey.</P>
<P>From the &s;econd &s;tory of this palace is a pa&s;&s;age over a little bridge into another garden, laid out in a very agreeable variety along the acclivity of the hill; and on the top of it, is a gigantic &s;tatue of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> made of pla&s;ter, re&s;ting his foot upon a great dog, who&s;e good qualities are celebrated in the following epetaph:</P>
<P>Here lies the great <HI>Rolando,</HI> a dog belonging to Prince <HI>John Andrew Doria,</HI> who&s;e un&s;haken fidelity and good nature, entitled him to this monument; and having when alive, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by an uniform practice of both the&s;e good qualities, it was judged no more than ju&s;tice, to depo&s;it his re|mains near <HI>Jupiter,</HI> as truly worthy of his royal protection. He lived eleven years and ten months, and died the &s;eventh of September, at five o'Clock in the evening, in the year 1605.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="230">Tho&s;e who may think it a pro&s;titution of epi|taphs, that one &s;hould be be&s;towed on a dog, and the hour of his death &s;o particularly &s;et down, will pro|bably think the legacy of five hundred crowns a-year, for the maintainance of that animal, none of the mo&s;t commendable. <HI>Spartian,</HI> in the 20th chapter of the Life of <HI>Hadrian,</HI> repre&s;ents this Em|peror as &s;uch a lover of hor&s;es and dogs, that he erected monuments to them. <HI>Charles</HI> XII. the war|like King of Sweden, had &s;uch a regard for his dog <HI>Pompey,</HI> who every where attended him, that the creature happening to die in Poland, he had it car|ried into Sweden, that it might not lie out of its na|tive country.</P>
<P>The cathedral is dedicated to <HI>S. Lawrence,</HI> and in a chapel where 30 &s;ilver lamps are continually burning, is kept with great veneration the bones of <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t. But the principal curio&s;ity in this church, and accounted &s;o valuable, that it may not be &s;een without the Archbi&s;hop's leave, is an emerald di&s;h; &s;aid to be a pre&s;ent from the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> to <HI>Solomon.</HI> It is pretended, that it was af|terwards u&s;ed for the pa&s;chal lamb, and after that, by our Saviour at the la&s;t &s;upper, and la&s;tly came to the republic of Genoa, either by the genero&s;ity of <HI>Baldwin,</HI> King of Jeru&s;alem, or as its &s;hare of the plunder of the city of Cae&s;area, in the year 1101.
<PB N="194" REF="231">
This di&s;h is of a round figure, with an hexagonical rim, and is eight inches and a half, or near two common palms in diameter, and about five palms in circumference. It is quite plain, without any carv|ing or &s;culpture; but what is mo&s;t remarkable is, that it is made of one &s;ingle emerald, which, for dimen&s;ions, is to be paralleled only with that at the convent of Reichenau, in Baden-&s;ee, which we have already noticed.</P>
<P>The &s;acred edifice of Genoa, like tho&s;e at Na|ples, remarks <HI>Gro&s;sley,</HI> are full of funeral in&s;crip|tions, but in general, as plain as tho&s;e of Naples are, turgid and bomba&s;tical. They have com|monly annexed to them, &s;ome moral or prudential maxim, for the u&s;e of the traveller who &s;tops to read them. On the frieze of the magnificent tomb of one of the name of <HI>Spinola,</HI> is the follow|ing, in large characters:
<Q><L>Quod per te facere potes,</L>
<L>Alteri ne commi&s;eris.</L></Q></P>
<P>i. e. Leave not to another, what you can do your&s;elf.</P>
<P>In &s;ome public places are in&s;criptions of another kind, al&s;o con&s;ecrated to po&s;terity, but perpetuat|ing the infamous memory of &s;uch as have injured
<PB N="195" REF="232">
the &s;tate, and who&s;e names are &s;et up in the chief places of the Genoe&s;e territories. The perpetu|ating monuments of this kind, can &s;carce be re|conciled with that humane maxim of <HI>gratiae am|pliandae, odia re&s;tringenda,</HI> "Favours &s;hould be mul|tiplied, di&s;&s;ervices re&s;trained."</P>
<P>Near St. <HI>Mary's</HI> church is a &s;tone bridge, which joins together two eminences in the city, formerly &s;eparated by a deep valley. This bridge cannot be &s;een without a&s;toni&s;hment, for it con&s;i&s;ts of one &s;mall and three large arches, of &s;uch a height, as to be elevated ten or twelve feet above &s;everal hou&s;es of five or &s;ix &s;tories, &s;o that it cro&s;&s;es a large &s;treet. The breadth of this extraordinary bridge is 45 feet, and its length about 160 or 170 paces.</P>
<P>The &s;tate palace is an old mean building, the left &s;ide of which is a&s;&s;igned to the Doge, who&s;e table al&s;o is defrayed at the public expence; it &s;tands almo&s;t in the centre of the city, and has a guard at the entrance. From the audience room a pa&s;&s;age leads to the ar&s;enal, over the entrance of which, is the ro&s;trum of an ancient Roman &s;hip. It is about three &s;pans in length, and its greate&s;t thickne&s;s is two thirds of a foot. Near it are the&s;e words: This ancient Roman ro&s;trum, the only one
<PB N="196" REF="233">
which has hitherto been found, was digged up when this harbour was cleared, in the year 1597, and by order of the &s;tates, &s;et up as a monument of the great naval glory of our ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The ar&s;enal contains above 25,000 mu&s;quets, and among other curio&s;ities is a &s;hield with 120 pi&s;tol barrels fixed in it, which may be fired in three equal di&s;charges of 40 at a time; likewi&s;e the cuira&s;&s;es of &s;everal Genoe&s;e ladies, who, under Pope <HI>Boni|face</HI> VIII. performed a cru&s;ade to the holy land. This armour, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> is nicely contrived for women, yet there are &s;ome ridiculous peculiari|ties belonging to it. Among other &s;ingular war|like matters, there is a wooden cannon, lined in the in&s;ide with a thin plate of bra&s;s, and a &s;word with a pi&s;tol in it.</P>
<P>The public charities of the individuals of Genoa, &s;urpa&s;s, perhaps, tho&s;e of any other country in Eu|rope, of its extent and revenue; witne&s;s the va&s;t number of churches and convents founded and en|dowed by private citizens, the great ho&s;pital, by voluntary contributions, the <HI>Albergo,</HI> the Port <HI>Frene,</HI> the hou&s;e for 300 girls, by one &s;ubject; the church and bridge of Carignan, by another; a foundation for the maintenance of 240 nuns, of the order of S. <HI>There&s;a,</HI> by the <HI>Brignoli</HI> family, who are obliged
<PB N="197" REF="234">
to attend the foundling ho&s;pital and the Albergo. <HI>Marcellinus Durazzo</HI>'s little college for 12 poor boys of noble parentage: this building joins to his own palace: they are found in every thing at his &s;ole expence, and have proper ma&s;ters to qualify them for different profe&s;&s;ions, according to their &s;everal abilities and inclinations.</P>
<P>The Albergo is a building of great extent, and does honour to the Genoe&s;e; &s;erving at once for charitable u&s;es, and for a hou&s;e of correction. One wing is appropriated to the females, the other to the males; that for the females is divided among illegitimate females, and legitimate orphans, who by having lo&s;t their parents are deprived of the care, education, and maintenance they might otherwi&s;e have been entitled to. The legitimate females con&s;i&s;t of about 450, who are taught embroidery, knitting, and plain-work; are well cloathed and fed, and often marry into rich citizens families. Poor old infirm people, pa&s;t their labour, are main|tained here during the remainder of their days. Poor people al&s;o, who cannot afford them&s;elves lodging places, having previou&s;ly proved to the council their nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances, obtain beds for one night, and are always offered a bowl of &s;oup, and a pound and a half of bread, before they depart in the morning. All &s;trangers of every
<PB N="198" REF="235">
country and poor travellers are allowed to lodge and $at as mentioned above. The boys, who are about 500, are taught all &s;orts of handicrafts; and if they have no friends or relations to protect them when fit to earn their bread, are &s;et up in different trades at the charge of the fund, which is very con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cambeaces,</HI> of which there are now five fa|milies, originally &s;prung from trade, and who are &s;till merchants, give every day a bowl of &s;oup, and a pound of bread, to each of the poor who pre&s;ent them&s;elves at their gate; if it &s;hould &s;o happen that, at any time, there is not a &s;ufficiency of &s;oup for all, the grown per&s;ons receive each four &s;ous, and the children two, in lieu of it. The number of poor is generally from 3 to 500: they are gene|rally &s;trangers, for there are not many natives of the Republic in &s;uch nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances as to want bread. They al&s;o give once a year to poor women, who apply for them, a &s;hift, with a <HI>cor&s;et,</HI> and petticoat; to the men, a &s;hirt, a great coat, with a hood to it, a pair of breeches, and &s;hoes. At the end of the year tho&s;e who pre&s;ent them&s;elves in the cloaths that had been given them, are im|mediately new cloathed; but others who &s;hew no remains of the former bounty have their conduct &s;trictly &s;crutinized. A little of the &s;oup, out of the
<PB N="199" REF="236">
great boiler, is always carried to one of the family to ta&s;te, before it is di&s;tributed to the poor, le&s;t by the want of attention or neglect of the &s;ervants, it &s;hould not be good. It is remarkable that the great expence, which they are at, has had no ten|dency to dimini&s;h their circum&s;tances, as they have for more than a century pa&s;t, been encrea&s;ing in riches.</P>
<P>The theatre of this city is rather large than &s;mall, but not beautiful, either as to architecture or paint|ing. All the boxes below &s;tairs are &s;hut in with <HI>jalou&s;ies,</HI> except when the owners chu&s;e to &s;hew them&s;elves to the audience, at which time they light them up with wax candles, and the <HI>jalou&s;ies</HI> are removed.</P>
<P>Every Sunday evening during the winter, an oratorio or religious opera is performed in one of the churches, which is &s;ucceeded by a &s;ermon; and then the &s;ervice concludes with a piece of church mu&s;ic. As the de&s;ign of this is to keep people from bad company, and at the &s;ame time to incite them, by the mo&s;t animated exhortations, to &s;anctity of life, no great objection can lie again&s;t it; but the &s;ummer diver&s;ion cannot be looked upon with equal indulgence. Near Prince <HI>Doria's</HI> palace, without S. <HI>Thomas's</HI> gate, the&s;e monks have a gar|den,
<PB N="200" REF="237">
with a beautiful edifice in it, where every Sun|day, in the afternoon, they permit &s;everal kinds of games, as drafts, che&s;s, billiards; dice and cards are excepted. It is true, they do not play here for money, but for <HI>ave maria's, pater-no&s;ters,</HI> and other prayers; and at the breaking up of a party, the lo&s;ers kneel before an image of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and there, according to their lo&s;ings, di&s;charge them&s;elves to her, or to God, by <HI>pater-no&s;ters,</HI> &amp;c. In the evening they leave off playing, and an ora|torio is performed; next comes a &s;piritual exhorta|tion, and at length this medley of levity and reli|gion clo&s;es with a &s;olemn piece of mu&s;ic. The intent, indeed, is far from culpable, being to divert the commonalty from riotous meetings; and an exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s for gaming is gratified without prejudice to their &s;ub&s;tance and families: but how this abu&s;e of God's name, in the&s;e lo&s;t prayers, can be ju&s;tified is a my&s;tery.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the police of this city, the <HI>Sbirri</HI> at Genoa are pretty much like our con&s;tables; they al&s;o execute all arre&s;ts, collect the taxes, and guard the port. They are abhorred by the people, pro|tected by the great and by what is called here the <HI>Prince,</HI> which means the Government. The of|ficers of ju&s;tice here appear in as infamous a light as the hangmen in France. The meane&s;t wretch of
<PB N="201" REF="238">
Genoa would deem it a di&s;grace to marry the daughter or &s;i&s;ter of a <HI>Sbirri.</HI> They can even have no &s;ociety but with their own fraternity, it being ignominious for their neighbours to a&s;&s;ociate with them. It frequently happens that the females of the&s;e <HI>Sbirri</HI> are remarkably hand&s;ome, and that their beauty procures them the particular attention and protection of the nobles, &s;carce one of whom but what has a favourite mi&s;tre&s;s among them: The&s;e men run great ri&s;ks in the execution of their office; 10 or 12 of them, at lea&s;t, are killed every year by the populace. Sixty livres is the allowance for each arre&s;t. At the approach of night they walk the &s;treets in &s;mall parties, to prevent a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nations, which are not uncommon in Genoa. It is ab&s;olutely forbidden that any per&s;on &s;hould carry a <HI>&s;tilletto</HI> concealed about him. Therefore when the <HI>Sbirri</HI> meet a &s;u&s;picious per&s;on they &s;urround him immediately, and &s;troke him down the &s;ides and hips, to di&s;cover if he has one about him. Should they find one, he is hurried away to pri&s;on, and there detained &s;ix months, even if his character be unimpeachable; otherwi&s;e he is &s;ent to the gal|lies for life, or for a con&s;iderable term of years. Notwith&s;tanding this ordinance of government, there is &s;carce a Genoe&s;e who does not po&s;&s;e&s;s and carry one about him. This deadly in&s;trument makes its way at one &s;troke through the ribs, the
<PB N="202" REF="239">
&s;pine of the back, or the &s;houlder blades, &s;o well is the &s;teel tempered. The mo&s;t dreadful accidents, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> in contradiction to <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> fre|quently happen in the &s;treets; for on receiving the &s;lighte&s;t provocation the&s;e weapons make their ap|pearance; they a&s;&s;ail each other with great ferocity, and no unconcerned &s;pectator ever interpo&s;es, fear|ing a momentary re&s;entment of either combatant might prove fatal to him; and even though one of them &s;hould fall, no one ever thinks of pur&s;uing or &s;topping the murderer; a <HI>culpo di coltello,</HI> that is, a &s;tab with a knife, is looked upon here as a black eye or a bloody no&s;e in England. Another rea&s;on why &s;pectators do not interpo&s;e is, that the family of the guilty per&s;on are implacable towards an in|former; and never fail to requite his officiou&s;ne&s;s &s;ooner or later with a like return. The manner in which the guilty a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;ecures him&s;elf is by going immediately on board a foreign &s;hip in the harbour, where he remains in &s;afety till the accident is forgot. If the wound is but &s;light, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in never thinks even of going on &s;hip-board, but walks off to the neare&s;t church, where in the portico, or on the &s;teps, he is in &s;afety; but if the wound proves mortal, the church no longer affords him an a&s;ylum, and he can then be taken even from on &s;hip-board. The churches are al&s;o very convenient for all pilferers, who are there in &s;ecurity from the <HI>Sbirri;</HI> but in the ca&s;e
<PB N="203" REF="240">
of highway-robbers, hou&s;e-breakers, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, an order is procured from the archbi&s;hop, authori&s;|ing the civil power to take them from thence.</P>

<P>THE Genoe&s;e are e&s;teemed extremely cunning, indu&s;trious, and inured to hard&s;hip above the re&s;t of the Italians; which was likewi&s;e the charac|ter of their ance&s;tors, the old Ligurians. The Ita|lian proverb &s;ays, of the Genoe&s;e, that 'they have a &s;ea without fi&s;h, land without trees, women with|out mode&s;ty, and men without faith.'</P>
<P>It is true, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> that the Tyrrhene &s;ea does not greatly abound in fi&s;h, and the rocky tops of the Ligurian mountains are not much &s;haded by firs and oaks. But integrity in men and mode&s;ty in women are quite as common, throughout the Ge|noe&s;e country, as el&s;ewhere. The Genoe&s;e nobles are in general affable, polite, and very knowing;
<PB N="204" REF="241">
and their great ladies much better acquainted with books than any other &s;et of Italian ladies. They all pique them&s;elves on &s;peaking Italian and French with great correctne&s;s, and men may conver&s;e in their hearing on the belle-lettres, and even on trade and politics, without any breach of civility; which would not be the ca&s;e in almo&s;t all other parts of Italy.</P>
<P>With regard to the common people, the Genoe&s;e are the mo&s;t laborious and indu&s;trious of any nation whatever. Nor are they wanting in bravery, as the Germans experienced to their co&s;t in the la&s;t Italian war, when that army which had defeated 40 or 50,000 French at Placentia, was by the Genoe&s;e populace impetuou&s;ly attacked, routed, and put to a mo&s;t ignominious flight.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e, from their commerce with other nations, &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> are very quick of ap|prehen&s;ion, gue&s;&s;ing at what you would &s;ay, however ill you may expre&s;s your&s;elf. Nor do they think a &s;tranger ridiculous for not &s;peaking their language fluently; ra&s;hly confounding words and ideas, and &s;uppo&s;ing the want or mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of the for|mer, to proceed from a defect or confu&s;ion in the latter. In dealing with a Genoe&s;e the bargain is
<PB N="205" REF="242">
&s;oon concluded; for they &s;eldom a&s;k more than they mean to take, and are a people of few words.</P>
<P>The law of gain is &s;o prevalent here, that all ranks give into trade. The laws have taken care, in many articles, to put a check upon exce&s;&s;ive &s;plendor and luxury. Foreigners, and the eight coun&s;ellors of &s;tate, excepted, no per&s;on is to be at|tended by above one footman; and &s;he mu&s;t be a lady of con&s;iderable rank, who, be&s;ides &s;uch an at|tendant, is allowed a page; and he mu&s;t not exceed 14 years of age.</P>
<P>It &s;eems little to agree with the re&s;erve and mo|de&s;ty of the fair-&s;ex, that mo&s;t of the married ladies of di&s;tinction are every where attended by a gentle|man, who in the &s;treets walks before their chair, and at coming into the church holds the holy water for them, and does all the other little acts of com|plai&s;ance, in a particular manner like a lover. Some ladies are not &s;atisfied with one &s;uch ob&s;equi|ous dangler, but admit &s;everal for di&s;tinct offices; one attends his lady when &s;he goes abroad, another provides for the table, another has the management of parties of plea&s;ure, a fourth regulates the gaming table, a fifth is even con&s;ulted about receipts and di&s;bur&s;ements; and both the beauty and wit of a lady are commonly rated according to the number
<PB N="206" REF="243">
of the&s;e votaries. They all pa&s;s under the denomi|nation of <HI>Platonic</HI> lovers; and one would, indeed, almo&s;t imagine, the hu&s;bands had nothing to fear from all the&s;e familiarities; for the Genoe&s;e being true Italians in point of jealou&s;y, can not be igno|rant how far the&s;e intimacies may be carried, as they, in their turn, are <HI>cici&s;bei</HI> to other married la|dies. Nor is this piece of gallantry confined to the young women only, but ladies advanced in years, pique them&s;elves much on having their <HI>cici&s;beo;</HI> however this cu&s;tom is merely arbitrary, there being no indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation here to ob&s;erve it, and it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, now &s;eems to be on the decline.</P>
<P>A very &s;triking in&s;tance of the &s;incerity of their attachment, notwith&s;tanding the ridicule thrown on them, is related in the hi&s;tory of the wars of Genoa, which we have made the &s;ubject of a plate. <HI>Donna Thoma&s;a</HI> (a lady of one of the noble&s;t families of Genoa) having by her good offices contributed to appea&s;e the wrath of <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. &s;he cho&s;e him for her <HI>cavalier &s;ervante,</HI> the monarch repaying her at|tachment to him with a mutual return of love. This &s;o won upon her affections, that on a report which prevailed in Italy of his death, &s;he immedi|ately &s;ecluded her&s;elf from all &s;ociety, and had a mau&s;oleum erected in her palace, to which &s;he re|tired every day for many hours, to give free vent to

her grief, in meditating on her decea&s;ed friend. When &s;he died the Republic thought them&s;elves &s;o much indebted to her good offices with this mo|narch, that they ordered her a public funeral at the expence of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The Genoe&s;e nobility are great economi&s;ts; and may be worth generally from one to 5000 pounds a year; though few of them have a revenue equal to this latter &s;um, except the families of <HI>Durazzo</HI> and <HI>Doria.</HI> They live with great par&s;imony in their fa|milies, and wear nothing but black in public; &s;o that their expences are but &s;mall. If a Genoe&s;e no|bleman gives an entertainment once a quarter, he is &s;aid to live upon the fragments all the re&s;t of the year. I was told, &s;ays <HI>Smollett,</HI> that one of them lately invited his friends, and left the entertainment to the care of his &s;on, who ordered a di&s;h of fi&s;h that co&s;t a <HI>zechin,</HI> equal to about ten &s;hillings in Engli&s;h. The old gentleman no &s;ooner &s;aw it ap|pear on the table, than unable to &s;uppre&s;s his con|cern, he bur&s;t into tears, and exclaimed, Ah! <HI>fi|gliuolo indegno! Siamo in rovina! Siamo in precipizio!</HI> Oh! gracele&s;s &s;on; we are ruined! we are ruined!</P>
<P>The pride and o&s;tentation of the Italians in gene|ral, however, may be &s;aid to take a more laudable turn than that of other nations. A Frenchman lays
<PB N="208" REF="246">
out his whole revenue upon tawdry &s;uits of cloaths, or in furni&s;hing a magnificent entertainment of 50 or a 100 covers, one half of which are not eatable, nor intended to be eaten. His wardrobe goes to the <HI>fripier;</HI> his di&s;hes to the dogs, and him&s;elf to the devil; and after his decea&s;e no ve&s;tige of him remains. A Genoe&s;e, on the other hand, keeps him|&s;elf and his family on &s;hort allowance, that he may &s;ave money to build palaces and churches, which remain to after ages as &s;o many monuments of his ta&s;te, piety, and munificence; and in the mean time give bread and employment to the poor and indu&s;|trious. There are &s;ome Genoe&s;e nobles who have each five or &s;ix elegant palaces, magnificently fur|ni&s;hed, either in the city or in different parts of the environs along the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes at Genoa are in general per&s;onable and hand&s;ome, and affect the French dre&s;s to the utmo&s;t extent of the &s;umptuary laws, by which men are al|lowed only to wear black, with a &s;hort &s;attin cloak, and their &s;edans cour&s;ely varni&s;hed with black. The &s;ame laws prohibit women from pearls, diamonds, and laces. Their carriage is the &s;ame as that of men; and all their light after dark, is a &s;orry lan|thern, on one of the poles of the leading chairman. The only per&s;ons di&s;pen&s;ed from the&s;e rigid laws are the <HI>&s;po&s;e,</HI> or &s;uch as are promi&s;ed in marriage; and
<PB N="209" REF="247">
this for &s;ix weeks before and after their nuptials. In this happy interval their love of finery has its full range; they go in gilded chairs, &s;plendidly glazed, with white wax flambeaux before and behind; and in the riche&s;t full dre&s;&s;es, glittering with jewels and laces. During this tran&s;ient period, it is the &s;ame with them as with young women about taking the veil, who are led to the pari&s;h church in all the pomp and glitter which their family can furni&s;h.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the <HI>bourgeois,</HI> &s;ays Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> is fine, but &s;ingular. Their heads are wrapped up in a piece of printed cotton, which looks like a coun|terpane; it reaches down to their wai&s;ts, and rolling it round them, they fold their arms over the ends, bringing it &s;o clo&s;e together before, that &s;carce any part of their faces can be &s;een. They have &s;trait bodied gowns, with very long trains of rich &s;atins, dama&s;ks, &amp;c. the&s;e they do not give them&s;elves the trouble to hold out of the dirt; &s;o their tails &s;weep up all the ordure of the &s;treets. They generally wear long aprons of fine mu&s;lins trimmed with lace.</P>
<P>The poorer &s;ort of women and pea&s;ants are wretchedly cloathed; they wear a petticoat of wool|len or &s;triped linen, with a <HI>cor&s;et;</HI> their heads are quite naked, the hair of the <HI>chignion</HI> rolled round
<PB N="210" REF="248">
and round at the top of the back of the head, and &s;everal pewter bodkins, as long as &s;kewers, &s;tuck through it by way of ornament.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething very &s;hocking, remarks Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> in being &s;erved entirely by men, till cu&s;tom and nece&s;&s;ity, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, reconcile one to it. Not a female is to be &s;een in an Italian inn. Our expences are half a guinea a head per day for eating, and for this they give us three or four di&s;hes. Their con&s;tant u&s;e of oil, even in their &s;oups, and which is &s;eldom good, is extremely di&s;gu&s;ting. The manner of roa&s;ting their meat is &s;ingular; after oiling the meat with a feather, they &s;u&s;pend it over a charcoal fire, until it is become &s;o dry and brittle as to admit of pulverization. Fi&s;h is rarely to be had except on maigre days. The great &s;carcity of fi&s;h, how|ever, according to Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> is not owing to a want of abundance in the gulph, but to a tax upon this article, when expo&s;ed for &s;ale in the markets, which rai&s;es the price to the buyers above that of butchers meat; although that is &s;old at 12 &s;ous the pound; the Genoe&s;e do not eat much meat. The poorer &s;ort e&s;pecially live almo&s;t entirely upon che&s;|nuts and macaroni. Bread is excellent here, but very dear, the corn with which it is made coming from Sicily. Fourteen bakers work night and day the year round. The price of rolls of the &s;ize of
<PB N="211" REF="249">
tho&s;e called French rolls at Bath, is dearer by a halfpenny than in that town.</P>
<P>The inns at Genoa, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> afford but in|different entertainment, and care mu&s;t be taken always to make an agreement for every thing before hand. Their hou&s;es are furni&s;hed with wine from the republic, and in &s;ealed bottles; yet the wine is none of the be&s;t, though it is not adulterated by the landlords. As the whole profit of the latter, ari&s;es only from the empty bottles, he takes care to make it up in other articles. Be&s;ides this monopoly of wine, which all who have none of their own growth, mu&s;t buy from the republic; it is the &s;tate only which deals in corn, none being &s;old in any market, but all bakers mu&s;t apply for it to the public granaries.</P>
<P>At the funerals of &s;ingle per&s;ons, a &s;ort of gar|land, decked with all kinds of artificial flowers, is placed upon the coffin. When per&s;ons of di&s;tinc|tion are buried, the religious fraternities walk in the proce&s;&s;ion, with their white hoods drawn over their faces, carrying wax flambeaux in their hands, which they hold horizontally, that poor boys by catching the wax upon paper as it drops off, may earn a few &s;ous. The intention is doubtle&s;s good; but the &s;ight of &s;o many ragged boys, mingling in the proce&s;&s;ion, is no great ornament to the &s;olemnity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXII.</HI> Of their Government, Revenue, Army, Navy, and Commerce.</HEAD>
<P>THE form of government in this republic, is ari&s;tocratical. The chief is called Doge or Duke, to which dignity, no per&s;on is promoted, till he is 50 years of age, and has for 15 years, left off all trade or occupation, not con&s;i&s;tent with nobility. Every two years, a new Doge is cho&s;en, and the former incapacitated, during five years to hold the &s;ame po&s;t. On the election day, which is u&s;ually the third of January, the great council meets in the ducal palace, and by drawing gilt balls out of a box, 50 per&s;ons are cho&s;en out of the le&s;&s;er council, who write down the names of &s;uch per&s;ons, as they think worthy of being promoted to the ducal office. Upon any irreconcilable di&s;putes in the biennial election, it is adjourned from week to week, and the government is lodged, in the mean time, in the elde&s;t &s;enator. The vote of a poor nobleman, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> is often &s;ecured by 50 or 60 louis dors, and there goes a &s;tory, that once a nece&s;&s;itous nobleman, being to go a journey, was for borrowing a cloak
<PB N="213" REF="251">
of a wealthy member of the &s;ame order, but met with a kind of repul&s;e; and &s;ome time after, com|ing into the &s;enate, when his ill-natured rich neigh|bour who wanted but one to be elected doge, began to &s;olicit and made great promi&s;es for gaining him over, but all was to no purpo&s;e, for the poor &s;enator openly declared, 'That his neighbour had lately &s;uffered him to go a journey without a cloak, and in return, he might for his part, go without a cap.</P>
<P>The Doge re&s;ides in a palace belonging to the republic, with his family, and eight Senators ap|pointed for his council. He has a guard of 200 men allowed him, who are all Germans; their uniform is red, faced with blue; but the re&s;t of the &s;oldiery, which is compo&s;ed of all nations, are cloathed in white, with blue facings. The fir&s;t two days after his election, he wears royal robes, but afterwards, only the &s;carlet gown, common to all the members of the council, Lady <HI>Millar,</HI> in de&s;cribing his ordinary dre&s;s, ob&s;erves, that his robes are crim&s;on velvet, his &s;tockings, &s;hoes, &amp;c. red; and that he wears a &s;quare cap on his head of a crim&s;on colour, with a tuft of flame coloured &s;ilk in the middle. He wears al&s;o a large cravat of lace, with a prodigious perriwig. The procurators and &s;enators have robes of black dama&s;k.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="252">The particulars of his prerogatives are, that with|out his con&s;ent, nothing can be propo&s;ed, nor can any re&s;olutions of the council be of the lea&s;t force. In all important affairs, he makes the fir&s;t motion, gives audience to amba&s;&s;adors, and a&s;&s;embles the colleges. All orders are al&s;o i&s;&s;ued in his name.</P>
<P>During his admini&s;tration, he is &s;tiled Serenit&eacute;; but afterwards has no other title than that of Ex|cellenza, common to all the Senators. The other nobility are &s;tiled Illu&s;tri&s;&s;imi. But titles are what the Italians are lea&s;t &s;paring of.</P>
<P>The great council in Genoa, is compo&s;ed of 400, and the little council of 100. None but nobles, and &s;uch as re&s;ide at Genoa, can be admitted into ei|ther.</P>
<P>The ordinary income of the &s;tate, computed to amount only to about half a million of liri, ari&s;es from the duties on imports and exports. When the&s;e revenues fall &s;hort of the public expences, the &s;tate borrows from the nobles and rich citizens, large &s;ums at a high intere&s;t, on certain pledges, and even a&s;&s;ignments on branches of the public income, which recour&s;e, in 1407, gave ri&s;e to the famous bank of S. George, &s;o called from St. George's church, the place where it formerly held its meetings.
<PB N="215" REF="253">
Its opulence and power are very extraordinary, whole towns, manors, and territories belong to it. It is not only to the republic that this company has ad|vanced large &s;ums, but al&s;o to foreigners, by way of mortgage on lands or public revenues in other &s;tates; but it cannot be &s;aid, that either this bank or the republic, have met with the be&s;t of treatment in the performance of their contracts. In 1746, in order to an&s;wer the demands of the Imperiali&s;ts, it was quite drained and brought to the brink of ruin.</P>
<P>It would have been better for the republic of Genoa, &s;ays <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> if &s;he had followed the ex|ample of her &s;i&s;ter of Venice, in not permitting her nobles to purcha&s;e lands or hou&s;es in the territories of a foreign potentate. For at pre&s;ent, the prin|cipal families among the Genoe&s;e, are in part &s;ub|jects of the kingdom of Naples, by rea&s;on of their e&s;tates which lie in that kingdom. The Neapoli|tans &s;ometimes tax them very high, and are &s;o &s;en|&s;ible of the advantage this gives them over the re|public; that they will not &s;uffer a Neapolitan to buy the lands of a Genoe&s;e, who mu&s;t find a purcha&s;er among his own countrymen, if he has a mind to fell.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="254">Sir John <HI>Millar</HI> ob&s;erves, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Genoe&s;e out of their own territory, are nearly equal to the whole income of that &s;tate. As to their being the mo&s;t likely to give them&s;elves up to Spain or Naples, by rea&s;on of &s;uch tenure, that is unnatural: weak in them&s;elves, and unwarlike, they cannot re&s;i&s;t any one power; but their &s;afety has hitherto depended, and mu&s;t always depend upon the intere&s;t others have, in their continuing a free &s;tate: their acqui&s;ition would too much in|crea&s;e the con&s;equence and influence of any neigh|bouring power. Be&s;ides, what bribe can Spain, Naples, or even France offer to the Genoe&s;e nobi|lity, as an equivalent for their liberty? Can they, out of their own hou&s;es, &s;ee any thing de&s;irable in the palace of kings? Rich in their frugality, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of honours, of power, and con&s;idera|tion, can a noble Genoe&s;e envy the prime mini&s;ter or favourite of any crowned head in Europe?</P>
<P>In times of peace, the republic u&s;ually keeps on foot, a body of 5000 regular troops, namely, 4000 natives; 200 Germans, who form the Doge's life guard; 500 Swi&s;s; 300 Italians; 100 Cor&s;icans, and 100 Bombardiers. Be&s;ides the&s;e, it has al&s;o a militia, which, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, is obliged to take the field. The cavalry it rai&s;es in war-time, amount only to about 600 who are but little &s;er|viceable
<PB N="217" REF="255">
by rea&s;on of the badne&s;s of hor&s;es in this country. In the la&s;t war the republic had no le&s;s than 18,000 men in pay.</P>
<P>The fleet of this Republic, anciently &s;o celebrated for its victories over the Saracens, Pi&s;ane&s;e, Vene|tians, Spaniards, and Turks, and for continuing, a con&s;iderable time, ma&s;ter of Sardinia, Malta, Ma|jorca, Minorca, Candia, Cyprus, and many other i&s;lands and places, in and near the Mediterranean and Archipelago, and even of the Black Sea, the Crim, and other places, is now reduced to &s;ix gal|lies.</P>
<P>Though the Genoe&s;e manufactures are much fal|len &s;hort of the vogue they were formerly in, yet velvet, plu&s;h, and fu&s;tian are &s;till made as well as dama&s;ks, and other &s;ilk &s;tuffs; for which con&s;ider|able quantities of red &s;ilk are imported from Me&s;|&s;ina, and other ports of Sicily: they al&s;o make gold and &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ues, laces and gloves; but inferior to tho&s;e of France and the Netherlands. The other Genoe&s;e merchandize con&s;i&s;ts of oil, fruit, Parme&s;an chee&s;e, anchovies, and drugs, which la&s;t are brought from the Levant. With the&s;e goods a bri&s;k trade is carried on, e&s;pecially to Spain. Ships of mo&s;t European nations are con&s;tantly &s;een at Genoa, which is al&s;o the great mart for the trade of Lom|bardy.
<PB N="218" REF="256">
The revenues principally ari&s;e from the manufactures and trade, but the &s;tate is far from making by them the figure it formerly did; and the rea&s;ons are obvious, con&s;idering the increa&s;e and improvement of manufactures in other coun|tries, the dearne&s;s of the Genoe&s;e, and the dangers of the harbour. Genoa is noted for the riche&s;t bankers in Europe, acquiring wealth by dealing in bills of exchange.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIII.</HI> Review of the Manners and Cu&s;toms of the Italians in general, particularly in their private Life, their Games and Pa&s;times.</HEAD>
<P>IN peru&s;ing the books of travellers we are natu|rally led, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> to expect an account of the dome&s;tic life of the people whom they have vi&s;ited; few of them, however, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able requi&s;ite towards the perfor|mance of this ta&s;k; that is, a competent knowledge of the language of the country they vi&s;it; they can|not
<PB N="219" REF="257">
therefore ea&s;ily be admitted by the natives to that familiarity of intercour&s;e, which might afford them &s;ufficient opportunities to make remarks on their private life.</P>
<P>We will endeavour to relate a few facts in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t the reader in forming an idea of the manner in which life is commonly pa&s;&s;ed among the Ita|lians.</P>
<P>Among people in the highe&s;t ranks of life, as well as among tho&s;e who pretend to be much con|ver&s;ant with books, there are in all countries many who profe&s;s to be dei&s;ts and athei&s;ts; and of the&s;e I have rea&s;ons for &s;aying, there are &s;ome in almo&s;t all our cities and towns of Italy: but as their number is not very con&s;iderable, when compared with the ma&s;s of the people, and as mo&s;t of them conform in outward appearance to the e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of wor&s;hip, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to notice them particu|larly, and point out the methods &s;ome of them have taken by means of the pre&s;s, to &s;pread their pernicious doctrines through the country.</P>
<P>This little preamble leads me to ob&s;erve that, in general, when a true Italian ri&s;es in the morning, the fir&s;t action he performs is that of cro&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf, and &s;aying his prayers by his bed-&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="258">The&s;e prayers commonly con&s;i&s;t of a <HI>paterno&s;ter,</HI> an <HI>ave maria,</HI> and an <HI>angele dei,</HI> with the addition of the ten commandments, and the five of the church.</P>
<P>As we are all brought up in the habit of &s;aying the&s;e prayers to our mothers and nur&s;es, who make it a point to din them in our ears every morning, even before we can well &s;peak; it may be ea&s;ily believed there are few among us who leave off the cu&s;tom, even when infancy is pa&s;&s;ed; as we are further confirmed in it by our ma&s;ters at &s;chool, and our catechi&s;ts at church, who ince&s;&s;antly re|commend and inculcate to young people the indi&s;|pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of this duty. Breakfa&s;t is with them very different according to the age and con|dition of people. Young per&s;ons are &s;eldom or ever permitted to drink any thing hot in a morn|ing, as is u&s;ual in England. Their breakfa&s;t is dry bread, or bread and chee&s;e, or bread and fruit, &s;uch as the &s;ea&s;on affords. Nor are they permitted to drink coffee and chocolate, which are taken for breakfa&s;t by all people of fa&s;hion: it being a preva|lent idea in Italy, that any thing hot in a morning ruins the teeth of young per&s;ons, and weakens their con&s;titution.</P>
<P>As to the generality of pea&s;ants and working peo|ple, they make their breakfa&s;t of <HI>polenta,</HI> a kind of
<PB N="221" REF="259">
pudding, made with the flour of Turkey corn, on which, whil&s;t it is hot, they &s;pread &s;ome fre&s;h but|ter, with the addition of a &s;lice of chee&s;e, and a few walnuts, if they can afford it. Tea, is never &s;een among the lower order of people. Ladies of fa&s;hion u&s;ed formerly to drink a &s;mall ba&s;on only when troubled with a cold; but its u&s;e is gradually creeping in among the better &s;ort of people, e&s;pe|cially in the maritime towns.</P>
<P>The Italians are in general very early ri&s;ers, e&s;pe|cially in &s;ummer. A great many who have no country hou&s;es, in which they &s;pend that &s;ea&s;on, go very often at &s;un-ri&s;e with their whole family to breakfa&s;t in the fields at &s;ome di&s;tance from the towns. There they carry cold meat, &s;au&s;ages, chee&s;e, fruit, and wine, &s;pread a napkin on the gra&s;s, near &s;ome brook or &s;pring, and make a mo&s;t chearful meal; and then, before the heat of the &s;un becomes inten&s;e, return home to their re&s;pective occupations: this morning exerci&s;e is e&s;teemed by them very &s;alutary and nece&s;&s;ary, e&s;pecially for chil|dren. This cu&s;tom, however, prevails only among the middle cla&s;s of people, and does not extend to tho&s;e of high rank, who live in Italy nearly after the &s;ame manner with their equals in other coun|tries, always breakfa&s;ting at home, except &s;ome|times
<PB N="222" REF="260">
for a frolic when they are at their country &s;eats.</P>
<P>Though, in the Sardinian dominions, every per&s;on from the King to the meane&s;t pea&s;ant, dines ex|actly at 12 o'clock, yet in other parts of Italy it is the cu&s;tom to dine two or three hours later. The place of di&s;tinction is the &s;eat farthe&s;t di&s;tant from the door, at which the victuals are brought in; and this place is generally allotted to the olde&s;t female in company, or to a &s;tranger. All the re&s;t, both men and women, &s;eat them&s;elves promi&s;cuou&s;ly. The trouble of carving is not left to the ladies as in England. At the tables of per&s;ons in a middling &s;phere of life the men carve; and at tho&s;e of peo|ple of fa&s;hion there is generally a &s;ervant out of livery, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to carve at the &s;ideboard for the company. A common dinner begins with a French &s;oup, and &s;ometimes with a large di&s;h of rice, macaroni, or legumes; then follow the boiled meats; after them the roa&s;t meats; and la&s;t of all the chee&s;e and fruit; nor is it u&s;ual to dine in any other order. People of fa&s;hion have their French cooks as in England, and their dinners are nearly upon the &s;ame &s;cale with people of rank in all the different courts of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="261">The ladies in general drink nothing but water at their meals; but the men take two or three large tumblers of wine during meals: it is not the cu&s;tom to drink to the health of any per&s;on, whe|ther pre&s;ent or ab&s;ent, except a foreigner be in|vited. In that ca&s;e, healths are drank once or twice, in compliment to the cu&s;tom of foreigners, with which every one is acquainted. Healths are al&s;o drank at bridal dinners, in favour of the new married couple.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as dinner is over, every thing on the table, except the cloth, is removed, and liquors are brought, of which there are a great many kinds made in Italy; and the&s;e, when the &s;ervants have dined, are &s;ucceeded by coffee. In tho&s;e parts of Italy where the winter is very cold, a fire is kept under the table all the time of dinner, and I re|member the time, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> when it was u&s;ual in &s;ummer for every gue&s;t to have water to put his feet in, during the time of dinner, but this &s;trange cu&s;tom is now left off.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer, almo&s;t every one goes to &s;leep for an hour or two after dinner, either in an ea&s;y chair or on a bed. For this rea&s;on it is not the cu&s;tom to dre&s;s before dinner as in England; but people ge|nerally eat their dinners in their banians or morn|ing
<PB N="224" REF="262">
gowns; and when they have been obliged to dre&s;s after breakfa&s;t, in order to go out, they un|dre&s;s again to be more at their ea&s;e at table: but this cu&s;tom does not extend to the nobility or peo|ple of condition, who have long adopted the cu&s;|tom of &s;itting down to table full dre&s;&s;ed, which &s;ub|jects them to the inconvenience of dre&s;&s;ing again, if they &s;leep after dinner.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer time, few people like to &s;tay at home in the evening, but as &s;oon as the &s;un begins to ap|proach the horizon, women, as well as men, go out to walk till night, as many together as po&s;&s;ible for the &s;ake of conver&s;ation. Their place of re&s;ort is that where the great people are taking the air in their coaches. This promenade u&s;ually la&s;ts for an hour or &s;o after &s;un &s;et. When their walk is fini&s;h|ed, they return home to &s;upper, which always begins with &s;ome &s;ort of &s;allad, and ends with fruit. After &s;upper they again go out and walk, the nobility excepted, who repair to &s;ome hou&s;e where there is a <HI>conver&s;azione.</HI> Tho&s;e who go out after &s;upper, ramble through the &s;treets, in large parties, and enjoy the fre&s;h air, li&s;tening to the mu&s;ic and &s;inging of tho&s;e who divert them&s;elves and their friends with their <HI>&s;erenades,</HI> of which there are &s;everal, every fine evening, in all the great towns. Thus, the &s;treets are more thronged by

night than in the day. This kind of diver&s;ion ge|nerally la&s;ts till midnight, and often till one or two in the morning; the&s;e parties then break up, and people return home, repeat the prayers of the morning, and retire to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Such is the u&s;ual tenor of life in Italy. Few Ita|lians amu&s;e them&s;elves at any kind of play in &s;um|mer: but in winter they beguile their cold and long evenings with cards; and in the ea&s;tern parts of Italy with che&s;s, backgammon, tric-trac, and other &s;uch like games. Of their games with cards, which are peculiar to this country, we &s;hall hereafter &s;peak.</P>
<P>An Italian, though but one degree above the vulgar, never &s;ets down to table, without having previou&s;ly wa&s;hed his hands, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer: and the water, for this purpo&s;e, is admini&s;tered by a &s;ervant. No water-gla&s;&s;es are u&s;ed in Italy after meals, as in England; but if any per&s;on chu&s;es to wa&s;h his hands or mouth, he quits the table and retires to another part of the room.</P>
<P>As for the article of food, there are not many &s;ingularities to notice, excepting that few Italians can endure beef at their tables. Many Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, at the Italian courts, and many of the
<PB N="226" REF="264">
Engli&s;h dome&s;ticated in the country, admiring the beef in Italy, have endeavoured to bring the eating of it into vogue, and would per&s;uade the Italians to eat it roa&s;ted. One nobleman had the good nature to &s;end for a butcher from England to &s;hew tho&s;e of Turin how to cut up an ox. Yet his en|deavours proved fruitle&s;s, nor was he able to re|move the fooli&s;h prejudice, that beef is gro&s;s food, fit only for the common people, by whom alone it is eaten except &s;ome of the choice pieces, u&s;ed for <HI>bouilli;</HI> nor will the common people eat it roa&s;ted, but either boil, &s;tew, or make it into pies, highly &s;ea&s;oned with pepper, garlic, onion and other &s;trong ingredients.</P>
<P>Salted beef is di&s;liked even more than roa&s;ted; nor is &s;alt meat of any kind ever brought to polite tables except tongues and &s;au&s;ages. The princi|pal meat is veal, and though in &s;ome places it is eaten young, yet in general the calves are not killed till they are &s;ix or &s;even months old. Pork is in great e&s;teem, and reckoned excellent as well by foreigners as by the inhabitants; and there are fowls of all kinds in abundance, both tame and wild. Kid and lamb are frequently eaten, but mutton very &s;eldom; becau&s;e in general it is not good in any part of Italy, except that which comes from Switzerland, and the upper
<PB N="227" REF="265">
part of the Appennines. The common people eat mutton bred in the level part of Italy, and it any per&s;on above the vulgar, has a mind, for the &s;ake of variety, to a leg or &s;houlder, it is always roa&s;ted, and plentifully &s;tuffed with garlic, &s;age and ro&s;e|mary. Large joints of meats are never &s;erved up at Italian tables, except in families numerous enough to con&s;ume the whole in a day; and for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e in countries where the heat for many months is &s;o great, it does not an&s;wer to keep victuals for the following day.</P>
<P>On meagre days, which by the bye, are declin|ing very fa&s;t in Italy, the &s;ea, lakes, rivers, and fi&s;h-ponds, furni&s;h mo&s;t of the cities with great variety of fi&s;h; as the gardens and fields do with vegetables, which the Italian cooks dre&s;s in &s;everal very palatable ways, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of butter, chee&s;e, &s;pices, anchovies, capers, and other in|gredients, and particularly mu&s;hrooms and truffles; which many provinces of Italy afford in abundance, and of the mo&s;t delicate kind. Great quantities of &s;alt-fi&s;h are al&s;o eaten in Lent, dre&s;&s;ed in different ways not known in England.</P>
<P>Potatoes are not eat in this country. Such is the repugnance that the generality of mankind have to eat what they are not accu&s;tomed to, that the
<PB N="228" REF="266">
captain of an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, who brought a large cargo of potatoes to Naples, during a great famine, was obliged to throw them overboard; as he could not find per&s;ons who would accept them even as a pre&s;ent. And yet there are &s;everal little nations, if they may be &s;o called along the ridges of the Apennines, who eat &s;carce any thing el&s;e for a great part of the year, except che&s;nuts, of which they make even bread; and many of the pea&s;ants in other parts, live almo&s;t entirely on <HI>polenta.</HI></P>
<P>When the Italians have taken their afternoon nap, their &s;ervants attend them with lemonade, and other cooling drinks kept in ice. Of the&s;e they drink plentifully not only then, but at all hours of the day; nor do they want the&s;e refre&s;h|ments, great quantities of ice and &s;now, being pre&s;erved in every part of Italy for the hot months. Should there be a &s;carcity of them, which happens but &s;eldom, the inhabitants lament it almo&s;t as much as a famine. At Venice where it would be difficult to have ice-hou&s;es under ground, on ac|count of the &s;ea, ice is brought every evening from the continent: and there are laws, obliging per|&s;ons who keep coffee-hou&s;es, to provide the town with &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an article; as it would much di&s;tre&s;s labouring people, could they not cool the wine at their meals with ice, and quench their
<PB N="229" REF="267">
thir&s;t as often as they have occa&s;ion with ice water.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the morning prayers, of the Italians, we will now give &s;ome account of the manner in which they acquit them&s;elves, of tho&s;e duties, impo&s;ed on them by their religion. Like the Engli&s;h, the Italians are not very fond of going to church on week-days; yet there are &s;ome women e&s;pecially, who go to hear ma&s;s every morning, and receive the benediction in the evening.</P>
<P>Many of our readers know, or may ea&s;ily in|form them&s;elves, what ma&s;&s;es and benedictions are; it will therefore be &s;uperfluous to de&s;cribe them. We have likewi&s;e, already related how magnificent the churches of Italy are. On holi|days, before day-break, their bells are in motion, and the lower cla&s;s of people, running to hear ma&s;s. As every church has at lea&s;t three altars, and the prie&s;ts and friars are numerous; &s;o there are in all churches ma&s;&s;es to be heard, from the very fir&s;t appearance of the morning, till towards the afternoon.</P>
<P>A little after ten, the genteel people begin to make their appearance; the ladies attended by
<PB N="230" REF="268">
their &s;ervants and gallants. A gallant who e&s;corts his lady to church, on approaching the door, &s;teps forward to hold up the curtain, placed within the entrance, and advances to the holy water, into which he dips the extremity of his middle finger, and offers it to her, that &s;he may cro&s;s her&s;elf, which &s;he immediately does, not forgetting to re|turn him her thanks, by a half curte&s;y.</P>
<P>In the Italian churches are no pews; only benches or chairs, and for the double purpo&s;e of &s;it|ting or kneeling. In tho&s;e churches, where there are only chairs, the &s;ervants or &s;exton gives one to any lady or gentleman. But where there are only benches, a lady immediately goes where &s;he &s;ees a place vacant, or if all are occupied, where a man is &s;eated. On the approach of a woman, though but tolerably dre&s;&s;ed, and no matter what may be her age, a man immediately ri&s;es, and gives up his place to her. She kneels for an in&s;tant, cro&s;&s;es her&s;elf; mumbles over a &s;hort prayer, generally an <HI>ave maria;</HI> and if there be no ma&s;s going forward at any of the altars, &s;its down till one begins. But if there is one ju&s;t ready to commence, &s;he continues kneeling, till it is a little advanced; then &s;its; and kneels no more, till &s;he hears the little bell ring, when the prie&s;t elevates the ho&s;t.
<PB N="231" REF="269">
Her kneeling at this in&s;tant, is accompanied with a very humble attitude, and an air of recollection.</P>
<P>When this ma&s;s is over, &s;he &s;its &s;till a while, then kneels again; mutters another <HI>ave maria,</HI> or &s;ome other &s;hort prayer, cro&s;&s;es her&s;elf, takes up the prayer-book, in which &s;he has been reading the greate&s;t part of the ma&s;s, gives it to her &s;ervant or gallant, cro&s;&s;es her&s;elf again; curte&s;ies to the great altar, then goes to the holy water, and after again cro&s;&s;ing her&s;elf, curte&s;ies a &s;econd time to the altar, and then walks out of church, if &s;he has no further bu&s;ine&s;s in it; that is, if &s;he does not go to confe&s;s, which devout ladies make a rule to do once a month.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the men, they generally &s;tand, while they are at church, e&s;pecially the young and gay; and only bend the right knee a little, and in|cline the head, at the elevation of the ho&s;t; and what is &s;till le&s;s exemplary, often whi&s;per to each other, and make their remarks on the ladies, who come in and go out. For this, they are upbraided in due time by the Lent Preachers, who point out to them the &s;candal they offer to religion, by &s;uch prepo&s;terous conduct, and remark to them the great decorum ob&s;erved even by Turks and heretics, in their acts of devotion.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="270">Though the churches as well as the ma&s;&s;es are numerous, yet &s;ome are a&s;toni&s;hingly crouded on holidays; it being the cu&s;tom, for no per&s;on to ab|&s;ent him&s;elf from church on a holiday, not even tho&s;e, who make light of religion; it being one of the &s;ettled modes for filling up of time. In all the great towns there are two or three churches called <HI>alla moda</HI> (fa&s;hionable) in which the be&s;t company is collected a little before noon.</P>
<P>Contrary to the cu&s;tom of the French, who are fond of re&s;orting in an aftertoon to ve&s;pers, the Italians do not attend them. But they croud in the evening to the benediction, which is rendered a mo&s;t glorious &s;ight by the immen&s;e &s;plendor of lights, and &s;olemnity of &s;hort prayers &s;et to mu&s;ic, and the great concour&s;e of people of fa&s;hion. This la&s;t is an inducement not to be pa&s;&s;ed unno|ticed, as the Italians never like to go to any place not vi&s;ited by the ladies. The prie&s;ts and friars, know very well how to fill their churches with ladies, at a benediction, by giving them &s;ome fine piece of mu&s;ic, as they return from their evening walk, to the opera, the conver&s;azione, or the play. The prie&s;ts, by thus filling the church, are &s;ure to make it turn to their advantage, as they have one or two per&s;ons going round the church collecting alms by
<PB N="233" REF="271">
means of a bag, fa&s;tened to the end of a long pole.</P>
<P>Few of the very great people are &s;carce ever &s;een at church, they having chapels of their own. This privilege they ea&s;ily obtain from Rome, at a very &s;mall expence: and when they have a chapel, &s;ome poor prie&s;t is &s;oon found, who for a few pence will come to &s;ay ma&s;s to them, any morning they chu&s;e.</P>
<P>Such is the general manner, of &s;pending a holi|day in Italy, with re&s;pect to the religious duties attending it. There is no need of ob&s;erving, that this account regards only, what is called, the polite part of the nation. As to the lower cla&s;s of people, they are in general &s;trict followers of &s;uch modes of wor&s;hip as are pre&s;cribed to them by their eccle|&s;ia&s;tical &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>It requires the talents of a painter, rather than a writer, to give clear idea of the variety of dre&s;&s;es, in the &s;everal parts of Italy. This variety however, appears more in the dre&s;s of the women, than of the men; and that of the women too, of the lower rank. The men throughout Italy, dre&s;s, as in mo&s;t other parts, except the Nobles of Venice and Genoa, who&s;e habits are peculiar to them&s;elves,
<PB N="234" REF="272">
and to tho&s;e few among their &s;ubjects in each town, who have the privilege of dre&s;&s;ing like them. Their dre&s;s we have already noticed, in our account of tho&s;e two republican &s;tates. At Rome the bet|ter &s;ort of people, and even married men, dre&s;s for the greater part like abbots: and the&s;e are all the deviations from the common fa&s;hion, ob&s;ervable in Italy among the men. But with regard to the women, it is not an ea&s;y ta&s;k to de&s;cribe the pecu|liar fa&s;hions of their dre&s;s in different cities. In &s;ome parts the women cover only their head; in others their head and &s;houlders, in others again, all the upper part of the body; and &s;ome their whole figure, from head to foot. In &s;ome places the women cover their gowns from the wai&s;t down|ward with a black petticoat, as if they wi&s;hed to conceal the richne&s;s or elegance of their dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Gentlemen throughout Italy, in the &s;ummer months, dre&s;s in the thinne&s;t &s;ilks, and wear velvet in winter, be&s;ides cloth of different kinds and colours; and very much laced and embroidered by tho&s;e who can afford it, the Italians being as fond of finery as the French. In winter they al&s;o line their coats with expen&s;ive furs, and in many parts, when young, adorn their hats with feathers. They likewi&s;e wear large muffs. The men wear &s;words in all parts of Italy, except Venice, where
<PB N="235" REF="273">
the narrowne&s;s of the &s;treets and the gondolas would make them inconvenient. Even &s;trangers at Venice, leave their &s;words at home, and put on a cloak.</P>
<P>The poore&s;t pea&s;antry in many parts of Italy, wear neither hat, cravat, &s;tockings, nor &s;hoes; nay in &s;ome of the &s;outhern provinces, they only put on a coar&s;e unbuttoned &s;hirt and trow&s;ers in &s;ummer, and wear a very ordinary coat in winter, but &s;till go bare-legged. Yet it is ob&s;ervable, that upon the whole they are much larger limbed, and better made than the Piedmonte&s;e, Lombards, and Venetians, who cloath them&s;elves much better. The Apulians, and Calabrians e&s;pecially, are &s;poken of, as the fine&s;t race of men in Europe, taking the word fine in the &s;en&s;e of painters, and not of young ladies.</P>
<P>The Italians are no great fox-hunters. It is not the cu&s;tom in Italy, as in England, to go out a fox-cha&s;ing. Perhaps the winters are too cold, and the &s;ummers too hot, for &s;uch diver&s;ion; or it may be the plains are too narrow, the mountains too &s;teep, and the rivers too rapid, and too many for this exerci&s;e. Yet &s;ome of the Italian princes have their hunting-&s;eats, and &s;ometimes hunt the &s;tag, and the wild boar, and even the wolf. But this
<PB N="236" REF="274">
makes no part of the national character, and in general the Italians are not fond of &s;uch dangerous exerci&s;es. They take more delight in fowling, and laying &s;nares for the feathered creation, in which, perhaps, no nation in Europe is &s;o dexterous as the Italians, who among other inventions for this purpo&s;e, have that of the <HI>Roccolo,</HI> a &s;hort ac|count of which may not be unacceptable.</P>
<P>A Roccolo is a circular piece of ground, gener|ally on an eminence, at &s;ome di&s;tance from any wood. This &s;pot of ground is planted with trees, in a circular direction. The diameter of the circle may be about thirty or forty feet. The&s;e trees are covered on one &s;ide with a net, which remains upon them, as long as the &s;porting time la&s;ts. The area within the circle is al&s;o planted with trees of a le&s;s &s;ize, and has in its center, a green bu&s;hy hut, containing many cages full of thru&s;hes, bull-finches, chaff-finches, and &s;uch kinds of &s;mall birds. A little di&s;tance from the&s;e cages, there is an owl placed, which has been long u&s;ed to eat his food perching on a &s;hort pole, the upper end of which is formed into a kind of &s;mall cu&s;hion, &s;tuffed with rags or &s;traw.</P>
<P>On one &s;ide of the circular row of trees a tower is built, about 20 feet high, the brick work of which,
<PB N="237" REF="275">
is concealed by leaves and branches of vine, ivy, and other creeping plants.</P>
<P>At that &s;ea&s;on of the year, when birds are on their pa&s;&s;age to other countries, the <HI>Roccoli&s;ta;</HI> that is the man who owns a Roccolo, a&s;cends the tower two or three hours before &s;un-ri&s;e. At the top is a &s;mall room where he &s;tands; and from the window he keeps a &s;harp look-out, towards that part of the horizon, from whence the birds come. As &s;oon as he &s;ees or hears any, he gives a jirk to a long &s;tring fa&s;tened to the leg of the owl, in the green hut below. The owl with this &s;udden jirk falls to the ground, from the pole or cu&s;hion on which he was re&s;ting, but pre&s;ently hops upon it again. The moment however that he falls, he is perceived by the birds in the cage, who gives a &s;ud|den cry, which &s;portmen &s;ay is for joy, pretending that all birds are rejoiced at the &s;ight of the owl. This cry is heard by the birds flying in the air, who all immediately plunge precipitately into the Roc|colo, as if wanting to &s;ee what was the matter. The Roccoli&s;ta who fore&s;ees what will be the con|&s;equence of the &s;hricks made by his little pri&s;oners in the cages, &s;tands prepared with &s;everal &s;hort pieces of wood, to throw them at the flying birds. The&s;e pieces of wood by the means of &s;ome wicker work on each &s;ide, very much re&s;emble a kite on
<PB N="238" REF="276">
the wing. As &s;oon as the birds approach the ground within the area, without giving them time to alight on the branches of the green hut, he throws as quick as po&s;&s;ible &s;everal of his fal&s;e kites over their heads, and thus frightens them; upon which, in order to e&s;cape the mock enemy through the circular trees, they run directly into the net that covers the&s;e trees; and are thus caught in great numbers, &s;ometimes a thou&s;and or more every morning, if their flight was numerous, and the Roccolo in a favourable &s;ituation; nor does the Roccoli&s;ta de&s;cend from the tower, till the &s;un be|comes &s;o powerful as to re&s;train the birds from their flight, and oblige them to &s;eek &s;helter. The lea&s;t noi&s;e in a Roccolo would make the birds keep at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; therefore the Rocco|li&s;ta keeps quite &s;till and &s;ilent, only whi&s;tling from time to time, through &s;everal tin whi&s;tles, hanging to his neck, by means of which he mimics with great exactne&s;s, the chirping of &s;everal kinds of birds. All birds lie very &s;till, when they feel them&s;elves entangled in a net, except the kite, who is often caught in the Roccolo, when too eager in his pur&s;uit of &s;mall birds. A kite as &s;oon as he finds him&s;elf entrapped, &s;queaks out as loud as he can; but there is always a man attending the Roc|coli&s;ta, at the bottom of the tower, ready to wring off his neck.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="277">Be&s;ides the Roccolo, and the common method of &s;preading nets, or going out with a fowling-piece, there are divers other ways of catching birds. One, which may be called peculiar to the Italians, is that u&s;ed on tho&s;e lakes abounding with birds of the web-footed &s;ort. There, in the proper &s;ea&s;on of the year, a hundred little boats or more, if the breadth of the lakes makes it nece&s;&s;ary, are pro|vided. Each of the&s;e be&s;ides the rower contains a &s;port&s;man, with a number of hand-guns ready loaded. The boats &s;tart all together in a line, from one &s;ide of the lake, and make towards the oppo|&s;ite, where the game is flown, at the &s;ight of &s;o many boats and people. As the boats approach them, the affrighted birds all ri&s;e in a cloud to a certain height, and fly towards the &s;ide of the lake, from whence the &s;port&s;men &s;tarted; and as they are pa&s;&s;ing over, each &s;port&s;man di&s;charges his fowl|ing pieces as fa&s;t as he can, and occa&s;ion many of the birds to fall into the water, and frequently in the boats. As this &s;ort of &s;port is not le&s;s noi&s;y than plea&s;ant, there are many ladies, who partake of it, and prove excellent marks-women, being not in the lea&s;t afraid of the report of a gun. When the chace is over, the dead fowls are collected, and divided among the &s;port&s;men.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="278">On the lagunas, round Venice, there is al&s;o ano|ther &s;ingular method of killing great quantities of the palmipedous birds, which are there in great plenty. Several empty and uncovered tubs are &s;unk in the &s;hallows, within two or three inches of the brim, and placed at a proper di&s;tance from each other. A great number of &s;port&s;men, well pro|vided with &s;mall fowling pieces, ready loaded, and cartridges to load again, if nece&s;&s;ary, repair in boats to the&s;e tubs before break of day; get into them and &s;end away the boats. As &s;oon as day light ap|pears, the birds fly about in &s;earch of their food. The &s;port&s;men, who &s;tand peeping over the brim of their tubs, &s;hoot at all tho&s;e which come within their reach. This &s;port la&s;ts a good part of the morning, and when it is over, the watermen come and fetch the &s;port&s;men out of their tubs; row about collecting the dead floating birds; then all go merrily together to land, where the game is fairly divided.</P>
<P>There are many other methods u&s;ed in Italy for making a prey of all kinds of birds, though none &s;o &s;ingular as the&s;e already mentioned.</P>
<P>Though the better &s;ort of people among the Ita|lians are not very fond of procuring them&s;elves plea&s;ure by violent exerci&s;e, it is otherwi&s;e with
<PB N="241" REF="279">
the common people; and the mentioning &s;ome of their diver&s;ions, which approach the neare&s;t to the ancient pale&s;trical games, will po&s;&s;ibly not be thought improper, as tending to give a more com|plete idea of the manners of the people of this country.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t general games, and peculiar to Italy, is the <HI>Pallone.</HI> A <HI>Pallone</HI> is a leather ball, filled with hair, about the &s;ize of a large pumpkin. Twelve per&s;ons generally play at this game; &s;ix again&s;t &s;ix. No one is reckoned a good player who cannot throw the ball to the di&s;tance of a hun|dred yards at lea&s;t with one blow. The ball is &s;truck with a wooden in&s;trument, called a <HI>bracciale,</HI> which, in &s;hape, bears &s;ome re&s;emblance to a muff, and is entirely covered with &s;hort wooden &s;pikes, cut in the form of a diamond.</P>
<P>The player introduces his hand and arm into this in&s;trument, almo&s;t up to his elbow, and firmly gra&s;ps a peg fixed acro&s;s in the in&s;ide of the <HI>bracciale.</HI> Thus armed, and lightly clad, each player being previou&s;ly po&s;ted at a proper di&s;tance from each other, they &s;et to it with great alertne&s;s, &s;ix again&s;t &s;ix, and &s;trike the <HI>pallone</HI> backwards and forwards, with as much &s;trength and dexterity as they can, when it comes in their way, or run to it
<PB N="242" REF="280">
when at a di&s;tance, all endeavouring to make it ultimately fall far from them&s;elves, and into the ground occupied by their antagoni&s;ts, much in the &s;ame manner as the players of tennis.</P>
<P>This game, which cannot be played but in &s;ome &s;pacious place, and be&s;t by the &s;ide of &s;ome high wall, or long range of building, is very common in &s;ummer, towards the latter part of the evening, in almo&s;t all the towns and villages of Italy: It is even u&s;ual for the players of one town to &s;end chal|lenges to tho&s;e of another, though at the di&s;tance of a hundred miles or more, and invite them to try their &s;kill for a &s;tipulated &s;um. On this occa|&s;ion great crowds of people re&s;ort to &s;ee them play, nor are gentlemen and people of rank &s;ometimes aver&s;e to be inrolled in the li&s;t of players.</P>
<P>In the upper parts of Italy they have a cu&s;tom during the &s;pring months, to peel off the bark from a high poplar tree, and &s;trip it of all its branches in &s;uch a manner as to make the trunk perfectly &s;mooth. When the tree is thus prepared, they hang on the top a con&s;iderable quantity of hams, fowls, and other eatables, which are not to be pro|cured, but by a&s;cending the tree. The mo&s;t vi|gorous of the young pea&s;ants embrace the trunk vigorou&s;ly, and one at a time, as they are drawn by
<PB N="243" REF="281">
lot: and helping them&s;elves by fa&s;tening a rope round the tree as they a&s;cend, alternately tying and untying, they endeavour to obtain the proffered premium. But mo&s;t of them, &s;ome from a greater and others from a le&s;&s;er height, are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively borne down; and, for want of &s;ufficient &s;trength and dexterity, &s;lide down with great velocity to the ground, to the no &s;mall diver&s;ion of the numerous &s;pectators of both &s;exes. But he who is &s;o robu&s;t and &s;kilful as to reach the top, and throw down the eatables, not only has them to him&s;elf, but in&s;tantly becomes &s;o great a favourite with the young maidens round the country, that happy is &s;he to whom he deigns to pay his addre&s;&s;es, and &s;hall a&s;k in mar|riage.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of Piedmont the young pea&s;ants have another method of amu&s;ing them&s;elves, &s;ingu|lar enough; this is to &s;tand erect in their carts, drawn by oxen, intoxicated with wine. The&s;e drunken animals, as it may well be imagined, run at a prodigious rate, the moment they are let loo&s;e, pricked and frightened as they are by the &s;houtings and hideous clamour of a numerous rabble. The carts are frequently drawn out of the road, over uneven ground, and not &s;eldom overturned in ditches and hollow places, to the great danger of the fellows riding in them, who thus madly expo&s;e
<PB N="244" REF="282">
their life and limbs. Yet the vanity of appearing &s;uperior to their neighbour, operates alike on the human heart, whether ru&s;tic or civilized; and the de&s;ire of acquiring di&s;tinction, as well as the cer|tainty, in ca&s;e of good &s;ucce&s;s, that they will be|come con&s;iderable in the eyes of their &s;weet-hearts, makes the young pea&s;ants of Piedmont venture upon &s;o perilous an exploit, with the greate&s;t intre|pidity and alacrity. In this di&s;trict of Italy they had al&s;o the <HI>battajola,</HI> as they called it; that is a battle, regularly fought every holiday in the after|noon, between the inhabitants of one part of Tu|rin again&s;t tho&s;e of another; the numbers of each &s;ide being always very much increa&s;ed by the pea|&s;ants. The place of action was under the walls of Turin, on the &s;ide of the river Po. There the par|ties, which &s;ometimes amounted to &s;everal thou|&s;ands, flung &s;tones at each other from &s;lings for many hours, with inexpre&s;&s;ible fury; each party endeavouring to put the oppo&s;ite &s;ide to flight, and make them pri&s;oners, when they immediately &s;haved their heads, and otherwi&s;e very much in|&s;ulted them, before they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The <HI>bat|tajola</HI> u&s;ually began by boys on both &s;ides, but ge|nerally ended with men, who were gradually fired at the &s;ight of the combat, and by the yielding of the boys when overpowered by their opponents. Many were the heads broken on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and
<PB N="245" REF="283">
&s;carce a holiday pa&s;&s;ed without &s;ome per&s;on being killed. This ancient cu&s;tom was, in a great mea|&s;ure, aboli&s;hed by the pre&s;ent king, on the mar|riage of his third wife; for it happened that the new queen, de&s;irous of &s;eeing the <HI>battajola,</HI> went with a great retinue, to view it from the gardens belonging to the royal palace, chu&s;ing a place that was thought out of the reach of a &s;ling. Yet it &s;o happened that one of the &s;lingers had the in&s;olence to &s;ling a &s;tone where &s;he was, which &s;truck one of her ladies. This made the King re&s;olve to put an end to this brutal diver&s;ion by a &s;evere proclama|tion, and by &s;ending &s;oldiers to di&s;per&s;e the rabble, as &s;oon as they prepared to a&s;&s;emble; &s;o that at pre&s;ent the <HI>battajola</HI> con&s;i&s;ts only of a few daring boys, who go to fight at a much greater di&s;tance from the town, than they u&s;ed to do before that ac|cident happened.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e the only perilous amu&s;ements prac|ti&s;ed in Italy. Tho&s;e who delight in v$ewing prints may po&s;&s;ibly recollect having &s;een one by a famous ma&s;ter, called <HI>Il ponte di Pi&s;a,</HI> (or the bridge of Pi&s;a) repre&s;enting a kind of battle, which u&s;ed often to be fought on the bridge of that town, by two parties; the combatants clad in iron armour, with helmets on their heads, and furiou&s;ly wielding heavy clubs, in order to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="246" REF="284">
bridge. Numbers in the &s;cuffle had their heads broken, in &s;pite of their helmets and armour; and many more were beaten or pu&s;hed headlong into the river Arno, underneath. It is true, that tho&s;e who thus fell, were immediately taken out of the water by boats, placed in the river on purpo&s;e; but as too many lives were lo&s;t every year on this bar|barous diver&s;ion, Government put a &s;top to it, and only a few boys are now &s;uffered to fight occa&s;ion|ally with their fi&s;ts, for the conque&s;t of this bridge; a practice very cu&s;tomary at Venice. It is ob&s;erva|ble that, in the prints abovementioned, the com|batants are repre&s;ented to be naked, though, in fact, they fought completely armed.</P>
<P>Their bull-fights, hor&s;e-races, and regattas we have already noticed, under the articles of Venice, Rome, and Tu&s;cany. We &s;hall therefore conclude this review of the cu&s;toms and manners of the Ita|lians, with a &s;hort account of their in-door amu&s;e|ments; particularly their games of cards, &s;ome of which appear more complicated than ours.</P>
<P>That man, &s;ays <HI>Barelli,</HI> would certainly appear extraordinary, if not ridiculous, who &s;hould at|tempt to appreciate the different degrees of mental power, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the principal European na|tions, by drawing inferences from tho&s;e portions of
<PB N="247" REF="285">
wit nece&s;&s;arily employed, when they play at their national games. Forbearing, therefore, to enter into this &s;ubtle di&s;qui&s;ition, &s;ays the above writer, I will only ob&s;erve, that it is not without rea&s;on the Engli&s;h are proud of their game of whi&s;t, the French of picquet, and the Spaniards of ombre, three of the be&s;t games of cards po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the&s;e nations. To obtain a victory, or prevent being de|feated, at any of them, requires &s;o much quickne&s;s and &s;agacity, that no wonder even men of good parts are flattered, when prai&s;ed for their &s;kill in either of the&s;e games.</P>
<P>Which of them demands mo&s;t &s;kill I will not take upon me to determine; but this I will ven|ture to affirm, that three or four of our Italian games of cards are as much &s;uperior in this re&s;pect to whi&s;t, picquet, and ombre, as che&s;s is to Poli&s;h drafts. The games I mean, are tho&s;e which we form out of tho&s;e cards called <HI>Minchiate</HI> and <HI>Taroc|co's:</HI> the fir&s;t played all over Tu&s;cany, and in the dominions of the Pope; the &s;econd, in Piedmont and Lombardy. I crave the indulgence of the reader for endeavouring to give him &s;ome idea of both the&s;e games, to make him &s;en&s;ible that the Italians, who have often appeared great in tho&s;e arts, con&s;idered great by mankind, are al&s;o great in tho&s;e that mankind regard as little.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="286">Both the minchiate and the taroccos con&s;i&s;t of five &s;uits in&s;tead of four, as in other packs of cards. Four of the&s;e five &s;uits corre&s;pond with the four &s;uits of the common cards, with the addition only of one card to the three figured ones in each &s;uit; &s;o that, in&s;tead of king, queen, and knave, we have king, queen, knight, and knave. As to the fifth &s;uit it con&s;i&s;ts of 41 cards in the minchiate, and 22 in the taroccos; and this fifth &s;uit is called by a name an&s;wering to trumps in Engli&s;h. Both the&s;e games may be played by only two or three people &s;everal ways; but the mo&s;t ingenious, and the mo&s;t in u&s;e, are two or three games played by four peo|ple, more e&s;pecially one which is played by one again&s;t three, in the &s;ame manner as ombre, and another played two again&s;t two, &s;omething like whi&s;t.</P>
<P>By this the reader will &s;ee, that each of the&s;e games mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be much &s;uperior to whi&s;t and ombre, on account of the greater number of combinations produced, either by the 97 cards of the minchiate, or by the 78 of the tarocco; which combinations cannot but give a larger &s;cope to the imagination, than the le&s;&s;er number of 40 at ombre, or 52 at whi&s;t, and oblige the player to exert his memory and judgment more than at the latter of the&s;e games.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="287">Strangers object to the games of minchiate and tarocco, becau&s;e they produce &s;o many combi|nations as to prove fatiguing; but if this argu|ment carries conviction, we mu&s;t of cour&s;e con|clude, that che&s;s is le&s;s delightful than loo, becau&s;e it forces the mind to a greater recollection of its powers than loo. This rea&s;oning is certainly ju&s;t, with regard to &s;luggi&s;h minds, but will not hold with re&s;pect to tho&s;e that are lively and compre|hen&s;ive. Tho&s;e Italians, however, who&s;e minds are much too contracted and di&s;proportionate to the taroccos and minchiate; or who do not choo&s;e to exert their talents too much, have &s;till the means of diverting them&s;elves with &s;everal other games of cards, that require no greater compa&s;s of imagina|tion, or &s;trength of memory and under&s;tanding, than whi&s;t, picquet, and ombre; and others &s;till, pretty nearly on a footing with humble loo it&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Many &s;trangers (concludes <HI>Barretti</HI>) are &s;ur|prized that the Italians learn their games with &s;o much facility, as in a little time to play at them with as much addre&s;s as the be&s;t players among them&s;elves. Hence they infer that Italy abounds in gamblers more than other countries; but would they not &s;peak with greater ju&s;tne&s;s, were they plea&s;ed to &s;ay&mdash;that the Italians, accu&s;tomed to
<PB N="250" REF="288">
more complicated games, ea&s;ily learn tho&s;e which, comparatively &s;peaking, require le&s;s wit, and le&s;s attention?"</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIV.</HI> Of the pre&s;ent State of Italian Literature, and of the learned Profe&s;&s;ions in Italy.</HEAD>
<P>LEARNING is now cultivated in Italy, as well as in other parts of Europe, more out of regard to its u&s;e and convenience in common life, than from any great hopes, by its means, of acquir|ing honour or emoluments. The &s;tock of books, on all kinds of &s;ubjects, is become &s;o ample, that learned and ingenious men cannot now have that facility which their predece&s;&s;ors had, of making them&s;elves known to their cotemporaries, and re|commending them&s;elves to public notice, by hand|ling any new &s;ubject. A Cardinal's hat is not now to be gra&s;ped by climbing the ladders of Greek and Latin; a learned man may, indeed, obtain &s;ome
<PB N="251" REF="289">
petty advantages by his indu&s;try, or by chance; but a bi&s;hopric in Italy, as well as in England, is &s;eldom the reward of merit and learning. "What|ever a &s;tudious reclu&s;e, &s;urrounded by his books, may think of the illu&s;trious age of <HI>Leo,</HI> when I con|&s;ider the wonderful progre&s;s, (&s;ays <HI>Baretti</HI>) that all &s;ciences have made in Europe, within the&s;e three la&s;t centuries, I am tempted to think that, exclu&s;ive of the knowledge of the learned languages, the li|terature of the Engli&s;h women alone, would prove not much inferior to the real knowledge of that il|lu&s;trious age, with which &s;hallow &s;atyri&s;ts, and peevi&s;h poets, of all countries, reproach the degene|racy of their own."</P>
<P>Granting, however, that the modern Italians are not &s;o &s;tudious and learned as their <HI>cinquecenti&s;ti</HI> an|ce&s;tors of <HI>Leo</HI>'s age (a name given to the learned of the 16th century) yet it is pre&s;umptuous in fo|reigners to &s;uppo&s;e the Italians are quite de&s;titute of literary merit.</P>
<P>Let any Engli&s;hman enter the public libraries of Italy, and he will no longer boa&s;t tho&s;e of Oxford, Cambridge, and the Mu&s;eum. The libraries of Milan, Venice, Florence, and Rome, &s;tand in no need of additional &s;helves to vic with the mo&s;t fa|mous Engli&s;h ones. <HI>Mi&s;&s;on,</HI> in his Travels, reckons
<PB N="152" REF="290">
14 in Venice alone, &s;ome larger than that of St. Mark, and almo&s;t all public. In Turin, Pavia, Parma, Padua, Pi&s;a, Modena, Bologna, and Na|ples, there are likewi&s;e ample collections of books for public u&s;e; nor is there &s;carce a town or a convent in Italy without a public or private library.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to enumerate all the &s;tores of learning thus accumulated in various parts of Italy; and the Italians are not &s;o ab&s;urd to keep their libraries for meer &s;hew, or for the plea&s;ure of feed|ing moths and mice. Many learned men are to be found in them, who&s;e lives were early devoted to the acqui&s;ition of knowledge. Ambition and cu|rio&s;ity act upon the inhabitants of Italy with full as much vigour as they do in other countries.</P>
<P>But few are the cultivators of &s;cience who&s;e names are wafted by fame to di&s;tant regions, during their lives; the greate&s;t part mu&s;t be content to enjoy re|nown only in tho&s;e places which gave them birth. They cannot all have a King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> for a patron and panegyri&s;t, who will deign to gild the &s;ilver of <HI>Voltaire,</HI> and the copper of <HI>Algarotti.</HI></P>
<P>Though extended literary reputation, however, be &s;carce attainable by the &s;ons of learning, while
<PB N="153" REF="291">
they live; and though the approaches towards it be gradual and &s;low, yet the names of &s;ome living authors have reached England, and other parts of Europe; and tho&s;e of <HI>Meta&s;ta&s;io,</HI> the Poet; <HI>Mor|gagni,</HI> the Anatomi&s;t; <HI>Fri&s;io,</HI> the Mathematician; and Father <HI>Beccaria,</HI> the Electric Philo&s;opher; are not unknown on the other &s;ide of the Alps.</P>
<P>After this &s;light &s;ketch of their literature, it may not be ami&s;s to mention the advantages which the Italians may rea&s;onably expect from applying them|&s;elves to a life of &s;tudy. An information of this kind will lead our Engli&s;h readers into an acquaint|ance with &s;uch parts of their cu&s;toms, as no other traveller has yet made an object of his attention.</P>
<P>In Italy, when a young man is trained up to phy&s;ic, he has it in his power to get his livelihood in a very &s;hort time; if he will apply to it in &s;uch a manner as to acquire reputation. On quitting the univer&s;ity, which is generally done after a re&s;idence of &s;even years, and having took all his degrees, he goes to &s;erve as a volunteer in &s;ome great ho&s;pital, or puts him&s;elf to a kind of apprentice&s;hip with one of the mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians in a capital town; that he may now learn the practice, as he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have already done the theory of the art.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="292">The Italian phy&s;icians vi&s;it all their patients, with their pupils con&s;tantly attending them, whom they oblige to in&s;pect minutely all the di&s;orders that fall in their way, and notice the remedies they pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>This kind of life they generally follow, till an op|portunity offers of being cho&s;en phy&s;ician to an ho&s;pital, or to go in the &s;ame capacity to &s;ome &s;mall town or village. When a vacancy offers, there are generally &s;everal competitors. But the young phy&s;ician who has acquired the be&s;t cha|racter for &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion, and prudence in private life, has mo&s;t chance of &s;ucceeding in his application. His &s;ucce&s;s however depends on the &s;uffrages of the corporation, who are not always in|fluenced in their choice by &s;uperior merit. Par|tiality will &s;ometimes interfere, and give an ap|pointment to one, which ought to be be&s;towed on another.</P>
<P>When the appointment is obtained, the young practitioner keeps it till he hears of a better, and then offers him&s;elf a candidate for that. By the&s;e means they &s;hift from place to place, that is, from a &s;maller appointment to a greater.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="293">No patient, in any provincial town, is obliged to fee the phy&s;ician for his attendance, as he is allowed by the corporation a &s;alary for that pur|po&s;e. All families, however, whether they have occa&s;ion for one or not, &s;end him &s;ome little pre|&s;ent at Ea&s;ter and Chri&s;tmas; which con&s;i&s;ts of a lamb or kid, hams, &s;au&s;ages, capons, game, oil, wine, corn, or the like. The poore&s;t pea&s;ant would be a&s;hamed not to &s;end at lea&s;t a couple of fowls to his phy&s;ician, during the holidays.</P>
<P>If a village is &s;o &s;mall as not to afford a &s;uf|ficient &s;alary, it is annexed to one or two more in the neighbourhood, and the phy&s;ician is then enabled to keep a hor&s;e or a chai&s;e. It is al&s;o the bu&s;ine&s;s of the corporation to provide a lodging for him, when he is obliged to make a &s;tay among them, and be ab&s;ent from his u&s;ual place of re&s;idence. If the place, on the contrary, is too large for one phy&s;ician, the corporation calls in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another, who is paid and elected like the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;alaries, with the pre&s;ents, are equivalent, upon a medium, to a capitation of two &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> head; and few of the appointments contain le&s;s than 300 &s;ouls; nor do they, in general, ex|ceed 7 or 800. So the provincial phy&s;icians get about 30 or 40l. a-year, in the &s;malle&s;t places
<PB N="256" REF="294">
and about 70 or 80 in the large&s;t; and either of the&s;e afford a &s;ufficient competence, as there is no provincial town in Italy, where a middling fa|mily may not be decently maintained with the &s;malle&s;t of the&s;e &s;ums.</P>
<P>All phy&s;icians, however, do not proceed in this manner. Some act for many years as &s;ub&s;titutes for their principals, and &s;et up in great cities, where many of them have acquired very ea&s;y fortunes.</P>
<P>Whether this method of proceeding, with regard to the practice of phy&s;ic, be preferable to that u&s;ed in England, I will not take upon me to determine. It may perhaps be le&s;s lucrative to &s;ome of the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of medicine. But it &s;eems more u&s;eful to the people, who are much better accommodated with the aid of phy&s;icians, regularly bred, than the lower cla&s;s of people in England.</P>
<P>The young men who apply them&s;elves to Sur|gery, go through life in a &s;imilar manner. As for the apothecaries, any per&s;on who choo&s;es it, may &s;et up for one, after having undergone proper exa|minations. But the phy&s;icians in every place, are obliged to vi&s;it, at lea&s;t once a year, the &s;hops of the
<PB N="257" REF="295">
apothecaries, where they have power to de&s;troy all the decayed and bad drugs.</P>
<P>With regard to tho&s;e who apply them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of the law, they are more dependent on go|vernment, than the other profe&s;&s;ions; being &s;ent, after they have quitted the univer&s;ities, as Pode&s;tas, or judges in different parts of the provinces. There a young lawyer admini&s;ters both civil and criminal ju&s;tice, in ca&s;es of le&s;&s;er moment; but in tho&s;e of importance, people mu&s;t re&s;ort to higher tribu|nals.</P>
<P>When a young Pode&s;ta has thus admini&s;tered ju&s;tice for three years, a Syndic is &s;ent to make the tour of all the places, where the Pode&s;tas re&s;ide. Public notice is then given in each re&s;pective place, of the arrival of the Syndic, and every per&s;on, with|out exception, is at liberty to lay before him any complaint again&s;t the Pode&s;ta. The&s;e complaints are immediately tran&s;mitted by the Syndic, to the highe&s;t magi&s;trate of the &s;tate, and by him ex|amined. If found trifling, or ill-grounded, they are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, but if ju&s;t, redre&s;&s;ed. But a Pode&s;ta has little chance of being promoted to a more lucrative part, if it &s;hould appear that he has not admini&s;tered ju&s;tice with impartiality. If he has, he is &s;ent to a more profitable place for another triennium, and &s;o
<PB N="258" REF="296">
on; nor is any Pode&s;ta ever kept more than three years in the &s;ame place, that he may not contract &s;trong attachments to particular people, or run into any danger of partiality.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides applying for the&s;e po&s;ts, the young &s;tu|dents take up the profe&s;&s;ion of advocate, in great cities, and have clients, much in the &s;ame manner as the coun&s;ellors in England. In this line of life, they generally fare as in England, according to their abilities and eloquence: and from this cla&s;s, the chief magi&s;trates and &s;uperior judges are cho&s;en by government.</P>
<P>What the government does with re&s;pect to the law &s;tudents, the bi&s;hops do with regard to tho&s;e in di|vinity. The&s;e are &s;ent as curates, rectors, or vi|cars, from the capital towns, to the villages, or &s;mall places in their di&s;trict, as &s;oon as they have obtained the order of Prie&s;thood. But they are not removed triennally as the Pode&s;tas. They &s;ucceed like phy&s;icians to vacancies in the different towns and villages; and he who is thought be&s;t qualified, is generally preferred by the electors appointed by the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>The reader is not to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e cu&s;toms to be univer&s;al throughout Italy. The country being di|vided
<PB N="259" REF="297">
into many &s;overeignties of different forms, the laws and cu&s;toms mu&s;t con&s;equently differ. Yet this, in the main, is the plan which each of them follow, with re&s;pect to the three profe&s;&s;ions of law, phy&s;ic, and divinity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e channels, which the <HI>literati</HI> of Italy have open to them for honours and emolument, and through which they may advance to the highe&s;t po&s;ts in church and &s;tate; the univer&s;ities are al&s;o open to them; and to obtain the chairs of profe&s;|&s;ors, generally depends on their reputation for learn|ing. The &s;alaries annexed to the profe&s;&s;ions, are partly paid by government, and ari&s;e partly from fees and perqui&s;ites. Few of the Italian univer&s;ities have lands and funds of their own, like tho&s;e of Ox|ford and Cambridge.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on is cho&s;en profe&s;&s;or, he has only to continue reading his lecture, and acquire learning and credit; and he may be certain to end his days in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, if he arrives at old age, his &s;alary being generally augmented every &s;even years. After 14 years, he is at liberty to quit the univer&s;ity, and retire on half pay, and frequently receives the whole, if he has rendered him&s;elf u&s;eful and con|&s;picuous.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="298">The divi&s;ion of Italy into &s;o many &s;tates, makes the inhabitants of different governments almo&s;t as much &s;trangers to each other, as if they inhabited &s;o many i&s;lands; they &s;eldom travelling into each others territories. This ob&s;tructs the enlargement of our capital cities, which cannot all be &s;wallowed up in one, like London and Paris. A country &s;o con&s;tituted, cannot afford the means of any con&s;i|derable pecuniary advantage to &s;uch as devote their lives to tho&s;e kinds of literature, independent of the three learned profe&s;&s;ions. Hence the writer who applies to poetry, hi&s;tory, a&s;tronomy, botany, and other branches of ornamental literature, cannot rai&s;e contributions on the public, as in Paris and London. They have likewi&s;e to encounter many difficulties in the publication. Nothing is &s;uffered to be printed in Italy, without being fir&s;t licenced by two, and &s;ometimes more, revi&s;ers, appointed by the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers. The&s;e revi&s;ers are to peru&s;e every manu&s;cript intended for the pre&s;s; and &s;ome|times their timidity or ignorance; at others, their vanity or ill-humour, rai&s;e &s;o many objections, that a poor author is quite &s;urfeited of his own pro|ductions. This ordeal trial is very trouble&s;ome, and &s;hould the cu&s;tom be now revived in England, few writers would have phlegm enough to &s;ubmit to it. Long u&s;e, however, has reconciled it to the Italians,
<PB N="261" REF="299">
and few printers there, will dare to violate the law, and print a book &s;ecretly.</P>
<P>Were this privilege of printing books, <HI>ad libitum,</HI> admitted in Italy, it would not fail, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> of being mi&s;chievous to the different &s;tates, without encrea&s;ing knowledge in proportion. Such a free|dom would hardly contribute to multiply the <HI>Me|ta&s;ta&s;ios</HI> and <HI>Gozzis</HI> or the <HI>Finettis</HI> and <HI>Morgagnis.</HI> But on the other hand, it would &s;oon degenerate into licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and the times of the ob&s;cene <HI>Arelinos,</HI> and the athei&s;tical <HI>Brunos</HI> would pre|&s;ently be revived. Every &s;cribbling <HI>Abatino</HI> of Rome, would then declaim in the mo&s;t virulent manner again&s;t kings and emperors, did they declare war, or make peace in oppo&s;ition to the intere&s;ts of the Apo&s;tolic See. A ragged <HI>Birricchino</HI> of Bologna, would be&s;mear, with his blacke&s;t ink, the hand|&s;ome&s;t queens for encouraging foreign manufac|turers to &s;ettle in their dominions; and a &s;tupid <HI>Laz|zerone</HI> of Naples, would be lavi&s;h of the vile&s;t epi|thets on any little republic, that &s;hould permit their &s;hip-wrights to build men of war, and &s;ell them to tho&s;e, who have money enough to purcha&s;e them. No public character would find &s;helter again&s;t that deluge of outrageous &s;atire, which would flow from the Italian pens, and every private reputation would
<PB N="262" REF="300">
be at the mercy of any &s;coundrel that could rhyme.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t of the Italian &s;tates, very few individuals have their &s;leep interrupted by the political mea|&s;ures of their re&s;pective governments; but were our pre&s;s &s;et free, continues <HI>Baretti,</HI> many an oilman of Lucca, many a wine-merchant of Empoli, and many a tallow-chandler of Modena would pretend to be wi&s;er than &s;ecretaries of &s;tate; and wonder that kings and queens had not taken them from their counters, and rai&s;ed them to the highe&s;t employ|ments. Sedition, defamation, profanene&s;s, and ri|baldry, would then quickly circulate through all our towns, villages, and hamlets. Irreligion would be &s;ub&s;tituted for bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition: the pope would be called anti-chri&s;t, and mother-church a whore. Such would be the ble&s;&s;ed effects of a free pre&s;s in Italy, could we ever be indulged in it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXV.</HI> Marriages and Funerals.</HEAD>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to their marriages and funerals, people marry in Italy, as in England, after the publication of three banns; and a di&s;pen&s;ation is ea&s;ily to be procured there, as well as here, by tho&s;e who do not choo&s;e to be married in a church. Great dinners and &s;uppers are u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;i|ons, in both countries; that is, among the middle and lower cla&s;s of people, who adhere longe&s;t to old cu&s;toms, and who&s;e u&s;ages form the principal part of the national manners. Congratulations are cu&s;tomary on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>As for their funerals, little more need be &s;aid re&s;pecting them, but that the people in Italy are generally buried in their pari&s;h-church or church|yard; but few corp&s;es are &s;ent to di&s;tant places, to be interred in family vaults, as is the cu&s;tom in England, becau&s;e the Italians live in cities, and not at their country-&s;eats, like the Engli&s;h nobility and gentry.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="302">The principal difference between the two na|tions is, that a corp&s;e in Italy is generally e&s;corted to the place of interment by a large proce&s;&s;ion of prie&s;ts, friars, and orphans, of both &s;exes, main|tained in ho&s;pitals; all with lighted tapers in their hands, and &s;inging penitentiary p&s;alms, litanies and other compo&s;itions adapted to the occa&s;ion. And &s;uch proce&s;&s;ions are longer or &s;horter; that is, more or le&s;s expen&s;ive, according to the directions of the te&s;tator, or tho&s;e, who&s;e office it is to provide for the funeral.</P>
<P>In travelling through Italy, a &s;tranger &s;hould endea|vour, on reaching the fir&s;t town, to obtain as many letters of recommendation as he can, to take along with him as he advances further into the coun|try. The nobility of every place, and particularly the <HI>literati,</HI> will be plea&s;ed to give &s;uch letters, and the people to whom he will be thus recommended, will &s;till addre&s;s him to others; &s;o that in arriving in any city, he will have per&s;ons to conver&s;e with, and they will be all glad of doing &s;ome of tho&s;e petty offices, which render travelling agreeable. He may indeed, often find that the per&s;ons to whom he is re|commended, are not in every re&s;pect, &s;uch as he would like. One will be over civil, another over blunt; one will be ab&s;urd in one particular, and others in &s;everal, but people mu&s;t be taken as they
<PB N="265" REF="303">
are. Perfect characters are uncommon every where. A &s;tranger, therefore, &s;hould make the be&s;t u&s;e of each. One will &s;hew the place; another his pic|tures; a third his medals, and &s;o on. Nor &s;hould he omit, if he makes the lea&s;t &s;tay in any place, to enquire who are the friars of mo&s;t repute, and pay them a vi&s;it. To a friar, there is no need of any introduction. It is enough that you pay them the u&s;ual compliment, by telling them, you have heard of their merit, and therefore could not mi&s;s the op|portunity of paying your re&s;pects to them. They will all be extremely civil, &s;hew their convents, their libraries, their gardens, and whatever curi|o&s;ities they have. They will give every informa|tion of their rules and manner of living, which is pretty &s;ingular in each convent, and merits notice. Mo&s;t of them are very frank and open with &s;trangers, &s;o that it may be ea&s;ily collected from their di&s;cour&s;e, what is their &s;anctity or hypocri&s;y, their knowledge or ignorance, their plea&s;ures or their pains. Nor &s;hould they be judged from the coun|tenance they put on at the altar, or in a proce&s;&s;ion. They mu&s;t be &s;een in their cells, and at their tables where the rules of their order permit them to eat and drink with &s;trangers: and thus he will come to the knowledge of as &s;ingular a &s;et of men, as ever attracted philo&s;ophical curio&s;ity. A traveller &s;hould
<PB N="266" REF="304">
&s;hun nothing, &s;light nothing; if he is in danger from general intercour&s;e, he is not fit to travel.</P>
<P>Some writers a&s;&s;ert, that the bread and wine are bad throughout Italy, particularly the wine. This is not true. The poor people in &s;everal parts of Italy, often eat bread that is very indifferent; but people in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, eat good bread every where. As to the wine, there is &s;ome very good in many parts of Italy, without a per&s;on is determined to allow no wine to be good, but claret and bur|gundy. And even the&s;e wines are to be met with in all great towns, and it is only for a &s;tranger to take half a dozen bottles in his carriage, to &s;erve him from one town to another. The like may be ob|&s;erved with re&s;pect to hams, &s;au&s;ages, or fowls, which may be carried, made ready for the pot or &s;pit, with very little trouble.</P>
<P>The beds, indeed, are bad enough in many places, and a &s;tranger in travelling, &s;hould endeavour never to &s;leep but in his own &s;heets; becau&s;e the inn-keepers, when poor, are in general very ill &s;tocked with linen; and to &s;ave their credit, will &s;wear no per&s;on has &s;lept in the &s;heets they offer, though the contrary is very evident; nor would it be ami&s;s to have a thin mattra&s;s, &s;tuffed with feathers or Spani&s;h wool, to throw over the mattra&s;&s;es of the inn.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="305">Some young travellers are very apt to be rude with the maid-&s;ervants at inns. They had better make their propo&s;al, and had &s;till better let it alone; for little good will they get either by their rudene&s;s or their propo&s;als. If the nymph be willing, there is danger on one &s;ide, if unwilling, at another. The common people in Italy, are generally very fierce, where women are concerned. Care &s;hould be taken not to be over bu&s;y with actre&s;&s;es and fi|gurantes, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> for they will both fleece a &s;tranger, and bring him acquainted with &s;urgeons and apothecaries.</P>
<P>Altercations with inn-keepers, po&s;tillions, and &s;uch kinds of people, &s;hould by all means be avoid|ed, and a traveller &s;hould be particularly on his guard, never to forget him&s;elf &s;o far, as to &s;trike any of them; for they are mo&s;t of them very choleric, and there is no honour to be got by conquering them. Impetuous characters are di&s;liked every where, and it is not to be imagined, how much the common people of Italy dete&s;t being bullied, e&s;pecially by &s;trangers. An open countenance, an affable look, a kind enquiry after their chri&s;tian names, and the offer of a gla&s;s of wine, if at meals, will do wonders towards obtaining whatever may be wanted of them: for the Italians have in general quick feelings, are of a yielding di&s;po&s;ition, and as generous a &s;et of
<PB N="268" REF="306">
mortals, as any in the world. If &s;ome rules of this &s;ort are not previou&s;ly laid down, travelling will be no better than a continual &s;cene of vexation and wrangling, not only in Italy, but in all countries</P>
<P>Credit not your travel writers, &s;ays <HI>Baretti,</HI> about the character of the Italians, or your imagination will be di&s;turbed by the mo&s;t horrible tales. There is &s;carce one of them who has not &s;ome &s;tory to tell of a fellow in a church, who has &s;tabbed dif|ferent people. Yet, all over Italy, in towns or vil|lages, on great roads, or along narrow paths, a tra|veller may be a&s;&s;ured, that no per&s;on will offend him, if he does not choo&s;e to be offended: but on the contrary, he will meet with abundance of kind|ne&s;s and re&s;pect, if he will but moderately de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>All this pre-&s;uppo&s;es &s;ome knowledge of the lan|guage, otherwi&s;e travelling in any country is di&s;a|greeable and vexatious. Should he, however, be unprovided in this re&s;pect, let him ha&s;ten to Flo|rence or Sienne, though Florence is preferable, and labour till he has acquired a proficiency of the lan|guage. If he wi&s;hes to be any thing of a critic in Italian, Florence is the be&s;t place in all Italy, both to obtain a good phra&s;eology, and a good pro|nunciation, as Florence is in both re&s;pects to Italy, what Athens was to Greece.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF SWITZERLAND, FROM BUSCHING, COXE, L'ANGLE, MARTYN, KEYSLER, GROSLEY, and others.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Country, Climate, Mountains, Rivers, and Productions.</HEAD>
<P>SWITZERLAND, the Helvetia of the Ancients, lies between France, Italy, and Germany, being bounded by Germany on the north and ea&s;t, by Italy on the &s;outh, and by France on the we&s;t. It is about 225 miles in length, and 83 in breadth, and &s;eparated from the adjacent countries by high mountains, mo&s;t of which are covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>Switzerland is one of the highe&s;t lands in Europe, the greate&s;t part of it con&s;i&s;ting of chains of hills, ranged one under another, with only narrow vallies between them; the&s;e hills al&s;o are compo&s;ed of &s;tupendous rocky ma&s;&s;es, two, four, and even &s;ix, be|ing piled on each other, and from four to 10,000 feet high. One peak on a mountain called St. <HI>Gothard,</HI>
<PB N="270" REF="309">
is computed at 16,500 French feet. The lower parts of the&s;e high mountains are covered with woods and pa&s;tures, the herbage of which is of a re|markable length and richne&s;s. The middle parts abound in a great variety of odoriferous herbs, thickets, and bu&s;hes, as al&s;o in excellent &s;prings, and in &s;ummer are frequented by herd&s;men with their cattle. The upper parts of the&s;e mountains, con&s;i&s;t almo&s;t entirely of craggy and inacce&s;&s;ible rocks, &s;ome of which are quite bare, without any herbage growing upon them, not even &s;o much as gra&s;s; whil&s;t others are continually covered with &s;now and ice. The vallies between the&s;e icy and &s;nowy mountains, form an appearance like &s;o many &s;mooth frozen lakes, and va&s;t fragments of ice often fall down from them, into the intervals of the more fruitful eminences. It is from the&s;e ma&s;&s;es, and the thawing of the ice in general, that the greate&s;t part of the &s;treams and rivers in Switzerland are de|rived. The ice-mountains begin in the canton of Glarus, and, after pa&s;&s;ing through the territory of the Gri&s;ons, and from thence into the Canton of Uri, terminate in the di&s;trict of Bern.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t of the&s;e mountains are tho&s;e in the Canton of Uri, which &s;end forth rivers to all the principal parts of the world. This is the mo&s;t dreary tract of all Switzerland, and on the &s;ummit
<PB N="271" REF="310">
of the mountains, one eternal cold almo&s;t always prevails; with hard gales of wind, and very damp fogs; whereas the vallies, excepting &s;ome towns and villages, with a few fields, and &s;till fewer vine|yards, thick woods and rich pa&s;tures, are over-run with lakes and other waters, and the &s;ummer heats there, are frequently &s;o in&s;upportable, that the in|habitants betake them&s;elves to the mountains, though in winter, their hou&s;es are almo&s;t buried with &s;now. In many places, within a &s;mall compa&s;s, the four &s;ea&s;ons are &s;een at once, and &s;ometimes &s;ummer and winter are &s;o near each other, that one hand may take up &s;now, and the other gather grow|ing flowers. During mo&s;t parts of the year, the clouds lie beneath the peaks of the highe&s;t moun|tains; &s;o that from thence they appear like a &s;ea, the peaks projecting among them like i&s;lands. Sometimes too they break, and thus di&s;play a view of the &s;ubterjacent country. From the ri&s;ing and falling of the clouds, the inhabitants form almo&s;t certain conjectures with re&s;pect to the weather. Not one of the&s;e mountains is without a cataract or water-fall, and as the eye, by rea&s;on of the interven|tion of the clouds, is not always able to reach the beginning of them, they look as if poured down from heaven upon the rocks. The water thus fal|ling from one rock to another, makes an a&s;toni&s;hing noi&s;e, and rai&s;es a mi&s;t round it, on which, when the
<PB N="272" REF="311">
&s;un beams play, is formed a very beautiful &s;ight, particularly at the foot of the ca&s;cade, where is ex|hibited an entire circle of the mo&s;t lively colours. Among the&s;e mountains, are many excellent &s;prings, &s;ome of which are medicinal, others warm, and others again cold baths, celebrated for their extraordinary virtues.</P>
<P>Very different from this, is the remaining and &s;maller part of Switzerland, including part of the Cantons of Zurich, Schafhau&s;en, Bern, Ba&s;le, Soleur, and Friburgh, for though this di&s;trict is not without mountains, &s;ome of which are even 2000, or 2500 feet high, yet it is much more level than the above-mentioned part; and the lower parts of the mountains, and &s;ometimes al&s;o the very &s;um|mits are covered with vineyards, corn-fields, mea|dows, and pa&s;ture-grounds. Here are likewi&s;e no Alps, nor rocky precipices, no cataract, few trees, and, in &s;ummer, neither &s;now nor ice. The moun|tains, in&s;tead of being interrupted by va&s;t cha&s;ms or aby&s;&s;es, are generally entire, and compo&s;ed of a few &s;mall eminences; the &s;ummits of which, far from &s;hooting out into peaks, are flat or round, to the extent of many miles, without any con&s;iderable inequality, and frequently afford not only pa&s;turage, but al&s;o arable ground. It is only during long rains, that in the&s;e parts the clouds &s;ink below
<PB N="273" REF="312">
the eminences. Great number of petrifications, more particularly of marine &s;hells and plants, are found among them. The fields too, though generally &s;tony, are fertile, and the meadows in mo&s;t places, are planted with fruit trees.</P>
<P>Switzerland is not only divided from the coun|tries that &s;urround it, by the mountains of the Alps, the highe&s;t in Europe, but almo&s;t every canton is divided from the other, by a ridge of hills, which are covered with &s;now in winter, but afford good pa&s;ture in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;ons are very different in this country, according to the different &s;ituations. If a field lies on the &s;outh &s;ide of a mountain, the &s;now melts early in the &s;pring, and the &s;eed time begins early; while on the north &s;ide, the &s;now lies much longer before it melts. Travellers have ob&s;erved, that when it is &s;eed time on the north &s;ide of the moun|tain, they are frequently at their harve&s;t on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide.</P>
<P>No country in the world can be more agreeable to travellers during the &s;ummer, than Switzerland; for be&s;ides the commodious roads and comfortable inns, &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful objects of nature, woods, mountains, lakes, intermingled with fer|tile
<PB N="274" REF="313">
fields, vineyards, and &s;cenes of the mo&s;t per|fect cultivation, are here pre&s;ented to the eye in greater variety, and on a larger &s;cale, than in any other country. Every body is &s;eldom in the right, remarks <HI>Sherlock;</HI> but every body is in the right in &s;aying, the Swi&s;s are good people. Their country is certainly neither the favourite re&s;idence of genius nor of ta&s;te; but you will no where meet with more &s;en&s;ible men, or more &s;erene foreheads.</P>
<P>The principal rivers are the Rhine, a name given by the Swi&s;s to all &s;treams and rivers in general, which have their ri&s;e in the country of the Gri&s;ons. The Reu&s;&s;i&s;&s;eris form Mount S. Gothard. The river Aar comes from the Grim&s;el-hill, and falls into the Rhine at Coblentz. The Rhine is fir&s;t formed by a water on the Fu&s;ka chain of mountains, and runs into the lake of Geneva, from whence i&s;&s;uing again, it traver&s;es the territory of that city, and then watering a &s;mall part of Savoy, enters France. The Te&s;in has its ri&s;e partly in two lakes on Mount S. Gothard, and mingles with the Lago Maggiore, but emerging again, enters the duchy of Milan, and la&s;tly loo&s;es it&s;elf in the Po.</P>
<P>The large lakes, for the &s;maller ones, are innu|merable, are tho&s;e of Geneva, Neuenburg, Biel, Zurich, the four fore&s;t towns, Thun and Brien, with
<PB N="275" REF="314">
many more, which &s;hall be noticed in the de&s;crip|tion of the &s;everal countries in which they lie. That part of the lake of Con&s;tance, which waters the borders of Thurgau, and the abbey of S. <HI>Gall,</HI> belongs al&s;o to the Helvetic confederacy.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal rivers and lakes, are of con&s;iderable advantage to Switzerland, as &s;upplying it with fi&s;h, and being a means of the great convenience they enjoy in water carriage.</P>
<P>The fo&s;&s;ils here are very con&s;iderable, &s;uch as chalk, mundick, and &s;everal good kinds of clay for the making of earthen-ware. Slate likewi&s;e is very common in many parts; and though white marble is &s;carce, it abounds in coloured. There are al&s;o &s;everal kinds of cry&s;tal. Its other fo&s;&s;ils are &s;and-&s;tone, &s;altpetre, &s;alt, torf, pit-coal, &s;ulphur, &amp;c. Gold du&s;t too is found among the &s;ands of &s;ome of its rivers. Switzerland al&s;o is not without &s;ilver, copper, lead, and more particularly iron ores. It mu&s;t be owned, however, that the metals of this country, are generally ob&s;erved to be brittle, and accordingly, all metallic attempts, a few iron mines excepted, have turned out to the di&s;advantage of the undertakers.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="315">Switzerland is better cultivated, and more popu|lous, than people u&s;ually imagine; though in pro|portion to its extent, the number of towns, vil|lages, and people here falls much &s;hort of that in many other European countries. In &s;everal pro|vinces, there is not &s;o much as one &s;ingle town, and in the whole country, very little more than 100. The prote&s;tant cantons are better inhabited and more wealthy, than the popi&s;h; a variation owing to the convents in the latter.</P>
<P>The levels and vallies produce grain, but not in &s;ufficient quantity, to an&s;wer all the demands of home con&s;umption. Barley is &s;owed on the very ice mountains, the oats in a warmer &s;oil, rye in a &s;till warmer, and the warme&s;t of all is a&s;&s;igned to &s;pelt. In mo&s;t parts, a threefold produce is accounted a tolerable harve&s;t. Flax is much cultivated and worked, though not in &s;ufficient quantity, and the like may be &s;aid of hemp. A beginning likewi&s;e has been made here with tobacco. The Pais de Vaud, the cantons of Bern and Schafhau&s;en, the Valteline, and the Valais, produce the be&s;t wines in Switzerland, and of various &s;orts. An acre of vine|yard is worth from two to 3000 rix-dollars, each rix-dollar 4s 6d. Of apples, pears, nuts, cherries, plums, and che&s;nuts, Switzerland enjoys great plen|ty; and the parts towards Italy, abound in peaches,
<PB N="277" REF="316">
morelles, almonds, figs, citrons, pomegranates, and others fruits of the nobler kind. Of the fir&s;t two, the inhabitants make a very palatable and &s;trong liquor. Mo&s;t of the cantons abound in timber, but in the vale of Avers, dried &s;heeps dung is the common fuel, and the people on the mountain of <HI>S. Gothard,</HI> burn a &s;mall &s;hrub, called the Alpro&s;in, and Breu&s;ch, a &s;pecies of heath, the &s;tem of which is &s;eldom as long as a mans' little finger, and the height of the whole plant almo&s;t a foot and a half; they are ga|thered only on the mountains. La&s;tly, the Valais is noted for its &s;affron.</P>
<P>The inhabitants derive their principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from grazing, which is very profitable here, both the vallies and Alps, or middle parts of their enor|mous mountains, yielding excellent fodder. White meats are the u&s;ual food of the pea&s;ants, and &s;uch as labour in the mines. In the beginning of the &s;um|mer, their cattle are driven up among the Alps, and there committed to the care of certain per&s;ons, &s;tiled <HI>Sennen,</HI> who are either accountable to the owners for the milk, butter, and chee&s;e, or agree to pay a certain &s;um for the u&s;ufructuary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The Senns on all the Alps, likewi&s;e keep hogs, which are fed with the whey, after making butter and chee&s;e. Their chee&s;e is much e&s;teemed in mo&s;t parts of Europe, but the be&s;t is that of Bern and
<PB N="278" REF="317">
Griers in the canton of Friburgh. Great numbers of hor&s;es are brought up here for the French ca|valry.</P>
<P>Of wild animals, the chamois are the mo&s;t re|markable, and of two different &s;pecies; one mak|ing their con&s;tant abode in the highe&s;t and wilde&s;t mountains, to which &s;carce any acce&s;s can be found; and the others, not confining them&s;elves to the peaks and &s;ummits of mountains, but haunting likewi&s;e the woods and thickets in the vales. The chamois are very watchful animals. They u&s;ually get out in herds of 20 or 30; and while they are feeding, one of them po&s;ted on an adjacent height, &s;tands centi|nel, and is relieved every quarter of an hour by ano|ther. The centinel looks around with great &s;olici|tude and attention; and on the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of danger, alarming the herd by a &s;hrill cry; in&s;tantly the whole troop decamp, one following the other.</P>
<P>The chamois feeds on various kinds of herbage, and particularly the rein deer licken, which is found in &s;uch great quantities, as in many parts to cover the &s;ummits and &s;ides of the mountains. In order to get at their favourite food in winter, they, like the rein-deer, clear away the &s;now with their fore-feet, frequently thawing it with their breath, in order to loo&s;en it more ea&s;ily.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="318">The Marmou&s;et, in Latin, <HI>mus Alpinus,</HI> is a kind of badger, but both are mo&s;t properly cla&s;&s;ed among the &s;wine &s;pecies, and towards winter, grows &s;o exceedingly fat, as to weigh upwards of 20 pounds, by which means, it becomes an ea&s;ier prey to the pea&s;ants and hunters. They burrow either in the earth or under a rock. Among the Alps is found likewi&s;e a &s;pecies of hare, which, in &s;ummer, per|fectly re&s;embles other hares, but in winter becomes entirely white; &s;o as to be &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable among the &s;now. Here are al&s;o yellow and white foxes in great numbers, which in winter come down to the vallies. The Lammergeyer, which delights in the highe&s;t peaks, is of the large eagle kind, and its wings are frequently 14 feet in breadth. This bird preys alike on wild and tame animals. There are be&s;ides &s;everal edible fowls here; &s;uch as the moorcock, the rail, &s;nipe, partridge, and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>There is a &s;tuffed &s;pecimen of that &s;pecies of the chamois, which inhabits the highe&s;t and mo&s;t inac|ce&s;&s;ible mountains of the Alps, in <HI>Parkin&s;on's</HI> Mu&s;e|um. It is called by <HI>Cox</HI> the bouquetin. The agility of this animal mu&s;t be very great; for it is &s;aid, that he will mount a perpendicular rock of 15 feet at three leaps, or rather three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive bounds of five feet each. It does not &s;eem as if he found
<PB N="170" REF="319">
any footing on the rock, appearing to touch it merely to be repelled, like an ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tance &s;triking again&s;t a hard body. If he is between two rocks which are near each other, and wants to reach the top, he leaps from the &s;ide of one rock to the other, alternatively, till he has attained the &s;ummit.</P>
<P>As it appears that this animal is extremely rare, and the de&s;cription hitherto given very inaccurate and confu&s;ed, &s;ome farther account of it may not be unintere&s;ting.</P>
<P>The bouquetins feed during the night in the highe&s;t woods: but the &s;un no &s;ooner begins to gild the &s;ummits, than they quit the woody region, and mount, feeding in their progre&s;s, till they have reached the mo&s;t con&s;iderable height. They betake them&s;elves to the &s;ides of the mountains, which face the ea&s;t or &s;outh, and lie down in the highe&s;t places or hotte&s;t expo&s;ures; but when the &s;un has fini&s;hed more than three quarters of its cour&s;e, they again begin to feed and to de&s;cend toward the woods whither they retire, when it is likely to &s;now, and where they always pa&s;s the winter. The bouque|tins a&s;&s;emble in flocks, con&s;i&s;ting, at the mo&s;t, of 12, or 15; but more u&s;ually in &s;maller numbers. The males, which are &s;ix years old and upwards, haunt more elevated places than the females and
<PB N="281" REF="320">
younger bouquetins; and as they advance in age, are le&s;s fond of &s;ociety; they become gradually hardened again&s;t the effects of extreme cold, and frequently live entirely alone.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer they feed principally on the genipi, and other aromatic plants, which grow in the high Alps; and in winter they eat the lickens, and brouze on bu&s;hes, and the tender &s;hoots of trees.</P>
<P>The bouquetins having their &s;ore legs &s;omewhat &s;horter than the hind legs, naturally a&s;cend with greater facility than they de&s;cend; for this rea&s;on, nothing but the &s;evere&s;t weather can engage them to come down into the lower regions; and even in winter, if there are a few fine days, they leave the woods and mount higher.</P>
<P>Winter is the &s;ea&s;on of love with them, and prin|cipally the month of January. The females go with young five months, and con&s;equently produce in the la&s;t week of June, or the fir&s;t of July. At the time of parturition, they &s;eparate from the males, retire to the &s;ide of &s;ome rill, and generally bring forth only one young, though &s;ome naturali&s;ts affirm, they occa&s;ionally produce two.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="321">The common cry of the bouquetin, is a &s;hort &s;harp whi&s;tle, not unlike that of the chamois, but of le&s;s continuance: &s;ometimes it makes a &s;nort, and when young, bleats.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on for hunting the bouquetin, is towards the end of &s;ummer, and in autumn, during the months of Augu&s;t and September, when they are in good condition. None but the inhabitants of the mountains engage in the chace, for it requires not only a head that can bear to look down from the greate&s;t heights without terror, but al&s;o much &s;trength and vigour, to &s;upport hunger, cold, and prodigious fatigue.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t determined hunters of bouquetins, live in the mountains of the lower Valais. Two or three of them u&s;ually a&s;&s;ociate in this perilous occu|pation; they are armed with rifle-barrelled guns, and furni&s;hed with &s;mall bags of provi&s;ions; pa&s;s the night among rocks at con&s;iderable heights; and erect a mi&s;erable hut, where they lie without fire or covering, and on waking, not unfrequently find the entrance blocked up with &s;now, three or four feet in depth. Sometimes, in the pur&s;uit of a bouquetin, being overtaken by darkne&s;s amid crags and preci|pices, they are obliged to pa&s;s the whole night &s;tand|ing, embraced, in order to &s;upport each other, and
<PB N="283" REF="322">
to prevent them&s;elves from &s;leeping. As the bou|quetins a&s;cend into the higher regions very early in the morning, it is nece&s;&s;ary to gain the heights be|fore them, otherwi&s;e they &s;cent the hunter and fly him; it would then be in vain to follow them, for when once they begin to e&s;cape, they never &s;top till they think them&s;elves entirely out of danger, and will even &s;ometimes run for ten or twelve leagues.</P>
<P>The female &s;hews much attachment to her young, and even defends it again&s;t eagles, wolves, and other enemies; &s;he takes refuge in &s;ome cavern, and pre|&s;enting her head at the entrance of the hole, thus op|po&s;es the enemy.</P>
<P>When a bouquetin is &s;hot, the hunters let it cool upon the &s;pot, and then embowel it, putting the blood into one of the entrails, which is e&s;teemed by the pea&s;ants a &s;overeign remedy in pleuri&s;ies, and &s;ome other di&s;orders. A large bouquetin thus em|bowelled, will weigh 180 or 200 pounds. The horns are &s;ometimes found to weigh 16 or 18 pounds, and to be three feet in length.</P>
<P>Some naturali&s;ts are of opinion, that the diminu|tion of the bouquetin in the Alps, is owing to his &s;ize, the mon&s;trous length and weight of his horns, which impede him in his cour&s;e; becau&s;e he is dri|ven
<PB N="284" REF="323">
into places where he can &s;carcely procure &s;uffi|cient nouri&s;hment during great part of the year, when his &s;ight becomes debilitated, and is fre|quently lo&s;t, by the &s;trong reflections of the &s;un from the ice and &s;now. On the contrary, it is main|tained by others, that the bouquetin is endued with &s;trength proportionate to his &s;ize, and though he is inferior to the chamois in liveline&s;s and agility, yet he is by no means deficient in activity; that his horns, though large and weighty, yet from their re|clined po&s;ition, do not &s;eem to be any impediment, but rather render him e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice when he hap|pens to fall, or purpo&s;ely throws him&s;elf down pre|cipices, to avoid his pur&s;uers. They add al&s;o, that his natural food is rather lickens than herbs; that he is particularly fond of the young &s;hoots of trees and &s;hrubs; and that in all the places where he inhabits, he is found in the colde&s;t and rude&s;t mountains, and on the &s;teepe&s;t rocks. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is not improbable, that his pre&s;ent &s;ituation and manner of life, is an effect of nature, rather than nece&s;&s;ity. To account for the pre&s;ent &s;carcity of the bouquetins, we need only con&s;ider the number of its enemies, in men, bea&s;ts, and birds of prey. But allowing that the bouquetin was no longer found in his native Alps, &s;till we could not affirm, with &s;o much propriety, that the race was extinct, or that it had migrated into a milder climate, and
<PB N="285" REF="324">
with a &s;tate of dome&s;ticity, and more &s;ucculent food, had acquired &s;ofter manners, a form le&s;s rude, and &s;maller and &s;moother horns. For it is even not improbable that the <HI>hircus ferus</HI> of Belon, the bou|quetin of the Alps, the Siberian ibex, &s;o accurately de&s;cribed by <HI>Pallas,</HI> and the tame goat in all its different forms, are only varieties of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Helvetic Union.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to treat of the different cantons and the allied provinces of Switzer|land, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to give a comprehen&s;ive view of the origin of the Helvetic union, in order more readily to under&s;tand the divi&s;ion of this coun|try, and the connexions the cantons have with each other.</P>
<P>The ancient Helvetians were a Gaulick or Celtic people, and Helvetia, which received its name from
<PB N="286" REF="325">
them, was divided into four cantons or territories. <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> was the fir&s;t who reduced the inhabi|tants under the dominion of the Romans; which go|vernment continued till the fifth century, and then the country was over-run by the Burgundians and Germans.</P>
<P>While the greater part of Helvetia was &s;ubject to the Germans, the inhabitants of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, three of the 13 cantons of Switzer|land, had long enjoyed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable pri|vileges, particularly the right of being governed by their own magi&s;trates. During the 12th century, various di&s;putes between the&s;e three cantons and the Emperor, united them more firmly than ever: &s;uch was the &s;ituation at the death of the Emperor <HI>Frede|ric</HI> II. in 1250. From this period, or &s;oon after commenced the interregnum in the empire: during which time of anarchy and confu&s;ion, the nobles and bi&s;hops endeavouring to encroach upon the privileges of the people in the&s;e cantons, put them&s;elves under the protection of <HI>Rhodolph</HI> of Hap&s;burgh, who was elected to the Imperial throne in 1273. On the death of <HI>Rodolph,</HI> his &s;on <HI>Albert</HI> not only refu&s;ed to confirm the privileges granted them by his father, but likewi&s;e &s;et over them two noblemen of the mo&s;t infamous characters, who&s;e admini&s;tration became quite in&s;upportable. Find|ing
<PB N="287" REF="326">
that nothing le&s;s was in agitation, than the total deprivation of their liberties, they united in a firm re&s;olution to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity. They accordingly cho&s;e for commanders, three gentlemen of approved courage and abilities, who &s;ecretly agreed, that on the fir&s;t of January 1308, they &s;hould &s;urpri&s;e and demoli&s;h all the ca&s;tles, in which the Imperial governors re&s;ided.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution being effected, the&s;e three can|tons joined again in a league for ten years, which gave birth to the Helvetic union.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Albert,</HI> whil&s;t he was preparing to attack them, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by his nephew <HI>John</HI> of Hap&s;burgh. This a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination was committed the fir&s;t of May, 1308, in the open day, and in the &s;ight of his &s;on <HI>Leopold,</HI> and the re&s;t of his court. Its oc|ca&s;ion, and the circum&s;tances attending it are &s;in|gular. <HI>Albert</HI> as guardian to his nephew, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hereditary dominions in Switzerland, and refu&s;ed under various pretences, to deliver them up to him. At length, wearied with repeated and fruitle&s;s &s;olicitations, <HI>John</HI> entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t the Emperor, with <HI>Rhodolph de Warth, Ulrie de Palma, Walter de E&s;chenbach,</HI> and <HI>Conrad de Tagerfeld.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="327">The Emperor dined at Baden, in his way to Rheinfelden, a town in Suabia, where the Empre&s;s, his con&s;ort, had collected a con&s;iderable body of troops, with which he propo&s;ed invading the three cantons. Contemporary hi&s;torians, who have recorded the minute&s;t circum&s;tances in this whole tran&s;action, relate that <HI>Albert</HI> was in high &s;pirits during the re|pa&s;t; and that his nephew again entreating to be put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hereditary dominion, the Emperor, with an air of banter, placed a garland of flowers upon his head, adding at the &s;ame time, "This will be more &s;uitable to you, for the pre|&s;ent, than the cares of a trouble&s;ome government." This taunt had &s;uch an affect upon the young prince, that he bur&s;t into tears, flung away the flowers, and could not be prevailed upon to &s;it down to table.</P>
<P>After dinner, <HI>Albert</HI> continued his journey on hor&s;eback, accompanied by his &s;on <HI>Leopold,</HI> the con|&s;pirators, and his u&s;ual attendants; and came near the town of Windich, in the canton of Berne, to the Reu&s;s, over which river pa&s;&s;engers were u&s;ually $erried upon a raft. The con&s;pirators pa&s;&s;ed over fir&s;t, and were followed by <HI>Albert:</HI> as he was riding gently on, expecting his &s;on <HI>Leopold,</HI> and the re|mainder of his &s;uite, he was &s;uddenly be&s;et by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. One of them &s;eizing his hor&s;e's bridle,

<HEAD>The DEATH of ALBERT.</HEAD>

<PB N="289" REF="329">
<HI>John of Hap&s;burg</HI> reproached him for his inju&s;tice in detaining his dominions, and &s;truck him on the neck with his &s;word: <HI>Rhodolph de Warth</HI> wounded him in the &s;ide; and <HI>Ulrie de Palma</HI> clove his head with a &s;abre. In this condition they left him ex|piring on the ground. His &s;on and attendants, though witne&s;&s;es to the murder, not having pa&s;&s;ed the river, could not a&s;&s;i&s;t the emperor.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins e&s;caped into the cantons of Uri, Schweitz, and Underwalden, expecting to find a &s;ure a&s;ylum in a nation which <HI>Albert</HI> was preparing to invade. But the generous natives dete&s;ting a crime of &s;o atrocious a nature, although committed upon the per&s;on of their greate&s;t and mo&s;t formidable enemy, refu&s;ed to protect the murderers. <HI>De E&s;|chenbach</HI> concealed him&s;elf in the di&s;gui&s;e of a com|mon labourer, for 30 years, nor was his rank di&s;|covered, till he confe&s;&s;ed it upon his death bed; <HI>De Palma,</HI> de&s;titute of common nece&s;&s;aries, died in extreme poverty; and <HI>De Warth,</HI> tied to a hor&s;e's tail like a common malefactor, and dragged to the place of execution, was broken upon the wheel. <HI>John of Hap&s;burgh,</HI> commonly known by the name of the Parricide, from this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, did not reap the expected benefits of the crime; for by order of the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> VII. he retired into a mona&s;tery of Augu&s;tine Friars, where he died in 1313. Mean
<PB N="290" REF="330">
while, the three cantons were for a few years left to the undi&s;turbed enjoyment of their liberties, and to &s;trengthen them&s;elves again&s;t any future attack: and thus they innocently reaped the &s;ole advantage which was derived from this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>In 1315 however, <HI>Leopold,</HI> Duke of Au&s;tria, marched again&s;t the confederate cantons, at the head of 20,000 troops, and endeavouring to force his way into Schweitz, at the &s;traights of Morgarten, re|ceived a total defeat from 1,300 Swi&s;s, who were po&s;ted upon the mountains. In the &s;ame year, the three cantons contracted a perpetual alliance, which was ratified at Brunnen, and is the grand founda|tion of the Helvetic confederacy. Such were the feeble beginnings of a league, &s;ince become &s;o for|midable by the acce&s;&s;ion of ten more cantons, and by the additional &s;trength of its numerous allies; and it is remarkable, that Switzerland is the only country which on the one &s;ide, has confined the limits of the German empire; and on the other, has &s;et bounds to the French monarchy, which the latter has never tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The name of Schweitzerland, or Switzerland, which originally comprehended only the above three cantons, was afterwards extended to all Helvetia. It derived that appellation either from the canton
<PB N="291" REF="331">
of Schweitz, as having particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf in the revolution of 1308, and al&s;o at the battle of Morgarten; or becau&s;e the Au&s;trians called all the inhabitants of the&s;e mountainous parts, by the general denomination of Schweit|zers.</P>
<P>The acce&s;&s;ion of Zuric, Berne, Lucerne, Zug, and Glarus, which happened a few years after, gave &s;trength and &s;olidity to this union; but a century and a half elap&s;ed, before a new member was ad|mitted. At length in 1501, after much difficulty, Friburgh and Soleure were admitted into the league. Ba&s;le, Schafhau&s;en, and Appenzel, &s;oon after &s;ub|&s;cribed to the &s;ame terms.</P>
<P>The&s;e 13 towns and countries which properly con&s;titute the Helvetian republic, are united by a reciprocal convention; which, though not in all places the &s;ame; the union of the fir&s;t eight, and five &s;ub&s;equent cantons, differing in certain re&s;pects, yet in the principal points, they nearly agree.</P>
<P>It appears, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> from the &s;everal treaties concluded between the combined republics of Swit|zerland, that the Helvetic union is a perpetual de|fen&s;ive alliance between the 13 independent con|tracting powers, to protect each other by their united
<PB N="292" REF="332">
forces, again&s;t all foreign enemies. Accordingly, if any member of the union &s;hould be attacked, that particular canton has a right to demand &s;uccours from the whole confederate body; and in ca&s;e of war, the &s;everal forces to be &s;upplied by each can|ton, are preci&s;ely &s;pecified. It appears, however, from the &s;tipulations to which the five cantons agreed, that they do not enjoy equal prerogatives with the eight ancient cantons. For the latter have recovered to them&s;elves a right, if the que&s;tion for declaring war again&s;t any foreign &s;tate, &s;hould be unanimou&s;ly carried in their a&s;&s;embly, to require the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other five cantons, without a&s;|&s;igning the motive. It is further &s;tipulated, that if a rupture &s;hould en&s;ue between the eight cantons, the five are to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neutrality.</P>
<P>The next e&s;&s;ential object of the league, is to pre|&s;erve peace and good order. To this is added, a re|ciprocal guarantee of the forms of government, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the re&s;pective commonwealths. Ac|cordingly, the hi&s;tory of Switzerland affords many in&s;tances of protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, reciprocally given between the confederates, in defence and &s;up|port of the re&s;pective governments.</P>
<P>No &s;eparate engagement, which any of the cantons may conclude, can be valid, if incon&s;i&s;tent with the
<PB N="293" REF="333">
fundamental articles of this general union: that is, the reciprocal contract between the members of the league, &s;uper&s;edes every other con&s;ideration. With this exception, the &s;everal combined &s;tates are inde|pendent of each other: they may form alliances with any power, or reject the &s;ame, although the others have acceded to it; may grant auxiliary troops to foreign princes, may prohibit the money of the other cantons from being current within their own territories, may impo&s;e taxes, in &s;hort, may per|form every other act of ab&s;olute &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>The public affairs of the Helvetic body and their allies, are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and determined in their &s;everal diets a&s;&s;embled at Frauenfield in Thurgau. Each canton &s;ends as many deputies as it thinks proper.</P>
<P>It would be de&s;cending into a tedious detail to enter into the particular connections of the &s;everal allies, either with the whole Helvetic body, or with &s;ome of the cantons; and the different nature of the&s;e re&s;pective alliances. Suffice it to remark, that the allies may be divided into a&s;&s;ociate and confederate &s;tates; of the former, or a&s;&s;ociate &s;tates, are the ab|bot and town of S. Gallen, Bienne, and Mulhau&s;en; of the latter, or confederate &s;tates, are the Gri&s;ons, the republic of the Vallais, Geneva, Neuchatel, and the Bi&s;hop of Ba&s;le.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="334">The&s;e &s;tates thus compri&s;ed under the denomina|tion of a&s;&s;ociate and confederate, enjoy, by virtue of this union, a total independence of all foreign domi|nion; and partake of all the privileges and immu|nities granted to the Swi&s;s in other countries. And notwith&s;tanding the&s;e &s;tates are allied only with par|ticular cantons, yet if any of them &s;hould be attack|ed, tho&s;e cantons, with whom they are in treaty, would not only &s;upply them with &s;uccours, but would al&s;o require the joint a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the re|maining canton; if therefore, any part of the whole body &s;hould he invaded, all the other members would unite in its defence, either as immediate gua|rantees, or as auxiliaries of the actual guarrantees.</P>
<P>Having now given this &s;ummary hi&s;tory of the Helvetic union; we &s;hall proceed to treat of each &s;eparate canton, its cities, manners, cu&s;toms, laws, government, commerce, religion, &amp;c. noticing at the &s;ame time, the a&s;&s;ociate or confederate &s;tates with which it may be more immediately connected. We &s;hall begin with that of Bern, as being the mo&s;t populous and flouri&s;hing.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Town and Canton of Berne.</HEAD>
<P>THIS canton is by much the large&s;t, mo&s;t popu|lous, and mo&s;t fertile of any in Switzerland. It is about 120 miles in breadth, and 60 in length, form|ing in the whole, little le&s;s than one third of the confederacy. <HI>Scheuchzer</HI> &s;tiles this canton the mo&s;t valuable gem of all Switzerland. The levels yield an exuberance of grain and fruit, and the high lands afford rich pa&s;tures, covered with cattle of all kinds; con&s;equently the inhabitants are in no want of milk, butter, and chee&s;e. The fine&s;t &s;pots here, are the Waat, or <HI>pais de Vaud,</HI> and the country bor|dering on the lakes of Bienne, and Geneva, which yield not only the choice&s;t fruits, but al&s;o excellent wine.</P>
<P>Among the lakes here, the principal is that of Geneva; the greate&s;t part of which is within this canton. At pre&s;ent, either the whole lake is &s;tiled the lake of Geneva, or this appellation is limited to the we&s;tern part, the ea&s;tern being di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the lake of Lau&s;anne. Its extreme length is e&s;timated at 18 hours di&s;tance. Its greate&s;t
<PB N="296" REF="336">
breadth is between three and four hours, but towards both ends, it gradually decrea&s;es. Its depth al&s;o varies con&s;iderably, being towards Savoy from two to 400 hundred fathoms, but in mo&s;t parts, not ex|ceeding 40. Southward, not far from Bouveret, the river Rhine enters it with great rapidity, but quits it again at Geneva. That it pa&s;&s;es however, through the lake without mingling with it, as &s;ome ancient and modern writers have inadvertently a&s;|&s;erted, is unnatural; for though at about two or three miles from its entrance, the turbid waters of this river may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of the lake; yet beyond that di&s;tance, the di&s;tinction both in agitation and colour cea&s;es; the lake being every where &s;mooth, and of one uniform appearance. In &s;ummer, the waters of the lake are greatly in|crea&s;ed by the melting of the &s;now and ice in the mountains. The lake abounds in fi&s;h, and is parti|cularly famous for very large trouts, many of which, weigh between 40 and 50 pounds each; and all the &s;everal kinds of fi&s;h in it, are remarkable for their fine flavour.</P>
<P>The borders of the lake of Bienne are fruitful, and planted with many vineyards; and almo&s;t in its centre, &s;tand two &s;mall i&s;lands, the large&s;t of which, called S. <HI>Peters,</HI> is a delightful &s;pot, covered with meadows, vineyards, and a mo&s;t beautiful wood.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="337">This i&s;land, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> is about two miles in cir|cumference, and richly wooded with various &s;hrubs and trees. Its &s;urface is gently undulating; the &s;outhern &s;hore covered with herbage, forms a gra|dual &s;lope to the lake, the remaining borders are &s;teep and rocky; in a few places their &s;ummits are thinly fringed with &s;hrubs; in others their perpen|dicular &s;ides are clothed to the water's edge with hanging woods. Agreeable walks are carried through the woods and terminate at a circular pavilion placed in the centre of the i&s;land. During vintage particu|larly, and on Sunday, which is the u&s;ual day of fe&s;|tivity, the i&s;land is filled with parties who take re|fre&s;hments at the farm-hou&s;e, &s;tray about the woods, or dance the circular wal&s;e, which we &s;hall de&s;cribe hereafter.</P>
<P>It was in this farm-hou&s;e, the only dwelling in the i&s;land, that <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau</HI> occupied an apartment, when driven from Mortier in the di&s;trict of Neu|chatel, by the inhabitants, to whom he had made him&s;elf obnoxious from the &s;ceptici&s;m and infide|lity of his religious opinions. He lived with the &s;teward and his family, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> who are the pre|&s;ent inhabitants.

<PB N="298" REF="338">
chearful and agreeable; conver&s;ed with the family with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and complacency, and con|formed to their hours and manner of living; that he amu&s;ed him&s;elf entirely with wandering about the woods, and &s;earching for plants, which he u&s;ed to explain to them with &s;ingular &s;atisfaction. <HI>Rou&s;|&s;eau</HI> mentions his re&s;idence in this i&s;land with the highe&s;t terms of rapture, and his u&s;ual prone&s;s to exaggeration.</P>
<P>"I was permitted, &s;ays he, to remain only two months in this delightful i&s;land; but I could have pa&s;&s;ed there two years, two centuries, all eternity, without &s;uffering a moment's <HI>ennui,</HI> although my whole &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ted of the &s;teward and family, good but plain people. I e&s;teem the&s;e two months as the mo&s;t happy period of my life; and &s;o happy, that I could have pa&s;&s;ed my whole exi&s;tence with|out even a momentary wi&s;h for another &s;ituation."</P>
<P>If we examine in what this extreme happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted, he him&s;elf informs us, that his principal occupation was in doing nothing. He did not even unpack his books, and could &s;carcely prevail on him&s;elf to read, much le&s;s to an&s;wer any letters. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;teward and his &s;ervant at work in the vineyards and fields; &s;auntered about the woods, and gave him&s;elf up entirely to botany. He made occa&s;ional excur&s;ions on the lake, &s;ometimes coa&s;t|ing
<PB N="299" REF="339">
the &s;hady banks of the i&s;land; at other times &s;uffering the bark to float without direction into the middle of the lake: then, to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion, "he would lie down in the boat, look up to the heavens, and continue in that po&s;ture &s;everal hours, enjoying a thou&s;and unconnected and confu&s;ed, but delicious reveries." He frequently rowed to a &s;mall &s;andy i&s;land, which he de&s;cribes as a mo&s;t delicious &s;pot. It was one of his great amu&s;ements to people this little i&s;land with rabbits; and as he was con|veying with great pomp, the &s;teward's family to be pre&s;ent at the foundation of this little colony, he de&s;cribes him&s;elf as equally elated with the pilot of the Argonautic expedition.</P>
<P>From the&s;e &s;imple avocations and every day oc|currences, which <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau</HI> relates with that enthu|&s;ia&s;m and tho&s;e &s;entiments peculiar to him&s;elf, he draws the following &s;ublime morality:</P>
<P>"I have remarked during the vici&s;&s;itudes of a long life, that the mo&s;t delightful enjoyments and mo&s;t rapturous plea&s;ures, are not, upon recollec|tion, tho&s;e with which I am mo&s;t affected. Such fleeting moments of pa&s;&s;ion and delirium, however rapturous, are from their very nature but thinly &s;cattered in the path of life. They are too rare and rapid to con&s;titute a fixed &s;tate; and the happine&s;s
<PB N="300" REF="340">
which my heart regrets, is not compo&s;ed of fugi|tive in&s;tants, but con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;imple and permanent &s;tate, without rapture, the duration of which in|crea&s;es the charm, till it finds &s;upreme felicity."</P>
<P>This &s;tate he de&s;cribes him&s;elf as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing during his &s;hort continuation in the i&s;land of Bienne; a longer re&s;idence would probably have di&s;&s;olved the charm, which was rai&s;ed by his own heated imagi|nation. That re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of temper which is u&s;u|ally the attendant of great genius, and which was his in&s;eparable companion, would have probably returned, and embittered the delightful calm, which he de&s;cribes with &s;uch rapture and exta&s;y. But he had not time to become di&s;gu&s;ted with his &s;itua|tion: for the &s;ame intolerant &s;pirit which had hi|therto pur&s;ued him, followed him even to this &s;e|que&s;tered i&s;land; and he had &s;carcely pa&s;&s;ed two months, before he received an order from the go|vernment of Berne to depart from their territories. <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau</HI> was &s;o &s;hocked at this unexpected com|mand, that he petitioned to be impri&s;oned for life, only reque&s;ting the u&s;e of a few books, and that he might be occa&s;ionally permitted to walk in the open air. Soon after this extraordinary reque&s;t which &s;hews the extreme agitation of his mind, and which cannot but intere&s;t every feeling mind, he reluct|antly quitted the i&s;land. It does not fall within the
<PB N="301" REF="341">
compa&s;s of this work to dwell upon this &s;ingular man through the &s;ub&s;equent events of his life, or even accompany him to England, where, notwith|&s;tanding the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed reception, the &s;ame perver&s;ene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, and the &s;ame exce&s;&s;ive delicacy, rendered him no le&s;s unhappy, than when he was under the pre&s;&s;ure of real calamities, and expo&s;ed to reiterated per&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>The canton of Berne is well cultivated and very populous, containing 39 large and &s;mall towns, and above 1300 villages. Its &s;ubjects are com|puted at no le&s;s than 400,000, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be nearly one fourth part of the population of all Switzerland. Its territories are &s;aid to comprize nearly one third part.</P>
<P>The principal towns in this canton are Berne and Lau&s;anne. Berne is a regular well-built town with &s;ome air of magnificence. It is &s;ituated on the river Aar, by which three &s;ides of it are envi|roned, forming a penin&s;ula. The hou&s;es are of a fine white free-&s;tone and pretty uniform, particu|larly in the principal &s;treet, where they are all ex|actly of the &s;ame height. There are piazzas on each &s;ide, with a walk, rai&s;ed four feet above the level of the &s;treet, very commodious in wet wea|ther.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="342">A &s;mall branch of the river Aar has been turned into this &s;treet, and being confined to a narrow channel in the middle, which has a con&s;iderable &s;lope, it runs with great rapidity; and without be|ing a di&s;agreeable object in it&s;elf, is of great &s;er|vice in keeping the &s;treets clean.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance contributes to render this one of the mo&s;t cleanly towns in Europe:&mdash;Crimi|nals are employed in removing rubbi&s;h from the &s;treets and public walks. The more atrocious de|linquents are chained to waggons, while tho&s;e who are condemned for &s;maller crimes, are employed in &s;weeping the light rubbi&s;h into the rivulet, and throwing the heavier into the carts or waggons, which their more criminal companions are obliged to pu&s;h or draw along.</P>
<P>The&s;e wretches have collars of iron fixed round their necks, with a projecting handle in the form of a hook to each, by which on the &s;lighte&s;t of|fence or mutiny, they may be &s;eized, and are en|tirely at the command of the guard, who&s;e duty it is to &s;ee that they perform their work. People of both &s;exes are condemned to this labour, for months, years, or for le&s;s, according to the nature of their crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="343">It is alledged, that be&s;ides deterring from crimes which is effected by this means, in common with the other methods of puni&s;hment, there is the addi|tional advantage of obliging the criminal to repair by his labour, the injury which he has done to the community.</P>
<P>The public buildings at Berne, as the ho&s;pital, the granary, the guard-hou&s;e, the ar&s;enal, and the churches, are magnificent. There has al&s;o lately a very elegant building been erected, with accommo|dations for many public amu&s;ements, &s;uch as balls, concerts, and theatrical entertainments. There are likewi&s;e apartments for private &s;ocieties and a&s;&s;em|blies. It was built by a voluntary &s;ub&s;cription among the nobility; and no &s;ocieties, but of the patrician order, are allowed there.</P>
<P>Theatrical entertainments are &s;eldom permitted at Berne; none had been performed at the new the|atre, when <HI>Moore</HI> pa&s;&s;ed through this city, though the building had been &s;ome time erected..</P>
<P>The walk by the great church, was formerly the only public walk, and univer&s;ally admired on ac|count of the view from it, and the peculiarity of its &s;ituation, being on a level with the &s;treets on one &s;ide, and &s;ome hundred feet of perpendicular height
<PB N="304" REF="344">
above them on the other. But there is now ano|ther public walk, at &s;ome di&s;tance without the town, which has been lately made upon a high bank, by the &s;ide of the Aar, and is the mo&s;t magnificent one belonging to this or any other town. From it there is a commanding view of the river, the town of Berne, the country about it, and the glaciers of Switzerland.</P>
<P>The public library is a &s;mall, but well cho&s;en collection, and contains 20,000 volumes, a cabinet of Swi&s;s coins and medals, and many curious ma|nu&s;cripts. An addition was lately made to this li|brary, by a collection of Engli&s;h books, magnifi|cently bound, which were &s;ent as a pre&s;ent by an Engli&s;h gentleman; who, though he has thought proper to conceal his name, has &s;ufficiently di&s;covered his political principles, by the nature of the collec|tion; among&s;t which are, <HI>Milton's</HI> works, particu|larly his pro&s;e writings; <HI>Algernon Sidney</HI> on Govern|ment, <HI>Lock, Ludlow's</HI> Memoirs, <HI>Gordon's</HI> Tran&s;la|tion of <HI>Tacitus, Addi&s;on's</HI> works, particularly the Freeholder; <HI>Marvel's</HI> works, <HI>Steel's,</HI> &amp;c. They were the large&s;t and fine&s;t editions, and might be about the value of 200 pounds. This gentleman made a pre&s;ent of the &s;ame nature to the public li|brary at Geneva.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="345">The ar&s;enal contains arms for 60,000 men, and a con&s;iderable quantity of cannon, which are ca&s;t in the town. The Bernois value them&s;elves much on the trophies contained in this building, and upon the quantity, good condition, and arrangement of the arms.</P>
<P>Nothing intere&s;ted me &s;o much, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> as the figures of the brave Switzers, who fir&s;t took arms again&s;t tyranny, and that of <HI>William Tell,</HI> who is repre&s;ented aiming the apple at his &s;on's head. I contemplated this with an emotion cre|ated by the circum&s;tances of the &s;tory, not by the workman&s;hip; for at that moment I &s;hould have beheld with neglect the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;tatue ever formed of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>Surely no characters have &s;o ju&s;t a claim to the ad|miration and gratitude of po&s;terity, as tho&s;e who have freed their countrymen from the capricious in&s;olence of tyrants; and whether all the incidents of <HI>Tell's</HI> &s;tory be true or fabulous, the men, who|ever they were, who rou&s;ed and incited their fellow-citizens to throw off the Au&s;trian yoke, de&s;erve to be regarded as patriots, having undoubtedly been actuated by that principle, &s;o dear to every generous heart, the &s;pirit of independence.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="346"><HI>Addi&s;on</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that there is no great plea|&s;ure in vi&s;iting ar&s;enals, merely to &s;ee a repetition of the&s;e magazines of war; yet it is worth while, as it gives an idea of the force of a &s;tate, and &s;erves to fix in the mind the mo&s;t important parts of its hi&s;|tory.</P>
<P>The arms taken from the Burgundians, in the va|rious battles which e&s;tabli&s;hed the liberties of Swit|zerland, are di&s;played here; al&s;o the figure of the General of Berne, who, in the year 1536, con|quered the Pays de Vaud from <HI>Charles</HI> III. Duke of Savoy: and if they have no trophies to &s;hew of a later date, it is becau&s;e they are too poor and too wi&s;e to aim at any exten&s;ion of dominion.</P>
<P>The charitable in&s;titutions of Berne, are numerous, liberal, and well directed. The ho&s;pitals are in ge|neral large, clean, and airy; and in the alms-hou&s;e for the reception of 50 poor citizens, is a curious e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;imilar to one at Ba&s;le. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed travellers are treated with a meal and a lodging, if at night, and receive &s;ix-pence on their departure. If &s;ick or wounded, they are maintained till their recovery is e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The external appearance of the ho&s;pital of Berne, &s;ays <HI>De l'Angle,</HI> &s;eems to announce the palace of a
<PB N="307" REF="347">
&s;overeign. This magnificence is perhaps reprehen|&s;ible more e&s;pecially in a republic. What is want|ing for the &s;ick? Convenience, cleanline&s;s, &s;alubrity &mdash;nothing more. The ho&s;pital of Berne re-unites all the&s;e advantages. The mo&s;t generous huma|nity, and the &s;tricte&s;t regularity pre&s;ide over the admini&s;tration of this charity. The greate&s;t care and attention is paid to the patient; every one has a bed to him&s;elf; every bed has proper curtains, and a couple of mattra&s;&s;es; and no &s;mell, either good or bad, is perceptible in the apartments.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of correction, which when the bene|volent <HI>Howard</HI> vi&s;ited Berne, was in &s;o deplorable a &s;tate, is now extremely well regulated. Formerly, all delinquents, without di&s;tinction of crime, were confined in the &s;ame place; but they are now &s;epa|rated; and two hou&s;es are e&s;tabli&s;hed, one called the hou&s;e of correction for greater crimes, and the other the hou&s;e of labour for &s;maller mi&s;demeanors. The pri&s;oners are al&s;o di&s;criminated by the appella|tions of brown and blue, from the colour of their clothes, with which they are &s;upplied <HI>gratis,</HI> during the term of their confinement. The brown co|lour is appropriate to the hou&s;e of correction, the blue to the hou&s;e of labour. The men and women are lodged in &s;eparate apartments. Both are con|&s;tantly employed, &s;ometimes in cleaning the &s;treets
<PB N="308" REF="348">
and other &s;ervile occupations; at other times they are taught to read and write, and are in&s;tructed in various trades, which may a&s;&s;i&s;t them in gaining a maintenance at the expiration of the term for which they are &s;entenced to hard labour. By the&s;e means, the expence of the e&s;tabli&s;hment is nearly &s;up|ported; and an hone&s;t livelihood a&s;&s;ured to tho&s;e, who would otherwi&s;e prove u&s;ele&s;s or pernicious members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>There are four tables at which the re&s;pective &s;eats are a mark of di&s;tinction, appropriated to good be|haviour; and a larger or le&s;&s;er &s;hare of provi&s;ion is di&s;tributed to each, in proportion to their indu&s;|try. After having earned their food, the pri&s;oners in the hou&s;e of labour, receive 10 <HI>per cent;</HI> tho&s;e in the hou&s;e of correction, eight <HI>per cent.</HI> for their extra work.</P>
<P>Public ju&s;tice is wi&s;ely and impartially admi|ni&s;tered; and the torture which had for &s;ome time fallen into di&s;u&s;e, is now formally aboli&s;hed by a public act of government. This humane act, forms a di&s;tingui&s;hed aera in the hi&s;tory of Swi&s;s juri&s;pru|dence; as the example of &s;o powerful and wi&s;e a government, cannot fail producing a general influ|ence; and it is to be hoped, will be the prelude to its abolition throughout Switzerland.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="349">The &s;olemnity u&s;ed in pa&s;&s;ing capital &s;entence on a criminal, de&s;erves to be mentioned and imitated. The trial being fini&s;hed, the pri&s;oner is informed of his condemnation by the Lieutenant or principal officer of the police, and attended by two clergy|men, who prepare him for death. On the day ap|pointed for execution, a large &s;caffolding, covered with a black canopy, is con&s;tructed in the middle of the principal &s;treet. The Advoyer, or chief of the republic, with a &s;ceptre in his hand, is &s;eated on an elevated kind of throne, between two &s;enators, and attended by the Chancellor and the Lieutenant of the police, holding an iron &s;tick, called the <HI>rod of blood,</HI> all habited in their official robes. The cri|minal being brought to the foot of the &s;caffolding without chains, the Chancellor reads aloud the &s;en|tence of condemnation, at the conclu&s;ion of which, the Advoyer bids the executioner approach. The latter in&s;tantly binds the arms of the culprit, and leads him to the place of execution.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme power is lodged in the great coun|cil, which, including the le&s;&s;er council, is &s;tiled the Council and Burghery of the city of Berne. By an old act, it is not to con&s;i&s;t of le&s;s than 200 members, and when complete, their number amounts to 299, but never to 300; though it is but &s;eldom al&s;o that it is &s;o full, 80 or more generally dying before their
<PB N="310" REF="350">
places are filled up. This council makes war, peace, and alliances, manages the upper and lower regalia, and all matters relating to the finances; it cho&s;es the le&s;&s;er council, and its members al&s;o pre&s;ide in all capital cau&s;es, for crimes committed within the di&s;|trict of the city, and likewi&s;e in civil cau&s;es, when the &s;um in debate exceeds 500 pounds.</P>
<P>The great council is generally filled up every ten years; as within that period, there is u&s;ually a defi|ciency of 80 members to complete the whole num|ber of 299; a new election can only be propo&s;ed on a vacancy of 80; and cannot be deferred, when there is a deficiency of 100. The vacancies are &s;up|plied by the &s;uffrages of the &s;enate.</P>
<P>The &s;everal bailiffs are repre&s;entatives of the &s;o|vereign power in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts. They enforce the edicts of government; collect the pub|lic revenues; act as ju&s;tices of the peace; and are judges in civil and criminal cau&s;es, except where there is any local juri&s;diction. In civil cau&s;es, be|yond a certain value, an appeal lies to the courts of Berne: in criminal affairs, the proce&s;s is made out in the bailiffs court, undergoes a re-vi&s;ion in the &s;e|nate, and is referred to the criminal chamber, which inflicts puni&s;hment for &s;mall mi&s;demeanors. In capital ca&s;es, the &s;entence mu&s;t be confirmed by the
<PB N="311" REF="351">
&s;enate, and by the &s;overeign council, if the delin|quent is a citizen of Bern.</P>
<P>Although there are no &s;tanding armies in Swit|zerland, yet in many of the cantons, and particu|larly in Berne, the militia is &s;o well regulated, that government could a&s;&s;emble a very con&s;iderable body of men, at a moment's warning. To this end, every male at the age of 16, is enrolled in the militia; and about a third of the whole number are formed into particular regiments, compo&s;ed of fu&s;ileers and electionaries; the former con&s;i&s;ting of bachelors, and the latter of married men. Every per&s;on thus enrolled, is obliged to provide him&s;elf, at his own expence, with a uniform, a mu&s;ket, and a certain quantity of powder and ball: and no pea&s;ant is al|lowed to marry, unle&s;s he produces his uniform and arms. Every year, a certain number of officers are deputed by the council of war, to in&s;pect the arms of the &s;oldiers; to complete the regiments; to exerci&s;e the militia; and, upon their return, they make their report to the council. Be&s;ide this an|nual review, the regiments are occa&s;ionally ex|erci&s;ed by veteran &s;oldiers, appointed for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the arms in the ar&s;enal of Berne, a cer|tain quantity is al&s;o provided, in the ar&s;enal of each
<PB N="312" REF="352">
bailliage, &s;ufficient for the militia of that di&s;trict; and likewi&s;e a &s;um of money, amounting to three months pay, which is appropriated to the electiona|ries in ca&s;e of actual &s;ervice. The dragoons are cho&s;en from the &s;ub&s;tantial farmers; as each per&s;on is obliged to provide his hor&s;e and accoutrements. In time of peace, the Advoyer out of office, is pre|&s;ident of the council of war, and a member of that council, is commander of the militia in the Pays de Vaud; but during a war, a general in chief is nominated, who commands the forces of the re|public.</P>
<P>A certain number of regiments, being thus al|ways in readine&s;s, &s;ignals are fixed on the highe&s;t part of each bailliage, for a&s;&s;embling the militia at a particular place in each di&s;trict; where they re|ceive orders for marching.</P>
<P>The whole power of the government, and all the honourable offices of &s;tate, are in the hands of the nobility. As they are not permitted to trade, they would naturally fall into poverty, did not the num|ber of places, which the nobles enjoy, and to which very con&s;iderable pen&s;ions are annexed, enable the poore&s;t of them to &s;upport their families with dig|nity.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="353">The bailliages into which the whole canton and the conquered territories are divided, form lucra|tive and honourable e&s;tabli&s;hments for the princi|pal families of Berne. The bailiff is governor and judge in his own di&s;trict, and there is a magnificent chateau in each for his accommodation. An ap|peal may be made from all &s;ubordinate courts to him, as al&s;o from his dominion, to the council at Berne.</P>
<P>The nobility of Berne, though born to be judges, are not always in&s;tructed in law. It has, therefore, been thought requi&s;ite, to appoint a certain number of per&s;ons, as their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, who have been bred to the profe&s;&s;ion. But in ca&s;e the judges &s;hould differ from the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, as the nobles have the precedence of the lawyers, the deci&s;ion mu&s;t be given accord|ing to their directions.</P>
<P>This office remains in the hands of the &s;ame per|&s;on for the term of &s;ix years only. In &s;ome of the&s;e bailliages, it is &s;aid, the governor may live with proper magnificence, and lay up, during the period of his continuing in office, two or 3000 pounds, without extortion. There is no law again&s;t his being afterwards named to another bailliage.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="354">The executive power of the government being thus in the hands of the nobility, together with all the lucrative and honourable offices, it may be ima|gined, that the middle and lower ranks of people are oppre&s;&s;ed. But this is by no means the ca&s;e; for the citizens, that is, the merchants and trades-people &s;eem in general to enjoy all the comforts and conveniences of life. And the pea&s;antry is un|commonly wealthy through the whole canton of Berne.</P>
<P>The Swi&s;s have no objection to their nobles be|ing their judges, and to the principal offices of go|vernment remaining in their hands. They look upon the nobility as their natural &s;uperiors, and think, that they and their families ought to be &s;up|ported with a certain degree of &s;plendor. But the power of direct taxation, is a different que&s;tion, and mu&s;t be managed with all po&s;&s;ible caution and de|licacy. It is a common cau&s;e, and the conduct of the nobles, in this particular, is watched with very jealous eyes. They are &s;ufficiently aware of this, and u&s;e their power with moderation. But le&s;t the nobles &s;hould at any time forget, a very good hint is given in a German in&s;cription of the ar&s;enal, im|plying, that the in&s;olence and rapacity of high rank, had brought about the liberty of Switzerland.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="355">A people who have always arms in their hands, and form the only military force of the country, are in no danger of being oppre&s;&s;ed and irritated with taxes.</P>
<P>It has been con&s;idered by many, as a pernicious policy in the Swi&s;s, to allow &s;uch a con&s;iderable number of the natives to &s;erve as mercenaries in the different armies of Europe. There are others who con&s;ider this mea&s;ure as expedient or le&s;s pernicious in the Swi&s;s cantons, than it would be in any other country.</P>
<P>They who &s;upport this opinion, a&s;&s;ert, that every part of Switzerland, which is capable of cultivation, is already improved to the highe&s;t degree; and that after retaining a &s;ufficient number of hands, to keep it always in this condition, and the &s;upport of every manufactory, &s;till there remains a &s;urplus of inhabi|tants, which form the troops that are allowed to go into foreign &s;ervice. They add, that the&s;e troops engage for a limited number of years; at the expi|ration of which, many of them return, with money, to their native country; and all, by &s;tipulation, may be re-called on any emergency. By this means, they retain a numerous and well di&s;ciplined army, which &s;o far from being a burden, in reality, enriches the
<PB N="316" REF="356">
&s;tate; an advantage, which no other people ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another motive for this mea&s;ure, which, though it be not openly avowed, yet perhaps has con&s;iderable weight: the council may be afraid, that if the young nobility were kept at home, where they could have but few objects to occupy them, they might cabal and &s;pread di&s;&s;entions in the &s;tate; or perhaps through idlene&s;s and ambition, excite dangerous in&s;urrections among the pea&s;ants. For although the laws are &s;evere again&s;t &s;tate crimes, and ea&s;ily put in execution again&s;t ordinary offenders; it might be difficult and dangerous to puni&s;h a popu|lar young nobleman.</P>
<P>It may on the&s;e accounts be highly prudent to allow a large proportion of them to exhau&s;t, in &s;ome foreign &s;ervice, the fiery and re&s;tle&s;s years of youth, which at home might have been &s;pent in faction and dangerous intrigue. Very probably the &s;tate would incline to permit the officers to go, while they retained the private men at home; but they are under the nece&s;&s;ity of allowing the latter likewi&s;e to go, as without them, the officers could not be rai&s;ed to tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ituations in foreign &s;ervices, which are their greate&s;t inducements to leave their own country.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="357">After having &s;erved a certain term of years, they almo&s;t all return to Switzerland. Some, becau&s;e they are tired of di&s;&s;ipation; others, to inherit a pa|ternal e&s;tate; and many with pen&s;ions from the princes they have &s;erved. The heat of youth is then mo&s;t probably pa&s;&s;ed, and they begin to a&s;pire to tho&s;e offices in their own country, to which their birth gives them a claim, and which they now pre|fer to the lu&s;tre of military rank. They either wi&s;h to &s;upport tho&s;e laws and that government, which they find &s;o partial to their families; or they de&s;ire to pa&s;s the remainder of their days in ea&s;e and re|tirement on their paternal e&s;tates.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that the Swi&s;s officers who re|turn from foreign &s;ervices, particularly that of France, in&s;tead of importing French manners to their native mountains, and infecting their country|men with the luxuries and fopperies of that nation; throw off all foreign airs with their uniforms, and immediately re&s;ume the plain and frugal &s;tyle of life, which prevails in their own country.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Cu&s;toms, Manners, and Environs of Berne.</HEAD>
<P>AT Berne, the &s;ociety is extremely agreeable, and foreigners are received with great ea&s;e and po|litene&s;s. The men do not meet in &s;eparate &s;ocieties; and the women are the life and ornament of their daily a&s;&s;emblies. The&s;e a&s;&s;emblies begin about four or five in the afternoon, and continue till about eight, when the parties retire to their re&s;pective hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Dancing is a very frequent amu&s;ement at Berne. There is a public ball every fortnight; and in win|ter, &s;carcely an evening pa&s;&s;es without one. The&s;e diver&s;ions commence at &s;o early an hour as five in the afternoon, on account of a &s;tanding order from government, which prohibits their continuance after eleven. Engli&s;h country dances are commonly introduced, but the Wal&s;e, which is a &s;pecies of allemande, is the favourite dance of the natives. The parties arrange them&s;elves in di&s;tinct couples, and follow each other in a circular direction; the gentleman turning his partner with great velocity.
<PB N="319" REF="359">
The life and &s;pirit of their dances, &s;trike a foreigner with a&s;toni&s;hment, and can &s;carcely be conceived by tho&s;e who have never &s;een them. The gaiety of the&s;e parties is &s;till more enlivened during the &s;um|mer months, when the natives re&s;ort to a garden near the town, and dance under an open pavilion, amid &s;cenes of rural fe&s;tivity. The foreigner who prefers the con&s;tant intercour&s;e of company to a more tranquil &s;ociety, will chu&s;e the re&s;idence of Berne, rather than that of any other town in Swit|zerland.</P>
<P>There is but little trade in the capital; &s;ome few manufactures, indeed, chiefly of linen and &s;ilk, have been e&s;tabli&s;hed; but are carried on by tho&s;e only, who have no pro&s;pect of being admitted into the &s;overeign council. For tho&s;e families who enjoy any influence in public affairs, would hold them|&s;elves degraded, by engaging in any branch of com|merce; one general advantage, however, is derived from this anti-commercial &s;pirit: the members of government, not being intere&s;ted in laying re&s;tric|tions on trade, do not, as at Zuric and Ba&s;le, confine the exclu&s;ive right of e&s;tabli&s;hing manufactures to the burghers of the capital; but wi&s;ely extend that permi&s;&s;ion to all their &s;ubjects, without di&s;tinction of rank or place. From this circum&s;tance, in con|junction with the mildne&s;s and wi&s;dom of govern|ment,
<PB N="320" REF="360">
ari&s;e that comfortable &s;tate, and even wealth, which &s;o peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hes the pea&s;antry in the whole canton of Berne; and to the natural re|&s;ult of the&s;e wi&s;e regulations, may be naturally im|puted the attachment of government, particularly ob&s;ervable in the German di&s;trict.</P>
<P>Sumptuary laws are in force throughout this can|ton; and the wearing of gold, &s;ilver, lace, &amp;c. even of &s;ilk, is expre&s;sly prohibited. The chamber of reform has found it nece&s;&s;ary, however, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, to relax the vigour of the&s;e laws. Indeed, the va&s;t &s;trides which luxury has made within this century, is very perceivable throughout Switzerland: and there is no place where its progre&s;s has been more rapid than at Berne. The attention of go|vernment has not been wanting to re&s;train it; as ap|pears by the laws that have been repeatedly enacted for that purpo&s;e: an attention, however, which in many in&s;tances, has not proved altogether &s;ucce&s;sful; notwith&s;tanding the &s;overeign council has given the &s;everal fines to the members of the chamber of re|form. In one re&s;pect, however, their laudable en|deavours have been more effectual. Not long ago, the &s;pirit of gaming had ari&s;en in Berne to &s;uch an extravagant height, as to have overwhelmed &s;everal families in total ruin. Upon this occa&s;ion, the &s;o|vereign council interpo&s;ed its authority by very
<FIGURE>
<PB REF="361">
<HEAD>SWISS PEASANTS.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="321" REF="362">
&s;alutary regulations; and, in order to enforce the ob&s;ervance of them more &s;trictly, every member of that council is bound by an oath, to inform again&s;t any tran&s;gre&s;&s;or that comes within his ob&s;ervation. By this law, all games of chance are expre&s;sly pro|hibited; and in other kind of games, the parties are re&s;trained from playing for more than a certain &s;um, particularly &s;pecified.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the pea&s;ants in this canton, as &s;een at a fair near Berne, is thus de&s;cribed by <HI>Coxe.</HI> Great numbers of the men have long beards; and many of them cover their heads with a woman's &s;traw hat, extremely broad, which gives them a very gro|te&s;que appearance: their dre&s;s is chiefly a coar&s;e brown cloth jacket, without &s;leeves; with large puffed breeches of ticking. The women wear their hair plaited behind, in tre&s;&s;es, with the rib|band hanging down below the wai&s;t: a flat plain &s;traw hat, which is very becoming; a red or brown cloth jacket without &s;leeves; a black or blue pet|ticoat bordered with red, and &s;carcely reaching be|low their knees; red &s;tockings with black clocks, and no heels to their &s;hoes; their &s;hifts, fa&s;tened clo&s;e round the throat by a black collar, with red ornaments; the better &s;ort have chains of &s;ilver between the &s;houlders, brought round under each
<PB N="322" REF="363">
arm, and fa&s;tened beneath the bo&s;om, the ends hanging down with &s;ome &s;ilver ornaments.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that the pea&s;ants who have acquired opulence, either by manufactures or agriculture, &s;eldom quit their &s;ituation; they con|tinue in the &s;ame habits which they contracted in the earlier period of life, and however wealthy, never give their daughters in marriage, but to per&s;ons of their own de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Learning is neither &s;o univer&s;ally encouraged, nor &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated here, as at Zurie; the academical &s;tudies are almo&s;t &s;olely directed to tho&s;e branches of knowledge, more e&s;&s;entially ne|ce&s;&s;ary for entering into the church. The &s;ociety for the promotion of agriculture, was, till within the&s;e few years, almo&s;t the only e&s;tabli&s;hment that di|rectly tends to the progre&s;s of the arts and &s;ciences. A literary &s;ociety, has, however, &s;ince been in&s;ti|tuted for the promotion of phy&s;ic and natural hi&s;|tory in general, and that of Switzerland in particu|lar. In January, 1788, this &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ted of ten members, re&s;ident at Berne, of whom &s;everal po&s;|&s;e&s;s, and others are forming collections, agreeable to the plan of the in&s;titution. The members have e&s;tabli&s;hed regular corre&s;pondence in various parts of Europe, and are ready to an&s;wer the enquiries
<PB N="323" REF="364">
of foreign naturali&s;ts, who wi&s;h to be informed con|cerning any points, which relate to the natural hi&s;tory of this country. An in&s;titution founded on &s;uch liberal and exten&s;ive principles, and having one object principally in view, cannot fail to render the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to &s;cience.</P>
<P>The environs of Berne, are in general extremely delightful, and there is no road which exhibits a more plea&s;ing variety of hill and dale, than that which leads to Thun. It runs through an agree|able country; winds through fertile meadows, en|riched with dark fore&s;ts of pine and fir, and occa|&s;ional groves of beech and oak. The well being of the inhabitants is vi&s;ible from the cultivation of the grounds, and the number and neatne&s;s of the cot|tages and farm-hou&s;es, which are &s;cattered about the fields, &s;kirted by trees, or half concealed amid tufts of wood.</P>
<P>About four miles from Berne, is the village of Hindelbank, which is generally vi&s;ited by travellers, to view the tomb of <HI>Madame Langhan's,</HI> a mo&s;t celebrated work of <HI>Nahl,</HI> a Swedi&s;h &s;culptor. Be|ing employed in con&s;tructing a &s;epulchre for Count de <HI>Erlach,</HI> he was lodged in the hou&s;e of the cler|gyman, his particular friend, who&s;e wife, a woman of uncommon beauty, expired in child-bed on
<PB N="324" REF="365">
Ea&s;ter-eve. Struck with the time of her death, ani|mated by the recollection of her beauty, and &s;ym|pathi&s;ing with the affliction of her hu&s;band, he con|ceived and fini&s;hed this affecting monument. It is placed in the body of the church, &s;unk into the pavement like a grave, and covered with two folding doors. When the&s;e are opened, a grave-&s;tone ap|pears, as if ju&s;t rent into three fractures, through which is half di&s;covered the figure of a woman, &s;lightly veiled with a &s;hroud. She is repre&s;ented at the moment of the re&s;urrection, when, <HI>"The graves are commanded to yield up their dead."</HI> With her right hand, &s;he is gently rai&s;ing that portion of the broken grave &s;tone which lies over her head; and in the other, holds a naked infant, &s;truggling with its little hands to relieve it&s;elf from the tomb. <HI>"Here am I, Lord, and the child whom thou gave&s;t me,"</HI> are the &s;ublime words which form the in&s;cription. Below is the name of the decea&s;ed; <HI>Anna Magdalena Langhans,</HI> wife of the clergyman: born 1723; died 1751. The workman&s;hip is by no means inferior to the original de&s;ign. The arti&s;t has formed the whole &s;epulchre out of one block, and &s;o naturally expre&s;&s;ed the &s;welling of the &s;tone, that the fragments &s;eem as if they had ju&s;t bur&s;t, and were in the act of opening.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="366">Nothing, perhaps, can more &s;trongly di&s;play the &s;uperior effect of &s;implicity over magnificence, than the companion of this tomb, with the mau&s;oleum of Count de <HI>Erlach,</HI> in the &s;ame church. The latter con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal marble figures, executed in a ma&s;terly &s;tile, and loaded with all the emblems of rank and opulence, &s;carcely attracts a momentary attention; while this &s;imple grave-&s;tone <HI>"&s;peaks home"</HI> to the heart of every per&s;on of ta&s;te and feeling.</P>
<P>Morat, another town in the environs of this capi|tal, is celebrated for the ob&s;tinate &s;iege it &s;u&s;tained again&s;t <HI>Charles the Bold,</HI> Duke of Burgundy, which was followed by the battle of Morat, fought on the 22d of June, 1476. In this famous engagement, the Duke was routed, and his whole army almo&s;t en|tirely de&s;troyed by the confederatet roops of Swit|zerland. Not far from the town, and adjoining to the high road, a monument of this victory &s;till re|mains: it is a &s;quare building, filled with the bones of the Burgundian &s;oldiers, who were &s;lain at the &s;iege, and in the battle. To judge from the quan|tity of the&s;e bones, the number of the &s;laughtered mu&s;t have been con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>"And what," &s;ays <HI>Philip de Comines,</HI> "was the occa&s;ion of this war? It was begun on an account
<PB N="326" REF="367">
of a waggon of &s;heep-&s;kins, which the Lord of Ro|mont took from a Swi&s;s, who was pa&s;&s;ing through his territories. If God had not abandoned the Duke, it is not probable, that he would have put him&s;elf into &s;o much danger, for &s;o trifling a cir|cum&s;tance; con&s;idering the offers that were made to him; again&s;t what &s;ort of people he was engaged; and from whence neither profit nor glory could accrue to him. For the Swi&s;s were not in &s;uch re|pute, as they are at pre&s;ent, and nothing could be poorer: in&s;omuch, that one of their amba&s;&s;adors, as he was endeavouring to prevent the Duke from engaging in that war, remon&s;trated, that he could get nothing by attacking them: for, their country was &s;o barren, that the &s;purs of his troops, and the bits of their hor&s;es, were worth more than could be furni&s;hed by all the Swi&s;s territories, in ca&s;e they were conquered."</P>
<P>The borders of the lake of Morat, are enriched with gentlemen's hou&s;es, and villages in great abundance. <HI>Pennant</HI> ob&s;erves, that the va&s;t fi&s;h, called the <HI>&s;ilurus glanis,</HI> or the <HI>&s;aluth,</HI> which fre|quents the lakes of Morat and Neuchatel, has not been caught here in the memory of man. It is well de&s;cribed, and finely engraven in <HI>Block's</HI> Hi&s;tory of Fi&s;hes. In the time of <HI>Ge&s;ner,</HI> two were taken, one of which was eight feet long, but they are &s;ome|times
<PB N="327" REF="368">
&s;o large, as to weigh &s;ix hundred pounds. It is an eel-&s;haped fi&s;h, very &s;mooth, round and thick, and has a great head. The mouth is furni&s;hed with four &s;hort, and two very long whi&s;kers. It is very inactive and &s;low in its motions, and loves the deep and muddy parts of the lakes. They are found in many of the great fre&s;h waters of Europe, and abun|dantly in the Volga.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s, manners, and per&s;ons of the inhabi|tants of this part of the canton, differ from tho&s;e on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. They are very tall and robu&s;t. Their dre&s;&s;es very particular. They wear little round hats, like tho&s;e of the Dutch &s;kippers. Their coats and wai&s;tcoats are all of a kind of coar&s;e black cloth. Their breeches made of coar&s;e linen, are &s;omething like &s;ailors trow&s;ers; but drawn together in plaits below the knees, and the &s;tockings are of the &s;ame &s;tuff with the breeches.</P>
<P>The women wear &s;hort jackets, with a great &s;u|perfluity of bottons. The unmarried women value them&s;elves on the length of their hair, which they &s;eparate into two divi&s;ions, and allow to hang at its full length, braided with ribbands in the Ramillie fa&s;hion. After marriage, the&s;e tre&s;&s;es are no longer permitted to hang down; but being twi&s;ted round the head in &s;piral lines, are fixed at the crown with
<PB N="328" REF="369">
large &s;ilver pins. This is the only difference in point of dre&s;s, which matrimony makes.</P>
<P>Married and unmarried wear &s;traw hats, orna|mented with black ribbands. So far their dre&s;s is becoming enough; but they have an aukward man|ner of fixing their petticoats &s;o high, as to leave hardly any wai&s;t. This encroachment of the petti|coats upon the wai&s;t, with the amazing number they wear, gives a &s;ize and importance to the lower and hind part of the body, to which it is by no means entitled; and very much deforms the appear|ance of the whole power. The elegant figure of the <HI>Venus de Medicis,</HI> or of the D&mdash;s of D&mdash;re, would he impaired or annihilated under &s;uch a pre|po&s;terous load of dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon an in&s;ulated ride, between the lakes of Neu|chatel and Morat, are many delightful points of view. Of the&s;e various pro&s;pects, the mo&s;t remark|able is from the &s;ummit of Mount Vicilly. What renders this charming &s;pot more particularly &s;trik|ing is, that it is perhaps the only central point, from which the eye can at once comprehend the va&s;t am|phitheatre, formed on one &s;ide by the Jura, &s;tretch|ing from the environs of Geneva as far as Ba&s;le, and on the other, by that &s;tupendous chain of &s;nowy Alps, which extends from the frontiers of Italy, to the con|&s;ines of Germany, and is lo&s;t at each extremity on the boundle&s;s horizon.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of Lau&s;anne, and its Vicinage.</HEAD>
<P>LAUSANNE is built upon an a&s;cent &s;o &s;teep, that in &s;ome places it is with great difficulty the hor&s;es can draw up a carriage; and foot pa&s;&s;engers mount towards the upper part of the town by flights of &s;teps which lean again&s;t the rocks. But the&s;e inconveniences are amply compen&s;ated by the &s;ub|lime&s;t views in nature; the principal object is the lake of Geneva, &s;haped like a bow; the <HI>arc</HI> of which is formed by the Pays de Vaud, and the <HI>cord</HI> by the coa&s;t of Chablais. From Geneva to Villeneuve, &s;ays <HI>Coxe,</HI> the two extremities of this lake, may be about 40 miles di&s;tant; it varies in its breadth, the narrowe&s;t part is &s;carce three miles acro&s;s, and from Rolles to Thonon, is 15. The town contains about 7000 inhabitants. It formerly belonged to the Duke of Savoy, and was the capital of the Pays de Vaud. However mortifying this may be to the for|mer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, it has certainly, &s;ays <HI>Moore,</HI> been a happy di&s;pen&s;ation to the inhabitants, who are in every re&s;pect more at their ea&s;e, and in a better &s;itu|ation, than any of the &s;ubjects of his Sardinian Ma|je&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="372">This city is &s;ituated within half a mile of the lake, and at the di&s;tance of about 30 miles from Geneva. As the nobility from the country, and from &s;ome parts of Switzerland, and the families of &s;everal officers who have retired from &s;ervice, re&s;ide here; there is an air of more ea&s;e and gaiety, and perhaps al&s;o &s;o much more real politene&s;s in the &s;ocieties of Lau&s;anne, than in tho&s;e of Geneva; at lea&s;t, this is firmly believed and a&s;&s;erted by all the nobles of this place, who con&s;ider them&s;elves as greatly &s;uperior to the citizens of Geneva. The&s;e, on the other hand, talk a good deal of the poverty, frivolou&s;ne&s;s, and ignorance of the&s;e &s;ame nobility, and make no &s;cruple of ranking their own enligh|tened mechanics above them in every e&s;&s;ential qua|lity.</P>
<P>Lau&s;anne po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an academy for the &s;tudents of this country; profe&s;&s;ors in every &s;cience are ap|pointed by government; and there is a tolerable li|brary for the u&s;e of the public.</P>
<P>The church of Lau&s;anne, formerly the cathedral, is a magnificent gothic building, &s;tanding on the mo&s;t elevated part of the town. It contains, among many other &s;epulchres, the tomb of <HI>Amadeus,</HI> the eighth Duke of Savoy, &s;tyled the <HI>Solomon</HI> of his age; but more known by the name of the Anti-pope, <HI>Felix</HI>
<PB N="331" REF="373">
the Fifth, who exhibited a &s;ingular in&s;tance in the annals of Europe, of a per&s;onage <HI>twice</HI> abdicating the pomp of &s;overeignty, and <HI>twice</HI> retiring to a pri|vate &s;tation.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed his early youth and ripening man|hood, in the pur&s;uit of ambition, he enlarged his dominions by the acqui&s;ition of the Genevois and Piedmont, and obtained an increa&s;e of rank by the erection of Savoy into a duchy. Yet in the mid&s;t of his greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, and when fortune &s;eemed mo&s;t propitious to him, the &s;udden death of a be|loved wife, and a narrow e&s;cape from a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, in&s;pired him with &s;uch a di&s;gu&s;t of the world, that he re&s;igned in 1434, the admini&s;tration of his e&s;tates to his elde&s;t &s;on, and accompanied with a few lords of his court, retired to a palace at La Ripaille, on the borders of the lake of Geneva. In this palace, which he called a hermitage, he enjoyed, with an ap|parent indifference to the affairs of the world, a calm and tranquillity that &s;eemed incompatible with his former a&s;piring ambition; until he was &s;uddenly cal|led forth to public notice, in a more exalted &s;ta|tion.</P>
<P>The council of Ba&s;le, having depo&s;ed <HI>Eugenius</HI> the Fourth, induced, according to &s;ome authors, by
<PB N="332" REF="374">
the reputation which <HI>Amadeus</HI> had acquired of &s;anc|tity, influenced according to others by his pre&s;ents and intrigues, rai&s;ed the hermit of La Ripaille to the papal throne. This event took place in 1439, the new pontiff quitting his favourite retreat, ac|cepted the proffered dignity, either with a real or af|fected reluctance, and a&s;&s;umed the name of <HI>Felix</HI> the Fifth.</P>
<P>The aera of his di&s;puted pontificate, was marked with turbulence and anarchy. In order to avoid the &s;torm which agitated Europe, and to favour the na|tural indolence of his temper, he frequently re|treated to his beloved hermitage, and directed the affairs of the church from that &s;eque&s;tered corner. Con&s;cious, at length, that his acceptance of the pa|pacy, &s;erved to widen, in&s;tead of healing the &s;chi&s;m of the church; finding that he was oppo&s;ed by the mo&s;t powerful princes of Europe; that, on the death of his rival <HI>Eugenius,</HI> the cardinals of Rome had cho&s;en another Pope; and being ill &s;upported by the remains of the council of Ba&s;le, he termi|nated the &s;chi&s;m, by re&s;igning the papal tiara in fa|vour of <HI>Nicholas</HI> the Fifth. In this tran&s;action, he proved his talents for negociation, by obtaining the following conditions: that he &s;hould enjoy the next rank to the pope; that he &s;hould be appointed vicar of the Roman &s;ee, and that all the acts pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="333" REF="375">
in his pontificate, &s;hould be valid. On his re&s;ig|nation, he fixed his re&s;idence at La Ripaille, and died in 1451.</P>
<P>Lau&s;anne, &s;ays <HI>Key&s;ler,</HI> lies in a valley, but &s;o uneven, that the carriage wheels mu&s;t be continu|ally &s;hod. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the town, is a very &s;pacious walk, with a wall, and a pro&s;pect towards the city and lake of Geneva, which &s;eems very near, but is a good half league di&s;tant.</P>
<P>In the wall of the great church, was a crack, wide enough for a man to creep through, occa&s;ioned by an earthquake in the year 1634. The celebrated old profe&s;&s;or <HI>Pictat,</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ay, that when he was a boy, and at play in the church-yard, he has &s;ometimes laid his cloak in it; about 60 years ago, it was clo&s;ed again by another earthquake, and the crevice which remained, was filled up with mortar, being not above an inch in breadth. The tower does not want beauty, but having been twice burned, only half of it is now &s;tanding. A &s;maller tower be|longing to this church, was al&s;o &s;et on fire by light|ning, when they prudently beat it down with a chain ball, by which the body of the church was &s;aved, and &s;ince a &s;pire has been rai&s;ed on it. On one &s;ide of this cathedral, is a walled terrace, like that at Berne, with this difference; that the terrace of Berne

is much higher walled, and that of Lau&s;anne, has the advantage in pro&s;pect, commanding the lake and all the country below towards Geneva. This country, indeed, from its nature and the im|provements of it, affords a delicious view, in the variety of little hills and dales, fields, meadows, vine|yards, and woods, together with the vicinity of the lake. All the&s;e allurements, and the regularity and mildne&s;s of the government, draw people of all countries into the Pays de Vaud, and e&s;pecially to pa&s;s the &s;ummers and autumns there. Some al&s;o purcha&s;e lands.</P>
<P>The re&s;ort of per&s;ons of rank from Geneva, and the canton of Berne, of men of letters, of gentle|men who have travelled, of experienced merchants, and other per&s;ons of amiable qualities, who came hither as a refuge from civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyran|ny, affords the mo&s;t de&s;irable opportunities of &s;pend|ing the time agreeably in improving conver&s;ation. Even mini&s;ters of &s;tate, who&s;e talents have &s;hone in the greate&s;t courts of Europe, have cho&s;en this &s;pot for the &s;eat of their repo&s;e: and their conver&s;ation, to a mind formed for in&s;truction whom they are plea&s;ed to honour with their confidence, cannot but be an exqui&s;ite entertainment; as they them&s;elves may feel tran&s;ports of rational plea&s;ures which they were

&s;trangers to, amid&s;t the tumult of a court, and the em|barra&s;&s;ments of their &s;tation.</P>
<P>The country from Lau&s;anne to Geneva abounds in vineyards; but the wine of a &s;trip of land, half a league on this &s;ide Nyon, is e&s;teemed the choice&s;t. This territory is three &s;mall leagues in length, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of La C&ocirc;te. The wine of the growth of Rolle and Bur&s;in, two particular &s;pots here, is reckoned to &s;urpa&s;s the re&s;t, and e&s;pecially the white wine; as the baronry of Capet, which lies nearer towards Geneva, is celebrated for red wine.</P>
<P>The wine growing on the Savoy &s;ide of the lake of Geneva, had formerly a very con&s;iderable vent, the people of Geneva, and the adjoining Swi&s;s, buy|ing their wine from Savoy; but a certain rapacious mini&s;ter put the Duke on laying a duty upon this wine, which as the Swi&s;s could not do without, he &s;aid would be a very great increa&s;e to the revenue. Such coun&s;ellors are but too readily li&s;tened to, and the impo&s;ition accordingly took place. This, of cour&s;e, occa&s;ioned the wine to ri&s;e, and the Swi&s;s were not wanting to make remon&s;trances, but all to no purpo&s;e; at la&s;t, &s;eeing no remedy, it occurred to &s;ome of the leading men, that though their an|ce&s;tors had never turned their thoughts to the plant|ing
<PB N="336" REF="378">
of vines, yet it was not impo&s;&s;ible, but their country, e&s;pecially that part of it between Geneva and Lau&s;anne, might yield as good wine as Savoy; the po&s;ition of their mountains, and of the land in general, affording a better expo&s;ure to the &s;un, than the Savoy territory. This bu&s;ine&s;s was immediately &s;et on foot, and the con&s;equence far exceeded all ex|pectation: by this means, the Savoy wines remained upon their hands, and in&s;tead of the uncertain ad|vantages the Duke's finances were gaping for, they lo&s;t, be&s;ides the detriment occa&s;ioned to his indu&s;|trious &s;ubjects, a certain income, which they have never &s;ince been able to retrieve.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, Lau&s;anne is governed by its own ma|gi&s;trates; has its own courts of ju&s;tice; and what is very &s;ingular, the citizens who po&s;&s;e&s;s hou&s;es in the principal &s;treets, enjoy the privilege of pronounc|ing &s;entence in criminal cau&s;es. The criminal is tried by the civil power: if he is found, or ac|knowledges him&s;elf guilty, the burghers of this &s;treet a&s;&s;emble; one of the magi&s;trates pleads in de|fence of the pri&s;oner, and another again&s;t him; the court of ju&s;tice give their opinion upon the point of law; and the majority of the citizens po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing hou&s;es in the principal &s;treet, determine the penalty. If the puni&s;hment is capital, there is, according to the letter of the law, no pardon, except it be ob|tained
<PB N="337" REF="379">
within 24 hours from the &s;overeign council of Berne; although it generally happens, that eight days are granted for that purpo&s;e. When the cri|minal is &s;eized within the juri&s;diction of the town, the fact is tried, and the burghers pronounce &s;en|tence in the town-hall; from this &s;entence there is no appeal. But if taken within the di&s;trict of the bailiff, he is tried in his hou&s;e, and an appeal lies to the council of Berne.</P>
<P>Vevay is another pretty little town in this di&s;trict, vi&s;ited by mo&s;t travellers. It is &s;weetly &s;ituated on a plain, near the head of the lake of Geneva, where the Rhine enters. The road from Lau&s;anne to this place, runs along the &s;ides of the mountains, between continued ranges of vineyards. The indu&s;try of the Swi&s;s is no where more ob&s;ervable, than in the&s;e parts; the mountains in many places, though natu|rally con&s;i&s;ting of a bare &s;teep rock, being thickly co|vered with vines. The mould has been brought from other grounds, in order to create a &s;oil, and is &s;upported by rows of &s;tones, ranged in &s;trait lines like walls.</P>
<P>This town is di&s;tingui&s;hed as being the re&s;idence of <HI>Edmund Ludlow,</HI> the famous parliamentary gene|ral, who&s;e name &s;tands foremo&s;t among the few per|&s;ons, who in tho&s;e times of mi&s;rule and confu&s;ion,
<PB N="338" REF="380">
uniformly acted with con&s;i&s;tency and dignity. True to his republican principles, he no le&s;s vio|lently oppo&s;ed the daring u&s;urpation of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> than the arbitrary mea&s;ures of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t; and could never be prevailed upon, either by threats or promi&s;es, to de&s;ert the cau&s;e, which he con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice and liberty.</P>
<P>Being excepted as one of the king's judges, from the act of indemnity, pa&s;&s;ed at the re&s;toration of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, he wandered, without any fixed place of re&s;idence; until he found an a&s;ylum from the bare attempts of his enemies at Vevay, under the protection of Berne.</P>
<P>At the important period of the revolution, he re|turned to England, anxious to &s;erve his country under our great deliverer; and <HI>William</HI> the Third, who&s;e mind ro&s;e &s;uperior to the narrow prejudices of party, was no le&s;s de&s;irous to employ a general of &s;uch approved experience and fidelity. But the king being addre&s;&s;ed by the Hou&s;e of Commons, to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation for apprehending <HI>Ludlow,</HI> at the moment his Maje&s;ty was going to employ him; he was accordingly compelled to quit England at this critical period, and again &s;ettled at Vevay. We may collect from his general character and conduct, that if he had been permitted to &s;erve his country,
<PB N="339" REF="381">
he would have &s;ucce&s;sfully employed his great mili|tary talents, again&s;t the a&s;&s;ertors of bigotry and de&s;|poti&s;m; and with the &s;ame zeal which he had di&s;|played in oppo&s;ing an arbitrary government, would have &s;upported the new admini&s;tration; when the enormous prerogatives of the crown, again&s;t which he had un&s;heathed his &s;word, were aboli&s;hed by law, and the freedom of the &s;ubject was e&s;tabli&s;hed on the ba&s;is of equal liberty, under the authority of a li|mited monarch.</P>
<P>He died in 1693, in the 64th year of his age; and was interred in the church of Vevay. His monu|ment is a plain grave-&s;tone of black marble, con|taining a Latin in&s;cription, which is printed in <HI>Addi&s;on's</HI> Travels. The hou&s;e which he formerly inhabited, &s;tands near the gate, leading to the Vallais, and the following motto is in&s;cribed over the door, which is &s;till pre&s;erved out of re&s;pect to his me|mory; <HI>Omne &s;olum forti patria e&s;t.</HI> i. e. To a brave man, every country is his own?</P>
<P>Not far from Vevay, is the village of Clarens, rendered memorable by <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau,</HI> from having been cho&s;en by him as the &s;cene of his celebrated novel Eloi&s;e. It &s;tands on an eminence, who&s;e gen|tle declivity &s;lopes gradually towards the lake. The adjacent &s;cenery con&s;i&s;ts of vineyards, fields of corn,
<PB N="240" REF="382">
pa&s;ture, rich groves of oak, a&s;h, and &s;pani&s;h che&s;nut trees. Although the &s;ituation and environs harmo|nize with the animated &s;cenery in this novel, yet the ca&s;tle by no means accords with the de&s;cription given of it in this work. The traveller &s;ees an oblong building with ancient towers, and a pent-hou&s;e roof; in the in&s;ide, a large hall that looks like a pri&s;on; and the whole bears rather the antiquated appear|ance of a feudal man&s;ion, inhabited by &s;ome turbu|lent baron, then the re&s;idence of the elegant and im|pa&s;&s;ioned Julie.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to Clarens, on the other &s;hore of the lake, are the dark gloomy rocks of Meillerie. Al|though there are no traces of any hi&s;tory like that of Julie in the&s;e parts, yet the &s;cenery is &s;trongly marked; and every &s;pot which is mentioned in the&s;e letters, actually exi&s;ts in this romantic country. <HI>Rou&s;&s;eau</HI> him&s;elf, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at different parts on the borders of the lake, and particularly at Meil|lerie, about that period of his life, when he may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have written his Eloi&s;e.</P>
