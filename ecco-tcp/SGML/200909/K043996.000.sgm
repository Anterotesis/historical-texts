<HEAD>TO THE Right Honourable the LORD MAYOR, THE Wor&s;hipful the ALDERMEN, AND THE COMMON-COUNCIL of the City of London.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD, AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE the Legi&s;lature had entirely a&s;&s;ented to the late Bill in favour of the Encroachments near Durham-Yard, the two following little Tracts, were drawn up with a view to prevent the Confirmation of that Inju&s;tice; but as they were not fini&s;hed time enough to be Communica|ted, with any hope of Succe&s;s, to tho&s;e Per|&s;ons
<PB N="iv" REF="3">for who&s;e peru&s;al they were at fir&s;t in|tended, I think it my Duty, in the next Place, to addre&s;s them to you, as they parti|cularly relate to the Rights and Property of the City of London.&mdash;When <HI>Property</HI> is taken away from the Ancient and Legal <HI>Proprie|tors</HI> WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT, and ve&s;ted in other Per&s;ons, <HI>even private individuals,</HI> as their <HI>own Property,</HI> for their <HI>own private</HI> ad|vantage, by Parliamentary Authority, &s;uch a Precedent will render the <HI>Property</HI> of all Men as precarious as their <HI>Party intere&s;t,</HI> and will enlarge the dangerous Sy&s;tem of Pub|lic Corruption, by increa&s;ing the means of its baneful influence.&mdash;But this is not mere|ly, a Political evil; it is al&s;o <HI>immoral and ir|religious,</HI> in every point of view. To remove the Ancient Land Mark, or Boundary, is an <HI>accur&s;ed Crime</HI> according to the Laws of God; (compare Deut. xix. 14. xxvii. 17. Job xxiv. 2. Proverbs xxii. 28.) &s;o that <HI>every kind of wilful Encroachment</HI> upon <HI>the Property</HI> of others, is, in &s;ome degree, tainted with this heinous Guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">Times are bad enough, when &s;uch inva|&s;ions on Public or Private Property <HI>remain unpuni&s;hed;</HI> but the <HI>moral State</HI> of any Nation is even deplorable, and their mea&s;ure of ini|quity may be &s;aid to be almo&s;t filled up, when &s;uch notorious Acts of Inju&s;tice meet with <HI>Public Encouragement,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>repre|hen&s;ion;</HI> and when Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers are <HI>rewarded</HI> and <HI>gratified</HI> (to the Exclu&s;ion of the in|jured Proprietor) with a <HI>Parliamentary Right</HI> even in the very Object, which tempted them to break the Laws and <HI>wrong</HI> their Neigh|bours.</P>
<P>Many well meaning People do not &s;eem to be aware of the bad tendency of this exam|ple; and there is, therefore, the more nece&s;|&s;ity that it &s;hould be pointed out and ex|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>The inju&s;tice appeared to me &s;o notori|ous, after I had carefully con&s;idered the ca&s;e, that I &s;hould have been <HI>inclined,</HI> as <HI>a Citizen of the World,</HI> to repre&s;ent the mon|&s;trous <HI>immorality</HI> of <HI>rewarding,</HI> in&s;tead <HI>of Pu|ni&s;hing, Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers,</HI> (le&s;t the evil example
<PB N="vi" REF="5">&s;hould become epidemical and contagious in <HI>the World,</HI> which is already too corrupt) but <HI>as a Citizen of London</HI> it is even <HI>my Duty</HI> to do &s;o in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e: for when I took the Oath of Allegiance to the King, I was Sworn at the &s;ame time to <Q><HI>maintain the Franchi&s;es and Cu&s;toms,</HI></Q> of the City of London to the utmo&s;t of my power (&s;ee the Oath of every Freeman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>You &s;hall &s;wear, that ye &s;hall be good and true to our Sovereign Lord King George, obey&s;ant and obedient ye &s;hall be to the Mayor and Mini&s;ters of this City. <HI>The Franchi&s;es and Cu&s;toms thereof ye &s;hall maintain, and this City keep harmle&s;s in that that in you is, &amp;c.</HI></Q></NOTE>) and therefore, as I hope I &s;hall ever be faithful to the City of London, as well as true to our mo&s;t gra|cious Sovereign, I e&s;teem it my indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty <HI>to both,</HI> for the &s;ake of <HI>public Ju&s;tice,</HI> to point out the <HI>illegality</HI> (as it appears to me) and dangerous tendency of <HI>Publicly reward|ing the Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers on the Rights of this Great City</HI> with an <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> Title to the very object of their temptation to Tre&s;pa&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">The <HI>manner</HI> of making the&s;e Encroach|ments (viz. by throwing Rubbi&s;h into the Water without any Fence to retain it) has been as hurtful to the River as the En|croachments them&s;elves, without affording the lea&s;t probability of any one good effect, &s;aving, or convenience what&s;oever, to recommend it: <HI>a method</HI> unfavourable to every purpo&s;e, except the clande&s;tine De&s;igns of Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers, that the intended Pro|jection of their Encroachments may not &s;ur|prize and alarm the Public before the Mi&s;|chief is carried into Execution: as for in|&s;tance;&mdash;if the &s;pace, which has lately been, thus gradually, &s;tolen from the River near Durham Yard, had been previou&s;ly marked off with Piles for the Boundaries of a Wharf, or with a Bank of large Chalk-Stones, or other hard Materials, not liable to be wa&s;hed away, (as all Embankments on Navigable Rivers ought to be made) the Tre&s;pa&s;s would have appeared much more enormous at fir&s;t than by this method, which rendered the
<PB N="viii" REF="7">Progre&s;s of the growing Encroachments le&s;s notorious and alarming.</P>
<P>Since the&s;e late Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es began, the Bed of the River (as I have been informed by &s;everal Watermen and others, who have been well acquainted with the River for many Years) is con&s;iderably increa&s;ed in Height, which is certainly occa&s;ioned, in great mea&s;ure, by the <HI>manner of Embanking</HI> above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>But, I am &s;orry, my Lord and Gentlemen, to ob&s;erve, that the City is as much to blame on this Account as the Encroachers; for my fellow Citizens, or &s;ome of them, have &s;uf|fered them&s;elves to be per&s;uaded, that this is the mo&s;t eligible way of Embanking; and they have, therefore, <HI>adopted,</HI> or, at lea&s;t, <HI>do al|low</HI> the practice of this pernicious and <HI>&s;lovenly</HI> Method, in tho&s;e Parts, where the Embank|ment is authorized; &s;o that the City &s;eems to betray her own Cau&s;e, as if &s;he really intend|ed, by &s;etting this <HI>bad Example,</HI> to ju&s;tify the like notorious Abu&s;e near Durham-Yard; and, thereby, render the Progre&s;s and Iniquity of that growing Encroachment le&s;s con&s;picu|ous
<PB N="ix" REF="8">and remarkable. It behoves the City to enquire how &s;uch an incon&s;i&s;tency began: for this <HI>rude, &s;lovenly</HI> and <HI>unmechanical Mea&s;ure</HI> could not have been adopted for the &s;ake of &s;aving <HI>either Time or Expence</HI> in the Work; becau&s;e it, certainly, requires a much greater Quantity of Rubbi&s;h than would have been really nece&s;&s;ary to fill up the Space intended to be embanked! And this to the manife&s;t Detriment of the River! for the lighter Particles of the Rubbi&s;h are con&s;tantly wa&s;hed away from the Banks, every Tide, both up and down the Stream; and mu&s;t inevitably lodge at the Bottom of the River; becau&s;e the Current runs, alternately, both Ways. And, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, the boa&s;ted Scheme of <HI>contracting the Avenue of the River</HI> will not (it is manife&s;t) prevent the gradual filling up of the Bed, becau&s;e the Rubbi&s;h and Filth, that is wa&s;hed away from the Banks at one Time of Tide, is liable to be brought back again at another; and &s;o to be &s;hifted, backwards and forwards, till the whole is gradually incorporated in a thick
<PB N="x" REF="9">heavy Loam at the Bottom of the River; which, at length, becomes too firm to be af|fected or removed by the Current; and by this means the Bed will, probably, be &s;o rai&s;ed, in proce&s;s of time, as to render the River to|tally unfit for Navigation.</P>
<P>It is therefore, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary (my Lord and Gentlemen) to put a Stop, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to this &s;candalous Practice (viz. of throwing Rubbi&s;h into the River without a Fence to retain it) whether the Embank|ments are allowed to Proceed or not: but it is, certainly, more for the Intere&s;t of the City to <HI>cut new Docks</HI> and <HI>Rece&s;&s;es</HI> from the River, and <HI>to clear</HI> and <HI>deepen</HI> the old ones, than to <HI>Embank.</HI></P>
<P>There are likewi&s;e &s;ome other Abu&s;es to which the alarming Increa&s;e of the River's Bed is, likewi&s;e, in &s;ome Degree, to be attri|buted: for be&s;ides many other le&s;&s;er En|croachments that are continually making on both Sides the River, by enlarging the Banks with Rubbi&s;h, driving Piles, &amp;c. I am in|formed, that Rubbi&s;h from Buildings, Re|fu&s;e
<PB N="xi" REF="10">from the Dye-hou&s;es, &amp;c. have &s;ome|times been thrown out of Lighters into the River in the Night, in order to &s;ave the trouble and expence of carrying the load farther away.&mdash;I have been told this by &s;e|veral per&s;ons who have accidentally &s;een the like Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.&mdash;It is therefore become ne|ce&s;&s;ary, for the future Pre&s;ervation of this Noble River, that the City &s;hould offer a proper Reward to all Watermen and others, that &s;hall give the fir&s;t Information at Guild|hall, or the Man&s;ion-Hou&s;e, of any &s;uch En|croachments or Mi&s;demeanors in future. The Reward &s;hould be paid when the Offender is convicted; and might, perhaps, be defrayed out of the Fine for the Offence. And the Water-Bailiffs &s;hould, likewi&s;e, be rewarded in the &s;ame manner, whenever they &s;hall have been vigilant enough to give the fir&s;t Notice of any Mi&s;demeanor. A proper Inque&s;t of Citizens &s;hould be appointed out of each Ward by Rotation, or, el&s;e, be impanneled by the Sheriffs as a Jury (from time to time as there &s;hould be occa&s;ion) to examine the
<PB N="xii" REF="11">Complaints, as &s;oon as any Informations are received. And the A&s;&s;ent or Leave of &s;uch an Inque&s;t to any Encroachment, driving of Piles, &amp;c. &s;hould not be allowed to autho|rize the &s;ame, or put a &s;top to further En|quiry, le&s;t they &s;hould be in any Degree in|fluenced by private Solicitation, or be other|wi&s;e tampered with; (which has &s;ometimes been the Ca&s;e on public Inquiries when Nui&s;ances have been pre&s;ented) but the final Determination &s;hould re&s;t, as at pre&s;ent, with the Court of Common Council; and no Water-Bailiff, or other City Officer what|ever, &s;hould have Power to excu&s;e, or tolerate, the driving any Piles, or the lea&s;t En|croachment. For when &s;uch a Power is ve&s;ted in any <HI>Officer,</HI> who&s;e charge is of this nature, it is apt to de&s;troy the intended utility of his <HI>Office;</HI> becau&s;e the more Offences and Encroachments are committed, the more Fees and Chri&s;tmas Compliments he will, probably, receive, and annually demand, as the Price of Toleration and Forbearance. The Office of Water Bailiff (though it affords an ample
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">Proof of the ancient Juri&s;diction and Right of the City of London to the River Thames, yet) has been hitherto, in general, (I fear,) rather a means of authorizing Encroach|ments, than of preventing them.</P>
<P>I do not mean to blame the Conduct of your Water Bailiff, or of any other Officer in particular; for Cu&s;tom has &s;o reconciled the giving of pecuniary Acknowledgments to the Water Bailiff for tolerating Encroach|ments (as I have been informed), that the &s;ame are looked upon as the <HI>lawful</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t Dues</HI> of his Office: and he does not clan|de&s;tinely demand them, but openly, and, as it were, by the authority of the City; which receives of every &s;uch Officer, at his appoint|ment, a very large &s;um of Money, for the Purcha&s;e of his Office, <HI>in Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Emoluments.</HI>&mdash;I &s;ay &mdash; <Q><HI>in Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Emoluments,</HI></Q> becau&s;e the &s;ame mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily <HI>be &s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to be known and under|&s;tood by <HI>the Sellers</HI> as well as <HI>the Buyers,</HI> at the Time of the Purcha&s;e, if the <HI>proper</HI> In|come and Value of the Office be compared

<PB N="xiii" REF="14">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">with the enormous Price that has, of late, been given for it. The <HI>Profits</HI> or <HI>Salary</HI> ought, therefore, to be made adequate in &s;ome other way, otherwi&s;e <HI>the City</HI> and not <HI>the Water-Bailiff</HI> mu&s;t be blamed.</P>
<P>I ought not, however, to blame <HI>the City</HI> without endeavouring, at the &s;ame time, to obviate the Objection which &s;ome Per|&s;ons have lately urged again&s;t her on the &s;ame Account, viz. <Q>that by neg|lecting to prevent Abu&s;es and Encroach|ments, &s;he has forfeited her <HI>Right</HI> of Con&s;ervancy:</Q> but as I have already &s;hewn, in the two little Tracts, &s;ent herewith, that the City has <HI>a natural,</HI> as well as <HI>Legal Right</HI> to her Juri&s;diction on the River, I need only add, further, that <HI>the like Plea</HI> of Forfeiture, if it were once admitted, would be equally effectual to deprive any Lord or Gentleman of his <HI>Family E&s;tate and Patri|mony;</HI> for there are but few Men, I fear who make &s;o good a U&s;e of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions as they might, and ought; though there are very many, that would PRETEND <HI>to improve
<PB N="xv" REF="16">and di&s;po&s;e of the &s;ame more advantageou&s;ly for the</HI> PUBLIC GOOD, if <HI>&s;uch a Plea</HI> was &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify an Attempt <HI>to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the right Owner.</HI> But to return&mdash;I do not mean to blame the City <HI>for &s;elling</HI> the Office of Water Bailiff; but, rather, for not publi&s;hing (before it is offered to &s;ale) proper Conditions, In&s;truc|tions, and Injunctions, to point out the Duties of the Office; and for not giving notice that the &s;ame is liable to the Penalty of Forfeiture for Mal-admini&s;tration; in order that the Pur|cha&s;er may, thereby, be enabled to regulate his Conduct agreeable to the <HI>real Duty</HI> of his Office; and may know, that he forfeits his Place, if he, wilfully, tolerates <HI>the lea&s;t En|croachment.</HI> Were this Method ob&s;erved, <HI>the &s;elling</HI> of Places (I mean Places <HI>merely of Tru&s;t,</HI> that don't require great Learning and Science) would be, by far, the mo&s;t eligi|ble way of di&s;po&s;al; becau&s;e Recommenda|tions and great Intere&s;t are far from being <HI>certain Proofs</HI> of the mo&s;t de&s;erving Candi|date; whereas the Purcha&s;e Money would be a <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>real Gain,</HI> as well as an
<PB N="xvi" REF="17">excellent <HI>Security</HI> for good Behaviour. But without &s;uch In&s;tructions and Conditions the <HI>private Emolument</HI> of the <HI>Officer</HI> is too liable to interfere with the <HI>public Utility</HI> of the <HI>Office:</HI> whereas, by the Method which I have already &s;ubmitted to your Con&s;ideration <HI>(viz. of offer|ing Rewards for the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of Offen|ces,)</HI> every Waterman would find it his In|tere&s;t to take upon him&s;elf the Office of a <HI>diligent</HI> and <HI>inexorable Water-Bailiff,</HI> becau&s;e the propo&s;ed Reward ari&s;es from the <HI>public Proof,</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>Concealment</HI> and <HI>Tolera|tion</HI> of Offences; and there would be too many of the&s;e <HI>voluntary Officers</HI> to be bribed to &s;ecrecy.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<PB N="3" REF="19">
<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> Some Remarks on the Ca&s;e of the City of London with re&s;pect to the Encroach|ments on the River Thames near Durham-Yard, and the Bill now depending in Parliament <HI>to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;aid Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT cannot be denied, notwith&s;tanding all the delu&s;ive Sophi&s;try that hath been u&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion, that the City of London hath ever enjoyed and exerci&s;ed on the River Thames a Right of <HI>Con&s;ervancy,</HI> as well of the <HI>Width</HI> or <HI>Avenue,</HI> (by occa&s;ionally in&s;pecting and regulating the Boundaries) <HI>as of the
<PB N="4" REF="20">Fi&s;hery,</HI> with power and authority to remove all nui&s;ances; &s;o that this Franchi&s;e, or Liberty, is ab&s;olutely ve&s;ted in the City by <HI>Pre&s;cription and Ancient U&s;age,</HI> be&s;ides many po&s;itive <HI>Grants and Confirmations;</HI>&mdash;And what Freeholder will be able to produce a more authentic Title to his E&s;tate and Property! For a long proce&s;s of time, and a long U&s;e, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or Cu&s;tom, which exceeds the Memory of Man, <HI>is &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a Right,</HI> or ju&s;t Title. <Q>Longum Tempus et longus U&s;us, qui excedit memoriam homi|num, <HI>&s;ufficit pro jure.</HI></Q> Principia Legis et AEquitatis, p. 55. See al&s;o Co. Lit. 115. There is, be&s;ides, an expre&s;s Article in Magna Charta to &s;ecure to the City of London <HI>all her Ancient Liberties and Cu&s;toms</HI> (<Q>Civitas Londini habeat omnes libertates &s;uas antiquas et
<PB N="5" REF="21">con&s;uetudines &s;uas.</Q> (Cap. 9.) a|mong&s;t which, undoubtedly, this Right and Cu&s;tom of <HI>Con&s;ervancy</HI> is to be reckoned as one of the <HI>mo&s;t material Franchi&s;es,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>very exi&s;tence</HI> of this great Trading City depends upon it; &s;o that the City's Title to the Con|&s;ervancy is founded on <HI>a natural</HI> as well as <HI>legal Right.</HI></P>
<P>The pretended con&s;ent of the Col|legiate Church of We&s;tmin&s;ter cannot palliate the Tre&s;pa&s;s, or le&s;&s;en the in|jury to the City of London. The Grant of King James, on which the Claim of that Church is &s;aid to be founded, could not convey <HI>a power to embank and fill up the River,</HI> nor a Right <HI>to confirm &s;uch a Tre&s;pa&s;s</HI> when committed, becau&s;e the King him&s;elf had <HI>no &s;uch power,</HI> and con&s;equently
<PB N="6" REF="22">had <HI>no right to Grant it;</HI> &s;o that the Juri&s;diction &s;aid to extend <Q><HI>infra finem aquoe to the middle of the Stream,</HI></Q> mu&s;t be con&s;trued in &s;ome other &s;en&s;e, or it will, otherwi&s;e, render the <HI>whole Grant null and void;</HI> becau&s;e the River Thames is <HI>a Public Avenue or Pa&s;&s;age</HI> to the City; &s;o that, in this re&s;pect, it is to be con&s;idered as the <HI>King's high|way, and it</HI> is e&s;teemed the King's high|way no otherwi&s;e than in Tru&s;t for the Public: &s;o that the King has no power to di&s;pen&s;e with an <HI>Encroachment on the highway;</HI> for though <Q><HI>he may par|don Nu&s;ances that are tran&s;ient and not continuing,</HI></Q>&mdash;Yet <Q><HI>a Nu&s;ance in the highway, which &s;till continues, and is not ended, until removed; can|not be pardoned;</HI></Q> (Judge Vaughan's Reports, 333.) becau&s;e <HI>the &s;ame is to be e&s;teemed evil and iniquitous, in its very
<PB N="7" REF="23">nature, a "Malum in &s;e, Bad in it&s;elf,"</HI> which is further proved by the &s;ame Learned Author in P. 337. <Q>I may conclude (&s;ays he) tho&s;e things to be <HI>mala in &s;e, which can never be made lawful.</HI></Q> He then cites the Year-Book of 11 Henry 7. viz. <Q>But <HI>Malum in &s;e,</HI> the King nor any other can di&s;pen&s;e.</Q> And in&s;tanceth, <Q>Si come, Si le Roy, voyloit pardon de occider un homme, <HI>ou de faire nu&s;ance in le haut chemin, ceo e&s;t void,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To wit, if the King, &s;hould be willing to pardon the Killing of a Man, (or rather, as the next &s;entence explains it) <Q><HI>will</HI> GIVE POWER to <HI>kill a Man,</HI></Q> or to make <Q>a Nui&s;ance in the High-Road, the &s;ame is void.</Q></NOTE> &mdash;and upon the &s;ame rea&s;on (&s;ays he) a licen&s;e to impri&s;on a Man, <HI>to take his Land,</HI> his Hor&s;e, or any <HI>thing
<PB N="8" REF="24">that is his from him, is void.</HI> For in <HI>Life, Liberty, and E&s;tate,</HI> every Man, <HI>who hath not forfeited them,</HI> hath a Property and Right which the Law allows him to defend; and if it is violated, it gives an Action to re|dre&s;s the Wrong, and to Puni&s;h the <HI>Wrong-doer</HI>&mdash;Therefore a <HI>Di&s;pen|&s;ation,</HI> that is, to make lawful the taking from a Man any thing which he may lawfully defend from being taken, or lawfully puni&s;h if it be, <HI>mu&s;t be void.</HI> For it is a contradic|tion to make it <HI>lawful,</HI> to take what may be <HI>lawfully</HI> hindered from be|ing taken, <HI>or lawfully Puni&s;hed</HI> if it be. And that were to make <HI>two Men</HI> have &s;everal <HI>Plenary Rights in the &s;ame thing at the &s;ame time, which</HI> NO LAW CAN EFFECT: <HI>Therefore</HI> TO DO <HI>a thing which</HI> NO LAW <HI>can
<PB N="9" REF="25">make</HI> LAWFUL, <HI>mu&s;t be</HI>&mdash;MALUM IN SE.</Q></P>

<HEAD>REMARKS CONCERNING THE ENCROACHMENTS ON THE RIVER THAMES NEAR DURHAM-YARD. PART II.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB N="27" REF="42"><HI>PART II.</HI> Some further Remarks concerning the Injury done to the City of London by the Encroachments on the River Thames near Durham-Yard.</HEAD>
<P>THE extraordinary Favour &s;hewn in Parliament to the Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es lately committed by &s;everal Per&s;ons, in the enormous Encroachment on the River Thames near Durham-Yard, is liable to affect the Security of Property in general; becau&s;e an Encouragement to commit Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and a Precedent to e&s;tabli&s;h and confirm the &s;ame, when committed, do certainly tend to the
<PB N="28" REF="43">Total Subver&s;ion of Ju&s;tice; for in every point of view the &s;ame are repugnant to the fundamental Principles of Law and Equity.</P>
<P>Actions were commenced in the Court of King's Bench again&s;t the En|croachments, <HI>before</HI> the Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers brought their Bill into Parliament; &s;o that the Concurrence of Parliament with the Authors of the Injury, <HI>is a gro&s;s in&s;ult upon the Laws,</HI> by &s;topping the regular Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice in <HI>a mat|ter of Right,</HI> which came properly be|fore the King's Courts; for, as it is e&s;teemed unju&s;t to puni&s;h a Man by the force of an <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> Law, it, certainly, is equally unju&s;t by an <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> Law to confirm, and e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>manife&s;t Tre&s;pa&s;s,</HI> which was previ|ou&s;ly referred to a proper Court for
<PB N="29" REF="44">Redre&s;s; and the Application to Par|liament is of it&s;elf a &s;ufficient Proof, that the Right and Claim of the City of London <HI>are ju&s;t;</HI> and &s;uch as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have found <HI>a Remedy in Law,</HI> according to the u&s;ual Proceedings of the King's Courts, otherwi&s;e the <HI>ex po&s;t facto Law</HI> had been needle&s;s.</P>
<P>It ought to be remembered, al&s;o, that the City of London, for the &s;ake of Peace, and to avoid a Conte&s;t in Parliament, was <HI>inclined</HI> to allow &s;ome of the Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers, (who are eminent Builders) as much ground in the Front of their Buildings, as would be &s;uffi|cient to make a Wharf, wide enough for Carts to come down, and to turn, and load, &amp;c. as at other Quays in the City, &s;o that the u&s;e and intention of the noble underground Pa&s;&s;ages might
<PB N="30" REF="45">not be lo&s;t, or in the lea&s;t injured; and a private intimation of this Lenity and Favour, to which the City &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed, was given to a Friend of the Builders, that they might be advi&s;ed to Petition the City for Room to make &s;uch a Wharf; and they were told, that the &s;ame would <HI>probably</HI> be granted in con&s;ideration of their great Expences, and the Grandeur of their Buildings.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of <HI>&s;uch a Petition,</HI> the Builders pre&s;ented a <HI>Memorial</HI> (they did not deign to call it <HI>a Petition</HI>) de&s;iring more than 3 or 4 Times as much room as was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;aid purpo&s;e; becau&s;e, it &s;eems, a Wharf alone would not content them; but, <HI>as Builders,</HI> they mu&s;t be indulged al&s;o with room enough, out of the Width of the Ri|ver, to make (likewi&s;e for <HI>a Public
<PB N="31" REF="46">Ornament,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e) <HI>even a Timber Yard be&s;ides!</HI>&mdash;They did not, indeed, men|tion <HI>the Timber Yard</HI> in their Memorial, but the de&s;ign plainly appears by a Clau&s;e in the Bill to regulate <HI>the Height of the Piles of Timber,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>They did not fail, however, <HI>to demand</HI> of the City, as much Space as they thought nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>their intended Tim|ber Yard;</HI> and they were plea&s;ed at the &s;ame time to de&s;ire <HI>the Concurrence of the City (as Con&s;ervators of the River) to their Petition in Parliament!</HI> An In&s;ult this to the Citizens of London, <HI>as gro&s;s and enormous, as the Encroachment it&s;elf;</HI>&mdash;for, in effect, it was to de&s;ire the Citizens to join in a Petition to Parlia|ment <HI>again&s;t them&s;elves;</HI> that is, in Fa|vour of, and to e&s;tabli&s;h and confirm a notorious Tre&s;pa&s;s committed in De|fiance
<PB N="32" REF="47">of their own repeated Prohibi|tions and Pre&s;entments.</P>
<P>The Memorial, however, was rejected with a proper Di&s;dain. But this was no hindrance to the Adventurers; they were already <HI>&s;ufficiently aware,</HI> that they might affront the City with Impunity.&mdash;They knew their <HI>Party</HI> Intere&s;t in Parliament, and <HI>the Partiality</HI> has, hitherto, been <HI>proved by the Succe&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Two great Law Lords &s;trenuou&s;ly en|deavoured to palliate the Offence, and to &s;et forth the Public Utility of the Em|bankment: One of them admitted that, <Q>the pre&s;ent Scheme was intended for the private Emolument of Me&s;&s;. A|dams, but then, (&s;aid he) that Emolu|ment could only increa&s;e in Proportion to the Convenience, and Public Uti|lity
<PB N="33" REF="48">of the Embankment; if it was found inconvenient; the intended u&s;e would be lo&s;t; con&s;equently their Profit would go with it; it was, therefore, in every point, a great Public Good ari&s;ing from a Private Advantage.</Q> However plau&s;ible this Argument may &s;eem, yet I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, that it ill becomes any Gentle|man at the head of the Law, to view <HI>a Public Good</HI> through the medium <HI>of a Private Advantage,</HI> e&s;pecially as that <HI>private advantage</HI> had been &s;ought by <HI>a manife&s;t Public Injury and Tre&s;pa&s;s;</HI> for when the Encroachment fir&s;t be|gan, the Right of the City of London was &s;o far from being di&s;puted, that the Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers them&s;elves acknow|ledged it, by Petitioning for Leave; and though they could not obtain Leave from tho&s;e who had a Right to
<PB N="34" REF="49">give it, yet they continued to <HI>enlarge</HI> their enormous Tre&s;pa&s;s, as confident|ly as if the whole River was indi&s;pu|tably their own. But even if the ima|ginary <HI>Public Good,</HI> (&s;uppo&s;ed by the learned Chief Ju&s;tice) be admitted, yet his Lord&s;hip knows, that <Q>That which is otherwi&s;e Good and Ju&s;t in it&s;elf, becomes Wicked and Unju&s;t, if it is &s;ought or obtained by Force or Fraud. <HI>Quod alias bonum &amp; ju&s;tum e&s;t, &s;i per vim vel fraudem petatur, malum et inju&s;tum efficitur.</HI></Q> (3 C. 78.) and his Lord&s;hip will not (I appre|hend) deny, that <HI>an enormous Tre&s;pa&s;s</HI> has been committed; and therefore, tho&s;e that are robbed and injured ought, <HI>before all things, to be rein&s;tated,</HI> and have their Rights re&s;tored. <Q>Spo|liatus debet <HI>ante omnia re&s;titui.</HI></Q> 2 Iu&s;t. 714. Law, Ju&s;tice, and Equity,
<PB N="35" REF="50">cannot &s;hew the lea&s;t favour or con&s;i|deration for the Delinquents in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, becau&s;e <HI>"Iniquity Bars Equity,"</HI> &mdash;and, <Q>no Man can take advantage from his own Tre&s;pa&s;s or Injury. <HI>Nullus commodum capere pote&s;t de in|juria &s;ua propria.</HI></Q> Co.

<P>The &s;ame Doctrine may be extended even to the Building of <HI>whole Towns upon other Mens Ground, without Leave;</HI> becau&s;e the Towns would be for the ac|commodation of Gentlemen, of Trade&s;|men, of Manufacturers, Artificers, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> whereby <HI>the Public</HI> would manife&s;tly be benefited as well as <HI>the Builder, in proportion</HI> to the Succe&s;s of each Undertaking in the Increa&s;e of Inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="53">If the lawful Proprietor of the Ground, on which <HI>I tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed,</HI> would be plea&s;ed to give me his Con&s;ent, it would be well; and if he refu&s;ed it, <HI>my Preten&s;ions would &s;till be as good as the much favoured Cau&s;e of the Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers at Durham-Yord;</HI> for, even though I &s;hould be obliged to allow that my pre&s;ent Scheme <Q><HI>was intended for the Private Emolument</HI> of,</Q> my&s;elf&mdash;yet I could alledge the Opinion of a Chief Ju&s;tice, that <Q><HI>this Emolument could only increa&s;e in proportion to the Con|venience and Public Utility of,</HI></Q> my Inn, my Mill, or my Town, <Q><HI>If it was found inconvenient, the intended U&s;e would be lo&s;t, con&s;equently,</HI>" my <HI>Profit would go with it; it would therefore</HI></Q> (according to this Opinion of my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice) <Q><HI>be in
<PB N="39" REF="54">every point a great</HI> PUBLIC GOOD, <HI>ari|&s;ing from a</HI> PRIVATE ADVANTAGE.</Q></P>
<P>I might alledge, al&s;o, that this <HI>pri|vate Advantage</HI> of mine, ought to be much more favoured than that of the Encroachers on the River Thames, becau&s;e, if I &s;hould rai&s;e my Prices for Provi&s;ions, for Grinding, for Rent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon the Public, there would &s;till be Room &s;ufficient in the Neighbour|hood, (<HI>as the Con&s;ent of Proprietors</HI> is <HI>at pre&s;ent e&s;teemed unnece&s;&s;ary</HI>) for other People, al&s;o, to <HI>Tre&s;pa&s;s</HI> and Build more Inns, more Mills, or more Towns <HI>for</HI> THEIR OWN <HI>and the Public Advantage,</HI> as near to my advantageous Situation as they &s;hould think proper; &s;o that the Public, when <HI>impo&s;ed upon by me,</HI> might be enabled to give the pre|&s;erence to cheaper and le&s;s uncon|&s;cionable Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="55">But in the other Ca&s;e, the local Ad|vantages are more limited and confined to a particular Situation; and the <HI>En|croachments are already &s;o great,</HI> that there is &s;carcely Room for more within any advantageous Di&s;tance; be|cau&s;e the Advantage of Situation <HI>for Wharfs</HI> is confined within the extent of the Trading Part of the Town, now fully occupied; <HI>and the Port or Ba&s;on of the River,</HI> within the&s;e Bounds, is already too much contracted to admit of <HI>more Encroachments,</HI> without encum|bering or &s;topping up <HI>the Pa&s;&s;age of the River</HI> with Craft and Ve&s;&s;els, which even at pre&s;ent are greatly endangered for want of commodious and proper Mooring-Places out of the Stream and Tide-way.&mdash;During the Fro&s;ty Wea|ther this la&s;t Winter, 3 or 4 Ships were wrecked, and many others damaged,
<PB N="41" REF="56"><HI>even in the Port of London,</HI> for want of &s;uch proper Accommodations; and a very con&s;iderable number of Barges, Lighters, &amp;c. were forced away from their Moorings by the Ice, and lo&s;t, both above and below London Bridge; &s;o that it is manife&s;t, that <HI>Water-room</HI> is of much more con&s;equence to the Port of London than any Land gained from it can po&s;&s;ibly be; and that there cannot, therefore, be any Room to &s;pare, for making more Wharfs out of the Bed of the River, without <HI>an ap|parent Injury to the Harbour;</HI> &s;o that if the new Wharfs &s;hould become ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary by an Increa&s;e of Trade, <HI>the Public Utility</HI> mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the Exactions of the <HI>Private Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;or,</HI> who&s;e Tenure is founded in <HI>Pub|lic Injury and Inju&s;tice;</HI> and the Trade of this great City, on which its <HI>very
<PB N="42" REF="57">Exi&s;tence depends,</HI> mu&s;t be Loaded and Clogged with <HI>the much favoured Pri|vate Advantage</HI> of <HI>each Tre&s;pa&s;&s;er;</HI> &s;o that we may fairly mea&s;ure, by the Enormity of the pre&s;ent Encroach|ments, <HI>how con&s;cientiou&s;ly Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers in general</HI> would deign to con&s;ider the Trade and Rights of <HI>the Public,</HI> when their own <HI>Private Intere&s;t</HI> is in View.</P>
