<HEAD>ALEXANDER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE print prefixed, is rather given as a curio&s;ity, than as pre&s;enting an accurate portrait of this monarch. It is taken from a copy, in the collection of the earl of Buchan, from an ancient limning, formerly in the Col|lege of Arms, London.</P>
<P>Alexander III. was born on the 4th of September, 1241. He a&s;cended the throne, a minor not eight years of age, 13th July 1249, on the death of his father Alexander II. His life was di&s;tingui&s;hed by virtues; his reign by wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice. His accidental death, on the 16th March 1286, left Scotland a prey to the ambition of the Engli&s;h monarch, Edward I.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Annals of Scotland, by Sir David Dalrymple, vol. I. <HI>&s;ub annis.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The coronation of Edward took place on the 19th of Augu&s;t, 1274. Alexander, with his queen, and many of his nobility, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the ceremony;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> as did Llewellyn, prince of Wales. From the delineation here given, it al&s;o appears, that Alexander and Llewellyn &s;at in the hou&s;e of peers, in a parliament held, as u&s;ual, after the inauguration.</P>
<P>This repre&s;entation of the hou&s;e of peers is curious and intere&s;ting. The archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and York are &s;eated &s;omewhat lower than Alexander and Llewellyn: the
<PB REF="10">two per&s;ons behind the latter, are &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent the pope's amba&s;&s;adors: he behind Alexander to bear the deed of homage for the lands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that monarch in England. The mitred abbots amount to nineteen; while the bi&s;hops pre&s;ent are only eight; the temporal peers, twenty. In the mid&s;t, the chancellor and judges appear on their wool&s;acks.</P>

<P>This captivity was neverthele&s;s attended with eminent advantages.

<P>The regencies of Robert, and Murdac, dukes of Al|bany, had been fertile in public abu&s;es: and the dilapi|dation of the royal lands and revenues, which they had &s;hared among the nobles, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h their own power, expo&s;ed the new &s;overeign to a choice of difficulties. His reign mu&s;t be degraded by penury; or rendered dan|gerous by the arduous ta&s;k of re&s;uming the royal patri|mony. The &s;pirit and genius of James preferred the latter alternative; and, after a long &s;eries of national di&s;|order, the &s;word of ju&s;tice at length filled the hand of the monarch, and fla&s;hed in the eyes of an u&s;urping ari&s;to|cracy. The mo&s;t guilty of the public depredators fell
<PB REF="13">under the axe of the law: neither rank, nor even royal blood, could &s;ave them from equal ju&s;tice. Terror for a time &s;eized the peers, and e&s;tabli&s;hed tranquillity.

<P>JAMES IV married Margaret of England, daughter of Henry VII, in Augu&s;t 1503; but many mi&s;carriages and early deaths intervened before a vivacious fruit of their union appeared. James V was born on the 10th of April 1512:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. Reg. Scot. M S. in Bibl. Reg. 13 B.

<P>John duke of Albany a&s;&s;umed the regency in May 1515; and held it, with &s;ome intervals of ab&s;ence in France, until July 1524; when Margaret regained the &s;upreme power. In the following year &s;he was con&s;trained to &s;hare it with Beton the chancellor, and Angus her hu&s;|band: and, in 1526, the latter u&s;urped the &s;ole autho|rity.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, Buchanan, Lind&s;ay, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the beginning of July 1528, James bur&s;t from the fetters of Angus, in his &s;eventeenth year, and the fir&s;t act of his power was the forfeiture and bani&s;hment of that peer, his brothers, friends, and adherents. After a &s;hort, but active and ju&s;t exerci&s;e of &s;overeignty, he died on the 14th December, 1542, a victim to the embarra&s;&s;ments of the time, and his own high &s;pirit.

<HEAD>MARY OF GUISE, QUEEN OF JAMES V.</HEAD>
<P>MAGDALEN of France, the fir&s;t wife of James V, having died in July 1537, in the &s;eventh month af|ter the marriage, he, in the &s;ub&s;equent year, wedded Mary of Gui&s;e, or Lorraine. This lady was the daughter of Claude, duke of Gui&s;e, a branch of the hou&s;e of Lorraine; and widow of Louis duke of Longueville.

<P>During the life of her hu&s;band &s;he appears to have taken no part in the political intrigues of a bu&s;y and important period. On his death, in Dec. 1542, &s;he was immer&s;ed in the di&s;putes between cardinal Beton and Arran, con|cerning the regency: and after the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the for|mer, in 1546, &s;he began to a&s;&s;ume an active &s;hare in the government. In&s;tigated by the coun&s;els of her brothers, the duke of Gui&s;e and the cardinal of Lorraine, &s;he a&s;|pired to the regency, which &s;he at length obtained in April 1554. But, amid the vehemence of the prote&s;tant and catholic parties, her &s;ituation was expo&s;ed to numer|ous difficulties; and her death on the 10th of June 1560, may be partly imputed to their pre&s;&s;ure.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's Hi&s;t, of Scotland, I. 122, 137, 229.</NOTE></P>

<P>The execution of William, &s;ixth earl of Douglas, in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, 1440, had not quieted the rebel|lious &s;pirit of that great family; and in 1452 James was, in the efferve&s;cence of pa&s;&s;ion, provoked to &s;tab William, the eighth earl of Douglas, with his own hand, in the ca&s;tle of Stirling. James, the &s;ucceeding earl, rai&s;ed &s;ome commotions, which were &s;peedily appea&s;ed, and the public tranquillity re&s;tored.</P>
<P>But in 1454 the grand rebellion of the hou&s;e of Douglas commenced, which &s;hook the Scoti&s;h throne, and was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed with much difficulty. In 1455 a forfeiture was led again&s;t the hou&s;e of Douglas; and the four brothers, James it's chief, the earls of Moray and Ormond, and
<PB REF="22">lord Balveny, were doomed to expiate, by death or exile, the vengeance of their offended monarch and country. Yet in the cour&s;e of a few years the branch of Angus &s;uc|ceeded to the exorbitant power of the &s;tem. Such &s;tran|gers were the monarchs to modern theoretic ideas of a de&s;ign to &s;ubvert the ari&s;tocracy; while, in fact, all they attempted was to with&s;tand its incroachments, when they became ab&s;olutely incompatible with royalty.</P>
<P>On the 3d of Augu&s;t, 1460, James II was accidentally &s;lain by the bur&s;ting of a cannon, while he was be&s;ieging Roxburgh.</P>
<P>James II was a prince of eminent &s;pirit; and his mea|&s;ures were deci&s;ive even to violence. The ob&s;curity at|tending his reign renders his private life little known. His per&s;on, according to a dry but veracious author, was robu&s;t; and a red &s;tain, which covered one &s;ide of his countenance, gave ri&s;e to the vulgar epithet of James with the Fiery Face.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John Major, or Mair, p. 822, 826.

<P>THIS portrait is taken from a painting at Kiel|berg, near Tubingen in Germany, the &s;eat of the Von Lytrums.</P>

<P>Lord Buchan in con&s;equence applied to M.

<P>The editor was led to &s;uppo&s;e that this prince was James IV, becau&s;e the contemporary &s;overeigns were of his reign, or &s;oon after. But he now inclines to infer James I, from the following rea&s;ons.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. M. Gognel named it the latter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The features cor|re&s;pond &s;o much with the fine portrait of James I
<PB REF="40">in John&s;ton's In&s;criptions, that the beard, and more advanced years, &s;eem to form the only difference.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The crown over the arms is too &s;imple for the time of James IV; that of James III having fleurons of quite a different height and richne&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The hat re|&s;embles that of Charles VII of France, contemporary with James I, in Mezeray.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The jacket is not &s;la&s;hed. There is in Montfaucon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon. T. iii. pl. 64.</NOTE> a portrait of Charles duke of Burgundy, &s;lain in 1477, in this very dre&s;s, with the chain of the golden fleece; but the jacket is &s;la&s;hed in &s;trait lines: and this fa&s;hion of &s;la&s;hing appears in the genuine portrait of James IV.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The &s;hoes, with chains, are &s;o rare, that it is probable they were only known in the latter part of the reign of Richard II, and in that of Henry IV, who died in 1413, when James I was twenty years of age, and had been a captive for eight years. Long peaks are common, and appear in the &s;tatutes of Ed|ward IV; but no mention of chains occurs after the above period. It is improbable that Von Lytrum &s;hould from &s;uch a di&s;tance vi&s;it Scotland: but mo&s;t likely that the portrait of James I was executed in England, during his captivity, and procured there by Von Lytrum, who not being able to get that of the reigning monarch, contented him&s;elf with another.</ITEM>

This la&s;t cau&s;e, with the unwieldy &s;ize of &s;uperfluous ornaments, for the portraits them&s;elves might have appeared in 8vo, may perhaps account for the abrupt termination of a work, which the more ample it had proved, the more honourable it had been to the nation.

She came to Scotland, Augu&s;t 1561; wedded Darnley, July 1565; a widow Feb. 1567; married Bothwell two months after; fled to Eng|land May 1568; beheaded 7 Feb. 1587, aged 44 years and 2 months, after a captivity of nearly nineteen years, the very term of that of James I of Scotland.</P>
<P>The fictitious portraits of Mary are infinite. In &s;ome of them &s;he is confounded with Mary of Gui&s;e her mother, with Mary queen of France, &s;i&s;ter of Henry VIII, and even with Mary of Medici. But any hand&s;ome woman is, with the picture dealers, Mary of Scotland. The follow|ing are the mo&s;t authentic portraits.</P>
<P>The Scoti&s;h &s;ilver coin of 1553 gives her bu&s;t at 11 years of age; the gold, 1555, at 13. The &s;ilver, 1561, &s;hould be at 19. There is, it is believed, at Holyrood-hou&s;e a portrait about 14, pale.</P>
<P>Cock of Antwerp in 1559 engraved a fine print, three quarters, in her &s;eventeenth year. Mr. Harding's half length is faithfully copied from this print, which the editor
<PB REF="45">has &s;een in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir William Mu&s;grave. The &s;mall eyes, and oval features, occur in all the genuine por|traits; but this has not that ri&s;e in the middle of the no&s;e, which appears in the others.

<P>The portraits by El&s;track, and a good modern profile by Stewart, may be cla&s;&s;ed between her twentieth and thirtieth year.

<P>Charles I certainly knew the picture of his grandmother. In the catalogue this piece is a&s;cribed to <HI>the younger</HI> Jennet, and is mentioned as a pre&s;ent of lord Danby. It is a deli|cate &s;mall picture; the face is very pale, perhaps by the fading of the painter's carnation. Auburn hair, black eyes.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame age may be that in John&s;ton's In&s;crip|tions; which, if the drawing were &s;omewhat mended, would be a valuable portrait. It is publi&s;hed fifteen years after her death.</P>

<P>William Forbes, a native of Aberdeen, and Prin|cipal of the Mari&s;hal college there, was nominated bi&s;hop on the 26th of January 1634; but he only &s;urvived his appointment about two months, dying on the 1&s;t of April that year.

<P>THIS magnanimous prince a&s;cended the throne on the 24th of June, 1488, aged &s;ixteen, and fell in the unhappy battle of Flodden, 9th September, 1513, in the fortieth and fir&s;t year of his age, and twenty-&s;ixth of his reign, which forms an epoch of the greate&s;t pro&s;perity to which Scotland a&s;cended, while a &s;eparate Power.</P>
<P>A complete knight of chivalry, generous, magnifi|cent, a patron of the arts, gentle, affable, ju&s;t; had his prudence equalled his other qualities, he would have been one of the greate&s;t of monarchs. But his im|petuo&s;ity of temper hurried him into two romantic and ab&s;urd wars with England; in the latter of which him&s;elf and a great part of his nobility fell, and the kingdom was left a prey to anarchy.</P>

<P><PB REF="53">"Item. Be&s;ide the door, the picture of king James IV of Scotland, with a faulcon on his fi&s;t, done after an ancient water-coloured piece; half a figure, &s;o big as the life, in a carved frame. Length 3 f. 1. Breadth 2 f. o. Done by Daniel Mytens."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In that of the pictures of James II, No. 879 is "James IV, of Scot|land half length with a hawk on his fi&s;t;" apparently the &s;ame. This piece was at Whitehall, in both reigns; and mu&s;t have fallen into private hands after the fire in 1697. In the &s;ame collection two pictures of "<HI>King James</HI> with a hawk on his fi&s;t" are of James VI at five years of age, as appears from MSS. catalogues.</NOTE></P>
<P>The picture has been put on fre&s;h canvas, and reframed; and the &s;ize now is 3 feet 2 inches, by 2 feet and one quarter of an inch: a variation owing to the new frame not being &s;o broad in the inner margin as the ancient.

<P>THE Vandyke of Scotland, was &s;on of Andrew Jame&s;on, a builder, and was born at Aberdeen in 1586. The portraits by him at Taymouth are &s;aid to have been executed before he &s;tudied in Flanders;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So the late Lord Hailes thought, but this opinion is very doubtful; and the author of the Sketch of Painting in Scotland (Weekly Magazine, Vol. XV. Bee Vol. XVIII.) a&s;&s;erts, with great probability, that Jame&s;on re+turned to Scotland in 1628.</NOTE> and as one piece there is dated 1635, it would appear that he was advanced in years before he vi&s;ited Ru|bens. He died at Edinburgh in 1644, aged 58; and was buried in the Gray-Friars churchyard.</P>
<P>For &s;ome account of his works the reader may con|&s;ult the valuable "Anecdotes of Painting in England;" nor is much additional information to be procured. Dr. Arthur John&s;ton, in his Parerga, Aberdeen, 1637, addre&s;&s;es a &s;mall poem to Jame&s;on, in&s;tructing him how to paint the beautiful lady Ann Campbell. One of his mo&s;t curious paintings is at Cullen hou&s;e, het &s;eat of the Earl of Finlater: it is his own portrait, &s;itting in his painting-room, the walls of which are hung with pictures; probably &s;uch of his own as he mo&s;t valued.</P>
<P>Jame&s;on is the fir&s;t Scoti&s;h painter on record; but eminent foreigners had vi&s;ited Scotland, and painted illu&s;trious portraits. The mo&s;t curious a&s;&s;emblage of the kind is in the old gallery of the palace at Scone; a hunting-piece, in which James VI. and his chief courtiers appear. Alexander, the &s;cholar of Jame&s;on, married his daughter; and Co&s;mo Alexander engraved a portrait of Jame&s;on, his great grandfather, in 1728. The elder Scougal, an imitator of Lely, and Corrudes, a foreigner, appeared in Charles the Second's reign; and were followed by De Wyck, or De Wit, and by
<PB REF="68">the younger Scougal. To them &s;ucceeded Hude, and Medina, both foreigners; and Wait and Aikman, na|tives.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sketch above quoted.

<P>About 1563 he appears among the eccle&s;ia&s;tic lords of Se&s;&s;ion; and in 1565 is commendator of the abbey of Lindoris, and bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s.</P>
<P>His attachment to Mary, and his &s;ufferings in her cau&s;e, are well known.

<P>THIS exqui&s;ite painting is in complete pre&s;ervation, though executed, as appears from the age of the prince, ten or twelve, about 1482 or 1484. Originally intended for an altar-piece, it is in two divi&s;ions, painted on both &s;ides. The fir&s;t divi&s;ion contains, on one &s;ide, the king, prince, and St. Andrew, as here: on the rever&s;e is the trinity, the father an old man with the dead Chri&s;t on his knees, while the holy gho&s;t is, as u&s;ual, typified by a dove. The other divi&s;ion pre&s;ents the queen and a &s;aint, apparently Canute the patron of Denmark, and perhaps the features may be tho&s;e of her father Chri&s;tiern I: the rever&s;e bears the eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and angels.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t compartment is rich in effect; and it is hoped the copy will pre&s;ent an adequate idea of the original. The king's gown is cloth of gold, the robes of a lilac pur|ple. The lion of the arms is crowned, and the tre&s;&s;ure does not go round the top.</P>
<P>It has been &s;urmized that the &s;aint might wear the fea|tures of Shevis, archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews, a favourite of James; but the eccle&s;ia&s;tics did not then pre&s;erve their beards, and the character of the face &s;eems ideal.</P>

<HEAD>JAMES III.</HEAD>
<P>THIS monarch a&s;cended the throne on the 10th of Augu&s;t 1460, in the eighth year of his age; and was &s;lain, after the civil conflict at Sauchy, on the 18th June 1488, in the thirty-&s;ixth year of his age.</P>
<P>His reign was di&s;tingui&s;hed by many memorable events, the recapture of Roxburgh and Berwick; and the acqui&s;i|tion of the Orkney i&s;lands, by his marriage with the daugh|ter of Denmark. The chief &s;tain on it is, the murder of the earl of Mar younge&s;t brother of James; an incident the more &s;ingular, as that king was aver&s;e from blood&mdash;and though all hi&s;torical evidence infer the guilt, yet the rebel|lious peers, eager to expo&s;e every fault of the government, never impute this to their &s;overeign's charge. If true, James mu&s;t have been infatuated by his love of a&s;trology, which predicted to him his death by one of his neare&s;t kindred&mdash;and Mar may not have been innocent of a con|&s;piracy again&s;t his brother's life. Certain it is that Albany, the &s;econd brother, a&s;pired to the crown, and termed James III a ba&s;tard.</P>
<P>But the &s;overeignty of James was weak, de&s;potic, and impolitic; and his warm attachment to the arts forms the mo&s;t plea&s;ing part of his character. His love of architec|ture rai&s;ed Cochran to the chief power in the &s;tate; and Rogers the Engli&s;h mu&s;ician was in high favour. The fe|rocious nobles de&s;pi&s;ed what they e&s;teemed the frivolous pur&s;uits of the king; and, &s;trangers to the arts, could not e&s;timate their value. Of the patronage afforded by James III to foreign arti&s;ts, this noble painting may pre&s;ent no unfavourable &s;pecimen.</P>
<P><PB REF="80">Of the per&s;on of James III Drummond gives the be&s;t de&s;cription. "This king, concerning his per&s;onage, was of a &s;tature &s;omewhat higher than ordinary, his hair was black, his vi&s;age was rather long than round, approaching in colour more to tho&s;e in the &s;outhern than northern cli|mates." This fallow complexion appears in the picture; which be&s;ides corre&s;ponds &s;o much with Drummond's deli|neation, that it may be borrowed from the painting. And the complexion of James, &s;o different from that of the Stuart race in general, may have had its weight in the calumnies of Albany, e&s;pecially con&s;idering the amorous propen&s;ity of Mary of Gelder his mother. Eyes and hair black: there is &s;omewhat of melancholy in the face, height|ened in the original by a dark tinge even in the whites of the eyes.</P>

<P>With the defect of a feeble character, he had the high merit of being a pacific monarch; a very little learning, a very little knowledge, being &s;ufficient to &s;hew the advan|tages of peace over war, both to the king and the people. Even his &s;hort peaceful reign greatly advanced the trade, agriculture, and colonies of the kingdom: and if, by way of &s;peculation, we could imagine it prolonged to the pre&s;ent epoch, the three realms would have been as one garden, as another China, in univer&s;al wealth and indu&s;try.</P>

<HEAD>ANNE OF DENMARK, QUEEN OF JAMES VI,</HEAD>
<P>WAS the daughter of Frederic II king of Denmark and Norway. In October 1589 James proceeded him&s;elf in que&s;t of his bride, as his grandfather James V had &s;et an example of this gallantry. They were married in Denmark; and Anne was crowned in the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P>She died in March 1619.</P>
<P>The character of Anne of Denmark was the rever&s;e of that of her countrywoman, Margaret wife of James III. Amorous, bold, intriguing, impre&s;&s;ed with little reverence for her hu&s;band's &s;pirit, or abilities for government, &s;he was immer&s;ed in polities, though her &s;upreme cunning have veiled her from hi&s;torical ob&s;ervation. That, in particular, &s;he had no &s;mall &s;hare in the Gowrie con&s;piracy, may per|haps be &s;hewn by the editor, in a &s;hort tract on that em|broiled &s;ubject. At pre&s;ent he &s;hall only hint that the main actor, Gowrie's brother, was a paramour of Anne, that &s;he highly offended James by her continued favour to the for|feited family; that the earl of Gowrie him&s;elf appears to have been entirely innocent, and that Anne's ambition might con&s;pire with her lover's infatuation, to impri&s;on her hu&s;band, and rival Elizabeth in female &s;overeignty.

<HEAD>HENRY SCOUGAL, PROFESSOR OF DIVINITY AT ABERDEEN,</HEAD>
<P>WAS the &s;on of Patrick Scougal bi&s;hop of Aberdeen 1664&mdash;1682; and has the merit of being the fir&s;t Scoti&s;h author, it is believed, who wrote a book of practi|cal piety. Eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;putes, &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the meek &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity, had fir&s;t prevailed between the catholics and reformers, then between the epi&s;copals and pre&s;byterians, and afterwards between the pre&s;byterians and independents. Sermons, and commentaries on &s;cripture were &s;ometimes interpo&s;ed; but the chief object, the prac|tice of the Chri&s;tian virtues, was unaccountably neglected; Durham's curious work, On Scandal, being rather a di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion of eccle&s;ia&s;tic di&s;cipline and polity, and a defence of the pre&s;byterians again&s;t the independent Jacobins of the day, than an ethical production.</P>
<P>Of Henry Scougal little is known. It is &s;aid that, being of an amorous complexion, he &s;ometimes loved God, and &s;ometimes loved women; and that having unfortunately become enamoured of a married lady at Aberdeen, he died in the &s;truggles of virtue and pa&s;&s;ion. But he had grown &s;o corpulent in his retreat, the &s;teeple of the cathedral church of St. Machan's, at Old Aberdeen, that his execu|tors were forced to extract the body through a window. The&s;e traditions &s;eem rather incon&s;i&s;tent, as love is gene|rally &s;uppo&s;ed rather to belong to the cla&s;s of con&s;umptions, than of drop&s;ies; and it is rare that the amorous &s;wain pines away into plenitude.</P>
<P>Scougal's Life of God in the &s;oul of man was publi&s;hed by Bi&s;hop Burnet, in 1691, 8vo; and has &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed through many editions, being a work of eminent piety, without enthu&s;ia&s;m, and written in a clear neat &s;tyle.</P>

<HEAD>ALEXANDER HENDERSON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Franklin of the Scoti&s;h commotions in la&s;t century was mini&s;ter at Leuchars: and was in vain tempted with a bi&s;hopric. He died in 1649, regretting the exce&s;s to which affairs were carried; but never repent|ing of his own moderate motives and actions, as vainly repeated by his opponents; a &s;tale device of party.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Baillie's Letters 2 vols. 8vo.</NOTE></P>
<P>In fact the pre&s;byterians, after overturning the epi&s;copal de&s;poti&s;m of the time, were gradually ruining their own cau&s;e by a de&s;poti&s;m far more di&s;gui&s;ting. The &s;aints at|tempted to e&s;tabli&s;h a clerical ari&s;tocracy, not only over Scotland, but over England; and the civil power would have become the mere &s;lave of eccle&s;ia&s;tic cen&s;ure, and excommunication. Liberty of con&s;cience was entirely de|nied by the pre&s;byterian party; their church polity was a part of their creed; and the penalty again&s;t any diffent was excommunication in this world, and a liberal inheritance in hell fire hereafter. A man's private life was to be tainted with &s;aint&s;hip or hypocri&s;y; and every plea&s;ure was to va|ni&s;h at the nod of tho&s;e phy&s;icians of Sancho the governor. The pre&s;byterians &s;upported the regal power, as a &s;hield again&s;t the independents, and &s;ectaries; who, with far &s;upe|rior political &s;kill, allowed univer&s;al liberty of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>But a nonde&s;cript &s;aint, named Cromwell, put him&s;elf at the head of the independents, and completely overthrew the pre&s;byterian de&s;poti&s;m. Both parties appealed to King Chri&s;t, and he decided in favour of the democratic church.</P>
<P>In the &s;ole choice left, between the impertinent autho|rity, and degrading &s;uper&s;tition, of the pre&s;byterians, and
<PB REF="91">the power merely military of Cromwell, it is no wonder that the nation &s;ighed for the ancient monarchy; a govern|ment at lea&s;t of gentlemen over gentlemen, and more bene|ficent to all, than that of par&s;ons or &s;oldiers over &s;laves.</P>
<P>Hender&s;on's favourite polity, and the clerical ari&s;to|cracy, were after his death to be trampled under foot; but be timou&s;ly e&s;caped from the evils to come. One of the chief events of his life was, the &s;olemn conference with Charles I at Newca&s;tle, on various topics of religion and government; the relation has been printed, and does honour to both parties.</P>

<P>She died in Augu&s;t 1445, in her twenty &s;econd year, her exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility being unable to dige&s;t a &s;landerous expre&s;&s;ion of a ba&s;e courtier. Her marriage had been un|happy; the character of her hu&s;band, afterwards the infa|mous Louis XI, being malignant to an inconceivable degree.</P>
<P>Margaret was not only celebrated as a patrone&s;s of men of letters, but was her&s;elf a proficient in French poetry, having compo&s;ed many rondeaux and ballads. In the exami|nations taken concerning the cau&s;e of her death, it is men|tioned that &s;he would &s;it up all night, writing poetry; and would compo&s;e twelve rondeaux in a day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">clos, Hi&s;t. de Louis XI, Vol. III.</NOTE></P>
<P>This portrait is taken from the Monumens de la Monar|chie Francoi&s;e of Montfaucon; and is not only intere&s;ting in it&s;elf, but as &s;hewing the dre&s;s of the times. The like|ne&s;s may be con&s;idered as verified by the plate next given by Montfaucon, from the &s;ame MS. and which pre&s;ents a ge|nuine portrait of Charles VII.</P>

<HEAD>SEALS. THE THREE FIRST PLATES.</HEAD>
<P>THE plan of this work, as may be judged from the Pro&s;pectus, entirely differs from tho&s;e of Birch, Per|rault, Hoffman, or the like; not being intended as a &s;plendid publication of fine portraits, but as a variegated a&s;&s;emblage of ancient portraits in particular, repre&s;ented without any improvement, and in the ju&s;t colours of the various &s;ources whence they are taken. Vertue, in his heads of the Engli&s;h monarchs, has &s;ometimes been obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;eals; and they at any rate &s;hew the <HI>co&s;tume</HI> of the time, and may &s;ometimes &s;erve to identify larger and more exact deli|neations. In the middle ages &s;eals al&s;o pre&s;ent &s;ome of the be&s;t monuments of art, and mu&s;t &s;upply the want of medals.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t plate contains tho&s;e of David earl of Hun|tingdon, afterwards David I;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;eals of Alex.

There is al&s;o in Ander&s;on's Diplomata a &s;eal of David earl of Huntingdon, brother of Malcom IV, and &s;on of Henry earl of Northum|berland; but as it varies little from the la&s;t it is omitted.</P>

<HEAD>SEALS. THE THREE LAST PLATES.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t is of Robert I, or Great, 1306&mdash;1329. This is from a charter dated in his ninth year. Mr. A&s;tle, in his late publication of Scoti&s;h &s;eals, gives another, u&s;ed by Robert I towards the clo&s;e of his reigned. In the &s;ame plate is that of David. II &s;on of Robert I, who reigned from A. D. 1329 to 1371.</P>
<P>The &s;econd plate of this &s;et contains that of Edward Baliol, who twice u&s;urped the throne, during the reign of David II, fir&s;t for three months Sept&mdash;Dec. 1332, and la&s;tly for five years 1333&mdash;1338: and that of Robert II, the fir&s;t of the hou&s;e of Stuart, 1371,&mdash;1390.</P>
<P>On the third plate the fir&s;t in order. of time is that of Euphemia Ro&s;s &s;econd wife, but &s;ole queen, of Robert II. The rever&s;e only bears the arms of David, Earl Palatine of Strathern, her &s;on, who joins in the deed, dated 1375; in which they agree with Alexander Murray of Drum&s;ergath, that he &s;hall wed lady Jonet of Monymu&s;k, &s;i&s;ter of the queen, and be &s;upported in his claim of inheriting &s;ome e&s;tate; and that Walter Murray, his brother, may if he chu&s;e marry the elde&s;t daughter of the &s;aid Jonet. This cu|rious &s;eal repre&s;ents Euphemia, clothed in the clo&s;e kirtle and mantle of the times, with a particular &s;cepter alloted to the queens of Scotland in her hand. The Gothic architecture is well delineated; on her right hand are the arms of Scot|land; on her left tho&s;e of Ro&s;s. She appears to have died about 1387.</P>
<P>The next &s;eal in order of time is that of Robert III, 1390&mdash;1406. The beard agrees better with the de&s;cription
<PB REF="117">of his per&s;on, given by the continuator of Fordun, than the portrait in John&s;on's <HI>In&s;criptiones.</HI></P>
<P>That at the top of the plate is of Robert duke of Albany, Regent of Scotland, 1406&mdash;1419. The ducal coronet is of a &s;ingular form.</P>
<P>All the&s;e plates are from that rare and high-priced work, Ander&s;on's Diplomata.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of the engravers of &s;eals in the middle ages is ob&s;cure. They were probably often Greeks from Con|&s;tantinople, &s;ometimes Italians, and laterly Flemings.</P>
<P>The &s;eals of the four fir&s;t Jameses are all from the &s;ame dye&mdash;and are be&s;ides unimportant, as from James I. the portraits of our monarchs are &s;ufficiently identified. In this ca&s;e, as in the former of Alex. I, David I, and Malcom IV, the fir&s;t &s;eal alone is entitled to any attention.</P>
