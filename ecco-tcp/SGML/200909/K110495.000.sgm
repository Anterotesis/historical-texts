<P>AS the Writer of this volume could not, for very obvious rea&s;ons, entertain the mo&s;t di&s;tant inten|tion of &s;tanding forth the profe&s;&s;ed Biographer of LIN|NAEUS, he wi&s;hes to preclude any undue expectations, by ob&s;erving that, the few memoirs relating to the life of this celebrated Profe&s;&s;or, which will be found inter|&s;per&s;ed in the fir&s;t part of this <HI>View,</HI> were almo&s;t wholly collected from LINNAEUS'S own writings, and other printed works; and &s;erve, principally, to relieve the tediou&s;ne&s;s of a bare account of books, and to connect in a better man|ner the &s;eries and occa&s;ion of his publications. He re|grets that his &s;ources of intelligence have not been &s;uf|ficiently copious to enable him to render the&s;e memoirs more equal to his wi&s;hes, and more worthy the accept|ance of the public. To tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant with the works of LINNAEUS, he is perfectly aware that the&s;e pages can afford but little amu&s;ement and &s;till le&s;s in|formation, and can have no merit in their eye, beyond that of recalling to their remembrance, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of facts and ob&s;ervations, with which they were before ac|quainted. They will, however, concur with him in wi&s;hing to diffu&s;e the knowledge of the writings of &s;o great a ma&s;ter, and in endeavouring to excite an emula|tion in younger minds, for that &s;cience which they cul|tivate.</P>
<P>All the works of LINNAEUS, as far as they have come to the Author's knowledge, are noticed in the &s;ucceeding pages; but, as mo&s;t of them were &s;ub&s;ervient to his great object the SYSTEM <HI>of</HI> NATURE, the <HI>outlines</HI> of that work bear a principal part in this <HI>View</HI> of his writings.</P>
<P>The CLASSIFICATION <HI>of</HI> DISEASES, is but a &s;mall part of his works; yet, as LINNAEUS was an early writer
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
on that &s;ubject, which has &s;ince excited the attention of many phy&s;icians, and is at this day not &s;ufficiently di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, it hath therefore been exhibited more largely than many of his other writings.</P>
<P>The AMOENITATES ACADEMICAE, although &s;trictly &s;peaking they are not LINNAEUS'S own works, have yet &s;o large a &s;hare of his authority &s;tamped upon them, are &s;o intimately connected with his writings, and, it is pre|&s;umed, are &s;o much le&s;s known than they de&s;erve to be, that it was judged proper to give a <HI>brief</HI> account of the <HI>whole</HI> collection.</P>
<P>The PAN SUECUS having been fir&s;t pre&s;ented to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reader &s;everal years ago, by the Author of this vo|lume, in a periodical publication, is here &s;ubjoined, with additional ob&s;ervations, and &s;ome improvements in the general arrangement of the tables.</P>
<P>Few or no critici&s;ms on the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;y&s;tem will be found in the&s;e pages. No &s;y&s;tem yet invented can &s;tand a rigorous examination through all its parts, and LIN|NAEUS was, perhaps, better acquainted than any other man with the defects of his own. The &s;tudy of nature on &s;cientific principles, notwith&s;tanding the manifold improvements of later years, may yet ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as in its infancy, and all arrangements hitherto propo&s;ed, have, in their turns, given way to others. At pre&s;ent the &s;y&s;tem of LINNAEUS po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the advantage of a gene|ral &s;uperiority in the public approbation: how long it may enjoy this pre-eminence, time only can di&s;cover: in the mean while, it would be a more agreeable employ|ment, to endeavour to &s;trengthen its ba&s;is, &s;upply its de|ficiences, and candidly correct its errors, than to <HI>object</HI> to tho&s;e anomalies and imperfections, which will mo&s;t likely be ever in&s;eparable from <HI>artificial</HI> arrangements; and as to <HI>natural</HI> method, it is as yet &s;o far unknown, that, in the <HI>vegetable</HI> kingdom Botani&s;ts them&s;elves are not agreed on what principles it ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>A GENERAL VIEW OF THE WRITINGS OF THE LATE CELEBRATED LINNAEUS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES VON LINN&Egrave;, the &s;on of a <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> divine, was born May 24, 1707, at <HI>Roe&s;hult,</HI> in the province of <HI>Smaland,</HI> in <HI>Sweden;</HI> of which place his father had the cure, when this &s;on was born, but was &s;oon after preferred to the living of <HI>Stenbrihult,</HI> in the &s;ame province, where dying in 1748, at the age of 70, he was &s;ucceeded in his cure by another &s;on. We are told, in the commemoration-&s;peech on this celebrated man, de|livered in his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence, before the royal academy of &s;ciences at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> that the ance&s;tors of this family took their &s;irnames of LINNAEUS, <HI>Lindelius,</HI> and <HI>Tiliander,</HI> from a large <HI>lime-tree,</HI> or <HI>linden-tree,</HI> yet &s;tanding on the farm where <HI>Linnaeus</HI> was born; and that this origin of &s;irnames, taken from natural objects, is not very uncommon in <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">
This eminent man, who&s;e talents enabled him to reform the whole &s;cience of natural hi&s;tory, ac|cumulated, very early in life, &s;ome of the highe&s;t honours that await the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful proficients in medical &s;cience; &s;ince we find that he was made <HI>profe&s;&s;or</HI> of <HI>phy&s;ic</HI> and <HI>botany,</HI> in the univer&s;ity of <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> at the age of 34; and &s;ix years afterwards, phy&s;ician to his &s;overeign, the late king <HI>Adolphus;</HI> who in the year 1753 honoured him &s;till farther, by creating him knight of the order of the <HI>Polar Star.</HI> His honours did not terminate here, for in 1757 he was ennobled; and in 1776 the pre&s;ent king of <HI>Sweden</HI> accepted the re&s;ignation of his office, and rewarded his declining years by dou|bling his pen&s;ion, and by a liberal donation of landed property, &s;ettled on him and his family.</P>
<P>It &s;eems probable, that his father's example fir&s;t gave <HI>Linnaeus</HI> a ta&s;te for the &s;tudy of nature; who, as he has him&s;elf informed us, cultivated, as his fir&s;t amu&s;ement, a garden plentifully &s;tored with plants. Young <HI>Linnaeus</HI> &s;oon became acquainted with the&s;e, as well as the indigenous ones of his neighbourhood. Yet, from the &s;traightne&s;s of his father's income, our young naturali&s;t was on the point of being de&s;tined to a mechanical employ|ment: fortunately, however, this de&s;ign was over|ruled. In 1717 he was &s;ent to &s;chool at <HI>Wex&s;io,</HI> where, as his opportunities were enlarged, his progre&s;s in all his favourite pur&s;uits was propor|tionably extended. At this early period he paid attention to other branches of natural hi&s;tory; par|ticularly to the knowledge of in&s;ects: in which, as is manife&s;t from his <HI>oration</HI> on the &s;ubject, he mu&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="8">
very early have made a great proficiency, &s;ince we find that he was not le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful herein, than in that of plants, having given them an arrangement, and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch characters of di&s;tinction, as have been univer&s;ally followed by &s;ucceeding ento|mologi&s;ts.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of his academical education, <HI>Lin|naeus</HI> received under profe&s;&s;or <HI>Stobaeus,</HI> at <HI>Lund,</HI> in <HI>Scania,</HI> who favoured his inclinations to the &s;tudy of natural hi&s;tory. After a re&s;idence of about a year, he removed in 1728 to <HI>Up&s;al.</HI> Here he &s;oon contracted a clo&s;e friend&s;hip with <HI>Artedi,</HI> a native of the province of <HI>Angermannia,</HI> who had already been four years a &s;tudent in that univer&s;ity, and, like him&s;elf, had a &s;trong bent to the &s;tudy of na|tural hi&s;tory in general, but particularly to <HI>Ich|thyology.</HI> He was moreover well &s;killed in chemi&s;try, and not unacquainted with botany, having been the inventor of that di&s;tinction in <HI>umbelliferous</HI> plants, ari&s;ing from the differences of the <HI>involucrum.</HI> Emulation is the &s;oul of improvement, and, heigh|tened as it was in this in&s;tance by friend&s;hip, proved a mo&s;t powerful incentive. The&s;e young men pro&s;ecuted their &s;tudies together with uncom|mon vigor, mutually communicating their ob&s;erva|tions, and laying their plans, &s;o as to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in every branch of natural hi&s;tory and phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>Soon after his re&s;idence at <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> our author was al&s;o happy enough to obtain the favour of &s;everal gentlemen of e&s;tabli&s;hed character in litera|ture. He was in a particular manner encouraged in the pur&s;uit of his &s;tudies by the patronage of
<PB N="4" REF="9">
Dr. <HI>Olaus Cel&s;ius,</HI> at that time profe&s;&s;or of divinity, and the re&s;torer of natural hi&s;tory in <HI>Sweden;</HI> &s;ince &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for oriental learning, and more particularly for his <HI>Hierobotanicon,</HI> or <HI>Critical Di&s;|&s;ertations on the Plants mentioned in Scripture.</HI> This gentleman is &s;aid to have given LINNAEUS a large &s;hare of his e&s;teem, and he was fortunate enough to obtain it very early after his removal to <HI>Up&s;al.</HI> He was at that time meditating his <HI>Hierobotanicon,</HI> and being &s;truck with the diligence of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> in de&s;cribing the plants of the <HI>Up&s;al</HI> garden, and his exten&s;ive knowledge of their names, fortunately for him, at that time involved in difficulties, from the narrow circum&s;tances of his parents, <HI>Cel&s;ius</HI> not only patronized him in a general way, but admitted him to his hou&s;e, his table, and his library. Un|der &s;uch encouragement, it is not &s;trange that our author made a rapid progre&s;s, both in his &s;tudies, and the e&s;teem of the profe&s;&s;ors: in fact, we have a very &s;triking proof of his merit and attainments, ina&s;much as we find, that after only two years re|&s;idence, he was thought &s;ufficiently qualified to give lectures occa&s;ionally from the botanic chair, in the room of profe&s;&s;or <HI>Rudbeck.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1731, the royal academy of &s;ciences at <HI>Up&s;al</HI> having for &s;ome time meditated the de&s;ign of improving the natural hi&s;tory of <HI>Sweden,</HI> at the in&s;tance particularly of profe&s;&s;ors <HI>Cel&s;ius</HI> and <HI>Rud|beck,</HI> deputed LINNAEUS to make the tour of <HI>Lap|land,</HI> with the &s;ole view of exploring the natural hi&s;tory of that arctic region; to which underta|king, his reputation, already high as a naturali&s;t, and the &s;trength of his con&s;titution, equally re|commended
<PB N="5" REF="10">
him. This tour had been made for the fir&s;t time, with the &s;ame view, by the elder <HI>Rudbeck,</HI> in 1695, at the command of <HI>Charles</HI> XI; but unfortunately the whole fruit of that expedi|tion, except two or three copies of the <HI>Campi Ely&s;ii,</HI> peri&s;hed in the dreadful fire of <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> in 1702.</P>
<P>As this expedition could not take place till the &s;ucceeding &s;ummer, LINNAEUS &s;pent his winter with his friends and relations in the &s;outh; and particu|larly paid a vi&s;it, in January 1732, to his former preceptor <HI>Stobaeus,</HI> at <HI>Lund;</HI> whom he left in Fe|bruary, to vi&s;it his native province of <HI>Smaland,</HI> and returned to <HI>Up&s;al</HI> about the middle of April, to prepare for his journey. He left <HI>Up&s;al</HI> the 13th of May, and took his route to <HI>Gevalia,</HI> or <HI>Gevels,</HI> the principal town of <HI>Ge&s;tricia,</HI> 45 miles di&s;tant from <HI>Up&s;al.</HI> Hence he travelled through <HI>Hel&s;ingland,</HI> into <HI>Medalpadia,</HI> where he made an excur&s;ion, and a&s;|cended a remarkable mountain, before he reached <HI>Hudwick&s;wald,</HI> the chief town of <HI>Hel&s;ingland.</HI> From hence he went through <HI>Angermanland,</HI> to <HI>Herno&s;and,</HI> a &s;ea-port on the <HI>Bothnic</HI> gulph, &s;eventy miles di&s;|tant from <HI>Hudwick&s;wald.</HI> When he had proceeded thus far, he found it proper to retard his journey, as the &s;pring was not &s;ufficiently advanced; and took this opportunity of vi&s;iting tho&s;e remarkable caverns on the &s;ummit of mount <HI>Skula,</HI> though at the hazard of his life.</P>
<P>When LINNAEUS arrived at <HI>Uma,</HI> in <HI>We&s;t Bothnia,</HI> about 96 miles from <HI>Herno&s;and,</HI> he quitted the public road, and took his cour&s;e through the woods we&s;tward, in order fir&s;t to traver&s;e the mo&s;t &s;outhern parts of <HI>Lapland.</HI> Being now come to
<PB N="6" REF="11">
the country that was more particularly the object of his enquiries, equally a &s;tranger to the language and to the manners of the people, and without any a&s;&s;ociate, he committed him&s;elf to the ho&s;pi|tality of the inhabitants, and never failed to expe|rience it fully. He &s;peaks in &s;everal places, with peculiar &s;atisfaction, of the innocence and &s;impli|city of their lives, and their freedom from di&s;ea&s;es. In this excur&s;ion, he reached the mountains to|wards <HI>Norway,</HI> and, after encountering great hard|&s;hips, returned into <HI>We&s;t Bothnia,</HI> quite exhau&s;ted with fatigue. He &s;eems to have been much &s;truck with the &s;ingular u&s;e that the <HI>Laplanders</HI> make of the <HI>Pinguicula vulgaris,</HI> which we call <HI>Butterwort,</HI> or York&s;hire Sanicle: They receive the milk of the rein-deer upon the fre&s;h leaves of this plant, which they immediately &s;train off, and &s;et a&s;ide, till it becomes &s;omewhat ace&s;cent, and the whole ac|quires, in a day or two, a con&s;i&s;tence equal to that of cream, without &s;eparating the &s;erum; and by this method it becomes an agreeable food. When thus prepared, a &s;mall quantity of the &s;ame has the property of rennet, in producing the like change on fre&s;h milk. But to return: Our tra|veller next vi&s;ited <HI>Pitha</HI> and <HI>Lula,</HI> upon the gulph of <HI>Bothnia,</HI> from which latter place he took again a we&s;tern route, by proceeding up the river of that name, and vi&s;ited the ruins of the temple of <HI>Jock|mock,</HI> in <HI>Lula-Lapland</HI> or <HI>Lap-Mark;</HI> thence, he tra|ver&s;ed what is called the <HI>Lapland De&s;ert,</HI> de&s;titute of all villages, cultivation, roads, or any conve|niences; inhabited only by a few &s;traggling people, originally de&s;cended from the <HI>Finlanders,</HI> and who
<PB N="7" REF="12">
&s;ettled in this country in remote ages, being en|tirely a di&s;tinct people from the <HI>Laplanders.</HI> In this di&s;trict he a&s;cended a noted mountain called <HI>Wallevari,</HI> in &s;peaking of which he has given us a plea&s;ant relation of his finding a &s;ingular and beautiful new plant <HI>(Andromeda tetragona)</HI> when travelling within the arctic circle, with the &s;un in his view at midnight, in &s;earch of a <HI>Lapland</HI> hut. From hence he cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Lapland Alps</HI> into <HI>Finmark,</HI> and traverfed the &s;hores of the North &s;ea as far as <HI>Sallero.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e journies from <HI>Lula</HI> and <HI>Pitha,</HI> on the <HI>Bothnian</HI> gulph, to the north &s;hore, were made on foot, and our traveller was attended by two <HI>Lap|landers;</HI> one his interpreter, and the other his guide. He tells us that the vigour and &s;trength of the&s;e two men, both old, and &s;ufficiently loaded with his baggage, excited his admiration, &s;ince they appeared quite unhurt by their labour, while he him&s;elf, although young and robu&s;t, was fre|quently quite exhau&s;ted. In this journey he was wont to &s;leep under the boat with which they forded the rivers, as a defence again&s;t rain, and the gnats, which in the <HI>Lapland</HI> &s;ummer are not le&s;s teazing than in the torrid zones. In de|&s;cending one of the&s;e rivers, he narrowly e&s;caped peri&s;hing by the over&s;etting of the boat, and lo&s;t many of the natural productions which he had collected.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS thus &s;pent the greater part of the &s;ummer in examining this arctic region, and tho&s;e mountains, on which, four years afterwards, the
<PB N="8" REF="13" MS="y">
French philo&s;ophers &s;ecured immortal fame to Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton.</HI> At length, after having &s;uffered incredible fatigues and hard&s;hips, in climbing pre|cipices, pa&s;&s;ing rivers in mi&s;erable boats, &s;uffering repeated vici&s;&s;itudes of extreme heat and cold, and not unfrequently hunger and thir&s;t; he re|turned to <HI>Tornoa</HI> in September. He did not take the &s;ame route from <HI>Tornoa</HI> as when he came into <HI>Lapland,</HI> having determined to vi&s;it, and examine, the country on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the <HI>Bothnian</HI> gulph: his fir&s;t &s;tage, therefore, was to <HI>Ula,</HI> in <HI>Ea&s;t Bothnia;</HI> from thence to <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Carleby,</HI> 84 miles &s;outh from <HI>Ula.</HI> He continued his route through <HI>Wa&s;a, Chri&s;tian&s;tedi,</HI> and <HI>Biorneburgh,</HI> to <HI>Abo,</HI> a &s;mall univer&s;ity in <HI>Fin|land.</HI> Winter was now &s;etting in apace, he there|fore cro&s;&s;ed the gulph by the i&s;land of <HI>Aland,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Up&s;al</HI> in November, after having per|formed, and that mo&s;tly on foot, a journey of ten degrees of latitude in extent, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e de|viations which &s;uch a de&s;ign rendered nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The <HI>re&s;ult</HI> of this journey was not publi&s;hed till &s;everal years afterwards, during his re&s;idence in <HI>Holland.</HI> For the pre&s;ent he only gave in to the academy a <HI>Florula Lapponica,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of a very few pages in the <HI>Acta Up&s;alien&s;ia</HI> for the years 1732 and 1734. In this little catalogue the plants are di&s;po&s;ed according to the &s;y&s;tem which was after|wards called the <HI>&s;exual;</HI> and which we &s;hould not have mentioned here, but to prove how early <HI>Lin|naeus</HI> had laid the foundation of that method, which he afterwards wrought up to &s;uch perfection.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="14" MS="y">
In 1733 he vi&s;ited and examined the &s;everal mines in <HI>Sweden,</HI> and made him&s;elf &s;o well ac|quainted with <HI>mineralogy,</HI> and the <HI>docima&s;tic</HI> art, that we find he was &s;ufficiently qualified to give lectures on tho&s;e &s;ubjects, upon his return to the univer&s;ity. The outlines of his &s;y&s;tem on mi|neralogy appeared in the early editions of the <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae;</HI> but he did not exemplify the whole until the year 1768.</P>
<P>In the year 1734 LINNAEUS was &s;ent by Baron <HI>Reuterholm,</HI> governor of <HI>Dalekarlia,</HI> with &s;everal other naturali&s;ts, into that province, to inve&s;tigate the natural productions of that part of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> dominions. Each gentleman had his particular department a&s;&s;igned; and they noted daily the ob|&s;ervations made relating to geography, &amp;c.; but particularly, and as their principal object, the eco|nomical and natural hi&s;tory, and mineralogy. A full account of the&s;e ob&s;ervations was intended to have been publi&s;hed, but the de&s;ign was laid a&s;ide. It was in this journey that our author firft laid the plan of an excellent in&s;titution, which was after|wards executed in a certain degree at lea&s;t, by him&s;elf, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of many of his pupils, and the re&s;ult publi&s;hed under the title of <HI>Pan Suecus,</HI> in the &s;econd volume of the <HI>Amaenitates Academicae.</HI></P>
<P>After the completion of this expedition, it ap|pears that LINNAEUS re&s;ided for a time at <HI>Fahlun,</HI> the principal town in <HI>Dalekarlia;</HI> where he tells us that he taught <HI>mineralogy,</HI> and the <HI>docima&s;tic</HI> art, and practi&s;ed phy&s;ic; and where he was very ho&s;pitably treated by Dr. <HI>More,</HI> the phy&s;ician of
<PB N="10" REF="15" MS="y">
the place. It al&s;o appears, that he contracted at this time an intimacy with one of that gentleman's daughters, whom he married about five years afterwards, upon his &s;ettling as a <HI>phy&s;ician</HI> at <HI>Stock|holm.</HI></P>
<P>In this journey he extended his travels quite acro&s;s the <HI>Dalekarlian Alps</HI> into <HI>Norway;</HI> but we have no particular account of his di&s;coveries in that kingdom. From its &s;ituation, however, in the &s;ame parallels of latitude and of longitude, nearly, with <HI>Sweden,</HI> as well as from the face of the country, but little variety could be expected; and from the <HI>Flora Norwegica</HI> of Bp. <HI>Gunner,</HI> &s;ince publi&s;hed, the vegetable productions of na|ture appear to be nearly the &s;ame, except that the <HI>Norway</HI> coa&s;t abounds with <HI>fuci</HI> or &s;ea-wracks, not known in the <HI>Baltic.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1735, LINNAEUS travelled over many other parts of <HI>Sweden,</HI> &s;ome parts of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and fixed in <HI>Holland,</HI> where he chiefly re&s;ided until his return to <HI>Stockholm,</HI> about the year 1739. He here took his doctor's degree in phy&s;ic, in June 1735. How clearly the great <HI>Boerhaave</HI> &s;aw his merit will appear hereafter. On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion he &s;u&s;tained a <HI>the&s;is</HI> under the title of HYPOTHESIS NOVA <HI>de febrium inter|mittentium cau&s;a.</HI> It is an enquiry into the cau&s;es of the frequency of that di&s;temper in <HI>Sweden,</HI> particularly in <HI>Upland,</HI> and the &s;outh-ea&s;t parts of that kingdom; which he was inclined to attribute to a <HI>local</HI> cau&s;e, after the mo&s;t minute &s;crutiny into the &s;oil and &s;ituation of tho&s;e places where this di&s;temper was &s;o remarkably prevalent and
<PB N="11" REF="16">
ob&s;tinate; and finally propo&s;es, Whether it might not be owing to the &s;trong impreg|nation of the water with <HI>argillaceous</HI> particles? Whether or not he afterwards adhered to this opinion, we are uncertain, as it is but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that he did not republi&s;h this tract him&s;elf, &s;ince it was placed at the head of the fir&s;t volume of the <HI>Amaenitates,</HI> printed at <HI>Ley|den,</HI> as we believe, without his knowledge, by Dr. <HI>Peter Camper.</HI> In the mean time we may ob&s;erve, that how&s;oever in&s;ufficient this <HI>hypothe&s;is</HI> may be to &s;olve the difficulties that have at|tended the &s;earch into the remote cau&s;es of this di&s;ea&s;e; the advocates of the modern theory, re|lating to it, may think the author's facts, of its frequency in <HI>low</HI> &s;ituations, confirm and illu&s;trate in no &s;mall degree their own, according to which it is imputed to <HI>mia&s;mata</HI> ari&s;ing from moi&s;t and mar&s;hy ground.</P>
<P>In this year LINNAEUS al&s;o publi&s;hed the fir&s;t &s;ketch of his <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae,</HI> in a very com|pendious way, and in the form of tables only, in twelve pages <HI>in folio.</HI> By this it appears, that he had at a very early period of his life (cer|tainly before he was 24 years old) laid the ba&s;is of that great &s;tructure which he afterwards rai&s;ed, not only to the increa&s;e of his own fame, but to that of natural &s;cience.</P>
<P>In 1736, LINNAEUS came into <HI>England,</HI> and vi|&s;ited Dr. <HI>Dillenius,</HI> the late learned profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Oxford,</HI> whom he ju&s;tly con&s;idered as one of the fir&s;t botani&s;ts in <HI>Europe.</HI> He mentions with par|ticular re&s;pect the civilities he received from him,
<PB N="12" REF="17">
and the privileges he gave him of in&s;pecting his own, and the <HI>Sherardian</HI> collections of plants. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay, that he vi&s;ited Dr. <HI>Martyn,</HI> Mr. <HI>Rand,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Miller,</HI> and that he was in a more &s;ingular manner indebted to the friend&s;hip of Dr. <HI>I&s;aac Law&s;on.</HI> He al&s;o <Q REND="margQuotes">contracted an intimate friend&s;hip with Mr. PETER COLLINSON, which was reciprocally increa&s;ed by a multitude of good offices, and continued to the la&s;t without any diminution.</Q> Dr. <HI>Boerhaave</HI> had furni&s;hed him with letters to our great naturali&s;t Sir HANS SLOANE; but, it is with regret that we mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, they did not procure him the reception which the warmth of his recommendation &s;eemed to claim.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Boerhaave</HI>'s letter to Sir <HI>Hans Sloane,</HI> on this occa&s;ion, is pre&s;erved in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, and runs thus&mdash;<Q REND="margQuotes">LINNAEUS, <HI>qui has tibi dabit literas, e&s;t unice dignus te videre, unice dignus a te videri; qui vos videbit &s;imul, videhit hominum par, cui &s;imile vix dabit orbis.</HI></Q>&mdash;This encomium, how&s;oever quaintly expre&s;&s;ed, yet was in &s;ome mea&s;ure pro|phetic of <HI>Linnaeus</HI>'s future fame and greatne&s;s, and proves how intimately <HI>Boerhaave</HI> had penetrated into the genius and abilities of our author; and, &s;trained as this parallel might be thought, it is likely however that the opening of the <HI>&s;exual</HI> &s;y&s;tem, &s;o different from <HI>Ray's,</HI> by which Sir <HI>Hans Sloane</HI> had always known plants, and particularly the in|novations, as they were then called, which LIN|NAEUS had made in altering the names of &s;o many <HI>genera,</HI> were rather the cau&s;e of that coolne&s;s with which he was received by our excellent naturali&s;t.
<PB N="13" REF="18">
Probably we have rea&s;on to regret this circum|&s;tance; for otherwi&s;e LINNAEUS might have obtained an e&s;tabli&s;hment in <HI>England,</HI> as it has been thought he wi&s;hed to have done; and doubtle&s;s his op|portunities in this kingdom would have been much more favourable to his de&s;igns, than in tho&s;e arctic regions where he &s;pent the remainder of his days. In the mean time, we may ju&s;tly infer the exalted idea that <HI>Linnaeus</HI> had of <HI>England,</HI> as a land eminently favourable to the improvement of &s;cience, from that compliment which, in a letter to a friend, he after|wards paid to <HI>London,</HI> when, &s;peaking of that city, he called it <HI>"Punctum &s;aliens in vitello orbis."</HI> However, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> naturali&s;ts may now con|gratulate them&s;elves on having adopted a mo&s;t excellent di&s;ciple of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;chool; who, with an illu&s;trious a&s;&s;ociate, &s;hared the perils of a navigation round this globe, incited by thir&s;t of knowledge alone; and who now enjoys that general e&s;teem among us which is due to his exten&s;ive &s;cience, and to his &s;ingular liberality of mind and manners.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t agreeable circum&s;tances that happened to LINNAEUS, during his re&s;idence in <HI>Holland,</HI> aro&s;e from the patronage of Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> in who&s;e hou&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The country &s;eat and garden of Mr. <HI>Clifford</HI> was at <HI>Hartcamp,</HI> about three miles from <HI>Haerlem.</HI></NOTE>he lived a con&s;iderable part of his time, being now as it were the child of fortune:&mdash;<HI>Exivi patri&acirc; triginta &s;ex nummis aureis dives</HI>&mdash;are his own words. With Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="19">
however, he enjoyed plea&s;ures and privileges &s;carcely at that time to be met with el&s;ewhere in the world; that of a garden excellently &s;tored with the fine&s;t exotics, and a library furni&s;hed with almo&s;t every botanic author of note. How happy he found him&s;elf in this &s;ituation, tho&s;e only who have felt the &s;ame kind of ardour can conceive.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t in <HI>Holland,</HI> our author was recom|mended by <HI>Boerhaave</HI> to fill the place, then va|cant, of phy&s;ician to the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ettlement at <HI>Suri|nam;</HI> but he declined it, on account of his hav|ing been educated in &s;o oppo&s;ite a climate. He recommended, however, to that department a young German phy&s;ician of great merit, who had the misfortune to fall a &s;acrifice, partly to the climate, and partly perhaps to ill u&s;age from the governor, in half a year after his arrival: A circum&s;tance which LINNAEUS has very pathe|tically lamented in the <HI>Flora Suecica,</HI> N^o 515, when treating of a plant to which he has given this gentleman's name.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides being favoured with the particular patronage and friend&s;hip of <HI>Boerhaave</HI> and Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> as is above-mentioned, our author had al&s;o the plea&s;ure of being contemporary with, and of reckoning among the number of his friends, many other learned per&s;ons, who have &s;ince proved orna|ments to their profe&s;&s;ion, and who&s;e merit has mo&s;t de&s;ervedly rai&s;ed them to fame and honour. Among the&s;e we may properly mention Dr. <HI>John Burman,</HI> profe&s;&s;or of botany at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> who&s;e name and family are well known in the republic of
<PB N="15" REF="20">
letters, to whom our author dedicated his <HI>Biblio|theca Botanica,</HI> having been greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted in com|piling that work, by the free acce&s;s he had to that gentleman's excellent library; <HI>John Frederick Grono|vius,</HI> of <HI>Leyden,</HI> editor of <HI>Clayton's Flora Virginica,</HI> and who very early adopted <HI>Linnaeus</HI>'s &s;y&s;tem; Baron <HI>Van Swieten,</HI> late phy&s;ician to the Empre&s;s Queen; <HI>I&s;aac Law&s;on,</HI> before-mentioned, after|wards one of the phy&s;icians to the Briti&s;h army, who died much regretted at <HI>Oo&s;terhout,</HI> in the year 1747, and from whom <HI>Linnaeus</HI> received &s;ingular and very important civilities; <HI>Kramer,</HI> &s;ince well known for an excellent treati&s;e on the Doci|ma&s;tic Art; <HI>Van Royen,</HI> botanic profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Leyden; Li&euml;berkun,</HI> of <HI>Berlin,</HI> famous for his &s;kill in micro&s;copical in&s;truments and experiments. On this occa&s;ion it is not foreign to our plan to remark, that LINNAEUS, being pre&s;ent with &s;everal of the&s;e gentlemen, at a meeting when the latter was exhibiting the animalcules <HI>in &s;emine ma&s;culino,</HI> openly declared his opinion, that the&s;e <HI>moleculae</HI> were not true animalcules; and he appears ever afterwards to have retained the &s;ame opinion re|lating to them. To the&s;e may be added al&s;o the names of <HI>Albinus</HI> and <HI>Gaubius,</HI> and of others, were it requi&s;ite, to &s;hew that our author's talents had very early rendered him con&s;picuous, and gained him the regard of all tho&s;e who cultivated and patronized any branch of medical &s;cience; and to which, doubtle&s;s, the &s;ingular notice with which <HI>Boerhaave</HI> honoured him, did not a little contri|bute.</P>
<P>Early in the year 1738, after LINNAEUS had left
<PB N="16" REF="21">
Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, when he re|&s;ided with <HI>Van Royen,</HI> at <HI>Leyden,</HI> he had a long and dangerous fit of &s;ickne&s;s; and upon his re|covery, went to <HI>Paris,</HI> where he was properly entertained by the <HI>Ju&s;&s;ieu's,</HI> at that time the fir&s;t botani&s;ts in <HI>France.</HI> The opportunity this gave him of in&s;pecting the Herbaria of <HI>Surian</HI> and <HI>Tour|nefort,</HI> and tho&s;e of the above-named gentlemen, afforded him great &s;atisfaction. He had intended to have gone from thence into <HI>Germany,</HI> to vi&s;it <HI>Ludwig,</HI> and the celebrated HALLER, with whom he was in clo&s;e corre&s;pondence; but he was not able to compleat this part of his intended route, and was obliged to return without this gratification.</P>
<P>Our author did not fail to avail him&s;elf of every advantage, that acce&s;s to the &s;everal mu&s;eums of this country afforded him, in every branch of natural hi&s;tory; and the number and importance of his publications, during this ab&s;ence from his native country, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate that fund of knowledge which he mu&s;t have imbibed before, and no le&s;s te&s;tify his extraordinary application. As the&s;e works laid the foundation of his future fame, and di&s;tingui&s;hed character, it will be incum|bent on us to enumerate them, and give a brief account of each, as nearly as we can in the order of time in which they were publi&s;hed, before we accompany our author into <HI>Sweden;</HI> whither he returned to receive at length the reward of his merit.</P>

<P>Subjoined to the la&s;t edition, we have a biogra|phical table, exhibiting, in chronological order, the names of 139 botanic authors, from the time of <HI>Avicenna</HI> in 981, to Mr. <HI>Cate&s;by</HI> in 1749, &s;pecifying, wherever it was po&s;&s;ible, the year of their birth and death.</P>
<P>The flowering of the <HI>Plantain</HI> or <HI>Banana (Mu&s;a paradi&s;iaca)</HI> this year, a thing not &s;een in <HI>Europe</HI> before more than thrice, in the garden of our au|thor's patron M. <HI>Clifford,</HI> produced a compleat hi&s;|tory of that plant from LINNAEUS'S pen, under the title of MUSA CLIFFORTIANA <HI>florens Hartecampi</HI> 1736 <HI>prope Harlemum.</HI> Lugd.

printed at the end of the <HI>Sy&s;tema,</HI> and is a model for <HI>Monographers</HI> in this way. It is embelli&s;hed with two plates, one repre&s;enting the plant at large, the other, the parts of fructification &s;eparately.</P>
<P>GENERA PLANTARUM <HI>eorumque Characteres na|turales &s;ecundum numerum, figuram, &s;itum, et proportio|nem, omnium fructificationis partium.</HI> Lugd. Bat. 1737, 8^o, pp. 384. In this work, which exhibits what LINNAEUS has called the <HI>natural characters</HI> of the <HI>genera</HI> of plants, the <HI>cla&s;&s;es</HI> are e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the <HI>number</HI> or <HI>&s;ituation,</HI> or both conjointly, of the <HI>&s;tamina,</HI> analogically con&s;idered as the male parts; and the <HI>orders</HI> or &s;ubdivi&s;ions of the cla&s;&s;es, upon the <HI>pi&s;tils,</HI> analogous to the female parts: and the <HI>genera</HI> them&s;elves from the agreement of all the parts of fructification compared with each other, as they agree in <HI>number, figure, &s;ituation,</HI> and <HI>pro|portion.</HI> Hence the <HI>Linnaean characters</HI> of plants are applicable to any cla&s;&s;ical method founded on the parts of fructification alone, in which re&s;pect they have the advantage over tho&s;e of all foregoing writers, and will probably &s;tand firm, even al|though the <HI>cla&s;&s;ical</HI> part of the &s;y&s;tem &s;hould be &s;et a&s;ide. This is to be con&s;idered as one of the capital of <HI>Linnaeus</HI>'s works. He tells us, that before the publication of the fir&s;t edition, he had examined the characters of 8000 flowers. Tho&s;e alone who have been accu&s;tomed to examine plants with a &s;cientific view, can judge how arduous this undertaking mu&s;t have been, and how great the application that he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have be&s;towed thereon, and that at an early period of life. Neither can any others &s;ufficiently admire that accuracy with which
<PB N="20" REF="25">
&s;o great a number of flowers <HI>have been</HI> examined and compared, or &s;ee the aptitude of that a&s;&s;em|blage of terms, which were invented by LINNAEUS, to expre&s;s the different <HI>figure, &s;ituation,</HI> and <HI>pro|portion,</HI> that exi&s;t in &s;uch a variety of &s;ubjects. If this was a proper place to expatiate upon this &s;ub|ject, by extending the idea to all that LINNAEUS has done, re&s;pecting every other part of plants, as con&s;idered in their <HI>&s;pecific</HI> di&s;tinctions, it mu&s;t &s;till farther exalt the merit of the author, and place him above all prai&s;e. At the latter end of this work was given the general plan of a &s;y&s;tem invented by LINNAEUS, and founded upon the different <HI>kinds,</HI> and <HI>arrangement,</HI> of the <HI>calix</HI> or cup of the flower, in plants: but this was omitted in the lat|ter editions. Al&s;o a fragment of that <HI>primum et ultimum</HI> in botany, the <HI>natural method.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t edition of this book contained 935 <HI>genera:</HI> the &s;ixth and la&s;t, at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in 1764, hath extended the number to 1239, and the <HI>Manti&s;&s;ae</HI> &s;ince to 1336. It has been thought by &s;ome, that the fir&s;t idea of the <HI>&s;exual</HI> me|thod was received from the writings of <HI>Jungius,</HI> a learned profe&s;&s;or, fir&s;t at <HI>Helm&s;tadt,</HI> and after|wards <HI>rector</HI> of the Gymna&s;ium at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> where he died in 1657, and who&s;e works contain an uncommon di&s;play of original ob&s;ervations on the &s;ubject of plants; and prove him to have been a mo&s;t accurate ob&s;erver of nature. He has not only di&s;criminated with peculiar nicety, the &s;truc|ture, and &s;everal parts of plants, but he hath al&s;o, with equal judgment, &s;hewn the impropriety of many of the old generical and &s;pecifical di&s;tinc|tions,
<PB N="21" REF="26">
and has given rules for forming them anew, that have been of the greate&s;t &s;ervice to his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors in the &s;cience, and of which they have not failed to avail them&s;elves. But <HI>Jungius</HI> did not, however, exhibit any plan, by which it appears that he laid the ba&s;is either of the &s;exual, or any other &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Before the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ame year (1737) our author publi&s;hed the COROLLARIUM GENERUM, <HI>cui accedit</HI> METHODUS SEXUALIS, in 8^o; the for|mer contained only the addition of &s;ixty new genera of plants; all which were taken into the next edition of the foregoing book; and the latter ex|hibits a brief view of the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem, as far as re&s;pects the <HI>cla&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>orders.</HI> Neither would it be of importance to mention a &s;mall piece publi&s;hed in the &s;ame year, during his re&s;idence with Mr. <HI>Clif|ford,</HI> under the title of VIRIDARIUM CLIFFORTIA|NUM, were it not incumbent on us to mention all that came from our author's pen.</P>
<P>In this year, 1737, appeared likewi&s;e the re&s;ult of the <HI>Lapland</HI> expedition, as far, at lea&s;t, as re|lates to the plants of that country; for we are now deprived of the expectation of ever &s;eeing the <HI>Lache&s;is Lapponica,</HI> intended to complete our au|thor's hi&s;tory of this country through all its parts. This volume includes the plants of a tract of country not le&s;s than 100 <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> miles (nearly equal to 600 <HI>Engli&s;h)</HI> in length, and 50 in breadth, under the title of FLORA LAPPONICA, <HI>exhibens Plan|tas per Lapponiam cre&s;centes, &s;ecundum Sy&s;tema &s;exuale, collectas in itinere impen&s;is Societatis regiae Litterariae et Scientiarum Sueciae An.</HI> 1732 <HI>in&s;tituto, additis &s;yno|nymis,</HI>

<P>In this work, moreover, our author has fir&s;t exemplified, what he ever afterwards laboured to bring to its greate&s;t perfection, in all his writings, and particularly in the <HI>Species Plantarum,</HI> a work not publi&s;hed till &s;ixteen years afterwards, <HI>the &s;pe|cific names of plants,</HI> not taken, as had been cu&s;tom|ary with former authors, from the colour of the flower, relative &s;ize of the plant, &s;mell, ta&s;te, place of growth, time of flowering, name of the di&s;|coverer, virtues, u&s;es, duration; none of which are
<PB N="25" REF="30">
&s;ufficiently permanent: but from tho&s;e invariable and e&s;&s;ential parts, which fully and clearly di&s;tin|gui&s;h each &s;pecies under the &s;ame genus, and in the compa&s;s of ten or twelve words convey &s;uch an idea of the plant intended, as will more effec|tually di&s;tingui&s;h it, than the <HI>verbo&s;e de&s;criptions</HI> of many foregoing authors. LINNAEUS has taken in|credible pains with this part of his &s;y&s;tem, which is certainly as difficult as any that leads to the perfection of the &s;cience, &s;ince it depends upon a nice in&s;pection of <HI>every &s;pecies</HI> belonging to each <HI>genus,</HI> and of every <HI>actual variety</HI> belonging to each <HI>&s;pecies.</HI></P>
<P>The plants of <HI>Lapland</HI> are but few, not amount|ing to more than 537 &s;pecies; and in this number are included upwards of an hundred di&s;covered by <HI>Linnaeus</HI> in this journey, not known to be natives of <HI>Sweden</HI> before; and of which &s;ome were non|de&s;cripts: among the former, there &s;eems to be a propriety in mentioning &s;pecially the <HI>Campanula &s;erpyllifolia,</HI> or thyme-leaved Bell-flower, which, as it turned out to be a new <HI>genus,</HI> was appropriated to our author by Dr. <HI>J. Gronovius,</HI> and engraved in this volume by the name of LINNAEA.</P>
<P>No part of LINNAEUS'S writings had given more offence to the contemporary botani&s;ts, than the liberty he had taken in changing the <HI>generic names</HI> of plants, which had nece&s;&s;arily taken place in many in&s;tances, from the rules e&s;tabli&s;hed by the <HI>Fundamenta.</HI> Even DILLENIUS was by no means reconciled to this innovation. LINNAEUS, who had entertained an high opinion of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pro|fe&s;&s;or, having &s;aid of him&mdash;<HI>nullus e&s;t in Anglia qui</HI>

<P>In 1737 was likewi&s;e publi&s;hed the mo&s;t &s;plendid of all our author's writings, the <HI>Hortus Cliffortianus Plantas exhibens quas in Hortis tam vivis quam &s;iccis, Hartecampi in Hollandia, coluit Vir Nob. et Gen. Geor|gius Clifford, J. U. D. reductis varietatibus ad &s;pecies, &s;peciebus ad genera, generibus ad cla&s;&s;es, adjectis locis plantarum natalibus, differentii&s;que &s;pecierum.</HI> Am&s;t. 1737, fol. pp. 501, t. 32. As this book was printed at the expence of Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> it is orna|mented with an elegant fronti&s;piece, and adorned with &s;ome of the fine&s;t engravings of plants that
<PB N="27" REF="32">
are extant, the drawings for which were made with all po&s;&s;ible accuracy by the late Mr. <HI>Ehret.</HI> By the munificence of Mr. <HI>Clifford,</HI> many of the cele|brated botani&s;ts received a pre&s;ent of this book. How rich this garden was in plants, the book will te&s;tify. They are arranged, as in all our author's &s;ucceeding works, in the &s;exual method; the varie|ties are reduced to their &s;everal &s;pecies, the natural places of the plants are particularly noticed, many new <HI>genera,</HI> and <HI>&s;pecies</HI> under former genera, are introduced, with their de&s;criptions at large, and curious ob&s;ervations inter&s;per&s;ed throughout the whole. And, what mu&s;t have been more e&s;peci|ally acceptable to tho&s;e who began to reli&s;h our author's &s;y&s;tem, was, the farther exemplification of his <HI>&s;pecific characters,</HI> which the va&s;t number of plants included in this work nece&s;&s;arily led to. Add to this, that from the copious number of &s;ynonyms, it is almo&s;t a <HI>pinax</HI> of every plant therein mentioned; and on this account, as well as others, will yet retain its value, though &s;uper&s;eded in a great degree by the <HI>Species Plantarum.</HI> To the curious and critical botani&s;t al&s;o it is no &s;mall &s;atisfaction now, to &s;ee in this volume, compared with later works, the progre&s;s of the author's own knowledge, manife&s;t by the removes and altera|tions that better information enabled him to make. In the dedication our author enumerates tho&s;e patrons who have cultivated botanical gar|dens &s;o greatly to the emolument of the &s;cience: he gives a li&s;t of the <HI>Cliffortian</HI> library, and an|nexes two tables, with explanations of all the variety of leaves, according to his new method
<PB N="28" REF="33">
of defining them. This addition was very nece&s;|&s;ary, as the number of plants &s;ynonymed in this volume amounts to near 2,500. We conclude with <HI>Ge&s;ner's</HI> opinion of this work, in a letter to the celebrated <HI>Haller:</HI> <Q REND="margQuotes">Opus &s;ane egregium et acerrimi judicii, nec minoris eruditionis, quo dif|ficulter botanicus carebit.&mdash;Mihi perplacet ab eo in nominibus &s;pecierum notas earum e&s;&s;entiales exhiberi, quod ante vix qui&s;quam botanicus recte prae&s;titit.</Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t book which LINNAEUS publi&s;hed of his own, during his &s;tay in <HI>Holland,</HI> was the CLASSES PLANTARUM, <HI>&s;eu Sy&s;temata Plantarum om|nia a fructificatione de&s;umta, quorum</HI> 16 <HI>univer&s;alia et</HI> 13 <HI>partialia, compendio&s;e propo&s;ita &s;ecundum cla&s;&s;es, ordines et nomina generica, cum clave cuju&s;vis methodi et &s;ynonymis genericis.</HI> Lugd. Bat. 1738, pp. 656. This work is a very large illu&s;tration of the &s;econd part of the <HI>Fundamenta,</HI> from aphori&s;m 53 to 78, and contains a compendious and u&s;eful view of all the &s;y&s;tems of botany, or methods of cla&s;&s;ing plants, both general and partial, from <HI>Cae&s;alpinus,</HI> in 1583, who is con&s;idered as the inventor, to LINNAEUS him&s;elf in 1735. To the generical name in every &s;y&s;tem, he has added that by which it &s;tands in his own, which is a great advantage in the u&s;e of this book. A new edition, with the requi&s;ite additions, would be very acceptable to the public even now. The &s;y&s;tems at large that are di&s;played in this book, are tho&s;e of <HI>Cae&s;al|pinus, Mori&s;on, Ray, Knaut, Herman,</HI> and <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> founded on the fruit: <HI>Rivinus, Ruppius, Ludwig,</HI> and <HI>Knaut,</HI> on the number of petals in the flower: <HI>Tournefort</HI> and <HI>Pontedera,</HI> on the figure of the

&s;ame: and of <HI>Magnol</HI> and LINNAEUS, on the cup of the flower. After the&s;e follow LINNAEUS'S &s;exual &s;y&s;tem, and his fragments of the natural method. We &s;ay nothing of the arrangement of <HI>particular</HI> cla&s;&s;es, &s;uch are the <HI>compo&s;ite</HI> flowers, the <HI>umbelliferous</HI> plants, the <HI>graminaceous,</HI> the <HI>ferns,</HI> &amp;c. A very large index, referring to every <HI>genus</HI> in each &s;y&s;tem, concludes the volume.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS, whil&s;t in <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;u&s;tained a very &s;evere lo&s;s in the premature death of his friend and fellow &s;tudent <HI>Artedi;</HI> with whom, as has been before ob&s;erved, he had contracted the firme&s;t friend&s;hip whil&s;t they re&s;ided at <HI>Up&s;al;</HI> in&s;omuch that they had, in ca&s;e of death, mutually be|queathed to each other their manu&s;cripts and collections in natural hi&s;tory. <HI>Artedi</HI> had been particularly a&s;&s;iduous in arranging anew, and de&s;cribing all &s;uch fi&s;hes as had fallen under his own in&s;pection; and had taken a voyage to <HI>Eng|land</HI> in 1734, to give more perfection to his plan. Our author, after his death, procured, though with &s;ome difficulty, all <HI>Artedi</HI>'s papers, and put the fini&s;hing hand to them, and publi&s;hed them at <HI>Leyden</HI> in 1738, in octavo, under the title of <HI>Petri Artedi, Sueci Medici,</HI> ICHTHYOLOGIA: <HI>&s;ive opera omnia de pi&s;cibus, &s;cilicet Bibliotheca Ichthyo|logica; Philo&s;ophia Ichthyologica; Genera Pi&s;cium; Synonymia Specierum; De&s;criptiones Specierum. Om|nia in hoc genere perfectiora quam antea ulla. Po&s;t|huma vindicavit, recognovit, cooptavit, et edidit, Caro|lus</HI> LINNAEUS. In this work fi&s;hes are arranged in an entire new method, and which our author adopted with little or no variation, and continued
<PB N="30" REF="35">
through all the former editions of his <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> to the tenth; when he removed the <HI>cetaceous</HI> order into the cla&s;s of the <HI>mammalia;</HI> and in&s;tead of re|taining in the remaining orders the di&s;tinctions ari&s;ing from the <HI>bony</HI> or <HI>cartilaginous</HI> texture of the <HI>fins;</HI> he e&s;tabli&s;hed them on the <HI>&s;ituation</HI> of the <HI>ventral fins,</HI> which he con&s;iders as analogous to the feet in other animals, as they are placed either before, underneath, or behind the <HI>pectoral fins.</HI></P>
<P>In this work <HI>Artedi</HI> has exhibited an in&s;tance of genius, labour, and application, that cannot fail to excite the greate&s;t regret at his early death. He has given to <HI>Ichthyology</HI> that degree of perfec|tion, which his friend afterwards extended through all the animal kingdom, and which mu&s;t remain a la&s;ting monument of his abilities. In parti|cular, his de&s;criptions of the indigenous fi&s;hes of <HI>Sweden,</HI> are &s;cientific to a degree that had never before been &s;een; and we cannot &s;ufficiently ad|mire the pains he mu&s;t have taken to extricate the &s;ynonyms from every author on the &s;ubject. <HI>Artedi,</HI> after his return from <HI>England,</HI> was re|tained, at the recommendation of LINNAEUS, by <HI>Seba</HI> of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> to complete that part of his <HI>The&s;aurus</HI> relating to fi&s;hes, and was unfortunately drowned in one of the canals in that city. LIN|NAEUS, in a &s;hort account of the author's life, has lamented his untimely decea&s;e, in a manner which does no le&s;s honour to his friend than to his own feelings.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now accompany our author into <HI>Sweden,</HI> whither he returned about the latter end
<PB N="31" REF="36">
of the year 1738, or the beginning of the next, and &s;ettled as a phy&s;ician at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> where he &s;eems to have met with con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition, and was oppre&s;&s;ed with many difficulties; all of which at length he overcame, and got into ex|ten&s;ive practice; and, &s;oon after his &s;ettlement, married the lady before &s;poken of. By the intere&s;t of Count <HI>Te&s;&s;in,</HI> who was afterwards his great patron, and even procured medals to be &s;truck in honour of him, he obtained the rank of phy&s;ician to the fleet, and a &s;tipend from the citizens for giving lectures in botany. And what at this time e&s;pecially was highly favourable to the advancement of his character and fame, by giving him an opportunity of di&s;playing his abilities, was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Royal Academy of Sciences</HI> at <HI>Stockholm;</HI> of which LIN|NAEUS was con&s;tituted the fir&s;t pre&s;ident, and to which e&s;tabli&s;hment the king granted &s;everal pri|vileges, particularly that of free po&s;tage to all pa|pers directed to the &s;ecretary. By the rules of the academy, the pre&s;ident held his place but three months, at the expiration of which, he made his ORATIO <HI>de memorabilibus in In&s;ectis,</HI> Oct. 3, 1739; in which he endeavours to excite an atten|tion and enquiry into the knowledge of in&s;ects, by di&s;playing the many &s;ingular <HI>phaenomena</HI> that occur in contemplating the nature of tho&s;e animals, and by pointing out, in a variety of in&s;tances, their u&s;efulne&s;s to mankind in particular, and to the economy of nature in general.</P>
<P>During all this time, however, LINNAEUS appears to have had his eye upon the botanic and medical
<PB N="32" REF="37">
chair at <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> at this time occupied by <HI>Rudbeck,</HI> who was far advanced in life. We learn in|deed that he was &s;o intent on pur&s;uing, and per|fecting, his great de&s;igns in the advancement of his favourite &s;tudy of nature, that he had deter|mined, if he failed in procuring the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip at <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> to accept the offer that had been made to him by <HI>Haller,</HI> of filling the botanic chair at <HI>Gottingen.</HI> However, in cour&s;e of time, he obtained his wi&s;h. In the year 1741, upon the re|&s;ignation of <HI>Roberg,</HI> he was con&s;tituted joint pro|fe&s;&s;or of phy&s;ic, and phy&s;ician to the king, with <HI>Ro&s;en,</HI> who had been appointed in the preceding year on the death of <HI>Rudbeck.</HI> The&s;e two col|leagues agreed to divide the medical departments between them; and their choice was confirmed by the univer&s;ity. <HI>Ro&s;en</HI> took anatomy, phy&s;iology, pathology, and the therapeutic part. LINNAEUS, natural hi&s;tory, botany <HI>materia medica,</HI> the dietetic part, and the <HI>diagno&s;is morborum.</HI></P>
<P>During the interval of his removal from <HI>Stock|holm</HI> to <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> in con&s;equence of this appointment, our profe&s;&s;or was deputed by the &s;tates of the kingdom, to make a tour to the i&s;lands of <HI>O&euml;land</HI> and <HI>Gothland,</HI> in the <HI>Baltic,</HI> attended by &s;ix of the pupils, commi&s;&s;ioned to make &s;uch enquiries as might tend to improve agriculture, and arts, in the kingdom; to which the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> nation had for &s;ome time paid a particular attention; awakened, as it were, by the de&s;olating wars of <HI>Charles</HI> the XIIth, to extend their commerce, and cultivate the arts of peace. The re&s;ult of this journey was very &s;ucce&s;sful, and proved fully &s;atisfactory to
<PB N="33" REF="38">
the States, and was afterwards communicated to the public.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS, on his return, entered upon the pro|fe&s;&s;or&s;hip, and pronounced before the univer&s;ity his ORATION <HI>de Peregrinationum intra Patriam nece&s;|&s;itate,</HI> Oct. 17, 1741; in which he forcibly di&s;plays the u&s;efulne&s;s of &s;uch excur&s;ions, by pointing out to the &s;tudents that va&s;t field of objects which their country held out to their cultivation; whether in geography, phy&s;ics, mineralogy, botany, zoology, or economics; and by &s;hewing the benefit that mu&s;t accrue to them&s;elves and their country as re|wards to their diligence. That animated &s;pirit which runs through the whole of this compo&s;ition, renders it one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and in&s;tructive of all our author's productions. That intimate knowledge which LINNAEUS him&s;elf had acquired of his own country by his repeated travels (fraught as he was too with every requi&s;ite for making u&s;e|ful ob&s;ervations) enabled him to point out with the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion the mo&s;t proper objects of inve&s;tigation, in every part of nature; and his love to his country gave a zeal to his wi&s;hes, that &s;hewed him on this occa&s;ion to great advan|tage; not to add, the aid ari&s;ing from that &s;elf|congratulation, which he mu&s;t feel, having ju&s;t gained, by his late appointment, the &s;ummit of his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The ITER OELANDICUM ET GOTLANDICUM, in 8^o, pp. 284, were printed at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in 1745, in the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> language; as was al&s;o the ITER SCANICUM, in 1751, 8^o, pp. 435. We cannot help regretting that the&s;e <HI>Itinera</HI> have not made
<PB N="34" REF="39">
their appearance in the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or &s;ome other language be&s;ides that of <HI>Sweden;</HI> for though, in a country cultivated like ours, many hints, perhaps, might not be drawn from the&s;e volumes, of real importance to agriculture <HI>here;</HI> yet they are &s;o replete with curious and philo&s;ophical ob&s;erva|tions, that they could not fail to be an acceptable pre&s;ent to the public; as the general &s;cope of the&s;e volumes is to adapt natural hi&s;tory to eco|nomical purpo&s;es. In the <HI>Iter Gothlandicum et Oelandicum,</HI> LINNAEUS'S in&s;tructions were di|rected principally to the&s;e particulars:&mdash;He was to endeavour to find &s;ome kind of earth proper for making pottery-ware in imitation of the porcelaine of <HI>China:</HI> he was to notice every production of nature that might &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of the importation of any article, u&s;ed either in phy&s;ic or manufactures: and in fine, he was to have a regard to every part of natural hi&s;tory. In the execution of his plan, however, he went much farther than his commi&s;|&s;ion extended, having inter&s;per&s;ed a number of ob&s;ervations relating to the antiquities of the&s;e i&s;lands, the mechanic arts, to the manners of the people, their fi&s;hery, and various other articles. He was, as might rea&s;onably be expected, un|&s;ucce&s;sful in the fir&s;t part of his commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ince the two i&s;lands are almo&s;t entirely com|po&s;ed of lime&s;tone, or coral rocks, which abound in a remarkable degree in the <HI>Baltic.</HI></P>
<P>As a proof of the little attention that had been paid to natural hi&s;tory in <HI>Sweden,</HI> we may ob&s;erve,
<PB N="35" REF="40">
that our author in this journey di&s;covered above an hundred plants, which before were not known to be indigenous; many of which were &s;uch as are u&s;ed in phy&s;ic, and in dyeing. He pointed out to the natives &s;everal plants of great u&s;e in ru&s;tic economy, and &s;hewed them the advantage of planting the Sea-reed gra&s;s <HI>(Arundo arenaria)</HI> to arre&s;t the &s;and, and form &s;oil on the &s;hores; to which it is extremely well adapted by the length of the roots. In the ITER OELANDICUM there occurs a curious remark in vegetation, confirming the annual increa&s;e of the wood in an oak-tree, in which was perfectly di&s;tingui&s;hed the hard winters of 1578, 1687, and 1709, by the narrow|ne&s;s of the circles in tho&s;e years. He de&s;cribes the proce&s;s for making tar, as practi&s;ed by the&s;e i&s;landers; and further, inter&s;per&s;es many ob&s;erva|tions relating to mineralogy in general; to iron in particular, with which <HI>Sweden</HI> abounds; de|&s;cribes the iron mountain <HI>Taberg,</HI> (See <HI>Phil. Tran&s;act.</HI> vol. xlix. p. 30.) the alum mines of <HI>Mockleby;</HI> the <HI>Poma chry&s;tallina,</HI> or <HI>a&euml;tites marmo|reus,</HI> which illu&s;trates the formation of chry&s;|tals, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the ITER SCANICUM, performed in 1749, our author treats largely on the culture of mar&s;hy grounds; on the u&s;eful and noxious herbs, for in&s;tance, the <HI>Stakan,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Phellan|drium aquaticum,</HI> or <HI>Water Hemlock,</HI> which it is believed renders hor&s;es that eat it paralytic; on the <HI>Gramen Mannae,</HI> or <HI>Fe&s;tuca fluitans,</HI> the &s;eeds of which are &s;o particularly u&s;eful in fattening gee&s;e; on the <HI>Agaricus mu&s;carius,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

In &s;olving the difficul|ties attending the latter part of the hypothe&s;is, he is led by his &s;ubject to enter largely into a part of the economy of nature, which renders his di&s;|cour&s;e highly intere&s;ting, independently of ali con|jectures relating to the main argument: this re|lates to the various ways in which vegetables are di&s;&s;eminated, and by which they find their way to every part of the globe. To this effect winds, rain, rivers, the &s;ea, animals, &amp;c. are all &s;ub&s;er|vient, as well as the various &s;tructure and pro|perties of the &s;eeds them&s;elves; in illu&s;trating which la&s;t affair the profe&s;&s;or has taken great pains, and con&s;tructed tables of the genera, founded on the&s;e different properties of the &s;eeds. In the introduction to this oration, our author turns the
<PB N="37" REF="42">
attention of his readers to &s;ome of the more re|markable di&s;coveries that had lately been made in natural hi&s;tory and philo&s;ophy; &s;uch were tho&s;e relating to the <HI>Polype, Rattle&s;nake,</HI> and the <HI>Senega,</HI> &amp;c.; among others al&s;o, he mentions a remarkable fact that had been communicated by <HI>Sauvages</HI> of <HI>Montpelier,</HI> re&s;pecting the effect of the berries of the <HI>Coriaria myrtifolia,</HI> Spec. pl. 1467 (Myrtle-leaved Sumach) in occa&s;ioning in&s;tant epilep&s;y.</P>
<P>The three orations of LINNAEUS are &s;ubjoined to the &s;econd volume of the <HI>Amoenitates Academicae,</HI> printed in 1752.</P>
<P>In 1745, the profe&s;&s;or publi&s;hed his FLORA SUECICA <HI>exhibens Plantas per Regnum Sueciae cre&s;|centes, &s;y&s;tematice cum differentiis &s;pecierum, &s;ynonymis autorum, nominibus incolarum, &s;olo locorum, u&s;u Pharmacopoeorum,</HI> 8^o, Holm. pp. 392, 1745; and again, with many additions, in 1755, pp. 464. The fir&s;t edition contains 1140 plants. In the &s;econd they are increa&s;ed, by his own, and the di&s;coveries of his pupils, to 1296. No generical characters are introduced into this work, but re|ferences made to them as they &s;tand in the <HI>Genera Plantarum,</HI> before &s;poken of. A number of &s;elect <HI>&s;ynonyma</HI> is added to his own &s;pecific name, under each plant; and not only the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> names in general, but the <HI>provincial</HI> ones: highly worthy this of imitation in works of this kind, and quite ne|ce&s;&s;ary in &s;o exten&s;ive a kingdom. Many of the rare plants are de&s;cribed at large, and botanical critici&s;ms added to many others. In the la&s;t edi|tion the author has inter&s;per&s;ed a great number
<PB N="38" REF="43">
of curious ob&s;ervations relating to the economical and medical u&s;es of the plants; and has particu|larly noted tho&s;e that are capable of being ap|plied to the purpo&s;es of dyeing. The author moreover never fails to mention <HI>eupori&s;tic</HI> medi|cines, which he &s;eems to think, perhaps very ju&s;tly, have not been attended to by phy&s;icians as they de&s;erve. The plan of this work has been a pattern for all &s;ucceeding writers of <HI>local</HI> cata|logues, more e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have followed the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;y&s;tem, and has been very little im|proved by any; perhaps excelled by none. The plants of <HI>Lapland</HI> are all included in this work; and the preface, be&s;ides the account of <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> authors on botany, contains a curious divi&s;ion of the &s;everal provinces of the kingdom, in re&s;pect to their different &s;oils and &s;ituation, as adapted to particular plants, &s;pecifying under each pro|vince the plants found therein.</P>
<P>In 1746 appeared the FAUNA SUECICA, <HI>&s;i&s;tens Animalia Sueciae Regni: Mammalia, Aves, Amphi|bia, Pi&s;ces, In&s;ecta, Vermes; di&s;tributa per cla&s;&s;es et ordines, genera et &s;pecies, &amp;c. Stockholm</HI> 1746, 8^o; and again, greatly augmented, in 1761, pp. 556. The fir&s;t edition contained 1350 &s;ubjects, the latter comprehends not le&s;s than 2266. Neither in this work are any <HI>cla&s;&s;ical, ordinal,</HI> or <HI>generical</HI> notes given at large. The world had never &s;een &s;o compendious, and it may be truly &s;aid, at the &s;ame time, &s;o complete a <HI>zoology</HI> before. Here, as in plants, the author has given to each animal a new &s;pecific name, expre&s;&s;ive, as far as po&s;&s;ible, of its e&s;&s;ential character. The <HI>&s;ynonyms</HI> are added,
<PB N="39" REF="44">
or referred to, from almo&s;t every author on the &s;ubject, and almo&s;t every animal is moreover com|pendiou&s;ly de&s;cribed. <HI>In&s;ects</HI> make a very con&s;i|derable part of this catalogue; near 1700 &s;pecies, all found in that kingdom, are enumerated, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, and methodized, in a manner entirely new, and which has been adopted by nearly every writer on the &s;ubject &s;ince. We &s;hall &s;peak more fully of the cla&s;&s;ification in the ab&s;tract intended to be given of the <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae.</HI> A compendious manual of <HI>Engli&s;h Zoology</HI> on this plan, is a work much wanted; though we think it could not fail to enhance its value, if the tables of the genera were prefixed to each cla&s;s, and the characters to each genus, as in the <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of our author. Two plates, of &s;ome of the rarer birds chiefly, accom|pany this volume, on which are explained the technical terms u&s;ed in <HI>ornithology.</HI> The number of each cla&s;s of animals &s;tands thus:

<P>An accident having thrown into the hands of the profe&s;&s;or an <HI>Herbarium,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of five large volumes of plants, he di&s;covered that it was the collection of the famous Dr. <HI>Paul Herman,</HI> which had been made in the i&s;land of <HI>Zeylon,</HI> by that gentleman, at the expence of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ea&s;t India Company. This <HI>Herbarium</HI> had been lo&s;t for up|wards of half a century, until chance threw it into the hands of M. <HI>Gunther,</HI> apothecary to the king of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who &s;ent it to LINNAEUS, re|que&s;ting
<PB N="40" REF="45">
the profe&s;&s;or to examine it, and affix the names to the plants of this &s;uperb collection. Its great value, as being collected by &s;o eminent a man, induced our author to examine the whole with great attention; and he was thereby enabled to form many new <HI>genera,</HI> and &s;ettle many doubt|ful &s;pecies. He publi&s;hed the re&s;ult of his la|bour under the title of FLORA ZEYLANICA, <HI>&s;i&s;tens Plantas indicas Zeylonae In&s;ulae, quae olim</HI> 1670&mdash;1677 <HI>lectae fuere, &agrave; Paulo Hermanno Profe&s;&s;ore Botan. Ley|den&s;i; demum po&s;t</HI> 70 <HI>annos ab A. Gunthero orbi redditae.</HI> Holm. 1747, 8^o, pp. 254, tab. 4.</P>
<P>This work is yet of u&s;e as a <HI>pinax</HI> of the&s;e plants, and as a <HI>Linnaean</HI> catalogue of <HI>Burman</HI>'s <HI>The&s;aurus Zeylanicus,</HI> publi&s;hed in 1738, and illu&s;|trated with the figures of upwards of 200 of the&s;e plants. Many of the rare &s;pecies are de&s;cribed, and a very copious number of &s;ynonyms added to &s;everal of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indian</HI> plants. The <HI>Her|barium</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of about 660 plants, of which the true places in the &s;y&s;tem are a&s;&s;igned to up|wards of 400, and the remainder were too im|perfect to admit of di&s;tinction. This volume is rendered valuable by a conci&s;e hi&s;tory of the pro|gre&s;s of botany, from the re&s;toration of learning in the 16th century; a natural hi&s;tory of the i&s;land, and its general produce; the life of Dr. <HI>Herman;</HI> a &s;hort account of <HI>J. Hartog,</HI> who was &s;ent by Dr. <HI>Sherard</HI> to make collections in this i&s;land; and of <HI>Burman</HI>'s <HI>The&s;aurus Zeylanicus.</HI> LINNAEUS authenticates this <HI>Herbarium</HI> to have been <HI>Herman</HI>'s, by &s;hewing that the numbers, and
<PB N="41" REF="46">
the plants, an&s;wer to his <HI>Mu&s;eum Zeylanicum,</HI> pub|li&s;hed in 1717.</P>
<P>We now &s;ee LINNAEUS fixed in the &s;ituation that was &s;o well adapted to his character, his ta&s;te, and abilities, and which &s;eems to have been the object of his ambition, and center of his hopes. Soon after his e&s;tabli&s;hment, he laboured to get the Academical Garden, which had been founded in 1657, put on a better footing, and very &s;oon effected it; procuring al&s;o a hou&s;e to be built for the re&s;idence of the profe&s;&s;or. The whole had been in ruin ever &s;ince the fire in 1702, and at the time <HI>Linnaeus</HI> was appointed profe&s;&s;or of botany, the garden did not contain above 50 plants that were exotic. His corre&s;pondence with the fir&s;t botani&s;ts in <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;oon &s;upplied him with great variety. He received <HI>Indian</HI> plants from <HI>Ju&s;&s;ieu</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> and from <HI>Van Royen</HI> of <HI>Leyden; European</HI> plants from <HI>Haller</HI> and <HI>Ludwig; American</HI> plants from the late Mr. <HI>Collin&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cate&s;by,</HI> and others; and variety of annuals from <HI>Dillenius:</HI> in &s;hort, how much the garden owed to his diligence and care, in a few years, may be &s;een by the catalogue publi&s;hed under the title of HORTUS UPSALIENSIS <HI>exhibens Plantas exoticas horto Up&s;alien&s;is Academiae a &s;e&s;e</HI> (Linnaeo) <HI>illatas ab anno</HI> 1742, <HI>in annum</HI> 1748, <HI>additis, differentiis &s;ynonymis, habitationibus, ho&s;pitiis, rariorumque de&s;criptionibus, in gratiam &s;tudio&s;ae ju|ventutis.</HI> Holm. 1748, 8^o, pp. 306, tab. 3. By this catalogue it appears that the profe&s;&s;or had introduced 1100 &s;pecies, exclu&s;ive of all the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> plants, and of varieties; which latter, in ordinary gardens, amount not unfrequently
<PB N="42" REF="47">
to one third of the whole number. The preface contains a curious hi&s;tory of the cli|mate at <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> and the progre&s;s of the &s;ea&s;ons through the whole year. From the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions we learn, that the greate&s;t degree of heat, in the &s;ummer of 1747, at <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> was on the &s;econd day of <HI>July,</HI> when <HI>Cel&s;ius</HI>'s thermometer &s;tood at 30 degrees above 0; that the greate&s;t degree of cold, on the 25th of <HI>January</HI> 1740, was 28 de|grees below 0. In this thermometer the freezing point is 0, and boiling water 100. From &s;even years ob&s;ervations on the <HI>leafing</HI> of the oak, it was found never to pu&s;h before the 6th of <HI>May,</HI> or to be retarded beyond the 22d.</P>
<P>About this period it was, that LINNAEUS made a remarkable di&s;covery, relating to the generation of pearls in the <HI>river Pearl-Mu&s;cle</HI> (Mya Margaritifera, Sy&s;t. 1112.) This &s;hell-fi&s;h mu&s;t not be confounded with what is called the <HI>Mother of Pearl Shell,</HI> as that belongs to another genus, is a &s;ea-&s;hell, and an inhabitant of the warmer countries only. The &s;hell-fi&s;h in que&s;tion is found in <HI>rivers,</HI> in all the northern parts of the world; in <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> it abounds; it is found in the rivers of the county of <HI>Tyrone</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in tho&s;e of <HI>Done|gall;</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the <HI>Don</HI> is &s;aid to abound with it; and it is not unfrequent in the rivers of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> This fi&s;h will bear removal remarkably well; and it is &s;aid, that in &s;ome places they form re&s;ervoirs for the purpo&s;e of keeping it, and taking out the pearl, which, in a certain period of time, will be again renewed. From ob&s;erva|tions on the growth of the&s;e &s;hells, and the num|ber
<PB N="43" REF="48">
of their annular <HI>laminae,</HI> or &s;cales, it is &s;up|po&s;ed the fi&s;h will attain a very great age; 50 or 60 years are imagined to be a moderate computation. The di&s;covery turned on a method, which LIN|NAEUS found, of putting the&s;e mu&s;cles into a &s;tate of producing pearls at his plea&s;ure; though the final effect did not take place for &s;everal years: he &s;ays, that in 5 or 6 years after the operation the pearl would have acquired the &s;ize of a <HI>Vetch.</HI> We are unacquainted with the means by which he accompli&s;hed this extraordinary ope|ration, but it was probably publi&s;hed at the time, and con&s;idered as important, &s;ince it is cer|tain that the author was rewarded with a munifi|cent <HI>praemium,</HI> from the States of the kingdom, on this account. We regret that we cannot &s;peak more fully on this head; but may ob|&s;erve, that it is probable, from a paper publi&s;hed many years afterwards in the <HI>Berlin</HI> Acts, that the method con&s;i&s;ted in injuring the &s;hell externally, perhaps by a perforation; as it has been ob&s;erved, that the&s;e concretions in &s;hell-fi&s;h are found on the in&s;ide, exactly oppo&s;ite to perforations and injuries made from without by <HI>&s;erpulae,</HI> and other animals.</P>
<P>From the time that LINNAEUS and <HI>Ro&s;en</HI> were appointed profe&s;&s;ors at <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> it &s;hould &s;eem that the credit of that univer&s;ity, as a &s;chool of phy&s;ic, had been increa&s;ing; and the fact in|deed is certain, that numbers of &s;tudents re|&s;orted thither from <HI>Germany,</HI> attracted by the character of the&s;e two able men: and certainly in <HI>Sweden</HI> it&s;elf, many young men were invited to
<PB N="44" REF="49">
the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, by the excellent manner in which it was taught, who otherwi&s;e would have engaged in different pur&s;uits. We mu&s;t not deviate into the line of <HI>Ro&s;en</HI>'s department: &s;uf|fice it to &s;ay, that the&s;e two eminent men, by their united zeal and abilities, failed not to exalt, together with their own fame, that of their uni|ver&s;ity. LINNAEUS, in teaching the <HI>diagno&s;is mor|borum,</HI> had adopted the plan, with &s;ome alteration, of M. <HI>Sauvages</HI>'s No&s;ology, of which we &s;hall be led to give &s;ome account hereafter. In the year 1749, he publi&s;hed, for the u&s;e of his &s;tudents, MATERIA MEDICA, <HI>Liber I. de Plantis dige&s;tus &s;ecundum genera, loca, nomina, qualitates, vires, dif|ferentias, durationes, &s;implicia, modos, u&s;us, &s;ynony|ma, culturas, praeparata, potentias, compo&s;ita.</HI> Holm. 1749, 8^o, pp. 252. The compendious method in which this work is executed, and the &s;everal u&s;eful preliminary papers annexed, render it a very u&s;eful and in&s;tructive manual to &s;tudents in medicine. A <HI>materia medica</HI> of the vegetable king|dom, in which every &s;imple was a&s;certained by &s;o able a botani&s;t as LINNAEUS, was a very con|&s;iderable acqui&s;ition to &s;cience. In this volume are arranged 535 &s;ubjects, and &s;everal are for the fir&s;t time reduced to their proper <HI>genera;</HI> &s;uch are the <HI>Ipecacuanha, Pareira brava, Coculi Indici,</HI> and others.

<P>In the year 1749 was publi&s;hed the fir&s;t volume of a collection of <HI>The&s;es</HI> in 8^o, under the title of <HI>Amoenitates Academicae, &s;eu Di&s;&s;ertationes variae, phy|&s;icae, medicae, et botanicae.</HI> This publication has
<PB N="46" REF="51">
been continued, from time to time, to the com|pletion of the &s;eventh volume in the year 1769. <HI>Holm.</HI> The&s;e volumes, as &s;oon as publi&s;hed, were con&s;tantly reprinted in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Hol|land.</HI> As the&s;e academical di&s;&s;ertations were &s;u&s;tained under LINNAEUS in his profe&s;&s;orial character, and were &s;elected by him&s;elf, they have been regarded as of equal authority nearly with his own writings; and many of them do in a particular manner extend and exemplify divers parts of his works, the &s;ubjects having been pointed out by him&s;elf, in many in&s;tances, for that purpo&s;e. For the&s;e rea&s;ons we &s;hall, in the cour&s;e of this volume, give a very brief ac|count of the purport of each di&s;&s;ertation, &s;ince they contain a great variety of curious intelligence on the &s;ubjects of phy&s;ic and natural hi&s;tory, every where dige&s;ted in the mo&s;t &s;cientific ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t LINNAEUS was meditating one of his capital performances, which had long been ex|pected, and greatly wi&s;hed for, he was interrupted by a very long and painful fit of the gout, which left him in a very weak and di&s;pirited &s;tate; and, according to the intelligence that his friends gave of him, nothing was thought to have contributed more to the re&s;toration of his &s;pirits, than the &s;ea&s;onable acqui&s;ition, at this juncture, of a col|lection of rare and unde&s;cribed plants.</P>
<P>Upon the recovery of his health, he publi&s;hed his book; PHILOSOPHIA BOTANICA <HI>in qua expli|cantur fundamenta botanica cum definitionibus partium, exemplis terminorum, ob&s;ervationibus rariorum, ad|jectis</HI>

<P>In 1753, appeared the Profe&s;&s;or's <Q REND="margQuotes"><HI>Opus maximum et aeternum,</HI></Q> the SPECIES PLANTARUM <HI>exhibentes Plantas rite cognitas, ad genera relatas, cum differentiis &s;pecificis, nominibus trivialibus, &s;ynonymis &s;electis, locis natalibus, &s;ecundum &s;y&s;tema &s;exuale di|ge&s;tas.</HI> Tom. II. <HI>Holm.</HI> 8^o, 1753, pp. 1200; and a &s;econd time in 1762, pp. 1684. To give this work its utmo&s;t perfection, had been the author's object for many years, and to this all his other bota|nic productions are in &s;ome mea&s;ure only prepara|tory; e&s;pecially the <HI>local</HI> catalogues; as the rightly a&s;certaining the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> is the great object of all me|thod. In this work <HI>Linnaeus</HI> takes in every plant that had come &s;ufficiently under his <HI>own</HI> in&s;pec|tion; &s;eldom admitting any on the authority of others; and where&s;oever he has done it, the plant is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a proper mark. The plan of this work is, in general, agreeable to that of all his other local catalogues; no other part of the &s;y&s;tem being exemplified except the <HI>&s;pecies:</HI> and as it is entirely botanical, none of the u&s;es of the plants are here introduced. Every plant has its <HI>&s;pecific</HI> name, con&s;tructed according to the rules e&s;tabli&s;hed in the eighth part of the <HI>Philo|&s;ophia Botanica,</HI> with a reference to all, or any of his own works, in which it has been mentioned be|fore;
<PB N="51" REF="56">
and the &s;ynonym is given, if it be different from the pre&s;ent. Then follow the &s;ynonyms of the be&s;t authors, and con&s;tantly, where the plant is at all rare, or newly-di&s;covered, there is a reference to the be&s;t figures. The country in which the plant grows is then added, and frequently a &s;ym|bol, expre&s;&s;ive of its duration, whether annual, biennial, or perennial.</P>
<P>In this work, for the fir&s;t time, the profe&s;&s;or has given to each plant, what he calls a <HI>trivial</HI> name: that is, a &s;ingle epithet, which may be ex|pre&s;&s;ive, as far as po&s;&s;ible, of the <HI>e&s;&s;ential &s;pecific</HI> difference, among the &s;pecies of the genus: this, however, can take place but rarely; in other in|&s;tances it is expre&s;&s;ive of &s;ome, the mo&s;t &s;triking and obvious difference; and not &s;eldom it is a lo|cal term; or the name of the fir&s;t di&s;coverer. The latter method, could it have taken place, would have had the advantage of conveying, &s;omewhat like a chronological hi&s;tory of each plant, and at the &s;ame time perpetuating due credit to the di&s;|coverer. The&s;e <HI>trivial</HI> names are printed in the margin, to catch the eye in&s;tantly, which is a great advantage. The invention of trivial names, the hint of which was probably borrowed from <HI>Rivini,</HI> by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the memory, has much promoted the knowledge of plants, and mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a capital improvement. Their u&s;e in &s;peaking of plants, and forming compendious catalogues, has been acknowledged by every botani&s;t &s;ince the introduction of them.</P>
<P>In the preface the author gives an ample ac|count of the a&s;&s;i&s;tances he received, and of the
<PB N="52" REF="57">
pains he had taken, to bring this work to its pre|&s;ent &s;tate. To this end, he &s;pecifies, the coun|tries he had travelled over; the many botanic gardens he had vi&s;ited; the various excellent <HI>her|baria</HI> that he had examined, in <HI>Sweden, Holland, England,</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> the names of his pupils educated under him, and their various peregrina|tions; from all which he reaped great advantages, as from the&s;e he received various new plants: and, finally, he acknowledges the many liberal communications of &s;eeds and &s;pecimens, &s;ent to him from all parts of the world by the fir&s;t bota|ni&s;ts of the time.</P>
<P>As this work contains all the plants of the known world which had come to <HI>Linnaeus</HI>'s knowledge, or rather in&s;pection; which, at the publication of the&s;e volumes, appear to have amounted to about 7,300 &s;pecies, all varieties excluded, the profe&s;&s;ed botani&s;t has only to regret, that it could not have been extended by the author him&s;elf, to a com|pleat <HI>pinax,</HI> and <HI>hi&s;tory</HI> of every plant therein de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In this year al&s;o LINNAEUS publi&s;hed MUSEUM TESSINIANUM, <HI>opera Ill. Comitis C. G.</HI> TESSIN, <HI>Regis Regnique Senatoris, &amp;c. &amp;c. collectum.</HI> Holm. 1753, fol. pp. 90. tab. 12. This is a de&s;cription of the cabinet of LINNAEUS'S fir&s;t patron and great friend <HI>Count Te&s;&s;in,</HI> at that time preceptor to the Prince Royal, now King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who had &s;pared no expence in collecting a rich mu&s;eum, principally con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ubjects in mineralogy, and particu|cularly abounding in fo&s;&s;ils of the figured or ex|traneous kind.

<P>The fame which our author had now acquired
<PB N="54" REF="59">
by his <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae,</HI> of which a &s;ixth edition, much enlarged, had been publi&s;hed at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in 1748, in 8^o, pp. 232, with eight tables, expla|natory of the cla&s;&s;es and orders; and which was al&s;o republi&s;hed by <HI>Gronovius</HI> at <HI>Leyden;</HI> had brought, as it were, a conflux of every thing rare and valuable in every branch of nature, from all parts of the globe, into <HI>Sweden.</HI> The king and queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> had their &s;eparate collections of rarities; the former at <HI>Ulrick&s;dahl,</HI> as hath ju&s;t been mentioned; the latter, very rich in exotic in&s;ects and &s;hells, procured at a great expence, at the palace of <HI>Drottningholm.</HI> The&s;e our author was employed in arranging and de&s;cribing. Be|&s;ides the&s;e, the <HI>mu&s;eum</HI> of the royal academy of <HI>Up&s;al</HI> had been augmented by a con&s;iderable do|nation from the king, whil&s;t hereditary prince, in 1746; by another, from Count <HI>Gyllenborg,</HI> the year before; by a third, from <HI>M. Grill,</HI> an opulent citizen of <HI>Stockholm.</HI> The contents of the&s;e three collections are given in the fir&s;t volume of the <HI>Amoenitates Academicae.</HI> We mention them here only to &s;hew that LINNAEUS now began to enjoy ample re&s;ources in every branch of natural hi&s;tory at home; be&s;ides that many ingenious men, who had been educated under him, were now di&s;per&s;ed into various quarters of the globe; and that from their letters he received great intelligence and &s;atisfaction. Seeds and &s;pecimens of plants were &s;ent him from <HI>Siberia,</HI> by <HI>Gmelin;</HI> from <HI>America,</HI> by Dr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> and Governor <HI>Coldingham;</HI> from <HI>England,</HI> by Mr. COLLINSON; Mr. <HI>Ellis;</HI> as al&s;o from his friends in <HI>Holland,</HI> and various other parts
<PB N="55" REF="60">
of <HI>Europe.</HI> And thus it will be &s;een, that he be|gan &s;carcely to feel the di&s;advantages of his northern &s;ituation.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now al&s;o begin to &s;ee the profe&s;&s;or in a more elevated rank and &s;ituation in life. His reputation had already procured him ho|nours from almo&s;t all the Royal Societies in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> Into the <HI>Imperial Academy,</HI> he had been very early received, and di&s;tingui&s;hed, according to the cu&s;tom of that in&s;titution, with a cla&s;&s;ic name, having mo&s;t aptly been called DIOSCORIDES <HI>&s;ecun|dus:</HI> and in the year 1753 he received this honour from the Royal Society of <HI>London;</HI> and his own &s;overeign, truly &s;en&s;ible of his merit, and greatly e&s;teeming his character and abilities, favoured him with a mark of his di&s;tinction and regard, by creating him a KNIGHT of the POLAR STAR. It was now no longer <HI>Laudatur et alget.</HI> His emo|luments kept pace with his fame and honours; his practice in his profe&s;&s;ion became lucrative, and we find him &s;oon after po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his country hou&s;e and gardens at <HI>Hammarby,</HI> about five miles from <HI>Up&s;al.</HI> He had moreover received one of the mo&s;t flattering te&s;timonies of the extent and magnitude of his fame, that perhaps was ever &s;hewn to any literary character, the &s;tate of the nation which conferred it, with all its circum&s;tances, duly con&s;idered. This was an invitation to <HI>Ma|drid,</HI> from the king of <HI>Spain,</HI> there to pre&s;ide as a naturali&s;t, with the offer of an annual pen&s;ion for life of 2000 pi&s;toles, letters of nobility, and the perfect free exerci&s;e of his own religion. An offer not readily parallelled in the hi&s;tory of modern
<PB N="56" REF="61">
times! That he did not accept of it is cer|tain, having, after the mo&s;t perfect acknowledg|ments of the &s;ingular honour done him, returned for an&s;wer, <Q REND="margQuotes">that, if he had any merits, they were due to his own country.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1755, the Royal Academy of Sciences at <HI>Stockholm</HI> honoured our profe&s;&s;or with one of the fir&s;t premiums, agreeably to the will of Count <HI>Sparre;</HI> who had decreed two gold medals, of ten ducats value each, to be annually given by the academy, to the authors of &s;uch papers, in the preceding year's <HI>Stockholm</HI> Acts, as &s;hould be ad|judged mo&s;t u&s;eful in promoting agriculture par|ticularly, and all branches of rural oeconomy. This medal bore on one &s;ide, the arms of the Count, with this motto&mdash;<HI>Super&s;tes in Scientiis amor</HI> FREDE|RICI SPARRE.&mdash;LINNAEUS obtained it in con&s;equence of a paper <HI>de Plantis, quae Alpium Suecicarum in|digenae, magno rei oeconomicae et medicae emolumento fieri po&s;&s;int,</HI> and the ultimate intention was to re|commend the&s;e plants, as adapted to culture in <HI>Lapland.</HI> This paper was in&s;erted in the <HI>Stockholm</HI> Acts for 1754. Vol. XV.</P>
<P><HI>LINNAEUS al&s;o obtained the</HI> praemium centum au|reorum, <HI>propo&s;ed by the Imperial Academy of Sciences at</HI> Peter&s;burgh, <HI>for the be&s;t paper written to</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h, <HI>or</HI> di&s;prove, <HI>by</HI> new <HI>arguments, the doc|trine of the &s;exes of plants. On this occa&s;ion the profe&s;&s;or wrote his DISQUISITIO</HI> de quae&s;tione ab Acad. Imper. Scient. Petrop. in annum <HI>1759</HI> pro praemio propo&s;ita: <HI>SEXUM PLANTARUM</HI> argumentis et experi|mentis novis, praeter adhuc jam cognita, vel corroborare vel impugnare, praemi&s;&s;a expo&s;itione hi&s;torica et phy&s;ica

<P>Apart from all foregoing arguments, facts, and experiments, brought in &s;upport of this que&s;tion, the profe&s;&s;or has in this little tract &s;ufficiently proved, by a &s;eries of <HI>new</HI> facts, that the du&s;t of the <HI>Antherae,</HI> analogically called the male parts, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;hed on the <HI>&s;tigma</HI> or female part, in order to render the &s;eed fertile. His theory of vegetation, prefixed to this paper, is explained more at large in the <HI>Prolep&s;is Planta|rum,</HI> printed in the 6th volume of the <HI>Amoenitates.</HI></P>
<P>It was, if po&s;&s;ible, an additional glory to LIN|NAEUS to have merited this premium from the <HI>Peter&s;|burgh</HI> academy; ina&s;much as a profe&s;&s;or of that &s;ociety, a few years before, had with more than common zeal, although with a futility like that of the other antagoni&s;ts of our author, endeavoured to overturn the whole <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;y&s;tem of botany, by attempting to &s;hew that the doctrine of the &s;exes of plants, had no foundation in nature, and was un&s;upported by facts and experiments.</P>
<P>The great character of LINNAEUS, and that of his colleagues, particularly of <HI>Ro&s;en,</HI> in the medical departments, and their united endea|vours, had very con&s;iderably rai&s;ed the credit of the univer&s;ity of <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> as we have before ob|&s;erved. It is certain, that the number of &s;tu|dents are, at this time, nearly double what they are &s;aid to have been in accounts written 30 and
<PB N="58" REF="63">
40 years ago. The emulation excited among the &s;tudents amply rewarded tho&s;e gentlemen for their pains, by the va&s;t harve&s;t of u&s;eful information flowing in, particularly on the &s;ubjects of natural hi&s;tory, from their pupils, now di&s;per&s;ed in every part of the world. Many of the&s;e young men, after being properly grounded in the principles of phy&s;ic, had, with an ardour which nothing but the &s;tronge&s;t love of &s;cience could in&s;pire, volun|tarily undertaken the mo&s;t di&s;tant and perilous voyages, &s;upported by the munificence of parti|cular patrons or &s;ocieties, to gratify their ta&s;te in the pur&s;uits of natural hi&s;tory, and other u&s;eful knowledge. Several of the&s;e young men peri&s;h|ed, from change of climate, or various other cau&s;es, and much of the fruit of their labour was lo&s;t with them. Such was the fate of <HI>Tern&s;tr&ouml;em,</HI> at <HI>Pulicandor,</HI> in 1745; of <HI>Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t,</HI> who went into <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> and died at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> in 1752; of <HI>Loefling,</HI> who died in <HI>Cumana,</HI> in 1756. Of the fir&s;t of the&s;e we have no remains. The papers of <HI>Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t</HI> were redeemed by the queen of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and publi&s;hed by LINNAEUS, under the title of ITER PALAESTINUM, in 1757, in 8^o; and tho&s;e of <HI>Loefling,</HI> under the title of ITER HISPANICUM, in 1758; to each of which is pre|fixed a &s;hort account of the author. We have al&s;o the fruit of <HI>Kalm</HI>'s journey in <HI>N. America,</HI> and of the voyage of <HI>O&s;beck</HI> and <HI>Toren,</HI> who both went chap|lains to <HI>Swedi&s;h Ea&s;t India</HI> &s;hips. The&s;e are here mentioned particularly, as they are all tran&s;lated, and publi&s;hed &s;ince in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language. We yet deplore the more recent fate of <HI>For&s;kal,</HI> and his
<PB N="59" REF="64">
unfortunate a&s;&s;ociates, in <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the more &s;o, &s;ince his po&s;thumous pieces, publi&s;hed at <HI>Copen|hagen</HI> in 1775, are &s;ufficient to convince us, that the fruit of that expedition would have been rich and large, had it not been &s;o unfortunately bla&s;ted.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o &s;everal others, who made le&s;s remote journies for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; &s;uch were <HI>L. Montin,</HI> who vi&s;ited <HI>Lula-Lapmark</HI> in 1749; <HI>M. Koehler,</HI> who travelled into the &s;outhern part of <HI>Italy</HI> in 1752; Dr. SOLANDER, who vi&s;ited <HI>Pitho-Lapmark,</HI> and <HI>Torno-Lapmark,</HI> in 1753, where he made &s;everal di&s;coveries, and brought back divers rare plants, and other &s;ubjects in natural hi&s;tory, which had e&s;caped the diligence of his great ma&s;ter; <HI>D. Rolander,</HI> who vi&s;ited <HI>Surinam</HI> and <HI>St. Eu&s;tatia,</HI> in 1755; <HI>A. R. Martin,</HI> who &s;earched <HI>Greenland</HI> in 1758, as <HI>C. Al&s;tro&euml;mer</HI> did the &s;outhern parts of <HI>Europe</HI> in 1760. We do not mention others, who re-vi&s;ited the i&s;le of <HI>Gothland</HI> in 1752 and 1760, after <HI>Linnaeus</HI>'s own tour into that place.</P>
<P>The travels of the&s;e gentlemen afforded great &s;ources of information, and furni&s;hed ma|terials for our author, that proved very favour|able to the la&s;t editions of his <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae,</HI> and <HI>Species Plantarum:</HI> in&s;omuch, that we &s;hall &s;ee him exemplifying, in a much more perfect and de|tailed manner, his <HI>Sy&s;tem of Nature.</HI></P>
<P>This work, as far as re&s;pected the <HI>vegetable</HI> kingdom, had been &s;eparately and largely exhi|bited, as before mentioned, in the <HI>Genera Plan|tarum,</HI> and the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> given in the &s;everal <HI>Florae</HI> of
<PB N="60" REF="65">
our author, and finally in the <HI>Species Plantarum.</HI> As yet, however, although it had pa&s;&s;ed through nine editions, little more had appeared in the <HI>ani|mal</HI> kingdom than the generical characters, with a &s;ingle &s;pecific name; in&s;omuch that the ninth edition at <HI>Leyden,</HI> in 1756, was contained in a &s;mall octavo of 226 pages. This it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved notwith&s;tanding, was only a republication of the author's &s;ixth edition in 1748. The &s;cheme therefore cannot be con&s;idered as perfected by the author, until the publication of the 10th edition, in 1758, the fir&s;t part of which, relating to the animal kingdom, makes a volume of 821 pages; and the &s;ame part, in the 12th and la&s;t edition, is augmented by the addition of new &s;ubjects to 1327 pages. This work therefore, publi&s;hed in two volumes at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in 1766 and 1767, is to be con&s;idered as having received the author's fini&s;hing hand, as far as po&s;&s;ible, &s;ince he pro|fe&s;&s;es to de&s;cribe only &s;uch <HI>animals</HI> as had fallen under his own in&s;pection, except in &s;ome in&s;tances, where his dependence upon other authority ren|dered it ju&s;tifiable. The title of this enlarged edition runs thus:</P>

<P>This cla&s;s comprehends not only all the animals which we call <HI>Quadrupeds</HI> (the <HI>Lizard</HI> genus, or rather the <HI>reptiles Pedati,</HI> excepted) but al&s;o the <HI>cetaceous</HI> order, or Whales, Cachalots, and Porpe&s;&s;es. This arrangement of Whales with Quadrupeds, which did not take place in the fir&s;t editions of this work, has not been reli&s;hed by &s;ome very re&s;pectable Zoologi&s;ts who wrote be|fore LINNAEUS; but our author thinks him&s;elf fully ju&s;tified on account of the agreement of the&s;e animals in the <HI>&s;tructure of the heart,</HI> in the re&s;piration by means of <HI>lungs,</HI> in their hav|ing <HI>moveable eyelids, ears,</HI> in being <HI>viviparous,</HI> in being furni&s;hed with <HI>teats,</HI> and in other parti|culars, by which they differ &s;o materially from <HI>fi&s;hes,</HI> as to more than balance that &s;ingle agree|ment in living in the &s;ame <HI>element.</HI></P>

&s;ea&s;ons in the year, as is more particularly &s;een in the arctic regions; not to mention that of the &s;exes in almo&s;t all kinds.

It mu&s;t, however, be con|fe&s;&s;ed, that in too many in&s;tances, it is nece&s;&s;ary to tru&s;t entirely to this di&s;tinction, how&s;oever un|&s;table. The form of the <HI>tail,</HI> as it happens to be <HI>even, cuneated,</HI> or <HI>forked,</HI> is an excellent and firm note; in the <HI>Parrot</HI> genus its length, as <HI>&s;horter</HI> or <HI>longer</HI> than the body, is of great &s;ervice. In others, the <HI>colour</HI> of the <HI>beak,</HI> a <HI>naked</HI> or <HI>cre&s;ted head,</HI> con|tribute to form the note of di&s;tinction. And in fine, nature has &s;tamped upon others &s;ome pecu|liarity, which points them out immediately; as, the <HI>receptacle</HI> of the lower mandible, in the <HI>Pelican;</HI> two long <HI>tail-feathers,</HI> in the <HI>Tropic-bird;</HI> the di|rection of the mandibles in the <HI>Cro&s;s-beak,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>This part of the Sy&s;tem contains upwards of 290 &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In the REPTILES order, the &s;pecific characters of the <HI>Te&s;tudo</HI> genus are deduced principally from the difference in the <HI>&s;hells,</HI> and the <HI>feet;</HI> which in the <HI>Turtles</HI> are pinniform, and in the <HI>Tortoi&s;es</HI> di|gitated. In the <HI>Lacerta</HI> genus, from the <HI>tail, head, toes,</HI> and various other parts; and in the <HI>Rana,</HI> from the diver&s;ity in the <HI>make of the body,</HI> and number of the <HI>claws</HI> on the fore or hinder feet.</P>
<P>In the SERPENTES order, the &s;pecific di&s;tinctions have ever been matter of great difficulty with naturali&s;ts, as they were commonly taken from the <HI>colour,</HI> which is &s;ubject to an almo&s;t infinite variation. Hence it has happened that <HI>Seba,</HI> de|pending on the <HI>colours</HI> alone, hath, in the opinion of our author, figured the <HI>Boa Con&s;trictor,</HI> or Gi|gantic Serpent, ten times, as &s;o many di&s;tinct &s;pe|cies; and the <HI>Coluber Naga,</HI> or Hooded Viper, fourteen, LINNAEUS at length di&s;covered a much
<PB N="91" REF="96">
more certain and permanent note, upon which his <HI>&s;pecific</HI> characters are &s;olely founded: it was fir&s;t exemplified in the <HI>Amphibia Gyllenborgiana,</HI> and he has &s;ince retained it in all his works, &s;en&s;ible however that it is yet liable to failure: this ari&s;es from the number of the &s;mall <HI>&s;hields</HI> and <HI>&s;cales,</HI> or <HI>rings</HI> and <HI>rugae</HI> of the belly and tail; and the pro|portion tho&s;e numbers bear to each other in the different &s;pecies: for example, in our <HI>Common Viper</HI> the <HI>&s;hields</HI> of the <HI>belly</HI> are u&s;ually about 146, and the <HI>&s;cales</HI> of the <HI>tail,</HI> that is all below the anus, about 39 or 40: the <HI>&s;hields</HI> in our <HI>Common Snake</HI> about 170, and the <HI>&s;cales</HI> about 60.</P>
<P>In the NANTES the &s;pecific characters are &s;hort, but very various in the different <HI>genera,</HI> as to the parts of the animal from which they are deduced: in the <HI>Petromyzon</HI> and <HI>Raia,</HI> from the <HI>mouth, fins, teeth,</HI> &amp;c.; in the latter very much from the <HI>body</HI> it&s;elf: in the <HI>Squalus,</HI> from a variety of parti|culars: in the <HI>Acipen&s;er,</HI> from the <HI>cirri</HI> or beard, and the <HI>dor&s;al &s;hields,</HI> or <HI>&s;quamae:</HI> in the <HI>Bali&s;tes,</HI> from the fins and tail: in the <HI>O&s;tracion,</HI> from the different <HI>angulated form</HI> of the <HI>body:</HI> in the <HI>Tetrodon,</HI> from differences in the body chiefly; and in the remaining <HI>genera,</HI> from the form of the body, and the differences in the fins.</P>

<P>No part of the &s;y&s;tem of nature has undergone a greater change than this cla&s;s; neither does our author &s;tand more unrivalled, than in the excel|lent arrangement he has given to this branch of natural hi&s;tory; which, before his time, was nearly without method. It comprehends 87 GENERA, di&s;po&s;ed into &s;even <HI>orders,</HI> founded, in mo&s;t of them, on the differences ob&s;ervable in the <HI>number</HI> and <HI>texture</HI> of the <HI>wings.</HI> Our intended brevity will not permit a detail of the <HI>genera,</HI> in the &s;uc|ceeding parts of the &s;y&s;tem; we mu&s;t, therefore, now that we are de&s;cended to the inferior parts of the animal kingdom, only give the definitions of the &s;everal <HI>orders,</HI> with a few ob&s;ervations. The fir&s;t order is called,</P>
<P N="1">I. COLEOPTERA. In&s;ects having the wings co|vered with two cru&s;taceous ca&s;es, divided by a longitudinal &s;uture.</P>
<P>This order is the mo&s;t numerous; it contains almo&s;t all tho&s;e in&s;ects which go under the general name of <HI>Beetles:</HI> and includes upwards of 900 &s;pecies, ranked under 30 genera. Among the&s;e are the Chafers, Stag-beetles, Leather-eaters, Car|rion-beetles, Tortoi&s;e-beetles, Lady-flies, Honey-beetles, Weevils, Mu&s;k-beetles, Glow-worm, Spring-beetles, Water-beetles, Bli&s;ter-beetle, Rove-beetle, Earwig, and &s;everal other <HI>genera.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. HEMIPTERA. Half-winged in&s;ects; having the &s;hells or ca&s;es &s;emi-cru&s;taceous, not divided by
<PB N="102" REF="107">
a &s;traight &s;uture, but incumbent on each other in the margin. The beak curved inwards.</P>
<P>This order contains about 350 &s;pecies, under 12 <HI>genera;</HI> among the&s;e are the Cock-roach, Camel-cricket, Locu&s;ts and Common Crickets, Lan|thorn-fly, Flea-locu&s;t, Boat-fly, &amp;c. Bug, a nu|merous genus; Aphis, or Currant-lou&s;e; Cochi|neal-in&s;ect, and others.</P>
<P N="3">III. LEPIDOPTERA. In&s;ects with four wings, imbricated or cloathed with fine &s;cales or feathers: tongue &s;piral, and coiled up; body hairy.</P>
<P>This order contains only three <HI>genera;</HI> but the &s;pecies are very numerous, nearly 800. The But|terflies, Hawk-moths, and the Moths or <HI>Phalenae.</HI> Of the latter, LINNAEUS enumerates 460 &s;pecies. This being the mo&s;t beautiful tribe of in&s;ects, has been much &s;ought after, and later entomologi&s;ts have con&s;iderably increa&s;ed this number.</P>
<P N="4">IV. NEUROPTERA. In&s;ects with 4 naked, tran&s;|parent, or reticulated wings; tail in mo&s;t kinds without a &s;ting.</P>
<P>Upwards of 80 &s;pecies in 7 <HI>genera;</HI> among the&s;e are the Dragon-fly, May-fly, Spring-fly, Pearl-fly, Scorpion-fly, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">V. HYMENOPTERA, In&s;ects with 4 membra|naceous wings, excepting &s;ome few &s;pecies, which are de&s;titute of wings; females with the tail armed with a &s;ting.</P>
<P>This is a numerous order; it contains 320 in|&s;ects in 10 <HI>genera;</HI> among the&s;e are the Saw-fly or <HI>Tenthredo,</HI> Tailed-wa&s;p, Ichneumon-fly, Ichneu|mon-wa&s;p, Wa&s;p, Bee, Ant, and Golden Wall-fly, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="103" REF="108">
VI. DIPTERA. In&s;ects with two wings; fur|ni&s;hed al&s;o with a balance or club behind each wing.</P>
<P>This order, under 10 <HI>genera,</HI> contains near 270 &s;pecies, among which are the Gad-flies, Gnats, Common Fle&s;h-fly, Wa&s;p-fly, Hor&s;e-fly, Bee-fly, and others.</P>
<P N="7">VII. APTERA. In&s;ects without wings, in either &s;ex.</P>
<P>This order contains 290 &s;pecies under 14 <HI>genera,</HI> and falls ea&s;ily into three divi&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1. With 6 legs: The Sugar-mite, Ground-flea, Death-watch, Lou&s;e, Common Flea.</P>
<P N="2">2. With 8 to 11 legs: The Tick-&s;piders, Scor|pion, Crab, King-crab, and Millepede.</P>
<P N="3">3. With numerous legs: The Centipede and Gallyworm.</P>

<HEAD>Cla&s;s VI. VERMES.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ixth and la&s;t cla&s;s contains the VERMES, which are divided into five orders. LINNAEUS very early adopted the new &s;y&s;tem of <HI>Pey&s;onnel, Ju&s;&s;ieu,</HI> and &s;ome others, in introducing the corals and corallines into the animal kingdom, under the names of LITHOPHYTA and ZOOPHYTA. This &s;y&s;tem has had great light thrown upon it by the late excellent Mr. ELLIS, in his hi&s;tory of Coral|lines, and &s;everal papers printed in the Philo&s;ophi|cal Tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>As this is by far the mo&s;t anomalous of all the cla&s;&s;es, the characters of the orders are very va|rious.</P>
<P N="1">1. INTESTINA. Animals &s;imple, naked, de&s;ti|tute of limbs.</P>
<P>This order includes 7 <HI>genera;</HI> among which are the Guinea-worm, A&s;carides, Earth-worm, Gourd|worm, Leech, &amp;c. It contains but 24 &s;pecies.</P>
<P N="2">II. MOLLUSCA. Animals &s;imple, naked, not in|cluded in a &s;hell, but furni&s;hed with limbs.</P>
<P>This order includes 18 <HI>genera,</HI> containing 110 &s;pecies. Among the&s;e rank the common naked Snail, Sea Hare of <HI>Rondeletius, Doris,</HI> Sea Mou&s;e, <HI>Nereis, A&s;cidia, Actinia,</HI> or Sea Anemone, <HI>Tethys,</HI> Cuttle-fi&s;h, Sea Lungs, or Blubbers, Star-fi&s;h, and <HI>Echinus,</HI> called Sea Hedge-hog, and others.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="105" REF="110">
III. TESTACEA. Animals, generally of the foregoing order, but included in a &s;hell.</P>
<P>This order takes in the whole tribe of &s;hells, con&s;i&s;ting of upwards of 800 &s;pecies, under 36 <HI>genera,</HI> and di&s;po&s;ed in a method entirely new. The three fir&s;t <HI>genera</HI> are the <HI>multivalves,</HI> the next fourteen <HI>bivalves,</HI> and the remainder <HI>univalves.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. LITHOPHYTA. Compo&s;ite animals, affixed to, and fabricating a fixed calcareous ba&s;e, called <HI>Coral.</HI></P>
<P>This order contains 59 &s;pecies, under four <HI>gene|ra:</HI> the <HI>Tubipora,</HI> red tubular Coral; <HI>Madrepores</HI> or Brain Stones; <HI>Millepores;</HI> and another called <HI>Cel|lepore.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. ZOOPHYTA. Animal compo&s;ite, re&s;embling a flower, and &s;pringing from a vegetating &s;tem.</P>
<P>This order contains 14 genera, of which nine are fixed, and the other locomotive: among&s;t the former rank the <HI>I&s;is</HI> or red Coral, Sea Fan, <HI>Al|cyonium,</HI> Sponge, Corallines, &amp;c.: among the latter, the Polype, Sea Pens, <HI>Taenia, Furia,</HI> and la&s;tly the a&s;&s;emblage of chaotic, or micro&s;copi|cal <HI>Animalcula.</HI> The &s;pecies under this order are 156.</P>
<P>The <HI>generical</HI> di&s;tinctions among the INTESTINA ari&s;e from the diver&s;ity of the body of the animal, almo&s;t &s;olely.</P>
<P>In the MOLLUSCA, from the body and feelers, called <HI>tentacula,</HI> and from other parts.</P>
<P>In the TESTACEA, the included animal, the general differences between the &s;hells them&s;elves, but principally the <HI>cardo</HI> or hinge in the bivalves,
<PB N="106" REF="111">
and the <HI>aperture</HI> in the univalves, furni&s;h the ge|neric note.</P>
<P>In the LITHOPHYTA, the inhabitant animal, and the form of the coral it&s;elf: and in the ZOOPHYTA, the animal, and the very different forms of the fabrifications, lay a foundation for the generic notes.</P>
<P>After having thus exhibited a view of the <HI>Cla&s;&s;es,</HI> it remains that we give a general account of the method pur&s;ued in treating on each &s;pecies. To this end it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that throughout the whole <HI>&s;y&s;tem,</HI> the <HI>cla&s;&s;ical</HI> character, that of the <HI>order,</HI> and the <HI>generical</HI> note, always make a part in the de&s;cription of each <HI>&s;pecies.</HI> After the&s;e, our author begins with his own <HI>&s;pecific</HI> name for the animal, e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential difference ob&s;ervable between that and every other &s;pecies of the <HI>genus;</HI> and here it mu&s;t be allowed, that he has, in general, happily &s;uc|ceeded, by giving, in the &s;pace of two or three lines, a di&s;tinction that more immediately points out the animal &s;ought for, than the long and la|boured de&s;criptions of many foregoing authors. If the <HI>&s;pecific</HI> name is the &s;ame that is adopted in any of his former writings, he refers to it. He has, however, in many parts of this enlarged edition, formed new names to animals noticed in the former edition, and in the <HI>Fauna Suecica.</HI> Where indeed the e&s;&s;ential or &s;pecific di&s;tinction is the point in view, this mu&s;t frequently be the ca&s;e, &s;o long as new &s;pecies continue to come in; for, as the e&s;&s;ential character of each <HI>&s;pecies</HI> re&s;ults
<PB N="107" REF="112">
from the mo&s;t careful compari&s;on of the whole <HI>genus,</HI> the introduction of a new one mu&s;t, in many in&s;tances, &s;o cla&s;h with the old, as to re|quire, perhaps, a total alteration in every <HI>&s;pecific</HI> name of the <HI>genus.</HI></P>
<P>After his own &s;pecific name, he gives the <HI>&s;ynonyms,</HI> and page of the mo&s;t reputed and au|thentic writers in each cla&s;s; and particularly re|fers to tho&s;e who have be&s;t figured his &s;ubject; then the <HI>locus natalis,</HI> and in many in&s;tances, more e&s;pecially among the <HI>Mammalia</HI> and <HI>Aves,</HI> a &s;hort but comprehen&s;ive hi&s;tory re&s;pecting the nature, economy, and u&s;es of the animal. To every animal the author has affixed his <HI>trivial</HI> name, expre&s;&s;ive, mo&s;t commonly, of place where it is found, of its colour, form, or &s;ome quality or attribute, de&s;criptive, as far as may be, of the ani|mal; or, in a great variety of ca&s;es, where the &s;ubject has been well known by a &s;ingle term, he retains that as his <HI>trivial</HI> name. To in&s;tance in the Partridge and Quail, which both belong to his <HI>genus</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed under the name <HI>Tetrao:</HI> he therefore calls the former <HI>Tetrao Perdix,</HI> and the latter <HI>Tetrao Coturnix.</HI></P>
<P>It has been objected to LINNAEUS'S cla&s;&s;ification in various parts of his &s;y&s;tem, that he has thrown together &s;ubjects too different in their general appearance and economy, by keeping too clo&s;ely to <HI>one</HI> character; to in&s;tance particularly in the MAMMALIA, by confining him&s;elf to the teeth. To this it may be an&s;wered, in general, that if <HI>only</HI> quadrupeds were to be cla&s;&s;ed, no &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="108" REF="113">
needed to have bee built, as their number is &s;o &s;mall: but when it is recollected, that <HI>all Nature</HI> was under his eye, and that therefore the &s;ubjects were almo&s;t infinite, it became nece&s;&s;ary to form the ba&s;is of every great divi&s;ion or cla&s;s, <HI>as far as po&s;&s;ible, on one &s;imple foundation.</HI> And perhaps it is the ob&s;ervance of this rule that has given LIN|NAEUS'S &s;y&s;tem &s;o greatly the advantage over all foregoing writers. For, as nature does not &s;eem to have ob&s;erved <HI>any</HI> &s;y&s;tem, ours mu&s;t be artificial, and will ever have its anomalies. As an artificial &s;y&s;tem therefore, that mu&s;t have the preference, which will mo&s;t readily lead to the &s;ubject under inve&s;tigation; in which ca&s;e it is of &s;mall im|portance where it is placed, and how far removed from others with which it &s;eems to bear a &s;imilar and general appearance.</P>
<P>We &s;hall clo&s;e this brief view of the arrangement of animals, by exhibiting the number of &s;ubjects enumerated, all of which are &s;ynonymed by the author, in the 12th edition of his <HI>Sy&s;tem.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TOM. II. The VEGETABLE KINGDOM.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;econd part of the <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae,</HI> relating to vegetables, in all the editions prior to the tenth, was very compendiou&s;ly exhibited; the au|thor having, after his <HI>Clavis Cla&s;&s;ium,</HI> only given the names of the <HI>genera,</HI> with their <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> or ab|breviated characters, without touching at all on &s;pecific di&s;tinctions, which were re&s;erved for the pre&s;ent enlarged edition of the Sy&s;tem, and for the SPECIES PLANTARUM, a work before &s;poken of. This volume contains upwards of 560 pages; and in the twelfth edition of 1767, by the acce&s;&s;ion of new materials, is enlarged to 731. It contains, in a mo&s;t compendious manner, a view of the whole vegetable kingdom, as far as the &s;ubjects thereof had come under our author's own in&s;pection, di&s;|po&s;ed according to that &s;y&s;tem of which LINNAEUS had been the inventor, founded, as to the cla&s;&s;ical part, upon the <HI>&s;exes</HI> of plants; a &s;y&s;tem now al|mo&s;t univer&s;ally received. It is in this branch
<PB N="111" REF="116">
of the &s;tudy of nature, that this great naturali&s;t has &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf. From him <HI>botany</HI> boa&s;ts a new <HI>aera;</HI> and HALLER, one of the fir&s;t writers of this age, in the &s;ame line of &s;cience, and who alone might dare to rival him, has, with a liberality of mind becoming a great man, allowed this &s;upe|riority to LINNAEUS.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to a particular account of this part of the &s;y&s;tem, it may not be improper to premi&s;e &s;ome ob&s;ervations on <HI>methods</HI> of <HI>botany</HI> in general, before our author wrote. It is needle&s;s to urge the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>method</HI> in the &s;tudy of na|ture, as it is the very &s;oul of &s;cience; and, amid&s;t &s;uch a multitude of objects which the vegetable kingdom affords, all attempts towards the acqui|&s;ition of knowledge without it, mu&s;t end in un|certainty and confu&s;ion. We have &s;ufficient proofs of this in the writers upon plants before the in|vention of &s;y&s;tems, and &s;ee and deplore the want of them, in the lo&s;s of many valuable articles, not only in the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> but in the <HI>Materia Pictoria,</HI> and <HI>Tinctoria</HI> of the antients. Articles, the virtues and properties of which appear to have been well a&s;certained, are now lo&s;t to us, for want of a more &s;cientific arrangement of the &s;ubjects, and accuracy in the de&s;criptions of them.</P>
<P>Botanic writers cho&s;e very different methods of arranging plants, not only before, but &s;ince, the invention of &s;y&s;tematic botany. The <HI>al|phabetic</HI> has been much followed, e&s;pecially in local catalogues. Some have di&s;po&s;ed the plants according to <HI>the time of flowering;</HI> as <HI>Pauli,</HI> in his
<PB N="112" REF="117">
<HI>Quadripartitum Botanicum,</HI> publi&s;hed in 1639; <HI>Be&s;ter,</HI> in the <HI>Hortus Ey&s;tetten&s;is,</HI> 1640; and <HI>Dil|lenius,</HI> in the <HI>Catalogus Gi&s;&s;en&s;is,</HI> 1719. Others have arranged them according to the <HI>different places of their growth;</HI> as the authors of the <HI>Hi&s;toria Lugdu|nen&s;is,</HI> in 1587: and &s;ome according to their <HI>virtues in medicine.</HI> Others again, ob&s;erving that numbers of vegetables agreed with each other in their general habit and appearance, or had a certain harmony and proportion in the form and di&s;po&s;ition of their roots, leaves, flowers, or fruit; in their particular mode of growing, flowering, or foliation, &s;aw that they naturally fell as it were into cla&s;&s;es, agree|able to &s;uch di&s;tinctions. Hence their divi&s;ion of trees, into <HI>pomiferae, pruniferae, bacciferae, nuciferae, glandiferae,</HI> &amp;c.; of herbs, into <HI>bulbo&s;ae, &s;iliquo&s;ae|umbelliferae, verticillatae, papilionaceae,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e were &s;o many <HI>cla&s;&s;es</HI> or <HI>orders,</HI> which nature had &s;o characterized that they could not e&s;cape their notice; and, could all the &s;ubjects of the vegetable kingdom be <HI>properly reduced</HI> to &s;uch combinations, and the whole chain <HI>properly connected,</HI> we &s;hould then &s;ee what is meant by the NATURAL METHOD, that <HI>ultimum et de&s;ideratum</HI> of botany, of which our author &s;ays, however, <Q REND="margQuotes">Nec &s;perare fas e&s;t, quod no&s;tra Aetas &s;y&s;tema quoddam naturale videre queat, et vix &s;eri nepotes.</Q> Neverthele&s;s the be&s;t writers of the la&s;t century, &s;uch were <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;par Bauhine,</HI> endeavoured to pre&s;erve the above|mentioned arrangement, although it was in a rude manner. In this they were followed by our own countrymen <HI>Gerard</HI> and <HI>Parkin&s;on,</HI> but as
<PB N="113" REF="118">
they e&s;tabli&s;hed no preci&s;e definitions to their cla&s;&s;es, &s;o in their &s;ubdivi&s;ions, or chapters, they paid little or no regard to the minuter parts of di&s;tinction, taken from the fructification; hence, nothing like <HI>generical notes</HI> can be di&s;covered in their methods: &s;o that the only re&s;ource, in find|ing many of their plants, was, to read over their long and tedious de&s;criptions, which, after all, were frequently in&s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h the plant &s;ought for.</P>
<P>That great naturali&s;t <HI>Conrade</HI> GESNER, who died in 1565, in his 50th year, appears to have been the fir&s;t who thought, with any preci&s;ion, of a method of cla&s;&s;ing plants from the <HI>flower,</HI> or <HI>fruit;</HI> but he only &s;lightly touches thereon in his epi&s;tles; he lived not to bring any thing to perfection in this way. It was re&s;erved for <HI>Cae&s;alpinus,</HI> phy&s;ician to Pope <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. to be the fir&s;t author who arranged plants in a true &s;y&s;tematic manner, in his <HI>Libri de Plantis,</HI> publi&s;hed in 1583, in which he e&s;tabli&s;hes the characters principally <HI>from the fruit.</HI> It is wonderful, that after his time, though &s;o many eminent botani&s;ts flouri&s;hed, among whom were the two <HI>Bauhines,</HI> no one ever thought of pur&s;u|ing the plan he laid down, until <HI>Mori&s;on</HI> and <HI>Ray,</HI> who both publi&s;hed, nearly together, their &s;eparate &s;y&s;tems, founded al&s;o upon di&s;|tinctions principally drawn from the fruit. Since their time, others have laboured to bring their &s;y&s;tems to perfection; as <HI>Knaut</HI> in <HI>Germany; Paul Herman,</HI> and <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> in <HI>Holland;</HI> and <HI>Dillenius,</HI> late profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Oxford,</HI> had &s;till far|ther
<PB N="114" REF="119">
perfected Mr. <HI>Ray</HI>'s method, as is evident from the arrangement he has given to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> plants, in the third edition of that author's <HI>Synop&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>Several elegant &s;y&s;tems have al&s;o been formed from the <HI>flower,</HI> as the ba&s;is of the <HI>cla&s;&s;ical</HI> cha|racter; in con&s;idering which, both the <HI>regularity</HI> and <HI>irregularity,</HI> as well as the <HI>number</HI> of the <HI>petals,</HI> have been made the principal di&s;tinction. <HI>Rivini,</HI> at <HI>Leip&s;ic,</HI> in 1690, was the fir&s;t who took the flower as the foundation of his method, as did <HI>Ruppius</HI> in 1718. But no one carried this me|thod to &s;uch perfection as <HI>Tournefort,</HI> in 1694, who forms his <HI>cla&s;&s;ical</HI> character from the <HI>figure</HI> of the <HI>flower,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;hes his <HI>orders</HI> or &s;ubdivi&s;ions on the different <HI>&s;ituation</HI> of <HI>the fruit,</HI> whether above or below the <HI>empalement</HI> or <HI>receptacle.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e methods, in which the authors have con&s;idered one part only, either <HI>flower</HI> or <HI>fruit,</HI> as the ba&s;e of their &s;y&s;tems, &s;everal others have been con&s;tructed of late years, in which ve|getables have been arranged, as far as po&s;&s;ible, according to what have been called the <HI>natural cla&s;&s;es;</HI> the foundations of which take in a nu|merous &s;et of characters, ari&s;ing from a combina|tion and agreement in the <HI>habit</HI> of the plants, as well as their <HI>harmony</HI> in the e&s;&s;ential <HI>parts of fructification.</HI> Among the&s;e, that of <HI>Van Royen,</HI> late profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Leyden,</HI> is among the mo&s;t elegant at|tempts towards this <HI>ultimum</HI> in botany. This is exhibited in the <HI>Prodromus Florae Leyden&s;is,</HI> 1740. He is followed by <HI>Gmelin,</HI> in the <HI>Flora Sibirica,</HI>

1747, &amp;c. The&s;e authors, as al&s;o <HI>L. Gerard,</HI> in his <HI>Flora Gallo&punc;provincialis,</HI> Paris 1761, pre&s;erve the <HI>natural generical characters</HI> of LINNAEUS almo&s;t entire through their &s;y&s;tems; and the latter writer has, with &s;ome variations, taken the <HI>orders</HI> of a <HI>natural method,</HI> con&s;tructed by <HI>B. Ju&s;&s;ieu,</HI> for his <HI>cla&s;&s;es.</HI> HALLER al&s;o planned, and brought to great perfection, a method of this kind, as is exhibited in his <HI>Enumeratio Stirpium Helvetiae,</HI> 1742, and in the <HI>Hortus Gottingen&s;is,</HI> 1753, which he has &s;ince &s;till more elaborated, in a work of infinite labour and merit, the <HI>Hi&s;toria Stirpium Helvetiae,</HI> 3 tom. fol. 1768.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS him&s;elf very early attempted a <HI>na|tural</HI> method; but it is evident he thought there were too many links wanting in the chain, to ren|der it the readie&s;t guide to botanical &s;cience; &s;ince he &s;oon de&s;erted it, although he continued to improve it to the la&s;t: however he only reduced the <HI>genera</HI> into <HI>orders,</HI> but did not venture &s;o far as to form the <HI>cla&s;&s;ical</HI> part of a &s;y&s;tem on that plan. The pre&s;ent learned and indefatigable profe&s;&s;or Dr. HOPE, at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who&s;e zeal and &s;ucce&s;s in cultivating and diffu&s;ing the principles of the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;y&s;tem are well known, has con&s;tructed perhaps the mo&s;t elaborate attempt of this kind that the botani&s;ts have ever &s;een. We join with many others in wi&s;hing that he may be enabled to give it all that perfection which may encourage him to pre&s;ent it to the public.</P>
<P>Methods have al&s;o been formed from the dif|ferent &s;pecies and arrangement of the <HI>calyx,</HI> or cup
<PB N="116" REF="121">
of the flower in plants. Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Magnol,</HI> of <HI>Montpelier,</HI> publi&s;hed in 1720 on this plan; and LINNAEUS him&s;elf in 1737, but he did not pur&s;ue it.</P>
<P>Every method of arrangement hath its advan|tage in &s;ome re&s;pect or other; and it is &s;urely rather to be regretted, how&s;oever the <HI>flower</HI> may claim the preference, that a method founded in the di&s;tinctions of the <HI>fruit,</HI> &s;hould not al&s;o have as it were a &s;econdary place in common u&s;e; for, as all artificial methods are only &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o many <HI>&s;uccedanea</HI> to the <HI>natural</HI> one, a due attention to each might tend to illu&s;trate the natural cla&s;&s;es, to connect them, and reduce the anomalies, and &s;o far pave the way to the accompli&s;hment of that &s;cheme, which, however, will yet by many be con&s;idered as quite impracticable in botany.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS was the fir&s;t who con&s;tituted the <HI>&s;tamina</HI> and <HI>pi&s;tils</HI> as the ba&s;is of an artificial me|thod of arranging plants; and he tells us, in his CLASSES PLANTARUM, he was led to this by con&s;idering the great importance of the&s;e parts in vegetation. They alone are the e&s;&s;entials nece&s;|&s;ary to fructification; all other parts, except the <HI>anthera</HI> and <HI>&s;tigma,</HI> being wanting in &s;ome flowers; and the pre&s;ent philo&s;ophy of botany regards the former as the <HI>male,</HI> and the latter as the <HI>female</HI> organs of generation in plants. As &s;uch indeed they mu&s;t be con&s;idered <HI>analogically,</HI> and in a phi|lo&s;ophical view; yet, perhaps, the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;y&s;tem, admirable as it is, would not have been le&s;s ac|ceptable had the cla&s;&s;ical terms been expre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="117" REF="122">
only of <HI>number</HI> and <HI>&s;ituation,</HI> without regard to the offices of the parts in framing the terms. <HI>Ludwig,</HI> of <HI>Leip&s;ic,</HI> who has endeavoured to com|bine the &s;y&s;tems of <HI>Rivinus</HI> and LINNAEUS, by taking his <HI>cla&s;&s;es</HI> from the method of the former, and his <HI>orders</HI> from that of the latter, has avoided this mode of expre&s;&s;ion, in &s;ub&s;tituting the terms <HI>monantherae, mono&s;tylae,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The author begins the new and enlarged edition of the <HI>Sy&s;tema Vegetabilium</HI> of 1767, by premi&s;ing a compendious view of the philo&s;ophy of vege|tation, and then proceeds to what he calls <HI>Delineatio Plantae,</HI> &s;omething analogous to what he had en|titled, in the editions prior to the 10th, <HI>Methodus Demon&s;trandi Vegetabilia.</HI> Here he introduces all the terms he makes u&s;e of in de&s;cribing plants, and, by a methodical and apt di&s;po&s;ition of them, really explains them at the &s;ame time. After this, he gives the <HI>Clavis et Characteres Cla&s;&s;ium,</HI> and then comes to the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The prerogative of any artificial &s;y&s;tem in botany, <HI>is &s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to con&s;i&s;t in its keeping toge|ther, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the <HI>genera,</HI> in what are called the <HI>natural cla&s;&s;es</HI> or orders, and thus &s;o far approaching to the &s;y&s;tem of nature. All <HI>artificial</HI> &s;y&s;tems being founded on <HI>&s;ome,</HI> or <HI>other,</HI> or <HI>all</HI> the parts of <HI>fructification,</HI> without regard to <HI>habit,</HI> will be found in many in&s;tances to break the order of the <HI>natural</HI> cla&s;&s;es, and disjoin <HI>genera,</HI> which nature &s;eems to have cla&s;&s;ed. The more &s;imple and uniform the cla&s;&s;ical characters of any &s;y&s;tem are, the more they are likely to interfere in this re&s;pect; neverthele&s;s, it is plea&s;ing to ob&s;erve, how
<PB N="118" REF="123">
well many of the <HI>natural</HI> cla&s;&s;es are kept together in the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;y&s;tem; the characters of which enjoy the advantage of being very &s;imple, and ea&s;y to retain in the memory, and of being found|ed on the parts of plants as little &s;ubject to vari|ation as any whatever: yet, like all other me|thods, it has its defects; of which no one was more &s;en&s;ible than the author him&s;elf. There are many in&s;tances of particular &s;pecies that break through the <HI>generical</HI> and cla&s;&s;ical characters of the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf: but for the&s;e defects there is no other remedy, at pre&s;ent, than that which our au|thor has applied, in the volume under con&s;idera|tion, and which ought ever, in arrangements of this kind, to be rigidly ob&s;erved. Wherever the&s;e <HI>anomalies</HI> take place, they are mentioned among the <HI>fictitious</HI> characters, under the cla&s;s and order to which the <HI>number</HI> of <HI>&s;tamina</HI> or <HI>pi&s;tils</HI> entitle them to a place.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;exual</HI> &s;y&s;tem briefly is as follows:&mdash;All known plants are divided into 24 CLASSES; the characters of which are e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the <HI>num|ber,</HI> or different &s;ituation, or arrangement of the <HI>&s;tamina</HI> or male organs; and the ORDERS, or &s;ub|divi&s;ions, of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es, as far as po&s;&s;ible, on a &s;imilar number, &s;ituation, or arrangement, of the <HI>pi&s;tils,</HI> or female organs.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t twenty cla&s;&s;es contain what the author calls <HI>hermaphrodite</HI> flowers, or &s;uch as have the <HI>&s;ta|mina</HI> and <HI>pi&s;tils</HI> both within the &s;ame <HI>cup</HI> or <HI>petals,</HI> or &s;tanding on the &s;ame <HI>receptacle,</HI> where tho&s;e are wanting.

<P>The 12th, ICOSANDRIA; &s;uch plants as have about 20 &s;tamina, or more; but always ari&s;ing from the <HI>calyx</HI> or <HI>corolla,</HI> and not from the <HI>recep|tacle.</HI></P>

<P>The &s;econdary part of the &s;y&s;tem, the OR|DERS, or &s;ubdivi&s;ions of the foregoing cla&s;&s;es, are e&s;tabli&s;hed on the <HI>number</HI> of the <HI>pi&s;tils</HI> or female parts, through a con&s;iderable part of the &s;y&s;tem; but in other parts, from various characters. Thus,</P>
<P>The arrangement from number is pur&s;ued no farther than through the fir&s;t thirteen cla&s;&s;es: that is, &s;o long as the <HI>cla&s;&s;ical</HI> character, uninterrup|tedly, depends on the <HI>number</HI> of <HI>&s;tamina,</HI> &s;o long the <HI>orders</HI> likewi&s;e depend on the <HI>number</HI> of <HI>pi&s;tils:</HI> but, when <HI>&s;ituation</HI> or different <HI>arrangement</HI> take place, the <HI>orders</HI> are mo&s;t commonly founded on other di&s;tinctions, which we &s;hall briefly &s;pecify.</P>
<P>The 14th cla&s;s, or <HI>Didynamia,</HI> is divided into GYMNOSPERMIA and ANGIOSPERMIA: the former having four naked &s;eeds; the latter having the &s;eeds inclo&s;ed in a &s;eed-ve&s;&s;el.</P>

<P>Tho&s;e of the <HI>Syngene&s;ia</HI> cla&s;s are &s;ix: in five of which the plants are POLYGAMIAE, and in the remaining one MONOGAMIAE; and the differences in the orders of the former, ari&s;e from the different &s;tructure or &s;ex of the <HI>flo&s;cules,</HI> con&s;tituting the whole flower.</P>

<P>The GENERA are e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the a&s;&s;em|blage of all the parts of fructification compared together, according to their <HI>number, figure, pro|portion,</HI> and <HI>&s;ituation.</HI> Of the&s;e we have &s;poken before, as they con&s;titute a large volume in oc|tavo, to which we refer.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the&s;e NATURAL CHARACTERS, or GENERA at large, our author has invented, for brevity's &s;ake, two other kinds of characters, which he calls FACTITIOUS and ESSENTIAL. The former &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h each genus from other <HI>genera</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>artificial</HI> order only, by enume|rating the mo&s;t remarkable differences: the&s;e greatly facilitate the labour of a young botani&s;t. The ESSENTIAL characters, could they be rendered perfect, are de&s;igned to di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>genera</HI> from each other in the <HI>natural</HI> orders; but they are not complete as yet, except in a few in&s;tances; and
<PB N="128" REF="133">
po&s;&s;ibly they exi&s;t but in a &s;mall number: never|thele&s;s, they are attempted through the whole &s;y&s;tem, to &s;ave the trouble of turning over the <HI>na|tural characters</HI> at large.</P>
<P>As this volume was intended to contain all the plants hitherto known, con&s;equently the <HI>natural</HI> characters could not be introduced; but the <HI>fic|titious</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> ones are placed, the former at the head of each <HI>cla&s;s,</HI> and the latter before each <HI>genus.</HI> With each generical name the author refers to the number where it is exhibited at large, in the la&s;t edition of the <HI>Genera Plantarum</HI> in 1764, and to the page of the <HI>Species Plantarum</HI> of 1762, where the &s;pecies are detailed and the <HI>&s;y|nonyms</HI> added; as he gives in this volume only the &s;pecific name invented by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In forming the la&s;t branch of the &s;y&s;tem, the SPECIFIC names, LINNAEUS has done more than all the writers on the &s;ubject had done before him, and taken the utmo&s;t pains to fix them upon di&s;tinctions as permanent and invariable as po&s;|&s;ible. This is indeed the ultimate object of all method; and on this plan he has given new <HI>&s;pe|cific</HI> names to all the plants that have come to his knowledge: names, not taken (as had been cu&s;|tomary before) from that of the di&s;coverer, the likene&s;s of the plant to other &s;pecies, place of growth, time of flowering, its &s;ize, the colour of the flower, or of the plant, &s;mell, ta&s;te, or vir|tues in medicine, or any other &s;uch vague, in|definite, or mutable circum&s;tance; but from &s;ome remarkable difference in the root, trunk,
<PB N="129" REF="134">
&s;talk, and particularly the leaf, foliation, ramifica|tion, or &s;ome other abiding di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e <HI>&s;pecific</HI> names or de&s;criptions, LIN|NAEUS has invented, and, in all his works, after the fir&s;t edition of the <HI>Species Plantarum</HI> in 1753, has applied what he calls TRIVIAL names to each plant, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;ingle adjunct to the generical name, expre&s;&s;ive, if po&s;&s;ible, of &s;ome e&s;&s;ential di&s;|tinction of the &s;pecies: as for in&s;tance, <HI>integrifo|lia, laciniata, erecta, repens, aquatica, montana,</HI> &amp;c.: &s;ometimes, of the name of the inventor; and where, from the laws of his <HI>Fundamenta Botanica,</HI> he has been obliged to change the generical name of a plant well known before, and e&s;pecially if it was an <HI>officinal</HI> one, he frequently retains the <HI>old generical</HI> name as his <HI>trivial</HI> epithet. Thus as the Penny-royal, or <HI>Pulegium,</HI> really belongs to the <HI>Mentha</HI> genus, according to his characters, he therefore calls it <HI>Mentha Pulegium.</HI> The Hor&s;e|radi&s;h, known by the old name <HI>Armoracia,</HI> as it agrees with the <HI>Cochlearia</HI> genus, he calls <HI>Cochle|aria Armoracia.</HI></P>
<P>The VARIETIES of plants, which, for want of fixing true <HI>&s;pecific</HI> characters, had almo&s;t increa&s;ed the number of plants double what LINNAEUS thinks they really are, in this work, as in the SPECIES, are totally excluded. Our author has indeed, in the opinion of many of his contemporary botani&s;ts, carried this matter too far, in di&s;allowing the name of &s;pecies to many plants that are thought to have &s;ufficiently permanent di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>To conclude, the &s;pace of time elap&s;ed &s;ince the publication of the <HI>Genera</HI> and <HI>Species Plantarum,</HI> to|gether
<PB N="130" REF="135">
with the va&s;t quantity of new materials ac|quired from all parts of the world, enabled our author greatly to elaborate this la&s;t edition, and to amend very many <HI>generical</HI> and <HI>&s;pecific</HI> characters; as al&s;o to make many removes, tending greatly to the advancement and perfection of his work. Among the&s;e removes, many have taken place, particularly in the <HI>Monoecious, Dioecious,</HI> and <HI>Polyga|mous</HI> cla&s;&s;es; which is the le&s;s to be wondered at, &s;ince ob&s;ervations have confirmed, that there are plants of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es which, in their younger &s;tate, have produced only male flowers, afterwards both male and female, and at length only female.</P>
<P>The <HI>Species Plantarum</HI> contains near &s;even thou|&s;and three hundred plants. In this volume, the number is augmented by the addition of new plants, and &s;uch as were unknown by our author before, to above &s;even thou&s;and eight hundred.</P>
<P>It is proper to remark, that this &s;econd tome of the Sy&s;tem was immediately preceded by MAN|TISSA PLANTARUM <HI>Generum, editionis &s;extae, et Specie|rum editionis &s;ecundae.</HI> Holm. 1767, pp. 142. in which are de&s;cribed, as in the <HI>Genera Plantarum,</HI> the natural characters at large of forty-four <HI>genera,</HI> newly con&s;tructed. The&s;e are followed by an enu|meration of upwards of four hundred and thirty new &s;pecies, with their &s;ynonyms, as in the <HI>Species Plantarum.</HI> All the&s;e plants are included in the volume of the Sy&s;tem of which we have ju&s;t given the account.</P>

<HEAD>TOM. III. The FOSSIL KINGDOM.</HEAD>
<P>We are now to accompany our author into the <HI>Fo&s;&s;il</HI> kingdom; in which, though he very early gave a &s;pecimen of his method of cla&s;&s;ing, he did not fully exemplify, as in vegetables, until the year 1768, when the third tome of the 12th edition of the <HI>Sy&s;tema</HI> was publi&s;hed, containing the REGNUM LAPIDEUM. This volume makes 222 pages, and is concluded with a &s;hort appendix of &s;ome unno|ticed, or not well de&s;cribed animals and vegetables; together with a general index of the author's own <HI>generical</HI> names throughout every part of the Sy&s;tem, di&s;tingui&s;hing by a different type the &s;ubjects of the three kingdoms, the whole amounting to 1820 <HI>genera.</HI></P>
<P>In arranging Fo&s;&s;ils, there have been various me|thods invented; each of which have had their pa|trons, and, for different purpo&s;es, each have their advantage. Some have founded the ba&s;is of their &s;y&s;tem on the <HI>figure, colour, &s;tructure,</HI> and other ex|ternal and vi&s;ible characters; yet, &s;carcely ever tru&s;ting &s;olely to the&s;e, they called in the aid of chemi&s;try, &s;o far at lea&s;t, as the mineral acids would a&s;&s;i&s;t them. Others, as the profe&s;&s;ed che|mi&s;ts and metallurgi&s;ts, have e&s;tabli&s;hed their ar|rangement chiefly on <HI>chemical principles,</HI> as more immediately leading to the <HI>origin</HI> of fo&s;&s;il bodies in general; on which it mu&s;t be acknowledged, the be&s;t ba&s;is for a &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t be built, when we are happy enough to get &s;ufficient light for this pur|po&s;e: and at pre&s;ent, mineralogi&s;ts throughout the world &s;eem more intent on this view than ever:
<PB N="132" REF="137">
and probably the due con&s;ideration and exten&s;ion of the volcanic &s;y&s;tem, will open new &s;ources of information in this way.</P>
<P>This volume begins with LINNAEUS'S own theory of the origin of fo&s;&s;il bodies in general, and their &s;everal combinations into tho&s;e forms in which we meet with them in the body of the earth. The methodical and abbreviated manner in which our author has here given his <HI>philo&s;ophy</HI> of fo&s;&s;il bodies, renders it incapable of an ab|&s;tract. He then proceeds to give a &s;ynoptical or cla&s;&s;ical view of the &s;everal &s;y&s;tems of arranging tho&s;e bodies, as they &s;tand exhibited in the be&s;t authors on the &s;ubject, beginning with <HI>Bromelius,</HI> who publi&s;hed in 1730, and enumerates <HI>Wal|lerius</HI> in 1747, <HI>Wolter&s;dorf</HI> in 1748, <HI>Cartheu&s;er</HI> in 1755, <HI>Ju&s;ti</HI> 1757, <HI>Anomymus [Cron&s;tedt]</HI> in 1758, and concludes with <HI>Vogel</HI> in 1762. To each of the&s;e he has &s;ubjoined &s;hort remarks relating to their methods, and theory of fo&s;&s;il bodies, and concludes this introductory part with an ex|planation of the terms of art u&s;ed in his own work.</P>
<P>In the&s;e <HI>termini artis,</HI> our author, with his u&s;ual preci&s;ion, has defined a &s;et of terms equally new and curious, which are principally adapted to, and u&s;ed in, the ultimate and mo&s;t difficult part of the Sy&s;tem, the &s;pecific characters. They are happily framed to expre&s;s all differences in the <HI>figures</HI> of fo&s;&s;il bodies; in their <HI>cru&s;t,</HI> or outward appear|ance; their <HI>&s;uperficies;</HI> their <HI>component particles,</HI> or <HI>fibres;</HI> in their <HI>texture,</HI> whether plated, fi&s;&s;ile, &amp;c.; in their <HI>hardne&s;s;</HI> or in their <HI>colour:</HI> the alterations
<PB N="133" REF="138">
they undergo by <HI>&s;olution,</HI> whether by acids, or by fire.</P>
<P>It has been doubted by &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable mineralogi&s;ts, whether we ought to de&s;cend below what are called <HI>generical</HI> di&s;tinctions in the fo&s;&s;il kingdom, &s;o infinitely do the &s;ubjects thereof vary, and &s;o imperceptible in general is that gradation by which they run into each other, in the various combined forms, in which they are found in the earth. In the mean time, &s;ome di&s;tinctions of this kind &s;eem quite nece&s;&s;ary in &s;y&s;tems e&s;tabli&s;hed principally on external cha|racters.

<HEAD>GENERA MORBORUM, or CLASSIFICATION of DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P>WE mu&s;t now look backwards a few years, to con&s;ider our author in another part of his Profe&s;|&s;orial character. It has been ob&s;erved, that after his e&s;tabli&s;hment at <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> one of his departments, as a profe&s;&s;or, was that of teaching the <HI>Diagno&s;is Morborum;</HI> and to this end he drew up a &s;y&s;tem,
<PB N="167" REF="172">
in which, as in natural hi&s;tory, all di&s;ea&s;es were di&s;po&s;ed into <HI>cla&s;&s;es, orders,</HI> and <HI>genera,</HI> founded on di&s;tinctions taken from the <HI>&s;ymptoms</HI> alone, no regard being had either to remote, or proximate cau&s;es. Before we proceed to a particular view of LINNAEUS'S method of cla&s;&s;ing di&s;ea&s;es, it will be proper to premi&s;e, that a <HI>no&s;ology</HI> on this plan, the great object of which is to fix <HI>pathognomonics</HI> to every di&s;ea&s;e, had been long wi&s;hed for by &s;ome writers of the fir&s;t character in the profe&s;&s;ion: &s;uch were <HI>Baglivi, Boerhaave, Gorter, Gaubius,</HI> and <HI>Syden|ham;</HI> the latter of whom has thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on this &s;ubject, in the preface to his works: <Q REND="margQuotes">Expe|dit ut morbi omnes ad definitas ac certas &s;pecies revo|centur, eadem pror&s;us diligentia ac <GAP DESC="foreign">, qua id factum videmus &agrave; botanicis &s;criptoribus in &s;uis phytologiis.</Q> Yet, amid&s;t that almo&s;t infinite variety and complication of appearances which are &s;een in di&s;ea&s;es, the difficulty of obtaining &s;uf|ficient di&s;tinctions, by which the <HI>genus</HI> and <HI>&s;pecies</HI> may be accurately di&s;criminated, mu&s;t be allowed to be very great; and po&s;&s;ibly is in many in&s;tances un&s;urmountable. Hence, &s;ome of the mo&s;t emi|nent phy&s;icians have been led to reject all &s;uch arrangements as futile, and impracticable. This, however, hath not deterred others from paying attention to the &s;ubject, more e&s;pecially &s;ome of tho&s;e, who, from their province as profe&s;&s;ors, are led to teach the rudiments of the art; and to whom method, <HI>in &s;ome form,</HI> is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary. Sy&s;tematic writers had u&s;ed various me|thods in the di&s;po&s;ition of their &s;ubject. Some
<PB N="168" REF="173">
had cho&s;en the <HI>alphabetic;</HI> if that de&s;erves the name of an arrangement: others, after the ex|ample of <HI>Aretaeus,</HI> and <HI>Caelius Aurelianus,</HI> had di|vided di&s;ea&s;es, from their duration, into <HI>acute,</HI> and <HI>chronical.</HI> Some had preferred the <HI>anatomical</HI> order; which, as it pre&s;uppo&s;es a knowledge of the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t, not unfrequently, prove fallacious: <HI>Sennertus</HI>'s is an in&s;tance of this kind. However, the <HI>&auml;itiological</HI> arrangement has been mo&s;t followed by the be&s;t writers among the moderns; &s;uch as <HI>Hoffmann,</HI> and <HI>Boerhaave;</HI> al|though perhaps not much le&s;s fallacious than the anatomical, &s;ince it is in many in&s;tances founded on an hypothe&s;is of the writer: and though <HI>Felix Platerus,</HI> in his <HI>Praxis Medica,</HI> publi&s;hed in 1602, had given an imperfect &s;ketch of a no&s;ology on the <HI>&s;ymptomatic</HI> plan, yet no writer ventured to pur&s;ue his idea, for more than a century after his time; di&s;couraged as it &s;hould &s;eem by the diffi|culty of the attempt. At length the late profe&s;|&s;or M. SAUVAGES of <HI>Montpelier,</HI> after communi|cating his &s;cheme to <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> publi&s;hed in 1731, in 12^m^o. the outlines of &s;uch a work, under the title of <HI>Nouvelles Cla&s;&s;es des Maladies,</HI> in which he profe&s;&s;es to define di&s;ea&s;es, from <HI>their con&s;tant and evident &s;ymptoms only.</HI> In the year 1763, the au|thor augmented his work, by the addition of the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> under each <HI>genus,</HI> into 5 volumes in 8^v^o. <HI>Sauvages</HI> may be con&s;idered as having &s;pent his life in giving to this de&s;ign a certain degree of perfec|tion, having enlarged it into 2 quarto volumes, in which form it was publi&s;hed after his death in
<PB N="169" REF="174">
1768: A work, it is to be pre&s;umed, now in the hands of mo&s;t phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>It will ea&s;ily be imagined, that an arrangement of this kind was too congenial to LINNAEUS to be neglected by him. In fact, it appears that he very early corre&s;ponded with <HI>Sauvages</HI> on this &s;ubject, that he &s;oon adopted it, and framed a &s;et of in&s;titutes, under the title of GENERA MOR|BORUM, as a ba&s;is of his lectures in this depart|ment. LINNAEUS'S &s;cheme was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in a <HI>the&s;is</HI> in 1759; but he had taught it in his cla&s;s for ten years preceding that time. In 1763, he publi&s;hed it him&s;elf in a &s;mall quarto; though we do not find that he ever enlarged it by the addition of the <HI>&s;pecies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ymptomatic</HI> plan of arranging di&s;ea&s;es has &s;ince been followed by &s;ome other profe&s;&s;ors of phy&s;ic; Dr. <HI>Vogel</HI> of <HI>Gottingen</HI> having publi&s;hed, in 1764, his <HI>Definitiones Generum Morborum.</HI> Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> al&s;o, who at this time fills the practical chair at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> with &s;uch de&s;erved reputation, has publi&s;hed a <HI>Synop&s;is no&s;ologiae methodicae,</HI> and has made it the ba&s;is of his <HI>Fir&s;t Lines of the Practice of Phy&s;ic.</HI> In 1776, Dr. <HI>Sagar,</HI> a phy&s;ician at <HI>Ig|law</HI> in <HI>Moravia,</HI> publi&s;hed a <HI>Sy&s;tema Morborum &s;ym|tomaticum.</HI> 8vo. <HI>Vien.</HI> pp. 756. His work, allow|ing for &s;ome alterations and additions, may be ac|counted an u&s;eful abridgement of <HI>Sauvages</HI>'s: the author, all theory apart, has de&s;cribed the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> under every <HI>genus,</HI> and &s;ubjoined the method of cure. Dr. <HI>Cullen,</HI> by omitting many <HI>genera,</HI> and reducing others to the rank of <HI>&s;pecies</HI> only, has &s;o
<PB N="170" REF="175">
con&s;iderably abridged the whole, as not to have retained more than half the number of <HI>genera,</HI> that the foregoing writers enumerate; and in this form he has publi&s;hed it, annexed to tho&s;e of the four abovementiond, by which di&s;play of each, their &s;everal merits may be compared, and a judg|ment formed of the practicability, and u&s;e of the &s;cheme in general, which, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, af|fords a very ample field for cultivation; yet, from that reform which Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> has already made in various parts, it is not, perhaps, too much to hope, that it is capable of receiving a much higher degree of improvement, in the hands of tho&s;e who&s;e genius and indu&s;try may prompt them to extend the de&s;ign of the&s;e writers.</P>
<P>Of LINNAEUS'S method we are led by our plan to exhibit a general view; to which end, although our pre&s;cribed brevity will not admit of giving his <HI>definitions</HI> at length, yet it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enumerate the <HI>names</HI> of all his <HI>genera,</HI> &s;ince no|thing &s;hort of a view of the whole collectively, could enable the reader to form a ju&s;t idea of the author's &s;cheme. Under each <HI>cla&s;s</HI> we &s;hall ob|&s;erve wherein LINNAEUS differs materially from <HI>Sauvages,</HI> and note the alterations which Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> has made in the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ame <HI>genera.</HI></P>
<P>LINNAEUS, in the cla&s;&s;ification of di&s;ea&s;es, has pretty nearly retained the arrangement of M. <HI>Sau|vages,</HI> although he has altered his terms, and con|&s;tituted one more cla&s;s, with which he begins his method; the <HI>Exanthematic,</HI> or eruptive fevers, which, in the &s;y&s;tems of <HI>Sauvages</HI> and Dr. <HI>Cullen,</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="176">
form only an <HI>order,</HI> or &s;ubdivi&s;ion of a cla&s;s. He has al&s;o changed the order of the cla&s;&s;es, and re|ferred the <HI>Vitia,</HI> or <HI>local external di&s;orders,</HI> which are principally the objects of &s;urgery, to the end of his &s;y&s;tem. In this he has been followed by the two &s;ucceeding no&s;ologi&s;ts, Dr. <HI>Vogel</HI> and Dr. <HI>Cullen.</HI> The cla&s;&s;ical di&s;tribution is, however, confe&s;&s;edly not the <HI>primary</HI> con&s;ideration; that of fixing the <HI>generical</HI> character, and determining what &s;hall con&s;titute the <HI>&s;pecifical,</HI> being the fir&s;t object of every &s;y&s;tem. To this end a &s;till farther reduction of the number of <HI>genera</HI> and <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> will probably not a little contribute.</P>

In this cla&s;s, as the di&s;ea&s;e is complicated of fever and eruption, the genus is defined from the nature of each.

We &s;hould not therefore have taken notice of it, in our plan, had it not been nece&s;&s;ary in order to explain &s;everal

papers hereafter to be mentioned in the <HI>Amoenitates Academicae.</HI> Briefly, therefore, the <HI>Linnaean</HI> prin|ciples of phy&s;ic &s;uppo&s;e the human body to con&s;i&s;t of a <HI>cerebro&s;e medullary</HI> part, of which the nerves are &s;o many proce&s;&s;es, and which we call the <HI>ner|vous</HI> &s;y&s;tem; and, a <HI>cortical</HI> or vital part, includ|ing the <HI>va&s;cular</HI> &s;y&s;tem and contained fluids: the former, being the animated part, or that in which the <HI>&s;entient,</HI> moving principle peculiarly re&s;ides, is con&s;idered as deriving its <HI>nouri&s;hment</HI> from the &s;ubtle&s;t fluids of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, and its <HI>energy</HI> from an electrical principle inhaled by the lungs. Farther, this theory &s;uppo&s;es the cir|culating fluids to be capable of being vitiated, by principles which the author chu&s;es to con&s;ider either as <HI>ace&s;cent,</HI> or <HI>putrid</HI> ferments; the former acting on the <HI>&s;erum,</HI> and being the exciting cau&s;e of <HI>critical</HI> fevers; the latter, on the blood pro|perly, or <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum,</HI> and exciting <HI>phlogi&s;tic</HI> di&s;|ea&s;es. The <HI>exanthematic</HI> cla&s;s is &s;uppo&s;ed to be excited by &s;ome external cau&s;es, which we call <HI>Contagion,</HI> and which <HI>hypothetically</HI> he propo&s;es as being <HI>animalcula.</HI> From the ince&s;&s;ant attrition of the <HI>cortical</HI> or va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, it requires perpe|tual reparation; this is to be effected by an <HI>appro|priate</HI> diet. From an <HI>impropriate</HI> diet, or regi|men, &s;pring the di&s;ea&s;es of this part of the &s;y&s;tem, originally and more particularly; the&s;e are to be remedied by <HI>&s;apid</HI> medicines, as tho&s;e of the <HI>medul|lary</HI> &s;y&s;tem are by <HI>olids.</HI> Hence ari&s;es the author's general divi&s;ion of all medicines, as di&s;coverable by their &s;en&s;ible qualities, to the <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> and <HI>&s;melling.</HI>

<P>In 1766, LINNAEUS publi&s;hed a &s;mall piece, un|der the title of CLAVIS MEDICINAE <HI>duplex, exterior et interior.</HI> Holm. 8vo. pp. 29. This &s;mall tract may be con&s;idered as a &s;yllabus of his lectures. It is an enlarged view of the theory ju&s;t mentioned, connecting it with general <HI>Pathology,</HI> and the the|rapeutic part of phy&s;ic. In the latter part all &s;imples are arranged in thirty <HI>orders,</HI> according to their &s;en&s;ible qualities, agreeably to the theory; which is di&s;played more at large in two papers printed in the <HI>Amoenitates Academicae,</HI> under the titles of <HI>Sapores, et Odores Medicamentorum.</HI></P>
<P>It appears from &s;everal parts of the writings of LINNAEUS, that the <HI>dietetic</HI> part of phy&s;ic had been an object to which he had paid much atten|tion; and he has explained him&s;elf in the follow|ing manner relating to it:&mdash;<HI>In his meae deliciae, in his plura collegi, quam quod novi alius ullus:</HI>&mdash;but, whether our author's ob&s;ervations on this &s;ub|ject may hereafter be publi&s;hed, we are yet to learn.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="206">
In 1771 was publi&s;hed LINNAEUS'S la&s;t work, being the continuation of the <HI>Manti&s;&s;a,</HI> in which the work is carried on to 588 pages, under the title of MANTISSA ALTERA. Near one half of this volume comprehends additional new <HI>genera</HI> and <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> and the remaining part a variety of emendations, with &s;ome con&s;iderable augmentation to the animal kingdom. The&s;e will greatly enrich a future edition of his works; and in the preface he has earne&s;tly intreated &s;ucceeding editors to pay a pro|per regard to them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides his &s;eparate works, which we have now brought to a conclu&s;ion, LINNAEUS wrote a great number of papers on the &s;ubjects of phy&s;ic and natural hi&s;tory, which were publi&s;hed in the <HI>Acta Literaria Up&s;alien&s;ia,</HI> and in the <HI>Stockholm Acts.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e works was begun by <HI>Olaus Cel&s;ius</HI> in 1720, and continued to the year 1750, and is in Latin, in 5 volumes, quarto.

In the &s;pring of the year 1772, Dr. <HI>Murray,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of Phy&s;ic and Botany at <HI>Gottingen,</HI> a <HI>Swede</HI> by birth, who had been educated under LINNAEUS, and had long enjoyed a great &s;hare of his confidence and e&s;teem, paid his Preceptor a vi&s;it: he found his faculties unimpaired, and his ardor for the improvement of &s;cience as &s;trong and vigorous as ever. He &s;peaks with great de|light of the &s;atisfaction he received from his com|pany, and in the contemplation and in&s;pection of his mu&s;eum at <HI>Hammarby;</HI> but regretted much to find, that LINNAEUS had no farther thoughts of publi&s;hing a new edition of his <HI>Sy&s;tem of Nature;</HI> purpo&s;ing only to give a &s;upplement. However, before Dr. <HI>Murray</HI> left <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> he prevailed on him to promi&s;e that he would tran&s;mit to him his ad|ditional ob&s;ervations to the <HI>Sy&s;tema Vegetabilium,</HI> in order to enable him to give a complete edition of that work. This the Profe&s;&s;or did; and Dr. <HI>Murray</HI> performed it in the year 1774, very much to the &s;atisfaction of all who pur&s;ue the LINNAEAN method. The manu&s;cript additions communica|ted on this occa&s;ion by our author, together with tho&s;e collected from the &s;everal <HI>Addenda,</HI> and from the <HI>Manti&s;&s;ae,</HI> enabled Dr. <HI>Murray</HI> to extend this volume to above one hundred pages beyond that of the 12th edition publi&s;hed in 1767.</P>
<P>It appears that LINNAEUS, upon the whole, en|joyed a good con&s;titution. At times, however, he had been &s;everely afflicted with an <HI>hemicrania;</HI> and had not been exempted from the gout. How much he &s;uffered from this latter di&s;temper, we
<PB N="211" REF="216">
have before mentioned, when treating on the <HI>Phi|lo&s;ophia Botanica.</HI> And notwith&s;tanding the &s;ound &s;tate in which Dr. <HI>Murray</HI> left him, we find, that very &s;oon after, his memory became &s;omewhat impaired. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this defect was &s;aid to have induced him to decline all thoughts of further publications, and to tran&s;mit to Dr. <HI>Mur|ray</HI> &s;uch materials as were in readine&s;s to compleat future editions of his <HI>Sy&s;tem.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of 1776, it was known here that his &s;trength was declining apace, and his infirmi|ties in general much increa&s;ed, he being unable to take his u&s;ual walks in his garden without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At the latter end of the year he was &s;eized with an <HI>apoplexy,</HI> which left him paralytic; and at the be|ginning of the year 1777 he &s;uffered another &s;troke, which very much impaired his mental powers. The&s;e attacks, at his advanced &s;tage of life, &s;hew|ed that di&s;&s;olution was not far off. But the di&s;|ea&s;e, which was &s;aid to have been the more imme|diate cau&s;e of his death, was an ulceration of the urinary bladder. Neverthele&s;s, he langui&s;hed through the year, and died on the 11th of <HI>January,</HI> 1778, aged 70 years and 8 months.</P>
<P>To the lovers of &s;cience it will not appear &s;trange, nor will it be unplea&s;ant, to hear, that uncommon re&s;pect was &s;hewn to the memory of this great man. We are told, that, <Q REND="margQuotes">on his death, a general mourning took place at <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> and that his funeral proce&s;&s;ion was attended by the whole univer&s;ity, as well profe&s;&s;ors as &s;tu|dents, and the pall &s;upported by &s;ixteen doctors

Nor was he honoured only in his own country.

The high reputation which this great man has long held among the naturali&s;ts throughout the world, might readily perhaps preclude any encomium from our pen; &s;ince, to all lovers of <HI>natural</HI> &s;ci|ence, his <HI>name</HI> it&s;elf is eulogy, and will doubtle&s;s very long be in&s;eparable from the idea of his ex|traordinary merit. Might we, neverthele&s;s, be indulged &s;o far, we hope the following brief e&s;ti|mate of his talents will be thought ju&s;t, and ea&s;ily deduced from an impartial view of his writings.</P>
<P>Nature had, in an eminent manner, been liberal in the endowments of his mind. He &s;eems to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a lively imagination, corrected however by a &s;trong judgment, and guided by the laws of &s;y&s;tem. Add to the&s;e, the mo&s;t retentive memory, an unremitting indu&s;try, and the greate&s;t per&s;everance in all his pur&s;uits; as is evident from that continued vigour with which he pro&s;ecuted the de&s;ign, that he appears to have formed &s;o early in life, of totally reforming, and fabricating anew the whole &s;cience of natural hi&s;tory: and this fabric he rai&s;ed, and gave to it a degree of perfection unknown before; and had moreover the un|common felicity of living to &s;ee his own &s;truc|ture ri&s;e above all others, notwith&s;tanding every di&s;couragement its author at fir&s;t laboured under, and the oppo&s;ition it afterwards met with. Neither has any writer more cautiou&s;ly avoided that com|mon error of building his own fame on the ruin of another man's. He every where acknowledged the &s;everal merits of each author's &s;y&s;tem; and no man appears to have been more &s;en&s;ible of the <HI>par|tial</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="219">
<HI>defects</HI> of his own. Tho&s;e anomalies which had principally been the objects of critici&s;m, he well knew every <HI>artificial</HI> arrangement mu&s;t abound with; and having laid it down as a firm maxim, that every &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t finally re&s;t on its in|trin&s;ic merit, he willingly commits his own to the judgment of po&s;terity. Perhaps there is no cir|cum&s;tance of LINNAEUS'S life, which &s;hews him in a more dignified light, than his conduct to|wards his opponents. Di&s;avowing controver&s;y, and ju&s;tly con&s;idering it as an unimportant and fruitle&s;s &s;acrifice of time, he never replied to any, numerous as they were at one &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>To all who &s;ee the aid this extraordinary man has brought to <HI>natural &s;cience,</HI> his talents mu&s;t appear in a very illu&s;trious point of view; but more e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who, from &s;imilarity of ta&s;te, are qualified to &s;ee more di&s;tinctly the va&s;t extent of his original de&s;ign, the greatne&s;s of his labour, and the elaborate execution he has given to the whole. He had a happy command of the Latin tongue, which is alone the language of &s;cience; and no man ever applied it more &s;ucce&s;sfully to his purpo&s;es, or gave to de&s;cription &s;uch copi|ou&s;ne&s;s, united with that preci&s;ion and conci&s;ene&s;s, which &s;o eminently characterize his writings.</P>
<P>In the mean time, we are not to learn, that it has been objected as derogatory to his learning in no &s;mall degree, that he has introduced a num|ber of terms not authorized by cla&s;&s;ical authority. But, granting this, it ought to be recollected, that LINNAEUS, in the inve&s;tigation of nature, has
<PB N="215" REF="220">
di&s;covered a multitude of relations which were entirely unknown to the antients; if therefore there be any force in the objection, it &s;hould fir&s;t be &s;hewn, that the terms which he has introduced to expre&s;s the&s;e relations, are not fairly and analo|gically deduced from the language; &s;ince it mu&s;t &s;urely be granted, that LINNAEUS could not have &s;poken the language of <HI>natural hi&s;tory,</HI> as it is known at this day, in that of <HI>Pliny,</HI> or of any cla&s;|&s;ical writer whatever.</P>
<P>The ardor of LINNAEUS'S inclinations to the &s;tudy of nature, from his earlie&s;t years, and that uncommon application which he be&s;towed upon it, gave him a mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive view, both of its plea&s;ures and u&s;efulne&s;s, at the &s;ame time that it opened to him a wide field, hitherto but little cultivated, e&s;pecially in his own country. Hence he was early led to regret, that the &s;tudy of natural hi&s;tory, as a public in&s;titution, had not made its way into the univer&s;ities; in many of which, logical di&s;|putations, and metaphy&s;ical theories, had too long prevailed, to the exclu&s;ion of more u&s;eful &s;ci|ence. Availing him&s;elf therefore of the advan|tages which he derived from a large &s;hare of elo|quence, and an animated &s;tyle, he never failed to di&s;play, in a lively and convincing manner, the relation this &s;tudy hath to the public good; to incite the great to countenance and protect it; to encourage and allure youth into its pur&s;uits, by opening its manifold &s;ources of plea&s;ure to their view, and &s;hewing them how greatly this agreeable employment would add, in a variety of in&s;tances,
<PB N="216" REF="221">
both to their comfort and emolument. His ex|ten&s;ive view of natural hi&s;tory, as connected with almo&s;t all the arts of life, did not allow him to confine the&s;e motives and incitements to tho&s;e only who were de&s;igned for the practice of phy&s;ic. He al&s;o laboured to in&s;pire the great and opulent with a ta&s;te for this &s;tudy; and wi&s;hed particularly that &s;uch as were devoted to an eccle&s;ia&s;tic life &s;hould &s;hare a portion of natural &s;cience, not only as a means of &s;weetening their rural &s;itu|ation, confined, as many are, perpetually to a country re&s;idence, but as what would almo&s;t in|evitably lead, in a variety of in&s;tances, to di&s;co|veries which only &s;uch &s;ituations could give ri&s;e to, and which the learned in great cities could have no opportunities to make. Not to add, that the mutual communication and enlargement of this kind of knowledge among people of equal rank in a country &s;ituation, mu&s;t prove one of the &s;tronge&s;t bonds of union and friend&s;hip, and con|tribute, in a much higher degree than the u&s;ual peri&s;hing amu&s;ements of the age, to the plea&s;ures and advantages of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS lived to enjoy the fruit of his own labour in an uncommon degree. Natural hi&s;|tory rai&s;ed it&s;elf in <HI>Sweden,</HI> under his culture, to a &s;tate of perfection unknown el&s;ewhere, and was from thence di&s;&s;eminated through all <HI>Europe.</HI> His pupils di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves all over the globe, and with their ma&s;ter's fame, ex|tended both &s;cience and their own.

<P>From the earlie&s;t times, the cultivation of the fig-tree has been an important object in all the oriental countries. In this di&s;&s;ertation we are pre&s;ented with a hi&s;tory of this <HI>genus,</HI> of which
<PB N="223" REF="228">
the writer has enumerated 22 &s;pecies: LINNAEUS has however greatly reduced this number, in his <HI>Species Plantarum,</HI> &s;ince many are varieties effected by culture. That part of the hi&s;tory of this tree, which for many ages was &s;o enigmatical, and which nothing but the doctrine of the &s;exes of plants has completely cleared up, namely the hu&s;bandry or <HI>caprification,</HI> as it is called, is more particularly worthy of attention, not only as a &s;ingular pheno|menon in it&s;elf, but as it has furni&s;hed one of the mo&s;t convincing proofs of the reality of the &s;exes of plants. Our limits will not allow us to detail this &s;ubject; in brief it is this:&mdash;It is now known, that the flowers of the fig-tree are &s;ituated within a pulpy receptacle, which we call the <HI>Fig,</HI> or fruit of this tree; of the&s;e receptacles, in the wild fig-tree, &s;ome have male flowers only, and others have male and female, both di&s;tinct, though placed in the &s;ame receptacle. In the garden, or <HI>cultivated</HI> fig, the&s;e are found to contain only fe|male flowers; which are fecundated by means of a kind of gnat, <HI>(Cynips P&s;enes,</HI> Sy&s;t. Nat. 919.) bred in the fruit of the <HI>wild</HI> fig-trees, which pierces that of the <HI>cultivated,</HI> in order to depo&s;it its eggs within; at the &s;ame time diffu&s;ing within the re|ceptacle the <HI>farina</HI> of the male flowers. Without this operation the fruit may ripen, but no <HI>effective</HI> &s;eeds are produced: hence the <HI>garden</HI> fig can only be propagated by layers and cuttings, in the&s;e countries, where the <HI>wild</HI> fig is not known. The proce&s;s of thus ripening the fruit, in the oriental countries, is not left to nature, but is managed
<PB N="224" REF="229">
with great art, and different degrees of dexterity, &s;o as to reward the &s;kilful hu&s;bandman with a much larger increa&s;e of fruit than would other|wi&s;e be produced. A tree of the &s;ame &s;ize, which, in <HI>Provence,</HI> where caprification is not practi&s;ed, may produce about 25 pounds of fruit, will, by that art, in the <HI>Grecian</HI> i&s;lands, bring ten times that quantity.</P>

this attempt, and an enumeration of tho&s;e <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>artificial</HI> orders in botany, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to illu&s;trate and confirm the po&s;&s;ibility of attain|ing this de&s;irable end.

unfrequently found extended from the <HI>duodenum,</HI> almo&s;t through the whole tract of the inte&s;tines.

<P>Intended to awaken curio&s;ity, and excite atten|tion to the &s;tudy of in&s;ects, by pointing out the extraordinary in&s;tincts and properties with which particular kinds are endued; many of who&s;e operations were inexplicable, and frequently attri|buted to other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Nothing exemplifies this truth more than the hi&s;tory of a minute in&s;ect, or rather worm, of which we have, in this di&s;&s;ertation, the fir&s;t proper intelligence; it is very curious, and worthy of notice. In <HI>Finland, Bothnia,</HI> and the northern provinces of <HI>Sweden,</HI> it was not unfrequently that people were &s;eized with a pungent pain, confined to a point, in the hand, or other expo&s;ed part of the body, which pre&s;ently increa&s;ed to a mo&s;t ex|cruciating degree, hath &s;ometimes been &s;ud|denly fatal. This di&s;order was more particularly ob&s;erved in <HI>Finland,</HI> e&s;pecially about boggy and mar&s;hy places, and always in autumn. At length it was di&s;covered, that this pain in&s;tantly &s;ucceeded &s;omewhat that dropped out of the air&punc; and in a moment penetrated and buried it&s;elf in the fle&s;h. The <HI>Finlanders</HI> had tried variety of applications to no purpo&s;e, until at length a poultice of curds, or
<PB N="260" REF="265">
chee&s;e, was found the mo&s;t effectual in ea&s;ing the pain; and the event confirmed, that the in&s;ect was allured by this application to leave the fle&s;h; as on its removal, this worm, no longer than the &s;ixth of an inch, was found in it, and thus the cau&s;e of this painful di&s;ea&s;e explained. LIN|NAEUS him&s;elf once &s;uffered from this animal the effect here &s;poken of: but we owe the com|plete hi&s;tory of it, and its place in the Sy&s;tem, to Dr. SOLANDER, who gave it in to the Royal Academy of Sciences at <HI>Up&s;al.</HI> This worm &s;tands in the Sy&s;tem under the name of <HI>Furia Infernalis,</HI> p. 1325; but by what means this creature is rai&s;ed into the air, is as yet unknown.</P>

<P>The intention of this paper is to prove, that the knowledge of the <HI>Natale Solum,</HI> the natural places of growth of plants, is the true foundation on which the art of gardening &s;ucce&s;sfully mu&s;t be built.

<P>Every plant has its natural &s;ituation and &s;oil, in which alone it will thrive, and out of which, in many in&s;tances, no care or culture will pre&s;erve it alive.

<P>The alps of <HI>Europe</HI> produce a &s;et of vegetables very different from, and incapable of culture in, the lower &s;ituations. The author of this tract, who was a native of one of the provinces border|ing on the <HI>alps</HI> of <HI>Lapland,</HI> with a laudable zeal for the improvement of his country, enquires what kinds of vegetables might be cultivated in tho&s;e de&s;art regions to the mo&s;t advantage, where &s;o few thrive, where &s;hrubs &s;carcely ever attain even a moderate &s;ize, and where a tree will hardly grow erect.</P>
<P>To this end, he fir&s;t enumerates all the alpine parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and gives a li&s;t of 400 plants pe|culiar to tho&s;e &s;ituations. He expre&s;&s;es a wi&s;h, that at the royal, or public expence, a garden might be planted in the <HI>alps,</HI> to determine with preci&s;ion what exotic plants would bear introduction into <HI>Lapland;</HI> and concludes by pointing out &s;ome of the e&s;culent and medicinal kinds, as al&s;o &s;ome that are applicable to dyeing, and other arts, which he thinks might be culti|vated to advantage in that northern region.</P>

<P>This paper is confe&s;&s;edly one of the mo&s;t com|plete that has been publi&s;hed on this curious &s;ub|ject, which is yet involved in con&s;iderable ob&s;cu|rity; the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of the&s;e migrations, with re&s;pect to &s;everal birds, and the places of their re&s;ort, being yet unknown. With re&s;pect to the greater number, it cannot be doubted but that the facility of find|ing their appropriate food in di&s;tant countries, in the different &s;ea&s;ons, and their &s;ecurity during in|cubation, have the principal &s;hare in this part of their economy.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ecmark</HI> ob&s;erves, that the greater number of migrating birds belong to the <HI>flat-billed</HI> order <HI>(An&s;eres),</HI> particularly to the Goo&s;e and Mergan&s;er <HI>genera;</HI> and to the Waders, <HI>(Grallae):</HI> the former mo&s;tly breed in the extreme north, where, from the relation of LINNAEUS, their number almo&s;t darkens the air, and they are driven &s;outhward by the freezing of the lakes and rivers. Numbers al&s;o of the &s;mall-billed birds <HI>(Pa&s;&s;eres),</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e with <HI>&s;lender bills,</HI> are of the migrating cla&s;s.

<P>It is no &s;mall merit in Mr. <HI>Ecmark,</HI> that in this paper he brings together, in one view, more com|pletely

<P>The author of this tract was phy&s;ician to the fleet of ob&s;ervation, which was fitted out in the beginning of the la&s;t war between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> to act in conjunction with the <HI>Danes,</HI> in the north &s;ea. The <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> &s;qua|dron con&s;i&s;ted of eight &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates. When M. <HI>Bierchen</HI> took his appoint|ment in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> he found not fewer than 1900 men on the &s;ick li&s;t; and that the principal di&s;ea&s;es were <HI>Fluxes, Fevers,</HI> and the <HI>Scurvy.</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> were attended with great pain in the bowels, extreme weakne&s;s, fever, and a very weak pul&s;e. The <HI>Fevers</HI> were of that kind which has been
<PB N="289" REF="294">
called the <HI>Up&s;al Fever,</HI> from its having been re|markably epidemical in that city and neighbour|hood. This di&s;ea&s;e was evidently of that cla&s;s which is called <HI>putrid,</HI> and was much more acute in &s;ummer than in autumn. It was at|tended with frequent and ob&s;tinate <HI>haemorrhages</HI> from the no&s;e, early in the di&s;ea&s;e; a quiet kind of <HI>delirium; trembling tongue; twitching tendons; deafne&s;s; petechiae;</HI> and <HI>vibices</HI> on the &s;kin. As the heat declined, <HI>haemorrhages</HI> were not &s;o much ob&s;erved; the di&s;order attacked with <HI>pain</HI> and <HI>la&s;|&s;itude</HI> of body, <HI>vertigo</HI> and <HI>pain</HI> in the head, <HI>cough</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> of the brea&s;t; and was afterwards attended with <HI>cardialgia, nau&s;ea, vomiting, turbid,</HI> and &s;ometimes in the decline, <HI>bloody urine.</HI> Al&s;o great <HI>pro&s;tration</HI> of &s;trength, <HI>weak pul&s;e,</HI> and <HI>&s;ub|&s;ultus tendinum,</HI> were &s;ymptoms of this fever; and many were &s;eized in the beginning with violent <HI>fluxes.</HI> The <HI>Scurvy</HI> &s;eems to have been attended with no other than the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Our author appears to have been very &s;olicitous in his endeavours to find out the cau&s;e of the ex|treme prevalence of this di&s;ea&s;e in the fleet. In the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> be&s;ides the u&s;e of &s;alted meats, he attri|butes much to the want of &s;ufficient exerci&s;e on board the &s;hips; and confirms the ob&s;ervations of &s;ome other writers, that the di&s;ea&s;e, independent of regimen or diet, decrea&s;ed when the fleet was out at &s;ea, and con&s;equently the &s;hips more agi|tated by wind and waves, and the men more em|ployed; and that it augmented when they were in a &s;tate of inaction in port. He condemns the u&s;e
<PB N="290" REF="295">
of fat and lard, as difficult of coction, and favour|able to the di&s;ea&s;e. In the cure, he recommends acids; and &s;ays, he u&s;ed principally the <HI>vitriolic:</HI> but above all he celebrates the prai&s;es of <HI>&s;our|krout;</HI> for the efficacy of which he al&s;o cites the authority and experience of Sir <HI>John Pringle.</HI></P>
<P>He con&s;iders the <HI>Fevers</HI> as ari&s;ing from impeded per&s;piration, co-operating with the effects of cold, moi&s;t, and foul air; and in <HI>this expedition,</HI> he thinks, the in&s;ufficiency of proper cloathing dur|ing the <HI>watches</HI> might not unfrequently be found a predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e. He is of opinion that the di&s;ea&s;e was contagious; and &s;ays, many were cured by the early exhibition of <HI>emetics.</HI> In the general method of cure, the practice laid down by our later writers in <HI>England</HI> was &s;ucce&s;sfully pur|&s;ued.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fluxes</HI> and <HI>Dy&s;enteric</HI> di&s;orders he a&s;cribes particularly to the prevalence of <HI>&s;aline</HI> and <HI>putrid</HI> acrimony in the food of &s;eamen; aided by foul air, and want of exerci&s;e, and propagated at length by contagion too.</P>
<P>Our author concludes, by &s;ugge&s;ting that there are two cau&s;es, of a general and permanent nature, which predi&s;po&s;e to the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es in all naval ex|peditions. The&s;e are, <HI>impure air,</HI> and a con&s;tant depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits in &s;eamen, not hitherto &s;uffi|ciently attended to, and inducing a degree of real <HI>No&s;talgia.</HI> He &s;eems to be &s;ufficiently aware of the importance of correcting the fir&s;t, and re|commends &s;trongly the u&s;e of <HI>ventilators;</HI> to the other it is not ea&s;y to apply a remedy. He informs us, that both <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> find the greate&s;t
<PB N="291" REF="296">
relief, in the <HI>Maladie du pais,</HI> next to their return home, from &s;trong exerci&s;e: however he hints his wi&s;hes, that the <HI>pay</HI> of the men was advanced, as one of the be&s;t means of in&s;piring them with chear|fulne&s;s and hilarity, nece&s;&s;ary to counterbalance this evil, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree.</P>
<P>To conclude, the &s;ubject of this paper has been &s;o well treated by &s;everal later judicious writers among&s;t us, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> phy&s;ician cannot ex|pect to meet with much new matter in this di&s;|&s;ertation; but it is neverthele&s;s very worthy the regard of all who wi&s;h to make them&s;elves acquaint|ed with the di&s;ea&s;es of the navy.</P>

In &s;ome years indeed, he ob&s;erves, that it &s;eemed to have changed its form, was attended with <HI>Petechiae,</HI> and became contagious, under which appearance it was named <HI>Febris Petechizans,</HI> and <HI>Febris Nervo&s;a,</HI> when attended particularly with <HI>delirium</HI> and &s;pa&s;ms.

<P><PB N="292" REF="297">
In &s;eeking the cau&s;es of the frequency of this fever, in <HI>Up&s;al</HI> particularly, our author accedes to that opinion which attributes <HI>intermitting</HI> and <HI>exacerbating</HI> fevers to the effects of <HI>moi&s;t</HI> and <HI>foul</HI> air, and thinks, from the &s;ituation of the city of <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> the clo&s;ene&s;s of the &s;treets, and e&s;pecially from the &s;tagnating canals and waters, that its pre|valence in that city may fairly be referred to this cau&s;e.

<P>In the <HI>Progno&s;tics,</HI> he &s;ays, a &s;tiffne&s;s of the neck was not uncommon, and that it u&s;ually betokened a long continuance of the di&s;ea&s;e; and frequently ended in convul&s;ions, or other dangerous affec|tions of the nervous &s;y&s;tem.</P>

The <HI>Sapor Medicamentorum</HI> of this collec|tion,
<PB N="303" REF="308">
N^o 30, may be con&s;idered as a comment on the fir&s;t part of this general di&s;tribution of medi|cines, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the term <HI>Sapida;</HI> and the pre&s;ent <HI>the&s;is</HI> as an explanation of a large divi&s;ion of the <HI>Olida,</HI> here called <HI>Graveolentia,</HI> from their &s;trong and ungrateful &s;mell.</P>
<P>The combinations of <HI>Sapids</HI> and <HI>Olids</HI> are innu|merable; but that &s;imples, &s;trictly of the latter kind, do, in a &s;udden and extraordinary manner, exert their influence on the nerves, is certain; though our author contents him&s;elf with the fact, without enquiring whether the functions of the nerves are performed by means of animal &s;pirits, by vibration, the medium of electricity, or by any other way. And from the <HI>Graveolentia,</HI> which are the &s;ubject of his the&s;is, he ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that we derive &s;ome of the mo&s;t powerful remedies. Of the&s;e he gives a catalogue, dividing them into three cla&s;&s;es: 1. SUBINSIPID. 2. ACRID. 3. BIT|TER: each of which is &s;ubdivided into two orders, as the &s;ubjects differ in degrees of &s;trength. The <HI>Subin&s;ipid</HI> contains chiefly the Narcotics: the <HI>Acrid</HI> &s;everal of the purging, and fetid roots; the fetid gums, and carminative &s;eeds: the <HI>Bitter</HI> con|tains others of the purging roots and leaves; and &s;ome of the bitter herbs. Under each, the au|thor &s;pecifies, in technical terms, very briefly, the quality, and the di&s;ea&s;es to which it has been ap|propriated.</P>
<P>He then pre&s;ents us with a conci&s;e, but very in|&s;tructive theory, of the operation of this divi&s;ion of the <HI>Olida;</HI> leaving to the con&s;ideration of others, the <HI>Suaveolentia:</HI> after which, follows a general

<HEAD>94. ANIMALIA COMPOSITA. <HI>A. Back.</HI> 1759.</HEAD>
<P>Under the term <HI>Animalia Compo&s;ita</HI> are compre|hended the two la&s;t orders of the cla&s;s of <HI>Vermes,</HI> making the la&s;t links in the chain of animal na|ture; and thus connecting it with the vegetable kingdom. The&s;e (in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of the three foregoing orders of the &s;ame cla&s;s, which live &s;imple and &s;eparate from each other) are called <HI>Compound Animals,</HI> as being connected together by one common ba&s;e or &s;upport, either in the form of irregular or rudely-branched &s;tony ma&s;&s;es, of a calcareous nature, as the <HI>Lithophyta,</HI> or Corals; or, as fixed to one common &s;talk more or le&s;s branched, as the <HI>Zoophyta,</HI> or Corallines, and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>In order to give a more perfect idea of the na|ture of the&s;e animals, the author holds forth the general analogy between animals and vegetables, principally to &s;hew that the former are not, like the latter, endowed with that multiplicative power of propagating them&s;elves without the particular energy and exertion of the generative function; whereas the <HI>Animalia Compo&s;ita</HI> &s;eem to unite the&s;e powers, &s;ince they not only appear to propagate by <HI>eggs,</HI> or <HI>viva &s;oboles,</HI> but al&s;o by progre&s;&s;ive exten&s;ion and ramification.</P>
<P>The animals of the LITHOPHYTA, like the <HI>Te&s;tacea,</HI> fabricate their own ba&s;e of calcareous
<PB N="311" REF="316">
matter, forming the whole ma&s;s into tubes, each ending on the &s;urface, in pores or cells, according to their &s;pecific difference, where alone the animal &s;eems to dwell, and extending the&s;e habitations progre&s;&s;ively, in the manner of vegetables, leaving the ba&s;e at length to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>The animals of the <HI>Zoophyta,</HI> containing the Corallines, &amp;c. particularly the <HI>fixed</HI> ones, approach much nearer than the foregoing to vegetables, both in their texture and form in general, ari&s;ing as if from a root, and forming a &s;tem and branches, which are be&s;et at the extremities and articulations with the animals, or <HI>Polypes,</HI> appearing by the help of gla&s;&s;es like &s;o many flowers.</P>

<P>In the time of the <HI>Romans</HI> it was a trite proverb, <HI>that Africa was the land of wonders;</HI> and it &s;till re|mains true, as in the&s;e days it affords, both in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;tupendous and &s;ingular productions of nature. From the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> from whence <HI>Europe</HI> has chiefly been furni&s;hed with the plants of <HI>Africa,</HI> their uncommon a&s;pect, &s;o very different from tho&s;e of <HI>Europe,</HI> has attracted the notice, not only of naturali&s;ts, but of all man|kind; and as the mildne&s;s of that climate allowed of their cultivation here, they &s;oon became fa|vourites in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gardens.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="317">
Some of the fir&s;t <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> plants that were brought to <HI>Europe,</HI> we owe to <HI>J. Heurnius,</HI> who &s;ent them to his brother, a profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Ley|den;</HI> and they are figured in <HI>Bodeus &aacute; Stapel's Theo|phra&s;tus,</HI> p. 333; among the&s;e were the Indian Reed, <HI>(Canna Indica),</HI> the <HI>Haemanthus Coccineus, Stapelia,</HI> the <HI>Aletris Uvaria,</HI> and a few others. But the fir&s;t botani&s;t who vi&s;ited the <HI>Cape</HI> was <HI>Paul Herman;</HI> he collected 800 &s;pecies, then unknown in <HI>Europe:</HI> after him <HI>H. B. Oldenland,</HI> a <HI>Dane,</HI> and <HI>J.

From the&s;e materials chiefly the pre&s;ent <HI>Flora</HI> is compo&s;ed, according to the u&s;ual plan, with the <HI>trivial</HI> names only.</P>
<P>Among the plants of the <HI>Cape,</HI> there are 38 <HI>genera</HI> peculiar to that part of the world, &s;everal of which excel all others in the number of &s;pecies, as well as in their uncommon and &s;uperb appearance. The va&s;t number of &s;pecies under the &s;ame genus, &s;o frequently met with in that country, &s;trongly favours the idea of the perpetual new origin of plants; and that many, which el&s;ewhere are only <HI>hybrid,</HI> there propagate and become permanent. But <HI>Caffraria,</HI> beyond all other countries, abounds with exten&s;ive genera of plants: the &s;ucculent kinds, particularly, cover the &s;andy &s;oil, where nothing but the fact could convince us that vege|tation would in any degree &s;ucceed. Such are the

Fig-marygolds, <HI>(Me&s;embryanthema),</HI> Aloes, <HI>Pur&s;|lanes,</HI> &amp;c. Among the others, we are a&s;toni&s;hed with the variety of the <HI>Heaths,</HI> (Ericae), <HI>Gerania, Protaeae,</HI> and <HI>Gnaphalia.</HI></P>
<P>Since the publication of M. <HI>Wannman</HI>'s the&s;is, great di&s;coveries in botany have been made in &s;outhern <HI>Africa</HI> by <HI>Thunberg</HI> and <HI>Sparmann,</HI> and by Mr. <HI>Ma&s;&s;on;</HI> and we have rea&s;on to expect a com|plete account of the plants of that country from Dr. <HI>Laurence Burman,</HI> &s;on of profe&s;&s;or <HI>J.

<HEAD>118. PROLEPSIS PLANTARUM. <HI>H. Ulmark.</HI> 1760.</HEAD>
<P>The theory of vegetation built by <HI>Malpighi</HI> and <HI>Grew,</HI> on the anatomy of plants, and that of <HI>Hales</HI> and others, drawn from what may be called their phy&s;iology, has not been followed in the <HI>Linnaean</HI> &s;chool. LINNAEUS early conceived the idea of an analogy between plants and animals, and &s;peaks of vegetables al&s;o, as con&s;i&s;ting of a <HI>medullary</HI> and <HI>cortical</HI> &s;ub&s;tance, (in the former of which the pro|per life and principle of vegetation re&s;ides, and by which alone it is propagated) con&s;idering the latter as the organs of nouri&s;hment to the former. This idea &s;eems al&s;o to have led him to adopt the opinion of <HI>Cae&s;alpinus,</HI> relating to the evolution of the&s;e two parts, in the order which is mentioned in the 66th the&s;is; namely, that the <HI>Cortex,</HI> or outer Bark, is ultimately &s;pent in forming the <HI>Perianthium,</HI> or Cup of the flower, be&s;ides which, it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved, that the leaves are produced from the cor|tical &s;ub&s;tance only; the <HI>Liber,</HI> or inner Bark, in the Corolla or Petals; the <HI>Lignum,</HI> or woody part,
<PB N="336" REF="341">
in the <HI>Stamina</HI> or Chives; and the <HI>Medulla,</HI> or pithy part, in the <HI>Pi&s;tillum</HI> and Seed.</P>
<P>Principally to confirm and illu&s;trate the&s;e <HI>data</HI> is the de&s;ign of this <HI>the&s;is,</HI> which in fact is a com|ment on a part of the 24th &s;ection of the Introduc|tion to the &s;econd tome of the <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> p. 9, con|taining a conci&s;e view of this doctrine.

As this cannot be &s;o aptly illu&s;trated in annual and other plants, on account of the tender texture, and quick growth, the author endeavours to exemplify it from ob&s;ervations made on the bud-bearing trees; in which he ob&s;erves, that the full evolution of the parts, from the origin of the bud to the expan&s;ion of the flower, as the final act of vegetation in each, is a progre&s;&s;ive work, the ac|compli&s;hment of which requires five or &s;ix years, and that it takes place in the following order: That the <HI>Leaves,</HI> which are unconnected with the <HI>medullary</HI> &s;ub&s;tance, and derive their origin from the <HI>cortical,</HI> are the produce of the fir&s;t year; and in plants and trees that are furni&s;hed with <HI>Bracte,</HI> or floral Leaves, that &s;uch are the i&s;&s;ue of the &s;econd year; and the <HI>Perianthium,</HI> or Cup of the flower, of the third; the <HI>Petals</HI> of the fourth; the <HI>Stamina</HI> of the fifth; and the <HI>Pi&s;til,</HI> &amp;c. of the &s;ixth.

<P>Mr. <HI>Ferber,</HI> who is probably the &s;ame per|&s;on that has publi&s;hed <HI>Phy&s;ico-geographical Tra|vels into Italy,</HI> endeavours, in this paper, as Mr. <HI>Ulmark</HI> hath done, to illu&s;trate and con|firm the theory of vegetation received in the <HI>Up|&s;al</HI> &s;chool.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t treats on the food of plants; which, without entering into any &s;ubtle di&s;qui&s;itions re|lating to its elementary principles and compo&s;ition, is defined to be the watery tincture of the &s;oil, re|ceived by the roots, and tran&s;mitted to the <HI>medullary</HI> by the va&s;cular part of the <HI>cortical</HI> &s;ub&s;tance. He e&s;tabli&s;hes it as a fact, that too great an afflux of nutriment thrown into the <HI>cortical</HI> part, retards the fructification, by compre&s;&s;ing the <HI>medullary.</HI> He
<PB N="338" REF="343">
thinks this is proved by the &s;tate of luxuriant plants in general, and by the effects of depriving them of this &s;uperfluity: on which head he quotes the experiments of Mr. <HI>Fitzgerald,</HI> re|corded in the <HI>Philo&s;. Tran&s;act.</HI> vol. lii. p. 71, as confirming the truth of the theory here ad|vanced.</P>
<P>After having e&s;tabli&s;hed the cortical part as the organ and depo&s;it of nutriment, he proceeds to &s;hew, that <HI>heat alone</HI> excites to action and vigour, the life or protru&s;ive and expan&s;ive force of the medullary part; which is ever &s;pent in propagat|ing the plant, by forming <HI>buds, bulbs,</HI> or <HI>&s;eed,</HI> as its final and mo&s;t perfect i&s;&s;ue: and that this in|tention of nature &s;ucceeds in a proportion equal to the degree of nutriment afforded by the cortical, to that of the heat admini&s;tered to the medullary part re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd chapter, M. <HI>Ferber</HI> treats on the origin and evolution of buds; in which he accedes to the doctrine of the progre&s;&s;ive perfection of them, mentioned in the di&s;&s;ertation ju&s;t reviewed.</P>
<P>The la&s;t chapter is appropriated to the <HI>Involu|tion of Plants</HI> in the Seed, Buds, and Bulbs; in which he a&s;&s;erts, that in the &s;eeds of the <HI>Nymphaea Nelumbo,</HI> the very leaves of the future plant are vi&s;ible. In bulbs the rudiment of the next year's plant is al&s;o con&s;picuous: in like manner buds contain the perfect plant, although the evolution in the&s;e requires a longer proce&s;s.</P>

<P>After &s;ome general phy&s;iological ob&s;ervations on the effects of exerci&s;e, the writer di&s;plays its efficacy as a <HI>pre&s;ervative;</HI> in &s;trengthening the body, procuring the mo&s;t genial warmth, helping dige&s;tion, increa&s;ing per&s;piration, and promoting all the excretions in due time and proportion; in procuring the mo&s;t refre&s;hing &s;leep, and, in vale|tudinary habits particularly, &s;ubduing that fruit|ful &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;e, acidities in the fir&s;t pa&s;|&s;ages.</P>
<P>He then enumerates tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es in which ex|erci&s;e is to be con&s;idered in a <HI>medicinal</HI> view. In hypochondriac ca&s;es, habitual debility, languid appetite, ob&s;tructions of the vi&s;cera, con&s;umptions, a&s;thma, and in various di&s;ea&s;es from laxity, its u&s;e has been indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the <HI>Hemicrania,</HI> he relates that LINNAEUS him&s;elf had been &s;ubject to violent pa|roxy&s;ms of that kind, which u&s;ually held him 24 hours, with intervals rarely of little more than a week; and that the&s;e fits were excited by very &s;light cau&s;es, even &s;uch as the drinking only a &s;poonful of wine: and that after trying ineffectually various

Such a number of plants, &s;o nearly alike in their habit as the&s;e, mu&s;t require numerous &s;ubdivi|&s;ions, and nice di&s;tinctions, to di&s;criminate each &s;pecies. To effect this is the intention of this tract, in which, after &s;ome curious preliminary ob&s;ervations, relating to the &s;tation and u&s;es that nature &s;eems to have a&s;&s;igned to &s;ome particular &s;pecies, and a li&s;t of the common gra&s;&s;es, cla&s;&s;ed according to their native places, the author pre|&s;ents us with an hi&s;torical account of the prin|cipal writers who have treated &s;eparately on this cla&s;s, exhibiting under each a brief view of their &s;y&s;tems of cla&s;&s;ification. The&s;e are <HI>C. Bauhine, Rudbeck, Ray,</HI> and above all, <HI>Scheuchzer,</HI> who with incredible labour has de&s;cribed all the &s;pe|cies.

and habit of a plant of this cla&s;s, intended to con|vey a full explanation of the <HI>terms,</HI> referring to two explanatory plates, on which is engraven a flower of each genus.</P>
<P>Various have been the methods invented to cla&s;s this tribe; our author here gives them a new di&s;|po&s;ition, entirely independent on the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem, e&s;tabli&s;hed on the <HI>figure</HI> and <HI>number</HI> of the valves compo&s;ing the Glume or <HI>Calix;</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>flower,</HI> cla&s;&s;ed under two general heads, as they grow either in the form of <HI>Spikes</HI> or <HI>Panicles.</HI></P>
<P>In all <HI>natural cla&s;&s;es</HI> the di&s;tinctions of the genera depend on minute differences, which require very nice di&s;criminations; the author therefore proceeds to point the&s;e out in &s;everal in&s;tances of this tribe: he has al&s;o added the <HI>exceptions</HI> that ari&s;e under the &s;everal genera in various &s;pecies, an imperfection that attends all &s;y&s;tems.

<P>He next con&s;iders the &s;en&s;ible qualities of <HI>Tea,</HI> its fragrant odour, and &s;typtic ta&s;te; and from its place in the Sy&s;tem, botanically con&s;idered, with re&s;pect to the <HI>natural orders,</HI> he thinks it highly probable, that what <HI>Kaempfer</HI> relates of its <HI>narcotic</HI> quality, when green, is con&s;onant to truth. And, from &s;imilar in&s;tances, he proves that this quality may readily be thrown off by that degree of heat which the &s;udden ex&s;iccation of the leaves require.</P>

That the phy&s;icians at <HI>Ham|burgh, Am&s;terdam,</HI> &amp;c. attribute the frequency of the <HI>Leucorrhaea</HI> among the women of condition to their indulgence in this liquor.

<P>The &s;ubjects of this the&s;is have been much agi|tated of late years by the philo&s;ophical <HI>literati,</HI> who have been &s;killed in the u&s;e of micro&s;copes. It turns principally on the di&s;coveries of the Baron <HI>Munkhau&s;en,</HI> relating to the <HI>&s;mut</HI> of wheat and bar|ley, and to the du&s;t of the <HI>Lycoperda,</HI> or Puff-balls; <HI>Agarics,</HI> and other <HI>Fungi;</HI> which he has a&s;&s;erted to be no other than the <HI>ova</HI> of <HI>animalcula:</HI> from whence had ari&s;en a doubt, whether mu&s;hrooms &s;hould be ranked with vegetables or animals. LINNAEUS adopted, though with great he&s;itation, the Baron's opinion, as appears from his <HI>Sy&s;tema Nat.</HI> p. 1326; but his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject, after the experiments made by our late Mr. <HI>Ellis,</HI> who, at his reque&s;t, in&s;tituted a cour&s;e profe&s;&s;edly to determine this point, do not appear. The re|&s;ult of Mr. <HI>Ellis</HI>'s enquiry proved the negative, as may be &s;een by his papers, publi&s;hed in the <HI>Phil. Tran&s;.</HI> vol. lix. p. 138, and <HI>Gent.

Much curious matter on this &s;ub|ject occurs in Mr. <HI>Roos</HI>'s paper; but we conclude with an important fact, related from the Baron's book, who recommends the &s;eed wheat to be wa&s;hed in a lye made of lime and &s;ea-&s;alt; by which prac|tice, for twenty years, he had &s;ecured his crop from &s;mut, although his neighbours around him had &s;ometimes lo&s;t a third part of theirs.

<P>This ingenious di&s;cour&s;e, written by a young <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> nobleman, a &s;tudent at <HI>Up&s;al,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t entertaining and be&s;t-dige&s;ted papers on the &s;ubject, that this collection affords, and cannot fail to carry conviction with it. It is divided into two parts: in the fir&s;t, he di&s;plays the nece&s;&s;ity of a knowledge of natural hi&s;tory at large, in leading the way to improvements in all branches of agriculture, and in gardening: the utility e&s;pe|cially of being acquainted with the indigenous plants of the country, an object greatly neglected, and which, if more attended to, mu&s;t lead, as he endeavours to &s;hew, to the improvement of woods, hedges, the culture of barren ground, wet mea|dows; to the extirpation of hurtful plants, and the better adapting pa&s;tures to the &s;everal kinds of cattle. To illu&s;trate this latter po&s;ition, he mentions a memorable fact, related by LINNAEUS in the <HI>Iter Scanicum,</HI> of a number of goats which were peri&s;hing in an i&s;land that abounded with the Reed Bent Gra&s;s, <HI>(Agro&s;tis arundinacea)</HI> a plant on which hor&s;es feed with avidity, and thrive

<P>The &s;econd part abounds with curious ob&s;erva|tions concerning the economy of dome&s;ticated ani|mals; in treating on which he points out both the mo&s;t nutritive and noxious herbs to each &s;pecies; de&s;cending afterwards to dome&s;tic fowls, and the inferior parts of the animal creation, which are more particularly the objects of hu&s;bandmen. A plate is added, on which is engraven, together with a rare &s;pecies of <HI>Henbane,</HI> the <HI>Actaea Cimici|fuga,</HI> Sp.

<P>THE &s;cience of botany certainly holds its mo&s;t dignified &s;tation when &s;ub&s;ervient to <HI>medicine;</HI> but its utility does not terminate in this alone, though it has too long been con&s;idered as having no other connection. This, notwith&s;tand|ing, is but a partial, nay even an injurious idea of it, for nothing has more retarded its u&s;efulne&s;s than this contracted notion. It has a relation, in a variety of ways, to many other arts and &s;ciences. Among which may be mentioned the <HI>art of paint|ing and dying;</HI> but of all others <HI>Agriculture</HI> cer|tainly claims the &s;tricte&s;t relation, &s;ome of its mo&s;t important branches being greatly dependent upon it, and others, from an happy application of it, being perhaps capable of further emolument. The &s;ub&s;equent paper, it is pre&s;umed, will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, illu&s;trate this truth. But how&s;oever great the real dignity and importance of this art, yet, it mu&s;t be allowed, that it has not been cultivated &s;ufficiently on &s;cientific principles, nor advanced in equal proportion with other branches of know|ledge. It is not many years &s;ince Dr. <HI>Home</HI> ob|&s;erved,
<PB N="375" REF="380">
that <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Columella,</HI> old as they are, remained almo&s;t the only writers worth con|&s;ulting upon this &s;ubject. The writings of Mr. <HI>Hart,</HI> Dr. <HI>A.

On the continent, the <HI>Swedes</HI> are making large and daily progre&s;s in the im|provement of this branch of <HI>economics.</HI> In <HI>France,</HI> Mr. <HI>Du Hamel</HI> has rendered him&s;elf con&s;picuous by his writings on this &s;ubject; and in various parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;ocieties have been formed with a profe&s;&s;ed view to this end. We cannot help mentioning, with peculiar plea&s;ure, that of <HI>Padua,</HI> over which Dr. <HI>Arduin</HI> pre&s;ides, who, by the mu|nificence of the <HI>Venetian</HI> &s;tate, has a garden allotted for the cultivation of &s;uch vegetables as they wi&s;h to &s;ubject to experiments in agriculture, dyeing, and other arts.

<P>Amid&s;t that almo&s;t infinite variety of vegetables, with which the beneficent hand of nature has re|pleni&s;hed our earth, tho&s;e which go under the general name of <HI>Gra&s;&s;es</HI> form the principal food of our cattle; next to the&s;e, among the <HI>natural cla&s;&s;es</HI> of plants, none are more acceptable than the

<HI>diadelphous</HI> or leguminous herbs: of this cla&s;s is the <HI>Clover,</HI> &s;o much cultivated in <HI>England;</HI> the <HI>Saint Foin,</HI> or <HI>Cocks-head;</HI> and the <HI>Lucern,</HI> or Medic|fodder, in <HI>France.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e, our hor&s;es, horned cattle, &s;heep, &amp;c. will all, in their turn, eat with equal plea&s;ure, and &s;ome with more avi|dity, a great variety of other vegetables. Nume|rous in&s;tances occur where one &s;pecies of animals will feed greedily upon tho&s;e herbs which others refu&s;e to touch, and will even almo&s;t fami&s;h rather than eat. Some plants are highly noxious, and even poi&s;onous, to certain kinds of animals, while they are eaten by others without the lea&s;t &s;ub&s;equent ill effect: to in&s;tance, the <HI>Cicuta Viro&s;a,</HI> or long|leaved Water Hemlock, the mo&s;t virulent plant which grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly in <HI>England,</HI> (but hap|pily is not common) is fatal to cows, when, through &s;carcity of food, they are obliged to eat it; yet &s;heep and hor&s;es feed on it with impunity, and goats even greedily devour it.</P>

Facts of this kind mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, have been obvious to the mo&s;t incurious of mankind, even in the earlie&s;t ages. The fir&s;t race of &s;hep|herds had daily in&s;tances, among their flocks, of the &s;election and refu&s;al of particular herbs, and &s;ub&s;equent ob&s;ervations mu&s;t have multiplied and confirmed them. But they were &s;till only known in the general, and no <HI>experiments</HI> had been in&s;ti|tuted to a&s;certain the <HI>preci&s;e &s;pecies</HI> thus eaten or
<PB N="377" REF="382">
rejected. The facts are, at this time, undeniable. It is well known that <HI>Flag-flowers, Hounds-tongue, Henbane, Mullein, Night&s;hade, Hemlock,</HI> &s;everal <HI>Docks, Ar&s;mart, Agrimony, Celandine,</HI> &s;everal <HI>Crowfoots, Mar&s;h Marigold, Horehound, Figwort,</HI> many <HI>Thi&s;tles, Fern,</HI> and other plants, are commonly neglected by our hor&s;es, and horned cattle, and &s;tand un|touched, even in pa&s;tures where it might be ex|pected that nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould con&s;train them to eat any thing. The&s;e are but a few out of many in|&s;tances; there are more than is commonly imagin|ed, and it was de&s;irable, in con&s;equence of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, that a cour&s;e of experiments &s;hould be in&s;tituted to elucidate this in&s;tinct, in that part e&s;pecially of the brute creation which is &s;o imme|diately &s;ub&s;ervient to mankind. The utility of &s;uch experiments mu&s;t be evident, as they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily lay the foundation of farther improve|ments in the economy of cattle. The intelligent hu&s;bandman would, by this means, have it in his power to rid his pa&s;tures of noxious and u&s;ele&s;s plants, and give room for the &s;alubrious ones.</P>
<P>In this view of the affair, it will be &s;een that phy&s;icians are not the only per&s;ons who may &s;tudy botany to advantage; many others would find, not only a fund of plea&s;ure from this &s;tudy, but numberle&s;s other advantages re&s;ulting from the knowledge of the plants of their own country. In the in&s;tance before us, &s;cience has opened the way, and &s;urely it is not too much to &s;ay, that it evi|dently points to greater improvements, in one of the mo&s;t important branches of agriculture, as it relates to the economy of cattle. More than this
<PB N="378" REF="383">
ought not to be expected from its aid. It is to the intelligent grazier and the gentleman, well ver&s;ed in the knowledge of the <HI>indigenous</HI> plants, fraught with careful ob&s;ervation, and practi&s;ed in the eco|nomy of cattle, that the re&s;t mu&s;t be owing. No|thing but the want of this knowledge, in &s;uch gentlemen as re&s;ide in the country chiefly, can de|prive us of the benefit which might otherwi&s;e ac|crue from reducing it into practice. The eradi|cating from pa&s;tures poi&s;onous and u&s;ele&s;s weeds, would be but one, although indeed no mean one, among many other advantages. Further than this, the hu&s;bandman would be better enabled to &s;uit his &s;everal &s;orts of cattle to the different pa&s;|tures in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, more to their benefit, and con&s;equently his own. Even in mar&s;hy grounds, where it is a difficult undertaking to mend the &s;oil, the growth of many plants might be encouraged, and the &s;eeds of others &s;own, which are highly acceptable to different kinds of cattle. By degrees too we &s;hould undoubtedly be led to the cultivation of other vegetables be&s;ides <HI>clover,</HI> as fodder; and the foregoing ob&s;ervations imply, that this might be done in &s;oils and &s;itua|tions where that would not thrive. Our hay would in con&s;equence be much improved; for al|though cattle will eat tho&s;e herbs among hay, which they reject while green and growing, yet it does not follow that all are in their dried &s;tate equally nutritive and whole&s;ome. The benefits, in fine, which would ari&s;e from a diligent and general pur&s;uit of the&s;e hints, would undoubtedly be vari|ous and exten&s;ive, and many more, in all probabi|lity,
<PB N="379" REF="384">
in a cour&s;e of years, than can at pre&s;ent be thought of.</P>
<P>Agreeably to the&s;e ideas, a beginning has been made, under the au&s;pices of our celebrated author, who&s;e attempt was truly laudable, and worthy of him&s;elf. To this end, it is indeed certainly the province of the botani&s;t to make the plants of his own country the principal objects of his atten|tion. This has been eminently the ca&s;e with LIN|NAEUS, and his country will continue to reap the fruit of his labours. The re&s;ult of the&s;e experi|ments may be &s;een in a paper, called PAN SUECUS, printed in the &s;econd volume of the <HI>Amoenitates Academicae,</HI> the &s;ub&s;tance of which, &s;o far as the experiments were made with plants common to this country, will be exhibited in the &s;ub&s;equent pages.</P>
<P>LINNAEUS conceived the fir&s;t de&s;ign of this in|&s;titution from ob&s;ervations made in his <HI>Dalekarlian</HI> journey, which has been mentioned in the cour&s;e of the preceding pages: he ob&s;erved, that his hor&s;es left untouched, among other plants, <HI>Mea|dow-&s;weet, Great Wild Valerian, Lilly of the Valley, Angelica, Ro&s;e-bay Willow Herb, Mar&s;h Cinquefoil, Mountain Crowfoot Crane's-bill, Globe Crowfoot,</HI> and various &s;hrubs. It was not till &s;everal years after, that the&s;e experiments were in&s;tituted; in which a number of his pupils were engaged; eight or nine of whom he mentions by name, and he had him&s;elf a large &s;hare in directing and conducting them. More than two thou&s;and experiments were tried upon the <HI>horned cattle, goats, &s;heep, hor&s;es,</HI> and <HI>hogs:</HI> many were repeated ten, and &s;ome twenty
<PB N="380" REF="385">
times, with the &s;ole view of determining what vegetables the&s;e &s;everal animals would eat or re|ject. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that numberle&s;s difficulties mu&s;t ari&s;e in the pro&s;ecution of this &s;cheme, and that imperfection, in a variety of in&s;tances, mu&s;t at la&s;t attend their greate&s;t accuracy. In the mean time, care was taken, as far as circum&s;tances would admit, that the experiments were made as unexceptionably as po&s;&s;ible; and it mu&s;t be con|cluded, that the re&s;ult upon the whole is true, as they have a real foundation in tho&s;e unerring laws of in&s;tinct, to which nature has &s;ubjected the whole brute creation. The plants were all fre&s;h gather|ed, not brui&s;ed in collecting, nor offered to the cattle when they were either almo&s;t fami&s;hed, or glutted with variety; nor yet in the &s;pring-time, when many of them greedily devour almo&s;t any vegetable they can get, &s;ometimes &s;uch as are fatal to them, and which at other times they will not touch. The plants were al&s;o, in many examples, offered to &s;everal individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The&s;e trials were made only with the indigenous plants of <HI>Sweden,</HI> which are (at lea&s;t three fourths) the &s;ame as ours in <HI>England.</HI> The plants growing &s;pontaneou&s;ly in <HI>Sweden,</HI> exclu&s;ive of the mo&s;&s;es and fungu&s;es, amount to about 900 &s;pecies. Of &s;uch a number, in every country, many mu&s;t be very rare; it is not therefore to be expected that all the&s;e could be brought to trial. Some, although plentiful in one part of the country, would be very &s;paringly found in another. From the re&s;ult it appeared, that the <HI>horned cattle</HI> eat of the plants which were offered to them&punc; only 276 &s;pecies, and

that they rejected 218. The <HI>goats,</HI> of 449 kinds, refu&s;ing 126. The <HI>&s;heep,</HI> of 387, refu&s;ing 141. The <HI>hor&s;es,</HI> of 262 &s;pecies, refu&s;ing 212. And of tho&s;e which were offered to <HI>&s;wine,</HI> they eat 72 kinds, and refu&s;ed 171.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Suecus,</HI> it may be pre&s;umed, is but in few hands, at lea&s;t of &s;uch whom the &s;ubject mo&s;t concerns. It is written in Latin, and put into the mo&s;t compendious form imaginable, by in&s;erting only the <HI>trivial</HI> names of the plants, and referring to the number in the <HI>Flora Suecica,</HI> where the &s;y|nonyms are given. In this form it is almo&s;t u&s;e|le&s;s to per&s;ons unacquainted with LINNAEUS'S writ|ings, and from an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reader is entirely hid. It appeared of importance enough to be thrown into an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> dre&s;s, to which end it was nece&s;&s;ary to give it a form different from the original.</P>
<P>So far as the trials were made with plants which are common to both countries, the re&s;ult may be &s;een in the following pages, and they amount to no very incon&s;iderable number. Being taken <HI>nearly</HI> in the order in which they &s;tood in the original paper, &s;o the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem is of cour&s;e pre&s;erved. Yet perhaps a more apt di&s;po&s;ition of them might have been given, by arranging them according to their u&s;ual places of growth.</P>
<P>In order to render it more generally intelligible and acceptable, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> name of the plant is fir&s;t given, then the <HI>Linnaean</HI> generical and trivial name, by which it may in&s;tantly be found, either in LINNAEUS'S own works, or in Mr. <HI>Hud|&s;on's Flora Anglica.</HI> To the&s;e follow three columns. The fir&s;t contains the reference to the page in Dr.
<PB N="382" REF="387">
<HI>Hill</HI>'s <HI>Briti&s;h Herbal,</HI> which it may be pre&s;umed is in many hands, and which has now &s;uper&s;eded, in a great mea&s;ure, the <HI>Herbals</HI> of <HI>Gerard</HI> and <HI>Perkin&s;on,</HI> being better accommodated to the purpo&s;es of bo|tanic intelligence, and furni&s;hed al&s;o with figures. The &s;econd column refers to the page in RAY'S <HI>Synop&s;is of Briti&s;h Plants,</HI> where the &s;ynonyms of the two <HI>Bauhines,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Gerard</HI> and <HI>Parkin&s;on,</HI> are quoted. By this means the reader is very compendiou&s;ly directed to a variety of authors on each plant. For the &s;ake of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;ee an accurate figure, a reference to the <HI>Flora Danica</HI> is added, a work coming out at the expence of the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and intended to contain all the indigenous plants of that kingdom, of which 840 plates are already done. Of the&s;e above 500 are natives of this kingdom, on which account it &s;upplies, &s;o far, the want of a work of the &s;ame kind here. It mu&s;t, however, be ob&s;erved, that in this column, under the <HI>Gra&s;&s;es,</HI> tho&s;e excellent tables in <HI>Mori&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;toria</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On this head it is much to be regretted, that the&s;e tables are not republi&s;hed &s;eparately, with the hi&s;tory of the <HI>Gra&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Grain</HI> annexed; a work which, if executed by a proper hand, could not but be acceptable to all lovers of rural economy. This view might be rendered &s;till more complete, by extending it to <HI>all</HI> tho&s;e plants which are par|ticularly the objects of this paper.</NOTE><HI>Plantarum Oxonien&s;is</HI> are referred to. The columns on the other page contain the re&s;ult of the experiments, for brevity's &s;ake expre&s;&s;ed as in the original, by nu|merical characters, which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate. There is a column retained for every
<PB N="383" REF="388">
&s;pecies of animals with which the experiments were made in <HI>Sweden;</HI> for, although <HI>goats</HI> are not &s;o commonly kept with us, as in that country, yet it will at lea&s;t be matter of entertainment, if not of utility, to &s;ee what choice of vegetables they will make.</P>
<P>When this figure (1) is made u&s;e of, it denotes that the plant is eaten by that animal to which the column is appropriated; <HI>(O.)</HI> horned cattle or <HI>Oxen; (G.) Goats; (Sh.) Sheep; (H.) Hor&s;es; (S.) Swine.</HI> Two units, thus (11) denote that the ani|mal is very fond of the plant. When the cypher (0) occurs, we are to under&s;tand that the plant is rejected by that animal. When both are found together in a column, thus (10), or (01), they denote that it was &s;ometimes eaten and &s;ometimes rejected: the former is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ignify, that it was generally eaten, but &s;ometimes refu&s;ed; the latter, the rever&s;e. Where no figure occurs, it is to be under&s;tood that no opportunity had been taken of making a trial of that plant upon tho&s;e animals. The native place of each plant is added, and the month in which it flowers, in as compen|dious a manner as po&s;&s;ible, as this &s;eemed to be a requi&s;ite addition; al&s;o its duration, whether an|nual <HI>(A.),</HI> biennial <HI>(B.),</HI> or perennial <HI>(P.).</HI> To the whole are collected and &s;ubjoined, from the la&s;t edition of the <HI>Flora Suecica,</HI> the <HI>Flora Oeconomica,</HI> RAY'S <HI>Hi&s;toria Plantarum,</HI> HALLER'S <HI>Enumeratio Stirpium Helvetiae,</HI> and others, a few notes, point|ing out particularly the noxious plants, or directing the reader's ob&s;ervation to any other article that &s;eemed worthy of regard.</P>

<P><HI>Diadelphous Plants.</HI> A general view of this cla&s;s &s;hews at once how very acceptable they are to almo&s;t all cattle.
