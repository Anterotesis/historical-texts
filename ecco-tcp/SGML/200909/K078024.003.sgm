<P><PB N="2" REF="4">We have &s;everal &s;pecies of the Papilio tribe, which are highly valued in England either for their beauty or &s;carcity; the <HI>P.

<P>The upper &s;ide is only a plain orange or brown colour, with &s;pots of &s;trong black, and does not in general appearance differ materially from the grea&s;y Fritillary Butterfly, which is very common in mo&s;t &s;ituations; but the under&s;ide is entirely unlike every other Engli&s;h In&s;ect: the bright &s;ilver &s;pla&s;hes on the under wings are &s;ingular in their form, and &s;o beautifully relieved by the orange ground colour, and variegation of black between, as to form a delightful contra&s;t of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing colours.</P>
<P>Whether this &s;pecies was originally a native of this country, may be doubtful; we certainly have the mo&s;t re&s;pectable te&s;timonies of its being taken alive in different parts of the kingdom, but it might have been introduced by accident in the larva, or more probably in the pupa &s;tate: it has been &s;een at <HI>Bath;</HI> and either <HI>Mo&s;es Harris,</HI> or &s;ome of his friends, bred it from the caterpillar.

<P>The Linnaean de&s;cription of the <HI>Curculio Betulae,</HI> &s;o nearly corre|&s;ponds with that of <HI>C. Populi,</HI> that if we allow for the variation of colour to which all In&s;ects are &s;ubject, a line can &s;carcely be drawn between the two &s;pecies; the mo&s;t material di&s;tinction is the under&s;ide of <HI>C. Betulae</HI> being of the &s;ame colour as the back; but the under&s;ide of <HI>C. Populi</HI> is purple, and &s;maller.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">The de&s;cription which <HI>Linnaeus</HI> has given of our &s;pecies is, <Q>longi|ro&s;tris, corpore viridi aurato &s;ubtus concolore;</Q> and <HI>Degeer</HI> has de|&s;cribed it in &s;imilar words.

<P><HI>Geoffroy</HI> &s;ays, <HI>"Rhinomacer</HI> totus viridi coeruleus;" and <HI>Fabricius</HI> adds, <Q>Variat &s;aepius colore omnino coeruleo. Alter &s;exus thoracem antror&s;um &s;pino&s;um gerit.</Q> How tho&s;e different de&s;criptions may be reconciled, &s;o as to be de&s;criptive of the two &s;exes of <HI>C. Betulae,</HI> will appear more clearly on farther ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Late in <HI>May,</HI> this &s;ea&s;on, being at <HI>Darent-Wood, Dartford,</HI> I met with one of the green kind, and one of a dark blue colour, with a &s;hade of green on the elytra; I could not be deceived, they were male and female; as a farther corroboration, I met with a &s;econd pair, in a &s;imilar &s;ituation; and on the day following a third: the blue one of this la&s;t pair had not the &s;hade of green as on the former, but was of a rich glo&s;&s;y blue purple; and I am greatly mi&s;taken if it is not the <HI>C. Purpureus</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> or the In&s;ect which is arranged in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cabinets for that &s;pecies.</P>
<P>I communicated the circum&s;tance of meeting with tho&s;e two In&s;ects, which have always been con&s;idered as di&s;tinct kinds, to a per&s;on who al&s;o was collecting In&s;ects in the wood, on the &s;ame day, and he in|formed me that he had ju&s;t before di&s;covered them in the &s;ame &s;ituation. I have examined them very carefully, but cannot di&s;cover any &s;pines on the thorax of the green and gold kind, though I have five of them, but the three purple &s;pecimens are all &s;pinous, as de&s;cribed by authors. I am of opinion, that the bright coloured &s;pecimens are all <HI>females,</HI> and tho&s;e which are purple, I imagine, are <HI>males.</HI></P>
<P>I mentioned the circum&s;tance to an eminent Entomologi&s;t, and he at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected they might be mule In&s;ects, generated between the
<PB N="5" REF="8">
<HI>C. Betulae</HI> and the <HI>C. Purpureus,</HI> but that could not be the ca&s;e, as they were all in copulation when taken.</P>
<P>We have been the more minute in this account, as we con&s;ider the confounding of one &s;pecies with another &s;hould ever be avoided, with as much care as the &s;eparation of varieties into di&s;tinct &s;pecies; both tend to confu&s;e, or &s;ubvert that truth which &s;hould be the guide of every enquirer into nature.</P>
<P>I have received a letter from my re&s;pectable friend <HI>T. Mar&s;ham,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Sec. L. S. accompanied with a &s;pecimen of the green kind of <HI>C. Betulae,</HI> that is &s;pinous on the thorax; together with one of the blue or purple kind, which is &s;pinous al&s;o: he informs me, that though his purple &s;pecimen has &s;pines, he is very certain he has had one with|out; hence it appears to me that they admit of great variation; indeed it would afford the mo&s;t pre&s;umptive argument, that there are males and females of both colours. Among the purple &s;pecimens which I took, there was a con&s;iderable difference in their colours, but of the five green &s;pecimens &s;carcely two exactly agreed; one in particular partook &s;o much of a vivid crim&s;on that it might ea&s;ily have been mi&s;taken by a cur&s;ory collector for the <HI>Curculio Bachus.</HI></P>

<P>We are happy to pre&s;ent our Sub&s;cribers with the figure of a Moth which is &s;carcely known among the Engli&s;h Collectors, and we may venture to a&s;&s;ert on the be&s;t authority has not a place in any cabinet of In&s;ects in this metropolis, except that of the Author; indeed the only per&s;on who appears to have been &s;o fortunate as to meet with it except him&s;elf, is Mr. Lewin, who formerly re&s;ided at Dartford; he con&s;idered it as &s;uch an invaluable rarity, that had not a figure of it been di&s;covered in <HI>Roe&s;el,</HI> it would no doubt have been publi&s;hed in the Tran&s;actions of the Linnaean Society; it mu&s;t, however, be ob|&s;erved, that the In&s;ect <HI>Roe&s;el</HI> has figured is a foreign &s;pecimen.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="14">On the communication of Mr. JONES, of <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> we pre&s;ume that this In&s;ect was formerly known among the Engli&s;h Collectors, and received from them the appellation <HI>Fe&s;toon Moth,</HI> but it mu&s;t have been extremely rare even at that time, as it does not appear in Harris's Li&s;t of Engli&s;h Moths, nor has a &s;ingle &s;pecimen, or its remains, been found among the old Collections, which have been handed down to the Entomologi&s;ts of the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>On the 16th of Augu&s;t, 1793, I &s;hook the Caterpillar from one of the high branches of an oak-tree, in Darent wood, Kent; it remained motionle&s;s for &s;ome time when in the net, and I concluded that it might have &s;u&s;tained an injury by its fall; but I &s;oon after di&s;covered that it was naturally a &s;luggi&s;h, inactive creature, and had received no da|mage; it remained &s;everal days in the Caterpillar &s;tate, but as it was almo&s;t ready to change into Chry&s;alis, I had only an opportunity of being convinced that oak was its proper food.</P>
<P>This Caterpillar is a mo&s;t &s;ingular creature; at one time it would flatten it&s;elf, and be con&s;iderably extended in breadth, or length; at another time it would gather it&s;elf up like an hedge-hog, or become almo&s;t round, and in a few minutes after it would be flat again; and frequently the orange colour on the back would be obliterated; &s;ome|times it &s;o nearly re&s;embled the Caterpillars of &s;everal of the Papilio tribe, that I &s;u&s;pected it to be one of the <HI>Hair-&s;treak Butterflies,</HI> or rather the Caterpillar of a new &s;pecies. On the 23d of Augu&s;t it began to &s;pin, and in a &s;hort time after its ca&s;e was completed.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e in which it pa&s;&s;ed to the Pupa &s;tate, was very firmly con|&s;tructed, and precluded an opportunity of ob&s;erving the different &s;ymptoms of change, which would otherwi&s;e have been vi&s;ible. This ca&s;e, which was exactly in the form of an egg, was at fir&s;t of a pale fle&s;h colour, but in the cour&s;e of a few days it had heightened to a very fine &s;anguineous, and after to a &s;carlet, or nearly vermilion co|lour; this colour it retained for &s;everal months, but as the time for the emancipation of the Moth within approached, the brightne&s;s of
<PB N="11" REF="15">
red &s;omewhat abated, though even after the Fly came forth, much of the original colour remained.</P>
<P>The manner in which it bur&s;ts open the ca&s;e is rather &s;ingular; it does not force an opening in an irregular form, as mo&s;t In&s;ects which &s;pin a ca&s;e, but de&s;cribes an exact circle within at one end; after this it divides its ca&s;e according to that circle, only leaving a &s;mall portion to act as an hinge; when it has extricated it&s;elf from the Chry&s;alis, it forces the top of the ca&s;e back, as &s;hown in our Figure, and thereby a free pa&s;&s;age is opened for its delivery.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide of the ca&s;e is perfectly &s;mooth, and appears as if po|li&s;hed by art; it is of a pale blue colour, the Chry&s;alis within is brown.</P>
<P>The Fly came forth on the 12th of July, 1794.</P>

and expanding at the &s;ummit into a number of &s;hoots, in the form of a cre&s;t: &s;everal other tufts are di&s;per&s;ed near the extremities of the upper wings, but they are not con&s;picuous to the naked eye.</P>
<P>I have &s;een an In&s;ect which corre&s;ponds in every re&s;pect with this &s;pecimen, except that it had a line of a dull ochre colour along the po&s;terior margins of the upper wings; but I &s;u&s;pect it to be either a variety, or perhaps only the difference of &s;ex.</P>
<P><HI>Linnaeus</HI> has not de&s;cribed this in&s;ect, neither can we di&s;cover any de&s;cription of it in the writings of <HI>Fabricius;</HI> and I have no doubt of its being a nonde&s;cript &s;pecies.</P>

<P><PB N="26" REF="34">The Pupa is marked with a brown colour at every annulation im|mediately after the Caterpillar has pa&s;&s;ed to that &s;tate, but as the crea|ture within becomes more perfect, that brown is gradually changed to a dark, or black colour.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved much variation in the colours of different &s;pecimens of this &s;pecies; of three male In&s;ects which I have bred this &s;ea&s;on, one only corre&s;ponded with the annexed figure, one inclined much more to a red brown, and the other to a dull purple.</P>
<P>I met with the Caterpillars on the oak, and they always preferred that food to any other. The Caterpillars are &s;mall in July, they pa&s;s to the Pupa &s;tate in Autumn, and the Moths are to be taken about the middle of March.</P>
<P>Although, as we have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, this In&s;ect does not particularly claim our regard as a rarity, it does not appear to have been de&s;cribed by <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> or even by <HI>Fabricius</HI> in his Species In&s;ectorum; and no account of it is included in Berkenhout's Outlines, in Harris's Cata|logue of Engli&s;h In&s;ects, or any other work we have had an opportu|nity of peru&s;ing.</P>
<P>In its manners, the Caterpillar is not more &s;ingular than in its form; when young it is very active and in continual motion; but as it grows larger it becomes more &s;luggi&s;h in its di&s;po&s;ition: it will &s;ome|times affix it&s;elf by its hind feet to one of the extreme branches of the tree on which it feeds, in the &s;ame manner as &s;hewn in our plate, and will remain in that po&s;ture &s;everal hours without the lea&s;t apparent &s;igns of life.</P>

<P><PB N="46" REF="58">The Papilio Antiopa is found in every part of Europe; in Germany particularly it is very common; it is as frequent in America as in Europe, and is e&s;teemed as a rarity only in this country: it is, indeed, &s;ometimes found in abundance with us, but as its appearance is neither annual nor periodical, it is generally valued by Engli&s;h Collectors.</P>
<P>There have been &s;everal in&s;tances of this In&s;ect being found in different parts of the country in mild &s;ea&s;ons, as plenty as the Pea|cock, or Admirable, Butterflies; in the &s;ummer of 1793 particularly, they were as numerous in &s;ome places as the common garden White Butterfly is u&s;ually near London.</P>
<P>But as a proof that its appearance does not altogether depend on the temperature of the weather, we need only adduce, that not a &s;ingle &s;pecimen has been taken this &s;ea&s;on, although it has been one of the mo&s;t favourable for all kinds of In&s;ects that can be recollected; and many &s;pecies of Moths and Butterflies, which have not been &s;een for &s;everal years before, have been taken at Combe-Wood, Darn-Wood, and &s;imilar adjacent parts, during &s;ummer, in plenty.</P>
<P>It is from the uncertainty of its appearance that we have &s;uch dif|ferent, and, &s;eemingly, irreconcileable accounts of the abundance and &s;carcity of this Butterfly; it was certainly well known as a native of this country to former Collectors, yet it received only a few years &s;ince the new name <HI>Grand Surpri&s;e;</HI> this name, which was given by Mo&s;es Harris, or by &s;ome of the company of Aurelians, of who&s;e &s;ociety he was a member, was evidently intended as a &s;ignificant expre&s;&s;ion of their admiration, not of the beauty of the In&s;ect, but of the &s;ingular circum&s;tance of the &s;pecies remaining &s;o long in tho&s;e very places where the mo&s;t diligent re&s;earches of preceding Collectors had been made in vain; of their unwearied indu&s;try they were well per&s;uaded, and were therefore unable to account for the appearance of a numerous brood of large In&s;ects, which mu&s;t have remained concealed many years, or been lately tran&s;ported to tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>Harris, in his Aurelian, calls it the Camberwell Beauty, though in his li&s;t of Engli&s;h Butterflies Hawk-Moths, and Moths, he u&s;es the name <HI>Grand Surpri&s;e:</HI> we mention this circum&s;tance, as it appears very incon&s;i&s;tent that the new name he adopts in one work, and the
<PB N="47" REF="59">
old one he &s;hould have di&s;carded in the other, are equally and indi&s;|criminately u&s;ed in the &s;everal editions of both; we &s;till find it in the Aurelian, <HI>"Camberwell Beauty,"</HI> in the other, <HI>"Grand Surpri&s;e,"</HI> from which it might be readily inferred, that he meant two di&s;tinct In&s;ects, were it not for the addition of the Linnaean name <HI>Pap. Antiopa.</HI></P>
<P>In the general de&s;cription of this In&s;ect in the Aurelian, Harris does not &s;ay that it was &s;carce at that time (1775), which he certainly would if it had been &s;o; but Berkenhout, in his outlines of Natural Hi&s;tory, (1789) adds, after its &s;pecific character, that it is <Q>very rare in this kingdom.</Q> To reconcile tho&s;e accounts, we can only ob|&s;erve, that no In&s;ect is more uncertain as to the time of its appear|ance; that though found in abundance in one &s;ea&s;on, it may not be &s;een in the next, or even for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years; it will then ap|pear in &s;mall or large quantities, for one, two, or more &s;ea&s;ons, and again di&s;appear for many years as before.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h &s;pecimens differ from tho&s;e of other countries in the colour of the light exterior border of the wings; in the former, that part is of a very pale yellow brown, inclining to a dirty white; in the latter, it is of a deep yellow, marked and &s;potted with brown. <HI>Fabri|cius</HI> notices this difference, and &s;ays they are varieties.</P>
<P>The Caterpillars feed on the Willow, and are generally found on the highe&s;t branches; they ca&s;t their &s;kin early in <HI>July,</HI> and pa&s;s to the Chry&s;alis, as repre&s;ented in the plate. The under&s;ide of the But|terfly is of a black brown, with irregular dark &s;treaks; the yellowi&s;h border is vi&s;ible on that &s;ide.</P>

<P><PB N="52" REF="66">The Sphinx Euphorbiae, con&s;idered as a native of this country, is without exception the rare&s;t &s;pecies of the genus we have: and if we omit the Sp. Porcellus, Lineata, Atropos, with a very few others, we have no indigenous &s;pecies that can by any means be compared with it as a rare, or, we may add, beautiful In&s;ect.</P>
<P><HI>Drury</HI> has given a figure of the Sphinx without its changes among his rare In&s;ects, but as a native of a foreign country: and before the time of <HI>Harris</HI> it was frequently an object of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion among Aure|lians, whether it ever had been taken in <HI>England; Harris</HI> in his work, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus, <Q>It has been long in di&s;pute whether the Spotted Elephant was a native of this i&s;land; but it is now pa&s;t a doubt, as I have had the good fortune to find a Caterpillar of this Moth in mar&s;hy ground at <HI>Barn&s;cray,</HI> near <HI>Crayford</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> about the middle of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1778.</NOTE>; it was better than three inches long, of a dark brown colour; the horn at the tail part, which was about half an inch long, appeared long and glo&s;&s;y. The head was nearly the &s;ize of a &s;mall pea, of a lighti&s;h yellow, brown, or tan colour. I tried various herbs to bring it to feed, but my attempts were fruit|le&s;s, and it died for want <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It &s;eeds on plants of the <HI>Euphorbia</HI> genus, as its &s;pecific name indicates.</NOTE>. The Chry&s;alis in the plate was &s;ent me from <HI>Bellei&s;le</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> and the Moth was produced from it about the beginning of <HI>June.</HI></Q>&mdash;<HI>Harris</HI>'s <HI>Aurelian,</HI> plate 44.</P>
<P>We are not informed of more than two &s;imilar circum&s;tances that may place its exi&s;tence in this country beyond di&s;pute; a damaged &s;pecimen of the Fly has been taken at <HI>Bath,</HI> and is in our cabinet; and Mr. <HI>Curtis,</HI> author of the <HI>Flora Londinen&s;is,</HI> &amp;c. found four of the Caterpillars la&s;t &s;ummer in <HI>Devon&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>In the Caterpillar &s;tate it frequently changes its &s;kin, and appears as frequently to alter its appearance; we cannot el&s;e account for the di&s;&s;imilarity that prevails among all the coloured repre&s;entations of the In&s;ect in that &s;tate that have come under our in&s;pection; in Roe&s;el's Hi&s;t. In&s;. we find a figure of the Caterpillar apparently in the la&s;t &s;kin,
<PB N="53" REF="67">
that very nearly corre&s;ponds with our &s;pecimen; but that figured by Harris does not agree with either, in the form or number of the &s;pots. At an early &s;tage of its growth the Caterpillar, according to Roe&s;el, is bright yellow, with black patches, and minute white &s;pecks.</P>
<P>The figure in plate XCII. is copied from a mo&s;t perfect &s;pecimen of the Caterpillar, and which is now in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but as we cannot a&s;&s;ure our Sub&s;cribers that it was found in <HI>England,</HI> we have been careful to add it in a &s;eparate plate, that &s;o it may either be in|cluded in the volume with the Sphinx and Pupa, or be excluded with propriety.</P>

<P><PB N="62" REF="76">The Caterpillar of the Ph. Neu&s;tria are found in June, either on the white-thorn, black-thorn, or briar; &s;ometimes on fruit trees: they pa&s;s to the Chry&s;alis &s;tate in July, and the Moths appear in Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>The female depo&s;its her eggs with &s;uch particular care and regu|larity, that a clu&s;ter of them forms one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing objects for micro&s;copical inve&s;tigation; they are cru&s;taceous, of a light grey or blui&s;h colour, elegantly marked at the broade&s;t end; they are di&s;po&s;ed with the greate&s;t &s;ymmetry around the &s;mall branches of the thorn, and are &s;o cemented together that they cannot readily be &s;eparated.&mdash;The appearance of a clu&s;ter is repre&s;ented in our plate.</P>
<P>The eggs are laid in autumn, though they are not hatched till the en&s;uing &s;pring. When the young Caterpillars bur&s;t forth, they form into &s;ocieties, &s;ometimes of thirty or forty individuals, &s;ometimes of a much greater number; they immediately commence the formation of a &s;pacious web, and if the weather be fine in two or three days, their work is completed; as however they encrea&s;e in bulk, it is nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge their dwelling, and this they manage either by adding new external coverings, or encrea&s;ing and extending the windings within. They &s;eldom pa&s;s to the Pupa form in tho&s;e ne&s;ts, but &s;eparate in &s;earch of a more convenient place for that purpo&s;e when they have attained their full &s;ize.</P>
<P>The Caterpillar, when preparing for its next &s;tate, weaves a large &s;ilky ca&s;e; within which it forms another &s;omewhat &s;maller; and thus enveloped by its double cone, it changes to the Pupa form. The Pupa is black, and may be ju&s;t di&s;cerned through the two ca&s;es, as re|pre&s;ented in our plate.</P>

<P>June 10th, 1794.&mdash;I found one &s;pecimen in the larva &s;tate at Coombe-wood, Surrey; it was lurking beneath a branch of hazel, among &s;ome &s;mall Caterpillars that had formed a &s;light web on the leaves; as it was only &s;erved with vegetable food when confined in the breeding cage, it died in a few days.</P>
<P>June 26th, 1794.&mdash;I &s;hook another &s;pecimen from the upper branches of a tall oak in Darn-wood, Dartford. At fir&s;t it refu&s;ed to eat, but &s;hortly after I ob&s;erved it &s;u&s;pended acro&s;s a leaf, with its head downward, and its ro&s;trum extended and transfixed through the head of a &s;mall Caterpillar which had unfortunately &s;trayed into the box. I fed it after with dead worms, hou&s;e flies, &amp;c. from which it extracted nutritive moi&s;ture, and encrea&s;ed con&s;iderably in bulk.&mdash; June 29th it ca&s;t its exuviae&mdash;July the 2d. it ca&s;t another, when the perfect In&s;ect came forth: the larva can &s;carcely be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the pupa &s;tate.</P>

<P>The Caterpillars of this Moth feed on the White and Black Thorn, together with &s;everal herbaceous plants; it has been ob&s;erved to thrive better in the breeding cage when regularly &s;upplied with fre&s;h gra&s;s, to keep the former in a proper &s;tate of moi&s;ture.</P>

<P>In Plate LXXXVIII. of this work I gave a figure of the Small Apis Lapidaria, Red-tail Bee, which is well known as a native of this country; but declined including a figure of the large&s;t kind, until I could affirm on credible authority it had been taken in England al&s;o.</P>
<P>I have lately had the good fortune to be &s;atisfied in this particular; LORD WILLIAM SEYMOUR favoured me with the &s;pecimen from
<PB N="98" REF="116">
which the annexed figure is copied; his Lord&s;hip told me he met with it in Wilt&s;hire la&s;t &s;ummer, with &s;everal other rare In&s;ects, which will appear &s;hortly in this work.</P>
