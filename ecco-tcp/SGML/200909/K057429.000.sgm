<P>GODSTOW is at pre&s;ent a Ruin on the Margin of the I&s;is, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from Oxford. It was formerly a Hou&s;e of Nuns, famous perhaps on no account &s;o much as for having been the Burial-place of Ro&s;amond, daughter of Lord Clifford, the beautiful Paramour of Henry the Second. This Monarch is &s;aid to have built a Labyrinth at Wood&s;tock to conceal her from his jealous Queen, who, during his Ab&s;ence, when he was called away by an unnatural Rebellion of his Sons, at the &s;uppo&s;ed In&s;tigation of their Mother, found means to get Acce&s;s to her, and compelled her to &s;wallow Poi&s;on. Frequent Walks in this delightful Rece&s;s, &s;acred to the Moments of Contempla|tion, &s;ugge&s;ted the following Thoughts, for the Publication of which, let the alarming Progre&s;s of Lewdne&s;s, and con&s;equently of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of Manners, which indeed threatens the Di&s;|&s;olution of our State, be accepted as an Apology.</P>

<L>Your eyes out&s;hine the &s;ilver orbs of night;</L>
<L>Serenely gay, and mild with &s;often'd light!</L>

<L>O may the Guardian of &s;o great a prize,</L>

<L>To ward off with'ring Care, the bane of Love!</L>

<L>For ah! in vain your beauties Heav'n be&s;tow'd,</L>
<L>If vicious Pa&s;&s;ion foul their fair abode!</L>
<L>Vice draws her deadlie&s;t bane from Beauty's pow'r,</L>
<L>The ranke&s;t poi&s;on from the riche&s;t Flow'r!</L>

<L>But prov'd too oft the bane of woman kind!</L>
<L>Who drink the poi&s;on of thy treach'rous eye,</L>
<L>With Circe &s;tabling in the &s;wini&s;h &s;ty!</L>
<L>More than deform their Maker's choice&s;t grace,</L>

<L>The Cherub Beauty chang'd, foregoes her light,</L>
<L>Like rebel Angels plung'd in rayle&s;s night:</L>
<L>From highe&s;t heights to lowe&s;t depths declin'd,</L>
<L>And fallen Woman's an infernal kind!</L>

<L>But chiefly Ye, o'er Honour's bounds that fly,</L>
<L>By Lu&s;t unloos'd from Hymen's holy tie!</L>
<L>Ye, join'd in hand, tho' ill your heart accords,</L>
<L>Who fail of fealty to your lawful Lords!</L>
