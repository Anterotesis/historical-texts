<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>"Paris,</HI> <DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 25, 1792. <HI>"Fir&s;t Year of the Republic.</HI></DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>"FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>I RECEIVE, with affectionate gratitude, the honour which the late National A&s;&s;em|bly has conferred upon me, by adopting me a Citizen of France; and the additional honour of being elected by my Fellow Citizens a Member of the National Con|vention. Happily impre&s;&s;ed as I am, by
<PB N="6" REF="4">tho&s;e te&s;timonies of re&s;pect &s;hewn towards me as an individual, I feel my felicity en|crea&s;ed by &s;eeing the barrier broke down that divided Patrioti&s;m by &s;pots of earth, and limited Citizen&s;hip to the &s;oil, like vegetation.</P>
<P>Had tho&s;e honours been conferred in an hour of national tranquillity, they would have afforded no other means of &s;hewing my affection, than to have accepted and enjoyed them; but they come accompanied with circum&s;tances that give me the honourable opportunity of commencing my Citizen|&s;hip in the &s;tormy hour of difficulties. I come not to enjoy repo&s;e. Convinced that the cau&s;e of France is the cau&s;e of all mankind, and that as Liberty cannot be purcha&s;ed by a wi&s;h, I gladly &s;hare with.
<PB N="7" REF="5">you the dangers and honours nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I am well aware, that the moment of any great change, &s;uch as that accompli&s;hed on the, 10th of Augu&s;t, is unavoidably the moment of terror and confu&s;ion. The mind, highly agitated by hope, &s;u&s;picion, and apprehen&s;ion, continues without re&s;t till the change be accompli&s;hed. But let us now look calmly and confidentially for|ward, and &s;ucce&s;s is certain. It is no longer the paltry cau&s;e of Kings, or of this, or of that individual, that calls France and her armies into action. It is the great cau&s;e of ALL. It is the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new aera, that &s;hall, blot De&s;poti&s;m from the earth, and fix, on the la&s;ting principles of Peace and Citizen&s;hip, the great Republic of Man.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6">It has been my fate to have borne a &s;hare in the commencement and complete e&s;tabli&s;hment of one Revolution (I mean the Revolution of America). The &s;ucce&s;s and events of that Revolution are encou|raging to us. The pro&s;perity and happi|ne&s;s that have &s;ince flowed to that country, have amply rewarded her for all the hard|&s;hips &s;he endured, and for all the dangers &s;he encountered.</P>
<P>The principles on which that Revolu|tion began, have extended them&s;elves to Europe; and an over-ruling Providence is regenerating the Old World by the princi|ples of the New. The di&s;tance of America from all the other parts of the globe, did not admit of her carrying tho&s;e principles beyond her own &s;ituation. It is to the pe|culiar honour of France, that &s;he now rai&s;es
<PB N="9" REF="7">the &s;tandard of Liberty for all nations; and in fighting her own battles contends for the rights of all mankind.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;pirit of fortitude that in|&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s to America, will in&s;ure it to France; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to conquer a nation determined to be free! the military circum&s;tances that now unite them&s;elves to France, are &s;uch as the de&s;pots of the earth know nothing of, and can form no calcula|tion upon. They know not what it is to fight again&s;t a nation. They have only been accu&s;tomed to make war upon each other; and they know from &s;y&s;tem and practice, how to calculate the probable &s;uc|ce&s;s of De&s;pot again&s;t De&s;pot; and here their knowledge and experience end.</P>
<P>But in a conte&s;t like the pre&s;ent, a new
<PB N="10" REF="8">and boundle&s;s variety of circum&s;tances ari&s;es, that deranges all &s;uch cu&s;tomary calculations. When a whole nation acts as an army, the De&s;pot knows not the extent of the power again&s;t which he contends. New armies ri&s;e again&s;t him with the nece&s;|&s;ity of the moment. It is then that the difficulties of an invading enemy multiply, as in the former ca&s;e they dimini&s;hed; and he finds them at their height when he ex|pected them to end.</P>
<P>The only war that has any, &s;imilarity of circum&s;tances with the pre&s;ent is the late Revolution-war in America. On her part, as it now is in France, it was a war of the whole nation. There it was, that the enemy, by beginning to conquer, put him&s;elf in a condition of being conquered. His fir&s;t victories prepared him for defeat. He ad|vanced
<PB N="11" REF="9">till he could not retreat, and found him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of a nation of armies.</P>
<P>Were it now to be propo&s;ed to the Au&s;trians and Pru&s;&s;ians, to e&s;cort them into the middle of France, and there leave them to make the mo&s;t of &s;uch a &s;ituation, they would &s;ee too much into the, dangers of it, to accept the offer; and the &s;ame dangers would attend them, could they arrive there by any other means. Where, then, is the military policy of their attempting to obtain by force, that which they would refu&s;e by choice? But to rea&s;on with De&s;pots is throwing rea&s;on away. The be&s;t of argu|ments is a vigorous preparation.</P>
<P>Man is ever a &s;tranger to the ways by which Providence regulates the order of things. The interference of foreign De&s;pots
<PB N="12" REF="10">may &s;erve to introduce into their own en|&s;laved countries the principles they come to oppo&s;e. Liberty and Equality are ble&s;|&s;ings too great to be the inheritance of France alone. It is honour to her to be the fir&s;t champion; and &s;he may now &s;ay to her enemies with a mighty voice, "O! ye Au&s;trians, ye Pru&s;&s;ians! ye who now turn your bayonets again&s;t us; it is for you; it is for all Europe; it is for all mankind, and not for France alone, that &s;he rai&s;es the &s;tandard of Liberty and Equality!"</P>
<P>The public cau&s;e has hitherto &s;uffered from the contradictions contained in the Con&s;titution of the former Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly. Tho&s;e contradictions have &s;erved to divide the opinions of individuals at home, and to ob&s;cure the great principles of the revolution in other countries. But
<PB N="13" REF="11">when tho&s;e contradictions &s;hall be removed, and the Con&s;titution be made conformable to the Declaration of Rights; when the bagatelles of monarchy, royalty, regency, and hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;hall be expo&s;ed with all their ab&s;urdities, a new ray of light will be thrown over the world, and the Re|volution will derive new &s;trength by being univer&s;ally under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The &s;cene that now opens it&s;elf to France extends far beyond the boundaries of her own dominions. Every nation is becoming her colleague, and every Court is become her enemy. It is now the cau&s;e of all Nations again&s;t the cau&s;e of all Courts. The terrors that De&s;poti&s;m felt, clande&s;|tinely begot a confederation of De&s;pots; and their attack upon France is produced by their fears at home.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="12">In entering on this great &s;cene, greater than any nation has yet been called to act in, let us &s;ay to the agitated mind&mdash;be calm. &mdash;Let us puni&s;h by in&s;tructing, rather than revenge. Let us begin the new aera by a greatne&s;s of friend&s;hip, and hail the ap|proach of union and &s;ucce&s;s.</P></Q>
