<HEAD>TO Mr. HENRY DUNDAS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><HI>London</HI> <DATE><HI>June</HI> 6, 1792.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS you opened the debate in the hou&s;e of Commons, May 25th, on the Pro|clamation for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing. Publications, which that Proclamation (without naming any) calls wicked and &s;editious, and as you applied tho&s;e approbrious epithets to the works entitled "RIGHTS OF MAN," I think it unne|ce&s;&s;ary to offer any other rea&s;on for addre&s;&s;ing this Letter to you.</P>
<P>I begin, then, at once, by declaring that I do not believe there are to be found in the writings of any author, ancient or modern, on the &s;ubject of Government, a &s;pirit of greater benignity, and a &s;tronger inculcation of moral
<PB N="4" REF="3">principles than in tho&s;e which I have publi&s;hed. They come, Sir, from a man, who, by having lived in different countries, and under different &s;y&s;tems of Government, and who, being in|timate in the con&s;truction of them, is a bet|ter judge of the &s;ubject than it is po&s;&s;ible that you, from the want of tho&s;e opportunities, can be:&mdash;And, be&s;ides this, they come from an heart that knows not how to beguile.</P>
<P>I will further &s;ay, that when that moment arrives in which the be&s;t con&s;olation that &s;hall be left will be that of looking back on &s;ome pa&s;t actions, more virtuous, more meritorious, than the re&s;t, I &s;hall then with happine&s;s re|member, among other things, I have written the RIGHTS OF MAN.&mdash;As to what Pro|clamations, or Pro&s;ecutions, or Place-men, or Place-expectants,&mdash;tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s, or tho&s;e who are gaping for office, may &s;ay of them, it will not alter their character, either with the world or with me.</P>
<P>Having, Sir, made this declaration, I &s;hall proceed to remark, not particularly upon your own Speech on that occa&s;ion, but on any other Speech to which your Motion on that day gave ri&s;e; and I &s;hall begin with that of Mr. ADAM.</P>
<P>This Gentleman accu&s;es me of <HI>not</HI> having done the very thing that <HI>I have done,</HI> and which he &s;ays, if I <HI>had</HI> done, he &s;hould not have ac|cu&s;ed me.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">Mr. ADAM, in his Speech, (&s;ee the Morn|ing Chronicle of May 26,) &s;ays, <Q>That he had well con&s;idered the &s;ubject of Con&s;titu|tional Publications, and was by no means ready to &s;ay (but the contrary) that books of &s;cience upon Government, though re|commending a doctrine or &s;y&s;tem different from the form of our Con&s;titution, (meaning that of England) were fit objects of pro&s;e|cution; that if he did, he mu&s;t condemn (which he meant not to do) HARRINGTON for his Oceana, SIR. THOMAS MORE for his Eutopia, and HUME for his Idea of a per|fect Common-wealth. But, (continued Mr. Adam,) the Publication of Mr. PAINE was very different; for it reviled what was <HI>mo&s;t &s;acred</HI> in the Con&s;titution, de&s;troyed every principle of &s;ubordination, and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed no|thing in their room.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I readily perceive that Mr. ADAM had not read the <HI>Second</HI> Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and I am put under the nece&s;&s;ity, either of &s;ubmitting to an erroneous charge, or of ju&s;|tifying my&s;elf again&s;t it; and I certainly &s;hall prefer the latter.&mdash;If, then, I &s;hall prove to Mr. ADAM, that, in my rea&s;oning upon Sy&s;|tems of Government in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> I have &s;hewn as clearly, I think, as words can convey ideas, a certain Sy&s;tem of Government, and that not exi&s;ting in theory only, but already in full and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed,
<PB N="6" REF="5">practice, and &s;y&s;tematically and practically free from all the vices and defects, of the Eng|li&s;h Government, and capable of producing more happine&s;s to the People, and that al&s;o with an eightieth part of the Taxes, which the pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem of Engli&s;h Government con&s;umes; I hope he will do me the ju&s;tice when he next goes to the Hou&s;e, to get up and confe&s;s he had been mi&s;taken in &s;aying, that I had <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed nothing, and that I had de&s;troyed every principle of &s;ubor|dination.</HI> Having thus opened the ca&s;e, I now come to the point.</P>
<P>In the Second Part of RIGHTS OF MAN, I have di&s;tingui&s;hed Government into two cla&s;&s;es or &s;y&s;tems; the one the hereditary &s;y&s;tem; the other the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In the Fir&s;t Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> I have en|deavoured to &s;hew, and I challenge any man to refute it, that there does not exi&s;t a right to e&s;ta|bli&s;h Hereditary Government; or, in other words Hereditary Governors; becau&s;e Hereditary Go|vernment always means a Government yet to come, and the ca&s;e always is, that the People who are to live afterwards, have always the &s;ame right to chu&s;e a Government for them&s;elves, as the people had who lived before them.</P>
<P>In the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> I have not repeated tho&s;e arguments, becau&s;e they are irrefutable; but have confined my&s;elf to &s;hew the defects of what is called Hereditary Government, or Hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion; that it mu&s;t, from the
<PB N="7" REF="6">nature of it, throw Government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it, from want of principle, or unfitted for it from want of capaci|ty.&mdash;James the IId. is recorded as an in&s;tance of the fir&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;es; and in&s;tances are to be found almo&s;t all over Europe to prove the truth of the latter.</P>
<P>To &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of the Hereditary Sy&s;|tem &s;till more &s;trongly, I will now put the fol|lowing ca&s;e&mdash;Take any fifty men promi&s;|cuou&s;ly, and it will be very extraordinary, if out of that number, one man &s;hould be found, who&s;e principles and talents taken together, (for &s;ome might have principles, and others have talents) would render him a per&s;on truly fitted to fill any very extraordinary office of Na|tional Tru&s;t. If, then, &s;uch a fitne&s;s of cha|racter could not be expected to be found in more than one per&s;on out of fifty, it would happen but one in a thou&s;and years to the elde&s;t &s;on of any one family, admitting each, on an average, to hold the office twenty years. Mr. Adam talks of &s;omething in the Con&s;titution which he calls <HI>mo&s;t &s;acred;</HI> but I hope he does not mean hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, a thing which appears to me a violation of every order of nature, and of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>When I look into Hi&s;tory, and &s;ee the mul|titudes of men, otherwi&s;e virtuous, who have died, and their families been ruined, in defence of knaves and fools, and which they would not
<PB N="8" REF="7">have done, had they rea&s;oned at all upon the &s;y&s;tem; I do not know a greater good that an individual can render to mankind, than to en|deavour to break the chains of political &s;uper|&s;tition. Tho&s;e chains are now di&s;&s;olving fa&s;t, and proclamations and pro&s;ecutions will &s;erve but to ha&s;ten that di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;poken of the Hereditary Sy&s;|tem as a bad &s;y&s;tem, and &s;ubject to every po&s;|&s;ible defect; I now come to the Repre&s;entative Sy&s;tem; and this Mr. ADAM will find &s;tated in the Second Part of the Rights of Man, not only as the be&s;t, but as the only <HI>Theory</HI> of Go|vernment under which the liberties of a people can be permanently &s;ecure.</P>
<P>But it is needle&s;s now to talk of mere Theo|ry, &s;ince there is already a Government in full practice, e&s;tabli&s;hed upon that Theory, or in other words, upon the Rights of Man, and has been &s;o for almo&s;t twenty years. Mr. Pitt, in a &s;peech of his &s;ome &s;hort time &s;ince, &s;aid, <Q>That there never did, and never could ex|i&s;t a Government e&s;tabli&s;hed upon tho&s;e Rights, and that if it began at noon, it would end at night.</Q> Mr. Pitt is not yet arrived at the degree of a &s;chool-boy in this &s;pecies of knowledge. His practice has been confined to the means of <HI>extorting revenue,</HI> and hi&s;t boa&s;t has been&mdash;<HI>how much ?</HI> Whereas the boa&s;t of the Sy&s;tem of Government that I am &s;peaking of, is not how much, but how little.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">The Sy&s;tem of Government purely repre|&s;entative, unmixed with any thing of here|ditary non&s;en&s;e, began in America. I will now compare the effects of that &s;y&s;tem of Go|vernment with the &s;y&s;tem of Government in England, both during, and &s;ince the clo&s;e of the war.</P>
<P>So powerful is the Repre&s;entative Sy&s;tem; fir&s;t, by combining and con&s;olidating all the parts of a country together, however great the extent; and &s;econdly, by admitting of none but men properly qualified into the Govern|ment, or di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them if they prove to be otherwi&s;e, that America was enabled thereby totally to defeat and overthrow all the &s;chemes and projects of the Hereditary Government of England again&s;t her. As the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Revolution and Independance of America is a proof of this fact, it is needle&s;s to enlarge upon it.</P>
<P>I now come to the comparative effect of the two Sy&s;tems <HI>&s;ince</HI> the clo&s;e of the war, and I re|que&s;t Mr. Adam to attend to it.</P>
<P>America had internally &s;u&s;tained the ravage of upwards of &s;even years of war, which En|gland had not. England &s;u&s;tained only the expence of the war; whereas America &s;u&s;tained, not only the expence, but the de&s;truction of property committed by <HI>both</HI> armies. Not a hou&s;e was built during that period, and many thou|&s;ands were de&s;troyed. The farms and planta|tions
<PB N="8" REF="9">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="9" REF="10">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="10" REF="11">along the coa&s;t of the country, for more than a thou&s;and miles, were laid wa&s;te. Her commerce was annihilated. Her &s;hips were ei|ther taken or had rotted within her own har|bour. The credit of her funds had fallen up|wards of ninety per cent that is, an original hundred pounds would not &s;ell for ten pounds. In fine, &s;he was apparently put back an hun|dred years when the war clo&s;ed; which was not the ca&s;e with England.</P>
<P>But &s;uch was the event, that the &s;ame Re|pre&s;entative Sy&s;tem of Government, though &s;ince better organized, which enabled her to conquer, enabled her al&s;o to recover; and &s;he now pre&s;ents a more flouri&s;hing condition, and a more happy and harmonized &s;ociety under that &s;y&s;tem of Government, than any country in the world can boa&s;t under any other. Her towns are rebuilt, much better than before; her farms and plantations are in higher im|provement than ever; her commerce is &s;pread over the world, and her funds have ri&s;en from le&s;s than ten pounds the hundred to upwards of one hundred and twenty. Mr. Pitt, and his colleagues, talk of the things that have hap|pened in his boyi&s;h Admini&s;tration, without knowing what greater things have happened el&s;ewhere, and under other &s;y&s;tems of Govern|ment.</P>
<P>I next come to &s;tate the expence of the two &s;y&s;tems, as they now &s;tand in each of the
<PB N="11" REF="12">countries; but it may fir&s;t be proper to ob|&s;erve, that Government in America is what it ought to be, a matter of honour and tru&s;t, and not made a trade of for the purpo&s;e of lucre.</P>
<P>The whole amount of the nett taxes in En|gland (exclu&s;ive of the expence of collection, of drawbacks, of &s;eizures and condemnations, of fines and penalties, of fees of office, of litiga|tions and informers, which are &s;ome of the ble&s;s|ed means of enforcing them) is, &s;eventeen mil|lions. Of this &s;um, about nine millions go for the payment of the intere&s;t of the National Debt, and the remainder, being about eight millions, is for the current annual expences. Thus much for one &s;ide of the ca&s;e. I now come to the other.</P>
<P>The expence of all the &s;everal departments of the general Repre&s;entative Government of the United States of America, extending over a &s;pace of country nearly ten times larger than England, is two hundred and ninety-four thou|&s;and, five hundred and fifty-eight dollars, which, at 4s. 6d. per dollar, is 66,275l. 11s. &s;terling, and is thus apportioned.</P>

<P>On account of the incur&s;ions of the Indians on the back &s;ettlements, Congre&s;s is, at this time, obliged to keep &s;ix thou&s;and militia in pay, in addition to a regiment of foot, and a battalion of artillery, which it always keeps; and this increa&s;es the expence of the War De|partment to 390,000 dollars, which is 87,795l. &s;terling, but when Peace &s;hall be concluded with the Indians, the greate&s;t part of this expence will cea&s;e, and the total amount of the expence of Government, including that of the army, will
<PB N="13" REF="14">not amount to one hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, which, as has been already &s;tated, is but an eighteenth part of the expences of the Engli&s;h Government.</P>
<P>I reque&s;t Mr. Adam and Mr. Dundas, and all tho&s;e who are talking of Con&s;titutions, and ble&s;&s;ings, and Kings, and Lords, and the Lord knows what, to look at this &s;tatement. Here is a form and &s;y&s;tem of Government, that is better organized and better admini&s;tered than any Government in the world, and that for le&s;s than one hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum, and yet every Member of Congre&s;s receives, as a compen&s;ation for his time and attendance on public bu&s;ine&s;s, one pound &s;even &s;hillings per day, which is at the rate of nearly five hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>This is a government that has nothing to fear. It needs no proclamations to deter peo|ple from writing and reading. It needs no po|litical &s;uper&s;tition to &s;upport it. It was by en|couraging di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and rendering the pre&s;s free upon all &s;ubjects of Government, that the principles of Government became under&s;tood in America, and the people are now enjoying the pre&s;ent ble&s;&s;ings under it. You hear of no riots, tumults, and di&s;orders in that country; becau&s;e their exi&s;ts no cau&s;e to produce them. Tho&s;e things are never the effect of Freedom, but of re&s;traint, oppre&s;&s;ion, and exce&s;&s;ive taxation.</P>
<P>In America there is not that cla&s;s of poor
<PB N="14" REF="15">and wretched people that are &s;o numerou&s;ly di&s;|per&s;ed all over England, and who are to be told by a Proclamation, that they are happy; and this is in a great mea&s;ure to be accounted for, not by the difference of Proclamations, but by the difference of Governments and the dif|ference of Taxes between that country and this. What the labouring people of that country earn they apply to their own u&s;e, and to the education of their children; and do not pay it away in taxes as fa&s;t as they earn it, to &s;upport Court extravagance, and a long enor|mous li&s;t of Place-men and pen&s;ioners; and be&s;ides this, they have learned the manly doctrine of reverencing them&s;elves, and con|&s;equently of re&s;pecting each other; and they laugh at tho&s;e imaginary beings called Kings and Lords, and all the fraudulent trumpery of Courts.</P>
<P>When Place-men and Pen&s;ioners, or tho&s;e who expect to be &s;uch, are lavi&s;h in prai&s;e of a Government, it is not a &s;ign of its being a good one. The pen&s;ion li&s;t alone, in England, (&s;ee Sir John Sinclair's Hi&s;tory of the Revenue, page 6, of the Appendix,) is One Hundred and &s;even thou&s;and Four Hundred and Four Pounds, <HI>which is more than the expences of the whole Government of America amount to.</HI> And I am now more convinced than before, that the offer that was made to me of a Thou&s;and Pounds, for the copy-right of the Second Part of the
<PB N="15" REF="16"><HI>Rights of Man,</HI> together with the remaining copy-right of the Fir&s;t Part, was to have ef|fected, by a quick &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, what is now at|tempted to be done by a Pro&s;ecution. The connection which the per&s;on who made that offer has with the King's Printing Office, may furni&s;h part of the means of enquiring into this affair, when the Mini&s;try &s;hall plea&s;e to bring their Pro&s;ecution to i&s;&s;ue. But to return to my &s;ubject.&mdash;</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> and I repeat it here, that the &s;ervice of any man, whether called King, Pre&s;ident, Se|nator, Legi&s;lator, or any thing el&s;e, cannot be worth more to any country, in the regular rou|tine of office, than Ten Thou&s;and Pounds per annum. We have a better man in America, and more of a Gentleman than any King I ever knew of, who does not occa&s;ion even half that expence; for, though the &s;alary is fixed at Five Thou&s;and Two Hundred and Sixty-Five Pounds, he does not accept it, and it is only the incidental expences that are paid out of it. The name by which a man is called is, of it&s;elf, but an empty thing. It is worth and character alone which can render him valuable, for without the&s;e, Kings, and Lords, and Pre&s;idents are but jingling names.</P>
<P>But without troubling my&s;elf about Con&s;ti|tutions of Government, I have &s;hewn, in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> that an alliance
<PB N="16" REF="17">may be formed between England, France, and America, and that the expences of Government in England may be put back to one million and an half, viz.</P>

And even this &s;um is fifteen times greater than the expences of Government are in America; and it is al&s;o greater than the whole peace e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of England amounted to about an hundred years ago. So much has the weight and oppre&s;&s;ion of Taxes encrea&s;ed &s;ince the Re|volution, and e&s;pecially &s;ince the year, 1714.</P>
<P>To &s;hew that the &s;um of 500,000l. is &s;uf|ficient to defray all the civil expences of Go|vernment, I have, in that work, annexed the following e&s;timate for any country of the &s;ame extent as England:</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, three hundred Repre&s;enta|tives, fairly elected, are &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es to which Legi&s;lation can apply, and preferable to a larger number.</P>
<P>If then an allowance, at the rate of five hundred pounds per ann. be made to every Re|pre&s;entative, deducting for non-attendance, the expence, if the whole number attended &s;ix months each year, would be &pound; 75,000</P>

<P>If a Nation cho&s;e, it might deduct four per cent. from all the offices, and make one of twenty thou&s;and pounds per annum; and &s;tyle the per&s;on who &s;hould fill it, King, or Maje&s;|ty, or Madje&s;ty, or give him any other title.</P>
<P>Taking, however, this &s;um of one million and an half as an abundant &s;upply for all the expences of Government under any form what|ever, there will remain a &s;urplus of nearly &s;ix millions and an half out of the pre&s;ent Taxes, after paying the intere&s;t of the National Debt; and I have &s;hewn, in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> what appears to me the be&s;t mode of applying the &s;urplus money; for I am now &s;peaking of expences and &s;avings, and not of &s;y&s;tems of Government.</P>
<P>I have in the fir&s;t place, e&s;timated the poor-rates at two millions annually, and &s;hewn that the fir&s;t effectual &s;tep would be to aboli&s;h the poor-rates entirely, (which would be a &s;aving
<PB N="18" REF="19">of two millions to the hou&s;e-keepers,) and to remit four millions out of the &s;urplus taxes to the poor to be paid to them in money in pro|portion to the number of children in each fa|mily, and the number of aged per&s;ons.</P>
<P>I have e&s;timated the number of per&s;ons of both &s;exes in England, of fifty years of age and upwards, at 420,000, and have taken one-third of this number, viz. 140,000, to be poor people.</P>
<P>To &s;ave long calculations, I have taken 70,000 of them to be upwards of fifty years of age and under &s;ixty, and the other to be &s;ixty years and upwards; and to allow &s;ix pounds per ann. to the former cla&s;s, and ten pounds per ann. to the latter. The expence of which will be,

</ROW>
</TABLE>
There will then remain of the four millions 2,880,000l. I have &s;tated two different methods of appropriating this money. The one is to pay it in proportion to the number of children in each family, at the rate of three or four pounds per ann. for each child; the other is, to apportion it according to the expence of living in different countries; but in either of the&s;e ca&s;es it would, together with the allowance to be made to the aged, completely take off taxes from one-third of all the families in England, be&s;ides
<PB N="19" REF="20">relieving all the other families from the burthen of poor-rates.</P>
<P>The whole number of families in England, lotting five &s;ouls to each family, is one million four hundred thou&s;and, of which I take one third, viz. 466,666 to be poor families, who now pay four millions of taxes, and that the poore&s;t pays at lea&s;t four guineas a year; and that the other thirteen millions are paid by the other two-thirds. The plan, therefore, as &s;tated in the work is, fir&s;t, to remit or repay, as is al|ready &s;tated, this &s;um of four millions to the poor, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate them from the others in the pre&s;ent mode of collect|ing taxes on articles of con&s;umption; and, &s;e|condly, to aboli&s;h the poor-rates, the hou&s;e and window-light tax, and to change the Com|mutation Tax into a progre&s;&s;ive Tax on large e&s;tates, the particulars of all which are &s;et forth in the work, and to which I de&s;ire Mr. ADAM to refer for particulars. I &s;hall here content my|&s;elf with &s;aying, that to a town of the population of Manche&s;ter, it will make a difference in its favour, compared with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, of upwards of fifty thou&s;and pounds annually, and &s;o in proportion to all other places through|out the nation. This certainly is of more con|&s;equence, than that the &s;ame &s;ums &s;hould be collected to be afterwards &s;pent by riotous and profligate courtiers, and in nightly revels at the Star and Garter Tavern, Pall-Mall.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">I will conclude this part of my letter with an extract from the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> which Mr. Dundas (a man rolling in luxury at the expence of the nation) has brand|ed with the epithet of "wicked."</P>
<P><Q>By the operation of this plan, the poor laws, tho&s;e ins;truments of civil torture, will be &s;uper&s;eded, and the wa&s;teful expence of litigation prevented. The hearts of the hu|mane will not be &s;hocked by ragged and hun|gry children, and pers;ons of &s;eventy and eighty years of age begging for bread. The dying poor will not be dragged from place to place, to breathe their la&s;t, as a repri&s;al of pa|ri&s;h upon pari&s;h. Widows will have a main|tenance for their children, and not be carted away, on the death of their hu&s;bands, like culprits and criminals, and children will no longer be con&s;idered as increa&s;ing the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their parents. The haunts of the wretched will be known, becau&s;e it will be to their advantage, and the number of petty crimes, the offspring of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, will be le&s;&s;ened. The poor, as well as the rich, will then be intere&s;ted in the &s;upport of Govern|ment and the cau&s;e and apprehen&s;ion of riots and tumults will cea&s;e. Ye who &s;it in ea&s;e, and &s;olace your&s;elves in plenty, and &s;uch there are in Turkey and Ru&s;&s;ia as well as in Eng|land, and who &s;ay to your&s;elves, <HI>are we not well off?</HI> have ye thought of the&s;e things?
<PB N="21" REF="22">When ye do, ye will cea&s;e to &s;peak and feel for yours;elves alone.</Q>&mdash;Rights of Man, Part II. p. 136.</P>
<P>After this remis;s;ion of four millions be made, and the poor Rates and Hous;e and Window|light Tax be aboli&s;hed, and the Commutation Tax changed, there will &s;till remain nearly one million and an half of &s;urplus Taxes; and as by an alliance between England, France, and America, armies and navies will, in a great mea&s;ure be rendered unnece&s;&s;ary; and as men who have either been brought up in, or long ha|bited to, tho&s;e lines of life, are &s;till citizens of a nation in common with the re&s;t, and have a right to participate in all plans of National benefit, it is &s;tated in that work (Rights of Man, Part II.) to apply annually 507,000l. out of the &s;urplus taxes to this purpo&s;e in the following manner:

<P>The limits to which it was proper to confine this letter, will not admit of my entering into
<PB N="22" REF="23">further particulars. I addre&s;s it to Mr. Dundas becau&s;e he took the lead in the debate, and he wi&s;hes, I &s;uppo&s;e, to appear con&s;picuous; but the purport of it is to ju&s;tify my&s;elf from the charge which Mr. Adam has made.</P>
<P>This Gentleman, as has been ob&s;erved in the beginning of this Letter, con&s;iders the writings of Harrington, Moore, and Hume, as ju&s;tifia|ble and legal Publications, becau&s;e they rea&s;on|ed by compari&s;on, though, in &s;o doing, they &s;hewed plans and &s;y&s;tems of Government, not only different from, but preferable to, that of England; and he accu&s;es me of endeavouring to confu&s;e, in&s;tead of producing a &s;y&s;tem in the room of that which which I had rea&s;oned again&s;t; whereas the fact is, that I have not only rea&s;on|ed by compari&s;on of the Repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem again&s;t the Hereditary &s;y&s;tem, but I have gone further; for I have produced an in&s;tance of a Government e&s;tabli&s;hed entirely on the Repre|&s;entative &s;y&s;tem, under which much greater hap|pine&s;s is enjoyed, much fewer Taxes required, and much higher credit is e&s;tablis;hed, than under the &s;y&s;tem of Government in England. The Funds in England have ri&s;en &s;ince the war only from 54l. to 97l. and they have been down, &s;ince the Proclamations, to 87l. whereas the Funds in America ro&s;e in the mean time from 10l. to 120l. His charge again&s;t me "of de&s;troying every principle of &s;ubordination," is equally as groundle&s;s, which even a &s;ingle paragraph from
<PB N="23" REF="24">the work will prove, and which I &s;hall here quote:</P>
<P><Q>Formerly, when divi&s;ions aro&s;e re&s;pecting Go|vernments, recour&s;e was had to the &s;word, and a civil war en&s;ued. That &s;avage cu&s;tom is ex|ploded by the new &s;y&s;tem, and <HI>recour&s;e is had to a National Convention.</HI> Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and the generol will, arbitrates the que&s;tion, and to this private opinion yields with a good grace, and <HI>order is pre&s;erved uninterrupted.</HI></Q>&mdash;Rights of Man, Part II. p. 173.</P>
<P>That two different charges &s;hould be brought at the &s;ame time, the one by a Member of the Le|gi&s;lative for <HI>not</HI> doing a certain thing, and the other by the Attorney General for <HI>doing,</HI> it, is a &s;trange jumble of contradictions. I have now ju&s;|tified my&s;elf, or the work rather, again&s;t the fir&s;t, by &s;tating the ca&s;e in this letter, and the ju&s;tifica|tion of the other will be undertaken in its proper place. But in any ca&s;e the work will go on.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude this Letter with &s;aying, that the only objection I found again&s;t the plan, and principles contained in the Second Part of <HI>Rights of Man</HI> when I had written the book, was, that they would beneficially intere&s;t at lea&s;t nine|ty-nine per&s;ons out of every hundred throughout the nation, and therefore would not leave &s;ufficient room for men to act from the direct and di&s;inter|e&s;ted principle of honour; but the pro&s;ecution now commenced has fortunately removed that objec|tion, and the approvers and protectors of that
<PB N="24" REF="25">work now feel the immediate impul&s;e of honour, added to that National Intere&s;t.</P>

<P>Taking it for granted, that the afore&s;aid Ad|verti&s;ement, equally as ob&s;cure as the Proclama|tion to which it refers, has neverthele&s;s &s;ome meaning, and is intended to effect &s;ome purpo&s;e; and as pro&s;ecution (whether wi&s;ely or unwi&s;ely, ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly) is already commenced again&s;t a work intitled RIGHTS OF MAN, of which I have the honour and happine&s;s to be the author; I feel it nece&s;&s;ary to addre&s;s this Letter to you, and to reque&s;t that it may be read publicly to the Gentlemen who &s;hall meet at Ep&s;om in con&s;e|quence of the Adverti&s;ement.</P>
<P>The work now under pro&s;ecution is, I conceive, the &s;ame work which is intended to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the afore&s;aid Proclamation.&mdash;Admitting this to be the ca&s;e, the Gentlemen of the county of Surrey are called upon by &s;omebody to condemn a work, and they are at the &s;ame time forbidden by the Proclamation to know what that work is; and they are further called upon to give their aid
<PB N="26" REF="27">and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to prevent other people from know|ing it al&s;o.&mdash;It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary that the Au|thor, for his own ju&s;tification, as well as to pre|vent the Gentlemen who &s;hall meet from being impo&s;ed upon by mi&s;repre&s;entation, &s;hould give &s;ome outlines of the principles and plans which that work contains.</P>
<P>The work, Sir, in que&s;tion contains, fir&s;t, an inve&s;tigation of general principles of Govern|ment.</P>
<P>It al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hes Government into two cla&s;|&s;es or &s;y&s;tems, the one the hereditary &s;y&s;tem&mdash; the other the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem; and it com|pares the&s;e two &s;y&s;tems with each other.</P>
<P>It &s;hews, that what is called Hereditary Go|vernment cannot exi&s;t as a matter of right; be|cau&s;e Hereditary Government always means a Government yet to come; and the ca&s;e always is, that tho&s;e who are to live afterwards have al|ways the &s;ame right to e&s;tabli&s;h a Government for them&s;elves as the people who had lived be|fore them.</P>
<P>It al&s;o &s;hews the defect to which Hereditary Government is unavoidably &s;ubject: that it mu&s;t, from the nature of it, throw Government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it from the want of principle, or unfitted for it from want of capacity. JAMES the IId. and many others are recorded in the Engli&s;t Hi&s;tory, as proofs of the former of tho&s;e ca&s;es, and in&s;tances are to be found almo&s;t over Europe, to prove the truth of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28">It then &s;hews that the repre&s;entative &s;y&s;tem is the only true &s;y&s;tem of Government; that it is al&s;o the only &s;y&s;tem under which the liberties of any people can be permanently &s;ecure; and fur|ther, that it is the only one that can continue the &s;ame equal probability at all times of admitting of none but men properly qualified, both by princi|ples and abilities, into Government, and of exclud|ing &s;uch as are otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The work &s;hews al&s;o, by plans and calcula|tion not hitherto denied nor controverted, not even by the pro&s;ecution that is commenced, that the taxes now exi&s;ting may be reduced at lea&s;t &s;ix millions, that taxes may be entirely taken off from the Poor, who are computed at one third of the nation; and that taxes on the other two thirds may be con&s;iderably reduced&mdash; that the aged Poor may be comfortably provided for, and the children of poor families properly educated&mdash;that fifteen thou&s;and &s;oldiers, and the &s;ame number of &s;ailors; may be di&s;banded and allowed three &s;hillings per week during life out of the &s;urplus taxes; and al&s;o that a proportion-allowance may be made to the officers, and the pay of the remaining &s;oldiers and &s;ailors be en|crea&s;ed; and that it is better to apply the &s;ur|plus taxes to tho&s;e purpo&s;es than to con&s;ume them upon lazy and profligate placemen and pen&s;ioners; and that the revenue, &s;aid to be twenty thou&s;and pounds per annum, rai&s;ed by a tax upon coals, and given to the Duke of RICHMOND, is a gro&s;s impo&s;ition upon all the
<PB N="28" REF="29">people of London, ought to be in&s;tantly abo|li&s;hed.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is a conci&s;e ab&s;tract of the prin|ciples and plans contained in the work that is now pro&s;ecuted, and for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of which the Proclamation appears to be intended: but as it is impo&s;&s;ible that I can in the compa&s;s of a letter, bring into view all the matters contained in the work, and as it is proper that the Gen|tlemen who may compo&s;e that Meeting &s;hould know what the merits or demerits of it are, be|fore they come to any re&s;olutions, either direct|ly or indirectly relating thereto, I reque&s;t the honour of pre&s;enting them with one hundred copies of the Second Part of the RIGHTS OF MAN, and al&s;o one thou&s;and copies of my letter to Mr. DUNDAS, which I have directed to be &s;ent to Ep&s;om for that purpo&s;e; and I beg the favour of the Chairman to take the trouble of pre&s;enting them to the Gentlemen who &s;hall meet on that occa&s;ion, with my &s;incere wi&s;hes for their happine&s;s, and for that of the Nation in general.</P>
<P>Having now clo&s;ed thus much of the &s;ubject of my letter, I next come to &s;peak of what has relation to me per&s;onally. I am well aware of the delicacy that attends it, but the purpo&s;e of calling the Meeting appears to me &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with that ju&s;tice that is always due between man and man, that it is proper I &s;hould (as well on account of the Gentlemen who may meet, as
<PB N="29" REF="30">on my own account) explain my&s;elf fully and candidly thereon.</P>
<P>I have already informed the Gentlemen, that a pro&s;ecution is commenced again&s;t a work of which I have the honour and happine&s;s to be the Author; and I have good rea&s;ons for believ|ing that the Proclamation which the Gentlemen are called to con&s;ider, and to pre&s;ent an Addre&s;s upon, is purpo&s;ely calculated to give an impre&s;|&s;ion to the Jury before whom that matter is to come. In &s;hort, that it is dictating a verdict by Proclamation; and I con&s;ider the in&s;tigators of the Meeting to be held at Ep&s;om, as aiding and abetting the &s;ame improper, and in my opi|nion illegal purpo&s;e, and that in a manner very artfully contrived, as I &s;hall now &s;hew.</P>
<P>Had a Meeting been called of the Freeholders of the County of Middle&s;ex, the Gentlemen who had compo&s;ed that Meeting would have rendered them&s;elves objectionable as per&s;ons to &s;erve on a Jury before whom the judicial ca&s;e was afterwards to come. But by calling a meet|ing out of the County of Middle&s;ex, that mat|ter is artfully avoided, and the Gentlemen of Surrey are &s;ummoned, as if it were intended thereby to give a tone to the &s;ort of verdict which the in&s;tigators of the Meeting no doubt wi&s;h &s;hould be brought in, and to give counte|nance to the Jury in &s;o doing.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>June,</HI> 21, 1792.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I wrote you the Letter which Mr. HORNE TOOKE did me the favour to pre|&s;ent to you, as Chairman of the Meeting held at Ep&s;om, Monday, June 18th it was not with much expectation that you would, do me the ju&s;|tice of permitting, or recommending it to be pub|lickly read. I am well aware that the &s;ignature of THOMAS PAINE has &s;omething in it dreadful to &s;inecure Placemen and Pen&s;ioners; and when you, on &s;eeing the Letter opened, informed the Meeting that it was &s;igned THOMAS PAINE, and added, in a note of exclamation, "the common enemy of us all," you &s;poke one of the greate&s;t truths you ever uttered, if you confine the ex|pre&s;&s;ion to men of the &s;ame de&s;cription with your|&s;elf; men living in indolence and luxury, on the &s;poil and labours of the public.</P>
<P>The letter has &s;ince appeared in the ARGUS, and probably in other papers. It will ju&s;tify it|&s;elf; but if any thing on that account hath been wanting, your own conduct at the Meeting
<PB N="31" REF="32">would have &s;upplied the omi&s;&s;ion. You there &s;ufficiently proved that I was not mi&s;taken in &s;up|po&s;ing that the Meeting was called to give an in|direct aid to the pro&s;ecution commenced again&s;t a work, the reputation of which will long out-live the memory of the Pen&s;ioner I am writing to.</P>
<P>When Meetings, Sir, are called by the parti|zans of the Court, to preclude the Nation the right of inve&s;tigating Sy&s;tems and Principles of Government, and of expo&s;ing errors and defects, under the pretence of pro&s;ecuting any individual &mdash;it furni&s;hes an additional motive for maintain|ing facred that violated right.</P>
<P>The principles and arguments contained, in the work in que&s;tion, RIGHTS OF MAN, have &s;tood, and they now &s;tand, and I believe ever will &s;tand, unrefuted. They are &s;tated in a fair and open manner to the world, and they have al|ready received the public approbation of a greater number of men, of the be&s;t of characters, of every denomination of religion, and of every rank in life, (Placemen and Pen&s;ioners excepted) than all the Juries that &s;hall meet in England, for ten years to come, will amount to, and I have more-good rea&s;ons for believing that the approvers of that work, as well private as public, are already more numerous than all the pre&s;ent Electors throughout the Nation.</P>
<P>Not le&s;s than forty pamphlets, intended as an|&s;wers thereto, have appeared, and as &s;uddenly di&s;|appeared: Scarcely are the titles of any of them remembered, notwith&s;tanding their endeavours
<PB N="32" REF="33">have been aided by all the daily abu&s;e which the Court and Mini&s;tterial New&s;papers, for almo&s;t a year and a half, could be&s;tow, both upon the work and the author; and now that every at|tempt to refute, and every abu&s;e has failed, the invention of calling the work a Libel has been hit upon, and the di&s;comfited party has pu&s;illa|nimou&s;ly retreated to pro&s;ecution and a Jury, and ob&s;cure Addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As I well knew that a long Letter from me will not be agreeable to you, I will relieve your un|ea&s;ine&s;s by making it as &s;hort as I conveniently can; and will conclude it with taking up the &s;ub|ject at that part where Mr. HORNE TOOKE was interrupted from going on when at the Meeting.</P>
<P>That Gentleman was &s;taring, that the &s;itu|ation you &s;tood in render it improper for you to appear <HI>actively</HI> in a &s;cene in which your private intere&s;t was too vi&s;ible; that you were a Bed|chamber Lord at a thou&s;and a year, and a Pen|&s;ioner at three thou&s;and pounds a year more&mdash; and here he was &s;topped by the little, but noi&s;y circle you had collected round. Permit me then, Sir, to add an explanation to his words, for the benefit of your neighbours, and with which, and a few ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall clo&s;e my letter.</P>
<P>When it was reported in the Engli&s;h New&s;|papers, &s;ome &s;hort time &s;ince, that the Empre&s;s of RUSSIA had given to one of her minions a large tract of country, and &s;everal thou&s;ands of
<PB N="33" REF="34">pea&s;ants as property, it very ju&s;tly provoked in|dignation and abhorrence in tho&s;e who heard it. But if we compare the mode practiced in Eng|land, with that which appears to us &s;o abhorrent in Ru&s;&s;ia, it will be found to amount to very near the &s;ame thing;&mdash;for example&mdash;</P>
<P>As the whole of the revenue in England is drawn by taxes from the pockets of the people, tho&s;e things called gifts and grants, (of which kind are all pen&s;ions and &s;inecure places) are paid out of that &s;tock. The difference, there|fore, between the two modes is, that in England the money is collected by the Government, and then given to the Pen&s;ioner, and in Ru&s;&s;ia he is left to collect it for him&s;elf. The &s;malle&s;t &s;um which the poore&s;t family in a county &s;o near London as Surrey, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to pay annu|ally of taxes, is not le&s;s than five pounds; and as your &s;inecure of one thou&s;and, and pen&s;ion of three thou&s;and per annum, are made up of taxes paid by eight hundred &s;uch poor families, it comes to the &s;ame thing as if the eight hundered families had been given to you, as in Ru&s;&s;ia, and you had collected the money on your ac|count. Were you to &s;ay that you are not quar|tered particularly on the people of Surrey, but on the nation at large, the objection would a|mount to nothing; for as there are more Pen&s;i|oners than counties, every one may be con&s;ider|ed as quartered on that in which he lives</P>
<P>What honour or happine&s;s you can derive
<PB N="34" REF="35">from being the PRINCIPAL PAUPER of the neighbourhood, and occa&s;ioning a greater ex|pence than the poor, the aged, and the infirm, for ten miles round you, I leave you to enjoy. At the &s;ame time I can &s;ee that it is no wonder you &s;hould be &s;trenuous in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a book which &s;trikes at the root of tho&s;e abu&s;es. No wonder that you &s;hould be again&s;t Reforms, a|gain&s;t the Freedom of the Pre&s;s, and the Right of Inve&s;tigation. To you, and to others of your de&s;cription, the&s;e are dreadful things; but you &s;hould al&s;o con&s;ider, that the motives which prompt you to <HI>act,</HI> ought, by reflection, to com|pel you to be <HI>&s;ilent.</HI></P>
<P>Having now returned your compliment, and &s;ufficiently tired your patience, I take my leave of you, with mentioning, that if you had not prevented my former Letter from being read at the Meeting, you would not have had the trou|ble of reading this; and al&s;o with reque&s;ting, that the next time you call me <Q><HI>a common ene|my,</HI></Q> you would add, "<HI>of us &s;inecure Placemen and Pen&s;ioners.</HI></P>
