<P>As I have attempted to write a Comedy at the flattering in&s;tigation of your Lord&s;hip, the following &s;cenes have a natural claim to your protection. If, when you prompted and encouraged me to court the Comic Mu&s;e, you had imparted to me at the &s;ame time &s;ome &s;hare of your in&s;tinctive penetration into character&mdash; of your elegant, but impre&s;|&s;ive ridicule of fa&s;hionable levities&mdash;had you con&s;igned to my hand the clue that guides you in the chace and detection of folly through the intricate windings of her labyrinth, I &s;hould have pre&s;ented to you a Comedy more worthy of your attention. Such as it is, it offers me an opportunity of publickly ac|knowledging the high value I &s;et upon a friend&s;hip, which I have had the happine&s;s of enjoying &s;o many years.</P>

<L>"SHOOT Folly as it flies." Such is the game,</L>
<L>At which, 'tis &s;aid, the Comic Mu&s;e &s;hould aim;</L>
<L>The darker pa&s;&s;ions that the heart deform,</L>

<L>Yet when &s;he fain would &s;trike &s;uch tow'ring prey,</L>
<L>The &s;erious Dam&s;el takes the &s;afe&s;t way;</L>
<L>Tho' proud yet prudent&mdash;wounding guilt too high,</L>

<L>In &s;luggi&s;h apathy you carele&s;s &s;it,</L>
<L>Nor &s;mart for crimes that you could ne'er commit:</L>
<L>But, in the comic province, who &s;hall dare</L>
<L>To touch the faults that you may haply &s;hare?</L>
<L>For con&s;cience then may &s;trengthen the appeal,</L>
<L>And bid you cru&s;h what forces her to feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For Virtue, zealous and di&s;daining awe,</L>
<L>E'en fear'd by tho&s;e too mighty for the law,</L>
<L>The Stage, through ev'ry &s;tation, Vice has try'd,</L>

<L>More dreading cen&s;ure than pre&s;uming prai&s;e.</L>
<L>One point we fairly in his cau&s;e may plead&mdash;</L>

<L>Dares &s;trip from dull conceit its bold pretence,</L>
<L>And prove an Author may be void of &s;en&s;e.</L>
<L>Then let your candour countenance the grace</L>
<L>That freely owns the follies of his race;</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> FASHION.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM happy at your Lady&s;hip's arrival. We ex|pected you la&s;t night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bellair.</SPEAKER>
<P>I purpo&s;ely avoided coming la&s;t night, that I might not be complicated in the em|barra&s;&s;ment of the Welch family's arrival, whom I under&s;tand came ye&s;terday. What &s;ort of crea|tures are they? How many did the caravan con&s;i&s;t of? I expect to &s;ee the whole race of Shenkin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not be alarmed as to their num|ber; I will give your Lady&s;hip a li&s;t of the <HI>dra|matis per&s;onae,</HI> and a faint &s;ketch of their characters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do! for I have &s;een nobody, not even my brother, the <HI>padrone della ca&s;a.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Melcourt, I know, is walked out; I was ju&s;t enquiring after him. But to return to the &s;ubject;&mdash;Ye&s;terday evening, the family coach, covered with du&s;t, and much damaged by the toil and length of the journey, waddled up to
<PB N="6" REF="10">the hall-door in great labour, and was happily de|livered of Sir Pepper Plinlimmon, Lady Plinlim|mon, Mi&s;s Plinlimmon, and a <HI>femme de chambre;</HI> two &s;ervants attended on Welch ponies. The coach, I mu&s;t inform you, contained originally five per&s;ons, but it mi&s;carried on the road of Mr. Taffey, their chaplain, who could not bear the in|&s;ide of a carriage. He is, however, expected to|morrow, in the ba&s;ket of &s;ome &s;tage-coach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy we &s;hall be able to do without Mr. Taffey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you are mi&s;taken. He is one of the e&s;&s;ential per&s;onages in our drama, for he is to join the hands of Lord Melcourt and Mi&s;s Plinlimmon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;ort of a thing is the girl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is very well as to beauty; her &s;hape elegantly and harmoniou&s;ly formed, but when in motion, ungraceful. Her mind is a com|pound of ignorance and information, like the waving branches that give a checquered kind of light. She made us laugh la&s;t night at &s;upper with the childi&s;h &s;implicity of her que&s;tions, and &s;ometimes &s;he excited our admiration at the quickne&s;s of her repartee, and the &s;olidity of her judgment; in a word, &s;he appears to be an in&s;pired ideot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now let me have the portrait of Sir Pepper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Pepper is a plain, una&s;&s;uming man, &s;ubject at times to a warmth of temper, and who&s;e local train of impoveri&s;hed ideas are quite un&s;uitable to the &s;cene he is now entering upon, and to the company with which he is now to a&s;&s;o|&s;ociate. His mind has received a peculiar bia&s;s re&s;pecting the prophecies that have been floating of late, and he is almo&s;t convinced the world will be at an end before his daughter has brought Lord Melcourt a &s;on and heir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s, I like the whim&s;icallity of that notion; it will &s;erve to amu&s;e us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for Lady Plinlimmon, &s;he has a con&s;iderable &s;hare of vanity; half of which &s;he &s;pends in admiration of her daughter-in-law, the other &s;he con&s;umes upon her&s;elf. She imagines &s;he has a refined ta&s;te for literature, that &s;he is a &s;upreme judge of painting, and&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! then &s;he is intolerable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means. There is a broad good-humour about her which makes her inoffen&s;ive. She looks with impatience for the honour of ce|menting an acquaintance with your Lady&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, from your de&s;cription, it will not be unentertaining to pa&s;s a day or two with the&s;e Welch Emigrants. But does my brother &s;eem happy at his approaching nuptials?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ye&s;terday he &s;eemed at fir&s;t over|come by the inva&s;ion of the&s;e Vandals; but his native mirth rallied, and at the clo&s;e of the evening he was him&s;elf again. But here he comes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Lord</HI> MELCOURT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Si&s;ter, you are welcome! You look in high beauty. The elegant circles in town will be eclip&s;ed without you. Have you &s;een our new kindred?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not yet. Mr. Fa&s;hion has been giv|ing me a &s;light &s;ketch of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am ready to con&s;ign Sir Pepper, and Lady Plinlimmon to the full di&s;|charge of your raillery; but &s;pare, I intreat you, my &s;hepherde&s;s of the Alps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear; never fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Plinlimmon looks for your arrival with all the flutter of anxious expectation. Your fame, like an artful prologue, has &s;moothed
<PB N="8" REF="12">the way to a kind reception: &s;he talks of you as the paragon of excellence; &s;he will &s;tudy your whole per&s;on; ob&s;erve every motion, attitude, and every article of your dre&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Bellair may be &s;aid to be a capital picture from the gallery of fa&s;hion, for Lady Plinlimmon to copy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will venture to &s;ay, without the im|peachment of vanity, that the copy will not come up to the merit of the original.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip is perfectly right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But tell me, brother, don't you feel, independent of the charms of your young bride, an uncommon ela&s;ticity of mind in the removal of the incumbrances which this marriage will effect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Upon that ground I plant the &s;tandard of my gaudie&s;t &s;treamer. I have had a private conference with Sir Pepper, and his im|mediate relinqui&s;hing of his Brecknock&s;hire e&s;tate will enable me to part with my Iri&s;h acres, and &s;atisfy all my noi&s;y claimants; who, like a vora|cious pack of hounds, have chaced me from hill to dale, and notwith&s;tanding the windings of excu&s;es, and the intricate mazes of delay, would have &s;oon overtaken me, had not this golden &s;hower from the Welch mountains put an end to the chace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo! Are we to expect any more company?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have invited my friend Fancy, the miniature-painter. I expect al&s;o Phren&s;y, the poet, whom you have often heard me talk of; he will &s;uit Lady Plinlimmon, and their mutual ec|centricities will divert us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad that oddity will be added to the group; you have frequently amu&s;ed me with anecdotes concerning him. When will he be here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I expect him every minute. He writes word he will be here to-day, but begs his
<PB N="9" REF="13">coming may be a &s;ecret; and, as he is not per&s;on|nally known to any body but my&s;elf, he de&s;ires to a&s;&s;ume the name of Tomb&s;tone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a whim! What can he mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mo&s;t likely he is afraid of his cre|ditors&mdash;however, do not betray him to the re&s;t of our &s;ociety. But here come our Welch relatives, <STAGE>(<HI>Enter Sir</HI> PEPPER PLINLIMMON, <HI>Lady</HI> PLIN|LIMMON, <HI>and Mi&s;s</HI> PLINLIMMON.)</STAGE> Give me leave to pre&s;ent Lady Bellair, to your Lady&s;hip.</P>

<P>I beg your Lady&s;hip will let Sir Pepper &s;ay what he choo&s;es, I am not ea&s;ily alarm|ed: credulity is not my foible. But this is a con|ver&s;ation of too &s;evere a ca&s;t for our young bride: you, my dear, may &s;end your expecting eye through a long and gay per&s;pective.</P>

<P>Oh yes! he frequently wrote to me, and he u&s;ed to &s;ay in his letters, that when I &s;hould come to Melcourt Hall, we &s;hould wander through the groves together, and he would &s;ay &s;uch tender things to me by the river-&s;ide. Now we were by the river-&s;ide ye&s;terday evening, and &s;carce one word did he &s;ay to me, but conver&s;ed with my papa about the winding of his river; egad!

<P>Mi&s;s Plinlimmon, the manufacturing of love in Wales may perhaps be as coar&s;e as a &s;ackcloth, but in this part of the world, the cupids of fa&s;hion weave the fine texture with a light and invi&s;ible hand.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the lea&s;t, a lifele&s;s frame does not impre&s;s me with any di&s;turbance; I drew Lady Fidget's dead monkey the other day without any kind of perturbation.</P>

<P>But, Mr. Fancy, do you make no di&s;|tinction between Lady Fidget's dead monkey, and the remains of my friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>As he was your friend, I re&s;pect him, but does your Lord&s;hip really think he is worthy of tho&s;e encomiums, that you and Mr. Tomb&s;tone, &s;o profu&s;ely be&s;towed upon him?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps as much as your Lord&s;hip, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible with &s;o refined an under&s;tanding as yours to receive any entertainment from his writ|ings; the characters in his plays, for example, may be compared to the incongruities that we meet with on &s;ign-po&s;ts: things that never exi&s;ted in nature, &s;uch as blue boars, black &s;wans, dragons, and mermaids&mdash;I never felt a more plea&s;ing invi|tation to a &s;lumber, than I did at his la&s;t comedy, which unfortunately I did not enjoy long, for I was rou&s;ed by a thou&s;and cat-calls.</P>

<P>I beg I may be the negociator of peace between the living and the dead; in the fir&s;t place I can a&s;&s;ure Mr. Fancy no indignity was meant to him&mdash;Mr. Phren&s;y, for particular rea|&s;ons, having given out that he was dead, I thought a portrait of the author, by a celebrated painter, would add lu&s;tre to the po&s;thumous edition of his works.</P>

<P>It is part of his profe&s;&s;ion to talk the language of bomba&s;t, and inordinate adulation: It becomes my &s;ituation to &s;hew re&s;pect, a delicate re&s;erve, a genuine but not an importunate attach|ment, a calm not a tempe&s;tuous &s;olicitude; in one word, a &s;ilent adoration.</P>

<P>It is only changing the local re&s;em|blance, it is at the wor&s;t a &s;kilful and elegant inac|curacy; the beauty-&s;pot is there, I make no ad|dition to what nature has already done, I only bring to the eye of admiration, what her Lady|&s;hip informs me nature has rather removed from the &s;ight.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mo&s;t &s;kilfully indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fancy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have taken a much greater licence than this, without feeling any reproach of con&s;ci|ence; for example, when I had the honor of draw|ing Lady Frizlerump, I broke the immea&s;urable length of her bald buff forehead, by introducing two moles and a patch, the patch you know is a thing ad libitum, and as I knew Lady Frizlerump had a mole on each &s;houlder, I removed them from their native &s;pot, (they were well worth the carriage) and I placed them in a more con&s;picuous &s;ituation; there is no great deceit in this, it is only
<PB N="28" REF="32">a kind of tran&s;planting, which ought to be as al|lowable in painting as in gardening.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well ladies, you perceive how &s;port-fully Mr. Fancy di&s;cour&s;es, he has a mind to give you a &s;pecimen of his manner of entertaining his company, when they are &s;itting to him.</P>

<P>It is not &s;o much attending to the intere&s;t of my friend, as it is con&s;ulting the intere&s;t of the nation, while I am preparing this noble edi|tion of his works for the general delight.</P>

<SP>

<P>Mr. Tomb&s;tone, you alarm me! I had no idea of degrading you friend. I will pro|mote the &s;ub&s;cription among all my acquaintance, and do every thing in my power to atone for my &s;eeming di&s;re&s;pect.</P>

<P>Perfectly! Here is Hymen, with a torch in his hand, that is, I &s;uppo&s;e to light the bride and bridegroom home. And the dear little cupids I &s;uppo&s;e, foretell the children.</P>

<P>Very true. I am certain Lady Bellair would perform miracles on my daughter&mdash; if &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why, Sir Pepper, do you doubt my inclination?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e you, fine ladies, di&s;like trou|ble. I will be bold to &s;ay, that in the cour&s;e of the winter, you never do any thing your inclina|tion, that is to &s;ay, your vanity does not prompt you to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a&s;k your pardon, Sir Pepper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indulge for once an old man's cu|rio&s;ity, and edify me by recording &s;ome in&s;tances where you act in oppo&s;ition to the dictates of your inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a perfect challenge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let me recollect. I go every other Sunday, in the early part of the evening to
<PB N="59" REF="63">an old aunt, who lives at the Antipodes of the fa&s;h|ionable part of the town, and there I retail to her the hi&s;toric &s;candal of the fortnight; and then &s;he reads to me through her green &s;pectacles, out of a folio, a &s;ermon of the la&s;t century.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir Pepper, you will give Lady Bellair &s;ome credit for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I go once in the winter to the Ancient Mu&s;ic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, I &s;uppo&s;e, is a concert per|formed by the decayed mu&s;icians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not exactly &s;o; it is, however, a very edifying concert, and compo&s;ed of tho&s;e hoary, venerable notes, that in days of yore delighted the ears of Harry the eighth and Anne Bullen, and is now a very &s;uitable recreation for old batchelors, old maids, and emigrant nuns! But to continue the narrative of my mortified inclination: my carriage every morning makes one of the long proce&s;&s;ion of coaches that be&s;iege the circulating library in Bond Street.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>That denotes your Lady&s;hip's fondne&s;s for literature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg yor pardon, Sir Pepper, litera|ture is my aver&s;ion; I never look into a book, but I cannot avoid calling every morning at the library; it is a kind of literary tavern, where the waiters are in perpetual demand. A di&s;h of ele|gant &s;onnets for Mi&s;s Simper; &s;atires with a poig|nant &s;auce for Mrs. Grumble; a &s;irloin of hi&s;tory for Lady Sleeple&s;s; a broil'd devil of private anec|dote, highly peppered with &s;candal, for Lady An|gelica Worthle&s;s. It would amu&s;e you, Sir Pep|per, to &s;ee the&s;e female academics enter the porch of Hookham College, their cheeks, paled by &s;tu|dy, a little relieved by a thin &s;tratum of morning rouge. Then you would wonder at the method the learned profe&s;&s;ors adopt of &s;upplying the im|patience of their pupils: for example&mdash;one lady
<PB N="60" REF="64">receives the fir&s;t volume of an author, of which &s;he will never enquire for the &s;econd; at the &s;ame time &s;he receives the &s;econd volume of another author, of which &s;he has not yet an idea of the fir&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me leave to ob&s;erve, this vague method of reading mu&s;t create a kind of chaos, without con&s;i&s;tency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Con&s;i&s;tency is a vulgar word, we do not admit into our vocabulary; and as for the chaos you di&s;approve of, I really think there is to be found the whole merit; for this mi&s;cellaneous, variegated, unconnected reading, forms the beautiful dove|tailed, mo&s;aic literature of the female mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will allow Lady Plin|limmon to be a brilliant exception to your general de&s;cription.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mo&s;t undoubtedly; I have a long li&s;t of exceptions. But not to interrupt the narrative of my own memoirs&mdash;I am &s;ometimes obliged to mingle with the elegant mob at a &s;ale of pic|tures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>A &s;ale of pictures mu&s;t be very improving. You there frequently meet with the works of the old ma&s;ters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ladies of fa&s;hion do not go to auctions for the &s;ake of the <HI>old</HI> ma&s;ters; do they, Lord Melcourt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed! A bow from Lord Gauze, a &s;mile from Lord Flim&s;y, or a compliment from Sir Go&s;&s;amer Bagatelle, effaces the names of Rembrant, Corregio, and Vandyke!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, we play with the catalogue, and we &s;tare at the pictures. And I have heard it ob&s;erved, that in the two late celebrated &s;ales, the love of Vert&uacute; made the ladies gaze at &s;ome pictures, from which their grand-mammas would have turned away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="61" REF="65">
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, I will &s;ay for the ladies, that they &s;tole a glance at the&s;e pictures, through the medium of their long veils, which you know tran&s;|mits a kind of drapery, to the paintings! But to proceed, I am under the obligation, &s;ometimes, of getting up in the middle of the night, to be in readine&s;s, to go to a new play, and with all my precaution, I never can get there before the middle of the &s;econd act.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very unlucky.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the lea&s;t; for I never li&s;ten to the play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not your talking loud in the fir&s;t row, di&s;turb the audience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never occupy the fir&s;t row; I place the old ladies, in the fir&s;t and &s;econd row, they have nothing to do, (poor things) but to li&s;ten to the play? And then I &s;it &s;nug on the la&s;t form, which we call among our&s;elves, tattle row, and then perhaps, I am &s;eated between Sir Voluble Prattle, and Colonel Ea&s;y, and we three conver&s;e and titter <HI>a la &s;ourdine,</HI> the whole evening: but I am afraid I grow dull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the rever&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you; I pre&s;ume, your Lady&s;hip pays more attention to the opera; the &s;oftne&s;s of the Italian language, has &s;omething enchanting to a delicate ear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing of the Italian lan|guage, there is no attaining the knowledge of it, without pa&s;&s;ing through the perplexing, jumbling, cro&s;s-roads of a grammar; that would &s;hake my intellects to pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still the mu&s;ic may flatter the ear, though you do not comprehend the words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I comprehend the mu&s;ic as little as I do the words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, then, the dancing I conclude delights you&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="62" REF="66">
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; the dancing does not particularly intere&s;t me; indeed I cannot &s;ee the dancing in my box, for I generally &s;it with my back to the &s;tage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>As neither the mu&s;ic, nor the dancing has any allurement, I &s;uppo&s;e your Lady|&s;hip &s;eldom or never goes to the opera.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a&s;k your pardon, Sir Pepper, I never omit an opera.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir P. Plin.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then can be the attraction? I really &s;ee nothing to entice you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it nothing, Sir Pepper, to lean half out of one's box; with the head inclined to give the ea&s;y feather a more graceful play? which looks a meteor, waving in the air; and which, as the poet &s;ays,
<Q><L>"Allures attention, from the tuneful &s;cene;</L>
<L>"Gives fops the flutter, and old maids the &s;pleen."</L></Q>
Is it nothing, Sir Pepper, to have all the opera gla&s;&s;es levelled at one? To &s;it in my box, as on a throne, the unrivalled queen of Fopland?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Lady Bellair, you have an exten&s;ive dominion; Fopland is a very populous country.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is, and what is &s;till better, there is not an old man to be found in it.</P>
</SP>

<P>I am &s;orry, I am excluded from being one of your maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects?</P>

<P>Out of regard to your gallantry, I will introduce a bill to naturali&s;e you, Sir Pepper, but not to lo&s;e the thread of my narrative, I mu&s;t in|form you, that I go once in the winter to an a&s;&s;em|bly, given by the wife of my phy&s;ician; there all his pale convale&s;cents &s;talk about like gho&s;ts;</P>

<P>The playful gaiety of your di&s;po&s;i|tion led me a&s;tray, and I thought you was delighted to return to &s;ociety unaccompanied by Lord Bell|air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I have the appearance of airine&s;s and levity; but my gaiety is frequently a&s;&s;umed, and I have recour&s;e to di&s;&s;ipation more as a medicine than a fea&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fa&s;h.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you are &s;o kind as to &s;peak to me in &s;o unre&s;erved a manner, I think it incumbent on me to declare that I have no inbred aver&s;ion to the girl. I am not &s;o fa&s;tidious, &s;o difficult, as Melcourt; and I will add, that was I to &s;ucceed, I would do every thing in my power to contribute to her happine&s;s, and give me al&s;o leave to &s;ay that I believe I am not indifferent to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady B.</SPEAKER>
<P>With &s;uch honorable &s;entiments as you now a&s;&s;ure me you entertain, you have my permi&s;&s;ion to make the trial. Mutual propen&s;ity, believe me, is the be&s;t &s;ecurity for happine&s;s. The &s;miling flowers &s;he &s;catters from her hand can alone enliven the dome&s;tic walk! 'Tis &s;he who di&s;plays to the bride and bridegroom that eternal &s;pring which all lovers talk of, but which &s;o few expe|rience! 'Tis &s;he who gilds and di&s;&s;ipates the clouds of care, and pours upon the &s;oul the chear|ful &s;un&s;hine of the mind.</P>

<P>Yes, I do, as &s;oon as I have, by means of my &s;ub&s;cription) completed my poetical loan; my return to life will be a kind of an ova|tion: the triumphal proce&s;&s;ion &s;hall begin with my odes, each on his fiery Pega&s;us; my &s;atires, like tomahawks, &s;hall next appear; then my ele|gies &s;hall move like a weeping train of female captives, to the&s;e &s;hall &s;ucceed my epigrams, a bri&s;k troop of archers, with their pointed darts; my grand epic like a large unwieldy elephant, &s;hall march by it&s;elf: then my tragedies, attired as widows, &s;hall walk on one &s;ide, while my gaily ve&s;ted comedies &s;hall trip on the other.</P>

<BYLINE>BY THE RIGHT HON. FIELD MARSHAL CONWAY.</BYLINE>

<STAGE>Spoken by Mi&s;s Farren.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>WITH gloomy bodings for his bantling play,</L>
<L>Our Author came to me the other day,</L>
<L>A boon to a&s;k, tho' half afraid to break it;</L>
<L>He'd got an Epilogue, and I mu&s;t &s;peak it.&mdash;</L>
<L>All means he fain would try, if not too late,</L>
<L>Still to avert his dread, impending fate.</L>
<L>Sad vi&s;ions, too, di&s;tract his anxious brain;</L>
<L>Rumours of ills, that wait the &s;cribbling train.</L>
<L>'Tis &s;aid your ta&s;te for Comedy is flown;</L>
<L>That darling child you once were proud to own:</L>
<L>That Shake&s;pear's fires no more your &s;en&s;es rouze;</L>
<L>Congreve and Vanbrugh &s;eldom fill the hou&s;e;</L>
<L>While childi&s;h pageants &s;tuff the crouded &s;cene,</L>
<L>No mortal even gue&s;&s;ing what they mean;</L>
<L>Fierce wars they wage, and dreadful battles try,</L>
<L>With bloodle&s;s conflict: all one knows not why.</L>
<L>Till by the friendly banners we are told,</L>
<L>There Macedon's, there Per&s;ia's chief behold!</L>
<L>Ju&s;t as on &s;igns th' informing words declare,</L>
<L>This the Red Lion; that is the Black Bear.</L>
<L>Queens, and their maids of honor, wait in vain.</L>
<L>Till their mute lovers &s;hall their &s;uit explain.</L>
<L>They'd often heard, indeed from Greece and Rome,</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="83">That love was blind; but ne'er that he was dumb.</L>
<L>There too tho&s;e motly, female, manly graces,</L>
<L>With almo&s;t all things naked, but their faces;</L>
<L>Tho&s;e modern Picts, at whom we gaze with wonder;</L>
<L>While their keen falchions cut whole ranks a&s;under.</L>
<L>Great Ru&s;ty-fu&s;ti's triumphs thus we greet;</L>
<L>Six holy Roman emp'rors breathle&s;s at her feet.</L>
<L>Nor le&s;s the neighb'ring temples of Apollo,</L>
<L>With equal &s;teps the bright example follow.</L>
<L>There beardle&s;s warriors &s;queak each other's doom;</L>
<L>And &s;ilken Vandals plan the fall of Rome.</L>
<L>There demigods by entrech&acirc;ts advance,</L>
<L>And Carthage flames demoli&s;h'd in a dance.</L>
<L>Arms cla&s;h, loud thunders roar, and chariots rattle;</L>
<L>While jarring trumpets animate the battle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now critics, if you're angry think on the&s;e,</L>
<L>And &s;pare the bard who &s;trives at lea&s;t to plea&s;e:</L>
<L>Judge, and be judg'd, in anger ju&s;t, I pray:</L>
<L><HI>Audire alteram partem</HI> is fair play.</L>
<L>In &s;uch a cau&s;e, altho' the ta&s;k be hard;</L>
<L>I'll be my&s;elf of coun&s;el for our bard;</L>
<L>I've &s;uch authorities as none refu&s;es,</L>
<L>Fleta's, and Coke's, and Black&s;tone's of the Mu&s;es;</L>
<L>Farqhuar and Rowe, and Wycherly we boa&s;t!</L>
<L>And Avon's mighty &s;eer, him&s;elf a ho&s;t!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, for I feel my female fears increa&s;e,</L>
<L>Tho' arm'd for war, <HI>yet &s;till I wi&s;h</HI> for peace:</L>
<L>We own your pow'r, confe&s;s your wond'rous &s;way,</L>
<L>Whom all our great dramatic realms obey:</L>
<L><PB N="80" REF="84" MS="y">No merit we can claim, till you befriend it,</L>
<L>Wit is not wit, unle&s;s your ta&s;te commend it:</L>
<L>From th' Author's anvil a mere &s;luggi&s;h ma&s;s;</L>
<L>Your plaudits &s;tamp the coin, and bid it pa&s;s.</L>
<L>By your mild &s;entence then decide our fate:</L>
<L>Far better to be good than to be great!</L>
<L>Like Britain's Monarch, act your generous parts,</L>
<L>And fix your empire, in our greatful hearts.</L>
