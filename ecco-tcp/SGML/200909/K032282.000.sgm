<HEAD>The CLAIMS of the People of ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, (anno 1701, 12 W. III.) a &s;en&s;ible and loyal Writer drew up a &s;mall Tract of political information, which he intitled &mdash; <Q>THE CLAIMS OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND <HI>e&s;&s;ayed in a Letter from the Country.</HI></Q> But, before the Tract was printed, the Author had the &s;atisfaction to hear, that the <HI>Claims,</HI> he had a&s;&s;erted, were in many re&s;pects e&s;tabli&s;hed by a new Act of the Parliament then &s;itting; which &s;ea|&s;onable attention to the People's <HI>Rights</HI> he mo&s;t gratefully acknowledged in a Po&s;t|&s;cript to his Letter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Act of Settlement,</HI> by virtue of which the pre&s;ent Royal Family &s;ucceeded to the Crown of the&s;e Realms, was the Statute, which then &s;o happily (in the opinion of that Writer) <Q>&s;ecured THE CLAIMS OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.</Q></P>
<P>It is intitled, <Q><HI>An Act for the farther Limitation of the Crown, and better &s;e|curing the Rights and Liberties of the Subject;</HI></Q> &mdash; and accordingly contains
<PB N="4" REF="3">eight very excellent Articles of <HI>Limitation,</HI> agreeable to <Q><HI>the Claims of the People of England;</HI></Q> which, it &s;eems, were en|acted, <Q><HI>with the unanimous Concurrence of both Hou&s;es of Parliament,</HI></Q> for the ex|pre&s;s purpo&s;e of <Q><HI>&s;ecuring our Religion, Laws, and Liberties.</HI></Q></P>
<P>One of the&s;e Articles ordained&mdash;"That" <Q>&mdash;<HI>all matters and things relating to the well governing of this</HI> Kingdom, <HI>which are properly cognizable in the Privy Coun|cil by the Laws and Cu&s;toms of this Realm, &s;hall be tran&s;acted there, and all Re&s;olu|tions taken thereupon &s;hall be &s;igned by &s;uch of the Privy Council as &s;hall advi&s;e and con&s;ent to the &s;ame.</HI></Q><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">This excellent provi&s;ion would effectually prevent any <HI>&s;ecret Council,</HI> or Faction, from becoming <HI>efficient without Re&s;pon&s;ibility.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>And by another of the&s;e Articles it was ordained &mdash; <Q><HI>That no per&s;on, who has an Office, or Place of profit, under the King, or receives a Pen&s;ion from the Crown, &s;hall be capable of &s;erving as a Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons.</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It might perhaps have been objected at that time, as well as at pre&s;ent, that &s;uch a <HI>total exclu&s;ion of Place|men</HI> would withdraw from Parliament the Council and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of many worthy Men <HI>in Office,</HI> (or that ought to be <HI>in Office,</HI>) who&s;e parliamentary Abilities are the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed and eminent in the Kingdom. Yet there is and obvious an&s;wer to this objection, viz. That it is very ea&s;y for a free Parliament (if in their wi&s;dom they &s;hall think it proper) to permit the <HI>great Officers of State,</HI> or even <HI>their Secretaries or fir&s;t Clerks</HI> to have &s;eats in Parliament, and, as Members, not only to declare their opinions, but al&s;o, for the better information of the Hou&s;e, even to <HI>debate</HI> and <HI>reply</HI> upon all que&s;tions relating to public affairs; which might be allowed without any dangerous effect, pro|vided they are duly re&s;trained from the &s;ingle privilege of VOTING. The Nation by this means may have ample be|nefit in the exerci&s;e of their great and &s;hining abilities, without ri&s;que of <HI>undue influence,</HI> which cannot ju&s;tly be attributed to mere <HI>argument,</HI> as that has no other weight or effect than what is fairly due to its merit; and any unrea|&s;onable <HI>length of &s;peech,</HI> whenever it is u&s;ed with an appa|rent intention to procra&s;tinate and ob&s;truct the intention of the Majority, may be duly re&s;trained at the plea&s;ure of the Hou&s;e. But otherwi&s;e, (i. e. without &s;ome due re&s;triction, and, more e&s;pecially, <HI>without an ab&s;olute exclu&s;ion from the power of voting,</HI>) a TREASURY BENCH, or any other BENCH OF PLACEMEN, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, is a <HI>manife&s;t</HI> ABOMINATION, utterly repugnant to all ju&s;t Ideas of a <HI>free uninfluenced Parliament,</HI> and con&s;equently is highly derogatory to the honour of that Hou&s;e!</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">But, as the Parliament was at that time inve&s;ted with the dangerous uncon&s;titutio|nal power of a <HI>triennial</HI> duration without <HI>Re|election,</HI> it was impo&s;&s;ible that the <HI>Elected</HI> (who thereby acquired a temporary indepen|dency of the <HI>Electors,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, too ma|ny of them, a <HI>&s;eparate intere&s;t</HI> of their own) could long continue <HI>real</HI> Repre&s;entatives of the <HI>People's Claims;</HI> and, con&s;equently, the&s;e two mo&s;t excellent provi&s;ions again&s;t <HI>undue influence</HI> were unhappily repealed, a very
<PB N="6" REF="5">few years afterwards, in the 4th year of Queen Anne (c. 8.) Which amply proves, that the mo&s;t &s;alutary provi&s;ions for <Q><HI>the Claims of the people</HI></Q> cannot be &s;ecurely e&s;tabli&s;hed under <HI>triennial</HI> or <HI>&s;eptennial</HI> Par|liaments; and, of cour&s;e, that the antient u&s;age of <HI>&s;e&s;&s;ional</HI> ELECTIONS is a <HI>Claim,</HI> of all others the mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for our welfare.</P>
<P>Since the fatal repeal above mentioned, the prevalence of <HI>undue influence</HI> hath &s;o rapidly and enormou&s;ly increa&s;ed, that the ever-loyal Citizens of London thought it their duty, in the year 1770, to bear te&s;ti|mony again&s;t it; and accordingly they a&s;&s;ert|ed, in a public declaration to the King him|&s;elf, that <HI>"the"</HI> (then) <Q><HI>Hou&s;e of Commons did</HI> NOT <HI>repre&s;ent the people.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>Repre&s;entatives of the People are e&s;&s;ential to the making of Laws, and there is a Time when it is morally demon&s;trable that Men cea&s;e to be Repre&s;entatives. That Time is now arrived. THE PRESENT HOUSE OF COMMONS DO NOT REPRESENT THE PEOPLE.</Q> &mdash;Addre&s;s of the Mayor, Aldermen, &amp;c. of the City of London, 1770.</NOTE></P>
<P>Sub&s;equent Facts have demon&s;trated the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity we are now under to <HI>claim</HI> and promote an <HI>unequivocal</HI> abolition of all <HI>undue Influence</HI> in Parliament.</P>
<P>Mea&s;ures, the mo&s;t <HI>unrighteous,</HI> as well as the mo&s;t <HI>ruinous</HI> that could have been de|vi&s;ed,
<PB N="7" REF="6">have been adopted and carried on under a pretended &s;anction of <HI>parliamentary Authority,</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">This mu&s;t of cour&s;e be under&s;tood to refer (if you plea&s;e) only to <HI>former</HI> Parliaments that began the Mi&s;chief, who&s;e <HI>pretended Sanction</HI> had more of the <HI>Name</HI> than the <HI>Reality</HI> of <HI>parliamentary Authority,</HI> if a <HI>real Repre&s;entation of the Commons</HI> be at all e&s;&s;ential to con&s;titute a true <HI>legal Par|liament.</HI>
<P>The Repre&s;entatives are cho&s;en by a <HI>very &s;mall Propor|tion</HI> of the People, and even that <HI>&s;mall Proportion</HI> of People is &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly <HI>unequal</HI> in their <HI>power of delegation,</HI> that the &s;mall Number of 5723 Borough Voters elect 254 Re|pre&s;entatives, which is very near <HI>half</HI> the Number of Re|pre&s;entatives that are due to &s;ix Millions of People, and <HI>more than half,</HI> or a <HI>Majority,</HI> of the Numbers that are ever known to attend at any one Time. The INJUSTICE of &s;uch an <HI>enormous Di&s;proportion</HI> in the Repre&s;entation of the whole People cannot be parallelled by any other gro&s;s Ab|&s;urdity, except THE INIQUITY of rendering that <HI>di&s;pro|portionate Repre&s;entation</HI> &s;till more contemptible and nuga|tory by SEPTENNIAL or (what were nearly as pernicious) TRIENNIAL, in&s;tead of the ancient con&s;titutional U&s;age of SESSIONAL, ELECTIONS.</P></NOTE> which have involved both King and People (who&s;e true intere&s;ts are in&s;eparable) in the mo&s;t alarming difficul|ties: and the o&s;ten&s;ible Agents in the mi&s;|chief have ob&s;tinately per&s;evered to the ut|mo&s;t exten&s;ion of <HI>ability,</HI> until public Di|&s;a&s;ters, and a happy preventive incapacity of their own, (their Heads and Funds being equally exhau&s;ted of council and re&s;ource,) have compelled them to make a temporary retreat; though the nu|merous
<PB N="8" REF="7">Corps of Placemen, Pen&s;ioners, Contractors, &amp;c. occa&s;ionally procured them a &s;hameful Majority almo&s;t to the la&s;t!</P>
<P>Hence it is evident that the <HI>Corruption of Parliament</HI> is the real &s;ource of all our national calamities and grievances, which cannot therefore be relieved by a <HI>mere change of Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Minority</HI> in Parliament hath once before, in the memory of mo&s;t men, be|come the <HI>Majority;</HI> and the worthy Op|po&s;ers of bad mea&s;ures were indulged with a temporary admini&s;tration of public Affairs, until the &s;ecret <HI>efficient Cabinet</HI> could reco|ver from the &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;may of their former defeat in Parliament, and, by a renewed exertion of their <HI>undue influence,</HI> were able to &s;hackle the new Admini&s;tra|tion with the rueful alternative, either to abandon their newly-acquired dignities, or el&s;e to adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures as mu&s;t effec|tually deprive them of the people's confi|dence; after which they were contemp|tuou&s;ly compelled (one by one, or as it might be&s;t &s;uit the purpo&s;es of the reigning &s;y&s;tem of <HI>undue influence</HI>) to yield up their places for the emolument of the more pliant creatures of the &s;ecret faction.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">It would be madne&s;s for <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> af|ter &s;uch galling experience, to neglect their ju&s;t and indi&s;pen&s;ible <HI>Claim</HI> to &s;ome imme|diate and effectual precaution again&s;t &s;imilar <HI>delu&s;ions.</HI> To tru&s;t another new Admini&s;|tration, without in&s;i&s;ting at the &s;ame time on a con&s;titutional <HI>limitation of power,</HI> by a <HI>free uninfluenced Repre&s;entation of the Commons,</HI> may be dangerous to our very exi&s;tence as an independent Kingdom!</P>
<P>The reduced circum&s;tances of the Na|tion cannot admit the ri&s;que of another &s;uch credulous experiment!</P>
<P>It is therefore become ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary, for the &s;ecurity both of King and Peo|ple, (which includes the <HI>true intere&s;t</HI> of all parties,) that the ju&s;t <HI>"Claims of the Peo|ple"</HI> be &s;atisfied in an immediate Re&s;tora|tion of the antient <HI>legal</HI> and <HI>re&s;pon&s;ible</HI> Go|vernment, by a <HI>Revival</HI> of the two repealed Articles of the Act of Settlement, above recited, and by a <HI>Revival</HI> al&s;o of that mo&s;t excellent Statute for SESSIONAL PARLIA|MENTS, pa&s;&s;ed in the 4th of K.
