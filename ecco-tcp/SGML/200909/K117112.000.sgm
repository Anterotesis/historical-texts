<P>SOME apology may be required for my making &s;o free with an old favourite of yours. So many of you as are in the habit of admiring the <HI>&s;ublime performances</HI> of our Engli&s;h Pindar, will, do doubt, exclaim again&s;t me for a&s;&s;igning a po&s;t at Court, the mo&s;t humiliating of all others, to your darling Poet. But this is the very thing I intended: for this favourite of yours (like many other favourites) has been &s;poiled by too much indulgence, and is grown &s;o intolerably &s;aucy, that he ought to be taken down a little. But there may be others among you who will acknowledge P. Pindar to be fair game, and who may &s;ay that this gentle ca&s;tigation is not half &s;o much as he de&s;erves for that impudent mockery and caricature which he has &s;o often pointed at his S&mdash;n. To all &s;uch, it may not be ami&s;s to intimate, that I have another birch in &s;oak for Ma&s;ter Peter, which, I think, will give him a &s;mart flagellation. The few lines which I now hazard the publication of, are only meant as preparatory to the introduction of this other labour of my &s;portive Mu&s;e, provided that I find this my fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay is tolerably well received, and that it is acknowledged to be of &s;ufficient merit to intitle me, in &s;ome &s;mall degree, to the &s;igna|ture of</P>
