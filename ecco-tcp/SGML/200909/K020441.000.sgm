<P>TOM JONES, A COMIC OPERA: As it is Performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL IN COVENT-GARDEN.</P>
<P>By JOSEPH REED.</P>
<P>THE SECOND EDITION.</P>
<P>LONDON, Printed for BECKET and DE HONDT, in the Strand; and RICHARDSON and URQUHART, at the Royal Exchange.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is needle&s;s to &s;ay the following Opera is taken from FIELDING'S celebrated novel of <HI>Tom Jones;</HI> a production &s;o replete with wit, hu|mour, and character, that it can never want ad|mirers while the Engli&s;h language remains. My extreme veneration for the memory of the truly-witty and ingenious noveli&s;t, naturally led me to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> as much of FIELDING throughout my Opera, as the nature of my plan would allow. Nay, when it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;horten the piece, le&s;t it &s;hould be too long in repre&s;entation, I readily <HI>parted with my own,</HI> to <HI>retain</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible of the <HI>invaluable Original.</HI></P>
<P>I have made many material deviations from the novel, both in point of fable, and character. I have &s;tripp'd its hero of his libertini&s;m, to render him, as I imagined, more amiable and intere&s;ting; and have metamorphos'd Par&s;on <HI>Supple</HI> into a country '&s;quire, to avoid giving offence to the <HI>cloth.</HI> The characters of <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> I have dive&s;ted of their provinciality; le&s;t the at|tention of the performers, to the pronunciation of an uncouth and difficult dialect, &s;hould produce an <HI>Inattention</HI> to the more material bu&s;ine&s;s of the drama. I have al&s;o endeavoured to purge We&s;|tern's character of its coar&s;ene&s;s and indelicacy, in conformity to the refined ta&s;te of the pre&s;ent age; and of its Jacobiti&s;m, from an opinion that &s;uch political &s;ect no longer exi&s;ts, as well as from
<PB REF="4">a conviction that nothing of party &s;hould ever ap|pear within the walls of a theatre.</P>
<P>While I was writing the la&s;t act of this Opera (which was in June, 1765), the <HI>French</HI> Tom Jones fell into my hands. I found its plan &s;o very confined, and &s;o materially different from mine, that I could reap little or no benefit from it. The only particulars, of which I have availed my|&s;elf from Mon&s;. POINSINET, are the hint of <HI>legi|timating</HI> Jones, and the thought, which gave ri&s;e to my <HI>&s;econd</HI> air. I have quoted the lines, from which I received advantage in the latter in&s;tance:</P>
<Q><L>Que les devoirs que tu m'impo&s;es,</L>
<L>Tri&s;te rai&s;on, ont de rigueur!</L>
<L>Tu g&eacute;mis, Sophie, &amp; tu n'o&s;es</L>

<P>Nothing, ma'am. He's not a proper match for you to be &s;ure: with your fortune you may command one of the greate&s;t lords of the land; therefore you won't cer|tainly &s;toop to marry a beggar and a foundling.</P>

<P>Ma'am, if it was a di&s;grace, Mr. Jones has a great many people, that carry their heads very high, to keep him in countenance&mdash;well, he's one of the &s;weete&s;t gentlemen that ever trod on &s;hoe-leather! Every body likes him: all the neighbourhood, for five miles round, would run through fire and water for him&mdash;if I were in your cloaths, and he loved me, as much as I believe he loves you&mdash;</P>

<P>Loves me, Honour! I don't under&s;tand you.</P>

<P>Ma'am, I may be mi&s;taken, it's true; becau&s;e, as the man &s;ays, we can be &s;ure of nothing in this world but death and taxes: however I could tell you &s;omething, that looks very like it.</P>

<P>He came into the room, as I was &s;itting at work, and what &s;hould be upon the table but the muff you gave me, and my gentleman whips his hands into it. "La, Mr. Jones, you'll &s;poil it," &s;ays I; but he &s;till kept his hands in it, and ki&s;s'd it, and mumbled it, and ki&s;s'd it&mdash;for my part I never &s;aw &s;uch ki&s;&s;es in my life as he gave it.</P>

<P>Let me &s;ee&mdash;it was the day after I dreamt that I was married to Sir Timothy Tipple&mdash;la&s;t Thur&s;day&mdash;ay it was on Thur&s;day.&mdash;But that is not all neither&mdash;ye&s;terday, as you were playing on the harp&s;ichord, he was in the next room, and look'd melancholly&mdash;&s;ays I, "What's the matter, Mr.
