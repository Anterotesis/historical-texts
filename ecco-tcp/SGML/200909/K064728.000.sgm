<P>THE APPRENTICE. A FARCE, IN TWO ACTS, As it is Perform'd at the THEATRE-ROYAL, in <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was Room to apprehend, be|fore the Repre&s;entation of the following Farce, that the Subject might appear extravagant and merely ideal; but the real ex|i&s;tence of it is di&s;played in &s;uch a lively and picture&s;que Manner by the Author of the Prologue, and was at once &s;o univer&s;ally felt by the Audience, that all nece&s;&s;ity of &s;aying any thing farther on this Head is now entirely &s;uper&s;eded. What at pre&s;ent remains to be feared, is, that the <HI>Apprentice</HI> will not make &s;o lively a figure in the clo&s;et, as on the Stage, where the Parts in general were allow|ed to be well performed; where <HI>Simon</HI> was re|pre&s;ented with a perfection of folly, where the Skill of Mr. <HI>Yates</HI> exhibited the Impo|tence of a Mind, who&s;e Ideas extend very little beyond the multiplication Table, and who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions are ever in a crazy Conflict, unle&s;s when they all &s;ub&s;ide into a &s;ordid Love of Gain; and where Mr. <HI>Woodward's</HI> admirable comic Genius gave &s;uch a Spirit to the whole, that there is Rea&s;on to think, when|ever he relinqui&s;hes the Part, the <HI>Apprentice</HI> may again elope from his Friends, without any one's de&s;iring him to Return to his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Author has however endeavoured to render all its Defects as excu&s;able as he could, and he wi&s;hes no &s;tronger Critici&s;m could be brought again&s;t him, than the two following Ob&s;ervations, which he thinks very &s;ingular and &s;omewhat entertaining. <Q><HI>I can't,</HI> &s;ays one, <HI>give my Opinion of the Piece, till I have</HI>
<PB REF="3">
Time to con&s;ider the Depth of it</Q>&mdash;<Q><HI>Po!</HI> &s;ays another, <HI>this is not all his</HI> OWN, <HI>I remember some of it in other Plays.</HI></Q>&mdash;In order to a&s;&s;i&s;t the former in his deep Re&s;earches, and to enable the latter to make good his charge of Plagia|ri&s;m, References are made to the &s;everal Plays, from which the di&s;tempered Hero of the piece makes up his motley, but characteri&s;tick Dia|lect. The intelligent Reader, if he think it worth his while to turn over the&s;e Leaves, will be plea&s;ed to remember that a Parody does not always carry with it a Burle&s;que on the Lines al|luded to. For (as it is judiciou&s;ly remarked in a note to Mr. <HI>Pope's</HI> Dunciad) <Q><HI>It is a common, but fooli&s;h, mi&s;take that a ludicrous Parody of a grave and celebrated Pa&s;&s;age; is a Ridicule of that Pa&s;&s;age. A Ridicule indeed there is in every Parody, but where the Image is transfer|red from one Object to another, there the Ri|dicule falls not on the Thing</HI> imitated, <HI>but</HI> imitating. <HI>Thus for In&s;tance, when</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Line of pope's in a ludicrous Account of the coronation in Henry the VIIIth.</NOTE> <HI>Old Edward's Armour beams on Cibbers Brea&s;t.</HI> It is without Doubt an Object ridiculous enough; but then, I think, <HI>it falls neither on old King</HI> Edward, <HI>nor his</HI> Armour, <HI>but on his</HI> Armour-Bearer <HI>only.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But this is prefacing a Farce as if it were a Thing of moment; I &s;hall therefore di&s;mi&s;s it to the Pre&s;s, without adding any Thing far|ther, except my grateful Acknowledgements for the very favourable Reception, with which the Public has honoured the trifling Scenes of</P>
