<P>"This shell," says Pennant, "is noted for producing quantities of pearl. There have been regular fisheries for the sake of this pre|cious article in several of our rivers. Sixteen have been found in one shell. They are the disease of the fi&s;h analogous to the stone in the human body. On being squeezed, they will eject the pearl, and often cast it spontaneously in the sand of the stream.</P>
<P>"The Conway was noted for them in the days of Camden. A notion also prevails that Sir Richard Wynne, of Gwydir, chamber|lain
<PB REF="5">to Catherine queen to Charles II. presented her majesty with a pearl (taken in this river) which is to this day honoured with a place in the regal crown. They are called by the Welsh Cregin Diluw, or Deluge Shells, as if left there by the flood.</P>
<P>"The Irt, in Cumberland, was also productive of them. The famous circumnavigator, Sir John Hawkins, had a patent for fishing that river. He had observed pearls plentiful in the straits of Magel|lan, and flattered himself with being enriched by procuring them within his own island.</P>
<P>"In the last century, several of great size were gotten in the rivers in the county of Tyrone and Donegal, in Ireland. One weighed thirty-six <HI>carats,</HI> was valued at 40 l. but being foul lost much of its worth. Other single pearls were sold for 4 l. 10 s. and even for 10 l. The last was sold a second time to lady Glenlealy, who put it into a necklace, and refused 80 l. for it from the duchess of Ormond."</P>
<P>"Suetonius reports, that Caesar was induced to undertake his British expedition for the sake of our pearls; and that they were so large that it was necessary to use the hand to try the weight of a single one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sueton. Vit. Jul. Caes. <HI>c. lxiv.</HI></NOTE>. I imagine Caesar only heard this by report; and that the crystaline balls in old leases, called mineral pearl, were mistaken for them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Woodward's Method of Fossils, 29. part 2.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>"We believe that Caesar was disappointed of his hope: yet we are told that he brought home a buckler made with British pearl<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plinii, lib. <HI>9.</HI> c. <HI>35.</HI> Tacit. Vit. Agric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lae.</NOTE>, which
<PB REF="6">he dedicated to, and hung up in the temple of Venus Genetrix. A proper offering to the goddess of beauty, who sprung from the sea. I cannot omit mentioning, that notwithstanding the classics honour our pearl with their notice, yet they report them to be small and ill coloured; an imputation that in general they are still liable to. Pliny says, "that a red small kind was found about the Thracian Bospho|rus, in a shell called Mya, but does not give it any mark to ascertain the species."</P>
<P>The Mya Margaritifera is found only in great rivers, and chiefly in those of the northern parts of Great Britain. Da Costa mentions the Tees, Alne, North and South Tyne, Tweed, Dee, Don, &amp;c. and adds, generally inhabits the deeper parts, as gulphs, whirlpools, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The fishermen in the neighbourhood of the river Conway some|times collect those shells, and extract the pearl, but as they are now become scarce, and the price inconsiderable, the fishery affords them little encouragement.</P>

<P>Da Costa notices a material error amongst the synonyms Lin|naeus has given with his description of Venus Mercenaria. The Venus Mercenaria of Linnaeus is the shell called North American Clam, and of which the Wampum, or indian money, is made; this is not the species found on our coast and figured by Lister, p. 173. as Linnaeus imagined, but a shell altogether distinct; the English species Lister notices, is the true Venus Islandica of the Linnaean <HI>Systema Naturae.</HI></P>
<P>This error has misled Pennant, who confounds the North American kind with our species, at least as a variety having a purple tinge within it. Gmelin was aware of this mistake, for in his edition of the Systema Naturae, both the plates and descriptions of Pen|nant and Da Costa are referred to in the synonyms of Venus Islandica.</P>
<P>This shell is perfectly white when fine, and is thickly covered with a fibrous epidermis of a black, or brownish colour. Found on several of our coasts. Da Costa mentions Northumberland, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Dorsetshire, Caernarvonshire, and other shores of Wales. Aberdeenshire, and the islands of Orkney, &amp;c. in Scotland.</P>

Animal Limax. Shell rather convoluted at one end, sub-oval. Aperture oblong.</P>

<P>BULLA RESILIENS: ovalis, pellucida, vi resiliendi praedita, spira, subdepressa anfractibus canaliculatus.</P>
<P>This interesting species of Bulla, which has lately been found in Devonshire, and considered as a new discovery, was first in|troduced to the notice of English Conchologists by the Rev. Mr. Cordiner. He discovered them some years ago on the shores of Bamff, and sent them, with several others, disposed in a grotto work, as a present to the late Duchess of Portland. Since that time they have been found at Lymington, in Hampshire, by
<PB REF="21">Mr. Keate; and lastly, during the summer months of 1800, was taken in a moat near Portsmouth, by J. Laskey, Esq. of Cre|diton, who favoured us with some particulars respecting the ani|mal inhabiting it. In a young state, he says, it has the appear|ance of a winged insect, and sports in its watery element with all the liveliness of a butterfly, and formed a pleasing object when kept alive in a glass of sea water. It seems to prefer little pools, or still waters within reach of the tide, to more exposed situations.</P>
<P>In general the specimens that have been found at Portsmouth are very small, the shell from which the upper figure is copied far exceeding the others in size. This species, though very thin and brittle, is yet so elastic as to bear much compression with|out injury, and in this respect differs from every other British species of Bulla already known. Amongst the foreign kinds are several eclastic kinds; and this very species is found of a much larger size in the Mediterranean Sea.&mdash;Independent of its elasticity, the convoluted apex is a material character of this shell, considered as a British species.</P>

<P>Pennant has named this species of Helix with some propriety the Exotic Snail, for, though it is found at this time in vast abundance in several parts of the country, it is not an indigenous kind. By whom it was first introduced is uncertain; Pennant mentions Sir Kenelm Digby, and Da Costa speaks of Charles Howard, Esq. of the Arundel family. Its history, as related by Da Costa, is so very interesting, that we shall give it in the words of its author:&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is the largest species of land snail in England, and is found in hedges and woods. It closes its shell carefully against winter, with a
<PB REF="37">white thick cover or operculum, dull and like plaister, and in the closed state it remains till the beginning of April, or warm weather, at which time it loosens the border of the cover, and the animal creeps out of the shell for its necessary occasions. Dr. Lister in|forms us he kept one in his bosom about the beginning of March, when the animal, feeling the warmth, in a few hours disengaged its cover, and crept out.</P>
<P>"The animal being large, fleshy, and not of an unpleasant taste, has been used for food in ancient times: it was a favourite dish with the Romans, who had their cochlearia, or snail stews, wherein they bred and fattened them. Pliny tells us, that the first inventor of this luxury was a Fulvius Harpinus, a little before the civil wars between Caesar and Pompey. Varro has handed down to us a description of the stews, and manner of making them: He says, open places were chose, surrounded by water, that the snails might not abandon them, and care was taken that the places were not much exposed to the sun, or to the dews. The artificial stews were generally made under rocks or eminences, whose bottoms were watered by lakes or rivers; and if a natural dew or moisture was not found, they formed an artificial one, by bringing a pipe to it bored full of holes, like a watering pot, by which the place was continually sprinkled or moistened. The snails required little attention or food, for as they crawled they found it on the floor or area, and on the walls or sides, if not hindered by the surrounding water. They were fed with bran and sodden lees of wines, or like substances, and a few laurel leaves were thrown on it.</P>
<P>"Pliny tells us there were many sorts, as the Whitish from Um|bria, the large sort from Dalmatia, and the African, &amp;c. This par|ticular
<PB REF="38">kind seems to be that he mentions, l. 8. c. 39. They propa|gate very much, and their spawn is very minute.</P>
<P>"Varro is scarcely to be credited, when he says, some would grow so large, that their shells held ten quarts.</P>
<P>"They were also fed and fattened in large pots or pans, stuck full of holes to let in the air, and lined with bran and sodden lees, or vegetables.</P>
<P>"They are yet used as food in several parts of Europe, more es|pecially during Lent, and are preserved in &s;tews or <HI>escargotoires,</HI> now a large place boarded in, and the floor covered with herbs, wherein they nestle and feed.</P>
<P>"In Italy, in many places, they are sold in the markets, and are called <HI>Bacoli, Martinacci</HI> and <HI>Gallinelle;</HI> in many provinces of France, as Narbonne, Franche Comt&eacute;, &amp;c. and even in Paris. They boil them, says Lister, in river water, and seasoning them with salt, pepper, and oil, make a hearty repast.</P>
<P>"This is not indigenous, or originally a native of these kingdoms, but a naturalized species, that has throve so well, as now to be found in very great quantities. It was first imported to us from Italy about the middle of last century, by a <HI>scavoir vivre,</HI> or epicure, as an article of food. Mr. Aubrey informs us, it was a Charles Howard, Esq. of the Arundel family, who, on that account, scattered and dispersed those snails all over the downs, and in the woods, &amp;c. at Albury, an ancient seat of that noble family, near Ashted, Boxhill, Dorking, and Ebbisham, or Epsom, in Surrey, where they have thriven so much that all that part of the county, even to the confines of Sussex,
<PB REF="39">abounds with them; insomuch that they are a nuisance, and far sur|pass in number the common, or any other species of English snails.</P>
<P>The Epicures, or <HI>scavoir vivre,</HI> of those days, followed this luxu|rious folly, and the snails were scattered or dispersed throughout the kingdom, but not with equal success; neither have records trans|mitted to posterity the fame of those worthies equal to the Roman Fulvius Harpinus, except of two, the one Sir Kenelm Digby, who dispersed them about Gothurst the seat of that family (now of the Wrights) near Newport Pagnel, in Buckinghamshire, where probably they did not thrive much, as they were not frequent thereabout: the other worthy was a lord Hatton, recorded by Mr. Morton, who scattered them in the coppices at his seat at Kirby, in Northampton|shire, where they did not succeed.</P>
<P>"Dr. Lister found them about Puckeridge and <HI>Ware,</HI> in Hert|fordshire; and observes, they are abundant in the Southern parts, but are not found in the northern parts of this island.</P>
<P>"In Surry, as before mentioned, they abound; in several other counties they are not uncommon, as in Oxfordshire, especially about Woodstock and Bladen; in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, in Chedworth parish, and about Frog Mill, in Dorsetshire, &amp;c. but I have never heard that they are yet met with in any of the northern counties."</P>

<P>Da Costa observes, that Linnaeus has placed this shell very impro|perly in the Tellina genus, as it does not agree with his own defini|tion of that genus, and remarks that its habit, shape, convexity, &amp;c. brings it nearer to the Cardium than any other kind.&mdash;It still remains a Tellina in the last edition of the <HI>Systema Naturae</HI> by Gmelin, and we are not disposed in the present instance to deviate from that authority.</P>
<P>This, and the Tellina rivalis described by Dr. Maton, in the Lin|naean Transactions, are very analogous, though evidently two distinct species, as we have before noticed in our description of the latter, Plate 62.&mdash;Tellina Cornea, according to Geoffroy, is a viviparous ani|mal, and is found in great plenty in most rivers and stagnant waters.</P>

<P>After comparing the numerous kinds of fresh water Myae found in different parts of the kingdom, the conchologist will perhaps be sur|prized at the small number we shall venture to admit as distinct species. The varieties of those Shells seem endless, and it may be
<PB REF="86">doubred whether they are not in general indebted to age, accident, or the peculiar qualities of the waters they inhabit, for those variations in general appearance that have been too frequently mistaken for cha|racteristic differences of species.</P>
<P>As the Myae will fall under consideration more fully hereafter, we shall for the present confine our remarks to the shell before us, and its very analogous kind, the Mya ovata of Dr. Solander.</P>
<P>This has been considered by some as a mere variety of ovata, and we confess our opinion is still wavering in assigning it a name and character as a new species. The Mya ovata has been lately found in the river Froome in Somersetshire, and likewise in the New River near London. What are usually deemed its varieties are numerous, but none of them can, we believe, be considered as distinct species, except the present, which is certainly the most remote of any, if it is really a variety of that species. The Mya ovata, in all its gradations, seems somewhat more ventricose and ovate in its contour, than this Shell; and though the variations of the latter are considerable, we have generally observed a slight depression, across the middle, which causes the narrowest end to be rather flattened throughout, and it is also rather more cunciform or wedge-shaped at this end than Mya ovata: to this we might perhaps add, with some propriety, that the gaping beyond the hinge at the broadest end, is wider than in Mya ovata.</P>
<P>Whether this difference is actually sufficient of form a distinct specific character, and whether it is constant in other shells of this kind, still remains in some degree of uncertainty. Both this and the Mya ovata inhabit the same waters, for we have seen several specimens from the
<PB REF="87">river Froome, where it is known the Mya ovata is also found; and as to colour, it is no criterion: both kinds are greenish, radiated with yellow, and are more or less vivid in different shells: they are seldom higher in colour than the specimen we have figured; some are more of an olive colour, and others are deeply tinged with brown.</P>
