<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Addre&s;s to the SUBSCRIBERS to the ASSO|CIATIONS again&s;t REPUBLICANS and LEVELLERS, prefixed to my <Q>DEFENCE of the LETTER attributed to Mr. REEVES,</Q> the attack of it is treated as ultimately directed again&s;t tho&s;e very numerous and re&s;pectable Bodies, to expo&s;e them to popular indignation: an effect which, if ju&s;tly founded, it could not fail to produce. For if we be obliged to grant the ju&s;tice of the accu&s;ation brought again&s;t him, they appear as connected with a Man, and (as his opponents further a&s;&s;ert) with a Party, &s;y&s;tematically employed to &s;ubvert the Liberties of this Country. Now the &s;pirit of the FIRST ASSOCIATION, and its principles, it will be urged, will pervade all tho&s;e formed in imi|tation of it: and the former mu&s;t be totally deter|mined, or at lea&s;t &s;trongly modified, by the &s;pirit and principles of its founders.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">WHEN OPPOSITION thought it expedient to make u&s;e of the Statutes to which they gave the name of "the GRENVILLE and PITT Acts," to bring the ma&s;s of the People into action upon the &s;tage of Govern|ment, and upon that occa&s;ion declared, by one of their Leaders, that they &s;hould be &s;o brought for|ward; it became nece&s;&s;ary to deprive the A&s;&s;ociated Defenders of the Con&s;titution of the great weight they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the nation, from natural influence and from long-de&s;erved re&s;pect and attachment; for the whole of this weight, they knew, would be fully exerted in oppo&s;ition to their plan. Hence they were led, by a kind of political nece&s;&s;ity, to the ac|cu&s;ation of a Man, connected, by the relation ex|plained above, with each of their di&s;tinct Bodies. And they indicated the con&s;equences they meant to be drawn from it more fully, in a more direct attack upon them, by affirming, that <Q>proofs exi&s;t, that the A&s;&s;ociations (again&s;t Republicans and Levellers) are part of a &s;y&s;tem of a deep-laid con&s;piracy to e&s;tabli&s;h a military de&s;poti&s;m.</Q> Such were the mea&s;ures they embraced in order to de&s;troy the weight of the ASSOCIATIONS, and even to excite the populace again&s;t them.</P>
<P>NOW the latter cannot act unle&s;s they be em|bodied. The declaration that they <HI>&s;hould</HI> act was cotemporary with the accu&s;ations here &s;tated. Some mode is which they were to be embodied was there|fore
<PB REF="4">probably then in contemplation; and it is likely the &s;pecific mode &s;ince recommended by the COM|MITTEE of the WHIG CLUB. But to the &s;ucce&s;s of any &s;uch plan, the accu&s;ation of Mr. REEVES and the ASSOCIATIONS was a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary preparatory mea&s;ure. The object the&s;e attacks would &s;erve could only be pointed out in the DEFENCE, generally; the outlines of the fini&s;hed plan could not be exa|mined before they were given to the Public: they are contained in the following paragraph, taken from the New&s;papers of that time.</P>
<P><Q>THE Committee of the Whig Club appointed to prepare and announce the Form of <HI>A General A&s;&s;ociation of the People,</HI> for the Repeal of the two Statutes be&s;t known by the name of the Gren|ville and Pitt Acts, met at the Shak&s;peare Tavern, the Right Honourable Charles James Fox in the Chair. A Declaration of the Motives of the Club, in recommending this A&s;&s;ociation, was read by Mr. Mackinto&s;h, and unanimou&s;ly approved of. The A&s;&s;ociation, however, goes only to the <HI>&s;ingle point</HI> of the Repeal of tho&s;e Laws, and the Sub&s;cribers pledge them&s;elves <HI>only to pro&s;ecute that &s;ole object</HI> by every <HI>legal and peaceable</HI> means.</Q></P>
<P>IT is the Con&s;titution of the A&s;&s;ociation, not the &s;pecific motives which led the Members to a&s;&s;o|ciate,
<PB REF="5">or the end they hold forth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The object held out by them is, <Q>to re&s;tore the Law of Trea&s;on to the &s;tate in which it &s;tood before the meeting of Parliament la&s;t winter, or on the &s;tatute of 25. Edw. 3. c. 2.</Q> On this no remarks will be made in the body of the Tract, but &s;ome &s;trictures upon it will be found in the APPENDIX, No. 1</P></NOTE>, which will be examined on principles here to be inve&s;tigated; on which it will be &s;hown, that in its form it is highly dangerous, and that it is not &s;anctioned by the pre|cedent of 1792.</P>

<HEAD>AN HISTORICAL ESSAY &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. SOME GENERAL REMARKS ON ASSOCIATIONS IN A STATE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the&s;e Remarks will be con&s;idered, the cau&s;e and end of A&s;&s;ociations, their organization, the compact entered into, and its limits and object.</P>
<P>THE A&s;&s;ociations to be con&s;idered are &s;uch as are in a &s;tricter &s;en&s;e popular; where the individuals a&s;&s;ociate as equals&mdash;not as heads of parties&mdash;or effective rulers of &s;mall di&s;tricts of a kingdom.</P>
<P>IN Society at large, we may ob&s;erve three degrees of union, di&s;tinctly differing in effect and appearance: the middle or average, which is the very health of public &s;pirit; the weaker, which is its corruption, mo&s;tly pre|ceding &s;ome fatal cata&s;trophe; and the &s;tronger, which is its fever: &s;ometimes the &s;truggle of a vigorous habit, to expel whatis deleterious in the con&s;titution; and &s;ome|times terminating fatally.</P>
<P>A SOCIETY, or a part thereof, may be brought into this &s;tronger degree of union by different means. Com|mon principles will effect it, by the force of an increa&s;ed
<PB N="2" REF="7">reciprocal attraction of the individuals who compo&s;e it. The union is greater or le&s;s, as the&s;e are &s;tronger or more remi&s;s. A party may likewi&s;e be conden&s;ed into greater union, by external pre&s;&s;ure. The&s;e two cau&s;es are gene|rally &s;een acting in conjunction.</P>
<P>AT the commencement of &s;uch a union, its object may be defined by a formal contract, either in writing or by parole. Its numbers may be increa&s;ed by the acce&s;&s;ion of others, who thus become virtually parties in the formal contract. Every &s;ociety or party is here &s;aid to be a&s;&s;o|ciated, when a very &s;trong and unu&s;ual degree of union takes place among them, from whichever of the&s;e &s;ources it may have originated, and by whatever contract, tacit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Hence &s;udden in&s;urrections, when the in&s;urgents act together, and have &s;omething like a unity of object, are A&s;&s;ociations. This object may be either ab&s;tracts, as to e&s;tabli&s;h the principles of equa|lity; or &s;pecific, as to reduce the price of wheat.</P></NOTE> or expre&s;s, it may to combined.</P>
<P>THE object of an A&s;&s;ociation is to unite the action of the A&s;&s;ociators in &s;ome mode: that of a <Q>General A&s;|&s;ociation of the People,</Q> or Mr. Fox's A&s;&s;ociation, is to bring a whole people into action, including the popu|lace<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This follows from every definition this Party has given of the term <HI>People.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>A SINGLE a&s;&s;ociation of the people is the mo&s;t per|fect union they can be brought into, but its force will be highly concentrated if it give obedience to a Directory at its head, which "the General A&s;&s;ociation of the People" po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the remainder, or rump, of the Whig Club, who have already a&s;&s;umed, over its future members,
<PB N="3" REF="8">&s;omething &s;uperior to legi&s;lative power, in giving to the A&s;&s;ociation a con&s;titution. If an individual of the Direc|tory &s;way all the re&s;t, for the pre&s;ent he is the effective Dictator of the A&s;&s;ociation. It is ea&s;y to name one who&s;e political character and ability &s;eem to &s;ecure him that a&s;cendancy. The founders of this A&s;&s;ociation profe&s;s to attempt to make it univer&s;al; if they &s;ucceed, they will at fir&s;t concentrate the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible force, under the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible union.</P>
<P>BUT no &s;ingle power in a State &s;hould operate without a counterpoi&s;e (at hand at lea&s;t) to check it. The <Q>General A&s;&s;ociation,</Q> by the very definition of the term, is a power which can have no &s;uch counterpoi&s;e.</P>
<P>IT perhaps might be more accurate to &s;ay, that when any power puts a nation in motion in any direction, ano|ther &s;hould be always ready capable of deflecting its cour&s;e upon occa&s;ion; for it never, in fact, will continue long in a right track, except by the compo&s;ition of mo|tion, from two powers at lea&s;t acting in different direc|tions. Now the whole State mu&s;t obey the impul&s;e of an A&s;&s;ociation really general: it is a &s;hip with every inch of canvas out, without a rudder, moved by the &s;ingle im|pul&s;e of the wind. Again, in all ca&s;es where &s;uch A&s;&s;o|ciations exi&s;t, and have only great influence, the &s;hip will not an&s;wer the helm, or its working will be hindered greatly by it; and the &s;ea, in which &s;he is going at &s;uch times, is always full of rocks and quick&s;ands.</P>
<P>WE have had in the&s;e latter Centuries only one &s;pecies of de&s;poti&s;m to fear, that of Kings; we have now two, that of Kings and Demagogues. The u&s;urpations of the latter are the more &s;anguinary and ferocious. When our
<PB N="4" REF="9">forefathers &s;aw the former mu&s;tering round them power&s; which might hereafter be abu&s;ed, they lo&s;t no time to impo&s;e &s;alutary limits upon them. As much as the ty|ranny of the latter is more dreadful, with &s;o much the more jealou&s;y, its gathering forces together ought to be guarded again&s;t. We are not to &s;hut our eyes upon the one, but we are inten&s;ely to watch the other. Great is the danger of popularity on certain principles to the in|dividual who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it. The man who is become a Dema|gogue, the lowe&s;t fall from wi&s;dom, has often lo&s;t his free|dom of will to ab&s;tain from crimes before he knows it: while he is the apparent conductor of his faction, he is already become their pa&s;&s;ive in&s;trument; and in &s;uch a State the mi&s;ery of tho&s;e who are about to fall the victims of the atrocities called his, may be next to his own; they will not be of that magnitude which entitles them to be rated as &s;econd to it.</P>
<P>THERE are other modes in which a people or a party &s;cattered over the face of a country may a&s;&s;ociate. That embraced by the upper and middle cla&s;&s;es in 1792 is an example of one of them, and the only one there is any pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to con&s;ider. They formed them&s;elves into local A&s;&s;ociations: the obligations they &s;ub&s;cribed varied according to the opinion of every meeting. No &s;ingle form was followed, to con&s;olidate the&s;e numerous and perfectly in&s;ulated bodies into one they all &s;eemed to have a like object; but there was nothing more in their con&s;titutions to give them unity of action, unle&s;s we may &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch union could re&s;ult from the cor|re&s;pondence mo&s;t of them maintained with the commit|tee of the original A&s;&s;ociation, of which Mr. REEVES was the Chairman. The members of that Committee were the acknowledged heads of no party in the State&mdash;in this they
<PB N="5" REF="10">are far le&s;s formidable than the Whig Club; and Mr. REEVES him&s;elf, with no preten&s;ions to the higher or &s;e|condary po&s;ts of Government, and holding not even a &s;eat in the Hou&s;e, to attach the members of the&s;e &s;everal bodies to him, by the dependencies of expectation, certainly has not the dangerous weight of their Leader. This Committee then had no power to draw the other A&s;&s;ocia|tions into an union of any kind, and no &s;tep to this end was taken by them among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THESE independent A&s;&s;ociations, it is &s;aid, exceeded two thou&s;and in number: they had all the union of two thou&s;and individuals, inhabiting a di&s;trict, in the &s;tate of equality; without an elective a&s;&s;embly, a &s;enate of no|bles, or &s;ingle per&s;on to govern them: or of a clu&s;ter of two thou&s;and independent republics, without an a&s;&s;embly of the States at their head, to give them that imperfect unity, of which &s;uch confederacies have, at certain periods, been &s;een for a time to keep up the external appearance.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e A&s;&s;ociations, the principle of union was not at all provided for in their original formation; in that which I &s;hall denominate "the A&s;&s;ociation of Mr. Fox," becau&s;e he is certainly its effective Head, we have &s;een the leading feature to be, the clo&s;e&s;t concentration of force, and <HI>that</HI> of the whole people. In this re&s;pect, therefore, the fir&s;t mea&s;ure is no precedent for the &s;econd.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid in &s;ub&s;tance above, that the object of all A&s;&s;ociations is to combine the &s;ub&s;cribers for imme|diate action, or to be in readine&s;s to act on occa&s;ion. By immediate action I under&s;tand acting in per&s;on, and not mediately or by deputy. Mr. REEVES and Mr. Fox have each addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the people to form A&s;&s;o|ciations.
<PB N="6" REF="11">To compare their &s;everal plans in a &s;econd point of view, let the qualities of the immediate action of the people be now con&s;idered.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II. ON THE ACTION OF THE PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the whole of the people, or a great part of them, are a&s;&s;ociated, it is for &s;ome one purpo&s;e; but let that purpo&s;e be what it may, they will be bad agents therein. There is not a maxim in Monte&s;quieu which has more truth or brilliancy in it than the following: <Q>The people (collectively) have always too much action, or too little. Sometimes with a hundred thou&s;and arms the multitude overthrows every thing; &s;ometimes with a hundred thou&s;and feet it creeps only like an in|&s;ect <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Le peuple a toujours trop d'action, ou trop peu. Quelquefois avec cent mitic bras il renver&s;e tout; quelque&s;ois avec cent mille pieds il <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> va que comme les in&s;ectes. <BIBL><HI>E&s;prit des Loix, Liv. ii. c. 2.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>THIS difference of the effect of the action of the peo|ple mu&s;t ari&s;e from the difference of the &s;pirit by which they are actuated at &s;uch times; and this, again, mu&s;t depend much upon the object which excited it. Now the object of the&s;e A&s;&s;ociations is either the continuance of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the members, or the acqui&s;ition of a better by their united force: and from this con&s;ideration we derive another divi&s;ion of A&s;&s;ociations into Defen&s;ive and Offen&s;ive, and both conjointly.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12">HENCE, as all A&s;&s;ociations to gain what the members do not po&s;&s;e&s;s are Offen&s;ive, an A&s;&s;ociation to regain what they cea&s;e to po&s;&s;e&s;s is Offen&s;ive al&s;o. Its &s;pirit, at lea&s;t will be equal in &s;trength to that with which an acqui&s;i|tion of an object never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before, is pur&s;ued, and po&s;&s;ibly more, as &s;ome degree of re&s;entment may warm it. If the a&s;&s;ociators have been deprived of it by law, they contend for an illegal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or a legal right they po&s;|&s;e&s;s not.</P>
<P>LET us now compare the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es of A&s;&s;ociations as to their effects, from the known qualities of human nature; and afterwards, from what Hi&s;tory has given us upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE fear of lo&s;ing what we already enjoy occupies the mind but very little. Hence A&s;&s;ociations of parties formed upon a Defen&s;ive principle, are very different in the &s;pirit which pervades them, and in their effects, from tho&s;e formed on principles of acqui&s;ition, or Offen&s;ive A&s;&s;ocia|tions. The efforts men exert to continue as they are, par|take greatly of the moderation of that frame of mind which gives birth to them&mdash;content in their pre&s;ent &s;tate: a &s;entiment which has not habitually all that force on our minds which it ought to have. On the other hand, there is no emotion which we indulge our&s;elves in with &s;o little re&s;traint, as the hope of a change of our &s;tate for the better; and the con&s;tancy of that indul|gence is &s;uch, that men habituate them&s;elves to it; until that pa&s;&s;ion has, in mo&s;t minds, acquired a very di&s;tem|pered magnitude and force. This is the rea&s;on that when men form combinations in Civil Society to defend the good they enjoy, there is too much inertne&s;s in all their movements: but if the object of their formal union is
<PB N="8" REF="13">&s;omething they wi&s;h to acquire, they are heated to a fervor which carries them far beyond the bounds of &s;obriety and expedience; and when a State is divided into two parties, the majority acting upon the fir&s;t, and the minority upon the &s;econd principle, the latter has been too frequently able to overpower the former, with the better cau&s;e, and the apparent weight of influence on its &s;ide. Hence Mr. Hume, con&s;idering the colli&s;ion of two &s;uch parties, &s;ays with great truth, <Q>One furious enthu&s;ia&s;t is able, by his active indu&s;try, to &s;urmount the indolent efforts of many &s;ober and rea&s;onable antagoni&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. v. 6. p. 302.</NOTE></Q>.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, the&s;e two kinds of Popular A&s;&s;ociations, the Defen&s;ive and Offen&s;ive, fall under the two ca&s;es de|&s;cribed by Monte&s;quieu: in the fir&s;t of which, the action of the people has too little energy; and in the la&s;t, over|whelms every thing in ruin. The original A&s;&s;ociation of Mr. REEVES, and all tho&s;e afterwards formed upon the &s;ame plan, were Defen&s;ive, being to guard the Con&s;titu|tion again&s;t Republicans and Levellers; Mr. Fox's A&s;&s;o|ciation is Offen&s;ive, being again&s;t exi&s;ting laws formed for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>If a law be right <HI>per &s;e,</HI> an A&s;&s;ociation to procure the repeal of it, is termed, with equal ju&s;tice, Offen&s;ive, whether it has been pa&s;&s;ed three days or three centuries; and every law is to be &s;o held, until the contrary is demon&s;trated. At the end of this Tract it will be &s;hewn, that the old Law of Trea&s;on contains a gro&s;s offence again&s;t the fir&s;t principles of legi&s;lation.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I SHALL now con&s;ider more particularly the nature of the&s;e two &s;pecies of A&s;&s;ociations, chiefly deducing my conclu&s;ions from Hi&s;tory, beginning with that which is here termed Defen&s;ive.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. ON THE SPIRIT OF DEFENSIVE ASSOCIATIONS OF THE PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;pirit by which we may, in future, expect to &s;ee defen&s;ive A&s;&s;ociations actuated, will be clearly &s;een in the conduct of tho&s;e which have preceded them. The object of &s;uch an A&s;&s;ociation may be the defence of the authority of one or more of the con&s;tituent parts of the Legi&s;lature, of particular laws, or of the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THE Royali&s;ts who followed the fortunes of Charles the Fir&s;t, formed an A&s;&s;ociation in defence of the Crown. The formal nature of this compact I &s;hall pre&s;ently come to the expo&s;ition of. Before the adjournment of the Hou&s;es in September 1641, many excellent con&s;titutional and municipal laws had been pa&s;&s;ed: and if Parliament had &s;uffered &s;ome violences to take place, there &s;eemed no danger of their being drawn into precedent. To pa&s;s over the two outrages which took place immediately after that a&s;&s;embly met again, the one on the part of the Com|mons, the other on the part of the Crown; the fir&s;t of which &s;eemed calculated principally to draw after it &s;ome|thing of the nature of the &s;econd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, No. III.</NOTE>; I go to the further part of the conduct of that a&s;&s;embly. They attempted to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of a great part of the executive power, by originating commi&s;&s;ions by bill, for the highe&s;t offi|cers
<PB N="10" REF="15">civil and military, the Lords Lieutenants and Depu|ties; they refu&s;ed to define the extent of their demands for the &s;ettlement of the nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, v. 6. p. 416.</NOTE>; and they &s;eized the King's magazines into their own hands. The catalogue of their attempts of this kind might be enlarged.</P>
<P>THE King was at la&s;t &s;upported, not only by a vir|tual, but what is entitled to be called a formal A&s;&s;ocia|tion; according to the definition of &s;uch a compact gi|ven above. It was purely in its nature Defen&s;ive; its ob|ject was to maintain the Con&s;titution and exi&s;ting laws, including tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ed in the Parliament then &s;itting. The articles of that of the Peers, who fir&s;t joined him at York, were in writing. The King made a Declaration, <Q>That he expected from them no obedience to any com|mands which were not warranted by the laws of the land.</Q> They <Q>an&s;wered this Declaration by a Prote&s;t, in which they declared their re&s;olution to obey no commands not &s;o warranted. Deliberate engagements,</Q> (&s;ays the Hi&s;torian) <Q>worthy of an Engli&s;h Prince, and an Engli&s;h nobility<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hume, v. 6. p. 426.</NOTE>.</Q> Again, when the King was on his march to Shrew&s;bury, in a &s;olemn Prote&s;tation at the head of his army, he recognized the conditions on which he was to receive "aid and relief" from his &s;ubjects in general. We have here his own te&s;timony to the terms of the A&s;|&s;ociation, the pre&s;ervation of the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws; a|mong which, tho&s;e of the exi&s;ting Parliament were then fir&s;t expre&s;sly named<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 439.</NOTE>. This compact, not reduced into writing by the parties like the fir&s;t, was a defen&s;ive A&s;&s;o|ciation of the People on terms recited to them; very

<P>THESE tran&s;actions are too &s;olemn for us to &s;uppo&s;e, without &s;omething of proof, that they were intended for the purpo&s;es of mere deception. It mu&s;t be admitted, in|deed, that the Declarations of the Heads of Parties &s;ome|times hold forth only &s;pecious preten&s;ions to gather &s;trength, not their ultimate objects. While they &s;eem to re&s;t only on the fir&s;t, their agents, by their intrigues and writings, are preparing the way for the &s;econd; but when the primary and &s;econdary parti&s;ans of a cau&s;e both de|cidedly look one way, we may pre&s;ume with confidence that the o&s;ten&s;ible and real views of the party are the &s;ame. "During the war," &s;ays Coke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke's Detection.</NOTE>, <Q>it is ob&s;ervable, that the writers for the King chiefly maintained his cau&s;e out of Sir Edward Coke's Pleas of the Crown.</Q> But this appeal to his authority goes &s;omewhat farther; it amounts to a full, though tacit dereliction of the princi|ples held at Court about &s;even years before the commence|ment of the war; when Sir Edward Coke's MS. of the Pleas of the Crown, his Comment upon Magna Charta, and on the Juri&s;diction of Courts, had been &s;eized by order of the Privy Council, as dangerous and &s;editious. They had been lately printed by order of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the originals re&s;tored to Sir Edward's heir, on their petition to the King.</P>
<P>THE Parliament at that time, without doubt, declar|ed with equal warmth for the Laws and the Con&s;titution, in general terms; but their literary advocates looked ano|ther
<PB N="12" REF="17">way. It &s;uited neither the mea&s;ures nor the ultimate object of their principals, to fix the attention of the na|tion upon the&s;e repo&s;itories of con&s;titutional knowledge "I do not find," &s;ays Coke, <Q>any who wrote for the Parliament <HI>ever u&s;ed any one topic</HI> out of the Pleas of the Crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke, v. 1. p. 135.</NOTE>, although that a&s;&s;embly had ordered them to be printed:</Q> They probably repented of this order.</P>
<P>HENCE it appears, that the principles the Royali&s;ts &s;et out upon, and continued to hold, were tho&s;e of a de|fen&s;ive A&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>IT is a question which comes in here, not directly in|deed, but collaterally, Had the popular part of the Con|&s;titution obtained a due degree of &s;trength when this A&s;|&s;ociation to maintain it in its exi&s;ting &s;tate took place? I have lately held the affirmative &s;ide of this question, but the examination of it is of &s;uch a length, that it is given in an article of the Appendix<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">No. IV.</NOTE>. It may however be e&s;tabli&s;hed very briefly <HI>&agrave; fortiori,</HI> upon the authority of Black&s;tone, in his Hi&s;tory of the Progre&s;s and <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Laws of England, with which he concludes his Commentaries. Speaking of this period, <Q>The King had now,</Q> &s;ays this learned Expo&s;itor, <Q>con&s;ented to reduce the prerogative to a lower ebb than was con|&s;i&s;tent with monarchical government<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. 4. p. 437. 5th edition.</NOTE>.</Q> It is a fact, that the Bill of Rights left to the Crown more legal prerogatives than Charles then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &Verbar;, or the Royali&s;ts fought to continue to him; and that he would have been very glad, after he had been peaceably readmit|ted to reign upon the terms of his Prote&s;tation, to have
<PB N="13" REF="18">exchanged the whole ma&s;s of the prerogatives, which would have been &s;o left him, to be a limited King on the footing of that in&s;trument: and the place of all tho&s;e Whigs, who, at the Revolution, thought the liberties of the kingdom &s;ufficiently defined and provided for, would, in Charles's time, have been in the royal camp.</P>
<P>IT is remarked in the la&s;t Section, that a Defen&s;ive A&s;|&s;ociation does not act up to the whole &s;pirit of its princi|ples. It might be expected, if this general ob&s;ervation were frequently fal&s;e, it would be found &s;o here. The &s;everities the Parliament exerci&s;ed, in their own quarters, again&s;t the Royali&s;ts, under the name of Malignants and Delinquents, mu&s;t have thoroughly taught tho&s;e about the King what <HI>they</HI> were to expect, who had actually borne arms again&s;t the Parliamentarians, if they were finally conquerors. Be&s;ide, the engagements of the King, and the power they held in their own hands to enforce them, might have &s;eemed to them a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity to the Con&s;titution, if that Party were vanqui&s;hed; but they were determined not to &s;uffer him to make peace as a con|queror. Coke lived and acted in tho&s;e unhappy times: his father was a member of the Long Parliament, <Q>and one of the fir&s;t rate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke, v. 2. p. 52. 1694.</NOTE>.</Q> He tells us, <Q>I have often heard &s;everal of tho&s;e who followed the King in the war, &s;ay, they as much dreaded the King's overcoming the Parliament, as they feared to be overcome by them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Coke, v. 1. p. 135.</NOTE>.</Q> This is confirmed in &s;ome extracts of James's Papers, which I &s;aw about &s;ix years ago. The Parliamentarians he &s;tates to have been in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, that the King was able to have put an end to the
<PB N="14" REF="19">war at once, the metropolis lying at his mercy for &s;ome time: the leading men about him put a negative upon his march to London. The &s;uperiority of the Royali&s;ts over the Parliamentarians, until the junction of the latter with the Scotch, was inconte&s;tible. They acted with the humanity of an able &s;word&s;man, who, feeling his advantage over his antagoni&s;t, whom he is de&s;irous to &s;pare, waits to di&s;arm him, till he receives a mortal thru&s;t him&s;elf. We &s;ee here, that A&s;&s;ociations in defence of the con&s;titutional power of the Sovereign are not in their &s;pirit inimical to the Con&s;titution; and even that when great danger urges them to &s;ecure the full object for which they come forward, and it is placed completely in their power, they will not at up to the full &s;pirit of their original compact.</P>
<P>BUT it may be &s;aid, that after &s;uch a Party is exa&s;perated by re&s;i&s;tance, and the &s;ufferings they mu&s;t have undergone in the previous &s;truggle, they may be inflamed by victories to forget the moderation which re&s;trained them in their doubtful fortunes, and pu&s;h their vindictive triumphs to extremes. They will go further than the limits pre|&s;cribed in their defen&s;ive compacts, when every thing is in their power. Before we had &s;een what the extreme of calamity is, in the cruelties inflicted upon the French no|bility and gentry, we &s;hould have affirmed, that the Royali&s;ts of England had been irritated as much as the utmo&s;t &s;everity of per&s;ecution could effect in a chri&s;tian country and in an enlightened age. It may be &s;till &s;aid their oppre&s;&s;ions and &s;ufferings were great, and they felt their with all the violence of indignation. <Q>No &s;ocial intercour&s;e was then maintained between the two par|ties, no marriages or alliances contracted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, v. 7. p. 340.</NOTE>.</Q> When

Car. tit.</NOTE>,</Q> was the object of dread to the latter. Yet, in the fir&s;t moment of their return to power, they pub|li&s;hed Declarations in all the counties of England, which completely bound up their hands from vindictive mea|&s;ures: engagements which they fulfilled with fidelity equal to the conciliatory prudence with which they formed them<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>The Pre&s;byterians were &s;carce wet with the tail of this &s;torm, none of them (except tho&s;e in &s;eque&s;tered livings), being puni&s;hed either in their per&s;ons or fortunes. <BIBL><HI>Coke's Det.</HI> v. 2. p. 101.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. I copy the conclu&s;ion of one of them, that of the nobility and gentry in and about the City of London. <Q>It is our hope and prayer, that when the building come to be rai&s;ed, it may not, like Rome, have the begin|ning in the blood of brethren, nor like Babel, be inter|rupted by confu&s;ion of tongues: but that we may all &s;peak one language and be of one name; that all mention of parties and factions, and all rancour and animo|&s;ities, may be thrown in and buried like rubbi&s;h under the foundation.</Q> This Declaration was &s;igned by twenty peers, and fifty knights and e&s;quires.</P>
<P>THE Royali&s;ts in the Convention Parliament of Charles the Second have been cen&s;ured for re&s;toring him without
<PB N="16" REF="21">conditions; and the mi&s;conduct of his reign, and the &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes of his family, have been attributed to this mi&s;placed loyalty. Nothing can be le&s;s grounded than this cen&s;ure: the Royal prerogative, before the breaking out of the Civil Wars, had been reduced <Q>to a lower ebb than was con&s;i&s;tent with Monarchical Government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black. Com. v. 4. p. 437.</NOTE>,</Q> and any new limitations upon the So|vereign would have been founding a &s;econd Republic in the very act of de&s;troying the fir&s;t. The cen&s;ure implies like|wi&s;e that the authors of the Bill of Rights, in the preroga|tives they left to the Crown, laid the foundations of a future tyranny.</P>
<P>AFTER the Re&s;toration, the Royali&s;ts were &s;till united in one compact body. In the &s;econd Parliament, their ma|jority over their opponents was deci&s;ive; and be&s;ide, the whole tide of popular enthu&s;ia&s;m was by this time turned in favour of their principles. Now, to argue in the &s;pi|rit of that jealou&s;y with which a certain Party, now, ver|bally pretends to con&s;ider the multitude of in&s;ulated A&s;|&s;ociations of the gentry, and the greater part of the middle cla&s;s of the people, in defence of the Con&s;titution, and the con&s;titutional power of the Sovereign, <Q>from &s;uch a Parliament, who&s;e principles were &s;upported by the zeal and ardour of a whole people, we might expect all the bad mea&s;ures which could &s;pring from the con|fidence of &s;trength and the in&s;olence of victory; goaded on by the recent memory of the &s;terne&s;t and &s;evere&s;t oppre&s;&s;ions, the effects of which, from the heavy mort|gages by which compo&s;itions, &s;eque&s;trations, and dila|pidations, had involved their e&s;tates<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Coke, v. 2. p. 101.</NOTE>, they mu&s;t &s;till have continued to feel.

<P>THE &s;y&s;tem of Government, before the &s;itting of the Long Parliament, &s;tood in the greate&s;t need of a reform: the nation felt &s;omething beyond the violation of &s;ophi&s;|tical parities begetting ideal grievances: it laboured under great practical oppre&s;&s;ions, and ju&s;tly dreaded they would be perpetuated and increa&s;ed. The pa&s;t conduct of the King could not find a reputable defender in the Com|mons when they fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled: this a&s;&s;embly contained many excellent men, intent on real reformation, who were &s;oon able to effect whatever they had intended. On his return from Scotland, the King had at lea&s;t an equa|lity in the Lower Hou&s;e; the be&s;t men were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;top at the point they had attained: the other party, backed by the populace of London, rendered it impo&s;&s;i|ble.

<P>I AM approached &s;o near to the Abdication of James, that I &s;hall continue the hi&s;tory of the tran&s;actions of this Party to that great epoch. There we &s;hall find &s;ome deviations from the rectitude of their former conduct, and a &s;plendid return to it; exhibiting a balance much in their favour After the fiction of the Popi&s;h Plot had obtained too exten&s;ive belief, the danger of a civil war appeared as threatening at lea&s;t as in the year 1640. Coke, who &s;aw the ferment of the nation in both pe|riods, affirms, that at that time <Q>the nation was more fiercely rent in divi&s;ions, under the names of Whig and Tory, than it was before the wars<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Coke's Detection, v. 1. Apology to Reader, la&s;t page.</NOTE>.</Q> In 1680 the Popular and Republican Party had recour&s;e to the &s;ame means of inflaming the Nation which had been practi&s;ed with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s in 1640&mdash;tumultuous Pe|titioning. The end this leads to is always the &s;ame, be its object what it will; namely, the con&s;traint of &s;ome power which the Con&s;titution leaves free. It was now employed to obtain an immediate &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parlia|ment. The Royali&s;ts endeavoured to counteract the effect of this mea&s;ure, by Addre&s;&s;es to the Throne, declaring their <Q>abhorrence of tho&s;e, who endeavoured to en|croach upon the prerogative, by pre&s;cribing to the King any time for a&s;&s;embling the Parliament.</Q> Tumul|tuous Petitioning is at all times a tacit menace, and meant to be &s;o under&s;tood. At this juncture it was be|lieved to be the &s;ignal of civil war. Yet the abhorrers, influenced by their recollection of the pa&s;t and their
<PB N="19" REF="24">fear for the future, certainly expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in words not favorable to the right of orderly Petitioning, though they cannot be directly applied again&s;t it. It may very well be al&s;o affirmed, that the mo&s;t zealous friends of the popular branch of the Legi&s;lature ought at that in&s;tant to have been the mo&s;t determined oppo&s;ers of the Peti|tioners. For the King, without doubt, had at that time fallen upon the plan which, with an addre&s;s fatal to his family, he was afterward able to carry into execution;&mdash; that of di&s;gu&s;ting the nation with the violence of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive Parliaments, that he might at la&s;t rule without them. After the di&s;&s;olution of his &s;econd Parliament, it was his con&s;tant practice to i&s;&s;ue writs for a new Hou&s;e of Commons, at a &s;ea&s;on when the mo&s;t intemperate of his opponents had the be&s;t chance to obtain &s;eats in the Lower Hou&s;e. With the &s;ame policy, when it was a&s;&s;embled, he &s;o adju&s;ted his conce&s;&s;ions to their violent Motions, that the friends of the Laws and Con&s;titution of the kingdom thought them to be &s;o great as to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the internal balance of their &s;y&s;tem; yet they were &s;o limited that he perfectly knew before|hand they would be rejected contemptuou&s;ly by Oppo|&s;ition. Be&s;ides, this apparent facility in making conce&s;|&s;ions they never could have expected, elevated them with the &s;tronge&s;t expectations of a final victory over him; and led them on from extravagance to extravagance, until the Nation, warm in the prai&s;es of his conciliating moderation, became united again&s;t them, and was not &s;olicitous to &s;ee &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies meeting again very &s;oon. He hardly made a &s;ecret of this policy, previous to the meeting of his la&s;t Parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Macph. Hi&s;t. v. 1. p. 351.</NOTE>. The tumultuous Peti|tions
<PB N="20" REF="25">of the times increa&s;ed the violence of the Commons by the a&s;&s;urance of popular &s;upport; thus a&s;&s;i&s;ting the lures and irritations of the Court to hurry them into the &s;nare. They ought to have been oppo&s;ed with the mo&s;t determinate mea&s;ures: but the zeal of the Addre&s;|&s;ers pointed out to the King, with what rapidity the credit of Parliaments began to fall.</P>
<P>IT is thus we &s;ee, that in the middle of the ferment about the Popi&s;h Plot, in 1679, he di&s;&s;olved one Parlia|ment, and i&s;&s;ued writs for the election of another next day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Macph. Hi&s;t. v. 1. p. 290.</NOTE>. This could &s;erve only to irritate his opponents; &s;ure, in the pre&s;ent temper of the lower voters, of their re-election, and even to increa&s;e their number. And, that he might farther aggravate the factious violence of the new Hou&s;e of Commons, by repeated proclamations he hindered their a&s;&s;embling for more than a year after the time originally appointed. This gave birth to the Petitions for a &s;e&s;&s;ion mentioned above. That his con|ce&s;&s;ions were con&s;tructed with the art I have de&s;cribed, in order to di&s;credit Parliament with the &s;ober part of the people, will appear from the following account from Hume, where we &s;hall &s;ee him making a previous expe|riment, upon a large &s;cale, of their aptitude for this very purpo&s;e, before he brings them actually forwards into practice. Temple and Shafte&s;bury were of the Privy Council in 1679, when Charles propo&s;ed to the Board a &s;cheme of limitations on a Popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or, to defeat the Exclu&s;ion Bill. From what Temple &s;aid on them, he was confirmed in his judgment of the &s;entiments the true &s;upporters of the National Con&s;titution would form
<PB N="21" REF="26">of this &s;acrifice. It was the opinion of that great State&s;|man, <Q>that the re&s;traints were &s;o rigorous as even to &s;ubvert the Con&s;titution; and that &s;hackles put upon a Popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or would not afterwards be ea&s;ily ca&s;t off by a Prote&s;tant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, v. 7. p. 102.</NOTE>.</Q> By this authority Charles was confirmed in his expectation, that, when three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Parliaments &s;hould have rejected &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions, and the fear of a civil war was hanging over their heads, he &s;hould have led the &s;entiments of a mi&s;guided and, at length, confiding people to the point to which he wi&s;hed to bring them. By the oppo&s;ite declarations of Shafte&s;|bury he was likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured what powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance he &s;hould receive from <HI>his</HI> faction toward the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;cheme, when the Pre&s;ident of his Privy Council told him at the Board, "that the re&s;traints" (which Temple thought exce&s;&s;ive) <Q>were in&s;ufficient; and that nothing but the total exclu&s;ion of the Duke could give a proper  &s;ecurity to the kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</Q> In this he fore&s;aw the contemptuous rejection of his propo&s;itions, and his ulti|mate mi&s;erable triumph. If I under&s;tand what Mr. She|ridan is &s;tated to have &s;aid, he thinks he has di&s;covered &s;ome &s;imilitude between the A&s;&s;ociators for the defence of the National Con&s;titution in 1792, and the Royali&s;ts at the period here treated of. To di&s;criminate exactly how much of truth and how much of error may enter into that conception, would draw me too far; but of two points I am confident: No &s;y&s;tem &s;o in&s;idious will be now u&s;ed to lead us into ruin; and that, enlightened as we are by the example of the pa&s;t, if &s;uch an attempt were made, it would not be &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27">THERE is al&s;o a farther charge which may be brought again&s;t the party of the Royali&s;ts in Charles the Second's time Shafte&s;bury, to forward his attack upon the Royal power, forged the Popi&s;h Plot. Thus he took away the lives of many innocent men with, and &s;ome almo&s;t with|out, the forms of law. The Royali&s;ts, in the latter end of Charles the Second's reign, abu&s;ed a &s;eeming victory for a &s;hort time; giving countenance to &s;omething too much like an imitation of tho&s;e &s;hameful ho&s;tilities com|menced by their adver&s;aries, but not on &s;o terrible a &s;cale. But when a general danger, augmented perhaps &s;omewhat by their former intemperance, threatened the liberties of the kingdom, they &s;tood forth the foremo&s;t in their defence: the great majority of the Di&s;&s;enters and Exclu&s;ioni&s;ts had inli&s;ted as the &s;atellites of Ty|ranny.</P>
<P>THE fear of a &s;econd Civil War, when they had hardly emerged, half ruined, a very few years before, from the fir&s;t; the terrors of legal a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination &s;u&s;pended over their heads; and the profound art of Charles the Second, led this defen&s;ive party, at the beginning of this latter period, into &s;ome bad mea&s;ures; and though we may &s;ay of tho&s;e of their opponents, which cau&s;ed them, that they were much wor&s;e, they detract &s;omewhat from their political merit, in being the chief in&s;truments in placing William on the Throne, and maintaining him there, but not the greater part of it.</P>
<P>I BUILD nothing upon a few extravagant declarations of either Party. Both of them are to be judged by their practical principles; that is, tho&s;e which they di&s;play in action, or which are di&s;played in the actions of men
<PB N="23" REF="28">whom they hold out as examples. The characters of Parties are al&s;o to be e&s;timated like tho&s;e of individuals&mdash; from the general tenor of their actions; not from acci|dental errors, which are an exception to it: and &s;o e&s;ti|mating the Defen&s;ive A&s;&s;ociation to pre&s;erve the limited Royal power, from the Civil Wars to the Revolution, we have &s;een that it was friendly to the limitations of the Monarchy, as well as to the Monarchy it&s;elf; and twice, in fact, pre&s;erved them at its own proper hazard.</P>
<P>I CONCLUDE my remarks on the intere&s;ting hi&s;tory of their conduct with the following ob&s;ervation:&mdash;If this A&s;&s;ociation had been able, not only to pre&s;erve the legal power of the King when it was attacked, but even to extend it afterwards, and had &s;o done, it by no means follows, that if it had been divided into any great num|ber of &s;ections, as, for in&s;tance, two thou&s;and, acting independently of each other, without a Council or &s;ingle per&s;on at their head, that it would have been able to effect both the&s;e purpo&s;es; or even the fir&s;t, again&s;t a con|centrated Oppo&s;ition of any degree of power. It appears therefore, that a Republic of &s;mall Defen&s;ive A&s;&s;ociations, &s;uch as that which &s;tarted up in 1792, is by no means dangerous. But a people &s;o a&s;&s;ociated is much &s;ooner formed into order to oppo&s;e any violence upon their Laws and Con&s;titutions, than if the danger comes upon them when totally unprepared.</P>

<P>FOR the &s;upport of the Offen&s;ive A&s;&s;ociation now &s;et on foot, examples of others, Defen&s;ive in their nature, and who&s;e tran&s;actions are intitled to the veneration of all &s;ucceeding ages, will certainly at this time be pro|duced, and &s;aid to be of the former kind. Of the&s;e there are three eminent in&s;tances in our Hi&s;tory: The A&s;&s;ociation of the Barons at Merton; that in the time of John; and the Coalition of the Whigs and Tories in 1688, to invite the Prince of Orange into the kingdom.

<P>THE A&s;&s;ociation of the Barons again&s;t John was likewi&s;e Defen&s;ive. At his coronation he had &s;worn
<PB N="25" REF="30">to maintain the Laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, the particulars of which were fallen almo&s;t into oblivion. A Charter of Henry the Fir&s;t recited and confirmed them. Of the contents of this little was known, until a copy of it fell into the hands of Stephen Langton, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Favored by opportunity, he determined to make u&s;e of this fortunate di&s;covery. In this he pro|ceeded &s;tep by &s;tep, with great addre&s;s. One condition impo&s;ed by the Archbi&s;hop, before he gave John an ab&s;olution from his excommunication, was, his renew|ing his oath to the Saxon Laws; he afterward induced him to confirm the Charter of Henry the Fir&s;t. At the breaking up of the following Parliament in London, the Archbi&s;hop called a private meeting of &s;ome of the chief of the Barons. They were ea&s;ily induced to promi&s;e to take the fir&s;t convenient opportunity to have this Charter validly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and they retained it in their own hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The oath to the Saxon Laws was treated by the fir&s;t Norman Princes as a form only. The contents of the Charter of Henry the Fir&s;t were even unknown when the Archbi&s;hop produced it to the Barons. <Q>There is now likewi&s;e di&s;covered (&s;ays he) a certain Charter of Henry the Fir&s;t;</Q> and John&s;on ob&s;erves, that <Q>he put the Barons in the right way to claim their e&s;tates with their writings in their hands.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Vindication of</HI> M. CH.</P></NOTE> John now departed on an un&s;ucce&s;sful expe|dition to his foreign dominions. A little time pre|vious to his return, the confederacy having &s;pread wider, and comprehending almo&s;t all the Barons of England, a meeting was &s;ummoned by the Archbi&s;hop at St. Ed|mund&s;bury, under pretence of devotion. It was there agreed, that they &s;hould prefer their petition for the ac|tual ob&s;ervance of the Charter in a body; and in the mean time take arms to enforce their demands. The&s;e
<PB N="26" REF="31">particulars being &s;ettled, going up to the high altar in the church there, they &s;wore in their order to ad|here to each other, and not to lay down their arms until they had obtained their demands; which, after &s;ome in|effectual re&s;i&s;tance, John was obliged to grant at Runny|mede. This A&s;&s;ociation, &s;anctified by the forms of reli|gion, was &s;trictly Defen&s;ive. The Charter had before been admitted by John to be the Law of the Land, and even &s;ome articles of that in&s;trument, which would have increa&s;ed the value of their baronies, but greatly affected the Crown revenues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The different manner in which this Charter affected the powers exerci&s;ed by the Crown, and its legal rights, is very &s;ingu|lar. The fir&s;t were greatly re&s;trained, many u&s;urpations being cut off, but its legal rights were extended by it: &s;ome lucrative feudal incidents aboli&s;hed by the former Charters, were re&s;tored by this.</P></NOTE>, the Barons had the moderation to give up, when John could not have &s;ucceeded in maintaining them. But the faithle&s;s character of that Prince induced them to demand the nomination of twenty-five members of their own body, as con&s;ervators of the articles of the amended Charter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hume's Hi&s;tory and Vindication of Magna Charta. John&s;on's Works, fol. 1713.</NOTE>. We find here, and during the whole of the following reign, when the Hou&s;e of Com|mons fir&s;t became a con&s;tituent part of the Legi&s;lature, the Engli&s;h Clergy taking part with the majority of the Barons again&s;t the Pope and the King, who always acted in conjunction.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be admitted, that this and the former A&s;&s;oci|ation were purely Defen&s;ive. They al&s;o re&s;embled in nothing a Popular A&s;&s;ociation: they are no more intitled
<PB N="27" REF="32">to be called &s;o, than a league of the numerous Princes, Dukes, and Counts of Germany again&s;t the Emperor, or the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Electors would be; or the oppo&s;ition of an hereditary Senate of Nobles again&s;t a Prince or the Prelates of a State.</P>
<P>AT the Revolution there were two A&s;&s;ociations; for we may call the invitation of the Prince of Orange an act proving an antecedent compact of that kind; and after his landing, there was an in&s;trument bearing that name, drawn up by Burnet, on the requi&s;ition of Sir Edward Seymour. He is the be&s;t reporter of the object of his own paper. It contained, in few words, <Q>an engagement of the &s;ub&s;cribers to &s;tick together, in pur&s;uing the ends of the Prince's Declaration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Hi&s;t. 12mo. 1725. v. 3. p. 1332.</NOTE>,</Q> and in defence of his per&s;on. That Declaration was confined to pa&s;t violations of law, and a requi&s;ition of redre&s;s by Parliament. <Q>And the Prince thereby a&s;&s;ured the world, that his expedition was intended for no other de&s;ign but to procure a free Parliament, to heal the breaches between the King and his &s;ubjects<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Macpher&s;on's Hi&s;t. v. 1. p. 522.</NOTE>.</Q> Nothing is to be di&s;cerned here but mea&s;ures of defence and concili|ation. <Q>It was &s;igned by all who were with the Prince, even by many who refu&s;ed afterwards to take the oaths to the Prince when &s;eated on the Throne<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dalrym. Memoirs, part 1. p. 161.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>THE Abdication of James annihilated the greater part of the conditions of the A&s;&s;ociation, by rendering the execution of them impo&s;&s;ible; but while it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, no act
<PB N="28" REF="33">took place which went beyond its primary object; and when the members found them&s;elves in circum&s;tances ab&s;olutely unprovided for, becau&s;e they could not have po&s;&s;ibly been fore&s;een, they acted on the defen&s;ive &s;pirit of that engagement which &s;urvived the letter. At the Revolution <Q>no one part of the Con&s;titution was altered or &s;uffered the lea&s;t damage; but, on the con|trary, the whole received new life and vigour.</Q> This was the doctrine held by Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyl at the Trial of Dr. Sacheverel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, No. VI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS compact likewi&s;e was very different from a Gene|ral A&s;&s;ociation of the People: it was an A&s;&s;ociation of Heads of Parties, or rather of per&s;ons holding a power over their followers; &s;omewhat between Heads of Parties and Feudal Chiefs. For, in the confu&s;ion of the Civil Wars, the tenants and dependants of the greater landed Gentry had been accu&s;tomed again to follow them as their mili|tary leaders. The habits and ideas of the military &s;ubordi|nation of a tenant to his chieftain, thus revived, were not worn out again. Much of it was &s;uperadded to the in|fluence of landlord over tenant, as we now &s;ee it exi&s;t. This yeomanry therefore did not, by the act of follow|ing their landlords, accede to the A&s;&s;ociation as equal parties therein, or as inve&s;ted with an equal power of deliberation and re&s;olution in claims or mea&s;ures. That great majority of People, <HI>the Populace,</HI> did indeed, while the event of the Revolution remained in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, de|clare their wills twice; or at lea&s;t the only part of the lower orders of the kingdom who were enabled by cir|cum&s;tances to declare it; that is, the populace of Lon|don.
<PB N="29" REF="34">When James, after the failure of his attempt to go over to France, returned thither, <Q>never Prince re|turning after victory to his capital, was received with louder acclamations of joy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Macpher&s;on and Hume.</NOTE></Q> by the "populace." On the 16th of December they rejoiced at the appearance of his re&s;umption of the Royal power; and on the 4th of the following February they expre&s;&s;ed their &s;econd will upon the &s;ubject; tumultuou&s;ly a&s;&s;embling in crowds at the doors of the Hou&s;es of Parliament, loading with imprecations tho&s;e who adhered to their will of the 16th of December, and its opponents with ble&s;&s;ings. The Prince of Orange i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation to &s;top the&s;e di&s;orderly proceedings, although in his favour<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>When Charles the Fir&s;t returned from Scotland, November 25. 1641, <Q>he was received in London with the &s;houts and acclama|tions of the people, and every demon&s;tration of regard and affec|tion.</Q> Hume, v. 6.

The will of the &s;overeign populace &s;eems as ill-informed and capricious as that of any other precipitate and ignorant de&s;pot; and that will is the will of the &s;overeign people, whenever it is really and truly taken; as they con&s;titute more than nine twelfths, that is, three fourths of Society.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE manner in which the attack upon our Con&s;titu|tion of Government will be on this occa&s;ion made, in writing or &s;peaking, is &s;o evident, that it is not difficult to guard again&s;t it. It may be very well fore&s;een, that every A&s;&s;ociation recorded in our Hi&s;tory, which has been followed by a happy event, will be cited as a precedent in defence of Mr. Fox's. To prevent &s;uch irrelevant in&s;tances being brought into
<PB N="30" REF="35">the argument, it has been &s;hown that none of the&s;e have been General A&s;&s;ociations of the People, or to which the populace were a party; and that none of them have been A&s;&s;ociations of acqui&s;ition, or Offen&s;ive.</P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION V. ON THE SPIRIT OF OFFENSIVE ASSOCIATIONS OF THE PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ON PRETENCES OF RELIGION.</P>
<P>I REPEAT what has been laid down in a former Section: Tho&s;e A&s;&s;ociations are here termed Offen&s;ive, the objects of which are, &s;ome change of the exi&s;ting Laws; whether relating to the governors or the govern|ed:&mdash;and Popular, in which the populace become, or are invited to become, contracting parties.</P>
<P>THE objects of &s;uck A&s;&s;ociations may be very laxly declared, or they may be very accurately limited, in the original contract. After having given examples of &s;ome of the indefinite kind, it will be in like manner &s;hown what confidence may be placed in the fidelity of the en|gagements of limitation held out by others.</P>
<P>THE in&s;tances of A&s;&s;ociations, the objects of which have been very laxly defined, are &s;o many, that it will be expedient to arrange them in &s;ome order. Tho&s;e which
<PB N="31" REF="36">have been formed under Religious Pretences, and tho&s;e on the principles of the Rights of Men, will form two Sections: in the latter no particular account of the late French Revolutions will be entered upon; they will be referred to incidentally, and by way of illu&s;tration only. Offen&s;ive A&s;&s;ociations, &s;trictly limited, will then become the &s;ubject of a &s;eparate Section.</P>
<P>POPULAR Offen&s;ive A&s;&s;ociations, under religious pre|tences, are fir&s;t to be here con&s;idered. I &s;hall begin with the Catholic League in France, which was formed in 1575. Its nominal object was to annul the famous Edict of Pacification, granted by the King to the Prote&s;tants in May the &s;ame year: hence it was an Offen&s;ive A&s;&s;ocia|tion. It was not until the death of the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, nine years after, that it was converted into an in&s;trument to further an attempt to change the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown. This was the fatal precedent of the Scotti&s;h Covenant for the abolition of Epi&s;copacy; afterwards adopted in England with &s;ome variations. By the opera|tions of the&s;e General A&s;&s;ociations, Great-Britain and France were each divided, as it were, into two ho&s;tile nations, &s;hut up in one territory, and each of them in|volved in civil wars, in u&s;urpation, and anarchy, about twenty years. This is not the fir&s;t in&s;tance in which the contagious example of a French in&s;urrection has given ri&s;e to another in this country, threatening to annihilate us as a nation: but I hope our remote&s;t po&s;terity will continue to be able to &s;ay,&mdash;It is the la&s;t.</P>
<P>THE only remaining compact falling under this divi|&s;ion, here to be noticed, is the Prote&s;tant A&s;&s;ociation under Lord George Gordon. This likewi&s;e was Offen|&s;ive,
<PB N="32" REF="37">as its object was the repeal of certain Acts made in favour of the Romani&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was the conver&s;e or counterpart of the League of the Gui&s;es.</NOTE>. The plan of his A&s;&s;ociation al&s;o, though nominally of a part of the people, was effectively general; for the proportion of the followers of the Roman Church in Britain in this age, to the number of Prote&s;tants, does not exceed that which took place in King William's time; or the hundred and &s;eventy-ninth part of the people<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rymple, from William's Papers.</NOTE>. The &s;pirit of per&s;ecution had long been dormant, and it might have been hoped was ex|tinct: for the pa&s;&s;ions of the populace had not for years been rou&s;ed again&s;t the objects to which they were now turned. Yet the direction was given to them with &s;o little preparation, as hardly to be the &s;ubject of alarm: they unexpectedly broke out into in&s;urrection, and we &s;aw them ma&s;ters of the metropolis &s;ome days, the pri|&s;ons broken down, and their vile&s;t inhabitants turned loo&s;e again upon Society, or &s;et at their head to plan and lead them on to more dangerous and enormous crimes; fires in every quarter of the City; and the Bank, the depo&s;itory of the wealth and the column of the credit of the Nation, which cannot be &s;haken without extreme hazard, or overthrown without cru&s;hing everything, be|neath it in its ponderous ruin, hardly &s;aved from their attack; when abroad we were at war with four nations, without an ally, the re&s;t of Europe looking upon our danger with a lowering and inimical neutrality, and at home we were almo&s;t torn in pieces by our inte&s;tine divi|&s;ions.</P>
<P>AS it is not pretended that any amelioration of the &s;pirit and manners of the Engli&s;h populace has taken
<PB N="33" REF="38">place &s;ince this dangerous period; we may legitimately, from this event; deduce &s;ome conclu&s;ions on the &s;tate of their di&s;po&s;itions at this juncture, directly applicable to our main &s;ubject. The inveterate &s;pirit of per&s;ecuting the Romani&s;ts, and the principles of Levelling, were the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of the Republicans of the la&s;t age. Little art or endeavour, however, has been exerted to keep the former alive, ever &s;ince it began apparently to die away. Yet we have &s;een this &s;pirit, as it were, &s;tart up, and threaten the ruin of the State. But the embers of Republicani&s;m and Levelling have, during all that period, been carefully raked up; and, for fear they &s;hould become extinct, there were hands which were &s;een from time to time &s;upplying them with a &s;uf|ficient quantity of fuel to keep them alive. The&s;e prin|ciples have been never &s;uffered to die; but lately they have been diffu&s;ed with the mo&s;t &s;y&s;tematic and malig|nant diligence, and they have been embraced with all the fervor of a new fanatici&s;m by a great number of the populace. Where Lord George Gordon made one real enthu&s;ia&s;t, the Agitators have made fifty. And is there no danger to be apprehended from the new A&s;&s;ociation, to which they will all throng to &s;ub&s;cribe, when that of Lord George Gordon, con&s;tructed with &s;o much le&s;s art and preparation, formed of &s;o much feebler materials, brought us to the brink of ruin? 'It was not,' it will be &s;aid, <Q>the real fanatics that did the mi&s;chief, but a multitude of mi&s;creants under the ma&s;k of the fanatici&s;m of religion.</Q> But are the morals of the populace improv|ed &s;ince that time? Are not &s;uch mi&s;creants mixed among them at lea&s;t in an equal proportion? And if any ma&s;k be provided for them, will they not make u&s;e of it, whether it be that of religious or political fanatici&s;m? If we urge to you the example of France, you will &s;ay, <Q>No
<PB N="34" REF="39">&s;uch violences are to be dreaded from the populace of England: they are more enlightened than the French were at the commencement of the Revolutions; that the oppre&s;&s;ions of the commonalty of France was greatly more than that cla&s;s of people experience here.</Q> As for the lights which they may po&s;&s;e&s;s, tho&s;e which have been given them &s;ince the Riots of 1780 are not of a kind to make them le&s;s forward in in&s;urrec|tion; and as for oppre&s;&s;ion, the poor man &s;uffers none here: he has been taught, indeed, to give that name to the whole amount of the taxes; as well of tho&s;e which do not, as tho&s;e which do affect him: this total is his re|puted mea&s;ure thereof; and it has been increa&s;ed in the&s;e la&s;t fifteen years. Popular tumults are therefore to all appearance more probable, more big with the pro&s;pect of national ruin now, than they were on the day preceding the in&s;urrection of the Prote&s;tant A&s;&s;ociation. And when you call upon us to rely upon the good &s;en&s;e of the populace to make a ju&s;t compari&s;on of their own &s;tate with that of the lower cla&s;&s;es of other nations; by exaggerating the increa&s;e of the taxes, and declaiming<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the&s;e declamations, the fact that the ma&s;s of the new taxes affects the Upper Orders only, is &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> perpetually and with extrava|gance upon it, you endeavour to make the re&s;ult of that com|pari&s;on fal&s;e, on which you call upon us to depend. With their minds thus prepared, whether the fanatici&s;m infu&s;ed into them for that purpo&s;e be either of the kind called religious or political, or both conjointly, they generally effect all the de&s;truction in their power: and if their a&s;&s;ociation now become general throughout the kingdom, their power will have no limit. It may be a&s;ked now, what will become of that po&s;ition &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on, that <Q>nothing but real grievances will drive the popu|lace
<PB N="35" REF="40">into in&s;urrection and violence; that their wrath, though often dreadful in its con&s;equences, is always ju&s;t in its cau&s;e and commencement; that though they may rea&s;on ill, the effect of the errors of their judgement always pa&s;&s;es off in harmle&s;s and empty noi&s;e; and that they never begin to act but from their feelings only, which cannot deceive them.</Q> In this in&s;urrection we &s;ee a &s;trong in&s;tance of the fal&s;ity of this opinion, which many have endeavoured to &s;up|port from different motives, in order to impre&s;s upon us a belief of the infallibility of the people, when they come into political action. The humane indulgence ex|tended to a re&s;pectable but per&s;ecuted &s;ect in 1780, was no grievance which the populace felt anything from. It even attacked no prejudice which had any active opera|tion in their minds the day before this A&s;&s;ociation was planned: and the event clearly &s;hows, that fal&s;e ab&s;tract principles may be infu&s;ed into them; prejudices long dor|mant may be re-excited as it were in a moment, and in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly produce an in&s;urrection which may hazard or de&s;troy the exi&s;tence of Civil Government.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI. ON THE SPIRIT OF POPULAR OFFENSIVE ASSOCIATIONS, ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN (SO CALLED).</HEAD>
<P>EVERY in&s;tance in Hi&s;tory of the fatal effects of re|ligious fanatici&s;m has, in this age, been &s;tudiou&s;ly and invidiou&s;ly collected, and brought forward to public view; but tho&s;e of combinations and a&s;&s;ociations to ob|tain Political Equality, and to vindicate what are now
<PB N="36" REF="41">called the Rights of Men, have been little enquired after; and France is very generally &s;uppo&s;ed recently to have exhibited the fir&s;t example of the calamities they have produced. I have often wondered at the prevalence of this opinion, and it would have been fortunate for human kind, and for that fine country in particular, if it had been true. But her fate has re&s;embled too much that of the beautiful and cultivated tracts which lie round the ba&s;e and a&s;cend part of the &s;ides of Mount Ve&s;uvius: the volcano &s;eems extinct for ages; the harve&s;t, the vine|yard, the farm, the villa, the palace, and every mark of fertility, cultivation, and &s;plendor, &s;eem to have made it their &s;elected &s;pot: but the periodical eruption returns, and a conflagration &s;weeps all the&s;e beauties from the earth.</P>
<P>WHEN the populace is brought into action, they will ultimately be governed in their conduct by the mo&s;t vio|lent &s;et of principles which has infected any large &s;ec|tion of them. This point is laid down &s;imply now; I &s;hall return to the con&s;ideration of it. But the princi|ple of the Equality of Right, and that under&s;tood in its mo&s;t fatal &s;en&s;e, has been long fermenting among, and at length infected no &s;mall part of the lower cla&s;&s;es of Society in Europe. While, therefore, we look upon the late calamities of France as a political phenomenon, &s;in|gle and unprecedented in its kind, when it is only one in&s;tance among many, we e&s;timate the greatne&s;s of our hazard much beneath its magnitude, which increa&s;es in proportion to the number of &s;uch events that have taken place during the period of authentic hi&s;tory, and like|wi&s;e with the relaxation of our watchfulne&s;s cau&s;ed by this error; which is more &s;ingular, as our own Hi&s;tory

<P>THE fir&s;t country which the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> modern metaphy|&s;ical philo&s;ophy of politics deluged with the blood of its inhabitants, was Judea.

Thus we &s;ee the orators of the Palais Royal and Copenhagen Hou&s;e had their predece&s;|&s;ors in Judea.

<P N="2">II. INSURRECTION OF THE BAGAUDAE, IN THE REIGN OF DIOCLESIAN.</P>

<P N="3">III. INSURRECTION OF THE JACQUERIE, IN THE REIGN OF JOHN OF FRANCE.</P>
<P>THE next irruption of this kind, which laid wa&s;te France, took place in 1358. It re&s;embled that of 1789 &s;o much, not only in its general character, but in par|ticular circum&s;tances, that we &s;eem almo&s;t to be read|ing the &s;ame hi&s;tory under different names.

The principle on which this in&s;urrection was formed, was, according to Gibbon, the &s;ame as the former;&mdash; <Q>to a&s;&s;ert the natural rights of men.</Q> In his 17th note to c. 13. he refers for the particulars of it to Froi&s;&s;art.

<P>THE war with England had exhau&s;ted the re&s;ources of France; King John was a pri&s;oner in London; the Dauphin, then of the age of eighteen, a&s;&s;umed the exer|ci&s;e of the Government, and having obtained a truce of two years of the Engli&s;h, he called an A&s;&s;embly of the States to procure &s;upplies. Here he found every Order negligent of the public di&s;tre&s;s, and de&s;irous only to aug|ment its own power: he therefore ha&s;tened their &s;epara|tion. At that juncture, Charles the Bad, King of Na|varre, who had great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in France, a&s;pired to the Throne. We have &s;een him and his crimes re|vived in one of his de&s;cendants, the late Duke of Or|leans.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="46">CHARLES of Navarre had been able to gain to his party the &s;editious <HI>Prev&ocirc;t des Marchands,</HI> or Mayor of Paris, Marcel, and that factious populace.

I mu&s;t candidly remark here, that the colour of this cap was blue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I find in an Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory of France, that the cap was &s;triped blue and red; I cannot &s;ettle this important matter. It is more to the point to ob&s;erve, from the &s;ame Hi&s;tory, that the palace was forced by 3000 citizens, each of whom wore the cap: as they moved under the order of the Mayor, they were probably a part of what has been &s;ince called the National Guard belonging to that city. Both the Dauphin, though extremely young, and the King of Navarre, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great popular eloquence; they frequently ha|rangued bodies of citizens.</P></NOTE>, and not red. The Dau|phin-Regent was forced to di&s;&s;emble his re&s;entment, and to take all in good part.</P>
<P>AFTER this in&s;ult, he was detained in a kind of capti|vity; in which &s;tate a poi&s;on was admini&s;tered to him, by which he lo&s;t his hair and his nails. This was &s;u&s;|pected to have been done by the direction of the King of Navarre.</P>
<P>IN the meantime the faction at Paris, though &s;eem|ingly inclined to Charles, was more di&s;po&s;ed to change France into an effective Republic than to pull down one
<PB N="42" REF="47">King in order to &s;et up another. The plan of the leaders of the in&s;urgents of Paris of that time was preci&s;ely copied in the fir&s;t of the new French Con&s;titutions; it was <Q>to change the form of the Government, to ve&s;t the &s;upreme power in the Third E&s;tate, and to leave the King his title with little or no authority.</Q> This was the Con&s;titution propo&s;ed by that metropolis to the other cities, but then rejected by them. It was not until &s;ome little time after that their minds <HI>were elevated to the height of &s;uch a Revolution</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dumouriez.</NOTE>. But the Regent, who had been obliged to temporize and di&s;&s;emble, having been &s;o fortu|nate as to e&s;cape out of Paris, and <HI>not to be intercepted in his flight,</HI> that capital and the other cities of the kingdom &s;hook off the Royal authority, took the Government into their own hands, and &s;pread di&s;order into every Province; and the troops, left without pay, no longer regarded their Officers, or were re&s;trained by any di&s;cipline from indi&s;|criminate plunder.</P>
<P>YET this devoted country was to be afflicted with the addition of another calamity, in weight and magnitude ex|ceeding the total of what it then &s;uffered: this was the in|&s;urrection of the Jacquerie or pea&s;antry. The populace of the cities had found employment for the exerci&s;e of the new lights they had obtained in the &s;chool of the meta|phy&s;ical politicians, in the e&s;tabli&s;hing of their new muni|cipalities or little independent republics; de&s;tined, perhaps, if their progre&s;s to the perfection of civil &s;ociety had not received a check, to have become the in&s;ulated and repul|&s;ive elements of a prior French Republic, one and indivi|&s;ible. The principles of this A&s;&s;ociation, as it has been
<PB N="43" REF="48">already remarked, have been a&s;&s;igned by Gibbon, who par|ticularly profe&s;&s;es to have examined the original accounts of them him&s;elf, for the purpo&s;e of acquiring light to fix the character of a &s;imilar event. The&s;e in&s;urgents, he &s;ays, "a&s;&s;erted the natural Rights of Man." It has been proved, that he ought not to be accu&s;ed of having &s;ur|veyed the occurrences of this period with an eye tinctured with the prejudices of the pre&s;ent; of having corrupted the faith of hi&s;tory to inflame what is called liberticidal prejudice.</P>
<P>THE Members of the Jacquerie did not repel the vio|lence of the citizens and &s;oldiers as an injury to them|&s;elves; they followed it as an example. The object of their fury was the Gentry; whom, while they were recovering their own rights, they upbraided with cowar|dice for de&s;erting their Sovereign at the battle of Poictiers. From this precedent, perhaps, has ari&s;en the con&s;tant &s;ub|&s;equent practice of tho&s;e who are endeavouring to convert a Monarchy into a Republic, to ma&s;k their fir&s;t mea&s;ures under great profe&s;&s;ions of zeal for the honour, happine&s;s, and dignity of the Prince.</P>
<P><Q>THE ca&s;tles of the gentry were con&s;umed by fire, and levelled to the ground; and they were hunted like wild bea&s;ts, and put to the &s;word without mercy. The &s;a|vages proceeded &s;o far as to impale &s;ome gentlemen and roa&s;t them alive before a &s;low fire. Their wives and daughters were fir&s;t ravi&s;hed, and then murdered: a body of 9000 of them broke into Meaux, where the wife of the Dauphin, with above 300 Ladies, had taken &s;hel|ter: the mo&s;t brutal treatment and mo&s;t atrocious cru|elty were ju&s;tly dreaded by this helple&s;s company: but
<PB N="44" REF="49">the Captal de Buche, though in the &s;ervice of Edward, yet moved by genero&s;ity and the <HI>gallantry of a true knight,</HI> flew to their relief, and beat off the pea&s;ants with great &s;laughter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Hume, vol. ii. p. 478.</P>

<P><PB N="45" REF="50">ONE ob&s;ervation mu&s;t be here made on the proximate cau&s;e of both the&s;e &s;anguinary in&s;urrections, adverting more particularly to the latter.</P>
<P>FROM the very nature of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that either of the&s;e calamitous periods was di&s;|tingui&s;hed by any extraordinary oppre&s;&s;ion of the lower orders by the Nobility or Gentry. Previous to the latter, the arms of Edward, and the intrigues of the King of Navarre, had long kept France in a mo&s;t un&s;ettled &s;tate; and the Nobility mu&s;t have felt, for a con&s;iderable term of time, an increa&s;ing want of the attachment of their va&s;&s;als, and, con&s;equently, been obliged to treat them with more than ordinary regard. Be&s;ide, it is by no means certain, that in the &s;emi-barbarous &s;tate in which France was then plunged, the burthen of the feudal &s;ervices exceeded the value of the protection the tenant then received from his lord: the latter at that time might be e&s;teemed fully equal to the former. As it was a well-known practice for tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed allodial lands, or &s;uch as were free from feudal
<PB N="46" REF="51">&s;ervices, as our freeholds, to convey them over to &s;ome neighbouring baron, who engaged to grant them back again to the former owner, liable to the feudal &s;ervices of his barony; that thus the former independent proprietor, by becoming a va&s;&s;al, might acquire a right to the protec|tion of his new lord. Tho&s;e &s;ervices he therefore volun|tarily, engaged in, becau&s;e what he gave was not of the &s;ame value to him as what he acquired: and they were undoubtedly of the kind called privileged or definite: he certainly did not thereby &s;ubmit him&s;elf to a &s;tate of villenage in gro&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">IV. INSURRECTION UNDER WAT TYLER IN ENGLAND, IN THE REIGN OF RICHARD THE SECOND.</P>
<P>THESE events in France mu&s;t in all probability have pro|duced the fir&s;t party of <HI>Alarmi&s;ts,</HI> who then held out the danger of the&s;e principles getting footing here; and it is al&s;o probable, that there were many Engli&s;h in that age, &s;ome from that levity which derides all trouble&s;ome fore&s;ight; &s;ome not favouring their ultimate &s;ucce&s;s, but de&s;irous to promote their own oblique purpo&s;es by their temporary exten&s;ion and prevalence; and others who de&s;ired to &s;ee them adopted in practice to their utmo&s;t extent; who treated the melancholy declamations of the Alarmi&s;ts of the Four|teenth Century, on the calamities to be apprehended at home, from the effect of the in&s;urrection of the antient Jacobins or Jacquerie upon the minds of the populace, with the ridicule the &s;ame apprehen&s;ions meet in our days: the verification their predictions received from the event, the politicians de&s;cribed above do their utmo&s;t to give to tho&s;e of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; and they may &s;ucceed. In the time of the Jacquerie, Edward the Third &s;at upon the
<PB N="47" REF="52">Throne; and the vigour of his admini&s;tration, and the po|pularity of his brilliant reign, mu&s;t have been a great re|&s;traint upon tho&s;e principles from bur&s;ting forth into pre|&s;ent action: but the di&s;temper of the minds of the popu|lace, though latent, was probably &s;preading during its lowering decline. It broke out in the minority of Richard. Seditious orators were not then wanted to propagate the &s;acred duty of in&s;urrection; the name of one of them is handed down to us: John Ball, a prie&s;t, went about the country, inculcating on his audience <Q>the equal right to liberty, and to all the goods of nature; the tyranny of artificial di&s;tinctions; and the idea of primitive equali|ty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume's Hi&s;t. vol. iii. p. 7, 8.</NOTE>.</Q> To borrow a metaphor from a modern writer of great eminence, it was thus a mine was dug to blow up civil &s;ociety; a poll tax had been granted by parliament, and an in&s;ult offered by an abandoned collector to the daughter of a black&s;mith, &s;et fire to the train which led to it. The populace of E&s;&s;ex, Kent, Hertford&s;hire, Su&s;&s;ex, Surrey, Suffolk, Norfolk, and the counties of Cambridge and Lincoln, immediately flew to arms: and before the Government had the lea&s;t warning of the danger, the di&s;or|der had ri&s;en beyond controul or oppo&s;ition: the mo&s;t audacious and criminal of their leaders a&s;&s;umed the feigned names of Tyler, Straw, Carter, or Miller, <Q>by which they were fond of denoting their mean origin.</Q> Thus tho&s;e who borrow their principles from France now bor|row from the &s;ame country the gro&s;s name of <HI>Sans Culottes.</HI> In all in&s;urrections of this character the populace are con|&s;tantly actuated by one motive, "the purpo&s;e of levelling all mankind:" the means too by which its end is pur&s;ued are always the &s;ame: <Q>the in&s;urgents committed the mo&s;t

This event being recorded in our own Hi&s;tory, I &s;hall be more particular in my ob&s;ervations upon it.</P>
<P>THE con&s;truction and mode of working that machinery, which is to di&s;organi&s;e Society we &s;ee was not then totally unknown: and the means to diffu&s;e con&s;titutional infor|mation employed in that period were the &s;ame as are now in practice, if we except the pre&s;s, that mo&s;t powerful en|gine to promote the be&s;t and the wor&s;t ends; and on the balance, for a certain period after the commencement of the attack, a formidable addition to dangers of this kind. The minds of the populace were regularly prepared for in&s;urrection in the manner de&s;cribed; and the principle of equalizing, then copied from the French, was the pre|di&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e of this unhappy and &s;anguinary commo|tion. The criminal in&s;olence of a tax-gatherer, repelled
<PB N="49" REF="54">by an immediate murder, was the occa&s;ion or premature &s;ignal only, which brought this &s;pirit into action, not the primary origin of the &s;eries of events which then com|menced.</P>
<P>THE principles of &s;edition preached by John Ball have a &s;ingular &s;imilitude to tho&s;e now &s;olicitou&s;ly propagated. We are able to trace in them the great outline of tho&s;e laid down in the advice of Mr. Barlow to the Privileged Orders. This is evident in the account given of the former from Hume. It is worth the while only to in&s;tance particularly one of the&s;e points of re&s;emblance, which is curious and &s;triking. Mr. Ball, in his Homilies on the Rights of Man, preached on "their equal title to all the goods of nature;" and Mr. Barlow, that <Q>every man is born with an impre|&s;criptible claim to a portion of the elements, which por|tion is termed his birthright<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Second edition, p. iii.</NOTE>.</Q> We &s;ee both of them lay down the &s;ame doctrine in the &s;ame guarded manner; half holding forth to the populace, and half keeping back, an expectation of an equal divi&s;ion of lands. This Century had not the honour of fir&s;t di&s;covering this fine principle of tribunitial morality, in the cla&s;&s;ical records, or of the re|invention of it.</P>
<P>THERE &s;eems to me little rea&s;on to a&s;cribe the mi&s;eries in which this in&s;urrection involved England, at that parti|cular point of time, to any other cau&s;e than the contagion of the principles which had prevailed in France &s;ome time before. I &s;hall, however, &s;tate and con&s;ider what may be &s;aid again&s;t this.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="55">MR. HUME joins another with it, on the authority of Froi&s;&s;art, <Q>that per&s;onal &s;lavery was then more general in England, than in any other country in Europe.</Q> He him&s;elf, in &s;ome places, has cen&s;ured that Writer, as falling into many errors in point of fact; but there is one circum&s;tance which &s;hews, that the number of &s;laves (by which I &s;uppo&s;e villeins in gro&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Transferrable, by &s;ale or deed, from one owner to another.</NOTE> to be meant) mu&s;t, in that age, have been very greatly reduced.

<P>FURTHER, to &s;hew that nothing is contained in this in&s;tance, tending to demon&s;trate that a calamity of the like nature is probable at pre&s;ent, it will be &s;aid, that <Q>the&s;e were the exce&s;&s;es of a barbarous age, but that the diffu&s;ion of light in Society has humanized the manners of every cla&s;s of mankind, and that this is particularly the ca&s;e of England at this period; and although in the Fourteenth Century, the populace both here and in France were equally involved in darkne&s;s, and led with the fame facility into atrocious crimes; that the lower orders in this kingdom have, in the former of the&s;e re&s;pects, and con&s;equently in the latter, in this age, a relative &s;uperiority over their neighbours, which they were by no means entitled to boa&s;t of in the age of Edward the Third. The conclu&s;ion of this is obvious: that a danger &s;o probable then as ju&s;tly to have been the &s;ubject of alarm, mu&s;t be totally vi&s;ionary now.</Q></P>
<P>BUT it cannot be admitted that the populace of Eng|land were then &s;o totally involved in ignorance as this objection &s;uppo&s;es; for whenever a certain portion of knowledge on any one &s;ubject becomes generally diffu&s;ed
<PB N="52" REF="57">among the upper cla&s;&s;es of a State, their inferiors will &s;oon become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that part thereof, which their relative &s;ituation permits them to acquire. The increa&s;e of the information of the former becomes di&s;&s;eminated among the latter, by the middle cla&s;s, conver&s;ing ordina|rily with both. And the feudal &s;y&s;tem tended to in&s;ure this, in the age which is under con&s;ideration; not only by the frequent attendance of the va&s;&s;als in the courts of their Lords, but by the multitudes of retainers which their ho&s;pitality, their o&s;tentation, or their love of war, induced them to live &s;urrounded by. The&s;e originally taken from, occa&s;ionally mixing with, and ultimately returning to the body of the common people, diffu&s;ed among them the outline of every new opinion, as &s;oon as it was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. The propagation of new ideas throughout the whole of Society, was not much le&s;s rapid then than it is now; much of the effect of the di&s;covery of printing be|ing counterbalanced by the change of cu&s;toms in this par|ticular; and thus perhaps the feudal &s;y&s;tem contained within it&s;elf the &s;eeds of its own decline.</P>
<P>NOW from a detail of numerous circum&s;tances pre|&s;erved to us is hi&s;tory, it appears, that the upper cla&s;&s;es in the reigns of Edward the Third and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, were far advanced in general knowledge, and particularly in that of political, commercial, and con&s;titutional prin|ciples: in&s;omuch that it &s;eems that the nation was, in the&s;e re&s;pects, in a retrograde &s;tate, from the age of Edward the Third to the acce&s;&s;ion of the Tudors, and that it did not re-acquire its former point of advance upon the whole, until the reigns of the fir&s;t Scotti&s;h Princes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, No. II.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="58">In the hi&s;tory of France for the &s;ame period, I recol|lect none of the&s;e circum&s;tances, and I think it would be in vain to &s;earch for them: for the greater part of the&s;e improvements were mo&s;t probably &s;o early called forth in England, by the in&s;titution of a Hou&s;e of Commons re|latively new, and then beginning to produce its effects on the &s;pirit and ideas of the nation.</P>
<P>OF this knowledge, according to what is ob&s;erved above, every cla&s;s of the nation mu&s;t have imbibed its &s;hare, according to its powers of ab&s;orption: the genius of the age prevented its being confined. If, therefore, we compare the Engli&s;h populace of that period with that of France, as great a &s;uperiority at lea&s;t mu&s;t then be al|lowed to them in u&s;eful knowledge as can be admitted now: but the event &s;hewed, that the difference in that age was not enough to protect this nation from the expe|rience of many, and the hazard of all the mi&s;eries which had recently overwhelmed France. And as that diffe|rence is not increa&s;ed, it is a folly which tends to the la&s;t extremity of national ruin, to rely upon it more firmly now.</P>
<P>THERE is another point of view likewi&s;e, in which the in&s;urrection of the Fourteenth Century requires con&s;ide|ration. The late &s;ubver&s;ions of the Governments of Hol|land and of France &s;hew us, that there is almo&s;t as much to fear as to hope from regular troops: and if we look to a force on which we can place unlimited confidence, in oppo&s;ition to &s;uch an in&s;urrection, at this juncture; from the revolution which has taken place in the &s;tate and manners of Society, we &s;hall &s;ee that force greatly weak|ened. In the feudal ages, the upper and opulent cla&s;&s;es
<PB N="54" REF="59">were chiefly military men. Hence, though the encoun|ter was terrible, they finally prevailed, by the advantage of di&s;cipline and military habits. On a late occa&s;ion, from the decay of them, we have &s;een the gentry and no|bility of France unable to make a &s;tand, and &s;wept away almo&s;t without re&s;i&s;tance: a country where the educa|tion of a camp was much more general among the &s;upe|rior orders than in Britain. Admit now the chance of in&s;urrection to be le&s;s than here &s;tated, the danger to be apprehended is from the chance of attack, and the weak|ne&s;s of the means of defence jointly: if that chance de|crea&s;e, and the &s;trength of defence decrea&s;e in the &s;ame proportion, the danger of the State remains &s;till the &s;ame</P>
<P N="5">5. OTHER INSURRECTIONS TO ASSERT THE RIGHTS OF MANT.</P>
<P>SOME other in&s;urrections will be here mentioned, that a general conclu&s;ion may he drawn from the whole of them; but with little detail of their particular inci|dents.</P>
<P>IN the feeble reign of Henry the Sixth, Cade rai&s;ed a formidable commotion, under a pretence of a Reduction of taxes, and a Reform in the State; but no trace of the Levelling principle is to be found in his Declarations or his conduct: an article in his Manife&s;to in favour of the old again&s;t the new nobility, &s;eems even in the mo&s;t dia|metrical oppo&s;ition to it, and he is generally e&s;teemed to have been an in&s;trument of the Duke of York. This is noticed, as the only in&s;tance I recollect in the Hi&s;tory of this country of the more dangerous in&s;urrections of the populace, which was not founded on the doctrine of the Equality of the Rights of Man.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="60">AFTER the death of I&s;abella of Ca&s;tile, in 1503, the Regency of that kingdom was di&s;puted between her hu&s;|band Ferdinand of Arragon and the Au&s;trian Princes. During the following &s;ixteen years, a kind of turbulent Interregnum prevailed in Spain, with intervals of regu|lar government. The Royal power being by the&s;e vici&s;&s;i|tudes weakened, a democratic faction aro&s;e, con&s;iderated under the title of the <HI>Germania,</HI> the Brotherhood, or A&s;&s;ociation of the People. It involved Spain in di&s;cord and blood&s;hed for nearly two years. The Progre&s;s of Civil Society toward anarchy in that time in the king|doms of Spain, was nearly the &s;ame as what we recently &s;aw it in France in the &s;ame period: it was advanced &s;o far, that two clothworkers and a tanner ruled the debates of their Third E&s;tates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Further particulars of this in&s;urrection are given in the APPEN|Dtx; the&s;e di&s;orders having pa&s;&s;ed into Germany, and thence hither.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO the &s;tern government of Henry the Eighth in England, &s;ucceeded the feeble minority of Edward the Sixth, and the feeble Protectorate of his uncle the Duke of Somer&s;et, continually traver&s;ed by his factious bro|ther, and his intriguing &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Popular commotions aro&s;e in &s;everal parts of the kingdom: &s;ome in&s;urgents took arms on account of religion, others were what Ba|ker calls "Commonwealth Mutineers." The object of the three greater bodies was to form a junction: one of them declared for no King, the de&s;truction of the nobi|lity and gentry, and holding a <HI>Parliament in commotion,</HI> which &s;hould begin at the South and North Seas of England. Another for no Gentry, no Lawyers, no
<PB N="56" REF="61">Judges, no Ju&s;tices, no Inclo&s;ures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bakers Chronicle.</NOTE>. It was with diffi|culty and great exertion that two of the&s;e bodies were &s;e|parately conquered, on which the third di&s;per&s;ed. If the projected junction had taken place, it would mo&s;t pro|bably have involved the whole kingdom in a de&s;olation equal to that in which the Jacquerie involved France.</P>
<P>ONE con&s;equence is plainly deducible, from a view of all the&s;e accounts conjointly, that the executive power of the Sovereign can never be both &s;uddenly and greatly weakened or relaxed below its accu&s;tomed tone, without expo&s;ing Society to the hazard of that mo&s;t dreadful of calamities, the tyranny of Levelling principles, or tho&s;e of Equality: for the latter term bears no other &s;en&s;e in the conception of the multitude, and is intended to convey this to them, by the great majority of tho&s;e who affectedly dwell upon it. This &s;pirit is ready to break out on all &s;uch occa&s;ions: and this we have &s;een it do when John of France was a pri&s;oner to a foreign ene|my; when Charles the Fir&s;t and Louis the Sixteenth were pri&s;oners to their own &s;ubjects; during the feeble and di&s;tracted minorities of Richard the Second and Ed|ward the Sixth, and in the effective Interregnum follow|ing the death of I&s;abella of Ca&s;tile.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH this is the mo&s;t permanent and gene|ral of the irregular pa&s;&s;ions acting upon the minds of the populace, it &s;ometimes gives place to others; which, if they happen to be predominant at a time when the Royal power is &s;uddenly dimini&s;hed, the former will not appear in action, but the latter will
<PB N="57" REF="62">produce the &s;ame effect. Thus in Ireland, when the vigo|rous, and in &s;ome in&s;tances perhaps the arbitrary, admini|&s;tration of Lord Strafford was removed, and it be|came evident that Charles the Fir&s;t was a King in came only, and that his government had very little effective power; the long &s;uppre&s;&s;ed re&s;entments of the Iri&s;h again&s;t the Engli&s;h, and their ferocious bi|gotry, broke out in the Iri&s;h Rebellion and Ma&s;&s;acre. This &s;eeming exception gives an indirect but &s;trong &s;upport, to one of the propo&s;itions on which the pre|ceding conclu&s;ion is founded. But to confine our&s;elves to the principles of the ?Commonwealth Mutineers."</P>
<P>HENCE it may be laid down as a general fact, that when the power which keeps the lower people in &s;ubordi|nation, be it equal to, or more than the degree every good man would wi&s;h to have permanently e&s;tabli&s;hed in a State, be of a &s;udden greatly dimini&s;hed, in|&s;urrections of this kind will be the con&s;equence of it; for if it be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that Governors are always endeavouring to increa&s;e their coercive power, yet when we &s;ee it for a con&s;iderable term of years &s;tationary, notwith&s;tanding that perpetual effort, we know that the &s;pirit of re&s;i&s;tance of the People in that generation is preci&s;ely equal to the whole of that power. Dimini&s;h the latter greatly, and the ela&s;ticity of the former will ca&s;t the remaining weight entirely off. Such diminutions mu&s;t be made by degrees, and an at|tentive and accurate admini&s;tration of the powers left, will &s;upply the place of the ruder compre&s;&s;ion that is removed, until the people become accu&s;tomed to enjoy their new degree of liberty with temperance: then it becomes capa|ble of a &s;econd further exten&s;ion, and not before. In the
<PB N="58" REF="63">progre&s;&s;ive growth of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, we &s;ee an illu&s;tration of this: we may de&s;cribe it in the &s;ame terms in which Tacitus de&s;cribes that of the Roman Empire from its origin to its highe&s;t point of grandeur, <HI>Octingentorum annorum fortun&acirc; &amp; di&s;ciplin&acirc; compages haec coaluit</HI> &mdash; This noble edifice was erected by the fortune and virtue of eight hundred years. Every cour&s;e of ma&s;onry was &s;uffered to &s;ettle and con&s;olidate as it was carried up. The period, indeed, was long: but in ages of barbari&s;m and &s;emibarbari&s;m, this work will, and perhaps ought to proceed, very tardily.</P>
<P>IT follows from all the in&s;tances given in this Sec|tion, that offen&s;ive popular A&s;&s;ociations, on principles called tho&s;e of the Rights of Men, have always been at|tended with the mo&s;t tragical con&s;equences; and it mu&s;t be added, that this has not ari&s;en &s;olely from accident, or the circum&s;tances of the times in which the experi|ment has been made, but from the principle it&s;elf, which is contrary to the legitimate con&s;equences of the laws of human nature. It re&s;ts to be &s;hewn, that on whatever ground a &s;trong Offen&s;ive A&s;&s;ociation &s;hall at this time begin to act, it will be pre&s;ently lo&s;t &s;ight of, and this &s;ub&s;tituted in its place.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. ON OFFENSIVE ASSOCIATIONS, THE OBJECTS OF WHICH ARE LIMITED.</HEAD>
<P>THE objects of the&s;e A&s;&s;ociations,' it will be &s;aid, <Q>were extreme and mo&s;tly indefinite. Had their Leaders, at the beginning, laid down certain ends or limits, the cala|mities
<PB N="59" REF="64">above de&s;cribed would never have happened; or, at lea&s;t, the greater part of them would have been avoided: their operations would have cea&s;ed as &s;oon as the&s;e fixed points had been attained: and, to rea&s;on of the pre&s;ent time&mdash;Suppo&s;e the wor&s;t: &s;uppo&s;e even that there &s;hould exi&s;t a Party in Great Britain, with whom the tie of al|legiance is of no force, and that they might be looked upon in the &s;ame light as a body of foreign enemies within the realm; yet from foreign enemies we &s;hould entertain a full expectation of peace, or ce&s;&s;ation of ho|&s;tilities, on our performance of &s;uch conditions as they propo&s;e and we accede to. And &s;hall we entertain of Engli&s;hmen, doubts that would be injurious to a fo|reign enemy? Can we think &s;o ill of our country|men? Have they rejected every principle analogous to the Law which binds ho&s;tile nations, which can pre&s;erve the good faith of <HI>ho&s;tile parties</HI> to each other?</Q></P>
<P>IT may be the belief of the majority of the original Leaders of an Offen&s;ive A&s;&s;ociation, that they ought, and it may be their determination that they will act up to their engagements; but if they be at the head of a Party, combined on the principles taught as the Rights of Man, &s;uch Leaders may <HI>bona fide</HI> make the attempt to act up to their original Manife&s;to; but the probability runs very &s;trongly again&s;t their being able to effect their purpo&s;e: for whatever principles they may &s;et out with, the ex|treme and mo&s;t violent that their lower adherents &s;hall have imbibed, prior to their A&s;&s;ociation, or that they &s;hall pick up in the cour&s;e of the &s;truggle, will mo&s;t pro|bably be tho&s;e ultimately acted upon.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="65">I SHALL here &s;how the reality and magnitude of this danger, from the examples of the mo&s;t enlightened na|tions, and in their mo&s;t enlightened periods. It mu&s;t be on this occa&s;ion &s;uppo&s;ed that it will not be di&s;puted, that when the heads of a Party declare that they will pre&s;erve any one part of a Con&s;titution, in its exi&s;ting &s;tate, they thereby impo&s;e limits upon their own operations; and that as much reliance may be placed on tho&s;e they im|po&s;e upon them&s;elves in the cour&s;e of action, as if they had laid them down immediately before they began to act. To attempt to di&s;tingui&s;h between the validity of the two &s;ecurities, would be to make a di&s;tinction without a dif|ference, unle&s;s it be contended, that when the Leaders of &s;uch a Party have begun their &s;eries of mea&s;ures, they lo&s;e entirely the power or the with to ob&s;erve their en|gagements; but an opponent who &s;hall re&s;t upon this concedes the whole argument.</P>
<P>THE object of Mr. Fox's A&s;&s;ociation is clearly limited.

But we have had the calamity to &s;ee a very recent and terrible example of the failure of an engagement, defined with as much pre|ci&s;ion as that now held out to us, and which was con|tracted with a more awful &s;olemnity. It was on the 7th of July 1792, that M.

Bri&s;&s;ot a&s;cended the tribune to pronounce a di&s;cour&s;e on the means of &s;ecuring the State again&s;t all its enemies.</Q> It was at the very cri&s;is of the Revolution: the army of the Pru&s;&s;ians and Au&s;trians were advancing in France: no adequate force was prepared to oppo&s;e them; and when &s;uch a man brought forward &s;uch a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion at &s;uch a time, no doubt can be entertained that the Leaders and the body of his Party were pre&s;ent; and all pre&s;ent con|curred in this &s;olemn Prote&s;t. It was on the 10th of the following month the Tuilleries were attacked, and the King depo&s;ed. Bri&s;&s;ot, Louvet, and Barbaroux, in their public &s;peeches and writings, a&s;&s;erted that this Revolu|tion was effected by them, and their a&s;&s;ociates, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a Republic: and that the day originally fixed on to carry it into execution was the 29th of July<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Moores Journal, v. 2. p. 614.</NOTE>, twenty-two days only after this public declaration. Now if twenty-two days was a &s;pace of time long enough for arranging the plan of the in&s;urrection, and making the nece&s;&s;ary preparation for it, the Bri&s;&s;otine Party mu&s;t almo&s;t in&s;tantly have gone from the making this Prote&s;t to the direct violation of it. If the period were &s;o &s;hort that they cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed at fir&s;t to have expected to be able to bring about &s;o great an event, in &s;o little a time after the fir&s;t conception of it (which &s;eems almo&s;t certain), then the con&s;piracy exi&s;ted at the time this &s;olemn en|gagement was entered into; and the only object of the Republican Con&s;pirators, in taking the Prote&s;tation, was to ca&s;t a nece&s;&s;ary veil for a few days over tho&s;e mea&s;ures

<P>THUS the Declaration again&s;t Republicani&s;m was vio|lated: the remaining half of the Prote&s;tation continued uninfringed &s;ome little time longer.

Such is the le&s;&s;on recent experience holds forth to us, on the faith that is to he put in the engagements of this kind, &s;olemnly entered into by the Leaders of a People, enlightened by the torch of Philo&s;o|phy, kindled at the &s;acred and eternal fire, on the altar of Liberty and Equality. The&s;e men, the&s;e means, this act have been defended&mdash;Defended did I &s;ay?

And will not the&s;e idolizers of the violation, and the viola|tors of one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn compact on record, emu|lou&s;ly; follow the example they adore? At the commence|ment of this year, a &s;econd &s;olemn farce, the &s;ame in form, but oppo&s;ite in its engagements, was exhibited at the com|memoration of the beheading of the King; the members of the two a&s;&s;emblies &s;wore dete&s;tation to Royalty.

Vane had, indeed, the addre&s;s to have the Article on this &s;ubject drawn &s;o, that it did not ab&s;olutely bear the &s;en&s;e the Scots put upon it: but the Parliament executed it in that &s;en&s;e, and the concurrence of both the contracting parties thereto, e&s;tabli&s;hes what is to be received as the meaning of the ambiguous phra&s;e he in&s;erted.</P>
<P>THIS engagement the Parliament &s;ub&s;cribed them|&s;elves, and they ordered it to be received by all who liv|ed under their authority. It may be pretended, that this change was ju&s;tified by a change of religion in the body of the people; but this is a po&s;ition which cannot be &s;upported. It is not digre&s;&s;ing from my purpo&s;e to &s;hew this, for it proves that a cabal of leading men may draw a great part of the nation into an A&s;&s;ociation with them; one condition of which &s;hall be, to pre&s;erve inviolate &s;ome in&s;titutions for which the people entertain the highe&s;t reverence; and obtaining political power by this means, the Junto, or a part of them, &s;hall convert that very power to effect the abolition of what they originally engaged to defend.</P>
<P>AT the meeting of the Long Parliament, the Puritans were by no means the majority of the nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, v. 6. p. 302, 303.</NOTE>. There
<PB N="66" REF="71">was not a le&s;s proportion of the Sectaries in the Hou&s;e of Commons than in the kingdom at large: and the Prote|&s;tation in 1641 could not have been voted by an A&s;&s;em|bly where the majority, or even a numerous and active Party were of that de&s;cription. The doctrine of the Pu|ritans had taken root before, and its followers were in|crea&s;ing; but when it attained its utmo&s;t growth, under the &s;helter of that Party who began as reformers, and ended as &s;ubverters of the legal Con&s;titution, they &s;till continued to be a minority in the nation; and the Cove|nant was impo&s;ed by force, or the fear of force, upon the majority of the people. Of this we have the be&s;t cotemporary evidence, that of the Di&s;&s;enters them&s;elves. Before the commencement of the Civil War, it was one of their leading tenets, that the individuals of every con|gregation had, <HI>jure divino,</HI> a right to elect their own mini|&s;ter; but after they had begun the operation of ejecting the epi&s;copal Clergy, the A&s;&s;embly of Divines found it nece&s;&s;ary to give up the ?divine right of election:" at which time, Emanuel Knutton expre&s;&s;es his fervent gra|titude to our ble&s;&s;ed Parliament and reverend Synod," who took <Q>the care to &s;end zealous and godly mini&s;ters to</Q> vacant pari&s;hes. The nece&s;&s;ity of the conce&s;&s;ions of the A&s;&s;embly, and the joint care of that body and of the Parliament, is clearly &s;hewn by Needham, who tells us, that if the people had then been permitted to chu&s;e their own pa&s;tors, <Q>the godly and well-affected would have the lea&s;t &s;troak in the choice.</Q> And he adds, that <Q>if there be no other &s;upplies made for pari&s;hes but &s;uch as the <HI>pari&s;hioners cordially reverence and affect,</HI> the man to be cho&s;en in mo&s;t pari&s;hes would be, <HI>a man in a &s;urptice, with a common-prayer book, &amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Great Accu&s;er ca&s;t down, p. 40, 43.

<PB N="67" REF="72">we &s;ee that the Pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline was impo&s;ed upon the majority of a reluctant people, by a Party who had drawn them in to a&s;&s;ociate with them, by taking a &s;olemn <Q>Prote&s;tation, in the pre&s;ence of God, to maintain the religion expre&s;&s;ed in the doctrine of the Church of so England.</Q></P>

The only u&s;e &s;uch &s;tipulations &s;eem to have &s;erved is this: they enabled their projectors to acquire or retain the immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power; and by that power they compelled a reluctant people to follow, or to &s;ubmit to them in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive violations of their Compacts.</P>
<P>As the terms of the fir&s;t A&s;&s;ociation <Q>to maintain the true Prote&s;tant religion <HI>as expre&s;&s;ed in the doctrines of the Church of England,</HI></Q> were fulfilled by aboli&s;hing them by law, and by the introduction of the doctrines of the Church of Scotland, in&s;tead of them; &s;o the Solemn League and Covenant next entered into, profe&s;&s;ing in its preamble all regard to the honour and, happine&s;s of the King's Maje&s;ty and his po&s;terity, was fulfilled by tho&s;e, into &s;e hands the military and civil power of the League bad now fallen, by murdering him, and expelling his family out of the kingdom.

<P>THERE is but one &s;tep further to go in this account.

Many will think, perhaps, &s;uch atrocious plans were never agitated in Britain; the following well-authenticated anecdote, joined with the manner in which it is related, &s;hows this &s;uppo&s;ition not to be founded. It has been before noticed, that the father of Coke the hi&s;torian was a leading Member of the Long Parliament.

But this fact Coke pa&s;&s;es over without the lea&s;t observation of its being a tyrannical cruelty, either &s;ingular in it&s;elf, or even when joined with the con|&s;ideration of the rank and youth of the per&s;on: if it had been extra|ordinary in either of the&s;e re&s;pects, a Writer would have noted that circum&s;tance, when practi&s;ed upon his brother.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the hi&s;tory of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive French Revolu|tions &s;hall come to be carefully examined, it will be &s;up|po&s;ed very probable, that many of the wounds which, have been inflicted upon France, were made by daggers forged in this country. In the following ca&s;e &s;ome doubts may be entertained. The project to e&s;tabli&s;h a fingle National A&s;&s;embly, in&s;tead of two Hou&s;es, was attempted by the Commons before the Civil Wars, but they did not &s;ucceed in it. Foulis informs us, that the Commons <Q>had another mode to drive on their de&s;igns of altering the Government of England. They put &s;everal agitators to draw up a Petition, that the Peers who were agreeable to them would &s;it and vote with the Commons, to the intent to have but one
<PB N="71" REF="76">Hou&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Foulis Hi&s;t. of Plots, p. 82.</NOTE>.</Q> This Petition was accordingly framed, and by the Commons it was pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Lords. This might be the remote origin of the National A&s;&s;em|bly, or both the Engli&s;h Commons and the <HI>Tiers Etat</HI> in France might have poached for a precedent in the Memoirs of the Jacquerie.</P>
<P>THERE are de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;es, certainly, in the politi|cal as well as the natural con&s;titution, which require and may ju&s;tify very hazardous applications: but the&s;e are to be attempted only when it is evident that the ca&s;e will terminate fatally, before a cour&s;e of ameliorating alteratives can produce their effect. A vigorous remedy may al&s;o at one time be applied with little hazard; at another that hazard will be much increa&s;ed. We mu&s;t always endeavour to form a true e&s;timate of the <HI>alue in u&s;e</HI> of our object, &s;tripped carefully of tho&s;e gay ac|coutrements and tin&s;el with which imagination dre&s;&s;es out all its favourites. This value we are then to com|bine, with the probability of attaining our object, a&s;&s;ign|ed as truly as we can. This re&s;ult is, what a di&s;ciple of Simp&s;on or De Moivre would call, the expectation of gain from the experiment. We are then to view the real magnitude of the evils this object may draw after it; examining them with a mind equally clear from all pre|vention. This amount al&s;o is to be combined with the chance of their happening, to find the expectation of lo&s;s; the two expectations are to be balanced again&s;t each other, and we are to determine in favour of the greater, unle&s;s any evil may follow from the failure of the fir&s;t attempt. In that ca&s;e, having e&s;timated its mag|nitude
<PB N="72" REF="77">and chance, or what is above called its expectation, that expectation will be al&s;o a legitimate deduction from the former balance of gain, if any had been found.</P>
<P>To give an example of this proce&s;s:&mdash;In a Society like our own, let the &s;ucce&s;s of an a&s;&s;igned alteration in the State be extremely probable; the advantage very great: let there be a &s;mall chance that the progre&s;s of alteration will not &s;top at the acqui&s;ition intended, but that it may go on until a &s;tate of anarchy takes place; and let it be propo&s;ed to determine, whether this alter|ation is to be attempted. Here we mull rea&s;on thus: Anarchy is the arbitrary power of all over each indivi|dual; or the tyranny of all but one over every one. It is an evil in Society, like annihilation to the individual, infinite; and the chance of coming into this &s;tate being finite, though &s;mall, the expectation thereof, or the quantity of evil to be &s;et again&s;t the good, exceeds in magnitude any finite good which can be a&s;&s;igned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The de&s;poti&s;m of <HI>one</HI> over all, may undoubtedly be likewi&s;e denominated an infinite evil in Society; and no evil to ari&s;e from the hazard of life, <HI>in fair war,</HI> is equal to any individual's private &s;hare thereof. But mathematicians have made a di&s;tinction in the orders of infinites; they have their fir&s;t, their &s;econd, and higher orders. While the tyranny of a De&s;pot is of the fir&s;t or lower order, that of Anarchy re&s;embles the &s;econd. As I have borrowed their mode of argument hare, and they are the legi&s;lators of their own terms, they mu&s;t be u&s;ed. It might otherwi&s;e have been &s;aid, that the de&s;poti&s;m of an individual is an evil of an indefinite magnitude; &s;uppo&s;ing the Tyrant only to will, and his &s;atellites to be his pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments. Yet, in this ca&s;e, let there be 100,000 inhabitants in a State, each of them has the unlimited will of one only to apprehend; but let the Society be &s;tung into a &s;tate of anarchy, every man now will have 99,998 tyrants more.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="78">But to return to the hi&s;tory which led to this train of general reflection. The&s;e temperate men, who &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of a great amelioration of the &s;y&s;tem of exi&s;ting Government in 1640, in order to re&s;tore to the Legi&s;la|tive E&s;tates the actual exerci&s;e of their legal functions, though they had perhaps the mo&s;t efficient influence in impre&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t movement toward that end, found them&s;elves, from a concurrence of various cau&s;es, actu|ally not able to &s;top it, when it was gotten even beyond that point at which they wi&s;hed things to become &s;tation|ary. When the inclination of a plane exceeds a very &s;mall degree, a heavy body, to which the &s;lighte&s;t revo|lutionary movement is given, is urged along continually, as it moves, by an accelerating force, which &s;oon becomes indefinitely greater than that which was applied at fir&s;t to put it into motion; and nothing will &s;top it at the limit originally determined for its progre&s;s, but &s;ome firm ob&s;tacle placed before-hand, at that point of the line of its direction. And, in any tolerable &s;y&s;tem of Govern|ment, men ought to be ab&s;olutely certain that they &s;hall be able to &s;top at &s;uch an a&s;&s;igned point, before any alteration be attempted. If mo e than a little be required to be done, the work &s;hould be &s;ubdivided, and under|taken at intervals; the fir&s;t &s;tep in the progre&s;s may be &s;o taken as to en&s;ure &s;ome little facilities to the &s;econd, but not to precipitate it. To u&s;e for a moment out pre|&s;ent political neologi&s;m, the Parliament in 1640 accele|rated that revolutionary movement which they ought to have re&s;trained; the ferment of the people, which ori|ginally perhaps required tempering, was increa&s;ed by eve|ry art. They greedily acquired a power too great for the weight to be removed; and they were not ma&s;ters of its effects. When a quantity of ma&s;onry wants to be
<PB N="74" REF="79">picked out of the fabric of any Con&s;titution, in order to have the place &s;upplied with better materials, a batter|ing ram is rather too potent an in&s;trument to be u&s;ed to effect the removal: it will &s;hake the edifice, and may reduce it to a heap of formle&s;s ruin. The old materials mu&s;t be removed with care, and the parts left un&s;upport|ed mu&s;t be carefully propped until the vacancy be filled up.</P>
<P>THE Members of the Commons who &s;at at Oxford, and who voted under compul&s;ion at We&s;tmin&s;ter, may be looked upon, when contradi&s;tingui&s;hed to the remainder, as one party in &s;entiment, and as forming an undoubted majority of the original A&s;&s;embly. Hence even if every one of them had voted freely in the places where they &s;at and upon the &s;ame que&s;tion, that majority had lo&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of expre&s;&s;ing a legal will. But the Legi|&s;lative A&s;&s;embly in France, in the la&s;t period of its exi&s;|tence, had been, by their own fanatici&s;m, and the crimes it gave birth to, forced to work in chains to demoli&s;h that edifice, that glory of philo&s;ophy! that pride of en|lightened Europe! the fir&s;t Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE ruin brought upon Britain by the Leaders of the&s;e A&s;&s;ociations paying no regard to their limits, was almo&s;t extreme. The ob&s;ervations on the hazards this country has run from Offen&s;ive A&s;&s;ociations, in other in&s;tances, have, in this Tract, always been followed by an inquiry, whe|ther there was anything in the manners and character of the people, previous to tho&s;e &s;everal calamities, which had a more alarming appearance of danger than can be ob|&s;erved at pre&s;ent: and I &s;hall clo&s;e this Section with an inquiry, whether, before the Civil Wars, from the cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="75" REF="80">of the times and the moral character of the people, any more threatening appearances might have been di&s;cerned, of a Revolution de&s;troying the Con&s;ti|tution, and terminating almo&s;t in the de&s;poti&s;m of Anar|chy, than have been of late years and are at pre&s;ent, plainly &s;een among us.</P>
<P>IN both periods we &s;ee Revolutions de&s;tructive to the Con&s;titution, attempted under the pretence of a reform, (the nece&s;&s;ity of which exi&s;ts not in one ca&s;e, and had cea&s;ed in the other by exciting fanatici&s;m, religious or political. We have &s;een either &s;pecies, &s;eparately, capa|ble of producing the &s;ame effects upon the populace; that is, to bring all their ferocious pa&s;&s;ions into action: con&s;equently, if they be &s;timulated by a mixture of both, as was the ca&s;e in the la&s;t Century, it cannot produce a greater effect than either of them &s;imply; as, for in&s;tance, political fanatici&s;m; as each, &s;eparately, will occupy the active powers of the whole mind, and both together can do no more.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider next the real or &s;uppo&s;ed grievances of the two periods.&mdash;Such grievances mu&s;t be, either violations of right, or privations of gratification by State charges, or mixed. By the Agitators of the la&s;t Century, it was im|pre&s;&s;ed on the minds of the populace, that many of their legal rights were violated: and, as it always happens in &s;uch times, they equally believed what was truly and what was fal&s;ely alledged on this &s;ubject. Stronger repre&s;enta|tions are now made, and a more exten&s;ive circulation given them. The great majority of the populace are taught that they are, defrauded, not only of many of their legal rights
<PB N="76" REF="81">as &s;ubjects, but of a great ma&s;s of their natural rights as men; and they give the &s;ame implicit belief to their de|magogues now, as their ance&s;tors did in the la&s;t Century; and the great amount of the taxes at pre&s;ent, is as favour|able a &s;ubject for inflammatory declamation, as the ille|gality of their impo&s;ition was then.</P>
<P>LET us now enter into a compari&s;on of the qualifica|tions of the Agitators of the two periods for their re|&s;pective ta&s;ks. The operations of tho&s;e of the la&s;t age re&s;embled the attacks of an undi&s;ciplined multitude, com|paratively without order or concert. Their mode of ac|tion is now reduced into a &s;cience; and they are can|toned over the whole country, the chiefs of a ho&s;tile State within a State, formed into the exacte&s;t di&s;cipline, under an active Directory, which knows how to di&s;tri|bute its force, and apply its operations to every point of attack and defence where they &s;hall become nece&s;&s;ary. They are an army actuated by a &s;ingle will and a &s;ingle intelligence, which has di&s;covered a new and profound &s;y&s;tem of tactics.</P>
<P>HAVING thus balanced their abilities for action, we may pa&s;s to the review of the materials one of the&s;e Catilinarian bands of con&s;pirators had, and the other has now, to act upon. It will be &s;aid, that <Q>men have at this day before them the dreadful example of the infringement of the engagements of limitation, by which the Parliament of Charles bound them&s;elves and the people.</Q> But to this it will be replied, that there never was a time in which the crime that followed them, had &s;o many and &s;uch determined advocates, at lea&s;t in the lower cla&s;&s;es of the demagogues, nor in which
<PB N="77" REF="82">they were heard by the multitude with &s;uch partial atten|tion. Nor, though we call this an enlightened age, are men enlightened by &s;imply exchanging one &s;et of prin|ciples for another; the mind is not enlightened with re&s;pect to any object, which it formerly con&s;idered ex|clu&s;ively in one point of view, if it now comes to &s;urvey it exclu&s;ively in a &s;econd.</P>
<P>BUT let it be admitted, that the populace may po&s;&s;e&s;s a more exerci&s;ed keenne&s;s of mind on political points now, than in the middle of the la&s;t Century; unle&s;s it can be &s;hown that their morals are not wor&s;e, that they are not more addicted to rapine, that they have not le&s;s reve|rence for laws, as &s;uch, or if the contrary of all this ap|pears a melancholy truth, with what advantage can an increa&s;e of &s;uch knowledge be pleaded, when the que&s;|tion is, Can we put more faith in articles contained in their Covenants or A&s;&s;ociations at this juncture, than were due to the &s;tipulations of their ance&s;tors?&mdash;which repeated experiments proved to be intitled to none. It is an acknowledged fact, with re&s;pect to every individual, that if as his rea&s;on grows more acute, his principles grow wor&s;e, his fidelity will not be improved: his cha|racter will even become more dangerous, and that in a degree determined by the &s;um of tho&s;e two changes: and the &s;ame mu&s;t be true of a multitude compo&s;ed of &s;uch individuals.</P>
<P>IF &s;ome increa&s;e of their knowledge be to be admitted, the degeneracy of the morals of the populace is capable of fuller proof. Will any one contend that the annual number of convictions of criminals does not increa&s;e
<PB N="78" REF="83">with much greater celerity than our population?

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. CONCLUSION. FURTHER REMARKS ON MR. FOX'S ASSOCIATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t part of this Tract begins with a compari&s;on of the nature of the A&s;&s;ociations of 1792, and the Gene|ral A&s;&s;ociation of the People under Mr. Fox. There remained many particular ob&s;ervations to make on the latter; but the principles on which I intended to found &s;ome of them, are &s;uch as will be received with greater authority when demon&s;trated by induction from Hi&s;tory, than if they had been &s;imply proved by ab&s;tract rea&s;on|ing.
<PB N="80" REF="85">A further u&s;e al&s;o appeared to me to ari&s;e from this way of managing the &s;ubject: it has enabled me to point out the &s;imilarity of the &s;pirit of all commotions, excited by Offen&s;ive A&s;&s;ociations again&s;t an exi&s;ting Government, not de&s;potic; and more particularly of tho&s;e where a Sec|tion of the A&s;&s;ociators originally &s;ets out with democratic principles, or takes them up in the cour&s;e of their pro|gre&s;s. In this manner of treating the remainder of the &s;ubject, there will he &s;ome recapitulations; but they will be given with as much brevity as it will permit.</P>
<P>THE A&s;&s;ociations of 1792 may be compared to a clu&s;ter of about two thou&s;and Republics, independent, or at mo&s;t &s;lightly connected by the laxe&s;t principle of fede|rali&s;m: their object was Defen&s;ive. From the hi&s;tory of &s;uch A&s;&s;ociations in this country, it appears that they alone have been u&s;eful in the &s;upport of the con&s;titution of Government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is admitted, that the Con&s;titution has been gradually ame|liorated; bits it may be made a que&s;tion upon this admi&s;&s;ion, how the&s;e ameliorations have been obtained? The cour&s;e has generally been, that Kings, at different times, have granted beneficial laws and franchi&s;es to the people; &s;ometimes &s;pontaneou&s;ly, as that great founder of the Engli&s;h Juri&s;prudence, Edward the Fir&s;t; &s;ometimes to attach the people to their titles when doubtful&mdash;thus Henry the Fir&s;t granted a Charter, rather more full than Magna Charta, and the origin of it; and at other times by a tacit or more expre&s;s con|tract for a large &s;upply, as the Petition of Rights. The enjoyment of the&s;e franchi&s;es, in act and effect, has been, at different times, &s;ecured by Defen&s;ive A&s;&s;ociations. It is the felicity of this king|dom that they were &s;o obtained; but it is not meant at a proof that all other modes of obtaining them are criminal.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="86">THE A&s;&s;ociation of Mr. Fox is in its object l Offen&s;ive; and it has been &s;een that all &s;uch of which a &s;urvey has been taken above, have been attended with very fatal con&s;equences: and if the plan of this can be carried into execution completely or nearly &s;o, it will become a ma|chine capable of de&s;troying any Government: the general body of the people being invited to become par|ties thereto, and generally &s;o becoming, its force will be effectively the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible: to this it adds the &s;tronge&s;t degree of union, while it has a Directory at its head, the Whig Club, which is to be regarded as under the con|duct of an effective Dictator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>A Declaration of the motives of the Club in recom|mending this A&s;&s;ociation, was read by Mr. Mackinto&s;h, and unanimou&s;ly approved of.</Q> (Introduction, p. 3.) The emi|nence of Mr. M. among our Political Writers, impre&s;&s;es me &s;trongly with the belief that he was the Author of the Declaration which he read: his public act however proves it could contain nothing re|pugnant to his avowed political principles. As I have not his book, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe &s;ome part of what Dr. Parr has &s;aid of his wri|tings: &mdash; <Q>In Mackinto&s;h I &s;ee the &s;ternne&s;s of a Republican with|out his acrimony:</Q> but this may probably de&s;cribe only the cha|racter of his &s;entiments on abu&s;es of power. The Doctor pronoun|ces an "unqualified negative" on his opinion that <Q>the exi&s;tence of ranks is repugnant to the &s;ocial union:</Q> from this we know what he mu&s;t think of an Hereditary Senate, or Hou&s;e of Lords, in a State. And in the conclu&s;ion of his critique on his work, Dr. Parr lays down a further capital point of difference between him&s;elf and Mr. M. in the&s;e words:&mdash; <Q>I prefer two independent Hou&s;es, for legi&s;lative deliberation, to one; and that in a King with the &s;ub&s;tance of the executive power, will be found a better guar|dian of the public weal, than in the mockery of a pageant King with little more than the &s;hadow.</Q> The&s;e extract will not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be an inimical account of Mr. Mackinto&s;h's Principles of Government; as Dr. Parr, in a note, applies to him what Cicero &s;aid of Horten&s;ius-Quinti Horten&s;ii admodum adole&s;centis inge|nium, ut Phidiae &s;ignum, &s;imul ad&s;pectum et probatum e&s;t.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="87">Now let it be &s;uppo&s;ed that a man of great ambition, yet that ambition purified from all meanne&s;s, whole plain manners are con&s;ummately attaching yet manly, as if his object were power over all men collectively, not in|dividually, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an eloquence ma&s;culine, pure, and commanding, is &s;et at the head of &s;uch an omni|potent A&s;&s;ociation: admit him al&s;o to be a man of dex|trous and profound ability, fertile in expedients, rapid in the execution of his plans; and that the citadel of Government in his native country has a con&s;iderable &s;trength for re&s;i&s;tance, but is by no means an impregna|ble fortre&s;s; generally &s;urrendering (but by capitulation) after a longer or a &s;horter &s;iege: and that, in the chec|quered fortunes of his political life, he has twice made his way into it by &s;omething like a <HI>coup de main;</HI> and that he has been &s;aid, the la&s;t time, to have begun to &s;trengthen this fortre&s;s, as &s;oon as he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, with additional works, con&s;tructed on a new &s;y&s;tem of fortification, &s;o far improved as to bid defiance to any regular mode of attack yet di&s;covered:&mdash;in dange|rous times, if &s;uch a man mi&s;-allied him&s;elf he mu&s;t be highly dangerous.</P>
<P>THE qualities by which he has attained power have been indicated; and, mixing in his councils, when in place, &s;omewhat too much of the qualities by which he obtained it, let him be &s;uppo&s;ed, each time, &s;uddenly to have fallen; and now well pa&s;t the meridian of life&punc; but again entertaining &s;ome fair hopes, by the aid of the band of friends whom he &s;aw about him, eminent in ability, and with high national re&s;pect attached to their names, at la&s;t to obtain what had been the object of the labours of his youth and of his manhood to the verge of age:
<PB N="83" REF="88">to &s;ee this removed out of his reach by any common means, by the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of the great body of his party, with every name of higher ornament to it at their head, from the danger they ultimately di&s;cern in the cour&s;e he has been of late years pur&s;uing, as having been unduly qualified to the nature of a mixed Government; we might well dread, from the pall experience of his poli|tical enterprize, that if he openly put him&s;elf at the head of &s;uch an A&s;&s;ociation as I have been de&s;cribing (thereby pointing out his de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s by every other re&s;ource) that he might not be unwilling to re|acquire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his object by uncommon means.</P>
<P>AND if, at &s;uch a time, there exi&s;t a Republican Fac|tion in the State, or a Party that &s;hould contend for a mixed Government, with a pageant of a King and a &s;ingle Elective Chamber (which, infallibly terminating in the former, is for the pre&s;ent to be regarded as the &s;ame thing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The stability of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, compared with that of the Eng|li&s;h Con&s;titution, has been very well illu&s;trated by that of is <Q>a two footed &s;tool</Q> and a "tripod."

<PB N="84" REF="89">in their &s;y&s;tems; and the apprehen&s;ion of it to the &s;up|porters of the pre&s;ent form of Government.

And mu&s;t he not appear, at the head of &s;uch an A&s;&s;ociation, dangerous in the extreme?</P>
<P>I NOW take leave of this hypothetical per&s;onage and come to a real one. But I mu&s;t here premi&s;e an abridged account of the original plan and object of the Jacobin Club from Dr. Moore; as it will be expedient to enter into a compari&s;on between the&s;e and a principle laid down in the Hou&s;e of Commons in 1781.</P>
<P>IN 1789 a &s;mall number of Deputies &s;ent from Brittany to the States General of France, a&s;&s;ociated under the name of the Committee of that province. Being afterwards joined by &s;ome other members of that A&s;&s;embly, and per|&s;ons attached to liberty, they a&s;&s;umed new titles, copying the &s;tyle of &s;ome Engli&s;h Societies; taking fir&s;t the name of The Revolution Club, and ultimately that of Friends of the Con&s;titution. From the place of their a&s;&s;embling, they received from the Public the name of JACOBINS; under which they have &s;ince become &s;o fatally di&s;tin|gui&s;hed. In this Society, at fir&s;t, there were many per&s;ons celebrated for their talents and character. Clubs of the &s;ame nature were multiplied over all France, who regularly cor|re&s;ponded with them; and who, finding a central body ready formed, through which they might tran&s;mit their opinions and wi&s;hes to the National A&s;&s;embly, they ap|pointed
<PB N="85" REF="90">them their agents for this purpo&s;e; and as the Club had, at the beginning, a&s;&s;umed the functions of the Delegates of tho&s;e in who&s;e behalf they held them&s;elves forth as acting, they were by other Provincial Clubs ac|knowledged in that capacity: and the irregularity of the a&s;&s;umption was thus to appearance done away. It is to be ob&s;erved, that when this &s;y&s;tem was completely organized, and their extra-con&s;titutional functions thus confirmed, the Club differed from the Meeting of the Delegates of the County A&s;&s;ociations, who &s;at in Lon|don in 1781, in one circum&s;tance only. The objects the latter were to treat on were &s;pecified; con&s;equently their delegation would have terminated when the&s;e ends were obtained: tho&s;e of the former were unlimited, the continuance of their functions not being dependent on their obtaining any &s;pecific object or objects.</P>
<P>"THE avowed bu&s;ine&s;s of the Society" (of Jacobins) <Q>was to deliberate and debate on &s;ubjects of Govern|ment, and watch over the general intere&s;ts of Liber|ty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Moores Journ. &amp; 1793, v. I. p. 110, 111.</NOTE>.</Q> Now in a Government where everything de|pends in effect on the deci&s;ions of the Repre&s;entative, this amounts to <HI>watching over its conduct</HI> without limitation of time<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>It is evident &s;uch a &s;uperintendence, wherever e&s;tabli&s;hed, mu&s;t grow up into &s;ub&s;tantial cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oul on Government in general: the &s;ame power mu&s;t produce the &s;ome effects in every country: even at lea&s;t a Perpetual A&s;&s;embly of Delegates would have de&s;troyed the Con&s;titution, by con&s;tituting an effective Fourth E&s;tate of Par|liament.</P></NOTE>, and to no more: and if the object of the
<PB N="86" REF="91">Delegates in 1781 had been &s;o exten&s;ive in that meeting, England would have exhibited the fir&s;t example of a Jaco|bin Society.</P>
<P>BUT it is to the full; extent of that object that the principle goes, which is laid down in the following ex|tract of a &s;peech attributed to Mr. Fox. It is to be found in the Hi&s;tory of our Parliamentary Tran&s;actions, printed in The New Annual Regi&s;ter in 1781, the wri|ter of which appears &s;trongly attached to his intere&s;ts. <Q>By what law or what act (that State&s;man is made to &s;ay) was it declared to be uncon&s;titutional for the people of this country to appoint Delegates to re&s;ide in the metropolis, and <HI>to watch the conduct of their Repre&s;en|tatives</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Briti&s;h and Foreign Hi&s;t. p. 133.</NOTE>?</Q> Such interrogations carry the full force of affirmations.</P>
<P>IF tho&s;e who gave to the original Breton Committee its la&s;t Con&s;titution, whereby it was transformed into a Jacobin Club, did not look for its avowed principle in the doctrine here laid down, yet, if they had, they mu&s;t have found it. In defining the functions of that Club, the Legi&s;lators who gave to it its mo&s;t fini&s;hed code, have almo&s;t copied the expre&s;&s;ions here attributed to Mr. Fox; for if there be any difference between <Q>watching over the general intere&s;ts of liberty,</Q> and <Q>watching over the conduct of our Repre&s;entatives,</Q> as the latter in|cludes their whole conduct in all its branches, it &s;eems the more comprehensive, if we do not take the words
<PB N="87" REF="92">preceding the fir&s;t citation (as formerly quoted) in aid thereof: and it would be very difficult to &s;how the fatal In&s;titution of the Jacobins not to have been derived from the principle laid down in this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>IF the above declaration a&s;cribed to Mr. Fox contain his real pre&s;ent &s;entiments, and we combine this with his putting him&s;elf at the head of an A&s;&s;ociation of the Re|publicans, real and virtual, the qualities of which will be neither mitigated or modified by &s;ome mi&s;guided men of better principles and little fore&s;ight joining in it, it is a &s;tep big with danger to the exi&s;ting Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>BUT I have done with the &s;ubject in this point of view, and make no doubt that there are many, even among his old opponents, who regret that he did not join the illu&s;|trious body of his late political friends in their &s;ece&s;&s;ion from the remnant which continues to call it&s;elf The Whig Club; who think there is a part remaining for him to act at lea&s;t equal in dignity and &s;plendor to any that he has yet acted in; who&s;e wi&s;hes continue to be, that, forgetting &s;ome of tho&s;e extremes of opinion which made "him pu&s;h his better Angel from his &s;ide," he would in part follow tho&s;e &s;eceders: they would rejoice to &s;ee him (without that appearance of intire tran&s;ition which, &s;ometimes rightly &s;ometimes wrongly, has de|&s;troyed the reputation of great rulers of Parties), for a time avowedly unconnected and alone, a Party by him|&s;elf, a&s;&s;uming that function within, which can belong to no exclu&s;ive and organi&s;ed body of men without the
<PB N="88" REF="93">walls of the Hou&s;e; <Q>to watch over the conduct of our Repre&s;entatives.</Q></P>
<P>LET us now examine the mode by which the object of this A&s;&s;ociation is to be obtained; thereby <Q>the &s;ub|&s;cribers pledge them&s;elves only to pro&s;ecute a &s;ole ob|ject by every legal and peaceable means.</Q> This implies the ab&s;ence of all force, apparent or latent, in the pro&s;e|cution of it.</P>
<P>AND &s;uppo&s;e, on this occa&s;ion, the authors of this plan to be able to carry it into effect, or procure a Ge|neral A&s;&s;ociation of the People, is not the union of the People irre&s;i&s;tible? As &s;uch, Will it excite no appre|hen&s;ion in the Legi&s;lature? The terror of an irre&s;i&s;tible petitioner is not among the means to obtain a repeal of a law which are to be called peaceable. It is not the Legi&s;lation of the land, but the law of the &s;tronger, the <HI>jus fortioris,</HI> which decides, in effect, upon the merits of &s;uch a petition. But it is only what takes place by the will of the Legi&s;lature, acting in total freedom, which is either legally or peaceably obtained. The act of appeal to the <HI>jus fortioris,</HI> formally made, or &s;ufficiently indi|cated by preparation, though denied in words, &s;ets a&s;ide the Law and Legi&s;lation of the Land; and what is ob|tained thereby never can be, according to that, legal; for the Law &s;anctions nothing while it is in a &s;tate of non|exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>WE know that a Society has the right of &s;elf-preserva|tion as well as an individual; and that there are ca&s;es of extreme nece&s;&s;ity, when the action of the whole peo|ple
<PB N="89" REF="94">may be called forth. But it is to be ob&s;erved, that it never can be brought forward peaceably; it mu&s;t operate by force or by terror: &s;uch a mea&s;ure is in effect re&s;i&s;t|ance at lea&s;t; it even amounts to compul&s;ion, whether avowed as &s;uch or not, which is &s;omething more.</P>
<P>I TAKE it for granted the nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be as great and as obvious when the whole People are to he united again&s;t the three con&s;tituent parts of the Legi&s;lature, as when that union is directed only again&s;t one; again&s;t an act or acts of the King. Lords, and Commons, as again&s;t an act or acts of the King alone. The circum&s;tan|ces under which the latter mea&s;ure is con&s;titutional have been laid down by Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyl; <Q>the very &s;tandard of Whig principles of his age;</Q> and on the occa&s;ion when they were to be defined with the utmo&s;t accuracy, in order that the maxims on which the great pre&s;ervers of the Con&s;titution in 1688 acted, &s;hould be left upon record to all po&s;terity. This he did at the Trial of Dr. Sacheverel, when, &s;peaking in the name of the Managers for the Commons, he defines two great conditions, under which re&s;i&s;tance to the Crown becomes ju&s;tifiable. The&s;e &s;hall be compared with the pre&s;ent ca&s;e:&mdash;1&s;t. <Q>We have in&s;i&s;ted, that in no ca&s;e can re&s;i&s;tance be lawful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Lawful <HI>(i e.) in &s;oro con&s;cientiae;</HI> recognize the right of re&s;i&s;tance in expre&s;s terms; as the Managers for the Commons &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted. Indeed, that a ca&s;e &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law, in which Law is to have no force, is a contra|diction in terms.</P></NOTE> but in ca&s;e of extreme nece&s;&s;ity, and where the Con&s;titu|tion cannot otherwi&s;e be pre&s;erved:</Q> 2d. <Q>And &s;uch nece&s;&s;ty ought to be plain and obvious to the &s;en&s;e and
<PB N="90" REF="95">judgement of the whole Nation:</Q> and this every good &s;ubject who knows the hi&s;tory of the times, believes with him to have been "the ca&s;e at the Revolution." The act of the whole Legi&s;lature ought not to be oppo&s;ed by the union of the whole People upon &s;lighter grounds. I would therefore a&s;k the promoters of this A&s;&s;ociation, How they can prove the extreme nece&s;&s;ity that men &s;hould continue liable to be tried and condemned for trea|&s;on, on proceedings analogous to the principles <Q>of an <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, v. 3. p. 25. note, and Appendix, No. I.</NOTE>?</Q> that the beacons which now more plainly point out legal danger to the factious &s;hould be removed? and they &s;hould be left, at their own extreme hazard and with &s;ome danger to the Public, to the chance of running upon a rock, not le&s;s fatal for being &s;unk almo&s;t out of &s;ight? For the object of the A&s;&s;ocia|tion is to re&s;tore them to this &s;ituation, out of which the two Bills have taken them.</P>
<P>BUT let it be granted, that the proof of the extreme nece&s;&s;ity of this re&s;toration is by them made out in full form; &s;till that nece&s;&s;ity wants the &s;econd e&s;&s;ential pro|perty, for them to be intitled to act upon it: it is not, as it <Q>ought to be, plain and obvious to the &s;en&s;e and judgement of the whole Nation.</Q> It is certain that the great majority of that cla&s;s, who by their &s;ituation are able to acquire, and who actually do po&s;&s;e&s;s, by far the greater portion of political and con&s;titutional &s;cience, the greater weight of the whole ma&s;s of the political knowledge of the State, deny the exi&s;tence of the nece&s;|&s;ity; they even affirm the nece&s;&s;ity of the exi&s;tence of the Acts thus oppo&s;ed, as appears by their Addre&s;&s;es
<PB N="91" REF="96">to the Throne, and their Petitions to the late Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>IN this relative unanimity of the whole Legi&s;lature in &s;upport of the two Acts, &s;upported it&s;elf by almo&s;t the <HI>bo|norum omnium con&s;en&s;us,</HI> the con&s;ent of all good Engli&s;hmen, notwith&s;tanding all the profe&s;&s;ions that can be made of u&s;ing none but legal and peaceable means to obtain the repeal of them, what confidence can the A&s;&s;ociations en|tertain of &s;ucce&s;s, except from power, or the apprehen|&s;ion of power? The very act of a&s;&s;ociation adds no argument to the repeal; and I am certain the names of the Club which brought it forward, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate does not add to that authority. The mea&s;ure is a tacit menace to the Legi&s;lature, by no means a peaceable mode to carry through a petition; and, if not contrary to the letter of the Laws of England, contrary to the univer|&s;al &s;pirit of Law. Bacon, in his Hi&s;torical Di&s;cour&s;es, &s;ays, that <Q>when the written law maketh it trea&s;on to compa&s;s the de&s;truction of the King's per&s;on, it leav|eth it obvious to common; &s;en&s;e that it is a higher de|gree of trea&s;on to compa&s;s the de&s;truction of the Re|pre&s;entative<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Continuation, p. 77.1651.</NOTE></Q> And by the &s;ame mode of argument it may be &s;hown, that the coercion of the King by effect|ive menace in the exerci&s;e of his Royal functions, being a high crime and mi&s;demeanor; the coercion of the Legi|&s;lature, by &s;imilar means, is of the &s;ame criminality; and &s;urely &s;uch a coercion of the Commons, according to the principles of the&s;e men, is a wound of the maje&s;ty of the People, which re&s;ides in them; and <Q>all men do

<P>THE Heads of &s;uch an A&s;&s;ociation would not commit them&s;elves in &s;uch a mea&s;ure without &s;trong hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, again&s;t the almo&s;t unanimous oppo&s;ition of the informed cla&s;&s;es of Society at large, and the union of all the con&s;tituent parts of the Legi&s;lature. On what can they found that hope? They mu&s;t expect aid from &s;ome other quarter; external aid, but which they can cau&s;e to operate in the very walls of both Hou&s;es, to awe them and the &s;upporters of the Bills into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The horizon at lea&s;t mu&s;t be involved in darkne&s;s, the &s;ullen &s;ound of di&s;tant thunders mu&s;t be heard from many quarters, it the &s;pirit that rai&s;ed the &s;torm do not roll its strength over their heads, and let all its rage de&s;cend upon them. If the&s;e leaders of the people do not em|ploy actual tumults and commotions to force a reluctant Parliament into their mea&s;ures, they mu&s;t &s;uffer them to be inforced by the fear of their near approach, or they are embarked in the mo&s;t ridiculous of all undertakings, as it mu&s;t he the mo&s;t fatal to every future rational view of coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto power, which they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to entertain.</P>
<P>LET us grant now that the Heads of the A&s;&s;ociation are mo&s;t &s;trictly determined to confine them&s;elves to the re&s;pectful conduct of real petitioners; that they will &s;ubmit to repul&s;e after repul&s;e without exceeding its bounds the certain fate of their application to Parliament
<PB N="93" REF="98">without the apprehen&s;ion of latent or appare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> force: I &s;ay their be&s;t intentions, reali&s;ed in irreproach|able conduct, will probably add very little to the pro|tection of the State, from the extreme of danger hang|ing over it from this A&s;&s;ociation, if the project take place.</P>
<P>FOR their repeated efforts alone will generate a ferment in the minds of the populace; and can they an&s;wer that the lower cla&s;&s;es of the a&s;&s;ociators will not take up ei|ther <HI>their</HI> object or <HI>&s;ome other,</HI> re-involve the metropolis in the di&s;orders of: 1780, and expo&s;e the whole kingdom to them? In that year, when the multitude had &s;een the counties holding meetings to cen&s;ure the internal ad|mini&s;tration of the kingdom; forming Committees of Corre&s;pondence, &s;ending Delegates to &s;it in Congre&s;s or Convention, in the metropolis: at that period, as it had been &s;aid above, an individual of a doubtful de&s;cription, between an enthu&s;ia&s;t and a madman, availed him&s;elf of the agitated &s;tate of their minds to direct them to an end with a new name; and they, mixing ferocity and the de|&s;ire of plunder, with certainly a very weak degree of re|ligious fanatici&s;m, had nearly effected the ruin of the capital. Yet at this in&s;tant there is a greater real fer|ment in the minds of the lower cla&s;&s;es, than Lord George Gordon was able to excite; nor, if the Chiefs of the A&s;&s;o|ciation be now as aver&s;e to lead then into &s;imilar exce&s;&s;es as it is here &s;uppo&s;ed, will they want many really for|midable enthu&s;ia&s;tic leaders to hurry them forward.</P>
<P>NOR can the &s;eat of Government at this juncture, nor the kingdom in general, expect le&s;s mi&s;ery from &s;uch a
<PB N="94" REF="99">commotion, if not in&s;tantly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, than the afflicted territory of France has recently &s;uffered. In an in&s;ur|rection of the Engli&s;h populace, political fanatici&s;m and the eagerne&s;s of plunder will jointly &s;timulate them, even at fir&s;t; but the deva&s;tations of France, for a long time, were cau&s;ed by that fanatici&s;m alone: the &s;pirit of plun|der was not mixed with it. Even &s;o late as the time when he palace of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uilleries was &s;tormed, the very a&s;&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ins killed on the &s;pot &s;everal men <Q>who on that day at|tempted to &s;teal the plate.</Q> <Q>It mu&s;t appear (&s;ays Dr. Moore) in a peculiar manner &s;trange to per&s;ons ac|cu&s;tomed to live in a country where there are fre|quent robberies and burglaries, in &s;pite of the Govern|ment being undi&s;turbed and the Laws in full force, <HI>to find none,</HI> where all the hinges and &s;upports of Law and Government are loo&s;e and &s;haking from a recent convul&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journ. v. 1. p. 119.

This conclu&s;ion is, fully confirmed by an authority which will be very unexpected to many, that of Mr. Barlow, in his Advice to the Privileged Orders; who informs us, that <Q>the Mobs in France were by no means to be compared with Engli&s;h Mobs in point of indi&s;criminate ferocity and private plunder<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 8.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>UNITE the populace by an A&s;&s;ociation, exhibit to them an object to acquire, and, if there be the lea&s;t delay
<PB N="95" REF="100">in its acqui&s;ition, they will ru&s;h forward upon the &s;cene of action. Little is the di&s;tance with them, between the point of time when they &s;hall be thus combined and sti|mulated, and when they break forth in outrage; for &s;ooner than &s;tand &s;till, they will make rapid vibrations in the mo&s;t contrary directions; moving with impetuo&s;ity to|ward one point, and returning with the &s;ame impetuo&s;ity to that from which they &s;at out. In the &s;horte&s;t &s;pace of time before James fled to Fever&s;ham, the &s;overeign po|pulace of London had, without doubt, pronounced his <HI>decheance:</HI> but although by that flight he had attempted to annihilate civil government in this country, upon his return, he was received by them with every mark of, the mo&s;t zealous affection. <Q>This great turn in the minds of the city<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Occa&s;ional Sermons, preface, p. 20.</NOTE></Q> continued during his re&s;idence at Ro|che&s;ter, or until the 23d of December. Having proceeded to the extreme in that direction of movement, and un|able to continue &s;tationary, we have &s;een, that &s;o early as the 4th of the month of February, they announced a &s;e|cond change of their will by an in&s;urrection, to compel the Convention to declare his throne vacant.</P>
<P>HENCE it may be rea&s;onably predicted, that if the pro|jectors of this A&s;&s;ociation be able to embody the popu|lace nominally under them, the latter will not wait for orders to come into action. The de&s;ire to copy the ex|ample of the populace of France prevails among many; and by their being drawn more together by this dangerous mea&s;ure, it will be more generally diffu&s;ed. And Hi&s;tory informs us, that the &s;pirit of in&s;urrection has mo&s;tly mi|grated from France to England. The religious A&s;&s;ocia|tion or League under the Gui&s;es, was the precedent of
<PB N="96" REF="101">the Pre&s;byterian Solemn League and Covenant; and the A&s;&s;ociation of the Jacquerie, on the principle of the equal Rights of Men, was copied in England by Wat Tyler and his a&s;&s;ociates. The eruption of both the&s;e evils was kept back here for a con&s;iderable period; and if either of the&s;e events excited any alarm in England when they fir&s;t took place, the pa&s;&s;ing of five or &s;ix, or even ten or twelve years, without their producing any effect, was no proof that &s;uch alarm was not founded on real danger; and it will be happy for this country, this generation, and po&s;terity, if the &s;y&s;tem of the Jacobins, (the way of which &s;eems now preparing by A&s;&s;ociations tendered to the populace) be kept permanently at a di&s;tance from us.</P>
<P>BUT let us pa&s;s from this inve&s;tigation of the probabi|lity of the peaceable legality of the <HI>intended</HI> good conduct of this A&s;&s;ociation; which, if it be not meant to over|awe Parliament, is a great movement without a motive, and a prodigal wa&s;te of the la&s;t chance of the man who guides it, of &s;tanding again at the head of a great and regular Party; let us pa&s;s from this to the declaration of the limitation of its object, and con&s;ider the &s;ecurity ari&s;ing from the engagement, that the A&s;&s;ociation will confine its operations to the &s;ingle object announced. This &s;ecurity mu&s;t be determined, from the de&s;cription of the parties to the contract, and the matter thereof con|jointly.</P>
<P>THE whole Party of the avowed Republicans will be included among the &s;ub&s;cribers; all of them the defen|ders, and almo&s;t all of them the admirers of the viola|tors and violation of the &s;olemn engagement to the &s;up|port of Monarchy, taken by the French A&s;&s;embly in July
<PB N="97" REF="102">1792, and broken the 10th of the following Augu&s;t. What they defend, and what they admire, they will not be very backward in copying. Together with the&s;e, the party will con&s;i&s;t of men of &s;ome other de&s;criptions: of tho&s;e nominally profe&s;&s;ing to wi&s;h for a King, and a &s;ingle A&s;&s;embly of Repre&s;entatives, in order to introduce a Republic by &s;tealth, and tho&s;e who wi&s;h for &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem in reality; the latter of which coming to act in a clo&s;er union with the two former &s;ections of the A&s;|&s;ociation, will be ea&s;ily won over to their party; for the mo&s;t decided opinions have always the loude&s;t advocates: and, indeed, we can hardly di&s;cover on what ground they can hold out again&s;t the arguments with which the&s;e allies of theirs will be able to a&s;&s;ail them; on the folly of a &s;y&s;tem who&s;e only con&s;equence mu&s;t apparently be, to prolong, during a &s;ad and bloody interval, the la&s;t con|vul&s;ions and dying &s;truggle of Monarchy. The remain|der of the A&s;&s;ociation will be compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who wi&s;h for what they call a Reform of the Commons, or &s;ome other Reform, and at every hazard of the State; for the more temperate advocates of the&s;e mea&s;ures will not join the A&s;&s;ociation. Tho&s;e who were content with our &s;y&s;tem of laws before the pa&s;&s;ing of the two Acts, who will join in this compact, will be very few indeed: al|mo&s;t the whole of them having concurred in declar|ing their opinion, that the temporary regulations in|troduced by the&s;e laws, is at this time nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the Con&s;titution of Government. Hence it follows, that the obtaining the repeal of them, will &s;atisfy the wi&s;hes of this la&s;t divi&s;ion of the A&s;&s;o|ciators only, a very &s;mall minority of the whole body: and every one mu&s;t concur in admitting, that the proba|bility that they will &s;top, when they have obtained tho&s;e
<PB N="98" REF="103">points which they have fixed as the limits of their claim, is much dimini&s;hed, as the wi&s;hes of the great majority, and their principles, extend indefinitely further.</P>
<P>I COME now to &s;peak of the matter or nature of this engagement, and &s;hall &s;how it in one ca&s;e to be to|tally u&s;ele&s;s, and in all others totally nugatory, as impo&s;ing no obligation on the greater part of the &s;ub|&s;cribers, according to their political principles.</P>
<P>FOR, in the fir&s;t place, if the A&s;&s;ociation do not be|come general, or at lea&s;t obtain &s;trength enough to over|awe Parliament, the promi&s;e will be u&s;ele&s;s: the &s;ecurity of the State from all the effects of their proceeding be|yond their a&s;&s;igned limits, being as firm in their &s;imple want of power, as in their want of power and their re&s;pective obligation (the promi&s;e not to make the at|tempt) conjointly.</P>
<P>FURTHER, if it do not become u&s;ele&s;s, as above, it will then be nugatory: for the &s;overeign power, as the &s;up|porters of this A&s;&s;ociation hold, re&s;ides in the people, whenever they chu&s;e to act; and con&s;equently the legi|&s;lative power, which is a branch thereof. The people may, if they plea&s;e, make, and con&s;equently repeal laws: may they not, therefore, when a&s;&s;ociated, repeal that clau&s;e of the compact, limiting to one object the exertion of their univer&s;al and illimitable &s;overeignty? for if they can repeal a law made to bind them&s;elves, they can annul an article of any obligation, if not founded in moral right.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="104">AND to whom do the &s;ub&s;cribers give this obligation? To the people: and the party to whom it is given is in full power to remit it When, therefore, the &s;ub&s;cription becomes general, the &s;ub&s;cribers will be the people, and it will be an obligation entered into by the people individually, to the people collectively: a compact entered into by them|&s;elves to them&s;elves, which is ab&s;olutely nugatory.</P>
<P>AND if any collection of per&s;ons, &s;igning &s;uch en|gagement, &s;hall call them&s;elves the People, although their numbers be not &s;uch as to entitle them to a&s;&s;ume that name, by their a&s;&s;umption they claim as their own right all the rights of the people; in which is included, ac|cording to their principles, the right of declaring the li|mitation of action, to which they have, or &s;hall pledge them&s;elves, to be void.</P>
<P>THERE are other grounds to &s;how that &s;uch a pro|mi&s;e can be of no validity, or not be the foundation of any obligation on the givers of it. When two parties exi&s;t in a State, the validity of their promi&s;es &s;tands much upon the &s;ame ground as tho&s;e given by independent na|tions to each other. The authors who have treated on the reciprocal rights of nations, have de&s;cribed tho&s;e pro|mi&s;es from which no obligation ari&s;es; and in defining them, I follow Grotius <Q>To give validity to a pro|mi&s;e, the &s;ubject-matter mu&s;t be &s;uch, that the per|&s;on giving it has a full right to perform it; wherefore the promi&s;e to do an illicit act is not valid, becau&s;e no one has, or can acquire, a right to perform it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Jure Bel. &amp; Pac. l. 2. c. 9. &s;. 8.</NOTE>.</Q> And by parity of rea&s;on, a promi&s;e to omit an act of moral
<PB N="100" REF="105">obligation &s;o given, is void and null in it&s;elf. Now I &s;ay, to remove any great grievance, under which we &s;trongly believe our country to &s;uffer, when it is in our power, is an act of moral obligation. The parties to the A&s;&s;o|ciation are known to declare, that this country labours under many removeable grievances, be&s;ide the two Acts for the repeal of which they combine: hence their pro|mi&s;e to &s;top at that repeal, if it be in their power to pro|ceed any farther, is an engagement <HI>not to perform</HI> an act of moral obligation, and therefore null and void.</P>
<P>BUT let it now be admitted, for a moment, that in their &s;pecification of limits, beyond which they would not go, they have contracted an obligation to their op|ponents, or to the State. The melancholy experience of our Civil Wars in the la&s;t age, points out to us what lit|tle reliance can be placed on all &s;uch a&s;&s;urances. From the manners of the nation in that period, it has been &s;hewn, that the utmo&s;t fidelity might have been expected in the performance of all their engagements: from its prevalent and general character of piety, men might with confidence have believed, that the national Prote&s;tation, con&s;ecrated as it were by one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn forms of religion, would be &s;acredly and inviolably adhered to. Religion was con&s;idered by them as a more immutable thing than a form of government is by us. There was no vi&s;ible party among them who conceived that its obligation was founded on the a&s;&s;ent of the nation; that it might be believed experimentally for a month, or a quarter, or a year, and then be aboli&s;hed by ordinance of the two Hou&s;es, and another enacted in its &s;tead, by their own authority, or on the requi&s;ition of the &s;overeign people. They held, when
<PB N="101" REF="106">they took the Prote&s;tation, that no power could ab&s;olve them from it, except that in who&s;e pre&s;ence they profe&s;|&s;ed to have made it. And when we &s;ee by the event, that even in &s;uch times no effectual confidence could be placed in that &s;olemn declaration, what reliance can we afford to the promi&s;es contained in the in&s;trument now brought forward? e&s;pecially if we take into the account, that if it be generally &s;igned, the parties thereto will, according to their own ideas, be, of right, able to ab&s;olve them&s;elves from the obligation thereof. I do not tax the body of the promoters of this A&s;&s;ociation with intending to im|po&s;e upon their countrymen with fal&s;e coin; but when they &s;hall ultimately come to di&s;cover, that according to their principles they have obliged them&s;elves to nothing in the limits they have laid down, I &s;hall not &s;anguine|ly expect that their performances will extend a whit be|yond their obligation. Tho&s;e of our ance&s;tors in more moral times, and on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, fell far &s;hort of theirs.</P>
<P>A FEW remarks mu&s;t be added on the conduct of the populace when excited into action, and its con&s;equences. When embodied, they are always found to be actuated by the mo&s;t extravagant opinions afloat: tho&s;e which mo&s;t flatter their deceitful hopes, their envy of their &s;u|periors, and their ferocity and &s;pirit of depredation; and that day, when the populace, calling it&s;elf the People, &s;hall carry its fir&s;t great point again&s;t a reluctant majo|rity, influenced by the apprehen&s;ion of tumults out of doors, will be effectively the la&s;t day of the power of the three con&s;tituent parts of Parliament; for they are brought forward, by expectations diffu&s;ed generally among them, of a change of their &s;ituation in life for the bet|ter,
<PB N="102" REF="107">of a multiplication of the objects of common u&s;e and enjoyment, and a diminution of the number of the privations their &s;tate condemns them to: their fir&s;t vic|tory will make no difference in their &s;ituation; di&s;ap|pointment will inflame them more, and they will be caught to form new expectations from the effect of going further; and thus they will be rendered eager for a &s;e|cond interpo&s;ition of their &s;trength, which will be dou|bled by an appearance of &s;ucce&s;s, although it has been to them fruitle&s;s. But their Leaders in this country, it will be &s;aid, will have a limited object in view&punc; and will know how to &s;top them. The fallacy of relying upon this, which is matter of univer&s;al experience has been recently confirmed. In France, there were &s;ome great and well-meaning men among tho&s;e who put the whole body of the people into motion. When they thought they had gone far enough, they cho&s;e to &s;top. A &s;et of &s;ubaltern Leaders, at that juncture, urged the populace on further, who&s;e irre&s;i&s;tible weight and impul&s;e bore them down, and they were trampled to death under their feet. Their new conductors, when they had carried them the lengths they de&s;ired, that is, when they thought them&s;elves &s;e|curely placed at their head, wi&s;hed likewi&s;e in their turn that they &s;hould come to a halt. They tried to effect it, and &s;hared the &s;ame fate as their predece&s;&s;ors. The mul|titude were &s;till excited to continue their march by Leaders of a viler cla&s;s. The place they were gotten to, it was truly argued, was little better than a rocky or &s;andy de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt; and they were a&s;&s;ured, that a &s;ingle day's journey more would lead them to the promi&s;ed land of per|fect freedom and abundance, where their whole future lives would be &s;pent in fea&s;ting and revelry. Their migration
<PB N="103" REF="108">under the&s;e la&s;t Leaders, brought them into the land of famine and bloody ferocious anarchy.</P>
<P>IT will become, at this time, the original in&s;titutors of all &s;uch A&s;&s;ociations as have no remote tendency to promote popular in&s;urrections, to reflect, that when the lower cla&s;s of people begin to act in matters of Govern|ment, there is no ability, no vigour, which can re&s;train them within the limits of their original plan. To carry &s;ome points, Cromwell brought the Levelling Agitators into action: when they had &s;erved his purpo&s;e, he wanted to reduce them into their former inefficiency. They re|&s;i&s;ted: by one of the greate&s;t exertions of per&s;onal and political courage, of which Hi&s;tory furni&s;hes an example, he obtained the delu&s;ive appearance of a triumph over them; but the realities of the victory all remained to the &s;pirit of agitating. Even Cromwell him&s;elf gave way: he was compelled to relinqui&s;h his former plans of per|&s;onal greatne&s;s, and &s;eek for new ones, in the act of yielding to that impul&s;e, he could not re&s;i&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix, No. V.</NOTE>. There may be men in this A&s;&s;ociation who&s;e political dexterity and vigour de&s;erve to be thought highly of; but I do not think that man lives, who&s;e arm is &s;o well &s;inewed that he can &s;hape his way again&s;t a torrent which Cromwell could only brea&s;t for a &s;hort time, and then was hurried away by its rapidity. For, to me, in this part of his life, he &s;eems like one of the mightie&s;t of men, &s;truggling for a few minutes again&s;t the &s;tream in &s;ome branch of the In|dus, when the periodical rains have augmented its force to the utmo&s;t, and then compelled almo&s;t to re&s;ign him|&s;elf entirely to it, and to make his way obliquely, with incredible effort, to an i&s;land of jungle in the middle of
<PB N="104" REF="109">the channel, the thickets of which are filled with tigers and &s;erpents, its only inhabitants; where he is inclo&s;ed from all e&s;cape to the &s;afe &s;hore he has left, which lies in full pro&s;pect before him, while deaths without re&s;i&s;tance, the mo&s;t terrible to nature, and which alone could be the object of terror to him, pre&s;s on him, or watch in am|bu&s;h around him on every other &s;ide.</P>
<P>AS accurately as the object of the A&s;&s;ociation is, in words, limited, if we &s;uppo&s;e a majority of the Leaders of name faithfully to intend to di&s;embody it as &s;oon as its &s;ole avowed end is obtained, &s;hall we believe the &s;ame of all of them? For it has been &s;hewn, upon the prin|ciples &s;ome receive as the foundation of Civil Govern|ment, that the promi&s;e this in&s;trument holds out is a nullity; but if it were otherwi&s;e, and were that engagement in its nature binding; and all the o&s;ten&s;ible Heads of the A&s;&s;ociation &s;hould be determinately faithful to it, they are not the men who are the direct and proximate Lea|ders of the populace: it is a certain &s;et of intermediate agents who act in that capacity, who directly hold this terrible power in their hands; and the greater Leaders mu&s;t, like Cromwell, give way to their intermediate in|&s;truments, to tho&s;e who can inflame the Multitude into madne&s;s. They mu&s;t become the in&s;truments of their in&s;truments in new crimes they may dete&s;t, or fall the &s;econd &s;et of victims to irre&s;i&s;tible ignorance, inflamed into immitigable ferocity.</P>
<P>I SHALL add here a little, and but at little, on the mode of rea&s;oning generally pur&s;ued in this Tract. There are men who object to a con&s;tant reference to the tragedies
<PB N="105" REF="110">now acting, and acted in France, during the la&s;t &s;even years; of which &s;ome direct mention, and to which more allu&s;ion has been made, in the preceding Tract. <Q>We are not,</Q> they tell us, <Q>to point out the pretences and means by which that, and, by parity of rea&s;on, any other nation has been en&s;nared into all the mi&s;eries of Anar|chy, in order to keep alive a jealous circum&s;pection with re&s;pect to every mea&s;ure which may introduce it into this kingdom.</Q> Hence the argument from hi&s;torical in|duction chiefly u&s;ed here, which impre&s;&s;es the principles of experience, and tho&s;e only, upon the mind, with the very deci&s;ion and warmth of feeling with which Nature meant them to be embraced, is pro&s;cribed by tho&s;e who lean to the doctrines of the Republican School. They will have men addre&s;&s;ed as beings formed of pure and im|pa&s;&s;ive intellect only: or, if they graciou&s;ly permit us to continue to &s;ee, they prohibit to us the exerci&s;e of the faculty of feeling.</P>
<P>YET they might as well bid us blot out, from the re|cords of univer&s;al hi&s;tory, the errors or crimes which have led &s;o many and great nations into ruin; &s;ay that it is u&s;ele&s;s to make any ob&s;ervations on the cau&s;es which brought it on, or the mi&s;eries by which it was followed. Mu&s;t we extract no u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons for our own nation from the great regi&s;ter of the experience of all ages? It is not in nature, and therefore I am &s;ure it is not in wi&s;dom, to turn away our eyes from the &s;eries of French revolutions, &s;o re|cent, and almo&s;t unprecedented in the &s;um of their calamities; while we are in the very neighbourhood of the contagion, when &s;uch multitudes are de&s;irous of introducing it among us. Who that had ju&s;t &s;een a noble ve&s;&s;el &s;triking upon
<PB N="106" REF="111">a &s;and bank near our very coa&s;t, which had not been be|fore di&s;covered, and totally wrecked, would &s;ay that a buoy, or a floating light, &s;hould not, if po&s;&s;ible, be im|mediately moored upon it? and if the po&s;ition of the whole of the &s;and were not accurately known, that we ought not to keep the &s;ounding line in our hand, when we have the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion that our ve&s;&s;el may be getting upon it?</P>
<P>WHEN Mr. Burke fore&s;aw &s;o many of its en&s;uing ca|lamities in the fir&s;t movements of the French Revolution, his probable train of rea&s;on from cau&s;e to effect was de|rided. Dr. Prie&s;tley fairly told him, <Q>he would not call in que&s;tion his gift of prophecy; his peculiar talent to &s;ee all events, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come, in their mo&s;t concealed cau&s;es.</Q> Experience has neverthele&s;s proved the error of tho&s;e who di&s;believed and tho&s;e who doubted the&s;e predictions; however, we might have been able, with &s;afety to our&s;elves, to con|tinue to doubt who&s;e opinions were the be&s;t founded, until the event &s;hew it clearly. Our exi&s;tence as a na|tion under an orderly government, might not have been hazarded even by di&s;belief; but that the&s;e evils were in reality then impending over France, the followers of Dr. Prie&s;tley now admit: yet from the continuance of the &s;ame propen&s;ions, they will di&s;|pute the probability of the conclu&s;ions here drawn from hi&s;torical induction, that a General A&s;&s;ociation of the People is a mea&s;ure threatening this kingdom with great danger. I conclude with ob&s;erving, that this is a ca&s;e in which we cannot with equal &s;afety po&s;tpone coming to a decided opinion, until a &s;econd and equal &s;eries of ca|lamities to tho&s;e we have been recently witne&s;&s;es to &s;hall convict them of a &s;econd error.</P>

<HEAD>No. I. STRICTURES ON THE STATUTE OF TREASON ENACTED IN THE 25TH OF EDW. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE Law of Trea&s;on, as it &s;tands by 25. Edw. 3. c. 2. has been by many con&s;idered as a ma&s;ter-piece of juri&s;pru|dence, to which nothing is left to be added by &s;ucceeding Legi&s;|lators, without undermining the national liberties. This opinion it now becomes of con&s;equence to a very active party to defend with its utmo&s;t &s;trength. In the preceding pages that &s;tatute has been &s;poken of in terms very different, of the rea&s;on of which &s;ome account certainly ought to be given. Its defects &s;hall therefore here be &s;hewn, which are &s;uch, that in vices of its formation and matter it is ab&s;olutely an unique in our law books.</P>
<P>IT recites &s;even ca&s;es or acts of trea&s;on, three of which directly attack the King's per&s;on and dignity; and when a culprit is indicted on any one of them, the Judges are impowered to pro|ceed to try him for that crime.</P>
<P>THIS is ab&s;tracted from Black&s;tone, who is not &s;paring in his panegyric upon this &s;tatute: he &s;ays further: <Q>But the Act does not &s;top here, but goes on:</Q></P>
<P><Q>BECAUSE other like ca&s;es of trea&s;on may happen in time to come, which cannot be thought of or declared at pre&s;ent, it is accorded, that if any other ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed to be trea&s;on, which is not above &s;pecified, doth happen before any Judge, the Judge &s;hall tarry without going to judgment of the trea&s;on, till the cau&s;e be &s;hewed and declared before the King and his Parlia|ment, whether it ought to be judged trea&s;on or other felony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. 4. c. 85.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Although the meaning of this clau&s;e or &s;alvo &dagger; is obvious, I &s;hall premi&s;e the comment of Nathaniel Bacon upon it to the &s;trictures I have to make thereon: <Q>Other trea&s;ons are left to the determination of the Parliament, as occa&s;ion &s;hould offer it&s;elf; whereof divers examples, of a new &s;tamp, occurred<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I find the clau&s;e to have been &s;o denominated at the trial of Lord Strafford, Bak. Chron.</NOTE>
<PB N="108" REF="114">within forty years next en&s;uing, which were of a temporary regard, and lived and died with the times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon's Continuation of Di&s;cour&s;es, v. 5. p. 78. 1651.</NOTE>.</Q> Tho&s;e ca&s;es <HI>which occa&s;ion offers</HI> mu&s;t be &s;o &s;ubmitted after the act or occa&s;ion occurs. This clau&s;e has been marked with great &s;u&s;picion by a writer of much penetration. Parliament had proceeded upon it, in condemning Sir Thomas Talbot for trea&s;on, for an attempt on the lives of the Dukes of Lanca&s;ter and Glouce&s;ter, in the reign of Richard the Second. He imagined <Q>this mo&s;t advantageous law for the &s;ubject that ever was enacted</Q> to have been violated in this ca&s;e, as <Q>it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that men were to be judged by a law <HI>ex po&s;t facto.</HI> At lea&s;t if &s;uch be the meaning of the clau&s;e it may be affirmed, that men were at that time very ignorant of the fir&s;t principles of law and ju&s;tice<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t v. 3. p. 24, 25. note.</NOTE>.</Q> That &s;uch is the meaning of the clau&s;e is evident on the mere reading; that it is not a new &s;en&s;e of it is evident from Bacon's comment. No legal authority &s;tands higher with the party who attack the two late Acts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The following account of this &s;alvo is extracted from Lane's plea for Lord Strafford, before the Hou&s;e of Lords (See Baker's Chronicle): Fir&s;t, As to the practice upon it: <Q>According to this re&s;ervative, in the eighth year of Richard the Second one charged before the King's Bench was afterwards referred to the Parliament; and there, though the fact <HI>was not</HI> contained in the body of the &s;tatute, yet, becau&s;e of the <HI>provi&s;o</HI> before mentioned, it was adjudged trea&s;on.</Q>&mdash;In the eleventh year of the &s;ame king, the Duke of Ireland, and Nevil Archbi&s;hop of York, were impeached of high trea&s;on by Glouce&s;ter, Arundel, and Warwick; and, <HI>notwith&s;tanding the &s;tatute,</HI> convicted thereof by the <HI>&s;alvo:</HI> but in his twenty-fir&s;t year the &s;entence was rever&s;ed, and tho&s;e three Noblemen them&s;elves were adjudged traitors. In the reign of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or the repeal was repealed (1. H. 4.), and the &s;entence on the three latter Noblemen, in its turn, rever&s;ed. <Q>Such were the to&s;&s;ings to and fro of trea&s;on; and all becau&s;e of that uncertain provi&s;o.</Q> All the confu&s;ion of the law of trea&s;on at this time appears to have ari&s;en from its operation. I di&s;cover no ve&s;tige at this time of any new trea&s;on having been declared; nothing of the kind could be wanted for any purpo&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion. We come now to the &s;entiments of our ance&s;tors thereon, after they had, for a certain period, experienced its effect when put in force.</P>
<P>In the Parliament of the fir&s;t year of Henry the Fourth, <Q>a Petition was preferred by the Nobility to have trea&s;on limited within &s;ome &s;tatute, becau&s;e they knew not what to &s;peak, or what to do, for &s;ear thereof: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n cap. 10. an Act was made upon this Petition, that the &s;alvo &s;hould be holden repealed in all times to come.</Q>&mdash;<Q>And it is &s;aid in the records, that there was great joy at the making of this Act, in that the drawn &s;word hanging over every man's head by this &s;lender thread of a con&s;equence or illation, was removed by that Act.</Q> We &s;hall &s;ee afterward; contrary to what was then urged by Lane, that this &s;alvo was re-enacted before the year 1531.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I PROCEED to &s;hew; fir&s;t, That the Act, with this clau&s;e tacked to it, violates &s;everal of the great fundamental principles
<PB N="109" REF="115">of Legi&s;lation; and in the &s;econd place, that without it, even in the judgement of the authors of it, it was inadequate to the pre|vention of trea&s;on.</P>
<P>FIRST, It violates the great fundamental principles of Legi&s;|lation. Titius has committed a crime; the Act leaves it <Q>to the determination of Parliament,</Q> whether that crime be trea&s;on or not: the trea&s;onable nature of the act of Titius was therefore indeterminate before it was committed; it was not determined to be &s;uch by law before the "occa&s;ion offered it&s;elf." Now I &s;ay, upon the conjoint authority of Black&s;tone and Monte&s;quieu, <Q>that if the crime of high trea&s;on be indeterminate, this alone is &s;ufficient to make any Government degenerate into arbitrary power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Com. v. 4. p. 75. et Sp. L. l. 12. c. 7.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE deci&s;ions of the Legi&s;lature on the &s;alvo, in the ca&s;e of Titius, may be in two forms: Fir&s;t, That the act of Titius &s;hall be judged trea&s;on in him, and in all future ca&s;es; and, &s;econdly, that it &s;hall be &s;o judged, but the judgment &s;hall not be drawn into precedent. In proceedings of parliament upon this Act we find examples of both: the former is upon the principles of the Imperial re&s;cripts and papal decretals; the latter on that of the privilegia noticed in the times of the Roman Commonwealth.</P>
<P>OF a deci&s;ion of the fir&s;t kind, or a crime made trea&s;on by re|&s;cript, we have an in&s;tance in the ca&s;e of one Rou&s;e, in 1531, <Q>who had poi&s;oned a great pot of porridge in the Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter's kitchen.</Q> Poi&s;oning was then by a &s;tatute made trea&s;on, and Rou&s;e &s;uffered upon it. This Act, &s;ays Burnet, <Q>was founded on the power re&s;erved in the 25th of Edward the Third to Parliaments to declare <HI>in time coming</HI> what crimes were trea&s;on<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Re&s;. Abridgment, p. 78.</NOTE>.</Q> We &s;ee this declaratory law operated retro&s;pectively. It is evident, that this mode of proceeding is by a law made <HI>de po&s;t facto.</HI></P>
<P>THIS mode of proceeding was, in e&s;&s;ence, the &s;ame as the Imperial re&s;cript, and of the wor&s;t &s;pecies. A re&s;cript Black&s;tone thus de&s;cribes: <Q>When any doubt aro&s;e upon the con&s;truction of the Roman laws, the u&s;age was to &s;tate the ca&s;e to the Emperor in writing, and take his opinion upon it.&mdash;The an&s;wers of the Emperor were called his re&s;cripts<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Com. v. 1. p. 58.</NOTE>.</Q> Monte&s;|quieu, whom Black&s;tone here copies, adds, that <Q>the Papal decretals were, properly &s;peaking, re&s;cripts: one &s;ees that it is a bad &s;ort of Legi&s;lation.</Q> The title of the chapter here quoted is, "A bad Mode of giving Laws;" and the re&s;cript is the &s;ole in&s;tance he produces. Some of the better Sovereigns of the Empire thought this power too great to be exerci&s;ed in a &s;im|ple Monarchy. Trajan often refu&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue re&s;cripts; and Macrinus had re&s;olved to aboli&s;h the whole collection of them<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p. des L. l. 29. c. 17.</NOTE>.
<PB N="110" REF="116">And, indeed, this law is the only in&s;tance in which the Legi&s;la|ture has &s;hewn any di&s;po&s;ition to copy the Imperial or Papal tyranny.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, But in the year 1388, which being very near the time in which the great &s;tatute of trea&s;on was made, we may ex|pect to find in the proceedings on it a greater conformity to the meaning of the original Legi&s;lators, we find it applied in a manner &s;till more adver&s;e to the nature of law. The Lord Beauchamp of Holt, Sir James Berners, and John Sali&s;bury, were, by virtue of the clau&s;e here cen&s;ured, tried and condemned for high trea&s;on: and the Parliament concluded their proce&s;s by a declaration, that none of the articles decided on the&s;e trials to be trea&s;on &s;hould ever afterwards be drawn into precedent by the Judges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume, v. 3. p. 23.</NOTE>; that is, the&s;e acts were trea&s;on in the individuals, but in no other per&s;ons. There was nothing, however, in this proceeding which was contrary to the letter of the &s;tatute.</P>
<P>THE limits an article of an Appendix impo&s;e upon me will not permit me to &s;tate an objection which might be, with very little propriety, urged here: objections little in real weight may re|quire long an&s;wers: men to whom it may occur will &s;ee it is to be &s;olved by the following principle: There are two bad &s;tates into which a mixed and good Government may degenerate, de&s;|poti&s;m and anarchy. When circum&s;tances give us the power of guarding again&s;t either, and the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of u&s;ing it be <HI>extreme,</HI> we are to u&s;e it. What is to be done, on <Q>&s;uch never-to-be-expected occa&s;ions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Walpole at the Trial of Sacheverel.</NOTE>,</Q> is to be &s;ought for only in that code of moral law which is written in the bo&s;om of the upright friend of his country. As they cannot be fore&s;een, the laws of the land cannot provide again&s;t them; they cannot ordain when their let|ter may be di&s;obeyed; or when, for the &s;afety of the State, mea&s;ures mu&s;t be taken again&s;t individuals in ca&s;es alike unfore&s;een, and therefore alike unprovided for. In each, by an invincible nece&s;&s;ity, the nece&s;&s;ity of its nature, <HI>law mu&s;t be &s;ilent.</HI> This is &s;imply a maxim of the great men who effected the Revolution, with its conver&s;e added.</P>
<P>EVERY &s;tatute which has been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively convenient for an Oppo&s;ition to ground tho&s;e arguments upon which they expect will operate with the mo&s;t force on the populace, has &s;ucce&s;&s;ively enjoyed, for its term, the honour of being called the Palladium of Briti&s;h Liberty; and the preten&s;ions of none were ever more &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted upon than the &s;tatute under con&s;ideration, at the pre&s;ent juncture. But if we look at the conclu&s;ion of it, we may pronounce him to be a very "feeble amateur" indeed, and with no knowledge of the <HI>co&s;tume,</HI> who pretends that this is rightly named the Palladium. The in&s;ignia point out the error very clearly; the &s;word &s;he holds in her hand is the very &s;word of
<PB N="111" REF="117">tyranny, hidden almo&s;t "from hilt to point" with Imperial re&s;cripts and Papal decretals: one might as &s;oon call a &s;tatue with a dagger in one hand and a cup of poi&s;on in the other by the name of Hope.</P>
<P>TYRANNY in the principle of a law &s;ometimes begets ab&s;olute relaxation in the admini&s;tration of it; its effects in other in&s;tances may not go quite &s;o far: the admini&s;tration of it may only be|come mild. And this appears to have been the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the &s;tatute of trea&s;on in England: and by an error into which men very ea&s;ily fall, the &s;pirit with which the law was admini|&s;tered has been mi&s;taken for the &s;pirit of the law it&s;elf. This has been the ca&s;e with the law under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>But it is urged, that <Q>it is an infringement to the liberties of the &s;ubject to increa&s;e this catalogue of trea&s;ons: and when any additions have been made to the &s;tatute of Edward the Third, in former ages, the experience of our forefathers has taught them the nece&s;&s;ity of taking them away, and re&s;toring its former &s;implicity to the law on this head</Q> There are rea&s;ons why more and more &s;evere and unju&s;t laws may be expected to be found in every State under this title than under any other: but that is not the general character of the laws of trea&s;on which have been made in this country &s;ince the Revolution. Will any per&s;on contend, that the four Acts which placed the Princes of the Hou&s;e of Hanover upon the Throne, and &s;ecured them there, were not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be made, in aid of the &s;tatute of Edward, for the pre&s;ervation of their liberties? Their de&s;truction is menaced now by a different &s;et of enemies, de&s;cribed neither by the&s;e laws nor that of Edward; and further provi&s;ions again&s;t <HI>them</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE authors of the &s;tatute it&s;elf declare, that it is inade|quate to the prevention or puni&s;hment of many acts of trea&s;on which may be equal in criminality to tho&s;e it defines. They admit, that "other like ca&s;es of trea&s;on may happen in time to come," and their inability to think of or declare them; but they pro|mi&s;e to provide for them as they &s;hall ari&s;e, one after another, by a &s;eries of <HI>ex pe&s;t facto</HI> laws or judgments.</P>
<P>BEFORE this Act pa&s;&s;ed, the number of trea&s;ons by the common law was greatly multiplied. In &s;even ca&s;es it continues the cognizance of that crime to the ordinary courts, as before, and e&s;tabli&s;hes a new mode of proceeding upon all others, but &s;ubver&s;ive of the very funda|mental principles of Legi&s;lation ordinarily ob&s;erved in the milder &s;imple Monarchies. That great and excellent Lawyer, Sir Matthew Hale, &s;aw clearly (what the Act it&s;elf admits) that the enumera|tion of trea&s;ons contained in it was not &s;o complete as to preclude the nece&s;&s;ity of additions to it in future: and he lays down the con&s;titutional mode of providing for the&s;e omitted ca&s;es, as they &s;hall ari&s;e, in the following terms: <Q>That as the authoritative
<PB N="112" REF="118">deci&s;ion of the <HI>ca&s;us omi&s;&s;i</HI> is re&s;erved to the king and Parlia|ment, the mo&s;t regular way to do it is by a declarative Act<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bl. Com. v. 4. p. 85.</NOTE>.</Q> The authors of the two Bills have, therefore, followed the autho|rity of Sir Matthew Hale, and the precedents of tho&s;e great men who &s;eated the Hou&s;e of Hanover on the Throne. In what &s;en&s;e &s;uch an Act is to be declaratory mu&s;t be explained. It is not to be under&s;tood as declarative of the meaning of the clau&s;es of the 25th of Edward the Third defining certain trea&s;ons, but of the law with re&s;pect to the <HI>ca&s;us omi&s;&s;us,</HI> the object of the new Act; &s;uppo&s;ed to have been left, as &s;hown above, trea&s;on at the com|mon law, but under particular circum&s;tances, as triable only in Parliament. The mode of &s;peaking Sir Matthew Hale here makes u&s;e of is founded on that legal fiction, that the common law is a code ab&s;olutely perfect; therefore <Q>it expounds the &s;everal &s;pe|cies of temporal offences<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bl. Com. v. 1. p. 68.</NOTE></Q> perfectly; <Q>as always intending to conform to the perfection of rea&s;on<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 70.</NOTE>.</Q> Hence it mu&s;t al|ways intend to be co-exten&s;ive to the nece&s;&s;ities of prevention or puni&s;hment in all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es of trea&s;on. But in ca&s;es of which no legal record can be found, it is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, that the Executive Power &s;hould not have the dangerous authority of de|claring what that perfect code &s;ays; the Legi&s;lature is alone com|petent to do it by a declaratory Act. Hence Hale calls &s;uch an Act declaratory.</P>
<P>THUS the po&s;&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of additions to the &s;tatute of Edward is proved by the expre&s;s admi&s;&s;ion of the &s;tatute it&s;elf; the expedience of making them, by the Acts on the Hanoverian Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, which pre&s;erved the Con&s;titution; and that <Q>the mo&s;t regular way</Q> has in this in&s;tance been pur&s;ued, we have the te&s;timony of Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Hale, <Q>the mo&s;t brilliant exam|ple to his own age and to po&s;terity&mdash;of exact ju&s;tice and profound juri&s;prudence<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Burnet in Burke's Letter to a Member, &amp;c. p. 16.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER an act is committed, to determine whether it falls under an a&s;&s;igned title in the criminal laws belongs to the Executive Power: but when Parliament a&s;&s;umes this function, as directed by the &s;tatute of Edward, there is a union of the Legi&s;lative and Executive Powers in the &s;ame hands; which con&s;titutes, and is the very definition of arbitrary power, however ve&s;ted. We are not to define what the imperative voice of extreme nece&s;&s;ity, that of the &s;upreme law, the <HI>&s;alus populi,</HI> may &s;ometimes demand: the utmo&s;t efforts of human wi&s;dom cannot annihilate this nece&s;&s;ity perpetually; the be&s;t municipal laws dimini&s;h it the mo&s;t. To leave exce&s;&s;es to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the former law, when it can be effected by the latter, is to leave the fate of Society, in a certain degree, to depend on the conflict of anarchy and arbitrary power; and to define one more of the crimes leading to that nece&s;&s;ity (the
<PB N="113" REF="119">object of each of the&s;e Bills), and provide again&s;t it by an expre&s;s law, is a triumph of legal government over both.</P>
<P>WHEN danger threatens the citadel of the Con&s;titution from a new quarter, new works mu&s;t be ca&s;t up to defend it, and their con&s;truction mu&s;t vary with the mode of attack. However, the defence of the two Bills is not confined to that ground; the de|fences, on the quarter on which the a&s;&s;ailants make their ap|proach, were ma&s;ked: the embra&s;ures are now opened, and they &s;ee their danger fairly before the attack. Pur&s;uant al&s;o to the humaner laws of war, the former charges of the guns, ru&s;ty nails, broken gla&s;s, and old iron, are drawn, and they are fairly &s;hot|ted.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, I mu&s;t retract what I have &s;aid in defence of a cen&s;ure pa&s;&s;ed by Mr. Reeves on &s;ome modern reformers, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;ider a good Con&s;titution in theory as of more con&s;equence than a good Con&s;titution in practice, or effective liberty. It certainly ought to be mitigated, now we &s;ee that they are willing and de&s;irous of making an unre&s;erved &s;acrifice of what the theory of the Con&s;titution has acquired, by the two laws, to obtain a little practical anarchy.</P>

<P>WHEN we draw together the &s;cattered notices which our hi&s;|torians have given us of the progre&s;s this nation had made in general knowledge in the age of Edward the Third, we &s;eem to be &s;urveying a &s;ketch of the ideas and tran&s;actions of an enlight|ened period immediately preceding our own; and if they had &s;o arranged their materials, this conclu&s;ion mu&s;t have pre&s;ented it&s;elf to them, and they would certainly have been able, by their re|&s;earches, to have collected many more in&s;tances of a like charac|ter, to e&s;tabli&s;h this ob&s;ervation, than can be here brought for|ward.</P>
<P>THE politics of England, with re&s;pect to foreign countries, were then the &s;ame as tho&s;e &s;y&s;tematically embraced at and &s;ince the Revolution, a triple alliance of England, Germany, and the Low Countries, again&s;t France.</P>
<P>THE religious principles of that period (as Hume him&s;elf admits) had very nearly anticipated tho&s;o of the Reformation. Wickliffe preached its doctrines, and the laity were de&s;irous of flinging off the Papal obedience. Edward availed him&s;elf of this
<PB N="114" REF="120">revolution of opinions as far as it &s;uited his purpo&s;e, and no fur|ther. He referred the Pope's claim of tribute to the Parliament, who &s;upported him in withholding it, on the ground that the act of John, being without the national con&s;ent, could not change the tenure by which he held the Crown. The &s;tatute again&s;t provi&s;ors was pa&s;&s;ed in this reign; and all appeals to Rome were prohibited.</P>
<P>IF the Hou&s;e of Commons had not attained its pre&s;ent weight in the Con&s;titution, its privileges were extended &s;o far that they were on the very point of e&s;tabli&s;hing it. Hume calls the inter|po&s;ition of the Court in elections to the Hou&s;e the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of e&s;tabli&s;hed liberty. Every art was then u&s;ed to &s;ecure to "the King's friends and men in place" &s;eats in that A&s;&s;embly. This abu&s;e was remon&s;trated again&s;t, and with &s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. v. 2. p. 413.</NOTE>. He anticipated the practice of this age, of applying to Parliament for an approbation of mea&s;ures drawing expence after them before he engaged in them, that he might thereon ground his future demands for &s;upply<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. 2. p. 503.</NOTE>. The Commons &s;ometimes remon&s;trated with Edward with &s;everity, and they obliged him to di&s;mi&s;s his mi&s;tre&s;s. The Clergy, in a di&s;pute with him, charged him with a de&s;ign of introducing the practice of impo&s;ing taxes without con&s;ent of parliament<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. 423.</NOTE>; that is, to &s;ubvert a Con&s;titution already under&s;tood; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e had practi&s;ed it occa&s;ionally, and given his negative to an Act to puni&s;h the tax-gatherers.</P>
<P>IN this reign likewi&s;e Parliament made retrenchments of the prerogative, and e&s;pecially the giving up of the claim of pur|ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance, and two of the greater feudal aids; the price of a libe|ral &s;upply. Edward afterward d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">genuou&s;ly eluded his conce&s;|&s;ion<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ib. 413.</NOTE>. Among the grievances they remon&s;trated again&s;t, and kept within bounds, were the powers a&s;&s;umed by the Privy Council and Star Chamber, the di&s;pen&s;ing power, monopolies, and pre&s;&s;ing; they limited the prerogative of Parliament, and remon&s;trated again&s;t its abu&s;es, and the &s;topping of ju&s;tice by warrant<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ib. 506.510.</NOTE>. And the power of i&s;&s;uing writs to levy &s;hip-money was aboli&s;hed in the laver end of this reign, or the beginning of the following<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">V. 6. p. 254.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Commons in this age al&s;o under&s;tood the privileges ve&s;ted in them, in con&s;equence of their having the cu&s;tody of the national pur&s;e, with accuracy, and at lea&s;t in their full extent. The merchants having agreed with the King to augment the duty upon &s;ome article of export (wool I believe), were &s;um|moned before the Hou&s;e, and cen&s;ured for breach of privilege: the only precedent which I &s;uppo&s;e can be properly urged again&s;t the &s;ubject &s;upplying the Crown with money voluntarily: a point tacitly given up by the Petition of Right; an article of
<PB N="115" REF="121">which is, <Q>that no man &s;hall be <HI>compelled</HI> to yield any gift, loan, or benevolence, tax or &s;uch like charge, without common con&s;ent by act of parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bl. Com. v. 1. p. 140.</NOTE>:</Q> which, by prohibiting com|pul&s;ive levies<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tacitly e&s;tabli&s;hes the legality of voluntary contri|butions, and is in effect a regulating clau&s;e, not a prohibition.</P>
<P>THE hereditary claim of the Crown to &s;ome duties on expor|tation was already a point of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and jealou&s;y to the people on the acce&s;&s;ion of Richard the Second: and in the expedient the Commons made u&s;e of to e&s;tabli&s;h their rights, without detri|ment to the revenue, we &s;ee a refinement and dexterity which has &s;eldom been equalled: they were ordered to cea&s;e at Mid|&s;ummer, and to be renewed on the Fea&s;t of St. Peter, the interval being five days<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hume Hi&s;t. v. 3. p. 5. on wools, wool-fells, and &s;kins.</NOTE>, <Q>for that thereby the King &s;hould be inter|rupted for claiming &s;uch grant as due.</Q> The &s;ame A&s;&s;embly annexed a &s;trict clau&s;e of appropriation to the &s;upplies they granted; and took effectual care of their ob&s;ervance, by appoint|ing &s;ome of their own Members to &s;uperintend the receipt and di&s;bur&s;ements of the &s;um levied<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A CERTAIN modern practice, and e&s;teemed of a more ambi|guous merit, was in this age fir&s;t perhaps adopted &s;ince the time of the Romans. In the reign of Edward the Third we di&s;cover the fir&s;t in&s;tance of a public debt on parliamentary &s;ecurity: it was voted that the King &s;hould take up 20,000 &s;acks of wool on the credit of an aid for two years; the value to be repaid out of the produce of that aid. The amount of the advance Mr. Hume &s;tates at 300,000 l.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hume, v. 2. p. 414.</NOTE>; but, on the authority of an extremely well informed writer, its lea&s;t value mu&s;t be taken at 450,000 l.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">On the qualified Exportation of Wool di&s;cu&s;&s;ed hi&s;torically, p. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>GREAT freedom was made u&s;e of, in this period, in the de|bates of the Commons. Tho&s;e on the &s;ubject of Alice Pierce, mentioned above, are &s;ufficient proof of this. Edward likewi&s;e &s;ometimes impri&s;oned the Speakers, <HI>after the breaking up of a Parliament.</HI> If our annals were complete, we &s;hould find England then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her Hampdens and Falklands, her Hydes and her Pyms. But the great Commoners of that age could only impre&s;s upon the Con&s;titution a quiet and progre&s;&s;ive amelioration, not bury it under the ruins of legal prerogative: Edward the Third &s;at upon the Throne, not Charles the Fir&s;t.</P>
<P>THE minority of Richard the Second &s;ugge&s;ted further views to the Commons: they then fir&s;t cho&s;e a Speaker; and it is &s;in|gular, that the election fell on Peter de la Marc, whom the late King had impri&s;oned for his &s;peeches in a preceding Parliament. That Hou&s;e was the fir&s;t to take up the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Regency,
<PB N="116" REF="122">petitioning the Lords, that a Council of Nine might be appointed to carry on the public affairs during the King's minority; and although their interposition was in that form, they were of con|&s;equence enough to carry their point. But another exten&s;ion of power which they aimed at, that all the great Officers &s;hould be appointed by Parliament during that minority, that is, that the Commons &s;hould have a negative on all &s;uch appointments, they failed in. Before this Parliament was di&s;&s;olved, they affirmed the right, and the nece&s;&s;ity, of that A&s;&s;embly meeting once in each year.</P>
<P>CIRCUMSTANCES which happened &s;oon after repre&s;&s;ed the further exertions of this ri&s;ing &s;pirit of freedom in the Hou&s;e of Commons, which the vigour and glory of Edward the Third could not effect. The in&s;urrection of Wat Tyler mu&s;t have infu&s;ed no little jealou&s;y of popular principles into the minds of men of property of both Hou&s;es, in the &s;ame manner as we &s;aw the in&s;urrection of Lord George Gordon produce the defeat of &s;ome popular mea&s;ures, which were carrying on, when it com|menced, with great appearance of &s;ucce&s;s. It was thus this &s;alu|tary check upon abu&s;es, the importance of the Lower Hou&s;e, lo&s;ing much of its vigour, England &s;oon came to experience all the calamities in which the conte&s;ts of a di&s;orderly, feeble, pre|cipitate Court, and a factious Nobility, could involve a nation, terminating in a long period of degradation and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>A FEW mi&s;cellaneous circum&s;tances will be here added, to &s;hew, that this nation was, in other re&s;pects, in a very advanced &s;tate at this period. Mr. Chalmers, in his Comparative E&s;timate, informs us, that land at the death of Edward the Third &s;old for twenty-five years purcha&s;e. A &s;cene of turbulence and revolu|tion commenced &s;oon after. In the reign of Henry the Fourth we &s;ee in the hi&s;tory of the times that it was fallen to twenty, and in that of Edward the Fourth to ten years purcha&s;e. Pre|&s;ently after the acce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Hanover it re-attained the value it had &s;old for at the acce&s;&s;ion of Richard the Second. The modern maxims of commerce were then likewi&s;e under&s;tood. To rival the trade of the Netherlands, their manufacturers were invited to &s;ettle in this kingdom; the exportation of unwrought wool was prohibited, and the wearing of foreign cloths: and it was declared by law, that <Q>trade &s;hould be free, <HI>notwith&s;tanding grants or u&s;ages,</HI> &s;eeing &s;uch are to the common prejudice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Qual. Export. of Wool, p. 6, 7. 9.</NOTE>.</Q> Our foreign commerce, likewi&s;e, brought us in a balance of 250,000 l. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Biog. Brit. art. "Clarke."</NOTE> a-year of the money of that time, containing the fame quantity or &s;ilver as 750,000 l. of our pre&s;ent money: which &s;um it did not on an average exceed in the period from the Re&s;tora|tion to the Revolution.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="123">THE French language was in this age prohibited in law pro|ceedings, and the hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h literature affords a &s;trong proof of the degree of the refinement of manners to which we had then attained. This is exhibited in the characters and &s;ome of the tales of Chaucer. Polite &s;atire, and comic portraits, touched with a light and free pencil, can only be produced by men of genius, who live in periods very much civilized. Let the ability of the writer be what it will, the characters drawn in a &s;emi-barbarous age have little of individual nature in them: they all have the allegorical air of moral qualities per&s;onified. Athens had acquired its highe&s;t degree of politene&s;s when Menander wrote his comedies. France did not produce her Moliere until the age of Louis the Fourteenth; and the latter will not be found much more free from the delineation of ab&s;tract qualities in&s;tead of living characters, or from overcharged colouring, than our own countryman, the delicacy of who&s;e hand certainly was not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by that of Theophra&s;tus or La Bruyere: and if we grant his ta&s;te out&s;tripped that of his age more than any of tho&s;e writers mentioned above, &s;till that age in which he lived mu&s;t have been highly civilized before it could produce &s;uch a writer, or feel the beauties of his comic manner. His page in|deed is di&s;graced with &s;ome gro&s;s immoralities, but it is only to be wi&s;hed that this could be urged as a proof he did not write in a poli&s;hed period. The works of the Augu&s;tan age, and tho&s;e written in France &s;ince the death of Louis the Thirteenth, by men who have in the &s;ame manner di&s;graced fine abilities and a fine ta&s;te, will not &s;uffer this to be urged again&s;t the con&s;equences drawn from the poetry of Chaucer.</P>
<P>NOT only the manner in which the&s;e characters were drawn decides upon that of the age, it may be al&s;o &s;hewn, from the matter they contain, in that of the <HI>Squyer,</HI> we may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have an account of the education of the young gentry of Eng|land at that period. Among his other qualifications, he made ver&s;es, was in&s;tructed in drawing and mu&s;ic, and (as we expre&s;s our&s;elves) wrote a fine hand; and he had made a tour in the provinces of Flanders, then the &s;eat of opulence. Nor is the poet here de&s;cribing what, in his opinion, the education of a young gentleman ought to be, but what it was: the former is to be &s;een in that of his own &s;on Lowys, who, although he did not exceed the age of ten years, had already acquired the elements of the La|tin language, and made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in arithmetic and the doctrine of proportion: he earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be taught a&s;tronomy, and his father thought him to be &s;o &s;ufficiently qua|lified, that he complied with his reque&s;t, and wrote his Treati&s;e on the A&s;trolabe for his u&s;e. In his preface, he &s;uppo&s;es his work on a&s;tronomy might be generally read.</P>
<P>THIS excellent direction to the national education and objects of pur&s;uit, was mo&s;t probably given to them by the writings and
<PB N="118" REF="124">recent di&s;coveries of Roger Bacon, born not only to re&s;tore what is worth retaining of the ancient philo&s;ophy, but to lead it far on toward the perfection it has &s;ince attained. He died about thirty-five years before the acce&s;&s;ion of Edward the Third.</P>
<P>HISTORIANS &s;eem tacitly to have laid it down as an hypo|the&s;is that Society has been in a progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of improvement ever &s;ince the union of the Saxon kingdoms. Hence they are perpetually expre&s;&s;ing their wonder at the repeated in&s;tances of policy and refinement occurring in the period here treated of. But our advancement was then great: it could not be called a &s;emi-barbarous age: it can only be &s;aid of it, that it &s;till retained traces of barbari&s;m. It was not only the dawn of the day, or the fir&s;t beams of the ri&s;ing &s;un, which enlightened our ance&s;tors, that luminary was already mounted many degrees above the horizon; &s;ome flying clouds, indeed, which the wind was di&s;&s;ipating, at intervals ob&s;cured it for a little time, or ca&s;t a dark moving tract of &s;hadow over the land&s;cape.</P>
<P>A TURBULENT and di&s;a&s;trous period of civil war and u&s;urpations en&s;ued: a &s;hort and dazzling term of military &s;plendor, which promi&s;ed to terminate, only &s;erved ultimately to increa&s;e its calamities. The acqui&s;itions of the age of Ed|ward the Third were lo&s;t almo&s;t as &s;oon as made. After the civil wars were ended, the heavy domination of the Tudors long repre&s;&s;ed the efforts of the genius of this nation, to recover that height from whence it had fallen; and thus the reign of genuine &s;cience in Europe, de&s;tined to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by Britain, was po&s;tponed between two and three cen|turies by our internal commotions, begun by a general in|&s;urrection of the populace of eight counties round the capital, "on the principles of primitive equality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume's Hi&s;t. v. iii. p. 8.</NOTE>," and directed to "the purpo&s;e of levelling all mankind."</P>

<HEAD>No. III. ON A LEADING CAUSE OF THE CIVIL WARS IN THE REIGN OF CHARLES THE SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not know that it has been ob&s;erved, that a &s;ingle fact accounts for the unrelenting vehemence of the illegal mea|&s;ures again&s;t Lord Strafford: the famous inflammatory remon|&s;trance,
<PB N="119" REF="125">the ra&s;h attempt of the King to &s;eize the five Mem|bers, and the continuation of the attack of the Commons upon the royal power, after they had re&s;tored the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>COUNT Lally-Tolendal, in his Life of Lord Strafford, a work full of curio&s;ity and elegance, informs us, that he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of legal proofs of trea&s;on again&s;t the Lords Saville and Kimbolton, and Pym, Strode, and their accom|plices, as having called a foreign enemy, the Scots, into Eng|land. Mr. Hume informs us, that if Lord Strafford had not been &s;uddenly prevented by the accu&s;ation of the Commons, he had that very day, it was thought, charged Pym, Hamp|den, and others, with trea&s;on on that account. Now Hamp|den, Pym, and Strode, were three of the five Members ac|cu&s;ed by the King: the other two were Hollis and Sir Ar|thur Hazlerig. I lay it down as a probable &s;uppo&s;ition, that they were among <HI>tho&s;e others</HI> not directly named by the&s;e writers.</P>
<P>THOUGH the thanks of the Hou&s;e had been given to the Scots for their brotherly a&s;&s;i&s;tance in marching into England, an Act of indemnity had been procured by tho&s;e who invited them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Hume, v. vi. p. 402, affirms, that an Act of oblivion had pa&s;&s;ed. The public Acts of the Long Parliament, which received the royal a&s;&s;ent, are in number nineteen: their titles are now lying before me. There is no &s;uch Act of oblivion among them. The title of the 10th is, "An Act for Confirma|tion of the Treaty of Pacification between England and Scotland, with Com|mi&s;&s;ions and Articles thereupon." If this Act had contained &s;uch a clau&s;e of oblivion and indemnity, it would have been recited in a title which particular|rizes commi&s;&s;ions and articles. It contained, indeed, "A Provi&s;ion for the Security of his Maje&s;ty's Party in Scotland, in reference to all former trou|bles, excluding only the Scotch Bi&s;hops and four more of that nation," Hey|lin's Life of Laud, p. 466. But this does not amount to an indemnity for trea&s;ons committed in England. If a law was pa&s;&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, Hume does not mention this remarkable Act in its proper place. He might be led into error by &s;uppo&s;ing the thanks of the Hou&s;es to the Scots for their bro|therly a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be a virtual Act of oblivion for their inviters. Be&s;ides, if the King had pa&s;&s;ed an Act of indemnity, is it probable that he would have attempted to bring the five Members to a trial, who might have pleaded it, or that the Commons would not have reproached him for an attempt to violate an Act to which he had given his a&s;&s;ent?</P></NOTE>; &s;ome of tho&s;e even who thought the nation benefited by that mea&s;ure, might di&s;like the precedent, and the actors therein might fear to di&s;clo&s;e the part they had taken, &s;o far as to &s;olicit &s;uch a &s;afeguard; they remained, therefore, under the penalties of the law of Trea&s;on, and thought them&s;elves reduced to act upon that mo&s;t dreadful of all maxims, <HI>ne fe|riare, feri: meurs, ou tue</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Corneille, Cid.</NOTE>." Strafford was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the fulle&s;t evidence<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Preuves irre&s;i&s;tibles, Count L. T. p. 337.</NOTE> again&s;t them, and they determined at the
<PB N="120" REF="126">proper in&s;tant to anticipate his attack upon them: but this could not be done with &s;afety to them when the per&s;on of the Earl was out of their reach. Hence it was nece&s;&s;ary, for other cau&s;es than tho&s;e commonly alledged, that their plan of a counter-accu&s;ation &s;hould be for a &s;ea&s;on unknown to him; for this rea&s;on the doors of the Hou&s;e were locked, at the time they thought proper that the &s;ubject of his impeach|ment &s;hould come on, that no intelligence of their intended mea&s;ure &s;hould tran&s;pire, until it was too late for him to an|ticipate their accu&s;ation by his own. Thus tho&s;e of the Com|mons who were in the &s;ecret flung their deliberations again&s;t him, rather into the form of a private con&s;ultation of con|&s;pirators, than the debates of a &s;enate. This apprehen&s;ion of their own danger led them at la&s;t to the unprecedented and double form of their proceeding again&s;t him; the parts of which were, a trial for trea&s;on, in&s;tituted in the ordinary form before the Peers, which was interrupted by the pro&s;ecutors them&s;elves, before &s;entence was &s;uffered to be given, by a new cour&s;e of proceedings, a bill of attainder. What they could do con&s;i&s;tently with their apprehen&s;ions for their own &s;afety, to avoid this &s;pecies of nece&s;&s;ity of committing a murder, by what had &s;o equivocal an appearance of being the &s;word of the law, they attempted. Count Lally, on the authority of the Journal of Archbi&s;hop Laud, informs us, that Lord Lon|don and the mo&s;t powerful of the Pre&s;byterians offered to Lord Strafford his life and liberty, on condition that he &s;hould join them, and that he refu&s;ed the propo&s;ition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay Hi&s;tor. p. 402.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>IT is obvious they mu&s;t have conjectured, that the train of their negociations with the Scots was perfectly known to the King, though he might not be ma&s;ter of the legal evidence. This might confirm them in their plan of continuing their own power, by perpetuating the &s;itting of the Parliament after that a&s;&s;embly had been made triennial; that the danger might meet them com|bined together in perfect union with, and at the head of a great party in both Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The King's journey into Scotland was a real &s;ubject of alarm to this party: they dreaded that he &s;hould be able to obtain more particular information again&s;t them; and finding that by their importunity they were not able &s;o much as to get him to put it off, they appointed a Committee to attend upon him, under pretence of &s;eeing the articles of pacification executed, but in reality to be &s;pies upon his conduct<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hume, vol. vi. p. 359.</NOTE>. One of the mo&s;t eminent of the Members who had concurred in the invitation, was among the&s;e deputies.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="127">CHARLES, when in Scotland, by a liberal di&s;tribution of ti|tles, and &s;uch favours as remained in his power, had attached the leading Covenanters to him for a time, and obtained their con|fidence. "He expo&s;tulated with &s;ome of the chief among them, touching their late coming into England in a ho&s;tile man|ner, and found that &s;ome, who were now leading men in the Hou&s;es of Parliament, had invited them to it," and he "fur|ni&s;hed him&s;elf with &s;ome proofs of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heylin's Life of Laud, p. 499.</NOTE>." The Committee, whom the Parliament had &s;ent to watch his conduct in Scotland, could not be entirely ignorant of the&s;e communications, nor would they fail to &s;ignify this increa&s;e of danger to tho&s;e of the two Hou&s;es who were affected by it. Thus &s;ome of the Covenanters betrayed their confederates to the King. This pre|pares us for what is to follow. The Earl of Leve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who had on his knees prote&s;ted in the hou&s;e of the Earl of Kinnoul, that he would never bear arms again&s;t the King, in a little more than two years after led for the third time a Scotch army into Eng|land. A liberal &s;ub&s;idy from the Parliament had again changed the inclinations of &s;ome bad men of that nation, and a &s;econd prevailed upon them to give up their Sovereign. The confi|dence al&s;o which Charles repo&s;ed in the di&s;coveries he had made, which he pre&s;erved as a la&s;t re&s;ource to protect him again&s;t the machinations of his enemies in England, proved unexpectedly one of the great cau&s;es of his ruin.</P>
<P>THE dangerous &s;ituation of tho&s;e who invited the Scots into England became daily, in their own eyes, more and more evident. When he went into Scotland, "it was voiced to all that he parted a gracious King from a contented people<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Baker, 514.</NOTE>." His tour into that kingdom had greatly &s;trengthened his intere&s;ts there: he was become extremely popular in this city, as was evident in his &s;plendid reception on his return, and his party in the Hou&s;e of Commons was already equal, and becoming &s;upe|rior to theirs. The accu&s;ation again&s;t them they mu&s;t have known to have been &s;trengthened with new evidence, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Parliament would be &s;oon fini&s;hed, and that a&s;|&s;embly of cour&s;e di&s;&s;olve it&s;elf, and they return into the ma&s;s of private &s;ubjects, amenable to the cour&s;e of law; their fears for their &s;afety urged them therefore to renew the attack upon the King by exciting the populace of the city afre&s;h again&s;t him, and they hoped likewi&s;e, by a &s;eries of mea&s;ures of irritation, to provoke him into &s;ome precipitate mea&s;ures, that might revive tho&s;e re&s;entments again&s;t his pa&s; admini&s;tration, which think|ing men began to wi&s;h to be forgotten; and that by the&s;e means, in conjunction, they might &s;o far deba&s;e his character and dimi|ni&s;h his power, that they might have nothing to fear from his

<P>THIS was the voting and publi&s;hing the famous Remon&s;trance, addre&s;&s;ed by the Commons to the People, again&s;t the King, con|taining every thing with which his whole admini&s;tration had been truly or fal&s;ely accu&s;ed, eac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> particular heightened with all the arts of exaggeration. There is hi&s;torical evidence, that the fears of this active party in the Hou&s;e for their own &s;afety were their motives to this &s;tep, &s;o in&s;trumental in kindling the Civil War; for immediately after the pa&s;&s;ing of it, Cromwell told Lord Falk|land, "that if the Remon&s;trance had not been carried, he was re&s;olved to have converted the &s;mall remains of his e&s;tate into ready money the next day, and to have taken the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of quitting the kingdom; and this, he affirmed, was the &s;enti|ment al&s;o of &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men of the party<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biog. Brit. Cromwell, v. iv. 479. from Clarendon.</NOTE>." Many additional in&s;ults followed the Remon&s;trance, before the King was provoked to what he had unfortunately confided in as a &s;trong re&s;ource, his impotent and unfortunate attempt of &s;eizing the five Members, to bring them to a trial for trea&s;on, while they were yet at the head of a victorious party, the Hou&s;e of Lords in con&s;ternation, and the irritated and licentious populace of London at their command.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems, therefore, highly probable, that the u&s;e intended to be made by Lord Strafford of the evidence he had procured, co&s;t him his life; that the fear of its effects likewi&s;e produced the Remon&s;trance, and the further uncon&s;titutional attempts upon the royal power which followed it; for, after the &s;anguinary ex|ample tho&s;e who had joined in the invitation of the Scots had exhibited in the ca&s;e of Lord Strafford, that they might not &s;uf|fer for what was trea&s;on by law, they were compelled to become in reality traitors<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>They took arms again&s;t the King to wre&s;t the militia from him.

<P>YET there was every thing to fear for our liberties at the time the Scotch in&s;urrection began, the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them was almo&s;t totally to be regained.

I &s;hall now give a brief view of the means by which the&s;e two Revolutions were effected. The authors of the Revolution of 1688 invited a foreign army to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; of a Prote&s;tant nation, the natural and old al|lies of the kingdom, under the hu&s;band of a prince&s;s claiming to be pre|&s;umptive heire&s;s of the Crown. The nece&s;&s;ity fully ju&s;tified this mea&s;ure; but under the&s;e circum&s;tances it appears &s;tronger than the invitation to the Scots in 1639; for, though their army may he regarded as foreign, they were &s;ubject<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the &s;ame King, not to in&s;i&s;t on another point of difference; it appears therefore that in this re&s;pect the calling in of the Scots upon the exi&s;ting ne|ce&s;&s;ity was likewi&s;e fully ju&s;tified, and moreover by that of the &s;ub&s;equent in|vitation of the Prince of Orange. The magnitude of the two Revolutions are compared in the next article, wherein it is &s;hewn, that before the claim of the militia in 1641, the Con&s;titution had been rendered in principle and ef|fect more popular than by the Bill of Rights; it was therefore not more con|&s;titutional at that period in the Parliament to take arms, &s;till further to in|crea&s;e the popular power in the Con&s;titution, than it would have been, imme|diately after the pa&s;&s;ing of the Bill of Rights, for the party who invited over the Prince of Orange to have involved the nation in a civil war, to have reduced the kingly power of William to much narrower limits than tho&s;e defined by that great declarative law.</P></NOTE>.

<HEAD>No. IV. A VINDICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ASSO|CIATION OF THE ROYALISTS IN THE CIVIL WARS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is certain that there were great changes wanted in go|vernment when the Parliament of 1640 met; the point to be enquired into therefore is, Whether the amount of the acqui&s;i|tions made by the popular part thereof were not &s;uch, before the King &s;et up his &s;tandard, and the Royali&s;ts pledged them&s;elves to him in the defence of his remaining prerogatives, that no|thing farther was requi&s;ite, unattainable in the ordinary cour&s;e of legi&s;lation without civil war. It is contended here, that the King's conce&s;&s;ions had effectively formed a new con&s;titution of government, although no experiment was &s;uffered to be made of it: which Con&s;titution was at lea&s;t as popular as was nece&s;|&s;ary, to the enjoyment of the freedom compatible with a mixed monarchy.</P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid, <Q>that this que&s;tion is of the nature of tho&s;e concerning the degree in which a certain quality is found re&s;ident in its &s;ubject; which, as it is capable of infinite variations, can|not be defined by language, although it may be the object of
<PB N="125" REF="131">perception; much le&s;s can we determine and de&s;cribe with pre|ci&s;ion, that very degree of any quality which carries its &s;ubject to the highe&s;t perfection of its nature, as far as it depends thereon, or to an a&s;&s;igned point towards it: in &s;hort, that the que&s;tion here propo&s;ed is incapable of any accurate deci&s;ion, as all that can be urged on either &s;ide mu&s;t be drawn from general topics of declamation, and what they can furni&s;h upon this head was exhau&s;ted at the time the Civil Wars were a recent &s;ub|ject.</Q></P>
<P>BUT no age is perhaps competent to decide on all the doubt|ful but important points which may ari&s;e in it. Even the expe|rience of facts to take place in the cour&s;e of the next century, if we were ma&s;ters of it, might give us certainty now in many points, in which we lo&s;e our&s;elves in vague declamation, and the lap&s;e of time has enabled us to di&s;cu&s;s this que&s;tion upon ade|quate experience.</P>
<P>WHEN a Con&s;titution has been tried for a century, and we find by the experience of the whole term that it contains the popular principle in a due proportion, we have therein a fixed &s;tandard to judge another Con&s;titution by; and if we find the fundamental principles of the latter more popular than tho&s;e of the former, we are intitled to pronounce, that upon trial, it would have been found at lea&s;t fully adequate to &s;upport the freedom of the people.</P>
<P>Now on this &s;ubject we po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a &s;tandard of compari&s;on. We find it in that great declaratory Act, the Bill of Rights, which perpetuated to the popular part of the con&s;titution of govern|ment, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every right requi&s;ite for the enjoyment of true liberty, or a&s;&s;erted &s;uch powers to belong thereunto, that whatever farther was wanted was ea&s;ily acquired in the regular and ordinary cour&s;e of legi&s;lation: a bill, by the operation of which the proportion of the two rival powers, the monarchical and the popular, has become &s;o nicely adju&s;ted, that they have been pre&s;erved ever &s;ince in an equilibrio &s;o nice, that the fine&s;t index has, in very few in&s;tances, been able to point out the &s;lighte&s;t vibration in the balance, much le&s;s has it been &s;ubject to tho&s;e violent and alternate exaltations and depre&s;&s;ions of prero|gative and privilege, which in the la&s;t century &s;o often threaten|ed over&s;et it.</P>
<P>IF, therefore, it can be &s;hewn, that the popular part of the Con&s;titution was &s;tronger, after the conce&s;&s;ions of Charles, and before the la&s;t demands were made upon him, which were re|&s;i&s;ted by arms, than the authors of the Bill of Rights cho&s;e to render it; then the Royali&s;ts, who pledged them&s;elves to the maintenance of all the laws and con&s;titutions already pa&s;&s;ed in that Parliament, and the defence of the royal power &s;o limited, did not endeavour to put a &s;top to the acqui&s;itions of the popular
<PB N="126" REF="132">branch of the Con&s;titution prematurely, or before it had attain|ed a due degree of &s;trength.</P>
<P>WE are now to go into a compari&s;on of the acqui&s;itions of the Parliament of 1640, before the demand of the militia, and &s;ome particulars of the Bill of Rights. And fir&s;t with re&s;pect to the con&s;tituent branches of the Legi&s;lature. The Bi&s;hops votes had been aboli&s;hed by Act of Parliament, whereby the influence of the Crown in the Upper Hou&s;e had been much weakened: the Bill of Rights tacitly admits them. The meetings of Parlia|ment had been made triennial in 1640; by the Bill of Rights it is only enacted, that Parliaments &s;hould be frequently held. It was only by a &s;ub&s;equent &s;tatute, pa&s;&s;ed in the 6th year of the reign of William, "that this indefinite frequency was again re|duced to a certainty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black. Com. v. i. p. 153.</NOTE>." And among the Acts of Parliament of Charles, to the &s;upport of which the Royali&s;ts had pledged them&s;elves, was that which ordained that the Parliament then &s;itting &s;hould not be prorogued or di&s;&s;olved but by its own con|&s;ent. Hence the King's power in the legi&s;lature was left much &s;tronger by the Bill of Rights than by the Acts of 1640; and the authors of that Bill declined to pre&s;cribe tho&s;e limitations of kingly power in this re&s;pect, which the Royali&s;ts engaged them|&s;elves to &s;upport.</P>
<P>THE remaining heads of this compari&s;on will relate to the executive power of the Crown, judicial and military: and fir&s;t, as to the independence of the courts of law on the per&s;onal will of the Sovereign. At the reque&s;t of his Parliament, Charles had called in all the Judges patents, and i&s;&s;ued to them new ones "during good behaviour." His two &s;ucce&s;&s;ors re|&s;tored the old form in the&s;e in&s;truments: the Judges again held their offices, "during their good plea&s;ure;" and the Bill of Rights made no alteration therein. The form adapted by Charles the Fir&s;t on the application of his Parliament, was afterwards re&s;tored by 13 Will. III. c. 2. The Royali&s;ts therefore had ad|mitted &s;tronger limitations on the King in his judicial capacity, than tho&s;e great men who effected the Revolution cho&s;e to im|po&s;e upon him.</P>
<P>IT remains to examine, how the King's military powers were left &s;tanding upon both the&s;e grounds. By the Bill of Rights, to keep up a &s;tanding army in time of peace, without the con|&s;ent of Parliament, was declared to be illegal; but before the rupture, the Long Parliament had e&s;tabli&s;hed a precedent, which went much farther. The King offered to rai&s;e ten thou&s;and vo|lunteers for the &s;ervice of the Iri&s;h wars: the Commons put a negative upon this, and to the right of the Parliament to a ne|gative in this point he tacitly &s;ubmitted, by a&s;&s;enting to a Bill to
<PB N="127" REF="133">rai&s;e men upon the authority of that a&s;&s;embly; and by this Act, the pre&s;&s;ing of men by royal warrant was declared to be illegal. The practice was afterwards revived, and by the Bill of Rights no provi&s;ion was made again&s;t it: &s;o much le&s;s were the limita|tions of the Crown declared by that Act, than tho&s;e the a&s;&s;o|ciated Royali&s;ts engaged to maintain the ob&s;ervance of; they therefore agreed to &s;upport the national liberties in greater &s;trength than the authors of the Bill of Rights thought proper to declare for. The merits of the&s;e excellent men &s;tand between the Royali&s;ts and all cen&s;ure, and that Act it&s;elf is a redoubt, which mu&s;t be levelled to the ground before their a&s;&s;ailants can march forward to attack the principles of their A&s;&s;ociation. It is a work they mu&s;t not leave behind them.</P>
<P>AN objection may be made to this, <Q>that the feudal tenures were not aboli&s;hed, nor the Habeas Corpus pa&s;&s;ed, until the Re|&s;toration.</Q> To this it is an&s;wered, that they might both have been obtained without a civil war, either by compact or the ordinary cour&s;e of legi&s;lation. It is true, the revenue from the wards of the Crown, and &s;ome other feudal incidents, remained. The&s;e were compounded for &s;oon after the Re&s;toration, and Charles and the Royali&s;ts would have willingly concurred in their abolition on the &s;ame terms; for the fir&s;t propo&s;ition on this ac|count came from the Crown to the Parliament in the reign of James the Fir&s;t, who offered to give them up for an adequate tax on the lands out of which &s;uch contingent payments i&s;&s;ued: Charles the Fir&s;t would, without doubt, have exchanged them for the hereditary exci&s;e, and the additional recompence after|ward obtained for them by his &s;on; and his party certainly would not have engaged in the dangers of a Civil War to avoid exo|nerating their e&s;tates of tho&s;e payments on the like advantageous terms to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT is to be remarked al&s;o, that in the Parliament of 1640, an Act had already pa&s;&s;ed, "That if any per&s;on be re&s;trained of his liberty by any illegal court, or by command of the King's Maje&s;ty in per&s;on, or by warrant of the council-board, or of any of the Privy Council<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black. Com. v. i. p. 135.</NOTE>," he &s;hould be entitled to a writ of Habeas Corpus. From the temper of the times in which this Act was obtained, it certainly went as far as the experience of the pa&s;t, or the fore&s;ight of the future grievances of arbitrary impri&s;on|ment could then extend, and it is not credible that the improve|ments afterward ingrafted upon it exi&s;ted even in contempla|tion.</P>
<P>THE &s;tatute called by way of eminence the Habeas Corpus Act, pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of Charles the Second. It points out
<PB N="128" REF="134">the means of obtaining this writ more clearly, and enforces them more &s;trongly; but the weakne&s;&s;es of the provi&s;ions of the former were certainly unknown in 1640, as no experience could have been had of them between the time of this Act pa&s;&s;ing, and the breaking out of the Civil War. But if they had then been &s;u&s;|pected, it is ea&s;y to prove they would have been provided for with facility; for the Parliament had fallen upon the practice of granting the tonnage and poundage from time to time, and for terms of a few months only. A more permanent &s;ettlement of it would, in his own e&s;teem, have been a very liberal price, for adding to the Habeas Corpus Act he had already granted what was wanted to give full effect to the &s;pirit of it; which is proved from this circum&s;tance: Charles the Second pa&s;&s;ed this Act long after this revenue was &s;ettled on him for life, without obtaining any &s;upply to the nece&s;&s;ities in which he was then involved.</P>
<P>A FURTHER confirmation of the facility with which the&s;e &s;a|lutary Acts might have been obtained, appears in the hi&s;torians of this period. They inform us, that before any &s;ignal rever&s;e of fortune checked the progre&s;s of the arms of Charles, he appears to have been prepared to have made any conce&s;&s;ion of this kind that might have been judged nece&s;&s;ary. The&s;e &s;entiments he de|clared in a manner which &s;hews be&s;ide that they had the concur|rence of him party; for about the end of December 1643, in his &s;ummons to the Oxford Parliament, be expre&s;&s;es his de&s;ire that "his &s;ubjects &s;hould be confirmed in tho&s;e rights which he had granted them in Parliament, and his readine&s;s <HI>to add &s;uch new grace</HI> as he &s;hould find would mo&s;t conduce to their happine&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neale's Hi&s;tory of Puritans, v. iii. p. 106. from Grey's Examination, p. 119.</NOTE>." The&s;e are very large conce&s;&s;ions to have obtained the&s;e laws; the Royali&s;ts would have thought the purcha&s;e high enough: and &s;o far forth as the liberties of the people and the crown revenues are concerned in &s;uch a compact, they would have &s;tood exactly on the &s;ame footing as they did in the reign of William, after the Revo|lution was duly con&s;olidated.</P>
<P>BUT no doubt can be entertained that the Parliament of Charles the Fir&s;t would have attained the&s;e points in the ordinary and le|gi&s;lative cour&s;e of proceeding. The King and the Royali&s;ts had given a firm engagement, that that a&s;&s;embly &s;hould retain all its new-acquired powers. At the Re&s;toration they cea&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s them, yet the popular con&s;tituent part of the Legi&s;lature, thus weakened, was able to obtain them; if, therefore, the a&s;&s;embly at We&s;tmin&s;ter, giving up all their la&s;t demands upon the King, had concurred with the Royali&s;ts upon the terms of their decla|ration, they would have been able to have given to England a Con&s;titution at lea&s;t as free as is con&s;i&s;tent with limited monarchy, or has ever been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in this country; and a &s;y&s;tem of laws,

<P>THE per&s;onal hi&s;tory of Cromwell from the time in which he ro&s;e into con&s;picuous eminence, is a legitimate part of the hi&s;|tory of the nation, great national events having had as full a de|pendence on his mea&s;ures and plans as they ordinarily have upon tho&s;e of lawful princes.

<P>THERE can be nothing more u&s;eful at pre&s;ent than the con&s;ide|ration of his tran&s;actions at that period. It exhibits one con&s;e|quence of the interpo&s;ition of the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people in the tran&s;actions of Government; the degradation of &s;ociety into that melancholy &s;tate in which it re&s;embles the &s;erpent called Am|phi&s;boena: a production of the imagination of the painter or the poet, who&s;e tail is frequently hurried away with an irre&s;i&s;tible propen&s;ity to take the lead of its head.

<P>So early as the &s;iege of Exeter, in the beginning of the year 1646, he had been looking out for a negociation with the King, on the footing of re&s;toring him "to his ju&s;t and ancient rights."

Sir John Barkley, who treated with them on his part, gives abundant te&s;timony to it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ludlow's Memoirs, v. i. p. 200.</NOTE>; and this is further confirmed by their letter to Parliament about a month after the King's removal among them, by which "they avowed the King's cau&s;e to be theirs, and that no &s;ettlement could be hoped for without granting him his ju&s;t rights<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Whitlock's Memoirs, p. 259.

<P>BUT this &s;tate of affairs very &s;oon changed: the King's mo&s;t confidential agent, Mr. A&s;hburnham, declined all communication with the Agitators; although their Leaders had promi&s;ed, if it &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary, to act for the King again&s;t Cromwell<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The gregarian &s;oldiers and gro&s;s of the army is well affected to him, though &s;ome of the chiefe&s;t commander he &s;till avers."

They di&s;claimed all further connection with the King, or with monarchy it&s;elf; de|clared for a Republic, and wore badges of di&s;tinction in their hats.

He immediately determined to give way to a torrent he was unable to &s;tem. The party he made his
<PB N="131" REF="137">peace with was that mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the King. Thus Cromwell him&s;elf was forced from a plan of future greatne&s;s, which he had been two years bringing to maturity, and, for a time, &s;unk into an in&s;trument in the hands of a military mob. To the faction he made his apology, by acknowledging, <Q>that the glory of the world had &s;o dazzled his eyes, that he could not di&s;cern clearly the great works that the Lord was doing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ludlow, v. 1. p. 229.</NOTE>.</Q> And to the King's friends he alledged, that <Q>it was the act of the Army, and not his own<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Life of O.

<P>I HAVE traced this event with &s;ome minutene&s;s, as it abounds with curious information on the nature and irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e of popular commotions. We &s;ee a military Convention, for a time, rule the State; and &s;oldiers were then the only Citizens. If this &s;ituation of things had continued, and there then exi&s;ted an external force capable of bringing it to an end, the Government of England would have had no remote re&s;emblance to that of Egypt under the Mamalucs. We here &s;ee likewi&s;e the mutabi|lity and dangers of &s;purious repre&s;entations, cho&s;en from the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people: as we find the &s;ame individuals offering to compel their &s;uperiors to re&s;tore the King at one period, and in a very few months after actually compelling them to put an end to his life and the Monarchy. And the failure of Cromwell in his original aim amounts to a proof that it is impo&s;&s;ible, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, for any one, let his natural greatne&s;s be what it may, to conduct any change of government, by the means of popular commotions, to any end by him fore&s;een and predeter|mined. He was able, indeed, to attain afterwards an elevation and greatne&s;s he had probably then never contemplated; but, like Cae&s;ar, he had always, the danger of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination before him; and his apprehen&s;ions of it &s;hew that he had not, in this re&s;pect, the courage of the Roman.</P>

<P>THE Managers of the Hou&s;e of Commons, at the trial of Dr. Sacheverel, contended, that by the Revolution the religion, the

Nor are a &s;eries of acts to be held inimical to a principle, or urged as a precedent or &s;et of precedents again&s;t it, which approximate toils effects, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, in the exi&s;ting circum&s;tances of things, or admit only the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible deviation from it.</P>
<P>THE &s;teps taken at the Revolution to regulate the Succe&s;&s;ion were the following: fir&s;t, The declaration of the abdication, and the con&s;equent vacancy of the Throne; &s;econdly, The limitation of the Crown to Prote&s;tants; thirdly, The placing William on the Throne with Mary; and fourthly, Ve&s;ting the royal power in him for life, in ca&s;e he &s;urvived her. The nece&s;&s;ity of each of the&s;e for the pre&s;ervation of the Monarchy from a very apparent danger then threatening it is to be &s;hewn in order.</P>
<P>FIRST, Men's minds were wrought up to an extraordinary pitch at the time of the Revolution, on the &s;ubject of the danger of the Prote&s;tant religion. The mo&s;t vi&s;ionary fears of an attempt to introduce Popery had always been able to inflame the people to the utmo&s;t. That danger then exi&s;ted, perhaps for the fir&s;t time, &s;ince the reign of Elizabeth, was real and evident. The contro|ver&s;y which had been carried on again&s;t the Roman Church, EXCLUSIVELY by the Clergy of the E&s;tabli&s;hment, with a degree of &s;y&s;tem, of acutene&s;s, and of eloquence, with which it never had been attacked before, by exhibiting its errors in &s;uch &s;trong and multiplied points of view, had excited the minds of the people with new zeal again&s;t the errors of the Romi&s;h Church, and given, collaterally, no &s;mall degree of weight to the popular apprehend|&s;ions of this danger, by that natural operation by which our aver|&s;ion to an object increa&s;es our fear of it. Hence while a Prince of the Papal Communion &s;at upon the Throne the Republicans would have been aided in pulling it down, almo&s;t by the whole popular force. The abdication of James, therefore, pre&s;erved the Mo|narchy from the apparent danger of an almo&s;t immediate &s;ubver|&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="139">SECONDLY, It had al&s;o become nece&s;&s;ary to quiet the alarms of the people, on account of the future dangers of religion, in order to deprive the Republican party entirely of this formidable engine. On this ground, the limitation of the Crown to Prote&s;tants became nece&s;&s;ary for perpetuating Kingly Government.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Other dangers likewi&s;e, from the &s;ame quarter, were &s;ufficient to induce the nation to place William upon the Throne, together with Mary; for a popular revolution always dimini&s;hes the &s;pirit of &s;ubordination; and Government ought always, after &s;uch a &s;hock, to be put in the &s;tronge&s;t &s;tate its Con&s;titution permits, to guard again&s;t all further change. And in this ca&s;e, as the nece&s;&s;ity of having placed the &s;ceptre in William's hand was clearly demon&s;trated by the event, it mu&s;t be taken to have been apparent at the time; for in little more than a year there appeared a nece&s;&s;ity that his whole political vigour &s;hould be armed with the whole kingly power to defeat the attempts of the Republicans in the Commons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;pirit of certain mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by the majority of the Commons in the fir&s;t Parliament of William and Mary has been explained in the Defence of the Letter attributed to Mr. Reeves, p. 72. note.</P></NOTE> to undermine the con&s;titutional powers of the Crown.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, Thus it was evidently requi&s;ite, that during the joint lives of William and Mary the former &s;hould be inve&s;ted with the whole royal power. It is now to be &s;hewn, that there was a very probable nece&s;&s;ity to induce the Convention to leave the kingly power to William for life. A &s;trong ca&s;e in point plainly indicated that nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>IN the reign of Henry of Ca&s;tile, Ferdinand, then Prince of Arragon, had married the King's &s;i&s;ter I&s;abella without his con&s;ent. During his reign he regarded his brother-in-law as &s;ecretly plot|ting to deprive him of his Throne. His Queen had brought him a daughter, who&s;e name was Joanna, to whom a large party of his &s;ubjects believed his favourite, Count Bertran de la Cueva, to have been the real father<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Guicciardini mentions her only by the name of a Bertramiglia; a name, I &s;uppo&s;e, of contempt, given her by the party of Ferdinand in Spain, and de|rived from that of her putative father.</P></NOTE>: and King Henry, who was &s;uppo&s;ed incapable of begetting children, was accu&s;ed of having encouraged the adultery of his wife, in order to impo&s;e a &s;purious &s;ucce&s;&s;or upon his people.</P>
<P>ON the death of Henry, a large party declared for the Prince&s;s I&s;abella his &s;i&s;ter, who after a &s;hort conte&s;t was e&s;tabli&s;hed on the Throne. Many of the Nobility were de&s;irous of ve&s;ting the &s;ole admini&s;tration of the kingdom in the Queen; others for allowing to King Ferdinand, her hu&s;band, an extremely limited and &s;ubor|dinate &s;hare therein: thus Ferdinand and I&s;abella were in the &s;ame circum&s;tances as William and Mary about a century after; the
<PB N="134" REF="140">title of Joanna, the &s;uppo&s;ed daughter of Henry, being &s;till pre|ferred by many of their &s;ubjects, and recognized al&s;o by the neighbouring King of Portugal. The &s;imilarity of their conduct was as perfect as that of their &s;ituations: Ferdinand, in this pro&s;|pect of being di&s;appointed in an object with which his ambition had long flattered him, entertained thoughts of returning to his own dominions, rather than be a Sovereign in name only in the now opulent kingdom of Ca&s;tile. But I&s;abella di&s;couraged the party which was de&s;irous of limiting his powers; and her efforts in his favour prevailed: he was admitted to the exerci&s;e of the &s;overeignty jointly and equally with her.</P>
<P>Two other circum&s;tances added to this &s;imilitude of the &s;itu|ations of the joint Sovereigns of Ca&s;tile and of Britain at the&s;e re&s;pective periods. In the former kingdom, <Q>in alm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t all the cities there were factions that kept up a kind of civil war among them&s;elves, without paying any re&s;pect to the laws, or regard to the royal authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Univ. Hi&s;t. v. 17. p. 270.</NOTE>.</Q> The latter had recently been involved in the mo&s;t dangerous internal commotions, in which the &s;pirit of Republicani&s;m, triumphant a few years before, &s;eemed to revive; and the&s;e had been rather imperfectly &s;mo|thered than &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. For &s;o violent were the tumults of the Petitioners and Abhorrers in 1680, that nothing which preceded the Civil Wars (according to the te&s;timony of a cotemporary ob&s;erver<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Coke's Detection.</NOTE>) more &s;trongly pre&s;aged &s;uch a calamity. They con|tinued to the di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament at Oxford. After that period, indeed, a remi&s;&s;ion of the fever of the national &s;pirit took place; but &s;o little re&s;embling a termination of it, that the pro|bability of its breaking out again with additional violence was apparent. In the natural con&s;titution, particular di&s;orders are &s;een to degenerate into others of a different and far more dangerous character: and in Spain the &s;imple &s;pirit of &s;edition (for nothing appeared further at the fir&s;t) became converted afterwards into that of a turbulent democracy; but in England, a large portion of the latter had all along been di&s;cernibly mixed with the other cau&s;es of di&s;&s;ention peculiar to the times. The danger of Eng|land, therefore, from the principles of democracy, was greater at the Revolution than that of Ca&s;tile at the acce&s;&s;ion of Ferdinand, if we had copied the errors of the latter kingdom.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of the new Sovereigns of the two States, with re&s;pect to the national churches, were al&s;o nearly the &s;ame. The Primate of Spain, the Archbi&s;hop of Toledo, had been very active in the party of I&s;abella and Ferdinand, but ultimately e&s;pou&s;ed that of Joanna. The Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury had zealou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the u&s;urpation of James: the event of that oppo&s;ition &s;eems even to have fini&s;hed the alienation of the army and the nation from him, and rai&s;ed that &s;pirit to its ultimate height which produced
<PB N="135" REF="141">the Revolution; but he oppo&s;ed the acce&s;&s;ion of William and Mary. I&s;abella, de&s;irous of conciliating the Bi&s;hop of Toledo to her intere&s;t, &s;et out her&s;elf to make him a vi&s;it at Alcala. He &s;ent her word, that <Q>if &s;he entered the town at one gate he would go out at the other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Univ. Hi&s;t. v. 17. p. 270.</NOTE>.</Q> When Queen Mary, on her arrival in England, &s;ent to Archbi&s;hop Sancroft to reque&s;t his ble&s;&s;ing, his an&s;wer was, that "&s;he &s;hould a&s;k her father's fir&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple, p. 2. 61.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>SUCH were the corre&s;ponding &s;ituations of per&s;ons and circum|&s;tances in the two kingdoms in the&s;e periods: in the fir&s;t of which Ferdinand became King in Ca&s;tile during the life of I&s;abella; they ruled with one title and one power; their names appeared alike to all acts; they received or di&s;patched Amba&s;&s;adors, rai&s;ed armies, and conducted their wars with the &s;ame authority<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Guicciardmi Venet. 1568, p. 170 a.</NOTE> Ferdinand was therefore only joined in the admini&s;tration and title with I&s;abella; the former was exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in William. At the death of Mary, William would therefore have had &s;ome advantages in an attempt to retain his admini&s;tration, if it had been made terminable with her life, which Ferdinand did not po&s;&s;e&s;s. He was loth to retire to his kingdom of Arragon, &s;mall in compari&s;on of that of Ca&s;tile, and where the royal power was extremely more limited by its con&s;titutions and cu&s;toms &Dagger;. There was the &s;ame hazard that William would, with equal reluctance, have de&s;cended from the Throne of Great Britain to retire into Holland, where his power as Stadtholder had begun to totter<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Univ. Hi&s;t. v. 27. p. 321. l. 1. p. 343. l. 10.</NOTE> before he had acquired a Crown.</P>
<P>IN the calamities this arrangement of power at the acce&s;&s;ion of Ferdinand and I&s;abella brought in the event upon Ca&s;tile and all Spain, and the others with which it was threatened, but from which it was providentially delivered, we &s;hall &s;ee a nece&s;&s;ity able to have induced our ance&s;tors to continue William upon the Throne for life. On the arrival of Philip, the hu&s;band of Joanna, daughter of I&s;abella and Ferdinand, who &s;ucceeded to the Throne in her own right on the death of her mother, Ferdinand endeavoured in vain to maintain him&s;elf in the admini&s;tration which he had a&s;&s;umed. He was deprived of it by a very &s;udden Revolution; but had the addre&s;s to &s;tipulate for him&s;elf &s;uch terms as mu&s;t have impoveri&s;hed the kingdom. He &s;oon recovered it by two events equivalent to another. When he was re&s;tored, the &s;trength of Government was not re&s;tored with him: the long delay he affectedly made before his return; the factions occa&s;ioned by the preten&s;ions of his competitor; the ab&s;ence of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or at the time of his death; continued further to enfeeble it: a little after which, a faction of Levellers aro&s;e; the commonalty attacked the Nobility and Gentry, and, for a while, were nearly ma&s;ters of the king|doms<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ib.</NOTE>

And there is much apparent connection, both in time and principle, between this and an in&s;urrection which broke out in his Imperial dominions; that of the Anabapti&s;ts, which de&s;olated &s;everal parts of Germany from 1524 to 1536, in which year Mun&s;ter was reduced.</P>
<P>Some particulars relating to this in&s;urrection of the Anabapti&s;ts are connected with the &s;ubject of this Tract; and I &s;hall give them here, having omitted them in their proper place. Luther wrote his book <HI>De Libertate Chri&s;tiana</HI> (On the Liberty of a Chri&s;tian) in 1520. In this work, in a rhetorical flight which might have been very well &s;pared, he lays it down as a propo&s;ition, that <Q><HI>a Chri&s;tian man is ma&s;ter of everything, and is &s;ubject to no one.</HI></Q> (Bayle, art. "Anabapti&s;ts."). The utmo&s;t fault of this perhaps is, that he attempts to give a fal&s;e elevation to the character of Chri&s;tianity, by one of the <HI>ambitio&s;a ernamenta,</HI> the high-&s;ounding principles of the Stoles, without &s;ufficiently limiting his meaning. The in&s;urrection in the Emperor's dominions in Spain mu&s;t have excited much ferment in the &s;pirit a of the lower order of men in Germany. This facilitated the reception of the interpretation Muncer and his a&s;&s;ociates gave to this propo&s;ition of Luther. When the&s;e incendiaries founded upon it the unqualified rights of the Equality of Man, Luther acted again&s;t them with &s;ingular zeal. The confu&s;ions rai&s;ed by the Anabapti&s;ts in the Empire are entirely a&s;cribed by the Romani&s;ts to the fermentation of the minds of the people of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ower orders in Germany occa&s;ioned by the Reformation. It is much more properly to be called a di&s;ea&s;e of the times, as it broke forth fir&s;t in a country where the faith of the Roman Church had not been attacked, and was excited there by the preaching Friars and Monks. Howell, Hi&s;t.Lewis XIII. p. 128). Everything &s;hews us the migrating nature of the&s;e princi|ples. After having made their fir&s;t appearance in Spain in 1519, their &s;econd in Germany in 1524, and been &s;ubdued there in 1536, they re-appeared in England in 1549, in the reign of Edward the Sixth. Good &s;eldom comes un|mixed. With the truths of the Reformation we were &s;o unfortunate as to import &s;ome of the political fanatici&s;m of Muncer, Storch, and Stubner. This likewi&s;e furni&s;hes another in&s;tance, in addition to the in&s;urrection under Wat Tyler, that it is the nature of this contagion, when it is brought out of one country into another, to lie dormant for &s;ome years before it breaks out; the eruption has always been unprovided for and unexpected. Hence, in all in&s;tances of this kind, we &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of a long continued vigilance again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. in the le&s;t &s;ection but one of the E&s;&s;ay, mention has been made of the 
<PB N="137" REF="143">commotions which broke out in England in 1549: their origin ought to have been traced back to the Continent.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the length this rote has run to, I mu&s;t make the following addition to it. In the &s;econd Article of the Appendix it is ob&s;erved, that the in&s;urrection under Wat Tyler in England, in imitation of that of the Jacquerie in France, prolonged the &s;emi-barbari&s;m of Europe between two and three centuries. And in like manner, the principal cau&s;e which hindered the Reformation being univer&s;al in Chri&s;tendom, involved its profe&s;&s;ors in &s;o many per&s;ecutions, and cau&s;ed &s;o many religious wars, appears to have been the fanatici&s;m of Equality which di&s;graced it almo&s;t at its fir&s;t appearance in Ger|many. "Nothing," &s;ays Guicciardini, <Q>has &s;o much re&s;trained its cour&s;e as the di&s;covery that the followers of this doctrine were not le&s;s ho&s;tile to the power of Princes than to the authority of the Roman Pontiff: by which it has happened, that many Princes have been induced by their intere&s;t to prohibit the entrance of this contagion into their kingdoms with vigilance and &s;everity.</Q> Lib. 13. p. 380. This hi&s;torian died in the &s;pring of the year in which Calvin was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Geneva.

Brantome, Bayle, and Foulis, have each quoted it at length from Sandoval.</P></NOTE>.</Q> It con|tinued from 1510 to 1521.</P>
<P>THUS the exi&s;tence of Monarchy was hazarded in Spain by the jealou&s;y of the Ca&s;tilians, who, when they con&s;ented to place an effective &s;ceptre in the hand of Ferdinand, made the duration of his reign dependent on the life of his wife. By the conte&s;ts for the &s;upreme power con&s;equent thereupon, the effective inter-reg|nums, and feeble di&s;puted admini&s;trations, the &s;pirit of &s;edition exi&s;ting at his acce&s;&s;ion ultimately became heightened into that of a turbulent democracy. With a liberal policy, and in effect more favourable to Monarchy, our ance&s;tors conferred the Crown on William for life. Republicani&s;m had been &s;ubdued in England

<P>I REPEAT here what is laid down at the beginning of this arti|cle, that the Revolution was ju&s;tified by a threefold nece&s;&s;ity: That of the pre&s;ervation of our religion; and that <Q>of recovering the regal power, and the rights of the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll.</NOTE>.</Q> It is the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued for the &s;econd purpo&s;e which are here exclu|&s;ively con&s;idered. The nece&s;&s;ity then exi&s;ting of a Revolution to recover the rights of the people is a different &s;ubject, and to be proved from different topics. What I had thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay on that branch of this compound &s;ubject<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 71, 72. 73, 74.</NOTE> is contained in my Defence of the Letter attributed to Mr. Reeves.</P>
