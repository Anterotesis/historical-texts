<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE character of archbi&s;hop Cran|mer hath been equally the &s;ubject of exaggerated prai&s;e; and of un|de&s;erved cen&s;ure. The prote&s;tant is as little inclined to acknowledge, that he had any failing; as the papi&s;t is to allow him any virtue. The hi&s;torian therefore, who means to be impartial, will often of cour&s;e, give offence to the warmer advocates of both &s;ides.</P>
<P>At the hazard however of this I have endeavoured to do ju&s;tice as well to the failings, as virtues of this celebrated re|former.
<PB N="ii" REF="4">Every cau&s;e, in which truth is concerned, is the better, I &s;hould think, for having all things but truth &s;ifted from it. And in di&s;criminating the lights and &s;hades of a character, the greater the cha|racter is, the nicer &s;hould be the di&s;cri|mination: for the very foibles of an ami|able man are fa&s;cinating. Queen Eliza|beth u&s;ed to tell the arti&s;ts, who drew her picture, that &s;he did not like &s;hade: it was a mere accident.&mdash;It may be &s;o: but, it is &s;uch an accident, that the truth of portrait cannot be had without it.&mdash;Be&s;ides, by impartial treatment, you add re&s;pect to the character you re|pre&s;ent. General applau&s;e is always &s;u|&s;pected: while ju&s;t cen&s;ure gives weight to prai&s;e.</P>
<P>But the que&s;tion recurs, Is your cen&s;ure ju&s;t?</P>
<P>In cen&s;uring &s;ome parts of the arch|bi&s;hop's conduct, particularly his intole|rant principles, I have little doubt of
<PB N="iii" REF="5">having the general &s;en&s;e of good men on my &s;ide.</P>
<P>As to the indelicacies, and improprie|ties of his behaviour, I can only appeal to my own feelings. What I &s;hould not wi&s;h to approve in my&s;elf, I cannot but cen&s;ure in another. I always however give my rea&s;ons; and if they have no weight, they mu&s;t be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Arch|bi&s;hop Cranmer certainly filled one of the mo&s;t difficult &s;tations, con&s;idering all its circum&s;tances, in which a man could be placed; and the only matter of &s;urprize is, that the fal&s;e &s;teps he made were &s;o few.</P>
<P>One thing more let me add, we &s;hall not ea&s;ily find a character, that can al|low deductions &s;o well. His virtues &s;o far outweigh his failings; that, on the whole, we may e&s;teem him one of the fir&s;t per&s;ons of the age, in which he lived. His public life contains an im|portant part of eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory; and his private life, an admirable le&s;&s;on of
<PB N="iv" REF="6">clerical in&s;truction.&mdash;To this let the mi|ni&s;ters of the go&s;pel chiefly attend; and in&s;tead of thinking too har&s;hly of his failings; let us endeavour to bring as much &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and real concern for chri&s;tianity, as he did, into all the duties, and offices of religion.</P>
<P>In compo&s;ing the following work, I claim little merit, but that of dige&s;ting, and reducing within a narrower compa&s;s, the labours of others. I have had little affi&s;tance except from common printed accounts. The works of Mr. Strype, an hi&s;torian of great integrity, have been my principal guide: who&s;e authority, in doubtful points, I have generally pre|ferred.</P>
<P>In gratitude al&s;o I mu&s;t acknowledge particular obligation to the late Mr. Jones of Welwin; the learned friend, and, (I believe,) the executor, of the celebrated author of the Night-thoughts.&mdash;But I
<PB N="v" REF="7">never was per&s;onally acquainted with him.</P>
<P>This gentleman had once entertained the de&s;ign of writing the life of arch|bi&s;hop Cranmer; and with this inten|tion had made con&s;iderable collections: but laying his de&s;ign aside, he was &s;o obliging as to put his papers, near twenty years ago, into my hands.</P>
<P>We had both, I found, drawn from the &s;ame authorities; only I had the mortification to ob&s;erve, that he had been much the more indu&s;trious compiler. He had al&s;o, through the means of &s;everal of his learned friends at Cambridge, par|ticularly the late Dr. Buker, gained ac|ce&s;s to many &s;ources of information, le&s;s obvious to common inquirers.</P>
<P>Our plans too rather differed. His was chiefly to explain the opinions of the archbi&s;hop: mine attempts rather to il|lu&s;trate his character. Notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="vi" REF="8">however this difference, Mr. Jones's pa|pers were of con&s;iderable u&s;e to me.</P>
<P>I have now depo&s;ited them, agreeably to his la&s;t will, in the library of Dr. Williams in Red-cro&s;s &s;treet, London.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF ARCHBISHOP CRANMER.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>THOMAS CRANMER was born at A&s;lacton in Nottingham&s;hire, on the &s;econd of July 1489. His father was a gentleman of &s;mall fortune; but the head of a family, which had long lived in reputation in tho&s;e parts. He was a lover of country diver&s;ions; and &s;eems to have given his &s;on an early ta&s;te for them.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances indeed of Mr. Cran|mer's youth were not &s;uch, as u&s;ually u&s;her
<PB N="2" REF="16">in the life of a &s;cholar. No man could manage a pack of hounds better; or handle the long-bow with more dexterity; or with the cro&s;s-bow take a &s;urer aim. In hor&s;eman&s;hip he &s;o excelled, that after he was an arch-bi&s;hop, he &s;crupled not to ride the roughe&s;t hor&s;e in his &s;tables.</P>
<P>But amu&s;ements with him were only relaxations. He gave him&s;elf up to &s;tudy with equal eagerne&s;s; and his proficiency in country-diver&s;ions &s;hewed merely the ver&s;atility of his genius.&mdash;The experi|ment, however, is dangerous; and the example not to be followed by tho&s;e, who are not well a&s;&s;ured they have his &s;trength of parts, and &s;teadine&s;s of temper to &s;ecure them from an extreme.</P>
<P>At the u&s;ual age Mr. Cranmer was &s;ent to Cambridge; which was not then the &s;eat of the mu&s;es. Schoolmen were the cla&s;&s;ics of that age; and nothing was heard from the chairs either of &s;cience, or reli|gion, but what would have in&s;pired an improved mind with di&s;gu&s;t. This &s;olemn trifling, which was then called learning, engaged Mr. Cranmer at lea&s;t ten years.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="17">About the year 1520 Martin Luther began fir&s;t to draw the attention of man|kind. Many reformers, before his day, particularly Wicliff, Hu&s;s, and Jerome of Prague, at different periods, had &s;een, and expo&s;ed, with great acutene&s;s, and &s;trength of argument, the corruptions of the church of Rome. But it plea&s;ed God to u&s;e the&s;e inqui&s;itive minds only as the dawning of that day, which He intended gradually to open. The corruptions of the church therefore having not yet re|ceived any effectual check, continued to &s;pread; and, in the days of Luther, had grown to an enormous height. Venality, and rapacity were the reigning character|i&s;tics of the &s;overeign pontiff; and of that band of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who retained under him. The very idea of religion was lo&s;t; except where it was nece&s;&s;ary to uphold &s;ome parading ceremonies of the church; which were all the remains now left of Chri&s;tianity. Morals were never thought of; and &s;o far were the ruling powers from being hurt by the &s;candalous lives
<PB N="4" REF="18">of the clergy, that they invented every method to exempt them from the juri&s;|diction of all courts, except their own. In them, every tre&s;pa&s;s found the gentle&s;t treatment. An ea&s;y fine would &s;atisfy even for murder.</P>
<P>Nor is it &s;urprizing, that the inferior clergy &s;hould lay a&s;ide all decency of man|ners, when they looked up to &s;uch pon|tiffs, as had long filled St. Peter's chair; particularly Alexander VI, and Julius II. Even Leo X, flattered by the wits of the age, as the revivor, and patron of arts, and letters, tho an elegant prince, was a dete&s;table eccle&s;ia&s;tic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They who wi&s;h to &s;ee the cau&s;es, which advanced the reformation, drawn out at length, may find them detailed with great per&s;picuity, and elegance in the life of Charles V. by Dr. Robert&s;on. Vol. II. page 147, oct. ed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We need not wonder therefore, if &s;o complex a &s;y&s;tem of corruption, as the Roman hierarchy appears to have been, at that time, needed little developing. Lu|ther's doctrines &s;pread rapidly through Ger|many: and tho it was the &s;ingle corruption of indulgences, which gave the fir&s;t im|pul&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="19">to this di&s;gu&s;t; yet from one error the minds of men pre&s;ently pa&s;&s;ed to ano|ther; and the tenets of Luther were eager|ly embraced, not only by the lower cla&s;&s;es of people; but even by &s;ome of the princes of the empire; particularly by the elector of Saxony, one of the be&s;t, and by his &s;ufferings &s;hewn to be, one of the mo&s;t magnanimous, princes of his time.</P>
<P>But tho the ardent, and intrepid &s;pirit of Luther had thus awakened a great part of Germany from its lethargy; yet his opinions found their way but lei&s;urely into other parts of Europe. In England they were received with great caution. Serious men began to &s;ee the corruptions of the clergy; but they were afraid to que&s;tion the infallibility of the pope. They were convinced of the propriety of &s;eeking truth in the bible: but examined with great timidity the doctrines it contained.</P>
<P>Indeed, as far as appears, the writings of Era&s;mus introduced the fir&s;t idea of &s;y&s;|tematic reformation in England. This reformer was a man of a very different temper from Luther: and yet in his way perhaps he contributed as much to di&s;|countenance
<PB N="6" REF="20">the corruptions of the Romi&s;h church. Luther, fearle&s;s in the path of truth, was animated, rather than daunted, by oppo&s;ition. Era&s;mus, cautious, and re&s;pectful to authority, &s;hrank from dan|ger; and &s;ought truth only in the regions of tranquillity. Luther, in vehement lan|guage, talked of extirpating error, root, and branch. Era&s;mus wi&s;hed only to open the eyes of men; and to leave them by degrees to reform them&s;elves: he &s;atisfied him&s;elf with expo&s;ing what was wrong; but did not pre&s;ume to point out what was right. Luther's oppo&s;ition ran ever in the form of fierce invective, or &s;erious argument. Era&s;mus, tho always in earne&s;t, cho&s;e commonly to cloath his &s;entiments in ridicule. Luther was re|markable for the boldne&s;s of his mea|&s;ures; and a cour&s;e of intrepid action: while Era&s;mus, tru&s;ting to his pen, never ventured abroad as the champion of reli|gion; but defended it from his clo&s;et: and the art of printing getting then into u&s;e, his opinions &s;oon made their way into the different parts of Europe.</P>
<P>Thus it happened, through the provi|dence of God, that the&s;e two men, tho
<PB N="7" REF="21">in different ways, were equally adapted to the work of reformation. If Luther were the more &s;pirited reformer on the &s;pot; Era&s;mus was better qualified to make pro|&s;elytes at a di&s;tance. If Luther's rough, and popular addre&s;s were better &s;uited to the multitude; the poli&s;hed &s;tyle, and elegant compo&s;ition of Era&s;mus, found readier acce&s;s to the gentleman, and the &s;cholar.</P>
<P>The works of this celebrated writer be|gan to be received in England at the time, when Mr. Cranmer was a &s;tudent at Cam|bridge; and all men, who pretended to genius, learning, or liberality of &s;enti|ment, read them with avidity. To the general &s;cholar, they opened a new idea&mdash;that of thinking for him&s;elf; and to the &s;tudent in divinity, they pointed out the &s;criptures as the only &s;ource of religious truth. The &s;ophi&s;try of the &s;chools be|gan apace to lo&s;e credit; and the univer|&s;ities &s;oon produced ingenious men, who thought they could not employ their time
<PB N="8" REF="22">better, than in &s;tudying the naked text of the &s;criptures, which at length drew on a freedom of inquiry. The&s;e &s;tudents were commonly known by the name of Scrip|turi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Mr. Cranmer ranked him&s;elf very early in this cla&s;s of men; and with great a&s;&s;i|duity applied to the &s;tudy of the &s;crip|tures. The more he &s;tudied, the more inlightened he grew: he daily &s;aw more rea&s;on for rejecting the fal&s;e aids, in which he con&s;ided; and began to entertain many doubts, and &s;u&s;picions, which he yet kept to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His mode of &s;tudy was calculated for improvement, rather than for o&s;tentation. He read few books; but made him&s;elf a thorough ma&s;ter of tho&s;e, he did read. A general &s;cholar he thought another name for a &s;uperficial one. His character as a &s;tudent, is thus marked by one of his biographers. "In percurrendis, confe|rendi&s;que &s;criptorum judiciis, tardus qui|dem lector, &s;ed vehemens erat ob&s;ervator. Sine calamo nunquam ad &s;criptoris cujus|quam librum acce&s;&s;it: ita tamen ut me|moriam
<PB N="9" REF="23">interim, haud minus quam cala|mum, exerceret<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melch. Adam vitae Theol.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>An imprudent marriage, at this early period of his life, interrupted his &s;tudies; and threw him out of his preferment in Je&s;us college; of which he had been elected a fellow. He was now reduced to difficult circum&s;tances. The &s;lender income of a lecture&s;hip, which he obtain|ed in Magdalen college, &s;eems to have been the whole of what he now enjoyed. But tho it produced him little emolu|ment, it tended greatly to increa&s;e his reputation. His lectures, which were con&s;idered as ingenious, and learned com|po&s;itions, were always attended by a nu|merous academical audience of every de|&s;cription. They were chiefly directed again&s;t the Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;titions. "He rubbed the galled backs, &s;ays Fuller, and curried the lazy hides of many an idle, and ignorant frier." I know not that the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions give us a ju&s;t idea of
<PB N="10" REF="24">Mr. Cranmer's talents. They imply a &s;arca&s;tic manner, which was not his. Strong &s;en&s;e, and argument were the only weapons he employed.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce been married a year, when his wife died: and &s;uch was his reputation in the univer&s;ity, and particu|larly in his own college, that, on this event, he was re-elected into his former &s;tation.</P>
<P>He had &s;oon an opportunity of &s;hewing his gratitude. Some agents of cardinal Wool&s;ey being employed to draw together a body of learned men from both the uni|ver&s;ities to fill the college of Chri&s;t-church in Oxford, which that prelate had ju&s;t founded; Mr. Cranmer, among others, was applied to; but he did not care to leave his old friends, to whom he had been lately &s;o much obliged; tho a better income was offered, and a more promi&s;ing road to preferment.</P>
<P>In the year 1526 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype is mi&s;taken in fixing it in 1523.</NOTE> he took the degree of doctor in divinity. The &s;cripturi&s;ts, it is evident, had great influence in the
<PB N="11" REF="25">univer&s;ity at this time; as we find Dr. Cranmer appointed one of the examiners in theology.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he did very eminent &s;ervice to religion by allowing no &s;tudent to proceed to his degree, who did not ap|pear to be well acquainted with the &s;crip|tures. His &s;trictne&s;s however was tem|pered with &s;o much gentlene&s;s, and be|nignity; that the di&s;appointed candidate, unle&s;s a very di&s;ingenuous man, plainly &s;aw, that the examiner's con&s;cience drew from him a reluctant &s;everity.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity however &s;oon felt the good effects of Dr. Cranmer's attention. The young divines caught a new object of pur&s;uit; and intirely changed their mode of &s;tudy. He would often afterwards &s;ay, that in the cour&s;e of his life, he had met with many eminent &s;cholars, who had told him with great ingenuity, how much they thought them&s;elves obliged to him for the check he had formerly given them at Cambridge, "Had it not been for that, they would add, we might have per&s;i&s;ted, all our lives, in our early prejudices."</P>

<P>While Dr. Cranmer was thus em|ployed, about the year 1529, an epi|demical di&s;temper, attended with many &s;ymptoms like the plague, broke out at Cambridge. A great alarm was &s;pread: the &s;chools were &s;hut up, and every man endeavoured to provide for his own &s;afety by flight. Dr. Cranmer retired into E&s;&s;ex, to the hou&s;e of Mr. Cre&s;&s;y, a gentle|man of fortune at Waltham; who&s;e &s;ons had been his pupils at Cambridge; and who&s;e education he &s;till continued to &s;u|perintend. The&s;e circum&s;tances were the foundation of all his future fortunes.</P>
<P>That great eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;e, king Henry's divorce, was at this time in agi|tation. The legatine court, which &s;hould have decided that bu&s;ine&s;s, was ju&s;t di&s;|&s;olved,
<PB N="13" REF="27">and had left the affair in its old uncertainty.</P>
<P>Henry's devotion to the See of Rome had made him thus far &s;ubmit with pa|tience to its delays. But his eyes were now in a great mea&s;ure opened. He be|gan to &s;ee that Clement, who&s;e. character was a compound of di&s;&s;imulation and ti|midity, had been acting a double part; and that while he openly pretended every thing in favour of the divorce, he was in fact no other than the dupe of the emperor. With this clue the Engli&s;h mini&s;try was able to unravel the mazes of the pope's duplicity: and this la&s;t affair, the di&s;&s;olu|tion of the legatine court, and the avocation of the cau&s;e to Rome, after &s;o many af|fected delays, at length convinced even Henry him&s;elf, that the pope meant no|thing in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>While the monarch, vexed at this new di&s;appointment, was revolving in his mind the indignities he had &s;uffered, he relaxed him&s;elf with a &s;hort journey, <HI>or progre&s;s</HI> (as the&s;e journeys were then called) through &s;ome of the &s;outhern counties. On his return, he &s;pent a night at Waltham;
<PB N="14" REF="28">where his retinue, as was u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions, were lodged among the neigh|bouring gentlemen. Fox, provo&s;t of King's college in Cambridge, and Gardiner, af|terwards the celebrated bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, then attended the king; and were invited, with &s;ome others, to the hou&s;e of Mr. Cre&s;&s;y, where they pa&s;&s;ed the even|ing with Dr. Cranmer. The conver&s;ation turned on the only topic, which was then di&s;cu&s;&s;ed among courtiers, the unhand|&s;ome behaviour of the court of Rome: and on all &s;ides, the pope's di&s;&s;imulation, and the king's forbearance, were &s;poken of, with acrimony, and admiration.</P>
<P>Dr. Cranmer, who &s;eemed to have di|ge&s;ted the whole bu&s;ine&s;s in his mind, &s;aid, he thought a method might be pur|&s;ued, which would tend to bring the matter to a happy i&s;&s;ue. When all with great eagerne&s;s de&s;ired to know, what he meant, he told them, his idea was, to col|lect: the opinions of all the univer&s;ities in Europe on this &s;imple que&s;tion, Whether it was lawful to marry a brother's wife? Their approbation of the marriage, he &s;aid, would &s;atisfy the king's &s;cruples; or
<PB N="15" REF="29">their di&s;approbation of it would bring the pope to a deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Dr. Cranmer's opinion &s;eemed very plau&s;ible both to Fox, and Gardiner; who failed not, the next morning, to mention it to the king. It &s;truck Henry at once; who with that indelicacy which was na|tural to him, cried out with an oath, that "Cranmer had gotten the right &s;ow by the ear."</P>
<P>He was immediately &s;ent for; and had a long conference with the king; which ended in Henry's commands to put his &s;entiments in writing, both with regard to the divorce it&s;elf; and the manner in which he propo&s;ed to conduct it.</P>
<P>The great merit of Dr. Cranmer's pro|po&s;al, which is not immediately evident, &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t, not &s;o much in changing the judges, as in narrowing the que&s;tion. In&s;tead of inquiring, whether the pope's di&s;pen&s;ation gave legality to Henry's mar|riage with his brother's wife? he wi&s;hed to inquire &s;imply, Whether &s;uch a mar|riage was not contradictory to the divine commands? If the univer&s;ities deter|mined, that it was not &s;o, the king mu&s;t then give up his &s;cruples, and keep his
<PB N="16" REF="30">wife. Of this however he was under no apprehen&s;ion. But if the univer&s;ities de|termined, that &s;uch a marriage was un|lawful; the king might then, if the pope were refractory, do without him; &s;aying, the marriage was in it&s;elf null.</P>
<P>Henry therefore being re&s;olved to adopt this new plan, began next to adju&s;t the proper mode of executing it. He read Dr. Cranmer's papers with great atten|tion; and was per&s;uaded, that he, who had &s;hewn him&s;elf &s;o much a ma&s;ter of the ca&s;e, was the only per&s;on, in who&s;e management of it, he could thoroughly confide. At the &s;ame time he thought an ob&s;cure eccle&s;ia&s;tic had not dignity of cha|racter enough to repre&s;ent his per&s;on abroad. He joined therefore in com|mi&s;&s;ion with him the earl of Wilt&s;hire, and the bi&s;hop of London; recommend|ing him, in a particular manner, to the friend&s;hip of the former.</P>
<P>The earl of Wilt&s;hire, with whom Dr. Cranmer ever afterwards maintained a &s;trict friend&s;hip, was one of the greate&s;t ornaments of the Engli&s;h court. In a public character he had appeared to ad|vantage,
<PB N="17" REF="31">once in Spain, and a &s;econd time in Germany. At home he had borne with equal credit, the offices of trea&s;urer of the hou&s;e-hold, and lord privy &s;eal. In private life, his manners were very amiable. He was one of the mo&s;t learned men of his age; and one of the be&s;t phi|lo&s;ophers: and tho a courtier, and a &s;tate&s;man, had employed much of his time in the &s;tudy of the &s;criptures, which he made the rule of his life. To his re|que&s;t it was owing, that Era&s;mus com|po&s;ed his valuable treati&s;e on a preparation for death. But what &s;till made this ex|cellent man more celebrated than all his virtues, was his being the father of Ann Bolleyn; who was, at this time, well known to be the intended con&s;ort of Henry.</P>
<P>In the year 1530 the three commi&s;|&s;ioners &s;et out on this extraordinary occa|&s;ion; bending their cour&s;e fir&s;t to Italy, where they found &s;ucce&s;s in &s;ome of the univer&s;ities, which were even dependent
<PB N="18" REF="32">on the pope. Dr. Cranmer offered to di&s;pute the matter fairly in the Rota.</P>
<P>The pope, at fir&s;t, was very angry; declaring to tho&s;e about him, that he would not &s;uffer his power to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by friers; alluding probably to the un|dignified character of Dr. Cranmer. But finding afterwards of what con&s;e|quence he was, he became very de&s;irous of attaching him to his intere&s;t; and with this view conferred on him the office of penitentiary-general of England, with full powers to bind and loo&s;e. Dr. Cran|mer could not avoid accepting the pope's favour; but as it was a power he never meant to u&s;e, he con&s;idered it as a very in&s;ignificant &s;ine-cure.</P>
<P>At the end of the fir&s;t year, the three delegates having traver&s;ed the univer&s;ities of Italy, the commi&s;&s;ion was di&s;&s;olved; and a new one made out, directed &s;olely to Dr. Cranmer, who was &s;tiled Con&s;ili|arius regis, et ad Cae&s;arem orator. It bears date January 24, 1531. No di&s;gu&s;t &s;eems to have been taken at the other commi&s;&s;ioners; but as Dr. Cranmer was the per&s;on, on whom the king chiefly
<PB N="19" REF="33">relied, it is probable he had from the fir&s;t, determined to intru&s;t the matter &s;olely to him, as &s;oon as his character had acquired a little con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Very great &s;ucce&s;s attended his com|mi&s;&s;ion. Few &s;cruples were rai&s;ed; and he had little more to do, than to collect the hands and &s;eals of &s;uch univer&s;ities, as favoured the king's intentions; which were, on the matter, almo&s;t all he ap|plied to.</P>
<P>This expedition &s;o readily projected, and &s;o chearfully undertaken, does not perhaps place Dr. Cranmer in the mo&s;t advantageous point of light. There were good political rea&s;ons, no doubt, to in|duce the king to wi&s;h for a divorce. His marriage with Catharine was by no means generally approved, either at home, or abroad: the legitimacy of Mary, in trea|ties of marriage with neighbouring princes, had been que&s;tioned; and the terrible effects of the late civil wars in England, occa&s;ioned by di&s;puted titles, were wounds not yet intirely healed. Male i&s;&s;ue to the
<PB N="20" REF="34">king, which might prevent &s;uch con&s;e|quences, was therefore very de&s;ireable to all men.</P>
<P>But rea&s;ons of &s;tate, however admi&s;&s;ible in a cabinet, &s;hould never be &s;uppo&s;ed to influence a churchman. We allow, that Dr. Cranmer might think the marriage wrong: but tho it po&s;&s;ibly might be a point of con&s;cience with the king, it could however be none with him; and there was manife&s;tly a difference between ad|vi&s;ing not to do a thing; and advi&s;ing to undo it, when already done; at lea&s;t in a matter of &s;o di&s;putable a nature. He knew, that, in the old te&s;tament, the marriage of a &s;i&s;ter was allowed; and among the patriarchs often practi&s;ed: and that the marriage of a brother's wife was, in &s;ome ca&s;es, enjoined. The new te&s;ta|ment was &s;ilent on the &s;ubject. There could therefore be no moral turpitude in it: nor any thing but the common law, and u&s;age of nations to re&s;train it.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the ba&s;ene&s;s, and ungenerous behaviour, which followed the contrary part, were evident at &s;ight. To repudiate a woman, with whom the king
<PB N="21" REF="35">had cohabited near twenty years as his wife; and to illegitimate a daughter, bred up in the highe&s;t expectations, and now marriagable, were acts of &s;uch cruelty, that it &s;eems to indicate a want of feeling to be in any degree acce&s;&s;ory to them. To this may be added, that the notoriety of the king's pa&s;&s;ion for Ann Bolleyn, which all men believed to be&mdash;if not the fir&s;t mover, at lea&s;t the principal &s;pring of his pretended &s;cruples, threw a very indelicate imputation on all who had any concern in the affair. No &s;erious churchman, one would imagine, could be fond of the idea of admini&s;tring to the king's pa&s;&s;ions. It is with concern there|fore that we &s;ee a man of Dr. Cranmer's integrity and &s;implicity of manners, act|ing &s;o much out of character, as to com|pound an affair of this kind, if not with his con&s;cience, at lea&s;t with all delicacy of &s;entiment; and to parade through Europe, in the quality of an amba&s;&s;ador, defending every where the king's <HI>pious in|tentions.</HI></P>
<P>But the cau&s;e animated him. With the illegality of the king's marriage, he en|deavoured
<PB N="22" REF="36">virtually to e&s;tabli&s;h the in&s;uf|ficiency of the pope's di&s;pen&s;ation; and the latter was an argument &s;o near his heart, that it &s;eems to have added merit to the former. We cannot indeed ac|count for his embarking &s;o zealou&s;ly in this bu&s;ine&s;s, without &s;uppo&s;ing his prin|cipal motive was to free his country from the tyranny of Rome, to which this &s;tep very evidently led. So de&s;ireable an end would, in &s;ome degree, he might ima|gine, &s;anctify the means.</P>
<P>This was not the only foreign bu&s;ine&s;s in which Dr. Cranmer was employed. He was intru&s;ted with many private di&s;|patches from the king. He had matters of trade al&s;o to negotiate for the mer|chants of England. Once he was obliged to furni&s;h him&s;elf with camp-equipage, and attend the emperor, who had taken the field again&s;t the Turks. In every em|ployment he &s;hewed him&s;elf to be a man, who&s;e knowledge was by no means totally confined to his profe&s;&s;ion; but was of a
<PB N="23" REF="37">more general ca&s;t, than the &s;implicity of his character led men to &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>If Dr. Cranmer began to think favour|ably of the reformation before he left Eng|land, he became during his &s;tay abroad, an intire convert. That freedom, with which men di&s;cu&s;&s;ed religious opinions in Germany, was very agreeable to a man of his liberal turn; and he felt him&s;elf every day &s;itting loo&s;er to tho&s;e prejudices, which had hitherto involved him. O&s;i|ander, whom he found at Nuremburgh, contributed, among others, very much to inlighten his mind. The unre&s;trained conver&s;ation of this reformer appeared to him, at fir&s;t, as a kind of libertini&s;m: it &s;ounded har&s;hly in his ear; and he would a&s;k, if &s;uch an opinion were fal&s;e, how it could po&s;&s;ibly po&s;&s;e&s;s it&s;elf of the minds of the greate&s;t, and mo&s;t learned men of all ages, through &s;uch a tract of time? O&s;iander carried him boldly &s;till higher into antiquity. Tell me not, &s;aid he, what Au&s;tin &s;ays, and Jerome; but what Peter &s;ays, and Paul. Read your bible;
<PB N="24" REF="38">and &s;ay hone&s;tly, whether &s;uch and &s;uch doctrines are not plainly repugnant to &s;uch and &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e re&s;earches the attention of Dr. Cranmer was &s;uddenly recalled to other objects. He received a me&s;&s;age, informing him, that the king intended to reward his &s;ervices by be|&s;towing on him the &s;ee of Canterbury, then vacant by the death of Dr. Warham.</P>
<P>Whatever exalted ideas Dr. Cranmer might entertain from the king's favour, it is very certain he was both &s;urprized, and perplexed at this me&s;&s;age. Two things e&s;pecially occurred to him as matter of great difficulty. The fir&s;t was the oath, he was obliged to take to the pope, which appeared to him as an in|&s;uperable ob&s;tacle. The other was a more private concern. He had engaged abroad in a &s;econd marriage; and however liberal
<PB N="25" REF="39">his own &s;entiments might be on that &s;ubject, he knew the prejudices of the world ran &s;trongly again&s;t him. I call them prejudices only, becau&s;e, I think, it does not appear, that the <HI>&s;ecular</HI> clergy, at that time, were ab&s;olutely required to take the vow of celibacy.</P>
<P>Whether he urged his &s;cruples to the king (who in a matrimonial bu&s;ine&s;s could not &s;urely be a rigid ca&s;ui&s;t) does not appear. It is certain however that the affair of the marriage was made ea&s;y to him; and that the king's me&s;&s;age brought him immediately to England. Hi&s;tory does not fix the time of his return with any preci&s;ion. Lord Herbert &s;ays, he was pre&s;ent at the king's marriage with Ann Bolleyn; which the late&s;t accounts celebrate on the 25th of January, 1533. Archbi&s;hop Parker &s;ays, he actually per|formed the ceremony. Fox &s;ays, it was impo&s;&s;ible, for he was certainly then in Germany. The controver&s;y is &s;carce worth deciding.</P>
<P>In however contemptible a light the pope's authority was, at this time, con|&s;idered, the new archbi&s;hop, it &s;eems,
<PB N="26" REF="40">could not legally be con&s;ecrated without bulls from Rome. Henry, it may be imagined, might have di&s;pen&s;ed with this form; but to get rid of forms is often the la&s;t work of reformation. The price of the commodity however was greatly fallen. The popes formerly ex|acted more than a thou&s;and pounds of our money, for their bulls of con&s;ecration; but the new archbi&s;hop, or rather the king, who &s;eems to have managed the matter, contrived to procure them for le&s;s than half that &s;um.</P>
<P>With regard to the oath of fidelity to the pope, which the archbi&s;hop was obliged to take at his con&s;ecration, he prote&s;ted, that he took it in no &s;en&s;e, but &s;uch as was wholly con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of God&mdash;the king's prerogative&mdash;and the &s;tatutes of the realm&mdash;that he did not bind him&s;elf from &s;peaking his mind freely in matters of religion&mdash;the government of the church; and the rights of the crown&mdash;and that he meant, on all occa&s;ions, to oppo&s;e the pope's illegal authority; and condemn his errors.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="41">This oath, taken in a &s;en&s;e &s;o very oppo&s;ite to its real intention, has often been alledged again&s;t the archbi&s;hop; and indeed it &s;eems rather to injure the feel|ings of a delicate mind. His friends however &s;uppo&s;e they &s;ufficiently apolo|gize for his behaviour, by ob&s;erving, that he made his exceptions in an open man|ner, without any mental re&s;ervation; and that he fully &s;atisfied tho&s;e, who were impowered to admini&s;ter the oath.</P>
<P>Thus was a private churchman rai&s;ed, at one &s;tep, to the fir&s;t dignity of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion; and tho the truth of hi&s;tory hath obliged us to confe&s;s, that he took &s;ome &s;teps, not quite &s;o direct, as might be wi&s;hed, in this ha&s;ty advancement; yet we cannot, by any means, con&s;ider him as a man, who had formed any &s;ettled plans of ambition, which he was re&s;olved at all hazards to &s;upport; but that, in what he did ami&s;s, he was rather vio|lently borne down by the king's autho|rity. His mildne&s;s and &s;implicity were unequally matched with the impetuo&s;ity of Henry; who having no &s;cruples of his own, con&s;idered little the &s;cruples of
<PB N="28" REF="42">others. To this may be added, that the primate thought him&s;elf &s;trongly attached by gratitude to his prince. And indeed the errors of this excellent per&s;on, as we &s;hall have other occa&s;ions to ob&s;erve, were le&s;s owing to the temptations of vice, than to the weakne&s;s of &s;ome unguarded vir|tue.&mdash;Thus much at lea&s;t may be &s;aid in apology for tho&s;e parts of his conduct, at this time, which &s;eem rather to require one.</P>
<P>As to the king, his placing &s;o good a man at the head of the church, de&s;erves little prai&s;e. If we may judge from the general tenor of his character, which was throughout unprincipled, and incon&s;i&s;tent, he meant nothing more than to advance a man, who had &s;hewn him&s;elf &s;o ready a ca&s;ui&s;t; and was able to take &s;o vigorous a part again&s;t the church of Rome, which Henry was at this time determined to op|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after his con&s;ecration, the primate was called on to fini&s;h the great cau&s;e of the divorce by pa&s;&s;ing a final &s;en|tence.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="43">The queen had retired to Ampthill, a royal man&s;ion near St. Albans; where &s;he lived with great di&s;cretion; and drew the pity and re&s;pect of the whole nation by the decency, and dignity of her &s;ufferings. The town of Dun&s;table, which lay almo&s;t in &s;ight of her windows, was appointed by Henry, with his u&s;ual indelicacy, as the place, where the archbi&s;hop and his a&s;&s;ociates, were to &s;it in con&s;i&s;tory. As Henry well knew the queen would not an&s;wer the &s;ummons; the vicinity of the place, being of no con&s;equence, had the appearance of an additional affront.</P>
<P>The queen treated the &s;ummons &s;he re|ceived, with that indignation which was expected; and being pronounced contu|macious, a final &s;entence of divorce was pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething al&s;o very indeli|cate in placing the primate at the head of this court, as he had already taken &s;o prin|cipal a part in the cau&s;e. It gave great offence to the queen, and &s;hocked the archbi&s;hop him&s;elf: but Henry, who had no idea of decency, would hear no rea&s;on again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="44">Within a few weeks after the divorce, on the 7th of September 1533, the prin|ce&s;s Elizabeth was born; and the king ordered the archbi&s;hop to be her godfa|ther.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<P>The definitive &s;entence which had pa&s;&s;ed in England, it may ea&s;ily be &s;up|po&s;ed, occa&s;ioned much clamour at Rome, where menaces of excommunication, in a very lofty tone, were thrown out. In re|turn, the king and the primate joined in an appeal to a general council; a theme, then very popular; both among prote&s;|tants, and papi&s;ts. This appeal they notified to the pope, who was then at Mar&s;eilles. It was intru&s;ted to the care of Bonner, afterwards the celebrated bi&s;hop of London; who executed his commi&s;&s;ion with his u&s;ual vehemence. The incen&s;ed
<PB N="31" REF="45">pope, on the other hand, equally impetu|ous, talked of throwing the mini&s;ter head-long into a cauldron of molten lead: on which Bonner, alarmed at the idea, pre|cipitately retired.</P>
<P>Francis I was, at this time, joined in bonds of &s;tricte&s;t amity with England. The part which Henry had taken in the affairs of Europe, after the fatal battle of Pavia, had rivetted the generous heart of the French monarch to him with more than political friend&s;hip. Francis had &s;een, with real concern, the progre&s;s of the breach between Henry and the See of Rome; and had re&s;olved to take this op|portunity of an interview with the pope, to endeavour to repay his obligations to the king of England, by bringing his di&s;agreeable difference with the pontiff, if po&s;&s;ible, to an accommodation. He made the attempt: but found the pope full of re&s;entment; and it was with the ut|mo&s;t difficulty, that he at length pre|vailed on him to promi&s;e, that Henry might &s;till expect a favourable &s;entence from the conclave, if he would make his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion before a &s;hort day, which was
<PB N="32" REF="46">appointed. But this was only half the ob&s;tacle. Henry was as lofty as the pope; and could as ill brook &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, as the other could bear controul.</P>
<P>There happened to be in the French king's retinue at Mar&s;eilles, a churchman of very eminent abilities, Bellay bi&s;hop of Bayonne. An accidental circum&s;tance had ju&s;t thrown the eyes of all men upon him. The night before the pope made his public entrance, it was di&s;covered, that the pre&s;ident of the parliament, who had been appointed to receive him with a Latin oration, had unluckily cho&s;en a &s;ubject, which would certainly give the pontiff offence: and yet there was no time for a new compo&s;ition. In this ar|ticle of extremity, when the whole bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the ceremonial was deranged, Bellay offered his &s;ervice to &s;peak extem|pore; and did it with &s;uch uncommon propriety and elegance, that he was marked, from that time, as a man of the fir&s;t genius in France.</P>
<P>This per&s;on the French king made choice of to per&s;uade Henry into the agreement, he had ju&s;t made with the
<PB N="33" REF="47">pope. The bi&s;hop knew mankind, and could adapt him&s;elf to their foibles. Henry was well tinctured with the eru|dition of tho&s;e times; and affected greatly the character of being a patron of learning. Bellay knew him thoroughly; and draw|ing the di&s;cour&s;e from bu&s;ine&s;s to letters, would often put him in mind of the great reputation he had in Europe for learning; and how much the whole catholic cau&s;e was indebted to his pen. By artfully in&s;inuating the&s;e topics, he at length en|gaged Henry to accept the accommoda|tion, which Francis had made for him; and to &s;end a courier with his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Rome.</P>
<P>This treaty with the pope was not tran&s;acted &s;o &s;ecretly, but in part it tran|&s;pired, and gave the fir&s;t alarm to the prote&s;tant party; whom it intirely con|vinced of the ficklene&s;s of the king's temper, and of the &s;lender grounds they had for the certainty even of a bare tole|ration. None was more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed than the archbi&s;hop: but with his u&s;ual calm|ne&s;s, and caution he held his peace; and tru&s;ted for the protection of religion to
<PB N="34" REF="48">that Almighty Hand, which had begun the reformation of it.</P>
<P>In this &s;u&s;pence the minds of men re|mained many weeks; and they who&s;e principles waited on every change, began already to waver; and to talk publicly of the precipitancy of the late innovations, which ran the ri&s;k of throwing the king|dom into &s;uch a &s;erment, as could not ea&s;ily be allayed.</P>
<P>At length the long expected courier ar|rived from Rome; and produced a new agitation in the minds of men. All was now declared to be over; and &s;uch a breach made with the pope, as could never again be healed.</P>
<P>The account of the matter was this. Contrary winds had detained the courier, it &s;eems, beyond his day. The bi&s;hop of Bayonne, (who, after all his &s;ervices in England, had him&s;elf undertaken a voyage to Rome to negotiate with the pope) pre&s;&s;ed his holine&s;s to make &s;ome allow|ance for the uncertainty and danger of winds, and &s;eas; e&s;pecially as it was then
<PB N="35" REF="49">in the depth of winter: and to &s;u&s;pend a definitive &s;entence for one week only. But the emperor's influence, and the pope's own ira&s;cible temper prevailed for ha&s;tier mea&s;ures. Nay even the u&s;ual forms of bu&s;ine&s;s were accelerated; and after a &s;horter hearing than, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, was commonly allowed, a definitive &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed, confirming the king's marriage with Catharine; and declaring him excommunicated, if he did not put away his pre&s;ent queen.</P>
<P>Two days after the definitive &s;entence had pa&s;&s;ed, the king's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion arrived. The pope &s;tood agha&s;t: but it was now too late: the &s;entence could not be re|viewed; the cardinals of the oppo&s;ition holding firm to the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of the conclave.&mdash;If any event could au|thorize man to point out the immediate finger of God, this certainly might.</P>
<P>Many hi&s;torians have entertained doubts of the king's &s;incerity in this bu&s;ine&s;s: and it is certain the parliament, at this time, was beginning to take mea&s;ures not very agreeable to the popi&s;h intere&s;t. But however this may be reconciled, it
<PB N="36" REF="50">is difficult to &s;ay, what Henry's meaning could be, if it was not pure. He had already felt his own &s;trength; and was under no nece&s;&s;ity either to amu&s;e, or temporize: nor was duplicity, among tho&s;e faults, which are commonly laid to his charge.</P>
<P>While affairs with the court of Rome were thus depending, the emi&s;&s;aries of the popi&s;h party allowed them&s;elves unbridled licence in England. We are amazed that &s;uch a prince as Henry could bear to be told in his own chapel, <HI>That unle&s;s he re&s;tored religion, dogs &s;hould lick his blood, as they had licked the blood of Ahab.</HI> But there was a gro&s;&s;ne&s;s in the manners of tho&s;e times, which we mu&s;t carry along with us in all our inquiries into them. The actions of men were perhaps more re&s;trained, than they are now: their tongues were certainly more licentious; and Henry, who had no idea of delicacy him|&s;elf, was le&s;s offended, than might be imagined, at the gro&s;s indelicacy of others.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="51">But of all the efforts of the popi&s;h clergy, at this time, the delu&s;ions of the maid of Kent were the mo&s;t extraordinary. This enthu&s;ia&s;t, falling into artful hands, was managed in &s;uch a way, as to draw the attention of the whole kingdom. Her prophecies were uttered in very free languages and &s;he poured the vengeance of heaven, with a very liberal hand, on the king, and his abettors. Her impo&s;|tures were at length detected; and &s;he &s;uffered death, with her accomplices.</P>

<P>The parliament, in the mean time, took vigorous mea&s;ures in &s;upport of religious liberty. Such a &s;pirit was rai&s;ed in the commons, that they debated freely on the great que&s;tion of the &s;upre|macy of the pope&mdash;a que&s;tion, which, if ever moved before, had been always treated with the utmo&s;t di&s;tance, and ti|midity. It was carried however now
<PB N="38" REF="52">again&s;t the &s;ee of Rome with a very high hand.</P>
<P>In elder times, when parliaments que&s;tioned only &s;ome exorbitant claim of the pope&mdash;his power to rai&s;e money in England, or to confer benefices on fo|reigners; however &s;pirited &s;uch inquiries appeared at the time, po&s;terity &s;aw they had been carried on without fore&s;ight. A few branches might be lopped off: but as the trunk it&s;elf was left &s;tanding, it was able, at the returning &s;ea&s;on, to &s;hoot as vigorou&s;ly as before.</P>
<P>One would have imagined, that an act &s;o de&s;tructive of popery, as the act of &s;upremacy, would, at lea&s;t, have been retarded by &s;ome di&s;&s;enting voices, among &s;o many, who were friends to the &s;ee of Rome in their hearts. But tho it met with oppo&s;ition, yet it was much le&s;s oppo&s;ed than could have been imagined; and by few per&s;ons of con&s;equence. Lee of York, Tun&s;tal of Durham, and Stoke&s;ly of London, all papi&s;ts, and two of them bigoted, acceded to it. Gar|diner was even &s;trenuous in its &s;upport. "The <HI>realm</HI> and the <HI>church,</HI> (&s;aid he,
<PB N="39" REF="53">with that &s;ubtilty, which was character|i&s;tic in him) con&s;i&s;t of the &s;ame people. And as the king is head of the <HI>realm:</HI> he mu&s;t therefore be head of the <HI>church."</HI></P>
<P>This act was obtained chiefly by the abilities of the primate, who di&s;covered &s;uch a fund of learning, and good &s;en&s;e on the que&s;tion; and delivered his &s;enti|ments in &s;uch a flow of natural and ea&s;y eloquence, that he &s;ilenced oppo&s;ition, and gave his cau&s;e all the lu&s;tre, which rea&s;on and argument could give.</P>
<P>When the prejudices of men began to cool; and the con&s;equences of this very important act were &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, all &s;ober men of every denomination acknowledged the utility of it. They hoped a more orderly clergy would now &s;ucceed; who&s;e manners might be more ea&s;ily in&s;pected; and who&s;e conduct would be amenable to civil authority. They hoped an end would now be put to tho&s;e conte&s;ts between the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;|tical powers, which had often co&s;t the nation &s;o dear. They &s;aw a way opened for the redre&s;s of many grievances, which could not ea&s;ily approach the court of
<PB N="40" REF="54">Rome at &s;o remote a di&s;tance, and &s;o in|trenched in forms. In &s;hort, they fore|&s;aw a variety of advantages from the &s;im|plicity of the government, as it was now e&s;tabli&s;hed; and from the abolition of that gro&s;s ab&s;urdity in every political &s;y&s;tem, an <HI>imperium in imperio.</HI></P>
<P>The prote&s;tants had &s;till farther cau&s;e for rejoicing. They con&s;idered this act, as the only thing, which could open a way to reformation. For tho in it&s;elf it had no immediate connection either with doctrine, or di&s;cipline; yet without it, no &s;tep could be taken towards the refor|mation of either. Be&s;ides, they thought the abrogation of the decretals was a great &s;tep towards the introduction of the bible; and imagined, they &s;hould be able, through &s;o wide a breach, to pu&s;h out every error, and every corruption of the church.</P>
<P>When this celebrated act pa&s;&s;ed; ano|ther, as a kind of appendage to it, pa&s;&s;ed al&s;o&mdash;the act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; which &s;ettled the crown on the children of the pre&s;ent
<PB N="41" REF="55">queen; declaring Mary, the daughter of Catharine, in effect illegitimate.</P>
<P>This act involved in ruin two excellent men, Fi&s;her bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, and Sir Thomas More. The parliament had de|clared the denial of the king's &s;upremacy to be high trea&s;on: and impo&s;ed a te&s;t|oath to be taken by all people in office; and indeed univer&s;ally, if required. Fi&s;her refu&s;ed it; and More, when que&s;tioned, talked in very ambiguous language. He might as well have &s;poken plainly. Henry, impatient of controul, con&s;idered his ambiguity as guilt. The primate laboured with every application of his intere&s;t, and talents, to pre&s;erve the&s;e victims of lawle&s;s power. With More he had lived on terms of great fa-miliarity; and was prompted to employ even ca&s;ui&s;try to &s;ave him. "On one hand, &s;aid he, you are <HI>doubtful</HI> as to the point in que&s;tion. On the other, you are <HI>certain,</HI> you ought to obey your prince. Let <HI>doubt</HI> then give way to <HI>certainty.</HI>"&mdash;More &s;miled, and laid his head upon the block.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="56">This was not the only innocent blood, which was &s;hed at this time. That queen, for who&s;e &s;ake Henry had put away a wife, with whom he had lived twenty years, was her&s;elf in little more than three, become the object of his aver&s;ion; and was condemned to death on the mere&s;t &s;urmi&s;e. A few unguarded expre&s;&s;ions were the utmo&s;t, that could be proved again&s;t her. She was a lady of a gay and lively temper; and in &s;uch di&s;|po&s;itions, little, verbal levities are not only con&s;i&s;tent with the pure&s;t manners; but even &s;ometimes perhaps indicative of them. Henry however wi&s;hed not to find her innocent; and indi&s;cretion had the force of crime.</P>
<P>Among the many &s;u&s;picious circum|&s;tances, which attended this very my&s;te|rious affair, it was not one of the lea&s;t, that during the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it, the arch|bi&s;hop was directed, by an order from the king, to keep his hou&s;e at Lambeth. The popi&s;h party were univer&s;ally bent again&s;t the queen; and, it was &s;uppo&s;ed,
<PB N="43" REF="57">were afraid of the primate's interpo&s;ition, and influence.</P>
<P>Henry however, when it &s;erved his purpo&s;e, introduced him as an actor in the affair. The life of the queen was not all the king aimed at. Her daughter, the lady Elizabeth, mu&s;t al&s;o be declared illegitimate, to make way for the po&s;terity of his future con&s;ort. To this end, he re&s;olved, on the &s;trength of &s;ome &s;urmi&s;e of a precontract, to be divorced from her, before he put her to death. But tho the earl of Northumberland, who was &s;up|po&s;ed to be the other party, made the mo&s;t &s;olemn allegations, that no &s;uch contract had ever exi&s;ted, yet the king was determined &s;he &s;hould be found guilty; and the archbi&s;hop was to be his in&s;trument. To him, it is &s;aid, the queen made a private confe&s;&s;ion of her crimes; and the comment of hi&s;tory on her confe&s;&s;ion is, that having been &s;en|tenced to be burnt, or beheaded, as the king plea&s;ed, &s;he was terrified into a con|&s;e&s;&s;ion to avoid the more rigorous part of the &s;entence. On the &s;trength however
<PB N="44" REF="58">of this confe&s;&s;ion, the archbi&s;hop pa&s;&s;ed a &s;entence of divorce.</P>
<P>Immediately after this &s;entence, &s;he was beheaded; and the king, void of every idea, not only of feeling, but of decency, the very next day married Jane Seymour. By this precipitancy however he made a better apology for the unfortu|nate Ann Bolleyn, than the mo&s;t zealous of her advocates could have done.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the whole of this black affair&mdash;the want of legal evidence to prove any crime&mdash;yet a &s;entence of death pa&s;&s;ed in con&s;equence of that in|&s;ufficient proof&mdash;a precontract &s;uppo&s;ed, which was to void the marriage&mdash;and yet the crime of adultery &s;till charged&mdash;the terrifying mode of the &s;entence&mdash;and above all the king's known attachment to another lady&mdash;we are &s;urprized to find a man of the archbi&s;hop's character &s;ub|mitting, in any &s;hape, to be an actor in &s;o complicated a &s;cene of barbari&s;m, cruelty, ab&s;urdity, and inju&s;tice. The confe&s;&s;ion had certainly all the appearance of being extorted&mdash;by both parties the contract was denied on oath&mdash;and if both
<PB N="45" REF="59">parties had even confe&s;&s;ed it, it is proba|ble, that the archbi&s;hop might have found &s;trong arguments to prove, in any other in&s;tance, that a con&s;ummated mar|riage was a more inviolable bond, than a precontract; and &s;till more &s;o, if the parties fir&s;t contracting had given up their mutual vows. The whole, in &s;hort, has the appearance of a di&s;hone&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a tyrant's pa&s;&s;ions; and we can apolo|gize for it only as we have done for &s;ome other of this prelate's compliances, by &s;uppo&s;ing that his meekne&s;s was violently borne down by the king's impetuo&s;ity.</P>
<P>Indeed the plenitude of a king's power was never &s;o thoroughly impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of men, as in this reign; tho it took in future reigns, as far as &s;uch jargon can do, a more &s;y&s;temized form. The Vox Dei, which was afterwards too freely &s;uppo&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue from the people, was however now &s;uppo&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue &s;olely from the throne. When therefore we find the&s;e great conde&s;cen&s;ions to a prince in men of eminent characters, we mu&s;t not mea&s;ure them by the liberal notions of later times; but mu&s;t make &s;ome allow|ances
<PB N="46" REF="60">for tho&s;e high ideas of kingly power, which prevailed in tho&s;e periods, in which they lived.</P>
<P>It is true, we are told, the primate made a &s;pirited application to the king in the queen's favour: but on this apology, it is probable, none of his advocates will be very forward to expatiate. The more innocent he thought her, the more guilty he mu&s;t think him&s;elf.</P>
<P>How far his acting <HI>ex officio</HI> was an apology, let tho&s;e define, who think them&s;elves obliged to perform the func|tions of an office, which requires unlaw|ful deeds.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VI.</HEAD>
<P>Queen Ann's death was con&s;idered by the popi&s;h party as the &s;ignal of vic|tory. They had little conception, that the prote&s;tants could unite under any other leader, who could have intere&s;t with the king. But they formed a wrong
<PB N="47" REF="61">judgment; and had the mortification, to &s;ee the primate's influence in no degree dimini&s;hed. All therefore, who wi&s;hed well to a reformation, looked up to him, as the only per&s;on, who was capable of conducting it. And indeed he was every way qualified to an&s;wer their wi&s;hes. By prudent caution, di&s;crete forbearance, and pure &s;implicity of manners, he was able to oppo&s;e and counter-act the de&s;igns of &s;ome of the mo&s;t artful men of his time. For there are &s;ea&s;ons, when &s;im|plicity will have the advantage of art; and will mi&s;lead even the de&s;igning man; who judging from his own feelings, con&s;iders a plain, and open behaviour as a ma&s;k.</P>
<P>It was very nece&s;&s;ary indeed that the prote&s;tant cau&s;e &s;hould have at lea&s;t one able leader: for except the archbi&s;hop him&s;elf, there was not a man who fa|voured it, and had the power to conduct it. The earl of E&s;&s;ex, it is true, who was then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, was a man of great ability. No one had taken a ju&s;ter mea&s;ure of the times; or under&s;tood with more exactne&s;s, that difficult part of the
<PB N="48" REF="62">mini&s;terial office, the management of parties. But E&s;&s;ex &s;at at another helm, which called for all his addre&s;s; and he could rarely a&s;&s;i&s;t the archbi&s;hop, however well-inclined, except when the affairs of the church coincided with the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate: nor was he enough acquainted with theological matters to give a con&s;e|quential opinion in any of the intended alterations of religion.</P>
<P>Among the bi&s;hops of tho&s;e times, who favoured the reformation, were, Latimer bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, Shaxton of Sali&s;bury, and Barlow of St. David's. The&s;e were the primate's natural coadjutors; but none of them was able to give him any material a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Latimer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every virtue that could adorn a Chri&s;tian prelate. No man oppo&s;ed vice more &s;ucce&s;sfully; or kept the clergy of his dioce&s;e in better order. But in traver&s;ing the arts of party, he had no addre&s;s. Perfectly &s;incere him|&s;elf, he had little comprehen&s;ion of the duplicity of others; and &s;eemed to think, that nothing was requi&s;ite to give either a party, or an individual, a proper direc|tion,
<PB N="49" REF="63">but a genuine di&s;play of truth. He con&s;idered only what was right to be done; not what the times could bear.</P>
<P>Shaxton had lived more in the world than Latimer; but was &s;till a wor&s;e a&s;&s;ociate to the archbi&s;hop. He had an unaccommodating &s;ourne&s;s about him; which was continually taking, or giving offence. His moro&s;ene&s;s was marked &s;trongly in the lines of his vi&s;age; which almo&s;t prejudiced men at &s;ight again&s;t every propo&s;al he could make. Nor was he without a tincture of pride, and &s;elf importance; which are bad in any man, wor&s;e in a churchman, and wor&s;t of all in a reformer.</P>
<P>Barlow was as little depended on by the archbi&s;hop as either of the other. He was a man of &s;en&s;e and learning; but was &s;o indi&s;crete, &s;o totally unguarded, and his conver&s;ation &s;o full of levity, that the primate was always afraid of any com|munication with him on matters of bu&s;i|ne&s;s: and would &s;ometimes &s;ay, on coming to the conclu&s;ion of a long debate; "This is all very true; but my brother
<PB N="50" REF="64">Barlow, in half an hour, will teach the world to believe it is but a je&s;t."</P>
<P>Perhaps indeed it was not to be re|gretted, that the primate had no a&s;&s;o|ciate. Under the wi&s;e councils of one prudent man the arduous bu&s;ine&s;s of re|formation probably pro&s;pered better, than it could have done in the hands of many. In the whole &s;y&s;tem of human affairs, it is certainly the nice&s;t point to conduct the religious opinions of the public. The more quietly, and gently every change is introduced, the better. Altercation is fatal to the attempt; and altercation is generally found in a multi|plicity of voices. A multiplicity of opi|nions &s;ucceeds a multiplicity of voices. The pa&s;&s;ions armed with religious zeal &s;oon enter the li&s;ts; and all is pre&s;ently confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom, and deci&s;ive judgment of a &s;ingle leader prevented this. By attend|ing carefully to times, and &s;ea&s;ons, and throwing out only &s;uch innovations as he found men were able to bear, the prudent archbi&s;hop introduced imperceptibly the mo&s;t con&s;equential changes.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="65">His difficulties however were very great. To form a religious e&s;tabli&s;hment out of the general confu&s;ion, in which all things were now involved, appeared a work of infinite perplexity. That flux of opinions, which the reformation occa|&s;ioned, was an endle&s;s &s;ource of di&s;cord: and the more men receded from that cen|tral point of authority, which had drawn them together; the wider they &s;pread from each other. Every man had his fa|vourite tenet, in which he thought the &s;um of chri&s;tianity con&s;i&s;ted; little &s;ects began to form them&s;elves; and the pri|mate &s;oon found, how impo&s;&s;ible it was to impre&s;s the large idea of religion upon the narrow mind of party.</P>
<P>The &s;ame diver&s;ity of opinion which di&s;tracted the people, was found among the leaders. Every one had his own creed; and the mi&s;chief was, that no man thought it a hard&s;hip to impo&s;e his own creed on others. Some thought the ceremonies only of the Romi&s;h church were antichri&s;tian; and adhered with firmne&s;s to its doctrines. Others rejected the doctrines; but were dazzled with the
<PB N="52" REF="66">&s;plendor of its ceremonies. Some again thought it prudent, as a conciliating mea|&s;ure, to retain every thing that could be retained with innocence: while others cried out loudly for utter extirpation; and thought the farther they got from popery, the nearer they advanced to truth.</P>
<P>The difficulties, in the way of refor|mation, which aro&s;e thus from the dif|ferent opinions of prote&s;tants, were &s;till greatly increa&s;ed by the oppo&s;ition of papi&s;ts. This large body of men, it may ea&s;ily be imagined, were more than ordi|narily inflamed by the turn, which affairs were likely to take again&s;t them. If they were before formidable for their numbers, they now became more &s;o, when em|bodied in a &s;uffering cau&s;e, &s;upporting one common end, and availing them&s;elves of all tho&s;e arts, which are generally made u&s;e of by the in&s;truments of de|clining party. Among the&s;e arts, the mo&s;t obvious, and the mo&s;t effectual, was, to &s;oment jealou&s;y, and di&s;cord among the various &s;ectaries of the new
<PB N="53" REF="67">religion; to which of them&s;elves they were &s;ufficiently inclined.</P>
<P>But the difficulties, which aro&s;e from the popi&s;h party, would have been more ea&s;ily &s;urmounted, if the king had not been at its head. The fame, which Henry had acquired, as <HI>defender of the faith,</HI> had invariably attached his haughty mind to the doctrines of popery. The &s;upremacy indeed &s;lattered his ambition; and he was glad, as far as that was an object, to coincide with the circum|&s;tances of the times: but he was careful to have it believed, that he was no con|vert to the opinions of the new faith; and that his heart had not received the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion again&s;t the religion of his fore|fathers. Whatever advantage therefore the prote&s;tants gained during this reign, they were intirely indebted for it, either to the pride, the caprice, or the intere&s;t of the king.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the&s;e difficulties, the arch|bi&s;hop endeavoured gradually to mature in his own brea&s;t every part of the great
<PB N="54" REF="68">&s;cheme he had in view, before he ven|tured to bring it forward.</P>
<P>He began, in the &s;pirit of equity, with redre&s;&s;ing the abu&s;es of his own courts; tho together with the&s;e abu&s;es, he retrenched his own &s;ees and tho&s;e of his officers. This gave the public an early and favourable impre&s;&s;ion of his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The great number of idle holidays, with which the calendar was charged, became the next object of his cen&s;ure. The archbi&s;hop him&s;elf, to the a&s;toni&s;h|ment of tho&s;e around him, &s;at down to a hot &s;upper on the eve of St. Thomas of Canterbury. As the&s;e holidays interfered with feed time and harve&s;t, it was gene|rally not unpopular to aboli&s;h them.</P>
<P>It was popular al&s;o, as well as highly nece&s;&s;ary, to regulate the public di&s;|cour&s;es of the clergy. The pulpit elo|quence indeed of that time was little more than a gro&s;s attempt to exalt the power of the church. The good arch|bi&s;hop &s;aw its abu&s;e; and endeavoured to make it the vehicle of in&s;truction. But the regulations he yet made were few.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="69">With his u&s;ual caution he felt his ground, as he proceeded; and it was not till long afterwards, that he compleated his inten|tion on this head, by the publication of the homilies.</P>
<P>How exceedingly a reformation in preaching was wanted, we may judge from the following extracts from &s;ermons, which we may &s;uppo&s;e were the be&s;t the times produced, as they were thought worthy of being made public.&mdash;In one of the&s;e &s;ermons, the prie&s;t inveighing again&s;t irreverence to the mini&s;ters of re|ligion, tells the following &s;tory: "St. Au&s;tin," &s;ays he, "&s;aw two women prating together in the pope's chapel, and the fiend &s;itting in their necks, writing a long roll of what the women &s;aid. Pre&s;ently letting it fall, St. Au&s;tin took it up; and a&s;king the women, what they had &s;aid, they an&s;wered, Only a few pater-no&s;ters. Then St. Au&s;tin read the bill, and there was never a good word in it."&mdash;In another &s;ermon we are told, "that, four men had &s;tolen an abbot's ox. The abbot did a &s;entence, and cur&s;ed them. Three of them were &s;hriven, and a&s;ked
<PB N="56" REF="70">mercy. The fourth died, without being ab&s;olved. So when he was dead, his &s;pirit walked by night, and &s;cared all who &s;tirred from their hou&s;es after &s;un &s;et. It happened that once, as a prie&s;t went in the night, with God's body, to a &s;ick man, the &s;pirit met him, and told him who he was, and why he walked; and prayed the prie&s;t to tell his wife to make amends to the abbot, that he might ab&s;olve him; for he could have no re&s;t till then. So this was done, and the poor &s;oul at length went to re&s;t."&mdash;In a &s;ermon upon the ma&s;s, the people are told, that, among the benefits ari&s;ing from it, "On the day they hear it, all idle oaths, and forgotten &s;ins &s;hall be forgiven. On that day they &s;hall not lo&s;e their &s;ight; nor die a &s;udden death; nor wax aged: and every &s;tep thitherward, and homeward, an angel &s;hall reckon."&mdash;The immediate tendency of &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es was obvious.</P>

<P>Thus far the primate, however cautious, ventured with le&s;s he&s;itation. What he had yet done was little more, than fell under his own proper authority. But it required more addre&s;s to &s;trip the popular opinions of the times of that error, and ab&s;urdity, which adhered to them. Some &s;teps however were taken, which at lea&s;t narrowed a few of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of the popi&s;h doctrines.</P>
<P>Tradition was not expre&s;&s;lly di&s;avowed; but the bible, and creeds were made the rule of faith.&mdash;Images were not for|bidden; but the people were in&s;tructed to con&s;ider them only as incentives of devo|tion.&mdash;Prayers to &s;aints were allowed; but Chri&s;t's &s;ole mediation with the Father was in&s;i&s;ted on.&mdash;Sprinkling holy water, &s;cattering a&s;hes, and creeping to the cro&s;s, were tolerated; but the people were a&s;&s;ured, they made no atonement for
<PB N="58" REF="72">&s;in.&mdash;The exi&s;tence of purgatory was not di&s;puted; but all indulgences, and mercenary pardons were declared invalid.</P>
<P>How far indeed the archbi&s;hop him&s;elf was inlightened, cannot ea&s;ily be known at this day: but it is probable, that whatever had been his own private opi|nions, he would not have ventured far|ther in public, than he now did.</P>
<P>The doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation was left preci&s;ely as it &s;tood. Our eccle&s;i|a&s;tical writers all agree, that the primate him&s;elf held that opinion, till within a few years of his death; which is the more &s;urprizing, as Wicliff, near two centuries before, had &s;aid much to bring it into di&s;credit. How firmly attached the primate was to it, at this time, ap|peared on the following occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>John Lambert, a man of eminent piety, having denied the real pre&s;ence, was cited before the archbi&s;hop; who with a mix|ture of mildne&s;s and gravity, expo&s;tulated with him, on his maintaining &s;o un&s;crip|tural an error. Lambert retired mode&s;tly; but it appearing afterwards, that he was not converted, the affair was carried before
<PB N="59" REF="73">the king. The king, re&s;olving him&s;elf to confute &s;o notorious a heretic, cited him to enter into free debate on the &s;ubject. The royal pedant entered the place of com|bat, &s;urrounded by his bi&s;hops, and nobles. The archbi&s;hop &s;at at his right hand, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted at this very extraordinary di&s;puta|tion. Lambert being confounded with an a&s;&s;embly &s;o little &s;uited to the freedom of debate, yielded an ea&s;y victory to the king; who triumphing over him in the true &s;pi|rit of a polemic; condemned him to the &s;take. We do not find that the archbi&s;hop took any part in his death; it were to be wi&s;hed he had rid his hands of the di&s;pu|tation likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>The primate &s;hewed the &s;ame attachment to the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation on another occa&s;ion. Vadian, a learned fo|reigner, having written a treati&s;e again&s;t the corporeal pre&s;ence, thought it a proper work for the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury to patronize, and pre&s;ented it to him; con|cluding that his grace's opinions on that &s;ubject, were as liberal as his own. But the archbi&s;hop was not a little di&s;plea&s;ed. He informed Vadian, that his book had
<PB N="60" REF="74">not made a convert of him; and that he was hurt with the idea of being thought the patron of &s;uch un&s;criptural opinions.</P>
<P>In the year 1538, the archbi&s;hop fini&s;hed a great work, which he had long had in hand, the printing of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> bible.</P>
<P>Wicliff was the fir&s;t Engli&s;hman, who undertook to render the holy &s;criptures into his native tongue. But Wicliff's tran&s;la|tion was now ob&s;olete; and to be found only as a matter of curio&s;ity in a few libra|ries. In the year 1526 Tindal tran&s;lated and printed the new te&s;tament in the low countries. But his tran&s;lation, which was rather a ha&s;ty performance, was very incorrect; and nobody was more &s;en&s;ible of its deficiences than Tindal him&s;elf. He was public &s;pirited enough to have amended the faults of it, by a new edition: but his finances were too &s;canty for &s;uch an undertaking. The zeal of Tun&s;tal bi|&s;hop of Durham, furni&s;hed him the means. Tun&s;tal, tho a papi&s;t, was the mo&s;t mo|derate of men; and being de&s;irous of re|moving a &s;tumbling block as quietly as
<PB N="61" REF="75">po&s;&s;ible, he privately bought up the whole impre&s;&s;ion at his own expence, and burnt it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A copy of this impre&s;&s;ion, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the only copy remaining, was picked up by one of the late lord Oxford's collectors; and was e&s;teemed &s;o valuable a pur|cha&s;e by his lord&s;hip, that it is &s;aid he &s;ettled 20&pound;. a year for life on the per&s;on who procured it. Lord Oxford's library being afterwards purcha&s;ed by O&s;born, at Grey's Inn gate, this curious book was marked by the undi&s;cern|ing book&s;eller at fifteen &s;hillings only; at which price Mr. Ames bought it. When Mr. Ames's books were offered to the public by Mr. Langford, in May 1760, this book was &s;old by auction for fourteen guineas and a half. In who&s;e hands it is now, I have not heard.</NOTE>. This money being returned into Tindal's hands, enabled him to republi&s;h his work in a more correct form. By the great indu&s;try however of the popi&s;h party this edition al&s;o was in a good mea&s;ure &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: and indeed it was at be&s;t an inaccurate tran&s;lation; being the per|formance only of a &s;ingle man, who la|boured al&s;o under many di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>This ver&s;ion however, inaccurate as it was, the archbi&s;hop made the ba&s;is of the work, he now intended; and the method he took, was to &s;end portions of it to be corrected by the bi&s;hops, and other learned divines; re&s;erving to him&s;elf the revi&s;al of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="76">Stoke&s;ley, bi&s;hop of London, was the only prelate, who refu&s;ed his contribution. "It is no wonder," (&s;aid one of the arch|bi&s;hop's chaplains, with more humour, than charity) "that my lord of London refu&s;es to have any hand in this bu&s;ine&s;s: it is a te&s;tament, in which he knows well he hath no legacy." This bible, through the means of the lord E&s;&s;ex, was licen&s;ed by the king; and fixed to a de&s;k in all pa|rochial churches.</P>
<P>The ardour, with which, we are infor|med, men flocked to read it, is incredible. They, who could, purcha&s;ed it; and they who could not, crouded to read it, or to hear it read, in churches; where it was common to &s;ee little a&s;&s;emblies of mecha|nics meeting together for that purpo&s;e after the labour of the day. Many even learned to read in their old age, that they might have the plea&s;ure of in&s;tructing them&s;elves from the &s;criptures. Mr. Fox mentions two apprentices, who joined, each his little &s;tock, and bought a bible, which at every interval of lei&s;ure, they read; but being afraid of their ma&s;ter, who was a zealous papi&s;t, they kept it under the
<PB N="63" REF="77">&s;traw of their bed. Such was the exta&s;y of joy, with which this ble&s;&s;ing was received at that time&mdash;when it was uncommon.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards, under the authority of convocation, the archbi&s;hop took a farther &s;tep. The creed, the Lord's prayer, and the ten commandments were allowed to be taught in Engli&s;h. A plain expo&s;ition al&s;o of the more obvious points of faith, and practice, was publi&s;hed in a treati&s;e, which was generally called the <HI>bi&s;hop's book,</HI> from the hands, through which it went: its real title was, <HI>The in&s;ti|tution of a Chri&s;tian man.</HI> It was afterwards enlarged, and publi&s;hed under the royal licence; and then became the <HI>king's book.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e were the principal &s;teps, which the archbi&s;hop took in the bu&s;ine&s;s of reformation&mdash;all taken between the years 1533 and 1538. His difficult circum|&s;tances allowed no more. It is wonderful indeed he did &s;o much: for except in the matters of &s;upremacy, and tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion, the king, and he had very different &s;entiments on every topic of religion: and
<PB N="64" REF="78">the pa&s;&s;ions of Henry, tho&s;e gu&s;ts of whirlwind, made it dangerous for any one to oppo&s;e him. But the archbi&s;hop, tho he tried this hardy experiment of|tener than once, never lo&s;t his favour.&mdash;In the bu&s;ine&s;s of mona&s;teries he ri&s;ked it mo&s;t.</P>
<P>Henry had already laid his rapacious hands on &s;ome of the &s;maller hou&s;es; and finding the prey alluring, he determined to make a &s;econd, and more daring at|tempt. The larger hou&s;es afforded his avarice a more ample range. The affair was brought into parliament; and men &s;eemed to think, they were at liberty to &s;peak their opinions freely. They agreed, that the wealth of the church was a dead weight on the nation&mdash;that it debauched the clergy; and drained the people&mdash;and that it was ju&s;t, and right, to lay public hands on this u&s;ele&s;s ma&s;s of trea&s;ure.&mdash;At the &s;ame time having been &s;hocked at &s;eeing the king appropriate to him&s;elf, as he had lately done, the piety of ages; or lavi&s;h it in wanton donations on the avarice of his courtiers; they cri|ed, "Let us &s;trip the clergy of their
<PB N="65" REF="79">wealth; but let us pa&s;s a law, that it may be employed in &s;ome national &s;ervice."</P>
<P>Of the party, which held this language, the archbi@hop was at the head. With great earne&s;tne&s;s he &s;poke in this cau&s;e; and propo&s;ed various &s;chemes for throwing this ma&s;s of &s;acred trea&s;ure into &s;ome u&s;eful channel. He mentioned the en|dowment of &s;chools; the maintenance of &s;cholars at the univer&s;ities; the foundation of ho&s;pitals, and alms-hou&s;es: "Nay, rather, &s;aid he, than &s;uffer it to be con|&s;umed in private channels, let us expend it on high roads."</P>
<P>One of his &s;chemes was new; and &s;eems to have been happily conceived. He propo&s;ed to in&s;titute colleges of prie&s;ts in every cathedral, compo&s;ed of &s;tudents, ju&s;t removed, and well recommended, from the univer&s;ities. Here they were to apply them&s;elves to divinity under the eye of the bi&s;hops; who being thus ac|quainted with their worth and abilities, might collate them from the&s;e &s;eminaries to parochial charges.</P>
<P>But this, and all his other beneficial &s;chemes were overruled. The king was
<PB N="66" REF="80">determined to apply this wealth to other u&s;es; and hinted his intentions to the hou&s;e in a very intelligible manner. The royal hint gave a &s;udden change to the deliberations of parliament. Every man trembled at the idea of oppo&s;ition. Simple terror effected then, what venality hath &s;ince effected. E&s;&s;ex immediately gave way. The bolde&s;t &s;peakers were &s;ilent. The primate's was the la&s;t mouth, which opened in this cau&s;e.&mdash;His hone&s;t zeal &s;hewed the goodne&s;s of his heart; and that was the reward of his labour.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The oppo&s;ition, which the king met with in this bu&s;ine&s;s from the pro|te&s;tant party, is thought by many hi&s;to|rians to have le&s;&s;ened the archbi&s;hop's in|fluence; and to have thrown weight, at this time, into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale. It is certain, the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and other leaders of the popi&s;h party,
<PB N="67" REF="81">began now to a&s;&s;ume unu&s;ual &s;pirits, and to appear with more importance at court.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter was one of tho&s;e motley mini&s;ters, half &s;tate&s;man, and half eccle&s;ia&s;tic, which were common in tho&s;e needy times, when the revenues of the church were nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the &s;ervants of the crown. It was an in|vidious &s;upport; and often fa&s;tened the odium of an indecorum on the king's mini&s;ters; who had, as mini&s;ters always have, oppo&s;ition enough to parry in the common cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s: and it is very probable, that Gardiner, on this very ground, hath met with harder mea&s;ure in hi&s;tory, than he might otherwi&s;e have done.</P>
<P>He is repre&s;ented as having nothing of a churchman about him, but the name of a bi&s;hop. He had been bred to bu&s;ine&s;s from his earlie&s;t youth; and was tho|roughly ver&s;ed in all the wiles of men, con&s;idered either as individuals, or, em|bodied in parties. He knew all the modes of acce&s;s to every foible of the human heart; his own in the mean time,
<PB N="68" REF="82">dark, and impenetrable. He was a man, "who, as Lloyd quaintly &s;ays, was to be traced like the fox; and like the Hebrew, to be read backwards:" and tho the in|&s;idious ca&s;t of his eye indicated, that he was always lying in wait: yet his &s;trong &s;en&s;e, and per&s;ua&s;ive manner, inclined men to believe he was always &s;incere; as better rea&s;ons could hardly be given, than he had ready on every occa&s;ion. He was as little troubled with &s;cruples, as any man, who thought it not proper intirely to throw off decency. What moral vir|tues, and what natural feelings he had, were all under the influence of ambition; and were accompanied by a happy lubri|city of con&s;cience, which ran glibly over every ob&s;tacle.&mdash;Such is the portrait, which hi&s;torians have given us of this man; and tho the colouring may be more heightened in &s;ome, than in others; yet the &s;ame turn of feature is found in all.</P>
<P>This prelate being at the head of the popi&s;h party, and aided by the duke of Norfolk's influence, thought he had now an opportunity to &s;trike a blow, which might be fatal to the prote&s;tant cau&s;e.
<PB N="69" REF="83">The times favouring him, he in&s;inuated to the king, that the mea&s;ures he was now pur&s;uing had placed him in a very precarious &s;ituation with regard to foreign powers&mdash;that the German prote&s;tants would in all probability be cru&s;hed&mdash;and that if this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, it was very likely from the temper and &s;ituation of men and things, that his maje&s;ty would &s;ee a very formidable league excited again&s;t him by the popi&s;h princes&mdash;that it was prudent at lea&s;t to guard again&s;t &s;uch an event&mdash;and that it might ea&s;ily be done by enacting &s;ome laws in favour of the old religion, which might &s;hew Chri&s;tendom, that he had not &s;et his face again&s;t the church; but only again&s;t the &s;upremacy of the pope.</P>
<P>This language in a prudential light, was more than plau&s;ible; and it had its full effect on Henry; e&s;pecially as it co|incided with his own apprehen&s;ions. For the enterprizing &s;pirit of Charles V, then in league with the pope, &s;eemed to be carrying every thing with a full tide of &s;ucce&s;s in Germany; and to have nothing &s;o much in contemplation as to re-e&s;ta|bli&s;h,
<PB N="70" REF="84">through Europe, the &s;piritual do|minion of the pope.</P>
<P>An alteration in the public faith, was then a matter of ea&s;y deci&s;ion. The king's inclination alone was &s;ufficient to inforce it. The duke of Norfolk there|fore, as had been agreed, informed the hou&s;e of the king's wi&s;h to &s;hew his re|gard to the old religion; and as it would be agreeable to his maje&s;ty to have every body think as he did, the duke pre&s;umed, that nobody wi&s;hed to think otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The king's ideas were received with re|verence, and the whole hou&s;e became immediately zealous papi&s;ts; and pa&s;&s;ed an act, which had been framed by Gardi|ner, in favour of &s;ome of the more pe|culiar doctrines of the Roman church&mdash;tran&s;ub&s;tantiation&mdash;communion in one kind&mdash;vows of cha&s;tity,&mdash;the celibacy of the clergy&mdash;private ma&s;&s;es&mdash;and auricular confe&s;&s;ion. This act, which pa&s;&s;ed in the year 1539, is known by the name of the act of the <HI>&s;ix articles;</HI> and was guarded according to the &s;uppo&s;ed degrees of guilt, by fines, forfeitures, impri&s;onment, and death.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="85">The good archbi&s;hop never appeared in a more truly Chri&s;tian light, than on this occa&s;ion. In the mid&s;t of &s;o general a defection, (for there were numbers in the hou&s;e, who had hitherto &s;hewn great for|wardne&s;s in reformation), he alone made a &s;tand. Three days he maintained his ground; and baffled the arguments of all oppo&s;ers. But argument was not their weapon; and the archbi&s;hop &s;aw him&s;elf obliged to &s;ink under &s;uperior power. Henry ordered him to leave the hou&s;e. The primate refu&s;ed: "It was God's cau&s;e, he &s;aid, and not man's." And when he could do no more, he boldly entered his prote&s;t.&mdash;Such an in&s;tance of fortitude is &s;ufficient to wipe off many of tho&s;e courtly &s;tains, which have fa&s;tened on his memory.</P>
<P>As the primate him&s;elf was a married man, it hath been &s;aid, he was particularly intere&s;ted in this oppo&s;ition: and it is cer|tain, that as &s;oon as the act pa&s;&s;ed, he &s;ent his wife, who was a niece of O&s;iander's, into Germany. But Mr. Strype gives us good rea&s;on to believe, that his chief ob|jection to any of the&s;e articles, was the
<PB N="72" REF="86">cruelty of the penalties, with which they were guarded; &s;o alien, he thought, to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>It is amazing that the very extraordi|nary freedom, which the archbi&s;hop took on this occa&s;ion, did not entirely ruin him in the king's favour. Indeed all men expected to have &s;een him &s;ent immedi|ately to the tower. But Henry's regard for him was &s;o far from being le&s;&s;ened, that he ordered the duke of Norfolk, with the earl of E&s;&s;ex, and others, to dine with him the next day at Lambeth; and comfort him, as the king phra&s;ed it, under his di&s;appointment.&mdash;"My Lord archbi&s;hop, &s;aid E&s;&s;ex, you were born in a happy hour. You can do nothing ami&s;s. Were I to do half of what you have done, my head mu&s;t an&s;wer it:"&mdash;A prophetic &s;peech, as it afterwards appeared!</P>
<P>This &s;ingular vi&s;it, at Lambeth, tho &s;o well intended by the king, was the &s;ource of great mortification to all. The con|ver&s;ation, after dinner, falling on the late mini&s;try, and Wool&s;ey's name being men|tioned, E&s;&s;ex could not forbear drawing a parallel between the archbi&s;hop and the
<PB N="73" REF="87">cardinal. The cardinal, &s;aid he, through the violence of his temper in managing a a debate, would often change his friends into enemies: whereas the mildne&s;s of the archbi&s;hop often makes his enemies, his friends. The duke of Norfolk adopted the remark; and Surely, (&s;aid he with a &s;arca&s;tic &s;neer,) nobody knew the cardinal better, than my lord E&s;&s;ex, who was once his menial. E&s;&s;ex an&s;wered with &s;ome warmth, that he was not the only per|&s;on in company, who had &s;erved the car|dinal; at lea&s;t, who had &s;hewn an in|clination to &s;erve him: for if fame &s;poke truth, the great duke of Norfolk him&s;elf had offered to be the cardinal's admiral, if ever he &s;hould attain the papacy. The duke of Norfolk firing at this, &s;tarted up, and with a vehement oath, cried out, he lyed. E&s;&s;ex preparing to re&s;ent the affront, the archbi&s;hop got up, and with the re&s;t of the company interfering, com|po&s;ed the quarrel at that time: but the duke laid it up in one of tho&s;e &s;ecret chambers of his memory, where tho&s;e affronts are regi&s;tered, which nothing but blood can expiate.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="88">The arguments, which the archbi&s;hop had u&s;ed in parliament again&s;t the act of the &s;ix articles, had been repre&s;ented to the king in &s;o &s;trong a light, that he ex|pre&s;&s;ed a great de&s;ire to &s;ee them; and the archbi&s;hop accordingly had them fairly copied out for his in&s;pection. The fate of the volume, in which they were con|tained, occa&s;ioned &s;ome perplexity.</P>
<P>Among the amu&s;ements of the Eng|li&s;h monarchs of tho&s;e times, that of bear-baiting on the river Thames was in high e&s;teem. In this diver&s;ion Henry happened to be engaged, when the arch|bi&s;hop's &s;ecretary took boat at Lambeth, charged with his ma&s;ter's book to We&s;t|min&s;ter. The waterman had orders to keep as far as po&s;&s;ible from the tumult; but whether led by curio&s;ity to &s;ee the pa&s;time, or through &s;ome unavoidable ac|cident, he found him&s;elf pre&s;ently in the mid&s;t of the croud; and by a mi&s;chance &s;till greater, the bear making directly to his boat; climbed up the &s;ide, and over|&s;et it. The &s;ecretary was &s;oon taken up; but recovering from his &s;urprize, he found
<PB N="75" REF="89">he had lo&s;t his book. He hoped it might have &s;unk to the bottom; but he di&s;|covered afterwards, that it had fallen into the hands of &s;ome ignorant per&s;ons, who had conveyed it to a popi&s;h prie&s;t. The prie&s;t, conceiving it to be a &s;atire on the &s;ix articles, determined to carry it to the council. The &s;ecretary, in the mean time, &s;u&s;pecting what might happen, ap|plied to lord E&s;&s;ex, as his ma&s;ter's friend. He had &s;carce told his &s;tory, when the prie&s;t appeared, at the door of the coun|cil-chamber, with the book under his arm. Lord E&s;&s;ex addre&s;&s;ing him in an angry tone, and telling him that the book belonged to a privy-coun&s;ellor; the prie&s;t delivered it up, with many humble ge&s;ticulations; and was glad to get off without farther que&s;tion.</P>

<P>The act of the &s;ix articles, was a &s;ignal to the whole popi&s;h party. They now plainly &s;aw their power; and had only to exert it properly. The parlia|ment, and convocation were the &s;cenes of action. Here the primate almo&s;t &s;ingle oppo&s;ed them. A few of the bi&s;hops lent him aid; but it was feeble. They were either unintere&s;ted in the cau&s;e; or men of no abilities in bu&s;ine&s;s. One or two of them, from whom he expected a&s;&s;i&s;tance, de&s;erted him. But the &s;evere&s;t lo&s;s he felt, at this time, was that of his great friend, the earl of E&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of that eminent &s;tate&s;man declined with that of the prote&s;tants; and he paid at the block, the penalty of his ma&s;ter's offences. The di&s;&s;olution of mona&s;teries had given general di&s;gu&s;t. The alms, and ho&s;pitality of the monks, indi&s;criminately admini&s;tered, had through
<PB N="77" REF="91">a cour&s;e of ages invited &s;loth; and the&s;e channels of ready &s;upply being now &s;top|ped, the nece&s;&s;itous found it irk&s;ome to exchange a life of idlene&s;s for a life of indu&s;try. A general di&s;content &s;oon finds a mouth to expre&s;s it. Clamour grew loud; and the king's government, unea&s;y. Something mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be done.</P>
<P>Among all the arts of expediency laid up in the cabinets of princes, the readie&s;t is to &s;acrifice a mini&s;ter. The death of Cromwel was repre&s;ented to the king as the be&s;t mean of compo&s;ing the people. But tho prudential rea&s;ons may nece&s;&s;itate a prince to di&s;card a mini&s;ter, yet guilt only, and that nicely examined, can au|thorize an act of blood. The hand of a tyrant however generally throws a&s;ide the balance. It is a nice machine; and re|quires pains, and temper to adju&s;t it. The &s;word is an in&s;trument more deci|&s;ive; and of ea&s;ier di&s;patch. Henry's was always &s;tained with blood&mdash;often with innocent blood&mdash;but never with blood more innocent than that of E&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P>Among the many friends of this great man, &s;everal of whom had ta&s;ted largely
<PB N="78" REF="92">of his bounty, not a &s;ingle per&s;on en|deavoured to avert his ruin, but the pri|mate. He with generous friend&s;hip wrote to the king; united him&s;elf with the falling mini&s;ter; and endeavoured, at the hazard of his own &s;afety, to in&s;pire his royal ma&s;ter with ideas of ju&s;tice. But the fate of E&s;&s;ex was decreed; and &s;o light a thing, as a whi&s;per from the &s;till voice of ju&s;tice, could not avert it.&mdash;Hi&s;tory unites in marking the duke of Norfolk, and the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;|ter, as the &s;ecret contrivers of this ba&s;e affair.</P>
<P>The primate and E&s;&s;ex had ever main|tained a uniform friend&s;hip for each other, through every period of their power. It was a friend&s;hip pure from jealou&s;y on both &s;ides. Amid&s;t all the jarrings of court faction, nothing ever di&s;turbed it. Each knew the integrity of the other's intentions; and each &s;upported the other's &s;chemes with an exertion of all his in|tere&s;t. In &s;ome things perhaps the zeal of E&s;&s;ex for his friend was apt to carry him too far; and the primate had oftener than once occa&s;ion to repre&s;s it.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="93">A prie&s;t near Scarborough, &s;itting among his companions, over his beer, at the door of a country ale-hou&s;e; and &s;ome|body happening to mention the arch|bi&s;hop; "That man, &s;aid the prie&s;t, as great as he is now, was once but an o&s;t|ler; and has no more learning, than the go&s;lings yonder on the green." E&s;&s;ex, who had his &s;pies in every quarter, was in|formed of what the prie&s;t had &s;aid. A me&s;&s;enger was immediately di&s;patched for him; and he was lodged in the Fleet.</P>
<P>Some months elap&s;ed, when the arch|bi&s;hop, who was intirely ignorant of the affair, received a petition from the poor prie&s;t, full of penitence for his impru|dence, and of &s;upplication for mercy.</P>
<P>The primate having inquired into the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ent for him. "I hear, &s;aid he, you have accu&s;ed me of many things; and among others, of my being a very ignorant man. You have now an oppor|tunity of &s;etting your neighbours right in this matter; and may examine me, if you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>The prie&s;t, in great confu&s;ion, be&s;ought his grace to pardon him: he never would offend in the &s;ame way again.</P>

<P><PB N="80" REF="96">"Well then, &s;ays the archbi&s;hop, &s;ince you will not examine me, let me examine you."</P>
<P>The prie&s;t was thunder&s;truck; making many excu&s;es; and owning he was not much learned in book-matters.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop told him, he &s;hould not then go very deep; and a&s;ked him two or three of the plaine&s;t que&s;tions in the bible; Who was David's father? and who was Solomon's?</P>
<P>The prie&s;t, confu&s;ed at his own igno|rance, &s;tood &s;peechle&s;s.</P>
<P>"You &s;ee, &s;aid the archbi&s;hop how your accu&s;ation of me, ri&s;es again&s;t your|&s;elf. You are an admirable judge of learning and learned men.&mdash;Well, my friend, I had no hand in bringing you here, and have no de&s;ire to keep you. Get home; and if you are an ignorant man, learn at lea&s;t to be an hone&s;t one."</P>
<P>Soon after, the earl of E&s;&s;ex came to the primate; and with &s;ome warmth told him, he might for the future fight his own battles&mdash;that he had intended to to have made the prie&s;t do penance at
<PB N="81" REF="97">Paul's cro&s;s; but his grace's misjudged lenity had prevented him.</P>
<P>"My good lord, &s;aid the primate, taking him by the hand, be not offended. I have examined the man my&s;elf; and be a&s;&s;ured from me, he is neither worth your notice, nor mine."</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding however the lo&s;s of his great a&s;&s;ociate, the archbi&s;hop did not de&s;pair. An attempt was made in con|vocation to revive &s;ome popi&s;h cere|monies. A &s;ort of ritual was produced, which con&s;i&s;ted of ninety articles. The archbi&s;hop unaided went through the whole; and rea&s;oned with &s;uch &s;trength of argument, as brought over many to his opinion. Whom he could not convince, he &s;ilenced.</P>
<P>The next field, in which he appeared, was the hou&s;e of lords, where he him&s;elf made the attack, by bringing in a bill to mitigate the penalties of the &s;ix articles. This was a bold attempt, and drew on him the whole force of oppo&s;ition. The bi&s;hops of Roche&s;ter and Hereford, who
<PB N="82" REF="98">had promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, gave way, as the debate grew warm; and begged the archbi&s;hop to follow their example. It was in vain, they told him, to per&s;i&s;t: He could not benefit his cau&s;e; but he might ruin him&s;elf. The archbi&s;hop, with that &s;pirit which he always exerted, where re|ligion was concerned, declared him&s;elf carele&s;s of any con&s;equence.</P>
<P>His per&s;everance had an effect, which he dur&s;t not have hoped for. The laity were intirely exempted from the penalties of the act; and the clergy were in no dan|ger, till after the third conviction. The primate obtained al&s;o that no offences &s;hould be cognizable, after they had lain dormant a year. It is not improbable, that he was indebted for this victory to the book, which he had &s;ent to the king; the rigour of who&s;e opinions it might, in &s;ome degree, have qualified.</P>
<P>In another effort al&s;o the primate ob|tained an advantage. He prevailed with the king to allow the u&s;e of a few prayers in the Engli&s;h tongue; which was the fir&s;t attempt of the kind, that had been made.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="99">On the other hand, he had the mortifi|cation to &s;ee the u&s;e of the bible taken away. Winche&s;ter brought the affair into convocation. In the debate, which en&s;ued, the tran&s;lation was chiefly ob|jected to, <Q>Let the people have their bible, &s;aid Winche&s;ter, but let it be a correct one; and let not error and here&s;y be &s;pread by authority.</Q> He propo&s;ed therefore to have the bible care|fully examined; and with this view to have it put into the hands of the bi&s;hops; where he doubted not he had influence to &s;u&s;pend it, as long as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The primate &s;aw his policy, and with all his weight oppo&s;ed him. He wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve the pre&s;ent tran&s;lation, even with all its inaccuracies; which he thought better than to run the ri&s;k of a new one. But he could not prevail. One point however he gained. In&s;tead of putting the bible into the hands of the bi&s;hops; he got it put into the hands of the two univer&s;ities, which he &s;uppo&s;ed would be le&s;s &s;ubject to popi&s;h influence.</P>
<P>He was right in his conjecture; for the univer&s;ities were very &s;peedy in their re|vi&s;ion.
<PB N="84" REF="100">But the primate had the old battle to fight again. Tho a more correct bible was produced, yet the &s;ame oppo&s;i|tion was &s;till made to its publication; and new topics of argument were introduced. The archbi&s;hop however had now en|couraged a con&s;iderable party to &s;econd him; and the affair was combated with great vigour. But the oppo&s;ition of the popi&s;h party became &s;o formidable, that the archbi&s;hop was again intirely de|&s;erted. Single however, as he had done before, he &s;till bore up again&s;t his adver|&s;aries; and per&s;evered, till by dint of per&s;everance he obtained a limited u&s;e of the bible, tho it was never publicly al|lowed during the remainder of Henry's reign.</P>

<P>While the primate was acting this great and noble part in parliament, an un|expected
<PB N="85" REF="101">event placed him in a very deli|cate and dangerous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>At an early hour, in the morning, an unknown per&s;on, of the name of La&s;|celles, de&s;ired a &s;ecret admittance to him; and with much he&s;itation opened an affair, which the archbi&s;hop would often &s;ay, gave his &s;pirits a greater agitation, than he ever felt before, or after.&mdash;The affair was no le&s;s, than the di&s;covery of the queen's incontinence.</P>
<P>The primate with his u&s;ual caution weighed the information; and the proof, on which it re&s;ted; and he had the more time for deliberation, as the king was then on a progre&s;s. If the information were ju&s;tly founded, it was both wrong, and dangerous, to conceal it&mdash;if unju&s;tly, it was equally &s;o to divulge it. The di|lemma was difficult.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s was perplexed al&s;o by a circum&s;tance of peculiar delicacy. The queen was niece to the duke of Norfolk, who was at the head of the popi&s;h party; and the good primate, who had &s;een with what &s;ini&s;ter arts that cla&s;s of men had carried on their &s;chemes, was apprehend|&s;ive,
<PB N="86" REF="102">that &s;uch a &s;tory as this, might have too much the air of retaliation, and the malignity of party; and if it &s;hould prove fal&s;e, would fix an imputation on his character, which he had ever been careful to avoid. His enemies, he knew, were always on the watch again&s;t him; and might, for ought he knew, have taken this very method of doing him an injury.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;tracted by a view of the affair in every light, he went at la&s;t to the lord chancellor, and the earl of Hertford, whom the king had left with a com|mi&s;&s;ion of regency, during his ab&s;ence; and to them he unbo&s;omed his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of terror was over, with which the privacy of &s;uch an affair naturally &s;truck every one, who was connected with the tyrant, the chancellor, and lord Hertford were both of opinion, that as the affair re&s;ted on &s;uch undoubted evidence, it was le&s;s hazardous to divulge, than to conceal it. This point being &s;ettled, the more arduous one &s;till re|mained of informing the king. The pri|mate thought it be&s;t, that all three &s;hould join in the information; and give it that
<PB N="87" REF="103">weight, which no &s;ingle per&s;on could give. The two lords, on the other hand, were of a different opinion. As the in|telligence, they &s;aid, had been given to the primate, and they had only been con|&s;ulted, the information would come mo&s;t naturally from him. Be&s;ides, they re|marked, it was more re&s;pectful to keep a matter of &s;o delicate a nature in a &s;ingle hand; and if &s;o, the primate's eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal character, and well-known judgment made him the propere&s;t me&s;&s;enger of bad news; as when he had given the wound, he could pour in balm to heal it.&mdash;In conclu&s;ion, the meekne&s;s of the arch|bi&s;hop gave way; and he took upon him|&s;elf alone the ta&s;k of carrying the unwel|come truth to the king.</P>
<P>It was indeed an unwelcome truth. The king at this time, had &s;o little con|ception of the queen's di&s;hone&s;ty, and loved her with &s;uch entire affection, that he had lately given public thanks for the happine&s;s he enjoyed with her.</P>
<P>The method which the primate took, was, to draw up the whole affair on pa|per, with all the evidence, on which it
<PB N="88" REF="104">re&s;ted, and pre&s;ent it to the king in pri|vate.</P>
<P>Henry took the information, as we may &s;uppo&s;e he would. His &s;ury broke out in vehement execrations, and threats again&s;t tho&s;e, who had been the contri|vers of &s;uch villainy. And yet even in his rage he &s;eems to have &s;pared the arch|bi&s;hop, as a man who might be impo&s;ed on; but could not intend deceit. By degrees however, as his royal &s;ury &s;ub|&s;ided, and he examined the evidence cool|ly, it made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on him; and pa&s;&s;ions of another kind began to ri&s;e. In &s;hort, the queen and her accomplices were tried, condemned, and executed. A little before her death &s;he confe&s;&s;ed her guilt to the archbi&s;hop; and the full voice of hi&s;tory bears te&s;timony to the ju&s;tice of her &s;entence.</P>
<P>About the time, in which the arch|bi&s;hop was concerned in this affair, he was engaged in another, almo&s;t equally invidious; the vi&s;itation of All-&s;ouls-col|lege in Oxford. That &s;ociety was in
<PB N="89" REF="105">much di&s;order. Their di&s;&s;entions gave great offence; and the irregularity of their manners, &s;till greater. They are taxed, in the language of tho&s;e times, with their <HI>&s;candalous compotations, comme&s;&s;ations,</HI> and <HI>ingurgitations.</HI> The archbi&s;hop, as vi&s;i|tor, was called in by one of the contend|ing parties; and he found it no ea&s;y matter to compo&s;e their heats, and re&s;tore good manners. With his u&s;ual vigour he went through the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k; and having mixed as much lenity as po&s;&s;ible, with his cen&s;ures, he reviewed their &s;ta|tutes; and made &s;uch additions, as he hoped would prevent any mi&s;behaviour for the future.</P>
<P>In the year 1542, which was the year after the&s;e trouble&s;ome affairs, happened the battle of Solway-mo&s;s; where the Scoti&s;h army received a total defeat. Many of their nobility being taken pri&s;oners, were &s;ent to London, and committed to the care of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons about the court. The earl of Ca&s;&s;ilis, was &s;ent to Lambeth. Here he found
<PB N="90" REF="106">him&s;elf in a &s;chool of philo&s;ophy, and religion; where every thing great, and noble, and liberal abounded. Ca&s;&s;ilis him&s;elf had a turn for literature; and &s;oon became enamoured with this amiable &s;ociety. The gentlene&s;s, and benevolence of the archbi&s;hop in particular attracted his e&s;teem; and brought him to think more favourably of the reformers; to who&s;e opinions he &s;oon became a tho|rough convert. Scotland had not yet re|ceived the tenets of the reformation: and the archbi&s;hop would often &s;ay, "That when it &s;hould plea&s;e God to inlighten that country, he hoped the intimacy, which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and the earl of Ca&s;&s;ilis, might not wholly be without effect." And in fact it proved &s;o: for &s;ome years afterwards, when the reformed opinions got footing in Scot|land, nobody contributed &s;o much to e&s;tabli&s;h them, as that nobleman.</P>

<P>Tho it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the queen's death would have weakened the popi&s;h cau&s;e, yet we do not find, that it produced any &s;uch effect. Many re|marked, that after the fir&s;t heat of the rupture with Rome, the king had been gradually returning towards it; and that, with regard to all the doctrines of popery, he was, at this time, more zealous, than he had ever been: and they accounted for it very plau&s;ibly by ob&s;erving, that as his pa&s;&s;ions began to cool, the religious fear took more po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him.</P>
<P>The popi&s;h party, it is certain, at this period a&s;&s;umed unu&s;ual &s;pirits; and thought they had influence enough to obtain any point.</P>
<P>One morning the primate was &s;urprized with a me&s;&s;age from the king, who lay off Lambeth in his barge, and wi&s;hed imme|diately
<PB N="92" REF="108">to &s;peak with him. As he came on board, the king called out, "I can now inform you, who is the greate&s;t heretic in Kent:" and ordering the barge to row gently up the river, he &s;eated the archbi|&s;hop by him, and produced a large book, which, he &s;aid, contained an accu&s;ation of &s;everal of the Kenti&s;h mini&s;ters again&s;t their dioce&s;an.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop, who was not very pre|&s;ent in the article of &s;urprize, gazed fir&s;t at the king, and then at the book, and could not, in &s;ome minutes, collect an an&s;wer. The king bad him not be di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed: "I con&s;ider the affair, &s;aid he, merely as a combination of your enemies; and as &s;uch I &s;hall treat it."</P>
<P>Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;oon after appoint|ed to examine the evidence again&s;t the primate; and at the head of the board the king, with his u&s;ual indelicacy, placed the primate him&s;elf. The archbi&s;hop was &s;hocked at this de&s;ignation; and could barely be prevailed on to appear once at the opening of the commi&s;&s;ion. It &s;uf|ficiently &s;hewed however, how the king &s;tood affected; and &s;aved the archbi&s;hop's
<PB N="93" REF="109">advocates the trouble of any laboured de|fence. Each of the accu&s;ers endeavoured with what art he was able, to withdraw him&s;elf from a bu&s;ine&s;s, which was likely to bring him &s;o ungrateful a return.</P>
<P>The chief contriver of this whole affair was the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who with great a&s;&s;iduity, had collected a variety of pa&s;&s;ages from &s;ermons, and other di&s;cour&s;es in which it was &s;uppo&s;ed, the archbi&s;hop had &s;hewn more regard to the <HI>new learning</HI> (as prote&s;tanti&s;m was called) and the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of it, than the laws then in force allowed.</P>
<P>Among other agents whom Winche&s;ter employed, he drew over by his in&s;inuating arts, two per&s;ons, who were very nearly connected with the archbi&s;hop him&s;elf; Dr. Thorndon, &s;uffragan of Dover, and Dr. Barber, a civilian. Each of them had been promoted by the archbi&s;hop, and held an office under him; and both had been always treated by him on the footing of intimate friends. Barber even lived in his hou&s;e; and had a pen&s;ion &s;ettled on him, that he might be ready with his ad|vice on every occa&s;ion. When the proofs
<PB N="94" REF="110">therefore of this con&s;ederacy were put into the primate's hands, we may &s;uppo&s;e his a&s;toni&s;hment on finding a letter from each of the&s;e per&s;ons, containing a variety of matter again&s;t him, which his familia|rity, and unre&s;erved freedom with them, had ea&s;ily furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards, when the&s;e two per|&s;ons happened both to be with the archbi|&s;hop, at his hou&s;e at Becke&s;burne; "Come your ways with me, &s;aid he, leading them into his &s;tudy; I mu&s;t have your advice in a certain matter." When he had carried them to a retired window in the room, "You twain, he re&s;umed, be men, in whom I have had much tru&s;t; and you mu&s;t now give me &s;ome council. I have been &s;hamefully abu&s;ed by one or twain, to whom I have &s;hewed all my &s;ecrets, And the matter is &s;o fallen out, that they have not only di&s;clo&s;ed my &s;ecrets; but al&s;o have taken upon them to accu&s;e me of here&s;y; and are become witne&s;&s;es again&s;t me. I require you therefore to advi&s;e me, how I &s;hall behave my&s;elf to them. You are both my friends; what &s;ay you to the matter?"</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="111">Whether they had any &s;u&s;picion of the archbi&s;hop's meaning, does not appear: As the que&s;tion however was put, they could not avoid pronouncing with great &s;everity again&s;t &s;uch villany. The pri|mate then drawing the letters from his bo&s;om, "Know you, &s;aid he, the&s;e papers, my ma&s;ters?&mdash;You have con|demned your&s;elves. God make you both good men. I never de&s;erved this at your hands. If &s;uch men as you, are not to be tru&s;ted, there is no fidelity to be found. I fear my left hand will accu&s;e my right." Having &s;aid this, he added, after a pau&s;e, that they might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, he would take no &s;teps to puni&s;h their ba&s;ene&s;s; but he thought it fit to di&s;charge them from his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The king however treated the arch|bi&s;hop's accu&s;ers with more &s;everity; and threw many of them into pri&s;on. This alarming Gardiner, he wrote a letter to the primate in the following abject &s;tyle.</P>
<P><Q>Gentle father, I have not borne &s;o tender a heart towards you, as a true child ought to bear; tho you never gave me occa&s;ion otherwi&s;e; but rather
<PB N="96" REF="112">by benefits provoked me to the con|trary. I a&s;k mercy of you with as contrite a heart, as ever David a&s;ked of God.&mdash;I de&s;ire you to remember the prodigal child. I am full &s;orry for my fault; heartily confe&s;&s;ing my ra&s;hne&s;s, and indeliberate doings. Forgive me this fault; and you &s;hall never herea&s;ter perceive, but that at all times I &s;hall be as obedient, as ever was child to his natural father. I am your's, and &s;hall be your's; and that truly while I live. Good father, I have given my&s;elf unto you, heart, body, and &s;ervice. And now remember that I am your true &s;ervant.</Q></P>
<P>This letter, tho it appears from Win|che&s;ter's future life, to have been a mere artifice, &s;o wrought on the gentle nature of the primate, that hearing the king was re&s;olved to lay Winche&s;ter's letters before the hou&s;e of lords, he went to him, and at length prevailed on him, not to give the bi&s;hop any further trouble; but to let the matter drop.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="113">The event of this accu&s;ation checked the ardour of the archbi&s;hop's enemies for &s;ome time; but it revived again in about two years, on the death of Charles Bran|don duke of Suffolk.</P>
<P>With this nobleman the king had pre|&s;erved, through life, a friend&s;hip, of which it was not thought his heart was &s;u&s;ceptible; and on hearing of his death, he pronounced a &s;hort eulogy on his me|mory, which was beyond the mo&s;t la|boured panegyric. The news was brought to him in council: "God re&s;t his &s;oul! (&s;aid the king, with much emotion:) he was an hone&s;t man. I have known him long; and never knew him &s;peak a bad word behind the back of any man." Then turning round the board, with a &s;arca&s;tic air, "Of which of you, my lords, added he, can I &s;ay as much?"</P>
<P>The duke's amiable manners had long engaged the e&s;teem of the archbi&s;hop; who&s;e virtues, in return, were equally admired by the duke. A very &s;incere friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them; and it
<PB N="98" REF="114">was thought the per&s;ua&s;ive arguments of the primate had drawn the duke to think favourably of the reformers, who&s;e friend and patron, he was generally e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>Tho the duke had ever been a cautious man; and interfered little in public affairs; yet con&s;idering his favour with the king, the popi&s;h party thought his death of great advantage to their cau&s;e. They conceived, that it might both weaken the prote&s;tant intere&s;t; and tend al&s;o to le&s;&s;en the king's regard for the primate.</P>
<P>Elated with the&s;e hopes, the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and his emi&s;&s;aries, be&s;et the king, now yielding to age and infirmity; and endeavoured to awaken his religious fears. <Q>In vain might wi&s;e laws &s;truggle with here&s;ies, if the patrons of tho&s;e here&s;ies were above law. Of his ma|je&s;ty alone redre&s;s could be had. He was God's vicegerent to rectify the abu&s;es of the times; and might be a&s;&s;ured, the &s;word was not put into his hands in vain: he was accountable for the tru&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>From hints they proceeded to plainer language; and at length, in direct words,
<PB N="99" REF="115">informed the king, that while the arch|bi&s;hop &s;at in council, nothing effectual could be con&s;ulted about religion. They prayed his maje&s;ty therefore to give leave for the primate to be &s;ent to the Tower; and it would then be &s;een, how ample a charge again&s;t him would appear.&mdash;The king pondered, and con&s;ented.</P>
<P>That very evening, as it grew dark, Henry &s;ent for the archbi&s;hop to White|hall. He was walking pen&s;ively in a long gallery, when the archbi&s;hop entered. <Q>My lord of Canterbury, &s;aid the king, I have given permi&s;&s;ion to have you &s;ent to the Tower. Some lords of council have dealt with me to that purpo&s;e. They have grievous things to lay to your charge, which they dare not utter, while you have free admi&s;&s;ion to the board.</Q></P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop expre&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s to have his conduct inquired into, in whatever manner the king thought fit: and offered to go, with great alacrity, to the Tower, till he had fully an&s;wered the accu&s;ations of his adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>The king interrupting him, as his manner was, with a bur&s;t of vociferation,
<PB N="100" REF="116">expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize at the primate's &s;implicity: but immediately &s;oftening his voice, told him, that it was much ea|&s;ier to keep him from the Tower; than to deliver him out of it. <Q>You will be &s;ent for, &s;aid he, in the morning, by the council; and dealt with haughtily. If the lords talk of committing you, de&s;ire you may fir&s;t hear your accu&s;ers. If they deny this, appeal to me; and take this ring; which you may &s;hew them as a token.</Q></P>
<P>At eight the next morning, the arch|bi&s;hop was accordingly called before the council; and was kept &s;ome time, &s;tand|ing at the door. Being admitted, he punctually followed the king's directions; and when the lords in&s;i&s;ted on &s;ending him to the Tower, he appealed to the king, who had taken the affair, he told them, into his own hands. As he &s;aid this, he produced the ring, which was a token very well known.</P>
<P>Every one pre&s;ent was confounded; and the lord Ru&s;&s;el &s;tarting up, cried out, with an oath, <Q>I told you, my lords, how it would be; and that the king
<PB N="101" REF="117">would never &s;uffer him to be com|mitted.</Q></P>
<P>When the affair was brought before the king, he made a &s;hort bu&s;ine&s;s of it. Striding haughtily round the room, and throwing an eye of indignation fir&s;t on one, and then on another; "I thought, &s;aid he, I had a di&s;creet council; but I &s;ee I am deceived. How have ye handled here my lord of Canterbury? What made ye of him? a &s;lave; &s;hutting him out of the council chamber among &s;erving men.&mdash;I would have you to under&s;tand, by the faith I owe to God, (laying his hand &s;olemnly on his brea&s;t) that if a prince can be beholden to a &s;ubject, I am to my lord of Canterbury; whom I ac|count as faithful a man towards his prince, as ever was prelate in this realm: and one to whom I am &s;undry ways beholden: and therefore he that loveth me, will regard him."</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this he &s;trode out; and left the lords endeavouring which &s;hould apologize to the primate in the highe&s;t &s;train of compliment. The next day the king &s;ent &s;everal of them, as was cu&s;tom|ary
<PB N="102" REF="118">with him after &s;uch di&s;&s;entions, to dine with the archbi&s;hop at Lambeth.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;ingular in this whole affair. It is difficult to &s;ay, whe|ther Henry was at fir&s;t in earne&s;t, and afterwards changed his re&s;olution; or whether he took this method to check the forwardne&s;s of the archbi&s;hop's enemies.</P>
<P>While this &s;cene was acting in the council, a part of the fame plan was pre|paring in parliament. There Sir John Go&s;wick, in a &s;tudied harangue, accu&s;ed the archbi&s;hop of being an upholder of heretical opinions; with which he had greatly infected the county of Kent. Henry being informed of this motion, called a gentleman in waiting, and &s;ent Sir John this me&s;&s;age: <Q>Tell that varlet Go&s;wick, that if he do not pre&s;ently reconcile him&s;elf to my lord of Canter|bury, I will puni&s;h him for the ex|ample of others. What knows he of my lord's preaching in Kent? Was not he, at that time, in Bedford&s;hire?</Q>&mdash;The me&s;&s;age was very intelligible; and had its full effect.</P>

<P>But it was not only in matters of religion that every advantage was taken again&s;t the archbi&s;hop; the mo&s;t trivial cavils were often made. He had enemies ready for any &s;pecies of calumny; and Sir Thomas Seymour, who had abilities to object to nothing el&s;e, was able to object to the meanne&s;s of his hou&s;e-keeping. On this head, he threw out in&s;inuations to the king. Henry heard him with ap|parent indifference; and carele&s;ly an|&s;wered; "Ay! Seymour! and does my lord of Canterbury keep as little ho&s;pita|lity, as you &s;ay? In good faith, I thought the contrary."</P>
<P>The king &s;aid no more, but took an early opportunity to &s;end Sir Thomas, on &s;ome frivolous me&s;&s;age, to Lambeth, about dinner time. When he came there, he was carried through the great hall, where a bountiful table was &s;pread, tho
<PB N="104" REF="120">only in its ordinary manner. From thence he was conducted up fairs to the archbi&s;hop, where he found a large com|pany ju&s;t &s;itting down to dinner; among whom the archbi&s;hop, in his u&s;ual hearty manner, in&s;i&s;ted, that Sir Thomas &s;hould take a place.</P>
<P>The next time the king &s;aw him, "Well, &s;aid he, Seymour, what cheer had you at Lambeth? for I &s;uppo&s;e my lord would keep you to dine."</P>
<P>The poor man, confounded at the que&s;tion; and &s;eeing plainly the king's meaning, threw him&s;elf at his feet, and begged his Maje&s;ty to pardon the &s;oul &s;lander, with which he had a&s;per&s;ed the archbi&s;hop. He then frankly mentioned all he had &s;een; and concluded with &s;ay|ing, he believed nobody in the realm, except his highne&s;s him&s;elf, kept &s;uch a table.</P>
<P>"Ah! good man! &s;aid the king; all he hath, he &s;pendeth in hou&s;e-keeping: and if he now keep &s;uch a table, as you &s;ay, it being neither term, nor parlia|ment, he is meetly vi&s;ited, at tho&s;e times, I warrant you."&mdash;" But, added the
<PB N="105" REF="121">king, a&s;&s;uming a &s;everer tone, I know the bottom of all the&s;e fal&s;ities. You want to have a finger in church matters, do you? But you may &s;et your heart at re&s;t: while I am king, there &s;hall be no &s;uch doings."</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;inuations with regard to the archbi&s;hop's great ceconomy, &s;eem in &s;ome degree to have been credited by Sir Wil|liam Cecil; who in a letter, told the pri|mate freely, what was current at court&mdash;that he, and all the bi&s;hops were im|men&s;ely rich&mdash;and that they had nothing in view, but rai&s;ing princely fortunes for their families.&mdash;The archbi&s;hop's an|&s;wer to Cecil is &s;o ingenuous; and bears &s;o &s;trong a &s;tamp of hone&s;ty, that it is well worth tran&s;cribing.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>After my hearty commendations, and thanks, as well for your gentle letter, as for the copy of the pacification; and for your good remembrance of the two matters, which I de&s;ired you not to forget; the one concerning the bi&s;hop of Cologn's letters; and the other con|cerning Mr. Mow&s;e; for whom I give you my mo&s;t hearty thanks.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="122">As for your admonition, I take it mo&s;t thankfully; as I have ever been mo&s;t glad to be admoni&s;hed by all my friends; accounting no man &s;o fooli&s;h, as he that will not bear friendly admo|nition. For my&s;elf, I fear not that &s;aying of St. Paul, which you quote again&s;t me, half &s;o much as I do &s;tark beggary. I took not &s;o much care about my living, when I was a &s;cholar at Cambridge, as at this pre&s;ent: and if a good auditor had my accounts, he would find no great &s;urplu&s;age to grow rich on.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t of the bi&s;hops, they are all beggars, except one man; and I dare well &s;ay, he is not very rich. If I knew any bi&s;hop that were covetous, I would &s;urely admoni&s;h him.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The&s;e invidious reports with regard to the avarice of the bi&s;hops, are commonly a&s;cribed to the avarice of the courtiers; who were de&s;irous of adding the revenues of the bi&s;hopricks to the &s;poils of the mona&s;teries. The wealth of the bi&s;hops therefore was the fa&s;hionable court-topic of that day: and every patriot declaimed on the expediency of &s;tripping them of their temporalities, and &s;ettling pen&s;ions on them; that they might not be in|cumbered with &s;ecular affairs.</P>
<P>Henry knew well the meaning of this language; and alluded to it, when he told Sir Thomas Seymour, he <HI>wanted to have a finger in church matters.</HI></P>
<P>But tho Henry would not allow his courtiers to &s;trip the clergy of their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, he was very well inclined to do it him&s;elf. His method was, to oblige the bi&s;hops to make di&s;advantageous exchanges with crown lands. In this way he &s;trip|ped the fee of Canterbury, during arch|bi&s;hop
<PB N="108" REF="124">Cranraer's time, of 150&pound;. of an|nual rent; and the archbi&s;hop would often hint, that if he were le&s;s ho&s;pitable, than his predece&s;&s;ors, a rea&s;on might be given.</P>
<P>During the &s;hort remainder of Henry's reign, the archbi&s;hop met with no farther di&s;turbance of any kind; his enemies being now convinced of the king's re&s;olu|tion to &s;kreen him from all attacks. In|deed the protection, which Henry at all times afforded him, in oppo&s;ition to his own irritable and implacable temper, the genius of his religion, and the bias of bigotry, makes one of tho&s;e &s;trange con|tradictions, which we &s;ometimes meet with, but cannot account for, in the cha|racters of men.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat &s;ingular, that Henry, on one of the&s;e late attacks, ob&s;erving the mildne&s;s of the primate's temper, the acrimony of his adver&s;aries, and the danger he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily run, when de|prived of the protection of his prince, gave him for his arms, as if in the &s;pirit
<PB N="109" REF="125">of fore&s;ight, three pelicans feeding their young with their own blood: and added, in an odd jumble of coar&s;e metaphor, <Q>That he was likely to be ta&s;ted, if he &s;tood to his tackling.</Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t act of this reign was an act of blood; and gave the archbi&s;hop a noble opportunity of &s;hewing how well he had learned that great Chri&s;tian le&s;&s;on of for|giving an enemy.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t without the &s;hadow of ju&s;tice, Henry had given directions to have the duke of Norfolk attainted by an act of parliament. The king's mandate &s;tood in lieu of guilt; and the bill pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e with great ea&s;e.</P>
<P>No man, except the bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, had been &s;o great an enemy to the archbi&s;hop, as the duke of Norfolk. He had always thwarted the primate's mea&s;ures; and oftener than once had practi&s;ed again&s;t his life. How many would have &s;een with &s;ecret plea&s;ure the workings of Providence again&s;t &s;o ran|corous an enemy; &s;atisfied in having
<PB N="110" REF="126">them&s;elves no hand in his unju&s;t fate! But the archbi&s;hop &s;aw the affair in another light: he &s;aw it with horror; and altho the king had in a particular man|ner intere&s;ted him&s;elf in this bu&s;ine&s;s, the primate oppo&s;ed the bill with all his might; and when his oppo&s;ition was vain, he left the hou&s;e with indignation; and retired to Croydon.</P>
<P>While the king was pu&s;hing on the attainder of the duke of Norfolk, with &s;uch unju&s;t, and cruel precipitancy, he was him&s;elf ha&s;tening apace to the grave. He had long been an object of di&s;gu&s;t, and terror. His body was become a ma&s;s of fetid humours; and his temper was &s;o brutal, that if he had not been diverted by a &s;tratagem, he would have put his queen to death, only for differing from him on a point of theology&mdash;a queen too, who&s;e daily employment it was, to fit for hours on her knees before him, dre&s;&s;ing the offen&s;ive ulcers of his legs. His attendants approached him with trem|bling. One or two of them ran the ri&s;k
<PB N="111" REF="127">of lo&s;ing their heads, only for intimating their fears about his health. It was progno&s;ticating his death; and amounted nearly to high-trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Di&s;ea&s;e at length &s;ubdued this brutal &s;pirit. When he was now almo&s;t in the article of death, Sir Anthony Denny ventured to. hint, with great delicacy, that his phy&s;icians thought his maje&s;ty's life in &s;ome danger. Henry took the admonition patiently, for he felt nature &s;peaking a le&s;s ceremonious language within. He was ju&s;t able to order the archbi&s;hop to be called.</P>
<P>When the primate came, he found the king &s;peechle&s;s, extended on a couch, his eyes glazed, and motionle&s;s. His attendants had ventured now to throw off all di&s;gui&s;e; and the real &s;entiments of the heart, on this great occa&s;ion, were vi&s;ible on every inlightened countenance. The archbi&s;hop's &s;en&s;ations were very different. His were the painful feelings, which ari&s;e from pity mingled with a high &s;en&s;e of gratitude, where there could be no real e&s;teem; and where, in an hour of the greate&s;t. di&s;tre&s;s, there was no po&s;&s;ibi|lity
<PB N="112" REF="128">of being of &s;ervice. With an eye melting in tenderne&s;s, he leaned over the dying king; and &s;ympathized with every pang. Henry did not yet &s;eem entirely deprived of intellect. The primate begged him to give &s;ome &s;ign of his dying in the faith of Chri&s;t. Henry made an effort to gra&s;p his hand, and expired.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>The death of Henry, which hap|pened in the year 1547, opened a new &s;cene. On producing his will, it ap|peared, that &s;ixteen of the leading men of the kingdom were appointed regents. They were re&s;trained by many limitations; but under the&s;e, a majority were allowed <HI>to govern the kingdom as they thought fit.</HI> This happy clau&s;e overturned all the re&s;t. Henry had compo&s;ed the regents, as equally as he could, of both parties in religion; and hoped, that by keeping things, during his &s;on's minority, in the
<PB N="113" REF="129">&s;ame he&s;itating &s;ituation, in which he had left them, he might prevent their running into extremes. But it happened otherwi&s;e. A majority plainly inclined to the prote&s;tant cau&s;e, either from con&s;cience, or intere&s;t; and they thought them&s;elves fully authorized by the pre|cept of the will, <HI>to govern the king|dom as they thought fit.</HI> The earl of Hertford, the king's uncle, was created duke of Somer&s;et, and cho&s;en protector. The other regents immediately became cyphers.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop, tho placed at the head of the regency, rarely interfered with &s;tate affairs; and gave little interruption to the ambition of his compeers. In eccle&s;i|a&s;tical matters he took the lead: and every thing, that was done, in this de|partment, during Edward's reign, may be con&s;idered as done by his authority.</P>
<P>But it would interfere too much with the nature of &s;uch a work as this, to enter into a minute detail of all the changes, which were made in religion.
<PB N="114" REF="130">Such a detail appears more properly in works appropriated to the&s;e inquiries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Jewel's apology, Burnet's hi&s;t. of the reform. Heylin's eccle&s;. hi&s;t. &amp;c.</NOTE>. Here it is propo&s;ed only to illu&s;trate the character of this excellent prelate; and it will be enough to touch &s;o far on the changes he made, as to throw a proper light on his wi&s;dom, prudence, learning, moderation, and &s;irmne&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep he took, regarded the &s;ettlement of the &s;upremacy; a point, which he had exceedingly at heart, as the foundation of every thing el&s;e. He formally therefore petitioned the young king, that as he had exerci&s;ed the office of archbi&s;hop under his father, he might be permitted to exerci&s;e it under him: and he would perform no epi&s;copal duty, till his new licence was made out.&mdash;This example, he propo&s;ed &s;hould be inforced on the clergy.</P>
<P>Thus authorized he proceeded to the affairs of religion. But before any thing was done, he thought it right to &s;hew the
<PB N="115" REF="131">nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;omething: and to this purpo&s;e a general vi&s;itation was made. Abu&s;es of all kinds were inquired into&mdash;corrupt doctrines; corrupt practices; &s;u|per&s;titious ceremonies; the lives of the clergy; and the manners of the laity, The vi&s;itors had authority to proceed a &s;tep farther. In flagrant ca&s;es a few cen|&s;ures were pa&s;&s;ed; and a few injunctions given. The idea was to re&s;train, rather than to aboli&s;h, the old &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Among other things it was thought expedient to &s;u&s;pend preaching. Amid&s;t the licence of the times, no &s;pecies of it de&s;erved more reproof, than that which had gotten po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pulpit. Many of the monks had been &s;ecularized; and bringing with them into their churches their old mona&s;tic ideas, the popular divinity of tho&s;e times was, if po&s;&s;ible, more oppo&s;ite to &s;cripture, and more offea&s;ive to common &s;en&s;e, than it had ever been in the darke&s;t reign of po|pery. In the room of preaching, a book of homilies was publi&s;hed, and ordered to be read in churches. The u&s;e of &s;cripture al&s;o was allowed; and that the people
<PB N="116" REF="132">might have an explanation of it at hand, the commentary of Era&s;mus was autho|rized.&mdash;The&s;e changes had great effi|cacy; moderate as they appeared, and aiming rather to undermine the founda|tions of popery, than to overturn them by any open a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>The minds of the people indeed were, in a good degree, prepared for them; and it is &s;aid, nothing contributed more to loo&s;en their prejudices, than a popular paper, which was publi&s;hed, about the clo&s;e of the late reign, intitled, <HI>The &s;up|plication of the poor commons to the king.</HI> It was levelled chiefly at the ignorance, and immorality of the Romi&s;h clergy; and being written in a ma&s;terly manner; and inter&s;per&s;ed with a variety of lively anecdotes, it was much read; and tended greatly to give the people ju&s;t ideas of the clerical office. Among other &s;tories the following very curious one is related. <Q>A certain court-chaplain, who had great preferment, ob&s;erved, as he was travelling, a church upon a fair hill,
<PB N="117" REF="133">be&s;et with groves, and fields, the green meadows lying beneath on the banks of a river, garni&s;hed with willows, poplars, and alders. He was mightily taken with the place, and calling out to his &s;ervant, Robin, &s;aid he, this benefice &s;tandeth plea&s;antly. I would it were mine. Why, Sir, &s;aid his &s;er|vant, it is your's; and immediately named the pari&s;h&mdash;If your highne&s;s had &s;o many &s;wine in this realm, as you have men, would you commit the keeping of them to &s;uch &s;wine-herds, as did not know their &s;wine-cots, when they &s;aw them?</Q></P>
<P>The dread, in which the Romi&s;h clergy were at that time thrown, from what had been already done, is &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed in the following language. <Q>The&s;e dumb dogs have learned to fawn upon
them, who bring them bread; and to be wonderful fri&s;ky when they are che|ri&s;hed: but if they be once bid to <HI>couch,</HI> they draw the tail between their legs, and get them &s;trait to their kennel: and then, come who will, they &s;tir no more, till they hear their fire pope cry
<PB N="118" REF="134">out, hey, cut, or long tail. So afraid are they of &s;tripes, and le&s;t they &s;hould be tied up &s;o &s;hort, that they cannot range abroad; nor worry, now and then, a lamb.</Q></P>
<P>Then follows a long account of their rapacity, of which many in&s;tances are given. Among others, we are told, <Q>it was no rare thing to &s;ee poor people beg at Ea&s;ter, to pay for the &s;acrament, when they receive it. Nor is it le&s;s common to &s;ee men beg for dead bodies, that they may pay the prie&s;t's dues. It is not long &s;ince, in the city of London, a dead body was brought to the church to be buried; being &s;o poor, that it was almo&s;t quite naked. But the&s;e charitable men, who teach us, that it is one of the works of mercy to bury the dead, would not bury this dead corps, without their dues. So they cau&s;ed it to be carried into the &s;treet, till the poor people, who dwelled there, begged &s;o much as the dues came to.</Q></P>
<P>The apo&s;trophe of the&s;e &s;uppliants to the king was very noble, and &s;pirited.
<PB N="119" REF="135"><Q>If you &s;uffer Chri&s;t's poor members to be thus oppre&s;&s;ed, expect the righteous judgment of God for your negligence. Be merciful therefore to your&s;elf, as well as to us. Endanger not your own &s;oul by the &s;uffering of us poor com|mons. Remember that your hoar hairs are a token, that nature maketh ha&s;te to ab&s;olve your life. Defer not then, mo&s;t dread &s;overeign, the reformation of the&s;e enormities. For the wound is even unto death. Whoredom is more e&s;teemed than wedlock. Simony hath lo&s;t its name. U&s;ury is lawful gains. What example of life do the people &s;hew this day, which declares us more to be the people of God, than Jews, and Mahometans?</Q></P>
<P>The leaders of the popi&s;h party ea&s;ily &s;aw the tendency of the primate's mea|&s;ures; and gave them what oppo&s;ition they were able. The Bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter never appeared in a more becoming light, With equal firmne&s;s, and plau&s;i|bility he remon&s;trated. <Q>The com|mencement
<PB N="120" REF="136">of a minority, he &s;aid, was not a time to introduce novelties. To alter the religion of a country was a &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s; and required the ut|mo&s;t deliberation. No act of legi&s;lature, he ob&s;erved, had yet pa&s;&s;ed; and it was great pre&s;umption to publi&s;h things under the king's name; with which, it was well known, neither he, nor the protector, were at all acquainted. But even if bare decency were con&s;ulted, it was very offen&s;ive to all &s;ober men to &s;ee the wi&s;dom of ages cancelled in a few months.&mdash;The paraphra&s;e of Era&s;mus, he remarked, was written at a time, when the pen of that writer was very licentious. It contained many points of doctrine, which, he pre&s;umed, the prote&s;tants them&s;elves would not willingly inculcate; and he would maintain, that it contradicted the homilies in many par|ticulars. As for the homilies, tho he did not doubt their being well intend|ed, yet they were certainly very inac|curate compo&s;itions; and ran into length on many curious points of doc|trine, which tended rather to mi&s;lead,
<PB N="121" REF="137">than to inform the people.&mdash;For him|&s;elf, he &s;aid, he was carele&s;s of all con|&s;equences, which the freedom of his &s;peech might draw upon him. The la&s;t &s;cene of his life was now on the &s;tage; and he only wi&s;hed to conclude it properly.</Q></P>
<P>There was an energy, and greatne&s;s in this language, &s;uperior to any thing, that had ever fallen from Gardiner: and if that had been the la&s;t &s;cene of his life, we mu&s;t have acknowledged the dignity of it's conclu&s;ion. In his objections al&s;o there was more than a &s;hew of rea&s;oning; and the promoters of reformation had but an indifferent ground for a defence. They an&s;wered with the plainne&s;s and &s;impli|city of hone&s;t men (which was the be&s;t defence they could make), that they were a&s;&s;ured their amendments were right on the whole; and that if &s;ome things were objectionable, the&s;e too &s;hould be amend|ed, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This was a better an&s;wer; and more in the &s;pirit of reformation, than their replying, as they afterwards did, to the arguments of Winche&s;ter, by throwing
<PB N="122" REF="138">him into pri&s;on. This violent mea&s;ure may well be reckoned among the errors of tho&s;e times. The archbi&s;hop indeed does not appear to have had any hand in this affair. It i&s;&s;ued &s;olely from the council; and was intended probably to remove Winche&s;ter from the parliament, which was then about to be a&s;&s;embled. In every light, political or religious, it was a har&s;h, di&s;cordant mea&s;ure; and very unworthy of the liberal cau&s;e, which it was intended to &s;erve.</P>

<P>On the fourth of November 1547, about nine months after Henry's death, a parliament was a&s;&s;embled; and the lea|ders of the prote&s;tant cau&s;e hoped to make it the in&s;trument of &s;till more e&s;&s;ential alterations, than any they had yet made. Indeed, the bias of the nation leaned more to this &s;ide. Such a change ap|peared in the opinions of men, &s;ince the
<PB N="123" REF="139">la&s;t parliament of Henry, that no one could imagine the two a&s;&s;emblies were compo&s;ed of the &s;ame people. In every debate the prote&s;tant took the lead; and drew over a majority. In that age of novelty, when the general principles of men were unfixed, it was an ea&s;y matter to per&s;uade tho&s;es who were incapable of rational inquiry. The convocation, ani|mated by the archbi&s;hop, &s;hewed the &s;ame &s;pirit; and dige&s;ted bu&s;ine&s;s for the par|liament. The act of the fix articles was repealed: communion in both kinds was allowed: tradition was di&s;credited.: lent was con&s;idered as a political in&s;titution: the liturgy was ordered to be new mo|delled; an ea&s;y catechi&s;m to be framed; and the canon law to be reformed.</P>
<P>The&s;e things however were not all done at this time: but I mention them together, as the principal acts of parlia|ment, and of convocation, during this &s;hort reign.</P>
<P>In framing the catechi&s;m, and new mo|delling the liturgy, and the canon law, the archbi&s;hop had the chief hand. The la&s;t indeed he had attempted in the late
<PB N="124" REF="140">reign: but the prevalence of the popi&s;h party obliged him to leave that u&s;eful work unfini&s;hed. He now undertook it in earne&s;t and not being &s;atisfied with making it an accurate, and judicious per|formance, he endeavoured to make it even elegant. Dr. Haddon was e&s;teemed at that time, the be&s;t latini&s;t in England; and the archbi&s;hop engaged him to re|vi&s;e the language of his performance. Several of Haddon's corrections may yet be &s;een in the original manu&s;cript; which is &s;till extant in Bennet-college in Cam|bridge. <HI>Mulierum a partu,</HI> is altered into <HI>Levatarum puerperarum:</HI> and <HI>cuicunq hoc proerogativum e&s;t,</HI> into <HI>cuicunq hoc pecu|liare jus tribuitur, quod proerogativum vo|cant.</HI>&mdash;But &s;uch was the fatality attending this u&s;eful work, that it was prevented taking effect in Edward's, as it had been in Henry's reign: it was not &s;ufficiently prepared to be brought forward, before that king's immature death.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop endeavoured al&s;o to con|fine the office of confirmation, as much as
<PB N="125" REF="141">he could to adults. He &s;aw little u&s;e in admini&s;tering it to children. But when people were come to years of di&s;cretion; and &s;eriou&s;ly de&s;ired to renew their bap|ti&s;mal vow, he thought the &s;olemnity of &s;uch an ordinance, at that time, might make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Some other changes he made of &s;maller import; but &s;till with that admirable cau|tion, and prudence, which marked all his proceedings.</P>
<P>His caution however did not pa&s;s wholly uncen&s;ured. Many of his friends con|ceived, that he might have taken ha&s;tier &s;teps. The zeal of Calvin in particular took offence. That reformer wrote his &s;entiments very freely to the archbi&s;hop; and wi&s;hed him to pu&s;h matters with a little more &s;pirit. He put him in mind of his age, which could not long allow him to continue his u&s;eful labours; and feared, that on his death, an opportunity would be lo&s;t, which might never be re|covered. The archbi&s;hop an&s;wered his letter with great kindne&s;s&mdash;reminded him of the many difficulties he had &s;till to oppo&s;e; and endeavoured to convince him
<PB N="126" REF="142">of the great imprudence of le&s;s cautious mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>While the primate was thus aboli&s;hing the e&s;&s;entials of popery, it may be &s;up|po&s;ed, he did not &s;uffer it's pageantry to pa&s;s unob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The frequency of proce&s;&s;ions was be|come a great abu&s;e. Men began to think nothing was religion, but what was an object of fight. This &s;hews, how much they have to an&s;wer for, who introduce needle&s;s ceremonies into the offices of any religious e&s;tabli&s;hment. The minds of the people at the time we are now de|&s;cribing, fa&s;cinated with pomp, and &s;plen|dor, &s;aw with le&s;s reluctance the founda|tions of popery &s;haken, than the o&s;tenta|tious ceremonies aboli&s;hed of carrying palms on Palm-Sunday, or a&s;hes on A&s;h-Wedne&s;day.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume treating the&s;e alterations with levity, attributes them to the mo|ro&s;e humour of the reformers; and in&s;i|nuates, that it is happy when &s;uper&s;ti|tion, (which is generally with him ano|ther
<PB N="127" REF="143">word for religion), takes this in|offen&s;ive turn.&mdash;When Mr. Hume rears the &s;tandard of infidelity, and boldly combats the truths of religion, he acts openly, and hone&s;tly: but when he &s;catters his carele&s;s in&s;inuations, as he traver&s;es the paths of hi&s;tory, we cha|racterize him as a dark, in&s;idious enemy.</P>
<P>During the debates on the&s;e &s;ubjects, a very extraordinary phenomenon appeared in the hou&s;e of lords&mdash;the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury at the head of the popi&s;h peers, and popi&s;h bi&s;hops, contending eagerly again&s;t the whole force of the prote&s;tant intere&s;t. The point in di&s;pute, was the propriety of granting a large parcel of collegiate, and chantry lands to the king's u&s;e. Had it been intended to employ this grant in any u&s;eful work, the archbi&s;hop would readily have given his vote for it: but he knew well what direction it would take; and he wi&s;hed the lands rather to continue as they were, hoping for better times, than have them fall into the hands of rapacious courtiers.
<PB N="128" REF="144">He had the morti&s;ication however to &s;ee his opponents prevail.</P>
<P>While this bill was depending in the hou&s;e, the two univer&s;ities, which were clearly comprehended in the letter of it, became very apprehen&s;ive; and made powerful interce&s;&s;ion at court to avert the danger. Whether the primate intere&s;ted him&s;elf in their favour on this occa&s;ion, does not appear: it is rather probable that he did, as we find him intere&s;ting him&s;elf for them on many other occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>They were, at that time, little more, than nur&s;eries of &s;loth, &s;uper&s;tition, and ignorance; and not many degrees rai&s;ed above the monki&s;h in&s;titutions, which had lately been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Many inge|nious men, and &s;cholars of great repute|tion, were among them; but they were yet &s;o thinly &s;cattered in the &s;everal col|leges, as to have little influence in form|ing the general character of the univer|&s;ities: and they who wi&s;hed well to the&s;e foundations, ea&s;ily &s;aw this corruption mu&s;t terminate in their ruin; and de&s;ired
<PB N="129" REF="145">to avert it. The archbi&s;hop always thought him&s;elf much intere&s;ted in the welfare of both the univer&s;ities, but of Cambridge in particular; and tho he does not appear to have had any legal power there, yet &s;uch was his intere&s;t at court, and &s;uch was the general dependence of the more eminent members of that &s;ociety upon him, that &s;carce any thing was done there, either of a public, or a private nature, without con&s;ulting him. It was his chief endeavour to encourage, as much as po&s;&s;ible, a &s;pirit of inquiry; and to rou&s;e the &s;tudents from the &s;lumber of their predece&s;&s;ors; well knowing, the <HI>libertas philo&s;ophandi</HI> was the great mean of detecting error, and that true learning could never be at variance with true reli|gion. A&s;cham, and Cheke, two of the mo&s;t elegant &s;cholars of that age, were chiefly relied on, and con&s;ulted by the archbi&s;hop in this work.</P>

<P>While the primate was acting this great, and good part; and on all occa&s;ions di&s;covering the utmo&s;t mildne&s;s and can|dour; the truth of hi&s;tory calls on us to acknowledge, that on one unhappy occa|&s;ion, he appeared under a very different character; that of a bigotted per&s;ecutor. It is very true indeed, that he went not voluntarily into this bu&s;ine&s;s; but acted under a commi&s;&s;ion to inquire into here|tical opinions.</P>
<P>When the errors of the church of Rome were &s;crutinized; private judg|ment, altho the ba&s;is of all liberal in|quiry, gave birth, as might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, to a variety of &s;trange enthu&s;i|a&s;tic opinions. Many of the&s;e were un|que&s;tionably ab&s;urd enough; and &s;ome of them de&s;tructive of moral goodne&s;s: as that, the elect could not &s;in&mdash;that altho the outward man might tran&s;gre&s;s, the in|ward
<PB N="131" REF="147">man remained immaculate&mdash;that the regenerate have a right to what they want; and &s;ome others, equally dete&s;ta|ble.&mdash;They were opinions however of a le&s;s offen&s;ive nature, that drew upon them the archbi&s;hop's &s;everity.</P>
<P>Joan Bocher, and George Paris were accu&s;ed, tho at different times, one for denying the humanity of Chri&s;t; the other for denying his divinity. They were both tried, and condemned to the &s;take: and the archbi&s;hop not only con|&s;ented to the&s;e acts of blood; but even per&s;uaded the aver&s;ion of the young king into a compliance. "Your maje&s;ty mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h (&s;aid he, informing his royal pupil's con&s;cience) between common opinions, and &s;uch, as are the e&s;&s;ential articles of faith. The&s;e latter we mu&s;t on no account &s;uffer to be oppo&s;ed."</P>
<P>It is true, the&s;e doctrines, e&s;pecially the latter, in the opinion of the generality of chri&s;tians, are &s;ubver&s;ive of the funda|mentals of chri&s;tianity. To deny the divinity of Chri&s;t &s;eems to oppo&s;e the general idea, which the &s;criptures hold out of our redemption. On the other
<PB N="132" REF="148">hand, many particular pa&s;&s;ages, which de&s;cribe the humanity of Chri&s;t, &s;eem to favour the doctrine: and &s;ome there are, who hold it even in this inlightened age. At wor&s;t therefore we mu&s;t con&s;ider it, as an erroneous opinion. To call it here&s;y, when attended with a good life, is cer|tainly a great breach of chri&s;tian charity. Is it not then a&s;toni&s;hing, that a man of the archbi&s;hop's candour could not give it a little more indulgence? If any opinions can demand the &s;ecular arm, it mu&s;t be &s;uch only, as lead to actions, which in|jure the peace of &s;ociety. We are &s;ur|prized al&s;o at &s;eeing the archbi&s;hop &s;o far depreciate his own cau&s;e, as to &s;up|po&s;e that one man incurred guilt by act|ing on the &s;ame principles, which inti|tled another to applau&s;e: and that he who in the opinion of one church, was the greate&s;t of &s;chi&s;matics him&s;elf, &s;hould not even in common ju&s;tice indulge, in all the more &s;peculative points of religion, tole|ration to others. Nothing even plau&s;ible can be &s;ugge&s;ted in defence of the arch|bi&s;hop on this occa&s;ion; except only that the &s;pirit of popery was not yet wholly repre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="149">There are however, among prote&s;tant writers at this day, &s;ome who have under|taken his vindication. But I &s;pare their indi&s;cretion. Let the horrid act be uni|ver&s;ally di&s;claimed. To palliate, is, to participate. With indignation let it be recorded, as what above all other things has di&s;graced that religious liberty, which our ance&s;tors in mo&s;t other re&s;pects &s;o nobly purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>From this di&s;agreeable view of the archbi&s;hop let us endeavour to bring our|&s;elves again in temper with him, by viewing him as the friend and patron of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. The &s;u&s;&s;ering profe&s;&s;ors of prote&s;tanti&s;m, who were &s;cattered in great numbers about the various countries of Europe, were always &s;ure of an a&s;ylum with him. His palace at Lambeth might be called a &s;eminary of learned men; the greater part of whom per&s;ecution had driven from home. Here among other celebrated reformers, Martyr, Bucer, Ale&s;s, Phage &s;ound &s;anctuary. Martyr, Bucer, and Phage were liberally pen&s;ioned
<PB N="134" REF="150">by the archbi&s;hop, till he could other|wi&s;e provide for them. It was his wi&s;h to fix them in the two univer&s;ities, where he hoped their great knowledge, and &s;pirit of inquiry, would forward his de|&s;igns of re&s;toring learning: and he at length obtained profe&s;&s;or&s;hips for them all. Bucer and Phage, were &s;ettled at Cam|bridge; were they only &s;hewed what might have been expected from them, both dying within a few months after their arrival. But at Oxford Martyr acted a very con&s;picuous part; and con|tributed to introduce among the &s;tudents there a very liberal mode of thinking.</P>
<P>Ale&s;s had been driven from Scotland, his native country, for the novelty of his opinions. The cau&s;e in which he &s;uffer|ed, added to his abilities and learning, &s;o far recommended him to the univer&s;ity of Leip&s;ic, to which he retired, that he was cho&s;en a profe&s;&s;or there. At this place he became acquainted with Melancthon, who having written a treati&s;e on &s;ome part of the controver&s;y between the papi&s;ts, and prote&s;tants, was de&s;irous of con&s;ulting the archbi&s;hop on a few points; and en|gaged
<PB N="135" REF="151">Ale&s;s, otherwi&s;e not aver&s;e to the employment, to undertake a voyage into England for that purpo&s;e. In the cour&s;e of the conference, the archbi&s;hop. was &s;o much taken with his &s;implicity, and learning, that he &s;ettled a pen&s;ion on him; and retained him in his family.</P>
<P>The misfortunes of the times drew Ala&s;co al&s;o into England, where the archbi&s;hop became an early patron to him; and &s;hewed on this occa&s;ion at lea&s;t, the candour, and liberality of his &s;entiments, by permitting a per&s;on, who held many opinions very different from his own, to collect his brethren, and &s;uch as cho&s;e to communicate with him, into a church. At the head of this little a&s;&s;embly Ala&s;co long pre&s;ided; exhibiting an eminent example of piety, and decency of man|ners.</P>
<P>Among other learned foreigners John Sleiden was under particular obligations to the archbi&s;hop. Sleiden was, at that time, engaged in writing the hi&s;tory of the reformation; a work from which much was expected; and which the arch|bi&s;hop, by allowing him a pen&s;ion, and
<PB N="136" REF="152">opportunities of &s;tudy, enabled him to pro&s;ecute with le&s;s difficulty, than had attended the beginning of his labours.</P>
<P>Leland, the fir&s;t Briti&s;h antiquarian, was al&s;o among the primate's particular friends. Leland had a wonderful facility in learning languages; and was e&s;teemed the fir&s;t lingui&s;t in Europe. The arch|bi&s;hop &s;oon took notice of him, and with his u&s;ual di&s;cernment, recommended him to be the king's librarian. His genius threw him on the &s;tudy of antiquities; and his opportunities, on tho&s;e of his own country: the archbi&s;hop, in the mean time, by procuring preferment for him, enabled him to make tho&s;e inquiries, to which his countrymen have been &s;o much indebted.</P>
<P>Among others, who were under obli|gations to the archbi&s;hop's genero&s;ity, was the amiable bi&s;hop Latimer; who not choo&s;ing to be rein&s;tated in his old bi&s;hoprick, and having made but an in|different provi&s;ion for his future nece&s;&s;i|ties, &s;pent a great part of his latter life with the archbi&s;hop, at Lambeth.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="153">Be&s;ides this intimacy with learned men at home, the archbi&s;hop held a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence with mo&s;t of the learned men in Europe.</P>
<P>The great patron of Era&s;mus had been archbi&s;hop Warham; than whom, to give popery its due, few churchmen of tho&s;e times led a more apo&s;tolical life. When Cranmer &s;ucceeded Warham, Era&s;mus was in the decline of age. He found, however, during the &s;hort time he lived, as beneficent a friend under the new arch|bi&s;hop, as he had lo&s;t in the old one.</P>
<P>The primate corre&s;ponded al&s;o with O&s;iander, Melancthon, and Calvin. His foreign corre&s;pondence indeed was &s;o large that he appointed a per&s;on with a &s;alary at Canterbury, who&s;e chief employment it was, to forward, and receive his packets.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t eminent of his corre|&s;pondents was Herman, archbi&s;hop and elector of Cologn. This prelate had been early impre&s;&s;ed with the principles of the reformation by Melancthon; and had u&s;ed all his influence to introduce them in his electorate. But he met with powerful oppo&s;ition; the pope and emperor com|bining
<PB N="138" REF="154">again&s;t him, the former in his &s;pi|ritual, the latter in his temporal capacity. So potent a combination cru&s;hed him. Terms indeed were offered; but he would hearken to no di&s;honourable compromi&s;e. <Q>Nothing, he would &s;ay, can happen to me unexpectedly: I have long &s;ince for|ti&s;ied my mind again&s;t every event.</Q> In&s;tead of a &s;plendid life therefore, at va|riance with his opinions; he cho&s;e a pri|vate &s;tation; in which he enjoyed the plea&s;ures of &s;tudy; the friend&s;hip of good men; and the tranquility of a good con|&s;cience.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVI.</HEAD>
<P>In the year 1549, the archbi&s;hop was engaged in a controver&s;y of a very &s;in|gular kind, on the following occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;olution of mona&s;teries, having thrown the landed intere&s;t of the nation, into new hands, introduced al&s;o a new kind of culture; which at fir&s;t occa&s;ioned
<PB N="139" REF="155">a &s;carcity. Mr. Hume, &s;peaking of this matter, with great judgment remarks, <Q>that no abu&s;e in civil &s;ociety is &s;o great, as not to be attended with a variety of beneficial con&s;equences; and in the be|ginnings of reformation, the lo&s;s of the&s;e advantages is always felt very &s;en&s;ibly; while the benefit re&s;ulting from the change, is the &s;low effect of time; and is &s;eldom perceived by the bulk of a na|tion.</Q> Thus, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, the bad effects of a new mode of culture were experienced, before its advantages took place; and the people expre&s;&s;ing di&s;&s;|atisfaction in all parts, in &s;ome flamed out into acts of violence. Among other in&s;urrections, one in Devon&s;hire was very formidable. The in&s;urgents felt the effects of famine, but in an age of ignorance they could not trace the cau&s;e. The di&s;con|tented prie&s;ts, who &s;warmed about the country, pre&s;ently a&s;&s;igned one. <Q>The famin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was a judgment for the abolition of the holy catholic religion; and till that was re&s;tored, the people mu&s;t not look either for &s;eed-time, or harve&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="156">Such language changed riot into en|thu&s;ia&s;m. The banner of the cro&s;s was reared; and the in&s;urgents, marking them|&s;elves with the five wounds of Chri&s;t, cal|led their march, <HI>the pilgrimage of grace.</HI></P>
<P>Their fir&s;t attempt was on Exeter, which they &s;urrounded with their tumul|tuary forces. The town was reduced to extremity; but &s;till re&s;i&s;ted; encouraged chiefly by a brave old town&s;man, who bringing all his provi&s;ion into the &s;treet, <Q>Here, cried he, my fellow-citizens, take what I have, among you. For my|&s;elf, I will &s;ight with one arm, and feed on the other, rather than &s;uffer the&s;e ruffians to enter.</Q></P>
<P>As the rebels were thus checked by the firmne&s;s of Exeter, they employed this time of inactivity in &s;ending petitions and articles to the king, in which they demand|ed, the ceremonies of the popi&s;h wor&s;hip to be re&s;tored&mdash;the new liturgy to be abo|li&s;hed&mdash;the u&s;e of the bible to be forbid|den&mdash;and, in &s;hort, every thing to be undone, that had already been done.</P>
<P>General an&s;wers were given to the&s;e demands; but the rebels continuing &s;till
<PB N="141" REF="157">un&s;atisfied, Lord Ru&s;&s;el was &s;ent again&s;t them with a body of forces. He fell on them, as they lay before Exeter; and gave them a &s;evere defeat.</P>
<P>But tho their &s;pirit was broken, their prejudices continued. The archbi&s;hop therefore engaged in the humane part of bringing them to rea&s;on: hoping that their &s;ufferings had, by this time, abated the ar|dour of their zeal.</P>
<P>The articles of their petitions, relating to religion, which were fifteen in number, the archbi&s;hop undertook to an&s;wer. The fir&s;t rough draught of this work, which is of con&s;iderable length, is &s;till extant in the library of Bennet-college in Cambridge, and is publi&s;hed by Mr. Strype in his ap|pendix to the life of archbi&s;hop Cranmer. It contains a very exten&s;ive compa&s;s of learning; and is written with great &s;trength of argument: but its principal recommend|dation is, its being &s;o admirably adapted to the capacity of tho&s;e, to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed. Nothing can &s;hew more judg|ment or knowledge of the manners of the lower people.&mdash;I &s;hall give the reader a
<PB N="142" REF="158">few pa&s;&s;ages from this very ma&s;terly work, as a &s;pecimen.</P>
<P>The rebel articles begin with the phra&s;e, <HI>We will have.</HI></P>
<P>"In the fir&s;t place, &s;ays the archbi&s;hop, I di&s;like your beginning. Is it the fa&s;hion of &s;ubjects to &s;ay to their prince, <HI>We will have?</HI> Would any of you, that be hou&s;e-holders, be content, that your &s;ervants &s;hould come upon you with harne&s;s on their backs, and &s;words in their hands, and &s;ay, <HI>We will have?</HI></P>
<P>But leaving your rude, and unhand&s;ome manner of &s;peech, I will come to the point. You &s;ay <HI>you will have all the holy decrees to be ob&s;erved.</HI> But I dare &s;ay, very few, or none of you, under&s;tand what you a&s;k. Do you know what the holy decrees be? As <HI>holy</HI> as they may be cal|led, they be indeed &s;o wicked, and full of tyranny, that the like were never devi&s;ed. I &s;hall rehear&s;e &s;ome of them, that you may &s;ee how holy they be.&mdash;One decree &s;ayth, <HI>That all the decrees of the bi&s;hop of Rome ought to be kept as God's word.</HI> Ano|ther, that <HI>who&s;oever receiveth not the decrees of the bi&s;hop of Rome, his &s;in &s;hall never be
<PB N="143" REF="159">forgiven.</HI> A third, that <HI>altho the bi&s;hop of Rome regard neither his own &s;alvation, nor any man's el&s;e, but puts down with him&s;elf, headlong innumerable people, by heaps, into hell; yet may no mortal man pre&s;ume to re|prove him therefore.</HI> I cannot think that you be &s;o far from all godline&s;s, as to de|&s;ire decrees, which be &s;o bla&s;phemous to God; and &s;o far from all equity and rea|&s;on. For I dare &s;ay, that the &s;ubtle pa|pi&s;ts when they moved you to &s;tand in this article, that <HI>all holy decrees &s;hould be ob&s;er|ved,</HI> never &s;hewed you the&s;e decrees: &s;or if they had, they knew right well, you would never have con&s;ented to this arti|cle.</P>
<P>But now let me &s;hew you, what a mi&s;e|rable ca&s;e you &s;hould bring your&s;elves into, if the king's maje&s;ty &s;hould a&s;&s;ent unto this fir&s;t article. For among the&s;e decrees, one is, that <HI>no prie&s;t &s;hall be &s;ued before a temporal judge for any manner of cau&s;e or crime; but before his bi&s;hop only.</HI> Another is, that <HI>a prie&s;t may &s;ue a temporal man ei|ther before a temporal, or a &s;piritual judge, at his plea&s;ure.</HI> I cannot deny, but the&s;e be good, and beneficial decrees for the li|berty

<P>The exten&s;ive corre&s;pondence a|broad, in which the archbi&s;hop was enga|ged, and the many applications, he received from all parts, put him, at this time, (about the year 1546) on a &s;cheme, which he had greatly at heart&mdash;the union of all the prote&s;tant churches in Europe.</P>
<P>They were all united again&s;t the preten|&s;ions of the church of Rome: but in no other point, were they perfectly harmo|nious. Their wide&s;t differences however
<PB N="147" REF="163">regarded the &s;acraments, divine decrees, and church government. On each of the&s;e heads they held their &s;everal opinions with ob&s;tinacy enough on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e di&s;&s;entions the papi&s;ts took the advantage. <Q>Let the prote&s;tants alone, (was the cry:) they will &s;oon quarrel with the fame acrimony among them|&s;elves, which they have already &s;hewn towards us: and it will pre&s;ently appear; that there can be no criterion of reli|gion; nor peace to Chri&s;tendom, but in the bo&s;om of a mother-church.</Q></P>
<P>Such &s;arca&s;tic reflections hurt the arch|bi&s;hop; as he conceived they injured reli|gion. He earne&s;tly wi&s;hed therefore to remove this block of offence; and to give the cau&s;e he revered, that &s;upport, which next to truth, he thought, union alone could give it. How noble would be the coalition, he would fay, if all the mem|bers of prote&s;tanti&s;m &s;hould unite in one mode of church government; and in one confe&s;&s;ion of faith!</P>
<P>In the &s;outhern parts of France, in Hol|land, and in Germany, the reformation flouri&s;hed chiefly under Calvin, Bullenger,
<PB N="148" REF="164">and Melancthon. To the&s;e eminent re|formers the archbi&s;hop applied with much earne&s;tne&s;s; intreating them to join their endeavours with his, in forwarding this great &s;cheme; and propo&s;ed England as a place, where they might hold their con|&s;ultations with the mod convenience, and the mo&s;t &s;ecurity. The good archbi&s;hop wanted the experience of later times to convince him, how great an impo&s;&s;ibility he attempted. He was not aware, that when private judgment becomes the crite|rion, it will &s;hew it&s;elf of cour&s;e in differ|ent creeds, in different modes of wor&s;hip, and in different forms of church government; which latter will always take their complexion from the &s;tate.&mdash;How little could be expected from this interview, Me|lancthon's an&s;wer might early have convinced him. That reformer, in &s;trong language, applauded the primate's intention, and heartily wi&s;hed it might &s;ucceed. <Q>But, added he, the model you ought to go upon, is certainly that confe&s;&s;ion of faith, which we &s;igned at Au&s;burgh.</Q>&mdash;However liberal that confe&s;&s;ion might be,
<PB N="149" REF="165">there was certainly no liberality in the impo&s;ition of it.</P>
<P>Calvin &s;eems to have expected very lit|tle from this bu&s;ine&s;s. He an&s;wers only in general terms. He profe&s;&s;es that he would cro&s;s ten &s;eas with chearfulne&s;s for the good of Chri&s;tendom, or of the church of England alone; but, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, he pleads his inability; and recom|mends the whole bu&s;ine&s;s to the hands of God.&mdash;This reformer &s;aw deeper into the affair, than our good archbi&s;hop: he not only &s;aw the impracticability of it; but probably thought, with many other learn|ed men, that if the thing had even been practicable, it was by no means advi&s;eable: as different &s;ects would naturally be a check on each other, and might pre&s;erve the church of Chri&s;t from tho&s;e impurities, which the . de&s;poti&s;m of the Roman hierarchy had un|que&s;tionably introduced; and which ano|ther de&s;potic hierarchy might introduce again.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of this projected union, a que&s;tion aro&s;e of great importance;
<PB N="150" REF="166">and which indeed threw many difficulties in the very ve&s;tible of it. The que&s;tion was, whether, in drawing up a confe&s;&s;ion. of faith, definite, or general terms, &s;hould be adopted? The primate, with his u&s;ual candour, pleaded for the greate&s;t latitude. <Q>Let us leave the portal, &s;aid he, as wide as we can; and exclude none, whom it is in our power to comprehend.</Q> He was oppo&s;ed in this argument chiefly by Melancthon; who, tho a mild and gentle reformer on mo&s;t occa&s;ions, wrote with too much animo&s;ity on this; making up in zeal, what he wanted in candour.</P>
<P>Here ended the projected union of the prote&s;tant churches. The trouble&s;ome times, which afterwards broke out in Eng|land, put an end to all farther thoughts of the de&s;ign; after the archbi&s;hop had labour|ed in it full two years to no purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>But altho the primate's moderation failed of its effect abroad, it had fuller &s;cope among the &s;ectaries at home.</P>
<P>When the bible was fir&s;t opened, after men had &s;o long been deprived of it, they were &s;atisfied with reading it &s;imply, and gathering from it a rule of life and man|ners; overlooking que&s;tions of difficulty in the general comfort derived from its promi&s;es; and troubling nobody with their particular opinions. This is ever the gol|den age of religion. But men &s;oon begin to look higher. The vulgar can read their bibles; and learn their duty. The learned mu&s;t do &s;omething more. They mu&s;t unravel knotty points: they mu&s;t broach novel-doctrines; which the people mu&s;t be made to receive, as points of impor|tance: they mu&s;t contradict, and oppo&s;e: they mu&s;t &s;hew them&s;elves, in &s;hort, to be
<PB N="152" REF="168">able champions of religion; and fit to appear at the head of &s;ectaries.</P>
<P>Much of this &s;pirit had already gotten abroad in England; and a variety of cau&s;es concurred in &s;tirring it up. Be|&s;ides the different tenets, which began to appear among the Engli&s;h prote&s;tants them&s;elves; di&s;gu&s;ted papi&s;ts artfully threw in their &s;ubtleties, and di&s;tinctions; and a multitude of religioni&s;ts from Ger|many, Switzerland, and Holland, led by their pa&s;tors, brought over with them multifarious and contradictory creeds. It was then as common for men to migrate for the fake of religion, as it is now for the fake of trade. In a word, all this ma&s;s, dige&s;ting together, began to fer|ment.</P>
<P>If &s;ectaries (united in leading princi|ples, and differing only in a few indiffer|ent forms, or &s;peculative points) would keep their opinions to them&s;elves; their differences, as Calvin &s;eemed to think, might &s;erve the cau&s;e of religion, in&s;tead of injuring it. But the forwardne&s;s of teachers in impo&s;ing all their own whim|&s;ical dogmas on others, in&s;tead of keep|ing
<PB N="153" REF="169">to the great truths of religion, is the grand mi&s;chief. It is this, which di&s;|tracts the people; who being thus ac|cu&s;tomed to hear a different doctrine every day, begin to think of religion it|&s;elf, which appears &s;o variable an object, with le&s;s reverence.&mdash;Much of this in|temperate zeal had at this time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the teachers of religion; and it became very evident, that practical chri&s;tianity had loft ground; in proportion, as the &s;cience of theology was more &s;tudied.</P>
<P>To provide for the peace of the church, in oppo&s;ition to this growing evil, the council appointed the archbi&s;hop to draw up a &s;et of articles. The affair was deli|cate. The liberty of private judgment being the ba&s;is of the late &s;ece&s;&s;ion from the church of Rome, every re&s;traint upon it &s;eemed an oppo&s;ition to the leading principle of the reformation. A re&s;traint however on the clergy &s;eemed to be no breach of liberty. It was only what every church might ju&s;tly impo&s;e. No|thing more therefore was intended on this occa&s;ion, but to draw &s;uch a line, as would keep pa&s;tors within the pale of
<PB N="154" REF="170">their own congregations; or at lea&s;t prevent their di&s;turbing the e&s;tabli&s;hed church.</P>
<P>Among the various opinions, which di&s;tracted men at this time, be&s;ides the tenets of popery, which were yet far from being &s;ilenced, were tho&s;e concern|ing ju&s;tification, faith, good works, free will, and prede&s;tination.</P>
<P>The doctrine of &s;upererogation, and the &s;candalous &s;ale of indulgences, had brought good works into &s;uch di&s;credit, that many well di&s;po&s;ed teachers, with a view to oppo&s;e this evil the more effec|tually, laid the chief &s;tre&s;s on faith. The Antinomian pa&s;tors, refining on this, denied the benefit of any works at all. This again gave ju&s;t offence to others; who to rid them&s;elves of this mi&s;chief, ran into the other extreme; and not con|tent with &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity of good works, they inculcated their meritorious, and &s;ufficient efficacy.</P>
<P>Again, on the topics of free will, and prede&s;tination, the &s;ame variety of opi|nions di&s;tracted the people. Some teachers left the will at perfect liberty. Others
<PB N="155" REF="171">thought it more &s;criptural to allow it only free to &s;in; while good works, they conceived, proceeded merely from the grace of God. Others again, and in par|ticular a &s;ect &s;tiled the Go&s;pellers, would admit no qualifying at all in the doctrine of prede&s;tination; but re&s;olved all into the ab&s;olute decrees of God.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t this variety of doctrine, the archbi&s;hop endeavoured to draw up &s;uch a &s;et of articles, as would be&s;t provide for the peace of the church. It was a nice affair, and he thought it prudent on this occa&s;ion, as he had done before on a &s;imi|lar one, to u&s;e &s;uch moderation, perhaps &s;uch well-timed ambiguity, as might give as little offence as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Such was the origin of that celebrated te&s;t of orthodoxy, which is now known by the name of the 39 articles of the church of England. Tho&s;e framed by the archbi&s;hop indeed con&s;i&s;ted of 42: but in all &s;ucceeding &s;ettlements of the church, what was now compo&s;ed on this head, was not only made the groundwork; but was, in many parts, almo&s;t verbatim retained.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="172">In this work it is not known that the archbi&s;hop had any coadjutor. It is im|probable however that a man of his can|dour and mode&s;ty would engage in a work of this kind without many con&s;ultations with his friends: and it is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, that Ridley, bi&s;hop of London, was particularly u&s;eful to him. Ridley was a man of exemplary piety, and learn|ing; and what was &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary in the pre&s;ent work, a man of &s;ound judg|ment, and great moderation.</P>
<P>The chief objection, at this time of day, again&s;t the articles, &s;eems to be their treating at all of matters of &s;uch my&s;te|rious import. Let us endeavour, to &s;ettle, as we plea&s;e, the doctrines of fore|knowledge, prede&s;tination, and other points, equally ab&s;tru&s;e; we &s;hall find our&s;elves, at the clo&s;e of the argument, only where we began. As the&s;e deep que&s;tions however were the chief points debated at that time, the archbi&s;hop was under a nece&s;&s;ity of taking notice of them. At this day it is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary; and there|fore articles accommodated to the pre&s;ent times, would probably be formed on a
<PB N="157" REF="173">different plan. Few will think the arti|cles thus framed by archbi&s;hop Cranmer, in the infancy of the church, are compleat, and perfect: tho every candid per&s;on will &s;ee many difficulties, that would follow an attempt to make them more &s;o. If &s;uch an attempt could be &s;ucce&s;sfully pro&s;e|cuted, no doubt all good men would re|joice in it. In the mean time, they will admire the wi&s;dom, and moderation of that per&s;on, who framed them, as they are, in the mid&s;t of &s;o much prejudice, confu&s;ion, and contrariety of opinion.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t offen&s;ive articles, to &s;ub&s;cribers in general, is the 17th on <HI>pre|de&s;tination and election.</HI> But its title is its mo&s;t offen&s;ive part. It is certainly to be wi&s;hed, that &s;uch doctrines had been left untouched; as they &s;eem to be matters only of private opinion. But whatever were the archbi&s;hop's real &s;entiments on this &s;ubject, he &s;eems to have been very he&s;itating, and perhaps intentionally am|biguous, in the impo&s;ition of them on others. The &s;evere doctrine of reproba|tion &s;eems to be &s;trongly di&s;avowed under the pointed terms of <HI>a mo&s;t dangerous down|fall,
<PB N="158" REF="174">leading to de&s;peration, or unclean living.</HI> And how it is po&s;&s;ible to hold an ab&s;olute election, without mixing with it the doc|trine of reprobation, is not ea&s;y to con|ceive. Yet &s;till, as if the article, in the matter of election, had gone too far, it concludes with a&s;&s;erting, that <HI>we mu&s;t re|ceive God's promi&s;es, in &s;uch wi&s;e as they be generally &s;et forth in holy &s;cripture.</HI> So that, in fact, the article, fairly analyzed, &s;eems to a&s;&s;ert nothing, after all its cir|cumlocution, but that the doctrine of re|probation is very pernicious; and that as to God's election, and promi&s;es, whatever may be &s;aid about them, we mu&s;t re&s;olve all at la&s;t into a belief of what is generally &s;aid in &s;cripture.</P>
<P>But whatever imperfections the articles may really have; they have been charged with many, which they certainly have not. Of one very great in&s;tance of di&s;ingenuity I cannot forbear taking notice. It is con|tained in a celebrated writer on Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, who&s;e acrimony on all occa&s;ions, in which religion is concerned, I have al|ready remarked. After throwing out many
<PB N="159" REF="175">&s;evere things again&s;t the &s;pirit of the refor|mers at this time, and giving his reader an idea of the articles, which archbi&s;hop Cranmer now compo&s;ed. <Q>Care, &s;ays he, is taken to inculcate not only, that no heathen, however virtuous, can e&s;|cape an endle&s;s &s;tate of the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite mi&s;ery; but al&s;o, that any one who pre&s;umes to maintain, that a pagan can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aved, is him&s;elf expo&s;ed to the penalty of eternal perdition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume's hi&s;t. 4 to. Vol. III. p. 334. I&s;t. edition.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The article alluded to in this pa&s;&s;age, he tells us, is the 18th. Now the truth of the matter is, that this article has no|thing at all to do with the heathen world, either here, or hereafter. It does not in any &s;hape even hint at them. The early reformers mo&s;t probably &s;uppo&s;ed, as all charitable chri&s;tians do now, that the hea|then world were as much the objects of God's mercy, as chri&s;tians them&s;elves; and that Chri&s;t, who is called the <HI>lamb &s;lain, from the foundation of the world,</HI> died for their &s;ins, as well as ours: The article barely a&s;&s;erts, that no religion can promi&s;e
<PB N="160" REF="176">&s;alvation to mankind, except the chri&s;tian; which is &s;o far from damning pagans, that it virtually implies, Chri&s;t died for them, as well as for us.</P>

<P>Nor was this good prelate &s;o in|tirely ingro&s;&s;ed by his cares for the general welfare of the church, as not to pay a clo&s;e attention to the particular affairs of his own province. He made him&s;elf well acquainted with the characters of all the clergy in his di&s;trict. His vi&s;itations were not things of cour&s;e; but &s;trict &s;crutinies into the &s;tate of mini&s;ters, and their pa|ri&s;hes. In di&s;po&s;ing of his benefices, he endeavoured, as much as he could, to &s;uit the pa&s;tor to his flock. After his death was found, among his papers, a li&s;t of &s;eve|ral towns thus indor&s;ed: <HI>Memorandum; the&s;e towns to have learned mini&s;ters.</HI> In the&s;e places, it is probable, he knew the peo|ple were more than commonly addicted to
<PB N="161" REF="177">popery: or that they had gotten among them &s;ome popi&s;h prie&s;ts of more than or|dinary &s;ubtlety, who had mi&s;led them.</P>
<P>He was very exact al&s;o in the re&s;idence of the clergy; and granted di&s;pen&s;ations with caution. He had a &s;trict eye al&s;o on their doctrine. To &s;ome he recommended the homilies; and to others proper topics for their di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>He him&s;elf al&s;o preached often, where|ever he vi&s;ited. In his &s;ermons to the people he was very plain and in&s;tructive; in&s;i&s;ting chiefly on the e&s;&s;entials of chri&s;|tianity. In his &s;ermons at court, or on public occa&s;ions, he would declaim, with great freedom and &s;pirit, again&s;t the reigning vices of the times. His idea, however ju&s;t, &s;eems to have been, that the lower orders wanted principles more than practice; and the higher, practice more than principles.</P>
<P>Sir Richard Morri&s;on, a gentleman who had been much employed in emba&s;|&s;ies abroad, both under Henry the eighth and Edward the &s;ixth, gives us this cha|racter of the archbi&s;hop's &s;ermons, of which he was a frequent auditor. <Q>The
<PB N="162" REF="178">&s;ubjects of his &s;ermons, for the mo&s;t part, were, from whence &s;alvation is to be fetched; and on whom the confi|dence of man ought to lean. They in&s;i&s;ted much on doctrines of faith, and works; and taught what the fruits of faith were; and what place was to be given to works. They in&s;tructed men in the duties they owed their neigh|bour; and that every one was our neighbour, to whom we might any way do good. They declared, what men ought to think of them&s;elves, after they had done all; and la&s;tly, what promi&s;es Chri&s;t hath made; and who they are, to whom he will make them good. Thus he brought in the true preaching of the go&s;pel, altogether different from the ordinary way of preaching in tho&s;e days, which was to treat concerning &s;aints&mdash;to tell legendary tales of them&mdash;and to report miracles wrought for the confirmation of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation and other popi&s;h corruptions. And &s;uch a heat of conviction accompanied his &s;er|mons, that the people departed from them with minds po&s;&s;e&s;t of a great ha|tred
<PB N="163" REF="179">of vice; and burning with a de&s;ire of virtue.</Q></P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Burnet al&s;o, who had &s;een the greate&s;t part of a &s;ermon, which the arch|bi&s;hop had preached at court, on a fa&s;t day, in the year 1549, tells us, that <Q>it is a very plain, impartial di&s;cour&s;e; without any &s;hew of learning, or con|ceits of wit. He &s;everely expo&s;tulates, in the name of God, with his hearers for their ill lives, their bla&s;phemies, adulteries, mutual hatred, oppre&s;&s;ion, and contempt of the go&s;pel; and com|plains of the &s;lackne&s;s of government in puni&s;hing the&s;e &s;ins; by which it be|came, in &s;ome &s;ort, guilty of them.</Q>&mdash;From this account of the archbi&s;hop's preaching, it &s;eems, that whatever &s;pecu|lative opinions he might hold, no man could have a ju&s;ter idea of the great truths of the go&s;pel; nor of tho&s;e topics, on which its mini&s;ters ought chiefly to in&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Nor did his own dioce&s;e alone ingro&s;s his care. His advice was generally taken in filling up vacant fees in his province.
<PB N="164" REF="180">He lived, of cour&s;e, harmoniou&s;ly with all his bi&s;hops; and was &s;econded by them in all his &s;chemes of reformation. He recommended nothing more &s;eriou&s;ly to them, than to examine candidates for holy orders with the greate&s;t care; and to follow the apo&s;tle's advice in <HI>laying hands &s;uddenly on no man.</HI></P>
<P>It was common at that time, when any &s;ee became vacant, for every courtier to be on the watch to procure &s;ome rich grant out of its temporalities. The arch|bi&s;hop was as watchful on the other &s;ide; and when any &s;cheme of this kind was on foot, he was generally &s;ucce&s;sful in tra|ver&s;ing it.</P>
<P>He was commonly con&s;ulted al&s;o in the choice of Iri&s;h bi&s;hops. We have many of his recommendations &s;till extant. <Q>The foremo&s;t, (&s;ays he, on an occa&s;ion of this kind,) of tho&s;e, I propo&s;e, is Mr. Whitebread of Hadley, whom I take, for his good knowledge, &s;pecial hone&s;ty, fervent zeal, and polite wi&s;|dom, to be mo&s;t mete. Next to him Mr. Richard Turner, who be&s;ides that he is witty, and merry withal; (qua|lities
<PB N="165" REF="181">not unbecoming the gravity of a clergyman, if they be di&s;cretely u&s;ed) has nothing more at heart than Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and his religion; and in lively preaching of the word declareth &s;uch diligence, faithfulne&s;s, and wi&s;dom, as for the &s;ame de&s;erveth much com|mendation. There is al&s;o one Mr. Whitacre, a man both wi&s;e, and well learned, chaplain to the bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, very mete for that office; if he might be per&s;uaded to take it upon him.</Q></P>
<P>Nor did the good primate confine his cares even to tho&s;e of his own country: he extended them to the reformers of all nations, French, Dutch, Italians, and Spaniards, who had fled to England on account of religion. To him they all applied for that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which he rea|dily afforded.

<P>After a &s;ucce&s;sful admini&s;tration, the protector Somer&s;et, unhappily a&s;&s;um|ing too much con&s;equence, expo&s;ed him|&s;elf to an envious party, which had long been collecting again&s;t him. It was formed under the machinations of the Earl of Warwick, afterwards duke of Northumberland; a man totally unprin|cipled; guided only by his ambition; and equally ver&s;ed in the arts of attaching a party, and &s;upplanting a rival. All the protector's friends, one after another, he drew from him by &s;pecious pretences;
<PB N="167" REF="183">and when he made his fir&s;t grand move|ment in the &s;ece&s;&s;ion to Ely hou&s;e, he had the plea&s;ure to look round the a&s;&s;em|bly, and &s;ee, that &s;carce one man of con|&s;equence was ab&s;ent, except the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury.</P>
<P>Him no arts of &s;eduction could allure. He knew Northumberland's bad de&s;igns; and Somer&s;et's hone&s;t meanings. Each had ambition: but while that of Somer&s;et was gratified with a few trivial trappings, Northumberland's dark &s;chemes threat|ened ruin to the empire.</P>
<P>Nor was the primate merely neutral in this affair. He wrote to the &s;editious chiefs at Ely-hou&s;e with &s;uch a &s;pirit, as &s;hook their re&s;olutions; and would have broken the confederacy, had it been headed by a le&s;s daring leader, than the duke of Northumberland. It appears from the primate's letter, that he was more intimately acquainted with tho&s;e &s;ecret &s;prings, which governed their motions, than they could have wi&s;hed, or &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But altho the primate's remon&s;trance probably checked Northumberland's de|&s;igns,
<PB N="168" REF="184">as his fir&s;t manoeuvres &s;eem evi|dently marked with irre&s;olution; yet he gave way only to attack with greater vigour: and, in the end, Somer&s;et, tho allied to the crown, &s;hrouded by the affection of his prince, the favour of the people, and his own innocence, was unable to grapple with the pernicious arts of this &s;ubtle rival; and was brought to the &s;caffold for the foibles, and inac|curacies of his life, which were magnified into crimes.</P>
<P>After the duke of Somer&s;et's death, the archbi&s;hop had no weight in public af|fairs. Northumberland was as little the patron of religion, as he had hither|to been of public peace; and tho he found it convenient to make prote&s;tanti&s;m his profe&s;&s;ion; yet all men knew, that, neither it, nor any &s;pecies of religion, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop and he were never on terms. Often would Cecil &s;ay, <Q>Your grace mu&s;t temporize with this man, or we &s;hall do nothing.</Q> As often
<PB N="169" REF="185">would the primate an&s;wer, <Q>He would endeavour to do his utmo&s;t.</Q> But the integrity of his heart generally faltered in the attempt.</P>
<P>It was a difficult matter indeed, to keep terms with Northumberland. The arch|bi&s;hop had every rea&s;on to think him as much his own private enemy, as the enemy of the public. The ears of the young king were continually be&s;et with the duke's in&s;inuations: and tho Edward was not forward in li&s;tening to any &s;tories again&s;t the primate; yet enough was &s;aid to weaken all the coun&s;els, and defeat all the plans, which he propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Among the many mortifications, which he met with from Northumberland, it went neare&s;t his heart to &s;ee the little care, that was taken in filling vacant fees, and other great benefices of the church. His own recommendations of proper per|&s;ons had little weight; and he was grieved to find all tho&s;e low intere&s;ts prevailing, which would of cour&s;e introduce great in|difference among the mini&s;ters of religion. It was the con&s;tant endeavour of Nor|thumberland to keep the king, as little as
<PB N="170" REF="186">po&s;&s;ible acquainted with bu&s;ine&s;s of every kind; and as much out of the way of tho&s;e, who were likely to give him infor|mation. Among all the old mini&s;ters, none but Cecil had acce&s;s to the cabinet&mdash;Cecil, who&s;e courtly arts carried him to the very limits of &s;incerity&mdash;perhaps ra|ther beyond them. With him the arch|bi&s;hop intru&s;ted a li&s;t of &s;uch per&s;ons, as he thought mo&s;t proper to &s;ucceed to any vacancy; and the wary mini&s;ter, by ob|&s;erving opportunities, obtained prefer|ment for many of them.</P>
<P>The la&s;t affair of a public nature, in which the archbi&s;hop was engaged, during this &s;hort reign, was the exclu&s;ion of the prince&s;s Mary, in favour of Lady Jane Grey. Friend as he was to the reforma|tion, he oppo&s;ed this violent mea&s;ure with all his might; and pleaded the oath he had taken in favour of the prince&s;s. The whole power of Northumberland had no weight with him. The king him&s;elf, who had been wrought into a thorough conviction of the utility of excluding his
<PB N="171" REF="187">&s;i&s;ter, a&s;&s;ailed him with every argument, that tenderne&s;s, and affection could &s;ug|ge&s;t. The primate's con&s;tancy at length gave way; and he con&s;ented to hear the matter explained by the judges of the realm. The judges of the realm with great learn|ing &s;hewed him, that his late oath could not lawfully bind him. The archbi&s;hop mode&s;tly profe&s;&s;ed his ignorance of law; and took a new one: while the friends of his memory wi&s;h they had any veil to throw over his conduct in this di&s;credita|ble affair; which became afterwards in|deed a &s;ource of the deepe&s;t affliction to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Northumberland's great plan was now matured. The king, who had thus far been an in&s;trument, became, from this time, an incumbrance; and was laid a&s;ide with as little ceremony, as if he had been an actor in a drama. Thus at lea&s;t run the &s;u&s;picions of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="188">The king's death was a very &s;incere affliction to the archbi&s;hop, not only as a public calamity; but as a private lo&s;s. The archbi&s;hop was his godfather, and loved him with a parent's affection; and tho his high &s;tation would not allow him to take any part in the prince's educa|tion, yet Cheke, and all his other tutors, thought them&s;elves in &s;ome degree ac|countable to the archbi&s;hop; and u&s;ed to acquaint him with the progre&s;s of their royal pupil. We have a letter from Dr. Cox &s;till pre&s;erved; in which he tells the archbi&s;hop, in the language of the times, <Q>that the prince di&s;covered great toward|ne&s;s, and all hone&s;t qualities: that he &s;hould be taken as a &s;ingular gift of God: that he read Cato, Vives, and E&s;op; and that he conned very plea|&s;antly.</Q></P>
<P>Era&s;mus's character of him is rather curious. Era&s;mus &s;eems to have known little more, than that he was a very mode&s;t boy. But as he was a king like|wi&s;e, the panegyri&s;t thought it proper to
<PB N="173" REF="189">cloath his &s;entiment (for he had but one) in great pomp, and variety of expre&s;&s;ion. <Q>Senex, juvenis convictu, factus &s;um melior, ac &s;obrietatem, temperantiam verecundiam, linguae moderationem, mode&s;tiam, pudicitiam, integritatem, quam juvenis a &s;ene di&s;cere debuerat, a juvene &s;enex didici.</Q></P>

<P>After the death of Edward, which happened in the &s;ummer of the year 1553, we find the archbi&s;hop engaged in all the irre&s;olute mea&s;ures, &s;ucceeding that pe|riod, till the &s;ettlement of Mary. With the commencement of her reign his troubles began.</P>
<P>When he ob&s;erved the turn, which affairs were likely to take, one of the fir&s;t things he did, was to order his &s;teward to pay every farthing that he owed; &s;aying,
<PB N="174" REF="190"><Q>In a &s;hort time perhaps we may not be able.</Q> When the accounts and receipts were brought to him, <Q>I thank God, &s;aid he, I am now mine own man; and with God's help am able to an&s;wer all the world, and all wordly adver&s;ities.</Q></P>
<P>He was fir&s;t a&s;&s;aulted, as is u&s;ual, by calumny, and invective. A thou&s;and &s;tories were propagated; which were founded commonly on &s;ome little known circum&s;tance, or occurrence; and half the &s;tory being true, gave a degree of credit to the other half, which was fal&s;e. Many of the&s;e reports he &s;uffered to die away unnoticed; leaving his life and actions to confute them. But one, which concerned the intere&s;ts of religion, he thought it proper to obviate in a public manner. The affair was this.</P>
<P>Ma&s;s, it &s;eems, had been &s;aid in the cathedral church of Canterbury by &s;ome zealous prie&s;t, immediately on the change of government; and the report ran, that it had been done by the archbi&s;hop's order: as indeed, before any thing was
<PB N="175" REF="191">legally altered, it could not well be &s;up|po&s;ed otherwi&s;e. Many people believed it, who were much hurt with it; and the primate was &s;urprized to find, with what malicious expedition a &s;tory, &s;o wholly oppo&s;ite to the character he had ever maintained, could circulate not only among his enemies, but among his friends.</P>
<P>He determined therefore to &s;top it; and immediately drew up, and publi&s;hed, a declaration, in which he expre&s;&s;ed his abhorrence of the ma&s;s as a &s;pecies of idolatry&mdash;and profe&s;&s;ed his intire appro|bation of all the changes, that had been made in the la&s;t reign. This paper was con&s;idered, by the advocates for reforma|tion, as an in&s;tance of true chri&s;tian for|titude, well becoming the fir&s;t prote&s;tant eccle&s;ia&s;tic. By worldly men, it was looked on as a piece of indi&s;crete, and intemperate zeal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>It was by his own indi&s;crete zeal, that he brought on him&s;elf the fir&s;t violence, and per&s;ecution.</Q>
<P>Humes's reign of Mary. Chap. I.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was however more than the temper of the government could bear. The arch|bi&s;hop
<PB N="176" REF="192">was called before the Star-chamber, &s;everely que&s;tioned, and thrown into the Tower. The objected crime was trea&s;on: but his late bold declaration had, at lea&s;t, precipitated the mea&s;ure. The parlia|ment made no difficulty in attainting him: and indeed his compliance in the affair of Lady Jane was a very ju&s;tifiable founda|tion for an attainder.</P>
<P>This was a mea&s;ure, which was little expected by the archbi&s;hop; and touched him nearer than any thing could have done. If he had &s;uffered for his doctrines, he might have had the comfort of a good con&s;cience; but to &s;uffer as an evil-doer, was a mortification he could not bear.</P>
<P>It was true, indeed, that the queen had pardoned many, who were more con|cerned in the late &s;ettlement of the crown in favour of Lady Jane, than he had been. Few indeed, who were at all obnoxious, could be le&s;s &s;o: and his &s;ervices to Mary, in the time of her father, which were fre|quent, and di&s;intere&s;ted, de&s;erved &s;urely a grateful remembrance. But his remon|&s;trances, tho couched in the humble&s;t, and mo&s;t penitent language, had for &s;ome
<PB N="177" REF="193">time, no effect. At length however he obtained his pardon; mo&s;t probably be|cau&s;e it was more agreeable to the genius of the government, that he &s;hould &s;uffer for here&s;y, than for trea&s;on. On the former pretence, he was &s;till confined.</P>
<P>He might however have avoided que&s;|tion either on one account, or the other; if he could have prevailed with him&s;elf to leave the kingdom; as many church-men had done. Even after his impri&s;onment, he might probably have found the means of an e&s;cape. Some indeed imagined, it was what his greate&s;t enemies de&s;ired, as the ea&s;ie&s;t means of getting the di&s;po&s;al of the fee of Canterbury. But, from the beginning, he never would think of flight; and all the per&s;ua&s;ions and tears of his friends were ineffectual. <Q>Had I been in any other &s;tation, (he would &s;ay) ex|cept this, in which Providence hath placed me, I &s;hould certainly have fled. I approve the flight of others. If we are per&s;ecuted in one city, we are au|thorized to fly to another. But I am the only per&s;on in the kingdom, who cannot do it with decency. I have had
<PB N="178" REF="194">the principal hand in all the changes of the la&s;t reign, and I cannot, without great impropriety, avoid appearing in their defence.</Q></P>
<P>The gloomy temper of the government, in the mean while, became wholly ap|parent. So much violence attended every proceeding, in which religion was con|cerned, that it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, no mea&s;ures either of charity, or of decency, would be ob&s;erved. The queen delighted in being called a virgin &s;ent from heaven to revenge the cau&s;e of God. Under &s;uch a title nothing but bigotry, &s;uper|&s;tition, and all their dire effects, could be expected.</P>
<P>How well Gardiner, who was her chief mini&s;ter, was qualified to correct the &s;ternne&s;s of her temper, may be con|ceived from an anecdote, &s;till pre&s;erved among the gro&s;s improprieties of tho&s;e times. His almoner going one day to the Fleet-pri&s;on, then full of prote&s;tants, with a ba&s;ket of bread from the bi&s;hop, forbad the keeper, at his peril, to give
<PB N="179" REF="195">one mor&s;el of it to any of the heretics: If you do, added he, <Q>my Lord will cer|tainly do you &s;ome &s;hrewd turn.</Q></P>
<P>Rigorous however as Mary was in the affairs of religion, in &s;tate matters &s;he was lenient enough. No blood was &s;hed, but of tho&s;e, who&s;e offences placed them clearly beyond mercy.</P>
<P>The duke of Northumberland was the fir&s;t victim; than whom no man ever &s;uffered more unlamented.</P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop had the &s;atisfaction to hear that his friend Sir Thomas Palmer, died in the prote&s;tant faith; tho he had been per&s;uaded, with other &s;tate-pri&s;oners, to hear ma&s;s.</P>
<P>Palmer was one of the be&s;t bred men of the age, in which he lived. To his ac|compli&s;hments, both natural and acquired, he had added the advantages of foreign travel; which was rare in tho&s;e days. His youth had been &s;pent with too much licence; and he had been greatly mi&s;led by the in&s;idious arts of Northumberland: but in other re&s;pects he was well e&s;teemed;
<PB N="180" REF="196">and in his latter life e&s;pecially &s;eems to have added the virtues of a chri&s;tian to the accompli&s;hments of a gentleman. <Q>I have learned more (&s;aid he, as he &s;tood on the &s;caffold) in a dark corner of the Tower, than in travelling round Eu|rope.</Q> Then walking up to the ax, &s;tained with the blood of Northumberland, who had ju&s;t &s;uffered, <Q>I thank God, &s;aid he, I am not afraid to die.</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XXII.</HEAD>
<P>While this &s;cene of blood was acting, the archbi&s;hop continued in the Tower, &s;till unmole&s;ted. The lenity of the government towards him, was matter of general &s;urprize; as the public com|monly &s;uppo&s;ed he would have been the fir&s;t victim. But many things remained yet to be adju&s;ted. The great point how|ever was to give a triumph to popery in a public di&s;putation.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="197">In the year 1553, a convocation met at St. Paul's, by the queen's order, to &s;ettle the doctrine of the real pre&s;ence by a fair, and candid di&s;qui&s;ition. We&s;ton, dean of We&s;tmin&s;ter, was cho&s;en prolocutor. A few articles were propo&s;ed for &s;ub|&s;cription: and the di&s;putation was ad|journed to Oxford; where it was in|tended, that the three bi&s;hops, Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, &s;hould enter the li&s;ts with a &s;elect body of popi&s;h di&s;|putants.</P>
<P>The&s;e fellow-&s;ufferers were all at that time, confined together in a &s;mall apart|ment in the Tower. Their &s;traitened accommodations however were amply made up to them by the comfort of each other's company. They carried their bibles with them; and on the&s;e they em|ployed their pri&s;on hours; fortifying their faith, and extracting topics of con&s;olation. The&s;e are the &s;cenes, in which we are to look for the triumphs of religion. Where its great principles are firmly rooted in the heart, human joys, and human griefs, and human fears, are trivial things.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="198">The convocation had been adjourned to the end of the year 1553: but the &s;e|veral members of it did not meet at Oxford, till the following April. There al&s;o, at the &s;ame time, the three bi&s;hops were carried by the lord Williams of Thame.</P>
<P>From their treatment, on this occa|&s;ion, it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, what mea|&s;ures, they were likely to expect. They had hitherto been confined, it is true, in a very narrow compa&s;s; but as the Tower was then crouded with pri&s;oners, better accommodations could not well be allow|ed. In other re&s;pects however they had received marks of attention. What they wanted, had been readily furni&s;hed; and their own &s;ervants were &s;uffered to attend them.</P>
<P>But as &s;oon as this new mea&s;ure took place, they experienced a different treat|ment. The little baggage they had, was &s;topped: their &s;ervants were di&s;charged: they were conducted to Oxford with ig|nominy;
<PB N="183" REF="199">and were thrown into the com|mon jail.</P>
<P>The time appointed for the grand di&s;|putation at length arrived. Delegates from both univer&s;ities joined the mem|bers of convocation; and the whole body, to the number of thirty-three, a&s;&s;embled at St. Mary's church. There being dre&s;&s;ed in their academical robes, they &s;eated them&s;elves in great &s;tate, around the high altar, and the archbi&s;hop was &s;ent for. He was brought into the church by the mayor, and bailiffs, under the guard of a company of billmen. They who had known him in his better days, &s;aw him now greatly changed. In&s;tead of that glow of health upon his cheek; that bri&s;k, and active &s;tep, which &s;hewed the vigour of his con&s;titution; he was now become, through ill-u&s;age, and confinement, a pale, infeebled old man. Clad in a plain habit, with a &s;taff in his hand; he came forward through an open|ing in the croud, paying the prolocutor,
<PB N="184" REF="200">and his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, great re&s;pect. They offered him a &s;eat: but he declined it.</P>
<P>The prolocutor then addre&s;&s;ed him, on the happine&s;s of religious unity; and told him, the intention of the pre&s;ent meeting was to draw him if po&s;&s;ible, again to the church. <Q>The&s;e articles, (&s;aid he, hold|ing out a paper), were agreed on by con|vocation, which, we hope, you will have no objection to &s;ub&s;cribe.</Q></P>
<P>The archbi&s;hop, receiving the paper, joined the prolocutor in a mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h for chri&s;tian unity; when it could be obtained, he &s;aid, with a good con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Having read the articles, which con|tained the doctrine of the real pre&s;ence, drawn up, according to the determination of the church of Rome; he &s;hook his head, and &s;aid, he feared that paper would not afford a &s;ufficient foundation for the religious unity, which all &s;o much de&s;ired. He offered however, if the paper were left in his hands, to give a fuller an&s;wer to it by the next morning. This was permitted. At the &s;ame time, it was agreed, that each point of differ|ence
<PB N="185" REF="201">&s;hould afterwards be the &s;ubject of a regular di&s;putation.</P>
<P>On the next day, which was Sunday, the archbi&s;hop declared in writing, his &s;en&s;e of the articles; and the Monday following was appointed to di&s;cu&s;s the que&s;tions, on which the two parties dif|fered.</P>
<P>I mean not however here to enter into a detail of this di&s;putation; which was car|ried into great length; and at this day would be tedious, unintere&s;ting, and un|in&s;tructive, Neither archbi&s;hop Cran|mer, nor bi&s;hop Ridley, I think, acted with &s;o much propriety on this occa&s;ion, as bi&s;hop Latimer. The papi&s;ts, it &s;eems, pu&s;hed them with the authority of the fathers; &s;ome of whom talk of the &s;acra|ment of the Lord's &s;upper in a language, to &s;peak &s;lightly of it, uncommonly figu|rative. Cranmer and Ridley not caring to deny &s;o re&s;pectable an authority, &s;eem to have been at a lo&s;s how to evade it: while Latimer with more chri&s;tian &s;implicity, rid him&s;elf of the difficulty at once; <Q>I
<PB N="186" REF="202">lay no &s;tre&s;s on the fathers, &s;aid he, ex|cept when they lay a &s;tre&s;s on &s;cripture.</Q></P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the di&s;putation the arch|bi&s;hop complained greatly of the &s;hortne&s;s of the time allowed for di&s;cu&s;&s;ing a &s;ub|ject of &s;uch importance: and wi&s;hed al&s;o, that he might be allowed to oppo&s;e, as well as to an&s;wer; which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, he &s;aid, in a fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a que&s;tion. But he was not heard on either of the&s;e points: from which, he ob&s;erved, it evidently appeared, that nothing le&s;s was intended, than a fair in|ve&s;tigation of truth.</P>
<P>But in whatever light the arguments of the&s;e prote&s;tant bi&s;hops may appear at this day, their chri&s;tian fortitude will ever be admired. In their own times it was thought matter of great rejoicing, and chri&s;tian triumph. Soon after the di&s;pu|tation was over, the three bi&s;hops receiv|ed the following &s;pirited letter from Dr. Taylor, in the name of all their &s;uffering brethren.</P>

<P>On the 20th of April 1554, the arch|bi&s;hop was condemned. From that time, a more rigorous treatment, than he had yet experienced, took place. It is &s;aid, he was &s;carce allowed the nece&s;&s;aries of life; tho it is probable &s;uch accounts may be exaggerated.

<P>By this parliament the pope's legate was invited into England: and on his ar|rival, the nation was reconciled in form to the holy &s;ee; the legate ab&s;olving all the perjuries, &s;ci&s;ms, and here&s;ies, of which the parliament, and the convocation had been guilty.</P>
<P>After this, religious affairs were modelled.

<P>Among other in&s;tances of popi&s;h zeal, the archbi&s;hop was informed, that his book on the &s;acrament had been publicly burnt. <Q>Ah! &s;aid he, they have ho|noured it more than it de&s;erved: I hear

<P>While the prote&s;tant &s;ufferers were lingering in various pri&s;ons, a very un&s;ea|&s;onable di&s;pute got footing among &s;ome of the warme&s;t of them, on the arduous &s;ubject of free-will, and prede&s;tination. It was carried on with &s;uch animo&s;ity, that confe&s;&s;ions were drawn up on both &s;ides; and &s;igned by numbers, who were at that time even under &s;entence of death. Each party clamoured loud, that their antagoni&s;ts were likely to do more harm in the chri&s;tian world, than the papi&s;ts them&s;elves; in as much as their opinions were as bad, and their example much better. Nay to &s;uch a height of phrenzy did their contentions run, that the keeper of the Mar&s;hal&s;ea was often obliged to &s;eparate them.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of this ill-timed controver&s;y, the archbi&s;hop was applied to, for his countenance, by the prede&s;ti|narians,
<PB N="192" REF="208">to who&s;e tenets he was thought mo&s;t inclined. But the prudent primate di&s;countenanced both parties, as much as he could; con&s;idering, no doubt, &s;uch controver&s;ies to be e&s;pecially ill-judged among dying men.</P>
<P>Nor were the endeavours of others wanting to calm the rage of this offen&s;ive zeal. Many of their more moderate bre|thren endeavoured to &s;et before them the impropriety of their behaviour: and one of them put the matter in a very &s;trong light: <Q>There &s;hould be no more bitter|ne&s;s, &s;aid he, in a chri&s;tian contro|ver&s;y, than in a love letter.</Q> Philpot, afterwards an eminent martyr, wrote a very pathetic di&s;&s;ua&s;ive to them on this &s;ubject; exhorting them <Q>to meet each other with the ki&s;s of charity&mdash;to reach out chearfully the hand of peace&mdash;to take up their cro&s;s together, and a&s;cend mount Calvary with hearts full of be|nevolence.</Q></P>
<P>I give a detail of this &s;trange di&s;pute, both as a curious anecdote of human na|ture, and as a very in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on. If a &s;peculative opinion could fa&s;ten with &s;o
<PB N="193" REF="209">much violence, and produce &s;o much animo&s;ity, in the minds of pious men, &s;uffering together in one common cau&s;e, and even in the article, as it were, of death&mdash;how cautious ought they to be on polemical &s;ubjects, who have perhaps le&s;s piety, who live at their ea&s;e, and are not tied by any of the&s;e &s;trong obligations to forbearance.</P>
<P>While the Engli&s;h prote&s;tants were thus &s;uffering at home, &s;uch of them as had the good fortune to e&s;cape abroad, enjoyed more repo&s;e. Among the Lu|therans indeed they met with &s;ome unkind treatment. Their liberal tenets, with regard to the Lord's &s;upper, were very di&s;gu&s;ting to tho&s;e reformers, who &s;till maintained the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion. The leaders however of the Lu|theran churches, particularly Melancthon, who was a man of candour and modera|tion, brought their hearers to a better temper; and in&s;tructed the populace at We&s;el, and Francford, where this inho&s;|pitable di&s;po&s;ition chiefly appeared, that
<PB N="194" REF="210">altho the Engli&s;h exiles might differ from them in a few points; they were however embarked with them in the &s;ame common cau&s;e of religious liberty; and ought cer|tainly to be treated as brethren.</P>
<P>At Ba&s;il, John Fox de&s;igned, and al|mo&s;t fini&s;hed his <HI>Acts and monuments of the church.</HI> The indu&s;try of this man is a&s;toni&s;hing. He was principal corrector to one of the greate&s;t printing hou&s;es in Europe; that of Operin at Ba&s;il. But notwith&s;tanding his daily employment, he found lei&s;ure to carry on this va&s;t work: and what is &s;till more, tho he was not able to keep a &s;ervant to do his menial offices, the whole was tran&s;cribed with his own hand. From a work of this kind, we are not led to expect any elegance: yet they who have examined this writer with mo&s;t accuracy, have ac|knowledged, that altho his zeal may have led him into &s;ome exaggerated accounts, where he relies only on hear&s;ay; yet in all matters, where he appeals to authority, or record, he may be fully depended on.</P>
<P>At Stra&s;burgh, bi&s;hop Jewel laid the plan of his excellent <HI>Apology for the church
<PB N="195" REF="211">of England;</HI> tho he did not fini&s;h it till happier times&mdash;a work, in which its many admirers found it hard to &s;ay, whether candour, and humanity; or &s;en&s;e, learning, and a well-tempered zeal for religion, were more con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>Here too William Turner, phy&s;ician to the protector Somer&s;et, pubi&s;hed a work, intitled, <HI>A di&s;pen&s;atory of &s;piritual phy&s;ic.</HI> It was levelled again&s;t the papi&s;ts; and was written with a &s;arca&s;tic vein of hu|mour; Such &s;allies of wit and ridicule, tho rather below the dignity of &s;uffering religion, &s;erved however to divert the univer&s;al melancholy, which reigned at that time. Turner publi&s;hed al&s;o another work of the &s;ame kind, which he called, <HI>The hunting of the Romi&s;h fox.</HI></P>
<P>The celebrated Scotch reformer, John Knox, publi&s;hed al&s;o, at this time, an exhortation to the people of England, &s;uited to their calamitous &s;tate. It abounds more with enthu&s;ia&s;m, than manly &s;en&s;e. Knox had thus early put in his preten&s;ions to a prophetic &s;pirit, which flowed afterwards in more plentiful effu&s;ions from him.</P>

<P>A full year had now elap&s;ed, &s;ince the archbi&s;hop's di&s;putation at Oxford, and condemnation for here&s;y. During this interval the Spirit of per&s;ecution, with a fiery &s;word in one hand, and a cro&s;s in the other, was let loo&s;e in all its terrors. The progre&s;s however of this violent reign marks only the Almigh|ty's ordinary mode of providence. When the chri&s;tian religion was fir&s;t preached, the malice of its enemies immediately aro&s;e, as if to try, and prove it; and &s;eal its truth by the blood of its martyrs. And now when religion was re&s;tored, after &s;o long an age of darkne&s;s, the pro|vidence of God &s;eemed to direct in the &s;ame manner that it &s;hould be purified and proved by per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Among the numbers, at this time, who died for their religion, were the bi&s;hops of London and Worce&s;ter; who
<PB N="197" REF="213">were delivered over to the &s;ecular arm under a commi&s;&s;ion from Pole the cardi|nal-legate.</P>
<P>As they were carried to the &s;take, they pa&s;&s;ed under the window of the pri&s;on, in which the archbi&s;hop was confined; and looked up for a parting view. The archbi&s;hop was engaged at that time, in a conference with a Spani&s;h friar; but hearing a tumult in the &s;treet, he came to the window. They were not yet out of &s;ight. He ju&s;t lifted up his eyes and hands, and &s;ent after the venerable &s;uf|ferers, a fervent ejaculation for God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this la&s;t great trial.</P>
<P>More ceremony however was thought nece&s;&s;ary in the primate's ca&s;e, than had been u&s;ed in theirs. Pole's authority was not &s;ufficient. A commi&s;&s;ion there|fore was &s;ent for to Rome.</P>
<P>In virtue of this commi&s;&s;ion, the arch|bi&s;hop was convened before the bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, to whom it was delegated, on the 12th of September, 1555. His books, and opinions; his marriage, and
<PB N="198" REF="214">inva&s;ion of the privileges of the &s;ove|reign pontiff, were all &s;ummarily recapi|tulated; and he was cited to appear at Rome in eighty days, and an&s;wer for him&s;elf. As he did not appear in that time, he was declared contumacious; and a commi&s;&s;ion was di&s;patched to Eng|land, to degrade, and deliver him over to the &s;ecular arm.</P>
<P>Many of our hi&s;torians exclaim loudly at the ab&s;urdity of declaring him con|tumacious for not appearing at Rome; when it was well known, that, during the whole time, he was detained a pri&s;oner at Oxford. And, no doubt, the thing bears the face of ab&s;urdity. But it would be endle&s;s to cen&s;ure, and deride, all the formalities of law, which are pertinaci|ou&s;ly retained in every country, after the real u&s;e hath expired.</P>
<P>The ceremony of his degradation was performed by Thirlby bi&s;hop of Ely.</P>
<P>Thirlby, in Cranmer's better days, had been honoured with his particular friend&s;hip, and owed him many obliga|tions. Be&s;ides tho&s;e of greater value, in the way of preferment, <Q>there was no|thing
<PB N="199" REF="215">he was ma&s;ter of, (we are infor|med) which was not at Thirlby's com|mand. Jewel, plate, in&s;trument, map, hor&s;e, or any thing el&s;e, tho a pre&s;ent from the king, if his friend once took a fancy to it, the generous archbi&s;hop would immediately give it him. And tho many times the doctor for civility's &s;ake would in&s;tantly refu&s;e it; yet Cranmer would &s;end it him the next day by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;age. In&s;omuch that it grew into a proverb, that Dr. Thirlby's commendation of any thing to my lord of Canterbury, was a plain winning or obtaining it.</Q></P>
<P>As this man therefore had long been &s;o much attached to the archbi&s;hop, it was thought proper by his new friends, that he &s;hould give an extraordinary te&s;t of his zeal. For this rea&s;on the ceremony of the degradation was committed to him. He had undertaken however too hard a ta&s;k. The mild benevolence of the pri|mate, which &s;hone forth with great dig|nity, tho he &s;tood dre&s;t in all the mock pageantry of canvas robes, &s;truck the old apo&s;tate to the heart. All the pa&s;t came
<PB N="200" REF="216">throbbing into his brea&s;t; and a few repentant drops began to trickle down the furrows of his aged cheek. The arch|bi&s;hop gently exhorted him not to &s;uffer his private affections to overpower his public. At length, one by one, the canvas trappings were taken off, amid&s;t the taunts, and exultations of Bonner, bi&s;hop of London, who was pre&s;ent at the ceremony. The archbi&s;hop made &s;ome he&s;itation when they took his cro|zier out of his hands; and appealed as others had done, to the next general council.</P>
<P>Thus degraded, he was attired in a plain frieze-gown, the common habit of a yeoman at that time; and had, what was then called, a <HI>town's-man's cap,</HI> put upon his head. In this garb, he was carried back to pri&s;on; Bonner crying after him, <Q>He is now no longer my lord! &mdash;He is now no longer my lord!</Q></P>
<P>Full of that indignation, which public wrongs, not private, in&s;pired, he wrote a letter from his pri&s;on to the queen; in
<PB N="201" REF="217">which he expo&s;tulated with her for &s;ink|ing the dignity of the crown of England to &s;uch a degree, as to have recour&s;e to foreigners for ju&s;tice on her own &s;ubjects. He &s;hewed her, with great force of rea|&s;on, the many inconveniences, which aro&s;e from thus &s;ubmitting to a foreign yoke; and opened the de&s;igns of the clergy, who had introduced, he told her, this &s;lavery again, with the &s;ole view of e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves in their ancient independent &s;tate. He put her in mind al&s;o of the oath &s;he had taken to her own kingdom; and of the oath which &s;he had taken to the pope; and begged her to con&s;ider, whether there was not &s;ome contradiction between them.&mdash;He con|cluded with telling her, that he thought it his duty to enter his prote&s;t again&s;t the de&s;tructive mea&s;ures, which her govern|ment was then pur&s;uing.</P>
<P>This letter was carried to the queen by the bailiffs of Oxford. She immediately put it into the hands of cardinal Pole; with whom &s;he &s;eems, on all occa&s;ions, to have left the di&s;po&s;al of her con&s;cience. Pole in a letter, dated from St. James's,
<PB N="202" REF="218">Nov. 6, 1555, an&s;wered it at full length. His very elaborate di&s;cour&s;e on this occa|&s;ion makes the 89th article of Mr. Strype's appendix.</P>
<P>From the time of Cranmer's degrada|tion, the behaviour of the popi&s;h party towards him, was totally changed. Every one, who now approached him, put on an air of civility, and re&s;pect. Elegant entertainments were made for him. He was invited frequently by the dean of Chri&s;t-church to parties at bowls; an exerci&s;e, of which he had always been fond: and no liberty, or indulgence, which he could de&s;ire, was denied. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e amu&s;ements, he was given to under&s;tand, that the queen was greatly di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ave him: but that &s;he had often been heard to &s;ay, &s;he would either have Cranmer a catholic, or no Cranmer at all&mdash;that, in &s;hort, they were authorized in a&s;&s;uring him, that if he would only conform to the pre&s;ent changes in religion, he might, if he plea&s;ed, a&s;&s;ume his former dignity&mdash;or,
<PB N="203" REF="219">if he declined that, he might enjoy a liberal pen&s;ion in retirement.</P>
<P>Among all the in&s;tances of diabolical cruelty we &s;carce find a greater than this. The whole rage of the popi&s;h party &s;eemed to be centered again&s;t this upright man. His &s;oul they had damned: his body they were determined to burn; and to com|pleat their triumph, they wanted only to bla&s;t his reputation. With this view, the&s;e wicked arts were put in practice again&s;t him; which &s;ucceeded, alas! too well. Cranmer, who was &s;ufficiently armed again&s;t the utmo&s;t rage and malice of his open enemies, was drawn a&s;ide by the delu&s;ions of his fal&s;e friends. After the confinement of a full year within the melancholy walls of a gloomy pri&s;on, this &s;udden return into &s;ocial commerce di&s;&s;ipated the firm re&s;olves of his &s;oul. A love of life, which he had now well ma&s;tered, began in&s;en&s;ibly to grow upon him. A paper was offered him, import|ing his a&s;&s;ent to the tenets of popery; and in an evil hour his better re&s;olutions giving way, he &s;igned the fatal &s;nare.</P>

<P>Cranmer's recantation was received by the popi&s;h party with joy beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion. It was immediately printed and publi&s;hed; and their cruel work wanting now only its la&s;t fini&s;hing &s;troke, a war|rant was expedited for his execution, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible: while he him&s;elf was yet kept ignorant of their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Some writers &s;ay, that the recantation was publi&s;hed unfairly; and a modern attempt has been made to invalidate that re|cantation, which the papi&s;ts &s;ent abroad<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Whi&s;ton's enquiry into the evidence of arch|bi&s;hop Cranmer's recantation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But even on a &s;uppo&s;ition this had been the ca&s;e, as, in &s;ome degree, it probably might, yet a very poor defence can be e&s;tabli&s;hed, on this ground. Cranmer certainly &s;ub&s;cribed his a&s;&s;ent to the tenets of popery in general terms: and unle&s;s the zeal of his friends could rid his memory of that &s;tain, it is of little con|&s;equence
<PB N="205" REF="221">to &s;ay, he did not &s;ub&s;cribe them in the detail. A much better apology may be grounded on the weak|ne&s;s of human nature. They, who look into them&s;elves, mu&s;t pity him; and wi&s;h to throw over him the &s;kirts of that tender veil, with which the great Friend of mankind once &s;kreened the infirmities of the well-intentioned: <HI>the &s;pirit was willing, but the fle&s;h was weak.</HI></P>
<P>But no apology could vindicate him to him&s;elf. In his own judgment, he was fully convicted. In&s;tead of that joy, which gives &s;erenity to the dying martyr; his brea&s;t was a devoted prey to contri|tion and woe. A re&s;cued life afforded him no comfort. He had never till now felt the power of his enemies. Stung with remor&s;e and horror at what he had done, he con&s;umed his days, and nights in angui&s;h. <Q><HI>I have denied the faith: I have pierced my&s;elf through with many &s;arrows;</HI></Q> were the melancholy notes, which took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind; and rang in his ears a con&s;tant alarm. Then would recur, in a full tide of compunc|tion, the aggravating thoughts&mdash;that he,
<PB N="206" REF="222">who had been chiefly in&s;trumental in bringing in the true faith, &s;hould be among tho&s;e, who had de&s;erted it&mdash;that he, who had been &s;o long the leader of others, &s;hould now &s;et them &s;o dreadful an example&mdash;and that he, who had always been looked up to with re&s;pect, &s;hould at length be lo&s;t, and abandoned among the herd of apo&s;tates!</P>
<P>Overwhelmed with grief; and per|plexity, whichever way he turned his eyes, he &s;aw no ray of comfort left. To per&s;evere in his recantation, was an in|&s;upportable thought: to retract it, was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible. His paper was abroad in the world; and he him&s;elf was in the hands of men, who could ea&s;ily prevent his publi&s;hing, or &s;peaking, any thing counter to it; if they &s;hould &s;u&s;pect he had &s;uch an intention.</P>
<P>He had yet received no intimation of his death; tho it was now the 20th of March; and by the purport of the war|rant, he was to be executed the next day.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="223">That evening Dr. Cole, one of the heads of the popi&s;h party, came to him; and from the in&s;idious, and ambiguous di&s;cour&s;e of this per&s;on, he had the fir&s;t intimation, tho yet no direct one, of what his enemies intended.</P>
<P>After Cole had left him, he &s;pent the re|maining part of the evening in drawing up a repentant &s;peech, together with a full confe&s;&s;ion of his apo&s;tacy; re&s;olving to take the be&s;t opportunity to &s;peak or publi&s;h it; which he &s;uppo&s;ed indeed the &s;take would fir&s;t give him. But, beyond his expectation, a better was afforded.</P>
<P>It was intended, that he &s;hould be carried immediately from pri&s;on to the &s;take; where a &s;ermon was to be preached. But the morning of the appointed day being wet, and &s;tormy, the ceremony was performed under cover.</P>
<P>About nine o'clock the lord Williams of Thame, attended by the magi&s;trates of Oxford, received him at the pri&s;on-gate; and conveyed him to St. Mary's church; where he found a crouded audience wait|ing
<PB N="208" REF="224">for him.&mdash;He was conducted to an elevated place, in public view, oppo&s;ite to the pulpit.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce time to reflect a moment on the dreadful &s;cene, which he &s;aw pre|paring for him, when the vice-chancellor, and heads of hou&s;es, with a numerous train of doctors, and profe&s;&s;ors, entered the church. Among them was Dr. Cole, who paying his re&s;pects to the vice-chan|cellor, a&s;cended the pulpit.</P>
<P>Cole was a man of abilities; and was con&s;idered, according to the mode of tho&s;e times, as an elegant &s;cholar. His di&s;cour&s;e indeed &s;eems to have been an excellent piece of oratory.</P>
<P>After a proper preface, he &s;hewed the rea&s;ons, why it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to put the unhappy per&s;on before them to death, notwith&s;tanding his recantation. On this head he dwelt largely, and &s;aid full as much, as &s;o bad a cau&s;e could be &s;uppo&s;ed to bear. Then turning to his audience, he very pathetically exhorted them to fear God, and tremble; taking occa&s;ion from the example before their eyes, to remind them of the in&s;tability of
<PB N="209" REF="225">all human things; and of the great duty of <HI>holding fa&s;t their profe&s;&s;ion without wavering.</HI> This venerable man, &s;aid he, once a peer, a privy-coun&s;ellor, an archbi&s;hop, and the &s;econd per&s;on in the realm, renounced his faith, and is now fallen below the lowe&s;t.</P>
<P>He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf la&s;t to the degraded primate him&s;elf. He condoled with him in his pre&s;ent calamitous circum&s;tances; and exhorted him to &s;upport with forti|tude his la&s;t worldly trial.</P>
<P>Cranmer's behaviour, during this di&s;|cour&s;e, cannot be better de&s;cribed, than in the words of a per&s;on pre&s;ent; who, tho a papi&s;t, &s;eems to have been a very impartial &s;pectator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The letter, from which mo&s;t of the following ac|count is taken, was found among Fox's MSS. and is taken notice of by Strype.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>It is doleful, &s;ays he, to de&s;cribe his behaviour; his &s;orrowful countenance; his heavy cheer; his face bedewed with tears; &s;ometimes lifting up his eyes to heaven in hope; &s;ometimes ca&s;ting them down to the earth for &s;hame. To be brief, he was an image of &s;or|row. The dolor of his heart bur&s;t out
<PB N="210" REF="226">continually at his eyes in gu&s;hes of tears: yet he retained ever a quiet, and grave behaviour; which increa&s;ed the pity in men's hearts, who unfeignedly loved him, hoping it had been his re|pentance for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>The preacher having concluded his &s;ermon, turned round to the whole au|dience; and, with an air of great dignity, de&s;ired all, who were pre&s;ent, to join with him in &s;ilent prayers for the un|happy man before them.</P>
<P>A &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s en&s;ued. Every eye, and every hand were in&s;tantly lifted up to heaven.</P>
<P>Some minutes having been &s;pent in this affecting manner, the degraded pri|mate, who had fallen al&s;o on his knees, aro&s;e in all the dignity of &s;orrow; and thus addre&s;&s;ed his audience.</P>
<P><Q>I had my&s;elf intended to have de&s;ired your prayers. My de&s;ires have been anticipated; and I return you, all that a dying man can give, my &s;incere&s;t thanks.&mdash;To your prayers for me, let me add my own.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="227">He then, with great fervour of devo|tion, broke out into this pathetic excla|mation.</P>

<P><PB N="212" REF="228">While he thus prayed, the people &s;pontaneou&s;ly caught the fervour; and joined audibly with him. The whole &s;cene was highly &s;olemn, and affecting.</P>
<P>Having concluded his prayer, he ro&s;e from his knees; and taking a paper from his bo&s;om, continued his &s;peech to this effect.</P>
<P><Q>It is now, my brethren, no time to di&s;&s;emble. I &s;tand upon the verge of life&mdash;a va&s;t eternity is before me.&mdash;What my fears are, or what my hopes, it matters not here to unfold. For one action of my life at lea&s;t I am account|able to the world&mdash;my late &s;hameful &s;ub&s;cription to opinions, which are wholly oppo&s;ite to my real &s;entiments. Before this congregation I &s;olemnly declare, that the fear of death alone induced me to this ignominious action&mdash;that it hath co&s;t me many bitter tears&mdash;that in my heart I totally reject the pope, and doctrines of the church of Rome&mdash;and that</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>As he was continuing his &s;peech, the whole a&s;&s;embly was in an uproar. Lord Williams gave the fir&s;t impul&s;e to the
<PB N="213" REF="229">tumult; crying aloud, <Q>Stop the auda|cious heretic.</Q> On which &s;everal prie&s;ts and friars, ru&s;hing from different parts of the church, with great eagerne&s;s &s;eized him; pulled him from his &s;eat; dragged him into the &s;treet; and with much indecent precipitation, hurried him to the &s;take, which was already prepared, Executioners were on the &s;pot, who &s;ecuring him with a chain, piled the faggots in order round him.</P>
<P>As he &s;tood thus, with all the horrid apparatus of death about him, amid&s;t taunts, revilings, and execrations, he alone maintained a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate behaviour. Having now di&s;charged his con&s;cience, his mind grew lighter; and he &s;eemed to feel, even in the&s;e circum&s;tances, an in|ward &s;atisfaction, to which he had long been a &s;tranger: His countenance was not fixed, as before, in abject: &s;orrow, on the ground; he looked round him with eyes full of &s;weetne&s;s, and benignity, as if at peace with all the world.</P>
<P>A torch being put to the pile, he was pre&s;ently involved in a bur&s;t of &s;moke, and crackling flame: but on the &s;ide next
<PB N="214" REF="230">the wind, he was di&s;tinctly &s;een, before the fire reached him, to thru&s;t his right hand into it, and to hold it there with a&s;toni&s;hing firmne&s;s; crying out, "This hand hath offended! This hand hath offended!"&mdash;When we &s;ee human nature &s;truggling &s;o nobly with &s;uch uncommon &s;ufferings, it is a plea&s;ing reflection, that, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, there is a firmne&s;s in the mind of man, which will &s;upport him under trials, in appear|ance beyond his &s;trength.</P>
<P>His &s;ufferings were &s;oon over. The fire ri&s;ing inten&s;ely around him, and a thick &s;moke involving him, it was &s;up|po&s;ed, he was pre&s;ently dead. <Q>His patience in his torment, (&s;ays the au|thor of the letter I have ju&s;t quoted) and his courage in dying, if it had been in te&s;timony of the truth, as it was of falshood, I &s;hould worthily, have com|mended; and have matched it with the &s;ame of any father of ancient time. Surely his death grieved every one. Some pitied his body tormented by the fire; others pitied his &s;oul, lo&s;t with|out redemption for ever. His friends
<PB N="215" REF="231">&s;orrowed for love; his enemies for pity; and &s;trangers through humanity.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;tory of his heart's remaining un|con&s;umed in the mid&s;t of the fire, &s;eems to be an in&s;tance of that credulous zeal, which we have often &s;een lighted at the flames of dying martyrs.</P>

<P>Such was the end of Thomas Cranmer, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in the 67th year of his age, after he had pre&s;ided over the church of England above twenty years.</P>
<P>In whatever point of light we view this extraordinary man, he is equally the object of our admiration.</P>
<P>His indu&s;try, and attention were a&s;|toni&s;hing. When we con&s;ider him as a &s;cholar, his learning was &s;o profound; and the treati&s;es, which he wrote, were &s;o numerous, that we cannot conceive he had any time for bu&s;ine&s;s. And yet when
<PB N="216" REF="232">we consider the various &s;cenes of active life, in which he was engaged&mdash;in the council&mdash;in the convocation&mdash;in the par|liament&mdash;in his dioce&s;e&mdash;and even in his own hou&s;e, where he had a con&s;tant re|&s;ort of learned men, or &s;uitors; we are &s;urprized how he procured time for &s;tudy.</P>
<P>He never indeed could have gone through his daily employments, had he not been the be&s;t oeconomi&s;t of his time.</P>
<P>He ro&s;e commonly at five o'clock; and continued in his &s;tudy till nine: The&s;e early hours, he would &s;ay, were the only hours he could call his own. After breakfa&s;t he generally &s;pent the remainder of the morning either in public, or pri|vate bu&s;ine&s;s. His chapel-hour was eleven; and his dinner-hour twelve. After dinner he &s;pent an hour either in conver&s;ation with his friends; in playing at che&s;s; or in, what he liked better, overlooking a che&s;s-board. He then re|tired again to his &s;tudy, till his chapel|bell rang at five. After prayers, he ge|nerally walked till &s;ix, which was, in tho&s;e times, the hour of &s;upper. His
<PB N="217" REF="233">evening meal was &s;paring. Often he eat nothing: and when that was the ca&s;e, it was his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, as he &s;at down to table, to draw on a pair of gloves; which was as much as to &s;ay, that his hands had nothing to do. After &s;upper, he &s;pent an hour in walking, and another in his &s;tudy, retiring to his bed-chamber about nine.</P>
<P>This was his u&s;ual mode of living, when he was mo&s;t vacant; but very often his afternoons as well as his mornings, were engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s. To this his che&s;s-hour after dinner was commonly fir&s;t a&s;&s;igned, and the remainder of the afternoon, as the occa&s;ion required. He generally however contrived, if po&s;&s;ible, even in the bu&s;ie&s;t day, to devote &s;ome proportion of his time to his books, be|&s;ides the morning. And Mr. Fox tells us, he always accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to read, and write in a &s;tanding po&s;ture; e&s;teeming con&s;tant &s;itting very pernicious to a &s;tu|dious man.</P>
<P>His learning was chiefly confined to his profe&s;&s;ion. He had applied him&s;elf in Cambridge to the &s;tudy of the Greek
<PB N="218" REF="234">and Hebrew languages; which tho e&s;|teemed at that time as the mark of here&s;y, appeared to him the only &s;ources of at|taining a critical knowledge of the &s;crip|tures. He had &s;o accurately &s;tudied ca|non-law; that he was e&s;teemed the be&s;t canoni&s;t in England: and his reading in theology was &s;o exten&s;ive, and his collec|tions from the fathers &s;o very voluminous, that there were few points, in which he was not accurately informed; and on which he could not give the opinions of the &s;everal ages of the church from the times of the apo&s;tles. <Q>If I had not &s;een with my own eyes, &s;ays Peter Martyr, I could not ea&s;ily have believed, with what infinite pains and labour, he had dige&s;ted his great reading into par|ticular chapters, under the heads of councils, canons, decrees, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>His parts were &s;olid, rather than &s;hin|ing; and his memory &s;uch, that it might be called an index to the books he had read; and the collections he had made.</P>
<P>Henry the eighth had &s;uch an opinion of him, as a ca&s;ui&s;t, that he would often &s;ay, <Q>He could have no difficulty, while
<PB N="219" REF="235">Cranmer was at his elbow.</Q> And indeed we cannot better account for the con&s;tant regard, which that capricious monarch &s;hewed him, than by &s;uppo&s;ing, it proceeded from the opinion the king had of the archbi&s;hop's being &s;o u&s;eful to him. It was not an unu&s;ual thing for Henry to &s;end him a ca&s;e of con&s;cience at night (and Henry's con&s;cience was very often troubled) de&s;iring an an&s;wer the next morning. On &s;uch &s;lender no|tice, we are told, the archbi&s;hop would often collect the opinions of twenty, or thirty writers on the &s;ubject; and within the limited time would &s;end all the ex|tracts, together with his own conclu&s;ion on the whole.</P>
<P>Henry, who was deeper in &s;chool-divinity, than in any other kind of learn|ing, would take great plea&s;ure al&s;o in di&s;puting with the archbi&s;hop; and not|with&s;tanding the roughne&s;s of his man|ners, would often indulge that &s;ort of familiarity, which emboldened tho&s;e a|bout him, to u&s;e freedom with him. The archbi&s;hop at lea&s;t was &s;eldom under any difficulty on that head; while the
<PB N="220" REF="236">king on his part always paid much defer|ence to the primate's learning, and abi|lities, (tho the primate was the only per&s;on to whom he did pay any deference) and would &s;ometimes do it at the expence of tho&s;e, who thought them&s;elves on an equality with the mo&s;t learned. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter in particular the king would &s;ometimes delight to mortify; and to &s;et him on the wrong &s;ide of a compari&s;on with the archbi&s;hop.&mdash;We have an in&s;tance pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>The king once engaged the two pre|lates in a di&s;pute on the authority of the apo&s;tolical canons; in which he him&s;elf bore a part. The archbi&s;hop &s;u&s;tained the negative. As the di&s;pute proceeded, the king, either &s;en&s;ible of the primate's &s;uperiority, or affecting to appear &s;o, cried out, <Q>Come, come, bi&s;hop Win|che&s;ter, we mu&s;t leave him, we mu&s;t leave him: He is too old a truant for either of us.</Q></P>
<P>He was a &s;en&s;ible writer; rather ner|vous, than elegant. His writings were entirely confined to the great controver&s;y, which then &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and contain the
<PB N="221" REF="237">whole &s;um of the theological learning of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>His library was filled with a very noble collection of books; and was open to all men of letters. <Q>I meet with authors here, Roger A&s;cham would &s;ay, which the two univer&s;ities cannot furni&s;h.</Q></P>
<P>At the archbi&s;hop's death the greater part of his original MSS. were left at his palace of Ford near Canterbury; where they fell into the hands of his enemies.</P>
<P>In the days of Elizabeth, archbi&s;hop Parker, who had an intimation, that many of them were &s;till in being, ob|tained an order from Lord Burleigh, then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in the year 1563, to &s;earch for them in all &s;u&s;pected places; and recovered a great number of them. They found their way afterwards into &s;ome of the principal libraries of England; but the greate&s;t collection of them were depo&s;ited in Bennet-college in Cambridge.</P>

<P>But the light, in which archbi&s;hop Cranmer appears to mo&s;t advantage, is in that of a reformer, conclucting the great work of a religious e&s;tabli&s;hment; for which he &s;eems to have had all the nece&s;&s;ary qualifications. He was candid, liberal, and open to truth in a great de|gree. Many of his opinions he recon|&s;idered and altered; even in his advanced age. Nor was he ever a&s;hamed of owning it; which is in effect, he thought, being a&s;hamed of owning, that a man is wi&s;er to-day than he was ye&s;terday. When his old tenets with regard to the Lord's &s;upper, were objected to him; he replied with great &s;implicity; <Q>I grant that formerly I believed otherwi&s;e than I do now; and &s;o I did, until my lord of London (Dr. Ridley) did confer with me, and by &s;undry arguments, and
<PB N="223" REF="239">authorities of doctors, draw me quite from my per&s;ua&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>To the opinions of others al&s;o he was very indulgent. One fact indeed, men|tioned in his life, the death of G. Paris is a glaring in&s;tance of the contrary. Something, no doubt, &s;o good a man would have to &s;ay for him&s;elf, if we could hear his plea, in vindication of &s;o barbarous, and horrid a piece of bigotry: but as the naked fact now &s;tands, we can only expre&s;s our a&s;toni&s;hment, that a &s;in|gle action &s;hould &s;o gro&s;ly run counter to every other action of his life.</P>
<P>The uncommon caution of his temper likewi&s;e qualified him greatly as a refor|mer. In his conver&s;ation he was re|markably guarded. <Q>Three words of his, &s;ays Lloyd, could do more, than three hours di&s;cour&s;e of others.</Q> In acting he always felt his ground, as he proceeded; and had the &s;ingular wi&s;dom to forbear attempting things, however de&s;irable, which could not be attained. He rarely admitted any circum&s;tances into his &s;chemes, which ought to have been left out; and as rarely left out any
<PB N="224" REF="240">which ought to have been admitted. Hence it was, that he &s;o happily accom|pli&s;hed the mo&s;t difficult of all works, that of loo&s;ening the prejudices of man|kind. Hence it was al&s;o, that the ground which he took, was &s;o firm, as &s;carce to leave any part of the foundation he laid, under the nece&s;&s;ity of being &s;trengthened.</P>
<P>The &s;weetne&s;s of his manners al&s;o con|tributed not a little to the completion of his de&s;igns. He was a man of a mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;ition. His countenance was always inlightened with that chear|ful &s;mile, that made every body approach him with plea&s;ure. It is indeed &s;ur|prizing, how much he was beloved, and how few enemies he made, when we con&s;ider that his whole life was a con&s;tant oppo&s;ition to the opinions and prejudices of the times. Whom he could not per|&s;uade, he never di&s;obliged. A har&s;h mea&s;ure he con&s;idered only as another name for an imprudent one. When he could not go on &s;moothly, he would re|treat a few &s;teps; and take other ground, till he perceived the ob&s;truction was re|moved.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="241">The compo&s;ure of his temper was another happy ingredient in his character as a reformer. It was rarely on any oc|ca&s;ion either rai&s;ed or depre&s;&s;ed. His features were by no means an index to the times. His mo&s;t intimate friends could form no conjecture from his outward be|haviour (which was always flowing with benignity) whether he had met with any thing either in parliament, or in council, to di&s;turb him.</P>
<P>One can &s;carce on this occa&s;ion avoid a compari&s;on between him, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or archbi&s;hop Laud. Both were good men&mdash;both were equally zealous for religion&mdash;and both were engaged in the work of reformation.&mdash;I mean not to enter into the affair of introducing epi&s;copacy in Scotland; nor to throw any favourable light on the eccle&s;ia&s;tical views of tho&s;e times. I am at pre&s;ent only con&s;idering the mea&s;ures which the two archbi&s;hops took in forwarding their re|&s;pective plans. While Cranmer pur&s;ued his with that caution and temper, which
<PB N="226" REF="242">we have ju&s;t been examining; Laud, in the violence of his integrity, (for he was certainly a well-meaning man) making allowances neither for men, nor opinions, was determined to carry all before him. The con&s;equence was, that he did no|thing, which he attempted; while Cran|mer did every thing. And it is probable, that if Henry had cho&s;en &s;uch an in&s;tru|ment as Laud, he would have mi&s;carried in his point: while Charles with &s;uch a primate as Cranmer, would either have been &s;ucce&s;sful in his &s;chemes, or at lea&s;t have avoided the fatal con&s;equences that en&s;ued.&mdash;But I &s;peak of the&s;e things merely as a politician. Providence, no doubt, over-ruling the ways of men, rai&s;es up, on all occa&s;ions, &s;uch in&s;tru|ments as are mo&s;t proper to carry on its &s;chemes; &s;ometimes by promoting, and &s;ometimes by defeating, the purpo&s;es of mankind.</P>

<P>Nor was the good archbi&s;hop le&s;s formed for a private, than a public &s;ta|tion. While we revere the virtues of the reformer, we admire the mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>His humility was truly apo&s;tolical. He was aver&s;e to the &s;ounding titles of the clergy; and when the&s;e things, among others, were &s;ettled, he would often &s;ay, "We might well do without them." A familiar expre&s;&s;ion of his, on an occa|&s;ion of this kind, was often afterwards remembered. He had &s;igned him&s;elf in &s;ome public in&s;trument, as he was obliged indeed legally to do, by the &s;tyle of <HI>pri|mate of all England.</HI> At this the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter took great offence: inti|mating, that there was no nece&s;&s;ity for that innovation; and throwing out a hint, as if it were an encroachment on the king's &s;upremacy. <Q>God knows, &s;aid
<PB N="228" REF="244">the archbi&s;hop, (when he heard of the invidious things, which Winche&s;ter had &s;aid) I value the title of primate, no more than I do the <HI>paring of an apple.</HI></Q> The expre&s;&s;ion was afterwards often quoted by tho&s;e, who were di&s;inclin|ed to all dignities in the church; which they would call in contempt the <HI>parings of Cranmer's apples.</HI></P>
<P>The placability of his temper was equal to his humility. No man ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more chri&s;tian charity. The lea&s;t &s;ign of penitence in an enemy re&s;tored him immediately to favour; and the archbi|&s;hop was glad of an opportunity of &s;hew|ing the &s;incerity of his reconciliation. This was &s;o well known to be a part of his character, that the archbi&s;hop of York having long, in vain, de&s;ired his concur|rence in a bu&s;ine&s;s, to which Cranmer was aver&s;e; <Q>Well, my lord, &s;aid York, if I cannot have my &s;uit in one way, I will in another. I &s;hall pre&s;ently do your grace &s;ome &s;hrewd turn; and then, I doubt not, but I can manage &s;o, as to obtain my reque&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="245">But the archbi&s;hop's mildne&s;s and placability never appeared in &s;o &s;trong a light, as when contra&s;ted, as they often were, with the vehemence of Henry's pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>A per&s;on of great rank at court, who was the archbi&s;hop's &s;ecret enemy, and had oftener than once done him ill offi|ces, came to him, one day, to reque&s;t his intere&s;t with the king. The primate with great readine&s;s undertook his cau&s;e. "Do you know, &s;aid the king, &s;uprized at his reque&s;t, for whom you are making &s;uit? Are you acquainted with the man's di&s;po&s;ilion towards you?" "I always took him, &s;aid the archbi&s;hop, for my friend." "No, replied the king; he is your mortal enemy: and &s;o far am I from granting his rcque&s;t, that I com|mand you, when you &s;ee him next, to call him knave." The archbi&s;hop beg|ged his maje&s;ty would not oblige him to u&s;e language &s;o little becoming a chri&s;tian bi&s;hop. But Henry vociferated again, "I command you, I &s;ay, to call him knave; and tell him that I ordered you." The primate however could not be per|&s;uaded,
<PB N="230" REF="246">by all his maje&s;ty's eloquence, to call the man knave: and the king, tho in great agitation at fir&s;t, was obli|ged, at la&s;t, to give up the matter with a &s;mile.</P>
<P>He was a very amiable ma&s;ter in his family; and admirably pre&s;erved the difficult medium between indulgence, and re&s;traint. He had; according to the cu&s;tom of the times, a very numerous retinue; among whom the mo&s;t exact order was ob&s;erved. Every week the &s;teward of his hou&s;ehold held a kind of court in the great hall of his palace, in which all family affairs were &s;ettled; &s;ervants wages were paid; complaints were heard; and faults examined. De|linquents were publicly rebuked; and after the third admonition di&s;charged.</P>
<P>His ho&s;pitality and charities were great, and noble: equal to his &s;tation; greater often than his abilities.</P>
<P>A plentiful table was among the virtues of tho&s;e days. His was always bounti|fully covered. In an upper room was
<PB N="231" REF="247">&s;pread his own; where he &s;eldom wanted company of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction. Here a great many learned foreigners were daily entertained; and partook of his bounty. In his great hall a long table was plenti|fully covered, every day, for gue&s;ts, and &s;trangers of a lower rank; at the upper end of which were three &s;maller tables, de&s;igned for his own officers; and inferior gentlemen.</P>
<P>The learned Tremellius, who had him|&s;elf often been an eye-witne&s;s of the archbi&s;hop's ho&s;pitality, gives this cha|racter of it: "<HI>Archiepi&s;copi domus, publi|cum erat doctis, et piis omnibus ho&s;pitium; quod ip&s;e ho&s;pes, Mecoenas, et pater, talibus &s;emper patere voluit, quoad vixit, aut po|tuit; homo</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>nec minus</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">."</P>
<P>We have &s;een his character a&s;per&s;ed for want of ho&s;pitality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 103.</NOTE>. In part the a&s;per|&s;ion might have ari&s;en from an attempt he made, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other bi&s;hops, to regulate the tables of the clergy; which had lately taken an ex|pen&s;ive turn. This expence was intro|duced
<PB N="232" REF="248">by the regular clergy, who could not lay a&s;ide the ho&s;pitable ideas of their mona&s;teries; tho a country benefice would by no means &s;upport them. The regu|lations publi&s;hed on this occa&s;ion, ordered, that <Q>an archbi&s;hop's table &s;hould not exceed &s;ix divers kinds of fle&s;h; or as many of fi&s;h, on fi&s;h-days.&mdash;A bi&s;hop's &s;hould not exceed five: a dean's four: and none, under that degree, &s;hould exceed three. In a &s;econd cour&s;e, an archbi&s;hop was allowed four di&s;hes&mdash;a bi&s;hop three&mdash;all others two&mdash;as cu&s;|tards, tarts, fritters, chee&s;e, apples and pears. But if any inferior &s;hould en|tertain a &s;uperior, either of the clergy, or laity, he might make provi&s;ion ac|cording to the degree of his gue&s;t. If any archbi&s;hop, or other eccle&s;ia&s;tic, entertained an amba&s;&s;ador, his diet need not be limited.&mdash;It was farther ordered, that of the greater fi&s;h, or fowl, as haddoc, pike, tench, cranes, turkies, &s;wans, there &s;hould only be one in a di&s;h: of le&s;s kinds, as capons, phea|&s;ants, wood-cocks, but two. Of the
<PB N="233" REF="249">&s;till le&s;s fowls, an archbi&s;hop might have three; all under him only two.</Q></P>
<P>Among other in&s;tances of the arch|bi&s;hop's charity, we have one recorded, which was truly noble. After the de|&s;truction of mona&s;teries, and before ho&s;|pitals were erected, the nation &s;aw no &s;pecies of greater mi&s;ery, than that of wounded, and di&s;banded &s;oldiers. For the u&s;e of &s;uch mi&s;erable objects, as were landed on the &s;outhern coa&s;ts of the i&s;land, the archbi&s;hop fitted up his manor-hou&s;e of Becke&s;burn in Kent. He formed it indeed into a compleat ho&s;pital; appoint|ing a phy&s;ician, a &s;urgeon, nur&s;es; and every thing proper, as well for food, as phy&s;ic. Nor did his charity &s;top here. Each man, on his recovery, was furni&s;hed with money to carry him home, in pro|portion to the di&s;tance of his abode.</P>
<P>To obviate all the cavils of the papi&s;ts again&s;t archbi&s;hop Cranmer, would be to enter into the general argument again&s;t them. His apo&s;tacy, his marriage, and his opinions, are que&s;tions all of common
<PB N="234" REF="250">controver&s;y. On the particular mi&s;car|riages of his life I have every where touched as they occurred; and have by no means &s;pared them, when they ap|peared to de&s;erve cen&s;ure. The general objection, which &s;eems to bear the hea|vie&s;t upon him, is founded on the pliancy of his temper. Saunders, one of the bittere&s;t of his enemies, &s;arca&s;tically calls him <HI>Henricianus;</HI> and his friends indeed find it no ea&s;y matter to wipe off the&s;e courtly &s;tains. Without que&s;tion, many in&s;tances of great conde&s;cen&s;ion in his character &s;trike us; but a blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of princes was probably con|sidered among the chri&s;tian virtues of tho&s;e days.</P>
<P>On the other hand, when we &s;ee him &s;ingly, and frequently, oppo&s;e the fury of an inflamed tyrant&mdash;when we &s;ee him make that noble &s;tand again&s;t bigotry in the affair of the &s;ix articles&mdash;or when we &s;ee him the only per&s;on, who dur&s;t inform a pa&s;&s;ionate, and jealous prince of the in|fidelity of a favourite wife, we cannot but allow, there was great firmne&s;s in his character; and mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that he
<PB N="235" REF="251">drew a line in his own con&s;cience to direct him, in what matters he ought, and in what matters he ought not, to comply with his prince's will.</P>
<P>He left behind him a widow and children; but as he always kept his fa|mily in ob&s;curity, for prudential rea&s;ons, we know little about them. They had been kindly provided for, by Henry the eighth, who without any &s;ollicitation from the primate him&s;elf, gave him a con&s;i|derable grant from the abbey of Welbeck in Nottingham&s;hire; which his family enjoyed after his decea&s;e. King Edward made &s;ome addition to his private fortune: and his heirs were re&s;tored in blood by an act of parliament, in the reign of Eliza|beth.</P>
