<P>OBSERVATIONS, RELATIVE CHIEFLY TO PICTURESQUE BEAUTY, Made in the YEAR 1776, On &s;everal PARTS of GREAT BRITAIN; PARTICULARLY THE HIGH-LANDS of SCOTLAND.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE EARL HARCOURT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BESIDES your Lord&s;hip's great attachment to the polite arts, I have other rea&s;ons for placing your name before the&s;e papers. If you will accept this addre&s;s as an in&s;tance of my gratitude, I leave it to the world to judge of it's propriety.</P>
<P>In peru&s;ing the&s;e remarks your Lord&s;hip will be plea&s;ed to recollect, they were written in the year 1776;
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
&s;ince which time many of the arti|ficial &s;cenes taken notice of in them, have probably undergone great im|provement. In &s;uch in&s;tances I only &s;hew how much has been done, by &s;hewing how much was wanting.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of the&s;e volumes, my Lord, is &s;o nearly that of a late publication on the lakes, and moun|tains of Cumberland, that &s;imilar ideas mu&s;t of cour&s;e frequently oc|cur. In this ca&s;e I have en|deavoured to vary my object by throwing different lights upon it&mdash; and to vary my remarks by throwing them on different circum&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">In the work I have ju&s;t alluded to, many thought my language too luxuriant&mdash;particularly a friend of your Lord&s;hip's, who&s;e practice in ver&s;ification makes his ta&s;te the more ea&s;ily offended, when pro&s;e, deviat|ing into poetical phra&s;e, tran&s;gre&s;&s;es it's proper bounds. Your Lord&s;hip's correct judgment may probably like|wi&s;e have taken offence on this head. I can only &s;ay, I endeavoured, as I could, to adapt my language to my &s;ubject; and as <HI>picture&s;que de&s;cription</HI> was rather a novel mode of writing, I thought I had &s;ome little right to adopt my own. But as I find many of my friends di&s;allow my apology, I &s;ubmit; con&s;cious that
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
no man is a proper judge in his own ca&s;e. I have endeavoured therefore to make the following ob&s;ervations le&s;s liable to that objection.</P>
<P>But however ju&s;tly I may have been cen&s;ured on this head, I have heard other critici&s;ms, founded on plain ignorance of the &s;ubject. Pic|ture&s;que ideas lie not in the com|mon road of genius and learning. They require perhaps a di&s;tinct fa|culty to comprehend them&mdash;at lea&s;t they require more attention to the &s;cenes of nature, and the rules of art, than men of letters in general, unle&s;s &s;timulated by a peculiar in|clination, be&s;tow upon them. Such men therefore are improper judges.
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
If your Lord&s;hip's name, and coun|tenance can &s;kreen me from critics of this kind, I &s;hall rejoice at hav|ing &s;ecured my&s;elf behind &s;o good a &s;hield.</P>
<P>On the whole, if my remarks are &s;o fortunate as to meet your Lord&s;hip's approbation; I have little doubt, but it will be an earne&s;t of the approbation of the public. I am, my Lord, with great re&s;pect,</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON SEVERAL Parts of GREAT BRITAIN; PARTICULARLY THE HIGHLANDS of SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>IN this excur&s;ion we propo&s;ed to vi&s;it &s;ome of the more remarkable &s;cenes in Scotland; and in our journey through England, &s;ome parts of it al&s;o, which we had not &s;een be|fore.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the wild, open country of Enfield-chace, lately de&s;poiled by act of par|liament of it's trees; and having left the &s;weet woodlands of Hertford&s;hire; our views
<PB N="2" REF="19">
became coar&s;e, and unplea&s;ant. The fa|tiguing uniformity of them was, here and there, ju&s;t relieved by a di&s;tance; particularly at Al|conbury-hill.</P>
<P>From hence among other remote objects, that large piece of water, called Whittle&s;ey|mere, makes a con&s;iderable appearance, &s;tretch|ing into length, far to the right. You get a &s;ight of it from other parts of the road; and if the foreground happen in any degree to ri&s;e, you may &s;ee perhaps a point of land pu&s;hing out into the water: but, in general, it appears only a long narrow &s;lip, without form. The eye however makes &s;ome judgment of it's length, which is two leagues; tho none of it's breadth, which is at lea&s;t one. It's di|men&s;ions are larger than mo&s;t of the Cum|berland lakes; yet through it's want of ac|companiments, it's flat &s;hores, and vile neigh|bourhood of fens, and mar&s;hes, of which it is the great drain, few travellers de&s;ire to &s;ee more of it than is exhibited from the road.</P>
<P>To the inhabitants of it's &s;hores however it is a great &s;ource both of <HI>u&s;e,</HI> and <HI>amu&s;ement.</HI> It abounds with fi&s;h: and the winds being more con&s;tant here, than in a lake &s;urrounded with mountains, where they blow in gu&s;ts,
<PB N="3" REF="20">
and eddies, a boat is more manageable, and &s;ailing a more agreeable amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>In Dani&s;h times Whittle&s;ey-mere was con|&s;idered as a great inland &s;ea, and navigated only in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity. Camden tells us, from an old hi&s;tory of Ely, that it was once the &s;cene of a great calamity. When Canute re&s;ided at Peterborough, his children, and others of the royal family, had occa&s;ion to go to the abbey of Ram&s;ey. Whittle&s;ey-mere lay di|rectly in the way. Here they embarked; when <HI>in the mid&s;t of their plea&s;ant voyage, and their &s;inging, and jollity, the turbulent winds, and a tempe&s;tuous &s;torm aro&s;e;</HI> their ve&s;&s;el foun|dered; and the greate&s;t part of the royal family peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>About the &s;ixty-ninth &s;tone, the view is beautifully confined by <HI>Monk's woods.</HI> As we approach Stamford, the country, tho every where full of little varieties, is on the whole rather flat.</P>
<P>From Stamford we vi&s;ited Burleigh-hou&s;e; which is a place of great magnificence. It
<PB N="4" REF="21">
has no advantage of &s;ituation; being buried in the dip of a park, which indeed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no where much agreeable &s;cenery. The hou&s;e formerly was approached by de&s;cending avenues; which were as di&s;plea&s;ing, as formality, and awkwardne&s;s could make them. Mr. Brown was employed to reform them; and if po&s;&s;ible to give &s;ome air of elegance to the approach. Much he could not do. The &s;ituation of the hou&s;e forbad; and the unaccommodating form of the park. Every thing however, that was di&s;gu&s;ting he has removed. He has clo&s;ed the avenues: he has varied the &s;lopes; and has led the approach through a winding val|ley, in the very path, which nature would have cho&s;en, as the ea&s;ie&s;t. The magic of the&s;e improvements is &s;uch, that it has given the hou&s;e a new &s;ite. It appears, as you approach it, to a&s;&s;ume even an elevated &s;ta|tion.&mdash;But the <HI>&s;cenery</HI> about Burleigh is not the object: it is the <HI>hou&s;e</HI> chiefly which at|tracts the traveller.</P>
<P>Burleigh-hou&s;e is one of the noble&s;t mo|numents of Briti&s;h architecture in the times of Elizabeth, when the great outlines of magnificence were rudely drawn, but unim|proved by ta&s;te. The architect, till lately,
<PB N="5" REF="22">
was unknown; as indeed we know very little of the architects of tho&s;e days. But the earl of Warwick has a book of original plans in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by John Thorpe; from which it appears, that he was the architect of Burleigh hou&s;e. It is an im|men&s;e pile, forming the four &s;ides of a large court; and tho decorated with a variety of fanta&s;tic ornaments according to the fa&s;hion of the time, before Grecian architecture had introduced &s;ymmetry, proportion, and elegance into the plans of private hou&s;es, it has &s;till an augu&s;t appearance. The in&s;ide of the court is particularly &s;triking. The &s;pire is neither, I think, in it&s;elf an ornament; nor has it any effect; except at a di&s;tance, where it contributes to give this whole immen&s;e pile, the con&s;equence of a town.</P>
<P>How far the fa&s;hionable array, in which Mr. Brown has dre&s;&s;ed the grounds about this venerable building, agree with it's for|mality, and antique appendages, I dare not take upon me to &s;ay. A doubt ari&s;es, whether the old decoration of avenues, and parterres was not in a more <HI>&s;uitable</HI> &s;tile of ornament. It is however a nice que&s;tion, and would admit many plau&s;ible arguments on both &s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="23">The rooms are fitted up in that rich, but &s;olemn manner, which the magnificence of the hou&s;e requires. Some of them indeed, which had been long di&s;u&s;ed, are now adorned in a lighter ta&s;te: but their uniformity is lo&s;t.&mdash;The grand &s;tair-ca&s;e, and many of the ceilings are painted by Verrio, who &s;pent twelve years, we were informed, in this work; during which time he had a hand&s;ome pen|&s;ion; a table kept; and an equipage. Verrio was a man of extraordinary pomp; and had been &s;o carre&s;&s;ed by Charles the &s;econd, that he thought him&s;elf a capital arti&s;t. He was a painter, as Mr. Walpole ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, who&s;e <HI>exuberant pencil was well adapted to adorn tho&s;e public &s;urfaces, on which the eye never re&s;ts long enough to criticize:</HI> but he was certainly not worth the attention, which lord Exeter paid him; tho his works at Burleigh are confe&s;&s;edly the mo&s;t correct of any he has left behind him.</P>
<P>Painted ceilings however are at be&s;t, I think, but awkward ornaments; not only as it is impo&s;&s;ible to examine them without pain; but al&s;o as the fore&s;hortening of the figures, which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to give them any kind of effect, is &s;o contrary to what we
<PB N="7" REF="24">
&s;ee in common life, that it is di&s;gu&s;ting. Mr. Pope al&s;o, with his u&s;ual ju&s;t ta&s;te, &s;ugge&s;ts another objection to them. He &s;peaks of <HI>the &s;prawling &s;aints of Verrio, and Laguerre:</HI> by which expre&s;&s;ion he &s;eems to con&s;ider them as floundring in &s;ome &s;trange medium, we know not what, which affords them no &s;table footing. Figures indeed repre&s;ented <HI>in the clouds,</HI> are not &s;o obvious to this ex|ception. We can bear however to &s;ee &s;uch an arti&s;t as Verrio employed on a ceiling; but when we &s;ee a ma&s;ter, like Rubens &s;o engaged, it is mortifying.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till a painted ceiling, if the colours are rich, and dark, adds a plea&s;ing &s;olemnity to the&s;e antique man&s;ions: but we wi&s;h only for elegant, ornamental &s;crolls. It is merely the <HI>general effect of the gloom</HI> that plea&s;es; as in a chapel we are &s;oothed with that &s;olemn light, which pa&s;&s;es through painted gla&s;s; tho we wi&s;h neither for figures, nor any other form of creation.</P>
<P>In rooms of a lighter ta&s;te, as they are gene|rally now fitted up in great hou&s;es, more airy ceilings are &s;uitable. Lightne&s;s and gaiety in furniture is now the fa&s;hion; cor|re&s;ponding more perhaps with the manners
<PB N="8" REF="25">
of the times. The manners of the great were formerly, re&s;erved, grave, and dignified. Their apartments, of cour&s;e contracted a more &s;olemn air. They were hung with darker colours; to which the furniture was adapted. How far the manners of tho&s;e days were more agreeable, I know not: but I have no &s;cruple in giving the preference to their apartments. Awkwardne&s;&s;es there might be, and certainly were: I &s;peak only of their <HI>general air.</HI></P>
<P>The pictures in Burleigh-hou&s;e, of which there is great profu&s;ion, are highly valued. Indeed we &s;eldom find a better collection. They are in general plea&s;ing. In the chapel, which is adapted rather to <HI>amu&s;ement,</HI> than <HI>devotion,</HI> hang &s;everal very &s;hewy pictures. Solomon's idolatry, and Mo&s;es in the ru&s;hes, both by Loti, are &s;uch. The altar-piece, by P. Verone&s;e is more cla&s;&s;ical; but it is &s;o deficient as a <HI>whole,</HI> that we could admire only &s;ome of the <HI>parts.</HI> Among the&s;e the head of St. James is wonderfully expre&s;&s;ive. The death of Seneca by L. Giordano, is e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t pictures in the col|lection: but it is wanting, both in <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> and in <HI>effect of light.</HI> Either of the&s;e requi|&s;ites
<PB N="9" REF="26">
will contribute greatly to an <HI>agreeable whole:</HI> but when a picture is deficient in <HI>both,</HI> the eye cannot re&s;t upon it with plea&s;ure. The pa&s;&s;ion of grief is indeed well di&s;tributed among the attendants of the dying philo&s;opher: but it is conveyed through the medium of very awkward characters.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not leave this grand hou&s;e without looking into the kitchen; which is a noble room; and decorated with the en&s;ign armorial of ho&s;pitality, an immen&s;e carca&s;e of beef well painted.</P>
<P>From Burleigh-hou&s;e, we vi&s;ited a more retired man&s;ion, which this noble family po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es at Stamford. The family-vault there is a curious &s;cene of the kind. Here lies the old &s;tate&s;man of queen Elizabeth; with a numerous race of his de&s;cendants collected around him. Even in the&s;e &s;ilent regions are found the vanities of dre&s;s. The ancients of the hou&s;e are clad in plain lead and &s;tone; but you trace the progre&s;s of fa&s;hion in the decorations of &s;ucceeding ages. Many, who came la&s;t from the upper regions, are adorned in crim&s;on velvet, coronets, and lace; and
<PB N="10" REF="27">
figure away in the&s;e cells of darkne&s;s. One would think the grave had little to do with vanity: but our foibles adhere to our la&s;t &s;and. It has ever been &s;o.</P>

<P>FROM Stamford we proceeded to Newark, through Col&s;terworth, a neighbourhood famous for giving birth to Sir I&s;aac Newton. This whole tract of country affords little that is amu&s;ing, till we come to <HI>Gunner&s;by-hill;</HI> from whence we have a very exten&s;ive view. The grounds, on which the eye immediately falls, are level &s;heep-walks, with few inter|&s;ections, but no way offen&s;ive. Di&s;tant views &s;eldom enjoy this advantage. The near grounds, when cultivated are always formal and di&s;gu&s;ting. Here they were uncultivated and plea&s;ing. Beyond the &s;heep-walks a va&s;t &s;tretch of flat country, inriched with a variety of indi&s;tinct objects, melts into the horizon. It con&s;i&s;ts only of the common features of a flat di&s;tance; but they are uncom|monly broad and ample.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="29">Through this country the Trent takes it's cour&s;e, tho it rarely <HI>appears</HI> in any part. No river in England is &s;ubject to &s;uch wide, and la&s;ting inundations: and on in&s;pecting the map of the country, as it lay now before us, we wanted no geometrical level to convince us, that when the waters of this &s;luggi&s;h &s;tream become once &s;woln, it's floods mu&s;t be diffu&s;ive, and of long continuance: for there appears to be no where any de&s;cent to carry them off. The &s;cenery before us was finely varied, when we &s;urveyed it, by floating lights, which &s;preading over one part, and another, &s;hewed us every part by turns. No|thing in land&s;cape is more beautiful than the&s;e lengthened gleams<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See other remarks on this &s;ubject in treating of the <HI>floating lights</HI> on Skiddaw, near the clo&s;e of the&s;e ob&s;ervations.</NOTE>. The Dutch ma&s;ters who painted from a flat country, knew the force of their effect, and often introduced them.</P>
<P>When the di&s;tance con&s;i&s;ts, as it does here, of a va&s;t <HI>flat &s;urface,</HI> the painter cannot well manage it without the&s;e adventitious lights. It would be one heavy fatiguing tint. And
<PB N="13" REF="30">
yet <HI>too many</HI> of the&s;e gleams occa&s;ion what the arti&s;ts call a <HI>&s;pottine&s;s</HI> in land&s;cape. Two at mo&s;t are &s;ufficient: and if two, there &s;hould always be a &s;ubordination between them. The nearer may be broader, and more vivid; leaving the more di&s;tant a mere &s;trip.</P>
<P>When the di&s;tance, tho very exten&s;ive, is <HI>not merely a flat,</HI> but is varied with pro|minent parts, it may &s;upport it's con&s;equence, tho the whole be in &s;hadow. It will it&s;elf produce variety. A knoll may run out, of &s;uch con&s;picuous &s;ize, that according to the common rules of keeping, it will naturally be inve&s;ted with a deeper tint, than the coun|try, which lies beyond it: for as it's greater height intercepts a portion of that country, it is &s;een again&s;t a part more remote than it&s;elf; and will of cour&s;e be tinted with a darker hue. Thus al&s;o the &s;pot, or mote (which the eye conceives to be a ca&s;tle, a clump of trees, or &s;ome other object in the di&s;tance), is tinted with a darker touch; becau&s;e in the &s;ame manner, it is &s;een again&s;t a country more remote than it&s;elf, and con&s;equently lighter. Even the folding of ri&s;ing grounds over each other, will pro|duce
<PB N="14" REF="31">
the &s;ame effect. The nearer ground intercepting a valley will always appear darker. Tho the inaccurate ob&s;erver therefore may think a di&s;tant land&s;cape, when in &s;hadow, might be repre&s;ented by one broad da&s;h of <HI>equal colour,</HI> excepting only what difference the gradation of &s;hade occa&s;ions, he is mi&s;taken. Simplicity and breadth are every where plea&s;ing; and particularly in di&s;tance; but &s;till if the <HI>inequalities of a &s;urface</HI> are not attended to, and marked by a di&s;crimination, however &s;light; the picture may appear unnatural to an eye, which may not have knowledge enough in keeping, and the per&s;pective of nature, to &s;ugge&s;t a rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Under every circum&s;tance a country re|tiring into remote di&s;tance, is among the mo&s;t beautiful parts of land&s;cape, and is a very plea&s;ing &s;tudy to a lover of nature. If he be a true di&s;ciple of nature; and attend clo&s;ely to all her variations of weather&mdash;of &s;ea&s;ons&mdash;of morning, and evening &s;uns, he will di&s;cover, more and more, her magical &s;ecrets in the illumination of di&s;tant objects. He will &s;ee with what vivid touches of light &s;he often marks each prominent part&mdash;nearly as vivid as tho&s;e upon the foregrounds.&mdash;At
<PB N="15" REF="32">
the &s;ame time the &s;hadows being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and every little detail; the object takes it's proper place in the di&s;tance, notwith&s;tanding it's &s;trong illumination.&mdash;Yet even in a di&s;tance he will ob&s;erve a variety of little animated touches, which give it life, and &s;pirit. He will &s;tudy nature's mode of expre&s;&s;ing the&s;e touches&mdash;the tuftings of the fore&s;t, the rough|ne&s;s of the mountain, and the &s;tillne&s;s of the lake.&mdash;He will ob&s;erve al&s;o what di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ky gives that cold blue tint to a removed country, which we &s;ometimes &s;ee&mdash;what again gives it that clearne&s;s, in which the very delineation of every object may be di&s;|cerned&mdash;and what throws over it that greyi&s;h tint, the &s;weete&s;t of all hues that inve&s;t a di&s;tance; and gives it that amu&s;ing indi&s;tinct|ne&s;s, which leads the imagination of the &s;pectator to

As we de&s;cended Gunner&s;by hill, and &s;aw more around it, a di&s;tinct view of Belvoir-ca&s;tle opened on the left: and we could have wi&s;hed to have examined that noble repo&s;itory
<PB N="16" REF="33">
of the works of eminent ma&s;ters; but our time would not allow.</P>
<P>As we got more into the flat country, we found, that however qualified it's objects were, to melt into a beautiful di&s;tance, it contain|ed nothing engaging on the &s;pot. All the country through which the Trent flows, as far as we could command it from the great road, is unpicture&s;que.</P>
<P>Newark was formerly defended by a ca&s;tle; which is now but an unplea&s;ing ruin. It has more the appearance of a dwelling, than a for|tre&s;s. It was once however a con&s;iderable place, and at the conclu&s;ion of the civil wars, &s;u&s;tained a &s;iege of &s;even months from the whole Scotch army; during which period, in the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, tho&s;e &s;hillings in the form of lozenges were &s;tamped, which are now found in collections of old coins. They bear a crown on one &s;ide, in&s;cribed C. R.; and on the other, mark the occa&s;ion of their being &s;truck. Here al&s;o began that infamous treaty for the &s;ale of the king, who had delivered him&s;elf into the hands of the Scotch army, of which the whole nation hath de&s;ervedly

<P>From Newark the country &s;till continues dreary and unintere&s;ting. When the road happens to make any little ri&s;e, we had, far to the right, a di&s;tant view of Lincoln-cathe|dral, over the flats between it and the eye. It is &s;o noble a pile, that it makes a re&s;pec|table object at the di&s;tance of twenty miles. But this extraordinary appearance is owing to a mere deception: for tho the eye con|&s;iders it as &s;tanding in the plain; it &s;tands in fact upon a hill; and the elevation of the ground being lo&s;t in the di&s;tance, all it's height is added to the church. The whole country between Newark, and Lincoln is highly cul|tivated; and is famous for a breed of large &s;heep, and heavy hor&s;es, peculiar to it&s;elf.&mdash; A little after you pa&s;s Tuxford, you &s;ee the deception in the &s;ituation of Lincoln-cathe|dral. It appears there plainly to &s;tand at the point of a long ridge of elevated land, ri&s;ing above the flat country.</P>
<P>In this neighbourhood lie a clu&s;ter of great hou&s;es. Thore&s;by belongs to the celebrated
<PB N="18" REF="36">
duche&s;s of King&s;ton. We rode through the park, which has no advantages of &s;ituation. The hou&s;e we found &s;hut up by the duche&s;s's order.</P>
<P>Welbeck, the duke of Portland's &s;eat, we did not &s;ee. It lay &s;ome miles out of the road.</P>
<P>Clumber-park, the &s;eat of the duke of Newca&s;tle, di&s;appointed us. We expected an old magnificent hou&s;e, a park adorned with oaks, that had &s;een a fourth or a fifth generation of their noble owners; and other appendages of ancient grandeur. But every thing is new: the hou&s;e is ju&s;t built, the woods ju&s;t planted; and the walks ju&s;t planned. Clumber-park will hardly be worth a tra|veller's notice before the next century.</P>
<P>A few miles farther lies Work&s;op. This hou&s;e is a &s;ingular in&s;tance of the &s;pirit, per&s;everance, and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, of it's pro|prietor, the duke of Norfolk. It had belonged formerly to the earls of Shrew&s;bury, and was gone much into decay. But the duke liking the &s;ituation; and conceiving it to be a good centre-hou&s;e to his great e&s;tates in the&s;e parts, re&s;olved to re&s;tore it to it's ancient &s;plendor. He was now in years; but for the advan|tage of his heir, the honourable Mr. Edward
<PB N="19" REF="37">
Howard, he engaged in the work, and having fitted it up in a very noble manner at the expence of thirty thou&s;and pounds, he was ju&s;t preparing to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it: when on the 22d of October 1761, a fire left care|le&s;&s;ly in the library, caught hold of the flooring of the apartment, and communi|cating it&s;elf with great rapidity to the other chambers, the whole edifice and all it's valuable furniture, pictures, and books were burnt to the ground. The lo&s;s was e&s;timated at an hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Such a cata&s;trophe, one &s;hould have ima|gined, might have checked the duke's farther de&s;igns in building: but it only rou&s;ed him. Almo&s;t before the a&s;hes of the old hou&s;e were cold, he engaged again in building a new one; and taking his young heir in his hand, he laid the foundation &s;tone of a mo&s;t magnificent pile on the 25th of March 1763. It was to con&s;i&s;t of a centre, and two wings. With this work he went on &s;o rapidly, that the centre part, as it now &s;tands, which is it&s;elf a complete palace, extending three hun|dred feet, was fini&s;hed in the year 1765. At that time Mr. Edward Howard dying, the

<P>The hou&s;e &s;tands in the mid&s;t of an exten|&s;ive park; but we &s;aw nothing, that tempted us to take more than a cur&s;ory view of it. The approach &s;eemed ea&s;y, and beautiful.</P>
<P>A few miles from Work&s;op, on the bor|ders of York&s;hire, lies A&s;ton; where Mr. Ma&s;on, with a genero&s;ity rather &s;ingular, has built at his own expence one of the mo&s;t comfortable, and elegant par&s;onage-hou&s;es in England. The old hou&s;e, which is &s;hrouded with trees, is converted into offices; while the new hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ts intirely of excellent apartments. In this &s;weet retreat we &s;pent a day or two, and from thence made an ex|cur&s;ion to Roche-abbey, a beautiful &s;cene in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the earl of Scarborough.</P>

<P>ROCHE-ABBEY &s;tands in the centre of three vallies; each of which is about a mile in length; but otherwi&s;e their dimen|&s;ions, as well as forms are different. One is open, another is clo&s;e; and a third &s;till clo&s;er, and rocky. All of them are woody, and each is adorned with it's little &s;tream.</P>
<P>A very &s;mall part of the abbey remains; two fragments only of the tran&s;ept of the great church. The architecture is rather of a mixed kind; but in general the Gothic prevails.</P>
<P>The&s;e ruins and the &s;cenery around them were in the roughe&s;t &s;tate, when Mr. Brown was employed to adorn them. He is now at work; and has nearly half compleated his intention. This is the fir&s;t &s;ubject of the kind he has attempted. Many a modern palace he has adorned, and beautified: but
<PB N="22" REF="40">
a ruin pre&s;ented a new idea; which I doubt, whether he has &s;ufficiently con&s;idered. He has fini&s;hed one of the vallies, which looks towards Laughton &s;pire: he has floated it with a lake, and formed it into a very beautiful &s;cene. But I fear it is too magnificent, and too artificial an appendage, to be in uni&s;on with the ruins of an abbey. An abbey, it is true, may &s;tand by the &s;ide of a lake; and it is po&s;&s;ible, that <HI>this</HI> lake may, in &s;ome future time, become it's &s;ituation; when the marks of the &s;pade, and the pick-ax are removed&mdash; when it's o&s;iers flouri&s;h; and it's naked banks become fringed, and covered with wood. In a word, when the lake it&s;elf is improved by time, it may &s;uit the ruin, which &s;tands upon it's banks. At pre&s;ent, the lake, and ruin are totally at variance.&mdash;The &s;pire, which ter|minates this view, de&s;erves particular notice, as a very beautiful piece of Gothic architecture, tho the ornament only of a country church. It is al&s;o one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive land marks in England; and may, in &s;ome directions, be &s;een at the di&s;tance of fifty miles.</P>
<P>Mr. Brown is now at work in the centre part of the three vallies, near the ruin it&s;elf. He has already removed all the heaps of rub|bi&s;h,
<PB N="23" REF="41">
which lay around; &s;ome of which were very <HI>ornamental;</HI> and very <HI>u&s;eful</HI> al&s;o, in uniting the two parts of the ruin. They give &s;omething too of more con&s;equence to the <HI>whole,</HI> by di&s;covering the ve&s;tiges of what once exi&s;ted. Many of the&s;e &s;cattered appendages al&s;o, through length of time, having been co|vered with earth, and adorned with wild bru&s;h-wood, had ri&s;en up to the windows, and united the <HI>ruin to the &s;oil,</HI> on which it &s;tood.&mdash;All this is removed: a level is taken, and the ruin &s;tands now on a neat bowling-green, like a hou&s;e ju&s;t built, and without any kind of <HI>connection</HI> with the ground it &s;tands on. There is certainly little judgment &s;hewn in this mode of improvement. I do not mean to place Mr. Brown's works at Roche-abbey, and tho&s;e of a late improver of Fountain's-abbey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See ob&s;ervations on the mountains and lakes of Cum|berland, &amp;c. v. II. p. 183.</NOTE> in the &s;ame light. At Fountain's-abbey every thing was done with a childi&s;h hand. Here, every thing is manly, and in it's way ma&s;terly. The <HI>character</HI> only of the &s;cene is mi&s;taken. If Mr. Brown
<PB N="24" REF="42">
&s;hould proceed a &s;tep farther&mdash;pull down the ruin, and build an elegant man&s;ion, every thing would then be right, and in it's pro|per place. But in a <HI>ruin</HI> the reigning ideas are <HI>&s;olitude, neglect,</HI> and <HI>de&s;olation.</HI> The environs of a hou&s;e &s;hould partake of the elegance or grandeur of the man&s;ion they adorn, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> harmony and propriety require it. If there is force in <HI>this</HI> rea&s;on, it &s;urely holds equally true, that a ruin &s;hould be left in a &s;tate of wildne&s;s, and negligence. Har|mony and propriety require one, as much as the other.</P>
<P>Of what improvement then is the &s;cenery of a ruin capable?</P>
<P>Of &s;ome no doubt. Tho we &s;hould not wi&s;h to adorn it with <HI>poli&s;hed nature</HI>&mdash;tho the &s;horn lawn, the flowering &s;hrub, and the embelli&s;hed walk, are alien ideas; yet many things <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> may be removed. <HI>Some part</HI> of the rubbi&s;h, or of the bru&s;hwood may be out of place, and hide what ought to be &s;een. The ground, in many parts, may be altered, but di&s;cretely altered. A path may wind; but not &s;uch grand walks as are here intro|duced, rather for parade, than contemplation; and &s;uch certainly as the convent never knew,
<PB N="25" REF="43">
even in it's highe&s;t &s;tate of pro&s;perity. Trees al&s;o may be planted; and water may be in|troduced. But a &s;ort of negligent air &s;hould run through the whole: and if art &s;hould <HI>always be concealed;</HI> it &s;hould here be <HI>totally hid.</HI> The precept conveyed in tho&s;e beautiful lines, cannot be <HI>too religiou&s;ly</HI> applied to &s;cenes like the&s;e.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; If art</L>
<L>E'er dares to tread; 'tis with un&s;andal'd foot,</L>
<L>Printle&s;s, as if the place were holy ground.</L></Q>
<P>No &s;unk fence, or netted barrier, &s;hould re|&s;train the flock. Let them browze within the very precincts of the ruin. It is a habi|tation for&s;aken of men, and re&s;umed by nature; and tho nature do not require a <HI>&s;lovenly</HI> path to walk in; yet &s;he always wi&s;hes for one with <HI>&s;ome degree of rudene&s;s</HI> about it.</P>
<P>If the man&s;ion-hou&s;e &s;tand near the ruins you wi&s;h to adorn, the ruins them&s;elves will then become only <HI>appendages.</HI> Neatne&s;s in part <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be introduced. Yet &s;till, even in this ca&s;e, one &s;hould wi&s;h to have the ruins in a &s;eque&s;tered place, le&s;s adorned, than the environs of a man&s;ion ought to be.</P>
<P>There is another &s;pecies of improvement, of which a ruin is &s;u&s;ceptible; but it is of
<PB N="26" REF="44">
the mo&s;t delicate kind. Few ruins are exactly what we could wi&s;h. We generally find a <HI>deficiency,</HI> or a <HI>redundancy,</HI> as far as <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> is concerned. The ruin we now con&s;ider, from the &s;quarene&s;s, and uniformity of its two parts, is heavy, uniform, and di&s;plea&s;ing. The parts are elegant in them&s;elves; but for want of contra&s;t, they form a di&s;agreeable whole. You can &s;ee them to advantage only from particular &s;tands, where one part is thrown behind another in per&s;pective. By the &s;mall alteration therefore of making either part <HI>lower</HI> or <HI>higher,</HI> you might improve the compo&s;ition: but the operation would be exceedingly nice. No picture&s;que hand dur&s;t <HI>take away.</HI> But an addition might be made without much hazard; becau&s;e what you <HI>add,</HI> you may like|wi&s;e <HI>remove.</HI> The <HI>beauty of the compo&s;ition,</HI> and the <HI>harmony of the architecture</HI> would be the two chief points to be attended to. The ruins of Roche-abbey might receive great beauty from the fragment of a tower. If this or any other prominent addition could happily be made, it would certainly have a good effect: but it would require great knowledge both of the ruin, and it's deficient appendages, to make it with propriety, and veri&s;imilitude.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="45">Of the three vallies, which center in the&s;e ruins, I have mentioned one only, which Mr. Brown has yet improved. Both the others are beautiful: but one of them, which is a &s;ort of rocky cha&s;m, is <HI>in it's natural &s;tate</HI> &s;o plea&s;ing; that I &s;hould fear, every touch of art would be injurious.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the&s;e remarks on the im|provement of ruins, with a few beautiful <HI>images of de&s;olation,</HI> which the prophet I&s;aiah introduces in &s;ubjects of this kind. <HI>His</HI> ruins have their proper accompaniments.

when this valley was the retreat of &s;olitude, all the&s;e hills were covered with wood; which formed delicious bowers in various parts, and de&s;cending in clumps around the abbey, &s;kreened it from inclement bla&s;ts. Now the&s;e beautiful &s;kreens are removed: the abbey &s;tands expo&s;ed; and the ancient limits of the woods are &s;carce marked by a few &s;cattered trees. All the interval is divided into portions, and furrowed by the plough.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the valley, near the &s;outhern bank of the river, &s;tand the ruins of the abbey; a very large proportion of which is &s;till left. Almo&s;t the whole body of the great church remains, which &s;eems to want little, except the roof. The tower is &s;till intire; and the cro&s;s aile. A variety of ruined buildings are &s;cattered round, the u&s;es of which are gue&s;&s;ed at, rather than a&s;cer|tained. Some of them are in &s;ufficient repair to an&s;wer modern purpo&s;es. On the &s;outh are the traces of a beautiful Gothic cloi&s;ter.</P>
<P>With regard however to the &s;tile in general of the abbey of Kirk&s;tall, and it's picture&s;que form, but little can be &s;aid. It is compo&s;ed of a &s;ort of mixed architecture. Here and there you &s;ee a piece of Gothic has been
<PB N="31" REF="48">
added; but in the greater part the Saxon heavine&s;s prevails. The pillars in the nave are ma&s;&s;y, and void of grace. The form too of the ruin is unplea&s;ing. It is deba&s;ed by the commonne&s;s of it. You have merely the &s;hell of an old church. It is too perfect al&s;o. We rather wi&s;h for that degree of dilapidation, which gives conjecture room to wander; and the imagination &s;ome little &s;cope. A certain degree of ob&s;curity adds dignity to an object.</P>
<P>The precincts of the abbey were formerly &s;urrounded by a wall, (as abbeys generally were) the ve&s;tiges of which may &s;till be traced. The circumference of the whole is about a mile, drawn round in a &s;emicircular form; the river compleating the boundary on the &s;outh. In one part of this boundary, north|we&s;t of the abbey, &s;tands a gate, which &s;eems to have been the grand entrance. It is yet a con&s;iderable pile, and makes an excellent farm-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As we were examining the ruins, our guide pointed to a very narrow winding &s;tair-ca&s;e at the we&s;t end of the church, which led formerly to the roof. Into this &s;tair-ca&s;e, he told us, a cow, pu&s;hing her&s;elf probably at fir&s;t,
<PB N="32" REF="49">
to avoid the flies, at length gained the top; and was di&s;covered by her owner, looking through the broken arch of a window, which he &s;hewed us, where a narrow &s;helf had formerly &s;upported the roof. The man had no expectation of &s;eeing his bea&s;t again at the bottom without broken bones; but &s;uch was her dexterity, that with a very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he got down by the &s;ame narrow pa&s;&s;age, by which &s;he had a&s;cended.&mdash;As this &s;tory belongs to the natural hi&s;tory of the place, I have recorded it: but rather, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, with a view to di&s;credit it, than to authen|ticate. There are &s;o many &s;tories told of cows climbing up narrow &s;tair-ca&s;es, among ruins, that they de&s;troy each other. One is told at Norwich; and I remember, at the abbey of Lanerco&s;t in Cumberland, a cow not only got up a narrow &s;tair-ca&s;e, but rang a bell at an un&s;ea&s;onable hour, by which &s;he alarmed the whole neighbourhood. Why this unwieldy animal is fixed on for the&s;e feats of activity, I can a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on, but that it makes the &s;tory more wonderful.</P>

<P>AT Longtown, which is &s;even miles be|yond Carli&s;le, we cro&s;&s;ed the E&s;k; and &s;oon entered Scotland, taking the Langham road to Edinburgh. The E&s;k is properly a Scotti&s;h river, flowing along a &s;mall part only of the Engli&s;h border; but along a con|&s;iderable part of the Edinburg road. In a few miles it is joined by the Liddel, and at the confluence of the&s;e &s;treams a &s;ort of pro|montory is formed, on which &s;tand the ruins of a fort, called in the country the <HI>Strength of Liddel.</HI> It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a Roman &s;tation, and was once the curb of the country.

<P>In after times, when other oppre&s;&s;ors &s;ucceeded tho&s;e of Rome, prevailing factions
<PB N="36" REF="53">
of Picts, and Britons, Scotts and Engli&s;h, had it alternately in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. As con|temptible as it now appears, it was twice be&s;ieged by royal armies; once under Edward the third of England; and again under David the &s;econd of Scotland. It is &s;hocking to huma|nity that few of the&s;e places can be found, without &s;ome horrid tale annexed to them. When David took the place, he condemned the governor to death. That might be ju&s;tice: but it could only be through the dictates of vengeance that he ordered his two &s;ons to be butchered before his eyes, as he was led to execution. And yet David, according to Buchanan, was a prince <HI>in omni virtutum genere, ac in primis clementia, memorabilis.</HI></P>
<P>In later ages this country wanted a &s;tronger curb, then &s;uch a fortre&s;s as the <HI>Strength of Liddel</HI> could impo&s;e. It was an almo&s;t &s;in|gular in&s;tance, in the hi&s;tory of civil &s;ociety, that a paltry di&s;trict &s;hould continue in an independent &s;tate; between two powerful kingdoms; inhabited by clans of banditti, alike obnoxious to each, and not to be &s;ub|dued by the police of both. Their captains lived in fortified ca&s;tles; bad defiance to the power of a &s;heriff, and feared only the attack
<PB N="37" REF="54">
of regular troops. The importance of the&s;e border-chiefs is well de&s;cribed in an old ballad, which does honour to Johnny Arm&s;trong, who was in his day one of the mo&s;t celebrated of them. This hero, having been &s;ent for, in the year 1528, by James the fifth (who was then upon a progre&s;s to the borders,) came unexpectedly into the royal pre&s;ence, magni|ficently apparelled, and attended by a numerous train of followers. The poet introduces him in this dignified manner:
<Q><L>When Johnny came before the king,</L>
<L>With his eight&s;core men &s;o gallant to &s;ee;</L>
<L>The king he moved his bonnet to him,</L>
<L>For he thought he'd been a king as well as he.</L></Q>
Numbers of the lower members of this plun|dering community were executed every year, both in England and Scotland; but no depopulation en&s;ued. A livelihood from other men's labours, and an a&s;ylum from the penal laws, were powerful incentives to the idle and profligate of both kingdoms; and fully repaired &s;uch ca&s;ual depredations, as were annually made by the hand of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In Edward the &s;ixth's time, about the year 1552, the affair of the <HI>debatable land,</HI> as this coun|try was called, &s;eems to have been taken into

&s;erious con&s;ideration. The plan was to divide it into two equal parts, that each kingdom might introduce order into it's re&s;pective di|vi&s;ion. Commi&s;&s;ioners for this purpo&s;e were appointed, and a letter is &s;till pre&s;erved, in which the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners inform the council, that <HI>there be two &s;mall brooks in the debatable, the one called Hawburn, the other Woodhou&s;eburn, whereof the former falleth into the river Sark, and the other into the river E&s;k; and they wi&s;h the divi&s;ion might be made from the mouth of one of the&s;e brooks to that of the other</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hayne's &s;tate papers. p. 120.</NOTE>. This divi&s;ion they explain by a plan &s;ent along with their letter, <HI>having,</HI> they &s;ay, <HI>three lines drawn acro&s;s the debatable. The fir&s;t towards the &s;ea-&s;ide, expre&s;&s;eth the divi&s;ion, which the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners offered: the &s;econd, being the middle line, and named by us</HI> STELLATA LINEA, <HI>repre&s;enteth the divi&s;ion, whereof we now write; and the third is that, which our commi&s;&s;ioners offered to the Scotts.</HI> The <HI>&s;tellata linea</HI> &s;eems to have been &s;ome abatement of what had been offered to the Scotts; but the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;till think,
<PB N="39" REF="56">
<HI>that rather than leave the matter undone, they &s;hould relent &s;omewhat even of the &s;aid</HI> STEL|LATA LINEA, <HI>but &s;o that the two hou&s;es of &s;tone (the one being Sandy Arm&s;trong's, the other Thomas Greme's) may be within the limits of the Engli&s;h debatable.</HI> How far this good work proceeded, does not appear; it is certain however, that it produced no effect; for throughout the reign of Elizabeth, we meet with numberle&s;s in&s;tances of the continuance of the&s;e border depredations. Sufficient employment perhaps could not be found for the&s;e borderers, in the infancy of arts and tillage which certainly meliorate the manners of a &s;avage people; and to a certain period at lea&s;t, till luxury is introdu|ced, &s;upply the place of penal laws.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>debatable land,</HI> we were often amu&s;ed with the &s;weet vallies of the E&s;k, which make the road generally plea&s;ant, if not intere&s;ting. Mo&s;t of the&s;e vallies are well wooded; and the trees, tho far from what may be denominated <HI>timber,</HI> are yet &s;ufficient to beautify the &s;cene.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="57">In one of the&s;e retreats &s;tands Gilnoc-hall, the ancient ca&s;tle of Johnny Arm&s;trong.</P>
<P>We met with many of the&s;e little fortre&s;&s;es in different parts of the borders. They are commonly built in the form of &s;quare towers. The walls are thick: the apertures for light &s;mall. They are divided generally into three or four &s;tories, each containing only one apartment. The lowe&s;t was the receptacle for cattle, which were driven into it in time of alarm. The family occupied the upper &s;tories. As the&s;e towers were chiefly meant as places of &s;ecurity again&s;t the banditti of the country, the garri&s;on had &s;eldom more than the &s;iege of an hour or two to &s;u&s;tain. They could bear therefore crouding together; and were not anxious about their magazines. If they were attacked by any of the neigh|bouring garri&s;ons, they could make no defence.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Cary, earl of Monmouth, gives us an account, in his memoirs, written in the time of Elizabeth, of his manner of attacking one of the&s;e old towers. He was warden of the we&s;tern march; and lay with his garri&s;on at Carli&s;le; where hearing of an outrageous act committed by &s;ome Scotts, he pur&s;ued them with twenty hor&s;e. When he came
<PB N="41" REF="58">
up with them, he found they had taken refuge in a tower. In this exigence his hor&s;e was of little u&s;e, except to prevent an e&s;cape. He &s;ent therefore to Carli&s;le for a few foot, and <HI>pre&s;ently &s;et them at work to get up to the top of the tower, and to uncover the roof, and then &s;ome twenty of them to fall down together; and by that means to win the tower. The Scotts &s;eeing their pre&s;ent danger, offered to parley; and opening the iron gate, yielded them&s;elves to mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Gilnoc-hall is probably what the commi&s;|&s;ioners call the <HI>hou&s;e of &s;tone of Sandy Arm&s;trong.</HI> It has &s;till a ca&s;tle-like form: but it's &s;itu|ation, which is under a woody hill, is rather that of an abbey, than of a ca&s;tle. As it had nothing however to do with the defence of the country; but only to take care of it&s;elf, a &s;eque&s;tered &s;ituation might &s;uit it be&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the E&s;k, we met with many rivu|lets; each of which in it's turn, hath run purple to the &s;ea, with the blood of our ance&s;tors. If the borders were &s;ubject to con&s;tant ravages in the time of peace, we may well &s;uppo&s;e what they were in time of
<PB N="42" REF="59">
war. The borderers were expert in all the arts of rapine, and plundering; and having on both &s;ides a national antipathy, wanted only a pretence to indulge it. The ravages that were committed, when open ho&s;tility commenced between the two kingdoms, by the regular garri&s;ons of both, were &s;o ruinous, and &s;o frequent, that we are a&s;toni&s;hed how countries &s;o often de&s;olated, could be worth plundering.</P>
<P>Among Haynes's &s;tate papers, we have the hi&s;tory of one of the&s;e irregular cam|paigns, in the time of Henry the eighth, under the title of <HI>Exploits done upon the Scotts in the year</HI> 1544. The fir&s;t <HI>exploit was done</HI> on the 2d of July, and the la&s;t on the 17th of November. Between the&s;e two dates (which include little more than four months) is contained an account of ninety-&s;even dif|ferent inroads into the borders of Scotland; which no doubt were repaid in kind by the Scotts; tho probably not in &s;o full a mea&s;ure. In each of the&s;e details the actors are &s;pecified, the time, the &s;cene, the mi&s;chief done, and the booty obtained.

<P>I need not multiply extracts from this horrid catalogue, in which the pillage, ruin, and &s;laughter of thou&s;ands of individuals (contri|buting nothing to the &s;um of the war) are related with as much indifference, as the bringing in of a harve&s;t.

<P>WE travelled along the banks of the E&s;k many miles; and found &s;everal beautiful &s;cenes. Near Langham particularly, it winds through groves, which diver&s;ify the road; and it's bed is finely channelled with rock.</P>
<P>The banks of the Tiviot &s;oon after received us; and conducted us into a new country. On the borders of the E&s;k our views had been in general confined within contracted vallies. But now the country began to ex|pand; and a&s;&s;umed features intirely different. The Tiviot takes it's cour&s;e through wide vallies of &s;mooth extended pa&s;turage, &s;loping down to it in all directions; and in general forming beautiful lines; tho otherwi&s;e void of all tho&s;e circum&s;tances, and that variety
<PB N="48" REF="64">
of objects, particularly of wood, which give beauty to land&s;cape. In &s;ome parts the&s;e vallies al&s;o are contracted; but in a different manner from tho&s;e of the E&s;k. The &s;ame breadth of feature is &s;till pre&s;erved, which we had in the more open parts, only it is here brought nearer the eye. Tho the lofty &s;kreens ru&s;h down precipitately to the river, and contract the vallies, you &s;ee plainly they are the parts of a large-featured country; and in a &s;tile of land&s;cape very different from tho&s;e little irriguous vallies which we had left.</P>
<P>The downy &s;ides of all the&s;e vallies are covered with &s;heep, which often appear to hang upon immen&s;e green walls. So &s;teep is the de&s;cent in &s;ome parts, that the eye, from the bottom, &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hes the &s;lope from a perpendicular. Several of the&s;e mountainous &s;lopes (for &s;ome of them are very lofty) are finely tinted with mo&s;&s;es of different hues, which give them a very rich &s;urface. This however is the garb only, which nature wears at this &s;ea&s;on of the year. She has a variety of dre&s;&s;es for all &s;ea&s;ons; and all &s;o becoming, that when &s;he depo&s;its one, and a&s;&s;umes ano|ther,

&s;he is always adorned with beauties peculiar to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Hawick has a romantic &s;ituation among rocks, &s;ounding rivers, cataracts, and bridges; all of which are very picture&s;que. When we meet with objects of this kind (the re&s;ult of nature, and chance,) what contempt do they throw upon the laboured works of art? There is more picture&s;que beauty in the old bridge at Hawick, than in the mo&s;t elegant piece of new-made river &s;cenery. I mean not to a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch an object would &s;uit a piece of improved ground. It would there be out of place. All I mean, is, that the picture&s;que eye has that kind of fa&s;tidiou&s;ne&s;s about it, that it is &s;eldom plea&s;ed with any artificial attempts to plea&s;e. It mu&s;t find it's own beauties; and often fixes, as here, on &s;ome accidental, rough object, which the common eye would pa&s;s unnoticed.</P>
<P>As we proceeded to Selkirk, we found the road on the north of Hawick a perfect contra&s;t to what we had pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;outh. There
<PB N="50" REF="67">
we were carried along the vallies, and looked up to the hills. Here we were carried along the hills, and looked down upon the vallies. Here too, in general, the mountains formed beautiful lines; but as in hi&s;tory-painting, figures without drapery, and other appendages, make but an indifferent group; &s;o in &s;cenery, naked mountains form poor compo&s;ition. They require the drapery of a little wood to break the &s;implicity of their &s;hapes, to produce contra&s;ts, to connect one part with another; and to give that richne&s;s in land&s;cape, which is one of it's greate&s;t ornaments. We are told indeed, that this was formerly a very woody country&mdash;that it was called the <HI>fore&s;t of Selkirk;</HI> and extended over great part of the &s;outhern counties of Scotland. And yet if this information did not depend on good hi&s;torical authority, we might be led to di&s;pute it. For people are &s;eldom at the trouble of felling a fore&s;t, unle&s;s they want either the timber, or the ground it &s;tands on; neither of which, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;eems to have been wanted.</P>
<P>The&s;e mountains however, unadorned as they appear, are by no means void of beauty. We had &s;everal plea&s;ing views along the val|lies;
<PB REF="68">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="51" REF="69">
particularly one towards Sunderland hall, where the river Atric plays round the pro|montories of &s;everal &s;weeping mountains, which guide it's cour&s;e.</P>
<P>A little beyond the Atric we meet the Tweed; which is here a river of no great con&s;equence; but it's deficiency in <HI>grandeur,</HI> is made up in <HI>beauty.</HI> We travelled along it's banks about a mile; and in that &s;hort &s;pace were entertained with two or three plea&s;ing views; the mo&s;t &s;triking of which were at Yar, and Ferney.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e at Yar, which belongs to the duke of Buccleugh, is no object; nor is the river vi&s;ible in this view; but the road winds beautifully to a bridge, beyond which the mountains make agreeable inter&s;ections.</P>
<P>At Ferney we had a grand &s;cene of moun|tain-per&s;pective. It is not often that the&s;e elevated bodies coincide with the rules of beauty, and compo&s;ition&mdash;le&s;s often indeed than any other mode of land&s;cape. In a level country, the awkwardne&s;s of a line is hid. But the mountain rearing it's opakene&s;s again&s;t the &s;ky, &s;hews every fault both in it's deli|neation, and combination with great exactne&s;s. The&s;e mountains however had few faults to

&s;hew. They were both well-formed, and well connected; and &s;hewed al&s;o in great perfection the beauties of gradation&mdash;gradation in form&mdash;gradation in light&mdash;and gradation in colour. With the&s;e adjuncts, which are among the mo&s;t beautiful in land&s;cape, the exhibition could not but be plea&s;ing. One of the neare&s;t of the&s;e mountains was inriched, when we &s;aw it, with a deep purple tint; which did not &s;eem the production of any vegetable &s;ub&s;tance, but rather &s;ome enamelled mineral &s;tain.</P>
<P>It is no little recommendation of the rivers we met with here, that almo&s;t every one of them is the &s;ubject of &s;ome plea&s;ing Scotch ditty; which the &s;cene rai&s;es to the memory of tho&s;e, who are ver&s;ed in the lyrics of the country. The elegant &s;implicity of the ver&s;e, and the &s;oothing melody of the mu&s;ic, in almo&s;t all the Scotch &s;ongs, is univer&s;ally acknowledged. <HI>Tweed-&s;ide,</HI> and <HI>Atric's banks,</HI> are not among the lea&s;t plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Beyond the Tweed the country becomes again mountainous, wild and uncultivated; in which &s;tate it continues till within thirteen or fourteen miles of Edinburgh. A little beyond Middleton, before we de&s;cended the
<PB N="53" REF="71">
higher grounds into the plain, we had a view from the brow of the hill, of the &s;ituation of that capital.</P>
<P>The plain is bounded by the Pentland hills; which in them&s;elves are not magnificent; but appeared con&s;iderably &s;o to us through the medium of a light mi&s;t, which began to over-&s;pread the di&s;tance. Deceptions of this kind are very common in mountainous coun|tries. Under &s;uch a circum&s;tance I have often conceived my&s;elf about to a&s;cend &s;ome &s;tupen|dous mountain, which dwindled, on a nearer approach, into a mere hill. On the right of the Pentland hills ari&s;es Arthur's &s;eat; a rock, which hangs over Edinburgh, of peculiar appearance; romantic, but not picture&s;que. It continues long the &s;triking feature of the view; neither the ca&s;tle, nor any part of the town appearing for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>As we approach nearer; the environs of Edinburgh become more di&s;tinct. We get a view of the Forth; and &s;ee the grounds about Mu&s;&s;elborough and Dalkeith, on the &s;outhern &s;ide of it; and the mountains of Fife&s;hire on the northern.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="72">About &s;ix or &s;even miles on this &s;ide or Edinburgh we turned a little out of the way to vi&s;it Dalkeith hou&s;e; which belongs to the duke of Buccleugh. It &s;tands on a knoll overlooking a &s;mall river. The knoll is probably in part artificial; for an awkward &s;quare hollow hard by indicates that the knoll has been dug out of it. Beyond the river are woods; and a picture&s;que view of the town and church of Dalkeith. But the hou&s;e fronts the other way, where it is not only confined, but the ground ri&s;es <HI>from it.</HI> It might have &s;tood with great advantage, if it had been carried two or three hundred yards farther from the river; and it's front turned towards it. A fine lawn would then have de&s;cended from it, bounded by the river, and the woods. We often &s;ee a bad &s;ituation cho&s;en: but we &s;eldom &s;ee a good one &s;o narrowly mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal plea&s;ing pictures in Dalkeith-hou&s;e; one of the mo&s;t &s;triking, is a land&s;cape by Vernet, in Salvator's &s;tyle. It is a rocky &s;cene through which a torrent ru&s;hes: the foaming violence of the water is well expre&s;&s;ed. I have not often met with a picture of this fa&s;hionable ma&s;ter, which I
<PB N="55" REF="73">
liked better. And yet it is not entirely free from the flutter of a French arti&s;t.</P>
<P>Here, and in almo&s;t all the great hou&s;es of Scotland, we have pictures of queen Mary; but their authenticity is often doubted from the circum&s;tance of her hair. In one it is auburn, in another black, and in another yellow. Notwith&s;tanding however this dif|ference, it is very po&s;&s;ible, that all the&s;e pictures may be genuine. We have a letter pre&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hayne's &s;tate papers p. 511.</NOTE>, from Mr. White, a &s;ervant of queen Elizabeth, to Sir William Cecil, in which he mentions his having &s;een queen Mary at Tutbury ca&s;tle. "<HI>She is a goodly per&s;onage,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>hath an alluring grace, a pretty Scotti&s;h &s;peech, a &s;earching wit, and great mildne&s;s. Her hair of it&s;elf is black; but Mr. Knolls told me, that &s;he wears hair of &s;undry colours.</HI>"</P>
<P>This hou&s;e was formerly, like mo&s;t of the great hou&s;es in Scotland, built in the form of a ca&s;tle. It belonged then to the noble family of Douglas; and was once the gloomy retreat of a celebrated chief of that name&mdash;the earl of Morton; who was regent of the kingdom
<PB N="56" REF="74">
<HI>nominally</HI> under James; but <HI>really</HI> under Elizabeth. That artful prince&s;s, having impri&s;oned Mary, conducted the affairs of Scotland, through this mini&s;ter, as &s;he plea&s;ed. Elizabeth was not nice in the choice of her in&s;truments. Moral failings, in men of abilities, were no blemi&s;hes. Morton's cha|racter is marked in hi&s;tory with tho&s;e vices which unbounded ambition commonly ingrafts upon the <HI>fiercer pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> cruelty, and revenge; to which we may add an in&s;atiable avarice. Popular odium at length overpowered him, and he found it nece&s;&s;ary to retire from public life. This ca&s;tle was the &s;cene of his retreat; where he wi&s;hed the world to believe, he was &s;eque&s;tered from all earthly concerns. But the terror he had impre&s;&s;ed through the country during his power was &s;uch, that the common people &s;till dreaded him even in re|tirement. In pa&s;&s;ing towards Dalkeith, they generally made a circuit round the ca&s;tle, which they dur&s;t not approach, calling it, the lion's den. While he was thus &s;uppo&s;ed to be employed in making his parterres, and forming his terraces, he was planning a &s;cheme for the revival of his power. It &s;uddenly took effect, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all Scotland.
<PB N="57" REF="75">
But it was of &s;hort continuance. In little more than two years, he was obliged to retreat again from public affairs; and ended his life on a Scaffold.</P>

<P>AS we approached Edinburgh from Dal|keith, the country around is woody, and cultivated; but it is cultivated in the Numidian fa&s;hion; <HI>praeter oppido propinqua, alia omnia va&s;ta, atque inculta</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sal. Bell. Jug.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A nearer approach did not give us a more plea&s;ing idea of the environs of Edinburgh. We had always heard it repre&s;ented as one of the mo&s;t picture&s;que towns in Britain; but people often con&s;ider <HI>romantic</HI> and <HI>picture&s;que,</HI> as &s;ynonymous. Arthur's &s;eat which is &s;till the principal object, appears &s;till as odd, mi&s;hapen, and uncouth as before. It gave us the idea of a cap of maintenance in heral|dry; and a view with &s;uch a &s;taring feature in it, can no more be picture&s;que, than a face with a bulbous no&s;e can be beautiful. The
<PB N="60" REF="78">
town and ca&s;tle indeed on the left, make &s;ome amends, and are happily introduced. In front al&s;o, between the eye and Arthur's &s;eat, &s;tands an old ca&s;tle-like building, called Craigmiller, which has a good effect. It is celebrated for being the &s;cene, where the unfortunate Mary, repenting her ra&s;h match with Darnley, would often retire from the public eye, and indulge her melancholy in private. Here too her imagination might draw a parallel between the brutal manners of that prince, and tho&s;e of the all-ob&s;equious Bothwell, for whom her pa&s;&s;ion at this time is &s;aid to have taken root.</P>
<P>But the &s;ituation of Edinburgh, tho it can|not be called picture&s;que, is very peculiar. The ca&s;tle &s;tands &s;o loftily, that it was called by the Romans, the <HI>alatum ca&s;trum,</HI> or the winged ca&s;tle, as if it &s;tood in the air. The rock is perpendicular on every &s;ide, but the ca&s;t; from whence it de&s;cends gently, in a ridge, through the &s;pace of a mile and a half, into the plain below. On this ridge, which contains room only for one ample &s;treet, the town is built. From this form it is ea&s;y to conceive, the different appearances, which
<PB N="61" REF="79">
Edinburgh pre&s;ents, on going round it. As you approach from the &s;outh, it appears like a grand city of noble extent. As you move to the right, it's &s;ize gradually dimini&s;hes. But when you view it from the Mu&s;&s;elborough road, which is in a direction due ea&s;t, the &s;treet is gone; and the hou&s;es are all crouded together, as if they had retreated under the walls of the ca&s;tle. And yet the appearance of the town, and ca&s;tle thus united by per|&s;pective into one va&s;t object, is extremely grand. If they had been &s;een before from no other &s;ituation; and the ground plot unknown, the imagination would have been totally lo&s;t in developing &s;o &s;trange a production of art. Formerly, the whole town was &s;urrounded by water; from which the French gave it the name of <HI>L'i&s;leburgh.</HI> But now the water is entirely drained off.</P>
<P>The antiquity of Edinburgh cannot be traced: but it's hi&s;tory ea&s;ily may. No times, but tho&s;e of anarchy, and ari&s;tocratic confu|&s;ion, could have fixed on &s;uch a &s;ituation for a capital&mdash;a &s;ituation &s;o extremely inconve|nient, that the town would long ago have left the craggy ridge it occupies, and have de|&s;cended into the plain below, which lies
<PB N="62" REF="80">
perfectly commodious to receive it; if the magi&s;trates, who&s;e intere&s;t it is to keep it where it &s;tands, had not forcibly prohibited it's removal; notwith&s;tanding which it is, in one part &s;preading into a noble city, con|&s;tructed on modern rules of &s;ymmetry and convenience.&mdash;It was not however till late in the Scotti&s;h annals, that Edinburgh be|came the &s;eat of empire. A &s;ituation, &s;outh of the Forth, was thought too much expo&s;ed to Engli&s;h inroads: and tho it has now been long con&s;idered as the capital of Scotland, it was never, except occa&s;ionally, the re&s;idence of the Scotti&s;h kings. Perth had that honour anciently; and Sterling in more modern times.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle is almo&s;t the only object of picture&s;que curio&s;ity in Edinburgh. They, who go to &s;ee it, are commonly &s;atisfied with being carried <HI>into</HI> it; where they find a num|ber of patched, incoherent buildings without any beauty. Scarce any thing in it de&s;erves the lea&s;t attention; except the views from the batteries, which are very amu&s;ing; par|ticularly tho&s;e over the Forth.&mdash;But he who would &s;ee Edinburgh-ca&s;tle in perfection, mu&s;t go to the bottom of the rock, it &s;tands on, and walk round it. In this view the
<PB REF="81">
<FIGURE>

<PB N="63" REF="82">
whole appears a very &s;tupendous fabric. The rock, which is in it&s;elf an amazing pile, is in many parts nobly broken; and tho, in it's whole immen&s;ity, it is too large an object for a picture, unle&s;s at a proper di&s;tance; yet many of it's craggy corners, with their watch-towers and other appendages, are very picture&s;que.</P>
<P>One part is particularly plea&s;ing, in which the bridge over the North-loch (which is a noble piece of architecture) is introduced in the di&s;tance like a Roman aquaduct.</P>
<P>Holy-rood hou&s;e is a grand palace, occu|pying a large &s;quare. The front con&s;i&s;ting of a round tower on each &s;ide of the gate, is of ancient architecture. The body of the edifice was con&s;tructed by Sir William Bruce, &s;ince the Grecian orders were introduced. The gallery is a noble room. It is a hundred and forty-&s;even feet long, and twenty-nine broad; and has that dark &s;olemn ap|pearance, in which grandeur and dignity &s;o much con&s;i&s;t. It is adorned with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of an hundred and eleven kings from Fergus the fir&s;t to James the &s;eventh;&mdash;a &s;eries which
<PB N="64" REF="83">
carries the Scotti&s;h monarchy, in the ordinary &s;cale of calculation, not indeed quite to the times of Noah, but above two thirds of the way. Be the authenticity of the&s;e princes however what it may, as they are all painted by one hand (which has been no de&s;picable one) and in a dark &s;tyle, &s;uited to the &s;olemnity of the place, they have all together a uni|form, and plea&s;ing effect. In this palace we were &s;hewn the blood of David Rizio&mdash;the chamber where the queen &s;at at &s;upper when he was killed&mdash;the private door, through which Ruthven entered in complete armour; and the room, into which Rizio was dragged, adjoining to that, in which the queen &s;at. Such was the barbarity of tho&s;e times, that the lord high chancellor of Scotland, the guar|dian of it's laws, him&s;elf joined with a band of ruffians in perpetrating this murder.</P>
<P>Holy-rood hou&s;e was formerly an abbey, as well as a royal man&s;ion; and among it's appendages are the ruins of a Gothic chapel, which was once very beautiful. Divine &s;er|vice had cea&s;ed in it, &s;ince the time of the reformation: but it had long continued to be the burial place of &s;ome of the be&s;t families in Scotland: and in honour of this &s;acred tru&s;t,
<PB N="65" REF="84">
it was &s;ome years ago repaired. But the architects employed in the repairs, had very different ideas from tho&s;e, who had been employed in the original &s;tructure. A mo|dern heavy roof was thrown over light, airy Gothic walls: the con&s;equence of which was, it cru&s;hed them. On the night of the 2d of December, 1768, a cra&s;h was heard by the inhabitants of the neighbour|ing di&s;trict; and in the morning, the roof, walls, and monuments were all blended in one confu&s;ed ma&s;s of irretrievable ruin.</P>
<P>This chapel is &s;aid to have been the mo&s;t beautiful &s;pecimen of Gothic architecture in Scotland, except one, which &s;till exi&s;ts, at Ro&s;lin, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh; which, through an unhappy mi&s;take we did not &s;ee. It was built about the year 1440, which was the age of the pure&s;t Gothic; and therefore we could ea&s;ily give credit to what we were told of the beauty of it's con|&s;truction. It's &s;ides are &s;upported by but|tre&s;&s;es, like King's College-chapel, and We&s;t|min&s;ter-abbey; but in a &s;tile &s;till richer than either of tho&s;e &s;tructures.</P>
<P>At Ro&s;lin al&s;o &s;tand the ruins of a ca&s;tle, built on a projecting rock, which overlooks

a deep valley. The whole, we were told, affords a very beautiful &s;cene.</P>
<P>Arthur's &s;eat pre&s;ents an unplea&s;ing view from every &s;tation. Some formal part &s;tares you in the face in every corner of Edin|burgh. You rarely meet even with a pic|ture&s;que fragment. It's great regularity has in part been owing to the &s;treets of London; which were paved from it's bowels. A girdle of quarry running round it, adds to it's for|mality.</P>
<P>This rocky hill was once probably a pic|ture&s;que &s;cene; for it was once, we were informed, covered with wood. But this was then thought &s;o great a nui&s;ance, that, we were told, there is &s;till exi&s;ting an ancient record, from which it appears, that every man, who would take building-timber from Arthur's &s;eat, &s;hould be indulged with the privilege of projecting his hou&s;e over the &s;treet.</P>

<P>FROM Edinburgh we took the Sterling road, along the Forth; which afforded us a great variety of plea&s;ing views.</P>
<P>In one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, the ca&s;tle of Garvy is introduced, &s;tanding near the water-edge, at the point of a promontory, which &s;eems to be formed by the high lands, on the northern &s;ide of the Forth. This how|ever is only it's apparent &s;ituation. In fact it &s;tands upon an i&s;land; the in&s;ularity of which is intirely hid. In this place the Forth becomes a narrow &s;trait of about two miles over; and Garvy-ca&s;tle, which occupies the mid-channel, was intended for it's defence. It commands a view of the whole Forth&mdash;on the we&s;t as far as Sterling&mdash;and on the ea&s;t as far as the i&s;le of May. On the &s;outhern &s;hore of this &s;trait &s;tands Queen's-ferry, from whence the Forth widens again into a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="68" REF="87">
bay on the we&s;t. The whole &s;cenery is indeed very plea&s;ing; and to tho&s;e, who had time to examine it as it de&s;erves, would afford very beautiful views.</P>
<P>Hopton-hou&s;e is the next great object we meet. The fir&s;t view of it from the road, at a di&s;tance, over a bay of the Forth, is very picture&s;que. It appears behind a &s;loping hill, which hides one of it's wings. The horizontal lines of the hou&s;e, and the diverg|ing lines of the hill accord agreeably.&mdash;A regular building always appears be&s;t, when thus connected with &s;ome irregular object. A new &s;ource of beauty ari&s;es from the con|tra&s;t: and indeed without it, a regular building has &s;eldom a good effect. When the arti&s;t therefore is under the nece&s;&s;ity of painting a modern hou&s;e, he is under the nece&s;&s;ity al&s;o of breaking it's regularity, at lea&s;t with a few branches of trees, if he have nothing el&s;e at hand. Square lines, and angles uncontra&s;ted, can never be picture&s;que.</P>
<P>As we approach Hopton-hou&s;e, it's &s;itu|ation appears very grand. It is &s;eated on a magnificent lawn, which forms a kind of
<PB REF="88">

<PB REF="89">

<P><HI>Situation of</HI> HOPETON HOUSE.</P>

<PB N="69" REF="90">
terrace along the Forth. This lawn extends more than a mile in the front of the hou&s;e; and at the extremity of it the Forth (which is &s;till a noble e&s;tuary,) making a bold &s;weep, winds round it, and pre&s;ents the appearance of a wide, exten&s;ive lake, inter&s;per&s;ed with i&s;lands, and enlivened with a variety of &s;hip|ping.</P>
<P>Behind the hou&s;e the ground is more various, breaking into hills, vallies, and promontories, which &s;hoot into the Forth. All the grounds, to a con&s;iderable extent, appear planted and adorned, and the hou&s;e is very judiciou&s;ly flanked with wood again&s;t the north winds, which attack it from the Forth.</P>
<P>On this &s;ide, as well as in front, the Forth appears in various &s;hapes, a&s;&s;uming &s;ometimes the form of a lake, and &s;ometimes of a river, according to the point from which it is &s;een. The former &s;hape it a&s;&s;umes, when it is &s;een in lengthened per&s;pective; the latter when it is viewed directly acro&s;s. Under both ideas, it is equally grand.</P>
<P>Around this va&s;t and magnificent &s;cenery, ari&s;e mountains in various forms, and at various di&s;tances. In &s;hort, the whole &s;cene, and all it's appendages, on every &s;ide, as far
<PB N="70" REF="91">
as the eye can traver&s;e, is great, and noble; and the hou&s;e is &s;o fixed, as to receive the full advantage of it's &s;ituation.</P>
<P>With regard to <HI>improvements</HI> indeed little can be &s;aid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, little could be &s;aid in the year 1776, when we &s;aw it.

<P>The hou&s;e is a very magnificent piece of architecture.

That wing, which appears in the view, next to the Forth, is a range of &s;tables. The other, which is hid, is intended for a library; but it is not yet fini&s;hed. When it is compleat it will be a
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Colin Campbell, tho a Scotchman, was an Engli&s;h architect.</NOTE>

very noble room. Some of the other rooms al&s;o are grand; but, in general, the apart|ments are &s;maller, than we &s;hould expect to find in &s;o magnificent a &s;tructure: nor does the contrivance of the hou&s;e &s;eem equal to the beauty of the architecture.</P>
<P>The pictures, of which there is a numer|ous collection, have been cho&s;en with good ta&s;te: but mo&s;t of them were under&s;ized. Little pictures give a littlene&s;s even to a grand room. A &s;uitablene&s;s even in the&s;e things &s;hould be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>From Hopton-hou&s;e we &s;till continued our ride along the Forth; and were entertained, for &s;ome miles, with views of the woods, and grounds belonging to the noble man&s;ion we had left.</P>
<P>Many natural beauties al&s;o we &s;aw&mdash;hills and promontories, and winding bays, which had a fine effect in nature; and tho deficient in point of objects to characterize each &s;cene, they were &s;till accommodated to the pencil. A country may plea&s;e the eye in all it's naked, and unadorned rudene&s;s; but when a portion of it is &s;elected for a view, it's features mu&s;t
<PB N="72" REF="93">
be uncommonly &s;triking, if it can &s;upport it&s;elf without the ornament of &s;ome artificial object, which both characterizes a &s;cene; and adds dignity to it. The natural beauties of this country in a great degree rendered the&s;e appendages unnece&s;&s;ary. We had many noble views formed by the Forth, and it's lofty &s;hores, which would have made good pictures, tho un&s;upported by artificial objects. And yet in &s;ome parts we found objects al&s;o.</P>
<P>One view of this kind we had, which was very picture&s;que. It was a view of Blackne&s;s-ca&s;tle, which &s;hooting a con&s;iderable way into the lake, forms a bay between it, and the eye. This bay is one of the noble&s;t inland harbours in Scotland: and the ca&s;tle was its defence. It pre&s;erved al&s;o the communication by water between Sterling, and Edinburgh. In after times it became a &s;tate pri&s;on; and, if fame &s;peaks truth, could unfold, during the religious di&s;&s;entions of the country, many a tale of cruelty.</P>
<P>Objects often owe their happie&s;t effects to accidental circum&s;tances; and among others, as we have often ob&s;erved, to evening &s;uns. Let the picture&s;que traveller watch for the&s;e effects, and attend clo&s;ely to them, when he

finds them accompanied with a noble land|&s;cape. We had this accompaniment at Black|ne&s;s-ca&s;tle. The &s;un was now &s;et, and the &s;hades of evening were more and more effacing that ruddy glow, which had not yet left the horizon. Right again&s;t this fading &s;plendor ro&s;e the towers of the ca&s;tle. The outline appeared very di&s;tinct; but all the detail, and &s;urface were lo&s;t in ob&s;curity: while the land|&s;cape around was over&s;pread with that grey, and dubious tint, which brought the whole into the exacte&s;t harmony.</P>
<P>From hence we directed our cour&s;e to Fal|kirk. At Linlithgow, which lies in the road, the kings of Scotland had formerly one of their noble&s;t palaces; in the number and grandeur of which they &s;eem to have equalled any princes in Europe. This palace &s;tands on a ri&s;ing ground running into a lake; a &s;ituation which can rarely fail of plea&s;ing; but we were prevented by the weather from taking &s;uch a view of it as we wi&s;hed. In this palace was born the celebrated Mary queen of Scots.</P>
<P>In Linlithgow the hou&s;e is &s;till &s;hewn from whence the earl of Murray, regent of Scot|land,
<PB N="74" REF="96">
was &s;hot as he pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treet. It was one of the mo&s;t deliberate a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations upon record. Scotland, during the impri|&s;onment of Mary, was divided by vio|lent factions. The earl of Murray and his adherents &s;ided again&s;t the queen: the hou&s;e of Hamilton &s;upported her. A gentleman, of this name, and family, inflamed both by party, and a very flagrant private injury, re|&s;olved to de&s;troy the regent. He had long attended his motions, to find a favourable op|portunity; and at length determined to &s;hoot him, as he pa&s;&s;ed through Linlithgow in his way from Sterling to Edinburgh. The regent was riding lei&s;urely through the high &s;treet, talking with a gentleman on his left hand, when a mu&s;ket was fired &s;uddenly from a window on the right; and the regent receiving the ball, fell dead over his hor&s;e's neck. The hou&s;e from whence the blow came, was immediately a&s;&s;aulted; but the front door being barricaded, could not immediately be forced. Hamilton, in the mean time, mounted a &s;wift hor&s;e, which &s;tood ready at a po&s;tern, and e&s;caped.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="97">From Falkirk, we &s;till continued our rout to Sterling. In our way we cro&s;&s;ed the great canal; which forms the northern part of Scot|land into an i&s;land, by joining the frith of Clyde with that of Forth. Bu&s;y man is ever at work grubbing the &s;oil on which he exi&s;ts; &s;ometimes ca&s;ting up heaps, and &s;ometimes throwing them down. A few centuries ago the bands of Agricola were as eager in rai&s;ing this very &s;pot into a rampart, as our contem|poraries are now in delving it into a canal. Both works were great efforts of human power: but the Briti&s;h &s;eems to be the greater. It was a mighty work, no doubt, to rai&s;e an earthen mound &s;ufficient to confine a nation: but it is &s;till perhaps a greater work, to in|troduce a new element, and bring the &s;loops of the ocean to land their cargoes among the inland mountains of the country.&mdash;As a u&s;eful and humane work however the modern one is, beyond all doubt, more re&s;pectable; ina&s;much as it is more conducive to the hap|pine&s;s of mankind to open a communication between one country, and another; than to block a nation up in it's barbarity, and &s;hut
<PB N="76" REF="98">
it out from every opportunity of knowledge, and improvement.&mdash;In a picture&s;que light, I know not whether to call the Roman, or the Briti&s;h work, more di&s;gu&s;ting. Both equally deform the natural face of the coun|try.</P>
<P>In this neighbourhood are &s;till to be traced the works of Agricola. Some parts of the mound, which he threw up, and fortified between the Forth and the Clyde, are &s;till vi&s;ible; and known by the name of <HI>Graham's dyke.</HI> The antiquarian al&s;o traces many forts in different parts, where this mound ran, ca|pable of containing an army. It is not how|ever generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e were all the works of Agricola; but that other gene|rals, who &s;ucceeded him, made additions to what he had done.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e remains on the banks of the Carron, one of the mo&s;t remarkable was an edifice; the u&s;e, and origin of which exceed|ingly puzzled antiquarians. It was a rotunda, open at the top, like the Pantheon at Rome, tho of very inferior workman&s;hip, and dimen|&s;ions. From the ground to the &s;ummit of the dome it mea&s;ured twenty-two feet&mdash;the diameter in the in&s;ide was nineteen and an
<PB N="77" REF="99">
half. Boethius is the chief hi&s;torian, who gives us any account of it's more perfect &s;tate. He tells us, that it's area within was &s;ur|rounded by &s;tone &s;eats&mdash;that on the &s;outh was an altar; and that the floor had been te&s;&s;elated. The common people called it Ar|thur's oven: but many antiquarians have &s;up|po&s;ed it to have been a temple, built for the god Terminus by Agricola, on his fixing here the boundaries of the Roman empire. This valuable piece of antiquity was de&s;troyed by the proprietor, Sir Michael Bruce, in the year 1742, for the &s;ake of the &s;tone, with which it was con&s;tructed. The deed rai&s;ed &s;uch indignation in Dr. Stukely, that I have heard, he drew Sir Michael carrying off his lap full of &s;tones; and the devil goading him along. This drawing, mi&s;erable as we may &s;uppo&s;e it from &s;uch an arti&s;t, was en|graved, I believe, and publi&s;hed by the anti|quarian &s;ociety in their repertory.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of the new canal are the great forges of the Carron-works; which exhibit a &s;et of the mo&s;t infernal ideas. In one place, where coal is converted into coke
<PB N="78" REF="100">
by di&s;charging it of &s;ulphur, and the fire &s;pread of cour&s;e over a large &s;urface; the volumes of &s;moke, the &s;piry flames, and the &s;uffocating heat of the glimmering air, are wonderfully affecting. How va&s;t the fire is, we may conceive, when we are told, it con&s;umes often a hundred tons of coal in a day. At night it's glare is inconceivably grand.</P>
<P>In another part of the&s;e works, we admired the ma&s;&s;y bellows, which rou&s;e the furnaces. They are put in motion by water; and re|ceiving the air in large cylinders, force it out again through &s;mall orifices, roaring with a&s;toni&s;hing noi&s;e. The fire of the furnace thus rou&s;ed, becomes a <HI>glowing &s;pot,</HI> which the eye can no more look at, than at the &s;un. Under &s;uch inten&s;e heat, the rugged &s;tone in&s;tantly di&s;&s;olves in &s;treams of liquid iron.</P>
<P>Among the horrid ideas of this place, it is not the lea&s;t, that you &s;ee every where, black, &s;ooty figures wheeling about, in iron wheel-barrows, molten metal, glowing hot.</P>
<P>Within le&s;s than a mile from the Carron-works was fought the battle of Falkirk. The workmen pointing out the place on a moor; bad us ob&s;erve, upon the highe&s;t part of it, two &s;mall hou&s;es together, and one at a di&s;|tance:

<P>As we approach Sterling, the Forth, con|tracting it's dimen&s;ions, lo&s;es the form of an e&s;tuary; and takes that of a river: but we leave it's banks; and afterwards have only di&s;tant views of it; and the&s;e by degrees be|came le&s;s frequent. The country, through which we travelled, was in general flat, and barren of objects, except that here and there we had a mountain &s;cene in the off&s;kip. In one part we &s;aw the remains of an old fortre&s;s, called Bri&s;ca&s;tle; which rather diver&s;ified an unintere&s;ting &s;cene.</P>

<P>THE ca&s;tle of Sterling, tho an object of great importance, makes no appearance, till we approach within three miles of it. It has the air of the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; only in&s;tead of the formality of Arthur's &s;eat, the back-ground here is a &s;imple mountain. There is nothing very beautiful in the &s;cenery around it; but an object of &s;uch con&s;equence will give dignity to any &s;cene.</P>
<P>As we approach nearer, and the ca&s;tle comes forward from the back ground, it appears with &s;till more dignity.</P>
<P>Viewed upon the &s;pot, the <HI>out&s;ide</HI> of it is very inferior to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh. The rock, on which it &s;tands, has neither the height, the circumference, nor the broken &s;urface of that &s;uperb fortre&s;s. But if it be inferior on the out&s;ide, it is infinitely grander <HI>within.</HI> Edinburgh ca&s;tle is only a collection
<PB N="82" REF="104">
of barracks, magazines, and officers hou&s;es; whereas in Sterling-ca&s;tle you find very noble remains of royal magnificence. It was often the re&s;idence of the kings of Scotland. Almo&s;t the whole minority of James the &s;ixth, under his tutor Buchanan, was &s;pent here; and in trouble&s;ome times it was always a place of refuge to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of maje&s;ty. Accord|ingly it contains all the accompaniments of a regal re&s;idence; a palace, a chapel, and a parliament hou&s;e. The palace, in the in&s;ide, is totally without form, being now converted into barracks; but on the out&s;ide, it is very richly and curiou&s;ly adorned with grote&s;que figures. The chapel is an elegant and &s;imple pile; and the parliament hou&s;e is a very magnificent room: it is one hundred and twenty feet in length, and lofty in proportion. At the entrance of the ca&s;tle, the palaces of the earls of Argyle and Mar &s;tand, like two royal &s;upporters. They are now indeed in ruins; but they have once been very &s;ump|tuous buildings.</P>
<P>The views from the ca&s;tle are in general over a barren, and unintere&s;ting country: but
<PB N="83" REF="105">
amends is made by the &s;uperior excellence of one of them over the Forth, which has always been e&s;teemed the mo&s;t celebrated view in Scotland. It is not indeed picture&s;que; but it is exceedingly grand, and amu&s;ing. You overlook a flat valley of va&s;t extent, &s;tretching almo&s;t as far as Edinburgh; through which the windings of the Forth are very intricate, and curious. From the ca&s;tle gate to Alloa it is four miles by land; but if you go by water, it is above twenty. Through a few of the fir&s;t large penin&s;ular &s;weeps the eye can follow the cour&s;e of the river; but afterwards all becomes confu&s;ed, and broken into patches of land and water. At Alloa, the river is a mile broad: at Sterling, it is contained within four arches. Through the whole of this va&s;t channel the tide winds as through a great gut. But it is a &s;edgy, impure &s;tream; the flux and reflux of the tide continually mixing the &s;oil with it's waters, and &s;tirring up the mud. It is navigated as far as Sterling by &s;hips of &s;eventy or eighty tons: but if they tru&s;t to their &s;ails alone through the cour&s;e of this &s;inuous navigation, they mu&s;t wait for the benefit of every wind round the compa&s;s, two or three times over.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="106">The valley through which the Forth makes the&s;e uncommon windings, tho not a rich one, is by no means barren. It is varied with wood in &s;everal parts, with villages al&s;o, and other buildings; among which the abbey of Cambu&s;kenneth is con&s;picuous. Of this ruin nothing now remains, but a &s;ingle tower. On the right, this valley, which is wide in proportion to it's length, is bounded only by high grounds; but on the left, it is more nobly confined by the mountains of Ochil, and Clackmannan.</P>
<P>There are few countries perhaps on the face of the earth, of &s;uch narrow dimen&s;ions as Scotland, which have been the &s;cenes of a greater variety of military events. Inva&s;ions from Norway, from Denmark, and from Ireland&mdash;irruptions from the Roman barrier&mdash; together with the various feuds, and animo|&s;ities among the Scotch them&s;elves, which have been more frequent than among any other people, have deluged the country, through different periods, in blood. But above all, the con&s;tant quarrels between the Scotch, and Engli&s;h, which were generally
<PB N="85" REF="107">
decided in Scotland, have made it a fertile &s;cene of military events; to which &s;everal have been added by rebellions, &s;ince the union. In fact you can hardly a&s;cend any elevated ground, without throwing your eye over the &s;cene of &s;ome memorable action.</P>
<P>As the ca&s;tle of Sterling has for many ages been a fortre&s;s, we are not &s;urprized that it's neighbourhood abounds with &s;cenes of this kind. Many a &s;iege it has &s;u&s;tained; one through the &s;pace of a whole year again&s;t the pui&s;&s;ant arms of Edward the fir&s;t. Not fewer, I believe, than a dozen fields of battle may be counted from it's walls. Of the four great battles, which were fought by the two fir&s;t Edwards, in &s;upport of their tyranny in Scotland, three were in the vicinity of this ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Within two years after the battle of Dunbar, in which Edward the fir&s;t broke the power of Scotland, the &s;pirit of Wallace rou&s;ed the Scotch again to arms. Edward was then in France: but a large force under earl Warren endeavoured to quell them. A battle was fought under the walls of Sterling; in which Wallace was victorious.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="108">This &s;ucce&s;s drew Edward out of France. He entered Scotland at the head of a large army; and at the memorable battle of Falkirk, fought in the year 1298, broke it's power a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>The famous battle of Bannocburn was the la&s;t of the&s;e four great battles; and was fought within two miles of Sterling. This was the mo&s;t glorious action in the whole annals of Scotland; as it entirely freed it from the Engli&s;h yoke.&mdash;Philip of Mowbray held this fortre&s;s for Edward the &s;econd, which was almo&s;t the only fortre&s;s he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Mowbray was hard pre&s;&s;ed by the Scotts, and had pro|mi&s;ed to capitulate, if he was not relieved by &s;uch a day. Edward, in the mean time, re&s;olved to relieve him; and entered Scotland with an army much greater than had ever entered it before. Many hi&s;torians rate it at one hundred thou&s;and men, which number however is wholly incredible. Early on the morning of the 25th of June 1314, the Engli&s;h army was de&s;cried from the ca&s;tle, marching in gallant array to relieve them. The Scotch army, well po&s;ted, lay between. The walls were crouded with anxious &s;pectators. Very &s;oon the Engli&s;h cavalry, led on by the earl
<PB N="87" REF="109">
of Glouce&s;ter, was &s;een to pu&s;h forward, and begin the attack. But they were pre&s;ently repul&s;ed. Immediately after, the whole field was &s;een in confu&s;ion; but from what cau&s;e, could not at that di&s;tance be conjectured. This confu&s;ion &s;oon ended in a total rout. The Engli&s;h army fled; and the Scotts with all their force pur&s;ued. The ca&s;e was, the hor&s;e had been decoyed into pitfalls, where many of them being overthrown, the re&s;t fell back with confu&s;ion on the main body. The di&s;order was &s;till farther increa&s;ed by the ap|pearance of a new army marching round their flanks, tho in fact it was artfully compo&s;ed only of &s;uttlers, furni&s;hed with military en|&s;igns. The lowe&s;t accounts make the Engli&s;h to have lo&s;t, on that day, ten thou&s;and men. The earl of Glouce&s;ter was killed; and the king him&s;elf with difficulty e&s;caped.</P>
<P>As we &s;tood upon the &s;even gun battery an old gunner &s;hewed us the &s;ituation of the rebels, and their intrenchments, when they attacked the ca&s;tle in the year 1745. Blakeney, the governor, brought two or three of his bat|teries to bear upon a piece of ri&s;ing ground between him and their works, which he took it for granted they would endeavour to occupy.
<PB N="88" REF="110">
The &s;pot is &s;o near, that you may throw a &s;tone upon it from the walls. Then feigning intimidation, he ordered his men to lie clo&s;e, till the rebels, among whom he &s;aw every &s;ymptom of ra&s;hne&s;s, and inexperience, &s;hould advance their works to the de&s;tined ground. As &s;oon as they were well collected upon it, &s;uch a terrible di&s;charge of cannon, and &s;mall arms, bur&s;t at once upon them, from various parts, that &s;even hundred men were left dead upon the &s;pot, the re&s;t fled with trepidation; and the &s;iege was in&s;tantly rai&s;ed.</P>

<P>AS we left Sterling, we had a fine retro&s;|pect of it, in which the ca&s;tle takes a more exalted &s;tation, than any in which we had yet &s;een it.</P>
<P>At Sterling we cro&s;&s;ed the Forth, and tra|velling twenty four miles under the Ochil mountains, on the north &s;ide of the river, (a tract of country affording little amu&s;ement) we came to the town of Kinro&s;s with an intention to vi&s;it the &s;cenes of Loch-leven.</P>
<P>This lake, on the &s;ide next Kinro&s;s, is bounded by a plain; on the other &s;ide, by mountains. It is about eleven miles in cir|cumference, and is of a circular form: but as the eye views it on a level, it lo&s;es it's cir|cular appearance, and &s;tretches into length, forming many beautiful bays.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="113">Near the middle of the lake, are two i&s;lands. One of them is noted for pa&s;turage: the other (which contains little more than an acre of ground) is adorned with a ca&s;tle, which, as a &s;pot of peculiar beauty, or perhaps rather of &s;ecurity, was once a royal man&s;ion.</P>
<P>All the level &s;ide of the lake, between the water and Kinro&s;s, is occupied by open groves. At the we&s;t end of the lake &s;tands a hand&s;ome hou&s;e, delightfully &s;ituated, belonging to the family of Bruce. It was built in the reign of Charles the &s;econd by Sir William Bruce, for his own re&s;idence; and is e&s;teemed a beautiful piece of architecture. In this neigh|bourhood there is another monument of his genius; the hou&s;e of the earl of Rothes, near Le&s;ley; but we had not time to &s;ee it. The gardens at Kinro&s;s run down to the mar|gin of the lake; which in all it's &s;plendor is &s;pread before them. Sir William Bruce, when he built the hou&s;e, made wide plan|tations around it; which are now come to maturity. Indeed all it's appendages were &s;o plea&s;ing, that I do not remember being often &s;truck with a more beautiful &s;cene; which a &s;weet evening, no doubt, contributed greatly to improve. If we had &s;een it under a gloomy
<PB N="91" REF="114">
&s;ky, it might perhaps have lo&s;t &s;ome of it's beauties.</P>
<P>I &s;hall never forget the &s;weet compo&s;ure of an evening walk along the margin of the lake; &s;hrouded on the right by an irregular &s;creen of Mr. Bruce's pines; and open to the water on the left. A &s;oothing &s;tillne&s;s ran through the &s;cene. It was one of tho&s;e mild, &s;oft evenings, when not a breath di&s;turbs the air. About &s;un &s;et, a light grey mi&s;t, ari&s;ing from the lake, began to &s;pread over the land|&s;cape. Creeping fir&s;t along the &s;urface of the water, it ro&s;e by degrees up the hills; blending both together in that plea&s;ing ambi|guity, through which we can but ju&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;h the limits of each. I do not call this the mo&s;t beautiful mode of vi&s;ion: but it certainly exhibits in great perfection a gra|duating tint; which is among the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;ources of beauty. The mi&s;t becom|ing thinner, as it a&s;cended the mountain; the ground of cour&s;e appeared gradually &s;tronger, as it emerged from it.</P>
<P>Our view was &s;till improved by picture&s;que figures upon the foreground. Some fi&s;hermen were dragging a net to the &s;hore, which had been carried into the lake by a boat. We
<PB N="92" REF="115">
waited, till the contents of the net were di&s;|charged; among which were &s;ome very fine trout. We &s;aw them again at &s;upper; and found afterwards that this &s;pecies of fi&s;h, which is more red than &s;almon, is peculiar to this lake: and tho a critic in eating would travel many miles to ta&s;te this delicate food in perfection, we were informed it &s;old at the price of three farthings a pound.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle, which appeared floating on the lake, was a happy circum&s;tance in the &s;cene; pointing the view from every part. It was important in it&s;elf; and &s;till more &s;o by an a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, through it's connection with that unfortunate prince&s;s, Mary, queen of Scotts; who&s;e beauty, and guilt have united pity, and dete&s;tation through every part of her hi&s;tory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A late hi&s;torian, Mr. Whitacre, hath given the public &s;ome new lights on the hi&s;tory of Mary; and thrown the guilt on Elizabeth.</NOTE>. In this ca&s;tle &s;he was confined by the confederate lords, after the murder of the king, and her marriage with Bothwell.</P>
<P>Her e&s;cape from it was effected thus. The ca&s;tle belonged to a gentleman of the name of Douglas; to who&s;e care the confederate lords
<PB N="93" REF="116">
had intru&s;ted her. George Douglas, his younger brother, a youth of eighteen, lived in the fa|mily, whom Mary &s;ingled out as the in&s;tru|ment of her deliverance. When &s;he had &s;e|cured his heart, &s;he employed his abilities. A plan was laid between them, and executed on Sunday night, the 2d of May 1568. Young Douglas contrived, as his brother &s;at down to &s;upper, to &s;ecure the keys of the ca&s;tle. The queen &s;tood ready at the gate; which her faith|ful conductor locked behind her, and threw the keys into the lake. A boat had been prepared, and the oars of all the other boats were thrown adrift. Every po&s;&s;ibility of im|mediate pur&s;uit being cut off, the queen reach|ed the &s;hore in &s;ecurity; where lord Seaton, and &s;ir James Hamilton &s;tood ready, with &s;wift hor&s;es, to receive her.</P>
<P>Every picture&s;que &s;ubject may be treated on canvas two ways. The fact may be repre&s;ented under it's plain circum&s;tances&mdash;or it may be repre&s;ented under an allegory. The&s;e two modes of repre&s;entation an&s;wer to hi&s;tory, and poetry; both of which may often adorn the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> repre&s;entation of a fact, the arti&s;t has only to ob&s;erve the common rules
<PB N="94" REF="117">
of his art. He mu&s;t attend to de&s;ign, com|po&s;ition, light and &s;hade, expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o forth. But in the <HI>allegorical</HI> repre&s;entation, be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;omething more is required. The allegory mu&s;t be ju&s;t, and con&s;i&s;tent; and demands another kind of knowledge, be|&s;ides that of the principles of his art. It may be formed either on a heathen, or a chri&s;tian plan: but, on either, it mu&s;t be both uniform in it&s;elf; and agreeable to the mode of ma|chinery, which it adopts. It is the neglect of this uniformity, and propriety, which renders the allegorical mode of treating a &s;ubject, &s;o often di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>Nobody hath contributed more to bring contempt on allegory, than Rubens. Nobody painted more in that mode; and when he had to do with &s;ubjects, intirely fabulous, he ge|nerally did well: but in his attempts to alle|gorize hi&s;tory, he often failed. In repre&s;enting a marriage, for in&s;tance, he would not &s;cruple to introduce a chri&s;tian bi&s;hop performing the the ceremony; while Minerva, or the Graces perhaps waited as bride-maids. Nothing can be more ab&s;urd, than &s;uch a medley.</P>
<P>If the &s;ubject be treated <HI>hi&s;torically,</HI> let the king, or the prince give his daughter away;
<PB N="95" REF="118">
and let the gentlemen, and ladies of the court attend in their proper dre&s;&s;es. If it be treated in <HI>heathen allegory,</HI> erect the temple of Hymen &mdash;let the God him&s;elf appear&mdash;rear the altar&mdash; call in Juno pronuba&mdash;and let as many of the gods, and godde&s;&s;es attend in their different capacities, as may be thought convenient. But if the allegory be <HI>chri&s;tian,</HI> di&s;mi&s;s the heathen deities&mdash;introduce chri&s;tian virtues in their room&mdash;and deck the temple, and altar with proper appendages. Allegory thus treated is very plea&s;ing: and tho, where the &s;ubject is grand, and noble, I &s;hould in general prefer a hi&s;tory piece well-painted, to the &s;ame &s;ubject treated equally well in allegory; yet &s;uch &s;ubjects, as a marriage for in&s;tance, which af|ford few circum&s;tances of importance, and little room for expre&s;&s;ion, are be&s;t treated in the allegorical &s;tyle. The imagination of the painter mu&s;t inrich the poverty of the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>The little &s;tory of Mary's e&s;cape from Loch-leven, is one of the&s;e. It is replete with circum&s;tances, which admit of allegory; but are little adapted to hi&s;tory. Love is the &s;ubject of it; and love-&s;tories, which of all others are below the dignity of hi&s;torical
<PB N="96" REF="119">
repre&s;entation, are be&s;t con&s;igned to allegory. The narrative, in this light, might run thus; from which the painter might choo&s;e his point of time, and adorn his &s;ubject with &s;uch em|blematical appendages, as he liked be&s;t.</P>
<P>But neither the walls of Loch-leven ca&s;tle, nor the lake which &s;urrounded it, were bar|riers again&s;t love. Mary had tho&s;e bewitching charms, which always rai&s;ed her friends. She wore a ce&s;tus; and might be &s;aid to number among her con&s;tant attendants, the God of Love him&s;elf. His ready wit re&s;tored her liberty. Time, and place were obedient to his will. His contrivance laid the plan. His addre&s;s &s;ecured the keys: and his activity provided the bark; to which he led her; with his own hand carrying the torch, to guide her foot&s;teps through the darkne&s;s of the night.&mdash;Con|fu&s;ion ran through the ca&s;tle. Ha&s;ty lights were &s;een pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing at every win|dow; and traver&s;ing the i&s;land in all directions. The laughing God, the mean while, riding at the poop, with one hand, held the helm; and with the other waved his torch in triumph round his head. The boat &s;oon made the &s;hore, and landed the lovely queen in a port of &s;ecurity; where Loyalty, and Friend&s;hip wait|ed to receive her.</P>

<P>FROM Loch-leven we continued our rout northward, through a country of little curio&s;ity. About eight miles before we reach Perth, we have a noble view from the higher grounds of an exten&s;ive vale&mdash;the fertile coun|try of Strathern; through which the river Erne appears winding with many a meander, till it enter the Tay. This vale extends at lea&s;t thirty miles; and the eye commands it almo&s;t from end to end. Of the beautiful &s;ituations it affords great advantage hath been taken by the gentlemen of the neighbourhood. You &s;ee it in many parts marked with di&s;tant plantations; and can often di&s;tingui&s;h the buildings, of which the&s;e plantations are the appendages. Far to the we&s;t &s;tands Drum|mond-ca&s;tle, once the re&s;idence of the earls of Perth&mdash;now an ill-fated, for&s;aken man&s;ion.
<PB N="98" REF="121">
&mdash;In an oppo&s;ite direction, beyond the Erne, you di&s;tingui&s;h a rich &s;cene of plantation. There the earl of Kinnoul has extended his woods on every &s;ide. You may yet di&s;tingui&s;h Duplin-ca&s;tle ri&s;ing among them; but &s;oon the woods will totally ob&s;cure it. In it's neighbourhood was fought the celebrated bat|tle of Duplin; in which the family of Hay, like the Roman Fabii, were almo&s;t cut off to a man. From a pa&s;&s;age in Claudian one would &s;uppo&s;e, the Erne to have been often before dyed with blood.</P>
<Q>Scotorum cumulos flevit glaci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lis Ierne.</Q>
<P>Beyond the vale of Erne, which is a much richer land&s;cape, than is commonly found in Scotland, the eye is &s;till carried into a di&s;tance more remote. It ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hes where that river, at the end of the vale, enters the Tay; which is now a grand e&s;tuary, and is one of the principal features of the view. You trace it, if the day be clear, as far as Dundee; where mak|ing a &s;udden turn, it retreats behind the higher grounds. This whole va&s;t di&s;tance, both of Strathern, and of the vale of Tay, is bounded by mountains; as the Scotch views in general
<PB N="99" REF="122">
are, which add both ornament, and dignity to them.</P>
<P>We did not however &s;ee this land&s;cape with full advantage. The day was clear; and a noon-tide &s;un, in all it's dazzling brightne&s;s, had &s;pread over it that full profu&s;ion of light, which is &s;o unfavourable to land&s;cape. A per|pendicular ray &s;carce allowed the exi&s;tence of &s;hade: whereas to give the land&s;cape it's full advantage, the &s;hadow, not the light &s;hould have prevailed. The mountains par|ticularly &s;hould have been in &s;hade. In almo&s;t all ca&s;es the darkened mountain makes the mo&s;t re&s;pectable figure, except perhaps when under a morning, or an evening &s;un, you wi&s;h to tip it's prominent knolls with light. Under the &s;hadow of the mountains a gentle light &s;preading into the vale, would have had a beautiful effect; and as it decayed, it might have marked two or three objects with &s;plendor, to carry on the idea to the end of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>We did not enter Strathern; but left it on the right, and made towards the moun|tains of Moncrief.</P>
<P>From the&s;e heights we had a retro&s;pect of the &s;ame &s;cenes; only more extended. The
<PB N="100" REF="123">
vale of Erne, which lay before to the north, was now removed to the &s;outh: but under this different a&s;pect had &s;till a better effect; at lea&s;t it was &s;o much better enlightened, when we now &s;aw it, that it appeared to much greater advantage. In another direction the eye extended over the rich plains of Gowry, and the Frith of Tay, even to it's junction with the ocean.</P>
<P>The high grounds, where we now &s;tood, make a part of the Grampian hills, which run through the middle of Scotland, from Aberdeen&s;hire in the ea&s;t, into Argyle&s;hire in the we&s;t. Some interruption, no doubt, they meet with; and rarely, I believe, in any part, &s;well into mountains of remarkable note; but in the lowe&s;t parts they form a con&s;iderable ri&s;e, and on the whole may be e&s;teemed among the grand features of the country. In a pictu|re&s;que light, from the little &s;pecimen we &s;aw of them, they afford great variety of ground, ri&s;ing into well-&s;haped hills, and &s;inking into beautiful vallies, adorned with foaming rivulets, which carry their &s;uccours on both &s;ides of
<PB N="101" REF="124">
the Grampian, to the different rivers of emi|nence their &s;everal divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>But this country is &s;till more remarkable as a &s;cene of hi&s;tory, than of picture&s;que beauty. Here we trod, what may almo&s;t be called cla&s;&s;ic ground; where the la&s;t effort was made in defence of Briti&s;h liberty.</P>
<P>As yet the Glota, and Bodotria, (the friths of Clyde, and Forth) were the boundaries of the Roman power in Britain: and the neck of land between the&s;e e&s;tuaries, being for|tified<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 67.</NOTE>, confined the barbarous inhabitants within it's bounds. This curb they bore with impatience; and determined to exert them|&s;elves in driving the Romans &s;till farther from their frontiers. In one of their incur&s;ions falling upon the ninth legion in the night, they committed great &s;laughter.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e, and prudent Agricola, who commanded the Roman legions, &s;eems to have had no great de&s;ire to carry his arms farther: but being rou&s;ed by the&s;e repeated in&s;ults, he at length drew out his legions, and marched them into the enemy's country; ordering
<PB N="102" REF="125">
his fleet, which had &s;ailed round the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of England from Sandwich, and was then in the Forth, to attend his march.</P>
<P>The news of the Roman legions in motion &s;oon drew together the whole force of the Britons, under one of their able&s;t leaders. What was the name of this commander in his own barbarous language, we know not: but in the Latin of Tacitus he takes the name of Galgacus. This chief, &s;eizing the highe&s;t ground of the Grampian hills, re&s;olved there to wait the enemy. A battle en&s;ued; the particulars of which we have at large in Tacitus. The event was fatal to the Britons. They had fought gallantly through the whole day; but were at length intirely defeated, with the lo&s;s of ten thou&s;and of their men killed upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>The next morning, the Romans had a full view of the melancholy event. The field was now &s;ilent, and &s;olitary. Heaps of dead were lying round; but not a &s;ingle body of the enemy appeared, either on the plain, or in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any po&s;t; while the country at a di&s;tance was &s;een from the heights involved in &s;moke, as if it had been ravaged by an enemy. The cau&s;e was &s;oon di&s;covered.
<PB N="103" REF="126">
The Britons flying from the field, had them|&s;elves, with barbarian fury, &s;et fire to their own hou&s;es, and villages; and many of them had even put to death their wives and chil|dren <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The de&s;cription, which Tacitus gives of the behaviour of the Britons, after their defeat, is &s;o animated a picture of that irre&s;olution, and contention of various pa&s;&s;ions, which we might expect in a fierce, &s;avage people under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, that I cannot help tran&s;cribing it.</P>
<P>Britanni palantes, mixtoque virorum mulierumque ploratu, trahere vulneratos; vocare integros; de&s;erere domos, ac per iram ultro incendere; eligere latebras, et &s;tatim relinquere; mi&s;cere invicem con&s;ilia aliqua, dein &s;perare; aliquando frangi a&s;pectu pignorum &s;uorum; &s;aepius concitari: &s;ati&s;que con&s;tabat, &s;aevi&s;&s;e quo&s;dam in conjuges, ac liberos, tanquam mi&s;ererentur.</P></NOTE>. So innate a love of liberty burned within them, that when that was lo&s;t, they thought all was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The exact &s;pot, where this great battle was fought, is not ea&s;ily a&s;certained: but from the inve&s;tigation of learned antiquarians, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;omewhere among the&s;e hills; and I have heard there is a place, where the vale of Strathern unites with them, which is to this day called <HI>Galgachan-moor.</HI></P>
<P>Agricola, having refre&s;hed his troops, marched with a &s;low, and &s;olemn motion, through the country; ordering his fleet to
<PB N="104" REF="127">
&s;ail round the i&s;land, through the Orcades, and Hebrides, and along the we&s;tern coa&s;t of England. After a pro&s;perous voyage it arrived &s;afe at Sandwich in Kent; if that be, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be, the <HI>portus Trutulen&s;is</HI> of Tacitus; from whence, round the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, it had joined the army of Agricola in the frith of Forth.</P>
<P>This is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fir&s;t account we have of the in&s;ularity of Britain.

<P>On the other hand many writers before Tacitus &s;peak of Britain as an i&s;land; and Cae&s;ar gives us, with &s;urprizing accuracy, the dimen&s;ions of it.&mdash;I can only reconcile
<PB N="105" REF="128">
this difference, by &s;uppo&s;ing that Agricola's voyage was the fir&s;t <HI>authenticated</HI> circumna|vigation of Britain; and that all the accounts the Romans had before, were founded on con|jecture, and vague report; at lea&s;t not on any knowledge of their own.</P>
<P>Before I leave this account of Galgacus, I cannot forbear a &s;hort remark on the elegant, and judicious hi&s;torian, from whom we have it.</P>
<P>The candor of critici&s;m commonly allows the hi&s;torian to put the intentions and views of generals into the form of &s;peeches; tho &s;uch &s;peeches neither were, nor could be &s;poken. It is a graceful decoration of action; and gives life to a character. Of this the be&s;t models of hi&s;tory afford frequent examples. But then manners, and cu&s;toms &s;hould be well ob&s;erved. A Roman &s;hould &s;peak like a Roman; and a barbarian like a barbarian. But Tacitus &s;eems in this particular to have forgotten his u&s;ual accuracy. He has put a long and laboured &s;peech into the mouth of Galgacus, which had no kind of &s;imilitude to the manners of the Britons of that day, even as he him&s;elf de&s;cribes them. Galgacus &s;eems perfectly informed of the &s;tate, and hi&s;tory of
<PB N="106" REF="129">
mankind at that period; and rea&s;ons from a variety of topics, with &s;o much elegance, per&s;picuity, and coherence of argument, that Agricola him&s;elf, who harangues his troops in the next page, does not appear to more advantage. An inadvertence of this kind is the more &s;urprizing in Tacitus, as &s;uch ad|mirable rules with regard to <HI>propriety of character</HI> had ju&s;t been fixed by a celebrated writer, almo&s;t his contemporary.</P>

<P>WE were now de&s;cending the mountains of Moncrief; and as we approached Perth, we had a beautiful view of that town. and it's invirons. Strathtay, or the vale of Tay, was &s;pread before us. It is a level plain of con&s;iderable extent, &s;kreened with woods, and &s;urrounded with mountains. The Tay, forming a grand &s;tream, winds through it; and about the middle of the vale &s;tands the town; which with it's noble bridge, and the whole &s;cenery around, forms a very amu&s;ing land&s;cape.</P>
<P>This view, as we approach &s;till nearer, would be extremely picture&s;que, were it not for one awkwardne&s;s, which totally incapacitates it for the pencil. The Tay runs in a direct line between parallel banks, from the town to the eye.&mdash;In a foreground, I think, the pain|ter, tho copying nature, need pay little atten|tion to &s;uch awkwardne&s;&s;es; but may venture
<PB N="108" REF="131">
to correct them. A liberty of this kind mu&s;t be taken: it is impo&s;&s;ible to compo&s;e a picture without it. The tran&s;lation mu&s;t needs be bad, if the idiom of the language, into which you tran&s;late, be not ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Perth was once the capital of Scotland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 62.</NOTE>. Here the courts of ju&s;tice &s;at; the parliament a&s;&s;embled; and the king re&s;ided. It was then defended by a &s;trong ca&s;tle; and was remark|able for being the only walled town in the kingdom. It's dignity of cour&s;e &s;ubjected it to many in&s;ults. Whoever prevailed in Scot|land, had generally his eye fir&s;t on Perth. In the Engli&s;h wars, it was always warmly con|te&s;ted. Each of the three fir&s;t Edwards had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and each of them lo&s;t it. It had it's &s;hare al&s;o in the religious wars of 1559. And in the civil wars of the &s;ucceeding century, it was be&s;ieged fir&s;t by Montro&s;e; and afterwards by Cromwell. It's la&s;t &s;iege is &s;aid to have been the ba&s;is of it's glory. Cromwell's &s;oldiers being di&s;per&s;ed about the country, introduced a &s;pirit of indu&s;try, un|known before.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="132">The bridge at Perth, which is but ju&s;t fini&s;hed, is equal to any bridge we find on this &s;ide of We&s;tmin&s;ter. But the bridge at Perth has undergone as many revolutions as the town. It was &s;wept away in the year 1210 by a pro|digious flood, which de&s;troyed great part of the town it&s;elf. Many lives were lo&s;t; and the royal family e&s;caped with difficulty in a boat. Five times &s;ince that, it hath met the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>At Perth every &s;tranger mu&s;t look through the window of Gowry-hou&s;e, from whence James the &s;ixth called for help, when he feared a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination from the earl of Gowry. Among all the doubtful facts, which hi&s;|tory hath endeavoured to develop, this is one of the mo&s;t my&s;terious. Whether James intended to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the earl of Gowry, and his brother; or, whether tho&s;e noblemen in|tended to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him, is a point equally doubtful. Circum&s;tances the mo&s;t improba|ble attend both &s;uppo&s;itions. And yet the king was certainly attacked by the earl; and the earl was certainly killed by the king's attendants. The&s;e are the critical points, which chiefly exerci&s;e the judgment and pene|tration of the hi&s;torian: and it is very amu&s;ing to ob&s;erve, how admirably Dr. Robert&s;on has
<PB N="110" REF="133">
developed this dark affair. He fir&s;t &s;tates the facts; and &s;hews the almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ibility of either &s;uppo&s;ition. When he has brought his reader into this dilemma, who knows not what to think of the matter, he takes up the facts again&mdash;throws a new light upon them, on <HI>another &s;uppo&s;ition;</HI> and makes it very clear, that the earl of Gowry intended only to get James in his power, who was in fact the property of each party, as it gained the a&s;cendant.</P>
<P>Soon after we leave Perth we come in view of a place, famous in &s;tory; the ruins of Scone. Tho we cannot apply here the fir&s;t lines of Virgil's noble, and very picture&s;que de&s;cription of Latinus's palace&mdash;the grandeur of it's architecture&mdash;and the dignity of it's accompaniments&mdash;the
<Q><L>Tectum augu&s;tum, ingens, centum &s;ublime columnis,</L>
<L>Horrendum &s;ylvis, &amp; religione parentum: &amp;c.</L></Q>
we may however apply to it the following part of the de&s;cription.</P>
<Q><L>Hinc &s;ceptra accipere, &amp; primos attollere fa&s;ces</L>
<L>Regibus omen erat &mdash;</L></Q>
<P><PB N="111" REF="134">And yet Scone, tho in a &s;tate of ruin, was at lea&s;t &s;o far habitable in the year 1715, that the pretender found it &s;ufficient to re|ceive all his court; where he affected to live with the &s;plendor of maje&s;ty. Preparations too were making for his coronation; but they were interrupted by a body of the king's hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Scone on the northern banks of the Tay, as we rode along the op|po&s;ite &s;ide, appeared not unplea&s;ant. It is &s;urrounded by di&s;tant mountains; but lying low, it has not that grandeur of &s;ituation, which a palace demands.</P>
<P>The celebrated &s;tone-chair, the palladium of the Scotti&s;h empire, which formerly had it's &s;tation here, is now one of the appendages of royalty in We&s;tmin&s;ter abbey. I have heard that a &s;illy di&s;tich, in the form of a prediction, contributed not a little to reconcile many of the bigots of the Scotch nation to the union.</P>
<Q><L>Ni fallat fatum, Scoti quocunque locatum</L>

<P>From Scone we proceeded to Dunkeld, but met with nothing worth our notice, till
<PB N="112" REF="135">
we came within a few miles of it. This tract of country however, tho not beautiful, is remarkable. You pa&s;s over a very high, and flat plain. As you approach Dunkeld, this wild, un&s;hapely de&s;ert begins to &s;eparate into parts; and form it&s;elf into hills, hung with wood, and broken with rock. But, what is remarkable, from the&s;e high grounds you <HI>de&s;cend</HI> into the <HI>Highlands:</HI> for here the country begins, which takes that denomina|tion. The road winding among the hills of this de&s;cent, di&s;covers new beauties, as we advance. We had a ha&s;ty view of the abbey of Dunkeld&mdash;of a picture&s;que bridge over the Bran&mdash;of the mountains, that inviron the whole&mdash;and other objects as we pa&s;&s;ed. The &s;everal &s;cenes &s;hifted rapidly; and we &s;uffered them to pa&s;s; as we propo&s;ed after|wards to take a more di&s;tinct view of them. There is &s;omething very amu&s;ing even in a ha&s;ty &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of beautiful &s;cenes. The imagination is kept in a plea&s;ing perturbation; while the&s;e floating, unconnected ideas become a kind of waking dream; and are often wrought up by fancy into more plea&s;ing pictures; than they in fact appear to be, when they are viewed with deliberate attention.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="136">The object of our curio&s;ity at Dunkeld, was the &s;eat of the duke of Athol. From Inver we ferried over the Tay; and in cro&s;&s;ing, had a grand view up the river. It was a vi&s;ta of rock, and wood, which in nature's hands, was managed without any formality, and made a &s;cene of great beauty. We landed in the duke's garden; where a green walk along the &s;ide of the river, brought us to his hou&s;e. It is a villa, rather than a ducal man&s;ion: but being a favourite &s;pot, it has been the object of much attention, and expence.</P>
<P>Dunkeld was formerly both an archiepi&s;copal &s;ee, and an abbey: and the limits of the duke's improvements are tho&s;e, which formerly con|fined the monks. Nature has marked them with very deci&s;ive boundaries.</P>
<P>This favoured &s;pot (for it is indeed a beau|ful &s;cene) con&s;i&s;ts of a large circular valley, the diameter of which is in &s;ome parts a mile; in others, two or three. It's &s;urface is various; and &s;ome of the ri&s;ing grounds <HI>within the valley it&s;elf,</HI> would even be e&s;teemed lofty, if it were not for the grand &s;kreen of mountains, which circles the whole. At the ba&s;e of tho&s;e, towards the &s;outh, runs the Tay, in this place broad, deep and &s;ilent. The whole valley is
<PB N="114" REF="137">
inter&s;per&s;ed with wood; both on the banks of the river, and in it's internal parts; and would have been a &s;till more beautiful &s;cene, if art had done as much as nature. Much indeed it has done; but nothing well. Ca&s;|cades, and &s;lopes, and other puerilities deform a &s;cene which is in it&s;elf calculated to receive all the grandeur of land&s;cape. The walks &s;hew &s;ome contrivance; and might with a few alterations, be made beautiful. Indeed the whole is capable of receiving any improve|ment; and may by this time have received it. I &s;peak of it only as it was a dozen years ago.</P>
<P>The remains of the abbey, &s;hrouded in wood, &s;tand on the edge of the lawn; but rather too near the hou&s;e. The &s;olitude, which naturally belongs to them, and the embelli&s;hments which are nece&s;&s;ary about a habitable man&s;ion, interfere rather too much with each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this idea more explained; page 24.</NOTE>. The&s;e ruins con&s;i&s;t of the nave of the great church, the two &s;ide ailes, and the tower. The architecture is a mixture of Gothic, and Saxon; yet elegant in it's kind. The tower is hand&s;ome. At the
<PB N="115" REF="138">
we&s;t end we ob&s;erved the peculiarity of a round, ornamental window, which is not exactly in the middle, but appears, as if it had been pu&s;hed a&s;ide by the point of the large one. Part of the old cathedral is now the pari&s;h church; and is very beautiful, and very &s;lovenly. Near it is a &s;quare room, the burying place of the dukes of Athol, adorned with a tablet, containing the arms of all their connections.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the church, nothing of the abbey remains. And indeed in mo&s;t of the ruined abbeys, both in England, and Scotland, we find the great church is the only part left; which was owing to the piety of the times. It was merit to de&s;troy the <HI>habitations of the monks;</HI> but it was profanene&s;s to injure the <HI>hou&s;e of God.</HI> Thus Knox would exclaim, <HI>"Down with the ne&s;ts, and the rooks will fly off:"</HI> but his rage vented it&s;elf chiefly again&s;t the cells of the monks: the abbey churches were generally &s;pared. Such was the piety al&s;o of temporal &s;poilers. In a paper of Haynes's, to which reference hath already been made<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 38.</NOTE>, when we find an in&s;tance of a
<PB N="116" REF="139">
town, or a village de&s;troyed, we often find it &s;pecified al&s;o, that the church was left unin|jured. To this piety even amid&s;t the rage of war, and the zeal of reformation, we are indebted for mo&s;t of the ruins of abbeys, that are yet left in Britain.</P>
<P>Round one of the rocky mountains, which &s;kreen the valley of Dunkeld, the duke has carried walks; and has planted both that mountain, and &s;ome others. Many thou&s;ands of young pines are &s;truggling for exi&s;tence among the crannies of rocks; and many thou&s;ands more, which have gotten hold of the &s;oil, are flouri&s;hing greatly: for the &s;itua|tion &s;eems wonderfully agreeable to them: but on &s;o broad and lofty a ba&s;e, the whole has yet the appearance only of a green mo&s;s tinting the rocks; and it will be a century before the&s;e woods, thriving as they are, will have con&s;equence to break the lines of the mountains; and give a proper degree of &s;ylvan richne&s;s to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>On the top of one of the mountains behind the duke's hou&s;e, are five &s;mall lakes; which communicate: but we did not &s;ee them; nor is their &s;cenery probably of any value.</P>

<P>HAVING thus taken a view of that &s;ide of the Tay, on which the hou&s;e is placed, we cro&s;&s;ed it again to &s;ee the Hermi|tage; a name the duke has given to &s;ome improvements he has made on the Bran.</P>
<P>Down the &s;ide of one of tho&s;e mountains, which forms the &s;outhern boundary of the valley of Dunkeld, this river tumbles through a &s;teep rocky channel; and falls into the Tay, at Inver. A con&s;iderable part of the ground along it's cour&s;e the duke has inclo&s;ed: but his improvements are not &s;uitable to the &s;cene. Nothing was required but a &s;imple path to &s;hew in the mo&s;t advantageous manner the different appearances of the river, which is uncommonly wild, and beautiful; and &s;hould have been the only object of attention. In adorning &s;uch a path, the native fore&s;t wood, and natural bru&s;h of the place had
<PB N="120" REF="142">
been &s;ufficient. In&s;tead of this, the path, which winds among fragments of rock, is decorated with knots of &s;hrubs and flowers.</P>
<P>Rocks and flowers, no doubt, make a con|tra&s;t: and contra&s;t is a &s;ource of beauty. But the plea&s;ing contra&s;t &s;hould be founded either in <HI>harmony,</HI> or <HI>propriety.</HI> In Horace's human head joined to a hor&s;e's neck, there is contra&s;t; but it is &s;uch a contra&s;t, as the poet tells us every body would laugh at. The contra&s;t is ju&s;t the &s;ame between <HI>rocks,</HI> and <HI>cultivated flowers</HI>&mdash;between the grande&s;t works of nature; and the prettie&s;t little decorations of art. We object not to wild flowers, growing naturally among rocks. They are <HI>nature's decoration,</HI> and are nurtured in the &s;oil, that &s;uits them. We object only when we &s;ee <HI>the hand of art laying them out in knots.</HI> Such ideas in &s;cenes, dedicated to grandeur and &s;olitude are incon|gruous.</P>
<P>And yet <HI>propriety</HI> may &s;ometimes happily unite ideas, which in them&s;elves are in|harmonious. A bull, for in&s;tance, grazing with flowers tied to his horns, is ab&s;urd: but lead him in the pomp of &s;acrifice to the altar, and his flowers, which connect him properly with the &s;cene, for that rea&s;on become him.
<PB N="121" REF="143">
Thus an elegant path round the environs of a hou&s;e, where you would naturally expect the decorating hand of art, is plea&s;ing: <HI>propriety</HI> gives it <HI>beauty.</HI> But in a wild, rocky &s;cene, where you expect no human dwelling; nor any thing but the naked print of nature's foot, all appearance of <HI>artificial ornament</HI> offends.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed through this elaborate par|terre, half inclined to turn back at every &s;tep, we came unexpectedly to an a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cene.</P>
<P>The two rocky cheeks of the river almo&s;t uniting compre&s;s the &s;tream into a very nar|row compa&s;s; and the channel, which de|&s;cends abruptly, taking al&s;o a &s;udden turn, the water &s;uffers more than common violence from the double re&s;i&s;tance it receives from compre&s;&s;ion and obliquity. It's efforts to di&s;engage it&s;elf, have in a cour&s;e of ages undermined, disjointed, and fractured the rock in a thou&s;and different forms; and have filled the whole channel of the de&s;cent with fragments of uncommon magnitude, which are the more ea&s;ily e&s;tabli&s;hed, one upon the broken edges of another, as the fall is rather <HI>inclined,</HI> than <HI>perpendicular.</HI> Down this abrupt channel the whole &s;tream in foaming violence forcing it's way, through the peculiar
<PB N="122" REF="144">
and happy &s;ituation of the fragments, which oppo&s;e it's cour&s;e, forms one of the grande&s;t, and mo&s;t beautiful ca&s;cades we had ever &s;een. At the bottom it has worn an aby&s;s, in which the wheeling waters &s;uffer a new agitation, tho of a different kind.</P>
<P>This whole &s;cene, and it's accompaniments, are not only grand; but picture&s;quely beautiful in the highe&s;t degree. The <HI>compo&s;ition</HI> is per|fect: but yet the parts are &s;o intricate, &s;o various, and &s;o complicated, that I never found any piece of nature le&s;s obvious to imita|tion. It would co&s;t the readie&s;t pencil a &s;ummer day to bring off a good re&s;emblance. My poor tool was &s;o totally di&s;heartened, that I could not bring it even to make an attempt. The broad features of a mountain, the &s;hape of a country, or the line of a lake, are matters of ea&s;y execution. A trifling error e&s;capes notice. But the&s;e high fini&s;hed pieces of nature's more complicated workman&s;hip, in which the beauty, in a great degree, con&s;i&s;ts in the fini&s;hing; and in which every touch is ex|pre&s;&s;ive; e&s;pecially the &s;pirit, activity, clear|ne&s;s, and variety of agitated water, are among the mo&s;t difficult efforts of the pencil. When the ca&s;cade falls in a pure, unbroken &s;heet, it
<PB N="123" REF="145">
is an object of le&s;s beauty indeed, but of much ea&s;ier imitation.</P>
<P>This grand view, which I &s;cruple not to call the mo&s;t intere&s;ting thing of the kind, I ever &s;aw, is exhibited through the windows of a &s;ummer-hou&s;e; which I &s;uppo&s;e, gives name to the &s;cene: but it bears no re&s;emblance to the idea of a <HI>Hermitage.</HI> A more exact Hermitage had been a better decoration. We can conceive a reclu&s;e to have cho&s;en &s;uch a retreat, and to have felt tranquillity of mind perhaps the more forcibly near the roar of a cataract. It's noi&s;e might exclude every other idea, and leave the mind to it&s;elf.&mdash;But &s;uch a &s;ummer-hou&s;e as this would not &s;uit a reclu&s;e. It is too much adorned.</P>
<P>Among it's other ornaments, the panes of the windows are in part compo&s;ed of red and green gla&s;s; which to tho&s;e, who have never &s;een deceptions of this kind, give a new and &s;urprizing effect; turning the water into a cataract of fire, or a ca&s;cade of liquid verdi|grea&s;e. But &s;uch deceptions are tricks below the dignity of &s;cenes like this. Coloured gla&s;&s;es may be amu&s;ing; but I &s;hould rather wi&s;h to have them hung up in frames with handles to be u&s;ed at plea&s;ure, than fixed in a
<PB N="124" REF="146">
window, and to impo&s;e the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of looking through them.</P>
<P>The only picture&s;que gla&s;&s;es are tho&s;e, which the arti&s;ts call Claud Loraine gla&s;&s;es. They are combined of two or three different colours; and if the hues are well &s;orted, they give the objects of nature a &s;oft, mellow tinge, like the colouring of that ma&s;ter. The only u&s;e of the&s;e gla&s;&s;es, (which have little, but in &s;un&s;hine,) is to give a greater depth to the &s;hades; by which the effect is &s;hewn with more force. How far the painter &s;hould follow his eye, or his gla&s;s in working from nature, I am not ma&s;ter enough of the theory of colouring to a&s;certain. In general, I am apt to believe, that the merit of this kind of modified vi&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in it's no|velty; and that nature has given us a better apparatus, for viewing objects in a picture&s;que light; than any, the optician can furni&s;h.</P>
<P>From the Hermitage we continued our rout about a mile and a half farther up the river, to &s;ee another grand &s;cene upon the Bran, at a place called the <HI>Rumbling-brig.</HI> Here nature had almo&s;t formed a bridge of
<PB REF="147">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="125" REF="148">
rock, which is fini&s;hed by art. Under it's arch the river makes a noble ru&s;h, precipitating it&s;elf near fifty feet, between the two cheeks of the rock, which &s;upport the bridge. The &s;cenery too around it is very grand; but it is al&s;o very local: for all the ground at a little di&s;tance from the <HI>Rumbling-brig</HI> is a de&s;ert heath. This bridge made us &s;ome amends for having lo&s;t, through a mi&s;take, the &s;ight of another of the &s;ame kind, near Kinro&s;s; tho the <HI>rumbling-brig</HI> there was much &s;uperior in grandeur to this, as we were informed by tho&s;e who had &s;een both.</P>
<P>This &s;cene is not among the duke's im|provements: but we entered them again about a mile above the grand ca&s;cade; and were entertained with many beautiful pieces of rock &s;cenery in our return to the Hermitage.&mdash;Al|mo&s;t all the Scotch rivers are rapid, and rocky, as the rivers in mountainous countries commonly are; but we thought the Bran &s;uperior in the&s;e re&s;pects, to any we had &s;een. It's whole cour&s;e is a continued &s;cene of violence, op|po&s;ition, and every &s;pecies of agitation; till it's impetuous waters find peace at length in the tranquillity of the Tay.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="149">Very little advantage however is taken of the romantic banks of this river. The path might have been carried up one &s;ide of it, and down the other; &s;traying artle&s;&s;ly to tho&s;e parts, where the mo&s;t beautiful views are pre&s;ented; without any forced openings, for|mal &s;tands, white &s;eats, or other artificial introductions preparatory to the &s;everal &s;cenes. But this walk, which has neither nature in it, nor art, carries you up and down in the &s;ame track. It is fortunate however that you have &s;uch a variety of beautiful &s;cenes, that the eye is not di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;eeing them twice over.</P>
<P>In a gloomy cell, on the banks of the river, we found an in&s;cription, which joined it's kindred ideas with tho&s;e of the &s;cene.</P>
<Q><L>Ah! &s;ee the form, which faintly gleams:</L>
<L>'Tis O&s;car, come to cheer my dreams.</L>
<L>On wreaths of mi&s;t it glides away:</L>
<L>Oh! &s;tay, my lovely O&s;car, &s;tay.</L>
<L>Awake the harp to doleful lays,</L>
<L>And &s;ooth my &s;oul with O&s;car's prai&s;e.</L>
<L>Wake, O&s;cian, la&s;t of Fingal's line;</L>
<L>And mix thy &s;ighs, and tears with mine.</L>
<L>The &s;hell is cea&s;ed in O&s;car's hall,</L>
<L>Since gloomy Cairbar &s;aw thee fall.</L>
<L>The roe o'er Morven playful bounds,</L>
<L>Nor fears the cry of O&s;car's hounds.</L>
<L><PB N="127" REF="150">Thy four grey &s;tones the hunter &s;pies,</L>
<L>Peace to the hero's gho&s;t he cries.</L></Q>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed along the higher banks, we &s;aw another in&s;cription engraven upon a rock within the bed of the river; and as we de|&s;cended to it, we expected to &s;ee an account of &s;ome life pre&s;erved, or &s;ome natural cu|rio&s;ity found upon that &s;pot: but when we arrived at it, we were informed, in fair and hand&s;ome Roman characters, that a hole in the rock, near the in&s;cription (&s;cooped, as there were many, by the vortices of the river) was on &s;uch a day, &s;ome years ago, drunk full of punch by a &s;et of gentlemen, who&s;e names are in&s;cribed at length. The atchieve|ment appears to have been great in it's way; but one &s;hould have been &s;orry to have met the name of a friend recorded on &s;uch an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>At Dunkeld we heard, in all it's circum|&s;tances, the melancholy tale of the late duke of Athol's death. He had &s;hewn no &s;ymp|toms of de&s;pondency, till within a few weeks of that event; yet it was thought proper to
<PB N="128" REF="151">
give his &s;ervants a caution over him. His watchfulne&s;s however eluded theirs.</P>
<P>It was about eight o'clock in a dark No|vember night, when he &s;lipt out of a door, which opens upon the lawn. He was in|&s;tantly mi&s;&s;ed, and lights were di&s;patched in all directions; but without effect. His bro|ther was in the hou&s;e. The &s;ervants pri|vately informed him. A full hour was &s;pent in fruitle&s;s &s;earch. It was now thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary to inform the duche&s;s. Several hours pa&s;&s;ed in painful &s;u&s;pence. Intelligence of no kind could be obtained. Every one had his &s;u&s;picions; but no one dur&s;t avow them.</P>
<P>Some time after midnight, a fellow brought in the duke's hat, which he had found by the &s;ide of the river. This put an end to every glimp&s;e of hope: but the fatal event was not confirmed, till late the next morn|ing, when the body was found in the Tay, about three miles below the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>What it was that threw him into that dejection of &s;pirits, which occa&s;ioned this cata&s;trophe; or whether it was a malady of mind or body, could never be explained. No cau&s;e appeared, either from his fortunes, or any other circum&s;tance. He was one of the mo&s;t
<PB N="129" REF="152">
amiable noblemen in Scotland. His life was not only innocent and dome&s;tic; but correct, and virtuous: and what in men of his rank is more uncommon, I have heard, it was religi|ous. No man was more beloved: nor did any man enjoy more of that &s;erenity and cheerful|ne&s;s, which generally attend a benevolent, and well regulated mind.</P>
<P>When we &s;ee a man who has rai&s;ed a &s;udden and princely fortune by the iron arts of op|pre&s;&s;ion, &s;inking, after the heyday of enjoy|ment is over, into melancholy; unable to en|dure the horror of his own thoughts, and arm|ing his own hand again&s;t him&s;elf, we are not &s;urprized: it is the natural cour&s;e of things: it is the &s;erpent, that recoils upon it&s;elf. But when we &s;ee a man of virtue, and piety under the&s;e terrors of mind; when we &s;ee the ap|pearance of guilt in the brea&s;t of innocence; when we &s;ee that, neither the highe&s;t fortunes, nor even the cheerfulne&s;s of religion it&s;elf can &s;ecure the mind from the&s;e inbred horrors; human nature &s;tands aba&s;hed in the mid&s;t of all it's precarious enjoyments: we revere the my&s;|terious hand of heaven; and learn a le&s;&s;on of humility, which nothing el&s;e in this world can give.</P>

<P>FROM Dunkeld we continued our journey to Blair-ca&s;tle, which is about twenty miles farther north. The whole road is a continuation of picture&s;que &s;cenery. Through the fir&s;t eight miles we accompanied the Tay; which entertained us with all the playful variety that a river can exhibit. Sometimes it came running up to the foreground. Then it would hide it&s;elf beneath a woody precipice. Then again, when we knew not what was become of it, it would appear in the di&s;tance, forming it's meanders along &s;ome winding vale.</P>
<P>When we leave the Tay, we meet the Tummel, which, tho le&s;s wild in it's accom|paniments, performs it's evolutions with as much beauty. One &s;cene upon it's bank cal|led aloud for the pencil. We had many, in which were greater beauties; but they were mixed, as is often the ca&s;e, with &s;omething
<PB N="132" REF="155">
awkward. But this view was almo&s;t purely pic|ture&s;que. A broad &s;and-bank &s;tretched before the eye, as a &s;econd di&s;tance, round which the river formed an indented curve: it's banks were well decorated, and the view was clo&s;ed, in the fa&s;hion of Scotch land&s;cape, with beau|tiful mountains.</P>
<P>Mere <HI>drawing,</HI> without <HI>colouring,</HI> can at be&s;t, only expre&s;s the forms of objects; and by adding a little light and &s;hade, endeavour to grace them with &s;omething of an <HI>artificial effect.</HI> How much the face of nature mu&s;t &s;uffer from &s;uch partial imitation, is evident; as her colours and tints are her principal glory: but they are &s;o local, &s;o fugitive, &s;o mixed, and indi&s;criminate, that they mu&s;t often be taken on the &s;pot, or lo&s;t. The only <HI>true</HI> method of transferring the tints of nature, is, with your pallet in your hand: and every painter, who wi&s;hes to form him&s;elf as a colouri&s;t after nature, mu&s;t accu&s;tom him&s;elf to copy her features, and complexion, as he does tho&s;e of other beauties, from the life. And in this operation, it is his be&s;t method, when it is in his power, to watch the opportunity of the be&s;t lights: for the face of nature, like other

<P>The next be&s;t method of catching the hues of nature, is by tinting a drawing on the &s;pot, from which the arti&s;t may paint at his lei&s;ure. But this is a very imperfect method, as the hues of nature mu&s;t greatly evaporate, and lo&s;e their &s;pirit in a &s;econd tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t however in this matter, I cannot help mentioning a method which might per|haps be of &s;ome little u&s;e in fixing at lea&s;t the coar&s;er tints of nature, where time and oppor|tunity of doing it better, are wanting. Let the arti&s;t carry about with him a book, on the leaves of which are exhibited in &s;quares a va|riety of different tints. As all the tints of na|ture are &s;uppo&s;ed to be mixed from three ori|ginal colours, yellow, blue, and red, they may be cla&s;&s;ed under them. With the&s;e tints the arti&s;t may compare the hues of nature; and each &s;quare being numbered, he may fix a few characteri&s;tic hues in his drawing by a refer|ence to the number. I call this however a mere &s;uccedaneum; as there are a thou&s;and variegated tints in nature, which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to fix in this way: and indeed as the whole method is mere theory; and was
<PB N="134" REF="159">
never, as far as I know, applied to practice, it might be found, upon trial, very inade|quate.&mdash;This digre&s;&s;ion was occa&s;ioned by a view upon the Tummel, to which the co|louring of a &s;and-bank, and it's harmonizing with the objects in it's neighbourhood, gave a beauty, that in a mere <HI>uncoloured drawing</HI> is entirely lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The banks of the Tummel are chiefly pa&s;|toral, but when it is joined by the Garry, or rather received into it, we had an ample &s;peci|men of the &s;ublime. The pa&s;s of Killicranky began now to open, which is the great en|trance into the highlands in the&s;e parts; and may be called the Caledonian Thermopyle; tho indeed what are generally called the high|lands, as I ob&s;erved, begin at Dunkeld. This pa&s;s forms a very magnificent &s;cene. The vallies, as we approach it, are beautiful. Two or three gentlemen have fixed their habi|tations among them, and &s;eem to have made a good choice.</P>
<P>As we enter the pa&s;s, the mountains, on each &s;ide, expand in noble, irregular wings. The road takes the right, and may be &s;aid to
<PB REF="160">
<FIGURE>

<PB N="135" REF="161">
traver&s;e the <HI>ba&s;e</HI> of the mountain, when com|pared with it's &s;ummit: but when compar|ed with it's <HI>real ba&s;e,</HI> it is rai&s;ed to a giddy height. It is a great addition to the &s;cene to look down upon the river foaming among rocks, diving into woods, and forcing it's way among the huge fragments that have tumbled into it's channel from the mountain.</P>
<P>Two of the &s;cenes we met with in the&s;e wild regions, were particularly picture&s;que. In one the &s;loping corner of a mountain, with the road winding round it, forms the foreground: the middle is occupied by a bridge over the Garry; and &s;ome of the grand prominences of the pa&s;s fill the di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The other con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of a &s;econd di&s;|tance, in which the river forms a &s;ort of pool, and the mountains a very plea&s;ing combination around it.</P>
<P>By this time we had nearly opened the pa&s;s, which continues about a mile, di&s;playing, in one part or other of it's ample curve, every &s;pecies of rough and picture&s;que &s;cenery. In general, however, as it's lofty &s;kreens are brought very near the eye, they are too large, and refractory to be moulded into compo&s;ition. Innumerable parts of them may with little
<PB N="136" REF="162">
trouble be hewn into good foregrounds: but they afford few materials delicate enough for a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>In a military light, this entrance into the highlands has, at all times, been con&s;idered as a very formidable defile. In the la&s;t rebellion a body of He&s;&s;ians having been detached into the&s;e parts of Scotland, made a full pau&s;e at this &s;trait, refu&s;ing to march farther. It appeared to them as the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of habitable country.</P>
<P>In king William's time, it was marked with the de&s;truction of a royal army. The only &s;pirited attempt, in his reign, in favour of the Jacobite cau&s;e, was made by Clavers lord vi&s;count Dundee. This chief, who was a man both of honour and enterprize, collected a body of forces, and &s;et up the &s;tandard of the exiled prince. With great zeal he importuned all the di&s;affected clans to join him; but amid&s;t the warme&s;t profe&s;&s;ions he found only luke-warm a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Mor|tified by repeated di&s;appointments, and chagrin|ed at having the whole burden of the war upon him&s;elf, he was &s;kulking about Lockabar with a few &s;tarved, and ill armed troops, he&s;itating what cour&s;e to take; when he received advice, that general Mackay, who

was in que&s;t of him, at the head of the Engli&s;h army, was in full march towards the pa&s;s of Killicranky. In the mid&s;t of de&s;pair a beam of hope in&s;pired him. He harrangued his men; a&s;&s;ured them of &s;ucce&s;s; rou&s;ed them to action; and fell upon Mackay, as he filed out of the &s;traits, with &s;o much judgment, and well directed fury, that in &s;even minutes the Engli&s;h infantry was broken, and the hor&s;e in as many more.&mdash;In the article of victory Dundee was mortally wounded. An old highlander &s;hewed us a few trees, under the &s;hade of which he was led out of the battle; and where he breathed his la&s;t with that intrepidity, which is &s;o nobly de&s;cribed by a modern Scotch poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Poems by Robert Burns, p. 38,</NOTE>, in an interview be|tween death, and a victorious hero.</P>

<P>Dundee was the life of a cau&s;e, which in this &s;hort blaze of &s;ucce&s;s expired.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="164">From the &s;traits of Killicranky we &s;oon arrived within the di&s;trict of the Blair of Athol, as this part of the country is called. Blair|ca&s;tle, which is the capital of this wide domain, makes but a mean appearance. It &s;tands, as you approach it, under a mountain, with a wood before it: but the former is ill &s;haped; and the latter, which is chiefly of &s;ir, is formal.</P>
<P>Mean however as this ca&s;tle appears at pre|&s;ent in the light of a fortre&s;s, it was once a place of high renown; and has many a hi&s;tory annexed to it. As it was the only fortre&s;s in the&s;e wild parts, it was ever thought a place of con&s;equence; and had it's &s;hare in every di&s;turbance of the times. In many &s;cenes of violence it was engaged, during the feuds of ari&s;tocracy: but it makes no figure in hi&s;tory, before the civil wars of the la&s;t century. In the year 1644 it ventured to check the career of that celebrated hero the marqui&s;s of Mon|tro&s;e: but it paid dear for it's temerity. He laid &s;iege to it; and took it by a&s;&s;ault. Ten years after, it fell under the di&s;plea&s;ure of Cromwell; and experienced the &s;ame fate.
<PB N="139" REF="165">
But in the la&s;t rebellion it had better fortune. Sir Andrew Agnew &s;eized it with a body of &s;eventy hor&s;e, and held it for the king. The rebels twice attacked it, but each time without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The late duke of Athol &s;eeing his family &s;eat thus &s;ubjected to &s;o many in&s;ults on ac|count of it's &s;trength, took a re&s;olution to di&s;mantle it, that it might never again be an object of military concern. He did not per|haps &s;ufficiently con&s;ider, that if any future trouble &s;hould ari&s;e, it is full as likely in it's pre&s;ent &s;tate of weakne&s;s to become a prey; as in it's ancient &s;tate of prowe&s;s to have been made a fortre&s;s. Be it as it will, the pictu|re&s;que eye regrets the lo&s;s of it's towers, and battlements; and is hurt at &s;eeing a noble ca&s;tle transformed into an ordinary hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But tho Blair-ca&s;tle appeared, on our ap|proach, to &s;tand under a mountain, it changed it's &s;ituation, as we arrived on the &s;pot. The mountains take a circular form around it; and it &s;tands &s;eated on a plain, as the word <HI>Blair,</HI> in the Er&s;e language, implies. We found al&s;o, that notwith&s;tanding it's outward appearance, the apartments are noble, and furni&s;hed in grand ta&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="166">The &s;cenery about the hou&s;e is inferior to that at Dunkeld; and yet it is &s;uitable to the grandeur of a great hou&s;e, and capable of much improvement. The plain, on which the hou&s;e &s;tands, &s;preads about a mile in front; and might be beautifully diver&s;ified with lawns and wood. At pre&s;ent it is much injured by vi&s;tas, and a kitchen-garden, which tho extraordinary in it's way, is &s;till a nui&s;ance.</P>
<P>At the end of the plain runs the Tilt, a rapid and rocky &s;tream: but it is of no &s;ervice in the view; for it lies within &s;uch lofty banks, that it is invi&s;ible, till you arrive on the &s;pot. There the duke has conducted walks; but I cannot &s;ay much in prai&s;e either of the artifice with which they are conducted, or of their &s;implicity. In the cour&s;e of them you &s;ee the ca&s;cades of two or three &s;treams, which fall down the bank into the Tilt, and are admired more than they de&s;erve. The bank is of lofty and broken rock; and the &s;treams are by no means incon&s;iderable; yet the very circum&s;tance of their falling <HI>into the river</HI> is a great di&s;&s;ervice to them as capital ob|jects. It makes them appear &s;maller by bring|ing them into compari&s;on with a greater
<PB N="141" REF="167">
&s;tream. It exhibits them al&s;o in an awkward &s;ituation: for as they fall down the &s;ide of an extended bank, they do not fill the eye like a river, pouring down between rocks, and &s;een as a &s;imple object in one grand point of view. One of them is called the York-ca&s;cade, in compliment to the late archbi&s;hop Drummond; and is admired for it's broken &s;tages. For my&s;elf, I am more plea&s;ed with a &s;imple con&s;truction. That at Dunkeld indeed is infinitely broken; but it is &s;till one noble gu&s;h: whereas this is frittered, and divided into &s;everal di&s;tinct parts, each of which makes a little &s;eparate whole.</P>
<P>Having viewed the di&s;po&s;ition of the ground in the front of the hou&s;e, we viewed it next on the other &s;ide, where it is much more beautiful. The mountains here approach nearer the hou&s;e, between two of which runs a valley about a mile in length; and a quarter of a mile in breadth. The &s;ides and bottom of this valley are wholly filled with wood, through which runs a rocky and &s;ounding &s;tream. This beautiful piece of natural &s;ce|nery is improved as it ought to be. A delightful walk about two miles in length is conducted round it; and is in all it's
<PB N="142" REF="168">
parts ea&s;y, and natural; except that, here and there, a &s;emi-circular parapet is &s;et off from the walk, to &s;hew &s;ome parts of the river and rocks at the bottom. They might have been &s;hewn better by the &s;imple, and natural curve of the walk. The&s;e prepara|tory &s;tations always injure the effect, by exciting beforehand the expectation of it. The charm of novelty is &s;o far lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Between this &s;cenery and the hou&s;e are a few acres, which are laid out with more em|belli&s;hment; but le&s;s ta&s;te. What we chiefly admired here, were &s;ome firs of the &s;pruce kind, which we thought the mo&s;t picture&s;que, we had ever &s;een. They were indeed
<Q><L>&mdash; a &s;tately progeny of pines;</L>
<L>With all their floating foliage richly robed.</L></Q></P>
<P>If Dunkeld appeared more the retired &s;eat plea&s;ure; Blair-ca&s;tle, e&s;pecially in it's ancient form, was more the re&s;idence of the highland chieftain. Here he was always found in the article of danger. Here his clan mu&s;tered around him; and here he fed them, and kept their courage alive, from his exten&s;ive pa&s;tures, and va&s;t ranges of fore&s;t.</P>

traver&s;ing their exten&s;ive boundaries, and ex|amining their various inhabitants&mdash;in &s;pringing the ptarmigan, and other heath birds, that frequent them; in hearing their various cries and notes; and in &s;eeing tho&s;e herds of wild &s;tags, which are never &s;een in cultivated cha|&s;es; and among them the nimble roe-buck, bounding in it's native clime: but &s;o wide are the&s;e domains, that we were informed we might have travelled twenty or thirty miles, before we could have gratified our curio&s;ity.</P>

<P>FROM Blair to Taymouth, which we propo&s;ed next to vi&s;it, we found two roads; one to the north by Donacardoc, and the other to the &s;outh by repa&s;&s;ing the &s;traits of Killicranky. The latter is the better road, but we cho&s;e the former, as leading through a new country.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object, that called our attention, after we left Blair, were the falls of the river Freer. About two miles beyond Blair, we were directed to leave the road on our right, and to pur&s;ue the cour&s;e of that river, which, as it comes tumbling down a lofty hill, would &s;hew us &s;everal fine ca&s;cades. They were &s;carce worth &s;o long and perpendicular a walk. One of them indeed is a grand fall; but it
<PB N="146" REF="171">
is &s;o naked in it's accompaniments, and &s;een from &s;o bad a point, that upon the whole it is of little value.</P>
<P>In our way to Donacardoc, and beyond it, the country in general, is wild and moun|tainous: but the vallies are wide, and ex|ten&s;ive; and as we pa&s;&s;ed along their &s;weeping &s;ides, many of the &s;cenes were very noble. The mountains retiring in different di&s;tances from the eye, mar&s;halled them&s;elves in the mo&s;t beautiful forms, and expanded their va&s;t concave bo&s;oms to receive the mo&s;t enchanting lights. The picture&s;que traveller indeed, if he finds the lights as we found them, will be &s;ufficiently rewarded for his trouble in tra|ver&s;ing this rough country. The &s;cenes on the right, are tho&s;e, which will chiefly engage his attention.</P>
<P>And here I cannot help di&s;clo&s;ing what appears to me a truth; tho &s;o bold a one, that it ought only perhaps to be opened to the initiated. In the exhibition of di&s;tant mountains on paper, or canvas, unle&s;s you make them exceed their <HI>real</HI> or <HI>proportional</HI> &s;ize, they have no effect. It is inconceiv|able
<PB N="147" REF="172">
how objects le&s;&s;en by di&s;tance. Examine any di&s;tance, clo&s;ed by mountains, in a ca|mera, and you will ea&s;ily &s;ee what a poor, diminutive appearance the mountains make. By the power of per&s;pective they are le&s;&s;ened to nothing. Should you repre&s;ent them in your land&s;cape in &s;o diminutive a form, all dignity, and grandeur of idea would be lo&s;t. The ca&s;e is, a &s;crap of canvas compared with the va&s;tne&s;s of nature's &s;cale, <HI>mi&s;leads</HI> the eye; and if the <HI>exact proportion</HI> of the moun|tain be ob&s;erved, it is &s;o trifling, that we cannot ea&s;ily <HI>per&s;uade</HI> our&s;elves, it is the <HI>repre|&s;entative</HI> of &s;o va&s;t, and enormous a ma&s;s.</P>
<P>If indeed the mountain always, and in|variably appeared <HI>under one hue,</HI> the eye might in &s;ome degree learn to infer the di&s;tance from the colour, and of cour&s;e the bulk. But this is not the ca&s;e. The colour of mountains is as various, as the colour of the &s;ky. Light etherial blue, which is the colour of the air, is the hue thrown upon the mo&s;t removed objects. But the blue mountain can only be repre&s;ented under the bright and colourle&s;s &s;ky. You would often wi&s;h to adorn your land&s;cape with other appearances of nature; in which the di&s;tant mountain a&s;&s;umes other
<PB N="148" REF="173">
hues. It is brown, or it is purple, or it is grey: and all the&s;e in a variety of degrees. So that colour is by no means a criterion of bulk.&mdash;Be&s;ides you often wi&s;h to introduce your mountain nearer than the di&s;tance at which it a&s;&s;umes aerial blue. And when this is the ca&s;e, it's &s;urface is &s;ubject to a &s;till greater variety of tints; and it's bulk, is con&s;equently with more difficulty a&s;certained from it's colour.</P>
<P>Even <HI>in nature</HI> the eye is apt to make fre|quent mi&s;takes; and often misjudges with regard both to bulk, and di&s;tance; notwith|&s;tanding it is able to form compari&s;ons from the various objects that appear in the extent of land&s;cape around, which may a&s;&s;i&s;t the judgment. But in painting, the eye has not this a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It has only the objects of a very circum&s;cribed &s;pot to compare by, and cannot therefore deduce the real &s;ize of the mountain, for want of objects of compari&s;on. We mu&s;t therefore enlarge the &s;cale a little beyond nature, to make nature look like her|&s;elf. If indeed the picture and nature &s;hould be brought together, the deception will be apparent: otherwi&s;e the <HI>deception</HI> appears the <HI>reality.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="174">The celebrated boat of Raphael, in the cartoon of the draught of fi&s;hes, is a fiction &s;omewhat of this kind, in which the boat is repre&s;ented much le&s;s than the truth, le&s;t the real truth &s;hould offend. An object of the full &s;ize of a boat &s;o near the eye, would have ingro&s;&s;ed too much of the &s;pectator's attention; and the painter hoped the beauty of his figures would engage the eye &s;o much, as to pa&s;s over the inaccuracy. If indeed the ab&s;urdity could have been removed with a lit|tle contrivance, it would certainly have been better. As &s;o great a ma&s;ter however found rea&s;on to make his object too little; another arti&s;t, by a parity of rea&s;on, may make his object too large.</P>
<P>The ancient columnal &s;culptures at Rome were accompanied with a degree of this ar|tificial deception. As the figures at the top of the column, would be &s;een from the bottom dimini&s;hed out of all proportion, if they had been of the natural &s;ize, the &s;culptors very properly made them much larger than the life; &s;o that the eye &s;eeing them from the bottom, conceived them to be of the proper &s;ize.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="175">As we left the wild country about Dona|cardoc, we met our old acquaintance the river Garry: and were &s;urprized to &s;ee it, tho &s;o much nearer it's &s;ource, in better plight than it appeared at Killicranky. Here it oc|cupies a broad channel; and makes an ample &s;weep: but there, tho it had received many con&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ions, it made no figure. The ca&s;e was, it was there contracted, and limited within narrow banks, except in that part, where it &s;preads into a pool: &s;o that altho it contained more water, it made a le&s;s appearance.</P>
<P>From the banks of the Garry we found more coar&s;e country: but it was of no con|tinuance. The &s;teep &s;ides of Glen-lion received us, and afforded us &s;everal views, which were magnificent in their kind, into the deep rece&s;&s;es of the dell; where the river is &s;ometimes &s;een, but oftener only heard; and where it's &s;eque&s;tered haunts are &s;eldom interrupted by human curio&s;ity. The eye is often carried many fathoms below, into the&s;e depths of

&s;olitude; and is as often arre&s;ted in mid-way by the &s;preading tops of trees, from whence getting pa&s;&s;age perhaps again through &s;ome opening among them, it is baffled a &s;econd time, by the darkne&s;s of the rece&s;s. The &s;plendid tints of &s;un-&s;hine <HI>&s;leeping,</HI> as Shake&s;pear phra&s;es it, upon the tops of the trees, and the deep &s;hadows be|neath them, afforded the &s;tronge&s;t contra&s;t, and were blended with the mo&s;t perfect harmony; an effect, which nature is wonderful in pro|ducing; but which art, without great atten|tion, will fail in attempting. It is much ea&s;ier to carry off ju&s;tly a light or &s;hade; and blend it gradually with it's oppo&s;ite; than to manage with ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ion the extremes of either, when brought into contact. Amu|&s;ing as the&s;e views were, they would have been more &s;o, if the edge of the precipice on which we travelled, had been better guarded. Our attention, in &s;ome degree, was engaged by our danger.</P>
<P>Along the &s;ide of Glen-lion we mi&s;&s;ed our road; and in&s;tead of taking the direct way to Taymouth, we went &s;ix miles round by general Wade's bridge. This we had rea|&s;on to e&s;teem good fortune. What we mi&s;&s;ed we knew not: but the country we
<PB N="152" REF="178">
gained, was uncommonly beautiful. It is of that &s;pecies, which may be technically termed <HI>a plano-valley.</HI> Before us &s;tretched a cham|paign of four or five miles in length, and near two in breadth. Through the middle of it ran a winding road. On the right, it was &s;kreened by a mountain wooded with clumps, and varied with objects, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, as throws that equivocal veil over them, in which the eye &s;o much delights. The conclu&s;ion only of this mountain could be introduced in a picture: but the whole was beautiful in nature. The oppo&s;ite &s;kreen of the valley was &s;till bolder, more rocky, and equally picture&s;que. The middle was occupied by a fine di&s;tance of retiring moun|tains.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the right-hand mountain ran the Tay; but it kept out of &s;ight, till we had pa&s;&s;ed the bridge. It then took the lead among the objects, that entertained us; and pre&s;ented us with two or three fine reaches; in one of which e&s;pecially, the mountains, water, and wood combined with peculiar beauty in picture&s;que compo&s;ition.</P>

<P><PB N="153" REF="181">Soon after, we came to Kenmore, which is a neat little town, built by Lord Breadal|bin, at the foot of Loch-tay. Nothing can &s;tand more &s;weetly: the lake is &s;pread on one &s;ide of it, and on the other, are Lord Breadal|bin's improvements.</P>
<P>The view of the lake from the ri&s;ing grounds near the church, is capital. On the right, a lofty mountain falls into the water, and forms a grand promontory. It's lines at the ba&s;e are finely broken by a wooded i&s;land. Another promontory projects from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, and both together form the water into a &s;pacious bay. Between the two promontories the di&s;tant mountains recede in per&s;pective; and the lake goes off in the form of another bay. We &s;eldom meet with a grander piece of lake-&s;cenery.</P>
<P>Having taking this fir&s;t view of the lake, we embarked upon it; expecting, that as it's reaches opened, our entertainment would in|crea&s;e. But having continued our voyage near a league, we found no part equal to what we fir&s;t &s;aw.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="182">One inducement to this voyage, was a ca&s;cade on the banks of the lake, which had been repre&s;ented to us as an uncom|mon piece of &s;cenery. A pompous preface &s;o often produces di&s;appointment, that expect|ing a di&s;appointment here, we were agreeably &s;urprized. We found a very beautiful &s;cene. It is not indeed of &s;o &s;ublime a kind, as that of the Hermitage at Dunkeld. It is of a ta|mer nature, gliding down an excavated rock; but meeting with interruption enough to give it variety. It's accompaniments are very beautiful. The rock it falls from, is lofty, and well broken: and it graces the center of a little woody the|atre; which nature &s;eems to have made on purpo&s;e for it, and where it is &s;hewn to much advantage. Lord Breadalbin, to whom it be|longs, introduces the &s;tranger to it through a &s;ort of &s;ubterranean pa&s;&s;age, the nece&s;&s;ity of which did not appear. It is an exhibition, which wants no aid to give it con&s;equence.</P>
<P>In our return we had a view of the church and bridge of Kenmore, and of the mountains, and i&s;land, in it's neighbourhoood: but from &s;o low a point, they lo&s;t much of their digni|ty. We landed al&s;o upon the i&s;land; but found little to amu&s;e us.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="183">And yet this i&s;land, &s;mall and contemptible as it appears, has more than one hi&s;tory an|nexed to it. Here &s;tood formerly a &s;mall, but elegant priory dedicated by Alexander the fir&s;t of Scotland, to the memory of his belov|ed queen, who was the natural daughter of Henry the fir&s;t of England. At his death it was more liberally endowed; and he entru&s;ted the repo&s;e of his own &s;oul, as well as his queen's, to the prayers of pious monks, whom he e&s;tabli&s;hed for that purpo&s;e, in this religious retirement. Often in the calm &s;till hour of evening, or before the &s;un had ri&s;en upon the mountains, the boatman plying his cour&s;e, would re&s;t on his oars, to li&s;ten to the chanted hymn, or early matins, as they came floating in the breeze along the &s;urface of the lake.</P>
<P>In after times this i&s;land wore another face. When the bravery of Montro&s;e carried every thing before him in defence of the royal cau&s;e, which was nearly in it's wane in England; a numerous body of Campbells, again&s;t whom the rigour of Montro&s;e was chiefly directed, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this i&s;land, where they forti|fied them&s;elves among the ruins.

the hands of the loyali&s;ts till 1654, when general Monk retook it. It would now how|ever be difficult to trace the lea&s;t ve&s;tige in it either of religion, or war.</P>

<P>HAVING fini&s;hed our voyage, we took a walk to Taymouth, lord Breadal|bin's &s;eat, where we met with little to engage our curio&s;ity. The hou&s;e &s;tands on a lawn, between two mountains, which open to the lake; tho the architect has contrived to &s;kreen it intirely from the view of the water. The lawn is about a mile in breadth, diver&s;ified with a great variety of ground. Under the &s;outhern mountain, a quarter of a mile be|hind the hou&s;e, runs the Tay; which, tho not &s;o grand a river, as we found it at Dun|keld, is however a noble, and rapid &s;tream. The banks of the river, the lawn, and the mountains around, are all well cloathed with wood; and the whole &s;cene is capable of great improvement: but when we &s;aw it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the year 1776.</NOTE>, nothing like ta&s;te had been exerci&s;ed upon it.
<PB N="158" REF="186">
The hou&s;e was formerly a turreted ca&s;tle, and is now by the addition of two wings, a large, convenient, tho unplea&s;ing man&s;ion. The grounds around it were laid out with little beauty; and the walks were formal, and ill contrived; pacing under the paling of the park, in&s;tead of winding around, and taking &s;uch circuits as might &s;hew the lake, and mountains to mo&s;t advantage. There was a grand walk al&s;o beyond the Tay; which had co&s;t more than it de&s;erved. Indeed the walks on neither &s;ide of the river &s;eemed intended to &s;hew the &s;cenery; but rather as avenues to a few tawdry, inelegant buildings, which terminated them. Nothing could &s;hew a more thorough inattention to every idea of beauty and ta&s;te, than the whole contrivance of the place.</P>
<P>Perhaps no country in the world abounds more with grand &s;ituations, e&s;pecially in the highland parts of it, than Scotland: and per|haps none of the Scotch nobility have a greater variety of noble &s;ituations, than the earls of Breadalbin. Whether they wi&s;hed for ele|vated, or &s;heltered &s;ituations&mdash;for views of wood, of water, or of mountains&mdash;they had
<PB N="159" REF="187">
choice of every kind. When therefore, we &s;ee a &s;ituation &s;o unhappily cho&s;en, in the neighbourhood of &s;uch a &s;cene as Loch-Tay; we are apt to think it required &s;ome inge|nuity, and contrivance to fix it. The &s;itu|ation indeed in it&s;elf would not be &s;o bad, if we did not &s;ee every where around it, &s;ituations that are &s;o much better.</P>
<P>Of all the views which a great hou&s;e &s;hould wi&s;h to command, I think <HI>a noble di&s;tance</HI> is the mo&s;t de&s;irable. This was the opinion of Horace. He commends the hou&s;e,

And I think he is right. <HI>Di&s;tant views,</HI> if there is a good foreground, are generally the mo&s;t plea&s;ing; as they contain the greate&s;t variety, both in them&s;elves, and in their accidental variations. But if you have before your windows, a beautiful lake retiring among mountains into remote di&s;tance, as lord Bread|albin might have had, adorned with woody banks, and tufted i&s;lands; while his hou&s;e might have been &s;kreened from the rough quarters of the &s;ky; it is all one would wi&s;h for in a &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="188">As we left lord Breadalbin's, we had, from the road near Maxwell's temple, a very pic|ture&s;que view of the lake and it's environs.

great reluctance to the new yoke. Many ineffectual efforts having been made to bring them to a better mind, the <HI>ratio ultima regum</HI> was at length re&s;olved on; and a proclama|tion was i&s;&s;ued, which threatened them with military execution, if they did not take the oaths before the beginning of the year 1692. This mea&s;ure carried &s;trong conviction into the Highlands, and made &s;everal converts to the principles of the revolution. Many how|ever could ill brook the idea of what they e&s;teemed &s;o arbitrary a proceeding; and among the&s;e, the loude&s;t was Macdonald of Glencoe. This haughty chief, in oppo&s;ition to all the per&s;ua&s;ions of his friends, would exclaim with eager a&s;&s;everations, that he would &s;uffer any extremity rather than &s;ubmit. "When I take arms again&s;t them, he would cry, let them &s;end their military executioners: but while my opinions keep at home, they injure no man." Notwith&s;tanding however this lofty language, as the day of grace began to expire, his fears for his wife, his children, and his dependents, got the better of his indignation; and he made his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion at Inverary be|fore the &s;heriff of the county; tho, through
<PB N="162" REF="191">
an unavoidable accident, three or four days after the allotted period.</P>
<P>This chief it &s;eems, in the violence of the times, a little before the revolution, had plun|dered the lands of the earl of Breadalbin. For this, and &s;ome other acts of animo&s;ity, that nobleman, it is thought, had devoted him to de&s;truction; and is accu&s;ed of per|&s;uading king William to put him, and all his clan under military execution, as a terror to other di&s;affected parts of the Highlands. No inquiry therefore was made, whether Macdonald had &s;ubmitted, or would &s;ubmit; but a warrant for putting to death near two hundred innocent people, was di&s;patched with as little ceremony, as if it had been an order to apprehend a &s;muggler. This horrid war|rant having pa&s;&s;ed through all the u&s;ual forms, was brought to the king, who &s;igned it, it is &s;aid, without &s;cruple; tho I think, it is probable, that Macdonald's <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI> was con|cealed from him. Bi&s;hop Burnet indeed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his hi&s;tory of his own times.</NOTE> endeavours to make the king intirely ignorant of the whole affair. He was rather dilatory, the bi&s;hop &s;ays, in bu&s;ine&s;s; and u&s;ed to put
<PB N="163" REF="192">
off &s;igning papers, till they began to multi|ply; when he would &s;ign them in a lump with too little examination. In this preci|pitate manner, he gives us to under&s;tand, the king &s;igned the fatal warrant again&s;t the in|habitants of Glencoe.</P>
<P>From the king it was directed to the &s;e|cretary of &s;tate in Scotland; who &s;ent it, in the cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, to the commanding officer of Argyle's regiment, then in garri&s;on at Fort William.</P>
<P>Early in February, 1691, a detachment from that corps took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the valley of Glencoe; and when Macdonald inquired into their intention, he was told it was friend|ly; and had in view only to levy the arrears of &s;ome ill-paid taxes. Upon this Macdo|nald and his dependents, laid a&s;ide all appre|hen&s;ions (as indeed having &s;ubmitted to go|vernment, they had no grounds to harbour any) and entertained the troops ho&s;pitably, during the &s;pace of fifteen days.</P>
<P>On the evening of the &s;ixteenth day, young Macdonald ob&s;erved the guards were doubled; and thought he &s;aw &s;omething among the troops, which he did not well under&s;tand. He brought his &s;u&s;picions to his father: but
<PB N="164" REF="193">
the old man endeavoured with jocularity to di&s;per&s;e them. The youth however at the clo&s;e of day, drew his brother a&s;ide, and carried him out privately among the &s;oldiers, to make ob&s;ervations. Approaching a guard under the cover of the night, they overheard a centinel tell his fellow, that <Q>It was a brutal work, but their officers mu&s;t an&s;wer for it.</Q> Upon this the two young men in terror made in&s;tantly to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> father's hou&s;e: &mdash;but the bloody deed was begun. As they approached, they heard the report of fire arms &mdash;they heard the &s;hrieks of de&s;pair; and &s;aw the hou&s;e &s;urrounded by armed men. Old Macdonald was &s;hot through the head, as he &s;lept by his wife: and, at the &s;ame time, a Highland gentleman, who was then upon a vi&s;it to him; tho he had the king's pro|tection in his pocket. The hou&s;es of the tenants, and dependents of the family, were &s;urrounded al&s;o, and every man butchered, who was found. A pillage en&s;ued; and all the wanton cruelty was practi&s;ed, which is cu&s;tomary at the &s;acking of a town.</P>
<P>The women and children indeed were &s;pared: but &s;uch of them, as had neither died of the fright, nor had been butchered by mi&s;|take,
<PB N="165" REF="194">
were turned out naked, at the dead of night&mdash;a keen, freezing night,&mdash;with all their calamities about them, into a wa&s;te covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>When the morning ro&s;e, the horrid deed appeared in all it's guilt. Thirty-eight &s;laughtered bodies were drawn out; and the women, who had never attempted to fly, were in general found either &s;tarved to death; or expiring with their children under hedges. It was thought, that about a hundred of tho&s;e de&s;tined to &s;laughter, had e&s;caped through the intelligence given them by their friends among the troops.</P>
<P>This horrid affair was, never &s;ufficiently examined. King William endeavoured to repel the odium from him&s;elf, by throwing it upon the Scotch &s;ecretary; who had exceeded, he &s;aid, his orders. But various circum&s;tances, and e&s;pecially the lenity &s;hewn to all concerned in this bu&s;ine&s;s, rendered &s;uch an apology very defective. <Q>The king &s;ent orders, &s;ays Burnet, to inquire into the matter; but when the letters writ upon this bu&s;ine&s;s, were all examined, which I my&s;elf read, it appeared, that &s;o many were involved in the matter, that
<PB N="166" REF="195">
the king's gentlene&s;s prevailed on him to a fault; and he contented him&s;elf with di&s;mi&s;&s;ing only the ma&s;ter of Stair from his &s;ervice. Indeed the not puni&s;hing this with due rigour, was the greate&s;t blot in this whole reign.</Q></P>
<P>We did not &s;ee the valley of Glencoe; as it would have carried us too far out of our road: but it is de&s;cribed as one of the mo&s;t inte|re&s;ting &s;cenes in the whole country; hung with rock, and wood; and abounding with beauties of the mo&s;t romantic kind. This valley is famous al&s;o for being the birth place of O&s;cian. In it's wild &s;cenes that bard is &s;aid to have caught his fir&s;t poetic raptures. Near it lies the country of Morven; which Fingal hath turned into cla&s;&s;ic ground by his huntings, and his wars.</P>

<P>FROM Kenmore we propo&s;ed great plea|&s;ure in our ride to Killin, which was our next &s;tage. It lies at the head of the lake, which is about fifteen miles long; and as the road kept almo&s;t intirely by the water &s;ide, we expected many beautiful &s;cenes. But we were di&s;appointed. We had &s;een the lake in it's greate&s;t glory from Kenmore. It never &s;preads into any con&s;iderable expan&s;e of water; but has the appearance rather of a river of unequal dimen&s;ions. Where it is wide&s;t, it &s;eldom exceeds a mile: but in general it is much narrower. Nor are it's boundaries plea|&s;ing. They exhibit no bold &s;hores, broken promontories, nor other forms of beauty; but are rather tame hills, than picture&s;que moun|tains. Nor are they furni&s;hed with wood, or other plea&s;ing appendages.&mdash;Upon the whole however, as the evening was cold,
<PB N="168" REF="197">
&s;our, and unplea&s;ant, it is probable, that it tinged the land&s;cape with &s;imilar ideas. The effect is common. A clear evening might have di&s;pelled the&s;e gloomy vi&s;ions, which we attributed to the land&s;cape; and might have opened new beauties. I have heard indeed judicious travellers, who have &s;een it under a more favourable a&s;pect, &s;peak of many grand views from advantageous &s;tands along the &s;hores of the lake. Of this I have not the lea&s;t doubt; and am only unhappy in not being able to add my own te&s;timony to what I have heard.</P>
<P>As we approached Killin, the country began to amend, and plea&s;ed us in &s;pite of the untoward medium of a drizzling rain, through which we viewed it. Many of the hills were cloathed with wood; and &s;ome of them finely di&s;po&s;ed, &s;kreening little irriguous vallies, which played among them. But as the evening grew wor&s;e, and &s;et in wet, we could not examine the land&s;cape as it de&s;erved. In general, however, the two ends of Loch-Tay are certainly the mo&s;t beautiful parts of it.</P>
<P>The town of Killin is celebrated for being the receptacle of the bones of Fingal. We
<PB N="169" REF="198">
were &s;hewn the place, where tradition &s;ays, they were buried: but the traveller mu&s;t view his tomb with the eye of faith. Not the lea&s;t monumental fragment remains.</P>
<P>At Killin we heard the little hi&s;tory of a Highland migration. Several expeditions of this kind to America, from different parts of Scotland (which were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been attended with &s;ucce&s;s) began to make a noi&s;e in the country; and a di&s;contented &s;pirit got abroad, even in tho&s;e parts, where no oppre&s;|&s;ion could be complained of; particularly in the domains of the earl of Breadalbin; the happine&s;s of who&s;e tenants &s;eems to have been among the principal &s;ources of the happine&s;s of their lord. The <HI>word was given,</HI> as it was phra&s;ed, in the beginning of March 1775; and a rendezvous was appointed at Killin, on the fir&s;t of the en&s;uing May. Here convened about thirty families, making in all above three hundred people. The fir&s;t night they &s;pent at Killin, in barns, and other out-hou&s;es, which they had previou&s;ly engaged. Early the next morning the whole company was called together by the &s;ound of bag-pipes, and the order of their march was &s;ettled. Men, women, and children, had all their
<PB N="170" REF="199">
proper &s;tations a&s;&s;igned. They were all dre&s;&s;ed in their be&s;t attire; and the men were armed in the Highland fa&s;hion. They who were able, hired carts for their baggage: the re&s;t di&s;tributed it in proper proportions, among the &s;everal members of their little families; each of them, in the patriarchal &s;tyle, <HI>carrying provi&s;ions for the way.</HI> Then taking a long adieu of their friends, and rela|tions, who gathered round them, the mu&s;ic began to play, and in the mid&s;t of a thou&s;and good wi&s;hes mutually di&s;tributed, the whole train moved on.</P>
<P>Gold&s;mith, in his de&s;erted village, gives a melancholy picture of a body of emigrants, taking a la&s;t farewell of their country.</P>
<Q><L>Even now, methinks, as pondering here I &s;tand,</L>
<L>I &s;ee the rural virtues leave the land:</L>
<L>Down, where yon anchoring ve&s;&s;el &s;preads the &s;ail,</L>
<L>That idly waiting, flaps in every gale,</L>
<L>Downward they move, a melancholy band,</L>
<L>Pa&s;s from the &s;hore, and darken all the &s;trand.</L></Q>
<P>But the&s;e emigrants were of a different &s;tamp. Many of them were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two or three hundred pounds, and few of le&s;s than thirty or forty; which at lea&s;t &s;hewed, they had not &s;tarved upon their farms. They were
<PB N="171" REF="200">
a jocund crew; and &s;et out, not like people flying from the face of poverty; but like men, who were about to carry their health, their &s;trength, and little property, to a better mar|ket. The fir&s;t day's march brought them to Loch-Lomond, which is about twenty-five or thirty miles from Killin. At the head of this lake they had provided ve&s;&s;els, in which the greater part of them embarked; and were carried by water twenty-four miles farther, into the neighbourhood of Dunbar|ton; where they cantoned them&s;elves, till their tran&s;port ve&s;&s;el was ready at Grenock.</P>
<P>We propo&s;ed al&s;o to vi&s;it Loch-Lomond, and Dunbarton; but not by the rout of the&s;e emigrants; which would have abridged our tour. We cho&s;e a wider circuit by Tindrum and Inverary.</P>
<P>From the plea&s;ing environs of Killin we launched out into a wild country, which na|ture had barely produced; but had done little to adorn. Neither had art ever deigned to vi&s;it it, except in the &s;hape of a &s;oldier work|ing on a military road. Even the cottage &s;moking among a few trees, which almo&s;t every heath pre&s;ents, was not here to be found. All was wide, wa&s;te and rude; to|tally
<PB N="172" REF="201">
naked; and yet in it's &s;implicity often &s;ublime; the ground heaving, like the ocean into ample &s;wells; and &s;ub&s;iding into vallies equally magnificent. The ideas were grand, rather than plea&s;ing. The imagination was intere&s;ted, but not the eye. Here and there indeed a mountain-&s;cene fell within the rules of compo&s;ition. But in general, we had few forms of picture&s;que beauty, at lea&s;t in the larger parts. In the &s;maller, we often found them; in the winding of rivulets, in their rocky beds, and in their little bu&s;tling ca&s;cades, of which we had great variety.</P>
<P>The ground plot, if I may &s;o call it, of this rude land&s;cape, was a wild valley, <HI>a&s;cend|ing</HI> through the &s;pace of twenty miles from Killin to Tindrum. It could not be called &s;teep; yet was generally &s;teep enough to give rapidity to the rocky rivulet which adorned it. This rivulet is one of the chief &s;ources of Loch-Tay: but it does not a&s;&s;ume the name of the Tay, till it leave the lake. About the middle of this a&s;cent, the country becoming flat, we found the torrent arre&s;ted by a valley; and formed into a &s;mall lake, called Loch-Dochart; the &s;hores of which afforded us &s;ome fine &s;cenery, both when we
<PB REF="202">

<PB N="173" REF="203">
&s;aw it in extent (for tho it was &s;mall, it had dimen&s;ions &s;ufficient for any land&s;cape) and when we &s;aw only a portion of it. In the former &s;ituation, the di&s;tant hills made an agreeable boundary to the water. In the lat|ter we had a huge promontory hanging over a ca&s;tle, which &s;tood upon an i&s;land at it's feet.</P>
<P>The great picture&s;que u&s;e of i&s;lands, in the&s;e &s;ituations, is to break the tedious lines of &s;uch promontories, and mountains, as fall into the water. But this i&s;land, be&s;ides it's u&s;e in compo&s;ition, is it&s;elf an object of beauty. It is decorated with wood; and adorned with a ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Ca&s;tles in the middle of lakes, tho not proper for regal fortre&s;&s;es, were commonly cho&s;en as &s;eats of &s;ecurity by tho&s;e chiefs, who had the advantage of &s;uch &s;ituations. The i&s;land-ca&s;tle could only be attacked by water. In &s;ummer the lake could not af|ford navigation to carry over a body of men; and in winter the ice formed &s;o expo&s;ed an approach, that troops would hardly attempt it. There was no covering above ground; and the mattock could make none beneath. This ca&s;tle however was once &s;tormed by the M'greggors, in the mid&s;t of a fro&s;ty winter, by a well contrived project. They brought
<PB N="174" REF="204">
a va&s;t quantity of fa&s;cines to the edge of the lake, with which they made a &s;tout brea&s;t-work. This they pu&s;hed before them along the &s;mooth &s;urface of the ice; and being &s;ufficiently defended by it from the &s;hot of the ca&s;tle, they made good their landing, if I may &s;o &s;peak; and quickly overpowered the place, which tru&s;ted more in it's &s;ituation, than in the &s;trength of it's garri&s;on.</P>
<P>About Tindrum we had attained the &s;um|mit of our a&s;cent. This place is &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the highe&s;t inhabited parts of Scotland&mdash;&s;ome &s;ay of Great-Britain. The word Breadalbin, in which country we now travelled, has that &s;ignification.</P>
<P>Among the mountains, which compo&s;e the&s;e wild &s;cenes, the mountains of Bendoran are the mo&s;t con&s;picuous. The country-people con&s;ider them as inchanted mountains. Before the &s;torm begins to rage, they emit a hollow &s;ound, which forebodes it. The &s;hepherd knows it well, and in&s;tantly &s;helters his flock. Sounds however of this kind are not peculiar to mount Bendoran. They are often mentioned among the &s;igns of bad weather. They were progno&s;tics of ancient times.</P>

<P>At Tindrum the ground which had been ri&s;ing from Loch-Tay begins <HI>immediately</HI> to fall. The Tay which takes it's &s;ource at the &s;ummit of this elevation, runs due ea&s;t; and a little lake within a quarter of a mile of the fountains of the Tay, di&s;charges it's waters due we&s;t. Along the banks of this little bu&s;tling &s;tream we de&s;cended through a valley, wild like that we had left behind, and nearly in the &s;ame &s;tyle of land&s;cape; but of quicker de&s;cent.</P>
<P>Near Dalmaly the view opened upon a rich cultivated country, at lea&s;t &s;uch it appeared&mdash; a &s;ight we had not met with for many days. We thought it could hardly be compo&s;ed of the plains of Lorn, tho that is the riche&s;t part of Argyle&s;hire; and lay directly before the eye; but our maps &s;eemed to place Lorn at too great a di&s;tance; and we had no op|portunity of inquiring. The remote di&s;tance however was dubious; and tho it appeared to us a cultivated &s;cene, it might have been through &s;ome deception in the light. The
<PB N="176" REF="206">
nearer grounds were varied by a part of Loch-Awe; towards which we approached.</P>
<P>Loch-Awe is one of the grande&s;t lakes in Scotland. It extends thirty miles; and con|tains near a dozen i&s;lands. We &s;kirted only it's northern &s;hores; but were much amu&s;ed with what we &s;aw. On the oppo&s;ite &s;hore ari&s;es, in appearance almo&s;t perpendicular to the lake, the va&s;t mountain of Crouachan, near enough for the eye to di&s;tingui&s;h it's woods and rocks. Beneath it, on an i&s;land, &s;tands the ca&s;tle of Kilchurn, which is a grand object under the impending gloom of the mountains. This ca&s;tle was built originally by the Lady of one of the Campbells, who went to the holy wars. Here in &s;olitary retirement, &s;he mourned his ab&s;ence, and waited his return. In after ages the ca&s;tle of Kilchurn taking a more dignified form, became the &s;eat of the earls of Breadal|bin, and was admired chiefly for the view it commanded over the lake, and over a rich vale, bounded by lofty mountains. It afterwards be|came a fortre&s;s; and when the rebellion broke out in the year 1745, was ha&s;tily fortified by Lord Breadalbin for the government, and garri&s;oned to defend this pa&s;s into the Highlands; which intention I believe it fully an&s;wered.</P>
<P><PB REF="207"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="208">Be&s;ides this i&s;land, we had two others in view, both woody, and both very ornamental. On one of them &s;tood formerly a convent. We had al&s;o a long extent of water before us. The lake winds &s;lowly, and falls off in good per&s;pective, exhibiting a great variety of bays, promontories, and large penin&s;ulas. In many parts al&s;o the &s;cenery around it was woody; but yet on the whole, it had rather an unpicture&s;que appearance. The i&s;lands are formally &s;tationed; and many of the moun|tain-&s;kreens, which are unadorned with wood, are tame, and unbroken.</P>
<P>We took two drawings however upon this lake. In one of them, two of the i&s;lands appeared with great advantage; and the moun|tain-&s;kreens behind them, con&s;i&s;ting only of &s;imple parts, were magnificent.</P>
<P>The other view was more contracted, and exhibited a large promontory, under which &s;tood the i&s;land, with the ruins of Kilchurn-ca&s;tle. The con&s;tituent parts of this latter view are the &s;ame as tho&s;e we had ob&s;erved upon Loch-Dochart: but it is one of nature's &s;amene&s;&s;es: it is <HI>alter et idem.</HI> There the i&s;land appeared connected with the promon|tory, under which it &s;tood; here it appeared
<PB N="178" REF="209">
detached from the lake, and connected with the foreground. In each &s;ituation the i&s;lands broke the lines of the promontories, and had a good effect. But the i&s;land on Loch-Awe afforded the better picture.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e lakes de&s;erved more attention, than we were able to pay them. We wi&s;hed to make a circuit round them, and view them in various points. The i&s;lands upon Loch-Awe, however formal they might appear in &s;ome views, would unque&s;tionably have a fine effect in many other &s;ituations: and pro|montories, which, on one &s;ide, appeared &s;mooth, tame and unadorned, might appear broken, animated, and rich on another: but our time was limited; and we were obliged to &s;atisfy our curio&s;ity with little more than a view of &s;uch parts, as the road pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>From the neighbourhood of Loch-Awe we pur&s;ued our rout to Inverary-ca&s;tle, the prin|cipal &s;eat of the duke of Argyle. A very long and dreary ride had made us langui&s;h for the contra&s;t of a little woody &s;cenery: when the fore&s;ts ro&s;e, as if by inchantment; va&s;t, rich, and luxuriant. Whole mountains
<PB N="179" REF="210">
in a great degree, were covered with woods of ancient &s;tanding; which &s;inking into their deep &s;hadowy rece&s;&s;es, or &s;tanding out boldly upon their knolls in broad ma&s;&s;es enlightened by the &s;un, wonderfully charmed the eye, both with the greatne&s;s, and novelty of the &s;cene. They &s;eemed planted to exemplify the following precept.</P>
<Q><L>Does then the &s;ong forbid the planter's hand</L>
<L>To clothe the di&s;tant hills, and veil with woods</L>
<L>Their barren &s;ummits? No; but it forbids</L>
<L>All poverty of cloathing. Rich the robe,</L>
<L>And amply let it flow, that nature wears</L>
<L>On her throned eminence. Where'er &s;he takes</L>
<L>Her horizontal march, pur&s;ue her &s;tep</L>
<L>With &s;weeping train of fore&s;t; hill to hill</L>
<L>Unite with prodigality of &s;hade.</L></Q>
<P>Some powerful hand, it was evident, had been at work in cloathing the naked &s;ides of all the&s;e va&s;t ridges; and we might have known, by the noble decoration of the &s;cene, that we were in the dominions of &s;ome po|tent chieftain, tho we had not known it, by the geography of the country. Every moment we looked, when the ca&s;tle would open to our view. But we travelled at lea&s;t four miles among the&s;e Alpine plantations, before we arrived at it.</P>

<P>INVERARY-CASTLE fully an&s;wered the grandeur of the approach. It &s;eems equally adapted to all the purpo&s;es of great|ne&s;s, beauty, and accommodation. It &s;tands upon a gentle ri&s;e, the ground gradually &s;loping from it in various directions. The area, which &s;urrounds it, is &s;pacious, con|taining two or three miles in circumference; and is bounded, behind the ca&s;tle, by a &s;emi-circular &s;kreen of mountains, ri&s;ing in different forms, &s;ome of them broken, and others adorned with wood; &s;o that the ca&s;tle &s;tands in a kind of mountain-rece&s;s, open in front; where it commands a &s;pacious view over Loch-Fyne. One of the&s;e mountains, called Doniquaick, is a noble, &s;pirited object. It's &s;ides are &s;haggy, and broken; and the inter|&s;tices of &s;oil are filled with wood. On it's &s;ummit &s;tands a lonely watch-tower, which
<PB N="182" REF="214">
like every thing characteri&s;tic has a good effect. Had it been an ornamental building of any kind, thus loftily &s;eated, it had been ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>At the foot of this mountain, runs the Aray, a con&s;iderable &s;tream. It i&s;&s;ues through a narrow valley, behind the hou&s;e; and taking a &s;emicircular &s;weep around it, at the bottom of the lawn enters Loch-Fyne.</P>
<P>This lake which is the glory of the &s;cene, &s;preads into a noble bay before the front of the ca&s;tle; forming an irregular circle of about twelve or fourteen miles in circumference, beautifully indented with a variety of penin|&s;ulas, and &s;urrounded by mountains. It is an object, not only beautiful in it&s;elf; but it makes a fine contra&s;t with the woods, and mountains around it.</P>
<P>Loch-Fyne is a &s;alt lake, communicating with the &s;ea, at the di&s;tance of about twenty-five miles from Inverary ca&s;tle, but as the tide has no very great effect upon it here, it has almo&s;t all the beauties of an inland lake; and &s;ome, which an inland lake cannot have; particularly that of a very crouded navigation. It is one of the favourite haunts of herring; and at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year is frequented by innumerable &s;hoals. The country-people
<PB N="183" REF="215">
expre&s;s the quantities of this fi&s;h in &s;trong language. At tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, they &s;ay, the lake contains one part water, and two parts fi&s;h. In this &s;ingle bay of the lake, we were told that above &s;ix hundred boats are &s;ometimes employed in taking them. The groups of the&s;e little fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els with their circling nets make a beautiful moving picture; which is frequently varied by ve&s;&s;els of a larger &s;ize, &s;hooting athwart; threading the &s;everal little knots of anchoring barks; and making their <HI>tacks</HI> in every direction.</P>
<P>The herring-boats commonly take their &s;tation on the lake, as the evening comes on; and if all this moving picture &s;hould happen to be enlightened with a &s;plendid &s;un &s;et, the effect is very fine. The crews of the&s;e boats &s;eem generally to be a cheerful, happy race. Among the implements of each boat, the bag|pipe is rarely forgotten; the &s;hrill melody of which you hear con&s;tantly re&s;ounding from every part; except when all hands are at work. On Sunday, the mirth of the &s;everal crews is changed into devotion: as you walk by the &s;ide of the lake, if the evening be &s;till, you hear them &s;inging p&s;alms, in&s;tead of playing on the bagpipe.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="216">The mountain of Doniquaick, and the lake, are two very harmonious neighbours, in every point, in which they are brought together. We &s;aw them contra&s;ted in &s;everal forms; and always beautifully. One of the grande&s;t views of the whole may be taken &s;omewhere about the new-inn. The mountain of Doni|quaick&mdash;a bridge over the Aray&mdash;the lake, and the mountains, which &s;kreen it, all unite in very plea&s;ing compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>From the bay, which Loch-Fyne forms before the ca&s;tle of Inverary, run two grand openings; one to the north-ea&s;t into the country; and the other to the &s;outh-we&s;t towards the &s;ea: but all appearance of the&s;e outlets is excluded from the ca&s;tle by the folding of the mountains. I mean not by this remark, to expre&s;s any peculiar excellence in the circular form of a bay. This particular one indeed contains great variety, and is very beautiful in it's kind: but &s;till there is in general more variety, and more beauty, in the fading di&s;tance of a lake going off in per|&s;pective.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Inverary is new, but con|&s;tructed in the old ca&s;tle form. The ground plot is &s;quare; and each corner is adorned
<PB REF="217">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="185" REF="218">
with a round tower. In the middle ri&s;es a &s;quare one, which is higher than the re&s;t, and gives a picture&s;que apex to the building. The whole is grand, and makes an appearance &s;uitable to the &s;cene. Yet there are two very di&s;gu&s;ting parts about it. The&s;e are the &s;quare appendages, which are tacked to each &s;ide of the middle tower, for the purpo&s;e of furni&s;hing the interior apartments of the ca&s;tle with light. The contrivance is awkward; and greatly injures a noble pile. The in&s;ide &s;eems to be admirably divided into grand, and convenient rooms; but it is yet unfini&s;hed. At the entrance is a guard chamber; which in mo&s;t private hou&s;es would be ridiculous; but in a Highland ca&s;tle is characteri&s;tic, and gives an uncommon dignity.</P>
<P>In one of the apartments we were &s;truck with a number of &s;mall paintings in a fine old mellow &s;tyle; but all of them evi|dently by the &s;ame hand. Upon examining them more attentively, we found them all copies from pictures we knew; &s;ome of which were very modern. Enquiring farther into the my&s;tery, we were informed, they were all the work of the pre&s;ent duche&s;s of Argyle; and were in fact mezzotinto-prints, varni&s;hed
<PB N="186" REF="219">
with gum-copal; and painted on the back, in a manner lately invented. I have &s;een no invention of the kind that has &s;o much merit. Coloured prints are in general mi&s;erable daubings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The method here mentioned, of colouring mezzotinto prints, was at this time, ju&s;t invented; and was &s;old, under promi&s;e of &s;ecre&s;y, to many ladies.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This noble ca&s;tle was built by Archibald, duke of Argyle, who fini&s;hed little more than the &s;hell: but his ideas &s;eem to have been &s;o grand; that it is probable he would have &s;truck out &s;omething beyond the ta&s;te of the times, in the improvements around it, if he had lived to complete his de&s;igns. One great work he had in view, was to remove the whole town of Inverary, which was in|deed a great nui&s;ance to him. Part of it had even &s;traggled between the ca&s;tle and the lake; and the whole, a dirty, ill-built hamlet, was a di&s;grace to the &s;cene. With a grandeur of conception, equal to his other de&s;igns, the duke re&s;olved to pull the whole down; and rebuild it upon a penin&s;ula in the lake, about half a mile from his ca&s;tle. The &s;ituation was admirably cho&s;en, at lea&s;t for the benefit
<PB N="187" REF="220">
of the town; tho it may &s;till perhaps a little interfere with the views of the ca&s;tle; par|ticularly of that down the lake towards the &s;outh. The duke proceeded &s;o far in his plan, as to build a noble row of hou&s;es; one of which is an inn, and another a cu&s;tom hou&s;e: but his death prevented the completion of this grand de&s;ign.</P>
<P>In his &s;ucce&s;&s;or's time, all operations were at a &s;tand: but the pre&s;ent duke has called his workmen again together. He has already removed as much of the old town, as was a nui&s;ance to him&s;elf: but whether he means to carry his predece&s;&s;or's full intention into exe|cution does not yet appear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am informed that all the old town is now removed.</NOTE>. About the ca&s;tle however he is making great improvements; and, as far as he has yet done, in a very good ta&s;te. A grand walk is conducted over a noble bridge, at the foot of Doniquaick, and along the banks of the river; from which an offset carries you in a &s;piral up the moun|tain. From the watch-tower, at the &s;um|mit, we were informed, that one of the grande&s;t views in Scotland is exhibited, over
<PB N="188" REF="221">
Loch-Fyne, and the neighbouring mountains. &mdash;But a wet morning prevented our &s;eeing it.</P>
<P>In a word, as Inverary-ca&s;tle has one of the noble&s;t &s;ituations that can be conceived, it will probably in a few years, be as well worth vi&s;iting, as any place in Britain; if the improvements continue in the &s;ame &s;tyle of &s;implicity and grandeur, in which they are begun. No place we had yet &s;een in Scot|land, if we except Hopeton-hou&s;e, can bear the lea&s;t compari&s;on with it. If we found fault with any thing, it was with &s;ome little decorations, and ca&s;cade-work upon the river; but as the&s;e things might have been executed be|fore, and may ea&s;ily be altered, all cen&s;ure &s;hould cea&s;e, till the whole be fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>We had now almo&s;t completed our tour through the Highlands of Scotland, Inverary being the la&s;t town of any con&s;equence we vi&s;ited in that di&s;trict; and through our whole journey were greatly plea&s;ed both with the face of the country, and with the manners of the inhabitants. The former may pro|bably have &s;ome effect upon the latter. The
<PB N="189" REF="222">
extremes of heat and cold produce nearly per|haps the &s;ame effect. The &s;avage, under a &s;outhern clime, is languid, and inert; under a northern one, benumbed, and torpid. It is in the middle regions, that we find the bolde&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;pirited exertions. I &s;peak of men in a barbarous &s;tate. Civilization brings all to a level. The early and un|civilized native of this country &s;eems to have had great vigour of mind and body; but it was the vigour of a wild bea&s;t. Indolence and activity took their turns in his brea&s;t. Every pa&s;&s;ion had it's cour&s;e, and when it's rage was &s;pent, he &s;unk into &s;loth. He was ea&s;ily offended: fierce in his anger, and im|placable in his revenge, he &s;hed blood without remor&s;e.</P>
<P>Some years ago, an old manu&s;cript was printed at Gla&s;gow, under the title of <HI>Feuds and conflicts among the Scotti&s;h clans.</HI> It con|tains many anecdotes, very de&s;criptive of the ancient manners of the country. One little hi&s;tory I &s;hall pre&s;ent to the reader from the materials <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page, 39, &amp;c. and page 95, &amp;c.</NOTE> which it furni&s;hes, and the co-incident circum&s;tances of the times. It is
<PB N="190" REF="223">
an account of the petty wars between Angus Macdonald of Kintire, and Sir Laughlan Mac|lean of the I&s;le of Mull; and is both curi|ous in it&s;elf, and will give a better idea of the ancient &s;tate of the Highlands, than any &s;y&s;tematic inquiry. It is likewi&s;e nearly connected with the &s;cenes we are now &s;ur|veying. The characters too are drawn from the life, and well marked.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIX.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT two centuries ago, it happened, that Donald Gorme, a gentleman of the i&s;le of Sky, propo&s;ing to vi&s;it his relation Angus Macdonald of Kintire, was driven by adver&s;e winds into Invernook-bay in the i&s;le of Jura. This place belonged to Sir Laughlan Maclean; who happened to be there him&s;elf at that time, tho his principal re&s;idence was in Mull.</P>
<P>In Jura al&s;o, by an unu&s;ual concurrence of circum&s;tances, happened to lurk &s;ome out-laws; whom Donald Gorme for certain offences, had lately driven from their country. The&s;e fugitives, under&s;tanding to whom the ve&s;&s;el in the bay belonged; and not having
<PB N="192" REF="225">
it in their power to injure Gorme them&s;elves, contrived a very malicious &s;cheme to draw upon him the re&s;entment of Maclean. In the &s;ilence of the night, they drove &s;ome of Maclean's cattle towards the bay; and carried them off; not doubting but the &s;u&s;picion would re&s;t on Gorme.</P>
<P>Su&s;picion is the evidence of barbarians. Maclean, a young, fiery chief, without farther inquiry, collected his clan the next night, fell upon Gorme, and killed &s;ixteen of his people. Gorme him&s;elf, and a few of his followers, with difficulty e&s;caped.</P>
<P>When Angus Macdonald of Kintire, to whom Gorme's vi&s;it had been intended, heard of this di&s;a&s;ter, he was much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and the more, as he was nearly related to both parties. He was fir&s;t cou&s;in to Gorme; and had married the &s;i&s;ter of Maclean. Fearing therefore the con&s;equences of the affair, he re&s;olved to employ his good office in making it up.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t efforts were in the i&s;le of Sky, were he found Gorme not untractable. From thence he &s;ailed to Mull; propo&s;ing an in|terview with Maclean at Ca&s;tle-Duart, the
<PB N="193" REF="226">
place of his re&s;idence.&mdash;But his friends advi&s;ed him to be cautious.</P>
<P>As the Scotti&s;h government inclined to ari&s;tocracy, it had ever been the regal policy to divide the clans: and to this end the crown, on feudal principles would often take the occa&s;ion of very &s;light pretences, to grant &s;ome favoured chief a claim on the lands of his more obnoxious neighbour. The&s;e grants being commonly obtained, when families were at va|riance, gave a kind of &s;anction to their quar|rels.</P>
<P>A claim of this kind had formerly, it &s;eems, been granted to the Macleans, upon &s;ome lands in Ilay, which belonged to the Macdonalds: and tho the claim had long lain dormant, and the families were now united by marriage; yet the friends of Mac|donald advi&s;ed him not to put him&s;elf in the hands of a youth, who&s;e character was little known; and whom, for that rea&s;on, it was imprudent to tru&s;t. But Macdonald naturally frank, and generous, and unacquaint|ed with fear, could not conceive, that a man, whom he had never offended, and who&s;e &s;i&s;ter he had married, could po&s;&s;ibly intend him ill. He went therefore with all confi|dence
<PB N="194" REF="227">
to Ca&s;tle-Duart: and even left, the greate&s;t part of his retinue behind.</P>
<P>Maclean received him courteou&s;ly; and gave him hopes that Gorme's conditions might be the ba&s;is of an agreement; and put an end to the unhappy affair between them. But in the hour of retirement other thoughts po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him. The &s;ecret whi&s;pers of intere&s;t and am|bition intervened; and all &s;cruples of integrity, and honour were thrown a&s;ide. Before the morn|ing he had &s;ettled the whole affair in his own mind; and with a confident air informed his a&s;toni&s;hed gue&s;t, that he mu&s;t expect to &s;pend his future life in captivity, unle&s;s he gave up all title to the di&s;puted lands in Ilay. The unfortunate Macdonald had no choice. He was obliged to &s;ubmit; and to leave his &s;on, and brother, as pledges of his faith.</P>
<P>This act of perfidy rou&s;ed all the &s;pirit of Macdonald. The affair of Invernook-bay was forgotten. The quarrel was now his own. But being as cool, as he was determined, not the &s;lighte&s;t whi&s;per of di&s;content pa&s;&s;ed his lips. All appearance of re&s;entment was &s;tifled, till he could &s;hew it with effect.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary, it &s;eems, for Maclean in per&s;on to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e lands, which had thus been ceded to him. He
<PB N="195" REF="228">
went therefore to Ilay, and encamped his little company upon the ruins of a fort, near the Kinnes, which was the name of the lands, he was going to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>It was a cu&s;tom among the highland chiefs to invite all &s;trangers to their hou&s;es; and make them welcome, as long as their pro|vi&s;ion la&s;ted. When this was con&s;umed, the ma&s;ter of the family accompanied them to his next neighbour's, where their vi&s;it was limit|ed by the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity. This chief al&s;o join|ed the proce&s;&s;ion; and thus they went on, increa&s;ing their company, and devouring the provi&s;ions of a whole di&s;trict.</P>
<P>Of this jovial cu&s;tom, and the inconvenient &s;ituation of the camp of Kinnes, Macdonald took the advantage. He offered Maclean the u&s;e of his own habitation at Mullintrea; and de&s;cribing his neighbours, as di&s;po&s;ed to mirth and jollity, wi&s;hed him to pay a friend|ly vi&s;it among them: ob&s;erving, that his retinue, which was numerous, and e&s;pecially his ho&s;tages, would effectually &s;ecure him from any affront.</P>
<P>Credulity is as much the characteri&s;tic of a &s;tate of barbari&s;m, as &s;u&s;picion. Maclean with little he&s;itation complied; and &s;crupled
<PB N="196" REF="229">
not to accept an invitation from a man, with whom he had ju&s;t before broken every rite of ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>But other thoughts than tho&s;e of merriment po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mind of Macdonald. He had privately &s;ent orders to his clan to rendezvous in arms, at an appointed place; and at mid|night to &s;urround a hou&s;e, which he had appropriated for the reception of Maclean.&mdash; The habitation of a highland chief was a little town, con&s;i&s;ting of various appendages; many of which were detached.</P>
<P>The carou&s;al, which had purpo&s;ely been prolonged to a late hour, was now over; all were retired to re&s;t; and the highland-clan had taken their appointed &s;tand around the lodgings of Maclean, when Macdonald in a peremptory tone calling loud at the window of his gue&s;t, ordered him to come down. The alarmed chief &s;tarted from his bed; and &s;eeing through the lattice, the hou&s;e &s;urrounded by armed men, he cur&s;ed his own imprudence, gave up all for lo&s;t, and opened the door, holding the young &s;on of Macdonald, his ho&s;tage, before his brea&s;t, to prevent any &s;udden attack. But Macdonald a&s;&s;ured him, that nothing again&s;t his life was intended.
<PB N="197" REF="230">
The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his per&s;on was all he de&s;ired, and having obtained this, he proclaimed liberty to all the re&s;t of Maclean's followers. Two of them only were excepted, who were thought to have been their chief's principal advi&s;ers. With the&s;e Macdonald made &s;hort work, ordering fire to the out-hou&s;e in which they lodged, and leaving them to peri&s;h in the flames.</P>
<P>Maclean had &s;carce taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dungeon, when a plot nearer home was contrived to compleat his ruin. One of his near relations, Allen Maclean, thinking this a favourable opportunity to &s;erve his own intere&s;t, &s;pread a report that Maclean had &s;ent &s;ecret orders to put Macdonald's brother to death, who had been left as an ho&s;tage in Mull. In con&s;equence of this he hoped, that Macdonald would retaliate upon his pri&s;oner; while he him&s;elf, being pre|pared, might &s;eize the e&s;tate. His contrivance mi&s;carried in it's principal aim; tho it had horrid con&s;equences. Macdonald believing the report, ma&s;&s;acred in his rage all the retinue of Maclean, above eighty men, who had not yet left the i&s;land. Maclean him&s;elf
<PB N="198" REF="231">
he &s;pared, re&s;erving him probably for a more exemplary puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The &s;uperiority of Macdonald in this con|te&s;t, and his own per&s;onal abilities, began now to rai&s;e the jealou&s;y of the little court of Inverary. The territories of Kintire, which lay upon the &s;hores of Loch-Fyne, were contiguous to tho&s;e of Argyle; and the large i&s;land of Ilay, which belonged al&s;o to Macdonald, was immediately upon the coa&s;t. The&s;e in&s;ular po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions gave him the con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">quence of a maritime power: he had a navy in his ports, and could have carried a &s;udden war up Loch-Fyne to the very walls of In|verary. So potent a neighbour therefore became matter of ju&s;t alarm. Many councils were called, and it was at length, re&s;olved to rai&s;e a body of forces, o&s;ten&s;ively to adju&s;t the quarrel between the&s;e contending chiefs, but really to check the power of Macdonald.</P>
<P>The earl of Argyle however &s;oon found he had embarked in a matter above his &s;trength. Macdonald had addre&s;s in council, and abilities in the field, beyond the barbari&s;m of the times, in which he lived; and put on &s;o re&s;olute a countenance, that Argyle thought it prudent to draw back. His attempts took
<PB N="199" REF="232">
a &s;afer channel. He made an application to the king, whom by certain arguments he induced to come forward in the affair. James the &s;ixth, who was then king of Scotland, menaced in his u&s;ual tone of magnificence: but a highland chief, tho of a &s;econdary order, would not ea&s;ily at that day, &s;ubmit to a royal mandate, when i&s;&s;ued from &s;uch a prince as James.</P>
<P>It happened however that Macdonald was him&s;elf at this time di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ettle his dif|ference with Maclean. He had ju&s;t engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t the quarrel of a neighbouring chief upon the coa&s;t of Ireland; and wi&s;hed to tran&s;port him&s;elf into that country, as &s;oon as he could. On &s;ome rigid conditions therefore; and the delivery of &s;everal ho&s;tages; Maclean was &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>Neither prudence, fore&s;ight, nor contrivance, mark the events of &s;avage war: every man &s;eizes his prey, like a wild-bea&s;t, either by open force, or by a &s;udden &s;pring, when it is off it's guard. He con&s;iders not, whether he is able to maintain the quarrel. He begins it with temerity, and thinks not beyond the fir&s;t attack.&mdash;Thus Macdonald had no &s;ooner embarked for Ireland, than Maclean incited probably by the coun&s;el, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
<PB N="200" REF="233">
Argyle, entered Ilay with fire and &s;word. He had every rea&s;on to believe, that Macdonald would put his ho&s;tages to in&s;tant death: but he gave up every motive to the gratification of revenge.</P>
<P>Macdonald however with unu&s;ual gener|o&s;ity, &s;corned to revenge a public quarrel upon a few unfortunate individuals. The innocent blood he &s;hed at Mullintrea, had probably taught him this le&s;&s;on of humanity. But he was rapid in taking open vengeance. He in&s;tantly tran&s;ported his troops from Ire|land into the i&s;le of Mull, which he burned, ravaged, and de&s;troyed from one end to the other. The clan Lean could make no re|&s;i&s;tance, flying before him like &s;heep; whom the raging chief &s;ometimes &s;laughtered in a &s;cattered pur&s;uit; and &s;ometimes driving them in bodies into corners of the i&s;land, butchered in a promi&s;cuous heap. Cattle and every thing of value he carried off; and left the place &s;moking under the effects of his vengeance. <HI>Nullum in barbaris &s;aevitiae genus omittit ira, et victoria</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacitus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="234">Maclean, in the mean time, was not back|ward in retaliating; but finding him&s;elf un|able to cope with the prowe&s;s of Macdonald, he had, as u&s;ual, recour&s;e to perfidy.</P>
<P>John Macean, of the kindred of Macdonald, had, in peaceable times, expre&s;&s;ed a great at|tachment to Maclean's mother, who was then a blooming widow. The di&s;po&s;al of a mo|ther in marriage, was, it &s;eems, among the privileges of a highland-chief; and Maclean was eager to bring on this match, in expecta|tion, that it might be the mean of alluring his new father-in-law into a confderacy again&s;t Macdonald. Macean heard with plea&s;ure, that his propo&s;als would be accepted; and came to Mull with great joy, where the marriage was &s;olemnized. But after the nup|tials, when Maclean &s;ounded him about a league again&s;t Macdonald, the propo&s;al was received with di&s;dain. Macean would not hear of acting &s;o perfidious a part again&s;t his friend, his patron, and his near relation.</P>
<P>In revenge for this di&s;appointment, Mac|lean, with a brutality almo&s;t unparalleled, broke at midnight into Macean's chamber, tore him from his bride, put him to death;
<PB N="202" REF="235">
and killed eighteen of his men, who ran to a&s;&s;i&s;t their chief.</P>
<P>Barbarous as the country was, an act like this was received with horror. The ma&s;&s;a|cre at Mullintrea had thrown no odium on Mac|donald. He was pitied for a mi&s;take. But <HI>Macean's nuptials</HI> became a proverb to expre&s;s every thing that was vile, and &s;hocking in human nature.</P>
<P>This horrid deed &s;eemed the expiring act of de&s;pair. The credit, which Maclean had lo&s;t, accrued of cour&s;e to Macdonald; and all Scotland acknowledged the inequality of the conte&s;t between them. The king &s;aw it with concern; and con&s;idered the chief who pre&s;&s;|ed before his peers, as di&s;turbing the balance of the ari&s;tocracy, and tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the royal authority.</P>
<P>In this light Macdonald appeared at court; where James, incited by &s;u&s;picion, and jea|lou&s;y, determined to curb his influence. That prince, ever inclined to an oblique path, in&s;tead of boldly calling the man to account (as he might legally have done) who in the open defiance of law, dur&s;t pre&s;ume to re|venge his own quarrel; had recour&s;e to an act of perfidy. He pretended great zeal to &s;erve
<PB N="203" REF="236">
two kin&s;men, who ought to be &s;o dear to each other: he cajoled them with the kinde&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, and gave each of them a &s;afe conduct to Edinburgh, where he promi&s;ed to make up the matter to the &s;atisfaction of both. The method he took to &s;ettle their differences, if we except the perfidy of it, was &s;en&s;ible enough. He &s;hut them both up together in Edinburgh-ca&s;tle; and left them to manage the di&s;pute by them&s;elves. This conference brought affairs to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue. The two chiefs tired of their com|pany, and confinement, made the king every promi&s;e he de&s;ired; and to recover their li|berty, left their &s;ons as ho&s;tages for their fu|ture behaviour.</P>
<P>A peace during &s;everal years en&s;ued. But the highland quarrel of tho&s;e days was never worn out. Macdonald growing old, and leaving the management of his affairs to his &s;on, who was a mere youth, the revenge and ambition of Maclean again took fire. He got his old claims on Ilay confirmed, and enlarged, by a new grant from the crown; and at the head of his clan entered the i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="237">Young Macdonald, hearing of his prepar|ations, rai&s;ed forces likewi&s;e; and appeared in Ilay at the &s;ame time. Great endeavours were made by their common friends to prevent blood-&s;hed; and young Macdonald offered to give up half the di&s;puted lands, rather than have his father's age di&s;turbed: but Maclean reject|ed the offer, and proudly bad him prepare for battle.</P>
<P>At the head of a &s;mall lake, called Groinart, the&s;e two little highland-bodies were drawn up; and began one of tho&s;e de&s;perate conflicts, which is &s;eldom &s;een among regular troops. Maclean's party were more numerous; but Macdonald's were better &s;oldiers, having been trained in the Iri&s;h wars, and long inured to di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>The event of the battle was favourable to Macdonald. By a feigned retreat, that young chief di&s;ordered the enemy, and wheeling &s;uddenly round, charged them with &s;uch un|expected fury, that after a brave, tho ineffec|tual defence, they gave way. A great &s;laugh|ter en&s;ued. Three hundred were left dead upon the field; near eighty of whom were of the kindred of Maclean; and the dead body
<PB N="205" REF="238">
of that re&s;tle&s;s, and perfidious chief him&s;elf was found amid&s;t the carnage.</P>
<P>Before Maclean engaged in this enterprize he con&s;ulted one of the weird &s;i&s;ters of tho&s;e uninlightened times; and was an&s;wered, that if he landed in Ilay on a thur&s;day; or drank of a well near Groinart, he waged a war with fate. Both the&s;e injunctions he tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. A &s;torm drove him upon the coa&s;t on a thur&s;day; and he drank of the well before he had inquired the name of the place.</P>
<P>Thus ended, this long di&s;pute between the Madonalds, and the Macleans; and it ended as the di&s;putes of tho&s;e times commonly did, in the death of one of the contending parties.</P>
<P>Victory however did not &s;ecure repo&s;e to the brave Macdonald. Other conte&s;ts en|&s;ued. The death of Maclean had thrown &s;o much power into his hands, that it ex|cited anew the jealou&s;y and ambition of the earl of Argyle. That protent chief got a grant from the crown, as was u&s;ual in tho&s;e days, of the di&s;puted lands both in Kintire, and in Ilay, which Macdonald now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. This produced a new &s;eries of wars, which la&s;ted many years, between the Campbells,
<PB N="206" REF="239">
and the Macdonalds. Old Angus Macdonald was dead; but tho his &s;on inherited his virtues, the power of the hou&s;e of Inverary at length prevailed; and the lands in di&s;pute were finally annexed to it's va&s;t domains.</P>
<P>This narrative places in a &s;trong light, the character of tho&s;e barbarous times&mdash;the &s;pirit of ari&s;tocratic chiefs&mdash;and the exten&s;ive mi&s;chief of their quarrels, which were continually raging in &s;ome part of Scotland. In the mean time the lower members of each little community were as frequently making depredations on their neighbours in a lower &s;tyle; and often indeed under the influence of their chiefs, who inriched them&s;elves at the hazard of their va&s;&s;als, or made them the in&s;truments of &s;ome act of vengeance, in which they did not care to appear openly them&s;elves. When the chief did not want the &s;ervices of his clan, they pillaged for them&s;elves. It was no uncommon thing, we are told, for a father to give as a dowry with his daughter, what he could plunder in three Michaelmas moons.</P>
<P>The arts of rapine generated the arts of defence. Cattle were the great objects of
<PB N="207" REF="240">
plunder; and many ingenious modes of &s;ecur|ing them were practi&s;ed. Among the&s;e arts we are told wonderful &s;tories of the &s;agacity of the highlanders in tracing their cattle. They could di&s;tingui&s;h the track of their own bea&s;ts from any other&mdash;either by their number &mdash;or by their different ages&mdash;or by &s;ome other &s;igns we are ignorant of; and would pur&s;ue it through the territories of different clans, with the certainty of hounds following their game. Whenever the track was lo&s;t, the owner of the land was obliged to recover it: and if he could not, he was &s;ued for the damage. This plea had by long cu&s;tom obtained the force of law.</P>

<P>HAVING thus &s;hewn the unfavourable &s;ide of the highland character, let us con&s;ider it next in a more plea&s;ing light. The whole &s;y&s;tem of manners indeed which belongs to it, is now wholly changed. You may travel through any part of Scotland; and rarely hear of an atrocious deed. Con|tention among the chiefs is &s;ub&s;ided; and theft, and rapine among the inferior orders are at an end.</P>
<P>There are very few in&s;tances, in the annals of human nature of a country &s;o &s;uddenly reclaimed. After the battle of Culloden, when the &s;overeignty of the highland chiefs was aboli&s;hed by act of parliament, this happy change immediately took place.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="242">But yet, wi&s;e as this mea&s;ure was, it would have an&s;wered no end in reclaiming the man|ners of the people, if they had not been naturally of a virtuous ca&s;t. They thieved not &s;o much from principle, as through the force of clan&s;hip. When this was aboli&s;hed, the hone&s;t principles of nature revived. And yet it is very certain, that the prohibition of theft, and rapine among barbarous nations makes no part of their moral code. From the times of the ancient Greeks, to the pre&s;ent Arabs, the inva&s;ion of another's pro|perty was never con&s;idered as having any criminality in it; tho one would obviou&s;ly be apt to &s;uppo&s;e, that ju&s;tice &s;hould be among the fir&s;t principles of nature. At this very day, the young Circa&s;&s;ian prince is taught by his preceptor to ride, to u&s;e his arms, to &s;teal, and to conceal his thefts. The word <HI>thief</HI> is a term of the utmo&s;t reproach; but only as it implies detection. He is afterwards led to more con&s;iderable, and dangerous rob|beries; till his cunning, his addre&s;s, and &s;trength are &s;uppo&s;ed to be perfect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ellis's account of the Cauca&s;ian nations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="243">The Scotch highlander was greatly addicted al&s;o to revenge: and carried his quarrels, (as we have ju&s;t &s;een), to the la&s;t extremity. But for this we can ea&s;ily account: it was chiefly through a de&s;ire to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice; and to repair wrongs, for which the law, but weakly executed, would give him no redre&s;s. This we &s;ee verified in the narra|tive I have ju&s;t given. But one of the &s;tronge&s;t illu&s;trations of this remark, is a &s;tory told of James Hamilton, who a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated the regent Murray<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 74.</NOTE>. After the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, Ha|milton fled into France; where party then raged high. A per&s;on there, who knew him, and who wi&s;hed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the admiral Coligny; but had not re&s;olution to perpetrate the deed him&s;elf; thought he could not apply to a properer man, than Hamilton, who had ju&s;t committed an act of the &s;ame kind in his own country. Hamilton &s;hocked at the pro|po&s;al, cried out; "What! Villain, do you &s;uppo&s;e me an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in?" and challenged him on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the pronene&s;s of the Scotch highlander to acts of revenge, and
<PB N="212" REF="244">
rapine, he was, in other re&s;pects, in the wor&s;t of times, a virtuous character. He was faithful, ho&s;pitable, temperate, and brave; and if he did not ea&s;ily forget an injury; he was always e&s;teemed grateful for a benefit. How &s;trict he was where confidence was repo&s;ed, appears in a very &s;trong light from that univer&s;al protection and fidelity, which the pretender experienced after the battle of Culloden. Tho the penalty for concealing him was &s;o great; and the reward for giving him up &s;o tempting; there was not a &s;ingle man &s;ound among &s;uch numbers whom he was obliged to tru&s;t, who did not contribute all he could to conceal, and &s;uccour him. A fellow of the name of Kennedy, to whom he was particularly obliged, is often mentioned. This man had virtue enough to re&s;i&s;t the temptation of &pound; 30,000, tho he was afterwards hanged, I have heard, for &s;tealing a cow. We are told al&s;o of a very celebrated robber of the name of Roy M'greggor, who even formed thieving into a &s;cience; and yet was one of the mo&s;t benevolent men in the country; and remarkable for his many acts of kindne&s;s, and friend&s;hip.&mdash;There appears to be therefore in the Scotch highlander, notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="213" REF="245">
blemi&s;hes in his national character, a good foundation of moral virtue. A &s;purious kind of religion he always had: but it di&s;turbed the career of none of his pa&s;&s;ions. It &s;truck no root in his heart; but appeared only in a few wild &s;hoots of &s;uper&s;tition. He was a religious ob&s;erver, for in&s;tance, of his oath: but it was only when he had &s;worn by &s;ome|thing, which for &s;ome whim&s;ical rea&s;on he deemed &s;acred; his dagger perhaps, or his father's &s;oul: but he would break an oath, taken on a bible, without &s;cruple.</P>
<P>A better direction hath now been given to minds thus in a degree prepared by &s;uper&s;tition. King George the &s;econd gave, out of the forfeited e&s;tates, &pound; 1000 a year, which is &s;till continued, to erect &s;chools&mdash;to tran&s;late the bible into Er&s;e&mdash;and to maintain mini&s;ters, and catechi&s;ts. The good effects of this bounty are very vi&s;ible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It hath done a great deal; but Mr. Knox, in his <HI>Tour through the Highlands, and Hebride I&s;les,</HI> tells us, that much re|mains yet to be done; and that the difficulties, which he enu|merates, of the mi&s;&s;ionary preachers, are exceedingly great.</NOTE>. Through the whole country we found not only a plea&s;ing &s;implicity, and civility of manners; but a &s;erious, and religious
<PB N="214" REF="246">
deportment among the common people, which can hardly be conceived by tho&s;e, who are acquainted with the prophanene&s;s and pro|fligacy of the lower ranks near the capital. A &s;mall Er&s;e bible is the highlander's u&s;ual companion; and it is common to &s;ee him reading it, as he tends his cattle, or re&s;ts upon the road. We had frequently this plea&s;ing &s;ight. It is common al&s;o, when you enter his little cottage, to &s;ee the mother &s;pinning, or knitting, and the children &s;tand|ing round either reading in the bible; or repeating their catechi&s;m.</P>
<P>To this virtuous di&s;po&s;ition of the high|lander may be added, what commonly accom|panies a virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, an independent &s;pi|rit. There are no poor-rates in Scotland; and indeed a relief of that kind would be but ill-reli&s;hed in the country. While the Engli&s;h pea&s;ant will often forge pretences to live on the labour of others; the Scotch highlander, even in his real di&s;tre&s;&s;es, will make his la&s;t effort, and &s;ubmit to any inconvenience, before he will complain.</P>
<P>To the&s;e remarks on the pre&s;ent character of the Scotch highlander I &s;hall &s;ubjoin a plea&s;ing picture of dome&s;tic life, both as an
<PB N="215" REF="247">
illu&s;tration of what I have &s;aid; and as a contra&s;t to the bloody &s;cenes I pre&s;ented a little above. It is taken from a book of poems, which I have ju&s;t quoted, by Robert Burns, a bard as he calls him&s;elf, from the plough: but the images being caught from nature, are &s;uch as mu&s;t give plea&s;ure to every feeling heart. The whole indeed is equal to any prai&s;e.</P>

<L>The prie&s;t-like father reads the &s;acred page,</L>
<L>How Abram was the friend of God on high;</L>

<L>Perhaps the Chri&s;tian volume is the theme,</L>
