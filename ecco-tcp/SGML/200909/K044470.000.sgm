<P>THE Freedom of the Pre&s;s is our glory and palladium. It is, indeed, our national breath of exi&s;tence, as a free independent State. It is the Heart of the Body-politic, through which con&s;titutional Life circulates freely and vi|gorou&s;ly, giving &s;trength, exertion, and activity, to every member. When it is ob&s;tructed partial|ly, or totally de&s;troyed, di&s;ea&s;e, or death inevita|ble, en&s;ues. All nations, in proportion as they en|joy a FREE-PRESS, enjoy the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;|ings of per&s;onal Liberty, and proprietary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Some have it perfect and unlimited, for in&s;tance, BRITAIN, and BRITISH AMERICA: Britain and America are, therefore, perfectly and without limitation, a free people. Some in a qualified and di&s;cretionary degree, like France; who&s;e &s;ubjects accordingly ta&s;te the exqui&s;ite delights of Free|dom, ju&s;t as the ruling Powers are di&s;po&s;ed, from a well-conditioned though ever-varying &s;en&s;e of right and ju&s;tice, to fix the preci&s;e point of di&s;cre|tion
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
and qualification. Others, again, in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute terms of de&s;potic prohibition, of which the Pontifical States are an example: Rome and Italy, of cour&s;e, are, at this pre&s;ent time, in the mo&s;t deplorable &s;tate of &s;tupified ignorance, and brow-fallen &s;ubjection, a &s;tate infinitely wor&s;e than if they had not exi&s;ted as a people at all.</P>
<P>From this &s;hort repre&s;entation it is plain, that no people now upon earth are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Freedom, in any &s;en&s;e worthy of Men and Chri&s;tians, but BRITONS, in which term I would comprehend Great-Britain and Ireland, America, and all their widely &s;pread dependancies, now (alas!) in a vio|lent convul&s;ive &s;tate of being torn and rent a&s;under, by the councils and machinations of wicked and abandoned men!&mdash;Wonderful and di&s;honourable tale! that nine parts of ten, of our habitable globe, &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ively and patiently worn away the progre&s;&s;ive &s;eries of more than <HI>fifty centuries,</HI> only to become the very rever&s;e of what God, the Crea|tor, intended Man to be! The contemplation of this &s;ubject plunges the human mind into a fa|thomle&s;s reverie, from which it never emerges, without that irre&s;i&s;tible influx of &s;trong &s;en&s;ibilities, the effect of which is always pain and deba&s;ement, beyond the picturation of words. E&s;pecially is the reflective philo&s;ophical &s;oul wounded in its feel|ings, when it is con&s;idered, that &s;o enormous a di&s;proportion of our &s;pecies all along &s;uffered them|&s;elves to be &s;unk into &s;o wretched and brutal a &s;tate, for the &s;ake of a <HI>few individuals</HI> (I mean kings) who in the gra&s;p of the people, had the people retained any portion of the Divinity among them, would have been no more than the cru&s;h of a midge under an elephant's foot.&mdash;A &s;ort of two-fold con&s;ideration tends to deepen and invete|rate this wound.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">Kings, for being &s;uch, far le&s;s to become ty|rants, had no original natural right whatever; no right, in &s;hort, exclu&s;ive of the free election of the People, but what the barbarian, the ruffian, the robber, and the murderer, may a&s;&s;ume. This matter is &s;et in a clear uncontrovertible light, in con&s;equence of knowing the will and appointment of Heaven. The will and appointment of Heaven, we, that are Chri&s;tians, and, what is more, Pro|te&s;tants, with the New Te&s;tament in our hands, know perfectly. Let it be premi&s;ed, that what latterly has been found the moral intentions of God, re&s;pecting the grand line of conduct among nations and individuals, was always the moral in|tentions of God, tho' not promulgated. Neither is the ju&s;tice of God impeachable here, for not promulgating them &s;ooner, by expre&s;s Revelation; becau&s;e the univer&s;al or endemic di&s;ea&s;e did not &s;ooner arrive at its cri&s;is to be cured; and becau&s;e, in reality, &s;uch a promulgation actually took place at the creation of Man; under the vigorous effect of which, it is well known, that for many &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive ages after our race had been created, the Pa|triarchal &s;tate of equality, or the &s;hepherd erratic &s;tate, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted and flouri&s;hed, without any &s;ubor|dination, but what &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and in the cour&s;e of things, re&s;ulted from parental &s;eniority, vener|able gravity, piety, wi&s;dom and experience.</P>
<P>True, matters altered for the wor&s;e very &s;oon; bad di&s;po&s;itions di&s;covered them&s;elves; bad habits were contracted; envy, avarice, jealou&s;y, and ambition, &s;eized on the human mind, as a &s;ort of prey; virtuous un&s;u&s;picious equality cea&s;ed, and Government, with its appending evils, and prone|ne&s;s to degenerate, began. The fir&s;t promulgated moral intentions of Heaven were, con&s;equently, &s;uperceded, declining gradually, till, at length,
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
they became totally forgotten, and ab&s;orpt in the abandoned vices and idolatry of the Heathen world.&mdash;But this brings not the Moral Law, fir&s;t imprinted on the heart of man, into di&s;pute; for the &s;ame objection lies again&s;t Revelation it&s;elf, which, in its &s;pirit and legi&s;lative government of the Chri&s;tian world, has been as much abu&s;ed, corrupted, neglected, and &s;et a&s;ide, as the Primary Law of Nature, the creational &s;tandard of conduct, ever was by the Heathen world.&mdash;Having, I hope, pretty clearly evinced this point; the will and ap|pointment of Heaven, with regard to the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of nations, remains to be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>In times po&s;terior to the Great Chri&s;tian Law|giver, our te&s;t and proof mu&s;t be taken from the Scriptures undoubtedly. CHRIST'S little kingdom, at fir&s;t, con&s;i&s;ted of him&s;elf and his twelve Apo&s;tles. Dictating in this kingdom, which will one day be &s;upreme over all, this is his explicit command, as conveying the will and appointment of Heaven throughout all generations. <HI>The princes of the Gentiles</HI> (Heathens, Pagans) <HI>exerci&s;e dominion over them, and they that are great, exerci&s;e authority up|on them: but it &s;hall not be &s;o among you; but who|&s;oever will be great among you, let him be your Mi|ni&s;ter; and who&s;oever will be chief among you, let him be your &s;ervant.</HI> Now, the point of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion here is, whether this remarkable precept, &s;o clear|ly expre&s;&s;ed, be a general, or a partial one; that is, comprehen&s;ive of Kings, Rulers, and Gover|nors, or barely re&s;tricted to individuals, in ob&s;cure, &s;ocial life: or to give it another face &s;till; whe|ther Emperors and Kings are not as &s;trictly and minutely bound down to the performance of all the Chri&s;tian virtues, of which mercy, placability, for|bearance, ju&s;tice, equity, truth, &s;elf-denial, and univer&s;al benevolence, are the principal, as the
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
meane&s;t of tho&s;e that are &s;tyled their &s;ubjects. Who dare affirm they are not? I dare affirm, however novel and unpopular the affirmation, they are. To admit the contrary involves conclu&s;ions, ruinous to the peace, welfare, and happine&s;s of &s;o|ciety. If Kings and Magi&s;trates are not included in the Chri&s;tian code of moral precepts, or have an indemnification, peculiar to their order, for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing them, then are tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, the ravages of countries and deva&s;tations of king|doms, carried forward, and needs mu&s;t be carried forward through all future ages, under the au&s;pices and protection of Heaven. An Alexander, a Nero, a Charles XII, a Lewis XIV, not to mention any more of the butchers and plunderers of the world, would have felt them&s;elves perfectly beatified in the thought.</P>
<P>But the argument need not be extended. God knows no artificial complex bodies; &s;uch bodies can have no identity, or re&s;pon&s;ibility, in the ag|gregate, in another world. A king will be judg|ed, not as a king, but as a man: his kingly acts were not appointed by God, but his acts as a man, are, on the contrary, the expre&s;s appointment of God, and are indi&s;pen&s;able. State nece&s;&s;ity, the <HI>arcana imperii,</HI> or the accommodable municipal law of nations, will not bring Kings off, any more than a critical urgent train of circum&s;tances, into the embarra&s;&s;ment of which he has voluntarily brought him&s;elf, will excu&s;e an individual guilty of violence, robbery or blood. The law of nati|ons, and the &s;ecrets and policy of &s;tates, are the in&s;titutions of mere men acting as their own law|givers, without precept or injunction from Heaven; therefore, can avail nothing as a ju&s;tification in in&s;tances where a &s;uperior law has been broken and trodden under foot.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="7">This is clearly the &s;tate of things on the great Chri&s;tian &s;cale of required duty; &s;o that, modern kings have but one alternative, in the mid&s;t of their a&s;toni&s;hing artificial greatne&s;s, either to deny they are Chri&s;tians, throw off the appellative altogether, or confe&s;s that the &s;ame &s;imple, pure, unaffected, di&s;intere&s;ted morality, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, is as much required from them, and tho&s;e they depute in authority under them, as from the very lowe&s;t of the people; tho&s;e they proudly call their &s;ub|jects and va&s;&s;als. Nor can a king, with any pro&s;|pect of being heard, retire to his clo&s;et to a&s;k God forgivene&s;s for his &s;ins, if he has, by the medium of his fleets and armies, &s;hed the blood of one man, or taken his property from him, wrongfully, not to mention the blood of thou&s;ands, perhaps, lying at his door, who&s;e gho&s;ts are now &s;oliciting re&s;ti|tution from, and vengeance upon him, in the in|vi&s;ible world.</P>
<P>Very true, he cannot be called to account in this life, except by another king, haply as flagiti|ous, bloody-minded, and inexorable as him&s;elf; while in the mean time, he is &s;urrounded and kept in countenance by his generals and &s;oldiers, his courtiers and clergy. What then? The&s;e with him&s;elf &s;hall, in the natural cour&s;e of things, be reduced to that du&s;t they now tread upon, as in|&s;ignificant in memory as the monarchs and mini|&s;ters of &s;tate before the flood.</P>
<P>A higher authority than any king's has &s;aid, <HI>Requite not evil, but rather return evil for good.</HI> This is addre&s;&s;ed to &s;overeigns, as well as to beg|gars; nor have I the &s;malle&s;t doubt, that &s;hould a king's duty as a Man, and a Chri&s;tian, e&s;&s;entially interfere with his duty as a king, or an elected head of a community, that he &s;hould unque&s;tion|ly prefer the fir&s;t to the la&s;t: And &s;hould it even
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
come to that grand deci&s;ive declaratory point, by which he mu&s;t either cea&s;e to be king, or wound his own con&s;cience by di&s;obeying God, however importunate the fa&s;tidious and &s;elf-created exigen|cies of a court might be that &s;hould impel him to act contrarily, he ought, undoubtedly, to re&s;ign his &s;ceptre and his crown, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that a mini&s;ter under him &s;hould give up his commi&s;&s;ion, and emoluments annexed, when any thing has been officially injoined him incon&s;i&s;tent with his ho|nour, virtue and integrity.&mdash;I believe, not one in|&s;tance of the former has occurred in the annals of our world, and of the latter, comparatively, very few. But the paucity, in either ca&s;e, e&s;tabli&s;hes no precedent. The &s;uperior exertions of di&s;inter|e&s;ted greatne&s;s, and heroic excellence, though &s;el|dom, very &s;eldom occurring, to ennoble our na|ture, are, notwith&s;tanding, &s;till within the requi&s;iti|ons of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>The de&s;truction of freedom, in &s;o many Chri&s;|tian kingdoms (I may &s;ay in all, except Great-Britain) the natural birthright of men, and in the defence of which taking the life of another is no crime, by princes and kings, is an accumulation of guilt upon <HI>their head,</HI> which they may &s;upport for a few years, by means of adventitious aids, but which mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly overwhelm them, when they &s;tand common naked &s;pirits in another world. The extinction of Freedom is the extinction of e|very noble, manly, generous virtue, as well as Chri&s;tian grace. All tyrants, therefore, have this additional guilt lying heavy on their &s;ouls, however in&s;en&s;ible they are of it. To deface the image of God in millions, and from day to day prevent them from recovering it, is an enormity of the fir&s;t mag|nitude, but it wants a name. Multitudes of ne|farious execrable deeds, in the primary move|ments of every &s;tate, according as it is more or
<PB N="x" REF="9">
le&s;s tyrannical, have no appropriate terms in our dictionaries. They are too black and horrid, and too indu&s;triou&s;ly hid behind Tartarian veils from the in&s;pection of the people, to be admitted into the language of humanity. But of all the deeds of darkne&s;s, and in&s;olent outrage on the privileges of mankind, to de&s;troy <HI>the Liberty of the Pre&s;s,</HI> is &s;urely the mo&s;t diabolical. It is laying an embargo on the human mind; &s;aying to its di|vine faculties, <HI>hitherto &s;hall ye come, and no farther.</HI> The &s;ame &s;pirit, were it competent to the act, would lay an embargo on the &s;un, and &s;ay to the heavenly brightener of our habitations, hitherto &s;halt thou come, proud luminary, and here &s;hall thy proud beams be &s;taid. Nay, the very air we breathe, in &s;weet and pure diffu&s;ion, could the &s;ame &s;pirit &s;top or confine its circulation, it malig|nantly would.</P>
<P>The fact, however, is this. What is ju&s;t, right, and fit, in England, is ju&s;t, right and fit, in France, Germany, Turky, and in all the kingdoms of the earth. Nations may be called great individuals under the eye of Nature's &s;overeign Lord, &s;ubject to eternal laws &s;uperior to them&s;elves, which they may not, on any pretence what&s;oever, relax, ac|commodate, or explain away, to &s;erve their own partial local circum&s;tances. Were &s;uch a pre-eminent immutable law &s;uppo&s;ed not to exi&s;t, let the intelligent reader mark the con&s;equences. E|very nation mu&s;t be con&s;idered as ab&s;olutely &s;upreme and infallible in it&s;elf, not with reference to man only, but with reference to God, the Creator of man. This ab&s;urdity is too mighty to be &s;wallow|ed. Another prepo&s;terous conclu&s;ion likewi&s;e fol|lows. The cu&s;toms, fa&s;hions, peculiarities, ca|prices, prejudices, &s;oil and climate, of different countries, would be ever varying the religion and virtue of each place; &s;o that men &s;hould have as
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
many &s;tandards independent on each other, of virtue and religion, as there are independent &s;tates; whereby truth and moral rectitude &s;hould become a mere political engine, a mere mini&s;terial ma|noeuvre of the &s;tate. Such unavoidable conclu&s;i|ons need only be barely mentioned, with the keene&s;t effect of ridicule to fla&s;h men in the face.</P>
<P>This ble&s;&s;ed deduction, however, which ought to afford &s;uch comfort, and not ignoble triumph, to every Briti&s;h bo&s;om, would amply &s;oothe the writer's trouble, had he taken more to expo&s;e them. Need he mention it? Every grateful freeborn Briton will at the in&s;tant anticipate it in his thoughts. It is this, that wherever de&s;poti&s;m, dark &s;ullen de&s;poti&s;m, &s;lavery, and oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;ub&s;i&s;t now in Europe, THERE <HI>the liberty of the pre&s;s</HI> is de&s;troyed, ab&s;olutely annihilated. A &s;tigma of inef|fable infamy on all tyrants, had they time to be &s;truck with it, from the indulgence of their vices and &s;en&s;ualities: &mdash; they can only make men &s;laves by keeping them in impenetrable darkne&s;s and ig|norance, no remove from in&s;tinctive tamene&s;s, and be&s;tial &s;tupidity. As &s;oon as ever men a&s;cend a de|gree above bea&s;ts of burden, and brutes that feed on gra&s;s, in happy light and knowledge, they be|gin to be con&s;cious of &s;elf-dignity; feel the long &s;mothered fire of heaven, the incitements of im|mortality, &s;tir in their bo&s;oms; look upon their ty|rant oppre&s;&s;ors and tax-ma&s;ters, with indignant and di&s;dainful eye dragging them to in&s;tant account, as delinquents of the mo&s;t capital atrociou&s;ne&s;s, though pavilioned in all the terror and awfulne&s;s of maje&s;ty and empire.</P>
<P>Pre&s;cient of what mon&s;ters kings would eventu|ally turn out, as free agents, in the progre&s;s of time, is it any wonder that God repeatedly refu&s;ed a king to <HI>his own people,</HI> the Jews, and that when
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
he was importuned by Samuel to grant them one, the gift was tacked with his <HI>hot di&s;plea&s;ure,</HI> and with the denunciation of endle&s;s woes and mi&s;e|ries that unavoidably mu&s;t accompany it? The lan|guage of Heaven is &s;o &s;trong, declaratory, point|ed, and irre&s;i&s;tible, that the writer, in &s;elf-vindi|cation, cannot but tran&s;cribe it here. <HI>Now there|fore</HI> (&s;ays God to Samuel) <HI>hearken unto their voice</HI> (the voice of the people) <HI>howbeit, prote&s;t &s;olemnly unto them the manner of the king that &s;hall rule over them.</HI> THIS SHALL BE THE MANNER OF THE KING THAT SHALL RULE OVER THEM.&mdash;<HI>He will take your &s;ons and appoint them for him&s;elf, for his chariots, and to be his hor&s;emen, and &s;ome &s;hall run before his chariots: and he will appoint him cap|tains over thou&s;ands, and captains over fifties; and will &s;et them to till his ground, and to reap his har|ve&s;ts, and to make his in&s;truments of war, and in|&s;truments of his chariots: and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers: and he will take your fields, and your olive yards, even the be&s;t of them, and give them to his &s;ervants: and he will take the tenth of your &s;eed, and of your vineyards, and give them to his officers and to his &s;ervants: and he will take the tenth of your men &s;ervants, and your maid &s;ervants, and your goodlie&s;t young men, and your a&s;&s;es, and put them to his work: and he will take the tenth of your &s;heep, and ye &s;hall be his &s;ervants;</HI> AND YE SHALL CRY OUT IN THAT DAY, BECAUSE OF THE KING WHICH YE SHALL HAVE CHOSEN, AND THE LORD WILL NOT HEAR YOU IN THAT DAY.&mdash;</P>
<P>Modern monarchy and tyranny, wherever they are a&s;&s;ociated, are here depicted to the life; in|deed, &s;o perfectly exact and literal, that no mortal can mi&s;take the prophetic de&s;cription and fulfil|ment. Perhaps, not one in a thou&s;and has at|tended

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING what has been writ|ten, by the inqui&s;itive, the ingenious, the learned, and the indu&s;trious, on American affairs, and that mo&s;t people think the &s;ubject exhau&s;ted, to me it appears (I have no vanity on the occa&s;ion) there are <HI>two con&s;iderations</HI> hitherto untouched, that tend to throw a deci&s;ive air on the whole: that is, if we take our rule of judgment from fir&s;t principles, original rights, and general rectitude, confirmed and illu&s;trated by that excellent mora|lity delivered to us in Revelation, and not from the narrowed corporational maxims of a particular &s;tate or kingdom, even with admired and idolized <HI>patrioti&s;m</HI> on our-&s;ide, which mu&s;t always give place to humanity, and reverence for Heaven. Nor do I think it would reflect any di&s;credit on the great|e&s;t monarch, or greate&s;t &s;tate&s;man, to be in&s;tructed in his duty from Heaven, le&s;s than the meane&s;t private individual: but &s;urely it realizes a di&s;grace on modern times not to be gilded over or conceal|ed, that the grand movements of government are now conducted on the &s;ame confined, partial, mer|cenary, de&s;potic, unju&s;t, cruel &s;cale, that was the &s;tandard of Pagan times and Heatheni&s;h manners; nay, I will be bold to affirm, on a wor&s;e &s;cale in many particulars. Our European kings are now called Chri&s;tian, and many of them have pompous Chri&s;tian epithets appended to their armorial titles: Is there any idea annexed to the term Chri&s;tian?
<PB N="21" REF="20">
Or is it a mere convenient de&s;ignation of popular honour to flouri&s;h at a market-cro&s;s, in the mouth of an herald or king at arms? Our MOST CHRIS|TIAN KINGS are as little Chri&s;tian, except in the raree-&s;how of public wor&s;hip, bordering upon ido|latry and romance, impo&s;ed upon them by fellow mortals, as any that reigned a thou&s;and years be|fore Chri&s;t. From &s;uch premi&s;es we mu&s;t not draw our conclu&s;ions; from &s;uch models we mu&s;t not fini&s;h our copies. There is a &s;tandard beyond the etiquette of a court, the records of Parliament, or the &s;ecreted &s;chedules of a Cabinet Council, that will always determine the true philo&s;ophical politi|cian, or political philo&s;opher. By this &s;tandard, the &s;tandard of humanity, inforced by Chri&s;tian ethics, the following pages mu&s;t be judged, as, indeed, it is confe&s;&s;ed, they cannot abide any other. I have no object but the e&s;tabli&s;hment and elucidation of truth, as leaning on general primary axioms, not on mere territorial authority, and Machiavelian u&s;age. I have no lucrative expecta|tions from any per&s;on in power, nor would I ac|cept of remuneration from any government upon earth, in the light of a hireling pen&s;ioned writer. I am in a profe&s;&s;ionary &s;ituation to <HI>live.</HI> What can a monarch or his prime mini&s;ter &s;ay more? Let my judges be the &s;pecies at large, let me have an appeal to Heaven, and let Lord North try me when he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>While &s;omething more tremendou&s;ly definitive than &s;peculation, is now carrying on between the principals in the grand conte&s;t, the &s;ons of lei&s;ure and literature may be indulged in the exerci&s;e of the pen; un&s;upported and un&s;anctified by which, the &s;word, even &s;uppo&s;ing a Cae&s;ar, or an Alexan|der to wield it, had better have repo&s;ed in its &s;cab|bard, covered with ru&s;t, and edgele&s;s from di&s;u&s;e.
<PB N="22" REF="21">
The longe&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t &s;word may precipitate all things before it in this world. But what is this world in compari&s;on with exi&s;tence to come? No more than a hillock of ants in the front of a &s;ul|tan's palace, or in the mid&s;t of his gardens, de|&s;troying one another, did ants de&s;troy one another like men. The &s;word forms no defence in a fu|ture world, nor is it admitted as evidence. Even upon earth a man with a &s;word in his hand would not be &s;uffered to approach a bar of ju&s;tice or a&s;|&s;ize. No! he mu&s;t there appear di&s;armed, if any per&s;on can be &s;aid to be di&s;armed, who tru&s;ts his cau&s;e to judicial trial, on the manly principles of right rea&s;on, and convincing argument. But not to lo&s;e &s;ight of the two con&s;iderations we &s;et out with; let them be mentioned.&mdash;They are the&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Parliaments cannot be &s;upreme in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, without being infallible al&s;o. Se|condly, Colonies when they find them&s;elves able, that is, <HI>come of age,</HI> may, in con&s;equence of an una|nimity, nay a majority of voices, throw off all &s;ub|jection to the originating parent Sate, a power de|rived from God, and authorized by the nece&s;&s;ity of things. To &s;uppo&s;e the negative of either of the&s;e, would be to &s;uppo&s;e contradictions admi&s;&s;i|ble.&mdash;Of the&s;e in their order.</P>
<P>Till it is impo&s;&s;ible for Parliaments to err, to be tyrannical, to be cruel and unju&s;t, the ab&s;olute &s;u|premacy of Parliament is&mdash;<HI>vox et preterea nihil.</HI> A word indeed of infinite &s;onorous energy in the mouth of him who&s;e highe&s;t ambition looks but upward to a place, or who wi&s;hes to pre&s;erve the place he has already got. But witne&s;&s;es of this kind are to be accounted partial and &s;uborned.&mdash;Since then it is po&s;&s;ible for Parliaments to err (all hi&s;to|rical evidence proves it) it follows of cour&s;e, that a power to detect that error exi&s;ts &s;omewhere in
<PB N="23" REF="22">
the aggregate body. Otherwi&s;e one error, how fatal &s;oever e&s;teemed, would beget another, and yet another, until the con&s;titution &s;hould actually fall by the hands of its own guardians and protec|tors. But who is to judge of the emergency? The party aggrieved doubtle&s;s. Suppo&s;ing, how|ever, <HI>that</HI> party incon&s;iderable. What is to be done? Why it mu&s;t &s;ubmit merely from nece&s;&s;ity and the duty of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation; but with an abiding con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having been deeply in|jured, connected with the con&s;olation of a future appeal, where arbitrary inforcement, and &s;uperior numbers, avail nothing, unle&s;s it be to give aggra|vation to offence, and crim&s;on to guilt. Farther, admitting the party aggrieved nearly on a par with the high-handed in&s;olent aggre&s;&s;ors; in &s;uch a ca&s;e, all the laws of God and man authorize a &s;pirit of defence, re&s;i&s;tance, repul&s;e, and repri&s;al. If un|&s;ucce&s;sful in the attempt, the want of &s;ucce&s;s by no means tends to infer delinquency, rather indeed the contrary in mo&s;t ca&s;es, as people unworthily di&s;po&s;ed always wi&s;h to carry by numbers and dra|gooning violence what they are well aware the ju&s;|tice and integrity of their cau&s;e could never effec|tuate.</P>
<P>This latent unrepre&s;&s;ible &s;pirit pervading the &s;e|veral parts of a mighty empire, is in truth its ba|&s;is and &s;ecurity. For did not the governing pow|ers decree and act, under the intimidation and eventual interference of a <HI>greater</HI> power <HI>in diffu&s;o,</HI> every &s;tate would become de&s;potic, and every Prince a tyrant. The very freedom of a &s;tate is a &s;tanding recognition, a tacit acknowledgment, of a mightier power than the governing and the legi|&s;lative, exi&s;ting in the body of the people. In this &s;en&s;e, the common adage&mdash;<HI>vox populi, vox Dei</HI>&mdash; has both &s;ignificance and propriety.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">According to this repre&s;entation, it is plain, that only de&s;potic governments can, in any appro|priate &s;en&s;e, be called &s;upreme or infallible, that is to &s;ay, irreprehen&s;ible and uncontroulable by any cotemporary power upon earth; for could their legi&s;lation be reprehended and controuled, they &s;hould not any longer be de&s;potic, but free.&mdash;To draw matters to a point.</P>
<P>Great Britain is a free popular &s;tate. This is acknowledged on all hands, and remains an in|&s;tance of her con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, per&s;evering virtue and heroi&s;m, truly re&s;pectable and venera|ble. Her freedom and popularity then, amid&s;t &s;urrounding arbitrary nations, &s;erve as an illu&s;tri|ous and irrefragable proof, that her legi&s;lation may be di&s;puted, and her executive powers re&s;i&s;ted, in many po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es. When they happen, every member of the empire (not to mention great pro|vincial divi&s;ions of it) has an undoubted right to judge for him&s;elf. If inadequate to the momen|tous ri&s;que of re&s;i&s;tance, to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice, af|ter every intermediate moderate &s;tep has been ta|ken in vain, he has a clear right to annihilate his connections with &s;uch a &s;tate, and commence a freeman in any latitude, or upon any &s;hore, more kindly to his pro&s;pects, and more congenial with his &s;entiments. God, the &s;upreme king and go|vernor of all nations, to whom monarchs are as &s;ubject as &s;laves, inve&s;ts him with this paramount privilege, from the &s;ame principle of benignity and fitne&s;s he has planted the &s;trong &s;en&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation in his brea&s;t, to avoid the tyger and the lion, when he finds him&s;elf unable to &s;ubdue either.&mdash;To throw one's &s;elf in the way of a lion or a tyger, when a method of e&s;cape pre&s;ents it|&s;elf, would not be gallantry or &s;pirit, but fool-har|dine&s;s and <HI>bedlamitei&s;m.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24">It is granted, people may often imagine them|&s;elves aggrieved with little or no rea&s;on, and that it is an heinous offence to di&s;turb the peace and tranquility of a &s;tate: but then, the po&s;&s;ibility of the rever&s;e becoming a nece&s;&s;itous duty, lays a foundation of contingent re&s;i&s;tance, even in the mo&s;t correct and guarded theory. I &s;hall beg leave to give an exemplification in point. Suppo&s;e Par|liament &s;hould conceive the idea, and put it into operation, of depriving a particular county of its two repre&s;entatives, yet neverthele&s;s continue to levy taxes and all public burdens upon its inhabi|tants; would not &s;uch a county have &s;ufficient cau&s;e to think it&s;elf mo&s;t injuriou&s;ly treated, and con&s;e|quentially authorized to run thro' all the mediums petitional of retributory redre&s;s, even undi&s;mayed by the la&s;t re&s;ort, in&s;urgency again&s;t its oppre&s;&s;ors, though no le&s;s high in official department, than high in the flagitiou&s;ne&s;s of offence? And if una|ble, with any probable views of &s;ucce&s;s, to carry matters in this way, would not the inhabitants of &s;uch a county merit the highe&s;t elogiums due to &s;pirit and magnanimity, &s;hould they nobly take the re&s;olution of removing their effects, and emi|grating beyond &s;eas, to a more ho&s;pitable and righ|teous clime, the &s;eat of common right and inde|pendence?&mdash;God, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, is the giver of property, and the great protector of property; to whom there lies an appeal from all mankind, how great &s;oever, when it is unju&s;tly and violently invaded, and to whom we mu&s;t be circum&s;tantially accountable for its u&s;e and abu&s;e, its embezzlement and pre&s;ervation; as property, aptly &s;ecured and judiciou&s;ly laid out, is effective of excellent ends and purpo&s;es in this world.

<P>Something of the &s;ame nature with the foregoing was actually &s;een to happen, not long ago, in Ire|land, re&s;pecting not a county alone, but a whole province, the province of Ul&s;ter. The Di&s;&s;enters, making by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable body in that province, without being either repre&s;ented, or having per&s;onal votes in ve&s;tries, were made &s;ub|ject to be taxed, by act of parliament, for the re|pairs and ornaments of churches (places of wor&s;hip again&s;t their con&s;ciences) at the di&s;cretion of peo|ple too much di&s;po&s;ed to hold them in durance and contempt. It is true, an act &s;o arbitrary, un|generous, and unmanly, was no proof of the &s;pi|rit of the times. It originated with a &s;ingle per|&s;on, a great eccle&s;ia&s;tic (eccle&s;ia&s;tics have always been at the bottom of &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion) and was &s;uffered to pa&s;s &s;omewhat unaccountably, through the negligence of &s;ome, and the &s;upine inattention of others, in which circum&s;tances mo&s;t dark and wicked &s;chemes are pu&s;hed into form.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">The Di&s;&s;enters to a man were irritated and alarmed, being con&s;cious of no defaulture. They had &s;everal meetings and con&s;ultations, touching the nece&s;&s;ity of declaring their united &s;entiments on &s;o critical an occa&s;ion, and at length unani|mou&s;ly agreed to petition Parliament. They did &s;o, from their re&s;pective pari&s;h di&s;tricts, in a de|cent, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, but able manner. The prayer of their petitions was heard by a &s;en&s;ible, libe|ral-minded majority in the Hou&s;e of Commons; the obnoxious act repealed, and peace and &s;ecurity re&s;tored to a va&s;t body of opulent, well-affected people; who, otherwi&s;e, might have been preci|pitated into that &s;pecies of ill-humour and di&s;con|tent which every wi&s;e government will always ap|pea&s;e and &s;oothe in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, where a u&s;e|ful and numerous &s;et of men are concerned.</P>
<P>Indeed it cannot but be ob&s;erved here, that the procedure of the governing powers, with reference to the Ve&s;try-Act, contradicted their general line of conduct in American affairs.

The o&s;ten&s;ible cau&s;e of the one, was the delinquency of a riotous mob in the town of Bo&s;ton; of the other, a refrac|tory di&s;po&s;ition &s;hewn by a few di&s;&s;enting congrega|tions, with regard to the repair of churches.

Political expedience connected with a particu|lar &s;y&s;tem, chiefly lucrative to men officially em|ployed, and general rectitude, involving the com|mon concerns of mankind, and referable to God as the &s;upreme arbiter and judge, are two di&s;tinct things; nor was it becoming a Chri&s;tian divine (he would be thought &s;o) to ground his deducti|ons on the former, and not on the latter. <HI>His</HI> deductions, indeed, they cannot be called. The Rev. <HI>John We&s;ley</HI> is a plagiary, without being ho|ne&s;t enough to apologize for it. Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> not only furni&s;hed him with his rea&s;onings (if &s;uch they may be called) but his language al&s;o. True, we are told <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Critical Reviewers would &s;creen him mo&s;t &s;hamefully, by alledging he could not find better thoughts or expre&s;&s;ions: an excu&s;e for all literary theft, even did a new &s;et of Review|ers ari&s;e, pilfer the Critical, and vend their monthly labours as their own.</NOTE> he could not adopt better on the &s;ide he
<PB N="39" REF="38">
took: but &s;hall a man counterfeit the current coin of a kingdom, from the circum&s;tance of his not having more valuable models to take his impre&s;&s;i|ons from? Nor was it a &s;eemly excu&s;e for robbing a great and growing people of their rights and franchi&s;es, that he had before robbed a celebrated author of his writings.&mdash;Our &s;econd Con&s;i|deration remains to be brought before the reader <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>It may not be improper to mention here, the outlines of two Gentlemen's opinions that have figured, but widely differed, in the di&s;pute between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> I mean EDMOND BURKE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Dr. TUCKER, <HI>Dean of Glouce&s;ter.</HI> Not|with&s;tanding the <HI>latter</HI> affects to de&s;pi&s;e the explo&s;ive effects of the <HI>former</HI>'s rhetorical thunder and lightning, the mo&s;t cur&s;ory reader cannot but remark, that the <HI>Rev. Dean</HI> found him&s;elf violently &s;corched by the one, and &s;onorou&s;ly rou&s;ed to wound|ed &s;elf-con&s;equence by the other. He expre&s;&s;es great deference for the Hou&s;e of Commons, and <HI>mode&s;tly</HI> hints his regret in en|tering on a que&s;tion then before that Hou&s;e; but re&s;pecting Mr. Burke, a member thereof, he profe&s;&s;edly loo&s;ens him&s;elf from all ceremony, and, indeed, would notably reduce him to a mere &s;enatorial mummy of &s;plendid diction, &s;imile, and meta|phor. Where is the Dean's decorum or con&s;i&s;tency here? It is not the Hou&s;e that covers the members, but the members that con&s;titute the Hou&s;e, that ought to be con&s;idered in connection with the Dean's idea of augu&s;tne&s;s. For the &s;ame rea&s;on that the Hou&s;e of Commons is intitled to deference and re&s;pect, Mr. Burke is, whether in or out of the Hou&s;e. In either ca&s;e his identity is the &s;ame; and as he is confe&s;&s;edly one of the mo&s;t &s;u|perior &s;peakers there, both with regard to the weight of argu|mentative ability, and ma&s;terly di&s;play of elocution, he certain|ly compri&s;es, in his &s;ingle per&s;on, a degree of augu&s;tne&s;s and pre-eminence beyond the <HI>one half</HI> of that a&s;&s;embly, made up of mere mono&s;yllabic <HI>yeas</HI> and <HI>noes;</HI> who, if they have capacity, <HI>cannot di&s;cover it,</HI> and if they have knowledge, <HI>cannot communi|cate it.</HI> The learned Dean, therefore, while he pays his tri|bute to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and, at the &s;ame time, would withhold it from Mr. Burke, undoes with his <HI>right</HI> hand what he had endeavoured to do with his <HI>left.</HI> This mu&s;t either be the amount of our Dean's attempt, or he mu&s;t be under&s;tood to mean, that the &s;tone and mortar of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the benches on which the members &s;it, actually con&s;titute <HI>the hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Waving, however, the point of contrariety between the Hou&s;e and Mr. Burke, to me it appears no breach of deference or re&s;pect for the augu&s;tne&s;s of the <HI>repre&s;entative body,</HI> in Parliament a&s;|&s;embled, to take up and canvas any &s;ubject, though in&s;tantly in deliberation before that body. The Clergy are always exce&s;|&s;ively complai&s;ant and well bred. The &s;ame right that autho|ri&s;es us to &s;end repre&s;entatives to Parliament, authorizes us to <HI>think, &s;peak,</HI> and <HI>write,</HI> even antecedent to the deci&s;ions of that a&s;&s;embly. Every member of a free &s;tate, &s;its in a greater than any Parliament Hou&s;e &mdash; in the area of Humanity, a theatre only bounded by the poles; where he &s;its and deliberates in right of a &s;ummons from the great CREATOR, in&s;tead of a writ i&s;&s;ued by the Speaker of a popular, local a&s;&s;embly. Re|&s;pect and deference in durance to the <HI>latter,</HI> and not to the <HI>for|mer,</HI> in their con&s;equential &s;tages of advance, always arrive at that ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which the de&s;pot cannot but contemplate with &s;atisfaction, and the vain empty man ever accepts of with avidity.</P>
<P>With regard to a plan of Coloni&s;tic accommodation, the point agitated between the&s;e two Gentlemen, &s;ingularly important and intere&s;ting as its con&s;equences would &s;eem, it can never be brought to any i&s;&s;ue, &s;o as to carry conviction to either of their bo&s;oms: they proceed on different data, and oppo&s;ite princi|ples. The Great Senator maintains that the Colonies are <HI>not</HI> in rebellion, but urged to &s;elf-defence, and irritated to ho&s;tile repul&s;ion, by arbitrary exaction, and high-handed a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments. On this ground the excellent &s;peaker has held forth a plan of accommodation, judicious, &s;olid, pertinent, and &s;alutary, alike becoming <HI>freemen</HI> to offer, and <HI>freemen</HI> to accept. The learned Dean, on the contrary, falls in with the mini&s;ter's majority in Parliament, and con&s;iders the Americans as <HI>rebels,</HI> flying in the face of the parent &s;tate, and aiming at a <HI>traitorous</HI> independence; hence have &s;ubjected them&s;elves to all that parliamentary indig|nation and re&s;entment, which have been avowed and put into executive force again&s;t them. The Rev. Dean has quite forgot here, that no one is a <HI>rebel</HI> till he has been proved &s;uch on trial before his peers, and at common law; and that to nickname and puni&s;h a man as a <HI>rebel</HI> or <HI>traitor,</HI> prior to his being tried and found guilty, is the &s;ame thing as to puni&s;h an individual, as a robber or murderer, before he has been proved &s;uch. A royal proclamation can neither <HI>make,</HI> nor <HI>&s;et a&s;ide</HI> law, except in France or Turkey: if it &s;upercedes trial at bar or by jury, it &s;upercedes courts of ju&s;tice, and renders Parliaments u&s;ele&s;s &mdash; In &s;hort, the Dean's rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions, in general, and to &s;ay the utmo&s;t of them, re&s;t upon one pillar only&mdash;the &s;upre|macy and omnipotence of Parliament: if the &s;ub&s;truction can be removed, the &s;uper&s;tructure falls of cour&s;e. Nothing can be &s;upreme or omnipotent, without being infallible al&s;o. Till Parliaments become ab&s;olutely infallible (I believe it will not happen in our day) Parliaments are&mdash;un-omnipotent and un-&s;u|preme. To &s;ay that Parliament is &s;upreme and omnipotent in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, is &s;aying that Lord North, or the o&s;ten&s;i|ble mini&s;ter for the time being, is &s;upreme and omnipotent in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. While the mini&s;ter holds the national bag, as Judas did his Ma&s;ter's, he turns Parliaments at plea&s;ure, as the winds turn the weathercock, but not (alas!) with the &s;ame innocence and want of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;It is no le&s;s notorious, than the fal&s;e grandeur, gaming, di&s;&s;ipation and &s;hameful luxury of the times, that <HI>placemen, pen&s;ioners,</HI> and <HI>military &s;ervants,</HI> al|ways make up the determining majority in both Hou&s;es, a packed, di&s;qualified, un-con&s;titutional junto, not excepting the Right Rev. Bench. Can &s;uch be called competent, equitable judges, any more than jurymen or witne&s;&s;es, in trials of life and death and property, who have been bribed and &s;uborned?&mdash;The ana|logy is pointed and deci&s;ive, and evinces with what maturene&s;s of judgment, as well as &s;uperiority of talents, the <HI>oratorial light</HI> of the Briti&s;h &s;enate revolved his &s;ubject. But, alas! the aera, the honourable and ine&s;timable aera, of <HI>accommodation</HI> is now over, in de&s;pite of a CHATHAM and a BURKE; who&s;e rea|&s;onings, one would have thought, were &s;ufficient to illuminate a world, in&s;tead of three in&s;ular &s;pots: the Americans have de|clared them&s;elves INDEPENDENT; while our egregious rulers, &s;itting on their hobby-hor&s;e of &s;upremacy and omnipotence, have the &s;weets of a &s;ugar plumb to roll in their mouths, for lo&s;ing one half divi&s;ion of a great empire, hitherto, in conjunc|tion with AMERICA, the arbitre&s;s of Europe, and empre&s;s of the &s;eas.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">COLONIZATION is the voluntary deliberate act of a few leaving the parent country, to begin an adopted one in a di&s;tant region, under the in|&s;tant di&s;advantages of an unknown &s;ituation (inha|bited

As our children run through the progre&s;&s;ive &s;tages of infancy, childhood, youth, manhood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and demand attentions from their parents applicable and appropriate to each &s;tage; &s;o do colonies, from their fir&s;t &s;ettlement to their ripe|ning into internal &s;ubordination and Empire; and are certainly intitled to attentions of a &s;imilar na|ture from the mother &s;tate. But by the police of all well con&s;tituted kingdoms, a certain time ar|rives, which we are accu&s;tomed to call the age of adultne&s;s, when nonage cea&s;es, when children be|come independent of parents, and privileged to commence, in their own per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of pro|perty, under no parental limitation or controul. In a corre&s;pondent way Colonies, by the per&s;eve|ring exerci&s;e of virtue and indu&s;try, the meliorati|on of their lands, and the exten&s;ion of their com|merce, added to the capital circum&s;tance of a prodigious, &s;till increa&s;ing, population, are autho|rized by the law of Nature and Providence, the only original binding moral law, to &s;tand on their own legs, and to do for them&s;elves, unconnected feudally or legi&s;latively with the parent State. In their political nonage, indi&s;putably, they felt, and grew beneath the protecting hand of the parent; who in return for protection, and by way of entire indemnification, beheld a concentration of the chil|dren's commercial goods and property annually pouring into her coffers: but &s;hall this monopoly be &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on and inforced, this &s;tated requital for favours received, when the favours are no long|er needed or required? Real children, under age, owe pa&s;&s;ive obedience to parents, as a return for

&s;upport and maintenance; but come of age, pa&s;&s;ive obedience cea&s;es of cour&s;e with the &s;upport and maintenance being no longer requi&s;ite. In both ca&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of the thing ought to &s;trike us with the full force and energy of truth.</P>
<P>Did not children at a certain time become inde|pendent of their parents, with regard to free agen|cy and moral accountablene&s;s, there would happen in an indefinite number of in&s;tances, &s;uch an accu|mulation of dome&s;tic government, as would &s;oon grow to be loaded with all the mi&s;eries and abomi|nations of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, perfectly oppre&s;&s;ive and un&s;ufferable, even to the de&s;truction of nati|onal police, and &s;ocialcompact. A father might live to be a great-grand-father, and under his ab&s;olute dominion in one hou&s;e, at the &s;ame time, have two or three hundred children, grand-children, and great-grand-children, accommodated and employ|ed re&s;pectively as he him&s;elf &s;hould arbitrarily dic|tate, often, perhaps, only influenced by the re&s;t|le&s;s lu&s;t of rule, caprice, &s;pleen, or unaccountable prejudice. In this way children &s;hould be incapa|citated to act as free members of a free &s;tate; &s;o that &s;uch a monopolization and perpetuation of do|me&s;tic authority, would not only interfere with, but end in, the total abolition of municipal free|dom, political &s;ubordination, and per&s;onal proper|ty. Wi&s;ely therefore have all governments, in &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, fixt the term of maturity, and the boundaries of adole&s;cential &s;ubjection: in &s;hort, &s;et children free from all tyes to parents, but tho&s;e of reverence, gratitude and affection, which are &s;pontaneous conditional duties, always at the com|mand of an excellent and de&s;erving object.</P>
<P>With regard to Colonies, the preci&s;e period of political adultne&s;s, has not been a&s;certained. For what power is competent to a&s;certain it? There are
<PB N="44" REF="43">
no vi&s;ible exi&s;ting powers, that we know of, above the kingdoms of this earth. It is therefore the alone province of Heaven to take the lead in this magnificent and magnitudinous affair; to fix the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of &s;upremacy on the one hand, and of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the other. Heaven, indeed, has not left the exact limits upon record, &s;o as not to be mi&s;taken: but the &s;en&s;e and will of Heaven may be clearly made out from the plaine&s;t deductions of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, which in many intricate and doubtful ca&s;es are our only guides, and the only infallible &s;tandard men have upon earth, in penetrating the art and di&s;gui&s;e of things; bring|ing forward primordial privileges, and authenticat|ing the &s;tamp of derived and delegated power, from that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ively underived and undelegated, except from Heaven.</P>
<P>Should we leave the deci&s;ion of the matter to parent &s;tates, the term of Colonian puberty would never arrive. States, as regulated by mere men, are as &s;ubject to a wretched poverty of intellect, a &s;ordid narrowne&s;s of &s;pirit, a &s;elfi&s;h mediocrity of conce&s;&s;ion, as individuals. Selfi&s;hne&s;s, though variou&s;ly habited and di&s;gui&s;ed, is the character|i&s;tic of poli&s;hed cultivated humanity, except in punctilious attentions to one another, among mem|bers of official departments, at levees, and in drawing-rooms. Where &s;hall we find an individu|al who will coolly and willingly relinqui&s;h to an|other what he looks upon as his &s;ole property, and the chief &s;upport of his per&s;onal &s;ignificance among mankind? Or where &s;hall we find a great kingdom that will coolly and willingly relinqui&s;h to a Colo|nian rival or cotemporary in power, what it looks upon as its &s;ole property, and the chief &s;upport of its territorial &s;ignification among nations? We mu&s;t not &s;eek for either in&s;tance in the latitudes of our
<PB N="45" REF="44">
earth. Yet the negative of conduct thrown into in|terrogation here, with re&s;pect to individuals, is the opprobrium of our nature, and the malady of all &s;ocieties; one &s;et of men gorged to the throat with luxury, another &s;et &s;tarving but for our alms on our dunghills: and with re&s;pect to nations, the &s;ame negative was the de&s;truction of the Grecian and Roman empires; which, in&s;tead of &s;upporting them&s;elves at the zenith of power and glory by the means that acquired them, internal virtue, tempe|rance and piety, vainly thought to con&s;olidate uni|ver&s;al dominion by exorbitant exactions, and arbi|trary &s;tretches of authority, in their di&s;tant provin|ces and colonies; whereby they rou&s;ed up &s;uch a &s;pirit of di&s;&s;atisfaction and re&s;entment, in the members again&s;t the head, as &s;oon i&s;&s;ued, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by interior vice, immorality and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, in their final ruin and extinction. Particular king|doms, therefore, mu&s;t not be admitted umpires to decide the weighty and momentous que&s;tion of Co|lonian maturity, or ripene&s;s for &s;elf-government.</P>
<P>A kingdom to all eternity (were kingdoms eter|nal) would no more give up its Colonies to the liber|ty and independence it&s;elf enjoys, than a tyranni|cal unnatural parent would wi&s;h to liberate a &s;on from his juri&s;diction, were he not liable to be for|ced by the law of his country, and, indeed, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, by the nece&s;&s;ity of the thing it&s;elf. But let the con&s;equences be &s;eriou&s;ly and candidly marked.</P>
<P>Were there no compul&s;ory &s;tatutes for the libe|ration of children from their parents, at a &s;pecified time, parents, even the mo&s;t opulent, would not be able to maintain their &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of offspring, except in wretchedne&s;s and penury; which in a ve|ry few generations would reduce the wealthie&s;t na|tions to the condition of Indians, living on the un|cultivated
<PB N="46" REF="45">
fruits of the earth, and the un&s;olicited fi&s;h crowding to their &s;hores. And even &s;hould indu&s;try be admitted to take place between a fa|ther and his &s;ons, &s;till the admi&s;&s;ion is &s;hackled with an ab&s;urdity impo&s;&s;ible to be thrown off, which would &s;hortly annihilate the whole pater-familial dyna&s;ty. In in&s;tances of di&s;agreements between fa|ther and &s;on, di&s;agreements not in the nature of things to be avoided, &s;trength, bodily &s;trength, would be the <HI>lex ultima judicandi,</HI> as force is confe&s;&s;|edly the <HI>ultima ratio regum.</HI> A &s;on might be very often &s;tronger than his father, or two or more &s;ons might con&s;pire again&s;t a father, and &s;ubdue him, whereby the whole dome&s;tic chain of government would be unlinked, while brawny limbs and ath|letic &s;houlders, not wi&s;e heads and experienced hoary locks, would bear off the chaplet of victory, and the younger reign in the elder's &s;tead.&mdash;</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the adult dome&s;tic period has been e&s;tabli&s;hed in all well regulated States, with a degree of &s;apient fore&s;ight on which their exi&s;tence, as well as property, depends. The adult period of Colonies comes next to be con&s;i|dered. Such a period, it has been ob&s;erved, would never arrive, were it left to the option and di&s;cre|tion of the Colonian parent. But notwith&s;tanding this peevi&s;h, impoveri&s;hed, and jaundiced maxim of State, &s;hall it never arrive? This is ju&s;t &s;aying, with more illiterate dogmati&s;m than truth, that States &s;hall never grow old, di&s;ea&s;ed, enfeebled, and decrepit; i. e. it is an attempt to &s;top the cour&s;e of Nature, arre&s;t the progre&s;s of mortal labefaction, and check the material di&s;&s;olution of parts; &s;u&s;pend the attrition of wheels, and coun|teract the wearing of machinery. States are &s;ub|ject to all the vici&s;&s;itudes of the human body; like it mu&s;t increa&s;e, decrea&s;e, and moulder into du&s;t.
<PB N="47" REF="46">
Shall an old pal&s;ied man then wre&s;tle with the young and vigorous? the di&s;ea&s;ed with the heal|thy? the weaker with the &s;tronger?&mdash;In other words, &s;hall parent States be eternal? and &s;hall Colonies never become parent States? Ab&s;urd and fanciful indeed!&mdash;Mark the extravagance and &s;elf-delu&s;ion here. In many &s;uppo&s;able ca&s;es, not to mention ca&s;es that have really happened, Colonies may become greater, wealthier, and more pow|erful, than the birth-giving State.

<P>All nations upon earth were once Colonies, ex|cept the fir&s;t &s;tationary &s;pot of its inhabitants: and even that may be called a Colony from Hea|ven, at lea&s;t &s;o long as the di&s;po&s;ition of Heaven reigned there, peace, love, friend&s;hip, and con|tent. All nations were once in the mo&s;t helple&s;s condition of infant territory, and na&s;cent civiliza|tion. How have the&s;e Colonies expiated the guilt of their becoming great and flouri&s;hing kingdoms, the terror and admiration of the world, the Ethi|opic, the Grecian, and the Roman? Lord North and his conclave of Senators ought to write male|dictory epitaphs to their memory; &s;end &s;ome of their order from their &s;ilent, or abu&s;ed &s;eats in Parliament, upon an ea&s;tern tour; and there in|&s;tead of falling down on their knees, with &s;epul|chral

<P>The progre&s;s from Colonian nonage and imbe|cility to the adultne&s;s and lu&s;tihood of empire, has been as ob&s;ervable, &s;ince the beginning of time, as the growth of the human body from in|fancy to manhood. The world may be called a great body made up of continents, i&s;lands, em|pires, kingdoms, principalities, and &s;tates, its in|dividuals in a <HI>figurative</HI> &s;en&s;e; a kingdom likewi&s;e is a great le&s;&s;er body, made up of men and women, its individuals in a <HI>real</HI> &s;en&s;e. Men and Women have a progre&s;&s;ion of growth from birth to the period of legal maturity. Nothing can ob&s;truct or limit this regular growth without doing vio|lence to God and Nature, as well as &s;ociety; a crime, multiform and penal, equal to mutilation, maiming, di&s;membering, partially robbing life of its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or totally de&s;troying it. Empires, kingdoms and &s;tates, have likewi&s;e a progre&s;&s;ion of increa&s;e from their fir&s;t colonizing exi&s;tence to the ripened aera of their independence: nothing can ob&s;truct or limit this regular increa&s;e, without doing violence to God in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the King of <HI>all</HI> kings, and the Lord of <HI>all</HI> lords; a crime for which kings, mini&s;ters, and parliaments mu&s;t be one day as re&s;pon&s;ible, as tho&s;e tyrants and mon&s;ters that would, by external implements

and force (a thing quite po&s;&s;ible) &s;top the growth of an infant to a child; of a child to a youth; or of a youth to a man.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be the true and unaffected view of the &s;ubject, unwarpt by party, and unallied to worldly hopes and fears; which alas! too often &s;erve to &s;ilence the voice of truth, fully its bright|ne&s;s, or muddy its channels. It is &s;o obvious and rea&s;onable, that I cannot help wondering it does not &s;trike every mind left to its own freedom, and not aba&s;hed to borrow light from Chri&s;tianity; that admirable, but not half enough admired &s;y&s;tem of right conduct, pure equity, di&s;intere&s;ted ju&s;tice, genuine ambition, refined morals, exqui&s;ite philo|&s;ophy, gentle affections, and generous principles; without which, adopted and revered in courts and cabinets, no kingdoms can ri&s;e to greatne&s;s, be|come greatne&s;s, or &s;ecure greatne&s;s, any more than individuals.

<P>Many people, in the official departments of the State, who &s;omehow or other imagine them&s;elves called upon to defend Government at all hazards, whether right or wrong, will probably be very rea|dy to exclaim again&s;t the bold and free &s;pirit of the&s;e remarks, not <HI>&s;pying the beam in their own eye.</HI> Politicians, indeed, are not obliged to be good Chri&s;tians. They will call them Republican, and in their latitude and tendency dangerous to civil Admini&s;tration, as well as di&s;re&s;pectful to the K&mdash;. Yet &s;uch per&s;ons will as probably never reflect, that while the foregoing remarks can only do imaginary harm, even upon their own &s;uppo&s;iti|on of their being dangerous, they them&s;elves do &s;ub&s;tantial irreparable harm to the State, to their King and Country, by the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s and profli|gacy of their live. It &s;carcely can be denied, that mo&s;t of our Rulers are men of gro&s;s morals and ir|religious private conduct. It may be argued, they are not wor&s;e than other members of the State: But if they are no better, they are virtually wor&s;e; as per&s;ons in power and tru&s;t ought to be exem|plary for &s;uperior and uncommon virtues.

<P>Luxury, effeminacy, and &s;en&s;uality, the&s;e are the hydra evils that hurt a State, &s;ap the foundati|ons of Government, and undermine &s;lowly but &s;urely, the platform of municipal freedom; while the E&s;&s;ay Writer, with the wor&s;t intentions, only gives the world an opportunity to examine, and in ca&s;es of error in his po&s;itions, of confuting him.

No theoretical rea&s;oning, or &s;peculative opinions, can di&s;turb or periclitate a State, though they may di&s;turb and periclitate men in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of abu&s;ed power, and ill-acquired opulence. If bad, they are ea&s;ily an&s;wered, and as a&s;&s;ignable to oblivion, as rockets and &s;oap-bubbles into air.

<P>The command of the powers of a State, and &s;elf-command, being at the head of Government, and at the head of &s;elf-government, are quite dif|ferent things.

<P>Providence has great and important revolutions to bring about in the world, before it become what we are a&s;&s;ured by the prophetic Spirit it mu&s;t be|come, before the termination of all things. God originally was the only acknowledged King among mankind; but as &s;oon as vice, wickedne&s;s and ido|latry, began to prevail, men in different &s;ocieties and dyna&s;ties, appointed Kings for them&s;elves. God continuing to be their King by the emba&s;&s;ado|rial medium of teachers and prophets, would have been a con&s;tant trouble&s;ome admonitory check on their enormities, an awful living evidence again&s;t them. Re&s;olved, therefore, upon immorality, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t corruptions, they agreed to emancipate them&s;elves from Heaven, and choo&s;e Kings and rulers, that they well knew would be as immoral and corrupt as them&s;elves, nay, in many in&s;tances take the lead in every abomination. The Jewi&s;h nation was one remarkable in&s;tance of this: we have it upon the mo&s;t authentic record. While they pre&s;erved primaeval innocence and &s;implicity, they rejoiced and were ble&s;&s;ed in their theocratic
<PB N="66" REF="65">
polity: but when they became deba&s;ed and pollu|ted by the Heathen nations around, and captivated with their vain kingly pageantry, they boldly and riotou&s;ly demanded an earthly king from Samuel the me&s;&s;enger of Heaven, as they them&s;elves ex|pre&s;s it, <HI>that we may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us and fight our battles.</HI> The degeneracy of the Jews, and their lu&s;t after a vi&s;ible temporal King, in imitation of the Pagan world, commenced together; which demon&s;trates a degree of analogy between kingly domination, and the unre&s;trained practice of private vice and corruption, not to be re&s;i&s;ted. As immedi|ate communications with Heaven would always have had the effect of controuling ba&s;e and unworthy pa&s;&s;ions; therefore, &s;o &s;oon as mankind wi&s;hed freely to indulge them, they were re&s;tle&s;s and un|happy till that communication was cut off. Since that fatal and degrading epoch, things have conti|nued in the channel of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and debauch|ery to this day. Courts, generally &s;peaking, are the centre and licen&s;ed purlieus of corruption, vice and immorality, with a gauze-thin decorum and breeding, indeed, that would gild and varni&s;h the want of virtue and integrity. But things will not, cannot la&s;t long in this retrograde path of re|formation and moral improvement. As the world fir&s;t began with the theocratic form of government, it will certainly al&s;o end with it, how far &s;oever we really are at pre&s;ent from it. Kings and kingdoms are oppo&s;ing and counter-acting one another, while they all alike wallow in the foule&s;t vices and crimes. Thus in the end they will de&s;troy one another, or be de&s;troyed by formidable evils from Heaven; till the in&s;uperable nece&s;&s;ity &s;hall &s;tare men in the face, of recurring to the fir&s;t in&s;titution of all, Theocracy, in the mean time fitting them&s;elves for

<P>Before this glorious and happy renovation, how|ever, can take place, mankind mu&s;t have the mo&s;t generous, pure, and exqui&s;ite conceptions of Li|berty, quite the rever&s;e of what it is at this igno|minious day throughout the world, if we except tho&s;e critical, unparalleled and a&s;toni&s;hing &s;truggles in one great continental divi&s;ion of it. God can|not act &s;entimentally in arbitrary governments or among &s;laves, till he fir&s;t work a miracle by in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly changing mens minds. Such in&s;tru|ments would never pu&s;h forward &s;chemes de&s;truc|tive of them&s;elves, which all &s;chemes of manly freedom, virtuous independence, and moral &s;elf-denial would be; nor can a thorough reformation of manners and principles take place in any State, where a political e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; becau&s;e &s;uch a reformation would be an act of di&s;|&s;ent and non-conformity, altogether &s;ubver&s;ive of that e&s;tabli&s;hment. Be&s;ides, in all national e&s;ta|bli&s;hments the &s;howy appearance of duty, pompous rites and ceremonies, take off from mens reverence for the reality, nay, actually &s;upercede it in nine hundred and ninety in&s;tances of a thou&s;and. When we have proved to our fellow-creatures that we are religious, by going to the &s;ame place of public wor&s;hip, and uttering over and over the &s;ame re|&s;pon&s;es with them, we &s;eldom think of any thing farther: I keep my neighbour in countenance, and my neighbour keeps me; over and above that, my neighbour is always before my eyes, but God is invi&s;ible. Great-Britain and Ireland, there|fore, (with &s;orrow and pain I make the ob&s;ervati|on) can never be made in&s;trumental to bring about tho&s;e grand political re&s;torations, and religious re|forms, which &s;ome time or another certainly mu&s;t

happen. Should they ever be effected in the&s;e kingdoms, it mu&s;t be through the medium of per|&s;ons unconnected by corruption with the court, and by creeds with a national hierarchy. Courts and hierarchies <HI>&s;wear</HI> and <HI>take bribes,</HI> to pre&s;erve inviolate their re&s;pective in&s;titutions; how then can they be made in&s;truments to perjure them&s;elves, and &s;ave highway-men the trouble, by picking their own pockets? moreover, Truth requires no forms of adjuration among its friends, nor Virtue any undue influence to be u&s;ed to in&s;ure its practice.

The power that made and has all a long &s;u&s;tained a con&s;tituti|on, if, in the hands of unfaithful and arbitrary go|vernors, it counteracts its original purpo&s;es, and
<PB N="73" REF="72">
has a certain unequivocal tendency to overthrow the per&s;onal freedom of the &s;ubject, for the guar|dian&s;hip of which it was alone conceived and elabo|rated, &s;uch a power, I &s;ay, may and ought to <HI>un|make and break it to pieces,</HI> in order to throw the materials into a more perfect mold, to produce a more perfect impre&s;&s;ion. The People, the aggre|gate power-giving body of the &s;tate, are the almigh|ty and unre&s;pon&s;ible cau&s;e, here alluded to, as alone adequate to &s;uch an effect.</P>
<P>A political con&s;titution is like a clock or a watch, as being of artificial &s;tructure and durability. With|out any imputable guilt or feeling of remor&s;e, the arti&s;t takes the latter machinery a&s;under, when the wheels and &s;prings have been ob&s;tructed or worn down beyond repair, and &s;ub&s;titutes new in their place. The former piece of machinery, though of the highe&s;t order of human device and fabrication, mu&s;t likewi&s;e be taken a&s;under, as often as its de|fects become irreparable, and its wa&s;tes un&s;upplia|ble; neither is there delinquency, or any cau&s;e for compunction, in the one ca&s;e more than the other. Indeed, as they differ pre-eminently in excellence and value, the care, the accurate in&s;pection, the delicate demur, the deliberative maturene&s;s of fi|nal judgment, &s;hould in an equal degree be pre|eminent, re&s;pecting the one in&s;tance above the other. By the unque&s;tionable analogy between the fir&s;t and the la&s;t, &s;taring them in the face in all free &s;tates, the executive &s;ervants of government, the official members of the empire, are kept in order, and long effectually prevented from running into the exce&s;&s;es of tyranny and ari&s;tocratici&s;m. The whole po&s;ition is rational, and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Kings and &s;tate&s;men, without the People to feed, clothe, and defend them, &s;hould be nothing more
<PB N="74" REF="73">
reputable or &s;table, in their high &s;ituations, than corks blown about by the winds on the &s;urface of the waters, or buoys cut away from their anchors. Kings and mini&s;ters of &s;tate, while they &s;o unac|countably <HI>idolize</HI> them&s;elves and accept of <HI>idolatry</HI> from all around them, (the abject homage paid them de&s;erves no other name) think not of the a|bove humiliating, circum&s;tance, which reduces them, from their recept-offices of incen&s;e, to the butter-fly, deprived of his wings, or the ma&s;ter bee di&s;armed of his &s;ting.</P>
<P>The elected, repre&s;entative, magi&s;tratical depart|ments of &s;ociety have pre&s;umed &s;o extravagantly on their derived and adventitious greatne&s;s, have taken &s;uch gigantic &s;trides in office towards de&s;poti&s;m, that they mu&s;t indeed be brought to their proper level, pro&s;trate in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion at the foot&s;tool of their creators&mdash;the People.</P>
<P>By the People I would not be under&s;tood to mean, a riotous mob, a tumult at the market-cro&s;s, or a county in&s;urrection, (from which at all times, <HI>good God, deliver us;</HI>) but the honourable and re|&s;pectable, Yeomanry of the realm, the middle cla&s;s of citizens and country gentry, who&s;e wealth, in the gro&s;s, is the principal wealth of the nation, and &s;upport of government, and who&s;e education, principles, &s;tudies and manners, qualify and intitle them to direct the lowe&s;t orders of &s;ociety, and controul the highe&s;t, &s;hould <HI>the&s;e</HI> to any dangerous length exceed their delegated tru&s;t, or <HI>tho&s;e</HI> di&s;co|ver a forwardne&s;s to ru&s;h into ha&s;ty a&s;&s;ociation, and violent in&s;urgency.</P>
<P>Nothing can be a &s;tronger proof of our degene|racy, infatuation, and ripene&s;s for &s;ome revoluti|on, that will &s;everely puni&s;h while it brings us to our &s;en&s;es and reforms us, than two con&s;iderations which &s;hall now be mentioned with brevity, but
<PB N="75" REF="74">
pointedne&s;s. While the Briti&s;h empire is in the &s;tate of being rent like a garment from top to bot|tom, while Briti&s;h glory has been brought under a total eclip&s;e, and Briti&s;h honour pa&s;&s;es as a problem among the nations, the &s;ons of Britain, in a di&s;|ea&s;ed trance of ignoble ambition, are &s;oliciting and procuring vain empty titles from the crown, which, in the ab&s;ence of virtue, are no more than the co|lours flying of a &s;hip, after its hulk has been eaten through and through with worms, or her rudder, cables and anchors, lo&s;t in a Storm. The m&mdash; o&mdash;t&mdash;t, after having brought his own into di&s;pute, and endangered the real honour of the nation, by gra&s;ping at too much power and dominion, and &s;et one part of his &s;ub&mdash; to rob and murder the other, con&s;oles him&s;elf with throwing away fictiti|ous nominal honours (the di&s;po&s;al of which was lodged with him by the People for a quite different purpo&s;e) on men who&s;e only merit con&s;i&s;ts in hu|mouring and flattering him in Par&mdash;s and Priv&mdash; Coun&mdash;s. This con&s;ideration at once &s;erves to point out the political di&s;ea&s;e of the times, and its apparent eventual termination. The other is this, In the above recited melancholy &s;ituation of public affairs, our nobles and gentry, in&s;tead of being rou&s;ed to &s;elf-reformation, and hereby (the only po&s;&s;ible method) recommending the fleets and armies of Britain to the protection and ble&s;&s;ing of Hea|ven, are hurrying into every &s;cene of vice, folly, di&s;&s;ipation and debauchery, hor&s;e-races, cock-fights, gambling tables, ma&s;querades, pantomimes, farces and &s;tews: while the public teachers of the land, the clergy, either look on with total uncon|cern, or actually partake them&s;elves of &s;uch ill-timed plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements, the lawn-&s;leeve bi&s;hop, and his powdered chaplain, equally lo&s;t to a &s;en&s;e of honour and duty. This is a fact notorious to
<PB N="76" REF="75">
every eye, and in the face of the &s;un calls upon Heaven to puni&s;h us as a nation and People. GOD, however, brings good out of evil. He has made us in&s;truments to render a <HI>great Continent</HI> wi&s;e at our expence, to check the inhabitants in their ca|reer of luxury, and recal them to the almo&s;t de&s;ert|ed paths of piety and virtue, and hereby opened an <HI>immen&s;e future a&s;ylum</HI> for the good of all nations, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted of all regions.&mdash;It is acknowledged, in the mid&s;t of this black and di&s;mal pro&s;pect, the Colonies <HI>(defending them&s;elves)</HI> in a &s;tate of formidable revolt, and France and Spain ready to take advantage of our blundering and di&s;tracted councils, our wretched national na|kedne&s;s and imbecility; that the <HI>fa&s;hionable routine</HI> of public wor&s;hip (like mo&s;t other <HI>fa&s;hions</HI>) on &s;undays and holidays, goes regularly on: but alas! in this re&s;pect, we are no better than the Jews were of old, <HI>&s;cribes and phari&s;ees, hypocrites,</HI> when CHRIST delivered <HI>this</HI> prediction, which was af|terwards literally accompli&s;hed. <HI>Ma&s;ter, fee what manner of &s;tones, and what buildings are here! Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, &s;ee&s;t thou tho&s;e great buil|dings?</HI> (our Cathedrals and Churches) <HI>There &s;hall not be left one &s;tone upon another, that &s;hall not be thrown down!</HI>&mdash;It is likewi&s;e acknowledged, that we have had a <HI>public fa&s;t-day</HI> appointed, by authority, for Great Britain and Ireland, the Priv&mdash; Coun&mdash; of E&mdash; obliged, though fomewhat <HI>unbecomely late,</HI> to follow the example of the Americans, without the pure piety, and virtuous patrioti&s;m, of the&s;e determined Continen|tali&s;ts: but Almighty God has condemned and reprobated (for ever) all &s;uch deceitful hypocriti|cal &s;ervice, the mere flouri&s;h of ambitious, tem|porizing eccle&s;ia&s;tics, impo&s;ing on the facile unex|amining &s;pirit of their S&mdash;; the mere <HI>rant</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="76">
of a party, the mere <HI>hue-and-cry</HI> of a mercenary political e&s;tabli&s;hment. Here follow the words of in&s;piration, which <HI>ought</HI> to &s;trike all k&mdash;s, priv&mdash; coun&mdash;s, proclam&mdash;s, Right and Mo&s;t Rev. Bi&s;hops, <HI>dumb for ever.

<P>However unfa&s;hionable, unpopular, and un|courtly the introduction of <HI>Scripture</HI> into a politi|cal tract, I cannot help tran&s;cribing here another &s;triking pa&s;&s;age from the mo&s;t venerable book in the world. From which it appears, that the ordi|nary bu&s;ine&s;s of life going on in its accu&s;tomed progre&s;&s;ive channel, added to the mo&s;t &s;oothing and flattering ideas of home-&s;ecurity, in&s;tead of forming a barrier again&s;t overwhelming general calamities, rather tend to create &s;u&s;picions of their approach, when a nation has lo&s;t its internal cha|racter of integrity, temperance, truth, virtue, ju&s;|tice and clemency. Notwith&s;tanding our pre&s;ent <HI>&s;eeming</HI> tranquility and &s;afety, in Great Britain and Ireland, it is certain that the effort towards over|turning the principles of our <HI>once</HI> happy and en|vied con&s;titution has been made, the &s;troke of de&s;poti&s;m &s;truck, in AMERICA.&mdash;The Americans are Britons by de&s;cent as well as we; in &s;pirit our equals, in genuine patrioti&s;m our &s;uperiors: every article of freedom we enjoy, <HI>they</HI> have an equal right to enjoy; therefore, mini&s;terial oppre&s;&s;ion ex|erting

it&s;elf <HI>there,</HI> is the &s;ame thing, with regard to the &s;afety and &s;tability of the empire at large, as if it had been exerted <HI>here.</HI> Tyranny failing in its attempts on the other &s;ide the Atlantic, we &s;hall be &s;afe at home: &s;hould it however, &s;ucceed, we &s;hall as &s;urely be undone, with the &s;atisfaction indeed, the exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction, of being the la&s;t, indulgent|ly, that &s;hall be devoured by the hideous mon&s;ter. &mdash;But what an act of folly and madne&s;s, not to be a|larmed when our neighbour's hou&s;e is on fire, be|cau&s;e the flames have not as yet catched hold of our own!&mdash;The&s;e are the words of a Per&s;onage above all kings and legi&s;lators what&s;oever.&mdash;<HI>They did eat, they drank,&mdash;they married wives&mdash;they were given in marriage&mdash;until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and de&s;troyed them all.
