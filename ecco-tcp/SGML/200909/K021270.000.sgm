<P>Look'e, Adelaide, I would not be thought inqui&s;itively

my wife and I have been debating the matter all night; and, for the fir&s;t
time, I believe, this &s;even years, we are both in one mind. In con&s;equence
of our determina|tion, I come to offer you my &s;on; we are convinced your
birth is as good as ours; and as to fortune, if any <PB N="55" REF="60"> chance
has robbed you of that, 'tis lucky my boy has a good &s;winging one to put in
his &s;cale, which would otherwi&s;e be overbalanced by your merit. Confide
then to us the &s;ecret of your di&s;tre&s;s; I know before|hand, 'tis
&s;omething that will make you more re&s;pec|table in our eyes, for it is

<P>Sir, I acknowledge that the notice you have been plea&s;ed to
take of me, is a di&s;tinction, with which I had no right to flatter my&s;elf.
I confe&s;s, al&s;o, that I ought to look upon the offer of your &s;on, as a
very high compliment; your unparalleled kindne&s;s will never be era&s;ed from

you; you'll find no more Blai&s;es and Renettes; you'll be an object of envy to
